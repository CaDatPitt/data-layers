 Plans are under consideration for
thererection of a flag _pole as a cinem-
orial to the class of 1912 thirty feet

leading to;"State hall with a cement
base made at the stone seats. It has
been the custom for the classes that
have‘ graduated to place a memorial
for their class on the campus, but
trees have generally been used ‘for
this purpose. The class of 1912' how-
ever, has departed from this rule,
offering this handsome‘ ﬂagpole‘ in-

The money for the memorial has
not been lacking, but‘the,proposa.l has

THE PITT QUICK ' 
LUNCHEON CLUB.

' In THE PITT WEEKLY Alumni
Columns last week, we told of plans
for forming a “Pitt Quick Lunch club”
at a downtown restaurant——Mil1er’s
on Smithﬁeld st., where the graduates
could drop in at lunch time and be
sure to ﬁnd some‘ Pitt men. Several
additions to the lunching crowd have
been added and -there is lots of room
for others. If the number grows suf-
ﬁciently we can secure a-private room
for this and have it for our use dur-
ing the entire year.‘ The younger
graduates .are especially desired ~‘fo‘r
this. You can get all the latest gossip
of the University‘ there and will meet.
many fellows who you were close to
when in college. , .

SENATE TAKES, CHARGE

 Elections being held today in _-all
on-campus schools of the University,

tution as it was ﬁnally, reported by
the constitutional convention, are the
culminating steps in a long series of
events of a" more or less sensational
nature, which have characterized the
student politics of the University for
the past year. Formal action was
taken at last "Friday’s assembly by
the student body, signifying,their de-

it stands, following meeting of the
student board of control and of the

. , convention last’ Wednesday ’evening,

at which the board instructed ‘its

‘ president to call for such a. vote at

the Friday convocation, and the con-
vention made its ﬁnalchanges in the
form of the document.

, I Monday morning several of the

school senates held meetings and. in-
structed their presidents to hold the
proposed election today. The other
members of the board of control
readily acceded, and the result is the
campus-wide balloting now being car-
ried on. According‘ to the announce-
ments of two of the schools, the polls
are open from 9:30 to 3:‘30,'thvus giv-
ing all students a reasonable oppor-
tunity to register their opinions. The
voting is being done’ by printed bal-
lot, as indicated below, and ‘is upon
theacceptance or rejection of the con-
stitution‘~as a whole, or ofparticular
articles or _sections. A two-thirds vote
is required‘ for ratiﬁcation, and the en-
tire action is. subject to the reviewlof
the Board of ‘Trustees of the Univer-
The officials in charge of the
balloting for the various schools are
conducting the-election at separate
polling-places, . and are checking off
'the~n‘ames of those eligible from the
regularly classiﬁed lists from the
offices of the various deans.‘

: At the time of going to press, there

" was little that would indicate the out-

come of~‘today’s election, and no ‘pre-
dictions as to theresult of the vote
were being. ‘ventured. = Should the
‘constitution ‘be , adopted, several
fundamental changes will take place
in the student government, with which
the student body are generally ac-
quainted.‘ The Spring election day,
as provided in the new constitution is
only two weeks off,‘ and the office-
seekers for the many places which
will be open at that time must get in
their electioneering quickly. The new
‘constitution requires nomination peti-
tions to be‘ signed by five properly
qualiﬁed students. and announcements
to beﬁmade in THE WEEKLY and
upon the bulletin boards not later
than ten -days before the election
which would‘ make next Monday the
ﬁnal day. It is possible that this‘ pro-
vision can not be strictly observed,
owing ‘to thebriefness of the time re-
maining,-such contingency being pro-
vided for by an exclusion ‘clause in
the last article of the constitution.
This article likewise authorizes the
members of the constitutional conven-
tion to hold the spring election the
board of control’s official administra-
tion terminating with today’s election,
if the new system is adopted. Candi-
“dates-for the various offices are ex-
pected to get their petitions into the
hands of the proper persons so that
they may receive due publicity within
the next week. A

The changes 7 in‘ the constitution
which were made at theﬁnal meeting
of the convention are printed upon an-
other page of THE WEEKLY.

SEVERAL AMENDMENTS

Several amendments to the consti-
tution of the Women’s Activity asso-

offered for ratiﬁcation by the mem-
bers. According to the new plans,
AArticle's 3, 5, and 7 are to be amend-

The present constitution stipulates
that in the event of the submission’ of
any proposed amendments for ratiﬁ-

Team Left Monday on Eastern
Invasion; Only One Game to
be Played.

ALLEGHENY I I HERE NEXT

Pitt’s baseballers left Monday _night
for a sharp raidinto the East——an,
invasion of no great length, but of ut-
most _ iI£2:£>.ortance. as ..-.<.=9r_A¢erns, '
standing‘ of the Blue and Gold in the
baseball world. Only two games were
to be-played, but on account of wet
grounds no game was played at
Princeton . This is the second suc-
cessive year that the husky Pitt tribe
has challenged the Tiger» in his own
lair. 'Last spring the honor went to
Princeton by a 3-2 score, after nine
bitter innings, Langdon losing the
‘glory of a two-hit victory because of
leaky ﬁelding behind him. ‘

-This afternoon the Varsity holds
forth against the Middies at Annapo-
lis. This will be the third athletic
meeting between these‘ rivals this
year, Pitt taking the lead in football
and the Sailors walking‘ away with
the swimming-honors.- Next week the
last contest of the year between the
two institutions will be staged on the
tennis court.‘ Hart ‘is . the twirling
choice for this afternoon’s game, _and
will probably belopposed by Blodgett,
who was one of the Navy’s stellar per-
formers on ‘the gridiron last fall. ‘

Mt. St. Marys was on the schedule
for a game on Monday, but theywere
forced because of a crippled team to.
cancel the contest. This left only the
two games for the trip, and made it
possible to secure practice on Monday,
at which some of the glaring faults
visible in the -.West Virginia game
were pointed outand a remedy pre-
scribed. ' , ‘ . A

The party which left Monday night
was headed by Manager Williamson
and Coach Wilson,‘ and included the
following players: Captain Healy,
Langdon, Hart, Riehl, Beatt-ie, Matson‘
Peck, Hastings, -DeHart, orrow, Dil-
lon. Englehardt and Gray. The team
will leave "Annapolis tonight, reaching
Pittsburgh early tomorrow morning.

The next game at home is- with
Allegheny College -next Wednesday,
on‘ Trees Field. Pitt will be out for
blood that day, in revenge for the de-
hands at
Meadville two weeks ago, and the
struggle should bea warm one. It
is al-most certain that Brookmire, who
took the Varsity’s measure in the
earlier game, will again .be Alle-
gheny’s pitching selection; and; this
will be another reason for hard work
by the ‘Blue and Gold battalion.

wish that it -were’ possible,5 or that

as it eventually will, that such‘ teams

University in“ all its varsity contests.
If there has been censure on.th_e part
of anyone towar any ‘factor in the

and cannot apply to this team; or to
the policy which produced it. One of
these men will unfortunately he lost

they will come out for the team next

and perfectly co-ordinated machine,
that debating can ever be placed {upon
the footing which it can and should
"occupy, one "level with its rank ‘in

The other cause for advance is in
the. organization recently inaugurated
by the debating squad, forthe placing
of forensic upon _an eﬂ"icrentbusiness
basis, and the gaming of a chapter in
the national honorary debating fra-
ternity. This .is- a forward stepof.
the right sort. It will mean the
scheduling of several extensive {grips
for the.‘ University debating teams, .in
the course of the seaso_n_of. 1915-1916,

er of the activities of Pitt _to warrant
the posibility of." ‘incurring,_s_uch a
charge in the case of an activity like
debating which’ so vitally concerns the

University as, a whole. We recommend
to those in. charge a policy of expan-

Voters of Capabilities of Men
Selected by Nominating Com-
mittee.

ANNUAL ELECTION IN JUNE

In accordance with the general plan
of publicity, with a view to letting

the second series of pre-election write-
ups. It is suggested that the voters
save all’ copies of the WEEKLY with
these write-ups in and when the of-
ficial ballot is received, go over them
carefully. This will enable them to
form a wise decision as to who are
entitled to their vote. There are 25
men to be elected to Council this
year and the Nominations Committee
list numbers 31.-

The ballots will go out 10 days be-
fore the date of the annual meeting,

Following are the write-ups:-—

ALUMNI TO HEAR
Y HOME CONCERT.

Alumni are urged to give the
“Home Concert” of the University
Musical clubs, to be held at Carnegie
Music Hall, Friday night, their unlim-
ited support. This is one of the stud-
ent activities that has been coming
forward with leaps and bounds and
the concert this year promises to be
the best we have ever had. The mus-
icians have been practicing faithfully
for many weeks and are prepared to
give a concert that will send the
audience home enthusiastic.

The support of the alumni in an ac-
tivity of this kind is necessary just
as it is for football, baseball, and
other athletic activities. The candi-
dates for these teams have to work
just as hard as do the athletes and
don’t get is much recognition. It will
encourage the’ singers and instrumen-
talists to see a big outpouring of the
“old grads” at the concert.

If you haven’t tickets, call up the
Alumni office, 168 Grant, and the Sec-
retary will gladly get them for you. _

VARSITY LETTER CLUB
BUTTONS HERE

The oﬁicial buttons for the “Var-
'sity Letter club’? were received last
week and are now in the hands of all
who ordered them. The buttons are
beauties and are something that every
men who won the varsity insignia will
be vary glad to exhibit. They are
lapel buttons of small and neat design,
being solid gold and blue enamel back-
ground and the word “Varsity” and
letter “P” in gold. Fifty of the but-

they have all been disposed of.
Another order is now being gotten up
and those who wish them are asked
to communicate at once with the Club
Secretary, Robert E. Grove, c-o J. W.
Grove Co., Liberty ave., or the Gen-
eral Alumni Secretary, 421 Park
building. _ '

If you have won your letter in any
branch of athletics at the University,
you should certainly be a member of
this Club and have a button. It is
the one thing that will, in a modest
way, designate you as a letter man at
all the University gatherings.

Dr. CARHART HONOR GUEST

‘The work of interesting members
of classes scheduled for reunions at
Commencement time is progressing
and the oﬂicers of all the later class-
es—1906,'1907, 1908, 1910, 1912, and
1914--will soon get their notices out
to all members, outlining the reunion
program, and urging their attend-
ance. V
. The class of 1910 has been especi-
ally active and has made definite ar-
rangements for “doings“ on Alumni
Day,- Tuesday, June‘ 15th. Last year,
snap shot pictures of the class tree

was taken with John O’Connor, Frank -

Ramsey and Harry Reizenstein, active
1910 workers, under it. Prints have

ing sent to all members of the class
with the inscription “Under_the 1910

there in 1915?”
With the print is a letter, telling

of reunion plans and asking that every 9

1910'gradluate reserve the date and
arrange to spend the entire day at the
University. This year’s picture will
be taken at 2:30 p. m. underthe tree
and a‘ full attendance of the‘ class is
asked. As is generally known, the
class of 1910 was the ﬁrst to gradu-
ate from the Schenley Farms campus
and they had the honor of planting
the ﬁrst class tree on the campus. It
is located near Thaw hall and has a
bronze tablet set nearby, with the in-

scription “This tree planted by the '

Class of 1910, June 15, 1915.” The
custom suggested in the last issue of
the “WEEKLY,” whereby a class pic-
ture will be taken at the tree every
reunion year will be faithfully follow-
ed and this will give them a tradition
that will help bring the bunch back to
the campus every reunion season. It
is hoped that other classes will follow
the same plan.-

The 1910’ers expect to have Prof.
Daniel (“Uncle Dan”) Carhart as
their honor‘ guest at ‘the reunion ban-
qiuet which will likely be held at the
Pittsburgh Athletic association. Prof.
Carhart is loved by all the “grads”
and every one will be anxious to see
him again and talk over old times. At
the last 1910 banquet Dr. Albert E.
(“Mother”) Frost. was the guest of
honor, the custom being to recognize
some of the older professors of the
University at these reunion affairs.

The class of 1914, Marcus A. Fol-
lansbee, president, is getting busy.
Follansbee has been provided with a
list of addresses of the men and will
get letters_ to them in the near future.

Our Men’s “Colyum”

What An Experienced Salesman Means
To The Man Selecting a New Suit

The writer stopped in the
Clothing department today to
look himself over in‘ some of
the new Summer mOdels—of
which there are many.

The salesman produced a
new " wide lapel, three-button
model; the pattern was a
happy Summer check. The
writer-tried it On. It seemed
just right. But the salesman
said, “Wait a minute.”

He produced another, and
another and a fourth. Each
different, and each struck the
writer as more suited to him
than the last.

Then the salesman quietly
produced a ﬁfth. “This is the
suit fo-r you,i’ he said. And it
was! It’s lines, its stripe, its
fit around the collar and
shoulder seemed to encompass
anything the writer’s Wish
could conceive as the proper
suit for himself.

The salesman knew this was
the suit the writer should have
had from the very beginning,
‘but he used this method of ex-
hibiting his knowledge of ﬁt
and becomingness. “We have
this model at $15.00, $20.00
and $25.00,” he explained—“a
little better tailoring and
trimming distinguishing the
different prices.”

We mention this incident
as an example of the value of
trained salesman to a custom-
er. All our salesmen are
trained men, and their best
experience and knowledge is
at your service.

have a banquet on the evening of
Alumni Day.

The class of 1912, L. W. Mclntyre,
president, was among the ﬁrst to act
and will have a banquet.

The Secretary has asked Prof. V. S.
Lambie of the Department of Civil

Engineering, who is a 1907 man, to;

work up the reunion plans for his
class. W. J. Weldin of the class of
1906, and H. D. Magaw of the class of
1908, have also been communicated
with, with a view of having them get
their classes together.

Members of any of these classes

who wish further details should com‘-I

municate with the Alumni Secretary
and he will see that the letters get in

ithe hands of the proper parties. _We
;hope to have deﬁnite data regarding
the 1906, 1907 and 1908 reunions for
the next issue of the WEEKLY.

The four classes~—1887, 1888, 1889
jand‘ 1890-——may be gotten together in
tone group for some affair on Alumni
;Day and, if possible, the same plan
‘will be followed with the real old
iclasses——1868 to 1871, inclusive-—and
11849 to 1852, inclusive. The greatest
}emphasis is bein glaid on getting the
gmembers of the later classes back
gas, if they can have successful affairs,
;a tradition will be established, and
class reunions at the scheduled time,

gwill be assured for ﬁuture years.

SNAKES LOSE

T0   VARSITY

Coming from behind, after practi-
cally throwing the game away, the
Gold and Blue basebal ltossers tied
the game with West Virginia in the
eighth and, with Langdon holding the
Mountainers safe, ﬁnally won out in
the tenth. The result was in doubt
until the winning run was scored by
Engelhardt sliding safely across the
pan. Throughout the game it seemed
that Pitt did all a team could possibly
do to hand the game to the West Vir-
ginians, but victory could not be de-
nied and ﬁnally perched on the Gold
and Blue banner.

The game, although exciting, was
marked by one of the worst exhibi-
tions of ball playing that a Pitt team
was ever guilty of. There were seven
errors of commission and the number
of errors of omission outnumbered
these. The players would no sooner
show a sample of their true ability,
than they would pull some “bone,”
or muff an easy chance. Peck, at
ﬁrst, led the ﬁeld with ﬁve errors. If
the boys ever heard of inside baseball
they certainly did not show it in the
game Saturday.

The chief offensive feature of the
game was the slugging of “Steve”
Dillon. The old Trojon connected
safely four out of ﬁve chances, two
of these being for extra bases. Mor-
row registered three times, while De-
Hart, Healy and Hart were credited
with two. The hitting of the locals
was all that could be asked, and with
a little sane running of the bases they
might have won_out in the regulation
time. Morrow’s one handed catch of a
hard ﬂy was the ﬁelding sensation of
the day, this catch cutting oﬂ’ several
possible runs.

Hart started the game for the locals
and with any sort of support would
have stowed the game away. How-
ever, the trouble started in the second
when Peck made his ﬁrst error. This,
followed up by Fulton’s double, gaye
West Virginia their ﬁrst run. Again
in the fourth on errors by Peck and
Dillon, another run was scored by the
Snakes. Pitt came back in their half
and tied the count. Dillon opened
with a double, which was promptly
wasted by Matson’s anxiety to score
on an easy inﬁeld tap by Engelhardt.
Morrow singled and Engelhardt scored
on Hart’s single. Morrow, in. turn,
was sent in on DeHart’s hit. Beattie
ended the innning by rolling out.

Again in the sixth the generous Pitt

players handed their opponents 2
runs. Leatherwood opened with a
single. Dille got in the way of one

of Hart’s offerings and there were two
men on and no outs. Fidler hit to De-
Hart and Peck muffed the throw. He
recovered it in time to catch Leather-
wood at home, but Beattie had the
fever, he too, dropped the ball. Ful-
ton then gave Morrow a chance to
distinguish himself, by sending a long
Dill scored

a single sending Fiddler to third.
Ayers was out on an attempted steal.
Dougher walked, but E. Morrow ended
the agony by rolling out to DeHart.
In the same inning Pitt registered
one and it looked as if they would
tie the score, but the timely hit was
not there. However,‘ in the eighth
they succeeded in tying the count on
Morrow’s single, Langdon’s out and
DeHart’s single. In this inning the
stocky third baseman stole second,
third, and came within an inch of
stealing home. Langdon pitched the
last four innings and gave a ﬁne ex-
hibition of twirling. In the tenth with
one down and second and third popu-
lated he struck out the next two men.

The game was won in the tenth.
Dillon opened with his fourth hit of
the day. Gray ran for him, but was-
out on attempted sacriﬁce by Engle-
hardt. Morrow hit safely, advancing
“Gus” to second. Both moved up on
Leatherwood’s -fumble of Langdon’s
inﬁeld tap. With only one out Fiddler
missed a wild one and Englehardt
scored the winning run.

LOOKING ’EM OVER

Well, who is the fastest: Burwell
in a track suit, DeHart in a baseball
uniform, “Andy” Hastings on the
basketball ﬂoor, or Wylie Swope in
the wet water?

Come on think of it, Burwell hasn't
yet, in his two years of running for
Pitt, ﬁnished worse than ﬁrst in any
race he has entered, except.perhaps
a handicap event. This applies to re-
lays in which he was the ﬁrst runner,
as well as to other events. Which,
as a record, isn’t nearly halfbad.

 

Jvust at the present time Hans Wag-
ner is no better than second in the
race for recognition as Carnegie’s
most prominent citizen. Since last
Saturday’s performance “Jim” Mor-
row has the German relic beaten out
by a few yards. That sixth-inning,
one-handed stab of Morrow’s will keep
its grip on our memory for many
years to come.

“Jock” Sutherland would have turn-
ed green with envy, could he have
seen Peck and Dillon throwing the
pill around in the fourth frame. We
didn’t know what the record for the
standing heave is, but Bob and Steve
both smashed it last Saturday. - ’

Evidently the best way to insure
much hitting on the part of Dillon is
to assure him that he can’t swat. Be-
ing relegated from fourth to sixth
position in the batting order doesn’t
appeal to Phil any more than defeat
does to “Pink” Healy.

Bob Peck, last Saturday, forgot all
he ever knew about halchaseing. The
gentleman from Lock Haven had
about as much chance to hold a throw
as the Austrian army has to win a
battle. . V

“Red” McDonald formerly of Pitt
Hays, he of Crafton and the School
of Medicine, and holder of the third
cushion in 1914. Despite the rigors
of a medical course, “Johnny” is tak-
ing time to practice with the base-
ball team, not for the sake of making
a regular job, but moved merely by
the desire to help out if he should be
needed later. From henceforth for-
ever John has our vote.

“Red” McDonald formely, of Pitt
and more recently of Syracuse, is
persona gratissima with the members
of the track team who made the trip
to the Salt City last week. “Red”
took the party under his wing
throughout their stay
and for two days made a noise like
the best reception committee on earth.
At that, he had only a slight lead on
the average Syracusan, if the track
men are to be believed.

Even so, we can’t sympathize with
Fulton, West Virginia's huurler, be-
cause his support handed the battle
to the Varsity in the tenth inning of
that well-known encounter. Leather-
wood, Hersey, Dille, Morrow—all
making the tussel go into extra
these gentlemen ﬁgured largely in
innings, by making stops all over this
end of Allegheny County.

This isn’t very kind, but it’s true,
and you ought to know it; so we tell
it.

It would seem that in one of the
Syracuse papers, published last Satur-
day evening, appeared a photograph
of the ﬁnish of the two-mile classic
between Haskins and Livermore, show-
ing Pitt’s representative pulling in
shoulder to shoulder with the Syra-
cuse star. On the way to Buffalo that
evening “Liver” made the acquaint-
ance of a young lady with whom he
struck up conversation. During a lull,
Pitt’s two-miler took advantage of
the opportunity to pull a newspaper
out of his pocket, in which he became
deeply interested. The desired re-
sponse came quickly. “How much
that looks like you!” said the fair
charmer. With this opening, “Liver”
plunged boldly in, and explained at
length all about the race, how he felt,
how close the ﬁnish was, and the rest.
“Liver” was just on the point of tell-
ing how he was good for at least ten
miles more, when the train pulled into
Buffalo, and Kerr pulled him out of
the car. '

The advance dope on next year's
basketball schedule listens about the
best that Pitt has had for several
years. A schedule which will do just-
ice to the quality of the team which
Pitt should have next year is being
arranged by the athletic authorities.
S. D. Flinn, student manager, has al-
ready made arrangements for about
ﬁfteen games. The regular two-
game series with Penn State, W. &
J., and Tech will be played on the
eastern trip, games will be played
with Lehigh, Lafayette, Swarthmore
and the Army. Of these Lehigh, Laf-
ayette and Swarthmore will also be
met on the home ﬂoor. These teams
are the new league, which includes
three teams in the eastern and three
teams in the western part of the state.

Juniata will open the season here,
and Allegheny will be met later in the
season. Negotiations with several
large eastern teams and with one or
two of the tea-ms in the Western Con-
ference may result in a couple of big
home games. Pitt’s remarkable rec-
ord on the basketball ﬂoor this past
year has given old Uni a reputation
all over the country. The record set
by the team during the past season
1S one that may stand for some time,
but it is the hope of the new captain
and manager to beat this record. Wins
over the Army and Allegheny would
be tsespecially sweet to the Pitt stud-

TENNIS TEAM
GOES ON TRIP
THIS WEEK

The eliminationsifor positions ,on
the tennis team has narrowed down
to ﬁve men. These are Gaut, McEll-
roy, Ebe and Wilbert, veterans, and
a _new man, Evans.
tions ,will be made by advisor Sey-
mour the latter part of the week.
Monday the team leaves on their east-
ern trip where they meet some of the
strongest teams in the East. The trip
this year lincludes games with the
Navy, Georgetown, Princeton and the
University of Pennsylvania. On the
trip last year the Varsity team won
over Pennsylvania, tied Yale, and lost
by close scoresto Harvard and Prince-
ton.

The material for the team both this
year and last has been of the highest
calibre. The record the team made
last year is one to be proud of, and
the prospects for a good record this
year the just as bright. All the men
on the team have had experience in
tournaments in this section and sever-
al have engaged in intercollegiate
contests.

Matches will be played with the
University of Michigan and with Syr-
acuse soon after their return from
the East. Penn State will be met at
State College. Later matches will be
played with both Tech and with W.
& J . here. This is one of the most at-
tractive schedules the tennis team has
ever attempted. The interest in this
sport has been increasing and Uni-
versity courts are the next thing
needed.

Encouraged by their win over Pitts-

are optimistic over their chances in
the remaining games. Today they
will stack up against the strong nine
that represents East Liberty Academy
and Saturday they will meet Beaver
high school. E. L. A. has been win-
ning most of its games this year and
is expected to make the Pitt boys
hustle if they are to bring home the
bacon. Beaver should prove to be an

and slow track the Pitt outdoor team

OHANOES BRIGHT ma
MEET wnn WASH-JEFF

The ill health of , Captain Scott
makes it impossible for that star of
the hurdles to enter the arena this
year, and under this disadvantage
Pitt’s team must work harder.
Undismayed by this handicap, Coach
Kerr is hard at work developing other
men for the fence-jumping events.
Both Fry and Herron are showing
good form, and the Red and Black co-

was blanketed by the Syracuse ‘men
in the contest of Saturday by a score
of 83-42. The Syracuse ﬁeld was in
more than ordinary bad condition and
in the face of this additional handi-

doubling the score on the Blue and
Gold adherents.

Burwell, Sheehan, Fry,'Sutherland
,and Livermore ﬁgured in the big
events of the day. Burwell scored ten
of the points recorded by Pitt, which
he accomplished through the medium
of ﬁrst place in each of the sprints.
Sheehan also annexed ten counters by
landing ﬂush in the running highand
broad jumps. Fry hooked onto seven
points by taking the honor position in
the shot put as well as securing places
in the low hurdle and the discus throw.
Sutherland proved his merit with the
discus when he hurled the oval to the
distance of 124 ft. 8 in. and in so do-
ing established a new University
record.

In the sensational two mile run,
which was the real feature of the day,
Livermore led the Syracuse man,
Haskins, until well up to the end,
when he gave way to his opponent.
The Pitt runner recovered his distance
however and ﬁnished a scant whisper
behind the New Yorker. Lou Mc-
Master came through with his usual
dependability, while Shapira missed
the second notch in the hammer throw
by a mere hair.

This is the ﬁrst time the Pittmen
have- met the Syracuse representa-
tives in any athletic event. All the
members of the squad report that
they were accorded every courtesy
that could have been oifered tothem
by any institution in the country.

The Freshman team scored their
ﬁrst win of the season on Monday
afternoon when they triumphed over
the baseball delegation of the Pitts-
burgh Academy by the one sided
score of 10-2. The ﬁrst-year men

 

never had a look in. _

Capt.‘ Carlson’s aggregation started
the festivities in the '1l‘lll31al round
when they loosed two runs following a
brace of hits, one of which was a
pretty double 'by McMurray. From
that time on it was a merry-go-round
for the Pitt men and there was no
single inning when they failed to reg-
ister. Lewis, who pitched for the
Academy crowd, presented nothing
puzzling to A-mmons’_ _cl_iarges,- and
they walloped the visiting rubber-
gracer for a total of sixteen blows,
ﬁve of which were for extra ‘bases.
*‘ Black commenced the ga_me_in the
box for Pitt and for seven innings he
held down the aggression of the_P. A.
crowd, allowing them but one hit and
a run which was scored on the errors
of his supporters. At the beginning
of the seventh Dewalt took the twirl-
er’s position. During his ﬁrst inning
the visitors reached him for __three hits
which netted them another run, but
afterward he tightened and held_them
scoreless.

HERRICK STARS IN *
ELEVEN INNING TIE.

By playing errorless ball through
eleven grilling innings the Pitt Fresh-
man team last Saturday held the In-
diana Normalites to a scoreless tie on
their home diamond. The Pitt"bats—
men were unable to touch Herrick for
more than one hit, but they fielded
like ﬁends behind the wily Kennedy
and succeeded in discounting the ﬁve
bingles secured by the Indianas.
Herrick played the whole game for
the Indiana team. He had seventeen
men retire before him by the strike-
out route and held the opposition to
on scratch hit. The ﬁve hits unhook-
ed by the Normalites were secured at
such widely separated intervals that
they were unable to push a man across
the home corner.

Forney secured the only safe hit
registered by the Pitt aggregation
during the game. This was in the
seventh, when it looked for a time as
though Herrick might be weakening;
but the Indiana hurler tightened and
retired the next succeeding batsmen.

ALVIN.

Following a run for an entire sea-
son at the Casino Theatre, New York,
Arthur Hammerstein’s production of
“High Jinks” will return" to the Alvin
week of May .10 with regular Wed-
nesday and Saturday matinees.

_The piece is described as a musical
jollity andis the work of Otto Hauer-
bach and Rudolf Friml, who are best
known as the authors of “Naughty
Marietta” and “The Firefly.” The
cast which will present “High Jinks”
is practically the same as that which
was seen at the Casino and seen here
on a former visit.

DAVIS.

 

The play to be given at the Davis
Theatre the week beginning May _10
will be “A Celebrated Case,” which
will be one of the most pretentious
productions so far offered by Mr. Da-
vis’s company.

This play is looked upon in dramatic
circles as somewhat of a classic. Re-
néwed interest in the play as been
taken on lately in consequence of its
revival at the Empire Theatre, New
York, by Charles Frohman and David
Belasco. These gentlemen have drawn
together some ofthe best known stars
in the country, such as Otis Skinner,
Nat Goodwin and others of their rank
in the presentation of the play.

GRAND.

 

Nazimova’s deferred engagement in
“War_ Brides” at the Grand Opera
House will take place beginning Mom-'
day afternoon, May 10. All arrange-
ments have been completed for this
very important week and nothing
short of providential interference will
prevent the famous actress from ful-
ﬁlling her appointment. She is to play
“War Brides" every {afternoon and
evening for one week in a bill which
will consist, in addition to this con-
tribution from the legitimate stage,
of a group of vwudeville attractions
of the highest class.

DANIEL CARHART.

Among the men who stand pre-emi-
nent among the founders and early di-
recting hands of those small begin-
nings from which the present Univer-
sity was destined to grow, the name of
Daniel Carhart will ever be remem-
bered as the founder of the engineer-
ing department of what was then the
Western University of Pennsylvania.
Although at ﬁrst the new venture con-
sisted in a course in civil engineering
under the collegiate department, the
additional departments of mechancial
and electrical engineering were soon
added, and the new department was
then organized as a separate school.
Daniel Carhart was born in Clinton,

New Jersey, on January 28, 1839. His
early life was spent on a farm, and
his early education secured in a coun-
try school. After a preparatory
course in boarding school, he entered
the Polytechnic Institute at Troy, N.
Y., where he remained for a couple of

 

years. Subesquently he graduated
from the Polytechnic College of Penn-
sylvania, taking the degree of C. E.
in 1859, and that of M. C. E. (master
of civil engineering) ‘in 1869. ‘During
the period between these two degrees,
he was practicing as a civil engineer,
being employed in the West, both in
railroad work and land surveying.
For, the next ten years, he served his
Alma Mater as assistant-professor
and professor of civil engineering.

In 1862, Prof. Carhart was brought
to the Western University to found
there an engineering‘ department.
While here, he ﬁrst held the position
of Professor of mathematics “and civil
engineering. From 1892 to 1908, he
was dean of the engineering and coll-
egiate departments of the University,

 

IATPITTTP,

receiving the degree of Se. D. in 1897.
For a short time in the interregnum
between the retirement of Dr. Bra-
shear and the coming of Chancellor
McCormick to the University, Dr.

‘Carhart acted as Chancellor, passing

through one commencement in’ that
capacity. In 1908, he was made emer-
itus professor of civil engineering and
retired from active work. Since that
time, he has kept up his studies and
writings. In 1913, he was made a
member of the board of examiners for
the civil service examinations of the
Interstate Commerce Commission. He
is the author of atextbook on “Plane

gineers,” and is one of the authors
and contributors of the Century En-
cyclopedia. For a long period, Dr.
Carhart was the secretary of the local
Engineers’ Society of Western Penn-
sylvania and was also connected with
the Society for the Promotion of En-
gineering Education.
While Dr. Carhart’s greatest work
for the University has probably been
theifounding and organizing of the en-
gineering department, many of the
old graduates remember his remark-
able ability of coupling ﬁrst class in-
struction with a manner pleasing and
very easy to understand. “Uncle
Dan,” as he was affectionately styled,
was also a wonderful mathematician,
working out in his head problems
which the student labored on for many
minutes, or telling the student who
covered the side of the board, that he
ougt to work it out on the “back of a
postage stamp.” He was very sin-'
cere and earnest in all his work and
took great pride in the productions of
his department. Although he was
gruff in manner, he was very kind-
hearted when one came to know him
and there was never any formality in
the relations with “Uncle Dan.”

Since his retirement, Dr. Carhart
works among his books and on his
place. He points withpride to the
ﬁne loving cup and the chair present-
ed to him by the students and faculty
respectively at the time of his retire-
ment.

honor guest at the reunion at com-
mencement this year.

TECH AND STATE TO BE
MET ON SAME AFTERNOON.

A big afternoon is on the books for
Pitt fans on the afternoon of Satur-
day, May 15th. With a track meet
and .a baseball game scheduled for
Forbes Field that day, all for the
beneﬁt of University students,_ the
heart of the bargain-hunter will be
made glad.

At one o’clock the big show will
open. with the ﬁrst event of the dual
track and ﬁeld meet with Carnegie
Tech. , This will .continue until three
or three thirty, being immediately fol-

»lowed by the diamond contest with

Penn State. When ‘this is over the

  I-'|l_ESHMAN BASKETBALL

. TEAMS HAVE FEAST

Last Thursday evening Trees Gym
was the scene of a gay assemblage
when the members and friends of the
boys and girls Freshmen basketball
teams gathered to celebrate the suc-
cess of the seasons just ﬁnished.

Twenty-six of the team_ members
including Director Miller, Coach Lan-
dis, Mr. and Mrs. Provin, and Mr. and
Mrs. France asembled to pay tribute
to these singularly successful athletic
seasons and incidently to reinforce
themselves with the bountiful spread
of tasty viands that had been pro-
vided not by accident.

With the supper disposed of as suc-
cessfully and easily as had been all
the opponents of the year, Director C.
S. Miller, acting as toastmaster called
upon -and was responded to by all
those present.

Coach Landis, in remembrance of
his excellent service to the team, was
presented with a gold football suitable
engraved.» The numerals were then
presented by C. S. Miller and the ban-
quet closed as successfully as had the
seasons of the respective teams.

The center of the 1918 .basketball
team raises a point of personal privil-
‘ego, claiming that his nameis Nicol-
as, not Nicholas with an “h,” like
Pittsburgh. We have entered into a
solemn compact to spell the.namevcor-

s shootinsﬁeye.

  

the biggest and best affair of the year
are being worked out. This banquet
will be open to all the University
crowd and the students, especially the
members of the Senior class are
doubly welcome. Following the cus-
tom in the past, members of the Sen-
ior class who attend this banquet are
granted free me-mbership in the Gen-
eral -Alumni association until Janu-
ary 1, 1916. A system for getting
every member of the Senior class of
all schools is being devised.

Watch the WEEKLY for full de-
tails.

ATHLETIC EVENTS AT
COMMENCEMENT TIME.

 

There has been some confusion due
to the publication of a newspaper
article stating that the varsity base-
ball game here with Washington &
Jefferson College will be played Com-
,mencement, Day, Wednesday, - June
16th. The W & J. ball games are
scheduled as follows: A .

At Trees Stadium, Saturday, June
12th.

At Washington, Tuesday, June 15th.

On Commencement Day, Wednes-
day, June 16th, a game will be played
between the Varsity and the Alumni
team on the stadium, “Bobby” Grove,
former Varsity Manager, having
charge of the Alumni team. He has
a bunch of former Pitt baseball stars
and says he will give Capt. Healy’s
nine a real game. Among those who
are expected to play are Dr. Thun-
hurst, Dr. Quailey,_ Dr. Duff, Dr’. Budd,
Dr. Ralston, Dr. Wymard, “Boots”
Koenig, “Walt” Allen. and others. An
effort was made to have the Com-
mencement Day game scheduled here
with W. & J. but this was found im-
possible. The Alumni game was the
next best thing. \

Many of the members of classes
scheduled for reunions here Alumni
Day, Tuesday, June 15th, will prob-
ably gq to Washington to see the W.
& J. game. If they are ardent lovers
of the National game but don't want
to go away,.they can go to Forbes
ﬁeld and see the Pirates play, as
Captain Fred Clarke's team is home
that day.

of the Council if elected. His activ-
ities in connection with the $3,000,0_0

WILL YOU WRITE US A LETTER?

 

The Alumni Secretary once again
wishes to arise and remark that let-
ters from the Alumni that can be
published in the Alumni columns. of
THE_ WEEKLY are much desired,
especially from the men who are lo-
cated at great distances from Alma
‘Mater. The letters from E. L. Esta-
brook '13, from China, printed last
week, and this week’s letter from Ray-
mond L. Archer ’11, who has been
stationed as a Missionary at Buiten-
zorg, Java, are very interesting to
their classmates and to the Alumni,
generally. We have a number of
other Alumni who are located in for-
eign lands and we would like to have
similar letters from them.

It is really remarkable how the
sons of old Pitt scatter after they
complete their courses and face the
world of opportunity and hard knocks.
Even the recent graduates are in-
cluded among this list. Of course, the
larger precentage of them located in

In California, Washington, New

and other states the Pitt men are lo-
cated. And we are glad to state that
distance doesn’t seem to make them
forget the Old School. Many of them
are members of the General Alumni
Association_ and get THE WEEKLY,
which keeps them in close touch with
affairs here. Several have written that
the paper is a regular “letter from

MEETING.

 

(Continued from Page ll

 

On Sunday «morning a short session
was taken up by a question box and
talk by Mr. Elliott. He spoke of the
present task of the Christian college
studentand used the story of Gideon
to illustrate how one can do it with
God’s help.

In the afternoon Mr. Micou spoke
on “Life Work Guidance.” He em-
phasized the altruistic nature of a life
work. He advised that many callings
be earnestly considered and that,
when one was found, to follow it with
a whole heart. He passed cards to
the delegates and asked that they
make a personal and private pledge
and then set out to fulﬁll the con-
ditions of the pledge. The last and
one of the best talks- was by Mr. Ed-
wards who chose as his theme “Doing
the King’s Service in the King’s Spir-
it.” He said that all work to be done
well must necessarily call" for honest
sacriﬁce. After a short address by

i- Chancellor'McCormick the delegates

spoke words of farewell and appreci-
ation for the hospitality of the local
Y. M. C. A. I .

The conference was closed by the
singing of “Blest'Be the Tie that

* Binds” as the delegates joined hands

about the room.. Sorne delegates left
