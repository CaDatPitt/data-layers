“We are anxious to have as many
people participate in the program as
possible,” Viehman stated, “but we
would like to emphasize that mem-

Excerpts rom Report,
Chancellor’ s Answer

 I ntroduction---trustees:

The following are esccerpts taken from the investi-
gat£ng"committee’s 49-page« report and from the Chan-
cellor’s 19-page reply as released at last m'ght’s meet-
ing:

On March 20, 1939, the Board of Trustees of the
University of Pittsburgh appointed, at the request of
Chancellor“ Bowman, the undersigned trustees as a
special committee “to study the situation at the Uni-
versity in all of its phases and to report to the Board as
early as possible.”

The committee began its work without delay, on
March 21. Since that time 18 meetings, totaling more
than 47 hours, have been given to interviewing 43 of the
University’s officers of general administration, deans,
professors and instructors, and representatives of stu-
dent organizations and alumni groups. A

The committee believes that these 43 persons con-
stitute a representative cross-section of the University’s
family and that they have given the committee reliable
information respecting the situation at the University
in all of its phases. The committee’s record of this
information covers more than 400 typewritten pages.

The committee had not gone far with its work before
it realized that the current situation at the University
is to be seen in its proper perspective only when it is
viewed in relation to developments at the University
during the past 18 or 20 years.

Accordingly, the committee has used a 20-year
period as its “frame of reference” and has attempted to
make an unbiased review of events of that period to
account for conditions currently prevailing in the Uni-
versity and to reach conclusions as a basis for recom-
mendations.

 =‘r'.=

I ntroduction---chancellor:

At a meeting of the Trustees, on September 15, I
learned, for the ﬁrst time, the content of the report of
your Committee of Investigation. The Committee spent
six months on its report. During this period I was
consulted in no way about the matter.

Much of the report tells that the administration of
the University is less than adequate. If this were all,
I should make no reply. It interests me, however, that
I could have given your Committee more convincing
evidence to the point than is in the report. Other parts
of the report, however, do harm to the University. To
some of these I reply.

John’

Judgments are made in the report sometimes on:

little or no data. If more information had been at
hand, some of the conclusions, I think, would have had
a different color. Good as the intent is, the effect is to
hurt the University, both in Pittsburgh and over the
country.

I am at a loss to understand the tone of the language
of the report, although I am sure that the Committee
as a whole is loyal to the University.

Press Relations---trustees:

The committee found that the University of Pitts-
burgh’s relations with the public press of the city are
far from satisfactory. Although the charge is made in
some quarters that the University gets a “bad press”
because the Pittsburgh papers are prejudiced against it,
the committee could ﬁnd no evidence to justify its
sharing that opinion. I V B B ,

Rather, it appeared to the committeethat the man-
ner in which the University sometimes manages its at-
fairs accounts, as much as anything else, for the type
of publicity which results.

Moreover, the University’s Administration appears
not sutliciently to realize the importance of giving the
press full measure of cooperation in reporting the Uni,-

versity’s news. 

The committee has already pointed out that the Di-
rector of the University’s News Service is not always:
kept adequately informed about the University’s events:
and the policies, decisions and actions of the Admin»
istration.

Sometimes the papers get stories on these matters‘
from other sources before he hears of them. When re-
porters then come to him for additional information,
he is unequipped to help them and they, in turn, feel
free to interview all persons who may have any infor-
mation on the subject.

On many such occasions the reporters have been
given conﬂicting statements by various persons in the
University, with the result that the news is not always
printed in a way to put the University in the best light.

Press Relations---chancellor:

The other sections of the report I shall leave un-
answered, not that they can not be answered. Time
is short.

In passing, however, I note that the report says that
the University’s relations with the press are “far from
satisfactory.” I ought to answer that. What the re-
port says on this subject is important and true. Neither
do I blame the press as “prejudiced.” Much of the pub-
licity about the University has a habit of wanting
myself in it. Good or bad, I prefer to be out of it. I
am the one who is prejudiced. That is just a natural
‘fact. No explanation for it is known and a cure is
doubtful. But the report is right. I herewith agree as
best I can, with the help of Robert X. Graham and
Frank Carver, to try to improve our relations with the
press. I should much value suggestions from the down-
town newspaper men themselves on this matter. I
[should like to ask, too, for a bit of special and kindly
{consideration at the start because of a probably-in-
, curable lack of joy at being in the news.
§ L1,brartes---trustees:

i The Committee found that the University of Pitts-
iburgh’s Administration has, for whatever reason, not
‘succeeded in developing the University’s library to the
,point required by the size of the institution and the
iscope of its educational interests.

, For the present academic year the library budget is
Qless than $70,000. About $50,000 of this amount is for
tsalaries and only $20,000 is available for the purchase
of books, binding, and supplies incident to the operation-
of the library.

It is evident at once that under this budget the Uni-
versity is making nothing more than a gesture toward
keeping up with the essential publications, to say noth-
ing of overcoming the library’s notorious deﬁcit in
books.

An authoritative study by a member of Stanford
University showed. that as late as the academic year
1935-36 the University of Pittsburgh’s library listed only
178,595 titles, while the University of Pennsylvania
listed 840,495. Moreover, the University of Pennsyl-
vania was adding to its library at a more rapid rate than
was Pittsburgh.

Excerpts From Report,
C haucellor’ s Answer

Continued from Page One

Libraries--chancellor:

When I came to the University, then, there were,
the Librarian reported, 46,000‘ volumes in the Library-
About 15,000 of these books were still in packing boxes
in the attic of State Hall. They were put there When
the University was moved from the N0!'th Sid9- We
had no cases for them or room for additional cases.
The‘Library had hope, but not much else. '

(Dr. Bowman cited speciﬁc improvements in the

' laboratory facilities for the departments Of bi010gY,

chemistry, physics, geology, school of Engineering,
schol of dentistry, school of medicine, ceramics, seis-
mology, and retail training).

The number of books now in the Library is 357,816
-—almost eight times as many as in 1920, counting the
books in the attic. The increase for the present year
was 28,027. The Library has expanded its floor space
from 5263 square feet in 1921 in State Hall to 40,403
square feet in 1939 in the Cathedral of Learning. The
present space used by the Library would ﬁll com-
pletely two ‘ buildings the size of Alumni Hall. Ex-
clusive of the building structure, the cost of ﬁnishing,
furnishing, and equipping this Library in the Cathedral
of Learning was $277,497. .The value of the books was
estimated in 1920 at $92,000 and in 1939 at $1,123,000.

Just a word now about the use of the Library, for
the use of books is as pertinent to this review as the
number of books. In 1933-34 the recorded attendance
of users of the Library was 188,724; in 1938-39, after the
new library quarters were opened, the number was
384,504, an increase of 104% during the past ﬁve years.

The circulation of books has increased in almost the»
same proportion. In 1933-34 the -circulation of books
was 114,804; in 1938-39 the circulation was 230,723, an
increase of 101%.

All the facts here given were easily to be had for
the asking. -

With these facts, let me ask the speciﬁc point of the
criticism contained in the report that “the committee
found that the University of Pittsburgh’s Administra-
tion had, for whatever reason, not succeeded in devel-
oping the University’s library to the point required by
the size of the institution and the scope of its educa-
tional interests.” Let me ask:

How much under-developed is the Library today
compared with what you think is reasonable to expect?

0
Laboratories---trustees:

I In the matter of laboratories, the University shows
an uneven situation. The laboratories in some depart-
ments are probably fairlyiadequate; in others they are
obviously inadequate, at least in comparison with those
of standard universities.

Chemistry and physics are below standard in space
and equipment; both departments urgently need atten-
tion. The committee is pleased to report it has been
advised that the Administration plans to provide an
improved set-up in Alumni Hall for the Department of
Chemistry and that the Thaw Hall space of this De-
partment which is thus relaesed will be used to im-
prove the accommodations of the Physics Department.

Luborutories---chancellor:

Aside from the annual appropriation to the various
departments for books and supplies and aside from the
cost of new building construction, $341,000 have been
spent for the improvement, equipment, and furnishing
of laboratories during the past ﬁve years.

No mention of this phase of the laboratories is in
the report; nor a word of encouragement——a word, for
example, for Jennings, Silverman, Hutchisson, or Sher-
rill, to mention only a few. No mention is made of
the quality of the research, especially of the work of
King, Hooker, Stegeman, and Gray, supported by spe-
cial appropriations from The Buhl Foundation and
from the University and from others. No mention is
made of the work of Dr. Hazlett in the Department of
Industrial Hygiene, in partial support of which the
Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company con-
tributed $50,000. The plain fact is that much of the
teaching and of the research. being carried on in these
departments ranks at the top level of such work in the
world.

Student Facilities---trustees:

For instance, the report comments as follows: “Not-
withstanding the University of Pittsburgh’s extensive
building program, little attention has been given to
providing such physical conveniences for its students.
The available facilities are pitifully short. The Com-
mons Room of the Cathedral of Learning may be an
effort in that direction, but the committee learned that
student use of that room is rather restricted to acca-
sions that beﬁt its cathedral-like grandeur. There is
nothing of the ‘student-union’ about the atmosphere of
the Commons Room and, in the judgment of the stu-
dents, it fails to meet their needs for a center, or
‘union’ like those provided by other leading institu-
tions.”

Student F acilities---chancellor:

The statement with the words “cathedral-like
grandeur” indicates but little comprehension as to the
value of the room. None of us think that the Commons
Room is in any way part. of a -student union idea.

tive report.

 

The Pitt News

every list of needs of the University. It has been in-
cluded as a building that would cost $1,200,000.

Why, let me ask, if the report is to discuss the
“Club” facilities, should it not include at least a factu-

, ally complete statement?

(Dr. Bowman pointed out that space in use for stu-
dent needs includes the eighth, 12th, and 28th ﬂoors, of
the Cathedral, Falk Clinic (men’s student health serv-
ice), Heinz House, Cathedral smoking rooms, Commons
Room, dental inﬁrmary, cafeteria, Foster Memorial, and
the Women's gymnasium.)

Academic Ideals---trustees:

The standards which are set for the admission of
students and the requirements students must meet to
remain in the school and be advanced toward gradua-
tion determine, in a large measure, the‘ standing"-of a
university among its sister institutions. I

ters is not as good as that in the best institutions, nor
is it as bad as that in the worst, The committee is
pleased to report, however, that the University’s Ad-
ministration has recently been giving attention to this
problem and has been ‘gradually raising the entrance
requirements. ‘

The requirements a student must meet to remain in
the University is another phase of this problem of
standards. The committee found that some members of
the faculty make the criticism that students dropped
from their particular schools as unqualiﬁed are some-
times permitted by the University’s administrative au-
thorities to register in other divisions of the University.

It must be recognized that a student may fail in one
ﬁeld of learning and be quite qualiﬁed to do a“ more
competent job in another ﬁeld better adapted to his inter-
ests and talents, but from the institutional point of View
it is important that such transfers be made with an eye
to institutional standards. A

Academic Ideals---chancellor:

Let me conﬁne myself here to a brief statement:

University. In 1926 only 58.4% of the freshmen ranked
in the upper 50% of their respective high school gradu-
ating classes, while in 1939, 84.5% of the freshmen
ranked in the upper 50% of their respective high school
graduating classes.

(2) In a test of the freshmen in 355 institutions
under the auspices of the American Council on Educa-
tion, there were nineteen institutions having 500 to
2000 freshmen. In this group the University of Pitts-
burgh freshmen ranked fourth. In the larger group,
including the smaller colleges, the University was in-
cluded in theupper ﬁfth. "

(3) The University departments are fully accredited
by every recognized academic accrediting agency and
in cases where ratings are made, as in the case of Medi-
cine, Law, and Dentistry, the University divisions have
class “A” rating. .

The above are the tangible data. They have all in

Tenure---trustees:

The University’s failure officially to recognize a code
of tenure was noted by the Committee of the Legislature
of the Commonwealth when it investigated the Univer-
sity a few years ago. Shortly thereafter the University’s
Administration appointed a committee of the faculty to
study the question and to make recommendations.

This committee, the evidence indicates, gave its
work earnest and long attention and made an exhaus-
However, neither the committee nor the
faculty has ever received word as to what, if any
action was taken on the report.

This circumstance has been construed by some in
the faculty as evidence that the Administration chose
the silence of a pocket-veto as a way of discouraging
faculty interest in a code. Others, more critical, have
held that the incident illustrated a tendency toward
arbitrary action. ‘

The absence of official recognition of a code of ten-
ure by the University of Pittsburgh appears deﬁnitely
to hurt the University’s reputation at other universities.
Absence of a code was a chief factor in putting the
University on the blacklist of the American Association
of University Professors. Many members of the4Uni-

‘ versity’s faculty are sensitive about the University of
Pittsburgh’s being one of the two colleges currently on

this blacklist.

The University’s failure to give official recognition
to a. code of tenure is difficult to understand in view of
the fact that in actual practice the University observes
the tenure principle to a substantial extent.

T enure---chancellor:

The report records in support of this recommenda-
tion seven pages of ready-made arguments on one side
of the issue. I want to be open-minded and fair; I
want to see all of the good in the subject. I know of in-
stitutions, however, which have adopted such codes to
their regret.

American Colleges has been working for some time on
a revised code. This revised code failed to be ratiﬁed
at the January meeting, 1939, of the Association.

Conclusion---chancellor:

For 39 years I have worked in education, most of
those years in administration. The best of my life has
gone into the University.

I hope yet to accomplish the three objects which
you and I started nineteen years ago. The ﬁrst is to
finish the interior of the high building; the second is
better teaching, which requires patience, encourage-
ment, and more money; and the third is to construct
two laboratories for the Medical Center at a cost of
about $1,900,000.

Such projects are most difficult under the best of
conditions. But when athletics, the faculty, the stu-
dents, the newspapers, alumni clubs, the legislature in
Harrisburg, and now the board of trustees itself are
,kept in a state of agitation by a small group of alumni,
progress is impossible. Time will make all of this,- with
its motives, clear. In the meantime and as always the
target for fault-ﬁnding and for disdain is broad. To
think well of ourselves and to lay a foundation for
headway are matters easily destroyed.

Chancellor Leaves Part

Of Report Unanswered

Administrative “Bottleneck” '

But when the committee turned its attention to the
organizational set-up of the Adgministration and its
policies’? and methods of management, some signiﬁ-cant
weaknesses were revealed:

In .set-up,...ihe Administration ‘of the University is
not, in the committee’s judgment, well organized. The
officers whoare charged with the over-all administra-
tion of the institution do not function along lines of
clearfy deﬁned responsibility and authority. The same
function is ofttimes divided. haphazardly among several
officers, and a single oﬁicer’s roster of duties may com-
prise an almost impossible heterogeneity.

One of the most noticeable results of this confusion
in organization is an excessively heavy concentration
of administrative work in the hands of one man, the
Business Manager and Secretary of the University. A
review of his duties convinced the commitee that he has
an overload which affects the University’s work ad-
versely in more than one respect.

In the ﬁrst place, an excessive amount of the Uni-
-versity’s heavy volume of administrative work is forced
.-into a bottleneck in his oﬁice; decisions and actions are
greatly impeded and are sometimes so delayed that
questions which are of normal magnitude when they
«first arise sometimes become, before they get attention,
problems and issues which are abnormally difficult of
solution.

Inlthe second place, the variety of the work con-
centrated in the hands of this one man calls for a ver-
satility of talents not often possessed by a single person.

In the third place, the very pressure of his volume
of duties is so heavy that it constitutes a barrier against
his taking the time to consult the advise of those whose
«official interests are affected by his decisions and actions.
Dissatisfaction on the part of those thus affected is not,
under these circumstances, difficult to understand.

That the concentration here described has not gone
::unnoticed by the University’s Administration is evi-

denced by the appointment, about 20 months ago, of a
Provost. However, the committee‘ found that there has
never been a clear arrangement of the relationship of
the work of the Provost, on the one hand, to the work
of the Business Manager and Secretary, on the other
hand. ,

The..res.ul't has been confusion; deans and faculty fre-
ouently do not know to- which ofﬁcer they should go
A with their University problems.

These comments are intended to emphasize that in
an institution of the size and scope of the University of
Pittsburgh, haphazard administrative organization ex-
acts a heavy toll. Work is poorly distributed, often de-
layed, and sometimes inexpertly managed.

Fresh Grid Squad

Besides the mental “casualties” in-

  

.curred.in .the.25—0 trouncing by the
Penn State fresh, the Pitt yearlings
brought’ home several physical injur-
ies, as Well, from last S.aturday’s con-
ﬂict.

In addition to assorted cuts, bruises,
andabrasions, several cubs suffered
more serious injuries. Jack Heister,
first-string center, needed three
stitches "for a spike wound in his
hand. Right tackle Johnny Gurczen-
ski left the ﬁeld early in the game
following the aggravation of a leg in-
jury suffered earlier in the year.

Another grid casualty was left end

should be ready for ‘the West Vir-
ginia battle ‘at Morgantown a aweek

However, barring »

  
  
    
   

Consultdtion of Faculty

-The committeefound that there is less than ade-
quate consultation by the University’s chief officers of
administration. In recent years the Administration has
held few meetings of its deans as a group,‘ and the for-
mer University Council has been allowed to pass out of
existence.

Both these developments are regretted by the deans
and the faculties. The result is that the various schools

and their faculties feel that they are allowed “to go
pretty much their own way,” but they also feel that

their work is not given adequate attention and recogni-
tion.

The trend away from consultation with organized
groups in the University has lost for the institution a
unifying force, a sense of responsible partnership which
the individual dean and faculty member would like to
feel for the aﬁairs of the University, and much expert
advice which could be helpful in the guidance of the
University along paths of sound policy.

The combination of _(1) a loose administrative set- '

up, (2) neglect to bring all segments of the institution
into a consultative partnership, and (3), failure to keep

all parties advised of decisions made and actions taken "
is responsible, in the committee’s judgment, for many »

of the difficulties currently besetting the University.

A thle tics

Your committe’s analysis of the athletic situation

led it to the conclusion that the University’s .Adminis- I

tration was justiﬁed in the change of athletic policy it
effected. This change was, in the committee’s judg-
ment, necessary to bring the University of Pittsburgh
into line with established practices at the best institu-
tions. ‘ 

However, it appears that the management of the
transition from the old policy to the new was inept and
that this factor accounts, in large measure, for the ill-
will which has grown up among many of the groups
interested in athletics.

One of the most regrettable results of the contro-
versies which arose o-ut of the athletic situation was
the resignation of Dr. John B. Sutherland as coach of
the University’s football team. The committee feels,
in common with the deans, faculty members, students,
and alumni whom it interviewed, that Dr. Sutherland’s
resignation was a distinct loss to the University.

One other feature of the athletic situation deserves
comment. The University has recently entered into an
arrangement whereby the Commissioner of the Western
Conference will be an unofficial advisor to the Univer-
sity in its efforts to adhere to its new athletic code.

This plan gives the University expert and disinter-
ested advice at a difficult period and should guide the
University in so conducting its athletics that they will
be recognized as of the standard maintained in the
“Big Ten.” It seems to the committee, however, that
the University’s present athletic set—up would be still
more improved if it went beyond this arrangement and
established at the University a code for the conduct of
athletics which is identical in every respect with the
Western Conference’s code.

The University’s present code is a compilation of
extracts from a number of other recognized codes but
it does not completely parallel any one of them. Hence
the University has all the diﬂiculties of administering
a severe “special” code, without any of the advantages
accruing from adherence to a “group” code of recog-
nized standing.

Dr. Baldwin Gives Talk E

On European Condition

Lecturer Discusses Fallacies of Newspaper
Reports in Address Before Inquiry Audience

By Jack Brady
Conditions inside Europe are not what our newspapers would
have us believe, Dr. Leland Baldwin, editor of University Press and
lecturer in history, informed the Inquiry Forum assembly on Monday.
Pointing out’ that “impressions of Germany struck us as being
very diﬂerent from what propaganda would have us believe,” Dr.
Baldwin did not describe political repression of the people, but

(lwelled on their physical condi-
tion. He decared that “they gave
every impression of being pros-
perous.”

He explained that the people were
well dressed, appeared to be happy,
and “at thetime of my visit they had
plenty to eat."

When Dr. and Mrs. Baldwin ate in
the German restaurants they found
people there who had plenty of
money to spend. The only food short-
age appeared to be in butter and
milk.

“Apparently the present regime in
Germany is trying to revive the use
of the old-time costumes, because we
saw many authentic Tyrolean cos-
tumes and the peasants in the ﬁelds
were dressed in brightly—colored cos-
tumes,” he explained.

“Especially was I impressed,” he
saiad, “by the many new towns
springing up over Germany and by
the excellent parallel roaads, which
I believe to be the best in Europe.

“But in Austria the conditions were
decidedly different, even though the
Austrians have the reputation of be-
ing an easy—going people. Austrians

appeared to be very much run down

at the heels, but I do not know
whether this was necessarily due to
the oppression of the Austrians or
not,” he declared.

Traveling through France the im-
pression he received was that the
country was desperately hard up,
“decadent, and the people looked as
though they had tuberculosis.”

“The people,” he continued, “were
poorly dressed, and the houses were
far from "the modern standards, but
worst of all was the extremely poor
conditions of the French roads.”

“The people had a considerable
amount of discipline and appeared to
be alert. The roads are among the
best in Europe and the streets are
extremely clean, but,” continued Dr.
Baldwin, “I do not know how much
of this to lay to the Fascist govern-
ment.”

“Upon arriving in London I was
just in time to note the astonishment
of the ‘Londoners’ in regard to the al-
liance of Germany and Russia in a
non-aggression pact,” said Dr. Bald-
Win, “and they were really aston-
ished.”

“Evacuation of the ‘vacks’ (chil-
dren who were being sent to the
country to eliminate the possibilitity
of their injury in the event of bomb-
ing planes) had already begun, and
children crowded the playgrounds
holding their little knapsacks and
cardboard boxes with gas masks in
them,” he explained.

“Every country re-echoed with the
tramp of marching men, whether
they had any reason to march or not,”
said Dr. Baldwin.

We try ‘~ to discourage this sort of thing,

Incidentally, our suit and coat showing at

$35 has an equal appeal of authority and
reliability to faculty men.
