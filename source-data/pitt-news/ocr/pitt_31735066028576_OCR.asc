to hit first, study says  

Brett Taylor

News Assistant

A study on dating violence con-
ducted by a Pitt psychology profes-
sor shows that female college stu-
dents between the ages of 18 and 22
are more likely to initiate violence
within dating relationships than are
their male college-student partners.

The findings contradict what
people have traditionally believed
about violence in relationships,
namely, that men are the more
aggressive partners.

According to Irene Frieze, the
professor who conducted the study,
the attacks from women occur in
the form of low—intensity pushes,
slaps, threats and thrown objects.

She said these attacks are usual-
ly not taken seriously by either
partner and that the man usually
laughs it off. 0

But Frieze said she wants to
make women aware of the conse-
quences of these attacks.

"The guys are clearly holding

‘back-and will eventually get tired of

it [the attacks]," Frieze explained.

She said she fears men will
become frustrated with the low-
level violence and will eventually
become violent toward the women.
She also"said that this could lead to
higher-level domestic violence in
the future. 0

The study found that men are
more violent than women in only
two areas of behavior.

One was in throwing objects,
which is often equated with releas-
ing pent-up frustration. In the
study, 47 percent of the male sub-
jects were reported to have thrown
objects, while 40 percent of partici-

pants reported Women throwing.

objects. The second was "forced

sex," with 6 percent of male sub-‘

jects and only 1 percent of female

subjects reported to have forcibly

done this.

’ Frieze said she fears the throw-
ing of objects could eventually lead
to hitting or kicking.

Ever since Sharon Blake, senior '

news representative in Pitt's Office
of Communications, issued a news
release on Oct. 6 about this study,

Dressed in dark blazers, red ties,
business suits anddresses, Pitt students
roamed the William Pitt Union’s
Ballroom on Thursday, collecting busi-
ness cards, pens and candy in hopes of

landing their ﬁrst jobs once they’ve‘

graduated.

The scene was part of Opportunities
'97, the third annual job fair sponsored
by Pitt's Placement and Career Services.

As recruiters from over 100 compa-
nies stood at tables displaying the finer
points of their businesses, students
strolled from table to table with their
resumes and wide-eyed ambition look-
ing for a career after they leave Pitt.

"I'm here for a learning experience,"
said student Adam Maynard, while
scouting out the employers in atten-
dance, deciding which companies might

have a need for a person with a degree in .

business and psychology next spring.

   

"I'm here to meet prospective employers,
gain interviewing skills and learn how to
networ ." y

Coming out of the mouths of stu-
dents and recruiters alike, ‘networking’
was the word of the day. The art of meet-
ing employers who could help a student

ing the event.

"I want to see what job opportunities
there are and meet the people who can
make those opportunities happen," said
Anita Pytlarz, a business and communi-
cations major.

According to Barb Juliussen, assis-
tant director of Placement Services, the
job fair was one of the largest the
University has seen. One hour into the
event, Juliussen estimated that 1500 stu-
dents from a variety of majors would
eventually attend. She went on to say
that students arrived early for the event,
which began at 10 a.m., and were anx-
ious yet conﬁdent.

"We've had students come early just
to see where the different employers
would be located. The students are deﬁ-
nitely enthusiastic and very profession-
al," Juliussen said as she manned the reg-
istration table, letting the students enter
the room with either a Pitt 1]) card or
copies of their resumes. '

Juliussen believed that many stu-
dents were ready for this job fair because
they had’ attended seminars on writing
resumes and cover letters as well as
interviewing skills. The Placement
Center also hosted a reception for gradu-

unusual induction tradition

Jennifer Stoltz

Staff Writer

Some students had a valid reason
to look over their shoulders last week.

During the first annual Student
Honor Organizations Tapping Week,
three campus honor societies inducted
new members by tapping them on the
shoulder at an unannouncedtime and

informing them that they were invited

to join.

dition together," said Cavalla. "It's the
first year. The numbers don't bother
me at all. It's the concept that matters."

Prospective members of these
organizations were tapped either
immediately before or after class to
signify their acceptance. In most cases,
applicants to organizations were asked
to include their class schedule as part
of the process. If it was not possible to
tap during or around class time, other

arrangements were made. Some new '

members were tapped in their resi-

sponsored this spe- dence halls, f0f
cial week in hopes of H ' instance. I
. . e said
making it a In most cases,
University tradition. the tapper was an
Karrie Budzinski officer in that organi-

Valauri, OSA assis-
tant director, was the
brain behind the idea
and sent brochures
and letters to the
presidents of every
honor‘. organization
on campus to encour-
age their participa-
tion.

Joe Cavalla, OSA
director and the
adviser of Omicron
Delta Kappa, a
national honorary
and leadership soci-
ety, commented on the execution of
this event. .

"Each organization has their own
methods, [their own] ways of picking
members,” he said. “Tapping Week is
just a way to -let the candidates know
they have been accepted."

The purpose of the tapping is to
signify academic achievement and
individual excellence at the University
by accepting chosen students into Pitt's
honor organizations. It is meant_ to
convey the prestige and honor associ-
ated with becoming a member of these
societies. . _

Another aspect of this event is that
it is done in the presence of the hon-
ored students‘ peers and professors.
The week’s creators also feel that an
event such as this will assist in devel-
oping the allegiance and commitment
of new members to the organizations.

Undergraduate students who have
applied to a recognized University stu-
dent honor organization may be tapped
upon their acceptance. Out of the 18
such organizations, only three were
officially registered as part of this
week-long event.

"We're just trying to put a new tra-

zation.

After tapping
the new inductee on
the shoulder, the tap-
per then officially
notified the honoree
of upcoming formal
inductions or activi-
ties. Tapping is not a
substitute for induc-
tion ceremonies; it is
meant to complement
them. Now that
Tapping Week is offi-
cially over, partici-
pating organizations
will go on with their usual procedures
concerning new members.

For honor societies who don’t
choose new members until the spring,
there is another Tapping Week in the
works, tentatively scheduled for the

_week of January 26. This way, all eli-

gible organizations will have the
opportunity to strengthen this newly
created tradition.

The OSA is responsible for many
of Pitt's long—standing traditions. It is
hoping that, with time, the ﬂedgling
Tapping Week will become one of
these. As quoted from the brochure
sent to the honor organizations, the
OSA wants to more publicly "recog-
nize those students who have strived
and obtained academic excellence."

While the impact of and response
to this week will not be known for a
while, the overall reaction and success
of this new program is expected to be
good.

"These are honor organizations.
It's very prestigious,” said Cavalla.
“These students are being recognized
for their scholarship, leadership and
sense of community. We think people
will be very happy."

Jewish students fast and

Nora O'Neil

For The Pitt News

Yom Kippur, one of the Jewish high
holidays, was celebrated across Pitt's
campus on Friday and Saturday. Students
fasted, attended services and threw
break—the-fast parties when it was all
over.

Yom Kippur occurs 10 days after
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.
Heather Sheridan, Hillel's Steinhardt
Jewish Campus Service Corps senior fel-
low, explained the holiday.

"Yom Kippur is a day of atonement.
It is the day you ask God to forgive you
for your transgressions. The period of
time between the holidays of Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur is designed to

be a time of reﬂection and forgiveness,” .

she said. “If you are truly sorry when you
come to Yom Kippur services, your name
is said to be inscribed in the book of life
for another year. The saying is a
metaphor for God granting you happiness

pray for Yom Kippur

and forgiveness throughout the year."

Yom Kippur lasted from sundown on
Friday until sundown on Saturday.
During this period, Jews were supposed
to fast.

Emily Myers, a junior, said fasting is
a way to remind you about the holiday.

"The fast is not a punishment,’’, she
said. “Fasting is supposed to help you
reflect upon the holiday."

After Saturday’s sundown, however,
the fast is broken, and large break-the—fast
parties are thrown. Marcie Amemick, a
junior, couldn't go home for the holiday
but described how her family traditional-
ly breaks the fast.

"We usually have a lot of dairy prod- I

ucts. Bagels and lox are the main food,”
she explained. “It's quite a celebration."

Hillel offered a break-the—fast party
following the services that took place on
Saturday. ’

"Being able to go to Hillel helps me
feel more connected to my Judaism when
I can't be around my family,” said Myers.

 

Every member of   Congress
receives a raise from Clinton

Across the Nation

WHITE HOUSE — Members of
Congress can now expect a bigger pay-
check. ,

President Clinton signed a $26 billion
spending bill on Friday that includes rais-
es for all members of Congress.

It also includes pay increases for fed-
eral judges.

The cost-of—living raise of 2.3 percent
will lift lawmakers’ salaries from about
$133,000 per year to more than $136,000.

The raise was part of a bill covering
the Treasury Department and other agen-
cres.

That measure also included funding
to combat violent crime and for a nation-
al anti—drug media campaign.

WASHINGTON —-— No big deal.

That’s what the superintendent at
Mount Rushmore says about escorting
political money givers to the top of
George Washington’s head.

Dan Wenk acknowledges he gave
that special tour to about 20 contributors
to South Dakota Senator Tom Daschle,
the Senate’s top Democrat. The guests
were attending a fund-raising event for
Daschle at $5,000 a head. Most were
Washington lobbyists.

Superintendent Wenk says he knew
they were supporters of Daschle but did-
n’t know much else. And he says “it did-
n’t matter.”

Wenk says he takes about 20 groups

a year to the top of the mountain. .

Most tourists are barred from the
mountain top. But Daschle’s office rejects
any claim that he sold access to a nation-
al landmark to raise political funds.

GARDEN CITY, Ga. — Ofﬁcials say
an Amtrak train struck a stalled tractor
trailer in Georgia Friday because the
warning of the stalled truck went to the
wrong train‘ dispatcher. The truck had
been on the tracks 20 minutes when the
train came along. A dozen people were
injured but none seriously.

NEW YORK — Marv Albert has
entered counseling in the wake of his sex-
ual—assault case.

His publicist says the disgraced
sportscaster is trying to rebuild his life
after pleading guilty to misdemeanor
assault and battery in Virginia.

Albert had been accused of biting a
woman and forcing her to perform oral
sex. His plea came after lurid testimony
about a fondness for women’s underwear
and threesomes.

The publicist says Albert has had a
number of potential job offers since he
entered the plea and NBC fired him.

The head of a New York sports radio
station (WFAN) acknowledges he’s
talked to Albert but says he hasn’t made
an offer.

Albert’s spokesman says the sports-
caster won’t return to work until he gets
his life straightened out.

Heather Sembrat, a recruiter for

said that students who attend job fairs are
"the cream of the crop, because they are
concerned with their futures after gradu-

Sembrat demonstrated the success
of job fairs by recalling a Pitt student
whom she met last year. The student had

"Employers in those areas don't have
to actively recruit students. They can sit
back and let students come to them,"
McCormick said. "Some companies are
also looking for all majors. Students are
quick to look for the obvious careers

McCormick added that evaluations

DATE VIOLENCE

the local and national media
have been hounding Frieze for
interviews.

The study was first pub-
lished in articles found in
Violence and Victims and the
Journal of Social and Personal
Relationships between 1992 and
1994.

In the past few days, Frieze
has been interviewed by three
Pittsburgh TV stations and
countless radio stations around
the country, including CBS
radio affiliates in New York and
Dallas. On Friday, she was a
guest, via telephone, on a radio
talk show broadcast from
Minnesota.

According to Blake, the pos-
sibility of men's eventually
turning violent was also a con-
cern of people interviewed by
the local TV stations. She said
the stations built on the find-
ings' controversial nature by
interviewing workers from local
battered—women's shelters.

The workers at the shelters
were angered by the study
because they consider men to be
the predominant aggressors.

However, according to
Blake, the study could only
‘speak for 18- to 22-year-old col-
lege students.

She said that Frieze is con-
cerned about the violence of this
age group escalating as its mem-

bers get older. Frieze-hopes to

obtain funding to launch a study
of a group of persons beginning
when they are in their late teens
or early 20s and lasting for a
period of 10 to 20 years.

Frieze and Kathy Ryan, a
Pitt psychology professor who
helped with the dating-violence
study, applied for a grant from
an unspecified organization to
fund the longitudinal study but
were not selected for funding.

Frieze said Ryan is in the
process of rewriting the propos-
al but is not sure where Frieze
and Ryan stand in terms of
resubmitting it.

"The longitudinal study is
something I would like to do in
the future," Frieze said, "but it
[the process of conducting the
study] is very slow and expen-
sive."

According to Frieze, the
study consisted of 300 students
in Pitt's Introduction to
Psychology classes who
responded to a ﬂyer on a bul-
letin board located on the sec-
ond ﬂoor of Langley Hall. The

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE 1

board has sign—up sheets for
psychology graduate students
who need subjects for their
experiments. Every Intro to
Psych student is required to par-
ticipate in a certain number of
these experiments to fulfill a
course requirement.

Students who signed up for
Frieze’s study filled out anony-
mous surveys about their dating
relationships. Some students
were then called back for face-
to-face interviews.

Twenty-nine percent of par-
ticipants in the study reported
that women had threatened men
with violence, whereas only 10
percent of men did.

  
   
   
   
   
 
  
  

 

Thirty—eight percent reported
that women pushed or shoved
their male partners. Fifteen per-
cent reported that men pushed
the women.

Twenty percent reported that
women kicked their male part-
ners, and only 1 percent report-
ed that the men kicked the
women.

Frieze said this is not the
first time one of her experi-
ments has gained national noto-
riety. In the late 1980s, she con-
ducted a study of the correlation
between the heights and
incomes of people in the busi-
ness world, and she still gets
calls from people who have just
heard about it. I

More grants for

9 domestic violence

research needed

Violence is violence. .

No matter whether it comes during dating, during
childhood, in rich Beverly Hills homes or on inner—city
streets, from a man or from a woman, violence cannot
be condoned. ’

A news story in this issue details a study that sug-
gests women tend to bring violence into relationships
more often and earlier than men. Some may be surprised
immediately by this ——confused by the fact that so many
women’s shelters exist but men’s shelters do not.

The fact is that men seem to do a lot more damage
when they become violent. But that doesn’t mean that

' violence is unacceptable only when it comes from men.

Violence escalates. A push begets a shove. A slap
begets a punch. Escalation is what makes the results of
this study so scary, because if women think too hghtly
of the “low-level” violence they do, it may lead to even
more “high-level” violence and domestic abuse. in the
future.

The escalation phenomenon begins with the pro-
gramming we receive growing up.

We hear fancy rhetoric that we take for gospel, hke,
“Never start a ﬁght, but always end it.”

We’re never told the difference between justice and
revenge.

And though most parents will tell their boys never to
hit women, we almost never hear the reverse.

That kind of social programming breeds violence. It

A may be “low-level” violence. It may consist of nothing

more damaging than slapping and throwing small
objects. But that doesn’t make it right. In fact, it’s wrong.
Now, it is very important that everybody under-
stands exactly what we are and what we are not saying.
We absolutely are not saying that it’s women’s fault

when men beat them. Nobody is responsible for any-

one’s actions but their own.

We are saying that there is no excuse for violence.
The fact that she hit him ﬁrst is not an excuse for him to
hit her. But the fact that she is a woman is not an excuse
for her to start being violent, either.

And we most certainly are saying that there must be
more funding for this kind of research. Anything that
sheds light on why domestic violence occurs and how

we can help prevent it is vitally important if we are A

going to honestly call ourselves civilized.

No real evidence for global warming

Paul

Clark

If we do not stop global
warming right now, the eﬁects
will be disastrous. The C02
pumped out by American indus-
try has created a greenhouse
eﬁect, causing temperatures to
increase dramatically, and if we
don ’t stop it, our children will 

The same rhetoric has been
gushing forth from environ-
mentalists for so long that
almost everyone knows the
words. Most people blindly eat

. up every word without a second

of thought,’ and they have been
fooled. The g1obal—warming
theory has little base in sci-
ence, and has not been proven,
yet has been promoted» by envi-
ronmentalists, in cooperation
with the national media and the
Democratic Party, as if it were
an undeniable fact.

Global warming has always
been nothing but a theory. The
only documented, real tempera-
ture increase is 1 degree
Fahrenheit over the past 150
years. Some scientists think that
the temperature is going to
increase in the future based on
computer simulations that have
been shown to be ﬂawed in the
past. Funny, but scientists in the
early 1970s had a theory, too.
They began to emphatically
warn about global cooling, and
if something isn’t done soon,
well, the Earth will slip into
another Ice Age.

Speaking of cool-downs,
although We’re now experienc-
ing an October with tempera-
tures in the 80s, does anyone
out there remember almost four

years ago in January 1994? A
refresher: Pittsburgh dropped to
a record low of minus 23
degrees Fahrenheit. In one
week, this monumental cold
wave claimed 130 lives. Didn’t
hear too much about global
warming that winter," did we?
Simply put, people are more
willing to accept the unsupport-
ed idea of global warming when
they are not freezing their
kahonies off.

Other scientists and doctors
have been “coming out” (to
steal the liberal term) and stand-
ing up against global warming.
Dr. John Christy of the
University of Alabama states,
“We’ve had total satellite cov-
erage of the Earth since 1979,
and we sure don’t see it  no
sign of such warming has
shown up in the satellite data.”
Frederick Seitz, president of the
National Academy of -Sciences,
accuses the United Nations of
deliberately changing the first
conclusion of the United
Nations Climate Report which
said that not one study shows
clear evidence in support of the
greenhouse effect. Dr. Jane
Francis of Leeds University
states that any attempts to affect
the global climate are “farci-
cal.”

“Do you know just how
many trillions of tons of CO2
are being pumped into our air
by factories?” scream the tree
huggers. Yes, I do:

In mankind’s entire exis-
tence, we have put out 17.6 tril-
lion kilograms of CO2.

This may seem like a stag-
gering number that in itself
places blame on mankind for

THE PITT NEWS

polluting the planet. However,
each year nature pumps out 5
trillion kilograms of CO2
through volcanic activity. -Do
the math: Every four years the
Earth pollutes itself more than
all of mankind has throughout
all of history.

One may ask why the tree
huggers would lie about their
own environment that they care
about so very much. Answer:
The real movers and shakers of

environmentalist groups aren’t ‘

environmentalists — they’re
lobbyists, and it’s their job. The
Environmental Defense Fund,
International Panel on Climate
Change and others all get paid
to promote environmental legis-
lation. If there are no problems
with the environment, then they
lose their paychecks.

Finally, in Kyoto, Japan,
other nations are taking advan-
tage of our ignorance. They will
utilize CO2 emissions as a tool
to not only hold back the busi-
nesses and industry of the
United States, but to bring us
down to their level. In foreign-
trade competition, all other
countries would have it a lot
easier if that damned United
States would quit producing so
much! Bill Clinton, like other
liberals, being so engrossed in
the notion that all nations of the
world will eventually unite in
one huge, loving government, is
willing to sacrifice American
prosperity for this goal, all in
the name of global warming.

Columnist

Can the Promise Keepers’ ideals be
trusted? Personally, I am hesitant to
label their mission as not having a hid-
den agenda. On the surface, their quest
is admirable. I didn’t think much of
them when they were in Pittsburgh, but
the extent to which they have taken their
efforts, showcased in Washington,
frightens me... Can we really say that it
will stay at face value? This “sacred
assembly of men” could be the source of
some major trouble.

I wouldn’t call myself a radical fem-
inist, and I am far from being anti-reli-
gious. I believe in the power of an indi-
vidual’s faith and the impact that it can
have on the masses. Actually, it is that
universal impact that scares me to an
extent in this case. If something gets
twisted and gets out of control, the
repercussions are going to be unbeliev-
able. Wars have begun merely on the
basis of religious beliefs.

Even though they claim to not be
seeking subordinate status for the
woman in society, they want men to
“take charge and claim responsibility for
their families.” In an ideal family, the
husband and wife are on equal footing,
and no one needs to or should have to
“take charge.” A relationship is a two-
way street, not one person tagging along
after the other. Women have fought for

‘these efforts.

THE PITT NEWS

Promise Keepers’ idea sounds good but could turn to oppression

years to stray from the “old—fashioned”
values of what was “meant” for them in
life. A woman had her place, and if she
knew what was good for her, she didn’t
wander far from that. Ambition and
drive didn’t count for anything. Now,
women strive to achieve goals they set
for themselves, not those arranged by
society. The Promise
Keepers’ movement
could seriously injure

A woman speak-
ing on TV in support
of her husband as a
Promise Keeper said,
“If God meant me to
be a doctor, then I
would be a doctor, but
God has planned for
me to be here for [my
husband] David.” .

That is the exact attitude that some of '

these Promise Keepers are instilling,
and it will do nothing but harm for gen-
der equality. As a Roman Catholic, it is
my belief that modern faiths do not
explicitly tell women to do what “God
has in store,” but to follow their own
dreams in a Christian manner. This is far
different from that woman who -was tak-
ing “her place” as her husband’s follow-
er. ‘ I

The men supposedly want to
become better role models as fathers,
husbands, etc. Well, who is the authori-

 

ty that can give an all—encompassing
definition of a ‘good’’ man? Regardless
of the roles they are in, their worth
should not be judged on one narrow
standard. Most religions promote accep-
tance of diversity and finding one’s
niche. This should also include family
and life roles. There are many different
paths in a marriage, in
fatherhood, and in any
relationship for that
matter. Who are the
Promise Keepers to
say that their way is
the best and only way?
They also want
to wage a war against
racism. While this is a
noble cause, they. are
again being too nar-
row—minded. What
about sexism, age dis-
crimination and religious discrirnina—
tion? If they are going to take on a task
such as this, it should be on —a much
wider scope: bias and discrimination in
general. They have the strength_and the
numbers to do it, so why haven’t they?
While praying, bonding and medita-
tion do much for the psyche, it is actions
that will count in the long run. What is
going to result from these revivals?
Maybe what is said will eventually fade
away and not make any difference. This
is not what I want to happen. I am just
afraid that some Promise Keepers are

7

going to keep a very backward and con-
voluted promise. One that started out
innocently enough but got twisted
around by the individual and then by
larger groups. All it takes is one person
to get the ball "rolling. This could affect
all of us, like a ripple. If it does, I hope
it is in a good way, but I cannot see how
that would be the case.

A spokesman for these men said, “A I

house divided cannot stand.” Well, they
are in fact dividing it, just in a different
way from the previous way. They are
defeating their own supposed purpose.
If they “take responsibility” or “take
charge,” we really will have “a house
divided.” Who knows, it might be your
own. The only way to combat this is by
awareness. We carmot allow ourselves
to lose sight of our dreams and beliefs
just because there have been these
revivals. If people become better from
them, then so be it, that’s great. I am just
very wary of what could be on the other
side of the mountain.

It’s an upward climb, and every-
thing seems just ﬁne. Then, you get to
the peak and realize you are stepping off
of a cliff. We must be cautious and not
lose sight of our goal of equality. If we
don’t, we’ll be “standing in the gap” that
the Promise Keepers made for us.

Jennifer Stoltz has made a “promise” to
herself to become a doctor, no matter
whose plans this may or may not be in.

Irish win blue-and-gold battle, 45-21

Ned Schano

Sentor Staff Writer

The Pitt football team entered Saturday’s
game with Notre Dame looking for another

magical home win afterva disheartening loss to

Temple last weekend.

There was no such luck, though, as the big-
ger and stronger Fighting Irish (2-4) manhan—
dled the Panthers (3-3). Yet despite the lop-
sided 45-21 score, the Panthers played
respectably in front of 47,306 fans at Pitt
Stadium. i

“I thought our players gave the kind of
effort that we need to have,” Panther Head
Coach Walt Harris said. “I thought our guys
came to play, and that’s what we need to do.”

The Panthers were unable to stop the Notre
Dame "ground attack. The Irish racked up 317
yards on the ground as both Autry Denson and
Clement Stokes rushed for over 100 yards.
Pitt’s offense showed signs of life, especially
in the second half, but the Panthers could not
dig themselves out of an early hole.

The opening kickoff started the game with
a bang. Notre Dame senior Allen Rossum fum-
bled Paul Ruzila’s kickoff at the 7-yard line
before picking up the loose ball and scamper-
ing 93 yards down the ‘right sideline. The
Fighting Irish led 7-0 just 17 seconds into the

Effort, (comebacks nearly pay off for Pitt

Rachel Lenzl

Staff Writer

A majority of the Pitt faithful who
traveled up Cardiac Hill Saturday

afternoon might have had that feeling ‘

— the one that sits in the bottom of

your stomach — that the Panthers

were going to lose this game. Big.

It’s sort of like the feeling you get
after eating a seven-course meal at the
660'”

But much to the fans’ relief, the
score wasn’t a 54-point blowout like
last year. It was only 24 points, sort of
like a nice Pepcid AC tablet that eases

the pain of a night of grease-induced

heartburn.

Twenty-four points is a signifi-
cant gap, but not against the Fighting
Irish of Notre Dame. Not against
Autry Denson, the centerpiece of a
Notre Dame offense that before
Saturday only accounted for one win
and 70 points, as compared to the
opposition’s 118.

One win. Knute Rockne, the Four
Horseman, Rocket Ismail and “Rudy”
were all rolling in their respective

s - n m u . . - . n : o a n u ~ » « » u - , . a . . . a » » pv»Ihl

football graves. The Irish knew it and
came in angry, hungry and ready to
ﬁght. -

So did Pitt. Regardless of their 3-
3 record so far, the hard-working
Panthers, like the Irish, had their pride
on the line after the 60-6 whipping
last November. Not to mention those
two little words that have the Oakland
community yearning for Panther foot-
ball after Christmas: bowl game.

The key for the Panthers in gain-
ing their fourth victory? Stop
Denson? Bowl over Ron Powlus,
Public Enemy No. 1 in Oakland?

Not quite. The key, as always, was
good old—fashioned hard work.

The Panthers worked hard, as
they have all season, but couldn’t stop
the Autry Denson Show. Or, for that
matter, the Clement Stokes Show. Or

the Allen Rossum Show. The three '

combined for 331 yards on the
ground.

Notre Dame razzled and dazzled
its national and international fans -
including about 17,000 or so who fol-
lowed their beloved Irish to the Steel
City — with their golden helmets and

their ﬂashy offense.

Pitt has its work ethic to go by
(and its just-as-ﬂashy gold helmets),
but as Head Coach Walt Harris and
several of his players stated after the
game, spirit and heart only go so far.

But spirit and heart are key com-
ponents in giving the opposition a run
for its money. Pitt hung tough and
didn’t give up through 60 minutes of
football. ’

“My job this year is to get our
guys to learn to play hard,” said
Harris, “and I think our players gave
the kind of effort that I think it’s
important for us to play with.”

Notre Dame seemed to have the
game won early —— from the time
Rossum scored on a 93-yard kickoff
return 17 seconds into. the contest -
but Pitt’s comeback attempts were
numerous.

Just after halftime, a number of
the Pitt fans threw in the towel and
headed for the exits. But right after
Notre Dame’s Jim Sanson knocked in
his 22-yard field goal to make it 17-0,
the Panthers tried to play catch-up.

In the aftermath of all of the Notre
Dame hoopla, Pitt sports had another
big matchup. This one featured the Pitt
men’s soccer team facing off against the
Georgetown Hoyas in an important Big
East conference game.

Pitt entered the contest ranked 16th
overall in the national rankings, but
Georgetown, not ranked in the Top 25,
was ranked first in the Big East stand-
ings, with Pitt second.

Pitt also came into the game seek-
ing revenge after last season’s 2-0
shutout of the Panthers at Georgetown.

Georgetown’s offense came out fir-
ing early, but Pitt fought them off and
played tough defense. Then, with
Georgetown -putting offensive pressure
on Pitt deep in its‘ own zone, senior
Hoya forward John Greaser headed in a
centering pass from teammate Eric
Kvello for the game’s opening goal.
Freshman midﬁelder Kyle Rakow
kicked a pass from the right comer in
toward the goal, where it was picked up
by Kvello, who had his blocked shot

(seven goals, one assist) on the season.
Mati1la’s opportunity woke up the
Panther offense, as they held possession
of the ball longer and continued to drive
into Hoya territory. Pitt continued its
offensive surge with the ﬁnal minutes
ticking away, but came up empty as the
Hoya defense continuously turned
away Panther shots. Georgetown out-
shot Pitt 5-1 in the first frame.

In the second half, Pitt stormed out
and picked up where it left off by apply-
ing pressure on the Hoyas in their own
zone. Matilla was robbed by Hoya
sophomore goalie T‘yler Purtill early in
the second frame. Matilla rocketed a
shot directly into the chest of Purtill,
but the goalkeeper held on for the save.

Pitt continued to apply defensive
pressure at midﬁeld. The Panther
defense caused a key turnover early in
the second half, but an attacking Matilla
had his shot deﬂected wide on the play.

The very next play was a corner
kick that was deﬂected out to senior

The University of Pittsburgh
women’s soccer team came off its
biggest win ever to play to a tie
and a loss on the road this.week-
end in Big East action.

Saturday, the Lady Panthers
traveled to Boston to take on the
‘Boston College Eagles. The
Eagles defeated the Panthers 2-0
to up their record to 7-4-1 overall.
Pitt dropped to 1-8-2 overall.

Boston College opened up the
scoring very early in the game.
Megan Burns passed the ball to
Mary Guarino near the midfield
stripe, and Guarino broke in alone
behind the Panther defense.

Unlike her performance earlier
in the week against West Virginia,

Pitt keeper Nicole Bashor was‘

unable to make any great saves,
like she did on a number of occa-
sions against West Virginia earlier
in the week. Guarino was able to
slip her shot by the freshman goal-
keeper, giving the Eagles a 1-0

As the second half began,
Boston College again drew blood
early. Just eight minutes into the
second half, Kerri Wright headed a
ball into the net to make the score
2-0.

The goal was unassisted, and it
gave the Eagles a lead they would

Eagles’- keeper Courtney
Schaeffer made three saves on her

game also marked the -seventh
time in 10 games that the Panthers

Bashor stopped 11 BC shots
before leaving the game. Her
replacement, Ilene Ravich, turned
away four more shots in the loss.

Up to this point, the Panthers

had been out—scored 31-3 overall, ,

game.

The play conjured up memories
of last season’s embarrassing 60-6
Pitt loss at Notre Dame Stadium,
when Rossum returned two punts for
touchdowns against the Panthers.

After Pitt’s first drive stalled,
Notre Dame wasted little time
padding its lead, "as junior tailback
Autry Denson ran off a right tackle
for a 50-yard burst into the end zone.

Notre Dame led 14-0 less than
halfway into the first quarter, but Pitt
had opportunities to cut into the
Notre Dame lead later in the half.
After three Panther drives concluded
with punter Grant Coffield’s repeat-
edly wobbly punts, Pitt received a
break in the second quarter.

Converted tailback Hank Poteat
intercepted Notre Dame quarterback
Ron Powlus at 8:54 of the second
quarter. Powlus’ pass was tipped by
free safety John Jenkins into the
awaiting hands of Poteat, who
returned the pick 42 yards to the
Notre Dame 9-yard line.

Pitt was unable to capitalize on
the turnover, however, as quarter-
back Pete Gonza1ez’s third-down
pass was dropped by tight end John
Jones. Chris Ferencik’s 32-yard
field—goal attempt sailed right, pre-
venting the Panthers from cutting
into the lead.

Panthers settled down after their
shaky start.

“The offense was very inconsis-
tent early,” Harris said. “Our quar-
terback didn’t settle in.”

Harris was referring to fifth-year
senior Gonzalez, who said he
thought he ‘‘looked like a freshman”
in the first half, completing just three
of 12 passes for a paltry 15 yards.
Gonzalez regained his composure in
the second half, finishing with 216
yards on 16 of 32 passing.

“I was trying to do too much
offensively [in the first half],”
Gonzalez said.

Both offenses shined in the sec-
ond half, as the teams combined for
52 points.

Pitt’s offense calmed down in the
second half after a 22-yard field goal
by Notre Dame’s Jim Sanson.

Senior tailback Dwayne
Schulters’ 6-yard touchdown scam-
per capped a six-play, 80-yard drive.
The scoring drive was highlighted by
a 34-yard ﬂea-flicker pass to wide
receiver Terry Murphy, who grabbed
the ball away from two Notre Dame
defenders. The pass was set up as
what appeared to be a Schulters off-
tackle run, but the tailback pitched
the ball back to Gonzalez, who fired
the 34-yard bomb.

Pitt’s momentum was short-

The first half featured a slow-
paced game + neither team scored
a goal or came all that close.
Bashor returned to the net for the
Panthers and kept the Lady Friars
off the board.

Pitt opened the scoring in the
second half when Charity Kriley
took a pass from Charity McClure
and banged it into the net behind
Providence keeper Shanya Ross at
67:34. .

The Pitt lead did not last long,

THE PITT NEWS

as Providence midfielder Melissa
Crowley answered with a goal of
her own at 74:08, with an assist
from Jill Flanagan. Flanagan
kicked a cross-field pass to

Crowley, who was able to pound‘

the ball behind Bashor.

Bashor registered seven saves
in regulation and three in the over-
time period. She has shone all sea-
son for the Panthers, who are still
searching for whatever bright spots
they can find’ in their first season
of Big East soccer action.

On the other side of the field,
Ross also made seven saves in reg-
ulation and recorded two in the

Nov. 2

overtime.

The tie leaves the Friars with a
3-6-2 mark overall, and a 0-5-1
record in the Big East Conference,
with only three Big East games
remaining on their schedule.

The Panthers have added a win
and a tie in their conference in the
last week to raise their Big East
mark to 1-6-1.

Due to their busy travel sched-
ule over the weekend, the Panthers
were unavailable for comment.

The Lady Panthers return home
this Friday night to start at six-
game homestand that will end with
their final regular season game
against Virginia
Commonwealth.

Msocc

banged in a one—timer from 30 yards
out to tie the score at the 69:37 mark. It
was Hoolahan’s first goal of the season,
and he was met with a pile of Panther
players after the goal. Pitt freshman
forward Ben Garry, who was earlier
robbed of a goal, deﬂected the comer
kick out to Hoolahan for the assist.

, Georgetown and Pitt opened up
their offensive attacks after the goal.
Pitt nearly took the leadafter ﬁfth-year
senior Matt Gray’s shot from 20 yards
out rang off the left post with just over
seven minutes remaining.

Pitt senior goalie Chris Hanlon
made key saves after two separate div-
ing stops out into the offensive attacks.
Pitt continued to bombard the Hoyas,
but time ran out in regulation, forcing a
sudden-death overtime.

Pitt’s record in overtime going into
the contest consisted of three ties,
which included 0-0 ties with Notre
Dame and Boston College and a 1-1 tie
with Villanova.

Georgetown began the extra frame
with offensive pressure and never let
up. The Hoyas’ first opportunity came
from junior midﬁelder Billy Bednarz,
whose shot sailed just over the right
comer of the net.

Bednarz, though, would get a sec-
ond chance, taking a centering pass
from Kvello and knocking in the game-
winner at 93:26.

Panther Head Coach Joe
Luxbacher said his team “played very
well today, especially in the second
half. We were looking to jump ahead of
them in the standings. It was a difficult
loss.” V

The overtime heartbreaker dropped
Pitt’s record to 6-2-4 overall, 3-2-3 in
the Big East. Georgetown’s record
improved to 8-4 overall, 6-1 in the Big
East.

In earlier action this week, Pitt
defeated St. Francis (PA) 1-0. Pitt for-
ward Drew Kopp nailed his fourth goal
of the year with an assist from sopho-
more forward Reagan Bender.

Pitt’s next matchup will be a visit
to Canisius on Wednesday night, Oct.
15.
