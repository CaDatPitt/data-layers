Community
rallies for

T myvon Martin  

By Zoe Owrutsky
Staff Writer

Skittles, iced tea and hoodies have become
the most recent symbols for racial proﬁling,
and those objects were present as around
500 people rallied on Monday to observe
the one month anniversary of Trayvon
Martin’s death. -

Students, faculty and citizens gathered
on Carnegie Mellon’s campus waving signs
and wearing hoodies during thejustice for
Trayvon Martin Rally, organized by CMU’s
Black Graduate Student Organization.

During the hour-long rally, a few Pitt
and CMU students each spoke brieﬂy about
their own encounters with racial proﬁling
and discrimination and outlined what citi-

zens can do to achieve justice in the case of
Trayvon Martin.

Martin was a 17-year-old black man who
was shot and killed by George Zimmer-
man, a neighborhood watch volunteer in

‘Sanford, Fl., a suburb of Orlando. Martin

was walking through a gated community on
Feb. 26 when Zimmerman, who had called
911 to report Martin as a suspicious person,
began following him. Soon after, Martin
was fatally wounded after Zimmerman shot
him in the chest. Martin was unarmed, only
carrying a bag of Skittles and an iced tea.
Zimmerman, a white Hispanic man,
claims he shot Martin in self-defense, but
the case has led to accusations of racial

Pitt teams with

US Department of

Justice in bomb threat investigation

By Mallory Grossmanv
News Editor

Pitt has enlisted the U.S. Department of
Justice to help its investigation into the
recent string of Cathedral of Learning
bomb threats.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said the
University asked assistance from the fed-
eral department after this month’s recent
spate of bomb threats. The Cathedral
received three bomb threats within nine
days, and Hill said a person of interest has
been associated with all three threats.

He said that all three threats appeared
in a ground ﬂoor men’s restroom stall in
the Cathedral.

In February, Pitt police found a bomb
threat written on the stall of a women’s
restroom in the Chevron Science Center.

Those convicted of making bomb
threats may face penalties such as impris-
onment and ﬁnes, Hill said. Convicted

 

students could also be expelled. _
Last year, charges were dropped
against former Pitt student Louisa Nk-
rumah of Harrisburg after federal pros-
ecutors said that she called Pitt police and
threatened to destroy the Cathedral and
Posvar Hall in 2008. A judge dismissed
the charges against her in April 2011 once
she completed 150 hours of community
service and paid Pitt $8,000 over the
course of one year.

While no motive for this month’s.

threats month has been discovered, Hill
said the search to identify the responsible
parties continues.

All bomb threats occurred during the
morning, with the ﬁrst appearing March
14. The next two threats happened on
March 19 and 22.

Pitt sent out an Emergency Notiﬁca-
tion System alert to the campus commu-
nitypotifying them of the threats, none of
which speciﬁed a time or location within
the building. I

Sophomore Michelle Kerbel has
not always been a grilled cheese
expert. When she met with her
upperclassmen friends at Nordy’s
Place on Thursdays last year, she
would bring her own lunch.

Now she knows better.

“The ﬁrst week I was lame,
but then I learned, and I’ve had
grilled cheese every week on cam-
pus since,” Kerbel said. “I’m not
impressed by a basic grilled cheese
sandwich. Plain cheese just doesn’t
impress me anymore.”

On Thursdays after the 11 a.m.
deli opening, Kerbel is with the
lunchtime rush, discussing orders
at the back of the room. The Feel-
Good club members behind the ta-
ble write down Kerbel’s usual order
—— the Grilled Cheese of Learning,
no tomato, with tomato sauce and
pesto. The order is passed to her as
the white—gloved hands of the deli
workers weave their way across the
large table of ingredients.

“It’s a good event because it’s
ﬁlled with people we’ve met and
become friends with,” Kerbel said.
“I can count on seeing the same
faces at [FeelGood] each week.”

FeelGood partners with The
Hunger Project, a global non-proﬁt
organization, which operates its
program within 11 countries. The
money raised through FeelGood
helps fund skills training programs
that focus on literacy, numeracy,
nutrition and local laws, accord-
ing to The Hunger Project’s oﬁicial
site.

The FeelGood members be-
gin their setup in Nordy’s at 10
a.m., preparing for the four-hour
lunch period. From 11 a.m. to 3
p.m., workers make around 140
sandwiches, which generates up
to $500 per week.

FeelGood PresidentAidan Smith
said that the group suggests a $3
donation, but have been known
to give away free sandwiches and
accept larger donations. He said
the club once collected $20 for a
single sandwich.

FeelGood sells grilled Cl‘l‘t‘€S€ sanclx-\'icl1es at Nordy’s Place in the William Pitt Union.

“We aim to attack all of the
issues that surround hunger,
because it’s a Cycle.”
-Aidan Smith

“It was a crazy donation, but
it does happen because people
are willing to give to a good cause
and are often generous,” the ju-
nior said. “One hundred percent
of the proceeds go to The Hunger
Project.”

The group of about 30 members
also sells organic coffee and Feel-
Good T-shirts. They accept cash,
and credit and debit cards.

Smith said that FeelGood rein-
forces the idea of sustainability.

“We see the need for hunger as

a want for self-reliance. We aim
to attack all of the issues that sur-
round hunger because it’s a cycle,”
Smith said.

Smith said that the group re-
ceives part of its budget from the
Student Government Board and
gathers donations through other
means as well. He said that each
level of funding, Whether allocated
or donated, is viewed as a loan, and
the group works to stress that each
dollar given to fund the Thursday
event produces around three dol-
lars that are donated directly to
The Hunger Project.

Sophomore Michael Nites stood
before a copious list of ingredients
and ordered fo_r the ﬁrst time last
Thursday. While he waited, he in-

teracted with the people also wait-
ing for their foil—wrapped orders
from the six portable grills behind
the deli.

“This is my ﬁrst time at Feel-
Good. It’s actually pretty sad be-
cause I’ve stolen pieces from other
people’s sandwiches but had never
had one myself, so I ﬁgured that I
should try it out,” Nites said.

The ingredients are all sus-
tainable and create seven differ-
ent sandwiches: Grilled Cheesus,
Grilled Cheese of Learning, Pan-
ther Pizza, Feel Bueno, Grilled
Granny Smith, Cheeseless Cheese
and Make Your Own.

Customers are encouraged to

proﬁling by the media.

Participants at the rally wore hoodies and
passed around bags of Skittles and bottles of
iced tea, the same items Martin had with him
when he was shot, according to reports.

Brittany Claud, vice president of CMU’s
Black Graduate Student Organization and
co—organizer of the rally, opened up the
event by urging people to come together
to ﬁght stereotypes. She said people need

to become more involved in government to F

change the laws that are keeping police from
arresting Zimmerman. -

‘.‘Today we are here demanding justice,”
Claud said. “’ ~

Florida’s self-defense laws allow people
to use deadly force without trying to ﬁrst
ﬂee the scene when they feel threatened.
Critics of the “Stand Your Ground” laws say
they might allow for lethal force in cases that
don’t warrant it, pointing to cases including
Zimmerman’s. I ’

Christopher Lindsay, president of the
Impact Movement, a Christian leadership
organization at CMU, also spoke at the rally.
He recounted the racial discrimination he
has experienced at CMU and emphasized
the responsibility of all Americans to ﬁght
stereotypes. .

Lindsay said that although he some-
times jokes about racial stereotypes with
his friends, he feels that most people, along
with himself, can vastly underestimate “the
effects of assumptions.”

People in the crowd waved signs that
read"‘I am Trayvon” and “Castle Doctrine
Kills.”

The Castle Doctrine is another controver-
sial self-defense law, and both Pennsylvania
and Florida have similar ones in the books.
It allows for the use of deadly force when
somebody trespasses on another person’s
property, even if it isn’t clear that the'tres-
passer has any malicious intent.

In Martin’s case, he was not on Zimmer-
man’s property, so the Castle Doctrine would
not apply to the shooting. . ’

Kimberly Ellis, owner of a publishing and
marketing company and visiting Africana
Studies professor at Pitt, also spoke at the
rally, urging students to be more knowledge-
able about their local ofﬁcials and participate
more frequently in all elections. '

“Students, you needto do your home-
work,” Ellis said. “You have to know what’s
happening.” .

Ellis said that it isn’t enough to show up
at a rally and wear a hoodie. She insisted
that all participants know exactly who is in
their government and who is enforcing the
laws, reminding all that they are elected
officials. «

Ricky Burgess, president of CMU’s Black
Graduate Student Organization, wrapped
up the speeches by encouraging people to
come together and “ﬁght the tendency to
stereotype and typecast” one another. He ar-
gued that working toward a more accepting
culture will overcome the fear and distrust

March 27, 2012 I The Pitt News I wvvx/v.pitinevvs.com

that exists among people.

After the rally started, manypeople
stayed to sign petitions demanding that
Martin’s killer, George Zimmerman, be
prosecuted and brought to justice. Orga-
nizers were also registering people to vote
on computers set up at the site.

CMU’s Black Graduate Student Organiza-
tion has plans to host more intimate town
hall meetings in the future. The meetings
would inform people about local ofﬁcials
and the legislature that exists in their own
states and counties.

Claud said that she thought the rally was
“hugely successful”-and that the speakers did

I well in “highlighting culturalism and making
I it very relatable” for all who attended. ._

not provided, such as meat.

“You can bring your own meat, but we
do not offer it because it’s not sustainable,”
Smith said. “All of our products can be pro-
duced through sustainable forms without
the use of massive animal farms.”

Senior Zachary Demby said that he could
understand why people line up for a grilled
cheese. -

“It’s really a triple threat — and a triple

win — situation,” Dembysa-id. “First of all, A

there is grilled cheese. It 7doesn’t get much
better than that. Second, it only costs three

.3

dollars. Third of all, but I suppose it is also
ﬁrst of all, you are helping the hungry in
need. What could be better?”

FeelGood member Nathan Poloni moved
from behind the deli to order and donate.

“The Feel Bueno is my favorite to make
because it is also my favorite to eat,” the
junior said. “I associate it with contentment
and the feeling of being full.”

Smiling, he admitted that he didn’t like
grilled cheese before becoming involved
with the group.

“I hadn’t had good grilled cheese, but only
the kind smacked together between two soggy
pieces of Wonder Bread,” Poloni said. “Then I
had my ﬁrst FeelGood, and as the cliche goes,
it was all history from there.”-

More than a month after the

Hispanic man and neighbor-

wrongdoing, chased after him
and eventually ended? his life.

“Martin was wearing a hoodie

He was unarmed.’

I Zimmerman told police he

in June? 2011. In addition, a re-
cent change in Pennsylvania’s

cases, violence may be the ﬁrst
response. ‘b
There are 21 laws across the

it’s not likely that Pennsylva-

Thus, under certain circum-
stances, Pennsylvania would
allow for the same tragedy to
happen. Let’s not forget that
the local police have had their
transgressions as well. Consid-
ering the 1995 killing of 31-year-

A NHDWESTERN PIECE

Pitt’s transgender policy necessary

 
     

By Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

The debate over where trans-
gender students may or may not
use the bathroom has produced
some strong reactions. The Pitt
News’ own editorial board con-
demned the position of the Uni-
versity —that everybody goes
to the bathroom in accordance
with the sex listed on their birth
certiﬁcates —— as regressive.
While I think that the Univer-
sity should do more to accom-
modate transgender students,
the policy adopted by the Uni-
versity is simple, absolute and
avoids legal and political prob-
lems that would be caused by the
blanket alternatives available to
it, which we must examine from
the University’s perspective.
What are the ‘alternatives?
First, the school could have con-
tinued to study each individual
case as it came up. Second, the
University could have allowed
transgender students to use the
bathrooms of their choice. Part
of the problem with a case—by-
case decision—making process is
that it is difﬁcult to see how indi-
vidual cases can be evaluated to
the satisfaction of all involved.
Does the transgender person
have to take a quiz? Solemnly
swear that he or she really, truly
identiﬁes as the opposite gen-

der? Submit to psychiatric evalu-
ation? Any of these things would
make people unhappy. For in-
stance, the alternative of having
a health care provider submit a
letter certifying that a person is
really transgender might not be
optimal. If some doctors refuse
to provide these kinds of letters,
we would witness exactly the
same kind of controversy as with
doctors who refuse to prescribe
the morning—after pill. Such a
process wouldn’t eliminate the
problems I noted with a case-
by—case basis, it would only shift
them onto doctors. I will grant,
though, that this is probably not
a bad compromise measure.

If a transgender person were
to request the right to use the
bathroom of his or her choice
and have that request refused,
no matter what the circumstanc-
es, a legal ﬁrestorm and media
circus would result. A case—by-
case approach would therefore
effectively mean that anybody
who bothered to ask would be
granted the right to use the pre-
ferred bathroom.

So why not save the paper-
work and allow anyone to use
the bathroom that he or she
identiﬁes with? This would ren-
der the difference between a
ladies’ and a men’s room mean-
ingless: Who’s to question your
decision to go into a particular
restroom, anyway? There is thus

the potential for abuse, with one
hypothetical situation being
that a man could enter a wom-
en’s bathroom, harm a woman
in that bathroom and claim that
he had the right to be there be-
cause he identiﬁes as female.
Of course, that man could still
commit the same crime under
current policy. The difference
would be that in the lawsuit that
the woman’s lawyer would ﬁle,
it would be much easier to con-
vince a jury that the abuse was
“all Pitt’s fault” if Pitt’s policy
held that the male assailant had
a right to be in that bathroom.
The University would have to
justify why the man was allowed
to be there, both in court and in
the court of public opinion. That
would get ugly.

The policy the University
adopted, that everyone use the
bathroom that’s listed on their
birth certiﬁcates, is simple. It
rests on a legal document. It is
possible to change one’s legal
standing through sex reassign-
ment surgery, which is a case—by-
case arbiter, as it demonstrates
that someone is truly serious
about his or her sexual identity
in a way that all the affidavits in
the world couldn’t.

Also consider the University’s
political position, in a complete-
ly Machiavellian way. Now is not

COLUMN

Consider weaknesses of perfectionism

   

‘ ; By Courtney Strauss
V Columnist

 
 

I hate job interviews‘. I’ve only
gone to enough to count with my
two hands, but each one of them
has turned me into a phony spaz.
Sure, this might result in me
busking as a slam poet, nanny-
ing and making bottle-cap jew-
elry for the rest of my life, but
that’s better than turning into a
uptight khaki—wearer, right?

OK, so I guess I need to get
used to the whole job interview
process. And the one thing I’ve
vowed never to deﬁne myself as
is a “perfectionist.”

Perfectionism has become
the go-to answer for the sure—to—
be-asked question, “What’s your
biggest weakness?” It’s as gener-
ic as a high schooler rating “The
Great Gatsby” as .a good book.
I’d venture to guess that most of
our peers entering the job mar-
ket exhibit at least some of the
positive and negative qualities
that come with perfectionism.

But many people don’t realize
that this condition carries seri-
ous psychological side effects.
You wouldn’t confess to a po-
tential employer that you suffer
from depression or bulimia, and
perfectionism, for some people,
approaches that line.

Allan Mallinger and Jean-
nette DeWyze, authors of the
book “Too. Perfect: When Being
in Control Gets Out of Control,”
characterize perfectionists as
“obsessives who need to feel in
control at all times to protect
themselves and ensure their
own safety.” The difference be-
tween perfectionism and striv-
ing for excellence, according to
the authors, lies in the deﬁnition
of “mistake.” Those who merely

strive for excellence can take
mistakes as inducements to con-
tinue learning and working. Per-
fectionists, however, take mis-
takes as signs of personal defects
that make them less acceptable.
Maladaptive perfectionists, as a
result, become paralyzed, fear-
ful of taking any action, or go to
great lengths to hide mistakes or
twist outcomes.

There are positive aspects
to perfectionism, of course,
but interviewers might just as
easily associate the condition
with anxiety, low self-esteem,
obsessive-compulsive disorder,
eating disorders, substance
abuse and clinical depression.
Although perfectionists can be
highly successful — see Michel-
angelo, Michael Jackson and
Albert Einstein — they’re now
more readily associated with the

v aforementioned disorders.

Accordingly, when a Teach
for America interviewer asked
me what my weakness was, I de-
cided to cite a perfectionist trait
that can be detrimental but ac-
ceptable. Below, I’ve listed a few
similar options for my fellow
perfectionists.

One problem perfection-
ists suffer from is the hyper-
critical eye. Thus, you could say
your biggest weakness is your
tendency to obsess over edit-
ing your work. This means you
might take a little longer with

projects than necessary and‘

might be more hesitant to deem
something complete. But it also
shows that you’re detail-orient-
ed and a top-notch copy editor.
You could also say your big-
gest weakness is overanalyzing
what you say. You think things
through, but sometimes you
overthink them. The weakness
here is that some of your great

ideas aren’t heard, but it also
shows that your words are well-
chosen.

You don’t want to throw your-
self under the bus by laying claim
to certain detrimental aspects of
perfectionism —— defensiveness
or low self-esteem, for instance
— but you do want to exhibit
honesty, something a competent
interviewer will pick up on.

And for those of you who still
aren’t convinced that perfection-
ism is damaging, remember that
we learn by making mistakes —
your interviewer shouldn’t think
that you’ll enter the workplace
with a closed mind and a defensive
attitude. Remember, also, that the
art of being a star performer is in
knowing which comers to cut.
You can be a hard-working person
and cut corners. Research tends
to show that the anxiety associ-
ated with making mistakes and
not producing a ﬂawless product
tends to interfere with perfor-
mance rather than aid it.

Sure, we all hate those frus-
trating questions: Where do you
see yourself in 10 years? Do you
have any special skills? Tell me
about a time you displayed lead-
ership. They remind me of ques-
tions I’d ask a guy after one too
many drinks at a club, when my
soulmate goggles go on. Cheesy
as they might seem, you better
come up with some stellar an-
swers for them. Showing that
you know yourself well by citing
a speciﬁc weakness instead of
answering with the generic and
potentially detrimental “per-
fectionism” response is the way
to go. If I’m wrong, then I guess
you’ll see me behind my bottle-
cap—jewelry stand on the corner
of Fifth and Bigelow next year. I

a good time for the University to
suddenly show its progressive
bona ﬁdes. This is especially true
as some conservatives around the
country worry that public ﬁnanc-
ing for education is really ﬁnanc-
ing for liberal indoctrination.
Sudden policy changes on the
transgender issue could have cost
Pitt vital political support right
as it was ﬁghting against budget
cuts in Harrisburg. The question
would arise: Why are we paying
for transgender bathrooms? A
private school could do that much
more easily than a public one.

There are better ways that Pitt
can accommodate its transgender
students. It could start by giving
its undergraduates some credit.
When I was living in the dorms,
we occasionally had women who
were familiar to us using our
communal men’s room. Nobody
really made a big deal about it,
and, from what I understand, a
similar mood predominated on
women’s ﬂoors. Earlier in my life,
I had a transgender middle school
principal. Some parents caused a
racket, but largely the kids didn’t
care.

I see no reason why a similar
mood of tolerance wouldn’t be

extended to transgender stu-
dents, or why RAs in charge of
particular ﬂoors can’t ensure this
tolerance. In other words, the
University could set it up so that,
oﬁicially, everyone uses the bath-
room of his or her legal gender
while RAs informally make sure
that transgender students use the
bathrooms of the genders with
which they identify. This insu-
lates the University from political
problems, it gives it plausible de-
niability in court, and the end re-
sult is that transgender students
use their bathroom of choice. It’s
worth considering.

Iwould urge the University
not to just let the restrooms issue
rest with its latest policy. Uni-
versity policymakers should also
consider the provision of more
unisex bathrooms, housing for
transgender students in places
like Bouquet Gardens or Ruskin
Hall where bathrooms are private’
or the establishment of Living
Learning Communities for trans-
gender students. The policy the

‘University adopted was the best

of difficult alternatives, consider-
ing its position. That considered,
I urge it to quietly adopt other
policies that would make being a
transgender student easier. I

Historical Oakland: Neighborhood once epicenter for sports

By Patrick Wagner
Staﬂ” Writer

In 1909, The Pittsburgh Post situated Oak-
land as the apex of the sports world.
“World’s ﬁnest baseball grounds,”
wrote journalist James Jerpe, calling it “an
athletic park far in advance of anything of

its type.” Forbes Field and other structures

made the neighborhood a sports paradise
for much of the 20th century; Pittsbur-
ghers rushed into Oakland and witnessed
teams like the PAA Seven hockey club and
the Pirates play for civic pride. P

“The turn of the 20th century is the
period when Oakland began to develop as
the recreational hub of the city,” said Anne
Madarasz, director of the Western Penn-
sylvania Sports Museum.

Oakland attracted affluent residents
and became a hub of museums and uni-

versities like Pitt and Carnegie Technical.

Schools. Sports culture soon followed.

“The Schenley Park Casino was Pitts-
burgh’s ﬁrst arena, opened in 1894,” Jim
O’Brien said. The sports writer and former
sports information director at Pitt called
the Victorian-styled structure a deﬁning
venue in the city’s hockey history. Not
only was it the ﬁrst arena in the city, it was
North America’s ﬁrst arena with an artiﬁ-
cial ice surface. A

burned the wooden arena to the ground in

leys,” O’Brien said. By 1899, the same barn
was converted to an indoor hockey venue
and had its ﬁrst game. The illuminated
marquis declared it “The Gardens,” but the
imposing stone and brick structure was
nicknamed “The Arena” for its formidable
appearance.

“It was the largest indoor ice facility in
the world,” Madarasz noted. It was signiﬁ-
cantly longer than NHL rinks, and it had to
be retracted when the Pirates hockey team
started playing there.

“The Arena” wouldn’t remain Oakland’s
only sports venue for long, not once the Pi-
rates baseball team started looking for a
new home.

“Barney Dreyfuss, the Pirate’s owner,
picked Oakland for Forbes Field because
he wanted to get his new stadium away
from the North Side and the audience it
had there,” Madarasz said. “He built it
purposefully in Oakland to appeal to that
audience and area.” Opened in 1909, it in-
cluded features that seem standard now,
but at the time were luxuries —— such as
women’s restrooms and the modern look
of steel and concrete.

“People called it Dreyfuss’ folly,” Mad-
arasz said. “No one believed that they
would ﬁll the stadium, but it was overﬂow-
ing the ﬁrst day.” The Pirates, with the help

participate in a televised ﬁght to the death,
known as the Hunger Games. TheVGames,
fought in an outdoor arena and controlled
by “Gamemakers” from the Capitol, are a
demonstration of the Capitol’s power over
the districts: do not rebel again, or else,
they warn.

Living with her mother and 12-year-old
sister in District 12, the poorest of the 12
districts, is 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen.
Katniss is tough, driven and resource-
ful, but appears aloof to many people in
her district. Her persona is a result of her
past and present life. Her father died in
a coal mine explosion when shejwas only
11—years—old, and she was forced to take
over his role as head of the family because
his death sent her mother into a state of
shock and depression.

To feed and provide for herself, her
mother, and her younger sister, Prim, Kat-
niss hunts and gathers illegally with her
best friend Gale in the woods surround-
ing District 12. Both before and during
the Games, she has two sole goals in life:

survive and take care of Prim. When Prim’s '

name is drawn during the reaping ceremo-
ny, Katniss volunteers to take her place in
the Hunger Games.

lently cast. The districts are severely op-
pressed by the brutal Capitol, creating a
difﬁcult relationship to portray in ﬁlm.
Readers sympathize with Katniss and the
other tributes while loathing the heart-
le_ss dictators and shallow spectators from
the Capitol. It was crucial for the cast of
this ﬁlm to bring that relationship to the
screen, and they certainly succeeded.
Lenny Kravitz plays Cinna, Katniss’
stylist and perhaps the only Capitol citizen
who doesn’t make readers cringe. Kravitz
captures all of Cinna’s likable qualities and
makes viewers believe that Cinna actually
cares about Katniss and truly hopes that
she wins. - _
Readers both love to hate and hate to
love Efﬁe Trinket, District Twelve’s Capi—
tol escort, and Haymitch Abernathy, Dis-
trict Twelve’s only living Hunger Games
champion — consequently the mentor for
District Twelve’s tributes every year. Ef-
ﬁe is shallow and self-involved; Haymitch
is a gruff alcoholic who appears less than
dependable —— certainly not suitable as a
mentor for two teenagers about to enter

a ﬁght to the death. Elizabeth Banks and
Woody Harrelson play Efﬁe and Haymitch,
respectively, and both exude a detestable
yet amusing presence. As Katniss starts to
hate Haymitch less, so do viewers.

Stanley Tucci could not have been a
better choice for Caesar Flickerman, the
eccentric man from the Capitol who hosts
the tribute interviews that are broadcast
live for all of Panem. Amandla Stenberg is
charming and lovable as Rue, the young-
est tribute at only twelve years old who re-
minds Katniss of her little sister Prim.

The ﬁ1m’s depiction of the reaping, the
preparation and the actual Games was any-
thing but boring. The audience members
at the midnight premiere were heavily in-
vested in the Games —— reacting vocally
and jumping in scary scenes.

As always, when a book is turned into a
movie, there are many fans to please. While
there were some noticeable differences
between the book and the movie, most

occurred in early scenes, and none were
major plot alterations. All of the changes
seemed to be made for the sake of time; the
movie was already almost two-and—a-half
hours long. Dragging out the pre-—Games
District Twelve scenes would have made it
too long. Furthermore, a great deal of the
novel takes place inside of Katniss’ head,
and only so many thoughts and memories
can be brought to a screen.

Seeing the story unfold onscreen in-
tensiﬁed the already horrifying concept. It
was easier to read about a forced, televised
ﬁght to the death than it was to watch one,
and the ﬁ1m’s portrayal of Panem’s many
injustices reminds fans that the book is
largely a cultural commentary on society’s
numbness to reality television, violence
and socio—economic hierarchies.

For those of you who have not read “The
Hunger Games” trilogy, the good-news is
that you can choose not to and still enjoy
the movie. Reading the books will only add
to the movie viewing experience, but you
certainly won’t be lost if you choose not to
read them.

As always, happy Hunger Games, and
may the odds be ever in your favor.

of legendary shortstop Honus Wagner,
would go on to win their ﬁrst World Series
that year against the Detroit Tigers.

The ballpark continued to change dur-
ing the next 50 years, adding more seating
and lights for night games, but it would ‘
take a home run in 1960 to deﬁne the lega-
cy of the space.

“I was always a sports enthusiast,”
O’Brien said. “But one month after I ar-
rived at Pitt, the Pirates were playing the
Yankees in the World Series a block away
from my office in the Student Union.” In

 

game seven, second baseman Bill Maze-
roski hit a ninth inning home run to defeat
the New York Yankees in a come-from—be—
hind victory. I

“You couldn’t write a better story for the
ﬁnal game,” Madarasz said. “That became
a pinnacle moment in Pittsburgh’s history.
A decade later, the steel industry was in de-
cline and major changes started to happen
in Pittsburgh a-nd across the Midwest. That
stays a shining moment when Pittsburgh
was at the top.” The home run is still cel-
ebrated by a dedicated group of fans and
former players every year.

“Everything you want could be found in
Oakland,” O’Brien said. Pitt Stadium, locat-
ed where the Petersen Events Center sits
today, hosted a variety of events, including
Steelers games, concerts and speeches.

None of these structures would last for-
ever, though.

Forbes Field was torn down in 1970,
and the Pirates and Steelers moved to the

I North Side and Three Rivers Stadium. To-

day, a small baseball ﬁeld named in honor
of Mazeroski sits along Roberto Clemente
Drive, with only a few sections of the origi-
nal stadium’s gate and wall remaining.
Home base, which technically lies in
Posvar’s economics library, is recognized
with a facsimile under glass in the main

‘concourse of Posvar. I .

While stadiums and arenas may seem
like the most obvious professional sports
landmarks, a restaurant located where
Hemmingway’s Cafe now is brought pro-
fessional sports directly onto campus.
Frankie Gustine, a former inﬁelder for the
Pirates, opened the eatery after he retired.

“That restaurant was there for 30-some
years,” O’Brien said. Sports icons would
often meet in the restaurant, which had
walls lined with sports memorabilia, such
as Forbes Field’s lockers.

“Frankie Gustine himself was always
there, so Steelers and Pirates players went
there,” O’Brien said. They shared memo-
ries with colleagues and fans alike, which
is perhaps the greatest legacy of all these
sports centers.

“Place is important in terms of memory
and shared experience for a community,”
Madarasz said. “People came together and
shared something who otherwise might
not have ever been in the same place at the
same time.”

that the new plan might have a chance.
“So the next act that we had was The
Ramones. And obviously from there it just

— snowballed,” he said.

By the late ’7os the Iron City House-
rockers established a “residency” at the
club — playing two sets every Thursday
night — and a growing scene of musicians
and bar regulars soon emerged.

“Dominic had been looking for some-
thing like this to come along, but he had
no idea about the music stuff. He was an
older guy, his idea of rock ‘n’ roll was Dion
and the Belmonts. But he loved us and sup-
ported us,” Grushecky said.

That support stretched to other musi-
cians both locally and nationally as the
club’s size grew.

“He started hiring everybody and he
became like the Godfather of rock music.

Pretty soon the Decade had seven nights a_

week of great live music,” Grushecky said.

Before gaining a huge national popu-
larity, U2, The Police, The Pretenders and
Stevie Ray Vaughan each played sets at the
Decade during the late ’7os and ’80s.

DiSilvio personally convinced Ste-
vie Ray Vaughan to play at his club after
watching him perform live.

“Stevie Ray Vaughan was my favorite.
I saw him at a jazz fest in New Orleans. I
asked him if he would ever consider com-
ing north. He says, ‘We’ve never been fur-
thernorth than Georgia.’ I paid them $500
and they came all the way north and played
for $5oo,” he said.

Famous national artists like Aerosmith
and BonJovi visited the Decade after play-
ing shows at larger venues in the city be-
cause of its reputation. .

Even Bruce Springsteen stopped in af-
ter playing at the Civic Arena when Grush-
ecky took him on a tour of Oakland. ‘

“I even brought Bruce Springsteen there
one night during the height of the Born in
the U.S.A. craziness. Bruce and I went over
to the Original [Hot Dog Shop] and people
swarmed him. But we went overto Decade
and jammed with the band that was play-
ing,” Grushecky said.

Jeff Usleman recalled seeing bands at
the Oakland bar and catching the Spring-
steen cameo while attending Pitt in 1984.

“At the Decade, if you went a bit later,
there wouldn’t be a cover charge. You
could slide in and catch the band for the
price of a couple cocktails. The one night
I was there, Bruce Springsteen showed up
and played a couple songs,” he said.

Grushecky tied theprominence of Pitts-
burgh bands at the Decade to its mystique
and relevance.

“What made the Decade unique was
what made the Stone Pony unique in As-
bury Park — the local guys ruled. They
were noted for being great music bars.
They brought in outside acts all the time,
but still the local guys were the top dogs.
The Decade was legendary,” he said.

   

Electric Banana

If the Decade was Pittsburgh’s Stone
Pony, then the Electric Banana was Pitts-
burgh’s CBGB. »

The Electric Banana on Bigelow Boule-
vard was the smallest of the three Oakland
clubs and featured an Andy Warhol-style
banana sign above the entrance.

“The Decade was the antithesis of the
Electric Banana. Those guys were the
punk rockers and, for whatever reason,
those guys did not like the Decade bands,”
Grushecky said.

Johnny “Banana” Zarra owned the Ba-
nana with his wife Judy and decided in
1980 to make a radical transition in style

after nearly 10 years as a go—go and then
a disco club.

“Disco dropped dead. It was like turn-
ing the lights off. So we said, ‘What’s next?’
So we went rock ‘n’ roll,” Zarra said.

After booking a few cover bands, Zarra
took a chance on a Pittsburgh punk group
called Carsickness.

“I was walking past the bar one night,
and there was these two weird—looking
dudes all dressed in black. This guy, Karl
Mullen, wanted to book his band [Carsick-
ness]. So I was walking and talking at the
same time, so I told Judy, ‘Give these guys
a Monday‘ or Tuesday night.’ And I kept
walking.”

Zarra’s distracted booking of the band
ended up transforming the club’s direc-

PITT PROJEC OAKLAND+

tion.

“Monday came, and by the end of the
night there was 2 feet of beer cans on the
ﬂoor. At the end of it I thought, ‘This punk
isn’t bad,”’ he said.

The Electric Banana became the go-to
destination for these young punk bands.

“There wasn’t a club owner in the city
who would book, like, punk rock, new
wave. It was like the black sheep of rock ‘n’
roll,” Zarra said.

Nationally known punk and hardcore
bands started ﬁlling the Banana’s headlin-
ing spots. Inﬂuential bands from the era
such as Sonic Youth, the Minutemen, Op-
eration Ivy and Black Flag all played shows

Black Flag’s former singer still keeps in
touch with the Banana. “Henry Rollins still
sends us Christmas cards,” Zarra said.

The Decade and Electric Banana bands
rarely mixed, despite a shared hard—edged
sound.

The bands in the Decade scene were
older, more professionally skilled musi-
cians who played in a raw R8zB, rock-based
style. The Electric Banana featured more
college students and unrehearsed distor-
tion.

Grushecky noted a rivalry between the
two scenes sparked by these differences.

“We liked the punk attitude, but it
seemed so restrictive. There was a bit of a
competition between us, where the Elec-
tric Banana guys played the Banana and
the Decade guys played the Decade. The
Decade guys were deﬁnitely better musi-
cians — not better artists, but players,” he
said.

While playing in the band Mother Mc-
Cree’s Garden, Russ Schneider performed
at all three of the Oakland clubs in the mid-
’90s and described the Electric Banana as
a start—up venue.

“That was where everybody went to go
play ﬁrst. Because they would give a gig to
anybody,” he said.

Graﬂiti

The third club in the “Triangle” was
Graffiti, which opened on Baum Boulevard
in North Oakland in 1982.

Grafﬁti’s rough, brick—covered, ware-
house exterior contrasted with its spa-
cious lounge interior. Schneider saw Graf-
ﬁti as the most impressive of the Oakland
clubs.

“My preference was Graﬁiti, by far. It
was one of the better showcases that was
in Pittsburgh.‘That was a really nice place.

‘ The Decade had the most history, but it

was small,” he said. I
As a showcase club, Graffiti sought acts
from a wide spectrum of genres and young

musicians, featuring national acts while
still promoting local talent.

Graﬂiti featured concerts by national
groups just prior to their commercial
breakthroughs, including two of the more
popular rock bands of the ’9os. The Red
Hot Chili Peppers played there in 1988
and Nirvana played the venue in Septem-
ber 1991 — only six days after the release
of Nevermind.

The club also showcased and rewarded
Pittsburgh’s best talent in its own “Battle
of the Bands” competition called the Rock
Challenge.

“They always had the Rock Challenge,
which was big. ‘Rusted Root won it one year
and that’s how they recorded their ﬁrst
album. Because the prize was a recording
session at Audionation, which was a big
recording studio at the time,” Schneider
said. .

By drawing the musical talent of Pitts-
burgh together, Grafﬁti helped bands meet
and play with each other.

“That was the best part. We played
with, at the time, some really great bands
—— Blind Sight, The Goodies and Anti-Flag.
We would go to each other’s shows, but
we would also try and do shows with each
other,” Schneider said.

Beyond just beneﬁting the musicians,
Graffiti represented a dependable location
in Oakland at which to hear talented, rising
artists. “It was a place Where you could just
go and see who was playing this Saturday
 You knew you could hang out and enjoy
the good live music,” Schneider said. I

_MEN’S BASKETBALL

’ By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

With less than one second to go
in the game and the men’s basket-
ball team down by one point, head
coach Jamie Dixon called Lamar
Patterson’s number.

’ But it wouldn’t be a moment of .

heroics for the sophomore guard;
his game-winning attempt didn’t
fall, and the Panthers lost 67-66 in
the ﬁrst of a three—game champi-
onship series with the Washington
State Cougars.

The game was an appropriate
representation of the Panthers
season — one ﬁlled with streaks
of good and bad, both offensively
and defensively.

After surviving the ﬁrst round
of punches from the Panthers,
Washington State rode the strong
play of senior guard Abe Lodwick,
who scored 16 points on 6—of-12
shooting. Lodwick was coming off
back—to—back career nights and
continued to carry the Cougars as
their leading scorer.

Early on, the Panthers jumped
out to an 8-2 start. After the Cou-
gars rallied to take a 17-12 lead, the
Panthers came back even stronger
— going on a 13-0 run led by ].J.
Moore that put them ahead 25-17. It
would be the last timethe Panthers
had control over the game.

Washington State responded
to the run by calling a timeout.
From there, it began an 8-3 run
that took the game to 28-25, Pitt.
At that time, Washington State was
shooting 5-of-6 from the 3-point
line, a pace that seemed unrealistic
to maintain.

But the Cougars would keep
ﬁnding ways to score, and the Pan-
thers’ lead continued to diminish
at the start of the second half. After
his team played poor perimeter
defense in the ﬁrst 20 minutes,
Dixon recognized the Cougars’
strengths.

“They’re shooting the ball
well right now,” Dixon said to a
reporter before heading into the
locker room.

Unfortunately, it didn’t seem
like the Panthers defenders no-
ticed. After scoring on their ﬁrst
possession, Pitt left Lodwick —
arguably Washington State’s best
3-point shooter —— wide open on

the baseline to make it a 40-38 Pitt
lead. With 16:44 left in the game,
a DaVonte Lacy free throw put the
Cougars ahead 43-42, and they
never relinquished the lead.
After going ahead 60-48, an
11-2 Pitt run cut the Washington
State lead to 62-59. But when it
counted, the Panthers couldn’t
stop Lodwick, who responded with
a huge three to make it 65-59.
With 1:01 left, the Panthers be-

gan their ﬁnal push as Talib Zanna
turned a perfect pass from Lamar
Patterson into a 3-point play. His
free throw made it a two—point
game with one minute left.

But when Zanna got back to the
line 56 seconds later, he was only
able to hit one of two free throws,
and the Cougars clung to their one-
point lead. Lodwick rebounded
Zanna’s miss, was fouled and then

to open the door for the Panthers’
last-second opportunity.

With just less than four seconds
to play and down by one, Pitt tried
to get the ball into the hands of
Travon Woodall. The junior guard
covered the length of the ﬂoor be-
fore having his layup blocked out

set up Patterson’s last-second shot
attempt. _

ton Gibbs was essentially a non-
factor. The sharp shooting senior

BASEBALL

By Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

In the opening series of its Big East
schedule, the Pitt baseball team
played three errorless games and
outhit its opponent, the Notre
Dame Fighting Irish, 26-22. But
despite the statistical success, the
Panthers dropped all three games
in South Bend.

“That was a very difficult se-
ries,” head coachjoejordano said.
“We outhit them in two of the three
games and had some situations in
terms of hard hits that didn’t go
our way. I’ve really never experi-
enced anything like that before.
We played errorless baseball this
weekend, which was awesome. We
did a lot of good things against a

V‘ ' very good team, but, unfortunately,

we came up on the wrong side of
the scoreboard.”

Coming through with hits in
clutch situations was important to
surging Notre Dame to three wins
by two or fewer runs.

“Baseball is one sport in which
stats do not necessarily correlate
with wins and losses,” senior An-
thony Defabio said. “We swung the
bats well this weekend, but Notre
Dame had more timely hits than

‘ we did.”

The Panthers couldn’t get the
clutch hits that Notre Dame got
but showed some scoring produc-

tion over the weekend, and they
will look to grow from that as they
get deeper into their conference
schedule.

“Our issue right now is we have
yet to play our complete game,”
senior Rick Devereaux said. “Once
we ﬁnd a way to put it all together
and play the complete game, we
will see better end results.”

Pitt 5, Notre Dame 6

After two scoreless innings, Pitt
exploded for four runs in the third
inning of the Big East opener for
both squads.

The Panthers came through
with four big hits in the inning and
capitalized on a throwing error

that led to four unearned runs.

Senior lefty Matt Iannazzo was
pulled in the ﬁfth inning when he
encountered some trouble, giving
up four straight hits after striking
out the ﬁrst batter he faced.

Freshman Joe Harvey got the
team out of the jam, only allowing
one of the runs, credited to Ian-
nazzo, to score by striking out the
last two outs. After successfully
leaving behind the trouble in the
ﬁfth, he gavejordano two innings
of scoreless baseball.

In the eighth, Casey Roche
scored when Boo Vazquez doubled
to the left center gap to stretch the
lead to two runs. This was the only
other inning in which the Panthers

scored, and they failed to string
even two hits together in any in-
ning except for the fourth and
eighth.

“Our offensive philosophy is a
‘foot on the gas, don’t let up’ kind
of approach,” sophomore Derik
Wilson said. “Sometimes I feel like,
as an offensive unit, we sit back and
count on the pitchers once we get a
lead. We should keep pressing for
more run support.”

Notre Dame tied the game up in

the bottom of the inning with a big .

double and capped its comeback
with a walk—off solo home run in
the bottom of the ninth.

Pitt 2, Notre Dame 3

An exciting ﬁrst inning was all
the scoring that Saturday’s match-
up saw. Both pitchers struggled to
ﬁnd the plate early.

The Panthers got the hitting
started in the top of the ﬁrst in-
ning when Devereaux doubled to
score Defabio. Devereaux scored
himself on a throwing error later
in the inning to get the team’s only
two runs.

“The pitcher was able to settle
in, and we were unable to get him
on edge,” Devereaux said. “Our
pitchers did a great job settling in
after tough ﬁrst innings this week-
end as well.”

Sophomore Ethan Mildren
went all eight innings for Pitt, al-

lowing three runs on six hits with
six strikeouts.

“In the ﬁrst inning, I was miss-
ing up in the zone,” Mildren said. “I
caught myself trying to overthrow.
In between innings, I refocused

and made the adjustment. After

the ﬁrst, I had a great feel for all
of my pitches. I was able to keep
my pitch count down deep into the
game and did everythingl could to
keep our team in the game.”

The team made good contact
on the ball throughout the second
game but struggled to string two
hits together until the ninth.

“We hit the ball well in Game 2,”
Roche said. “It just so happened
we were hitting it right at guys. We
worry about what we can control.
We know there’s no excuse for not
scoring in any of those innings.”

The best chance Pitt had to tie
the game up came in the ninth.
With runners on ﬁrst and second
and down a run, Wilson connected
on a hard-hit ball to center ﬁeld
that was pulled in by the center-
ﬁelder to end the game.

Pitt 5, Notre Dame 7

Sophomore Matt Wotherspoon
struggled in his Big East debut this
season, going seven and two thirds
of an inning allowing seven runs on
only ﬁve hits.

The Fighting Irish started early,
with three runs on two hits in the

ﬁrst inning.

In the top of the second inning,
Pitt got two runs on four hits.
Roche doubled to start the inning
and later scored when freshman
Elvin Soto grounded out. The other
run came after junior Evan Oswald
doubled in junior Sam Parente.

Notre Dame got a run back in
the bottom of that inning. After
the second, Wotherspoon settled
in for ﬁve straight innings of no-
hit baseball.

Soto’s sixth-inning double
scored Vazquez, bringing the Pan-
thers within one run of the Irish
until the eighth.

With Wotherspoon still pitching
in the eighth inning, Notre Dame
connected on two doubles to bring
three runs across the plate.Junior
Kevin Johnson came in to record
the ﬁnal out for Pitt.

The Panthers plated two runs
in the top of the ninth, but still
fell two runs short of a late come-
back.

I Despite getting swept and dig-
ging a hole early in the season, the
Panthers feel that they executed
well over the weekend and look to
build on what they learned in the
three losses to the Irish.

“I look at those types of losses
as the best kind of losses, if there’s
such a thing,” Wilson said. “Know-
ing that you outplayed your op-
ponent is something for a team to
build on.” I

GRAIN OF SAUL

Bo1ton’sMuamba begins life after death 

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

It’s been just more than a week since Bol-
ton’s Fabrice Muamba’s heart stopped beat-

ing for 78 minutes on the soccer pitch last V

Sunday.

Muamba, who effectively died in the 42"‘
minute of the Football Association Cup quar-
terﬁnal soccer match between the Bolton

Wanderers and the Tottenham Hotspur, ‘is l"

in the early stages of a battle he’s familiar
with: the battle for life.

You see, Muamba isn’t just an ordinary
footballer. He didn’t growyup attending
camps and clinics, playing for youth clubs

and leagues. His life began in the Democratic V

Republic of Congo, where he fell asleep to
the sound of gunﬁre each night.

As he saw death on his street every day,
Muamba continued to practice soccer.
During one of Africa’s bloodiest civil wars,
there he was — kicking a little ball back
and forth. A T ,

Whenlhe arrived in Heathrow, England,
Muamba was a shivering 11-year-old boy
who couldn’t speak any English. He was
looking for his father, who had ﬂed their
home country years before to seek politi-
cal asylum in England, leaving Muamba to
live with his uncle, who would eventually
be killed.

12 years later, 23-year-old Muamba lay
facedown on the pitch. In thestands, fans
cried and embraced as Muamba’s body went
from seizing to lifeless. Players on both
teams collapsed in prayer, covered their
mouths and their eyes and held each other
for comfort.

White Hart Lane, the stadium that has
hosted soccer- matches since 1899, fell si-
lent.

Inthecrowd, one fan — Dr. Andrew
Deaner, a cardiologist —- couldn’t just sit
and watch. After persuading a ﬁeld steward-
ess to let him out of the stands and toward
Muamba, Deaner oversaw the CPR being
performed on the young athlete.

Then he got in the ambulance with
Muamba and followed him to the hospital
at which he worked. Deaner admitted there
was little he could do with the team’s trainers
and the emergency medical staff perform-
ing “very good CPR,” but he wasn’t about
to let things develop without his watchful
eye present. _

The medical staff on hand decided to take
Muamba to the London Chest Hospital, a
specialty facility. The trip took 48 minutes.
Once he arrived, Muamba went 30 minutes
in the hospital without his heart having a
muscular contraction. With no breath, no
heartbeat and no response, Muamba was
—— by all accounts -— dead.

Yet, hours later, when Muamba came
out of sedation and began breathing on his

own, the ﬁrst thing he asked his father was,
“Did we lose?” ' .

When his dad told him that officials had
stopped the game, Muamba was confused.

“Why?” he asked.

Why? Well, it’d probably have something
to do with the fact that Muamba had died
on the ﬁeld. To continue playing wasn’t even
a thought. _

“Because of you,” his dad reportedly told

 

P l Pi ogm ou

him. I
Now a week into his recovery, reports are
that Muamba is improving steadily. ESPN
has reported that Muamba is out of bed and
eatingand talking on his own. He is still in
intensive care, but his condition has been
upgraded to stable.
‘ On Tuesday night, the Wanderers and
Hotspur aresplanning to continue the game
that was called in a 1-1 draw. While the two

teams complete their game that was stopped
short, Muamba will continue his battle off
the ﬁeld with the same perseverance that
got him to England in the ﬁrst place.

And when each player and fan offers
Muamba a standing ovation during the pre-
game ceremony —-— as teams and fans have
been doing worldwide since Monday — we’ll
be reminded that a game of soccer isn’t that
serious after all. I
