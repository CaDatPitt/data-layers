Presbyterian Hospi

By llona Segedy
For The Pitt News

Presbyterian-University Hospital
plans to begin trials next year with a
prototype of a fully implantable
human heart—device. '

The new implantable pump,

known as an electrochemical ven- ‘

tricular assist device, would also be
used as a stopgap until a human heart
donor can be found. It represents the
next step in artificial heart develop-
ment, replacing current compressor-

driven devices with an electrically-

powered one. '
Presbyterian leads the world in the
number of heart transplants per-
formed and Jarvik artificial heart im-
plants. The Jarvik is used as a
temporary heart replacement until a
human donor could be located.
While Presbyterian has reported
excellent results with the Jarvik-7
heart device, the ventricular assist

device would give the hospital
another means of extending the lives
of patients needing transplants.

Dr. Bartley Griffith, one of the five
heart transplant surgeons at
Presbyterian, told the Pittsburgh Post-
Cazetfe that the biggest difference
between the ventricular assist and the
Jarvik-7 is the power source. Griffith
explained that th_e Jarvik is driven by
compressed air tubes that enter the
chest. The implantable ventricular
assist would avoid the need for open-
ings in the chest. Its electrical power
is supplied by. a coil strapped to the
chest.

Griffith said the coil on the chest
strap would transmit power to
another coil attached to the ven-
tricular assist device inside the chest.
The outer coil could be powered by
a cord plugged into an electrical
outlet. Eventually, battery packs may

provide enough power, thus enabl-'

ing patients with the ventricular assist

tal to test

device to leave their homes for up to
eight hours at a time.

According to Griffith, the other ma-
jor difference between the ventricular
assist and the Jarvik-7 is that the ven-
tricular assist device is sewn onto the
heart’s ventricles, leaving the heart's
own valves in place. The Jarvik-7 is

Student activities 
director position
will remain open 
until next spring 

By Jim Urban

Editor-in—Chief

Pitt Vice President for Student Af-
fairs Conney Kimbo said Friday he
does not expect to fill the vacant stu-
dent activities director position until
next spring.

Kimbo said he will extend the
deadline for applications but did not
offer a specific date.

The’ position has been open since
former director Wm. Andrew Smith
resigned to accept the position as
director of the Texas Union. Smith
left Pitt in favor of histnew job in the
University of Texas system on Aug.
15.

Currently, Smith's duties are being
split by two acting directors: Joyce
Giangarlo, who is in charge of the
student organizations, and Terrence
Milani, who is responsible for the
William_ Pitt Union.

According to Kimbo, the main
reason for the delay in naming
Smith's replacement is because his
office has been unusually busy due

to the University of Pittsburgh's-

Bicentennial Celebration.

He also said that Pitt was forced to
advertise the position at a bad time
of the year (late summer) and,

perhaps, highly qualified people

could not apply because they were
already committed to another school.

Smith accepted the job at Texas in
late July, gave notice of his impend-
ing resignation to Pitt officials and
was gone shortly after.

Both Giangarlo and Milani worked
"under Smith at Pitt. Milani was the
associate director of student activities
and Giangarlo was an assistant'direc-
tor. Kimbo said both are doing a
more-than-adequate job. He added
that Milani and Giangarlo’s effec-
tiveness is another reason why he is

in no hurry to name Smith's re-'

placement.

”Overa|| [Milani and Giangarlo]
have done a very good job. I am very
pleased with the work they are do-
ing,” said Kimbo. _

Both are believed to be among the

have suffered noticeable strokes.

MOSCOW —- The Soviets have ac-
cepted a U.S. attempt to restore order
in international relations and have
agreed to call a truce between the
two countries in the tit-for—tat expul-

A sions that have recently plagued the

superpowers.

Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander
Bessmertnykh called the Soviet
Union's retaliatory measures ”ade-
quate” and said they were based on
Washington conjectures that it was
a method of achieving diplomatic

equality.

So far, 80 Soviet diplomats have
been expelled from the United States
and 10 U.S. diplomats from the
Soviet Union. However, American
operations have been disrupted due
to the Kremlin mandate that 260
Soviet employees at the Moscow em-
bassy and consulate in Leningrad
forfeit their jobs.

This has forced diplomats to resort
to handling their own personal tasks,
like raking leaves, emptying trash
cans and driving themselves to work.

State Department spokesman Char-
les Redman offered the truce Thurs-

L . day, saying, ”We hope that this set

of issues can now be put behind us."

Aide who refused
lie test identified 7

WASHINGTON —- A National Se-
curity Council staff officer who re-
fused to take a polygraph test
concerning the disclosure of the
secret deception campaign by the
Reagan administration against Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi has been
identified as Elaine Morton.

Morton, an expert on Libya and
North Africa, told reporters that she
cooperated with the FBI investigation
to the point of allowing agents to
search her apartment, but refused the
lie detector test because she con-
sidered it a near invasion of her in-
tegrity. _

White House spokesman Larry
Speakes did not identify the woman
Friday, but described her as a veteran
State Department officer on loan to
NSC and said the employee offered
to return to the department after
refusing to take the test.

Britain severs
relations with Syria

DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa said
at a news conference Saturday that
Britain's charges that Syria was in-
volved in the attempt to blow up an
Israeli jet in London last April were

"unfounded."

Sharaa condemned Britain's deci-
sion to sever diplomatic relations
with Syria, while a state-run Damas-
cus radio said that London ’’will pay
dearly” for its anti-Arab policy.

Britain discontinued links with
Syria on Friday, three hours after a
London jury had convicted Jordanian
Nezar Hindawi of attempting to blow
up an El Al jetliner by concealing a
bomb in a bag, anticipating that his
Irish girlfriend would carry it onto the
flight.

Meanwhile, Israel is applauding
Britain's move, calling it a coura-
geous step against international ter-
rorism.

Happy

Roy Rogers enjoys a visit to Pitt

By Christopher Sepesy
Staff Writer

When E.F. Hutton talks, everyone
may listen, but when Roy Rogers
rode into town for Pitt's homecom-
ing, everyone cheered.

”The past few days have been ab-
solutely wonderful,” said Rogers. ’_’I
can't tell you how much fun I have
had here at this great college in this
great city.”

Rogers was chosen as grand mar-
shal of this year's homecoming
because of his extraordinary record
of good citizenship and humanitar-
ianism. Pitt President Wesley Posvar
said in his opening remarks that he
feels Rogers is ”a great American.”

Jack Rush, former two-time presi-
dent of RCANictor who has repre-
sented an astonishing array of stars,
is in his 45th year as Rogers’ personal
manager. He said Rogers is worthy
of being deemed ”great.”

”Roy has one of the greatest, most
phenomenal careers in entertain-
ment. ‘Match this with his deeply
rooted love and respect for America

and her people over the years, and

a wonderful family man and a true
friend. He really is an American
hero.”

Rogers commented on the fact that
he feels heis lucky to have had both
the career and the popularity he has
retained over the years. Born in Cin-
cinnati to a sizable family, he said he
did not have the chance students do
today. He said the school he attend-
ed was the school of ”hard knocks.”

In 1931, his family moved to
Southern California where Rogers
worked a variety of jobs, from shoe
salesman to migrant fruitpicker, un-

til he finally landed a position sing-.

ing and playing guitar for various
country-western groups on Los
Angeles radio.

In 1937, Republic Pictures an-
nounced they were looking for a
singing cowboy. Rogers auditioned

and got the role. The rest is history. ‘

By the end of 1938, Rogers, with his
beloved golden palomino, Trigger,
was well becoming the ”King of the
Cowboys.”

In 1947, Rogers married his love,

were inducted into the Cowboy Hall
of Fame. Also, they have been invited
to the White_House by five U.S. pres-
idents.

Rogers feels he has been very lucky
in both life and career, and that this
luck has crossed over to the populari-
ty he has had and has retained.

from the police

It looks as if problems with Pittsburgh’s police didn't go away with
the dismissal ofJohn Norton. The latest scandal brewing among the
boys in blue has to do with Police Chief Moore. He allegedly punched
another officer in the face for insubordination. Moore denies it, and

l the officer swears by his testimony. We'll just have to wait until the

hearing to find out exactly what happened.

Problems with police forces are nothing new. Right now, the cities
of New York and Boston are investigating corruption and general
abuse of power in their respective police forces. Pittsburgh’s troubles
pale in comparison to the aforementioned cities, but that's not to say
they're not legitimate concerns.

Corruption has always been a part of big—city life, but that doesn't

‘ make it any more acceptable. The hearing of the Moore incident will

be made public. This is very uncommon because it will be a hearing
conducted by the Pittsburgh Police. These meetings have always been
closed to the press in the past. Perhaps the lifting of the press—ban
is a sign from the police that they realize that there's a problem and
they are willing to do anything they can to make their operations more
effective and non-corrupt.

The bicentennial

was a grand time

Wow! What a week! The bicentennial/homecoming was everything
it was hyped up to be, if not more. It was refreshing and invigorating
to see students and administrators celebrate together. People were
actually proud to be connected to Pitt. Let's hope that that attitude
stays around for a while.

The Pitt News hadn't shown too much support of these activities
when they were in the planning stages. Some of the articles published
in our paper weren't the most enthusiastically pro-bicentennial. We ‘
still maintain those positions. But wow! What a week!

The parade and fireworks were incredible —- money well spent.
People came from all over the area to see what happened here last
‘Thursday. That could very well be the best part of this year's
homecoming. It wasn't just Pitt celebrating Pitt. It was the entire Pitts-
burgh community taking time to come to Oakland and celebrate the
bicentennial of the University of Pittsburgh.

Traffic jams and power outages did little to dampen spirits. A shanty
and a tasteless man with a bullhorn in the parade did even less. After
seeing the skies explode over Oakland, with the entire area watching,
how could anyone walk away from last week and not be moved and
feel pride in our university?

‘The committee behind the homecoming festivities is to be com-
mended. They did an exemplary job. They took their share of criticism
but remained undaunted. The Pitt News congratulates you on a job
well done.

But what good is a party when no one comes? The students and
the general public deserve some credit too. You were actually begin-
ning to show some real spirit. For one week, the University of Pitts-
burgh actually didn’t have an apathetic student body. Let's try to go
for a whole year now.

Homecomings are a celebration of history. They usually don't add
to it; they just remember it. This year was an exception, though. For
the first time in the history of this institution, a black man and woman
were elected homecoming king and queen. That is more cause for
celebration, and another affirmation that anyone can do anything he
or she sets out to do.

It's easy to be excited’ and proud when you find yourself under a
rocket’s red glare, when the band releases a million balloons during
halftime, or when the final score of a game is 56 to l4. The real test
is to keep that spirit alive — to keep your head high when the foot-
ball team is losing or when you don't care for the latest move made
by the board of trustees or when you are deluged with midterms and
papers. lt’s’ importantrthat we try to hold on to what we feltlast week.

A view from the inside

There's one thing we at the shantly
would like to say about Fridays
editorial.

Thank you.

From the headline to the closing
sentence, the editorial made many
valid points about the shanty and its
effect on the bicentennial weekend
at Pitt. In doing so, it encouraged
people to think about South Africa
and perhaps even to come and talk
to us about the complex issue of apar-
theid and divestment. And that's a big
part of why the shanty exists.

The headline screamed that the
shanty is a tasteless display. We
couldn't agree more. Our shack was

. built to symbolize the suffering en-

dured by many blacks under the
racist apartheid system — a truly
tasteless and utterly abhorrent system
of government by genocide. To a de-
gree, we are sorry if our structure
seems tasteless, but we were only
matching the symbol to the problem.

The opening arguments of the edi-
torial said that it's a shame the shan-

God said: ”Let there be bars, liquor
stores and the ‘O’ in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
so that there can eventually be Beer
Wars throughout the land.” And so
it was. Evening came, and morning
came: the first day.

God said, "Let there be paranoid
IFC members and university ad-
ministration officials so that the im-
portance of drinking and debauchery
may be multiplied and spread to
those not yet exposed to it.” And
then God said: “Let there also be
angry fraternity brothers who, in
response to the IFC and the universi-
ty administration, further the

‘multiplication of the importance of

drinking and debauchery by express-
ing a burning desire to havegit when
they are around others." Evening
came, and morning came: the second
day.

V God said, “Let the owners of the
bars, liquor stores and the ‘O’ in Pitts-
burgh, Pa., see the opportunity to

tiplication of the importance of drink-
ing and debauchery and begin Beer

ty was built and that the shanty is
uncalled-for. Another argument sug-

gests that the number of past oppor-
tunities to express disgust with
university policy renders our choice
of erecting the shanty for the bicen-
tennial weekend inappropriate.

It is a terrible shame that we had
to resort to what might seem to be an
uncalled-for tactic. But our tactic was
no more inappropriate than the board
of trustees’ continuing practice of ig-
noring student and faculty expression
of disgust on the issue of divestment.
It is precisely because we have had
so many opportunities to express our
disgust and used the opportunities to
no avail, that a shameful or uncalled-
for display became necessary.

The editorial also said the shanty
detracted from the bicentennial
celebration and was not part of a

show of pride or enthusiasm for our
school. Actually, it is because we
have pride in our school and are en-
thusiastic about what it can achieve
(but has failed to achieve) that we are
here. It is because we want what we
feel is best for our school and for the
world community that we give up
our comfortable acquiescence to the
status quo and sleep in a makeshift
shack. It is. because we want our
degrees to stand not for profits and
collaboration with genocide, but for
humanity, dignity and self—respect
that we spend days and nights out-
doors in bad weather.

In fact, it is when the board of
trustees shows enough pride in Pitt
to let its students and faculty vote on
the issue, or when it shows an en-
thusiasm for integrity by choosing to
dissociate with oppression and
murder that we will discontinue our
“tasteless display.”

Wars.” And so it was. The Universi-
ty Beverage Center made its prices

lower so that people would buy from '

them instead of anyone else. And the
"O” in Pittsburgh, Pa., sold beer from
throughout the land so that people
would buy from them instead of
anyone else. Evening came, and
morning came: the third day.

God said, "Let there be somewhat
paranoid people in the world who
come with the slogan ‘alcohol
bewareness’ so that some people
might say, ‘What is this alcohol thing?
Maybe I should give it a try,’ so that
drinking and debauchery becomes
even more popular in the world.”
And so it was. Because paranoid peo-
ple came with the slogan "alcohol
bewareness," drinking and debauch-
ery became even more popular in the
world. Evening came, and morning
came: the fourth day.

God said, “And then let the owners
of the bars, liquor stores and,the ‘O’
in Pittsburgh, Pa., see that more peo-
ple are interested in drinking and

debauchery and intensify the Beer
Wars.” And then God said: ”Let them
lower their prices further because of
the paranoid IFC members, adminis-
tration officals and other people who
came with the slogan ‘alcohol be-
wareness,’ so that drinking and
debauchery is much more accessible
to those people, old and new, who
desire it.” Evening came, and morn-
ing came: the fifth day.

God said, “Let the people involved
in_the Beer Wars invent the howitzer
so that the Beer Wars can be inten-
sified even further. And let the inten-
sification of the Beer Wars result in
even further multiplication of the im-
portance of drinking and debauchery
so that even more people will be in-
terested in it.” And so it was. Evening
came, and morning came: the sixth
day.

And God looked down on what he
had created, and he saw that it was
very bad. He said, ‘‘I should have
rriade a world’ where people don't
see drinking and debauchery as such
a bad thing, and words like ‘alcohol,’
‘morality’ and ‘debauchery’ have dif-
ferent, less severe, meanings." So
God destroyed the earth and started
over. He said, ”Let there be light,”
and there was light.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 27, I986

 

Big Brothers provide needed leadership-

I received a request from a local
chapter of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of
America; the chapter said that there
was a shortage of big brothers and
sisters and that children were on a
waiting list. Would I help ask for
volunteers?

My initial reaction was no, and
that, as much as anything else, tells
you how screwed up our world is be-
coming.

My first reaction was no because,

. like the rest of you, I have read so

many news stories about child abuse’
and crimes against children. My first
thought was that to make a public ap-
peal for adults to develop one-on-one
relationships with children would be
to invite the wrong kinds of adults to
phone in. '

I didn't want to be responsible for
that. So I decided against doing the
story.

But then I thought- about it, and
that's when I realized what an un-
trusting age we are beginning to live
in. If you can't even endorse Big
Brothers/Big Sisters of America, what
have we come to? ’

Fundamentalists get away

It looks like the Reagan Justice
Department has something in com-
mon with Nazi Germany — they
both have something against Anne
Frank.

A group of fundamentalist Chris-
tians in Tennessee sued a private
school where their children are
enrolled on the grounds that selec-
tions in a Holt, Rinehart and Winston
reading book offend their religious
convictions. They won. Not only
that, but they are scheduled to
receive monetary damages.

Needless to say, civil rights organ-
izations across the country are fum-
ing about the matter and are
appealing the case.

The parents cited The Wizard of
Oz by Frank Baum, The Diary of
Anne Frank and material by Margaret
Mead and Hans Christian Anderson
as offensive, and they refused to let
their children read them.

The parents claimed the literature
teaches themes such as feminism and

' witchcraft, which they find to be in-

congruent to their Christian beliefs.

”Ifonly I

Philip Moyer promises to make
Oakland safe if elected SGB presi-
dent. Jay Rothstein claims he will do
something about the current campus
housing shortage. Both say they can
get the 5GB to force the Pitt-ad-
ministration to completely divest
from South Africa.

SGB presidential candidates, let's
be realistic here. C

Can Moyer single-handedly patrol
the streets of Oakland (perhaps with
his marauding band of SGB members
armed to the teeth with deadly stu-

dent activity allocation request forms) _

and protect Pitt students from restless
inner-city youths and vicious alley
muggers? Will Rothstein convince
the administration to build six more
Litchfield Towers with their claustro-
phobic wedge-shaped rooms? Do
Moyer and Rothstein truly believe
that they can change the Pitt board
of trustees’ minds about divesting
from South Africa by more or less get-
ting on their knees in front of Wesley
Posvar and whining ”P|eeeeeeease!”
long enough?

I don't think so.

Disgusted with how SGB presi-
dents drown in the seas of university
bureaucracy and repeatedly fail to re-

I got in touch with the organi-
zation's national headquarters in
Philadelphia and spoke witli an ex-
ecutive there named Diane Stratton.

”The goal of Big Brothers/Big
Sisters is what it has always been,”
Stratton said. ”We try to provide
adult companionship and leadership
for children who otherwise wouldn't
get it.”

Most of the children who want to
take part in the Big Brothers/Big
Sisters programs come from one-
parent families. The idea is that a
volunteer adult becomes a big
brother or sister to one of these
children and devotes between two
and six hours a week to the child. The
big brother or sister does not become
a surrogate parent; he or she simply
becomes a friend. 5

Big Brothers/Big Sisters has been
functioning for more than 80 years.
There are currently some 465 Big
Brother/Big Sister agencies in the
United States. Approximately 85,000
children are involved.

In most areas of the country, there
are waiting lists — children who

Considering that I have read most
of the material they are damning, I
find it absolutely disgusting, appall-
ing, morally outraging and plain
stupid that someone would feel that
way — I mean, that a judge would
be convinced enough to award them
the case.

I am not at all outraged by the fact
that the parents were upset and
wanted to let their children know that
the books’ content was not agreeable
with their faith. That is their right.

However, to propose that forcing
the children to read the material is an
infringement on their constitutional
rights seems backwards to me.

Let me explain.

I think the key word is teach. The
parents claimed (and the judge
bought it hook, line and sinker) that
their children were being taught
these disgraceful ideologies.

It may be more correct to say they
were being taught to read. Admitted-
ly and obviously, everything from

in your backyard have an influence

emerge with bold and exciting new
ideas and plans for the student body,
I wish to nominate a new SGB presi-
dential -candidate for this election: a
man crazy enough to take on the job
of SOB president, a lad with bright
ideas as well as the fierce stubborn-
ness and sandpaperish personality to
do what it takes to take care of the
truly pressing problems facing Pitt
students, a man who if elected SGB
president would never scream pro-

fanities at The Pitt News Perspective E

candidate. ’

Who is this politicking nutcase?
Me!

Yes! If elected SGB president, I
swear to God (I'm certain he's on my
side) I would work hard for my fellow
undergraduates.

would love to have an adult big

brother or sister, but who are told that

there are not enough volunteers to go
around. '

The need is clearly there. Yet there
is that nagging question: With the
headlines today being what they are,
is it safe to ask for adult volunteers
to spend time alone with children
they have never met before?

Here is what Stratton had to say

FRANCES
SANSIG

on you. But ignoring something isn't
going to make it disappear.

To read is to understand. It is to be
exposed to, to be made aware of, to
analyze and to make you think.

True freedom lies not in the abili-
ty to force the enactment of legisla-
tion that permits a parent to prohibit
his child from reading classic litera-
ture, but in letting that child and that
parent have the option of accepting
or rejecting the ideals presented in
such material.

With logic such as Judge Hu||’s, it
would not be erroneous to assume
that eventually parents would be
granted the right to totally withdraw
their children from the American
educational system and instruct from
the home.

about that:

”We have an intensive screening
procedure which we use with volun-
teers. Unfortunately, it is the sensa-
tional crime stories that sell papers,
and nobody ever puts it on page one
when things work out all right. Before
a volunteer big brother or sister is
matched with a child, he or she must
come in to the agency and complete
an application and talk with us. We
require that references be given, and
the references are checked out. A
professional case worker interviews
each applicant. We pay a visit to the
applicant's home to evaluate the en-
vironment there. Many agencies also

do a police check on each app|i- I

cant.”

Indeed, on the brochures that are
given to potential big brothers and
sisters, there'is this paragraph:

”After you call to volunteer for the
[Big Brothers/Big Sisters] program,
you may be surprised at the depth of

our screening process and orienta-
tion. We're not trying to eliminate 1

you. It's just that the intensity of our
concern and love for these children
makes us awfully careful about how

we make our matches. We want to_
take the time to get to know you so 
that we can match you with the right .

child, one whose interests and per-
sonality will blend with yours. And
we want to make sure that you're
prepared to meet our one main re-
quirement — a minimum one-year's

commitment to the friendship. The .
relationship will take time to grow, .
and may, of course, go on for years.” V

The mandate of Big Brothers/Big
Sisters is simple: to help children who
may be lonely and isolated learn that
there is an adult out there who cares
and who will be on hand at least
once a week to provide friendship
and guidance. I

"We're not looking for people to
be Santa Claus,” said Stratton.
”We’re just looking for men and
womenwho have the kindness with-
in themselves to offer‘ something
even more valuable than money -
to offer their time.” .

There are Big Brother/Big Sister
agencies in communities all over the

United States. If you are interested -in g

being a volunteer, the agencies are
listed in the phone book. '

with too much

What is offensive? What is ob-
scene? What is permissible? These
are all difficult questions to answer.
For example, I'm sure most of us
have read about the 17-year-old
female who was offended by a hand-
out with sexually explicit pictures
and proceeded to inform the police.

Why didn't the girl simply throw the
handout away and tell the person
who gave it toher she thought it was
disgusting and be done with it?

What makes a nude photograph
more obscene than one of those
religious groupies who are always
trying to get you to attend their ser-
vices? Mind you, these people are not
the easiest people in the world to tell
you're not interested.

I have been confronted by these
people as many as four times in one
evening. It makes going out for an ice
cream cone on a Friday night hellish,
if you'll excuse the expression. '

However, I respect their right to
confront me, and I respect their right
to ask me to join their church, and
I even think it's OK if these guys are
a little persistent. As long as I can

agree or disagree with what they're
telling me, that's all that matters.

" Same thing with Hail Mary, the
avant—garde movie that is supposed-

ly sacreligious. Pittsburgh Catholics '

congregated in protest outside the
Fulton Theater in an attempt to pres-
sure management to ban the movie.

Did they see the movie? I know I
wanted to see it just out of curiousi—
ty after all that hoopla. Did they
achieve their goal? ’

Did these parents ever read Anne
Frank? The Wizard of Oz? I'd be will-
ing to bet they hadn't.

The Reagan administration is ob-
viously geared toward the protection
of religious beliefs. What about per-
sonal, political and humanitarian
convictions?

I am personally offended by Judge
Hul|’s decision.

to their heads. -
My next act, to solve Pitt's parking
problem, is to turn all of South
Oakland into one giant parking lot.
That move will also take care of most
everyone’s landlord-tenant problems.

As SGB president, I will spread
rumors throughout Oakland that
Napoli Pizza is dropping their price
down to $2.75, thus starting up the
good ol’ Pizza Wars again. Capri,
upon hearing that rumor, is bound to
drop its price to $2.50 for a large pie

_plus two free liters of Coke, just like

in the old days.

To resolve the South African divest-
ment situation, the SGB and I will
lead Pitt's board of directors into the
Cathedral of Learning’s Babcock
Room (up on the 40th floor) with the
story that Ronald Reagan is waiting
up there to talk about Republican
ideologies with them, and then bar-
ricade all exits from the room until
they all suddenly have a change of
heart about the Sullivan Principles.

, To encourage the board to make its

decision, we will pipe WPTS into the
room at full volume._ WPTS, of
course, will hold a Violent Femmes
and the best of Frank Zappa’s anti-
apartheidsongs marathon that will
last until every last penny belonging
to Pitt is out of theltip of Africa.

As SGB president, I will personal-
'ly do everything in my power to pre-
vent freshmen from smuggling alco-
hol into the Towers. Any frosh, after
a body search and dogsniffing in-
spection at the security doors, caught
with illegal alcoholic contraband will
be shot immediately on the spot and
mailed C.O.D. back to their parents.
Why? Because when I was a fresh-
man my"R.A. never let our floor keep
booze. So why should any other
freshman enjoy getting away with it?
Hey, I'm the SGB president. I can
legislate stuff like that, right?

Finally, don't you need a break
from your studies right after mid-
terms? I sure do. That's why as SGB
president I will fight until I'm black
and blue link from all the bureau-
cratic paperwork I will work through)
and have produced a two-week
spring break for everyone next winter
semester. The SGB will also sponsor
free, chartered Boeing 747 transpor-
tation direct to Ft. Lauderdale for

those two weeks so that Pitt students '

can join in all the chaotic fun in that
wonderful, adolescent beachland
war zone. I

_So remember to vote at this elec-
tion. And vote for me! Don't you
want a president in office who would
bring some life to the SGB? .

Divestment ca npaign moves to ’shanty’ outsideunion

By Dirk Kaufman
Managing Editor

Standing alone, it looks like a
clubhouse built by young boys. It
would seem to be a place to flip
baseball cards, store comic books
and hide the charter of a secret club.

It would seem to be a good place
for boys to become blood brothers —
cutting their thumbs with a Tom Mix
knife and holding those thumbs
together while reciting a secret pact.

The boys would call it ”The
Hideout," or ”Our Shack.” Across
the door there might be a skull and
crossbones with the words ”ENTER
AT YOUR OWN RISK,” crudely
painted with supplies taken from the
family garage.

For the occupants of this clubhouse
the blood is real. They have a sheet
across the side declaring, ”PITT,
THERE IS BLOOD ON YOUR PORT-
FOLIO."

The persons who run the club-

sation.

No comic books here, though. The
subject is divestment.

For many, the subject has gotten
old. It has become a cliche.

So, who put it up? What do they
hope to accomplish?

They call the shanty, Nelson
Mandela Hall.

’’I want to be proud of being a stu-
dent at the University of Pittsburgh,”
said Mark Lance, a 27-year-old
graduate student in the philosophy
department.

”But there is an ugliness about this
university, caused by its policy on
divestment. What this shanty does is
make that ugliness physical.”

Brian Ruyle, 24, is a student of law.

”Our being here is not a‘ statement
that we're better than anyone else,”
he said. ”We want anyone who stops

AI celebrates 25th

By Maria Ritz
Staff Writer

Members of Amnesty International,
a worldwide organization working
for the rights of political prisoners,
gathered to celebrate its 25th anniver-
sa,ry Saturday night.

To date AI has made efforts to free
30,000 prisoners from around the
world. AI has been successful in
releasing captives in over 25,000
cases.

Pittsburgh Group 39 and South
Hills Group 345 met at the Frick Fine
Arts building to listen to first-hand ac-

counts of imprisonment and torture.
Alicia Partnoy of Argentina, author of
The Little School, had been a youth
activist recording the junta’s human
rights violations when she was taken
from her apartment by armed
soldiers.

Partnoy‘ was held for five months
at a junta concentration camp. She
explained, ”I was blindfolded and
handcuffed for three months and later
spent ?_‘/2 years in jail.”

She received a visa from the
Organization of American States and
fled to Seattle. She said, ”Amnesty
helped me with medical and
psychological checkups. My story

say, ’I admire what you're doing, but
I don't agree with it,’ and that's fine.

”I’ll be the first to admit that I feel
like an anachronism sometimes. But
I could be doing a hundred million
other things. I'm here because I
believe what we're doing is impor-
tant.”

Tendayi Mundawarara’s parents
live in Zimbabwe. He came from
George Washington University to
Pitt's Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs. '

He said the country from which he
came would not be what it is without
revolution. He fears what will hap-
pen when what he calls an ”in-
evitable” revolution occurs in South
Africa.

The people gathered Saturday night
for the stay until Sunday morning said
they were not there expecting to
change the policy in South Africa.
Their intention is to end Pitt's finan-
cial involvement in the economic
process of the government, and to
make members of the university com-

year of fighting for

had a happy ending, but so many did
not. Most of my friends were killed.
I wrote an optimistic book with the
purpose of working to stop torture.”

Viktor Davydov, a second speaker
at the celebration, was arrested and
charged with working against the in-
terests of the Soviet state when Soviet
police searched his apartment and
found ”subversive” books and his
political writings. He was confined to
a psychiatric ”hospital" and labeled
schizophrenic.

Davydov explained, ”In the
Siberian prison I was struck by the
obviously starving people with their
tattered clothes and frozen eyes. All

munity more aware of what is occur-
ring there and why that means

something to the people in this com-'

munity.

”I think wherever I would happen
to be, I'd work for the freedom of
blacks in South Africa," said Mun-
dawarara. ”I happento be at Pitt. You
have to work through the institution
you have access to.”

The people there Saturday night
did not agree with the slogans that
had been used at times in the past.
Some of the slogans accuse Pitt Presi-
dent Wesley Posvar of genocide. In
recent weeks, Posvar has spoken out
against the slogans. _

”Those who accuse us of genocide,
or even of ill will, are either
outrageously malicious, or they sim-
ply aren't looking at the facts,” he
said.

Posvar and other members of the
administration have said that by
holding onto-investments in com-
panies based in South Africa, the
university maintains influence on the

drug in tablet form. When I had to
take them, I couldn't read or concen-
trate on anything.”

After being confined several
months in Kazan, Davydov was
moved to a psychiatric hospital,
formerly a prison, near the Chinese
border.

”Then suddenly I was freed for no
reason. I later learned that a West
German Amnesty group had been
writing letters on my behalf. I was the
only prisoner known in the West, so
they let me go.”

A year after his release Davydov
was summoned to Moscow where he

”What’s he doing with that in-
fluence?” said'Mundawarara. ”He’s
talking about having the chips in
South Africa when we aren't cashing
them in."

”I’m sure the stress on him is pret-

ty severe,” said Ruyle. ”There have ‘
_got to be limits.”

The students said the possible
damage the university might incur
through divestment would be worth
the risk. .

If people believe otherwise, Lance
said, ”the university is no longer serv-
ing an academic function but be-
comes a corporation.”

The students said they will remain
at the shanty until the school divests.
They aren't sure what they will do
when the weather ‘gets colder, but
they hope to keep the movement
going.

”I have to be here,” Donald Porter
said soon after arriving at the shanty
to spend the night.

Former education secretary
criticizes teaching methods

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

Former Secretary of Education Ter-
rel Bell disclosed his most recent
findings in the aftermath of a report
issued in 1983 entitled ”A Nation at
Risk." Bell gave a lecture at the
School of Education in memory of
Horace Mann, often called the
”father of the American public school
system.”

The report cited the spiraling de-
cline in the quality of education in
America and triggered a nationwide
crusade for reformation of the system.

”A Nation at Risk” reported, ”Our
once unchallenged pre-eminence 
is being overtaken by competitors
throughout the world.”

However, Bell said that the report
only covers one dimension of the
problem, and that while we can take
justifiable pride in our educational
system, it is being threatened by
mediocrity.

”We have witnessed [since the‘

release of the report] a nationwide

It's your if

 

move to reform and review educa-
tion,” said Bell. ”The nationwide
resolve has persisted for three years.”
Bell said that there is a definite void
in our educational techniques, name-
ly, the lack of excellence. .
”There are 23 million adults func-

tionally illiterate. Twenty—nine per-

cent of ninth graders in the United
States drop out of high school. Youth
unemployment is the highest unem-
ployment in America, especially
among minorities,” said Bell.

A survey that was conducted dur-
ing the time of the report, according
to Bell, revealed that over half of the
students in the teachers education
program scored in the bottom_25 per-
cent on college entrance exams.

Also, he said that the lack of
momentum in American competition
in areas such as international com-
merce and trade reflect the overall
predicament of the nation.

”We have lost the competitive
edge we once enjoyed in this area,”
said Bell, referring to the city of Pitts-
burgh. ”And many of our programs
have been unsuccessful because they

create dependency rather -than in-
dependency.”

The farming industry is one exam-
ple of the programs suffering under
these deficient conditions, according
to Bell. To fight these anti-progressive
climates, he suggests that we must
obtain ”dynamic, aggressive, charis-
matic leadership.”

There are 47 different provisions
recommended in ”A Nation at Risk.”
Of these, Pennsylvania has enacted
12, including the no-pass, no-play

rule. Bell said standards have already

been raised in 41 states.

Bell attributed the more stringent
educational requirements in those
respective states to assertive
governors.

”We urgently need leadership and
advocacy in education,” said Bell.
”We need to make school boards
more effective and courageous.

”The future is going to belong to
the intelligent,’’ said Bell, stressing
that the key to the resolution of this
seemingly retroactive situation is de-
veloping human intelligence.

Pitt posts homecoming victory against Navy,

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer ‘

It was fun to watch. Every once in
a while, a team needs to just go out
and thrash somebody — a lesser op-
ponent, that is. lt’s a way for players

to relieve tensions, have a good time

and set a few records in doing so. On
Saturday the Panthers did just that to
the Naval _Academy.

Of course, the star of this 56-14
gridiron extravaganza was Pitt
quarterback John Congemi. All this
young man happened to do was snap
the Panther .single—game passing
record with a wonderful 446 yards,
outdistancing Matt Cavana_ugh’s
1977 Gator Bowl performance by 59.
Granted, the Naval Academy's pass
defense isn't all that stingy, but Con-
gemi took what the defense gave
him, and them some. His ability to
find the open men — and there were
plenty of them — yielded incredible
final statistics: 43 attempts, 30 com-
pletions (a 70-percent completion
ratio), five touchdowns and no in-

terceptions. No matter who the op-
ponent is, that is a dream game for
any quarterback. .

”The line gave me a lot of time,”
said Congemi, ”and the receivers ran
well after the catch. They were ex-
plosive. We thought we could throw
the ball against Navy, and that was
our game plan all week. They came
out in the exact defense we sus-
pected, and we used some of the
mismatches to our advantage.”

And there were plenty of them.
Nine different Panthers were the
targets of Congemi passes, particular-
ly Keith Tinsley, who made nine
grabs for 157 yards and three
touchdowns.

Now where did this Tinsley guy
come from? Midshipmen skipper
Gary Tranquill had to wonder. Said
Pitt coach Mike Gottfried of the
defensive back-turned-receptionist, ’’I
think Keith's performance is an in-
dication that he's been in the offense
for a while. We feel he's really im-
proving now. He's an integral part of
our offense now. His learning
period is over.” Prior to the Navy

game, Tinsley’s total output was a
meager seven catches for 92 yards.

‘ How's that for keeping secrets from

the government? _

Pitt took the opening kickoff and,
with a full head of steam, flew upfield
on the strength of Congemi’s arm.
Nine plays and 77 yards later, the
Panthers were in the end zone on a
loft to Tinsley. And the rout was on.

Well, not quite yet. Bill Byrne,
Navy's highly touted quarterback,’
countered with a take-that drive to
knot the score at seven a piece. Mix-_
ing passes with runs by their fine
tailback Chuck Smith, Navy moved
at will on the visibly confused Pan-
thers. Said Gottfr-ied, ”Early in the
ballgame we were really in for a fight.
Our offense seemed ready to go, but
defensively we were slow out of the
gate. They showed us some different
formations on offense, and we were
slow to adjust. They did some things
that Temple did against us, like three
wide receivers to one side.”

The 45,345 fans on hand were
thinking deja-vu. The Temple Owls
had done the same in scoring early

4.

 

 

on Pitt, then proceeded to topple the
Panthers on that miserable evening.
Another upset loss here, and Pitt's
bowl chances were flushed.
OK, folks. Now the rout was on.
Pitt's Top i0 defense kamikazeed
any Midshipmen offensive, allowing

only a blown 40-yard field goal at-'

tempt midway through the second
quarter. From then on, the Middies
never threatened, as the Panther
defense yielded only 191 total yards
in the contest. '

At‘ the 9:30 mark of the third
quarter, Pitt built themselves a com-
fortable 28-7 lead when Congemi hit

a streaking Tinsley on the left sideline ‘

for his fourth TD pass. But by now
the defense was getting bored with
their quarterback stealing the show.
”Hey,” they thought, ”we’re stuffing
these Middies on every series. It's get-
ting kinda monotonous out there.
Let's put on a little side show and
liven things up a bit!”

Jerry Olsavsky was the first to per-
form. The linebacker‘ from Youngs-
town, Oh., snagged a tipped Byrne

pass. He said, f/[I] tried to get to the

\

sidelines as fast as I could. The bal-l
was in the air for what seemed like
an eternity before I caught it.” He.
weaved his way upfield, picking up
blocks from Tony Siragusa, Steve

Apke and Jon Carter before trudging —

into the end zone. Oslavsky then
celebrated with his newly patented
”herky-jerk bellyflop” spike-’,
something never before witnessed. by
modern man. ”That just cametfrom‘
the excitement,” he admitted. ’-’I-

thought I'd run out of gas and did_n’t. 7‘ H

think I'd make it.” ‘_
Then Billy Owens, playing his"

strongside copycat position, ‘picked 1

off the very next Navy pass attempt
and sliced 46 yards untouched for

another score. Time elapsed between

the two touchdowns: 51 whole

seconds. The score was now 42-7, —

Yet Congemi wasn't quite finished
with his day's work. The fifth-year
senior took over at his own 33 and,
five pass plays later, Gladman was
cradling the football in the end zone.

' If there were any doubters Satur-
day, there are certainly none today.
There can be no question now that
Keith Tinsley has found a home at
wide receiver after playing his entire
career at defensive back.

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried moved
Tinsley to wide receiver to help at a

* position which the Panthers are very
thin at. That move is paying more
dividends every week.

Against Navy, Tinsley put forth his
best effort yet as a wideout, catching
nine passes for 157 yards and three
touchdowns.

That performance surpassed his
numbers from all his previous games.
Going into the Navy game,>Tinsley
had seven catches for 92 yards.

‘By John Enright

Sports Editor

Quarterback John Congemi’s per-

formance in Saturday's win over

.Navy was his best game ever sta-
tistically (30 completions in 43 at-
tempts for 446 yards and five
touchdowns), yet he didn't feel it was
the best he's played at Pitt.

’’I thought the game against North
Carolina State this year was my best
day ever. I felt very sharp in that
game,” said Congemi.

”He’s going to get better all the
time,” said Gottfried. ”There’s
nothing we do now that Tinsley
doesn't know."

Tinsley, however, gave the credit
not to his increased understanding of
Gottfried’s complex run-and—shoot of-
fense but to John Congemi.

”He’s great,” Tinsley said of Con-
gemi. ”John works hard and it pays
off. He is finally coming into his own.
He's making the perfect reads and
finding the guy who gets open.”

And quite often the guy who got
open against Navy was Tinsley.
Sneaking in behind the coverage was
Tinsley’s modus operandi on Satur-
day. The Navy secondary seemed
baffled by his patterns and Congemi
knew it.

”Keith just makes the offense that
much more exciting,” Congemi said.

claims 446-yard gamewasn’t his best

Despite his performance, Congemi
refused to take all the credit. ”The
receivers and linemen deserve a lot
of credit. if it weren't for them, I
wouldn't have had such a big day.”

0 The play of Navy tailback Chuck
Smith caught the eye of Pitt coach
Mike Gottfried. Smith,- a junior,
rushed for 89 yards on 18 carries, not
exactly overwelming stats. Yet, his
style of running and strength was im-
pressive. ’’l have a lot of respect for
Smith. He compares very favorably
to Paul Palmer of Temple (a

’’It’s not just that he catches the ball
but what he does after he catches it.
All our receivers are like that. You
can't mention one without the
others.”

Congemi, when asked why Tinsley
was so successful against the Navy
defense said, ’’I think they were try-
ing to guess what he was going to do,
instead of just covering him.”

Navy guessed wrong most of the
time.

Tinsley has been seeing more play-
ing time. As the season progresses,
he has learned more of the offense,
but according to him, he is not yet
all the way there.

”There are still some things I need

to work on,” Tinsley said. ’’I have a .

tendency to relax my hands, being a
new receiver. But now, I'm concen-
trating on watching the ball all the
way-into my hands.”

Tinsley added that this season was
not the first time a coach thought of
him as a wide receiver. He men-
tioned that last year Foge Fazio said
that perhaps Tinsley would be better
suited as a wide receiver. That
change was never made, and Tinsley
remained a defensive back until last
month.

But don't get the wrong idea, he
never actually minded playing
defense. ’ ‘

’’I don't regret not moving to wide
receiver earlier,” he said. ’’I liked
playing cornerback. it was a good ex-
perience.”

There are also good things about
being on the offense, things which
have not escaped Tinsley’s notice.

said a few weeks ago. ”Now when-
ever I busta coverage it means we

Owens, a former running back,
also returned a pass for a touchdown
against Purdue earlier in the season.
His experience as a running back has
been very evident in both touchdown
returns. Sometimes, Owens isn't so
sure he's playing the right position.
’’I like to run the football,” said
Owens.

Tinsley catching on as wide receiver

When Gottfried made the move,
he said it was because he knew
Tinsley had good hands and there
was nobody else he could move in
at wide receiver.

Tinsley was not entirely unfamiliar
with the position. He was a tailback-
flanker on his high school team in
Detroit. «

In the end, however, the move to
wide receiver may benefit Tinsley
himself even more than the Pitt of-
fense. Tinsley has gone from just
another defensive back to one of the
stars on Pitt's suddenly high-powered
offense. He has caught the notice of
more than a few NFL scouts who
have been impressed with his hands
and his ability to make extremely
sharp cuts.

And on Saturday Tinsley cut a hole
in the Navy defense big enough to
sink the USS Nimitz.

Despite gaining only 12 yards on five
carries, Gladman caught a pass from
Congemi right at the line of scrim-
mage and split the defense, scoring
Pitt's final offensive touchdown of the
day from 39 yards out.

0 Lost in the shuffle of Pitt's big win
is the fact that Navy was able to move

. the football on the Panthers. The Mid-

shipmen amassed 338 yards total of-
fense, and were it not for Pitt's three
defensive touchdowns, the game
wouldn't have been such a blowout.

In fact, Navy drove 80 yards in 10
plays in the first quarter, tying the
game on Smith's 13-yard run. Mid-
way through the drive, Gottfried
called a timeout because the defense
wasn't playing well. And what did he
say? Nothing, but defensive coor-
dinator John Fox did. ”Coach Fox
told us"to calm down and not worry
about it,” said Owens. ”He said just
to think about what we're doing, and
everything would work out."

0 The Panthers travel to the Carrier
Dome in Syracuse, New York to take
on the Orangemen this weekend. Pitt
hasn't defeated Syracuse since 1983
when Pat Viancourt kicked the game-
winning field goal on the game's final
play. The Orangemen are currently

2-5. They defeated Temple 27-24 on ’

Saturday.

Where have
all the bowl
reps gone?

Pitt is now 4-2-1 and in good
position to stake a claim as a bowl
team this season. Scouts from
both the Citrus and Hall of Fame
Bowls were at the Pitt-Notre
Dame game two weeks ago and
‘ were supposed to be at Saturday's
game, but no bowl scouts actual-
ly showed.

Nevertheless, Pitt has a better

I than even chance at post-season

play this year, and that fact has not
been lost on some Pitt players.

”You always think about bowl
games,” said John Congemi, ”but
always in the back of your mind.”

Offensive lineman Randy Dix-
on agreed. ”|t's there,” he said.
”We think about it. Coach Gott-
fried mentioned at practice a few
times last week that this is an im-
portant game if we are going to go
to a bowl game.”

”Coach Gottfried told us we
need at least three more wins to
have the option of getting in a
bowl game,” Tony Woods said.
”We can't look past anybody.”

If Pitt does play in a bowl game
this year, it will mark the first time
since the January 1, 1984 Fiesta
Bowl that Pitt will have made a
bowl appearance.-

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 27, I986

Freshman Jim Bottomley has been a pleasant suprise for the

Pitt soccer team this season.

By Teresa Varley

For The Pitt News

When the University of Pittsburgh
soccer season began, Jim Bottomley
was hoping he would get to play in
some of the Panthers’ games. Like
any freshman, he knew at times he
would have to take the back seat to
the older, more experienced team
members.

But Bottomley certainly did not sit
for long. After seeing limited playing
time in a few games early on, Bot-
tomley got his big chance at the Mar-
shall Tournament and responded just
like any experienced upperclassman
would.

.In the first game of the tournament,
Bottomley scored two goals to help
lead the Panthers to a 5-0 victory over
Moorehead State. The Fox Chapel
High School graduate went even one
step further. In the important final
game of the championship against
Vanderbilt, he was one of the starting
strikers for the Panthers.

In fact, when his name was an-
nounced as an All-Tournament selec-
tion, it came as no surprise to same.
But, from the look on Bottomley's
face, you could tell he felt differently.

”I was really surprised,” Bottomley
said quietly. ”I wasn't expecting it.

Pitt ties

St. John's
in soccer

The Pitt soccer team recorded
its second tie of the season in
Saturday's game against the St.
John's Redmen in New York.

The Panthers, 8-4-2 on the
season, are now 0-2-1 in Big East
conference play. Last season Pitt
defeated St. John's 1-0 at Pitt
Stadium.

Mike Grimes, a senior forward
and tri-captainfor the Panthers,
scored the first goal of the game
when the ball bounced off a
Redmen defender.

St. John's, with under 10
minutes to go in the game, scored
two quick goals to put them ahead
2-1.

Panther sophomore Jeff Vargas
tied the game with minutes left,
sending it into overtime.

Neither team was able to score .
in the overtime period. '

The Panthers’ next game is
tomorrow against Carnegie
~ Mellon at Tech Field.

When: Wednesday, Oct0ber29th 8:00 pm
Where: Public Health Auditorium  

I was really happy that I got the play-
ing time. I was excited to score my
first goal. I was wondering if it would
ever come. It was an opportunity to
spark the team, and I felt good about
it."

Helping the team is something that
is important to Bottomley. He is a
team player and wants to contribute
in any way he can.

”Jim is a hard-nosed, aggressive
player,” Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher
said. ”He’s not flashy, but he gets
things done. When we've called
upon him he has done a great job.
He works hard for the team. He has
the drive and natural ability to be a
winner.”

And Bottomley has been a winner
for some time. He's been playing soc-
cer for a while and has been associ-
ated with many winning programs.
He came to Pittsburgh from Pebble
Beach, Ca., where soccer was more
popular. He went to Fox Chapel for
two years, and those were probably
his best two years of soccer. Under
coaches Jim Perry and Ed Boyle, Bot-
tomley developed into a solid player.

”My coaches moved me from mid-
field to striker,” Bottomley said.
”Striker is a much better position for
me. They taught me how to play a
position I really didn't know anything
about. It was the best thing for me.”

WE "ii

to come  

Bottomley responded to the move
by scoring 15 goals his junior year
and 24 his senior season at Fox

Chapel. He was named All-WPIAL 
and played for the North team in the ' ‘

Dapper Dan Soccer Classic.
When Bottomley decided to come
to Pitt, he looked at two things. First,

he was impressed with the Panthers’ V.

third-year coach, Joe Luxbacher, who

has done wonders with the program." i_‘

The second appealing point was that
Pitt was close to his home. ‘
”lt’s nice that my family doesn't

have to travel far to come to -the »

games," Bottomley said. ”I live close
enough that I can easily go home on
the weekends. It's nice to be able to
live on campus and also be close to
home.” 

Bottomley has also discovered that
he likes the people of Pittsburgh.

”The people here, especially the
ones that I have met at Pitt, are real-
ly nice,” Bottomley . commented."
”I’ve made a lot of good friends. We
have a good team attitude. Everybody
gets along real well. There are_no
conflicts."

The Pitt soccer team is just that —.
a team. They have posted an 8-4-2
record to date, and it has been in-
dividuals like Jim Bottomley who
work toward the team goal that have
made them so successful.

What a boring game

 The referees could have called this one at halftime

 

   

Whoever said winning was fun? In
most instances it is, yet not all the
time and not for everyone involved.

At Saturday's homecoming game
against Navy, the Panthers crushed
the Midshipmen 56-I4. I'm sure the
win was a big boost for everyone
associated with the Pitt football
program.

Coaches and players alike saw their
hard work and dedication in practice
pay off, while fans and alumni got to
see the Panthers play as a good, solid
major college football team should
play.

Even I, who is supposed to be an
objective reporter, enjoyed watching
Pitt beat up on Navy. But the fun
didn't last too long. A

Boredom set in at halftime when
Pitt was leading 21-7, and the game

was for the most part over, although
Panther coach Mike Gottfried and
others would disagree with that
theory.

And if not at halftime, then it was
in the early part of the third quarter
when Pitt scored on a John Congemi
pass of 17 yards to Keith Tinsley to
make the score 28-7. That score put
the nail in Navy's coffin for sure.

At this point, the stadium crowd
slowly started to disperse. Everyone
went back to their tailgate parties
knowing thatPitt had taken care of
business. The win was in the bag.

But what about me? I had to sit
there in the press box and watch the
entire game. I couldn't leave because
after the game was over, I had to- go
down to the locker room and talk to
Gottfried and some of the players for

right on the money. He had guys
open, but give him credit because he
got the ball to them.”

Gottfried had similar praise for his
field general. ‘(What can you say?

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 27, I986

When Pitt went up 49-7, there
were still five minutes left in the third
quarter. The stands were relatively
empty. With the game well in hand,
Gottfried emptied the bench. No of-
fense to those players who were put
in late in the game, but hardly
anyone was in the stands watching
you guys.

But of course I was. I had to. I men-
tioned to the reporter sitting next to
me that I almost wanted to go down
on the field and interview Gottfried
and some of the players right there
during that dreadful fourth quarter.

The idea sounds absurd, and it is.
I could never do that, yet the
boredom was really getting to me.

I tried to think of ways around it,

but there were none. Ijcould have V

what he does out there or how many
yards he passes for.” .

A fumble recovery by Jerry Wall in
the end zone capped the scoring, as
Pitt sealed its fourth win of the

to eat, but I wasn’t thirsty or hungry.

So instead I just sat around joking
with the reporters seated next to me.
I got tired of that after awhile and
came dangerously close to falling
asleep.

Finally, the game ended.

Many people think sportswriters
have it easy, but don't believe it. It
was nice to see the Panthers win, but
at the same time the large margin of
victory was a turnoff to this reporter.

I wish the Panthersluck in the rest
of their games this year. I hope they
win ‘em all, but please keep those
scores close. It's not any fun sitting
in the press box watching third-string
tailbacks and fifth-string linemen mop
up for the starters in a lopsided foot-
ball game.

In fact, it's down right torturous.

 

season. ”It’s always been tough play-

gemi. ”It feels good to finally get a
big win against them.” From here on
in, John, they only get bigger.

 Volleyball team places third at Tennessee Classic

\\‘_
I .

/"*1

By Kelley Butt

— Sta ff Writer

A little good can always be found
amidst the bad. Although Pitt's
women's volleyball team finished
third in the Tennessee Classic this
weekend, they found more than a lit-
tle good to talk about.

Now 22-8 overall, the Lady Pan-
thers finished two points away from
second place.

In the opening round of the tour-
nament, Pitt claimed a big win over
the host Tennessee Volunteers.
Following three losses in three years
to Tennessee, Pitt was able to break

   

the string in a tiring five game match
(16-14, 6-15, 12-15, 15-4 and 17-15).
Although not nationally ranked, the
Volunteers have the caliber needed
to be a ranked team. Tennessee had
several chances to win during the
final game. However, the Lady Pan-
thers were able to hang on.

”Without question,” stated Coach
Shelton Collier, ”this was our biggest
win of the season. It was very reward-
ing to pull off the 17-15 win, but
beating Tennessee at Tennessee
made the win even more important.”

Lady Panther captain Sue Hoover
said before the match that ”we have
the ability to beat Tennessee.” This

Talk about it...,

win was just one more step in Pitt's
plan to win another Big East title and
a respectable NCAA bid.

Following the Tennessee match,
Pitt took on nationally ranked Pur-
due. One of the most consistent
teams in the nation, Purdue defeated
Pitt in three quick games (15-8,
15-13, 15-4). Pitt could not get back
into their game. The Boilermakers
taught the Lady Panthers a valuable
lesson on the importance of con-
sistency. Coach Collier commented,
”We’re trying to develop some of that
consistency.” Pitt cannot expect to
continue to win if they do not main-
tain or improve their present level of
playing ability.
