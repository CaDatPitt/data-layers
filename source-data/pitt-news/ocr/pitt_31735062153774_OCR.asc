himself was stopped and examined. At
iirst he‘ denied his being’ .a f-res‘h_ie, but.
soon admitted his guilt. He w'as.f-ound
wearing white ..s.0cks‘. and a gray hat.
Judgment was sr_o‘on,pa's'sed upon the
c-ulprit. The executioner ‘advanced
with t-he fshearsi and “amputated the
legs” of the socks. His hat was- then
seized, but no hzaircu-t was adminis-
tered for ‘fear the victim .-might con-

. tract brain -fever in _the rain.
Similar -punis.h=1_‘nent was meted out_'

would not or c.ou-ld not explain.

The -p~ei’for«m_ance\was oyer by one-
