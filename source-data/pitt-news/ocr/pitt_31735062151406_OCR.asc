You simply can’t keep the Pitt men
down, whether they are in the stu-
dcnt’s rank or whether they have ad-
vanced a step and ‘entered Uncle
Sam’s ranks. Sometime ago E. C,
Kirker, president of the sl-tudent sen-
ate and “Vic”-Jevon, editor of the
“Owl” and Pitt’s star cartoonist,
oined the aviation ‘forces and were
sent to Columbus, O_., for training. We

by the daily grind without the shouts
of. the crowd that makes the big
track men. By the way the men are
tackling their work——that determin-
ism to do their best for old Pitt,-—
should indicate the best season yet
for the Pittites. They have excellent
material out for both teams, some of
them the best men ever at Pitt in
their special events. ,

The boys are scheduled for some
hard work, before the novelty of
‘being outdoors wears off. The Penn.
relays may’ seem far off but four
weeks soon pass and only the men
who are ﬁt and show something will
make the trip. ’

The date «for the Tech meet has
not been deﬁnitely settled as the.
Plaid wanted to secure some other
team for the date held open for them.
It is probable that thetwo Oakland
institutions will clash in a midwweek
meet either Mayl or May 8. Other-
wise all other dates have been ﬁlled
by Manager-Byers sand the schedule
he has arranged is "without doubt the
classiest that Pitt‘has ever had. The
Panthers will meet. thewbest of the
big colleges in the east during the
Pennlrelays, April 25,‘ and the I. C.
A. A. A. A. meet, May 31 and June‘
1. Both of these meets are held at
Franklin Field, at Philadelphia.

The other events are the duel with
the Navy -on the 12th of May, at
Annapolis, and the Pitt Intercolleg-
iate.. The clash with the Midship-
men is the ﬁrst with that institution
on the cinders. They have been met
in practically every other branch of

athletics, football, ‘baseball, wrestling, 

.-and. ~swirnniing,~ with more «or less

the first part of the season; ehoyvever,
they showed great pluckwhen they
closed their season by beating‘ the
Sigma K-appas in a well-fought game?

TENNIS PLAYERS
ASKED TO REPORT

All men interested in tennis are
urged to hand their names to Mr.
Miller at t-he gym. at once. It is
hoped to secure a,good list of can-
didates for the next game, and if
there is suﬂicient interest and some
good material shows up a schedule
will be arranged for the men. Al-
readyﬂinquiries and requests for dates
have reached the Athletic Depart-
ment and -thereseems to be little
trouble ahead in getting the teams to
complete a good schedule.

The manager selected }for this year,
A. K. Anderson, of the Pitt Weekly
sporting staff, has been called into
the Service and no work has been
done on the schedule yet. It just
depends -on the interest shown by
the followers of the lawn sport,

 

"whether work will go‘ ahead on the

schedule. Pitt has always had a fair‘
team on the court and provision has‘
been made. by the Athletic Council
for ﬁnancing a team again this year.

Practically al of last year’s men on
-both the aVrsity and Freshmen
teams have entered the service for
dropped out of school. This will give
new men all kinds of opportunity of
winning a “P.” Freshmen as well as
upper classmen are urged to get in
the game, as ‘many of’ the ‘high
schools around the city are anxious
to meet the ﬁrst "year Amen on the
