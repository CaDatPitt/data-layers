Students Query Administrators

Open Dialogues Initiated

by JUDY VOLLMER

About 80 students met with
University administrators in an
open question session called Both
Sides Now on Monday afternoon
in David Lawrence Hall. Organ-
ized by Associated Women Stu-
dents (AWS), the session was the
first in a series of open meetings
designed to bring students and ad-
ministrators together to discuss
issues that raise questions at the
University. ‘

The first question concerned
Central Printing's planned move
into the University Theatres of-
fice in the basement of the Cathe-
dral.

The theater major who ques-
tioned this move declared, “The
theatre keeps being slighted and
put aside everytime there is a
need for financial expansion. The
University, which professes to be
a liberal arts institution, is actual-
ly cutting down on the arts.”

Jerome Schneewind, dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences. re-
sponded bypexplaining that, on the
contrary, the University has not
cut down on the arts programs.
He stated that the Central Print-
ling move was due to a breakdown
in communications mainly be-
cause of a turnover of the theatre
staff.

“Our music programs are much
greater this year. especially with
the growing concert series. And
in terms of space for the theatre,
it's just terrible everywhere."

ROOM AND BOARD

Another student asked about the
rise in living cost at the Universi-
ty. He asked. “Why the room and
board raise? Is it true that John
Vrana received a $4,000 raise this
term?"

Vrana. director of Housing, and
Bernard Kobosky. assistant chan-
cellor of Student Affairs. both an-
swered that Vrana had not receiv-
ed a $4,000 raise.

Concerning the housing fee in-
ll.-rease, Vrana stated, “A great
portion of the raise supplied 15-30
per cent raises for food service
employees. All of our income has
matched our total expenditures.

we've been coming closer to com-
plete balance.”

The Commuter Association pro-

. posed the construction of bus shel-

ters for commuters last winter.

and a student asked why they have
not yet been built.

Dan McFadden, director of Stu-
dent Affairs and Planning, ex-
plained the hold-up was due to de-
lay in city planning. “The money
has been allocated. and the entire
program will be underway within
a couple of weeks. We had to go
through city planning committees,
the Zoning Board and Public
Works."

UNIVERSITY EXPANSION

Replying to a question focusing
on hillside and Forbes Ave. expan-
sion Posvar remarked, “We have
tried to establish complete candor
in communications in our plans
for University expansion. Unfor-
tunately. there has been a degree
of hostility, anxiety, and misun-
derstanding. We have clearly de-
limited our boundaries. In the
southwest, Oakland Ave. is the
boundary. This will ease a burden
of hundreds of people moving out
of their communities."

Posvar continued. “The hillside
dormitory complex is entirely
within the zoning limitations. We
have oriented the whole complex
downhill, and have centralized
pedestrian traffic to one escala-
tor that runs through the build-
ings. The most amazing piece of

propaganda that has been circu-
lated about this hillside complex
is that the University is planning
to take Falk School‘s playground
away. This type of misunder-
standing is. however. understand-
able.“

Edison Montgomery, vice chan-
cellor of Finance. continued that
the property has all been legally
acquired through the General
State Authority, and that the Uni-
versity will delay demolition on
Forbes Ave. as long as possible in
order to help out Oakland busi-
nesses. The University will move
first on the Forbes Field area.

Montgomery added, “We are
also aware that many students
are being exploited by Oakland
landlords. We are working toward
a solution where the supply for

housing begins to get closer to de-

mands.”

Near the end of the hour-long
session. a young woman asked
about the findings of the Health.
Education, and Welfare investiga-
tions here at the University.

Posvar responded, “We are

working on proposals and pro-
grams to re-orient attitudes of ad-
and stu-

ministration, faculty,
dents concerning racism, sexism,
and bigotry, and are working to
eliminate these practices. The
programs will propose to employ-

more blacks, women, and to equal-

Women’s “Owl” Complaint
Mired In Campus Grapevine

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

A small delegation of Universi-
ty women. including students and
faculty. approached Dean of Stu-
dent Development Charles Mont-
gomery last Monday. Oct. 19. to
request that the administrator
hear their joint complaints con-
cerning the 1969-70 Owl and
other matters.

Since ‘that session. the purpose'
and conclusions of that visitation
have been highly misunderstood
and in cases condemned by the
human relay stations of the Uni-
versity grapevine system.

It is essential that the air be
cleared concerning the position of
the women involved in the contro-
versy:

The traditional treatment of the
woman by the media in general
emerged as the main issue in the
discussions. Females have almost
exclusively been portrayed by
popular periodicals as mindless
bodies.

MISPLACED EMPHASIS

Emphasis has nearly always
dealt with female proportions and
sexual attractiveness. Several of
the most successful national mag-
azines have capitalized on the
stereotype to fill their coffers at
the expense of female sensibil-
ities.

The prime motion of the wom-
en's liberation movement at this
point involves combatting the
stereotyped images that even
woman have come to accept of
themselves.

It was widely felt at the meet-
ing that the University should
lead the way in promoting social
change and fighting the institu-
tionalized oppression-of minority
groups. 1

The women were convinced that
the Owl had failed in its duties.
Several pages of the yearbook

 

 

were devoted to Editor Bruce
Barr‘s personal impressions of
the women's liberation move-
ment. put together without con-
sultation with either of the two
functioning women‘s interest
groups on campus—the Pittsburgh

Women’s Liberation and the Uni- ’

versity Committee for Women’s
Rights.

In its final form. the yearbook
depicted the movement by a
series of psychedlically-colored
prints of the nude women. Cor-
responding to Tommy Lee pic-
tures were a few brief lines of
copy that posed the "tongue-in-
cheek" question “Who will want
to be liberated next?"

OBJECTION TO TREATMENT

The protesting women objected
to the treatment and requested
that they be given the chance to
expresstheir point of view. With
the exception of a lone voice there
was no talk of censorship of des-
truction of the book or the pages
therein. No one wanted to rip
them off or rip them out.

Rather. the nature of the pub-
lication prompted the women to
request that current Editor How-
ard Berger insert an addition to
the finished copy explaining the
motives of the movement to fem-
inism. its relationship to the cam-
pus and a discussion of popular-
media handling of the female.

Because the yearbook serves as
a permanent record and supposed-
ly provides a gestalt impression
of a year's University events, the
women felt that a crime of omis-
sion was committed in the book‘s
failure to reflect the growing
women‘s movement.

Unfortunately, there is validity
to the countercharge that many
students still preceive women as
objects with the logical conclu-
sion that the yearbook section
adequately represented that
frame of mind.

The question of responsibility.

professional standpoint. Barr as
Editor of the yearbook had assum-

moods. The burden of his task in-

NEGLECT

Berger has the power to make
available to a student readership
another side of the question—a
side that was neglected by an-
other.

The usage of the pictures has
been justified by their author and
others on the basis of their artis-
tic merit. There is no fast and
steady definition of art and in all
probability. the debate will never
be resolved. -

But perhaps, the photographer
and his editor might ask them-
selves some self-examining ques-
tions:

Is the function of art to please
the eye and offer an aesthetic lift.
perhaps at the risk of opressing
and exploiting others‘? Or does art
require a loftier position’?

In a different place and a differ-
ent time. Lee's “photo art“ may
be acceptable and appealing, but
in the context that envelops it. it
is sexist.

When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the

political bands which have connected them wit

entitle them_,a decent respect to the opinion o

causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are en-

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pu

THE BILL OF RIGHTS

   

O 

Lieutenant Governor Ray-
mond Broderick has proposed
that state aid to state-related
universities in Pennsylvania be
reduced.

Broderick, the Republican
candidate for Governor. is dis-
turbed by the financial plight of
private universities like Du-
quesne. He believes tuition rates
‘ , at Pitt. Penn State. Temple and
Indiana State should be hiked. to
make private schools more com-
petitive_ in the higher educa-
tion market.

It is not clear. however.
whether this is Mr. Brodericks
dominant concern. He speaks
;also of saving Pennsylvania tax-
payers between $100 million and
by $150 million.

“MUCH of the state budget
subsidizes tuition for families
who could afford to pay more."
Broderick said here last week.
To his mind, it therefore follows
that such families should pay
more.

The Pitt News repudiates that
.  point ofview,

 

 

 

It is necessary to frankly ad-
mit that factors of self-interest
incline Pitt students to recoil at
Mr. Broderick's proposal.

BUT students at state-related
universities need not resort to
selfish pleas. to convince" Mr.
Broderick that he is wrong. Stu-
dents should approach him not
as lobbyists but as educated men

and women who , appreciate
higher educations value to
Pennsylvania.

Chancellor Posvar‘ noted re-
cently that higher education's
"social benefits" are enormous.
Moreover. be emphasized. "they
accrue not just to the individ-
ual and his family but to so-
ciety."

Professor Richard Wynn of
the School of Education has
stressed that “the cost of educa-
tion must be viewed. not as a
drain on the economy like gar-
bage collection. but rather as a
high yield investment.“

THE correlation between an.

investment in higher education

    

, .,cr.7n. 3 ‘Eli’:

and social benefits is clear. With
such an investment. per capita
income rises. industries are at-
tracted to the state. employ-
ment increases. In addition. bet-
ter parents. better citizens. and
better services result.

Perhaps Mr. Broderick is not
to blame.

If he is catering to the public
when he calls for reduced aid to
state-related universities. it
may indicate that Pitt students.
administrators. and faculty
members have not adequately
conveyed to Pennsylvanians the
importance of higher education
to the state.

A study conducted by Dr.
Heinz Eulau. chairman of the
Political Science Department at
Stanford. found “that the public
does not communicate much
with state politicians concern-
ing higher education. and that
such exchange as occurs tends
to be sporadic and unorganized."

PUBLIC officials. of course.

are accustomed to anticipating
the public‘s reaction to a speci-

 

..., 5.’ .

fic policy proposal. Surely. Mr.
Broderick has enough political
savvy to know that Pennsylvania
taxpayers are not likely to be
displeased by a suggestion that
they pump less money into the
state university system.

But shouldn't Pennsylvania's
next Governor be an educator in
his own right? And must he not.

infairness. :.'.ress to the public.

and to the State Legislature that
the Commonwealth would be
abandoning its commitment to
justice if it forced students and
their families to pay the full cost
of a higher education. despite
the fact that the Commonwealth
itself derives great benefits
from that education?

As economist
has pointed out.
benefits of higher education.
whether economic or noneco-
nomic. are "hard to quantify”
and "difficult to measure.” He
stresses. however. that “the ex-
ternal benefits are public bene-
fits. and governments must de-

cide." .

  

  r Pennsylvania is’ Next Gal/arnar /14 ast Is? A n Educator

PERHAPS Mr. Broderick
would change his mind, if he
were shown an analysis of high--
er education's social benefits.
Perhaps members of the State
Legislature would provide addi-
tional funds to Pitt and other
state~related universities. if
they could explain to_ their con-
stituents that the cost of schools
is not ‘'like the cost of garbage
collection."

The Pitt News urges students.

administrators. and faculty
members to consider immediate
attempts to extend education
beyond the University.

The public will accept Mr.
Broderick's logic. unless its
flaws are explained-. And Mr.
Broderick will continue to ar-
gue that aid to state—related uni-
versities should be reduced. un-
less he is brought to realize
that the solution to the plight of
the private universiy in Penn-
sylvania is more aid. not less.

 New Racism»

From Unique Angle

Editor. The Pitt News:
This is in response to Richard

McDonough‘s letter that attacked.

mine of a few weeks ago. It cer-
tainly is quite obvious now that
McDonough has a myopic eye for
political and economic truths in
addition to reading what he wants
to read rather than what is there.
This was the case with Jack Si-
mon‘s letter and Philip Manfreds
letter as well as my own.

McDonough is confused about
my statement of socialism re-en-
slaving black people and he cant
figure out why Marxist blacks
would want to sell their people
into slavery. If you remember. I
said that "Any black man that
supports slavery is contributing
to his own death." If you know

anything about slave revolts. you,

will know that it was the slaves
that told the masters of the im-
pending reyolts thus showing a
satisfaction with slavery. This is
by no means calling the Marxist
blacks Uncle Toms or house

are dupes of the philosophy.

Secondly. McDonough. I have
had many conversations with pro-
claimed socialists and this is
what they appear to be advocating

a state slavery rather than a
plantation one.

One reason why I coined the
words "New Racism" is because
the New Left uses the word New
on several occasions. such as the
New Left. the New Working Class.
So why not New Racism since it
comes from a new. unique and
an insidious angle‘? There are
many different kinds of capital-
ism. conservatism. and liberal-
ism as well as racism. Certainly.
you couldn‘t put the racism of the
Ku Klux Klan in the same class
of Senator J. William Fulbright.

There is one thing. however.
that I do agree with McDonough-
his doubt that anyone will debate
me. If you notice in last Wednes-

day's Pitt News, the RSU chal-
lenged the YAF on campus to a
debate but not me although the de-
bate that they proposed was im-
possible since conservatism is
not an economic system.

As the late Whitaker Chambers

economic system; it only has eco-

McDonough is so omniscient
about —— I say to him that if the

MEREDITH STOPS PUBLICATION

or NEW COLLEGE MAGAZINE

THE MAGAZINE, a Meredith Corporation magazine for college students,
which had scheduled its first issue for October will not be published.

Robert A. Burnett, Meredith vice-president andgeneral manager of
the Magazine Division, said lack of advertising support forced the decision
to stop publication two weeks prior to the scheduled mailing of the Octo-

_ Meredith had published two prototypes of The Magazine in Novem-
ber, 1969, and March, 1970, for distribution to advertisers and agencies. The
first issue, carrying eight pages of advertising, was to be sent to one million
students on campuses across the nation. The Magazine was to be circulated
on a controlled basis and published seven times during the school year.

Burnett said, ”This deicision does not change our belief in the need for
an effective publication to reach college students. We were convinced of
this when the decision to publish was made a year ago after a year of re-
search and planning. We were confident we had the product to serve stu-
dents and the means to reach them.

”However, the general slowdown in economic activity today which has
caused reductions in advertising budgets made continuing of The Maga-
zine an unacceptable risk.”

tion of life. protection of the-

"helpless fetus." etc.: in general

they oppose abortion. perhaps

even condemns it. We also feel-

that abortion is. in essence. mur-
der. Abortion destroys life: more
than this the person who under-
goes abortion not only destroys a
life. but part of herself and of her
partner as well.

Even so. we feel that some
form of legal abortion is needed.
To explain this seeming paradox.
one must realize that the senti-

ments expressed above are our-

personal opinions. and while a
great many others may share our
opinions. there are also a great
many others who do not. And we
have no right to restrict others in
such a highly personal matter. No
one has the right to run another‘s
life. especially in a matter so con-
troversial and so contingent on
individual opinion.

One must face facts. Abortion
exists. whether legal or illegal.

  

And if a woman wants an abortion

performed. she'll have it. whether
legal or illegal. How many wom-
en die or are seriously injured
each year at the hands of “butch-
er" abortionists‘? Many of these‘
womennot only succeed in de-
stroying one life. but in destroy-
ing two lives instead. Surely if
destroying a fetus is a tragedy,
then this is an even greater one.
The only way to put an end to the
dangers of illegal abortion is to
legalize it.

Again. we personally agree with
the writers of the previously pub-
lished letters. but we also real-
ize that we cannot extend our be-
liefs to the point that they become
an imposition upon the beliefs of
others. As William Faulkner so
aptly put it: “every man is the
arbiter of his own virtues but let
no man prescribe for another
mans well being"—The Sound and
the Fury.

F V , . 0 , - A o o
Israel Hit As Imperialist
by STEVE LUBETSKY
Joe Stark. an expert in Middle East politics. appeared at C—MU
Monday night to assess the current status of the Palestine Liberation

Movement (PLF). The speaker conducted an informal discussion with
a light turn-out of only 25.

During the summer. Stark toured several Arab states as a mem— _

ber of the Committee of Return Volunteers lCRVl. a Leftist organiza-
tion which focuses on Middle Easter activities. The group visited ref-
ugee camps in Lebanon. Syria. and Jordan and participated in various
health clinics.

Stark pointed out that the PLF has become a most influential force
in Middle East affairs. Citing a camp near Beirut. Lebanon. as an ex-
ample. he said that recently. “the refugees drove out Lebanese author-
ities. who ruled the area for 21 years. The Middle East War of 1967

’ proved most effective in mobilizing the peasants.

“By summer of 1969,” he continued, “the Arab commandos had
complete control.” At that time, “any little spark could have set things
off.”

The spark. he evaluated. came when a policeman's bullet killed a
student during a demonstration: the peasants then mobilized and drove
authorities out. ‘

A atruggle for power immediately proceeded. Stark mentioned that
“different commando groups were represented in each camp and com-
pleted for followers.”

In an effort to gain supporters, these groups have implemented
services such as educational programs and health clinics. As these fa-
cilities expand, Stark suggested, “the people come increasingly clos-
er to independence and self-determination, which is their ultimate

oal.” ~
g He added that their quest for independence is expressed in their
fight against Israel.“ ‘

Following was a question—and-answer session. at which most of
the 25 present seemed hostile to Starks politics. Several Israelis chal-
lenged him on grounds that "Jews also have rights to national aspir-
ations."

Stark, while admitting that “jews have such rights,” maintained
that “they cannot oppress other peoples in the process.”

He granted that “Jews have been oppressed.“ but he wondered if
"people who are oppressed have the right to settle on soil that does not
belong to them."

Someone replied that “Israel belonged t.o the Jews originally. and _

the last time that it was an independent state. Jews had possessionpf
it."

Stark rejected the argumenttas “irrelevant" and condemned Israel
as "an agent of Western imperialism.“

Individual Freedom Ensured

    I Universit

‘ by WESLEY W. POSVAR
Chancellor

The role of a university as a
forum for the discussion of ideas
is heightened. not diminished.
in the midst of a political cam-
paign. , V -

Every university member --
faculty. student. or staff — has
the'right to support the candi-
date and partyof his choice.
however unorthodox or contro-
versial thatchoice may seem to
others. both within and outside
the university. Membership in
a university hardly entails limi-
tation of the ‘rights of citizen-
ship. On the contrary. one may
hope that it would lead to a full-
er and more discerning exercise
of those rights. The special
training of scholars. the oppor-
tunity for reflection. the sharp-

ening of issues by debate on the ‘

campus should enhance the in-
telligent use of the ballot.
However.. what is permissible
and laudable for an
may be quite. the reverse for an
academic institution. In effect.
a university that engages in
political activity does so at the
expense of its own inherent
mission. a fundamental aspect
of which must be a continuing

”“‘hospitality to divergent opinions.

The first casualty of a politi-
cized university is the freedom
of its individual members. If a
university becomes "a partisan
‘advocate in electoral affairs in-
stead of a forum for. ideas. its
atmosphere of free thought and
; free speech is jeopardized.

There is another factor
lated to a university’s involve-
ment in politics which must be
considered. namely the insti-
tution’s obligations under
law. «Some of its funds come
directly from a public treasury
and some are donated priva-tely
under circumstances providing

tax relief to the donor. ‘ More-

‘over, the use of public funds

to support the candidacy of
particular individuals would
be inconsistent with true de-
mocracy, and this is so whether

the funds happen- to be spent

by a university or by some
governmental bureau.

For these reasons. a univer-
sity"s status as a nonprofit
institution depends. in part.
upon its abstention from po-

litical activity. Under the ap-
plicable statute- the \ participa-
tion in or intervention by such
an institution in any political
campaign on behalf of any can-
didate for public office is
proscribed. The reach. and also

the -limitations. of this prohibi-‘I

tion have recently been examin-
ed in a set of guidelines develop-
ed by the American Council on
Education (ACE) in consulta-
tion with the Internal Revenue
Service.

It is therefore the policy of
the University of Pittsburgh. not
to participate in. or intervene

Wliat is the relevance of stu-

student involvement in the cam-

Arnold could not say how stu-

affect Pitt’s allocation from the

However. he did state that
“the states present financial

Having busily collected
information on candidates in
the upcoming election. Mrs.
Jane Thompson. Director of
the Citizenship. Information
Center (CIC). is eagerly
waiting for students to dis-
playtheir interest.

In Progress

The .ClC has set up an infor-
mation booth in the Student Union
for those students wishing to ’par-
ticipate in an election campaign.
Formerly. the booth was in the
Cathedral at the ground floor in-
formation desk. The information
centeris also supplying data on
the various candidates.

In its few weeks of operation
in 1209 CL. the CIC has set up.
files on several types of national
political organizations. and~'—ha_,s

instruction: may adopt resolu-
tions endorsing or opposing: a
candidate or taking a position
on an issue involved in a cam-
paign for the purpose of assist-
ing or opposing a candidate.
Such resolutions should clearly
indicate that they do not stat

a University position. .

4. University funds. facilities.‘
or services may not be used for
any participation or. interven-
tion in a political campaign on

behalf of any candidate for
public office. This prohibition
includes. among other things.

the publishing or distributing of
statements and the use of_Uni-
versity printing and ‘copying
equipment for the reproduc-
tion of materials to be used in a

_ political campaign.

5. These principles are not
intended to inhibit or restrict the
reporting of student involvement
in politics or the expression of
editorial views. identified as
such. in nonpartisan media such
as student publications and broad-
casts.

cess could have a positive impact
on government in Arnold’s opin-
ion. “A natural outgrowth of
student involvement could be a
generation of young people who
will hold politicians a little
moreVaccountable," he comment.-
ed. '

But a_re two days of campaign-
ing enoughi’ Arnold feels that
“stud-ents should try to affect
government through proper chan-
nels and sustain their involve-
ment." ’ ' '

One of his suggestions for con-
tinuing student involvement ‘is
the establishment of a student
governmental relations com-
mittee. This committee would
contact Harrisburg on a regular
basis and provide_an ‘exchange
of information between stu-
dents and legislators.

Arnold maintains that “legis-
lators are not untouchable,” and
he added that “Legislators may

cation‘ if they can feel" the pulse

v hand,

President Nixon will have
made forays into 21 states by -
Election Day. in a daring
attempt to gain control of the
Senate for the Republican
Party.

It is unlikely that the Presi-
dents fondest hopes will mater-

‘ialize. Non does O’Brien‘s pessi-

mism, if genuine, seem war-
ranted. But the Democrats, who
currently hold 57 of the Senate's
100 seats, could easily suffer a
net loss of at least a couple seats.

One reason is that only 10
Republican Senators are up for
re-election this year. in contrast
to 25 Democratic Senators.

Four Republicans Stalked

Of the 10 Republicans. only
four are in serious trouble - Sen-
ator Ralph Smith of Illinois. Sen-
ator Charles Charles Goodell of
New York. Senator George Mur-
phy of California, and Senator
Winston Prouty of Vermont.

The Democrats, on the other
could possibly lose as
many as a dozen seats. Demo-

I  cratic candidates in Tennessee,

Indiana, Texas, Connecticut, and
Ohio are particularly vulnerable.

Republicans Goodell and Smith
seem doomed. Goodell, who was
appointed by Governor Rocke-
feller to fill the vacant seat left
‘by Robert Kennedy in 1968. for-
feited’ most of his conservative
support when he joined the ranks
ol' Senate doves, in a stunning
about-face.

He is being challenged by4Con-
gressman Richard Ottinger. the
amply financed Democratic nom-
inee. and by Conservative James
Buckley. brother of

celebrity-

  
  
  
 
  
  
 
 

     
 

   
 

 

Senator Joseph Tydings

columnist William. who is doing
so well in the polls that liberal
Republicans will- be strongly
tempted to cast their votes for
Ottinger. since Goodell appears
too l'ar behind to stop Buckley.
~Smith. named to finish Ever-
ett Dirksens unexpired term. is
no match for Illinois Treas-
urer Adlai Stevenson III. He
tried to link Stevenson to stu-
dent demonstrators at the 1968
Democratic National Convention
but_indulged in exaggerated
charges which seem to be back-
firing. ‘
The Reagan Lustre

Murphy. whose advanced years
and impaired voice threaten to
bring his political career to an
end. nevertheless stands to bene-
fit from California‘ Governor
Ronald Reagan's popularity.
Reagan. who is expected to
slaughter "Big Daddy“ Jesse
Unruh. may bring along Murphy
on his coattails.

36 year old Congressman
John Tunney is waging a strong
fight against Murphy. ‘Moreover,
California voters are notorious
ticket-splitters. But Tunney’s at-
tendance record has been em-
barassing (the fourth worst in
the House), and he is regarded
by some as more ambitious than

talented, despite his liberalism.

Prouty may be defeated by.
former Governor Philip Hoff -
a Democrat of considerable ap-
peal. Vermont is a staunch Re-
publican state. and Proutys ex-
perience is in his favor. But in
contrast to the dynamic Hoff.

Prouty is personally bland and

devoid of charisma. In an age
when images count as much
as issues. that could spell his
demise.

To Snare the Fox

A prime target of the Nixon
administration. Senator Albert
Gore of Tennessee is hoping that
his populist record and folks_y
manner will enable him to stave
off defeat at the hands of Repub-
lican Congressman William
Brock. heir to a candy fortune.

But Gore. who has been una-
bashedlyliberal despite the fact
that he comes from a conserva-
tive state. may have gone too far
when he voted against confirming
Clement Haynsworth and G.
Harrold Carswell. two southern

.judges President Nixon tried to

appoint to the Supreme Court‘.

The “gray fox of Carthage,”
whose stock is rising according
to the polls, attempted to trans-
form the Republican administra-
tion’s -personally delivered en-
dorsements of Brock into an asset
by calling Nixon and Agnew
”carpetbaggers.” He has also
stressed that Carswell was round-
ly repudiated by Florida voters
in his recent bid for the Repub-
lican senatorial nomination.

Senator Vance Hartke of In-
diana is in similar straits. For
years. he has voted his cons-
cience at the expense of appeal-
ing to his conservative constitu-
ents. For the election. he has
tried to tone down his liberal
image - by voting for the D.C.
Crime Bill. for example.

But Hartke. like Gore. is
clearly fighting for his political
life. Congressman Richard Roude-
bush. bolstered by the President

and the Vice-President. may
very well retire Hartke. unless
unemployment in Indiana. due

partially to the General Motors
Strike. boosts Democratic sup-
port among blue-collar workers.

Scandal Fallout

In Ohio. Republican Congress-
man Robert Taft Jr. and million-
aire Howard Metzenbaum are
locked in a tight contest for
the seat now held by retiring
Senator Stephen Young. The
magic of the Taft name may
be enough to negate the effect
of Metzenbaums television
blitz.

But the deciding factor
could prove to be a statehouse
scandal which implicated State
Auditor Roger Cloug. Republi-
can candidate for governor.
Should Democratic gubernator-
ial candidate John Gilligan win
by a sizeable margin. Metzenbaum
might squeak past Taft.

In traditionally Democratic
Connecticut, incumbent Senator
Thomas Dodd, the Reverend Jos-
eph Duffey, and Republican
Congressman Lowell Weicker
are engaged in a puzzling fight.

Duffey. the national Chairman
of Americans for Democratic
Action. secured the Democratic
nomination. only to be challeng-
ed by Democrat Dodd. who de
diced to run as an independent
after realizing he couldn‘t get
the Democratic nod. Dodd. who
was censured by the Senate in
1967 for using money raised at
testimonials for private pur-
poses. suffers from a tarnished
reputation. but still has a fol-
lowing in the state.

The question is whether anti-

 

communist Dodd will draw more
votes away from Duffey. who
is currently leading in the polls.
or Weicker. He is the spoiler in
the _race and the nature of his
appeal will largely determine the
outcome.

Texas Purists

In Texas. where the two candi-
dates hold essentially the same
views. the purity‘ of the Demo-
cratic Party is as much at stake
as the Senate seat itself.

-Incumbent Senator Ralph Yar-
borough, who has feuded with
conservative Texas Democrats
for years, finally fell in the May
Democratic primary, as the party
nominated Lloyd Bentsen, ultra-
conservative. Bentsen’s opponent,
Congressman George Bush, is no
less conservative, but as a Repub-
lican, he rankles some liberal
Democrats less than Bentsen.

A group called the Democratic
Rebuilding Committee surfaced
over the summer. adopting as its
motto a quote from President
Kennedy:"Sometimes ‘ party loy-

_ alty asks too much.” The Rebuild-

ing Committee hopes to convince
liberals to vote for Bush. to pre-
vent conservatives from control-
ling both parties in the state.
Lyndon Johnson and John ..Con-
nall_y. however. are doing their
best to curtail defections. with
token help from Yarborough.

\ Walkin’ Lawton

"Walkin‘ Lawton“ Chiles ap-
pears to have captured the im-
agination of Florida voters. al-
though Republican _Congress-
man William Cramer is waging
a credible campaign against him.
Chiles. dressed in_khakis and
boots. conducted a walking tour
of the state and grabbed the
Democratic nomination away
from former Governor Farris
Bryant. the favorite in Florida's
September primary. He should
win the Senate seat vacated by
retiring Senator Spessard Hol-
land. but is not a sure victor.

Democratic candidates are also
vulnerable in Nevada, North
Dakota, Utah, New Jersey,

Maryland, and New Mexico, al-
though they are expected to win.

is the son of the man Tydings
defeated six years ago. Beall is
likely to follow in his fathers
footsteps.

New Mexico Senator Joseph
Montoya will not have an easy
time defeating Republican ,

Anderson Carter.‘ who toppled.

Governor David Cargo in a
spring primary. He does have a
decided edge. however.

Three other races are not in
doubt. but will be closely watch-
ed. Senator Edmunc Muskie of
Maine. the current front-runner
among possible Democratic
nominees for the Presidency in
1972. will be stronger nationally
if he is re—elected by a land-
slide. Senator Edward Kennedy is
hoping to prove that his popu-
larity at the polls hasn‘t waned

and can do so by defeating Re- .

publican Josiah Spaulding by a
substantial margin.

Last but not least, the resil-
ient Hubert Humphrey is anxious
to be returned to the Senate he
loves, with a heartwarming vote
of confidence from Minnesota
electorate. The tears of joy in
his eyes might be worth the hy-
perbole. I

Historical analysis of mid—term elections permits one very de-
finite generalization——the President's party loses seats in the House
of Representatives. 3

’ Average of 38

There have been 17 mid-term elections in this century. The
President's_ party has suffered a net loss of 650 House seats in those
elections——an average of 38 per election. A Republican net loss of
38 House seats in 1970 would result in an overwhelming majority
for the Democrats in the 92nd Congress—285 to 150.

Often averages can be deceptive. obscuring. extreme fluctua-
tions in gains and losses. That does not happen to be the case here
however. since the Presidents party has gained seats only in this
century—indeed. only since the establishment of the modern two-
party system in 1856. That occurred in 1934 when the Democrats

under Roosevelt gained 14 seats.

In 1962, the Republicans gained but two House seats (consider-
ed a victory for President Kennedy at the time). Otherwise the
losses have varied from a low of 12in 1926 to a high of 80 in 1938. ’

These findings contrast sharply with the Presidential party
record in presidential election years. The President's party has
gained House seats in 14 of the 18 presidential elections in this
century for a net gain of 463 seats—an average of 26 per election.

Are there any factors that would lead us to modify our ex-
pectation. based on historical precedent. of Republican losses.
Democratic gains in 1970?

Nixon Can Gamble

In the first place. the Nixon Administration itself is an excep-
tion to historical precedent. -. '

No other President in this century has has to face a House con-
trolled by the other party during his first two years in office. One
has to go back to 1876 and Rutherford B. Hayes to find such a pre-
cedent. And no President since Zachary Taylor in 1848 has had ‘both

‘ houses of Congress under control of the other party in his first two

years.

Thus. President Nixon simply has less to lose than his prede-
cessors and therefore it is a unique position to gamble. Since his
party does not control eigher house now. he can risk personal in-
volvement in the campaign—something most Presidents have avoided.

And what’ is he risking? With his involvement the results will
be interpreted as reflecting on him and his record. But basically
status quo results. or modest gains in the House. combined with
modest gains in the Senate would be exceptional—accomplished only
by Roosevelt and Kennedyin this century. Since this is very likely
the outcome. Nixon may be in the position of receiving credit. for
the inevitable. '

Let‘s examine the situation in 1970. The Democrats hold 243
House seats. the Republicans 187. and there are five vacancies. The
Republicans must gain 31 seats to organize the House in 1971. Even
the most optimistic Republican slide-rule cannot find the votes for
that outcome.

Few Dozen Seats Doubtful

The fact is that three-fourths of the House seats are absolutely
safe for the incumbent party. That leaves about 100 seats with a
possibility of change. Typically 70 percent of these will also be
won by the incumbent party. leaving approximately 30 to 35 seats
that are truly doubtful.

If the last-minute trend (whether affected by the campaign.
local issues. or voter turnout) is Republican. these few doubtful
seats may go predominantly for GOP candidates. If so. the Repub-
lican gain in 1970 may be as high as 8 to 10 seats. Any more than
that would be nothing short of phenomenal. That result would give
them 195 to 197 seats in the next House of Representatives.

If the last-minute trend favors the Democrats, they may gain
as many as 15 to 20 seats. The difference results from the fact that
more of the doubtful seats are presently held by Republicans.

National Republican leaders decidedto emphasize winning the
Senate in'1970 and raided the House Republican Party for candi-
dates (12 House Republicans are running for Senate seats). Most of
these were attractive vote getters in their districts—_some of which
are now in the doubtful category. A gain of 15 for the Democrats
would leave just 172 House Republicans.

As of now. the most likely result would seem to be a slight gain
for House Republicans in the East and South. virtually no change
in the West. and prehaps a slight Democratic gain in the Midwest.

Dramatic Change Unlikely

' The overall result? The 1971 House of Representatives will look
verymuch like the 1970 House of Representatiyes possibly within
range  mine 69 f’   I *9 ' '   8   8

 

Shifts Forecast

This national result holds for Pennsylvania as well. As of now.
the Pennsylvania delegation has 13 Democrats. 13 Republicans. and
one Republican vacancy. The incumbent party is favored to win in
every district.

Some House races deserve special attention on election eve.
Two women in Connecticut (including the Mayor of Hartford,
Ann Uccello) have an excellent chance to win, and two others,
Louise Day Hicks in Massachusetts and Bella Abzug in New York,
are cetrtain to win. Mrs. Hicks will replace John McCormack,
Speaker of the House, in the ninth, district in Boston. If all four win,
that will be nearly a 50 percent increase in female representation.

Black representation is also likely to increase. possibly includ-
ing a member. Andrew Young. from Atlanta. Then a Jesuit priest
is running in Massachusetts? Rev.'Robert Drinan. and appeared
headed for victory until the man he defeated in the primary re-
entered the race as an independent.

Confrontation Not Reflected

If I am right in predicting relatively little change in the House.
one must surely be led to comment on the American election sys-
tem. -

Presumably the House is our most representative national

institution. Yet there we are in a period of concern. conflict. and

«violence. and the party division in the House remains virtually the
same for two elections (only 13 districts switched parties in 1968).

A recent article on the campaign was entitled. “Confrontation
Goes to the Polls." Perhaps so. but I predict that the results will
not resolve much of anything. Confrontation may go to the polls in
the 1970 mid-term elections. but it will play hell finding the choices
it may want to make there.

For in the most diffused election system in the world, we don’t
put the question; we absorb it.

Lindsay and Agnew
Endorse Opposition

ing defeat in the Republican Primary must be

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Two prominent politicians transcended party
loyalt_ies recently by committing themselves to
candidates of a different party.

New York Mayor~John Lindsay a Republican
who was elected last year as the Liberal Party
candidate endorsed Democrat Arthur Goldberg.
who is opposing Governor Nelson Rockefeller.

Deserting the Party

On the other side. Vice-President Spiro T.
Agnew pledged his support for New York Sena-
torial candidate James Buckley.» campaigning on
the Conservative platform. thus deserting a fellow
Republican. incumbent Senator Charles Goodell.
who has been a persistent critic of the Vietnam
War. -

The motives behind the Agnew endorsement
are obvious. The Vice-President has been work-
ing to excommunicate Goodell from the Republi-
can party. When he was in Pittsburgh earlier
this month, Agnew branded Goodell a “radical-

. liberal” and publicly criticized him for his dis-
loyalty towards the Nixon Administration and hiw
own party.

According to Frank Donatelli. Western Penn- I
sylvania Chairman of the Young Americans for
Freedom. Agnew's endorsement is “an attempt to
divide the liberal vote.“ He noted the findings of
a recent poll which showed that the Democratic
Liberal Richard Ottinger is carrying 36 percent
of the vote. Buckley with 32 percent. and Good-
ell with 15 percent. (A New York Daily News
poll Sunday showed Buckley seven percentage
points ahead of Ottinger.l If a substantial amount
of Ottinger‘s supporters switch to Goddell to
spite Agnew. it could mean a breakthrough for
Buckley.

Reasons for Llndsays actions. however. ap-
pear very ambiguous and subject to speculation.

Political Future

political survival rests with the Democratic Party.
and his move may indicate Presidential or Vice-
Presidential aspirations. ~

Lindsay also had his city to consider. He con-
tends that Rockefellers Administration has*n_ot
granted New York adequate funds for which to
operate. Perhaps Lindsay does feel that Goldberg
will be more reliable in helping him finance New
York City programs. ' .

The Lindsay

ing him to maintain neutrality in the guberna
torial race. Lindsay responded quickly by avowing
support for Goldberg.

Finally. the move may have come as a re
action to the Agnew endorsement of Buckley
Having seen the Vice-President cross party line
and desert someone the Mayor is personally sym

Chances are that Lindsay would have mad

Goldberg ‘agree on so many issues. The Mayo

Liberals whose viewpoints correspond with his. ,

He contends that the Saigon
regime will never be one which
displays democratic responsive-
ness to the will and needs of
the Vietnamese people.

Concerning the rapid growth
of inflation, Senator Sesler al-
leges that the Nixon Adminis-
tration’s economic policy is
proving disastrous.

He maintains that if the Ad-
ministrations approach. a bal-
anced budget. was the approp-

riate one. we would have halted‘

runaway inflation by this time.

Sesler calls for "full employ-
ment. reasonable interestrates.
and soundmoney internationally."
but has failed to designate any
definite program to facilitate
these goals.

According to Sesler. the gov-
ernment must take the initia-
tive in cleaning the environ-
ment. The President could take
the first step immediately by de-
claring a national state of en-
vironmental emergency. and by
mobilizing all the technological
forces at our command to solve
the problem. he asserts.

The Senator considers the Ad-
ministrations refusal to sell ad-
ditional aircraft to Israel a re-

pudiation of long-standing
American policy that jeopar-
dizes Israels existence. He

maintains that Nixon's policy en-
courages Soviet involvement in
the Mideast.

"I call upon the Nixon Ad-
ministration to return to that
policy of friendship and assist-
ance. thereby safeguarding
against the outbreak of
scale hostilities.“

Shapp has contended that the

to doubt that the possession of

On other issues. the former in-
dustrialist favors a thorough
campaign against drug abuse
and dope peddlers accompanied
by more effective programs in

encourages extensive education

Broderick Nixes Tax

by MARY ANN MARKO
Assistant News Editor

“President of Pennsylvania’s
Constitutional Convention, he is
a man who knows’ the law.”
So goes a series of political ra-
dio ads concerning Lt. Gov.
Raymond Broderick, Republican
candidate for governor.

Campaigning Saturday in

Erie for the states GOP candi-
dates was Vice President Spiro
Agnew. who commended Broder-
ick for his tough law and order
stand.

Besides the law and order is-
sue. Broderick has been basing
his campaign on his uncondi-
tional opposition to a state per-
sonal-income tax. He feels that
the state can be adequately fi-
nanced without the “burden of
another broad—based tax“ on
Pennsylvanians.

“State spending can be re-

duced through tighter manage-
ment control. reassessment of
priorities in programming. and
living within the dollars avail-
able." maintains the 56-year-
old native Philadelphian.
“There is little sense behind in-
creasing programs if the funds
are. not available to support
them."

In the area of higher educa-
tion, Broderick has suggested
that tuition ‘at Pitt and other
state-related universities and
state colleges be hiked to bring

by JANE HENDERSON

In contrast to the bitter guber-
natorial» battle, the contest for
Pennsylvania’s United States
Senator has offered little excite-
ment to the state’s voters. Sen-
ate Minority Leader, Hugh
Scott, challenged by Democratic
State Senator William Sesler,
looks like a shoo-in. I

Although some have accused
Scott of playing "puppet" for

the Nixon administration. he is,

generally considered a "moder-
ate." During the past two years
in the Senate. he has shown his
independence on many occasions
by voting against administration
legislation.

On specific issues, Scott has
endorsed the Nixon administra-
tion’s proposal for an all-volun-
teer army.

“We have met the President
only halfway by instituting a
lottery system. Weymust go fur-
ther to meet his request for a
volunteer army."

Scott also has urged the initi-
ation_of a policy which would
phase—out draftees. from Viet-

nam: - His proposal is ;to, sent f

it. closer to that being charged
by private colleges‘ and uni-
versities in the state.

According to Brodericksplan.
progressive reductions would be
made in appropriations to state
colleges and state-related uni-
versities. as tuition would be
gradually raised to make pri-
vate colleges competitive. The
money thus saved would be put
into a massive student-loan pro-
gram.

Broderick feels that campus
disorders can be curbed through
establishment of “viable lines of
communication" between
dents and college administrators.
He suggests a review and revis-
ion of procedures for disciplin-
ary action. ‘

sent law.

Shapp also rigorously supports

that Air-pollution laws have been

tighter state controls.

bodia crisis. Scott played a
major role in "perfecting the
language" of the Cooper—Church
Amendment. Previously condemn-
ing the President for this involve-
ment and placing the withdraw-
al deadline for l.'.S. troops at
July 1. the wording of the
amendment after the revision
merely suggested strongly that
the troops be out of Cambodia
by July 1. In short. Scott suc-
ceeded in watering down the
amendment before it passed the
Senate by a vote of 82-11.

More recently, Scott outlined
the Nixon legislation on campus
terror. The plan read that “fed-
eral authorities would be per-
mitted to intervene immediately
on any campus which receives
federal funds (most colleges
and universities) after an overt
act such as bombing or fire-
bombing.” Scott also endorses a
bill that would make it a feder-
al crime to assault or kill a po-
liceman on duty. ”‘

Concerning environmental
problems. Scott introduced into
the Senate a package of seven
bills“: designed ‘to _implement

.f'a_'c_ili_ties‘_; to .control water ‘:and_'

"Any incidents of alleged dis-
crimination or brutality by law
enforcement officials should be
investigated promptly and swift
action taken if needed.“ he add-
ed.

Turning to the question of
abortion. Broderick opposes
liberalization of abortion laws.
"Although I am a Catholic. to
me this is not a question of re-
ligion." he said. “It is a matter
of life and death. Everyone has
a right to live. and I need no
convincing that life begins prior
to birth."

According to the gubernatorial
candidate. control of drug abuse
would receive top priority in his
administration.

“I oppose vigorously the le-
galizing of marijuana,” Broder-
ick declared.

However. he maintained: "Per
haps the most glaring incongru-
ity in our laws has been that
those selling massive doses of
such dangerous drugs as LSD
and 'speed‘ get off with a slap
on the wrist. while some judges
throw the book at the teenager
caught with a marijuana cigar-
ette. The penalties should bear
a rational relationship to the
crime."

Broderick is also opposed to
higher pay or increased expense
accounts for legislators and/or
top state administrative officials
and to giving teachers a limited
right to strike.

He favors reducing the size
of the state legislature. complete
financing of the welfare system
by the federal government. con-
tinuing the states extensive high-
way construction program. strict-
er enforcement of, pollution regu-
lations. intensifying efforts to
eliminate the causes of crime.
court-approved wiretapping by
the state police. increased aid to
nonpublic schools. and allowing
public employees in organized and
bargain collectively.

the

The most important task
ing the -next governor of
Commonwealth, according to
Broderick, is to “provide the
people of Pennsylvania with
the essential services they want
at the lowest possible cost.”g

Syracuse Threatens
Panther Win Streak

by JERRY MYERS

Pitt continues ‘the battle to
‘retain supremacy in the East
tomorrow against the Orange-
men of Syracuse in Archbold

Stadium. the oldest concrete
structure of its kind in the
United States.

Preparing for what may shape
up as the deciding contest in
the Lampert Trophey voting.
the Panthers will tackle. in Pitt
assistant Coach Paul Kemp‘s
words. "the strongest physical
team we've met this year."

Combining that information
with the fact that the Panthers
had trouble moving the ball on
the ground against a physically
big team. Miami (107 yards
rushing in 52 carries). makes
this contest a very interesting
one from both teams‘ stand-
points.

Sporting a five-game winning
streak the Panthers will enter
Saturday’s gamewith a-full con-
tingent of athletes. No‘ serious
injuries marred last week’s Mi-
ami encounter, and for the first
this season the Panthers are in
good shape physically.

In addition to the lack of
injuries as a result of the Miami
game. Pitt will most likely have
the services of quarterback John
Hogan. linebacker Joe Carroll.

Hall. Hall and Hogan failed to
dress last week and Carroll has
been suffering from a severe
charley horse.

Whether Hogan returns or not
will not affect the quarterback
situation. though. since Coach
Carl DePasqua has made it
clear that Dave Havern is his
starting signal-caller. The possi-

bility of Hogans return makes-

the Panthers much more potent
by expanding the attack to in-
clude an added passing threat.

Syracuse, on the other hand, is
riding on the crest of a winning
streak of their own. Overcoming
early-season difficulties the
Orangemen have rolled-u$ victor-
ies over Maryland (23-7), Navy
(23-8) last week, and a big win
over Penn State, (24-7).

One year ago the Panthers

-upset the Orangemen 21-20 at

Pitt Stadium in what was the
biggest win of Pitt's 1969 sea-
son.

We're not as good as last year."
Schwartzwalder commented

   
      

The Panther 28-17 win over Miami last Saturday brightened the
Pitt grid image nationally. but apparently didn't help much in the East.
Carl DePasqua‘s Pitt squad moved up to the 15th position inithe

Associated Press national college rankings and entered the United
Press International poll for the first time this year. reaching 18th

place.

In Lambert voting. however. the Panthers no longer claim sole

possession of the top rung. Unde~ ’

feated Ivy Leaguer Dartmouth
tied the Cats for E
acy this week.

The oddsmakers
seem to agree 
that the Panthers ._ 
just might not be ‘-
the best football
team the East has
to offer. Early re-
ports favor Syra-
cuse by one point
over the Panthers
in this Saturday’s pairing of the
Eastern rivals.

This news could be amusing to
Panther fans. especially with
Syracuse rated eighth in this sec-
tion the nation. But the Orange-
man coach. Ben Schwartzwalder.
says he isn’t surprised at all.

“I, used to say if we ever were

 

h ‘ playing Green Bay at Green Bay

we‘be favored." the veteran
coach kidded writers during a
telephone interview at Tuesdays
Babcock Room football uncheon.

The Orange mento-of seasons
knows that being favored isn't the
best thing that can happen to a
football team.

He need only think back to last
fall around this time of the season
when his squad came to Pitt Sta-

dium favored heavily over the

men with a second quarter rally.
and the Panther 21-20 victory
became the greatest win to that
point in DePasqua's life.

Not even that far back.
Schwartzwalder and his gridders
journeyed to ‘University Park.
Pa.. two weeks ago as decided un-
derdogs against Joe Paternos
Penn Staters. The Orange won.
24-7.

“I had no hope of beating Penn
State,” Schwartzwalder reflects
upon one of the great moments
for one of his teams. “It was the
biggest surprise of my life—ffot-
ball wise.”

Odds. of course. aren't made
for the coaches. DePasqua won‘t
be given that one point when his
team walks onto the field Satur-
day. But the man the odds are
made for—the wagerer—knows
how incorrect they can be.

* it It

One thing is certain. The Pitt-
Syracuse game is important for
the Panthers. Besides a mamouth
foe in Notre Dame appearing on
the schedule next week. Athletic
Director Casimir Myslinski men-
tions that a win this Saturday can
put the Panthers in a position to
challenge someone for a possible

thsa. 6-  

 

 

about his '69 squad. "This team-
we maybe don't have as much
talent as last year but the-boys
are hustling more. We're not as
fast as we were to start with
this season. "

The loss of speed in the Syra-
cuse line-up is due to the loss
of their first string quarterback,
Randy Zur, and the doubtful
status of their top running back,
Marty Januszkiewica. Janusz-
kiewicz broke a finger last week
and sat out the last half of the
Syracuse-Navy game. Schwartz-
walder was very vague about
the present status of their vfull-
back.

More specifically. the Orange-
men are “basically ‘a running
team. They run right at you.
and the team is getting better
each week.“ said Coach Kemp.
"They are really going to be
the type of team that lines up
and comes right up at you."

With the aid of a soccer style
kicking specialist. George Jako-
wenko. who booted a 47-yard.
a 48-yard. and a 39-yard field
goal last week against the Mid-
dies. the Orangemen become a
threat to score from anywhere
up to fifty yards away from the
goalline.

DePasqua is very concerned
about the strength that Syra-
cuse displays. He also is aware
of the mementum that they’ve
developed over their last three
games.

“I think it‘s gonna be a
close ballgame. They're a bet-
ter defensive team this year than
they were last year." he said.
"What they lack is good speed.
Without Zur the possibility of
defending them is easier."

Essentially Coach DePasqua
is concerned with keeping the
Orangemen in poor field posi-
tion. -

"Their kicker is a tremendous
advantage." he said.

CHARGING on Miami quarterback Kelly Cochrane (16) last Saturday is

Panther linebacker Dave McGrath (41). McGrath recovered two fumbles
in that game.

Dave McGrath
Calling Signals

by JERRY MYERS
Surveying the defensive corps of a football squad. the line-

backing team probably maintains the most strategic position on the‘

field. being forced to guard both against the run and the pass.

Nailing down the right linebacker position for the Pitt Panthers
is a guy by the name of Dave McGrath. who has been forced to as-
sume the role of ‘the other linebacker‘ for the majority of two years
now.

Anchoring a trio that consisted of Geoff Brown. Ralph Cindrich
and himself. McGrath basked in the reflected glory of the 1969
stafs. This year he has assumed a similar position alongside of
Cincrich and Joe Carroll. The V
injury to Cindrich. though. has
promoted Dave to the position
of defensive captain. which
means he relays the- defensive
plays to the squad on the field.

Bothered by a charley horse
in his right thigh, McGrath has
had an eratic season. Against
Miami he seemed to have come
around and he helped hold the
Hurricanes to 84 yards gained
on the ground.

"Basically. Miami was the
hardest game we played this
year." Dave said. "Their backs
had as much raw speed as
West Virginia."

Unlike West Virginia. Miami
had very little success with the
wide sweep. or the play-action
pass play. Both these plays must
be turned in by the outside line-
backer with the help of the de-
fensive end.

DAVE McGRATl-I
The Other Linebacker

injury has had some affect on
the defensive squad. McGrath
commented that the pre-season
All—American candidates re-
placement. sophomore George
Feher. "is getting better every
week. Hes reading defenses
better. All of us realize that

“I was a little more con-
scious of the outside run against
Miami. West Virginia is a lot
quicker than Miami once they
get outside,” he said. “The play-
action pass is the toughest for
me to defend. That and the
option, when I have to drop

 

 

back and cover the pass/’.

REGGIE FRYE
This Week's Star

Panther sophomore de-
fensive back Reggie Frye
was selected to this week's
Eastern College Athletic
Conference Division one
"Star squad" after his per-
formance against Miami.

In the. game Frye inter-
cepted two Kelly Coch-
rane passes and was involv-
ed in twelve tackles. six
solos.

The selection marked the
first time Frye has made
the weekly team.

One another Panther was
tapped by the ECAC. Lloyd
Weston. defensive star. was
named to the honorable men-
tion list.

Ralph's out so we all pick up a
little. I mean. when you re-

place an All-American. you can't '

expect the same performance.“

Syracuse could be the rough-
est game the Panthers have en-
countered this season. McGrath
himself. and the rest of the de-
fensive corps. is looking for a
real hard-nosed contest.

“You have to get a tougher
mental attitude,” Dave said.
“We’re not worried about the
passing too much, 13 is about
all they average. We're just
gonna line-up there and see who
wants it more. Whoever wants
it is going to win.”

‘Bowl-tal.' which has been cir-
culating around campus with
ever-increasing intensity has fail-
ed to get the Panthers cocky. The
reaction of Pitt's linebacker to
the possibility was that. now is

not the time to worry about them. '

"If you get caught looking
ahead. and someone knocks you
off. it doesn‘t matter anyway."
McGrath commented. .i'Besides.

Runners’

Philosophy

by MARTY HELLMAN

For the past seven years. both Jerry Richey and Mike
Schurko have been known to area sports fans as brilliant track
and cross country competitors. In high school and college they
have compiled a superlative record in both sports.

Besides their similarities in running achievements. Jerry
and Mike have extended their athletic backgrounds into their
lives by developing personal philosophies concerning running
and how it fits their individual personalities.

"The most important thing for me is that running is a-con-
tinuum as far as personal interest." Richey said. "At times, I‘d
rather run or think about running than anything else. Then I'll
fluctuate to a period where it is relatively unimportant."

Because of his “ups -and downs,” Jerry fells that he has
been unable to tap all of his ability and for that reason, he be-
lieves that his success is relative.

Schurko defines his philosophy on running in terms of his

-— total concept of man. "I feel a true man should strive for excel-

lence both physically and mentally." he stated. "and for me run—
ning becomes a way of life."

Both of them share similar attitudes towards the necessity
of keeping fit physically, but disagree over society's opinion of
that value.

Whereas Richey sees a “rebirth of attention” to this goal in
the past decade, Shurko believes that too many people are com-
placent about their own fitness and are satisfied to be more

‘ spectators of other athletes.

Interestingly enough, the two have taken parts of their ideas
from Percy Ciratty. an Austrailian coach, who Schurko des-
cribes as the "greatest athlete who ever lived."

"1 learned from him to make all of my decisions by the laws
of nature." he commented. "He taught his students to expend
maximum effort in everything."

Richey chooses “to apply his (Ciratty’s) teachings when I
feel that they are applicable. But what he says can be carried
over into just about anything.”

Throughout their careers, they have both made sacrifices
to become good runners, and neither of them now regret it.

Jerry cited Hegels belief that man has to limit himself in
order to be good in anything. Although he enjoys all sports, he
realized that his potential lied in running.»

Mike admires the sport of running because “there is no tal-
ent in running” as opposed to needing it for other sports. “Abil-
ity has nothing to do with it, but the effort involved is most im-
portant.” .

The two view the actual sport of running in different lights.
"I think of running as an art form." Richey commented. “Some-
times you can either have a masterpiece, or just another assem-
bly line product depending upon how much pain you are willing
to take on a particular day."

"I see running as a life struggle," Schurko related. “One
must be seriously willing to devote much effort and desire to it.
Because of my participation in running. I get an extreme thrill
from any great athletic endeavor.“ '

Perhaps Richey summed up his and Schurko's feelings.

"Why not," he said. "There is no sense in going through life
just being a bore." ‘

Maybe all of us can learn a little from that philosophy. _

Cubs Seek lst Victory

At Stadium Tomorrow

by MARTY HELLMAN

The freshman football team
will make its debut on the Astro-
Turf at the Stadium tomorrow af-
ternoon at 2 p.m. against Kent
State frosh.

This will be thesecond game of
the season for the Cubs. Three
weeks ago, the West Virginia Lit-
tle Mountaineers downed them.
21-10. at WVU.

Coach Bill Quinter does not
know much about the junior Gold-

en Flashes except for their rec-»

ord this year and information
about a few-of the players.

“They have lost both of their
games so far,” he said. “Bowling
Green, who has a good team beat
them, and they also lost to Ohio
University, 20-16, on the last
play of the game.”

Quinter’s knowledge of their
players is mainly limited to the
offensive squad. The quarterback
is supposed to be pretty good," he
commented, “and they have a

couple of good backs.“
As far as the KSU defense is
concerned, Quinter remarked,

Riﬂers Face

Duquesne In  
4th Contest

On Monday the Pitt rifle team
will be seeking their third win of
the season against one loss. Their
opponent will be Duquesne who
has a record of 1-0.

The teams are evenly matched.
Sgt. Bill Fauzey of Pitt and Capt.
Bechtold of Duquesne (both new-
comers) have quite a job in store
this season as both squads are
small and the reserves lack depth
and experience. Duquesne only
has one reserve while Fauzey can
only count on three.

The match is to be held at 6
p.m. at Duquesne.

The cross country team has
decided not to return to Buf-
falo, N. Y., for the Canisius In-
vitational scheduled for this
Saturday.

"the middle guard for their squad
is highly rated."

~Several changes will be made
in the starting lineup for the Cubs
this week. Bob Medwid, who com-
piled 225 yards in total of-
fense as quarterback in the WVU
game, will take a back seat to Rod
Huth. -

"I want to give Huth a chance
to play instead of playing Med-
wid," Quinter remarked.

Also, several members of the
defense squad in the WVU game
are being shifted to the offensive
lineup.

Quinter does not feel that the
three week layoff between games
will hurt the performance of the
Cubs.

‘'1 think we'll improve over the -

last time because we have had a
chance to work on fundamentals
that we were not able to do before
the last game," he concluded.

Against WVU, costly fumbles,
interceptions and penalties by the
Cubs opened the door for the
Mountaineers to score twice.

Admission to the game will be
free and anybody wishing to at-
tend must enter through Gate 3.

Boaters Use Strong

Defense At

Grove City

by STEVE zvcu

Though they didn't get a shutout Tuesday, as they were hoping they
would, the Pitt soccer team defeated Grove City, 3-1, at the Mercer
County schools soccer field, before a crowd of several hundred fans.

The scoring was initiated by Tony Nicholakopulos at I5_: 22 of
the first period when he dribbled the ball past the entire Grove C1ty‘de-
fense and put the ball behind a stunned Bob Veitch, the Grovers’ goalie.

Veitch was even more shocked on the next goal, a quick shot by‘A1i
Roissi afterla pass by Gus Theofilos who had dribbled d_e£p_ into enemy“

territory, drawing several oppon-
ents toward him. Rdissi then
passed the ball toward the tall
Tunisiam who was all alone in
front of the net. It was Ali’s fifth
goal.

After Mark Szymanski of Grove
City, a Fox Chapel native, broke
Kerry Krause’s shutout in the
third period on a corner kick, Pitt
countered with a goal of their own
when Randy Dry scored his first
goal of the year.

The goal came after Chu Cho
Valencia arched a perfect pass to
the lanky senior for an assist.

The remainder of the game was
mainly a defensive battle with
Jerry Kruth and Gary Midock of
Pitt and John Zulic of Grove City
excelling.

Though the team won, their
coach, Leo Bemis, felt that the
game should have been a rout.

After Losing Game

by CHUCK STEEBER

Stratford had just lost to Key-
stone House. 13-0 but they fought
back in their second game of
Monday afternoon to a 12-7 vic-
tory over Pleasure Palace.

Dennis Bucchi of Stratford
hit Bernie Logan in the end
zone to start off the scoring.
Later in the first half. Dennis
Bucchi again threw the foot-
ball. Larry Eaton accepted the
35-yard touchdown pass. Strat-
ford failed to connect on their
2-point conversion attempts.
Pleasure Palace remained score-
less through the first half.

In the second half. Pleasure
Palaces Bill Austin threw to
Chris Thorsen for six points.
Thorsen kicked the extra point.

A pass to Thorsen was broken
up by Tim Hormel. but a penalty
was called on the play.

As a result of the penalty.
Pleasure Palace was 15 yards
closer to the goal and in good
field position but a strong Strat-
ford defense killed their hopes
for a touchdown at that time.

Going into the final minutes
of the game. it was an_vbody's
game.

Pleasure Palace was just one
touchdown from victory. but
lost the ball on downs. Strat-
ford then took pssession and
ran out the clock.

Final score: Stratfore 12. Pleas-
ure Palace 7.

Because we're a groovy cleaner. We
know how to polish the mirrors on a
pailleted vest. We know how to clean
around the nailheads on a nailheaded
jumpsuit. We know how to keep a silver
coat silver. a suede skirt suede-y, a
mini-dress in mini-shape. If you're a
groovy thing (or belong to someone
that is), do the dry cleaning thing
with us. it's a beautiful experience.
