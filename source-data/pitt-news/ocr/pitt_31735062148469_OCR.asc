Narick Reopens Drive
To Honor Sutherland

By Georgia Shuset

Out of the attic slinks a rumor.

It shakes itself free from cobwe bs and dust. exercises its rusty joints,

and——whattyaknow?
Fund!

It’s the rediscovery of the Dr. Sutherland Memorial

For Emil Narick, BA40, chairman of the drive, will call his committee
to action some time this week, after eight months of inactivity. At that
time -plans will be formulated to establish some sort of a memorial to
“Jock” with the money that was collected.

JOE KRISTUFEK
Panther club prexy

Kristufek Wins
Panther Club’ s

Presidency

Joe Kristufek, C40, was elected
president of the Panther Club, un-
dergraduate lettermen’s organiza-

tion, at a meeting ofwthe group’s_,

executive A council Friday.

Original organizer of the club,
Kristufek has served on the varsity
tennis, basketball, volleyball, track,
and cross—country teams, managed
the wrestl.ing team, and coached the
freshman tennis team.

The Panther Club is the Univer-
sity counterpart of such lettermen’s
groups as the Michigan “M” club.
All men who have won varsity let-
ers are eligible for membership.
Only other requirement is the an-
nual payment of a 50 cent registra-
tion fee.

As the constitution states, “The
purpose of this club shall be to es-
tablish a stronger bond of unity
among the lettermen on the campus,
to promote the interests of athletics
in the University, and to add the
collective voice of athletes in fur-
thering the general welfare of the
University.”

Ofﬁcers of the club are the presi-
dent, six vice presidents represent-
ing separate varsity sports, and a
permanent secretary-treasurer, The
latter has not yet been chosen, bu.t
will be a member of the athletic
department.

These eight men make up the
executive council, which has gen-
eral charge of the actione of the
club, subject to the approval of the
entire membership.

Insignia of the club is a gold lapel
pin, consisting of a gold panther
climbing through a blue P.

Lost Nation

Official Notes Polish Room’ s
Great Value to People, Culture

The Polish Room will become of
“great sentimental” value and the
museum pieces and Reniassance de-
sign will be of “profound value” to
the Polish people and culture, said
Michael Kwapiszewski, counsellor
of the Polish embassy in Washing-
ton, is an interview before Friday’s
Polish room dedication.

Kwapiszewski, vice president of
the Polish-American society which
helped with the plans of the room,
says that Americans should be
thankful for their universities. The
University of Crakow, founded in
1364, “has never been closed a day”
until the Germans shut its doors
and “pulled down the blinds” after
the invasion.

The true function of the Jagie1-
lonian globe was discovered when
Henry Waldyn made the reproduc-
tion, which took four years, for
the University’s classroom, accord-
ing to Kwapiszewski. 3

When he was informed that the
Polish room_ was the .ninth of the

seriesof 17’ nationa‘lity“ro'oms, the A

“second in command” of the embas-
sy responded, “Well, I am glad it

wasn’t the last.” He saw the Ca-
thedral in 1933 when it was in the
early stages of construction.
Kwapiszewski was the first rec-
ognized Polish official after the last
World War. He originally came to
the United States to supervise the
World’s Fair Polish pavilion.

Alumni Adopt
New Budget

Changes in budget expenditures
of the General Alumni Association
ranging from a 9 per cent increase
to a decrease of 100 per cent on in-
dividual items have been announced
by Eugene Burkhart, ’36, acting
secretary.

Large reductions in expenditures
for printing the Alumni Review, for
salaries, for promotional purposes,
and smaller reductions in other
items have reduced the-annual bud-
get of the association from $26,487
to $11,480, a decrease of over 50 per
cent this year.

On March 22, 1939, eighteen days
after “Jock’s” resignation, a drive
was inaugurated to raise funds for
a lasting tribute to Dr. Sutherland.
Goal——$7,500.

Narick was selected as chairman
of the movement, and Chancellor
John G, Bowman launched it with
the ﬁrst contribution.

Then the committee went into
action. A large football—shaped box
was placed in the middle of the
Commons Room of the Cathedral,
and contributions were slipped
through the opening of the box.

Funds from the drive were to
have gone toward the purchase of a
bronze bust of Dr. Sutherland. The
surplus in the form of a cash award
was to have gone to the senior
iootball player with the highest
quality point average.

But March 30 saw a change. The
committee. decided to change the
memorial from a bronze bust, to a
room commemorating Dr. Suther-
land. The surplus was to have
ﬁanced the inscription of the coach’s
name in the room.

Contributions from students, fac-
ulty members, honorary and social
fraternities, and other campus or-
ganizations, poured into the fund’s
headquarters, but the goal of $7,500
seemed unattainable.

After a few weeks stories about
the drive didn’t ‘appear any more,
and contributions c-eased.

The goal was not reached. The
results were disappointing. But the
money that was contributed to the
fund has not perished from the
earth. . .  _. .

The future of the fund will be
determined by the members of Na-
rick’s committee. Then a ﬁtting
testimonial to the immortal “Jock”
will ﬁnd its place in the Univer-
sity’s Hall of Fame.

Address Today

Prisoner Under Nazi
Regime to Discuss
Affairs in Germany

Internationalism will be featured
again today when Inquiry Forum
presents German exile Dr. Paul C.
Kiess, revealing why “I Took No
f:Oath to Hitler,” at 1 o’clock in 132
Cathedral.

M Speaking under the auspices of
the American Committee for Chris-
tian German Refugees, Dr. Kiess
opens the ﬁrst program of the sec-
ond semester series of forums, de-
bates, discussions and symposiums
presented under the sponsorship of
the YM—YWCA, open to the faculty
and student body.

Dr. Kiess,» born in Berlin of un-
mixed German ancestry, obtained
his ,doctorate in jurisprudence at
the University of Jena where he
took up the practice of law.

From 1920 to 1933 he served as
a member of the Thuringlan state

parliament and taught political
science in the popular evening
schools, Germany’s outstanding

form of adult education,

In 1933 Dr. Kiess jumped into the
world’s headlines, when he served
as defense attorney for Dr. Phil
Kuno Fiedler, an Evangelical min-

ister, who refused to teach phrases

of hatred against the English and
French, in violation of Nazi ordi-
nances. Although put under protec-
tive custody, Dr. Kiess determined
to continue the defense. Immedi-
ately after his defense speech he
was conﬁned to a concentration
camp.

On subsequent release, Dr. Kiess
escaped to Czechoslovakia in 1936.
After studying and serving as aide
to lawyers in Netherlands, Geneva,
and Paris, he came to the United

 in 1.938 and applied for citi-

zenship, launching a lecturer tour.

Thoroughly acquainted with
many phases of German affairs, Dr.
Kiess has spoken to many organiza-
tions in the Pittsburgh area on Ger-
man and European problems.

SFA Appoints Starzynski Head

Of Drive on Campus for Finns

Approval of the plan of the SFA executive committee to assist civilian
sufferers in the Russo--Finnish war by sponsoring a campaign on campus
has been made by Rufus H. Fitzgerald, University provost.

It was decided at the executive committee meeting last Thursday to

invite Ted Starzynski, C40, to head
the campus campaign, similar to the
nation-wide Finnish Relief Fund
initiated and headed by Herbert
Hoover.

Plans have been made to permit
contributions, not only by the day
school students, but also by those
attending classes in the evening di-
vision.

Discussions as to the possibility
of a University delegation attending
a conclave of approximately 50 col-
leges and universities in Western
Pennsylvania brought no deﬁnite
decision from the group.

Purpose of the meeting, scheduled
for the Penn State campus in the
latter part of March, is to establish.
a permanent organization among
the schools to discuss the various
types and successes of student gov-
ernment groups in the schools.

Patrick Cusick, E40, president,
will take» charge of the famous goal-
posts, which changed hands so many
times back in October after the Pitt-
Tech game. The student govern-
ment organizations of both schools
decided at that time to eliminate
the riots and pre—game “incidents”
that damaged school and private
property.

At that time a pledge was made
between the University representa-
tives and those of Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology to award the
goalposts yearly to the school that
won the annual intersectional game.

The committee will investigate
the proposed placque to be placed
on the goal posts.

A plan to move the annual elec-
tion of student oﬁicers up to the
latter part of March was considered,
but not deﬁnitely decided. This
would enable the newly-elected of-
ﬁcers to become better acquainted
with the work required of them as
members of SFA or other student-
governing associations.

‘Big Name’ Bands
And Dance Losses

Paying the bills and balancing the books are
thejonly jobs left to be done for last Friday night’s
Heart Hop. If this dance follows the precedent of
former years, tl1e result will be a tidy proﬁt‘ for the
women’s classes.

Today, publicity and ticket sales for next Fri-
day’s Interfraternity Ball are moving into high
gear. If this year ’s edition of the Greek affair fol-

cessful dance, with a nice red loss ﬁgure 011 the

for “big name” bands.

five have had big name bands during the past few
years——the Interfraternity Ball, the Military Ball,
Freshman, Sophomore and Junior Class Dances.
Ofthese, only the Military Ball has made money
more often than it has lost during this period.

"Less pretentious dances on the University cal-
endar, such as the College and Engineering Dances,
and the I—F Yuletide Festival have had less trouble
making both ends meet‘.

Most important factor in any dance budget is
the orchestra.

- For the biggest dances, “big name” -orchestras
halvegbeen paid from $500 to $2,000.

This is a tough problem for dance chairmen to
solve. Unless the aﬁair can boast of a “big name”
orchestra, it‘ doesn’t rate as an outstanding dance.
Yet if the “big name” orchestra is hired, the dance
will probably lose money.

Pitt students may be forced to decide which
they want for dances: a local band and a proﬁt
or a “big name” band and a loss. If we had the
solution to this problem, we’d leave the newspaper
business and go after a dance chairmanship.

Whiatw-of Conquered
People? Zia-hind Asks

By “Senator” Ziskind

The world pays little heed to a struggle far more
gripping and terrifying than the actual warfare of the
Mannerheim and Rhineland fronts. It is the struggle
of the men and women and children behind the Ger-
man front who have of recent date become incorporated
into the German Reich. They, by far, are worse off
than the Chinese or even the Finns who ﬁght merciless
invaders—-for these German subjects can’t ﬁght, can’t
resist, or even utter an audible word of protest.

I ask, what has become of the Czechs and the Poles
since Hitler swallowed them up? The usual source of
such information, of course, is the press. But no, the
German Government prohibits foreign journalists from
entering these stricken lands. Only meager scraps of
information leak out, from Red Cross workers, the Sal-
vation Army, and official announcements, and these
pieced together tell a tale as grim and foreboding as
has come to light since the Dark Ages.

Kerr Hitler is out to despoil whole populations.
The mysticism of the “Blond Beast” of Neitsche who
shall rule the world, and its accompanying dogma of
the supremacy of the “aryan” race have become the
scourge of the Poles and Czechs who each day, by

the thousands, fall victim to their ghastly application.

Whole peoples have been uprooted and cast adrift
as nomad tribes, shorn of all their property and sav-
ings. Forty thousand refugees, driven out of Slovakia
and refused entrance into Hungary, living in a virtual
no-man’s land in shabby tents, refused food and cloth-
ing, rapidly wither away. To pay for a “crime.” one
out of every ten Czechs of a town, selected at random,
are immediately executed. Men of medicine, men of
law, professors, scientists——all fall under the doom of
the Nazis.

Hitler makes room for his German compatriots.
They are, as Neitsche indicated in his great myth, the
superior men of the world. So they may not speak
with Poles or Czechs. When riding in cars or buses,
Poles must go to the back——-Germans must stand up
front. Polish and Czech property is conﬁscated and
delivered over to business men of “aryan” blood. Cath-
olic priests and churchmen are subjected to extreme
humiliating treatment. Ah, but the pure blood of
aryanism has not found itself too pure to refrain from
subjecting the youthful women of Poland to wholesale
conditi.ons of rape and moral depredation.

No wonder scores of suicide notices have become
routine reports. No wond-»-er, a Czech worker in the
Skoda munition works seized a machine gun and
turned it on a mass of parading German soldiers, kill-
ing over seventy before he, himself was killed. No
wonder a thousand Czech students barricaded them-
selves in the university building and shot it out with
German soldiers until eight-hundred of their number
had been slaughtered.

Let you who criticize Great Britain and France as
“waging an imperialistic war” remember these hapless
millions. Remember that ﬁfty—million human beings
wait-—for their li.beration!

So march on! March on ye legions of France and
Great Britain! Yours is the destiny to lift Europe up
from its dismal abyss of barbarity!

Kwapiszetvski Gives Address
At Polish Dedication Ceremony

By Fred Lange

Speaking at the dedication of the
Polish room last Friday evening,
Michael Kwapisz-ewski, counselor
of the Polish embassy, Washington,
D. C., said that the classroom be-
comes of “greater value than could
have been foreseen.”

The original Jagiellonian glob-e
and the painting of Copernicus,
copies of which are found in the
room, have been taken into interior
Germany, he revealed.

Estreicher, professor who super-
vised the reproduction of the globe,
died in a German concentration
camp, “a victim of the terror of
Gestapo,” Kwapiszewski announced.

“The Polish room has already to-
day a museum value and is a docu-
ment o:f friendship between the

people of Poland and the United
States--a friendship which is the
more valuable, the more tragic mo-
ments face the people of Poland,”
said the Counselor.

“This room is the continuity of
thousand years of tradition of
Polish art and culture . . . so long
as a nation is not completely de-
stroyed . modern civilization
and all the heritage of its arts and
sciences will be carried on. Physical
violence has never accomplished
anything.” .

Kwapiszewski concluded by ex-
pressing his graitude to the Trustees
of the University. Mrs. Ruth Craw-
ford Mitchell, advisor to the nation-
ality rooms, and gave special rec-
ognition to the Polish committee

under the leadership of Dr. Teoﬁli

Starsynski and Mrs. Victor L. Alska.

Harvard Dean
Cites College
Chapel Values

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -—— (ACP)—-
American college chapels are per-
forming a vital service for the
cause of religion in being “inter—
denominational adventures in
church unity, prophetic of an in-
creasing unity among all men and
women of religious good will.”

This is the belief of Harvard uni-
versity’s Dean Willard L. Sperry,
chairman of the Board of Preach-
ers, as stated in his annual report.

“Churches which are not ready
to meet and match, in the conduct
of their own affairs, the tolerance
and sympathy which mark the col-
lege chapels, must expect to forfeit
the enthusiasm of returning grad-
uates and to suffer accordingly,” he
stated.

“The college chapels are not, as
is so often charged, the centers of
denatured religion, shorn of strong
convictions and reduced to some
lowest common denominator,” Dean
Sperry said.

“They are inter—denominational
adventures in church unity, con-
ducted under the conditions natural
to life of the place; and so far from
being treasonable betrayals of the
past, they are prophetic of an in-
creasing unity among all men and
women of religious good will.

“The American college chapel,
our own included,” he continued,
“is _a unique phenomenon in church
history, without any considerable
precedent in the past and without
present parallel in most other
lands.

“It is a meeting place for all sorts
and conditions of persons more con-
cerned for the Christian religion in
its entirety than for a particular
secretarian statement of that re-
ligion. In due time some one must
attempt to appraise the inﬂuence
which it is having upon contempor-
ary church history.

“'_I‘housands of young people go
on into life from our American col-
leges, not merely familiar with, but
be1i€Vif1g in, the non-secretarian
and interdenominational character
of the chapels which they have at-
tended in student days. If they re-
turn to the churches from which
they Came, they ask of those
churches something of the tolerance
and catholicity which they have
found in their chapels.”

Pitt Track, Field Squads Cage Team
To Try for New Track

House Records Saturday Virginians

Existing Marks in 440, Two Mile, High Jump
Endangered in University Championship Meet
By Ben Foote

Pitt track and ﬁeld athletes make their seasonal assault on the
University indoor track house records Saturday afternoon in the
eighth annual University indoor championships. ’

Marking the ﬁrst appea..ran.ce_ of the year for all Panther thin.
clads except relay men and individual sprint and weight stars, this
affair gives local track enthusiasts their initial opportunity to wit-

ness the 1940 squad in action.

‘In past years this meet has been
productive of some excellent per-
formances, and the 1940 squad must
turn in sensational times and dis-
tances to crack the present records,
both freshman and varsity.

“Dust bowl” standards most in
jeopardy include the high jump,
quarter-mile and two mile. For
two years, a great crop of quarter-
milers has failed to crack Freddy
Kiger’s ﬁve year old 440 mark of
52.9 seconds because Al Ferrara,
Bud Graf, Al McKee, Larry Tre-
gonning and company liked each
other so well they held hands cross-
ing the ﬁnish line.

Ferrara Close to Record

Since Ferrara and McKee are
seniors, they have their last crack
at Kiger’s standard. Should they
-decide to make a race of it, both
could knock the old ﬁgures into a

' AL BOULANGER
seeks two mile mark

cocked hat. In practice last week,
without too much effort, Ferrara
clipped off two furlongs in 53 ﬂat,
one-tenth of a second shy of Kiger’s
performance.

Pete Benne-tt’s high jump mark
of six feet two and three-quarter
inches should also fall by the way-
side. Dave McDowell, junior ﬁeld
star, soared to six feet three and
one-half inches last Tuesday in a
tune-up session, and may push the
bar even higher Saturday afternoon.

University Will Show
Modern Dance Movie

Movies of the modern dance and
sports will be shown today in 144
Cathedral at 1 o’clock. Men and
women of the University are invited
to attend.

Only Carnegie Tech, PCW, and
University students will have a
chance to see these movies.

In charge of the showing at the
University are Irma Hotz, Ed41;
Florence Boney, Ed41; and Betty
Rehtmeyer, graduate assistant in the
department of physical education.

Boulanger has been making rapid
strides toward good condition the
last two weeks, and seeks to add
the University indoor two mile rec-
ord to his outdoor crown. Ken
Wagenhouser’s winning clocking in
1934 of 9 minutes 51.9 seconds set
up the present ﬁgures. Boulanger
turned in the all-time Pitt low of
9 minutes 23 seconds last May in the
ICAAAA contest. '
Benghauser New Weightm-an

New comers to the Olson-coached
cinder outﬁt boost the .stock of the
weight, pole vault, and hurdling de-
partments. To supplement John
Bazyk and Ted Konetsky in the
shot put event, gridders Bill Beng-
hauser has donned spiked shoes,
and is regarded by weight-coach
Frank Bonavita as “a great pros-
pect.” Sophomore Dusty Rhoades’
proﬁciency with the iron ball gives
the Pitt ﬁeld squad a strong four-
some in this event as well as mak-
ing for a tight contest Saturday.

Rhoades again enters the picture
in the pole vault. He and sopho-
more Red Jessup leaped consist-
ently above 12 feet as freshmen, and
the hard work they have been put-
ting in may push them higher. At
least, the 12 foot 10 and one-half
mark isn’t too far out of their reach.
Soplis Threat to Veterans

Sophomores Len Powell and Bill
Cooper give veterans Joe Newman,
and the Sulkowski brothers plenty
of anxiety in the hurdle races.
These two yearlings both clear the

high barriers with excellent form,‘

and have pressed the aforemen-
tioned trio to the limit in practice.
Every timber topper will enter Sat-
urday’s race with a chance for vic-
tory. 1

Spirited competition is also ex-
pected in the freshmen events. Con-
sequently Pitt track supporters
should get a good afternoon’s enter-
tainmcnt since the affair is open to
the public.

Oilcrs Oppose
AESCME Cage
Team. Today

Another in the already long series
of intramural games between un-
beaten teams will pit the league-
leading Oil & Gas ﬁve against the
AE&ME quintet today on Trees
Gym floor.

The Oil & Gas team will be bank-
ing on Spence, Arty, and Croker to
carry them to victory over the
AE&ME squad and virtually cinch
the title.

Also unbeaten and hot on the trail
of their opponents, the AE&ME
ﬁve will count upon Shank, Howarth
and Dunbar to wrest the lead from
the Oil &. Gas boys.

Thus far, this season the Oilers
have notched ﬁve victories against
no setbacks while their opponents
have three wins out of as many
games played.

In the fraternity circuit Theta
Chi will attempt to get solace for
their setback at the hands of the
Phi Kaps against the. SAM boys.
Again the Theta Chis are counting
on “Wild Bill” Fitchko, Vetter, and
Jones for their win.

Should the Theta Chis win the
remainder of their games and the
Phi Kaps lose to the Phi Gamma
Delta ﬁve there would be 21 tie

University to Donate
Proceeds of Contest
To Finnish Relief

Pitt cagers bid adieu to their
local basketball audience when they
tackle West Virginia university to-
morrow evening at the Stadium.
The net proceeds will go to the
coffers of the Finnish Relief Fund.

This will draw the curtain on the
Panthers’ season so far as local fans
are concerned. It will also mark
the ﬁnal home stand in collegiate
basketball for Pitt seniors Charley
Ptacek. Lou Mendlow and Bob
Johnson. Ptacek is the only one
likely to see action.

West Virginia has copped more
than half their decisions, mainly
because of Homer Brooks, lanky
Mountaineer co-captain and one of
the district’s high scorers.

The Mountaineer have fared a
triﬂe better than the Panthers, win-

More had been expected of the

Six lettermen had returned,
among whom co-captains Brooks

hopes of the West Virginians never
materialized. The other returning
lettermen were Hockenberry, Sea-
bright, Mandich and McCartney.

The Panthers will seek their sev-

Entries for Spring Intramural

Program Due at Gym March 6

By John Chaffo
Spring is just around the corner and around that corner with
it is the spring intramural program, according to reports from the

intramural office.

The spring program will get under way in early March but
director of intramural athletics James Potts advises all those wish.-
ing to enter the competition to get’ their entries into the intramural

office as soon as possible. The clos-
ing date for entries will be March 6.

Four sports will feature the in-
tramural program with mushball
probably the most competitive of
them all. Horseshoes, tennis, and
golf are the other sports.

GGW’S Champs

In mushball thechampion Gamma
Gamma Woos will again be the fav-
orite in the independent league,
while the Oil & Gas team is ex-
pected to pace the Engineers, and
the Sigma Alpha Mu squad tagged
to win the fraternity circuit. In the
playoffs last year the Gamma Gam-
ma Woos took the title by upsetting
the Sammies.

The Newman Club will be out
again this year to cop the tennis
championship from the rest of the
ﬁeld in the independent section.
Delta Tau Delta, last season’s frat
winner, h.as high hopes of repeat-
ing, but this time they also hope to
cop the intramural crown.

Horseshoe competition in the Fra-
ternity league is expected to be
much closer than last year when
the Delta Tau Delta twosome of
Hamilton and Kennedy virtually
swamped all opposition.

Horseshoes for Independents '

The independents who are think-
ing of entering teams in the horse-
shoe league should jump at the op-
portunity since there was no inde-
pendent section last season.

last 10 minutes of play, Geneva’s
basketball ﬁve downed the Panther
courtmen, 47-45, last Thursday
night at the Stadium.

Held in check throughout the first
three periods, sophomore John
Billie suddenly found the range to
aid the Covenanters in scoring ﬁve
more points than their total for the
ﬁrst 30 minutes. Billie’s ﬁnal total

‘was 17 points.

The ﬁrst period found the Beaver
Falls school hitting the basket with
regularity, and they led 13-8 as the
first shot sounded. Their attack
then stall-ed, and the Panthers drew
ahead, the score reading 18-17 at
halftime.

Charley Ptacek and Solly Levin
played important roles in a third
period assault by the Carlson-
coached squad, and the Blue and
Gold held a 31-21 advantage going
into the ﬁnal canto. Ptacek added
a pair of charity tosses to the Pitt
totaltbefore Geneva staged its bril-
liant victory offensive.

Seals to Meet
Polar Bears

A change in date has two fresh-
man basketball games originally
scheduled for Wednesday, taking
place tomorrow afternoon when the
Polar Bears meet the Seals at 3:30
o’clock and the Snowﬂakes tangle
with the Defrosters at 4:30.

In the ﬁrst game the Seals, who
defeated the Snowﬂakes in their
only time out, take on the Polar
Bears, who beat the Snowﬂakes and
lost to the Defrosters.

The Seals are now deadlocked
in a three-way tie for ﬁrst place
with the Coldspots and Defrosters
who have each won one game and
lost none.‘

The nightcap brings the Defrost-
ers and Snowflakes together. The
Defrosters beat the Polar Bears in
their ﬁrst appearance and will be
trying to continue their winning
ways. They may ﬁnd some trou-
ble in the Snowﬂakes, who are"
smarting from their two defeats.

program is to give all male students
at the University of Pittsburgh an
opportunity to be a participant in
athletics, director Potts explained.
It is the policy of the University to
have a large number of students

active in athletics rather than a
select few.

According to Ralph Mitterling,
coach of Pitt’s diamond forces, all
players must have eligibility cards
ﬁlled out reporting for practice.
Cards can be obtained on the

twenty-seventh ﬂoor from Ken

F DR’s Re-election Still In Minority

By Student Opinion Surveys
AUSTIN, Texas, February 19--With political winds already
blowing in this election year of 1940, Franklin D. Roosevelt ﬁnds
himself with an ever increasing number of followers who would

like to see him run for a third term.

rank and file of voters as well 
among college students, IS still
in the minority.

The Student Opinion Surveys
of America sent its staff‘ of in-
terviewerson campuses of all de-
scriptions everywhere in the United
States to. ask a scientiﬁc cross sec-
tion of collegians, “Would you like
to see Roosevelt run for a third
term?”

Complete Record

The results, gathered and tabu-
lated at the University of Texas for
all t.he cooperating newspaper mem-
bers of the organization, show that
the President has picked up more
than ten percentage points on his
third term popularity during the
last year. Comparisons of this type
are possible for the first time now
that the Surveys has been operat-
ing without interruption since De-
cember of 1938. Following is the
complete record on this subject that
has been kept byithe Surveys:

A Third Term

For F. D. R.? Yes No
December, 193'8. . .27.2% 72.8%

January, 1939.  .28.2 71.8
November, 1939. . .3l.8 68.2,
Now . . . . . . . . . . . . .39.5 60.5

This series‘ of studies reveals a
remarkably close resemblance to the
index kept by the Gallup poll on
the same topic. Although general
opinion has always outstripped stu-
dent sentiment, 46 per cent of the
voters now wanting a third term,
the increases have been in almost
the same proportions. In January,
1939, 30 per cent of the U. S. voters
approved, as compared with 28.2
of the students.

Oppose Third Term

Although in this case it has been
shown that college students follow
the same trends of thought their
elders do, other comparisons with
American Institute of Public Opin-
ion polls illustrate the fact that
youth does not always agree with
older people. Also events to come.
here and abroad, will have much
to do in changing attitudes should
the President decide to try his luck
again.

Results of repeated interviewing
of thousands of students disclose
that many, although approving of
Roosevelt as president, are against
another four-year term. This opin-
ion was typiﬁed in the comment of
a student in Chicago’s Central
YMCA college who said, “I am op-
posed to a third term because he
would get a precedent for men who
might be less scrupulous than he is,
although I am in favor of him and
his policies.”

of “Century of College’

Mathematics

By Ray Palkot

184.4 years! That’s how long it
would take you to go through all of
courses the University offers its
students.

In round ﬁgures, you’d have to
take 55,320 credits to plow through
the total curriculum that is now of-
fered by the University.

However, if you are gifted with
the brains of Einstein, the age of
Methuselah, and the wealth of
Croesus, you could take the maxi-
mum amount of credits allowed you
by the University in its day, eve-
ning, and summer sessions and take
62 credits a year. Then you would
only have to take a 92-year course
——that is, if the courses don’t change.
Of course, 92 years from now,

Dr. Sidhu Will Speak
To Phi Lambda Upsilon

Phi Lambda Epsilon, national

sors its annual initiation banquet
tomorrow evening at 6:30 o’clock‘in
the Fairfax apartments.

Guest speaker will be Dr. Surain
S. Sidhu, physicist in charge of the
co—operative X-ray laboratory, who
will discuss “The Applicationof X-
ray Studies to Chemistry.”

chemistry, physics, astronomy, and
90 per cent of the courses you take
will have advanced and you’ll have
to start all over. Classics, we hope,
will still stay the same for a couple
of hundred years.

Under the present course ar-
rangement, the average student who
takes 30 credits of work a year, can
manage to get through all graduate
studies in a mere 80.1 years.

There will be nine two—term
presidents at the head of the United
States government by the time you
have ﬁnished your work in the col-
lege at the end of 75.9 years.

If you don’t have to take any
more English and other strictly
non—technical subjects, you will get
through engineering and mines cur-
riculum in 18 winters and through
business administration in 10.4
years.

J. G. Quick, registrar, stated that
he believed that at one time in the

future most of the University work
will be done in the Graduate School.
Perhaps, if Mr. Quick is right, after
you ﬁnish the present curricula at
the University in 92 years at the
very minimum, or 184 years at the
average rate, you can start with
graduate work and begin all over
again.
