Graduate Record
Exam is Offered’
Herc -April 24,
. Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean of
the College, announces that the

Graduate ‘Record Examination, of-

fered to Pitt students for the ﬁrst
time last semester, will be given
again on April_24 and 25. ~
The” examination is a measure
of the ability of students, regard-
less of the courses they have tak-
en, in certain general ﬁelds. It
shows the students how far they
have progressed toward their edu-
cational or vocational ‘aims and
gives valuable assistance in help-
ing them to choose their major-

ﬁelds.

Each student receives a report of
the results of his test, and a perma-
nent record is kept by the Univer-
sity. This examination is not used by.
members of the faculty as-a basis of
grading _students in their class work,

but results maybe sent to a pro-
spective employer or another school,
at the request of the student, as
proof of his ability.

The examination is given in
four hour sessions on two differ-
ent days. Students, desiringto take A
the test must register for it at the
College oﬁice at least three weeks
in advance. The procedure will be
announced in the near future.

The University makes it possible
for all advanced sophomores in the
College to take the examination
without charge. An advanced sopho-
more is a student in his fourth se-
mester, or one who has completed
"at least 38 credits but not more than
52. A fee of $1.50 must be paid by
all other Pitt students who wish to
take the test. Persons not enrolled
at Pitt must pay $3.00.

Pitt goal is “a contribution
from everybody.” A minimum of
$1.00 has been set, although many
-‘students will want and are urged
‘to give more than they did in last
year’s drive. _ - ' _

Co-Chairman Becker says, “Even
though your parents are giving to
the Red Cross Fund at their places
of employment, students’ are ‘mak-
ing this their own personal contri-
bution. Your contribution should
come. from your own budget even
tliough this may deprive you of a
few luxuries. No matter how hard
some of us work for our own money,
no matter how small our margin
over necessary expenses, we dobe-

because we are students. A dollar,

As a conclusion, to the Red

DOWN THE HILL"

By Bii.L CATROW

A-s the black crepe is tacked on
the doors of the frats that didn’t
“make out” and as a wail of mourn-
ing rises over unaccepted bids, we
begin anewour tales of woe.

Speaking of rush week, it is
hardly probable that Howdy
Brook’s complexion has as yet as-
sumeda normal hue._The tale goes
that Howdy, a_Fiji tried and true,
led George Appleton to the door
of the Phi Gam house before be-
ing informed that Appy was a
Delt active. Oh! Such embarrass-
ment. »

When ‘freshman Bob Crum came
to Pitt, he just didn’t. bother with
the co-eds that were regulars in the
Tuck Shop: He brought Gloria Con-
rad, his high school sweetie, right
with him. Kinda nice, too.

If you’ve noticed the gloomy
pan;on Lois Fair, you’ll know the
reason for all the grief when you
learn that Ted Bloomer graduated
as an engineer and passed his ﬁnal
Navy exam all in a week’s time.
Cheer up Lois, you’ll have his pin
to remember him by.

Probably you haven’t heard this
yet, but Emily Collins will be the.
ﬁrst to tell you that she has prom-
Churcliill. Just another case of
“.Horne.ToWn Boy_Makes Good.” ’

-  cording to Theodore W. Biddle,

 1 . . faculty drive. This ﬁgure includes

 V  the total value of individual pur-

chases and the amounts of pay-

"roll deductions made in January

and February totaling -$22,570.

-It excludes purchases made by the

 University. The number of per-

" sons who bought bonds through

/man A_nitavAlman, stated that this
4  figure does not include bonds bought
 «through payroll deductions of stu-
 dents’ incomes.‘ ~
"  .« ' Goal of the student drive was
- to get enough money to buy ten

Tryouts Today

‘For Lead Roles’

Three major leads "and ten sec-
ondary parts—those are the roles
open to any University student in

be presented late this spring. ’ 
Tryout for ‘these roles V will be
held in Stephen Foster_ Memorial_

‘at 3:30 o’clock today. Ed Rose,

chairman of the» committee iwhich

wrote the production, emphasizes:
“No previous acting'experiénce"-

‘ or connection with the Pitt_'Play-

« ers is pre-requisite‘ _for_prosp_ective
chst members. Only’ the general
interest and qualiﬁcations needed.‘

- for each role will govern the de-
cision." , 1'" 4
One female and two male leads

will go to the.candidates who show

the most promise. Ed ‘explains

. further:

“One male lead must have a
‘good singing‘ voice. He is to ‘be
the soldier-hero of the show. The
other male star must have a sing-
ing voice sufficient to do comedy ,
numbers. He is the No. 1 funny- "
man in the play. (___
“Thefemale lead.may or may
not be a "good singer. But she
MUST be a typical Pitt co-ed.”
Ten secondary roles—-ﬁve‘ girls
and ﬁve boys——are also open to any
student. /0 singing or acting abil-
ity is required; just a desire totake
part in the show is sufﬁcient. These
parts are in the skits and all are
minor speaking roles. “Especially
needed,” Chairman Rose-said, “are
two big fellows to play professors
and an army major."

" Tryouts for specialty numbers

and cast will continue next Wednes-
day afternoon at 3:30 o'clock in
the Memorial. A quartet, mixed

instrumentals soloists, and group
dancing specialties‘are still anted

by the Players.

,. . . Mrs Agnes Starrett

By SIGNE WINSTEIN

“How To Live On Twenty-Fowr Hours a Day,” is a publication
never intended for Mrs. Agnes Lynch Starrett. She does not need such a
guidebook. As author, advisor, teacher, and mother, she divides her time
and her energies in such a manner that in each role she is a complete

SUCCESS.

Mrs. Starrett is a native of Peru, Indiana but graduated from
Pitt with-her AB. and M.A. degrees. After teaching four years in Pitts-
burgh public schools, she turned to University teach and has been

on the Pitt faculty since 1322.

As associate professor of English, Mrs. Starrett spreads _good will

‘both within the University and with-v

out. In 1937 when Pitt celebrated its
sesquicentennial, she contributed an
inspiring narrative of the .Univer-
sity’s history. “Through One Hun-
dred and Fifty Years.” L
When a booklet or brochure is
v needed about the Darlington Li-
brary, a write-up one the nation-
ality rooms, or special programs
and tickets for the visit of dig-
nita,ries._ Mrs. Starrett plans,
,writes and edits the pieces. Her
schedule proves that if you want
something done, ask someone who
is already busy. Of her latest ,
piece, Training to -Win, a picture‘
of Pitt in ' wartime, Lt. Robert
Graham, fqrmer director of pub-
licity‘ here says, _ “It crystallizes
the University’s ideals and aims.”
,Mrs.' Starrett is best known.as
editor of Pitt, the quarterly review
of the University., Her ﬁne inter-

pretations of Pitt, expressed so‘ex- "

cellently in content and form, were
cited by. the American Institute. of

‘Graphic Arts.‘ .- .

» How Mrs. Starrett ﬁtspin her-
8:30 study periods for“Air Cadets,
‘her 10 hours a week of Red Cross U
teaching," her~English and ‘orien- V
etation classes is remarkable.

I At the ‘end of her -busy. day, Mrs.
Starrett, ﬁnds time _for_ a happy
home life in Chatham, Village with
her husband [(C.-U.) and her two
children, Clare and Dave. ,

We ~ hear that Capt. Cortland
Bacell is somewhere -overseas. He
isn’t permitted to tell where he is

enough to enable him to relate
where he has been. ' A

He writes, “Since. we left New
York two years ago, I have been in
Panama, Australia, New Caledonia,
Guadalcanal, and Fiji. Most of ‘the
islands are much the same, but for

., once, I have seen something differ-

ent——an active volcano. It is a mas-
sive thing with huge columns of
bluish-white smoke pouring from
the top. Our camp is right in the
middle of the jungle, and at night
the jungle creatures come to life!’_’

As the action sputtered about
on the stage, the insanity of the
enterprise stunned the members
of the audience who had seen other

A and better comedies. The plotis
concerned with infancy, pregnan-
cy, the servant shortage, crowded
wartime “conditions, and nearly
every situation of wartime which

" might be ‘squeezed for a laugh;

Needless to say, there‘ was‘ a

steady stream of jokes; several,

has one might suspect, were rather
smutty. ‘ A '

_ Characters marchedon and off the
stage in great emotion with such
either seriously or humorously. Dis-
organization of the affair is further
indicated by the fact that thereis
no star. The maiden aunt played by
Margaret Irving has the best" lines

is a wisecracking commentator
rather than Aa motivation for the ac-
tionA.A_Decrepit Dr. Bartell played by
Charles Burrows is the darling and
the surprise of the show but not its
star. Burrows alone performs his
part without once revolting the audi-
ence. '~ _. - . . A A
.~‘- In fairnessto the ‘play it must
' be admitted that it has possibili- c
ties, that there are some genuine.
laughs in the dialogue, and that
inferior acting has accentuated
its weaknesses.‘ Perhaps the blame
for “Three Js a Family” should
fall upon the head of the director.
Atfthis point the thought enters
my mind that there was no direc-.
tion! What else could explain‘ the‘

actors?" Among these .,were at-
tempts ' at scene. stealing-—.crudeA

attempts, at" that. _  - « ,

Also, the director‘ should have real-'
ized. that two or three’.p‘araAgraphs'

ly out of placeiﬁn any farce-comedy.
The director, if he did more than

points, of staging. Loose ends and

Despite all this there were some ’
very funny scenes, "I particularly
when the old doctor stumbled on

made him the saving grace of an
otherwise worthless evening.

. . Rambling Reviews . .

“Three Is a Family” appearing at the Nixon this week, is the mad-
dest farce to strike Pittsburgh this season. The verb “st?‘ike" intended
for literal translation. Although the play has its merits, ti .2 ﬁnal effect
is one of awe—it is not often that such a mess of plot snenks past New
York audiences without a healthy absorption-of red ink and Bronx

<9
“The Doughgirls,” which makes
a return appearance at the Nixon
next week, is claimed to be “the fun-
niest show in three years.”
‘ If that is true, the past three
years have been very sour indeed.
The advance publicity boys are also
under the misguided impression
that the play is a satire on Wash-
ington. In truth, it might with
equal _accuracy be called ‘a satire
on a playwrite. ,The situations into
which he ﬂings his characters are
very artiﬁcial, utterly lacking in
plausibility. That is, they are im-

ers who plunk green stufA‘t"into' the
box-oﬂices. However, the situation
and the humor are made’ to order
for an ambitious author anxious
to cash in. on the ﬂood ofAnondis-
criminating patronage which ‘is
now ‘ﬂooding the theater. ' 7
The core oflthe plot is as fol-
lows: Three married couples who
hhaveinot gone to .the trouble of a
legal marriage ceremony -are liv-
ing together in a_' Washington
hotel. A’ general, a Russian-ladAy
. sniper, complete: with accent and
. riﬂe, and an admiral "move in on

‘play. The girls are anxious to get.
things down on black and _ white,
but Aa number of things, such, as’
undivorced’ wives, intervene.

bility of ithe‘ plot, and most _‘au'di-’

Former Hoop Star
Compares Attacks
In Pacific Theatre

From. somewhere in the South
Paciﬁc, in language he hopes ra-
tion-conscious Americans can un-
derstand, Captain John R. (Red)
Scott, former Pitt basketball star,
compares the difference between the
invasion of Guadacanal and the
U.S. Marines’ attack on Bougain-
ville 15 months later. A

BOUGAINVILLE——Three meals
a day and regularly. »

GUADACANAL — Wondering
where your nextmeal was coming
from—-—and if you’d have to kill a
J ap to get it.

Captain Scott was with the ﬁrst
Marines to land on Guadalcanal on
August 7, 1942, in the ﬁrst Amer-
ican offensive. He also was with
the ﬁrst Marines to hit the J aps at
Bougainville. .

' “There never was a question at
Bougainville about establishing and

holding our beachhead,” ‘Captain

Scott said. “Air power and well-
protected supply lines made certain

of that,.even if we had run into in-

.itial set-backs, we ate three meals a
day regularly.” - g -

In contrast is his comment dur-
ing his 10 weeks of ﬁghting on
Gaudalcanalz p.“There were times
when our cause looked hopeless be-
cause the J aps held the numerical
bulgein shipping and-planes. We
never knew where our next» meal
was coming from and for long pe-

riods we had to depend on J ap rice

——and wondered if we’d have to
kill a J ap to get that. S

_ “There are no comparative de-
grees in jungle ﬁghting,” the pow-'
erfully built captain' continued.

“It’s all tough.” _Captain Scott’s-

outﬁt was cited on Gaudalcanal as
it “went through_the works?
