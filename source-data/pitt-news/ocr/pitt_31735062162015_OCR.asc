25¢ Time Schedule Fee Again? , Truckers’ Strike Affects

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
Spring and summer time
schedules will cost 25 cents despite
efforts last fall by student leaders
who maintained it was a student’s

right to be able to register free of ‘

charge.

Originally the charge was to go
into effect winter term, but
negotiations between vice-
chancellor of Operations Joseph
Dutton and student representatives

' successfully postponed the fee.

“We decided to postpone the
charge pending more student
input--Rege Kaufman (SGB
President) and others argued there
was not adequate notiﬁcation,”
Dutton said, explaining the delay.

The basic reason for the charge,
according to Dutton, is to save
money and put it to better use. He
noted two points of cost savings:

1) It will reduce overproduction.
Dutton insisted since time
schedules are free, they are subject
to student misuse,'resulting in
additional printing.

2) It will recover University
Dutton explained if the
money can_be saved, it can be
directed back into education‘.

Claims Sex Bias

In Federal Suit

BY THOMAS P. CLOONAN
Local feminists went to court
Monday to break through another
longstanding sexist barrier, this

one in Pittsburgh's building trades ~

unions. -
Kate Joyce, :1 25 year old
carpenter, filed a class action suit
in Federal District Court accusing
the Carpenters’ Joint Appren-
ticeship Committee and the Car-
penters’ District Council of dis-
crimination on the basis of sex.
Joyce took a carpenter's appren-
ticeship examination here two
years ago and was rejected, but
claims her performance was
adversely affected by harassment,
ridicule. derision of women in
general. and threats from fellow
examinees and test administrators.
Before she took the union exam,
Joyce had fruitlessly sought ap-
prenticeships at nonunion furniture
shops. She became interested in
carpentry while a Pitt under-
graduate involved with a work-
study program at the Wilkinsburg

Boys‘ Club.

After reading woodshop man-
uals. she began making furniture
for her home and later taught a
woodshop class at a YMCA.

When none of the nonunion
shops would seriously consider

I President Nixon.

Referring to the postponement of
the charge, Dutton said, “We
informed all constituencies that it
wasn’t going into effect until they
(students) register for fall, 1974.”

An announcement from Regis-
trar Frank Reed stated the charge
would be effective around February
19, 1974 when schedules will be
available.

There are plans to make time
schedules available in convenient
locations on a consulting basis for

t those students who choose not to

purchase one.

Student Government responded
to the announcement yesterday by
sending letters to all student
organizations requesting they

cooperate in forming an opposition
to the charge.

In the letters, President-elect
Mike Furick asked students to send
letters of dissatisfaction to Dutton,
Chancellor Posvar, Robert New-
man, President of the Faculty
Senate, and Registrar Frank Reed.

“This letter need not be long or
elaborate, just a single statement
of your opposition to the time
schedule fee. We need the support
of all student organizations in this
matter,” Furick wrote.

Student Government representa-
tives are reportedly attempting to
meet with Vice-chancellor Dutton
later this’ week concerning the
matter. _

Pa. Rep. Dent Proposes

Minimum Wage Increase

BY LEE MARKOVITZ

A bill raising the minimum wage
from the present $1.60 per hour to
$2.30 by 1976 has been introduced
in the House of Representatives by
Rep. John H. Dent (D--Pa.),
chairman of the House Labor
Committee.

Dent’s bill is a compromise to
last year’s minimum wage bill
passed by Congress but vetoed by
The vetoed bill
called for a 60 cent increase to
$2.20 by 1974..

The compromise bill would
increase the i minimum wage to
$1.90 this year, $2.10 by 1975 and
$2.30 in 1976.

“I just can’t see workers today
living on $2 an hour, much less
than the $1.60 they’re getting
now," Dent said. “People making
$10,000 in 1967 are making, on the
average, $17,000 today,” he
added. “However, people making
$1.60 in 1967 are still making $1.60
today.”

Dent said the increase would help
working students stay in school.

After the President’s veto of the
original bill, which the House failed
to override by just 23 votes, Dent
was urged to present an alternative
measure. After refusing at first,
because of irritation over the
President’s frequent use of the
veto, Dent agreed.

“Last year George Schultz con-
vinced the President to veto the bill
as inflationary," Dent said, “but
he never raised any objections to
the large increase given to civil
service employees.”

Dent is confident the House will
pass his bill. “This is an election
year and many Congressmen don’t
want to come off looking anti-
labor,” he explained.

If the bill is passed in the House,
the House Labor Committee will

'take the bill into conference with

the Senate Labor Committee which
is presenting their own minimum

Pgh. Food, Gas Supplies 3

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

The effects of a nationwide truck
shutdown swept through western
Pennsylvania with increasing
severity Tuesday as gasoline
pumps dried up, grocery shelves
stood empty and hundreds of
persons were laid off ‘jobs.

Rudy Molnar, vice president of
the Pennsylvania Service Stations
Association, said about 80 per cent
of the 450 gasoline stations in
Allegheny County were dry.

And as Pittsburgh-area residents
scrambled to get what gasoline was
left, traffic was snarled and waiting
lines of up to an hour were
reported. _

The truckers’ shutdown has
forced fuel distributors to either
halt operations completely or
severely curtail their deliveries for
fear of violence and vandalism by

dissident truckers, Molnar said.

“If this thing isn’t settled in the
next day or two, it will be very
critical," he added.

The truckers’ strike has gen-
erated a new round of layoffs in a
variety of industries and both
government and business spokes-

BY BRIAN DUNN

Student Government Board
(SGB) President Mike Furick and
the new Board were sworn in
yesterday in the Student Union
Ballroom before a crowd of about
50.

Furick summed up what he
hopes will be the essence of his
administration with a quote from
Pope John XXIII upon the latter’s
ascension to the papacy.

“We must open the windows and
let in some fresh air and let in some
new ideas.”

Furick felt the Board, under
outgoing President Rege Kauf-
man, has improved relations with
the University administration.
hope the atmosphere of working
together prevails and I’m sure it
will," he said.

Furick vowed intramurals will be
improved this year. He felt his
administration will be successful if
next year the Ballroom is filled at
inauguration, if 1,000 people,
instead of 100. apply for committee
positions, and if 50% of the student
body votes in the 1975 election.
About 25% voted this year.

“In the past few weeks, the Pitt
News has been helpful in helping
us toward this goal,” he said.

Board Members Inducted

Kaufman administered the oath
of office to.Furick, who then swore
in the new Board. The Board

members are: Pat Kablack, Bruce
Keeler, Nguyen Thi Kim Loan,
Paul Hertneky, Mary Heider, and
RuthWeimbrom.

Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs, Alfred L Moye, Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar, and Kaufman

men warned of massive layoffs if
the shutdown continues inde-
finitely. ‘

Nearly 1,800 new unemployment’ ~
_claims were filed Monday in the"
state’s Bureau of Unemployment ».j
Security in Pittsburgh because of 

the shutdown, a spokesman said. ,
William McChesney, regional

director of the state Agriculture 

Department in Pittsburgh, said,

“people” are buying everything

under the sun.”
And the Pittsburgh produce

market reported only 40 per cent of ’ ’
its normal supplies were delivered V

Tuesday with some commodities

such as tomatoes and beans‘

completely exhausted.

The rail-truck center serves

grocery stores in a three-state area 
within a 150-mile radius -of_
Pittsburgh and the effects of _thef
shortage will be felt soon in A '

supermarkets, a spokesman said.

At least six school districts were ' 

prepared to cancel classes Wed-

‘ nesday until their buses can be

refueled. Several other districts

said they would run out of gasoline‘

by the end of the week.

also spoke at the ceremony.
Kaufmann told the new Board,

“You have to work through and ,

with the administration. Any

negativism on that is going to close " 

a lot of doors we tried to open this
year.”

(Pitt News, February 4) and
suggested the Board establish a
President’ Advisory Council. The
Council would consist of “leaders
of organizations on campus the
president considers most repre-
sentative of the student body.”

Kaufman brought up the
quality of education. “I’m
wondering why a 3.6 at some US
schools isn't the same as a 3.6 at
Pitt,” he said.

“Maybe the curriculum isn’t as
challenging as it should be...If a
faculty member isn't up to
standards, he should be dismissed.

We, as the Student Government,
should defend excellence in the
classroom. '

Kaufman thanked those who
helped him this past year. He gave

special thanks to Bill Legaghan,
former assistant director of Student
Activities, for “providing us with
direction and giving more time
than could have been expected
from anybody.”

Posvar congratulated Kaufman
and told the new Board, “The door
to my ofﬁce is always open, but I’m
not always there. However, my
staff is.”

He also said, “The increased
revenues from the winning teams
we hope to have in the next few
years will be channeled mainly into
intramural sports.”

Posvar felt it was encouraging
that two freshmen (Keeler and
Hertneky) had been elected to the
SGB.

The new Board will take ofﬁce
Thursday, according to the SGB
by-laws.

M As in the case of the add-drop fee the University is confronted with
an inefficient system which they wish to streamline. We sympathize

‘with that desire. However, the problem can be alleviated through

meansother than the one the administration suggested, means which

 cause the students the least amount of inconvenience--if the

.. University would only explore those alternatives.

lntramurals:

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
The real tragedy of Pitt's
T intramural program is not the
existing inadequate conditions. but
. the absense of positive action by
those who profess sincere dedica-
' tion to reconstructing and im-
proving the system.
initially the problem, aside from
general complaints about equip-
; ment, is that there is not enough
information about the facilities
available. As IFC President Jay
Latterman pointed out in a recent
* article, 1) most freshmen do not get
V; a tour of Trees Hall or the Field
> House, and 2) (as a result). most
people are not aware of all the
intramural sports available. such as
squash.
p But aside from this point, the
a tragedy of Pitt’s intramural pro-
blem lles with the people who have
, the power to improve the system
" _ but aren’t using it.
A survey was conducted by the
Students Affairs Advisory Com-
" mittee (SAAC) last fall to deter-
mine student understanding of the
intramural system. Director Leo
Bemis was not informed of the
survey’s results-, not of a report
3, __  with recommendations written and
‘ — submitted to SAAC in November.

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  

Rege Kaufman and the Student
Government Board set as one of
their goals (as did President~elect
Mike Furick for the upcoming year)
an examination of the present
program.

Kaufman did his-homework:
other universities were surveyed
about their existing programs and
structures, and Kaufman came up
with some reasonable suggestions.
One of them was to immediately
build a small facility where
students could check out sporting
equipment, i.e. footballs, bicycles,
etc.

The problem was that Kaufman
has not yet communicated his ideas
either to Bemis or Casimir
Myslinski, the Athletic Director.
For ideas to become realities
somebody else must know about
them.

Myslinski has been another
problem. As Kaufman said last
week. Myslinski does not have
great concerns about lntramurals,
he doesn't have the proper attitude
to be handling the intramural
budget. He has ﬁguratively
handcuffed Director Bemis ‘con-
cerning the budget and he has

“instructed” him not to release
any ﬁgures. What is there to hide?

 
   
  

BY THOMAS SMITH

The election rhetoric has ceased.
It is at this time that a new Student
Government Board (SGB) must
direct its attention to the many
problems plaguing students on this
campus.

The Board should begin to act on
the problems of registration and
advising. For the most part
students are aware of these
problems, but are ignorant of SG
attempts to “change the system.”
The new Board must begin to
educate the students by informing
them of its dealings with the
University administration. SG has
never attempted to enlist broad‘
based student support in solving
these problems. Perhaps this is
one of the reasons the University
fails to reform its own processes,
and, instead, shifts the burdens of
the‘ failing system onto the
shoulders of the student body.

Students should not have to bear
the cost of poor advising and an
antiquated registration system.
Students are aware of this, but feel
powerless to ﬁght the complex and
endless bureaucracy of the Univer-
sity. SG must make students aware
of the fact that it is the means to
affect change, and that it can be a
functioning representation of stu-
dents’ needs and objectives. SG
has so little power because it has so
few constituents. It must begin to
increase the membership rolls by
tearing down the closed doors that
surround relations between Stu-
dent Government and the Univer-
sity.

For the past year the SGB has
been guilty of alienating student

\organizations from the govern-
mental processes. it has created a
growing bureaucracy that threat-
ens to engulf these organizations,
particularly the special interest
groups. This is the result of a
policy of centralization that was
instituted by SG last spring. Many
groups found it difficult to maintain
functional existence, because cen-
tralization became the policy and

not the practice. This inability or’

unwillingness on the part of SG to
insure a smooth execution of policy
has deprived organizations of the

opportunity to assume their roles
on this campus.

Centralization, however. is not
solely responsible for organiza-
tional alienation. Throughout the
year SG developed an unconscious
attitude that it had the authority to
dictate policy to groups. Power ‘of
the purse became the accepted
phrase. Though groups are funded
through the SGB, the allocations
process must be one of cooperation
and mutual respect. Groups should
realize the problems of allocating
funds. Recently, demands have
been increasing as resources
decrease annually. Student Gov-
ernment does not try to deny
groups money, but only attempts to
distribute the limited funds as
judiciously as possible.

Both SG and student organ-
izations must realize they cannot
operate in a vacuum. They need
each other. Without this cooper-

A Challenge to Cooperate

ation, respect, and trust, neither
can be effective and achieve its
goals. This restoration of a
cooperative effort between student
groups and their government
should be one of the first objectives
of the new administration.

These are the major problems
the new Board must consider, but
not the only ones. Remuneration,
programming, elections. and or-
ganizational recognition require
immediate attention. Students can
no longer accept the rationale that
solutions of student problems come
slowly clue to the red tape of the
bureaucratic system.

The Board must begin to
recognize student needs and shy
away from the cocoon-like atmos-
phere that has characterized
Student Government for the past
year. This is the challenge that
awaits seven elected students, and
it is this challenge they must accept
and resolve.

——An open letter to students——

In Opposition

As of February 19, 1974, all
students will be required to pay a
fee of twenty-five cents to obtain a
time schedule of classes. Time
schedules are absolutely necessary
for registering for classes. As
such, time schedules are a service
that should be provided for by the
University, and not paid for by the
individual students.

If the time schedule fee is
permitted to go through, it is a
distinct possibility that charges
such as the $5 add-drop fee will
begin to crop up in other areas as
well.

The free acquisition of a time
schedule is a basic student right
and necessity, like» attending
classes and meeting advisors.

Student Government needs your
assistance.’ I ask you to send letters
to Mr. Joseph Dutton, Vice-
Chancellor of Operations, 2428 CL;
Dr. Wesley Posvar, Chancellor, 107
CL; and, Mr. Robert Newman,

President of the Senate Council, a

1117 CL; and Mr. Frank Reed,
Registrar, Registrar’s Office.

This letter need not be long or
elaborate, just a single statement
of your opposition to the time
schedule fee. We need the support
of all student organizations in this
matter. Write Today. Time is
running out.

If you have any further ques-
tions, feel free to Contact me in the
Student Government Office. I
thank you for your assistance.

Student Government

In recent weeks we have received
a signiﬁcant number of “Letters to
the Editor” which were unsigned
and/or untyped.

We would like to reiterate that all
“Letters to the Editor” must be
typewritten, and they must be
signed. The name of the writer will
be withheld upon request.

is There a Solution ‘?

And Myslinski’s attitude toward
average Pitt students can be
questioned when his logic is that
“everybody should have their own
tennis racquet and balls.”

Surely another problem, as
previously stated by Bemis, is the
Physical Plant department. Bemis
insists the two all-purpose ﬁelds
should be treated twice per year to
remain conditioned. Why are they
instead being treated every four
years?

These are some of the problems
and they cannot be solved
ovemlght. But to recondition the
system it will take more than the
poor and lackadaisical attitudes
which have highlighted the effort
thus far.

Two suggestions, one by'SGB
President Kaufman. and one by
intramural Director Bemis should
be given serious thought by the
task force set up to study the
problem and make a recommenda-
tion in April.

The first idea is one expre_ssed by
Kaufman in reaction to replies
received from his inquiries to other
universities.

Consideration should be given to
the possibility of removing the
intramural department from the

direction of the athletic depait-.

ment. One obvious reason is the
position taken by Myslinski.
Another is that the intramural
system should not have to depend
on funds from athletics to exist and
expand.

lntramurals are strictly student
affairs and should not be under
supervision by the athletic depart-
ment simply because they are an
athletic activity.

it is conceivable that lntramurals
could someday be directed by
Student Affairs and some thought
should be given to the suggestion.

Another suggestion from Direc-
tor Bemis is practical in terms of
short-range necessity. The idea is
that a newly graduated physical
education major be hired as
full-time assistant director for

organizational purposes.

With the proper direction and
initiative Pitt could renovate its
program for next fall. This will
require a new and forceful posture
on the part of the new people
involved, with SGB President-
elect, Mike Furick hopefully
leading the way.

union exam as her next step on the
road to carpentry. “I was afraid to
approach the carpenters‘ union
because of their reputation as a
brotherhood,” she said.

Antagonism was even stronger
than she expected, and after
receiving a notice of failure
addressed “Dear Sir", Joyce
moved to Switzerland where she
worked as a cabinetmaker’s
apprentice for a year. '

Returning to Pittsburgh last
spring, Joyce started working to
return trade unions “to the ideals
that conceived them."

men” while many local women
seek trade jobs, she filed com-

she said, explaining why she has
gone to court. Her case is
supported by the National Organ-
ization of Women, the American
Civil Liberties Union, the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, Pennsylvanians for
Women's Rights and Pitt's Wo-
men's Center.

Kate Joyce is the ﬁrst woman to
petition for membership in a
building trades union, and a court
decision favorable to her class
action suit could open thousands of
construction jobs to women.

The suit seeks an affirmative
action plan to force construction
unions to recruit and hire women,
much as the Philadelphia Plan of
1969 forced an uncooperative
construction industry to set hiring
quotas for blacks.

expects union officials to tile a
response to the suit and various
appeals may delay the decision
several months.

Robert Argentine. executive
secretary of the Carpenters District
Council. described the appren-
ticeship test Joyce took as a
standardized aptitude test. The
first half of the test is based on
state qualiﬁcations and the second
half on union requirements. he
said.

Although test results are not
disclosed, Argentine said he
believes Joyce simply failed the
test, -and her charge of sexual
discrimination is unfounded.
“Why, hundreds of women belong
to the carpenters’ union,” he said,
“and they hold a wide variety of
jobs.” ”

Lawyer lsackes pointed out that
all of those women hold auxiliary
positions such as seamstress, and
none has ever been admitted to the
apprenticeship program.

This novel, by the author of

After the surge of theatre in the

The need for audience support
increased.

“People in Pittsburgh feel a sense

While much of the politically-
oriented content of the book is
Nabokov's creation, he writes in
the introduction that ‘ he has

i “interlarded this fantasy with bits

of Lenin's speeches. and a chunk of
the Soviet constitution and gobs of
Nazist pseudo-efficiency."

The most amazing accomplish-
ment of this fine book is that it
excels in so many ways. It has a

ated. audiences have decreased.

This is further proof that interest in
the performing arts is dwindling.

Not all areas of the arts have
suffered. though. The Civic Light
Opera, for one. drew more people
this past summer.

Increased interest in classical
music has had a favorable outcome
for the Pittsburgh Symphony. A
program to provide free concerts
for the public has proved worth-
while. Each week, the Symphony
brings its music to the people at
one of the area high schools.

The City of Pittsburgh has
appropriated funds for the building
of a 300-seat theatre. Located in

human dimension that many
political novels (a notable exception
being Arthur Koestler's Darkness
at Noon) seem to lack. The
passages about Krug and his son
David are marvelous and touching.

Besides its fine content the book
is well-written. Nabokov’s brilliant
prose is supplemented by many
puns and parodies of cliches.
Humor is also provided by a
hilarious mis’-interprleation of
Hamlet which sees Foirtinbras as
the central character.

The stylistic accomplishments of
the book are many. Nabokov's ﬁne
use of imagery should be men-
tioned. As is noted in the
introduction, a puddle observed by

The book is also noteworthy for
the freedom from which it travels

Vladimir Nabokov, with this
reissue of Bend Sinister and the
publication of A Russian Beauty

to demonstrate that he is one of the
world’s best living authors.

Bend Sinister is a wonderful
book. A fine story is told by the

BY JIM MALONEY

Ed. Note: This is the first article
in a series of articles on the
evolution of Rock ’n.Roll. From
Black country blues to the Beatles
this series will trace the most
important trends and discuss their
implications for today and to-
morrow.

"It's a mighty long way down
Rock and Roll." So goes the lyric

/‘V . .
‘bf a current song. And so it IS.

Rock and Roll didn’tjust happen.
It was the end product of a long line
of musical descent. Very black.
Very blue. While Rock drew from
the three major American musical
forms--jazz, blues, and country--it
feasted most heartily on the rich
tradition ofthe blues. Whether you
listen to The Allman Brothers or
Beach Boys, you’re hearing blues--
if only as an undercurrent. It’s a
pulse that keeps Rock and Roll
alive. A

“It's called Rock now.

1'

says

Chuck Berry. “It used to be called .

blues, it used to be called R&‘B--

,?'¥names can vary. but it's music to

dance by and pat your foot. Call it
Rock, call it jazz. If it makes you
move, it’ll be there.”

And it has been here, for a long
time. You can trace the blues to
African tribal chants, _rhythmic
patterns that inspired participa-
tion, assimilated elements of
Afro/European culture. . The
road to Rock and Roll was rough.
In retrospect, the progression from
rural black music to urban white

/ music seems almost unlikely. But
blues is indeed the life blood of just

“about anything that ;rocks, or rolls.

 

A artists

Blues covers ‘a lot of ground.
Delta Blues. Texas Blues. Chicago‘
Blues. Memphis, St. ‘Louis, and
Detroit Blues. Most of the blues
heard today are Mississippi-
influenced. From early Delta
like Charley Patton
and Son House came the blues
style that saturated Muddy Wa-
ters. Howlin’ Wolf and Elmore

James before they branched North
to fashion the urban blues out of
-zﬁtheii‘ country roots. Texas was the _
my other Southern state to send a
major crop of bluesmen North--
Blind Lemmon Jefferson and his
descendants. Texas Alexander,

‘T-Bone Walker

Lightin' Hopkins and T-Bone
Walker.

Robert Johnson’s recordings
literally define the Mississippi style
known as Delta Blues. Although he
recorded comparatively little, his
output is probably the most
significant example of the country
blues of the day. From his 1930’s
compositions come songs that
found a home in popular rock forty
years latter, “Love in Vain,” “Stop

Breakin’ Down” [Stones] and
“Crossroad Blues” [Cream].
The blues can be seen as

harboring three essential sty1es--
classic. country. and city. the

classic blues of the 1920's are most
widely associated with blueswomen

like Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and
Victoria Spivey. Most of these sold
well, although only to blacks. The
stigma of “Race” records came to
be with these early recordings.

The country blues were actually
an amalgam of just about every
traditional form of entertainment,
medicine shows, jug ‘bands, Satur-
day night fish fries. The late
twenties and early thirties saw the

fifties. This style was a direct
result of increasing black mobility.
from rural South to urban North. ,
The first trickle of this mobility saw
the recordings of bluesmen like
Washboard Sam. Big Bill Broonzy.
and LeRoy Carr. These repre-
sented the first wave of blues
records to reach the northern
“race" market.

The stigma of “Race Records”
stifled the commercial success of
most black bluesmen until the
mid-fifties. A “hit” to Sonny Boy
Williamson or Howlin’ Wolf meant
a regional hit--limited distribution
to the race markets of Chicago, St.
Louis, Memphis, and the Deep
South. Blacks who sounded
“white” or otherwise avoided a
recognizable black sound found a
white audience and a place on the
popular charts. _

Nat “King" Cole was an
example of this phenomenon.
Blacks who refused to alter their
original sound in order to be OK'd
by white radio stations simply had
to wait until 1955. when Elvis.
Buddy Holly and company sud-
denly made sounding “black" very
stylish. The racial lines that had
been etched in the face of popular
music since the twenties had
divided musicians. audiences,and
probably retarded an influence that
could have made exciting inroads
‘into popular music much earlier
than it did. But as soon as white
ears began to flap in time to the

Story of the Blues

pounding message of Little Richard
and Chuck Berry, the record
companies. and everybody else,
took a deep breath.

Nathan Davis, Professor of Black
Music at Pitt, sees that as a
breakthrough. “All of a sudden,
the record companies saw these
white kids dancin’ to the R&B
record sounds and they jumped on
it. That's why blues is the essence
of the music that hit from all sides
in ’55.”

One white DJ saw it before
anyone else. The black sound
probably would have broken into
the market sooner or
Alan Freed is responsible for
things happening as they did. In
1951. Freed coined the term "Rock

and Roll" to replace "Race
Record” and blasted it from his
WlNS—show in New York. A
handful of jockeys followed his

lead. and something a bit more
danceable than Eddie Fisher was
on the way.

By 1955. the Tin Pan Alley
influence was beginning to wear
thin. Small independent record

The Day Rock 'n Roll Begon

Blind Lemmon Jefferson

Photo: Oliver, The Story of the Blues

Memphis and Chess of Chicago ran
like a network beneath the large
companies‘ monopolization of the
commercial “white" sound.

The Rock and Roll puzzle was
being pieced together from many
different sources--West Coast,
South, Memphis to name a few.
Bluesman, Arthur “Big Boy”
Crudup, one of the most dominant
influences on young Elvis Presley,
was about to “donate" his “that’s
ALL RIGHT MAMA” as Elvis’ first
Sun release, Sun #209, an
important record in many ways.
Elvis was a young white hillbilly.
But he sounded like a black
Mississippi bluesman.

In a way. Elvis's
contribution was his impact. He
changed not only music. but
attitudes that had grown up with
the recording industry--and thus
the media and public. With fellow
blues disciples Carl Perkins. Buddy

greatest

Holly. and Jerry Lee Lewis. he
pulled black R&B from the regional
cellars of the race market into a
popular setting. The rockabilly
beat was, for most white kids. their
first peek into the dark and
mysterious world of the blues--the
first bite of forbidden fruit.
Artists like Fats Domino. estab-
lishcd favorites among blacks.
suddenly found themselves chris-
tened “Roek and Rollers" and
enroute to the popular charts. “At
one time. R&B was nothing." says
Ray Charles. “All of a sudden.
along came ‘Blue Suede Shoes‘ and

a few others. Then it became Rock
and Roll. and a big thing."

[Next issue will examine blues-
men who migrated from rural to
urban settings following WW II,
and in doing so, laid the
groundwork for the Rock and Roll
explosion that was to come in 1955.]

ected From Kent State

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

There's an expression among
children that goes, “monkey see,
monkey do." Since a Kent State
scout witnessed William & Mary's
almost successful deliberate style
of play Saturday. Buzz Ridl is
expecting a similar type of game
tonight when Pitt takes on the
Golden Flashes at the Field House
at 8 pm.

The game will have more
similarities to the William & Mary
squeaker than Pitt head basketball
coach Buzz Ridl would like to see.
The status of Billy Knight and
Mickey Martin will not be certain
until game time. Knight, who is
suffering from a bruised shoulder,
will probably play, but he will be
heavily taped. Martin's bruised
leg is not coming along quickly,
and he will probably sit out the
entire game.

Ridl doesn't want to be caught
looking ahead, but he knows that

Nick Martin V  

BY RICK STOUFFER

Possessed, adj. Inﬂuenced or
controlled by one’s passion or fixed
idea. The above is a straight
dictionary meaning but it- isn't
defining the Exorcist. It describes
one of the most dedicated track
men at Pitt, Nick Martin.

Since he was a high school
freshman, Martin has been burn-
ing up tracks as if possessed by his
own little demon. Too small for
football and basketball. Martin
turned to track just to get involved
in varsity sports, definitely a break
for Pitt.

Talking in short quick sentences,

Martin's tightly drawn face-with its-

deep set eyes holds a person in a
hypnotic trance. “I run four or five
miles every morning except the
days before a meet. The idea is to
build up my strength to the point
that I am much stronger than the
competition. I like to wear them
down in a race.”

Growing up in Pittsburgh,
Martin decided to stay and attend
Pitt. “A lot of kids graduate and

 

Syracuse, Saturday night's op-
ponent, is a much tougher team
than Kent State, and he may wish
to save Martin for that game.
Pitt's 17 game winning streak is

beginning to be noticed" by

everybody, both the pollsters and
the opponents. The Cats jumped
from 10th to ninth in the UPI poll,
and from 13th to 10th in the AP
poll. Thanks in part to Duquesne’s
upsetting Providence last Thurs-
day, the Panthers have surpassed
the Friars to be‘ ranked number one
in the East by Sports Illustrated.

“Saturday's game showed that
every team is preparing for us
very carefully,” said Ridl yester-
day. “It would be a big lift for
anybody's program to break out
streak.

“Kent State is similar to William
& Mary in several ways," he went
on. “They have some height, and
they have good guards, which you
need to play a deliberate type of
game. Neither teams‘ record is
indicative of how good they are."

The Golden Flashes are currently
sporting an 8-10 mark, having lost
four of their last five games. They
play in the Mid-American Con-
ference, and are 1-6 in conference
play. Penn State, the only common
opponent with beat, defeated KSU,
62-53.

“They have a seven-foot Cana-
dian kid named Jim Zoet," said
Ridl, “and Brad Robinson, who is
6-8, 230 pounds. They could

think it is really great to get away
from home but I figured ifl do good

in track here the people will at least‘

know who I am."

“Pitt also has one of the best
track facilities in the country,”
Martin continued. “Not many
schools have an indoor track and
our outdoor track is really great.”

Giving 100% always is Martin's
goal when he prepares for a meet.
“The two most important things for
me are consistency and confidence.
The mental attitude is probably
more important than physical
shape. You have to be in a good
frame of mind to compete."

“I know there has to be a definite
change in my performance this
year compared to last. Last year I
went from 64th at the IC4A to 8th.
The change has to come from my
mental attitude."

Some runners like to blow their
competition off the track from the
start. Martin’s idea is to lay back
and wait. “I would much rather
follow than lead in any race. When

definitely give us trouble.”

Ridl is expecting Kent Stateto
come out in a zone defense, and?
won't be at all surprised by a‘f_

momentum. But if I am chasing

work for.”

“I consider myself a good relay
runner." Martin said. "1 have to
put out effort at all times or I'm not
satisfied."

At Cleveland's “Cereal Bowl"
last week Martin ran a 9:03 which
wasn't bad considering the track.
“Cleveland was the first time Iran
on that small of a track and I
couldn't get geared to the pace. ‘
Things were just too tight with no
room to move."

With the Michigan Relays
coming up Saturday, Martin
seemed optimistic. “We’re work-
ing on our distance medley relay
for Michigan. It's looking- really
good. Michigan is a great track
with a big crowd to get everybody
up. I would like to run around four
minutes and five seconds to be

happy?’

Do Pitt Athletes Receive
Preferential Treatment?

EDITOR'S NOTE: The following
is the conclusion to an in ‘depth
investigative’ article regarding
possible preferential treatment
given to Pitt varsity athletes on
scholarship in regard to the
remainder of the student body.

BY LARRY PANSINO
Additionally, all full scholarship

athletes may use texts from the Pitt
Book Store at no cost, provided
they return the books at the end of
the term. According to a freshman
football player, the athletes need
not wait through the long lines of
students that form at each cash
register at the beginning of the
term. They may simply take their
books to a desk where the prices

are noted by an attendant.
Despite such aids. some athletes’
grades do slip. It is Rosborough’s
job to find out when this happens
and try to prevent it if possible. He
explains that the University prints
listings of full-time students and
their quality point averages. These
lists are made readily available to"

 Do Athletes Receive Preferential Treatment?

(Cmililtunl from Faye 9)

the athletic department by the

, Office of Student Records.

"My fttnction is to work closely in
counseling and fashioning players
toward earning their degrees." he
"said. "Our greatest objective is to
see them progress as student-
athletes. If a student is short of
credits. we must let him know he is
and what to do about it. But the
student is solely responsible.

"I don't work as a guidance
counselor. such as telling them to
take this course or that. I make
these students aware of the options
available to them. But if a student

gets into academic difficulty his
school deals with him and he will
be ma(le ineligible to compete."

There are strong indications.
though. that at least some grade
“fixing" by sympathetic faculty
members occurs and
graduating athletes are further
rewarded by preferential admit-
tance to sotne Pitt graduate
Schools.

A senior football player said that
two prominent professors regularly
raise low grades for athletes who
take their courses. These
professors, both holding Ph. D. 5,
give a D to any athlete who fails
one of their classes and a C to any

athlete earning a D.

A dental student at Pitt said that
he wottld not have been admitted to
dental school as soon as he was had
it not been for his successful
athletic career there and the
connections he developed through
the athletic department.

And a Pitt baseball player said he
knows a football-baseball athlete
who was given a car in addition to
his full scholarship to play for Pitt.
The baseball player said he also
knows several athletes who were
promised admittance to medical or
dental school as an additional

/recruitment lure.

Several other athletes said they‘

talked to fellow players who
maintain they had grades fixed.

Whatever the extent of these
allcgttllottsf tnost athletes agree
that many teachers give them

certain considerations because
of the time players mttst put into
their sports. Tom Perko, a starting
defensive end on the football team.
admits he talked to instructors who
say they give preferential treat-
ment to athletes. ‘

problems in the back of their

Mike Care_v added, “Some tea-
chers have helped us. such as
giving us options to take tests on
different days from the rest of the
class because of practices or away
games. But l've never heard of
being given a grade."

Dale Mikison. a former gridder.
said athletes get “special treat-
mcnt" from many teachers.

But some athletes disallow any
knowledge of such preference.
Eddie Brennan, another ex-
footballer, exclaimed, “They
couldn’t fix grades for me when I
got into trouble. They said it was
up to me.”

In fact. Art Simon. still another

former football player. maintained.

"My grades have been hurt by
prejudice against me because I was
an athlete. Some teachers might
consider not flunking an athlete
because of the time he has totspend
on the field. I've never been
handed a grade."

University Athletic Committee. a
policy recommendation body. said
that some charges are “probably
true."

Werner said his committee has
tnade no inquiry into the charges
because of "academic freedom" of
pt‘ofCssot‘s to grade as they wish.

His committee had tnade recom-
mendations over a year ago to the
University aldministration to up-
grade the football program. “If
you're going to go ‘big time’ (in
college football). it costs too much
to lose." he said.

“Western Pennsylvania has tra-
ditionally been a hotbed of football.
I think we owe it to the University
and to Western Pennsylvania to
field a representative team.”

Dr. Reuben E. Slesinger,
another faculty member of the
University Athletic Committee.
denied grade “ﬁxing" occurs at
Pitt. “We haven't had any
indications of that." he said.

In response to a question about V

allowing more time to athletes for
completion of course requirement,

Slesinger said. “It's not different .

than for any other student. We
take into account extenuating
circumstances just like for other
students."

In addition to their numerous
benefits. most athletes receive at
least some financial aid toward
their education. Athletic Director
Casimir Myslinski estimates there
are between 150 and 180 full
scholarships dispersed among the
four classes at Pitt.

An athlete under full scholarship

120 of them are allotted tofthe
football program. Under Majors,
the football team can give out 30
full scholarships each year, the
limit under National Collegiate
Athletic Association rules.
Obviously, athletes in most other
sports receive much less ﬁnancial
aid per player. Basketball head
coach Charles (Buzz) Ridl reports

’ . his team can give out 18 total

scholarships over a four-year
period, down from 20 last year.

More acute differences are felt in
other sports. Charlie Heiry said
that of the 30 members of the track
team, only 20 have either full or
partial scholarships.

Don Kennedy, a sophomore
pitcher for the baseball team, said
the limited number of scholarships
allowed his team are divided
according to age. Juniors and
seniors are given full scholarships
while freshmen and sophomores
get only half of their tuition paid
for, Kennedy explained.

Myslinski explained the eco-
nomics of granting such a
disproportionate number of schol-
arships to the football team. “We
want to build up our entire
program, including the minor
sports,” he said. “But football is
the only sport at Pitt that makes
money. Overall, we operate at a
small loss; football makes the
money to support other sports. We
have to spend money where we
make money."

He said that even such popular
sports as basketball and wrestling

/i“ break even at best and the rest of

r~_

 

the sports teams lose money. The

athletic department operation is
essentially a “business," Mys-
linski said.

Arguing that a good football team
is essential to a successful sports
program, Myslinski listed the
monetary rewards for such a team.
He said that a university makes
“$300,000 and up” from a major
bowl game appearance, $230,000
from the American Broadcasting
Co. for a nationally televised game,
and $160,000 for a regional
broadcast. It is a simple equation
ot prestige equals money.

“The money we get from the
University for our scholarships and
operations is dependent on the
amount of money we bring in,"
Myslinski said.

An attempt to gain access to the
athletic department budget to
examine the breakdown in expend-
itures was repeatedly frustrated by
University ofﬁcials. The Chan-
cellor’s office, Myslinski himselt,
and the University’s budget divi-
sion all discourage such attempts.
The probe was also stifled in
budgetary ofﬁces in Harrisburg
and by Pitt’s liaison to the state
government in the stateicapital.

Fred McLuckie, a staff assistant

for state Sen. Austin J. Murphy,
D-Monongahela, a state govern-
ment employee who looked into the
Harrisburg situation, said, “You
picked a bad time to investigate
this. It seems they [athletic
department] spent a bundle this
year. This is a ‘very touchy
situation to Pitt’s officials.”

A few years ago, the University
Athletic Committee did a study of
the athletic program. The report in
part said, “Last year (c.1971) the
total (intercollegiate sports) pro-
gram cost $1.37 million including
scholarship aid and generated over
$960,000 in receipts...The football
team last year made a proﬁt after
expenses (excluding student aid) of
over 1/2 million dollars or almost

enough to support all other-sports A

programs and intramurals..."
Myslinski said, “We are reluctant
to give out budgets because it is
easy to misconstrue them." He
added that the budgetary ﬁgures
are often misleading because they
must be “flexible” to accommo-
date the needs of the program.

A Maravich Suspended  

Atlanta AP -- Pete Maravich, one
of the National Basketball Associa-
tion's leading scorers, was sus-
pended indeﬁnitely Tuesday by
Atlanta Hawks Coach Cotton
Fitzsimmons “for disciplinary rea-
sons."

Fitzsimmons refused
borate on the reasons.

Pressed by reporters, he would
say only, ‘:There’s nothing heavy
about this. These things have to be
doneﬂ’ A

Teammates said the action was
not unexpected.

It followed a near-scufﬂe at the
Hawks game in Houston Sunday, in
which Maravich became upset after
he was assessed a technical foul in
the first half. Hawks Herm Gilliam
and Lou Hudson had to restrain

to ela-

Maravich and Hudson’s nose was

bloodied, apparently by a blow; 7‘, '_ 

from Maravich’s elbow.
After the game, Fitzsimmons
criticized Maravich’s playing . and

-said he obviously “didrft have his .

head in the game."

Maravich told The Associated I

Press in a telephone call to his
Atlanta apartment, “I really have
no comment to make on the
matter.”

He added that he had made no
plans.

A Hawks ofﬁce staffer said the"
suspension was announced shortly t

after Fitzsimmons summoned
Maravich in and had a brief private
conference with him Tuesday
morning.
