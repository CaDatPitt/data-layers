-,.-gPo|ice Labor Dispute

Moves into Hearings .5

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The Campus 'Police-University
labor dispute went into fact-ﬁnding
hearings ,Monday to attempt a
settlement over employment issues
that nearly resulted in a strike
October 26.

The hour-and-a-half meeting was 1

presided over by state ~arbitr-ator‘
who has

dation shortly, perhaps as early as
Friday.

The University and Campus
Police are deadlocked in negoti-

- ations over a salary increase, the

use of subcontracted security work‘
at the University and the hiring of
part-timers for the force.’

The Stonehouse recommenda-
tion will not be legally binding, and
the parties will have 10 days to
accept or reject the proposed
settlement, after which the propo-
sal will be made public.

“The recommendation will ‘be
coming shortly, and we'll have to

“” ” said Univer-

Tom Cherry.

“We’re really fairly close on this
issue of salary increases, and the
money seems to be the key thing
here.”

According to Campus Police
union official Robert Kolesky, the
union made an offer to settle for a
50 cent per hour increase at

Monday’s meeting. The Univer-’‘.

sity, which has proposed a 40-cent

Grand Jury Action

raise, rejected the offer. ,
“They said they wouldn't give us
another dime,” Kolesky said, “and

V we said that the cost ‘of living went

up nine percent last year and will
probably ' go up another nine ‘per
cent this year.

“We need at least 45 cents more p

an hour just to stay even.” '

. According to Kolesky, recent
University claims that the Campus
Police’“supports only 17 lieutenants
and sergeants are inaccurate, and
the true, number of supervisory
personnel is closer to 20.

“We brought out that lieuten-
ants are making somewhere around
$14,000 ' a year and sergeants
around $12,000, and that they
include 19 student security aides in
their description of the size of the
force," Kolesky said. _

Most members of the -force are
content to wait for the arbitrator’s
recommendation, Kolesky added,
and are prepared to “eat crow” if
the arbitrator decides on ta salary
increase less than that sought by
the union. .

A rejection of the recommenda-
tion would toss the problem back

_ into the negotiaton arena.

Although the possibility of
binding arbitration still ‘exists, and

‘the police union has expressed its

interest in this option, the
University contends the matter is

‘too complicated for a rapid,

decision by a third party.
“Besides,” Cherry said, “we’re
not that far apart anymore.”.

Johnson Suit Black in Court 9

I

BY BILL MOORE

The suit charging the University
with sex discrimination, ﬁled in
‘1973 after Dr. Sharon Johnson,
assistant professor in the School of
Medicine, was
returned to the courtroom Monday.

The case will continue before
Federal.Justice William Knox until

. mid-December in Courtroom Six of

federal court.

Johnson was denied tenure in
October, 1971, and after taking the
case through various University
bodies, she filed suit chargingthe
University with violation of the civil
Rights Acts of 1964 and 1966 and of
the First and Fourteenth Amend-
ments.

In May, 1973, Johnson won an
injunction allowing her to keep her
present position with the School of
Medicine until a decision is
reached and forbidding the Uni-
versity from terminating Johnson’s
research grant.

Attorney Sylvia Roberts, repres-
enting Johnson, will air the

plaintiff’s case throughout most, if e

not all, of the next two and a half

weeks of proceedings, ‘and the-
~ ' University’s case probably will not

be heard until 1976.
Pittsburgh attorneys, Charles
Arensberg, Johanna O’Loughlin,

Leonard Scheinholz and Beverly

Gazza are representing the Univer-

denied tenure, _

' attorneys

‘sity.

The case is considered importaht
because it is expected to _set Ia
precedent for sex discrimination
cases involving professional rather
than blue-collar jobs, legal experts
have said.

According to one attorney
familiar with the‘ case, much of the
attorneys’ work will center around
determining how much a part sex
discrimination played inlthe deci-
sion to deny Johnson tenure.-

The University’s and Johnson’s
were unavailable or
unwilling to comment to the Pitt
News on the case last week.

In earlier court proceedings,_
much of Johnson’s objections have’

concerned ﬁgures she cited indica-
ting that before 1973, while 30%» of
the Ph.D.s granted by the Medical

School were to women, only 2.2%,

of the tenured faculty members
were women. ' » .
Johnson’s statistics were termed
“inaccurate” and “slanderous” in
1973 by then Personnel Director
Edward Blakelywho claimed the
University had an exemplary
record for minority employment.
Dr. Donald‘ N. Medearis, then
deanof the School of Medicine,
was quoted in 1973 as saying all
actions against Johnson stemmed
from consideration of "her teaching
ability and the relevance of her
research and’ not from’ any‘
considerations of sex.

GPSA to Study Aid

Three Panthers Await Trial I

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

After‘a hearing in City Court last
‘Wednesday,

jury action February 4 in the
alleged beating of a Pitt alumnus
and his girlfriend.

The ‘allegations, stemming from
the November 15 incident, were
made by Robert Carney, 25, of
Langehorne, Pa., «and Carol Liv-

- ingston, 26, of Washington, Pa. »

The players, Tom Perko, John
Pelusi and David Treiber, did not
testify at the hearing, nor were
there any other ‘defense witnesses.

Livingston testiﬁed that Perko

H I ‘-and Pelusi broke through a line of
 ’ ‘iwaiting patrons outside the Wood-

en Keg tavern on Forbes Avenue.

She also said Perko hit Carney in
the face without provocation.

Livingston said Perko and Pelusi
later came out of the tavern and
took turns beating Carney. She
charged that Perko choked Carney
and smashed his head against the
concrete. ' .

Claiming he was unconscious
after Perko’s initial blow, Carney
gave only sparse testimony.

Carney did testify, though, that

he had been treated at Presbyt_er- -

ian-University Hospital's emer-
gency room immediately following
the alleged beating.

All three players were held on

assault charges by ‘Magistrate
Joseph Givens, although Carney

"and Livingston testified that

Treiber did not hit anyone.

contention that he was an
accomplice in the action, although

the move was contested by the-

players’ attorney, Samue1_Scuillo.
“There’s been. no testimony that
would ‘indicate Treiber should be
charged with anything,” Scuillo
said. “All action against him
should be dropped.” '
Givens ignored Scuillo’s plea and

- upheld Kaufmann’s charge that

Treiber should be held for aidingin
the assault because he- verbally
threatened Carney, according to
Livingston’s account of the inci-
dent- . ,

One of the players later conﬁded
that the testimony of Livingston
and Carney given at the hearing
was false. and that eyewitnesses
would counter their story in later
court action._ , 5

Student Aid
Proposed p

BY GREG RINGELING

~ Three major recommendations to

aid graduate students in the School -
of Education, together with the

Administration and advisors, have

been submitted ‘by the Council, of -~

Graduate Students in _Education

(CGSE) to the Dean's Cabinet,

according to CGSE President Greg
LeRoy. ’

The Counsel recommended the
formation of an information and
referal center, an expanded and
more comprehensive course des-
cription catalog and an ongoing
system for program evaluation. -

“We feel these recommenda-"
.tions would benefit everyone

involved in the School of Educa-
tion, from administration to stu-_
dents," LeRoy said. “I think on
the whole the Cabinet realized the
problems involved and was inter-
ested in our plans." .

The information and referral

center is necessary to bridge the

communications gap between the
students and administration, ac-
cording to LeRoy.

\   Pittasa Divided Camp ,

The day is getting nearer when Pitt faculty will hold ballots in their
hands and be-asked to vote yes or no on a union.

That day came a step "closer last week when it was revealed that
Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (PLRB) hearing examiner Sidney
Lawrence had submitted his report to the PLRB on 38 days of faculty
unionization testimony.

The conﬁdential report suggests that the University be divided into
four faculty union sections: the Medical School, the Law School, the
health-related professions and the remaining schools under the
Provost’s Ofﬁce. Each group would have its own bargaining unit.

Though it may be a bit. premature for interested parties to map
strategies concerning the Lawrence report, especially since the PLRB
must decide whether or not to accept it, those involved no doubt

 already have their own opinions on the subject.

Caughtin a Detente Triangle

BY HAROLD BLOOMFIELD

“All set and ready for China,
sir?"

“I guess I’m all set, consider-
ing.”

“Considering what, sir?”

“It’s just that I ordered some
fortune cookies and they didn’t
come in before we left, Henry.”

“I wouldn’t worry about that,
Mr. President." _ —

“Look, it hasn’t been a banner

“Yes, sir, we have detente with
Russia and China both.”

‘‘If we do, how come they’-re
always saying such‘ nasty things
about us and they never vote with

us in the United Nations when we '

need it?_"

“That’s because their systems
dictate that kind oftalk so that their
leaders can do the things they want
without anyone bothering them.
Actually it's not such a bad way to
do business. No Congressional

know what I mean?”

“Now Henry, there's an urgent
matter I want you to take care of."

“What is it. sir?"

“I want you to make sure that
the stairs coming off the plane are
in tip-top condition. I’d like to
make one trip where I don't fall or
have Secret Service men jumping
all over me.”

“l'll have someone see to it.”

want you to forget . who’s boss
around here.”

 

' ’ of The Pitt News.

-concerning the proposed Equal

, “Rights Amendment, was plagued
S 5 with; emotionalism,‘

' based on sex.

Though the report may have taken into consideration faculty and

' ‘administrative power realities, it seems to have neglected the student

situation. We have maintained all along that faculty unionization,

  —  should it come to Pitt, must include students at the bargaining table if
. it is to work to ‘the beneﬁt of education. But with the way student

power on this campus fimctions, a University split into four camps

  would make student input difficult,

if not useless.

Student government at Pitt is not structured along the lines of the
Lawrence report's communities of labor interest. Set up separately for
graduates, undergraduates and night school students, Pitt’s three
systems of student government would not be able to "respond

if  f effectively to the negotiations by one of the faculty units.

A labor dispute involving, say, the Medical School faculty, would
ﬁnd fragmented support among the three student governments, thus '

.~ crippling student inﬂuence and reducing possible student participation «
.. to mere tckenism.

The less centralized the student voice in negotiations, the more futile
is student lobbying in-directing education. -
‘ . The PLRB should take this into consideration when it decides on a

, ﬁnal recommendation.

,        Purpose of ERA    

. I“ am writing in response to the

  , article by Dan Mulholland, “Grim
'and.f.Subtle Motives,”

which
appeared in.the— November 21 issue
The article,

inaccuracies,
and total ignorance of the actual

 '. purpose of the ERA.

Although Mr. Mulholland fails to

' state his perceived aim of the ERA,

he implies that its purpose is to
rent asunder thefabric of American

2 _’ life (i.e. the family). Naturally, this
couldn’t be any .further from the

truth and its based ‘on the illogical
premise that the ERA will cause

" ~. the government to coerce women

into leaving the home for other
fields of endeavor. This has never

’ been the purpose of the ERA,

either explicity or implicity. The

,‘ P ERA simply proposes that both
. men and women be permitted to

pursue any objective with no
regard to invented qualifications
‘Obviously, this
wouldn’t bring havoc to present

 . family relations. It would permit,

however, both men and women to

‘ . choose their place of employment
.-—in or outside the.home. The ERA
- would attempt to erase not only the

restrictions against women, but
also those against men. The

resulting society, with no sexual ,

proscriptions regarding employ-

in . merit would be beneﬁcial to both

men and women. s

‘ Mr. Mulholland displays his
prejudicial employment attitude by
describing secretaries, nurses. and
teachers as feminine positions. He
also implies that these are feminine
because they are “easier” than
male-dominated jobs. Knowing
several nursing students (one of
whom, by the way, is a man) and

  0:132 iattt sﬁrmss

secretaries, I have become aware
that these positions are much more
difficult (and in no way, “femin-
ine”) than the majority of us are
led to believe. Obviously, it will
be ridiculous to term a job either
masculine or feminine after the
ERA’s passage, as this will open all
job opportunities to both sexes.
Mr. Mulholland further displays
his predilection for the forecasting
of our ultimate doom by offering a
litany of catastrophes that would-
befall our nation with the passage
of the ERA. Representative of the
horrendous happenings that would
follow the ERA’s ratification,
according to Mr. Mulholland,
would be the abolishment of
separate rest room facilities. This
is an inane assumption which
shows how far one must reach to
find an argument against the ERA.

It’s a prime example of ‘the V’

absurdities that are fostered by
fanaticism.

I am not so naive asto believe
that the ERA would be a cure-all
for current sexist attitudes. How-
‘ever, I am also aware that it will not
cause the destruction of our.
society. At best, the ERA will
result in institutional changes that
will bring about attitudinal changes
concerning current roles. If
prescribed role-playing, is inhibit-
ing (and it is), then the destruction
of these proscriptions will allow for
greater personal development for
both men and women. At the least,
the ERA will be a statement by a
free people that they endorse
individual freedom for all.
Certainly the creation of a society
where one is first and foremost a
person is a worthwhile objective for
a nation of free peoples.

Catalogs of Christmas Joy  

A BY JOHN METCALFE

The Christmas season is upon us. Actually, there
are many Christmas seasons, and they occupy

slightly different parts of the calendar year. For

instance, we all know Halloween cannot be far away
when the lights and decorations begin to appear on
the streets of our communities.

Newspapers begin to grow heavier as ‘early as the

I middle of September, swelling to a ‘great peak toward '

the end of November. At that time last year, the
Sunday editionof the New York Times, as delivered
in Pittsburgh, shorn of its classified advertisement
sections, weighed ﬁve.pounds, 14‘ounces on :2
reputable scale. — '

This development ends abruptly. By the second

week of December, the Times is reduced to the size

and heft of a local afternoon newspaper. The
difference is in the advertising. Mail-order

. advertising aimed at Christmas shoppers must end

well in advance of the season for, let us say, ads
intended to lure shoppers into local shops and
boutiques. ‘ i . .

The mail-order advertisers are in their hour of
glory at this time of the year. Even those who cannot
afford to buy many of their offerings can get some
harmless and welcome amusement from the attempts
being made upon‘ their purses. If you ever purchase
anything by mail—even a magazine subscription-
you can expect to get catalogs. If you have bought
other things by mail, you will be showeredwith
catalogs, brochures and folders. At first they will
arrive singly, then in pairs. They will come in
bunches and then in dozens. They will arrive by the
score, by the hundred, by the gross. You will own
enough glossy paper to redecorate _a barn.

But glossy paper is heavy, and does not burn
satisfactorily in the ﬁreplace. You need not buy
anything by mail, and you need not become
dependent on catalogs. You need only read a copy of
one of those publications that imagine their readers
to be not only intelligent,,but also rich. Take the New
Yorker. I do. ' '

_"My favorite mad extravagance of this giving
season was advertised in a recent issue. It is offered
by a deliberately snobbish store in far-off Texas.

For them it is a modest offering. It costs less than

$100. I am surprised they do not quote a price for lots
of a dozen, or more. It is called a “Calcu-pen."
' It is described in large type as “Literally, a pen you
really can count on...” Both the curious prose and
the string of dots belong to the advertiser; l
reproduce them only.for your entertainment.

What can the thing be? It costs $80 plus tax, and
$1.35 for mailing. It looks like part of a kit for people

' who want to build their own computers. It is a slender

'-.Vn4. §¢’1A.ro< -cu... -. .n...a..-..4»..«~... ~....:.n 4-I---I. 4.. ~~.a..

' cylinder about six inches long. One side is flat. It is
. decorated with four numbered buttons and a piece of -I

digital display material.‘ It has a.pocket clip. There is _-
-a button at one end; the other’ end is conical and
_'hollow. It looks like a fat, clumsy ball-point pen.’ '

<.ua...........,._..»._..........:.. ,..- ,.,.._-._.o. .._. .V..._. - .. . . 9.. - -_-. - - - - - -- V-’--.

It is. It is also a four-function calculator. As far as I
can see, each of the control buttons is capable el‘
moving in a north-south, east-west direction, thus
giving the user a chance to operate with all 10 of the
digits of common arithmetic, as well as to direct the
thing to perform basic calculations. It is an awesome
_object.

' Whether you choose to worry about thedifﬁculties.
of writing with such a substantial implement. or ilu
near impossibility of entering problems into till.‘
intricate keyboard and reading results on the niir‘iui«
readout, it will give you pause. p
C There are other questions. The long and . noisy
debate on ‘calcu1ators—whethe'r they should he
allowed, at all, whether the prosperous should have
them when the poor do not, whether they should be
permitted in examinations—has- wound down. Most
instructors have said either yes or no; those who have
‘said both have specified where the use of tl’IC.\<.'
inferi_ial_ machines is licit. And now we have this.

This IS the ﬁrst surreptitious calculator, and the
very knowledge that such a thing exists thus far has
been restriced to the well-read and presunizibly
well-off. This is an outrage.

I would recommend that until the matter of lhe.~.t-
surreptitious calculators is resolved, and especiall y ll
the season of Final Examinations (just before
Christmas), you all take care not to ﬁddle and play
too much with your pens, however innocent and
cheap they may be. ‘

ADDENDUM. I have just found more to report. An
advertisement in the New York Times announced thi-
availability at $800 a copy, of wrist watches that are
also calculators.- The operating buttons are disguised
as markers for the traditional 12 numerals of the
clock faee. I am at a loss. All I can suggest is. when ll‘.

exams, do not consult your watch either. Indeed, do

not wear it that day. Your professors will be glad to
tell you what time it is, and how much time remains
of the examination period. They will admire you for

preserving not only honesty, but also the appearance

of honesty.

Letter to the editor

p A Capitalism in Its Final Crisis  

.1.‘-I ,

Over the weeks ahead, the
National Caucus of Labor Commit-
tees and the U.S. Labor Party will
be rooting out the networks of
agents infesting the U.S. and
European Left, and the ideology of
anarcho-syndicalism they propa-
gate. 4

This task is urgently necessary
and especially possible given
current political circumstances.

- As the Rockefeller-centered Dol-
lar Empire faces its greatest threat
in history from the emerging
pro-development alliance of ‘Come-
con, Third World and anti-“Atlan-
L..-/’”ticist” capitalist forces, the Rocke- '
feller-CIA forces are frantically
activating every arm of the
police state and counterinsurgency
apparatus they have spawned since
World War II to regainlost political
ground. This has the "unintended
but useful consequence of remov-
A ing the “covert” nature of such
operations, allowing us to identify
the organizations and factions that

have been created by the Invisible '

Government as “countergangs,"
as per British Brigadier Kitson‘s4
study of 1960.

As‘ the current “Webs of
-.,.,-yvlntelligence" series in the USLP’s

“lzes. - New Solidarity documents, capital-

ist strategists have inﬁltrated and ‘
seized effective control of so,cial_ist.
organizations since (at least)__ the-
British Round Table think-tankers
penetrated the.Second Internation-
al via the Fabian Society/ Bernstein
operation. Their end products can
be. seen today in the "State

‘ Department Socialism" of the’

, European social democracies‘ and
‘the’ _AFL-CIO« and UAW‘ leader-
ships.

'l'oday, major elements of certain
Communist parties andthe bulk of
 the Trptskyist “FourthrInternation-
 of Ernest Mandel—not to
. mention various pro-NATO Maoist
sectlets—are under the ﬁnger-tip
control of the National Security
Council, the’RAND Corporation,
and their ﬁnancier-strategist over-
seers. Exemplary of this operation

is the’ way key U.S. agents in
Western Europe, notably Swedish
Premier Olaf Palme and the Brandt
faction of the SPD, have moved
against the European Labor Com-
mittees (US_LP affiIiate_s) and
sought to sever the ELC's influence

over Cl’ and_SoclaIist factions
through slander (incredibly, using
the line that the "ELC is ClA!")
and outright purges. Angela
Davis, a brainchild of OSS-CIA
operative Herbert Marcuse, was
programmed with this line on a
recent Swedish tour and has been
dispensing it onjherrecent national
tour. ‘

Speaking in Pittsburgh two
weeks ago, Davis admitted that the
one policy on which the CP and
SWP are agreed is “the need to
stop the U.S. Labor Party.” On
that score, not coincidentally, they -
are joined by the American Nazi
Party and the United Klans of
America, two agent-riddled groups
which have recently announced the
USLP to be their principal enemy,
and by the Justice Department,
which has just declared the Labor
Party liable to the provisions of the

cCarran Act.

Davis, who has otherwise occu-

I pied herself defending the NSC-

created SLA and trapping sections
of the CP into the,FBI's classic
“anti-repression” ruse, might
have added that the two organiza-
tions concur on their support for
the government’s race-riot scenario
via the “school busing” and

‘_‘‘-Affirmative Action” hoaxes and

their shared belief that socialist
transformations are 10 or 20 years.
off. At a time when we face the
global question of nuclear or
economic holocaust or of working- .-
elass governments within two-to- V
three years, the working class can
ill afford the sabotage of'these»
agents. ’

The crucial point _to grasp,'.
however, is that while- speciﬁc
investigation can pinpoint pivotal
connections of‘ the intelligence
community to’ the left, only an.
understanding of the sociology of
capitalist counterinsurgency can
deﬁnitively lay bare the CIA modus
operandi: seeking to defuse bur-
geoning pro-socialist political fer-
ment in the population, implicitly
anti-socialist "local-control" or

- led environment

“interest-group" organizing--

activity which accepts the control-
of depression-
wracked capitalism and the bour-
gcois identity—is actively promo-
ted by capitalist agencies to
frustrate socialist organization.

The extreme form of this anarcho-

syndiealist method can be seen in ‘

the constellation of "liberation
movements" supported by the
SWP: black nationalism, Chicano
na_tionaIism, women's“ “national-
ism," homosexual “nationalism,”
etc., etc. As, every leading

Rockefeller think-tank—-unlike the-

naive dupes ,of their agents in the
left——understands, these pluralist

forms of consciousness and social ~

institutions are not only antithetical
to a Marxi-an worldview, but,
practically speaking, have’ been
and remain the basis of fascism as
a popular movement.

In the 1919-20 period, as nearly
successful working-class upsurges
swept Europe, capitalist agents in
the anarchio-syndicalist “ultra-
left" of. Europe formed the
"Amsterdam International" to
counter the Soviet-led A communist
_movemcnt. Today, when ‘capital-
lsnt is entering its ﬁnal crisis and
the stakes are “for keeps," the
U.S. Labor Pa_rty intends to see that

no such treachery against‘ the V

socialist movement is committed
again. 1'

Wednesday, December 3,'19‘75—THE PITT

Letter

A recent series of articles which
appeared on WTAE-TV, entitled
“Who’s Minding Our Children,”
contained the worst piece of
slanted TV broadcasting that we
have ever seen. The particular
article in question appeared [nurs-
day. November 6.

This part of the series on
child-care ‘and day-care centers
purported to show what the worst
day-care centers were like. The‘
broadcast showed children running
and playing in what was described
as overcrowded conditions by
Donna Deaner, who is chieﬂy
responsible for the series. She

described the scene as loud and
unorganized. She turther stated

that the children had to climb
“dangerous" stairs to get to the
bathroom, and .other health ha-
zards were noted. One of the
scenes showed a little girl who was
“playing" with matches. Further
comments were made about the
lack of outside recreational facili-
ties. .

What Deaner did not tell the
viewing audience was that the
scenes were taken from a Hallo-

. ween party the nursery school had,

in order that the children and
parents might be spared some of
the hazards of trick-or-‘treating at
night! I

She did not mention that there
are almost never that many
children in the school at one time
because part-time students’ were
also at the party!
loud and unorganized since not
many two- to six-year-olds' can
control themselves at.a party where
the main idea is to act and sound as
much like a ghost or monster,as
possible. If Deaner would have
taken the time or made the effort,
she would know that these same
children have a period every day
where they all sit‘ down, rather
quietly, and sing songs, _say their.
‘ABCs, and perform simple training
exercises such as matching objects,
etc.

The comment about “danger-
ous" stairs was ridiculous. Are all
stairs dangerous? Are these more
dangerous than others? Do,

This is the third article examin-
ing the feasibility of holding the
1984 World’s Fair in Pittsburgh.
Though the series was originally in
three parts, the topic merits further

1 treatment and will include one

«more segment.

In the world of 1984, even more
than today, the key to attracting
patrons ‘to a world’s fair in
Pittsburgh will be convenience, the
ease with which visitors can reach
the fair site after they arrive in
Pittsburgh.

If Pittsburgh tries to rely on'the
network of roads and parkways now
in existence, a Pittsburgh fair will
be ‘ doomed to failure before it
opens. " Early visitors caught in

rush-hour trafﬁc will discourage

neighbors from making the ar-

vduous trip to see the Pittsburgh

fair, and attendance will fall far

might be expected to attend such
an event.

But in Pittsburgh’s case, it is not
easy to suggest a remedy for
outmoded highways. - A transit
system to serve a fair should be
expected to" serve the resident
population long after the fair has
closed, particularly considering the
money necessary to build modern
rapid-transit systems.

Pittsburgh does have the Port
Authority Transit (PAT) bus
system. But it is not up to the task
of hauling millions of passengers
through city streets to a world's fair
site. One problem is that the buses
now in use are barely adequate to
handle normal PAT ridership.
More buses would, have to be
purchased to move World’s Fair
visitors, taxing the city_’s streets
even further—though not as badly
as relying on automobiles to move
the crowds—adding another bur-
den to PAT operations that already

Could Be a Long-Term Benefit

In addition to the inherent
inadequacy of any current bus
system, visitors to a world’s fair
expect to see the unusual, such as
the Monorail at the New York Fair
in 1964-65.

If the PAT bus
insufficient to handle a world’s— fair
crowd, it might be possible to adapt
one of the more innovative transit
systems now being tested in
various cities. Even those systems
have serious drawbacks, however.

In Morgantown, W. Va., West
Virginia University and the federal
government have teamed up to
produce a relatively novel transit
system called Personal Rapid
Transit.

BY MARY ANNE GORSKI

Have you ever wondered what
there is to do on campus besides
hang around the Student Union
deciding what classes to cut?

If you're looking for "something
different to do after class, look up
the Pitt chapter of the YMCA. It
doesn’t have a gym or a swimming
pool, but it can accommodate
almost anyone—anyone with a
desire to help someone else, that
is.

The Pitt YMCA was organized 70
years ago primarily .to serve
student needs. Gradually it

 " nsformed into a student organi-
~f}:‘ition that helps the community.

_ Volunteers children in the Pitt YMCAS nto-One Pr0j‘tcsa

In the past, the YMCA has been

student coordinators, projects such
as Link (YMCA “clubs for 8- to
12-year-olds) and JVA (Juvenile
Volunteers in Action, a one-on-one
situation in which students are big
brothers and sisters to juveniles on
probation) have been run through
the Y.

On September 1, however, the
Pitt YMCA added to its scope
responsibility for the entire Oak-
land area. This new function of the
Y will not end its work as a student

. group, but will add more commun-

ity participation, according to
YMCA Director Tom Huff.

seconds before the next car. The
cars are demand-regulated, which
means they respond to passenger
load as indicated by turnstile
receipts. They are neat, almost-
futuristic in appearance, and

located conveniently enough to ‘
_,,§erve Morgantown’s student popu-
.5h>£iti0n. ‘

V The drawback is that the system,

originally slated to cost $18 million,

and provide six terminals, recently
was put into trial operation, with
only three stations, at a final cost of
about $60 million. After a series of

. legal battles, the government has

agreed to construct three more
stations at a cost of $53.8 million.‘

Meanwhile in California, the San
Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART) system has been‘ in
operation for three years and has
been a dismal financial failure.

1969 at a cost of $790 million,

with maintenance problems, and

the system, designed to employ.

1,200 people and to handle about
200,000 riders a day, now employs
more than 2,000 workers and is
hauling only 125,000 passengers a
day.

This year, it will cost about $67
million to operate BART, but fares
will bring in only‘$22 million.

But, amid all the gloom and lost
greenbacks, there is a bright spot.
Both, the Morgantown and the
BART systems do move passen-
gers. In BART’s case,_the failure
to handle the optimum" number of
passengers probably is affected by
the availability of freeway systems.

The answer to Pittsburgh’s Fair
problem, then, might be to develop
a mass transit system that is

inexpensive to construct and.

between the University and the
community," he said. “This new
involvement with the Oakland
citizens will give students the.
opportunity to get involved on
many levels." He added that,
where it is feasible, students will
lead the new “comr_nunity" pro-
jects, in addition to leading the
ongoing programs.

In order to ﬁnd out what the
Oakland community has to offer
students, what is needed and how

student volunteers can help,.

Project Outreach, headed by Ann
Altmyer, has been instituted at the
Y .

“Oakland is a segmented com-
munity,” Huff said. “This is a
chance for students who want to
get to know the people—to talk, to
experience the area.”

Project Outreach has been

involved with such, things as
organizing petitions and ‘handing
out leaﬂets in cooperation with the
People's Oakland group, to inform
citizens of the city’s plans to
expand the Boulevard of the Allies.
The proposed changes (which were
passed in the City budget two years
ago but released only six weeks
ago) would be “devastating” to the
already fragmented community,
the group feels. Student volunteers

for Fair  

passenger demand without diffi-
culty, and will be able to serve
Pittsburgh’s needs long after the
fair has struck its tents and left
town. ‘ ,

The BART and Morgantown
experiences have shown that mass
transit is possible, despite cost
overruns. Pittsburgh, indeed, has
debated the idea of rapid transit for
years. In fact, the ill-fated Skybus
project was similar to the Morgan-
town experiment but on a larger

‘scale.

There is little question that a fair
could be constructive and instruc-
tive, both for Pittsburgh and for the
world. But if Pittsburghers really
want a world’s fair, it’s high time to
start working toward 1984.

NEXT?‘ What mass transit can.

"on-the-job experience,

professions sponsored by

have seen the people in their
homes as they really are-they’ve
learned, Huff said.

The- community groups have
received the “new" YMCA with
‘.‘open arms," according to Huff..

_The-services of the YMCA are

known, and the student volunteers
are trusted. If there is a gap in trust V
between the University and the
area, Huff feels that this new
funciton of the organization will

- help to close it. ,
Although the YMCA, funded by ‘

United Way, is aimed primarily at
students helping others, the
experience is beneficial to the.
participant in more than one way.

-In addition to the “gratiﬁcaton”

aspect of helping others, the
concrete job experience helps the
‘volunteer as mhch as cla'ss_room
activities. *

Projects like Med-X, in which
preprofessional health students_
volunteer at least six _hours
weekly, allow qualifying students a
chance to learn in actual hospitals
and clinics. In addition _to
students
lectures on the health
local

attend

hospitals, learn “non-volunteer”
procedureslike taking blood, and
have access to medical‘ libraries at .
pzgtjcipating hospitals.

Other projects at the Y include

work with cerebral palsy victims, ' '8

mentally jretarded children and
adults, preschoolers, school age

children, veterans and senior  _;
citizens. According to Huff, these -I 3
programs otter a unique opportu-j

nity for students to (ﬁnd out
theﬁelds they are studying. I

Huff is enthusiastic about the Y’s '

400 volunteers this term (more than
1,000 for the whole year), and that
some students have gotten per-
manent jobs directly because of
volunteer experience.

In addition to more than 20.8

volunteer programs, the ‘Y offers
informal classes on subjectslike
yoga and transactional analysis,
and periodically sponsors flea
market sales in the Student_Union.

The YMCA staff here at Pitt

consists of Huff, Altmyer, four-

work-study students, a, part-time

reading specialist and 30 volunteer 0

project coordinators. The coordin-

ators are supervised by a leader- .

ship team of ﬁve other students. ,

The newest member of the  8
“team” is Chi-Lean Vuong, its‘. '—
who is »a Vietnamese‘

secretary,
refugee. YMCA staffers met her
while working on their summer

project to aid refugees at Indian- V

_ “weird”

'. crowds are hostile,

4

BY STEVE SYBERT

~ It’s something they can tell their
kids someday; _

It's a way of playing the fool

when no one knows who they are.

. For Don Nixon and all the guys’

who preceded him, its being the

— Pitt Panther. But it can be even

more than drawing enthusiasm by

‘ dressing up as the school's mascot. .

It can be fun.

‘\ “Everybody gets in goofy moods

and likes to be a total jerk once in a

A while,” Nixon said. “But they hold

back forfear of being seen. I don’t
have to holdback at anything. I can
act weird and still look -good.” '

Anyone who’s been to a Pitt"

football game has seen just how
Nixon can get. His
performance ranges from stealing

"—cheerl'eaders and ﬁghting mascots

of the opposing teams to doing
pushups (240 at the Army game),
back-ﬂips and all sorts of funny
antics when the Panthers score.’
Against William and Mary,

r Nixon stole a cheerleader and ran a

220-yard dash with the surprised
girl on his back. But against West

, Virginia, he did not quite get away.

“The Mountaineer (West Virgin:
ia’s mascot) came after me when I
tried to grab a WVU cheerleader
and hit me blind," he said. “We
both fell to the turf and wrestled for
a while. I think I beat him.”

Being attacked by fellow m_2_1_§gg’g§
is only one peril a Pitt Panther
must face. He takes a big chance by
daring to walk through the stands.

“One time, the guys from FIJI
grabbed me, passed me around,

r then dropped me,” Nixon said. “I

landed on top of a girl, but she was
nice about the whole thing.”

If the Panthers thinks the Pitt
what about
those "of Pitt’s adversaries? Only a
half-crazy person would face an
excited ‘mob like. the one at West
Virginia this year. Nixon, however,
had no choice.

“I was standing right under the
goal post when WVU’s winning
ﬁeld goal was kicked,” he said. “I
had ‘to get off the ﬁeld or I would
have been mobbed. I shot for the
‘tunnel as fast as I could, but (still

two guys came after me and were
saying, ‘Let’s get his tail.’ I shoved
one away and a cop grabbed the
other while.I headed forrthe locker
room.” _

The 6-0, 185-pound Nixon is
perfectly capable of protecting
himself from souvenir hunters. His
size also comes-in handy when h
must lift a cheerleader. ~

It was Nixon’s background in
gymnastics, however, that made
his tryout for the mascot position
successful. After winning letters at
Peters Township High School,
known for its excellent gymnastics
program, Nixon, now a senior
biology major, continued in the
sport at Pitt and lettered during his
junior year.

At the request of cheerleading
co-captain Linda Armbruster, gym-
nastics coach Ig Perez talked to
Nixon about trying out to be the
Panther.

“It consisted of gymnastics,~
pushups and an interview on how I
would createenthusiasm and the
steps I would use.” /

A pleasant personality may not
have" been a qualiﬁcation, but
Nixon has one nonetheless. When
he clowns on the ﬁeld, he isn’t
hiding behind a mask. He’s just
being himself.

“I have heard comments like, ‘If
you ever need cheering up, go talk

to Don for awhile,”_’ he said. “I’m _
"hardly ever depressed and that

helps‘ me. It’s hard to keep the
enthusiasm going when you’re
down.”

Nixon can relate many amusing
experiences that have stemmed
from his Panther role. At Temple,
for instance, he learned what
happens to a curious cat.

The. night before the Syracuse
game was Halloween, so Nixon and
several cheerleaders dressed up.
The Panther outﬁt was a purr-fect

Nixon said, “and when I saw a leg

Nixon, who must appear at

Artists in action’
'   Fair Reveals Art Mysteries

BY MREA CSORBA

If you’ve never been part of a
breathless crowd, fascinated by the
skillful control of a potter, or
amazed by the recognizable out-
come of an artist's seemingly
haphazard use of paint, the YMCA
Crafts Fair gives you the chance.

At the Crafts Fair that will be in
the Lower Lobby of the Student
Union Friday and Saturday, you
will be able to explore the hidden
secrets and appreciate the de-
mands of artists in action.

Though music is not included in
the bill of fare, you may be drawn
to the Fair by the mellow sound of
wooden ﬂutes. The music man
will be Tom Ohestrom,- who
fashions hand-made ﬂutes from
bamboo and sunflower stalks.

Tom air-dries the fall harvest of
sunﬂower stalks then strips away
the outer covering to work with
the porous matter underneath. It is
from this inner fiber that he carves
the ﬂutes, shellacking them to
make the air column tight.

Visually his ﬂutes invited hand-
ling and playing. Their sound is
rich and sensual.

For the musician, the added
dimension gained from having a
hand-crafted instrument is mea-
sureless. That’s how Carroll Abbott
and Bob Hutchinson got started

Page -10-IEE-F13?-.NElV$:W¢<1.e9sda¥».Peamlzer 3..I.2zs., .

"making dulcimers. The dulcimer,

an Appalachian variant on the
mandolin, is the basis of the
blue-grass sound. Hoping to revive
this nearly forgotten music, Abbott:
and Hutchinson will be at the Fair
to strum up interest.

The two friends have set up
shop, cutting out the dulcimer
pieces and boiling and soaking the
wood into the proper shape.

“Blue-grass music is big on the
West Coast, though it has its roots
in Appalachia,” Hutchinson said.

If you like functional wood art,
you can enjoy wooden plaques from
Margaret and John Erario’s work-

shop. During the Fair, they will‘

make up signs or plaques on
request. ~

Passing on to Joanne Staros-
chak’s table, you will meet
Pittsburgh's famous egg-painting
lady. Staroschak’s Ukranian back-
ground is reﬂected in her colorful
decoration of dyed chicken, geese
and ostrich eggs. In keeping with
old-country traditions, she tries to
use only natural dyes.

Batik, the art of pattern-dyeing
on a larger scale, will ‘be
demonstrated by Alice Hassibi.
With water boiling in her electric
frying pan, and cloth wax and color
close by, she promises to dye up a
storm.

Bad  
Sneakers

BY DOUG GEBHARD

What is the purpose of college programming? And to what degree
is it to be an alternative to “city entertainment"? I suspect that at Pitt
we have‘ different answers to these questions than they have at
Edinboro or any such smaller school, but the primary function, it seems
to me, is still to provide something in the vague area of an “educational
experience."

 

I am a member of Pitt Programming and am quite close with the

committee leaders. I have had many discussions concerning this
committee and one thing sticks out from all the comments—this
committee is not anentertainment or promotional group. If it fulﬁls
people's expectations, there is a thought schism that until now has
been undeﬁned. '

It never has been made clear that Programming never has brought
and never will bring in “top" artists. The simple reason is that these
acts are priced outrageously above the financial capabilities of such an
organization. There is an even better reason for not always booking
these big ‘names, and that is talent. One certainly must concede that a
big name means nothing now, just because his recognition came from
selling records. Even Tony Orlando and Dawn _,sell records. _

To be able to bring into this school people like Dave Van Ronk,
Norman Blake or Tom Waits for a mere pittance is a luxury one can't
pass by. There are many musicians who lay small clubs and who don’t
receive the fame or glory the hot ones do. But in this city, let Pacific
and Engler waste their fortunes on Doodley Squat while Pitt
Programming books solid talent and gives it to you for pennies.

Let me point to a classic example. Coming on December 8 will be
Steve Goodman (writer of “City of New Orleans”) and the greatest
ﬁddle player alive, Vassar ‘Clements. -This show will be in Carnegie
Music Hall, and for one buck, no less. I mean really! Even if you don’t

« know who these people are, shouldn’t you spend a little money and find

out? Or is there something in the wind and vogue called “conspicuous
consumption"? Forget Zelda's, for God’s sake, and experience
something new.

lt’s disappointing to see my generation fall back on the vices created
by our elders. This laziness and apathy of a nonadventurous
generation seems sad...no, pitiful. If you can't try something a little
different, why try anything at all? »

patients as other than breeding
plants for germs?

In The Cure, an October release
fromi Dial Press, Paul- Ferris
presents these questions and tries
to find an answer. The answer is
not bIack—and-white, he says.

In any case, it was not the cure
that was important; it was the
attitudes of the discoverer and of
the large drug companies with the
funds to provide research facilities
for refinement of the wonder drug.
It was the attitude of the doctors

who had the first opportunity to‘

administer the new drug to a

, terminal cancer patient, a fictional

secretary in the federal govern-
ment. Most of all, it was the
attitude of those who needed the
new drug to.prolong life.

  ‘Grand Papa’
Of Pops Huge

5” lHif in Pgh.

' BY TOM WASELESKI

Stepping along the aisle that cuts
through the musicians, the white-
haired, mustachioed conductor
greets his players and audience
with twinkling eyes that have made
him the Grand Papa of all
conductors. _ V

And so Arthur Fiedler, who is
more at home with the Boston
Pops. took the baton before the
Pittsburgh Symphony last weekend

 kick off the orchestra’s once-'
4 again sold out Pops Series.

After shaking the hand of the
concertmaster, Fiedler hopped
briskly onto the red-carpeted
platform and, with but a second’s
‘pause, brought his stick down on
the first beat. ' '

After opening with the Overture
to Euryanthe by Weber, a
relatively low-key piece, Fiedler
lined up his classical selections
before the intermission. Although
performed with pastoral smooth-
ness, the overture was in retrospect
the evening’s most boring event.

More lively was Tchaikovsky’s
Piano Concerto No. 1, featuring
pianist Ilana Vered, whose playing

, was ‘iridre 'dE1'ziI’ii1'g' ‘than ' her"“
sequined rose gown. -

The first movement started‘ off
simply enough, but the pop
audience’s attention appeared to
wane when the melody became
harder to follow and the interplay
of various‘ orchestral sections with
the piano increased. .

Interest picked up during the
second movement as the mode was
repeated more often, and the music
emanating from Vered’s ﬁngers on
the keys was particularly soothing
when backed solely by violas.

The ﬁnal movement was the

"most colorful, with Vered awaken-

ing the last few somnambulists
with a powerful beating inﬂicted on
the ivory board. Despite several
violins that were noticeably out of
sync during the-concerto’s close,

‘ Vered’s performance was memor-

able. '

Having already cast ‘hisey line,
Fiedler tossed in some bait after
the intermission, this time hook-
free, leading off with the immedi-
ately familiar Tales from the
Vienna Woods by Johann Strauss,
Jr. The audience derived comfort
from the popular. Viennese waltzes,
although the arrangement ended
too curtly. I

A rollicking Gershwin-Anderson
medley followed with “I Got
Rhythm,” “Embraceable You,”
“Bidin’ My Time” and “But Not
for Me.” There was much fanfare
in the se1ection’s opening, as
Fiedler captured the big-band,
big-movie sound so necessary for

“They’ve Killed The President!”
by Robert Sam Anson, Bantam
Books, 408 pages, paper, $2.50.

Once in a while, a new book
comes along that should be read by
everyone. They’ve Killed‘ The
President! is one of those rare
books.

Robert Sam Anson is not merely
rehashing the events of the
Kennedy Assassination of Novem-
ber 22, 1963. He is bringing to
light new facts, or at least old facts
in a new way. He is making the
events surrounding the assassina-
tion appear in a new light,

What actually happened ‘ in
Dallas that day? Did Lee Harvey
Oswald, acting alone, shoot -John
F. Kennedy‘? Was there only one
riﬂe? Was there a "magic bullet”
that could make 90-degree turns in
mid-air? .

Anson says no. He presents the‘

available information to his,readers/
‘as if they were. guests at a

smorgasbord: a little of this and a
little of that, and dish by dish,
chapter by chapter, the guests find
they have eaten more than they
'should. '

information that was available to
the Warren Commission. True, the
intervening 12 years have shed
some faint light on that day in
Dallas, but largely, Anson’s tale is
what could have been told by the
Warren Commission.

Unfortunately, if Anson is
correct in his statements, ‘the

fact, that Lee Harvey Oswald was
even involved in the killing.
The Warren‘ Commission, either

by accident or intent, served to .

obliterate whatever traces may
have been found of the real
conspirators.

either ignored or stretched to fit the « ,
single-assassin theory, and in the. - .

process, the truth of the Dallas
nightmare may have been lost '
irretrievably. ‘ , w :-

lmagine an order of 22,000 priests and brothers in 73
countries around the world. (That's a pretty big family.)

But that's what the Salesians of St. John Bosco are all
about — a large family of community-minded men dedicated
to the service of youth. (And no one gets lost.)

In the 1800's a chance meeting between a poor
priest and a street urchin served to create a movement of such
success that it is still growing today. Don Bosco became the
priest who brought youth back from the streets — and

back to God.

He reasoned that a program of play, learn and pray would
make useful citizens of the world. He crowded outevil with
reason, religion and kindness in a (what was then unheard of)

atmosphere of family spirit.

The ideals of St. John Bosco are still with us today. His
work goes on in boys clubs, technical and academic schools,
guidance centers, summer_camps and missions. And his very
human approach is very evident in the family spirit of the
Salesians. This isthe way he wanted -it. This is the way it is.

The Salesian experience isn’t learned — it’s lived.

' The best of the night was, -of all

verse. Snappy drums and ﬂashy
cymbals also helped make the

march rousing.
Fiedler, who dedicated much of

his life’s work to the popularization
of classical music, is a pro at luring
both young and old into the world
of the symphony by treating them
to hit tunes wrapped in classical
garb. At Heinz Hall, Fiedler was no
different, giving Pittsburghers not
only what they want, but also what
they need. V

-You win some and you lose
some. Unfortunately for -the Pan-
thers, and perhaps for college
basketball, you tend to lose more
on the road. '

The Panthers received a rude
awakening last night at the falls in
upper New York, in the form of 34
personal fouls. as thev were
drubbedby Niagara, 78-69. The
home team, by the way, collected a
total of 16 fouls.

' Perhaps it would be unfair to
blame the Cats’ loss on the fouls.
You couldn’t blame it on a lack of
hustle, the opposition’s extreme
height‘ advantage or. the hot

shooting of Andy Walker, Nia-A

gara’s 6-4 guard who poured in 24
points. I

The Panthers played aggressive
defense and fought for their lives
under the boards in a game more
closely contested than the score
might indicate.

The fine shooting . of Larry.
Harris, who had 25 points, and
.Tom Richards, with 13, ‘combined
with the sterling. defense play of
Willie Kelly and Ralph McClelland,
kept the, game close most of the
Way-' .

Most of the way, that is, until the
fouls. began to catch up with the
Panthers. »

The game was a battle for both
teams in the ﬁrst half, with Niagara
slowly creeping away with the lead,
and the Panthers struggling back to

within’ six pointsat the half. Harris

hit a juniper with less than two\

seconds to go, and Pitt trailed,

41-35.
In that casualty-ridden first half,

Terry Knight picked up four fouls, ~-

three of which came in the ﬁrst two
minutes. Pitt had a total of 18
first-"half fouls. '

The second half started off much
the same way, with Niagara
inching off into the horizon. .

Trailing 48-41, ‘ the Panthers
started to go to work offensively.
Harris hit a foul shot and a jumper.
Richards, Scott Nedrow and Knight.
added baskets, and freshman
Wayne Williams added four points.
Outscoring Niagara 13-4, the

_ Panthers found themselves on top, _
54-52."

Suddenly, the party was over.
Knight picked up his ﬁfth foul with
11:40 to go in the game. Kelly left
not Iran a minute _ later. Harris,
McClelland and Williams had to
play conservatively with ‘four fouls
each, as did Richards and Frank
Boyd.

It was in the next four. to
ﬁve-minute span that Niagara
rattled off 17 unanswered points
totake a commanding 69-54 lead.
Pitt countered with eight of its own

8 to close the gap to seven, but that

was as close as the game Cats could
come. They eventually lost Rich-
ards and Boyd to the foul-nian.
From the charity stripe. Niagara
hit’ 28 of 35, while the Panthers hit’
nine of 15. That_’s a tough-19 points
to make up, especially with the

sudden losses of Knight, Kelly, .

Richards and Boyd.

“Temple, Villanova Fall I 

BY YAIER LEHRER

It would seem the Pitt swim team
deserves a new name, something
that characterizes its_talent, depth
and toughness. After the demoli-
tion of Temple, 74-35, and of
Villanova, 85-28, last weekend, the
only name that comes to mind is
“The Wrecking Crew,”

The rest of the Eastern swim

"teams had better beware of the

Wrecking Crew. Against Villanova,
the Crew won 10 of 13 events,
ﬁnishing ﬁrst and second in seven
of 11 individual events. Against
Temple, it set six new Temple pool
records. ~ _

After the swimmers had de-
voured a big Thanksgiving dinner
at the DeMuro'househofd,'i't was
only ﬁtting that Jerry DeMuro
would lead the team at Villanova on
Friday, setting a pool record in the
1,000-yard free-style, an event in
which he has already qualified for
the Olympic trials. He also
obtained first place in the 200-yard
butterfly and the 500-yard free-
style. -

He also obtained first places in- the
200-yard butt-er‘fly—and the-500-yard
freeestyle.

Not to be outdone, Carlos
Santiago set the pool record in the
200-yard backstroke against _Villa-
nova and then came right back
Saturday to . set a record at
Temple's pool. , V _ _

“This is the strongest beginning
we’ve had since I’ve been here,”
Coach Dick Bradshaw said. “The
swimmers‘ ‘times are excellent for
being so early inithe seasoiif’

And the swimmers are not the
only ones off to a good start. Pitt’s
diving team, which Coach Al

Coffey feels is the best in the East,

took first and second in every event
it entered. Jeff Miller and Dave
Reeder -supplying the» one-two

punch—-Miller picking% up 1 first, .
place while..Reeder took second. * * ’

    

(For those of you who don’t
know: the swimmers and the
divers compete together.)

Reeder _and Miller qualiﬁed for
the NCAAs‘ and Tom Fatyol
missed it by a mere two points, but
he still has a'full season to get
those points.

“We could have taken any two

. divers from this squad and taken

ﬁrst and second in every event,”
Coffey said. “Dan Kelly, a
freshman and last year’s Texas
state champ, is a real good one.
With all the talent we have, there is
no doubt that Pitt will have an
all-American diver by I977.’’

The divers ain’t doin’ so bad in
1975, either.

“Their consistency rating is 30%
better than last year,” Coffey said.-

—“There’s just no comparison

between this and,anv other team
we’ve had since I’ve been here.”

One of the reasons for the
tremendous improvement in diving
and swimming is the great depth
on the Pitt swim team. ‘

“We are four and ﬁve deep in

some events and don’t lose much
by putting in the ﬁfth man,”
Bradshaw said. “Freshman Mike
Nelson could have broken the pool
breaststroke record two years ago.
«Orlando Catinchi
Clemmer are'also excellent fresh-
man breaststroker_s.”

Clemmer took ﬁrst place in the
200-yard breaststroke against
Temple and picked up a ﬁrst place
in the 1,000-yard free-style, giving
DeMuro a rest. Catinchi set pool
records at Temple and Villanova in
the breaststroke.

Another freshman who has given
the Wrecking Crew some added
depth is Bobby Greenwald. Green-
wald shocked a lot of people when
he passed last year’s second-place
ﬁnisher in the Easterns ' in the
1,000-yard event, and he also took"
a second in the 200-yard free-style.

Swimming for .ex«peri‘e'nce,‘‘he -

managed dtoepick , up athird ‘place in

and Robert ~

 ﬁnals, ’

  

the 500-yard free-style.

The list goes on and on. In his‘.

years as coach of the Pitt swim
team, Bradshaw has managed to
build‘ a winning swim program and
now more than ever the Panthers
have a chance to claim that coveted
title—the East’s number-one team.

The big wins over Villanova and -»

Temple certainly establish Pitt’s
teamas being one of the best, but
only a confrontation with rival

Maryland will determinesthe King "

of the Hill."

BY STEVE SYBERT

The Pitt Hockey Club was
waiting for lightning to strike twice
at the Pitt Invitational Tournament
last weekend, and it did—but it
was the Panthers who got the
shock. '

The jolt came after only 15
seconds of overtime when Iona

' scored, thus keeping Pitt from the

championship game and a chance
for its second straight tournament

. victory.

"Last year, the Pantherslwon top

.Iona’s 4-3 victory over Pitt put
the Gaeles into the tourney’s ﬁnal
against‘ Brooklyn College, a 13-1
victor over hapless Drexel in the
preliminary contest Saturday.

In Sunday’s championship game,
Iona pulled out another overtime
win, 3-2, to capture the top spot in
the second annual tourney. The
Panthers defeated Drexel, 18-0, in
the consolation game for third-
place. -

In, the Pitt-Iona affair, the
Panthers got two goals from Val
Troy-and another from Gary Fries,
but ‘blew a 3-1 lead in the ﬁnal

7 period.

., ~' .~ . . / -. . . ; * ‘ ' ‘ ~ . ‘ . . ‘

Coach Len Barcalow, who said

good, scrappy team.

the loss was caused by bad strategy
on his part, still feels Pitt is better
than Iona, though his team has yet
to beat the Gaeles.

“I think we canebeat these guys
when we go to New York,” he said.

“We can skate rings around any

one of these New York teams.”
That may be true, but Iona won
because of its persistence in
ﬁnding the puck and its consistent
checking—two characteristics of a

The Panthers’ top two lines
clearly outshone any line the
Gaeles had to offer, but Iona had
nine forwards with noses for the
puck and with hard shots.

Goaltender Larry'Newell looked
excellent in the tourney and
Barcalow feels that he can't be
blamed for the loss to Iona.

“They got the winning goal,” he
said, “after a flare-up in front of
the net. A guy was standing there
all alone and he got the puck and
put it in. That’s all there was to
it.”

From the start, _Pitt’s crushing
win over Dre'xel, proved to be_ no
contest. It marked the second time
in as many years the Panthers have

held an opponent to fewer shots_

than the number of Pitt goals. The
Cats outshot Drexel, 65-14. "
Freshman Curt Hetz picked up
six tallies while Rick Vernon and
Troy contributed four and two,

respectively.

Barcalow was not discouraged by
the loss to Iona. He thinks the
strong showings by Hetz and Fries
portend good things for the club.
“These new guys are fitting in
really well and with Rick Vernon as
the ringleader,” he said. “We'll
be okay."

The Panthers (l-l-O) will have"

their chance to avenge the loss to
Iona when the team travels to New
York City for three games with area
colleges December 20, 21 and 22.
But first, they must think about a
closer matter—Sunday's game
with archrival Carnegie-Mellon
University.

There is no love lost between the
Tartans and the Panthers. C-MU
was Pitt's closest competitor in the
Western Pennsylvania Intercolle-
giate Hockey Association the past
four years, but the Panthers
nevertheless ran away with four
straight championsh.ips.

“We're going to play the

‘Frustrated Five,‘ ” Barcalow said. .

“I have never seen a hockey club
conduct themselves like they do.
They don’t know how to play clean
hockey. ‘

“It will be rough. If they start
something, our guys will take care
of them.‘ C-MU justbetter settle

down and play hockey. We have

gentlemen hockey players——rough,
but gentlemen."

BY STEVE SYBERT

There ‘were a lot of new faces in

the New York Rangers’, lineup

when they invaded the Civic Arena
Saturday to take on the Penguins.

One of these men stood out from‘

the rest.

He was a tall, stocky guy of
Italian origin wearing number 12
on his back. During the warmups,
he skated smoothly around the ice,
and all eyes were upon him.

-Actually, everyone knew who he
was, but couldn’t believe where he
was—in a Ranger uniform. The
man, of course, was Phil Esposito;
a longtime enemy of the team
whose emblem he now displays.

Esposito woke up November 7 as
a Boston Bruin, but that night he
wore red and blue instead of black

_ and gold.

“Don Cherry, the coach, called
me at a quarter to eight in the
morning,” Esposito said, “and told
me he had to talk to me. I thought
two things—I had been traded,
which I was, or he had been ﬁred.
My ﬁrst thought was that I had
been traded. I asked him to whom
and he said, ‘I can’t tell you yet,
but ,let me come down and talk to

9)!

A. you.

Sports is a "cruel business.
Players are treated like pieces of
property, merely assets manipu-
lated for the betterment of a
business—-in this case, a hockey
team. For Esposito, it was the
second such phone call.

“It was probably the toughest
thing I’ve ever had to face in my
.life so far," he said. “I just
couldn’t _believe it was happening
to me again. My ﬁrst reaction was,
‘Man, is it worth, it?”

The ﬁrst phone call came May
15, 1967, and it signaled the
beginning of the biggest hockey-
deal of all time, up until now. Back
then, Esposito merely ‘centered for
Bobby Hull, so his trade to Boston
was a welcome occurrence. The
Hawks sent him with Ken Hodge
and Fred Stanﬁeld, to the Bruins
for Gilles Marotte, Pit Martin and
Jack Norris. Why was it con-
sidered the biggest of all trades?
Just look what the Bruins have
done, then look at the Hawks.

But to Esposito,‘ there is a
greater difference between the ﬁrst
trade and the most recent, which
sent Carol Vadnais and him to New
York’, for Brad Park, Jean Ratelle
and minor league hotshot Joe
Zanussi.

“When I was
Chicago to Boston,” Esposito said,
“it was during the summer and I
wasn’t with the guys. It didn't,

really bother me as much as’it did .

now..I started that year's training‘
camp in Boston. This year, I played-
13 games for Boston, then all of a_

sudden tojbe traded likethat was a’,

traded from, '

really get it off my mind a whole lot
because people kept reminding me
about it,” Grifﬁn said. “I got it off
my mindjust enough because I had
a job to do every Saturday.

“In a way, it was a relief to get
out on the ﬁeld on Saturday even
though I was getting hit pretty hard
and I’d be banged up half the
week. The hitting was a lotlharder
this year. It was rough out there.”

Grifﬁn rushed for more than 100

yards almost every Saturdagxv
starting with his sophomore year. “

He was stopped short in last
season’s Rose Bowl against South-
ern Cal, but his regular-season
streak of 100-yard games reached a
record 31 before Michigan held him
to 46 in the 1975 ﬁnale.

_In winning the 1974 Heisman
over Southern Cal’s Anthony Davis
by 1,920 points; to 819, Grifﬁn
rushed 236 times for 1,620 yards.
This season, he carried 245 times
for 1,357 yards.

  Esposito in Ranger Suit:
  Whiskey in Wine Bottle.,,

real mind-blower. It crushed me, it I

really did.”

There are a _ lot of feelings
involved when a player must pack
up and leave a city in which he’s
lived for nine years, as with
Esposito. Even the toughest athlete
has to have some feelings. , _

“If someone told me he could
change just like that,” Esposito
said, “I’d say he was lying. You’ve
got to have feelings. I certainly do
and I’m not lying about it. I felt
very, very bad about leaving
Boston.

“Saying Good-bye to the guyk
was the toughest things I’ve ever". .

had to do in my life up ’till now.
Playing is tough, but that was
tougher.” * '

Many people think it funny to
hear Esposito’s name and the’
Rangers’ in the same breath. He,
too, ﬁnds it hard to believe. The
initial shock will take a good while
to wear off.

“Sometimes, I’m sitting there
watching television,” he said,
“and I say to myself, ‘New York
Rangers?’ I don’t think my mind
will get oriented to being a Ranger
until probably after the . New
Year.” '

But Esposito is a professional.»-3;‘
He knows the _chance of beingxr-.
traded is all part of his job. He -

joined the Rangers and proceded to
do his usual ‘thing—scoring goals.
‘But he was, soon in for. another
shock.

“I played_with the Rangers that

night,” he said, “and we got beat, -

7-5, but I scored two goals and had
two assists. And in the second
game, I got hurt. I’ missed six or
seven games, which I don’t like to
do.”
