Students Comment on
/Fall Political Action

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

In recent weeks. the emotions
of students have burned white-hot
in the crucible of American poli-
tics. Many are preparing to throw
their largely untapped energies
headlong into the mainstream of
the American electoral process.

Following the lead of Princeton
University. campuses scattered
across the nation have provided
for shutdowns prior to the Nov. 10
election. affording students the
opportunity to actively aid the
campaigns of their favorite politi-
cians.

 An informal Pitt News survey
indicates’ that students here at the.

University would favor the can-
cellation or postponement of
classes so that they might have
some voice in their own gover-
nance.

Each of _the score of students
queried Wednesday afternoon felt
that the fall would be an auspici-
ous time for the debut of en masse
student campaigning.

"That." smiled sophomore Jer-
"is: a beautiful
idea." Thomas favors large-scale
student participation. believing

I that  . gmassively. anybody. can

affect the system."
_ Carol Litman. an‘ English ma-

, jor. concurred. "We can most def-

initely affect the decision-making
process." maintained‘Carol. "We
must ‘make people aware. through
political education."

Though favoring student acti-
vism in principle, several of the
respondents doubted the efficacy
of such a course.

Rick Vatz. a teaching assistant.
said that he was "not convinced of
the effectiveness of campaigning.
but it is probably our most effec-
tive. method." Vatz discounted
both the ordinary and extraordi-
nary means of political change.
noting that "many of us don‘t have
the vote" _and terming violence
“counterproductive."

Aigreeing with the pessimistic
prognosis. Tony Martin of Mon-
roeville stated that "It‘s probably

the only place we can go."

_ Wayne Tillman, a junior, con-
jectured that “. . we’ll have
some weight, but it’s difficult to
say which way,” hinting that stu-
dents might turn public opinion
against them. I

Psychology major Yvonne
Francescon also feels that long-
haired. unkept students could
defeat their own purpose. "If they
want to campaign." declared
Yvonne. "they'll have to change
their image. "

An even more ominious note
was sounded by Joel Hurwitz.
"This is the last.chance.'.7 warned
sophomore H-urwitz. "Student sup-
port for the system will go down
the drain if we fail."

For those whose faith in the sys-
tem has already eroded, cam-
paigning will be successful only if '
it fails. “I think they ought to cam-
paign,” suggested Linda Serody
of Philadelphia. “If they’re disil-
lusioned, hit over the head time
after time, maybe they'll find an-
other way.”

Mary Teggatz. a graduate stu-

dent. also expects the disillusion-
ed to search for another method.

Petition Seeks  

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Jewish students on campus are
mobilizing in an attempt to sus-
pend classroomactivities on Yom
Kippur and to safeguard‘ the rights
of those Jews who choose to ob-
serve the lesser holidays. Yom
Kippur. the Day of Atonement.

I is the solemnest day on the Jew-

ish calendar.

To put pressure on the adminis-
tration. a petition has been in cir-
for the past several

organizer of. the petition. _and
Leonard Wantetick. assistant to
the director of the Foundation. ex-
plained its purpose to the Pitt
News. « .

"In the past." Wanetick assert-.

ed. “professors have scheduled
exams on Jewish holidays. Make-
up for those who were absent have
been invariably ridiculous.“
_Wanetick went on to attack "the
ludicrous policy of Lniversity
punishment. In’ a non-sectarian
~s'chool._" he upheld. "classes are
closed.for-Good Friday and. as 'a

   

rgsuflthof pressure applied, by area, ..'.'W
.-‘iii "  hd* Th‘

ii Jewish Holiday

Jewish community miist also have
a fair share in the deal." ‘

The campaign, according to

Wanetickphas the support of many '

black students. “They see their
struggle in ours, and they sympa-
thize.” ’

Sternberg. elaborating on Wane-
ti’ck‘s statement. pointed outthat

"he seeks the support of Univer- .

sity students and the entire Pitts-
burgh community rather than only
Jews to. demonstrate that the is-
sue.is not exclusively Jewish."

The Hillel Foundations presi-
dent ‘noted that an injunction for-
bidding professor to conduct
exams on Jewish holidays was is-
sued a year ago. but it went large-
ly unpublicized. and Jewish stu-
dents were not aware of' their
rights. "Our endeavors have a
second objective." Sternberg
maintained."'and. that is to alle-
viate the fears students have
about being absent on holidays.

"Forcing the administration to
close‘ on Yom Kippur is only a
first step." he said confidentially.
Te» ‘trope. to .include.. all .holiday‘s -

  

"Hopefully." she explained. “the
liberals will be radicalized."
There were a number of differ-
ing opinions as to whether class-
es should be postponed or cancel-
led, and for what length of time.
Some favored a plan similar to
the Townsend-Laulicht proposal,
in which students who wishedto
campaign would be excused from
classes ten days before the elec-
tion, buttheir responsibility for
the work covered during their ab-
sence would be left to the judg-
ment of each individual professor.

Included in the group was sopho-
more Tony Scalercio. "It should
be left up to the professors." af-
firmed Tony. "but studentsshould

be given credit for worthwhile-

work." ‘

Johnny Clark. a political science
major. was more selective. say-
ing that "political science majors
ought to be given credit."

Others opted for Scott Baum’s
proposal, which asks that the Uni-
versity be shut down the'week be-

fore the election, and that the cal-

endar for the fall term be pushed
back one week after that- —

"Bau_m's idea." offered Mike
Matthews of Pittsburgh."'is the
best plan." ~ _

Eileen Boyle. sophomore nurs-
ing candidate. considers a three
day shutdown period sufficient.
"Campaigning is important." she
argued. "but a week of school is
tooimportant.“

"Really." disagreed sopho-
more John .\/IcGlynn. "one week
out of the term doesn't make much
difference.

Zasloff Reassesses War

Viet Iron ies ]Voted

by SANDY DeVIRGILIO
In 1967. Dr. Joseph J. Zasloff.
L7niversity professor of political
science. spoke at the YMCA Pub-

' lic Affairs Forum. The title of his

speech was Crisis in Vietnam.
Last Thursday. Zasloff spoke
again at the Forum. The title of
his speech‘? "Crisis in Indochina."
According to Zasloff, things
have changed a great deal in
Southeast Asia since the first
American advisors in Vietnam
remarked, “lt’s a little war, but

” it’s the only one we've got.”

The Vietnamese conflict has
stress in neighboring
countries. particulary Laos and
Cambodia.

"1 am struck by a massive

sense of irony when considering
the event in Indochina." said Zas-
loff.

Zasloff. a visiting professor at

i the University of Saigon in 1959-

60. then outlined those "bitterly
ironic" situations which he feels
have resulted from continuation
of the Vietnam war.

1. Through the war,. the United-

States has strengthened the North
Vietnamese government to'a point
where that government‘ might act

as an effective buffer zone to Chi-.

nese agression. -

Zasloff noted that the war has
increased public support of that
government by the Vietnamese
people._ _

"A uniﬁed Vietnam. even under
Cgmmunist control. is better than
a ,weak._war-torn country." main-
tained Zasloff.

2. American presence “creates
conditions . of continued turbu-
.l_ence.” Zasloff suggested that this
turbulence had a great deal to do
with recent events in Cambodia.

He cited the turmoil which led
to the overthrow of Cambodian
Prince Norodom Sihanouk. "the
one man who wascapable of main-
taining some stability and con-

  Grafts Topic

rDr. Bahnson. professor and
chairman of surgery at Pitt. and

chief of surgery at Presbyterian-

University Hospital where he per-I
fromed the world's 37th heart
transplant. addressed a crowd of
.50 in the Student Union Ballroom
June 3. He explained that anti-
bodies within a person would "re-
ject" a transplant in much the
same way that they would act
upon an infection.

To combat this, Dr. Bahnson
said, one method would be to
transplant the organ from a sib-
ling or related donor, and try to

match the types. ‘He noted, how-_

ever, thatthis is not always pos-

sible with, transplants involving ~~

unpaired organs such as the heart,
where the donor would probably
be unrelated to the recipient. In

this case, even though the organs

could partially “match,” the odds
are against the graft being readi-

ply accepted.

“The President felt that, unless

ernment would fall,” said the Pitt-
professor. ‘ ~

-He labeled the extension of the; 
war into Cambodia an effort to

"The idea was to protect the
Lon Nol government. as well as
togain strategical advantage." he I 
theorized. ' ‘ '

Some other drugs used have been...
known to cause complications in
the patient. such as peptic ulcers. —.

Dr. Bahnson attributed the pub- 
lic furor following the first heart‘ 
transplant to the media and the 
publicity surrounding the event.‘ I
He said that there would not have ;
been such a stir for a quiet but;
equally revolutionary experiment.  ;

Commenting on the high cost’
of a heart transplant, Dr. Bahnson -
said that the bill for his patient, 
Ben Anolik, ran to nearly $24,000._
AnoIik’s later readmission to the?’
hospital cost nearly as much. Dr.;,j’
Bahnson explained that the pre--
sent cost is about one-quarter ‘off,
Anolik’s, which was shared by t:

_/~

and the taxpayers.

In the future, Dr. Bahnson re-. ,
marked. researchers will try .-to
develop a better means of pre
serving tissue. He discussednthe
present methods of lowering tem'

The Thi‘rtlllnsita|latIon: Lovell ToMontgomery

 

After reading Mr. Montgom-

L ery’s lengthy letter. which com-

- tmented on many-of the topics I
-. " covered, I realized that he had
-_ missed the point of my article-—
’- it that of financial priority spending.
7' ' Hewent to great trouble to ex-

plain how the money was being

 "spent, rather than considering if

that money had to be spent on

, W those areas in the first place.

‘First. I will deal withtthose

charges which he tags as "a mat—‘ ”
’ ter of opinion."

'I.__stated in myfirst letter that

the “University maintains a large L

administrative bureaucracy.”

 ‘which I described as “a group of
‘ chronic buck-passers."

; This claim is based on some

A amount of t'act. According to The
Pitt News (Feb. 26). during the

1968-69 period. the "wages and
salaries paid to the University's
employees were $63 million."

._ which represents approximately
J _ 60 per cent of the University's.

nearly $100 million in expendi-
tures, and makes Pitt one of the
. largest employers in the city.

The vice chancellor's letter cor-
rectly pointed out three mistakes
in my letter as I count it.‘

The University maintains only
one home for the Chancellor with

A a three-man staff. not two homes.

The Chancellor did not go to
Amsterdam. and the curtains for
the Babcock Room will only cost
$500.

These statements I made were
"unfortunate and I apologize for
_them.

But it must be remembered that

' the first twopoints were discuss- '

ed with the vice ‘chancellor. and I

» honestly tried to convey my im-

pressions of what that discussion
was.

As to the rest of my charges. the
vice chancellor claimed they were
not necessarily false but suppos-

_edly distorted the "true picture."

‘But the professor does not be-

I ‘widening of the war.

'i."If they can't win the war in
South Vietnam. it boggles the
imagination that. by moving into
Cambodia. they will win it there."
he.said. ‘

In conclusion, Zasloff affirmed

that American troops should’ be -

withdrawn from Vietnam.

“And .it‘s quite_clear that the
way to get out. is to get out." he
declared.

which seems to be whatever pic-

He explained why Mr. Wolf “did

Pennsylvania Bar Association.
saying. the University retains him
because. he is an expert of sorts in
advising the University on. legal
and quasi-legal problesm.

But to quote the vice chancellor.
even that evaluation is.simply a
'_‘matter of opinion." 1, _
.’;Mr. Montgomery also pointed
out that the "funds f'or the entire
teaching assistant program have
...‘not‘ . . . been cutin half."

That information- was quoted
from the Apri 13 edition of The
Pitt News. ‘

In the same paper. Len Saxe. a
teaching assistant and moderator
of the executive board of the As-

sociation of Graduate "Students. '

stated. “Undergraduates are be-
ing shortchanged. That, should be
obvious" when 21 teacyhing as-

,sistants have been fired. as the
vice chancellor reported.

; One should note. too that each
teaching assistant earns $1.200’
a termiand the new-University

Cadillac cost $5.000. , ‘
The vice chancellor concluded
his letter by admitting that in the
1968-69 period the University
spent 32.8 per cent of its money on

instruction. V K . ’ '
. He then explained that eliminat-

ing self-balancing items such as;

auxilary enterprises makes the
percentage spent for instruction
55.6 per cent. »

But he forgot to mention that in-'

struction is also a self-balancing
item because it is morethan» paid

’ for by students’ tuitions. $16 mil-
lion. and the state tution supple-.

ment for students. $18 million.‘ '

Admittedly. the vice chancel-
lor's letter has explained a lot
about someiof Pitts finances—a
service rarely offered either to

, the Pitt student or the general
V public who both pay the bill——so
_ my letter at least succeeded in eli-

citing a response beneficial to us
all.
But there is much he didn't ex-
plain. ' 7

Concerning the Chancellor's
home which the University main-
tains. the vice chancellor stated.
“The home. in effect comes with
the job-—a job that requires offi-
cial entertaining and a house big
enough to conduct it in."

He forgot to mention that the

_ Chancellor has the use of other

University facilities to entertain
in. such as his 12th floor suites in
Bruce Hall.

He also failed to elaborate on
how entertainment has anything
to do with the University supply-

r --ing a home for the Chancellor. ‘

Probably "the Chancellor has
no. choice but to live in it," How-
ever. do the taxpayers and the stu-
dents want to pay for it? ’
Vice..Chancellor.’why the Chan-
cellor take a trip and the Univer-
sity buy a Cadillacyduring what

- was described by-all. as Pitt's fi-

nancialcrisis. _
These expenses were made
lwhen, the University had been
forced to "borrow upwards of $20
milliontat an interestrate of near-
ly $5.000 a day." ' L -

Why does the ‘University? need
$45.3 million from the state. $7.4
million above what the Governor
proposes. He failed to pointout
that if the state doesn't pay. each

students tuition will probably be_‘_
increased. but why -do we. the ‘

studentsand the’ taxpayers. have
to pay? ' t ,  

The vice chancellor would most
likely an_swer. as it was‘ asserted
‘in the Feb. 26 Pitt News, by say-
ing. that the University's—— em-

wage and _Pittsburgh’occupational =

But he would probably forget to I

mention that the city loses a pos-
sible . $1.400.000 r _in taxes from
the institutions of higher learning,

onstrated in a Geography 142 dis-
play in the Hillman Library.

And the institution that benefits
the most by far is the University
of Pittsburgh.

The vice chancellor would prob-_
ably include in his picture of Pitt's
progress such things as these.
which can be-found .in Pitt's an-
nual report to the public.

1) a 62 per cent increase in en-
rollment from 13.001 full-time
students in 1965 to 21.018 this
year (Pitt News, May 15 1 1, ,

2) a 45 per cent increase in what

V was spent on student services

from $1.1 million spent for the 11
months ending June 30. 19671 to
$1.6 million spent for the. year
ending on June 30. 1969; A

5) a 72 per cent increase in
the operating budget of the ad-

ministration from $2.9 to $4.98

million.

Add to these expenditures the
fact that the University:

1) funded $243.000 to the Of-
fice of the Chancellor and $445.000
to the affairs of the.Vice Chancel-
lor of Finances. Mr. Montgomery.
during 1968-69. according to its
operating budget;

2) paid $135.00 for maintain-
ance of grounds during 1968-69;

3) spends $16 million a year

on consumable suplies (Pitt News, Q‘
Feb. 26). V g , *‘2a’

The Chancellor claims that
Pitt's unique relationship with the

‘state allows many students, to

reap the benefits of this institu-
tion. and enables Pitt to make
documented strides and ‘increases
in many areas which would have.
been ‘ impossible

And yet, shouldn’t the education
of the students be the top priority‘
at Pitt? Is it. or will it bein the
foreseeable future? .

-The students‘ education is not
the first priority at Pitt. but rath-
er the greatestconcentration of
expenditures seems

ing my education._ . — '

Just so no one misses the point
of this letter. it is: better man-
agement and priorities should be

- established. toreduce the waste

and add more for truly education-

  Proves Costly To
Panther Mitt Squad

by MARTY HELLMAN

Any team that is victorious in
two-thirds of its games during a
season should naturally be happy
about its accomplishments. This
years Panther baseball team.
which posted a 14-7 record over
the two—month spring season. has
mixed emotions about the abrupt
campaign. .

Coach Bobby Lewis summed up_
his feelings -about the year by say-
ing. "We played real well all of
the time. and I can't say that we
kicked any of the games away. It
seems that our biggestproblem

in all of our losses was the inabil-
ity to get a timely hit.“

Of the seven games that the
mitters dropped. six of them were
decided by one or two runs. The
pitching staff. which compiled an
overall 2.19 ERA. kept the Pan-
thers close in every game except
the nightcap of a Syracuse double-
header. 5

“The pitching was as strong
this year as it has ever been,”
commented Lewis. “Some of them
had their wild spells; but I can’t
fault any of them because none of
them had the chance to pitch reg-
ularly because of all the rainouts
during the season.” «-

Bob Solonickne. [the team's
leading hitter and voted by the

- squad as the MVP ofthis year and
captain for next, said, "The team

was tough all over this year. We

were really never out of conten-

tion in anyigamef‘

The one game -which most of

the-diamondmen regretted to lose
was the 3-2 loss to Bucknell. Ron"

we were-leading 2-0 goinginto the

ninth inning and we felt that we.

had the game wrapped‘up.~"

I The building of a baseball field
for the Panthers’ use was a great
asset this year. “I am thrilled of
having our own field after all of
the years of playing away,” said
Lewis. ,_“Our ground crew did a

Fran Webster is launching a
campaign for better tennis at Pitt.

He has devised a two-pronged
attack on the problem. First he
needs to attract talented players
and secondly he wants improved

= facilities.

Players will be his most im-
portant asset.,Webster is begin-
ning a vast recruiting program by
contacting 43 area high schools
with a detailed questionnaire.-

The questionnaire will elicit in-
formation that will enable Web-
ster to obtain a cross-section of
the best high school tennis players.

The form also requests aca- ‘ I

demic information’ on the pros-
pective players. The coach hopes
to attract players who are pri-
marily interested ina good edu-

. catio"n..as the academic program

at Pitt is far superior to the ten-

_ nis program. .

. It is also hoped that the recruit- .

ing efforts will improve relations

_ with the high . school ‘coaches.

remarkable job in preparing the»

-field -for play on'many oc'casion_s,”

Pitt's lack of interest in tennis in
the past has fostered a lack of in-
terest in Pitt among the area
coaches. ‘

Getting players.is only half the
battle. Keeping them is another
story. ,

Three-fourths of the tennis‘
schedule is played - during the
spring term "when -many. of the
players are not taking classes.

"I_1ost five or six players at the’

.beginning of “the term." stated
Webster. "Any one of them.might
have played varsity. Twofof them
certainly, would have played."
