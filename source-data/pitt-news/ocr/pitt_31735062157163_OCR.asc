Players Three-in-One Program

Features Workmaster Drama

tainment are slated for this week-
end when Pitt Players present
“Curtain Time,” a program of
three experimental one-act plays
staged in Foster Memorial Hall
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
at 8:30.

Produced, directed, and written
or adapted by students, the three
productions represent a new idea
in,the theatre, at least in this city.
In “Existent,” written by Pitt
senior Stuart Workmaster, a psy-
chological character study is ap-

what amounts to a dramatized
editorial. Noel .Coward’s comedy,
“Fumed Oak,” boasts a theatrical
rarity in its director, Bete Bucci,
one of the few female directors
ever connected with Players. ,
The evening’s Curtain-dropper is

gar Allen Poe’s “Tell-Tale Heart.”

with eerie, macabre staging, light-
ing, andsound effects, the drama
is expected to touch off a ﬂock of

“Existent” features Jack Steele,

inspired by a“ note left by one of
seven miners found dead in a
pocket of the‘ 1940 Sonman Mine
cave-in. Directed by Bob Lloyd,
“Existent” promises to be an eve-
ning’s entertainment in itself.

In addition to thethree Play-
ers veterans, “Fumed Oak” intro-
duces Jennie Marshall in her first

thor as his best one—act comedy,
“Fumed Oak” provides a refresh-

Dick Hazley’s pantomime pro-
duction of the Poe thriller em-
ploys such weird effects as lumi-
nous make-up, bizarre sound ef-
fects, and surrealistic staging to
make “The Tell-tale Heart” a
hellish interlude of horror in
which the only words are spoken
by the narrator, Hazely, while a
cast headed by Ed Nestor acts out
the story. Ed Tucker handled the
diﬁicult directing job.

Tickets for the three-in-one
production are 75 cents at the stu-
dent desk.

their slate for the men’s elections
last night culminating a three
week wait since the naming of the
Congress and Men’s Council Can-

presented by the Men's Nominat-

Blackstone will be a write—in

Also on the list was Stuart
Workmaster, prominent independ-

siderable merit” according to a
member attending the slate meet-

The slate for Student Congress
consists of Sam Simpson, Larry

Training in Politics
Rated Part of School

Members of Pitt Independent

Association reaffirmed their stand-

in favor of political speakers and
political clubs at a general meet-
ing last Thursday.

Deﬁnite adoption of the plank
commits the eight PIA and PIA-
backed candidates to a similar line
of action. _

Acting as spokesmen for his or-
ganization, Ray Pluskey, Associa-
tion president, advanced three
points in favor of political action.

1. Political experience is a
necessary part of education.

2. Students should prepare
themselves in college for life,
and politics is a part of that
preparation.

3. Individuals are challenged
to work actively according to
their beliefs when political clubs
are present.

Pluskey emphasized that the
Association envisioned only tem-
porary organizations. *

“After all,” he said, “elections
don’t come every year. Full time
politics is only for professional

’ Elections this year havearoused more interest

from more people than has been apparent on
campus since the daysof the pre-war era.
But talk will avail the individuals, or the
groups, little if anything. Votes are what
count. “

Pitft now has all the ingredients for turning’

out a record vote. All that is needed is the
proper mixing of the ingredients. VVe think it
is to the best interests of the school and the
"studentbody generally that that mixing take
place——tomorrow. ‘ ' ’
The point to be kept in mind, ,we feel, is

I that school politics are important. They’re im-

portant because, whether the student realizes
it or not, theyaﬁect him in many ways. A
good part of this life during four years is spent
under the administration of these same school
politics. It is only good common sense that
the student do whatever he can to see that
his interests and ideals are_ served by the offi-
cials who determine schdol policy. The way to
do this is to vote for the men who ‘he feels
willbest represent liim. Exercise your right
tomorrow; get out and vote for a better Pitt.

Today the first concrete evidence of sum-
mer‘ arrives with the opening home ‘game of

The b6ys in Forbes Field look a little better

more patrons than last year.

With’ the popularity of the Pirates, how-

ever, comes the year’s biggest headache for

Pitt students. Long about 1:30p. m. every day,

Schenley plaza begins’to get a bit on the

crowded side. By 2 p. In. the patron is look-
ing for places to park which ain’t. So, he makes

his own. And the Pitt student, who is attend- 
sing a class from 1:30 to 2:30 ﬁnds his car

hemmed in on all sides. He must wait until

police will cooperate with the Pirate officials

rons. » _
‘At this point we wonder‘ if Lt. Flavin’s*’ooys

the parking lines in Schenley Pljiza are‘ not

it costs the offender two dollars; during base-
ball season (at game time, that is) it costs

Buf There's More to if ‘
Than Meet the Eye

Issue
By Bill Veénis

Many letters have crossed my desk since the
death of Jock Sutherland and the subsequent ar-
ticle by Chet Smith in the Pittsburgh Press.

In every instance, these letters have call-
ed for immediate action onvthe move to re-
name Pitt Stadium “Sutherland Memorial Sta.-
dium.” And in no instance yvere they penned
by some inveterate agitator.

In fact, one of the letters was written by Lois
Rowbottom Mohn, my first editor here on the News
Staff. Lois writes that a Sutherland Memorial Sta-
dium would be “the kind of memorial that Pitts-
burgh (and more particularly Pitt) owes to the man
who gave us reason to sing “Hail to Pitt” during
the _football seasons.” '

Lois is right; the other letters are, too; Chet
Smith deserves credit for the idea.

I But isn’t there one point everyone seems to

overlook? * _
What happened here at Pitt when Jock Suther-
land resigned? The press, the public, most stu-
dents and faculty felt that he was shoved out on
his proverbial ear. Whether the opinion is-‘rightior
not, I have not been able to ascertain. There’s tes-
timony on both sides. -But, the ouster ideas exists.
The question, then, isn’t “Should the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh name its stadium ‘Suth-
erland Memorial Stadium’?” It’s simply
“Does Pitt have the right to instigate the re-
naming of ‘its stadium, or any other building,
with ‘Sutherland7?” ‘ ,
My guess is that the adm'inistration_'doesn’t, the
faculty doesn’t, ‘and, through lack of knowledge
of the man, ' the student body doesn’t have that
right. Actually it belongs to an outsider—one of
position and known leanings wtoward Sutherland,
before and after the 1938 episode. An active alum-
ni, perhaps.‘ Ainewspaperman, perhaps.iBut,; con-
sidering the opinion the public has -of theiSuther-
land controversy, not one of these connected too
closely with the University should investigate the
«move. 4- V I
Another point to consider is the advisability
of renaming the stadium. To all citizens, it

‘ is the Pitt Stadium. It shall remain as such re-
gardless of the name on a plaque ‘outside gate
No. 3. The habit and term is too long used to
be forgotten or substituted .for readily. It
would be a tribute ‘in name only. ,

From the standpoint of‘ perpetuation, a’ more
ﬁtting tributeto the man would be a new building,
one involving money and time expended, rather
than sentiment alone. The University ,.has -a ﬁeld
hous_e—student union on the planning. board. .That
might, be well worth while. In fact, it would be
ideal in encompassing all attributes of a real me-
morial to a great man.

fair, for Mrs. Eckl was the pianist
at the studio.

Ballet Begins Early

.An interest in ballet claimed
Shirley early. While still attend-
ing-Carrick High school, she spent
her summers in New York study-
ingballet with Anatole Vilzak and
the American Ballet’ School. Then,
immediately after graduation from
high school, she headed towards
Times Square for a career with
the Ballet Theatre.

Career was right! For six years
Shirley ‘studied, rehearsed, danc-
ed, traveled, directed ,and traveled
some more. Twice a year the Bal-
let ' Theatre toured the United
States. During. the time she was

' with the group, it also played in

Canada, Mexico, Cuba, and Lon-
don. ‘ ,
’ Traveling Was Tough
‘ “Traveling was the hardest part

of the trouping,” she recalls. The '

only time anything exciting hap-
pened on a trip was when a train
carrying the entire company went
- off the tracks “in the middle of
Montana.” That was one perform-
ance .she would have preferred
missing, even though nobody was

‘ hurt.

While with the Ballet group,
Shirley was not only a member
of the ensemble, -but quite often
isoloistin “Tally Ho.” Whenever
they were on tour, she acted as
substitute choreographer and put
the company through its paces at
"rehearsals.

, " Home to Pittsburgh

_ By.-the spring of 1947, Shirley

was “so tired” that she decided

to “come home to Pittsburgh and

rest for a year.” Her use of the
iword “rest” might be question-
~ ed,jfor in September she registered

at ‘the, University and began to
struggle with freshman English.

, While at Pitt, she has been far

‘ﬁﬁfrom inactive. When the Cap and

“Gown show needed a dance di-
ector, Shirley ﬁlled the" position.

Ballet Preferenies

On the modern ballet, the bal-
lerina talks freely and intelli-
gently. She prefers “Fancy Free,”
“Tally Ho,” and ‘.‘Bluebeard” to
any of the older classics. ,

“Fancy Free” is one of the best
ballets ever written,” she ex-
claims. “It has good music, good
dancing, and characters that
everybody can understand. And
those a{~e”the things that will
bring ballet to the general public!”

Favorites in Theater

Leonard. Bernstein, the compos-
‘er of “Fancy Free,” stands high
in the young lad_y’s favor. She
thinks he has done more for the
modern ballet than any other
composer. She also praises Agnes
DeMille, the choreographer.

» As to the local dance scene, V

Shirley thinks the Civic Light p-
era has been “very good for Pitts-
burgh. The only troubleiis that

Man Who Assisted Dr. Einstein
Now Teaching Math at University

By Peg Evans
It’s more than rumor! There is

a man at Pitt who assisted Dr.
Einstein at Princeton University
and that man, Dr. Valentine Barg-
mann, has the published works
which they did together to prove
it. l

“Annals of Mathematics,” con-
cerning bivector ﬁelds, appeared
in 1944; Dr. Albert Einstein and
Dr. V. Bargmann’s names are on
the ﬂy-leaf of the book. This was
a direct outgrowth of Dr. Barg-
mann’s work as assistant to Dr.
Einstein at Princeton University
from 1940-1943.

Dr. Bargmann, a short stocky
man with thinning dark hair, has
his office on the fourth ﬂoor of
the Cathedral. An associate pro-
fessor at Pitt since February, 1948,
Dr. Bargmann has behind him a

list of study and teaching that is
varied and extensive.

In his undergraduate days, Dr.
Bargmann was a student at the
University of Berlin. Graduating
in 1940 from that school, he ac-
cepted a teaching position with the
same University where he stayed
until 1932.

Leaving his alma mater in 1932
he soon moved to the Univer-
sity of Zurich, Switzerland, where
he completed a teaching term of
three years. i

A mathematician and ‘a scientist,
Dr. Bargmann ﬁnds interests in
many ﬁelds of physics and mathe-
matics. In addition to the afore-
mentioned books, this young
mathematician published in 1941
works concerning the ﬁve dimen-
sional representation of gravita-

tion and electricity.

Dr. Einstein, now an American
theoretical physicist, also taught
at the University of Zurich in
1909. He advanced his theory of
relativity in 19115, and in 1932
left Germany because of his na-
tionality. He associated with the

faculty of the Institute of Ad-
vanced Study at Princeton’ Uni-
versity in 1933.

When Dr. Bargmann came to
this country, he, too, went to
Princeton where he became an
assistantrto Dr. Einstein. In 1943,
after serving in this "capacity for
three years, he became a mathe-
matics instructor there.

Five-foot—six—inches in height,
Dr. Bargmann belies the vast sci-
entiﬁc knowledge which is his.
He is married and lives in Pitts-
burgh where his teaching duties
are heavy but do not hinder his
participation in other activities.

Dr. Bargmann is a member of
the American Physical Society. He
is an active member of the Ameri-
can Mathematical Society, and be-
longs to Sigma Xi, national science
fraternity. '

The Piano Business Gets a LlF'l'

"(when Alcoa Aluminum Castings Replace Heavy Metal

Even a well-trained husband who’ll re-
arrange the living room every Spring balks
at piano-moving. You can see the main
reason above. It’s the big metal plate that
holds the strings-—and it has always tipped
the scales at around 125 pounds.

No wonder it gave the piano business a
lift when a progressive piano builder re-

- placed the heavy iron

weighing 45 pounds-—m,ade of ‘ Alcoa
Aluminum. As perfected,
from our foundries is strong to resist the
18-ton pull of the taut strings. It is stabi-
lized to provide tonal quality and stay in
tune. And its cost today is competitive
with the old-fashioned cast-iron plate.
With other advantages, in other indus-

tries Alcoa Castings are effecting similar
changes. In one plant, their corrosion re-
sistance means no painting, simple ﬁnish-
ing. In another, they are liked for their
superior machinability. Instill another,
they are preferred forvthe ease with which
they swing through production, where
iron castings had to be hauled by truck
or hoisted on heavy cranes. .
The change from heavy metal castings
to Alcoa Aluminum Castings is a revolu-
I ti.onary switch in product engineering.
Old, old habits are being questioned as
engineers re-evaluate metals—with a .

. ful as theadrninistration decides

The Board of Trustees recent

By John Colightlv

Expected to Maintain Status

‘ Quo on Athletic Committee

report has resulted in a lot of

wishful thinking. The faint-hearted have dropped the issue and are
willing to tag along. You can bet that in the next crisis these same
people will be the lion-hearted who will roar demands, snarl at
personalities, and demand explanations.

For one‘ thing, the Trustees led’
everyone to believe that their de-
cision would be the ﬁnal one. This
belief has been proven to be ab-
surd. I do not think there is any-
thing in the report which has
brought order out of chaos.

Administration Retains Control

It has only postponed chaos un-
til a later date. A few people have
hailed point number 10 in the re-
port. They claim it has increased
the power of Athletic Director
James Hagan.

I fear these people are mis-
guided. Under point 10, the ath-
letic director shall administer
“the athletic ﬁnances as a de-
partment of the University.” This,
of course, names the department
of athletics will be only as power-

it "shall be.

I feel certain the Stadium debt
will continue to be a responsibility
and liability of the department of
athletics. As everyone should
know, the Stadium debt is the
real reason for our tough sched-
ules.

There is bound to be plenty of
compromises before the new Ath-

letic Committee meets. It is pret-
ty generally known that the .ad—
ministration does not -— at this
time—want any changes in ath-
letic personnel.

The four faculty members will
have as their goal maintenance
of the status quo, and this view-
point will probably prevail.

My feeling is that some people
in the administration wishto ban-
ish James Hagan. No one has
spoken a word in his defense.
Since Hagan has been with the
athletic department for 19 years,
someone must have formed an
opinion. .

Two Theories on Hagan

There are two theories about
James Hagan. Either he loves the
University very much and will
put up with anything to remain,
or he is stubborn and will stay un-
til asked to leave. There may,
however, be something drastic on
Hagan within three months.

Every University has its fac-
tions, and I regret that Coach
Mike Milligan has been mouse-
trapped in Pitt’s latest factional
ﬁght. I think Mike will stand by
for the duration of his contract.

Track iTe‘am Favored
Over Ohio Varsity

By Rob Van Atta
Track makes its ﬁrst competitive appearance of the spring at
the Stadium this afternoon as «the Panther thinclads host for Ohio
University’s Bobcats at 3:30 p. m. Carl Olson’s proteges are favored
in the opener of their dual meet card.

Panther Baseba||iNine Shows
At Geneva This Afternoon

The Pitt baseball team journeys to Geneva today, giving
the Pittsburgh Pirates an opportunity to hold the local spot-

light.

Ralph Mit-ter1ing’s nine takes on the Covies in the season ’s
only scheduled game between the two teams.

Pitt began the 1948 season with¢

a limp by dropping their ﬁrst two
games to Penn State. The Lions
nipped the Panthers, 2-1, Friday
and 15-8, Saturday.

The only cheerful aspect of the
disastrous weekend was the dis-
covery of a new slugging star in
Pitt's Jim Couch. The stocky
rightﬁelder clubbed a home run
on Friday and two-triples and a
double on Saturday.

Pitt had only seven hits over
the entire 18 innings, and four of
them were Couch’s.

Deryl Calder twirled for the
Panthers in their ﬁrst game and
gave up only one run until the
ninth inning when he grew wild.
Two walks and an error ﬁlled the
bases and Calder threw three
straight balls to Gene Solomon
before reliefer Rudy Hudec rush-
ed to the mound to complete the
walk. ‘

In Saturday’s game Sammy
David started for the Panthers.
He was succeeded by Bobby Luc-
chino, George Schmidt, and Rudy
Hudec.

Penn State’s double win made
it four straight over Pitt. Last
year the Lions were the last op-
ponent on the schedule, and cap-
tured two games by 7-1 and 7-2
scores.

Golfers Host
For Juniata

This afternoon the Panthers
start their quest for a victorious
golf season by teeing off against a
sextet of J uniata Indians at "Shan-
nopin Country Club, near Ben
Avon.

Doing the swinging for Pitt will
be Andy Mihocko, Bill Franke-
vitch, Bill Burress, Dan Langdon,
A1 McBride, and Lou Ferraro. All
are veterans from last year’s
squad except Burress.

Juniata brings a squad that
sports four lettermen. Their prob-
able lineup will show Blair Miller,

Jay McCardell, Ray Korody, Orv ~

Dore, John Burych, and Fred Dan-
naway.

The Indians had a .500 season
last year, winning matches from
Baltimore and Bucknell, and los-
ing a return round with Bucknell
as well as a setto with Western
Maryland. .

Ed Kiracofe will bring the In-
_dians to Pittsburgh in the absence

of the coach, Jack Oller, who is
on leave of absence to visit the
Olympics in Europe.

Frat Softball

Interrupted occasionally by rain
and bucking a stingingwind, SAE
and SAM managed to put seven
innings of softball together. Fri-
day at Trees Field with Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon winning, 12-2.

Baffled by the pitching of SAE’s
Bentley, who struck out eight, the
Sigma Alpha Mu squad was shut
out until the sixth inning. A dou-
ble by Saul Perlstein and a single
by Sherry Mendleblatt drove in
the Sammie runs.

A The Epsilon men capitalized on '

errors and timely hitting to score
three runs in the ﬁrst and six in
the second. A homer by MacDon-
ald in the fourth inning with one
man on base boosted the score to
11-0. Marv Sheﬁler was the losing
pitcher.

In another Trees Field game
Friday, the Comets turned back
a fourth inning Kappa Nu rally

,to eke out a 5-4 win in Coast

fourth with four singles and a ‘ 5

double but failed to even the
count. .

HERE’S BIG George ‘Matich
springing after a foul ball.

Matich has emerged as’ Pitt's‘

ﬁrst-string catcher from among
a half dozen candidates.

Matich's Steady Play
Wins Catching Berth

By Myron Kopelman
Less than a month ago, Baseball Coach Ralph Mitterling re-
marked that George Matich might not be his ﬁrst string catcher

this season.

He said that’George Schweinbatten, Virgil Fassio, Al Satriano,

Mark Maystrovich, and Charley¢

Varro were all looking so good

that the position was as much

one man’s as another. '
Better Than ’47 Form

Matich didn’t quiver. He just
kept playing his steady brand of
ball, and as the team went out-
and as the intra-squad
games progressed, there was
George in the berth of ﬁrst-string
receiver.

The Clairton husky -has even
shown better form than he did in
1947. Matich is a more dependa-
ble policeman when the base steal-
ers become active.

“Throwing on runners, I think,
is the toughest part of catching,”
says George. “But nipping the
runner does not depend complete-
ly on the catcher. The pitcher has
to know how to hold the runner
close to the sack.

Likes Rough Position

“Some pitchers overlook that
obligation. Here at Pitt, however,
I’ve been fortunate enough to
work with pitchers who are
aware of it.”

But why did Matich become a
catcher? Many players avoid the
position because it’s too rough.
“Certainly, catching is rough, but
that’s why I like it,” explained
Matich. “I get a kick out of
blocking up ho-me plate when a
runner comes ﬂying in trying to
score)’,

Pitt fans will testify that Matich
actually “gets a kick” on frequent
occasions.

“Another thing about catching,”
continued Matich, “is the fact that
you’re in on every. p1ay—if not
catching the ball, at least calling

a signal. That's probably one of
the main reasons why I’ve always
been a catcher.” ‘

Like so many other collegiate
athletics, 26-year-old George has
the GI Bill of Rights to thank for
his position"in the college lime-
light.

After being graduated from
Clairton High in 1939, he worked
ﬁve years in the steel mills, went
to the Navy for 27 months, and
then came to Pittin September
of 1946.

five walks and ﬁve Sweetheart

Sigma Chi lost no time taking
control of the game. Eleven men

nings were the fourth and sixth,
in which they scored ﬁve runs

Hitting star of the day was
Hank Oltman, center ﬁelder of
Sigma Chi, with two home runs,
a double, and a single in four of-
ficial trips to the plate.

Norman Perry was the winning
pitcher, and Wilber Whitsett the
losing hurler. Neither received ef-
fective support.
