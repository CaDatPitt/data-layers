Pitt Will
negotiate
space for
new office
complex ‘

By Jack Finn

' Asst. News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh is
negotiating with developers to
build a new office complex on
the existing site of the former
Burger Kingcand Your Campus
Book Store on Fifth Avenue
between Oakland.Avenue and
Bouquet Street.

“The university has sent
requests for proposals to 16
developers,” Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Property
Acquisition and Management
James Watters said.

“We hope to have their

response by_ early November,”

he said. \_ V _

Although the university will
have input into the design
and use of the building,
the developer will be responsi-
ble for constructing and leasing
the space, according to Wat-
t€l‘S.

“We will ground—lease the
property so this isnot seen as a
Pitt project,” he said.

“Based on allowable zoning
ordinances, it suggests that
a building of nearly 100,000

square feet could" be built,”_
Watters said.

-City of Pittsburgh ordinances
will require internal parking for

‘any structure built.’

Watters said that Pitt is look-
ing at‘ the possibility of leasing
some of the space in the pro-
posed building to help the
developer secure financing for
the project. ,

“We recognize the economic
realities of today, and we are
prepared to assist the developer
by guaranteeing a tenant if
that’s what they need,” Watters
said. I

When the lease is up for
the property, the building

GPSA addresses grad aate   women (9

By Cameron Harvey
Staff Writer

The Graduate and
Professional Student Association
is establishing a women’s’orga—
nization to fill the needs of Pitt"s
graduate and professional
women.

“Women face different choic-
es and roadblocks in this part of
their life [as graduate students]
that the men just don’t have to
face,” said GPSA member Lori
Shorr. “Grad students tend to be
older, the" average being 55

years old when they get their

Ph.D. A lot of women have to .

put off getting their Ph.D.
because they have children.
This group is trying to solve
problems such as this.”
According to Shorr, GPSA
gave the interested women
money to start the group and to
see what needs have to be met.
“The idea [for the group]
came from my work with the
Coalition for Childcare, [an
organization designed to find
child care for graduate and pro-
fessional women]. I realized that

there wasn’t any organization
for female graduate students,”
Shorr said. “We envision a
place, not only. for women to
socialize, but to discuss things
that are happening specifically
on campus.”

Letters to all graduate and
professional women had been
sent out informing them of this
new organization. '

Shorr described the responses
from both students and faculty
as being “very excited.”

“I think that it’s a good idea
for female graduate students to

infection

By Brian Lehew
Staff Writer

Pennsylvania Gov. Robert

P. Casey spent last night
at Presbyterian-University
Hospital undergoing treatment
for a minor infection of the
esophagus, according to
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center spoke-sperson Jane

, Duffield.

\\’/hen the governor went
in for a routine checkup
and heart biopsy on Tuesday,
doctors admitted him ‘after dis-
covering flu—like symptoms and
a drop in his red blood cell
count.

Dr. William Follansbec, direc-
tor of cardiovascular services at
the University's Heart Institute,
said the governor’s infection is

“imm inently treatable” with

intravenous medication, accord-
ing to Duffield.

The infection was discovered‘

during tests of the gastrointesti-
nal tract performed on Tuesday
to test for viruses and to check
for possible sources of blood
loss suspected in connection
with his lowered red blood cell
count.

be brought together. It is an

excellent vehicle for addressing

the. concerns of women from
the different [graduate schools

at Pittl,” said GPSA member

Hayley Thompson.

GPSA member Sean Lewis
said, “The issues that affect
women need to be addressed in

every sphere that men and

women find themselves. I
would support the formation for
that reason.” The organization is
not yet’ politically active. Its
direction rests upon its mem-
bers’ wants, Shorr said.

IFC decides to participate in the Oakland Cleanup project

By Matt Groff '

X Asst. News Editor

All members of the Inter—Fraternity
Council gave their support to the
Oakland Clean-up project at last night’s
meeting. ‘

Students participating in the project,
coordinated by IFC community service
Chair Brian D. Angelo, will try to clean
‘up the streets of Oakland on Saturday,
Oct. 25. c

“We are waiting to see how many peo-
ple sign up,” ‘Angelo said. '
__“But hopefully we will have enough

to: assign different areas of Oakland to

different "groups. We invite other student
organizations and the public to join this
effort.” 4 ' ,
IFC _ Internal Vice President
Jason Huey, who conducted the meet-
ing. in’ the’ absence of President
Jeremy Weiss, said he hopes there is
support for Angelo’s long-temi plans as

well.

“We want to continue Greek v.olun—
teerism after clean-up day in the form of
an "adopt—a-highway’ type project,” Huey
said. 4 I ’

“Fraternities and sororities can join
with commercial sponsors to keep the
streets clean and improve the overall
appearance of Oakland.”

Edward Ifft, external president of IFC,
announced a fraternity member auction
to be held on Wednesday, Oct. 27 at

Zelda’s. _ _

One member of each fraternity will
be auctioned to the highest bidder,
who will then receive a free dinner
with that fraternity member. The auction
will benefit the Make—A-Wish
Foundation.

“Hopefully we will be able to grant
one wish, which means raising $3,000-
4,000,” Ifft said.

Students should be more open after breakups

In a previous column I wrote
about the breakup of a love
relationship and described the
grief process that students typi-
cally go through when this
occurs. Since this experience

i is so common throughout the

college years, it seemed impor-
tant to offer other suggestions
for coping with this traumatic
loss. ‘

1. Since the end of a relation-
ship is often a signiﬁcant loss, it
is important to allow yourself
time to grieve.

Keeping a stiff upper lip or
pretending that you are not
hurting doesn’t help. You can’t

heal what you refuse to notice.

Let the tears flow and experi-
ence your hurt feelings.

2. If you are the rejected per-
son in a terminated relationship,
you probably feel anger and
resentment. Become aware of
this anger and admit it to a
friend and to yourself. Owning
that part of you which is out-

raged is important.

3. Be aware of the fact that
some of the beliefs you develop
during this crisis may not be
helpful. Beliefs such as: “It’s all
my fault,” “I’ll never be able to
trust anyone again,” “No one

make now may not suit you a
few months later.

Small changes, however, can
be very therapeutic and give
you a sense of control. Try to

to your feel-
ings of self-worth and well-
being may help.

5.Treat yourself the way you
treat your friends. Don’t blame
yourself for everything that has
gone wrong, but don’t let your-

self off the hook for your own
contributions to the relation-
ships problems.

We can learn a great
deal about ourselves in the
midst of a crisis and can often
come out of it stronger and
wiser.

Sometimes the pain of a bro-
ken relationship is so intense
that it seems impossible to
muster the energy to attend
to suggestions such as these.
When your own coping strate-
gies aren’t working and talking

to your friends doesn’t help, i

you might want to
seek some professional help at
the Counseling Center (648-
7930).

The center will also offer a
workshop this fall that may help
called “Saying Goodbye.” Just
don’t give up on yourself and
remember that you are not
alone. It is a rare person who
goes through life without hav-
ing his or her heart broken at
least once.

Comz'cBoo/e Club is not all comics, also sci-fl telez/z'sz'o7/z

By Randy Knapick ~
Staff‘ Writer

To a casual listener a discus-
sion centering on interstellar
travel, robotic warriors and rela-
tionships between supernatural
beings may be foreign and
peculiar if not bizarre.

Yesterday "afternoon, howev-
er, people in .the William Pitt
Union spoke of these subjects
as if they were an ordinary part
of our earthly existence.

This is the world  rather,
these are the worlds of Pitt’s
Comic Book Club. I

That name is somewhat
deceiving, however, because
the club’s biweekly meetings
usuallydiverge into many facets
of science fiction as well.

At yesterday’s meeting the
club members present touched
on subjects ranging from the
“disappointing” season premier
of “Star Trek; The Next
Generation” to the “pointless”
role of Ewoks in Return of tbe

jedi, in addition to comic books.

Club Vice President William
Barlow said that by using
Ewoks in the Star Wars trilogy,
the writers were really “grasping

for stuff.”

In addition Barlow said he
would have been “more

impressed if the Imperial Star
Fleet had built a harbor for Star
Destroyers” in Return oft/9e_/edi
instead of repeating the Death
Star fiasco.

The club also contemplated
whether or not the Starship
Enterprise should expandwhen
entering warp speed “in direct
violation” of warp theory,
according to Barlow.

“I don’t mind the fact that the
ship can operate and everybody
doesn’t turn into energy,”
Barlow said. “But I can’t deal
with the fact that when some-
thing goes the speed of light
that itjs going to expand.”

Barlow concluded that 200].-
A Space Odyssey is the most
realistic space fantasy, though it
does not possess the awing
capability of the other movies.

“That's accurate space,” he
said, “and a fairly boring
movie.” A

Perhaps these tangential con-
versations reﬂect the club’s cur-
rent period of transition.

The Comic Book‘ Club,
formed in 1990, will soon incor-
porate Japanese animation into
its domain of topics.

“\X/e’re changing our focus,”
Barlow said. .

ship, Barlow, who is in Pitt’s

Asian studies program, would
like to “move toward a Japanese
animation format.”

Last year, Barlow estimates
between 30 and 40 people
turned out for the club’s show-
ing of theJapanese film A/aim.

Barlow saw  good
response” from non-comic col-
lectors and said students, who
have an interest in Japanese cul-
ture like himself, would appre-
ciate an outlet for Japanese ani-
mation on campus.

“We also get a lot of support
from the Gaming Club when we
show these films,” Barlow said.

Such a club would be more
like Pitt’s Prisoner Fan Club,
according to Barlow, featuring
special interest programming
which is hard to find elsewhere.

In the mean time the club_ still
focuses on the worlds of comic
book collecting.

“\Y/hat draws people to comic
books is good art,” Barlow said.
“'\Y/hat keeps them there are
good stories."

Barlow, who began collecting
comic books in 1986, owns
about 3,000 books, including
about 900 Japanese and
Japanese—influenced books. I

Barlow notes the comic book
industry is past the “Archie”
phase when the big publishers
dictated what collectors could
read.

“Today comic books are
becoming specialized, so every-
one can find a comic book
which interests them,” said
Barlow.

Though most club members
do not collect exactly the same
material as the other club me1n—
bers, they can still freely discuss
the direction a comic book
series is going, a writer’s moti-

vation for a particular plot twist
and the quality of a comic
books artwork.

The club has only about 10

members but “walk-ins” often -

attend the club meetings.
Barlow said anyone is welcome
to participate in the friendly,
informal discussions of the
meetings. a

Dan Crow, business manager
of the club, is “interested in the.
conversation" at club meetings.
“Its also a good place to meet
other people who draw and
write,” he said.

“I like to see how other peo-
ple feel about comics,” club
member Larry Johnson, who
has collected comic books for
six years, said.

Johnson said club members"
opinions often differ concerning
artists, writers or characteriza-

Lockner said. “Up to this point

pledging has been focused
mostly on the social aspect of
a certain fraternity or sorority.”

Greek 101, a seminar sched-

issues such as AIDS aware-

The seminar, sponsored by

‘the IFC and Panhellenic

year to increase interest and
attendance.

“Last year Greek. 101 was
spread out over six weeks,”
Lockner said. “Many students
were too busy to attend week

after week. This year we have
compacted the program so
students can experience the
seminar in one day.”

Pitt football coach John
Majors is one of three key-
note speakers at this year’s

, seminar. -

“He will be speaking about
supporting the football
team and building up Pitt’s
image in general,” Lockner
said.

Staﬂ Writer

Members of the Bisexual, Gay

and Lesbian Alliance elected
educational directors and dis-
cussed plans for the upcoming
year at its meeting last night.
- Each year BiGALA nominates
one man and one woman to
serve as educational directors.
Nominated this year were mem-
bers Jim Dilmore and Judy
Enlon.

Co-President Todd Cable
explained the need for such
directors. “They are in charge of
of educational topics. They

' sponsor anything to educate the

heterosexual and homosexual
community. For example, Gay
on Campus,” he said.

Gay on Campus is an educa-

tional booth that will be set up .

in the William Pitt Union
Wednesday, Oct. 6.

BiGALA is also planning a
booth for National Coming Out
Week», which is the week of
October 11.

“We have two speakers for
that week, but we’re still taking
suggestions because we want to
fill the week up,  said Cable.

The group also announced an

Larry Keller, director of
Environmental Health and
Safety at Pitt, presented “Fire
Prevention Week” events to IFC
members and asked for their
support. _

“We want to reach as many
students as we can possibly
reach,” Keller said.

“The week’s activities are
intended to make students
aware of essential-fire-safety
practices.”

Keller said “Fire Prevention
Week” begins Monday, Oct.
4 and includes a showing
of Blazing Saddles with
free food and drinks Monday
night.

Events such as a poster con-
test, bucket battle and fire extin-
guisher demonstrations are
scheduled for the rest of the
week.

In other IFC business:

-Ray Pietrangeli, a local
representative of Roy Rogers,
reminded IFC members that
Roy Rogers supplies free
cups and ice to fraternity events,
provided it is formally request-

ed.

He also said chapters may
have meetings in Roy Rogers
during off hours.

OTCI of Pennsylvania, Inc.
representative Jeff Heim pre-
sented Digital Music Express
to IFC members.

He said the wide variety
of “crystal clear” quality
sounds available on DMX
can be plugged in to most fra-
ternities’ existing sound sys-
tems. '

-A motion passed to reopen
rush for the month of October
for fraternities with less than 20
members.

Only one present fraternity
was effected.

“We will follow all
rules, monitoring, etc., but

ewe need more members to

save our fraternityf’. Kappa
Sigma member Eric Kizak
said.

-Huey passed out re-
vised copies of the IFC constitu-
tion and said IFC will vote
on the proposed changes to
the existing constitution at the

Dilmore cited another

later this year.

“There is going to be a

year. It is supposed to be
bigger than the March on
Washington,” he said.

Dilmore also said there
is a need for a newsletter.

“My concern is about a
newsletter. I’m interested
in trying to do one. I’m
looking for people who
are willing to write a
movie review or a book

review,” he said.

Further future concerns
for BiGALA include

said.

“In addition, new members

New Yorker’s Wilkinson   adinire

By Julie Sabol
Editor in Chief

Although students leave col-
lege with a lack of experience,
their most unique and important
asset is enthusiasm, according
to The New Yorker writer Alec
‘Wilkinson.

“It will never be easier in
your life to pursue enthusiasm
as it is then, and that’s what
I think is inspirational,”
Wilkinson said.

Youthful enthusiasm first led
Wilkinson to work as a musi-
cian, then a police officer and
ﬁnally a writer.

Author of four books, the tal-
ented novelist is bringing his
sense of style to Pitt this
Monday as part of The New
Yor/eeris‘ continuing education
program. ,

Wilkinson’s books include
Big Sugar, winner of the Robert
F. Kennedy Book Award for
1990, which details the lives of
the West Indian men who har-
vest the sugar cane crop in
south Florida.

In his latest book, A Violent
Act, Wilkinson looks at the
crime in society with vivid
detail.

He brings the reader into the
world of a murderer, while also
exposing us to the life of the
family his heinous crime
intrudes upon.

Although the topics vary
greatly, they are tied together
in Wilkinson’s ability to com-
municate in clear, explicit de-
tail.

Detail is something Wilkinson
pays attention to in his own life
as well, especially the details of
his own happiness.

“Pleasure is extremely impor-
tant when one is young. When
you leave school
very unsettling, but it’s also
very full of possibilities 
[to] do things one expects
will be nurturing and sustaining
and not to do things out of
reasons of obligations or duty

where the energy to
keep going comes from is con-
stantly restoring it by means of
responsible pleasure,” Wil-
kinson said.

But he is not saying pleasure
is simply a carefree life.

Ac.cording to Wilkinson, any
kind of creative life involves
economic obstacles.

Some people will be
kept back by them while others

 

it’s-

will surmount. It’s the love of
what one does that allows one
to survive, according to
Wilkinson.

“An independent income
probably helps more than any-
thing else. Beyond that, [it’s] a
love of writing. If you happen
to be the sort of person who
wouldn’t»be happy doing any-
thing else, you’re sort of stuck
with being a writer. If I could
think of anything else I would
like doing better, I’d do it,”
Wilkinson said. '

Wilkinson describes his aim
in writing with one word ——
clarity.

“[1] try and make an experi-
ence available to a reader at
what I hope is first—h'and. I
would hope someone who
reads my work would feel he or
she has access both to a land-
scape and emotional terrain
which stirs them.”

Pitt Professor Lee Gutkind
says this is exactly what makes
Wilkinson such a talented
writer.

“A recognition that one could
be both incredibly accurate
and factual, while at the same
time being creative and imagi-
native and expressive  that’s

what’s really wonderful about
his work  that it’s grounded
in real journalism, yet the facts
are expressed in a vivid
and dramatic way,” Gutkind
said.

Wilkinson style is the epitome
of what Gutkind says he tries to

‘ teach his students.

“You begin with the facts of
any situation, which is the foun-
dation of any good non-fiction
writing, and then you attempt to
present these facts in a dramatic
and unique way which reflects
your own individuality,”
Gutkind said.

Pitt is a testing ground for
The New Yor/eer’s educational
program which, if successful
at Pitt, plans to send representa-
tives of the magazine to va-
rious universities across the

countiy. -
The New Yor/eer Education
Program Director Elaine

trying to reach a new and
younger audience.

students who would like to hear
what an important writer in
the 19905 has to say,” Berman
said.

Gutkind added that Wil-
kinson will not only be of inter-
est to English writing or
English Literature majors but
to students from across the
board.

The New Yor/eer is kind of a
cross—cultural magazine.-
Anyone interested in the arts,
world events, as well as good
literature, would be interested
in The New Yor/eer,” Gutkind
said.

Wilkinson said he is coming
into town with one main
goal.

“You always hope that in

an audience anywhere is some-
one to whom something you
have to say is vital and impor-
tant.” «

Senior Staff‘ Writer

American Legion halls don’t

1 _ normally go together with the

idea of underground bands. It’s
likely that a ‘legion’s regular
clientele would rather hear a
swing band and organize think
tanks on the state of the govern-
ment than to hear loud rock
music.

However, the Squirrel Hill
American Legion Hall, tucked
away behind the storefronts on
Forbes Avenue, was once a
prominent venue for bands.
From 1986 to 1988, the Legion’s
management supported one of
our country's greatest freedoms:
free enterprise. Local bands
who wanted to book their own
shows found an outlet at the
Legion.

National acts like Roger Miller

Squirrel Hill Legion

and guitarist Sylvia Juncosa’s To
Damascus also played there.
For a brief period, the Legion
even exercised a policy that
allowed over and under 21
audiences to intermingle with-
out any hassles.

But in the Summer of 1988,
the nascent Squirrel Hill under-
ground scene came to a halt
due to the Legion’s problems
over noise and alcohol laws.
Since then Pittsburgh bands
have organized several do-it-
yourself venues, but none
equalled the homegrown feel of
the Legion.

Leave it to somebody like
local promoter Manny Theiner
to bring shows back to Squirrel

Hill’s best kept secret. “I just .

went up and asked if I could
put-on a show, and they said
‘yeah,”’ Theiner .matter—of—fact1y
states. a

   

Wimp Factor 14

This Saturday locals Don

in what could be a new chapter
in the history of the Pittsburgh
music scene.

Since Don Cabellero signed
with Chicago’s Touch ‘n’ Go
Records earlier this year, the

  

band has been traveling quite a
bit. Despite its lack of a perma-
nent bassist at press time, the
Don have a single and an album
under its belt, largely a result of
recording with Steve Albini. In
addition the band has been
touring ‘extensively over the
past two months. Its Legion Hall

performance on, Saturday will
celebrate the release of its first
album For Respect.

ATS never lets out-of-town
band members keep it from
playing shows. In fact the band
has considers it a challenge.
During the Legion’s heyday,
ATS once played a show as a
duo accompanied by backing
tapes. With drummer Kip Rueﬂe
in Europe until the end of the
year, the band has called on
Water Shed drummer Jay Matula
to fill in. Matula’s jazz chops
ought to provide the band with
another musical kick to thrives
on.

In addition to continual
shows at home and in Ohio,
T hickhead Grin spent time in
the studio over the summer
recording songs for a future
release. Its fuzzed out, “psy-
chatomic” sound recently
turned up on Blue Duck
Records’ Ducle Trac/es compila-
tion CD. “Blues” features a
pounding rhythm, buzz saw
guitars and haunting vocals.
Bring your eardrums for the
band’s set on Thursday.

Wimp Factor 14 starts off the
show with primitive, heartful
strummings to make everyone
inthe audience feel warm
inside. After releasing several
lo—fi 7” singles, the band
branched out to a quintet and
hightailed it to a real recording
studio. The resulting An/ale Deep
CD, on Harriet Records, boasts a
better sound without loosing
any of the band’s appeal. The
disc’s cover keeps with the
group’s clever package credo: it
comes in a narrow manilla fold-
er rather than the typical jewel
box case.

With any luck, Saturday’s
show will be the first of many
shows to come at the Legion.
To be sure of this, be there to

support local bands and an

tion.

The Program

Directed by David S. Ward
Written by David S. Ward and
Aaron Latham

Starring James Caan and Halle
Berry

Cross an expose of the ills of
college football and the movie
White Men Can ’t_[zmzp.\‘

The result would be some-

- thing like The Program.

The movie has some-very real
looks at steroid use, Heisman
hype, recruiting violations and
student athletes who ignore the
books. To make these bitter
pills go down easier, it is all
packaged in excitinglgame
shots, some tolerable romantic
subplots, quality acting and
trash talking that hasn’t graced
the screen since Wesley Snipes

. and Woody Harrelson teamed

up on the courts.

The mix works beautifully. -

The “sugar coating” makesfor a
fun movie with a typical
Hollywood formula. In between
there are some images of the
temptations that exist for col-
lege football players and coach-
es.

Director David S. Ward (The
Sting ,Major League) teamed up

~ with Urban Cowboy writer

Aaron Latham on this script. At
the urging of producer Samuel
Goldwyn Jr., Latham spent time
with some big time college foot-
ball programs researching. The
result is an attempt to show a
realistic view of college football.

“We tried to illuminate a few
of the problems and make peo-
ple understand some of the sto-
ries behind the headlines,”
Ward said. “Obviously, some
aspects of the film are harsh.”

The most vivid of the “harsh”
scenes is those involving defen-
sive lineman Steve Lattimer
(Andrew Bryniarski). Lattimer
seems to be a relatively normal
character with a burning desire
to play football. He turns to
steroids with ugly results.

Lattimer is shown injecting
himself with the drug and
undergoing a painful-looking
method of covering his use (two
words — ouch and yuck).
There are also scary “roid rages”
as the steroids begin to bring a
violent, nasty edge to his char-
acter. -
The cast goes a long way
toward m_aking this movie
work, but it is not the headlin-
ers. James Caan is solid as head
coach Sam Winters and Halle
Berry is the same as Autumn
Haley, the tutor/love interest to
star recruit Darnell Jefferson
(Omar Epps). .

Two relative newcomers to
tire screen steal the show. Omar
Epps (Juice), as Jefferson, and
Craig Sheffer (A River Runs

5 Through It), as Heisman Trophy

candidate Joe Kane, continue to
prove they are outstanding
actors. On the other side is
Kristy Swanson who plays
Kane’s girlfriend, Camille, as
she continues to prove that 
well at least she looks good in
tight clothing.

Epps is perfect, combining
the arrogant athlete on the field
with the lost college rookie still

Craig Sheffer reacts to a play in The Program

trying to find his own way. He
also has the movie’s best scene.
Winters tells the young tailback
to carry a ball around and not
allow another player to take it
from him. You can guess the
rest, but it is great when it hap-
pens anyway.

Sheffer pulls off the complex
Kane nicely. Kane is borderline
suicidal, just waiting to screw
up like everyone else in his
family had. Winters and Camille
both try to help pull him from
the edge.

Duane Davis (Necessary
Roughness, Under Seige) plays
the athlete trying to beat the
system and the chief trash—talk-
er—as-middle-linebacker Alvin
Mack. He is the future all-pro in
his rownmi-nd, ignoring acade-
mics and just waiting for the fall.

Abraham Benrubi steals a few

football sequences himself as
the musical offensive lineman
Bud—Lite Kaminski. He has only
a few lines, but the ones he has
are good.

Strileing Distance

Directed by Rowdy Herrington
Starring Bruce Willis and Sarah
Jessica Parker

Stri/eing Distance, the long-
awaited, chrome-plated, thrill-a-
minute action picture directed
by Rowdy Herrington that con-
tains all the usual action ingre-
dients, complete with the
expected fast vehicles, sexy
guns, motives for revenge,
tough guys and the necessary
nubile woman. This movie
could easily come in a package
that says, “Freeze Dried Action

Flick, just add water and Bruce ,
"L Willis.”

It does diverge from the norm

. in one way, however. The

movie is almost as much exces-
sive family melodrama as action
ﬂick and is filled with sons wail-
ing about mother’s suicides,
family members offing family
members, and cousins betray-
ing each other. It’s as easy to
believe as a soap opera and just
about as creative.

Bruce Willis plays Tom
Hardy, a Pittsburgh cop who
turned his partner (also his
cousin) in for police brutality.
He is shunned by the rest of the
force, demoted to the River
Patrol, takes to the drink, and
after all this, has a murderer
killing all the women he’s ever
slept with and dumping them in
the river. He, of course, is trying
to solve the crime with the help
of his new partner, Jo (Sarah

Jessica Parker).

Tom Hardy is the typical,
stoic, alka—seltzer-for—breakfast
action hero. ‘He does such
incredibly mature things as
repeatedly throwing his co-
worker off his speedboat. (This
is apparently the comic relief
part of the ﬁlm.) The particular-
ly disturbing thing about his
character is that for a guy
whose high morals led him to
turn in his partner for beating
up on someone, he’s not exact-
ly gentle. In a scene that is com-
pletely unrelated to the plot of
the movie, he causes a man to
fall off a staircase onto his face
and then smashes the guy’s face
in with the butt of his shotgun.
Just the kind of hero young
males need.

Sarah Jessica Parker’s charac-
ter is yet another example of
Hollywood’s inability to have a
strong female character without
objectifying her. When Jo and
Hardy first meet, the camera
lewdly eyes her rear end as she
bends over to untie the boat. A
big deal is made of her female-
ness, as if female cops are still a
rarity, and there is some sugges-
tion that Hardy’s uncle, the
police chief, assigned her to
him just to piss him off. As
expected, Hardy and Jo end up
in bed together, and in the end
it is the same old woman—in-
jeopardy scenario. The good
and powerful male must save
the female from the clutches of

contradiction that is commercial
rebellion (rockers, actors, etc.).
As one who both reveled and
reviled in the whole “fad” con-
cept, Westerberg reveals plenty
of irony and levity in “Fad” — a
telling sidenote considering the
circumstances that so
enveloped his music life over
the past decade or so.

While upbeat volume-guz-
zlers like “Something is Me,”
“Silver Naked Ladies” and the

aforementioned duo make their ‘

mark in 14 Songs, the best of

E Mister Unkempt comes via
like

flowing strumalongs ,
“Runaway Wind,” “Things” and
“Even Here We Are” — three
comfortable yet completely
rebornsongs about realistic

‘ optimism.

Anyone can plug in a six-
string and wail incessantly
about the wrongs of society.
Westerberg makes passion and
pain peacefully believable —
both soft and hard. And he does
it with seemingly effortless orig-
inality.

“Runaway” —-- the album’s
best piece of promise —
employs Westerberg’s bellow-
ing, Neil Diamond/Bono vocals
to paint a precise portrait of
hope, while “Even” finds a
lozenge-deprived Paul waxing
wistfully about the simple beau-
ty that we often overlook. As for
“Things,” the ambiguous title
serves well the aimless-yet-sin-
cere pondering which fills this
Westerberg work.

There are hints of “tone—it-

~ down, you’re—a—solo—artist, Paul”

to 14 Songs, namely in the
mega-poppy rhythm framework
of otherwise cool tunes like
“Glimmer of Light,” “Dice
Behind Your Shades” and
“Mannequin Shop.” But as a
package of sharp singles,
Westerberg’s first ﬂight as “solo
rock artist” comes off remark-
ably smooth, considering the
album employs different musi-
cians on nearly every track.

While the extremities may be
severed, the heart and soul live
on uncompromising,
unchanged and unkempt. Just
like The Mats. '

Some things never change.
Even when they do.

PJ Harvey
Rid of Me
Island

Polly Harvey likes ‘using the element of sus-
pense in her songs. The title track of her band’s
new album starts off with Harvey’s guitar quietly
strumming one solitary chord over and over. It
continues for 45 seconds straight. The one chord
slowly getting under your skin as you wait for
something to happen. Finally, Harvey’s voice
begins singing softly: Tie yourself to me/No one
else, no/You.’re not rid of me

Although she seems calm and almost deadpan
as she delivers the lines, Harvey sounds as if she’s
about to explode.And she does. Moments later,
the band bursts into full volume with Harvey
yelling, “You’ll say don’t you wish you never,
never met her,” almost as a taunt.

Without warning, the song collapses to a low.
volume and builds to a frenzy once again.
Lyrically, Harvey paints a picture of an obsessive
house guest that won’t leave before her subject
succumbs to her desires. The song ends when the
music drops out, and Harvey sounds like she’s
gasping for air as she wails, “Lick my legs/I’m on
frre/ lick my legs/of desire.”

From the sentiment of the opening track to
“Man—Size Sextet” (which is how she feels), P]

SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY

Harvey’s second album is a rough, brittle release.
Although her frequent moaning sometimes
sounds overdone, Harvey comes across as a con-
vincing and arresting performer. Producer Steve
Albini has given the trio a stark but razor—sharp
sound. All the instruments sound dry with no
echo or reverb. The technique results in a sound
that hits right in the sternum, especially the
drums.

On first review, a lot of the songs seem to fol-
low a similar pattern: quiet riff that gets loud and
crazy during the “chorus” (if such a distinction
can be made between verses and choruses). But
repeated listenings bring out distinctions between
the two.

“Man-Size Sextet” does away with the
guitar/bass/drums instrumentation of the rest of
the album. Harvey speaks the words of the song
to the backing of an atonal, jarring string section.
The band tackles Bob Dylan’s “Highway 61
Revisited,” leaving the lyrics as the only link to
the original version. And the vocals are buried in
the mix anyway. -

Rid of Me might not be an album for the faint
of heart, but anyone looking for a female artist
that doesn’t fit comfortably into any stock music
description, be it indie rock or otherwise, should
check this out. *

Separate but unequal

Equality for all Americans, regardless of religion, race,
sex, beliefs and sexual orientation has been a topic of
public debate for a good part of the last 50 years.
Incidents have occurred which have raised the ques-
tion of what kind of society we want to live in. One that
offers the same opportunities to all, or one which
rewards some and deprives others.

Recently a situation came to light which gives some
insight into the social standing of women in this coun-
try. A female applied to The Citadel, an all—male mili-
tary school in South Carolina, and was accepted on the
basis of her academic merits. However, when the insti-
tution became aware of the fact that she was indeed a
female, it barred her entry to the academy.

Other sexually-exclusive initiations exist in our coun-
try, even in the state of Pennsylvania, but The Citadel is
unique because it is one of the two remaining all-male
military academies that is still state funded. The other
school is the Virginia Military Institute. Both institutions
are being sued fordiscrirnination against women.

Now VMI wants to settle the case by setting up a sep-
arate military program for women at another school,
and The Citadel is currently fighting the court order
which allows the woman to attend classes while courts
review its all-male policy. V

The issue is whether the schools will turn private, no
longer being eligible to receive state funding, and keep
their all—male policy. According to the Associated Press,
30 percent of The Citadel’s budget — about $12 million
— comes from public monies. Opponents to the all-
male policies are arguing that the rejection of females is
illegal. Additionally, VMI’s call to create a separate facil-
ity for women is unconstitutional. Separate but equal
was deemed unconstitutional "by the famous Supreme

' Court case of Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka,
-Kan. ' .

The Justice Department has stated that it will ﬁght any
attempt on the part of VMI to create separate but equal
facilities for women. But more importantly, VMI says its
$6.9 million dollar plan. to create these separate facili-
ties will consist of a less rigorous military program than
what is set up for the males. Christine Kellet, a law pro-
fessor at Dickinson School of Law in Carlisle, Pa., said
that this will create‘ a perception that females aren’t
capable of living up to the standards of toughness on
the part of the males.

Recent years have shown that women are just as

__ capable as men in performing military—like tasks. The
K increasing number of female officers in the United

States Armed Forces proves this.VMI and The Citadel
are state and public supported institutions. For our
courts to allow their all—male policies to continue, while
they remain state funded, would be condoning discrirn—
ination.. - .

Let’s not take a step back but a step forward and real-
ize women deserve the same opportunities as men.

Abortion is sue Will get hotter

The first College Republicans
meeting of the year included a
very telling moment.

Tom Smith, the head of
Republican public relations for
Pennsylvania, essentially argued
that the party’s stance on abor-
tion is too strict, and that it
ought to be loosened. He point-
ed to the rift that this issue
caused as a key factor in the
defeat of George Bush. C

Needless to say, some of the
CRs disagreed. In fact, Jeff
Paladino, the head of Pitt’s
Students for Life felt that
Abraham Lincoln, the founder
of the Republican party, would
be horrified if he heard this sug-
gestion. V

After all, Paladino pointed
out, issues of morality are the
foundation upon which Lincoln
founded that party.

Mr. Smith was wrong when
he saidthat the abortion issue
cost the Republicans the presi-
dency. Any differences that
members of the GOP had over
the issue of abortion took a
back seat to other issues that
almost all Republicanspagree
upon (such as the role of gov-
ernment in the economy). If the
economy had been in better
shape at this point a year ago,
George Bush would still occupy
the White House.

However, his warning is still
relevant.

There are a number of viable
pro—choice, Republican candi-
dates that will be hurt by tight-
ing within their party (e.g. GOP
gubernatorial candidate Tom
Ridge).

In their zeal to push their
agenda, many Republicans '
could very well end up cutting
off their own nose to spite their
face. This is hardly a formula for
political success.

On the other hand, Jeff
Paladino’s argument that a pro-
choice stance is some ‘sort of
betrayal of the ideals upon
which the GOP was founded
isn’t entirely accurate.

Lincoln wasn’t as righteous 2!»
we have made him out to be.

ask

While he was an abolitionist, he
put the preservation of the
Union above the issue of slav-
ery. »

If he could have reunifred the
North and South at the expense
of abolition, he would have
done it. The Emancipation
Proclamation was passed out of
practical necessity, not out of

any great urge to do the right

McClearn

thing. For Mr. Paladino to point
to Lincoln’s actions as proof for
the Republican party’s moral
underpinnings is a fallacious
argument. To claim that the
Republican party was founded
on some purely moral impera-
tive is simply wrong.

.This is not to say that the
position that pro—life
Republicans take is necessarily
wrong. .

Their opposition to abortion
is (hopefully) principled and
sincere. To dismiss such a
group on the grounds that the
issue that they are fighting for is
not worth the effort is politically
foolish.

The pro—life movement is not
going to go away. As much as
Tom Smith may want to, he,
and others who share his views,
‘simply cannot “bury the issue.”
It refuses to die. _

This is one issue that must be
dealt with sooner or later. As
messy or as painful as it may be,
the debate is going to continue.

In spite of what each party’s
platform says, the issue of abor-
tion is not strictly divided along
partisan lines.

The state of Pennsylvania is
perfect example of what I
mean.

On most issues, Governor
Casey falls into the liberal wing
of the Democratic party. And

‘yet, he_is ardently pro—life. Ar_len

Specter, on the other hand, is a

three—term Republican senator
who is solidly pro—choice.
Others, such as Rep. Ron Klink
(a pro-life Democrat) and state

‘Auditor-General Barbara Hafer

(a pro—choice Republican) are
two other prominent politicians
who exemplify this phenome-
non.

Tom Smith’s views caused a
stir at the CR meeting because
of the fact that their is more
than one view on that issue
within the party. i‘

Over the next few years, the’:
controversy surrounding the :
abortion issue will only intensi-I
fy.
The introduction of RU-48%
(also known as the “morning
after pill”) will enable doctors to
offer patients a cheaper, safer
form of abortion. The combina-
tion of low costs and high priva-
cy will make the issue even
more personal for even more
people. '

At the same time, those who
oppose abortion will only seek
to redouble their efforts in the
face of this momentous change.
Both parties will face some very
tough decisions.

Partisans from all sides will be
pestering the national, state and
local committees of their parties
to take an even stronger stance
on this issue.

As much as both parties
would like to sweep the whole
affair under the rug, the cur-
rents of social change will force
them to confront the issue out
in the open. The coming
debates may be painful and
unpleasant, but it’s unavoid-
-able.

The first CR meeting provided
just a taste of what’s to come. I
wish I could tell you more, but
I’m not entirely sure what’s
going to happen myself.

The only thing I can ‘leave
you with is a piece of advice:
“Hang on to your hats kids.

‘cause it's gonna be one hell of

a bumpy ride!"

Many people think that the
problem of violent crime in
the United States can be
solved through anti—gun legis,-.

’ ‘lation. This notion is obvious-'

ly false.
. Firearms and ammunition
are greatly restricted in

Washington, D.C. yet, the city

continues to have one of the
highest murder rates in the
.1 country.

Assault "rifles such as the
AK—47 and the M—16 have
come‘ under recent scrutiny.
Recent hearings in Congress
would have you believe that
assault rifles are a huge soci-

, etal problem. However,
, according to the crime statis-
tics of the Federal Bureau of

l  Anti-gun legislation will

Investigation, less than 1 per-
cent of crimes committed with
a firearm involves any sort of
assaulttweapon.

Another problem with ban-
ning assault weapons is the

issue of defining what exactly

is an “assault” rifle. Bills intro-
duced into Congresslhave
defined assault weapons as
any semiautomatic weapon.
There are many rifles and
shotguns on the marketlthat
are semiautomatic and bear
no resemblance to any mili-
tary-style weapons. Many
times in Congressional hear-
ings, the issue of banning the
weapons in question actually
revolves around how intimi-
dating the weapon looks.

Another argument used by
many (including our presi-
dent) is that military-style
weapons have no practical

purposes. The truth is that in
many states, as long as the
size of the magazine is limited
to five rounds, hunting with
assault rifles is legal.

accurate and make for very
enjoyable target shooting.
Certain types of assault
weapons make excellent
home defense weapons
because they provide the gun
owner with superior firepow-

er, yet assault rifles are totally

useless for most criminals.

Could you imagine a burglar »

breaking into your home car-
rying an AK-47?

Even if a gunsmith was to
convert your‘ weapon to a
semi—automatic one, there
would be next to nowhere to
shoot your weapons. Public
ranges won’t allowfully-auto-
matic weapons, and most pri-
vate ranges would want to see
permits.

It“would be unwise to allow
media bias and a minority of
people to take away your
Second Amendment rights.
The National Riﬂe Association
alone has more than 3.1 mil-
lion members, while the
largest anti—gun group has
only 600,000 members. Allow
gun—control referendums to be
voted on by the populace. Il
the majority of Americans
really feel that assault rifles
present a real danger to the

ly give mine up. But until that
happens, I will keep my
assault rifle right where it is

Economy woala’ henefit if trade barriers with Vietnam Zzftea’

V While the Clinton administra-
tion is wringing its hands over
what to do" with Vietnam, many
of the world's other major eco-
nomic’ superpowers have

already decided. T hey’re invest- '

ing in Vietnam, and the reason
is simple — the Vietnamese
economy is booming as the
‘combination of a developed
national capital and a hard-
“ working, cheap-labor force is
driving an economic revival. \
In 1986 the Communist gov-
ernment in Hanoi saw the writ-
— ing on the wall and decided to
allow the southern city of Ho
Chi Minh City (Saigon) try its
hand in free market reforms.

city has only 7lpercent of the
nation’s population but
accounts for nearly one—third of
Vietnam’s industrial production»
(Newswee/2, April 12, 1993).
There are over 600 new firms
that make clothing and other
products for export.

Japan, Taiwan,»South Korea
and the European Community
have already invested over $5
billion in the development of
Vietnam’s industrial base
(Newsweele, April 26, 1993),
and more foreign investment is
flooding in bythe month. . It
appears that there are only two

I roadblocks to the U.S. nonnaliz—
ing relations with Vietnam. The

first is the 2,000 or so unac-

Vietnam War. There is not one
shred of evidence to even sug-
gest, let alone prove, that there

governmental policy with
Vietnam is being held captive
by a small, radical wing of the
MIA movement that has
absolutely no evidence and is
still living in the past. The

Vietnamese government has

The second roadblock in the
way of normalized relations is
the U.S. governments’ insis-
tence of attaching “human
rights” conditions to trade rela-
tions. The State Department’s
annual “human rights” report

cited “severe restrictions on.

freedom of speech, press,
assembly and association on
worker rights, and the right of
citizens to change their govern-
ment” (The Baltimore Sun, July
25, 1993). It is absurd for the
U.S. to make foreign policy
decisions by looking at other
nations’ “human rights” records.
The U.S. government had better
take a look at the crime rate in
this country before pointing fin-

people treated with respect and
dignity, but one must be careful
not to bully and judge other
nations because those tactics
just don’t work. '

Our government allows petty
politics and special interest
groups to distort the realities of
the world in which we live and

must be able tojcompete in for '

our economic survival. Their
policies hurt U.S. businesses
and the American people. Let’s
get past the Vietnam War syn-
drome and lift the trade embar-

r Seeking racism  
Lea Griggs, a first-year stu-
dentat‘ Pitt, has decided that
racism is running rampant on
this campus based on one ele-
E vator ride. What better experi-
ence can one have to base this
assumption on? Let’s look at the
facts."
First, she had a quiet elevator
ride with a bunch of strangers. I
know on several occasions I’ve
struck up meaningful conversa-
tions on the Tower A elevator
with total strangers. Second,
they had the audacity to step
aside and let her on as if they
would “be contaminated” by

squeeze between them? That
too would have been construed
as a racial act. In Wehsters New
World Dictionary paranoia is
defined as, “a psychosis
marked by delusions of perse-
cution or of. grandeur.” I’m not
sure but feeling stares may
qualify as paranoia. If not, she
should do something with this
great gift (perhaps putting Pitt
on the map for its psychologi-
cal findings in ESP). By the way
.Lea, who do you FEEL will win

yourself as a “queen.” The rest

Make labs more available to students

I am writing to voice my disap-
proval regarding the services provid-
ed by this university. I was amazed

_ to discover that after commuting

here from off-campus on a Friday
night for the purpose of using the
computers, the labs were all closed.
It seems to me that for as much as
students pay in computer fees, the
labs should be open 24 hours, seven

During the week, I, like most stu-
dents, have classes during the day
and work in the afternoons and
evenings. This does not leave a
whole lot of time for computer time,

days a week. F -

so it usually waits until the weekend
when I at least don’t have to go to
class. But it seems that the person
who made the decision to close the
labs for much of the available (to
me) working time values partying
more than working. Believe it or not,
some students are actually here to do

some work not just toss back a few

cold ones at the “O” on a Friday
night. The labs need to be open as
much as possible for the students
who need them.

BAS attitude only makes struggle harder

Recent comments made by mem-
bers of the Black Action Society beg
reply from someone of the white
“community.”

Flyers announcing a BAS meeting

’ and Annastasia Faith’s recent letter

allude to “forces of evil” uniting
against the “African community.” The
ﬂyer mentions forming a unity that
the “Devil” cannot infiltrate. This evil,
this devil, represents the white com-

‘munity. I resent this thinly-veiled
"racism. *

Oscar Eybers defended the closed-
door BAS meeting, remarking, “Our
ancestors had no privacy ...” Faith
outrageously claims “white people,
on the whole, have historically
accepted  slaves.” Blacks will never
gain respect and equality if black
groups continue to pin this scarlet S
on the chests of white America.

The.BAS supports an African-

American cultural center, slapping-

t.he faces of other minorities by rele-
gating their displays to “temporary”
status. White (European) cultural dis-
plays are not mentioned. Should the
white Pitt community then build a
separate home for its “family?” Of
course not. That would be racist.
Why not build, a center devoted to
the cultures of a_ll campus residents?

Our university community needs to
recognize that the prejudice and divi-
sion preached by certain BAS mem-
bers is self-destructive. Secrecy, hate-
mongering and exclusion have no
place in an academic setting and fos-
ter only resentment, misunderstand-
ing, fear and the very racism BAS
attempts to fight.

Scientifically inferior

I. am writing to you in response to the arti-
cle written in The Pitt News on Sept. 27, 1993
(“Pitt’s Involvement  Some of the quotes
that I read in the paper confused me. For
example, David Turnshek, formerly on the
payroll at the University of Arizona, is now a
professor at Pitt promoting the Mt. Graham
Telescope Project to Pitt’s administration.
Tumshek stated in The Pitt News that the
“university is going slow and lookinglat all
the issues” in relation to the project. Dr.
Tumshek overlooked many crucial issues
when he rushed the proposal through the
astronomy department directly onto the
chancellor’s desk.

Some of the crucial facts that Dr. Tumshek
has conveniently overlooked are: 1) There
are no other U.S. partners involved with this
project even though well over 30 have been
involved. All have dropped out, including Cal
Tech, the National Optical Astronomer’s
Observatories, Ohio State University, Harvard
University, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and many other presti-
gious institutions; 2) The NOAO, a consor-
tium of 22 universities and institutions who
make up the leaders in the astronomy field,
have said that there are 37 other sites in the
continental United States that are scientiﬁcal-
ly superior to Mt. Graham; and 3) The UA’s
own astronomers have admitted that there
were serious enough miscalculations to war-

rnile away from their original site. This mis-
calculation has delayed the Columbus Project
(the telescope that Pitt might be paying for)
for a year and is under federal investigation.

As a Pitt student and an avid amateur
astronomer, I would not want to see my uni-
versity waste its money on a project that is so
scientiﬁcally ﬂawed.

“It"s mine, it’s mine,” one
would yell. “No, it’s mine, it’s
mine,” the other would scream
back: ~
While this little scuffle seems
to have no relevance to Pitt
football, Panther quarterback
coach Ken Karcher thinks it
does.

“We need a guy who is play-
ing consistentjf Karcher said of

Pitt's quarterback situation. “We '

need a guy to step’ up and take
the job. ‘

“Someone who will say, ‘If—I
play well, it’s me. And you’re
not getting in there,” he said.

Enter redshirt sophomores
John Ryan and Ken Ferguson.

Panthers — Ryan"s two games
edging Ferguson’s one — and
both have played, well, sporad-
ically. Both even root for each
other.

“If John is in there, I’ll root
for him,” Ferguson said. A

The feeling is mutual.

“I don’t have anything against
Ken. I was glad he got the start
ltwo weeks ago against Ohio

Statel,” Ryan said.

Both, of course, are good
friends and are more con-
cerned about Pitt doing well
than themselves.

But as the position demands,
_both Ryan and Ferguson are
quarterbacksgand both must
show leadership through their
play.

“If I make a mistake, I don’t
think they will hesitate to pull
me,” Ryan, Pitt’s starter for this
week’s Louisville game, said.

Not so fast though.

“I don’t think we pulled any
one of them before half,”
Karcher said. f‘We pulled them
when-we -felt they were not
moving the ball and we needed
a spark.”

The needed spark Karcher
spoke of came against Ohio
State two weeks ago.

Ryan, subbing for Ferguson,
hit four second—half touchdown
passes that gave him the start-
ing nod for Louisville.

But even Ryan doesn’t count
that as too important. i

“There was no pressure
whatsoever against Ohio State
because of the score,” Ryan
said.

However, it was that perfor-
mance that impressed Karcher.
A performance, Karcher thinks,
is one way of solidifying the

want one of them to come to
the front,” Karcher said. “After
all, we are not looking to pull a
guy, we are looking to keep a
guy in there.”

So where does that leave
first-year quarterback. Pete

quarterback if Ryan and

take it"

Ferguson can’t get the offense
in gear?

“Pete could play this week,
or he may not play this year,”

.Karcher said. “He is a typical

freshman, and he needs work.”
That leaves only Ryan and
Ferguson to do battle the
remainder of the season.
“I just want to do what the

coachesfeel is better for us to '

win ball games,” Ferguson said.
“I’l1 do my best if I get the
chance.”

This Saturday it will be Ryan
who gets the first chance to
show his stuff.

“The coaches tell me to go
out there and do what they ask
me to do,” Ryan said.

And, according to Karcher,
that his move the offense and
take command of the team.

So far, with the exception of
the Southern Mississippi game,
neither quarterback has done
exactly that. 

Will Ryan change his fortune
against Louisville? What hap-
pens if he doesn’t?

“I always expect to go in,”
Ferguson said ofnhis mentality
when not starting. “If you don’t
expect it, you are not pre-
pared.”

Or you’re not willing to take
charge of this young Pitt team.

When wishing someone
good luck in the theater indus-
try, one might say “break a
leg.” This is precisely what
happened the last time Pitt
head coach Johnny Majors
faced the Louisville Cardinals
and starting quarterback Jeff
Brohm (rhymes with prom).

If we go back two seasons,
we see Majors, head coach at
Tennessee at the time, and
Brohm, starting quarterback for
the Cardinals back then.

It was the second gameof
the season for Louisville. It was
coming off a win against
Eastern Kentucky, and at that
time, felt it could match up
with Tennessee. '

, Jeff Brohm remembers that
painful day well. '

“It was a very pivotal game
for both programs,” Brohm
said. “We had nothing to lose
and everything to gain. We
were ‘able to play them tough
most of the game.

 

Louisville ﬁth-year senior quarterback Jeff Brohm.

“We had first—and-one at the
one to begin the fourth quarter.
I was turning, my foot got

caught in the turf, and I got hit, ‘~

breaking my leg.” _
Majors remembers that event-
ful day as well.

otent ouisville attack

and is now a heavily—experi—
enced, fifth—year ‘senior return-
ing to face Johnny Majors once
again. —

He took every snap in the
1992 Cardinals’ season. He was
selected last year’s team MVP
by the Cardinal coaches and
was also selected this year’s
team captain.

“I like things pretty much the
way they’re run here right now.
I feel very comfortable with the
offensive schemes, and the
keys to the offensepare not
hard for me to accomplish,”
Brohm said.

Coach Schnellenberger feels
just as comfortable coming into
Saturday’s game with Jeff
Brohm at the helm.

“We feel quite comfortable
coming into this year’s game [at
Pitt] with Jeff Brohm our red-
shirt senior at quarterback.
From the second half of last
yegr through this year so far,
Jeff has really come into his
own.

“Jeff really knows how to
handle the offense. He’s able to
get out on the corners when he
has to. He has great escapabili-
ty. He can direct our team and
does well,” Schnellenberge
said. ‘

Brohm was heavily recruited
out of high school as one of
the most heralded high school
quarterbacks to ever come out
of the state of Kentucky.
Among the interested schools
were Notre Dame, University of
Southern California, Boston
College, Kentucky and
Vanderbilt. However, the
hometown boy from Louisville
had no problem choosing the
school down the street when
he took into consideration
Coach Schnellenberger’s lega-
cy.

This proves how
Schnellenberger’s reputation
preceded itself, because when
Brohm was asked if he fol-
lowed Coach Schnellenberger
at Miami, he replied_, “No, not

really.” Brohm also never men-.

tioned the fact that his dad was
a quarterback at Louisville from
1968-1969 as being a factor in
his decision on playing football
at Louisville.

“I picked Louisville because
of Coach Schnellenberger and
his reputation for developing
quarterbacks into pro
prospects.

"I love playing for Coach
Schnellenberger, and his pres-
ence here weighed my decision
very heavily. It was not a tough
decision for me to pick
Louisville,” Brohm said.

It was alsonot a tough deci-
sion for Louisville to pick
Brohm to run its offense, as his
size, speed and attributes fit the
Louisville scheme like a glove.
Brohm is six—feet, one-inch, 200
pounds and has enough speed
to run and scramble when he
has to, but more importantly,
he has an accurate arm and is
able to throw both set and on
the move.

“lBrohm] throws well both in

the pocket and scrambling. -I
don’t know him personally, but

:he’s an outstanding lea.der by
' all standards,” Majors said.

‘Pant/oers beaz/y favorites to retain Big East crown

Pitt volleyball
again the class
of conference,-
Proviaence a
distant secona’

~ By Ryan Buncher
E Senior Staff Writer

The players and coaches
have changed, but the results
are still the same. The Pitt vol-
leyball team (8-4 overall) is still
the class of Big East volleyball.
The conference coaches picked
the Panthers to win their sixth
straight Big East title.

“I expect to go undefeated in

the Big East,” Pitt head coach

Cindy Braziel said in presea-
son.

The Panthers established
themselves early last Friday by
dispatching Syracuse in three
games ——- their only official Big
East match so far this season.

Pitt set higher goals, almost
looking past the conference to

success on the national level.
Assistant coach Brian Begor
pointed out that those aspira-
tions make the Big East match-
es even more important.

“The Big East is our entry
into the NCAA Tournament,”
Begor said.

“If you beat [a top teaml_ and
have a decent season, but lose
the Big East tournament, you’re
not going to the NCAA
Tournament.”

Two—time conference MVP
Ann Marie Lucanie leads a
Panthers’ team that did not lose
a player to graduation from last
season.

It has not had middle hitter
Alyssia Yanik, a starter last
year, due to injury, butwit has
been bolstered by redshirt first-
year player Jennie Driscoll,
who has stepped in at the mid-
dle position.

The Panthers face a key
weekend in the race for the
regular season conference title
this weekend as they visit

Seton Hall, Providence and _

Connecticut.

of two teams (Villanova was
the other) to beat the Panthers
last season.

“Providence is an interesting
team  they do a lot of things
well that we don’t enjoy teams
doing well against us,” Begor

said. “The ball just keeps com-
ing up. It forces you to do
things you’re not comfortable
doing.”

The Friars are 10-6 so far this
season, only 2-2 since senior
outside hitter Missy Dawson
went out of the lineup with 21
severe ankle sprain.

Junior middle hitter Aileen
Koprowski was an all—confer—
ence selection last year and
leads the conference with 4.46
digs per game. Sophomore
Jocelyn Cole has been the top
attacker so far this season with
121 kills.

3. Seton Hall (35): The
Pirates return five starters from

12-5  

a team that tied for the regular
season conference title last
year. The team jumped out to a
9-2 start behind solid attacking.

“\X/e’re playing good ball,”
Seton Hall head coach
Stephanie Hoenig said. “Our
strength has always been
offense, and I think it will con-
tinue to be our offense.”

Junior middle blocker Parette
Arrington leads.Big East players
in hitting with '-.1 .453 percent-
age on 132 kills, just ahead of
Lucanie (.574). Senior middle
blocker Andrea Kasper is third
with a .358.

The Pirates have also piled

This Saturday is the biggest
game of the year for Pitt
rugby. The 2-0 Panthers will
face undefeated West Virginia.
The game has playoff implica-
tions for both teams.

If the Mountaineers win, they

I will clinch the Allegheny Rugby "

Union’s “B” division title. If the
Panthers win, they will secure
at least a tie for the division
title.

‘Last year WVU defeated Pitt

' 7-5 in the first game of the sea-

son at Morgantown. The differ-
ence in the game was a missed

extra point.

Saturday’s game is the
Mountaineers’ final game of the
season. The president of WVU’s
rugby club, Brian Hockman,
said that ‘lthey haven’t been
challenged yet.” He also added
that ‘‘they’ve been looking for-
ward to this game since the
beginning of the season.”

Pitt senior Eoin Beck said the
Panthers have a better team
this year.. “We are a lot
stronger,”, he said. “Last year

we might have been a little-

intimidated, but I’m sure that

won’t be a problem Saturday.”
Adam Brennan described the

game as a “must—win” situation.

  BIT-Sugby battles    Saturd y

“WVU has a great team,” he
added. “They’re confident but
so are we. I expect a tough,
physical game. We had very
intense practices this week, and
there’s no doubt in my mind
that the guys will be ready to
play.”

Brennan also said that “a
good crowd” will help the team
immensely. “Come to the rugby

game in the afternoon and then .

go to the football game that

night,” he said.

RUGBY NOTES: Brennan,
out with a knee injury, will be
replaced by Ed Kisack. Junior
Tim Gray will return to action
after missing last week’s game.

THE PI'IT NEWS, PREGAME, Thursday, Segteniber 30, 1993

Tennis tops St. Francis

By Dan Lauso
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s tennis
team evened its record to
three wins and three losses
with a 4-3 victory over the
Red Flash of St. Francis at
the Cost Center yesterday.

The match was delayed
two hours because the team
from St. Francis was late in
arriving.

The long wait didn’t seem
to bother the Panthers as
they came out strong in the
doubles — winning two of
the three matches.

Due to the late starting
time, doubles matches were
played under a pro set.
Under a pro set, the first
team to win eight games in
a set wins instead of the
usual best two-out-of-three
format.

The top-seeded team of
Alison Baker and Marla
Zielinski won the opening

doubles match of the after-
noon by a score of 8-6.

Kristen Siegel and her
teammate Deborah Baird
clinched the doubles portion
of the match by defeating
their opponents 8-4.

The Panthers’ No. 2 seed-
ed team of Bard McCarthy
and Tammy Keijter played
well but lost in their match
by a score of 2-8.

Pitt’s team was dealt a
tough blow when No. 4
seed Keijter had to leave the
contest in order to take a
test in one of her classes.

Kristen Siegel, Becky
Elliott and Hillary Gordon all
had to move up a spot in
order to fill the void left by
Keijter.

Elliott, playing in the No.
5 spot, responded with a
"strong effort by easily win-
ning her match with the

score 6-1, 6-5. ‘

Yellow cards ﬂy
as Pitt soccer
wins its third
straight game.

Byjack Becker
Staff Writer

LORETTO, PA. — Out from
amidst the grey skies and rain-
soaked field emerged one man,
Jeff Porter, behind the St.
Francis defense with a loose
ball and an open net. Porter
put the two together and gave
Pitt a 2-1 overtime win over the
Red Flash yesterday.

Porter did not cry out in vic-
tory nor did he even show
much emotion. He simply

‘turned around and walked

away. The Panthers and head
coach Joe Luxbacher just want-
ed to get out of town while the
gettin’ was good.

And take their win with
them.

“If I was [Luxbacher], I’d be
happy to get out of here with
the win,” St. Francis Coach Bill
Furjanic said. A

Happy indeed. In between
the frequent downpours of rain
was an extremely physical con-
test which was overloaded with
four yellow cards.

St, Francis, which did not
substitute the entire game, took
it to the Panthers from the out-

  TI-TIE PITI' ‘NEWS, PREGAME, Thursday, Sentember 30, 1993 _

Larorny goal seals OT socc

set.

“We scared them,” Furjanic
said.

Pitt may have gotten a scare
at the thought of losing but cer-
tainly didn’t back down to St.
Francis on the field.

Pitt jumped out in front at 40
minutes and 26 seconds of the
first half when the team capital-
ized on what tumed out to be
the most beautiful play of the
day.

Senior Walt Lamory connect-
ed on a sliding shot off a sen-
sational feed from Pitt leading-
scorer Eric Duffy.

The play resulted from a St.
Francis penalty deep in the
home teams -territory.

The Red Flash formed a six-
man wall in front of the
Panthers’ direct kick. After
some talk amongst the Pitt
players as to who exactly
would take the kick, Lamory
charged the ball from the left
side as if he were going to
shoot but instead passed it by.

Ted Noethling did the same
from the right side of the ball.
This maneuver seemed to .con-
fuse the defense and then, at
just the proper instant, Duffy
attacked the ball down the cen-
t€1‘.

Duffy faked a shot at the six-
man wall and instead left a per-
fect pass for Lamory who put it
past goalie Dave Godfrey.

The goal gave Pitt a 1-0 lead,
and it even drew some admira-

tion from the St. Francis bench
who accidentally said “nice
play” out from under its collec-
tive breath.

Two minutes later, St. Francis
answered Pitt’s goal with one
of its own.

Tyler Hauck, a transfer from
Lock Haven, deposited a ball
into the net that Pitt goalie Kirk
Brodows was unable to reach
for a 1-1 tie going into halftime.
It was one of only a few
Brodows’ mistakes all after-
noon.

At 53:19 of the second half
the yellow cards began to fly.

The first was on Mike Bacasa, '

who was called for running
into the goalie.

Dean Astorino picked up a
yellow card seven minutes later
for throwing a defender to the
ground.

“You don’t want to get into a
wide open game with them,
and that is exactly what hap-
pened,” Luxbacher said.

“lThe game] Was back and
forth. That’s not our style of
play-”

Pitt had one last shot at leav-
ing Loretto at the end of regu-
lation.

However, the Panthers tried
the exact same play they
scored on in the first half. This
time Duffy took the shot, and it
sailed just inches over the
crossbar.

In overtime St. Francis hoard-
ed the ball in the Panthers’ end

and threw the scare into Pitt
that Furjanic spoke of.

St. Francis forward Chris
Buysee lifted a pass over Pitt’s
Charlie Wasson and to a streak-
ing Ian Brigss.

But Brodows beat.Brigss to
the ball, barely knocking it
away and collecting a nice-
sized bruise on his forehead in
the process.

Brodows made another
important save a few minutes
later when he beat out Brigss
to the ball a second time off a
corner kick.

“That is the weak pait of my
game. I wasn’t going to let
[Brigss] do it,” Brodows said. “If

P-9

er win over St. Francis

you take [the ball] off the cross,
then you don’t get the headers
on you.”

That was St. Francis’ last
chance because Porter stuck in
the game winner at 10:24 of the
overtime period.

“It’s a good win,” Luxbacher
said.

“We won without playing as
well as we are capable.”

“Joe [Luxbacher] does a good
job,” Furjanic said. “He gets all
the Pittsburgh kids, and they’re
tough as nails.”

On this day, they needed to
be.

up the aces with three of the

top four in the conference (set-
ter Casie Alexander, sopho- —

more middle blocker Silvia
Watson and rookie Malte
Tristin-Martin).

‘The number of players‘ with
good numbers is an indication
of another Pirate strength.

“Everyone is contributing,”
Hoenig said. “That is something
we really haven’t had in the
past. [We have]- much better
depth. A lot more maturity and
experience as well, but the
depth is the key this year for
us.’

4. Syracuse (29): Two years
ago, Syracuse was the number-
two team in the conference,
playing Pitt in the tournament
championship game for the
second straight season. Last
year the Orange slipped a bit,
and this year the fall is com-
plete. ,

Syracuse has stumbled out of
the gate to the tune of a 3-10
record, including the disman-
tling by Pitt.

Junior middle blocker Angie
Casazza is one of the top
attackers with 126 kills in addi-
tion to 50 total blocks (eight
solos, 22 assists). Two rookies

5. Connecticut (25): The
Huskies have compiled the best
record entering Big East play
with an 11-2 mark, including a
five-game win over Providence
in what was officially a non-
conference match.

Junior outside hitter Erika.

Hanson was the most recent
Big East Player of the Week.
Middle blocker Kim Lobach,
the lone senior on the team, is
fourth in the conference in hit-
ting. ' g

Two rookies, outside hitters
Jennifer Halusek and Heather
Sokol, have stepped into start-
ing spots. Halusek anchors a
defense that is sixth in-the
nation in digs with 4.213 per
game. .

6. Georgetown (20): The
Hoyas have tripped up almost
as badly as Syracuse so far
going 4-10.

As with Syracuse, youth is a
major factor. Six of the 10 play-
ers on the Georgetown
University roster are rookies,
and outside hitter Lija Austins is
the only senior.iAustins has
done very little so far, and one
of the rookies, five-foot—nine-
inch hitter Meghan O’Rourke
leads the team in kills (2.5 per
game) and digs (3.1 per game).

7. Villanova (16): The
Wildcats lost two all—conference

selections in Vicky Dispenza _

and Pam Clifford. After a slow
start, they enter conference
play on a seven-match winning
streak. Senior middle hitter
Becky Kulbago is. fifth in the
conference in hitting and was

the Big East Player of the Week .

Tony Fiorini/The Pitt News

Pitt is favored towin its sixth straight league title.

for Sept. 9.

8. Boston College (8): The
Eagles return three starters but
employ a roster dominated by
rookies and sophomores. One
of the kids, rookie outside hit-
ter Deanna Herman, is the
team’s top attacker (117 kills)
and defensive player (97 digs).
Boston College is 4-7 so far and
will have a hard time emerging
fromits recent tradition of liv-
ing in the cellar of the Big East
Conference. ’

Conference Outlook:

Providence, Seton Hall and
Connecticut are the best of a
weak group to challenge Pitt’s
stranglehold on the conference
title. Begor /outlined why Pitt
should remain on top.

“Because of the support
we’ve had  from the adminis-
tration, I’m not sure any other
club is in a position to be able
to compete with us,” Begor
said. "I'm not sure it’s possible
for teams [in the Big East vol-
leyball conference] to narrow
the gap.”

showed no signs of nervous-
ness and played likea champi-

‘ on, rolling over her opponent

in straight sets by the score 6-1,
6-0.

The most exciting match of
the afternoon was played by
the Panthers’ Marla Zielinski.
Zielinski clinched the victory
for Pitt by defeating Peg
Pawlowski of St. Francis 6-2, 7-
6.

A Zielinski controlled the
tempo of the match throughout
the entire game. With quick
feet, powerful forehands and
an attacking style of play at the

, net, Zielinski strengthened her

position as one of the corner-
stones of this team for the
future, ,

Pitt’s top—seed Alison Baker
had a tough afternoon, losing
in straight sets to Kristi Liebay
of St. Francis by the score 4-6,
5-6.

Kristen Siegel was involved
in the afternoon’s longest
match, losing a heaitbreaker in
three sets.

’ Siegel made a strong come-
back in the second set but ran
out of steam in the third set
losing 3-6, 7-6, and 3-6. _

“We played some good dou-
bles and two tough matches at
the five and six [seedsl,” Pitt
head coach George
Dieffenbach said.

“We lost our No. 4 seed
Tammy [Keijterl in the singles
matches, and we still came
back hard to win.”

Coach Dieffenbach is
extremely happy with his teams _
.500 record at this point in the
season. _

“This is a rebuilding year,” he
said. “We lost a lot of players
last year and I’m real pleased
with the team so far this sea-
son.” _ ’

Next up for the Panthers is a
trip Monday Oct. 4 at Carnegie
Mellon

The women's team returns to
the Cost Center October 5th to
battle inner-city rival Robert.
Morris.

Game time next Tuesday is
3:30 pm.

 

California of Pennsylvania
invades the Cost Center
October 6th for a 5 pm
matchup.

-The Pitt men’s tennis team
rolled over St. Francis yester-
day, winning 7-0.

The onslaught started in the
singles match with the Pitt men
easily winning all matches.

St. Francis was never allowed
toiget anything because it lost
every set and every game
except one. The carnage con-
tinued even into the doubles
matches.

Pitt made quick work of St.
Francis, winning all three
matches and dropping only
two games in the process.

The victory yesterday at the
Cost Center upped the Panthers
season record to a perfect 3-0
on the fall season.

The men's squad is off until
October 13th, that's when
Youngstown State University
visits the Cost Center for a 5
pm affair.

After that, Pitt hits the road
for five straight events.

' banged up at several key

positions.

“It’s very hard to compen-
sate [for the lack of speedl,”
Dreisbach said.

“What we will try to do is
we’ll try to move around a
little more than what we’ve
done [in the past], so per-

haps they won’t know

where we are.
The problem there is that
our players are so young

that it’s hard to get them to

know where they’re sup-

1 posed to be to begin with,

let alone now. We’ve got
some problems there,"
Dreisbach said.

“I think that one of the

keys for us is to play as hard
as possible,” Pitt sophomore
safety _David Sumner said.

-“Right now we’re probably

missing too many assign-
ments, and we have to do
more of what we’re taught,
and I think that will be
some of the things to focus
on.”

Louisville runs out Jaime
Asher, a six—foot-three-inch
junior at the tight end posi-
tion. Asher leads the
Cardinals in receiving, catch-
ing 19 passes for 213_ yards
— an 11.2—yards per catch
average.

Chris Fitzpatrick plays full-
back while Aaron Bailey will
