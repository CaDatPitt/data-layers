Legal Awareness
CommitteeHelps
Discipline Cases

by PAUL STOLLER, Editor

..Student groups at the Univer-
sity have never really been auton-
omous units in any way shape of
form. Even Student Government
(SG) President Ken Schueler ad-
mits that the sharp criticism of SG
as being a “do nothing" organi-
zation that lacks autonomy is
quite valid. But Schueler believes
that things are going to change.

Schueler is now organizing a
new committee that will insure
student rights. The new group
will be known as the Legal Aware-
ness Committee. and will be
modeled after a similar commit-
tee at Penn State.

Vice-Chancellor Tells
Uni<versity’s Plan For

AnticipateclDormitories

by EARLE JACOBS

Thd University’s first prefer-
ence for future dormitories is the
hillside above the engineering
buildings. The Pitt News learned
this is a recent interview with
Edison Montgomery. vice chan-
cellor of finance.

Mr. Montgomery said that the
original plans for dormitories
near the Trees Field area fell
through because of legal diffi-
culties encountered during plans
to move graves from the Oakland
Cemetery. At the present time.
three basic plans for housing are
being given serious considera-
tion.

Thd University’s first choice
for housing is the hillside above
the engineering complex. Access
to these dormitories would be a
major problem. so the architects
are designing a building with
high speed escalators which
would branch out into the hill-
side. An indoor. central build-
ing housing the escalators would
be located near the O’Hara park-
ing garage.

Mr. Montgomery mentioned
that “the problems of hillside
construction are hindering the
planning" of the escalator dor-
mitories. He said that construc-
tion costs may exceed the income
which would be derived from the
rental of dorm rooms. These and
other unknown factors have hin-
dered planning.

Financing for these dorms
would come from a bond issue.
The University would ask the
General State Authority to sell
bonds, and the University would
return the money to the state
from rental proceeds. A positive
factor with the plans for hillside
dorms is that the University al-
ready owns the land.

Thd University‘s second choice
for dormitories is the Forbes
Field area. Montgomery called
this location “an ideal place"
for housing. Grassy. flat. open
fields for recreation would be
built nearby for students. After
Forbes Field is torn down the
University plans a large complex
of educational facilities. so this
area would be a central location
for housing.

Money for these dormitories
would come from the Higher
Education Facilities Act. which
was set up to permit institutions
of higher learning to build dormi-

with federal borrowing. A prob-
lem with this is that the federal
government does not have much
money available for loans.

A third possible site for dor-
mitories is the land surrounding
the Veterans Hospital on top of
the engineering hill. These dorms
would occupy land on three sides
of the hospital. Like the old plans
for Trees Field. access to these
dormitories from the main cam-
pus would be a major problem.

Montgomery added that in the
future “There will be a demand
for apartments, not dormitories.”
Accordingly, the University is
considering plans for an apart-
ment building at an undisclosed
location. The University is also
considering the construction of
dormitories that would be con-
verted into apartments. Again, a
major problem here lies in the
cost of constructing such a build-
ing. The University definitely

The Penn State committee has
handled 1500 student disciplinary
cases over the past two years. It
also retains a lawyer who advises
those students who are in some
sort of trouble. Cases have ranged
from drinking violations to drugs.

Chairman of Penn State’s Le-
gal Awareness Committee Bruce
Gernand indicated that at Penn
State students are unaware of
their rights and that one of the
primary purposes of the Legal
Awareness Committee is to in-
form students of those things that
they can do under adverse legal
circumstances.

The Legal Awareness Commit-
tee at Penn State. is more than
a group that merely advises stu-
dents of their rights. says Ger-
nand. “It is an autonomous body
with which students can identi-
fy...

The Committee not only deals
with University disciplinary ac-
tions but with the civil authori-
ties. “This system. says Gernand.
“gives us a real autonomy and
has caused our committee to be-

come quite successful in the past
two years.

Gernand and the other mem-
bers of the Committee believe
that students have rights to cer-
tain things. Gernand believes
that students have the rights to
govern themselves. “We should
have the rights to make our own
disciplinary rules.” He pointed
out that such a system (students
molding their own rules-in the
University Community) has work-
ed admirably at Michigan State.
It has also been implemented at
Berkeley. “The University is sup-
posedly student oriented,” says
Gernand. “If this is the case, why
should an administrator who
knows nothing about students
have the right to tell us what to
do?” The members of the Com-
mittee believe that the college
administration does not have the
right. Nor, do they have the right
to tell a student he is suspended
because this does not fulfull the
student’s right of due process,
according to Gernand.

The Penn State Committee has

extensively researched the prob-
lems of student’s rights.._ They
have come to the conclusion that

most college students are dispos- ‘

sessed_These students merely ac-
cept the system and feel that
“nothing can be done”. The Com-
mittee is attempting to repossess
students by convincing them that
something can be done.

The‘ Penn State Committee mem-
bers suggested at a Conference
between Penn State and Pitt stu-

dents a solution to the Parking .

and commuter problem. They-
said that the Commuter’Associa-
tion could draw up a petition cal-
ling on the Mayor to make the
city parking meter on campus
all day meters. If the Mayor

failed to act on this petition, the”
committee members said. the ..

commuter association and the stu-
dent body in general should pic-
ket the Mayor’s office.

“If any student policy is to be
implemented.” said Penn State
Legal awareness Committee
Chairman Bruce Gernand,” a
threat of mobilization or demon-
stration must be explicit.”

prefers suites of rooms instead of
many rooms off of a hall, like the
Towers. Montgomery said, “Even
when we build dormitories, we
won’t build many rooms with
gang baths.” Montgomery envi-
sions suites of 6-10 people, with
about 100 people forming a
house. »

In the future. rental charges
for University housing will be
higher. This is inescapable says
Montgomery. The dorms are los-

Mortgages and services tend to
raise the rents. But he added that
even private housing costs more

Language Lab Plans Move,
Appoints Knudsen Director

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

The sixteenth floor of the Ca-
thedral will no longer echo stu-
dents’ voices changing “Co-mo es-
tas.” or “Par-lez-vous fran-cais."
The Language Lab is moving. The
Lab’s relocation has been dictated
by problems of limited space and
inconvenience in getting there

“when the elevators are crowded.”

Although. according to lab di-
rector Stuart Foreman. plans are
still “indefinite”. a likely home
for the lab could be the new
Common Facilities Building or
perhaps Alumni Hall.

Other innovations are being
planned. “I don't think the lab is
fully understood and accepted by
teachers or students. Both shy
away from the lab because they
are not oriented in its use. The
Lab is essentially for students to
master the oral elements of lan-
guage.” Foreman commented.
“Now is the time when decisions
as to location. purchase of new
equipment and services to be
offered are being made. We wel-
come suggestions and criticism
from students anp teachers alike.

One definite change will be
the importation of a new lab di-
rector from New York University.
He will be John Knudsen, Ph.D.
in Linquistics. Foreman, who will
remain here as assistant director,
said that Knudsen “hopes to bring
to the University the principles
and insights gaihdd from his ex-

periences.’$a

Although the function of the
lab will not change. the plans
in the making should greatly im-
prove its efficiency.

The spring operating hours of
the lab are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and
5 to 7:30 p.m. Mondays through
Thursdays. 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fri-
days and 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Satur-
days. The lab will be closed for
a short time during its relocation
later this summer.

Student Power

The concept of student power is one with many con-
notations. Some of its advocates contend that student power
explicity connotates the seizure of administrative buildings.
Other persons who adhere themselves to the concept be-
lieve there are other methods by which a group can attain its
ends.

We welcome with great pleasure the concept of student
power that is generated by Penn State’s Legal Awareness

‘Committee. This semi-autonomous unit protects of the ju-
dicial rights of the Penn State student body. Heretofore, it
{has handled some 1,500 disciplinary cases and has proviped
‘students with expert legal advice.

But Penn State’s Committee on Legal Awareness is
more than a student legal aid society, it is viable group
that has stumbled across the paths of ‘administrative inac-
tion; it is a group that has met hardship ahd won; it is a
group that will ultimately win great respect among the
Penn State student body.

This group believes that students should create the rules
by which a student body is governed. One of the Commit-
tee members suggested that this sort of system provides a
real education to the student.

The Pitt News finds itself in complete accord with this
concept. We, too, feel that students should govern them-
selves to certain degree. And we also contend that students
of this campus do not receive due process in disciplinary
action. ..  

It is with great pleasure, therefore, that we welco,nie.the
planning of a Student Government (SG) Legal Awareness
Committee. On this campus students need their rights pro-

tected. We certainly hope that SG can similarily retain an -

attorney to advise students of their rights. The SG Legal
Awareness Committee. however, is merely the first step for
we believe that the student body is tired of those organiza-
tions that have done nothing in the past. This can be seen by
the slim margin of victory in the SG election last February.
Students here are not only tired and frustrated by organiza-
tion ineptitude but by administrative inaction.

The Pitt News believes that the solution to this dual
problem is a movement of coalescence. By this The Pitt
News commits itself to the following campaigns in the fu-

ture :

-— We want a solution to the parking problem. But we sug-
gest that talking to the city planner or to Mayor Barr is not
the answer. Student protest must be heard. A petition should
be drawn up by the Commuter Association and presented to
the Mayor. And students protesting against a ludicrous
parking problem should feel no compunction in criticizing
the Mayor and his planners for their absolute inaction in
this area."l__‘he Pitt News will wage a campaign to eradicate
the University parking problem.

— We want a solution to problem of the in-state. out-of-
state student ratio. Informed sources have told us that this
years freshman class will be comprised of 92 per cent
Pennyslvania residents. This, we feel is dreadfully wrong
and creates a sort of inbreeding that can only be detrimen-
tal to the University. We will not let this University suc-
cumb to a regional status.

— We want a liberalization of the women’s curfew hours
for we think that college women should be mature enough
to mold and determine their own lives. The college woman,
it follows, should not be restricted by cumbersome and in-
sulting sign out systems.

Students at this University want many things that they
should rightfully have. No longer, we hope, will SG let
solid proposals fly out the window. And we plan to use
every method except violdnce, to attain those rights that
we, as students, deserve. The Pitt News looks optimistically
to a future of change at the University—a change that will
create a freer atmosphere on this campus.

A Hellraiseru

He Rose Again To Sit At His Side

by DAVID ROSENBLUM

And He came down heaven's
way. with heart of heavy and eyes
of moist. And he looked down
with sorrowed fullness as the
swarn of blue moved. and pushed.
and pulled. And the clubs rose
and He felt the quivering flesh.
And the clubs fell and He felt the
bruised flesh. And with a deep
sigh. He knew it was time for the
Coming.

“Next." bellowed the desk ser-
geant.

The officer moved forward.
pulling the young man in the
shredded white robe with him.
The man‘s beard was caked with
blood. and his right eye was swol-
len shut.

“What‘s with this one? Same as
the rest?"

THE OFFICER holding th e
young man shook his head.

“No." he said. “This is one of
their leaders. He was standin‘ in
the middle of them screamin‘ kids

an preachin peace. ‘Do not raise
thy hand against thy brother he
screamed at us. But we quieted
him down."

And he smiled at the sergeant
as he gently fingered his billy.

"Ain't that what you said
creep?" he hollored at his pris-
oner.

‘‘I DID SAY this."

“Yeh. An‘ then tell 'im what
else ya said.“

“I spoke the words. ‘I am the
Way and the Light.”

Thd desk sergeants eyes nar-
rowed. He stepped down from his
seat and walked in front of the
young man.

“YOU CRUMMY SOB! You’re
all the same. You guys get into
school and think you know every-
thing. And now you gotta start
with God too. You don’t know
nothing!"

He was shaking with rage. and
the calm of the young man made
him even angrier. He threw his

head back. gathered the saliva in
his mouth. and spit on the dried
blood of the One who stood be-
fore him. ‘

“Whats your name creep. Jesus
Christ?“

But the young man was weep-
ing quitely and did not hear the
man.

“WE AIN’T got no use for your
kind buddy.” the sergeant hissed.
“not now. and not ever. And the
more you raise hell. the more
were gonna club you down.“

The young man raised his eyes
to the ceiling of the jail.

“Now." H_e whispered with im-
measurable sorrow. “it is truly
overf‘

A bands Mr. User (who wrote a let-

ter to the editor asking for more
SU dances) has worked with in
the past. but the bands that cost
the unbelievable price of $80 per
night would be, at best. sub-me-
diocre. Even if we could find a
decent band for that price. the
novelty of dances would wear off
in a short time. The dances would
become a run—of-the-mill Univer-
sity function and be taken for
granted. After two weeks the re-
sponse would fall of tremendous-
ly.

Also. let me remind Mr. User
that there are social films almost
every weekend; a nd sufficient
dances scheduled for the term.

Public Demands Novel Quality

by /ALISA MOSER

Irony is the word to sum up the
odd relationship which has de-
veloped between public demands
and public acceptance of enter-
tainment. Lately there has been
great criticism of the rut televi-
sion has fallen into. Viewers com-
plain of silly situation comedies.
too many soap operas. repeats.
etc. The public demands quality:
more special programs on recent
scientific discoveries. on poverty
in America or any other news-
worthy "subject which will not
waste one's precious time. Qual-
it_v is the key word.

Yet. among these cries. the pub-
lic turns right around and accepts
anything new. anything novel.

Doyou make these ﬁve common mistakes
about selecting diamonds?

TESTIYOUR KNOWLEDGE. IF YOU ANSWER ALL FIVE QUESTIONS RIGHT, YOU’RE AN EXPERT.

1. The finest diamonds are, ._ ._ .
A. White B. Slightly yellow C. Blue-white
D. Colorless

2. When a diamond’s clarity is not marred by any scratch,
spot, cloud or other blemish, the gem can properly be
described as _, ._ .

A. “Ideal” B. “Perfect” C. “Flawless”

3. When professionals refer to a diamond 5

cut” they mean
A. Its general shape, such as round, oval, pear, marquise
or emerald.

B. The extent to which the angles and proportions of its
many sides, or facets, conform to the ideal for its par-
ticular shape.

C. The diamond’s ability to scratch other hard surfaces,
such as glass or steel.

4. The value of a diamond is determined by its
A. Carat weight B. Cut C. Color
E. Price

1 D. Clarity

5. Aside from diﬁerences in the price ranges of various prod-
ucts, selecting a diamond is most like choosing   .
A. a watch B. Savings bonds C. a steak D. a new car

Hereq’s bow to score your answers. ( But up
please, don’t read any furtber until I A
you've answered all tbe questions to
tbe best of your ability.)

1. If you checked answer “D,” you’re abso-
lutely right. The finest diamonds have no
color of their own whatever. They merely blaze
with all the colors of the light that enters them.

If you checked “Blue-white,” be careful. The term
is fraught with many meanings and loopholes. It is
used as a sales aid by some jewelers to help sell diamonds
of inferior color. Because “blue-white” is inexact and mis-
leading, we forbid the use of this term in referring to any
diamond at Hardy 8: Hayes.

2. If you checked “flawless,” you're right again. A ﬂawless dia-
mond is not necessarily a "perfect” one, however. The Federal
Trade Commission’s ruling on the use of this term states that
besides being ﬂawless a diamond must not be of inferior color or
make. There really is no such thing as a “perfect” diamond.

Like the term "blue-white,” the term “perfect” is forbidden
at Hardy & Hayes.

3. You are right if you chose answer "B.” Diamonds are cut in
different styles, such as round, oval, etc. There are Ideal angles
and proportions for each style. L

When a professional refers to cut, he is talking about the
human factor of a diamond’s beauty. just how well has man done
his job? If the cutter deviates from the precise angles and propor-
tions of the Ideal, your diamond would have less beauty and
should therefore cost you less than a more precise cut.

4. If you chose any one of the four Cs, you're partly right. A
diamond’s value is determined by all four.

The price you pay for a diamond includes more than the value
of the gem itself; the value of the ring or other setting, for in-
stance. A portion of the seller’s cost of doing business also is in-
cluded, as is his proﬁt.

Because all Hardy 8: Hayes diamonds are obtained directly,
via New Yor gutters, from the London sights of the Central
Selling Organization (marketing arm for all jewelry diamonds
in the world) our price does not include the proﬁts and expenses
of intermediate brokers, wholesalers or agents. For this reason,
you often pay less at Hardy & Hayes than you would elsewhere
for a diamond of comparable quality.

judge for yourself. We’ll give you a booklet’? that explains
how the various characteristics of a diamond are rated and
how the professionals compare one diamond with another. It’s a

 
  
  
   
  
   
   

clearly written little booklet, easy to un-
derstand. We’ll answer any questions you
may have and, if you have time, show you‘
examples of the characteristics you’ll want to
watch for.

Then shop around.

5. Buying a diamond has something in common with all
four possible answers, of course. Watches and automobiles,
being manmade, can be standardized, however. You can usually
expect one new car to perform as well and ride as comfortably as
another of the same make, model and equipment. But nature
never does anything quite the same way twice. , . -

Savings bonds have but one variable—their size, or dollar
value. You look at the denomination and you know what each
one’s worth. Not so a diamond. .

Selecting one is thus most like choosing a steak. No two are
quite alike. Price per pound (or carat) is only one of several
considerations. Color and clarity are as important in a diamond
as tenderness and ﬂavor in a steak. And cut, certainly, is vital to
both.

Of course, one way to be sure of getting a good steak is to go to
a good butcher. We’ll spare you the rest of this analogy.

I f you got four of tbe ﬁve questions rigbt, your knowledge of
diamonds is above average. But even if you missed only one, it
would be wise to find out all you can about diamonds before
you actually invest in one. We'll be deligbted to belp you learn
as mucb as you care to. Don’t feel you'd be imposing. After all,
tbe more you know about diamonds, tbe better for us.

*If you would like us to mail the booklet to you at home, simply send us

a postcard, giving your name and mailing address. We'll send your ’
booklet the day we get your card. '

Reflections

YonMuhammad Hath
Lean and Hungry Look

by Roy Jacobs
Sports Editor

mnanaaaaaanaaaaaaai
Muhammed Ali slipped in and out of Pittsburgh last week
quicker than he disposed of Sonny Liston in Lewiston. Me.
Namely. he didn’t show at all (Did he hit Sonny Liston at all?).
In order that he might stay in New York for three and two-thirds
rounds of a light-heavyweight title fight. Ali sent countless stu-
dents at Point Park and Pitt down for the count.

All this means nothing. really. What is interesting though.
is that All despite his Black Muslim ties. despite his draft-
dodger status. and despite his recent lack of fighting. still re-
mains an attraction to fight fans and non-fight fans alike. In
fact. most everybody will agree that Ali—or. if you’d rather.
Cassius Clay—shou1d never have been stripped of his heavy-
weight title. At least not yet.

But the day that Ali failed to step forward for induction
into the army he was stripped of the title now held by his for-
mer sparring mate. Now only a highly improbable Supreme
Court reversal separates him from a $10,000 fine and a five-
year prison sentence. Why. then. does Ali not fade from the pub-
lic eye? _'

Perhaps, as many people seem to think, the anti-war senti-
ment in America allows for the tolerance of Ali’s refusal to
serve. Certainly, he is not alone in his dissent.

But to this writer. Ali’s appeal. although somewhat on the
wan. can be attributed to a different source. It can. in fact. be
traced back to 1960.

Then. as a poetry-slinging. Olympic champion~—and as Cas-
sius Clay—he embarked on his professional heavyweight career.
To say the least, he had character. He ‘brought life to a dying

 sport. He captured not only the public. but the press. Who cared

when he didn’t really beat Doug Jones. but won anyway?
Everybody was on his side.

By the time Clay became heavyweightchampion, he had
the potential to become the most popular sports figure of the 60’s.
And in many ways he could have accomplished something good
for the black man. Maybe something concrete or maybe only
something symbolic. But something. 1

Instead. he changed horses. And names. His pal was Mal-
colm X. The Muslims were going to get something done. In-
stead. Malcolm X was gunned down. and the young Clay knew
he was in for keeps. It was fine then, but is it still fine now?

As a fighter. Ali commands tremendous respect. But now he
isn’t fighting. and sooner or later people are going to tire of
hearing him preach. His days with the Muslims haven’t been
happy ones. He is virtually penniless-he cannot touch the mon-
ey in his trust fund for another ten years—and his only revenue
comes from speaking engagements. Hardly big payoffs.

Today, Cassius Clay could fill any arena in the world to
watch him box. But Muhammad Ali can’t get anyone to pro-
mote or fight him. He is just about at the end of the line. One
step from prison.

Pittsburgh students probably missed their last chance to
see All for five years. They would have enjoyed him. too. He is
still a character. But the spark is gone. and the man who could
have been. never will be.

Netters Trounce Hiram 7-2;,,é,;,

Wilson Stars In ’68 Finale

by MARTHA HARTLE

.. . .The nettersended the rain-drenched ‘68 season on a bright
note Saturday with a 7-2 win over Hiram College.

Coach Ben Popes netmen won five of six singles matches and two
of three doubles contests to handle their Ohio foes without much diffi-

culty.

Senior captain Bob Salembier. who had been named Most Valu-

Rain Mars
Record For
Pope, Team

The ‘68 season for the net-
ters will go down in the record
books as a losing one at 7-8. but
for the coach and players. ‘68 was
8 winner.

“Even though it’s not on our
record." explained Coach Ben
Pope." the boys still feel they
put in a winning season. We fin-
ished with seven wins and eight
losses. but we should have been
9-8. Two important matches which

we probably would have won,

were cancelled due to rain."

Rain washed out the Allegheny
and Duquesne contests. Pope and
the players were optimistic for
wins in both.

“The Hiram coach (whose team
was downed by the netters 7-2
Saturday) told us we would have
had no trouble beating Allegheny,”
added Pope, “and we were almost
positive of beating Duquesne.”

The Allegheny match was re-
scheduled twice and rained out
both times.

“Overall. however. the season
was a good. but we were disap-
pointed to losing to Carnegie-Mel-
lon. That was our big disappoint-
ment of the year.” continued the
coach. The netters lost that heart-

" breaker to CMU two weeks ago

5-4.

“We were also hurt this season
when Bill Goldstein, a senior,
finished school in April and went
home,” quipped Pope. “Goldstein
was a very good _p_lave_r, on the
level of Bob .Salem‘bier.,”

Four seniors completed varsity
careers for Pope this season and
depth could become a problem
next spring. Captain Bob Salem-
bier. Bill Nichols. Chuck Wilson
and Elliott Sanier will all gradu-
ate.

But Tom Stromp. John King.
J.D. Lewis and Jim Thompson
will be back. It will be their
job to try and put the winning
record back in the record books.

5 Navy Hands Golfers Eighth Loss

The team’s captain, Rick Golden, matched Navy’s

X. Buzhart after 18 holes, 75-75. On the first playoff

. hole, Golden parred to gain the point that prevented
a shutout, as Buzhart bogied.

Pete Keller was the only other Pitt golfer who

came close to a point. He went down by one stroke.

Rain plays a major part in chances. A match

against Duquesne has been rained out twice and fmngam

must be played if there is to be any hope. Peery does
not think that the match will be played.

 

 

 
 
   
   
 

‘not look like they are good enough to handle a team
,. like Penn State. third place finishers in the Easterns
 a few weeks back. "

»- a hard one to get.

“Duquesne‘s having exams: it’s probably off
now.” he mentioned.

The squad has a 6-8 record and only one other
match is ontheir schedule. That one is set for Sat-
urday against Penn State at home course Shannopin.

The loss to Navy indicates that the duffers do

fired an 81.

As the score indicates. the duffers didn't come
close. They managed only the one point. and it was

 
 

The rest of the matches were won by Navy
golfers by large margins. John Meteney gired a 77 :
his opponent shot a 72. Henry Higgenbottom came
up with a rather high 85 in his loss. Navy‘s Walters

John Dellaverson and Mike McGuire shot 81's,
but neither was good enough to down their Navy
rivals. Both Midshipmen fired 76’s.

The final loss was handed to newcomer Joe
Kruth (82 by R. Edmonds of Navy who shot a 74.

Kruth replaced Bill Bryan. the team‘s most pro-
ductive golfer this spring. Exams forced Bryan to

dropped the only singles match
of the day on a default.

“Bob got very weak and sick

during his match,” explained Pope, .

“so he defaulted. But twenty min-
utes later he felt better and came
out to play doubles.”

In that doubles match. Salem-
bier and Tom Stromp teamed up
to win easily over Art Scott and
Chuck Yerrick 6-3. 6-3. l.

But the star of the afternoon
for the netters according to Pope
was Chuck Wilson. Wilson was
a winner in both singles and
doubles Saturday and “played the
best he ever played."

In singles, Wilson Beat Al
Hayes 6-2, 6-2. “Before the match
Chuck didn’t think he could beat
that boy,’ added the coach, “but
he did.” Wilson, a senior, had
just come out for the team this
year.

In doubles. Wilson and Elliott
Sanier both playing their last
match of varsity competition,
went three sets to beat Hayes and
John Friedberg 6-2. 5-7. 8-6. San-
ier defeated Friedberg earlier in
the afternoon in singles 6-2. 6-4.

Number one man Bill Nichols
also ended his varsity career on
a winning note. defeating Bill
Kelly 7-5. 6-2. Nichols held down
the number one spot for three
years for Pope.

underclassmen currently on the
squad, also picked up singles wins.

Stromp downed Bill Buckley
easily 6-3. 6-2. The win gave
Stromp the best individual record
of the season at 10-3-1. The tie
occurred at West Virginia early
in the season in a match which
was called off because of dark-
ness with the score deadlocked
3-3 in the third-set.

This marked the second straight
year that Stromp has led the net-
ters in won-lost percentage. Last
year. he finished with a 10-3 slate.

“Tom has improved without
practice. That's what’s remark-
able,” added Pope. “He’s been
working and doesn’t get a chance
to practice. The only time he
comes out is when we have a
match. With practice, he could
be number one or number two for
us.”

King..who along with Stromp
will form the nucleus of next
year’s squad. went three sets to
beat Yerrick 6-2. 3-6. 6-3. King
and Nichols dropped the only
other point of the contest as they
lost to Buckley and Kelly in
doubles 6-4. 6-2.

 

  

  

EVEN WHILE the mitters were sweeping two games from Penn State

(above, Tom Stickel scores), it rained briefly. Afterwards it rained some

more. In fact, it rained so much that Saturday's home baseball and
track events had to be called off.

   

Despite clear skies ‘and sunny
weather in Pittsburgh Saturday.
two home athletic events were
called off. Neither the baseball
teams game with Hiram. nor the
track teams meet with Ohio Uni-
versity went off as scheduled.

Saturday marked the first time
in ‘over two weeks that there was
no rain. but both contests had

been cancelled during Friday's

 

downpour. It was the last time
either team was scheduled at
home.

The mitters end their season to-
day against Lafayettein Easton.

Weltyi;’Pitches Season’s Last Game
Against Lafayette Nine Tomorrow

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

In their final game of the
1968 season tomorrow. the
Panther baseballers oppose the
Lafayette nine in Easton. Pa.
Baseball coach Bobby Lewis plans

to start the ace of his pitching-

staff. Dave Welty.

“Welty will probably s t a rt
against Lafayette." said Lewis.
realizing that his southpaw ace is
a senior. “It'll be his last game."

Tomorrow's game will be Wel-

,ty‘s last as a college player. but it
wont be the last’ game of his ca-
reer.
..“I‘m going to take a shot at ma-
jor league baseball as a career."
said Welty modestly. “I'll give it
a couple of years."

The hard-throwing left-hander
has caught the eves of many ma-
jor league scouts since his sopho-
more year.

"I really wanted to sign a pro-
fessional baseball contract in my
sophomore year." admitted Wel-
ty. “but the rules were changed
and you couldn’t sing a contract
if you were in school."

Last year, the Pittsburgh native
was 6-1 and surrendered only two
earned runs all season, while com-
pleting an amazing 0.32 ERA.

Last year would have been the

ideal time for Welty to sign a con-
tract; his pitching-statistics would
have given him good bargaining
power. But again the .\'CAA rules
prevented him from signing.

However. Weltvs pitching rec-
ords this season are not nearly
as impressive. Going into tomor-
rows game. Dave is an unimpres-
sive 4-3 and his ERA has jumped
to 2.90. But Lewis doesnt think
this season will hurt Welty’s
chances to turn professional.

“I don't think this year will
hurt Dave at all.” said Lewis op-
timistically. “Last year was just
an unbelievable year; he couldn’t
possibly have had a better season.
Many scouts are still very inter-
ested in him.”

Some of the scouts are also in-
terested in Welty as an outfield

prospect.

fielder." said Welty. "but I want
to try it as a pitcher.”

Welty throws an assortment of
hard fastballs. curve balls, sliders
and change-ups. And the lefty
hurler also has a great pick-off
move. Twice this season. against
Bucknell and Kent State, Welty
picked off three runners in a sin-
gle game.

Tomorrow. Welty plans to show
Lafayette the talent that has made
him a pro-prospect. Then he‘ll
wait for a major league team to
draft him.

MBA Squads Split Games;

Whites Win 2 1-7 in IM Ball    

Softball teams from the MBA split two games in intramural ac-
tion last week. MBA White had little trouble with Biochemistry. win-
ning 21-7. but MBA Blue took it on the chin. dropping a 6-4 decision
to the Pathetics.

The Whites took a 5-3 lead in the first inning and never had any
trouble the rest of the way. scoring six runs in both the third and fifth
innings. The big blow was a three-run homer by Lauch in the first
frame. Thompson belted a four-bagger for the losers.

A three-run second inning wasn’t good enough for the Blue as the
Pathetics came up with five runs in the third. Hits by King, Houseman,
and Yablonsky, followed by a double by Moritz produced the Blues’
three-run rally. A A .

HUE, South Vietnam (CPS) ~— The Monsoon had lifted, the
sun beat down, and warmth had replaced the damp cold of be-
fore. Much of the rubble had been cleared from the streets and
they were now filled with young boys in their schoolboy blue
trousers and white short-sleeve shirts and the beautiful. bashful
Hue girls in their spotless white ao dai dresses. Now and then
a ragged little boy in a red Suzuki cap could be seen and heard ringing

a bell. advertising his ice cream.

But in spite of the markedly less gloomy atmosphere. evidence of

the recent disaster was obvious.

Alongside the roads were fresh
graves. Bodies were buried where
they fell. often in the little parks.
frequently incongrously within
inches of the main road. Many
were covered with little yellow
flowers.

The traditional burying places
had not been accessible when it
first became possible to bury the
dead. But perhaps soon the bodies
will be moved to family plots, at
least in caeses where the bodies

All South Vietnamese students

more a morale booster than a mil-

T h e Saigon government h a s
been under pressure from Ameri-
can officials to involve the city-
dwelling. middle and upper-class
Vietnamese who have been able
to avoid any.involvement in the
war and have even flaunted their
affluence and privileged status in
the midst of the war. It is largely
a symbolic gesture since the sons
of the rich will continue to re-
ceive their deferments. even study
in Europe if they like. wh'l heir

 

  

    
 

        
   

mothers and fathers will tour the
continent on buying sprees.

At the Imperial palace, which
had been the scene of the last
ditch fighting in Hue, the red and
gold, Chinese-styled, delicately-
carved gatehouse has assumed a
new posture. It looked intoxicated
and leaned abruptly and precari-
ously in several directions. It had
been heavily damaged.

I climbed the fortifications
overlooking the Perfume River on
the South side of the citadel and
could see what a fine gun position

, the NLF-DRVN forces had dur-

ing their Tet offensive. I could
see miles in each direction.

In the once beautiful South-
west corner of the Citadel. tin
shacks had replaced the fine
homes there before. These shacks
belonged to the former homeown-
ers. One large area of the city.
near Tran Cao Van St.. had been
bulldozed and replaced with a
series of barracks-like sheds hous-
ing about 200 families in 15 foot
wide units.

“It’s all temporary,” said Col-
onel Frank Jakes, the Psychologi-
cal Warfare (Psy-Ops) advisor in
Hue. But “temporary” is not a
comforting word when you’ve had
20 years of war.

‘Col. Jakes rattled off a list of
things that were being done for
a small coterie of reporters. The
rice. tin. and cement. promised
by the government. was arriving.
he noted. But the heavy equip-
ment necessary to unload it was
not available yet.

The south side. less damaged
than the north. now had water and
electricity. but the north was not
restored yet. Elementary schools

and junior high schools were still
closed. '

Of the 85,000 persons displaced
by the fighting, between 10,000
and 40,000 had taken up residence
in Da Nang. Jakes said he expect-
ed only some of these to return.
Prices in Da Nang were much
higher and the cost of living
would force a return to less se-
cure Hue. So far, 1,000 families
had received aid.

Jakes estimated that 20 per cent
of the city was totally destroyed;
another 50 per cent was half de-
stroyed.

He praised the youth groups
who had helped to bring relief to
the city. (Though he didn’t men-
tion it, a good percentage of the
aid was provided by the much-
maligned militant Buddhist
groups.)

During the fighting, 938 were
killed, 770 wounded and 171 are
missing. The local government is
again functioning. (I later learned
that most of the policemen in Hue
had been brought in from Saigon
which accounted for my inabil-
ity to get directions from them.)

The Perfume River Bridge
which joins the divided city. had
been blown early in the fighting
by the NLF. The center is now
spanned with a pontoon section.
Small boys spent most of their
days diving into the water while
the people of Hue transport all
manner of things, including bicy-
cles. across the difficult part.

Reconstruction will begin in a
month and will take two or three
months to complete. The contract
has been awarded to RMK-BRJ.
the powerful American construc-
tion consortium that does most of
America’s building.

Jakes complained that recent
statements by President Thieu and
President Ky that Hue is likely to
be hit again had an adverse ef-
fect on morale in the city. Some
business men have felt for good,”
Air Vietnam, the government
owned civilian airline, has al-
ready evacuated 1,700 people and
has a backlog of passengers.

The people of Hue are afraid
of a second attack. Hue is sur-
rounded. American military per-
sonnel say. and the people know
it too.

Many of the North Vietnamese
soldiers who were around Khe
Sanh are now in the A Shau valley
within easy reach of Hue. The A
Shau is now the target for numer-
ous large and secret search and
clear operations and massive B 52
raids.

A second attack could come at
any time. American authorities
have said. All the rebuilding may
be for naught.
