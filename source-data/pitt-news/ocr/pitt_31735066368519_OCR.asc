The University Center for
International Studies (UCIS) at
Pitt has received a grant from the
National Endowment for the
Humanities (NEH) and- the
Alfred Jurykowski Foundation
totalling $43,870 for the dissemi-
nation of “Polish Phoe’nix”———a
‘ three-screen, multi-image pres-
entation spanning 1,000 years of

,whistory and culture in Poland.

“The Polish. Phoenix” was
created by a Pitt research team

in the summer of 1979, photo-
graphing Polish art, historical

The Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tions Board (PLRB) has dismissed
the suit that book center employees
brought. against the university in
January.

The PLRB ruled, in-effect, that

Pitt did not attempt to thwart union-
organizing activity at the bookstore

V by ﬁring two employees and sus-P

pending three others over a three-
week period in early January. The
employees filed the suit with the
Allegheny Joint Regional Board
(AJ RB). .

Patricia Crawford, secretary of ‘
the PLRB, said she based her deci-
sion on the information submitted
by AJ RB representatives. There
was, however, supplementary infor-

mation (submitted in addition to the
original allegations and two amend-
ments' to those allegations) that was

V dropped because of technical errors.

“Although it may be generally
known...that there is a unionization
underway at the university, it was
not necessarily‘ apparent from the
charges filed that there was any link
between the unionization and the
actions that were taken by the uni-
versity,” Crawford said.

She also said that there were some
questions concerning notarization
of some of the materials and legal

order to sustain the charges.

“I’ve already prepared a letter to

versity .of Pittsburgh. The area
between Forbes and Fifth
avenues that contains the
Cathedral of Learning, Heinz
Chapel and the Stephen Foster
Memorial stands out as a grace-
ful, reverent tribute to an age
when spiritual beauty was sought
in the construction of institu-
tions of higher education.

As a monument to one of
Pittsburgh’s most recognized
natives, the Stephen Foster
Memorial represents a devotion
to cultural heritage that the uni-
versity has strived to maintain
through the decades.

The memorial, which was built
in 1937, was first conceived as an
idea in I927 by the Tuesday Mu-
sical Club at Pitt, which wanted
to erect a permanent monument

to Foster.

constructed as that of the‘Uni- ‘

Foster Memorial Beautifies
Campus With History

According to Agnes Lynch
Starrett, dean of women from
l9l9 to 1941 and author of sev-
eral volumes of books on Pitt
history, ideas such as the con-
struction of the Foster memorial
were encouraged and inspired by
Chancellor John Bowman,
whose philosophy of education
also provided the impetus behind
the construction of the Cathedral
of Learning.

The university gave ground for
the memorial opposite the old
Schenley Hotel, and with a
group of donors that included
Mrs. Andrew W. Mellon and the
Buhl Foundation. Josiah Lilly, a
philanthropist, stepped in to
offer not only his money, but a-
collection of Foster memor-

A abilia.

Lilly, a pharmaceutical manu-
facturer from Indiana, possessed
the most complete collection of
Foster material anywhere,
including first editions of Fos-
ter’s music and other Foster

g remembrances.

His collection is on display in
the shrine located in the memo-
rial hall, along with Foster’s
bible, wallet and a mid-century
50-cent piece that was struck in
his memory.

The building itself, which was
designed by architect Charles
Klauder, is made of Indiana
limestone from Lilly’s home state

_and follows the Gothic style of
the Cathedral and the Heinz
Chapel. The Foster memorabi-
lia, encased in slip covers, are on
shelves within six alcoves that
can be entered through a series of
carved, stone arches. The wood
in thebuilding is hand-carved
English oak, and the lobby and
museum floors are made of a u-
nique orange material called
Tennessee crab orchard stone.

The windows of the Foster
Memorial depict, in stained
glass, the songs that made Foster
famous: “My ‘Old Kentucky
Home, Good-Night!” “Oh,
Susannah” and “Jeannie With
the Light Brown Hair.”

that Pitt engaged in what are “pro-
tected activities” under Act 195.

Those activities, he said, deal with '

permitting the organization of a
labor union. ’
“[The PLRB] is claiming that it

has not recognized a correlation yet '

between the suspensions and termi-
nations and union activity,” Scheid
said. “I’m very surprised that they
haven't recognized a violation."
Tim Brady, a fired employee, said
he made a call to the Harrisburg
office of the PLRB to get more
information on the ruling—
information, he said, that Chuck
Delaney (the other fired employee)
and Victor Sciullo (a suspended
employee) had received on Feb.’25.

information was discarded for lack
of proper procedure. —
“Our standard procedure at this
stage, - the pre-complaint stage, is
that we only go on the basis of what
has been filed; in other words,
whether it’s technically sufficient in

the way that it is written up,” Craw-

ford said. “And on that basis, we
found that we did not have sufficient
indication of a violation to warrant
the issuance of a complaint.”

Crawford said no ‘investigation,
such as questioning the parties
involved, was completed. She said
the decision was handed down after
the PLRB found no “sufficient cause
of action in accordance with the stat-
utory provisions that the PLRB
enforces.”

The PLRB decision in this case,
she said, was based on the legal
standards of how people are sup-
posed to file charges with the board.
She said its procedure is constructed
in accordance with the law and that
a decision will be completedon any
original filing based on the technical
correctness of that filing.

decision, the director of Health and

“I suppose in the most generic

previously was that I wouldn’t,

Faculty Reductions

By ANN O'CONNOR

The failure of the state legislature
to provide incremental funds to Pitt
correlative to regular cost of living
increases will lead to further FAS
faculty -reductions in. the future.
Dean Jerome Rosenberg described
the process as one of “adjustment”
over an 8- or 9-year period and esti-
mated the budgetary cuts to be in the
range of 1-2 percent a year.

4 Rosenberg said that Pitt wit-
nessed its largest size faculty in 1972-
1973; from that point on, budgetary
restraints have become a continuing

problem. Particularly, in the first
half of the decade, faculty reduc-
tions were implemented in response
to declining enrollment. In the
second half of the decade, Rosen-
berg associated the reductions with
inflationary pressures.

Moreover, Rosenberg empha-
sized that reductions themselves
simply took advantage of the nor-
mal turnover. When positions open
up ‘due to retirement, resignation or
the end of a contractual agreement,
the positions simply will not be

that the “priorities of the university
need to be looked at more carefully”
and that FAS should receive “a
larger portion of the pie.” More
importantly, Cottam asserted that
the question of FAS faculty reduc-
tions is very large in scope and thus
his comments should be viewed in
that context.

In response to the concerns about
faculty reductions, Dr. Freeman,
senior vice-chancellor for the

administration, described the pro- ;

.cess whereby actual budgetary cuts
and parameters are established. He
said that initially the administration
establishes how large the “Priority
Fund,” a fund instituted to keep
“new programs alive,” should be.

The budgetary objective is then to

,reduce the total budget by the

amount of the Priority Fund figure
by making budgetary cuts else-
where. Further, Freeman stressed
that every unit makes a contribution
towards this goal in the form of
funding reductions, and it is the job
of the provost to determine the unit
contributions based upon his budge-
tary knowledge.

wrong or right.

University counsel Ron Talarico
also refused comment. He said that
Pitt has a legal, moral and business-
like responsibility to keep informa-
tion on employees and students
confidential.

“We keep a full documentation on
all employees,” Talarico said. “Whe-
never there is any action taken on
any employees, there is always a full
letter of detail given to them. Now, if

they would like to release that infor-

mation to anyone, that’s fine. But
Pitt cannot

the finer details and the exact cuts. .

However, Freeman asserted that the
dean is responsible for maintaining
academic interests as well.

Interestingly, Freeman described
“the proportion of budget cuts con-
cerning FAS, not only fair but also
more than equitable.” He noted

that, generally, the administration I;
/’

attempts to give some proportional-
ity to the various departments when

considering the size of the unit

contributions.

Historically, Freeman said, “F AS
has received less than a proportional
share of cuts,”and therefore, he con-
sidered the treatment towards FAS
“lenient.” -

As for the impact on the students
of the FAS faculty reductions,
Rosenberg said that possibly “the
average class size might increase
and/ or the variety of courses in CAS
mighfdecline.” I -

Although Rosenberg believed‘)

that it was too early to determine the
exact number of reductions, he did
stress that CAS presently offers over
1,000 different courses with a large

Dr. Richard Cottam expressed

LIS

Planning
Workshops

By PEGGY FERRI

Finding the right job is diffi-
cult for any student, especially in
these slow economic times. But
the Pitt School of Library‘ and
Information Science is planning
a placement workshop to help
students in their job hunting.

The purpose of the workshop
is to provide the SLIS majors
with the information they need
to assess their skills, prepare for
job interviews and determine
what prospective employers look
for in an employee.

The workshops will begin on
Thursday, March 10, and repeat.
They are sponsored by the
Alumni Association and_various
other student organizations
within the school and will be held
in Forbes Quadrangle. .

Pitt graduate Zella Kay Soich
has assisted SLIS in this effort
and said she ﬁnds there is a stu-
dent need for workshops of this
kind.

“The need is seated in the stu-
dents themselves,” Soich
explained. “Few of them have

had the opportunity to look for.

professional positions.”
She added that students need

assistance to prepare them for‘

what is expected of them.

“The competition in the field
of information science is no less
than it is in any other discipline,”
Soich said, “but most prospec-
tive employers don't really
understand what information
science is." I

Soich explained that informa-
tion science is the theory of infor-
mation management. In
short,the person draws upon
tools such as technology and
evaluates what information
needs to be organized or man-
aged and then designs a system to

y do this. I

“The students know that they
have the skills, but they have
trouble telling others [prospec-
tive employers],” she added.

"The number of sessions have
been limited due to space con-

straints, according to Soich, but
she is expecting between 50 and
70 students for each session.

The sessions are designed to
point students into areas within
business sections as well as to.

§_Governmenta|. Relations Committee To Lobby

 

ay PAUL CORREA

The Governmental Relations
Committee (GRC) will be entering

V its most. extensive lobbying period

this week. GRC will be sending
representatives to lobby in Harris-
burg during Pitt's budget hearing

before the state Senate this Friday. A

GRC wil also‘ be attendingithe

7" _' National" Student Action Confer-

ence in ewashington, D.C.
The main objective in Harrisburg
will be to try to increase appropria-

: _ tions to Pitt. As it now stands, the

Thornburgh administration is
increasing aid to Pitt by L9 percent,
according , to Chuck Pascal, a
member of GRC. Pascal said, “That
is actually a decrease in real terms
when you consider inﬂation to be
between 3-4 percent.” E

‘According to Connie Kreischer,

chairperson of GRC, the Thom- ‘

burgh administration puts a low
priority on funding education. For
example, Thornburg_h’s budget this
year -calls for no increase in
PHEAA’s appropriations.
Kreischer said that “it’s cheaper to
go to WVU as an out-of state stu-

' dent than to go.to Pitt as an in-state

student." Kreischer added that Pitt
has the fourth highest tuition in the
country. ' 

If the Pitt administration’s and ‘

GRC’s efforts are unsuccessful, it

A s will most likely mean an increase in

tuition. This mearisthat the GRC
will also be lobbying the administra-
tion in this respect. “It seems that

whenever cuts are made through the

students’ pockets,” Kreischer said,
adding that “a cut in state anpropn-
ations should not automatically
V mean that Jack Freeman has to say
that tuition is going up.” Pascal said
that “tuition at Pitt has gone up 5!
percent since l978—which is cer-
tainly not in line with inﬂation.”

In Washington, the GRC will
attend a rally on the steps of the
nation’s Capitol on March 7.

According to Kreischer, March 7 is A

National Student Action Day. GRC
will have a chance to meet "with
, Pennsylvania Senators John Heinz
and Arlen Specter and local Con-
gressmen John Coyne and Doug
Walgren. Among the issues GRC
:will be discussing with the lawmak-
ers are. student aid and Reagan's

‘ budget.

. How effective is GRC’s lobbying
efforts? According to Kreischer,
their effectiveness comes through
letting the legislators know that we
are still here and thatwe are capable
of causing a little “fuss.” Kreischer
said that their effectiveness would be
greater if students would vote more.
“Students don't vote so" why should
the legislators worry about them?”

According to Pascal, students are

traditionally non-voters as com-'

pared to senior citizens. Pascal said,
“They [legislators] could never do
anything to senior citizens because
they traditionally are a high-voter

turnout group.” Pascal added that if .

money is taken from students, thev
don‘t complain and thev don't vote.

Even worse, a lot of students don’t
even know that aid is beingcut. Pas-
cal said, “It's as if the students don't
care, that it’s not affecting them
directly so why worry about it?”

I Pascal said that if an issue came '

up that affected the students in a
more direct way, they would be
more vocal about it. “What if the
state planned to raise the drinking
age? Then students would become
very vocal. With tuition hikes and

aid» cuts, the students are not
affected as much because ‘it's morea
problem for their parents than
them.‘ ” . r ,

GRC plans at least one lobbying

trip per month to Harrisburg-

According to Kreischer,. they don‘t

like to go on lobbying trips unless ..

there is an important issue.

The legislators are “extremely”
receptive" to GRC representatives,

according to Kreischer. “We
develop a good rapport with the
legislators.” -

Kreischer believes that the GRC’s
lobbying efforts are the best in the
state. Kreischer said, “I don‘t think

other schools concentrate on lobby-

  Facing   T
The Flood

I
I

In the past, Pitt has tried to meet the needs of
students with a wide range of academic abilities,
offering courses from remedial math to honors
physics. The recent surge of applications to Pitt
raises some interesting questions that require an
examination of Pitt’s role as an institution.

\ V . \ First, in light of the program cutbacks

announced this year—with more anticipated in
. the future—can Pitt accommodate an increase in
@enrollment of up to 25 percent? More students
would mean more money from tuition, but only
part of the cost of educating a student is covered
by tuition’. More students could mean more cost ,
for the university. ’

‘If Pitt’s goal in the ’80s is to bring Ivy League
standards to Pittsburgh, then a flood of applica-
tions may be an opportun_ity to become more
selective in admissions. In fact, the most common
response for a university faced with more applica-
tions than available openings is to become more
selective. -If this occurs, however, Pitt would,
without thinking, put an end to its efforts to
educate the full range of local students.

Long before Pitt had any nationally-acclaimed
departments or programs for particularly bright
students, it opened its doors to area residents who
could handle college level work but were not able
to study at more prestigious universities.

This effort has been very important both to Pitt
and to the Western Pennsylvania area, and it
should not be" abandoned without careful consid-
eration. If Pitt raises the minimum standards for
admission, it may turn away -many’ students for
whom Pitt. offers the only hope of a higher
education. » A

Pitt may well decide to forego this part of its
play», but once again, that decision should be
made only after careful thought and not auto-
matic response to a budgeting problem.

Dear Editor:

Your article in the Dec. 17 issue of
The Pitt News states that alcohol '
will be eliminated from the univer-

article says that ORL states this
would be an injustice to‘ Pitt
students.

Alcohol consumption affects the.
quality of a student’s work since
drinking involves a great deal of_
time. Not only does it take the time
you are wasting.._while you drink, but
it takes the time after drinking that

Treating Anorexia

Regarding treatment, most sub-
jects that come through the Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic pro-
gram are seen as outpatients. Inpa-
tient. treatment is again a small,
though significant, part of the pro-
gram. Family therapyis essential to
younger subjects; they are not
accepted into the inpatient program
unless their family agrees to partici-
pate in treatment. ~

For college women living away
from home, family therapy is clearly
less relevant. and individual cogni-
tive therapy is preferable.

Finally. on a more technical level.
l do not believe that anorectic sub-

_j€CIS have a distorted body image.
They have a fear of gaining weight. .

start an organization-to help with
alcohol problems of the students. It
should also spread the word that

"alcohol is indeed dangerous. This

could turn into a national organiza-

not only the college student, but jun-

 L Socrates‘Hits The Employment

it ..,_.-_,—-an W: - '

By STEVE PARKS

Several weeks ago Socrates tried to
become Posvaris replacement, unfortu-
nately he was turned down. Undaunted by
this apparent setback, he decides to try to‘
return to Pitt as a teacher. With this in mind,
he goes to Pitt’s Employment Agency to
apply for a job.

Approaching the white counter, Socrates
asks, “Is this where I apply for a job?”

“Sure is,” said the clerk, smacking her
gum. ‘ .

“Could I have an application for being a
teacher?”

“A teacher?” the clerk laughed, “Pitt _

doesn't hire teachers!”

“They don’t! Do they have enough
already?” asked Socrates.

“Well, no. I meansome classes have as
many as 300 kids in them.” 1

“That’s awful large, still, I’m sure the best
teachers teach thoseiclasses,” commented
Socrates. '

“Get serious! Do you think that a good
teacher would ;:want\ a class that large?
Maybe a part-time teacher with no research
project might teach that one,” she said, sur-
prised at his ignorance.

“You mean a rich university like Pitt can’t
afford to have a full-time teaching staff?”

“Not exactly, they just don’t see a reason
for having teachers who aren’t bringing
research projects to the school. After all, Pitt
is supposed to be a leader in research.”

“But what if the students have problems,
how are they supposed_to get a hold of the
teacher? Are there any full-time teachers

» who the students have for classes, that they

can get a hold of?”

“Of course, but these teachers are usually
doing research or trying to get research
grants- in their fields. That way, the school

a will give them tenure.”

“Tenure?” asked Socrates.

“That’s where if a teacher really distin-
guishes himself in his ﬁeld the university
gives him a job for life.’’

“So he can devote his time to teaching,”
concluded Socrates, wrongly. '

“Not exactly, actually this gives him time
to devote his life to research.”

“If a teacher distinguishes himself in his
field not by teaching well but by bringing
grants and money to his school, then he is
awarded tenure to continue his research,
who does do the teaching in this school?”

“Teaching assistants!” the woman

No More

By MARK A. SINDLER

Some have commented recently on the

return of individuals to whom today’s youth ,

can respectfully look for guidance and,
seemingly, leadership. The overall
argument—that yesteryear’s heroes have
returned—is weak in itself. In fact, quite the
opposite is true in contemporary society; we
are caught in situations caused by people
who think they are on a missionary crusade.
With that in mind, I propose what may
generally sum up the principles of those peo-
ple who have a total disregard for ultimate
outcomes; “the Seedy Seven Sacraments.”
The first of these is the ERA—Erratic
Rights Amendment. True, the amendment
died last June 30, but the National Organiza-
tion of Women is still continuing its breed-
ing cycle. Perhaps someday this group of
egomaniacs will find a way to strive for their
own amendment, but that is doubtful as long
as Phyllislschlaﬂey has any say on the mat-
ter. By right, she is the best thing to hit the
road since the food processor.
A woman's place is not on a pedestal or on
her hands and knees scrubbing the kitchen
-floor. Instead, she belongs in the domestic
environs raising moral and responsible
children. I’m not saying women shouldn't
work, but the problems of teenage suicide
rates, prostitution rings and hallucinogenic
mutants who pass for 15 year-olds are just
too prominent to avoid.‘
Another matter of concern that deals with
women is abortion. It really scares me when
I see pro-lifers, who think they know what is

exclaimed loudly.

“Then that’s what I’ll be,” Socrates said,
getting weary of theiconversation.

“Do you speak English fluently or have a
good grasp of a subject?” she asked.

“I sure do,” Socrates said, feeling he had
the job. .

“Then I’m afraid you don’t qualify; intelli-
gent English-speaking people usually don’t

get hired. Besides you would have to be a

Xen«ophobiaAnyone?

By JOHN TRENTES

“The problem is that we’re all too self-
conscious to even talk to‘ ‘each other,"
Tim mused as he ambled across the
street. “It seems really strange to me that
I can sit in a class of 500 students and in
15 weeks, end up speaking to only three
of them. On the other hand, why am I
talking to myself?” ~

Tim nervously glanced about just to
make sure no one has heard his rhetorical
grumblings. As, the coast was clear, Tim
continued his strangely one-sided
conversation. '

“There must be someway to break
through the ice; someone has to bethe
first to take a chance. Someone has to be
bold and take the first step.”

Tim looked around as though he were
searching for some brave soul to step
forward and volunteer. No one even
returned his gaze.

“All right then, it has to be me. From
now on, when I see a chance to lend a
hand to anyone, l’ll do it:._,I can’t be the
only one who feels this way. Perhaps this
could start a movement...”

Just then, Tim spied a welcome sight.
A lovely young lady had dropped her
class notes and was furiously ﬂailing
around in circles trying to collect them
once again.

“This is my chance to help,” thought
Tim.

“Permit me to assist you.” Tim said in
his deepest. most resonant voice. .

“Don't come any closer, or I'll bust
your knee caps!” glowered the dainty
young female. Her body tensed, ready to

\.

do damage.

Tim was taken aback for a brief
moment, not knowing quite what to do.
Then undaunted, he responded with a
thoroughly charming and witty reply:

“Huh?”

“You heard me. I know your type—
you just want to help because you’d like
to chew on my sweater. You’d better not
try anything funny.”

“Look, you’re jumping to conclusions.
I really just want to help.”

“Well, help if you want to, but watch
the hands buddy; I know Akido.” ‘

“Gesundheit,” muttered Tim dryly.

Tim proceeded to scoop up handfuls of
loose (and by now rather soggy) note-
book paper from the gently sloping,
grassy terrain. Because the chase was fast
and furious, both students soon forgot
their tense association. Bit by bit, the pair
managed to‘ bring some order to the
chaotig scattering of papers. At last, only

one lehe sheet was left on which to be
lunged. Unfortunately, both students
-lunged upon it simultaneously and
landed promptly in a tangled mess of
arms and legs.

“Oh my God!” stammered Tim. “Are
you all right?”

Tim realized after a couple of really
horrible seconds that he was not receiv-‘
ing an answer to his question. It was then
he realized that the young lady had
already bolted halfway across the lawn.

“Rape!” she screamed.

Tim sighed as he stood up and dusted
himself off.’

“I must be on the wrong planet.”

student." » .

“But wouldn’t a student be too worried
about his own subjects to be worried about
teaching?”

“There’s that possibility," she admitted
reluctantly. ‘

“It seems that the people the university
relies on to do the teaching won’t have the
time because of their own subjects to study,
and the students who expect professors to
teach them are disappointed.”

“So?” asked the clerk casually.

“But wouldn’t you agree that the purpose
of the university is to teach students?" asked
Socrates.

“Sure.”

“And that to do that, the university should
hire the best possible teachers?"_ . ..

“Obviously,” she answered, getting tired
of it all. _

“But that the best teachers at Pitt are
encouraged not to teach but to do «research
and write books about it to bring prestige to
the school.” '

“What are you trying to say?”

“That the teachers who end up teaching.

I the material are either part-time teachers
a who the students can’t get a hold of to ask
questions or teaching assistants who really ,

don’t have the time or knowledge to answer

them. It seems that the student isn’t getting

his money’s worth from the professor, since ’
he is indirectly paying the tenure!” shouted

Socrates, getting stares from bystanders.

“Look,” she said, changing the subject. “Is
there any other job you like? A desire to
teach is not enough to get a teaching job at
Pitt. Do you have any type of education?”

“I'm what you would call a professional
teacher. That’s what my education has been,
teaching people.”

“Being a good teacher won’t get you the
job either. Get a research grant,” she said
coldly. “Now we do have an opening for a
janitor at the engineering school.”

“Is that all?” asked a disappointed
Socrates.

“Or a cook at Burger Death.”

“I'll be a janitor,” he replied quickly. The
clerk handed him a broom and dustpan,
gave him directions to Benedum Hall and
closed for lunch. Socrates wasn’t bothered
about not being a teacher at Pitt, since he
actually wanted to teach, not to do research.
What did bother him though was that a
university that claimed to care about the
students’ education would want researchers, .
not teachers. Or did they ever claim to care _
about the. students‘ education? ‘

Real American“ Heroes

best, parading in front of the White House
or some state capital building. Is it right, in
our democratic nation, to shove bills
through legislatures that give congressmen
the right to determine how women must
handle pregnancy.

It is all a private matter. Let it stay that
way. No one in his right mind can declare
that prior to nine months of development, a
woman is committing murder by aborting a
pregnancy. It's her child, let her do what she
wants with it before it emerges into our
deviant world.

Speaking of deviants, we would all score a
victory over the troublemakers if Jerry Fal-
well were given solitary confinement. He’s
another hotshot who believes in making oth-
ers around him travel a narrow road because
his thinking travels along those same narrow
lines. iHe’s- against pornography on televi-
sion. He wants to make church and state one
and the same. He thinks he's guiding us out
of today’s major problems. If anything, he’s
creating more pollution.

I don’t advocate late-night cable T.V.
thrills or multitudes of glossy pages depict-
ing extraordinary body position but Falwell
is preaching about the lifestyle he lives and
how everyone must follow in step. If people
protest sex shops and such, then they should
stay away from the seedier sides of town. If a
religious experience neatly tied in with early
schooling is desired, then the students
should be sent to a parochial school.

The public school is a place to gain an
enriching education amongst people of all
races and origins. It is no place for religious
meditation. Synagogues, churches » and

mosques were built for that put A
classroom plastered with geographical
maps, students’ drawings and homework

‘assignments is no place to find a true reli-

gious experience.

This school prayer debate occupies the
fourth position on today’s list. ‘Obviously the
First Amendment gives everyone the right to
practice any religion he desires. If the state
advocates school prayer, it could mean the

 

state ‘is moving towards sanctioning some
sects or practices and outlawing others. If
the commotion over the necessity of school
prayer revolves around today’s unstable
youth, then the responsibility should not rest
on today’s teachers. As I said, this nation is
in dire need of more domestic lifestyles that
will yield more concrete foundations.
Another principle with a traditional foun-
dation is capitalpunishment. I don’t know if

« the sanctity of human life has been lost-over

the years or not, but when one human mali-
ciously murders another, the verdict should
.be clear as day. Subject that person to the
chair, to the chamber, to lethal injection or
whatever.

When that someone takes it upon himself
to end another’s life, then it should be pun-
ishable as a precedent-setting measure. This
won’t necessarily stop others from murder-
ing, but it saves the taxpayer $20,000 a year
per life sentence.

The final two ideas that permeate todayi’s
lifestyles are those of nuclear weaponry and
gun control. However, there is not that
much more to be said, so much has been
written about, lobbied for, spent on and
argued over that it is too disheartening to
discuss the establishment of one (the nuclear
age) over the demise of another (gun
control). _ -

In retrospect, there are -definitely more
clear blue seas, towering mountain ranges
and waving plains of wheat than today’s
pressing problems to mull over. It should

only be clearly stated, though, that the?

pseudo-heroes of today are realistically the
demons of yesteryear. A

The Student Health Center at Pitt
provides clinical services to the stu-
dent population that include both
general medical services, such as
treating a sore throat or upset stom-
ach and specific services, like the
treatment of acne and gynecological
problems.

Located in Brackenridge Hall, the
Student Health Center offers servi-
ces to all students who have paid
their mandatory fee of $30. Services
consist of general medical services,
internal medical services, office
surgery, dermatology treatment,

gynecological services, family plan-_

ning, allergy shots, immunizations,
health education, lab work and X-
rays.

The Health Center employs three
full-time physicians and two full-time
nurse practitioners, who have had
extensive training in the diagnostic
and treatment aspects of nursing.

They also employ seven part-time I

gynecologists and two alternates,
two part-time dermatologists, two
part-time internal medicine special-
ists and two other part-time general
practice physicians. There is also a
receptionist and cashier on duty at
all times.

“That sounds like a lot more than
it is,” said Frank Carter, director of
the Student Health Center.

The Health Center was estab-
lished in 1961. Prior to that time
there were separate student health
centers for nursing students, medical
students, men, women and athletes.
Now the services for all (except ath-
letes) are combined to form a center
that handles about 40,000 visits a
year.

To relieve some of the pressure
on the Health Center, which has
very limited facilities, a new facility
was designed to handle gynecology
and health education, including

pregnancy testing and an educa-

tional program in contraceptives
and family planning.

Thenew clinic, which opened at
the beginning of the semester and is

Reviewing Lab Work In The Hlealth Center.

located on ’ Forbes Avenue, will
relieve the Health Center of about
4,500 visits annually? 

“With the new facility, we will be
able to see more people in the same
time span with the same staff than
we are doing,” Carter said. “We are
more time efficient down there.”

With the help of funding from
Mutual Life Insurance, they are
making a series of eight films on
health-related matters for the stu-
dents at the new facility.

These films will focus on nutrition,
stress, cardio-vascular exercise,
abuse of prescription drugs, alcohol
use and abuse anddepression.

The Health Center sometimes
finds that problems are not always
physiological, so patients. are
referred to the Student Counseling
Center.

Part-time students are-also eligi-

ble for services at Student Health if .

they pay a health fee each semester
or pay for the services they receive.

One service not included in" the
health fee is the pharmacy, located
in the Health Center, which techni-

cally “belongs” to. the pharmacy‘

school and is run by second-year
pharmacy students, according to
Carter.

“It was set up in 1977 as a training
site for pharmacy students and to
provide services to (the rest of) the
students,” he said. -

The student pharmacy is non-
profit and runs on only about a 10
percent mark-up on the wholesale
price of drugs -— just what is needed
to cover the price of supplies.’

Keeping up with the times, the
pharmacy recently bought a compu-
ter that carries a complete list of the
inventory and a conﬁdential profile
of all patients and drugs they are
taking.

One common complaint about
the Student Health Center is that if a
student is ~.not conveniently sick

 

Seezox photo

between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m. on Mon- -
day through Friday, he is out of luck.
Carter finds-, however, that
extended hours would not neces-
sarily be that practical.

Out ofthe 39,000 visits ‘that the

j Health Center received last year,

about half of themwere walk-ins
with complaints of a sore‘-throat or

. stornach.ache. The number of these

visits usually dwindles as the day
comes to a close. ‘

,“fAccording to] the data we keep,
it drops drastically after eight
o’clock,” Carter said. “From what

we can see, it would probably not be ’

cost-effective to be open around the
clock.” - . .
Students interested in helping out
at the Student Health Center can
volunteer as peer contraceptive
educators, gynecology aides or
members of the Peer Medical Aid
Program or the Student Health

Advisory Board.



The Rescue

The occasional stomach ache,
viral infection or over-indulgence
of alcohol can usually be reme-
died by staying in bed and wait-
ing it out, but sometimes it is
necessary to have somplace to

sional advice or a _ride to th

gram (formerly the Wellness
Resource Center), located in
Holland Hall South, provides a
number of-services for students I
during the weekend hours when
immediate medical attention is
needed and the Student Health
Center is closed.

Most of these emergencies,
according to co-director Eleanor
Bird, are relatively minor ones
that do not require a doctor’s
attention, but some have
demanded quick action on the
part of the weekend volunteers
who staff the program.

“We’re a sort of intermediary,
if you don’t want to call the city
paramedics or the police,” Bird
said. “Since Student Health is
closed on weekends, this is
somewhere for students to go.”

In the case of someone who is
seriously ill or injured, the volun-
teers will contact the campus
police, calm the person as much
as possible and accompany him
to the hospital.

If a call comes in from one of
the dorms, the volunteers will go
to the student's room with a pre-
pared case of supplies that
includes splints, blood pressure
cuff, Ace bandages and other
emergency equipment. They do
not carry any drugs, however.

“We’re not permitted to give
the students any kind of drug,”
said Bird, “not even aspirin. But
we can recommend that they
take it on their own for colds or
something minor.”

Bird, along with co-director
Mark Smudney, heads a group
of approximately 40 volunteers
which is required to put in a min-
imum of 10 hours a month at the
center.

Most of the volunteers,
according to Bird, are sopho-

Bird and Smudney are respon-
sible not only for coordinating

supplies, but also for keeping
records of the cases and consult-
ing with a medical advisor from
student health every week.

The cases they see are some-
times serious ones, such as a
young man who called the center
complaining of severe stomach
pains. After questioning the man
and examining the list of symp-
toms that he described, the
volunteers referred him to a doc-
tor as a possible ulcer patient.
This diagnosis turned out to be -
correct.

“We see a lot of sprained
ankles and wrists,” said Bird,
“during the football season espe-
cially, when guys are out playing
in the park on Saturday and Sun-
day afternoons.”

Bird said that a surprising
number of students who seek
medical help at the center suffer
from high~blood pressure.

“We’ve been called to the
dorm when someone has a fight,-
and every once in a while, we’ll
be called for an emergency that
occurs offcampus, such as a fra-
ternity party.”

  Someone To “

-Talk To  

For those who desire help in cop-

_ing with their pressures, stress,

depression‘ or feelings, there is
assistance available on the Pitt cam-
pus. The Student Counseling Cen-
ter provides confidential one-on-one
“talk sessions” with a professional
counselor free of charge.

The services of the center are
offered to all undergraduate and
graduate students, faculty and
employees at Pitt. No information is
released to the university or to a
student’s parents without explicit
advance permission by the student.

Located in the Student Union
Building, the center has six psychol-
ogists who provide counseling servi-
ces to students for a variety of
concerns.

If at any point during the counsel-

ing a student feels uncomfortable’

with his counselor, he may request a
change of counselors.

_ Students often see counselors for
academic troubles, break-ups-with a
boyfriend or girlfriend, inabilityto
cope, sleep and study troubles,
depression, boredom with college

’ life and general feelings of anxiety.

“What we provide is as much time
as a person needs to talk these prob- V

lems out and help the person
resolve whatever the problem is,”
said Dr. Robert Gallagher, director
of the Counseling Center.

:

Counseling sessions usually last
-50 minutes, and appointments can
be arranged'a few days in advance,
but emergency cases are seen at
once.

The center generally does not do
long—term counseling and finds that
they need to see most students for
three or four sessions. In some

-cases, however, it is necessary to

see a patient for a whole term or
longer.

Gallagher. said that most fre-
quently students just need someone
to talk to—“talk therapy”—
although the center does give relax-
ation training if necessary.

He said that about half of the stu-

dents who come in for counseling‘

have a problem with a relationship
that is so upsetting for them they are
finding it difficult to work.”

Although some problems seem
/easy for some students to handle,
I’ others may not be able to cope with
' them very well. '

\ “Just because it’s not a problem
for you doesn’t mean it’s not a prob-
lem for somebody else,”>GaIlagher
said. “To some, a break-up of a

-primary relationship might b

devastating.” .

Another problem they frequently
deal with is homesickness, which is
“overwhelming” with some “new

students. —

The Counseling Center also han-
dles more serious problems, for
example, a student who must deal
with the death of a loved one.

“Our psychologists are certainly
well-trained to handle someone who
is suffering grief,” ‘he said. ’

In some cases, the center may
refer students to outside sources of
help. For example, in some rape
cases, the Counseling Center may
work with Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape or another agency

more experienced in handling it on a
regular basis. .. I

The Counseling Center sees
about a 1,000 students a year, and
the students vary widely—from
graduates to undergrads, students
having academic difficultyand 4.0
students.

The center is open from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. on weekdays and 6 to 9 p.m.
on Mondays. There is also someone

on call 24 hours to handle calls for

emergency service at night.
Gallagher said it is a healthy sign

Seezox photo

to try to handle a problem through

counseling rather than to try to,

forget it.

“Evidence -. from campus after

campus shows that some people
just can’t handle it on their own,” he

said. “People respond to stress

differently.

“We do see a number of students
each year who are seriously dis-
turbed, but we don’t want students
to feel that they have to be seriously
disturbed to come here.”

There is now a bright new
place for female students to go
with gynecological problems or
questions about family planning.

“Forbe . Clinic provides an alter-
nativ . to the Student Health
Ce‘ tter and is proving to be
beneficial both for students and
the Health Center.

“With some of the traffic being
directed down here, I hope it
should make things better at [the
Student Health Center in]
Brackenridge,” said Jan Devoe,
nurse health educator at Forbes
Clinic. “It should free up addi-
tional space there.” ‘

Forbes Clinic, which opened
early this semester and is located
by Forbes Dormitory, does
gynecological examinations and
provides contraceptive care to
all students who have paid their
health fees.

It is the policy of the clinic that
all students who receive contra-
ceptives must have an education
session first to teach them about
the various means of birth
control. 1

“We feel that if we're going t
take responsibility for the care,

   

II-"orbwes Clinic  
     New

we want the students to be able
to make educated decisions
about the method,” Devoe said.

“Basically what we do in an
education session is give them
information so they canmake
that decision.”

The information they give cov-
ers all of the methods available
through the Student Health Ser-
vices and discusses the work-
ings, advantages and dis-
advantages of each method.

Until now, they have only
been able to do this counseling
on a one-on-one basis. With the
‘new facilities, however, they
have more space to have group
sessions about contraceptives.
Devoe ﬁnds that although
some students still preferindivid-
ual counseling, many like to
come with their friends.
“I think it’s nice to be able to
offer that to students,” she said.
“We also encourage students
just to come in for a routine
gynecological appointment,” she
said. The facilities are conducive
particularly for women who have
never had an exam. ' '
Women are often embar-

rassed at their first exam and
afraid that it is going to hurt.
According to Devoe, the doctors ' =
and nurses, at Forbes Clinic are
sympathetic to these feelings.

‘If there is a need for
(contraceptive) ser-
vices, we should
offer them.’

The doctors at Forbes Clinic
can prescribe birth control pills
for a student, fit and prescribe a
diaphragm and also prescribe
and insert intrauterine devices
there.

‘Although the student’s health
fee covers the cost of the visit,
the student must still pay for the
birth control.

Pregnancy testingis available
as part of an appointment at

' able as a service to walk-ins at

Office, New Attitude «

the Health Center in Bracken-
ridge Hall.

Devoe estimates that there
are an average of 50 to 65
appointments a day for doctors’
visits and contraceptive counsel-
ing. She denies that by providing
such ready birth control, the
clinic is encouraging promis-
cuity. .

“Not all those women come in
for contraception,” she said.
“What we try to do is encourage
students to take responsibility
for their own health, and that
would include contraceptive
care.

“I think if there is a need for
these services, we should offer
them.”

Besides Devoe, Forbes Clinic
employs two-part time graduate
students who do contraceptive
counseling, a full-time nurse dur-
ing the day and a part-time nurse
in the evening. Physicians come
down from the Student Health
Center at various times.

Forbes Clinic also has two
volunteer programs: gynecologi-
cal aides, who assist the nurses
in the clinical area, and peer con-

traceptive counselors, who,
after undergoing a training ses-
sion do contraceptive coun-
seling. . ‘

Forbes Clinic is open from 9
a.m. to 9 p.m. on Monday
through Thursday, and from 9
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Friday by
appointment only.

This month, a stop-smoking
clinic is planned in the Forbes_
facilities. Future plans also
include mini-sessions for the cer-
vical mucus basal body tempera-
ture birth control method, by
which a woman knows she is
ovulating by monitoring her
temperature and watching

. changes in her cervical mucus.

Devoe is also considering hav-
ing a group sesion about pre-
menstrual tension, although this
may not be developed until the
fall semester.

The modern facilities and set-
ting gives both the employees
and patients at Forbes Clinic a
bright, positive attitude.

“It gives us a chance to grow
with the program and do ‘things
we weren’t able to before,”
Devoe said.

Panthers   Suffer Growing Pains  Big East

By SCOTT DELLETT

Ten days ago, the Panther basket-
ball team was enjoying success in the
Big East Conference. Pitt had just
upset Georgetown, the third Top 20
team to fall at the Fitzgerald Field

Ks House this season. With four games ‘

r-'-left, including two with Seton Hall
and Providence, it appeared that the
Panthers had a good chance of mak-
ing waves in the conference touma-
ment and possibly securing a
National Invitational Tournament
bid.

What a difference 10 days makes.
During this period, the Panthers
have lost to Seton Hall, Boston Col-
lege and Providence. Instead of
looking to a .500 season in confer-
ence play, Pitt is now struggling to
keep its overall record at .500—a
highly unlikely task as the Panthers
will face St. John’s before going to
New York for a possible rematch

 with Boston College.
 The question entering the mind of
' Panther fans is, what happened?
What happened to the team that had
defeated the elite of the conference
but ended up losingto a team that
had not won a conference game in
over 5 year? What happened to the
team that used to be invincible at

home but ended up losing its last ’

home game by 18 points? And‘what
happened to the team that took a
quick seven-point lead and quickly
lost it?

The answers are not clear. But
perhaps an analysis of the last week
may supply some explanations.

The upset at Seton Hall may not

 ‘be forgiveable, but it may be under-
'7" lﬂtandable. Pitt wasvcoming off an

upset over Georgetown after coming -

back from an earlier defeat. The

Pirates were winless in conference
play, and 4-19 overall. The simple
explanation of one team’s letting
down and the another team’s play-
ing over its capabilities may serve,
but head coach Roy Chipman has
warned many times about not hav-
ing an easy game in the conference.
He even said that the team wasn’t
ready to play. »
With that upset, one might have
thought that Pitt would have been
ready for Boston College. All the
intangibles were there——a
nationally-ranked team, an over-
ﬁlled Fitzgerald Field H-ouse, the

,, last home game of the season. The V
New

Panthers even came out with a quick
five-point lead. But again, Pitt col-
lapsed and the Golden Eagles’ talent
showed in an 18-point loss, the worst
Pitt has suffered since the Villanova
game in early January.

Last Monday’s game at Provi-
dence is evenmore confusing. The
Panthers again started like world-
class sprinters coming out of the
blocks, taking a 7-0 lead in the ﬁrst
three minutes. Then the spirit died as
Providence, behind the inside play
of center Otis Thorpe and the out-
side shooting of Ron Jackson,,took

 

a. 49-33 lead midway through the
second half.

Pitt finally woke up, as the excel-
lent defense and the offensive play of
Clyde Vaughan and Billy Culbert-
son started to cut the lead. An Andre
Williams l5-foot jumper tied the

v game at 69.

' But a mental mistake contributed
to the downfall of the Panthers.
After Williams’ basket, Pitt failed to
call a time-out, which kept Bryan
Mitchell and Cliip Watkins—both
quick, defense-oriented players—off

the court. The result was Jackson’s ,

ﬂying past a Panther defender for a

game-winning layup.

"All these games show that the
Panthers are not the team everyone
made them out to be, especially after
the three major upsets. Last week
proved that Pitt still has a long way
to go in order to join the top five in
the conference. ‘ .

First, Pitt needs a center badly.
This is no news, but it is one issue
that has been present throughout the

‘ season, even during the successful
times. Williams, despite the effort he ,

has put forth, doesn’t belong at that
position. Physically and emotion-
ally, the play in the league has taken
a heavy toll on the 6-8 sophomore,
whose scoring average has dipped
below double figures.,The fact that
Williams has been plagued with
injuries demonstrates that he needs
to play a forward ppsition.

Matt Miklasevich is also out of
position at center, and Keith Arm-
strong still needs more polish to face
Big East competition. Junior Steve
Beatty, a former starter at the posi-
tion, doesn’t show the aggressive-
ness necessary to succeed at center
and has been a fixture on the
Panther bench. .

* There may be some solutions next
year. One could be Jeff Robinson, a
6-10 transfer from Cincinnati.
Robinson is a natural forward but
may survive playing center thanks to
his size.

Another may come through
recruiting. A seven-foot center from
George Allen’s high school visited
the campus over the weekend and
would probably see plenty of play-
ing time were he to decide to come to
Pitt.

A second problem has been a lack '

Brian Pollock: Mr. Versatile

He’s Mr. »
Versatile

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Throughout the 1982-83 Pitt
indoor track season, Panthers
Darren Geary, Terry Gallagher,
Mario Joyner, Rick Asberry, Todd
Colas and Roger Kingdom have
been receiving most ofthe attention,
but another individual on the squad
has had a large impact on the team’s
surprising success.

Sophomore sprinter, hurdler and
sometimes middle distance runner
Brian Pollock has done more than a
credible job ‘while becoming the
-team’s “E-Man.”

“The guys call me ‘E-Man’
because I run everything,” Pollock
said. “During the indoor season, I
run in the 55-meter hurdles and the
300-, 400- and 500-meter dashes. I’m
also on the mile, the distance medley
and the shuttle hurdle relay teams.

“l think it’s great getting to run in
all of these races because it gives me
the chance to contribute to the team.
I’m only a sophomore, and for right
now, I’m happy contributing in any
way I can."

From the coaches‘ standpoint,
Pollock’s achievements have been
instrumental.

-“Brian has a very important role
on the team,” head coach John Vas-
vary said. “He is very versatile, but
at the same time, he is consistent.-

has been the only Panther taking the
responsibility of playing all-around
basketball for all 26 games this sea-
son.’ Recently, Billy Culbertson has
taken some of the burden off
Vaughan, and Trent Johnson has
been playing consistently through
the second half of the season. But
more players have to ease the pres-
sure on Vaughan.

All season, Vaughan has played
over 35 minutes per game, and since
he has emerged off the bench, John-
son has been averaging that much
time on the court. In the Big East,

By SCOTT DELLETT

In the beginning, the United
States Football League pledged to
supply an alternative to football jun-
kies during the off-season by filling
roster with players not talented
enough to perform in the National
Football League. With the signing
of several highly—touted college
players—including Heisman
Trophy winner Herschel Walker—-
the USFL has become direct compe-
tition for the NFL.

The proof came when the New
Jersey Generals signed Walker-
who still had one year of eligibility
left—to a multi-year contract
reportedly worth $16.5 million.
There’s no doubt that the new league
has established battlelines.

The USFL claims that the signing
of Walker would give the league the
credibility it needs in order to sur-
vive the first few painful years. The

league compares its getting the All-
America running back to the New
York Jets acquiring Joe Namath..
But instead of imitating the NFL, it

, ‘seems the USFL is going the route of

its immediate predecessor-—the
World Football League. '

Remember the WFL? The fluo-
rescent yellow footballs, games in
July, Merle Harmon promoting “the
new game in town." The league had
ideas similar to those the USFL is
now espousing. But most of all, the
WFL was ready to challenge the
NFL. It signed such starsas Larry
Csonka, Paul Warfield and Danny
White, to name a few.

The WFL appeared to be a legiti-

mate threat at first. Teams were‘

drawing well and games were fairly
exciting. Football in July seemed
like it would succeed. ‘
Then the truth came up. The so-
called huge attendance was phony.
As many as 50,000 people came in

free. And the owners werelosing

Mets could lose games. The only

their uniforms repossessed for not
paying their bills.

A, new administration tried to
clean up the WFL but to no avail.
The WFL, which came into the
world with horns and fanfare, died
quietly.

Now the NFL is being challenged
again, this time with a new league
with an unique concept—football in
March. Originally, the league’s
plans were modest—holding play-
ers’ salaries to a minimum of $2 mil-
lion. But, as John Steinbeck said,
the best laid plans of mice and men
usually go astray.

First, the Washington Federals
signed Southern Methodist running
back Craig James to a multi-year
contract. Reggie Collier, Kelvin
Bryant, Tom Ramsey and Tim
Spencer soon followed James’ lead.
These players would have been high

choices in the NFL draft in April,
but for either not wanting to wait or
not willing to move into a different
position, they took the money and
ran. -

There have been critics who said

the USFL was luring players away

from the middle of the academic
year. But promises of the team pay-
ing the player’s tuition until he grad-
uated quieted the critics.

With‘ the signing of Walker, an
underclassman, there is pressure
being applied in many places. If the
league made an exception to its pol-
icy of not signing underclassmen for
Walker, why can't it make an excep-
tion for other players? What if a
team in need of offensive linemen
offers the big bucks to Bill Fralic?
What does this do to collegiate
athletics?

Before, the league set a limit in
players’ salaries. Walker’s salary
surpasses those of eight teams total
in the league. The owners with more

"financial resources can go into their

wish.

This brings up another point-
parity. In order for a new league to
survive, the teams must be fairly
close together in talent. One bad
‘team means no fans and hence one
less team in the league. Thus, the
rich get richer and the poor get
poorer. ’ ‘A A p

And what about the chancesiffgy
expansion teams? If the established
teams have such an imbalance of tal-
ent, there’s little chance that a new
team can survive. It’s widely known
that Pittsburgh—a city that is
pegged for possibly going into the
league in l984—wil1 not support a
losing team. A

Even without the Walkers’ sign-
ing, the league would have had a

tough time succeeding. The USFL .

seemed to be on the right track, with
the publicity by the owners and the
rich television contracts by ABC and
ESPN. But with the signing of
Walker, the league may have signed
its death certificate. C '

‘Leading the disabled list is fresh-

While there is no good time for an
injury, they probably couldn‘t have
come at a better time—the Lady
Panthers are in a break between
indoor and outdoor track season
and their next meet isn’t scheduled
until the middle of April.

This break may be used for recup-

puts the injured girls who can’t run,_

such as Torre, on a program to
maintain their cardiovascular
ﬁtness. '

Kennedy knows that injuries are
part of the sport and that the only
thing to do is try to avoid them and
whenthey do occur, get the athlete
proper treatment.

\

For the good of team, and for
Kennedy’s sanity, hopefully the girls
will recover quickly and completely
and the barrage of casualties will
come to an end. "

Then again, it can’t get much
worse. There aren’t too many Lady

I “We have confidence in running
Brian anywhere from the 55-meter
hurdles all the way up to the 800-

I _ meter run. His best event could be

the 400-meter intermediate hurdles
[an outdoor event]. Coach [Steve]
Lewis feels that he has unlimited
potential in that event.”

Although he is competing in many
different events, Pollock is not a

, stereotypical team contributor.-The
‘two-time high school ‘All-America
A from Chester, Pa., currently holds

four school records for his efforts in

the 300- and 400-meter dashes and
the shuttle hurdle and mile relays,

He has also qualiﬁed for the Inter-

-collegiate Amateur Athletic Associ-

ation of America (IC4A)
championships, to be held this week-
end, in four different events—the-
400- and 500-meter dashes andthe
distance medley and mile relays.

I.

At the Big East championships,
two weeks ago, Pollock won the 300-
meter dash and set the champion-
ship record (34.74) while competing
in the 55-meter hurdles and third
place with the mile and distance

medley relay teams.

This weekend he will run the 500-
meter dash. It will be his only indi-
vidual event at the IC4A meet, but
he could compete in any of three
relay events—the mile, the distance
medley or the two mile.

“In ihe‘500-meter run, there will
be tough competition, but it will be
the same guys from Big East meet,”
Ponock said. “Craig Morris of Vil-
lanova and Washington. Nigeri of
Seton Hall will be there, and they are
very competitive. I think I should be
able to qualify for nationals in the
500, and our mile relay should have
a very good shot at it also,”. he said.

The_Pitt News, Wednesday Mar"ch,j2,' 

Though Pollock has turned in
some stellar performaces, he isn’t
about to take all the credit himself.

“The coaches told us at the begin-
ning of the year that if we wanted to
run well as a team, then we would
have to form a family atmosphere,"
he said. “It's totally different from
last year- Coaches Lewis and Vas-
vary have been like my fathers away
from home; Mario [Joyner] and
Ricky [Asberry] have_ been like my
big brothers. It means a lot to me
and the whole team.”

When he decided to come to Pitt
two years ago, it wasn’t because of
the team's spirit or even the tradition
of success that had once been char-
acteristic of Pitt track.

“I was ‘recruited by Virginia, Flor-
ida, VMI, Tennessee, Arizona and
Pitt,” he said.‘ “I'm from the city and
when I made my visit to Pitt, I was
attracted to the city life.

“Another, and probably the most
important, contributing factor in my
signing with Pitt was that there
appeared to bea real commitment to
the student part of student-athlete. I-
also thought I would get a chance to
run as a freshman, whereas at the
other schools, I would have had to
go through a waiting period because
of all the outstanding upper-
classmen.”

Right now he believes the right
decision was made.

“The program has turned around
completely this season,” he said.
“This year, Pm‘ running for the
seniors, but by the time I’m a senior,
we will be in the top 10 in the coun-
try. Next year, we have ashot at the
Big East championship. It’s just very
exciting.”

The turning-around on the track

‘ has been coupled with a turn-around

off the track, where Pollock also
appears to be onsolid ground.

as Pifi Wednesday Mac}. 2, 1983

By MARK A. SINDLER

You can smell it in the air. The
rites of spring were officially admin-
istered yesterday when spring train-
ing opened for all 26 major-league
baseball teams from the southern-
most reaches of Arizona to the Key
West sector of Florida. The har-
mony of bats cracking and catcher
mitts thudding always mean a fresh,
warm season can’t be too far behind.
Accordingly, ‘every spring train-

* ling brings with it fresh expectations

\

f‘

and newfaces ondifferent ballclubs
as a result of off-season wheeling
and dealing. Indeed, even the scent
of freshly-cut outfield grass makes it
more enjoyable. Several points can
already‘ be brought out about the
pre-baseball season rituals that play-
ers go through to shed those steak-
potato beer meals theyfve indulged
in since last October.

First, -Billy Martin is back at the
helm of the always-intriguing New
York Yankees. Not only has Martin
been fired three times by the same
team, but the same owner has been
involved each time. I suppose owner

‘ ~;George Steinbrenner ran out of
- patience with the rotating managers

Bob Lemon and Gene Michael.
The Yankees have gone since 1978
without a world championship, so
George III resorted to perhaps the
last possible solution: rehire Martin.
Provided that George III stays away
from threatening elevators and that
' Martin keeps his distance from bois-
terous marshmallow salesmen, the
Yankee’s clipper ﬂeet just may out-
steam all other pretenders and be the
American League’s East contender.
Just from a financial standpoint,
it has to. George III has more than a
kingfs ransom at stake in his “multi-
billion” ’dollar asset. Money, in this

._v giase, ought to buy George 111 what-
‘ ver he wants. ‘

I

3 gt

Money, no matter how much,
could never buy the confidence that
Pittsburgh Pirate manager Chuck

wwewaawawwew

Tanner has in himself. Just the other
day, it could be overheard that his
Pirate squad is in the top four East-

" ern Division teams he considers pos-
sible playoff-contenders._ That’s the
thing with Tanner, he never loses the
optimism.

Whether the Pirates are indeed
contenders for playoff competition
is seriously doubtful. The Bucs lost
Omar Moreno over the winter to
Houston, thus taking away their
lineup-leadoff speed around the
bags. Pitcher Jim Biddy is coming

off a rehabilitation year forced upon
him by rotator cuff surgery about
one year ago. Besides, he’s 38 years
old and about ready for retirement.
Rick Rhoden, another mound start-
er, is in his early 30’s, but hasn’t been
consistent since coming from the
Dodgers four years ago.

Just about the only interesting
aspect of the Pirates -pre-season to
date is Dave Parker’s showing up for
spring training on time, pretty much
on equal terms with the press, and it
should be interesting to see whether

. ,._,,Sta rt Of Baseball   First‘ Sign Of Spring

Pirate ownership eventually signs
Parker after his ﬁve-year bank note
expires this October. Interesting,
because of Warner Corp., that cable
conglomerate that has interests in
just about every business aspect in
this country except fertilizer.
Warner recently bought 48 per-
cent of the Pirates and added a huge
infusion of money. What will make
Parker’s potential inking of a new
contract interesting is Warner’s big
bank account, Parker’s performance
this season and whether other teams

find the urge to stretch out their
money-laced ﬁngers, making Parker
a free agent. Stay tuned. -

One notable aspect of baseball for
which it has been worth staying
tuned is that of Houston Astros’
pitcher J .R. Richard's saga. It was
only July 1981 when Richard was
throwing some batting practice and
he suffered a near-fatal stroke.
Richard had previously been com-
plaining of constant chest pains for

sometimes the national—-press kept

trashinghim for allegedly lackadais- 

i‘éal"play.
Well, Richard wasn’t laying
games, as the stroke indica . After

a year and a halFs rehabilitation,
Richard spent a lot of time in the
Latin. American leagues and in
Houston’s Triple A farm club during
last year. This should be a pivotal
year for Richard—will he ever again
pitch for the major leagues?

One finalpoint worth looking

Padres.

‘I wonder how. Garvey will adjust

some time there recently, I found
that just about the only thing nota-
ble about the ' is its zoo and Sea
World. Yet arvey—with his

San Diego has never had a winner—

but the Padres alw finish their
