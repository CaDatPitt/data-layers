Way to   clean up Carbon

by Michael Macagnone
Staﬂ Writer
Pitt professor Valerian Kagan,
associate professor Alexander Star
and a team of graduate students dis-
covered that they can use an enzyme
called horseradish peroxidase, which

- is common-in many plants and es— _

pecially in horseradish, to break up

. potentially toxic carbon nanotubes

and transform them into carbon
dioxide. ‘

Carbon nanotubes, a synthetic

form of carbon developed in the

last decade, are used in‘ electronics
and some medical products, said
Kagan, vice chair of the department
of- environmental and occupational
health in the Graduate School of

Public Health.  single layer of car- '
bon atoms is rolled into a cylinder
to form these tubes, and this unique
shape gives the tubes special ‘prop— ,
erties. The tubes are hollow, 
‘them very light. Their cylindrical
shape makes them stronger than

’ steel, said Kagan.

The tubes are used as semi_con- ,
ductors and can readily detect cer-
tain chernicals, said  _

Star, an associate. professor of
chemistry in the ‘School of Arts
and Sciences, developed a proce-
dure that allows doctors to use these
tubes to predict an asthma attack A
More than 400 consumer products ‘
worldwide use these nanotubes,
said  The applications for
these nanotubes have grown expo-

-nentially in the past several years, he

added. _ .
The researchers discovered that
if they exposed the enzyme andithe
diluted hydrogen peroxide to the
nanotubes, the enzyme would react
to form a product that oxygenizes
the carbon in the nanotube, ‘form-
ing carbon dioxide, said Brett Allen,

a third—year graduate student who’ I

worked_on the research. _

' ‘Previously, the only way research-
ers could break up the nanotubes
was by  high concentrations
of acid.- A ' P _

i  called the discovery “a

_ very green chemistry.”

Allen discovered the proportions
for the solution that ﬁnally broke up
the nanotubes using a concentration

. But, Wanamaker, a ‘sophomore

has steadily shown Dixon that he
belongs on the court.

Dixon already knew that he
could depend on redshirt sopho-

heading into the year. Wanamak-
er has’ since made that question
mark disappear. And along with
Brown, the two are making a big
difference for the No. l—ranked
Panthers off the bench. ,
“We’ve just been keeping, up,

Wanamaker. “We’re getting really

Vandals

Splattered red paint across ‘the
front steps of the Islamic Center
of Pittsburgh didn’t stop Oakland’s
Muslim community from worship
last Friday. I

People still attended their

‘morning services. Neighbors con-

demned the vandalism to the Oak-,
land mosque, which sits above Pitt’s

I campus in the Schenley Farms His-

toric District. ’

Imam Abdusemi, a leader. of '

the center, said the ‘community
knew little about who could have
Vandalized the Islamic Center.

“All that we know is that on
Friday morning, early, around 6
a.m. when we got there for morn-
ing prayers, there was a lot of paint
at the main entrance of the build-

ing,” said Abduserni. “We have no I

Room hosts students
for prayers, questions

Prayer Room, page 1

\Welcome to the Muslim Student Associations
prayer room, a space used solely for prayer, reflec-
tion and meditation

“There was a demand for this [room],” said the
association’s president, Melek Yazici. “Before, we
had to prayin hallways oremptyclassrooms——if
we could ﬁnd one We didn’t like to pray in front of
people in hallways’ ’ ' V

Followers of Islamic faith pray ﬁve times each
day. This can pose a problem for students 
to and from classes, Yazici said They might not be
able to travel bad< to their room to pray privately
each day The new prayer room provides a place
for students to stop at their convenience, between
the hours of noon and 5 pm. daily.

“Some students can’t getto the mosque, it was
important to have something on campus,” said
Yazici, a senior who says the group is grateful to
have its own space

While the room has minimal decor, pious fol-
lowers bring their own prayer rugs, but the room is
carpeted for those without them.

Yazici said she stopped by the room three days
aweektopraylastsemester Students eanusethe
room at their own convenience, she said

Because Islam follows a lunar calendar, prayer

times change in accordance with the sun’s position.
In the winter, the room is open for two of the ﬁve
prayer times: noon and early 

Yazici said both devout Muslim and converts on
campus have used the room.

“There were some students from Saudi Arabia
thatwereinterested,aswellas afewgirls fromMa—
laysia,’ ’ said Yazici.

But the room is open to everyone

“It’s important to know you don’t have to be a
Muslim to use the too ” said Yazici. “You can
pray, meditate, whatever”

Sultan Ghuman, a Pitt sophomore at Pitt and
Muslim Student Association member, said he uses

' the room about once a day.

“The mosque is a 15-minute walk away and its
better to pray there, but the Union is easier than
walking to my room,” said Ghuman. “Last year I
would walk all the way to Lothrop to pray in my
room” -

He also said the room is excellent for commut-

ers who might not be able to go home during the

afternoon. _ I

“W/ord hasn’t really gotten around about it yet
and some people think it’s a hassle, but I think it’s
a good idea,” said Ghuman. “Carnegie Mellon has
a prayer room. I think it’s important for a school
this size”

threats.

“Right now, we really have nothing to go
on,” said Richard.

The vandalism occurred as violence es-
calated in the Middle East, speciﬁcally the at-
tacks between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza
area.

Both Palestinians and Israelis were killed
as a result of the Gaza attacks.

Abdusemi said those at the Islamic Cen-
ter did not believe the violence caused some-
one to vandalize the mosque.

“We have no proof of that kind of con-
nection,” he said. “We do not make any con-
nection between the two.”

Abdusemi said there was no reaction
from the Muslim community, except for sur-
prise.

“Gladly, it did not affect our services,” he
said. “Our services went ﬁne, and there was
no actual concern on our parts.”

He said the Islamic center felt gratitude
toward the North Oakland neighborhood
for its support.

“[They] gave us full support in condemn-
ing such an act. Many of our neighbors
came out of their home and showed their
concern,” said Abdusemi.

“Many of them called or sent letters or
came out personally,” Abdusemi added.

“Hopefully we can keep living in such a
peaceful neighborhood as Oakland.”

Pitt student Melek Yazici, president of
the Muslim Students Association, said that
she was surprised when she heard about the
vandalism after reading an e—mail distributed
by the center. V

“As Muslims, we are trying to promote
religious tolerance, and we are really work-
ing to create an atmosphere in Pittsburgh
for greater understanding of religions,” said
Yazici.

We are just regular people living in this coun-

 

ter, I wasn’t expecting it, personally. I don’t
think anyone was,” Yazici added.

Yazici said that she wasn’t sure what the
reasoning was, although she’d heard specula-
tions about the rising tension in the Middle
East. '

She said that, in general, this is a hard
time for Muslims in the United States.

“Maybe it’s the kind of image they have
of Muslims as bad people,” said Yazici. “We
are working on changing that image of Mus-
lims as being terrorists or being bad people.

try, facing the same kinds of problems.”

Yazici said that the Pitt community usu-
ally tolerates diversity.

“I am a person who wears a head scarf,”
said Yazici. “Sometimes, I get those looks.
But in general, people are nice. They try to
understand people from different religions
and background.

“If people have questions in mind about
Islam or Muslims, I think they should just
ask the people they know that are Muslim,”
said Yazici. “That’s the best way to learn
about religion.”

Saturday, 8 p.m.

Free with Pitt ID

Pitt’s music department will
bring experimental music to the

New York’s best avant—garde musi-
cal artists to the Andy Warhol Mu-
seum Saturday night.

New York City's Sirius Quartet warms up before performing its string-ﬁlled, experimental and avant-garde music. It will open Elliott Sharp this Saturday.

on the Edge program will present
its first concert of the year with ex-
penmental musicians Elliott Sharp
and the Sirius String Quartet

Dedicated to bringing students
contemporary music performed by
professional musicians, Music on
the Edge hosts about six concerts
each year.

“The focus of this series is to
display contemporary classical mu-
sic that is both wntten and impro-

vised,” said Mathew Rosenblum,

co-director of the Music on the

Edge program.

Both Elliott Sharp and the Siri-
us String Quartet are accomplished
musicians who compose and per-
form within the realm of avant—
garde musical constructs.

A staple in the New York City
avant-garde scene for more than
thirty years, Sharp personiﬁes the
genre. He pioneered the application
of transforming fractal geometry,
chaos theory and genetic metaphor
into compositions.

“Sharp is known for high vol-

ume, complex ‘noise’ based music,”
said Rosenblum.

The concert will also feature the
US. debut of two new works, “Mo—
mentum Anomaly’ ’ for solo 
and “Volpak” for  and string
quartet, both composed by Sharp.

Blending the structure of clas-
sical and energy rock ’n’ roll, the
Sirius Suing Quartet is a two-head-
ed monster: half string quartet and
half rock band. Its inﬂuences in-
clude classical, rock, jazz and other
popular styles.

Varying its repertoire as much
as its genre, the quartet plays both‘
acoustically and with electronic ef-
fects. This group of highly skilled
musical improvisers truly pushes
the limits of string instruments.

As an added bonus for Pitt
music program graduate students,
both Elliott Sharp and the Sirius
Suing Quartet will be performing
and critiquing select student com-
positions in a private session prior
to the concert

“Elliott Sharp and the Sirius

String Quartet offer an interest-
ing perspective on contemporary
classical music through their incor-
poration of improvisation,” said
Rosenblum. “They represent a dif-
ferent type of music we won’t hear
in Pittsburgh that mu .”

Tickets can be purchased in ad-
vance through ProArts tickets, $10
for general admission or $5 for stu-
dents and seniors. Tickets are $15

Neil Young gives fans an
intimate musical experience

Staﬂ Writer

Sugar Mountain —
Live at Canterbury House 1968

Reprise Records
Rocks Like:
Bob Dylan turned inside out

r Live recordings of a solo
 Neil ‘Young and his
acoustic  provide
a glimpse into the mo-
ment before the music of

 

the now—legendary musician exploded into the
world on the newly released Sugar Mountain —

~ Line at Cantenbugl House 7968.

Young fans will appreciate the way the
acoustic and early versions of familiar songs give
a new perspective on these touchstone tunes, as
well as the rare songs that they will discover on
the album. But listeners don’t have to be estab-
lished Young fans to know this is just a good
live album. The raw, delicate sadness with which
Young sings the trademark personal and twist-
ing lyiics of his songs intimately into the rnicro—
phone is both  and haunting.

Neil Young releases old ‘a

concert album from 1968

Neil Young, page 8

The album’s solo acoustic performance cap-
tures a moment in Youngs career when he took
the deep inﬂuence of Bob Dylan and moved it

‘ toward his own unique drama and in—your-face

method of constructing songs It’s almost possi-
ble to hear Young searching his soulas he sings.

On “Last Trip to Tulsa,” Young winds
through a lyrical journey of ambiguous identity
and his falsetto moans through the song, like a
Dylan song that Young turned inside out and is
beginning to make his own.

i The album’s clear, fresh sound is the raw
root upon which Young continued to layer and
develop his sound over the years.

When he played this concert, itwas 1968 and
the 22-year-old Young had just split with Buffalo
Spnngﬁeld and would soon put out his debut
solo album Neil Young. ' t

Performed solo at Canterbury House in
Ann Arbor, lVlich., the concert is a portrait of a
talented artist teetering on the edge of his musi-
cal creation I

are a delightful insight into how Young originally
imagined some of his original tunes.

One of the album’s best treats is its acous-
tic version of “Mr. Soul,” which was one of
Young’s touchstone songs over the years

Often, he plays “Mr. Soul” as a  rock
song, but the album’s acoustic version reveals a
more melancholy perspective on the tune and
allows it to be heard with fresh ears.

- The intimacyof the performance is 
While Young’s lyrics have always been very per-
sonal, this album plays like to intimate expen-
ence shared between you, the microphone, an
acoustic  and Young’s voice.

 a twinge of innocent sadness, Young’s
falsetto ﬂoats over his lyrics on this album even
more than on any other, like a lonely balloon set

. loose to wander across a cloudless blue sky.

- Signs of Young’s independence and eccentric
charm are already apparent in his performance,

in the effortless way he flows through the songs 7

and in the anecdotes he shares between songs.
It’s hard to tell if there’s any truth to them, but

'The Day the Earth Stood Still‘

doesn't make an impression

Earth, page 8
ences’ inner Green Peace soldier.

The movie starts out following the hottest
microbiologist Earth has to offer, Helen Ben-

son Gennifer Connelly), a great candidate to‘

prove to alien Klaatu’s (Keanu Reeves) human
body that there is something worth saving here.

Everything is pretty normal in Benson’s life '

until government agents show up at her house
demanding that she come with them because

an asteroid is spiraling toward Manhattan and‘

bringing with it inevitable doom.

But alas, it’s just Reeves in another merely
adequate role of Klaatu, accompanied by his
40-foot giant robot bodyguard equipped with
an ever-handy “kill all humans” button.

All Klaatu wants to do is speak before the
United Nations and tell humanity that it is go-
ing into the wood chipper, but Secretary of

Defense  Jackson (Kathy Bates) would’

rather probe. the alien a little longer and aggra-
vate it , 4 _ V

Eventually, the less—than—heroic team of
Klaatu and.Benson escape the facility and ﬁnd
themselves  through the marshes of
New Jersey and  around in Benson’s eco
ﬁiendly Honda, because Benson is of course
not part of the problem.

Klaatu’s mission is to activate glowing
spheres, which will take away all of the animals
on Earth so that they will be safe when the giant
robot ﬂips its kill switch,  it into a swarm
of metallic murderous locusts _

The locust scene is perhaps the coolest in
the movie, as we get to watch the critters shred

a contingent of the army and then proceed to '
rip apart the wonders of America, such as a

trucker’s  and a football stadium.

The movie ultimately falls somewhere in the
category of extreme mediocrity.

“The Day the Earth Stood Still” is an enter-
tainingand action packed movie that  suing
you along well enough to make you forget that
you could have seen something else with a little
more substance

But again, the key word here is 

oAHLAﬂo 

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 

This movie was not made to try and inﬂuence ' ’ "
the world. At the end of the day, there is no real ‘ii I
deﬁning moments in cinema history that are
made here, unlike the original Version of the
film, and as a result we are obviously let down
a little ’

The movie also ends on a note of “never
mind,”  that  might be rough for
the Earth now, but everything will be okay be-
cause a hot scientist will come along and save
us all._

Comfort level soars
for Wanamaker

Bench, pagel

During Pitt’s win against Rutgers — a
game that Pitt trailed by as much as ﬁve with
10 minutes remaining — \X/anamaker came
through with his best game ever as a Panther.

. In 22 minutes the guard scored a career-high

15 points on 4—of-7 shooting from the field,
knocked down 5-of—6 free throws, added ﬁve
rebounds and had four assists. Brown had 11
points and four rebounds.

It’s those performances that earn a player
more and more minutes as the year goes on.

“[Brown] and Bradley have been tremen-
dous,” said Dixon. “It’s really comforting to
know [that] ﬁve minutes into the game we
can throw in Bradley and Gilbert They know
what they’re in there to do.”

“We need to come in and make plays,”
said Wanamaker.

After averaging 12.5 minutes through
the ﬁrst seven games of the season, Wana-
maker has increased his playing time to nearly
20 minutes per game in the last seven. He’s
shooting 47 percent on the year (14 percent
better than he shot last year) and 40 percent

against Rutgers last week.

from the 3-point line (he shot 17 percent last
season). He also increased his free-throw
shooting percentage by 25 and has more
points and more rebounds 14 games into the
season than he did through the entirety of
last year. —

“[It’s] just conﬁdence,” said \X/anamaker
after scoring ﬁve points in a win at George-
town. “I just keep going at it, getting better
every game and gaining more conﬁdence.”

Brown agreed. \While his scoring average
is up just slightly from last season (about half
a point), he’s learning to become more of a
scorer. As one of the most athletic players on
the team, that’s what Dixon said he wants to
see.

“Coach told me I need to be more aggres-
sive,” said Brown. “That’s what I’m going to
do.”

But it’s more than just numbers that the
team wants to see from Brown and Wana-
maker. It’s the overall chemistry between the
players on the court and the comfort level
with each player. V ‘

Sam Young, Pitt’s leading scorer and All-
American candidate, said that when those two
are on the floor, the team is so comfortable
that it doesn’t need to change anything about
what it’s doing. He added that the talent on
the bench can deﬁne how a team produces
down the stretch of the season. It gives op-
posing teams a different look and doesn’t al-
low it to get comfortable with just the starting
ﬁve’s arsenal.

“I think it’s great what coach is doing,” said
Wanmnaker. “For those minutes every game
the [other team’s player] is seeing a different
defender and a different offensive player.”

Last season, Pitt (1 4—0, 2-0 Big East) had
to dip into its bench often to ﬁnd scoring and
defense, as both Cook and guard Levance
Fields were out with injuries. At that time,
Brown and guard Keith Benjamin stepped
into the roles;

Team chemistry still
strong with bench players

in the ﬁrst 12 games, Benjamin did it 14 times
in the last 23.

Brown, a freshman at the time, hit double
ﬁgures nine times in that stretch after doing
it just twice before. So it’s obvious that Pitt
counts on those bench players to be ready at
any time.

Young said that if Brown or \X/anamaker
were asked to step up into a starting role this
year, it wouldn’t be a problem.

“I think we have great chemistry, it shows
how much of a complete team we have,” said
Young. “I think when a lot of guys look at
our team and rank us, they don’t look at the
bench players. They don’t pay attention to the
guys that come off the bench who are big
contributors and make us so successful.”

Pitt center Dejuan Blair agreed.

“That’s the thing about this team,” said
Blair. “When somebody is down, another
person can step up.”

Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt football program gained a lot
of momentum and generated optimism
during its most successful regular season
since 1981. But some of those positive sen-
timents were negated by Pitt’s embarrassing
offensive performance during its first bowl
visit under coach Dave Warmstedt.

Now, with the season completed, the
Panthers have left their fans with a number
of topics to chew on throughout the off-
season. Here’s an abbreviated look at this
past season and a short glimpse into the
program’s future.

Statistical Leaders

Standout sophomore tailback LeSean
McCoy led the Panthers in all rushing
categories. McCoy ﬁnished with 21 touch~
downs and 1,488 yards on- the ground.
Behind McCoy, senior LaRod Stephens-
Howling rushed for 312 yards and five
scores.

Quarterback Bill Stull ﬁnished the year
with 330 pass attempts. The redshirt junior
accumulated 2,356 yards passing and ended
with a completion percentage of 57. Stull
reached the endzone through the air nine
times and was picked off 10.

Stull’s favorite receiver — senior Derek
Kinder -— led the Panthers in receptions
with 36 for 422 yards. Kinder tied true
freshman Jonathan Baldwin with three
receiving touchdowns.

For the second year in a row, middle
linebacker Scott McKillop led the Panther
defense in tackles, netting 137 total stops
this year. Safety Dom DeCicco pulled in
four interceptions, giving him more picks
than anyone else on the Pitt roster.‘ A

Conor Lee converted 20—of—24 field goal
attempts and finished his career a perfect
113 for 113 in point-after-touchdowns. Se-
nior Dave Brytus punted the ball 60 times
for an average of 40.7 yards.

During a teleconference call earlier in
the week, Warmstedt told reporters that he
expects McCoy to skip the NFL Draft in
April and return for his junior season. The
issue, however, is not official. If he decides
to, McCoy has until Jan. 15 to enter the
Draft.

\X/annstedt endorsed often criticized
offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh '

both as a play-caller and quarterback coach.

staff to return next year, unchanged.

Quarterbacks Kevan Smith and Greg
Cross are facing possible changes next year.
The coaches are considering Smith at tight
end and Cross at safety. '

Meanwhile, freshman defensive back
Ronald Hobby was dismissed from the
Panthers. He did not make the trip to the
Sun Bowl.

 

Starting offensive tackle Jason Pink-
ston had an MRI earlier in the week to
determine whether the shoulder injury he
suffered prior to the Sun Bowl will require

surgery.

Nate Byham, Pitt’s starting tight end, "34 _.

has been slated to have shoulder sur-
gery sometime this week and freshman

, cornerback Jarred I-Iolley will undergo an

arthroscopic knee procedure.

Pitt hoping new _
recruits can step 1n

schools are making their last big push in

the world of recruiting. Uncommitted
prospects are getting the “ful1—court press”
treatment from coaching staffs. Here’s a
look at some of the highly rated prospects
from whom Pitt has received verbal com-
mitments and a couple other recruits whom
the Panthers have yet to land.

Committed:

Brock DeCicco (TE): Dom’s younger
brother helped his Thomas Jefferson team
to a state title this year. The 6—foot—5 tight
end needs to fill out a bit but already has
soft hands and playmaking ability.

Tyrone Ezell (DL): Ezell is a physical
specimen who should become a terror to
offensive lines once he’s polished.

jack Lippert (DL): Lippert was a force
to be reckoned with this past season at
Central Dauphin High School.

Todd Thomas (ATH): The only Pitt
recruit to receive four stars according to
both Scout.com and Rivals.com, Thomas is
already familiar with Heinz Field from his
trips to the WPIAL playoffs.

Uncomrnitted:

Dan Mason (LB): After missing out
on Ohio State—bound Dorian Bell, the
Panthers have been focused on bring-
ing in Mason, another touted prospect at
linebacker. Mason is scheduled to Visit Pitt
this weekend.

Kolby Gray (QB): With shaky play from
the quarterback position this year, bring-
ing in a dual—threat gunslinger from Texas
doesn’t sound like such a bad idea.

Young Players to Watch: Shayne I-Iale
(DE, Fr.), Cam Saddler (WR, Fr.),]arred
Holley (CB, F11), Antwuan Reed (CB, Ft),
Chris Burns (RB, Fr.), Shariff Harris (RB,
So.)
