   Editorial: Mm of Good Will

.a.

L»

No one who was here ﬁve years ago would believe it if we told
them that students are actually ﬁghting to be active, that once dormant
groups are actually crossing lines into other areas in their enthusiasm to
do for the students.

These great, green ﬂurries of energy are particularly evident in
the men’s organizations such as Men’s,iCouncil,now rejeuvenated into an
orientation program and Men’s DormiCounciI which liasitaken to, spon-
soring picnics for the entire University community?’ Even Student
Union Board is planning a booklet presenting various students organiza-
tions and encouraging participation.

” The result is a maze of good will. V

The Dean of Students Oliice orients freshmen as does the Dean of.

Women’s Ofﬁce, which would naturally cause no conﬂict. But Men’s

Council under the Dean of Men has started a/ separate program which-

has decentralized orientation handling. And the Student Union Board
- has its foot in the door with orientation entertainment ‘like the Gateway

Clipper. . , . * . _ It
At present Student Government publically, sponsors the oﬂicial

I I Student Handbook, the Polaris, -as well as the Student Directory when

in fact both are directed through the Office of Student Publications. The

$-

Polaris even shares an office with The Pitt News photography staff. Now
the Student Union as well has taken to journalism and is crossing func-
tions with the Polaris.

Even further, in the social sphere, AWS and Men’s Dorm Council
have moved from their own speciﬁc groups to entertaining the whole
school -—— through picnics, through lectures, through parties,'through
movies, ‘all strangely similar to the affairs the Student Union Board
programs. ' »

These obvious conﬂicts of interest and duplications of efforts need’

an immediate rechanneli_ng into deﬁned areas of activity for each organ-
ization. This is a new problem that comes with growing student interest.
At one time it was the challenge of activating organizations. Now it is
organizing them.

We need a separation of powersnow — in a sense, a hierarchy of '-

responsibility among student organizations. The University is ready for a
true Student Government. ' I

If the students want-re’cognitio‘;1_if‘as a group let them organize into .1’

one. If the students want respect as a’ force, let thernigprove themselves

worthy by internal strength. An overhauling, a'_rech.-anneling, and then 1?:

watch out.

Editor, The Pitt News:
Open Doors for the Handi-

- capped is a Pittsburgh organi-

zation composed of both able-

’ bodied'and handicapped adults
' ‘ working on a variety of pro-

grams to increase the independ-
ence of the handicapped. Our

organization promotes opportuni— .
. ties for the maxim participation

ol:' the physically handicapped in

all areas (particularly education, -

employr’nen,t, a n d. recreation)»
and to offer preventive and cor-
rective assistance in ﬁelds of

' physical restoration.

The main purpose of our or-
ganization is contacting archi-
tects and building owners about
the need for constructing build-

, ings with the handicapped and

aged in mind. Some practical
suggestions are level or ramped
entrances, doorways at least 32
inches wide, swinging doors in-

, stead of. revolving ones, etc.

The editorial and two other
articles in The Pitt News of May
27', 1964 were brought to our at-
tention. '

We wonder that if the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh can afford all
the new buildings they are put-
ting up, why can’t they ﬁnd
enough money.to lower the side-

I walk curbs at a number of places

for the handicapped students?
Surely someone with enough
initiative could_obtain permission
from city ‘= officials and obtain

‘non-University funds. The Uni-

versity oﬁicials have enough ini-
tiative to get money and grants

' for other projects in which they

are interested.

About Vietnam Solution

ists, helped Vietnam get its inde-
pendence in August of 1945.

The French persistence in
considering Vietnam a colony,
and a poor independence treaty
denying the right to an embassy,
led to the oﬂicial declaration of
war on December 6, 1946.

Tran Van Dinh said that if you
saw the movie How the West Was
Won you can understand how the
war in Vietnam could bewon by
the same. people in 24 hours.

Not being Hollywood ﬁction the
war in Vietnamdemands that the
population back the government
and according to Tran Van Dinh
“there is "only one remedy-——we
must create a militant class” to
ﬁght for what they believe.

Looking at the Vietnamese war"
from a standpoint other than that
of a militant class, an American
should question and think for him-
self. The AA,m'eri_can_ lives in a
country vwhich hasn’t- taken a
stand,‘ and which‘ until 1954, didn’t
-realize the importance of Asia.

But Vietnam realized that it
needed a “clean and honest” gov-
ernment according to Tran Van
Dinh. President Diem, who had a-
good reputation, became Vietnam’s
honest leader. With a good presi-
dent and the people’s will to ﬁght,
a foundation for the war began.

Even with a foundation, “we

day betweennien and Women students on marriage and
morality. " ‘ -
The" discussion held in the
Towers was scheduled as the sec-
.ond in a lecture series sponsored
by Men’s Dorm Council. Dr. Vujan
was supposed to speak~on “Rela-
tionship Between Men-- and
Women.” The ‘program started
' with direct questions aimed at the
speaker, but soon the students
were soundingoﬂ.’ theirown views
and debating the topic among
themselves. : ~ A ‘ .
x The discussion moved from sex-
ual behavior on college campuses
to pre-martial to extra-marital re-
lations. Posed the ﬁrst query:
“What are your views on a
person's interests outside his
wife?”
Vujan: “Before marriage one has
the right to change his mind but
then after that the involvement
should be with one‘ person only.
In any case one has to be com-
pletely honest with one’s partner
and she’”has a perfect right to b
hurt by your actions.” _ " '1
'‘‘But isn’t it possible" to ‘be in
love with one person and have
another woman who is desirable
sexually?” ' in '

 

alone” Tran Van Dinh emphasized.

DR. ALEXANDER VUJAN leads an informal discussion on sex and

 

“I don’t say it is wrong, but the
situation is very unusual. Rela-
tioiiships begin to-fall apart when
mu -ual trust fails.” .
i I coed: “But why should such
tliikiigs even go on?”
“Because grass is alw_ays greener
onfthe other side.” .
§Another student: “If the man
always returns to his Wife It
shows he loves her. Man is an
egotist and likes to make con-
quests.” I _ ' .
Doctor: “That sounds like a child
returning to his mother and his
wife is not his mother.” '

“How about wild parties

most successful social events

of the year, Eddie’s Speakeasy, last‘ Friday.

A joint project of Stud
Union Board, the affair was a
combination party-dance featur-

‘Debbie Hoffman and her rendition
of “Ballin’ the Jack.” Miss Hoff-

humor in her performance in a
successful attempt to make up for
the shortcomings of her voice.
The entertainment reached its
climax with the appearance of the
,Eddie’s Speakeasy chorus line,
The Sexy Seven. Except for the
‘fact that they were clothed, The
Seven, led by Tom “Bombs”

.Abe1e, were highly reminiscent of

the Casino Burlesque’s recent Beef

Abe1e’s cohorts, who amply ﬁll-
_ed out the chorus _line, were Steve
Lowe, Steve Roberts, Phil Phillips,
Roger Johnson, Gary Smith, and

Terry Betras. In keeping with the

1920's theme of the entire pro-

gram, The Seven performed their
-version of the Charleston. They

bow as their ragtime accompanist,
Larry Bernfeld “marred” his
