that second semester ‘rushing has
‘both its ‘'‘advantages" and disadvant-

_.Pl'-IAOVPOVSED M[L|TARY BALL
Mr. Editor; _ -_ »V  _ 

IY'sh_oulVd" like-. to register, what I
think is‘ a-"needed protest to the pro-
posed mﬂitarzvgball of-.the‘:R. o-. '1‘. c.
.. ‘At the ‘outset let me say“that‘I am
opposed. to the'= presence of the" R. O.
 C. in.’ any university. _. The ..spirit
of an organization ‘tlV1at‘requir_.es dis-
cipline,‘ fosters regimentation, and
‘breeds an uncritical and .:prejudic_ia!V
.p'oint_of’ view; as‘ any military ‘system
must needs, do,‘ is directly contrary,
to the freedom and ﬂexibility of
"thought "so nVeVcessary in‘ attaining La
liberal education. . , _ .

Now as to the "military ball itself.
~The‘re have, in the past“ few years/.
been certain features introduced in-
to the R. 0.‘ T.‘ -C. of the country,
which > have very successfully" and
somewhat. insidiously hidden the real
issues involved and ‘which serve as
bait to catch immature and impress-
ionableﬂminds. And noneviof these
added attractions have anything to
doiwith the actual purpose of the
R. '0; T. 0., namely the" training or
young men in that legalized form of
murder as war. ".For instance, the
R. O.‘ T. ‘C. offers a $800 bribe to tliird
and fourth-year men, an - extremely"
"important factor withinany of them:-
also the R.‘ O. '1‘. C. affors, as the
lesser of * two, eyils, V. refuge ‘ from a
harmless but ~disagreeab1e‘and useless
‘c'ourse,V called ‘physical education; the
R. O. T. C. is advertised as teaching
‘-‘leadership, -citizenship, mathemaltics
(one member told me that he learned
far more math -in it than iVn,Vcollege)
etc; the R. -0. T. C. "attracts a large
group of simpleyouths who are too
old for the Boy Scouts but who still
_-like to be seen in soldier-boy uniform;
lastly, the-R. o. T. C. bidsfor-the
support of other groups and organi-
zations by appointing campus celeb-
rities as “cadet cfﬁcers", by parading
at foo_tb'a11'games, etc. 

And now the R. 0.’ T. C. is going
to hold -a military ball and thereby
entice another ele1nent..of population.
Furthermo/re“ it is going {to win ~over.r
the girls by selecting honorary _col-
onels, majors and captains. This all

Will wonders never cease?

When the world learned that a sor-
rel-topped college boy had signed a
$25,000 contract‘ to play in'a few foot-
ball games, it gasped. When it dis-
covered that fair co-eds of California

ad donned black derbies for drinks,
1 -shuddered; but the worst is yet to
come. Eor now the astounding fact
has been unearthed that agroup of
broad-minded freshmen together with
-a sophomore, proclaiming "themselves
asthe Pitt Gospel Team, have been
engaged in the monumental and origi
'nal— task of bettering the world. '

Last Sunday, the Gospel '1-Team jour-
neyed ove’r"the« Rocky Road to Par-

. nassus to deliver ‘their Epistle to the

Parnassians. V After saving some
thirteen and two-thirds merry souls,.
they all but lost their own when they
rode out of town on six-foot rails.’

Will college boys never learn ‘that
the task of enlightening this dull and
sordid orbit known as Earth is vain
and futile? V’
