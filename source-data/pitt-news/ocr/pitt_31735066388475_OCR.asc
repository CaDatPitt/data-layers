The University of Pittsburgh
has named the last two ﬁnalists
for the Pitt presidency.

John Dennis O’Connor, provost
and vice chancellor for academic
affairs at the University of North
Carolina-Chapel _Hill, and
Raymond Orbach, provost of the
College of Letters and Sciences at
the University of California—Los
Angeles are among five
candidates to replace outgoing
President Wesley Posvar.

Orbach, 56, will visit Pitt April
15 and 16 to meet and interview
with university leaders.

UCLA undergraduate student-
body president Dean Poulakidas
criticized Orbach for putting re-
search before undergraduate

education.

“Orbach has done great things
for UCLA in terms of research,
and given us a national reputation
on a basis of research, but he is
the provost of the College of
Letters and Sciences, and the fact
that he is known for what he has
done on this campus in terms of
research and recruiting research
faculty I think is. proof in itself of
the harm he has done to
undergraduate education at
UCLA," Poulakidas said.

The quality of the College of
Letter and Sciences has declined
during Orbach’s tenure,

. according to Poulakidas.

The college is “stagnant and
suffering because of Raymond
Orbach’s desire to give resources
— any resources that he can
attain — to research purposes

faculty," Poulakidas said.

“I think that students at UCLA,
particularly undergraduate
students, have a hard time trusting
Ray Orbach and have a hard time
believing that he is sincere,”
Poulakidas said.

However,he said that Orbach
is willing to talk to students.

“On a positive note, Ray Orbach
is approachable,” Poulakidas said.

Orbach earned his bachelor's
at the California Institute of
Technology and his doctorate at

. University of California- Berkeley.

After serving as an assistant
professor of applied physics at
Harvard University from 1961 to
1963, Orbach became a professor
of physics at UCLA.

Orbach was the assistant vice
chancellor for academic change

and curriculum development
from 1970 to 1972. He took on his
current position in 1982.

Neither O’Connor nor Orbach
could be reached for comment.

O’Connor, 49, will visit Pitt
today and tomorrow.

O’Connor has made great con-
tributions to UNC, said Matt Heyd,
UNC student body president.

“O’Connor is extremely
inﬂuential within our university.
He is very concerned about the
university’s status as a research
institution . . and has done a
really good job," Heyd said.

“Outside of the chancellor, he is.

probably the‘ most inﬂuential
person down here. That says a lot
about him, since the position has
not always been that way.”
Heyd said O’Connor has rec-
ently been working very hard to

deal with the budget cuts UNC is
expecting from the state this year.

“O’Connor is hard-working. He
has an extremely forceful and im-
pressive personality," Heyd said.

O’Connor earned his bachelor's

degree from Loyola University.
He went on to receive his master’s
degree from DePaul University
and his doctorate from North-
western University.
' O’Connor worked as a professor
of biology at UCLA from 1968 to
1979. From 1979 to 1981 he served
as the chair of the department of
biology, and in 1981 he became
the dean of life sciences.

He left UCLA to become the
vice chancellor of research and
graduate studies at UNC in 1987,
a post he held until 1988, when
he became the vice chancellor for
academic affairs.

Fast helps spread peace message

By Eric Hoch
Staff Writer

After one week of fasting outside of Carnegie
Mellon’s Wean Hall, the three people protesting
CM military research believe that they have reached
many students with their message of peace.

“People have been talking to us about the
research going on here at campus, and a lot of them
didn’t realize that 69 percent of the research done
. here is funded by the U.S. government,” said
former Pitt student Erin Bush. “Many have become
supportive, but some of them have insisted to us
that they are doing basic research."

“Even if they are doing basic research," said
activist Vince Eirene, “I’d still like to see the money

coming from the defense department going into
[World Health Organization], AIDS research or the

_ environment. ”

Eirene said the time he, Bush and Mike Glabiki
of the band Rusted Root have spent holding a vigil
and fasting has helped them “develop new hungers,
be able to think in what direction our lives and
country is going.” The group plans to continue
fasting for one month.

According to Eirene, “Gandhi once said, ‘Whatever
you do, make itlook useless to other people.’ He
spun wool and got his salt from the sea when most
of his fellow Indians wanted to violently revolt
against the British control. But it was his actions that
brought about changes in India, and that is what we
hope to do through our ‘useless acts.”’

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, April 9, 1991

By Mark Smith
stag Writer

A recent letter to Know Your
Rights asked how the First Amen-
dment protected free—speech
rights of high-school students.

Laws affecting students in high
schools are not only complex
but also are constantly changing.

Sinoejan. 13, 1988, high- school
students’ First Amendment rights
have been compromised by the
Hazelwood School District v.
Kuhlmeier Supreme Court
decision. In this case, the Supreme
Court upheld the power of school
administrators to control the
content of schoo1—funded
newspapers. The aftermath of

’ this decision has chilled free

speech on high—school campuses.

For example, at Park Hill High“

School in Kansas City, Mo., school
administrators have instituted a
prior-review policy covering all
stories about school

“administrators. The award-

winning Missouri newspaper,
Trojan, is challenging this policy

with the help of parents.

' In New Jersey, the Holmdel
Township High School principal
deleted an article criticizing the
school's sex—education program.
The article also described how to
use a condom effectively.

A 1989' national survey
conducted by Jim Patten, a
journalism professor at the
University of Arizona, found that
80 percent of high-school paper
advisers “described their
administrators as supportive of
student press rights.” Patten also
found that “nearly 23 percent of
the teachers said their students
are less likely to report on
controversial matters than before
the [Hazelwood] decision.
Similarly, more than 17 percent
said their students are less likely
to write editorials critical of school
politics. At 12' percent of the
schools, teachers reported that
school officials had established
prior-review policies where none
had existed before Hazelwood.”

The Hazelwood decision has
allowed certain restrictions on

students’ free-press rights;
however, the situations can vary
from state to state. If you feel
your rights are being violated,
you may need the assistance of a
lawyer. Sometimes advice can
also be obtained from community
organizations such as Neigh-
borhood Legal Services
Association, the Legal Aid Society
or the American Civil Liberties
Union.

Free speech limited for high—school students

Question: Whataboutfreedom
of expression in general?

Answer: Students’ First
Amendment rights are protected
in Pennsylvania. High—school
administrators, teachers or staff
may not interfere with a student’s
freedom of expression beyond
certain guidelines. For instance,
i.f you distribute hardcore
pornography, are libelous, incite
other students to riotor create an
uncontrollable disruption for
school officials, your actions are
not protected by the First
Amendment" It is important to
note that guidelines for an “uncon-
trollable disruption” give a certain
leeway to school administrators.

Q: Can student groups meet
on high-school property

during norvclass time even for '

. religious purposes?

A: Yes. Under the Equal Access
Act, even religious student groups
are permitted to meet on school
property if other student groups
are permitted. /

Pitt's coal research promotes use of alternative fuel

By Margaret Swisher
Stajf Writer

(This is the third segment of a
ﬁve-part series on the Pitt Trust.)

Pittsburgh's taxis and
limousines may soon be running
on natural gas instead of gasoline.

The Bituminous Coal Research
National Laboratory, one of the
ﬁve entities in the University of
Pittsburgh Trust, is doing research
to promote and develop the use
of this alternative fuel.

“While BCRNL continues to
work in the energy-research area,
one of the newer areas we are
gettinginto is natural gas,” said
John DeMarchis, executive vice

president of BCRNL. “BCRNL is g

working closely with a major gas
utility in the development of
alternative fuel use by the mini-
vehicle group.”

BCRNL has been in existence
since 1933. It wasn’t until 1983
that the coal industry decided to
divest from the research facility.
Pitt decided to continue those re-
search activities as BCRNL and in
1988 took control of the company
as a member of the trust.

Now BCRNL is located at the

‘- University of Pittsburgh Applied

Research Corporation.

According to DeMarchis, the
president of the company is
Joseph Yerushalmi, Ph.D., a
faculty member in Pitt’s chemical
engineering department.

DeMarchis said the company
has been with the original coal-

9 industry facility since 1961.

 

 
  

    

PITT
. l’R()(iPt\\l
(‘()LT;\'(‘lL

    

  
 

Developing new coal-burning
technologies in the utility
industries is one of the many
areas in which BCRNL is active.
“We also provide support services
in preparing coal that’s used by
other companies on various
research projects," he said.

One of the very significant
things that BCR accomplished
was creating a research program
that allowed utility companies to
utilize coal available in Penn-
sylvania that was normally not
used by the utility companies be-
cause of the varying properties
of coal.

“This is important in the sense

_....-4 —

that Pennsylvania coal was used

rather than out—of—state coal,”
DeMarchis said. “We convinced
utilities that they could use this
coal to produce steam.” .

Like most of the trust’s entities,
BCRNL is also working on
environmental research. “Another
project that we have with‘ the
state is to study the lending of
various coals with the hope of
reducing the pollution that would
normally be derived from burning
these coals,” said DeMarchis.
“Lending additives to the coal
cuts down pollution that causes
things like acid rain.” They are
also attempting to utilize
equipment to burn waste coal

and convert it into usable energy.

_ _{i-

Currently, alternative fuel is
working well for buses and trucks,
but BCRNL decided to concentrate
on an area that wasn't given
much focus: the rnini-vehicle.

“Mini-ﬂeets such as taxi-cab
companies and shuttle vehicles
aren’t financially able to establish
their own alternative-fuel
network. We can lend some help,”
DeMarchis said. “We felt by
working in this area with them,
holding seminars and providing
them with technology transfers
and information, we can be very
helpful to those groups.”

In the future, BCRNL hopes to
put together a technology center
that would be devoted to various

activities with alternative fuels. ’

“Such a center could provide a
source of information to groups
interested in providing alternative

, fuels,” DeMarchis said “We would

also provide training centers_ to

train mechanics to work on-
vehicles that are using alternative

fuels to make sure they are up on
the latest technologies, since this
an ever—changing field." _
The advantages of naturalgas
are numerous. _ . ‘ ’
“Natural gas is about half the
price of gasoline. It is very clean-
burning, and as compared with
gasoline and diesel fuels, irdoes
not have any harmful pollutants
associated with it,” he said.

Don ’t deal with Kurds. ..

. Since Saddam Hussein’s forces have been defeated in
Kuwait, they have been engaged in a struggle over their
homeland. Uprisings after the war by Kurdish rebels have
put the state of the Iraqi government in turmoil. .

After the war in the Persian Gulf ended, the United
Statesbegan pulling its troops out of Iraq, pausing to
destroy Iraqi weaponry. Now, the country /has been

I I implored by the Kurds to enter into this conﬂict.

I ‘ -Secretary of State James Baker is currently in Turkey
observing the thousands of Kurdish refugees‘ who have

ﬂed Iraq since the beginning of the war. Many have

i pleaded with him in an attempt to get U.S. help in ousting
f Saddam. ~ A ‘

Saddam has ordered clieniical attacks against the Kurds

since the uprisings began. Napalm bombs and

phosphorous gas attacks have been common, killing

“ many innocent civilians in the process.

The U.S. has given some humanitarian aid to the rebels.

" Food and medicine have been airlifted through Iraqi air

space and dropped to the Kurds.’ Furthermore, Baker
stated that no restrictions will be made on these

‘humanitarian air lifts.

Unfortunately, the United States has been placed in its

i own bind. During the war, President Bush pleaded with
‘ the Iraqi people to rise up against Saddam. Now that they

_have, the United States has come under pressure to

-. withdraw from Iraq as soon as possible,.ignoring the

internal struggles. -

This, however, is exactly what the United States must
do: not get involved with the problems inside Iraq. If we
do get involved, we will become a target for other

it . countries who will claim that our role as “world policeman”

--has extended too far. By intervening in the conﬂict, the

United States would be violating a United Nations’
resolution which says that no country is permitted to
intervene in the internal affairs of another.

_" Therefore, we believe that even these. air lifts must

cease. Providing aid to one group in this conﬂict while

This is not a new charge against our country. In 1989,
President Bush was heavily criticized for interfering in the
internal affairs of Panama, ousting Manuel Noriega in

’ favor of someone more suited to American interests."

The United States has been criticized in the past for
being hypocritical in its foreign policy, intervening when
it feels it should while ignoring other situations.
Unfortunately, the only unhypocritical foreign policy is
an isolationist one.

' That idea, however, was put to rest long ago; namely,
during World War I, when the United-States, after
realizing its superpower status, discovered that foreign
policy, however contradictory or hypocritical, is
desperately needed. I

Remember the good old days
—— the days when the cost of
living was down, and the general
spirit of people that were pro-
American was up? Yeah, I
remember, too; back when I was
younger, and ‘I believed that
police were here to protect us,
and the government was
interested in helping the younger

generations to become more _
educated.

Well, those days no longer exist.
The Los Angeles Police

~- Department proved last month

that it was not out to help the
people but to harass and get its
kicks out of racial beatings. And
now, the government. "

What has it done this time, you
ask? '

Okay. I’ll tell you: it's taken
away the right to copy.

Well, it’s taken away the right
to copy copyrighted material, if

‘ that's not confusing enough. for

you.

Don’t you think it should be '

focusing its time on something

more relevant to the world? ‘

Something like the war on drugs,
or penalizing drunk drivers?
Noooo. The U.S. District Court
has taken away Kinko’s Copy
Center's right to copy.

Back to the more recent olden
days. Remember waiting in line

Remember the

good ol’ days?

Lisa Raff

for an hour or more at Kinko’s to
get a package of paper bound by
plastic that your professor had
listed as “required” reading? Those
days are gone.‘ Kiss them
goodbye. Well  maybe.
‘According to the U.S. District
Court, Kinko’s was infringing on
copyright laws. Now, Kinko’s
must utilize copyright—perrnission
systems and publisher agreements
before copying material for

students. .
It’s a possibility that after all the _

red tape is clear, Kinko’s packets
will return by next spring. For
next semester, however,
obtaining copies of copyrighted
material from Kinko’s will be
nearly impossible. -

Some of you may be advocates
of the ruling for a fewreasons.
No. 1, Kinko's packets cost
money, and this ruling may
eliminate the need to spend that
cash. No. 2, you just may not
have to read as much for your
classes.

But those of you who believe
that are pretty damn selfish.

The goal of schooling is to

learn, right? Correct me if I’m V

wrong. How are we supposed to

learn when we can’t get our hands
on the materials we need? Kinko’s
was a convenience. The libraries
on the Pitt campus do not have
every publication ever printed,
but Kinko’s had the methods to
get them for us.

Little by little, inch by inch, the
educational system in the United
States is going downhill- The
government that is supposed to
help us is killing us’, taking away
our right to learn and forcing us
to lose faith in our court systems.

I've often been accused of
exaggerating, and sometimes, this
is true. Now, however, it isn’t.

Sadly enough, there's nothing
we can do about this situation
but deal with it. '

Recently, various groups have
tried to tell us what we can and
can’t do about pregnancy and
what music we can and can’t
listen to. Now, the court system is
pulling the same stunts. It’s a
damn shame and only leaves the
imagination to wonder, “What's
left? What are they going to try to
take away next? Are they going to
tell me that I can’t go to thelibrary
andcopy a page from a book or
magazine?”

Who knows? As always on this
campus, anything’s possible.

Gree/es moved on own accord

I am writing in response to
David Matta’s article regarding
:Greek; Week problems, which
appeared in The Pitt News on

Tuesday, April 2. I am currently the business
manager of this organization and would like to
clarify some of the allegations made by Mr. Matta.
Regarding the use of Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall, I would first like to say that its capacity
exceeds the Carnegie by 200 seats. Next, I would
like to divulge that the cost of leasing Soldiers and
-Sailors was a mere 40 percent of the lease cost of the
Carnegie. This enabled the rental of more rehearsal '
time, which in turn led to a more professional show
overall. Also, Soldiers and Sailors is in greater
proximity to campus, facilitating the organization of
the event for the Greek Week personnel responsible.

Letters

Finally, no damage was sustained by Soldiers and

Sailors this year as a result of the Greek Week

events..
As [for] the use of

Metropol for the Dance Marathon, * ‘

its capacity is also greater than its

predecessor, the Syria Mosque. For a facility with
a greater capacity, as well as greater public appeal,
the lease costs of Metropol were equal to those of
the Syria Mosque. Also, a 12—hour dance marathon
is far easier on the students, and much cheaper
administratively, which leads to a greater profit
margin, and not “less money,” as Mr. Matta asserted.

Most importantly, the reason Greek Week was
unable to lease the Syria Mosque had nothing to do
with the condition in which it was left in the
previous year. Instead, it was unavailable because

of a private reservation that was made by the

building's owners. l...l

During the late 1970s, the New
York Yankees were known as
“the best team money could buy.”‘
Now, despite their legendary farm
system, the Los Angeles
Dodgers could claim that title
themselves after a busy winter on
the free—agent market.

The Dodgers spent $36 million
in their quest to dethrone the
World Champion Reds, and it was
deﬁnitely money well spent.

In Darryl Strawberry, they have
the pure power hitter that they
have lacked since their days in
Brooklyn. Brett Butler, the
premiere lead-off hitter in the
National League, fills the void that
Steve Sax made in 1988. Add these
two men to a team that has four
potential .300 hitters, and the
Dodgers look to be giving ﬁts to
opposing pitchers.

Eddie Murray, coming off a great
season (.330, 28 homers, 98 RBI),
followed by Strawberry (.277, 37
homers, 108 RBI) and Kal Daniels
(.296, 27 homers, 94 RBI) sets up
the NL’s most fearsome 3-4-5
combination.

Jose Canseco in the All-Star
Game last year knows that he can
bring it. But can he repeat his

1990 season of 20 wins and 2.92 '

ERA’ ,

Where this impressive pitching
stops is in the bullpen. Jay Howell
was the only successful closer last
year, recording 16 saves. Last year,_
he had virtually no help from ex-
Pirate Jim Gott, who made people

Men’ste"m'Swins tbres» drops

think he was good with his ﬂuke
35 saves in 1988. Lefty Dave
Walsh, who shined in the minors
last year with 22 saves, should
share the closer duties with
Howell.

What the Dodgers gain in
offensive production, they lose in
defense. Useless Alfredo Griffin
and the overrated Juan Samuel
boot more balls than Gary
Anderson-, and the Strawman‘ and
Daniels will never win Gold
Gloves. But as long as the hitting
and pitching improves, it won’t
matter.

A team has not repeated as

World Series champs since the

New York Yankees did 13 years
ago. Ironically, a member of that
Yankee team was Cincinnati
Reds manager Lou Pinella, so he
should know how hard it will be
for his Reds to do it.

Cincy’s greatest strength is its
bullpen. Randy Myers, Rob Dibble
and Norm Charlton formed what
Reds fans affectionately called
“The Nasty Boys.” Charlton, who
will probably move into the
starting rotation, was the
southpaw set-up man for Myers
and Dibble, who combined» for 42
saves and a 1.91 ERA. ’

Dibble smoked 12.49 strikeouts
per nine innings on the year and
should again share the closer
duties with Myers.

Myers was second in the league
with 31 saves and is the hardest
throwing lefty in baseball.

Opposing teams can forget about
late-inning rallies against these
guys.

Lefty Tom Browning and World
Series MVP Jose Rijo are solic
performers, so the first two spots
are set. Problems begin to arise ir
the 3-5 spots.

Jack Armstrong earned a'starI
in last year's All-Star Game witl‘.
his 11-3 record but collected only
one more win with a 6.56 ERA fo
the rest of the season. Charltor
went 6-3 in 14 starts lastyear ant
posted an impressive 1.93 ERA,
but he and a young Scott SC1.ldCl€l
are untested.

Move over Ozzie Smith,
because the Barry Larkin era has
arrived. He led all NL shortstop:
in assists and doubleplays 
batting .301 and knocking in 67
runs.

Chris Sabo led all NL thirc
basemen in fielding percentage
and combines power (25 HRS)
with speed (25 stolen bases). Hie

scrappy style of play keeps the A

team’s intensity up.

The offensive keys will be Eric
Davis and Paul O’Neill. A healthy
Davis is capable of putting up
Canseco—like numbers, and
O'Neill has the strength to leaci
the league in homers.

Dodgers look to unseat champion'Reds in West

If it weren't for their weak
pitching staff, thesan Francisco .
Giants could come out on top.
But any team that signs Bud Black,
a lifetime 83~82 pitcher, to a four-
year, $10 million contract deserves
to lose in my opinion.

The Giants’ pitching staff is full
of old, injury-prone right-handers.
Old man Rick Reushel, Mike
LaCoss and Kelly Downs all had
knee surgery, and reliever Don
Robinson is coming off hip
surgery.

Black is the biggest waste of
money since the stealth bomber,
and if not for the pitching genius
of manager Roger Craig, this
starting rotation will be lucky to
produce one 17—game winner.

Long time Yankee reliever Dave
Righetti will give Craig a strong
closer if Craig can find him a
reliable set~up man.

The one thing that can make
this team a viable contender is its
outstanding hitting. Kevin Mitchell
(35 HR, 93 RBI) has proved that
his incredible 1989 season was
no ﬂuke. _Will Clark, who vowed
to improve from last season's 19
HR, 95 RBI season, looks to have
a monster year. ‘

Last year, third baseman Matt
Williams was the team’s biggest
surprise, leading the league in
RBIs (122). He’s only 25 and is
reminiscent of a young Mike
Schmidt.

San Fran replaces the lead-off
void of Brett Butler's departure

with NL batting champ Willie
McGee, who still has the legs to
steal 40 bases.‘

The Giants have an excellent
nucleus of strong talent, except in
their starting pitching, and that
will keep them in the hunt.

The rest of the teams in the NL
West are at least a year or two
from serious contention. Thesan
Diego Padres had been picked
to make a run at the title for the
last two years and have always
disappointed. This year the
expectations are much lower, and
rightly so.

Gone are the big bats and bad
attitudes of Joe Carter and Jack
Clark. The Padreswill rely on first
baseman Fred McGriff and catcher
Benito Santiago for power this
year.

The acquisition of veteran
shortstop Tony Fernandez, a
lifetime .290 hitter, should take
some pressure off three—time
batting champion Tony Gwynn,
who suffered through a rocky
season both on and off the field.

The San Diego starting rotation
is only adequate. Bruce Hurst,
once a World Series star of the
Boston Red Sox, still pitches a lot
of quality innings, but he has been
a disappointment (26-20 since
joining the team). Mr. Reliable,
Ed Whitson, led the staff in ERA
(2.60) and wins (14) and although
he has excellent control, doesn't
have the power to carry the staff.

After these two pitchers, there
is little depth. The wild Andy

Derek Lilliquist will probably
round out the rotation. Combined,
they were a dismal 26-37 last

Before the start of last season,
the Atlanta Braves looked to
have one of the best young
pitching staffs since the Mets of
the mid-’80s.

That staff went out there and
put up some incredible numbers
(4.56 ERA, worst in the league).-
Not exactly what manager Bobby
Cox had in mind.

Well, the staff is still young

of potential. John Smoltz (14-11,
3.56 ERA) is the ace of the staff but
will need help from Pete Smith,
Tom Glavine and 21-year-old
Steve Avery, who combined for
an 18-29 record and a fat 4.73
ERA. Thirty-ﬁve—year-old veteran
Charlie Leibrandt’s job will be to
help mold this staff into consistent
winners.

Rookie of the Year Dave Justice
and 30-30 man Ron Gant give the
Braves solid outﬁeld on which to
build a future. .

They combined for 60 homers
and 162 RBI last year, and both
want to prove that their
performances were not ﬂukes.

Speaking of ﬂukes, Deion
Sanders will try to crack the “Prime
Time” on Ted Turner’s super-
station. If his bat is as big as his
ego, he could be a star.

If you are sick of the whining of
overpaid players, the Houston

9 Astros are your team. General

Manager Bill Wood unloaded 11
Astro regulars who demanded big

‘ money in favor of the youth

movement. »

The bad news for Houston fans
is that they are now at least four
years away from serious
contention. Former Cy Young
Award winner Mike Scott will
need to regain some of his former

_ greatness if the Astros want to

stay out of the cellar. The loss of
Danny Darwin, who had the

‘ lowest ERA in the.NL, and stopper

Dave Smith will hurt an already
marginal pitching staff.
Manager Art Howe has
promised to keep catcher Craig
Biggio behind the plate, and
Biggio is an early All-Star favorite.
The Astros are also hoping that
slugging “phenom’_’ Eric Anthony,
once billed as savior, learned

. something from his seven weeks

in the minors and his dismal .192
batting average. With the loss of

_ Glenn Davis to the Orioles, the

Astros will count on Anthony for
run production.
