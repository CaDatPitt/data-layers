The sun didn’t shine brightly in '

the green pasture of Van Cortlandt v
Park, New York, Monday after-

noon for the local Panther har-

  
 

   

riers when they placed sixteenth '
in the national IC4-A meet which »
was won by Leslie MacMitchell of
N». Y. U. ’

Coach 0lson’s pride and joy,
William Curtis, was the top man

_ to come in for the Blue and Gold

in 44th place while Allias trotted
in 72nd, and Captain John Brosky
ﬁnished in 86th place. Other “local
men to cross the ﬁnish line were

Graham, 101; Miller, 102; and

 Davis 108.

, In copping his third consecutive
IC4-A title, lVIacMitchell matched

the feat performed by John Paul

ones of Cornell backlin the early
nineties. MacMitchell was clocked

0‘ at 26:40.1 when he broke the. tape.

In second position was Robert
Nichols wearing the Rhode Island
State colors and GlennlV. ‘Vlasten

lion passing threat

Phi Eps Blast P1'Ka’s Unbeaten Mark; .

Scoring. on two quick thrusts in
the first half, Phi Epsilon Pi re-
mained in the running for the ‘fra-
ternity league championship, by
defeating, PiKA, 13-0, last Mon-
day. The win makes another con-
test between these two teams
"necessary, with the winner gaining
the I-F‘ crown.-

Thell-‘-lhi Eps took the opening
kickofﬂ and -0 on three lightning

gplays scored the first touchdown,

as “Figgy”!-Dutchpran the ball over
from the two. Jay Silverberg took
Dutch’s pass to add the conversion.
ln the closing moments of the
half, Hal Weiuman scored on an-
other pass from Dutch. The “Eon-
version failed, and the Phi Eps had
a 13’ point advantage, which they
held “for the, ‘remainder of the
game.’ - -

.PiKA rooters had very little to
cheer ‘about, as their favorites
threatened only once throughout
the game. The threat was ended

as the Phi Eps held for downs, with
Jay Silverberg, captain of the
Neville streeters, breaking ‘up an
end zone pass, as he crashed into
the fence at the end of the ﬁeld. ’

Earlier in the day, the Oilers
eked out a decision over the Dive
Bombers, 13-12, and thus gained
a chance to meet APD in the semi-
ﬁnal game of the independent
loop. .

The Oilers held a 13-0 advantage

as the "half ended, but the gallant

‘Dive Bombers fought back, and
only the fact that they missed both
their tries for the extra point, pre-

vented them from winning or ge.t-

ting at least a tie.

Kelly and Trimble scored the
touchdowns,,whi1e Grance scored
the deciding point for the Oilers.

““""" '" |C4"AM“*   Grid Batte ‘With Penn, State

Not since the year 1919 has a Penn State team entered
the city of Pittsburgh -and gone home victor over Pitt; not:
since that da.rk November afternoon in 1939 has the Nittany,
Lion beaten a Panther aggregation; and, probably the inost“
important from the customer standpoint, not since the advent
of the series has the eventual winner been so much in doubt.

It will be a typical “give and take” battle between these
two traditional rivals next Saturday afternoon at the Pitt

stadium. Although neither team
has any bowl possibilities or any
Eastern championship at stake, a
crowd of 35,000 people is expected
to witness the contest.

Pitt has been coming back fast
after their ﬁrst ﬁve defeats, and

are, ‘at the present time, the most ’

talked about football combination
in the country. They showed the
ﬁghting spirit that Pitt teams are
made of lastsaturday when they
rallied in the last ﬁve minutes to
take" a seemingly lost ball game
out of the fire. P

The Penn State "team played an
erratic West Virginia crew coach-
ed by Wee Willie Kern last Sat-
urday and scored an early first
‘period touchdown, then coasted in
with an easy win. Obviously they
were taking it a little easy for'the
on-coming game with Pitt.

Edgar “Special Delivery” Jones
will be the man that the Higgins-
men will watch next Saturday, but
it seems as though it will not do
much good. Fordham ,scouts. told
their gridders all about Jones, but
still he ran wild. Nebraska scouts
told their boys all about him, and
once again they could not stop him.
So it may not do much good wheth-
er the scouts bother telling their
players about Jones.

Probably the outstanding men on
‘the Penn State squad are Captain
Lenny Krouse, John “Pepper” Pet-
rella, and‘Bill Smaltz.

Smaltz has made a habit of an-
