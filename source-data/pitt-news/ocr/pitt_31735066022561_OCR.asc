 SGB president, 1992 board inducted

By David T. Welch

Asst. News Editor

At his inauguration in the
William Pitt Union last night
Student Government President-
elect Gil Golden said heis

yg confident that he and the new

9 board will make a signiﬁcant
contribution to studentlife at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Golden, who was sworn in by
his predecessor Brent Saunders,
also took a look back at the past
board and its accomplishments.

“The 1991 SGB, amidst much

,~g___ criticism, has nonetheless
I succeeded in some very
formidable projects, mostnotably
increasing campus safety and
promoting a better academic

Pittsburgh,” Golden said.
The new SGB takes office Jan.
6. P

Golden said he hopes “to be
able to continue the role of
president of SGB with the same
enthusiasm, dedication, and good
judgment as Brent. -

“My goal is to see to it that I’m
there for the board members to
help them initiate new projects
and work on them,” Golden said.

Golden said the most important
issue facing this student
government is campus safety. “If
you are here for an education
and it is not safe, then you have
a conﬂict of interest,” Golden
said. '

“Safety is a top priority. Crime
Stop has to be revamped. A lot of
students don't know what it’s

supposed to accomplish,” SGB
member—elect Bryan Bender said.

A well-organized shuttle system
is one way to make the campus
more safe, according to board
member Jacob Brody.

Board member-elect Daniel
Leichter said the SGB is trying to
organize an escort service, so
students do not have to walk
across campus alone. ‘‘It will go
from the depths of South Oakland
all the way to North Oakland,"
Leichter said.

Pitt President J. "Dennis
O’Connor said he does not know
the new board members very
well.

“I may have met them with all
of them, but not in an organized
fashion  It looks they will be a

Children’s
hot line

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

' The hot line at Children’s
Hospital that has been answering
questions about an HIV-positive
staff member received 5,000 calls
last week from parents concerned
that their children may have been
exposed to the AIDS virus.

Last week Children’s revealed
that a member of the operating
room staff had tested positive for
HIV. A

The employee is seriously ill
and is no longer dealing with
patients, according to Lynn
McMahon of Children’s public
relations.

McMahon would not say if the
staff member had AIDS. She also
would not specify in which area
of the hospital the employee
worked.

Between June 1990 and
November 1991, the staff member
had been present during 1,000

I recently heard a story about a
student who wrote a letter to her
mother before the holiday break
that went something like this:

“I'm sorry I haven’t written for
a while, but my stationery was
burned in the dormitory fire. I
was only in the hospital for a few
weeks, and the doctor said that
the scars should heal in time. The
fire did have its advantages.

Since I needed a place to stay,
I moved in with Zeke, a new guy
that l’ve been seeing. He’s a little
unconventional but really a good
guy. Unlike many of the people
in our cult, he really wants to do
something about his drug
problem.

lt’s also cheaper this way. He
can't find a job that “totally
expresses who he is,” so now I
(or I should say you and Dad)
only have to pay for one place.

down, Mom. None of this is true.
What I really wanted to tell you is
that I think I'm getting a “D” in
chemistry, and I thought this story
might help put my grade in
perspective.”

I'm not sure if this strategy
worked, but the story reminded

Coping on campus

Parents and students share anxiety about returning home

me of how anxious a lot of
students get about going home
for the Christmas break.

They often say that they don’t
know how to communicate with
their parents any more and find
them overly intrusive, critical,
nosy and generally impossible to
be around.

Humanizing the relationship
between parents and their adult
children is not easy. Some parents
have their own problems that
limit progress in this area. Others,
though they may mean well, have
a hard time realizing that their 20-
year-old son or daughter cannot
think or behave in ways that are
compatible with their 40-to—60-
year-old parents.

But usually both parents and
students contribute to the
difficulty.

Often both are trapped in acting
out earlier scripts. Students need
to ask, “Am I responding to my

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, December 3, 1991 

parents as I do to other adults, or
am I regressing and responding
to them as I did when I was much
younger?"

Parents may be stuck in their
need to treat college-age students
as if they were still younger
children.

But students can short-circuit
this attitude by responding with
reason . rather than with
leftover responses from
childhood, such as anger, hurt or
avoidance.

If efforts to change our family
relationships are accompanied by
good will, trust, toleration of
differences and willingness to
forgive, both parties can learn
and grow.

Small bits of progress are
probably the best that can be
expected over the holiday break,
but most of the good things that
happen to us in life come through
these kind of gradual changes. .

THIS prrr NEWS, Tuesday, December 3, 1991

 

By Richard Overmoyer
Staﬁ" Writer

Dr. Herbert Needleman of Pitt’s
medical center has devoted his
life to wiping out childhood lead
poisoning, which has been
described as one of the worst
environmental disasters of our
time. ’

“All my life what I’ve been
trying to do is take the science
and put it to work, which is what
we all should be doing. It is one
thing to to publish papers, but if
you want to see things happen,
you’ve got to act,” Needleman
said.

Needleman is chair of the
national Alliance to End
Childhood Lead Poisoning, which
aims to raise awareness and
change perceptions about lead
poisoning and establish
prevention programs.

The rates of lead poisoning
increase as population increases
in urban areas.

“There is a fallacy that Pittsburgh
escaped this problem. T hat’s

T536 _ ' Bc3i~i7T"‘‘"|=éLI'7i3_EFiiiTir3_ " _ SE07

nonsense, but it’s a very ﬁxed
misperception. I've tried very hard

to get people to stop
believing it,” Needleman
said.

“A serious problem in this
country is that young people
aren’t getting educated. One of
the reasons for that is that the
brains that many children are
bringing to the classroom are
already tampered with,"
Needleman said.

Lead’s effects on children are
not reversible. “Lead is a
neurotoxin, a cellular poison of
incredible versatility. It affects all
organs of the body, but
most pertinent to children is that
it damages their brains,” he
said.

Needleman began his medical
career as a pediatrician and was
soon introduced
poisoning. “It quickly became
apparent to me that putting
medicine into the children was
not enough. When you treat a kid
and put him back into the same
environment, you can expect to

to lead»

see him again.

“The first case I treated was a
young Hispanic child. I told the
mother that she had to find a new
house; her house was dangerous.
She asked me where she was
supposed to live. I suddenly
realized that the houses available
to her were probably all the same.
That persuaded me that this was
bigger than just making a
diagnosis and prescribing
drugs.”

Needleman centered his
attention on the school» across
from his office in inner—city
Philadelphia. _

“The problem is lead exposure
occurs around [when children
are] 18 months to 3 years old,"
Needleman said.

He needed to find a way to
measure children’s lead-blood
levels when they were no longer
receiving as high of a dose of
lead. He collected baby teeth and
found they were exceptional
markers of lead levels.

“Kids who have lead poisoning
have very high levels of lead in

their teeth,” Needleman said. “I
now had the tool'I needed to
conduct my studies.”
Needleman went on to discover
that children with higher lead
levels in their teeth have lower
IQ scores. Since then he has
continued his research and has
found many other correlations.
“I published a paper last year
which showed that lead- poisoned
children have seven times the
failure rate of graduating from
high school and six times the rate
of reading disabilities,” he said.
The problem with ending lead

. poisoning is the cost involved.

The government estimates that it

costs $2,100 to remove lead from
a six-room house.

This figure multiplied by the.

estimated 57 million U.S. homes
that still contain lead—based paints
is about $120 billion.

Since most of these homes are
located in medium- to low-
income areas Needleman believes
it will have to be the government's
responsibility to take care of the
problem.

“It will eventually come from
the federal government’s pocket,
but the payoffs will be enormous
because we are paying for it now
on special education.”

us to be service oriented, not this
cowboy crap that sometimes goes
on. The best attitude a policeman
can have is [concern] for the
safety and welfare of the people

. around him,” Mahoney said.

Mahoney began his patrol
around 10 p.m. with a routine
pass through Pitt President J.
Dennis O’Connor’s home on
Devonshire Street. “T here’s the
Lincoln," Mahoney said, pointing
at the president's car.

The next stop was the projects
on Robinson Street in the Hill
District. Several youths eyed the
patrol car suspiciously as it passed
through the dimly lit streets.

“You see these guys standing
around. You know what they’re
doing, don’t you? They're selling
drugs,” Mahoney said with the
voice of 20 years“ police
experience. “This area up here is
dangerous. I call it the
demilitarized zone.”

The next stop was the parking
lot next to Veteran’s Hospital. A
man came up tothe car and

asked not to be ticketed for
parking without a permit. “I’m
taking pictures for these guys,"
he said, pointing to the fraternity
houses. “I don’t have a permit.”

Mahoney permitted him to stay
and moved on. Driving on,
Mahoney talked about working
the night shift.

“They call this the shit shift.
You catch the tail end of the
people coming home from work
at five [o’clockl, the students,
leaving class, and you catch when
the bars open and close,”
Mahoney said.

Mahoney then drove to Fifth
Avenue down Meyran Avenue to
Forbes Avenue. Turning on to
Bigelow Boulevard, Mahoney
drove past the remains of the
Syria Mosque. Pointing up the
street beyond the Chevron
Chemical Building, he said, “We
get calls up here, and we answer
them. Cars getstolen, and people
get mugged up here.”

I-lc was cut off by the dispatcher.

required a response.

Outside Lothrop Mahoney let
the officers who responded first
take the call, and he waited
outside as backup. ‘‘I’m not going
to take you up there because we
would just be interfering,”
Mahoney said.

He went on to explain the
importance of having a' female
officer as a respondent to such
calls.“ln the case of rape or where
the woman has been beat up
really bad, the woman mighthate
the sight of men and you’ll want
to have a female officer there,”
Mahoney Said.

The incident was an argument
between a male and a female. No
one was injured, and no arrests
were made.

Once order had been restored
the routine continued into South
Oakland where Mahoney pointed
to a rundown brown building on
Zulema Street.

“This used to be a crack house.
It was busted a couple years
ago,” he said.

Mahoney said he does not get
nervous when responding to calls.
“Very few times do I get nervous
responding to a call. I get nervous
afterwards because as you get
older you realize that you can get
hurt or die out there.”

At 11:23 p.m., the dispatcher
reported a street ﬁght on Dawson.
“The people usually disperse
lwhen police arrive], with the
exception of those lying in the
street,” Mahoney said.

On the way a crowd of students
carrying a keg of beer to an
apartmentstopped all motion and
conversation and followed the
patrol car with their eyes until it
was out of sight.

The fight on Dawson was
broken up by the time the police
arrived.

Leaving the scene Mahoney
continued to the comers of Forbes
and Bouquet Street. Pointing to
the crowd gathered at the corner
he said, “You have a potpourri of
all kinds of people from different
areas. You have people from the
Hill, Homestead, the North Side,
and then you have the Oakland
crowd. There are people
interacting that have never met
before,” Mahoney said.

At 12:06, there is a report of
bottles being thrown on Louisa
Street, but seconds after the‘
dispatcher reports a party at 315
McKee Place where people are
throwing things and urinating
from the balcony.

Police go in to break the party
up. An officer outside tells the

partygoers that they will be
arrested if they do not want to
leave.

“You get to the point where
you say ‘The hell with this. I'm
sick of this. Everyone is going to
leave,”’ Mahoney said.

There was no more news about
the bottles on Louisa Street.

Driving up Oakland Avenue
Mahoney spotted a white Volvo
reﬂecting the lights of Caleco’s
bar. It had spoilers, gold trim and
gold-spoked rims. “Now that's a
drug car,” Mahoney said.

It’s 12:19, and the next stop on
the beat is 7-Eleven. Mahoney
chatted with some of his law-
enforcement colleagues, and at
12:59, it’s time to hit the street.

Passing by Capri Pizza, the
scene of a recent drive-by
shooting, the patrons outside eyed
the car as it passes not moving
until it has made some distance
between them.

Driving along Mahoney began
to outline the problems with the
department of public safety.

“The amount of [police
protection on campus] is
inadequate  Brennan tried to

tell the universitythat he needs ‘

of surgical records showed that

no incidents, such as a glove
puncture, had occurred which
would cause a risk for the
transmission of the virus,
according to the Children’s
medical director. »

The hot line, 692-7500, has
received fewcalls this week,
McMahon said.

Most callers to the hot line
wanted to find out if their
children and the infectedjstaff
member were in the operating
room at the same time, McMahon
said.

“There’s a lot of rumors out

Mississippi

there,” she said.

There are no plans for
widespread AIDS testing of
children, but if a parent expresses
an interest, Children’s will arrange
free tests either through the
hospital or the county health
department, according to
McMahon.

Children’s would not let the
hot line operators answer
questions about the nature of the
calls from worried parents. “The
calls are conﬁdential,” she said.

Operators are prepared to
discuss “facts about the employee

. and HIV testing,” McMahon

' said.

Theft
Continued from page 1

there was no security guard at the door, several residents said.
The residents whose rooms were broken into believe the thief
entered through the stairwell.

“We pay far too much to live here not to be safe,” Darcangelo
said. “With all the money we pay it seems it wouldn’t cost too
much to have someone sit down here to make sure hundreds
of dollars of our stuff isn’t stolen.”

Four rooms were broken into and robbed, one room was
broken intoand nothing was taken, and the other room in the
wing wasn’t broken into.

The residents said they thought the thief might return.

“I want to be able to sleep and leave my room without
worrying,” said resident D] Williams.

They were also worried about more thefts over the end-of-
semester break. “Maybe we can leave [the thief] some milk and
cookies,” Darcangelo joked.

I went home for Thanksgiving this week-
end to New Jersey. OK, laugh all you want.
Go ahead.

Now that the laughing is over, let me tell
you a bit about the great state of NewJersey.

It is known as the “Garden State.” I recall
having heard some of my peers from
Pennsylvania saying, “Where are the gar-
dens?” (Snicker, snicker). It is called the
“Garden State” because at one time, before
the superhighways crisscrossed the state,
most of the produce for the tri-state area
(New York, Connecticut and New Jersey)
came from our farmlands.

Not all of our land was used for farming,
however. We have a great many cities in
New Jersey, and not all of them are on par
with Newark. People in New Jersey also
make fun of Newark, so that is acceptable.
We are the home of such places as Trenton,
Princeton and one of your favorite spots
(from the number of shirts that I see around
campus), Long Beach Island.

Our beaches and waters are cleaner than
ever before. We did have some scares in
1985, but that was six years ago. And yes,
we do have waves. The ocean around us is
much better than before.

We are home to many sports teams, such
as the Giants, the Devils and the Jets. We
host horse racing and even have the
Meadowlands Grand Prix, a Formula One
auto race. I

So you see, there are many things that are
great about New Jersey.

But this is not a praise article. It is a
guide to New Jersey. So let me guide

you .

— very large malls. People, young and old,
flock to these malls from miles around, mainly
to walk about and look at the other people.
Indigenous to these malls are what are known
as “mall chicks.”

These women are the kind that New Jersey
is famous for, with lots of makeup, the newest
fashions and big hair. What I mean by “big
hair”’is this: Get the front of your hair to stand
straight up. Use lots of hairspray. (It is a
wonder that these women smoke without
combusting.) Finish off the hairdo with a bow
or clip. That is big hair. The trick when dealing
with these women is to not touch their hair.
They get very angry when you do.

Our superhighways are dotted (every 10
miles or so) with tollbooths. These tollbooths
cost $35 to travel through, but you do not seem
to get anywhere, especially during the summer
months. For easier travel, you can purchase a
roll of tokens, but only Jerseyans know the
token system. Traffic is intolerable but inevi-
table, especially during rush hour and on
summer weekends. The trick for the super-
highways is that there is no trick. Just deal with
them and the traffic.

If you have to travel on a summer
weekend, do it either between '1 and 3 p.m. on

Throughout the state there are many malls

a Friday or very late at night (after
midnight).

New Jersey people, I must forewarn, are an
emotional people. We cried for joy when the
Giants won the Super Bowl, and we cheered
when Bruce Springsteen sang “Born to Run.”
Nevertheless, if you avoid certain topics,
New Jerseyites can be fun and exciting
people. “

Topics to avoid are the traffic, the fact that
the Giants and Mets are called New York teams
(although they play in the Meadowlands in
Secaucus, N.J.) and taxes.

We are the only constituents that I know of
who elected a new governor and within a year
had a demonstration on one of our super-
highways to impeach him.

Our taxes were raised a great deal and keep
on going up. Avoid this topic under any
circumstance.

One last thing: the accent. It is a huge
stereotype. J

Any New Jersey accent either comes from
the people who moved out of New York City
or Staten Island to the suburbs (like Newark,
Lodi and West New York) or the people from
Philadelphia who moved to places south of
Trenton.

To summarize, New Jersey is a great place,
full of excitement and adventure, and if you
watch out for your topics of conversation, we
can be a very enjoyable people. And remem-
ber that we make fun of people from Penn-
sylvania too.

As I sat on the 67C bus on my

“way into town, surrounded by

college students — I missed the
express by about a halfa minute -—
I mulled over whether I'd rather be
back in college instead of out
working in the “real” world like I
am. V

As I went back in my mind to
about six years ago, I realized
several things: What I learned in
my marketing courses has no re-
semblance to what is actually ap-
plied in a marketing department.
In fact after going home that day
thinking about this, I leafed through
some of my marketing textbooks. I
had stored them thinking I might
use them as reference material
someday. I quickly realized I should

do what I should have done years
ago —— trade them in for cash.

I remembered the one or two
really good courses I had and re-
alized the rest were a blur. I thought
about how getting up for an early
class seemed to be easier than
getting up for work and how a six-
hour school day is much more
desirable when compared to a 40-
hour work week.

I remembered, as I sat in a suit,
how much I enjoyed my walks to
and from school dressed comfort-
ably in a sweatshirt and jeans.

I observed the bowed heads
buried in textbooks, perhaps at-
tempting to memorize a few more
pages of knowledge before going
in for an -exam. I remembered
writing term papers — although I
don’t remember what they were
about— and although I had to pull
an occasional all-nighter, I’d choose
it over grappling with the unwanted
work piled on my desk.

I compared their bookbags filled
with notebooks, books and prob-
ably The Pitt News with my over-
sized purse stuffed with work shoes,
lunch and a magazine. I thought
about how their main concern was
making it through to the end of the
term and how mine was just making
it through to five o'clock.

Recalling the easy life of attending college

I thought about how it seemed
like I had more spending money
then than I do now, although I am
grateful to the government for
school loans (and especially the
low-interest rates.)

‘I thought about how in college
you don’t have to do anything
except show up for class and pass
some tests (and that’s not even
mandatory), compared to work
where you’re expected to show up
on time and where if you’re not
busy you have to at least look it so
you don’t get ﬁred..And how you
can't get laid off from school unless
they suspend you for failing, but
you can get laid off from work even
if you’re a good worker. And how
in college I looked forward to the
end of the term with .the same
anticipation I look forward to
payday.

As the bus neared Fifth Avenue
in Oakland and students headed
for the exit doors, I thought about
joining them. No putting up with
unwanted requests from co-work-
ers, no taking unwanted calls from
clients, no answering to an un-
wanted boss, just listening to a
professor lecture a couple of times
during the day. Yes, this would
definitely be preferable to listening
to the boss talk for even five min-
utes.

Before I knew it the bus was at
Grant Street. I headed for the exit
door, forgot about the students and
thought about trying to catch the
express from now on.

’Tis the season

How to have a politically correct holiday season

Happy time of the year when lots
of people go shopping to buy gifts
for others, when people adorn their
houses with lights, when you can
hear festive music wherever you
go, when people have lots of parties
and a time of overall good cheer.

I hope I have not offended
anyone’s sensibilities with that wish.
I am on a constant quest to be
politically correct.

The holiday season poses all

sorts of challenges for maintaining

my correctness. I have come up
with some ideas, and I would like
to share them with you so we can
all have alpolitically correct holiday
season. .

First, never, ever say “Merry
Christmas!” \

You can never be sure particular
people will be celebrating Christ-
mas. Even if you know their reli-
gious affiliation, they could be
exercising their right not to
celebrate. -

You must be sensitive to that and
not offend. them by wishing them a
“Merry Christmas!”

To be safest, just be rude and do
not say a thing.

Another important part of hav-
ing a PC holiday season is to know

Ed
Kichline

how to describe the important per-
sonalities of Christmas.

Santa Claus is not fat, over-
weight, portly or round. Santa is
merely thick. Santa’s elves are not
tiny, small or cute. The elves are
vertically challenged. They will ap-
preciate it if you talk about them
like that. '

Santa’s reindeer also have.some
concerns this season. Do what you
can to support the Free the Rein-
deer movement. The reindeer have
had enough of being tied to a
sleigh and being forced to haul a
wor1d’s worth of gifts on Christmas
Eve. Have a heart for the reindeer.
Tell Santa Claus to call Federal
Express.

When you are decorating your
tree, be aware of the ignorant
conventions you have created. You
probably put an angel at the top of
the tree, which is a common symbol
of good things in this world. How-
ever you should give fair place to
the evil in the world.

So when you decorate the top of
your tree, put an angel and a de-
mon.

When it comes to buying gifts to
put around your tree, you must
learn how to control yourself. In
this time of recession, conspicuous
consumption is out of style.

The PC thing to do is to buy only
one gift for each person on your
list. Anything more would be irre-
sponsible.

Wrapping that gift also raises
some important points. Do not use
wrapping paper on your gifts. After
you unwrap them, the paper is just
thrown together into a bag and put
out by the curb.

The garbage collector then takes
your wrapping paper to the land-
ﬁll, where it takes up precious
space.

The PC way to wrap your presents
is to use newspaper.

When you tear the covering off
your gifts, you can then take the
newspaper in for recycling. Envi-
ronmental responsibility is still
important during the holiday sea-
son.

' Almost every time you go out to
a store, you will see and hear the
people from the Salvation Army

soliciting donations. In order to
stay PC, you must put something in
every pot you see.

_If you have no money, you must
have some kind of jewelry you can
donate.

The key is to give a little bit to
everyone who asks.

You also cannot forget how to
act at the holiday meal. You must
be careful not to overconsume, but
I made that point before. But if you
are having turkey for your dinner,
there are some important things to
consider. ,

When selecting your meat, you
should select at least an equal
portion of dark and white. You can
really be PC if you take more dark
meat at this meal to make up for all
of the white meat you ate in the
past. I

It is politically correct to right
your past wrongs. ‘

Now make sure you cut out this
article and keep it with you
throughout this holiday season. If
you follow my recommendations,
you can have a PC, sterile celebra-
tion this year.

The Pitt News.

Rndeness during holiday season unnerving

Walking past my television set a couple of
weeks ago, I could not help but hear what
sounded like a Christmas commercial. “Only
$19.95 during our once—a-year, holiday sale—a-
thon! Don’t miss out!”

Hearing that, I became extremely frightened.
Was it the middle of December already? Fran-
tically, I ran for a calendar because I was one of
those idiots‘ in line outside Thackeray on the
first day of registration. What if I had been in
line for six weeks?

According to my calendar, it was still the
beginning of November. This. leads us to an
important question: Why were Christmas ads
running in late October?

Unless you’re an Iraqi soldier just now climbing

from your bomb shelter or you have Ronald

Reagan disease (complete loss of memory), you
have probably noticed the Christmas season
arriving earlier in the year, every year. This
joyous sale—a—thon is sparked by our beloved
friends in the retail industry.

Every year these companies go to war with
each other in order to get your dollar. Every
item on the market becomes “the Christmas gift
Dad can’t do without.” 9

I am sure my father will make it through the
903 without the--Super-Duper Holiday Toilet
Plunger, autographed and endorsed by Santa
Claus himself.

Waave become so alienated from the true
meaning of Christmas that I am not sure if I
actually know the “true meaning.” Every year
we get bombarded by new and worse Christ-
mas TV specials. ,

I find it hard to believe that Bart Simpson can
convey the significance of the Christ-child’s
birth while ramming Homer upside the head

Tim
Desmond

with a baseball bat.

Many people call me a scrooge. “Lighten up,
Tim. Enjoy Christmas, Tim. Get in the spirit,
Tim.” Bah-humbug. I’m no scrooge.

These people rationalize by saying, “Christ-
mas is a time of peace and goodwill among all
men. It is also a wonderful occasion for
children.” And the pope doesn’t wear a funny
hat.

First of all, children care about one thing and
one thing only: toys.

Think back to your own childhood; I’ll bet
you were laying in bed at 4 a.m. wondering
what Santa brought you, not contemplating any
kind of historical component of Christmas.
Children know Christmas as a day in late
December when some fat guy in goofy clothes
delivers toys to their door.

You "could substitute the name Christmas Day

- with David Duke Day, and it wouldn’t change

a thing for children. (Isn’t a former Klan leader
running for governor the seventh sign of the
Apocalypse?) '

The idea of “peace and goodwill among all
men” is a definite reality. People always get
along during the holiday season. (Gasp!) I
fondly remember one incident at the mall
last Christmas which should illustrate my
point.

The traffic light on the road that leads out of
the mall parking lot turned yellow, so I slowed
down and stopped when it turned red. The

gentleman in the car behind mine began honking
his horn in exalted jubilation. In even further
excitement, this happy young man started sing-
ing Christmas carols with much enthusiasm. I

could tell they were Christmas carols because I -

read his lips in my rear—view mirror. He even
had the decency to wave to me as his car passed
mine. The poor fellow must have been in a
terrible woodshop accident because I only saw
one finger up on his hand. Nevertheless, it
didn't spoil his holiday cheer.

Just exactly what needs to be done to recapture
the true meaning of Christmas is vague. Maybe
Nintendo should put a new video game on the
market: Attack of the baby Jesus. The object
would be to get the three wise dudes to home
base in Israel before Super Mary and Jumpin’

Joseph make it to the stable. If it’s a Nintendo

game, kids will give it their attention.

The process of rediscovering the most beautiful
holiday of the year is a difficult task. The steps
taken to do so are another topic. The point is
simply identifying the problem which a large
segment of the population does not realize
exists. This Christmas se on, as you enter the
mall's war zones and par ng hazards and deal
with joyous human being (like the fellowl met
last year), try to ask yourself what the under-
lying reason for all the sales could be. Surplus
proﬁt due to massive consumer purchasing\is
not the reason I'm talking about.

For an extended version of this column, send
me $19.95 (check or money order) to The Pitt
News. That’s right! Only $19.95 during our once-
a—year, holiday sale—a—thon! Don’t miss out!

Pitt falls to NC. State, 78- 77, as Gugliotta shines

By Ryan Buncher
Sta1fWrlter

Pitt will find itself facing some

“familiar opponents in the NCAA

volleyball tournament this
weekend.

Big Ten champion Ohio State,
the 12th-ranked team in the
country with a 27-3 record overall,
is the first hurdle. The Panthers
upset the Buckeyes in the first
round of the tournament last
season.

“We're excited,” said head
coach Sue Woodstra. “We feel
good about playing them. We’re
in the same situation as last year,
and we did well then, so we can

use that for confidence.”

Ohio State has not lost since
Sept. 13 at Notre Dame. OSU did
not lose a home match all season.
They were also undefeated in Big
Ten play.

The Buckeyes, like the Panthers,
are a balanced team with four
players averaging over four kills
per game.

Julie Chellevoid, a 5—foot, 9-
inch senior outside hitter, is the
team leader in kills per game with
4..O8. She also has a team—leading
410 digs.

The other three are 6-0 senior
middle blocker Leisa Wissler
(5.18), S—1O first-year outside hitter
Carrie Leonard (2.46) and 5-10

Whaley.

Ricardo McDonald.

Six Panthers receive
post-season honors

lnside linebacker Tom Tumulty was named the ECAC
Defensive Rookie ofthe Year last week, and five other Panthers
were also named ECAC All-Stars.

Tumulty, a true first-year student from Penn Hills High
School, started every game this season and finished with 84
tackles, 49 unassisted. He placed third on the team in both
categories, behind sophomores Charles Williams and Doug

The other Pitt players receiving All—Star honors were junior
defensive end Sean Gilbert, defensive backs Whaley and Steve
‘Israel, offensive tackle Scott Miller and outside linebacker

‘In addition, Whaley and tight end Dave Moore were named
to separate Academic All—American squads. Whaley was one of
22 players selected to the District II GTE Academic All-America
Team, votediby-College Sports ‘Information Directors of America.
The sophomore from Upper St. Clair High School ranked
«second on the team in tackles.

‘Moore was listed under the inaugural College Football
Association Scholar—Athlete Team, which is chosen by a panel
j of faculty, administrators, coaches, academic advisers and
1 sports-information directors. Moore set a team record this
season for receptions by a tight end, with 51. The senior from
New Jersey ranks ninth on Pitt’s all—time receptions list.

Tom Gugliotta scored 25 points,
including the game-winning free
throw with 6.9 seconds left, to lift
North Carolina State to a 78-77
victory over Pitt last night in
Hartford, Conn.

Gugliotta and Wolfpack center
Kevin Thompson, who scored
20, ensured the Panthers of a
third straight loss in the ACC/ Big
East Challenge series. Pitt falls to
3-2, while N.C. State improved to
3-0.

The Panthers held the lead
throughout most of the first half,
but they surrendered it on a pair
of Thompson free throws with
less than 16 minutes left. From
then on the Wolfpack took control
of the game, using the 6-foot, 9-
inch Gugliotta as ball-handler and
chief offensive threat. The senior
had nine points at the half but hit
six shots, including three three-
pointers, after intermission.

Pitt remained close, trailing by
one at the eight-minute mark.
But State went on a 7-0 run to
boost their lead to 74-66. Gugliotta

first-year outside hitter Gabrielle
Jobst (2.35). ‘

Another similarity between the ‘

teams is that both have 5-8 first-
year setters: Annemarie Mernagh
for Pitt and Laura Davis for Ohio
State.

A victory at Columbus might
give Pitt a third shot at 16th-
ranked Penn State, which has
beaten the Panthers twice this
year

The Nittany Lions will host 20th-
ranked Colorado in the first round
of the tournament. The sight for
the regional matches has not been
set, but it will probably be the
home of the highest-seeded team
remaining after the first round.
Nebraska is the top seed in the
region.

Woodstra said she isn’t even
thinking about another meeting
with Penn State but added, “It
would be fun.”

The Panthers enter the
tournament after a tough
weekend.

They lost both matches in the
New Mexico Tournament,
dropping their overall record to
28-8 and dropping them from the
Top 20.

In addition, Big East Player of
the Year Ann Marie Lucanie
injured her right ankle once more
and returned from the trip on
crutches.

Eighth-ranked New Mexico
took three close games Friday
night by scores of 16-14, 15-12,
15-8.

The Lobos were just more
proficient in all phases of the
game, with a better hitting
percentage (.248 compared to
.155 for Pitt), more digs (67 to 51)
and better serving (six aces and
three errors compared to three

aces and 10 errors).
See Volley, page 10

picked up his fourth foul with
five minutes left but stayed in the
game the entire way. Pitt pulled
within two, 74-72, butThompson,
Migjen Bakalli, Lakista McCuller
and Gugliotta all hit one of two
free-throw tries for the Wolfpack’s
final points.

With 1:24 remaining, Jerry
McCullough made one of two
attempts from the foul line, tying
the score at 77. After a failed Pitt
possession, Gugliotta grabbed the
rebound, took it down the lane
and was fouled, setting up the
winning free throw.

Pitt first-year player Chris Gant
had six points down the stretch
to keep the Panthers alive, but
Chris McNeal missed three straight
follow shots underneath the
basket that would have given Pitt
the lead. McNeal finished with 11
points, while Sean Miller led the
team with 17.

Both teams played sloppy
basketball, missing open shots
and turning thevball over often.
But the all-around talent of
Gugliotta (who also collected
eight boards, four assists and six
steals) proved to be too much for

Pitt. The three-point shot ﬁgured
heavily in both team’s plans: Miller
and Gugliotta each nailed four of
their team’s nine treys.
McCullough had 10 points,
including three three-pointers,
while N.C. State’s Bakalli scored
18.Even.though Gugliotta finished
with 25, he had only one point in
the last seven minutes, as Antigua
played excellent defense.

Pitt first-year players Gant,
Antigua and McCullough
combined for 24 points in
extensive action, but the
inexperience of each showed.
Antigua shot four of 10 from the
ﬂoor, while McCullough and Gant
each contributed to the team’s
variety of bad passes.

In the opening game,
Connecticut defeated Wake
Forest, 84-75, in front of a partisan
crowd.

The series continues tomorrow
night with games at The Omni in
Atlanta, Ga. Florida ‘State faces
Syracuse, and Georgia Tech takes
on Villanova. Pitt returns home
to Fitzgerald Field, House to play
St. Francis on Wednesday at 8

War oztbome ma/ees

By Chris Franklin
Staﬂ“ Writer

Stress is everywhere in this day
and age. For most college students
it appears when studying for
exams or writing papers. For
college athletes it appears on the
court or field as well as in the
classroom.

For Pitt junior forward Dominic
Dumancic stress is much more
than the above.

During Pitt’s basketball
practices and games, Dumancic,
21, has faced the added burden
of war in his homeland of
Yugoslavia.

“It’s'deﬁnitely been the most
difficult semester for me,” said
Dumancic, whose country has
been at war with itself since June.
“Sometimes when I study, I say to
myself, ‘Should‘I go to class or
not?’ I usually do, but so much
depends on what happens over
there.”

“There” is Zagreb, Yugoslavia,
which is part of the western
republic of Croatia. Serbia, which
wants to preserve the federation,
is at war with Croatia because of
Croatia's claim of independence.

Dumancic’s family has seen the
war from a front-row seat on a
few occasions. His grandmother
was injured by shrapnel from jet
fire but has since recovered. His
younger brother, Davorin,
narrowly escaped a bombing raid
near his home. While the fighting
near Zagreb had calmed down
for a period, it has just recently
intensified again.

By remaining at Pitt during the
war, Dumancic said both he and
his family are better off.

“There’s not too much I can do
to help. I’d be in the house waiting

vi-

in the basement — it’s just the
same routine,” Dumancic said.
“Not only that but my parents

;only get $100 a month for both of

them. There would be more

pressure on them with me there.” _\
Dumancic came to the United

States as an exchange student for
his senior year of high school at
Meadville. Dumancic excelled on
the court, leading Meadville to
the District 10 championship.
However adapting to American
life was much more difficult.

“Meadville was hard for me,”
he said. “For six months I was
always asking, ‘Why do you do
this?’ and ‘Why do you do that?”

Not only was Dumancic having
trouble with understanding
American behavior, but he also
had difficulty with the language.
Dumancic was taught English for
seven years in elementary and
high school but “couldn’t put two
sentences together.” To help him
learn the language, Dumancic’s
legal parents at Meadville forced
the issue on him by making him
read the newspaper.

“They made me read the
political section all the time. I
hated it, but I guess it came
along,” Dumancic said in ﬂuent
English.

Once Dumancic enrolled at Pitt,
his language problem was still
evident, however. He took the
SAT and scored below the NCAA
minimum. After takingan English
language course, Dumancic
satisfied his SAT requirement.

The NCAA failed to
acknowledge his new score.
According to Dumancic, the
Yugoslavian embassy required
him to have fu1l,—time status at Pitt
or his visa would expire. This
forced him to‘ enroll within a

week without his new score.

Dumancic finally saw his first
action as a Panther last year. He
made five of nine ﬁeld goals
while appearing in four games.

“I was just really happy to play
after a year and a half,” he said.

The three—point shot is easily
Dumancic’s biggest strength on
the hardwood. Last year he made
two of four three—pointers. At
Meadville he made an astounding
70 three—pointers. Not bad for
someone who’s 6-feet, 10-inches.

This season head coach Paul
Evans plans to move Dumancic
from small forward to power
forward.

“It’s another test for me,”
Dumancic said. “There’s more
rebounding and posting up. I’m
not sure it’s for me, but I’ll give it
my best.”

Dumancic should see more
action this year on a youthful Pitt
squad and said he believes the
team has something to prove.

“We want to ‘prove to the Big
East people thatwe’re not number
nine,” Dumancic said regarding
negative preseason predictions.
“They think that because there’s
no stars on the team, we’re not
good. But this team works hard
and will surprise a lot of teams
this year.”

Today Dumancic is no longer
the “pain—in—the-ass bad boy” he
was when he was younger.

“I’ve matured a lot,” Dumancic
said. “Being away from home has
helped. In this [American] system,
things are taken much more
seriously.”

That maturity has guided
Dumancic in choosing priorities,
of which number one is to earn a
degree; something that couldn’t
be done in Yugoslavia while

playing basketball.

“It’s impossible to be both a
student and a player back home.
You have to choose one. But I
ask, ‘What are you going to do
after basketball?’ This is why [Pitt]
is the perfect setting for me.”

Dumancic plans to play
basketball after graduation if given
the opportunity, which will most
likely come from Europe.
Dumancic said the decision will
be hard because of his numerous
relationships in the area.

Whatever Dumancic does after
leaving Pitt, you can bet he will
overcome any hardships
associated with his decision. After
all, he’s done it before.

SPRING REAK!

1  I ~ I ' - THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, December 3, 1991

Simple message to Steelers memozgememﬂ Get 61 clue 

Let’s get this straight: The
Steelers have the talent to be
contenders, but they are nowhere
near being anything more than
mediocre. I know, I am making
even less sense than usual. Let
me explain.

The use of talent on this team
is a joke. Chuck Noll, as has been
represented in other local
publications, seems to have lost
all interest in being anything more
than an administrator. The hands-
On coach that won four Super
Bowls is gone.

This is not to blame Noll. He
should be the coach as long as he
wants. Hiring a general manager
to take the administrative duties
and let Noll just coach would
help. Some may balk at taking
the drafting responsibilities away
from the coach, but the system
the team has used the last 10
years or so has not worked. Recent
blunders such as Aaron Jones
over Thurman Thomas and Tim
Worley over Andre Rison show
that a new view is necessary.

The real problem on this team
is the offensive and defensive
coordinators. They are too much

in love with their systems, which
just don't fit the talent on this
team.

Offensive coordinator Joe
Walton’s system is extremely
effective when run to precision,
but this team can’t do that, and
few others could. The offensive
line and running backs are still
better suited to the old trapping
game that Walton has all but
abandoned. Fullback Merrill Hoge
was a dominating force in the
1989 playoffs, the year before
Walton came, but he has been
less and less effective since. He
still runs as hard, and arguments
that he wore himself out at age 26
are a joke. An offense featuring
the running of Hoge and Barry
Foster would be much more
effective than what is being run
now.

The passing attack has
problems of its own. The
discipline involved ruined
quarterback Bubby Brister by
taking away his aggressiveness.
Neil O'Donnell seems better
suited to it, but an offense like the
one the team used before Walton
might be better. The main criticism

Ryan
Buncher

is that even though it is a tight-
end oriented offense, Eric Green
just doesn’t get the ball enough.
The use of the position is designed
for a normal tight end who is a
good receiver, like former Jet
Mickey Shuler. Eric Green is no
normal tight end.

There are problems at offensive
line and wide receiver, but the
offensive system worsens them.
Many of the mistakes on the line
are due to the complexity of the
system. If it is too complex to get
rookie receivers Jeff Graham and
Ernie Mills on the field, it needs
to be changed.

This is not to say that Walton’s
system is totally unworkable —
just that he should adjust to the
talent on the team. Most helpful
of all would be to upgrade the
talent at wide receiver. Desmond
Howard or Carl Pickens would
really look great in a Steeler
uniform, and the way the Steelers
are going, they will be in a position

to get anybody they want.

Dave Brazil may have coached
the No. 1 defense in football last
year, but this year has pointed
out the weaknesses in the system.
Cornerback Dave Johnson has
struggled after a tremendous 1990
season.Often-released Richard
Shelton has been coming in as a
nickelback on third downs all
year and has been beaten
consistently, which is the main
reason for the defense’s problems
on third downs.

The pass rush is still weak. The
front seven just isn’t allowed to
be aggressive enough. Injuries to.
top pick Huey Richardson haven’t
helped. Neither has the time
outstanding young outside
linebacker Jerrol Williams has
spent on the sidelines. It is time
to get aggressive.

Former Eagles coach and Bears
defensive coordinator Buddy
Ryan isn’t doing anything, so bring
him in as defensive coordinator.
If you can’t get him, get someone
else who can coach that system.
Gerald Williams has developed
into a solid nose tackle, but he is
better suited to defensive tackle

in a four-man front. So would the
rest of the linemen, who are
relatively small. Richardson could
be used as a stand-up end/pass-
nisher like Richard Dent or Chris
Doleman.

Ryan’s defense also allows
aggressive play by the outside
linebackers, very fitting for Jerrol
Williams and Greg Lloyd. Inside
linebackers Dave Little, Hardy
Nickerson andJerry Olsavsky are
all well-suited to middle
linebacker.

The 46 defense puts the
pressure on the secondary, and
that is the strength of this defense.
Cornerback Rod Woodson is the
best in the business. The safeties
have to be able to cover man—to-
man and back up the aggressive
front, things Carnel Lake and
Thomas Everett can do. ,

Chuck Noll’s coaching and a
few outstanding players have kept
the franchise from hitting bottom,
but it is time to change the system
to allow the team to move up.
Teams that adjust to the talent on
their rosters are the ones that
win. Simply put: Steelers, get a
clue.

Pitt lost that consolation match
