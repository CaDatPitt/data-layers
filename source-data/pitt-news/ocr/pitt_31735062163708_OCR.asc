JJNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

  Editorial: Va te No!

There can be no doubt that_ anyone. W110 has afly
faith in the democratic system under which _we live
should be outraged at the recent proposed amendments

»which Student Government is putting up for Student

ratiﬁcation" Wednesday.

Should the student body okay the new amendments,
it will have forever destroyed the possibility of its being
able to exert any restraint on the activities of the SG.

According to the new amendment, whenever mne-
tenths of the Senate (not'the student body) shal_l'aP'
prove ‘of an amendment it shall become part of the con-
stitution. , - _ ’

Under this clause, the SG will never have to go to

..the student body again ifit desires to change the con-

stitution. If the Senate would decide’ to add a clause.
stating that nobody except fraternity members would

‘be, allowed to run for SG, there would be no possible
’ means of stopping them. ' '

Such a clause would establish the possibility for a.
clique to take complete control of the SG. A government
of any type can only be considered safe for human con-

sumptionif it possesses some vehicle whereby the mas- ,_
‘ ses of voters can change it if it becomes corrupt or
‘otherwise unﬁt.

Such an amendment as SG proposes possesses no

1 such vehicle. What is to stop SG from declaring the new A
amendment null and void by the prescribed nine-tenths

majority as soon as it becomes law? Absolutely nothing?
Then there would be no way for the constitution never
to be changed. And don’t think that a group of popu-
larly elected students is above such a move. Didn’t the
present SG ‘defeat a motion to put a new constitution
on the ballot by a nine—tenths majority —-— the premise
majority necessary under the new amendment to defeat
any proposed change? 1

This move is, exactly the same as taking thevote
away from the student body. What’s to stop SG —-— once ,
the amendment is passed —-— from declaring that there
will be no more elections and that the present SG shall
select its successors? Absolutely nothing! 1,

A parallel situation existed in. Germany when Hit-
ler came to power in 1933. He convinced the President
of the Republic that in order to avoid the bother of going
to the people wheneverva change was necessary, he
should be given full power to. change wh tever he
thought was needed. This is what SG is asking the stu-

I dentlbody to do and although it is ridiculous to com-
“ pare SG to Hitler, the parallel never the less exists.

Don’t permit SG to take away what little power it
now concedes to the student body. Vote ‘N 0’ on Monday.

Up Again For SG Discussion

By NANCY FUCHS

The question of the four amendments to the constitution of Student Government
passed at the previous meeting was re-opened Thursday night owing to a feeling that

passage of the amendments was hastily accomplished. In a three hour meetingisenators re- ‘ 

hashed‘ the amendments, passed one motion, defeated one, and tabled three. . ‘ ‘

Les Plack started the ball rolling by moving that the amendments not be put into ef- 
fect until after the election. He pointed out that the amendment reducing the number of _ 

senators by 3 would necessitate a cut of members on a party slate. In agreement Emily

Kleiman stated, “There is no use in carrying over

The voting will take place friome 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at
special booths in CL, SU, and Engineering Hall. A

One of the amendments limits the number of senators to

eligibility for presidential and vice-presidential candidates.
Mimi Meyers, Elections Chairman, said that those who are in-

eligible under the present constitution but would be eligible

under the new set-up should also pick up thepetitions.
Thusfar 44 students have picked up petitions for var-
ious oﬁices. They are broken up as follows: twp for presi-
dent, one for vice-president, and 31 for senatorial seats.
Of, these, 32 are LA, four for E. & M. and Education’ and

‘one’ is for Business. Miss Meyers said petitions can still be

picked up at the Dean of Men’s oﬁice, especially,-she urged,
for the candidates for Pharmacy and Nursing. _

/5 A ' t
 Bradford Regional

By NANCY FUCHS

Students at regional cam-
puses other than Bradford
have complained that college
life for them is little different
from high school. But as one
Bradford student commented,
“You can make it different if
you try.” And their Student

Cabinet is doing just that.
‘The eleven 'members of the
Cabinet, elected ‘by the student
body, include a representative
from each dormitory and four
non—resident students. The Consti-
tution calls for only two non-
residents on the Cabinet, but a

"tie resulted in the doubling of the

number.

'All of the oﬁicers are in a
unique position; they are techni-
cally only temporary because their
constitution requires that they
_have 24 credits behind them.
Constitution Problems
Writing a constitution from
scratch posed a problem for the
students, and communication be-

A tween the Cabinet and the rest of

the student,body has been one
ever since. According to Denny
Lowery, Cabinet chairman‘, _“A re-
quired orientation period was held

‘ once a week last term. At the

meeting Mr. Whalen, assistant to

.Dr. Swarts, told us what was go-

ing on.”

1', , “However,” he continued, stu-
dents resented compulsory at-

tendance and it was dropped-
Now the Cabinet is reviving the
orientation period, but it will be
optional and will be held every
two weeks. It is easier than
having a notice up on the bulle-
tin board.”
A mimeographed news paper

, called The Cab Crier and edited

by a married student was distrib-
uted for a while, but/few students

- had journalistic experience and in-
- terest waned, causing Publicatmn

to stop. Dr. Swarts dropped a hint

« about getting a paper printed.

and since he was director ‘of stu-
dent publications at the University

’ the newspaper may be . revived
' soon.

. Main Project _

The Student Cabin<_et’S main
project is the organization of ac-
tivities, although it has done such
things as getting the Tuck. Shop

"C to serve hamburgers, hot dogs.

"and milkshakes all day long and

, setting up a Student _ Judicial

Board to review cases involving
- students, and recommending ac-
- tion to the faculty-

Besides ‘being’ hampered by
the lack of interest on the part
of the student body and the
ratio of one woman student to
ﬁve men, their activities are
limited by ﬁnancial considera-
tion. The Cabinet can not ex-
pect to be showered with ap-
propriations the first year or to
work at the financial level of

 Student Government here.
In the past the Cabinet had_

planned one activity a weekend
such as a hootenany with stu_-
dents providing music. However,

.in order to ‘attract more student
interest they scheduled a variety ‘
'of activities two wekends ago.

Students could ski or ice‘ skate

. during the day and go to a hoote-
nany in the evening.

Basketball Game
The nextbig project is'a fac-

  

 

 

‘ from the ﬂoor.

ulty-student basketball game open
to_students, families, and friends.
Female members of the faculty
and student body will be “cheer-
leaders. Everyone seemed to be
looking forward to this activity
which it is hoped will raise funds
to start other activities.

The Cabinet is interested-in
renting movies, ‘similar to the
ones shown in Clapp Hall on
Friday nights. There is only one
theater open in Bradford.

Student leaders are ‘optimistic.
According to one, “Things are
moving now. This summer there
will be a core of kids who will set
up activities so things will run
smoothly in the fall.”

Debate Club
Students are also trying to or-
ganize a bowling league, chess
club,.and debate club. The eight
members of the debate club have
nodebating experience, but under

the guidance of a political science
professor, they hope to learn
basic skills in time to go to a
novice tournament here in March.
Some of them heard the William
Pitt Debate Union debate against
Notre Dame in Bradford a few
weeks ago. ‘

listen to a question raised

According ‘to one student,
“The Pitt News is the only con-
nection we have with the main
campus. Last ‘trimester students
just lived for the weekends in
Pittsburgh.” , Bradford 1 students
were curious about the activi-
ties of groups on the main cam-
pus, especially SG._ ’

They_ asked questions about the
size of classes and the amount of
outside preparation. Some felt “it
is easier to get distribution'sub-
jects ‘out of the way here where

you can get more personal atten-
tion with required subjects that
do not interest you.”— ~

M 1 Last Two Years

They agreed that the last two
years of college should be spent
at a"large school because “it puts
you on your own.”'However there
are others -who have already had
the unfortunate experience of
“getting lost in a big school and
big city when, before you realize
you are lost’ academically.”

There are those who lodk to-
ward greater independence of the
regional campus, but when they
stop to think about it, they re-
member, “We-’re only a year old.
We're hardly crawling yet.”

  

  

RibicoffToReintroduce
Student Tax Proposal

Although defeated in the Senate, the controversial tax credit
proposal for college, students, sponsored by Sen. Abraham Ribi-
coff, D—Conn., has not been quelched' entirely.

Not only has the senator pledged to bring the bill up again

. for vote next year, but a similar tax allowance will be included
in the amendment to extend the National Defense Education Act
(NDEA) during the currentsession of the House.

The new proposal would allow a deduction from the total
income on which tax is based, thus lowering the income tax
bracket of the individual. The already defeated proposal would
have subtracted a deduction from the amount of the tax to

be paid.

Primary Objection

Primary objection to the Ribicoff amendment stemmed from _
the nature of the proposal, a tax relief for middle—income fami-,. ~

lies.

“Low [income families do not pay enough taxes to benefits‘

from this type of credit allowance,” one critic said. .
Francis Keppel, U. ‘S. Commissioner of Education,
maintained that the most pressing need in the area of fed-
eral aid to education, “the opportunity for low-income
families to send their children to college,” is ignored by the

original "proposed tax credit.

According to Ribicoff, the bill was directed toward the
‘ “underprivileged middle class.” If passed, it would have allowed
a tax credit of up to $750-a-year for payment of tuition, fees,

books and supplies.

A - Pete Bijur, Martha Holstein, Les Plack, Joe
', Seiger, Stan Stein, and Matt Swetonic are six
:'",student leaders who were quite concerned about
"what’s going to happen at this place after they
graduate.
The inetﬁciency of Student Government both-
cred them; the fact that the system cannot pos-
' sibly do what it purports to do annoyed them
.even more. And they saw little new blood re-
placing the crop of leaders graduating this April.
They slammed into The Pitt News editorial
Vofﬁce the night of January 9, and they wanted to
"start a riot. A book-burning, a protest march, a
raid —- something that would excite the students
and maybe in turn spur, some of the organizations
on campus.
 It was a typical chaotic discussion in a typi-
. cal smoke-ﬁlled room. _
Out of it came the University Council.
_ A senator cornered me after the Student Gov-
ernmentmeeting last week when the Senate turn-
» ed_ down the proposal for the Council and scream-
.ed, “Doesn’t The Pitt News want to do anything
but destroy. Did you have to ‘plot this in a back
\room?” . . _ A
She couldn’tyunderstand that people have "to
be steamed up before they can act. She couldn’t
understand that a radical change was needed to
effect anything of meaning. She couldn’t under-
stand that The Pitt News had, destroyed only to

planning. -' "

The procedure was changed to include the A

presidents of six major organizations on the nomi-
nating board to insure a representative selection.
And any student at _all could apply for
membership.

LA cabinet member Steve Johnson and Martha
Holstein approached SG_ President Marty Landy,
and at the senate’s last meeting in January he
announced that the following week he would
have one plan for them to consider for the re-
vision of Student Government.

The following Monday" Landy met with the
other seniors involved and in a ﬁnal eifort to
gain his support and get as much through of the
original ideas as possible, the group compro-
mised almost 50-50 with the present SG eon-
stitution. A u

The most hopeful correction was that the
president of the Council, elected among the mem-
bers, would appoint a committee of top graduating‘

.seniors to nominate a slate of 15 to 20 to present

to the student body in a popular élection for the
election of 11. ‘

But even the compromise was worthless when
Landy withdrew his support, got together with
his compatriots, and whipped up four amend-
ments between that Monday night and their
Thursday meeting. ' ' » « ‘

The University Council was before its time for
most of the students here. And for good reason.

It seems general opinion that Student Govern-
ment elections are a farce. For the most part
they have been based on popularity,‘ and even
individual voting has been based on the fact that
the voter either knows the person or was told
to vote for him.

Many feel the, same way about civil elections.

But there is one diﬁerence. National elections.
include a clearing house, a party convention
which screens candidates, a nominating committee
-- with essentially the same purpose as the Coun-
cil plan to secure the most qualiﬁed slate for the
voter who is not in the position to do this for

I himself, to help the voter make an intelligent‘

K

decision. .

But, as Jim Kleinberg and Steve Johnson
pointed out before the ﬁnal _compromise, the stu-
dents will not think ‘of this, but rather that they
are losing that traditional part of their indi-
viduality, the place they have their big toes in
American democracy — their votes. Unfortunate-
ly the Senate saw only this that night.

What the Senate did, though, is not the ques-
tion now. Only one fact should still be noted -
who had a part in presenting the plan. The same
group that was out to “destroy” SG only started
its attacks after January 9 when it had some-
thing concrete it could offer to remedy the flaws
it saw.

involved in sports betting. The
number engaged in this pastime
are few, _but they are of some
signiﬁcance. To anyone who may
have formed a false impression
because of my statement, I apolo-
gize.

, Contrary to popular opinion, the
main ingredient in sports betting
is not the bookmaker or the odds-
maker. It is the bettor himself
who is the key to the entire opera-
tion. Without him the bookmakers
and oddsmakers could not sur-

As I said previously, people
bet forithree reasons — kicks,
money, and emotional need. The
ﬁrst type is the person who has
money, and needs something to
do with, it. Usually, nothing

The second type, those who do
it to win money, is more common.
An acquiantance once told me,
“If you know something about a
game and you don’t make money
off it, you’re a jerk.” These peo-
ple usually know what they’re
doing when it comes to the actual
betting. There are people who
make good money, but they are a’
rare breed. They take advantage
of knowledge they possess and
turn it into cold cash.

The bettor who wagers because
of an emotional. need_ is the most
predominant of the three types.

I have observed several predict-

emerge in the sports gambler.
The sports bettor is a self-stated
expert in one or more branches
of major sports. Over half his
conversation is about sports. He
feels he has a superior know-
ledge over everyone in this
ﬁeld, and tries to apply it in
order to improve his ﬁnancial
status.

Another acquaintance who in-
dulges in betting once told me,
‘‘You’ll very rarely see me play-
ing cards, and you’ll never see me
at a dice, roulette, or blackjack
table. Those are all luck. This is
skill.”

The bookmakers and oddsmak-

Men's Dorm Council

Editor, The Pm News:

At last Wednesday
night’s meeting . of the
Men’s Dormitory Council‘,
the dormitory representa-
tives voted 14 to 1 in op-
position to the four amend-
ments to the Student Gov-
ernments constitution pro-
posed by Student Govern-
ment. ' .

The general feeling of
the Men’s Dormitory Coun-
cil was that as the repre-
sentative body of the men

residence students, the

Council should make an ef-
fort to express the dissatis-
faction of its constituents.
The amendments were crit-
icized as:

1) defeating the pur-

pose of a representative
Student Government. by
taking the power of
amendment from the stu-
dent body which it sup-
posedly represents, and
putting this power into
-the hands of .4% (20 sen-
ators) of the undergrad-
uate population.

2) giving" each year’s
Student Government the

3) an obvious attempt
on the‘ part; of this year’s
Student Government to

‘ “railroad”
.sons into office by chang-
' ing the requirements for
the oﬂice "of President
and Vice_-President, by
assuming the power to

tailor-make the constitu- ,

tion and by throwing up
,a smokescreen in delet-
ing from the constitution
certain clauses regarding
power _ which ‘Student
Government has never
really had. ‘
We of the‘Men’s Dormi-

dent body should'be made
aware of the dangers inher-

I don’t think I will be stating
a bold fact when I say that

there is a certain type of movie

son who attends the cinema has
a particular‘ reason for wanting
to see a particular picture and
after awhile the person builds
up a pattern or habit of movie

last year's popular ﬁlm, “To Kill

All of the above talents have
blended together to give us a
very touching, sometimes starkly
realistic, sometimes highly amus-
ing, story about two people
caught in the clutches of New
York City. Natalie Wood - is a
Macy’s salesgirl with a problem.
Her problem is the factgthat dur-
ing the summer she met_McQueen
whom she went to bed with only
once, and the‘ poor‘ girl learns
that she is pregnant. Her natural
inclination is to ﬁnd “the proper

stranger” and tell him the happy
news. She locates McQueen, a
musician-without-job, tells him,
and learns that he doesn’t even
remember her. She decides on
an abortion and asks him to ﬁnd
a “doctor.” The major portion of

the ﬁlm concerns Miss Wood’s

attempt to ﬁnd a husband after
the abortion plan has exploded
in a terror-ﬁlled scene.

It is a well organized ﬁlm and
one that moves slowly but surely.
The ﬁlm switches from tense

drama to light comedy in the ﬁ-

nal half and even though the
ending is predictable the means
to that end are dealt with by
a. group of real professional
moviemakers. The settings of
New York provide the realistic
backdrop‘ for the events and I
was fortunate during the past
summer to see some of the foot-
age being shot in and around the

Macy area of 34th street. The

script by Schulman is tight, di-

rect, and fascinating.‘ It is a sim-’

ple tale about simple people but
the characters change and their
story ‘changes with remarkable
skill. ‘

Natalie Wood has never been
better and I believe that in “Love
With The Proper Stranger,” she

surpasses her ﬁnest performance

to-date, that of the love-torn girl
in "Splendor in the Grass.”

For Invitation

If the pattern of this past year holds true, then the Panther
basketball team will not receive a bid to a post-season -tourna-

ment and make it a clean sweep for the baseball, football and‘

basketball teams.

Last spring, Bobby Lewisihad his second ﬁne baseball team‘

in a row, but was not invited to the NCAA’ Tournament./The
injustice to thefootball team merited them “The Loser of the
Week” award in Los Angeles. All that remains now is for the
basketball team not to receive a bid and the year will be com-
plete.

While it seems more probable that the team will be invited
to the NIT and not the NCAA, the politics of the selection com-
mittees keep the situation in doubt.‘ The Panthers are one of four
teams that are being considered for the two at_1arge bids to the
NCAA. ' ' ‘

Villanova seems certain to get one of them. The other two teams
are St. Bonaventure and New York University, the Panthers open-
ing round opponent in last year’s NCAA. Both St. Bonaventure
and NYU lost over the weekend,-thus enhancing the Panthers
chances. , ‘

Might Get Two Bids

There is also the possibility that a situation similar to last
year will occur. That is; the‘ Panthers will get invited to both
the. NCAA and the NIT tournaments. If it happens, then the
Panthers will choose the NCAA.

“There is no conﬂict at all/,’ said athletic director Frank
Carver. “We are a member of the NCAA and are obligated to
support it. That is why we didn’t accept the NIT bidlast year,
but waited until we heard from the NCAA.” ,

Tournament bids open today. The Panthers 14-6 record,
however, might cause the committees to defer their judgment
until after the Temple game at the Field House Wednesday. The
Owls are also seeking an NIT bid and could get it with a win
Wednesday. '

After Pitt’s, 78-70, win over Fordham in New- York, Johnny
Bach, Fordham coach and head of the NIT selection committee
said, “Pitt is a good team that doesn’t lose its poise. They are a
tournament team, one that would be an/exciting team to watch.”

Everyone Wants NIT

Last season both the players and the students wanted to go
to he NIT, feeling that the Panthers had a better chance of win-_
ning. The same holds_ true this year with Villanova, one of the
top ten teams in the country, being the probable opening round
opponent in the NCAA.

With the opening round of the NCAA being played at the

Palestra in Philadelphia, Villanova will have the advantage of"

the home court.

After the Syracuse win here Saturday, coach Bob Timmons
said, “We beat a good club today. We should get a tournament
bid. This year’s club has more experience than last years. We
have a better bench and I think we should do better in a
tournament.”

Despite the optimism of Johnny Bach, there is still the feel-
ing oi uncertainty. What happened to the number three football
team is all too fresh in the minds of local ‘fans. While the basket-

' ball team did not have as good a year as the football team, their

play this season should get them a bid.

Panthers Boost Record to 14-6;  d v
Tournament Hopes Look Good, 

‘By ART FLEISCHNER ,

Saturday afternoon’s 69-67 win over
Syracuse gave the Panther basketball
team a. split with the Orangemen this
year, a 14-6 record and a good chancefor a
tournament bid. '

. Panther coach Bob
' Timmons started list-
_ing the good job done
by each “of the play-
ers and then found
himself I saying, “It

fort. We really Want-

‘needed it if we are to

As has been custom— -
ary' this year, -Tim- FRED LEWIS
mons cited the job done by Cal Sheffield. Shef-
ﬁeld scored 26 points to lead the scorers. He also
made two foul shots to tie the game,'67-67, be-
fore Brian Generalovich put In the "winning
shot with six seconds remaining.

Shelﬁeld, who has drawn more and more
praise from Timmons for his defensive work.
held Syracuse’s star Dave Bing to four points
while he was covering him. .

 

Bing-also got four off of Dave Sauer and
six on loose balls as a result of jump balls.

Sauer guarded him for the ﬁrst half and most‘

of the second and completely stopped him.
“He’s one of the quickest players I’ve ever
guarded,” said Sauer. “I tried to keep him from
going to the baseline and Paul Krieger helped
pick him up near the middle and the foul line.’’
Bing, one of the most heralded, sophomores
in the country, drew praise from Carnegie
' Tech coach Mel Cratsley. Cratsley said, “He’s
better than Si Green because he can pass
better. He can do everything Ron Thorn
could do, but better.-I've never seen a better
sophomore.” ’ 4
Syracuse coach Fred Lewis, usually quite
talkative, ‘refused to comment on the game say-
ing only, “Pitt played a great game.”-
Lewis was perturbed by the fact that 6-foot-
8 Chuck Richards, who scored 34 points against
the Panthers at Syracuse, fouled out at 8:15.
Timmons said, “I sure was glad when that
Richards left. He beat us" the last time, but
Krieger and Bob Lovett held him this time.”
Sheﬁield became the -second member of this
year’s team to go over the 1000 point mark.

Bucknell, a team which
lost to the Panther swim-
mers, 71-24, last year, scored
a 52-43 win over Ben
Grady’s team Saturday at Buck-
nell. The loss put the Panthers’
record at 3-4, even though they
have virtually the same team
back from last season which
posted an 8-1 record.

Grady said it was “a very
strong‘ group of sophomores for
Bucknell” which brought about
the difference in scoring from
last year’s meet. _

Going into the last event of
the meet, the 400-yard free-
style relay, Bucknell led, 45-43.
Grady used Andy James, Ron
Levine, Rick Petterson and
Steve Ganong in the relay, but

day for Levine since he was
beaten earlier in the 200-yard
butterfly by Jim Smigie.
Grady excused that loss by
saying, “I told Ron to take
it easy in the butterﬂy since
I wanted to save him for the
free style relay. All we were
after in the fly was a. second
and third and that’s what we
got.”

Levine did win the 200-yard
individual medley with a time of

Andy James ‘won the 50
yard free style andtook a sec-

Grady said; “Andy had the‘

same time as Bruce Dove in
the 100 but the judges gave it
to Dove.” ~
Although a James win would
have meant only four points
in the ﬁnal score and the Pan-
thers lost by nine, Grady said,
“If James had won we could
have won the meet by changing

our men around.” He refused to
elaborate on his strategy, how-
ever.

was Don Hahnfeldt in the div-

TOTAL PERFORMANCE!

Somethiiig wonderful’s happened to Ford Motor

‘Company cars! Under the freshest styling seen in
years, there’s a new kind of durability and vigor that
:more than meets the demands of today’s and tomor-
yrow’s high—speed turnpike driving conditions.

,What’s the secret? Quality engineering for total per-
formance. Quality engineering so outstanding that
_Ford Motor Company received the NASCAR Achieve-

v ron-Bui cs Min THE CHALLENGE WITH

 

 

ment'Award for engineering excellence which “superbly
combines the prime essentials of great automobiles-—
performance, reliability, durability, comfort and safety.”

Total performance makes a world of difference. Bodies
and frames are solid and quiet even on the roughest
roads. The ride’s so smooth, so even-keeled, it seems
to straighten the curves and shorten the miles. And
nothing matches the spirit, sparkle and stamina of
advanced Ford-built V-8's and thrifty Sixes. Total
performance is yours to enjoy in all our 1964.» cars—from
the frisky Falcon to the matchless Lincoln Continental.)
