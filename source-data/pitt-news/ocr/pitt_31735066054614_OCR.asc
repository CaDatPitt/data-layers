udge culls mistrial in Gammage case

Rames_ Redd ‘

   

no \

The three-day trial testimony that
began Tuesday on the Jonny
Gammage case ended in a mistrial that
stunned the courthouse on Friday
morning.

The three-day case was filled with
despair as the Gammage family came
to the court to get justice for their 31-
year-old son who died while hand-
cuffed after a traffic stop on Route 51.
Two of the officers involved in the
stop, Brentwood officer Lt. Milton
Mulholland and Baldwin patrolman
Michael Albert, stood trial in the case

for involuntary manslaughter.

Yvonne Brown, one of the people
in the courtroom, said the case has
brought to light a fear many minori-

ties have.

“As a black“ person, I understand
the fear and uncertainty Jonny
Gammage had when he was pulled
over,” she said. “Jonny Gammage was
speeding through the lights because,
probably, he was afraid. You see in TV
not to stop in the middle. He probably
wanted to stop where there were lots

of people.”

There was a recess at noon as
spectators and reporters flooded the
third floor of the courthouse.

Gammage’s
Gammage, had even harsher accusa-
tions for the police.

“It was not an accident,” she said.
“They choked him  I would like the '
whole thing reenacted and done over.
If a person dies, I will believe it was
an accident.’

The defense attorneys argued that
Gammage’s death was an accident and
that he was handcuffed and left for so
long because he was struggling.

Thelma Quarles, a spectator at the

mother, Narves

trial, said that even if he did struggle,

it didn’t mean he was fighting the
arrest; he might have been fighting to

BiGaLA opens
doors to people in
and out of ’’closet”

Dawn Anderson

 

If you’ve seen some-
thing about BiGaLA and
thought it was a semi-annu-
al gala event, you won’t
need your festive clothes
and dancing shoes to
attend.

BiGaLA stands for
The Bisexual, Gay, and
Lesbian Alliance, and the
organization was estab-
lished in the rnid-70s to cre-
ate an environment that
would acknowledge and

A accept people with sexual

differences including gay
men, lesbians, bisexuals,
and transsexuals.

“In general, BiGaLA is
accepting of all people’s
differences. This would
include people who suffer
prejudices from sexism,
racism, and disabilities,”
said BiGaLA spokesperson
Kathleen Douglas.

The goal of BiGaLAis
to create a healthy and safe
atmosphere free of homo-
phobia on Pitt’s campus, to
diligently work towards
achieving equality while
educating the community,

and to promote the growth
of a warm environment that
will connect people with
the same interests.

“I know we cannot rid
ignorance, but so many
times, people in classrooms
make degrading comments
about homosexual people
and don’t realize that the
person sitting next to them
might be a homosexual,”
said Christian Baker, leader
of the organization. “Many
pwple don’t know that we
are here and what we stand
for.”

Due to the conﬁden-
tiality of the group, the
actual number of participat-
ing members cannot be dis-
closed, but the numbers
have decreased over the
years.

There have been sever-
al myths that might have
contributed to this problem.

Many people seem to think ’

the organization is a dating
service, counseling center,
or you have to be gay to be
a member.

“We need people to
ﬁnd out about us, and if
they are really interested,

SGB discusses
student safely
on campus

Alexa Sereﬂi

 

Whether you are stumbling

home bleary—eyed from the library '

after. a long night of studying or
unwinding with a drink at a party to
kick off the weekend, the Student
Government Board wants you to be
safe.

SGB member Justin DalMolin
expressed his concern about the
organizational structure of the cam-
pus escort service and the fact that
a relatively low percentage of‘stu-
dents are taking advantage of it.

Currently, the escort service is
considered a student activity, but it
would be more appropriately
referred to as a campus safety issue
to increase efficiency and defer
costs from Pitt’s Department of
Parking and Transportation.

The department gives the escort
service $10,000 for operation, and
only about 70 students are using the
service on a regular basis.

“If you do the math, it comes:

out to about $142 a walk. That’s an
expensive program,”~ said
DalMolin.

DalMolin said he is committed
to keeping and improving the escort
service and feels that it would be
better to put the service under the
heading of campus safety to ensure
that it is not cancelled.

Escort Adam Neary stressed the
importance of the service that he
and his peers provide and recom-
mended that awareness of the pro-
gram be increased.

“Although the numbers are low,
I know that the people that do call
are regulars and depend on the ser-
vice to get around campus,” said
Neary.

Yeltsin names new secretary
of Russian security council

Across the Nation

LOWELL, Mass. — The same
Colombian drug cartels that brought
cocaine to the U.S. are now expanding
into heroin trade. This trade is occurring
through the same distribution networks
that have been so successful for them in
the past, according to the Drug
Enforcement Agency. A
Instead of feeling any relief that
cocaine use seems tobe on the decline,
agency leaders worry that the decline may
only indicate a shift from cocaine to hero-
in. The number of “hard-core” heroin
addicts in the U.S. has risen from 500,000
to 600,000 in the past few years, accord-
ing to the DEA. The Washington Post

BALTIMORE — The NAACP has
completely paid off its debts after close to
two years of controversy.

Last year, the organization was $4
million in debt and still looking for a new
executive director, after Benjamin L.
Chavis was ﬁred for committing
$330,000 of NAACP funds without the
board’s approval to settle a suit filed
against him. Since he took ofﬁce in
February, President Kweisi Mfume has
revamped the group’s spending proce-
dures and organization structure. The

Around the World

MOSCOW — President Boris Yeltsin
named a former speaker of parliament,
Ivan Rybkin, secretary of the Russian
National Security Council.

Rybkin replaced Alexander Lebed,
who was dismissed Thursday. Lebed
fought with most of Yeltsin’s top lieu-
tenants and insulted them during news
conferences.

Officials said that Rybkin would stick
to the Chechen peace plan adopted by
Lebed and try to avoid anything that
would restart the war in that country,
which has already cost the lives of
300,000 —— mostly civilians. The
Washington Post

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia — Muslim
members of the newly—forrned Bosnian
Serb parliament refused to take the oath
of ofﬁce because they would have been
forced to vow allegiance to a Christian
God.

Muslim officials will appeal to parlia-
ment’s justice committee about the
Christian—on'ented oath. Fourteen of the
18 Muslims and one Croatian deputy
came to the next parliamentary meeting to
work but did not take the oath. The

“How come it takes all those
police to hold down one [person] ?” she
said. “He was suffocating and put up a
fight. Who wouldn’t if they were fight-
ing for life?”

Witnesses for the prosecution were
called to the stand, and James Holiday
and Sean Payne testified on behalf of
their late friend. They said Gammage
had only one beer that night and was
not drunk. They also said he had a
cold, which would have limited his
strength.

As the trial re-opened Wednesday
morning, Gammage’s cousin, Ray
Seals, and the EMT Team that attended
to Gammage, took the stand. Ray Seals
insinuated that the police planted mar-
ijuana found in

team testified that

were shackled,

“We are going to omit the politi-
cians and controlling powers of
Pittsburgh from our spending agenda. I
am going to try to see if I can help
motivate black people to not to spend a
dime in Pittsburgh, all right?” he said.
“If I can, I would like black people and
poor people not to buy anything in the
city of Pittsburgh that is not absolutely
necessary  Naturally, I would appre-
ciate if they would support black busi-
nesses. But I think until black people
in this city get justice, we need to omit
Pittsburgh from our spending.”

Later, Shabbaz started walking and
shouting, “Jonny Gammage did noth-
ing wrong. He was like coffee without
cream: too black, too strong!”

Meanwhile, the questioning inside
of Wecht became
intense as one of
the defense
lawyers, Patrick
J.» Thomassey,
asked Wecht to
“tell me what my

out on the ground client did --
previous to his what my client
death. did from A to Z.”

A surprise W e c h t
witness, Frank responded angri-

Belajac, a tow-
truck driver who
witnessed the
Gammage traffic
stop, stunned the
courtroom when he testified he saw
police officers start a fight with
Gammage.

Thursday came, and Belajac was
cross-examined by the defense. His
previous testimony in which he denied
witnessing the traffic stop was ques-
tioned by the defense putting a doubt
in the minds of jurors of his credibility.

The statements of the star witness
for the prosecution, County Coroner
Cyril Wecht resulted in applause from
the audience. Judge Cashman said,
“One more outburst, and you will be
out. This is a court of law, not a circus.
Do you understand?”

While the witnesses were answer-
ing in the courtroom, protesters were
shouting “Justice for Jonny!” outside
the County Courthouse building.

One of the protesters, identified
only as “Leon,” wore a sign on the
front and back of his body that read,
“No Justice for Jonny Gammage in
Pittsburgh Kangaroo Court” and
“Jonny Gammage charge: Erratic dri-
ving. Penalty: Deprivement of last
breath.”

Turban Shabazz, another protestor,
said the defense and the prosecution
are “playing a game” and that there is
no justice in the case.

Shabazz said that black people and
other minorities should refuse to pur-
chase any items made or sold in
Pittsburgh.

ly, “It‘s not for
me to tell you
what your client
did. It’s for the
client to tell me,
the ladies and gentleman of the jury,
what he did, what he was doing there,
and why he was participating in this.”

In an objection, the defense asked
for a mistrial on the grounds that the
juries minds were tainted by this state-
ment.

There was a sidebar discussion
with the judge, and court was
adjourned until Friday morning.

Friday was a day of reckoning for
the prosecution as Judge Cashman
declared a mistrial in favor of the
defense because the gag order on
Coroner Wecht was broken.

It was impossible to tell the jury to
disregard Wecht’s last statement
because it was too powerful and violat-
ed the defendant’s constitutional rights
of the 5th Amendment. The amend-
ment exists to provide safeguards
against self—incrimination for defen-
dants.

The mistrial declaration stunned
onlookers. As the ruling came from the
judge, there were people gathered. out-
side, praying for justice.

Judge Cashman told the jurors not
to talk with the media, who were upset
with the ruling. The president of the
Pittsburgh NAACP announced that he
would ask the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania to choose a county where
blacks are better represented for the
new trial’s jury selection.

SGB

Another concern brought up at
the meeting was the emergence of
the drug Rohypnol onto Pitt’s cam—
pus. Rohypnol is a sedative similar
to Valium that causes complete loss
of memory for those that ingest it.

The drug has been used at an
alarming rate to assault women on
college campuses around the coun-
try. It is most often slipped into a
woman’s drink without her knowl-
edge, and the subsequent blackout
that results leaves her vulnerable to
rape and abuse.

CWO representative Christa
Douaihy and SGB member Lauren
Leiter made a plea to all of the stu-
dents in attendance to tell their
friends about the seriousness of the
presence of Rohypnol in the
Pittsburgh area.

“The issue for women should be
to get your own drink because you
don’t know what someone could
put in it,” said Leiter.

SGB members also passed a
resolution to delve more deeply
into the University Capital
Planning Committee’s proposal for
a budget increase. President Andy
Wuertele said that he felt the stu-
dents deserved to know if and when
the projected increase would affect
tuition.

give out unusual care-packages

‘Dawn Anderson

 

Freshman students were welcomed
to Pitt with life-saving care packages
instead of the usual temporary reme-
dies, like cough medicine and home-
made brownies, sent from home

BiGaLA and The Pittsburgh AIDS
Taskforce joined together on
Wednesday at the William Pitt Union to
provide information on topics such as
sexually transmitted diseases, homo-
sexual education and legal pamphlets,
HIV testing, and the distribution of risk
reduction kits.

As you walked past the information
table, you were compelled to stop when
you heard questions like, “What is a
dental dam?” and “Are these condoms
free?”

“We want to do our part to educate
the public and help in risk reduction,”
said Aleia Hall, a freshman nursing stu-
dent. “I am a Afro-American female
volunteering because BiGaLA is a good
group that is here for everyone who has
been discriminated against. I am not
gay, but this is beneficial for the entire
campus. You don’t have to be gay, but
just gay friendly.”

This workshop provided all stu-
dents with the opportunity to receive
free safe sex kits that included con-
doms, dental dams, lubricants, and
advice to how to reduce the risk of
acquiring STDs, including HIV.

The volunteers explained to the
group that HIV could be spread through

bodily ﬂuids such as blood, semen, or
vaginal secretions, and protection
should be used always be used in all
sexual encounters, including oral sex.
Condoms should be used on men and
dental dams with females.

A volunteer from the Pittsburgh
AIDS Taskforce was there to answer
questions and to inform students about
HIV and offer free, confidential, as well
as anonymous, testing with a special
contract with the Allegheny County
Health Department.

“We provide anonymous and confi-
dential HIV testing,” said Jay Poliziani
from the Pittsburgh AIDS Taskforce.
“The difference with anonymous test-
ing is that you never give your name,
and no one except you can tell your test
results, unlike confidential testing
which is where you give your name,
and the results can be released with
your consent.”

As of 1996, there were 21,456 peo-
ple diagnosed with AIDS and an esti-
mated 14,560 infected with HIV in
Allegheny County, according to the
Pittsburgh AIDS Taskforce.

To inquire about walk-in hours for
counseling and testing, call the
Pittsburgh AIDS Taskforce office at
242-2500 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.

“We are pleased with what is going
on here because the people that are
stopping by are giving the information
to their friends, and that is really impor-
tant,” said Christian Baker, leader of
BiGaLA.

BiGaLA i.

join,” Baker said. “BiGaLA is an organiza-
tion to get information, makefriends, and
take part in a smaller community. We don’t
have a counseling center, but we do refer
people. Most important, people must
remember to celebrate diversity; you don’t
have to be gay.”

One obstacle BiGaLA faces is that
many students are afraid of what others will
think of them if they join. If a student has-
n’t come to terms with his sexual prefer-
ence and would like to remain discreet,
BiGaLA will honor the member’s decision.

“We want our office to -not be a hiding
space, but an open place for all those inter-
ested,” Baker explains. “Some students
wony about their parents finding out and
cutting off their tuition, or their friends will
ridicule and treat them diiferently. If you
would like to be discreet, it’s OK because
we understand and have been there before.”

Members of the group would like it to

 

FROM PAGE I

become more visible on campus this year
by actively seeking new members to help
stimulate growth, becoming more political-
ly active, and volunteering for community
services. They also hope that spokespeople
from the group will become more accessi-
ble to speak about diversity to Pitt’s classes.

“We are looking for ways and people
to better our organization this year. For
example, we are participating in G.R.O.W.
[Grass Roots Organizing Weekend] which
is a student foundation that provides work-
shops on how to better an organization,”
commented Douglas. ‘

BiGaLA is located in the William Pitt
Union, and they can be reached at 648-
2105. They welcome your calls and visits.
They will be discreet in retuming calls, if
you specify.

“If you want to be discreet, it’s OK We
are here for you. Come see, hang out, and
judge for yourself,” said Baker.

Pedulla needs to be recognized

Isn’t a student placing seventh in Olympic compe-
tition representing Pitt through athletic attainment? That
is exactly what Marisa Pedulla did in the judo competi-
tion at the Olympic games in Atlanta. Pedulla, howev-
er, is not eligible for a rectangle on the Pitt Varsity
Athletics’ walkway between the Cathedral of Leaming
and Heinz Chapel.

Marisa Pedulla has represented not only Pitt, but
also the United States in intemational competition. It is
true that she doesn’t quite ﬁt the “varsity athletics” por-
tion of the walkway, but that is a rather minor problem
considering her achievements and the positive inﬂuence
she ‘has been as a part of the University community.

Perhaps it is time to revise the requirements for the
walk ‘ A

The “varsity” requirement to get a space on the
walkway should be lifted. An argument in favor of hav-
ing the requirement dropped in this case is that there is
no varsity judo here at Pitt. If a student excels at a sport
which is not offered as a varsity program here, is that
student’s achievement any less meaningful than if it
were in an offered sport? .

Should Marisa Pedulla’s achievements while she
was a student at Pitt go unrecognized? No. She has
accomplished too much in the ﬁeld of athletics for the
University not to reward her.. Pitt should be going out of

 
  

here's Marisa Pedu||a's spot on the walk?

its way to show pride in having a Pitt student compet-
ing in the Olympics. The least it can do is give her a
space on the walkway devoted to recognizing athletic
attainment by Pitt students. It is greatly deserved.

Hey, get the heck out of my space!,

 

Since I ﬁnd myself in a
morose state at the time of this
writing, I will do something rather
unusual. Instead of indulging in
useless self—pity and sad contem-
plation, I will try to be positive.
With this move, I will show, hope-
fully, that there are several signiﬁ-
cant positive sides to living in the
U.S.

The most obvious luxury that
the U.S. offers is space. It’s amaz-
ing how such a blatant aspect of
American life can oﬁ go unnoticed.
I don’t think the average American
notices how BIG everything is
here. 'Ihere’s plenty of breathing
room The streets are wide, the
houses are often free-standing with
spacious lawns, and there’s a huge
personal space surrounding every-
one.Takeamornenttonoticethat
even when the balls or elevators
are crammed with people, bump-
ing into someone still prompts a
quick “excuse  It’s entirely
possible not to touch someone for
prolonged amounts of time.
Greetings do not include any kind

- of physical contact Generally, peo-

ple don’t even shake hands when
meeting someone new, unless it’s a
fomial situation. You can end up
living in a sort of vacuum, but most
of you probably wouldn’t take
note. It’s normal. People get ner-
vous if someone stands too close or
touches their arm while talking to
them. So is this a reﬂection of
superﬁciality? A physical manifes-
tation of unwillingness to be
touched by another’s emotional
state? Or is it respect of privacy?
Since I started out on the
assumption I was going to be posi-
tive, let’s say it’s a respect of priva-
cy.,So, can that be backed up in

- other ways?.Well, there is the ques-

tion of changing rooms. I mean the

dressing rooms in clothing stores in
the U.S. are individual and include
a mirror in every booth. In
Holland, the dressing booths are
also individual, but they are often
in the middle ofthe store, not like
here where they are hidden some-
where towards the back T'hat’s not
a problem, but what can be annoy-
ingistheusuallackofmimorsin

you ever going to wear it? So you
say people shouldn’t be so uptight
about their clothes or what they
look like? Well,

    

  

in which to change, or with several
sections. In Holland, it’s usually
one open space, and the shower is
a communal type shower. So, in
the U.S. version, there’s more
respect and chance for privacy
when changing and showering. Or
is that prudishness again?

Maybe it would be a good
ideato go backto my original point
at this time and discuss this space
issue. Houses, streets, lawns, build-
ings, and people are bigger here.
The size of the average suburban
house here is immense compared
to the average in Holland Streets
are extremely wide in comparison
to Holland, as_wel1. The sprawling
lawns are a tremendous luxiny

 when seen from

  

it was merely an a Dutch view-
exarnple to illus— point (or a
trate the tr e m e n d o u s
American ten- maintenance nui-
dency to privacy sance). So here’s
 orisit prudish- the irony: the
ness? U.S. has tons of

Well, here’s space, yet it is a
another exam- norm for all ﬁrst-
ple: in Holland, .. . . .   .. . year university
gradesforcoursesarepostedatthe students to share aroom with a

departments of the university
under the names of the students.
There is no ﬁddling with numbers
or other codes, it’s very straightfor-
ward. Here, as we all know, grades
are rarely posted, and if they are,
they’re under Social Security num-
bers. It must be said, though, that
the Dutch students do not look at
the other grades unless checking
for a friend. So, the American
method could be a betrayal of its
ridiculous competitiveness.

All right, I’ll try another exarn—
ple then. At sports clubs here, the
attitude in the locker rooms isquite
different than the one in Holland.
(Naturally I’m speaking of the
women’s room.) Here, there are
separate showers with shower cur-
tains, and there’s quite a large area

stranger. Dutch students do not
have roommates. To them, it’s
unfathomable that one could share
a mom with a totally unknown per-
son for at least a year. To see the
amount of space available in the
U.S., it is indeed quite strange that
in this country, one is completely
expected to share a small room
with someone for at least a year. I
would wonder if it’s perhaps the
only way for‘Americans to leam to
live in close contact with someone
else. Is this another area in which
the educational system is attempt-
ing to pick up where the so-called
disintegrated American family has
left oﬁ?

Machteld de Waard has decided to
give up for now on this “positive”
attempt.

Wally ranks as
P$U's worst

 

Just thought I ’d let you know...

- After Penn State quarterback Wally
Richardson completed a pathetic 10 of 30
passes for a measly 106 yards and fumbled
twice in a 21-20 loss to Iowa, can there be
any doubt that Richardson is the worst Penn
State signal caller since Joe Pa started as
head coach?

In fact, this person has deduced that if

Matt Lytle, Pete Gonzalez, or Tony
Zimmerman started at PSU, they would def-
initely outplay Richardson, who’s had an
incredibly dismal 1996 campaign.
0 Was it just me or did the Pittsburgh
Penguins actually resemble at least a
mediocre hockey club during a 2-1 win over
the crappy Washington Capitals? The win
was only the second of the year for the Pens.
- All this talk about the Ohio State Buckeyes
being the best team in the country is
garbage. The best team is unquestionably
the Florida Gators, followed closely by the
Nebraska Comhuskers.

The Gators manhandled the Auburn

Tigers 51-10 on national television. It’s
kinda funny considering that Auburn spent
most of the week talking trash. Speaking of
another team that talks trash...
- It’s a sad day when Fox Sports Channel,
soon to take over KBL, says Penn State is a
local team and doesn’t include any Pitt pro-
motions in the commercial.

Sure, Penn State may win more football
games, but isn’t Oakland a helluva lot clos-
er to the TV studios than Crappy Valley?

I dunno, but I do know that if Crappy
Valley was so goddamn special then Penn
State’s highest inﬂux of graduates wouldn’t
live in Pittsburgh. Strange, but I guess after
a Penn State alum has his agriculture/beast-
iality degree, he can come to Pittsburgh to
work at the local Cogo’s selling beef jerky
and corn nuts to stoned Pitt students. Furmy
how things work out in the long run.

the rewards.

Distance runners dominate
the Duquesne Invitational

Mike Kovak

 

Duquesne University officially host-
ed the Duquesne University Invitational,
but the University of Pittsburgh cross
country team dominated both the men’s
and women’s sides of the meet.

The meet was held under poor condi-
tions: Saturday’s cold and rainy weather
did not generally make times better.
However Head Coach Dave Sobal didn’t
feel that the weather affected his team
signiﬁcantly.

“When you’re really working hard, it

feels like it’s 20 degrees warmer,” Sobal

said. “I was delighted with the times —
the women in particular.”

The Pitt men, who ran a 5-rnile »

course in Schenley Park, outdistanced
the 6—team ﬁeld, ﬁnishing first with 32
points. Marshall University placed sec-
ond with 42 points, and host Duquesne
ﬁnished third with 64 points. Like golf,
cross country teams with the least amount
of points do the best.

The men placed ﬁve runners in the
top 10. Ed Adamson, Pitt’s best runner
this season, easily outran the ﬁeld. His
ﬁrst—place time of 26:12 beat the second
place ﬁnisher, Brian DeRose of Marshall,

Pedulla continues to blend academcis & athletics

Katie.;Cook

   

Does choking someone into uncon-
sciousness help students do better in
school?

Marisa Pedulla thinks so and is
uniquely qualiﬁed to say so. A graduate

student and former Chancellor’s
Scholar at Pitt, Pedulla also placed sev-
enth in the women’s judo competition
at the Olympic Games in Atlanta. Last
Friday, in a talk at the University
Honors College, she spoke about the
connections between athletic and acad-
emic attainment.

What do athletics have to do with
academics?

“Both require a comrriitment to
excellence and a continual desire to
improve,” Pedulla said.

This commitment of which Pedulla
spoke has allowed her to be successful
at her chosen pursuits. The focus on
individual achievement and pride in
accomplishment are common to both
athletics and academics. Yet there is
more to it than the actual accomplish-
ment. The actual process also counts for
something, according to Pedulla.

“Failure leads to growth and devel-

opment in good students and athletes,”
she said.

“Nothing comes easily. Everybody
fails. Just try to adapt or alter the
approach when there’s failure. As long
as you have tried and given it your best,

. the development you have gotten out of

it is most important, and the outcome is
actually irrelevant.”

She said, “I have seen people in
judo with more talent than me, but they
didn’t get as far because they were not

as motivated. Anybody can train hard

and attain on the days when they feel
good, but on the days when you don’t
feel so good and you feel down, that’s
when you’ve got to push a little harder.”

Pedulla recalled when she had to
lose eight pounds to drop down into the
next lower weight category.

“Almost every day, I had to get up
to go running, and I just hated to run,”
she said. “But I kept it up, lost eight
pounds, and now my next goal is to run
in a marathon. You’ve got to believe in
yourself.”

Pedulla added, “Self-esteem does-
n’t come from people telling how well
you did; self-esteem comes from doing
something.”

Pedulla said realizing when one

path is not leading in the right direction
is crucial. Motivation is key, she said,
but bull-headedness cannot accomplish
much.

“If there’s this wall here, and even
if I believe I can get through it, I won’t.
I have to go through the door.”

Her own training schedule reﬂects
this. She always takes at least one day a
week off from all training in order to
giver herself a chance to regroup men-
tally and physically.

Pedulla has had to overcome adver-
sity to get where she is in her sport. Her
first experience with judo was when her
brother threw her and knocked the wind
out of her. But within a few weeks, she
was out there competing.

“Judo translated means ‘way of
gentleness,’ and here are some of the
ways in which I have been gentle,”
Pedulla said. “I have broken my ﬁnger,
my foot, my collar bone, separated my
right shoulder, my left shoulder, dislo-
cated fingers, and suffered a concus-
sion.”

Yet she says it was all worth it
because, “One of the most aesthetically
beautiful things you can see is when a
throw is executed perfectly. You are in

- It’s nice to see that despite all Pitt’s football
woes the team hasn’t lost faith.

Since Johnny Majors started inserting

younger talent into the lineup (Demond
Gibson, Seth Homack, Brian Minehart,
Hank Poteat, etc.), Pitt has added a little dash
to its ﬂava, and the older players aren’t com-
plaining. In fact, they’re trying to help out.
- It’s a sad day when the Duquesne Dukes

scholarships, receives front page coverage in

Big East boasts ﬁve nationally ranked
women’s cross country teams. Defending
national champion Providence sits once
again atop the country; Georgetown is
fourth, Boston College seventh, Villanova
eighth, and Notre Dame is 22nd.

“Sometimes I feel the women come
out of the Big East meet with an inferior-
ity complex,” Sobal said. “They can run
their heads off and still ﬁnish sixth, but
that’s right behind all those nationally
ranked teams.”

The men’s side of the Big East cross
country slate shows the Friars ranked
eighth, 'Notre Dame ninth, and
Georgetown not far behind at 11th.

Track and ﬁeld Coach Steve Lewis
will decide this week which long distance
Panthers will make the trek to Boston.

“Based on the performances this
weekend, I feel we’re ready to run,”
Sobal said.

Peduﬂa

harmony even with the people you are
competing with.”

Another correlation between athletic
and academic success is the cama-
raderie.

_ “Both athletics and academics have
communities where you can meet and
associate with people who share your
interests,” Pedulla said.

She also said that meeting the differ-
ent people from all walks of life and all
parts of the world through judo have
shown her that “People are different, but
people are the same.”

Pedulla said that there are differ-
ences between people who just want to
be successful and those who actually
are.

“The question is what are you will-
ing to do [to achieve your goal]. A lot of
people had said to me ‘you must have
sacriﬁced a lot,’ but I tell them that I did-
n’t sacriﬁce anything. I just did what I
wanted to do.”

This applies whether you spend
hours studying for a test or six days a
week practicing judo, she said. Along
with that ingredient is the need for focus.
An athlete and a scholar both must have
their minds on what they are doing.

“I never took seven hours to do a
one-hour workout,” Pedulla said.

These aspects of success were evi-
dent in her fellow Olympians.

“The people in the Olympics really
have their lives together. There were
lawyers who were fencers and a softball
player who was a surgeon.”

 

In regards to the Olympics. Pedulla
said that the competition was the most
exciting part.

Although success is important,
Pedulla said that one of theilessons she
learned from judo is that it is important
to give something back to the sport.

“Everything you do needs to be put
in context,” Pedulla said. “What kid did
I encourage to keep going or to try
something new?

“The theory behind judo is that
through the training of the mind and
body helps you help others.” Judo is all
about showing respect, actually helping
each other through this.”

Pedulla is focusing now on complet-
ing her degree and helping the younger
judo players improve. She said that she
is constantly seeking opportunities to
speak to school kids and groups like the
Girl Scouts and the Brownies.

“It seems to be a self-fulﬁlling
prophecy that only the number one and
two—ranked judo participants can enter
the national competition and I would
like to effect change with the organiza-
tion [United States Judo Inc.) and help
kids to be good competitors.”

Pedulla said that she could not have
accomplished what she had without the
support and help of many people in her
life, including her coach and her hus-
band. _

Pedulla will compete in the U.S.
Open Judo Championships in Colorado
Springs next Saturday. Look for the
results in The Pitt News’ Sports section.
