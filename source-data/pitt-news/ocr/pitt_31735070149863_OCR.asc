Pitt schools eonsiderjeining the Collegiate Readership Program  

By Michael Ringling
Staff Writer

If other Pitt schools agree, un-
dergraduate non—College of Gen-
eral Studies students might see a
cheaper price tag for the Colle-
giate Readership Program.

The $33,600 program, which
provides paper and online access

to The New York Times and USA

. Today, will return to campus 0

March 13. i
But Student Government
Board President James Lan-
dreneau said that he wants to ﬁnd
alternative funding for the pro-
gram and has sent a proposal to
the student governments of the
College of General Studies and
Pitt’s graduate and professional

schools.-

The proposal would have the
CGS Student Government and
the Graduate and Professional
Student Assembly pay $1,200
and $8,000 a year, respectively,
for the Collegiate Readership
Program. Currently, the program
is paid for entirely by the Student
Activities Fund, which is amassed
from the $80 Student Activities

Fee that non-CGS undergraduate
students pay each semester.

“We might need to go back
and forth before we settle on a
number,” Landreneau said, re-
ferring to the portion of the total
cost each school would pay. “The
initial push is out there.”

Both CGS Student Govern-
ment President Pat. Szczepan—
ski and GPSA President Nyasha

Hungwe responded positivelyto
the prospects of joining in on the
Collegiate Readership Program
but upheld cost as the main re-
maining issue.

“Anything that gives some-
thing more to our students 'is a
positive thing,” Szczepanski said.

The Vagina Monologues to debut today at Alumni Hall

Byjosh Won
Staff Writer

During the Bosnian war, an es-
timated 50,000 women were
raped — that’s about triple of
Pitt’s undergraduate popula-
tion. ’

But one undergraduate,
senior Gabby Grosso, will tell
those women’s tragedies dur-
ing this year’s Vagina Mono-
logues. Her monologue, “My
Vagina Was My Village,” is

based on Bosnian women in refu— _

gee camps.
Despite the somber topic, she

said she has enjoyed preparing -

for the event. “It’s very laid back
—— we have fun,” Grosso said dur-
ing Wednesday’s night dress re-
hearsal.

Grosso is one of 16 students
starring in this weekend’s produc-
tion of the Vagina Monologues, a
show put on by the Campus Wom-
en’s Organization each year around
Valentine’s Day. The Vagina Mono-
logues is an international show
written by playwright, performer
and activist Eve Ensler. The show

consists of a series of monologues ,

based on interviews with hundreds

of women of various backgrounds, . ‘

ages, races and sexual orientations.
And the content revolves around
one thing: the vagina. T

The Vagina Monologues are
part of V-Day, an activist movement
striving to stop violence against
women around the world.

ans co-directed Pitt’s production,
which debuts tonight at 7:30 p.m.
in Alumni Hall.

“The V-Day organization’s pur-
pose is ﬁghting sexual and domes-
tic violence worldwide. There’s
an empowering element [to the
show] ,” salamone said.

Going in stride  V—Day’s'

purpose, 10 percent of the funds

from Vagina Monologues per-.

nated to supporting, the women
of Haiti. - _ V

“Ninety percent of women in
refugee camps in  have lives
touched by sexual violence,” Sala-
mone said. -;l.“f‘l

Pitt’s CWO will donate the other
90 percent of its ticket sale earn-
ings to Planned Parenthood.

Salamone said that auditions
for the show began in the ﬁrst week
of December, and the women cho-
sen have been practicing once a
week sincejan. 6. ,_

In previous years, graduate

students and women around the
Pittsburgh community have also
participated, but this year, Salam-

one said Pitt studentsjare playing

most of the roles.
“This year, it’s pretty in-house,”
Salamone said, “but [the Mono-

blogués] are about the Pittsburgh

community, not just about Pitts-
burgh the school.”

The monologues cover topics
ranging from Grosso’s depiction of

bers issue.” - V

Landreneau said he based the values
for the proposal on a formula he and SGB
Allocations Chair Michael Nites devised.
The formula takes into account the num-
ber of students at each school ~— 1,151 in
CGS, 10,339 governed by the GPSA and
18,427 undergraduate non—CGS — and the
number of drop boxes located near each
school. A total of seven drop boxes will be
positioned throughout campus.

“We used the formula as a base, but we
adjusted the numbers to be realistic,” Ni-
tes said.

He said that the initial formula calcu-
lated GPSA’s'charge to be around $12,000,
but that number was lowered to increase
the probability that the school would sign
on to the program. .

Prior to the Collegiate Readership Pro-
gram’s public reinstatement at an SGB
meeting onjan. 31, the Board decided over

STICKING MY NECK OUT

Managing” love with mental illness

By Tracey Hickey
Columnist

 

A Postsecret post from 2011 said, “When you have a
relationship with someone who is mentallyill, you
have a relationship with mental illness, not a person.”
A cruder but more popular adage goes, “Don’t stick
your dick in crazy.”

Considering those attitudes, it shouldn’t be sur-
prising that although dating a person with mental
illness can indeed be frustrating, actually be-
inglthe “crazy.” person‘ in‘ your relationship
is no picnic either. Despite the fact that in
any given year, one in four Americans
suffers from a mental illness — mak— *' 
ing it statistically likely that anyone '
who has more than four romantic
entanglements will date somebody
with mental illness e people who

!’

tions are often assumed to
be needy, irrational, self-
absorbed, unreliable, de-
manding and generally unﬁt
for relationships. People who

ten made to feel that they are ~ t "
unlovable, that they aren’t “worth
the trouble” of coping with their
symptoms and that only a saint
would be willing to be with them.
Despite its popularity, this as-,
sumption doesn’t make sense. People,
whether they’re mentally healthy or not,
are weird and difﬁcult and frustrating, and
all relationships take a hell of a lot ’of_work.

panic attacks or rapid cycles is challeng-
ing —— but so is dating someone who’s
ﬂat broke and can rarely afford to go
out on dates, someone who lives
several hours away from you,
someone who eats meatiwhen
you’re a vegan, whose family you‘
don’t get along with or who is hor-
ribly allergic to your beloved pet.
People 30 years ofder than us usually
have to factor in a prospective partner’s
children. So it’s ridiculous to imagine that something
like a mood disorder is an insurmountable obstacle
to romantic fulﬁllment for either partner. '
Becoming convinced that you’re unlovable or
impossible to deal with is a nearly sureﬁre way to
get stuck in a relationship with someone who doesn’t
treat you right. Beware the partner who uses your
mental illness to dismiss any concerns you might
have in the relationship, insisting that you only feel
like he is taking advantage of you or that she isn’t
making enough time for you in her life because you’re
crazy. Maybe you are crazy, but that doesn’t mean
you deserve to be treated badly or that you can’t
recognize when it’s happening. '
Jokes aside, if you’re struggling with -mental ill-

ness and your partner calls you crazy, that’s really
not a good sign.

Moreover, if your partner is worth being with, you
do themuno favors by adopting an I-am-not-worthy
attitude. Apologizing for inconveniences is natural
and commendable, but if you don’t work on cultivat-
ing the impression that you’re lovable despite your
challenges, you’re susceptible to what my boyfriend
calls the “meta-freakout,” e.g., “You had a panic
attack and that was a bummer, but it was more of a

bummer when you spent 45 minutes apologizing for ,

the panic attack and crying over how much
, easier my life would be without you.” It’s
not easy, but the best thing you can do
for yourself and your partner is ditch
. the idea that living with mental ill-
ness is something you did wrong.
It’s ﬁne to apologize — once — if your
depression interferes with plans to go
out, but don’t apologize for living with
depression. ~ _
For many people, deciding when
and how to tell someone you’re dating
about your mental lll1‘L€_SS is almost
as difficult as confronting the chal-
‘ lenges that arise later.

I told my last two boy-
friends on the ﬁrst date that I
took antidepressants — but

if disclosure was a problem for
me, I wouldn’t write this column,
so I know my comfort level is far from
average. Despite that, I still recommend that
,— most people disclose their struggles as early
as possible. At the very least, discuss any
issues likely to arise well before they actu-
ally eome up. For example, if there will be
complications with sex — if you have an
eating disorder or body image prob-
' ’ . A. e lem that will make taking your clothes
V off traumatic, if you’ve been a vic-
tim of sexual abuse in the past or
' if you’re on psychiatric medication
A with sexual side effects — it’s best
to mention it before things get hot
and heavy. If you have social anxiety,
let your partner know before he expects you
to meet his friends. .
_ When you get serious with someone,
you’ll want to let him or her know how your illness

manifests itself in your life, and what that person can V

expect when it does. Explaining what a depressive
episode looks like for you —— before -your partner
witnesses one —.will make the event less stressful
for both of you when the next one hits. Although the
subject is stressful, stay as matter-of-fact as possible
and keep the focus on practical concerns, like how
your mental health issues will affect your relation-
ship and how best to handle them together. Any
decent person will be able to recognize that you’re
not “a mental illness,” but a person_with challenges
like any other. 3

R Julie Allerton
For The Pitt News

Finally, a love story that we can believe
in. A ~
Because this time it’s true’ — well, at
least mostly. “The Vow,” a story about a
wife with amnesia and her faithful husband
who helps her remember their marriage.

The entertaining and idealistic‘ chick
ﬂick is based on the real life stories of Kim
and Krickitt Carpenter. In 1993, -shortly
after marrying, the couple got into a car
accident that caused Krickitt forgot the
previous 18 months of he-r life, including‘
Kim. Together they worked through it and
wrote the book that the movie is based on.

In the movie, Paige and Leo (McAdams
and Tatum, respectively), ﬁnd themselves
in a similar situation. And just as Krickitt
did, Paige works to remain with Leo based
on the “vow” she made to him. .

Sound familiar? Indeed, Rachel McAd-
ams starred in the strikingly similar movie,
“The Notebook,” in 2004. But“‘The- Vow”
has a realness and humor to assure that it
isn’t quite the same kindof overwrought
love story.

In a beginning that seems to promise
every rom—com cliche, the ﬁlm opens with
highlights of Paige and Leo’s romance. The"
sickeningly sweet hand—holding and long
gazes are cut short with the ﬁlm’s “moment‘
of impact.” And suddenly, it gets very real.

After a slow—motion crash scene, Paige
wakes up from a coma to ﬁnd that she can-

. not.recall the past ﬁve years, much less her_

and Leo’s 18-month relationship.

She shoves the conﬂict in our faces when
she answers her husband’s question, “You
know who I am right?” with a convinced,
“Yeah, you’re my doctor.” From here, the

amnesia keeps her ‘Vow’ in movie

“The Vow”

Starring: Rachel McAdams
and Channing Tatum
Directed'by Michael Sucsy

Grade: B

ﬁlm. begins to resist the melodramatic
speeches of most romance and heads in a
more believable direction.

Paige’s unchecked frankness is recur-
ring, and McAdams’ delivery is often pretty

funny — an aspect of “The Vow” that saves _

us from the worn—out love confessions of
this genre. Whenlconfronted with the de-
cision of living with her stranger—husband
or the familiar parents who hadpbeen es-
tranged during the blank years of her life,

"she states, “I married him. It must have

been for some reason.”

The ﬁlm’s plot is complex but painfully
predictable. Despite the addition of hin—-
dering parents and the re—emergence of
Paige’s ex-ﬁancé, the twists "and turns all
resolve in an obvious way.

Though the trailers built up the love
story, they didn’t reveal all the family is-
sues and conﬂicts that keep the ﬁlm rooted
ﬁrmly in something real. Whether or not
Kim and Krickitt faced the same chal-
lenges, the ﬁlm does a decent job avoiding
overlooking the other complications that
might arise from such a trauma. '

By the ﬁlm’s end, despite a predictable
ﬁnish — the couple did write a book to-
gether after all — the audience shouldn’t
be surprised to leave the theater with tear-
ﬁlled eyes.

They will be wearing neon and a ban-

along to every hook, are able to say, “His
set was totally better when I saw him over
the summer,” and spend their free time

The Single Woman

“This is what’s cool right now, right
guys?” Inevitably, there will be a group
of mid-to-1ate—twenty—something single
women at this show.

She graduated several years ago, but
due to a recent breakup, she yearns for-her
college years again. She heard. about this
through her old sorority Facebook group
and assumed that the dress code would in-
clude a tight black dress and heels.

She had one too many shots with her"
girls before the show and fully intends on

being entirely inappropriate with an un~ '

suspecting college male. No, don’t give in
to her appeal as an “older woman.” You’ll
probably end up holding her hair next to
a toilet later in the night. Old habits dies,
hard.

Your ﬁrst dubstep show can be a scary
time. The music is loud, the lights are er-
ratic and the guy next to you is asking if
you know where his friend Molly went.

You will encounter many interesting,”
wayward souls at this show, but despite’
your differing quirks you are all united by
your love for crazy dancing and general
disregard for social mores.

Take this guide to heart and next time
you’ll know which group to womp with.[

 aAsKEdiithers takeon. Mountaineers in
 final edition of Big East Backyard Brawl

By Sean Corrado
Staff Writer

After a court settlement announc-
ing that West Virginia will join
the Big 12 in July, Pitt and West
Virginia’s men’s basketball teams
,_ will ﬁght for the ﬁnal time as Big

East conference rivals in a regu- ‘

lar-season Backyard Brawl.

The rivalry’s latest battle will
take place Thursday night in the
Petersen Events Center, where
Pitt is 7-1 all-time against West
Virginia.

However, the Panthers are
once again on a losing streak af-
ter dropping back-to—back games
against South Florida and Seton
Hall. Pitt is looking to regain the

SPORTS  

momentum needed for another
hot run. - .

“It is just execution,” Nasir
Robinson said on what is neces-
sary to ﬁnd success. “Just the little
things that we were doing on our
winning streak, we gotta get back
to those things.”

Robinson is looking forward
to playing the Mountaineers at
home in a loud environment.'In
a physical game with WVU, any
advantage helps. On Jan. 30, the
Panthers claimed victory over the
Mountaineers 72-66 in Morgan-
town.

“It’s another big game,” head
coachjamie Dixon said. “Just like
the rest of our games.” Dixon is
12-6 all—time against WVU.

West Virginia is also on a

two-game losing streak after
getting edged out by Louisville
and N otre Dame. The Mountain-
eers have now fallen to 6-7 in the
conference and will need a vic-

" toryin Pittsburgh to climb back

to .500. -
Forward Kevinjones will con-
tinue to lead his Mountaineers
as he has all season. The Big East
leader in points per game (20.2)
and rebounds per game (11.2) ap-
pears to be a leading candidate

for Big East Player of the Year.-

Robinson describes Jones’ play as
tough, active and strong.

V “We need to force him to take
tough shots,” Robinson said of
Jones, who scored 21 points and

grabbed 13 boards in the last

meeting against Pitt.

The bigger bodied lineup that
West Virginia presents may re-
sult in Dixon using more big men
like Dante Taylor and Talib Zanna

a throughout the game. Pitt was

prepared to play this defense in
the last meeting, but it'was not
needed after the offense took
control.

Travon Woodall will once again
be the key to Pittsburgh’s game.
Woodall scored a game-high 24

' points in the last meeting. Dixon

believes the Mountaineers will
try new defensive strategies to
block Woodall’s recent run of cre-
ating opportunities for the Pitt
offense. ‘ -

_].J. Moore commented that
the game is a must-win to rebuild
Pitt’s conﬁdence. Now at 4-9_ in
the conference, Pitt has a chance
to closeout the regular season
strong and earn a higher Big East

. tournament seed. ‘

“We’ve gotta win a lot of
games, no question about it,”
Dixon said. ‘

Thursday night’s game will
have a lot of impact on the present
standings, but raises questions
about what is‘ in store for the fu-
ture of the Backyard Brawl.

“It’s a good rivalry,f’ Moore .

said. “Hopefully we can get them
back.” I

Thursday’s game will be the

 

I meeting between Pitt and West Virginia

on the hardwood sirice 1903.

Panthers back on the diamond

after record-breaking 2011 season 

By R] Sepich
Staff Writer

Last spring, the Pitt softball team enjoyed
the best season in the program’s short 14-
year history. ~

The Panthers shattered single-season
school records in numerous categories
including overall wins (34), Big East wins
(13), shutouts (14) and home runs (51).

With the start of another season on the
horizon this weekend, Pitt is ready and
excited to face the challengeof topping its
2011 accomplishments.

A “Last season was the best year Pitt’s
ever had for softball, and to know that we
all contributed-was really cool, but I think
we can be even better this season,”. junior
catcher Holly Stevens said.

Fourth—year Pitt head coach Holly
Aprile, who has led the Panthers to three

' straight winningseasons in her time at the

helm, believes that Pitt can ﬁnish at the top
of the conference this season.

“We’re focused on winning the Big
East,” she said. “There’s the regular season
and the tournament championship — we
look at both of those. We’ve established
ourselves in the conference and now we
have to be able to show up and beats the

' better teams in the conference on a more

consistent basis.”

Having lost ﬁve seniors — including
starting pitchers Cory Berliner and Alyssa
O’Connell and star outﬁelder Reba Tutt —
Pitt’s biggest obstacle of this campaign will
come in replacing its graduated starters.

The freshman class, however, has the
potential to do just that.

Among the eight new faces on the
Panthers’ roster, Coach Aprile thinks the
two ﬁrst—year pitchers could be vital to the
future of Pitt softball.

“We have three on the pitching staff, but
the top two are going to be a really strong
tandem — Savannah King and Alexa Larkin
— and Ido think they can take our program

 

 

to the next level,” Aprile said. “They’re
both freshmen, so experience does play a
part. But I think if they can play with poise,
they’re both ready to make an immediate
impact.”

Senior inﬁelder Niki Cognigni said that
the older players have a lot of conﬁdence
that this freshman class can ﬁll in right
away.

“This year is going to be a really exciting
year for us,” she said. “Some girls have big
shoes to ﬁll, which we know they are very

‘capable of doing.”

While the 2012 season will be the ﬁrst
in a Pitt uniform for the eight members of
the freshman class, it will also be the ﬁnal
year of play for the eight players in the
Panthers’ senior class.

This seasQn’s seniors joined the
program in the same year Coach Aprile was
promoted to head coach of Pitt softball,
and she said she would love to see this
group leave as the only senior class in the
program’s history to record four straight
winning seasons. ,

“This senior class was instrumental in
forming the foundation for where we want

- this program to go,” Aprile said. “They’ve

been a really positive inﬂuence on the
younger players in terms of doing things
we need to do on a daily basis in order to
be winners.” '
Comprised almost entirely of seniors
and freshmen, the new-look Panthers
will begin their season in the South this
weekend -by competing in the Texas
Invitational. Pitt will face Illinois and

Texas on Friday before meeting Tennessee

on Saturday. ,

Stevens said that facing top competition
in early—season tournaments like the Texas
Invitational will help mentally strengthen

the Panthers for when Big East play starts ‘

in late March.
“These games are really tough,” she
said. “We need to stay strong and always
remember that we’re a good team. I think
we’ll be good for the Big East.” i
