Paul Nyden

Files Suit,

Asks for Jury Trial

By DEANNA LOUISE

Former assistant sociology
professor Paul J . Nyden ﬁled suit
against the University yesterday,
charging Pitt with breach of
contract and violation of constitu-
tional rights, including due process
and the First and Fourteenth
Amendments.

The action marks the beginning
of Nyden’s external appeals of the
non-renewal of his sociology
department contract, terminated

PAUL NYDEN
Back to Court

April 30, 1977.

Named as defendants’ in the suit
were Chancellor Wesley Posvar,
Provost Rhoten Smith, faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg and sociology depart-
ment chairman Burkhart Holzner.
All four men were instrumental in
the decision to end the’ Marxist
professor’s Pitt career.

.-

Nyden’s attorney James H.
Logan, said the breach of contract
claims dispute the Chancellor’s
rejection of Nyden’s acceptance of a
15-month contract offer. The offer
would have extended Nyden’s Pitt
employment until August 31, 1978.
At that time of Nyden’s acceptance,
University lawyers concluded his
seven-page listing of his dis-
agreements with the Chancellor’s
proposal. did not constitute a legal
acceptance of the contract offer.

In a second breach of contract
dispute, Nyden’s lawyers allege he
“had an actual and reasonable
expectation of continued employ-
ment...until at least April 30,
1980,’ ’ the date of his consideration
for tenure. _

The constitutional claims of the
suit concern Nyden’s conviction his

contract was terminated because of '

his Marxist political learnings, and
his advocation of labor movements
and Black rights. University
spokesmen have repeatedly coun-
tered this contention, claiming
Nyden’ s removal from the sociology
department was based solely on a
review of his scholarly work and
teaching. .

If a jury trial is granted by a U.S.
District‘ Court judge, still unap-
pointed, court proceedings. could
continue for several years, as they
have in the Sharon Johnson sex
discrimination case, Nyden’s wife
Linda said.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Nyden said her
husband plans another appeal if he
is denied unemployment compen-
sation, as unofﬁcial reports claim
prove. Black studies professor

Pitt Considers Bidding
On Ministries Building

‘ By BETSY NORMAN

The University and City
Ministries, located at South Belle-
ﬁeld and Fifth Avenues, is up for
sale and Pitt is a prospective buyer,
according to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette. .

Rev. Eugene Kelly, director of
church strategy and extension for
the Pittsburgh Presbytery, owner of
the building, told the Post-Gazette
the sale is in the talking stage, but
he later declined comment on the
matter.

' Braden Suit Can Go to Court

"7

By BESTY NORMAN

Pitt may soon be faced with
another court battle dealing with
sex discrimination. The U.S. Court
of Appeals recently ruled that the
Ina Braden suit again Pitt -can be
argued before a Pittsburgh federal
court. I ’

Braden, formerly employed as an
assistant professor in the School of
Dental Medicine, ﬁlled a 1971
class-action suit against Pitt under
the federal Civil Rights act of 1871
(the 14th Amendment). The suit
also is ﬁled under Presidential
executive orders prohibiting sex
discrimination by government con-
tractors and subcontractors and the
Pennsylvania Equal Pay Act of
1959. Braden accused Pitt of
discriminatory acts against her and
other professional women employ-
ed at Pitt since January 1, 1968.

In order for the suit to be hear
before the courts, it had to be
proved the alleged discrimination
took place under “color of state
law” or there was “state action,”
because the 14th Amendment
applies only to states or agents of
states.

The Court of Appeals in a 56-page
opinion, upheld Braden’s conten-
tion the University is state-related,
“with such a close and continuing
relationship with the Common-
wealth that it cannot be con-
cluded...that state action is lack-
ing.”

This decision was in response to
Pitt’s appeal of Federal District
Judge Herbert Sorg’s 1975 ruling
that his court has jurisdiction in the
Braden case because the University
is, in effect, an arm of the state.

Braden’s suit was first filed before .

Sorg in 1971.

Pitt has decided to proceed with
the case instead of appealing this
latest decision.

Pitt’s Director of Legal Services
William Hannan was out of town
last night and unavailable for
comment. Other University attor-
neys declined comment.

Before arguments can begin,
Sorg must make a determination as
to which individuals Braden is
representing in her class action
suit—the number and occupations

of women involved and the dates I

spanning her complaint.

Braden’s suit specifically charges

Pitt with:

— ‘ ‘hiring women at lower rank and

at lower pay than comparably
trained and qualiﬁed men;

istry professor in Pitt’s med school

Mary Ann Aug, Pitt’s associate
director of news at Pitt said the
University is considering the
purchase of“the property.

Jack Freeman, vice chancellor of
planning and budget, said, “Pitt
always has an interest in property
bordering the campus. There has
been some talk concerning a large
number of properties, but to my
knowledge, there have not been

Flood Closes
UPJ Campus’
For Summer

By PETER J . BUTCH

Pitt-Johnstown, relatively un-
damaged in last week’s Cambria
County ﬂood that killed at least 61
people and left thousands home-
less, has taken a leading role in
disaster recovery efforts.

The Pennsylvania National
Guard and the American Red Cross
have been operating from bases
established at the regional campus,

I i which has also housed and fed the

guardsmen, volunteers and elderly‘
refugees. Summer classes have
been suspended due to the
tragedy. ~

According to, Robert Nossen,

Pitt’s associate provost for regional 1_

campuses Pitt immediately gave
the 350 National Guardsmen access
to the campus and provided
dormitory accommodations for 400
displaced elderly persons, many
requiring special diets and extra
care. _

“The response of the entire
University community has been
overwhelming,” Nossen said.
“We’re really grateful for every-
one’s help.” /

Pitt has sent a staff doctor,
nurses and campus policemen to
help expedite relief operations,
Nossen explained.

“The Johnstown staff has
worked 20 or more hours a day,"
Nossen said. “I can’t say enough
about how much people have been
willing to work.” I

“A University should take a‘

postion of leadership in a disaster
like this,” he continued. “We have
done everything a university can be
expected to do, from providing
resources to leadership.”
Although damage to the campus
was minimal, many faculty and
staff suffered grave financial

setbacks. “Nothing is certain
yet,” Nossen said, “but the

Pitt—Johnstown Becomes Flood Relief Center

(Continued from Page 1)

University should play some role
in helping its people.”

Clean-up operations could delay

Pitt Johnstown’s first day of’

classes.. “It depends on how soon
the city can resume operation and
relieve Pitt Johnstown of people
housed there,’-’ Nossen explained.

“We can’t turn these people out,
but we 'can’t bring students in
while they are here. We still plan
to operate this year, though.”

Nossen expressed concern over
the flood’s possible effect on
enrollment but said it would be
some time before it would be
noticed.

Pitt’s aid also came in the form of
technological know-how. According
to Mary Ann Aug, Pitt’s director of
news and publications, campus
police Emergency Medical Techni-
cians (EMT’s) contributed mobile
emergency communciations system
that was instrumental in establish-
ing a reliable communications
network. To help process the large
volumes of data generated by the
operation, Pitt’s computer center
has assigned relief efforts a high

priority Ploject-programmer num-
ber.

An experimental freeze-drying
method used to restore books
damaged in Last J anuary’s Langley
Hall explosion will be implemented
to recover Johnstown’s books and
public records.

According to Aug, faculty and
students set up a registry to reunite
separated friends and families.

Pennsylvania colleges and uni-
versities have offered Pitt Johns-
town assistance with ﬂood recov-
ery. According to the Associated
Press, busloads of Penn State
students have been driving to
Johnstown to help in the cleanup.
Organized by the school’s under-
graduate student government, the
program is aimed at helping elderly
people.

According to campus police Sgt. .

Jim Watters, nine EMT’s arrived
in Johnstown last Friday, served a
three-day shift and were relieved
by eight others. The rotating shifts

“We helped anyway we could,"
he continued. “We especially tried
to assist the elderly who were
confused and in shock. They kept
wandering away and we’d have to

The police worked to organize
traffic and the inﬂux of relief
materials, Watters said.

“The police took charge of the
inventory and dispensing of medi-
cal supplies, because they included
narcotics,” Watters said. _“We
performed as we would in Oakland

We‘ had to take extra care in

Student Activities, Terry Milani,
the Student Union is an ideal

location for collection. “It’s an
area that's manned and secure and
has sufficient storage area to keep
the material until it's ready for
shipping.

According to Milani. the mod.
erate response here is not unusual
due to the number of alternate drop
points available to commuting
students and staff.

ALASKAN PIPELINE
EXPLOSIONS DON’T STOP OIL

FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP)-
Explosions that authorities said
were deliberately set blew away
insulation on part of the Alaska
pipeline about 15 miles north of
here but did not interfere with the
flow of oil.

About 30 to 40 feet of an
above-ground section of the pipe-
line were damaged, Larry Talbert,
state deputy commissioner of public
safety, said yesterday.

The blast site is about a mile
north of a cafe and about five miles
off a state highway in an almost
jungle-like area thick with spruce,
willow and birch trees.

Talbert said wires, batteries and
what appeared to be detonators
were found near that section of the

channels and ﬁled a
complaint with the Equal Employ-

(EEOC) in Washington. The
EEOC, according to Johnson,
suggested the University settle out
of court, as they found evidence of
sex discrimination and cause for
back pay and tenure. The
University refused to settle and in
1973, Johnson ﬁled suit under the
Civil Rights Act of 1963 and Title
VII. Title VII prohibits sex
discrimination in colleges
universities. ‘
In May of 1973, Knox handed
down an injunction allowing
Johnson to continue working at Pitt
during _the trial.

and "

800-mile pipeline operated by
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.

State Police Lt. George Pollitt
said there were ‘ ‘ apparently several
blasts” in the area.

Aleyska security officers reported
the damage to authorities about 9
p.m. Monday night, but Talbert
said the explosions probably
occurred on or before last Saturday.

“There was blast damage to the
insulation on the pipe and to the
pipeline supports,” Pollitt said.
“The insulation was torn away and
blown away in some spots.”

Some sections of the pipeline are
underground and others are above
ground. The above ground sections
rest on metal cross-supports
elevated by steel posts about six
feets high. Pollitt said some
cross-supports were dented.

The explosions occurred at a
section of the pipeline which slants
downward into a small valley about
150 yards north of point where it
goes underground. The pipe is
about three or four feet above
ground at that point, the closest it
comes to the ground on that section
of the line.

Exposive devices “appeared to
have been placed in the pipeline
support structure itself,” Pollitt
said. “We don’t know what type of
explosive material was used, and
we don’t know how much was used.
But it deﬁnitely was a man-made
cause.”

Aleyska official said there was no
halt in oil ﬂow in the line. The oil
front had reached Mile 740 on
Tuesday morningand was expected
to reach the pipeline’s southern
terminal at Valdez on Thursday or
Friday.

Alyeska security personnel, the
FBI and the Criminal Investigation

/ Bureau of the Alaska State Police

were investigating the blasts and
sealed off the area from reporters
and curiousity seekers.

"II Year: of coiiogim Joumaiian at the University or Pimburgn"

 Cozyness Beyond

The Call of Duty .

One sure-fire way to make a problem disappear is to declare it to

no longer be a problem.

That’s the way the School of General Studies (SGS) Student
Cabinet Council, with newly appointed Night Times editor
Rosemarie Freeman, solved the question of whether the night

school newspaper should be independent of its student govern-

ment.

Presently, the student government reserves the right toname the

editor of the paper and to make editorial decisions. Earlier this f

year editors quit over what they saw as a question of freedom; they
wanted to reserve the right of the newspaper staff to select its own

editors and choose its

own editorial direction.

Weeks later the SGS Student Cabinet Council rejected a proposal
that would have given the paper editorial autonomy and the right to

select its own editor.

Surely, this would have caused another
protest from the Night Times staff.

And this protest would have occurred if the Night Times still

existed. But it is gone.

It apparently has been replaced by a

position paper, an official newspaper of the party in power; a
diseminator of what the SGS Student Cabinet Councilrthinks is
newsworthy. This paper will still call itself the Night Times; it still
wil use the Night Times logos. But it will not be, in spirit, the

Night Times.

The editor-in-chief, Freeman, said for the record that everything
was working fine and, “there seems to be no need for changes.”

This seems to be a very credible statement until one realizes that
she is the editor recently appointed by the student government, a
government that was not looking for an editor expounding First

‘Amendment freedoms from a soapbox. This government wanted

an editor who printed what he was told to and then shut up.

Of course, it is possible the new,Night Times will break away
from its current cozy relationship with the cabinet and become a
reasonably credible newspaper. But recent events do not make us"

hopeful.

Letters to the Editor

Why Does Education Cost Rise?

A The cost of education at Pitt is
again on the rise!

“Why should it be so,” I ask you?
The treasurer will probably say that
it’s due to the costs of maintainance
going up. “You know that we ran
short of heating fuel last winter,”
he might add. The Chancellor may
use the phrase or phrases that

employe’s raises cause the costs to
increase.

Reading between the lines, it
should say, “We’ve got a small
group of teachers that forces us to
spend millions defending our
position in court.”

This group of educators, with all
their knowledge of debate and

reasoning to logically deﬁne a
problem, can't cope without a
judge. They should either hire a full
time judiciary or leave all decisions
pertaining to hiring and ﬁring up to
individual departments, leaving our
tuition expenses where they are, not
in some lawyer’s pocket.

President Carter has called for

The whole problem was brought

calls for stripmining Wyoming into
one giant crater to get soft coal and
shale to send to a plant and convert
into crude oil.

Crude oil from coal and shale?
Why not go in the other direction,

Thomas Merlin, of the University
of Utah’s large particle 1aboratory’s
department of heavy metal re-
search, is close to a breakthrough on
the synthesis of gold and other
precious metals from base ele-
ments.

R. Stiltskin, former co-worker of
Professor Merlin, has taken Mer-
1in’s process one step farther,

claiming to have perfected a process
that spins straw into gold. Though
vehemently denied by the Univer-
sity of Utah, Merlin and Stiltskin,
reporters from a Mormon news-
paper stumbled upon the research
while investigating a broom short-
age in Ogden.

Researchers at Minnesota’s
Seminary of the Ascencion have

claimed to have discovered a
profitable method of transmuting
ordinary grape juice into wine. A
spokesman for Christian brothers in
California accused the Minnesotans
of divine inspiration which they
piously denied.

Engineers at Kansas’ Laura
Ingalls Wilder Institute have
utilized a natural phenomenon that
creates mountains out of molehills.
The state’s Department of Envi-
ronmental Resources plans two big‘
hydroelectric plants on waterfalls
created by the amazing process.
The travel bureau is already
building two ski resorts on proposed
mountain sites. Senator Robert
Dole will be on hand at Mike’s Peak
for the gala opening and will throw
out the ﬁrst mountain goat.

In the same vein as the
mountain research, the federal
government has revealed plans to
construct a machine, that, when

would be in agreement with his
decision. An unconﬁrmed rumor
has it that Nyden was invited to eat
in the kitchen with the servants, in
accordance with his proposed
relationship with the department. I
wonder if any faculty member
revealing the fact that such a

given an inch, will take a mile. This
is to compete with a European
Common Market device that when

given a centimetre, takes a
kilometre.

The Treasury Department, along
with the U.S. weather bureau have
scheduled pennies to fall from
heaven on New York City, possibly
as soon as June. Encouraged by
their success with money that grows
on trees (an idea which was later
stolen by the Franklin Mint and
used to produce commerative
apricots) treasury officials plan to
be a little more cautious about
guarding their secret process this
time.

Though obviously piqued at the
Franklin Mint, located in the city of

dinner was given should be deﬁned
as having “violated the conﬁden-
tiality of faculty meetings?”

brotherly love, treasury officials
deny a rumor that they have slated
anvils to fall on Philadelphia next
week.

In response to world hunger, the
Iowa cereal institute has perfected a
bread which they claim an average
man or woman could live by alone.
The discovery was hailed by an old
vaudevillian comedian who recom-
mended it for people who really
kneaded the dough.

Obviously, making cliches into
reality is America’s new frontier.
There is no time for delay. These
new devices must be mass produced
as soon as possible. For, as they say
in Philadelphia, an anvil saved is an
anvil earned.

Freshman Fall Camp:
Friends, Fun and Sun

By LYNN OSGOOD

For a college freshman, the ‘

first taste of collegiate living may
mean eating food less savory than
Mom's apple pie and sharing
quarters with an “all right”
stranger commonly referred to as
“my roommate.” And though the
food may turn out to be tolerable in
the months ahead and the
roommate likeable, college life
remains a series of adjustments.

Freshman fall camp, held Sep-
tember 16 through 18 at Camp
Lutherlyn in Mars, Pa. is one way to
introduce a freshman to college life.
Its purpose, according to a camp
brochure, is to ease the student into
unfamiliar University surroun-
dings.

The camp staff consists of 50
upperclass counselors, 10 upper-
classmen on the staff, 10 on the
committee, 40 faculty and 300
freshmen. The activities coor-
dinated by the counselors, staff,
committee and faculty members

vary, but each freshmen group
participates in similar activities.

Weekend plans call for an
intoductory dance Friday night and
a sports competition Saturday.
Freshmen will ﬁnd themselves
donning hats and “mitts” as they
wind up for some softball competi-
tion or ﬂags and “pennies” as they
gear-up for a ﬂag football match.
But before the liniment and ace
bandages can appear, they will be
amidst a multitude of evening
activities including a casino night
and late night cookout.

As the weekend closes on Sunday
evening, all groups will get the
chance to participate in a song and
dance competition culminating in
an all group talent show. The
overall winning group of the
weekend competition will receive a
trophy for its efforts.

' It should be a weekend for
freshmen to make a few friends
and have a lot of fun at the same
time.

Bringing in a supersonic jet on a 10,000 ft. cement runway is tough
enough. But landing one on a 500 ft. piece of a carrier deck, moving at
25 knots, is even tougher. Only a few men are good enough to do it. And
they’re all Navy trained. How can you become a member of the Naval Air -
team’? One way is to join while you’re still in college. One of the advantages
of being part of the Aviation Reserve Officer Candidate (AVROC) Program
is that it lets you continue working toward your degree.

Getting your Navy Wings isn't easy. The training is tough. The least
that will be expected of you is the best that other pilots can do. Their limits
are your starting blocks, their expertise your pfimer. But if you succeed,
your future is assured whether you remain in the Navy or not.

Replacement Shows Aren ’t Successful

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Couple shows are the vogue on
prime time television these days.
First there was “Sonny and Cher”
which clicked as a replacement a
few years back, returned in the
CBS winter lineup and spawned a
_slew of imitations like “The
Captain and Tennille” and “Donny
and Marie.”

The original “Sonny and Cher”
employed some novel techniques
such as cartoons and the writing
featured occasionally witty, adult
situations. Not so for the others.
Tennille spent much of her time
joking about the silent Captain’s
ever-present hat and the Osmond
clan’s bright molars probably
dazzled potential orthodontists, but
what else was there but few good
musical numbers?

Two new shows joined the ranks
this summer that are dismally

disappointing. “The Billy Davis,
Jr. and Marilyn McCoo Slow” and

The Thornbirds --
By Colleen McCullough
Harper and Row

“The Thornbirds” has been
billed as another “Gone With The
Wind” and the comparison is well
deserved. Author Colleen Me
Cullough writes very much like
Margaret Mitchell and both books
are big, sprawling novels of a
bygone era.

“Thornbirds” is basically the
story of Meghann Cleary, only
daughter in a large Irish family that

“Shields and Yarnell” are addi-
tional blows to the dying variety
format.

lt’s particularly a shame in the
case of the latter as Robert Shields
and Lorene Yarnell are incredibly
talented mimes. Their mechanical
couple, the Clinkers, was a
highlight of every “Sonny and
Cher Show.” The writers fill up
the show with moronic skits that
don’t display the duo’s talent and
the musical numbers are a total
waste.

As for McCoo and Davis, they
were fine as part of the ‘Fifth
Dimension. Their hit single, “You
Don’t Have To Be A Star,”
propelled them into their television
show. Their weekly rendition of
the song is easily the high point of
the evening. But the song gets
pretty boring as it takes up a‘ good
sized chunk of their half hour and
the rest goes downhill. What’s
remarkable about this show is that
it went on anyway after the

emigrates ﬁrst to New Zealand and
then to Australia. Meghann
becomes the innocent pawn in a
destructive game plotted by her
jealous but wealthy aunt, who is in
love with a priest who’s in love with
Meghann.

Sounds a bit soap operaish, but
McCullough has a good ear for the
Irish dialect and her knowledge of
Australia during the 1920s and ’30s
is impressive and impeccable.

For the most part, the characters
are drawn out well but McCullough

‘couple’s so-so appearances on
other variety shows.

“Fernwood Tonight” is Norman
Lear’s summer replacement for
“Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.”
“Mary Hartman” will return this
fall minus Mary (Louise Lasser)
and will be retitled “Fernwood,
USA.”

“Fernwood Tonight” is a talk
show hosted by Barth Gimble
(Martin Mull), who also played
Barth’s twin brother Garth, a wife
beater who was accidentally
impaled on a fake Christmas tree’s
branch in one of “Mary Hart-
man”’s funnier episodes.

“Fernwood Tonight” is ob-
noxious, irreverent and loony. The
first few shows saw Barth hosting
such notables as a mother who
wants her son deprogrammed from
a religious cult (he’s a Roman
Catholic priest). The problem is,
where will it go when the cultural

“Thombirds ’-’-A New Classic?

does leave some gaps. For
example, why would the priest strip
in front of the greedy old aunt? It
just .doesn’t fit. Also, Meghann is
not completely explained. She’s
beautiful, hard working, and long
suffering but there’s no drive or
dazzle. To say the least, she’s. no
Scarlett O’Hara.

As for “Thornbirds” itself, it’s
both more and less than “Gone
With The Wind.” But if you
enjoyed one, chances are you’ll
like the other.

By PATTY TASCARELLA

“A Bridge Too Far” combines
the elements of two all-time box
office hits—It’s a disaster film and
it’s got a big namescast.

The movie is based on a true
story——an Allied attempt to capture
a Dutch bridge from the Nazis that,
contrary to the tradition of war
movies, fails miserably.

Go see this for spectacle, not
acting. While the cast includes
Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Ryan
O’Neal, Liv Ullman, Elliot Gould,
Robert Redford, James Caan and so
on, they’re not on the screen long
enough to give the slightest
impression of acting.

In the long run, you'd be better
off seeing “Star Wars” again.

New York, New York
Directd by Martin Scorcese

This film is another combination.
Director Martin Scorcese and
Robert DeNiro, who teamed
previously for the powerful “Taxi

Driver,” mix with Liza Minelli, who
belts out John Kander and Fred Ebb
songs (they scored “Cabaret”). (It
works and it doesn’t work.

Minelli plays a big band singer,
much in the tradition of Doris Day,
but she sings like Garland and
climbs her way to the top. Her
husband (DeNiro) is a saxaphone
player with personality problems-
there’s violence underneath his
comic facade.

Both put in fine performances
and Minelli does not overshadow
DeNiro in the way Barbra Streisand
swiped scenes from Kris Kris-
tofferson in “A Star Is Born.” A
good job is also done by Mary Kay
Place as Minelli’s best chum and
fellow singer.

The problem is that Scorcese
dwells on too many slow scenes.
The movie should either be a
melodrama or a big production
number, nothing in between. And
it’s here that “New York, New
York" stalls.

Still, Minelli’s voice is in top
form,‘ the music is first rate, and
that alone is worth the price of
admission.

Will Football Camp
Be Hood Victim?

Catching up on a slow sports summer:

Unmentioned (probably because it is of interest only to the few
rabid Pitt football followers and to a few freeloading sports repor-
ters) in recent discussion of the J ohnstown flood tragedy has been
the fate of Jackie Sherrill’s first fall football camp.

The situation is “totally up in the air,” a Pitt spokesman said
yesterday, with several sites—including Pitt Stadium——under con-
sideration. The problem of finding a facility at which one can
house, feed and practice more than 100 football players, coaches
and freeloading sports reporters will not be a small one, especially
at a time when most other schools are looking for the same thing.
And the potential injury to Jackie Sherrill’s squad and season is not
small... ’

 

xi

It was interesting to hear Jackie Sherrill say he was counting on
help from his freshmen from the onset of this season. The question
is: , Are Hugh Green, Benjy Pryor and Rooster Jones truly in
Sherrill’s immediate plans, or is this Sherrill’s way of extracting ef-
fort from a group of guys still possessing fresh memories of their
first glimpses at Pitt’s female population? Look for Pryor to start
immediately, and the others to play larger roles, with other first-
year players, as the season progresses...

Pi-tt is doing Matt Cavanaugh no small disservice by pushing him
for the Heisman. Matt would do better served by publicizing the
fact he is a very good college quartetback who will help his team
measurably come fall than by linking him with what Pitt hopes
(dreams?) will be its second Heisman in two years. Matt, level-
headed as he is, contributes to his cause——all—america is a distinct
possibility——by maintaining a cautious, sensible public profile...

Has anyone noticed that Pitt’s basketball team will start next
season with six players who expect to be a starters? According to
latest NCAA rules, even a team coming off a six-win season can
employ only five players at a time, so look for disappointment (or
worse) from Sam Clancy, Mike Rice, Ed.Scheuermann or Larry
Harris. Harris’ worst apparent fate would be a switch to guard,
but if he stays at shooting forward one of the other three will be
coming off the bench. And if ‘Harris does switch, look for high-
flier Sonny Lewis to be making his departure from the bench...

Pitt’s new scoreboard will be installed at the stadium soon, and
Pitt spokesmen say it will “be as good as any other scoreboard in
the nation, on the collegiate level.” It will have “limited cartoon
potential” and should be operational in time for Notre Dame and
the TV cameras. A new artificial surface is being laid, with work
nearing completion.

Pitt will announce a new assistant basketball coach before Friday
and a new graduate assistant, probably at the same time. With the
new blood, some experience and a fairly easy schedule, Tim
Grgurich could have a very good season...

But, then, that’s what I thought last year...

Tony Dorsett’s claim his public misadventures are overpublicized
may be true, but he is not one to talk, considering what he has got-
ten away with based on his reputation. The big winner is Pitt’s
sports information department, which no longer must worry about
the bad publicity...

This is not to say that Tony is a bad guy. In fact, I hope he does
well with Dallas this year...

But not too well, since his ability to speak brashly and later live
up to his boasts is unsettling...

To answer the, question, how profitable is Pitt football: a local
restaurant manager approached Pitt recently about advertising a
free—Coke offer on the back of each football ticket. Pitt’s tickets
apparently could not handle the request, since they are printed by
computer, but the manager siad he would try again next year. This
year, to compensate, he plans to stay open all night, since “they’ll
want something to eat and need time to stagger over here after the
bars close.”...

The new scoreboard, I hope, is not one in a chain of attempts to
modernize Pitt Stadium because, with the exception of some Old
benches in the non-exclusive areas, it is fine as it is... , _

If Playboy’s pre-season college football forecase doesn t put Pitt
in the top five or six, it will prove, at least to me, that the only good
parts of that magazine are the pictures and that Anson should be
stuffed and mounted... _ _ _

How can anyone think of football during weather like this?...

PITTSBURGH (AP)—-John Can-
delaria’s four-hit pitching was
backed by the hitting of Frank
Taveras, Omar Moreno and Ed Ott
giving the Pittsburgh Pirates a 3-2
victory over the Houston Astros
Tuesday night.

Candelaria, 11-3, was hit in the
left forearm by a line drive off the
hat off Wilbur Howard in the eighth
inning and was taken to a hospital
for X rays.

The tall left-hander was not in
trouble until the eighth when an
error and his second walk of the
game put two aboard with one out.
Then came the shot off Howard’s
bat to load the bases. Rich Gossage
came on to ﬁnish the inning, but not
before Enow Cabell hit a sacriﬁce
fly to score Roger Metzger.

J. R. Richard, 9-8, took the loss.

Catcher Ed Ott drove his ﬁfth
homer of the season over the right
ﬁeld wall in the seventh inning for
the winning run.

Taveras’ and Moreno added
triples to the Pirate attack.

Three-base hits accounted for
both of the Pirates’ ﬁrst two runs.

Taveras tripled into the right ﬁeld
corner with one out in the third and
rode home on Dave Parker’s single
to right center In the ﬁfth, after
Cedeno’s home run had tied the
score for the Astros, Moreno led off
with atriple to right and came home
on Taveras’ sacriﬁce ﬂy.

Cedeno hit the first pitch
Candelaria served him with one out
in the fourth for his home run, a line
drive into the seats in left center
nearly 400 feet from the plate. It
was the 19th g homer hit off
Candelaria in 21 startts this season
and Cedeno’s ﬁfth of the season.

The victory keeps the Pirates 2‘/2
games behind the Chicago Cubs,
3-0 winners over Cincinnati earlier
in the day.

inning Tuesday night, leading the

Steve Garvey’s 23rd home run in

The Dodgers started their

Terry Harmon, but Backer was able
to beat Harmon’s throw to third.
Burke then doubled over the head of

score Baker. The Dodgers added
two more runs in the inning on a
wild pitch by reliever Ron Reed and
a passed ball charged to Tim
McCarver. 7

Los Angeles added another run in
the eighth on a double by Baker and
a single by John Hale.
