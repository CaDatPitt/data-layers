For Friday

Fraternity Group Presents
Larry Funk’s Orchestra
At Annual ‘Formal

By Charlotte Levy

It may not be‘ leap year, but the
men are waiting and the women are
making the dates for the Panhellenic
Ball, Friday. For the first time at a
Campus Dance since the Heart Hop,
the women will foot the bills, with
only the worries of corsages a11d
transportation left to the men.

Larry Funk will make his debut on
campus playing at the Urban‘ Room
of the William Penn hotel. M1‘. Funk
comes here from Covington, Ky.,
after an engagement at the New
Lookout House there. He has also
furnished the music for prom-goers
at Yale, Harvard, and Princeton.

Larry Fnnk’s orchestra has often
been called the “band of a thousand
melodies.” The dancing will begin at
10 o’clock and will continue until 2
o’clock.

Marion Messer, Ed37, vice-presi-
dent and social cl1airma11 of Panhel-
lenic Council and chairman of the
dance, promises to create a Greek at-
mosphere for the Urban Room by
novel decorations which are to re-
main a secret until Friday night.

The Ball is a traditional formal af-
fair sponsored annually by Panhellen-
ic Council. Also, as in previous years,
this formal dance, climaxing the
Council’s social events, is exclusively
for fraternity women. Ti-ckets have
been priced at three dollars. Any
money which has not yet been turned
in should be taken to Miss Scott in
Heinz House as soon as possible.

Dr. and Mrs. John J. Geise and Mr.
and Mrs. Robert S. Corley are to be
chaperons at the dance. Members of
the faculty and administration will
be there as the guests of l’anl1cllenic.

Coed Eleetidns Ope-:3
  Voting Season Today

Sipes Hits
Assembly

Selections

Students Asks Representation
On Ballot For hlinority
Group Candidates

 

Student-Faculty Assembly, meet-
ing for its regular monthly session,
was prepared for an early adjourn-
ment after routine business had been
cleared up, late last night, when
Brooks Sipes, C39, non-member of
the assembly, was given privilege to
speak.

Sipes began by questioning the
purpose of Men’s Council and ﬁn-
ished by assailing recent nominations
made by SFA, claiming faul'ts in the
nominating procedure and “discrim-
ination against minority groups.”

This discussion came immediately
after Hubert Teitelbaum, C37, chair-
man of the election committee, an-
nounced that voting machines would
be used at the polls one week from
Friday for the ﬁrst time in Univer-
sity history.

Blue identiﬁcation cards, ﬁlled out
a.t the February registration, will be
the sole means of recognition for
voters. The polls will be located only
at Memorial Hall, and will be open
from 9:15 to 5:30 o’clock Friday
April 23.

Questions Procedure

Sipes, appearing at the meeting ‘to
represent a “group of students” who
questioned the nominations procedure
of SFA, desired a speciﬁc explana-
tion of the work of ‘the executive
committee in selecting nominees.

He based his complaint upon the
fact that when he took out a peti-
tion, he was “told ‘that nominees had
practically already been decided
upon, and that he might as well de-
posit his petition in the waste bas-
ket.”

This assertion was questioned by
Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men, who stated the work of the com-
mittee as deﬁned in the constitution.
He claimed that both the spirit and
the letter of the constitution had
been followed in selecting the nomi-
nees.

Dr. Lanfear’s statement was cor-
roborated by student members of the
committee, speciﬁcally by Teitelbaum,
Schenck, and McQuade. Sipes pointed
out that of nine petitioners in his
group only one was nominated by the
committee, and he because of an al-
leged political trade that “somebody
had told me about.”

“All we want,” Sipes insisted, “is
a system which will give us a chance
‘to appear on the ballot.”

"Write-Ins" Suggested

A suggestion was immediately
brought up that “write-in” votes
might possibly solve the problem.
Upon consulting the constitution, it
was discovered that no provisions
had been made for write-m votes;
Previously, however, SFA had inter-
preted the constitution to disallow
votes_ for persons not nominated for
the executive committee.

Paul Kromer, C37, pointed out that
the present system permits the per-
petuation of any clique which hap-
pens to obtain a majori'ty. Dr. Lan-
fear refuted this statement by point-
ing out that in Student Council,
SFA’s predecessor, under the system
of unlimited voting, it was known
beforehand not only who would be
nominated but also who would be
elected.

Expressing her desire to see a
broadening of the constitution, Dr.
Lotte Lohstoetter, associate professor
of modern languages, stated that she
hoped that a constructive idea would
come out of the meeting, and moved
that write—in votes be honored.

At this point the presence of a _

quorum was questioned, and it was

Class Heads, Senior Queen,
Alma Mater" Designated
At Balloting Today

By Ruth Hilscnrath

(See list of Nominees on page four)

None of the back-slapping and
electioneering which characterizes na-
tional elections will be evident to-
day when women go to the polls to
make their ﬁnal choice for women
officers. Instead the voting which will
take place from 9 to 4 o’clock on the
boardwalk leading to Ileinz House
will be entirely free of campaigning.
In case of rain, the Heinz House
porch will be the center of activity.

Les.der3 for six activity groups,
three women's classes, and the Senior
Queen and Alma Mater will be decid-
ed at today's elections. A.ll women
carrying 12 or more credits are eligi-
ble to vote for WSGA officers and
leaders for their classes. According
to a ruling adopted two years ago,
women members of the faculty and
administration may also ballot in the
WSGA division.

All members of the WAA who have
paid their yearly dues are eligible
for voting in that organization. Vo-
ting in Panhellenic Association will
be limited to voting members of fra-
ternities and in the Debating Associ-
ation to varsity and the i'rcslnn:m (le-
bnting 1lll,‘llll)f3l'S. All students enrolled
in Women’s Choral have voting priv-
ileges in that organization.

Pictures At Polls

Voting today will be of special sig-
niﬁcance to all senior women. Tlicy
will have the opportunity to pay the
greatest honors which can be given
to two senior women, the election of
Senior Queen and Alma Mater.

This year something new will be
tried at the polls. Each organization
will have pictures of all its women
nominees posted on the ballot box in
order that students might be familiar
with the faces as well as the names
of the women for whom they vote.

Elections will be supervised and
the ballots counted by members of the
Senior Court comprised of Ruth Sha-
piro, C; Betty Reiger, C; Kathryn
Hardy, C; Elinor Scott, C; and Mar-
cella Leyton, C. Students will be in-
formed of their elections tonight, and
the results will be published in the
next issue of The News.

Commons Room
To Be Completed
Before May Day

With more than 60 per cent of
the slate floor in the Cathedral Com-
mons Ronni a.lrc.ady laid, prospects
look bright for finishing this work
before May 1, thereby practically
completing this room, the University
planning department announced to-
day.

The seven'th floor of the Cathedral
is now being completed and will be
the new home of the departm.ent of
fine arts. It should be finished by
early summer, Albert A. Klimcheck,
University architect, says.

Included on this floor will be a
large exhibition Lrallmgv and a read-
ing room. All ligliting will be of the
semi-indirec't type.

Limestone to be used in the stair
halls of the ﬁrst three floors, as well
as a slate shipment for the first floor
corridors around the Commons Room,
is due to arrive at the University
within a week, Mr. Klimchcck stated,
after which all possible efforts will
be directed to ﬁnisliine; the corridors
at an early date. With this shipment
of stone, all the limestone for the
Cathedral will have arrived.

Hoot Mon!

Drawings For Scottish Room
Will Arrive Here Soon

Full-size drawings for the Scottish
Nationality Room and the details for
the wood carving have been mailed
from Edinburgh and will reachthe
University within the next few weeks‘,

Reginald Fairless of Edinburgh,
architect of the classroom, has chos-
en the magniﬁcent plaster frieze of
the Elcho Castle in Perthshire as
the inspiration for the frieze of the
room. The design for the carved on-
trance doors at Rowallan Castle in
Ayrshire has been adapted for the
classroom doors that flank the
wood-burning ﬁreplace and its
carved over-mantel. Portraits of six
distinguished Scotsmen will hang
upon the plastered walls.

The atmosphere of the whole room
dates back to the early 17th century,
a period when Scotland was most iso-
lated and therefore least inﬂuenced
by the outside world.

Dr. John B. Sutherland, head
coach of the University’; football
team, is the chairman of the Scot-
tish Room Committee. Vice-chain
men are Mr. James Brown and Mrs.
George Hale; Miss Helen Beattie is.
secretary.

There are many.-'and._dev_ious means

in which‘ case the‘ Parntlrei-s will win.
?This- categorical satement has been
derived from the fact that no team

lt is common knowledge that
inofst athletes are superstitious to a

ladders, chew pebbles, place chew-

all: sorts of fetishes calculated to
insure victory. We would place
Numerology above these in that it
does not attempt to force success,
but, rather, predicts the outcome of
the game in order that no one, not
even the player himself, will have
to worry about it.

Ahem, Gentlemen !

A Freshman manners handbook en-
titled “What Every Man ' Should
Know” has been compiled by Dr. Lan-
fear, dean of men and Robert ll. Cor-
ley, assistant to the dean of men, for
use in Freshman orientation classes
and men's fraternity houses. Copier;
of the handbook will be placed in the
library and in the 13 fraterni'ty houses
this week.

Originally prepared for fraternity
men, it was decided to extend its use
to the orientation classes because it
contains material in a condensed form
needed for research by those classes.

The handbook contains essential
rules and customs concerning social
relations and etiquette for men, stated
in a‘ concise and pointed manner
which permits easy reference. The
contents include discussions of: pub-
lic conduct, street, business and Uni-
versity manners, social and business
correspondence; ‘telephone cur’uesy,
‘travel conduct in the automobile,
train and hotels, smoking manners,
introductions, invitations and replies,
customs of dress and at dinners, man-
ners for dances, fraternity parties.
teas, receptions, and» card parties,
manners at ‘the fraternity house, club
meetings, restaurants, the theatre.
concerts and lectures, and rules of
conduct for house parties and for
house guests.

‘People In Italy Happy,’
Asserts Italian Legato

 

According to Dr. Georgia M. Bom-
bassei-Frascani of the Italian Consu-
late of Pittsburgh, who was recently
guest speaker at a meeting of the
Italian Club, everyone in Italy is per-
fectly happy.

They do not know what unemploy-
ment is, they know very little about
sit-down strikes, and they do not
think of Mussolini as a dictator, as
we do, but they regard him almost as
_an-infallible-person, the speaker said.

Seethings, oilings

ESPITE the coming of
-spring, political and social
questions still continued to
seethe and boil above and below
the surface throughout the na-
tion this week. The automotive
strike situation, which was set-
tled a short time ago, monopo-
lizes space again and ‘again in
the headlines; " _ An organizing
campaign has even moved across
the border into ‘Canada, where a
premier who would have been
considered reactionary in the
nineteenth century fulminates
against a host of imaginary alien
influences and reasserts, with
more vigor than sense, a theory
of industrial relations damnable
per so.

In Europe one tense situation
follows on the heels of another
with scarcely breathing time be-
tween. Millions of men under
arms, other millions working
overtime in factories, millions of
plain everyday people: all these
wait nervously for the long-—
expected “something” to happen.

In India and China, national-
ist movements, long dormant,
gather power and sweep on to
their own conception of manifest
destiny. Japan, implacable and
austere, guards what she has,
prepares to reach out for more
because she feels that she can-
not exist securely without that
addition.

It’s almost bromidish to say
that this is not a pleasant spring-
time — these April days and
weeks of 1937. Not that the New
Year of 1937 ever held any great
promise of peace and content-
ment, but certainly‘ all the in-
trigues and threats and counter-

threats appear unreal, a shifting- .

phantasmagoria which will come
to an -abrupt end whenever the
evil dream passes.

But it’s no nightmare. It’s a
fact, and must be accepted and
faced as such.-——J. D.

Sound and Fury

By James Donoghue

IF NOTHING else, Monday’s deci-

sions of the venerable U. S. Su-
preme Court effectively destroyed the
illusion that the Court was not a po-
litical body, nor an interpreter of the
constitution, but an impartial, unemo-
tional body which applied ‘the consti-
tution regardless of the effects -that
the application caused. -A 

The Great God Baal

THE realization that the Court has

been a policy-making body much
as the President or the Congress
does not come as a profound shock
to most Americans who take an in-
,terest in the shifting currents of gov-
ernment and politics; for they had
widely suspected all along that the
Court was merely enunciating a rela-
tively abstract theory which had no
basis in fact. The various bon mots
which have appeared and reappeared
in various disguises during the pres-
ent reform controversy testify that
there was no particular agreement
with the majority of the Court's view
of the functions of the Court. But
“The Supreme Court follows the elec-

tion returns” and “the constitution is

what the justices say it is” have now
been stamped with the imprimateur
of the Court itself. The bon mots
were never complimentary nor were
they intended to be. But they were
truthful, and when invested with a
sort of moral rightness, it seemed as
though there were little point in be-
ing nice in matters pertaining to the
power of the government to regulate
hours, wages, and the labor of chil-
dren. ‘

It was a vicious alternative that
the Court was presented with in the
Wagner cases. Whichever horse it
backed was bound to be the wrong
one; and.-the whole question ﬁnally“
boiled down to the Court choosing
the horse which was least likely to ﬁn-
ish last.

But the decisions of the Court have
the same effect upon the public as if

Attention Cavity Fillers

On a recent trip to Virginia,
Harry Fleichman, had a date with a
young lady who had been through
the marriage mill for the second time
. . . Upon arrival at her apartment
at 4:30 A. M. after a tough nite, she
informed Harry in a somewhat shock-
ing manner that Jimmy was home . . .

Sucker

Larry Orr recently gave his fra-
ternity pin to a. certain Joan
Young . . . It has been said that
they are both trying to take" each
other for the proverbial ride . . .
And we are apt to agree with this
theory on the affair as they are
publicly splicing ﬁngers with other
parties.

Open Letter to a. Prankster

Somebody either willfully or play-
fully stole three pictures autographed
by Glen Gray, Kenny Sargent, and
Pee—Wee Hunt from Ben Baskin at
Friday’s IF . . . Since they were auto-
graphed to Ben, they couldn’t be of
much use to anybody else . . . If you
are a gentleman, return them to the
Sammy house, 425 Neville, no ques-
tions asked . . . Thanks . . .

the god Baal himself pointed to his

Sawdust

THE general public is bound to take 0

_ the v1ew_that ‘the Court all along
has been ﬁring blank cartridges, and.-
cartridges ﬁlled with sawdust at that.
Not even the humanity of a Brandeis
nor the judicial eloquence of a Car-
doza or _a Stone can save the Court
from being considered the last, soli-
tary, rather cold refuge of illogical
contradiction; that the Court is not a
body of Solons but a conglomerate
body of sometime Republicans and
Democrats who have conservative or
liberal leanings and who vote not for
the letter of the law so much as for
the peculiar opinions which they hold.

Vestal Virgins & High Priests

THROUGHOUT the last hundred
. years of our history the constitu-
tion has been considered the symbol
of some high mystical national unity.
The document, which was envisioned
by the founders of the Republic as
an instrument of government, was be-
lieved to be something sacred, a sort
of writ from on high. And the Court
which had taken over the task of say-
ing what the constitution was,
achieved the status of a modern Del-
phic Oracle, the contact man between
the mystical and the practical. As
prie:-ts, of course, the justices, were
regarded with awe and were treated
accordingly.

The veil of the Temple has been
rent, and by the Court itself, not from
choice but because it was maneuvered
into a position where it was bound ‘to
lose either way. And now, despite
a hundred years of constitutional his-—
tory and marble aloofness, the Court
is‘shown to have human blood in its
veins.

There is no need of a silver bullet
