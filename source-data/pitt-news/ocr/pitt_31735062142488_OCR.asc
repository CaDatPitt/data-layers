Leiber points out that the hours

Uncertainty caused by the war
situation has made this move nec-
essary. With the lowering of the
draft age to 18 years, most of the
men students face an interruption
of their educational studies and

dancing, and then, because the af-

freshments will be available.
There is a possibility that the

1943 book will be the last for
the duration of the war. The Owl
has received a letter from its
printer stating that after Jan-
uary 15, 1943, only 25 percent
of the engravings used last year
will be allowed for yearbooks.
This will not affect the 1943 book
for 75 per cent of the book is al-
ready in the hands of the printer.

The makeup of the yearbook is
completed. Most of the writeups
and photographs have been taken
or will be soon. However, this is
only the preliminary work facing
the staff. Getting the book in ﬁnal
form is the heaviest work ahead.

Use of freshmen, sophomore and
junior pictures will not cost the
students any extra money. Last
year the cost of the book to un-
dergraduate was $3.50 and that will
be the charge this year. Under-
graduates will be required to make

For a solid hour the students
who packed the downstairs of
Stephen Foster Memorial listened
attentively to Dr. Sherwood Eddy,
internationally known lecturer and
traveler, and then left with the
realization that the war might last
at least three years more and that
a “spirit” is driving both the Rus-
sians and the Germans on toward
their respective goals.

Starting off in his “Three Dic-
tators” discussion, he spent little
time with Mussolini, calling him,
as have others in the past, “a jack-

goal in which they believe so
desperately.

‘ “Even in the cold of 40 below
zero,” he continued, “I have seen
German soldiers bloody with
wounds and covered with vermin
raise their right arms as best
they could to salute and cry,
“Heil Hitler.”

In Russia again the same spirit
of determination is evident. He
cited the story of having seen 4,000
students filing by the tomb of Len-
in, and coming away more deeply
imbued with his principles of eco-
nomic and social equality for which

at least $5,500 in stamps and
bonds. Actually the total is high-
er, but since the price of a jeep
has been set at $500, approxi-

far behind in our effort to reach a

Men's fraternities are now con-
ducting individual and personal
sales drives, turning all receipts

over to the committee. Phi Epsilon

the drive.

Tomorrow the women of Delta

The plan for military victory over the Fascists
is in sight. Blurrred by distance into. time, its
vision is indistinct, but we can see the over-all pat-

‘ tern that allied strategy will someday take — a

drive onto Southern Europe, then North, supported
by a Russian offensive made possible by Allied dis-
persion of German troop strength. *

The plan for idealogical victory over Fascism,
equally important for ultimate victory is still in-
visible. We’re being shown by our army and navy
that we can win the war. We’re being shown by
reactionary diplomatic and domestic policies that
after we do win it, We’re still going to have to
ﬁght against the same evils that brought Fascism
into being.

Like imperialism. Does the Atlantic Charter
apply to India or doesn’t it? If it does, India must
be granted immediate freedom. If not, that whole
document must be scrapped immediately lest all
our stated war aims become distrused by a lie

such as this. -/

Is this war “the end of imperialism” as New
Zealand’s minister to the United States told three
hundred and ﬁfty students from all over the world
last summer—or is Winston Churchill‘ predicting
the shape of‘ things to come when he states his
intent to see the British empire kept intact?

Ask the Russians freezing at Stalingrad, or the
Marines battling on Guadalcanal if they think that

they’re dying to keep the British empire intact._
. Or ask the British boys ﬁghting along with us in

New Guinea if they think the Burmese or the

I

Words Ami Enough  

natives of Hong-Kong would have put up a better
hgl_it_ against the Japanese if they thought that a
Britisli victory would mean the end of their ex-
ploitation. .

And we’d_ better come out soon against some of
the social injustices of our own country. The
British common people have been given some idea
Of What they’re going to get——they’re being told
that all their ﬁghting and dying is for something
positive and concrete. The recent Beveridge re-
port promises that every Briton will get decent
and digniﬁed birth care, medical care for as long
as he lives, old age compensation, unemployment
insurance at greatly reduced prices. Government
planned and carried out.

Something similar to this must soon be forth-
comng in our own country. And it better not be
beaten down by the commercial insurance com-
panies in combination with the American tories——
who will undoubtedly scream “Socialism, bureau-
cracy, infringement upon private enterprise,” at
this and every other social gain that’s on its way.

And our state department better stop nurturing
every pro-Fascist element within the United Na-
tions—like the failure of the Chinese Kuo-Mintang
to deal honestly with the Chinese People’s Army.
And now that the Allies control the North African
phosphate‘ deposits upon_wh_i‘ch Spanish agricul-
ture depends for its very life, it seems possible now
to quit appeasing Franco and use a little plain
honest geopolitics to get him away from the Axis.

But before this can happen our State Depart-
ment has got to stop thinking in terms of the old

 

balance of power politics and diplomacy—and;b,5el A
gin thinking in terms of an all out_ ﬁght against
fascism, against the fascists, against the pro-,.~

fascists of any nation. A _little_ plain, honest-,~>
straight-forward, virile action, instead of _the 
nebulous almost mystic protocol and mechanations. P‘

that have been going on, would go a long wayin,
helping us believe that this is a People’s Revolu-
tion. ’ ‘

Mrs. Roosevelt, Vice—President Wallace, Sn-' 
preme Court Justice Robert Jackson, War Produc-_ .
tion Board member William Batt, Sumner Welles‘, 

and dozens of others high in our government have
told us that this is a people’s revolution and must

inevitably lead to the century of the Common Man.) 

And if words were enough, the Common Man

would have a millenium by now. 

This editorial is not meant to discredit Britain,

or China, or the United States. Military victory 
depends upon the close kind of unity. And all the *
progress that We’re going to make depends upon‘ 
that military victory. But look, unless we start jf

now, in the conduct of the war to give some con-‘ ‘
crete demonstration that we’re preparing for the
People’s Century—if we wait until the peace

table to begin" planning—this war wll be as effec- 3"

tive in winning that century as the last one was in .
making the world safe for democrcay.

All that we, who will soon be ﬁghting in this
war, ask, is a few demonstrations that even after,
we do win the all important military victory-—-the
peace that follows isn’t one which will return to
the old system which caused the rise of Hitlerism.

The last two weeks have brought
to the Alldred Room a number of
unusually interesting and timely
books, as well as some of the best
of the recent ovels.

Four of these new books deal
with countries involved in the
war effort: “Alaska Under
Arms” by Jean Potter, “Brazil
Under Vargas” by Karl Loewen-
stein, Katherine Mitchell's “In-
dia Witltout Fable,” and VValter
Carroll’s “We’re In This With
Russia.” Many consider the lat-
ter two as the best and most ob-
jective studies so far written on
these countries for the lay read-
er.

Of course, he said, the Com-
munist party has been ruthless
in the execution of its ideals, and
for this reason many cannot
stomach them or listen to

thoughts of communism.

But, he continued, they have a
well-developed economicaland so-
cial plan. And without such a plan
or similar social thought, the Unit-
ed States can never expect to re-
duce the gap between billionaires
and the thousands of the slum
areas. ,

Post-war reconstruction also
entered into his talk. No longer,
, he declared, will the small states
of Czechoslovakia and'Hungary
stand alone. Instead there will be

a federation of the small states

in this area and other areas, a

federation of the Scandinavian

nations, a free India, closer re-
lationships between North and

South Americas, and the col-

onies of the world governed by
 a central mandate. The theme he

kept coming back to was “feder-
ation and strong police power.”

Music As Morale Builder

By VIRGINIA VOLKAY

“Today in England music teach-
ers are in great demand by the boys
and girls. They ﬂock to learn to
play musical instruments, since
they don’t have much chance for
schooling,” stated Theodore M. Fin-
ney, professor and head of the de-
partment ofniusic appreciation.

In an interview about music in
the war, Mr. Finney said that
the English people, as well as the
rest of the world, realize ‘ that
music is a great morale builder.
Russia believes in the “entertain-
ment for morale’ policy and still
continues its ballets and theaters.

He explained that here in Ameri-
ca the Advisory Music committee in
Washington sends song books to
soldiers. They supply camps with
the phonograph records the men
want. The Committee sees that
every camp has a piano. Now, they
are busy selecting musicians to be

are bound to get worse, not bet-
ter. But the player shortage res-

mains the biggest problem of all.
Many of the boys have already
indicated that they will not by
back next year. ‘

Working opportunities elsewhere
have lured many of the boys from
school and there is a feeling preva-
lent among the boys that there is
little use in starting to school
when they won’t be able to ﬁnish.
Tht 18-19 year old draft effects
have not yet been felt. But, noth-
ing deﬁnite can or will be known
about the schedule until February.

Panther Cagers Open Season Thursday

iilGreel< Hoopsters in Close
Race; Four Teams Unbeaten

By MIKE HERMAN

Inter-fraternity basketball main-
tained its lively pace as the third
round was passed last week, with
four teams battling for the title.
The favored Enigma Chi team
shares ﬁrst place with Phi Delta
Theta, each with 3 wins and no
losses, and they are closely follow-
ed by SAM and Phi Gamma Delta
with 2 and 0.

Pi Lambda Phi and Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon have each won one
game and lost two, but neither has

_ ﬂashtd the form necessary to win
,- the basketball crown.
The ﬁrst Sammie-Phi G-am
' game was thrown out after the
Phi Gams had protested the game
"on the grounds that the SAM’s
‘ had used an ineligible player. Red
Silverman, former varsity per-
former, had been ruled ineligible
. / on the grounds of his former var-
‘ sity competition, but he played
 anyway. The Fijis, who lost the
game, protested, with the result
that the game is to be replayed.
Silverman will be allowed to par-
 ticipate in future I-F competition.
~ Hottest team in the circuit are
he the Sigma Chis. ‘who, after licking
the PiKA’s by 8 points, came roar-
Wfing along to wallop last year’s
.’"runner-up Theta Chi outﬁt, 42-9,
ﬂfand then beat the champion Phi

Kap outﬁt 54-28. Big guns for the
Sigma’s are Paul Bobcnage and
“Speed” McCloskey, who made :20
and 21 points in the Phi Kap game.
respectively.

These two are sure to be in the
individual scoring race, along with
SAM’s “Hack” White, who has
tallied 35 points in two games.

Last Tuesday's results showed:
Phi Gain 29, Pi Lam 13; SAM 31,
Delta Tau Delta 19; Phi Ep 56.
APD 29; Sigma Chi 42, Theta
Chi 9; Phi Delt 41, Phi Kappa
26; SAE 28, PiKA 27.

Thursday’s results: Phi Gain 23,
Delt 17; Pi Lam 26, APD 4; SAM
37, Phi Ep 23; Phi Delt 30, SAE
28; Sigma Chi 54, Phi Kappa 28,
and PiKA with a forfeit win over
Theta Chi.

l.etterman’s Club
To Meet Today

The University Panther Club, un-
dergraduate letterman’s organiza-
tion, will hold its ﬁrst meeting of
the semester today at 12:30 in
Room 232.

President of the club is Aldo ~

Icardi. In '_t'orrr.er years, the secre-
tary-treasurer was Ben Grady, for-
mer swimming coach, who held the
position permanently. It has not
been ﬁlled since Grady left for the
Navy.

The purpose of this meeting is
to facilitate reorganization, since
the men who recently received
their “P” are eligible, and as yet
have not had a chance to indicate
their willingness to join the let-
terman’s society. All varsity let-
ter winners are eligible for mem-
bership.

lcardi stated that the student
group was attempting to contact
the Graduate Letterman’s Club in
order to cement relations between
the two groups. One of the ideas
under consideration now is the pro-
vision for a banquet for varsity
teams. It has been over two years
since the men of any squad sat
down to a banquet together at the
end of a season.

Language Fraternity

Sigma Kappa Phi, honorary lan-
guage fraternity, held its regular
semester initiation last Wednesday
night, l).ecember 9, at one of the two
dinner meetings scheduled for this
year. Because of war conditions the
rest of the meetings will be held
at noon with the members bringing
their lunches. The speakers will be
obtained from the University fac-
ulty.

By JERRY R PP ’

Pit.t*s basketball team opens its current season two weeks
earlier than had been originally scheduled as they meet Beth-
any on the Stadium ﬂoor this Thursday night. Final arrange-
ments tor the game, which has been pending for the past two
weeks, were completed last Wednesday.

Not having expected to open the season until December I

31, the Panther cagehs must go
through an abbreviated tapering
off process. Dr. H. C. Carlson de-
clared, however. “We’ll be ready
for Bethany.”

Coach of the visitors is Jack
Knight, who ﬁrst gained national
prominence about 12 years ago by
coaching the Wheeling high school
team to the West Virginia state
title. He then took his team to
national scholastic championship
tournament and came away with
the consolation crown.

Starting five for the Blue and
Gold will be the same quintet. that
has started all the practice games
played up to now. Tay Halarkey
and Bobby Artman will be at the
foirvvards, Johnny Swacus and Walt
Jones at the guards and Paul LOl1—
nieyer will jump center.

Not much is known about Beth-
any. Last year they went through
a thirteen game season without a
victory. On the basis of this Pitt
shouldn’t have too much trouble
notching a win in their ﬁrst con-
test of the season.

The game this Thursday should

also give some indication on how

well the new “blitz” system the

Panthers are using will work out
in future encounters. While the
Bethany game will probably be
the easiest on the Pitt card, the
visitors should be able to furnish

enough opposition to adequately

test the new system.

Captain for Thursday night's
game will be either Tay Malarkey
or Bobby Artman, who have been
appointed co-captains for this sea-
son.

All the Red Cross First Aide
classes will meet as scheduled be-

Paul “Bullets” Palanzo, C44,
member of The Pitt News sports
staﬂ’, was recently selected as sports
publicity director of the city of
Monessen.

Largely responsible for continu-
ation of the city basketball league
of Monessen under adverse condi-

presidency because of school activi-
ties, but accepted a position as ex-

Following in the wake of War

Palanzo is arranging to bring an

Dr. Paul Zehfuss, University Graduate
Promoted To The Rank Qt Army Mai

Most college students have some
one thing they want to do after they
graduate——which they seldom really
do. Not so with Paul E. Zehfuss
who was at one time assistant health
director at Pitt. Paul, when he was
enrolled at the University, had two
such desires and he has accomplish-
ed both of them.

The one was to practice medicine.
He graduated from Pitt medical
school in 1934 and interned at West
ern Pennsylvania Hospital. In 1935
he returned to his alma mater to
serve as assistant health director
and to achieve his other desire by
serving also as assistant basketball
coach.

Now a surgeon of the Chesapeake
Bay Sector, the one time college ace
is a booster for athletics in and out
of the army. He still favors basket-
ball as the ideal sport. “The game

gives you speed, endurance, andi

agility which are good qualities for
ﬁghting men,” he asserted.
