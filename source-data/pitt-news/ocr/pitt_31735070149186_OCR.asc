Chancel|or,six other University
officials receive salary increases

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

The freeze has thawed on Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg’s salary.’

_ The Compensation Committee
of Pitt’s Board of Trustees froze
Nordenberg’s salary for the 2011-
2012 ﬁscal year, according to his
request in December 2011, but on
Tuesday morning in Posvar Hall, the
committee recommended that Nor-
denberg receive a 3.3 percent raise
for the 2012-2013 ﬁscal year, taking
his annual salary from $561,000 to
$580,000. The board also recom-
mended salary raises for seven top

University officials, including Chan-
cellor Nordenberg.

Last year, Nordenberg refused
a raise because of economic cir-
cumstances. According to Board
of Trustees Chair Stephen Tritch,
Nordenberg accepted the raise this
year on a condition.

“This year, we were able to per-
suade him to accept an increase, as
longas it did not exceed the lowest
of the percentage increases to be
awarded to any other officer,” Tritch
said in a press release.

Tritch said that the committee
determined the raises and salaries
based on benchmarking conducted

by a professional consultant. He also
said that the current salaries of Pitt’s
top officials -“lag[s] behind appropri-
ate benchmarks.” ’

In the press release, Tritch also
reviewed some of the work Pitt’s top
ofﬁcers took on this past year.

“In the face of daunting chal-
lenges —— from the extended series
of highly disruptive bomb threats to
new recommendations for a second
successive year of deep cuts to state

Pitt, CMU collaborate to

expand music experience

Pete Blais
Stew” Wrz'ter

Live music performances have re-

cently become cheaper for college
students in the Oakland area.

In some cases, it’s even free.

The University of Pittsburgh’s
music department and Carnegie
Mellon University School of Mu-
sic have created a program that
allows free admission to these
schools’ concerts for students at
both universities. This marks the

‘ latest development in what’s been

a long-standing relationship be-
tween the two universities.

' ‘ It was almost 60 years ago that
administrators within Pitt and

' CMU assigned themselves speciﬁc

music education programs.
“There was a concerted ef-
fort between music people at the
schools who got together and
said, ‘How can we all offer music
programs that make sense?’” said
Robert Fallon, a music professor
at CMU. “So there was a deliberate
division oflabor. One is music edu-
cation and training music teachers,
which Duquesne took over. CMU

‘took over performance. Scholar-

ship and musicology went to_Pitt..
It’s formed a really great com-
plementarity between the three
schools. It’s that kind of comple-
mentarity combined with’ a Pitts-
burgh friendliness that gives rise
to a collaborative environment,”
The general idea behind the
free concert initiative is nurturing
this sense of community between

the two schools while simultane-

ously exposing students to classi-
cal music. Faculty at both universi-
ties expressed concern over a lack
of student exposure to classical
music today.

“I have two intents. One is to

get more people at CMU School
of Musicvfunctions. The other is

. to‘ get younger people at School

of Music functions, and that is to
say classical music functions, in
general,” said Denis Colwell, head
of CMU’s School of Music.

While both universities have
had student groups giving concerts
for decades, they are just now be-
coming free for students.

-“Our ticket prices are afford-

able to begin with: they’re $5. But

ﬁrst and foremost, we’re commit-
ted to having people exposed to
the concerts,” said Dana Casto,

‘ director of marketing and com-

munication at CMU’s School of
Music. “We’re very cognizant to
the fact that students have limited
income.” 1 _

“My hope is that by making it
easy for students from any univer-
sity to come to the School of Mu-
sic functions for free, the program
bears fruit,” said Colwell.

CMU’s School of Music boasts
a symphony orchestra and cham-
ber orchestra, as well as a wind
ensemble and jazz ensemble. They
also produce multiple operasand
musical theater performances ev-
ery year. Pitt students are now able
to attend all of these performances
free of charge with a student ID.

“We’re really interested in mak-
ing sure that not only the CMU
campus community but also Pitt’s
community has access to the per-
formances that the school of music
does. We felt like one of the easiest

‘ways we could do that is to see if

Pitt students would like to utilize
the opportunity to get into the con-
cert for free with ID,” Casto said.

Department’s communications

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

SGB recommends a cut to Te|eFact’s funng

Megan Trimble
Senior Staﬁ" Wrz'ter ' ‘

There was one question that TeleFact could not
answer Tuesday night: How would _the group
receive ﬁ1n'ding in the future? A'

During the hour and 45 minute meeting, the
Student Government Board moved in its ﬁnal
meeting of its term to make substantial changes

in the funding of TeleFact in front of about 40 —

people gathered in Nordy’s Place. TeleFact is
one of ﬁve formula groups — non—Student Or-
ganization—Resource- Center-certiﬁed groups
that are funded by ﬁxed percentages of the
more than $2 million Student Activities Fund
that SGB works to distribute. The other four
formula groups include Pitt Program Council,

Panther Prints, Student Volunteer Outreach to

and 92.1 WPTS—FM. . t t _

-  President James Landreneau introduced
an amendment to Resolution 0001 of the SGB
constitution to the Board. The amended reso-
lution recommends that TeleFact no longer

‘be considered aforrnula group at the start of

ﬁscal year 2014 due to an increase in usage that
merits formula—group status. TeleFact currently

receives 3.4 percent of the Student Activities

Fund each ﬁscal year. A A

e . TeleFact coordinator Kayla Mormak spoke
on behalfof the organization, which functions
as-.a type of operating service by taking calls
from students and supplying them with an-
swers, in opposition of the Board’s proposed
recommendation.

Mormak said she was concerned that the
group would no longer be able to meet its pay-_
roll, employ students and function as intended.
Citing that the group has been in existence for
20 years and has serviced 2.5 million calls,
 said that she_ felt the group “deserves a
 more than six months’ notice to make
 appropriate changes, considering that [she
 already made $20,000 worth of cuts in
payroll.”

1  Board member Halim Genus said he sup- _'

ported reducing the ﬁmding, due to the group’s
_d_rastic decline in use by the student-body.
 said that $85,000 to $87,000 goes to
 funding of the group, which uses 85 to 90
pelfcent of its fundingfor payroll.

“I suggested tothe Board that we don’t look

' To improve the reception of the group’s
services among students, Mormak said that
TeleFact is working to develop an app that will
encourage and ease the process through which
students propose questions.

“We need some time to make those changes,
and it’s not going to happen overnight,” she

' said.

TeleFact operator Brian Sperling argued
Te1eFact’s decline in activity as “not a service
issue, [but] a publicity issue.”

‘ Board member‘ Zoe Samudzi questioned
the efforts that the group had put forth to enact
improvements in the group’s publicity, if that
was in fact the central issue. ,

Mormak responded that after six months
without an adviser, the group was in ﬂux and
working to make changes.

Landreneau stressed that approval of the

resolution would only be a recommendation
to Vice Provost and Dean of Students Kathy
Humphrey and Director of Student Life Kenyon
Bonner, who would make the ﬁnal decision on
the group’s status.

“This is something that, in terms of formula

. groups, has notbeen looked into substantially

inthree years,  And even then, I don’t
know how in-depth they have gone into bud-
gets,” Landreneau said. “It would not be an
immediate cut, but I can tell you right now
that the recommendation of the Board does
resonate with Dean Humphrey and Kenyon.”

Landreneau said he has spoken with presi-

dent-elect Louderback about looking into the '

Chryst says he’s

“committed”

to Pitt football g

prosraﬁl

, .
Pitt head football coach Paul Chryst reaf-
‘ﬁrmed his commitment to the Pitt foot-
ball program in a statement Tuesday night
amid speculation that he might depart
Pitt for a head coaching position at the
University of Wisconsin. -

The Associated Press reportedNTues-
day that Wisconsin head football coach

Bret Bielema had signed a contract with '

the‘University of Arkansas, opening up
the Badgers’ head coaching position. Be-
fore arriving at Pitt in December 2011,

-‘Chryst —— a native of Madison, Wiscon-

sin — played quarterback on the Wiscon-

t“| am committed
to the Pitt football

program and  
the University of

Pittsburgh.”
Paul Chryst

sin football team from 1986 to 1988 and
later served as offensive coordinator for
the Badgers for six years. Because of his
close ties to the university, speculation
has arisen that Chryst might be a prime
candidate for the new opening created by
Bielema’s move. _ I t -

“I understand the speculation sur-
rounding my name given today’s develop-
ments,” Chryst said in the statement. “I am
committed to the Pitt football program and
the University of Pittsburgh. I am focusing
all my time and energy on our team’s bowl
game preparation and recruiting a great
group of young men to join our program
and -this outstanding university. We are
working hard every day to re—establish
this program and I am excited about the
future of Pitt football.” Q

coordinator, said that while CMU has es-
tablished itself as a performance—oriented
‘conservatory school, Pitt has much to offer,
as ‘well.

“There seems to be an ongoing issue -— I"
think because we’re a small music depart-
ment here, and we’re kind of a humanities-
oriented department —— that there aren’t
musical groups performing here on Pitt’s
campus. But there’s a lot going on here all
the time,” said Thompson.

Pitt puts on two concerts each year pre-
sented by the music series Music on the
Edge, which is devoted to the performance
of contemporary music by professional mu-
sicians. There are also several world music
concerts featuring Pitt’s African Music and
Dance Ensemble and Gamelan ensemble.
CMU students are now offered free admis-
sion to these. i

While the offer of free admission might
entice some CMU students to attend these
events, the obscurity of the world music
offered at Pitt is attractive to some, as well.
Music students are encouraged to take

_ advantage of courses that are cross-listed .
between the two schools. This means a full— V
time undergraduate student at Pitt or CMU

can take a music class at either school to
fulﬁll a requirement at their own school.

“I’m constantly telling my students, look
at Pitt, there might be something there for
you. I know that some of our students, for
instance, take classes at Pitt, particularly
the world music ensembles. We have basi-
cally no world music ensembles, because we
focus almost exclusively on classical music,”
Fallon said.

Also, faculty members between the two
schools occasionally ﬁll in for one another
when needed. Fallon also said he ﬁlled in as
an adjunct professor when the music depart-
ment was searching for new faculty last year.

“There are some graduate students who
require committees for the doctoral exams,

or there’s dissertation committees. I’ve sat.

in on those committees if the topic in ques-
tion has something to do with my special
[French music],” Fallon said. '

December 5, 2012 l The Pitt News I vvvm/v.piitnews.c0m

This sense of community is embodied
in the recent free concert initiative. Casto
said he expects the program to grow due to
certain advertising efforts, including emails
and newsletters to inform the faculty at CMU
and Pitt, ﬂyers posted around Oakland and
the surrounding neighborhoods and talk
from student audiences. '

“I expect this to grow in kind of an or-
ganic kind of way where, hopefully, we
would have some students go to a concert
and they would want to come back and tell
their friends,” Casto said. g

Both Pitt and CMU have the abilityto
track how many students attend their con-
certs. Casto said that at a September CMU
orchestra concert, approximately two dozen
Pitt students were in attendance — a num-
ber previously unseen at such an event.

Casto said he was pleased with the turn-
out, but that there’s still room for improve-
ment. . .

“What’s paramount about being part of

‘a schoolof music, not only forthe music

students but for the campus community, is
about exposure to music and the perform-

ing arts. We’re very committed to not only
‘ our students.-pbut the community in general,
— about'music,” he said. V

‘ Likewise, Colwell said young people
don’t get nearly enough exposure to clas-
sical music  . 7 p ‘T _ . -

“Classical music has been fractured over
the past 20 or 25 years, but one of the net
results is that young people aren’t as exposed
to classical music as they once were. Music
programs at primary and secondary schools
have been cut or eliminated entirely. What
used to be typical in t_erms_of exposure to

     

\ classical music is no longer typical. We have

awhole generation of people who don’t know
what classical music is,” Colwell said.
_ Fallon reiterated this sentiment and reaf-
ﬁrmed the importance of classical music.
“Pop culture will tell you what to listen to
and you can’t avoid it. Classical music doesn’t
really work that way and exposureto it be-
comes a little more unusual and, therefore,
to be valued,” Fallon said.
While classical music might be disregard-
ed and under-utilized by many young people
today, Thompson echoed one resounding

sentiment. “It’s just good to hear live music.” ~

The Board voted to approve the resolution

Landreneau thanked all involved in SGB for
the effort that they put forth during his time as

Chief Investment Ofﬁcer Amy Marsh re-
ceived the highest raise at 15 percent, taking
her salary from $352,000 to $405,000. In a
press release, Nordenberg recognized that
Marsh’s raise resulted in part from other in-
stitutions’ efforts to recruit the investment
officer. v '

“[T]he fact that we had fallen behind our
[salary] benchmarks took on a measure of
unwelcome reality when she became the tar-
get of a very serious recruitment effort,” he
said. “The steps that we took to retain her,

driven by her strong performance in serving
the University for the past 13 years, resulted
in a salary increase that remained within ap-
propriate benchmark levels.”

As chief investment officer, Marsh manages
the University endowment funds and serves
as Pitt’s treasurer.

Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor Patricia
Beeson received the second—largest raise of 10
percent, taking her salary ﬁgure to $374,000.

“[W]e knew in setting her starting salary
that it was low, reﬂecting the fact that she was
new to the position,” Nordenberg said in the
press release. “We also knewthat we would

Wednesday, it will have to pay
attention to the Dukes’ shoot-
ing ability from deep, as a failure
to do so could propel the Dukes
to their ﬁrst victo-ry in the City
Game in more than a decade.
The Panthers will head
Downtown to Consol for the 81st
City Game against the Duquesne
Duke at 7 p.m. e This year marks
the third st_raight time the home
of the Pittsburgh Penguins has
played host to the annual match-
up. Pitt enters the game looking
for its 50th victory in the series,

currently leading with 49 victo-

ries to Duquesne’s 31.

But entering the game, Pitt
(7-1) will need to be wary of the
Dukes’ three—point shooting,
which has been occasionally hot
this season. Overall, Duquesne

hits 32.9 percent of its attempts _

from long range with Quevyn
Winters leading the team at a
43.8 percent clip from beyond
the arc.

In her tenth season at the helm

look to tie the current all—time

A winningest coach in Pitt history,

Kirk Bruce, with a win tonight.

Following an upset loss on the
road at Lafayette on Saturday,
the Panthers (5-2) return home
for a nonconference matchup
against Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference opponent Loyola
tonight at 7 p.m. at the Petersen
Events Center.

After the contest, the Grey-
hounds (4-4) will continue on
to upstate New York to play
Syracuse and Army before the
MAAC schedule begins. Pitt'will

play ﬁve more games (two home,

three on the road) before Big A

East play begins on Jan. 5 at Se-
ton Hall.

The Greyhounds enter the
game riding a two—game win-
ning streak, a double-digit vic—
tory over Lehigh and a two-
point squeaker over American.
In order to continue their win-
ning streak, they will have to
reverse a trend — an 0-3 record
in games versus Pitt. The series
began in 2010.

Last year, the Panthers tack-
led the Greyhounds in a back-
and-forth battle at the Petersen
Events Center by a score of 65-
59.]unior Marquel Davis record-
ed a career—high 17 points and
ﬁve rebounds in the game.

Senior guard Katie Sheahin
(15.5 ppg, 5.5 rpg) leads the visi-
tors’ scoring attack and is the
only Loyola player to average
double ﬁgures this season;

Pitt will aim to rebound af-
ter having its ﬁve—game winning
streak snapped on Saturday.
Leading scorer forward Asia Lo~
gan (16.3 ppg, 7.9 rpg) and gaurd

Brianna Kiesel (12.4 ppg, 4.7 _

rpg) lead the Panthers’ offensive
attack.

But the true test for the Pan-
thers will be defense, especially
against a Loyola team that has al-
ready attempted 150 three-point
shots this season. The Panthers

Homestead product H  '1Batch(16) ed the Steelers to victory over?/th‘e
. Ravens on Sunday. M Cam‘ s H ' ‘  7  ’ ‘    H-

 

I love Steelers fans for trmlkreasons: For V
-one, because I am -one,  I certainly

love myself. And two, they are completely
shameless when it comes to ﬂip—ﬂopping,
which is absolutely hilarious.

Witness Charlie Batch.

The 37-year-old veteran quarterback,
who is really only still in the National
Football League because’ he is friends with
Big Ben, led the Pittsburgh Steelers to
victory, 23-20, over the hated Baltimore
Ravens this past Sunday. Maybe you heard.
It’s kind of a big deal around these parts.

Chuck, as mentioned, is only around
because Ben enjoys his conversation. His
football mind is sharp, but his mobility
is poor, and his arm strength rates
somewhere around my grandmother’s.
After a disastrous” game against the
Cleveland Browns last week, people were
calling for his head.

The feelings remained negative after
the ﬁrst half against Baltimore this past
weekend. Watching him miss a wide—open
Mike Wallace in the end zone —— Wallace,
for that matter, would still have had to
catch the pass, a skill that has consistently
eluded him this season —— and nearly kill
the sound guy kneeling ﬁve yards out of
play made me want to put my foot through
my TV (my roommates restrained me,
thankfully). '

I spent all of halftime joining in with
the chorus of yinzers around Western
Pennsylvania pontiﬁcating on how bad
Batch sucked and what the Steelers
should do about him in the second half.

   
 

 

 

Never  he spendsﬁa. considerable '

amount his . salary contributing
to charitalilm, programs in his native
Homestead,’l"you could feel the vitriolic
hatred coursing through the Pittsburgh
a1r. _ -
From fan favorite to most hated, just
like that. Can you blame us?‘ We were
about to lose three games in a row to the
Ravens and Browns — there would have
been a riot in the streets of the Steel City
if that happened. _

Lo and behold, Chuck came through.
His passes stopped dive bombing the
ground and started ﬁnding the hands of
open receivers —— who actually caught
them, it should be noted. He threw a block
that allowed Jonathan Dwyer to score his
ﬁrst professional touchdown. He led the
Black and Gold when it mattered, driving
the Steelers 61 yards down the ﬁeld to set
up Shaun Suisham’s game—winning ﬁeld
goal astime expired. ' -

The image of him nearly breaking
down on the sideline following the
game and embracing Ben and seemingly
everyone else within arms’ reach was
touching. It looked like a ﬁtting end to his
career; Roethlisberger seems nearly ready
to return from his injury, and the 37-year-
old Batch can resume his life of wearing a
headset and holding a clipboard.

Charlie Batch, you return to
Pittsburgh’s good graces. We Steelers fans
apologize and humbly ask forgiveness:
Will you please allow us to like you again?

‘ Unless of course, you need to start
again next week. Then we’ll wait and see
how you do. I

.iamie'Dixon and Pitt fans alike get up for the City Game, which the team has wonlthe
last 11 times. Steve Garﬁnkel | For The Pitt News ’

coming off victories, with Pitt having
beaten Detroit Saturday — overcoming a
slow start to erase an eight—point deﬁcit
in the second half —— and Duquesne pull-
ing its record over the .500 mark with an
87-73 victory over the Maine Black Bears.
Dixon reﬂected on the importance of the
rivalry game.

“[We’re] looking forward to the game,”
Dixon said. “It’s an opportunity, I think
it’s a great game, great game for the city.
And like I said after the last game, I was
going through my notes and saw atten-
dance was close to 16,000 [last year],
which says a lot about how important this
is to the city.”

Speciﬁcally, the 2011 City Game last
season set a record for the annual contest,
with an attendance of 15,880 spectators.

Robinson was named the Big East
Freshman of the Week this past week, as
he played key roles in leading Pitt to victo-
ry over Howard and Detroit. Over the two
games, Robinson shot 60 percent from

the ﬁeld, averaging 11 points and 7 assists
in each game. Robinson now has his sights '

set on the matchup against Duquesne.

“It’s [a game] the older guys have been
telling me about since the last game end-
ed, so I’m excited,” Robinson said.

The Panthers coming off the bench are
also playing extremely well. For example,
junior j.J. Moore is the only Panther be-
sides Woodall and Zanna to average dou-
ble-digit scoring this season with his av-
erage of 10.8 points off the bench and 4.4
rebounds.

Also performing well off the bench’
is senior postman Dante Taylor, who is _

seeing the majority of his minutes at the
center position. Taylor is the Panthers’
second-leading rebounder at 5 boards per
game, and he leads the team with 21 offen-
sive rebounds.

As one of two seniors on the Panther
squad, Taylor looks forward to his ﬁnal
City Game -— even though he called it just
“another game.” . -
