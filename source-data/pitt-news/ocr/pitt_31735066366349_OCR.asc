Dave Urbaitis Resigns Position
As Student Directory Chairman

See editorial and
resignation statement on page 5.

By VICKI EPSTEIN

Dave Urbaitis, editor of the
Student Directory, has resigned.
The decisions of John Vrana, as-
sistant to the Vice-Chancellor of
Student Affairs, made it impos-
sible for him and his committee
to function effectively, Urbaitis
said.

On Monday, 200 copies of the
Student Directory were delivered
and sold within one hour.

Another 560 were sold in four
hours. “We wanted to reorder, to
avert a run-out but were ad-
vised to wait until 1,200 to 1,-
000 were sold,” Urbaitis said. Near-
ly 1,300 books were sold out by
3 p.m. Wednesday.

“We are no more immune to
the tight budgetary controls than
many other student organiza-
tions,” added Urbaitis. Student
Government (SG) originally im-
posed a ceiling of $800 for the
preparation, compilation, publica-
tion, and distribution of the Stu-
dent Directory.

Last year’s Student Directory
was sold out although it wasn’t
as inclusive as this year’s. “We
were determined to prove that
the Student Directory could be
a self-sustaining project of SG.
Had the Student Activitities Fee‘
allocation been available to us
by Oct. 5, the Student Directory
would -have been available at a

much lower price, two weeks
earlier and we would not have
run out,” Urbaitis said.

The Student Directory asked
SG to appropriate $100-$150 more
to reduce the most of the direc-
tory by ‘large quantity order, and
“any money accrued from the
sale could have been used to en-
hance other SG projects, such as
Homecoming. Instead, I was at
first met with the possibility of
.a further out to $600. I would

have had to print it on paper
towels at that rate.”

“The 21 members of my com-
mittee and my two advisers
shared my feeling that with just
a little eﬁort this directory could
surpass the marginal success of
past directories. But, ‘as Mr.
Vrana, ﬁnancial adviser for stu-
dent organizations and sales man-
ager for last year’s directory,

said, the money just wasn’t avail-‘

able for the Directory in this
year’s budget.

“Too many SG projects which
follow the Directory,” Urbaitis
concluded, “would have to make
up the shortage if the Directory
‘went under.’ It didn’t, but who
was to know?”

Falk Library
Restricted
To Med Men

The Falk Library, located on
the second ﬂoor of Saife Hall, has
had -to limit its use by under-
graduate students because-of a
shortage of space. According to
Glenora Edwards, assistant to
the director of University‘ li-
braries, “Medical students who
must use this library had to be
turned away, because of the ﬂood
of undergraduates.

M.iss Edwards pointed out that
it is absolutely imperative for
He.alth Profession students to
have free access to the library.
The sources available there can-
not in most cases be found any-
where else, and,‘of course, these

-sources cannot be used unless

the students can ﬁnd seats.

Undrgraduates will not be to-
tally refused use of the library
where they can demonstrate a
unique need for its materials
that cannot be found i.n other

areas of the University‘. Those ‘

students’ who can demonstrate
,such a need, can pick up Are-

Senior Assistants in the

‘ Women’s Dormitories view

themselves in the role of
“mother, big sister, and
friend” to the girls on their
floors.

Thirty-two senior women and

seven graduate women have _the
role of Senior Assistants in Hol-

land, Brackenridge, -McCormick,
_and Tower C. They were chosen

on the basis of ‘interviews with
Savina Skewis, dean of women,
and the dormitory head residents.‘

The serve a function similar to

that of the men's dorm counse-
-lors. Included in their services

are .acting as a liason between the
Dean of Women, head resident,
and the, girls on their ﬂoors, and
being a counselor to girls who

’ need help with academic, dorm,

social, and personal problems.
Further they must maintain or-
der on their ﬂoors. For the com-
pletion of these duties they re-
ceive free room and board..
' Senior Assistants usually attend
weeklymeetings with their dor-
mitory head residents as well .as
floor meetings on Sunday eve-
nings. They also meet periodical-
ly with Dean Skewis duringthe
year.

Viewing the Senior Assistant

role as that of student‘ leader-

ship, Dean Skewis says: “I de-

pend on them completely for

creating within students the op-
portunity for each woman to have

.a successful, -useful. "University

fessional women functioning as

an extension of the Dean of

“They have a managerial op-
portunity. If we cannot put,con-
ﬁdence in senior women, we are
noteducating them properly,” she
concluded. '
The role of a Senior Assistant

‘ for freshmen differs from that of

a Senior Assistant for upperc1ass—

of themselves, socially," she said.

Senior Assistants with upper-
classmen play less part in orient-
ing students to the University.
They are still an important source
of information, however. Upper-
clasmen ask for advice when.they
are sick,when they are choosing
courses,‘ when they have aca-
demic or social problems, and
when they have questions, about
dorm regulations.

Upperclassmen are not always
as enthusiastic about doing things
because they have more demands
upon their time and more out-
side interests than freshmen. Dis-

formation about what courses to

she explained.

the floor duties with Miss Davi-
son, feels that the “greatest part
of the job is establishing the kind
of relationship that you want. I
feel that my role is almost that
of a- big sister. It is so exciting

they have more spirit and en-

The purpose of the convocation

the convocation is for all of us,

Vice Chancellor Rush suggest-

Mitchell Cause
Gets Disapproval

Editor, The Pitt News:

I think that the “scarecrow”
built by David Mitchell is noth-
* ing more than a blown up bal-
, loon. Mr. Mitchell stated he was
‘ ﬁned “for refusing to submit to
induction.” Less euphemistically,
he was sanctioned for being a
draft dodger.

During the past year, draft
dodging has become a common
practice among men eligible for
induction. The situation has de-
generated to the point where
schools have been founded for
T the sole purpose of teaching these
“ﬁne American men” how to
avoid the draft. These schools
teach such “reputable” methods
; as: how to ﬁll out a conscientious
‘objector form; how to feign
' homosexuality; .and, how to form
psuedo-ailments in order to ob-
tain “freedom” from selective
‘ service.

There is nothing wrong with
V protest. In fact, protest and criti-
cism are fundamental parts of
American democracy. These parts
‘are safety valves for dissent and
the means for change. But Mr.
Mitchell and those like him are
not conscientiously c r i tic i 2 i n g

 

policies. They are, instead, deny-
2 ing the legitimacy of American
government. They are attempting
to tear down the foundation on
which American government is
built.

stitution states brieﬂy, that the
Constitution, the laws of Con-
gress, and the treaties of the
United States are the supreme
law of the land. While disregard-
ing Article 6, Mr. Mitchell and
his followers, like many fanatics
of the past, readily turn to an-
other provision in the Constitu-
tion, the Sixth Amendment, in

-their own ends.

David Mitchell's reference to
the American soldier as being a
“murderer” is just a glittering
generality. The soldiers are no
_more murderers than the dough-
- boysof World War I or the U.N.

When 3,000 college students
marched in Boston protesting the
war, Mr. Mazza stated from his
wheelchair, “I don’t want to kill
anyone, not even a ‘Cong. But
I've got to protect myself, and
I've got to ﬁght for what I be-
lieve is right. I'm not a mur-
derer.” ,
I would like to ask Mr. Mitchell
and his retinue of “ﬁne Ameri-
can men” whether they think
themselves better than the sol-
diers who are neck-deep in mud,
blood, and death? Or are they

just above the United States gov- ,

ernment? I implore the student
body to act against Mr. Mitchell's
plea for revolution — for “a
movement with force.” And in
place of this attempt at revolu-
tion and draft dodging instill
again a respect and faith in
American law. Let us break this
balloon of juvenile hysteria. Let
us not degrade ourselves with
the intimacies and familiarities
of undeserving inferiors.

Editor, The Pitt News:

I was highly distressed upon
reading the letter published in
the Oct. 18 issue of The Pitt News
which was written by David Mill-
er upon the day of his arrest by
the FBI for the burning of his
draft card. I was distressed pri-
marily because Mr. Miller seem-

ed to have forgotten just which“

country he is living in. May I
remind him, and others who
seem to be sympathetic to his
“cause,"' .that this is still the
United States of America, not a
totalitarian dictatorship. May I
remind him, also, that if it were
not for the fact that it is the
U. S. A., Mr. Miller would not
even have been allowed to com-
mit such an action as that which
landed him in jail in the first
place.

The only reason that Mr. Mill-
er is now in‘ jail, instead of in
front of a ﬂing squad, is. that

almost two centuries ago, a group

of men decided to ﬁght for their
liberties as men, and against the
tyrannical oppressors who were
depriving them of _those liber-
ties. ‘And the characteristic which
has marked Americans from that

time forth. is that they have stood '4

More library space is necessary for the maintenance of a high academic level at
if the University. The restriction of the Falk library facilities to Medical students reﬂects
this need on the undergraduate level.

The reasoning for the restriction is justified. First, the library operates as a
“non-system library.” It is not equipped to serve the entire liberal arts community, but
is primarily oriented towards use by those in the ‘health professions.

Second, undergraduates demonstrat-.in2” 3' need £01‘ Specific materials releVant to
their liberal arts work may have access to the library. Third, the medical students, for
whom the library is primarily designed, were not gaining full access to its facilities.
The fact restrictions had to be imposed to alleviate the undergraduate contingent
“system” libraries is not being handled ade-

Many undergraduates merely used the Falk library because of its comfort, quiet,
good lighting facilities, and general physical qualities. They were not necessarily inter-
ested in the reference materials, but the study atmosphere.

There is not enough adequate study atmosphere provided to undergraduates in
the Cathedral libraries. Dr. C. W. Stone, head of University Libraries, and his start rec-
ognized this fallacy and extended library hours in an effort to provide more access to

On the other hand, Dr. Stone cannot expand library space per se because of ﬁscal
and physical limitations’. The educational reserve room and other areas are already
converted into cataloging and administrative offices.

The cataloging and storage areas are needed if the University is to expand its
reference resources. While the amount of usable materials (i.e., books, periodicals) in-
creases, there is not a proportional increase in the amount of space available to use them.
Books are no good unless they can be used. Courses are no good unless the ma-
, terial presented can be studied in an atmosphere providing profound individual thought.
The longer it takes to increase the quantity of libraries, the harder it will be to maintain
a consistently high academic level. i

And when they fought, it was
with all the resources at their

as if we had failed against King
George or Adolf Hitler, then this
noble experiment to which our
fathers gave their 'lives also

you have been improperly and

ready to fulﬁll your obligations

you had had the courage and

sponsibilities as an American

this land has preserved. for you
that now enables you to make
this “protest.”

Inasmuch as you have .accepted

just one ﬁnal suggestion -to you

and use the liberty. this country
has granted you to preserve those

that his visit failed to reﬂect fav-
orably upon the University, but
merely that his thoughts and
yours do not agree. On the basis
of this, you are prepared to state
that the University's choice to
honor him was not “judicious.”

When Dr. Commager appeared

at my tiny alama mater, Dickin-
son, several years ago, the ma-
jority of students who heard him
-held and probably still hold pol-
itical views similar to yours. Yet
there was no talk of him being
not a “judicious”_choice because
we could not agree with every-
thing he said. We were honored
to have this distinguished man
on our campus and we afforded
him the respectful audience that
a learned man of his calibre
should receive.

You see, Mr, Disler, the pro- .

cess of intellectual growth stops
as soon as we are not longer
willing to put our conclusions on
any subject to an object test by
exposing ‘ourselves to men and
ideas that are different from our
own experience. Or, to put it a
simpler way, a little knowledge
is a dangerous thing-.

Editor, The Pitt’News: 7

I was horriﬁed to read A.lan

Disler’s piece on Dr. Commager,
which you sanctiﬁed on the edi-
torial page of your Oct. 15 issue.
I can only hope that the circula-
tion of The Pitt News is meager
enough so that this article will
not become general knowledge.
Certainly, the recent rash if ir-
responsible ultra - liberalism on
many college campuses must be
challenged, but the reactionary
article produced by Mr. Disler is
not the answer.

' Disler’s espousal of the simple
answers to international prob-
lems is shocking. He must be
aware that there are no simple
answers and that in many cases *
there are no answers at all. Ac-
cusing Dr. Commager of ‘having
a “smug attitude” because he re-
fuses to oversimplify complex re-
lationships I find highly irrespon-
sible. . ,

vari_cation” by equating the Iil\/.11-V
garian uprising and the Domini-

can crisis is obviously absurd.
The existence of “hard-core Com-
munists” leading the Dominican
revolt was never establihed as a
fact. The popular will to depose
an oppressive government -and to
better conditions was obviously
present. Under these circum-
stances, the U.S. government had
no right to take unilateral acti, ~
and ‘invade the Dominican Re-
public. The fact that it did, for
the exact reason that the_ So-
viets invaded Hungary, to sup-
press a popular rebellion against
existing tyrannies, which may
have been in opposition to their
political philosophies, gives us no
reason to condemn one and praise
the other.

Our eventual hope lies in a
body of international law formed
byomoral distinctions and respect-
ed by all nations. Mr. Disler’s in-
sistence that we must be wary
of Communism creates .a tense-
ness in relations which leads to
rash and uncalled for acts such
as the Dominican blunder. It

John Vrana’s recent actions with the
Student Directory represent an outdated
approach to University administration
which must be condemned.

The outdated approach is one placing
authority in the University administration
to the extent of disregarding student_0I)111-
ion and student ability. Vrana had‘ ultimate
authority over the Directory s ﬁnances and
seemingly used it without.1‘€SD€<3l31T1_8” the
opinions of_ either ‘Committee Chairman
Dave Urbaitis or Irvrng'N. Rothman, direc-
tor of student publications.

Both Urbaitis and Rothman felt the
Directory should be reordered from the
printer without making further sales strict-
ly on an order form basis. Vrana felt it was
ﬁnancially infeasable to order except on the
order blank basis. The money man won.

Mr. Vrana’s position as an administrator
with ultimate authority can be Justified
when he uses that authority to ensure re-
sponsible student action. In this case, how-

9» ever, his actions do not appear to represent
a just fulfillment of his power and reﬂect a
basic contempt for students, even when
they act responsibly. ’

To justify Urbaitis’ work as being re-
sponsible is a matter of simple arithmetic
and observation of facts. Student Directory
received a budget of $800 from Student
Government; $200 was an allocation and
$600 was for expenses and had to be recov-
ered from proﬁts. Theexpenses. of the Di-
rectory to date (1500 copies printed) total
$800: $495 for printing, the rest for typing,
computer work, and miscellany. '

At that point the budgets were bal-
anced with only $600 needed from sales to
replenish the expense allotment. The Di-
rectory Committee sold 1300 directories in
two days, grossing $631 dollars._

On the basis of the record sales, the
$31 proﬁt, and a demonstrated demand for
more Directories, Urbaitis presented his
case for -reordering 500-1000 copies. These

Urbaitis Explains Exit

The follciwingts a statement of resignation
made by Dave Urbaitis, Student Directory head.

“Effective immediately is my resignation as editor of the Stu-
dent Directory.

“Nearly 1,300 copies of the Student Directory were sold in
fewer than 13 hours of selling time. It is inconceivable to my way
of thinking that there will be demand for no more than 200 copies
in the next week. 1

“Yet I have been informed by John Vrana, assistant to the
vice-chancellor of student affairs, that after much consideration
the decision “had been reached by Vrana, Vice-Chancellor Helen P.
Rush, John Robert Loch, and otherpeople than any further sales
should be on an individual order basis followed by publication
of only as many Student Directories as have been ordered.

“It is my ﬁrm belief that this is not performing a service to
students since this procedure would entail consideraable incon-
venience and delay in procuring the Directory. It is true that
everyone who wished to buy a Directory would have the oppor.
tunity to dolso, but because sales are now at their peak, I cannot
see burdening students, secretaries, and/or people at the service
desks with a clerical bog ‘of this magnitude when cash transac-
tions are all but dictated by the situation.

“A minimum of 1,500 man hours have been spent thus far
in getting the Directoriesto the students. Publications have had
a banner year in sales thus far, according to Irving Rothman, my
adviser. The Polaris has had to reorder for the ﬁrst time in its
history, and The Owl is having record-breaking sales. To fail to
provide the students with Directories they want, at the time that
they want them, is to me grossly unfair to the student body. If the
conscientiously calculated judgments of those people most closely
concerned with student organizations (the officers and advisers)
are to be disregarded when policy is to be made, then I can see no
reason for donating my time and efforts and that of my committee
if the ultimate service to the students is to be impeded or curtailed.

“Our research has revealed that most colleges and universities,
either provide a directory free of charge to students or at a com-
pletely nominal charge—with cost being offset by advertising.
Having been unable to utilize the facilities and resources of the
University as the situation demanded and without the active par-
ticiptaion of the members of SG the amount of time and effort
required of my committee has reached a level that any further
demands are entirely unwarranted. ,

“My deepest regret is that the students, whom we most wish
to serve, will ultimately suffer.”

would be added to the 200 remaining from 1 »

the original 1500.

To Vrana, ordering any more would
have been taking a grave ﬁnancial risk be-
cause of insufficient demand. ‘He was obvi-
ously, and justifiably so, keeping a close
watch on ﬁnances because of the Univers-
ity'§ ﬁnancial status. .

But his fear was unjustiﬁed and possi-
bly stemmed from his alienation from the
workings of the Directory sales’. Both days

the Directories were sold out in all loca-

tions. People were being turned away.

Besides evident student demand at the
Student Union-and Towers sales areas, the
committee had not had a chance to sell at
( 1) the Medical Center Nurses’ Residence,
(2) Engineering Hall, (3) evening classes,
and (4) all University departments.

Urbaitis also checked the cost of print-
ing additional copies. The printer agreed to
supply 500 more for $225 and every 500
thereafter for $75. He also agreed to have
the order ready for Monday. -

If Vrana would have taken these, facts,
and projected a supply-demand curve, he
may not have made such an unrealistic de-
cision. Perhaps an economics 80 would help
enlighten his financial outlook.

If Vrana wants to fulfill his rightful
duty of keeping a close watch on ﬁnances,
let him do so in a more professional man-
ner. Let him use all facts and establish a
procedure of empirical analysis.

Urbaitis’ efforts reﬂect an ‘attempt to.
cooperate in a responsible manner with the
administration on a student-oriented pro-
ject. He neither advocated total student
control nor abolition of the administration.

He presented his case with facts and
was unjustifiably rebuked. Unless his sta-
tistics were completely distorted, his recom-
mendation should have been accepted. It
wasn't. The result is not only denial of an
adequate supply of directories, but the evi-
dence of the outdated Vrana View of admin-
istrative omnipotence.

  Honorary Engineering Degree  

    

  

 

1..

Awarded to Dr. G. R. Fitterer -

Dr. G. R. Fitterer, director
of the Thermodynamics Cen-
ter at the University, will be
awarded an honorary doctor
of engineering degree bythe
universal Tecnica Federico Maria
in ‘Valparaiso, Chile, Friday.

The honor will be conferred in
recognition of Dr. Fitterer’s help
in establishing a graduate school
for the Chilean Institution, and
his successful efforts in securing
ﬁnancial help for it from the
Agency for International Devel-
opment (AID). Santa Maria, a
privately endowed, engineering
college, is now considered one of
the most advanced science-ori-
ented schools in Latin America.

Dr. Fitterer, who was dean of
the Schools of Engineering and
Mines before‘ accepting his post
with the Thermodynnamics Cen-

ter, spent much of his time de-
veloping doctoral programs in
chemical, electrical,iand mechan-
ical engineering at Santa Maria
as part of the AID program.
Each year, two or three Univer-
sity professors have participated
in the development of these ad-
vanced courses in Chile, where
they have formed the nucleus of
the graduate faculties. At the
same time, Santa Maria Univer-
sity professors have taken ad-
vanced work towards their own
doctorates at ﬁve universities in
the US. , _
Currently-, eight Santa Maria
professors are in the US, and sev-

eral have already returned to.

Chile with advanced degrees.
During the past two years, stu-
dents from two other Latin
American countries, Equador and
Argentina, have turned to Santa

Maria for their postgraduate
studies. Santa Maria established
the ﬁrst doctoral_ program in Lat-
in America.

Dr. Fitter-er has directed the
graduate programs at Santa Ma-
ria since their inception, and his
participation in the graduation
ceremony‘ will mark his seventh
trip to Latin America. His pre-
vious trips concerned not ‘only
Santa Maria, but such other int-
erests and economic cooperation
between Latin America under the
auspicies of ‘the United Nations.

Dr. Fitterer had also been hon-
ored by the late President Ken-
nedy, who appointed him to the
White House Committee for En-
gineering Education. Shortly af-
terwards, the University gave
him a chair as Distinguished Pro-'
fessor of Metallurgical Engineer-
mg.

“For instance," he said, “we
include all the information on
how many nights girls are allow-
ed to be aw.ay from the various
schools. Then, if a prospective
date mournfully tells you she
has used up all her overnights,
you will know if you are really
being shafted.”

The girls schools were apa-
thetic to the guide. A girl at
Mount Holyoke said, “It shows
the Princeton boys are behind
the times, sort of antique.”

Another Mount Holyoke girl
said Princeton boys “wear coats
and ties .and button-down collars.
They’re sort of gentlemen, or
pseudo-gentlemen, and very
stuﬁy.”

Princeton boys talk about them-
selves, gin, and girls, and want
to be Yalies.

A Bryn Mawr girl said, “A
Princeton boy will take you out
and spend money on you, but
won't recognize that you’re there
except in a physical sense." '

Being Frank

Sports Editor

  

POWER OF THE PRESS

A 1-4 team receives little notice around the country. In
fact the East receives little mention because of the poor
record the Big Five and the rest of the eastern teams have
amassed so far this season.

The talent is sparse in the East, but the Panthers have
three ball players who, through their play in the last ﬁve
games have shown that they are of All-East caliber and are
candidates for All-American.

The ﬁrst is Eric Crabtree. He has had ﬁve fantastic
games and every team has had to change there kickoff tech-
niques because they know he can run one back if it is kicked
to him. . A

West Virginia made the mistake of kicking the ball to
him once too often and he ran’ one back 92 yards. In the
Duke game the-Blue Devils decided to kick the ball for an
onside kick and give the Panthers the ball—near mid-ﬁeld
rather than lea Crabtree return the -ball. Navy did the same

. Navy did the same thing. They didn't use the tee .wh‘en,
they kicked off and the Panther deep receivers were stand-
ing on the twenty yard line. Bob Dyer took one kickoff and
pitched -it back to Crabtree, after all the tacklers went
toward Dyer. Crabtree might have gone ‘all the way if he
had gotten a better block.

As a. receiver Crabtree has caught 24_passes for 460

yards. It was obvious to those who watched the Duke game .
on national television how many extra yards Crabtree usual-
ly gets after he catches the pass. It always takes more than
one man to bring him down when he has, any room to man-
euver. . .
Crabtree has made the All-East team twice already this
season. If he has a good day in New York in two weeks and
if he has a good day on the west coast he has an excellent
chance to be‘ named to many of the All-American teams.

In New York he will share the limelight with Lloyd
Little andin Southern California he willbe matched against
the great Mike Garrett’. Nick Eddy from Notre Dame is
also a strong candidate for an All-American team. The Pan-
thers play some of the vbestteams‘ in the country and this .
accentuates the greatness of Crabtree’s performances so far.

The two other players the Panthers have who rate a
nod from the experts are Josh Novograntz and Jim Flanni-
gan. Novogratz was-. the best guard on the offensive team
last year. This season he is the best linebacker on the de-
fensive team. -

Novogratz started out as a right corner linebacker, but
was moved when the opposition found gaping holes up the
mid-dle. He has played two games as the middle linebacker
and has excelled in both. In the Duke game he madefour-
teen tackls and six assists. In the Navy game he started the
game by throwing the Navy quarterback for a big loss. He
calls the defensive signals and has been one half of the grid-
ders two excellent linebackers.

, Jim Flannigan has been impressive since he switched
from. second string offensive fullback to first string left
linebacker. In the Oregon and Oklahoma games he and
Novogratz were the equals of the highly tauted duo from
Oregon, Dave Tobey and ‘Tim Casey, and of pre-season All-
American Carl McAdams, from Oklahoma. ’

Flannigan specializes in using sheer power when bring- ‘
ing down a ball carrier. In the Oregon game he tackled both
Dennis Keller and his blocker. In the West Virginia game,
Garrett Ford was running behind three blockers and Flan- ‘
nigan cross body blocked all three of them down and still
slowed down the ball carrier so he could be tackled.

-He was kicked in the head on that play and din’t re-
member another thing about the 7weekend. He played the

The only way a 1-4 team can have anyone be an All-
American is to have a good game in New York. Three. years
ago Jim Irwin, a third team guard, played only a. few pl-ays
in a game against Army in Yankee Stadium. He played well
and even though’ he only played for a few minutes he made
all-East. « . I’

The power of the New York press isn’t to be under esti-

mated and if these three play well the honors will be certain.

If Miami got a chance to
see ﬁlms of last week’s Pan-
ther-Navy game it will be a
good bet that quarterback
Kenny Lucas can expect to-
see a lot more blitzing in to-
morrow’s game, at the stadium,
starting at 1:30 p.m.

Against the Middies, Lucas was
thrown for losses totaling 87
yards while trying to pass. The

Navy linebackers had little trou- ‘

ble out-manuvering the offensive
guards and with them out of the
way it isn’t that tough to cha_se
down Lucas.

“One of the reasons for the in-
efficient blocking last week w.as
the absence of left guard Tom
"Crosby, who was injured,” said
John Michelosen. Replacing him
was a sophomore Dick Miale,
who had never played the posi-
tion before. Michelosen expects
to have Crosby back in the line-
up tomorrow. , .

The offensive unit’s greate
problem is most likely to come
from Miami’s defensive end Ed
Weisacosky and not the center
of the line.»

Coach Steve Petro, who has
scouted Miami, has seen Weia-
cosky do a lot of blitzing. “It's
always’ said that you put your
best football players on defense,”
said Petro. “In this case it might
be true.” In the 24-0__'Hurricane
upset of Syracuse earlier this sea-
son, the All-America candidate
made 18 tackles. ‘C _

Miami coach Charlie Tate, calls
Weisacosky “the greatest defen-
sive player I have rum into in
my years as coach. If he isn’t an
All-America football player, then
no one is.” _

Despite Weisacosky’s creden-

nthers  

G

STEVE PETRO

Scouted Miami
tials, Petro credits 21 5’10’’, 175
pound safetyman, Andy Sixkiller,
as the spark plug of the Hurri-
cane defense. “He’s never satis-
ﬁed just being on his own side,”
said Petro. « -

In last year’s 20-20 tie with
Miami, Sixkiller returned‘ a punt
71 yards for a touchdown, pulled
in a 19 yard pass on a fake p_unt
formatiQD.. made eight tackles
and intercepted one pass.

Part of the reason for the rug-
ged Hurrican squad is the fact
that 18 of their players come
from right around Pittsburgh.
Only 13 come from Florida. Weis-

acosky is the son of a Pennsyl-

vania coal miner.

“They’re just like a bunch of
ants, moving all the time,” said
Petro. “Nobody will ever outﬁght
them.”

Quarterbacking their scramb-
ling attack is sophomore Bill Mill-
er. “He's a cool, smart quarter-
back, who refuses to be rushed,”
evaluated Petro. Miller stepped

Ohioan’s . Top Scorer Sam Robert
Opposes Soccer Team Tomorrows

By GEORGE LIES
Tomorrow the soccer team

‘meets its equal when they play
Ohio University at Athens, Ohio.
His name is Sam Roberts.
Roberts, a sophomore‘ from
Monrovia, Liberia, leadslthe Ohio
U. team in scoring with nine
goals and one assist in- five
games. In the same number of

. contests, the record of coach Leo

Bemis’ booters shows ten goals
and three assists. And Dave Shaf-
fer, the leading scorer of the soc-
cer team, merits three of those
points, two goals and one assist.

Since the season began, scor-
ing goals ‘hasn’t come too easy
for the ‘booters. And this week,
as every, Bemis worked on this
weakness in practices.

“Against Ohio, we’re going to

_ try working our forw/ards more

on a direct frontal attack. We’re
going to loop the ball down the
side of the ﬁeld and then kick it
across,’’, Bemis said..

“Ohio has scored more goals
than us, but- our team, settling
down now after a few injuries
just has to get better. In the next
ﬁve games, they'll pick up that
knack of scoring.”

Although a team must score
to win, soccer is.still .a defensive
game. Led by Darrell Kilpatrick,

    

a senior lettermen from Warsaw,
the Ohio Bobcats give almost
nothing to their opponents, al-
lowing four goals in their ﬁrst
ﬁve games.

«Except for the loss to West
Chester, 4-1, the booters .also
show little charity to the opposi-
tion, giving just three other goals.
“To win these last games, we
must maintain our tough de-
fense,” said Bemis. _

At the defensive fullback posi-
tions, Bemis always puts his most
experienced players. Against the
Bobcats, the main job of Captain.

The Pansies, who won last

twice in the second period for a

12-0 halftime lead. Tom Heniff

scored the ‘ﬁrst on a ten-yard
pass from Scott Grant and‘ Bill

Delveccio caught a one-yarder.
from Gr.ant for the second. De1--

veccio scored again in the third

yards for'the ﬁnal TD. ' - ,

Terry ‘Lerman’s .15-yard’ run in
the second period gave Circle K
the early lead following a 60-
yard drive, and John Gula’s 60-
yard run in the third quarter
added insurance points.

The Commuters scored first but
had to play two overtimes before
topping the Bandits. Dave Pa.yne’s
three yard pass reception was
good for ‘the -first score after
Dick Kilburg had caught a 52-
