Quirky
course titles
can deceive

Mallory Grossman
Staﬁ” Writer

Forget Chemistry, American Government
and Accounting — the most memorable
college classes are sometimes about magic,
fairy tales’ and the Beatles.

Along with the usual college subjects,
Pitt, like other colleges throughout the
city, offers courses that appeal to students’
wider interests, expanding beyond the
world of calculus and into the world of
happily ever after.

Instructors and students insist that
these courses can sometimes be harder
than their names lead many believe, forc-
ing people- to rethink their deﬁnitions ‘of
“magic” and other generally light-hearted
concepts. ..

Junior Michael Yake didn’t learn about
the stereotypical form of magic when he
enrolled in Magic, Medicine and Science, a
history course, to fulﬁll a general education
requirement his freshman year.

“It was focused on what they believed
was magic back then. Not Merlin magic,
but instead how—water—turned-into-ice
magic,” Yake said. J

He also said the class “sounded interest-
ing because it involved magic, but it was a
lot, a lot, a lot of reading and more work
than I expected.”

Professor Eric Hatleback, the course’s
instructor, admitted that there was a lot
of work in the course but said that he con-

structs a system that allows students to
decide for themselves what combination of
papers, presentations, reading responses
and quizzes they will complete.

New official
to help Pitt
through
health care
reform

For The Pitt News

‘Pitt officials hired former state Secre-
tary of Health Everette James for their
newest administrative position with
the hopes that he could guide Pitt’s re-
searchers and students as the nation
experiences health care reform.
Created _by Pitt" earlier this month,
the new position of associate vice
chancellor for health policy and plan-
ning will allow James to bring a new
level of cohesiveness to the University’s

‘health resources, said Dr; Donald Burke,

dean of the Graduate School of Public
Health.

For years the University has consid-
ered adding an upper—level administra-
tive position to coordinate all of the
Pittsburgh health systems, Burke said.
Those systems include University re-
search labs, UPMC hospitals, private in-
surers and other health agencies ‘aimed
at increasing health in the city. J

James said he plans to aggressively
coordinate future research projects
at Pitt and expand on the University’s
“comparative effectiveness research.”
That type of- research compares treat-
ments and drugs used to combat some
of the most resistant and expensive
diseases, with the aim of streamlining
treatment options and making them
more effective.

“I don’t think the title deceives students
into thinking the .course is about magic,
because we deﬁnitely cover historic mate-
rial that could be said to deal with magic,”
Hatleback said.

Other courses also address the momen-
tous idea of magic. Among them is Rus-
sian Fairy Tales, routinely one of the most
popular classes on campus. Often taken by
students to fulﬁll the International/For-
eign Culture — Regional and Non—Western
Culture general education requirement,
the class covers a variety of Russian and
Western fairy tales along with provocative
approaches to studying the stories.

The course has students watch the Dis—
ney movies “Cinderella” and “Snow White,”
but also involves a psychological approach
to the tales and analyzes the beliefs inform-
ing the magical world of the narratives,
said professor Robert Metil, the course
instructor.

This course includes cinematic, artistic
and musical representations of the super-
natural ﬁgures and scenes from the tales.
If then compares the Russian fairy tales
with Western fairy tale traditions of the
Brothers Grimm, Perrault and Disney. The
class typically has between 200 and 350
students.

“For instance, if someone comes to a
doctor with lower back pain, there ex-
ists a number of different types of ways
to treat this. We need to compare the
effectiveness of these treatments and
choose the best,” James said.

Additionally, James will present Uni-
versity research to UPMC officials, with
whom he will work to develop and test
new models of health care. .

His duties will also extend into the
classroom. In the spring, James will
teach a course, “Health Reform in the
U.S. — Past, Present, and Future,” that
will provide students with an oppor-
tunity to explore the development of
health reform over the past so years.

“Instead of getting information from
the news, students will be able hear
about the new health reform law from
someone who went to law school,”James
said.

The class will be James’ ﬁrst expe-
rience as an instructor in the college
classroom.

“I am really looking forward to doing
some teaching,” James said. “The chang-
es around the new health care create an
exciting opportunity for students in the
schools of health sciences to advance
care in a whole new environment.”

President Barack Obama’s Affordable
Care Act brought the need for coordina-
tion to the forefront, Burke said. The
new position will focus on three areas:
research, UPMC program development
and teaching.

Burke said that James’ deep experi-
ence in public health policy will be a
major asset to the University during
these times of recession and health care

.“James is bringing a level of practi-

have. It is the dream of every academic
to have the results of their research

. make a positive difference in peoples’

lives,” Burke said. “We hopeJames helps
us to be effective in having an impact
on health in Allegheny County and
throughout the state.”

During his time with Gov. Ed Ren-
dell’s administration, James helped
implement the 2008 statewide smok-
ing ban. He also helped establish physi-
cal education and nutrition standards,
for both public and private schools in
Pennsylvania, which are currently under
examination by state regulators and are
scheduled to take effect next year.

When the Obama administration
passed the health care reform law in
March 2010, James worked on a num-
ber of the reform’s early implementa-
tions. .

As part of Rendell’s administration,
James set up a “high-risk” insurance
pool for the neediest citizens that were
denied insurance coverage for at least
six months. The state offered them a
health insurance policy provided by the
governmentto bridge the gap between
now and 2014, when the health care
reform will go into full effect.

“We rewrote the laws around claims
and appeals for the insurance compa-
nies to make sure consumers have the
ability to have their appeals heard-in
a timely basis when denied coverage,”
James said.

James said that the health care re-
form law will change the landscape for

providers and administrators of the
system.

“There is going to be a much great-
er focus on primary care, nursing and
community—based care,” James said.
“Because we are going to have some 30
million new insured people as a result
of the health care reform, we are going
to have to figure out a way to do two‘
principal things — continue to improve
outcomes and control costs.”

Metil said part of the popularity might
come from the buzz about favorite parts of
the course among students such as “learn-
ing that some of the tales such as those
concerning kissing frogs and even snotty
goats were used to help young girls deal
with puberty and sexuality.”

Some students avoid courses on magic
and turn to the wide range of physical edu-
cation classes that are oﬂered.

Football Ofﬁciating, Water Aerobics,
Party Dance and Intro to Rock Climbing are
among the other nontraditional courses
offered.

Kathryn Chovanes, a sophomore who
is currently enrolled in Total Body Fusion,
thinks that these types of physical educa-
tion classes are beneﬁcial. '

“I think they give_college students mo-
tivation to work out and get graded on the
fact that they’re participating,” Chovanes
said. “And they are legitimate classes that
you can get credit for.”

Thomas Prigg, the instructor for In-
tro to Rock Climbing, said that he likes to
keep a light class and joke around while
teaching students the necessary skills for
top roping. .

Although there are no tests involved in
the course, Prigg said that he drills stu-

dents enough that he knows which stu-
dents know what they are doing.

Carnegie Mellon also takes part in ex-
panding students’ horizons beyond what
many college students expect.

The Beatles — a course at CMU that
focuses on the phenomenon of the 1960s
musical sensation — involves studying
the bands’ songs and analyzing the mu-
sical and lyrical content and structural
elements of them. .

The course tries to ﬁnd out what ex-
actly caused Beatlemania and studies the
music’s social context, according to CMU’s
course catalog.

If students are not feeling the music
world, CMU offers Introduction to Hot
Glass, where no glassblowing experience

is required.

In this class, students learn safety,
proper tool use, communication and a
team approach to glassblowing, while also
making clear glasscups and bowls in the
process. .

Full—time Pitt students — those enrolled
in at least 12 credits — can cross—register
for classes at CMU, as well as eight other
colleges in the city, through cross-regis-
tration, if they get the permission of the
department at the other college. ._

Atomically absent-minded

Whatever you might have thought about
the tightness of American nuclear secu-
rity, think again. According to Slate.com,
former President Bill Clinton might have
lost the top-secret nuclear codes — the
only way the United States could respond
after a nuclear attack —— for months in
1998. In a memoir published recently,
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Gen. Hugh Shelton claims the 42nd
president lost the codes on the day after
the salacious Monica Lewinsky sex scan-
dal broke. Webet that when White House
staff found out about the codes, Clinton
must have responded, “It depends on what
the meaning of the word ‘lost’ is.”

Crocs have wings

First you’re taught to look out for terror-
ists on planes, now big-toothed reptiles?
MSNBC reports that a passenger on a re-
gional ﬂight from Kinshasa, Democratic
Republic of Congo, packed a live crocodile

into a duffle bag and brought it on board.

Burly stats

Wilkinson Sword, the manufacturer be-
hind Schick razors and shaving creams,
is judging university men by their relative
amounts of scruff. According to a recently
released survey the company _conducted
with men on 60 campuses, the top three
most cleanly shaven schools are Texas
Tech, James Madison University and the

University of Virginia. Rutgers University <

is the hairiest school with Harvard and

the University of South Florida sitting just

‘ reprinted. When it comes to public safety
_ in Pittsburgh, at least we don’t have to’
_ worry about people launching themselves

above it. The University of Pittsburgh is
in the middle of the pack as the 26th most
clean—shaVen. But, that ﬁgure is mislead-
ing — as a whole, Pitt is the hairiest. To
give other schools a chance, researchers
were forced to regard Dave Wannstedt’s
mustache as an outlier.

Burning desire

Heated passion has always had a place
in sports, but perhaps you didn’t real-
ize to what extent. According to the St.
Cloud Times, a ﬁfth—grade teacher from
Statford, N.J., would rather put herself in
a burning house than risk missing a Phil-
lies game. During a house ﬁre in April, the
woman deﬁed ﬁreﬁghters and dashed into

THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID

Our response to music ingrained, not superﬁcial

After the Yo-Yo Ma concert brought her to tears, Caitlyn chose to examine how we emotionally respond to music

‘ Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

Last weekend I learned the emotional power
of music ﬁrst-hand when my roommate and
I acquired a couple of PittArts tickets to see
Yo-Yo Ma in concert. During the last of his
three encores, Ma played a rendition of “The
Swan” from The Carnival of the Animals suite
by Camille Saint-Saens. As we stood to ap-
plaud, my roommate looked over at me to
see a stream of tears coursing pathetically
down my face.

Even though the movement was gorgeous,
I wasn’t crying because I was overwhelmed
by beauty. I wasn’t really thinking about any-
thing sad either. But I’m convinced there was
something about the cello lines that triggered
something in my brain and turned into an
enormous lump in my throat. The lump be-
came tears, and within moments, I was the
crazy lady sobbing in the third row.

Despite my embarrassment, this intense
emotional reaction to classical music is ac-
tually pretty common and based upon in-
grained, intemal response patterns.

It doesn’t happen to all of us, but a 1991

study by British researchers on music struc-
ture and emotional response says that emo-

i tional responses to music grow with repeated

exposure to the same song. Crying is the most
emotional and not necessarily because a per-
son is sad.

At the concert, I recognized “The Swan”
immediately but didn’t know where it was
from. Like the c1assical—musically illiterate
person I am, I thought it might be Vivaldi. The
movement features a cello solo, which is sup-
posed to evoke a swan gliding overwater. One
or two accompanyingpianos play sixteenths
and rolled chords, which are supposed to
represent the swan’s feet beneath the water,
hidden from view but propelling the bird
along on its swim.

Since I didn’t know the title of the move-
ment, I didn’t think of any birds or animals.
I don’t even remember what I could have
thought about. As far as I know, I was just
listening and watching as Ma played with his
eyes closed and his head tilted back.

But I know I heard the suite somewhere,
from a long time ago. I was classically in-
structed on the violin for years. Unfortu-
nately, I was a brat who wasted it. I hated

practicing, I hated the pressure of one—on_-one
tutoring, I didn’t likethe kids in orchestra,
and I quit. Looking back, I still think it was
probably one of the silliest things I’ve ever
done. Today I would sell my left foot to get

any of that skill back — but honestly, I’m still .
. not willing to practice every day.
Even though I neglected my musical

education, it apparently left a mark. The
1991 study cites another article that found
emotional responses grow during repeated
exposure to music, classical or not, as the
listener discovers more subtle ‘features in
the music. Goodmusic always has something
more to express —— more than it can express
in a ﬁrst listen.

In the Harvard Gazette, William]. Cromie
explained how the brain listens to music.
Triggeredby music "notes, the inner ear ﬁres
electrical signals that create a conscious mu-

- sical experience in the auditory cortex. Differ-

ent patterns excite different cells, creating an
association between the sound of music and
feelings, thoughts or past experiences.

All music works this way, whether rock ’n’
roll or a concerto, and culture and experience
play a large role in the way we perceive it.

But what occurred to me as I was sitting in
Heinz Hall sobbing was that, in this case, my
thoughts didn’t have much to do with it.

Instead, I think that music was touching
on something more primal than emotional
state. After all, whales make music too. Patri-
cia Gray, the head of the Biomusic program at
the National Academy of the Sciences, says in
a study that human music actually has a lot in
common with whale music, even though our
evolutionary paths haverft intersected for 60
million years. Gray suggests that, somehow,
music predates humans.

So perhaps I cried for a combination of
reasons: prior exposure to the song, musical
appreciation and stimulation of my auditory

cortex. But no matter the reasons behind my . _

sobbing ﬁt, I’m.glad I got to have it.

Even though I was embarrassed, even
though I kept my bloodshot eyes lowered as
I scuttled out of the auditorium and to the
waiting school bus, I am happy to’ think that
I touched on something ancient, something
that predates me or Ma or even Saint-Saens.
Yo-Yo would have been so proud.

Memorize this

Don’t underestimate the value of rote memorization in class

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
Columnist

There really isn’t a “best” way to teach stu-
dents. But in great teaching, there are es-
sential components whose importance we

shouldn’t disregard. Even with all of the nega— '

tive press it gets, rote memorization is still
one of those components. '

Most of us have probably taken a fair num-
ber of courses during our college careers." But
have we considered what kind of education
we are getting, and if it is the best learning
methodology in use? When I say education, I
mean taking courses for simplicity’s sake.

In my time at Pitt I have come to realize
that almost any course can be categorized by
one of two realms: information or intuition.
However, there are some courses that will
be hybrids of these. ‘

It is likely you have taken both types of
courses. Information courses are largely and»
sometimes solely based on seemingly endless
information you must memorize and thenbe

’ able to recall accurately come time for exami-

nations. These courses exist everywhere; it’s
not like they are only relegated to either arts
or sciences. There are information classes in
both ﬁelds.

Intuition classes are something else. They

do require you to know a basic amount of in- '

formation — minimal memorization, really.
But the real weight is in being able to synthe-

size and derive answers given a premise. This .

type of course really assesses your thinking

orization classes nowadays.

Not so long ago, the U.S. education system
operated differently. Recall our collective
image of brick schoolhouses that were clev-
erly labeled “Schoolhouse,” with troops of
students chanting aloud multiplication tables
at the whim of the teacher. Those students
were educated folks, but today, society and I
quickly judge that methodology as inferior to
the more recent, intuition-based education I
was just romanticizing.

However, we shouldn’t get lost in the false
belief that any one educational method is the"
ﬁnal answer. Because as it turns out, memo-
rization might be one of the most fundamen-
tal skills to learn. In a recent article in the
The New York Times, Daniel Willingham,
a psychology professor at the University of
Virginia, was asked about rote memorization.
“You can’t be proﬁcient at some academic
tasks without having certain knowledge he
automatic —— ‘automatic’ meaning that you.
don’t have to think about it, you just know
what to do with it.” Automatic recollection
requires methodical memorization.

An example of this necessary base of au— ’

tomatic knowledge is when you’ve tried to
learn a language. With a new alphabet and

‘an entirely new vocabulary, rote memori-

zation lends itself as an eflicient tool. An-
other example is in medical school, where
problem-based learning is central, medical
students ‘still must learn human anatomy with

. the same memorization skills they acquired

with schoolhouse training.
In an article in The Chronicle of Higher
Education, the author, Mark Bauerlein, claims

We shouldn’t get lost in the false L
belief that any one educational

ability. That is not to say information courses
are relaxed, but rather, they exercise a differ-
ent set of mental faculties.

I understand I have been quite vague in
describing these courses and their qualities.
To see if you agree, and if you can differenti-
ate these two realms, think back to questions
you’ve been asked on examinations. Infor-

' mation classes will ask you to state facts as

deﬁned in class. Conversely, intuition classes

. will ask you to hypothesize, deduce and en-
. gage in in-depth critical thinking.

Whereas there might be more than enough
bushes to “beat around” on Pitt’s campus, _I’ll
instead be frank and admit my own prefer-
ence: I like intuition classes. But then again,
I could just be passively following the trend

in sentiment about lear11ing. It seems many

public ﬁgures and academics downplay mem-

that “memory is a muscle  the more you
exercise it, the stronger it gets.” As such, it is
no surprise that courses in college, where it
seems we would have abandoned schoolhouse
techniques by now, still encourage some level
of rote memorization. It’s something we will
always need.

So to myselfand others, before we consid-
er intuition the sole path to become educated .
folk, we must appreciate the virtue in the
fundamentals, that is, in memorization.

Next time you are asked to memorize a
sonnet, a list of electromagnetic equations
or the names of every nerve unfortunately
known to mankind, know you are exercising '
a truly important skill. This skill will come in
handy in any class, intuition or not.

as a Public School Official”

$7 cover/ $5 with written letter to an
elected official expressing concern about

‘ budget cuts in the public school system

These days, the world might rely on smart
phones and social networking, but that
doesn’t mean typewriters are out of style.
Just ask poetry group the Typewriter-
Girls.

Crystal Hoffman and Margaret Bashaar,
the two women who compose the Type-
writerGirls, call themselves “purveyors of
knowledge” to the world outside of their
close—knit poetry cabarets. Now they’ve de-
cided to center their knowledge on a fraught
institution: the public school system.

The TypewriterGir1s was originally a
group of ﬁve young women who met during
their sophomore year at Carlow University
in 2004 in the creative writing department.
There, they had a quirky professor who
gave them each a typewriter as a present.
From then on, they were known by their
present name. ' M

Soon, however, Hoffman and Bashaar
were the only two who wanted to continue
the group.

‘ Together, they created a new sort of
poetry reading: one ﬁlled with philosophy
—— sometimes their own — and inspired by
surrealism and Dadaism, an anti—war and
anti-bourgeois cultural movement founded
in Zurich during World War‘I. This new kind
of creative atmosphere became the poetry
cabaret.

What exactly is a poetry cabaret? The 4

term comes from the arts cabarets in Eu-
rope. “It’s essentially whatever we want
to do there,” Hoffman said.‘ In addition to
co-conducting the poetry readings, Hoff-

man also writes a new and original comedy
sketch that overarches the entire show.

“[It’s] almost like a large play,” Bashaar
said.

Calling their new show “TypewriterGirls:
Portrait of the Dadaist as a Public School
Ofﬁcial,” the women aim to illuminate the
recent budget cuts to education and arts
programs in public schools.

Bashaar said she began to pay attention
to the public school system when her 5-year-
old son entered kindergarten this year. He
is a lively and creative child, she said, and it
was an interesting integration to watch.

But now the women are aware of the
problems that face public school systems
—— problems that extend beyond budget

cuts. Hoffman feels that many teachers are

becoming “gloriﬁed babysitters.” Bashaar
added that she doesn’t think teachers are
doing enough, that they aren’t coming up
with creative ways to help students and

Halloween parties are a dime a dozen in a
large city like Pittsburgh. The North Side’s
New Hazlett Theater will throw its own twist
into the holiday festivities by bringing in
burlesque and dance troupes for it theatrical
extravaganza. ‘

On Friday night, the theater will have a
plethora of eye—cat_ching performance groups
and a- free raffle at its dramatic party.

The theme of the beneﬁt comes from a
classic French theatrical performance called
“Le Theatre du Grand-Guignol,” which trans-
lates to “The Theatre of the Big Puppet.” In

.1897, Grand Guignol events were known for

their naturalistic horror, and since then, the

. term has earned the connotations associ-

ated with graphic and amoral entertainment.
What could be a better backdrop for a Hal-
loween bash at a theater? '
“The original plan was to base the event
on a Brazil Carnival, theme, but at the ﬁrst

planning meeting, someone brought up “Le ’

Theatre du Grand-Guignol.” Although almost
no one was familiar with the term, we were
all extremely interested and, after doing re-
search, were excited to go with it since it was

. so unique,” said Debra Sciranka, a marketing

associate for the New Hazlett Theater.

The fundraising event will help the the-
ater continue to give unique shows a place
to play. To repay each attendee for his or her
contribution, the theater enters everyone
at the event into a free raffle in which the
winner and a guest will be able to attend
any event at the theater for an entire year.

parents alike. _

In addition to their Dadaism—themed
drinking games, comedy, poetry and magic
— all in support of public education e the
TypewriterGirls will, according to Hoffman,
“start [their] own alternative school” as
part of the show.

Bashaar added thatin their school, they
refuse to have a “myopic, single—minded
view about how things should be‘done.’7

Along with the TypewriterGirls’-perfor-
mances, the show plans to include addition-
al performances by other artists, including
poetry readings by Lynn Emanuel, a profes-
sor of English at Pitt, and private readings
from the renowned poetry advocacy group
Poetry Brothel from New York City. '

Hoffman adds that she’s looking forward
to how all of the acts interact as a combina-
tion‘ of very nontraditional and somewhat
risque pieces of performance art. _

Both women stressed thatthis isn’t just
any poetryireading, and tliatjasl Bashaar
teased, “sometimes, the audience becomes
unwillingly a part of the show.” Although
they wouldn’t say exactly what this shiow’s

audience involvement would entail, past _'
performances have included games and

impromptu dance parties.

The TypewriterGirls have a passion for
these types of performances. “Every act,
every thing we bring in is like our baby,”
Bashaar said. For their upcoming show, it
looks like that baby is heading to school. , _

Groups add distincttraits

Bridge City Bombshells promise ‘zombie—l_esque’ performance

Macabre 4 6

There is also a thrilling group of performers

- who will bring their distinctive talents to the

party to entertain the crowd.
One ofthe groups gracing the New Ha-
zlett’s stage for the fundraiser is a burlesque

troupe calledthe Bridge City Bombshells. _

It was purely by chance that the group was
able to be a part of the Grand Guignol event.
One of the member’s hairdressers works for
the New Hazlett, told the client about the
beneﬁt, and a promising work. relationship
was born. ‘

Elizabeth Couteau founded the group

. in July of 2009 and has led it ever since.

She was inspired by a friend who headed a

' similar troupe in New Orleans. She sought
training and then used her new talents to‘

create the Bridge City Bombshells in Pitts-
burgh. The group performs to live music
and prerecorded tracks, but their acts are
characterized by the unique costumes and
makeup that the ladies put on.

“Our forte is unique burlesque: rock ’n’
roll, zombie-lesque,” Couteau said.

Performing with the Bridge City Bomb-
shells during the Halloween season is very
special for Couteau. Her favorite part of the
holiday is bringing characters to life and she

ﬁnds burlesque the perfect vehicle.

V Also on the bill at the fundraiser is a lo-
cal dance group called Evolve Productions.
Director/choreographer Sarah Parker was
able to combine. her Point Park degrees in
Dance Performance and Education and Busi-
ness Management and Marketing when she
founded Evolve in 2008.

Parker, who has danced since age 4, no— i

ticed the wealth of talent in dance and the
arts that existed in the greater Pittsburgh

, area and the need for a group to synthesize

all different types of dance into a unique rep-
ertoire. The group’s debut performance was
in January 2009 and was entitled “Break-'
out.”

“I don’t think that there is._anything
typical about our performances. We try to
bring styles‘ together that don’t normally go
together.’We focus not only on the artistic
aspect of dance but also the physical and
entertainment parts,’_’ Parker said.

Parker also feels that the costumes and
characters truly make Halloween what it is.
She enjoys being up on stage and putting on
an act for an audience, but she loves it even
more when everyone can join in on the fun
of dressing up. _" ' '

Blue-Gold rosters unveiled, dunk contest tonight

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

The stage is set for tonight’s slam dunk
contest between four Pitt men’s basketball
players following the Blue- Gold Scrimmage.
You’re probably familiar with some of the
contestants, but you might not know the
“newer additions to the team. The Pitt News
takes an in—depth look at the contestants.

Tale of the Tape

Gil Brown: Senior Forward
':»&-leight: 6’6”
Weight: 215

Brown is known as the high ﬂyer of the team.

With a long list of impressive dunks during
his time in a Panther uniform, the best just
might have come last season when he pos-
terized Cincinnati’s Steve Toyloy and simul-
taneously drew a foul. Brown, who said his
vertical leap was listed at 38 inches in high
school and has probably improved since,
looks like the favorite on paper right now.
“I got a lot of tricks in my bag. I can’t give it
away,” he said.

Nasir Robinson: Junior Forward
Height: 6’5”
weight: 220

Though he’s not a big dunker in games, don’t
count out Robinson as a serious contender
for the title. He's an athletic player who might

surprise a lot of people with his leaping abil-
ity. “I’m going to show people I can jump,”
he said. “I’m going to pull a trick out of my
sleeve. .I’m going to save it for later.”

JJ. Moore: Freshman Forward
Height: 6’6”
Weight: 200

This freshman’s athleticism might not be
very well known on campus right now, but it
soon will be. The team is certainly aware of
it -— guard Travon Woodall referred to him as
“jumpingjack” Moore.Just search You'I‘ube
to see the kind of dunks he can perform.
One of his most recent dunks made its way

and Brown. “Me and Gil had our little dunk

contest —— that was just something to show
people that we’re ready for our competition in
the Big East,” Moore said. He said his vertical
leap is around 38 inches and that his favorite
dunk is abetween—the—legs move, so look out
for that. “I think we’re going to have a good
showing,” he said.

Cameron Wright: Freshman Guard
Height: 6’4” I
Weight: zoo

Another freshman, Wright is a player with I

serious hops and highlight-reel dunks all over
YouTube. While a fairly unknown commod-
ity on campus right now, Wright has all the
potential to win and can challenge the other
three for the team’s slam dunk title. ]

FOOTBALL . A ‘

Panthers to face an emotional Rutgers team

Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writer

When the Panthers take the ﬁeld against»:
the Rutgers Scarlet Knights tomorrow,
they will look to build on momentum they
established last week.

’ Fans saw a promising change in the Pan-
thers’ play against Syracuse last Saturday
that deviated from their disappointing
nonconference performance. It seemed
they finally put together four solid quarters
of Panther football.

_ Pitt (3-3, 1-0 Big East) unleashed an
aerial attack against the Orange, as quar-
terback Tino Sunseri had his best game of

’ ~ the season. He threw for 266 yards, four"
touchdownsand no interceptions. "

“There are a number of guys that contin-

. ue to make progress, like Tino._He’s making
good decisions, but the most encourag-
ing thing to me is that he’s protecting the
football,” head coach Dave Wannstedt said.
“When you can come out of the game and
not have any turnovers, we’re going to have

, a chance to win every week.’’ i
" ‘ ..  M  , .. “The most encouraging thing other than

the win was to see some players step up
into roles that we’ve been counting on,”
he said. 7

One of those players is Pitt running
back Ray Graham, a New Jersey native,
who will see his brother, Khaseem Greene,
in Saturday’s game. Greene is a starting
free safety for the Scarlet Knights.

“That’ll be interesting,” Rutgers head
coach Greg Schiano said. “I’m sure it will
be a little weird, but once you start play-

. ing, it’s football.” .

Last year, Pitt defeated Rutgers 24-17 in
Piscataway, NJ. But this year, Wannstedt
said the Panthers face alvery different
opponent. ' _

“On offense, they’re a spread team,
they throw the ball around the ﬁeld, and
they run the Wildcat. They have a pres-
sure defense,” he said. “They do a lot of
movement up front, and they’re very good

on special teams. This will be different '
V forus, and we’ll have to pick our game up

another notch.”

The Scarlet Knights (4-2, 1-1 Big East)
boast a 27-24 score over fellow conference
member Connecticut. Last week, the team
took Army into overtime, ultimately win-
ning 23-20.

Despite the win, Rutgers faced a d_is-
heartening incident in the Army game.
junior Eric LeGrand suffered a C3-C4 spi-
nal cord injury and is currently paralyzed

V in the hospital after having undergone

emergency surgery.

But the teamis forced to move on, fo-
cusing on the matchup that Pitt will pres-
ent tomorrow. , l

UPMC seeks smokers aged i8~66 who are already
planning to quit smoking to participate in 3 Quest
research study on the shorttenn effects at the oral '
medications on smoking heharior, craving, and mood. .
One is FDA4approved iorsrnoking cessation, Zyhan
(oupropion), and the other is Fhikapproveo tor waketul
pass. Provtgil (modatinii). This is not_ a treatment study.

You will he asked to take study medication that may
or may not_ccntaio the active components. Research
study participants who complete the entire study
will receive $845.

 

“I think now what’s happened is that
[Pitt’s] offense has really found their
stride,” Schiano said. “Their defense has
played very well, and they have gotten
better and better as a team. I have seen
it on tape. They have two great tailbacks
and probably the best fullback in America
in [Henry] Hynoski.”

Schiano cites that a major problem

' plaguing the Scarlet Knights this season

is discipline and mentalitoughness in rela-

- tion to penalties.

. “I’m sick about it. We’ve got to do some-
thing to get it corrected. Some of it is we’re
inexperienced in some positions and we’re
jumpy. We had six illegal procedure penal-
ties. That’s just being jumpy, and we need

_to get that calmed down,” Schiano said.

Additionally, he expressed concerns
about the strength of the offensive line

protecting the quarterback. If Pitt blitzes, ’

this could present a major dilemma for the
Scarlet Knights. ‘.

Rutgers’ quarterback Chas Dodd, a
freshman, has thrown ﬁve touchdowns
and 755 total yards so far this season after
taking over for Tom Savage. The team has
a versatile wide receiver in sophomore
Mohamed Sanu. He has six touchdowns
on the seasonand is a target for both re-
ceiving and rushing the football. The team
sometimes uses him out of the Wildcat
formation.

Running backjoe Martinek is an effec-
tive runner out of the backfield and has
two touchdowns on the season.

Wannstedt was also quick to give the
Scarlet Knights credit. He cites Rutgers’
defense as second-best in the Big East with
only West Virginia aheadof it. '

“Nobody will force the blitzing issue
as much as Rutgers Will. If you look at
their team, three of their winsjcame in the
fourth quarter with their defense making
big plays and turnovers, giving them the

. opportunity to win,” he said. “We need to

focus on protecting the ball, and this will
be a 60-minute game.” I

Although this study is not a treatment trial, everyone
who completes the study will he offered optional hrlet
counseling and Zyban (uuprepinn) at on cost after the
study is over to help them not permanently. '
