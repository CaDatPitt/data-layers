Also agrees to provide additional laboratory space for scientists and doctors

Nic Pedicino

For The Pitt News

UPMC Health System
pledged in excess of $1 billion to
the University of Pittsburgh yester-
day, solidifying the partnership
between the two organizations.

The 10-year agreement
involves UPMC building a new
research facility that will provide
laboratory space for University
physicians and scientists. I

From 1985 to 1995, the
University’s share of funds award-
ed by the National Institutes of
Health grew more rapidly than any
other American university’s. The
new research space should allow

Pitt’s faculty to compete for even
more federal research frmds.

The funds will directly sup-
port clinical programming and will
include a substantial discretionary
frmd overseen by Dr. Arthur
Levine, ’Pitt’s new senior vice
chancellor for health sciences and
clean of the medical school.

“Taken together, these steps
will provide a- stable funding
stream of our health science
schools; sustain and enhance the
University’s medical and biomed-
ical research; and enhance the abil-
ity of Pitt and the UPMC Health
System to attract and retain out-
standing clinicians, teachers and
researchers,” said Chancellor Mark

Nordenberg.

UPMC Health System presi-
dent Jeffrey Romoff said he
believes the survival of the
research and educational mission
of the schools of the health sci-
ences depends on the support of
the clinical operations of the
UPMC Health System. He said the
schools of the health sciences are
“at the heart” of the UPMC.

‘Their internationally recog-
nized research and clinical pro-
grams distinguish the UPMC
Health System from all others,”
Romoﬂ° said

The University and UPMC
share an existing management
contract that Romotf estimates has

terms thereafter.

The new research facility is
still in the planning stages, accord-
ing to Nordenberg. Its future loca-
tion is unknown.

already provided $1 billion over
the past 10 years. The new agree-
ment allows for broader terms,
new people in new positions, and a
reafﬁnnation of the two orgar1iza—
tions’ relationship. .
The formalization of the exist-
ing partnership will require the _
University to elect one—third of ’
both the health system directors 
and the executive committee. 9
The new agreement will be in
effect for a period of 10 years,
with two-year renewable

 

    
 
 
 
  
 
 

Ridge allocates money to help Pitt,
other schools combat drinking

FILE

Governor Tom Ridge recently allocated
$560,000 for Alcohol Awareness pro-
grams at Pennsylvania's public schools.

Pitt workers OK contract,
but many still unhappy

Lisa Grzyboski

Staff Wrlter

A drrmken mob rocked the State College
area July 12. The rioters, many of whom were
Penn State students, ripped down lamp posts
and smashed windows in the glare of huge
bonﬁres burning in the middle of streets.

Over a month later, Governor Tom Ridge
visited State College to armounce that the
state would give $560,000 to help curb
underage and binge drinking on college carn-
puses.

Saying irresponsible drinking is not just a
Penn State problem, nor solely a collegiate
problem, Ridge called it “a cultural problem,
a community problem and an American prob-
lem.”r

As part of the state’s efforts, Pitt will
soon receive $25,000 to promote alcohol
awareness among students, said a spokesmen
for the Pemrsylvania State Police. '

The money will go toward creating a
“campus community partnership program,”
which will create coalitions involving stu-
dents, faculty, university administrators, com-
munity and business leaders, and even stores
holding liquor licenses, in an attempt to com-
bat the problem of binge drinking on college
campuses.

Pitt is one of nine schools intended to
share the money.

Alcohol education and enforcement
grants will also be given to Penn State

Contrlbutlng Edltor

After a year—and-a-half of negotia-
tions and protests, Pitt’s maintenance
workers agreed last week to a new
contract. .

But Billy Joe Jordan, president of
Service Employees International
Union Local 29 — the union that Pitt’s
maintenance workers belong to — said
some workers are still dissatisﬁed

“Some of /them are very mad at it,”
said Jordan. 1 “They felt that we
should’ve pushed for a better deal, and
that we should’ve gone on strike in
order to get it.”

The workers were frustrated with
the wait, Jordan said .

E “Some members were tired of the
whole issue,” he said “The contract

was put before them, and they felt that s

it had gone on’ long enough.” .
The University administration an
the Union came to an agreement, and it
was brought before and passed by the
Union membership, according to Pitt
spokesman Ken Service. “Several
weeks ago a tentative agreement was
reached. On Aug. 26, we received
word that the workers’ contract had
been ratiﬁed by the Union members.”
The three-year contract covers the
period oflan. 1, 1997 through Dec. 31,

1999. During that period, Pitt’s mainte-

nance workers will receive a retroac-
tive three percent increase over their
1997 pay, a two-and-a-half percent
increase over wages 1998 and 1999,
and $200 compensation for never
receiving a pay increase during the
early part of 1997.

The contract also includes extend-
ed medical beneﬁts provided by the
Pittsburgh Building Owners Welfare
Fund through Highmark Blue Cross

- and Blue Shield, at the suggestion of

the union.

“It’s much cheaper and much bet-
ter than the one Pitt was offering,” said
Jordan.

Since negotiations for a new con-
tract began Jan. 1, 1997, the day after
the previous contract expired, SEIU-
29 had demanded a four-percent
increase in its next contract.

Jordan said many SEIU-29 mem-
bers were concerned that if they settled
for less than they were demanding,
they wouldn’t have to remain in the
contract for a long period of time. Then
on Jan. 1, 2000 they could begin nego-
tiations for a new contract and only be
locked in the present one for another
16 months. 7

“Wesettledonthatdatesothatwe
could get a chance to negotiate a better
contract sooner,” said Jordan. “This

way they would not be stuck in this -

Student's death prompts desire
for tornado warning system

Vanderbilt ‘Hustler

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (U —WIRE) —As
soon as she accepted her son’s posthumous
degree last May, Debbie Slepicka returned
to her home in Memphis and started work
on developing a tornado warning system
for the city of Nashville.

Her son, Kevin Longinotti, died May 4
as a result of injuries suﬁered after being
trapped under a tree during the April 16 tor-
nado that hit Centennial Park. -

The graduating senior, who was par1ic- _

ipating in an Army ROTC ﬁmction at the
time of the incident, had fulﬁlled all require-'
ments for degrees in education and math.
They were presented to Slepicka by
Vanderbilt Chancellor Joe B. Wyatt as part
of last spring’s commencement cere-
monies. ’

A number of anonymous ﬁnancial con-
tributions were given to Longir1ot1i’s family

to pay for things such as fimeral expenses.

or In response to those tornadoes,
Vanderbilt is in the process of creatinga
campus storm warning system to notify stu-
dents of when it is time to take shelter. The
Metro City council, though, cites ﬁnancial

constraints as the reason for turning down .

similar proposals for Nashville as a whole.
According to an article printed in the
Aug. 27 issue of The Tennessean, Mayor
Phil Bredesen recommended in a letter to
the city council that Metro’s weather radio
transmitter be replaced at arcost of $31,000.
An outdoor warning system, which would
include 87 sirens, would cost $2.8 million.
Slepicka, who has spent much of the
time since her son’s death working to con-
vince Nashville to set up such a warning
system, has ﬁled a lawsuit against the city

V claiming negligence and wrongful death '

‘They don’t want to help her,” said
Diana Rose, a senior and head resident of
Hemingway Hall. “They only see Kevin as
a statistic.”

Rose, who as a resident adviser in
Mirns hall last year became friends with
Longinotti, has maintained close contact

’ met twice so far to consider possible warn-

‘ with Slepicka throughout the summer. She 

has been working to keep the mother :
informed of developments in Nashville »
regarding proceedings on the warning sys-
tern. '
“She stayed in touch with The
Tennessean and Channel 5,” Rose said.
“She has been doing research all summer,
just pulling information.” _
Vanderbilt’s efforts to protect studen
from other meteorological dangers in ﬂte 9
future have been very good, Rose said
“Ihey have done everything at this point to
ensure the safety of the students,”‘she said. 
An internal Vanderbilt committee has '

ing systems to -notify students of dangerous 3
weather situations. Options include a cam- ‘
pus siren system as well as a telephone noti— =
ﬁcation system. M
g The committee includes Chief of Staff l
for University Relations Bill Phillips,
Director of Security Al Guyet, campus and
medical center security ofﬁcers, and repre-
sentatives ﬁom news and public aﬁairs. '
“You learn ﬁom such an incident,” ‘
Phillips said in regard to the fonning of the 
committee following the April events. “The l
department works in responding to needs.” :
_ The Oﬂice of Housing and Residential 1
Education has" also been involved in ensur- j
ing that both students and residents know =
proper procedures for safety and evacuation f
during a tornado. , 1 .
Rose said that Slepicka, who had been j
worried by reports that many students had ,
not been evacuated ﬁom rooms during the ‘
tornado, is now satisﬁed by. the university’s =
attempts to alert students to dangerous T
weather conditions. '
Weather radios have been distributed to
various locations throughout campus, in 1
addition to one already located in the office M
of Associate Dean of Housing Steven _’
Caldwell. . V _ - 9
“We have maintained in the office for
some time a weather radio, and we thought
it should be in the hands of our staff,” ‘

Pizza was voted the “Best Pizza
Chain" in America” for the second
consecutive year. .
Restaurants and Institutions gave
the popular pizza chain the honor in
its “Choice in-Chains” survey of
more than 2,800 consumers across

_ the -United States.

In addition to being named best

overall pizza chain in the survey

results, Papa John’s placed first in

Papa John’s led the survey ahead
of the other national pizza compa-
nies, including Pizza Hut, the largest
pizza chain in the world.

The Restaurants and Institutions
results are consistent with the “Best
Pizza” awards won by Papa John’s
during the last few years in more than
50 individual markets across the
country. The taste test results,
showed that
among consumers who expressed a

better contract, we would’ve tried to

For the time it took to get the con-
tract ﬁnalized, many workers are
relieved, Jordan said. There are, how-
ever, a sizeable number of people who

sign one that was not up their original
demands.

“It’s up to the people to stand up
and ﬁght for a better contract,” said
Jordan. “They have a tendency to
blame the leader and the administra-
tion when things don’t go right and the
members don’t get what they demand-
ed. But at the end of the day, it’s up to

ing if they so choose, he said.

“Our goal is not to eliminate under-
age drinking; our goal is to eliminate the
bad things that happen because of it,” said
Hickes, citing environmental and societal .
views on alcohol consumption as factors;
that need to change. ',

Robert Gallagher, vice chancellor ofi

Pitt will also have the option of 
requesting support ﬁ'om the State Police’s ‘
Bureau of Liquor to curb underage drink- “

student affairs, said he was happy to hear

Pitt was getting $25,000, but said it was i
not realistic to think the money would;
make a huge dent in the problem. T

“I think it’s an important step that the &
state is taking because binge drinking is a l
major problem across the nation,”
Gallagher said. “However, everyone
knows that money and grants have not
reduced the problem signiﬁcantly.”

Tom Charles, deputy press secretary
for the governor, said Ridge realizes that
no amount of money will solve the prob-
lem. However, he said the governor is
hoping the funding will act as “seed
money” to “promote partnerships that
ﬂourish long after the money is gone.”

Gallagher said alcohol awareness is

nothing new to Pitt, pointing to the alco-
hol advisory committee the University
has had for the past three years. He
chaired the University’s ﬁrst alcohol task 7
force — the group that led to Pitt’s current
advisory committee that made countless
recommendations to administrators con-

cerning alcohol on campus. Designating ,

Towers A and B as dry dorms came out of 1
those recommendations, he said. . 
Gallagher feels that with the added

thrust coming from the state, Pitt may be 3

able to make more headway with busi- l

nesses holding liquor licences around the
campus.

, “It’s not an easy problem and there’s
no easy solution,” Gallagher said.

He was supposed to meet with
Hickes at the end of the month to discuss
ways to best implement the program. Pitt
will also sign a letter of agreement with
the state in order to access thefunds;

After the initial meeting, and_ once i
Pitt is comfortable with the plan, addition- Q
al people from the Pennsylvania Liquor ‘
Control Board and the state police will be
brought in for support, Hickes said.

The basis of the campus community 1
partnership programs is to let students
know that a memorable college experi-
ence does not have to include drinking, 1
said Pmkh' am. i

“We at the liquor control board have
found that students are not getting to col-
lege and learning this behavior,” she said.
“It is home-grown. We have many kids
developing a taste for alcohol as early as
12 years old. When they go to college it
just reinforces the habit.” ' J

South Africa's spending
I needs to ‘be prioritized

Carnegie Mellon recently

announced that South Africa, over

the next five years, plans to fund
50 percent of a new $20 million
telescope.

But such a commitment to this
non—essentia1 project seems fool-
ish, considering South Africa is in
a severe depression. (In May, The
Economist called South Africa the
second—worst performing economy
in the emerging markets.)

Dennis Brutus, a professor in
Pitt’s department of Africana stud-
ies and former political prisoner
on Robben Island, said in a letter
to The Pitt News: “As a South
African, I must express opposition

to such a huge commitment by ,

South Africa at a time when there
is a desperate need for housing and
for better health and educational
services. I would urge that South
Africa’s contribution (which, ‘ in
any case, would include land and
services) should be significantly
reduced.”

While science, astronomy and
physics are important, they should
not come at the expense of desper-
ately needed social welfare.
Though $10 million may not be a
significant amount in a country’s
budget (with the value of the South
African rand dropping approxi-
mately 25 percent since January,

each dollar costs the South African
government more), it is $10 mil-
lion that could be put to better use.
. Public universities suffered a
40-percent slash in their budgets at
the beginning of the year, with pri-
mary and secondary schools hav-
ing to face rising numbers of stu-
dents and diminishing funds.
Crime is still a significant fac-
tor in South African life, . with
Johannesburg having one of the

highest murder rates in the world.‘

Mass murders and a virtual state of
martial law in the Richmond area
are examples of how vio_lence in
rural KwaZulu-Natal is spiralling
out of control.

Health care is in a state of dis-
array. The quality of ‘care is
falling, and there is a shortage of
qualiﬁed doctors and a lack of
funds. V

South-Africa, slowly emerging
from a troubled past and vast eco-
nomic disparity between blacks
and whites, should not be spending
money — even amounts which do
not signiﬁcantly dent the budget
— on nonessential projects that
could just as easily be funded by
private corporations and institu-
tions. » 1
' For the sake of social welfare,
the South African government
needs to set its priorities straight.

In. the corporations‘ secret service

For the past two centuries or so, the elites
who rim the world have had to maintain at least
the pretense of consulting the public before
going about their real business of making prof-
its. But in recent years, even this consolation
prize of the exploited has come under attack In
the United States, this trend was evidenced by
the “fast track” bill of last autumn, which would
have allowed the president to push through new
trade agreements with minimal input from the
population. '

Unfortrmately for business, the bill itself
became a subject of public debate and was
defeated after environmental groups, unions and
other democratic forces mobilized to kill it.
Business is determined to avoid a repeat of this
scenario, especially when it comes to measures
thatcorporate leaders ﬁnd “too important”tobe
left to the public. Barring expanded executive
power to ram through unpopular measures
favorable to transnational capital, the next best
thing for business is near—perfect silence about
such measures. That is why many

readers of this column probably JOHN
LACNY

have never even heard of the
Multilateral Agreement on
lnvestrnent (MAI). V

Since 1995, the MAI has been
negotiating behind closed doors in the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), an exclusive club made
up of the world’s 29 wealthiest countries.
Initially, MAI negotiations were to be carried
out under the auspices of the World Trade
Organization, but Third World countries in that
body strongly opposed the general thrust of the
treaty. It is easy to see why: The heart of the
MAI is a provision stating that foreign investors
must be given treatment at least as favorable ‘as
domestic investors. In other words, national
development policies will become impossible,
because Third World governments will be.
unable to foster. the growth of domestic industry
in the face of overwhelming competition from
corporations based in the wealthy countries.
Because the Third World was understandably
expressing its distaste at becoming even further
beholden to the ﬁnancial and industrial irrstitu—
tions of the “developed” world, MAI negotia-
tions have since moved to the OECD so that the
rich boys can work things out between them-
selves. After negotiations are completed, the
poor countries are to be given the “option” of
either signing on to the MAI or being excluded
ﬁorn the markets of the rich.

Not surprisingly, the Third World is not the
only area of the world that will lose out as a

result of the MAI. Corporate power. will be
strengthened everywhere, making things
tougher on the enviromnent and on working
people. Among other things, the MAI bans per-
formance requirements such as policies favoring
companies that use the best enviromnental prac-
tices or laws against companies that deal with
despotic regimes, and does not even allow gov-

ernments to require that a corporation hire local _ p

people. To enforce provisions like these, the
agreement sets up “arbitral tribunals” composed
of unelected “experts” who will have the ﬁnal
say in disputes between corporations and gov-
ernments — a measure that effectively gives
corporations the power to sue governments in
international courts -to overturn laws they ﬁnd
harmful to their proﬁts. _

' Those who deny that such a scenario can
occur had best explain the case of the Ethyl
Corporation, which has sued the Canadian gov-

ernment for $251 million in damages under the

provisions of the North American Free Trade
Agreement. The reason? Canada
has effectively‘ harmed MM'I‘, a
gasoline additive produced exclu-
sively by the Eﬂryl Corporation.
MM'I‘ is widely recognized as a
toxic substance and has been
barmed in several U.S. states as well.

The only way the MAI is going to register
on the media radar and in the public conscious-
ness is through a grass-roots campaign begin-
ning right now. The political group Public
Citizen is asking people to write to their state
attorneys general advocating that their states be
declared “lVIAI-free zones.” (Pemrsylvania’s
attomey general, by the way, is Mike Fisher, and
his address is l6tl1 Floor, Strawberry Square,
Harrisburg, PA 17120.) Incidentally, if the MAI
issue ever becomes visible, we are likely to
encounter the idea that the debate is between
“interrrationalists” on the one hand and “protec-
tionists” on the other. But this cheap neoliberal
card trick, which is devoid of even the slightest
hint of substance, ought to be seen through
immediately, especially when one considers that

in February more than 600 organizations from‘

68 countries wrote a letter to the OECD oppos-
ing the MAL

The campaign against this monstrous cor-
porate power grab is the campaign of the true
interrrationalists, because it is the common peo-

ple, and not the powerlirl, who truly have a _

world to win.

John Iucny thinks that the  “IMF” prob-
ably stand for more things than one.

I know what you did at Thee Dollhouse last summer

Gerald Bergen

columnist
The question “What did you do over

the summer?” often oornes up in casual con- '

versation around this time of year. For most
of us, the answers range from construction
to secretarial work to internships to just
hanging around and watching cartoons (at
least for the most shiftless of us college
types). a

And what did your ﬁiendly neighbor-
hoodeolumnist do during the summer? I
worked for my father, manufacturing
Frberglas ductwork for air conditioning sys-

tems _and renovating rental properties. ,

y However, if anyone were to ask what I
did last year, I would tell them truthfully I
was a ﬂoor host at Thee Dollhouse of

Philadelphia, a gentleman's cabaret, aka a
“nudie joint.” -

What is a ﬂoor host? Quite simply, a
combination of bouncer, salesman, pit boss
and general all-around lackey. The phrase

that most aptly describes our demeanor is 2

“an iron ﬁst in a velvet glove.” .

Two of my brothers (ages 23 and 20)
also worked there. While the younger one
became a ﬂoor host like myself, the older
was originally the “light and sound” man,
then became a part—time general manager.
As the saying goes, it’s best to keep-it in the
family.

If I close my eyes, I can imagine the
expressions of -people silenﬂy- processing

 information. For sorrre reason, I can see . .

men silently cheering and women shaking
 heads wondering what kind of psy-

chopaths write for The Pitt News.

It’s a common reaction When I men-
tion my former place of employment, peo-
ple look at me in a whole new light. They
can’t imagine such a culttned, soft-spoken,
erudite man of the world (cough, cough)
working in a place where men shoved $20
bills into a woman’s garter belts.

But I did However, I did not work in as

sex parlor that sold pornographic videos,
magazines or “marital aids.” Nor did I work
in an establishment that had a “back room.”

Also, none of the women performed
any unnatural acts involving mammals or
reptiles, nor did they wrestle in Jell-O or

___pasta as the movie “Striptease” would have

the general public believe. (Though it was
my esteemed honor to meet unnatural act

Fringe beneﬁts.) -

But the biggest misconception many
people have is that most of the women who
work in adult cabarets are “vapidly stupid.”
It has been my experience that the majority
of women who are “exotic dancers” are

. intelligent and rational. Some of them use

the money they make to ﬁnance college
educations. ‘

Vlfrth the amount some dancers take
home in one night, they could pay for a year
of college in a few months, with money left
over for a car, rent, taxes, clothing and a
stockpile of G—st1ings.

It’s not exactly the most progressive of
professions, but you do get to be your own
boss.AndImeanthatliterally:Alldancers

that worked at Thee Dollhouse were legally _

independent contractors, which brings new

meaning to the phrase “Let me see yourW- ‘

2.”

The reading ‘public may be wondering
what, for the most part, does the inside of a
gentleman's cabaret look like?

Imagine taking a Barbie condominium
play set and ripping off everything but the
ﬁrst ﬂoor. Then paint the inside black, and
line the room with strobe lights, a sound sys-
tem, neon tubing and black lights. Install a
small stage with a mirrored wall and a brass
pole, and a bar with several miniature TVs
playing ESPN. ‘ .

Throw in a few Barbies in thongs, sev-
eral bustier-clad Skippers serving drinks,
and about thirty Kens sitting at small club
tables smiling their plastic smiles and drink-
ing their plastic beers.

Oh, and a few G.I. Joes in tuxedo shirts

and vests watching the parking lot ﬁlled ‘

with Barbie Corvettes, making damn sure
Ken doesn't get drunk and unruly.

Now to the question on most minds:
Yes, I have seen women’s breasts. Many
breasts. Breasts in all diﬂerent shapes and
sizes. Ifl were a composer, I’d write music
to go with the following lyrics: “Big
ones/Small ones/Roly-poly fake ones...”

For those with a Y chromosome who
were employed by‘ Thee Dollhouse, work
was not a source of (pardon the pun) con-

stanttitillation.Imustadmitﬂ3atwhenIﬁrst'

started, watching naked women dance was

interesting. But as time passed and job bore- .

dom set in, they all became nothing more
than moving wallpaper —- which is a good
indication that men are not the slobbering
wolﬂrounds some paint them to be.

In a analysis, it was the most inter-
esting summerjob I ever had The pay was
all right, the fringe beneﬁts were excellent
(no wisecracks) and the staff parties were
phenomenal. (Think open bar.) It was a
high-energy environment where Aqua’s
“Barbie Girl” is being blasted into your ears
while working 10-hour shifts until 3 am.
just to get up at 7 the next morning. But it
shall.always have a fond place in my heart.

The orie  1
Pitt-Nova  
rivalry

Did youknow Pitt has never lost a
football game to Vrllanova? Never.

Pitt is a ﬂawless 1-0 against the
Wildcats. T‘hat’s .a perfect winning per-
centage. The one big win was a brutal 12-
O shutout in November 1911.

That kind of momentum can go a long
way. The Wildcats know they’ve never
beaten us. Every time they’ve come onto
our home ﬁeld, it’s been the same thing.
We shut them down, slaughter them, and
send them back across the state with their
tails between their legs and the realization
that they are really not that “Wild.”

No doubt Vrllanova Head Coach
Andy Talley has studied the old Pitt-
Vrllanova game ﬁlms all week. The late
nights in the ﬁlm room probably turned
into early mornings as he meticulously
searched the old footage, trying to ﬁnd
some ﬂaw in the Pitt game plan.

Pitt, on the other hand, holds the
advantage of history. There’s that little

_ mental edge, that little conﬁdence boost of

knowing you’ve beaten them before, so
you can beat them again.

Some things have changed since
November of ‘ll. For one thing, players
now wear helmets when they play foot-
ball.

Another difference is that'Joseph H.
Thompson, Pitt’s head coach in that his-

» toric battle, is dead. In fact, 19 other Pitt

head coaches have come and gone.

‘Nova has also gone through some
changes since that last gridiron battle. It
dropped football in 1981, only to add it
again in 1985, this time at the Division I-
AA'level.

The game situation is also a little bit
different. The 1998 installment is the ﬁrst
time in this series’ storied history that the
game is both teams’ season opener.

Like every team in America on open-
ing weekend, optimism is high for both
squads. The players aren’t too beaten-up
yet, and team morale isn’t down from any
losses earlier in the season.

But in good old 1911, the game was in
the heart of the season. It was Pitt’s sixth
contest of the year and the ﬁfth for the
Wildcats. The Panthers, coming off an
undefeated 1910 season, started strong
with two crushing wins, a 23-0 romping of
Westminster and a 22-0 ﬂattening of Ohio
Northern. _

Then everything started to fall apart. A
shocking 17-0 loss to Carlisle foiled the
team’s hope of an undefeated season, and
then an ugly 9-3 loss at Cornell continued
the team’s slide.

Pill hoops   gets first verbal

' 0vertlreSummer-

Judging from what was said about the
Pitt basketball team over the summer,

- p things are looking _up thisseason after three

losing seasons in the past four years.

In late July, senior guard ‘Vonteego
Cummings was named one of 25 candi-
dates for the John Wooden Award, the
highest individual honor given to a college
basketball player. This announcement fol-
lowed two straight seasons in which
Cummings was named an All-Big-East

performer.

In mid-August, The Courts, an
Internet publication dealing with basket-
ball (http://members.t:ripod.com/~jdt-
warhawk/domain.html), chose Pitt as its
preseason No. 31 team and Cummings as a

preseason second-team All-American.

A few days later, ESPN basketball
junkie Jay Bilas also chose Cummings as a
preseason second-team All-American.

First Recruit

Pitt received its ﬁrst verbal commit-
ment for the 1999-2000 season ﬁ'om Jamal
Brown, according to ’I'hursday’s edition of
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Brown is a 6-foot-6-inch forward who
lead Baltimore’s Dunbar High School to a
USA Today top-25 ﬁnish in the newspa-
per’s ﬁnal high school rankings this past
season. He averaged more than 20 points
and 6.1 blocks per game as a junior last
season. This year he’ll play at Pittsﬁeld
Maine Institute.

A verbal commitment is not binding.
A player cannot oﬂicially commit to a col-
lege team until the oﬂicial signing period
in November of his senior year in high
school. '

Looking to the Season -

Some fans will look at Pitt’s out—of-
conference schedule this coming season
and say the Panthers have an easy sched-
ule.

against . Maryland-Baltimore County,

,Wright State and Howard, they would be

right.

A more attentive fan will notice, how-
ever, Pitt’s tough Big East schedule and the
Puerto Rico Shootout. ‘

The Shootout is an annual eight-team
tournament in Puerto Rico over
Thanksgiving weekend‘. Teams participat-
ing this year include Maryland, Kentucky,
Xavier and UCLA, all preseason top-10
teams. Pitt faces Xavier in the ﬁrst round.

Pitt’s Big East schedule is no cake-
walk, either. The Panthers face top-5
Connecticut twice, top-25 Syracuse once,
and top-25 St. John’s twice.

Recruiting Rumors

(Note: The NCAA prohibits Pitt
coaches from commenting on the following
recruiting rumors.)

Pitt is being linked to a myriad of play-
ers in the recruiting wars for the 1999-2000
season.

For starters, Pitt is currently consid-
ered one of two or three schools leading the
competition for the D.C.-area’s DeMarr
Johnson. Johnson is considered a top-5
recruit by everyone. He’s a 6-9 small for-
ward who has the skills to play every posi-
tion, including point guard. Johnson has
wowed just about everyone there is to
wow, and he considered skipping his
senior year of high school to head for the
NBA.

‘ But ever since the three high school
players who entered the 1998 NBA draft

were selected later than expected, Johnson ‘

has considered more seriously going to
college before the NBA. Other teams
reportedly in the hunt for Johnson’s ser-
vices are Georgia Tech and Michigan.

Another top recruit linked with Pitt is
top-25 combo guard Kenny Saterﬁeld. A
combo guard is a player who combines tra-
ditional point guard skills (passing, good
dribbling) with traditional shooting guard
skills (shooting, height).

Saterﬁeld’s list of schools he’s inter-

ested in has changed considerably in the
past three months. Originally, he was
thought to be headed to the Big East or
Atlantic Coast conferences; then many
said he’d narrowed his choices to Texas
and the ACC’s North Carolina State. Now
the Big East is in the lead again, with Pitt‘
and Connecticut supposedly leading.
Considering how many shooting guards
Connecticut is recruiting this year, Pitt has
a very good chance of landing Saterﬁeld.
' In August, I heard an unconﬁrmed
rumor that Pitt offered a scholarship to
New Jersey big man Rodney White. White
is a versatile forward who has gained inter-
est ﬁom Kansas, Seton Hall and Florida as
well.

Women's soccer
drops first game

The women’s soccer team didn’t ease into
its season, they got into the thick of it right
away, playing national powerhouse Penn State,
one of the toughest opponents on.its schedule,
in the ﬁrst game. ,

The Lady Panthers, in just their third sea-
son of play, dropped the contest to the Nittany

when Penn State’s Shari Pickett scored.

Penn State followed with two more goals
in the next four minutes, the ﬁrst by Megan
McKeown and the second by Carole Duichka,
to leave the score 3-0 at halftime.

Penn State’s V Bonnie Young nailed the
Lions’ fourth goal of the game at the 48:40
mark, before Pitt got on the board

Sophomore forward Mia Mora knocked in
the Panthers’ only goal at the 53:31 mark
Junior midﬁelder Megan Beasly had the assist

The Nittany Lions managed one more
goal, this one by Kelly Convey, to close up the
scoring. '

defending national champions found
themselves needing a victory over Notre
Dame in week ﬁve to bump themselves
back to a winning record.

But instead of a win, the game ended
in a make-out—with-your-sister 0-0 tie.

While Pitt was stomaching the ups
and downs of the 1911 season, across the
state, Vrllanova just sucked. The Wildcats
lost their ﬁrst three games against
Princeton, Penn and Penn State by a com-
bined score of 91-0 before pulling out a 0-
0 tie against Marquette to solidify their
record at 0-3-1 heading into Pittsburgh.

So the matchup was slated. The slid-

. ing Panthers desperately needed a win to
keep their hopes of a winning season alive,‘

and desperate Vrllanova just needed a win.
In 1911 we found out which school

I was better, just as we will Saturday. Our

Panther defense kept V1llanova’s year-
long scoreless streak alive, preserving the
12-0 win.

I’m sure you’re itching to ﬁnd out
what happened during the rest of the 1911
season. Pitt followed its win over
Vrllanova with another 12-0 win over
Washington and Jefferson before dropping
a tough 3-0 contest against Penn State in
the season ﬁnale to ﬁnish with a
respectable _ but disappointing 4-3-1
record. -

Vrllanova, on the other hand, just con
tinued its atrocious season. The team went
winless but ﬁnally managed to put points
on the board in its last game, an 11-6 loss
to Washington and J eﬁerson.

The 1998 game should have the same
outcome as the 1911 battle, but look for
Pitt to put up a hell of a lot more than 12
points.

The reason Vrllanova is on Pitt’s
schedule for the ﬁrst time in 87 years is
that Athletics Director Steve Pederson
wisely decided to soften Pitt’s nonconfer—
ence schedule. '

0 Many of football’s powerhouses play
softies early in the season to pad their

records. Some people complain, but if Pitt 9

hadn’t played Southwestern Louisiana in
the opener last year, we probably wouldn’t
have gone to the Liberty Bowl, and there
weren't many Pitt fans complaining about
spending New Year’s Eve in Memphis.

Be careful, though. While Pitt should
romp Vrllanova, the Wildcats aren’t a total
pushover. They’re a respectable progam,
their players do get scholarships, and heck,
they were 12-1 last year.

But Division I-AA is a far cry from ‘
Division I—A, and the Panthers should

come out on top.

When the teams take the ﬁeld on
Saturday, you can bet that burning memo-
ry of the 1911 battle will boil the blood of
both teams enough to rekindle the compet-
itive ﬂames. . '
