The Pitt News rates the subs that students eat

ByChristine Hanna

News Editor

Cheap, quick and a lot of vari-
ety. Buy a whole one, eat half
for lunch and save the other half
for supper. Yep, I’m talking
about submarine sandwiches.

Last week, staff members of
Ybe Pitt News taste—tested Italian
subs from around Oakland to
see who makes the best.

Twelve staffers entered the
room, napkins and checklists in
hand, to taste eight different
subs. They were ready to get
down to some serious eating.

“Let the testing begin,” copy
reader Diana Zurnstein said.

The tasting of the subs, identi-
fied only by number, began and
comments quickly filled the oil-
stained checklists.

The majority of the staffers

were oohing and aahing over
each bite, especially sub Number
Six.

Assistant News Editor Beth
Kovaly and Ad Graphics
Assistant Karen Pankuch, a test-
ing duo, said number six was
the “best one.” Their reasoning
—— “awesome dressing” and
“good ham taste.”

Former sports writer Stephen
Liss was amazed with Number
Six. “The best one by far,” he
said. “Warm bread and good
fillers. What a treat!”

Copy Editor Jennifer
Spagnuolo also said that it was
great. “Good sauce and enough
of everything,” she added.

Copy reader Sheri Eshelman
agreed with Spagnuolo about
the sauce. “Good sauce, great
taste!” she said.

did not pick Number Six as his

Investigation discovers what lurks in students’ refrigerators

By Robin Senor
For The Pitt News

For those of you who thought you
received a prank phone call last week,
here they are — the results of the survey
that asked the question, “What do you
have in your refrigerator?”

One hundred on—campus residents
were surveyed. Three residents said they
did not have a refrigerator. Six said they
did not have anything in their refrigera-
tors. The remainder? —— Refrigerators
that housed everything from fresh fruits
and Vegetables to last year’s leftovers.

Okay -— so some students only had
ice cubes and pop. Not much more can
be crammed into one of those little two-
footers. Most residents had compact
refrigerators. A few in suites were lucky
enough to have a full-size one.

Some students took full advantage of
their refrigerators.

“We’Ve got everything in there. We
don’t throw anything away,” said Harry
Psaros, a sophomore living in
Brackenridge Hall.

A student in the Towers said she
keeps a supply of fresh fruits and Veg-
etables in her refrigerator.

“I always have a something to make a

Uncle Sam's
the favorite
eating place
for students

By Suzann Gries
Staﬂ‘ Writer

The majority of Pitt students
asked to choose their favorite
restaurants in Oakland chose
Uncle Sam’s Submarines over
everything else.

“The taste is good, there is a
good Variety and you get a lot
for what you are paying,”
sophomore Julie Harrison said.

Uncle Sam himself, said he
was “thrilled to death” to learn
the news.

“You know, you work hard to
make things good and when
you get a nod of approval from
the people who come in to eat
here, it’s really great,” he said.

Uncle Sam said he thinks part
of the restaurant’s appeal is the
cheerful atmosphere, but “no
matter how much people like
you, the bottom line is: Is the
food good?”

The Original Hot Dog was
also a favorite among some stu-
dents.

Beth Hoobler, a junior, said
the reason she likes The “O” is
because of the reasonable
prices.

“I like the french fries a lot
and the pizza,” Hoobler said.
“Money is a factor, though.”

Other restaurants that were
considered favorites were Miami
Subs, Hong Kong Express, CJ.
Barney’s, Hemingway’s,
Sbarro’s. Schwartz’s Bagels,
Sito’s and Pizza Hut.

Mara Biancucci, a junior, said
Herningway’s is her favorite
because “it’s a nice break from
the fast food in Oakland.” L

Ten percent of students I
polled said they did not have a l

salad with,” said the Towers‘ student,
who wished to remain anonymous.

Others used their refrigerators as little
more than extra storage space. One stu-
dent had only an empty jug in his refrig-
erator.

"I mean to fill it, I just haven't gotten
around to stealing anything from the
cafeteria,” said another student, who
also preferred to remain anonymous.

A few refrigerators had nothing in
them except water, soda or beer. Kevin
Docherty, a senior, is a prime example.

“I never have much in my fridge —— I
usually only keep juice, and beer when
I need it — it’s almost always empty.”

Other students made the choice not to
empty the refrigerators until food
evolved into a life form that could have
toldthem to throw it away itself.

One student said that he just threw
away a hoagie that had been in there
since the beginning of last semester.

“We have leftover Thanksgiving
turkey. By the way, 25 percent of the
food in our refrigerator is moldy,” Doug
Dean, a Brackenridge resident, said.

Mold was a popular inhabitant of
quite a few refrigerators. It actually came
quite close to making the top 10 list.

The survey also showed that students

Students too hungry to clip coupons or search out deals

Byjennifer N. Spagnuolo
and Diana C. Zumstein
The Pitt News

As the Beatles used to say,
“The best things in life are
free,” but sometimes the best
thing in life is just a good deal.
You know — two for one,
using coupons, saving money.

So we took a walk in
Oakland looking for some of
the best deals on meals.
Talking to restaurant employ-
ees and checking out menus
put us on track to some of the
places Pitt students might find
a good deal on breakfast,
lunch, dinner or dessert.

Burger joints usually have
some sort of promotion, so we
hit Roy Rogers. The latest deal
there is’ one-quarter of a roast-
ed chicken with corn bread for
$2.49. McDonald’s, old faithful,

has its usual Extra Value Meals,
which are four different types
of sandwich combos that each
include a large french fry and a
medium drink_. The meals cost
between $2.99 and $3.29.

If you’re more in the mood
for a sit—down kind of meal,
you could try Pamela’s.
Different specials for both
lunch and dinner are featured
every day, such as grilled
chicken salad with roll and
butter and choice of dressing
for just $4.50 or the meatloaf
sandwich with soup for $3.95.
Pame1a’s also serves breakfast
and the weekday special is two
eggs, a side of meat, hotcakes
and coffee or tea for $4.95;

For dinner, or lunch, students
can head over to the “O” ‘for a
spaghetti dinner with salad and
bread for just $2.50. The “O” «
also offers a breaded vegetable

boat with fries for $2.80.

Sbarro also has pasta with its
all—you-can—eat bar that
includes salad and garlic roll.
Free refills on soft drinks are
offered all the time — and
that’s always a plus for the caf-
feine we all need to keep us
going.

“It’s a nice clean place to
eat,” said Chris Weaver, a
Sbarro employee. “People
leave you alone.”

Tijuana Taco has vegetarian
chili for 99 Cents. Hard shell
tacos are 69 cents a piece, and
a six-pack of tacos is $3.99.
Although employee Tim
Whitehair could not tell us of
any timely deals he did boast,
“But we have real cheddar
cheese.”

‘Bagels seem to be the latest
craze in Oakland, so we had to
check it out. Bruegger’s Bagel
Bakery is offering one free
bagel with cream cheese with
any purchase on a coupon and
will be having a very interest-
ing special next month.
Bruegger’s, a countrywide

chain, is having its 10th birth-
day in February and will be
offering three. bagels for three
hours for three days to
whomever wishes them Happy
Birthday. So get ready to sing
for your supper!

Schwartz’s also has coupons
— you know, the famous four
bagels for a buck (come on,
you know you all use them),
and there is the new one that
gets you three free bagels
when you buy a dozen. And if
you buy a sandwich you can
get a free medium drink, with
a coupon. ‘

For dessert Kunst Bakery has
assorted cookies at three
dozen for $4.20. Dave and
Andy’s, for warmer weather,
has a coupon deal for two -
buy one ice cream or sundae
and get the second at half
price.

Knowing where the deals are
just isn’t enough, we had to
see if the deals were the prime
motivators for students. We
asked students, “When you eat

its food?”

“It depends, but usually the
best deal,” first-year student
Brian Greppi said.

“What I’m hungry for,”
senior Julie Knapp said. “I
spend way too much money
on food.” Maybe she should
choose a place more for the
deals.

Sophomore Norman Arent
thought long and hard and
decided that he eats what he’s
in the mood for, but, “If the
price is too high I will not pur-
chase it.”

First-year student Walt
Masilunas said, “It depends
how much money I have that
week.”

Judy Nalitz, a senior who
only eats out once or twice a
week, said that she chooses a
place “by price.”

Price seems to be the most
important factor here, but stu-
dents just aren’t searching out
the deals. We must conclude
that there aren’t enough
coupon clippers here at Pitt.

Thai your shoes and bead to Sbaa’ysz'a’e

By Chris Diersen
and Brett Gilman
The Pitt News

The Thai Place on Bellefonte Avenue, off of
Walnut Street in Shadyside may just be the most
interesting dining experience you’ll ever have in the
city of Pittsburgh. While it may be a little off the
beaten path for some students, the effort you put
forth in getting there will be greatly rewarded.

If you’ve never had Thai before, almost every-
thing on the menu will be new to you. But don't
worry, if our experience was representative, every
item on the menu should be a safe bet and a treat
for yotu‘ palate.

Mention must first be made of atmosphere. You’ll
love it. It’s both romantic and utilitarian at the same
time. If you’re taking that special someone out for a
meal to remember, don’t pass the Thai Place by.
When you go, you must order the Thai Iced Tea.
Enough cannot be said in praise of this sweet drink.
We guarantee you’ve never tasted any drink quite
so unique or downright tasty as this blend of teas
from Thailand.

The real tough choices start when it comes time
to order dinner. We tasted four, each better than
the one before it. Phad Tai is a delectable noodle
dish with shrimp and ground peanuts. The seafood
platter is a must for all who enjoy seafood. It con-
tains a little bit of everything and just enough to
make the dish quite pleasing. Also right on track
was the chicken with basil leaves and the spicy
chicken, although the spicy chicken is for die-hard
curry fans only. We’re sure you’re experience will
be satisfying and enjoyable, and dinner for two will
set you back only around $15 to $30, a little more
with drinks.

Speaking of die-hard curry fans, for the best
Indian food in Oakland —-_ or for that matter all of
Pittsburgh — we recommend Darbar on Centre
Avenue, in North Oakland. Having tried several
Indian restaurants in the Oakland area, the only
one we found worthy of mention was this one.

We ordered two dishes, lamb saag and chicken
makhani, but it took a long time to deliberate.
There was something for everyone — vegetarians
and non-vegetarians, lovers of hot food and those
with a weak tongue. Darbar features Indian cuisine
largely from the northern part of the country. And
just to warn you, the food is hot, hot, hot! "

But don’t let that scare you, since Darbar will be
more than happy to turn down the spices. Both of
the dishes we tried should be eaten with rice, nan
(unleaven bread), roti or paratha (both types of
wheat bread). j

Next we were on our airplane and off to the
Middle East. Luckily our plane had a stopover at a
restaurant on Baum Boulevard called Khalil’s ——
featuring the finest in Middle Eastern cuisine. We
heard nothing but wonderful things about this
restaurant before, but now it was our turn to expe-
rience it for ourselves.

For a college student on a limited budget, Khalil’s
is great. Not only is the food inexpensive (two peo-
ple can eat a more than satisfying meal) for as little
as $18; but for college students wanting something
a little different, Khalil’s is the place to go.

We were treated like royalty, as the- food came
out with impeccable service. Our favorite was the
lamb shish kebab, with a lamb so tender that you
could cut it with a butter knife. Also worthy of
mention are the rnedumas (walnut dip), hummus,
the grape leaves and kale and black-eyed peas.

If great tasting Chinese food is what you crave,
but your wallet is a little lighter than usual (or just
plain light), Hong Kong Express is the place for
you to satisfy your palate. It offers a giant selection
of Chinese specialty foods, and most meals are
priced at a ridiculously low $3.77, a real bargain
considering the quality and quantity of food you’ll
receive. Hong Kong Express is located on Forbes
Avenue towards Pittsburgh (near Giant Eagle).
Here, your food is prepared quickly by a friendly
staff which includes a cook straight from China
Town, N.Y.

Pizza Pizza? Yes yes
ByBethKovaly

Asst. News Editor

It’s 3 a.m. in Oakland and a friend turns to you and says, “I’m
hungry.” You are, too. You’re thinking of melted cheese, thick
crust, lots o’ sauce...

‘O’ pizza.

Need I say more?

For those Pitt students who have not experienced The Original
Hot Dog Shop $3.49 large pi’/ya ($3.70 plus tax) yet — it doesn’t
get any cheaper than this in Oakland.

If you happen to get hungry at a more reasonable hour,
Oakland has plenty of affordable spots for munching on traditional
and not-so-traditional pizza.

. Most shops offer thin— and thick—crust, round pizzas and about
15 standard toppings. For late—night eating, though, count on the

Pitt Greeks begin winter rush week in William Pitt Union

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

The Pitt Greeks kicked off a
week and a half of winter msh
activities last night in the
William Pitt Union Assembly
Room. Twenty-two fraternities
were on hand to introduce
their organizations, distribute
rush schedules and answer
questions about Greek life at
Pitt.

One of the aims of this year’s
winter rush is to combat the
trend of declining Greek enroll-
ment on campuses around the

*0 3 f0

country.

“One of the reasons for this
decrease is the fact that overall
enrollment at colleges is
decreasing,“ said Edward Ifft,
IFC external vice president co-
rush chairman. “We’re trying to
stimulate an increase by broad-
ening the membership of frater-
nities.”

According to Eric Scerbo, IFC
secretaiy and co-rush chairper-
son, fraternities are reaching
out to many types of students.

“I think it’s important that
Greek organizations reach out

Plans commence to build

Pittsfirst school of business

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

For the first time in its his-
tory, the University of
Pittsburgh may establish an
undergraduate college of
business. The decision,
which has been approved in
principle by Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor, is subject

to the approval of the
University’s Board Of
Trustees.

The College of Business
Administration, as it will be
known if approved at the
board’s annual meeting in
June, will offer Bachelor of
Science degrees in manage-
ment, finance and other busi-
ness-related fields, including
accounting, marketing and
business administration.

O’Connor’s approval came
upon the recommendation of
Pitt Provost Donald
Henderson who studied the
feasibility of the college’s
plan for more than a year.
The study began after

O’Connor asked Henderson
to champion a detailed plan
which addresses the school’s
total resources and how they
will be met.

Few details have been offi-
cially released, although the
school will be open to both
day and evening students
and the admissions’ stan-
dards would be “stringent,”
according to university offi-
cials. Basic questions such as
the availability or hiring of
teachers have not been made
available, and may not be
until the board meeting in
June.

The university does expect
to use both public and pri-
vate funds to fuel the new
college and expects the sup-
port of the western
Pennsylvania business com-
munity, which has favored
the establishment of an
undergraduate business pro-
gram at Pitt.

O’Connor said that the
school will have the potential

tionally associated with fraterni-
ties,” Scerbo said. “We are
especially concentrating on
African-Americans, Asian-
Americans and those older stu-
dents who may have worked a
few years after they finished
high school.”

In addition to extending the
rush to a diverse student popu-
lation, winter rush has a differ-
ent emphasis than fall because
of its timing.

“In the fall, most of the
rushees are first—year students
trying to figure out which one

r tonight’s

By Robin Senor
For The Pitt News

Tonight’s inauguration of
President Clinton has put
hope into the hearts of many
students.

Bewildered by the present
state of the nation, many stu-
dents are confident Clinton
will bring about the domestic
changes he promised during
the election.

“I think Clinton is going to
do everything in his power to
make his promises come
true,” senior Erik Saduska
said. “But I think he stepped
into an overturned world.
That takes priority over
national squabbles. That’s
probably the number one
issue at this point. I think

interests best,” Ifft said. “Most
of those who rush in the winter
already have a good idea of
where they want to pledge.”

Many of the students present
did seem to have their choices
narrowed down to one or two
fraternities.

“There is only one fraternity I
want to pledge, mostly because
I know some of the brothers
and it seems like a good time,”
said Michael Bell, a first-year
student at Pitt. “I want to get
involved with an organization
at Pitt, and a fraternity can
involve me in many ways.”

Ifft said that the main draw of
fraternities is their combination
of social, academic, athletic and
community activities. He noted
the large number of student
leaders on campus with Greek
affiliations.

The Pitt Greeks are intent on
erasing the myth of the Greek
stereotype.

“I’d like to stress that every-
one should give fraternities a
chance,” Ifft said. “There is a
fraternity for everyone, and it is
a great chance to get valuable
knowledge of what it’s like to
run an organization.”

inauguration in D.C.

Clinton will return to domestic
problems once the world set-
tles into stability.”

Some students said that
improvement, any improve-
ment, would be welcome.

“If Clinton does one-third of
what he said he would, I’ll be
happy,” graduate student Rose
Scanlon said.

Another student agreed. “I
think if we got any improve-
ment over the next four years,
we’d be lucky with anyone,”
Maureen Downes said.

Student Craig Wonsiewicz
said he fears that Clinton’s
focus on domestic problems
and lack of attention to inter-
national affairs could result in
problems.

“Clinton said he wasn’t wor-
ried about the trade war —-

he’s just worried about the
economy. The trade war has a
huge impact on our economy,
 he said.

But what students like most
about Clinton is his attitude.

Maureen Downes said
Clinton’s willingness to take
risks makes him admirable.

“It seems like he’s willing to
take risks. Those risks are
either going to work or they
aren’t, so I think Clinton is
either going to be one of the
best presidents we’ve had or
one of the worst. I think our
country needs change right
now so I don’t think we really
have a choice. We need to
take a risk,” she said.

Senior Karen Rosenthal said
the government will be more

Victorian women who get
caught in a time warp and
are blasted into the future."
During their journey the
women meet strange charac-
ters and are confronted by
nature’s elements and crea-
tures.

Brown said that the play,
written by Eric Overmyer, is
a dialogue-oriented produc-
tion and is “full of witty lan-
guage.”

According to Brown this is
the first play the GPSA has
sponsored. It is in response
to student requests for more
social events. “Events for
undergrads are not always
attractive for graduate stu-
dents,” Brown said. “We’re

trying to find events to
appeal to [graduate and pro-
fessionall students.”
Following the 9 p.m.
performance will be a corn-
plimentary champagne
reception. Free transportation
will be provided with buses
leaving the William Pitt
Union at 8:50 p.m. and
returning at midnight.

All earnings from the play
will be used to purchase
necessary items for the
Women’s Center and Shelter
and for Camp Sussex, an
organization that benefits
underprivileged children.
Toothpaste, women’s prod-
ucts, women’s and baby
clothes along with basket-
balls and baseballs are
among the items that will be

provided for the organiza-
tions.

Students can also bring
donations to the GPSA office
on the sixth floor of the

BUCKLEY AMENDMENT

Section 438 of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended by Section 513 of Public
Law 93-568, referred to as the “Privacy Rights of Parents and Students,” (more commonly called
the “Buckley Amendment”) requires that the University of Pittsburgh give notice to parents and
students of the following information.

The Buckley Amendment is designed to protect the privacy of students. In order to do so,
these provisions are binding on the University:

- Individual student records include only information necessary and relevant to the educa-
tional purposes of the institution.

- Student records are open for inspection by students or parents of students under 18 years of
age upon request, with the exception that letters of recommendation written prior to January 1,
1975, remain confidential. Additionally, specific documents that students have waived their right
to inspect remain conﬁdential.

- Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records.

- The institution may not release student records outside the institution without student cons-
ent, unless one of several exceptions applies.

- Requests external to the institution for information regarding students should be document-
ed, as should releases of student information.

- The University may establish categories of information known as “Directory Information”
and release this infomtation upon request by individuals external to the institution. This may be
done only after students are provided the opportunity to request exclusions from their information
being released.

Directory infonnation includes the following information:

Name

Address

Phone Number

Major Field of Study

Achievements, degrees, academic awards, or honors

Weight and height, if a member of athletic teams

Date and Place of Birth

Previous Educational Institution

Photograph

Participation in ofﬁcially recognized activities and sports

Dates of Attendance

When the Coordinator of the Student Judicial System receives a student's refusal to permit
the release of “Directory Information”, no further disclosures are made without that student's writ-
ten consent. (Except to parties who have legal access to student records without written consent.)
The refusal to permit directory information is permanent. Rescinding of this action can be done by
the student submitting the request in writing to the Coordinator of the Student Judicial System.

Further information regarding the Buckley Amendment may be obtained in 738 William Pitt
Union. If you choose not to have any of the personal information included in Directory
Information released, complete and return this form to 738 William Pitt Union by 5:00 P.M.,
January 29, 1993.

Business school needed

For students attending the University of Pittsburgh, the so-
called practical job opportunities are limited. There are
undergraduate majors in engineering, nursing, education,
accounting and chemistry. And while the economy may be
sputtering, it is largely assumed that most students majoring
in these disciplines will meet with immediate employment
opportunities.

Most students, however, are in the “other category,” major-
ing in subjects which may stimulate them intellectually but
have limited employment opportunities. To deal with this
problem the CAS/dual business program, is in the midst of
revamping its business program by offering “specialized”
majors in subjects such as marketing, accounting, finance
and human resources management. '

As it stands now, the CAS/dual business program is a
smorgasbord of classes offering courses in all aspects of
business but is not giving students any particular focus.
Along with the undergraduate business major, students in
this program are also expected to choose an undergraduate
CAS major allowing them to further develop themselves
intellectually. The College of Business Administration, as it
will be called, has been approved by Chancellor O’Connor
and is now awaiting acceptance from the Board of Trustees.
If approved this year’s freshman class will be immediately
affected by the plans.

The University of Pittsburgh is in dire need of an under-
graduate business school. It has the resources available from
the Katz Graduate School of Business, and it could go a
long way toward improving the reputation of this university.
Katz was recently voted one of the best buys in the nation
for an MBA. In terms of reputation, a Pitt undergraduate
business school could place itself among the very best:
Harvard, Wharton and Northwestern included. .

Furthermore, Pitt could reap some serious long-terrn ben-
eﬁts. Many of these students would no doubt go on to long
and successful careers, and as alumni they would become
valuable contributors to the university.

Nevertheless, the implementation of a business school
must be slow. Where is the extra classroom space going to
come from? How about the funding for it? As it stands now,
classes are filled to the point of overcrowding. Inundated by
business students needing to fill their general education
requirements, what are students in other majors going to do
who need certain classes to graduate?

Pitt will no doubt attract more students with a stellar
undergraduate business school. Are they going to raise
admission standards or accept more students? If they choose
the latter, where will the extra dorm space come from?

The decision to start an undergraduate business school is
a wise one. But the way things stand now, next year is too
quick. The current administration should act slowly and
with caution. The benefits outweigh the costs in the long
run, but if initiated immediately it could turn out to be the
other way around.

Clinton has promises to keep

Another year has come and
gone, and with it has gone a polit-
ical dynasty that has seen the end
of the Cold War and new possibil-
ities for peace. But there’s some-
thing rotten in D.C., and I don’t
mean your Congressman. I’m talk-
ing about all the campaign
promises Bill Clinton made which
are now rotting on the trash heap
of political history.

He’s gone back on his promise
to stop repatriating Haitian
refugees, decided not to revoke
China’s MFN status and changed

But then again,
it's just my opinion

 

Mike
Brittingham

his mind on a middle—class tax cut.
Clinton said during the campaign:
“Don’t read my lips, read my pro-
 The candidate of “change”
has magically changed into the
president of the status quo. But
there’s one promise Bill Clinton
made which must be kept: cut-
ting the deﬁcit.

Yes, I know this has been said
before. It’s been a favorite issue of
many politicians and economists
alike. The 1992 budget deficit is
about $400 billion. That means
that our wise government officials
have spent $400 billion more than
they have in 1992 alone. Our
national debt, which already
stands at about $4 trillion, will
now go up another $400 billion
(not including interest). This
means that we have to pay more

_in interest, causing the govern-

.1/_/////,///..Mxz/r

ment to run more of a deficit,
which causes the interest rates to
go up again and so on. To put it
simply, the country is being
sucked into a black hole of debt,
and if the problem keeps growing
we may never get out.

What’s that? We can’t try to cut
the deficit until the economy gets
better? Not true. For starters we
could cut billions from the federal
budget just by getting rid of gov-
ernment waste. Perhaps you don’t
realize how much waste we’re

Indiana. This is in addition to the
millions of dollars the government
has spent on projects for private
groups and industries.

Most people don’t want to
address the deficit. But it doesn’t
take a rocket scientist to realize
that you can’t run a nation on
debt.

The deﬁcit must be eliminated,
and government waste is a good
place to start. Unfortunately, Bill
Clinton doesn’t realize this. His
plan to cut the deficit has also

\

, }Bs:~ﬁru.1>m YEW5

talking about or what this money
(our money) is being wasted on.
let me clue you in.

Our rniserly government spends
about $1 to $2 billion a year on
furniture and decorating, several
billion dollars a year on cars for
government employees. There's
the infamous “pork barrel” money
that’s distributed by the Congress
to its constituents back home. The
government has spent $219,000 to
teach college students how to
watch TV, $100,000 to study how
to avoid falling spacecraft,
$144,000 to find out if pigeons fol-
low human economic laws,
$84,000 to find out why people
fall in love and $500,000 to build a

been dropped into the dung heap
of political campaign promises.

The new year has arrived. It’s
time to begin anew with a fresh
view on the world. And with this
new view, perhaps our govem-
ment officials, Bill Clinton in par-
ticular, will realize their folly and
make a new year’s resolution to
stop their wasteful spending.
Perhaps then we can begin to put
our economic house in order.
Perhaps then our great nation will
have a bright future ahead of it,
filled with many more new years
of growth and prosperity.

But then again, as with carn-
paign promises, no one
ever keeps their new year’s resolu-
tions.

ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN -—
This past weekend the Pitt
women’s gymnastics team fin-
ished third as it travelled 300
miles for its first meet of the
1993 campaign.

The team competed against
West Virginia University and
the University of Michigan,
who hosted the Second
Annual Blue & Gold Cup
Invitational. The Wolverines
tallied a score of 188.5, the
Mountaineers posted a score
of 182.55 and the Panthers
earned a score of 181.40.

The Panthers lost more than
just the meet. The team was
victimized by yet another pair
of injuries. First-year gymnast
Tracy McKenna suffered a
knee injury prior to the start
of the meet. Brenda Stevens,
another first-year student,
injured her ankle competing

on vault.

“X—rays show that she has
possibly suffered stretched lig-
aments, but doctors will look
at it again just to be sure it is
not broken,” Pitt assistant
coach Ben Rovee said.

This will leave head coach
Debbie Yohman with only
nine gymnasts being able to
compete this Sunday at
William & Mary.

The Panthers competed on
vault for their first leg of the
meet, where they earned a
score of 44.75. Though they
did not score as high as
expected, vaulting should
prove to be their strongest
event throughout the season.

Top scores were provided
by Christine Battista (8.9),
Michaelene “Mikie” Myers
(8.8), Bethany Toellner (9.0),
Brenda Stevens (9.1) and
Alisha Friend (8.95).

Pitt earned a score of 45.45

The Pitt women’s basketball
team removed any doubt of a
possible letdown after its
thrilling come-from-behind
victory over the Georgetown
Hoyas last Saturday with a 69-
64 victory over Boston
College.

The Panthers maintained
their status as the hottest team
in the Big East as they won
their second straight and fifth-
of-six in the Big East.

“[I wasn’t afraid of a let-
down] because even though
we won that game lvs.
Georgetown] we played so
bad in the beginning ”
Panther forward Jonna
Huemrich said. “We know we
can’t take any team for grant-
ed. We knew we had to play
well tonight because of what
happened against
Georgetown. We didn’t want
to get down by so much.”

The five-point victory was
not indicative of Pitt’s domi-
nance throughout the game.
Huemrich, who surpassed the

Yohman said this was a
good score for the first meet
because “the score was high
enough to beat last year’s
team average on bars.”

Top performers on bars
were Shannon Brown (9.0),
Kristen Brown (9.3) and
Stevens (8.9). Career-high
scores were obtained by
Myers (8.85) and Friend (9.4).

The Panthers’ next stop was

on floor. On this event
Yohman was able to use only
five gymnasts instead of the
usual six. Stevens needed to
sit out this event because of
the pain in her ankle, and
there was no other gymnast
strong enough on floor to fill
the void. McKenna is the top
alternate, but she was not in
the condition to compete.
Though they competed with
only five gymnasts, the floor
was the Panthers’ best event
of the day, as they rolled up a

Men's gymnasts ﬁnish second at Navy

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s gymnastics team opened up
its 1993 season with a strong second-place
finish at the Navy Invitational last weekend at
the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.

Pitt’s total team score of 247.20 was just
three points behind the meet’s winner,
William and Mary, which had a total of
250.05. Also competing in the invitational
were squads from Radford University, James
Madison University, Cortland State University

and the host team from Navy.

“We had some major breaks,” head coach
Frank D’Amico said. “But we showed promise
in some events that I thought we would be a

little weak on.”

As expected, the Panthers’ strongest perfor-
mance was once again turned in by their
senior captain, Genaro Severino. Severino,

who missed most of last season with a knee
injury, finished either first or second in all six
events and finished first in the all-around with
an individual total score of 54.50.

Severino captured first place on the floor
exercises (with a mark of 9.15), the vault
(9.10) and the parallel bars (9.05). He also
placed second on the pommel horse (scoring
a 8.60), the still rings (9.35) and on the high

Karl Chan, who earned a second place finish
on the high bar in his first collegiate meet

1,000-point plateau for her
career against the Hoyas, con-
tinued her spectacular play.
She finished the game with 25
points. She was bested for
game-high honors by Eagle
superstar Sarah Behn, whose
important baskets kept the
Eagles in the game as she
racked up 31 points. ,

“They kept getting the ball
to lBehnl,” Huemrich said.
“She was killing us, getting
fouled a lot, went to the line
and made a lot of cheap buck-
ets.”

Guard Jill McElhinny,
though scoring only six
points, hustled at both ends of
the floor, making numerous
steals on defense and creating
big plays on offense.
McElhinny’s stellar defensive
effort was the key in keeping
Boston College off-balance..
The Eagles struggled from the
floor, hitting only 43 percent
of their shots.

The Panthers’ unbelievable
total of only three offensive
rebounds was their Achilles’
heel. Center Turia Ransom
saw only four minutes of
action due to a “strained

kneecap.” But Julie Fornadel,
along with Carolyn Miller and
Tiffany Fingers, picked up her
slack.

“Julie had a very nice
game,” head coach Kirk Bruce
said. “Not only was she post-
ing up hard and calling for the
ball, but the guards were
looking to get it in to her.”

The second half was very
much like the first, as the
Eagles would go on a little
spurt only to see Pitt answer
with a series of critical bas-
kets. Whenever Behn led BC
on a run, Huemrich keyed Pitt
to score a string of points to
stay ahead.

The Eagles were forced to

foul the Panthers late in the
game. Pitt went to the line 33
times but came away with
only 20 points, a 60 percent
average.
1 “We didn’t hit our fouls
shots well tonight,” Huemrich
said. “If we made those I think
we would have had a bigger
lead.”

Behn brought BC to within

four points to give the
Panthers a scare late in the

were provided by Karen
Jorgensen (9.25), Toellner
(9.25), Brown (9.4), Friend
(9.45) and Deena Daller
(8.5). A few spills spoiled a
beautiful performance by
Daller on the floor.

The Panthers finished the
meet on beam where they
earned a score of 45.55.

Yohman pointed out that
this score was good
enough to beat out last
year’s team average on
beam.

The top performers were
Jorgensen (9.1), Daller
(9.05) and Brown (9.4).

Stevens’ score of 8.85
was impressive considering

the severity of pain she was
suffering. Friend earned
another career—high score
(9.15).

“Everyone did what she
was expected to do or

more,” Yohman said.
“Everyone did something
outstanding.“

The team’s attitude was
positive following the meet.

“Next week will be much
better  By the end of the
season we will break the
school record of 186.90,”
Tollner said.

“If they stay healthy and
continue to improve, I pre-
dict Pitt will be at the
Regional Championship for
sure,” said Michigan Coach
Bev Plocki.

A major concern for
D’Amico going into this sea-
son was his team’s young age
and lack of experience. While
he said he doesn’t want to
put anymore pressure onto
the shoulders of his younger
athletes, he admitted that his

team’s performance this past
weekend was a pleasant sur-
prise.

“I am a lot happier now
than I was a week ago,”
D’Amico said.

Orieans and the Final Four.

In fact, recent debates have sug-
gested that college basketball,
minus the recent dominance of a
UNLV or Duke, should split the top
ranking in seven or eight directions.
Seton Hall has made a strong case
recently while the rest of its confer-
ence playmates looked like stiff
mannequins.

All that changed Saturday.

The Big East has begged for an
injection of excitement,a ray of
hope, a game that sparks dialogue
and peaks enthusiasm. Pitt gave it
not one but two games of this
magnitude in a span of four days.

They did it Wednesday at
Connecticut and again Sattuday in
its brawl with the Hall, spurred on
by the lunatic fringe known as the

Field House Fanatics. Of all the
teams in this once-proud confer-
ence, it took the snake—bitten
Panthers.

This game had it all. Big shots.
Big dunks. Big rebounds. Big—tirne
drama. Even big-time in—your-face
smack—talking. The crowd was
unbelievable. It all added up to a
salivating atmosphere that evoked
images of Big East glory days.

ESPN broadcasters must have
been kicking themselves, after tele-
vising so many gruesome Big East
sleepfests, they broadcast Kansas’
uninspiring rout of Louisville
instead of this beauty. Meanwhile,
Pitt and Seton Hall put on the best
contest the Big East Conference has
seen in recent years.

Dick Weiss, the revered basket-
ball scribe of the P/at/adelp/9-r'a Daily

 

News recently ranked Pitt 13th in
his weekly Top 15 poll. That’s sur-
prising, considering the casual
attention the Panthers get else-
where. But Weiss is as respected as
they come, and maybe he knew
something other experts did not

Individually and collectively, this
Pitt team had something to prove.
Respect has not come easily for the
Panthers, and even the two mon-
ster upsets won’t change that.
Saturday, they played like a bunch
that realized  -

McNeal scored the first six points
of the contest and attacked the
glass with maniacal ferocity. The
man they call Big Daddy is shed-
ding that inconsistency label and
shutting up a lot of doubters.

Jerry McCullough, playing in his
first big-time game since being

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, lanuﬂ 20, 1993

anointed the Big East’s top point
guard, showed off prime-time—only
moves. It’s quickly becoming
apparent that Ice can be as good as
he wants to be.

Mobley, the menacing master of
earth—shaking rim-benders, is play-
ing as well as any center in the
east, with all due respect to
Georgetown’s Othella Harrington.
It’s also apparent that by March he
could be one of the best big men
in the nation.

There were signs of the old
Panthers, like McCullough’s ill-
advised oﬂf-balance prayer with Pitt
up 73-72 and 11 seconds left on
the shot clock. They also easily
allowed the final shot attempt by
John Leahy, which appeared, at its
arc, destined to tie the game and
break 7,000 hearts. Free throw

shooting clinics will not be given
by this bunch either.

But Pitt has quietly made serious
inroads in pressure situations. This
week’s upsets may make people
wake up and take notice, but there
were subtle signs earlier in the sea-
son. The Panthers hung tough in
games against West Virginia and
UCLA after the opposition made
repeated runs at them. Saturday
night made you cast a second or
third glance at the ﬂoor when Pitt
stood up to repeated runs by the
fearsome Pirates.

Pitt watched the Hall run off
seven straight points to knot the
score at 31, then recovered to score
eight of the first halfs final 12
points. Early in the second stanza,
the Panthers watched a 10-2 Pirate
run slice a 55-44 margin to 57-54.
Pitt responded with a five—point
mini—run of its own. And finally,
after seeing its 72-65 lead evaporate
in the final four minutes, Garrick
Thomas’ monumental shot kept the
Hall at bay once more.

Pitt fended off each spurt in large
part because of depth. Paul Evans
received contributions from more
sources than the Salvation Anny at
Christmas. The Panthers would not
have pulled this off without the
blue-collar efforts of Brian Brush,
Orlando Antigua and Chris Gant.

“It feels real good to beat the
number seven team in the nation,
but it wasn’t just me, it was the
whole team,” Thomas said. “It’s a
team effort every time we step out
onto the ﬂoor.”

“Our bench has been real good
for us all year. The bench_has been
as good as we’ve ever had it,”
Evans said.

Evans was also quick to say
there’s a lot of season left and the
schedule gets downright brutal
from here. This week features a trip
to Boston College, and the next
two home games aren’t even home
games. The Syracuse and Villanova
contests have been banished to the
dead zone known as the Civic
Arena. There's a rugged road trip to
Seton Hall and Illinois looming.
Respect is coming slowly, but more
performances like this one won’t
hurt.

“Pitt played tough from the start
and played hard for 40 minutes,”
Dehere said. “We can’t take any-
thing away from them, they
deserved to win. It’s a loss, but
you’ll be hearing from Seton Hall
very soon.”

The truest measure of success in ‘

college basketball is winning in
March, something Pitt has never
done. In fact, February is usually
enough to make Pitt quietly wither
away to despair.

Pitt teams have taken baby steps
before, only to fall and wind up
with skinned knees and shattered
hopes. Even last year they were 11-
4 and 3-0 in the conference at one
point. It’s much too early to say
that this time will be different than
all those other exasperating roller-
coaster rides to obscurity.

In the last week, Pitt has taken
larger strides, but only time will tell
how far the team can run. Its still
tough to bet on this season becom-
ing a memorable one, but after the
last week, how can you bet against
it’

unfortunately, I was not commis-

What I discovered was some-

patrons already know
Caleco’s on Oakland Avenue has
the best wings in town.

‘We take pride in making sure
our wings are fresh,” owner
Eileen Carey said.

The family-owned bar’s
Wednesday wing night is one of
the most popular specials in
Oakland. So much so, that Carey
said they go through at least 200
pounds of Strip District fresh
wings every Wednesday.

Caleco’s wings, prepared by
the half, are bigger than most
with plenty of meat on them.
Whole wings look more like
what you would get from mom
or in a family restaurant. They
use a Durkee Hot sauce base and
you can buy 15 wings for $3.50
or 20 wings for $4.00.

“We have a cult following,”
manager Bryan Carey said. “We
have people call up every

    

SORRENTO’S

ITALIANO RESTORENTE

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 20, 1993

Caleco's Wings it better than anyone else in town

Wednesday night to order
wings.”

“We get the same faces in here
every week, so we must be
doing something right,” Eileen
Carey said. It may take a little
longer to get your wings at
Caleco’s, but it is well worth the
wait.

“We’d rather have people wait
longer to make sure they’re
good,” wing chef Colleen Carey
said.

Accompanying Caleco’s wings
is a ranch dressing made from
only the freshest ingredients, and
when combined with their sauce
creates a distinct and delicious
flavor. Even their mild sauce
leaves a warm feeling in your
mouth that you are glad to take
home with you and ensures that
you will be back again next
week.

Of the wings in the survey,
Mitchel1’s in North Oakland
comes in a close second to
Caleco’s. A creation of the restau—

rant Charlies, these wings are the
only ones in town that come with
their own heat dial. But be
warned: Use that dial with
extreme caution.

Mitchell’s wings can be
ordered from number ﬁve (hot)
to number 10, what wing chef
Christian Nicholson calls his
“thermonuclear” sauce. He is not
kidding. Mitchell’s number 10
wings are without a doubt the
hottest in town.

They modified their Cayenne
pepper sauce recipe six months
ago and their brisk wing business
has not slowed down. Number
10 is teeming with evil little devils
set on burning your mouth out
—— a guaranteed nose-runner.
You can pick up six for $2.95
and a dozen for $5.00.

Nicholson said he uses the
hottest pepper known to man to
make #10 so dangerous. Well,
that would explain the lumps in
the sauce (probably parts of the

Continued from page D-5


Original Manager Terry Simon
said the shops busiest time is late
night. “We do a big business at
night," she said.

Simon said that while competi-
tion may put the  pizza down
as cheaply priced means cheaply
made, “lthe shop] uses all quality
stuff. Everything in the pizza --
the cheese, everything we buy, is
top of the line.

“The only reason the price is
that cheap is because we have

enough volume to do that. There
are a lot of pizzas sold here. We
try to do it for the kids.”

Another pizza shop that fits the
student budget is Domino’s Pizza,
located on North Craig Street. If
you’re crazy about pepperoni, try a
slice of the pepperoni special.

‘The pepperoni pizza is deﬁnite-
ly our most selling pizza,” Manager
Norm Gatz said. “There’s more
than a fair share of pepperoni on
it.”

Okay, you say you’re looking
for something a little different from

the regular pie. At Metros Pizza,
on the corner of Forbes and
Oakland Avenues, check out the
gourmet offerings.

There’s the tropical Hawaiian
pizza, topped with pineapple, ham
and extra cheese. Also, there is the
veggie pizza, topped with green
peppers, mushrooms and onions.

On Atwood Street, SOrrento’s
Pizza has 21 Chicago-style pizza that

Italian way.”

Guenther said the trick to a great
Chicago pie is to use a special
sauce. Instead of using a regmlar
pizza sauce, Guenther said
Sorrento’s uses a type of tomato
pulp that sinks into the cheese,
giving it a special zesty ﬂavor.

White pizza, a combination of
spices, cheese, tomato and ricotta,

lS also a favorite.

“But all of our pizzas are spe-
 Guenther said. “We take the
time to maybe leave that pizza in
40 seconds longer, to make it bet-
ter.”

Finally, Napoli Pizza on Fifth
Avenue also offers a white pizza.
Toppings available include broc-
coli and spinach.

“Miami Subs had the best dressing and
tastiest buns, but Uncle Sam’s was by far the

’ best all—around sub,” he said. “The diagonal

slicing allows for a delectable mouthful of
meat every time, instead of having to work
your way through the bun.”

Zumstein said that Uncle Sam’s was num-
ber one because it had a nice combination
of everything.

“Packed full of goodies. Number one!”
Walborn agreed.

Miami Subs took number three. Miami
Subs is located at 3815 Forbes Ave.

“Fresh, great bread, a little wet, but a lot of
lettuce and tomato,” Kovaly and Pankuch
said. “Very Italian—y!”

Walborn said that Miami Subs had the
“best buns.”

The number four position went to Larry
and Carol’s, located at 410 Semple St.

“Pretty good! Sweet, tangy taste,” Kovaly
and Pankuch said.

Birch said it was great. “A lot of veggies,”
she added.

Other sub shops sampled were from
Metro Pizza, Sorrento’s Pizza, The Original
Hot Dog Shop and Subway.

Eshelman said that the Subway sub was
great because there were “a lot of veggies
and spicy meats.”

Birch said that she liked Sorrento’s sub
because it had a “meaty pizza flavor.”

Thanks to all of the taste—testers and area
sub shops for making this taste test happen!

One of Hong Kong Express’ specialties, and a favorite among
Pitt News staffers, is the boneless sparerib dinner. A dish which,
according to the manager, “cannot be found anywhere else in
Pittsburgh. It’s the only thing we ever run out of. Very popular.”

It’s no wonder. The ribs are prepared under a broiler and
cooked in a deliciously sweet sauce, then cut into strips and laid
on a bed of fried rice. It makes a meal that’s deﬁnitely hard to
beat for the price, not to mention hard to finish.

Guaranteed to satisfy the hungriest customer. Hong Kong
Express, with its varied menu and great prices is a definite best
bet for students and a “must try” for everyone who appreciates
good Chinese food.

Slightly more expensive (still very reasonable) and a little
more atmospheric, Yum Wok provides a hot, delicious, quick
Chinese food prepared unbelievably quick and served so hot
you’ll have to wait to eat it. Among the many dishes we sam-
pled our favorites included pork lo mein, General Tao’s
Chicken, which was bathed in a particularly tangy sauce, and
the honey chicken, a sort of chicken wing dinner with hot
honey sauce. Yum Wok is decidedly student—oriented, the
atmosphere is quite relaxed. They offer both take-out and eat-
in.

If you’re going, it’s located right on South Craig Street. So stop
in, especially if you’re pressed for time. You’ll be amazed, not
only by how fast your food arrives, but by how very good it
tastes!

The last restaurant we make mention of PastAmoné, is not
because it was the worst, but because it was the most difficult
to group. Located on Atwood Street in Oakland, it is one of
three restaurants (Simply French, and Mai Thai are the other
two) owned by a man known the world over as Bikky.

Our confusion stems from a dish called Penne. We couldn’t
decide whether to refer to it as Chinese, Italian, Chinese—ltalian
or Italian—Chinese. Whatever region of the world you favor, the
recipe is the same and the taste amazing. This ginger chicken
dish, served on a bed of pasta is well worth the price of admis-
sion (S8.95 which includes salad). But the menu is very reason-
able ranging from $6.95 to $8.95. So if you want to take a date
to a nice, romantic restaurant that won’t set you back, this one
is well worth considering. You won’t regret it.

chicken that couldn’t take the

heat).

Number 10 is a potentially
painful eating experience that
should be endeavored by only
the well-seasoned wing—eaters.
Amateurs attempting to eat on
the edge should either be mouth-
numb or drunk. When you down
a couple of these hot marnmas,
you won’t be able to forget them
for at least a couple hours. Go
ahead and try.

Peter’s Pub on Oakland
Avenue can sling wings with the
best of them. Although they are
not exceptionally hot, they have
enough kick to satisfy both the
wing-eating veteran and the beer-
chasing novice. Monday night,
their wing night, Peters will go
through almost 300 pounds of
chicken wings and at least two
gallons of hot sauce, according to
manager David Manestink.

Like all good wing-makers,
Peter’s buys its wings fresh so
they are good and meaty. But to
enjoy them, they only make them
on Mondays.

Probably the most tasted wing
in Oakland can be found at CJ.
Barney’s. The convenient Forbes
Avenue restaurant/bar serves its
wings every day in various quan-
tities. If you plan to eat light, you
can pick up 12 wings for $3.95 or
share 25 wings with a date for
$6.95. The heartier souls can stuff
their faces with a small bucket of
40 wings for $9.95 or a large
bucket of 80 for $18.95.

What separates C.J.’s from the
rest is its gourmet wings. In addi-
tion to traditional hot, you can
get honey barbecue, teriyaki,
honey mustard, hot barbecue
and garlic.

C.J’s buys wings frozen so you ’

do not get the same tender quali-
ty of fresh wings, but they are
crispy and tasty none the less.
They are plenty hot enough and
the ﬂavor will leave the bar with
you. It is not so much a deep
burning feeling throughout the
mouth but rather a tingle on your
tongue.

Wing night at C.].’s is Friday
from 5 to 6 p.m. when you can
pick up some up for 20 cents
each. I

Finally we come to the Attic.
This bar is quickly becoming
famous for its great Mexican cui-
sine, but don’t add its wings to
the legend yet.

On the plus side, the Attic does
use fresh wings for a better,
meatier product, and they are
going to start selling them every
night. They use whole wings so
you get a lot of food for the
money (prices slightly higher
than C.J.’s).

You get the feeling though that
they don’t put a lot of time and
effort into their wings. The ones I
sampled were a little fatty and
the mild sauce on them was OK
but not unique or exceptional.

The Forbes Avenue location
has become an Oakland hotspot
but it has not yet established itself
as a top—notch wing joint. Owner
Emery Levick said his Monday
wing night goes through about
80 pounds of wings and are hop-
ing to have more success with
that special in the future. But
they will have to dip into Peter’s
Pub wing night to do it.
