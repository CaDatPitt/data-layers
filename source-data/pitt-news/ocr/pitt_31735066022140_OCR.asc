 

City Council
Votes to save
mosque site

By David T.’ Welch

Asst. News Editor

As the demolition crew hammers away
at the Syria Mosque, City-Council passed
an amendment which approved the
Historical Review Committee’s
recommendation to designate the site of
the mosque as part of the Schenley Farms
Historic District.

The amendment, which passed by a
vote of 4 to 3, would make the site of the
mosque a historic landmark. If ratified in
a second vote on Sept. 10, this would give
City"Council some inﬂuence in deciding
what type of building will be constructed
after the mosque is demolished.

Efforts to save the mosque itself have
faded because much of the building’s
exterior has been demolished already.
City Council member Jim Ferlo’s original
proposal was to preserve the building.

But because of the exterior damage he’
changed the proposal to preserve only the
site. “It is a travesty. Unfortunately the
wrecking ball has already preceded, ” Ferlo
said. “Without support of [Pitt] P-resident].
Dennis O’Connor or Mayor Masloff, we
will not be able to save the structure.”

Lew Borman, a spokesperson for the
mayor, said he “did not anticipate any
statements [from the mayor concerning
the mosquel.” 9

Council member Michelle Madoff
opposed efforts to save the structure. “We
are a day late and a dollar short. Where
were the people concerned about the
preservation of the mosque before this
happened? This building still belongs to
the Shriners. What right do we have to tell
the Shriners that they are going to have to
come up with the money for this building?
I think what we’re doing is unreasonable,”
Madoff said.

Ferlo, who is also a member of the Save
the Syria Mosque Committee, proposed
the amendment. “My amendment seeks to
preserve and be concernedabout the site.
This amendment is attempting to approve
the building and the site as a historical
monument.”

Ferlo wants City Council to prevent
building on the site that is out of character
with the Schenley Farms District. “We
want to safeguard the site. We don’t want
a suburban building in the historic area of
the Oakland Civic Corps,” Ferlo said.

Madoff agreed but did not vote in favor
of the amendment because she doubted
City Council could legally restrict what
type of building could be built on the site.
“My feelings are that there needed to be a
meeting between the developers and the
Historical Review Committee to ensure a
decent—looking building [will be built on
the site], not a glass curtain, but something

. with integrity. ‘

“I personally don’t like the building, but
you have to maintain the integrity of the
area. My question is, ‘Can we legally make
them put up a decent building,?” Madoff
said. ‘

New Greek alcohol polic

By Bob Maselli
Staff Writer

Kegs of beer at parties are strictly
prohibited by the new Greek alcohol
policy, said Inter—Fraternity Council officers
yesterday. Open parties are also prohibited.

The policy, which went into effect Aug.
29, also said that no alcohol can be
purchased by any member of a chapter on

A behalf of that chapter.

Alcoholic beverages cannot be
purchased with fraternity or sorority funds,
and all social events with ﬁve or more
members must be registered with the IFC
48 hours before the event. A Bring Your
Own Bottle policyrwas the alternative to
having kegs.

Other clauses written into the policy are
that servers must be 21 and attend alcohol-
education programs. Two members of
Greeks Advocating Mature Management
of Alcohol must attend every social event.

Many of the students agreed with sections
of the policy but felt that the IFC didn’t
give the individual fraternities a chance to
agree to the policy.

“Why wasn’t there a discussion before
this policy was written up?” said Doug
Shaulis, a member of Delta Sigma Phi. “We
could have discussed the good and bad
before this was written up.” » V

Jeff Graeber, president of Triangle, an
engineering fraternity that is reorganizing
after being absent from campus last year,
agreed. _

Graeber said, “I totally agree with the
IFC instilling a policy, but there are some
foggy things that need to be worked out.
T 0 be honest, everyone drinks, and the
clause about having no kegs isn’t going to
help the drinking problem. We must control

our own events.”

Greek adviser Bridget Guernsey said
some changes might be made and it will

take some time to adjust to the new rules. '

“This will not have an effect on Greek

numbers,” said Guernsey." “This program v

is happening all over the United States,
and numbers are growing.”

“We did this because the state law,
national law and university laws are

changing about the aspects of drinking,’

and we have to take. a stand,’.’,said

See Protest, page 4

Guernsey. “Earlier this summer, [William _
Harmon, vice president of StudentAffairsl
brought to me the idea of a ‘drug-free
work act.’ This policy goes along with
that. The main thing the policy will do, is.
reduce liability to the fraternities and
sororities. It’s a moral issue for us, and the
parents love the idea.”

“There hasn’t been really any major
problems with alcohol on campus, but

before it happens, we want to have this
policy,” added Guernsey.

Many times during the forum, tempers

flared as Greeks questioned the fairness of
the policy. Andy Feldman, internal vice ‘
president of the IFC and Zeta Beta Tau \
member, was on hand to explain that
wasn’t thecase at all. '

“The IFC is not a Gestapo that is out to

get you,” said Feldman, “This policywas
written up for your protection. We thought
this out.”

Harmon said this was the best possible "

way to stop overindulgence.

“We are putting the responsibility in the _ ,

hands of the Greeks, "and they must learn
to control it." ,  g . ‘ 4

U.S.—Middle East cooperation strengthens peace plan

By Debbie Lincoln
Staﬂ“ Writer

‘The Bush administration’s
Middle East peace plan stands
apart from past unsuccessful
efforts because of the encouraging

initiatives taken by regional

leaders, according to Pitt political-

‘ science Professor Sandra Halprin.

“There’s a consensus for the
first time among very strange
bedfellows,” said Halprin, a
Middle East specialist, referring
to friendly talks between the

' United States and Syria as well as

recent U.S.—Pa1estinian talks.
Halprin called the open alliance
between U.S. and Arab leaders
an “optimistic regional
configuration.
“With Syria being on board,

l

 

 

 

this was really turning a corner
on the peace process,” she said.
“Gulf states are now openly
allyingthemselves with the U.S.
because the U.S. has pulled them
out of a sticky spot."

World events have worked in
favor of a U.S.-dominated peace
conference by forcing Middle East
governments to garner U.S.
approval in exchange for financial
aid in the years to come.

Jordan and Israel are seeking
to rebuild their economies, which
suffered from the Gulf war and
an influx of refugees in the past

8 year. Syria is looking to replace

both the monetary and military
support it formerly enjoyed from
the Soviet Union. These factors,
combined with an attentive

Halprin also indicated that the
hard—line stances on Palestinian
independence by Arab leaders
are being abandoned in favor of
an autonomous Palestinian
territory, a view more in line with
many Israelis. She said, “Both
Arab delegates as well as Israelis
will be in favor of some kind of
autonomy as a starting point.”

Amitai Rotem, a native of Tel
Aviv and an Israeli cultural
emissary to Pittsburgh, agrees that
a Palestinian state is an unrealistic
goal. Because of ideological
divisions among the Palestinian
leadership, it could only be

instability in the region.

Rotem predicted that the
traditional leaders of the
Palestinians will be pushed out of
the peace process and replaced
by leaders from the occupied
territories who are willing to make
more concessions to the
Americans and Israelis.

“We’ll witness in the near future
a weakening of the Palestine
Liberation Organization and a new
leadership in the territories,”
Rotem said. “This is what Israel
has always wanted.” ‘

Rotem said Israelis are looking
toward the conference as a way
to make peace with their
individual Arab neighbors, end
the economic boycott imposed
by several Arab countries,

Shabba Ranks fre

By Brian Berger

S bowcase Editor

The rasta revolution is in full effect due
to a sum of parts that equal a whole. The
continual rise of Bob Marley and Peter
T osh’s legacies, the white youth acceptance
of the sounds, the growth in black
awareness by African-Americans and, of
course, sensimilia have all led to reggae’s
spurt.

Another reason for the reggae coup'that
pounds our ears, is its somewhat recent
fusion/ (1 hate that word) with hip-hop
music. Rappers like Chubb Rock and.KRS—
One of the mighty Boogie Down
Productions have stolen from the island
pulse and laid down funky three—chord

grooves. Why not? Both are dancy as hell
and sung in smooth rhyme style that even
Shakespeare would be shakin’ to, and the
roots are ﬁrmly planted likeievergreens
with one another.

But this piece isn’t about rap, at least not
directly; this is about Shabba Ranks,
reggae’s newest pheriom. Ranks has been
burnin’ up dance charts all over the world
for the last 10 years, but only recently has
he gotten props in the States. His major
label debut on Epic Records is number
one on the College Music Journal charts
and Ranks has scored on black radio with
a duet with reggae/r & b—crossover Maxi
Priest entitled “House Call,’’ but in the
meantime Ranks has been rippin’ up the
nation with his powerful live show.

Born Rexton Rawlston Fernando Gordon
in 1966, Ranks moved with his family to
Trenchtown, Jamaica (home of Marcus
Garvey and Marley and the Wailers), at the
age of three. About 10 years later, Ranks
started listening to the sounds of Brigadier
Jerry, MC Charlie Chaplin, Yellowman
and Josey Wales, who Ranks heralded as
his “greatest inspiration.”

At age 14, Ranks shocked with his raw
delivery, as he released his first single,
“Heat Under Sufferer’s Feet,” under the
name Co—Pilot. The single, a four man
toast, placed second in the lineup; thus the
title Co-pilot. In 1981 Co-pilot released his
first single as Shabba Ranks, called “Holda
Fresh,” on King Jammy’s label. “Fresh” is
a song about bathing.

Ranks then went on to record a string of a. ; 
hit singles, on various labels, for a plethora ."'r'7i:=

of Jamaican producers, including Dennis

Star and Black Scorpio, as well as appearing ’. 

on wax with stars Dennis Brown and

Gregory Isaacs, among others. It wasn’t 
until 1987 that Ranks finally scored with  
his mega—bomb “live Blanket,” the song. . 

which launched Shabba on tour outside of

Jamaica and introduced the U.K. and tl'ie  
northeastern United States to his wallop ' 

style of rhyme. «

‘Since then Ranks has unleashed a slew / 
of non-stop hits, like “Come fromJamaica’’i ” 

and “Get up, Stand up, and Rock,” as well . 

as the Caribbean/U.S.—s‘mash, “Wicked in-

'  PITT NEWS, Thursday,’ September 5,1991

New   York oise  comp is aces

peak hours. The mole people,
as the media now calls them,
are justa tip on the proverbial
iceberg of New York’s
amphetamine—injected
cybernetic insanity, the daily
reality of the city’s 11 million-
plus inhabitants.

Ladies and gentlemen, here
lies the fodder for the-inspiration
of Gerard Cosloyfs latest
compilation: New York Eye/1 nd

, 5814 FORBES AVE.

521-Z100

   
 
 
 
 
   
     
    

Ear Control Cosloy, one of the
architects of the ’80s indie rock
scene who, via the management of
Homestead Records, brought to
the forefront the likes of The Ex,
Big Black, My Dad Is Dead and
Live Skull, as well as.maj_or-label
cash-money successes Dinosaur,
Jr., and the last best hope for
saving pop music from terminal
banality, Sonic Youth. He has given
us a sampling of the ’90s
noisemakers, the new vestals of
the scenes hearth:

Each sample is like a difficult
scab, unique in its size and shape
but still eager for you to rip it off.
Painful and unsightly, yes, but that

don’t mean it ain’t fun. 

Now to begin here without first
mentioning how blessed we have
been within the last 12 months to
have ‘seen many of these bands I
right here in the ‘Burgh would be
callous and cold to all of y’all out
there who helped book ‘em. Dust
Devils, Cop Shoot Cop,
Borbetomagus, Railroad Jerk and
The Unsane have all thrown their 3"
aesthetic into motion‘ right here
within the confines of the Oakland
area. -

In a way there’s irony here. I _
mean, here we live in a rusted- out,
post—atrocity, industrial decay, and
in comes these guys to provide the
score. If that don't ring bells, try
this: Drive through Hazelwood or
McKeesport on a hazy night with

this comp in your deck. Make sure »

Continued from page S-3

Politti invited Shabba to guest rhyme on their cover of the
Beatles’ “She’s A Woman.” - ',

On Ranks latest, As Raw A5 Ever (the Epic debut), the mad
Jamaican turns loose his slack (sex) side with “House Call” and
“A Mi Di Girls Dem Love.” To which Ranks responds, “Listen to
the clean and the x—rated alike,and give me my just rewards. I'm
like a coin; Shabba Ranks is not one—sidedl” _
. All of this is completely irrelevant unless you see Ranks
(whose name comes from gangster fable) live on stage where
he’s at his improvisational best. Rapping in a fierce, dominate ; ’
style, Shabba comes off live like a hand grenade, explodingup '
and down the stage with his most powerful flair. Prepare to be
taken. » U

This is Cosloy’s (he now runs,

the 1988 Human Music

things considered, aces— except
for his rehash of a Dust Devils

Junk Monkeys
Five Star Fling
Metal Blade Records

Imagine Jane's Addiction, Tom
Petty, The Dead Milkmen, The
Sex Pistols and Faith No More all
rolled up into one band, and that
will give you an idea of what the
Junk Monkeys sound like. The
four members of the band have
seen fit to take themselves where
few others have gone before.

Like Faith No More, Junk
Monkeys cannot really be
classiﬁed into any one music
category. They seem to ﬂoat from
punk to alternative to thrash, and
they do that well.

Overall the album is an
excellent piece of work. The three
songs that really stand out on the
album are “Everyone Can See
You”, “Skippin’ Stones” and a
cover of Pete Townshend’s “A
Quick One.” - ‘

“Everyone Can See You” starts
out acoustically. The song runs in
a totally different direction than
the other songs on the album. It
also has a saxophone solo for
another unusual twist. The
instrumentals in the song are also
very laid back and relaxing. This
is the kind of song you put on
when you want to kick back and
relax. I think ‘if the band continued
to run in this direction, they might
be able to make a big name for
themselves. Overall this is the
best song on the album. ‘

Moving along to “Skippin’
Stones,” it has a punkish sound,
very reminiscent of the Sex Pistols

see and feel the underbelly for
yourself. Just take me up on my
advice, and jump into your ride,
head down to‘ Hazelwood, and
start pickin’ scabs.

or the Violent Femmes.‘This is
another good song both musically
and vocally. The music and vocals
blend nicely without one
overpowering the other. The
guitar solo at the end of the song
is another musical standout. Most
guitar solos are predictable, but
this solo is all over the ‘place yet
it does not sound bad. In fact, the
album is probably worth buying
for this solo alone.

Pete

Now imagine if

Townshend had decided to play
punk instead of rock, and you
would have a fair idea of what “A
Quick One” sounds like. Like
“Skippin’ Stones," the song has
many musical twists and turns
that work well.

Like I said earlier, the album is
a nice piece of work, but there is
one exception to this. “Marigold”
has nothing going for it save for
the drum work. It seems as if this
song was written so that Dan

Allen could showcase hisdrum

work. This song can be skipped. ,

The band is a good band, but
because of their style, you will
probably never see them in the
Top 40. But they may be able to
obtain a cult following of
dedicated listeners. On a scale of

1 to 10, this album gets an 8. If ,

you are in the mood for an unusual

twist to standard music, orif your '

taste runs the gamut of unusual
music, go out and buy this album.

Pitt must stop Eagles
potent ground attack

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

A Southern Mississippi head

coach Jeff Bower likes to pass.
A quarterback at Southern Miss

in 1975 and 1974, his passing

game ranked 28th and 33rd best

in-the nation those year. He
ranks among the top 10 in career
passing yardage, total offense and
touchdown passes. In recent years
he has been the architect of a
high—powered passing attack at
USM and other schools. In Bower’s
first game as head coach,
quarterback Brett Favre threw for
341 yards in the 1_99OAll-American
Bowl.

So it logically follows that on
Saturday, the Golden Eagles will
present, according to Bower, “a
tailback—oriented, fairly
conservative offense.”

What? _

"No, Bower hasn't had a huge
conversion to the running game,
nor is he lacking confidence in

his offense. He’s just playing to
his strengths this year.

“Your quarterback really
determines your offense,” said
Pitt coach Paul Hackett. “You just
do the things you can do best.
You can’t overdo what you ask
of the quarterback.”

Southern Miss’ quarterback isn’t
the golden-armed Favre, who
now toils for the Atlanta Falcons
of the National Football League.
He is redshirt first-player T ommie
Waters, who wasn’t even
supposed to be the starting signal-
caller this year. But fellow redshirt
Eric Estes, projected to be the
starter, retired from the game
after suffering a severe
concussion, so Waters got the
call.

Waters had a low-key but solid

_ performance lastweek, throwing

for 187 yards, completing 10 of
14 attempts.

“We don't want to give him too
much to handle, not too many
responsibilities,” said Bower.

Most of Waters’ responsibilities
revolve around handing the ball
off to tailback Tony Smith. Smith
is the experienced ‘member of
the backfield, having led the
Golden Eagles in rushing a year
ago, as well as handling return
duties.

Smith racked up 1,481 all-
purpose yards in 1990, ranking
him 23rd among Division I
leaders. He also had the ninth
best punt—return average (13.3
yds/return); V
“Tony Smith is outstanding,”
Hackett said. “He runs with a
shiftiness that makes you miss.”

Although he is described as
shifty, Smith is not small at six-
feet, three—inches and 218
pounds. “We plan to get him the
ball as much as we possibly can,”
Bower said. He carried 16 times
for 71 yards in USM’s 25-7 win
over Delta State last week.

Paving the way for Smith is an
offensive line comprised of five
seniors, including preseason All—
American Chafan Marsh. Marsh
plays on the right side, along
with 6-8,. 300—pound tackle Chris
Ryals. 1

Despite the absence of a big
passing attack, the Golden Eagles’
receiving corps is solid. Starting
split end Mark Montgomery was
injured last week, however, and
remains doubtful for Saturday’s
contest. As a unit, the receivers
possess good speed, which
worries Hackett.

“Southern, Miss is fast and
confident. The speed factor is
critical,”Hacket said.

This is a team which beat
Alabama and Auburn last year
and averaged over five yards a
play last week while compiling
364 yards in total offense.
Southern Miss did have a problem
holding on‘ to the ball against
Delta State (fumbling eight times), .
which Bower called “an area
we’ve got to improve on.”

The Golden Eagles probably
won’t dazzle the crowd with
offensive fireworks Saturday, but
they present a solid running attack
for Pitt to contend with. “This
team knows exactly how to play
in big games,” said Hackett, “and

they are probably the;South’s“

Big plays were often missing
from Pitt's arsenal last season,
and the departure of offensive
standouts Curvin Richards,
Darnell Dickerson and Olanda
Truitt left many to question the
explosiveness of this year’s
Panthers. ‘

But Saturday’s 34-3 victory over
West Virginia marked the return
of the big play. It’s no coincidence
that this also marked the return of
Steve Israel.

Israel played in just five games
last year before knee and shoulder
injuries ended his season. In ’89
he missed the final seven games
after tearing ligaments in his right
knee at Mountaineer Field. He
returned this summer, prepared
to win back his left cornerback
spot and revive the Panthers.’
special teams with his game-
breaking speed. Pitt fans_ didn’t
have to wait very long.

The senior wasted no time in
making his presence felt. Israel

picked off Darren Studstill’s first
pass of the night and raced 26
yards, putting the Panthers in
business at the West Virginia 21.
Although the offense failed to
capitalize on Israel’s theft, West
Virginia received a harsh message;
they were in for a rough evening
if they intended to throw in Israel’s
direction.

“It felt great to intercept my first
big pass on ESPN, in front of
national television,” said Israel,
who credited his interception and
the overall performance of the
defense to the preparation of the
coaching staff.

“West Virginia has great talent,
especially at receiver with
[Michael] Beasley and Uamesljett

ihas world-class speed,” said Israel.

“Defensively our coaches were
prepared for everything they were
going to do.” A

After a Markjohnson field goal

As a public service to all the new
students, we decided to document the
proper method of completing an important
campus task. No, we’re not referring to
skipping ahead of graduating seniors in
the registration process; were talking about
watching (and enjoying) a college football
game.

It seems that most of the students here
at.Pitt, new or not, are in desperate need
of such instruction. Perhaps guidance is
the key to overcoming what is an

‘embarrassment for many people. Last

spring the football staff came to the
realization that the team was out of touch
with the student body, and something

' ' needed to be done. This is true to a certain

extent, but the students also haven’t done
much to remain connected with any of the
athletic programs on campus.

The first problem is that of attendance.
Generally speaking, the best way to enjoy
a college football game is to be in the
proximity of the playing field. One of the
greatironies about Pitt is to hear someone
complaining about this team or that team
without actually having been at the game.
Attendance isn’t a difficult achievement,
either. Even if you don't have season
tickets, there are plenty of people willing
to part with theirs.

Of course one problem with attendance
is that it requires getting to the stadium,
conveniently located atop a nice hill. Now,
we would never advocate (gasp!) physical
activity from our fellow students, but hey,
try it. You might enjoy it. As a final point
about attendance, we understand that most
of you like to imbibe certain substances
before the game as a ritual of sort. This is
optional, but doing so can either help you
enjoy the game or prevent it altogether.
We’l1 address that shortly.

Next we come to the physical and

Pitt to face ‘No—Name

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

Last year, the Southern
Mississippi defense acquired the
nickname “the No-Name
Defense.” Now they seem to have
made themselves known.

“Thad McDowell and Arnie
Williams form a tremendous
inside—linebacker duo,” said Pitt
head coach Paul Hackett. And
even though he didn’t recite the
names of the remaining defensive
players, I-Iackett was quick to
point out that 10 ofthe starting 11
are seniors.

McDowell and Williams are the
core of a group that finished fifth
-in scoring defense, allowing an
average of 12.82_ points per game,
and 15th in total defense, giving
up 297 yards per game. That 1990
unit returns all but three starters,
and all three were members of
the secondary.

“We didn’t change a lot from
last year,” said head coach Jeff
Bower. “We basically play a read
defense, and there was no reason
to change.”

One change that has taken place
is the hiring of former Florida
assistantjim Dickey as defensive
coordinator. Dickey’s Florida
teams ranked high among the
national leaders consistently and
were ranked first twice. Dickey’s
style at Florida was to make use
of the blitz out of simple schemes,
and that will continue at Southern
Miss. “We would like to be able

-‘IT-E ‘.III§Ii‘s'I“u'I'““‘

to run the blitz anywhere on the
field,” said Dickey.

In a blitzing defense you need
athletes and depth. The Golden
Eagles have their share of athletes,
but the depth at several positions
is superior Inside linebacker Rod
Lynch was the second—leading
tackler last year with 106, but he
does not start this year '

Up front, tackles Tim Roberts
and Pete Antoniou combined for
11 sacks in 1990 and anchored a
group that allowed only 123 yards
rushing a game. Nose tackle Tim
Miller is the least experienced
and smallest of the front three.

Southern Miss plays an odd
version ofa 4-3, using linebacker
James Singleton as a pass—rushing
end. Although listed as defensive
ends, Singleton and backup

corner and a third—team All-
American at free safety. But once
again seniors comprise the entire
unit, all of whom have game
experience.

In their first game, the Golden
Eagle defense gave up 134 yards
to Delta State, just 18 in the air,
forcing the opposing quarterback
into a 2-12 passing performance.
All this in spite of a fumble-prone
offense which gave the ball away
five times.

Steelers hapless offense easy prey for Bills tough defense 

By Brian Berger

and Rob Pugliese
T be Pitt News

MCs Peanut Butter and Jelly
licked the spread for a 3-0 mark
last week (3-1 with our mandatory
Steeler pick). After we walloped
‘em on Saturday, we continued
to make a mockery of the spreads
on Sunday. Week Two has
arrived, and we’re riding against
some bogus spreads this time
around.

In our exhibition pick, Bubby
meets the Bills 

Pittsburgh Steelers at Buffalo
Bills (~8 1/2).

The Steelers are 1-0 following
their lethargic 26-20 victory over
the San Diego Chargers. On
offense, tailback Barry Foster
impressed with a solid 78-yard
effort on 17 carries. But the
Steelers still have major problems.

They have to find a way to get the _

ball to the wideouts more,
particularly to Louis Lipps, who
caught only one pass last week.

On defense, Pittsburgh could
be in for a nightmare trying to
stop Thurman Thomas. Not only
will Thomas have a big day
running the football, but who is
going to cover him out of the
backﬁeld? If the Steelers worry
too much about Thomas, look
for tight end Keith McKeller to
have a big day as well. The Bills
(1-0) rolled up 55 points on Don
Shula and the Dolphins last week,
and we think that they’ll start fast

and gain quick control of the
game.

Here’s the bottom line: The
Bills’ offense is great; the Steeler
defense is very good. The Bills’
defense is good; the Steelers’
offense stinks. We’ll give the
nuggets. Take Buffalo -8 1/2.

OK. Grab the remote, and pass
the hors d’oeuvres. 2

Indianapolis Colts at Miami
Dolphins (-8).

The Indy Colts have gained a
healthy and content Eric
Dickerson but lost all pride and
respect around the league. Why,
you ask? They lost, at home, to
the New England Patriots last
week. That’s right: at home. That’s
right: to the Patriots. ' 1

Jeff George will have a big
year, but Dickerson’s return to
form was expected to ease the
pressure, and Eric the Great didn’t
show all that much against the
Patsies. The Colts’ defense looked
very stingy, however. Here’s a
little stat: After one week Indy
leads the AFC _in defense. But

Dolphins will be firing.

Marino came out smoking
against the Bills in Buffalo. Even
with a number of injuries and
holdouts riddling the Dolphs,
Marino still singed the Bills for
267 yards and three touchdowns.
Tailback Mark Higgs was the
surprise of the entire league with

(146 yards against an injured

Buffalo front. The defense didn’t
impress anyone, but trading star
corner Tim McKyer to Atlanta
wasn’t the move that division
titles are made of.

Our knowledge here likes the
fact that the Colts have a much

better shot at starting off 0-2 than ‘

Miami does. The Dolphins racked
up 31 points at Buffalo, so we can
expect a- similar show against
Indy. The Colts are staring down
the barrel of a loaded gun.’ Take
Miami -8. I

New Orleans Saints at Kansas
City Chiefs (-6 1/2).

By Rob Pugliese

' The Pitt News .

The School Boys came out hot
with Casey Weldon last week,

i . going 3-0 in spectacular fashion.

This week our three selections

.. feature some of the baddest
squads in the nation. But first, the
‘Panthers, 1-0, take on a tough

‘ squad looking to kill another

giant.

Southern Mississippi at Pitt (-
6.)

The Golden Eagles enter this

game as one of the nation's best-

kept secrets, despite the fact that
they have pulled a number of
major upsets recently. In 1989
they travelled to Tallahassee and
knocked off Florida State. Last
season their 8-4 record included
a 27-24 victory over Alabama, a
13-12 victory over Auburn, a 25-
13 victory over Louisville and a
trip to the All-American Bowl.
Impressive stuff.

Yes, they did lose quarterback
Brett Favre to the NFL, but they

have plenty of talent returning.
Seven starters return on both sides
of the ball, and there are tons of
speed on this club. Last week
they beat mighty Delta State 25-7,
but we can’t really take much
from that. On offense look for
plenty of calls for tailback Tony
Smith, who averaged 134.6 all-
purpose yards~last season and
ranked ninth in the nation as a
punt returner. -

On defense, the Eagles were
stingy, allowing only 12.8 points
per game. They start 10 seniors,
including linebackers Arnie
Williams and Thad McDowell.
There are no glaring weaknesses
here. The defense will have to
carry them, because last year the
Eagles ranked 102nd in Division
I in scoring. Quarterback Eric
Estes went down early in last
week’s game, so redshirt first-
year player Tommy Waters took
over '

The Pitt defense looked very
mean against WVU, as we
predicted. Linebackers Charles
Williams, Tom Tumulty and

 

    
   
   

Ricardo McDonald gave the
Mounties nightmares that they
won’t soon forget. All in all, it was
a very solid effort. On offense,
the line dominated more and
more as the game wore on, and
Jermaine Williams danced for 74
yards on 16 carries. He and Glenn
Deveaux both had fine all-around
performances.

Look for a tough, hard-fought

— battle that could be decided by

mistakes and special teams.
Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?
Southern Miss fumbled the ball
eight times against Delta State,
losing three, and with the new
quarterback, the Panthers could
feast. ” However we can’t
underestimate the overall team
speed of this club. Pitt has been
burned too many times by similar
opponents. The Eagles will not
allow much yardage, but if Pitt
keeps the penalties and turnovers
down like I they did at
Morgantown, that would go a
long way in easing the task. The
Eagles covered the spread all
three times as a road ‘dog last

year, while Pitt was only 2-4
versus the line as a home favorite.
We’ll buck that trend. In a tough
call, we’re hot, and We’ll let the
Panthers ride with us. Take Pitt

Now let’s rumble with the
heavyweights 

Thursday — Tennessee (-7 1/
2) at Louisville.

Two big winners of New Year’s
Day bowl games clash on ESPN’s
inaugu ralThu rsday- night pigskin
fest. Howard Schnellenberger’s
Louisville squad is coming off the
finest season in school history,
not to mention a 34-7 thrashing
of Alabama in the Fiesta Bowl.
But departed are quarterback

Browning Nagle and seven.

defensive starters, including tackle
Ted Washington, who was chosen
in the first round of the NFL draft.

The Cardinals (1-0) are still
loaded at the skill positions, with
wideouts Fred Jones (173 yds./
rec.) and Greg Brohm, as well as
versatile fullback Ralph Dawkins,
who last season became the first
first-year player to ever lead

Louisville in rushing. The new
quarterback isjef f Brohm, brother
of Greg.

The Cards will have a tough A

secondary led by free safety Ray
Buchanan, who was the defensive
MVP in the Fiesta Bowl. But there
will be a large'drop—off in the
front seven and a weak pass
rush. They will have their hands
full with the orange crush.

The Vols come in ranked 13th
and are absolutely loaded on
defense. Tenstarters return from
the devastating unit that allowed
only 144 yards per‘ game through
the air. The linebacking corps is
ferocious, with Ernest_ Fields,
Daryl Hardy and Shon Walker,
who combined for 317 stops a
year ago. The secondary gets
props around the nation, led by
free safety all-American Dale
Carter and all-SEC cornerjeremy
Lincoln. _ V

On offense, the Vols return five
starters from a team that averaged
37 points per game, including
seven games of 40 or more points.

Quarterback Andy Kelly threw ¢‘

for 2,300 yards and 14 TDs. Also
returning is all-American wideout
Carl Pickens, who may be the
finest receiver in school history,
and he knows it. While the
offensive line is immature, the
special teams are superb, led by

Continued from page P-7

The Saints’ defense looked
anything but holy in yielding 502
aerial yards to Seattle’s Dave Krieg
in their 27-24 victory last Sunday.
The Seahawks passed so
effectively that they made
absolutely no effortlat all to run
the ball. New Orleans will be in
for a totally different style of ball
this week, as the Chiefs will shove
battering ram Christian Okoye
down their throats. The Nigerian
Nightmare rolled forI143 yards
on 22 carries against a tough
Atlanta club last week.

Everyone loves to talk about
Kansas City’s secondary, the best
in the NFL, but let’s forget about
them for a second. What about
this front seven? Wake up. Derrick
Thomas is taking over this place.
Right now we’d take him over
any blitzing linebacker in football.
Dino Hackett and Chris Martin
are underrated, but not for long.
Neil Smith, Bill Maas and Dan
Saleaumua amass a dominating
three—man pass rush that most
teams can’t get with five or six
guys rushing. A

again an area of concern since
the trade of holdout CB Robert
Massey to the Cardinals. Safety
Vencie Glenn, acquired from the
Raiders, could make receivers
think twice about going over the
middle. Morten Andersen is a

I fine placekicker.

John Robinson is hoping to
have his ‘Los Angeles Rams
improve upon last year’s
disappointing 5-11 mark. This
team has not been the same since
itc 50-3 loss in the 1990 NFC
Championship game. There will
be drastic changes, as Jeff Fisher
has been brought in from
Philadelphia to coordinate the
defense; switching to a 4-3 and
emphasizing pressure on the
passer.

Buddy Ryan's attack-style
defense works, as does any
defense, when it has the proper
personnel to employ it. That is
the problem facing the Ram
defense: personnel. The only
potentially dominant player in
Los Angeles’ front seven is Kevin
Greene, who is switching from
OLB to DE. Hopefully for the
Rams, he will adapt to his new
position quickly. The Rams need
to overhaul their defense to make

 this style work. Rookie CB Todd

Lyght and S Pat Terrell will make
the secondary a good one in the
future.

Scoring will not be a problem
in LA. In fact since offensive
coordinator Ernie'Zampese came
over from the Chargers, the
resemblance is scary. Like the
early ’80s Chargers, the Rams are
all O and no D. QB Jim Everett
will continue to sling bullets
behind a wall of offensive
lineman. Wide receivers Henry
Ellard and Flipper Anderson are
good bi g—play targets. Everett will
also hand off to a stable of backs
that includes RBS Cleveland Gary,
Robert Delpino and Marcus
Dupree. (7-9, as there is
improvement. But theRams are
not where they want to be.)

abandon the run last week, as
they and Seattle put up a

memorable shootout. If they try
that this week, forget it. New
Orleans must establish some
semblance of a running game in
order to keep the Chiefs’ deadly
rush at bay. The thoughts of
Thomas and Company teeing off
on Bobby Hebert make us cringe.

We love Kansas City’s defense,

and the ball-control offense
should wear out the Saints. New
Orleans was just lucky enough to
escape with the W against Seattle.

Saints fans should just hope that
Hebert leaves Arrowhead Stadium
in one piece, without an arrow

through his head. Take Kansas
City -6 1/2.

Chicago Bears (-2 1/2) atTampa
Bay Bucs. The Buccaneers lost a
hard—fought 16,-15 game against
the New York Jets last week.
New coach Richard Williamson
is hoping that this will be the year
that Vinny T estaverde finally plays
like a quarterback. Not likely,
however. Vinny, c’mon. You have
Mark Carrier, Gary Anderson and
rookie sensation Lawrence
Dawsey to work with. In his
defense, the Bucs’ line gave up
the third—most sacks in all of
football.

If Keith McCants and Broderick

Thomas don’t blossom as
expected, there will be big trouble
in the Bay. McCants had a huge
day last week, but remember, it
was the Jets.

The Bears have one of the
marquee backs in the league with
Neal Anderson, and the Bucs
have problems stopping the run.
Look for Chicago’s huge line to
trample Tampa’s front seven, and
by the fourth quarter, this game
should be under control for the
Bears. Richard Dent and Trace
Armstrong form one of the finest
pairs of defensive ends anywhere.
Fresh blood has arrived in the
form of rookie tackle Chris Zorich

and newly acquired Eric

Kumerow. Mike Singletary and I,

Mark Carrier are superstars at
their respective positions.

Don’t expect to see much
scoring in this game. After all,Jim
Harbaugh is an average
quarterback, and the Bears lack
much of the killer instinct that
they used to possess. In addition,
Tampa Bay always plays better
early in the season. However
Dent is still as dominant as ever,

and he’ll have a feast on Sunday. _

Testaverde will be more than
well done. We absolutely love
this line. In our pick of the week,

Pittsburgh fans rejoice — Brister to return

Speaking on subjects ' one
knows nothing about and having
people believe it is an art form,
butI am still drawing stick ﬁgures.
Should that stop me? Probably.
Will it? Not a chance.

0First of all, Bubby Brister is
the Steeler’s starting quarterback
and deserves to be. There is not
a better quarterback on the roster,
including Neil O’Donnell. In time,
O’Donnell will challenge Brister,
but he is not ready. The game

~ against the Chargers has started

the discussion again. O’Donnell’s
supporters forget how well Brister
played, getting the team a 19-3
lead; They forget how bad their
hero looked until his last pass.
Yes, that pass went for an 89-
yard touchdown, but it was the
speed of receiver'Dwight Stone
and a great block by Louis Lipps

that m_ade that happen. The throw
was one any NFL quarterback
should make easily.

Worse yet is the Steeler fans
cheering the fact that O’Donnell
would have to replace Brister
due to an injury. No matter who
is hurt or how popular the
replacementis, cheering an injury
is a very low-class move. Years
ago Steeler fans cheered an injury
to Terry Bradshaw because they
knew that the more popular Terry
Hanratty would enter the game.
Yet again, Steeler fans have
disgraced themselves.

Linebacker David Little hasn’t
done that, but he has definitely
made a mistake. His long holdout
followed by reports that when he,
finally came to camp, he was out
of shape could put his job in
jeopardy. Yes, he is an

Ryan
Buncher

outstanding player, and the Pro-
Bowl recognition he got last year
was long overdue, but he is also
33 years old. Jerry Olsavsky, who
is starting in Little’s place, is 24
and a very solid player. Rod
Woodson could afford a long
holdout because he is young and
irreplaceable. Neither is true of
Little.

One more thing needs to be
said on the Steelers. For the last
time, NO MORE RUNNING
PLAYS ON THIRD AND LONG!
THEY NEVER WORK! That is not

good as Barry Foster and Merril
Hoge are, neither of them
resembles Harris.

0The Pirates ﬁnally made the
rumored trade for third baseman
Steve Buechele. About the time it
became apparent that Jeff King
would not return any time soon,
John Wehner was showing he
was ready to take his place. Now
that Wehner is hurt, the
possibilities include Bobby
Bontilla moving back there and
juggling assorted bench‘ players
in right field or Curtis Wilkerson.
Neither will bring visions of
Brooks Robinson to mind, and
the offense would have also
suffered, but the price paid for
Buechele could be very dear.
Texas has already received last
year's top Pirate pick, pitcher
Kurt Miller. The player to be

’ named later is rumored to be

pitcher Hector Fajardo. That is
worrisome. He could be ready to
step into the Pirate rotation as
soon as next year, and a
replacement for battered and
aging veteran Bob_Walk is a
must. -

A power pitcher would also be

-as Steelers' signal caller

a good change of pace to go
along with the current Pirate staff
which is last in thejleague in
strikeouts.

If it is any other prospect, the
deal is well worth it, as Buechele
is excellent defensively and a
solid hitter. Never mind the fact
that he will probably leave as a
free agent after the season. In
that way it is similar to the A’s
pick-up ofWillie McGee last ygar
to fill in for an injured Dave
Henderson, and he helped them
reach the World Series.

-The Larry Doughty is Using the
Waiver Wire Again award goes to
the Milwaukee Bucks. They
ended last season with a very old
front line. They drafted a good
young big man in 6—foot, 10-inch
forward Anthony Avent of Seton
Hall, but he is going to play in

- Italy because the ‘Bucks couldn’t
fit him under the salary cap. They V

would have had no problem with
thesalary cap if not for the big-
money contract they gave 36-
year-old center Moses Malone.

That is a personnel move worthy.

Grbac threw 21 touchdown passes and
completed 58.3 percent of his passes last
season for the second-ranked Wolverines.
Wideout Desmond Howard was on the
receiving end 63 times, totaling 1,025
yards and 11 touchdowns.
Michigan has the best offensive line in
college football, easy. Four starters return,
_including 522—pound, all-American Greg
Skrepenak and center Matt Elliot. The
Wolves racked up a 715 yards rushing in
their Gator Bowl massacre of Mississippi.
Sophomore Ricky Powers will make fans
forget Jon Vaughn by the time the
Wolverines finish smashing Notre Dame
next weekend.
The defensive front seven will dominate

opponents almost as easily as the offensive
line. The secondary returns only one starter,
but it won’t be tested until meeting Florida
State on September 28.

Boston College was 0-3 against the
spread as a home underdog last year.
Michigan covered the spread three out of
four times as a road favorite. We’re looking
at a legitimate blowout here. Look for this
game to be over by halftime and the
Wolverines to be well-rested for Notre

Most teams would collapse if their

season in spring practice. But that will not
be the case with the 3rd-ranked

Pitt and Penn State went to a fifth
game. Under new»NCAA rules
that game was played under a
rally score.

4-; Unfortunately nobody knew if
there was another new rule calling
for a 17-point cap, but the officials
didn't know if that was for the
first four games or the fifth one.
The head official, who looked
and officiated like a retired Maytag

I repairman, was upset - but what
about the players? They are

match, and the refs don’t,even
know the rules.

Maybe if the NCAA rules were
comprehensible to anybody other
than the warped minds that made
them_ up, they wouldn’t be
violated as much.

«I have been advised in the past ‘

that a column should be ended
strongly as sort of a reward for

reading the story, but something ,

else comes to mind - no matter
how many other people have
said it, how many times they
have said it or how trite it is.
Best wishes to Penguin Coach
Bob Johnson. Don’t worry about

12.15 I A 

 

garbage time last year but will have the
luxury of an outstanding supporting cast.
The pressure on the offense is not
pressing because of the”Purple Haze”
defense. Six starters are back from the
suffocating unit that held opponents to 67
yards rushing and 13.6 points per game.
They are led_ by all-American tackle Steve
Emtman, a leading candidate for the
Outland and Lombardi awards. .

Last year Washington was a 7-point
favorite at Stanford and rocked them by a
52-16 count. In a rare PAC—10 opener, our
guess is that an improved Stanford club

will keep it much, closer, but that" .1

Washington’s defense will be too much
for Milburn and the Cards. Take
Washington -7 1/2.
