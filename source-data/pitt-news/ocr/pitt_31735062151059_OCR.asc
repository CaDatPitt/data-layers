Pitt students are going to, con-
tribute to the relief of the starving
coal miners of the Western Penn-
sylvania district. A plan of r-e-lief
that will mean no great sacriﬁce to
any student has been worked out
and has received the sanction of
leading student organizations, in-
cluding the Pitt Weekly, Panhell-
enic Association, Interfraternity
Council, Student Council. and the

\ Y, M. and Y. W. C. .1. groups.

The plan is this. «Students, will
be asked to bring to the campus
during the next two weeks discard-
ed clothing and foodstuffs which
will be collected and distributed by
student groups among the various
mining camps’ in the coal ﬁelds of
Allegheny and Washington coun-

 sides of its

meeting yesterday on the ques-
tion, “Resolvedz That undergrad-

held the affirmative side of the ques-

Miss Theresa Kahn, women’s de-
bate coach, in commenting upon
the debate yesterday said: “The
purpose of debating at Pitt is not
only to discuss questions with
ot.her...cg,lleges, _,and to. bring impor-
tant topics to the attention of civic
organizations in the city by means
of exten ion debates, but also to
assist an campus organization
which is interested in having both
problems discussed
fairly and adequately.

Genevieve Blatt, Col. ’33, presi-
dent of the Women's Debating As-
sociation, announces that two
home debates have been scheduled
for the coming season. One is with
Ohio Wesleyan University, and
will take place _February 16, and
the other-is with.George Washing-

to help the women on the staff pub-

Replacing the men on the usual

Will . Reappear

Realizing the need for a maga-
zine devoted entirely to creative
writing, a group of faculty members
and students will present to the
campus on December 14 the ﬁfth
issue of “Steps,” University liter-
ary publication. The last issue of
“Steps” was published in December,
1929.

In commenting on the forthcom-
ing issue of the publication, Pro-
fessor Percival Hunt, head of the
Department of English, said, “I
think “Steps" is a pretty good repre-
sentation of what we have been
doing around here in narration and
verse. It represents. work done
from theiﬁrst year student up to
the graduate student. It is not pre-
tentious; we do not want it to
seem pretentious. It is Just that
people who are trying to write are
ﬁnding a. way of expression."

The new issue, which is being
sponsored by the English depart-
ment will contain shqrt stories,
poetry, narrative paragraphs and
other literary features. Those in
the English department who have
selected the material are Frederick
P. Mayer, assistant professor, Fred-
erick J. Gilsdorf, Edwin Peterson.
and Jennings Hammer. instructors.

The publication will be on sale
at several points on the campus
and at downtown book shops for

.25 cents. Theodore Savage, Col.

’32, and William Theis, Col. ’33,

Women will be excused

from ﬁfth hour classes by the

At Assembly

lBruce Bairnsfather To
Speak Here Wednesday

 

 

The narrative of the comic side
of the World War will be present-
ed by Bruce Bairnsfather, famous
British war humorist and cartoon-
ist, at the second student assembly
of the year to be held in Memorial
Hall at eleven-thirty next Wednes-
day. Fourth hour classes will be
eliminated in order that students
and faculty might hear Mr. Balms-
father.

Bairnsfather will speak on “The
Romance of a Cartoonist.” His ad-
dress will be illustrated with stere-
opticon views and original chalk
cartoons. He is expected to depict
the humorous side of the war and
recreate his famous cartoon “The
Better ’Ole."

Mr. Bairnsfather gathered the

front, in the ranks of the British
regular army. His cartoons ap-
peared during the darkest days of
the war in most parts of the world
and it is said that Captain Bairns-
father was the man “who made the
world laugh during its darkest mo-
ments."

Titled Visitors Tour
Cathedral of Learning

The Cathedral’ of Learning was
visited by two distinguished guests
recently. The Countess Margit
Bethlen, wife of the former Prime

Minister of Hungary, visited here_

last week. The Countess was
taken to the top of the Cathedral
and was also shown the pictures
and plans of the Hungarian Room.

Sir Harry Brittain, speaker at
Founder’s Day at the Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology, was also a
visitor at the Cathedral. Sir Harry
went to the top of the Cathedral
and looked in at the English room.

The latest development in the
Cathedral is the professor's chair
for the Russian room, designed by
Dr. Andrey Avinoff, assistant pro-
fessor of Fine Arts. The chair
was carved and ﬁnished by the
Robert W. Irwin Company of Grand
Rapids, and will be left in Mrs.
Mitche1l’s office until the comple-
tion of the Russian room.

That “The Navy League. in 30‘

while at the time of making

In the Nation, Professor Wil-
liams concludes that a. group such
as The Navy League seems to be
an inevitable hangover from the

days of armed commerce. "Since
the World War the doctrine has
become a cast-off of historiog-
raphy,” he declares.

Dr. Williams has made an ex-
pert study of America’s disarma-
ment policy. “The United States
and Disarmament,” one of his
books of recent publication, sets
forth a course which this country
should pursue. In “Economic
Foreign Policy of the United
States," Professor Williams points
out the“ two policies from which
America must choose. The ﬂrst is
to revert to the sea power theory
of history, and to extend our com-
merce under the muzzles of war-
ship cannons. The second one.
which Professor Williams favors,
is to use methods of paciﬁc com-
merce mutual conﬁdence and co-
operative diplomacy.

the conditions he found there. Ac-
cording to Mr. Ma.rchbin_ families

“I believe that Pitt students
have the opportunity to take the
initiative in this work without un-
dergoing any great personal sacri-
ﬁces,” Mr. Marchbin said. “Every
student must have some article of
clothing which he no longer needs,
but which would protect some un-
fortunate member of the mining
communities. Fraternity houses
can do their share by collecting dis-
carded clothing of their members.”

by Camels, is something smokers have discovered as
better than anything they ever tried before.

Dr. M. K. McKay Attends

Washington Conference

 

Dr. Marion K. McKay, professor
of economics, left Pittsburgh on
Wednesday for Washington, D. C.,
where he is attending the Confer-
ence on Home Owning and Home
Building, December 2 to 5. Dr.
McKay is a member of Hoover’s
special taxation committee, which
wll make its report to the confer-
ence committee along with 30
other committees composed of
men selected from all over the
country, to report on the various
home issues.

The special tax committee takes
the position that the burden of
taxation on real estate is greater
than it should be -and in the inter-
est of home building and owner-
ship some ways should be found
to lessen the burden.

The committee's objective is to
submit plans for lowering taxes on
real estate. Dr. McKay, in un-
alyzing the steps of his commit-
tee’s report, gives thefollowing:
' 1. Better assessment of other
kinds of property.

2. Reduction of public outlays
wherever possible.

3. Insistence upon
service for the tax dollar.

4. Ildimination of unnecessary
and obsolete governmental agen-
cies and units.

5. Wider use of income taxa-
tion and inheritance taxation.

President Hoover will address
the conference delegates on Fri-
day afternoon and at- the White
House on Friday evening, the sev-
eral hundred members will be re-
ceived by the President.

“Men Should

By MARION L'oR:-:scH
At least one phase of the depres-
sion is being thoroughly studied by
college students today. The whole
controversy was begun by President

George Thomas bf the University
of Utah. when he issued the state-
ment that coeds “should pay
half the expense of ‘dates.’ ’.’ Stu-
dents with the depression complex
all over the country pounced upon
the proposal and now the battle is
on.
Here are the opinions of several
well kn-own girls on the campus:

Enice Natali: “Well, I don’t
think girls should. Poor college
boys should save money from their
allowances by depriving themselves
of cigarettes and other things if
they want to ‘date’ girls.”

Elaine Forak_er: “I don’t think
men really want to go ‘dutch’ be-
cause it makes them feel big-hea.rt-
ed to pay the bill.”

Ruth Malone: “I cannot under-
stand how a girl could conceivably
share an evening’s expenses with
the young man withouta great deal"

can trace the development of educa-

and discuss the lives of her pio-

the native women as it progresses.

Totals $16,000

Professional Schools Are

 

As the campus Welfare Fund
drive neared the end of its extend-
ed campaign period this week, in-
complete reports from the oﬂice Of
W. W. Mendenhall, chairman of

the student division, indicated a to-
tal of approximately $16,000 solicit-
ed within the University, an in-
crease of nearly $4,000 0179!‘ last
Friday's ﬁgure.

The largest group contribution
came from the faculty and employ-
ees, who together contributed $11.-
300. Mellon Institute comes next
with a donation of $2,700, and the
student contribution completes the
total with an estimated amount of
$2,000.

Mr. Mendenhall, commenting on
the student contributions to the
fund, said, “While the general re-
sponse of the student body was
hardly more than ‘fair,’ there were
‘several instances—particularly in
l

the professional schools where the
gindivdual and group contributions
[exceeded all expectations.

“The somewhat disappointing re-
sponse from the students in other
schools was largely the result of
poor solicitation and the absence
of cohesive groups within those
schools.”

The prof.essional schools gave
approximately 45 per cent of the
total contributed by the student
body, Mr. Mendenhall estimated,
with the Dental School having the
greatest number of contributors.
The highest average for individual
contributions was credited to the
Law School, where 69 students gave
$186, an average of almost three
dollars per student.

Included among the individual
contributions of the law students
was one of $50 and another of $25,
in addition to several ﬁve-dollar
and two-d-ollar donations.

The tabulated report for the pro-
fessional schools gave the follow-
ing ﬁgures: Dental School,.$302;
Law School, $210; Medical Schools,
$200, and Pharmacy School, $165.

customer." It has long
ceased to be a game for the stu-
dents of the Research Bureau for
Retail Training who have tempor-
arily given up classroom studies in
House No. 4, Frick Acres, to get
the “practical experience” which is
required as part of the research
program

The majority or the thirteen stu-
dents are in toy departments of
Pittsburgh's leading department
stores where they, among others,
are responsible for the supervision
of salespeople and customer rela-
tions. They see that customers are
waited on; authorize irregular
transactions; arrange the lunch
hours; and handle customer com-
plaints and adjustments. Their du-
ties and responsibilities are innum-
erable, -but the students are not en-
tirely green, for they have served
a selling apprenticeship and are
prepared to assume the duties of
junior executives.

Student supervision is not en-
tirely conﬁned to toys. In some
stores the student is responsible
for more than one department.
When you shop for Christmas
cards, hosiery, leather goods, smok-
»er’s -articles, bags, gloves, jewelry,
stationary. infants we-ar, handker-
chiefs, ties,.shirts, and of course,
toys, you are very likely to be ap-
proached‘ by a. Pitt student if you
have forgotten your coin or if you
choose "to pay by check.

After the Christmas business sea-
son and vacation. classes will again
be resumed and individual
will go forward on the departmental

thesis for M. A. degrees. At the
close of the school year in June,
the students will have had experi-
ence with from three’ to four out-
standing retail ﬁrms.

Frat Bowlers
Open Tuesday

 

 

Eighteen Houses Enroll.

In Three Sections

Interfraternity counci1’s third
competitive event of the year, the
bowling tournament, will begin
Tuesday evening at the Centre-
Neville Bowling alleys.

Five Men Teams.

This year’s tournament will be
run on practically the same basis
as those of the past with the eight-
een fraternities divided into three
sections of six teams apiece. ec-

tion A will bowl on Tuesday nights,
Section B on Wednesdays, and Sec-
tion C on Thursdays.

Each team will meet every other
team in its section in one match of
three games. All three games will
be played, and the ﬁnal sectional
winner will be determined by the
number of games won and lost.

All matches are scheduled to
start at 7‘ o'clock, but teams are
given ten minutes grace in the
event that they are unable to ap-
pear .at the speciﬁed time. If a
team is not present at 7:10 o’clock,
its scheduled opponent is awarded
three victories.

The opening matches on Tuesday

will find Sigma Pi meeting Phi
Gamma Delta, Omega Delta facing
Theta Delta Psi. and Kappa Nu op-
posing Delta Sigma Phi. Wednes-
day's battles will be between Sig-
ma Chi and Kappa Sigma, Phi
Lambda Phi and Delta Tau Delta,
and Phi Delta Theta and Phi Epsi-
lon Pi. The Thursday schedule in-
cludes matches between Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon and Alpha Phi Delta,
Sigma Alpha ‘Mu and Lambda Chi
Alpha, and Theta/Chi and Phi Kap-
pa. ’
The rules are practically the
same as those which have prevail-
ed in the past, ﬁve men rolling for
each team with the total number
of points deciding the winner.
Should a team have less than ﬁve
men present for a game, a substi-
tute score of 75 points per man for
each game will be awarded it.

Fraternities must submit a list
of ten men eligible for the tourna-
ment before Tuesday night. Only
those who have passed twelve
credits during their last previous
semester in school and who are
carrying at least twelve credits this
semester can compete.

Pitt to Open
With Temple

Basket Ballers Prepare
for Western Tour .

The Pitt varsity basketball team
will open its season next week with
Temple University at the Pitt Sta-
dium. This will be the only home
engagement before the team starts
Car1son’s “suicide
campaign.” 4.

The team leaves Pittsburgh, De-
cember 13, for Milwaukee to en-
gage the University of Wisconsin.
From there they will travel
through and meet teams in Indi-
ana, Kansas, Colorado, and Califor-
nia. They return home about
January 7.

Team Conﬁdent

A great deal of comment has
been passed on the schedule for
this year and Dr. Carlson has been
criticized severely for attempting
to play thirteen games in fifteen
days. However, both the coach
and the team are conﬁdent that
they will have a successful season.

The schedule is composed of
thirty-two games, ranging from the
east coast to the west coast. Such
teams as Syracuse, N. Y. U.;
Georgetown. ‘Navy, Penn, and ‘Har-
vard will show the most opposition
in the East. On the western tour
Pitt will meet several sectional

 

 

champions, including the Univer-

sity of Wisconsin winner of nine
out of twelve sectional champion-
ships; Butler College, leaders in
the Indiana hotbed; the University
of Colorado, champions of the east-
ern section of the Rocky Mountain
division; and Washington Univer-
sity' Pacific Coast champions.
Ten Travel

Dr. Carlson expects to take at
least ten members of the squad to
the west. The loss of Bus Al-
bright was an upset but Ochsen-
hirt, with Smith as a relief man, is
expected to ﬁll up the vacancy
competently. Barring unlooked-for
developments the probable line-
up for the opener will be: Lawry

and W. Kowallis, co-captains at thel

forward posts; Ochsenhirt at cen-
ter, and Smith and McCamant at
guards.

By. HELEN WEIDELI

By trouncing the husky Ne-
braskans on Thanksgiving, the
Golden Panthers completed one of
the most successful seasons in Dr.
“Jock” Sutherland’s eight years as
Pitt mentor, and lay claim to the
Eastern Championship. In defeat-
ing such important teams as Iowa,
Army, and Nebraska they have

achieved national fame.

is credited to Notre Dame, unde- 
feated for three seasons. The
Mid-westerners won 25-12. Penn.‘
State was smothered 41-6 for
the tenth time in as many years.

The Panthers then annexed the
City championship again by edging
over Carnegie Tech, 14-6. The
game did not come up to the ex-
pectations of national interest;
but to local fans who realize the
keen rivalry existing between-the
two teams, the score was satis-

Schricker Returns
College Meet

With the entrance of Angelo

Uniontown Junior college for the
college boxing championships and
the return of Jack Schricker, var-
sity 160-p«ounder_ since the close of
the football season, the makeup. Of
the Pit-t mitt squad is rapidly tak-
ing shape, and Coach Orsini hopes
to have a full line on his candi-
dates after the championships at
the stadium on Thursday night,
December 17

vS*everal‘~members of the football
squad are expected to report next
week unless the Panthers receive
the bid to play in the Tournament
of Roses football game with South-
ern California in which event, they
will not be available until next sem-
ester. .

Coach Explains Rules

Coach Orsini took time out from
practice during the past week to
instruct the ﬁghters in the inter-
collegiate rules for boxing which
differ greatly from the A. A. U. and
the professional requirements.

The referee is the sole judge of
the winner of all bouts. No noise
is allowed during a ﬁght; and if
any is made, the referee can stop
the bout until such disturbances
cease and award points to the op-
posing boxer. I

Fouls are called for hitting below
the belt, hitting an opponent who is
down or getting up after being
down. holding or deliberately hold-
ing an opponent in a clinch, hold-
ing and hitting with one hand,
pushing, butting, or using the knee,
“flicking” with the open hand,
wrestling or roughing at the ropes,
going down without being hit, use
of abusive or insulting language,
and failure to obey the referee.

Point System

The referee picks the winner on
the basis of points. Fourteen points
are given for the oﬁense -and de-
fense. Offense covers clean- hits,
aggressive action. well delivered
hits. The defense covers blocking,
making an opponent miss, balance
and readiness to counter attack.
Four points are awarded for ring
generalship. Points deducted for
stalling, going down without being
hit, covering up with the hands so
that the opponent is not in a posi-
tion to hit, clinching, hitting an
opponent while holding him.

BUILDING

How DYNAMITE
breaks the way
for famous Insurance
Company’s new
structure

NOTHER skyscraper
 joins New York’s myriad .
towers. It is _a new_ oﬁice build-
ing ‘for the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company.

Once more "architects have designed
a modern structure of beauty and
symmetry. Once more engineers and
builders have turned architects’ plans
into actuality. And once more Dyna-
mite was first onithe job to blast out
some 70,000 yards of rock so that the

foundation might be pIaced.

Dynamite is the ally of the modern
engineer. It is the tool without which
(‘=.ll‘PfllIIy designed plans for many

hr-mic undertakings would never be
- more than paper plans.

tains, rivers and cities. Bridges and

The Tech Tartans are “given a
slight edge over the Duke Night-
Riders in the benefit-game to be
played at the Pitt Stadium tomor-~
row. Both teams have lost five
games which establishes a new rec-
ord in the histories of Coach Wally
Steﬂen and Coach Elmer Layden.

Tech will be depending largely
on Kavel and Armentrout for gains
through the Duke line. The boys
from the Bluff have been practic-
ing for the past week with the de-
fensive system, using Tech plays.
and with the forward passing com-
bination of Bud De Vinney to “Cow-
boy” Al De Luca. This will be the
first time that Duquesne has played
a. team from Pittsburgh, although
they are scheduled to play Pitt next
year. The entire gate receipts will
be turned over to the Welfare
Fund. The stadium, the assistants,
and the tickets have been,donated_—
by the Pitt Athletic department

W. Don Harrison, Pitt director of
athletics, is chairman of the ticket
committee. Reserved" seats will sell
for $1.50; general admission will be
$1.00, and the students from Tech,
Duquesne and Pitt can purchase-
tickets in special sections for $.50.

Both Dr. John B. Sutherland,
coach of the Pitt team. and Dr.
John G. Bowman, Chancellor of the
University, are on the general com-
mittee.

J ‘ ' ‘ the football teams of Car-

versity will. meet at the Pitt
Stadium in a «beneﬁt game for

. the»: unemployed of Allegheny

That this game will be a

not only by the interest being
shown by the general public,
but also by allthose taking
part in the game, players. offi-
’cials, newspapermen, radio an-

their services but are pur-
chasing admission tickets as
well. . .,..

City couniiil in its regula
session Monday passeda reso-
lution endorsing the beneﬁt
and urging its members as-well
as the general public to be
generous.

The fact that this is the first
time that Tech» and- Duquesne
meet on the gridiron should
make the game an exciting one
and should add to its interest
among city football fans. ‘
