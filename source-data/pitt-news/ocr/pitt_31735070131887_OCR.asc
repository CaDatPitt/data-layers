_ A Staff Report
After only six months in her position,
Fraternity and Sorority Life Coordinator
Anita Triggs has resigned
“I wasn’t expecting a resignation

because there haven’t been any forewarn-

ings ﬂiat this was going to occur,” said
Lindsay Woods, the president of Pitt’s
Panhellenic Association. ‘ -

“It’s really odd,” said Steve Mihlfried,
the Interfraternity Council president, com-
menting on the unexpected‘nature of Triggs’
resignation.

“I was surprised that this happened this
quickly, and it makes me think ﬂrat there was
something more to it,” he added

Although Tuesday was Triggs’ last day

.in the office, Associate Dean of Student

Affairs, Bimey Harrigan would not say
when Triggs gave notice of her resignation.

“She was not asked to resign,” Harrigan
explained. “[Triggs’ reasons for resigning]
are personal matters that I can’t discuss,” she
said, declining to comment. .

While the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs will

not appoint‘ an interim Greek adviser,

I Harrigan will take “direct responsibility for

leadership of Greek  _

“I haven’t been as immediately
involved with the student organizations as
the fraternity and sorority coordinator has
been, obviously,” Harrigan said. “But I
expect to get to know them as I work close-
ly with them in the months ahead”

Ron ‘Coursey, president of Pitt’s

-National Pan—Hellenic Council, said that he

does not see the absence of a Greek adviser
asa major setback to Greek life.

“I think that, for the most part, the three
councils are pretty much se1f—governing,” he
said, describing the strength of Pitt’s three
Greek councils. ‘

“Without an adviser, however, the lead-
ers of the Greek councils will have “no direct
voice to the University,” he added While an

adviser can act as a facilitator between stu— '

dents and university ofﬁcials, he said stu-
dents frequently must go through a number
of people to be heard. ' A

Harrigan also declined to comment on
Triggs’ ability to communicate with student
leaders and members of the Greek "commu-
nity, explaining the students would be in a
better position to respond.

“For her to dive in with only one year of
experience, I think that was a little much,”
Mihlfried said “I. think that communication
between Anita and IFC was established, but
it could have been better.”

The leaders of the 'other Greek councils
echoed Mihlfried’s response. ‘

“We had some struggles with her as an
administrator,” Woods added

Coursey spoke well of Triggs’ treatment

Greek adviser resigns from position

of the Greek community, but agreed that she I

might have been able to better improve com-
munications between the councils and. the
administration. ’

“Ithink she wasfair, as far as facilitating '

between us’ and the University,” Coursey
said “I do feel like there were times when
the communication could have been 

Harrigan added that she had received
“no direct complaints from students” regard-
ingvTriggs.

“The fact that Anita was selected for the
position speaks to the. expectation that she
would be an asset in respect to what we were
trying to do with ‘ﬂue Greek community,”

-Harrigan said

Hanigan said that Pitt would initiate a
national _search for a new adviser immedi-
ately, and that she was working on forming a«
list of desired qualities for the candidates.

Pitt professor researching the causes of suicide

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

About 30,000 people end their own
lives in the United States each year, accord-
ing to the American Association of
Suicidology, and up to 760,000 people are
estimated to make attempts.

Among American youth aged 15 to 24,
it ranks as the third most common cause of
death, claiming almost 4,000 lives a year.

For Dr. David Brent, these numbers
mean that suicide, and its accompanying
behavior, deserves much closer investiga-
tion than it has received in the past.

Brent is the Professor of Psychiatry,

Pediatrics, and Epidemiology for the
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic and
serves as a professor of psychiatry at Pitt’s
School of Medicine.

On Nov. 25, 2003, Provost James
Maher named him the inaugural endowed
chair in suicide studies. It was a ﬁrst—of—its—
kind position, providing Brent with valuable
frmding for research into a subject that he
described that day as “easy to avoid, because
the act of suicide goes against the thing we
hold most dear: the preciousness of life.”

Former Surgeon General Dr. David
Satcher, reports by the Institute of Medicine
and the National Institute of Mental Health
all call for the creation of suicide research

centers, drawing attention to the subject in
the medical community. During a recent
interview Brent said that research in the ﬁeld
today, while valuable, is still very conserva-
tive in its aims. A ‘ '

“For the most  the way  review
works is that they want to bet on things that
are pretty sure things, and that tends to be not
that irmovative,” he said. “Therefore, it’s
great that [Pitt] has that kind of «faith in me,
because what it allows me to do is to some‘-
times bet on my instincts and do something
that is a little more. out of the box.”

Such “out of the box” thinking includes
investigations not only into known risk fac-
tors, such as mood disorders, but also focus-

ing on the familial and genetic aspects of sui-

cide and how such behaviors are passed
down. Brent said that he has found there to I

be a vulnerability to suicidal behavior that

can’t be explained away by mood disorders A

alone. A history of trauma in a family and a
difﬁculty in regulating emotions and aggres-
sion are large factors as well. 4
“So, somebody is sad, they may have
thoughts about suicide, but with this addi-
tional vulnerability they may be more likely
to actually do something,” he said. “Some of
it is probably genetic, some not. But if we
can understand more about that, then we
may be able to prevent the onset in ﬂre next
generation.” « W
Building on these ﬁndings, Brent is cur-
rently using ﬂre ﬁnancial clout of his newly
endowed chairmanship to fund a unique
study in Israel; The study involves inter-

viewing and  genetic samples from '

people in a large extended family, all of
whom live in a village there that happens to

have a high rate of suicide.

According to Brent, the road to focus-

ing on this population segment. was ﬁrst‘
paved by the children he ‘saw during his.
training at Children’s Hospital in the late

l970’s who had intentionally overdosed on

drugs. Following a 200 percent
increase in suicide rates between the l950’s'
and the l970’s among Americans aged 15 to

24, according to the AAS, there was stabi-

lization or slight decrease in those rates in

recent decades, with 13.2 deaths per

100,000 people in 1990 compared to 9.9 per

lO0,0()0 in 2001. But Brent thinks that the

depression that causes suicidal thoughts is a

much larger problem. _

“Ten per 100,000 means it’s very hard

to ﬁnd the people you really think are at I

risk,’,’ he said. “You need to identifypeople
who have other problems, you know, alco-
hol problems or depression, even if they
aren’t going to commit" suicide, they still
need help.” -
According to the AAS, in 2001
Pennsylvania had 1,276 reported deaths by
suicide with a rate of 10.4 deaths per
100,000 people, which is slightly below the

Greeks wantto be involved

Greek, page 1

“Whatsets Pitt apart from other ir1stitu-
tions . . . is that we have_to be cognizant that
we’re an urban institution,” Hanigan said.

Before being hired by Pitt, Triggs
served as assistant director of fraternity and
sorority life at ‘Penn State. When Triggs
began working at Pitt on July 1, 2003, the
University had been without a Greek advis-
er for 10 months,.after former Greek adviser
Sharon Malazich resigned in October 2002
to take a position outside the University.

,“Changes are ongoing,” Harrigan said,
addressing ﬂre turnover rate of Greek advis-
ers and other administrators in Student

“The students took part in ﬂre develop-
ment of criteria for selecting candidates for
the position,” Harrigan said, addressing her
statement after former Malazich resigned,
that the selection process would involve
“signiﬁcant student input’ ’ and would “have
them involved completely,” according to an
October 2002 report in The Pitt News.

‘They also screened the applications
and provided input,” Harrigan added. “I’m
going to have them interview the candidates
[this time].”

Greek leaders also professed interest in
being involved in the application process.

“Hopefully, they will take our recom-
mendations seriously,” Mihlfried said

“Timing is very, very important for
recruiting,” Harrigan explained “This isthe
recruiting period for candidates.”

Recruiting a replacement for Malazich

_ was more diﬂicult, Harrigan "said, because

Malazich resigned in October — an undesir-
able time of year for ﬁnding adviser candi-
dates, according to Harrigan.

“Even the candidates that we had invit-
ed, they had offers from other positions
before we got to them,” Harrigan said.

As a result, the-candidates whose appli-
cations were reviewed by Greek leaders
were not viable candidates when Student
Alfairs was "ready to hire someone, Hanigan
explained. 1

“Anita emerged later in the process,”
Harrigan said “She was not in the pool of
candidates that the st11dents [reviewed] .”

When Malazich resigned, Pitt launched
a careful look at the Greek system. The
University’s ﬁndings were compiled in the
Greek report, a comprehensive set of recom-
mendations compiled by Deborah Furka,
who was at the time director of public safe-
ty. Furka has since moved to the position of
director of residence life. Though adrninis-
trators did not originally intend to make the
report public, they presented a summary of
the Greek report in February 2003* and
announced  to implement suggested
changes. A

“The fraternity and sorority life coordi- -

nator has been leading the implementation
eifort,” Harrigan said, adding that she will
assume responsibilities for making changes,
in accordance with the report recommenda-
tions, until the appointment of a permanent
adviser. I

The greatest change to have come about
because of the Greek report concerns the

way in which Pitt deals with complaints ﬁled.

by Greeks, Harrigan said While the Greek
community still deals with minor problems,
major issues now go to the judicial board,
instead of to Harrigan, as they used to.

. “One of the reasons that we did [the
Greek report] was to see how we can make
the Greek system exemplary,” Harrigan
said. “It was good, but we want it to be
exemplary.” '

“And that required change,” Harrigan
added, “both in the Greek advising staff —
and that was Anita, as fraternity and sorority.
life coordinator — and in the Greek system.”

“Right now we are working on stan-
dards of excellence,” Harrigan said of
upcoming changes. “The students are very
committed,” she added ‘They want to excel

that we .” ' .

According to Brent, cultural changes

An example of this can be found in
groups like the Native Americans, who have
the highest overall suicide rate of any ethnic
group in the United States.

Brent is also set to do a study that will
look at the psychological and pharmacolog-

Take credit for nutritional McProgress

In accordance with its “Eat
Smart, Be Active” initiative
launched last year, McDonald’s -is
making menu adjustments, includ-
ing phasing out its Supersize fries
and drinks.

McDonald’s spokesman Walt
Riker claimed, “the driving force
here was menu simplification,” and
said that not many Supersize fries
are sold. ’

lt’s great to see McDonald’s
taking steps to bringtheir food
choices down from the hyper-
caloric stratosphere they inhabit
now. However, what’s the harm in
acknowledging that pressure from
obesity lawsuits and Americans’
desire to find healthy choices may
have figured in? Gigantic portions
of unhealthy food are targets of
nutritional watchdog groups, and
they should be. There is no need for
anyone to eat that many deep—fried
potatoes — but when they are deli-
cious, cheap and available, it can be
hard to say no.

McDonald’s seems to want to
bow to pressure, but not admit it’s
bowing. What’s wrong with admit-

ting to culinary sinning, then agree— .

ing to go forth and sin no more‘?
Perhaps McDonald’s wants to
maintain that they were never in the
wrong, and that simple economics
are behind the move, in order to

I

maintain a facade of being a friend-
ly, smiling business that does
what’s right and represents healthy
capitalism. And shaking off the pos-
sibility of a few more personal-
responsibility lawsuits never hurt.
‘Richard Adams, . a former
McDonald’s executive and current
independent consultant, claims the
move is also part of an initiative to
clean up some of the menu “clutter”
that was added during slumping
sales in the late ‘90s. Menu clutter
like the McLean Deluxe didn’t stay
long. Are theirelatively new — and
relatively healthy —.entrée salads

and yogurt parfaits next?‘

It would, be heartening to
assume that all Americans are capa-
ble of just saying no to the offers
that seem to make so much econom-
ic sense -— for just a few pennies
more, you can Giganto-size that
lard—laden meal at most fast-food
places — but it’s often hard to do
that, despite a_rteries hardening at
the mere sight of such a meal.

So it’s great that McDonald’s is
willing to offer a little assistance to
Americans ingrained with Mom’s
“clean your plate” ethos. Good rid-

'dance to «bay-sized jugs of pop;

Now, all McDonald’s needs to do is
admit that Supersize was a bad idea
in the first place, and take credit for
getting rid of it.

Earth Science are faulty at best, I do
know that someone — Copernicus, or

‘maybe Galileo — decided that the
world actually orbited around the sun. '

My speculations began sometime
last May. As the end of senior year
approached, the one question’ every
well—meaning adult felt compelled to
ask me —— where I was going to col-
lege — was always followed with a
smile of recognition and roughly the
same response: '

“Pittsburgh? Really? How funny
— my cousin/daughter/uncle/former
roommate lives/went to school there.”

To someone born and bred in the
Pittsburgh suburbs, this might not be
cause for alarm. Given that I had not
heard a single thing, good or bad,
about this city until my cousin
dragged me out to look at ‘his alma
mater, I found it fairly surprising.
Everyone from my doctor to the
woman who cut my hair seemed to
know someone in Pittsburgh. As it
turned out, I even have a few distant
cousins here. '

As a Pitt commuter, the 61C is

my savior. Every day,.40 minutes to '

campus, 40 minutes from campus —-
except during the endless rush. hour,
when it takes about an hour — it is
my somewhat faithful companion.
We’ve all experienced the trials
of public transportation, and know
that the only way to survive _a long.

bus ride is with a long CD. In the.

four years I’ve been “riding gold,”
I’ve gone through‘ three CD players,
tracling in each for a more compati-
ble model as the shocks on the bus
make listening to arCD‘ more and
more difficult. ‘ D

But, horror of horrors, what hap-
pens when the batteries die? T hat’s
when the people-watching comes in.

I don’t know whether to describe it‘

as frightening or hilarious, but some
days it’s like a live seat‘ at Jerry
Springer without the Jerry beads and
flying, chairs. . _
Have you ever noticed the talk-
ers? I’ve found there to be two
types: the cell phones and the ora-
tors. The cell phones feel the need
to announce their private life to the
entire bus, by holding the speaker of
their phone to their mouth — this is
very important; after all, even
though they’re screaming‘, the per-
son on the other end might not be

‘ On the subject of entertainment,

how about the singers? Those lucky

ducks whose batteries haven’t ran

and ,Mariah Carey. Unfortunately,
they can’t sing like them..You’re sit-
ting there, trying to read your

of a sudden you hear someone
screeching — and butchering —
“Fantasy.” Must be getting ready for

It also seems that you can’t ride
these days without someone trying
to bum fare off you. While annoy-
ing, one of the most entertaining

side of the road.
However, nothing
can possibly beat Ice Pick Man. One
day, I realized I_forgot to change my
batteries rightafter I got on the bus.

‘Two stops after I got on, a large man

got on the bus and sat across from
me. Pimpin’ would be too conserva-
tive a description of him. He was
wearing shoes so white they hurt
your corneas, ‘white fleece sweat-
pants and V-necked sweater "with a
red collared shirt underneath, a red
bowler hat, and he had with him a
cane with a fist at the junction of the
cane and handle.

He walked down the aisle, greet-

ing his -friends from the VA hospital

and encouraging one to go on dis-
ability. He proceeded to tellhim

about the new car his disability
checks were buying him next week.
His friend complimented him on his
cane, and he relayed the story of
how he obtained it.

Turns out, he found a guy down
at .the VA hospital who whittled
these canes. The guy had a cane
similar to his fist cane, but with an
elephant where the fist was. The
vendor warned him it may not hold
his weight, and, sure enough, it
broke within a week. He went back,
and the man_told him he couldn’t get
his money back. So he TOOK OUT
HIS ICE PICK (the one he always
carries) and told him he better
exchange it! He told his buddy to go
see him about getting a cane, and
tell him the fist cane sent him.

Needless to say, I got a seat fur-
ther back as soon as I could.

Don’t get me wrong, I am very
grateful for the coveted Pitt bus
pass. It lends a bit of entertainment
to an otherwise monotonous com-
mute. Now, if they would just do
something about those shocks.

Of course, this ‘discovery will
mean more than simply a point of
pride for Pittsburgh residents — there
are a lot of valuable merchandising
opportunities that come along with
being the center of the universe.
Instead of “Six Degrees of Kevin
Bacon,” people could play “Six
Degrees of‘ Pittsburgh.” Mt.
Washington would be even more note-
worthy if people could take pictures
overlooking the center of the universe.
Being the start and end of all things
hasn’t been easy for the city, and the

- publicity which is sure to follow this

publication is going to present an
additional challenge. I think we’re up
to it, though. All roads don’t lead to

Recommended if you like:_
hardcore-inspired pop-punk

The members of Fall Out Boy, a
punk—pop band based in a Chicago,
call themselves “softcore.” Making
fun of the labels that people try so
hard to put on their music, they came
up with this ‘ description of their
music because of their founder’s his’-
tory._ Bassist Pete Wentz came
straight from another Chicago band,
the hardcore Arma Angelus, and he
left to form Fall Out Boy. He was
sick of how down the hardcore scene
had become in Chicago and was look-
ing for something a little more
upbeat, but still wanted to maintain a
little bit of hardcore with it. What
you have now is “softcore.”

The band is led by the strong lead
vocalist, Patrick Strump. But he start-
ed out as a drummer. As a joke during
the vocalist tryouts, he went up and
sang, and the band realized that he
was exactly what the doctor ordered.

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

Fall ()ut

The bandmates instantly became
best friends and set out to have a
good time. They practiced on the
weekends and would play some gigs
whenever they could. It wasn’t long
before one of their friends recognized
their talent and urged them to contin-
ue the band full-time.

They then decided to go into a
promotions frenzy, playing every gig
that they could get and delivering

their demo to record labels. They‘
started creating such. a buzz, around,

Chicago that record labels started

calling them for their -'demos,”o'nly to_ 
realizethat-they -had 21-’ClCI'l’l'():'g'2_1lI‘_"“‘
along! The band decided '~‘to* settle‘;

with Fueled by Ramen records, and
the end results were Take This to Your
Grave, a tour with punk phenomenon
Mest, and a spot on this year’s

~ Warped Tour.

Take This To Your Grave is a fun,
catchy and hook-filled album. The
band needs to do a littleimore,
though, if they plan to set themselves
apart from the pop-punk bands
attacking the music scene left and
right. Though .they present nothing
fresh ‘or, innovative, the members of
Fall Out Boy do accomplish what

they set out to do — have a good time

playing music that they enjoy.
Standouts on the album include

“Calm. Before the Storm,” a fun,

catchy party song that can definitely’

move a ‘ crowd to its feet, ‘and
“Saturday,” in which you can hear
Wentz’s hardcore influences lurking
in the background. 4 -

Maybe’ the best track on the
album is. “Grand Theft. Autumn
(Where Is Your Boy).” It shows off
Strumpfs vocal talents and ability to

woo the audience. Picture the ’ girls
Swooning as he sings, “Where is your
boy tonight? I hope he is a gentle-
man/Maybe he won’t find out what I
know: you were the last- good thing
about this part of townf’,

If you are looking for fresh and
original talent, set your sights else-
where._ But if you are looking for a
fun pop-punk album to‘ add to your
collection, Take This To Your Grave’
is for you. '

No, the founder of one of the most

David Byrne is the former front

incorporates many string arrange- ‘

this, he also addsa distinctive Eastern

all ends up sounding like a very scary

If you"are a fan of the Talking

definitely recommend giving this

Sweet deliveries of thecomrnonplace gives Flutterby wings

Butterfly Boucher

Recommended if you like:
Sarah McLachlan

From her British—looking, slightly
punk picture on the cover of her album,
F lutterby, Butterﬂy Boucher appears to
be out to kick your ass. But in reality,

Boucher is from Australia, soundslike _
she’s from Ireland, has far from event

the slightest touch of Sleater—Kinney,
and most likely does not want to kick
your ass. Well, that last part is just an
assumption. -

In her song “Never Let It Go,”
Boucher addresses perhaps the sharpest
criticism thrown her way by first
singing “Oh, another song about love
gone right” and then by answering
“ooh, but my stories are so sweet!”

_the perfect
freak’s work, Boucher

She’s right. Her
songs are about the fair-
ly commonplace themes
of love and relation-
ships, but her deliveries
of them are so delicious
that it hardly seems to
matter that the subject
has been addressed
before.

In what might be

Flutterby with that ‘in

considering the amount ‘

to complete them.
Sewn together are a

including guitars, drums, bass, piano,
organ and banjo, a set of lyrics that is
thoughtfulat worst and whimsical at
best, and a voice that’s as charming as
it is delicate.

Boucher stretches the idea of the
one-woman singer—songwriter band
wellbeyond the traditional Dylan into
an arrangement of sounds that most
multi-person groups couldn’t compete
with.

Flutterby has all the fun and exu-
berance of a debut album without sac-
riﬁcing any amountof later-work pol-
ish' that sometimes wrecks first
attempts.

Boucher’s “I’m a chick that can
either break your heart or rock, your

completely professional that you’d»

\ I After dropping  of ﬁve games to
open the season, Pitt looked to rebound in
the Hyatt Regency Cougar Classic hosted by

‘ _tl1e University of Houston.

The games didn’t ‘turn out how they
hoped, as they managed to win only one out

of ﬁve games.

Pitt 3, Mississippi State 2

Pitt freshman Laura Belardinelli eamed A

her ﬁrst career win in" a complete gaine-

’ pitching performance over ﬂie Bulldogs.

With the game tied in the bottom of the
seventh, Pitt’s Morgan Howard started off
with a single to get things going. Sheena
Hellon then doubled’ to drive in Howard for
the garne-winning run. : ‘

Houston 5, Pitt 0 ,

Pitt fell to Houston 5-0 in extra innings.
The game remained scoreless until the ninth,
when the Cougars notched ﬁve runs  their
half of the inning. v

Pitt’s Belardinelli struck out seven bat-

ters in her second complete game of: the day
and ﬁrst baseman Casey Pickard chipped in
defensively with 10 putouts.

BYU10,Pitt2 ,
Pitt fell hard to Brigham Young by los-
ing, 10-2. The Panthers found themselves in

' a hole early and were unable to mount any

sort of comeback ,

BYU took an early three-rim lead in the
ﬁrst, while Pitt attempted to come back by
scoring one of their own. Pitt’s Francesca
DiMaria walked and then stole second, and
Pickard drove her home from second with a
single to left ﬁeld
a BYU would go on to score seven more
runs, while Pitt failed to mount a big enough
rally to win the game.

Virginia 5, Pitt 3

Pitt took an early 1-0 lead in the ﬁrst
inning, taking advantage of the two errors
committed by 'V1rginia’s _inﬁeld. Pitt’s one-
rim lead would hold up until the third inning,
when Virginia managed to tie the game.

\V1th the bases loaded again in the sixth
inning, Pitt’s Jen O’Donnell doubled in a run

to give the Panthers’ the 2-1 lead. However,

the Cavaliers answered back with a four-run
sixth inning. — ‘ « A

‘ of the -seventh to narrow the lead and had the

opportunity to win the game later with bases

loaded and two outs, but couldn’t capitalize

as the last batter struck out to end the inning.

Villanova 8,’Pitt 0 .

In its ﬁnal’ game of the weekend, Pitt
was shut out 8-0 by ﬂie Wildcats in ﬁve
innings. The Panthers lost their fourth
straight game, dropping their record to 3-7
on the season. V

Pitt had only three hits in the ﬁve
innings, including a double by Hellon and’
singles from Howard and O’Donnell.

.Meghan Bostick started for the Panthers
and pitched two innings, allowing four hits
and‘ four runs, and was fellowed by
Belardinelli who pitched just ‘one inning,

That might not seem too relevant to the
world of Pitt sports, but remember the guy

matchup with Oregon State tonight—— that’s
three more losses than Howland’s team had

Before the season began, things started
horribly for Howland. In June, his father,
Bob, passed away after spending nearly a
month in a coma after falling oﬁ a ladder

On the court, Howland found that the

his ‘current players have on defense —
something uncharacteristic for a team

likely that only freshman Trevor Aiiza will

Krinsky led all scorers against Kent
State with four goals and two assists and
O’Connell had three goals and one assist.

Molly Suda had two goals and three
assists for the Panthers, while Tracey Eisen
had a goal and two assists.

In the second game of the doublehead-

Slippery Rock never led and never even
came close. ' '

The Panthers cruised to the victory
behind three goals from - O’Connell,
Krinsky, and Jamie Knotts each.

Pitt’s equestrian club olfers affordable‘

riding to students and is open to riders of all
skill levels. S v ' '
“[Our] club unites ‘students from across
the university community who share a com-
mon love .of horses,” said team member
Emma Taylor. ‘ '
I The team also has a variety of events,
such as barn clean ups and other fundraisers
that will take place over the course of the

semester. ,
Within the club, there is a show team,
which is made up of riders who compete for

.the school in the Intercollegiate Horse Show

Association. ’

The team is currently ranked No. 2 in
the region, and has several riders who have
already qualiﬁed for regional competition in

This past weekend, the team competed
at Wilson College. Riders were judgedon
both position and effectiveness. The team
scores points for each ribbon. won by indi-
vidual riders and_the team wiﬂr the most
points wins the show.

. Not only was Pitt the high-point team, it
also had the reserve high—point rider for the

day in Kira Mamula, who ﬁnished second in ’ _

total points. Marnula was one of two*Pitt rid-

. ers to ﬁnish ﬁrst. She placed‘ ﬁrst in novice
fences, while .Margaret Mahoney earned a *

ﬁrst place recognition in advanced walk,
trot, Canter. 1 .

Pitt’s next show is at Allegheny College
on March 7.

which ﬁnished 13-19. “I’m proud of how
Pitt is doing . . . I’m not surpris .”
‘Howland’s lack of astonishment at Pitt’s
success this year is because he knew what
kind of coach the team was getting when
Jamie Dixon was named as his successor.
Dixon spent eight years as How1and’s
assistant at Northern Arizona and Pitt and,
had Pitt not hired Dixon, Howland would

1 have tried to convince him to come to

UCLA.’
“Selﬁshly, it would have been the best

thing for me, but he’s more than paid his,

dues,” Howland said. ‘Tm excited they’re
being coached by Jamie. They wouldn’t
have that continuity if it weren’t for his hir-
ing.” _

When naming Dixon’s players and why
he’s so proud of them, it’s clear that
Howland would have liked anoﬂrer opport11—
nity to step on the court with them. And not
being able to coach players that he helped
recruit — like Chris Taft— has been tough.

“I’m missing out on [coaching] a great
group of kids,” he said, “but like I said
before, this is the only job I would have left
Pitt for.” _

And for the third time in his coaching
career, Howland faces the daunting task of
rebuilding a program that-has fallen on hard
times. Except rebuilding at UCLA will be a

‘ Rebuilding will be a toughproject

lot different than it was at Northem Arizona

' . or'Pitt. - -

UCLA is to college basketball like
Notre Dame is to college football — leg-
endary. No other school can come close to
the success that the Bruins had under coach
John Wooden. But that’s part of what

Howland is counting on when it comes time V

to recruit - ,

‘”Ihat’s the reason why the program is
so easy to sell; it’s second to none,” he said.
“Every year the program is going to get bet-
ten”

No matter how much he improves the

program, there is no way to accomplish what ,
.Wooden was able to do. Howland even

admits so himself, but then what will he need
to do to be considered a success?

Jim Harrick won a national title in 1995,
but was pushed out the door. His replace-
ment, Lavin, led his team to at least the
Sweet 16 in ﬁve of the six years he was head
coach and was still ﬁred.

Howland led Pitt that far in the last two
NCAA Tournaments and was considered a
miracle worker for it. If he makes it only that
far at UCLA, he’ll be just another coach.

But when looking for someone to tum
around such a storied program, there aren’t
many better choices than Howland. "
