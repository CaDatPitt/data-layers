Student Union
Board Creates
Two Positions

New positions have been*cre-
ated on the Student Union Board.

Forest Cross, pharmacy sopho-
more, will accept the position of
director of the newly-formed Pub-
lic Relations Board.

Public Relations, which was
formerly under the office of the
president, is now a separate de-
partment. Future plans for _this
department include a monthly
calendar which will list a rundown
on events, the background of pro-
grams and their purposes, and
speakers one can expect at these
programs.

Vicki Buchsbaum, sophomore
zoology major, will be the ﬁrst
director of the Music Room and
Art Exhibit, The reason for the
creation of the new position is
that the Music Room has been
expanded to full operation. f

The Music Roomlwill now be
open during the days, evenings,
Saturdays, and possibly Sundays.

Also the board now has F.M.
receiver equipment which it is in-
stalling in the SU Lounge. The
equipment will be student oper-
‘ated but at present the board has

_ no one to operate it.

A university needs, in addition
to teachers and investigators, a
group of men whom we may call
scholars.” That is, men of experi-
ence and wisdom who bring to
their work a wide vision and pro-
found understanding of the funda-
mental principles of their disci-
pline and its relation to other dis-
ciplines.

These men must provide a
synthesis of the multiform ma-
terials of specialized research
and interpret the meaning of in-
tellectual progress, both to the
academic community and to the
public at large.

Presents Darwin,"
Neo-Darwinistic.
Theory Studies

By JULES ZACHER

People rather than animals
are the point of concentration
for the neo-Darwinistic theo-
ries of evolution, according to
Dr. Ernest N a g e 1, , John
Dewey, Professor of Philoso-
phy at Columbia University.

Dr. Nagcl presented this point

in his lecture last week on the
“Structure of Evolutionary Ex-

planations.”
Neo—Darwin1stic theories of
evolution, Dr. Nagel explained,

are Darwin’s theories on evolution
brought up to date by including
genetics and sociological study of
populations.
ltelates Genetics

The, professor continued by re-
lating the role of genetics in this
scientiﬁc study. According to Dr.
Nagel, certain predictions about

the offspring of people can be,

made by statisti.cal study.

The naturalistic philosopher
said that these statistics are
available through segregating
the genes in the chromosomes
and then compiling statistical L
evidence .based on the gametes
growing from these separations.

The sociological part of the
theory is the study on large num-
bers of people. The genticist in-
terprets thetinformation turned in
by the sociologist by explaining
how mutations, or changes, arise
in the human.

These mutations, Dr. Nagel
said, arise from a change in en-
vironment due to migration. Also,
:x-rays and ultraviolet rays can
cause mutation.

Turns to Reason

Turning his attention to reason-
ing in science, Dr. Nagel dispelled
.the common belief that most of
the scientiﬁc explanations that we
have today are based on deduc-
tive reasoning. ‘

O

 Dr. Nagel Speaks About Evolution

DR. ERNEST NAGEL expounds

on evolution in his talk in the

Philosophy of Science lecture series. Nagel gave various points on
the Neo-Darwinistic theories of evolution and discussed the socio-

philosophical aspects of evolution.

Deductive reasoning uses gen-
eral propositions to arrive at a
specific calculation.

. “Despite the emphasis on sci-
ence being a way of achieving
reliable predictions,” the phil-
osopher continued, “not all of
these predictions are based on
deductive reasoning.”

‘§Non - deductive assumptions
are just as valid as deductive ones
if these predictions are proven
correct.”

Gives Evidence

After discussing the validity of
non—deductive reasoning, Dr. Na-
gel turned to Darwin’s Theory of
Evolution. He dwelled on Dar-
win's old theories to show how

they are different ‘from the con-
temporary theories.

 Entertainer to Appear

-“We can think of no better medium of cultural exchange
than Mrs; Jacobson’s English wit and humor,” commented

.William E. Eldridge, acting chair-O

man of the OCEE.

“Her versability, experience and
eloquence will provide us with
the most scintillating program
of the season.” _

Tea and crumpets will be serv-
ed in the Commons Room after
the meeting. It is open to every-
one. I

The Irish Room ‘Committee un-
der the OCEE will hold a recep-
tion in honor of Miss Joyce Haney,
1960 Student Awardee of the Irish

Spring Trimester

Work List Open

Students desiring full time em-
ployment during the spring tri-
mester, 1961, should notify the
Student Employment Office im-
mediately. This includes those stu-
dents who have previously regis-
tered with the Employment Oﬁice.

Students who registered with
the Student Employment Office
during the Fall trimester, 1960,
and have not as yet obtained part-
time employment, should notify
Student Employment of
schedule changes for the Winter
trimester.

Dr. Leitch Speaks
In Heinz Chapel

Dr. Addison H. Leitch, visiting
University Chaplain, will speak
on “Christian Growth: Justified”
tomorrow at noon in the Heinz
Chapel, of
Worship.

Chuck Reinhold will be the stu-
dent leader and the Heinz Chapel

University Service

Choir will sing an anthem.

According to the professor,
Darwin marshalled historical and
biological evidence to show that
man descended. fr > the apes.

Another important contribu-
tion was natural selection, a
process that permitted the sur-
vival of the ﬁttest. Natural se-
lection, said Dr. Nagel, was the
manner in which the best indi-

vidual animal of a species. sur- .

vived because the different or-
ganisms in this animal were the
most well adapted to the en-
vironment.

To sum up his lecture, Dr. Na-

gel said that evolutionary expla- ,

nations are not deductive, and
that predictions, rather than laws,
can be achieved from these propo-
sitions.

"A GUIDE FOR THE DATELESS”

With the cost of dating rising higlier and higher it is no Wonder
that so many of us men are turning to discus throwing. l\'atur-

are, the average man today lias :1 simple choice: dating or en ting.
Unless the average man happens to be Finst-er Sigafoos.

average man: he wanted to ﬁnd the prettiest coed on campus
and make her his. lle looked long and carefully, and at last he

He asked her for a date. She

of modestly priced ﬂowers.

“Now then,” said Kretchma, tossing the sleazy ﬂora to 9.

Finstcr was a man short on cash, but long on ideas. He had
prepared an attractive plan for this evening. “How would you
like to go out to the Ag campus and see the milking nm.chine?’5

he asked.
“Ick,” she replied.

“VVcll, what -uwcmld you like to <lc‘.”’ he asked.
“Come "’ said she. “to a funn 7 lit;-tic lace I know 'ust outside

The place vvns .\li|liouaires Roost, a simple country inn made
of solid ivory. It was ﬁlled with beautiful ladies in backless
gowns, handsome men in dickeys. Original Rcmbrandts adorned
the walls. Marlboro trays adorned the cigarette girls. Chained
to each table was a gypsy violinist.

l“inst-er and Kretchma were seated. “I,” said Kretchma to
the waiter, “will start with shrimps remoulade. Then I will have
lobster and capon in nuideria sauce with asparagus spears. For‘
dessert I will have melon stuffed with money}? ’

“And you, Sir?” said the waiter to Finster.

“Just bring me a pack of Marlboros,” replied Finster, “for
if ever a man needed to settle back and enjoy the mild. benefi-
cence of choice tobacco and easy-drawing ﬁltration, it is the
shattered hulk you see before you now.”

So, smoking the best of all possible cigarettes, Finstcr watched
Kretchma ingest her meal and calculated that every time her
fetching young AdaIn’s apple rose and fell, he was out another

97¢. Then he took her home.

It was w.l1.ile saying goodnight that Finster got his brilliant
idea. “listen!” he cried excitedly. “I just had a wonderful
notion. Next time we go out, let's go Dutch treat!”

By way of reply, Kretchma slashed him across the face with
her housemotlier and stormed into the house.

“Well, the heck with her,” said Finster to himself. “She is
just a gold digger and I am well rid of her. I am sure there are
many girls just as beautiful as Kretchma who will understand
the justice of my position. For after all, girls get as much
money from home. as men, so what could‘ be more fair than

sharing expenses on a date?”

With good heart and high hopes, Finster began a search for
a girl who would appreciate the equity of Dutch treat, and you
will be pleased to hear that he soon found one—-Mary Alice
Hematoma, a lovely three-legged girl with sideburns.

Religious Emphasis Week is being conducted on this
campus for the ﬁrst time in'four years. ‘During the next few
days students will attend lectures, ﬁreside chats and serv-
ices; at these meetings representatives of the Roman Catho-
lic,‘ Eastern Orthodox, Jewish and Protestant faiths will
speak about the role religion plays in their lives. ‘

No one can force students to attend or participate in
these activities, but we can suggest whyiwe think it would
be worthwhile:

The lectures being conducted are not designed to lure
students into actively participating, but rather to inform
students about the ideals of that particular religion.

The fireside chats‘ can serve"two purposes. Students
will be able to discuss with others their own personal feel-
ings, current beliefs and doubts. In addition, they will gain
insight into the role religion is playing in our society.

~ The services that will be conducted throughout this
week are mainly designed to‘ give students the opportunity
to actively participate if they desire, or merely to observe.

’ ' The Student Council on Religious Organizations, has
secured many fine. leaders from the different faiths to help

in making Religion Emphasis Week successful. As in past.

years,,we are sure students will take advantage of the op-

portunity to familiarize themselves with the ideals and cul-

tural inﬂuence of these religions.

Cleanliness is a virtue, but the degree to which the
Hunt Room employees are practicing it is beginning to at-

If one stops there for a coke in the afternoon, he must
ﬁrst make sure there is a place to sit since most of the
chairs are stacked on the tables. 1

Then one must tread across the soapy ﬂoor in order, to

We therefore, challenge whether cleanliness is next to
godliness. It is hard for us to believe that the ﬂoor of the

The Voice of the Proiphetq. .W

Pitt - 1984

By Jim O'_Brien ‘

The freshman ‘English class at Ptit in 1984 would
shock the students who were in my class when I
ﬂunked twenty—four years ago. In a towering ca-
thedral in a suburb of Oceania,‘ on a plot of ground
once occupied by Churchill Downs, the most recent
extension of the University stood
in’ 1984. "

One day I passed thropgh the "f
Proletarians Room and headed 3.
for the Russian Nationality Room 
at thirty-seven o'clock. As I en '
tered room 101, I noticed that all 
the proles were -studying their g
Victory Newspeak t e x  books
Everyone was wearing his‘_blue
shorts, gray shirt, and red neck
erchief; which distinguished his
membership in the ROTC Spies.

Carved in the wooden panels at the front of the
class was the slogan of the department: WAR IS
PEACE—FREEDOM IS SLAVERY—IGNORANCE
IS STRENGTH. No instructor was present yet, for
the “honor system” had recently been adopted,
since the telescreens had been installed. *

The tele/screen received and transmitted simul-
taneously, anyvsound above the level of a very low
whisper. If you were foolish enough to double
think——a system of mental ‘cheating——you could be
punished by death, or taken to a forced-labor camp.

More of Nothing _

On the wallslof the room were scarlet banners
of the Youth League and the Spies, a full size poster
of Big Brother L. Big Brother L. kept telling us
through the telescreén that because of his Three-
Year, Plan we had more intelligence, more recrea-
tion, more educa_tion———more of everything except
tuition and gym ental fees. .

Suddenly we heard a roar and the ground shook.
We saw a black cloud of smoke rise in the dis-
tance. *A rocket bomb had just exploded on Fort
Knox. They had refused to allow Big Brother L. to
buy it in accordance with his_plan to store the Uni-

 

 

‘Versity’s assets there.

Finally, Comrade Cavonovsky appeared in the
doorway.‘ Cavonovsky, a member of the Inner
Party, was about ﬁfty years of age. He was wear-
ing an aged jacket of black velvet which gave him
a vague air of intellectuality.

His tightly-knit red coiffure made one distrust
him and the rubber truncheon which he balanced
meditatively between his thumb and foreﬁnger
added to the effect. He peered over the top of his
spectacles which dahgled on his pug nose, and sur;
veyed the class with his‘*tiny, suspicious eyes.
pouchy cheeks broke into a weird grin. He said
that we were going to write a theme during the
Five-Minute Hate Period.

Reject Reality

We were instructed to reject the evidence of our
eyes and ears.
rs——entertaining the same thoughts and employing
the same topic sentence. Anything original would
be considered counter-revolutionary. ,

My theme had to be rewritten and rewritten un-.

striving for unreality.

“O’Brien!,”i screamed the telescreen. “6079
O’Brien J! Yes, you! Don’t get carried away with
your imagination. That is ridiculous, but true.
Don’t go too far——make it publishable.” r ‘

Shortly after,’ ‘Cavonovsky read some of the
paragraphs aloud. They were all rehashings of the
ancient,themes——slum tenements, starving children,
street battles, capitalists in top hats.

“Here is a beautiful sense detail,” he shrieked. ,

A brown rat, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers
with long whiskers and yellow teeth, dove like 5
bulletat the face of the infant in a crib, and bored
:1 hole straight through his cheeks and devoured his
tongue.” , '

The class howled in approval as Cavonovsky
chuckled over the excellence of the work. When
the class ended, I walked-‘down the hall smiling.
My theme had a “V” on it.

Turner Speaks Out

On Colodny Issue

Editoi‘, The Pitt News:

In ‘view ‘of the profusion of
opinions being attributed to me
concerning the so-called Colodny
case, I feel obliged to make pub-
lic my views on that question.
They are as follows:

1.) I do not advocate dismissal
of Dr. Robert Colodny on the
basislof evidence which has been
made public at this time. Any
qualiﬁed statements concerning
such dismissal are premature,
pending reports of the investi-
gating committees.

2.) Whatever Dr. Colodny did

I not do, it is clear that he did

become involved in politics by
signing the Fair Play for Cuba
advertisement and is therefore
obliged to accept criticism of his
political views. “Academic free-
dom” does not render a profes-
sor exempt from publib criticism
of his pro—Castro views or of
his associations with groups cited
as subversive. The cry of “aca-
demic freedom” cannot be rais-
.ed to protect from criticism pro-
fessors who willingly involve
themselves in political disputes.
3.) Regardless of any other
questions, it seems clear that Dr.
Colodny i has been a political

dupe. Only a dupe or a sub-_

versive could so consistently
serve the interests of the inter-
national Communist conspiracy.
A person capable of sound rea-
soning would not join a pro-
Castro group whose activities
were principally ﬁnanced‘ by the
Castro government. Instead a
sound thinking person would
have refused to serve as an un-
registered agent of a Moscow-
oriented foreign power, just as
he would have refused to coop-
erate with subversive groups at
the very time our men were be-
ing slain on the frozen hills of
Korea.

4.) The Legislature of Penn-
sylvania has not only the right
to investigate the University, {but
the obligation to do so, for if the
University is to receive funds
from the state it must be pre-
pared to accept state scrutiny or
to cease receiving state aid. The
Assembly would be negligent if
it allocated funds without know-
ledge of their use.

5.) The American Association
of University Professors says it
will “defend any professor,’ re-
gardless of his associations.” This
is typical of the childish ex-
tremism of that group" which
fails to recognize that there are
times when charges against a
a professor may (1)_ be true and
(2) be sufficiently serious to re-
quire his dismissal. It is idiopy
to maintain that a professor
shouldbe defended against at-
tack until one discovers what he
is being attacked for.

6-)‘ It is, in short, my judg-
ment that a professor, not unlike

, all citizens, ought to express his

opinions on public affairs, but he

is also obliged to accept ex—“

posure and criticism when he es-
pouses nonsense which ' many
judge help to endanger the sec-
urity of the United States. Until

‘he is certiﬁed as incompetent or

subversive, let him remain, but
let those who study under him
know of his political aberra-
tions.

Student Disagrees
With Liberal Views

Editor, The Pitt News:

Before I state an opinion I
would like to make clear that it
has no direct reference to Dr.
Colodny. I personally feel that
he is completely innocent until
proven otherwise.

The point of my letter is this..

 

permitted to

I’ ﬁnd it extremely difficult to
agree with stud<‘$nts’that hold the
View that a communist should be
instruct "in our
American universities. Why per-

mit a communist to influence’

young, susceptible minds, when
his sole objective is the subver-

’sion of American democratic in-

stitutions. Almost e v e r y o n e
knows that the sole communist
objective-is the overthrow of our
government and world domina-

tion. If only one person is ‘lead '

into the communist philosophy
we have lost part of the battle
against communism. ‘

Would a student allow a per-

son whose purpose was to harm
the student’s family to live in
his house? I hardly think so.
Then why allow a communist to
teach, whose purpose is the over-
throw of democratic government
and one’s own country. Many
students are mixing up ideals

with pure logic. It is not any ,_
-more un-democratic to forbid"
“communists to teach in Amer-

ican universities than it is to
put a man in jail for committing
a crime. .

Trials, Tribulations of A Music
Room, or Signs of Progress

By TOM BRYANT

‘Patrons to the old Schenley Hotel barber shop will be

surprised to ﬁnd that the barber chairs have been replaced
by a mechanical invention called “high ﬁdelity”.
...;They will also ﬁnd women trespassing into an area once
held sacred as a refuge for males from their nagging wives.
Today, the cubicle adjacent to the Hunt Room in the

Student Union houses the Music:

Room. Industrious students have
removed the barber pole and fix-
tures and redecorated the area
with fresh paint and wallpaper.

The Student Union Board pro-'
vided furniture and sound equip-
ment. Thus -the facilities .were
ready for business, except for one
minor problem: the phonograph
didn’t work. After weeks of futile
searching for replacement parts,
the Board ﬁnally replaced the en-
tire system.

Problem Arises

Once again, a problem arose:
moisture had warped the Music
Room door and a new lock had
broken, tightly jamming the door
shut. Again days (and ‘probably
sworn oaths) passed as officials
worked through “channels” to
have the door repaired. .

Today, the facilities are ready
foruse as soon as enough students
volunteer to act as disc jockeys.

A special fund has made over
$1000 worth of records available
to the Music Room and addi-
tional albums are purchased as
often as possible.

The collection emphasizes clas-
sical music, with a smattering of
show, popular, jazz, folk, and in-
ternational L.P.’s.

Operators Needed

The newest albums include
/‘spoken word selections. These
*-are recordings of such literary
masterpieces as “Don Juan In
Hell” and the works of Mark
Twain, spoken by outstanding lit-
erary and entertainment artists.

The Student "Union Board ur-
gently needs students to act as
Music Room operators for two or
more hours weekly. Applications
may be obtained at the main desk
in the S.U. The board will then

clerical work.

In past years it has been the
function of the Student Union to
plan and hold Pep Rallies, but this
year the responsibility fell to Stu-
dent Government. Student Gov-
ernment, in turn--asked the as-
sistance of the cheerleaders.

Presently, it is hoped that the
larger organization of the Block
P committee will take charge of”
this function with the head
cheerleaders serving on its com-
mittee and acting as a coordi-
nator of the committee.

Changes are also being made in
the method of selecting future
cheerleaders. Formerly it was the
practice to invite judges to come
from Duquesne, Carnegie? Tech
and other local universities to
judge.

Presently, it is planned for the
role to be shifted to members of
University community. A
proposed future panel of judges
would consist of the head cheer-
leader, a member of the physical
education department, a member
of the "Pitt Newslstaff, and repre-
sentatives of the various varsity
teams. 0‘

It is hoped that, this new pro-
cedure will lead to a more effi-

7 Cats Own Even Slate

Bucknell lTomor1'ow*—

 

 

Following Miami Loss

By JIM O’BRIEN

Bucknell will oppose the Panther basketball team to-
morrow night, and the contest will pose an opportunity for
the Cats to break out of their .500 ledger once again. How-
ever, the scales may tip in the wrong direction, for the Lewis-
burg, Pa. team had won seven straight games, before being
setback 101-79 by strong Virginia Tech last Saturday night.

Bob Timmons’ players put a re—¢

spectable 8-8 record on the line,
after winning and losing to Villa-
nova and Miami (Ohio) respec-
tively this past week. The Pan-
thers fell 62-48 on Saturday, as
Miami's six-foot center, Ralph
Wright blocked shots and re-
bounded consistently to frustrate
the losers.

Dave Zeller paced the Indians
with 15 points, all tallied in the
ﬁrst half, when the hosts held a
35-24 advantage at .the intermis-
sion. Timmons’ ﬁve starters con-
verted 19% of their goal attempts,
and only Tom Maloney, Ben Jink
and Howard Lockhart scored three
-times from the floor. p

Cats Upset Oddmakers ‘

The previous Wednesday the
Cats upset the odds-makers and
Villanova likewise, 57-55. Work-
ing from a slowed-down attack,
featuring careful maneuvering of
the ball, until an opening de-
veloped, the winners overcame the
Wilcats. ‘

An indication of how well they
worked for shots is shown by
the fact that Maloney made the
only basket from outside the
keyhole.

Bucknell pulled away from the
University of Virginia on Friday
night -for a 99-81 victory on the
Cavaliers’ home court. Bruce Ba-
bich paced the Mid—Atlantic rep-
resentative with 31 points, and he
should be the No. 1 target for the
Cats’ defense.

shooting carried the visitors to a

Meet Ohio U., Seek
Season’s Third Win

' Today the Panther Mermen
travel to Ohio University with
hopes of continuing their
surge of power as shown
_against Bucknell.

In copping their second vic-

‘ tory of the season, the tankers

broke three records and tied an-
other in their 57-38 win over the

Bisons from Bucknell.

In the ﬁrst event of the atfer-
noon, Jerry Sollinger, Carl War-
nes, Tony Sarsﬁeld, and Dick
Rush teamed up to set a new re-
cord in the 400 yard medley re-
lay. Their 3:59.9 time knocked 3.1
seconds off the record they set, at
Lehigh.

In the 200 yard individual
3medley, Jack Hayes covered the
distance in 2:19.’! to break the
record set by Tony Tresser in
1956. ‘ -

Tony Sarsﬁeld broke his own
record in the 200 yard butterfly.
Sarsﬁeld had previously set the
record at 2:22 but against the
Bisons, he cut his time down to
2:17.7.

Bart Haas, rated "by Coach
Grady as the most improved
swimmer on the team, tied Jim
Emert’s record for the 50 yard
freestyle. Haas turned in a 23.3
time to tie Emert’s record.

The Mermen now post a sea-
son record of 2-2 but Coach Grady
feels optimistic as he looks at the
remainder of the schedule. “This
team is one of the fastest teams
we have had at the University,
but we have met some stiff compe-
tition,” commented Coach Grady.

Cubs Score 1 14

Sheffield Leads

To 8th Win

By BARRY EPSTEIN

Coach Carl Peterson’s ex-
pectations proved unfounded
as the freshmen basketball
team defeated Indiana State
Teachers College, 114-89 on-
the losers court. All ﬁve start-
ers broke into double ﬁgures.

Cal Sheffield led all scorers with
26 points. Dave Sauer had 23,
Brian Generalovich had 20 and
Paul _Martha and Paul Krieger
added 17 and 16 respectively.

Peterson had predicted a "tough
battle because of possible new
additions down from the varsity
and because of the small size of
the Indiana State court.

The once beaten Cubs did not
heed these warnings as they
widened their 19 point half time
gap to a winning margin of 25.
This was the eighth straight win
for the freshmen. They have re-
mained undefeated since they
sustained their only loss to Slip-
pery Rock in their opening en-
counter.

Previous to the Indiana State
win, the Cubs defeated a tough
Youngstown club, 83-74. Fast
breaking the Cubs to a 40-36 ﬁrst
half lead were Sheffield and Gen-
eralovich. On one charge down
court, Sheffield fed Generalovich
with a pass off the backboard.

Earl McConnell Dominates Tumbling Event
With 276 Points, Lehner Captures Rings

By LARRY HAGGERTY

Friday afternoon the Panther
gymnastics team will ﬂy south to
Atlanta, Georgia, where they will
encounter Georgia Tech on Satur-

‘day afternoon in an effort to gain

their ﬁrst triumph of the 1961 gym
campaign. '

The Jungle Cats were trounced «

by Navy 66-30 in their inaugural
meet of the season, and last Satur-
day" afternoon they succumbed to
the defending Eastern team cham-
pions, Army, by a 521/fa-431/2 mar-
gin at the Field House.

As usual, Panther Earl McCon-
nell dominated the meet with an-
other outstanding tumbling dis-
play that earned him a total of 276
points and an easy victory over his
competitors.

Cats also won the ﬂying rings with

«Jack Lehner and Joe Battaglia

coming in ﬁrst and second respec-
tively with scores of 246 and 236.
Army, however,’ took the side
horse, high bar, rope climb and
parallel bars.

McConnell executed another
back double somersault with
near-perfect form as he and Co-
captain Battaglia got the Blue
and Gold off to a 10-6 lead in

the tumbling event, but the Ca-

that. ‘

Ron Daugherty, a Panther sen-
ior, hit one of the best routines of
his career and ﬁnished second on
the horse with 215.

Panther Hopes End

The Panther "hopes of an upset
victory came to an abrupt end in
the high bar after Army’s Merle“
Williams and Steve Best took ﬁrst
and second with scores of 253 and
246 respectively.

Daugherty lowered his time

all this gained the Panther gym-
nast was a third behind the Ca-
det’s Dave Hastings and Dick
Yule who recorded 3.6 and 3.8
times.

The visitors’ Larry Richards and
Ed Hendren eked out a narrow
win on the parallel bars over the
Panthers’ Zamecnik and Bob Pin-
gatore with 230 and 229 scores to
226 and 225.

Lehner and Battaglia closed out
the afternoon with their victory
on the ﬂying rings. The two Jun-
gle Cats had the added advantage
of not having to contend with
Army’s Jon Arronson, the EIGL
rings’ champ, for the past two
years. who was out of action due
to a broken wrist.

Undefeated

By TED COLTON

Coach Rex Peery’s matmen went down to their second
defeat of the year Saturday as a strong Army team garnered a

19-12 victory. The Cat frosh alsowent down to defeat, losing
, their ﬁrst of the year, 19-13. '

The 147 pound bout‘was

the deciding factor, although

the Panthers still had their opportunities to win. Peery com-

mented, “Last week against North-G

western we won_ all the close
matches but against Army all the
close ones went their way.”
John Zolikoff lost his ﬁrst dual
meet bout to Army’s Mike Natviz.
The Cadet pinned Zolikoﬂ’ with
five seconds to go.
Cats Needed Pin

The Panthers needed "a pin in
the ﬁnal match to win but heavy-
weight Bob Guzik missed his
chance for a fall‘ and ended up
losing 7-4. s

“Guzik had a chance to pin
_his man but missed it,” com-
,mented Peery. “He still had a
chance to win but turned the
. wrong way and got taken down.-
It sure was a great match and
Guzik gave everything he had.”
Peery concluded.

Peery also lauded Dave Osmun
and August Arrigone, both losers.
“Osmun was in a draw with a
minute to go. Instead of being sat-
isﬁed with a tie he went for the
takedown and got caught.” Osmun
lost 6-3.

Beaten Badly

Although Arrigone was beaten
badly, Peery said, “He really gave
all he had out there and did a ﬁne
job-” Arrigone, was wrestling Al
Rushatz, one of the ﬁnest 167
pounders in the country.

Although the Panthers were
beaten, D i c is Martin, Larry
Lauchle, Daryl Kelvington and
Jim Harrison came through with
victories.

Relay Teams Win

By 303 HSMIZIK

The Panther track team
traveled to Army on Saturday
where they absorbed their
second loss of the indoor sea-
son in as many tries, 56 7-1/6
to 52 5/6. The Army Plebes
also showed themselves to be poor
hosts as they defeated the Panther
Frosh, 74-33.

The inability to place in the
mile and two mile runs cost the
Panther varsity the meet. Harry
Stokes, one of the Cat’s top run-
ners, placed a disappointing fourth
in the mile.

Despite the loss, Coach Carl
Rees was pleased; by the perform-
ance of some of his men. He was
particularly ‘ high on the running
of the mile and tam mils relay
teams. “Army’s great depth ena-
bled them to have fresh men in
the relays,”oRees said, “while-our
boys were running tired. Being
able to win two relays from Army
is a ﬁne accomplishment.”

highs during the meet. In win-

With eight games remaining on the schedule it still re-

If Pitt could keep up the pace they have set in the last

Panthers? t Arde Fan

Mac F ollows Cats

In Every Sport "
For Forty Years

By JIM O'BRIEN
Raymond McClain operates
an elevator in the Cathedral
of Learning, and most likely
he has heard from many orig-
inal jesters, that_his job has

its “ups anddowns.” Ironic- 

ally enough, “Mac’s” beloved Pan-
ther athletic teams traditionally
perform in the same roller coaster
fashion, yet he remains their most
loyal fan.

“Mac” has been a ﬁxture on the
campus sports circles‘ since the
early ’20’s, yet never has been of-
fered a coaching position or ele-
vated to faculty status. He just
loves sports, and his only reward.
is the friendship of the people who
participate in the contests.

The school’s tranquil answer to
Duquesne’s towncrier, “Mossie”
Murphy, resides at the Park Vue
Apartments, right in the middle of
the school real estate plan. From
this starting block,, he is con-
stantly racing about the grounds,
keeping tab on his boys, whether
they be playing football, basket-
ball, squash, golf, baseball or
cricket.

Watches Anything

"1 watch anything,” he stated
emphatically. “It doesn’t matter
what sport it is, I love it. It’s
healthy and I meet a lot of nice
people’?

“Mac” is frequently stationed
at the turnstiles at the basket-
ball "games, and once the’ crowd
is seated, he joins them to root
his Panthers to victory. When-
ever the game is over, he never’,
fails to go down into the dress-
ing room, to. coiigratulate the
hoopsters win or lose;

“Mac” and his wife are as essen-
tial as peanuts and a ﬂask at the
Stadium. When the Cats take to
the road, the sports ambassador
wishes the griddcrs good luck be-
fore the buses depart from the
Student Union. Then he scampers
home to focus his television to
watch the telecast.

McClain’s fervor for sports isn’t
restricted to this school alone. He

matmen, won his fifth of the year
with a 5-0 decsision over Phil
Burns. Lauchle took the 130 pound
class with a 8-0 victory over Gary
Slack. In the first two_bouts the
Panthers were ahead 6-0 in team
score and Army had not yet scored
a point in the individual matches.

But Osmun went for the win
instead of the draw and lost.

Zolikoff proceeded to get pinned
giving Army a 8-6 edge.

Kelvington easily defeated Bob
Vanneman, 10-3, to forge the
Panthers back into the lead, 9-8.
Rushatz downed Arrigone, and
Harrison won a close one 3-2 over
Warren Miller to make the score
12-11 with»two bouts to go.

Chuck Shaffer, Panther 191
pounder, was pinned by Ray
Nickla with 4:26 remaining and
Guzik lost to round out the match.

Youngstown showed the Cubs
an amazing display of outside

cation of poor defense, Peterson
commented, “Their outside shoot-

defense was at par. You just can’t
guard a guy way out in left ﬁeld
or he’ll drive on you.”
