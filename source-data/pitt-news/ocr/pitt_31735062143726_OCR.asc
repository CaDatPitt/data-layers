A "code for the modern “Complete
Angler" was outlined by Dr. Charles
H, heitell, .head'_ of the _department
of‘ accounting at the University and
niember of the“ board of Fish Com-
missionerso of the State ‘of Pennsyl-

vania, in a radio talk from the Uni-

versity studio of KDKA last week. _
‘D1"..Reitell emphasized the neces-
sity of the, conservation of ﬁsh‘ and
their "food and of painstaking care
to -‘make and keep rivers and lakes

available for abundant ﬁsh life. He

declared that modern anglers should
also ..strive - to rid ﬁsh life of the
menaces of the water ' snake and
the hawk. W - '

Other‘ sections}-in the-code includ-
ed vigilance «against the “ﬁsh hog”
who ruthlessly wastes_.and destroys

‘his’ catch, ﬁghting against ‘the pollu-

tion of waters, the study of'ﬁsh life.
and habits, the study of river vege-
tation and other ﬁsh food andthe de-
velopment .of .ar.ti-ﬁcial ﬁsh culture
in order to keep the‘ supply of‘ﬁ-sh
a.bre'asti the number of ﬁshermen. Dr.
Reitell declares that. more than
1,000,000 of Pennsylvania’s 6,000 000

-not oust of fear, but because he un-

essential for the preservation’ of ﬁsh-
ing sport. He --believes that the com-
plete 'angler_’_ is .the result of a
wholesome""development from boy-
‘hood’ and girlhood days and he is as

an exponent of ‘the ‘water sport, both
as a swimmer and as a coach. While

‘Careful precautionary methods are
