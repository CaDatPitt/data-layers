Dixon Deems Pre-Registration,

“Nine out of tenstudents will be better off under the '

Arts recently.

However, Dixon emphasized that the student who does
not pre-register will be at a decided disadvantage in the fall.

Chest Committee
Distrilautes Funds
At Njoon Luncheon

The Pitt Chest Committee will
hold a luncheon tomorrow at noon
in Dining Room A of the Student
Union to close the 1958-59 cam-
paign. Chairman Michael Altman
will present checks to representa-
tives of the four organizations to
which the collection was allocated.

The total amount collected by
this_year’s campaign, $1,150, was
divided among the World Univers-
ity Service -- $515, the United
Fund — $257.50, Care Book Fund
— $154.50 and National Scholar-
ship Service and Fund for Negro
students —- $103.

The Save the Child Federation
has already been sent $120 to
ﬁnance the adoption of Young Ho
Lee, an eight year old Korean
boy. Further details will be found

¢Since the number of sections of

a course offered will depend on
the number of students who pre-
register for it, those who have not
pre—registered may not be able to
obtain entry to a desired or need-
ed course. ’

Adjustments in schedule will, _

of course, be made in the fall
for those students with legiti-
mate reasons for ‘ a schedule
change. “Legitimate reasons”
would be, for example, ‘having
taken a course selected in the
spring in summer school, a legit-
imate desire to substitute an-
other course for one previously
selected‘, or a desire to make a
schedule change on the part of
a working student. ‘ ‘

Dixon " further stressed that
“schedules. will be made up for
students who have not pre-regist-
ered only after schedule adjust-
ments for pre—registered students
have been made.” 9 ,_ p

The procedure for juniors and
seniors in‘ Liberal Arts in pre-
registering is to choose a major,
if they have not already done so,
and make an, appointment with

also to students applying for re-
newal.

All scholarships other than Sen-‘

atorial must -be renewed annually,
regardless of the number of years

for which the award was authoriz-
ed.

Current freshmen who antici-
pate attendance in the third
trimester next year must indi-
cate their intentions at the time
they apply for ﬁnancial aid.

Available scholarship funds will
be awarded during the summer for
all three trimesters. Only loan as-
sistance will be available to stu-
dents who delay applications until
the fall.

Any student ﬁling the appropri-
ate application forms and qualify-
ing under the following criteria
will be considered for a scholar-
ship award. Entering sophomores
should have maintained a Q.P.A.
of at least 250 as a freshman.

Juniors and seniors should
have maintained a B-minus

Q.P.A. for their sophomores; 1.75

for current juniors. 'The appli-
cant should also possess those

personal qualities of character ‘

and citizenship which indicate

leadership potential. .

It _is expected that awards for
the 1959-60 academic year will
be announced by July 15. -

All Prize Winners ‘-

Students at Cantini

By DEBBIE WILLSON
“These students are ‘all out-

standing,” said Mr. Hovey,

chairman of the Fine Arts—De-

-partment as he‘ presented

prizes to the shx winners of

the 1959 Student Art Exhibit.

The students, all of whom did
their prize winning work in
courses taught by Virgil Cantini
include Herbert Margolis and
Dona Davis, who won recognition
for their paintings. Miss Davis is
a non-degree evening student.
‘Two students, Janet Bruder, ’59
and Jim Scott, who graduated in
February, won prizes for their
sculpture, Francis Kregelstein’s

ing, and a graduate student, Grace
won the prize for her

The judges of the exhibit were:
Jeanette" Jena, art critic‘ of ‘the
Post Gazette; and Mary Adaline
McKebbon, Director of Art for the
Pittsburgh public schools.

The prizes presented the stu-
dents were books pertaining to
some phase of art in which each
is interested.

Most of these students have
taken several courses from Mr.
Cantini and their work is varied.
Margolis, for- example, feels him-
self to be influenced in his work
chiefly by the Irnpressionistic
school of painting. Most of the

Jim Scott had his piece, repre-
sentative of a bird in flight, bronz-
ed and sanded it himself.

Cantini feels that the st dents
should not be taught stereo yped
forms, but allowed to develop
creativity, to obtain through guid-
ance, practice in creative work.
“Creativity . is essential not only
in art but in other ﬁelds as well,
in business and in professional or
scientiﬁc areas,” Cantini says.
“This is one of our objectives,” he
emphasized, “to help students de-
velop creativity they may use in
other ﬁelds.”

Insurance Instructor R. Field
Missing Since Last Tuesday.

The whereabouts of Ronald T.

Field, assistant ‘instructor in the
School of Business Administration,
are still unknown. He was last
seen at his home about 8 a.m.
Tuesday. '
I Atithat time it was believed
Field was on his way ‘to the Inter-
national Motors in .Mt. Lebanon,
but records show that he di_d not
have an appointment there and
never appeared.

Field’s car was found wrecked
at the bottom of a 25 foot em-
bankment b e t w e e n Dravosburg
and Clairton. Police dragged the
Monongahela River below the

wrecked car unsuccessfully. West
Miﬁ‘lin Police Chief Stephen Gar-

rick mentioned the possibility that

Field’s father may hire a diver to
search the concrete slabs at the
bottom of the river for his son’s

_ body.

Two facts learned about Field
seem to support two of Gar-
sick’s suppositions about his
disappearance. He had confided
in students that he was, not be-
ing rehired by V the University,

.- and one student revealed that

sperm mm ooaroamori. avmoenonai-oomwuqpn

he had several times been known
to fall asleep at the wheel.

Garsick had suggested either
that Field had committed suicide,
or that death was accidental.
Field may have been injured when
the car plunged over the embank-'
ment and stepped into the river in
a dazed state.

Gassick also suggested the pos-
sibilities that Field’s disappear-
ance was voluntary, or that he had

is no evidence so far in support of
this.

Korean ChildHo Lee Adopted

sity students through their Pitt Chest contribu-
tions. stands alone and with his family near their

0 * =9

Young Ho Lee is an eight-year
old Korean Boy whom University
students have adopted through
their contributions to the Pitt

Chest. He, his grandfather, moth— '

er, father and seven brothers and
sisters live in an area known as
Sung Sa Ri.

This is midway between the
city of Seoul and the southern
boundary of the demilitarized zone
separating Communist North
Korea from the Republic of South
Korea.

It is a community located on
one of the main avenues of ap-
proach used by the Communists
on June 25, 1950, and again in
their second drive in December,
1950. Thus it might be said that
the present village has grown
from the ashes of the Korean
War.

Young H0 is now in the sec-
ond grade of primary school
which he enjoys attending. He

# 12 *

was born in the early part of
the war, and he was carried on
the backs of the family members
as an infant. He is especially
interested in reading comic
books.

At the advent of the invasion of
the communists, the'family took
refuge in the south, leaving be—
hind everything beyond what they
could carry. Their house was com-
pletely burned down due to the
battle ﬁre. They had to sell some
of their farm land to keep the
family going.

Now the family is farming 1900
pyung of land (slightly over 1.5
acres) and has a minimum stand-
ard of living. They have "rebuilt a
small house with two rooms. Two
children are now in primary
school, and school fees are fairly

A high for this poor family.

The following is a translation of
a letter received from Young Ho
Lee’s older brother:

grade, having been born in the early pa
war. His community is located on one of the main
avenues of approach used by the Communists on
two drives and toward the city of Seoul.

:Wa_shingt_onj Semester Program I

_ By lno Amdur _
"Communication in a school as large as Pitt pre-
sents a problem. For this reason there are many
excellent opportunities at Pitt which only a very
small segment of the student population is aware
of. ‘One of these opportunities is entitled the “Wash-

ington Semester Program.”

Pitt is one of 70 universities
throughout the country‘ which
participates .in this program
conducted at the American Uni-
versity in Washington, D. C.’ Any
capable student ‘regardless of his
major subject is enabled by this
program to spend one semester
at American University -in order.
to study American government 
at the place where it"can best be observed.

The program- itself: is divided into four main

‘parts. First is a seminar on American government
in action. In this part of the program the students
meet with government.» oﬁicials, scholars, and other
qualiﬁed people who discuss problems -associated
with the five main parts__of the seminar.

The seminar includes discussions abopt Congress
and. its agencies; Parties,‘ Pressure ‘Groups, and

Public Opinion; the President and the Executive"
Branch; International Relations and Organization;’_e

and the‘ Administration of Justice. These topics
are discussed by some of the most qualiﬁed people
in their respective ﬁelds. ‘
Work On One Problem

The individual research project is the second
division of the ‘program. Each student chooses a

particular political problem and does ‘extensive re-‘

search on the subject. This is an excellent way to
become informed on one particular field of study
and provides invaluable experience on research

"also" carries a regular schedule of classes.

The
schedules are determinedlby the student, his ad-

Fifteen credits are taken as Pitt credits; they are
not transferred from American University. The

each quarter. ‘ g
The special event is the fourth division of the

No Béi-fer Program

Therefare few programs which could be more
advantageous to political science students than this
one. Living in the nation’s ‘capital, a student has
in his immediate environment’ both the people
and, the institutions which are the constitutents of
our government.

The nature of the’ program is planned so that
the student can derive the greatest possible‘ bene-
fit from his stay in Washington. The Seminars and
the special events give the student more informa-
tion about the practical workings of government
in one semester than he would gainein twice that
time by only attending classes.

For the non-political science major‘ interested
in government this program can also be of great
help. An intensive study of government whether
it is related to one’s major field or not gives the
student much insight into both national and inter-
national aﬁairs. V

   
   
  
   
  
  
   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
   
   
     
  
 
  
  
   
  
  
  
    
  
 
  
   
   
    
 
 
    
  

_« months of the year with abbreviated vacations to do nothing
« but the work assigned them. _ _

This would be little short of a tragedy educationwise.

The chance for development and maturation in college
comes as much from material learned outside the class-
room-« asiwithin. The upsurge in students’ use of the library
could go by the boards if individuals allow trimester life to
spoon-feed them a certain amount of course material in two
and two-third years.
2 Upperclassmen next year have an opportunitythat may
go ‘wasted. Many will not be in school from April until__.Sep-'
tember, 1960. This presents a manifold chance for self-educa-
tion, for reading volumes which are valuable but somehow
did not creep into our course curriculum.

The library and perh_aps the office of the vice chancel-
lor of academic discipline should prepare lists of books
which might be valuable, informative,.and enjoyable to stu-
dents not registered in school. The library should permit
these students to draw out books, if it can possibly be ar-
ranged, using the ID cards from the previous semester.

Other colleges have actual reading programs, wherein
"a certain portion of the academic year isedevoted strictly to
reading, (no classes), sometimes course material, other
times not. V - I _ *

When‘ the point was raised during discussion of the‘
feasibility of trimesters that students who attend on this
program would stand to lose the summer season reading
that they normally do, some scoffed saying that students at

" this University for the most ‘part do‘ not care for such things
and thus will suffer no loss. ' ' it

who attend three trimesters have a challenge to continue

_ the self—educative process, students who attend only two

- have anlopportunity to do more on their own than ever be-
fore possible. . ‘

When this University has enlightened students, willing

to think for themselves, to ferret out information other than

the instructor provides, to analyze weak and strong points

claim to be raising standards of academic excellence.

Advisory Program
Harmful to Students

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is usual to gripe about the
administration and its icy dream-
ers, about wild expansion‘ and
money grabbing —— complaints

.. that only time_ can support or
subdue. There‘ is however one
produpt of the ‘new order that

4 is directly harmful to the stu;-_
~ dents, and that is the advisory .

program. -
In this new set-up the student
chooses only his courses, and his
adviser selects the teachers and
times. This is the infancy of a
certain Vice Chancell_or’s system
forplanned education.

He has said that he disap—,

"proves of cafeteria-like education
in which the student goes down
the line and picks up what he
wants. This same man proposes
that soon the freshman will be-

‘ gin his four years with a general
course in his major ﬁeld, and
then goon to increasingly more
specific ones -—-, allowing most
students little choice of any kind.

The great crime will be, and
already is, that students cannot
chose their professors. Admini-
strators, marble halls, and shin-
ing laboratories have little -to do
‘with education compared with
the power of the teacher.

exciting if the—man in front of
the class has the ﬁre to light it.

inner vision and can infuse it in
the student, so that the subject,

‘ SGA Like Young
Men’s A'ssociation
Editor, The Pitt News:

After four years at- Pitt, I still
fail to see any signs of a Student
Government. I realize that we do
have a Student Council that pro-
motes the type of program that
a young men’s ——— young women’s
association might have.

I expect a Student Govern-
ment to have representatives
working with the administration,
faculty and the Board of Trus-
tees iri forming the policy for
the University. -

In other words I believe that
the interests of the students
should have just as much or
more “weight” as those of the
faculty in policy decisions of the
University. (I will admit that un-
der the present administration
some faculty members would say
that the student is equal; the
“weight” is zero in both cases.)

I have been under the impres-
sion that the main purpose of the
University is to serve the stu-
dent. Then-should not the stu-
c.ent be consulted on policy mat-
ters? But we don’t have a Stu-
dent Government for the other
branches of the University to
consult. \

An example of this lack of
Student Government was ‘the
latest action of the Board of
Trustees in raising the Univers-

.ity fee by 100 per cent. I assume
that no ‘thought was given to
consulting with the president or

other representatives of Student »

Government Association for the

views of the students on this

increase. 

H ' ' In7”fact, I‘  that .noi:oné.”

 

in the student Council even knew
about this action until the Pitt
News received the story. This
shows what the “policy makers”
think of SGA or the Student
Council (after -all we‘ don’t ask
a washing
thinks).
‘Now I don’t expect. the YMCA
to ‘protest this action, but _I did
expect the president of the Stu-
dent Council to protest this ac-
tion of the board.. I-do hope -that

. someday our Student Council As-
sociation will become a Student ’

Government Association.

Salk Hall Conditions
Termed Pretty Ratty
Editor, The Pitt News: ’

lg Occasionally a bad situation
becomes so bad that it can no
longer be tolerated. Such is the
case with the rats and mice of
Salk Hall. Mice can be cute, but
these_ mice are simply dirty.

"Mice are present in droves, A,

‘on the floor of the grain receiv-

ing room, and there were prob-
ably many more which were
hidden. It is extremely unpleas-
ant to wake up to find a mouse
sharing your bed.

Under each radiator the ad-
ministration thoughtfully pro-
vides, a container of poison, but
these the mice ignore in favor
of the plentiful grain on the

the chickens, monkeys, "etc. are

Bill Hamilton, Panther co-

_jninth inning with one man
out when Duquesne’s center

ﬁelder, Leo Wilson, hit a 20-

foot single along the third base
_ line which could not be’ ﬁelded.

It was I-lamilton’s second one-
hit performance in a row and up-

, Bill Kaliden then hit a line. drive
which Wilson dropped for a two-

score.

Schoeppner led the Panthers’ 15

two runs batted in. Two of the
three hits were doubles, one com-
ing with the bases loaded.

Nick Kartsonas, who. smashed

a home run, Kaliden, Ron Maser,

on the losing end of each of the

them, 131,é~7 1/2, while
