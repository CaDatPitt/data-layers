When most students drop their
iPhones, a long process of ﬁnding
a replacement or someone to ﬁx
the device ensues. But Dylan Bax-
endell sees it as an opportunity, at
a rate of two students per week.
After Baxendell, a senior ma-
joring in athleticntraining, dropped
his phone and had not purchased
AppleCare+ — Apple’s protection
plan for the company’s devices,
he became interested in repair-
ing mobile devices. He decided
to watch a YouTube video from
iFixit.com, a repair guide website,
to learn how to ﬁx the screen.
For many, these videos serve as
a great solution, and Baxendell de-
cided to cash in on this newfound
opportunity. Offering his repair
services to fellow Pitt students
and members of the Pittsburgh
community in exchange for cash,
Baxendell has been able to ﬁnan-
cially support himself throughout
college for costs such as food and
utilities. On a typical week, Bax-
endell said he serves about two
clients, drawing interested cus-
tomers through advertising and

Following a sweep of inspections,
two Oakland restaurants have
been cited for violations by the
Allegheny County Health Depart-
ment. 1.

The Allegheny County Health
Department issued citations to Su-
shi Boat Asian Kitchen and The
Bagel Factory on Feb. 18 and Feb.
24, respectively. .

Sushi Boat Asian Kitchen, lo-

cated at 128 Oakland Ave., was
cited last Tuesday for numerous
critical violations of the county’s
Food Safety Rules and Regulations.

The county’s Food Safety As-
sessment Reports cited Sushi Boat

for critical violations of the code,

including a lack of protection of
foods from cross—contamination,

 poorpersonal hygiene, presence of ‘

rat droppings and dead rodents on
the premises, improper storage of
toxic items and cooked food being
kept at unsafe temperatures.

       
   

     

Sushi Boat has been closed
since the Health Department is-
sued the report.

The owners of Sushi Boat had
not responded to a request for
comment at the time of publica-
tion.

As consumers ramp up their spending
on touch—screen devices, the number of
smashed screens is also increasing. Ac-
cording to MobileInsurance.co.uk, a mobile
phone insurance website, about a quarter
of all iPhone owners have cracked or dam-
aged displays on their phones. While going

straight back to the phone’s manufacturer '

for repairs has been the most conventional
solution in the past, other options have
recently proven to be valuable, as well.
Baxendell, who has been doing phone
repairs for roughly three years, said he
started out by helping friends whose

screens broke. In the past year, his knack _

for phone repair grew into a business.

Baxendell said when he ﬁrst started his
business, he had a tough time getting used
to repairing devices. ‘

“I have to admit, I was terrible when I
ﬁrst started doing my own phone repairs.
But now I’ve learned so much over the
years. It’s just second—nature now,” he said.

While screen repair isn’t rocket science,
the task is tedious.

“Doing repairs is something that takes
patience and practice, like anything else
you do in life. For something like an iPhone
4 [or] 4S screen repair, I will be taking out
about 30 to 40 very tiny screws and mostly
all the internal components of the phone
just to get the front screen off,” Baxendell
said. “Then the whole phone needs to be
reassembled. It’s a lot to keep track of.”

Because of the complicated nature of
the repairs, Baxendell limits the different
kinds of phones he ﬁxes to iPhones and
Samsung Galaxy devices.

Pricing on his repairs varies depending
on different factors.

“The phone’s make and model are the
biggest factor on price. It also depends on
how much the replacement part costs,”
Baxendell said. “Other factors include the
time it will take me to complete it, and also
if they want anything extra like a change
of screen color or buttons.”

Baxendell also said if there was an issue
with the repair or if he accidentally broke

a part of the phone, he would take full re-
sponsibility and purchase a replacement
part or an entirely new phone for the client.

“I’m an honest guy and would never re-
turn a phone that isn’t functional,” he said.

For a screen repair for an iPhone 4 or
4S, Baxendell said he would charge about
$45 or $50. For an iPhone 5, he’d charge
$75 to $80. The difference in price is be-
cause of the cost of replacement parts in
each device.

“Absolutely not,” Kane said.
Cellhelmet’s real protection comes from
the company’s one-year guarantee of acci-
dental damage coverage for the customer’s

sions of the iPhone and the iPod Touch.
Prices range from $34.99 for a case for an

takes patience and practice, like
anything else you do in |ife."

Baxendell’s business has some com-
petitors.

“As far as competition goes, there are .

a lot of options out there. You have your
manufacturers like Apple and Sarn§ung,”
Baxendell said. “Then below that you have
repair shops all over Pittsburgh who em-
ploy people to do repairs on various devices
and individuals such as myself looking to
earn a little extra money on the side.”

One such competitor is Cellhelmet, a
cell phone case manufacturer and repair
service that opened a new location at 3601
Forbes Ave. about two weeks ago.

Mike Kane, a Pitt-Iohnstown alumnus
who graduated in 2005, and Dave Artuso,
who graduated from Penn State in 2011,
teamed up to form the company. The pair
was featured on ABC’s reality television
show “Shark Tank,” which provides en-
trepreneurs an opportunity to pitch their
ideas to a team of potential investors, in
March 2013. .

On the episode, the two men stood be-
fore a team of potential investors as Kane
asked, “Are we saying that our Cellhelmet
cases can withstand all kinds of crazy
abuse?”

As Kane asked his question, Artuso si-
multaneously slammed an iron club down

iPod Touch to $49.99 for an iPhone 5 case.

According to Kane, each time a. cus-
tomer’s phone is damaged while inside a
Cellhelmet case, the customer can send
the device to the companyto be repaired
or replaced, depending on the severity of
the damage. After paying a $50 handling
fee, Cellhelmet will send the device back to
the customer within three business days.

Kane said Cellhelmet’s main selling
point is that customers can get unlimited
repairs within one year of the case’s pur-
chase for most physical damage that oc-
curs to the device. This damage includes
a cracked screen, a broken speaker ora
faulty headphone jack, but excludes repair
coverage for water damage and scratched
aluminum. In the instance of something
such as water damage, the customer must
use their one allotted device replacement.

This may be a cost-effective alternative
for an iPhone user that plans on purchas-
ing Apple’s popular warranty for iPhones,
AppleCare+.

According to Apple’s website, Apple
products come with one year of hardware
repair coverage through its limited war-
ranty and up to 90 days of complimentary
support.

However, once the warranty is up, Apple

users are not guaranteed repair support.
Customers can choose to purchase AppleC-
are+, which provides an additional year of
repair support.

Customers must pay an initial fee of $99
for AppleCare+, which will then allow cus-

tomers two incidents of accidental damage

repair at a $79 service fee for each incident.
Other phone manufacturers, such as
HTC, promise to provide customers with a
free one-time screen replacement on devic-
es within the ﬁrst sixmonths of ownership.
But while HTC’s screen-replacement
guarantee is limited to only HTC custom-
ers, Cellhelmet’s services aren’t limited
to just those who have bought one of the
company’s cases.

According to Kane, Cellhelmet offers

walk-in repair service for any type of cell

’ phone or tablet, and a team of certiﬁed

technicians will be able to. perform most
repairs on the spot. ' .

“We typically ask that you give us an
hour to do a repair. Most repairs are done
in half that time,” Kane said.

UN report on North Korea

demands international action

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

Behind North Korea’s military
goose-walk parades, nuclear-
charged rhetoric and chubby
dictator sporting a pantsuit lies
a real-life-dystopian novel. -
According to a recently re-
leased report mandated by the
United Nations Human Rights
Council, the state of North Ko-
rea currently has the social ri-
gidity of “Brave New World” and
the state—organized , physical

and psychological oppression of ‘

“1984.” Of course, this may not
be surprising to some. North
Korea is, after all, a totalitarian
state, and totalitarian states tend‘
to specialize in arbitrary power.
That’s just what they do. However,
it’s the nitty-gritty details of the
long—awaited U.N. report that will
hopefully make the globe more
aware of what we are allowing to
take place in our international
community and potentially spur
a global response.

The report is not pretty. All
Dennis Rodman and Kimjong-un
jokes aside, the North Korean re-
port_has presented the world with
an unprecedented human-rights
issue that is quickly approaching

the same level of magnitude as S

Darfur and parallels the abuses
committed by Nazi Germany.
We are facing a situationwhere
more than iO0,000 men, wom-
en and children are locked up in
state-run concentration camps
in which torture, starvation and
murder are commonplace in the
daily lives of the inmates. One
of the testimonies given to the
U.N. panel by one of the few sur-
vivors of the North Korean prison

camp system describes awoman
being forced to drown her own
baby. Others recount systematic
torture, rape, forced abortions,

. infanticide and deliberate starva-

tion of children.
When not in the camps, the

« lives of the North Korean people

are still completely controlled by
the will of the state. The state de-
cides where one lives, where one
gets educated (if at all) and even
whom one can marry, depend-
ing on the historical “loyalty” of
a particular family. And it con-
solidates this power to control the
population via food distribution
— in much the same way Stalin
did during his regime —— by delib-
erately starving dissidents and re-
warding dedication to the regime
with food. Thus, if your family, is
deemed politically loyal, the state
will provide for you. If not, your
life is a socially and economically
isolated hell.

Furthermore, absolutely no
one has access to any information
from outside of the regime. All
media is controlled by the Work-
ers’ Party, which denies freedom
of thought, expression and reli-
gion and indoctrinates citizens
from birth to follow its ideological
agenda. Deviating from approved
media results in harsh punish-
ment: The report outlines cases
in which families are tortured for
merely watching foreign soap op-
eras. Consequently, these kinds of
disincentives to engage in curi-
osity, along with the state media
monopoly, have successfully cre-
ated a cult of personality around
the supreme leader.

Conclusively, all of these Nazi-
esque human-rights atrocities
described inthe U.N. report are

. the result of the highest-proﬁle

international attempt to inves-
tigate the activities of the North
Korean regime, thus providing an
expert conﬁrmation to some of
the rumors that have been ﬂoating
around the public sphere for years
now. This is fantastic, because
the plight of the North Korean
people deserves international at-
tention — but how can the globe
respond?

The report urges for a referral
by the U.N. Security Council to
the International Criminal Court
or the establishment of an ad hoc
tribunal to hold the accused per-
petrators, including Kim Jong-
un, accountable for their crimes

I against the North Korean people.

However, China, North Korea’s
sole ally and permanent member
of the Security Council, will most
likely obstruct any attempt by the
U.N. to refer the nation’s leaders
to the ICC.

There is also, of course, the '

fact that North Korea is currently
under the stewardship of a com-
pletely autonomous leader who
could launch a nuclear weapon
toward Seoul, South Korea, at
any time if threatened. So that
also obviously undermines any
international response.
Therefore, it is unfortunately
unlikely that any of the recom-
mendations outlined in the re-
port will come to fruition, because
again, being on the Security Coun-
cil, China has veto power against
any U.N. decision and no real
incentive —— besides the seem-
ingly obvious moral one — to go
against their regional and ideo-
logical ally. And any foreign in-

cursion by another state on North Korean
territory, even a targeted relief effort, could
result in a disastrous response from an
unpredictable ruler. "

Yet there is still hope for the North
Korean people, and I think it stems from
nongovernmental organizations such as
Amnesty International and Human,Rights
Watch. What these organizations need to

do is play the role of global whistleblower

V by putting unrelenting pressure on the

U.N. to act. The U.N.’s legitimacy as a global
peacemaker has already been questioned
in the past because of its slow reaction to
the crises in Rwanda and Darfur. If it fails
to act in North Korea, nongovernmental

organizations need to present this as yet —

another blow to U.N. legitimacy. Evenif
China does not agree about the most op-
timal route of action, a compromise must
be made to at least beginlto chip away at
the hold North Korea has over its people.

As the Human Rights Watch group stat-
ed: “The U.N. was set up in the aftermath of
the second World War precisely to address
this kind of massive abuse. The atrocities
described in this report are a profound

I challenge to the founding ideals of the U.N.
‘and should shock the organization into

bold action.” _ .__
KAI do not believe the U. N.  afford to let
this report go by the wayside, for its own

- sake and for the sake of the North Korean

people. There is simply too much evidence

zations will not let the issue drop if the U.N.
does. Therefore, when the panel formally
presents its ﬁndings to the U.N.’s Human
Rights Council next month, a decision, for
action must be made with China on board.

Michael Kirby, chairman of the Com-
mission of Inquiry, sums it up perfectly:
“At the end of the second World War, so
many people said, ‘If we only had known.’

Well nowrthe international community

does know. ... There will be no excusing

failure of action because we didn’t know.”

Most who walk by_ and read the sign, “Pizza
not ﬂat anymore,” will likely be curious as to
exactly what that means. The answer might
surprise them more than the sign, itself.

Right on Forbes Avenue in the heart
of Squirrel Hill sits Pizza Cono, a recently
opened pizza shop that serves the clas-
sic staples that make up most,pizza—shop
menus.

As employee Jared Runnels explained,
the process for making a pizza cone involves
a cone press designed by Pizza Cono that
takes their homemade dough and forms
it into the perfect shape. After the cone is

formed, alternating layers of cheese, top-
pings and sauce ﬁll the cone to capacity.
After it is stuffed, the cone is entered into a
custom-made rotation oven for 7 minutes.
Once cooled, the pizza cone is ready to go.

“When laid out ﬂat, it’s about [the size
of] a large slice,” said Runnels.

The shop’s menu also offers a number
of dessert cones made from fresh pastry
dough, including the Caramel Apple Pie
cone and the _Tiramisu cone. Owners are

hoping to start selling a new Nutella cone

in the near future.
Pizza Cono manager Jamal Hamdan

said that the pizza cone concept has been
a work in progress for the last seven years.
He acknowledges the growing number of
pizza cone shops in Europe, especially in
Italy, however, he likes to see himself as a
trendsetter here in the United States.

“We have been really busy since we
ﬁrst opened. People are curious to ﬁnd out
what a pizza cone is,” said Hamdan, not—
ing that the idea isn’t quite so strange as it
ﬁrst seems.

“A lot of people ask us how exactly to eat
it. It’s simple.Just like an ice cream cone,”
he said. ﬁi

BEER NERD

The Beer Nerd’s guidetobeer-drin-kingetiquette

Jackson Crowder
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

The proliferation of craft brewing in America
has given rise to a new species of hobbyist:
the beer nerd.

I happily count myselfamong these ranks,
but the journey to proper nerd was fraught
with peril ofboth the social and physical vari-
ety. Fortunately forall of you burgeoningbeer
nerds out there, following these three pieces
of advice will help you transition nicely into
your new passion, relatively free of embar-
rassment —— or black eyes.

The ﬁrst and foremost rule of beer nerd
etiquette is this: A party is no place for snob-
bery. Sure, Bud, Miller and Coors taste like
sewer water. You know it. I know it. We all
know it. That, however, does not mean that
it is honorable to turn one down at a party.
Note that a BYO party is a completely sepa-

rate animal — one that, by its very nature,
allows you to sip on Whatever you please.
But a party where the host has gone out
of his or her way to provide their guests
with beer is no place for" your newfound
pride in your palate to rear its ugly head.
I can rememberbeing ataHalloween party -—-D
recently enough for me to have known better
—- where I committed just such an offense.
Rather than graciously accepting the host’s
offering, Ivstuck to drinking Dogﬁsh Head
60 minute IPA from the bottle, a beer sin in
and of itself. When the host kindly said that
I could help myselfto the available selection
‘ at the house, I scoffed, expounding Dogﬁsh
Head’s virtues and talking high—minded1y
about how light beer was ruining the world
(which, to be fair, it is).
Justiﬁably, this made me avery unpopular

The band Red Hook‘Winery began
 4., long beforethey could enjoy their
. , first bottle of wine together.

Vocalistalnd guitarist Kian Mc?
Collum, lead guitarist Joe Krafc-

.zynski and bassist Tom Huketich
. met and beganperforming music

together in third-grade choir. Years
later, as seniors in high school, the

. trio hooked up with drummer Steve

Archer and keyboardist and vocal-
ist Kara Laus for their first gig at a

school talent show. They’ve been re-

fining their difﬁcult—to-categorize
sound ever since.
“We’ve jokingly thrown around

that we are creatures of oddrock,
which is aitotally made—up genre,”
said Krafcfzynski, ta Pitt senior, of
,the band’s_“style. _ . 
’In‘s'tead*of resorting to other;pre-

"iexisting genre names, he saidthat,
_ “If you tookThe Beatles, Tower of
,3 Power, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Deli-
‘““7catefSteve and Regina Spektor and

put them together, you would get
us, I suppose.” '

Krafczynski says the band plans
to stick together after college, if it

I seems natural to them.

“I think, at some level, we all
want to keep doing this and be able
to pay the bills with it  as long as
we all stay reasonably close and it
still feels right,” he said.

For now, the band is simply look-
ing ahead to recording its next EP
and a single of one of its new songs,
“Tunnel of Love.”

party guest and one who did not stick around
for very long. So when confronted with the
same situation, don’t do as I did. Take the free
beer and smile. Don’t be a jerk.

The second rule of beer etiquette is that,
unless you’re going out to a bar speciﬁcally for
its great beer selection, don’t spend your night
whining about what you’re drinking. When go-
ing to a bar with friends, it’s a worthwhile ex-
ercise to consider the kind of bar you’d like to
visit. A dance bar, for example will likely have
a rather weak beer selection as compared to a
sports bar. Make sure to appropriately adjust
your expectations of the bar’s beer varieties —
it will save you much pain and embarrassment.

. Do not, underany circumstances, berate
the bartender for an establishments poor
selection. For one, the bartender probably
had about as much to do with choosing the
beer selection as you did, so it’s not their fault
the bar doesn’t carry Le Fin du Monde on tap.

More importantly, arguing with a bar-
tender is a sureﬁre way to be “asked to leave,”
which I promise is even less fun than it sounds.
Chances are that your local watering hole will
have Yuengling bottles ora seasonal Sam Ad-
ams draft, both of which are perfectly good.
Again, don’t make myvmistakes and learn
when it is and is not advisable to complain.
Keep your powder dry forwhen someone tells
you that the new Miller Fortune is better than
Fat Head’s Head Hunter.

Finally, don’t rush into being a hop head
just to show off to your beer nerd friends -
let your love of hops grow naturally. Liking
anything that is inherently unlikable takes
time. Hops are bitter and spicy, packingﬂavors
that are entirely new, and can be off—putting
to a new beer drinker. Just because someone
at your local bar (who might have been me)
told you how great Sierra Nevada Torpedo
double IPA is does not mean that you should
go out and buy a case of it. If you’re starting
to explore the Sam Adams varieties, which is
an excellent place to start, please don’t feel
pressure to raise your hop game in order to
impress someone else.

As you may have guessed at this point, I’ve
also made this mistake. I had seen Dogﬁsh
Head advertised around my hometown, and
people whoknew a bit about beer seemed to
think it was good. So when I got my case of

in which he lives, but he gives in to modern
tastes with the smooth electronics on the
simple, synth-heavy “Unforgiven,” a trans-
ﬁxing, ponderously paced pseudo-jazz
piece. The prominent strings are utilized
to great length as the only instruments on
“Cycle” and “Phase” and paired with just
Beck’s voice on “Waves,” an engagingly
eerie but lyrically heavy-handed ballad.
During the latter half of the album,
Beck refuses to lose steam by switching
gears to folk—focused sounds, free of the
annoying hipsterism that has plagued

folk’s current revival. Instead, the pleas-

ant ease of “Don’t Let It Go”, the sprightly
melodies from “Blackbird Chain” and
the indie-soundtrack—ready loveliness of
“Turn Away” are all endearing, hearty and

transporting. Even the southern—inspired

“Country Down” is conﬁdently performed
and sports Beck’s admirable harmonica
skills.

Beck, in order to match the more pow-
erful moments of Sea Change, goes grandi-
ose on sweeping and emotional tracks such

as “Blue Moon” and the climactic ﬁnale

A “Waking Light.” Both feature the best lines

on the album, including textured images
such as Beck’s description of “the song-
bird calling across the water outside my
asylum,” compensating for the relatively
unmemorable lyrics as compared to the
strangely poetic nonsense of most of his
previous work. A A -V L  .. i  i_ A

Pitt freshman Lolade Ogungbesan was a bit
nervous boarding the plane to the United
States last fall. Even though she had attended
a foreign tennis academy and her mother
accompanied her on the plane to the U.S.,
her nerves still rose. .
f‘In Spain,;Iv;c9Ul§l:;39 ih°_.F!1.§;-Qn the week-
ends,” said  fresh-
man tennis player from "London, England.
“Going to the United States, I knew that I

i wouldn’t get to see my parents at all. I also

knew I would be really j et lagged, and it would
be hard to settle in.”

After Ogungbesan’s mother helped her
move in to her dorm and get adjusted, they
said their goodbyes. Ogungbesan was a
strangerin astrange land, having never been
to America before.

But-it didn’t take long for her teammates
to take to the foreign underclassman.

“My teammates have really‘ been taking
care of me,” said Ogungbesan, currently 11-4
in her matches this season. “In the very ﬁrst
week, I would hang out with a few of them,
and they would show me around Pittsburgh.
They’ve been so welcoming in helping me
adjust here.”

While she says that she has experienced
homesickness on some occasions, Ogung-
besan’s teammates and coaches alike have
viewed her transition as seamless.

“I thought it would really be a lot more
work to show her around, but she’s really
taken the reins,” redshirt sophomore Kath-
erine Castro said. “She’s now one of my best
friends here at Pitt.”

Ogungbesan is tied for the team lead with 11 wins. | Photo courtesy Pitt Athletics

Headcoach Alex Santos, who is in his
ﬁrst year as head coach after coaching at the
University of Miami, agreed with Castro’s
sentiments.

“Lolade is such an amazing girl,” Santos

Ogungbesan making adjustments, impact in first year

said. “She’s done a great job adjusting to a
new country, and it’s deﬁnitely helped that
she’s had some experience in that.”

Ogungbesan spent four years at the San-
chez-Casal Academy in Spain. The school is
one of the most prestigious tennis academies
in the world, with notable alumni such as
two—time Grand Slam winner Andy Murray.

Oglmgbesan is grateful for her experience
there, and credits it for aiding in her transi-
tion into the life of a student—athlete.

» “It was a really good experience. The
routine was very similar to what student-
athletes do at Pitt. We would wake up early
in the morning and practice and go to class
afterwards,” she said. “If I didn’t go there, it
would have been a lot harder at Pitt.”

Despite the routine’ similarities, Ogung-
besan cites some differences between the
two environments.

“It’s harder here. [Coach Santos] is more
intense than my coaches in Spain,” she said.
“We played longer when I was in Barcelona,
but here it’s much more intense.”

She also noted how surprised she was at
how seriously people take collegiate sports
here in the United States, and said she was
shocked attending her ﬁrst Pitt basketball
game.

Ogungbesan has shown no signs of trouble
transitioning on the court. She is tied for the

WRESTLING ,

Panthersfocused on continuing success into postseason

Dustin Gabler
'Sej2z'or Stayj’ Wrz'ter

_ About two years ago, when Pitt announced

thatit would soon be moving itsathletic
teams to’ the ACC, the conversation cen-
tered on football and basketball, but the
Pitt wrestling team was also preparing to
make a step up.

The Panthers had been a member of the
Eastern Wrestling League until the 2013-

2014 season, when they transitioned to the .

ACC. -

Both conferences typically sent about the
same number of wrestlers to the national
tournament —- the best way to compare

conferences — so when Pitt left the EWL,
the league took a hit while the ACC received
a boost.

Although the qualiﬁer allocations —
the number of wrestlers at each weight
class who automatically qualify for NCAAs
from each conference — have yet to be an-

A nounced, it’s‘ safe to say that the ACC will

earn more automatic bids than the EWL
this year. ' '

“The EWL was tough,” senior heavy-
weight P.]. Tasser said. “But competing in
the ACC was great. It’s leading our program
in the right direction.”

Friday, Pitt completed its perfect ACC
season, going 6-0 in the conference after a

22-12 victory at North Carolina.

Coming into the season, the Panthers
weren’t going to be happy with anything
but an outright championship. They claimed
three‘ of the last four regular-season titles
in the EWL. '

“After the success the team has had in
_past years, conference titles are what we
all work for,” senior 133—pounder Shelton
Mack said. “The coaches have done a great
job making that a priority anda mindset.”

For the upperclassmen who had grown
used to seeing the same EWL schools, this
season has exposed them to new opponents,
new arenas and new styles.

“It’s good to wrestle these different

schools and see different opponents,” senior
125-pounder Anthony Zanetta said. “You see
a lot of different styles with each team, and
that prepares us more and more.”

It prepares them for the tournaments
that are coming up on the schedule, as well.
The Panthers head to Blacksburg, Va., for
the ACC tournament on March 8. At that
tournament, several Panthers will look to
clinch their trips to the NCAA Champion-
ships in Oklahoma City, Okla.

For now, the wrestlers’ goals have shifted
to winning an individual ACC title and what
that individual title would represent —- a

Pitt on the ‘bubble’ with four games left

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Maryland head coach Mark Turgeon called
the Pitt a “top-ﬁve” team after the Panthers
defeated his Terrapins in College Park, Md.,
a month ago. At the time, his point seemed
sound.

Pitt had lost only twice when Pitt played
Maryland on Jan. 25: ﬁrst by ﬁve points at
then—No. 2 Syracuse and a second time by
one on a shot with seconds remaining at
Madison Square Garden to a Cincinnati
team that rose as high as seventh in the
nation’s rankings.

The losses kept coming, and a month
to the date of that victory against the Ter-
rapins, the Panthers are mired in a three-
game losing streak. To boot, they’ve won
just twice in the past month and are 4-6 in
their last 10 games.

Don’t forget that two of those wins came
against Miami and Virginia Tech, with the
Panthers needing overtime to avoid an up-
set in Coral Gables, Fla., and two overtime
periods to defeat the league’s worst team
at home.

Now the Panthers (20-7, 8-6 ACC) have
fallen into a tie for ﬁfth place with Clemson
and are just 1.5 games ahead of ninth-place
Florida State.

The team Turgeon and other coaches
hailed as one of the nation’s best or most
underrated teams received zero votes in
the AP Top 25 poll after the Panthers lost
to Florida State Sunday —— Pitt’s worst loss
of the season.

With just four games remaining in Pitt’s
season, it’s time to make judgments based
off what has been seen and not heard.
Whether it’s head coach Jamie Dixon not
making “excuses” for his team’s recent play
or the masses extolling Pitt’s virtues be-
cause the Panthers’ only losses came against
ranked teams until Sunday, put those ideas
to rest.

Because right now, Pitt is on the bubble.

ESPN.co‘m bracketology expert Joe
Lunardi projects Pitt as a No. 10 seed in
this year’s Big Dance, but not even that is a
guarantee, because according to Eamonn
Brennan, purveyor of ESPN.com’s “Bubble
Watch,” Pitt resides in the category of a team
with “work left to do.”

Brennan wrote that before Pitt’s loss
Sunday, which began the team’s run into the
ﬁnal stretch of the regular season’.

The Panthers followed up an eight-day
break with a dud against Florida State, a
team that had lost seven of its last 10 games
before the Seminoles arrived in Pittsburgh.

Beginning with Florida State, the Pan-
thers are now in an eight-day stretch in
which they play four games —- at Boston

College Wednesday, at Notre Dame Satur-'

day, their ﬁnal home contest next Monday
against North Carolina State and at Clemson
the following Saturday.

Boston College (7-20, 3-11 ACC) and
Notre Dame (14-14, 5-10 ACC) reside near
the bottom of the conference, but the
Golden Eagles accomplished something Pitt

couldn’t do in two tries by defeating Syra-
cuse. Let’s also not forget that the Fighting
Irish always seem to play their best game of
the season against the Panthers. Meanwhile,
NC State (17-10, 7-7 ACC) is just a game be-
hind the Panthers in the league standings.

The Panthers have four chances to play
off the bubble with no margin for error. A
loss in any of their ﬁnal four games would be
a bad one and enough to knock the Panthers
into heavy contention for a seed in the Na-
tional Invitation Tournament, as opposed to
an invitation to partake in March Madness.

In the 11th hour of their ﬁrst season as
ACC members, the Panthers are reeling
—— and they have four games to stop the
bleeding. I

trip to the national tournament.

“Personally, not winning an ACC title
would be a failure in my eyes,” Zanettasaid.
“I have the potential to not only win the ACC,
but to dominate. That’s what my goal is.”

Pitt will be chasing its fourth-straight
conference tournament championship. The
Panthers won the EWL Tournament title in
2011, 2012 and 2013. '

As the No. 10 dual-ranked team, Pitt was
the highest-ranked ACC squad in the rank-
ings, which order schools based on their
performances in dual meets. The Panthers
are ranked No. 18 by Intermat in tournament
rankings, which projects how teams will fare
at tournaments.

Both No. 14 Maryland and N o. 16 Virginia
rank higher than Pitt in these rankings, be-
cause they both have a top-two wrestler in
a weight class.

With the regular season in the rearview
mirror, Pitt shifts its focus onto a tournament
championship, which won’tbe as easy as the
regular-season title.

“This season was unforgettable, and I’m
proud to have been a part of it,” Tasser said.
“There are deﬁnitely big things to come in
the future for Pitt wrestling.” %

Ogungbesan has met success off the court,
as well. She is a published author, with her
ﬁrst book, “The Little Sunﬂower,” released
when she was 8, and her second book, ‘_‘Bus
65,” being published in 2012.

Her resumé speaks for itself, and despite
her relative unfamiliarity with the University
and the city prior to her recruitment, she said
she feels fortunate to be at Pitt.

Ogungbesan is hoping to major in some
branch of science, and said her academic as-
pirations factored into her decision to attend
the University. - ‘

“I hadheard of it once before. I did a lot of
research online,” she said. “What attracted me
the most was the combination of the sports
facilities and the science courses. It’s such a
well-rounded school.”

In just one semester, Ogungbesan has
become an integral part of the Pitt Panthers’,

   

,women’s tennis team, having garnered the

respect, admiration and friendship of her
teammates.

“She works really hard,” Castro said. “I
don’t even think of her as an underclassman. 3
