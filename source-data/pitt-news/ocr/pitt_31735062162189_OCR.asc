Draft Delinquents Prosecutecl Legislature Sends Death

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Students who have not_ signed up
for the draft within the 60 day
period of their 18th birthday may
face criminal action by the
Selective Service Board for evasion
of the draft, and be subjected to
ﬁnes up to $10,000 and imprison-
ment of not more than five years.

Assistant US Attorney David M.
in charge , of Selective

Service affairs in western Pennsyl-
vania, said the offense was far
more serious than most people
realized. “This is criminal, it’s a
felony, and it may be enough to bar
a person from a job in the future.
No one has been sentenced yet, but
some courts may take a very harsh
view of the offense.” .
According to Curry, offenders
were at. one time able to avoid
prosecution by enlisting. However,

ACLU Supports Amnesty
‘Coll from Ex-Army Chief

BY BILL HADUCK

Former Army Secretary Robert
F. Froehlke’s suggestion that
Congress legislate blanket condi-
tional amnesty for Vietnam war
draft evaders, has been called “an
important first §tep toward devel-
oping a ‘policy of unconditional
universal amnesty,” by American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
Associate Director Arlie Schardt.

Schardt said Froehlke’s “forgive
and forget” attitude reflects that of
a growing number of American
people. “They’re increasing
steadily,” he said, “The polls are
already showing a majority of
people favoring a conditional type
amnesty, and at least one third
wanting an unconditional amnes-
ty.n I

According to Captain Terrance
Ford of the Army Recruiting Main
Station in Pittsburgh, however,
army people have different ideas.
“If you polled the army, I’m pretty
sure most would be against
amnesty." Even so, Froehlke’s
suggestions may be signiﬁcant, he
says. “It’-sjust conjecture, but his
opinion might carry some weight.”

According to published reports,
Froehlke, in a split with President
Nixon, told a House judiciary
subcommittee considering amnesty
legislation that amnesty should be
granted now “because the draft
and the killing is over” and
because America should be strong
enough to forgive its young men
who made a mistake.

State Selective Service Director
Bob Ford said, “Personally I’m
opposed to it. No one had to go
underground to escape the draft.
All they had to do was face the
penalties. People who left the
country avoided both going to war

and ,facing the penalties.” ‘

He attributed some of his logic to
Thoreau, saying, “People have to
recognize that when you take a
stance against the government, you
have to suffer the consequences.”

Director Ford said he might
consider agreeing with a case-by-

_C3-5_e'tyipe 3-mIle§lZ.y like that Of'tl'1e_'- 1 .1  :»  ;.«~‘  photo: 

post-Korean War period in which
each case was considered separ-
ately by an amnesty board. “Back
then, we tried to make sure that
everyone was treated equally.

“We're a nation of laws, not
men,” he continued, “If they (draft
evaders) feel strongly for their
causes, part of this is accepting the
penalty, for breaking a federal
law.”

changes in the induction procedure
have left these people without the
enlistment alternative, leaving
them open to indictment and
conviction.

“A man who registers late,”
said Curry, “must give his reasons
in writing, and if the local draft
boards don’t believe him, if they
feel it was intentional, they can
then start the indictment proce-
dure.”

According to Curry, even people
registering one day after the
expiration of their 60 day limit are
in violation of thelaw. He noted
any such technical offender can
legally be tried and convicted.

According to the office _of US
Attorney Richard L. Thornburgh,
the Justice Department reports
offenders registering within a year

' of their 18th birthday or prior to the

determination of their random
sequence draft numbers, which
ever is earlier, will not be
prosecuted.

“Why not just register and not
worry about it,” Curry said.
“Draft registration is not a-dirty
word. You have to do it.’ It is a very
serious matter.” . ‘

Penolty Bill to Governor

HARRISBURG AP--The Penn-
sylvania legislature has over-
whelmingly approved a_ measure
reinstating the death penalty for
certain types of murders. .

The bill, sent to Gov. Milton J.
Shapp after a 44-4 Senate vote on
Monday, is intended to satisfy a US
Supreme Court decision which
struck down capital punishment
laws as discriminatory._

Since the June 1972 ruling 22,
states have rewritten their laws

with most making the death
sentence mandatory for specific
killings.

Shapp says he is personally
opposed to execution and has said
he would never put a person to
death while governor. But he said
last year he could sign a death
penalty bill because of public
pressureifor it. s

The measure, which cleared the '

House 169-19 last week, sets
execution by electric chair for nine
specific intentional murders.

These include killing of a police-

Richardson Sees Bright Future for GOP

Former Attorney General Elliot
Richardson maintains that despite
Watergate and its resultant trauma
the Republican party can reestab-
lish itself as the majority party in
American politics.

Speaking to a large crowd of
business executives at the School of
General Studies’American Exper-
ience Lecture Series Tuesday,
Richardson said, “If the Republi-
can party addresses the American
people with the idea of establishing
a constituency with a focus on
individual needs, then we can

    
  

. Elliot Richardson

 

indeed become the majority par-
tyon

Richardson said the relationship
of the individual to a complex and
confusing governmental process is
one of the most pressing issues
confronting public ofﬁcials.

Historical precedent identifies
the Republican party as the logical

.champion of those Iindividual

concerns, Richardson maintained.

“The Republican party was born
out of a concern for the individual
and that heritage.has carried_on.”

Richardson said because of
Watergate the Republicans have
missed many opportunities in the
last 12 months to address these
individual interests. »

He expressed his belief however,
that Watergate will,not continue to
impeed progress in this area.

“I am conﬁdent Watergate will
end. It will of course leave
scars--how deep it is impossible to
forecast. But, there is no reason
why the party should be affected by
the stain of Watergate. The party
has not been involved.”

Richardson sees new opportun-
ities for theiparty if they are able to
“transcend the stereotypes and
effectively address those capacities_
which unite rather than divide us.”

This new politics with its
emphasis on the individual will
render obsolete that form of

political appeal which promised,

In response to a question from

Studies at Pitt. cited other possible
reasons for the national decline.
“Many more students are taking
SATs. Students make up their
minds later now and see college as
a possibility. A wide range of
scores could make the difference.

“More students "are taking the
SATs in their junior year than
before. This could cause the
average to decline. There is a
3-5°/oincrease between the junior
and senior years,” she said.

Dean of Admissions Kenneth
Wenger does not feel the decrease
is substantial, adding, “SAT scores
are largely misunderstood. There
is a movement by colleges to look at
them in a different light.
Requirements were a lot rougher
ten years ago than today.

“We use SATs, achievement test
scores and grades when judging an
applicant. If he has poor grades
and poor SATs, we probably won't
take him."

Jones claimed the spread in the
Pitt scores is not terribly signi-
ﬁcant. “The decline could result
from an increase in the acceptance
of high school juniors,” she said.

Wenger noted Pitt is accepting
students earlier than in previous
years and agreed this may be one
of the causes of the lower scores.

What is the future of SATS? “I
don’t know if they will be kept,”
Jones said, “Some students show
more promise in SATs than in other
areas. However, we just completed

research showing that in 1970 and
'71. many Pitt students with high
SAT scores dropped out. We
don't know if it was because of
academic. personal or other prob-
lems.

“There are feelings that SATS are

culturally biased. And there is
always a judgmental factor in-
volved. It's possible that the tests
have less influence than in the
past, and will have even less in the
future. That's what my crystal ball
says. It may be cloudy--I don't
know."

Intromurols, Recreation

Slated for Improvements

BY LEE MARKOVITZ

Two resolutions calling for the
improvement of the intramural and
recreational sports programs were
adopted unanimously by the
University Senate Council Monday.

Specifically, the resolutions call
for the Ad Hoc Committee on
Intramural and Recreational Sports
to report its progress toward
improvement regularly to the
Senate Council beginning June 17.

The University Athletic Com-
mission was requested to “assume
an ongoing advisory, supervisory,
and general ‘watch dog’ posture
toward intramural and recreational
programs." .

Despite growing complaints from
both faculty and students, Athletic
Director Casmir Myslinski said,
“the intramural program-is pro-
gressing." Myslinski cited statis-
tics showing that during the past
ﬁve years, the intramural program

has grown from 15 sports to 23 and
from 3,158 participants to 4.903.

However, he acknowledged a
lack of recreational facilities. “The
big problem is recreational sports--
no question about it,” Myslinski
said. “The recreational program
needs improvement, especially the
problem of proximity of facilities.
We need leisure time recreational
facilities on the lower campus near
the housing area," he said.

Two alternatives being consid-
ered are expanding access to the
Field House to a lower level near
the Dental School and building new
facilities on the lower campus.

When questioned about possible
financial roadblocks, Myslinski
replied, “In a sense, our budget is
open-ended.” Some Fiesta Bowl
revenues will be allocated to the
intramural and recreational sports
programs, he added.

according to Tim Stevens. execu-

Pittsburgh branch.

The NAACP has withstood mili-

politics and regained its stature in
the black community, “because,

the NAACP is the most open, yet,

oldest and most organized ‘of

Disillusionment with the ‘colored

replaced with respect for NAACP’s
longevity and effectiveness,
Stevens said. He believes this
effectiveness will grow as NAACP
leadership continues to attract
younger people and NAACP aims

Stevens said, "Black people go

ﬁve years." The black anger of six
years ago reaffirmed the need for
further reform, and now the
mechanics of what reform must be
implemented. he pointed ‘out.

“The NAACP is the most viable
vehicle we have, and for any black
or white person to stay outside that
vehicle is a denial of sincerity," he
said.

Pitt students wanting to support

good chance to do so this week, as

dozen fronts, including education,
health, housing, labor, publicity,
and women’s rights, in both the
corporate and political Fields.

Editor:

' V The attitude of the Student
' Government Board is to ignore all
"editorial writing which we know to

"* many of our associates
demanded that the truth be known
and, for this reason, we submit the
following letter.

In the Friday, March 8, 1974,
. edition of the Pitt News, an article
 appeared entitled “SG: Operation
~ Secrecy.” The major thrust of the
: editorial was to accuse Student
Government of secrecy in its
_operations.. The writer, Tom
Smith, accused the present Student
A "Government Board of “casting a
9 veil of secrecy over its operations.”
., However, the only incident of
» supposed secrecy that the article
‘referred to was to the Student
Government Board’s Saturday af-
ternoon rap sessions.

The Student Government Board
would now like to explain the
situation to Mr. Smith and rectify
 this ill-conceived "notions. Every
, Saturday, the Student Government
Board gets together in a friendly
atmosphere to discuss what has
- happened in /the past week and
what direction Student Govern-
ment should take in the coming
months. These rap sessions are
-held in addition to our regular
business meetings which occur on
Wednesday nights. Mr. Smith,
himself, stated that “no formal
votes are taken” at these Saturday
. meetings and no business is
_- transacted. All formal business is
’ transacted on Wednesday nights at
I the regular board meetings.

Mr. Smith expressed a great
need for communication and this ,is
exactly what our Saturday meet-
pi ings attempt to foster. By bringing

"the board together in a friendly
atmosphere without the pressure of
news media, etc., board members
can be open with one another and
, say what is on their minds. It

_. Editor:
We call ourselves human: but
what does it mean? We are not all
, the same size, color, sex, religion,
or nationality. Yet there is
 something which we all share: our
I humanity. This “humanness” is
 the essence of what we are. All of
 us share a common evolution--our
 genetic code, our DNA, dictates
 that we are all homo sapiens,
regardless of color, sex, creed,
size, .or age. Black is no less
human than white; the mentally
retarded no less human than the
~ genius; the old no less human than
 the fertilized ovum.

There is an immanent dignity in
our inherent humanity. This basic
' -’ human dignity does not vary with

SGB Reacts to Secrecy Charge ---But 0119 Member

Government President's apartment
or Sunday mornings in Church,
they simply guarantee that each
board member communicate fully
with every other board member to
keep the channels of communica-
tion open and, as Mr. Smith puts it,
to “foster a whole new era of
communication.” Everything dis-
cussed at the Saturday sessions is
re-discussed at the Wednesday
meetings, except that a lot of time
isn't wasted with wild, unworkable
ideas or unclear concepts.

We hope that this explanation
cleared up the cloud of
suspicion that, according to Mr.
Smith, surrounds Student Govern-
ment.

We would now like to clarify
some of the specific half-truths
presented inlthe article. Mr. Smith
mentioned that the Student Gov-
ernment Programming Committee

j “refused to release the speaker’s

fee for the appearance of Robert
Weloh, Chairman of the John Birch
Society.” This was done at the
request of Robert Welch’s booking
agency, who stated that the figures
Student
Government Programming Com-
mittee was faced with the decision
of bringing in the program and not
releasing the figures, or not
bringing in the program at all. We
felt that the student’s desire for
good programming far outweighed
the need of the Pitt News to know
these figures. All other figures
were released except Welch’s
speaking fee. Maybe some people

see the decision as an,error--we‘

do not think that it was. We
welcome comments.

Mr. Smith mentioned that there
is no communication between
Student organizations and the
Student Government Board and
few attempts to encourage student
input. If this is true, how was the
board able to mobilize organiza-
tional support against the time
schedule fee? If there is no
communication, how did the
Student Government Board and the

one human being by another.
From the time our human essence
is formed in the fertilized egg, until
the moment we die, we are human
beings; and no one may trespass on
our dignity, and no one may deny
us our right to life.

Our philosophies will change, our
societies may crumble, and our
cultures may pass away. But so
long as our species perseveres,
humanity endures. We come to
identify human dignity with the
“quality of life"--we must recog-
nize that it is an integral part of

. life. In the ﬁnal analysis, our world

is transient. If humanity is to be
meaningful, we must realize that
when all is reduced, we have got
only one thing--our humanity.

(Note: RSA has succeeded in

ads in the Pitt News asking
students for input concerning the

attempt at communication, why did
Student Government Board mem-
bers interrupt several classes last
week to ask students their opinion

We could go on, but the point is
made. There are many other areas
of the editorial which the board
would like to clarify, but this letter
is already long enough.

Student Government does not, in
any way, shape, or form, attempt to
operate in secret. Our doors (and
windows) are always open to any
ideas or suggestions from anyone.
We attempt to obtain complete
information before making a stand
on any issue or proposal. Only
after complete information is
obtained, can intelligent decisions
be made and intelligent articles
written. We suggest the Editorial
page reporters of the Pitt News
obtain as many facts as possible
before printing a story. Again, the
board would like to state that it is
not the board’s policy to respond td
personal statements in the Pitt

we felt the number of inaccuracies
warranted a response.

Thank you.

  Dissents

Dear Editor,

_ I do not feel that it is the
responsibility of the Student
Government Board to respond to
editorials and opinions of any
publication. If the Student
Government disagrees with an
editorial opinion and feels that the
opinion does" not accurately reflect
the record of the Student Govern-
ment then I feel that the actual
record of the Student Government
will far outweight an editorial of
that record.

If however,
ments concerning

inaccurate state-
the Student

Government are proposed as facts I

in news articles, I firmly believe.
that it is the obligation of the
Student Government Board to
correct those inaccuracies. As long
as I have been a member of the
Student Government Board I have
found no such inaccuracies in any
Pitt News articles.

On a related subject, a great deal
of controversy has arisen since and
because of Tom Smith’s article
entitled “SGB: Operation Sec-
recy” which appeared last Friday,
March 8th. I am gravely concerned
with much of what has been said
since this time. I have been
criticized by some Board members
for being “too friendly” with Tom
Smith. I will not deny that Tom
Smith is a good friend of mine. I
listen to and respect his opinions
and welcome his comments as I do
all students’. Ihave been criticized

for listening “too much” to the

ideas and opinions of Tom Smith.

And I have been -accused by
members of the SG Board and
others of voicing the opinions of
Tom Smith as my own. —The
opinions I voice are mine and if
they sound like the opinions of tom
Smith it is because Tom and I have
the same or similar opinions in
several areas. We also differ in our

.hears cries that

opinions in several areas. With
regard to his article on secrecy
within the SG Board, I disagree
with a good deal of it.

Ido agree with his comment that—

“every other students organization
which programs speakers, is re-
quired to release the costs of their

programs. SG should be no
exception." I will agree that the
questions he raises about the

Board’s closed Saturday meetings
I disagree with his
comment that “no reason exists for
closed board meetings.” It is
necessary for the Board to sit down
once a week in private to discuss
our progress or lack of it. These
closed meetings however have the
dangerous capability-of becoming a
shelter for the Board to decide
policy without input from students
and this is something everyone
should be on constant guard

against.
As for Paul Hertneky’s letter in
the Monday, March 11th Pitt

News, I am in direct disagreement
with many of the things he says and
in particular what he ignorantly
says about Tom Smith; but I’m sure
Torn can defend himself.

The saddest thing that has been
brought more clearly to light
because of the Smith article is the
attitude of "some Board members.
It appears to me that some Board
members live in great _fear of
criticism on the editorial pages.
When articles favorable to Mike
Furick and the Student Govern-
ment appear [such as Smith’s
February 13th article “Crisis gives
New SG lmpetus”] one can hear
from the Student Government
offices of ‘the new and open lines of
communication with the Pitt
News’. When articles critical of
Furick and the Board appear one
‘we created a
monster [i.e. Tom Smith], and that
it [he] must be destroyed’ and that
‘we will get the Pitt News’. This is
the type of attitude that I saw from
the previous Board. I hope that it
will not continue any longer with
this Board. I hope that Mike Furick
will holdto his inaugural statement
that “we must open the windows
and let in some fresh air and let in
some fresh ideas” and that neither
he nor the rest of the Board will
close their minds to the criticisms
of others.

Finally, Mike Furick has decided
to send to the Pitt News a letter on
the subject of Tom Smith’s article.
Although the majority of the Board
agrees with the content of the letter
they have submitted, I do not.
Therefore, for them to sign the
letter ‘Student Government Board’
is incorrect. They should have
signed it with the names of those
members of the Board that agree
with the letter. It is the feeling of
the majority of the Board that there
should be no opposition from the
Board to their letter. This is the

‘type of attitude that I would expect

from a Student Government Board
that wishes to hide different and
varying opinions. This is the type
of attitude I would expect from a
Student Government Board that
wishes to operate closed and
secretly. I hope that the Board
reverses this trend immediately.

Sincerely,
Bruce Keeler.

STUDENTS FOR HUMAN LIFE. Pkoposrs DEBATE

Students for Human Life responds to the letters of Marc Hiller (2/18/74), Cathy Copetas (2/25/74),
and Christina Adachi (an article, Part I, 3/8/74), placed in_'l‘li_e Pitt News. We commend Cathy on her con-
cern, but ask the others why they level vacuous criticism at SHL? To Marc and Cathy we state that $190.00,
precisely, was given to SHL (in our 73-74 budget) by SGB and Allocations Com. for ads. This, our final ad, drains
our account for advertising, for four 5—by10-inch ads. Investigations may be spear-headed through Dean of Student
Affairs who authorized them. Also, our grisly pictures carried a perceptual/cognitive element to stir con-

sciences on an emotive/intellective basis. If the results of suction, D & C, and saline abortions show truth which-

hurts, it is because some fear Pro-Life’s bringing truth to light.

To Christina, we remark that we agree that abortion should not be used for population control; that forced
sterilization should not exist; that racism is bad; and that women should not be guinea pigs. Also, not only
Catholics, but Protestants, Jews, and even Hindus are in Pro-Life. SHL functions on a non-sectarian basis with
anybody. Ms. Adachi, aside from being a crude and confused polemicist, misconstrues Pro-Life’s purpose for
existence. We are totally for women's rights, but condemn those who ignore DNA genetic-type individuation and
morphological differentiation that make the unborn child a unique being, who exists only in geographic symbiosis

' within the woman — which any human embryology text can tell anyone. We laugh at her conception of freedom

without responsibility; only the beasts of the field have that. Any woman has the right to control her own body,
but when any baloney peddler unreflectively says this includes the right to destroy another’s body, for hedonistic,

egoistic, pragmatic, and/or utilitarian reasons, we unhesitantly damn such thinkingll (Also the classic over-
generalizations of the incest/rape argument forgets that apes are rare, and that resulting pregnancies are ex-
tremely rare (Willkes’ Handbook on Abortion),that there are varying degrees of consent in rape, and it’s almost

impossible to prove incest. Besides, laws are for the general case and not for exceptions, and such arguments use

an “either or h'ypotliesis"'i'n which an arbitrarily finite number of alternatives exist. And what's wrong with
altruism. Now, to focus in on the real issue.)

In Abortion: the Myths, the Realities. and the Arguments, Germain G. Grisez dismisses ethical relativism,
subjectivism, and or relativism, because: if all standards of right and wrong are relative, then no objective basis
for moral judgment can exist. Ethical criticism becomes impossible, making our existence a morally directionless
universe. In essences, the New Morality can be said only to be different from the old, and not necessarily better.
Utilitarianism fails in that it treats people as objects with other goods of diverse natures. Diverse goods (say a trip
to Europe over a human life) are incalculable because of diverse natures. (Moreover, in Grisez’s paper “Methods
of Ethical Inquiry" he says that in utilitarianism the ends must be very limited or indefinite; it is arbitrary in the

estimation of the benefits and in who the recipients will be; no real guidance for actual cases is given; it promotes

_enthusiasm for superficial change, but stifles more profound dynamism; it is unable to account for certain facts of

moral experience.) (In situation ethics it is a mistake to look to the situation for the act’s meaning. The interest
revolving about our choice delimits factors initially considered, which are potentially infinite, and we could extend
our reflection to enlarge and to transform the situation, which might be counterproductive to egoistic interests.
That a situation is ever ready-made is a psychological function.)

Iiis reformulation of the issue is that, the characteristics chosen by abortionists, to make inferior the unborn
child in personhood and rights, are arbitrary in their selection of certain preferential qualities or goods by which
they feel the acceptability of humanity should be judged. That an abortionist is greater in dignity because of
development is a subjective choice of arbitrary criteria. To disprove the personhood (not to be equated with
humanity) of the unborn child requires a metaphysical and not empirical postulate, and Grisez thinks this cannot
be satifactorily done. A ‘

Grisez states that ethics is concerned with one’s willingness to do something, and not with one's lack of
knowledge about consequences. “To be willing to kill what for all we may know could be a person is to be willing to
kill as it it is a person." says Girse, who may be forgiven for using it for analytic clarity. Ergo, abor-
tionists are like the hunter who takes a chance, shoots at what looks like a dear, and kills another hunter.For a
more rigorous into lines of thinking like this, try: Beyond the New Morality: The Responsibilities of Freedom, by
Germain G. Grisez and Russell Shaw (Univ. of Notre Dame Press, 1974) ; For an Ontology of Morals: A Critique of
Contemporary Ethical Theory. by Henry B. Veatch (Northwestern U. PL, 1971) ; also, look into Jacques Maritain,
Bernard Lonergan, Etienne Gilson, James Collins and Josef Peipir who take Veatch's work towards somethin

like a form of Aristotelian-Thomistic theistic existentialism.

Finally for those who wiould wish to use the Index Medicus at the Faulk Medical Libraryito research out data
on short-term postabortal complications, some leads are given concerning Christopher Tietze, M.D., who is a top
pro—abortionist and whose word can be trusted. His articles are_: “Early Medical Complications of Legal Abortion"
(June, 1972, Vol 3, No. 6) and “A Preliminary Report” (July, 1971, Vol 2, No. 7) in Studies in Family Planning;
“Legal Abortions: Early Medical Complications” (Vol 3 No. 4 Oct., 1971) in Family Planning Perspectives, Those
who may interested in us, as far as a philosophic orientation on life goes, can contact us at Box 817, Schenley Hall.

Both Marc Hiller and Christina Adachi are publicially challenged to debate. If they have not the stamina, let
them for eternity and a day remain silent.

One-time kid preacher and faith
healer Marjoe “A Modern Mira-
cle” Gortner jumps and struts
across the screen in a sweating,
ﬁnger-jabbing, ﬂap-winged evan-
gelical style that he says he
mimicked from Mick Jagger. He’s
on the revival-meeting glory road

I through America's Bible Belt and

he’s singing one of the old-time
songs: I ‘‘I feel so much

 better/since I laid my burden

down...O Thank You Je-e-sus/O

for layin’ by burden down...

Marjoe--his name is a fusion of
Mary and Joseph--laid down his
burden and quit the tent show
circuit with the release of his

  

documentary expose Marjoe in
1972, throwing over the hallelujah
trail for the college lecture trip and
Hollywood. He led a double life as
an evangelist he says, and gave it
up when the strain became too
much. ’

“l was going in and out of the
two lives and I decided I just don’t
want to do that anymore," Marjoe
says in the film. “I'd been playing
with that decision for a couple of
years and I was at a point where I
either have to do it (evangelism)
the whole way, do it good, or get
out.

“I thought about saying screw it,
I’m going ‘back and I'm going to do
the best I can, but ljust couldn't do’

that."

A fourth generation evangelist,
Marjoe joined the preacher’s
circuit at 3‘/2, claiming he was
called to preach, like Daniel, from a
dream. At four, he married a
California couple, sparking a legal
hassle resulting in that state’s
setting a minimum age of 21 for
marriage-performing ministers.
By that age he was already
traveling through Bible Belt
whistlestop towns with his preach-
ing parents, Vernon and Sister
Marge.

“My daddy and I would come
into a town and we'd go to see the

By the time he was six, he had
memorized 14 sermons--enough for
two weeks in one town. Sister
Marge sat behind him at the
podium, feeding him cue lines
during the sermon. Hallelujah
meant hurry up, you’re dragging;
Glory meant slow down, you’re

3 plus, thei/ll/Iarshall Tucker Band  

‘Joe Walsh Adds Up to Rock

BY DOUGLAS E. GEBHARD.

Despite the blaring of the PA
and the feedback connected with
bad sound arrangements, the band
played on. Trying to take the
crowd’s hoots and hollers, the
Marshall Tucker Band stuck to its
set and did their music. You can't
write about concerts anymore
unless you mention the crowd.
They play such an important part in

‘ the scene. Steve Stills in a recent
“...nAight-club act. H

concert said:
That's where the performer used to
insult the audience. Now its the
other way around.” How true.
A Southern band is a family.

What’s good for the band is good
for the family. And, they love to
play, and play a lot. The group told
me that Capricorn sets up shows
year round. They don’t want to sit
around for four months after
touring. They want to work, and
they want to work hard.

Setting a pace with “Can't You
See" that had the crowd in their
clutches, the boys set down a little

1’ blues with a great tune featuring

steel guitar, “Too Stubborn A Man
To Change My Mind". These are
possibly their finest tunes.

really be judged by academics.
With an encore number of
“Everyday I Sing the Blues" which
started out like a scat tune turning
into a beautifully laid back
heart-crusher...that’s the blues.

This is a band which has been on
the road for a year and a half and in
my opinion hasn’t received the
deserved recognition. With the
these people have it’s
inevitable that true success is
around that invisible corner.

Intermission time, and I talked to
the band. Then it was Joe Walsh
time. and I listened.

First though, what would the rock
world be without roadies? A. little
pleasanter, sometimes. For
instance: who needs a roadie who
come onstage before the band is
about to play and yells, “We had
four hundred people make more
noise than this last night...I want
noise!!!” . Well, the audience
didn’t need that insult and with Joe
Walsh’s apology (“Don’t pay
attention to that guy...its’s good to
be here.") neither did the
musicians.

After that poor beginning the
finest sound of rock snuck into the
Mosque with cheers of louder...
1ouder...behind it--the sound per-
sonnel had corrected the pro-‘
blems...what is a warm-up band for

anyway?

Pleasing the crowd's anxious itch
for “Smoker" material he left that
in the dust to shake like a rocker
should and hit “Tend My Garden.”
You know how the James Gang
influenced the sixties with a real
rockin' atmosphere to their shows?
Well, Joe has been through a bit I
suppose and has slowed down to a
real ﬁne pleasin' music.

The intricacies of his simplicity

are what make the sound. That is:

the overall sound from the music is
built on a single thought...actually
a group of single thoughts, like
“Rocky Mountain Way”. There
are maybe four different chord
structures used, but the way it
comes out is a many sounding
interweaving structure.

The tunes he has been doing
match ‘that virtuoso title he wears. _
From “Cast Your Fate to the
Wind” to his two encores “Get
Back" and the truly fantastic
“Funk 49" Joe captured the fast
pace and slow moving free_ wheelin’
Colorado Mountains.

‘If a musical form can deﬁne a

- personality trait,--rock is Joe

Walsh..;Joe Walsh isn’t rock. It
seems to me that he can talk back
to that guitar of his and to this
musical era, but it can’t do doodley
squat back to him.

showing at Manor

BY M. C. PILECKI

Why is it that the movie-going
public calmly tolerate long lines,
exorbitant admission prices, soggy
popcorn and chewing gum under
the seats, -but when a high-quality
foreign ﬁlm has subtitles, they stay

away in droves? ' ‘
A quick look at current and past

’ lists of Academy Award nominees

for Best Foreign Film shows some
of the most unseen, unheralded

"ﬂicks, simply because the English-

translated dialogue is written

' under the frame while the actors‘

speak their original lines, a film is
automatically doomed to obscurity.

' — Sometimes such ﬁlms are dubbed,

meaning that the mouths don’t
match the words, the voices don’t
match the characters and much of
the original essence is lost. Even
when the dubbing is as expert as
that done for The Emigrants, there
was still the disconcerting scene of

having the Swedish characters‘

speak ﬂawless English to each
other and come out with gibberish

». ‘~._.. d  ,5...-. .

to an American innkeeper. It just
didn't make sense.

Well, one of this year's nominees

for Best Foreign Film has made its
bid to save itself from obscurity.
The dubbed version of the
Israeli-made I Love You Rosa did
not do so well at the .Manor
Theatre, so now an English
language version--a different
movie in other words--is being
substituted.

Well, if it encourages more people
to see this ﬁnely made, provocative
ﬂick, then so be it. I Love You Rosa
is an oddity these days for being
one of the few ﬂicks to create a
strong, yet very believable female
character, the title’_s Rosa.

The film is mostly a ﬂashback of
the aged Rosa, starting with the

‘time she was a childless widow at

20 in 1887 Jerusalem. As dictated

‘by Deuteronomy (the fifth book of

Moses outlining much of Jewish
law), she must marry her hus-
band’s brother in order to carry on
her husband's name. The catch,

though, is that brother Nessim is
only 11, but deeply “in love” with
Rosa.

At first the film seems like a
sympathetic treatment of the
Oedipal complex. After an
altercation with his older brother--
whose wife calls him, among the
kinder things, another mouth to
feed--Nessim -leaves home and

. comes to live with Rosa, developing

a mother-child relationship. Still,
he desires her, and the neighbor-
hood gossips lightly assume that
they are sleeping together, and the
beautiful and virtuous Rosa is not
highly thought of. '
But the film goes deeper than a
simple love story. Thereis Rosa, a
strong-willed woman working to
support herself and Nessim,
valuing freedom over love. " She
openly resents the law that binds
her to marry Nessim, and protests
the factthat she cannot be,freed
until Nessim comes of age and
makes the choice not to marry.‘ She
is very much her own woman, and
wants no one dictating her life.
One of the best scenes is when
Nessim, proud that for the ﬁrst

time he has been paid from his
trade, staunchly proclaims his
manhood by ﬂinging the money at
Rosa and demanding “Food,
woman.” In an exchange that
would do justice to Gloria Steinem,
Rosa tells him her opinion of that
kind of manhood, and he leaves the
house to grow up. ____~
Naturally he returns as a man,
now ready and able to take Rosa as
his bride. But still she wants her
freedom, demanding that she must
be free to choose who she wants.
He reluctantly consents, knowing
that if he forsakes her he will never
be able to marry her. But when the
time , comes for the ceremony

_releasing Nessim from the law

(since, according to the law, the

.woman can have no say in the

matter), Rosa cannot spit in his
face, and does not go through with
it. , Of course things end somewhat
happily, with Rosa doing the
marriage ._proposal honors in an
eloquent speech explaining her
need for freedom. _
Sormaybe some of the action is
predictable, although astonishing
when one realizes the power of the

Law at that time. Rosa is quite a
rebel in her day, not only in her
own conﬂict but also when she
defies the townspeople and
rescues an adulteress from execu-
tion by stoning. The Orthodox
Laws have not held women in high
esteem, and to see an admirable
female character making her own
way despite the laws is quite
absorbing.

Naturally the film is very ethnic,
dealing as it is with Jewish law as a
central issue, and the film includes
customs and attitudes in general
that may ‘not be easily understood
by the general public. In this, one
is reminded of a Hitchcock film‘; I
Confess, concerning a Catholic
priest accused of murder, who
won’t save himself by revealing the
true killer admitted his deed in the
sacred confidence of confession.
Non-Catholics could not under-
stand the priest's quandary, much
as non-Jews may not understand
why Rosa is bound by the law.

So the film requires some
understanding of the laws and
customs behind the story.

“Love You Roso"nof limited to the Jewishfeminisf



. J



BY ADRIAN MCCOY

With the scarcity of good original _

plays around, many companies are
turning to the old, dependable
works, which by the sheer weight
of their greatness insure a
successful production. But the
Contemporary Laboratory Theatre
production of The Crucible is not
just another revival of Arthur
Miller’s work. It preserves‘ the
emotional impact and the lessons of
the original text.-

I The Crucible is the story of the

tragic witch hunts in Salemin 1692,
when twenty people were executed
for the practice of witchcraft. .

Kings Court feature

The characters of Miller’s play are
afraid of the dark side of human
nature. The only way they can face
any mystery is to blame it on the
devil. Any phenomenon they
cannot understand is attributed to
supernatural causes.

Naturally, when some young girls
are found dancing in the woods, the
incident is blamed on the devil’s
agents on earth, or more accu-
rately, on Tituba, a black servant.
The church is shown as a political
instrument which provokes and
‘plays upon mass hysteria, -making
it easier to see how, - this
embarrassing episode in America’s
‘history came about. '

The production centers itself
around this image of the world-
gone-mad, and the hysterical tone
is present in every line. There are
times when this is perhaps

overdone. Some of the speeches,‘

when low on emotional content,
come off as merely loud.

But on the. whole there is a fine
current of tension running through
.the performance. The accusers
ﬂing charges on all sides with
pernicious zeal, while the accused
are. either driven mad enough to
confess or defend themselves with
apathetic dignity.

There is undoubtedly evil loose in

  Irony Dominates “The LastlDetail", .

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

The Last Detail‘ is an irony

dominated ﬁlm concerning male "

friendship.

On the surface, the picture is
about two sailors, “Badass”:(Jack
Nicholson) and “Mule” (Otis
Young), who are assigned to escort
an 18 year old recruit, Meadows
(Randy Quaid), from the Norfolk
naval base to the brig at
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
Quaid was accused of stealing $40
from a polio contribution box on the
base.

The irony\starts when Quaid is

caught before he actually got the
money, resulting in a stiff
eight-years-in-the-brig sentence.
The polio contribution box was the
favorite charity of the commanding
ofﬁcer’s wife. V»

Instead of _the transfer from the
naval base to the brig being a
matter of strict discipline, the trek-
turns into one of the most

-fun-ﬁlled, initiating and memor-
able events of the adolescent’s

life--another ironic bit.

In the film, Nicholson serves as I

the corruptor. He introduces the
 to drinking gluttonously and

_ hassling - rednecks. i

when in -Washington, D.C., to
At a train.
station, he leads Quaid to fighting
several marines in the men’s room.
Finally, after convincing the kid to
get his first lay in a Boston
whorehouse, Nicholson loudly ex-
claims, “Welcome to the wonderful

~ world of pussy,” which symbolizes
the youth’s

last and ultimate
departure from adolescence to
adulthood.

More irony ﬂows. It appears that
Nicholson and Young, who repre-
sent enforcers of the military,

Salem, but its source is easily
found. Petty jealousies, greed and
repressed hostilities are let loose,
opening and irritating the festering
sore that is in Salem. The evil
comes from natural, not superna-
tural forces. The production leaves

. no doubt as to which is to blame.
. The beauty of Miller’s play is that

each of the characters reveal
themselves as they are. They show
their baseness and ignorance, their

A faith and dignity. A fine cast of

actors succeeds in bringing these
characters to life. Outstanding
performances aregiven by Eliza-
beth Austin as Abigail, the head of
the accusers’ party and Mary Alice
Bialock as the saint-like Rebecca
Nurse. Alan Clarey and Ken

' Costigan are good as the hypocri-

tical, materialistic Rev. Parris and
as Judge Danforth, who is
supposed to deal rationally with an
irrational situation.

Rock Preacher Marjoe

(Continued from Page 6)

into extra pockets sewn into his
suit, required by Sister Marge to
kiss all the ladies who gave over
$20.

Offscreen, Marjoe admits he
played it like a game. “I never
believed what I was saying. I
always knew it was just entertain-
ment. I knew that I could do it and
I was good at it, and I could make
money at it, but I knew my parents
had trained me to it. I saw it
always from the other side, the
show-biz side.” - .

And how did that exploitation of

" religion affect his faith?

“I’m a very religious man, I
believe in God--a lot of people don’t
believe me when I say that, they
think I’m the work of the devil,”
Marjoe says it fast, as though he
didn’t expect it to be believed
again. “But not in the church, not
that way. I've seen the wrong side
of it."

The film’s Marjoe calls the
evangelist circuit “Big-time Reli-
gion. You go into it as a business
and you run it like a business.”

_His own preaching took in $3

million from the time he was 4 until
he was 14 he claims, none of which
he saw or was held in trust for his
education.

Marjoe himself is a remarkably
rational man: “There is a little
guilt, but it purges itself," he says,
by means of his lectures and the
movie, his “personal statement.”

Neither were the churchgoers in
his movie exploited, he claims.
“All you see is what people do
naturally. It's the preachers and
people like me that kept them from
being natural.

“It’s preaching the guilt, the fire
and the brimstone that I’m down
on. I’m not down on Christianity--
if it works for you, hey that’s great,
I don’t want to take that away from
you. It’s the zealots, it’s the
Christians that would burn you in
hellfire that bother me.”

Did you ever believe any of those
people you claimed to heal were
actually cured? asks someone from
the audience.

“No suh. I believe Christ was a
good teacher, some of his lifestyle
was a good thing, but most of it was
mind over matter.” By Marjoe’s
estimate, 50-60% of the ailments
he cured were psychosomatic.

Marjoe makes no generalizations
about the future of religion in
America, but near the end of the
film he says, “Religion is a drug,
it’s addictive.” Then he stops a
minute and asks: “Can God
deliver a religion addict?”

really are the bad guys from a
moral viewpoint.“ Their behavior
during the transfer is most
unbecoming and unexemplary.
Quaid, who was the “criminal",
appears to be the good guy. He
was the type of person who'd obey
the Ten Commandments. At ﬁrst,
Quaid shunned the raunchy acti-
vities of the escorting officers
partly out of moral consideration
and partly out of naiveness.

On another level,_ the three
represent the id, the ego and
superego. Nicholson symbolizes
the id which follows the body urges
and instincts with no moral
barriers. It is Nicholson who first

gets drunk, argues and shouts

obscenities to a bartender, brawls
with marines, and looks for sexual
activity.

Young is the superego who tries to
suppress the urges of the id
(Nicholson). He constantly re-
minds Quaid that .Nicholson is
spending all their travelling
money. At one point, Young
accuses Nicholson of neglecting his
duty when they visit Quaid’s
mother on the way.

Finally, Quaid comes to be the ego

who acts as the balance or mediator
between the id and the superego.
Quite naturally, he follows the
urges of the id and has the time of
his life.

Quaid is an interesting character
to examine. His personality in
many ways parallels that of Tippie
Hedren from Hitchcock’s Marnie
Both were kleptomaniacs, came
from broken homes and appeared
lonely, depressed, friendless and
naive. Just as Sean Connery came
to understand the kleptomaniac
personality of Hedren, likewise
Nicholson understands Quaid in
The Last Detail.

I think Quaid stole to ' get
attention. It was an indirect way of
saying I need security and affection
as he had no friends until the
transfer and apparently didn’t get
attention and security from home.

His mother’s absence from home
when Quaid came to visit her
during the transfer symbolized a
mother who was never there when
needed by her child. An array of
wine and whiskey bottles scattered
chaotically about the living room
and the viewer knows her
personality.

Another piece of irony was that

KEN WAGONER
“Pitt’s Mr. D”

BY G.W. STEVENS

When the NCAA wrestling
tournament gets underway tomor-
row in Ames, Iowa, three members
of this year's Panther squad will
attempt to bring a title back to
Pittsburgh. Only nine Pitt
wrestlers have ever accomplished
this feat, the last one being Jim
Harrison who won the 167-pound
championship in 1963. Obviously,
NCAA titles are hard to come by,
but this tournament could turn out
to be one of the best ever for Pitt.

The three Panthers who will be
making the trip to Iowa State are
George Bryant (118), Rande

vStottlemyer (126), and Ron Sel-

fridge (142). It is quite possible
that one of these three wrestlers
could come away with the top
honors. Most of the attention will
be focused on Fuddy Bryant,
‘however, as he enters the
tournament as one of the favorites.

Bryant finished the regular
season with an 8-0 record which

included four consecutive pins in

the final ‘four matches of the
season. He continued his torrid

pace in the EIWA tournament .

[Easterns] pinning three of the four
men he faced, winning the
championship going away. For his
efforts, he was awarded this year's
Sheridan trophy which goes to the
tournament wrestler with the most
pins in the least amount of time.

Bryant's first pin came in his
opening match against Randy
Hamme of Temple at the 1:14
mark. He followed this up with a
fall over Cornell's Andy Little at
7:38. However, he ran into a bit of

_ trouble in the semi-finals when he

just squeezed out a 13-11 decision
over Lehigh’s Bob Sloand. He then
ﬁnished up the tournament in ﬁne
style with a pin of Dan Blakinger of

, Harvard with only two minutes and

22 seconds gone on the clock.
The 126-pound weight class will
probably be one of the most hotly
contested in the tournament. Pitt
will be entering one of the nation's '
best in this class as Freshman
Stottlemyer takes to the mats.
Rande is a two-time National-
Federation freestyle champion who

is no stranger to the tough NCAA .. .

     
     
       
   
     
    
    

BY RON SIEGEL
Sports Editor
The trip to Raleigh, N.C.-for the

NCAA Eastern Regionals is a

reward for the Pitt basketball team.
Nobody dreamed the Panthers

would come this far. and tomorrow

night's and Saturday's games are
just icing on the cake.

The 1973-74 edition of the Pitt
cagers has already won more
games [24] than any other Pitt
team, and it still has at least two
more games to go.

The team flew here early this
morning, and worked out today at
Reynolds Coliseum in preparation
for tomorrow night's 7:10 clash
with Furman.

The Paladins have also had their
best season in history (22-7), but
the odds-makers favor Pitt to go to
meet the winner of the North
Carolina State-Providence clash.

Furman made it to the Eastern
Regionals by overcoming a 12-point

 Bryant Tops Field At
 Nuti0nal Champiortship

competition. He ﬁnished third in
the Easterns, losing only to John
Fritz of Penn State, the eventual
126-pound champion and the
winner of the meet’s most
outstanding wrestler award.
Stottlemyer, coming off of a draw
with the defending champion in the
dual meet at Penn State, complete-
ly dominated the first two periods
of their second meeting at
Annapolis. He led by a 3-2 score
with only one minute remaining in
the match. However, Fritz came
alive and scored two quick
takedowns to cop a 6-4 victory.

RON SELFRIDGE
In Nationals

Selfridge has to get an award for
the most surprising wrestler in the
EIWA tournament. He entered the
meet with a record of 0-1 but

proceeded to upset second seeded '

Andy Campo of Army in the first
round 11-7. He next defeated
George Baker of Harvard, 9-6,‘
before dropping his semi-final
match to Scott Myers of Rutgers.
He was later awarded third place in
the 142-pound class be beating
Denis Underkoffler (Navy) 9-6.

It may be a different story for
Selfridge when he travels to Iowa
this week. The competition will be
much tougher and he could be held
back by‘ the lack of experience.
However, the Clearﬁeld, Pa. native
could be termed a “tournament
wrestler" and can't be ruled out as
an upset finisher.

deficit and upsetting South Caro-
lina Saturday, 75-67.

Speaking to the weekly basket-
ball writers by telephone hookup
yesterday, Paladin coach Joe
Williams said that the Gamecocks
may have become overconﬁdent
when they built up their lead.
“Besides," he added, “Our team
is used to hustling and scrapping
back in big games." '

The Panthers have been fed a
steady diet of zone defenses in the
closing weeks of the regular season
and in Saturday's 54-42 victory

over St. Joseph’s at Morgantown..

Furman will use a man-to-man
defense unless it gets into foul
trouble, according to Williams.

Billy Knight, who everybody is
expecting to pop out of his scoring
slump with a 30-point performance,
will probably be guarded by 6-9
Clyde Mayes, who shut off South
Carolina’s Brian Winters at crucial
times.

Throughout the season, oppo-
sing coaches have almost unan-
imously agreed that one man
cannot guard Knight, and “Moon-
ey’s" picture twisitng layups,
absent in recent weeks because of
zone defenses that concentrated on
him, may be quite evident on you
television tomorrow night.

Like many of the schools Pitt has
faced and conquered this year,
Furman is bigger and slower. The
Paladins front three consists of 7-1
Fessor Leonard, 6-9 Mayes, and
6-6 Craig Lynch.

Mayes is the leading Furman
scorer, averaging 17.4 points per
game, while Leonard has hit for
15.4 per tally.

Carolina to face Furman in the Eastern Regional semi-finals. photo by

Rich Taylor.

The player guest at the luncheon
was Pitt’s “defensive specialist"
Kenny Wagoner. The Beaver Falls
tri-captain led the jokes about his
lack of scoring.

“I tell myself before each game

that I’m going -to have a big»

shooting game sometime, but that
game hasn’t come yet.”

“You're running out of time,"
came a response from the head
table. “You might only have two
games left." .

Asked about the team's recent
shooting slump, Wagoner replied,
“Shooting’s a confidence and
rhythm thing, and I think the
team's got it down pat.
haven’t found it yet.”

Wagonerihas drawn numerous

charging fouls this season, a skill
he says he learned from former
Panther Bill Downs, who always

But I‘

pulled it off against “Wags” in his
freshman year.

“A lot of time players are just
looking at the basket, and I can
sneak in front of them," explained
Wagoner, who hasn’t received a
warning from an official for
“acting", which is a technical foul.

“We teach our boys to fall after
they've been hit," said assistant
coach Fran Webster. “They'd get
hurt if they tried 'to»stay up."

Wagoner also pointed out that he
was checking into the possibility of
getting some eligibility for next
season as an offensive player.

Actually, Kenny “D" is an
important part of the Pitt offense,
and the success of Wagoner and
the other Pitt guards at executing
fast breaks will be a big factor in
determining whether Pitt plays in a
consolation game or for the Eastern
Championship Saturday.

 State Still On Top

By The Associated Press--UCLA,
which wrapped up the Paciﬁc—8
conference title with an 82-52
triumph over Southern California

last week, leapfrogged over Notre ‘

Dame into second place behind
North Carolina State in the weekly
Associated Press college basketball
poll released today.

UCLA, the defending national
champion with a 23-3 record
through games of Saturday, will
meet 20th ranked Dayton in the
NCAA's West regional semiﬁnals
Thursday night.

Dayton, 20-7, replaced NCAA
Midwest host Oral Roberts in the
poll after handing Notre Dame its
second loss of the season, a 97-82
u,pset.__

North Carolina State, which will
seek to preserve its once-beaten
record--best of the ranked teams--
against No. 5 Providence in the
NCAA East semiﬁnals, received 24
first place votes and 792 points
from a panel of sports writers and
broadcasters.

UCLA, with three losses for the
season, received 17 first place
votes and 748 points while the Irish

amassed 652 points for third place.

Maryland remained fourth in the
poll despite its 103-100 loss to N.C.
State in the Atlantic Coast
Conference championship tourna-
ment Saturday night. The loss
ended the Terps" NCAA playoff
hopes and their season at 23-5
since. they declined a bid to the
National Invitation Tournament.

Providence, eighth a week ago,
improved its ranking with triumphs
over Brown and Penn and losses by
Vanderbilt, North Carolina and
Southern Cal. The three teams had
been fifth, sixth and seventh a
week ago.

Vanderbilt will take its No. 6
ranking against No. 8 Marquette in
the Mideast Regional semiﬁnals"
while seventh-ranked North Caro-
lina will face Purdue in the second
game of the NIT tournament. at
Madison Square Garden Saturday.

Through games of Saturday,
Vanderbilt is 23-3, Marquette 23-4
and North Carolina 22-5. -

Long Beach State, which already
completed its season at 23-2,
remained ninth, but Indiana, which
edged Purdue 80-79, moved up

from 13th to 10th. The Hoosiers’
hopes for an NCAA berth against
Notre Dame, however, were
doused Monday night when they
lost a Big Ten Conference playoff
against 12th-ranked Michigan 75-
67. The playoff between the
conference co-champions was
forced when Michigan beat Mich-
igan State Saturday.

In the second 10, are Alabama,
Michigan, Pittsburgh, Kansas,
Southern Cal, Louisville, New
Mexico, South Carolina, Creighton
and Dayton.

Pittsburgh meets Furman in the
NCAA East semiﬁnals; Kansas and

no such thing as an unknown
superstar. But stop and think. Do
you know who he is and what he
does? ’

For all of you unknowing people.
Rea is one ofthe best track athletes
in the history of Pitt athletics.
Since coming here as a freshman,
he has torn up all competition year
after year.

His excellence can be found in
the statistics. For example, he has
won eight Eastern Championships
[the latest just two weeks ago at
Princeton] which ties him with

jock-turned-commentator Marty

Liquori. Rea still has the outdoor
season ahead where he will
probably break the tie.

Four _times Rea has been
selected to the All-American team
in track and in 1972 missed the US
Olympic team by a ‘A of an inch.

As ajunior Rea was a member of '

the team who went to Russia in the
summer competing against I the
Russians and since 1971 has been
the outstanding collegiate athlete
according to Track and Field News.
Pretty good statistics for an
unknown. '
Talking to Rea, all the glory and
awards are left behind and what is
left is a very intelligent quiet dental

student who looks more like actor
David Hartman than a champion
long jumper.

“One of my main reasons for
coming to Pitt was the great
facilities here,” according to Rea.
“The indoor track was impressive.
Also, even though I came here on a
partial scholarship, I had a chance
for a full one which was needed.”
As you might have guessed, Rea
has been worth his scholarship.

Although having a great year
(Rea was first in the Eastern
Championships and second in the
Nationals). he believes his finest
year was 1972. I .

"In '72 I was really psyched for
the Olympic Trials‘. I would work
out every day in the morning and
afternoon. Since then my training
has been going down hill. I gave
away the Nationals this year. I
didn't even hit the end board on my
leap which would have given my
eight or nine more inches."

The Olympics are again on Rea's
mind as he looks to the future. I'm

‘looking forward to the '76 trials.

Even though I'll still be in Dental
School, I want to compete."
Probably the person who knows
the most about Rea is Head Track
Coach Jim Banner. “Billy Rea is a
first-rate competitor. , He has
tremendous desire to win and no
matter what he has done, he just

keeps doing better.”

“I think Billy has done more for
the name of Pitt than any other
athlete." Banner continued.
“He's gone all over the world to
compete and made the University a

known name."

Rea is a winner for a combination
of reasons according to Banner.
"Billy has great pride. the great
competitor spirit everyone needs
and the coolness to hang in when
the going gets rough."

“He is also a very unselfish
person,” Banner continued. “He
encourages the other men and
helps out where he can.”

Billy Rea may be an unknown
superstar but he shows the kind of
drive and determination all compe-
titors strive for.

 Wolfpack Favored OverProvidenc

X7‘?

RALEIGH, N.C. AP--Providence
Coach Dave Gavitt ﬁgures his team
will have to play “near-perfect
basketball‘ to defeat top-ranked
North Carolina State Thursday
night in the NCAA Eastern
Regionals in Raleigh.

Gavitt said NC State “is far and

away the best team" Providence
has faced.
Unranked Furman, 22-7, the

Southern Conference champion

and surprise winner over South
Carolina 75-67 Saturday night,

meets 13th-ranked Pittsburgh,

24-3, in the opener Thursday night
at 7:05 pm, EDT NC State plays
fifth-ranked Providence, 27-3, in
the second game. A
Although UCLA handed NC
State, 26-2, its only loss this
season, the Wolfpack is not looking
ahead to a possible second shot at
the Bruins in the NCAA ﬁnals.
“Our goal right now is to beat
Providence and win the Eastern
Regionals," said State Coach Norm
Sloan. The Wolfpack pulled out a
103-100 overtime victory over
Maryland Saturday night to win the
Atlantic Coast Conference tourna-
ment. ‘
Sloan said he hasn’t seen

Providence play this season, “but
l’ve talked with some who have and
they say they’re fast and have a
pressure defense. They have a
great basketball team.”

Marvin Barnes, Providence’s lea-
ding scorer with an average of 22.5
points per game, is no stranger to
Sloan and State stars David
Thompsonand Tommy Burleson.
Sloan was assistant coach of the
United States team on which
Barnes,Thompson and Burleson
played in the World University
Games last summer.

Barnes was asked recently just
how good Thompson really is. He
replied, “How good is good?
That's David Thompson.”

Burleson, State’s 7-foot-4 center,
played perhaps his greatest game
in the victory over Maryland,
scoring 38 points. Thompson
added 29 points.

Furman trailed South Carolina by
12 points before rallying-behind
Clyde Mayes to score its eighth
straight victory.

Pittsburgh will be favored to run
its recordto 25-3 against Furman.
The Panthers defeated St. Joseph’s
Pa. 54-42 Saturday to move into the
Eastern Regionals.

Freshman diver Bert Snoznik
hopes to keep her winning ways for
the three—day meet at Penn State.
She placed eighth on the one-meter
board and tenth place three-meter

Jeff Miller is confident Snoznik will
put in a fine performance on both
boards for Pitt.

Head coach Virginia Grindle is
hopeful of a good showing by the
Piranhas. “I’m confident that girls

already proven their ability to
handle the pressure of a big meet.
