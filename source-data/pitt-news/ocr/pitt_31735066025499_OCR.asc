Outgoing Student
Government Board member
Christa Douaihy broke into tears
last night in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom as she expressed
her gratitude. to outgoing presi-
dent Justin DalMolin, referring to
him as a "natural leader."

"You are our knight in shin-
ing armor and will always be our
president," Douaihy said.

Moments earlier, DalMolin
swore in Alyson Wallach as his
replacement on the SGB.

The inauguration ceremony
was held to usher in new SGB
members, including: Elizabeth
Klein, Byron Woodson, Kelly
Myers, Mark Murphy, Jennifer
Karch, Damon Hudac, Michael
Friedberg and Adam Tenkel, as
well as a time to reﬂect on the
past year for the old board's
tenure.

"I decided a year ago today
not to be the position [SGB pres-
ident]," DalMolin said. "but to

‘ make the position."

He added that the new SGB
will have trouble measuring up to
the outgoing one but said that if
the members stay dedicated to
their jobs, they can do it.

In his outgoing speech,
DalMolin advised the new SGB
to "face their fears and rise to the
challenge." Then, he said, they
will be able to look back at what

Items from Chick-frl-A,

gourmet burgers and grab-and— .

go sub sandwiches are now
available in the basement of the
Cathedral, and unlike the Roy
Rogers that was there for 12
years, the new Cathedral Cafe
accepts Dining Dollars.

"When reviewing bids [for
a new meal provider on campus
last year], we were really anx-
ious for students to use the space
here," said Betsy Sallade-
Farina, Pitt's director of food
services, while showing olf the
University's newest eatery early
this week "Sodexho [the new
meal provider] was the only one
who agreed to let students use
Dining Dollars in the space."

The pit stop for hungry stu-
dents on the go opened during
ﬁnals week in December but is
new to most students this
semester.

And through the ﬁrst few

days since coming back to Pitt,
students seem to enjoy using
their meal plans in the
Cathedral. In a typical day, the
Cathedral Cafe serves nearly
2,000 customers, raking in
approximately $8,700, accord-
ing to Cathedral Cafe Account
Manager Jody Ludovici.

“Business is twice that
[what it was at Roy Rogers],”
said Sallade—Farina. “The vol-
ume is much better. That’s not
because Roy Rogers was a bad
restaurant, but it was here 12
years, and people got tired of it.”

Sophomore Tony Funari is
one of those people who is
happy with a new place to eat in
Pitt’s famous landmark.

“It’s a lot more convenient
[than Roy Rogers],” said
Funari, “because they now take
Dining Dollars.”

In addition to the students’
ability to use their meal plans at
the location, a few more
changes were made.

Officers’ fates remain uncertain
Ramesh Reddy

Staff Writer

The fate of two white police officers charged with
the involuntary manslaughter of black motorist Jonny
Garnrnage remains unclear nearly a month after a second
trial ended in a mistrial.

While much of Pittsburgh was sitting waiting for the
Steelers-Patriots‘ regular-season game to begin on Dec. 3,
12 jurors sat in a room in the county courthouse deliber-
ating a case that has heightened racial tensions in the city
for nearly two years.

Former Brentvvood Lt. Milton Mulholland and
Baldwin Patrolman Michael Albert were on trial for the
"reckless restraint" that prosecutors say led to the death of
Gammage in October 1995.

Eleven jurors wanted to acquit the defendants, but
one juror, Pitt custodian Walter Mooreﬁeld, says he want-
ed to convict them.

After six votes, the deadlocked jury appealed to
Judge James E. Rowley who declared a mistrial.

The prosecution, defense attorneys, spectators and
journalists in attendance said they were shocked by the
ruling, which came only one day after deliberations
began.

When Rowley announced his decision, tears welled

“It’s even more convenient than
having your own computer,” said
Mike Spring of Pitt's Department of
Information Sciences.

This feature, called “remote file
space,” will eliminate the need for
students to carry around floppy disks.
Under the feature, students will be
able to save information onto one
computer and retrieve the informa-
tion at any time on any other comput—
er on campus.

“I think it’s the most exciting part
for students,” said Spring.

Though the remote file space is
still in the beginning stages,
Windows NT 4.0, the new system
that allows this feature to be incorpo-
rated in the future, has already been
installed in 80 University computers;
40 in the ground floor of the
Cathedral and 40 in the Forbes Quad
lab.

Through Windows NT 4.0, which
will be available in all University
IBM computers by August, students
have access to the newest Microsoft
programs available, such as Word 97,
Excel 97 and Internet Explorer.

the system,” said Robin Rueﬂe, pro-

ject leader for the migration.
Though the system is easier to
use and more updated, Pitt’s comput-

er services are still working out

minor problems, but, according to

Ruefle, students have handled the,

new addition with ease.

“We’ve been watching people use vi
the computers, and so far, they’ve k
been coming in and sitting down and h

working away,” said Rueﬂe._
Rueﬂe said there are some differ-

ences from the old Windows 3.11 that ‘

all, logging in requires the student to 

press the ctrl+alt+delete keys before
typing in their name and password.

RESTAURANT

For starters, Roy Rogers’ roast beef
sandwiches and french fries are gone. In
its place, Chick—ﬁl-A serves chicken sand-
wiches, chicken nuggets, waffle fries and
four other items.

Also, Sodexho operates a salad and
cold-sandwich shop which offers two or
three different salads and three or four dif-
ferent sandwiches each
day. Next to that is a
gourmet-burger stand
which serves eight—ounce
hamburgers, six—ounce
turkey burgers and vege-
tarian black-bean burgers
— each for $3.95.

“That’s not a bad
price for a gourmet burg-
er grilled right in front of
you,” commented
Sallade-Farina about the
price.

In addition, the
Cathedral Cafe serves
chili and soup each day
and has a self-serve cold-
case with drinks, fruit, salads, pudding
cups and hoagies.

‘They have a nice variety of stuff,”
said junior Tom Reynolds. “I could eat
here pretty often and not get too bored
with the selection.”

And the variety can only get better,
according to Sallade-Farina and Ludovici.

The two explained that the spaces
where cold sandwiches and gourmet

burgers are being served are capable of
changing easily, in order to serve other
items.

For example, the grills and stoves in
these areas could be used to cook fried
ﬁsh if student requests show that ﬁsh
would be popular.

“We could have fried ﬁsh, different
broiled sandwiches, or
the entree—type items like
at Schenley Cafe,” said
Sallade-Farina.

One change that won’t
be made, however, is the
implementation of
blocks as a payment
method. According to
Sallade—Farina,
Cathedral Cafe would be
ﬂooded with students
and lose many of its cash
sales if blocks could be
used there. By allowing
Dining Dollars and not
blocks as payment, the
amount of students is
“limited," but still larger than at the Roy
Rogers.

As 1,800 people make their way to
the Cafe each day —— including much of
the student body with meal plans —— the
staff is still getting used to what sells well
and what might be changed.

“It’s still too new to get much student
reaction,” said Sallade—Farina, “but we’re

real excited about it so far.”

University; lobbying for more access to stu-
dent aid; and instilling more Pitt pride.

But she said the ﬁrst order of business
for the new SGB will be its retreat this com-
ing weekend. There, the new members will
bond and start to work together.

Wallach said the retreat was planned by
the SGB advisors and she and the board did-
n't know where it would be held.

She did say, however, that most of the

p retreat will be spent on campus.

"We won't be wasting any money.
We're doing virtually the same thing they
did last year."

Wallach said the SGB will dedicate the
Saturday of the retreat to setting goals and
prioritizing them. Then by Sunday, they will
know what the ﬁrst order of business will
be.

The new SGB takes over after a scan-
dal-ridden semester in which DalMo1in
spent unnecessary amounts of money on
luxury cars and four-star hotels while on
SGB business.

In addition, Gerald Klayrnan — former
chair of the Allocations Committee, which is
responsible for distributing funding to stu-
dent groups —— faces charges along with ﬁve
other people for allegedly rnisappropriating
funds for their own gain.

As a result, new guidelines will be in
place to ensure that these things carmot hap-
pen again.

Among the guidelines, organizations
that receive funding for trips or guest speak-
ers must prove they actually attended the

event and that guest speakers are really
experts in their ﬁelds.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said the
new guidelines will act as a checks-and-bal-
ance system for the allocations process.

"The lesson of the past year is that
everybody can be a little more careful how
they do things," he said.

Wallach said she thinks _the new alloca-
tions rules are an improvement, and added
that while the reasons behind the new rules

are unforttmate, the new allocations manual

is much clearer and easier to read.

DalMolin stressed that the allocations
process was not at fault, just the people who
were involved.

"It's good that they learned their lesson
while in college, where their face will only
appear on the front of The Pitt News," he
said, "instead of out in the real world where
it may appear on the cover of the USA
Today."

Da1Mo1in said he isn't worried about
being thought of as the scandalous presi-
dent. Rather, he feels the board’s accom-
plishments speak for themselves and will be
remembered.

Nordenberg said that one of the dimen-
sions of leadership is a higher level of scruti-
ny than most people are accustomed to.

But as for the new SGB, he "expects the
best."

In her inauguration speech Wallach
mirrored that sentiment.

"Let me assure you," she said. "We will
accomplish our goals."

MISTRIAL

in the eyes of Mulholland, who is now retired.

"He was devastated. He's had it," said
Mulho1land's attorney, Patrick Thomassey.
"[Mulhol1and] has had his name associated
with racist remarks for 26 months."

Thomassey said he was shocked and dis-
appointed at the outcome.

"We were surprised at the mistrial as any-
body. We didn't know it was coming," he said.

Mulholland and Albert have refused to
comment to the press, even though their attor-
neys asked the judge to lift the gag order that
prevented them from commenting on the case.

Their attorneys argued that they need to be
able to defend themselves after receiving so
much public scrutiny.

Pete Shell, of the Campus Coalition for
Peace and Justice, was perplexed after hearing
the outcome of the case. The CCPJ has been
active in organizing protests over the Garnrnage
case.

"I couldn't even believe it. It just shows me
how lackadaisical the prosecution was. I think
anybody in our group could have presented a
better case than the prosecutor did," said Shell.

Shell said he was not sure whether the
cause of the deadlock was race related. The jury
was composed of 11 whites and one black -
Mooreﬁeld.

"There was one black man on the jury so I
wouldn't be surprised if it was [the reason].
That's why it's really important that we have an

integrated jury. This jury should have consisted '

of more black and minority people," said Shell.

Speculation that Mooreﬁeld was the hold-
out juror turned out to be true. Mooreﬁeld
declined comment to this newspaper because
he said he now fears negative repercussions
because of his actions.

After the trial he admitted to KDKA News
that he was the lone juror who wanted to con-
vict the oﬂicers.

"If 11 people are trying to get me to change
my mind, how do I try to get one of them to

FROM PAGE 1

change theirs?" he said in the interview. "I said
I don't care. If it's a day, if it's a month  I don't
care if it's doomsday."

Legal experts said it is unusual for one
juror to withstand the pressure of the other 11 in
cases of this magnitude.

"There is tremendous pressure, conformity
pressure on the minority. It's rare a single person
can stand up to that," said Dr. Martin
Greenberg, a Pitt psychology professor who
specializes in law and psychology.

Thomassey was upset by the mistrial ruling
saying he wants the ordeal to be over for the
defendants and their families.

The officers’ ﬁrst trial for the ofﬁcers ended
in a mistrial when Allegheny County Coroner
Cyril Wecht testiﬁed that the defendants should
explain what they had done wrong.

Thomassey said the case should not be
tried in the criminal courts.

"It was one person holding out This case is
not a criminal case. Why are we putting their
families through this over and over and over?
We are hoping the new D.A. who comes in will
toss it out," he said.

New District Attorney Stephen Zappala, Jr.
will decide whether there will be a third trial.
He has not yet made his decision.

The defense said it is not ready to give in
easily to the judge's ruling.

"We asked the [judge] to consider a motion
of judgment of acquittal. The judge has the
power to do that so we don't have to go back to
trial," said Thomassey.

The ruling on that motion has not yet been
made. I

"We need ﬁnality to this. It's going on and
on and on up to the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court back down, trial, pre-trial.  We are try-
ing to do everything we can to get things done
and we can't seem to get it done," said
Thomassey.

Brentwood oﬁicer John Vojtas was acquit-
ted last year in the death of Garnrnage.

Denny's manager perpetuates image of company’: racism

Across the Nation

 

MIAMI -— The Denny's restaurant
chain faces new discrimination com-
plaints. A group of corrections ofﬁcers
claim they were turned away twice
from a Denny's in South Florida. Six of
the officers in the group are black.

One of the ofﬁcers tells The Miami
Herald that the restaurant manager told
them the place had run out of food and
also said, "You guys don't look right
together." The officers complained to
the company's headquarters.

A company spokesperson says
Denny's is committed to diversity.

Denny's is already working under a
civil-rights monitor because of a 1994
discrimination case. That case
stemmed from an incident at a
Maryland Denny's involving black
Secret Service agents assigned to
President Clinton.

WASHINGTON — Despite talk of out-
lawing human cloning, a Chicago scien-
tist says he plans to try it. Richard Seed
told National Public Radio that he plans
to set up a cloning clinic.

He says he'll use the same. tech-
niques utilized by Scottish scientists in
1996 to clone the sheep, Dolly, the first
cloned mammal.

Seed says he has assembled a group
of physicians and four couples who
have volunteered to be cloned.

Seed tells The Washington Post that
he'll take his facility overseas if the gov-
ernment prevents him from cloning a
human in the United States.

In the wake of Dolly's cloning, a
national bioethics panel last year recom-
mended that Congress pass a law mak-
ing human cloning illegal. The panel
said the technique poses unacceptable
risks of mutations and raises troubling
ethical questions.

Around the World

CAPE TOWN, South Africa — A for-
mer president of white-ruled South
Africa will be prosecuted for defying a
panel set up to investigate abuses com-
mitted under apartheid.

The attorney general today says
he'll bring P.W. Botha to trial for ignor-
ing repeated subpoenas to appear before
the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission.

If convicted, Botha could face
prison time and a ﬁne.

Botha has called the commission a
"circus" and a witch hunt against
apartheid-era leaders.

The decision followed a warning
from current South African President
Nelson Mandela that no one should be
above the law. It also came after the
panel's head, Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, formally requested that Botha face

 

charges for refusing to meet with the
commission.

TOKYO —— A high school runner, a for-
mer ski jumper and a television person-
ality kicked it off. They started carrying
the Olympic ﬂame yesterday from the
comers of Japan to Nagano.

But with just one month to go
before the winter games, Nagano's ﬁck-
le weather presents far more concern
than does the path of 1,200 runners who
will carry the ﬂame through all parts of
Japan.

Forecasters say the El Nino warm-
ing pattern could mean less snow on
venues at low altitudes. Organizers have
set up elaborate weather-monitoring
arrangements.

_ A bit of snow did fall on the Nagano
area yesterday — covering all sites of
the games in a white blanket for the ﬁrst
time this winter.

One more day of vacation would be‘ nice

Dan Ertman

Who's going to take
care of the mutants?

Little Bobby-75Hl can’t feed himself. He has four legs
but no arms.

Little Jenny—01X3 needs all her food run through a
blender on puree. She was born without a tongue.

Big Pat-7F4, on the other hand, has just the right number
of arms and legs, and a tongue that works just ﬁne. Other
than being six feet tall and 200 pounds, and just a little bit
retarded, he seems very nomral for a 4-year-old.

Are these the front—page stories of a supermarket
tabloid? .
No. They’re the failed experiments of fertility doctors
who tried to clone humans.

Well, they could be, not too long from now.

A scientist in Chicago announced yesterday that he will
attempt to clone human beings. He said he has assembled 90
percent of the project already and has four couples lined up
who have agreed to be cloned. '

Some call him crazy, including the London scientist who
was responsible for the world’s ﬁrst test-tube baby. He said
the Chicago scientist is “not to be taken seriously,” and he
believes that cloning technology is not yet advanced enough
to be successful with humans. V

So what happens if this scientist really attempts to clone
humans and it doesn’t work?

Probably the same things that happened to the sheep
clones that were produced before Dolly. .

The difference is, when you’ve produced a mutant sheep
with an ear growing out of its back, the words “put it to
sleep” have a rather humane ring to them. _

But we don’t put humans to sleep, at least, not infants.

Couples who seek fertility treatments typically expect a
child that at least resembles human form, but couples who
want to be “cloned” are looking for something that looks
exactly like one of them, not an amorphous blob of living tis-
sue.

What then do they do with Bobby-75Hl, who is des-
tined to walk on all fours for the rest of his life?

Can we call him nonhuman to make “putting to sleep”
easier? What about Jenny-OIX3, who just doesn’t have a
tongue? Where do we draw the line?

Questions like these have prompted most fertility doc-
tors to call a for moratorium on human cloning research.
Most doctors.

One is willing to try it, possibly paving the way for oth-
ers.

Don’t take him seriously? Or can we really afford not to?
He doesn’t have the technology to be successful?
Actually, it’s not a success that we should worry about.

Columnist

There’s a line in ‘‘All Quiet
on the Western Front” that reads
something close to, “You grow to
dread leave time. It only makes it
harder to go back again.” On
Monday, most of the students
here found out just how true that
really is.

Some students wandered
around campus in a state of tired
bewilderment, marveling that
their professors had enough ener-
gy to teach. Of course, some of
the professors didn’t_ have
enough energy to teach, and left 21
notes on the classroom doors that
said “Class canceled. Needed
sleep.” '

Other students just stayed in
their rooms, which, given the
amount of material most of the
professors successfully plowed
through, may not have been such
a bad idea. Some didn’t even
make it back, their planes having
been delayed due to snow, fog,
cold, wind, alligator infestation
or mechanical failure.

I, unfortunately, was almost
one of the latter. My plane was
scheduled to take off at 4:55 p.m.
but didn’t leave the ground until
8:20 p.m. I got to Pittsburgh
around 10:25, and actually
arrived on campus at about 11:15
that Sunday night.

I don’t remember Monday
all that well due to a lack of
sleep, because of my decision to
unpack after arriving, and thanks
to the fact that my normal wake-
up time during the break was
noon. If you had softly sneaked
up behind me and shoved an ice

pick between my shoulder blades
during my 9 a.m. math class, I
probably wouldn’t have noticed
until 11 or so, at which point my
response would have been some-
thing like, “Hmm  Something
kind of hurts in my back. I won-
der what it could be. Oh well.’’

Because of
these streams of
walking zom-
bies, of which I
most certainly
was one, I
would like to
take this oppor-
tunity to beg the
University ‘ to
please, please
extend the
semester break
by at least one
day next year. I
believe that one extra day of
break would cure at least a few of
these ills, or at least assuage
them, and would therefore be
more beneﬁcial than one day of
having students somnambulate
(look it up) to their classes, plop
down in their chairs, take a nap,
awaken one hour later and repeat
the routine.

I can hear the cries of the
people in charge of scheduling
now. “What a pathetic idiotl!
What kind of buffoons does this
moron take us for? Adding an
extra day won’t change anything!
It will just postpone the
inevitable!! The students will just
stay home one more day!”

To this I respond: Do what
you always do in the summer-
time! Schedule some kind of ori-
entation program on Monday,
around 1 p.m. or so, and tell stu-

dents if they aren’t there, they’re
going to be sorry later. Then do
nothing except talk about
“Improving Campus Life” or
something for an hour. That way,
most students will be back on
campus, sleeping, with some of
their books purchased, instead of
at home, party-
ing, without the
faintest recall
of what classes
they scheduled
t h e m s e l V e s
into.

“ G o d
what a fool!!”
the scheduling
people are cry-

ing. “That
won’t work
either! ! None

of the students
Wlll fall for that trick! No one
will be here! Never in all of our
time have we heard such point-
less begging for an extra day!”

Well, then why not do it this
way: Schedule classes to start
Monday, and then cancel them.
Tell the professors of your plan
ahead of time so they won’t be
upset.

“Hmrnrn, that might work,
but then the students will be real-
ly pissed with us, and we’ve got
them upset enough as it is.”

No, they probably won’t get
too pissed with you because most
of them will be too tired to
notice.

Trust me. I would have been.

about doubled how much sleep

Making promises we don '1‘ even want to kee

James Maude
Columnist

The 1997 calendar lies in the
trash can, or if you adopted the popu-
lar New Year’s resolution to be
kinder to our planet, it lies in a neat,
tied—up bundle with newspapers wait-
ing to be picked up by the recycling
people. A new 1998 calendar, with
January opened up and looking
cheerily on at the next 365 days
ahead, is suspended on the wall in its
place.

Many people view the change in
years as merely a numerical addition,
while some take time to reﬂect on the
31st of December on what they did
wrong over the past year and figure
out how the next year can be used to
remedy these things and make sure
they never happen again. How many
of us make it past Jan. 10 without
breaking any of our resolutions? Not
many.

My New Year’s resolution is a
challenging one: I plan to be as inof-
fensive as possible in my columns,
and I plan to write with intelligence,
a subtle wit and an air of sophistica-
tion. Failing that, I shall try to rip off
columns I read in the New Yorker and
The Economist. I must come to real-
ize that, for example, while certain
students in the College of Business
Administration are complete cretins,
I should try not to offend them.

But do people realize how shal-
low it is to come up with a list of res-
olutions on New Year’s Day in front
of their loved ones or friends or
drunken lunatics and have absolutely
no intention of keeping them? Well, I
shall try, but human nature will
ensure that I fail. But according to
some guy whose name escapes me,
“Determination is two-fifths of the
law, with hollow vessels making the
most sound and too many cooks
spoiling the broth.”

Hmm. I resolve to do more
research before diving into an opin-
ions column.

Many people also confuse New
Year’s resolutions with total person-
ality overrides. A friend of mine, a
rather libidinous fellow, vowed two
years ago that women were the rea-
son why “mankind” was not already
an intergalactic species. Three weeks
later, Richard was going on bar
crawls in a billy-goat mood shouting
“Hmmmhmmm, I want me some of
that!” at every woman he came
across.

With some people, the resolutions
they make sound as realistic to them
as Louis Farrakhan shouting from the
rooftops that he vows to become a
white man.

Does the end of a particular year
mean the death of a lifestyle? Does
Joe Pitt, currently languishing acade-
mically and on probation, give up his
lifestyle of alcohol and partying? He
may drink a whiskey drink, he may
drink a vodka drink, he may drink a
lager drink, he may drink a cider

drink. He may sing a song which-

reminds him of the good times, he
may sing a song which reminds him
of the best times, but will that be a
responsible action? Give up the par-
tying for the studying, or vice versa?

Well I’m not going to make
impossible—to—keep resolutions.
Rather I’m going to think about this
and redefine my parameters. Should I
be so brash and forward in my
columns? Should I even carry on

writing for The Pitt News? Well, I’m
not for monastic columns, and since
I’ve got nothing better to do than
hang around the news office and
harass other reporters, I have to come
up with a compromise.

New Year’s Day has already

A passed, and I know many people have

come up with resolutions whilst in a
drunken stupor. You can bet they will
not have an effective follow—through.
Their plans went down the toilet at
more or less the same moment as
their vomit the day after.

So that you can keep a check on
me, and see if I keep them or not,
here’s a list of my other New Year’s
resolutions:

0 Throw bricks at pretentious theater
arts majors or anyone who subscribes
to “method acting.” ‘

0 Wash my car every week — with
an American ﬂag and soap made out
of baby snow seal fat.

- Make a point to praise libertineage
in every column I write.

- Write glowing columns about the
Ku Klux Klan, S&M fanatics, the
Pittsburgh Bisexual Aquanautics
Society, and the horse fanciers of
Allegheny County.

Somehow I don’t think I’ll carry
these off without being offensive, so
seven days into 1998, I’ve broken
one already. Pants!

So don’t look at the end of the
year as the end of things as you know
them. Fade out 1997, fade in 1998.
Two more years ‘til the new millenni-
um (2000 or 2001, depending on
whom you listen to), and I hope to
see you at the biggest party in Earth’s
history. ‘

And please don’t tell me your
plans for the year 2000 because I
know you’re going to break them.

James Maude’s next column will be
about uncomfortable sexual posi-
tions. So much for resolutions.

The cover of Pitt alumni Tom and

instead of starting a second Spanish

“Thanks for the tick-

Memphis
memories

As 50,000-plus people ﬂooded

past me through the Memphis night, I ‘

finally realized that our Pittsburgh
Panthers were in a bowl game.

I had been a radio-surﬁng passen-
ger for 13 hours filled with Ohio high
school basketball games, Kentucky
gibberish and some down—home
Tennessee twang that inspired me to
pop in a tape or two, but the actual fact
that we were playing in the postseason
still escaped me until I hit the home of
the blues.

As I walked along the one attrac-

tive street in all of Memphis, Beale
Street, and saw the Pitt contingent, it
made me proud to call myself a
Panther.

Alumni and fans poured in and out
of bars as early as 11:00 a.m. Tuesday,
especially the Blue and Gold—funded
soiree at the Rum Boogie Cafe.

It was home away from home as
the cover band played familiar tunes,
the Panther dance team made its way
up the spiral staircase (which by the
way is a great addition to any bar) and
the raucous Pitt alumni and fans chant-
ed those three lovely words —- “Penn
State Sucks.”

All responsibility was gone, and
soon all memories of my mother’s pre
voyage warning, “Don’t even call me
from some Memphis jail needing to get
out ‘cuz I’ll leave your ass there,” were
gone.

‘Tis the season, huh?

Unlike Pennsylvania, you were
free to walk around the streets with
drinks, fratemizing with the painfully
slow fans from Southern Mississippi
who think the Civil War is still under-
way.

But other than Beale Street,
Memphis —— the self-proclaimed
“Bluff City” -— was just that. A bluff.

Pittsburgh isn’t the greatest place
in the world, but as far as I’m con-
cerned, Elvis can keep Memphis. I’ll
take the Steel City any time.

Pittsburgh has its downsides.

Memphis is worse.

Sure, Pittsburgh has its fair share
of bad sections where “Snitches get
stitches.”

Memphis is worse.

Pittsburgh has enough restaurants
that are good going down but not so
good coming up.

polish off the meal with a slice of apple
pie (just like Elvis’ grandmother Gladys
used to make, so the menu advertises) or

enough to be served in a basin instead of
a bowl.

Food basins were popular for much
of the week, with tourists attempting to
sample the local cuisine (exceptions
would be members of the Pitt band and
cheerleading squads, who were spotted
at the more mainstream Hard Rock
Cafe). But on New Year’s night, basins

regular intervals.

No ball was dropped, but the crowd
made an unofﬁcial countdown around

ﬁlled the air. With help from a taxicab or

sorts made their way back to homes and
hotels.

For the many Pitt fans who traveled
far away for winter break, Pitt’s 72-61
drubbing of Notre Dame on Jan. 6 was a
retum revenge match, following a narrow
Irish win just a short time before.

Not really.

The two games were actually a month
apart, with Pitt (now 6-4, 1-2 in the Big
East) scheduled for ﬁve games in between.
Three were wins, one was a loss, and the
ﬁfth was cancelled due to snow.

The Panthers started their holiday
break with a 65-63 win over Navy. With
the narrow victory, Pitt avoided its third
consecutive defeat at Fitzgerald Field
House and evened their record at 3-3. The
game marked the season debut of redshirt
sophomore Kellii Taylor, who returned
from foot surgery.

Freshman forward Ricardo Greer ’s 23
points helped to sink the Midshipmen.
Greer led an early second—half outburst in
which he scored 12 of the Panthers’ ﬁrst 14
points.

“It was a big-time step up for a ﬁesh-
man,” Head Coach Ralph Willard said.

“We had no answers for him,” Navy
Coach Don DeVoe said “He’s a very
strong and conﬁdent basketball player.”

Pitt moved to 4-3 its next game, with
a 67-66 victory over Lafayette. The
Panthers played without star guard
Vonteego Cummings, who sat out with a
pulled calf muscle. Cummings injured his

left calf while playing one on one with
teammates Greer and Chris Gardella.

In Cummings’ absence, sophomore
guard Jarrett Lockhart poured in 19 points
and nine rebounds.

“He hasn’t been playing with any con-
ﬁdence and he’s been shooting very poor-
ly” Willard said, referring to Lockhart’s
32—percent shooting ' ' '
entering the game.
“We all know he can
shoot. And he does
rebound the basket-
ball.”

Lockhart provid-
ed the wirming points
when he rebounded a
miss by Greer, was
fouled by forward Ted
Cole, and converted
two free throws with
six seconds left.

Four seconds
later, Lockhart deﬂect-
ed a Lafayette pass to
Isaac Hawkins, pre-
serving the Panther
victory.

After Lafayette, Pitt took on the
Hawks of the University of Maryland-
Eastem Shore. The Mid-Eastem
Conference Hawks proved little trouble for
the Panthers, who came away with an 88-
51 winand upped their seasonmarkto 5-
3.

was called off due to snow —— a dangerous
amount of white stuff accumulated on the
roof of the dome, and the possibility of
deﬂating the dome for safety reasons
prompted a postponement. The game has
been rescheduled for Feb. 26 and will be
shown on Fox Sports Pittsburgh.
The hoops squad closed out its holi-
- ~ ‘:1 day season with a 73-

winning streak and
lowered the Panthers’
record to 5-4 overall
and 0-2 in the Big
East. Lockhart once
again provided the
offensive punch for
the Panthers, scoring a
career-high 24 points. Lockhart started in
place of Kellii Taylor, who sat out the
game because of pain in his left foot
Following a 24-24 halftime tie, the
Hurricanes exploited the Panthers’ inexpe-
rienced interior defense in the smond half.

time, and our kids played with more poise
against their pressure,” Miami Head
Coach Leonard Hamilton said.

‘es are slower and you can’t understand

the second half of anyone’s sentence.
Thank heaven the Pittsburgh Panthers
Alumni Association and the Liberty
Bowl people set up places for us
Yankees to enjoy full sentences, ﬂow-
ing booze and quality company.

What could be better than that?

The hotel formerly known as the
Welcome Inn America, that’s what.

This wasn’t just any hotel, it was
the perfect hotel for the trip. Three
beds, a living room, dining area, full
bath and kitchen for $100 a night.

Not bad for three people, but even
better for nine.

Didn’t the hotel management catch
us, you ask?

Not a chance, because once 4:00
p.m. came around, they rolled up the
sidewalks and took off.

Not one employee left.

Not a janitor, not a maid, not a desk
person. No one.

When we left Thursday night to get
back for the Steelers’ tailgate party
early Saturday morning, we checked
out of our room by sliding the three
keys underneath the office door and
leaving a note thanking them for their
bizarre hospitality.

You are probably wondering why I
haven’t mentioned the actual game yet.
