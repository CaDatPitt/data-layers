“Coimpetitofs invade A.T./8 T’s
Campus“ of the Future’

W‘

By Patty Vishnesky '
The Pitt News

Since the break up of AT&-T,
there has been a raging war between ’
several long distance telephone ser-
vices and the regional Bell Tele-
phone divisions. With the increasing
rates of AT&T, many long distance
callers are hitting the streets and
considering the pros and cons of the
new services. ‘

Despite Pitt’s multi-million dollar

. [contract with A.T. & T., intended to

‘,9

’ make _ Pitt the “Campus of the

,.-“Future, competitors are lobbying
hard for the lucrative college market
in long distant telephone calls.

‘US. Tel is the newest company to
hit Pittsburgh, They are. currently
combing thestreets looking for new

 

vegetables

customers. Headquartered in Dal-
las,»the new long distance phone ser-
vice is offering up to 50 percent
savings to its customers. This week
the service has touched all"Pitts-
burgh area college campuses.

“This is our first year in Pitts-
burgh," said Melanie Towne, a U.S.
Tel representative, “We’re trying to
expand so we can save a lot of people
a lot of money.” Currently, the ser-

vice is available in 72 cities in they

U.S. and Puerto Rico and is in its
ﬁfth year of » o-peration. The rates are
designed much like those of AT&T,
with day, evening and weekend
rates, but at a lower cost.

,The «difference between_U.S. Tel
and MCI,'one of its competitors, is
the mode of transmitting calls.
Unlike MCI that transmits calls by

satellite, U.S. Tel leases the tele-

Mentor Program:

success story

By Joel A. Bloom
and Christopher L. Wells

For The Pitt News
Just how successful was the men-
tor program this year?

“It was remarkably successful for
everyone this year,” said Bob Firth,

coordinator for the new student pro- '
grams. Firth is a five-year veteran of i

the new student programs and has
seen 2700 freshmen enter Pitt this

1 ‘year alone, a new record.

  ‘Gruesome’

murders

shock Calif

LOS ANGELES (UPI) —' Cali-
fornia attorney general John Van de
Kamp said at least 15 gruesome
murders were solved when convicted
killer Henry Lee Lucas made an
exhaustive tour of California with
law officers, telling where and how
14 female victirn‘s‘and one male were
murdered. ,

“Lucas is considered to be one’ of
the most brutal mass murderers in
this nation's history. He did virtually
every kind of crime known to man,"
said Van de Kamp.

Lucas, who's been sentenced to
die in Texas, has claimed to have
committed more than 360 murders
nation-wide during an eight-year
spree.

Authorities have linked him with
175 killings, including the 15 con-
firmed during his trip to California.

Van de Kamp and Lucas claimed
he and a companion —— Ottis Toole,
who is in prison in Florida for
murder, arson and other crimes ——
committed the California killings
from 1975 to 1983 following Lucas’
release from a Michigan prison.

“Over one third of all freshmen
who enrolled in Pitt attended and
participated in the mentor pro-
gram," Firth said. From the expres-
sion on his face, one could tell he was
pleased with the results.

For the last ten years, the mentor
program has been helping many
incoming freshmen to a spirit of
unity, brotherhood and understand-
ing between the freshmen them-
selves, the faculty and the rest of the
student body. The mentor program
is one of the oldest, New Student
Programs at Pitt. According to
Firth, “The main goal of the mentor
program is to enable the freshmen to
feel at home." Firth said the pro-
gram was designed to tell the fresh-
men, “What it is, why it is, and what
it is doing for us.” Firth continued,
“There are 100 mentors picked out
of over 300 applicants. The mentor
job’ normally lasts for two years.”

After a training program the men-

tors are ready to meet the incoming“

freshmen during the three-day
orientation period. The freshmen,

On Wednesday afternoon, a high-
voltage cable failure caused black-
outs in four campus buildings.

In Thackeray Hall long lines of
students stood waiting to register or
pay for the fall term when the lights
shut off. The darkness caused tem-
porary confusion, and all business
stopped. There were no problems,
but students were asked to leave,

according to one unidentified
student.
“We received no complaints,

although we did have to transfer a
couple of classes," Rooms and Sche-
duling Manager Peter La Civita said
yesterday.

The cause of the cable failure is
still unknown, but a work crew from
Sargent Electric corporation .is
investigating. According to the
crew’s foreman Glen Schindehette,
the -faulty cable was located beneath
O'Hara Street between Allen Hall
and the Vandergraff building.

Schindehette said that repairs to
the damaged cable will be costly.

“Any time you mess with 500 mcm .
[high-voltage cable], repairs are_
quite expensive,” he said.

The exact cause of the power fail-
ure and the repair costs will riot,be
known until the endof the week.

; To most people,’the word Pyma-
 tuning means weekend camping
' along the lake shore, as in the area’s
motto, “where ducks walk on fish."

 " For some of Pitt’s- students. this
 summer, Pymatuning meant lots of
 fun taking courses in ecology at the
4!; Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecol-
; ogy. Some of us got there in May to
‘ attend the first session, others in
,, June and July to attend the second
,_ and last session. We all had one
thing in common: we didn't know

what to expect. ,

The car raised a thick cloud of
dust on the old dirt road; civilization
seemed to be left behind. Another

.3’, hundred feet of dirt road across a
1, mixed forest and there we were — at
‘* the housing area located 3 miles
away from the lab site. Rustic sim-
plicity characterized the area with
wooden dorms and cabins scattered
onbotn sides or a aistantcousin to
the usual city parking lot. All this —
only a hundred feet away from the
» lake. The sky above the tree tops
I seemed very ‘blue and  could it
really be?  yeah!’lt was clear! No
i orange smog~ beneath it.
‘ Another surprise was the dining
. hall — thought you wouldn't know
, anybody? One look around and ._..
 the girl in yellow definitely looked
j familiar  oh yeah, she was in
Organic! That was enough to ﬂash a
‘a big smile, gain lots of conﬁdence and "
A walk straight to her; she seemed like
 an old friend. That guy ‘to her right
  yeah, he was in Environmental
 Bio last fall. The next person was
4 there too! And already we felt at
. home. In one day, we were good
friends with all those we have seen a ,
million times at Pitt and others we
met from Edinboro, IUP and
Clarion.

Once classes started, time passedk
very quickly. Here is why. ‘ -

The day usually started at 7:30,
although the alarm went off at 7:00.
The Vertebrate Ecology might have
gone bird-watching at 6:00. It was a
drag to get out of the cozy, warm
sleeping bag — “Oh, it’s OK to stay
here five more minutes.” But the bell

' warned that breakfast would be over
in a half hour. As always, the water

' had a dark brown color gradually
turning normal, colorless. There was
a half-inch long ant crawling on the
wall above the sink. The sweat suit‘
felt a little damp. Outside, the air
was.cold and fresh. A flock of Cana-
dian geese were feeding along the.
shore. " '

Breakfast consisted of eggs or
pancakes, and sometimes, French
toast. There might not have been a
great variety], but why complain?
The honk came at quarter to nine, .
when the vans left for .the lab.

'  3 Classes started around nine. In
mycology it usually meant writer’s
cramp for about two hours and an
early end before lunch. The Verte-

nd salamanders in Summer School

brate Ecology class went out into the
field collecting and observing. A
milk snake they caught one day was
met with a special interest by all as it
tried to bite into a cloth, and once it
did, it didn't want to let go. The
“salamander” project became so
popular that not only did the mycol-
ogy class catch salamanders while
collecting fungi on our field trips,
but several students from other
classes went on a “salamander night
hunt" to capture them for popula-
tion estimate purposes. That night
we must have used up at least a can
of “Off” insect repellent, yet mosqui-

' tos delivered attack after attack. Try

to see if the salamander has one toe
clipped when it is squirming and
mosquitos are ‘biting your backside
through your jeans.

Limnology, the most populated
class, spent‘ "time analyzing lake
water and identifying water
organisms. _ .

After lunch, stuffed with “Doris
bars” — chocolate chip cookies
home-made by » our great cook

Doris, we sat around the deck chat-
ting. Most classes resumed at 1:00
p.m. On sunny days there was a two:
hour beach time or a motor boat
ride. And then back to the lab or into

the field around 3:00 to'identify 3

those -mushrooms.

Field trips taken every week took
us to many interesting places like
Allegheny National Forest, Presque
Isle and Knox — a reclaimed strip
mine. We were back just in time for
dinner, our labs full of specimens to
identify. , '

The volleyball game was an every-
day event right after dinner. Our
professors frequently joined and
probably the greatest form was exhi-
bited by the. Mycology professor
only six months after a heart attack.
Talk‘ about spirit! One way to get the
opposite team was to yell: “A bald
eagle!” and point to the sky. And
yes, we have reallyseen bald eagles
at Pymatuning. _

Around 8:00 p.m. it was back to

the lab site to study, the library was

\full only before the midterms and

 

finals". There hadto be time saved for
bonfires on the lake shore and wee-
kend trips to the movies in Mead-
ville. On the way there, there was the
best ice cream shop around —
“Hanks” — which we visitedoften.

The last session at the lab this
summer was a lttle different for
tho'se of us taking Wildlife Manage-
ment. And it wasn’t because of the

soine hair off their backside that it is
very hard to hold them without
squeezing or getting one’s finger

management plan which involved
many hours of research andvtalks
with game protectors. Thought that
all-nighters are- pulled. only during
regular semesters? Not" so. They
were pulled at Pymatuning, too. But
still, it wasn't anything like we could
have experienced at the main
campus. ~

But there was something. new in

Was ‘it the blueberry patch on the

are assigned to small groups for the
mentors to show them around cam-
pus and to tell them when and where
scheduled events and classes will
start.

The mentors and the freshmen
share a common interest in each
other because all of them are stu-
dents at Pitt.

“I was from out of state when I
was a freshman,” Jim Burchfield
stated. “I was very lonelv when I first
arrived at Pitt and the mentors
helped out a lot. I thought by getting
involved I could help this year’s
freshmen.”

Firth stressed that _the incoming
freshmen should not focus on what
the mentors are doing for them

‘exclusively, but what they are doing

for the entire student body as well.

Junior Athena Zaras commented,
“I enjoyed meeting the new fresh-
men. It was good way for me to get
to know the university."

, The freshmen get socially
involved with the mentors and other

‘upperclassmen. “By the end of

Orientation, the freshmen were
inviting me to come along to their
parties,” one mentor said.

- Donna Tratynek, a sophomore .

mentor, said “I enjoyed "meeting
people and gaining their trust. They
knew they had someone to talk to."

There were mentor groups for
transfer students here at Pitt this
year. One student from Penn State
reports that there is no comparison,
“Pitt is it.” _ ‘ ‘

By Lisa B. Keer
The Pitt News

I have this special relationship
with salad: if I see another head of
lettuce, I'll scream, but then again, I
do realize the benefits of Boston Bib.
While I can't do anything about the
standard salad stuff, alternatives to
banality are fast emerging on the
fruit front.

American produce purveyors are
starting to pick up on exotic fruits,
so you can kiss pears, plums and
peaches goodbye in favor of quince,
cactus pears and star fruit.

Local grocery stores regularly
stock such accepted exotics as the
fuzzy kiwi berry, papaya and
pineapple, but you may have to go
farther aﬁeld to find fruits recently
introduced in the United States, like

, the cherimoya or the star fruit.

I The Green Grocer on Murray
Avenue in Squirrel Hill has been in
business for 25 years and handling
exotic fruit for “as long as its been
around." according to employee

Howie Ehrlichman. “If it’s available,
we would carry it."

Like many other area markets, the
Green Grocer gets its fruit from
wholesalers in the Strip District,
much of which comes from Califor-
nia, New York or Florida.

According to a spokesperson for
Descalzi Produce Company, Pitts-
burgh is a “big market" for exotic
fruit.

If in your travels you happen to
spot an oval object with artichoke-
like leaves, chances are good it’s a
cherimoya. Cut it open and you'll
discover a rich white pulp which
tastes something like vanilla sherbet,
but has only 27 calories per ounce.
The cherimoya can be eaten as is, or
used in dessert cooking. It may well
be the “big" fruit this seasonfor all
you trendy types. The cherimoya,
however, has yet to debutin the city.

The star fruit, or more properly,
carambola, is perhaps. the most
attractive of the new fruits. This pale
yellow item with a waxy exterior
gets its name from what occurs when
you cut it across. Lo and behold, you

get a juicy, star-shaped piece of
citrus-like fruit. The entire fruit is
edible, although if not quite ripe, the
rind imparts a slightly’ bitter taste.
The carambola is a nice alternative
to oranges or grapefruit, although
the verdict is still out on how it fares
when cooked. For the best ﬂavor,
chill the star fruit before you
indulge.

If you enjoy oranges, keep an eye
out for the blood orange. It gets its
name from the vivid_ color of its
pulp, and is a juicy, ﬂavorful version
of its Sunkist cousin. The blood
orange does have seeds.

Not all of these fruits are without
problems, however. The cactus pear
falls right into this category. It's a
small fruit and it has a dark green
rind. It is about the same size as a

kiwi berry, although nowhere near
as smooth.‘ I picked up a handful of
soft but painful thorns at the base of
the cactus fruit, so be forewarned.
The cactus pear should be pliable
to the touch, but not mushy. The
rind comes off easily to reveal a
bright pink fruit. Like the pome-
granate, the cactus pear is filled with
small seeds which you can pick out,
or if you’re like me, swallow. This
fruit tastes like mushy watermelon
with a citrus aftertaste. I did dis-
cover, as in the case of the star fruit,
that the cactus pear, tastes measura-
bly better if . it’s been" refrigerated.‘
Many of these fruits are readily

available in Pittsburgh. Prices vary _

and most exotic fruits are sold on a

Do_ keep in mind that these fruits
have been cultivated in their native

‘countries for many years and are

new primarily to American palates.

. Much of the interest in exotic fruits

was generated by the new trends in
health and fitness according to a
spokesperson from Giant Eagle’s

produce headquarters in the Strip

District.

The introduction and populariza-
tion of such existing and abundant
fruits and vegetables may herald a

THE FIXX
"Syria Mosque
September 6, 1984

”lBly Bryan—J . Fischer

T If you've ever listened to a Fixx
' album all the way through, you may
. have gotten the impression that this
is a band struggling to say something
‘very important. Last night at the
Syria Mosque, the struggle
continued. a
Before a diminutive crowd, lead
 singer Cy Curnin’s theatrical cales—
I tenics coaxed his band througlia se_t
that drew enthusiastic response for
radio—ready numbers like ”Red
Skies/'2 ”One Thing Leads To
 Another” and their current single,
C‘ ”Are We Ou‘rselves?,” yet Curnin’s
 ”message" seemed stronger in pre-
 ciselythose songs that the audience
' ‘was least able to grab hold of.
 This dichotomy of accessible music
.. .tl:1_at is immediately captivating for its
stripped-down minimalist approach
‘ A built on little but a clever hook versus
the heavily muddledallegory of songs
 like ’’Reach the Beach” and ”Run-
 ning". ‘puts the Fixx in 9a musical
quandry that the band"‘co'nv'eniently
skirts: ’.’Ar_e We,Oursel_ves2" in fact
‘Tasks a mofe"intére'stin'g‘ _question of
“I the band's intention ~ “—- is _it‘-tobe Ma
socially relevant oran accessible rock
“band 4- than whatever it is the song
_ vaguely’alludes to. " A j »
Curnin speaks of personal visions
 that his songs attempt toexercise, yet
 yhis approach offers two pitfalls that

.l
l. the band seems unable to escape.

  
  
  
    

i

Ifit ain't broke, don't Fixxit -

.. x’ -;~~'.J

One, supposing that’ a listening
audience will take an interest in
issuesthat concern him, and two,
more dangerous than the first, hiding

backbeat in order to be not only ”rele—
vant" but commercially successful as
well. ’ .

The second pitfall is evident in
much of that same material -”Phan-
toms,” the title track _to the band's

"latest record, for example — which
for all of its oppressiveness adds up to
something much less than the state- 
ment this band seems so desperately
after. ‘ \

In watching the Fixx work their
way through a generous set of nearly
two dozen songs, there was a striking
indifference to those that never made
their way onto the airways. Although
many bands suffer when audiences
come only to see ‘hits, the problem for
the Fixx is that they claim to, be doing
important things — inspite of being
unable to attract much attention to
them. i I M ;

, ‘The Fixx are hyeadlining a7toLfr..for
the‘ first time -in this ,c;oUunt_ry, which

' will put them under »‘_'1j'_r_1g’>’1'_{_e.*j,ll\g.\,'¢I.'a".;t“_<,‘.~lv‘;Iful

eyes than ever before.\_By"' playing
before audiences‘that.ha._ve "come spe—'
cifically to see them ‘—¥-land n-ot',7'«for
instance, the Police, who the band
opened for last year the Fixx inay‘
yet come to appreciatethe vital inter-
action that goes on between a band.
and its "audience I:ess'ti'me”spe__nt. con?

are_ only of interest under the direc-
tion of ‘a good-looking lead singer a_nd

"I consider her someone very rare. You ‘

don't come across a person of her caliber
often." Henry Fonda on Katharine
Hepburn

"I'm a personality as well as an actress.

; Show me an actress who isn't a personality,
' and you'll show me a woman who isn't a_ star.

A star's personality has to shine through.-"
Katharine vHepburn on Katharine
Hepburn —

Hollywoodehad never run into any-

' thing like Kate Hepburn. Strikingly
beautiful‘ — those high cheekbone-s —
and with a temperament that seemed
to match the appearance; she pio-
neered nonconformity in a place
where imitation was the sincerest
‘form of survival. She challenged crit-
ics and the moviegoing public and

daredthem to love her or hate her.
_ But F. Scott Fitzgerald said, "I like
Katharine Hepburn in anything."

cut, the second of six children of a
surgeon and a suffragette. ”My child-_
hood gax/eme a sort of freedom from
fear,” Hepburn once said; and" later,
”I’ve done what I wanted to do, and
most of it was intentional.” ' .
A graduate of »Bryn"Mawr, Hep-
burn jumped immediately into stock

theater and from there to Broadway '

with off-a'nd—o‘n success. RKO con-
tracted herin 1932. for~A Bill of Divorce-
ment, opposite John Barrymore, and
she headed , _'west to the Movie
Capitol.’ _ ' '

For filmgoers, it. was love at first
sight. Early promise bloomed, and
she picked up an Academy Awardfor
her third film, Morning Glory (1933). A
fine version of Little Women followed
along ‘with’ several other good pic-
tures, but the Hepburn/critics/public.
romance faded quickly. Box office.
dropped, and the Independent Thea-
tre Owners of America declared tier
poison in 1938.

She deserted Hollywood for Broad-

way and a hit play, The Philadelphia‘

Story. She purchased the film rights,

', sold them (and herself) to MGM and

chose her director and co-stars. The

1 movie broke attendance records, -and

Hepburn climbed back on top and

stayed. Nineteen-forty-two hitched '

her— with Spencer Tracy for the first
time in Woman of the Year, beginniniza
25-yearypartnership \on- and off-
screen. Tracy and Hepburn blended

arrogance and affection for an
unmatched chemistry sustained A

through nine films.

Twelve Academy Award nomina-
tions have -netted herrfour Oscars,
making. her the Academy's most
honoredindividual. She has returned
frequently to the stage — Shakes-

peare, comedy, contemporary drama,

even a musical -—’ and has rernained

‘distinctively active in the movies as

well. Her latest film, The Ultimate Solu-
tion of Grace Quigley, is due for release
later this year. - _ ..
”Nobody ever won a Nobel Prize
for acting,” Hepburn once remarked.
That oversight might be remedied;
certainly the evidence is overwhelm-
ing. And for the uninitiated, the
Pittsburgh Playhouse Film Repertory
(222 Craft Avenue) presents its first
Katharine Hepburn Film Festival.
Playhouse film director Richard

’Rauh' has scheduled 25 Hepburn
films. (arranged-rnore.,or less chronoe - V -

logically) for as many days; showings
began Wednesday and will continue
until the end of the month with two_
shows’nightly. Highlights, and there

are a lot of ’em, include her four 

Academy Award winning perfor-
mances: Morning Glory (1933), as Eva
Lovelace, a naive but talented actress;
Guess Who's Coming To Dinner (1967),
with she and Spencer Tracy as con-
cerned parents; The Lion in Winter.
(1968), as Eleanor of Aquitaine ver-
sus husband Henry II of England
(Peter O'Toole); and On Golden Pond
(1981), married to Henry Fonda and
aging with dignified grace.

The eight others she earned nomi- 

nations for represent more cream of
the crop: the' social climbing Alice
Adams (1935, a heartbreaker); the
spoiled rich girl central to The Philadel-
phia Story (1940, a brittle and brilliant

.manners comedy); the newspaper

columnist- elected Woman of the Year

.. (1942); three spinsters -4- aboard The

African Queen (1951), in Rome during
the jSumme_rtime (1955) and in the
U.S.'A. in The Rainmaker (1956); and
two matriarchs — remembering
events that happened Suddenly last

, Summer (1959)‘and descending a drug-

addicted'Long Day's ]ourney"into Night
(1962). i -

And still room for some superlative
comedy:  Hepburn as an e aspiring
actress in the wisecracking Stage Door
(1937); as the unconventionalsister
of the bride ‘who believes that life
shpuld be a Holiday (1938); Chasing a
leopard and Cary Grant in Bringing up
Baby (also 1938, and cure screwball);

response to ”seen any good movies

Playhouse provides required viewing

opportunity; there's no substitute for
quality. "I’m not a morning glory!”
Eva Lovelace announces desperately
in the wake of her successful debut at
  ' the conclusion of that film.

sun. And she intends to prove as
much.

' Katharine Hepburn has kept he .
private life. Hollywood accepted her
on her own terms. She still dislikes
interviews, dismisses autograph
seekers and refuses to answer per-
sonal questions —- admirable res-
traint in the era of tell all. ”I_don’t care
_what’s written about me so long as it
isn't true," she remarked several
years ago. " j

Which leaves, of course, the‘
movies. But the camera, like a magni- _

”A cop on the edge/_' the ad says,

and it refers to Clint Eastwood doing-

Tightrope -— he's a homicide investiga-
tor again, the determination and
squint and the requisite luck intact.
Except what makes Tightrope more
than a mirror reflection of the Dirty
Harry pictures is its refinement of a
screen image — a startlingly three-
dimensional character and justice
done’ to it: a perceptive, solid perfor-
mance from Eastwood. ~

The film offers a deliberate —
although hardly leisurely-paced —
travelogue of Wes Block, a vulnerable
family man with a chancy job and
some "quite human weaknesses. He's
getting old. He has a soft spot for

A strayldogs, is divorced and is raising
(two young daughters ("about the

only part of my life I haven't screwed
up," he says) who are trapped
between their parents’ wordless
animosity.

Block, bitter over thefailure of his

marriage and the upcoming possibil-
ity of losing his children, "finds solace

in drink and sad jazz‘... and also in '
' violent, furtive sexual activity. "Out

looking for something" is- his wry

tracking down the masked man ‘mol- _

esting and then strangling the city's

Block's painful anger and fear

 increase sharply with the discovery
"of each new victim; his disturbing

realization that théj'killer~'s sexual

But Wes Block commands focus
since his habits and his obligations

Eastwood proves himself an actor to
be reckoned with; given proper cir-

any other performer in recent

,B|ood money in the -LoneSTor state

x

By Michael Selz

There may be an anti-techno back-
lash at work here. The last year or
two have seen a growing number of
stripped-down ‘movies in hometown
U.S. locales, without lasers, space-
ships, monsters _ or gut-churning
physical transformations. No special
effects, just drama, character, con-
flict ——, remember those terms? Flash-
point is another of those great action
and suspense films where the magic
is not in how big the budget is but
how engaging the plot and characters
are. .

Kris Kristofferson and Treat Willi-
ams portrayroornmates, buddies and
partners on the US. Border Patrol
who get the job of planting electronic
sensors in the ground that, in radar

, fashion, will sniff out illegal aliens.

l

This-job, once complete, will render
obsolete about two-thirds of the

patrol force. The_”Washington man” .

in charge. of this operation is Mr. Car-

son (Kurtwood Smith), who.sets.a V ‘

new standard for ruthlessness. A .
On this same morning, the pair dis-rs
cover two female telephone company
employees stranded on the mesa with
car «trouble, ‘ fueling the requisite‘
romantic. angle. g
morning, ‘Logan (Kristofferson) dis.‘
covers la-jeep: and a corpse that have

been buried‘ in a rnudflat for __twenty__ 
years — no/_ big" deal until he" finds 

on} is -rnlade..tolfeel that Logan

and‘gWiatt really care ahouteach .
 othémnrot. with, the .prescribed,

cliches of current Hollywood '
conventions, but with the work-
ings and_ dynamic ofa real world
relationship. If

$800,000 in cash under the molder-

:. ing seat of the car.

All these disparate events become
related as the film proceeds, and the
tangled web keeps the viewer per-
plexed and engaged in it for the dura-
tion, no small feat in these days of the
three-and—a—half—min.ute attention
span.

The two protagonists, Logan and

- Wiatt, offer a refreshingly rich reper-
‘ toire_ of human interaction. They dis-
. play a believable and» complexbond

free of clichedadolescent foolishness.

Later the same " A

Treat Williams’ hot-blooded excesses A

are kept to a minimum, a "good move
for a greatactor who tends to overdo
it at times. ‘

Nevertheless, Wiatt is a young
idealist who really believes in the job
he does. Logan, however, works for

‘the nomadic border patrol to remove

himselfl"from the men, ideals, and

walls and ceilings of convention.
The huge webs of crow’s-feet

around the corners of his eyes betray

who has been having conscience
problems from the start, concedes,
”Qkay, I'll. take the money” — and he's
serious." Logan, of course-, thanks him
profusely.

The film features Tess I-Iarper, last
seen in the critically acclaimed Tender
Mercies. She pl\ays one of the phone
operators and gives a good rendition‘
of the ”tough on the outside, tender
within” quality that Logan wears so
well. _

Rip Torn portrays the only other
character who seems wholesome and
sincere in this”tale of uncertain alle-
giances. He is Kevin Conway, the old
town Lsherriff, who” worked with
Logan's father. -. IA '  . .

THE ABOLITION
Jonathan Schell
Alfred A. Knopf

If the ‘bombing of Nagasaki and
Hiroshima has taught mankind any-
thing, itvis that atomic warfare must
never be employed again. Yet since
(1945, the powers of the world, most
notably the U.S. and the U.S.S.-R,

“ffiave embarked on a dangerous and

uncertain path of trying to beat each
other’s respective nuclear destructive
capabilities. Western leaders have
often pronounced ”peace through
strength” as their cornerstone of mil-
itary defense policy.
Seemingly, only deterence stops
”the button” from being pressed
down; (deterence prevents us from
assuring a mutual self—destruction.
Yet a question begs to be asked: How‘!
-much deterence is enough? Jonathan’
Schell has tackled the question head-
on and has provided us with a
refreshingly different perspective.
The Abolition is divided into two

I parts. The first part, ”Defining the

emotional motivation for authoring

posed solutions for ending the arms
race‘ as well as the many ’,’post-
explosion" theories forwarded by
many top -scientists and thinkers.
The second part, ”A Deliberate Pol-
icy,” fleshes out Schell’s proposal.
Noting that deterence has prevented
nuclear war but the proliferation of

~ nuclear arms has lowered our«chan-
ces for survival, he advances the idea

of maintaining anabsolute minimal
deterence. The world would scrap all
of its nuclear _armaments, creating a
nuclear weapon—free world while
maintaining deterence by prudently
keeping plants designed for the
manufacture of nuclear weapons
ready. I

' This proposal is defensibleffor ‘as
Schell points out, nuclear knowledge
is a science and as such cannot be
disavowed. Secondly, the lead-time
(the time it would take from the time

‘the nuclear switch -was pulled until

the bomb detonates — at present a

’ ‘iv'Sli3iivcase, Fiiday, S

All’rheworld’s ostoge .. .

 '(7.‘ 4.1171’-a“"“' -.-

       

matter of several minutes) would be
increased significantly. This lead-
time increase could be the time we
need to settle our differences.

The problem and main arguments

in nuclear arms talks have always '

centered on the problem of verifica-
tion. Is the other side cheating? The
question breeds a mutual wave of
suspicion. Yet Schell offers the solu-
tion of using our satellite technology
to do the job, a technology that pres-
ently functions in this capacity to a
large degree. Rapid strides in'compu-
ter technology will cqntinue to lend
credibility to the matter of
verification. ..

' What if we are caught flat-footed
in the_ proposed nuclear weapon-free
world and are attacked by a strike
eliminating our capacity for rearma-
ment of nuclear weapons?

”The task for strategy in.a nuclear-
free world would be to design a capac-
ity for nuclear rearmament which
‘could not be destroyed in a firststrike
by a nation that took the lead in rear-

mament by abrogating the abolition '

agreement, secretly or openly,”
Schell responds. ’ '

The book itself is thorough in its
explanations, details and admonish-
ments and leaves the discerning
reader with a clear picture. The book
also points a finger of blame toward
none, whereas similar publications
are rife with ‘accusations and
innuendo. '

Here then is Jonathan Schell, a
social thinker deeply concerned about

thefuture of the world and a liberal .

as social thinkers go who has'never—
theless put aside accepted status quo
and ideological notions to deliver a
book that has displayed sound judge-
ment and a pragmatic thinking about
a matter affecting all mankind in a
way that not merely kindles in us
hope but leads us maturely to see;that
there is an obtainable goal toward a
nuclear-free. world.

It is left to us to obtain that goal.-.
’ Godspeed in doing so. ’

BOGIE AND ME
Verita Thompson
Pinnacle

Bogie and Me chronicles a 15-year“

affair between actor Humphrey Bogart
and Verita Thompson, his personal
hairdresser and secretary of sorts. Most
surprising is not that the relationship
existed but, instead, the author's audac-
ity in describing it. Her preface voices
concernthat she would remain a “sleazy
footnote” in the Bogart legacy unless
the real story were told. Ironically,
aided by the book, the reader reaches a
similar conclusion. 0'

Bogie and Me confesses — and deliv-
ers — a one-sided picture of the actor.
The brunt of the biographical informa-
tion here belongs to the author, but
since Thompson’s claim to the limelight
is nothing beyond the affair with
Bogart, her book is curiously lopsided.

Sh'e fails to create a sympathetic por-
trait of Bogart or even -of herself;
Thompson’s Bogart spent most of his
time arranging for bedroom activity
with her, drinking scotch and soda and
playing elaborate practical jokes
between his film assignments. But he
also found time to father two children
with wife Lauren Bacall as well as to

THE WPA GUIDE TO ILLINOIS
By the Federal Writers’ Project
Pantheon

President Franklin Roosevelt set up
the Works Progress Administration,
among other programs, to combat the
Great Depression in the 1930s by pro-
viding mass employment. Anyone,
apparently, could get a job in his field of
experience with the WPA, and the
agency gave work to, thousands. One
division, calling itself the Federal Wri-
ters’ Project, devoted its time in part to
compiling state guidebooks of history
and travel information. The project
lasted nearly eight years; 51 guides
covered the 48_ states, Washington,
D.C., Alaska and’Puerto Rico.

The odds are one to four that you can.

The WPA Guide to Illinois offers a sur-
prisingly readable panorama of she

state — its land, people, government, .

labor, education, art, music and
literature.

Since many authors contributed to -

the volume and none of the individual
articles lists an author, the guide is
something of a stylistic surprise pack-

age, some of it rather dreadful and duil,  0

most of it entertaining and newsy. Pro-
ﬁles of major -cities ﬁll one-third of the

book, and 22 outline tours covering , .

most of the state's territory and attrac-
tions complete the set.

Naturally, much of the information -

has become inaccurate due to urban.

prices, respectively —— since the book’:
ﬁrstappearance in 1939. For those of us

who didn't live through it, the Deprcs-A "A

Quartet expected to-
bolster spikers in ‘84

By Laurie Kubll ’
The _Pitt News
The Pitt women's volleyball team

returns to the hardwood at Trees
Hall tomorrow in a match against

‘Pitt standouts from previous cham-

pionship teams.

The spikers will begin digging for
Big East gold this year, following a
disappointing season of ups and’
downs wrought by a lack of lea_der-
ship. Now, however, an experieiiced
quartetof seniors and a fresh atti-
tude borne of old memories and new
responsibility portend a successful
season to come.

. Coach Shelton Collier said that
having four seniors puts the team in
a “unique” situation, as opposed to
having no seniors last year. “It will
make a big difference in our consis-
tency‘ and our success this year,” he
said.

“Last year, we lacked the senior
leadership [necessary] in college col-
lege sports,” Collier said.

Tomorrow's 2 p.m. match fea-
tures the stars of yesterday and
today. Seniors Pat Belcher and
Cathy Rupp and first-team all-Big
East selections Ulana Kohutiak and
Judy Young will lead the way for
Pitt. ' V

The alumni squad brings back the
movers and the shakers of the past,
including Cindy Chambers, Paula
Olsen McGee, Robin Kukalis, Ellen
Mangus Toy, Tina Newton and Col-
lier’s assistant coach Julie Gaul.

Collier _regards Chambers as the
“the best middle blocker ever at Pitt
and in the East.” He also said that
Olsen was regarded a “one of the top
spikers in college, and I regard her as
the finest player ever at Pitt.

“And Julie Gaul, whose name is
synonymous with Pitt volleyball the
past five or six years, and has repres-
ented Pitt at championships and
sports festivals regularly."

Collier said the match, pits the
“No. 1 spiker now with the No. 1
spiker then. Olsen was an accomp-
lished senior 3 years ago, and Ulana
was a freshman and has improved in
four" years.”

Kohutiak, whose “lightning-
quick armswing” earned her the No.
l spiker’s spot on the team, said that
the team’s jaunt to North Carolina
for a two-week training camp eli-
cited improvements.

“We had‘a good attitude going in,
and our skills really improved,” she
said. “It was intense.”

, Setter Rupp called the experience

“unbelievable; we got closer —— I got’

to know people better.” She says the
experience , will be positively
reflected in the game situation.

“I ‘think we’ll look at each other
and want to win,” Rupp said. “This
is our last chance. A couple people
on the court have to say ‘we’re not
giving in.’ No one was willing to say
that last year." ’

Young ecnoed Rupp’s description
of this season as a last chance. How-
ever. she does not think that the lack
of leadership was directly responsi-
ble for last year’s roller-coaster turn
of events.

“It didn't hurt us last year, but it
will help us this year,” Young stated.

To Belcher, being a senior brings
added responsibility. “I feel obli-
gated to display leadership and set
an example for the younger
players.”

the alumni match will enable
Belcher to show the older spikers
what she’s learned and how she’s

:

improved since she was a freshman.
“It’ll be fun," she said. “It’s our first
opportunity to show how hard we've
been working.” ‘

Collier said that his squad mainly
worked on defensive skills in North

Carolina — “digging” the ball from ’

the floor. Theplayers spent three
hours a day on defense _and three
more on other aspects of volleyball,

Collier is hoping to see improved
defense as a result. “It was really
valuable in improving our individ-
ual defense, which will be necessary
[tomorrow]. ‘ 
' Rupp thinks that the match will .
be exciting and is looking forward to
the remainder of the season while
keeping an eye on the past. The team
played in tournaments in its “off”
season — from January to the end of
the term in April —— and the players,
did not have an easy time of it.

“We struggled with confidence at
the first tournaments, but then we
realized what we had to do,” Rupp
said. “We grew together.”

She said that she did not think
overconﬁdence was a problem last
year, despite Co'llier's reiteration of
a championship season and the
team’s failure to win the Big East
championship. As a matter of fact,
expectations are largely the same.

“The expectations are still the
same, but the perspective is differ-‘
ent,” she said.

Game Serves: Open tryouts for
the Pitt women’s volleyball team will
be held on Sunday, Sept. 9, at 5 p.m.
in Trees Hall. An additional tryout
will be held on Tuesday, Sept. 1 l, at
5:30 p.m., also in Trees Hall. Several
positions are available, and Coach
Collier is encouraging all athletes
with a desire to participate to try
out.

New kicks: Luxbacher

By Keith Yannessa
The Pitt News

«Joe Luxbacher.

The name may not mean much to
many Pitt students, but to the Pitt
soccer team and to their fansthe
name conjures up a very possible
winning season. Luxbacher, who is
the new head coach of the team_,
brings with him a knowledge of
soccer that the Panthers respect and
yearn to absorb.

Luxbacher played professional
soccer with both the North Ameri-
can Soccer League and the Ameri-
can Soccer League, the Philadelphia
Atoms and the Pittsburgh Spirit.
Those pro days began in 1975 and
ended four years later.

He replaces the legendary Leo
Bemis, whose heading coaching stint
with the Panthers spanned four
After retiring last
December, Bemis has since moved
on to coach Robert Morris’ soccer
club.

With Luxbacher comes a new
assistant coach, Dan Dunmyer.
“We're really fortunate Dan will be
joining our staff,” said Luxbacher.
“It’s not too often that you can find a
person with Dan’s experience who
can work with the field players and
has experience as a goalie.”

Dunmyer earned All-Conference
honors at Bethany College as a
goalie in 1976 and as a striker in
1977. ‘

The most obvious and important
thing that Luxbacher has. brought
with him is at changein attitude.

While pursuing equality
amongst the ranks, there is also
an effort being made toward
involving more of the broadcast
jocks. So, what better mike per-
sonality to confront than Tom
Walsh, sports director of WPTS-

Only thing is, does he know the

The Pitt News: Friday, September , 1984,

Bruce shooting  
for 3rd straight

Big East MVP

By Christine Kyle
For The Pitt News

When passing an area play--

ground, don’t be surprised to see Pitt
women’s basketball standout Jen-
nifer Bruce of Carrick challenging
the men_to a pickup game.

To some, Bruce may look out of
place on the asphalt or hardwood
court. A statuesque beauty, her
charm and good looks are better
suited to a Madison Avenue model
than a basketball forward.

Bruce has made her mark in bas-
ketball, however. She enters her
senior season in third place on the
Lady Panthers’ all-time scoring list
with 1,164 career points. Bruce is
just 24 points shy of second place
and has a legitimate chance of
breaking Debbie Lewis’ school

‘record of 1,941. She scored 666

points last season and needs 327 to
top the scoring chart.

Bruce, a 6-0 forward for the Lady I

Panthers, is excited about the‘
upcoming season.

“I can’t _ wait until the season
starts,” she said. “I’m playing as
inuch as I can this summer. I wish
the season would start in September
instead of in October. I’m ready.”

Playing’ in pickup games on the
local streets, in the Keystone State
Games (at Penn State last month)
and in the Connie Hawkins League
will have to satisfy Bruce’s appetite

for basketball until the Lady Panth- '
ers begin practice on Oct. 1. She has ‘

learned a lot on those asphalt courts.
“The older‘ guys are really help-
ful,” Bruce continued. “They offer a
lot of advice, but when I beat some
of the younger ones to the boards,
they get kind of mad.” ‘
Even though Bruce holds ﬁve

school records, including most,

points in a season (666) and has a
good shot at becoming Pitt's first
female All-America in basketball,
she prefers to talk about team goals.

“We have a lot of talent on the
team this year,” Bruce noted. “We're
for the team and for each other.”

According to Dick Weiss of the
Philadelphia Daily News , “Pitt has
a legitimate All-American candidate
in Jennifer Bruce and could sur-‘
prise.” Bruce was cited as pre-season
high honorable mention‘ by the
Street & Smith, Basketball
Yearbook.

“Becoming an All-American is an
ultimate goal,” said a smiling Bruce,
who’s been named Big East Player of
the Year the last two years. “But
right now I’m concentrating on hav-
ing a winning season. We never
really thought about the numbers or
the records. If we win, the numbers
will take care of themselves.”

The Lady Panthers tasted the

 

goals are to win at least 20 -games,
increase attendance and win the Big
East Tournament.”

Pitt was favored to do just that
last season, but was thwarted by
tournament champion Seton Hall.

Playing basketball with the big
boys wasn’t the only thing keeping
Bruce busy. Working as a site moni-
tor for the city's summer lunch pro-
gram, she also frequented the weight
room on a weekly basis.

‘This is the first summer I’ve
worked out in the weight room,”
Bruce explained. “Last season I was
double-teamed a lot. I'm trying to
build up my strength so—I don’t col-
lapse and have to come out of the
game.”

Considering that she transferred
from Division I power Tennessee
(secondsin the nation last year) two
years ago and now plays for a peren-
nially strong power in the East, that
is unlikely.

(Christine Kyle is an intern in the
Pitt sports information ofﬁce.)

gennifer Bruce is Pitt's ace at forward.

Veteran Brian Casey, a‘ junior,
said, “The attitude of the team is a
lot better due to the change in the
coaching staff. Everything you need
for a team has gotten better."

Luxbacher’s biggest obstacle this
year will be to mesh together his
offense. “There is a lot of potential
for development amongst the team.
The players are receptive and are
adapting as well as they can,” Luxb-

'. acher said with a high degree of

optimism.
The team on a whole looks rather

" healthy and eager to start the season
