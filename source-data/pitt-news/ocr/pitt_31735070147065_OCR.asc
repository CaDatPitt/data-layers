With the third week of February fast
approaching, some students are won-
dering if the Collegiate Readership
Program, paid for by the Student Ac-
tivities Fee and scheduled to start in
late January, will ever ﬁnd its place on
campus.

Early last month, Student Govem-
ment Board President Molly Stieber
said that the readership program —
which  bring 300 copies of both
The NewYorkTimes and USATodayto
campus onweekdays—would rollout
sometimebefore February. Thisweek,
Stiebersaid shehasneceivedwordﬁom
administrators thatthe program should
bestartbyMonday. ’

“Everythingis readyto go, butun-
forulnately we are still waiting for an
approval from the University,” Stieber
said. “Kenyon [Bonner] will let me
know the moment the contract has
been approved.”

Bonner, directorof St11dentLife and
associate dean of students, conﬁrmed

and that the papers could hit stands
as early as Monday. He added that the

Career fair draws second big crowd

For The Pitt News

" Like many of the students who at-

tended the nontechnical day of the
Spring Career Fair yesterday, Pitt se-
nior Rachel Bachtel didn’t expectto see
any employers lookingfor students in
her ﬁeld of study.

“Well, I’m a history major, so 
you’re not goingto see asign forahis—
tory major wanted, but [general edu-
cation] has given me the writing and
communication skill that [employers]
are looking for,’7 Bachtel said.

' She added that she wouldn’t mind

less of where she is working.

Like many who attended that the
fair, held throughout the main ﬂoor
of the Union, Bachtel reported feeling
anxieties rangingfrom fears aboutthe
economy to being unsure about how
to dress. Despite these consternations
and others, hundreds of undergradu-
ate, graduate students andalumni net-
worked with the 87 employers who
attended the fair.

Including both the technical and
nontechnical days, 175 businesses
visited Pitt this week. That’s 25 more
thanlast year, and 30 of those 175 did

not attend inthe past. P '

attended yesterday’s event, likely be-
cause nontechnical careers cover a

. broader range of majors.

Finlay also said the employers were
not justlookingfor graduating seniors
seekingacareer. They also offered in-
ternships to underclassmen and pro-
vided an opportunity for students to
_consider careers that they might not
have previously associated with their
majors. '

Pitt graduate Linda Kelly could
serve as Pennsylvania’s next at-

Gov. Tom Corbett nominated
Kelly, but Kelly’s nomination
must be approved by the state
Senate. If approved, the federal
litigator who has spent more
than 30 years practicing in A1-
legheny County would become
the state’s top law enforcement
officer, overseeing civil and crim-
inal court responsibilities and
consumer protection. C

Corbett was the state’s attor-
ney general before he began his
term as governor earlier this year.
Kelly, who holds a bachelor’s de-
gree in English from Pitt, said she
was “honored” and “humbled” by
Corbett’s nomination.

Bruce Antkowiak, an associ-
ate professor of law at Duquesne

the 1980s as members of the Nar-

Antkowiak said Kelly’s reputatio

and thoughtful attorney. Her
judgment has never been brought

New regulations for college student health insurance

Gwenn Barney
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Like their private counterparts, Uni-
versity-provided health insurance
plans will be banned from denying
coverage to students with pre—exist-
ing conditions and imposing payout
limits starting next year.

The U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services announced yes-
terday a set of proposed rules that
will startin2o12. The new ruleswill
afford students the same consumer
protections and beneﬁts through
University—provided health insur-
ance that the general population

   

   
   
 
   

receives under the Affordable Care . . '

Act, whichwas‘signe_d in March. The
law also gives the government the

power to enact the rules for students

now. — .
Along with baring insurance

' companies from denying coverage A
to those with pre-existing health-

problems — such as diabetes, high
blood pressure, cancer and asthma
—— these protections include elimi-
nating situations where insurance
agencies only pay students health
beneﬁts up to a certain amount, ‘a

practice known as placing “lifetime

lirni ” on coverage. I . .
During a conference call, Steven

Bloom, director of government rela-

tions for the American Council on
Education, expressed concerns that
premiums. on student health care
plans could increase with the added
provisions. ‘' _ ‘

_“There’s concern insurers might
use the regulations as a pretext to
raise premiums,” Bloom said.

Steve Larsen,di_rector of the Cen-
ter for Consumer Information and
Insurance Oversight, the branch of

the HHS responsible for the provi- ‘

sions’ creation, addressed Bloom’s
concern. .
“We are not expecting the insur-

ance industry  will have to raise _

premiums,’_’ he said.

. Accordingto the HHS’s website, 0

approximately 1,500 to 2,000 insti-
tutions of higher education across
the counuy offer some type of health
coverage,with as many as 3 million

' students covered through student

health care systems.

.Pitt’s health coverage plan is
offered through the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center. Pitt and

UPMC officials did not immediately a

The proposed rules also will do

student ballot  
rights inalienable

iven how ingrained free

and open elections have

. become in our civic ver-

nacular, we commonly think of

our right to vote as an immutable
constant.. -

Almost 50,years since the Vot-

ing Rights Act of 1965, 21st—cen—

i tury American young people have

comfortably internalized the no-
tion that regardless of wealth,
race, belief or educational status
the ballot will always be free to
us to cast. ' _

Though considering legisla-
tion pending in the New Hamp-
shire state house, perhaps college
students have been naive.

Early last month, a Republican
New Hampshire state represen-
tative introduced a bill aimed at
barring college students from
voting in the towns in which they

" attend school. .
If the bill passes, students

will only be able to vote in their
college town if they lived there
before enrolling and can prove
an intention to stay.

According to its sponsor, Rep.
Gregory Sorg, the bill tries to al-
low only those with true com-
munity ties to influence elec-
tions. After introducing the bill
last month, he told the Boston

[9 Globe that, “It’s about making

sure that people who live in these
towns have some control over the
destiny of their towns.” . ‘
Sorg and his voting eligibil-
ity bill received significant ﬂack
from student political groups.

The Dartmouth, Dartmouth p

College’s student newspaper,

recently reported that the Col-‘ .

lege Democrat, Republican and
Libertarian student groups are
organizing a united front to

.. oppose the legislation. To the

groups, the bill represents a
scantily disguised attempt by
the new Republican majority in
New Hampshire to limit electoral
inﬂuence of traditionally left-

leaning college students.

In thejan. 26 article, President
of the Dartmouth College Demo-

' crats Jeremy Kaufmann said, “But
for some reason, just because sta- ‘

tistically students tend to vote

Democrat, that can somehow
remotely be [construed]; as jus-
tiﬁcation for this legislation. It’s
pretty staggering-.” - - ~
‘ Althoughthe bill’s passag

could potentially help his party,
the president of the College Re-
publicans, Richard Sunderland,
echoed Kaufmann’s concerns,
saying in the article,4“It doesn’t
matter Whether we’re liberal
or conservative — it just isn’t
right.” _ ’

Such bipartisan cooperation
among the Dartmouth student
political groups is essential at
this time, and we hope their ef-
fort to drum up popular condem-
nation for this legislation proves
successful.

This 'bill passing in New
Hampshire would be tragic, but
its emboldening effects on other
politicians seeking to limit the
collegiate voice could be much
worse. We can’t let this spread.

If you’ve read any of our edi-
torials, you already know that
emphasizing the importance that

_ universities have for their sur- ,

rounding community is part of
everyday, life at The Pitt News.
We have no problemsaying it
again. But this is not just an is-
sue of people under-appreciating
college students — it’s about the
future of our country. . ,
Every college student de-
serves‘ the right to electorally
inﬂuence his or her immediate

environment and‘ if that right is .

increasingly threatened, the fate
of American civic, participation
might be sealed. According to
Josiette White -—-the New Hamp-
shire director for America Votes
quoted in The Dartmouth article
—— said, “If people start voting’
at [a] young age, it becomes a
habit.” ‘ - 

Trying to hamper voting by

might make /short-term strategic
sense for the‘ GOP, especially as
2012 approaches. Bpt over the

Columnist

It’s notunusual for metouse the halfof
apage my editors grant me each week
to rip into Pittsburgh City Council’s
half-baked plans and mediocre legisla-

And I was about to do the same
- thingthisweek.‘Inthe midst ofﬁnan-
. cial.peril, struggles to keep jobs in the
city —- and the city governments con-
- stant inabilityto understand its young
constituents —— Council decided on
Tuesday to officially recognize a dog
— Xante, t_he golden retriever.

In discovering this, it became my
hope that Xante would perhaps be
nominated to replace Council Presi-
dent Darlene Harris. That would be
progress at least.

But unfortunately, we would have
noasuch luck. However, the canine
compatriot still deserves plenty of
recog11ition, perhaps even a good ear

scratching.

served as the paper’s spokesdog for
almost a year, integral in the paper’s

Xante was bred to be a Seeing Eye

surely be a bittersweet moment -

cessity, beneﬁting both the humans
and animals. I’m just waiting for a
letter from Westboro Baptist Church
disputing that.

Evolution has made sure we now
have helpers like Xante to assist those
who might never read this — since I
don’t believe The Pitt News publishes
an edition for the blind (unless theyfre
using a high-tech screen reader). Un-
fortunately, I haven’t heard of a See-
ing Eye dog that is ﬂuent in speaking

English, but after seeing the movie

“Up,” I don’t think the concept is too

far from reality.
Nonetheless — and perhaps most
signiﬁcantly illustrated by the Post-

Gazette’s chronicling of Xante’s story

— it’s clear that a dog can help not .

only those who have disabilities, but
also society in general.

Because admit it —— after the Su-
per Bowl lastweekend, you tuned into

the Puppy Bowl you saved on Tivo or ’
. DVRto make yourselffeel alittle better.

Either that or you viewed clips from

it after you got tired of watching the
commercial with Darth Vader’s Mini
Me starting a'Volkswagen with The
Force.

dently report that the ﬁrst halfof the
Puppy Bowlwasfarmore entertaining
thanthe ﬁrst halfofthe SteelersrPack-
ers game. And Puppy Bowl MVP Big
Red played abetter gametl1anBigBen
— not a tough task to accomplish.

According to The Washington
Post, more than 9.2 million people

tuned into the contest of canines last

year. That’s almost twice the number .

of people who watched the 2011 State
of the Union address.

What does this all mean? It means
that there’s anappeal for the altruistic
nature of do§.

It means that Xante should be
praisedforbeingthe caliber of dogthat
will likely commit the rest of his life
to serving others. It means Ardisson
should also receive commendation for
her work with helping the dog adjust

to life around humans.

And lastly, it means that City Coun-
cil deserves at least some recognition

“Before Edward ...” quips the
poster for Pittsburgh Ballet The-
atre’s upcoming Valentine’s Day
production, “there was Dracu-
la.”

Erin Halloran:

Between those two vampires
—— reminds Erin Halloran, a prin-
cipal dancer at the theater — are
countless other mythological be-
ings. . ‘ ,
“Vampires have been popu-
lar for a long time,” she said,
singling out Anne Rice’s famous

' “The Vampire Chronicles” as an

example.

The poster refers to Edward
Cullen, the vampire heartthrob
of the popular teen—bo0k series,
“Twilight.” V

People have always been fas-
cinated .with eternal life. Plus,
Halloran said, “There is some
sensuality in the whole idea of
being bitten.”

Halloran will play the role of
Svetlana in the‘ ballet theater’s
upcoming performance of Drac-
ula, based on the classic novel by
Bram Stoker. The ballet will fea-

ture music by German composer
Franz Liszt and choreography by
Ben Stevenson, who is the current
artistic director of Texas Ballet
Theater in Fort Worth.

When the story opens, Dracula
already has a retinue of wives.

Nonetheless, the promiscuous.

vampire is intent upon wooing
the peasant girl, Svetlana. She is
currently betrothed to another
man named Frederick. Dracula
attempts to seduce her through-
out the ballet.

The show will consist of three
acts and two intermissions. This
will be the company’s fourth per-
formance of “Dracula,” and the
third for artistic director Ter-
rence Orr. The Pittsburgh Ballet

Theatre’s last production of the

show was in 2004.
The ballet theater always tries
to present a ballet about love dur-

B ing Valentine’s Day weekend, Orr

said, and “[Dracula] is a story
about eternal love, in a way.” One
only has to look at his many wives
to realize that much.
The.theater’s principal dancer
Nurlan Abougaliev is excited to
play such a passionate and strong

_ character as Dracula. This season

is Abougaliev’s first as a principal
at the company, and he»acknowl—
edges the responsibility the sta-
tus commands. “When you’re a
principal, you need to work even
harder,” he said, because on stage

. you cannot get away with making

any mistakes. -
On nights when he is not per-
forming Dracula, Abougaliev will

be playing Svetlana’s ﬁance, Fred- V

This is the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s fourth production of the 10

MOVIE coLuMNl

‘Prankumentaries’ fool

audiences, critics question

Several proclaimed documentaries are suspect of being fake

, Andy Tybout
Assistant A8-E Editor

“Exit'Through the drift Shop,” one of this ',
year’s Oscar nominees for Best Docu—'

mentary, is an excellent film, rife with

humor, colorful characters and incisive
commentary. There’s just one problem: 

Many people thought-it‘was all a. hoax.

In fact, many people thought half
last year’s»“documentaries” were closeted "4

 

dramas —— scripted theatrics dressed up

as journalism. Frornrthe bemusing-“I’m
Still Here” to the enthralling “Catﬁsl_1,” 
the 2010 ﬁlm community was continually 2

mired in puzzling out which movies were
factual and which movies were, to bor-
row a phrase from The New York Times,
“prankumentaries.’.’

Accordingly, I’ve conceived of a new Os-
car title: “Best Ostensible Documentary.”

This is the award to bestow on ﬁlms audi- ,

ences were told were true, yet aroused an
alarming degree of critical skepticism. So,
without further ado, the best 4 or most
‘notorious —— ostensible documentaries
ofg2o_1o are  .

“Exit Through the Gift Shop”: As press
materials tell it,‘ “Exit” is the story of Thi-

erry Guetta, an ebullient,_dunde1-‘headed. 
' ‘Frenchman whose unlikely rapport with "
street artists lead him to Banksy, the re-

clusive, high-proﬁle British prankster.
Somewhat remarkably, the two men be-
come friends. But when Guetta d_ecides to
become a street artistﬁhimself, christening
himself Mr. Brainwash and mass—produc-
ing a vapid series of Warhol knock-offs,‘
Banksy feels obligated to endorse him.’
Unsettlingly enough, the endorsement and
the subsequent attention he receives from

alarge, eager crowd.’ ‘ V‘ .. '

If this film were true, it would be a re.-

vvealing portrait of street artists and their
admirers. But many critics are convinced 
the whole thing is a sham. "For one thing, it':.‘
would be entirely in cha-r_act.er‘for Banksy]
to make a documentary about a ruse he _.
played on the art world that was itself a‘;

 

 
  
 
    
     
     
     
      
       
     

ruse on the art world. More importantly,

perhaps, Mr. Brainwash seems too comi-

cally oblivious to be real.

Nevertheless, “Exit Through the .Gift V

Shop” has yet to be conclusively disproven
— hence the Oscar nomination. In both
instances, it’s a stimulating, subversive

' examination of the hype that sometimes

makes artists famous in spite of their art-
work. , A

 “1_’m Still ,Here’’: Sadly, the grotesque
“I’i_n StillHere” lacks the intellectual back-

,b.(.i;n,e that lande.df‘Exit” on several “year’s_‘
;jbes,ti’.’ lists. Originallybilled as a docu-
-> mentary about the trials of an unkempt,

dirnwitted Joaquin Phoenix who opts out
of acting for a career in hip-hop, the ﬁlm

‘is perhaps best described as a two—hour
~montage of failure: Phoenix rants obses-

sively, does drugs, orders hookers, has
his album rejected by Diddy and, most
unnecessarily, has his face defecated on.

At its best “I’m Still Here” gestures at
a rumination on celebrity identity, and
how the famous are devoured in the age

p of YouTube. Mostly, however, Phoenix’s ‘
deterioration seems self-imposed and

moreover, wholly without precedent.
Further diminishing the impact of “I’m

I _ Still Here” is the fact that it’s the only ad-

mitted mockurnentary on this list. What

inspired Phoenix and director Casey Af-

ﬂeck to carry out such an elaborate stunt

’fremains‘unclear. Ultimately I was almost

too underwhelmed to care. .

~“Catﬁsh’f: Fittingly, the third ﬁlm that
piqued critics’ skepticism this year was in
some ways an expose of Facebook — an
online arena where truth becomes warped
beyond recognition. The story goes as

. follows: A photographer begins receiv-

ing remarkably vivid paintings from an

V58-year—old named Abby. Impressed, he

Vampire drama made for duets

Dracula < 8
.\

erick. V
Having had the opportunity to perform

another version of “Dracula” before, Abou-

galiev said Stevenson’s version is notable

for its beautiful pas de deux’s, or duets, and

fantastic special effects. Those effects in-

"‘"clude ﬂying, pyrotechnics and characters

transforming into vampires on stage.

Halloran also praised the choreography
because it provides “great opportunities
for corps de ballet work.” The corps rep-
resents the ensemble of dancers that ac-
company the leads on stage.

The ballet theater has commissioned
Stevenson’s works before, including “Alice
In Wonderland” (1999) and “Cinderella”
(2oo2).

Orr said that Stevenson, who is typi-
cally a classical choreographer, is a mas-

terful storyteller, in life and in his profes-
sion. He introduces many nuances into
his choreography to reinforce any story
that he is telling. '

Like any adaptation, this reenactment
of the Dracula legend is sure to_ curtail
large segments of the original novel.

However, Orr said that such an event

is inevitable and sometimes even neces—‘

sary. _

' “There is always some artistic license.
You move [the story] a bit,‘ andtry to ﬁg-
ure out where your highs and lows are,”
he said.- _ '

Whether Edward will ever gain the ac-
claim to enter the annals of literary history
is improbable. Nonetheless, one thing is
clear —— Dracula is the reigning vampire
of posterity.

‘Catf1sh’s’ questionable

content keeps interest

Tybout < 9

befriends her and subsequently her entire
family on Facebook. Inevitably, he devel-
ops an attraction to Abby’s older sister,
whose proﬁle suggests a tall, attractive
blo nde with a burgeoning talent for guitar.
As is always the case with such relation-

ships, online correspondence soon seems
inadequate, and the photographer and
his ﬁlmmaker friends ‘set out to ﬁnd the
family. Needless to say, all is not what it
seems. , -
Without giving up any spoilers, many
commentators have faulted the ﬁlmmak-
ers for exploiting their subjects, and being
willfully credulous of certain transpar-
ent illusions. Others, like documentar-

ian Morgan Spurlock and comedian Zach
Galiﬁanakis, have proclaimed the ﬁlm an
outright hoax. Like “Exit Through the Gift
Shop,” however, “Catﬁsh’s” resonance is
hardly diminished by these accusations
—— on the contrary, the fog of truth only

 

renders it more intriguing.

And the winner is 

7‘Exit Through the Gift Shop”: Of course,
the only ﬁlm on this list that would beneﬁt
tenfold from being exposed as a hoax. As
a straight documentary, it’s amusing. As
a faux-documentary, it’s a fascinating ex-
-ercise in metaﬁction. Of course that’s just
my opinion — in criticism, as in cinema,
objective truthis hard to come by.

TRACK AND FIELDV

Lowery sets Pitt sprinting record

Junior turns in-best’500—'nieter event time in school history, looks to continue success as Panther as indoor season concludes 

~ - Courtesy Pitt Athletics
Pitt sprinterjermaine Lowery runs in a meet at Penn State last season.

Isaac Saul
Staﬂ” Writer

Pitt track star Jermaine Lowery
broke a school record last month
that stood for 11'years -— a feat

I that would thrill most runners.

Yet as his time of 1:02.82 in
the 500-meter race came up on
the boards, both he and his-coach
thought the same thing — he
could have been faster. T

“To betruthful, when he ran"

that 500 race he was basically

‘by himself. There was nobody
there to push him because he

separated himself from the field
at about 400 meters,” Pitt head.
coach Alonzo Webb said. 4“A lot of
times when someone is there you
give a little more effort — so he-
could actually run it faster, and-
I think he will.”

The record previously held by
Carl Taylor was 1;0-3.20 + nearly
four—tenths of ‘a second slower
than the time Lowery set — an

impressive time for anyone, let
alone having it mark a school
record.

“I was very excited, because
it’s a collegiate school record,”
said Lowery, a junior. “Only a
few people can break collegiate
school records, and when it was

Alonzo Webb:

“ . .. he could actually

teammates weren’t surprised by
Lowery’s run.

l “When I saw his workouts I
gave him — and the times I asked
him to hit — and he was exceed-

ing those, ‘I knew he was on the.

brink of something pretty spe-

set such a long time ago — I think
it was 2000 — that kind of just
solidiﬁed where my training has
been going this year.”

Lowery’s fastest time in the
500-meter run before his re-
cord-breaking run was 1:03.41.
Even so, Webb and some of his

“Definitely no surprise,” fel-
low sprinter and teammate Mi-
cah Murray said. “He’s one of the
hardest-working people on the
team, I was just waiting for it.”

“He is such.a positive inﬂuence on both
the men’s and women’s team,” Webb said.
“You can‘ feel the pulse of the team this
year. It is a lot more focused and hard-
working overall from top to bottom [than

in years past] .” .

“One thing about running career bests
is that they want to get another one,” Webb
said. “They motivate themselves, and they
know they put the work in — and now it’s
paying off for them.” , _

Lowery agrees that his hunger to suc-
ceed hasn’t gone anywhere since he broke
the record. He thinks it has helped moti-
vate the team. ‘ ~

“I think we have just as much of a
chance as any other team to win the Big
East,” Lowery said. ‘.‘We’ve been work-
ing really hard to get that goal, and it’s
attainable.” I ' - ‘ '

Big East basketball deserves its own regional bracket

Trietley 1 11

wins, embarrassing losses and
analyst banter by simply inviting
the. Big, East teams to the Tour-
nament. ’ _
.I_’m sure this is the fourth
time this week you’ve heard
some braggart heap praise ‘on
the conference —— and for that’,
I’m sorry. But the most entertain-
ing games this season,-with a few

' exceptions, have been in the Big

East. Let’s just put _,alll16 teams
in one region, haveit double as
the conference tournament and
put the ACC-Big Skygmatchup in
another region.  ’  *

Psitt-’s the:No.'*1 seed, and the
Panthers play No'.‘.16-se'ediDePaul

in my alternate-‘universe -mad-

ness. “Won.’t somebody think of

the mid-majors?” you ask.
~Well, the Blue Demons are ba-

sically as goodas ai mid-major

—a school that competes in a’

small Division I conference. They
have about the same resume as a
typical No. 16 seed, and,’hey, they
almost beat Louisville. So the real
mid-major automatic bids who
win their conference tournament

 

can go play on the other side of
the bracket.

In addition, if the Blue Demons
have afsolid showing on national
television, maybe a good recruit
will be watching and decide to

I give Notre Dame the No.
3 seed and a ﬁrst-round game
against No. 14—seed Rutgers. The
Fighting Irish play the “we should
be seeded higher, but we don’t

, care one way or the other, but we

No. 13 matchup. The Friars beat

the Cardinals last month, and

by also beating Villanova they
have a better track record than
most years’ No. 14 seeds. CBS, the
broadcast‘ home of the Tourna-

Pitt’s the No. 1 seed, and the Panthers 4
play No. 16-seedDePaul in my alternate-
umverse madness.  

inject life into the program. ‘

Villanova earns the No. 2 seed,
taking on South Florida in the
first round. ‘Now, South-Florida
isn’t very. good, but if I’m bring-
ing along 15 other Big East teams,
I might as well ‘take the Bulls as
well. . C

The Wildcats have a thing for
struggling as a No. 2 seed, so
maybe this matchup’s second-
half score will scare half of Phila-
delphia.

Te6rua1y12, 2011 mm
(Pitt vs. 91/laiyfcmcf  
Titzgerafd Tiefcfﬂfouse

should be seeded higher” card,
which has a tendency to back-
fire in the Tournament. Rutgers
epitomizes a No. 14 seed, pos-
sessing a young coach on the rise
and the team smarts to hang out
with more talented squads.

One warning: With both pro-
grams running a, shall we say,
patient offense, the ﬁnal score‘
could be a disappointing 31-25.

Louisville and Providence
meet in the intriguing No. 4 vs.

ecognitzbn  

merit, can prepare the revenge-
themed opening montage tomor-
row, with a big demonic-looking
cardinal making caw noises and
everything.

I’m giving Kemba Walker of
Connecticut the No. 5 seed so he
can play No. 12-seed Seton Hall
again. The Pirates just played
Walker last weekend", and they
led for most of the second half
—— until Walker, I’m told, passed
to himself and knocked down a

3-pointer. I’m givingjeremy If-Ia— .

zell a mulligan and letting the Pi-
rates have another shot at Walker
and the rest of the Connecticut
Walkers.

Syracuse is my No. 6 seecf:

and Georgetown is No. 7. That
leaves West Virginia, Cincinnati,
St.]ohn’s and Marquette. All four
programsdominate a ranked
team one night and a drop win-
nable game the next, so I’ll pull

. the seeds out of a hat —, I assume

at some point on Selection Sun-.
day the committee deems this a
suitable method, too.

The hat lottery yields the
following: Syracuse plays West

Virginia, Georgetown faces Mar-

quette, and St,John ’s plays Cin-
cinnati. 5

I’m hesitant to pick a winner
for any of these games. If the Big
East Conference has shown us
anything, it’s that anybody can
beat anybody on a given night
—— which makes it perfect for the
Tournament. I
