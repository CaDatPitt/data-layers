Market
Central  
adds new
allergen

labels

Michael Ringling
Staﬁ" Writer

An allergic reaction from a Pitt
student caused. S.odexo to in-
stitute a new labeling system
for food allergens at Market
Central. ‘

, Julia Noll, who is allergic to
all nuts andyshellfish, said that

after‘ eating macaroni noodles“

covered in a white sauce -at
Market Central on Sept. 10,
she found a baby shrimp in the
entree. Her tongue soon began
to swell, and she broke out in
hives. \ g ' . _

Noll said the food item was
not marked inany way and con-
tacted Sodexo about it. That
prompted Sodexo to implement
a new system: labeling foods
that contain ingredients that
are common allergens — even
when.it doesn’t look like the
food would contain them.

But Sodexo has not started
the new labeling program at
other Venues on campus, in-
cluding Schenley Cafe, the Ca-

thedral Cafe and the Taco Bell‘

location in Litchfield Towers.
Also, Sodexo’s website currently
includes information on aller-

about any of the other venues
on campus.

Workers placed the labels,
in the shape of stop signs, on
the glass panes above the food
in Market Central. The labels
are marked with illustrations
of nuts, wheat, tree nuts, eggs
and dairy products. Also, fli-
ers have been placed in every
napkin dispenser explaining the
allergen graphics.

Sodexo started the new la-
beling system in the past week,
less than two weeks after Noll
spoke with Susan Fukushima,
the resident district manager of
Sodexo Campus Dining, about
herallergic reaction.

“The system seems pretty
good if they keep up with it,”
Noll said regarding the new
labels.

Catherine Giancola, a biol-
ogy major with a pistachio al-
lergy, agreed that the labeling
system is a positive change.

“[Labeling] is the only smart
thing to do,” Giancola said. “I
don’t know if you .could expect
a place like this to do more than
they are doing now.”

On Sept. 22, Noll was invited

to tour“ Market Central to~ex— .

amine the new labeling system
with Fukushima, Operations
Director for Market Central

ljon Soulia and Executive Chef

Matt Mantini. Noll said that the
15-minute meeting gave the at-
tendees a new perspective on
the issue.

“Once I met with them, I
think that they acknowledged
it’s not just me,” Noll said, re-
ferring to people with food al-
lergies.

In the first email response
Fukushima sent to Noll, the
Sodexo manager said, “We will
add an allergen symbol for.
shellfish.” But as of Monday,
an allergen symbol for shellﬁsh
had not been included in the
labeling system.

In the nutrition facts for

turkey burgers, grits and oat-

.:?.z

meal, there is a small sign that
says, “contains fish,” and the
omelette bar ‘sign says, “may
contain shellﬁsh.” But there is
no stop-sign shaped shellfish
allergen label.

Noll also said that Market
Central officials offered to send
her emails with the daily menus,
although she hasn’t received
any yet.. But the company said
it was willing to accommodate
her needs further, she said.

“IfI continue to have prob-
lems, I could have special meals
for me,” Noll said. “But I don’t
want special meals for me. I’m
not anyone important. Ijust
want to eat like a normal stu-
dent.” _

Noll said that Sodexo also
urged her to ask the employees
what is in each meal.

“I accept the responsibility,
but it should also be labeled,”
Noll said. “If it looks like mac
and cheese, I’m not going to

. question it.”

‘Fukushima said that employ-.
. e_es also should have knowl-
' edge of the ingredients ofthe

meals. . »
“Our talented dining team

members also receive extensive‘

food safety tr_aining and are
constantly updated about the
meals we serve, so that they can
answer food—related questions,”
Fukushima said in an email.

Sodexo also offers other re-
sources for students to obtain
their food’s nutritional infor-
mation on a computer in Mar-
ket Central and on the campus
dining website.

University spokesman John
Fedele said in an email that if
a student has an allergic reac-
tion on campus, “[the] student
should seek appropriate medi-
cal attention for their specific
situation, whether that be tak-
ing an antihistamine or going
to a medical facility.”

Her last visit to Pitt was in 2006,

“I feel as though I am back home.
I am deeply grateful for the gift that
this institution gave me. I felt I was

InaWhite House release, President

as “an example to all of us to persist in
our pursuit of progress.”

“The work ofthe Green Belt Move-
ment stands as a testament to the
power of grassroots organizing, proof
that one person’s simple idea—— thata
community should come together to

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

Ruth Wangari. A

“The world has lost a power-

He said he couldn’t’give an estimate of

be a policy change, but I would like to change
the general mindset,” he said.

Still, as a member of the Arts.& Sciences
Undergraduate Council, a group made up of
ﬁve students and six faculty members who
review proposals for new courses and new
or revised instructional programs, he said he

often sees proposals come through for courses j

about which he spoke to department heads.
This semester, Pitt offers more than 750
courses that ﬁll general education require-
ments in the School of Arts 8: Sciences.
, Juan Manfredi, vice provost of undergradu-
ate studies in the School" of Arts 8: Sciences,

said that for a course qualify as a.gen—ed, its

professor must submitaproposal to theArts &
Sciences Undergraduate Council with a reason
forwhy the course should count as ﬁilﬁlling a
certain requirement. ' .

“Most of the proposals are approved,
even if it’s not alwaysthe ﬁrst time,” Man-
fredi said. ~ - .

He said that he sees a “spectrum” of univer-

. sities in regardsto policies on general educa-

tion requirements. Some schools require al-
most no general education courses, and others
are very gen—ed heavy. Mainfredi said Pitt tries
to take a middle-of-the-road approach.

The general education requirements for the ‘

School of Arts 8: Sciences include an introduc-
tory composition course, two writing-inten-
sive courses, a- quantitative reasoning course
and courses in literature, the arts, philosophy,

- social sciences, historical change, natural sci-
ences, foreign language, international culture ,

and non—Western culture, A

George Reid Andrews, the head of the histo-
ry department, said he supports Zimmerman’s
venture. He said his faculty seems to havebeen

‘ accepting of making more courses available

for general education requirements.

“It seemed reasonable to me for students
to have more choices when it came tofulﬁlling
these requirements,” Andrewssaid.

In some departments, there are issues of
resource allocation. Zimmerman saidthat

even though the political science department .

has been open to his ideas, they lack sufficient
faculty to open more courses for general edu-

A cation ﬁilﬁllment.

Andrews said that sometimes it simply
doesn’t occur to professors to open their
courses as general education classes. The

requirements were instated in the early

2000&

John Twyning, the associate dean of un-
dergraduate studies for the School of Arts
8: Sciences, said the course must be‘con—
sidered in relation to the rest of a subject’s
curriculum, which-only the department can
know. V’

However, Twyning has a positive attitude
towardZimmerman’s efforts.

interest in this. It’s good to have student

Bake sale avoids
larger issue

How do you launch a sweetly
innocuous bake sale to the na-
tional forefront?

Make it political.

The College Republicans at

‘the University of California,

Berkeley, ‘created a media mael-
strom when their plans to hold
an “Inc_rease Diversity Bake

Sale” on campus sparked na-»

tional controversy. According
to a Washington Post article,
the organizers said the event,
which will feature tiered pric-

ing based on ethnicity and gen-
der, is meant to satirize pend_-

ing state legislation that would

‘ “allow California universities to
‘consider race, gender, ethnic-

ity and national origin during
admissions.”
The price structure is set as

foll-ows: White students pay $2

for a baked good, Asian Ameri-
cans pay $1.50,’Latinos pay $1,
black students pay $0.75-and
Native Americans pay $0.25.
Being a woman will knock a
quarter off the price of each
baked good. I

The event’s organizers de-
fended their bake sale, calling it
asatire of affirmative action-
I “The Berkeley College Re-
publicans ﬁrmly believe mea-
suring any [applicant’s] merit
based on race is intrinsically
racist  The pricing structure
of the baked goods is meant to

be satirical, while urging stu-

dents to think more critically
about the implications of this
policy,” they wrote on the Fa-
cebook event page.

But this event does nothing
to urge students to think criti-

' cally about-anything. Instead,-

it’s a publicity stunt that drives
the focus away from the real is-
sue — the "American education
system — and onto the student
group itself. It’s a tired cha-
rade‘ of faux-political activism
that has happened almost every
year ——' according to Slate, uni-
versities across the U.S. have
done the exact same thing since
2002.. >

And_ what has been accom-

plished to deserve such media

attention? Nothing. Despite

years of affirmative action and

affirmative action-bashing bake
sales, little has loosened the
white man’s grasp on the world.
What’s at issue isn’t how much
a cupcake costs, it’s how much

‘ work our society needs to do to

become more egalitarian.
If the College Republicans

-at Berkeley are earnest about

changing this legislation, they
should implement a new strate-
gy that serves not as hackneyed

satire, but as a true solution to.

the problem.

We think affirmative action ‘

isn’t the solution to unequal
distribution. of opportunity.
It’s an inequality-fraught class
system, not necessarily race or
gender, that limits peoples’ op-

‘ portunities. . ,
Why should higher education '
"determine acceptance based on

appearance?
We need a new solution, not
a tired, perennial stunt.

Think we're crazy?

"NOT BROUGHT TOAYQU BY SEARS

Matt Schaff
Columnist

Can inanities make it into col-
lege newspapers? Let’s experi-
ment... ‘

I hate washing dishes. Of all
typical things that overwhelm
college students with a longing
for home —— realizing that Mom’s
purse no longer functions as a
suitable method of money collec-
tion, that soccer-ball-bespeck-
led minivans don’t park outside
house parties to take. us home,

etc. — my crippling nostalgia in_— _

volves plates, soap and sponges.
My parents had a dishwasher, and
boy, were those the days.

As a modern individual taught
by my surroundings to value effi-
ciency and moisturized cuticles,
having to wash dishes by hand
is the worst. You might relate,
especially if yousimilarly rent
one of 0akland’s state ofthe art,

circa 19th-century off-campus

apartments.

Some people call dishwashing
“relaxing,” but in my view, that’s
somewhat off. Staging heated
(literally) battles with last week’s
caked—on pasta sauce — which
might be yours or your room-
mates’, depending on your apart-
ment dynamic — has a low prob-
ability of producing emotionally
healthy college students.

Dishwashing woes go beyond
the wrinkled ﬁngers of frustra-
tion.’Most importantly, students
tend to prefer other activities
than putting a sponge to a plate.
Washing dishes s_ucks time out of
your schedule faster than your
drain will suck down food par-
ticles and clog your pipes. Think
of all of the wonderful things we
could do with the time that we
throw at the piles of dishes in
our collective sinks: having social
lives, passing classes, volunteer-

ing in Darfur, capping carbon
dioxide emissions. What’s clear
from this analysis is that wide-
spread washing of dishes puts a
damper on societal potential — a
plug, if you will. . -

Hence, the obvious need for
a “Mechanized Dishwasher Ap-
preciation Day” at Pitt.

But wait —— handwashing
dishes never killed anybody (yes,
I Googled it). And ifl really felt
threatened, I could always type
“dishwasher” into Craigslist’s

apartments page. In fact, you’re .

probably asking this: What drives
me to take up space in a reputed
newspaper for what on the sur-
face seems like partially hydro-
genated bibble-babble?

After all, it seems that I’ve de-
cided to devote my hard—won.edi—

. torial skills to a piece about my

personal dishwashing qualms,
while issues far more relevant

and inﬂuential in the lives of
Pitt students lie a-festering.(For
example, you might expect me
to talk about these things: the
military’s ofﬁcial repeal of Don’t
Ask Don’t Tell, the government’s
overdue addressing of tax loop-
holes, the upcoming verdict for
the Irvine’11 free speech case).
Somehow, I’ve passed on these
other, journalist-worthy topics in
favor of a petty and self—absorbed
rant about a household chore. But
readers, have no fear — there’s
indubitable worth in this column,
especially after considering your
likely armchair speculations:

First, it’s possible I was trying
to be funny. Maybe you could re-
late to the trials of dishwashing,
and in such a case you could be
receptive to amateur attempts
at wiggling your giggle box. But
that’s probably not it.

A more likely scenario is
ulterior motive, which should
never be ruled out of any hon-
est discourse. Cynics among you
will invariably come to the cor-
ruption conclusion, that either
Sears or Kenmore has slipped me
stacks of Benjamins to put these
words in print. “Glenn Beck and
Goldline made it work, why can’t
Matt Schaff?” you might ask. And
there you’d have an unshakable
point.

It could also be blackmail. By
deﬁnition, apublic ﬁgure of my

stature almost surely has some .l

damaging pictures, illegitimate
children or blood diamonds
stashed on a Caribbean island
somewhere —— maybe a dis-
gruntled former coworker has
acquired them and now wants to
use The Pitt News to take sweet

revenge.
Or maybe it’s political. Every-

thing is these days, of course.’

Maybe I’m using playful anec-
dote to distract voters, thereby
preventing Wisconsin’s U.S. Rep.
Paul Ryan’s dreamy blue, tractor-
beam eyes from selling the inter-
ests of America’s corporations to
throngs of my unassuming colle-
giate compatriots. Or, more obvi-
ously, I could be making the way
for the next dark horse Student
Government Board candidate
—— of my prior selection —— who
plans to run on a dishwashers-
for-all slate. Karl Rove might
say my editorial support con—
fers endless political utility ——
indeed, you can’t say for certain
the “Architect” himself isn’t my
SGB candidate of choice.

In the end, when your spec-
ulation vortex stops spinning,
there’s always the most unlikely
of contingencies: that for some
reason I didn’t put forth enough
courage, effort or time to tackle
a challenging op—ed, one with any
chance of addressing a real issue
that affects real people (on cam-
pus or not). But that couldn’t_be
the explanation — columnists,
by definition, produce worth-
while work on a weekly basis.

Although if readers neverthe-
less attack my work with charges
of “inanity,” I could always blame

it on my lack of adishwasher. _ .

GOING MENTAL

Getting Help Part 1: Advent

Concerned about your well-being? Seek a professional second opinion

Tracey Hickey »

For The Pitt News

It’s a nearly universal consensus that
if you are struggling with mental ill-
ness, you ought to “get help.” What’s
not so well understood is the stagger-
ing amount of effort it can take to get
from Point A -- reading the Counsel-
ingCenter’s phone number ona“Talk
About It” ﬂier —- to Point B: making
an appointment.

Mental health concerns, particu-
larly depression, have recently gotten
alot of press at Pitt. Depression made
the front page of The Pitt News just
last week, and there’s been a wide-
spread push to increase awareness of
the resources Pitt offers for suffering
students. But the students who need
this encouragement the most are of-
ten the hardest to reach. Ifyou’re hav-
ing mental health troubles, you might
think you don’t have the time to ad-
dress them, or that you should be
strong enough to powerthrough. You
might think that therapy is hogvvash
or worry that you’ll bepressured into
taking medication. '

Full disclosure: I was diagnosed
with clinical depression the summer
after my freshman year, although
it was estimated I’d been depressed
since early high school. My pretreat-
ment years were peppered with un-
successful, hesitant and plainly half-
assed attempts to reach out for help.
I had — both alternately and sirnul—
taneously — convinced myself that
A) Nothing was wrong withgme, B)
Taking advantage of the Counseling
Center would be diverting resources
from people who really needed them,
and C) I wouldn’t feel depressed ifI
could just stop being such aworthless
human being.

Unsurprisingly, none of these
convictions brought me much solace
— but they did prevent me from get-
ting help until it was well—past urgent.
And if these thoughts sounded a little
too  to you, then you might
want to read this closely.

If you thinkyou could be ‘suffering
from mental illness, you’ll probably

do the same thing youdid when you -
thought you had Mono —- that is, ﬁnd if

the Wikipedia page for the illness in

question and read all the symptoms, '

checking off which ones apply to you.

This is a perfectly valid ﬁrst step,
and it can be helpful in compiling a
list of concerns to bring to your ﬁrst
appointment. .

What you should not do is use the
Internet to diagnose or disqualify
yourself without talking to a profes-
sionaL A V

If you’ve ever gone fromhaving a
headache to thinkingyou have abrain
tumor after five minutes on WebMD,
avoiding, self-diagnoses based on
Internet research will be pretty self-
explanatory to you. However, most
people suffering from mental illness
have the opposite problem. It’s easy
to read the symptoms on the Na-
tional Institute for Mental Health’s
website and think, “I had fun at my
friend’s birthday party last Friday, so
I can’t be depressed,” or, “My manic
episodes aren’t that crazy, so I guess
I’rn not bipolar.”

Before I got treatment, I believed
that my. panic attacks weren’t panic

- attacks because‘ I’d never had heart

palpitations or fainted. This is ludi-
crous, but common. Don’t let it hap-
pentoyou. ~

The best advice I can give you?
Trust your gut. Ifyou have symptoms

~— no matter how frequently or con— .

sistently -— be sure to be in tune with

yourself and your “normal moods.”
If you’re suffering, nothing else mat-
ters —- that suffering is valid and you
deserve help.~ ‘  '
Even ifyou thinkyour depression,
anxiety or other problem might be
siuiational — exam stress, home-

sickness or the transition problems

cited as the reason that the Counsel-
ing Center is so busy at the beginning
of each academic year — -it cannot
hurt to make the appointment. The

Counseling Center will never make‘ C
you sign a contract committing to a .

year’s worth of therapy. If yougo infor
help during a stressful period‘ in your
life and after afew weeks or months it

doesn’t feel necessary anymore, con— ,
. gratulations: You’re free to go! Wasn’t .

thateasy? »

‘If you’re still waﬂling, look at it

this way: I’ve never heard a person
who had a brief stint with a therapist
and then decided they didn’t need it
say, “Man, I wish I hadn’t made that
appointment and had those three

counseling sessions.” But people who ‘

talkthemselves out of getting the help
they need always say, once in treat-

ment, that they regret not reaching"

out sooner. I certainly do. You can
lessenthis regret for yourselfby trust-
ing your gut, taking the leap of faith
and making the appointment now —_
before you change your mind. ,

If you have no idea what to expect
once you get to the Counseling Center
— you don’t know what you’re look-
ing to gethout of therapy or what you’d
even say to your counselor, or you’ve
had bad experiences with counsel-
ing in the past — I’m way ahead of
you. “Getting Help Part 2” will focus
on counseling —— what you owe your
therapist and what your therapist
owes you. I

" .. . .  gath-
eringtheirbelongmgs and searching
for the nearest exit. What began as
a song designed to engage fans and
excite the Pantherfootball team with
unanimous chants of “Let’s go Pitt!”
has become the signal for the not-so-
high-octane student section to clear
out and head home. _
By the time the middle of the
fourth quarter came around, you
probably could have counted the
number of fans left in the yellow
seats near Pitt’s end zone pretty-
quickly. In fact, counting all the re-

 

A maining Panther fans in the stadium

probably wouldn’t have provided
that much of a challengeeither.
As I sat and watched the small

number of students that stayed for-
’ the game’s entirety attempt to create

some semblance of an atmosphere,
I started thinking. Why get up early
in the morning, take a bus to Heinz
Field to tailgate and then leave at
halftime or right after Neil Diamond’s
voice serenades the crowd‘?

I’ve heard students mention the
Pitt shuttle system. They say it takes
too long to ﬁnd a bus at the end of
the game, and then by the time they
arrive back in Oakland, it’s too late to
do anything else that night. Against
Buffalo, students’ most common
excuse was that it was too hot, and
they’d been tailgating all day.

 
   

     

bother  . thth

Pittshuttle system or sitting outside

in the heat all day. I could do that
at home and I wouldn’t have to buy
the $25 Pitt season—ticket package
to do it. - .

So that made me wonder: What
makes some students stay until the
clock hits zero ‘and the Pitt football
team comes over to salute the stu-
dent section —. which, by the way,
looks pretty silly when there are only
10 people hanging around — and
others worry more about getting

, back to campus‘?

I asked Spencer Foster, a soci-
ology graduate student at Pitt who
taught Sociology of Sports, if there
are different levels of sports fans.
His answer? There are six, although
there is overlap between the levels
and the sixth level doesn’t apply
often. - '

The second level of Foster’s
breakdown, “patriots,” often applies
to Pittsburgh sports fans. Patriots
enjoy sports both on the national
level and at the local level. This fan-
dom often extends beyond family
and friends into social networking.
Pa/triots, Foster said, consume sports
information such as statistics and
history.

Uber—fans — not an official cat-
egory — tend to have obsessive per-
sonalities, he added, and can spout
sports information at a mo-
ment’s notice. Accountants and
engineers tend to have this

“focus on minutiae,” which
often makes them the most
passionate fans.
Take _].D. Schroeder,
a senior mechanical engi-
neering major at Pitt, who
often spends time in the stu-
. dent section tweetingavid Pitt
fans on the social-networking
site.
For Schroeder and fans like

‘the way othe en  

him, .it’s more about the game

a  33’
hard and people wonder why they
struggle a little bit. Maybe they think
the fans aren’t behind them.”

V While Schroeder admits that
“Sweet.Caroline” is one of the most
fun aspects of the game-day atmo-
sphere at Pitt, he grows frustrated
when students stream toward the
exits at the ﬁnal note.

Foster compared the game-day V

experience to sex, with the stages of
anticipation, foreplay, intercourse,

orgasm, cuddling and pillow talk. '

A game day starts with tailgat-
ing, then pre-game experiences and
then the “ﬁnal rush’-’ at the end of
the game, whether it’s a last-minute,
exciting win or burning seconds off
the clock. After the game ends, fans
often spend time reliving and dis-
cussing the game. ‘

Pitt fans, it seems, are leaving
before the climax.

Schroeder said that the problems
in the student section seem to be a
combination of impatience and not
understanding the game. Pitt fans
entered the season expecting new
head coach Todd Graham’s high-
octane offense to immediately put
up 50 or more points each game.

What Schroeder, and other fans
who study the game, tend to un-
derstand is‘ that there is a learning
curve for understanding a new sys-
tem. What the booing and early-exit
fans can’t seem to comprehend is
how much of a change the team is
going through, and that these things
generally take time.

' In comparison to the atmosphere
at Heinz Field, look at that of a game
like the thriller between Michigan
and Notre Dame. Michigan fans had
to be practically forced out of the
stadium after the contest came to
an end. That’s an atmosphere that
Pitt doesn’t have — mostly because
there aren’t enough people who care

Despite generally low attendance in the fourth quarter, some fans

remain extremely dedicated to Pitt football. These uber—fans often

Written By Larissa Gula

A double major in the business
school, 18-credits this semester,
ajob as an RA —— Pitt student
Leanne Ikeda is busy. But every
week, she ﬁts exercise into her
routine.

“I plan exercise,” Ikeda said,
explaining that she heads out to
the gym every other day when
possible. “It’s an important part
of my routine for me, because
it’s time just for myself. I try

To stave off college weight gain,
it’s crucial to maintain a balanced
diet and avoid the temptations to
over eat at buffet-style dining ar-
eas and 24-hour establishments.
It’s tough to squeeze in time to
work out — and the U.S. Center
for Disease Control recommends
two and a half hours per week.
Marian Vanek, director of
Pitt"s Student Health Service,
encourages all students to

to work out at least every other
day.”

Ikeda is only one of Pitt’s more
than 17,000 undergraduate stu-
dents trying to find time to live a
healthy lifestyle while at college.
Fortunately, Pitt provides numer-
ous resources to help students
ensure their regular routines are
actually healthy and effective.

The two habits required for

staying healthy, eating right and.

staying active, prove to be espe-
cially challenging for students.

exercise, even if they can’t do so
very often.

“Research has shown that as
little as 15 minutes of moderate

‘ intensity exercise per day may

reduce mortality risk,” Vanek
said in an email. She added that
any exercise encourages healthy
hearts, stronger bones, more
energy, and better immune sys-
tems, and that too few people
exercise even a little bit on a
weekly basis.

And exercising doesn’t need

to be limited to Pitt’s multiple
gyms, and recreation centers,
Vanek said.

“Brisk walking, jogging and .

swimming are ways to boost your
heart rate,” she said.

Take studentjennie Snyder 4
a senior double majoring in Span-

ish and communication — who’s

also taking 18 credits in addition
to her other responsibilities in
campus organizations.

Snyder exercises four or five
days every week. She can be
found either using the treadmill
at one of Pitt’s gyms or jogging
in the park or up to Shadyside or
Squirrel Hill.

By exercising, these Pitt stu--

dents are also doing more than
taking care of themselves physi-
cally: They’re all getting a great
mental—health boost as well, ac-
cording to Vanek. -

“Exercise  affects the brain;
it encourages a good mood and
reduces stress hormones in our
bodies,” Vanek said. “Research
teams have found that exercise‘
has been shown to improve
memory, attention and decision-
making abilities — especially im-
portant to the college student.”

Exercise also helps keep
weight in check. Researchers at
Oregon State University found
that a quarter of students gain at
least five pounds over the course
of two months early in their ﬁrst
year of college.

But exercise isn’t the only
component to healthy living —

Despite vitamins being a multibillion dollar industry, they are not a
- panacea and should be supplemented with healthy eating.

eating right factors in as well.

Snyder eats “as many fruits
and vegetables as possible”
during the day. She even eats a
larger, well—balanced breakfast
with protein, fruit and dairy
products. And she avoids late-
night snacking.

Ikeda has taken healthy eating
further. She recently made the
decision to see Meg Mayer—Costa,
the nutritionist at the Student
Health Service. She hopes to
take her healthy living one step
further by following a healthier
eating regimen. ,

“It’s tough on a meal plan,”
she "said about healthy eating.
“The options aren’t as Wide-
spread.”

When students visit Student

Health to meet Mayer—Costa, ap-
pointments begin with certain
questions about their living sit-
uations, weights, supplements,
medications and daily diets.
Because every student is differ-
ent, each has to be approached
differently when developing a
healthy-living plan, Mayer-S Costa

‘explained.

What might work for Ikeda’s
healthy lifestyle might not work

- for another student. And by go-

ing intothe nutrition center,
students can learn about what’s
helpful for them.

For example, although Ikeda
doesn’t use them, Snyder takes

Snyder contributes to a'$25 billion
business in the U.S. by taking these vi-
tamin supplements. Unfortunately, it’s
a myth that vitamins can cure illnesses
or make up for a poor diet. Recent stud-
ies released by the Archives of Internal
Medicine have shown that multivitamin
use does not give us the healthy boost we
once thought. _

Although Mayer-Costa said that mul-
tivitamins might provide a “safety net”
by adding small amounts of necessary
nutrition to a daily diet, the pills cannot
make up for a poor diet.

And she said doctors don’t prescribe
them to treat a disease because taking
Vitamin C during cold season isn’t going
to cure those sniffles faster.

Plus, multivitamins and the medica-
tions individuals take don’t always mix
well, so everyone should consult their doc-
tors about taking multivitamins in relation

to their health needs, Mayer-Costa said.

“Students  can take too much, too
often, and [the supplements] can also in-
terfere with each other and other medi-
cations,” Mayer-Costa said. This is why
vitamin pills come in low dosages that
are supposed to be taken once or twice
a day. . '

Ikeda and Snyder keep in touch with
their respective doctors and visit ‘every
year or two to make sure nothing is wrong
with their physical health. They agreed
that Wikipedia and WebMD ‘aren’t sub-
stitutes for taking care of yourself. And
thanks to their efforts and doctor’s visits,

The best way to determine a great per- l

sulting a doctor and seeing what works
best for the individual, Mayer-Costa said.

mend sound work-out routines in addition
to nutritional advice. I

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

about move toACC

Jon Anzur
Stajf Writer

Editors Note: Although most of the
media attention since Pitt announced
its move to theACC has focused on how
the conference changewill affect men’s

basketball and football, almost all of _

the sports on campus will make the
switch as well. This is ﬁrst in a series
ofreports ThePittNewswill do on the
conference switch, so check back this '
weekas ThePittNews gets the perspec-
tive of all the University’s teams.

At ﬁrst, Pitt women’s basketball V

player Ashlee Andersonwas surprised
— shocked, even — to hear that her
school decided to leave the Big East
for the Atlantic Coast Conference. Af-
ter all, the redshirt sophomore guard
came to Pitt expecting to spend her
college career competing in the Big
East. ~

“I was surprised at ﬁrst,”. Ander-
son, who appeared in every game for
the Panthers last season, said. “My
teammates and I committed to play
Big East basketball.”

Pitthead coachAgnus Berenatowas
also surprisedwhen she ﬁrstleamed of
Pitt’s defection, but she added the style
ofplay doesn’tvary muchbetween the
ACC and the Big East.

’ “Basketball is basketball,” she
said. A ‘

Both the ACC and the Big East are

home to some of the best teams in the ‘

nation. At the end of last season, six
ACC teams were ranked inthe Top 25;
ﬁve were ranked from the Big East. But
the Big East produced more national
champions inrecenthistory, with Con-
necﬁctittaldnghome the title six times
in the past 11 years and Notre Dame
winning in 2001.

pion from the ACC, won in 2006. 1

everywhere else is far. There’s goingto

Soon after hearingthe news about

Pitt’s move to the ACC.

the move, Anderson began to under-
stand Pitt’s decision. Teams all across
the nation were switching confer-
ences; it only made sense that Pitt
would too.

“One ofthe main things was try-
ing to ﬁgure out why we were moving
conferences,” she said. “Once I started
understanding why things were hap-
pening ‘and seeing that a lot of teams
aretryingto leave the Big East, it made
sense.” i ’

And her uneasiness gave way to
excitement.

A GRAIN or SAUL

NFL season already
full of oddities

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

This NFL season has been an
anomaly, to say the least.

After three weeks offootball,
there are three NFL teams at
3-0: the Bills, the Lions and the
Packers. No, you didn’t read that
wrong. That list doesn’t include
the Redskins, ‘who are 2-0 head-
ing into a Monday night show-
down with the Cowboys.

Aside from the Packers, who
won the Super Bowl last year
with half their team on Injured
Reserve, that group is pretty
surprising considering none

t l of the other teams were in the

playoffs '—— or even in the playoff
race — last season.

Not impressed? How about
the Eagles, Colts and Vikings
sitting at the bottom of their di-
visions‘? How about how Peyton
Manning, Terrell Owens, Brett

 , Favre and Randy Moss haven’t

played in a NFL game so far this
season? Even with those players
out of the mix, NFL teams scored
172 touchdowns in the opening
two weeks of the season —— the
most ever in NFL history.
Every six to 10 years there
seems to be a serious power shift
in the league, and we might be

‘ seeing that shift take place right

now. No longer are the Colts,
Steelers and Patriots sure bets
week in and week out. This Sun-
day proved that the tides are
turning: Tom Brady threw four
interceptions in a loss to the
Bills — he threw only four in-
terceptions all oflast season.

With that in mind, here are
some probable outlooks for un-
defeated teams, defeated teams
and fantasy disappointments.

Undefeated teams: Of the
four teams still without a loss,
the Packers are the only team
that will hold on for any length
of time.

Washington could easily be
2-1 by the time you read this

article. A loss to the Cowboys
on Mondaylnight would be no
surprise considering how incon-
sistent the two of these teams
have been in the past. The Bills
have come back from larger
than 18-point deficits in the
last two weeks, a pace no team
can expect to keep up. They will
also see the Eagles, Giants and
Redskins in the coming weeks.
The Lions look impressive so
far, but the Bears, 49ers and Fal-

cons could‘ all pose problems

for them in the coming weeks.

Note: Calvinjohnson looks abso-
lutely unstoppable, and whether
or not the numbers support it —
and they do, since he’s up there
in yards and leads the league in

touchdowns --Johnson is sim- ‘

ply not coverable.

The Packers are the champs,
and look like the champs, and
I’m not going to say otherwise
until somebody finds a way to
stop them. ~

Defeated teams: The Colts’
season is over. Good fight
against the hometown Steel-
ers, but good riddance to any
playoff aspirations. I"ll be pull-

ing for Peyton Manning in the

2012 season.

The Chiefs are last in points
and 3o“‘ in yards so far this sea-
son, and things aren’t going to
get any better. Losing Jamaal
Charles for the season was ab-

solutely devastating —- almost 

as devastating as the Colts los-
ing Manning. Seriously, this
guy was a freak last year, and
the entire offense ran through
him. Unfortunately, he’s gone,

and so is any hope that fans of 

Kansas City will have some-
thing to root for this year.

Note: Pitt alum Jonathan Bald-
win has yet to see the field since
injuring his hand in, a locker
room fight during the pre-
season. It was reported he ran
some routes in pre-game this

WOMEN'S SOCCER

Panthers held scoreless
in weekend’s games

Jon Anzur
Staffwriter

When the Pitt women’s soccer team faced off
against Seton Hall on Sunday, it marked the ﬁrst
college matchup between Panther midﬁelder
Katie Ruhe and her younger sister, Amie. It
took some of the sting out of the 3-0 loss for
the Pitt senior.

“Actually, at one point in the game she got
hurt,” Katie Ruhe said. “Our goalkeeper [Kris-
tina Rioux] is my roommate, so she knows my
sister well, but she actually took my sister out
a little bit. [Amie] was down,,so I ran from our
team over to where she was to help her up  She
had a charley horse, so I stretched her leg out
and allthat. Itwas ﬁm. Itwas anice little battle.
She knew betterthanto talk trash afterwards.”
Despite enjoying the game against her sister’s
team, Ruhe, and the rest of the Panthers, ended
the weekend without scoring in either of their
two games. ,' '

Pitt battled Rutgers to a scoreless tie on
Fridaynight before dropping the decision to
Seton Hall on Sunday. The Panthers (1-7-4,
0-2-2) have yet to win a game against a Big
East opponent. ‘

If the Panthers hope to turn things around,

A they need to ﬁgure out how to put the ball in the

net. They’ve been outscored 28-7 this year —— a

disadvantage of 0.58 to2.33 goals per game.
“We’re at a point right now where we can’t

ﬁnish our chances,” Ruhe said after Sunday’s

loss. “Until we can, our record’s not going to V

change. We’re not going to win games until we
start putting the ball away.”

Pitt’s defense kept the team in the game on
Friday night. Pitt goalkeeper Kristina Rioux
made ﬁve saves en route to her ﬁrst individual
shutout of the season.

“To get this shutout, itwas something we’ve
needed for the past couple of games,” head
coach Sue—Moy Chin said after Friday’s game.

-a~

 

“I couldn’t be more pleased with the team
defense. I thought our goalkeeper, Kristina,
had an outstanding game. But we’ve got to put
chances away.”

The Scarlet Knights outshot their hosts 17-
11, and the Panthers mustered just one shot
on goal. Pitt’s closest scoring attempt came
with 10:36 left in the second half._]unior Ashley
Cuba — who leads the Panthers with four goals
this season — beat diving Rutgers goalie Emmy
Simpkins, but the balldrilled the left post and
bounced out of bounds.

“It was a brilliant shot,” Chin said. “I thought
it was going in. Butwe’ve got to put those chanc—
es away. We had opportunities, we had shots,
we just weren’t getting them on frame. It’s those
little things that make a big difference. That’s
deﬁnitely going to continue. to be our focus
going forward.”

“We are building momentum,” she added.
“We’ve been playing much, much better the last
three games that we’ve played —- all Big East
games. Every game, we’ve been better. We still
need that productivity from our forwards, and
that’s the ﬁnal missing piece.”

Cuba said after Friday’s game that she
thought her team played “fairly well” against
the Scarlet Knights (6—3—1, 1-1-1), but that the
Panthers need to ﬁnish.

That didn’t happen on Sunday.

Seton Hall barely outshot Pitt —— 13-12 —— yet
was able to sneak three past Rioux to secure the
victory. Taylor Wilson, Katie Ritter and Caitlyn
Milazzo scored for the Pirates, who improved to
7-2-2 on the season and 3-1 in the Big East.

Despite the loss, Ruhe said she didn’t think
her team was regressing. .

“I don’t think we took a step back,” she said

. after the game. “Our defense played well and

our offense played how they’ve been playingall
season. I think they outplayed us offensively,
obviously, because we couldn’t ﬁnish anything.
We couldn’t put our opportunities on goal and

their defenders were’ able to clear stuff out. It p
just didn’t work out for us today.” I

week, but don’t expect him to be a factor
anytime soon. '

The winless Dolphins, Vikings and
Rams are no surprise. None of these teams
have anything close to a game-winning

formula. If I had to pick one to get over ,

the hump ﬁrst, it’d be the Vikings. With
Donovan McNabb and Adrian Peterson,
I wouldn’t expect these guys to make it
past week six without getting a win.
Honorary mention: The Philadel-
phia Eagles. For a “dream team,” this is
looking pretty nightmarish. Good news

came from camp today that Michael’

risky. Yes, I know Tom Brady spreads the
ball out. Yes, I know many people said not
to buy into him being a big part of the
offense. But still: This is disappointing.
Ochocinco has done close to nothing, and
for how successful Brady and Moss were
as a combo, I thought they’d at least have
hooked up for a touchdown by now. He
dropped a sure-touchdown in Sunday’s
loss to the Bills —— something I never
thought I’d see.’ '

‘Chris Johnson —— In my league, he has I

11.4 points so far this season. He has 98
yards on the season and no touchdowns.

, The winless Dolphins, Vikings and
  Rams are no surprise. None of these
  teams have anything close to a
game-winning formula.

Vick’s “broken hand” was actually a blood
vessel popped on the X—ray, something
head coach Andy Reid said was common,
although it seems like nobody has ever

. heard of .it happening before. The diag-

nosis is a bruised hand, but Vick is still
questionable for nextAweek.‘"He’s tough
as nails, so I’d expect him to play — but
a concussion and what we’ll call a “near-
fracture”_in his non—throwing hand is
noway to start the season forthe $100
million man. . _ _ .
Oh, and don’t think I didn’t see Vic-
tor Cruz punk Nnamdi Asomugha in the
end zone on Sunday. For being the most
valued free agent of the summer, Aso-

_ mugha hasn’t done much to back up the
five-year, $60 million contract the Eagles 4

gave him. Don’t forget that this was the
first time the Giants beat the Eagles in
seven tries, either. 0

Fantasy Disappointments: -

Michael Vick — Last year, Vick was
breaking down fantasy pointbarriers
and records left and ri'ght.,So I guess
the only place he could go was down. But
still, I took the bait and drafted him in my
league even though he hasn’t resembled
a team MVP. ’ ,

Chad Ochocinco — Yes, I know this was

s 99 0

He doesn’t even look like a starting run-
ning back. I drafted him thinking he’d
be a sure thing, but after Manning went
down I had to trade him away for Philip
Rivers —_ and I’m glad I did. The first
week was a fluke, the second week was
a mystery, but the third week is consis-
tent. I wouldn’t be surprised if he got
it going later on in the season, but no
matter what he does from here on out,
he was a letdown. I

Berenato: Move to ACC V
vvon’t affect recruiting

Basketball 4 11

“The ACC is one of me best conferences, so
I’m happy about the move,” she said.

Like Anderson, Berenato said such a move
was inevitable in today’s ever-changing world
of college athletics.

“Iwas surprised atthetimingofit,”Berenato

‘said. “But I was not surprised that we moved.

There was great discussion going on now for
eight months probably. So I knew something
was going to happen — but I was shocked when
it actually did. I give Chancellor [Mark] Norden—
berg and our athletic director, Steve Pederson,

' tremendous kudos for having the foresight to

be the aggressor and to pursue and accept an
invitation. Often times, people sit and they mull
over things, and they wait and they wait, and it
becomes too late.”

Berenato, who is entering her ninth season
as the Panthers’ head coach, said moving to the
ACC should not affect her team’s recruiting. She
said that shethinks the university — ratherthan
the conference — determines where recruits
choose to play.

“Student athletes wantto goto agreatuniver-

sity, and they want to play basketball, and they '

wantto be surrounded by great people,” she said.
“The University of Pittsburgh is a Top—1o public
school in the nation. We’re known worldwide, not
just on the East Coast. We have freshmen right
now from Florida, Tennessee, Newjersey, New

York and Seattle, Wash. So we recruit nationally '

and internationally as it is.”

Freshman guard Brianna Kiesel said Pitt’s
reputation as an elite academic and athletic insti-
tution mattered more to her during her college-
selection process than the chance to play in the
Big East. . A .

“I came to Pitt more [for] the education and
the team —_ not just the conference,” she said.

p ButAnderson said thatthe ACC’s prestige and
visibility has always caught her attention. 0

‘‘I’ve been followingACC basketball since Iwas
young,” she said. “I was recruited by some ACC
teams, soidid my homework. Theyhave multiple
teams thatmake the tournament. They have tra-

dition like the Big East. Plus,theywere always on
TV— you growup watchingthe Cameron Crazies
and thefans at North Carolina. I’m really looking
forward to playing all the different teams.”

For Berenato, who coached at Georgia Tech
before comingto Pitt, moving to the ACC means
returning to her roots.

“I got my ﬁrst start in the ACC at [North]
Carolina,’.’ she said. “So I’m very familiar with
the ACC —— I was there for 18 years.”

Berenato said that so far she has been warmly
received from her friends down south. She re-
ceived a text message from one of her former
players, saying that Berenato would return to

the ACC in time for the 20”‘ anniversary of their

National Championship.

“In the last week, I’ve probably heard from
15 to 20 former players from Georgia Tech,” Be-
renato said. “There was one lady who wrote me
whose kids used to be my ball girls. Now they’re
married and have kids. I’m like, ‘Holy Camole!
They can’t be married.’ I’rn just extremely ex’-
cited.” -

So excited, infact‘, that she can barelywait for
her team’s ﬁrst game as a member of the ACC.

“I always look at everything as, ‘Let’s go.’ You
know, ‘Bring it on, baby.” I
