Tyson Predicts Economic
Unity Among Nations

 

Francis Tyson, professor of eco-
nomics at the University, and a stu-
dent of European conditions, who
has traveled widely on ‘the continent
the last two summers, predicted
speedy formation of ,_ an economic
bond between nations there in apub-

Alic address Monday, at a Hungry

Club luncheon meeting at the Fort
Pitt Hotel. -James Rae, president of
the Pittsburgh Chamber of Com-
merce, presided. '

The economic “United States ‘of

Europe,” recently proposed to mem-
ber states of the League of Nations
by M. Aristide Briand, premier of
France, formed the subject of Prof.
Tyson’s speech. ‘ He pictured the

V movement to this end as receiving
-widespread support, not only

big the
chief political leaders of the uro-
pean powers, but bypowerful ﬁnan-

cial and‘ industrial groups as well, '

and asserted his belief that it would
move forward rapidly in the next
few years. -

Development of Bonds

Professor Tyson declared’ it his
opinion that the development of this
economic bond into a political fed-
eration, or true United States of
Eurgnpe. is still far away. This
change, he stated, must wait until
the people of the continent “learn
to think as Europeans,” as M.
Briand said. But even this radical
‘ jf-s ffes__,sentialj‘to"Euro-
E-"v=h¢I ax

      

3311

The speaker called attention to
the growing inﬂuence of this coun-
try in European affairs, especially
as an incentive for the various na-
tions on the continent to work out
some‘ agreement to abolish local
trade. barriers. -But he denied that
the suggested United States of Eu-
rope, either in its economic or po-
litical form, is directed specially
against America. ’ .

He pointed to the Young leader-
ship at reparations conference this
summer as an indication that Eu-
rope has more: real respect for
American prosperity than envy. The
proposed trade unity in Europe, if
it becomes effective, will seek to
e m u 1 a t e American ' achievement,
rather than compete and conﬂict
with it, he asserted.

Wipe Out Tariﬁs

Calling a federation‘ to wipe out
artiﬁcial -tariff barriers “the most
vital issue in the political life of
the continent today,” Professor

-Tyson emphasized the establishment

of international cartels in various
industries as a leading factor "in
bringing about such a rfederation;
This and the general agricultural de-
pression and the many low-wage in-
dustrial areas led the economist to

Harrison Talks

W. Don Harrison, in a statement
concerning the stand of the depart-
ment of athletics, said: “Pitt does
not, and has not during any time as
director, maintained ath1etes“at pre-
paratory schools priorrto their en-
rolling here, We do help ‘athletes

vices. The matter -of alumni‘ aiding
boys is strictly between the boys
themselves and alumni rmembers.
What an alumnus wishes*_to do for
any individual student is. no con-
cernof the University.” '

Discussing the matter of‘ giving
aid to athletes who are playing on
teams at Pitt, Mr. Gow said that-
an employment bureau is main-

to this conclusion after having used
for reference “The, Code of Jus-

The ; Panther, whose ;Vprodigious
appetite has not yet been appeased
by victories over four victims,.
choosesthe Allegheny football team

as its next prey. Tomorrow, the Gold '1

and Blue team from Pitt closes. the
ﬁrst half of its schedule by meeting
the Gold and Blue eleven from Alle- ’
gheny onlthe gridiron at the Munici-
pal stadium, Erie. I
Coach Crum’s men from Meadville
have-played three gamesso far this
season. They tied Geneva, 13-13, in
their first contest; Westminster eked
out a 7.-6‘win“in the next game,

while -on the . Saturday before last, i
Dartmouth overwhelmed them by_

the lopsided -~ score‘ of 53-0.
If one were to take the ﬁnal score
of ‘the Dartmouth game as any cri-

terion_ of therealstrength of Alle- 1

gheny,__i_t would‘a'ppea_r thatthe un-
clefeated Pitt t_eam will be able--to
trample’ all over them -without any
diﬂiculty. This score, however, does‘
not tellthe story of the‘ wonderful
ﬁght that the boys from»Meadville
put up‘ until almost their entire line
andbackﬁeld hadVt0 be filled in by
sn‘ns'iil:.u1'es. on account ofinjuries
sustained by the regulars before the
lust nail‘ ended. . _ V
Inasmuch as Allegheny had no‘
game last Saturday, most of the in-
juredplayers should have had plenty
of; time to recuperlbate. B_y tomorrow,
they should be‘ in the pink of condi-
tion, and prepared to give the Pan-
thersa‘ real battle. . ‘ ,
This will be_ the fourth time that
the two‘ teams have metin as many
consecutive years. The Panthers
came out victors each time. In 1926
the score -was 9-7;. in 1927 it was
62~D,Vand in 1928 the ﬁnal tally was
.29‘,Ol.';.: « ' - '
Alleghenyhas a‘ fairly heavy team
and uses somewhat the same style
of playing as Pitt, that is, they. com-
bine passing and running the ball
ina formidable attack. -
Coach Crum ,V has two sterling
playersin Garback and Berger, who
live verynear Pittsburgh. Garback
is . from‘E.dgewood, while. BBIfge,I"$
home is: in Homestead. ‘The stellar
perf.orm"ances «of these two warriors
at fullback and halfback, respec-
tively, has been a feature of every’
game_ in which they have‘partici-
Dated.-'., . - 
Al-tliqugh Pitt is the favorite, it is
not likely that they will try to run

up a big score, because, undoubtedly ..

Coach ~Sutherland'is" going to throw
in a lot oVf,substitutes' before the
game ends. - V :

’i‘he., entire squad of forty-two
players will leave Pittsburgh at
2:10 o’clock this afternoon and will
c.r{*iv'e in Eric at about 6:00 'o’clocl‘:

 

  

  
  

There d‘o‘esn’t"seem '-to‘ be‘ much to
worry. about tomorrow’s ' game - with
Allegheny up at Erie. In fact Your
Scout and many. other .Pit.t=”stud,en.tfS.
will.stay- home and see‘ .Notre Dame
play Carnegie Tech. The prediction
for tomorrow is Pitt 40, Allegheny 0.-

Speaking of ‘ prediction, ,your
conﬁdential Scout came through‘
in ﬁnestyle last week. The pre-
diction was Pitt 12,‘ Nebraska‘ 0. .

were goodpn both teams. Eyth and

Curdy’s placing of punts resembled

old Howie Harpster, but his selec- ~

tion of "plays was not so wise. His
strategy was ‘especially poor when

failed‘ to score. The’ Wash-‘Jeff play-

12-7 Victory o...ip....i.1
Huskers Boosts, Panthers.

 

 

A great Pitt team subdued ad

sturdy Nebraska eleven last Satur-

day, before 40,000 people at Lin- C

coin, and thereby climbed a "notch
closer to the nationaltitle. The Pan-

ther squad showed a well -polished
attack, as well as an adamant de-
fense to defeat the surprisingly fast
Cornhuskers, 12-7. ‘-

The favored Pitt elevendepended
upon its versatile" running attack to
produce scores. The vicious line-
plunging of Parkinson, the sharpest
tooth in the _ mouth of the Panther,
was the best ground-gaining device,
although the‘ off-tackle twists‘ of
Uansa, Williams and Walinchus

What may say

“The Daily Nebraskan,” Uni-
versity of Nebraska student
newspaper, had the following
comment on the game last Sat-
urday:

“A mighty driving, plunging
and unbeatable Golden ‘Pan-
ther football eleven from the
University of Pittsburgh crush- 2
red the University of Nebraska.-
Cornhuskers in Memorial sta- »
dium ﬁeld Saturday in one of
the greatest intersectional grid-
iron classics staged at Nebras-
ka for many years.” 1-

 

netted a bountiful yardage. A 55-
yard run by Walinchus was one ...of
the highli hts of the superb Pitts-
burgh o ense. Sliding off right
tackle, the Panther -halfback. cut
through the secondary offense and
dashed to the six-yard line before
being downed.

‘However, the rock-ribbed, indomi-

1 table line of Pitt was Sutherland’s

trump card. Nebraska’s runningata
tack was completely curbed, the
Huskers -being forced to resort to
the air for their offensive drive. Al-
though the .Nebraskans earned seven
ﬁrst downs to Pitt's eleven,.tlieir ef-
forts only gained 166.yards, only 50
of which were made through I the
powerful Pittiline. Most of the yard-
age wasgained by means offa for-
ward-passing attack, .efEectiv¢-
enough to produce one touchdown.
The sterl1ng_ end play of Donchess
played a prominent part in breaking
up most of the Nebraska plays. A
sure tackler and an uncanny play-
diagnoser, -the _Panther left end
played havoc with the ~weste.rner’s
offense, especially its aerial game.
Most of the 18 of the passes
grounded of the 31 thrown by the
Nebraskans, were batted down by
the _roving_ Donchess. Too much
credit ‘cannot be given_ the hard-

charging and splendid defensive tac.-.
tics of the other Pitt linemen, es-,

pecially Captain Dimeolo, Tully and?

Montgomery,‘ who ‘played ‘magniﬁ-2‘

cent football. .

The splendid work of Sloan on the
offensive and Greenberg on the de-
fense were the features of the
Cornhuskers’ play. All in all, the
Nebraska siquad played a fine brand
of football,._ possessing a deceptive
