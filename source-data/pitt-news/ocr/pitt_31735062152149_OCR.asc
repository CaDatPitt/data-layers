Scheduled For Today

 

Chairman 'David "Racusin

Promises Skip Houston’:-if

Transatlantic Dance Band, Silk Hose D001’ Pflze

. At Annual Affair In Schenley Ballroom

By Jove

It's hard to find a good lead for these style show dance

stories. -

For the last three years, Charlie Holstein, hiding under
the name. of Ron, pounded out the most intriguing, attention-

snatching openings ever used in The Pitt News. He even quoted  ll

Shakespeare. So whyattempt to better the master?

Suffice to say that the affair, this5

afternoon in the Sch-enley Hotel ball-
‘room will be just like all the others.
For the beneﬁt of the freshmen, may
we explain that this is theone dance
of the year where everything is fret,
you go stag, and the chairman doesn -t
promise a grand march. .

But the he-ad man, David Racusm,
C37, does promise_ that as an added
inducement, six pairs of silk.hose Wlll
be given away as door prizes. Jay
Reich, BA39, his assistant, calls this
‘offer “bigger. better. and” mor-e
abundant than ever_ before. The
hose comes from Wise’s shoe store,
where most of the salesmen are from
the University. Members of'the News
staff will not win any prizes, says
Racusin. _

A word about the orchestra. It is
lSkip Houston's Transatlantic Dance
band, which has caused hundreds of
people to hop and sway on sundry
ocean liners, the S. ‘S. President Hard-
ing, the S. S. Leviathan, to name a
few. Herb Cohen, who WTO-‘Ce the
music for a song in the Cap an-d
Gown show two years ago, is featured
at the piano. _ _

The mannequins are: Hilary Lurle
(cu-te kid); Peggy McGee (0; _K-)3
Nancy Hyles (uhuh)3 Betty Williams
(whee); Betty Brooks (oh my. yes);
Barbara Thoma-s (red head); Jen}?
McDonald (nice); Rose Nugen_t (its
there); Betty‘ Wfiinrlght (Oh Wllk'1e)_;
Myrtle Gordon ”(beauty_)§ ReV9~ N91‘
man (see the Owl); Vivian Roberts
(Ann Harding); Frances Calhoun (a
veteran); Peggy Donley (blo-nde);
Rosemary Lutz (yas, yas); Estelle
Kovacs (petite); Madelaine Batty
(class) ; Ru-th Hilsenrath (of course) ;
Irene Maroney (dark eyes) ;. Beverly
Childress (mmmm), and Sylvia Briggs
(some babe).

That makes 21. And there are a
like number of men, who make up in
handsomeness what they lack in
grace. ' _

Woodruff To Tell
Of Olympic Trip

Johnny Woodruff, C39, will be the
featured speaker at the Intercultural
Associates’ Hallowe’en party and
dance tomorrow evening, from 8 to 11
o’clock in the Y clubrooms on Forbes
and Bouquet Streets.

The WPA Gypsies band, with seven
pieces, has been engaged to provide
entertainment and music for dancing.

Woodruff will tell of his experi-
ences on his trip this summer. to
Berlin, where he represented the Uni-
versity in the Olympics Games and
was _crowned 800-meter champion.

All members and visitors who at-
tend are asked to wear their spook-
iest costumes and masks. Identities
are not to be revealed until the end
of the party. Refreshments will in-
clude cider and cookies. Admission
is free.

Cap And Gownfs
Masquerade Hop
Tickets Available

Prizes Will Be Awarded
During Grand March,
For Odd Costumes

“It’s unprecedented,”
Blum, C38, chairman.

“But there are some left," says
Ben Baskin, C37, publicity chairman.

They refer to the sale of tickets
to the Cap and Gown masquerade
dance this Friday evening at the
Pittsburgh Country Club. Blum and
Baskin wish to have it understood
that you can buy tickets (at two dol-
lars for two people) from practically
anybody.

The 50 or so men connected with
Cap and Gown who have petitioned
for membership have already bought
theirs, it is reported. This is due to
the fact that the tapping ceremonies
will be held at midnight, and they
must be present. No one will be
tapped by proxy.

Prizes To Be Given

But that’s not all. Prizes, “worth-
while,” according to Blum, will be
awarded for the most original and
humorous costumes. To make the se-
lection easier, there will be a sort
of informal grand march past the
judges, who will be announced later.
‘ihree awards are offered—one for
the best costume (male); another for
the best costume (female), and a
third for the couple whose clothes
complement each other’s best.

Reports indicate that brains are
being racked for disguises. One
gentleman is coming as a cornﬁeld.
Another is to be Oliva Dionne, and
another, with a minimum of makeup,
will masquerade as Frankenstein.

But the chairman and publicity
manager urge that simplicity and
cleverness, rather than elaborateness,
be the keynote. “You can come as
a bum or college professor,” is
Blum’s statement.

Cap and Gown anticipates hav-
ing ‘more such affairs in the future,

says Bill

‘thereby becoming a social organiza-

tion, as well as an undergraduate
theatrical group.

Political Scientists List
t  Questions In Campaign

Di's. Charlesworth, Graper,

Williams Review Situation

From Impersonal Viewpoint, Declaring Present

‘V’-Taxes, Business Regulation Among Issues

By Robert Saffron

What‘ are the fundamental issues
in the present campaign?

With the election to be held next
Tuesday, the question is still very
much befo-gged. The campaign has
been ﬁlled with so much name—call-
ing, spectre-raising, and contradic-
tory statements that even the most
astute political observer has difficulty
seeing through the obscurity.

This ambiguity is not character-
istic of this campaign alone, how-
ever. The major political parties
have always avoided or beclouded is-
sues. As Dr. James C. Charlesworth,
associate professor of political sci-
ence, remarks below, the Republicans
and Democrats te-nd to compromise
and minimize prospective policies in
the interests of party harmony.

Nevertheless, we have undertaken
to pose the question to several pro-
fessors in the social sciences—-politi-
cal science, history, and economics-—
who by virtue of their experience in

their different ﬁelds might be able to
cle-ar up the political puzzle. These
men are not statingttheir individual
pr-eferences, nor are ‘they attempting
to sway the reader in his choice.
(Voters are seldom persuaded by the
reading of an impassionate article,
anyh-ow.) The answers are merely
an attempt at an impartial analysis
of what the issues are. A

Professed Issues

Dr. Charlesworth takes up three
points—what the generally accepted
issues are, what the principal issue is
in his opinion, and what are not the
issues. These, he says, are the pro-
fessed issues:

‘‘(1) .'las the public debt been ex-
panded to the point where it has en-
dangered the public credit? (2) In
our foreign trade, should we abandon
our sponsorship of internati-onal bar-
ter and return to a tariff system
which amounts substantially to an

Judge Moore Will Discuss
Jury System At John
Marshall Reception

“The jury system in the United
Sta-tes—its origin and present usage,”
will be disciis=ed tonight by Judge

,  George V. Moore,
in e m b e r of the
bench of the Court
of Common Pleas,
at the reception
for all pre-legal
students being
given by the John
Marshall Club,
honorary pre-legal
fraternity, in
Room 1409, Cathe-
draL

After graduat-
ing from Adrian
College in 1910,
Judge Moore en-
tered the University Law School, at-
tend-ed for two years, received special
coaching, and was admitted to the
Bar in 1913.

Returning from 17 months in
France, Judge Moore again took up
his practice of law. The Judge was a
captain of infantry in the Third Reg-
ular Army.

From 1921 to 1925, he was Assist-
ant District Attorney for Allegheny
County, and resigned in order to ac-
cept an appointment by former Gov-
ernor Giﬁ’»ord Pinchot to the Common
Pleas Court bench. He succeeded the
late Judge Haymarket.

Judge Haymarket’s uncompleted
term was for 22 months, so that in
the November election of 1927 Judge
Moore was succvessful in regaining his
seat. His present term does not ex-
pire until January 1, 1938. At the
-time of his election, he was 37 years
of age, the youngest member of the
bench.

In recognition of his service over-
seas, Judge Moore was named com-
mander of the Hilltop Post of the
American Legion, and he still partici-
pates in the activities of this organi-
zatioii.

During the evening, Hubert Teitle-
baum, C37, president of the frater-
nity, will announce the new tappees
of the group. Fifteen undergraduates
will be tapped. All pre-legal students
are invited to attend, whether or not
they are eligible at this time.

Arrangements for the reception
have been completed by Stanley
Rogaliner, BA37, chairman of the
affair. He was assisted by Nathan
Schwartz, BA37; Howard Engelmvan,
C38; Valera Grapp, C37, and Evelyn
Lowy, C38. Refreshments will be
served.

German Youth

To Study Here

Max Katz, Refugee Student,
To Register Today

Max Katz and Alf Landon arrived at
the Pennsylvania station at the same
time yesterday morning. ,

An-d Max didn't even know who
Alf was.

Max is a German youth who begins
his study in the University depart-
ment of chemistry this morning. He
was amazed at the crowd -in the
depot, and when told that Landon was
coming, with a rising inﬂection in-
quir-ed: “Who is Landon?”

It seems that in Frankf-ort-Am-
Main, foreign newspapers are a thing
of the past. -

Max comes to the University on a
special scholarship gran-t fostered by
the local chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi
fraternity, in accordance with its na-
tional policy of sponsoring German-
J ewisli refugee students who wi-sh to
further their studies in the United
States. "

Having been a tutor in English for
the past two years, Max ﬁnds it easy
to converse with Americans, although
he speaks with a noticeable accent. ,

iln addition to being a good scholar,
Max has already shown amazing dex-
terity_with a ping-pong paddle.

 

Chemical Engineers
Will Meet Tomorrow

 

Sophomore, junior and senior chem-
ical engineers will hold their seminar
meeting tomorrow in the Fellows’
Room of the Mellon Institute. Dr.
T. A. Wilson will deliver the third
lecture in the series of discourses by
specialists engaged in research at the
Institute. Dr. Wilson will speak on
“Radiations and Their Utility in the
Industries.”

Freshmen will meet as usual in
Room 208, Cathedral. They will be
addressed by Harrison C. Bashioum,
head of the department of chemical
engineering, who will speak on “The
Chemical Engineer and the American

Institute of Engineering.”

Mark Falls Three Short Of Last Year’s

More Frosh Than Ever Before

PHI EPSILON PI LEADS FIELD

Delts, Six Behind Phi Eps, Place Second With Twenty;
Phi Kaps, Pi Lams Take Third As Predictions
In Dean Of Men’s Ofﬁce Go Haywire

As only 169 men became pledges Monday night at 13
fraternities, the rushing ﬁgure missed equalling last year’s
results by a margin of three men.

In the number of bids fraternities submitted, and in the
number of men bid, the ﬁgures topped by far any other results

in the records.

619 bids were placed in the office‘ of the dean

of men last Monday for 396 men. Last year the corresponding

"~°numbers were 596 and 374.

Session Monday

Xylon To Sponsor Assembly
On Securing Publicity
For Local Groups

All campus organizations are re-
ceiving invitations this week to send
a representative to a Publicity As-
sembly sponsored by Xylon, women’s
honorary journalism fraternity, on
Monday, at 3:30 o’clock in Room
1309, Cathedral.

In sponsoring this assembly, Xylon
aims to point out to publicity chair-
men the proper approach for secur-
ing publicity and the way to edit the
news.

Graham To Talk

The speakers will be: Robert X.
Graham, instructor in English and
director of the University News Serv-
ice; Helen Rose Gibson, editorial
supervisor of the Research Bureau
for Retail Training; Eugene Burk-
hart, publicity assistant at the Uni-
versity, and Martha Bedsworth, C37,
president of Xylon.

The assembly will be attended by
approximately 60 chairmen of cam-
pus organizations. All organizations
not having publicity chairmen will
send their secretaries to represent
them.

Kathryn Hardy, C37 , is chairman
of the committee planning the as-
sembly. Assisting Miss Hardy are
Albert Kairys, BA39, William Kun-
kel, C39, aand members of Xylon.

Last year Xylon sponsored three
Forums in the form of panel discus-
sions. The first of these discussions
was devoted to problems of gathering
the news, the second to organizing,

and the third to editing and writing
news.

Refreshmentswill be served at the
close of Mond-ay"s. assembly.

Phi Epsilon Pi led all houses with
26 pledges. Delta Tau Delta was sec-
ond with 20, followed by Phi Kappa.
and Pi Lambda Phi with 19 each.

Two explanations were offered in
the ‘office of the dean for men for the
drop in number of pledges while
number of bids increased. One was
the fact that rushing season was
shortened to six days, the other, that

Sigma Alpha Mu did not rush, and
submitted no bids.

No Pledging For Month

Last year's rushing season lasted
10 days, with one week of silence
between rushing and pledging. No
freshmen will be permitted to pledge
a fraternity until after the Thanks-
giving vacation, in accordance with
an Interfraternity Council ruling in
effect for the last two years, whereby
no fraternity may acquire new
pledges for one month after the reg-
ular pledging period.

Included in the list of 169 pledges
were ﬁve men pledged to Kappa Al-
pha Phi, professional fraternity in
the School of Business Administra-
tion.

Estimates in the office of the dean
of men were further off than at any
time within the memory of the oldest
observer. Theodore W. Biddle, assistr

Roosevelt To Retain Lead, Poll Indicates

Visser’t Hooft Condemns Absolutists

WAR and social chaos are inevitable as long as one nation
refuses to feel a responsibility for other nations, and as
long as people take refuge in the “negative” paciﬁsm typical
of today, in the opinion of Dr. W. A. Visser’t Hooft, interna-
tional religious worker, who addressed Inquiry Forum Monday.

Dr. Visser’t Hooft scoffed the “superstition” that by in-
tellectual education society can hope to deal with international
problems. llihe only solution to present problems lies in “work-
ing ourselv'e'§'backito a_.discovery of God,” declares Dr. Visser’t

Hooft.

The Second Invasion

N .THE PITT football 

squad’s last New York inva-
sion, the Gothamites poured into
the Polo grounds expecting most

. anything in. the way.—_of power ex-

plosions from the Pitt eleven.

.But when the Sutherland ma-

chine was stopped virtually cold
by what was believed to be only
a mediocre Fordham “air circus,”
the New Yorkers were just a bit
disappointed to ﬁnd that they
had probably been fooled by
over-powered press agents. Per-
haps, -too, they did not apprecia-
ate the full strength of their

home ‘team.

Atiany rate, Dr. Sutherland’s
squad departs early Friday morn-
ing to erase last year's impres-
sion of Pitt football. They will
again meet one of the best, if
not the strongest, defensive
teams in" the country. Not one
touchdownihas been scored by
the opposition while Fordham’s
full strength has been out there

I on the ﬁeld. While it is true that
* the

Ram defense has been
stopped short by one touchdown
in two major games, those same
backs have ripped through minor
teams like Franklin and Mar-
shall for sixty-six points.
Saturday will be the turning
point in this school’s 1936 season.
If the boys pass this third major
test, it will mean that they will
have nosuperiors in the East.
and few equals in the entire na-
tion. They will be meeting their
ﬁfth consecutive undefeated op-
ponent. This time the New
Yorkers should not be disap-
pointed in Pitt football. This
time they should once more real-
ize that Pitt football is right up
on the top. ‘

pound of smoking tobacco went to
N. Robert Seidle director of the

one that Mr. Biddle is a non-smoker,
the other that Robert Corley, assist-

ant to the dean of men, missed by
-more than twice as much as Mr.

will drag out the mats in their Sta-

tutelage of Coach Mazeski prepare
for a season of inatburns, bruises,

able to begin practice earlier because
of his duties as football coach at
South Side High School.

Graduation took Art Detzel,
heavyweight, Al Noble, 145-pounder,

having each won a freshman letter
in the bone crushing sport. They
are Lawrence Roffner, John Allen,

Frosh Grid Squad
Drills For State

After tasting defeat for the sec-
-ond successive time, Co-ach Mike Milli-
gan is sending his freshman foot-
ball squad through some tough scrim-
mages in preparation for the annual
tussle with the Penn State Lion Cubs
Saturday at Shady-side.

Last year the Panther yearlings
upset the Nittany lads with a 6-0.
score after l-osing their ﬁrst two
games. In 1934 the'Pitt frosh hand-
ed the State freshmen their only de-
feat of the season.

The State eleven will be out to
register their second consecutive vic-
tory on Saturday, having beaten
Scranton-Keystone Junior College,
19-7, in its opener. Dick Ewalt, a Pitts-
burgh boy, playing at the right half-
back berth, was the sparkplug in the
Lion Cub attack, scoring two touch-
downs in the third quarter. State
gridders will depart for Pittsburgh
on Friday morning. The game orig-
inally w-as scheduled to be played at
State College, Pa., but a change in
-the schedule brings the Lion Cubs to
Pit-tsburrgh.

extra strain on diges-

Smoking camels with meals and after helps bring
a delightful sense of well-being

ATING is one of life’s real plea-
E sures. And Camels make it even
more enjoyable! Thanks to Camels,
food tastes better and digestion goes
along more smoothly. For it is a scien-
tiﬁcally established fact that smoking
Camels at mealtime and after speeds
up the flow of digestive ﬂuids...alka-
line digestive ﬂuids, which good di-

gestion and proper nutrition require.

Mild, rich- tasting Camels are a
refreshing stand-by the whole day
through. They give you a cheery
“lift” when you need it most. Camels
set you right! They never get on
your nerves . . . tire your taste . . . or
irritate your throat. So, make Camel

prefers Camels. “An athlete has to have
good digestion,” says Lester. "I smoke
a lot during meals and after. Camels
make food taste better and digest easier.”

 
   

“TALK ABOUT A GRAND FEELING,”
reports Sydney Jones, expert electrician.
“The best part of my meals is when I loll
back and have another Camel. Camels
always set me right...calm me down...
make my food taste better and help my
digestion. Camels never iangle my nerves.”

However, Orientals prefer the
stage. They come to. the theater at

tions of boxes, and cry aloud 1n sym-
pathy with the actors. Four plays,

Glee Club Will Hold
New Member Rehearsal

 

 

A special invitation has been sent
out to all students interested in choral
singing to attend the third rehear-
sal of the Evening Session Glee Club
to be held in Room 108, Cathedral.
November 2, at 9:35 P. M., according
to Harold Hosack, manager.

Fred W. Lotz, director of the club, I

has repeatedly emphasized that pre-
vious experience in singing is not es-
sential and urges that all interested
students turn out for the next re-
hearsal when new music will be dis-
tributed.

Very shortly, Mr. Lotz plans to
begin the rehearsals for the carol
singing held annually during the
