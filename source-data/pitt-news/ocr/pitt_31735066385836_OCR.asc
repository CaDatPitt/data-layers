UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

PPC, RSA
sponsor
spring

festival

By Mark Staf
Staff Writer

The Office of Residence Life,
the Resident Student Association
and the Pitt Program Council are
gearing up for this year’s Spring
Fling. '

Spring Fling will be divided
into two parts. The first part, a
river cruise sponsored by the PPC,
will take place this Sunday from 1
to 4 p.m. The second part, an
outdoor festival sponsored by the
ORL, will beheld next Wednesday
in Forbes Quadrangle.

The river cruise‘ will be a
Pittsburgh sightseeing trip on the
Gateway Clipper Fleet’s Party
Liner, and according to PPC’s
Erin Carney, all decks (including

the top deck if weather permits) -

will be open.

Included on the cruise will be a
band, a disc‘ jockey, snacks and a
cash bar. I.D. will be required to
purchase alcoholic beverages, and
Carney said that everyone ’s hands
will be stamped. .

T In the past, PPC has scheduled
formal dances for the spring, but
they have been unsuccessful. “We
have tried to get together a spring
formal, but it always ﬂopped
[because of] all of the other formals
at this time of the year,” Carney
said.

This year, PPC decided to get
together with ORL and RSA and
have a casual dancing/drinking
cruise. “This is not a formal event
or a date thing,” Carney said.
“Bring your friends; have a good
time, and go sailing.”

The band‘ will be Justhefax,
which won the PPC talent show,
and the disc jockey will be Vick
Terry, who played records at the
Fall Fling carnival in the Schenley
Quadrangle last term. Both the DJ
and the band were planned to
ensure musical diversity.

Plenty of tickets, at $5 for students
and $7 for non-students, are
available. Tickets are on sale until
6 p.m. today. Tickets will not be
on sale over the weekend. Carney
said that tickets may be sold at the
boat, but she stressed that those

j who want- to go on. the cruise

should buy their tickets by
-tonight's deadline.

The carnival in the Quad will
be from‘-4 to ,8 p.m. Resident»

‘ director Sue Uhazie said that the

'_carnival’s activities will include a

Lack of parking hurts Oakland merchants

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Last fall, when a handicapped
man parked his car in a loading
zone to enter the New Oakland
Tailor shop on Meyran Avenue
for a few minutes, he got a $32
ticket. Gino Deluliis, owner of
the shop, said that this type of
“merciless attitude" is typical of
the policemen who patrol the
streets of Oakland.

“Those policemen stink. There
is one particular one who has no
consideration for anyone at all.
When I asked‘ him why he had
given that handicapped man a

ticket, he said it was because he
didn’t have a
[designating that he was
handicapped], Couldn’t he see
that the man could hardly walk?"
said Deluliis. , / ‘

Deluliis’ business is located on
Meyran Avenue betwen Forbes
and Fifth Avenues. Half of that
block is a. no—parking zone; the
other half is a 15-minute loading
zone. Many of Deluliis’ customers
park in the loading zone.

“We don’t have any meters on
the street, so how are we
supposed to park legally?” he
asked.

Deluliis added that he thinks

license plate .

the University of Pittsburgh is
adding to the problem.

“Thanks to Pitt, parking is
getting worse. They keep on
buying lots to build on, and that
just makes the problem worse,”
he said.

Deluliis’ complaints, were
echoed by many other Oakland
merchants. LeMonte Pruitt, who
manages Victor's Luggage and
Shoe Repair, works across the
street from Deluliis’ shop.

“A lot of times, people call and
ask how the parking is around
here before they come to the
store. I think that the parking
might deter people from coming

out here. Fortunately, most of my
customers are people who are
already in this area and [can] walk
[to the storel,” he said.

Pruitt added that those who do 0

drive to his shop usually just.take
their chances with parking
illegally.

“Usually, they can get away

with it because they are only in
"here for a couple of minutes.
They have to do that because
Oakland parking is practically
nonexistent,” he said.

For some business owners,
availability of parking spaces isn’t
the problem. Matt Hoss, owner of

Sabletting oﬁers alternative to year-long lease

By Christopher McCall
Staff Writer

Spring is. coming. Students
show off what’s left of their
Daytonatans; music blares out of
open windows, and summer-
sublet leaflets. cover every
billboard on campus. Yes, it's
that time of the year when off-
campus Oakland residents
struggle to get around yearly
leases so that they can go’ home
for the sumr_ne_r., . _

Students say that they are stuck
with year-long’ leases“ because

    

landlords don’t want to go through
the trouble of finding summer
residents. The students give the
landlords’ unwillingness as a
reason as to why there is no
demand in the summer; with less
than half the potential. renters

than the rest of the year, and‘

therefore, no money canbe made.

According to Lisa Borden, a
fifth-year pharmaceutical student
who just found a sublessee
yesterday, landlords» “know

they’re  to get _‘t1ie_ rhoneyl
with a- yearly lease. We’ve rented"

from" [the M&M Real Estate

Company] for years, and they still
haven’t given us a nine-month
lease."

“They didn’t feel like doing any
work; they wanted to put the
pressure on us," said George
Lovera, a- junior black? studies

major, who also has found‘

sublessees. _ .

“Through subletting, there is a
zero-percent chance of getting
what you want. Let’s say 80
percent of college students. are
leaving for the summer, and only
130 percent. are looking fora piace
to stay. They can pick whatever

they want.vWe pay $750 a month;
they [our sublesseesl pay $600 a

said.Lovera. ‘

The April Fool 

There's more to the legendary man than just jokes

Byjessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

Calendar conscientious and
time-minded people‘ be
forewarned; April Fool’s Day is
quickly creeping up behind
unsuspecting victims to hopefully
catch them with their pants

~ down...

This centuries-old observance
is mostly practiced today by
school children and some adults
with a taste for the absurd.
Because it has no seemingly direct
ties to any Judeo-Christian
religious ritual, its origin is often
vague and infrequently taught.

Its timing is closely related to
the vernal equinox, when Mother
Nature “fools” mankind with her
abrupt changes in weather. Its
observance was claimed to have
originated in France after the
adoption of a new calendar by
Charles IX circa 1564. Up to that

time, the New Year’s celebration
began March 21 and ended April
1, which again was related to the
first day of spring celebration.

When New Year’s Day was
changed to January 1, there were
still many people who celebrated
it on April 1. Those who observed
the new year in April would then
be the subject of usually harmless
practical jokes. In France, they
were called poisson d 'avrtl which
means “April ﬁsh.” In Scotland
they were called gowks.

The ﬁgure of the Fool with his
pointed hat and often ridiculous
behavior has even more curious
lore surrounding him than the
day dedicated to his folly.

As well as being called the »

Fool, he is also referred to as the
Jester, the Joker, the Looney Man
and the Lunatic. “Lunacy”
suggests pre-Christian lunar
religions and the madness
associated with them.

The Fool’s dunce cap was
derived from the apex, a conical
miter worn by Rome's ceremonial

high priest. His costume and silly
acts suggest Spanish and Oriental
origins. Attracting crowds with

their music and antics, these
“fools” presented mystery plays
that held secret religious
messages.

The element of the Fool’s
ignorance may have been the
only reason that it was preserved
in today's playing- card decks.
Seen as the Joker, it is the only
card from the Major Arcana of
the Tarot (which playing cards
are based on) to survive.

If you are at a loss as to what

jokes to play on people, here are
a few suggestions to make your
April Fool’s Day even more fun:
1. Get a Menudo album cover
and fill it with shaving cream.
Stick device under the victim's
locked door and stomp down
with vigor.

mate and find out where your

friends and family stand on th

it Fraternities not exempt from campus rules

When Liquor Control Board agents and local police raided three hilltop fraternity
houses on April 16 last year, 104 Pitt students were cited for underage drinking. This
was one week after Greek Week had ended, and Delta Tau Delta, which finished third
in the annual competition, was one of the houses raided.

Kent Baldauf, who at the time was president of both Delta Tau Delta and the Student
Government Board,‘said that 12 underage drinkers were pulled from his fraternity; Phi
Kappa Theta reportedly had 75 underage drinkers, and Sigma Chi had the remaining

17.

Dennis Donham, acting vice president for student affairs, Said at the time that it was
“extremely, unfortunate that‘ something like this had to happen.” It’s even more
unfortunate when you consider that it never should have happened.

"‘fThe 'eight'fraternities on the hill ‘were completed in 1984, with three-quarters of the
‘l$f4,S0’,’OO0"required: for each complex supplied by the university. The »-remaining 25

percent was supplied by the respective fraternities. Under the agreement between Pitt
and the fraternities, each organization was granted a 99-year lease on the house and
exclusive use of the units, which house 25 students each. If the rooms could not be filled
by the fraternity, the university reserved the right to place non-Greeks there, just as in
the residence halls on campus. C

All of the fraternities, however, were and still are chartered under university policy.
While the university allows the frats to be largely autonomous and governed by the
Inter-Fraternity Council, Pitt officials do have the right. to govern the fraternities. The
university is the majority owner of each hilltop fraternity house and also owns the land
on which they are built. Yet when problems arise, the university does not take a public
stance. if ‘ ' . ' .

While all campus organizations deserve to govern themselves, the university is
delinquent in its authority. The fraternities are residence halls for members of student
groups, nothing more, The university does not have the right to interfere with the

- interworkings of the fraternity structure, but itcan govern what happens on campus and

in the houses.

So why is it that under university policy, anyone over the age of 21 and living in the
residence halls is allowed only two six—packs of beer per week, while the fraternities
can order truckloads of kegs at a time? 1

The university rules apply to all students, not just non-Greeks. If they can have night-
long parties, so can those who live in the residence halls. And if students who live on
campus cannot have more than half a case of beer per week, then neither can the
Greeks. The policy preventing underage drinking “varies from house to house,” former
IFC President Chuck Farinella said at the time the infractions occurred last year. And
apparently, it varies from student to student as well. C

With Greek Week once again coming to an end, the beer will again begin to flow on

V the hill. With foresight, the fraternities may not allow underage students (except new

brothers and underage girlfriends, of course) into the parties. But it is obvious that it
is time for this hypocrisy to end, and for the university to treat all its students alike, both
for the protection of the students and the integrity of _Pitt’s name. 4 ,

As Donham told The Pitt News last year, “We don’t have a sanctuary on campusfor
underaged drinkers, and we don’t want the wrong people thinking that we do.” That
is the system that exists now, and it must end now.

And for those fraternities who believe this is an unfair cut, show us your charter. We’re
sure it says, “To promote charity, brotherhood, academia and consumption of large
quantities of beer.” Cheers.

Parking still problem

If someone were to ask me if I
wanted a ticket, I would be in-

clined to ask many questions in «

return in order to find out what
sort of ticket I was being offered.

My inquisition would certainly
center around where this ticket
would take me. A Pirates game
would be nice. An X-rated movie
would be even better. Traffic
court, however, is one place I
would not like to visit at the
expense of a ticket.

So if a parking ticket — instead
of a pass to a baseball game or a

- film —- was what this generous

someone had in mind, then surely
I would refuse this suddenly not-
so—bountiful offer.

The problem, however, is that
parking tickets cannot be de-
clined. They are not optional. If
someone happens to stumble
upon the misfortune of being
ticketed for automotive—related
reasons, then it’s an inconven-
ience which must be suffered.

Suffering is not pleasant. It’s
especially hard to stomach,
though, if it is not deserved, and
many Pitt students are being
penalized with parking tickets,
when in essence they don’t de-
serve to be fined at all.

Pitt, you see, continues to subsist
without adequate parking facili-
ties for its student drivers. Al-
though there are afew desig-
nated parking zones, such as the
garage underneath the Towers,
parking places remain entirely
too limited. Students continue to
pay the prices of parking tickets
because of a lack of available
parking.

Now this is beginning to sound
like communism. Thankfully, if
this happens to be a communist
ploy on behalf of the university,
then we’ll know their plans won’t

-flourish for much longer, since

communism is undisputedly on
its way out.

But seriously, men like Bill
Barron, the security officer who
efficiently scatters parking tickets
throughout the Schenley Quad-
rangle, should try to curb their
expensive ticket-issuing appetites
at least a little. If he were paid in
consonance with how many tick-
ets he distributes, instead of a
salary, he would probably be a
millionaire. “I like to issue tick-
ets," Barron commented in a

sinister way. “If they can’t read
the signs, t.hey’ll pay.” _
Well, I got some news for you,
Mr. Barron. It’s not that we can’t
read the signs that say “15-minute
parking for bank customers or
bank business, others will be
ticketed and towed at owners
expense” — we do go to college,

you know. As a matter of fact, we
go to this college, Pitt, the place
that doesn’t provide sufficient
parking for its students. So why
don’t you jot that down on your
ticket tablet and see if you can
really figure out why we students
park in the Quad? The fact re-
mains that despite Pitt's future
parking plans, there is no imme-
diate alleviation to this somewhat

serious problem. Currently, we

students have virtually nowhere
else to park.

Furthermore, Mr. Barron, we’re
all aware that you have a dirty
job,and that even rotten jobs
must be done. What we do not
understand, however, is why you
get so much pleasure from caus-
ing so much grief. .

Finally, those of you at the to
of the university hierarchy who
can create change must remem-
ber that cars can’t be driven all
the time, just as people can’t
always be awake. Cars, like
mankind, need rest. We sleep in
beds. Our cars need parking spots.
How can we sleep comfortably
on our worn-out mattresses when
we know our cars lie somewhere
unprotected by wicked ticket
givers and tow trucks? The truth
is we can’t. So how about institut-
ing some change? More frankly,
how about some temporary park-
ing places. Whadda ya say?

THE PI’l'I' NEWS, Thursday, March 29, 1990 I

T he Second Amendment is stated per ectly clear
(namely, so-ca led “assau t" weap-

The Constitution is a wonder-
fully stable and viable structure
for a government that has en-
dured for some 200 years, but it
is far from perfect. Its many
ambiguous passages -have often
led the courts to interpret its
meaning differently. However,
some portions are crystal clear,
which attests to the importance
the founding fathers placed on
them. Among these is the Second
Amendment:

“A Well-regulated Militia, being
necessary to the security of the
State, the Right of the People
to Keep and Bear Arms shall not
be infringed.”

The literal meaning of the
amendment is impossible to
misunderstand; indeed, it’s so
unambiguous that before the 20th

century, the amendment was
seldom challenged by legisla-
tion. Even so, recently the oppo-
nents of gun ownership have
muddled the intent of the-found-
ing fathers. Their arguments
usually are about as plausible
and appealing as they are com-
pletely false.

One such argument centers on
the word “militia.” Gun- control
advocates insist that this only
guarantees weapons to be used
by the Army and National Guard.
However, the framers of the
Constitution were using the 18th-
century deﬁnition of militia,
which meant men over the age
of 18 who owned firearms. Cer-
tainly Jefferson, Madison and
Washington, all country gentle-
men who owned guns but did
not belong to formal militias,
would not pass an amendment

that would prevent them from
using their firearms.

Another argument reads that
the Second Amendment may

 

Ro
Lewis

guarantee private ownership of
certain guns, but other guns

ons) are not. There is absolutely
no basis for this view. If there
were, the founding fathers in 1790
would have taken steps to keep
the Kentucky rifle, the most for-
midable military weapon of the
day, out of the hands of the
people, thereby restricting pri-
vate ownership of "musket-like
weapons; that they did not is
proof of their intent. Today, thou-
sands. of “assault” weapons are
used privately, with less than 1
percent ever used in a crime.
The most prevalent argument is
for mandatory waiting periods
and background checks. The only
things such restrictions would
accomplish would be a huge,
expensive bureaucracy and the
growth of the already huge ﬁre-
arms black market. Instead, stiffer
prison sentences for people con-

5

victed of crimes using a gun
would better deter criminals and
remove the most dangerous ones
from our streets without penaliz-
ing innocent people. The
Constitution tries to ensure pro-

tection of law-abiding citizens . '

from such nitpicking harassment.

The American public has long
enjoyed the right to bear arms for
sport, recreation and personal
protection. For many even to-
day, the use of firearms is neces-
sary for survival — consider the
lifestyle of an Alaskan, for ex- I
ample.

The framers of the Constitution
considered this right a requisite
for survival also, the survival of
the freedoms they so carefully
ensured. Considering that most
use this right responsibly and
safely, this right must be guarded
and never taken from us.

Latest Oliver Stone movie is nothing but a farce

There seems to be a pervasive

dishonesty spreading through-

out Hollywood these days. What’s
also disturbing is that so many
movies seem to have some type
of hidden political message
behind them, with the actors,
director or writer roguishly de-
nying so, -as their movie turns
from entertainment to sheer
political propaganda. Indeed, it
often seems as though the mod-
ern actor’s political leanings are
a prerequisite for a movie role: “I
think you're perfect for the part,
Mr. Asner, and please tell me
how your fund-raising work for
the Salvadoran Marxist guerrillas
is coming.”
Yes, the good old days of
movies like Sergeant York’ and
The Longest Day. are long gone.
The silver screen is now packed
with anti-American ﬁlms, such as
the numerous cinematic slanders
concerning the Vietnam War. The
sad thing about modern Holly-
wood is that there are no Viet-
nam War movies which feature
the confusion in the Johnson
Administration over exactly who
dictated war policy. Or even at
film that, while containing a
somber ending, portrays the
United States as a country com-
ing to the aid of an ally (South
Vietnam) which had been in-
vaded by Communist subversives
(North Vietnam). I
The latest canonized Holly-
wood ‘ director/mythomaniac,
Oliver Stone, is trying to rewrite
history to further his claim. that

Concerned

Mario Oliverio pleads for us to
understand that he is well within
his rights to spoutparanoid rav-
ings about gay people. As 

_ a cult as it may be forcme to_take
,,serr5us1y anybody wlio expresses I
I pride ‘i.n,be_ing,a homophobe (thati

means afraid of gay people), I am
afraid that he is entitled‘ to. rave
under the First Amendment.

My problem is that The Pitt
News allows such drivel to ﬁnd its
way on the “editorial” page.
Mario's little column expressed
nothing more than unsubstanti-
ated prejudice. Most editors, when
writing about controversial is-

the United States is a “fascist
state.”

Stone’s latest treacherous cre-
tin is the movie Born On the

Fourth of July the title itself -

provides the perfect tint of sar-
casm to let the eager viewer
know he’s in for an excellent two
hours of America-bashing.
Stone always piously claims
that his Vietnam portrayals are
objective, thus only outraging
the patriotic viewer who is too
closed—minded and ethnocentric
to see Uncle Sam’s imperialist,
blood-dripping fangs. However,
when digging into the true facts
underscoring every Stone squalor,
as Washington Times reporter
Diana West did for Born on the
Fourth of july—- a movie adver-
tised as a “true story of inno-
cence lost and courage found” —-
we ﬁnd that maybe Mr. Stone
might be pushing his own agenda,
masked under the disguise of a
realistic Vietnam movie based
on the real life of the Vietnam
veteran Ron Kovic. A
To those who wasted their
money on this piece of fiction, a
few facts should be known. First
of all, Stone didn’t manufacture
all of Kovic’s biography; Kovic
was an honorable Marine who
fought and was badly wounded
in Vietnam. End of facts.
Despite Stone’s presentation,
Kovic’s commander did not coldly
and incompassionately (you
know, in that typical “cover our
butts" U.S. military manner) brush

off Kovic’s fear that he killed a

fellow Marine. In reality, the
commander investigated the in-
cident and concluded that Kovic
did not kill the Marine.

    

  Pal
Kengor

Also, in the critical, emotional
scene which portrays the true
tragedy of the U.S. involvement
—— the feeling-it-at-home segment
— Kovic did not visit the dead
Marine’s family in Venus, Ga. In
fact, such a visit would've been
nearly impossible, considering
there is no Venus, Ga.

It also turns out that the scene
where Kovic, confined. to a
wheelchair, is bludgeoned by
riot-police clubs breaking up a
peaceful student strike at Syracuse
University, the incident which
probably best helps substantiate
Stone's “fascist” theory, is a fal-
lacy. Stone did have this scene
partially correct; there was a
student demonstration. However,

I the ‘protest. ended peacefully;

Syracuse police never even en-
tered campus, and, lo and be-
hold, Kovic wasn’t even there.
Furthermore, the scene at the
1972 Republican National Con-

. vention is also hogwash. Although

Ron Kovic did attend the conven-
tion in Miami, he was notspat on
nor clubbed. He was politely
wheeled out the door. And while
on the subject of conventions, it
turns that . Stone’s impressive

- research did enlighten us with

the fact that Kovic spoke at the
1976 Democratic National Con-
vention, but the film fails to
mention that it was to nominate a
Vietnam draft dodger who fled to
England. a
Additionally, Kovic’s high-
school wrestling coach insists he
never used the word “kill,” con-
trary to the movie's depiction of
him. Kovic never went to his
junior or senior prom. He never
spoke at a July 4 rally in his
hometown. His mother resents
being characterized as a fanatic.
And finally, none of the locals

recall any bashing of the Vietnam V

veteran in a barroom.

Stone piously told the LA. Times
that “I’m the biographer  I’m
obviously telling Ron’s story; I’m
not screwing with the facts." If
perjury were a criminal offense,
then Stone would face eternity in
prison. .

Given these facts, or lack
thereof, it’s no surprise that Stone
has commented, in his own
pseudo-intellectual, over-dra-

- matic way: “T he vandals are at

the gate. We have a fascist secu-
rity state running this country. 
Orwell did happen. But it’s so
subtle that no one noticed. If I
were George Bush, I’d shoot

myself. Existentially, there's no

hope. His soul is dead.” Far out,
man. I guess you have to under-
stand film to be able to compre-

hend such an in—depth analysis-
of contemporary American poli- .

tics.
On Monday, Stone was re-
warded for this piece of cine-

, matic debauchery with an Oscar
. for Best Director. Even more

ironically, his production was
awarded the Oscar for Best Edit-
ing — it seems that editing was
precisely what Born on theFourth
of July needed, and lots of it.
Stone’s movie provides young,
impressionable Americans with

his exaggerated and distorted -

perception of wartime America '
during the '60s. Worse yet, the
movie is supposed to be a true
story.

Janet Cooke, a reporter for the
Washington Post, won a Pulitzer
Prize for an outstanding story she
wrote about an 8-year-old heroin
addict. The only problem with
the story was that it was com-
pletely fabricated. The Pulitzer
committee reacted by taking away
Cooke’s award. The same should
be done to Stone; his Oscar should
be taken back.

Parking

ONE Per Customer. Expires April 4, 1990.

Continued from page I
Capri‘ Pizza on Forbes Avenue,
said that there is parking available

' in a private lot across the street

that his customers can use.

“In the lot across the street, [the
prices are] anywhere from $4 to
$5 an hour. Not many people are
willing to pay that just to come in
here to have lunch,’’ Hoss said.

Hoss said that his business still
does well because of the large
number of deliveries, but that
parking problems affect that side
of his business too.

“My delivery people run in and
out all the time to get pizzas.
Sometimes they’re just in here for
a second, and a cop will start
writing a ticket. Once they start
writing, they can’t stop, so we are
stuck with them," he said.

Pittsburgh Police and meter
maids aren’t the only ones who
give out tickets on campus. In the

past year, university enforcers,

have given out 8,735 tickets,
according to Janet Thomas,

“When people park in permit
spaces without a permit, we give
them a $25 ticket. We also can
give out Pennsylvania citations,
which run up to $32.50. We
sometimes do that for a constant
violator,” she said.

Thomas said that the internal
tickets that Pitt gives are enforced
by several follow-up letters. The
university can also tow a car with
several unpaid violations.

“We can tow, but that doesn’t
guarantee that the tickets will be
paid. We used to use the boot,
but we stopped about a year
ago,” shesaid.

“It doesn’t really affect us during
the day because the people who
come in for lunch are usually
already on campus, but at night it
is a real problem. When the meters
are filled, people are leery about
going to a public lot at night and
walking three or four blocks,”
she said.

Bankert said that she does try
to warn her customers about the
no-parking policy from 4 to 6
p.m. on Forbes Avenue. The
penalty for parkng there at that
time is $32.50.

“If we see someone going out
to feed the meter at that time, we
warn them about the ticket,” she
said.

Chris Reisz, assistant manager
at Puccini’s Hair Design, said that
she also does a little extra to help
her clients avoid parking tickets.

“If a customer is getting a perm
or something long like that, then
I’ll go out myself to put quarters
in for them so they won't get
tagged,” she said.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Hackett and v0nAppen ready to take the

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Paul Hackett, Pitt’s 30th head
football coach, and assistant coach
Fred VonAppen bring some
impressive credentials to their
new positions as spring practice
gets into full swing.

Prior to coming to Pitt, Hackett
spent eight years in the NFL
developing three outstanding
quarterbacks and instituting
offensive schemes around several
well—known offensive stars.

Hackett began his initial NFL
coaching experience as a

V quarterback coach in 1981-82
where he worked with Brian Sipe.

He spent the next three years
coaching the passing game of
today's four-time Super Bowl
champions, the San Francisco
49ers. During his reign with the
49ers, the team was 1983's NFC
West Champion, 1984 Super Bowl
Champion and 1985 playoff
participant. ,

He then moved to Dallas, where
he served as pass coordinator
from 1986-88 and worked with
Danny White and Herschel
Walker.

Hackett spent 11 years coaching
college football: two at California-
Davis (1970-71), four at California-
Berkeley (1972-75) and five at
the University of Southern
California (1976-80).

At USC, he coached Vince
Evans, the 1977 Rose Bowl Most

Valuable Player, and Paul
McDonald, who set 17 school,

PAC-10 and NCAA records.
During that time, the Trojans won
the 1979 National Championship,
the 1976, 1978 and 1979 Rose
Bowl games, and the 1977 Astro
Bluebonnet Bowl.

At Cal-Berkeley, he coached
Steve Bartkowski, the NCAA’s

also developed the late Joe Roth,
who led the PAC—8 in passing,
while directing the Bears to a
conference co-championship in
1975.

University President Wesley
Posvar said, “Paul Hackett’s
coaching philosophy, his
leadership style and his earnest
and enthusiastic pursuit of success
on the field are fully consistent
with the university’s
uncompromising commitment to
both athletic and academic
excellence.

“He brings to this task a
reputation for integrity, personal
concern for the welfare of players
and uncommon coaching skills
honed by years of experience.”

Pitt athletic director Edward
Bozik was also quick to
acknowledge the fact that Hackett
fit in well with Pitt’s schemes of
both academic and athletic
achievement.

_ “We were looking for a man
whose commitment to athletic
excellence was matched and
balanced by a similar commitment
to academic achievement for our
student athletes. Paul Hackett

professional football.

“He has prepared himself well
to be a head football coach. Paul’s
dedication to academic attainment
began in a family environment
where education was an integral
part of his formative years, and it
has continued through his adult
life,” Bozik said;

Assistant coach, defensive
coordinator and defensive—line
coach Fred VonAppen joined the
Pitt coaching staff in February. ,

VonAppen was in his third
coaching stint at Stanford, serving
as defensive coordinator and line
coach since March of 1989 before
joining the Panthers. He was an
assistant for San Francisco’s Bill
Walsh from 1983-88, the first four

years as special-tearns coach and ‘

the ﬁnal two as defensive-line
coach.

VonAppen spent two years as
defensive-line coach for the Green
Bay Packers (1979-80), five years
as assistant coach at Oregon and
two one-year stints at Arkansas.
He was also a defensive coach

under Tommy Prothro at UCLA V

in 1970 and offensive-line coach
under Charlie Coffey at Virginia
Tech in 1971.

A 1974 graduate of Linfield
College in McMinnville, Oregon,
where he earned a bachelor's
and master's degree, VonAppen
was an All-League selection in
football and played in the 1961
Carnelia Bowl. He coached on
the high school level from 1964-
66.

THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS, Thursday, March 29, 19905” 

 

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

The credentials of the ninth
hitter in the batting order are
normally a strong glove and a
weak bat.

Pitt freshman shortstop Ralph
McNelly doesn’t believe that to
be true.

As the season stands, McNelly,
with two home runs, shares the
team lead and is tied for second
in RBIs with five. By the way,
he leads the team with seven
errors.

So much for the strong-g1ove/
weak—bat theory.

The Panthers, including
McNelly, started off the Florida
trip strong on offense but fell
on hard times at the end, which

Shortstop McNelly proving himself

four hits today, and that’s going
to pick him up. Way up.”

Lewis said, “We try not to get
him excited. We try to keep
him low—keyed. I tell him that
every game is the same, as
every series is the same."

“If he gets too keyed, he’ll be
tight. At shortstop, he can’t be
tight. He needs soft hands to
field the ball and needs to be
able to make the throw [to
first]. If he is too excited, he
won’t have soft hands, and
he’ll have boards for arms.”

With his average at .212, his
run production is pretty
impressive.

continued into the Seton Hall
series last weekend.

McNelly’s offensive slump fell
to one for his last 16 before the
Duquesne Dukes so graciously
appeared at Trees Field
yesterday.

McNelly’s towering home run
in the third over the left—field
fence set the tone for the
Panthers’ shellacking of the
Dukes 23-3.

“After I hit the home run, it
sort of made me feel like I
could do just about anything. It
really boosted me up, and I got
a couple of hits after that.”

McNelly went four for five,
scored five runs and added
four RBIs.

“He is gradually feeling
confident,” said Lewis. “He had

As for this season, Lewis said
McNelly is the Panthers’
everyday starting shortstop.

and two Duquesne pitchers later,
the Panthers led 17-0.

Aiming for a Panther shutout
was Des Schnur. In his last start,
he walked five and surrendered
11 hits. This time out, he was on
top of his game.

“He stayed steady. His control
was off [in Florida], but he was
pitching pretty well,” said Vucci,
who was two for four with three
RBIs. “Today, he got his control
down, and now he is looking real
good.

“He threw the ball real well. He
placed his pitches where he
wanted. He would have done
real well against any team,” Vucci
said.

Lewis added, “He was on top
of the batters. He could stay ahead
[in the count] and use his off-
speed stuff. He has a nice breaking

ball, a good curve ball and a
good knuckle ball. He made the
batters fish [for the ball] today.”

Duquesne struggled to get one
run off Schnur in the seventh. A
single by Mario Cafaro, an error
by third baseman Brad Reese and
a sacrifice fly by Mike Bell
produced the run. For the day,
Schnur gave up five hits, one run
and struck out four to go with no
walks.

The massacre didn’t end there.
Four more Panther runs keyed by
a two—run single off the bat of
McNelly sent another Duke
pitcher to the showers.

“We did a great job of hitting
today,” said McNelly. “Everything
came in bunches.”

This was the most one—sided
victory for the Panthers since a
23-0 win in 1984.

At the start of the season, Pitt Coach Frank D’Amico wasn’t sure what his team was capable of
achieving. He had a group of mostly young and inexperienced gymnasts with only one returning
senior. He lost two of his top men from the previous year, including Jorge Gonzalez, a two-‘time

D’Amico accomplished that goal, but he was able to add many others to the list. At the National
Independent Championships on Saturday, Pitt scored a season-high 266.75 points, improving their
overall score by 21 points from their first meet in January. That score was the highest D’Amico had
seen in eight years.

“This is the first time I’ve had a team that’s been able to improve that much,” D’Amico said.

Psychedelic grunge rockers color Pittsburgh

on two compilations: “Last Days
of Rome,” on Tremor End of the
World-a-go-go (Tremor Records)

and “Love Gone Sour,” on It
Came from the Garage
Compilation (WangHead
Records).

With everything going so well,
no one expected the death of
Solo in an automobile accident
later in the year. Fans predicted
the end of The Colors, but the
band came through, recruited
Dave Sylvester to play bass and
began working on new material.

The Colors finally released their
first full—length LP, Malos Colores,
in 1987 on Poe Records. The
album helped the group get more
out-of-town shows, an important
aspect considering that at the
time, The Colors were banned
from playing at all but two of
Detroit’s clubs. (This was due to
certain “accidents” and
“misunderstandings” involving
certain pyrotechnic effects.)

Malos Colores established the

band as a standard rock ‘n’ roll
quartet that pushed their sound
to the fringes of hardcore thrash.
Lyrics like “My knife, your
daughter/My heart, for slaughter/
My life, no matter/Put the fire out
with cold water,” are prime
examples of the manic-
—-depressive songbook that The
Colors have created.

In December of 1989, The
Colors released their most
promising recording, Settling for
Less, a nine-song LP on New
York-based, independent Rage
Records. The album capitalizes
on the hard-driving style that The
Colors have based their talented,
often stand—-offish reputation on.

For now, The Colors are
concentrating their efforts on the
road in support of Settling for
Less. Live, these guys like to make
it as loud and as energetic as
possible. They’11 settle fornothing
less!

The Colors will be performing
at the Upstage Lounge tonight
along with the Pleasureheads.

————— --:—‘- 1

By Manny Theiner
Staff Writer

In this age of the couch potato
and the tofu burger, there are still
some people who live with a
sense of adventure. And this
weekend, the Big Adventure is
music.

Hungry “alternative music"
lovers who are tired of buying
corporate assembly—line tunes at
their local Wendy’s One Stop
Compact Disc and Urinalysis
Center might want to look into
Experimental Music Weekend for
a refreshing change —— it’s a two
day celebration of new sights
and sounds at the First Unitarian
Church in Shadyside,
conveniently located within 10
minutes of your house. And the
event is co-sponsored by the
Turmoil Room, a Wilkinsburg
gallery and performance space
that has been at the forefront of
avant—garde activities since the
Sonic Turmoil Festival last July.

The weekend begins on Friday ‘

with the performances of two
local groups. First, two audio
artists and filmmakers with the
imposing name of A Small Fish

0 Swimming In The Push And Coast

Mode (otherwise known as Pitt
students Michael Johnsen and
Kelly Stevens) take the stage.
Heaven knows what will
transpire. Then Pittsburgh’s
original underground
experimental ensemble, Morphic
Resonance, work their unique

continues the group’s six—year
tradition of excellence with the
help of Roger Dannenberg
(trumpet-triggered computer),
Peter Velekonja (Woodwinds) and
Dean Rubine on synthesizers and
weird spacy effects.

The Friday concert climaxes
with the highlight of Henry
Gwiazda, an experimental
guitarist from Minnesota.
Comparisons to Elliott Sharp are
rather valid, as he triggers a
constant stream of samples with
his six-string, creating a dense
environment of expressive sound
clusters and pieces with titles such
as jamdancmglileejazz.

Gwiazda is a music professor at
Moorhead University and has
released a piece on compact disc
by the prestigious Minnesota
Composers Forum. He’s a vibrant

Opportunity Knocks

By Rich Turgeon
Staff Writer

This Dana Carvey vehicle is so
predictable and unfunny it makes
one wonder if it was written by a
computer. Let’s see  4 ZANY
MISTAKEN IDENTITY SCENES, +

But, as we all know by now,
computer programs are known
to crash. Or in this case, crash_
and burn. The glitches in this
foolproof equation are numerous
and underscoredby an insulting
lack of originality and intelligence.

Carvey plays con artist Eddie
Farrell, mistakenly identiﬁed as a
Harvard—educated businessman
by his wealthy neighbors. From
the press kit: “It’s not long before
the CEO (played by Bigs Robert
Loggia) of a manufacturing
company takes a special interest
in Eddie and offers him a high-
powered marketing position with
the firm.” Is this beginning to
sound familiar?

First off, just because Dana
Carvey is one of the most talented
performers ever to grace the cast
of “Saturday Night Live” doesn’t
mean he can carry a feature film,
let alone act.

This transition from TV sketches
to feature films separates the
Victoria Jacksons from the Steve
and Carvey’s
performance as con artist Eddie
Farrell doesn’t come close to the
dazzling unpredictability of a star
like Eddie Murphy.

Director Donald Petrie
mistakenly believes that watching
Carvey do George Bush and lip-
synching to “Born to be Wild” is
worth exploiting for six bucks.
The fact that Carvey’s as dry as his
script only heightens the
appreciation one feels when he is
thrown into a situation forcing
him to deliver his Martin
Shortinesque schtick.

Most of the comedy is an
unintentional product of a number
of truly awful scenes with the

and intelligent performer, as eager
to explain the inner workings of
his instruments to audience

. members as he is to unleash a

torrent of sound.

The second day’s no slacker.
The Year Zero is a chamber group
(violin, two cellos, guitar,

‘ keyboards, drums) of Mt. Lebanon

High School students who
compose and arrange original
experimental music.

Besides performing, The Year
Zero is releasing its second
cassette titled 2 X Live, which
features selections from its
concerts at Chatham College and
WRCT, as well as new studio-
recorded surprises.

The Backyard Mechanics, a
performance—poetry band
featuring some of most active
people from the Cleveland avant-

garde scene, also appear on
Saturday.

This weekend’s spiel closes out
with a performance by
improvisational quartet Mothball.
Individually, the members of
Mothball have impressive solo
careers. For example, keyboardist
Charley Rowan and saxophonist
Jeffrey Morgan toured Europe
and various U.S. performance
spaces with the free—music
ensemble Clank.

Percussionist Murray Rearns has
figured prominently as Eugene
Chadbourne’s sideman and a
founding member of the industrial
tape—noise band Chuck, whose
album USA remains an
experimental classic of the ’80s.
Finally, bass clarinetist Paul
Hoskin has exercised his improv
chops with various notable

musicians from Seattle and New
York such as Jeff Greinke, Sue
Ann Harkey, Zeena Parkins and
Chris Cochrane.’

Mothball promises one huge
squonkfest of a finale, a ﬁtting
end to a weekend truly on the
cutting edge of sonic superlatives.
If you like your music meaty and
juicy, the Experimental Music
Weekend is as rare as it gets.

Yheﬁxperi mental Weekend will '

be held March 30 and 31 at the
First Unitarian Church,
Morewood and Ellsworth
Avenues, Shadyside. Both
concerts begin at 7:30 p.m. and
are open to all ages. Admission is

some ways, they are in their own
category entering the ’90s. It’s
called rock the way it was
supposed to be played. This is
not heavy metal, nor is it the
synth-ﬁlled dance music that has
a lock on the airwaves. This is
what you might expect to hear at
The Decade. Gritty, piercing,
down-and—dirty rock that Saturday
night was made for.

Especially catchy are “Twice as
Hard,” “Could I've Been So Blind,”
“Hard to Handle” and “Sister
Luck.” Make no mistake; this is a
guitar band, and there's no
skimping on the chords. Bassist
Johnny Colt and drummer Steve
Gorman set the stage for “the
singer” and “the guitars,” as the

liner notes call them. A little
honky—tonk piano gives some of
the tracks a Southern ﬂavor.

This release is an AOR radio-
station program director's dream.
It’s a shame there aren’t many left
to play it amid the Cure and New
Order.

recorded live in the Church of the
Holy Trinity in_ Toronto. Perhaps
it's just the acoustic differences
between a steepled church and a
box of a recording studio, but
The Caution Horses does not have
the overall impact of The Trinity
Session.

The music is the same although
a more lively percussion sound is
used on some tracks. And some
of the songs might have been
leftovers from the first recording
sessions, by the sound of them.
But The Trinity Session was
haunting, both lyrically and
musically. Everything fit perfectly,
from the undertoned vocals to
the mandolin to the subject matter.
While The Caution Horses has its

moments — the haunting and
appropriately named “Witches,”
“Where Are You Tonight” and a
remake of Neil Young's
“Powderﬁnger” — it seems the
four-person band is somewhat
intent on both maintaining
precisely the same arrangements
-as on the first release, while trying
to expand without abandoning
the style that is their trademark.
Those tracks that maintain the
originality of The Trinity Session
are wonderful. The others are
merely average or miss the mark,
especially “Rock and Bird.”
Margo Tirnmins’ soft vocals
guide the music through its paces.
It’s the type of voice that could
personify a soft, summer rain

shower, a rising sunset or the
death of a close friend. Quite
simply, it remains with you and is
not easy to forget. It is difficult to
find any band that can rninirnalize
itself so much and at the same
time create such a comprehensive
release; Timmins’ voice -is the
main reason for this. Michael
Timrnins’ songwriting is as sharp
as anyone’s, and his sublirnated,
melancholy guitar blends
perfectly with Margo’s voice to
create an aura of tranquility.

Those aspects are obvious on
both releases. But the ability to
follow up a dynamic debut is not
easy, as has been documented in
recent years. The Cowboyjunkies

Knocks

Continued from page 5
lifeless Carvey trying to woo the
CEO’s bleeding- heart daughter.
There's even a laughable “love
montage” straight out of The
Naked Gun.

The premise of Opportunity

’ Knocles might have shown
potential if it hadn’t been done
already in dozens of early ’80s
films such as Coming toAmerica,

 

Big, Trading Places, etc. This is a
ﬂick you probably wouldn’t hate
yourself for renting on video,
because (getting back to the
computer metaphor) it will
quickly be erased from memory.

It does have one or two
moments we haven't seen before,
but this crowd-pleasing drivel
lacks both wit and someone to
deliver it.

change behavior, develop a capacity for new relationships

and achieve a sense of self in deep and abiding ways. The

goals are not only to ease cramped life patterns and
remove symptoms, but also to expand the freedom to work
