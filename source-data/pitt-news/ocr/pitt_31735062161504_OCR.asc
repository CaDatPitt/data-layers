THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Commons Dance Will Have
Garden Lounge on Bigelow

A roof—garden-style lounge will be set up on the Bigelow porch for the formal
Commons Room Ball on June 8, with Claude Thornhill, his piano and his orchestra, fea-

I turing Christy Connors and the Snowﬂakes, providing the music.

The Ball is formal at the request of University officials, who granted permission for
the “birth of a tradition” dance only on that condition.

V Education

How to educate 300,000 special-
ists a year was the problem tossed
to- :1 Foster Hall audience this

morning, as Pitt's ﬁrst manpower
" conference got underway.

Conference sessions in Foster
Hall into the late afternoon pre-
sent top experts and discussion
leaders in an attempt to under-
stand and solve the nation’s and
h i g h e r education’s manpower
problems. .

Students and faculty are invited

 to all portions of the program ex-

Wolfle Speaks

Speakers this morning include
Dael L. Wolﬂe, director of _the
Commission on Human Resources
a n d
Dwight Chapman of the U. S. de-

\ tense department, who spoke on

“Military Requirements.”
Mr. Wolﬂe, the ﬁrst speaker.
‘made the estimate that 300,000 sci-
_.entists and specialists will be

,. needed each year by 1961. Accord-

ing to Mr. Wolﬂe, educational fa-
cilities are generally inadequate
at present to produce that number.
-‘ Afternoon sessions, under the
,heading “The Supply of Human
Resources,” will be concerned with
increasing facilities to supply the

- needed specialists.

At 2:15 p.m. Henry Chauncey,
president of the Educational Test-
ing Service, speaks on “Identiﬁca—
tion and Selection.”

Try_tten Discusses Policy

M. H. Trytten, director of the
National Research Council’s Of-
ﬁce of Scientiﬁc Personnel, will
follow Mr. Chauncey with an ad-
dress on “Present Resources and

Herman Levy, ticket chairman;
investigated the possibility of
getting reduced rates on rented
tuxedos and summer formals for
the men.

Tux Discount Out

He found no Pittsburgh com-
pany would grant a discount
since June weddings and many
school formals are giving them as
much business as they can han-
dle.

To encourage the practice of
trading dances with friends, a
custom prevalent at traditional
dances on many other campuses,
dance programs for the Commons
Room Ball will be made avail-
able in advance at the Student

Desk on Wednesdw, June 6, s

Anyone unable to pick up a

punched will be able to get a
program at the door.
Lounge Facilities Planned

Besides the “roof-garden” with
tables and overhead lanterns that
will be set up on the Bigelow
porch, the Blue Tuck Shop will
be open for refreshments, and the
second ﬂoor smoking rooms and
halls will be open for a strolling
view of the dancers through the
arches, according to the Ball
committee.

Tickets for the ball are avail-
able from any ticket salesman,
from the Cap-and-Gown strolling
salesman, or at the Student Desk
for $4.50.

Salary Issue
Unchanged as
Semester Ends

As the spring semester closes,

the faculty still remains unsure
about next year’s salaries and
teaching schedules. The recently
disclosed plan to eliminate over-
load teaching hours, and to raise
salaries a possible 10 per cent in
the fall, remains a possibility.
If overload is dropped, an esti-
mated 50 per cent of the faculty
now carrying extra hours stand to
lose up to 25 per cent of their total
take-home pay along with it.

The proposed 10 per cent raise
in salary remains dependent upon
the fall enrollment ﬁgures and an
increased appropriation for the
University from the State.

Faculty disapproval of the plan
has remained anonymous.

, In Great Debate
During the “great debate” now raging in the Senate Gen.

Bradley has stood by President Truman
ﬁring of General Douglas Mac-4,

Arthur. His ﬁrm stand behind
President Truman has brought on
strong Republican attack during
the Senate hearings.

Chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff since August, 1949, Gen.
Bradley will bring a distinguished
military record with him to Pitt.
He is 58 years old.

Rises Through Ranks

Graduated from West Point in
1915, Gen. Bradley took over his

It

ﬁrst command as a second lieuten-. A:  

ant in the same year. Since then
he has risen steadily through the
ranks. His career has culminated
in his appointment as ﬁrst chair-
man of the joint chiefs when the

services were combined under a
uniﬁed command in 1949.

During the last war, the general
served in campaigns in Tunis,
Sicily, Normandy, France, Bel-
gium, Holland, Luxembourg, and

four months ago in the name of
the professor of mathematics here
who died last November. . ‘

According to the fund commit-

tee, friends, faculty, and Dr. Cul- ,

already has $2000. With the money
the University will set up an en-
dowment fund from which the in-
terest will provide an annual
award.

Announcement of the ﬁrst award
will be made on Scholar’s Day
next year.

Checks should be made payable

Varied Agenda

Heading the agenda will be
election of a Publications Board
representative, budget reports,
and recommendations for next
year’s Pitt Chest Drive.

Jack Burwinkle will report on
plans to have women cheer lead-
ers.

The solons are expected to con-
sider proposals for increasing the
interest of students in the student
legislative body. Wecht says that
students neither know nor care
enough about the activities of
their only voice in the adminis-
tration of the University.

Part of the business of the meet-
ing will be to set dates for sum-
mer meetings on such programs

as train trips to football games,
Dad’s Day, high school/days, and
programs for large pep rallies.
Social Committee To Meet
The Student Congress‘ social
committee will also call a meeting
for the end of the semester or
early summer. at which, accord-
ing to Wecht, some representa-

tive of all campus social organiza-
tions should attend.

_Congress plans to revive some
discussion on the banning of li-
quor in Pitt Stadium during foot-
ball games. The drink ban, an
issue in Congress last fall, was
again upheld against ‘SC wishes
at that time.

A tentative proposal on the
Congress books is the establish-

ment of a new publication, a so-
cial handbook for students. An-
other publication of Congress, the
Servicemen’s Newsletter is to be
printed at least three times next
year, according to present plans.

Monday’s meeting will hear
rules concerning the use of Con-
gress’ recently purchased public
address system.

For Alumni Homecoming

The Spring Homecoming and Reunion this year will be

the “most colorful in 4 years,”

according to J. Clyde Barton, _

secretary of the General Alumni Association.
The Reunion is being held from June 9 to 12 this year.

Replacing the Smorgasbord, whiché It
u

has been a custom at the reunions
since 1948, will be a “Pow-Wow,”
at 5:30 pm. on June 12. Barbe-
cued beef, roasted over charcoal
ﬁres, will be prepared and served
on the Cathedral Lawn.

In case of rain all arrangements
have been made to move the whole
festival inside to the Commons
Room.

Invited To Pow Wow

All students have been invited
to attend the “Pow Wow,” as in
previous years. Tickets are avail-
able in most of the offices of the
schools, all dean's offices, the Stu-
dent Desk, and in the Alumni Of-
[ice at 3632 C1.

Barton emphasized the import-
ance of students, and especially
seniors, attending the banquet.

“The banquet also gives stu-
dents, their family and friends, a
chance to become acquainted with
the administration and the fac-

Umbrellas on Lawn

The lawn will be bright with the
blue and gold lawn umbrellas of
each school of the University. The
fraternities will also have vari-
ous colored lawn umbrellas. The
class of ’26 will wear special bean-
ies in honor of their silver anni-
versary and the ODK ushers will
wear blue and gold caps.

Barton suggested that tickets be
bought early, since the banquet
was a sell-out last,year. The at-

A NEWS PROMOTION

Almost every former mem-
ber of the NEWS staff has
succeeded in getting a job on

before graduation, declared
that “my experience on the
NEWS was the chief factor in

Times.”

of a series)
d to speak up on controversial

issues for fear of the red, pink, radical or even liberal label.
This was the opinion of numerous students and educa-
tors as revealed in a New York Times survey of 72 major

colleges.

Faculty members at the Uni-
versity of Utah said that “it’s like
pulling teeth” to arouse discussion.

Fear Burned Fingers

Dr. Harold Lenz of Queens Col-
lege said this reluctance was due
to student fear of “getting their
ﬁngers burned.”

Dr. Harold Taylor, president of
Sarah Lawrence College, com-
rnented, “Conservative students
usually respect the rights of polit-
ical radicals to express their views.
The trouble is that the liberal stu-
dents who are interested in polit-
ical and social reforms are so con-
scious of the dangers of being la-
beled pro-Communist . . . that
they do not wish to run that kind
of risk while they are still being
educated.”

Willingness Ebbs

One college paper examined the
prob1em~—in this manner: “The will-
ingness of instructors to express
their own honest viewpoint has
been slowly ebbing. Evidence . .
cannot be given in black and
white, it can only be felt in the
classroom.”

A number of educators queried 3

by the Times charged that the in-
creasing tendency to skirt current

issues has “struck a body-blow to
the American educational pro-
cess.”

Growing Resistance

However, they continued, it has
also given “a new impetus to a
small but growing resistance to
conformity and stimulated a new
appreciation of America’s free
heritage.”

The educators asserted that
students should challenge accept-
ed doctrines and ideas. They, said
the Times, argued that “the ex-

virtual ‘must"in today’s market
of conflicting ideologies.”

The general pattern the Times
found of fear, caution and inhi-
bition in student and faculty ex-
pression was, however, far from
complete.

Repression Fought

Examples of successful resist-
ance to repression, according to
the Times, were found at Chat-
tanooga, Johns Hopkins, North
Carolina, as well as other insti-
tutions.

“Many educational leaders,” the
Times concluded, “noted that if
better schools build better citi-
zens the struggle for freedom on
the campus and in the classroom
must be stepped up in this per-
iod of national mobilization.”

Men’s Council is going to throw its weight into the drive¢
to check Pitt’s shrinking enrollment.

According to MC President Jack Burwinkle, Council
plans to help the recruiting effort next semester by a stepped-

tute another goal of Council. Bur-
winkle said that MC would try to
get Pittsburgh disk jockeys to par-
ticipate in the dances and add
color to the affairs.

Council hopes to further the
program of the eighth ﬂoor men’s
lounge, but, Burwinkle said, this
depends on the revenue earned by
the MC bookstore next year.

The MC bookstore, located
on the eighth floor, will be
open for a few days at the end
of this semester to receive
books which students wish to

sell.

Another plan for next year is
to increase the number of show-
ings of football movies, shown
only one hour this year.

MC also approved nine of the
ten petitions submitted by candi-
dates for junior and senior col-
lege positions which were to be

ﬁlled by internal elections yes-
terday.
Burwinkle also released the

names of next year’s committee
chairmen chosen at a previous
meeting. They are: Phil Feinert,
mixer dance; Morton Goldstein,
bookstore; Jack Morgan, freshman
customs and traditions; Jack Wat-
kins, facilities; and Joe Rufﬁng,

When Pittypat, a part Dachshund, ﬁnally hit the 10-
pound mark, it was an occasion for a party at Pitt’s Addison
H. Gibson Research Laboratory.

Dogs have a special importance at the Laboratory at the

present time because their mainé

canines are the most useful ani-
mals for this type of work

Pittypat could never tip the

Finally horse meat was tried,
and this innovation brought Pitty-

Although she can’t be used for
any experiments, her place as a

Actually the dogs used by the

menu consists of Friskies, one

Dogs are used in preference to

Three Sources For Dogs

The Gibson laboratory gets its
dogs from three sources. About
80% are bred right in the labor-

This breeding is necessary be-
cause whole lines of dogs must
be observed rather than just one,
so that technicians can investi-
gate heredity implications of the

The Basenji has been called “a
living fossil” because it bears a

it has no bark. This last trait is
extremely valuable to a researcher

Last Deadline

It is with mixed emotions that I write
this last piece of editorial comment.

This should be the best example of my
writing to appear here, but I have never felt-
less inspired. So, with your permission, I’ll
just wander about a bit.

I won’t say I’m sorry to be leaving; in
spite of the fact that the next stop is Fort
Meade, I’m happy to be getting out of Pitt.
I have made many friends here, and many

people have been kind to me during my stay. .

The University has extended quite a sum in
ﬁnancial aid to me, even though its helping
hand got bitten editorially in return. Still,
I’m happy to be out, or on my way out.

I'm not on ﬁre about anything; I should
say something to the effect that the loyalty
oath and faculty raise issues shouldn’t die
out just because the News has quit publishing
for the summer, but I can’t. The spark isn’t
there; I’m not bitterly bitter about anything,
nor woefully sad, nor any great degree of
any emotion. It's been a long four years;
it’s been rough, it’s been fun, it’s been a’lit-
tle bit of everything, but it would be diffi-
cult for any four years to pass in one’s life
without having something of all life’s pains
and pleasures in it '

I’m certainly not looking forward to be-
ing drafted; but I’m not bitter, either. Maybe
I’ll save enough money to put a year in at
Columbia; if not, I’ll settle down to a $40—a-
week reporting job, and some day I’ll get
married. Maybe, before I’m 60,‘ I’ll get a
job as city editor somewhere and dig me a
nice little groove to last me until somebody
else digs me a nice little grave.

I’ll try to raise a couple of nice, decent

Letters To The Editors

Under the Barrel

Editor, \
Pitt News

I thought the Pitt News had reached the
bottom of the barrel when Mr. Markowitz
wrote his piece of nonsense about the loyalty
oath, but now I ﬁnd that the News barrel
must have a sub cellar. Your article, “Pitt
Beats Tech—at Last,” ﬁt very nicely into
the three columns allotted to it, and it indi-
cated also a well-lubricated imagination.

You have done some excellerit writing in
the past, Mr. Jensen, but your ast piece of
space-ﬁlling tripe was far below the level of
your ability and your integrity.

You say that Carnegie Tech’s ﬂoat parade
was “an out and outﬂop.” You say it was
“indicative of "Tech’s steady decline.”

In what hole were you hiding when a
terriﬁc rainstorm ruined some of Tech’s
ﬂoats and damaged many others. What would
our ﬂoats have looked like if they had been
subject to such a day of rain?

Out of desperation to ﬁll a column you
have stretched a non-existent point to a false
generalization. »You have demonstrated a
great deal of gall and a great lack of fairness
and integrity. ,

Leo Moss
Col. 52

Tech Facts Wrong
Editor,
Pitt News

Your May 16 issue contained an article
titled “Pitt Beats Tech—At Last” which
drew some interesting———and largely errone-
ous comparisons between Pitt and Carnegie
Tech.

I for one ﬁnd it hard to believe that “al-
most everyone seems agreed that Pitt’s ﬂoat
parade was far superior to the similar'ex-
travaganza concocted by our neighbors
across the valley . . .” Having had an op-
portunity to observe both parades, I am quite
certain that the author of the article in ques-
tion would have to eat crow if a more direct
comparison were available—even though
Tech was hampered by a steady rain during
the ﬂoat construction period.

The article also charges that Carnegie
Tech was unable to put on “worthwhile stu-
dent entertainment.” I assume that the
author has never heard of “Scotch and Soda”
—a nationally famous student organization
which writes, directs, and produces a com-
plete musical comedy each-year for Spring
Carnival. Every member of the cast is a
student.

A Other implications contained in the article
are hardly worth refuting. Any Pitt student
retreating to‘ the “backwash” of intellectual
activity over on Forbes Street” will soon ﬁnd
that Tech students are anything but “nar-
row specialists” who have never heard of the

A Fond Adieu

One of my critics in the Letters column
charges me with writing to ﬁll space. Today,
I confess to the crime, for I am doing just that.
So I would like to edge in a few words about
our graduating editors. /

If Dick Kovar does as \vell in the army as ‘
he did on the News he ought to be mustered
out a full general. If he is as honest as he was
here, he will most certainly come out a pri-
vate. "

Bob Newcomber has done a ﬁne job keep-
ing our books in the black. We hope we can
have steak at our banquet again next year.

Will Doerge worked more or less anony-
mously for three and a half years on the"
sports desk. When he got a chance to show
his stuff this spring, he convinced everyone
that the wait was not wasted.

Carol Frownfelter, in addition to being a
very pretty Festival Queen, is also a ﬁne art
editor. Few people are aware of the amount
of work she did when we were using the off-
set system.

All of us who remain here, will be remem-
bering what we learned from Kovar, New-p
comer, Doerge and Frownfelter for long after
they have gone. We hovpethat we can do as
well as they did. ' _- ED JENSEN .

Unless they turn in some exceptional performances, the

mond anniversary of the IC4A’s at Philadelphia today and

tomorrow.
It is the 75th consecutive

running of the IC4A’s. Coach

Roof Gets Waylaid
It was in the 1945 West Penn

- against John Lohstoeter—now his

teammate. As Jack recalls, “John
defeated me in three sets in the
semi-finals.”

Then, with a laugh, he adds,
“Since then, John has gone on

to the Nationals while I got .way- .

laid somewhere along the line.”

Incidentally, Roof doesn’t hesi-
tate to praise the smooth per-
formance of teammates Lohstoeter
and Harry Campney on the courts.
They’re both tops in his book.

Jack’s record this year shows a
6-4 mark in singles play and a
4-3 record in the doubles.

That’s pretty good considering
some of the circumstances he must
face daily. Roof commutes every-
day between Pitt and his home in
Latrobe. Despite this and 17 cred-

most 2.5 average.

In this Mud Bowl battle for

the hurling for the News.

However, it was hard to tell

playing for, as the Owl team
(augmented by the IM Buz-

runs in the ﬁrst.

The News’ team never could
catch up, as the teams slipped
and slopped in the mud. Gene
Weinstein and Will Doerge
had four for ﬁve in the losing
cause.

Mittmen Play
Last Home Foe

If the Pitt baseball team follows
the script again this afternoon, the
mittmen should easily defeat a
weak Western Reserve outﬁt when
the teams meet in a double-header
at Schenley Oval.

The Panthers have been able to
win against mediocre opposition
regularly but on the other hand,
have been easy pickings for the
better opponents that have taken
the ﬁeld against them.

Starting time for the ﬁrst tilt
is 1:30 p.m. Tuesday's game with
Washington & Jefferson was rain-
ed out.

With only three games remain-
ing on their schedule, the Pan-
thers—carrying a three game los-
ing streak—have a slim chance to
ﬁnish with a winning season.
Pitt’s record is 7-9.

Coach Ralph Mitterling’s Pan-
thers must face tough West Vir-
ginia in the season ﬁnale next
Saturday. Previously, the Moun-
taineers kayoed Pitt, 7-0, at the
Oval. .

Mitterling will throw southpaw
Ray Hollis (2-3) into the ﬁrst game
and finish up with either Paul
Lomond (2-2) or Bob Russel (3-4)
in the second game.

Senior outﬁelders Steve Pav-
lakovic, Bobby Lewis, Sam Sha-
piro, Nick Kostek_, and third-
baseman Joe Ross will appear on
the local baseball scene for the
last time today.

These isotopes—which serve as tracers-—
are used by Bell scientists to study the
materials that go into the telephone
system. Our research men, working with
Geiger counters, are able to detect

wear in relay contacts, impurities in metals,
the penetration of preservatives in wood.

This new research tool helps us to

learn more in less time, helps us to make
tclcphone equipment even more rugged
and dependable. That's especially important
right now when the Nation relies on

the telephone toihclp get things clone.

plant, preparing radioactive isotopes

for shipment to Bell Telephone Laboratories
and to other research centers.
