1917 Owl, Abounding in Pictures
and Other Features, Now
Ready for Initial Appearance.

Until latter Part of Week.

 

Bigger, better, more artistic than
ever before, the 1917 Owl appeared on
the campus today, two weeks earlier
than any Pitt annual has ever appeared
before. Bound in the best; grade of
leather, ﬁlled with the clearest cuts
that money could buy, abounding with
interesting group pictures of college
life, containing over 600 individual pic-
tures of Juniors and men who partici-
pated in athletics and other activities,
containing an athletic section unique

' in college annual circles, having seven

colored inserts that lend distinctive-
ness to the publication, introducing in
its pagesthe newest ideas in the art
of printing, the Year Book this year
far surpasses any that has ever been
issued at the University before, and
places Pitt on an equal Standing With
the other big institutions of the coun-
try that ‘issue such books._ In brief,
this year’s Owl is one of which the
University can well be proud. f01' I1_0
expense has been spared M “iake this
year’s book comparable to the ones
issued at Cornell and Pennsylvania.
As to the result, the book speaks for
itself. « _
The books are today being distribut-
ed in the Schools of Dentistry and
Pharmacy. This has been found neces-
sary as those schools will close at the
end of this week and the students are
anxious to get them before they leave
for their homes. It would have been
possible to have distributed them
among the under-graduate schools ‘but
if the books are left in the binding-
press a few days longer it will remove
any possibility of any loosing 01’ the

Edward A. Woods, class of '83, son
of former Chancellor VVoods of Pitt
and president of the National Associa-

weekly convocation on “The Inﬂuence

He began with an explanation of a

that at the age of 75, 63 have died, 3

dependent on charity.

“You students”, said Mr. Woods, “de-
serve credit for coming to this Uni-
versity for an education instead of do-
ing the easier thing and going to work.
It is also far easier to spend money
than to save it, and the secret of the
success in life depends on your ability
to save money.”

Quoting Jame-s J. Hill, he said: “ ‘If
you want to know whether you are
destined to be a success or not, you
can easily ﬁnd out. The test is sim-
ple and infal1ible.- Are you able to
save money? If not, drop out. You
will lose. You may think not, but you

SCIENTIST T0 SPEAK  

 

 

Dr. L. K. ‘Baekeland, Noted
Chemist, Inventor of Bakelite
and Velox Paper, Chosen.

The administration has chosen, as
Commencement speaker, .Dr. Leo.
Kendrik Baekeland a distinguished
scientist famous for his work in the
ﬁelds of photography, ‘ele-ctro-chem-
estry, and plasrtics. He has received
many recognitions of his endeavors,
among them the Perkins Medal for
1916 from the Afﬁliated Chemical and
Electrochemical A-Socities of. America,
an appreciation awarded for work
that has showed its commercial value
to society by the importance of in-
dustrial results.

Dr. Baekeland was born in Ghent
in 1863. He was educated in the uni-
versities of Europe and for a time was
a. professor in the University of Ghent.
He has supported himself since he
was -seventeen.

After, coming to America in .1889

Dr. Baekeland invented a. photogra-
phic paper, Velox, which was later,
sold for a million dollars. This en-

abled him to devote his entire time to
chemical research without any thought
of making a living.

Another of Dr. Baekelan-'l‘s discov-
eries is Bakelite, a substitute for am-
ber.

purposes. It also is used for making
buttons, billiard balls, phonograph
records, switchboards for battleships,
armatures and comutators for dyna-
mos and motors, telephone receivers,
railroad signals, grinding wheels,
handles for umbrellas, cigar holders,
p.ipe stems and articles of ornament.

Dr. Baekel.and is a member of the
Naval Reserve Board recently ap-
pointed by Secretary Josephus Dan-
iels.

The class of 1915 of the Dental School, along with the other,
departments of that class, is scheduled for a reunion, Commencement
Day, June 14th, 1916. .Many of the alumni of this class will be unable,
to leave their patients during the day, but in the eveninga banquet
is to be held at the Hotel Schenley
get’ in for this andliihave reserved tables. A

This, to the writer’s ‘mind, should be quite an attractive and
proﬁtable arrangement, ‘as we all can get together and learn What?
the other fellow has been doing since Junega year ago, and at the
same time enjoy the general Pitt spirit which always accompanie
such affairs. it Some men consider; it a privilege to attend‘ the general‘ ’
banquet. and others a duty. It is really both, but-to this class it will
also be a proﬁtable investment if we have a good turn out, as we

“Every one of you ought to keep an
expense account of your day’s ex-
penditures. I know that is a hard
thing to do, but the result will be a’
great beneﬁt to you. Another wise
thing to do is to make a deﬁnite plan
what you will do with your money.
Make this Plan and try to stick to it.
Most of you will know when you start
out in life just what your income will
be. You ought to plan ahead just
how you will spend it. Thrift is look-
ing ahead. The (favorite American
way to save money is through a life
insurance policy. This has the advan-
tage over the savings bank in that
-the tendency of t-he person saving in
a bank is to draw out his money again
and probably stop saving altogether.
With a policy he feels bound to make
the payments and receives notices if
he fails to do so. Life insurance is
the putting of a value on your -lives.
Every one, of you represents an in-
vestment of a certain amount ‘of
money. It is up to every one of you
to return to society that which has
been invested in you.”

-- That much -of Germany’s success in
the present European strife was. due
to the fact that she was prepared
along industrial lines as well as in a
military way, was the statement of Dr.
J. T. Holdsworth, dean. of the School
of Economics of the University of
Pittsburgh at» the luncheon of the
Pittsburgh Credit Men’s Association in
the Fort Pitt Hotel yesterday.
He further said that Eng1and’s poor
showing had not been due to military
unpreparedness, but to the fact that
she was not ready for battle industri-
ally. ’ , » -

Dr. Holdsworth declared that Amer-
ica not only should mobilize her army,
but her industries as well. The war
orders America is receiving are legiti-
mate, he said. Going further, Dr.
Holdsworth stated that the shackles
must be taken off big business, if we
are to compete with the rest of the
world, and that {industrial disputes

_ With each day new arrangements
are being made for‘ the May Day
Celebration which from the present
outlook promises to be one of the
most brilliant aﬂairs of the school
year. The committees are very busy
choosing and arranging the festive
dances in which all the girls are to
participate. Alllparts are to be as-
signed by the end of the _week,‘and
it is hoped that the participants will
appear regularly at the rehearsals,
for the occasion can only be made a
success by such a spirit.

The date has not yet been fully de-
cided upon but it is generally thought
that the festival will take place about
the last week in May or the ﬂrst Week
in June. However, the festival ishto
be an annual affair, held on the same
date and will probably be given some
such name as “Spri_nggFestival.”

It has beenglearned recently that the
girls at the Pennsylvania College for
Women, who are also holding a. May
Festival, are offering a program with
features very similar to ours. This is
merely a coincidence and shouldnot be

misconstrued. A

time.the*Carnegie...boys showed us at
the smoker last week -it sure Isa‘
shame to do -whatgwe will do. Outside
of a chance in the hurdles and the
shot-put, we can’t seehow Pitt can
lose at first. Still-* with such men as
Hemman,-‘Smith, Adams, Reiser and a
few others pitted against them, the
Gold and -Blue runners will have to
perform at their best.

aggregation are more optimistic than
they have ever been in the past. The
defeat handed out to our team by the
Syracuse crowd has not been forgot-
ten, but the Pittites remember the
more recent occurrence of last week
when the Plaid instiitutionwas over-
whelmed by the lop-sided score of over
3 to 1. Theshowing of Burwlell marks
him as a hard man for even the star
sprinters from Center County, and you
can rest assured. that if the Wa.shing-

ton speed boy is in the shape he was
last week, he will Walk away withpboth

the dashes and do them both in record ‘T

time. Albright, Walker, Mays and
Canan all covered the 440 Saturday
under 5.2 and. should be able to do bet-
ter this week. Then Albrig-ht may be
entered in this ‘event and if he is, it
will give localsport enthusiasts a.
chance to see what thexslight runner
can do at this distance. In the Penn

relays he was unoﬁicially timed in 51,

care of with Grumbling, Eckhardt and

stiffest competition of the year, but if

this event. Livermore ‘and Wiegel be-
tween them are two of the best two-

milers in the state and one of them.

should be able to break the tape in
the van. For the other track events
we have Jorden,’ Miller, 0 Hastings,

formers. ‘Added to these we must not '

though only recently recovered from

condition, he should be responsible for

j some of the total x-points that the Gold
and Blue will run up. D

It ‘is in the «ﬁeld events that Coach
Kerr’s proteges should make their best

showing. Sutherland took three ﬁrstsi

a strong bid ‘for honors" again. Fry

again and it looks as if he would be
