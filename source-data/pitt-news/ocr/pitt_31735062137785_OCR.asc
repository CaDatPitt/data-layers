While- the Pittsburgh ’Varsity
football training quarters have been
 open for two weeks and daily prac-
_tice has been held at Schenley oval,
it is still diﬁicult to make any def-

inite .-predictions as to the strength .

look is bright_with 10 of last year’s

._letter men back and 20 or more

likely ‘looking candidates working
hard. for the coveted positions left
vacant. _.
The schedule for the coming year
is the hardest ever faced by a Pitt
team and ‘great praise is due Grad-
ifuate Manager Hurst for his fore-
sight and labor in’ arranging it. A
hfgood" idea of the relative strength
of the “Big Four” and other strong
Eastern elevens and Pittsburgh can
‘be gotten from the games with Cor»

Mr. Boggs 13, president of the
Pitt Y. M. c. A., has given to.the
Pitt Weekly‘the following report of
his trip to Northﬁeld: ’

Seeing is believing is an old say-
ing, which is entirely true of North-
ﬁeld, for unless you have been there
and have seen it you cannot realize

what Northﬁeld is and what -North-

one-half mile from the boundary_ of

I ‘with a brief"outline of the several

divisions" and departments‘ of mod-
ern newspaper organization. The
two grand divisions are the busi-
ness and editorial departments. Un-
der the former come advertising, in-
cludng domesic and foreign, display
and classiﬁed; circulation, including

shipping, mail list and circulation
promoting; accounting and book-
keeping; and plant administration,

under‘ which head come the ;mechan-;*

ical departments, such as engrav-
ing, including line._and half-tone
work; composing, including linotype
battery, “ad” alley, “head” Talley,
proof reading. and makeup; stereo-
type, including matrix. and mate
making, routing and job work; elec-
tro-plating; press room; supplies,
pper, ink, etc. The editorial depart-

ment is sub-divided into these de-

partments: news, editorial writing,
art, "Sunday, features, reference (or
morgue). ‘The news department is
again divided into two departments
—~telegraphic and local, the former
including such news as is received
‘by ‘telegraph from special’ corre-
spondents, Associated Press, United.

»Pr‘ess7, International News Service

and other news agencies. Under the
"local department comes the general

"supervision of gathering local news,_

ing" news, including professional and
amateur sports, racing, tennis, golf,

A brief

the" departments in order to show
the’ relation of each to the process

of-"publishing the great daily news-

parier. _ .
-Prompted by several inquiries, the

‘instructor said that the newspaper

writer is, after all, one of the most

‘ poorly paid persons in any of the

professions, but that the most im-
portant -consideration lies not so
much in the monetary remuneration

as in the opportunities offered, for

public service,‘which, it was shown,
are greater in this ﬁeld than in
any other business or profession.

It was stated that the course
would be practical above every-
thing ‘else. ' Conditions will be taken
as they are and no time lost in the-
orizing and d/ebafing what news-
papers should or should not be. Lec-
tures will be given during the year
by‘ the best known inewspapermen

 of the city, and the course promises
* to be of ‘extraordinary value even

to those who do not contemplate
engaging in newspaper work, but
who desire to gain a broader, more
accurate and deﬁnite understanding
of the agency “that rules the land
through the public opinion it evokes
and “shapes.”

‘Following the preliminary lecture,
practical "exercises in writing news
paragraphs were engaged in by the
class. Facts were given by the in-
structor in fragmentary form, such
as" they ‘come to the reporter, and

then the class was asked to write

them as the reporter does in the
newspaper office. Then the Work of
the student was read and criticised.
In many instances the facts’ given
were taken from the daily paper,
and in these cases the student was
shown éthe printed paragraph with
which to compare his efforts. J
The style that is peculiar to news-
paper writing was emphasized, and
copies of the style book of one of
the large dailies of the city were
distributed to members of the class
for study and future reference. Dur-
ing the course of the year the class
will visit the various large news-
papers of the city. V '
Announcement was made that the

meet ’ of the ciaﬁsrjgnext Monday
evening is “News.” Preliminary to
the regular instruction, the manag-
ing editor of one of the local news-
papers will lecture before the class
on “What Is News?"

that there is a scarcity of chemists.

Vindication in Order

T HE candidacy of Jacob Soﬁe] will attract thousands of people who be-
lieve that Mr. Soffel received most outrageous treatment during the

' . recent graft prosecution in the arrest
to which he was subject. That it was
persecution was certiﬁed to by the
Grand Jury which exonerated him
from any connection whatever with
the orgy of iniquity which prevailed
in councilmanic circles when he was a
member of that body. Jacob Soﬂe1’s
record entitles -him, to wide and popu-

and inasmuch as he has been vindi-
cated by a regularly constituted legal
body, .a clean bill of health is now in

o-rderipfrom the voters of the city of
Pittsburgh. ' A ' ~
A clean man morally, Mr. Soifel

combines a knowledge of the needs of
the city in general with an extraordin-
arily keen business acumen. Successful
in large affairs, broad in his vision of
the rights of the taxpayers and in sym-
pathy with the toiling ‘ masses from

devotion to, hard won- and superior
' mental equipment,

serves to be one of the nine councilmengof the city of Pittsburgh, and in
order to make him so, his friends, who are legion, will work laboriously.

Class Rivalry.

Much comment has been aroused
recently concerning the rivalry be-
The
prevailing sentiment seems to be
that all such: rivalry should be con-
ﬁned to the campus, or at least its
near vicinity. In a large business
‘center such as Pittsburgh the actions

dents. Whatever rivalry between
classes we have should, be conﬁned
almost entirely to the campus. Such
restriction “need notaffect the inten-
sity of class feeling or actions in
the ‘slightest degree. In fact it
should increase such feeling. But
to carry our "class ﬁghts beyond our
own district will react upon the
school in the most" adverse manner.

Our Anniversary Year.

We are celebrating the one hun-
dred and twenty-ﬁfth anniversary of
the founding of the University of
Pittsburgh by enrolling the largest
Freshn3.e.n class in our history. It
is a ‘ting tribute _to the greatness
of our school that our enrollment
this year should be almost double
that of any other year.
increase in student attendance comes
increase in our
faculty. Then there are also two
buildings in course of construction
on the campus, the boulevard up our
hill is being rapidly completed“ and
p1ans_for new buildings are being
formed. In students, faculty and
equipment we are making a wonder-
ful growth.

To faculty, students and alumni
is this growth due. ‘During the last
few years all have exerted every
power in behalf of our school. Now
the results can be seen. If with but
little encouragement so much has
been done, what will not come from
theienthusiasm such success will en-
gender? An even greater growth in
the future must be the result.

With this growth must come a
change in the traditions which our
great ,body,‘of alumni laid down for.
us. New customs ' must now V be
formed. Ours will be the duties of
enlarging and perpetuating those
which our alumni so wisely started.
As new conditions arise in our Uni-
versity new laws must be laid down
In this important
work the student senate will take a
large part.‘ If it is to fulﬁll its
proper duties it ‘_must prove an effi-
cient and wise, organization. It will
need the support of_ alumni and stu-
dents alike. Then we will make this
anniversary year notable through
advance not only in,numbers, but
also along all lines of student and
alumni activity.

The Cornell Trip. .

As announced elsewhere in this
issue, one of our football games will
take place “at Ithaca with Cornell.
Our football manager is securing
special rates for all who can attend
this game. Every man who can
should go to Cornell to help Pitt
win. For we -are going to win if the
students do their share. .Let us
back our team up with a crowd of
loyal Pitt rooters. All who have
gone on these trips in the past know
that it will be a most proﬁtable in-
vestment. And let us show the peo-
ple what we can do. Every man
must make his cry--in place of a

SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS

Begins Year With Big Enrollment.

The School of Economics began its
second year with a very gratifying
increase in the enrollment. At the
close of the Spring term last year
were 18 Freshmen on the
rolls; the present term opens with
40 Freshmen, and the enrollment is
likely’ to7 exceed 50, before the end
of7 the week. About 20 students
from other colleges and universities
have been admitted to the Sopho-
more and Junior classes. The total
will probably double
that of last year. ' ’
The faculty has been greatly
strengthened, each department be-
ing in charge of a. specialist who
gives his entire timeto the work,
Mr. Ira. G. Flocken will be in charge
of the courses in industry and ac-
counting. Tivo accounting" courses
will be given this year, the intro-
ductory course to Freshmen and an
advanced course to Sophomores and
upper class men. A H

Dr. Thomas W. B. Crafer will
give all the work in sociology, and
will have some classes in economics.
Dr. Francis Newton Thorpe, noted
the world over for his writings on
constitutional history and law, will
have charge of the courses in politics
and constitutional history. Other
new faculty members who will give
courses for students in the School

man, F. B. Crandallﬂ in French and

Unusual interest is being taken in
the new course in journalism which
will be given" this year on Monday
evenings‘ in the Evening School.
This course will‘ be conducted in
close co-operation with the news-
paper opportunities for journalistic
careers. The course is open to day
students who are qualiﬁed to carry
the work. v

TEACHER’S COLLEGE STARTS.

 

The initial registration of the
School of Education Friday and Sat-
urday of last week exceeded all ex-
pectations. The enrollment at the
present riting is as follows:

Freshmen . . . . . . . . . . . 15
Sophomores . . . . . . . . . . 12
Juniors . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4
Seniors . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4
Special Students . 25
'Graduates . . . . . . . . . . . 10

There is a probability that there
will be additions Within the next few
days -to all of these classes. The
registration for the evening and
Saturday courses will not be com-
pleted before the end of ne t week,
but corr_es_pon«lence and .ervie-ws
up to date indicate that this enroll-
ment ‘will exceed all,p:-ist records—
probably approaching 100.

One of the innovations of the
year of the School of Education is

» without
spiritual support which he needs in ’

the Saturday class for the training
of teachers. The new school code
past by the last Legislature has es-
tablisht provisions for the certiﬁca-
tion and promotion of teachers,

‘which will grately stimulate this

work in the School of Education.
In order to make it easy for the
teachers of the Pittsburgh district
to prepare for the annual examina-
tions in various departments, this
special course was establisht and
placed under the directorship of
Prof. H. E. Winner, district principal
of the Howard Public Schools,_ and
for the past two years a member of
the Summer Faculty. The work of
the course began September 16th,
and‘ the enrollment has already

reacht 144, with prospects of further.
Considering the splendid ‘

additions.
enrollment of the Summer Term and

the high grade of work done by the it

students, the prospects for profes-
sional advancement in Western
Pennsylvania are certainly bright.
One hundred and -fourteen teachers

were registered in the Summer
School of Education, 40 of them
having ,receivd Brashear Scholar-

ships.
dents from 11 counties in Pennsyl-
vania as well as" from two other
States.

A matter of.unusual importance.

for the entire University, which will
be understhe special direction of the
School’ of Education, is the Second
Annual Conference of the Colleges

CALL FOR MEMBERS
A OF THE Y. M. C’. A.

The cabinet of the Y. M. C. A. '

are planning for»a vigorous and up-
lifting campaign among the stu-
dents of the "University of Pittsburgh
and for that reason they request
the support of all the students. The
Y. M. C. A. should be an important
factor in University life and no
Christian student, or any student
for that matter, can afford to "go
through college without being a
member of this organization and
receiving the moral and

order to develop uniformly. For
this reason all students -desiring to

join the_Y. M. C. A.——an.d on ac-'

count of the large increase in the
number of students attending, the
Y. M. C. A.. cabinet may not be
able at once (.0 speak to all the new
men—-will hand their names to any
one of the cabinet, a list of whom
are given below.

Boggs, president.

Allison, secretary.

Three 1.00-yard dashes Were‘ also
pulled off on this stage. The time
was somewhat slow owing to the
presence of a nu-mber of co-eds. The
official time was not announced. The
spectators kept crowding the course,
which also hampered the progress of
the contestants. ~

Then came an inspection of the
campus by the ,Fresh under the
personal supervision of the Sophs,
who warned" them to keep off the
grass. This over they proceeded to
the medical to- be dissected. A
number of pallbearers carried a
hearse, which contained the remains
of their childhood days. Arriving
at the medical‘ school the Sophs
formally presented the Fresh to the
‘dissection lab. The medicsreadily
accepted them. They said they
would be easy to work on. How-
ever, the Sophs’ joy was shortlived.
A prof appeared and stated that the
vmedical school could not possibly
accept the well-meant gift because
u the brain cells in a Freshman were
never known to be fully developed.

The Fresh were now led back to
the school of engineering and made
to bow to the fair -co-eds. The

Football Prospects Bright

Continued from Page i

victorious march in 1911, as she‘

has neither lost a large number of
veterans nor suﬂered from the above
mentioned fatality. For our ﬁne
schedule we owe thanks to Manager
Hurst, the Athletic committee and
several of our enthusiastic alumni,
who are often at the bottom of
things, but otherwise are not much
in evidence.

There have been a few changes
in the rules for this year, but noth-
ingradical has been adopted. Last
year Coach Thompson developed an

Vimpregnable defense and an oﬁense

that crumbled all opposition. With
another year to perfect this machine
it is concededpby many of the jubi-

.lant ‘ones that the 1911 team will

even surpass that of 1910, and even

‘the pessimistic ones say “Wait and

see!” The chief change made was

 regard to the forward pass,

which carried too many restrictions

last year to be anything but a safe

play. There will be no penalty for

an incomplete pass this year except

that one down shall be lost, the dis-
tance to be gained being the same
and the ball to be put in play at the
same point as the.‘down in which
the incomplete pass was made. ‘In
order to encourage accuracy in
passing and handling the forward
pass, a rule has been made that de-

clares a pass incomplete if it touches

the ground, even if it has been pre-
viously touched by a player of eith-
er side; - The period between the
ﬁrt and second and third and
fourth quarters has been shortened,
only enough time being" allowed to
change goals. ‘This prevents the
players from becoming ‘cold and

stiffened by the respite previously

allowed. . . .

again donned’ ‘the moleskins iaréz"

Viih. George A ‘Brown, _“Tillie’f _. Dewar,“

‘ﬁgeuggiei’ Blair," Quailey, Stevenson,
Wiagner, 'Geh-lert” and ‘Feightner;
Other last -» year men are Haslett,
Davis, Ashe, McEllroy. Among the
new men are Kernahan, Connelly,
Kerr, Pratt, iMarkle, Campbell,
Leitch, _So1es, McVehiel,,Smith and
O’Donnell.

‘Captain Jack Lindsay, of Johns-
town, has played a consistent game
at end for three years and is a dead-

, ly tackler, handles the forward pass

well. and‘ may always be depended
upon to doahis best in a pinch. He

«is not a heavy. man, but wiry and
‘ 2 fast, and is in the best shape pos-

sible. "‘Polly” Galvin received hon-
orable’ mention in Walter Camp’s
article on an All-American team
and it is predicted by many of the
wise ones that his name will appear
ﬁrst on the list this year. He did
the puntin_g in the State game last
year and will probably do so again,
as he has rare ability for distance
and gets his kicks oft well. George

/Brown spent the summer on a farm

near Hogdenville, 0., and may be
depended on to play his same steady
game at halfback. He is a splendid
defensive player and is hard to stop

when carrying the ball. If Blair
develops sufficient speed, it isprob-
able that he will be shifted‘ to tackle
to strengthen the lift side of the
line, as graduation has taken Bailey
and Dallenbach has received a fel-
lowship at Cornell—-he would not
have been eligible here, however,
under the new rules. “Ti11ie” De-
war will be seen back’ at quarter and
will direct the attack in his aggres-
sive and heady manner, ﬁnding the
weak spots and knowing when to
take a chance with a ‘trick play.
Quailey, the Dennison (Q.) lad is
a hard worker and _will probably
make the ’Varsity this year. While
Stevenson is late in reporting this
year,  _is said he is in splendid
shape. Wagner, who carried over
one of State’s ionside ‘kicks last
Thanksgiving and played in several
games at end, will be tried out in
the backﬁeld and it is "thought he
will ﬁll Captain “Tex” >Richards’
shoes. George Gehlert an_d Feight-
ner played tackle last year and will
probably be of great value this year.
Feightner is a strong defensive
player and may be used in the back
ﬁeld this fall. Among the new
linemen, Williams and Pratt look
good, the former is a Tome Institute

.man aﬂd the latter a Sophomore in

the‘ school of engineering; both men

"tip the beam at over 200 pounds.

“Chuck” Soles, the McKeesport
player; Kernahan, of Homestead,
and Connelly are showing up well
in the backﬁeld .and will all make
a strong bid for positions.‘ Walt
Campbell, the 1912 basket ball lead-

er,» and Davis, the track sprinter‘, ‘

are also doing well in, the backﬁeld.
Ashe " and !Mc’Ellroy. were on last
year's squad and are trying for line
positions.’ 9 Markle, Leitch, ‘Haslett,
McVehei1, Markle and Kerr are
working for positions. Two late ar-
rivals are Smith, of Bellefonte Acad-
emy, and O’Donne1l, of Kutztown

Freshmen had to be taken from their
houses and one was even awakened
from his restful slumbers and torn,
half awake, from his bed.» ,

V Then the real work of the even-
ing was begun. . Each squad took
three Freshmen, one to carry the
paste bucket, one to carry the post-
ers and one to carry the brush and
paste the posters up.

First the -campus was attended to,
a very good job being performed.
The posters were put up in every
prominent spot which was accessi-
ble.

While one squad was attending to
this the remaining. squads went
around to other places in the vicin-
ity and performed a like duty.

» The Freshmen at ﬁrst seemed
very reluctant to post the beautiful
and expressive tributes to their class,
but after two of their number had
been treated to a nice little “des-
sert” of soft, paste they concluded
that wisdom was the better part of
valor and, very wisely, did as they
were directed to do. 9

‘Conference
(Continued from page 1)
hour train ride, I arrived at South

Vernon, the railroad stop for North-
ﬁeld, at 4 o‘clock one afternoon last
June; thence by carriage over the
river and up around winding. roads
to the real Northﬁeld.

As’I was about to enter Marquand
Hall, where‘ I roomed during my
stay, there came this yell from the

campus below: “Rah! Rah! Rah!
Brown! Brown! Brown! Then Rah!
Rah! Rah! Dartmouth! Dartmouth!

Dartmouth I hastened to the rescue
and found the gamebetween these
teams had just ﬁ1‘1ished——but which
had won I cannot now remember.

As I stood watching the crowd on
student
State secretary of Pennsylvania‘,
came up and asked me to play for
his All-Pennsylvania team. After
this game I went in and got ready
for supper.  _

Now you fellows who have never
had supper at Northﬁeld have
missed something--not only in the
eating line, but in school spirit and
good-fellowship. I thought I knew
a little about school spirit when
we used to celebrate victories at
Kiski and Pitt‘; but I found I didn't
know anything at all. All during

supper there was never a lull in

the cheering. Every delegation
cheered every other delegation and
then did it all over again to be

‘sure. they hadn't missed anyone:

Thus it was every meal and, believe
me, it aids digestion.

The system of Northﬁeld is, gen-
erally speaking, this: the morning
is devoted to normal classes on va-
rious branches of Y. M. C. A. work,
under the direction of able men;
the afternoon" islgiven over to rec-
reation of all sorts; at 7 there is

ca.‘ meeting on “Little Round Top,f’

and: at. ._8 la. -,meeting in the Audi-

‘ toriurn‘. <~ V ' "
‘ : .Just"_,fa“word abo.ut.,“.Little. Round.

Top.”' It is. a small knoll‘ which
is’ east a little "distance from the
main campus, and high enough to
give you aview as far as eye will
carry in every direction. As you
sit up there at sunset, as you join
with ﬁve or six hundred others in
singing, as you listen to some such
man as Robert E. Spear speak,'you

have a feeling and a thrill that is

beyond words to describe—as near
as I can describe, it is a feeling that
you are glad you are living, that
you want to live Ihore for others
than your own self and you want
to come back next year to North-
ﬁeld. ’

There were many and excellent
speakers at Northﬁeld, but none
made the impression that Robert E.
Spear made. He did not come until
near the close of the confernce, and
for days _I heard the fellows talk-
ing of this man, and when Ivheard
him I knew why the fellows talked
so much. A man he is from the
ground up, and when he ‘speaks you
listen more closely than you have
ever done before, perhaps; and
when he has speken enough to get
a little warmed up you are listen-

iular evening exercises.

ing more attentively even than when
he started; and then when he dou-
bles up his ﬁst and shakes it at
you, you know you are listening to
Robert E. Spear; that there is only
one Robert E. Spear, and outside of
that you don’t know a thing. Per-
haps he starts at 8:15‘ and when
he stops your watch points 10, and
you want to ﬁnd out what 'makes
your watch run so fast, for you
could take an oath he was talking
only a few minutes. It costs ﬁfty

dollars from Pittsburgh to the con-

ference and back, but it is worth

twice that much for a chance to

meet such a man. as Spear. ' .
The one great affair at Northﬁel

outside of the regular program is

the‘ .annual celebration of “stunt”
night. It starts in the auditorium
and ends in a great bonﬁre on the
campus. i
All the various delegations on
this night are dressed up in some

costume or wear some badge or‘

sign; Yale with blue and white

hats and banners; Princeton in or- I

ange and black, and so on with
every delegation. They all march
into the great hall singing and
cheering, while hundreds from miles
around and who ﬁll the balcony

lookon with deep interest. Cheering

is the feature until time for the reg-

is a wonderful sight.
!“Andover,”‘shouts the master of
ceremonies. And then come men

out of the Harvard, Yale & Prince-

_ton delegations, climbing over
chairs and rushing down the aisles
to join in a cheer "with their old

goes on. John R. Mott i's'le’d oil

in the great annual celebration at

is called, there may come back a
husky chorus of allegiance, etc., fol-
lowed by hail to Pitt. Fellowsfthis
can be done with your support. May
the Y". M. C. A. not have your most
earnest support? ‘ A
