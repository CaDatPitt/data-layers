Committee
To Study  
L.A. Set-Up

By JULIA THOMAS

A seven-man committee
has been appointed to inves-
tigate charges that the Uni-
versity is facing ‘a serious
crisis of academic integrity.

The appointment was an-
nounced by the chancellor Wed-
nesday in his address to students
as an answer to allegations made
by English Professor Lawrence
Lee at a recent University Faculty
Senate meeting.

Aimed mainly at the administra-
tion, Lee’s complaints centered on
the validity of courses offered and
the reasonableness of loads on
professors. Finances and ineffic-
ient use of faculty coupled with a
hesitation by faculty members to
speak out against administrators
were. reasons for the dilemma cit-
ed by» Lee in his eight point-out-
line of University offenses.

Investigation Planned

Dr. Litchfield, who admitted
that he‘ is “frankly sensitive to
campus criticism,” stated that
every one of these charges will be-
thoroughly investigated.

Inorder to have as thorough,
objective, and impartial on inves-
tigation as possible, the com-
mittee will have a chairman
from some department outside
of the School of Liberal Arts,
Professor Lee’s home ground.
The remainder of the commitee
will consist of two administra-
tors or faculty members from
other areas of the University
plus four members from the
School of Liberal Arts. The

IF , Panhel’ To Adopt
Two Foreign Orphans

. By STAN STEIN _
Interfraternity Council, in conjunction with Panhellenic

Council, voted unanimously last Wednesday night to adopt-
two young orphan children in a foreign country under the

Foster Parents Program.

Cost of raising the two children for one year amounts
to approximately’25 centsrper fraternity man and sorority

woman.
Perpetuation of this program has
not as yet been guaranteed, but
there are planspto include the cost
of maintaining the children in
future Interfraternity Executive
Council budgets.
Investigates Two Plans
If and Panhel have been in-
vestigating two ‘plans and have
chosen one under which they
would be able to choose the sex
and nationality of the children,
but not the ages.
A freshman scholarship pro-
.gram was also approved by
members of the Council. The
program provides for a series of
meetings during the first week
of the 1962 fall trimester, and
its purpose is to introduce in-
coming freshmen to chemistry,
English, biology, math and
foreign languages. These were
found by a Council investigating

committee to be the hardest
freshman subjects.

An announcement of fall tri-
mester rush dates by Jules Zacher
precipitated a lengthy discussion
as to the feasibility of an informal
rush. C

The Council finally voted to ac-
cept September 12 through the
22nd as formal rush dates, but de-
cided to delay discussion of a
formal rush until each fraternity

Storm Trooper Fails
To Promote Rockwell’

By MATTHEVV NESVISKY I

A Storm Trooper of George Lincoln Rockwell’s American
Nazi Party visited the University campus last week in an at-
tempt to ﬁnd an outlet for his party’s propaganda and possi-
bly have Rockwell address the student body.

Clinton Ridenour, who resides at the American Nazi
headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, spoke to several mem-

bers of The Pitt News staff in the.‘

ofﬁce of the Director of Student
Publications last Thursday.

According to Irving N. Roth-;

man, director of Student Publi-
cations, Ridenour originally had
contacted him because “A Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh student had
written a leter to Rockwell ex-
pressing a desire to hear him and
learn more about the American
Nazi Policy.”
Visits Othr Organizations

After discussing the ideology of
his organization with Rothman
and the student newspaper repre-
sentatives, Ridenour then visited
the Student Union Board, the
Book Center and the University
library for the purpose of gaining
permission to distribute informa-
tion about the Nazi group.

The central piece of propa-
ganda which the Storm Troper,
a part time cement worker and
cook, attempted to have placed
on campus is a hand-bound au-
tobiography entitled “This Time
the World,” by Nazi “Com-

mander” George Lincoln Rock- ,

well. .

The 440‘ paged book, which is
dedicated to Adolph Hitler, takes
its title from a quotation from
the Fuhrer: “Today G,e1‘many, to-
morrow the world.” '

Seeks Presidency

In the autobiography, Rockwell,

proposes to “preserve America”
by legally being elected to the
Presidency by 1973. He then in-
tends to have all American Ne-
groes, returned to Africa and “deal
with the Jews in-this country,
80 per cent of whom are Com-
munists.” , C
When Ridenour offered the
autobiography for sale to Paul
R. Boltacz, General Manager of
the Book Center, he was turned
down. ~‘

Frank E. Wedekend, assistant

Group, WPDU

A program of modern dance
and a debate between. the
University’s William Pitt De-

bating Union and the Cornell"
Debate Association will be

presented by the Midday Ser-
ries on separate dates this week.
Merce Cunningham, recipient of

the Dance Magazine Award for‘

outstanding achievement in the
ﬁeld of dance, will perform with
his company Wednesday at noon
in Stephen Foster Memorial.
Resolved: That the House Com-

mittee on Un-American Activities.

subject of the debate between the

UniVeI‘Sit.Y and Cornell Friday at

noon, in the SU Ballroom.

Cornell Debates Affirmative

Presenting the affirmative ar-
gument, the Cornell team will be
represented by Nancy Rosen, a
freshman from Long Island, New
York, and Alan Berkeley, a soph-
omore from New Rochelle, New
York.

The negative side will be de-
livered by the University team
consisting of Alan Cazen, a
sophomore English major who
IS a member of the University
championship team, and Law-
"3nf3e Prﬁfant, a junior English
manor who has debated for a

‘With a company headed by

Carolyn ‘Brown, leading dancer,‘

Cunningham has toured exten-
sively in the United States and
Europe and in 1960 they were in-
vited to appear at the Interna-
tional Festival of Contemporary
Music in Venice as well as the
West Berlin Festival. V

A Ch0!‘e0gl‘aDher of, various
modes of dances from the lyric
to the comic, Cunningham
claims his dances “do not at-
tempt  tell stories or to ex-
press neurotic states of mind,
but rely on the action of the
dancing for their expression.”

One time holder of the first po-.
sition of dancer-in—residence, at
the University of Illinois, Cun-
ningham and company have been
for the last four years in residence
at the Connecticut College School

Aiding the troup will be David

complished in the use of whistles
and knockings to enhance his
score. ‘

rector for the company is John '

Ridenour had offered to sell
copies of the book to the Center

could then sell it for as much as
$25, Ridenour said, as the Ben
Franklin Book Store was doing

the volume would be turned over
to the American Nazi party.

ently met defeat again when he

“If he makes a formal application

Rockwell was invited to speak ‘

at Bucknell University in Lew-

but the administration of that
school later retracted the invi-‘
tation. The Nazi leader then
came to the town last month
and began to lecture in a public
square, but quit after ten min-
utes due to harrassment by the
audience.
According to Ridenour, the
American Nazi Party “has attract-

‘years of its existence. The mem-

bers and supporters contain Cath-

olics, l»’ro1cs-tants and even Jews.”

Linus Pauling Warns

Of Nuclear

Dangers  

By RAISHA SILBERMAN
Dr. Linus Pauling, scientist, and 1954 Nobel Prize win-
ner, says the danger of current nuclear testing and possible

attack is so extreme that total
warranted.

disarmament is immediately

War has always been immoral, but according to Paul-
ing’s Midday Series speech last Wednesday, “there is now

small immorality connected with‘?
war which did not exist before the
Atomic Age." He was referring to
the deformation and imminent
death of future generations of

children—deaths induced by fall-
out from bombs now being tested.

Pauling stated that current Ru.s-
sian nuclear tests will eventually
deform 1,750,000 children and kill
an estimated 20,000,000. “The car-
bon 14 contained in even the
‘clean’ bombs is the most import-
ant cause of human damage. It will
deform hundreds of generations to
come and if the arms race con-
tinues, it will involve destruction
and death in all parts of the
world." _

U.S. Bombs

The scientist calculated that the
U.S. now has 100,000 megatons of
atomic weapons and surmised that
Russia has about 50,000. “One
bomb weighing 20 megatons is
enough to kill ten million people -
it can destroy an entire city.

“Moreover, atomic stockpiles
have doubled each year since
1945. By 1966, there will be 500,-
000 times as many megatons as
were used in all of World War
1]. Each addition to the stock-
pile increases the ehances of ac-

cidential war.

“The only way to prevent war
is total disarmament,” Pauling de-
clared. “However, disarmament
alone is not enough for there is
no way of guaranteeing that each

Shelters Harmful
He also explained that bomb
shelters “really increase our dan-
ger because Russia; might be in-

fluenced to drop even a bigger»

bomb, thinking that shelters were
in the way.” .
Pauling scolded the U.S. for
constantly “taking the lead to-
wards greater militarization.
Even now when we are in front,
we are planning another series
of atmospheric tests.”

He proclaimed his belief that the
people of the U.S. should “engage
in civil disobedience.” He" feels
that citizens must influence the
President and protest whenever

the government tends to endanger

life and liberty.

Dr. Pauling said he would like
to see the day -when there will be
“freedom and justice under inter-
national law. Compromise and in-
itiative on behalf of the U.S. are
necessary “if we are to realize the
destruction awaiting us if we
ignore the urgency of total dis-
armament."

According to Dr. George Crouch,
chairman of the English Depart-
ment and secretary of the Univer-
sity Council, the Chancellor has-
stressed that this committee will
not be limited to Professor Lee’s
comments but will work as a fact-
finding body in all areas of the

» University.

Evaluation Sought

Dr. Litchfield compared the
expense of the Lee investigation
"to the Colodny case which in-
volved almost $100,000. In an-
swer to the Chancellor’s com-
parison; Dr. Crouch explained
although he doubtsithat this in-
vestigation would reach such

proportions, it could reach a

considerable amount due to im-
partial help from other univer-
sities.

The majority of expenses in the
Colodny investigation went to
lawyers and agents from abroad,
according to Dr. Crouch. He fore-
sees no repitition of these condi-
tions in the current issue.

Professor Lee‘s reaction to the
investigationwas, “The Chancellor
has chosen to release this informa-
tion; he knows what he is going
to do and I don’t. Any further
statements must come from him.”

By Jackie Katz

Chancellor Litchfield, in his talk
last Wednesday, promised to dis-
pel some,of the images which the
students have toward the Univer-
sity! He was referring to the many
criticisms of faculty and adminis-
ration which have been heard.

Speaking in the Student Union
Ballroom before approximately
200 members of the student body,
faculty, and administration, Dr.
Litchfield explained that in 1956
there werea lot of “third rate”
instructors in the University. Fac-
ulty committees were then ap-
pointed to rate each teacher. The
instructors were divided into three
groups; good, uncertain, and poor.

Continuing on this topic, he
stated, “I did not change one of
the judgments made.“ He explain-
ed that 75 percent of the poor
teachers are gone. “You still
have some faculty members who
aren’t very capable,” he said. “A
lot of these people are still here
because they have tenure or for
other such reasons.”

Dr. Litchfield also mentioned
that before 1956 we did not have
one faculty ,member from a
prestige institution. “Now this
has become as institution to
which people from all over the
world want to come." he said.

other topic covered in his talk. Dr.
Litchfield told the audience that
when he came to the University in
1956 most of the members of the
board were local people. “The
members now come from all over
the world," he stated. “We have
the heads of Gulf, Alcoa and other
big corporations."
Rarely Seen

Dr. Litchfield explained that
while we rarely see any members
of the Board of Trustees. they give
the "University a lot of support,
financial and otherwise.

The remainder of the speech
was concerned with the physical
plant of the University. He men-

The Board of Trustees was an-.

tioued that he resents remarks that
the University favors “bricks over
brains.” This statement was in re-
ference to remarks which have
been made stating that the Uni-
versity would rather build new
buildings than use the money for
other purposes such as scholarship
aid.

He stated that a distinction
between “bricks and brains" at
any university is artificial. As an
example he sited the proposed
ten million dollar Hillman Li-
brary. “A good library is es-
sential to a good scholar," he
said. “If you don’t know that we
need a new library, I don't know
who does."

Dr. Litchfield also explained
that not one cent which has been
spent on the building project
could be spent. on anything else.
“Not one cent of the operating
money has‘ been spent on con-
struction since I’ve been here,” he
told the audience.

Slides of the University were
then shown. He explained that the
slides were divided into three
groups; buildings obtained or com-
pleted, buildings financed or" in the
process of being completed, and
those which are not yet financed.
“I’ll get those buildings for you if
you can tolerate me another five
years," he said. '

Same lee- Way

In an informalrdiscussion before 200 students, Chancel-
lor Litchﬁeld promised to investigate thoroughly and objec-
tively what_he termed the “Lee Affair,” without any fur-
ther explanation. By so doing he publicly released what
"had-been considered an interfaculty matter on English Pro-
fessor Lawrence Lee’s now famous Senate Speech.

The downtown papers immediately seized on the im-
plication. that all was not well within faculty walls, and
‘students, too, questioned the obvious dissatisfaction within
«their professors. Yet no answers were given except a vague
charge against “academic integrity.”

Certainly the actual facts of the case are not so aston-
ishing as to remain secret, and the Chancellor’s tendency
in the past to discuss with students major University af-
fairs justiﬁes his public reference to the situation. But the
, manner and tone in which it was done seems to us a ser-
‘ ious misjudgment of students and faculty alike.

Although his speech coveredia variety of offenses, Pro-
fessor Lee stressed that one of the major purposes in pre-
senting his view was to develop an exchangeof ideas on
A the Senate ﬂoor—a place where, before the last meeting,

no reporter was permitted to enter. The need for freer and
franker discussion in the Senate was agreed upon by the
Chancellor. Yet the consequences of followingthis course
are now only too well known by Professor Lee and his
colleagues. ‘

People will always resist change and administrators
will always be aware of such dissatisfaction. No one really
-believes that progress can be achieved overnight or in ﬁve
years, nor do they expect such miracles. If problems do “ex-
ist and these problems are pointed out by someone who
honestly believes that by continuing to ignore or suppress
such conditions a serious dilemma could occur then this
. does not justify forcing him to pay the consequences if his
beliefs are false. 7 .

_ The establishment of an impartial committee and th
Chancellor’s willingness to invest $100,000 from the gen-
eral funds if needed to settle the dispute hardly stimu-
lates the type of informal and honest discussion which
usually leads to eﬁective solutions.

A If the “Lee Affair” merited student attention at all,
then the entire matter should have been freely and fully
explained. And if free and frank discussion is to come to
_ the Senate floor, then those who use this right should be
granted the conﬁdence that what is said is said honestly
and with integrity and without fear of future retribution.

Nazism, 16 years after the end of World War

II, is not dead. For proof, one had to go no

farther than the fourth ﬂoor of the Student Union
last Thursday, when Clinton Ridenour, ambassador
from George Lincoln Rockwell’s American Nazi
Party, was interviewed by members of the Pitt
News staff. '

With 9,000 members and an active life of three
years, National Socialism has enjoyed a re—birth
in a country which fought it for ﬁve years and in

V which it seemedto have the smallest chance of

survival.

What type of people does National Socialism
attract, and what are its chances for success? The
answers to these questions were suggested by the
character and personality of Ridenour and by a
reading of a} book which he hadbrought to the

l'University “ to sell through the University Book

Store and donate to the University library.

The book, “This Time the World,” is George
Lincoln Rockwell’s “Mein Kampf.”

Dedicated to Adolph Hitler, whose _ “mighty
spirit has inspired millions with the Holy Truth,”
the book was printed and bound by hand in. a
New.York City apartment, because, according to

Ridenour, “Jew-‘Communist publishers” refused to C
_ touch it. ’

Written for '|ntel|ectuo|s'
“This Time the World” is directed “more to the

I intellectual circles, presently drowning in oceans

of Marxism which have inundated all our colleges
and universities, than it is to the masses of com-
mon people, for whom the knowledge that I am an
exponent of gas—chambers for Jewish (and all
other) Communist traitors is suﬂicient understand-
ing of my philosophy.”

However, if Clint Ridenour is an example of
the intellectual toward which this book is aimed,
Rockwell has sorely missed his mark. ,

In language liberally sprinkled with the words
“nigger” and “J ew-Marxist,” Ridenour told us how
the United States was responsibleifor World War
11, how there were more men killed in the- Korean
War than in World War II, and how Negroes in the
United States outnumber the whites.

We also heard how Adolph Eichmann could not
be guilty because, there weren’t six million Jews
in Germany, Poland, and Russia to kill, and we
learned that men are judged upon war experience
and‘how good they were as soldiers (Ridenour was
a paratrooper in World War II and the Korean
War, Rockwell a Naval Commander).

Platform Parallels Hitler's _

If.one looks carefully at the platform and de-

velopment of the Nazi Party up to this .point, a

"certain distressing similarity between it and Hitler’s

rise to. power during the late
comes evident.

The American Nazis areitaking advantage of the
Southerners’ deep rooted fear that a Negro may

someday marry his daughter and have somehow .-
connected this internal problem with the so-called .
Jewish-Marxist threat to American security in.

order to further a “fear” and /“hate” policy which

Hitler used so effectively to bind .people’s minds ,

during the post-war European depression.
The only difference in the two cases being that

Rockwell is offering the American people “ethnic ‘
and political security” while Hitler offered his “eco- '

nomic security.” The scapegoat in both cases re-
mains the same —- Negroes and Jews.

Not only does Rockwell fail to prove the Com-
munist aﬂiliation of the Jewish people, but he also
offers no logical reason why all the American
Negroes should be shipped back to Africa, except
that he doesn’t want to see "our White Race de-
graded to a nation of brown mongre1s.” »
Logic Slips

His arguments are all based on mere supposi-
tion; Rockwell does mention numbers of Jews con-
victed as Communist agents, but from this point he
diverts to calling them “rotten Jew-creeps” and
accuses them of “peddling pornography, firewater,
narcotics, lies and hate.” '

This is due, probably, to two reasons —— The
ﬁrst being that the United States is not in the dire
economic status that Germany was at that time and
that the American people have seen too much of
the ravages of Nazism to ever consider it seriously
as a way of life.

If these. two reasons be not enough, consider for
a moment the increasing intelligence and aware-
ness of this country to the moral and ethical prob-
lems of the world. Would the United States ever

consider prostituting‘ its moral well‘ being to a‘

dubious and hate inspired organization?
Question of Ethics , .

The sincere Nazi never stops to take into ac-
count any ethical considerations concerning his ac-
tions. Wholesale murder was ethically and morally
wrong at the time of the Second World War no
matter how Adolph Hitler felt about it and it is
ethically and morally wrong now, no matter how
George Lincoln Rockwell feels about it. .

And any man who “stand(s) ﬁrmly for posi-
tive, ethical religions, whatever they may be, and
be1ieve(s)Vthey must be protected and given the
greatest freedom . . .” and can still be a Nazi must
be labeled an ethical and_religious hypocrite.

If Americans are willing to believe‘ in practices
of Mass human extermination and forced deporta-
tion then any meaningful ethicsymorals, or religion
must certainly be discarded along with the free-
dom that we cherish so highly.

Grad Student Criticizes

Engineers’ Theme

Editor, The Pitt. News:
It is appalling to learn that the

theme of this, year's homecom-
ing was national defense—i.e.
armaments-production. It would
seem that during the opening
week of the Seventeen Nation
Disarmament Conference (which
coincided with Engineers’ Week)
at Geneva, and at a time when
our national leaders are proclaim-

‘ing their desire for world peace,
-a display which showed our en-

gineers’ talents directed toward
raising standards of human be-
ings everywhere should be the
order of the day.

The display’s title, “National
Defense: Engineers’ Role in Deter-
ring ‘Communist Aggression,” in
addition to carrying the overtones
of a publicity release for a John
Birch Society rally, is misleading.
For more than ﬁfteen years our
defense budget has been sky-
rocketing and our military esta-
blishment mushrooming whi].e
paradoxically the Communists
have been playing an increasing

. role in the internal affairsof more
M and more nations. .

‘It would‘ appear‘ then, that
‘ to sow’

   

mg -the .

  
    

problem of “Communist Aggres-
sion” is in order. Such an ap-
proach would involve a shift in
emphasis from a massive military
program to one in which our sci-
entists and engineers would be
encouraged to use their valuable
skills to combat the real enemies
of freedom everywhere—poverty,
hunger and illiteracy.

As Tap Day speaker, Nathan
Firestone, rightly pointed out: it
is time that our “student leaders’
occasionally do some .'erious
thinking about world affairs and
initiate" proper action.”

I submit that it is also incum-
bent upon the University admini-
stration to encourage students to
think in ‘terms of bold new solu-
tions to the problems that our
generation is facing. Wouldn’t it
have been more appropriate then,
for the theme of the Engineers’

Week display to have been “Sci-

ence and Engineering in the Serv-
ice of Humanity” rather than sci-
ence in the service of militarism
and war. ‘ A

“It Goes On..."

THE GREAT RAT RACE
Farrell’s Jack Marin, the 6-5 prize package in the recent
WPIAL basketball tournament at the Field House, is either
headed -for Duke or Pitt. He is a long-time personal friend
of Brian Generalovich, and their families are extremely

 

. close.

“I am very impressed with the outstanding educational
opportunities at Pitt,” Marin said. “I want to take medicine
and I have been told by Brian that I will get every chance
to pursue that line here.”

Marin has had upwards of 50 offers. His father doesn’t
want him to go too far away from home because he wants
to see Jack play.bal1. This may nix the trip to Durham. His

"brother plays for Penn State, and Lion ofﬁcials claim that

Marin, Sr. has a verbal agreement‘ to send his son. to Uni-
versity Park since they took the older Marin to their bosom
earlier.

Marin, incidentally, is the Valedictorian of his class,
and his college board scores total around 1250.

Another outstanding product, Edgewood’s Dave Brown,
may be in Blue & Gold next year. One star whom we W111
not see, however, will be Clairton’s Stu Johnson, the 6-8
center of the Bears.

Sleeps Thru Tesfs ,

Johnson slept through the college board tests, and some
feel that he has been advised not to take the tests for fear
that the school which oﬁcers him a scholarship eventually
will be ridiculed by opponent schools with standards.

Johnson admits that some recruiters have been over-
zealous. “They have offered me extra spending money,” he
grinned.

One top-notch WPIAL player, when askedwhich
area team he prefei-s,.said, “I have nothing against Pitt,
I just want to go away to school. But there is one team
in this area which I wouldn’t want to play for because
I don’t like the way they play.” i

A neighborhood policemen told me about the gendarme
set-up for the high school games at the FH. According to
the schedule which he showed us-, one policeman from each
station is assigned to all the WPIAL games, but for the City
League championship there were two policemen from each
station, two K-95, and two matrons for the girls restrooms.

For He's A Jolly Good Fellow .

Policemen at the gate conﬁscated 22 bottles of rum, gin
and wine- (“whiskey costs too much and it doesn’t hit the
head as fast”), and the ground crew picked up about ﬁve
more empty bottle under the bleachers.

If so many ballplayers want to go_away from home

when they pick a college, why doesn’t Pitt scour the sur-
rounding territory on the State borders more than they do?

Basketball talent in New York, New England, New Jersey
and Washington, D.C. is pretty high-class.

Bob Bennett, the cock-sure center of Mt. Lebanon,
doesn’t fear the surplus of great basketball material at
Duke. They have some big centers,” Bennett said, “but
they don’t have any cornermen.

Bennett however shies away from predominant images
at Ohio State and Cincinnati. “It’s too tough to follow Jerry
Lucas and Oscar Robertson.”

One Ivy League coach was less than impressive when
talking to a prospect at the FH. He acted as if he were
inferior to the other talent scouts who were pestering the
kid.

He wanted the player to consider an Ivy League school
almost as an afterthought. A good appearance and a strong
personality are musts for a college recruiter.

If you watch recruiters in action for too long, you can
get deathly sick at your stomach.

Buckeyes Capture IM Title;
Yaccino Has 26 In 74-72 Win

Last Thursday night before an estimated .50 people, the
largest crowd of the season, the Buckeyes defeated Delta
Sigma Phi 74-72 to win the University Intramural. Basketball
Championship at the Stadium Gym.-

Not morethan ten points ever separated the teams.
The score was 36-36 at the half, Delta Sig, and 56-56 at the

end of three quarters. In the last?
canto, the Buckeyes kept the lead
between two and six points.

With two seconds left in the
game and the Buckeyes leading
74-72, a player ran onto the court.
Delta Sig protested that they
should be awarded a foul shot
and then take the ball out of
bounds. The referees, however,
claimed that they did not see the
incident and the game ended with
an argument on the subject.

Toughest Game

Thiswas the toughest game the
Buckeyes had all season as they
rolled over their opposition in
winning the Independent League.
It was a little tougher in the play-
offs but “the iron five” prevailed.
The five were boys who saw ser-
vice with the football team last
fall.

Thursday night they were led
in scoring by John Yaccino who
tossed in 26 points to lead all
scorers. Yaccino was the most
valuable player in- the game, be-
ing the top playmaker as well
as scorer.

Jim Traficant, the Buckeyes’
leading scorer all year, poured in
21 markers. He was followed by
Al Grigaliunas with 13, Paul
Cercel with ten and Lou Slaby
with four.

The Delta Sigs, who won the
class A Fraternity League, defeat-
ed the class B champ, and rolled
through the playoffs, had their.
leading scorer John Jenkins, and
John Pignetti splitting forty
points. Leroy Henry followed with
12.

The hoop action beat ‘a fast
tempo in the finale of the intra-
mural basketball championship
game in the Stadium Gym last
week.

Coaches Seek Replacements or
Departing Seniors At Three Posts

65 Candidates To
Report March 20

By BOB SMIZIK
Approximately 65 candi-
dates will be on hand to open
‘spring. drills for the Panther
football team~ on March 20.

if ‘past forms hold true Coach

John Michelosen. will
not get his charges

probably
cracking

1 ' shoulders until early in April, due.

to the weather.

~.Thirteen lettermen are
from last year's team which fin-
ished with. a dismal 3-7 record.
However, Michelosen has 26 let-
termen with which to build this
year’s team around.

The biggest voids are at end and
center. The only returning mono-
gram winners at the terminal pos-
ition are,Bob Long and A1 Grigalo
iunas. Steve Jastrzembski, John
Kuprok and Woody Haser have
their playing days behind them
and the coaching staff will be
looking for replacements.

Top Prospects

Certain to get a good look over
by End ‘Coach Ernie Hefferle are
sophomores to-be Bill Howley of
Munhall and Ron Robson of New
Kensington.

Missing from the center of the
line will be the dependable
Andy:Kuzneski who. held down
that‘ position for two years. His
spot will be taken over by
Chuck Ahlborn, who was Kuz-
neski’s reserve last season and
John Holzbach who lettered in
1960 but failed to do the same
last year.

Positions where there will be
little ‘opportunity for newcomers
to break in at are guard, quarter-
back and ’ fullback. Four letter
winning guards, Ralph. Conrad,
Tom Brown,‘ Ray Popp and John
Draksler should be more than ade-
quate next to the center.

Quarterbacks Jim Traficant,
Glenn Lehner, Paul Martha, Den-
ny Chillinsky and Sam Colella
supply more than enough talent

fforrthe signal calling chores.
Nor will there be any lack of

ability at fullback will Rick Lee-
son, John Chisdak, Lou Slaby and
John Telesky hold forth.

If Michelosen can fill the gaps
end and center it
could be a good year for the grid-
ders.

-LeVine Twins Lead Swimmers

To RecordiBreaking Campaign

Schenley , High
Grads Versatile

By LEN BERENFIELD
Panther swimming coach
Ben Grady -is one man Who
doesn’t have to be convinced
that good things come in
The veteran mentor

has been acutely aware of
this fact since a couple of ‘look-
alikes, Robert and Ronald Levine,
entered the University.

Based on their past perform-
ances, Coach Grady expected a
great deal from these much-
sought after swimmers. In their
ﬁrst season of intercollegiate com-
petition, the lightning-like twins
did not disappoint him.

The Levines Wasted no time in
pleasing their coach this year.
Swimming in their ﬁrst college
meet against West Virginia, both
‘Rob and Ron broke Pitt records.

/«.Rob set a new record in the 200

yard back stroke while brother

Ron cracked the old mark in the

200 individual- medley. '
Preview Early

The West Virginia encounter
was merely a preview of the
twins’ later performances. Their
record breaking efforts repeatedly
caused double trouble for oppo-
nents and led the Cat swimmers
to_a fine 8-3 season log.

"Unlike most team members,
Rob and Ron are self-taught
swimmers. When they were
eleven years old they frequent-
ed the YMHA pool, splashing,
around in th e water until
unco-ordinated efforts ﬁnally
became recognizable as those of
a: swimmer.

Since those early days of their
careers, the story of Rob and
Ron Levine has been one broken
record after another. While per-
forming for the YMHA, they cap-
tured several AAU—AMA records.
Rob owns AMA—AAU marks in
the 100 and 200 meters and 100
and 200 yards back stroke. Ron
holds the mark for the 220 yard
butterfly. At Pittsburgh's Schen-

“Ron. and Rob are really great

his fabulous sophomore stars. The
amazing thing about them is that
they can swim any stroke well. I
would probably have to rate them
as the best a1l—around swimmers
I have coached in my years at
the University. Right now they
are very good and with a little
more experience could possibly
attain national recognition.”

. They may get their chance at
the NCAA championships later
this month.

Spring Is Here

Golf, Tennis Call Players

Pretty soon the Field House will
be an emptylrshell as most of its
winertime inhabitants desert it for
the refreshing outdoors. The
squashplayers can exchange their
racquets for ‘larger versions, and
golfers can quit using their bed-
room carpets for putting greens.

Coach George Underwood ‘has
extended an invitation to students
wishing to become candidates for
the Panther golf team. Candidates
are requested’ to report to the FH
conference room at 4:00 p.m.,
March 21, at which time Coach
Underwood will be available to
meet all prospects.

The duﬁers will play a ten
match schedule, traveling to Ohio
State, Navy, Kent State, West

Virginia_ and St. Vincent. They
will play matches in this area
with Ohio University, Duquesne,
Georgetown, Georgia Tech and
Penn State. All home engage-
ments will be played at the Wild-

‘wood’ Country Club.

All tennis candidates are like-
wise asked to get in contact with
Coach.Bi1l Summers this week at
the FH. Summers is conducting a
series of tests to determine the
basic talents of prospects.

Candidates will be tested to see
how many times they can play
the ball oif the wall of the hand-
ball court in a speciﬁc time period.
Some, of the veteran members
richochet the balls off the wall

like bullets, but there is room

for newcomers.

Gets Underway

_The newly. initiated intramural
rifle. league has begun sectional

competition. The sharpshooters of ‘

Dithridge have taken thesection
1 lead over Schenley 5A, Holland
10B, Salk—Schenley Dithridge, and
Holland 8 and 10C.

In section 2, Schenley 5B re-
mains on top of Holland 8, H01-
land 6, Holland 10A, and Schen-
ley 7 and 9. This league is open
to all University dorms. Partici-

tensive and a rule change has al-
ready been introduced.

Instead of scoring the matches
on the ﬁve best scores of a team,
the judging will now be based
upon the top three scores. A team
may still have more than three

members, but scores below the top
three will be disregarded.
