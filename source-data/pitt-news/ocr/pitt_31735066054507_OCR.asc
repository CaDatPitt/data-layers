Alumni support falls, and no

 #9 5 '<'

   

The number of Pitt’s alumni donating
to the school has plummeted, and experts
say the amount the University receives
should be at least twice its current level. ,

A research team led by James L. Fisher
in August, 1995, showed that Pitt’s alumni
fundraising success is very disappointing
for such a large institution. The Fisher
report stated that Pitt’s alumni donations
should be double what they are now.

“We have experienced some donor
erosion,” said Leland Patouillet, assistant

‘ vice chancellor and executive director of

the Pitt Alumni Association, “but we are
working hard to combat that erosion and
are making progress.”

But the question remains: why do so
many alumni refuse to donate money to
their old school? ,

I No one can say for sure, but many sus-
pect this is the result of dissatisﬁed gradu-
ates who treat going to the ‘school like a
business transaction: they paid their money
and got their diploma. _

Many feel they didn’t receive any sup-
port from Pitt, financially, or socially, so
they don’t give anything back after they
graduate. A

institutional advancement.

State, and she said she noticed a lot more

school ‘spirit there than at Pitt.

On Monday, Pitt Police Chief Rick
Boyd announced plans for the use of a

as early as this spring. ‘

Boyd said he’s posted a notice for all
current ofﬁcers who are interested to apply
to become a motorcycle patrol officer.

erate in allowing Pitt’s new cyclists to be
trained alongside their own oﬁicers.

“The advantage to being one of the last

that we can ask the other departments what’s

Pitt Gommcrge protest

Moll Smith

   
 

The acquittal of Brentwood police offi-
cer John Vojtas in the death of Jonny
Gamrnage last week sparked heated
protests throughout Pittsburgh. But Pitt stu-
dents showed little interest in a march
denouncing the verdict this Saturday. ’

A campus rally to protest police brutal-
ity and the Gammage verdict was orga-
nized by the Black Action Society’s
Political Action Committee. It was attended
by approximately 35 representatives ﬁom
six Pitt campus organizations: the BAS,
International Socialist Organization, Asian
Students Association, Campus Coalition
for Peace &Justice, Campus Women’s
Organization, and Free Mumia Abu Jamal.

The enthusiasm of those present was
high —— the turnout was not

Discussing other protests in the area,
Pitt alumnus Darryl Wiley said, “It’s a trav-
esty to know that high school students
attracted close to 1,000 people for a march,
and a college campus like Pitt couldn’t
attract 50 people.”

‘Despite the low turnout, organizers
began a procession down Forbes Avenue at
1:45 p.m., boldly chanting “No justice, No
peace.” Some students canied their chil-
dren in the march, while others held signs
reading, “Black and white — Unite to
ﬁght.” W

Reactions to the parade of protestors
was mixed as they made their way down
the street. Some groups of people were
inspired bythe marchers, stopping to watch
them pass, and breaking into discussions

about the case. Other individuals sneered
and muttered as the group went by.
Oronde Sharif, a graduate student in
the school of , social work, spoke to the
crowd when they returned to the Union.

"Ihepcarnpus community needs to get » ‘

on the same wavelength. It’s a shame that
more students aren’t out,” he said. “It seems
that most are disassociated from important

issues and what happens in the city of 

Pittsburgh.”
Tina Gross of the International

‘Socialist Organization said student apathy

isn’t what kept people from turning out.
She said the low turnout was due to stu-
dents’ disillusionment with the, current
political system. .

Aishia Anderson, chair of the BAS

Political Action Committee, said she was i

disappointed and expected a much larger
turnout. _

“People need to realize that the
Gammage incident could happen to any-
one,” she said. “It is not an isolated incident,
it’s happening everywhere. This is not a
black issue, it’s a people issue.”

Those present engaged in a group dis-
cussion, in hopes of generating new ideas to
ﬁght police brutality across the nation.

Organizers scheduled a meeting
Thursday, Dec. 5, at 6 p.m. in the William
Pitt Union to discuss their plans further and
decide on the best way to put them into
action.

The meeting will precede a beneﬁt
concertfor the Gammage Family and the
Campus Coalition for Peace and Justice at
the Bloomﬁeld Bridge Tavern at 8:30 p.m.
that night.

THE PITT NEWS

 

heaped words of praise on Majors.

Nordenberg said, “John Majors is one
of the ‘people who made Pittsburgh the
‘City of Champions.’ However, Mr.
Majors’ coaching legacy cannot be mea-
sured only in terms of games and champi-
onships won. On and off the ﬁeld, he
always has represented both Pitt and the
Pittsburgh region with character and
class.”

Pederson says he’ll look forward to
continue a working relationship with
Majors, whose 184 wins rank ﬁfth among
active coaches. Pederson worked as
recruiting coordinator for Majors at
Tennessee. I

“I could not be more pleased, as I take
over as athletic director, to have the talents
of John Majors available to our depart-
ment,” Pederson said. “I am anxious to
work with him again, this time in a new
role, to enhance the future success of Pitt
athletics.” _ ‘

The future of Pitt athletics obviously
needs a new football coach. With several
schools like Illinois, Purdue, and
Minnesota also looking for coaches,
Pederson will be hard—pressed to ﬁnd a
competent replacement quickly. He said
the search will begin immediately.

_ Although Majors will have some say
in future University athletic decisions, he
will have no say whether his coaching
staff stays or who the new head coach will
be. '

Majors’ prepared media statement
read as follows: .

‘The final whistle at the Rutgers game
Saturday will be the ﬁnal whistle for me as
Head Football Coach at the University of
Pittsburgh. I am resigning my position as
the head football coach immediately fol.-
lowing the game to assume new duties at
the University. I
“This decision is a result of ongoing

discussions I initiated with Chancellor

[Mark] Nordenberg starting in mid-sea-
son. When the game ends on Saturday, it
will mark theend of 52 years of continu-
ous football service by the Majors family
— playing and coaching. And I would. like
to acknowledge the tremendous support
I’Ve had always from my family.”

‘ “If you’ll indulge me for a moment or
two, I would like to tell you what this
game has meant to me. I can’t remember a
time when I didn’t love football, except

maybe at the ﬁnal whistle of a losing
game. Football gave my father, who
coached for 40 years, a wonderful way of
life, and that is likewise for me. My father
was a great teacher, and he taught me to
love the game as passionately as he did.
“Football also provided my four
brothers and myself a chance to obtain a
college education and it has given my fam-
ily more thrills and rewards than you could
expect in two or three lifetimes. Both my
mother and my dad were intensely com-
petitive people, and they instilled in me a
great desire to win. Also they expected,
without exception, that ,we win with class
and lose with dignity. Through 48 years as

a player and coach I have also adhered to»

what they have taught me.

connect alumni to Pitt, in the hopes that the
graduates will remember their old alrna
mater with a donation. .

“We have 175,000 addressable alum-
ni, and we try to concentrate on the four I’s
— Identify, Inform, Involve, and Invest —
when dealing with them,” said Patouillet,
“but we have not historically done well in
identifying and informing alumni.”

But they also want to use alumni as
positive examples of what Pitt produces.

“A lot of times people correlate alum-
ni support of Pitt with just ﬁnancial sup-
port,” said Patouillet. “We break it down

into nine areas of support.”

The alumni encourage enrollment at
Pitt , by generating scholarship aid for
undergraduate and graduate students, a
program which has grown in the last four
years to increase the
number of awarded
scholarships from four
to 45.

The Alumni
erated sources of
income (through dues,
etc.) have increased
from $35,000 in 1992
to $600,000 in 1995,
according to the Fisher
study.

Yet, in spite of this
growth, its budget is
less than the American
Association of
Universities average. As of 1994, Pitt
ranked last in alumni support and alumni
participation when compared with six
other AAU institutions of higher educa-
tion. 6

Pitt tried to change this deﬁcit in a
number of ways. It hasincreased the num-
ber of constituent groups that comprise the
Alumni Association from 45 to 76 in the
last four years, created a toll-free. alumni
number, and formed one of the top alumni
association web sites in the nation.

All this has been done in order to
keep in contact with Pitt alumni who live
in 119 foreign countries’ and all 50 states.

“Because people are increasingly
busy, we are attempting to ﬁnd new and
creative ways to involve them in the life of
the University,” said Patouillet. “We try to

FROM PAGE 1

take the University to them.”

Apparently, it’s starting to work.

Just talk to Dale Mertz, a 1970 gradu-
ate of Pitt. “I think the Alumni Association
in recent years has informed me of upcom-
ing events more than in the past,” he said.

Even Chris Chaney, evening supervi-
sor of Pitt telemarketing, has seen a visible
increase in the last two years of alumni
monetary giving.

“We are right on track to meet the
monetary goals we have set for this year,”
said Chaney. “Last year alumni giving
experienced a 5 percent increase, and this
year we are well ahead of that pace. This is
a dramatic improvement from a few years
ago, and we still haven’t even spoken with
those people who have a long history of
giving.” P .

Albert Melfo,
Director of
Telemarketing, also has
noticed a degree of
improvement.

“Over 50 per-
cent of people who give
in the past will give
 again, and 12 percent of
 alumni who have never
given are supporting
us,” said Melfo. “This
is . four percentage
points above the mark
that is traditionally
viewed as a good turn
 around rate. People
don’t realize what a strong statistic this is.”

According to Duronio, out of the
175 ,000 addressable alumni there» were
26,000 alumni donors in 1996, 15 percent
of total alumni gave. This was up by one
percentage point from the 14 percent aver-
age over the last 10 years.

Pitt telemarketers’ experiences and
statistics have shown that recent graduates
of Pitt are becoming more responsiveand
are currently one of the most supportive of
all the University’s alumni groups.

“I think r11 deﬁnitely give afterl grad-

uate,” said Tom Strickler, a Pitt senior. “I
had a good experience here, and I’m a
merit scholar. The scholarship I received
was made possible through alumni dona-
tions, and I would like to help those stu-

— dents who come after me.”

Boyd said Pitt Police Captain Tim

cles on campus.

Delaney had to present his case to the
state legislature in requesting the money as
well as the University Board of Trustees in
receiving their approval, succeeding in both

collaborating on making the motorcycle
police a reality. »

_“Don’t give all the credit to me,”
Delaney said. “[Boyd’s] the one responsible,
so give him the credit. I might come in here
and ask for two helicopters, one blue and
one gold, to match Pitt’s colors, but if he
says no, it means no. We’re lucky to have the
progressive leadership that he gives us.
\V1thout progressive leadership, none of this
would be possible.”

State-‘sponsored funding will grant
$50,000 to the Pitt Police Department in
January. The money will cover the new
Harley-Davidson cycles along with helmets,
boots, and clothing for the officers.

The new motorcycle uniforms, made of
Gore—Tex‘ with Kevlar shoulder and elbow
pads, will provide the oﬂicer with maxi-

Gore.-Tex body suits are being utilized more
and more on the east after becoming very
popular among police officers on the west
coast. g

Majors resignation will help
Pitt athletic programs

It is the end of an era. Johnny Majors has left Pitt for the
second and ﬁnal time.

Well, sort of. He will still be around as a “special assis-
tant to the chancellor and athletic director.” What this means
is still unclear, but one thing is for sure: he won’t be coordi-
nating the offensive or defensive lines at Pitt games any
more. A

Pitt brought Majors back in 1992 to revitalize the "foot-
ball program. It turned out to be a dream that didn’t come
true. This resignation comes at an opportune time and may
have even been a bit overdue.

First, the win-loss record since Majors returned has not
shown any dramatic changes. While Majors did make the
effort, the context of Pitt football has changed since his ﬁrst
stint at Pitt. Facilities have aged, other schools have devel-
oped stronger programs, and Pitt’s own ﬁnancial resources
have declined.

   

Second, the change-over in the staff comes at a time-

when there is real potential for changeat the University. We
have a new chancellor, a new athletic director, and now we
can work on’ building a successful football program to carry
Pitt into the future.

Some tout a successful football program as a way to cure .

student apathy and alurrmi ennui with Pitt. While this may
not be the panacea that Pitt needs, a football program’ that
makes money rather than suffering from a debt may help the
University deal with some of the ﬁnancial strains that it will
undoubtedly feel in the coming years.

Pitt has managed to be savvy in keeping Johnny Majors
around to help the new Athletic Director, Steve Pederson,
understand the situation he is facing. The trick will be to use
that input to learn from the mistakes of the past and not repeat
them through old modes of thinking. 0

Pitt finally has the chance “to transform the present and
discover the future” instead of perpetuating the past and dis-
ﬁguring the present. ~

Tips for procr

.

There are a million things to do
and a million things to think about.
I’d like to take this opportunity to
share some of my more interesting
experiences and things I learned
about dealing with the last few
insane weeks of the semester follow-
ing fall break.

Put simply, the ﬁrst and fore-
most thing I learned is that these are
the “Buckle Down” days of winter
here in Pittsburgh. They are the days
to become a hermit for two weeks
and do all the work we’ve been

_ neglecting for the past three-and-a-

half months, or three-and-a-half
years, depending on how long
you’ve been here. Much to my
regret, around this time every semes-
ter, I end up with hundreds of pages
to read, massive papers due, and to
top it off, ﬁnals looming in the dis-
tance. I
Freshman year, I did something

of course, being the procrastinator
that I am, I didn’t do it — ever.
Instead, I spent two caffeinated days
straight studying for my tests. This,
in itself, could not possibly be
healthy. The rnidterrns went fairly
well. The ﬁnal, however, was a dif-
ferent story. Ihad other ﬁnals to cram
for (surprise, surprise), so I didn’t
start studying for my exam until the
night before. Nothing unusual here,
yet. I then consumed massive (and I
do mean massive) quantities of
Mountain Dew. Through the caf-
feine tremors and hyperactivity, I
blazed through chapters at lightning
speed. After a while, around 6:30
am, the caffeine began to wear off.

ostinotors from the master

\V1th glazed over, bloodshot eyes
and signiﬁcantly disjointed thought
processes, I decided, in my inﬁnite
wisdom, to try to get one hour of
sleep before the 8 am. physics
exam.

Needless to say, despite a blar-
ing alann, I slept a little late. A friend
called me on the phone during the
middle of the exam to ask where the
heck I was. I raced out the door half-
dressed with a pencil in my hand rar-
ing to go. From then on it is all a blur.
People tell me I came in the room
with my long hair sticking straight
up with sleep wrinkles still on my
face. Doc Stewart was a life saver.
He told me to calm down, and he let
me take the test. I think I went into

auto-pilot mode. To this day, Doc,

still tells this story to his freshman
class as an example of what not to
do. I learned a few things from this.
First, I realized that at some point I
should stop procrastinating and
study a little more ahead of time.

Easier said than done. However, if

you should get caught in an all-
nighter, NEVER, EVER go to sleep.
After an almost all-nighter, there are
no such things as cat-naps — they
are more like comas. Nothing short
of the entire Pitt band playing direct-
ly into your inner ear will wake you.

Sophomore year, I pulled a sim-
ilar stunt. This time it was not entire-
ly my fault. I stayed up until three,
when I decided my brain was full
and I was going to bed. I set my
alarm and went to sleep. I woke up at
11 the next moming to the sight of
the infamous blinking 12:00, having
missed two midterms. The moral of
the story getan alarm clock with a

- battery back up. The power in South

Oakland is about as reliable as a

three-dollar bill.

Cramming is a bad thing. Ifpos-
sible, I think we all should learn to be
a little more conscientious. In actual-

“ ity though, there will always be one

class that is so abhorrently difficult
or so boring that I have been paying
less attention than I should have
(understatement of the year).
Crarnming is then necessary.
Unfortunate, but necessary. Caffeine
helps, but it can’t perform miracles.
The main thing to remember is to
study as close as possible to the other
side of the universe with respect to a
bed (or anything resembling a com-
fortable place to sleep). '

As I sit in the wee hours of the
morning poring over my book and
sleepiness oornes over me, I ﬁnd‘ it
surprisingly easy to convince myself
that I’ve studied enough and I should
get some sleep. Lately, I like to get at
least six hours of sleep before an

exam. I ﬁnd myselfto be much more .

coherent when I take the exam. It’s
kind of nice to take an exam when
I’m not on the edge of madness from
lack of sleep. I highly recommend
trying it. However, if you haven’t

“done anything all semester, cram-

ming may be the only way to survive
the exam.

In retrospect, I know I should
have been a little more thoughtful
(OK, much more thoughtful). .I’m
still a tenibleprocrastinator. Ihaven’t
missed an exam since, but my study-
ing habits haven’t changed a great
deal. I think it might be a genetic
defect. I’m kidding, but if you are
like me,IhopeIhave providedafew
useful pointers and ifnot, at least a
good laugh at my misfortune.

Jay DeMam'n0 has been known to I

go months without sleep.

Turkey Bowl

Many people have already packed their
bags and hit the road for home, so for those
of you who have stuck it out ‘til today and
have even scrounged up enough interest to
pick up The Pitt News , thanks.

Thanksgiving is by far the best holiday
of them all. Think about it —— it is basically
the only American holiday, with the excep-
tion of Arbor Day, that is universal.
Everyone can celebrate Thanksgiving, no’
questions asked. No religious qualms either.

This Thursday to end all Thursdays
requires absolutely no gifts, no handing out

. of candy, no lighting of candles, no ﬁre-

§ works, no paying. homage to those who
I fought for our country. There aren’t even

oﬂicial decorations for Thanksgiving. If you

think about it, we are getting together to cel- ,

. ebrate ancestors many times removed sirn-
ply getting together and partying.
V All we did to the holiday was add foot-
ball. As we all know, football goes great with
anything: '

For John Majors, it is
his last game as Pitt’s head
coach and probably, his last
game coaching. In his 29
years of head coaching,
Majors won a national
championship with Pitt in
1976, coach of the year in
1973 and 1976, and com-
piled a 184—l37—l0 record,
22nd all-time on the
NCAA’s coaching victories
list.

L Longevity‘ in college
coaching is rare, and Majors
is currently fifth among
active coaches for games

coached with 331. He was

head coach at Iowa State
(1968-72), Tennessee
(1977-92), and Pitt (1973-
76, 93-96). Sixteen of his 29
teams have made bowl
appearances. He’s won nine
of them.

Despite struggling the
last four years at Pitt,
Majors can finish his career
at Pitt with a 45 -45-1 record
with a win on Saturday
against Rutgers. Remember,

by a dismal record.

gram. Majors gave» Pitt a
future because of an
unequaled work ethic and
football smarts. After his

first stint as Pitt’s head

coach, Pitt went 50-9-1 in

“Two qualities of Coach

Majors will not be
remembered for his unsuc-
cessful comeback attempt,
but for how he transformed

} Pitt football from obscurity

to the mecca of college foot-
ball in the late ‘70s and
early ‘80s.

He inherited a program
in shambles. Pitt was the
joke of its opponents and
fans. Four years after
Majors arrived in Oakland,
Pitt was national champ. He

Hockey's heroic comeback against CMU

 
 

rm. ‘ 

This past Saturday, South Side’s
Neville Ice Rink welcomed one of its

biggest and loudest crowds for the Pitt- ,

Carnegie Mellon hockey game.

Unfortunately, it was mostly ClVlU .

fans who filled the bleachers. They were
accompanied by their 10-member pep
band.

By the , end, of the second period,

CMU had a 3-0 lead to cheer about.

, However, in the beginning of the third
period, the CMU band hit afew sour notes
as they watched their hockey team blow a
three—goal lead. 7 -’

After only two minutes of play in the
third, Pitt scored three quick goals to tie
the game. The scene was reminiscent of
last year’s 3-3 tie. I g

This year, Pitt was making history, not
repeating it. 3

VV1th 1:31 left in regulation, Pitt’s
Travis Wrﬂs scored the garne-winning
goal as Pitt defeated Carnegie Mellon 4-3'.
Will’s game—winner was his second goal
of the contest.

Contributing to Pitt’s come-from-

behind victory were Bill Elliott and Chris’

Bickell with three points each, Shawn
Goldstein with two points,.and goaltender
Patrick Kenny. The win improves Pitt’s

record to 5-1-1 and boosts its division
record to 3-0-1. A —
“It was one of the best games I’ve

ever seen,” Pitt’s student’ coach Pete‘.

Reitrneyer said. “The team was ﬁred up.
They came together. They played like a
team and acted like a team.” /

Early into the second, CMU scored
on a power play, taking a 2-0 lead. CMU
took advantage of their two-goal lead and
kept up its offensive attack. ' a

After another Pitt penalty, CMU
scored its second power-play goal and
third goal of the contest with 4:56 left in
the second period, taking a 3-0 lead.

“We can’t be taking dumb retaliation
penalties,” Pitt’s Bob Hoehn said. “It was
a really physical game. Take the hits if you
have to to make the plays. If we take stu-
pid penalties, they can kill us.”

Pitt headed for the locker room down
by three goals with only one period left to
make a move.

The locker room- speech by Pitt’s
Assistant Coach Rick Neet, must have
been all the inspiration the Panthers need-
ed. .

“Rick gave a good speech in the lock-
er room. He said there was no reason we
should be down 3-0,” Reitmeyer said.
“We were playing better hockey than 1
them.” ‘

Pitt proved they were playing better

hockeyas they exploded in the beginning
of the third.

Fifty seconds into the third period,
Elliott scored, assisted by Bickell, putting
Pitt on the scoreboard and into the game.

“The ﬁrst goal raised the team
morale,” Hoehn said. “You could tell
something was completely different. We
all came together as a team and really
wanted to win this game.”

Less than a minute later, Elliott scored 9

again, beating the CMU goalie to the
upper left comer of the net, assisted by
Bickell and Goldstein.

Eleven seconds later, Pitt’s Wills
scored the tying goal assisted by Elliott
making it a 3-3 hockey game. A rattled
Carnegie Mellon team watched an appar-
ent victory slipped through their ﬁngertips.

“I -don’t think they expected us to
come back,” White said. “We caught them
in a weak moment, sitting back.” _

Carnegie Mellon wasn’t ready to lose
the game. They conducted an offensive
attack midway through the third period
that was arrested by some impressive
saves from Kenny. .

After Wills’ goal put Pitt ahead,
Carnegie Mellon pulled its goaltender
with a minute left in regulation. However,
the only result of the CMU man advantage
was a near empty-net goal by Pitt’s
Goldstein.

More coaches get the axe In

Swimminggcmd diving
please coaches at Indiana

__l?gtrick Robertson

   

Pitt’s men’s and women’s swimming
and diving teams headed off to the
University of Indiana on Thursday with
high hopes. They knew they would face
some stiff competition, but expected to do
well.

Those expectations turned into realities
as both the men and the women claimed
second place at last weekend’s Indiana
Invitational. ‘ I

_ ‘ The men fared especially well. They
lost to the host Indiana by only 41.5 points.

The Hoosiers ﬁnished with 1163.5 points,’

while Pitt tallied 1122.‘ The other competi-
tors -—- Iowa, Cincinnati, Michigan State,

1 and Kentucky ——- ﬁnished with 667.5, 398,

261, and 96 points respectively.

The Panthers won 10 events in the
three-day invitational. Pitt claimed ﬁrst
place in two relay swims and eight individ-
ual races. s

Pitt also ﬁnished second in three diving
events. All of these second place ﬁnishes
were turned in by Pitt’s resident diving
expert John Soulakis. ‘

Men’s Head Coach Chuck «Knoles
said, “We had some excellent swims on the
team this weekend. Gosh! We  so many

g good scores.” ‘

Pardon this expression, but Knoles
sounded like a kid in a candy store.

A three-day invitational was a new
experience for his very young team. He
spoke of his team’s frustration of waiting in
lines to swim.

He called the results of the meet
“excellent.” Knoles was also pleased to see
his team put in such a stellar performance
this early in the season. He thinks that this
will help prepare them for the Big East
Tournament in'F.ebruary.

The women fared just as well in a
meet, although the Iowa Lady Hawkeyes
didn’t participate.

Pitt’s Coach Marian Cassidy said, “I 11

am very pleased for this time of the sea-
son.” ,

She was pleased because almost
everyone beat their best times of the young
season and some even broke their personal

records. She says the conference is “hard to

call” but believes Vrllanova, Notre Dame,
and Miami are strong. She also mentioned
that Pitt, West Virginia, and Syracuse aren’t
too far behind the top squads.

Last year, the Lady Panthers ﬁnished
sixth in the 13—team conference and hope to

improve on that mark this year. Cassidy
- sees a wide-open conference race this sea-

son.
Both teams have a lot of home meets

left at Trees Hall before they ‘make their

push for the Big East Tournament. The next
meet is Dec. 13-15 for the women, which is
their Christmas meet.

There's still some good games, and Vince gots winners

 

Correct me if I’m wrong, but
did Lou Holtz actually say that he’s

stepping down at Notre Dame as a.

happy man because he can look up

at God knowing that he left the pro-

gram clean?

Give me a break. I’m sure that
God is in fact a football fan, but I
doubt that he roots for the Irish. In
fact, I think He pulls for
Washington State, but that’s another
story. Whether the Notre Dame pro-
gram is actually clean is also debat-
able.

And what’s this garbage from
the national media about the unpar-

alleled tradition and pressure to win’

at Notre Dame? Sure, there’s great
history at Notre Dame, but no more
so than at Ohio State, Alabama,
Texas — or Pitt, for that matter.

I think Coach Majors did a great
job of putting Notre Dame into per-
spective on his weekly talk show
prior to the Pitt-Notre Dame game.
Asked by Bill Hillgrove how the
Panthers would deal with the Notre
Dame “mystique,” Coach replied
that there is no mystique —_ they

just happen to get better players at
Notre Dame. Coach is right. I’ve
seen five games at Notre Dame in
my life and, while the atmosphere is
pretty good, there is no “mystique.”
In fact, at times it feels more like a
three-ring circus or a freak show
than a football game.

On to the picks.

Mississippi State (4-6) at
MiSSiSSippi.(5-5) — One thing I’ve
never been able to figure out is how
a black player is ever convinced to
attend Ole Miss, where the fans
wave confederate flags at. home
games. I know that Ole Miss calls
themselves the Rebels, but isn’t it a
slap in the face to the black players
to wave confederate flags?
Bulldogs Coach Jackie Sherrill uses
the confederate flag issue in recruit-
ing battles with Ole Miss.
Mississippi State 27, Ole Miss 21.

Notre Dame (8-2) at USC (5-6)
— The only greater. scam than the
Notre Dame “mystique” is the
Notre Dame-USC “rivalry.” USC
certainly doesn’t have any trouble
recruiting great talent, so I suppose
some day this game will live up to
the hype. Notre Dame 38, USC 14.

Rutgers (2-8) at Pitt (3-7) — If
Rutgers could convince a small
fraction of the great New Jersey
high school talent to stay home,

Pitt grapplers set to tangle
with Bloomsburg tonight

Brian Knavish

 

The 17th—ranked Panther wrestling
team will take to mat to open their season
against un—ranked Bloomsburg tonight at
7:30 in Fitzgerald Field House.

“We’re definitely ready,” junior
Larry Sprecher said. “We trained all off-
season and have been practicing hard
since we started in the beginning of
October. I’m not guaranteeing anything,
but if everyone wrestles up to their abili-
ty, we should win this match.”

Tonight also marks the first step in
the Panthers’ quest for an Eastern
Wrestling League championship,
because Bloomsburg is a conference
rival.

“You have to take it one match at a
time,” Head Coach Rande Stottlemyer
said. “If you start looking past teams or if
you take anyone for granted, you‘ll end
up in trouble.”

Eliminations were held last week to

determine the starting lineup for tonight’s
season opening match.

Chris Stevens will start at the 118-
pound weight class, Rob Loper at 126,
Chad Jesko at 134, Mike Dixon at 142,
Sprecher at 150, Jacob Schaus at 158, co—
captain John Withrow at 167, fellow co—
captain Bryan Matusic at 177, Mark
Bodo at 190, and Rick Vettorel will start
at heavyweight. A

“I think we match up well against
them [Bloomsburg],” J esko said. -“I think
we’ve got a real strong team this year.”

True freshman Rob Loper will make
his first start as a Panther grappler
tonight.

“I’m a little nervous, but really I’m
more excited than anything,” he said.
“We’ve been practicing forever. It’s
ﬁnally time to get the season going.”

Pitt looks to make a serious run at the
EWL title this year, and there are several
All-American candidates. on the team. In
order to get that extra push, the Panthers
need strong fan support.

Larry Sprecher has stepped up his performance. He is now the full-time starter
at the 152-pound weight class. Tonight Pitt wrestles at the Field House.

“Coaching football is a demanding
occupation. You’re under public scrutiny
Saturday after Saturday, but the highs far
outweigh the lows. There is nothing to
compare with the feeling of electricity with
a Saturday afternoon. That’s why I never
considered coaching a job. It’s been a labor
of love. I was asked this question about a
week ago: ‘John, would you do it again?’
Absolutely. V

“Throughout my coaching career, I
have been privileged to be associated with
several outstanding institutions, none of
which holds a ﬁner place in my heart than
the University of Pittsburgh. I also have a
deep appreciation and love for the city of
Pittsburgh and its many wonderful people,
who have twice opened up their arms to
embrace me.

“This is a special part of the world and
country — Pittsburgh, Pa. Through coach-
ing, I’ve been fortunate to live in some spe-
cial communities and made wonderful
friendships in the places we’ve been. And
we cherish the friendships we’ve made in
Pittsburgh. We . greatly appreciate the
warmth which the people of this area have
always shown us.”

“Throughout the years, with only a few
exceptions, the media has treated me fairly.
Many have become genuine friends. I’ve
also had the asset of working with some
great head coaches and some truly out-
standing assistant coaches. I shall always
be thankful for their efforts and loyalty.

“I certainly owe debts of gratitude to
the institutions who gave me the opportuni-
ty to do this thing that I love so much.

 

Especially, this institution which has done
that twice. I also appreciate the great fan
support we’ve had through the years. But
the ultimate reward of coaching has been

I’ve had the pleasure of
coaching. A

have won champi-

ply all our young men with proper values
and success in football that will also equip
them for success in life. It has been a privi-

once again serve as

“I am pleased
with some of the things

The facilities have
begun to be improved, and a recruiting net~
work has been established, and there are
promising young players that are in our
program that, I believe, have bright football
futures ahead of them. I’ ve been pleased

with the hard work, enthusiasm, and dedi- W

cation that the players in this program have
displayed. I would like to thank each and
every one of them for their continued posi-
tive attitude to Pitt football under circum-
stances that have often been trying. Though
sometimes severely out-manned, our play--
ers tried their hardest to represent the

University and, most of all, themselves to ,

the best of their ability. They will deserve
every success that comes their way next

talk about the game 1 until the next
Thanksgiving comes around.

For me, this game ﬁrst became a sta-
ple of turkey day at the tender age of eight.
I remember the ﬁrst game well. The ﬂur-
ries whipped around my neighbors yard,
which was our makeshift stadium and the
wind whistled like a drunk frat guy on
Liberty Avenue with a roll of quarters and
a gleam in his eye.

I never became a factor that day, as I
basically got beat up on play after play. My
face was rubbed in the mud and I got hung
out to dry a few times. I was determined to
come back with a vengeance the next year.

Didn’t happen the next year, or even
the next.

By the time I was 11, I ﬁgured out
what the problem was. I was playing with
the wrong crowd. For a reason that I can’t
explain, I always found a way into the
vagrant game in my ‘hood.

The 17-year-old vo—techer who took
smoke breaks after every touchdown. The
guy who wore the really tight Wrangler
jeans with the tongues of his hi-top sneak-
ers sticking out. He would wear the old, tat-
tered junior—high jersey when we weren’t
even in junior high yet. That should have
been a sign, but I was young and naive. I
just didn’t know any better. I didn’t think
anything when he would drive to the ﬁeld.
Every neighborhood had one of these
guys, don’t try to deny it.

And for those of you who were that
guy, I hate you, you chi1dhood—scam'ng

(Please excuse me for the tangent.
There are many deep scars that come to
mind when I think about football growing
up, and this seems to be the best medium to
vent them. Heck, it doesn’t cost me $100
an hour and I don’t have to lie on a couch.)

Anyway, I am looking forward to this
year’s game. For many of us, it will be the
last time we come home from college for
Thanksgiving and get together to play with
the guys.

Pretty soon, we will start hearing the
excuses from the guys for not being able to
play. People won’t be able to make it back
home as easily as before and the game will
dwindle. That’s why I urge all of you to
take full advantage of this God—given right.
Before you know it, backs will be sore and
knees will be weak and the game will be
forever lost. What was once a muddy,
bloody release of enormous levels of
testosterone will become a group of tired,
turkey—ﬁlled, beer mongers unhappy with
their lives and arguing about which Steeler
ﬁght songis the best.

I wish all of you a safe and happy
Thanksgiving break and encourage every-
one to get out and make his Turkey Bowl
the best it can be.

the football greatness of its past.

“John Majors is one of the people
who made Pittsburgh the ‘City of
Champions,”’ said Chancellor Mark A.
Nordenberg. “The national champi-
onship he won with his 1976
University of Pittsburgh football team
always will be one of the most memo-
rable achievements in this region’s rich
sports history.”

With his career victories alone,
Majors will go down as a coaching leg-
end. It is also his knack for turning
football programs around that will
ensure him a place in college football
history.

Besides that magic wand he waved
at Pitt, he also catapulted his alma
mater, Tennessee, into national promi-
nence. They became a contender within
a couple of years of his arrival and won
the SEC championship in 1985,1989
and 1990. It was the first time the Vols
had won back—to-back SEC champi-
onships since 1940.

Brothers Bill and Bobby were stars at

John was the star of the family. In
1956, the scat—back led the Vols to a 10-

Kevin Lilley

 

Curtis Anderson has been a
letter-winner at wideout for the
Pitt Panthers since 1993. His

playing time increased every

season, making him a more valu-

able offensive team member as

he moved into his senior year.

Then, a few injuries to
defensive backs and a coaches
meeting later, Curtis Anderson
the wideout disappeared shortly
after the team took a beating at
Ohio State. ,

Later in the week, Curtis
Anderson resurfaced.lAt comer-
back. '

Anderson remembers it this
way: “Coach [Gary] Nord, the
week of the Miami game, said,
‘How do you feel about playing
defense?’”

I “I said, ‘Anything I can do to
help the team.’”

Others were considered, but
according to the coaching staff,
Anderson was the only one with
the right attitude — the receiver
willing to disrupt his receiving
career for the good of the team.
The senior admits to some early
concern, but has adjusted to his
new position and has quickly
become a vocal leader of the

' Panther defense.

Just last summer, Anderson
gave up a season of track and
field to focus on his pass—catch—
ing. Not a small commitment —
Anderson won the pentathlon at
the 1995 Big East Indoor
Championships —— it was only a

signal for. further sacriﬁces to

come.
“‘I always wanted to play
receiver, basically,” said
Anderson, who was recruited as
a wideoutbut worked at corner
brieﬂy as a freshman.
“[Cornerback] wasn’t something
I wanted to do back then. I was-

’jn’t really big enough. Not that

I’m that big now, or anything.”
Size or no, Anderson’s time

came at the Orange Bowl this

year, where he started his first

"game in a defensive secondary

since his years at E.C. Glass
High. ‘
While the decision to shift
Anderson was a staff-wide con-
sensus, it was viewed quite dif-
ferently by those who agreed on
it.'Receivers Coach Nord, in his

'l'|'IE PITT NEWS

Curtis Anderson took one for the team — moving. from wide receiver to cornerback.

first year at Pitt, saw the reason-
ing behind the decision that
would rob him of his most expe-
rienced player.

“In the circumstances  I
feltit was the best thing for the
football team,” said Nord. “We
were desperately needing some
help on the defensive side of the
ball.”

Nord had his reservations,

saying he wasn’t “completely
sold on moving [a] starter in the
middle of the season, especially
from offense to defense.”

It didn’t help that
Anderson’s backup, Jake
Hoffart, was new tothe system.

On the other side of the ball,
Defensive Backs Coach Tony
Pierce had a slightly different
outlook.

“My role [in the decision]
was pretty much saying, ‘I need
him’ ,” said Pierce. ‘‘I was excited
to see that he was ready to go.”

Ready or not, Anderson’

went. His only safety ‘net in the
Miami game came from Pierce’s
defensive alignment, which put
him on the Panther sideline
regardless of the Hurricane
offensive setup. Pierce could

 

shout in directions, and
Anderson could concentrate on
Miami’s receiving corps. His
inexperience showed versus
Hurricane speedster Tony Gaiter,
but afterwards, Anderson quick-
ly dismissed it.

“I wasn’t impressed,” he
said.

Gaiter didn’t impress
Anderson, but Anderson
impressed the coaching ‘staff.
After Rashaad Whitmill’s injury
in the Miami game, Anderson

’ retired his white number 23 prac-

tice jersey permanently — no
more offense.

“We originally planned for
him to play both ways,” said
Nord, who suddenly lost his
wideout for all but a few special
offensive situations. “At Miami,
Whitmill went down, and he was

. tied up at corner full—time. After

that, we felt that it would proba-
bly be too much.”

By the next week and for the
rest of the season, Anderson
would be completely immersed
in the Panther defensive scheme.
Special alignments and forrna—
tions went out the window -— the
three—year receiver had to adapt
in a hurry. Pierce still drilled him
in practice, but game day help,
according to Anderson, came
mostly from his teammates.

“A lot of help came from
Chuck Brown,” said Anderson.
“I’d come off the field, and I’d be
able to ask him things. John
Jenkins will give me some calls
when I’m not sure of the play or
what’s going on. He helps me a
lot.” '

He may rely on‘ redshirt
sophomore Brown for pointers,
but Anderson still considers him-
self a leader among his defensive
teammates. He and Jenkins are
the most vocal at practice, cheer-
ing the secondary from the side-
line and trash—talking receivers
during coverage drills. It’s all
part of the presence that
Anderson brings to the new posi-
tion.

“The other players saw that
he was not coming over to joke
around,” said Pierce. “He has a
purpose-”

Anderson agrees: “Just
because I’ma senior, I take on a
leadership role. They put me in a
starting position — I can’t sit on
the back burner.” ,
