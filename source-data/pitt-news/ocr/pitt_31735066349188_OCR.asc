 ‘Blacks Paid a Price '—- Baldwin

..
', .5

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

No people in the world have had
such a curious history or have paid
a higher price than American
blacks, author James Baldwin told
a crowd in the Student Union
ballroom yesterday. '

Speaking as part of the Sixth.
Annual Black Week, Baldwin s/aid
blacks are not the only people in
theworld that came to America
without wanting to. “We did not
"sit somewhere and dream the
American dream,’.’ he said. '

Everybody who came to America
—-Italians, Poles and others-—had
to pay his ticket, according to
Baldwin. “These people had ‘to
give up their ancestry and be
white,” he said. “This divorce,
blasphemy, has produced mindless

. people.”

Baldwin viewed the world as
ruled by white people. “My mind

_was ruled by white people,” he

said.

Black people were brought to .

America to be slaves and .make
money for. others, Baldwin said.
“Every black man comes from that
moment when the ﬁrst chained
black man got off the boat,” he
emphasized.

Baldwin noted the troubles for
the black man today. “We are not
the only oppressed in the world,”
he said. “The world is not white.”

“There’s no corner of the globe
where‘ we are not heard, and

said. “In fact, we are the only

SCAR Granted Partial
Recognition from SGB

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The Pitt chapter of the National
.Student Coalition Against Racism
(SCAR) was given partial recogni-
tion as, a student organization in
Student Government Board (SGB)
action Wednesday night.

As a student ‘organization with
partial recognition, . SCAR is
entitled to request only up to $100
in funds from Student Government.‘
As a student organization, the
group is entitled to request
supplies and space in the Student
‘Union. -

The SGB rejected a Committee
on Student Organization (CSO)
recommendation to deny the
original SCAR request for full
recognition. .

CSO representative Bruce Keel-.

er explained that the thrust of
SCAR was not chieﬂy directed
toward the Pitt community, and its
function and goals overlapped with
those of other existing organiza-
tions.

“SCAR does involve students in
the University and we are active
with issues in Pittsburgh that
involve Pitt students,” SGB and
SCAR member Mark Satinoff said.
“We do not duplicate the efforts of
organizations like the College
Young Democrats or the College
Young Republicans.”

Keeler said SCAR could not

receive full recognition as origin-

ally requested, according to CSO
bylaws. “The period of partial

recognition acts. as a probationary

period and gives the SGB the
chance to see how active the group
can be.” , ’

Kissinger says

BY BILL MOORE

Secretary of State Henry Kissin-
ger said the United Nations was no
longer the best hope for world
peace and again condemned the
U.N. resolution equating Zionism
with racism, during a press
conference in Pittsburgh Wednes-
day.

“The decision of the Adminis-..

He added, however, the United

Placement Fees Needed,

School of Ed Maintains    

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

School of Education placement
are necessary to
compensate for increased operation
costs, according to the director of
Educational Placement Services,
Richard V. Allshouse.

Undergraduates are charged $10
for ﬁve dossiers, School of
Education graduates pay $25 and
Each
additional ﬁle is $2.

“Our mailing costs are. up $5,000
from last year, and our microﬁlm-
ing costs are up $6,000,” Allshouse
said. “We only had two options,
personnel cuts or student fees.

“There are only six people
working here now, and if any were
cut, we couldn’t handle the work.-
We don’t get any budget alloca-

tions since the educational place— ‘

ment service isn’t' considered a
mandated organization,” Alls-
house added.

The number of people using the
educational placement service has
doubled since 1970- More than a
thousand sets of ﬁles were sent out
last year, according to Allshouse.

“We could have done away with
some of our services, but I don’t
think that’s» the answer. For

‘instance, we keep all ﬁles for three

years and then convert them to
microﬁlm. '

“Some universities -just throw
them away. We can help graduates
who already have a job ﬁnd a better
one.”

The question of educational
placement service fees was raised
at Monday’s Senate Council
meeting by English professor
Richard Tobias. The council
decided, it was not a faculty issue
but a student concern. _ V

“I think it is a faculty concern.

We’re talking about budget alloca-

tions. But the Council recom-
mended the students deal with the
issues,” Tobias said.

The University placement ser-
vice is free, but it does not ﬁnd
teaching situations, according to
Placement Director Raymond G.
Oyler." _

“We only deal with corporate,
government and social agency jobs.
The educational placement service
handles teaching positions,” Oyler
said. '

“We only send out one- or
two-page resumes. The education-
al placement service has to send
out stacks of credentials. Public
schools require all ‘sorts of
information and recommendations.
We couldn't handle that here,”
added Oyler. »

“I have always been against ‘fees
of any kind. I did away with the
graduation fee, the change of grade
fee and others. But there was just

no way around- this one,’-’~A1ls~g

house said. _
“And with the matriculation
fees, activities fees and everything

else a student pays now, I really"

don’t- think our fee is that
deal. After all, we’re providing’
better service now than we everdid
before,” he concluded. ‘

Nations action will add to the
tension in the Middle East.

Asked to comment on Donald,

Rumsfeld, the man ,President
Gerald Ford named to replace
recently ousted Defense Secretary
James Schlesinger, Kissinger
termed him “highly intelligent.”

“He knows the political process
extremely well,” he said.

“It is our obligation as secretar-
ies of State and Defense to conduct
the nation’s business and not to
carry out feuds, and I have every
intention, and I'm positive he has
every intention, to work closely
together.”

“We have very important
national decisions before us and
they cannot be constantly evalua-
ted in terms of personalities,"
Kissinger continued. “The victor-
ies we celebrate should not be

personal victories. but victories of

national purpose. "

“Some people still think it’s more
important to be white than alive.”

The hunger in the world is a

After the SGB vote, President
Larry Platt said, “This means
SCAR has partial recognition until
April, 1976. Outside the auspices

of Student Government, the activi- -

ties of SCAR could be different-.”

SCAR currently is using space in
the SGB office.

In other action‘, SGB voted to

- approve the Allocations Committee
recommendation to deny the
Amateur Radio Association's
(ARA) budget modification of $600
to book the ﬁlm Deep Throat.

The Allocations Committee rec-
ommended denial of funding for
the ﬁlm because movies are shown
regularly on campus during the
week, and free ﬁlms are shown
through special departments in the
University.

Allocations questioned the need
for further programming in this
area. The Allocations rationale
also argued that the ARA request
did not fall into any of the existing
categories of ﬁlms funded by SGB.

According to _the Allocations
rationale, the purpose of showing

“The revenue collected would
not be used to ﬁnance further

the operational basis of what may
be a small special-interest group.”

ARA President Sanford Silver-
berg accepted the SGB denial of
funding. '

“The ARA has been approached
by an undergraduate (student)
willing to back us on Deep Throat,”
Silverberg said. “We still plan to
book the ﬁlm.”

At Silverberg’s request, the SGBf.\r

passed a resolution supporting the
ARA in their efforts to show Deep
Throat at Pitt.

“The SGB ~believes...the ﬁnal
judgment in viewing any material
that might be deemed controversial

administration of the University of

Pittsburgh,” the resolution said. , .

Satinoff informed the SGB of a

‘Civil Rights Movement

«‘~»Not Advancing'—— Rowan

%

BY TOMMIE NELL TAYLOR

“All is not well in the civil rights
movement,” nationally syndicated
columnist Carl Rowan said Wed-

nesday night at the 57th Bi-annual '

Urban League Anniversary Dinner
in the Duquesne Student Union.

Rowan explained that the civil
rights movement has experienced
protracted hostility from the White
House. He said too many blacks
iltought the “battle was over” in
1964, when the first major civil
rights act was passed.

“There is no clear set of goals

projected by the black commun-
ity,” Rowan said, explaining why
few advancements in civil rights
have been made recently.

According to Rowan, in_1961 a
black family had only $54 to spend
for every $100 per white family. In
the Kennedy and Johnson admin-
istration, black families’ incomes
increased to $64 for every $100
spent by white families.

“In the Nixon and Ford regimes,
the U.S. Labor department report-

 the black family has $58 to
‘ spend,” Rowan said. “The Urban

("N

League reports black families
receive only $56 in this same ratio.
Either ﬁgure indicates a marked
drop in black family incomes.

given to a maintenance rather than
demolition approach in ' public
housing,” he said. “The cost of
maintenance is one-fifth the cost of
demolition in the long run.”

Too many blacks suffer from
what Rowan calls the “Horatio
Alger Syndrome.”

“Many blacks are ﬂattered by
those who would single them out as
special,” Rowan said. “People tell
the ‘successful black’ that he has

pulled himself up by his boot’

straps.

PATT PROZZI, Financial Manager

The argument of Vice Chancellor of Business and Finance Joseph
Dutton that granting the Student Govemmen.t.Board (SGB) control
over the interest accrued by the student activities fee would prompt

[other groups to demand the interest from the. money g3PPI‘0P1'i3t€d to
" them is a weak one.

. f The student activities fee differs front the great body of university

.. "revenue in its purpose and management. , .
  5 7From the veryroutset, it is earmarked for students use only. It
 appears as an itemized expenditure on the student invoice each term —
. ~and goes ‘under the direct control and management of student
..  ~  allocators. -I -

There’s no doubting Dutton’s claim that the interest on University

7  1‘ ‘ revenue provides-for a ﬁnancial ﬂexibility that otherwise would not be

there. It’s foolish, however, for the University to argue for the
ﬂexibility that $5,000 will bring when this year's overall budget is
$145.7 million.

Refusal by the administration to allow the SGB control of ’ the

if ‘ , activities fee interest increases the prospects for a hike in the fee. With

the buying power of the fee rapidly dwindling, the SGB may have no
jother alternative than to increase it. .

Such little regard by the administration for student ﬁnances will
become evident then. It’s one thing to increase tuition by 14% when it

is unavoidable, and hope the students will go along with it, but it’s'

something else to hang on to a mere $5,000 when the release of it
would help avert a hike in the student activities fee.

   Questions on Quinlan I
0  ./The “Quinlan controversy” and the ensuing decision by Judge
 Robert Muir Jr. to refuse authorization toturning off her respirator

 have ‘done little to answer some of the questions posed by the advance
 of science. ‘ '

Who has the right to determine the fate of the patient when he is
 unable to determine it for himself? Can the next of kin choose to ignore
 advice, or can doctors override the wishes of the patient’s

Must the courts step in every time there is dissention?

How" are we to regard that broad middle ground between “absolute
‘ life’ ” -I and “absolute death?”

 _ And if and when answers to these dilemmas can be found, do we

‘i socially adopt them as laws, or do we leave their enactment to personal
morality? I L

J The easiest question to answer, though by no means the least
signiﬁcant, is the last one.

Since there presently are no institutions that can inﬂuence social

morality the way the Roman Catholic‘ Church did in medieval Europe

4 and since it would be undesirable to leave social behavior entirely up to
 :the individual, the citizens of western democracies have come to rely
 on their »— governments to legally codify the solutions to ethical
 problems. A L

A recent example was the furor over abortion. One side argued that

~ " the government was “legislating morality.” Though the words were
3 manipulated to give the impression that the courts were telling people
 how to live, the fact remains in the abortion ruling that choice was left
Etc the individual.

_ A more precise term than “legislating morality” would be
fj“legislating choice.”
1 In the Quinlan case, the judge was asked to rule on who has the ﬁnal
: say in removing life supports from a person who no longer can decide
for himself. . 4
,_ Muir said, “There is a duty to continue the life-assisting apparatus
if, within the treating physician's opinion, it should be done.” Leaving
the decision up to medical science, the judge refused to give Quiiilan’s
fgparents the sanction of the court to turn off their daughter’s respirator.
_ In effect, Muir was saying that physicians have the ultimate say in
'”medical problems, just as we would expect lawyers to be best-equipped

ltbrmally, the problems over removing life-sustaining "devices are
settled by the family and its doctor. But in bringing this case to the
courts, the Quinlans were asking the judge to ignore the laws
regarding the deﬁnition of death which has been upheld by the
§Supreme Court. This is the “Harvard brain-death criterion,” which
deﬁnes death as the state existing when no electrical impulsesfrom the
brain can be detected by an electroencephalograph. I “ 7 j
 Medically and legally, -Karen-Quinlan is alive. Those who disagree

As for Muir, he ruled merely on the case before him. Though he did '

little to alleviate the perplexity of the remaining questions, it was
neither-his duty nor our right to expect these answers in one decision
by-one judge. _

_ The issue at hand should not, indeed must not‘, be solved so hastily.
The open acceptance of contraceptives and the legalization of abortion
are good examples of how social opinion evolves.‘

_In due time, society will come to terms with the ‘question of the
life-death threshold. Ultimately, it will be deﬁned and codiﬁed into
law. As it stands today, we can be only ironically thankful we've been
provoked into thinking about it. ’

End to unemployment

    Shackles on a Comeback

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY .

Slavery, the oft-cursed offshoot
of colonialism; is worth a second
look these days, with the welfare
rolls getting longer and longer and
many of us wondering just what
we’re going to do when we
graduate. \

Naturally with our present-day
obsession with the intent and

meaning of words, we would not’

want to revive “slavery” per se,
but under another term, such as
“federal work-enforc_ement” ' or
“mandatory vocation-contract-
ing,” it would be more readily
accepted.

What are the great arguments
against slavery? -It demeans "the
individual? It allows one human to
take advantage of another? It lacks.
recognition of the rights of the
individual? ‘

There is nothing here we cannot
witness in our own cities three or
four times an hour. '

Certainly then, mandatory voca-
tion-contracting is about as hu-

Pinball Issue:
Understanding It

I am writing to commend both
the Pitt News and Robert Longwell
for raising the point about the lack
of student consultation on impor-

- tant dorm issues". However, there

are a few vital points that must be
out for students to
understand why the pinball nia-
chine issue is so important.

First. when the machines were in
the main Towers lobby.U _they
brought in $10,000 a year. which is
used in maintenance iirthc Towers.
With the machines in the individual
Towers and most of them broken.
most of this revenue is lost. Since
the dorms must be self-sufficient.
this will force Housing to raise
student charges. With costs prob-
ably going uptdue to the building of
the Quad fire bridges and
increased power costs. it is
ridiculous for student rates to go
even higher because the pinball
machines were moved and ended

up vandalized. This accounts for -

the Resident Student Associaion's
concern about the location of the
machines. There's more than just
the machines themselves riding on
this issue.

Second. it's important to. point
out that. while the Office of
Residence Life made the decision
to more the machines. the Housing
Office had to take the
essence. the director of Residence
Life could order the machines

_ _ moved without worrying about burly

loss. In .

mane as welfare systems, or great
federal programs for managing the
growing populations of the unem-
ployed. '

A mandatory vocation-contract-
ing system would work like this:

‘banks all over the United States,

using time-sharing computers al-
ready in use, would relay the
number and location of individuals
qualifying for the federal program.

As with the draft, a set number
would be culled from this pool of
qualifying persons, and," upon
notification, would be sent to local
army bases for a set "period.

From the relocation centers,

individuals could be sent out to all -

parts of the country to complete
work on federal highways, bridges,
supersonic bombers and other
important matters.

As a result, welfare rolls would

‘take a sharp drop and the added

man and woman power would help
considerably in completing the

major projects of this nation: more

and better roads, improved drain-
age and trafﬁc ﬂow, and a lead ‘in
the East-West Asphalt Race.

effects on his office. In any
management setting where the
director can make a decision
without having to suffer the
consequences. the chances of bad
decisions being made goes up
greatly. Perhaps the Board of
Trustees. the chancellor. Student
Government and RSA should
consider whether it is really
necessary to maintain two offices in
two separate departments having
jurisdiction over the same area. -

Why Do Police  
Q Ignore Scalpers?

With Saturday's Notre Dame
game upcoming. I feel that it is
importantto ask why the Pitts-
burgh Police Department and ‘the
Pitt _Campus Police permit "the
flagrant scalping of tickets by
organized teams before the games.

When members of the College
Young Democrates leaflcted the
homecoming game. I couldn't help
but notice that while the police
were giving football prograin

potential troublemaker.

Naturallythe fringes of Ameri-
can political feeling will rise to
protest mandatory vocation-con-
tracting. The Left will feel it is too
harsh and the Right will feel it ,is
not harsh enough.

This, of course, will be a barrier
to acceptance of the program, but
conscientious legislators will be
able to guide uslthrough the rough
with a stern but paternal grip on
the issue.

We should not let these strident
voices of extremism pull us from
the path of the middle of the road,
and certainly any good citizen who

.doesn’t want to ﬁnd himself on the

mandatory vocation-contracting list
will stand up and support this idea.

In retrospect, the old system of

“slavery” was inefficient, as is the 

present of unemployment manage-
ment. However, by a simple but
effective combination of feudal law
and present-day technology, we
couldcancel out the problems for
the consumer and insure a stronger
nation.

Stereo Police

Death by Decibels

BY BILL PIAZZA

Roger. in the room next door.
threatened to call the Stereo Police
unless I turned the volume on my
radio down. “Surely he jests." I
thought to myself. “No one would
call the Stereo Police to report a
tiny clock radio."

I was totally surprised when my
door was broken down a few
moments later and three men
wearing the blue and gray uniform
of Sound Patrolmen marched in.

' One of them seized my radio and

threw it into a shopping bag.
“Evidence!" he said triumphantly.
The other two wasted no time

ihandcuffing my arms behind my

back and explaining my rights.
“You have the right to become

silent. If you give up that right, any

sound you utter will be used

against you in a court of law. You.

have the right to have a mute.
present. If you so desire and cannot
afford it, one will be appointed to
you by the courts. Do you
understand these rights as I have
read them?”
I nodded my head.

GOPYCAT

 

a

They led me off to their patrol car
amid the silent jeers of a hundred
cautious onlookers. I thought about
how humiliating this situation was
and wondered if I should call the

. Legal Awareness Committee. I sat

in the back seat lost in my
thoughts. interrupted only by the
occasional crackle of the police
radio reporting some minor dis-
turbance.

“One-Adam Four. Shout-out at
Ninth and Liberty. Suspects armed

-with 12-transistor portable. Pro-

ceed with caution . ""

‘There was a reply and I could"

picture a police car somewhere in
Pittsburgh racing towards the
intersection. its red lights glaring
and its siren totally silenced. (After
all. loud noises are illegal. even for
police.) '

At the station. I was thrown in a
dark. musty cell already occupied
by some old tramp. He gazed
intently at me for a few minutes
and produced a bottle from the
folds of his coat.

“Want a swig?"

“No. thanks."

“Watcha in for?”

"A clock radio."

"Oh. I took the ear plugs out of
the statues in front of Carnegie
Museum."

With that. he entered his battle.

I can't say how. glad I was to

‘leave the cell. A single guard came
to take me to the magistrate's
office. and'as he led me down the
hall, we passed a woman ﬁghting
desperately to hang onto some
stereo LPs that two other guards
were trying to take from her.
“They caught her selling albums

in public." my guard, told me.
"She’ll probably get a life
sentence." I

The magistrate was a timely old
geezer with a treble-clef tie clip and
half-note cuff links. I could not but
help notice his resemblance to
Wolfgang Mozart. He looked at my
papers and then at me.

“Let's see. a three-band. digital
clock radio at 82 decibels. You're a
very lucky young man. Anything
under 90 decibels is ‘considered a
misdemeanor in this state. Since

    Friday. November 14, 1_97s—THEP1i1TNEWs.-Page 5 

this is a ﬁrst offense, I'll put you on.

30 days probation and let'it go at

.that. But the next time, you'll ' _
spend a few nights in a nice quiet "

library." A

I thanked him (I don't know what '

for) and inquired whether I would
be able to take my radio with me.

He eyed me suspiciously until I 
explained I would need it to wake '

me the next morning. I got it back
and left.

Roger was sitting in his room, Z

studying. when ‘I returned.

“Roger,” Iasked, “how loud is a 
stick of dynamite when it ex-—

plodes?” P
“Around 140_decibels. Why?"

“I think I’m about to commit a 

felony." V t
I smiled as Roger's reply was lost
in the sound of the explosion._ ‘

mood-creater.

To get a reading. you must buy a
sandwich or a meal, so I headed for
a table against the wall. The 12
signs of the Zodiac hung there,
done in lively colors and mounted
on wooden plaques. -

In the center of one wall hung a
metallic, smiling sun, with the
astrological characters attached at
the end of each protruding ray.
Green window blinds and faded
white curtains blocked the outside
light, causing the pink walls to
shine dully under the yellow-cased
ﬂuorescent light. An aura of
mystery ﬁlled the room.

A sign on my table said
Najie—.the name of an old,
wise—looking lady whom I had
selected to read my fate in the
cards. She had short, curly hair
and wore an ankle-length dress.
Those dark-colored, opaque stock-

ings, popular with grandmothers,’

covered the small bit of her ankle
exposed between dress and shoe.
The manager, Miss ‘ Mosebach,
informed me that Najie gets so
intensely involved she often goes
into “trances.” At such times, her
words stream out, but afterwards

she often ‘cannot remember what
she said. .
While waiting, I noticed that

listening intently to the person in
front of them who dealt and

rearranged the cards. Clusters of-

two or four customers sat around
one ‘‘reader,’’' although several
were sitting alone.

Undercover eyes constantly
searching, I discovered the unoc-
cupied readers retired to a corner
by a white hanging drape (behind
which, strangely enough, was only
a wall—or was it an illusion?). I
stole over to the corner and began
talking to them.

The two women there, Alice and
Rita, were friendly and willing to
talk. Both had been readers for 30
years.

“I sort of inherited the tradi-
tion,” Rita said. _“My parents used
to do it over in Europe. At first, I
did it for fun, but then, after a
while you become more sophisti-
cated and serious about it. Let me
see your left hand,” she suddenly
demanded.

Putting her glasses on, she
grabbed my hand and examined

the palm closely.

“Look here, Alice,” she exclaim-
ed, “he has the ‘Star of David.’ ”
“What’s that mean?” I asked.

“You have the potential to be a
reader if you develop it.”

The ladies claimed to have
varying degrees of extrasensory
perception. ESP, they said, is a
God-given ability just like any
ability, only they weren’t sure
whether it was a blessing or a
curse. ‘

“-God-given ability” reminded
me of a philosophical argument
against the existence of God‘, and
Alice piped up, without my saying
a word, that she couldn’t under-
stand how anyone could not believe
in God: I wondered whether she
had just demonstrated her power.

Alice stared at me with minute
black rims and tiny irises. I
couldn’t stop staring into her eyes.
It was as if she was hypnotizing me
or drawing something out of me
through my own eyes. Not withdut
some effort, I looked awav_

You may have noticed I have
been calling these people “read-
ers," as opposed to fortune-tellers.

“I’m no gypsy," Rita said. “I

“That’s right,” Alice added.
“We take what’s inside a person at
the time, his cosmic vibrations, and
tell him what’s going on inside, and
what might be likely to occur as a
result of it. The point is to make
people feel good, and to gently
warn them about any problems
they have or might have soon.”

Alice told me that to feel the
cosmic power in the universe you
must stand up straight with feet
apart, arms out at an angle to your
body, and breathe in’deeply three
times. '

New Coffeehouse to

Serve Divoreees

BY MAGGEE MCKAY

Something must be done to
alleviate the isolation of divorcees

in todays couple-oriented society. -

according to ‘Sharyn Harvey. a
secretary in Pitt's Registrar's
office.

Her solution is a monthly
coffeehouse for the divorced that
will open tonight at the Lutheran
University Center. across from the
Scaife Gallery.

An alternative to the singles bar. .

“Genesis II" will offer companion-
ship and the chance to get
acquainted with others who under-
stand to the trauma of sepxsation
and divorce.

“I'm divorced. and I know that
for some people divorce is a period
of mourning,” Harvey said. “lt’s
the death of a relationship.

“Approximately 44% of society
is now divorced. 'What happens to
these people? I hope that the
coffeehouse can start some kind of
recognition of divorced people and

’ their problems," she said.

Harvey's first step in organizing
the coffeehouse was to contact the

pastor for Pitt and CaI‘negie—Me‘llon
University, who donated the
Center's facilities. Then, approxi-
mately 15 people willing to work
with the divorced called Harvey
and volunteered their services.
There are two professionals
working with the coffeehouse. The
Rev. Mr. Hora counsels those
wrestling with religious problems.
“A lot of guilt is caused from the
church view of divorce,"
stated. “Many churches _do not
accept the divorced. Also, the
ministry is schooled in marriage
counseling, but not in divorce
counseling. The chu_rch has failed
divorced people. We hope churches
will soon begin to recognize the
needs of divorced people." '

Dr. Richard Yckoff. a psycholo-A

gist and Pitt graduate, acts as a
consultant, taking clients referred
by the coffeehouse. "But we're not
in competition with anyone in
therapeutic work. The coffeehouse
stresses, fun, growth and devel-
opment." .

virtually nonexistent. Everything,
from the facilities and food to the
Friday night entertainment is

ment comes from those affiliated
with Pitt. On December 5, for
example, Pitt campus policeman

“Everybody’s just been coming
to me. There seems to be such a
great need," Harvey said. “Off-
shoot groups seem to be coming.
On Friday night. we're going to
pass out cards asking what people
would like to learn (macrame etc.)
and what things they’d like to
teach. If we get enough people for
different classes, we'll use the
Luthcra_n Center's facilities.”

Wearing a burgundy sportscoat
and a shirt open at the neck instead
of a swamiioutﬁt, he loooked just
like anyone else. He informed me
he needed not to look at cards or to
touch palms, but simply to look at
and hear a person (the other
women admitted this also). Serena

He proceeded correctly to tell me
my major, the color of my car and
that I would be at school for three
years after I graduated. (Law

Placing a hand on my left side,
he asked me if I had had trouble
with it. Itold him I hadn’t, and he
warned me to be careful about it.‘
He whimsically added that the
vibrations he was getting from my
side could mean a friend or relative
might be operated on there in the
near future. “Remember when it
happens that I told you it would,”
he warned. ‘

BY ‘MATTHEW KENNEDY

If you’ve ever read a comic book,

,.watched a sci-fi movie or heard

about the new trend in “popular

E-culture,” make an effort to view
.the comic collection now on display
in the special collections room at

Hillman Library.
"Sponsored by the Pittsburgh
Comic Club, the display covers the

‘entire history of comic art, from Tip
I Top Weekly [An Ideal Publication

for the American Youth] to a paper
the exploits of a

ella.

The ‘scope of the exhibition
ranges from the early 1900s to the
present and offers comic fans a

., ‘good taste of the history and
4 development of the art.

According to Pittsburgh Comic

' Club President Ben Pondexter, the
I 7‘ display is the first step in building a

permanent collection of comic
books for research purposes.
“We're interested in establish-
ing a comic book collection in the
city," he said, “and this display is
a way of measuring people’s
interest. .
“The collection on display isn’t
really worth that much in dollars
and cents because we were
informed there would be no

, «insurance. There isn’t anything on

display that’s worth really big
money.”

Comic books as a medium still
live under a lingering cloud of
public disapproval, even with the
advent of “hip" slupermen and
green monsters engaging in philo-
sophical soul-searching.

But comic books, like television
and movies, are simple reflections
of the state of culture, tagging
along almost revolution-by-revolu-
tion‘ with changes in American

 . thought.

I ‘‘In the 505, there was a witch
hunt on,” Pondexter said, “es~
pecially against EC Comics, which,

dealt with horror and suspense. It

was thought then that comic books
caused juvenile delinquency.

‘‘In some ways the heat’s off.
Television has taken over the
whipping post.”

Among the comic books on
display are a variety of “pulps,”
the adventure magazines, westerns
and sci-fi thrillers.

The covers, often featuring
suggestive women with improbable
breasts, are the first experimenta-
tion with the comic art form, and
the heroes, “The Spider," “The
Shadow,” “Doc Savage,” are still
with us. '

For instance, Doc Savage, the

golden superman of science and

American capitalism, can be found
in current reprints, with The
Shadow still laughing mysteriously
in a brand new DC ‘Co-mics series.

Undoubtedly this exhibition, like
many throughout the country, is an
important step in assessing what
“art" consists of in terms of
culture.

Music Strike Ended,

New Contract Signed

if you must judge the “worth" of

these skills. then of course comic
books might not fit into your
favorite .’manifestation of culture
and environment.

But whether or not comic books
rate as “high class" stuff, the fact
remains they are a successful
medium._ Thus their appeal must
relate to something real and
valuable and important to their
readers.

Naturally you might balk at this
since this might mean
advertising slogans, cereal boxes,
pornography and bathroom-wall
poetry also would qualify as art.

It's just a matter of words
however, and to hold up Picasso
and Warhol or Da Vinci and Goethe
as “art" is to suggest that only
work enshrined in museums has
any cultural significance.

Well, that's wrong. Certainly,
the distinction between “high art"

Coffeehouse  

Women to Miami Invite

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Great Age of Swimming
began in Munich in 1972, when
Mark Spitz dove into the chlorinat-
ed depths. It ended about a week
later when he surfaced with seven
Olympic gold medals glinting from
his chest.

And the intense interest in
swimming was again limited to
those semi-amphibious creatures
whose hopes for Olympic triumphs
in '76 are second only to their big
goal—dt-‘veloping gills.

The Olympics are certainly in the

thoughts of the Pantherette swim- t

ming team as it competes at the
Miami Swimming and Diving
Invitational today and tomorrow.

“We've got a very good potential
to place high in almost every
event." said Head Coach Kate
Mathison.

“We still , lack depth——that‘s
what the big problem is—but we're
stronger in more events than last
year when we were strong in about
two. This year, we have a strong
person all the way around, one in

"Our divers (Connie Hister and
Jennie Brooker) are looking really
great—they should be ready for
this meet," Mathison said.

“They'll be diving both one and
three-meter."

The swimming categories are
individual events and relays—both
medley and free,-style. And .the
Pantherette credentials are im-
pressive. V ‘V
V Two-year all-American Angie
Lopez and free-styler Nila de Jesus
participated in the '75 Pan Am
games. .

Free-styler Kathy Stetler has
been invited to the Olympic
tryouts, and a bid also may be
offered to backstroker Jennifer
Price.

So. Pitt is almost waterlogged
with talent that's been practicing
dailyfor around eight weeks, and
the actual weekly competition
doesn't start until’ January.

“Actually, it (the Invitational) is
a little early in the season,”
Mathison admitted, “.but it breaks
up the monotony of the practices

and doesn't put as much pressure

on them.

"And, it gives us an indication
on our work and what we have to

concentrate on."

ready for anything,
improving last season’s 7-2 record.
“All of them are excited, I think
we can do really well,” Mathison
’ said.
“We'll probably end up breaking
every team record this week.”

“The Olympics are an incentive
because the swimming gets the
attention during the games. It

gives the team an extra boost.”

Why not’? After all, four long
years have gone by and anything

can happen. , .
