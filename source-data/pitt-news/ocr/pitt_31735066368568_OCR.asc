The S.S. Universe, the ship
usedfor the Semester at Sea pro- _
gram, ran aground'outside Egypt
last month and all\442 students
aboard are now dry-docked in
Jerusalem for several weeks.

i There were no injuries reported.

Dr. John Tymitz, the director,
of administrative affairs of the
Semester at Sea pr'ogram,.said
the ship ran aground onT,Fe”b. 25
during “extremely bad weather”
inthe Alexandria port. 182 stu-
dents were on board at the time
of the accident; ‘ ' I '

The director of the program,
Dr. Lloyd Lewan, has set up a

. temporary “campus” in Jerusa-
lem, and the -students are
expected to stay there until the -
end of March.

Tymitz said the schedule of the
voyage will have to be revised
andihe expects a two- to three-
'week delay of the ship’s home-
coming in San Francisco
originally scheduled for May 6.

The S.S. Universe is currently
on its way to Greece for inspec-

‘ tion and repair, he said.

What would you expect from a
lecture entitled, “Captive in Para-
disezj Feminist Criticism Meets
Literary History, the Frontier Expe-
rience and the Creature from the
Black Lagoon?” »

As part of the celebration for

Women’s History Week, Annette _

Kolodny, author of two books
about the American perspective of
captivity and researcher of literature
about feminist movements, deli-
vered this lecture yesterday.
Rather than reporting the end
product of her research, Kolodny
took both a historical and psycho-
analytic approach, as she took the
audience through the first 100 years
of “the first major American literary
genr_e”——the “captivity perspective.”
According to Kolodny, we have to
understand the historical context

' under which the image of the help-

less, “captive" woman still holds
today was formed.

“Little remains to tell us how
women viewed their new environ-

'ment as they crossed the ocean and

landed on these shores,” she said.
While many men made their for-

_tunes in America, women felt “shut

111),". ha_ving moved from civilized
England to the rough and rocky
New World. For most women, this

experience was a series of “enduring ,9

hardships.” .
Women could not, however, show
the anguish they felt overtheir situa-

' , tiO.,Il_; which is why “captivity” narra-

offeredymodels of passive forebear-
ance that many readers emulated.

They were an “emotionally safe”
channel in which women who had”
been forced to move westward could
express their frustrations over their
situation, Kolodny said.

“It was the only available contem-
porary form to mirror back contem-
porary woman’s captivity in the
frontier,” she said. ~

The first printed account of a New
England captivity narrative was
printed in 1682 by Mary Rowland-
son. The first of a series of women’s
captivity narratives provoked by the
New World ‘experience, Rowland-
son’s was also the first document
printed in America. It described a
woman’s journey through the Amer-
ican wilderness and showed how the
Puritans, who were settling in Amer-
ica, identified‘ themselves with“t~he
ancient Israelites. _

In the Puritans’ view, both the
settlers and the Israelites were cap-
tive, the former constantly being
invaded by the neighboring Indians
and the latter held captive by the
ancient Egyptians.

Literature suggests that the Puri-
tans viewed America as a “spiritual
wilderness," or another Babylon,
where women were often the temp-
tresses to sin, Kolodny said.

In Image of Judea- Copta, a pub-

V lished sermon, Cotton Mather sus-

  

tained the biblical identification. He
also,exp,o_se_d the vulnerability of a

_ 'society_,to the lndi_an.s,ﬂ and _in‘divi_d-'

   

 Women’s Literary Roles Examined

ual vulnerability as portrayed‘

2 through the captivity of one woman.

Other works of Mather deal with
the hunger, cold and exposure due
to inadequate clothing and other
hardships women faced when they
came to the New World.

Despite the popularity of a
number of male captive narratives,
the captivity of females (the “fearful
sex”) could be more easily identified

with the shrinking vulnerability also I

experienced by the biblical captive
Israelites, according to Kolodny.

In the late 1700s and early 1800s
the image of the captive female
became sensationalized. She became
the fictional “helpless heroine,”
Kolodny said.

Ann Eliza Bleecker’s History of
Maria Kittie, for example, por-
trayed the terrified woman help-
lessly wandering through the
wilderness.

This image has important impli-
cations in contemporary literature,
Kolodny said.

“We can see where this image be-
gins,” she said. “We’ve-seen it on
movies and television and certainly
in novels.”

Kolodny’s lecture was part of

Women’s History Week, which runs-

from March 6 to 12. It began in the
1920s “to commemorate women’s
rights that were being increased
around that_ time,” according to
Peggy Anderson of the Women’s
Center. ..

At Pitt Gridders

By MARK A. SINDLER

Discrepancies was the name of the
game at the preliminary hearing for
the two Pitt football players accused

of assaulting a policewoman on Feb. ‘

20. Police witnesses and defense
attorneys disagreed throughout
most of the four-hour hearing Wed-
nesday afternoon. '
Linebacker Dave Puzzuoli will
now stand trial on charges of aggra-
vated assault, simple assault, disor-
derly conduct, resisting arrest,
recklessly endangering another per-
son, terroristic threats and criminal
mischief. Dennis Atiyeh faces
charges of aggravated assault, disor-
derly conduct, resisting arrest, ter-
roristic threats and criminal

I fnischief’. Magistrate Donald Turner

threw out ll charges against the
players. , "

Atapproximately 1:40 a.m., Puz-
zuoli and Atiyeh were involved in a
donnybrook with seven city police
officers in the 3900 block of Forbes
Ave. when Puzzuoli allegedly
seriously injured officer DeVelma
Coleman. Both players were
charged with committing various
offenses.

Circumstances leading up to the
players’ brush with the police began
early Saturday evening when Puz-
zuoli was spotted by Officers John
Schwartzmeir and Carl Metz in the
doorway of a Forbes Ave. Chinese

, restaurant, “shouting and‘ holler-

ing,” according to Schwartzmeir. He
testified that Puzzuoli came up aside
the squad car and shouted, “Don't
forget Pearl Harbor.” Schwartzmeir
then asked Puzzuoli to leave the area
and go home, and the matter.was
seemingly resolved. _
Then, around 1:30 a.m. Sunday,
the same two officers were in the

3900 block of Forbes when Sgt.
Joseph Wind approached a double-‘
parked “late-model Eldorado” near
C.J. Barney’s. Puzzuoli was seen
talking to Atiyeh through the driv-
er’s window. Wind then asked that

the car be moved “since it was block- _

ing traffic.”

Sensing his irateness (Atiyeh said
that Wind had used excessive pro-
fanity when speaking to Puzzuoli.
Wind testified that he had not),
Atiyeh exited the car and told. Wind
he, would walk Puzzuoli to his dorm '

room. The car was later parked by

another passenger. Ten .minutes
later, Schwartzmeir said, he and

Metz were “cruising” down Forbes ~ 
and noticed both players shoving . a

each other around near the steps'
leading to the Towers.

Metz then proceeded to arrest
Puzzuoli
charges, but Atiyeh persisted in
intervening, saying Puzzuoli was all
right and “You’re not goingto arrest
my friend.” 0

Schwartzmeir testified that he had,-
already been “pushed and shoved
around” by Puzzuoli by the time two
other officers in the area arrived. At
this time, Metz attempted to place
Atiyeh under arrest but was hin-
dered by “[their] striking me with
clenched fists in the throat, mouth
and chest area."

K-9 officer Carl Warlock arrived,
followed shortly by Wind, who said
he saw that Puzzuoli had pinned

Warlock up against the hood of a car ._ ._

with the dog between them. When.
Puzzuoli was pulled off of Warlock,
he pummelled Wind and- had him in
a headlock, according to Wind.-
“He tookmy head and started
pounding it to the ground,” Wind
said. “He said, ‘I’m going to kill you.’

Because of the recent outbreak
of measles at Indiana University,
the Student Health Center is
planning to hold an immuniza-
tion clinic in early April, accord-
ing to Dr. Pamela Bowen,
medical administrator of the
center. .

Bowen said the Health Center
is worried about students carry-
ing the virus out oflndiana when
they leave for spring break.

Although many college stu-
dents were immunized as child-
ren, Bowen said the vaccine
administered prior to 1970 was
inadequate. It has since been
updated and is a more effective
vaccine. She urgesany student
who was not_vaccinated or was
yaccinated before /1 970 t-o get an

' immunization.
A “A lot of people out there

/

haven’t been immunized; and if ,
they have, it’s been ineffective,” '
she said. .

The athletic department
already issued immunizations to
its athletes because of the possi-
ble inter-collegiate play with stu-
dents from Indiana.

Bowen said that measles used
to be considered a “children’s
disease” because, before vaccines
were developed, the virus was
contracted mostly by children.-
Now, she said, the 10-day virus’

reaches all ages and it is not /4:“

minor illness. ‘

Bowen said that if students “
wish to be immunized before the ‘
Pitt clinic is set up, they can go to _
the State Health Department, at
3333 Forbes Ave. between 9 a.m. '
and 3:30 p.m. to receive free
immunization.

 Does Pitt Meet The

 

By'PATTl VISHNESKY

The Equal Rights Amendment
has yet to be passed, but women and
men across the United States con-

' tinue the battle. The role of women in

our society has changed dramati-
cally in the past two decades despite
the roller-coaster trends in the con-
temporary women's movements.
Women comprise 50 percent of
the population at Pitt but is the uni-
versity meeting the needs of these

- students? This week's Fon.rm exam-

ines this question at theconclusion

of Wornen’s History Week.

CA8 Advising

Dave Ludde, head of the College
of Arts and Sciences Advising Ofﬁce,
is somewhat wary as to whether the
courses are providing the approp
riate studies needed. '

"They could be better," Lude said,
adding that they should perhaps pro-
vide more exposure to women's
issues. For example, he said, the
courses don't contribute enough
toward the role of women in society.

According to lrene Frieze, speak-
ing as a member teaching psychol-
ogy in the women's studies program,
"The program has been providing
courses for both men and women for
the past 10 years and they are very
popular." The courses are not
career-oriented, she said, but are part
of the undergraduate program.

Business
School On

Schedule

By wes COTTER

The new Mervis Hall construction
is on schedule,~and the building will

be ready to house the Graduate‘

School of Business by the fall.
The progress in the construction
of the building, located behind the

Forbes Quadrangle, is proceeding at H

a rapid pace because of the mild win-
ter and the new modular concept
design of the building.

The $7 million dollar building has
several interesting features, includ-
ing an_ all glass exterior and an

‘advanced wiring system.

Raymond C. Damm, the project
coordinator, said, “the Graduate
School of Business is utterly delight-
ed. As the future unfolds, we could
conceivably have a computer at
every desk; it [the building] is wired
for the future. 

“It takes a little extra effort'to
build, but a facility like this will help
us do things much better. There’s no
reason in the world why CMU is
ahead of Pitt.”

Damm said the department anti-

‘cipates “being on the cutting edge as

a leader in business schools.”

The business department, accord-
ing to Damm, was looking down the
road when the building was
designed. '

The business department is cur-
rently housed in both the Cathedral
of Learning and Thackeray Hall
(old Mervis Hall). This separation
makes the department’s day—to-day
operations difficult. Damm
explained that the new facility will
house the entire faculty, MBA stu-
dents, a business library, adminis-
trators and the executive
development department.

Six classrooms and a behavioral
lab will be part of the three-story
facility, in addition to a number of
.offices.

' Construction is now on schedule,
but the project lost time in its early
stages when pillars and other parts
of the Forbes Field were unearthed.
During the project's first excava-
tion, large concrete supports were
discovered and had to be removed.

Further problems with large
amounts of mud bogged down

progress but were taken care of and

the construction resumed. Good

- weather during the winter months -
A helped make up for lost‘ time.-

 

Beverly Harris-Schenz, of the
Office of the Dean of the College of '
Arts and Sciences, said that she
would rather see the university curric-
ulum as a whole integrate theinter-
ests of women in its courses so that
they better relate to the student body
as a whole.

 
    
   
    
   

women students at the university is
increasing all the time," Frieze said,
"the various departments don't
seem to have given this fact much
thought. It could beneﬁt both the
women and the university if experi-
mental courses in the women's stu-
dies program were available." ’

The College of_Arts and Sciences

H’; previously provided funding for

experimental studies in all depart-

' ments, but those funds fell victim to

budget cuts. '

JanetDeal ' "
Office of Continuing

"The Ofﬁce of Continuing Educa-

/’ tion does everything but transport

them [women] to school and study
for them," said Janet Deal, ofﬁce
Director.

The ofﬁce, founded in 1964,
recruits women for the university. It
also registers for women who can't
afford to hire babysitters for the time
it takes to stand in line at Thackeray

"Although the percentage of ' * Hall,

The ofﬁce counsels all students. ‘

letting them know what opportuni-
ties are available to them after they
acquire their degrees.

As far as Deal is concerned, the
university is trying to do its share of
providing adequate services for its
women students. The only improve-

ments she said she believes could be

made would be the provision of
more funding and aid for the women.
But she added that it is hard to ask for
that because there has been such a
cmnch put on all university funding
these days. However, she added, Pitt

"should try to exhaust state and fed- ’-

eral funding."

When the university funded a__
women's center, its services were
also made available to non-students.
After the center was discontinued
due to lack of funds, the Oakland
Women's Center on Forbes Avenue
responded by opening its sen/ices to
Pitt students.

Ludde said he believes the,

Women's Center on the campus is
deﬁnitely beneﬁcial because of ' its
attempts to raise both women's and
the university's consciousness of
women in society.

House Appropriations Committee in Harrisburg that
numbers are not important when compared to the
promotion and retainment of minority faculty. He is
right, but only partly.

It is not so much that Pitt can report 5.3 percent of
its tenured faculty is minority or that 8 percent of the
students are minority students, it’s the areas in which
they are found.

Women, for example, make a large -part of Pitt’s
population, but for the most part, they occupy spaces
in programs congruent with traditional roles such as
nursing, psychology and social work. Black faculty. is
also inequitably distributed. Pitt would like to see

Attempts to correct the imbalance in terms of fig-

and the quality of advising must also be examined.

Getting the students here is only half the battle;
retaining them, motivating them and providing them
with role models are areas which can always be
improved.

Letters To The Editor

Football Players Must Pay Fame Dues

Dear Editor:

I am writing in response to the
Feb. 25 “Forum” article entitled

“if he or she [a Pitt athlete] becomes
involved in an incident, it seems to
be that he is given more publicity
than the non-athlete.”

No kidding. Of course, this is
going to happen, and I think every
Pitt football player should be well
aware of this. Every player locally,

and to some extent, nationally, can.

be considered a general public
figure. _
By law, one can be considered to

- be a_ general public ﬁgure after a

clear showing of “general fame or
notoriety. in the community...”
(Gertz vs. Robert Welch lnc., 418
U.S. 323). Don’t you feel that Pitt’s

football -team carries.with it locally ‘

and nationally a sense of fame and
notoriety? I certainly do. On top of
that, oncetthis image ofa public fig-

he did not ﬁnd problems with ath-
letes any more frequentethan with
other students—meaning be

this stuff happen to us.” Before
what, Dwight? I can only remember
two recently published incidents-

one was unfortunate and both were .

concerning the football department.
Why does Dwight say “athletes” (a
generalization)? Don’t bring Pitt’s
other athletic departments into the
football department. _

Also, Collins says he finds that
there is a stereotype about “athletes”
on campus. Again, I think he should
be saying a stereotype about football
players, not athletes. Also, this ste-
reotype of which he speaks has been

developing for some time now, itjust
didn’t appear overnight. Anyway,
why would students make up an
image of 6-5, 280-lb. guys walking

think Pitt students want to look up
to and feel proud of their football
team. We know that they are out
there practicing hard every day to
represent us on the ﬁelds. However,
this representation goes far beyond
the football ﬁeld. Give us something

to be proud of, not make excuses-

for.

Remember, you guys are in the
spotlight—use it to your advantage
so we can all walk tall.

the entire Pitt football team must
realize that along with the headlines
and cheers goes a very keen and
watchful public eye. They are not

public safety, about not feeling “that
last weekend's incident warrants any
extra measures on the part of the
police,” I feel, is a comment coming
from the other side ofthe fence. Let’s
have one of Pitt's security guards get

‘slammed. around a few times, and

see if Watters doesn't see to it that
things don’t tighten up around cam-
pus security-wise.

Charles Nucci, owner or Z‘elda’s
and C.J. Bar_ney_‘s, talks in circles

with his‘ co‘rnmen\ts.jHe ﬁrst said that.

Dear Editor:

I was fascinated by Mark
Sindler’s column in the Wednesday,

and religious freedom. At the same
time, he opposes The Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA), saying that
women belong “in the domestic
environs raising moral and responsi-
ble children." .

A true believer in freedom would
say that a woman belongs where
ever she wants to belong, either rais-
ing children, workingor both astshe

w ‘r; .~ ..  _  

sees fit. That’s why the Libertarian
Party and my own Commonwealth

Party have endorsed the ERA. Any
other position is inconsistent with

“saves the taxpayer $20,000 a year
per life sentence" also seems curi-
ously unethical. -

l’ll debate Mr. Sindler publicly o‘i'i
ERA, the death penalty or both ifhe
agrees and the appropriate univer-
sity authorities approve it.

Barton Levenson

He tried to gauge my eyes, was twist-
ingsmy head and attempted to put
his ﬁngers in my mouth.”

It was now that Coleman, the
policewoman, testified that Puz-
zuoli eventually released Wind, got
up off the sidewalk, picked her up by
both legs, turned her upside down
and threw her into the street.

“My legs wouldn't move, I
couldn’t get up,” Coleman said. “I
used my arms to get up on [a car’s]
fender.’f - .
“- Coleman— also testified that she
suffered a concussion, nerve damage
(she refused to elaborate on that
when questionedby Ray Radako-
vich, Puzzuoli’s attorney) and
numbness in her arms and legs as a
result of the melee.

Wind said at the hearing that
when this occurred,.he got to his feet
and attempted to stop Puzzuoli,

I who he-said was attempting to ﬂee.

.2”-Ix

Wind said he lunged at_him and
tackled Puzzuoli by grabbing his
right leg. Wind then described how
he got Puzzuoli in a “headlock grip
and dragged him to the wagon.”

Wind said he was in a crouched
position pulling—Puz_zuoli into the
wagon while other officers pushed.
Atiyeh, unhandcuffed, was already
in the wagon. Wind‘ said that when
he attempted to exit the wagon, still
in his crouched position, Atiyeh
swung his legs-around and kicked
him out. '

Both players were then taken to '

Presbyterian and Centr_al Medical

Pavillion Hospitals, where they
refused any treatment. Both were
later booked at the Public Safety
Building. . - .
Contacted by The Pitt News after
the hearing ended at 6:30. p.m.,
Atiyeh gave a different account of

- what occurred during different

stages of the ‘fracas. He -said that
Metz and Schwartzmeir followed
him and Puzzuoli within two min-
utes of being wameébby Wind and
“were looking to follow every move
wemade.”

Atiyeh continued, “The Metz guy
had it in his mind to do what he had
to do. They never had a reason to
arrest us. In fact, if you tried to
recount the way they tried to lead up
to the whole incident, you’d see they
had no proof in any way to arrest us.

“They never even stated the rea-
son they arrested Dave.” \

Sam Sciullo, .Atiyeh’s attorney,
agreed. He claims the justiﬁcation

L for the arrest was not evident at the

hearing. -

“There was never‘ cause for
arrest,” he said. “They weren't jas-
tling. Only Schwartzmeir and Metz
talked about jostling, but I know at
least eight people who saw it, and
there was absolutely no jostling.”

Sciullo further said that both
Schwartzmeir and Metz used undue
discretion -in their decision to arrest
Puzzuoli. "

‘-‘No one was being affected by
Puzzuo1i_and Denny,” Sciullo said.
“To have disorderly conduct, you

have to have other people affected.

“Scwartzmeir said in testimony
no one was on the sidewalk at the
time. Then Metz came out and said
there were 10 people. He said no one
came up to him to complain about
the two boys. No one was being
bothered,” Sciullo added. “It is a
crime when someone intends to via-
late the other person without his
permission.” -
Sciullo is looking to the date of
the trial when the defense will show,
through medical records, that Cole-
man never suffered a fractured neck
or any other serious injuries. ‘Offic-
ers at the hearing also did.not recall‘
seeing» Puzzuoli pick _ Coleman up
and throw her. They all testified that
they only saw her on the ground.
Sciullo also said that he has access
to a witness who said he saw Metz-
who claimed to have suffered cartil-
age damage in his left shoulder after
a confrontation with Atiyeh—

washing his car last Sunday. Both _

Coleman and Metz are currently on
leave without compensation.

Both Atiyeh and Sciullo agreed
that the officers used excessive force
the morning of Feb. 20. Atiyeh said

‘he and Puzzuoli were not hand-
cuffed, that morning , but “walked
peacefully to the van. We put our-
selves into the van.”

“There were discrepancies in what

the police. were saying [Wednes-
day],” Sciullo said. “These guys are
dumb. Tell the truth, damn . it.
Because even if the truth hurts a little
bit, it sounds better. But when you
lie...nobody believes what you say.”

Few bands—rock, pop, soul,
whatever—have the integrity or the
capacity to stretch their material any
further thanstudio technology will
take it, meaning that what is deli-

record as possible. While some are
inspired to deviation by their
audience-(i.e. Der Bas Springsteen),

have every reason not to tamper-with
their success-proven musical
formulas. *

Still, there they were, A adding
brash guitar work to confections like
”Kiss On My List" and "Did It In A
Minute," or pumping throbbing bass
lines through the seltzer fizz "Pri-
vate Eyes.” And yet, every new turn
this band took only left a lethargic
and preoccupied audience increas-
ingly apathetic in its response.

’ From the opening number "I-'am_ily
Man," this duo proved again that by
wrapping themselves around one of
the most professional and exciting

It would probably be a few glances at
the program on the way home,
maybe a bite to eat before dropping

of the night. Great shows like this
are too rare to be filed away under
"just another night out.” Rock-n-roll

again, who ever confused Pitts-

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

  
  

 v'This was apparent the minute he
walked into the Century Plaza Hot-
el's Western Room — a half hour ear-
lier than he was scheduled to. Most of
1? the press people hadn't finished their
‘* breakfast yet, and Sheen was all
ready to talk. Moreover, he wanted to
talk——a .rare attitude in Hollywood's
usual atmosphere of silence.
His is the gaze of a man possessed
with an inexplicable spirit. Sheen's
eyes pierce, twinkle, glint and glare
until everyone at the table is mesmer-
ized. His fiery pupils betray his cool
angular exterior and hint that
beneath is a man who thinks a lot—
maybe too much. His conscience is
 extensive, and during the next half
I - "hour, he will unleash it on those wil-
ling to listen. He does not seem con-
cerned with any of the press’
reactions as he doesn't pad his com-
ments with the usual obligatory bull-‘
shit. Some of the things he says are
' sh”ocking, but one thing‘ is sure;
Sheen does not harbor many
. illusions.
Sheen's film career has been a quiet

turning heads in Catch 22 and The Sub-
ject Was Roses, going on to make a ser-
ies of_TV-movies such as Badlands, a
dramatization of the Charles Stark-
weather slaying, and The Little Girl
Who Lives Down The Lane. Nonetheless,
his most memorable contribution to
filmdom was Apocalypse Now in which
_ he played the army captain opposite
‘ Brando—a role that clinchedghis claim
to film stardom.

The Dayton, Ohio, native’s latest
‘ cinematic effort is a small part in

Walker. According to Sheen, the
character is an amalgam of several
pressmen who followed the Mahat-
ma's "life, but is largely a tribute to
writer Vincent Sheean who authored
Lead Kindly Light, a westerner’s inter-
pretatidn of Gandhi's life.
‘ Though Sheen's part in Gandhi was
minor, the impact that the movie and
‘ the country had on him was quite the
I opposite. He admits that he had trepi-
dations about going to India because
o\f\ac~counts~ of extreme poverty that
others had related to him. His eyes
convey the truth of these tales as he
describes his own experience.

_"It's overwhelming; you just get

Martin Sheen is one intense man. s

but acclaimed one. He first started I

Gandhi as a western journalist named ‘

assault_ed—every sense is assaulted,
and you have to surrender to it if
you're going to grow at all,” he says.
"For me, it was a turning point
because’ it brought me in touch with
my spiritual center, as it were——I
don't know of any better word to
express that. As a result ofwhat I saw
in India and how it impressed me, it
was the end of a long search for me,
and I returned to being a practicing

Catholic...."
"While Gandhi proved

el'h

to be an

Apocalypse Now was not. Although, it
has been billed as his strongest per-
3» formance, it was a role that almost
7’ killed him. There were reports that

"“ he suffered a heart attack on the set '

U, of Apocalypse, but he does not verify
l_'.'.F'this, saying instead that the expe-
n-1 rience was "absolutely hideous.”

He does not place any blame on
Francis Ford-Coppola, however, say-
ing that he holds himself solely

it was me. I don't blame anyone else
for my self-inflicted wounds. I
wanted to be a movie star; I wanted to
be in that film," he says. "I risked my

life, I_ risked my spirituality, I risked
the absence of moral courage-
everything....I thought I was my ego;
I thought I was my career. We're not
our careers—our careers are projec-
tions of our egos—~any more than
we're not our clothes, our homes or
our cars. ‘We're not those things;
we're just made to think we are."
The subject of Gandhi resurfaces
and so does Sheen's spiritual side. He
sees a greatnecessity for the movie-—
a need that has arisen out of the fierce

"political/military shellgame that he

sees being played. "These are real
perilous times now because we are
operating under the shadow of a
great evil—_that of the nuclear arms
race...It's a very crucial time, a time of
great courage, and if the spirit of
Gandhi can be revived in this country
to the extent that he can represent an
alternative to this madness," he says
and falters. "He said in the film, ’I
"know a way out of hell.’ How chilling
that thought is...that's inspiring;
that's about love. That's about our
potential—it's really what we must
achieve whether it's going to be in
our lifetime or 10 or 12 lifetimes. We
might as well get it on because one of
those hideous, obscene weapons can
rock this planet from its axis." ’

It is here that Sheen's voice begins
to take on an angry tone. His gaze is
glaring and anyone tearing himself
away from the conversation would
realize that he is practically yelling.
People from surrounding\tables are
beginning to turn their heads: they
can sense Sheen's ire and are curious.
The discussion is beginning to take a
political cast as he encompasses world
leaders _with his scorn. _

"We have these blind leaders who
are not in. touch with the truth.
Gandhi's whole message was the
truth," he says. "The truth never
changes and never will. It's only
rediscovered by men like Gandhi-

't_hat's courage, that's heroism, and

it's more necessary today than ever
before." I

He is not done. He says that the
leadership that the Mahatma repres-
ented could never be found within
the American governmental struc-
ture and goes on, unmercifully, to
cite Reagan as an example. "Would
you aspire to the sort of leadership
that we have in the Whitehouse now?
This old, has-been actor; this bully,
this moral bully...kissing the asses of

the millionaires around him for all
these‘ years? He was the president of
the Screen Actors Guild for years,
and you saw what, he tried to do to Ed
Asner," he says, his eyes—shining with
anger. "He's a bully...There's not a
man or woman, in fact,.there are very
few women and very few minorities
around him—I don't see anybody
around him that ever worked for a
living, that ever packed a lunch. Look
at those bastards, they're dead".
There's no spirit going on in there-
it's all calculative. Come on, there are
people hungry in this country... and
you still have a military budget that
overwhelms everything else. What's
more is that the large portion of
investments that these major compa-
«ies are making off our tax money is
invested overseas." ~
The tirade is almost complete.
Sheen seems to have realized that he
has beenpontificating for some time,
and hisseyes soften their focus. "You
know what Mother Theresa said on
her last visit to America?" he asks
rhetorically. "She said, ’It's a lot easier
to deal with the dead and dying on the
streets of Calcutta than it is the moral
I bankruptcy and the absence of spirit-
uality in America.’ " He pauses,,and
everyone realizes how hushed it is at
the table. He smiles_almost apologeti-
cally but says nothing. I

"They're gonna kick your ass‘if you
stand up and say something. Listen,
it's no different than it was 2,000
years ago," he explains. "Whenever
you stand up and bear witness to the
truth, and it doesn't fit in to the pres-
ent philosophy or financial structure,
they're gonna get rid of you...Martin

Luther King was 39 when he was

assassinated, Christ was 32 when he
was crucified. Me, I'm 42, and I ain't
done shit." I

Somehow, that last statement
doesn't seem true. There is an urge to
tell him that, but everyone just sits
there. The half hour is over, and it is
time for Sheen to move on. Before he
leaves, he apologizes in an odd way.
"Forgive me for not listening
enough," he says. "I should be
listening."

It is a strange comment, but it
might provide a clue to this man
whose intense desire for the truth
can be seen in his gaze: .perhaps

. Sheen has found that one of the

secrets to-truepersonal success is
keeping one’s ear to the ground.

By DANA B. POLAN

David Cronenberg’s typical detrac-
tors attack him as one of the horror
film's most mindless purveyors of
cheap thrills (the critics’ usual point
of reference or attack is the exploding
head "in Scanners). And yet, Cronen-
berg may actually be the horror film's
most cerebral L director, a thinker
whose grotesque effects are efforts
to visualize intriguing philosophical
problems.

the order of the day, where ”normal"
ways of life can all too easily reveal
their potential abnormality and
absurdity, Cronenberg’s films ask us
to think about the constraints (physi-
cal, mental, political, biological) of the
limited frames within which we all
too often build our lives. Cronen-
berg’s films ask us to think about our

thoughts, through the ‘horrific possi-
bility of seeing those desires, emo-
tions and thoughts made flesh. In

&lThey Cizme From Within, sexual desire

takes physical form in the shape of
aphrodisiac parasites; in The Broad, a
woman gives birth to creatures that

murderous Id; in Scanners, espionage
agents can kill through psychic
powers. A

reality—television—-and brilliantly
suggests the horror that festers
within. The film's central idea is over-
powering in its simplicityrwhat if tel-
evision weren't simply part of "our
lives, but was our lives"? What if our
minds were finally no more that
extension of the television's own
mind? Cronenberg here follows the
premises of the late Canadian theor-
ist of the new media, Marshall McLu-
han (parodied in the film by a media
guru named Brian O'Blivion), who
argued that television would become
a new sensory organ, giving us per-

ception beyond our wildest imagina-

tions. Cronenberg, though, finally
reverses McLuhan to argue the possi-
bility that we could become organs of
television—we could turn into
machines as programmable as the
video-recorder: one of the film's
grossest images shows‘ how the bad
guys rip open the hero's stomach to

insert video cassettes to give him the"

wildest and most dangerous of hor-
ror shows inside his own head.

Videodrome asks us what reality can .

mean in a video age. What is sub-
stance? What is mere fiction? Where
are the boundaries? Is a human life
still human if itexists only as pieces of
recorded tape ‘(several of the charac-
ters in the story have died and only
exist as memory
television)?‘
Videodrome's story gives us the
world as a media event. Hero Max

traces on

/
Iames Woods stars as M

Renn (James Wood) lives television-
waking up to its ima_ge, speaking on
talk~shows, working for a cable com-
pany. His journey to find meaning in
his life is a journey to find the right
image, one capable of surpassing all
others.

In a world where images come to

have more life than real events, .

Max's world is the extreme of artifi-
ciality and mass production. Filmed in
Toronto (a city that has modernized
so quickly as to banish all traces of its
pre-‘plastic past), Videodrome gives us
an image of a society dominated by a
radical repression of tradition. In
Videodrorne, bums go to the local mis-
sion not for soup and sermons, but
for .more exposure to the TV.
Playing his part as if he had caffeine
for blood, Wood shows acharacter
who has lost all life and is nothing but
a‘ series... of twitches in». response to
media stimuli. In perhaps the film's
greatest coup, Renn’s girlfriend,
Nikki Brand, a radio psychologist
who trades cliches for real analysis, is
played by Blondie's Deborah Harry.
Since Harry (and Blondie) exist as the
calculated results of media hype (as

 Renn in David Cronenberg’s Videodrome.

 8 *i;1'>agé~'1.1“  7”‘

 
 
     

with Brooke Shields, the target of
Blondie's song ”Pretty Baby"), she is a
perfect choice for the role of the
media.-transfixed Nikki. Halfway
through the film, Nikki leaves for
Pittsburgh (!!!), the origin of the
Videodrome conspiracy that Renn is
trying to uncover, and she returns
only as a TV image, a commentary on
the way any person (including a
Deborah Harry) can only become
important today by becoming a media
event.

Videodrome will surprise (and per-
haps bother or disturb) movie-goers
who assume that the only form for
the horror film today is the splatter
and slash form of films like Friday the
13th. Cronenberg gives us a horror
closer to home—the horror of the
new electronic world we are con-

structing for ourselves (according to 1

statistics, the average American
watches more than 6 hours of televi-
sion a day). The film is sci-fi horror,

' savagely regarding our world and

suggesting that our most apocalyptic
visions don't begin to capture the
mondo-bizarro chaos that is already
scrambling around in our brains.

  vP‘age‘l4— L

By CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE

Peter Brook once compared a
theater director to a guide who leads
a band of travellers through
unknown territory while wearing a
blindfold. At some point, presuma-
bly, the director becomes familiar
with the lay of the land, and his blind-
fold falls away. In others, the director
never perceives the nature of the ter-
ritory and blithely leads his actors off
a steep --cliff into an abyss of
confusion. ’ ' .

Such was the case in Matthew

L Vaky’s last directing effort for the

Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre, Sam
Shepard’s The Tooth of Crime. And,
sadly, Vaky’s blindfold is still firmly
in place for his current PLT offering,
Iohn Guare’s Landscape of the Body. The
directing problems are so similar that
one can think of Landscape as Tooth: Part

Showcase, Friday March 11, _l983

11 (you know, ”]ust when you thought .
it was safe to go back to the

theatre...”).

Like Tooth, Landscape is a difficult
script which demands much guidance
and intelligent interpretation from
its director. Centering on the murder
of a teenage boy and told in film—like
flashbacks, the play flows from real-
ism, to expressionism and even. to
musical theatre. Almost unerringly,
Vaky leads the actors in the wrong
direction. Moments which call for
truth are played in a mannered, artifi-
cial style; expressionistic sequences
are played as if they were realism.
The effect is mass confusion. Vaky
has not discovered what the play is
about, and.as the audience, neither do
we. -
Vaky’s actors can not be faulted,
for the most part. They are a solid,
talented castt and it's rather painful

to watch them struggle in an attempt
to make some sense out of the
evening. ‘ .
Renee Henry has some good
moments as Betty Yearn, the mother

F of the murdered boy. As written, the

role requires her to display an almost

- schizophrenic personality. Betty has

adopted the personality of her dead
sister, a porno-flick queen who has
been cut_down in the prime of life by a
careless bicyclist. She displays one
face to the police investigating the

’ murder and another to her son. She
‘ also must play her original, whole-

some self. Vaky has left her unguided
in the transitions; there is nounity to
her performance.

David Neal, a young professional
who has worked for the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival, does a fine job
with Bert, Betty's son. G.W. Rooney
is delightful in a series of character

through March 27.) . 

'Landscape’Director Needs A Map   f

roles, including the cyclist, the ”Dope
King of Providence” and a bank teller.
Douglas Pona turns in his usual
excellent work as Raulito, who runs a
travel agency scam in the village. Bob
Wenzel is superb as Durwood Peach,
a mentally disturbed‘ ice cream
vendor who seeks Betty's hand in
marriage.

The best performance of the evﬁ 
ing, though, is Patricia Grace §'
Rosalie, Betty's dead sister. Serving
as a sot of narrator for the piece and
singing a number of hauntingly cyni-
cal songs, Grace seems to be the only
member of the company who has any
idea what the play is about. Unfortu-
nately, it isn't enough to save this
confusing Landscape.

Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre

_-’Three

Sisters’

By LINDA HENRY

For the first time since separating
from the speech department, the
University of Pittsburgh theatre
department is staging a classic drama
cast solely with theater majors and
featuring many of the graduate stu-
dents enrolled in its developing mas-

ters of fine arts program. Three Sisters

by Anton Chekhov opens Friday
night in Stephen Foster Memorial

_ Theatre and will run through March

26.

Director Gillette Elvgren, who has
been with Pitt for 12 years, feels the
text of Three Sisters offers the acting
student a "perfect meeting with the
methodology learned in the masters
acting program under Steve Cole-
man." Most educational institutions
teach the Stanislowsky method of
finding the ”innermotivational core”

of a character, and Chekhov demands
an actor to search for this Center. ’’He‘

requires a versatile range, both in the

age of his characters (from 205 to 60s)
and in their emotions,” says Elvgren.

“This is an advantage to having the

MFA actors to work with. They are

high caliber students, combining

serious dedication and fun in a wond-
erful, creative atmosphere.”

There are seven MFA students in
the cast of Three Sisters, and the range
of their personal goals and desires
within the theater is as wide as the
characters they will portray. Maria
Barney who plays Masha, one of the
sisters of the play’s title, is a second-
year acting student in theemasters
program from Slatington, Pennsyl-
vania. She came to Pitt from Point
Park College where she started as a
criticism major before switching to
acting. Her involvement with the

/th eater began between her junior and

senior-year in high school when she

took college courses specifically for

drama at Cedar Crest in Allentown.
This led to her work that summer
with the Guthsville Playhouse, _ a
semi—professional Comedia del Arte
Troupe that wandered the st/reetsof
Allentown with their props and back-
drop placards until finding an
audience group to watch their
improvisational performances. Ms.

“Ruth Lesko is the most powerful actress in Pittsburgh

Donald Miller
Pittsburgh Post- Gazette

Barney's first production in Pitt_s—
burgh was at the Playhouse Junior in

Granny Applebutter and~the Ding-Dong

Wolf by William Leech. .

The other two sisters in the pro-
duction are Olga, played by Tere
Eglar, also an MFA acting student;

and Irina, as portrayed by Mary Io

Kelly, an undergraduate and new
mother married to MFA directing
student Richard Ewing.

Ewing is in his first year in the mas-
ters program and plans to continue

studying toward a Ph.D. in theater .

with the goal of teaching at a univer-
sity. He wishes to do commercial
work aswell. His new role as father
of a one-month-old ‘baby gives his
work focus, and he states that both
he and his wife, though theater peo-
ple, believe ”real life takes precedence
over the artificial life which the

theater is.” He is particularly excited _

to be doing Chekhov, playing

Lieutenant-Colonel and Battery‘

Commander Alexander Ignatievich
Vershinin.

The male lead, the three sisters"
brother, Andrei Prozorov, is being
played by Douglas Krizner, a second-
year MFA acting student. Krizner
follows the philosophy of taking each

V working for. WWSW, which provided

day one at a time, which has been the

game plan for his involvement in’§§.‘:~ .

theater in the first place. From hig
"school drama, he fell into radio,

him with money to goto undergradu-
ate school. He has no concrete plans
for the future other than marketing
his voice and continuing with com-
mercial work. ”I don't mind acade-
mia,” Krizner says, ”but I have to
escape from it from time to time.” He
was also seen in the last two Shakes-
peare Festivals here at Pitt.

Other MFA students featured in
Three Sisters include Pat Hicok, (seen

last semester in the title role of I.y§'is=“ ' '

trata), Steven Brown and Michele
Macau.

Most of the students in the masters
of fine arts program are on assistant-
ships and plan to go on with commer-
cial work after completing their
degrees in either theater or other
communications media, according to
Elvgren. ”The program offers the
basic groundwork for all communica-
tions media with itsstudy of realistic,
presentational and Elizabethan per-
formance," he says, ”as well as offer-
ing practical work both inthe studio

and on imainstage. 33.. "

On ,a balmy autumn day four

;;é\je—ars ago, a lanky freshmansporting

a red sweat.band around strawberry
shoulder“-length hair,. ambled into

the"Trees Hall gymnasium. The.

mere sight of this odd freshman

jstartled Frank D’Amico, coach of
‘ the Panther Gymnastics team.

“What would this confused fresh-

Smart, lookinglike a radical 60’s rem-

.1‘-

nant be doing in a gym? D’Amico
wondered. When the freshman
approached him, introducing him-
self as Mike Lloyd and saying he
wished to try‘"o_ut for the gymnastics
team, D’Amico was indeed shocked.

“I was terrible back then,” Lloyd

admitted. “I could hardly walk
across the gym floor without
tripping.” .
 Lloyd’s unathletic physique was
deceiving, ‘for he did have gymnas-
tics experience. He was the victim of
declining enrollments and rising
athletic costs at Rochester High
School when its gymnastics pro-
gram was cut in l977.

“All I wanted was a chance,”
Lloyd said.

That is all D’Amico gave—a
chance.

D’Amico had little notion then
that Lloyd would one day turn into
one of the best side horse specialists
in Pitt ’s history.

“It was a spur of the moment
thing,” Lloyd explained. “I guess I
wanted to, prove to myself: that I
could be an athlete.” .

Although Lloyd was given a
chance, he was not given the same
rights as his teammates ‘until he
proved himself. Lloyd spent a great
deal of his workout time in a damp
storage room he called “the Cooler.”
The Cooler had no side horse, only a
buck (a ‘small version of a horse).
And it was there that Lloyd nutured
his dedication and athletic talent.

“Being in the Cooler really moti-
vated me,”Lloyd said. “I wanted to
become so good that Frank would
have to put the whole team in there
with me.” .

Towering at 6-6, taller than the
average gymnast, Lloyd was at a dis-
advantage.‘ “I have a lot more to
swing around,” Lloyd said. But
height did not shrink Lloyd’s
determination. '

“When I joined the team I told
Frank, ‘You, may not like me now,

‘but I am going to contribute before

Lloyd lived up to his vow whenhe

into a 13-point deﬁcit. Then, the
Redmen went into the locker room
at halftime with visions of Villanova

in their heads.

“Take away that one stretch in the
first half, and we played pretty much
head up,” Panther coach Roy Chip-
man said’. “Billy Goodwin just shot
us out of the game. Everything he

shot went into the goal.”

,. Chipman pulled a 3-2..zone out; of
his coaching closet tht stiﬂed St.

John’s outside game early on. 5‘

“We were surprised to see the 3-2 ‘
zone,” St. John’s coach Lou Carne- _
secca said. “It ‘bothers you even
more when you’re missing the

shots.”

Pitt held St. John’s sophomore
scoring machineiChris Mullin to.two
baskets in the first half, but St.
John’s adjusted and began to get the
ball inside to its big men.

 

ke Lloyd

Lloyd’s ambitions were fueled by his
accomplishments and he was deter-
mined to get better. . .

In order to reach his lofty goal,
Lloyd applied a special philosophy.

“I always said, to be the best, you
got to train harder than the best.”_

Gymnastics is unlike many season
sports—it takes year—round practice
to begin to master an event. This is
where Lloyd excelled, as he
explained.

“It is easy to practice in the middle
of the season when everyone else is
working realhard,” he said. “But it is
real difficult to practice when
nobody else is—like in the middle of
the summer.” '

In the summer months‘, Lloyd
borrowed a side horse from his high
schol and put himself through a
daily practice session. The regi-
mented training finally payed off

~ when he became a starter his sopho-

more year.

Lloyd has been given the nick-
name of “Teke” because of his
remarkable "resemblance to the
Pirates’ ace reliever KentTekulve.

Lloyd has developed into a master
of the side horse. His season scoring
average hovers around 9.05 and he
currently holds the side horse record
(9.35m which he achieved in the
international Soviet team meet in
November). And for the past three
meets, Lloyd has captured first
place. _

-Lloyd's excellent average may
qualify him.for‘the national cham-

_ pionships this year.

" The motivation Loyd has on the
side horse‘ hasbeen transmitted to J

The difference between last Satur-
day’s massacre and the game here
was the Panthers’ ability to control
St. .John’s running game. A late
arriving_Madison Square Garden
crowd remained a non—factor until
Williams drove to the hoop at the

v 16:30 mark and slammed home a

wind-up dunk. .
“That shot sparked us,” Goodwin

. said. “It got us up; where as before,

we were playing kind of lazy.”

St. J ohn’s appeared eager to
prove Chipman’s mid-we_ek pro-
phecy: the Redmen would be a little

' bit cocky.» '

Carnesecca took Chipman’s lead

‘ and came with a wrinkle of his own,
a pressing 2-3 half-court zone _

defense which rattled the previously
patient Panther offense.

“We weren’t»psychologically pre-
pared for their zone,” Chipman said.

“Our forwards were cut too far, and
we just couldn’t put the ball in the
basket.” ‘

The Panthers once again got lop-
sided‘ scoring, as Clyde Vaughan
contributed his usual 23 points while
center Andre Williams was the only
other Pitt player ‘in double ﬁgures
with 12.

“I thought we lost our patience on
offense,” Chipman said. “We’ve
played well against zones all year
round, and Ithink our guys got a
little too big.” _ ‘ ’

Chipman inserted early-season
sensation Joey David into the lineup
in the second half in_ an attempt to
initiate some scoring, but the fresh-

man’s six points were too little and .

too late in their arrival.

The loss sends the Panthers home
without any expectations of a post-
season tournament invitation, but

this team of only one senior—’l‘rent
Johnson—lo.oked' ahead to the
future.

‘‘It’s helped us a lot,” Chipman
said of hisfirst season in the Big

_East. “It’s the best conference in the

country, and with a player or two,
we can be more competitive in the
future.”~ ‘

The Panthers’ lack of depth was
glaring in the second half as Carne-
secca ‘ran fresh players into the game
against a. tired Pittstarting five.

Chipman countered with David
and Chip Watkins, but they weren’t
enough. Johnson watched the ﬁnal
10 minutes of his playing career at
Pitt from the bench. The fatigue of a
long season had ‘taken its ﬁnal toll

‘if:

on the Panthers, who finished the _

season with a 13-15 record.

Six members of the Panther
track team will be running for
All-America honors this wee-
kend at the NCAA indoortrack
and field championships at- the
Silverdorne in Pontiac, Mich.

Panthers have qualified in
three different events'—the 60-
yard high hurdles, the 1,000-yard
run and the two-mile relay.
Sophomore Roger Kingdom will
be running the 60-yard hurdles,
junior Todd Colas will compete
in the l,000-yard run, and
seniors Darren Geary and Terry
Gallagher and juniors Garland
Brown and Bill Moorhead will
run the two-mile relay.

The competition is second to
nonevat the NCAA meet, but
these six Panthers have proven
throughout the season that they
can compete against high-caliber
runners. .

“When you’re dealing with the
level of competition that exists in
an NCAA-type meet, consis-
tency is the most important_
thing,” said Pitt coach John Vas-
v_ary. “Both Roger in the hurdles
and Todd in the 1,000 have been
very consistent all year. They
have competed against quality
competition all year, and there is
no reason why they don‘t stand
as good a chance as anybody.-

:..‘-‘The.tw'o-rnile- e_ v."=V_4.sv»arv'- :

 

 

continued, “has proven time and
again that they can compete with
the best and win. Their victories

» at the Mason-Dixon games and

the Eastman Kodak Invitational
are a good indication of what
they are capable of.

“Everyone competing this
weekend is shooting for the top.
They all believe that they can do
it. I hope we can return with six
All-Americans.”

In reference to any strategy

that the Pitt runners might use
Vasvary said, “The biggest goal
is to make it to the ﬁnals. They
have to run the trials as if they
were the finals because if they
don’t make the ﬁnals, it's all
over. .
“The competition doesn't just
include Americans. In fact, we
will probably have the only all-
American two-mile relay team.
There are so many foreigners,
and the fact that there are two
Moscow Olympic medal
.winners_——the United States hav-.
ing not competed-—is a good
indication of the caliber of for-
eign athletes competing.

“If our runners run their types
of races, then they should be-
right there at the ﬁnish line."

When talking with the com‘-
peti_to_rs,_ there is a great deal of
optimism, but at the same time, '

. -‘the realization that it will take"  \
_Itheir_best;effort. -  

 

  

Runnerssprint T0 Nationals

“At the Nationals you don't
have to be concerned with
anyone’ else; everyone has the
capabilities to win,” said Colas.

'“I hope I can take control of my

race from the beginning. I’m
going all out in the trials; I'm'not
saving anything. I have to make
it to the ﬁnals, and then we’ll see
what happens.”

“We're going out to win,” said
Geary. “We have to run our race.
We want them to be chasing us.
It's too tough‘to come from
behind with this type ofcompeti-S
tion, so it’s very important that
we get ahead.” .

“You have to run till you
drop," said Brown. “We can't get
nervous. Whatever happens, ‘
happens. This is the NCAA;
we’ve worked all year for this
meet, and I still think we're as
good as anybody."

Moorhead is the newcomer to
the two-mile relay team. He "
hasn’t run the event yet this year,
but his efforts in the distance
medley relay this year give him
quite a bit of credibility. At the
Big_ East meet, he anchored the
medley team with a mile time of
4:05.7._ He has been consistent‘
since returning to action in Janu-
ary, after he missed. the team’s‘
two meets in December-with bur-_
sitis in his hip.“ " ‘ A. , -_ 3

“ We have to work at the public rela- '

tions image of" our. athletic

V department."
Athletic Directo'r"‘EilW”a'rd Bozik-

June 24, I982

The day Pitt Chancellor Wesley
Posvar announced that Dr. Edward

Bozik would replace Casimir Mys-

linski as athletic director at the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh," some new

priorities were set. ,.
One of these priorities, as stated

V" —_ by Bozik, was to better relations
between the Pittsburgh community
and the Pitt athletic department.

While other areas of Bozik’s poli-
cies have come under attack, it
would be difficult to ﬁnd fault with
the athletic department on this

’ point. Public relations has not just

received lip-service, but real atten-
tion and action from the department

_ and even Dr. Bozik himself.

_'A good example of how Pitt
athletics _lS trying to polish their
image can be seen at Fitzgerald Field

\

House on some evenings. At this
time on the field house track, one
might see better than a dozen kids
from the age of 8 to 18 practicing
under «the supervision of adults.
Some of these are members of Pitts-
burgh‘s New Image Track Club, a
club that represents the city of Pitts-
burgh in race all over the United
States.

The athletic department, "by
allowing these‘ kids to train in the
field house, is doing a commendable
public service. If Pitt does not allow
the use of the facility to the kids, they
have no where else totrain in the
winter monthes and may lose a lot of
their enthusiasum about athletics
and at least will lose some of the
physical fitness acquired by their
running. If Pitt refused to let them
train here there would be afew more
kids on the street with nothing to do.

Another event scheduled, the
Lady Panther High School Invita-
tional, is a boost for the Pitt athletic
image. This meet, to be held March
19 at Fitzgerald Field House, is a
showcase for female high school tal-
ent from all across Pennsylvania,
Ohio and West Virginia.

This year, when a snag was hit in

getting approval from the NCAA to
hold the meet at Pitt, Bozik inter-
vened personally on the behalf of the
invitational to get the necessary
results. Without this intervention
the invitational may not have been
held this year.
The invitational is trained for by
schools all winter and by providing
the facility and organization, Pitt is

not only helping the girls increase
their level of competition, but also is
bettering their level of relations with
the area high schools and parents of
the competitors who come to see the

, invitational.

The members of the athletic
department also help Pitt in its quest
for better ties with the public.

One member, Pitt women's track

Fiindingsome Good Points   Int Pitt Athletics

coach Elbert Kennedy, .Ir.', has beg}-

honored for his work in the com-
munity. Kennedy was named one of
the six Outstanding Citizens of

Pittsburgh by the Pittsburgh Post ,

Gazette for I982.
The awards were based on com-
munity service and were picked by

rontmued on page ezghteen

If we all run well, then we should
be in it," he said.

While only a select group of
Panthers will be present at the
meet this weekend, the accom-
plishments of the team are what
stands out the most. Geary
explained:

“Personally, I didn’t achieve.
my individual goals. I wanted to
qualify and eventually win the
800 National championship. But
these goals are secondary to the
team’s success. It has been very
special for me to have been a part

of this team. This program is
going to grow. Coach Vasvary is:
a real coach; he knows what it’s
going to take. I can’t emphasize
enough how great it has been this
year. We accomplished a great
deal.”

A year ago, the same team pro- ,
duced one All-America——
Geary—and this year they stand
a good chance of having six. This
weekend is as important to the
future of the track program as
anything. Six All-Americas
would draw the attention of pos-

sible recruits, and as it appears

now, that is all Vasvary needs. '

in political science and has made the
dean’s list several times.

A law career may be in the very
near future for Lloyd—he has been
accepted to three law schools’early
program. He hopes to apply the
same strategy he used in the gym to
the court room some day.

Lloyd’s talents are found not only
in the gym but also in the water. He
is an accomplished boat racer. Lloyd

[ks won numerous Club High Point

awards and has been ranked as high
as seventh in the nation.

Whether it is toiling on the side
horse, cramming for an exam or rac-
ing for a ﬁnish line, Mike “Teke”
Lloyd has proved that he has the
determination to be a winner.

and a department whose members
care enough about the city to use
their talents and get involved in pub-
lic service programs, the Pitt athletic
department is taking steps toward

new peaks in their relations with the
public, instead of retreating.

The athletic department and Dr.
Bozik should be commended for
carrying out this policy and they
should also remember that public
relations is a never-ending job.
