The Student -Government Board
appointed Wendy Pekich, an Allo-
cations Committee member, to
replace former board member’
James Haug. The board came to the
decision by meeting and discussing
qualiﬁed candidates for the position
and narrowing them down to one. V

- Pekich is a senior majoring in pol-
itical science ' and , psychology. She
has been active with Student
Government since she was a fresh-
man and has been a member of the
Allocations Committee for the past
three years. Pekich must resign from
her position on allocations now that.
she is a member of the board.:Pekich

ity and events chairman for Greek

“I think the board wanted some-
one who has been around student
government and knew what was

going on already,” said Pekich in a

telephone interview.

The student government and the
“High Nine” have also established
the rules for the student assembly.
The “High Nine’? includes the Pan-
hellenic Association, Interfraternity
Council, Nursing Student Organiza-
tion, Engineers Student Cabinet,
Pharmaceutical Association, Inter-
honorary Council, Blaek Action
Society, Resident Student Associa-
tion and Commuter Association.

Boérd member Jeff Mallinger is
the chairman of the student assem-
bly and stated the rules in yester-
day’s meeting. The student assembly
will meet the second week of every
month, excluding December ‘and
April becauseof ﬁnals. The assem-
bly will include all student groups,
and a planning session for the meet-
ings will be h__eld' with _the.“High

month. Each member of the “High

be brought before the Student

only mandatory for the other stu-
dent groups to attend the first meet-
ing of the student assembly.

The sole purpose of the assembly,
according to SGB member Betsy
Fitzpatrick, is “to bring the student
body closer to student government.
We needed some organized body
that would represent all Pitt stu-

dents, and we could do this through ’

the “High Nine.” The_student‘assem-
bly draws the organizations together
to know what everyone is doing.’_’

The ‘formation of the assembly

was added to the SGB bylaws by last ‘

year’s board. This year% board
wanted to see that a student assem-
bly was created. ‘

“This has definitely been a team
effort by the board. The student
assembly is a stronger voice for stu-
dent government to know what stu-
dents want,” said Fitzpatrick.

SGB president 

By Vincent Murphy
The Pitt News

Luke Kluchko is, unofficially,
president to next year’s Student
Government Board, according to
last night’s ballot tally, only slightly
ahead of Bob Kramer, with a total
count of 1, 101 votes. Kramer lead at
the start of the tally but trailed
slightly in yesterday’s votes, ﬁnish-
ing with a total of 1,036. Pamela
Hart finished behind the contenders
with an end count of 610 votes.

Leading the race for the board
candidates was Lisa Douds with
1,551 votes, followed close behind
by Greg Cederlof with 1,497. Other
candidates elected for the board last
night were: Peter Petropoulis, 1311
votes; James Mumma, 1245; Avery
Abrams, 1050; Daniel Taylor, 1023;
Karen Frost, 993; and Michael Ryan
with 854 votes.

The tallying procedure dragged
through most of the evening last
night, coming to an unexpected halt
at about 1 l p.m. when the tense can-

- -didates were asked ‘to wait until the

end countswere verified by the elec-

tion committee. The debate over,

who would take the presidential slot
in the close race between Kramer
and Kluchko was settled when
Kluchko’s victory was announced at
11:30 p.m.

Kluchko seemed surprised by his
victory and ran from an enthusiastic
but tired election crowd to call his

Kluchko elected

parents. “I'm sort of overwhelmed,-” in

said a confused Kluchko, reminding
himself that “the race was going to

be close.”

Ken Stram, the current SGB pres-

ident, said that he knew that the A

work waiting for Kluchko in 1985
would not be easy; “Hell get a lot
out of it," said Stram, adding that
Kluchko would be very qualified for
the position. Stram also stated that
“any of the three candidates would
have done a great job.”

Though the number of student _

participants in the SGB elections
dropped this year despite an
increased enrollment of undergrad-
uates at Pitt, board members seemed
happy with the turnout. To Ken
Strain, this year’s SGB campaign

seemed successful in attracting the_

 
 

as

 
 

interest of the student body. “I’m not .

disappointed," he said.

This year, SGB elections were I

marked by strict procedures such as
marking voters‘ IDs, recording
Social Security numbers, taping
doorwaysduring tally and restrict-
ing candidates to separate waiting
areas during ballet counting. In pre-
vious elections, tampering with the

election procedures has always been .
a prime concern. However, last‘

night’s defeated candidates seemed
satisfied with the results. Said board
candidate Reid Weinbrom after dis-
covering that he was not included in
next year's SGB, “Oh, well. I tried.
I'll be able to sleep tonight.”

and the U.S.S.R., according to Ray
Cline of Georgetown University at a
U.S.'-Soviet debate on Tuesday
night. _

The debate, held at the William

Now that everyone is moved into
their new apartments, it might be a
good time to question just how good
off-campus housing is. There has
been a number of complaints
recently from students who have dis-
covered that their apartments have
not turned out to be what they had
expected. ‘

Mary Lou Sosso, the coordinator
for the Commuter-Resource Center,
agrees that there are certain precau-
tions students should take before
moving into a new apartment.

"The first thing that a student"
should do, ” she said, is to_“go and
look at the prospective building and
ask the residing tenants if they have
ever had any problems with the
apartment or landlord.” The next
step, she added, is to “go to the hous-
ing ‘department and pick up a
tenants’ booklet, whichcovers the
rights of tenants among -other
things.”

Sosso, having. been an apartment
dweller, wrote the booklet which
contains helpful hi_nts on what pro-
spective apartment dwellers should
ask their landlords beforethey move
in. She is also concerned a’bout"stu-
dents‘ signing ‘of more than one
lease, and she reported several cases

in which students have been coerced ‘

into doing so. “Beware of a landlord
trying to trap you into signing a lease
too soon,” she said. “Agood student
is responsible for every leasethat he
or she signs, and it can result in a lot
of legal problems."

“One thing to remember,”
remarked attorney Harvey Daniels,
“is that a contract is only as good as_

Apiartrnent

_ the two people that sign it. If one of

the parties does not deal in good
faith, the contract isn't worth the
paper it is written on.“ in other
words, his important to have some
idea ‘about whom you are dealing
with.

One of the major complaints
made by Pitt students is the problem
of getting * their security deposits
back. Cathy, a previous tenant who
found her apartment through Daran
Management, said, "We went to
court with Daran about eight
months ago and won, but we have
seen nothing of our deposit, not to
mention an itemized list." She said
that her attempts to recover the de-
posit were futile. "Mr. Padawer was
very uncooperative with us and
avoided us as much as possible.”
Cathy has recently filed suit against
the company.

Mr. David Padawer, of Daran
Management said he is “proud" of
his reputation with his students. He
added that “only four tenants have
not received back their deposits
because of damages.” But after

-interviews with seven people who

were tenants of Parlaw_er‘s buil-
ding, The Pitt News found that none
of them had received‘ a deposit re-
fund nor an itemized list stating why
there was no refund. «

According to Jim Conlin, an_

attorney for Hyatt Legal Services,
“A tenant is supposed to, by law,
receive back~his security deposit
except for damages exclusive to nor-
mal wear and tear.”

Insects are another major com-
plaint. lngrid Smith, a resident at
McKee Place, complained, “An
exterminator came to spray our
apartment, and when askedhim
when we could put the food back in
our refrigerator, he replied, “I don’t
know, in a few hours I guess." The
next morning our apartment was

A still dripping with insecticide."

Do students have legal rights as
tenants? "Yes," said Sosso, "but
most students either do not realize
that they have legal recourse or they
do not want to go through the hassle
of filing suit against their landlords."

I-larryette Mullooly, the manager
of Daniels Realty, in whose building
Smith resides, is sympathetic to the
problem. She acknowledges that
the_re is a roach problem and said,

. “We are doing all that wecan possi-

bly do about it; the thing is, you have
to wait for a few weeks after the
extermination in order to get the full
effect."

Donna Ritter, who rented from
R. Nickel Real Estate on Craft
Avenue, also complained of
roaches. “Aside from the roaches,”
she hastened to add, “we were prom-
ised laundry facilities in the build-
ing." Upon moving in, Donna and
her roommate discovered that the
“laundry facilities” were a clump of
washers and dryers that looked old
and didn’t work. Donna and her
roommate consequently broke their
lease and lost a $400 deposit.

Of course, there are always good
landlords in Oakland. The trick,

.said Sosso, is “not to give up.” '

A common view shared by the stu-
dents who are apartment hunting is
that “all the good places are taken.”
“Not so,” said Sosso. “Don't give up
if you have not secured an apart-
ment in Oakland. There are several
other areas that are accessible to the
University of Pittsburgh."

If students do have a problem
with a landlord, they may file ‘suit in
the small claims ‘court next to the
Giant Eagle on Forbes Avenue and
pay a fee anywhere up to $35. Other
available services for students are
Neighborhood Legal Services and

which charges, if you qualify, $15 for
a consultation in which you will be
advised on what actions to take.

Two Wpesof b
the over wor

By Mike Yaple
For The Pitt News

“My whole body hurts,” said Roy
Hoza, a junior at Pitt. “I don’t know
why, it just does. It’s like my body is
completely beat and my mind is in
the gutter with it.”

On the other hand, junior Sandy
Eastley said, “I'll do anything to.
avoid doing homework — cut my
hair, eat or clean my room."

Both of these students may be suf-
fering from academic burnout. On
one hand, Sandy shows a lack of
motivation, while on the other, Roy
seems to, work too hard. “There’s
absolutely no room during the week

‘ for free time,” he said.

“Almost every student will at one
time or another experience some

' form of burnout," said Dr. Warren

Hill, a counselor at Pitt. According
to Hill, one end of the spectrum is

“passivity — signs of procrastination,

lack of concentration and ‘motiva-
tion. The opposite is working too
hard without enough recreation_and,~,.
a feeling of never getting high
enough grades. This aspect of burn-'
out is less common to psychologists
because these people are usually too
independent to admit a problem.
Engineering major Tim Heller has
taken the “night shift” approach to
homework. “I usually sleep in the
afternoons and study at night so I
can get ‘more accomplished," he
said. “Right now, I spend roughly 50
hours a week on homework and '
classes. I‘d like to get it up to 70. I
don’t think I study too much.”

Dr. Charles See”; a psychology
professor at Pitt, pointed out that
the ineffective and unproductive
tendencies of burnout often affect all
aspects of a person’s life other than

-burnout.

" "tr '1'" ' .

just school or the job. “A person
feels overwhelmed with the amount
of work and often uses rationaliza-
tions that make sense to himself not
to do the work.” ~

Other factors such as family or

alcohol problems may contribute to
burnout. Don Cottage, a junior eco-
nomics major, said. “The weekends
were the only time I could get a
break from school. After a while, the
weekends became more important

. than the schoolwork.”

A Hill pointed out the correlation of
little character and immaturity with
He said the student is
“often not developed enough to take
the work seriously, and also shows a
lack of maturity and discipline.”
Since it’s often the student’s first
time away from home, this immatur-
ity comes from dependency on the
parents, with the student feeling that
things should be handed out freely
to him as they were at home.

Another commom problem Hill
found is that students sometimes
misgauge their true talents. Possibly
too much emphasis may be put on
grades, leading to the “all work and
no play syndrome.” Also, the stu-
dent may have chosen the wrong
major or be having a hard time
adjusting from a small town to a
university’s large anonymous
atmosphere.

There can be other causes of aca-
demic burnout at college. See gave
examples of such as the person
simply not being suited for univer-
sity life. “You may be smart and a
good thinker, but you have to have
the skills to organize your study and
study efficiently,” said See. Other
causes may be that the student
doesn’t get any rewards for hard
work or that ‘he isn’t aware of his
limitations in certain fields of study.

..,- -_.~.-_._ -_. _

  urnout: .
kers and the lazy

The stress that can lead to burn-
out comes from different aspects of
life; the three major problems of col-
lege students are academic concerns,
sexuality and interpersonal relation-
ships. And humor has not been
found to be effective in dealing with
this stress.

The student who has a higher risk
of depression, hopelessness or even
suicide is the poor problem solver
who runs into a lot of stress. Proper
cognitive thinkingand reasoning are
essential to making it through col-
lege courses. Students’ looking at
stressful experiences as meaningful
is also important. If the student can
look at a test or term paper as a
meaningful experience and not just
another obstacle in the week, he will
cut down on stress.

Senior Debi Dalesandry ran into
stressful situations when she started
college — “I’d hyperventilate when
things got rough. My doctor told me
it was from nerves due to college.

Also I used to take librium — 5 mg, «

just enough to calm me down with-
out getting me high — before mid-
terms and finals.”

Sophomore Matt Skirpan
‘explained, “The pressure really
closes in as midterms approach.
After that, it eases off, but then when
ﬁnals come along, the whole routine
starts all over again. Sometimes, I
don’t think the professors see the
students‘ point of view here.”

But how does a person come to
terms with overcoming burnout?
Hill emphasized the development of
character and confidence found
through a counselor. He said the stu-
dent “has to come to terms with life
and who you are; and realize your
self-image, ambitions and values.
You do that usually by failing.”

  State of

Waste

Excluding 30 million tons of residual and municipal

waste, 6.2 million tons of hazardous wastes are generated

annually in the state of Pennsylvania. So what can be
done about it? Shall we demand that those waste produc-
ing industries export their hazardous byproducts and
sludge into other states, thereby transferring the problem
and responsibility onto other residents who are likely to
respond in the same way? Shall we challenge the indus-
tries to relocate, taking badly needed jobs and revenues
out of our communities? Shall we insist that the govern-
ment uphold its responsibility to maintain environmental
quality and, simultaneously, preserve the free enterprise
system while we refuse to examine and alter our consum-
er behavior? . _

The answers must obviously be emphatically no, of
course not, and well, maybe not. The facts of the matter
are that the industries cannot stop generating wastes
unless they shut down or instantly discover a miraculous
new technology to change their mode of production into
one which won’t produce waste. People are fed up with
and endangered by the creeping threat of poison. The
amount of waste, complexity of the problem of disposal
and the costs of cleanup procedures simply and conse-
quently grow with time, and finally, people depend on the
industries and their products in a way that perpetuates
the waste problem. Given these facts, how do we choose
to perceive the problem and thereby react to it?

. A decent environment is not solely the responsibility of
government and industry. Industry provides service to
the community through employment and commodities
that are in demand, and government attemptsto provide
employment opportunities for all to ensure the satisfac-
tion of basic needs and rights in a capitalist system. If
consumers did not generate a market for products con-

taining or manufactured with hazardous chemicals, com-_

panies would have no future in producing them. It is the
consumer, the average “get those chemicals out of my
yard” protester,'who demands the production of cad-
mium, benzene, trichloroethylene, chloroﬂuorome-
thanes and carbolic acid simply through the purchase and
consequent disposal of household’ products.

If we care that much about our health and environ-
ment, why not accept the responsibility of creating and
maintaining a wasteful, chemical-laden society? We can
help the cleanup process by not further adding to it. Let's
start using our consumer power in an environmentally
conscious manner and practice more self-reliance.

 Letters to the Editor

Vote V p
Environment

Though _ I admired the valiant
efforts of your newspaper to con-
front fellow classmates with the facts
in regard to the last four years of the
Reagan administration, I must add
some environmental issues that have
not been fully exposed in your edi-‘A
torials. Since we all have a stake in a

. healthy America by assuring a fresh

supply of drinking water,fclean air,
and minimal contact with hazardous
wastes, we all should know the negli-
gence with which this administra-
tion failed to provide the basic
requirements.

In. I970, the Congress passed the
Clean Air Act, which resulted in a44
percent decrease "in sulfer dioxide
emission, a 30 percent decrease in
carbon monoxide”, and a 16 percent
decrease of soot and ash in our
atmosphere. It is hard to believe one
would ‘tamper with such an effective
legislation, yet Reagan did by sup-
porting a bill that would have
doubled the carbon monoxide and
nitrogen emissions from cars. In.
addition, Reagan mentioned no lim-
itations to control the pervasive phe-
nomenon of . acid rain. . I urge
students to take samples of Pitts-
burgh rain and measure its pH. It
will probably be a pH of around 4.5,
which is equivalent to a gallon of
water with.,4.4 mg ’of hydrochloric
acid added to it. So far, neither the
Clean Air Act nor the Safe Drinking
Water Act nor the Resource Conser-
vation and Recovery Act nor the
Superfund Toxic Wastes Bill has
been reauthorized. ’

Reagan also betrayed our govern-
ment by appointing corrupt and
incompetent officials to head the
Department of the Interior and the
Environmental Protection Agency.
James Watt, once head of the
Department of the Interior, carried
out disastrous plans that included:
refusing to allocate money for new
national parks, shutting down cfﬁ"1-

ces that supervise strip-mining oper- .

ations, planning to sell off-shore
drilling rights ‘in the middle of rich
commercial fishing grounds and
delaying the addition of new species

to the endangered species list.-

Unfortunately, there are more sick-
ening stories as one looks at the
record of the former head of the
EPA: Cleaning up only six hazard-
ous waste sites out ofga total of more
than 500; causing the contamination
of water supplies in Florida, Geor-
gia, California and Hawaii-. with
ethylene dibromide, a powerful car-
, cinogen’; bygignoring documents that
testified to its dangers fora period of

 . ".thI_7ee y_ear.s';and losing_;_SS3.6 million "A

 .'u.:..- .
n - ‘-.7 2 "

of the-money that was supposed to
go towards cleaning up toxic W8.SlCS
(that is one-third of the total budget
for cleaning up toxic‘ wastes that
year). ' - _
It is not suprising that the same
administration that wanted to give

tax-exempt status to racially segre- _

gated schools was willing to sacrifice
our long-term health for a short-
term gain on the balance sheets. I am
not willing to sacrifice my life and
wait to see this man, Reagan,‘ turn
our water into organic soup.

I would like to hear it along with
everybody else’s requests which sur-
prisingly enough seem to be a small

on the hour. Could a solution to this
monotony please be found?

I personally feel the DJ ’s are being
cheated by this “request radio” for-
mat. They recently have been sound-

they are nervous. Radio should be

Speaking as one who attended
Donna Zaccaro’s presentation here
on Tuesday, I would like to fill in
some of the details of her talk that
your coverage omitted. .

-' The Pitt News reported that Ms.
Zaccaro answered the charge that
Geraldine Ferraro’s 100 percent pro-
choice voting record made her an

A activist for “abortion on demand”
‘by saying that her mother was truly

“personally opposed” ‘to abortion
but felt that the separation of church
and state prevented her from voting

_ that way. . .

The Pitt News neglected, how-
ever, to even mention the much
longer discussion that followed
regarding the nonreligious objec-
tions -to abortion.

.The second questioner argued

that the science of embryology '
. showed that the life of any human

individual did indeed begin at con-
ception. When Ms. Zaccaro coun-
tered that “theologians disagreed”
on this p‘oint,,he repeated that “biol-
ogists agreed.” To” this, she
responded, “Who cares?” and said
that some things “are not given to
scientific interpretation." ‘

These statements clearlyimply‘

that Ms. Zaccaro would rather let

government policy be determined by ‘

the lack of consensus among reli-
gious groups over and above the

' consensus of the scientific commun-

ity. This is separation of church and
state? . '

Ms. Zaccaro told one student,
who had questioned why the "Demo-
cratic Party, the party of compas-
sion, supported “abortion on

I demand,” that he could go vote sin-
gle issue for Reagan if he disagreed-

with her.
Whentalking about tolerance at

‘another point, she indicated the

aforementioned students and said
that “some people have only one
idea in their head, as we've seen
here,” and then immediately added,
“but that’s okay.”

She even went so far as to say that
abortion is“not an issue" 'in this
campaign. This could only have
meant that she considers it “not an
issue worthy of discussion,” since it
has certainly created a lot of con-
troversy in recent months and is cer-
tainly determining a number of
votes, one way or another.

It may not be in the best of taste to
quote a parent’s words back to a
grown daughter in public, yet it

’ seems that more than one student on

Tuesday had’ cause to say, “Don’t

patronize me!” to Donna. Zaccaro. .

S From Where I.Stand/ by Kate Piatek

Appreciation for Nature Can’t Wait

Imagine a mixed forest stand in
the fall. The leaves have already
fallen from the lower part of the
trunks and only the tops, shaped like
cones, gently swing with the wind.
The leaves are in tones of melted
gold, screaming orange and bur-
gundy red set against a light gray
ba_rk.’ You kick the thick, cocoa
brown mat under your feet. The air
is saturated with the cool scent of
moist soil, rotting leaves . and
freshness.

If this is something you can only
imagine, I feel sorry for yoti. I expe-
rienced all this and much more last
Saturday on a tour of the Cooper’s
Rock State Forest in West Virginia
with-the Carnegie Institute.

I was on the bus around 8 a.m. still
half asleep,‘ waiting for everyone to
finally get there. As more and more
people boarded the bus, I started
feeling uneasy. Iithought something
was wrong. Not that I mind people
lover 50. Not at all.‘ I’-actually enjoy
their company. I like those thought-
ful eyes surrounded by the delicate
network of ,wrinkles, grayish hair,
sometimes stumbling Vi walk and
warm, wandering smiles. Yet, when
we were ready to pull out, I realized
that what bothered me was the scar-
city of people in my age group.

There were only two people under
22, and three under the age of 30.
The rest were over 50. i

This observation led me.to think

.that the old outcompete the young

on the trails of our state parks. And
then I thought that it just might be
that the young are so immersed in
being urban dwellers that they lose
interest in nature. Might it be also, I
wondered, that some of us don’t
care?

Of course there are bird watchers,
nature lovers, sporadic hikers and
only God knows what else among
students, but I am worried that what

seems to be a general lack of interest
in the outdoors is lack of concern.
Those immersed in city life might
think that seeing dust-covered,
yellowish-brown trees on the slopes
on Mount Washington or in Schen-

ley Park is beautiful. Well, it is‘

pretty, but they ought to go to the

.woods to find out what beautiful‘

really is. Because if they think that
those dust-covered leaves are what
comprises the true fall colors, they
have already lost touch. They_belong
to the polluted world of the future,
gray walls, gray streets, gray trees
(or no trees at all), gray sky, gray
sun‘, gray suits and gray moods.
Because if we don't Care for the
environment and don’t want to visit
it in its purest state, that means we
don’t care about air or water pollu-
tion, we won’t ‘do anything to con-
trol_it.

We can.blame the present admin-
istration for neglecting the environ-
ment. We can blame James Watt
who perfected the steam engine and
brought about the industrial revolu-
tion which is an‘ indirect cause of
pollution. We can go as far in blam-

course, all this is absurd, and we are
young, open-minded, educated peo-
ple, so we shouldn‘t blame anyone
else _but ourselves. Yes, ourselves.

The present administration might
neglect the environment, but we let
them. We don’t express our disap-
pointment when nothing is done to
protect nature-’s shrinking resources.
Who will do it if not us? These nice
older folks that hit the trails on Sun-
days? Even if they express the gen-
eral displeasure, we should be there
to support them. How did we ever
get to be so passive about something
that affects all of us?

Also, we don’t do anything to
make the people who make the deci-
sion, see the needs of the environ-
ment. Honestly, we, the city

. dwellers, don’t know the difference.

I am not asking everyone to jump
on a bus and go on a nature hike
with the Carnegie Institute. lam just
questioning our relationship to
nature, the environment, pollution
 I know we all love those fall colors
but in our everyday dealings with the
traffic on the Parkway, overloaded
computer programs which won‘t
respond to our commands, calculus
tests or boy/girlfriends going out
with our best friends, we lose the
sight of more important things.

But let’s not wait for our hair to
turn white or for our grandchildren
to blame us for acid rain with a pH
of 1, to take a hike through the
woods. Let's never forget there's
more to living than concrete, steel
and air that can choke one to death.
Maybe then, in the solitude of the
fall woods, we will find the strength
to let this administration know how
displeased we are with what they are
not doing to protect our environ-
ment. This can assure us that there
indeed will be woods to walk in 
when our hair is white.

If President Reagan has his way, he’ll appoint a new majority of Supreme Court justices who will outlaw abortion.
Even in cases of rape and incest. But women will still get abortions.
Only, instead of being safe and legal like they are today, they’ll be crude or dangerous and very unsafe.

was at the head of this, and also
accused U.S. strategists of already
planning what we should do with
these weapons after the war is over.
In his rebuttal, Cline argued, “of
course they are planning — that is
their job. If we are well prepared for
a war, we will be in a position where
we can take over the Soviet Union.”
Cline said that the “symbolic use of
thes€[nuclear] weapons have taken
over reality.”

Are_ we safe? “Absolutely not,”
says Barnet, who claims the U.S. is
in a state where more missiles are
aimed at us. “These missiles are
being moved into Eastern Europe,
where control over these missiles is
much less." Cline, on the other hand,
gave credit to the Reagan adminis-
tration for its foreign policy, and
said. “I don't think that there is any

chance that President Reagan has
established that there would be a
nuclear war in the future." In
Barnet’s rebuttal, he stated, “any
nation with thousands of missiles
aimed at us is a problem,” for which
he received a round of applause
from the audience.

Regarding U.S.-Soviet- relations
now, we are standing at the “lowest
point” since the Cuban missile crisis,
according to Dr. Barnet. “The presi-
dent here calls them the evil empire,
and they claim that Reagan is
another Hitler.” ‘

In an attack on Reagan and his
administration, Cline accused Rea-
gan of not taking the situation very
seriously. He said that the U.S.
proposal asked the Soviet Union to
get rid of 70 percent of its land-based
missiles. Unbeknownst to Reagan,
70 percent of their forces have been
on land.

Pitt police force.

By  Kashay
The Pitt News

There is a case of mistaken iden-
tity at the University of Pittsburgh.

Campus police officers are often
demoted to security guard status by
the people they protect. Many of the
faculty and students are unaware of
the powers and functions of the
Campus Police Department.

Officer Karen McKee related that
one evening while on desk duty, “We
got a call from Student Health. They
wanted to know if we were going to
be open after I l p.m. to take a girl to
Western Psych. Are we ‘going to be
open after 11 p.m.?' Thatjust floors
me! People don't know what we’re
really about.”

The Campus Police Department
provides a “24-hour patrol of the
entire campus, 365 days a year,"
according to James Watters, assis-
tant director of administration of
the Public.Safety Department.

The Campus Police Department
was commissioned under Pennsyl-
vania Commonwealth Act I49 in the
early 1970s, according to James
Watters. Act 149 provides that “cer-
tain campus police shall have the
powers and duties now given to
Capitol Police and Commonwealth
Property Police.”

' "1"tie Pitt News, Friday, Noveinberiz, 1984

5th largest in county

Translated into a lay person’s ter-
minology, campus police officers
have the same authority as Pitts-
burgh City Police Department offi-
cers, according to James Watters.

The ﬁfth largest of 125 police
departments in Allegheny County,
the Campus Police Department is a
subdivision of Pitt’s Public Safety
Department.

Of the Public Safety Depart-
ment’s annual $2 million budget,
Watters said, “The university makes
a legitimate investment to provide
security and foster a good school
environment.”

The Campus Police Department
has 75 commissioned personnel, 55
of whom are patrol officers.

The number of patrol officers is
down from N0 in the late 1960s,
according to Officer Leo Lydon.

Commenting on the cut in offi-
cers, Walter V. Waters, assistant
director of field operations, said,
“The climate isn't the same now. We
had 100 officers back in the very
early 70s when we had a lot ofpoliti-
cal unrest on campus, lot of demon-
strations. It was the Viet Nam
protest era.

“And the racial climate seems bet-
ter. We had a lot more racial conflict
back then.

“The officers can’t cover all areas.
I’d like to have more officers, but
we’re not going to get them. It’s a
financial difficulty.”

Pitt’s properties and adjacent

areas are covered by the Campus
Police Department.

For best utilization of manpower,
according to Walter Waters, the
Campus Police Department divides
its bailiwick into 10 officers on foot
and two cruiser beats. I

“Patrol officers have the street
and the buildings within their area.
As an example, Post No. 4——from
Bouquet Street to Bigelow
Boulevard—checks the Law Build-
ing, Forbes Quad, David Lawrence
facilities and Hillman on‘ foot,”
explained Walter Waters. .

The campus is divided in half
along Fifth Avenue to define the two
cruiser patrols. There is also a roving
patrol car out at all times staffed by
the shift commander, according to
Walter Waters. The shift com-
mander monitors both riding and
walking patrol officers and provides
assistance when needed.

To augment the patrol officers,
the Public Safety Department also
has l5 security guards on its staff.
“The security guards are our eyes
and ears," said James Waters.

The authority of campus [police
officers does not end at the Univer-
sity borders. Pitt’s officers have the
power to arrest an individual sus-
pected of a crime related to the uni-
versity anywhere in the Common-
wealth, according to Officer David
Kerchner.

Kerchner gave an example of the
extent of their jurisdiction.

“Robbery happened in W Lot three
times in a row. We followed it up
with our own detectives and we
arrested the actor on the Northside,”
he said.

The Campus Police Department
has its own detective bureau, but,
“We don’t have a situation to main-
tain the expense of a homicide
department,” said James Watters.

The city police are called in “in the
area of wrongful death, about once
or twice a year.

“We’d call them in if a person died
of a heart attack, but it was not
obvious at the time. Also to investi-
gate a suicide to make sure there was
no foul play,” said James Watters.

The Campus Police Department
effects 350 arrests a year. Theft is the
most common crime, and, according
to James Watters, robbery or “theft .
with force" is the most serious crime
campus police regularly deal with.

“Theft happens to people who
leave stuff in common areas, like
Hillman Library. They’ll go into the
stacks and return to find their
belongings gone," said James
Watters.

Besides theft and robbery, the
campus police deal with 15 to 20
aggravated assults a year. “We got
students who battle students, who
battle outsiders, who battle police,”
said James Watters.

Disorderly conduct arrests are
made when an individual is creating
a public annoyance. These arrests

can be for public use of obscene lan-
guage, fighting,creating loud noises
and “behavior which serves no legiti-
mate purpose," said James Watters.

No matter which law a campus
police officer is enforcing, the Public
Safety Department has a specific
policy on the use of weapons by its
officers.

“Our policy is that we'll ﬁnd them
[suspects] another day. Under no
circumstances, other than the pro-
tection of life, do we use deadly force
on a fleeing felon,” said James
Watters.

Besides providing a safe and
orderly campus, Pitt's police officers
have other responsibilities.

One assignment McKee enjoys is
“providing support for Life Flight
and Allegheny One when helicopters
bring in body organs for transplants.
I feel like I'm doing something really
important.

“The flights land on the university
helicopter pad by Trees Hall. A
police car stands by to assist, turn on
lights, keep bystanders out of the
way, etc. It’s exciting to be part of
it." '

The Public Safety Department is
cautious of who is hired to fulfill
these various duties, ranging from
the mundane to the life-threatening.

To be considered for a position
with the Campus Police Depart-
ment, an individual must be 21 years
old, a high school graduate, have a
Pennsylvania operators license, and
no record of having committed a
felony.

Meeting these basic requirements
is not always enough. “We do a com-
plete background investigation.
What they have done in the past is
thebest indiction of what they will
do in the future,” said James
Watters. "

Prior to assuming the duties of the
campus police, each recruit receives
480 hours of police training at the
Allegheny County Police Academy.
They train side-by-side with city and
county recruits.

After completing the academy
course, the newly commissioned
officer is paired for duty with a vet-
eran officer on the force for two or
three months, according to James
Watters. During this period of on-
the-job training, they learn the poli-
cies and routines of the Campus
Police Department.

I by Jeffrey Sewald

Scene: The blustery streets of London. The
late '70s. /1 leather-clad, spike-haired punk
wanders about with a band ofgreasy rogues in

search of something to wile away the even- '

ing.

"What of a pub, mates?”

”Nah.”

’’How about having a look at a band
then?”

”Right. That's hip. Where?”

leaning up against the gritty bricks of a
back alley wall, he spies a discarded local
music rag near a trash bin, apparently blown
there by a.pre-winter gust. He sniffles, turn-
ing his back to the cold draft. His pals assem-
ble around him.

”So what’ll it be then, eh?” he
blurts as he checks the gig listing
toward the front of the paper, his
thumb moving down the page.
”Clash.7”

”Nah, bloody sick of that anarchic
stuff  go on,” retorts a friend as he

‘spits on the ground.‘

’’How about the Stranglers then?”

”Filled to the top of me head with
that ilk,” sneers another.

.”Here’s one for you,” he suggests

.with a combination of exasperation

and curiosity. ”How about the Psy-
chedelic Furs?”

”The what? What kind of band can
they be, calling themselves the Psy—_
chedelic Furs?” '

EIDCICID

”We started out when there were
still the remnants of all those punk-
bandy names,” explains Tim Butler,
bassist and half of the Butler brother
duo in the Psychedelic Furs; ”We
wanted a name that would stand out
from all the other bands. Just a name
to draw attention, and it worked.”

In late 1978, Tim's brother,
Richard, an art student at the time,
was in search of an alternate venue of
expression. He decided on music. The
Psychedelic Furs followed suit.

”I couldn't play anything at the
time,” Tim says through a chuckle.
‘'50 Richard said, ’What do you want to
play?’ I would have liked to have been
able to afford a drum kit .but I
couldn’t,so I wentfor the next best
thing. I wanted to be in the rhythm
section so I went for the bass  and
here I am  in northern Illinois," he
finishes with a laugh.

Holed up in ahotel room in north-
ern Illinois may not be the most excit-
ing thing to happen in Tim Butler's
career but, all things considered, his
complaints are few. After four
albums, the Psychedelic Furs, one of
post-punk’s most challenging bands,

i l have hitabig with their latest, Mirror
I .Moves.

‘ ”From album to album, the songs
get better constructed, sort of honed
down from the first, which was like a
wall of noise and melody. There's
been a definite sharpening up.”

From 1982's ”Love My Way,”
which more or less broke the Furs in
the U.S.,‘to their current chart suc-
cesses, the band feigns no surprise
over its increasing popularity. Mirror

Moves yielded the hit single ”Ghost In"

_You_” and an artistically pleasing,
-however austere, video of "I-Ieaven.”

— V . ’’I think the success had a lot to do

with improving songwriting ability

it andprobably a little to do with our

producers.” .

_ Since their inception, the Furs have
been through almost as many pro-
ducers as therehave been albums to

.1 produce. From ‘the entrepreneurial

_,.Steve Lillywhite, and the technical

pop sensibilities of Keith Forsey, the
band has shown a remarkable ability
to attract top production personnel to
aid its expanding songwriting
capabilities.

”Todd was more concerned with
the trimmings,-the guitar lines and
melodies and stuff, whereas Keith
was more down to getting the bass
and drums‘ perfect before doing any-
thing else. Get down the groove as they
used to put it, and then build on that."

If moving through a number of
producers and holding down a
coveted recording contract with
Columbia Records are any indica-
tions, the Psychedelic Furs are cer-
tainly not a fluke. I ' I

"No, definitely not,” responds
Butler cheerfully. ”We’re notsgoing to
go away.” But what of the future?
More of a move toward ”happy pop?”

”When people_ bring up the word .

’pop,' I always just think of it as short
for ’popular.’ But I prefer the -word
‘optimistic.’ ‘Happy pop songs’ makes
itsound like the Bay City Rollers or
The Knack  God forbid.” ~
Despite the band's move toward
the popular, Tim assures that there
will be no cover version of ’-’ My Shar-

 

Richard Butler

Showcase, Friday, November 2, 1984

A fur by any other name...

ona” any time in the future.

”No, no. Definitely not  I'd quit if
we did.” , .

Catchy tunes tend to reach many
more people than poetic nihilism, and
consequently, The Furs’ audience
began to grow. After a time, one is
unable to remain a local attraction.
What happens to the old fans? The
ones who searched out their favorite
band in the clubs of London with

_ drinks in hand musing over how deep

they were?

”I think a lot of people get a bit
angry or pissed off when, well, they
like to have a band to themselves 
this is our cult band  We're their loyal
following  They don't like seeing their

"band getting out of their grasp to

more people. It's a’ bit selfish in a
way.” ‘ . ‘ "

, It was in those early club days that
the Fursireceived what could be called
their. big break. Being acquaintances
with Britain's punk elite-— in this
case with Siouxsie and the’Banshees
— was a boon‘ for the ambitious
young band. '

”The Banshees used to come down

and see us and a couple of times they ‘I
dragged Steve [Lillywhite] down, and_

Psychedelic Furs — (clockwise from btom rigt)Tim Butler, John. Ashton and

he liked us and approached CBS
about producing us." The ”beautiful
chaos” period: A couple of well
received lps, The Psychedelic Furs and
Talk, Talk, Talk, then a rapid departure
of band members. ' . '
”People weren't progressing musi-
cally along the same lines as John
[Ashton], myself and Richard. We've
always been the main songwriting
threesome. It makes it easier to cut a
song like ”Love My Way” when you
don't have to have two guitars and a
saxaphone blaring in th_ere.”A simple
matter of stripping the act down.
Initially influenced by the electric
phase of Bob Dylan's sporadic career,
Tim Butler maintains that, by the
release of their second album, the
band had definitely shed any obvious

links to their musical lineage. They’

were a band full of angst but offering
no prospective solutions.

”When we first started there was"

an anger of sort of putting every-
thing down, with nothing to put in its
place. Just this is bad, this is bad, this is
bad, without any signs of optimisim"
or anything. I think nowadays we've
got more optimism, musically ‘and
lyrically. I don't like to do much com-
menting on Richard's lyrics, but mus-
ically we sounded angry on the first
two albums because there's so much

‘going on,'so much of the guitars

bashing out; Everybody sounded

_pretty angry in that way.”

Presenting the Psychedelic .Furs
initially as an angry band wasn't
predesigned. The reaction of Oh No!
Not another punk band! was certainly one
they were trying to avoid in their
effort to crack the coveted U.S.
market. The trans-Atlantic migra-
tion, though a tricky one, was suc-
cessful and interesting to muse
upon. American audiences emanate ‘a
special explosive energy.

J ”Yeah. The audiences are great
over here, they really go for it. They
pay their money and they really go
out to enjoy themselves and that's
great. ‘They tend to be a bit cooler and
a bit more posing in England. Can't
move around too much, the hairstyle
might fall.” ' I _

Whatever it was that spurred the
Furs’ pop instincts, Tim denies that

there was any conscious fashioning

for the hungry and enthusiastic
American scene.

”I don’t_think so. I think it sounds -
that way because alot of our favorite .

bands. are , American ‘bands. We've
been playing‘over here for so long
and you hear it on the radio all the
time and itsort of rubs off a bit.” I

Tim Butler is quick to cite Prince
and Talking Heads among his list of
favorites, though he regrets having
not seen either oftheir current films.
And he is fond of U2.

’’I haven't heard their new album yet
either," he remarks with dissatisfac-

‘tion. Employing the enigmatic Brian

Eno as producer, U2 has toned down
their grinding guitar lines in favor of
a more synthetic sound.

”A brave move on their part. They
probably got bored with their sound
after three albums so they wanted to
head off in another direction.”

I Speaking ofsrisk-taking, the Furs’
shift to Keith ”Flashdance” Forsey
wasn't exactly a safety valve. The
danceable track from Mirror Moves,
”I-Ieartbeat," is a direct credit to For-

_ sey’s skill, as was the ensuing 12-inch '
mix of the _‘same tune. But that's as

deep into dance as the Furs have ven-
tured. '

  Having   a lovely

T1

by Michael Selz

American Dreamer is a wonderfully
disposable romantic comedy. It's got a
ridiculous premise, a glamorous
locale, terrific slapstick sequences
and big-name actors. And, its plot
isn't tarnished a bit by -borrowing" so
muchfrom last summer's Romancing
the Stone. _ .

It seems that feminism is old
enough now to wax nostalgic. The
now nearlyﬁextinct species of meek,
mousy little women has been disco-
vered yet -again this year, and like

'9 Romancing the Stone, this one is about a

female author taking on the persona
of her novel's heroine. Instead of
‘ Kathleen Turner and Michael Dou-
- glas in a rain forest, it's ]oBeth Willi-
ams and Tom Conti in Paris.
.Cathy Palmer, middle‘ American
housewife, wins a contest replicating
the style of famous romance-thriller
novelist Margaret McMann. The
prize is a trip to Paris to meet the
novelist and be feted for one week.

 Cathy's husband, less than elated

gig

,9_opposition to the brandishing of tech-'

over the prospect of allowing h-is little

' wifey any glory and even less anxious

_ to leave his job as an accountant for a

week,'refuses to go and encourages

her to do likewise. "I'm not going to

tell you not to go. I'm going to leave

that up to you. I'm sure things will be
a lot clearer in the morning.” '

James Staley is terrifically offen-

' sive in this role. When his wife dumb-

Jobeth Williams and Tom Conti in American Dreamer _

founds ‘him by actually going alone,
he moves his calculator andhis desk
blotter to her side of the bed. He is

not a fun husband. When Cathy

serves a shivering Eiffel Tower of
jello the night of her victory celebra-
tion, he yawns. When they decide to

‘make love, conversation ensues

”Do you want to? ‘If you want to, do
you want to be on top-.7 I don't care,
where would you like to be?"  and
so on. So Cathy leaves this marital
Eden for Paris. '

She gets hit by a car and conked on
the head (classic film device, that)
and, presto, she becomes Rebecca Ryan,
the heroine of her favorite novels.
After escaping the hospital and going

on a shopping spree of which Jackie

Onassis would be ‘proud (Chloe,
Claude Montana, Christian Dior,
Givenchy, etc.) she meets up with the
son of the autho_r she was to meet.
Tom Conti portrays Alan
McMann. Cathy/Rebecca ‘mistakes

him for (Dmitri, the homosexual

sidekick in his’ mother's books.

Believing herself to be on a top secret
mission, she terrorizes Victor Mar-
chand (Giancarlo Giannini), a French
politician, and causes general havoc
in the staid and prim society of Paris’
power elite. Yes, she and Alan fall for
each other, and yes, she unwittingly
uncovers real espionage, and yes, her
insufferable husband comes after
her. ' .

The film succeeds because of two
things. First, it repeatedly spoofs the
genre it represents. Conti jumps into
a cab saying, "Follow that car," and
then mutters, "I can't believe I said’
that." No one can quite (believe
they're in a spy story V _— except
Cathy/Rebecca. _

Second, there are great sight gags.
At a posh diplomat party outside of
Paris, Cathy/Rebecca challenges the
Russian diplomatic corps to a drink-
ing contest and ends up swilling shots
of vodka under a table with the lot of
them, stoned silly. Back in America in
the beginning of the film during the
preparation of the victory dinner, a
loose egg causes 15 seconds of the
most inspired slapstick ever to
remind you of the board game
Mousetrap.

The best camera work is saved for a
scene near .the film's end when the
camera pulls back for an aerial shot of

a cat—and—mouse chase scene on a,

chateau rooftop. -
The acting is competent. That's al
it has to be in this film because the
roles are such fun. American Dreamer
won't make) the annals of film his-
tory, but it will make you laugh —
which is more than I can say for the
ways I've spent some of myevenings.

More Furs A

has hardly affected the Furs’ video

endeavors‘. Their most recent pro-‘

jects have dipped back into black—and-
white imagery, which is drastically in

nicolor that is commonly seen on
MTV. The strategy — another
attempt to go against the grain, to be

A different. The “action — hire reputa- -

ble video artist Tim Pope. .
"He was great. We used him for like
two or three videos. He's really good.
He went withgus. No actual big story
board  like if the lyrics say some
pone's talking on the telephone there’d
be a pictufe of a band member on the
telephone. What he tends to do is set
up a mood for the whole song which;

Q. worked.” -

Whatever the dominant mood of,
the Furs’ material is, it certainly has
captured Pittsburgh. The Furs have

._ appeared no less than three times,

including tonight's performance, in
the past two years, a tribute to the
tenacity of the band's touring
schedule. .

On the road for the last seven

{n months, including dates in Europe.

L andlapan, the Furs will wind up their

at Radio City Music Hall.

ClE|.DClCl~

In the creation of the Furs’ sound,
Tim Butler stresses that all three
Furs are relatively equal, with
Richard providing the lyrics and the

entire trio shaping the music. In the '
end, the Psychedelic Furs’ vision is_

not a short-sighted one. The desired
overall effect ”to

think for themselves.” . v .

Have you ever seen~a movie that

' left you cheering and feeling like you

could overcome any hurdle, even
your domineering lover? Even if he
beat you and your children into
submission? 4 ;

Firstborn opened to Pittsburgh area
audiences last Friday — audiences
who cheered louder than a sold-out
Civic Arena.

It is-the story of Wendy Livingston ‘

, (Teri Garr), a divorced" mother with

two boys, who is torn between her

passion for an unstableman and her ,

‘love and responsibility toward her

adolescent sons. She is forced to
make an agonizing choice. V

It is the story of Wendy's sons, Jake
(Chris Collet) and Brian (Corey
Haim), whose lives are drastically
changed by their mother's new lover,
Sam.

Sam (Peter Weller) is a quick-

_ tempered schemer and dreamer who

is stuck on his own fear of nonac-
complishment. He wants togbelong to

 
  

|

I.  Jake, whois concernediabout his

Christopher Collet, Teri Carr‘ and Peter Weller in I-‘irstlzorn

when he suddenly appears from their
mother's upstairs bedroom. After
this ‘awful first encounter, Firstborn

- takes us through a realistic deteriora-
.tion of Wendy's, Jake's and Brian's

personal and family lives.

Wendy slips from being a responsi-
ble mother to a self-pitying, subser-
vient drug user. Brian becomes the
school bully and comes close to expul-
sion. And Jake, who becomes the
focal point of the movie, becomes an
angry, rebellious youth who must

quickly become an, adult to save his

family from Sam's destructiveness.
Firstborn does a good job of luring

' the audience into experiencing Jake's

transformation through the weak-
nesses of the other characters. The

transformation is smooth and makes

STEELTOWN -
Big Country
Mercury

I'll admit -- I've been enam-
ored of Big Country ever since
last fall when I first heard the
closing measures of ”In a Big
Country” as I flipped from sta-
tion to station on my car radio.
”What is that?” I thought, com-
pletely intrigued. Since then,
I've found that many people
love this band -- and just as
many detest it. This is a group
‘that definitely is not for every-
one, and that's a shame, because
Steeltown, their second full-
lenght lp, firmly establishes Big
Country as one of the four or
five most important bands in
rock.

A great deal of credit should
be given to producer Steve Lilly-
white, who, as proven on .last
winter's uneven Wonderlandvlp
(and whom U2 foolishly passed
over in favor of Brian Eno), is
the one man who can make Big
Country's music, on vinyl at
least, so thunderingly effective
and at times utterly transcend-
ent. Lillywhite sets the tone of
the album right from‘ the first
song, ’’Flame of the West” --
big, tough and loud. ' '

The proof lies in the music.

.Stuart' Adamson, leader and

principal vocalist of the band, is

Salem 66
Homestead

Riveting by means of sophis-
ticated arrangements which are
nearly always intriguing, Salem
66 fail to achieve any stunning
breakthrough on this six—song
debut ep. The band obscures the

meaning behind these lush"

musical settings b bo'

them down in abstract imagery
that is more confusing than
revealing.

Only on the uptempo "Pony '

Song” does the band put
together a cohesive mix of
instrumentation and lyrics. ”I
could love my murderer, but I
could never love yours,” the

‘song begins. Guitars trade off.

a songwriter growing by leaps.
and bounds. His themes, which
on The Crossing, the band's debut,
were interesting if rather half-
baked and unclear, are on Steel-
town fully realized and rank

lyrically with the best in rock.

His profound love for his land
(he was born and raised in Dun-

.fermli'ne', Scotland), for his wife
' and son; and for the beauties of

life are shiningly clear in every
song, along with his disillusion-
ment with industrial society.
Adamson’s contribution,
though, is only part of the
whole; Big Country is very

‘ much a band, as the punishing

and incredibly tight rhythm sec_-
tion of bassist Tony Butler and
drummer Mark Brzezicki will
attest. .

The complexity of the music,
further, stems from the varied
backgrounds of the musicians;
all are veterans of the seminal
London rock scene, but Adam-
son and co-guitarist Bruce Wat-
son share an affinity for Celtic
folk music that lends a distinctly

' Gaelic note to the complicated

musical montage.

That complexity can at times
be somewhat bewildering -
very few of the songs on this
record can be fully appreciated
on the first hearing. But, as with
all great music, the subtlgties
and nuances become more_

muddled’, are at least
interesting.

Too, often, however, Salem
66 sing of broken romance as if
they don't really want the lis-
tener to fully comprehend the
anguish. This denies one of rock
music's greatest attributes: the
ability to capture a mood and or
project it to a wide range of
listeners.

offers proof positive that girl
groups need not be confined by
the sugary sweet-derivative sty-
listics of I...A.’s'Go Go's and the
Bangles, The Salem's musical
texturings are to be admired -—
figuring out what it all means is
another story altogether.

A the long, winding song struc-

ME AND MY FRIENDS
Janey Street
Arista

Janey Street's debut album,
Me and My Friends, aspires to
create an accessible (airplay-
able) and meaningful (serious
statements) work —. touchy
ground for a debut album. It
may have been safer had she
stuck to just one of those con-
cepts. Ho_we.ver, I think even
that would not have saved this
album, for it is a failure on both
grounds.

My first impression when lis-
tening to it was like a bad MTV
(are "there. any other
kinds?) Luckily, I don't rip on

MTV very often. Every‘ song-

had the ubiquitous Sound of
Radio: driving backbeat drum-
ming, distorted yet polite power
chord guitar, meaningless
-washes of colorless synthesiz-
ers, and —that sleek antiseptic
production that we have known

__ so well since the mid-seventies

genesis of Corporate Rock.
Janey has a powerful voice, but
she sounds like my grand-
mother compared to foghorns
like Pat ‘ Benatar and Patt
Smyth. _ _ ‘ _ ‘
But you know, not all Corpor-
ate Rock is so bad. But if this
album does have aspirations to
compete with today's Top 40
wonder bands it hasya long way
to go. Even if you don't dig Boy

George, you would be facetious’

to say that ”Church of the Poi-
soned Mind” isn’t infectious and

$O%C%O%OI IANEY STREET I £O%O%

pleasantly bouncy.

Yes, Me and My Friends is chock
full of nice melodies, guitar and
sax solos and tight ensemble
playing, but there is a secret X
factor necessary for a successful
pop album. She needs a sound, a
gimmick or at least legs like Tina
Turner's.

‘ Unfortunately, this album

not only fails as an accessible
mainstream album, it also fails

-in-its attempt ‘at serious the-

matic and lyrical topics. All of
the songs are ”heav-ee” and
serious; there is no joking
around on this album and it is
sorely missed. Where is Van
Halen when you need -them?
(Which is not very often.)

The lyrics on this album are
trite. cliched, hyperbolic and

 

=o%,oI=:lo%o:o%o:o%o:oI=

basically uninteresting. In
Janey’s rock anthem for the 80s,
”Where' are the Heroes,” she
laments the passing of rock
heroism and acknowledges bit-
terly the unwillingness of the
general ‘music audience to listen
to anything but The Same Old
Thing. Seems kind of ironic to
me that she's taken an active
role in what she so boldly.
criticizes.

Hopefully on her next album’

(if there'is one), Janey and_

friends will‘ lighten. up a bit.
After all, Top 40 music isn't
intended to change the world,
just to keep everybody’s feet

tapping. .

Those of you who've jumped.
on the bandwagons’ of popular
New-Wave acts from England

-should enjoy the arctic, haunt-

ing quality that clouds Aztec
Camera’s latest record, Knife. A
four-man group out of Scot-
land, Aztec Camera plays music
full of banal existential images
and plays it well. ‘ '
On Knife, lead singer Roddy
Frame sounds like the old David
Bowie when he's singing low
notes and‘ Spandau Ballet's
Tony Hadley on the high, notes.

\

Frame’s vocals, and after listen-
ing to him for a while, they
begin to sound monotonic.
-Frame composed (every song
on Knife,- a strangely icy and

poetic venture through visions.

of humdrum romanticism.
‘Lines ' like ”A .gentleman’s a
golden card and a red, red rose”
and ”Don’t wipe your eyes over
liesl Just let them shine their
blue” demonstrate the kind of
lyrical quality that fuels Knife.
But all is not happy on the
home front. On the cut “Head Is
Happy (Heart's Insane),” Frame
admits to being ”deranged,” and
the images represent death
("You know I'm comingI'You
‘feel me coming like a gun from
below”). ‘ ‘
”Still-on Fire”iand ”All I Need
Is Everything” are reggae-
splashed, more upbeat songs
that recall the early Police. ”The
Back Door to Heaven” is repre-
sentative of Frame's best work

both vocally and lyrically. Most _

haunting of all, though, is the
title cut, an incredible song
about self-defeat (”In the same
sea of emotion] Cup my hands
and touch the tide/ And expect
to__ feel the ocean! It's just -a
notion"). ' ’

Though Aztec Camera has a
lot to offer on Knife, it's a slice of
music that's not for everyone.
For those familiar with the band
ABC, this Knifeis the real beauty
stab.

disappointing 7-7 tie Wednesday
when it took on IUP at Belmont.
After winning their ﬁrst two games,
this game was something of a let-

down for the Panthers.

After the first two periods, Pitt
had the lead with two goals in the
first period and five in the second
and was outshooting IUP 45-20. Pitt
hockey coach Jim Owens Sr.
thought that these were the best two
periods his team has skated all year.

the third period. “IUP was sitting
back and running our players while
Pitt would touch the opposition and
get a penalty,” said Coach Owens.
“They didn’t listen to our captains,
they just handed IUP the game."

Goalie John Godwin played a’
good game for Pitt with 47 saves on
54 shots. Outstanding efforts were
also shown by center Jim Lang, who
increased his league-leading total to
14 points with three goals and three
assists and’Jack Murphy, who had
three goals. '

Pitt’s record is now 2-0-1 and they
are preparing for a rematch with
IUP this Sunday at Lakevue. “Our
team is ready for that game,” said
Pitt co-captain Jim Lang. “We are
going to come out skating hard and
make IUP pay the price for Wednes-
day’s game.” ‘ ’

Lang_isn‘t the only Panther who
seeks revenge on IUP, so Sunday's
game should prove to be an exciting

Maybe the onlookers should be
thankful Foge Fazio stood on the
table, instead of picking it up and
bopping each one on the head. In his
first season as head football coach,
Fazio had just watched the Panthers
shut out Syracuse 14-0 in the Carrier
Dome, later ‘standing before the
media like a volcano before a
harnlet. A

Though 6-0 at that point, Pitt's
portrayal of an undefeated squad
nowhere matched the preseason
projections. Said Fazio two years
ago, “Listen, you're crazy if you
think that I’m going to apologize for
a team that’s 6-0. You guys make it
sound like we’re 0-6  I'm tired of
people who try to be negative after a
victory‘. A lot of teams could have
been prime upset victims at Syra-
cuse. Our guys could have cracked.
No one talks about that.”

With Pitt playing in the Carrier

Dome tomorrow afternoon (12:15

p.m., KATZ-TV), the talk is nearly
the same two years later. Athletic
director Ed Bozik gives no pure vote
of confidence nowadays. Rumors
flap in the wind. And despite hearing

g.

“I have a job to do, I'm the man in
charge of a major football program,
I’m expected to do it and I'm going
to do just that,” from Fazio, the dis-
senting sparks ﬂy around his hot
seat. .

Facing the weakest Pitt team in 12
years is a Syracuse cast that must be
measured on a week-by-week basis.
The 4-4 Orangemen opened with a
3-1-mark with road wins over Mary-
land and Northwestern and the stun-
ning upset of Nebraska in the Dome.
But sandwiching the 17-9 Husker
loss were shutouts to Rutgers and
Florida, the second of which led to a
3-4 record as the»Orange dropped
three straight road games. Then last
week coach Dick MacPherson’s

Orange overstepped a 13-0 Army

lead to down the Cadets 27-16.

What’s more, SU’s scored only 93
points in ’84, ranked 105th out of
105 Division I-A schools last week
with 9.4 points per game.

“We've had problems all over the
place in terms of moving the ball
consistently," MacPherson said yes-
terday. “It’s unexplainable. Yet
except for Rutgers, we've been tre-
mendoulsy capable of playing up to
our level. We have to play like hell to
be good. We’re not bad, but we’re
not good in a lot of places.”

When MacPherson isn't the poli-
tician‘s version of a‘ football coach,
he shuffles quarterbacks with Pitt-

settle for a disappointing tie.

The it Hockey‘ team gave up ﬁve goals in the third period to

 

one. “Our team wants that game on
Sunday real bad,” said team de-
fenseman Jim Owens Jr. “We can’t
wait to get on the ice with them
again, and this time we'll be on our
home ice.”

Kmetz completed one of the ﬁrst six
passes he ever attempted in the
second half last week after previous
starters Todd Norley (53.8 percent,
strained knee) and Don McPherson
(no relation. but separated shoulder)
were first-half casualties.

The week-to-week expectations
from the QB slot have varied since
Nebraska pummeled Norley‘s left
knee. Kmetz, though, gets the nod
against the Panthers with Norley

available, though he’s been held out

of contact drills.

Fazio, meantime, hedges between 7

juniors Chris’Jelic and John Con-

unsettledness. “We look at it like we

defenses well and complement one
another,” said Fazio, matching

This weekend’s Pitt Classic is the
last home tournament for the Pitt
women's volleyball team (18-6)‘, and
it seems only ﬁtting that its ﬁnal
home match should pit this injury-
prone squad against the seventh-

ranked team in the country, which -

happens to be Penn State.

Pitt has not defeated PSU in two
years, having lost to the cross-state
rivals earlier this season, three
games to none, and twice last season
3-0, 3-1. .

“Without question Penn State is

our most signiﬁcant match," said,

coach Shelton Collier. “They are
ranked seventh in the nation and are
playing really well. Plus, their four
top players are from western
Pennsylvania.

The spikers' attack may be weak-
ened by injuries to blocking special-
ist Pat Belcher and powerful hitter
Ulana Kohutiak. Belcher is listed as
“doubtful to possible,“ because of a
foot injury. Kohutiak, who has been

fered two weeks ago, hurt a muscle

in her Achilles tendon and is listed as - A

days before her Olympic run. “I
didn’t run, I only walked.” She said
that during the race the next day, she
did not feel physical pain, but was
emotionally distraught.

“The worst part was emotional,
that this would happen the day
before the big day,” she said. “Nor-
mally, the night before a competi-
tion I can’t sleep, I am tense and
nervous, but this time I just col-
lapsed. I did not feel I could run a
good race until one hour into the

speed,” she said.

Waitz said she goes to a physical
therapist three times a week. “It’s
been necessary because I’m not get-
ting younger.”

Waitz began serious running
when she was “I5 or l6,” although
she had been on the track and field
team several years before. She said
that she competed ’in many ﬁeld
events as well as track, but that she
was not very good. She said that it
was more or less an accident that she
started running distances, because
she had run a cross country event
and had done unexpectedly well. I

The Olympian believes that _chil-
dren should be allowed to “have fun
and play aroundawhile, and not be

pushed into marathon running at an
early age.” She said that they should
not get too involved in it until they
are past puberty, so that they
develop normally.

However, she does not consider
herself a role model to younger kids.

“Personally,
myself in that way,” she said, “but
when someone comes to me and says
that ~I»have inspired them it makes
me feel good,” she said. “I like to run
and I enjoy not having to work.”

‘This is Waitz’s first visit to Pitts-
burgh and she said she may run in
the city’s first marathon, to be held
next. spring. “They say it’s flat but
I’ve been here one day and I can see
it’s not. My husband and I went out
running. this morning and we came
to a_ bad area, so we ranaround the
Civic Arena for 30 minutes.”

A‘ typical question that Waitz 

found difficult to answer was her
reason for running marathons. “I
think all runners, ask themselves
‘Why am I doing this?’ It’s very hard
to answer, and I askiit myself very
often. The feeling you have after-
wards — you just can’t explain.

‘ Sometimes it’s very easy to say, ‘It’s
too cold out, I won’t train,’ but you
go ahead and do it anyway.”

Mystical gurus study football Clystal

They say Norma Fazio can cook
up a mean Italian feast with gads of
pasta, just the right spices and ﬂa-
vorings and plenty of good cheer to
go around. Assuredly, she keeps
hubby Foge well fed even though he
finds himself in a kitchen nowadays
that can in no way be compared to
the domestic counterpart.
It’s getting pretty hot and heavy in
Fazio’s kitchen because ingredients
just haven’t mixed, or some have
been absent in this l-6-l debacle of a
football season. For an unprece-
dented third time in one season (in
the last decade) the Panthers enter a
game as the underdogs. It’s a strange
feeling, but one The Pitt News'band
of Gridiron Gurus have taken into
account, as the rest of the nation has,
in our continuing drive to aim for
that elusive goal: batting 1.000 for
just one week.

As usual, though, we don't intend
to reach perfection by predicting the
results of cupcake games. As usual,
an interesting Saturday ensues.

In the land of Dixie this is the first
of three weekends involving
Auburn, Georgia and Florida as
each vie for the Southeastern Con-
ference crown. The Gators have
never won it, and probably won’t

this year if the SEC rules that their.
NCAA-imposed probation disquali-

fies them. A shootout, nonetheless,
happens tomorrow in Gainesville.

Mario Lemieux propelled the
Penguins over the .500 mark for the
first time in nearly two years Wed-
nesday night with a goal and two
assists in the Penguins’ 7-6 win over
the New Jersey Devils. The Pen-"
guins squandered a 7-3 lead and
allowed New Jersey to get back in
the game in the third period; but
they held on for their ﬁfth win of the
season. It was Lemieux’s first goal
since the season opener against
Boston.

/ Chuck Noll said it will_ be Mark
_Malone at quarterback this Sunday
when the Steelers host the Houston

 .. Oilers. Malone was impressive in the

team’s two most recent wins over
San Francisco three weeks ago and
last Sunday over Atlanta_. The Steel-

" ers are two touchdown favorites

over the hapless Oilers.

It’s a big weekend for; Pittsburgh
area high school football teams as
the WPIAL playoffs draw‘ nearer

each week. Steel Valley, who still ”

finds itself in USA Today's Top 20
Poll, tries to keep its perfect record
intact this weekend in a game at

* West Mifflin. One interesting note

about this game is that it is West
Mifflin’s homecoming, which is odd
in that nobody has ever graduated
from West Mifﬂin Area High
School, this being its first year of
existence. Other key games this
weekend include the renewal of the
bitter Clairton—Duquesne rivalry
tomorrow afternoon; cross-street
rivals Keystone Oaks and Seton-
LaSalle do battle Saturday night;
and in a game that will decide the
Allegheny Conference champion-
ship, Freeport visits Jeannette.

From the “It Doesn't Get Any
Easier Department”: Penn State
tries to rebound from last week's dis-
heartening loss at West Virginia
with another Top 20 team, Boston
College. The Eagles, who lost once
this year (to West Virginia) are led
by all-everything Doug Flutie, who
is considering adding “Heisman
Trophy Candidate" to his first
name. Boston College is looking for
its second win over the Nittany
Lions in as many years. Leading the
Lions will be freshman John
Schaeffer, who apparently
impressed Joe Paterno enough in -
last week’s loss to get the nod over

The Pitt News, Friday, November '2," I984

Iowa has to like where it's at,
alone atop the Big Ten with a'5-l
record going into its game against
Wisconsin in Kinnick Stadium.
Hawkeyes quarterback Chuck Long
completed an incredible 22 straight
passes (NCAA record) against Indi-
ana last week — a week that saw the
Badgers upset Ohio State in Madi-
son. Another upset is unlikely.

Michigan’s already lost two
league games and might lose another
against Purdue, which is tied with
the.-Wolverines at second place.

Papa Joe Paterno has his hands

 

full a third straight week when Bos-
ton College’s circus act, featuring
quarterback Doug Flutie, takes to
the air to make up for its loss two
weeks ago against West Virginia.
Meantime, the Nittany Lions suf-
fered their third loss in eight games
against WVU last week.

We could have picked up the
Washington-California game this
week in the Pac-10, but we don’t like
to deal in anticlimactic events.-As
the Huskies sweep in retaining their
No. 1 ranking nationwide, we see a

toss—up in Palo Alto, where Stan-

ford entertains Southern Cal.
Though in first place at 5-1 and 6-0
overall, the Trojans have stalled at
times this season as the Cardinals
won't exactly roll over, possum-
stvle.

For those seeking a good laugh,
cast your eye upon the Atlantic
Coast Conference, where basketball
rules and football is played by fools.
Maryland, on top with a 4-3 record
overall and 3-0 in the conference,
takes on North Carolina.

‘ happen to be the boss of the football
program,” he said. “And I think that
if you’re really a great fan, you’re
loyal to whatever’s happening.
Christ, you could second guess the
hell out of [the head coach]. It's not
like a ‘medical doctor.

“They never have a bad operation.

tion and I didn’t do a very goodjob.’
Now some of them are butchers. But
the best always say they've had a
great operation. Except for the per-
son it happened to. They make a lot
of money and never make any
mistakes.”

What a shame MacPherson never
ran for office.

Given the lowly respect accorded
SU, though, the Orange need this
guy and his enthusiasm. He’s so “in”
to things, they even have him doing
Salvation Army commercials. How
else can on_e account for SU’s rank-

a

ing as having the nation’s top scor-
ing defense just a while ago? Or
holding opposing passers to 146
yards per game? Or the 41,438 fans
who showed last week after SU fell
to 3-4? ..

Start with defensive tackle Tim
Green. The former Parade All-
America and New York state high
school wrestling champ (215) leads
SU with 1 1 sacks and is third with 76
tackles. The leaders, linebackers
Rudy Reed and Bernard King,
check in with 133 and 124,
respectively.

Earlier talk- of moving right tackle
Bill Fralic or Green so they face each
other like last year is likely just that:
talk. “D_oes Noll plan on how many
passes there will be to Lipps or Stall-
worth?” Fazio answered when asked
if he'd switch Fralic to left. “Quite
honestly, we won’t do that,” Mac-

Pherson countered. “If it need be
done, we’ll do that. He’s our Bill
Fralic is what he is. He’s super."
The Dome factor comes in a dis-
tant second. “It's very difficult play-
ing in the Dome,” Fazio admitted.
“Their crowd can cheer very loud.
The voice factor, the lighting. 1don’t
know. You just know you’re in the

Dome. But once you get there the,

ﬁeld is green, the stripes white and
the guys want to play.” '~\

So does MacPherson, though not
expanding on the phrases “we play
football the way it should be
played,” when Pitt and SU meet. He
does admit, “Everybody’s o,n°our
case here, but at least they’re blam-
ing the guy that should get blamed,

you know what I mean? The head .

coach. And they say that oldfart
with the gray hair, he doesn’t know
what he’s doing, he’s losing his

 Will   Orangemen peel Panthers?

stuff.”

And were it not for his"tit1e, you'd
think the man head coached the
Panthers.

GRID BITS: Fazio, assuring all
he’s not playing freshmen to give
them experience, will start left
cornerback Quinton Jones for the
second straight week.

With fullback Darnell Stone pro-
gressing steadily the last three

weeks, he has displaced senior Marc 5

Bailey, who will be employed as a
swingback after doing well at tail-
back last weekend. Stone will still
rotate with Marlon McIntyre.

Injuries will keep linebacker Steve
Apke, offensive linemen Mike
Dorundo and Ed Miller and middle
guard Bob Schilken from action
against Syracuse.

“O12: injuries are,. disappointing

‘and I am concerned for the individu- -

als, but our team needs to continue
working hard to improve, and make
the best possible use of our resour-

look back on the season and channel
our energies to obtaining our team
goals — winning the Pitt Classic and
the Big East championship.”

Pitt’s first opponent is North

Carolina, the defending ACC chani- V

pion, tonight at 9 p.m. N.C.’s top
two players, Jill Berkebile and Linda
Kantz, are from western Pa., and
developed under Collier‘s guidance
in the Pittsburgh junior Olympic
program. Berkebile was also a team-
mate of Pitt’s sophomore middle-
blocker Sue Hoover on the PIAA
state championship team at Rich-
land in 1983. Pitt defeated North
Carolina last season, 15-12, 15-5,

Saturday at noon the spikers com-
pete against Notre Dame, which is
the alma mater of Athletic Director
Ed Bozik. Notre Dame has recently
made a major financial commitment
to women’s volleyball, fully funding
the team in an effort to provide a
nationally-ranked iwomen’s volley-
ball team. “They are in their devel-
oping years now but it shouldn’t be
long before they will be a real force.
We -have worked hard at building a
national reputation with our pro-
gram, and even with our injuries we
hope our tradition of strong play is
the difference,” Collier said. “I know
Dr. Bozik is an alumni, so we’d
really like to win the match for that
reason as well.”

The Saturday ‘night meeting at 7
p.m. with Penn State is the feature
match of the tournament and Pitt’s
last home match. Pitt won the Clas-

“We feel we have developed our
talent and depth to the point where
we are now in a position to win the
MISL championship.” Thosewere
the words .of Pittsburgh Spirit gen-

A eral manager Chris Wright follow-

ing the announcement of the
acquisition of forward Stan
Terlecki. ‘

The Spirit signed Terlecki to a .

three-year contract early Wednes-
day morning. '

The signing comesdjust in time for
the Spirit's regular season opener

     

it

against the defending MISL cham-
pion Baltimore Blast tonight at 8:05
p.m. at the Civic Arena. A large
crowd is expected to be in attend-
ance when the rivals take to the turf.
The Spirit front office is elated over
the response the Pittsburgh area has
given -the Spirit as they enter their
sixth season. Wright noted, “Season
ticket sales are up 300 percent over
last season and early signs indicate a
large crowd for Friday night.” The
signing of Terlecki is also expected

— to generate attendance.

Terlecki returns to the Spirit after
spending two seasons in the NASL.
Despite being the Spirit’s all-time
leading scorer, Terlecki left Pitts-
burgh carrying a “bad boy” image

 I '

Terlecki’s return lifts Spirit  

recognized his reputation, but con-
tends he has changed. Terlecki com-
mented on the possible problem
with his playing style, “You will see a
new Stan Terlecki this season. I have

' a dream to win a championship. I’ve

never won and the only way I am
going to achieve that goal is_to play
together with the team. I'm glad to
be here.”

Perhaps, the happiest person to
see Terlecki back is Spirit coach
John Kowalski. Kowalski suffered
through‘ a season last year that saw
him lose close games due to the lack
of a clutch scorer. He looks at
Terlecki as the missing link.
Kowalski commented, “Last year,
we lacked someone who could put

the ball in the net during unique _

situations. Stan Terlecki can fill that
gap." When asked for his outlook
for the season, Kowalski replied,
“We are going to do it!”

Coach Kenny Cooper of the Blast
brings a veteran team into Pitts-
burgh to challenge the Spirit
tonight. The Blast are led by MISL
MVP Stan Stamenkovic and playoff
MVP Scott Manning. Stamenkovic
was the MISL’s leading scorer last
year and Manning was the second-

. ranked goalkeeper.

A win over the Blast tonight could
prove to be the beginning of big
things to come for the'Spirit this
year. The Spirit went 4-2 in the pre-
season, including two consecutive
