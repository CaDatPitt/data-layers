Pitt has revoked the charter of
Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity lnc. fora
hazing incident in which a pledge
was hospitalized, Director of Stu-
dent Activities Andy Smith
announced March 25.

“When a student is hospitalized
for physical hazing. the university
can not and will not tolerate such
actions." Smith said. “There is no"
question the university hazing policy
had been discussed with Alpha Phi
Alpha as early as a week before the
incident."

The pledge, a Duquesne Univer-
sity student, was sent to Mercy Hos-
pital‘s emergency room March I9,
Smith said. He refused to releasethe
student‘s name or other circumstan-
ces of the incident. ‘

Sources within Pitt’s fraternity
system said the sutdent was severly

 

paddled and suffered back bruises
and kidney damage.

Alpha Phi Alpha lnc., which was
established in l9l3, has a citywide
charter and is permitted to recruit
students from other Pittsburgh uni-
versities. according to Smith.

ln addition.Smith said he learned
of a second Alpha Phi Alpha pledge
hospitalized because of hazing.
Smith said the student “had a physi-
cal complication related to dehydra-
tion." He declined to reveal the
student‘s name.

Kevin Burrell. president ofAlpha
Phi Alpha’s pledge class, also
declined to comment.Alpha Phi
Alpha lnc. originally had seven
pledges. Four pledges were Pitt stu-
dents who eventually quit, accord-
ing to Smith.

Smith said he was informed ofthe
first hazing incident by Duquesne's
Dean of Students Patricia Watt.

Pitt Faculty Honored

By LINDA MILLER

Pitt News Staff Writer . a
Two of the 10 faculty members

recognized for their outstanding
teaching at Wednesday’s Faculty
Appreciation Dinner, commended
students for their concern and
emphasis -on the importance of
teaching. .

Dr. Trevor Melia, who accepted
the acknowledgement as a represen-
tative of the countless faculty,
members who do their job well,
defined a teacher as “a custodian of
learnedgknoiwledge whose obligation

1. -is to carry Vonthat knowledge like an‘.

  

   
  

  

Melia suggested the present slo-
gan among the faculty “publish or

perish” should be replaced with “lec- «

ture or leave" and urged students to
use the slogan. _
‘Dr. Ted ‘Windt praised the stu-
dents on the criteria theyemployed
in selecting faculty members. Windt
said he repays the debt he owes to"
teachers who took a personal inter-
est during a confused period in his
life by “doingthe best ,1 can.” i '
Windt noted that vitality of the
university is_ going to ‘suffer because
of the budget crunch sinceffewer

faculty rnembers will get tenure and

Franternity Charter Revoked Because

Watt said she was unable to com-
ment on the matter. Fraternity advi-
sor Louis McLinden and Smith held
a series of meetings with Alpha Phi
Alpha lnc. officers and advisors.
including a formal hearing on
March 24.

“The facts weren‘t denied by the
fraternity,” Smith said. He
announced March 25 that Alpha Phi
Alpha lnc.’s charter was revoked for
violating Pitt‘s hazing policy, and
that its national chapter could peti-
tion for re-establishment in three
years.

Pitt's hazing policy states that
“hazing is not permitted and has no
place " in the greek system. Activi-
ties that would cause physical or
pyschological harm to anindividual
are prohibited by the policy.

Alpha Phi Alpha lnc. president
Bill Gaskins did not deny the hazing
charges, but added that his frater-

his murder was “his stand for the

itself." ' V

A Added to Mel_ia’s view on teach-
ing, Windt said it is up to the stu-
dents
teaching to the attention of the
university. ' , ‘

Part of Pitt’s Academic Week, the
Faculty Appreciation» Dinner was
sponsored by ' the" lnterhonorary
Council (IHC) and the Academic
Affairs Committee to show both stu-
dent appreciation and encourage-
ment for good teaching.

nity is planning to appeal the
charges.

“The severity ofthe penalty is det-
rimental not only to our organiza-
tion but to the whole university
student population," Gaskin said.
He refused to reveal the circumstan-
ces of the incidents.

McLinden said the incident was
“as serious as could be outside ofa
death." He added that Alpha Phi
Alpha lnc. had been warned about
hazing pracitces shortly before the
accidents occurred. ‘

An anonymous phone caller
informed him hazing was being per-
formed by the fraternity, McLinden
said. He explained that he questi-
oned Gaskinsiabout the rumors and
told him hazing was strictly prohi-
bited. Gadkins neither confirmed
nor denied the rumors, according to
McLinden. g ,

“There have-been 12,000 people

killed in El Salvador and 80 percent ,

have been killed by right-wing ter-
rorists and paramilitary and govern--
ment security" forces,” ‘Sister
Hagerty said. . .
She said. if the United States con-
tinues to.supply_» El Salvador with
,military aid, it “may be interpreted
as a power struggle between the U ni-
ted States and Russia.”

.. Sister Hagerty added,.!‘.T.he_elec- 

tions there, needed to bring about_
change, are a fraud. . r

“Ordin, a spy organization which
means ears‘,-—doesn’t have to prove
their suspicions against anyone. So, .
when the government security forces
come l3okin'g forsthe ones who are.
held in suspicion, niany flee to Hon-
duras,""said Sister Hagerty. '

The para military forces work in
_ot-her—ways. They send death threats

to whoever is causing the disturbaii- .

ces, and shortly after, carry outtheir.
threats.’ ln this .way, they are able to

usepsychological war_fare‘to their »

advantage, Sister Hagerty said. /

and Theta Chi President Bob
Bonesso said the IFC become aware
of hazing by Alpha Phi Alpha lnc.
nearly two weeks ago. Bonesso
explained that a studentgovernment
chairperson reported a committee
member, who was an Alpha Phi
Alpha pledge, that had beenicoming ~ I
to meetings with bruises on his face
and shoulders. He added that he told
McLinden about the reports.

The lFC does not know the names P,
ofthe pledges_involved in the hazing,
Bonesso said.

“The reason we don‘t have the
names is because Alpha Phi Alpha
lnc. never turned in its pledge ros-
tor,“ Bonesso said. “We require that
of all the fraternities." -

McLinden said all fraternities *
‘were also required two years agdto A i

By JONI DENNIS

Pill News Stuff

Chip Roth, a junior Speech
Communications major, was elected
president of the Pennsylvania Stu-
dent Association of State Related
Universities Sunday at Temple
University.

Instrumental in his election to the
position of president were associa-
tion representatives from Pitt; Tony
Ambrosio, Connie Kreischer, and
Cynthia Zingarelli.

Roth is also a chairman of Pitt
Governmental Relations (PGR)

- Committee. which is a member of

the association.

“The association is an organiza-
tion consisting of a group of stu-
dents from Pitt, Penn State,Temple,
and Lincoln University, who are
concerned with lobbying efforts
which will help to aid students,”
Roth said. ,

Roth said his function as presi-
dent of the association overlook
what is happening in the program, to
facilitate the whole process, and to
provide information on how stu-
dents are affected by the strength of
the Commonwealth financial
support.

“The association doesn’t think it’s
fair that the burden of inflation

should be curbed by the students," ,

Roth said in reference to the rising
cost of student.tuition. _

Roth said the association has sev-
eral different tactics of lobbying
which included face toface discus-
sions with the legislators in office,
and press conferences.

“We would also like to hold a rally

conducted by two student groups,
will demonstrate that westudents do

good teaching, and do appreciate
the extra effort some faculty
members make to teach well.”

After an invocation by IHC Vice
President Val Erdman and dinner,
Falo elaborated on both the purpose
and procedure of recognizing
faculty members. i

“By recognizing the l0 faculty
members here today, we hope_to

which will help the students finan-

He said because of the lack of
funding for Pennsylvania higher
education, a person who lives in
Pittsburgh can go to West Virginia
University as an out-of-state student
cheaperthan a student in Pennsylva-
nia can go to Pitt.

“Pennsylvania legislators should
be ashamed of that situation," Roth
said.

The association is trying to make
Pa. state legislators realize that stu-
dents are concerned with this situa-

tion andare doing something about
it.

Roth said as president ofthe asso-
ciation. he is also concerned with the
General Appropriations Bill, the
Pro- Tenant Bill. protecting the
rights of tenants. and the Truth In
Testio_ng Legislation. which will
require the Educational Testing Ser-
vice to send back corrected copies of
their standardized tests.

themselves. The actions of Bishop
’ Romero were a very valuable asset

Vbecause he was known as “the voice

of the voiceless." Romero was able
to see that injustice causedpoverty,
which even some of the other

' bishops failed to see.

“Bishop Romero was involved
with the rich and the poor alike. One
of his main attributes was his ability
to express to the world the suffering
and hope of the people of El Salva-
dor. Since the media was very con-
trolled, Bishop Romero told the
people what actually happened, and
made a judgement either agreeing
with or deploring the actions taken

against the people and he let the peo-
ple decide what to do," Sister Hag-
erty said.

With the Catholic Church’s inter-
vention aand known siding with the
poor, Bishop Romero, Father
Grande, ten other priests and four
Maryknoll nuns were all killed. The
murders were never investigated by
the government.

“The government also has been
unable to control their paramilitary
forces that kill the poor people. How
can the United States government
send military aid to a government
who can’t even‘ control their ‘own
forces? This is a government without

The Future of Health Care Systems

By MIKE LYCZKO

Pill News Slclil Write:

“Government alone cannot create
a great health care system." said
Nathan Stark. senior vice chancellor
for health sciences. “But the private
sector can‘t handle it alone. lt will
take a combined effort ofthe public
and private sector to provide good
health care for all Americans."

Stark discussed “Health Care:
Managing the Private Sector."at the
ninth Thomas Parran Lecture. yes-
terday at Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Health. ‘

After serving from l974to l979 as
vice—chancellor for health sciences at
Pitt and the president ofthe Univer-
sity Health Center, Stark was
appointed undersecretary of the
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare in I979 by President
Carter. He then became the first
undersecretary of Health and
Human Services, before returning to
Pitt in I981. .

Stark said there are two “danger-
ous myths" about the role ofgovern-
ment, especially in health care.

The first myth, he said, is that
problems will be solved when
government is made small——the size
it was before the New Deal.

“The small government concept
displays a peculiar blindness to the
many changes in society over the
past 50 years," Stark said. “We
expect more from our government.”

He commented that the issue
should not be how to make govern-
ment small, but how to make it more
effective.

It is also a myth that business
practices can be widely applied in
government but, Stark stated, good
management is needed.

Business and government don’t
have the same goals, he explained.
“Government must provide services

to all, regardless of whether it is

profitable.”

Looking at health care in Amer-
ica. Stark said “We have much to be
proud of. but westill have much to
do.” He listed such advances as the
eradication ofsmallpox. and the sig-
nificant decline in death rates from
various diseases. ,

Stark outliIIed four areas where
improvement is needed in U.S.
health care:

*Cost: “The cost of this nation’s
health care system is too much,T’ he
said, “and has increased far beyond
the rate of inflation.

*Coverage: Health care is often
not distributed ‘evenly. Stark stated,
especially among the poor and in
rural regions.

He commented that the black
infant mortality rate is twice as high
as it is for whites, and that the aver-
age black man can expect to live
eight years less than his white
counterpart.

*Disease Prevention: A current

issue in health care is whether more

money should be channeled to dis-
ease treatment or to disease preven-
tion. Stark agreed with an increasing
emphasis on education, environ-

mental factors, and other aspects of

preventive medicine.

*Changing Needs: The growing
proportion "of elderly means health
care needs will be different in the
future, Stark said. The most signifi-
cant improvement in longevity will
be for those now in their 503 and
60s——»many will live into their 80s or
905, he said.

“Expanding heglth care systems

i to include all citizens is a difficult-

task.“ Stark said, adding that he
doesn’t believe national health insu-
rance will be enacted in the near
future. '
Stark said that the “health system
will change” in the coming years,
and hopes that “the private sector
and government can renew a spirit

of partnership.“

Reviewing his role in government,
Stark said “management is critically
important“ in handling the huge
budget of HHS. The department
oversees over 300 programs. affect-
ing the nation‘s most vulnerable
people.

He said the federal bureaucracy
fluctuates between the extremes of

an effective business model, and c

immobilization due to “turf wars,"
etc.

One of the limitations facing top
administrators in government is
their limited role in appointing sub-
ordinates. «Stark said. Wih't over 300
programs to administer. there are
inevitable problems in setting pol-
icy, due to disagreements among

, bureaucrats, he added.

Stark praised the Civil Services
Reform Act, passed during the Car-
ter administration. which he said
introduced‘ a merit system where pay
was based on evaluations.

A continuing problem in health
care policy is the tendency of the
political left and right to introduce
laws then abandon the actual imple-
mentation. He stated that Congress
is often vague about the implemen-
tation of the laws it passes.

“There are people in bureaucracy
who feel over-regulated and that
Congress doesn’t understand them,“
Stark said, adding that Congress
should be prepared to take any criti-
cism of its legislation, ins_tead of
passing the blame to the
bureaucracy.

The Parran Lectureship was
established in l963 in honor of Dr.
Thomas Parran, who served as the
first dean of P.itt’s Graduate School
of Public Health from its inception
until he retired in l958. Before serv-
ing at Pitt, Parran was Surgeon
General of the United States for l2
years.

Ioining the Call
to Raise a Voice

The declared war on the°working poor in this coun-
try goes on, but social, and welfare groups in Pitts-
burgh are refusing to accept Reagan’s budget cuts.
without a fight. '

‘*1 Pittsburgh Mobilization Against the Budget Cuts is

part of a nationwide effort to plan demonstrations and

work with groups in other cities in organizing forces to

oppose Reagan’s budget plans. Specificallly, the I
groups has scheduled June 6 as the day for simultane-‘

ous city demonstrations. - '

The most important thing for the groups to recog-
nize is the need for unity and organization. “If we’re
scattered in our resistance...we’ll really lose out,” Carl
Redwood, a force behind forming a Pittsburgh coali-
tion to fight the cuts said. - '

‘V

‘It woul_d be wise for students to become involved in
any local effort to dissuade legislators and others from
accepting Reagan’s budget proposals. In the fall, stu-

, dents will have to deal with reduced student aid and
increasing difficulty in obtaining loans. A college
eduaction_will not be so easy to get anymore. Now is
the best time to become involvedand help organize ., ~
strong resistance to the war on the working poor.

Greek Notes

As! was visiting a friend in Amos
Hall one afternoon, a thought

entered my mind. l realized that very ~

‘few people, other than Greeks, can
list all the sororities on campus. In
addition, even fewer people know
anything about the nature of these
organizations.

So, I thought, “Why not write an
article about Pitt’s sororities, telling
the University community a little
about each one?” What follows is an
informative piece "accomplishing
‘just this—Pitt Sorority Profile Part
I.

Delta Zeta —-Delta Zeta Sorority
is a national sisterhood founded in
1902 and established on the Pitt
campus in l924. Their colors are
pink and green, their ﬂower is the
Kilarney Rose and their chapter
suite is located on the second ﬂoor of
Amos Hall.

One of the 46 DZ‘s (as they are
commonly called) told me that the
word that most characterizes her
chapter is active. “We have a variety
of sisters with many interests and

involved in many campus activities,”
she said.

Kappa Delta—Kappa Delta is a
“southern-based sorority” founded
in I897 in Farmville, Virginia. The
chapter at Pitt was reactivated on
March 1, I979.

A relatively new chapter, the 32
KD’s feel that this gives them a u:
nique quality. _ 

“Kappa- Delta can be anything

that we want it to be. We’re new, the

starters, and ‘it’s' exciting to be part
of creating a sisterhood," said oneof
the sisters.

Kappa Delta’s colors are‘ green
and white, their ﬂower is the white
rose and they are located on the

Delta Phi Epsilon—Delta' Phi

University of Pittsburgh on
December 3, l966.~Their colors are

L urvivors of NCAA Tourney
 Set to Battle for Supremacy

Pep Talk

By Amin Ghossein

 

The smoke has cleared and the
four best “survivors” get ready for a
“Battle Royal” tomorrow a little
after noon. What two weeks ago
began as a long road and a long fight
uphill for 48 teams, has suddenly
become.a reality for the four best
“survivors.” And it seems only fit-
ting that these four teams should be
the ones to grace their sneakers on
the Spectrum ﬂoor.

For throughout this long road,
the pesky little men kept beating on
the bigger boys. DePaul, Louisville,
by U.S. orders, Oregon State, and
Notre Dame. all went down and eve-
rybody was clamoring about the
“Upset Tourney.” A

Well, the road is almost over, and
after the dust has settled, there

stands Al Wood and a superb North.

Carolina team, Virginia with awe-
some Ralph Sampson, and some
guts, Indiana with a Knight and an
Isiah, and LSU with just about the
sweetestteam in the nation.

But the tournament has just
begun. The fun has just begun, for
you and me, because we get to watch
four very special teams go head to
head. The ' matchups are a fan’s

dreams, as Knight's military-type
machine takes on the slammin’, slap-
ping, wild bunch from the Bayou.
From the land ofthe Tar Heel comes
a trio so superb and so well-

_ rehearsed in the art of team play,

that one wonders how they ever get
beat. And then there is the Virginia
Wahoo giant who can dojust about
anything with a little, round orange

ball and a cylinder within his ridicu-I _
Iously close reach and, oh yeah, a A

couple of throwback players who
play with pain and play well.

The Indiana versus LSU‘ matchup
is maybe the more interesting game

since the two teams have not met yet ‘

this year, and their styles are total
opposites..Dale Brown’s juggernaut
LSU team is an amazingly talented
bunch which, at times, reverts back
to the old in-your-face style of play
ofthe playgrounds. LSU is an intim-
idating bunch. Notice the_man they
call Cookie, Greg Cook~—center and

muscle man—talking, taunting, and
generally intimidating Scott Hast-
ings, Arkansas’ center in their quar-
terfmal game. /

Oh, yeah—there were a few
elbows ﬂying, too. Cook is a perfect
compliment to rebounding (espe-
cially offensive) and scoring
machine, Durand Mack1in,_already
named the regional MVP. And

.r

 

along with freshman sensation Leo-
nard Mitchell, the Tigers just may
have enough talent and enough
manpower up front to neutralize
that Tar Heel trio. '

But Indiana and Bobby Knight
might have a little to say about that
first. His Hoosiers may not have the
raw talent of LSU, but they make up
plenty with intelligence, a tough
man-to-man defense, and an Isiah.

Landon Turner, Ray Tolbert and
Randy Whittman, make no mistake,
are very good players, but with Isiah
Thomas penetrating and creating
their shots, they are that much bet-
ter. Witness an incredible 20 assists
by Thomas inhis team’s 87-72 win
over the University '_Of Alabama at I
Birmingham.

But more importantly, this is
Bobby Knight’s team. His Hoosiers
run his man-to-man defense and
always-Iook-for-a-good-shpt-off-an
-Isiah-Thomas-pass-offense with no
mistakes. Whether it’s Whittman,

, hitting a plethora of jumpers or Tol-
‘_bert getting some inside hoops, this

team is pure Knight. They do not
make mistakes, they are well-versed
in the fundamentals of the game,-
and‘ they do not crack when the
game is on the line. Still, getting here

was hard enough and getting by '

LSU‘ may be just impossible.

With LSU’s talent and a little
guard named Ethan Martin who is"
out to prove that there is a guard
beside Isiah, LSU will stealthe show

from Knight’s textbook Hoosiers.

The second matchup is the battle
of the knowns. North Carolina and
Virginia have already met twice, and
both times Virginia overcame big
North Carolina leads to defeat the
Tar Heels. Both games came down
to the wire and there is no reason to
think that this one w‘on’t.

Pittsburgh ‘fans know the Tar
Heels all too well, as they man-
handled the Panthers. With their
enormously talented frontcourt of
A] Wood, Sam Perkins and James
Worthy, and super-sub Matt

VDougherty, the Tar, Heels are a,

pretty imposing team with no appar-
ent weakness. They pass as if they all
had a sixth sense, and as a team, they
shoot well. Actually, Al Wood’s
shooting is enough and underrated

‘Jimmy Black is very efficient ‘at

coordinating the whole showinto a
very powerful basketball team. But,
if they are to beat Virginia, they 7
must contain the besttalent of the
tournament’s final four: Ralph
Sampson. .  .

When the giant is in his groove, in
his game, the Virginia Cavaliers are
.an awesome team to watch- When
Sampson plays well, the entire team
plays well. His effecti_veness_deter-
mines whether Jeff Lamp will get an
open jumper or have to work for his
shot. With Sampson playing well
offensively, the Cavaliersare virtu-
ally -unstopable. He’ll be playing
against_Sam Perkins, who’s talent is
just this side of Dr. J, but the fresh-
man loses close to six _inches in
height to Sampson.

-1

Another. matchup to -watch
closely is the one between Black and
Virginia guard Othell Wilson. Wil-
son did a heck ofajob in shutting off‘
BY_U’s Danny Ainge in_the second
half. If he can do that to Black then,"
folks, we’ll have a Cavalier-Tiger
final; but, the feeling is he won’t. The
Tar Heels, with some superior talent
and better overall teamwork, will
takethis one, even if Virginia’s Lee
Rakerplays-with two broken arms
and a bad back. Let’s "see now,
Macklin versus Wood, Perkins ver-
sus Cook, Mitchell vérsufs Worthy.
Ah yes, the road has just begun.

- The Pitt men's tennis team
opened its spring season last
weekend with two tough losses to
Division I teams Penn State and
Bucknell.

The Panthers were defeated by
the Nittany Lions last Sunday at
State College, as Penn State
swept all nine matches on their
way to the win. ‘

i In the first singles match, Penn
State’s Bill Schellings slipped by
Pitt's No. l player, Rip Wagner,
6-3, 4-6, 6-l. Bill Palardi fol-
lowed with the second win for the
Lions, as he defeated Pitt’s Doug
White in a hardfought match, 6-
4, 6-2.

' “Our first two matches were
very strong. Wagner and White,
our co-captians, played very
good matches,” said ‘Pitt head
coach George Diffenbach.

is Pitt’s power hitter on/the other

high school, 1 played against him

competitive player.”

Panthers would be a stronger,

‘in his predictions.

In the doubles, White and
Wagner continued their strong
play as they defeated Bucknell’s
top two players, Beneke and
Simpson, in straight sets, 6-4 and
Wagner and White won the tie-
breaker 5-3 to take the second set

This year’s edition of the Pitt
team is young and inexpe-
rienced, said Diffenbach.
Wagner and White are the only
two starting seniors on the l4-
man Panther roster. After

‘Wagner and White, who hold

downithe No. I and 2. spots
respectively, the next four start-
ing spots are up for grabs,
according to Pitt assistant coach
Fran Weber. ’

“The three through six slots
have not been determined yet,”
Weber said.i“ln addition to the
four men we’ve been starting,
there are three or four other guys
we haven’t played yet who could
change things.”

, Weber said Pitt has a strong
shot at winning, all of its next
four matches, which fall in a nine
day span. lfPitt can overcome its

team could end with a very

Pantherettes set a team scoring

Penn State, and a high score tonight
would virtually assure them of a

wild-card teams by a formula that

with its regular season average,
which counts as one-third toward its
final cumulative score.

“Of course we’d like to win the
