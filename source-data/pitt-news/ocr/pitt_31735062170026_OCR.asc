 

No flashing bulbs or whirring
television cameras greeted the
participants of the re—opened
free university this time. The
university began quietly as over
50 students and faculty gathered
in the first floor of the Social
Sciences Building Monday eve-
ning.

Dr. David Houston, economics

professor, suggested to the in-’

formal group that it was time for
the Concerned Students and Fac-
ulty (of which he is a member)
to “broaden out” their point of
view and to begin to “break
ground outside of the University
community.”

After Dr. Houston’s remarks,
the meeting broke up into semin-
ars on resistance and nonvio-
lence, curriculum changes, struc-
tural change vs. reform in the
University, modern American
poetry, and the alienated woman.

Sex Series

Holds Last

Two Talks

The final two events of the Sex
and Sexuality Forum Series will
be held tomorrow‘ and Friday.
A lecture and slide presentation
on “Contraception” will be giv-
en at noon tomorrow in the SU
Ballroom. The speaker will be
Dr. Ronald Chez, Associate Pro-
fessor of Obstetrics and Gyne-
cology in the University’s School
of Medicine.

A featured panelist in the Oc-
tober Sexuality Forum’s ‘.‘To Bed
or Not to Bed” and “Human Sex-

ual Response” panel, Dr. Chez‘

has been instrumental in securing
funds from the Department of Ob-
stetrics and Gynecology for this
term’s program of speakers.

In addition to his talk on the
relevant pros and cons of the
various contraceptive methods,
Dr. Chez will lead a discussion
at a coffee hour at 2:30 p.m. in the
SU Supper Room.

“Man/Woman: New Dimen-
sions” will be the topic of a pan-
el discussion at noon on Friday in
the SU Supper Room. The panel,
moderated by Dr. Roberta Salper
of the Hispanic Languages De-
partment, will include: Dr. Ste-
ven Davis, University Philosophy
Dept.; Virginia Joyce, Univer-
sity sophomore; Marvin Mann,
history graduate student at C-
MU; and Sandra Sheeran, Univer-
sity senior.

They will raise such questions
as: Is there a relationship be-
tween masculine-feminine roles
and sexual pleasure? How does
a male view strong assertive fe-
males? Why do women use sex
as a weapon? What do changes in
sex roles do to the man’s self-
image? There will be a coffee
hour at 3 p.m. in the SU Supper
Room for those who want to dis-
cuss these issues further.

The Sexuality Forum Commit-
tee, with the help of several in-
terested faculty, is also working
on securing a three credit, 80’s
and 180’s course on Human Sex-
uality for University undergrad-
uates next year.

 

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Kehl Returns To Research, Teaching

“vg_EoNEsoA_v,‘ MARC!-IJ26, 1969

chneewind Named CAS Dean

Dr. Jerome P. Schneewind,
professor of philosophy at the
University has been named dean-
elect of the College of the Arts
and Sciences, the large under-
graduate school here.

He replaces Dr. James A. Kehl
who has asked to be relieved of
his duties as dean. The College
is one unit of the Faculty of the
Arts and Sciences which encom-
passes both the undergraduate
and graduate programs in the hu-
manities, the natural sciences
and the social sciences.

Making the announcement to-
day was Dr. Charles H. Peake,
provost. Dr. Peake said Dr.
Schneewind would participate
immediately in major deliber-
ations which are now before the
college and will take office for-
mally at the end of the current
term on April 18.

K I.

BAND CONCRT

Dr‘. Kehl said be based his re-

quest to leave on personal rea-

sons and also said he wanted to
return to teaching and research.
He has been dean of the college
since 1965 when it was the School
of Liberal Arts.

Dr. Kehl added that he felt this
was a good time to make the
change because the pressures of
that administrative position are
lightened in the spring term which
traditionally enrolls fewer stu-
dents. “I have considered this
move for a long time for both per.-
sonal and professional reasons,”
he said.

Dr. Schneewind came to the
University more than five years
ago from Yale where he was an
assistant professor. He also had

taught at Princeton, and the Uni- ‘

versity of Chicago. In 1967,
as a Guggenheim Fellow, his proj-

ing Herald Trumpeteers), Veteran's March, and other pieces. The concert
is opento the public and students can obtain two free tickets at the SU
desk by presenting their ID cards. The band will also tour Eastern Penn-

ect was “A History of Moral
Thought in Victorian England.”

Dr. Schneewind, 39, received
his Ph.D. at Princeton Univer-
sity, his B.A. at Cornell and his
M.A. at Princeton.

He has been director of under-
graduate philosophy studies at
the University of Chicago and a
member, Scholar of the House

. Committee at Yale.

On being named dean-elect, Dr.
Schneewind said:

“The appointment to this po-
sition gives me an opportunity
for which I am very grateful to
help in the development of the un-
dergraduate education at Pitt --
something I have been interested
in since I came here over five
years ago. Many of the problems
here, like those at comparable
institutions all over the world,
are deep seated and difficult. A
great deal of discussion and inves-
tigation will continue to be needed
before the students, faculty and
administration can be anywhere

' near sure of how to handle them.

It’s important that effective con-
versations about these problems
be accelerated for there are some
issues on which action is needed
as soon as possible.

“Because of the pressing na-
ture of these problems, I have
agreed to start participating at

once. This is a bit awkward — I‘

still have courses to finish and
administrative responsibilities

to the philosophy department
as well as one or two long—stand-
ing speaking engagements. More-
over, the position of the dean of
the college is now under discus-
sion by the faculty of the arts and
sciences. That faculty, of which
I am a member, is now engaged in
laying down its bylaws, and I
think no one can be very confident
about what they will finally be.
But whatever they eventually con-
tain, I, as a member of the fac-
ulty, will be bound by them. And
if they should contain anything
relevant «to the appointment and
jurisdiction of the dean of the col-

lege, my view of the matter is_

that my appointment to the dean-
ship. as ‘well, of course, as the
jurisdiction the dean would have,

would equally be subject to them. -

“A number of faculty members
have expressed their support of
my appointment, and I am most
appreciative of it. I hope I will be
able to do a job that won’t disap-
point them, and that will result in
making Pitt a better place for
students. They are my first con-
cern.”

 

DR. JAMES KEHI.

Dr. Kehl said his administra-
tive duties also left no time for
research on a project to which he
“feels committed.” Dr.
plans to take a sabbatical to write
a book on Sen. Matthew Stanley
Quay, a powerful political boss in
the late 19th century. Sen. Quay
was from Beaver, Pa. and no bi-
ography of him ever has been
written.

“One of the writers who was
interested in a Quay ‘biography
was Rudyard Kipling,” Dr. Kehl
said. “He came to Beaver to dis-
cuss it with Quay but there is no
record that he ever wrote any-
thing about the man.”

Dr. Kehl is a University alum-
nus and joined the faculty in 1946.
He received his Ph.D. at the Uni-

’ versity of Pennsylvania. For sev-

eral years he was associate dean
in the Division of the Social Sci-
ences. That division was incor-
porated into the Faculty of the
Arts and Sciences during a uni-
versity-wide reorganization in
1967.

For Fall Term

Involvement Course Offered

By PEGGY ALLEN
Staff News Writer

Next fall, the English depart-
ment will offer a new course
which enables a student to learn
through active participation in-
stead of through rote memoriza-
tion. The course, English 160-
163, is entitled “Seminar and
Practicum in Teaching Poetry,”
but, as the originator and instruc-
tor for the course, Dr. Robert
Marshall explained, “The purpose
of the course is not professional,
but academic. It doesn’t turn out
professional teachers; it helps
the student himself learn.”

The idea for the course originat-
ed with the University Committee
on the Racial Crisis (UCRC)
when one of the task-forces, the
University and the Public Schools
was working on a plan through
which undergraduates could re-
ceive ‘credit for working in the

community. Dr. Marshall explain-
ed, “This course will serve as a
model for other courses in the
University. We hope that the
same principal can be adapted
in other fields.”

This course, which consists of
three to 12 credits spread over
one to four terms, during which
the student is free to drop out at
any time, took months of planning.
“We had to consult with the Pitts-
burgh Board of Education, the
School of Education and members
of the Black University Commu-
nity,” explained Dr. Marshall.

“We also hope to have people
from the English Department,
the School of Education, and pub-
lic school teachers drop in on the
seminars. This will be a way to
bridge the gap between these
three groups,” he said.

The course will be a seminar,
meeting once a week for the pur-

   Times Are Changing

by DAVE TIERNAN _
Editor, The Pitt News

After a meeting of the Student Affairs Advisory Committee last Monday, I asked
William Rea, head of the Board of Trustees, how much control the Trustees have over

academic policy at the University.

» Mr. Rea informed me that the faculty and Administration have '90 to 95 per cent
of the “say so” on academic policy. I then asked him if this would remain true if the

Faculty voted to abolish grades, requirements, and in general, adopt a liberal academic .

policy that would receive the state-wide attention of educators, Legislators, students,

"and the news media.

He felt that the Trustees would question the liberal trend, but would only present

outside opinions. He insured me that the final decision would still rest with Faculty and

V Administrators.

This conversation was still fresh in my mind last week when Dr. David Halli-
day, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, resigned to return to teaching. The Uni-
versity named Dr. J. Steele Gow, Jr. as acting dean until a permanent replacement is

found.

.- ' Once again I thought of that conversation with Mr. Rea when the Chancellor
issued a statement on Monday. The statement reviewed action taken during the past
’ year in areas of student involvement in decision-making policy, with academic reform

, as the key area.

When Ireceived notice that Dr. James Kehl, dean of the College of Arts and Sci-

' = ‘ences, was also returning to teaching and that he was being replaced by Dr. Jerome

Schneewiiid (see story on page 1), the words of Mr. Rea echoed in my ears.

Although there is no direct correlation between Mr. Rea’s words and the resigna-
tion of two deans, I had to wonder if there wasn’t more to their desire to return to teach-
ing than was expressed in the University news releases.

Add to these feelings a few rumors that I received from reliable sources, and the

.~ inquisitive mind runs rampant.

The first rumor was one to the effect that the Chancellor’s job was on the line
during the first evening of the Free University’s occupation of the Common Facilities
building. Although this was no news to many students who guessed that it was the case,
the ultimatum to the Chancellor was, “Get those kids out of there, or lose your job.”

One of the two rumors that dealt with Administrators on the ninth floor of the
Cathedral was confirmed. Assistant Dean of the College Dr. _James Watson is leaving in
June to accept a position with another University. -

Dr. Norman Mulgrave, associate dean of the College, has not been contacted yet
to ‘confirm or disaffirm the rumor that he, too, is leaving the University for personal

reasons.

Now, a good reporter answers six‘ basic questions in his stories, but to my mind
the “why” aspect of these current actions has been left unanswered. I can only guess,

' but my optimistic analysis is this:

. Chancellor Posvar and certain members of his staff are honestly concerned with.

the proposals of students and faculty members to reform the present academic policy,

which is 20 years behind the times.

I

These Administrators have taken steps to involve students in decision-making
policies, and have now taken steps to insure the students that they will be working with
receptive Administrators. This is not_to say that the Concerned Students, or any other
group, forced the Chancellor to ask certain Administrators to resign.

It is to say that the Chancellor and certain members of his staff are very recep-
tive to the interests of all students, and possibly certain Administrators saw the writing
on the wall and decided to step down and allow new men the opportunity to work with

the students in updating academic policy.

But then again, these events may be completely unrelated.
Nevertheless, ‘times are changin’ here, and hopefully, for the better.

 One Can Speak For Everyone

, by TOM WALSH
,/ Staff News Writer

As of late this University has heard
much controversy over who does not
represent the majority of the students.
It is this writers’ belief that no one is
capable of representing the majority of
the students, for there is only a ma-
jority in numbers, not in beliefs.

The participants in the recent fast did
not Dretend to represent anyone but them-
selves in their three-day “Free University.”
The pharmacy students, who trekked down
the hill to initiate a counter-demonstra-
tion under the pretense of representing the

' majority of the students really deluded
themselves into believing they were omni-
potent enough to represent all of us. That's

‘ C dumb. If they were representative then

why did they receive less support than the

 

participants in the “Free University?”

A broad conception of the word major-
ity«-permits me to say that there is a ma-
jority present on this campus. This ma-
jority is simply a conglomeration of the
many minorities present on our campus.
Look at the SDS, the BAS, Cummuting
Students, Dormitory students, fraternities,
sororities, ROTC etc., etc., . . . What do

these groups have in common, other than ‘

the fact that they are all associated with

the University? A cross-section of these

various groups would reveal one obvious

From The End Of The Bar

Andy Capp Rei ncarnatedi   ‘T

 By GEORGE LIES
Contributing Editor

If that loveable, happy-go-lucky hero
of the English common hero Andy

“Capp had a counterpart in life, he

would have to be my roommate Zeke.

Unlike Andy, however, Zeke doesn’t
run and hide every time he spots the
reiitman, or the milkman; ‘nor does he
“knock off the blimey Bloke’s head”
when his anger is aroused.

Zeke’s claim to being
the flesh and blood An-
dy Capp is much deep-
er, much closer to real-
ity. But of course, we
all know that truth is
stranger than fiction.  ’

LIKE ANDY. Zeke  9' 

could care‘ less if the    '

world fell to pieces.  

Nothing bothers him. ’ _' ,_
MR«.,LIES-.

Take the time he bought a three-year-old
sports car last September; and had sugar-
plum visions of buzzing around school like
A. J. Foyt in his head. Funny thing hap-
pened though . . . on the second day he
owned the speedy demon, the transmission
splattered to the concrete like a cracked



But Zeke just shrugged his shoulders. It _

was nothing compared to the time his
paddleball teammate cracked him on the
crazy bone with the paddle.

THAT’S WHEN HE awoke one morning
and his thumb was numb, and then later
that same day his little finger was numb.
And two days later, his entire‘ arm was
numb. The doctor said he pinched a nerve,
and the next day Zeke was wearing a cast.

  

‘licking his stamps . .

“It’s only for a few days,” Zeke cried at the
time.

But he had a rough time frying eggs’, get-
ting dressed, and kissing his girl. And when
he was washing himself, it was hilarious.
He was wearing a “can’t get wet cast” and
all he could say was “whata my goin’ to
do?” between splashes.

These uncommonities do not prevail in
Zeke’s life because like Andy he had his
consistencies.

FOR INSTANCE, when he shops at the
supermarket down the street, he never for-
gets to bring home the bacon, the butter,
and of course .
the yellow ones, not the green ones.

And recently he won 100 extra stamps.

. “That’s two full pages,” he said, clicking

his heels and then later winching while
. “I have two full
books now, and I’m starting on my third.
By the time I get married, I might be able
to get a new car.”

Marriage. Girl. Ah yes, just. like poor
Andy, Zeke has a woman in his life. She’s
a black-haired beauty named Bonnie. And
Bonnie was a cartoon character like Andy’s
wife, her balloon would never be empty.

BUT ANDY always beats that rap, by

dozing-off on the sofa, and yet he doesn’t
have anything on Zeke.

In fact, the only time Zeke ever made it
on time to anything, like his nine o’clock
class, was when he was on atwo day binge

and got lost in the‘Cathedral. He always ,?‘::.-V
' answers the alarm in the morning with “Oh

No! ” and then crashes back into bed.

In reality though, Zeke must be like Andy
and he must be like one of those people
who live day to day to day . . . but then
again Zeke graduates in. . . . er. . . April.

Is that right Zeke?

Opinion

Entering A New Phase

by ROBERT SUPANSIC
Special to The Pitt News

(Editor's Note: Mr. Supansic, a 1968

 University graduate, was a former staff

writer and columnist for The Pitt News.)

It is good to see the University enter- ‘

ing a phase of “sélf—criticism." When I
was an undergraduate, most University ad-
ministrators didn’t seem to know a student
body actually existed. The conflicts that
have arisen over the past few years, while
often dangerous and sometimes downright
ugly. are healthy in the
long run and necessary
for the propagation of
that freedom that al-
ways must form the con-
text of real education.
The political corillﬁxt
of the University is
changing. however. and
I am speaking of the
University of Pittsburgh '
specifically. I don’t think, we can ignore
the significance of the Fleming bill and

_ the State Senate hearings. The forging of

the University into another link in the
great corporate chain has been by and
large accomplished. We are now entering
a new phase—direct political interference
from legislative bodies.

_ THE UNIVERSITY is a political sit-
ting duck—an easy mark. To touch briefly
on a complex fact. the University’s social
isolation has’ brought about its political

' isolation. There is no analogous social
group that corresponds with the University

community.

i didn’t find Chancellor Posvar’s per-
formance last week particularly damning.
(I didn’t find it particularly inspiring. ei-
ther.) He was simply moving in relation to
the basic political fact that the Universi-
ty has no constituency. -

. There is a gross illusion operative be-
hind the attempt to force the Chancellor

to stand up for the University single-hand- _

edly. fighting the rest of the establishment
for the University community. The "illu-
Sl0n.lS that one gets power through the
manipulation of someone who already has
i .

I AM NOT implying a hierarchy of

"political values’ as much as a multiplicity

 

of them. This is where things ‘get a little
complicated: there are at least two issues
of primary, first-ranking importance and
they are not the same thing. One of them
is the pressing need for the internal‘ reform
of the University; the other is the main-
tenance of the political integrity of the
University.

It would be unfortunate. if the Univer-

sity became another Mexico City. There
is reason to believe that our situation is

_ considerably worse than theirs. in fact:

we don’t have a potential revolutionary
mass to ally with. (The on'e up on the Hill

I ain’t talkin’ to us, remember?) gr»,
The only counter to the kind of inter- I

ference that is now developing is to put
pressure on the instigators where they live:
elections. I suggest the formation of a
“committee” for the defense of academic
freedom set up to intervene directly in lo-
cal elections. with whatever money, man-
power, and political “knowledgeability”
is available from the University commu_n-
ity. It should have absolutely no formal
ties with the University. Its only function
would be to materiallysupport candidates
it favors and fight those it opposed. While

I can’t think of anyone worth supporting _

at the moment, politicians like Robert
Fleming. John T. Walsh of McKeesport,
and Albert Pechan of Ford City should be
fought. These men have demonstrated in

the past a penchant for grabbing headlinesfji»
_ quick and cheap through attacks on the

University.

THE LESSON OF a Fleming defeat-

or even a very tough election victory —
would not be lost on his fellow legislators.
(Or perhaps even him.) The lesson is that

I you don’t mess with University turf, that

the University is a special non-voting con-
stituency that just doesn’t lay down and
die. ' I

I need not dwell on the urgency of the
issue. Democracy in America is taking a
beating on all fronts. One of the last un-
tried weapons in the fight is the Universi-
ty. If we wish to maintain even the more
potential of the University as an instru-
ment of social change. its integrity must

be assured. 
The days of the Fleming regime are I

numbered . . . A

University Theatre

I ‘Chalk Circle’ Prod

by JOHN DREYER
Staff Feature Writer

Currently playing at the
Stephen Foster Memorial is the
University of Pittsburgh Theatre's
production of Bertolt Brecht’s
great play, The Caucasian Chalk
Circle. Similar to a well known
story about King Solomon’s wis-
don and judgements, the plot car-
ries many political, philosophical,
and moral undercurrents not
found in the Biblical version.
Brecht, an idealistic socialist,
questions western concepts of
property rights, justice and equal-
ity.

In the first act, the play with-
in a play opens in a Georgian
city around the eleventh century,
where a revolt forces the ruling
Governor’s family to flee. The
Governor’s vain wife, Natella

Abashwili, played by Trudy Scott,
remembers to take along all of
her lovely dresses but, in her ex-
citement, overlooks her newborn

  

son. Grusa, a place kitchen maid,
discovers the baby and takes for
her own. She knows that a reward
will be placed on the infant’s head
as well as hers. But she flees with
the child to the Caucasian moun-
tains and a seemingly inextricable
and desperate state of circum-
stances. She awaits her soldier
boyfriend’s return from the war.
At this point, the first act ends,
relieving the audience with a
well needed intermission.

If one were to judge this pre-
sentation by the first act alone, it
would have to be called a dis-
aster. It lacks cohesiveness and
continuity and is characterized
in some spots by especially poor
acting, mumbled lines, and a ser-
ies of almost “camp” film se-
quences in a naive style which
only distracts from the rest of the

play.

   

 

uction Lacks Continuity

The University Theatre's production of the Causican Cha|k.Circle will

continue March 26 — 28.

In the second act, however,
hope begins to blossom for the
unfortunate heroin,e as well as for

the audience. Joseph Nasiff, a.

teacher of dramatic literature,
appears in the role of Azdak, a
drunken village clerk who be-
comes judge. Adzak saves the day
both for the characters and for
this production of Brecht’s mas-
terpiece. itself.  

As soon as he appears, Azdak
dominates the stage with_a spirit
strong enough either to make up
for, or to rub off. on, the other
actors. Thanks to Brecht’s clever
characterization of Azdak,’ and»
thanks to Nassif’s vitality, the
play finally falls together. _

Nassif’s acting is particularly re-
deeming for ‘the play next to
Marcia Godich’s portrayal of
Grusha. She interprets the deep-
ply devoted and self-sacrifi-
cing maiden in a style some-
where between that of Carol
Channing in Thoroughly Mod-
ern Millie and Billie Burke in

The Wizzard of Oz. That is not»,

to say that Miss Channing or

Miss Burke were bad, but they,

certainly would have been out
of place in this role! Miss God-
ich may have talent, but she has
obviously been miscast for this
play.

In addition to Nassif’s suc-
cess, credit is due to some others.
Tom Markahm and James Hulin

provide the first break in the

first act’s monotony portraying
two “Ironshirts” in a comic and

‘satirical routine about the pleas-

ure of soldierly duties such as
torture and rape. Trudy Scott,

role of Arkady, the narrator, falls
a bit short of what would be ex-

members his performances in
previous University Theatre pro-
ductions.

The play tries to be what Mar-

In short, it can be said that the
play is worth seeing basically be-

production is far from excellent. -

By JERRY GRUEBEL

j When Friday ‘afternoon rolls

Friday marks the first afternoon

“tunity to mold his footballers into
,/a“sort of military machine.

“It’s a combat game,” said De-

_ than last year’s promises of “This

They'll be no promises this

_’ out just what he has. He is look-
 ing for movement and consis-
 tency with movement. He is look-

. didn’t meet DePasqua’s require-

. “I don't plan to be, a police-
‘ .man,"’ said DePasqua when asked
about the possibility of a lack of

~ “But,” said DePasqua, “my

Mitters Lose First To MSU, 13-2  

  by ED CONLEYJ
Bobby Lewis couldn’t wait to get his Panther baseballers

into action in the University of Miami Tournament. George:

Medich, the mitter’s leading hurler, must have wished he
hadn’t been around for the opener at the Michigan Statespartans bom-
bed the Panthers in the righty’s first outing, Monday, 13-2.

Medich, who led the mound
staff in ERA last spring, was
blasted for ten of MSU’s runs in
the six innings that he pitched.
Actually, the 90 degree’ heat
must have been worse for Medich

A than the scoring.

Bill Tress came on‘ in the
seventh to relieve Medich, and he
was hit just as hard. The Spar-
tans got three runs off the left-
handed junior in his two-inning
stint.

The performance was, one of

Medich’s least impressive in his
Panther career, but all the trou-

ble wasn't his fault. The mitters,-

who are supposed to be good field-
ers, committed five errors in
the opener. They found the dirt
infield to their disliking after
practicing back home on Trees
Gym’s wooden floor and the
stadium’s grass.

The left-field fence bothered
the mitters, too. Two three-run

   
  

Junior outfildei-Bobby Kohl is one of he lonereturning starters

homers were blown over that
fence to the advantage of the
Spartans, who boosted their mark
in the tourney to 7-1. V

“I expected a slow start,” Lew-
is said, “We had no work on the

dirt infield, but our records will
improve.”

If the defense canlearn to find
the handle again, the hitting that
the mitters showed in the first
game could be enough to make
them look a bit more respectable
than Monday’s showing.

The baseballers collected nine
hits off the Spartan pitching.
Only one of them went for extra
bases, though. That hit, a dou-
ole by Joe McCain in the fifth
inning, produced the Panther’s
initial tally of the spring. Short"-
stop Ron Howie singled the out‘-
fielder home for the score that
put the mitters behind MSU, 2-1.
That was the closest they could

get. ’

‘MVSU .theJ-mitters,'_inex'perience-,w,as costly when __five_ errors -. Helpefcl, ..-.;

   

 
 
  

The final Panther run was
given to them in the sixth frame.
Catcher Sammy Glass singled to
lead off the inning. Lewis put
Ray Reppart in to run for the
receiver, and Reppart advanced to
third on two infield outs. He
walked home after the Spartan
catcher was charged with a pass
ball. '

Lewis was worried about his
team’s slugging ability before he
headed for Florida. “The ques-
tion mark is scoring,” be men-
tioned. “We’ll just haveto hit.
That’ll be the dra_wback early in
the season.”

But, all the hitting Lewis could
mave dreamed about wouldn’t have
been enough in the opener. As_
things went,. John Fredland,
the only sophomore outfielder on
the squad, had the best day. He
banged out three singles in his
four trips to the plate. Earl Bell-
asario and Glass each contribut-
ed a pair of bast hits.

The whole team will have lots
of opportunities to slash their
share of hits, though. There are
six more games remaining on the
tourney schedule. Today will be
the roughest afternoon in the
tourney. The mitters will test-
the big bats from Michigan again
and then will grapple Miami’s
nine; they’re 6-1 in the tourney.

first end of the twin bill, and

ways, will hurl from the right

ness on the eve of the tourna-
ment prevented the sophomore
from competing at all.

Cindrich,- meanwhile, takes an
undefeated. record at heavy-
weight into the nationals and ac-
cording to Adams, he has a
chance to place in the field. Six
places are awarded at the nation-
als, and those who earn places
are. acknowledged as all-Am-
ericans.

Five of last year’s six place-
winners are returning-at heavy-
weight and. Adams admits that
Ralph will have his hands full.
“Ralph’s in good condition now,”
Adams commented. “He’s been
working hard. But quite a» few of
the boys will be bigger and
stronger than he is.‘But realisti-
cally I do think he has a chance
to place.”

Heading the list of returnees
in the heavyweight competi-
tion is Jesse Lewis from
Oregon State, last year’s runner-
up. Lewis, who is favored to take

 

the title, was .a member of the .

U. S. Olympic team at the Mex-4

ico City olympics last fall, where
he placed sixth in the free-style
event.

According to Cindrich, there
is also an outstanding heavy-
weight from Michigan State who,
twice defeated * last year’s na-
tionalchamp, pinning him once in
adual meet.

Cindrich posted "a 7-0-2 mark

in dual meet competition, with ‘:

the ties coming in his opener with
Navy’s Mark Kane and the dual
finale with Lehigh’s Gary Lein-
berger. He lists his biggest vic-
tory as a 3-2 decision over Mary-

(We took the inside out
to show you how different it is.)

Outside: -it’s softer and silky (not cardboardy).
Inside: it’s so extra absorbent. . .it even protects on
your first day. Your worst day!

In every lab test againstthe old cardboardy kind...
the Playtex tampon was always more absorbent.
Actually 45% more absorbent on the average
than the leading regular tampon.

Because it’s different. Actually adjusts to you.

It ﬂowers out. Fluffs out. Designed to protect every
inside inch of you. So the chance of a mishap

is almost zero!

Try it fast.

Why live in the past?

A shaver that gives
almost twice the shave
per charge  
is worth some study.

Our Rechargeable 45CT (below) gives
you 3 weeks of close shaves on a single charge.
(Which is nearly twice as much as any other
rechargeable.)

And it gives you the choice of using the
cord, ornot. -

It also has a lot of things in common
with our new Tripleheader Speedshaver_® 35T.

Both shavers have 18 rotary blades set
in three new ‘floating’ Microgroove” heads,
that follow the contours of your face. "

And they both shave you as close or
closer than a blade in 2 out of 3 shaves. (As
tested in an independent lab by some very in-
dependent men.)

They also have some extras that make '
shaving a lot easier. A
_ separate pop—up trim-
mer, snap-open clean-
ing, a hand,y on/off
switch, and a 110/220
voltage selector for
travel use.

Whichever you
choose, you can't get
a closer shave.

you can't get any closer
