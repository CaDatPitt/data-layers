ing organization.

According to Ronald[Dammond, one of the aides,
the blue flu day was staged in reaction to a refusal
of Western Psych (WPIC) Executive Director Har-
ry Dorsey to meet with representatives of the group

concerning a salary dispute.

_Dors_ey was unavailable for comment, but Pub-
lic Relations Director Betty Haverluck told the Pitt

News that the blue flu day was a
“minor inconvenience” and that
services and care were in full op-
eration.

Clinical .aide George Ehrlich
stated that the blue flu day was
intended as a “unity demonstra-
tion” and "was not intended to
make things difficult for the pa-
tients.”

Haverluck stated that Dorsey
had met with all individual aides
on all shifts and that an across-
the-board raise had been granted
at the beginning of January.

Ehrlich; however, claimed that
the raise was insufficient and that
Dorsey refused to meet with rep-
resentatives of the Psychiatric
Aide Organization, preferring to
talk on an individual basis.

_ The aides, he said, have no written contract
and no legal recourse in the event they are fired or

treated unjustly.

Ehrlich said the aides wanted to establish a un-
ion, according to the provisions of the state’s pub-
lic employees law, which can act as a collective bar-

d) a unique shopping bargain,

If you chose answer “d” to the
above question you are highly in-
tuitive, because the ‘ aforemen-
tioned cotton tee-shirt, recently
purchased by a young woman in
the soft -goods department of the
University Book Center, was sp

priced because it was an original,‘

made right-before-your-very-eyes,
custom tee-shirt.

The white shirt, which would
have sold unadorned at $2.50, was
decorated with the purchaser’s
name, number, sorority, and but-
terflies, at the price of ten cents
a letter with the butterflies thrown
in for free.

The shirt is only one of appro-
ximately 400
orated-shirts that have been made
and sold at the bookstore since it
installed a heat transfer machine
three weeks ago.

Installation of the machine. a
press-type device which transfers
letters and decals in seconds. has

"Aides in bargaining disputessssssss

Blue flu strikes   -Western Psych

by MIKE MILLER

A group of clinical aides at Western Psychiatric
institute and Clinic declared last Wednesday a “blue
flu” day in an attempt to demonstrate a, united de-
sire to form a recognized Psychiatric Aide Organ-
ization,intended to function as a collective bargain-'

t, gaining unit.

He also stated that “there have always been
vague promises of raises in pay according to the
amount of work an aide does, but such promises
have never materialized.”

Ehrlich favors a provision granting aides a one

per cent raise for each year of service, stating that

/

at the present time new employees are paid the
same rate as those with several years of experience.

The success of the blue flu day hasyet to be de-
termined, but Ehrlich stated that most of the 60
clinical aides working in Western Psych would co-
operate with the organization.

Several aides were on the job, however. New i

employees" reported.-ly feared jeo-
pardizing their jobs; one
aide feared losing his job and.as a
result, his conscientious objector
draft classification.

Ehrlich stated that future ac-
tion of this type is not likely, since
most aid es feel a sense of re-
sponsibility to their patients.
These sentiments and the fact that
most of the aides enjoy their jobs,
he said,have deterred such action
in the past.

Petitions _ are being circulated
in behalf of the organization and
members are hoping for support
from at least 50 of the 60 clin-
ical aides working in the hospital.

The petitions will be sent to ‘the Labor Rela-
tions Board in an attempt to have the organiza-
tion recognized as a labor union.

Though. the right to strike is implicit in this

“We’re coming on hot all-over’
the country,” said Kevin Poirier‘

of the Balfour Company which dis-

‘ tributes the machines.

Close to.100 machipes have been
installed in such places as Purdue
University, Tennessee Universi-
ty, Bucknell College, Auburn Uni-
versity and V the University of
Texas.

Additional machineslare being .

installed at the rate of five per
week, said another Balfour em-
ployee. .

Poirier said he thinks the shirts‘

are popular because customers
“can do their own thing.” A pur-
chaser can spell out any name or
slogan or choose from nearly 70
pre-ddsigned decals for applica-
tion to his shirt.

Employees of 'Pitt’s bookstore
said it would be hard to say which
decal has been most popular -
probably the fraternity and soror-
ity emblems, they finally agreed.

But none had any difficulty re- ‘

lating his favorite tee-shirt story.

Dan_ Ross, Supplies Department
buyer, said the “weirdest” was a
light blue tee-shirt bearing the slo-
gan, “Art is not for the masses-
Andrew J. Sopko,” purchased in
honor of a Pitt News music critic
by the same name, bought for the
modest price of $7.25.

“It was pretty nifty,” Ross
said. '

Linda. Henger, a sales clerk. re-;

rnains rnysti_fied by the m'an»wh_o

recognition, Dammon said that the employees
would be reluctant to strike, since they consider
the welfare of patients a matter of first priority.

requested the traditional Wheaties
slogan be replaced by “Pickles,

Breakfast of Champions,” while
‘Bill Miller, assistant buyer for
supplies, is puzzled by the slogan"

he recently printed on shirts for a
half-dozen members"
men’s swimming team: ‘.‘Take it
out hard.” ' ‘
Several customers have request-
ed obscenities which the shirt
makers ‘refused to manufacture.

vides a few prepared decals that

State revokes
domicile ruling 

by EVAN PATTAK

Associate Editor

State Attorney General J. Shane Creamer today revoked a Penn-
sylvania rule that assigned married women the same residence status
as that of their husbands for tuition purposes. .

The.rule, section B-2 of the state’s residency policy, held that the
"domicile of a wife is that of her husband.” a

According to the rule, Pennsylvania women residents who married *‘ " ,

out-of-state residents before they enrolled in school were assessed out-

of-state tuition rates.
Pitt and other state schools followed the ruling.

The ruling had been challenged in separate court cases by stu-
dents at Temple University and by two Pitt students, who charged that
the rule discriminated on the basis of sex.

In Philadelphia, the trial has been delayed for 30 days, during which
the state must write a new ruleto replace B-2. If no revised policy is

presented at the end of 30 days, the state’s residency code will remain’ . 

as is.

A spokesman for the Pittsburgh Law Collective, representing Dena

Meyers and Cynthia Jo Samuel,who filed suit here, said that they would
continue to press their suit. \ » .}

Though revocation of Rule B-2 mooted certain charges of the suit, ‘ 

he said, Meyers and Samuel would still ask that the rule be declared un-
constitutional and that damages be awarded all women whose state
residence status has been denied under Rule B-2.. ‘

Larry Hoyle, Deputy Attorney General, said that Creamer decided  

last Friday to “withdraw approval” of Rule B-2 effective today. Hoyle.
said that a _“variety of reasoris” prompted Creamer’s decision but he
would not specify them. A

Hoyle added that he did not know what rule, if any, would be estab-
lished in the place ‘of the revoked section. ’

“We are in the process of redrafting another rule,’T he said.'"'We
should have it within 20 days.” ‘

that period, the expense is justi-
fied. _ .
He contrasted the situation with
other student organizations that
are constantly replacing old
furniture with inexpensive mater-
ials, remarking, “This is one of
the best investments we ever
made.”

Percy further revealed the phil-
osophy behind the luxuriant lay-
out, stressing that the General
Studies student body comes from
an environmentquite different
than that to which the typical
day student is accustomed.

“The majority work. during the
day, and are more accustomed to
working in an office surrounding,”
he explained. ‘

Therefore, to insure maximum
student participation, “we need a
facility that looks very much like
a conventional office,” said
Percy.- V

Though the purchase of an air
conditioner might appear an un-
necessarily exiorbitant expense,

Percy recalled -that the former‘

stuffiness of the room was not

at all conducive to effective oper-
ation.

Prior to the renovation, a hard
core of six or seven took advant-
age of the facility. Now the num-
ber of regular users has risen to
between 50 and 60, according to
Percy.

SG okays Judicial Board changes

, After a grueling three hour session Tuesday -_

the Student Government Board voted unanimous-
ly to accept an altered version of the Legal Aware-
ness Com‘mittee’s proposed modifications of the
composition of the Judicial Board. «

A lengthy debate which hinged on the selec-
tion process of Judicial Board members ended
when SG‘ decided to appoint a Judicial Board
selection committee composed of judicial coor-
dinator Al Bowen, an SG Board member, and ‘one
member proposed by Bob Ging, chairman of the
Legal Awareness Committee.

Legal Awareness, which had a originally sug-
gested students be selected at random for possible
seating on the Judicial Board, withdrew its sugges-
tion after the verbal brawl.

SG Board members complained that the LA
proposal would not insure qualified Judicial
Board members. I

“They don’t have to know anything,” count-
ered.Ging'.' *‘It’s set up the same as a police offi-

',cer trial board. Allowing random pick allows ac-

tive roles in the judiciary . . . a better chance that

students would get a fair hearing.”

Terri Weaver, Board member, suggested a tri-
al use of the Legal Awareness proposal, but fel-
low board member Dave Bluey cautioned that a
trial period might not cut into the backlog of
cases already piled up.

According to the original proposal, an accused
student would randomly select from the student
body, names of lofstudents. These names and the

names of 10 permanent Board members chosen,

by Bowen would be placed in a container from
which the first ‘five names drawn would comprise
the hearing board. ’ -

Board President Tom Bailey volunteered to rep-
resent Student Government on the Judicial Board
selections committee. Robert Stack will serve as
alternate. ' .

Administrator wary of  

HSO independence bid

by ROB OBENREDER I
The Health Service Organization retained the hope of becoming an

independent student organization Tuesday night, despite discourage-
mentfrom the administration.

The organization (HSO) discussed its plans of becoming indepen-
dent with Dr. Alfred Moye, Dean of Student Affairs, who disapproved of
their plans and sought to dissuade them. "

“I can’t support that move,” said Moye, “but I will not/hin-
der it.” ' '

Moye said that he considers the move for. independence a
hasty one, in that it does not give the new Student Government
a chance to work. The HSO, he said. was "prejudging a lot of
people.” ,

Moye_ also said activities such as HSO are vital to the success
of Student G1overnme—nt. _ ~ S

“This is the kind of thing Student Government will‘ have to do
in the future to survive,” he said. O

Marc Hiller, chairman of the ‘HSO, has said thatnthe group
feels it is at the mercy of the SG administration. .

As a subcommittee, Hiller noted, it must depend on SG for
funding and for approval of its chairman. The group, he said. also
fears that hostile or inadequate SG leaders may abolish the com-‘
mittee and undermine its work."

,The HSO also fears that it may lose its Medical Emergency
Loan Fund if it becomes independent. Because monies _for the.loan
fund were appropriated on the assumption that HSO would be an
SG subcommittee, Hiller said that funds may be revoked if the
HSO becomes independent. .

~Moye agreed that this “could be a very big possibility,“ but
added. “the-administration may prove —-me wrong.” He said he‘
“would have to support” retention of the fund.

Moye advised the‘HSO to continue under Student Government
as ‘long as their work is not hindered. He said hemust be convinced
that “under Student Government you can’t be effective.

Moye said he would support HSO’s move,for_ independence
if the present setup doesn’t. work. However, he expressed optimism
in the newly elected SG administration. . -

The HSO has not yet submitted an application for independ-

ent status ot the Committee on Student Organizations. .

“It’s fantastic the way the

“As far as we’re' concerned,’_’

Sadler said.

Will campaign promises prior‘

“As far as I'm concerned, I’m

of informing students of any-

In an effort to keep students  '

Commenting on the delicate’ '
issue of salaries for student offi-

were warranted, I don’t believe‘ 

that they should be paid out of

are paying enough money.”

doesn’t pay? Consider the public
service commercial which re-
assures parents that “this sta-
tion will use violence in such a
manner ‘as to prove to children
that crime. doesn’t pay.” Roughly
translated, this means, “We will
show you a lot of killings, beat-
ings and other fun stuff, but we
promise that it will happen to
some despicable persons, so you
don’t have to feel guilty about
enjoying it.”

For those who get their kicks
out of football games and wrest-
ling matches, there is always the
reassurance that it teaches good
sportsmanship and stimulates
America's youth to stay physical-
ly fit. ‘

Strangely enough, most of the
concern of authorities has center-
ed around the effects of TV vio-
lence on children. Anyone who
has seen the Saturday morning
cartoon shows realizes that this
fear may well be justified, not
only because of the endless mon-
otony of simulated violence, but
because the effects of violent
acts are never portrayed.

In a typical Road Runner car-
toon, the coyote suffers innumer-
able acts of brutality without
any long lasting physical damage

I am writing in complaint about Szabo Foods.

formance of last week. But when finally prepared, it became clear

that the planners had thoughtlessly presented a choice of

 sumption of pork products. Such lack of respect is inexcusable.I

In a single three minutes he may
fall from cliffs, smash into_ co_ur_i_t;
less walls and trees, be burned
alive, crushed by a steam roller
and boiled in oil; yet he con-
tinues to undergo incredible re-
coveries so that he can continue
the chase. Unfortunately, even
with the aid of modern medicine,
human beings are not as durable.
But do the children exposed to
this potentially dangerous drivel
realize that acts of violence of-
ten have severe physical and emo-

_ tional consequences?

iAnd if cartoons can affect
.children’s personalities, might
not the evening melodrama have
the same effect on adults? The
only way we can contend with
this continued exposure to
cruelty is to turn a part of our-
selves off. The real danger may
not be that simulated violence
causes us to duplicate such
acts, but that it produces human

beings who are callous to the

- suffering of others. 
For years psychologists have

made studies to determine how
simulated violence affects both
children and adults.‘ The findings
of these tests were often contra-
dictory, and no general conclu-
sion was reached. Meanwhile,

‘ broadcasters continued to justify

their programming with the
catharisis hypothesis, originally
advanced by Aristotle in his
Poetics. He reasoned that by
viewing acts of violence the

Any cause that the SDS ad-

Maybe Professors Shockley,
Herrnstein and Lee are right,
maybe they are wrong, but cer-
tainly what theyaadvocate is an
open question, to be discussed
and argued freely, without vio-
lence and antagonism. V

The SDS is either extremely
paranoid about different view-

harming other persons.

In 1969 Congress sponsored a
$1 million study of media vio-
lence and its possible effec_ts on
the youth of America. The ris-

~ ing crime rate, the assassina-

tions of national leaders such as
Martin Luther "King, Robert
Kennedy and John Kennedy and
campus and racial rioting had
brought the subject to the minds
of manyconcerned individuals.

Unfortunately, the report that
was issued to the Surgeon Gen-
eral last month was marred by
the powerful influence of the

three commercial networks.
Each network (excluding the
Public Broadcasting System

which was not consulted) was
given a veto to the nominations
of the committee. The fact that
five of the twelve committeemen
were directly related to the tele-
vision industry was hardly ac-

cidental.

Two ‘were incumbent
directors of NBC and CBS and
three were scholars who wereor
had been employed by the net-
works, according to a recent
article‘ in Newsweek by, Joseph
Morgenstern.

Morgenstern“ complains that
much of the data in the five
volume report was misrepre-

, sented in such a way as to favor
the networks’ interests. The five

volumes containing ‘much of the
actual data are being withheld
the ‘public,’ The news
media chose to accept the.pub-

‘lished summary of *the study.

Thus the article in the New York
Times appeared under the mis-
leading headline, “TV Violence
Held Unharmful to Youth.”

Many newspaper articles im-

plied that the study showed, that ‘
‘TV violence only affects small

groups of youngsters who are
predisposed to aggression. But
according to Morgenstern the
overview of one of the five vol-
umes contains the following
quote. “The present entertain-
ment offerings of the television
medium may be ‘contributing in
some measure to the aggressive
behavior of many normal child-
ren. Such an effect has now
been shown in a wide variety
of situations.”

Morgenstern claims the com-
mittee “misrepresented some of
the data, ignored some of it and

-plot are worthwhile.

 
  

report to Surgeon General blatantly biased

buried all of it alive in prose
that was obviously meant to be
unreadable and unread.” Of
course, not all of the researchers
feel their material was misrep-
resented, but the apparent lack
of ethics casts a serious doubt
on the committee’s findings.

So that puts us right back

' where we started. The simple

fact is that violence is econo-
mically profitable; it keeps the
average viewer in front of the
TV between the commercials.
So it will continue to make up
much of the pap of network pro-
gramming. Melodramatic series

which do not contain a healthy P

(or unhealthy) sprinkling of vio-
lence simply don’t succeed.

Witness the rapid demise of
the series “Then Came Bronson”
a few- seasons ago, which could
have been violent in the man-
ner of the film “Easy Rider,”

 

but which chose instead to por-
tray American life the way it is
really lived. The series writers
apparently felt that stories con-
cerning realistic human beings
and the problems they face
would catch the fancy of cultur-
ed viewers. The failure of the
series merely reflected the
shallowness of the viewer’s con-
cern for quality programming.

The real tragedy of the use of

warmed over plots spiked with‘

indiscriminate violence may not
be the effect they have on so-j.
ciety, but rather the fact that

. these programs waste valuable

air time which could be better -
spent ' on experimentation and
the development of quality en-
tertainment. The reasonable
use of violence in entertainment
may be justified, if the quality
of the material is good and the
moral issues presented in the
Unfortu-
nately, this is rarely the case. ‘

Until the audience tires of

"being duped into spending hours

in front of their TV sets with
the mere display of physical ag.
gression, and puts economic

pressure on the commercial net-
works; it is very unlikely that
change will come. And judging
-by the attitude’ of most TV
virfawers, change is a long way

Editor:

Concerning your advertisement
in Wednesday’s Pitt News for con-
traceptives, I confess that I find
it distasteful and objectionable to
my moral-religious code! It goes
against my principles since I do
not believe in any artificial con-
traception—diaphragms, pills.
foams or what have you. Yet,
when in a campus newspaper this
is blatantly presented to inquir-
ing eyes, it’s a caricature of good
standards, the demeaning of vir-
tue, a good way to help premari-
tal sex along.

Heaven knows, literally, that
there is enough secularism and
lack of spirituality in the world
today. But to present such a pro-

' duct as contraceptive foam in the

campus paper, is grossly out of
style with Judeo-Christian mor-
als—at least for me-

Yet, here on Pitt campus you
have a difficult enough time as

it is to find yourself and your L

way to an after life, if you be-
lieve in one. This little‘piec‘e of
artistic propaganda provides side-
winding torpedoes to sink one’s
moralistic ship for good.

People developing into adult-
hood have enough contentions bit-
ing at their heels—classes, social
and interpersonal relations, a
search for identity, unattained
hopes, careers, etc. With the ma-
turation process going on in at
least 99 percent_ of the student
body, fiendish and also alluring

"ads such as this, tend to make a

person have more near occasions
of sin with the availability of con-

  Leiiers to the editor

traceptives.

Certainly the sex drive doesn’t
need to be unleashed in full force;
chastity, virginity, modesty, and
purity still have their place . . . .
I hope.

This is almost as bad as the ab-
ortion referral centers that various
colleges may offer for utilitar-
ian, economical butchery, but con-
traception is providing the wedge
in the door’ to let the passionate
floodgates open wide and fierce.
And if the door to premarital‘
jaunts and general -monkeying
around is facilitated enough, the
probability of abortions may in-

_ crease.

To underscore a point, I’m
against premarital avenues being
opened with such possibility. I
don’t know if you ran the ad only
for married couples, but since
most of the students on campus
are unmarried, I take it that this
use of the media was also indis-
criminately going to hit unmar-
rieds as well. I feel the Pitt
News could undergird its stature
somewhat better, as far as finan-
ces go, by finding other sources
of advertising revenue.

Furthermore, contraceptivesare

double jeopardy since they en-
hance the possibility for promis-

- cuity—which I don’t buy. (I hope

no one’s laughing as he/she reads
for I am serious, dead serious.)
Premarital "sex involves, in my
belief system, the defiling of the
highest and most wonderful ex-
pression of love between a man

‘ and a woman.

It is something very holv, very

exalted, not to bedebased and
used for the fornicator’s delight
in the back seat of a car. From
my perspective, God has reserv-
ed intercourse preeminently and
only for marriage. Therefore, be-
cause it entails the creation of a
new life and the consummation
of love of a man and woman, the
marital bed should not be defiled.

Moreover, since the human body
is, so to speak, the tabernacle or
vessel where in God may host
His presence, premarital sex is an
insult and a spurning of God’s
holiness and love. Premarital sex
is also perverting the holiness it

" was intended for.

Qn another level, premarital
sex, in my’view-point and from
my informational sources, can
leave psychological and emotion-
al hang-ups, scars, especially-on
the girl. Guilt may reside in mar-
riage later, also. Besides, sex is
not love but an expression, for o
of love. . — '

Fromm considers love to involve
respect, concern, knowledge, and
understanding of a person. To
freely toss sex around for pleasure
is a sign of immaturity, -both at-
titudinally, intentionally, and
spiritually. True love comes from
desiringgtrue good for a person
and doing it, or at least trying.

Taking advantage of a person
for sexual thrills is not love but
cheap selfishness; it does not
stem from -God. True considera-
tion for a person would mean
keeping the bed reserved until
after marriage.

thinkest in thy heart, that is what
thou really art.” This means that
actions, words, and thoughts can
be weighed by the intentions of
the heart. And premarital sex does
not bring to mind holiness, vir-
tue, sanctity, or love of God, but
rather lack of concern and of
responsibility, shoddy nobility,
poor intentions.

Basically, it represents every-
thing that marriage was not in-
tended for. Where God is not,
you can’t expect to find the full-
ness, the joy, the satisfaction of
life. And contraceptives open the
door for this destructive path in

this life, and possible damnation

in the next, I believe.-

« Therefore, I wish this ad’ for
sexual leisure would be run in an

  

underground ‘newspaper, not in-
something the stature of a uni-'

versity paper. V \
Finally, I feel chastity is some-

thing to be proud. of, thankful to 1
God for. I say what I have be-,

, cause I feel there are times to
speak out rather than hold one’s
peace.

‘If I may coin a phrase: Per-

haps if more people of the ‘silent’ ' X‘ 

majority“ voiced their opinions

rather than holding back, maybe, I

just maybe God could find a way

to work tremendous good "down:

All might be fair-in love, war and reviewing, except that the

I would like to-correct the boner by Andrew J. Sopke in his

Proust, just as to many other Parisians, music was nothing more than I

apres dinner entertainment for the salon.”

Even a cursory knowledgeof Proust’s work will indicate that

Breaking out of his normal nine
‘man rotation and sticking to a
fresh combination of ballplayers,
Buzz Ridl guided the Panthers to
a 75-68. pasting of the Kent State
Golden Flashes Wednesday night
in the Field House.

Revealing a completely revised

starting line-up, which included.

veterans Mike Paul, Kent Scott,
and Billy Knight, flanked by jun-
iorsBill Sulkowski and‘ Carl Mor-
ris, Ridl proved that a shake-up

was necessary to change the cag- _

ers recent _doldrums. The value of
the changes didn’t surface though
until early in the second half.

The Ohioans managed to stay

with Pitt point for point for most ‘

of thefirst half. They accomplish-.
ed this feat without their high
scoring senior, guard Ruben Vance
who contracted his third foul ear-
ly in the first half and sat down,
with 11 minutes left in that frame.

The Panthers, now 9-9 on the
year,, managed to contain Vance

for most of the contest, but big 6-7
center Dwight Kenner was a bit
more elusive against the Cats’
shifting defense as he canned 12
points in the first half to keep the
Flashes in the game.

“He had three of those baskets
on rebounds,” commented Ridl af-
ter the contest. “They were get-
ting a lot of those inside shots."

Pitt’s-slow start allowed KSU
to take an ‘early lead which it
maintained until Billy Knight went

Paul then chimed in with 14 points

“Things have been going pretty -
well with us and we expect to do a
good job,’,’ commented Banner on
the expected performance of his

tracksters tomorrow.

Pitt’s ‘long jumper’ Billy Rea
will not be competing in the Invi-

tational. According to Banner, the *
‘foam pits in William and Mary’s

Field House ‘are more liable to
cause injury to a jumper than -the
regular sand pits. _

“Bill would have gone but it was

ner. "It is ‘not quite worth taking

in the first half,” indicated Ridl
concerning the fact that Knight
hardly touched the ball for-the
first seven minutes of play. “We
started to -get the ball to him
more. Paul was getting so many
of the shots in there before that.”

Only one other player saw ac-
tion for the Panthers on Wednes-
day night and that was_Ken Wag-
oner. Wagoner came in for Sul-
kowski about midway through the
first half and helped weave the
offense through KSU’s press. The
fact that Ridl stayed with only six
men for the entire game is a dras-
tic change for the veteran coach.

"I like to use seven or eight
players in there,” said Ridl. “This

gone with only six. I would like to
have gotten more guys in there
but they were playing so well that
I left them in.” ‘

The second half proved to be the
deciding period as the Cats jump-
ed on the Flashes early andnever
let up. Kent Scott found the range
as 12 of his 20 pointsfell in the
second frame, _ aided by 14 by
Knight. The Panther defense
tightened and despite some ques-
tionable officiating the Panthers
kept the margin constant.

Vance fouled out with 6:27 left
in the contest but by then the
Flashes’ fate was sealed. Knight

Rebounding from a pair of tough defeats last weekend, the Pitt
Hockey Club overwhelmed St. Francis College, 12-3, at the Alpine Ice
Chalet last Tuesday. Denny Browne and Frank Williams paced the skat-
ers, each nettinga -hat trick. 1 . '

St. Francis proved to be no com-
petition for Pitt after Sunday’s
game with the Pittsburgh Knights.
The skaters completely domin-
ated the play, firing a total of 54
shots on the St. Francis net.

The second period proved to be
the clincher as Pitt ..scored three
unanswered goals. Frank Wil-
liams scored at 1 :27 of the period

- when Billy Glanville won a face-
off in the St. Francis zone and
fired a pass to him. Williams took
the puck and fired it past the help-
-less goalie.

Denny Browne and Bill Glanville
both tallied power play goals later
in the period to make the score 7-1
after 30 minutes of play.

Glenn Hyde opened the scoring
at the 2:14 mark of the first per-
iod with the first of his two goals.
Torn Lang, who also scored twice,
followed two minutes later with a
low slap shot that easily beat ‘the

“ face hardluck Midshipmen

Pitt gymnasts I travel to

by RICK ROSENTHAL

Coach Bill Savering of Navy
has been rebuilding the gym-
nastics" program there for three
years and this year all the pieces
were supposed to fall in place.
Coach Warren Neiger’s Pitt

squad will travel to Navy, to-.
morrow to challenge that team.
which has been luckless so far.

The Midshipmen gymnasts are
1-3 in Eastern competition losing
close meets to Temple, Penn
State, and g Springfield while

massacring Syracuse. The meet y

against Springfield was a close

one the entire way, with Navy
finally losing 152.8 - 151.9.

The season up until now has
been one frustration after an-
other for the squad as a whole,
but many individualshave shown
outstanding potential.“

Navy is led by a gymnast from
Butler, Pa., Eric Swanson was a
teammate of Joe Gracik, Pitt’s
outstanding, but injured side-
horse performer. In high school
they combined for_ the best 1-2
combination on the sidehorse in
the state. ~

Swanson. is the leading con-

Women rdribblers win 2nd;

oppose Wheeling tomorrow

A_ resounding 51-27_ victory over- Carnegie-Mellon University on
Wednesday night gave Pitt women’s basketball team a 2-2 record for

the season.

Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, the squad will put its .500 mark

on the line as it takes on Wheel-
ing College of West Virginia.
As usual, the game will be play-
ed in the women’s gym at Trees
Hall.

‘This will be the first of three

‘consecutive home games forthe

cagers. An Indiana of Pa. quin-
tet will be coming in next Wed-
nesday, while nearby Carlow
College will hike up Cardiac
Hill on February 21 to battle
Pitt. ‘
C-MU was outclassed by the

I

team. One C-MU player did the
bulk of the scoring for the Tar-
tans, while Pitt received a bal-
ance effort.

Coach Sandra Bullman is ex-
pecting tomorrow’s Wheeling
game to be another tough con-
test. Additionally, she is_ anxi-
ous to ‘see, better fan support at

the contest. Only a sparse
crowd attended last week’s
game with Kent State. '

tender for Eastern honors on the
horse. but he will have some
strong competition if Gracik can

_return by the time Easterns

come around next month.

Gracik says that, “My wrist
s still a bit sore, but Ir’n' hop-
ing to compete against Syra-
cuse next week.” Coach Warren
Neiger isn’t as optimistic as Gra-
cik is about his projected time
for returning, but said, “Only
time will tell.” I

Chris Gardner, Pitt’s injured

,all-around man, is returning to

action at partial efficiency.
He will compete Saturday in
floor exercise after being out
for five weeks. Gracik and
Gardner suffered similar in-
juries of the right wrist and
both are extremely anxious to

return to action.

Mike Hess of Navy,. a‘ con-
sistent nine point performer on
the mat, will be one of the top
performers in the meet as he will
show a double back summer-
sault in his routine. Only one
other man in the Eastern League
can perform it.

Pitt’s Elliot Sanft has added a
back summersault off the parallel
bars to his routine which accord-
ing to Sanft, “has the potential
of raising my score by eliminat-
ing an unnecessary intermediate

swing in my routine.”

  Mermen sink Grov/ers

as Kirkham stars again

by STEVE WILLIAMS

"It was like swimming against
American University,” joked Jer-

ry O’Leary after the mermen to- ,.

tally demolished the Grovers at
Grove City Tuesday night, 73-34.

(“Bradshaw was really pleased,"
interjected Ed Cahill, winner of
the 200 yard backstroke in the rel-
atively slow time of 2:15. The
Panther mermen’ captured all but

one first place in the meet.

Bradshaw won his first swim
meet last year against Grove City
when he was appointed acting
head coach. The meet, held at
Trees Pool almost exactly one
year ago, was highlighted by con-
tested referee calls and an ex-
tremely close) meet. The final
score was 59-53. So for Bradshaw
there was a little bit of ‘sentimen-

, tal satisfaction in the victory.

In this year’s meet there. wasn’t
the keen competition that existed
the year before. Grove City suf-
fered immeasurably from grad-
uation.

Broadhead signs

Atlanta contract

Panthers’ 268 pound defensive

(tackle Howard Broadhead has
signed as a free agent with Atlan-

ta Falcons as he joins teammate
Ralph Cindrich who was drafted
last week by the Atlanta ball club.

The Middletown, N. Y., native
is the sixth Panther to be offered
a pro contract.

meet.” ,

In fact there was only one good .

race in the entire meet, the 200
yard breaststroke with Kirkham
taking the challenge.

Kirkham went out with his
standard 1:10 first hundred estab-
lishing a comfortable body length
lead. He held this lead for six of
the eight laps of the race. The
Grove City swimmerslyly start-
ed to make his move on Kirkham
at this time.

At the seventh turn he had mov-
edup to a equal position with Ken.
Ken rose to the occasion once
again sprinting the final 25 yards
and touching out the opponent by
more than a body length.

Since Kirkham walked on to the
swim team and receives no finan-
cial compensation, it is to his
credit for all that he has done for
the team thus far this season.
