 State Aid Slash Prompts

"66. Years Of Collegiate Journalism”

"Windows will not be washed this

year at the.University, and fac-
 ulty members may be denied new

equipment, due to a, $3 million
slash in the State‘s allocation to
the_University. ‘

...I',§~The unexpected cut, announced
" in September—three months after
-the start of the current fiscal

year, forced administrators to
make up for innocent overspend-
ing during the first quarter of the
fiscal year.

Before setting priorities, Chan-
cellor Posvar sought advice on the

‘ austerity program from adminis-
, ‘trators and top directors.

According to the Chancellor, it

 was decided to hit first all support

areas, such as Physical Plant and
Maintenance, supplies, and mod-
ernization.

Next to be trimmed were some‘
offices of indirect support—Pub-
l_ic Affairs, Student Affairs, and

 Secretary of the University.
‘_ ‘It was decided to try to hold

‘cuts on academic instruction to a
minimum.

The administration was able to
effect two-thirds. of the cuts ($2
million) in non-instruction areas,
the Chancellor reported. Approxi-

' mately $1 million was pruned by ’

deferring programs such as the
expansion of the Book Center and
the refurnisliing of classrooms.

' “The other million," the Chan-

cellor said, “were real cuts. For

example, we're not going to wash
the windows this year.

“Of course,” he added, "this
kind of cut cannot be used indefin-
itely; eventually we'll have to
wash the windows.” The move re-
portedly saved the University thou-

_' sands of dollars.

The remaining one million dol-
lar reduction was assessed the A
Academic areas-‘-the Provost’s
office and the Vice Chancellory of
the Health Professions. The re-
duction amounted to two per cent
of the academic areas’ total bud-
gets.

Tentative office reductions are:

Vice Chancellor for the Health

House to Debate Sex EtluaIityBiII

Tomorrow the U.S. House of
Representatives will consider a
constitutional amendment pro-
hibiting discrimination against
women.

If approved by two-thirds of the
House._two-thirds of the‘ Senate.
and ttfree-fourths of the states.
the amendment will probably
make men eligible for alimony
and possibly make women liable
to the draft. T

The amendment, sponsored by

Congresswoman Martha Griffiths
(D.-Mich.) provides that “equal-

ity of rights under the law shall
not be denied or abridged by the
United States or any state on ac-
count of sex.”

A similar amendment. sponsor-
ed by Senator Birch Ba_vh ID.-
Ind.i and Senator Marlow Cook
«R.-K_v.). will be considered by
the Senate "this month at the ear-
liest." according to a Bayh aide.

The aide. Leslie Hagen. ex-
plained that the amendment is de-
signed to ‘"goad the nation's
courts into action." With “some-

thing on paper,“ Hagen noted. the’

Blakely Named Head
Of Affirmative Action

A new office of Affirmative Ac-
tion Programs has been establish-
ed at the University to insure
equal employment and education-
al opportunities for minority
groups and women throughout the
University. Dr. Edward J. Blake-
ly will serve as director of the
new office and as assistant to the
Chancellor.

V In announcing creation of the
new office and the appointment of
Blakely to head. it, Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar said, "The pur-
pose of the Office of Affirmative

Action Programs will be primari- _

ly to provide us with a new oppor-

tunity to design strategies to in--

sure equitable access by minority
groups and women to the total
range of opportunities within our
University. Dr. Blakely will re-
port‘ directly to me and will pro-
vide me with information for man-
agement decisions regarding both
employment and education oppor-
tunities." '

amendment can be interpreted by

E the courts.”

“There will be a lot of litigation
if and when the amendment is
passed,” Hagen predicted.

The ramifications of the amend-
ment's approval are, uncertain.
According to Hagen. however. at
least two consequences are like-
1'“ .

—Men would become eligible for
alimony; '

—Women would be able to enter
the military service. although
they would not be assigned com-
bat duty.

An amendment to the amend-
ment. offered by Congressman
Wiggins (R.-Calif.) would exempt »
women from the draft. until the
draft expires. T I

If approved, the constitutional
amendment would be the 27th in
U.S. history.

In a related development, the
House Education and Labor Com-
mittee reported a Higher Educa-
tion Bill that would prohibit dis-
crimination against women in
higher education.

A The provision stipulatesthat no
federal money will go to colleges
and universities which discrimin-
ate against women in admissions
policies. faculty salary payments.
or promotion policies.

The bill exempts from the pen-
alty schools where -90 per cent or
more of the students are mem-
bers of the same sex. It requires.
however, that colleges and univer-
sities which have begun to eradi-
cate sex barriers complete the

process within seven years. In-
cluded_in this category are Yale
and Princeton, which have admit-
ted a limited number of women.

Pickets Boycott A &: P, A

Score F arm.er’s Plight

by MIKE SIMON
Night Editor

As the picket line revolved in
front of the Oakland A & P Sup-
ermarket Thursday. an A & P
employeeof 38 years snarled. “I
wish them bastards would clean
themselves up. After all what

'stake do they have in the strike?.

Why don't they go out and get
jobs, they don‘t even know the‘
meaning of work! “

The members and supporters
of the United Farmworkers Or-
ganizing Committee (UFWOC)
picketing the A & P for its poli-
cy of buying non—union grapes
are prone to disagree-some feel

that they do know the m_eaning

of work. '

- Bill Patterson, a UFWOC
worker,'outlined the reasons for
the strike. “The conditions for
the farmworkers are terrible, but
through many picket lines and
much effort we have managedto

get 80 per cent of the grape 3

growers signed with the union,”
he stated. The other 20 per cent,
he added,‘ include approximate-
ly 10,000 workers in the harvest
period.

Patterson charged the A & P,
the largest distributor of non-

‘union grapes in the city, with

"patently ignoring” the farm-
workers’ demand to not sell the

_fruit.

The management of the sup-
ermarket, however, said that the
Tokay table grapes are very sala-
ble, and that they are going to
continue marketing them.

’ All of the 25 demonstrators
agreed that the working condi-
tions of the farmworker are terri-
ble. Gabriel Valencia, co-ordin-

ator of the Pittsburgh UFWOC,
explained in halting English that
he had worked in the fields “for
30 years, I started when I was
12.” He guessed that he had par-
ticipated in over 100 demonstra-
tions in the struggle to get equal
right for the farmworkers. His
political activism, Valencia
claimed,’ eventually cost him his
job as a harvest worker.

, On a fact—finding mission in
1970. the Senate Subcommittee
on Migratory Labor found "over
800,000 children under 16 years
old working in the fields to help

‘support their families. The U.S.

Public Health Service estimates
that while other Americans can
look forward to over 70 years

as a life expectancy, the farm--

workers‘ life expectancy is only
49 years. Maternal mortality and
child mortality at birth are both
120 per cent higher for farm
workers than the national av-
erage. Influenza and pneumonia
run 200 per cent higher than the
national rate. Tuberculosis and
other infectious diseases run 260
per cent higher. The accident
rate for farm workers is 300 per
cent higher than for other U.S.
workers". '

Dan, a blonde demon-
strator from Pitt, listed his rea-
sons for supporting the farm-
workers. “The UFWOC needs all
the support it can get,«" he said.
"At times, though, it. (demon-

strating), can be a very radical-

izing experience.“ He referred

1 to the instance where‘ he was

arrested in a similar protest
march and clubbed while in a
jail cell. He still agreed with
Valencia, that their protest ac-
tivity should stay nonviolent.

As the line shuffled in its lazy
circle, giving leaflets to all pas-
sers-by, it became evident that
with the exception of Valencia,
a Chicano, all of the protesters
were white.

Fabienne. one of the demon-
strators pointed out that "the
blacks have their own situations
to take care of. but we _do have
black support." For instance.
during the Heublein (makers of
Smirnov Vodka) Boycott. some
black bartenders refused to serve
their products, while still others
refused to work."

Again the general consensus
of the marchers seemed to be
that it is “too dangerous for
blacks to participate in demon-
strations.“ As the rent-a-cop in
the store parking lot put it, "it‘s
open season on blacks in this
city."

The A&P store manager, Ray
Leroy, refused to comment on
the proceedings; another of his
employees however, was more
vocal. The dark—haired_ female
putting frozen foods in the dis-

-play case stated, “I don't eat

if they close the store.”

Meanwhile, the protest con-
tinued with a few prospective
shoppers going elsewhere after
hearing the arguments of the
farmworkers.

However one woman with two
small children listened to the
plea of “don’t shop here" and
then marched into the store.
While going through the electric
eye doors, one of her kids ask-
ed, “Mommy, why can’t we

More Johnuys ’

by’LOlS LEVENSON

After seeing the movie John-
ny Got His Gun, members of the
Pittsburgh branch of The Viet-
nam Veterans Against the War
decided to endorse the film by
passing out flyers to entering
viewers.

Seven or eight Veterans and
their supporters came to the
Kings Court Theater, Saturday
and Monday nights dressed in
battle fatigues. They stood out-
side the exits with a large sign
and handed the leaflets to the
.theater-goers. The Vets were
there with the theaters permis-
sion.

Dalton Trumbo’s anti-war film
is about a boy who comes out of
World War I with everything
amputated but his brain. The
Veterans‘ leaflets contained a
plea for people to stop creating
more “Johnnys” with their apa-
thy. They said that many “John-
nys” lie forgotten right here in
Pittsburgh V.A. Hospital.

The Pittsburgh branch of the
Vietnam'_Veterans Against the
war, headed by Bob Clarke. has
about 100 members and is part

of the national organization
whose membership - numbers
20,000.

Recently, a group of veter-
ans from Pennsylvania went on a
96-mile march to Harrisburg.
They congregated on the steps
of the capitol and were suc-
cessful in meeting with State
Representative K. Leroy Ervis.

He has offered them the use
of his lawyers to legally close
down the Veterans’ Parade in

Vets Endorse Film

downtown Pittsburgh October

25th, if they are refused permis-j I I

sion to take part.

Asked about their intermons
for the parade, one of the ‘zeta
said that they hoped to man-li in
mourning for their 350.000 '
"brothers" wounded and killed
in the Vietnam War.-

These Veterans have formed
their group to tell people why
they believe the war wrong.“
They are acutely concerned with
the problem of soldiers returning-

from the war.

'Returning Vietnam veterans

a encounter many problems.’ Next

year another 40,000 heroin ad-’
dicts will return from Asia. In
the Pittsburgh. V.A. Hospital
there are only 4 beds available
for detoxificationand no reha-
bilitation is given. The Viet Vets
already help to rehabilitate .
some of their ‘fbrothers“ that the‘
hospitals return to drug-infested ‘
neighborhoods, but they would
like to have a large-scale pro-
gram.

Twenty percent of the Veter-

"ans are unemployed, (double the

national average.)

The National Organization is
also trying to get a G.I. Bill of
Rights into Congress that will
allot the Veteran wishing to con-
tinue his education $3,000 a
year tuition with $225 a month
for rent and living expenses.
They now get $175 a month for
tuition, books, and living expen-
ses.

out smokey black bags smogging

ture with the, comforting voice
of a. family doctor making a
house call. -

He explained that _transcen-

dental mediatation is a techni-

que taught by Maharish-i Mahesh
Yogi, an Indian sage, which al-
lows its practitioners to reach a

the source of great creative en-

ergy and physical rest. TM is,
, based on the minds natural abil-

ity to move toward greater and
greater happiness and pleasure.

You’ experience this natural
tendency when you have’ been
studying boring material, and
from down the hall you hear
favorite song.
Your mind is naturally drawn to
it, and you start humming along
as the words _run through your
head.

Your mind goes to the song
naturally and effortlessly, with-
out any . concentration or con-
templation on your part.

As the mind moves within de-
siring this finer field of intelli-
gence, it arrives at the'source of
creative energy. This phenom-
enon can be viewed in nature.
As we move from a molecule to

an atom and further break, the’-—

atom into its component -parts,

 

 

we obtain atomic energy, the
greatest known source of ener-

' Experiencing his owncreative

energy has a tremendous effect
on the activity of the meditator.

He finds his creative ability is -

expanded. Thought and creativ-

.ity are easier because he is us-’~

ing more of "his mind, excercis-

ing more of his intelligence.
Maharishi teaches that-' with

more problems needing more

solutions and with }more know-.

ledge to digest and utilize, man
must find a way to tap this
source of creative power within
himself, to meet his problems
and ‘to ..cope with them. TM is
not an escape from problems; it
is a preparation to meet them.

' Maharishi has spread this
technique of TM because it an-

swers some of todays crying
needs. Meditators report a de-
-crease’ in tensions and annoy-
ances. and an increased capabil-
ity to handle problems’. even
emergency situations, as
as an improved physical condi-
tion. ’
Because TM directs the mind
to the source of its intelligence
to’ the very powerhouse of its
creative energy it prepares
meditators for daily activity.

The physiological effects of

TM. have been analysed by Dr,

Keith_ Richard Wallace ’ of
UCLA's School of Medicine. It
must be remembered that TM
is an effortless mental activity
that requires neither contempla-
tion nor concentration, and in’
this respect differs from’ other
forms of meditation such as

yoga. TM sets you mind on an"

angle, and lets it glide down to
the source of your intelligence.

While his subjects where med-
itating, their oxygen consump-
tion decreased, but body meta-.
bolism remained constant. Pulse
rate decreased an’ average of
five beats per minute, and‘ in

some cases, alpha wave pat-,

terns’matched those of Zen Bud-

dist monks ‘who had practiced»

over 30 years’.

Dr. Wallace concluded that TM

is a state of consciousness unlike W

Meditate  

   

 

 

 

the three most common states of ,

consciousness 4 walking, sleeping,
and dreami_ng—and-' is also dif-
ferent from altered states of con.-
sciousness such as _hypnos_is and
autosuggestion. i , '
Because the" physiological ef-
fects of TM are more profound
than sleep, the meditator feels re-
freshed a_nd physically rejuven-

ated after his 15-20 rninute_medi-

tationperiods. “In the AM and the
PM“ is their rule: meditate he-A

»fore breakfast to prepare for the

day, and again before dinner to
prepare for evening activities.

Dr. Wallace suggests some
medical benefits from TM.’ It re-
lieves mental and physical ten-
sion, which is especially signifi-
cant for people who suffer from

hypertension or coronary disease. '

“Like Joe Clark, neither Kathy
nor John -were‘ menaced» by the
black" bags of facial pollution.”

_ John had the shining angelic smile ‘

of ad Charles" Dickens school boy

(although Wisconsin claims him‘
as an alumnus), and Kathy.’s soft

wobbly voice had_the7 quality of

my long-discarded Chatty-Cathy’

doll.

They explained mode_rn man’s
dilemma asthat of a house suffer-
ing from severe cracks. A good
architect knows that the trouble
lies in its foundation. He doesn’t
try to patch the cracks in the
walls. Instead, he goes below the’
surface and makes repairs there.

We see the cracks and frustra-
tions in our lives, but unless we
can go under the surface to the
creative energy ‘and intelligence
TM reaches, our conscious re-
pairs are futile.

As a child, I was never faithful
at practicing my piano lesson. and
it seemed TM might -present the
same hangup for many. But John
explained, "It would be silly not
to practice TM once you had
learned the technique. It would be
like going shopping without stop-
ping at the bank to get the neces-
sary cash. a

“TM makes you a much broad-
er, fuller, happier person,” he
continued. “You will want to car-
ry its effects into your daily ac-
tivity, into your relationship with
all the people you meet and wor
with.” ‘

As teachers for SIMS, Kathy
and John pointed out that although
TM is an effortless natural tech-
nique that anyone can practice,

Because every person needs in-
dividualized instruction, Mahari-
shi has been devoting all his time
to training enough teachers to
provide this instruction all over
the country. Both Kathy and John a -2
studied with him for three months
in Mallorea. Spain.

TEACHING TM
SIMS is the organization behind

fee of $35 from college students “

and $75 from working adults forqié  

TM instruction. Kathy commentggﬁ 
ed, “The TM technique is price- 
less, and you don't pay the fee for
thetechnique. It is used to coordi-
nate teaching, to advertise and
set up lectures (which are free),
and to fund advanced lectures for
people already practicing . the
technique.” ‘

SIMS is one of the few national
organizations with non-profit stat-
us. Kathy and John invited me to _
second lecture at Duquesne Uni- ’
versity, where they would explain
the actual mechanics of TM;  

About 20 students clustered 1"-"=77
around them in a wood-concrete—

sound. During the first in a series“   

of four days of instruction, the"
new meditator is given mantra,
that is, asound. The teacher pre-
scribes the correct mantra for
each individual.

The mantra acts like a good
thoughtdirecting and pulling the
mind inward. A mantra without.
instruction in its proper use is as
ineffective as an ‘electric appli-
ance without a plug. Because the
mantra is the mechanism used to
draw in, meditators rarely reveal
it. John pointedout, "Revealing a
mantra would be like planting a
seed then digging it up to see how.
it‘s doing." ‘

on the individual. This prompted
a kid whose legs stretched out into
the middle of the group to ask
whether the TM experience was
like the drug experience.

John and Kathy had both tried
drugs before TM. Whereas their"

drug experiences were fleeting,

things that passed with the po-
tency of the drug, offering little
power or creativity to cope with
problems, they found the effects
from TM lasting. Kathy conclud-

ed, with John nodding her on. "My
experience with TM has been true
and progressive. If TM were just
a feeling, a mood, it wouldn't have
lasted three years.

plied for instruction, I approach-

about TM at the University of

Colorado. For three years he was -

ity.

Drugs had infected‘ every part
of his life: his posture became

slouched, he had absolutely no en-_

ergy to reach out to people; he
became more and more introvert-
ed, signs of schizophrenia devel-
oped, and all this was overshad-
owed by “the tremendous intake

had been skeptical, and it took
him about a year to become com-
pletely convinced of the technique.
But TM brought results. While on
drugs he had become totally es-

tranged from his parents. TM"

had helped him and his family
unity so much that now even his

parents are meditating.

Rich seemed glad, since one of
the goals of SIMS is to get ten per
cent of the population meditating,
bringing more peace into the
world. Even his roommate was
amazed at TM’s effects. He start-
ed meditating, too. Both leave for
Spain this month to study under
Maharishi and_ become teachers.

Peter Pfund, a Duquesne stu-
dent. with a hint ofa moustache in
the making on his lip, was sitting
with Rich. He learned about TM
in Pittsburgh last year. “When I
think "back now everything seem
ed to have floated along then.“
Like Rich, he had made the drug
scene because “drugs meant peer
group acceptance.“

One night after starting TM he
smoked a joint. The next day his
meditation was very uncomfort-
able. That was the Iast time he
ever reverted. I

Like Rich, his family and
friends have noticed a difference
in him. His whole family is con-
sidering meditation. “And ten
people is no small number," he
quipped. “I've found I’m‘doing
less and accomplishing more. I
can finish a 400 page book in seven
hours with complete understand-

-ing." He was holding a copy of
Hamlet.

“Noise doesn’t even bother me
anymore.” He concluded, “I just

_ can’t find words for TM! "

'But afriend of his could. He re-
members - just coming from his
second lesson in the TM techni-
que when‘ he bumped into a friend
who marveled, “Peter, you look
like you’ve seen the Lord!”

And in a sense he had. He had

. 4-‘A number of years ago a type of
~°‘—‘black” humor thrived, one ex-
.ar‘np1e of which comes to mind
' when viewing the latest anti-war

 gently playing at the King's Court
’: Theater. '

.‘ Two small boys come up to a
.1 house and yell, “Mrs. Jones, can
"Johnny come out and play with
5 us?” A face appearsat the door.
«and a voice ‘softly issues from
within, “Now boys, you ‘know
7" Johnny has no arms or legs.’

g"”'The boys reply, “We know. We
; just want to use him for second
fibase. ' .
 This joke pinpoints accurately
=7Tthe base this film was built on.
 ' The time is one life-span. the
: place is Joe Bonham. and the
Q/message is quite clear: nobody.
" ‘least of all the doctors and gener-
'a_1s, wishes to have his stupidity
° - made common knowledge by his

"__pasket—case, the result of inan-
kinds’ seemingly timeless ignor-

'lick, Johnny Got‘ His Gun, cur- -

ance and a well-dropped Kaiser
shell.

Assuming he has no awareness,
they can him and keep him in a
utility closet with the other
sponges.

This is Joe's world and his at-
tempt to logically orient himself
to it is the subject of the picture.

 

Joe is played by Timothy Bot-
toms and if one were to type—cast
someone for the role of a'vegeta-
ble, they couldn‘t have chosen bet-

this context. and although he does

- a good job. I had a hard time ac-

] cepting Sutherland as Christ -- but

no_amount of minor ﬂaws can keep

it from being a generally brilliant
work.

The central character. Joe Bon-
ham. is played by newcomer Tim-

 

{  i   I

otny Bottoms, who is an easily
manipulated puppef for director
Trumbo‘s tightly-held puppet
strings; an actor who could do Joe
on his own steam might be prefer-

-able, but, oddly, Bottoms‘ charac-

ter isn't as important to the film's
stream-of-consciousness flashback
scenes as are some others.‘

Fortunately, some of those others
are Robards as Joe's father, who
has not been this strong since Long
Day’: Journey Into Night or last
year's‘ brilliant Cable Hague.

I liked Trumbo's concept "of a
sweating Jesus who actually looks
as if He'd been through forty days
and forty nights of travail, and
Sutherland. usually a hopelessly
undisciplined and self-indulgent
performer, is - here tightly rc-
strained and used to general good
effect in the part. And I liked the
way Trumbo used old-time Repub-
lic western star Don “Red” Bar-
ry in a minor part. and ‘Charles
McGraw as Joe's girl's rough
hewn father. '

“Beautiful” is a'word so often
‘mis-used as to have virtually lost
its utility. but I can't think’ of any
other adjective to apply to Diane
Varsi‘s performance as the nurse
who comprehends Joe's legless,
armless. eycless. earlcss, noseless,
mouthless, tongueless post-battle
state and ﬁnally sliows solitary
compassion for him after Eduard
Franz and all the others have vir-
tually dismissed him as a hospital
curiosity. The scene in which she
ﬁnally manages to communicate
with the invalid by spelling out
“Merry Christmas" on his chest is
truly touching. '

Melvin l..aird‘s spirit n;:..iiw.it't-sis it- 
self in the general who izltiinately 
decides against puttiiiglpoeir. Joe
out of his misery, as Jo»: requests
through an unusual forni of Mprse
code. and, instead, consigns him to
the back-corridors olzlivion of
Classiﬁed lnformation. Anything
else would be too simple and strict-
ly against Army policy. The paral-
lcls are too, numerous to name and,
might I add, horrifying.

To be sure, this mu§l_f3c one of
the most truly horrifying and
gruelling ﬁlms cver rriadc, and7t
is every Bit to lrum5o's cTe'dit that
this is so. This is the very type of
cinematic horror to which we very
much need to,be exposed, under
our current state of siege.

Johnny Got His Gun'is not a
pleasant ﬁlm. Even the deceptive
‘Americans’ of the flashback
scenes is lent an extra dimensior
of horror through the “present”
context within which the scenes
are framed. i.e., the utter hope-<
lessness of Joe's hospitalized state. . . 4
There are moments of humor. but -1 T
- that framework again renders
them wholly black. And black has
rarely seemed so oddly healthy. _ ,

Trumbo could have taken the 
Sam Peckinpah route and rubbed
our face in the grue. He has not,
thankfully. Rather, he leaves much
to the viewers‘ imaginations. We
never really see Joe in the hospi-
tal bed. We are left to envision
him in our minds. Which makes his
state all the more unforgettable.

bo‘s part. this. in a ﬁlm of myriad

they are dispelled in the wood-
slied when Mr. Bonham displays
to his son an acute perception of
the universal miniaturization syn-
drome. and an unquestionable
knowledge of what makes a good
fishing pole.

When we first meet his mom, it
is on the eve of dad’s demise, and
tearfully she greets Joe as he re-
turns to the death-house lll.'0l'l'l his
job in the bakery. Her helpless

state is a far cry from the radiant, .

calm strength of spirit she exudes
in a later flashback of -an earlier,
happier period of Joe’s childhood,
when the whole family is seated

around the old Christmas tree lis- .

teningto her-read from the Bible
while father rocks his slippered
foot and looks very much in need
of a spitoon.

This talk of Christmas makes
one think of Christ. and by George,
or should I say by Donald Suther-
land, there He is.

Of course. this implication is
subtly introduced. If you’re not on
your toes, you could quite easily
miss the bearded, long-haired
man with piercing, yet ‘gentle blue
eyes dressed in‘ grey sackcloth,
playing cards with the doughboys
as they await. their ride on the
train over Jordon. And who also
carries on his carpentry trade,
specializing in the construction
of pure white crosses which are
constantly paraded back and forth

in the background.

I don’t know about anyone else,
but the idea that the sudden ap-
pearance of a furry-faced freak
coupled with the antics of a satan-
ic Casey Jones should convey
some sort of profound religious
significance is too ludicrous to
consider. '

“I have no mouth, yet. I must.

scream,” a poet says, and scream ,

Joe does, but who can hear? Aha!

artful insight into nonverbal com-
municationtand an agonizing tal-
ent for manual genital manipula-

than any other human. So long
as his organ is intact, he is a vic-

tim of the same basic drives as

those other two-armed, two-leg-

ged creatures. His only problem
is he can't do it himself.

As we grimace through this
scene with her and her every tug.
we can’t help but picture Mar-y
pulling buckets of water up from
the well, or perhaps lobster traps
being hauled on shipboard.

Symbolism is used a great deal
in the film both effectively and
absurdly, with a marked slant to-
ward the latter since off and on we
are given a glimpse of Joe’s past
through his memories and are
swept along in his fantasies and
dreams. We are never quite sure
which is ‘fantasy and which is real-
ity, and_ neither is he. “How can
you tell your dreams from reality
when you don’t know when you’re
asleep,” he asks.

This division/conflict between
reality and fantasy, and Joe’s

fight to distinguish one f'rom the

other, is captured by the direc-
tors method of alternating black-
and-white (reality) with color
(fantasy) photography. Though
perhaps a bit too obvious, the ef-
fect is, nonetheless, dramatic and
doubtlessly, one of the film’s re-
deeming qualities.

There is also a brief scene
which may raise an eyebrow
among supporters of Women’s
Liberation. American womanhood
is shown by actress Sandy Brown
Wyeth as a red-haired, red-lipped
woman of the night who is the
mother of a polo-playing bastard.

Finally, the ‘universal question
of mercy-killing arises as Joe
breaks the communication bar-
rier. Literally “using his head”

«gran...» Mundanes 

by RAY-GRANT
365 Days
by Ronald J. Glasser, M.D.
288 pages, New York:
George Braziller, $6.95

An alternate title for ilonalcl
Glassers 365 Days might easily
be: The 365th Book Written About
the Nam. The unfortunate thing
about all this is, anyone with any
writing talent at all would be do-
ing his country a great disservice
by putting his life on the line when
M.D.'s like Glasser (who have
friends in the publishing business)
can put such sick situation into
such clinical terms. The upshot:
the book is as welcomeas a tetanus
injection. .

Not that his technique cannot do
the circumstances justice; it of-
ten succeeds where a more flow-
ery hand might not:

“Taking a clamp out of his pock-

, et, he took his hand off the wound

and with the blood swelling up
again, stuck'the clamp blindly into

the jagged hole, worked it up into
the groin, and snapped it shut.”

Along these lines, tensely, writ-
ing like a feverish surgeon trying
to save a life rendered unrecog-
nizable by gore, Glasser shocks
and stuns us medicinally, hurting
and helping at the same time.

The last account. of a boy badly
burned, having to have most of the
skin on his body peeled off piece by
piece by a churning whirlpool. is
part:-':iilarly striking. The doctor
pours a stinging chemical on his
ci:>.i;rel_l stomach as the patient
tries .'iot to scream. Most of them
don't. ave are told.

Another tragic anecdote. of an
unfortunate ‘18-year-old medic
whose grenade is triggered by an
enemy bullet.

“He struggled for a moment to
pull it off and then, according to
the other medic working with him, _
he jumped out of the aid station,
and_l<ept running, with the gre-
nade bouncing against his chest

     

until it went off.”

Where Glasser fails. mundan-
mg us to death the way a doctor
will, is in trying to lift his book
above the level of an extremely
well-written pathological diag-
nosis. He tries to write, but his
hand i_s a shaky one atbest.

al but not quite precise enough,
and where he does get precise it
does us the least good, in never-
explained technical jargon‘.

His figures of speech are often
adequate but hardly ever eye-
stopping, and at times he blatant-
ly overdoes it. ‘

And the soldiers. of course. all
speak in that laconic. lewd swear-
ese we all know and don't believe.

These "speeches are no more
suggestive of real human beings
than the writing on the wall of
any neighborly rest room. A fur-
ther, more general irritant, is one
that is incidentally characteristic

   

schooled man like 'Glasser should
have had sense enough to avoid.

fied by the quotes on the book's-

‘Willie, "can kiss my juicy ass.

The Tenants is not Bernard
Malamud’s best novel. Missing
from Lesser and Willie is the
iron spring of will thatalmost
determines, the fates of other
Malamud sufferers. In stepping
into a wider milieu Malamud
intensifies his prose with more
frequent, lush metaphor and ly-
rical streams of consciousness.

‘Though sometimes hypnotic.
the result is more often the weak-
ening of character. Willie, nev-
er seen but through Lesser’s
eyes, is a barely believable
black man. Malamud runs him
through the gamut of cliches
"motherfuckin jiveass ofay jew
slumlord bastard,” and makes
Willie's writing parrot the work
of almost every‘ black who has
ever written. Lesser’s develop-

ment suffers from the inclusion
of a character nearly his equal,

and the twining of so many maj-
orideas.

,But.Malami__1d, even at his less-
than—best, is unsightful
thought-provoking.

Of his characters, Malamud
has said: “A Malamud character
is someone who fears his fate,
is caught up in it, yet manages
to outrun it . . . " For Harry

Lesser, the race withfate is nevr

ercwon. Will black and white,
black and jew, form and feeling
be reconciled? Malamud, as
Lesser, searches for the ending.

Richard Benjamin gradually
grows accustomed to the prom-
iscuity at the porno house-the
buxom beauties enticing him from
the screen, the little gray men

Well, Richard, the film at the

the one you star in at the Fiesta

Benjamin is the young stock-

There are a number of things
thatpuzzle me about this other-
wise simple picture. I wonder
for instance. if Richard Benja-
min is ever going to become a
complete actor. I just know that,
lurking beneath that skinny
schlemiel exterior is the stuff of
which Oscars are made.

I also wonder why producer-
director Lawrence Turman didn’t
walk off the set when they
showed him the shallow, punch-

_less screenplay for this film. I ~

wonder why he bothered to put
the actors through their paces-
he must have known how banal
the film was.

unsophisticated of me, to say
nothing of possibly chauvinistic,

The K.-S.  
Of Death

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

Illllllllllllllllillllllﬁ 1:’

One thing that Navy Coach Rick Forzano can't be accused
of is aboundingconfidence in his football team this year.

After listening to him discuss his squad yesterday at the
Pitt luncheon, it was not hard to perceive that he foresees doom
on Saturday when the Panthers oppose the Midshipmen at the

‘Stadium at 1‘: 30.

No wonder Forzano is not optimistic. In“-the past three
weeks, he had to endure watching his defense relinquish 151

points, while his offense could muster only nine tallies;

Forzano openly ‘admits that “we don’t have a real good
passing team this year——we don’t-have many good receivers.”
Compounding this problem is the scramble at the Middie quar-
terback slot. One week before the start of the football season,

Ade Dillon, the top man for the
transferred to West Virginia. A

The lack of a passing attack
prompted Forzanoto install a’ Wish-
bone running system. “Maybe we were
wishing for something,” he jokes.

- However, his offense’s inability to
move the ball is a focal point of the
‘club’s multitude of problems. ‘-‘Our of-
fense just can’t move the ball; the de-
fense tires out because they are al-
waysplaying,” he ‘lamented over the

  Big Turnout Expected
As Cubs-Lions Clash  

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

The Panther freshman football
squad will be out for double re-
venge when they confront the Lit-
tle Nittany Lionsthis Friday, 3
p.m. at Beaver Stadium, Univer-
sity Park, before an estimated
crowd of 12,000 fans.

The Cubs will be seeking’ their
first victory of the season, having
already been handed a shattering
33-14 loss by the West Virginia
Little Mounties. Also aiding the
Cub drive to win is the memory
of last year's battle with their
Penn State rivals.

With only seconds remaining in
the game, the Pitt frosh led the
Lions 20-14. On a fourth‘ down
play, the Cubs attempted a field
goal but a Lion blocked it._ A Penn

They connected for the extra
point and ended the game one
point ahead of the Pitt freshmen,
21-20.

"Were anxiously awaiting the
first game—our game with Pitt,"
commented Lion's frosh coach
John Chuckran.

f‘We've had excellent practices
but you can‘t tell from practice
how you’ll do in a game."

Chuchran feels the Little Nit-
tany Lions are defensively strong
but that the offense is as yet a
question mark in his mind.

“The team’s pretty strong de-
fensively," said Chuckran. “We've
scrimmaged against our varsity
and we looked pretty good.

“Really everything is weak un-
til proven in a game. But, at this’

. point, “ the '-defense ,jovershadows— ~ ‘

- by MARK SIGMON

“We have a real good-shot at -

winning five games yet this sea-

son. This is a talented football

squad. and we should have beat-
en West Virginia. Against Navy
on Saturday, we'll just have to
keep‘ on coming all the way."

As towheaded Bob Kuziel..the

Panther center and one of its most
underrated performers. com-

mented on the 1971 Cat pigskin _

team, a feeling of steadfast de-
termination. marked his words.
His sturdy 6‘4”. 240 pound frame
only served to emphasize the sin-
cerity of his replies. ~

A graduate of Manlius Prep in
New York, KuzieLhas been a cen-
ter all his football life. Although
Bob did not start his sophomore
year, he has played in 23 conse-
cutive varsity contests.

“I played behind Dave Magyar

‘in 1969,” said Kuziel. “He (Dave)

was All-East that season, and. I
think I might have helped him

A .achieve it by playing behind him.’

But, I never thought of switching‘
positions just to get a better shot
at starting back then.”

“Kuz” has no real preference on

blocking strong, hugetdefensive

behemoths or-their smaller-, but
quicker counterparts. He feels,
however, that an opponent play-

’ ing over him is somewhat easier

to handle on a run than a pass.
Particularly upset ' over Pitt‘s

20-9 loss at‘ the hands of the Moun- ’
taineers, Kuziel explained, “We ‘
' moved the ball very well against '

West Virginia. When a team gains
over, 300 yards total offense; they
.mus't‘_be doing something right. It‘
boiled down to our not being able
to make the big ‘play when we had

to. Even more-important,’ their

(WVU's') guys were up incredibly

_ high f'or the game. [ _. »

j “Close games are" won ibythe
squad that makes the fewest mis-
takes. We simply broke down on_

the "key plays at ,Morganto'wn.

Against Navy, we don’t dare think
ahead. Saturday is the turning
point of the season. We are not
expecting the Middies to be ex-
ceptionally tough, but I know’ I
had a lousy game against them

Being a senior, Bob hopes to
make the pros. ‘When questioned
as to the possible’ future in the
NFL. ."Kuz“ laughed and remark-

ed, ‘'1 try not to think about the

just a matter of game experi-
ence," he said.

Chuckran cited Jim Rosecrans,
a 228 pound linebacker and run-
ning back as a possible standout
in Friday’s contest.

"Jim has. done pretty well dur-
ing practice and I think he'll do
well," stated Chuckran.

The starting position at’ quar-
terback will fall to either Don
Tarosky or John~Clark. Clark for
the past two yearsvhas been the
Pennsylvania state javelin cham-
pion. ‘

Despite his confidence in the
performance of his players,
Chuckran feels Pitt should be fav-
ored in the game.

'‘Pitt has_ alreadyghad a game
andV-.ha,s- already seen ‘how they
perform

 

      

iina game:posi't_ion 2‘-F‘,  '- '

draft (the player draft)? My

dream is to play professional foot-

. ball. Right now, I’m more con—»-

cerned with helping Pitt win.“

Offensive linemen have to ac- .
cept thefact that they seldom get .
any headlines. Kuziel realizes this

and has no axe to grind.

“Offensive linemen don’t make P

the spectaculanplays. Backs and
ends score touchdowns, lineback-

ers and safetymen intercept pass- 
es, and defensive linemen sack‘

the passer. Guys like me have to
do theirijob, that’s all. What real-'

ly surprises me is’ that I have al-’ ~
ready appeared on TV twice this ~

Kuziel insists. that Coach Carl I

could only‘ benefit from the in-.'_’

Ever since Bryant Salter went to the San
Diego Chargers football teams rookie camp as
their fifth round draft choice late this summer.
he had the desire to be with the Chargers at
Three Rivers Stadium on October 3 for the game
against the Steelers. -

Aside from participating in a possible San
Diego victory. which didn‘t occur. Salter want-
ed to prove to everyone that he could make and
stay on the roster of "a professional football
team.

Salter. a native of Pittsburgh. wanted to re-
assure those who had faith in his ability all along.‘
as well as to make believers of those who didn’t.

“Of course, it’s a thrill to play in Pittsburgh,”
he said after the otherwise disappointing -game
for him. “The game (his third as a pro) now
makes me a one-year veteran. Another reason I’m
glad to be here is for those people that had faith
in me from the start, but I'm just as glad to be
here for those who didn't think I could make it.”

The road to Pittsburgh and to his transforma-
tion from collegiate star to professional athlete
was no easy turn of events for the former Pitt
track and football standout. '

"It was really tough,“ he conceded. "I was
really lucky to stay away from pre-season injury.
If I would have been injured. I might not have
had the chance to have a favorable showing. I
wasn’t sure I was going to make it, but a couple
of things helped me out.

“San Diego used a bump and run defense,

which we also used at Pitt,’ and I was physically-

preparedl,” he added.

.Even~though Salter is on the roster, he has
yet to see any action in The National Football
League, aside from his role on the specialty team.

A Salter Proves Himself

 

BRYANT SALTER is‘gIad he made it.

But, if confidence were the only trial. Salter
would already, be a superstar. The role that for-

'mer Oakland Raider defensive safety Dave Gray-

son, played and his track experience gained here
at Pitt rate as prime pluses to his career so i'ar.

"Track really helped me." he ‘said, “I'm more

thankful to my track background than that I had

in football. Track really taught me how to stay
physically and mentally aware at all. times.
“Grayson, after he was cut by Oakland, coach-
ed here for awhile and I learned a lot of foot-
ball trom him. We would go.in and come out to-

A gether, and he would explain a lot of things to

me. I really learned a lot of football from him.”

Salter thinks that playing in the pros is very
different from college.‘ He refers to college
games as a more gungho type thing while the pros
serve as entertainers.

“Just the title pro makes it different" he said.

(Coutinzurd from Pane 10)

"People pay to be entertained. It
is more dedicated and more men-
tal than college and. of course. we
get paid for it."

Salter is the youngest member
of the young San Diego team and
feels that all he needs is a chance
to play.

“In the exhibition season I play-
ed about half the time. I know I
can handle a pro receiver. I
think I am ready now. All I need
is a chance to play."

Because Sunday's game was a
nerve racking battle all the way
down to the final gun and because
San Diego‘s defensive backfield
was doing a commendable job,

Salter spent the bulk of the after-
noon kneeling on the sidelines and
scratching his afro. But. when
Terry Bradshaw fumbled the ball
on the Steeler 20-yard line with a
minute and a half to go. it seemed
Bryant would get his chance.

Had the Chargers scored, Sal-

ter would have gone in as an ex-
tra safety in the prevent defense.
The Charger offense faded, how-
ever, and Salter’s chance to play
went with it.

Sooner or later. though. Salter‘s
chance will come. Maybe next
week against Kansas City.
