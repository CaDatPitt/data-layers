 Tower Barber Shop
Installation Sought

By JIIVI ADELMZAN

Men’s Dorm Council is seeking the installation of a
barber shop in the Towers for the convenience of ‘male stu-
dents at the University. To make room for the barber shop,
an authorization has been made to move the laundry S€1'V1Ce
from its present site to the recreation room in Tower B.
MDC President Harvey Lefton said that such a move would
' provide much-needed space for the laundry service -and also

open the possibility for the barber shop._
At Wednesday night’s meeting, a resolution was passed co-or-

dinately with Women’s Housing Board and Saga Food Service urging
1 students to return their trays in the cafeteria. It was noted that

many students encountered dif-
ﬁculty in ﬁnding a place '60 Sit.
because empty trays Were Clut-
tering the tables.

Pete Baer, social committee
chairman, armounced that MDC
and Saga Food Service will co-
sponsor a dinner-dance on March
5, at which four minstrels will
wander through the cafeteria and
play music upon request at in-
dividual tables.

In other business, Lefton ex-
pressed concern because MDC
has not received any veriﬁcation-
concerning. the naming of floors
in the Towers. The group had
petitioned the Student Affairs
Committee for permission to -use

existing names ,to permanently

designate the Towers’ residence

The Council also moved to do-
nate $100 to the “S” award fund,
joining with Student Govern-
ment, Interfraternity Council,
Omicron Delta Kappa, and the
Dean of Men’s Office as contribu-
tors. The annual award enables
a male junior student to study

Montagu Claims:

Women Superior in Everything Except  Muscles  

Women are superior to
men constitutionally, emo-
tionally, and intellectualy, in
fact, in all respects except
muscular power, weight, and
bone size. These factors,
however, only enable men to
resort to violence more efficient-
ly. .

With this statement Dr. Ashley
Montagu, chairman of -the De-
partment of Anthropology at Rut-
gers University, began his niid-
day series address on “The Nat-
ural Superiority of Women” to
an overﬂow crowd in the Student

,_ Union" Ballroom, Wednesday.

“It is true,” Dr. Montagu con-
tinued, “that men also have a
higher metabolism r.ate than
women, but this is only because
they weigh more and means that
they go up in smoke more quick-
ly and die sooner.”

Women, on the other hand, are

‘ the more valuable of the species
‘ because they bear children and
must be strong _enoiigh;j-.to-, do sow

   
 

to the Housing Policy Committee
for an open house to be held dur-
ing Winter Weekend. According
to the proposal, the dormitories
wﬂl be open from 2 to 5 p.m. on
Feb. 7.

Harold Bumberg, secretary of
MDC, reported that there have
been frequent complaints by men
students about treatment at the
University Student Health Serv-
ice. Bumberg took issue with a
recent poll conducted by the
Health Service which showed
that 99 per cent of the students
were satisﬁed with treatment

they had received at the center.

New Women’s Housing Approved;
Modiﬁed Proposals Start in Fall

By MARSHA REHNS

An administrative-student advisory committee to Helen P. Rush, approved student
proposals for changes in housing regulations with certain modiﬁcations. The changes will
go into effect at the start of the fall trimester.
Undergraduate Women who will be 21 years of age before September 1 will be per-
mitted to live in off-campus housing. No students will be able to move from dormitory
housing if they reach 21 after September 1. A _
Selected upperclass women will be given housing in eight Amos Hallsuites now

maybe that wouldn’t be so bad

Crying is the way in which
women can restore themselves to
a state of equilibrium but tears
are usually considered a sign of
weakness. As children men are
taught that only sissies cry, Dr.
Montagu added, and once they
are adult they cannot cry even
if they want to. For this reason
they are considered emotionally
superior to women.

“Men,” he pointed out, “weep
in other ways; through their skin
in the form of boils, from their
minds in nervous breakdowns.
and from their stomachs in ul-
cers. This is the Superior usage
of emotions on the part of males.”

women have never had wives to

Since the first intelligence tests
were conducted in 1908, women
have always scored higher on

women have even done as well
in mechanical tests.

occupied by offices and graduate
women. The desk will be staffed
24 hours a day. To be eligible to
live in the suites Women must
have completed 90 credits by the
end of the spring trimester.

A member of each senior suite
in Amos Hall will serve on a
committee which will recommend
to Savina Skewis, director of
women's housing, housing po-
licies separate from those of the
Housing Board. The committee

.will have jurisdiction over cur-
fews, regulations concerning men
in the dorms,’ and special cases
of credits.

A committee composed of the
Associate Dean of Women, the
Director of Women’s Housing,
senior assistants in upperclass
areas, head residents, president
of AWS and chairman of Housing

Board will select the 64 women

1 to live in the suites on the basis

of grades and “mature sense of
social responsibility.”

Students in Amos'Hall will be
permitted to purchase regular
meal tickets or dinner tickets and
room contracts will be signed for
two terms, unless the student ex-
pects to graduate at the end of
one term. In such a case, va-
cancies will be ﬁlled by the ad-
ministrative committee.

It was stressed that the hous-
ing in Amos Hall will be only an
experiment and continuation of
the project will depend on health,
grades, housekeeping standards,
and social standards.

According to Miss Skewis, costs

for living in the suites will re-

main the same as those in other

dorms. The 65 women living in"
"the suites will represent’ about

one-third of the senior women.

Applications for housing in the
suites will be sent out Feb. 12
along with regular housing ap-
plications. “We are currently
working with Housing Board and
senior assistants to formulate the
kind of questions to help select
girls to live in Amos.”

Miss Skewis continued: “This

puts much more responsibility on
the_ girls but it is very exciting.
The number of women living out-
side of the regular housing will
give more leadership to juniors.”

Jane Gould, a senior, who

worked for the proposal, com-.

mented, “This decision incor-
porates the basic goal for which
the original proposals were made:
to increase the amount of indi-

-vidual responsibility each stu-

dent must assume as a vital part
of his education.”

Members of the housing com-
mittee included: Dr. Alan C.
Rankin, vice-chancellor; Dr. Put-
nam Jones, acting dean of the

School of Liberal Arts; Dean 

Bush; John Vrana, Student Gov-
ernment president; Faith Leitzel,
AWS president; Dorrie Brand,

Ed at dSt' h  
Ity JANE GOULD _
The eruptive force with which the 20th century burst upon mankind outmoded
some forms, and many styles, of art. With the new century were born revolutions in

the existing arts, which were to continue to be relevant only t-hrough growth and change.
There is one form, however, which is a pure product of the new age. It emerged at the

/ turn of the century, with the dynamism necessary for its survival ,and developed, within

the course of a generation, to serve as a uniquely effective spokesman for an age whose
spokesmen are legion.

Photography is a new art. It has no old masters to serve as guidelines, either to be followed or
repudiated; it has no precedents to stiﬂe "its development. It alone, with the questionable exception
of electronic music, funtions to unite the technology characteristic of its time with the emotion neces-
sary to an artist; one does not serve the other, but both are joined into a uniﬁed-whole, whose purpose
is to search and experiment.  A

There is no more representative ﬁgure in this medium of expression that Edward Steichen,
who came of age in 1900, just in time to lead photography from the experiment into the realm of art.
A Life in Photography (Doubleday and Company, 1963, $19.50) is the autobiography of this man; at
the same time, it is an intimate history of photographic develop'ment—a story young enough to be

‘ vi_tal, new enough to be honest, important enough to be thrilling.

The book itself, as is evident by the price, falls into the luxury class of “art” books. Photog-
rapihy is the most natural and successful subject of such a book; here the originals lose none of their
eﬂectiveness in the technical process of reproduction —indeed, for some, this is their primary raison
d’etre. The photographs trace the development of photograph, and of Steichen the photographer, from

A his earliest work in Milwaukee, with his family and home as subject matter, to the sophistication of

-later portraits, whose subjects represent the leaders in 20th century art forms.

Steichen traces the various movements in the development of photography of which he was
often a guiding force. His profound admiration for for Rodin, who in turn came to respect Steichen‘;
artistry enough to commission some of it, is the closest Steichen comes to revealing personal emo-
tionalism in the text. His contact with eminence began with Rodin, and traced its way toward the
variety seen in his expressive portraits of Isadore Duncan, Charlie Chaplin, and Carl Sandburg, who
happens to be Steichen’s brother-in-law. ' '

Steichen was a prime mover in the development of fashion photography as an art. He began
with Vogue, took the disgrace out of “commercial” photography, and traveled on to the less rariﬁed
ﬁeld of advertising, proving here too, that “commercial” and “art” are not mutually exclusive terms.

Steichen’s widest popular acclaim was aroused by an exhibit of his unrehearsed glimpses into the
emotions of people throughout the world, ﬁrst displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York,
in 1955. Entitled “The Family of Man,” this group of photographs has been collected in another book

. of that ‘title; none of the actual photographs. which made up that exhibit ‘are included here. But one

of the most fascinating chapters of the book is about the exhibit; the pictures which follow the
chapter show some of the work done preliminary to the exhibit, the set-up of the exhibit itself, and
several candid shots of people reacting to the exhibit when it was sent to Moscow. .

. The narrative, divided chronologically into the diverse segments of Steichen’s life, is factual
prose withlittle style. Perhaps its most admirable feature is that it does not even attempt to match
the poetry of the accompanying photographs; this would be a job for a poet, and Steichen knows his
own poetry is best expressed through a lens. Yet the story itself is such a vital one that the bare
facts are all that is"needed. This is a book to browse through, to pore over, to serve as a point of de-
parture in discovering the aesthetic. It is a book to cherish and to share—-there_ is no need here for
a new source of verbal quotations. ‘ '

 

Travelservice Aids

University Community

.A -huge Pan-American wall map, a few planes inthe win-
dow, and a poster or two are the only external signs of the
University Travel Service located_ at 3955 Forbes Avenue.
“We like to keep it simple,” says John Bohna, owner of the
service. “We are here as a convenience to students and
faculty of the University and the general public of the

Oakland area.
The University Travel Service
. has been in existence for six years,
and formerly had its headquar-
ters in the Quadrangle. The bu-
reau is in no way affiliated with
the University.

The Travel Service “can han-
dle anything when you leave
your front door,” according to Mr.
Bohna. This includes airline,
steamship, rail, and bus. Instead
of having to call each airline for
information, the office can obtain
information on all airlines. The

Travel Service fee, and tickets
are the same price as if they
were bought at the terminal. ’

In addition to trips home, the
University Travel Service ar-
ranges student European tours,
skiing weekends, and other vaca-
tions. They can also obtain pre-
paid tickets for guest speakers
or other guests coming to the
University. A

The Service maintains a well-
qualiﬁed staff, all of whom are
former airline employees.

The University will soon

The Chancellor told Faculty

“The cost-cutting,” the Chan-

mounting over a period of years.”

The Chancellor emphasized,
however, that the cost-cutting
would not curtail the Universi-

“The substance of our academic
progress will be carefully pro-

He continued: “In recent years

ents of plan, women highly respect-

ed on campus for proven. maturity of thought who believed in an ideal and believed in its
need to be tested in a university community. They drew up the proposal and presented it
to Women’s Housing Board which in turn set up a panel for open discussion among the
women it would affect. A referendum follow ed to further feel out student opinion —- all
of this following responsible channels for presenting and airing a proposal.

Dean Rush likewise talked to the girls themselves, took part in the panel, and con-

; ysulted University personnel before she made her ﬁnal decision. She explains that she ar-
rived at the ﬁnal plan after careful consideration of the initial suggestion and designed

it to be, as the women had wanted, most beneﬁcial from an educational standpoint.

Thus the proposals were a success from more than one point of view. Seven women
proposed an idea that was incorporated into policy. But perhaps more important is the
future implications of this process of change. The administration has shown quite mark-
edly that when students feel strongly enough about a certain issue and can support it and
present it in a mature way, they will consid or it and where feasible use it. A

' You can not blame an unresponsive ad ministration when the students don’t ask for
answers. But when they do, and they use re sponsible techniques, the administration will
answer and at times, as with the curb cuts for wheelchair students and recent housing
proposals, do their best to co-operate. The proposals were indeed successful.

  The Barking

 

Mr. Kenneth Eskey of
the Pittsburgh Press has
branded The Pitt News a
“barking dog.” I thank him

for the compliment.

He points to us as “a sharp
contrast to the wholesome
dullness of the other college
papers in town.” Again, I
thank him for the compli-
ment.

For it is a
function of
the college
newspaper to
be a watch-
dog for the
student body.
And it is a
function of a

Missnelaney watch-dog to
bark. A watchdog perks up
his ears in the darkness and

 

growls at the ﬁrst" sounds of »

intrusion.

He will not be stilled by
tossing him a milkbone. Nor
will we. _ r

A university is not de-
signed to turn out Doris
Day’s who spend their after-
noons in their polished kit-
chens baking apple pies. In-

stead, it must foster sensi-
A tive students with consider-
ed opinions who are willing
‘ to confront, and capable to

deal with, the intellectual

V , and social problems of a
‘ complicated human society.

It must foster creative re-
sponsibility; and it must fos-

A ter frankness and ferment as

the vehicle for enacting this
responsibility. Surely it must
then too foster a barking

: dog.

AT PARENTS’ ‘ Weekend

‘ , last year, Vice - Chancellor

Rankin explained to the mo-

‘. thers and fathers of new
ij freshmen .what they should

expect at the University of

 Pittsburgh. “Here we hope
" you will ﬁnd unsettled minds

he said. “I,f.you, do, thenwe

     

track.” If the student news-

paper here were paciﬁed
with milkbones and satisﬁed
with “wholesome dullness,"
the University would indeed
be on the right track-—but
in the wrong direction.

The Pitt News is not-that ’

easily satisﬁed, however.
Mr. Eskey is right in his
statement that The Pitt
News is “published by the
students.” It is not a public
relations’ organ: it is a news-
paper, dedicated to the inter-
est of the student. Through

its news pages, its feature"

stories, its editorial com-
ment, and its “Letters” sec-
tion, it functions to inform
the student of the events "of
the University, to awaken
him to its intellectual op-
portunities from philosophy
of science lectures to poetry
readings, to remind him of
his obligation to the Uni-
versity and the community
and their obligation to him,
and to provide a forum for
his own opinions. Of course
mistakes and oversights are
made, but they are regret-
ted, and when possible, cor-
rected. ‘

MR. ESKEY’ is wrong,
then, in his second conten-
tion that the University of
Pittsburgh student newspa-
per is “dedicated to the prop-
osition that Chancellor Ed-
ward H. Litchﬁeld makes
plenty of mistakes.”

The University is striving
for excellence. The Pitt News
is merely trying to do its
part toward the achievement
ment of this goal — particu-
larly where the student is
directly involved. ‘

Excellence is an expensive
standard; there are bound to

be budget squeezes on the ’

will never be attained. The
student considers himself a
vital area; it is the job of
The Pitt News to voice this
consideration — and to de-
fend it. Excellence is also a
very high standard; there
are bound to be mistakes on
the way. Intellectual prog-
ress is not made, however,
by denying these mistakes,
but rather, by realizing and
dealing with them. Progress
is not made by squelching
criticism, but by correcting
its causes.‘

THE ADMINISTRATION
of t-he University of Pitts-
burgh is to be commended
for realizing the value—and
even the necessity — of a
free student press sensitive
to the goals of the Univers-
ity and to the needs of the
student, a student press that
does not satisfy itself with
commenting on “the cheer-
ing at basketball games”
which Mr. Eskey mentions
‘in his article. This attitude
unfortunately is not shared
by the administrators of all
colleges; often direct and in-
direct censorship tempers
the searchings of the unset-
tled mind and narrows the
horizons of the collegiate
press. University students,
too, are to be commended,
not ‘only -for their implicit
support of this freedom, but
also for those criticisms of
their student newspaper
which reveal their own per-
sonal commitment ‘to stand-
ards of excellence in college
journalism. - ‘

 ESKEY REQUESTS,

.“Leave us a few barking.

dogs.” He can be certain that
the students, the News Staff
and the administration of
the University of Pittsburgh
will insure that The Pitt
News is one of them. For it
is a duty, of The Pitt News
to have an unsettled ‘.;mind
and broadening horizons;

Found. Wanting
Editor, The Pitt News:

Shakespeare once stated that
arrogance is “the disease of not
listening . . .” One begins to un-
derstand this statement after a
close reading of Barry Shaw’s un-
fortunate review of the Pitts-
burgh Symphonetta. (Pitt News,
Jan. 18.)

Mr. Shaw is apparently so en-
amored of ._the vitriolic style of
Hale and Hanslick, that he, like
they, often misses the mark en-
tirely, in order to revel in the
heady inebriation of his own lit-
erary style.

In the ﬁrst place, Mr. Shaw
rushes furiously past the charm-
ing (and beautifully performed!)

' “La Gazza«Ladra Overture” by

Rossini, in order to allow him-
self more space for a subjective
and ill-informed attack on Yagh-
jian’s approach to the “Haffner
Symphony” of Mozart.

Mr. Shaw would have liked
“soft” violins. We wonder how
Mr. Shaw would have produced
“soft” violins in a hall contain-
ing innumerble mirrors and two
chandeliers. The fault here could
truly lie with “hard” violins, an
extremely “hard” hall, or with
Mr. Shaw’s calloused ears.

Finally, Mr. Shaw did not like
the “ﬂuttering” Woodwinds in the
Brahms’ “Hungarian Dance No.
1”; he did not consider that
Brahms might have written for
“ﬂuttering” Woodwinds, or that
Mr. Yaghjian (who would seem
to be an acceptable judge), want-
ed “ﬂuttering” Woodwinds. No,
Mr. Shaw didn’t like “ﬂuttering”
Woodwinds and, ipso facto‘ “ﬂut-
tering" Woodwinds are a bad
thing.

We might add that Mr. Shaw’s
descriptive powers leave some-
thing to be desired. For instance,
in attacking Mr. Thaviu’s rendi-
tion of the Mendelssohn Violin
Concerto, he discusses “some
blending innuendos.” We're not
exactly sure what “blend-innu-
endos” are, but we are sure that

if Mr. Shaw liked them, they.

PIA?“/%’. ”

While We are examining illiter-
ate expressions, we feel obliged
to mention another classic: “near
genti]ity.”‘ Mr. Shaw actually
used this meaningless phrase in
connection with Mozart. We
would suggest that “the near gen-
tility of Mozart” is something
like the near competence of most
student music critics.

In closing, we would merely
like to state that this arrogant
little review of Mr. Shaws was
concocted of a subtle compound
of brutality and bad taste.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Where was Barry Thursday
night? It seems hard to believe
that he was at the Pittsburgh
Symphonetta’s concert. The per-
formance which we were priv-
ileged ‘to hear was of high qual-
ity, or at least the audience
thought so. The performance was

so well received that two encores
were performed. '

From the vitriolic tone of the ~

review one suspects Barry had a
bad day Thursday, and the Sym-
phonetta was made to suffer for
it. We hope Barry works out his
problems, but not in the form of
reviews for The Pitt~News, please!

By PETE HORN

This is the first half of a
discussion of the newest vol-
ume in the University's Phi-
losophy of Science series.

We have -heard a great
deal lately of a recurring
fancy — the University
“aspiring to” Ivy League
status. In its Philosophy of
Science program it has more than
achieved that sacrosanct position.
Beyond the Edge of Certainty:
Essays in Contemporary Science
and Philosophy (Prentice Hall,
287 _pp.; $8.95), published this
month, represents one project of
that burgeoning program. History
professor Robert G. Colodny edits
and introduces the book.

Based on the University’s an-
nual lecture series, which began
ﬁve years ago, the essays in this
highly priced book are expanded
versions of seven such lectures
given by noted scholars. The sec-
ond in a series of collections to
be based on the lectures, Beyond
the Edge of Certainty succeeds
Frontiers of Science and Philoso-
phy. Volume three, Mind and
Cosmos: Studies in the Philoso-
phy of Science, also edited by
Professor Colodny, is currently
in preparation. The romanticized
titles connote an appeal to the
educated public as well as to
philosophers of science.

Volume one was composed of

six unrelated essays. The second
attempts -a greater uniﬁcation.
With apologies to John Donne,
we might say: No discipline,
theory or language is an island,
separated from other disciplines,
change, moral. problems, presup-
positions or a historical back-
ground.

The initial essays, by Norwood
Russell Hanson and Brian Ellis,
deal with Newton’s laws of mo-
tion. They amply document the
contention that philosophy is in-
extricable from scientiﬁc theor-
izing. Hanson, for example, la-
boriously shows that a concept
so taken for granted as Newton’s
First Law can still be as intrigu-
ing and wide-open for scrutiny as
any contemporary theory.

Still, these articles are un-
abashedly technical, though
largely nonmathematical. Who
but a philosopher would under-
stand Hanson’s reference to “‘an
unfulﬁlled hypothetical’ or ‘coun-
terfactual conditiona1?”’ Al-
though some philosophical and
scientiﬁc grounding are neces-
sary for fullest appreciation,
many concepts can prove fas-
cinating to any patient, educated
man. Too, what original scholarly
exploration doesn't challenge?

Hilary Putman’s “A' Philoso-
pher Looks at Quantum Mechan-
ics” is one of the most clear-
headed analyses 1 have seen of

the current crisis in microphy-
sics. One indication of the need
for reasoned. discourse ‘in this
ﬁeld may be found by reading
the contradictory accounts of the
theory written by the quantum
physicists themselves.

David Hawkins revives teleo-
logy, one of the most ancient of
philosophical doctrines, with his

proposed indication of a purpose
in nature to be found in the evol-
ution of organisms seeking reduc-

tion of redundancy. Hawkins-

speaks in terms of entropy and
information theory. As if to illus-
trate the random information
loss of the Second Law of Therm-
odynamics, the book somewhere

in production loses a “bit” of in-

fomation: footnote No. 16- in
Hawkins’ article is missing from
the text. '3

“The Physics of the Large” is
Philip ‘Morrison’s involved ac-
count of an involved subject-
cosmology. It assumes a greater
proﬁciency in the physical sci-
ences than the other essays in
the volume. 1

Resigns as  Mat 

Ends Thirty-Year Career;
Remains as Gym Instructor

By BILL CABIN " '

When Rex Peery came here in 1950 there was no wrest-
ling team. He has compiled a 112-37-3 record since then,
and has developed wrestlers who have won 13 national and
22 Eastern individual titles. Peery’s resignation became

known last Monday.

Peery’s resignation becomes ef-
fective after this season, and
ends a 30 year coaching career.
He plans, however, to continue
as a physical education instructor
here.

Higher academic standards
during the past three years have
made it impossible for Peery to
maintain .a squad with depth.
Six members of the 1964 squad
did not return this season. Bill
Buchanan, Tim Gay, and Terry
Sullivan withdrew. George Rad-
man and John Carr encountered
academic difficulty. Dave Clery
transferred to another school.

Although scholastic problems
have hindered the team’s stab-
ility, Peery discounts this as a
reason for his resignation. “That
had nothing to do with my deci-
sion,” Peery said. “I’ve been
coaching wrestling for 30 years,
and that is about enough in one
sport.”

Peery had discussed resigning
with Athletic Director Frank
Carver several times _last tri-

- mester. “We had spoken about it

many times in the late fall or
early winter,” said Carver, “but
his resignation came as a sur-
prise.” '

“I’m not a bit happyiabout it,” '

said Carver. “You can't be happy
when you lose a man .who is
probably the best wrestling coach
in the country. His contributions
to wrestling at Pitt and to the

Peery’s wrestling career began
at Oklahoma State_ University
where he won three NCAA titles
in the 118-pound class. He also
won two AAU championships, an
alternate berth on the 1932 Olym-
pic squad, and reached the pin-
nacle of his career by coaching
the 1964 Olympic free-style
Wrestling team. ’

Although Peery will no longer
be formally associated with
wrestling, he will remain a part
of the sport. “l’m dedicated to

the sport, and my resignation.-_—

does not change that,” said Peery.
“I intend to stay connected with
the sport in some capacity, and
whoever replaces me, I'll help
get themon the road.”

“I’ve already made my recom- ‘

mendation for a new coach,” said
Peery. Carver, however, refused
to discuss possible successors un-
til the end of the season.

Gymnasts Anticipate
Difficult Day at State

By GEORGE LIES
Gynmastics coach Warren Neiger expects trouble tomorrow when
the Panthers travel to Penn State. The undefeated Lions are rated

by many coaches as the best in the East after defeating Springﬁeld
“because they have four top-ﬂight boys to use in the all-around
last week. A

“Jim Sacco will have his problems Saturday,” said coach Neiger,
event.” Penn State alternates among Jim Cuhane, Ed Isabelle, Steve
Cohen, .and Ed Jacobson; Neiger expects the Lions to use Cuhane.

“All four boys can perform an six events,” Neiger said. “Isabelle
will be in the high bar and the ﬂoor exercise and will deﬁnitely be
on the parallel bars.”

Undefeated Dave McKinnis‘ “will have his hands. full” with the
Lions in the side-horse event. “Specialist Roland James is frustrated,”
said Neiger, “because he loses rto.McKinnis by a few points every
time.” ‘ «
“We’re not too good this year and now we’re down to seven
men,” Neiger said. “Sacco needs more work because‘ he still doesn’t
have the experience on the high bar and now Tom Misage has a bad
shoulder.” . '

The gymnasts beat Syracuse in the side-horse and the ﬂoor exer-
cise. “If we do any scoring it wil1‘be in the side-horse and the still
rings,” said Neiger. .

Captain Misage faces stiff competition in the horizontal bar be-
cause this is Penn State’s “strongest event.” -

Dukes Swamp Cubs  
For Fourth Loss

‘ The Largest Selection of-

 

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

Rich Car1berg’s 33 points
provided the spark for Du-
quesne to swamp the Cubs,
105-75 Tuesday night at the
Civic Arena. The loss was
the fourth straight for the

, frosh, giving them a 2-4 rec-

ord. They have not found the
winning combination since De-
cember 8 when they beat Point
Park. Duquesne now sports an
eight game victory skein and an
8-1 mark for the season.

The game began with Bob
Thompson matching Duquesne

shot -for shot for the ﬁrst eight :

points. The Cubs played alert

basketball and led 15-14 when '

the Dukes’ 2-1-2 zone pressured
the frosh into crucial mistakes.

Loose balls, misguided passes

and forced shots by the Cubs en-p

abled Duquesne to outscore them
15-2 in a three minute stretch.
After that, the Dukes were never
headed; they lead at the half,
51-39.

Immediately after the inter-
mission, Carlberg dashed any

Cub hopes of getting back into n

the game by sinking nine straight
points, giving Duquesne an insur-
mountable 19 point edge.

The Dukes impressed Coach
Carl Peterson with their size,
depth and shooting ability. “We
were just outmanned,” said Pe-

terson. “Their boys could really .
shoot. They were hitting from -

everywhere on the court.”

The basketball team travels to Penn
State tomorrow in an attempt to snap a
ﬁve game losing streak. If the Panthers
lose, however, there will still be a highlight
to the trip. The Panthers will play in Rec-
reation Hall, the Nittany Lions’ new ﬁeld
house. _ -

The Lions, however, have one of their best
hoop teams in recent years and have posteda 9-3
record, which looks good. The Panthers hold a

dismal 3-7 mark. Their only common opponent is
West’ Virginia.

The Lions stopped the Mountaineers in the last
few seconds 80-79, at Morgantown, while the Pan-
thers were trounced— by the Morgantown quintet,
86-72. A last second shot by guard Bob Weiss gave

‘Penn State their victory.

In the home game last year. against Pitt, Weiss
wasn’t too impressive but this season he is the
sparkplug of the team. “We had Cal Sheffield on
Weiss last year,” said coach Bob Timmons, “and
that’s why he didn’t do much in that game.”

Hoop Team Seel:
Losing Streak at Penn State

“They have the same team back as they did 
last year, but because they have played together 
so long they are a, much better team than last

year's squad,” Timmons added.

The Panthers have had trouble with zone de- 

fense all season because of their inability to have
a consistent shooter._ “Penn State plays a zone de-
fense and they have a good one,” said Timmons.

“They also tend to fast break a lot, so we'll have I:
to play a ball control game to keep the score 

close.”

Not only the zone defenses but bringing the
ball up court against the press has been trouble-
some for the Panthers. To counteract this prob-

lem coach Timmons intends to go with. Brian". ’ :4

Fisher at one of the guard spots instead of Dave

Blyshak. Blyshak is a natural forward but had 
been playing guard to increase the team’s scoring 

potential.

Another move Timmons plans on making is
platooning Ray Doyle and Jim LaValley at center.

Track Team Hosts Kent State 1

The Panther track team opens

its indoor season tomorrow after-
noon by hosting a Kent State
team which Coach Carl Rees an-
ticipates will be stronger than
recent ones. “The past couple of
years we have beaten Kent State
by 15 or 20 points,” says Rees,
“bin-.\they are trying to go big
time in athletics and have re-
cruited some ﬁne athletes.” Com-
petition begins at 1 p.m.
. Kent has several performers
with outstanding credentials.
Marty Eisner ‘ is a former Ohio
state champ in the shot put who
has thrown the shot 54 feet in
high school.

One of Kent’s hurdles, Ron
Hughes, is a, big, strong boy who

ﬁnished second to Joe Friend in
last year's meet. Pete La Ren-
deau, who runs the mile and the
two-mile relay, ﬁnished sixth in
the NCAA cross-country competi-
tion at Michigan State.

Coach Rees feels the Panthers

will lose the 35 pound weight
throw and the shot, but will com-
pensate in the distance runs and
relays. “(Luddy) Hayden and
(Bill) DelVecchio look realy to
go right now,” said Rees.
