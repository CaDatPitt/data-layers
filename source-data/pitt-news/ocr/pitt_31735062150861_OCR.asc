Reorganization

Plans for CA

Association President
Discusses Revisions

Undergoing complete reorganiza-
tion, College association this week
will revise its constitutidh, and put
into effect ten or more proposed new
functions, including a re-arrange-
ment of cabinet and committees,
Gene Tedick, C41, president, re-
vealed Friday.

After informal approval of these
changes the College government
group will work on changes in
name, membership, dance policy,
and revision of the system of the
student loan fund. The name which
has been suggested is College Stu-
dent council.

Ofﬁcers of the association explain-
ed they want the body to act as the
official organization of the College,
with more emphasis on student gov-
ernment and uniﬁcation of students
within the College. CA officers de-
clared the new plans will be placed
before the proper school authorities
for approval.

Major constitution change that
will be made this week provides that
CA officers act as ofﬁcers of the Col-
lege (officers of the school) rather
than as officers of an organization
within the school.

Changes in physical set-up of the
organization, aiming at elimination
of overlapping jobs and replacing
dispersion of authority with some
plan of centralization, were an-
nounced by G. Richard Frankovich,
C41, vice-president, as follows:

1. Only persons eligible for nom-
inations shall be those that have
served at least one year in the cab-
inet or on a standing committee.
This means that about 30 members
of the assocation would be eligible
to hold office, and students in the
college would elect oﬂicers from
this group of “experienced associa-
tion members, Frankovich explain-
ed.

2. The cabinet be composed of
an executive committee of officers,
a representative from each class, a

, On ‘Twelfth’ N ight’

 Wednesday Morn

Discussing “The Stage History of
Shakespeare’s ‘Twelfth Night,”
Samuel Pearce, lecturer for the
Theater guild of New York city,

will speak in Foster memorial audi-
torium Wednesday morning at 9:30
o’clock.

A graduate of Yale university,
Pearce has been connected with the

Z theater for the past 10 years. Actor,

stage manager, and booking agent

j intermittently during his career, the

speaker has been associated with

the guild for the past two years.
He was heard on campus last

year, when he presented a similar

=talk on “Hamlet,” the quality of

which merited another appearance
at the University, according to Dr.
Ford E. Curtis, associate professor

" of English.

Using colored lantern slides to
describe various stage settings and
props used in the production of
“Twelfth Night,” Pearce will de-
scribe the evolutionary process

. which the staging of the play un-

derwent until it reached its present
form.

Dr. J. Perrine

To Demonstrate
Artificial Voice

A machine will mount the ros-
trum in the Foster memorial Wed-
nesday before students and faculty
members who will be dismissed
from fourth hour classes to hear it
speak.

The Voder (voice operation dem-

. onstrator) will talk about the Uni-

womy, wlaose talk‘:-was titled... ‘.‘From 

versity as its electrical impulse
“breath” vibrates its metal ‘‘vocal
chords” producing a basso profundo
or an overstimulated soprano voice
as it chooses.

Dr. J. Owen Perrine, assistant
vice-president of the American Tel-
ephone and Telegraph company,
will “introduce” the Voder, the ﬁrst
instrument of its kind in the world.

Speaking on the “Artificial Crea-
tion of Speech,” Dr. Perrine will
demonstrate the Voder, and explain
electrical apparatus which produces
the sounds and combinations of
sounds used in human speech.

A specially-trained woman, seat-
ed at a console, will operat mech-
anism and creat sounds, words,
and phrases like that of human
speech.

According to those who saw the
demonstration at the New York
Wor1d’s fair, the audience laughed
almost continually during the per-
formance. —

The Voder will produce the two
kinds of sounds used in human
speech. One kind is made by forc-
ing the breath through the mouth,
past the tongue, teeth, and lips
while shaping the mouth cavity.
This is the way the unvoiced con-
stant sounds like “s” and “h” are
made and all sounds of speech when
whispering are made. When whis-
pering all sounds of speech are
made in a similar manner.

Produced by the Voder are the
human speech sounds which come
from the vocal chords when vowels
like “a." “o,” and “u” are pro-
nounced.

The pitch of the sound produc-
tion can be varied at will, making
the ensemble to speak in a basso
profundo voice, a high pitched
voice, the shaky voice of an old
man, and it also can be made to
laugh and sing.

A Student Suggestion
For the Athletic Council

ONE OF THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE sug-
gestions offered to the University in some time
is Don Parke’s proposal to set up a student ath-
letic council supplementing the present faculty
council. _

Officially the proposal comes from Men’s
council, of which Parke is president. but there
is no question that the idea is really Parke’s.

So far, no positive action has been taken on
the plan, although it has been placed before the
faculty council for consideration. Dr. R. E.
Sherrill, chairman of the council: John Weber,
University secretary; and James Hagan, director
of athletics, have all expressed themselves as in
favor of the general principle of the plan, but
wish to reserve ﬁnal judgment until they have
had time to study it more carefully.

Up to this point, everything is in perfect
order. Nothing more could. be asked at the
present. But one danger exists: that the plan
may be considered purely in its original form.

We-say this because we do not feel that
Parke’s proposal is desirable in all respects, also
because in its present form the plan has little
chance of meeting-with. the complete approval
of the faculty council.

' It is our belief that a student athletic council
could accomplish much,  opinion shared by
several University a.dministrative officers. We
believe the consideration of such a g'rou'p should.
be thorough and slow. W say slow because as
soon as there is a premium placed on making
the ﬁnal -decision in a hurry, the plan will suffer.

Thzere are two extremes which a student ath-
letic council might possibly reach: one is the
status of a powerless, so-called “advisory” group,
which would amount to little more than another
honorary society; the other is an organization
which would degenerate into nothing more than
aifault--finding, carping bunch of malcontents.
If there is to be an athl.et.ic. council of students,
it must fall somewhere between these extremes.

It must be a group of students sincerely in-
terested in lniversity athletics, a group which
will have some real powers but wlczich will work
with the faculty council and keep friction at a
miriinitgni.

Provision for some sort of faculty check on
the group’s moves rshould be ‘.w.r.a.c3_«-_>., but it should
have enough. independence that tide members of
the council will be respected. l.»._:«' t‘:: eir fellow stu-
dents. -

Unquestionably, reaching such a goal will be
difficult. But if both the stu.cl:2nts and faculty
members interested are not willing to take time
to create a workable setup, then they should
not start work on it at all.

In the main our admonitions are probably
unnecessary; Sherrill, Hagan, ‘Weber, and Parke
are just a few of those completely willing to de-
vote their time and effort toward establishing
a satisfactory plan. '

We raise the issue only because we see so
much of value in the idea that we should hate
to see it collapse before getting a fair trial.

A Biological Indictment
Of Society’ s Restraints

(This is the second of two articles, written by
James Butcher, C43, on the contemporary situation.

The ﬁrst article was an examination of our present
institutions, pointing out that our present “philosophy
of proximity”--a restrictive basis of evaluation—is, in
a sense, inadequate; that the search for another philo-
sophy most frequently leads to religion, which fails
because Christianity does not now “embrace heerto-
geneous human interests and give them judicious ad-
ministration” and does not accept or reject new truths;
that most political ideologies are partly responsible for
present day confusion, since they pretend to offer some
change which is not really connected with a funda-
mental change in perspective.)

Each of us neglects to visualize retrospectively the
origin and motivation of those values which we deem’
so deﬁnitely a part of our culture. Such a View would
reveal these values as the implements of man, created
arbitrarily to perform a speciﬁc but equally arbitrary
function.

Restraints are devised when the preservation of a
desirable state is jeopardized. Admitting the complex-
ity of human society, one looks in vain for biological
precedent to sanction the labeling of violations as
“criminal.”

Moral Justiﬁcation

For example, the supreme penalty is invoked when
treason is committed; but from what depths of ex-
pediency does man draw forth sufﬁcient moral justiﬁ-,
cation?

I am not trying to defend offenses against organ-
ized society, as such; but is the promulgation of human
welfare so contingent upon order that we may allow
it to suppress our search for truth? In this elusive
concept “truth” are embodied channels for diverting
the energies and desires for self expression, the needs
and conﬂicting interests, into one powerful vehicle ca-
pable of their righteous and just administration.

The Enlightened Intellects

Such a vehicle may bless us with its beneﬁts in a
tangible form—yet more probably in the guise of en-
lightened intellects. Perhaps, too, enlightenment is be-
ing reserved for a more worthy organism. In any case
we are invested with no blanket acquittal of present
fumblings committed in the name of necessity.

If an individual or a group becomes so satiated with
the assurances of security embodied in the forces which
hold his way of life together, as to voluntarily cease
the quest for a cohesive ideal, then certainly he has
succumbed to superﬁciality.

Call these the sentiments of a visionary, or a tirade
against humanity’s incredible lack of vision, if you
wish. But if it has made one person realize the in-
signiﬁcance of world conﬂict and transitory despots,
it has accomplished much.

To the enumerators who insist that America has
produced the tallest buildings, safest highways, great-
est singers, and most beautiful women, we would do-
nateanother “ﬁrst.”

From the presses of this country has been vomited

forth a book which must be the supreme effort of a

depraved mental and spiritual being.

The book is Theodore Kaufman’s “Germany Must
Perish!”

No other author has so effectively bared his mind,
in this case a mind which is diseased and ugly, one
which picks at its own cankers and displays the mat-
ter therefrom for the world to see.

The W’orld Upsetters

Kaufman speaks of the Germans as world-upsetters.
He points to their warring past. He denounces them
as disturbers of the peace.

To remedy this, he proposes mass extinction of the
German peoples. Not by the clumsy expedient of mur-
der, let it be said, but by the highly humane, process
of sterilization.

They must be treated, he says, as homicidal crimi-
nals. There is no room for them on this earth, he says.
« It had been my intention to treat the book lightly,
to lash at it with ton.g_u_e of acid. I cannot.
There is no more "appeal in the presentation of the
German as the world’s scapegoat than there was when
the Jew appeared in the same role.

The Courts and Reform,

The criminal courts of this country are operated
upon one premise: that the wrongdoer must be re-
formed. Correction has taken precedence over pun-
ishment. This is a long range view; it takes into con-
sideration that the criminal, at the time of his arrest,
has taken more from the community (world) than he
has given to it. It then realizes that his removal ac-
complishes nothing more than an easy way out, where-
as a program of reform can achieve an inﬁnitely more
courageous reconstruction. We must believe this. If
we do not, then we must appeal to immediate death as
the natural end to all our pains.

I ﬁnd not the slightest suggestion of even obscure
justiﬁcation for Kaufman. His plan is too cruelly
methodical to allow of insanity.

One thing we intellectuals must protest to the world.
Kaufman does not speak for us. His lecherous prose
is of his own foul pen. He draws from nothing that is
of us, nor have we the intellectuals any reaction to his
book, save of revulsion.

Charles Camarata.

In the Mail

Editor, the Pitt News:

In February's issue of the Pitt
Panther, an article titled “Why Go
Fraternitty?” presented fraternities
to the student body in a rather
pleasant and glorious light. Stat-
ing that 18 out of every 100 Uni-
versity men and 24 out of every 100
University women were fraternity,
the article went on to state that
more than 50 per cent of the activ-
ity leaders were fraternity men,
that fraternity groups controlled
student government, and that the
bull session was one of the greatest
values in fraternity life.

Fraternity life was presented to
freshmen under the question “Why
Go Fraternity?” as the way to so-
cial as well as to political success
on campus. '
6 A Slight Gripe

.=‘.nd yet, when an association is
formed to give the non—fraternity
 and woinen the least bit of this
social  group life enjoyed by
.Iratcrn.ity members, the editor of
the Pitt Panther sees ﬁt to imply
that the main purpose is political
Instead of listing the activities and
honors (as he did with Robert
Shaw. Delta Tau Delta)" of the
members of the Independent asso-
ciation, the Panther editor, Delta
Tau Delta, chose to refer to them as
members of a political party organ-
i.r.=ed to combat organized fraterni-
ties, namely the “Old Guard.” "

Instead of presenting Jack Brady
as campus editor of the News, the
Panther editor attached the adjec-
tive, ‘party'—niinded.” Instead of
referring to Jack I-Ioeveler as ODK
man, former business manager of
the Panther, and Cap and Gown
:ta1', he is called the “best known
2.116. most hated Independent.” In-
stead of recognizing Ruggern Aldi-
sert as president of ODK, as well
as editor of the News, he mentioned
him as one of the “Old Guard” In-
dependents. Likewise, Bill McEl-
wain is not identiﬁed as president of
Pitt Players, sports editor of the
News, and present acting editor, but
as one of the “Old Guard,” with

whom the present association lead-
ers will have “nothing to do.”

0 Reﬂecting School Life

Now realizing that the editor of
the Panther may be atempting to
produce a magazine that reﬂects
accurately school life in the style
of Life and similar magazines, I feel
that to ascribe a political tag as the
main impression of the Independent
association ,and not to present it in
as fair a light as his article did the
fraternities, shows a great lack of
judgment.

Independents abhor any bitter
feeling between fraternity members
and non-fraternity students as much
as do fraternity men; it is only fair
to say that fraternity men and W0-
men generally have been very open-
minded and fair, waiting for the
members of the Independent asso-
ciation to prove their purpose. To
mention only a few, the Phi Delts,
the SAE’s, the Kappa Sig’s, the Phi
Gains, and others havebeen inter-
ested in the purpose of the associa-
tion as a desirable movement.

But, a “one-slanted” presenta-
tion of Independent association
members as that of the March is-
sue of the Panthers makes diﬁ"1-
culties.

Flash! Heaven, March 21: An
exclusive overbearing of some heav-
enly plans, designed for Earth, and
presently to be put in blueprint.

Quote: St. Lucifer is sojourning
here following his recent reinstate-
ment in the angelic heirarchy due
to his losing a competition with an
Austrian paperhanger.

St. Lucifer has been appointed to
the chairmanship of the office of
Chief Overlooker of the Second-
earthwarintwentyyears division, and,
as a result called a meeting of his
aides.

The meeting was scheduled for
Jupiter’s Pub on the ﬁrst day of
Spring, Earth Time, and was at-
tended by only one of the aides, the
minister in charge of constructing
arsenals of democracy, St. Franklin,
well known socialist and democrat.
O All-Out Frankie

St. Franklin is better known to
intimate acquaintances as All-Out
Frankie and has set up a rule that
he be quoted indirectly and without
quotation marks.

Lucifer adjourned the meeting
when he saw that there was not a
quorum present, and retired to the
back room with Frankie. They had
an angel open a bottle of Nectar,
which they drank while some
Movies of the more spectacular parts
of the Secondearthwarintwentyyears
were shown. -

Your'rep'orter was hovering near
the ceiling of the back room when
he overheard this conversation.

A regurgitation by Lucifer, fol-
lowed by an unpleasant remark
that nectar was all right in its
place, but that last bottle must
have had a loose cork.

Out of respect, Frankie regurgi-
tated. g
.0 A pres la guerre

“What’re you gonna do after the
war’s over, Frank,” asked Lucifer,
pouring himself another glass.

Frank hitched up in his chair
and said, “Tell ya what, Lucy; I
think I’m going to socialize the liv-
ing daylights out of those Teutons,
if it takes the last breath of Spring
to do it. After the war, I mean.
Right now they aren’t exactly sus-
ceptible to the notion, or to me.

“Why Frankie, I thought you was
a democrat. Yuh aren’t stealin’ on
me, are ya, Frankie?”

With a hurt look in his eyeglasses,
St. Franklin turned to him. “Why’d
ya wanna say that for, huh, Lucy?
Doggonit ya make me cry some-
times. I never‘ stole on anyone.
It’s just that this here democracy is
like men’s clothes. They got a
style, see, and they stick to it for a
longtime. Just like democracy.
There aren’t any Spring fashions in
-democracy. Ya gotta sneak up on
it. And I’m sneakin’. What I
mean!”

0 Ah, A Good One

There was a pause while another
bottle of nectar was brought in.
Lucifer tested the cork, found it
tighter. than someplace hot, and
bade the angel pour. The which
was done. .

.“Y’k-now,” Frank mused, sipping
his nectar rather more than softly,

A close-checking basketball team
from the University of Pittsburgh
almost upset the dope in the NCAA
semi-ﬁnals at Madison Saturday
night, but the University of Wiscon-
.sin‘s last half drive was too much
for the Panthers, who lost out to
the Badgers, 36-30.

The victory gave Wisconsin the
Eastern championship and put them
in the ﬁnals next Saturday against
Washington State, who tripped Ar-
kansas, 64-53.

"Sammies in Opener

Of Floor Playoffs

A closely .contested match marked
the ﬁrst of the intramural cham-
pionship playoifs as the Independ-
ents beat the Sammies, 28-28, last
Thursday. ' , '

All through the game the two
teams battled with the lead chang-
ing ﬁve times. Even at half-time,
the score was knotted, 14-14.

With Murry Mayer leading the
attack, the cream of the Greeks
seemed to have the game well in

hand at the end of the third quar-

ter, but Williams garnered enough
points in the fourth quarter to win
the game.

Topping all others for high scor-
ing honors were Williams of the
Independents with 12 points and
Mayer of the Sammies with nine;
Jones and Kuzman of the Independ-
ents and White and Coltin for the
Sammies had six points apiece.

held down, the Panthers survived a
bad ﬁrst half, and toppled Carolina
with a second half return to form.
Both Teams Off Form

Both teams were well below their
usual standards of play, and it was
sophomore Tay Malarkey’s seven
points that" ﬁnally gave Pitt their
win. The Tarheelstkept Straloski
fairly well bottled up, the Pitt
scoring ace registering only six
points. Straloski also injured his
left eyeball late in the contest, an
injury that for a time threatened
to keep him out of the Wisconsin
battle.

Pitt ﬁnally began to roll in the
second half. Straloski, Milanovich,
I5-’ort and Malarkey counted nine
points before Glamack slipped in a
long one. From 17-12 the Panthers
moved to 21-14, and although Car-
clina climbed to within three

never really in danger.

Thursda_v after'no'on, two games

Both teams were off form in the 
ﬁrst two matches of the day, but, '
in the ﬁnal contest the Amity boys,

came through like real champions.

Jack Henning was the leading
member of the Amity Club last
Thursday, for he paced his team
with thehigh score in every match.
Al Norbut, Tom Murphy, Emil De-
Leo, Frank Franchini and Henning,
made up the winning combination.

Amity Wins First

"Bert Engelsburg, captain of the
Pilams, was way below form all
afternoon, showing a 159 as his
best mark.
through nobly, but to no avail, as
he. bowled a 163 for thehigh Pilam
score of the afternoon. Completing
the fraternity champions lineup
were A1 Davidson, I-Iershey Mattes,
and Norm Feinberg.

The ﬁrst match of the day was
close with the Amity Club winning
by 26 pins; the second match was
c-'v'e;"i more thrillrlng when the Pi-
lans won by a scant margin of four
pins; the ﬁnal round was a walk-
away for the independents when
they amassed a total of 766 points.

Following their victory over Pi
Lambda Phi, the Amity Club con-
tinued along the undefeated trail
by trouncing the Industrial Engi-
neering team last Friday afternoon
in two straight matches.

The Industrial Seniors ran away
with the crown in the engineering
league, and were expected to give
the last year’s champs a stiff bat-
tle. But the Amity bowlers were
on their game, and the match ended
in a hurry.

Henning Top Man

Jack Henning continued his bril-
liant bowling by knocking over 160
pins in the ﬁrst game, and 164 in
the ﬁnal tilt. Murphy also came
through in championship style,
bowling a better than average score
of 150 for two matches.

Eight pins was the Amity Club
margin in the ﬁrst tilt, but the ﬁnal
was quite different as 133 pins sep-
arated the victors from the fast
fading engineering team.

As a result of their victories over
the Pilams and the Industrials, the
in.dependent titleholders moved
within one victory of the champion-
ship crown. I

The semi-ﬁnals will be held to-
day between the engineers and the

Quartet of Former Panther
Swimmers Enlists in Army

Independents Open Fire at Fraternity
Swim Records Tomorrow Afternoon

With an eye toward copping top
honors in the all-campus aquatic
activities, April 14, the Independ-
ents try their “water wings” in the
ﬁrst of a group of elimination meets
tomorrow afternoon in the Trees
pool.

Since the Independents have lost
only three of last year’s outstand-
ing swimmers, chances of an IA
cup in the all-campus meet are not
too remote. As usual the fraterni-
ties will be offering plenty of com-
petition, but the Independent squad,

this year, should be equal to the
task.
Notavo Triple Threat

Mosko, Jackson, and Notaro will
be the mainstays of the Independ-
ent entry. In the ﬁrst of the intra-
mural swimming championship tus-
sles held last year, the trio won
several individual titles.

Notaro was a triple threat man.
He won the 80-yard free-style race,
took second place in the diving
duels, and was a member of the
160-yard relay squad.

Jackson easily won the spring-
board championship and completed
on both of the winning relay teams.

Frank Mosko swam to ﬁrst place in
the 60-yard medley event and took
top honors in the 40-yard breast-
stroke race.

Seven Events Tomorrow

Seven events are on the competi-
tive calendar for tomorrow’s meet:
120-yard medley relay, 100-yard
free style, 40-yard backstroke, 40-
yard breaststroke, 80-yard relay,
and the diving contests. In the lat-
ter, the running front dive, back
dive, and the front jack-knife dives
are required. Then the contestant
must perform any two optional
dives.

Entries for tomorrow’s meet must
be turned into athletic director
James Potts today.

Two other preliminary meets are
scheduled before the all-campus
championship fracas. The Engi-
neers are slated for March 26 while
the Fraternity swimmers _get_ to-
gether, April 1. ' 

Thursday. Not wishing to break
up this singing-swimming quartet,
Milt Lederstein, Al Beacon, and A1
Slobodian have decided to join him.

Because they have been singing
together for the last eight years
and have been auditioned by some
of the leading bands in the country,
they will try to get into the Enter-
tainment and Recreation unit of the
army.

All four boys graduated from Pitt
last June.

New Additions to Squad
Bolster Diamond Hopes

Straloski Joins Panther Infielders;
Malloy Boosts Mound Corps Stock

Although hampered somewhat by
the weather, Coach Ralph Mitter-
ling’s baseball squad is making
rapid strides toward getting into
condition for their coming game
with the Ohio State Buckeyes.

According to Mitterling, the Pitt
baseballers are rapidly rounding in-
to shape and should put up a satis-
‘factory performance against the
State team from Columbus. The
Panthers will be taken outdoors as
soon as the weather breaks. Intra-
squad games and hitting practice
will feature the Pitt workouts when
the team is taken onto the Stadium
turf. -1 ’ , ,

Straloski Joins. Squad

Several causes for optimism have
arisen in the Panther camp within
the past few days. The biggest
cause of joy for the Pitt nine isthe
addition to the squad of second
basemen, Eddie Straloski and foot-
baller Bob Malloy. The former is
expected to make a serious bid. for
the second base job, while Malloy
is being counted upon to bolster
the shaky Pitt pitching staff.

For the ﬁrst time since the drills
began, the Panther pitching situa-
tion shows signs of holding its own

1 against collegiate competition. With

the addition to the hurling depart--
ment of Wilk, Banks, and Malloy,
the Blue and Gold will have a fairly
competent staff. V

With the opening game of the sea-
son only a matter of days away,
the Panthers seem to have most of
their problems well in hand. Both
the shortstop and ﬁrst base difﬁ-
culties are fairly well taken care of
and should be in shape for the
Buckeye game.

Shortstop Problem Solved

Two newcomers to the squad,
plus an experienced veteran are
solving the shortstop problem. At
the present time the ﬁght for the
position is between John Vaiksnor,
Williams, and Jacobs. Vaiksnor
has a slight edge because of his ex-
perience.

First base is being taken care of
satisfactorily and should present lit-
tle trouble. Here the battle lies be-
tween sophomore Johnny Brown
and Lefty Ziolkowski. Two of last
year’s ﬁrst basemen are missing

Weather Hampers
Pitt Tennis Practice

As there are only four more
weeks before the opening match
with Ohio State, all members of
last year’s tennis squad and all new
candidates are requested to see Ollie
Stiff at the Athletic ofﬁce and have
their eligibility checked as soon as
possible.

Dr. David O’Loughlin, coach of
the squad, stated that as soon as
there is a break in the weather, the
team will begin practice outdoors.

Sam Barone, manager of this
year’s squad, announces that there
will be a meeting of the entire
squad in the near future at which
time this year’s schedule will be
published.

since Ralph Fife is ineligible, and
Lefty Drobnuski has been trans-
ferred to the outﬁed.

On the whole, the Pitt nine is
practically ready for the 1941 sea-
son. Unless injuries crop up, Pitt
should have their most successful
year since the sport was revived a
few years ago.

Women Discuss
Union Proposal
For Heinisphere

Macmurray college debate team,
on an extended tour through the
eastern part of the United States,
will meet the debaters of the W0-
men’s Speech association tomorrow
evening at 8 o’clock in the Cathe-
dral. The topic for discussion will
be, “Resolved: That there should be
a permanent union between North
and South America.”

The women representing Mac-
Murray will be Virginia Allen, Bar-
bara Butler, Grace Fenne, and
Mary Ann Freeland, and they will
be opposed by Elizabeth Krowich,
C41, Helen Becker, C43, Lois
Neundorf, C43, and Helen Benovitz,
C43, in the debate which will be in
the Oregon style, with an open
forum following.

It will be the ﬁrst time in the his-
tory of the schools that they have
opposed each other in debate. The
chairman for the meeting will be
Freda J affe, C41, who will also lead
the forum. Faculty and students are
invited to attend.

According to Miss Jaffe, the Mac-
Murray debaters have a “very fine
background.” Miss Allen, as a
member of her high school debate
team, was on the national high
school debate championship team
for one year and the Illionis cham-
pionship team for three years. She
ranked high as an extemporaneous
speaker.

Barbara Butler was a member of
a high school team which ranked
high in both state and national com-
petition. Miss Fenn-e has done
most of her debating in college,
winning several college prizes. Miss
Freeland has yet to win her laurels,
being the freshman member of the
squad.

A private dinner, preceding the
debate, has been arranged to wel-
come the girls to the University.

Little ODK, Ten Cent Turtle,
Sent Here front New Orleans

Could you do it?

That is—travel from New Orleans
to Pittsburgh in an upper berth be-
sides being cooped up in a paper
bag and going without food.during
the journey? Well, Little ODK
could hardly do it, too.

Bewildered by sudden attentions,
halt‘-crazed with lack of food, and
exercise, and in a lethargic state
(Pennsylvania), Little ODK opened
his eyes, in Pittsburgh on the desk
of Robert C. Machesney, adviser to
student publications. Little ODK
is a small turtle, sent by University
ODK students to precede them on
their return from last week’s Omi-
cron Delta Kappa convention in
Louisiana. The ten-cent turtle is
their souvenir gift to Mr. Maches-
ney, apparently.

But it was half-dead. It had to
be revived quickly. Concerned over
Little ODK’s welfare, Mr. Maches-

   
 

ney took it across the hall to Mary
Lou Perring, secretary in the Uni-
versity News service ofﬁce, who
knows something about watering
house plants anyhow. Here it was
decided Little ODK needed water,
food, exercise, and a -can lid of
something to live in.

Dr. Sam Williams, biology pro-
fessor, contributed a pan, made es-

pecially for housing little turtles;
Miss Perring set out the prepared
ant eggs, etc., food which accom-
panied the turtle; somebody else
poured water in the pan. Then stu-
dents and faculty members waited
breathlessly for the little turtle to
wake up and live.

Finally the dime gift got up off
its hands and knees, poised its fore-
paws, and then dove into the water!
It pulled itself out of the water
pan and ate some food. It was
living.

during the playing of the Concerto.
His opening movement, with its ar-
peggios, had intensity and sweep,
yet the slow section had a simple-
grace and charm. The concluding
movement had a distinct Hungarian
ﬂavor, and the music is full of
hearty good cheer with enough oc-
casional wistfulness for contrast. In
this movement, there is a brilliant
work for the pianist with dazzling
octaves which achieve a climax of‘
true, Brahmsian splendor, and a
sonority not easily forgotten.

It took the peculiar emotional
temperment of Brahms to paint a
tonal picture of such vividness as.
the Symphony Number 4. The very
opening phrases draw the listener
into a moving current of music. An-
other program item was the Tragic-
Overture revealing the universal,
fundamental emotion of tragedy.

During the intermission, Harvy
Gaul auctioned off the first album
of the newly released Columbia
records of the Pittsburgh symphony
playing Wagner’s “Bacchanale.”
