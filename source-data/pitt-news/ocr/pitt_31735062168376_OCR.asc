Reasons Vary For Planned
‘Mellon - Carnegie Merger

(See D7-. Kwrtzman’s sta.tement—-
page 2 and Edz'to'r'ia.l, page 4.)
V By ALAN DISLER.

Although various reasons
have been put forward to ex-
plain the motivation behind
the planned Mellon Institute
(Ml) -"Carnegie Tech merg-
er, informed sources claimed
that the University’s new state-
relatedness played a signiﬁcant
role. A high ranking administra-
tor said that MI sought to dis-
sociate itself from a “state uni-
versity” and to escape “State
politics.” _, ,

Officially, however, the new
merger is seen to open more doors
of cooperation between the Uni-
versity and Tech-MI. Dr. Paul
Cross, president of Mellon Insti-
tute, emphasized “the very best
of cooperation which has existed
between Pitt and Mellon Insti-
tute,” and hoped that “the new
arrangement would lead to even
better relations.

Dr’. A. C. Van Dusen, Vice-chan-
cellor for the Professions, stated
that he didn’t “anticipate any set-
back” to the University as a re-
sult of the merger. He added
that “Pitt has alawys encouraged
inter - institutional relationships
when two or more institutions
could beneﬁt by it.” Dr. Van Du-
sen cited the Pittsburgh Council
on Higher Education as a trend
in this direction. .

Dr. Van Dusen attacked the
suggestion that the University’s
state-relatedness created a vacan-
cy for a private liberal arts uni-
versity in Pittsburgh. He said
that “the new state-relatedness
which the trustees and adminis-
tration worked out with commun-
ity leaders and the legislature
was of such a nature as to con-
tinue the University of Pittsburgh
as a private institution with some
state support.”

He emphasized that the added
‘state’ support was only a subsidy
on the tuition of state students,
“and that 70 per cent of the cost
of education at this University
isn’t touched by tuition dollars.”

Dr. Charles Peak, Vice-chan-
cellor for the Academic Disci-

-.

plines, did not feel that private
support for the University would
vanish. “It must always be re-
membered,” he said, “that Pitt
is a, state‘-related university; it is
not state-controlled and operated.
In reaching the decision on ‘state-
relatedness,’ the University was
assured by responsible persons
private support would continue,
that this region wants and needs
the University to be truly out-
standing. If the University is to
achieve all-around excellence it
will need substantial private con-

. tributions to further those crea-

tive program developments which
make the vital difference be-
tween being good and being ex-
cellent.” ‘

Dr. Van Dusen felt that “there
is no reason why Pitt cannot
grow into a great institution”
despite the building of another
potentially great university next
door.

Dr. Peake said that “the more
educational power and resources
this city can develop the more
this region will develop economic-
ally and culturally. To think
otherwise is to condemn the fu-
ture of this region to mediocrity
and stagnation. You have only to
note the remarkable economic
and industrial development of the
Boston area in which two major
institutions, Harvard and MIT,
played so great a role." There is
no reason why Pitt and Tech
should not play the same role
in the development of the Pitts-
burgh region.”

-Dr. Peake said of the Tech-Mel-
lon merger in general that “sci-
entists are first of all concerned
with the advancement of scienti-
ﬁc knowledge. They need to in-
terract and to cooperate. They
are not likely to let provincial at-
titudes affect their professional
interests.” ' '

State Enrollment Up

  Freshmen Board Scores Increase

By ROBERT ZAVOS

This year’s freshman class is
distinguished from‘ last year’s
class by having a higher percent-
age of Pennsylvania residents
and slightly higher college board
scores and high school class rank-
ing.

Robert L. Hannigan, associate
director of admissions, stated in
an interview with The Pitt News
that 74 per cent of the 1,460

' freshmen are Pennsylvania resi-

dents, compared with 62 per cent
of last year’s 1,602 freshmen. He
attributed the increase in Penn-
sylvania students to the fact that
there are more commuting stu-
dents than last year.

Because of a lack of dormitory
space, only 44 per cent of the
freshman class will reside in the

dormitories, while last year 70.

per cent resided in the residence
halls. “The reason for the dorm
space being less than last year

Chancellor’s .Mansion

  Sold To

Informed sources have report-
ed to The Pitt News that the
Chancellor’s Mansion on War-
wick Terrace has been sold to
the Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese.

.University officials neither con-
firmed nor denied the report.

It was also reported that the
University Police will stop guard-
ing the Mansion either this Tues-
day or Vvednesday. An official

Diocese?

announcement of the sale should
be forthcoming sometime next
week.

The Mansion has not been oc-
cupied since August, 1965, when
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld
resigned. Neither the late Acting

.'Chancellor, Dr. Stanton Craw-

ford, nor the present Acting
Chancellor, Dr. David’Kurtzman,
-ever resided in the Mansion.

the Student Government Book

is because the senior class for the
last few years has ‘been small,
while the freshman classes have
been larger,” remarked Hanni-
gan. This difference left relative-
ly few spaces in the dormitories
and many applications to the Uni-
versity were sent back for this
reason.

The main -SAT score in both
verbal and mathematical sections
for men and women was 564 for
this year’s freshman class com-

pared with 561 last year. This is .

broken down to a main verbal

score of 549 and a main math"

score of 579. Last year these fig-
ures were 550 in verbal and 571
in math. ’

“Approximately 91 per cent of
this year’s freshman class were
in the top two-ﬁfths of their high
school class compared to 89 per

cent frost lay year,” according to

Hannigan. The College Entrance
Examination Board's Manual of

‘Freshman Class Proﬁles, 1964,

listed 87 per cent as the compar-
able ﬁure for entering classes.

Approximately 63 per cent of
of the class of ’70, 59 per cent of
the class of '69, and 60 per cent
of the class of ’67 were in the
top ﬁfth of their high school
classes.

A most interesting ﬁure is the
number of ‘requests for applica-
tions for next year’s entering
class.
over 4,500 requests have already
come in, and they will be com-
ing in for the rest of this year
and much of next year. The 1,4_60
members of the class of '70 were
selected from 4,116 applications
and last year there were 4,241
applications of which 1,602 were
accepted.

THE SYRIA MOSQUE resounded with popular folk music Saturday
night, when the Back Porch Majority performed in the ﬁrst Student
Union Board concert of the academic year. Tickets for the event were

in the economy no longer 

rests with great individuals; I
but with groups and that the
“men who get ahead today are :_
those who have access to technic_-; '

al insights and. not to ﬁnancial

resources.” The contention was-.
made in a lecture that was the,

last in a series of lectures con-
cerned with

ty’s philosophy department.
This shift in power was not

viewed by Dr. Galbraith as ten-_
tirely welcome. The shift means ,
that one can no longer tell exactly 

where decisions are made. The
cause of the relocation of power,

according to Galbraith, is the
great emphasis placed on techni-"'
cal knowledge and skill in busi-‘.

ness affairs.

This concern with and inter-.f_
pretation of the role of techno,-,_.
logy in modern society is the.’
basis of the lecture series, which -
is part of a larger study on th,,.
impact of technology on Ameri-

can values. This study, headed
by Dr. Kurt Baier, chairman of

the philosophy department, seeks.
to discover how such values as.

love, family, work, privacy, and‘

individuality will be held in the *

year 2000.
Besides Galbraith, and the two

University professors, 14 other

scholars are working on the proj-

ect. The preliminary result off,
' their efforts to date is that Amer-

ica will pattern its political and

social future after Sweden, and

its cultural future after Southern‘

California. Southern California's:

general mobility and Sweden’

 

concept of nationalism will be,»

characteristics of future Ameri-._
' can society, according to a. report’

on the technology study in the-

University’s alumni magazine. ,
Dr. Rescher notes that the big

gest danger that could arise from ‘,

such a change would be imper-

“Technologica1 -
Change and American Va1ues”"f
and sponsored by the Universi-. 

 

sonality. Dr. Galbraith _ referred _‘, .9,

 

to this impersonality when men .
tioning the possible dangers, of‘

not knowing exactly who exer-
cises power. . «

The biggest advantage inher-
ent in this kind of change ‘has

been noted by Dr. Baier to be .

“the tremendous opportunity for

improvement through increased"

power over the environment-in
the life sciences, in weather- con"
trol, in the control of diseases’
and in other areas. On this topic
Dr. Galbraith expressed no opin
ion.

The other scholars participat-4*‘

ing in the lecture series included
Bertrand de J ouvenel, director of
a French research organization
Emanuel Mesthane, director of
the Program of Technology and
Society of Harvard University
Kenneth Boulding, professor of

economics at the University off.

On  Mellon -Carnegie Tech Merger

By DR. DAVID H. KtmTz1v1AN
 Acting Chancellor
I was delighted when Pres-

ident Guyford Stever of Car-

negie Tech called the other

day to inform me of the pro-
posal to create another pri-
vate university in Pitts-
burgh. Carnegie University in its
new partnership with Mellon In-
stitute will signiﬁcantly further
the cause of high quality educa-
tion. I view their proposed‘mer-
ger as another giant step toward
enhancing the ’total educational
resources of the nation.

In the aftermath of this good
news, however, some con-fusion
arose: for one thing, Pitt’s pri-
vate status as a state-related in-
stitution, and for another, Pitt’s
relationship to Mellon Institute.

Pitt is still predominately pri-
vate. The feeling in some quar-
ters seems to be that Pitt must
be one or the other—-private or
public. The facts are otherwise.
Pitt is a private state-related uni-
versity, which for years has re-
ceived state aid, and which now
has entered a partnership with
the state to see to the education-
al needs of larger numbers of her
students. _

It was precisely to preserve th-e
private nature of a strong‘ educa-
tional system that the State of
Pennsylvania engineered its state-
related concept. Traditionally,
private universities derive their
star quality from far-sighted ben-
efactors and philanthropists who

are willing to pioneer or under-

write artistic, scientiﬁc and cul-‘

tural programs" far beyond the
means of the public pocketbook.

Such programs are not built
overnight. Rather than create a

_vast new system ‘or educational

institutions —.— to duplicate the
physical plants alone would have
been enormously costly — the
state developed its staterelated
plan under which it can dis-
charge a large part of its educa-
tional responsibilties by building

on existing excellence.

The state appropriation for our
general operating budget was in-
creased, but by no means was
the increase meant to cover all of
our needs. Furthermore, the bulk
of Pitt’s increased state appropri-
ation was not additional money
for ‘Pitt. The largest portion of
it was a tuition supplement which
simply replaced money the stu-
dents would have had to" pay.
Tuition, by the way, does not
cover the cost of instruction.

“State- related,” then, is far
from being synonymous with
“state university.” Pitt receives
a signiﬁcant amount of its sup-
port from private sources. Twen-
ty-four of 36 voting members on
its board of trustees are private-
ly appointed. Private donations
will not replace the need for state
dollars but will go into a. separ-
ate account, an account which
may be examined by the state,
but which will be controlled sole-
ly by the University.

The state has made it consi-

derably easier for the private
donor, but at the same time, the

state is buying _an opportunity _

for its young people to enjoy the
advantages of an institution of

excellence which has lively and.

imaginative private participation
in its programs.

Clearly, .the private benefactor
can no longer be expected to
pick up the constantly swelling
tab for high quality education.
Without the private donor, how-
ever, academic life would be
drab indeed.

As for our cooperation with
Mellon Institute, I see no reason
why it will not continue to grow.

Years ago Mellon Institute was
a part ofthe University of Pitts-
burgh and was called the Mellon
Institute of Industrial Research
and School of Speciﬁc Industries.
That formal affiliation endedlin
.1927. Since then our relationship
has been both professional and
cordial. M

For their convenience and ours,
we have a direct telephone line
to them. Their staff members
have used our credit union and
our swimming pool and have en-
joyed our faculty tuition beneﬁts.
We have shared professors with
them.

Carnegie University will en-
hance and expand our city's al-
ready eminent position in the
ﬁeld of higher education.

‘Man for Times’
Editor, The Pitt News:
Hopefully, we live in an age of
rationality. If this is the case
then, as Linda Goldstein pro-
posed in her column, Milton
Shapp is a “Man for the Times.”
If not, however, the times will
belong to Mr. Shapp’s opponent.
For this is the difference -in the
campaigns of these men:

Mr. Shapp speaks of issues.
public assertions and literature
deal with problems facing the
people. His campaign attempts to
appeal to the public intellect. Mr.
Shafer, on the other hand, at-
tempts to _appeal to emotions that
are best classiﬁed as gung-ho mo-
ther’s soup. Shafer has posted
billboards across the state pro-
claiming, that “The Shafer’s ‘Are
Coming.” The ABC network used
that exact wording, substituting
“Batman” for “Shafer,” in their
advertising for the Batman show
last January. I assume that Mr.
Shafer is hoping that the public
will take him to their hearts as

- they did Batman. As for the pic-

ture of the Shafer family pranc-
ing across the hills of Pennsyl-
vania hand in hand, something
I’m sure they do periodicaly, I
trust that it is just a preiminary
for other pictures of Shafer and
his crew eating blintzes, dancing
at a Polish wedding, and having
dinner with Martin Luther King.
Shafer aims for the public emo-
tion.

I believe that the voters of

Pennsylvania will prove that Mi1- »

ton Shapp is a man of the times.
If Shapp loses, however, it is the

times that will demand our sym- ’

pathy and not Mr. Shapp.

Couple Attack

Pitt News Review
Editor, The Pitt News:

After reading Charles Reiner’s
review of A Man and a Woman,
(Pitt News, Sept. 16), we found
it as least sad that he took this
beautiful ﬁlm, briskly original,
a clear and effectively compas-

sionate portrayal of a persuasion,

to fully love, hardly more than
“great soap opera.” If that is
soap oprea, what does Mr. Reiner
feel is a better ﬁlm about love?
And although he praises the tech-
nique and direction of the ﬁlm,
he misses the point of the matter,
viz. that the style was expressly
subordinated to directly and‘,
carefully revealing this experi-
ence of love; not only the photo-
graphy but the composition and
the improvizational acting were
noteworthily successful in this.

As an experience A Man and , --

a Woman was more than wonder-
ful—we were made to feel new.
At the risk of being bold, we
were offended by the review and
request you print this letter for
the beneﬁt of those persons who
might unwittingly be turned away
from the ﬁlm because ‘of Mr.
Reiner’s unfair judgment. We un-
ashamedly praise the ﬁlm, the
whole ﬁlm, and urge people to

see it—-to let their hearts see,. I

learn, and be pleased.

 . LOS ANGELES — It was
_‘5Saturday night around 7 :30
p.m. The sun was slowly set-
-ting over the mountain peaks
.}_which rim the sprawling city of
Los Angeles. The Coliseum, a
vmlammoth structure that shelters

. for the Panthers’ debut. Just how

awesome only the imagination

, seum, some ‘sophomores were

‘-_ -ment. But the talk among the
‘ ilveterans was encouraging. They
"were up for the game-. There
[were going to be a lot of sur-
gprises. At least, that’s what they
.3 were saying before the game.

 
  
  
 

 
 

   
 

In’ preparation for the season,
‘' Coach Dave Hart had placed his
—_best players on the defensive

‘igan had been tabbed as a pos-
sible All-American. Greg Keller

- sive spots, were supposed to be
two of the strongest and most
_ aggressive players on the squad.

BOB LONGO, split end, set a new Panther record in the 57-14 rout
by UCLA with 11 receptions for 155 yards. The offense might pull
out the future yet.

By far the most dejected per- ‘

son on the ﬁeld was Hart. Never

before in his football career had .

he been associated with the likes
of a 57-14 loss. If a grown man
were allowed to cry, Hart just
might have. -

For some reason no matter
how bad you think a team might
be, you’re always hoping for that
miracle team. Like the one which
played for»Navy‘ in 1954 and only
had two men weighing over 189
pounds. The team which every-
body felt sorry for that year
went to the Sugar Bowl with only
two losses.’

UCLA proved that the Pan-
thers will be no miracle team this
year and Hart has placed the
blame completely on his own
shoulders.

“The only person to be blamed
is myself. We came here unpre-
pared. I gauged it wrong. I eased
up too much in the last week of
practice. If the score had gone to
70 points, I wouldn’t have mind-

‘just lip service. It's gotta come

been a nightmare. At times there

 

it Freezes in

 

ed, if only we had been hitting.

Hart learned a few lessons,
however, and he also gained a
little bit of wisdom. The only way
an individual can get psyched up
is as individual. According to
Hart, “They said they were up
and I believed them. But you
can't talk about being up-—that’s

from here, the heart.”

The three hours previous to
this conversation with Hart had

didn’t seem like there were more
than four or ﬁve Panthers de-
fenders on the ﬁeld.

Gary Beban, Mel Farr and
company were turning the ends
with no opposition. If a play
went to the right side of the ﬁeld,
the linebackers were lying on
the 1eft_side.

When Farr ran around his
left end eights. yards for the, sec-
ond touchdown of the night, he
broke successive tackles of Bobby

Dyer, Mickey Depp and Flanigan.

After a point the score was
merely relative. Things just didn’t
seem to be any diiferent than
last year. But then you remem-
ber hearing Flanigan talking
about the 35 different defenses
they have set up for this year
and you wonder if maybe there.
are too many. ‘

On one defensive play, Hart

called for an 86. Out on the ﬁeld ‘

they argued among themselves
whether an 86 was really meant
or an 84. “Maybe there was too
much for them to learn,” said
Hart. “On an obvious blitz, they

/ just seemed to stand there and
think.”

If it's possible to have any
bright spots in a 57-14 loss, there
were. And the brightest was the
offense. The unit which was sup-
posed to be the patsy gained 319
net yards.

—Dewey Chester was running on
nervous energy. Joe Jones and
Mike Raklewicz hurt Protho’s
Bruins up the middle and Protho
admitted it. Eddie James proved
himself, completing 15 of 22 pass-
es. Mike Elliott came in the

fourth quarter to complete three
of four.

 

Eleven of these passes went to
Bob Longo, who set a new Pitt
record for the number of recep-
tions in one game. The offensive
line provided James with all the
time he needed.

Coach Tommy Protho said that
it looks like another long season
for Pittsburgh. Hart promised a
lot of changes. The Panthers are
down in the dumps right now.
And as Hart said, “Brother, we
need help.”

Beat Frostburg, 4-O

By MIKE BEEURMAN

Last year, according to
soccer captain Art Richards
son, it took the team four
games to jell. This year, the boot-
ers jelled after’ the ﬁrst 10 min-
utes of their opener with Frost-
burg.

It took only these few minutes
for the players to get their of-
fense into high gear. When they

(N. ’ did, the outcome was never in
doubt;The booters came prepared
to play.

The seniors were ready, as
coach Leo Bemis knew they
would be. “These upperclassmen
really want to play, they have
great desire,” he said. This was
evident in theyplay of fullbacks
‘Richardson and Jim Snyder, who
turned away every Frostburg
threat. .

It was also apparent in the
play of halfback Al Traunsteiner,
who -seemed to be everywhere
the ball was. And, it was evident
in left wing Sal Tavares, who

_ simply outran, outfaked, and out-
<'~ hustled his defenders all after-
noon.

The juniors were ready too.
Especially rover Pete Snyder,
who scored‘two goals, and, ac-
cording to Bemis, “played a bril-
liant game. He really came into
his own out there today. All the
juniors played well. They had
much more conﬁdence_ than a
year ago, and improved 100 per
cent.” '

Before the game, Bemis doubt-
ed whether his sophomores were
ready, but these doubts were

ll‘ " gone by the end of the ﬁrst per-
iod. They might have disappear-
ed when soph Sheldon Zvoma
dribbled through half of the
Frostburg team, then slid a pass to
soph Ernest Mouen who prompt-
ly converted the ﬁrst goal.

Or, they might have disappear-
ed because of the play of sopho-
more halfback Dave Shimpeno,
who consistently broke up Frost-
burg attacks before they could
get started. They certainly must

_-.. have been gone by the time Zvo-
 ma. tallied the booters third goal.
Pete Snyder, who had scored
only a few minutes before Zvo-
ma, ﬁnished up the scoring in_ the
ﬁnal period with his second tally.
. By that time everyone at the
game was aware that they were
seeing a good soccer team.
Good? Yes. Good enough? The
Frostburg game didn’t tell. The
next two Weeks will. In them,
the booters meet two of the coun-
try’s top teams, West Chester and
Michigan State. The booters feel
they are-ready.

Girl Amazes
Yogi Experts

There is joy in Holland Hall
today. Kay Shenesky, senior as-
sistant, picked 11 of 14 Saturday
football games to give the girls
the early lead in the Yogi con-
test.

She lost only the UCLA affair,
Duke’s win over WVU, and Cali-
fornia’s upset of Washington St.
(which none of the participants
foresaw), and Miss Shenesky cor-
rectly tabbed USC’s triumph over
Texas.

George “Moustachio” Lies, Fred
“Blood and Guts”' Frank, and
player Jim Flanigan had 10-4 rec-
ords. Coach Dick Bestwick had
nine winners.

What about Tom “Alabama”
Sacks and Jay “Flatbush” Rosen-
stein? Both are in hiding after
barely salvaging 7-7 slates. But

both sent word out that nobody

will stop them next week. “It was
a ﬂuke,” said one of Flatbush’s
aides.
