Melissa Smith resigns from Sdent Government Board

By Pete Kapustynski
Asst. News Editor

Student Government Board President
Gil Golden announcedthe resignation
of board member Melissa Smith at an
SGB meeting on Friday.

According to Smith, her decision to
resign was prompted by the recent con-
troversy surrounding the granting of
scholarships to presidents of student

groups.

“Although I have been considering
this for some time, the issue that led me
to announce my resignation was the
decision to give a full scholarship to the
board president,” Smith said in a letter
sent to SGB.

“Please understand, this is not an
attack on the current Student
Government Board president,” Smith’s
letter said.

Also in the letter to SGB, Smith said,
“For quite some time now, I have felt
stifled in my efforts to represent stu-

‘ dents, which is the essential purpose of

the board. I felt that because I was con-
sidered to be [the] dissenting voice,
often, instead of being able to express
my opinion freely, I was silenced.”

SGB President Gil Golden said be dis-
agreed and pointed to Friday’s SGB
agenda sheet where it said “open floor.”

“Our board meetings have always
been open. We’ve alwaysbgencouialged
open discussions on any issue,” Golden
said.

Golden said despite Smith’s resigna-
tion, he believes SGB will continue to
be an effective force on campus.

ing includes: . .

petition
against
SGB perk

By Beth Kovaly
Staﬂ‘ Writer

In front of a banner bearing
the.slogan ‘Break the Golden
rule,’ students were asked to
sign a petition protesting the
recently-passed presidential
scholarship plan.

“Do you agree with the
Student Government Board’s

decision to« rei:mb-ur-se ~ th«e~~

-tuition: of its president with the
Student Activities fee?” Erin
Bush, member of the
Committee to Rally Against
Presidential Perks, asked stu-
dents as they passed by the
William Pitt Union Thursday
afternoon. .

- The presidential scholarship
will provide the current and
future Student Government
Board presidents with full-time
undergraduate tuition. Half of
the money will come from the
Student Activities fee, the rest
from the Office of Student
Affairs.

Bush, also a member of
Pittsburgh Students Peace
Coalition, said that most stu-
dents did not know this was
happening.

“What we’re trying to do is
get this put on the ballot of the
next Student Government Board
election so it goes to referen-
dum. [SGB] decided this among
themselves without getting any
student feeling at all. It’s kind of
like Congress voting themselves
a pay raise,” Bush said.

Nathan Miller, co—chair for
Presidential Perks, said the
committee, which was formed
within the last two weeks, is a
one-issue coalition with support
from many‘ of the political
groups on campus.

Miller, who is also a member
of BiGALA , stressed the lack of
student input in the decision.

“It seems like the decision
was made by the student gov-
ernment members near the end
of the summer when the stu-
dents weren’t around, and it

O'Conner gets raise

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor received an $11,000
raise from the Board of Trustees for the 1992-3 school year.

The raise was given after deliberation and thorough
review by the Board of Trustees’ compensation committee,
according to committee Chair Farrell Rubenstein.

“Why do most people get raises? Because they do a good
job,” Rubenstein said.

O’Connor received a 5.5 percent compensation increase
over last year, which brings his 1992-93 salary to $211,000.

Rubenstein said that there are many reasons for the raise.

The chancellor’s salary was below the average for the
American Association of University Presidents but is now
approaching the median. .

O’Connor had a significant learning curve in a short time
frame when he first came to Pitt last year, according to
Rubenstein. He restructured business and Finance, and he
reversed the budget process. Instead of a “from top to bot-

LCB hunts for underage
student drinkers at Pitt

Byjohn Temple
Staﬂ Writer

P:m‘y—goers at Pitt are likely
to find undercover Liquor
Control Enforcement agents in
their midst as a state-wide
crackdown on under-age
drinkers goes into effect.

According to a letter sent
from Director of the Bureau of
Liquor Control Enforcement,
William A. Mericle, to Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
in late August, the BLCE is
"undertaking a totally new pro-
gram in the interdiction of alco-
hol abuse on and near college
rumpuses.”

The aggressive new tactics

have thus far resulted in a
sweep two weeks ago by'BLCE
agents and city police in
Oakland and surrounding
areas. The raids netted 43
arrests, mostly for under-age
drinking but also illegal selling
of alcohol. -

“We’re not going to go out
there to drum up something
that doesn’t exist, but [illegal
drinking] is there and we’re
going to act on it,” Corporal
Kenneth Jones, the BLCE dis-
trict commander, said.

THE PIT1‘ NEWS, Monday, September 28, 1992

I'_SkydiVing For Dollars" promotes fundraising

By Leon Fuksman
Staff Writer

Pitt Rotaract Club wanted to make sure
that Habitat For Humanities continued
building homes for low—income families,
so they decided to sponsor a unique fund-
raising event.

Saturday afternoon skydiver Tim Petalino
concluded the “Skydiving For Dollars”
fund—raising contest by jumping 5,600 feet
onto a field of plates in Schenley Park. The
first plate that Petalino touched as he land-
ed determined the $1,000 contest winner.

“It was nice and clear up there, and I
couldn’t be happier,” Petalino, a ground
school instructor for USAir, said. “I had a
lot of fun, and I’m glad this benefited a
great cause.” ,

The event raised $2,000.

Local professors and business owners
purchased 110 plates each costing $20
from the Rotaract Club, a student orga-
nized community service group. The pur-
chase was to assist Habitat For Humanity
volunteers in constructing four new houses
for families with financial difficulties.

“When someone falls out of the sky, it
catches the attention of the community,
and that is why we were here,” Pitt sopho-
more Mike Yost, a member of Rotaract,

said.

The Rotaract Club at Pitt was founded
last year by the Rotary Club, an interna-
tional organization comprised of local
business leaders who promote community
projects. ,

“Groups like Rotaract make us work,”
Steve Hellner-Burris, executive director of
Pittsburgh Habitat For Humanity, said. “It’s
nice to see young college kids take a part
in something that makes a difference. This
shows that they care about other people.”

Hellner-Burris said his organization
erected 14 houses during its. six-year exis-
tence in Pittsburgh and currently enlists
about 1,000 volunteers, mostly from
church groups and area colleges.
Internationally, the group has been build-
ing houses in 55 countries and 650
American and Canadian cities and towns
since 1984.

“We have families — moms, dads and

even kids — helping us, and this is a good .

way for them to get together and do some-
thing of worth-lasting value,” he said.

Hel1ner—Burris considered his group
unique because it offers no interest on the
housing loans. It also requires needy fami-
lies to persistently be a part of the labor
force and devote 350 hours volunteering in
other housing projects.

  

“We build our houses with volunteer
labor for $35,000 while typically these
houses cost between $65,000 and $70,000,”
he said.

Mary Francis McLaughlin, a full—time vol-
unteer staff member for Habitat For
Humanity, said she appreciated the
Rotaract Club for endorsing the fund—rais—
er.

“It was great what they did. Any college
experience should have a service compo-
nent to it,” she said. “Students who get
involved in community projects learn true
aspects of life.”

, Pitt sophomore Tony Moody, president
of Rotaract Club, spent four months orga-

_ nizing “Skydiving For Dollars.” He said he

originated the idea for the donation from
his own interest in skydiving. “We needed
something that would catch the public’s
eye,” he said.

Suman Basuroy, an Indian student at
Katz Graduate Business School, is one of

40 Rotaract Club members. He learned '

about the group from his ex-landlord.

“I haven’t done much community work
in the United States, and this was a good
opportunity,” he said. “Many foreign stu-
dents don’t have much of a chance to help
out people in the community, and having
done this was very rewarding."

A Look out Bush and Clinton,

THE-.PI'IT NEWS, Monday, September -28, 1992

By Frank Porco T
For The Pitt News

Pitt students are going to have
their student loans and their bar tabs
forgiven if the newest presidential
candidate gets elected.

Dan Crawley, star of one of the
Pittsburgh Brewery’s fantasy commer-
cials announced his candidacy for
president of the United States two
weeks ago. He made a stop at Pitt as
part of his campaign tour.

Crawley, the Beer Party’s candidate ‘

for president, has been visiting local
bars and taverns gathering up votes
in his last minute effort to get On the
ballot.

“I thought it was my duty as an

American, a Pittsburgher and a beer
drinker, not necessarily in that order,
to run. It’s a tough job, but some-
body has to do it,” Crawley said.

In order to promote the campaign,
Pittsburgh Brewing has started
its Own beer-truck caravan tour
called the “Wet Your Whistle”. stop
tour.

The “Wet Your Whistle” stop tour
visits local bars, restaurants and tav-
erns, buying the house a round and
winning over votes.

“We’re essentially buying Our Votes
to win this campaign, but that’s notl1—
ing new really, the important differ-
ence about the way we buy our
votes is that we use brewery dollars
instead Of tax dollars,” Crawley said.

According to Crawley, the other
candidates are not emphasizing
importantissues such as local econo-
my and the fact that these issues can
be easily solved with beer.

The Beer Party l1as proposed an
economic plan to save the country
and promote local beer. Promoting
local beer would increase its
popularity, and they could begin to
export it bringing money into the
country.

If a tax were placed on all import-
ed beer then the national deficit
would be paid off, Crawley said.

Crawley said he has challenged
Clinton and Bush to a presidential
debate, but they have yet to respond
to the challenge.

here comes Dan Crawle

According to Crawley, the other
candidates are afraid to face him
because he has all the answers -—
they are simple — and he would
beat them at a chug—off. His next
goal is to get on the balldt in
Pennsylvania and then on the ballot
in every state.

The grass-roots campaign, sparked
by Dan’s popular beer truck commer-
cial, is sponsored by Pittsburgh
Brewing Company. a

“This campaign is’ going to target
all the local beer drinkers and the
local beer they drink,” Crawley said.

Quite confident of winning the
election, Dan has predicted that the
local beer drinkers would propel him
to the Oval Office by a landslide.

University Democrats get Read then
ready for the grand finale

By Brett Gilman
Perspective Editor

Election 1992 is closing down
and the University’ Democrats
are gearing up for the home
stretch.

Approximately 40 members
met in the William Pitt Union,
where they discussed what had

to be done to help their local,‘

state and national candidates
win in November.

President Shawn McLearn
started off the informal meeting
by highlighting some of the
University Democrats’ most
recent accomplishments.

Most notable of their accom-
plishments, according to
McLearn, is the voter registra-
tion drive which he saysiis
“going very well.” The
University Democrats estimate
that, thus far on the Pitt cam-
pus, Democrats out-number
both Republicans and
Independents combined at a
ratio of 2-1, based On the voter
registration drive results. -

But McLearn stressed the fact

that these numbers mean Very"

little if people don’t get out and
exercise their right to vote.
“[The ratio Of democrats ‘to
republicans] is not worth a
damn if you don’t get out there
and pull the lever,” McLearn
said.

The meeting included guest-
speaker Professor Ted Windt Of
theCommunications
Department at Pitt. Windt, who

' the

teaches a course in Presidential
Rhetoric, spoke to the
University Democrats “as a
nOn—partisan” and was there to
provide insight into the respec-
tive campaigns Of Bill Clinton
and George Bush. He said that
between now and election day
he will give 33 speeches, and
that the University Democrats
were one of only a few parti-
san groups with whom he

would speak to during that.

time span.

Windt, who has worked on
50 political races around the
country -for
explained why, from ABC poll
data, Clinton is 21 points ahead
of Bush in the polls. He point-
ed to several problems that
Bush has with the public,
among them the public percep-
tions that “Bush cares very little
about people like me,” and‘ that
“He has a lack of ideas.”
Alternatively, Windt pointed to
successes of Clinton
because people feel that he can
relate the best to their needs.

Windt explained that one Of
the reasons Clinton seems to be
popular with college students is

the fact that he has been able ’
to reach them through various

mediums such as television talk
shows and MTV. He said that
voting patterns begin the first
time you register, so, by reach-
ing out to young voters Clinton
will develop a strong base. con-
stituency for both himself and

his party.

apartment, said that an undercover agent had
infiltrated his party the Friday night of the BLCE
sweep. His roommate, Bill Segarra, said he rec-
ognized the agent from a previous bust.

“I had seen the guy before,” Segarra said. “He
had the same long hair and was even wearing
the same cap.” The roommates asked the man
for identification, and then he busted the party.
Druckenmiller, who is 20 years old, said he was
the only underage person at the party of approx-
imately 20 people.

Two doors down the street on the same night,
BLCE agents may have been mixing with anoth-
er party of approximately 150 people. Bryan
Perun, who lives in the apartment where, he
said, regular Friday night parties are held, said
that someone came running over from the other
bust and told them that the BLCE was there.

“We looked around and saw two older guys
that nobody knew,” Perun said. “They looked
like they were in their ‘30s. They really stood
out.”

Perun said that after he asked the two men for
identification, the men argued for awhile and
then left the apartment. Perun said that he and
his roommates kicked everyone out and neither
of the suspected agents returned. He added that
he saw a fraternity party being raided later that
night.

Jones said that his agents typically operate this
way —— first penetrating a party and observing
violations before identifying themselves as BLCE
officers. He said his officers sometimes have
trouble getting into parties but, “Where there’s a
will there’s a way.” .

Although neither Dawson Street party was ask-

ing for ID, some parties ask at the door for Pitt
IDs in order to single out BLCE agents, accord-
ing to Jones. “The kids aren’t stupid; they card
not for age but for college students,” he said.

According to Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs
William Harmon, Pitt denied a BLCE request
made in the August letter to supply its agents
with university IDs so that they could gain
access to parties.

But Jones said that the BLCE is considering
other ways to get into parties, including
enrolling its agents at Pitt in order to receive

valid IDs. He would not say whether or not this 

has already been done. _ '

The BLCE learns of parties in a number of
ways. “We find out by complaints from a neigh-
bor, complaints from the police, ﬂyers that are
sent out by the person who is holding the party
or just by cruising the area,” Jones said.

A neighbor of the Dawson Street party—goers
said that the BLCE is more effective than the city
police at quelling loud, disturbing parties. “When
you call the police, they just stop by and ask
them to quiet down,” he said.

All colleges and universities throughout the-

state were requested this fall to supply BLCE
agents with IDs, according to Harmon. Many,
including Slippery Rock, Duquesne and Temple
Universities, have not acted on the request, but
at least one institution, Shippensburg University,
has.

According to President Anthony Ceddia,
Shippensburg has always worked closely with
the BLCE and this has created a good relation-
ship between the students and the BLCE. On this
basis, he has decided to go along with the ID
plan.

seems sneaky,” Miller said.

Bush said that two other stu-
dent governments were offered
the same tuition reimbursement
money but have turned it
down.

* ,CGS’s student government
voted to accept six undergradu-
ate credit hours from Student
Affairs, but voted against the six
credits that would be paid for
from Student Activities fees.

The Graduate and
Professional Student Association
have used the scholarship
money for office staffing.

CGS junior Tracey Edwards
said she agreed withthe peti-
tion because .“[Goldenl made a

choice to be.S.GB president...

That is a choice, that is not a
job.” '

Many students did not
oppose the plan itself, but the
fact that students were not
involved in the decision-making
process.

CAS senior Roy Luckett, who
signed the petition, said, “I’m
under the impression that it was
done without any student ‘OK’
but based on the people on the
board. I’d like to have a say in
whether I’m going to allow
someone to give my money
away.”

Another CAS student, junior
Robert Holzbach, said he was
skeptical that the plan would
improve the quality of SGB
presidential candidates. S; G B
President Gil Golden said he
felt that the Presidential Perks

committee had not taken the
time to find out all of the facts
before beginning the protest.

“This has nothing to do with
me. They never took the time
to find that out,” Golden said.
“This is an administrative policy.
It would have gone through
anyway. We had the vote [in
SGB] because we had to come
to terms in our own group.”

Golden said the plan was not
voted on over the summer, but
during the first two weeks of
school at the SGB’s open-to-
public meetings. The vote itself,
he said, was on Sept. 11.

The decision, according to
Golden, was made after the
administration looked at a num-
ber of other schools and univer-
sities and what their policies
were over ﬁnancial support for
SGB presidents.

He said the Office of Student
Affairs also looked at how other
leaders of Pitt organizations. are
compensated.

“We have detailed paper-
work, the entire justification, in
three offices in the William Pitt
Union,” Golden said. “1 pleaded
with people to come talk to me
about this or talk to our advi-
sors. Not one person [from the
committee] has come to talk to
me.”

Differences between CAS
undergraduate students and
graduate level students were
also a factor in the decision,
according to Golden.

“We’re on a different level.
We are the traditional college

students. They are not. Their
organizations are not designed
to work in the same capacity.

“We are full time —- nine-to-
ﬁve and beyond. We go far and
beyond because the needs of
our students are far more,” he
said. 5

Golden cited time restraints as
another crucial factor.
Belonging to SGB while carry-
ing a full—time student status,
which the board requires, great-
ly limits the possibility for a full-
or part—time job.

Golden said he hopes that the
plan will enable more students
to run for SGB president and
bring around more competition
for th¢-0fﬁC..¢-2.... 4. . -

Hesaid Pitt may have lost
some of its best leadership
because under_r_vr:iduate students
cannot handle the time commit-
ment of SGB; instead they turn
to jobs or other organizations.

“If they’re in it for the money,

the students are going to see.

that. I don’t think Pitt students
are going to be fooled,” Golden
said.

Golden said he expected stu-
dents to be concerned about
the issue.

“I, of all people, encourage
student participation. What I
don’t approve of is wrong,
unfair accusations born out of

ignorance.” _
“I’m willing to take the criti-
cism,” Golden said.

“Somebody’s going to do it 
me or the next president. I felt
like I could do it.”

Encouraging diversity

Two weeks ago cultures from all over the globe
met and shared ideas with the university community.
There were food fairs, dances, music and national
dress highlighting the diversity which makes Pitt a
world-class institution.

But diversity is much more than just those things. It
is a chance for people from all over the world to get
together and share their ideas and dreams.

But to work to understand different cultures takes

more than three short days — it takes more than a
year, and it certainly takes more than a tour of the
Cathedral of Learning’s nationality rooms.

The Pitt campus must make diversity a goal
throughout the year and refrain from calling itself a

‘ ' campus Eommitted to multicultural understanding if it

is not willing to work hard to achieve that goal.

Chancellor O’Connor has proven to be a valuable
ally in this never—ending quest towards cultural diver-
sity. He was highly visible at the international fair,
and his reception for international students shows
that he is a man committed to encouraging interac-
tion. Furthermore, the university offers a wide range
of courses. One can study Swahili, take East-Asian
philosophy, or learn about the impact of the
Holocaust. .

Pitt even has MBA schools in Czechoslovakia and
Hungary. And it has scholarship money available and
offers. credits for those students who want to‘ study
abroad.

As the voice of the university community, we also
realize that it is our duty to help. It is our goal at The
Pitt News to strive for a culturally diverse staff, but
we realize that this goal sounds shallow. What we
want is for” all members of the university community
to have a part in being the voice of the university.

This is not aselﬂess goal. The more members of
the community that are active on the paper, the easi-

-T er the jobs that we collectively hold’ will become.

And we hold these positions for only a year.

This newspaper is not only the voice for the stu-
dents, it is also a classroom. The Pitt News is a news-
paperlthat is accessible to all students with all types
of journalistic backgrounds, even those who have no
experience at all. -T .

We need the members of the university community
to act with us. The Pitt News, is the university medi-
um which serves as the campus voice. We encourage

9 membersufrom all facets of the university community

to come and write for news, sports, perspective or
entertainment. , '

It is impossible for this campus to become increas-
ingly diverse without your help. If you don’t get
involved, we all lose.

Welcome to banned parenthood

As the leading profiteer from
abortion, Planned Parenthood
(P.P.) performs an average of
90,000 abortions annually,
while referring an additional
160,000. They are targeting the
bodies and pocketbooks of the
women of our generation while
holding back many of the med-
ical facts concerning the effects
of abortion on the mother’s

body and child. Lise Fortier,

M.D., the medical director of
Planned Parenthood of Los
Angeles, stated “Indeed, if one
were to push logic to an
extreme, since abortion is so
much safer than childbirth from
a strict medical standpoint,
every pregnancy should be
aborted.” _

This blatant lie is paying off
for Planned Parenthood. In
1988 alone, its income totaled
over $303 million.

Margaret Sanger, founder of
Planned Parenthood, was an
avowed racist. As an ardent
eugenicist, "she believed in
“cleaning up the human gene
pool” by getting rid of the
poor, the Jews, Eastern
Europeans and blacks; all of
whom she referred to as
“human weeds.” She realized
the best way to carry this out
would be to put clinics in
minority neighborhoods -—— pre-
venting minority children from
being born in the first place.

In 1939 Sanger said “We do
not want the word to get out
that we want to exterminate the
Negro population.” She put
together what she called the
Negro Project for white south-
ern politicians who were con-

cerned about the high -propor—~

tion of black births.‘ One of her
associates, Clarence Gamble,
wrote, “There is a great danger
we will fail because they will
think it a plan for extermina-
tion.” His solution was simple
— “Let’s appear to let the col-
ored run it.” Sanger wrote back
saying “We do not want word
to get out that we want to
exterminate the Negro popula-

rt.‘ -

tion and the [black] minister is
the man who can straighten out
that idea if it even occurs to
any of their more rebellious
members.” Planned Parenthood
hired black ministers to travel
the South preaching birth con-
trol because Sanger believed
.“Eugenics without birth control
seems to me a house built
upon sand.”

Although Sanger died in the

Joel
  Garrett

‘60s an alcoholic and drug

addict, she would be thrilled to ‘

see that her outrageous goals
did not die with her. They are
being systematically carried out

today. Recent P.P. President‘

Faye Wattleton said, “I am
proud to be walking in the
footsteps of Margaret Sanger.”
Today, 70 percent of Planned
Parenthood’s clinics are located
in predominantly black or
Hispanic neighborhoods. Fifty-
three percent of all abortions in
America are performed on
black or Hispanic women.

Through abortion, birth control

and sterilization, a massive sec-
tor of American women are

- being systematically manipulat-

ed by the population-control
gurus into silently giving up
their motherhood.

Some black leaders are fight-
ing back. In 1987 a group of
black ministers in Chicago filed
suit against the Chicago Board

“of Education over Planned
Parenthood’s school—based clin-
ics. -

~ The suit stated that ‘these

clinics were a “calculated, per-
nicious effort to destroy the
very fabric of family life” and

that these clinics were
“designed to control the black
population.” In New

Dimensions magazine, Dr.
Mildred Jefferson, the first
black graduate of Harvard
Medical School and current
general surgeon at the Boston

h¢1.aiQ<:~.v- .-.-«-~_——-..«..-u.4-......‘_...- -

University Medical Center,
believes Planned Parenthood’s
goals to be “class warfare
against the poor. If you think
you have problems because
you are a member of a minority
group, how does anyone help
you by helping you become
fewer?” .

Planned Parenthood never
quits. In several state legisla-
tures, Planned Parenthood is
fighting “Right to Know” bills,
which require all abortion clin-
ics and crisis pregnancy centers
to inform women about all
aspects of -abortion — includ-
ing -how it physically damages

the woman’s body and psyche 9

and how it tears her cl1il“d’s
body to shreds. (Planned
Parenthood refers tglltlie child
as a blob of tissue.) Planned
Parenthood would not want to
inform women of all the facts.
According to Dr. Jack Wilke of
the National Right to Life
Committee, statistics show that
when informed, women will
choose not to abort 80 percent
of the time. This would destroy
Planned Parenthood financially.
Planned Parenthood lobbies
for U.S. foreign aid to the
United Nations Fund for
Populations Activities, which
supports the forced-abortion
policy of Communist China
while its government is coerc-
ing millions of women at the
end of a bayonet to abort their
second child. _
While hiding behind their
legitimate gynecological ser-
vices, Planned Parenthood’s
racial rhetoric has today been
replaced with such phrases as

,4

“health and family planning.” ' 

However, its policies remain
the same. This organization
advertises in our newspaper.
It’s time we do the right thing
by denying them the pleasure
of hunting down our campus
women. It’s timeiwe keep
those ads out of our paper.

Joel Garrett -is the President of
Students for Life.

A new political party says sometimes its easy being green

As we totter on the brink of the 21st
century, an endless stream of issues
bombard our political force fields.
Some issues, like abortion, envelop us
completely and demand that we exer-
cise our freedom of choice. Others, like
the environmental issue, sneak by,
slinking quietly off to the side with the
help of big business and certain politi-
cians who wish ‘to keep the general
public uninformed of environmental
abuses.

With another presidential election
ahead, the American public is once
again threatened with a loss of individ-

uality and rationale. Just as the media‘

spoonfeeds us questions to ask, politi-
cians and “specialists” extend wel1—for-
mulated yet useless answers that lend
no solution and don’t exhibit decisive
direction.

This is a time of confusion and con-
cern — a time which demands that we,
as the next generation of leaders, pose
such questions as “What can be done
about the environment?” and “How can
we, as a nation of free thinkers, work
to_stop the hypocrisy which flows from
Washington?” '

We must think in terms of survival;
not only for the immediate condition of
our environment or the domestic‘decay
of this nation but for the global issues
which threaten us all. Politicians from
every era have let us down, injecting us
with a hope for tomorrow but hollow

promises for the day after.

There is, however, a light which
shines through these mists of confu-
sion. The Green Party, which’ sprung
from the shores of Europe in the 1970s,
has taken a critical look at the crippled
condition of our global society and its

the same time it recognizes that in cur-
rent context, greed is the most effective
way to mobilize people. It is greed, in
its purity and innocence, that has gone
beyond any simple expression by the
individual and has instead manifested
itself into a type of growing world reli-

ﬂoundering values. Bringing the tradi- gion.

tions and dogmas of a myriad of groups Armed with this theoretical frame-
together; V work, the
Socialists,  Green Party has
Capitalists, embraced the
Buddhists  possibility of
and atheists " exterminating

alike, the party initially encouraged
heated discourse to weed through
cooperation. ,
Through the meshing of the party’s
diverse minds, the Green Party has dis-

covered that solutions to globalprob— .

lems cannot be achieved‘ if we ignore
the link between every living being
(even though we are increasingly losing
our touch). Green values seek to
explore the roots of our contemporary
degeneration by examining the effects
that every system; biological, industrial,
religious and political, has upon the
other. I

‘ The Green myth may actually be seen
as a reformulation of the socialist hope
— tackling such easy issues as the
widening discrepancies between rich
and poor with the intention of finding a
comfortable lifestyle for all that can
both be sustained and developed. At

effects of an escalating ecological crisis
with promises to rapidly deplete the
Earth of her finite natural resources. By
integrating the wisdom of Socialism
with the effectiveness of Capitalism, it
proffers revolutionary solutions which
involve the reorganization around the
principle of ecological sustainment. In

short, it brings us back to the land,

back to the basic values which have
been lost in the excitement of industri-
alization and a frenzied sense of tech-
nological idolatry.

Most importantly, Green Party poli-
tics have forced every major world
party to acknowledge the fact that ecol-
ogy is now a central political issue. We
are currently faced with the terrifying
prospect of environmental degradation
— an issue which will assuredly stimu-
late politics to redefine and realign on a
sweeping scale.

It is the objective of the Green Party,
then, to form an enlightened green
political bloc which transcends all party
boundaries and welcomes ecologically
concerned individuals from all existing
political groupings.

In this age of covert military opera— »

tions and largely ineffective arms nego-
tiations, does it not stand to reason that
as a people we should be seeking a
greater freedom -— freedom from cer-
tain destruction.

A truly free society must guarantee
economic, social and individual human
rights which can only be attained
through the use of a newly defined
power. Green politfcs encourages the
pursuit of this new type of power; in
discovering our strength and the con-
cept of the power of nonviolence rather
than being the passive recipients of
power exercised by others.

The empty rhetoric of 20th-centuiy
politics has proven itself of little worth.
In one of his more human moments,
however, Ronald Reagan stated that
“We have within ourselves the power
to remake the world.” It is how we
choose to use this power that will
determine the future of our threatened
existence. The doctrine of the Green
Party has laid the groundwork, we have
but to widen the path.

Presidential IQ matters

In “Quayle is Really Dove in Disguise” (Sept. 16, 1992),
the author tries to persuade his readers that Dan Quayle is a
tremendous man.

I will answer the author’s question of “when does a high
IQ become a requirement of holding public office?” I hope
the answer _would be always. If something ever did happen

_ to George Bush, this man of limited intelligence would be
running our nation. Shouldn’t we judge any candidate on
IQ and intelligence? I will concede that Dan Quayle may
have been very smart to join the National Guard to evade
the draft, butask Bill Clinton if hypocrites need to be intelli-
gent.

‘   Letters

The author also says that Dan Quayle should not be per-

son of Al Gore’s wealthy background with Dan Quayle’s is
ridiculous. I resent being told that Al Gore’s father “was a
Senator who had more money than God.” How much
money does God have? Before or after taxes? For being the
self-proclairned party of God, the Republicans have much to
learn. I believe with this kind of quote, God would be will-
ing to come over to the Democratic camp.

This article kept me laughing, but I always laugh when I
think of Dan Quayle.

Let_'s work with police, not against. them

, I.am writing this letter in response to the editorial
“Thought Police” (Sept. 21). While I agree, that the officers
accused of brutality should be dealt a just punishment, I dis-
agree with your bashing of police across the country.

Being born and raised in New York, I have come across a
few brutal and corrupt police officers. However, there are
over 2,700 cops in the New York Police Department, and
the overwhelming majority of them are hard-working men
and women. «

You also claim “nothing is being done about” police bru-
tality. In response to the Rodney King beating, there certain-
ly was something being done about it. A police chief
resigned and the officers involved in the beating stood trial.

It is about time that we stop trashing police officers. They
have a very tough job with very low pay and we, as citi-
zens, should work with them, not against them.

secuted for his wealthy upbringing. True, but the compari- »

European unity needed for growth

The recent vote by the
French concerning the future
of the European continent
brings to mind two interrelat-
ed occurrences. December
1991 marked two of the most
important events of the past
20 years — if not the last cen-
tury. On one hand was the
vote for independence in the
Ukraine, which officially

brought an end to the Soviet-

Union, and on the other hand
was the European Community
Summit in Maastricht -— a
symbol that Western Europe
was willing to put historical
hatreds and national interests
aside and make Europeans
feel united in :1 way they
never thought possible.

Both events signified the
beginning of a new day. The
ominous cloud which covered
Eastern Europc finally shined
through with a glimmer of
sunlight and hope. Equally as
important — Western Europe

was to fimll-_c rid itself of the
image as a second-rate world
player.

The Maastricht Treaty was
truly seen as a revolutionary

landmark —— both in terms of ,

economic and political impli-
cations.

The 12-member European
trading bloc agreed to create
an’ economic and monetary
union with a common foreign
policy that would ensure
European stability and pros-
perity into the 21st century.
And it ..Was estimated by the
European Community that a
single currency, rather than 11
different ones, would increase
productivity by 5 percent,
help to lower inflation, lower
the cost of consumer goods
and save businesses within
the community $13 billion a

year in foreign exchangi-

costs. —

With all of the benefits
Maastricht could bring, one
wonders why it would be so
difficult to get it passed. The
answer is simple — the
French were, in reality, not
voting on the treaty. They
voted on two huge concerns
which permeate the minds of
most Europ_eans: (1) the threat
against national interests and
the loss of sovereignty of
member—states, and (2) the
fear of a European continent
dominated by Germany. As
history shows, these two con-

Brett if
, Gilman

cerns are not unfounded, but
if allowed to manifest them-
selves, could prove to have
serious consequences.

There are those Thatcherites
who argue that a smaller and
less bureaucratized EC is nec-
essary for nations to retain
their sovereignty. On a conti-
nent where, historically speak-
ing, hostility seems to be
more the rule than the excep-
tion, this is a misconception.

A smaller European
Community would once again

find a way to erect barriers .

and old hostilities without
check. Was the community to
become less involved bureau-
cratically then surely Germany
would dominate the continent
even more. Only by binding
these nations together politi-
cally and economically can
Europe prosper as a whole.
The EC’s foundations were
built upon its predecessor, the
European Coal and Steel
Community, founded in 1951.
Established on economic

grounds the ECSC provided-

for the removal of customs
duties, quotas, etc. and creat-
ed a common market in these
goods. Every participating
nation (Germany, France, Italy
and the Benelux countries)
would have equal access to
these products regardless of
where they were located.

But most importantly, the
raw materials that the French
were given access to — iron,
steel and coal — were the
three basic components of the
German war effort.

By binding the Germans
economically, the French and
the other five participating
nations were assuring them-

selves — whether real or per-

ceived — against further_ mili-
tary aggression by their neigh-
bors. Only then were France
and Germany capable of pro-
gressing individually; only
then was Europe capable of
progressing as a whole.

National sovereignty pre-
sumes security. Can a nation
truly be sovereign when it is
constantly threatened by hos-
tility and aggression? The only
thing it can do is fall back on
itself. Ask the people of
Serbia. Of the former Soviet
Union. Of pre-World War II
Europe. _

The French and the rest of
Europe should look at history
and the foundations they laid
down for themselves. There is
very little doubt as to who
will economically dominate
Europe. But the security and
sovereignty nations depends
upon the elimination » of

‘ nationalism in its xenophobic

form. Both history and the
present prove it.

Back on track
Pitt rac/es up 5 96 total in 41-33 2/ictty

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

Two straight losses brought
criticism raining down on the
Pitt football team.

A loss to Rutgers, a team
Coach Paul Hackett said they
never dreamed of losing to,
brought questions about the
head coach’s future.

“I am not going to panic,”
Hackett said. 3

Panic or not, something
brought out an emotional side
of Hackett and his team mem-
bers as they came out ﬂying in
a 41-33 victory against

‘Minnesota Saturday night, and

it was enough.

The team came out running
and waving towels, "and
Hackett ran up and down the
sidelines. The emotion showed
on the field too.

The Panther offense explod-
ed for 31 points in the first half
and rolled up 386 yards of total
offense and seemed to put the
game away.

“We have a chance offensive-
ly to control football games,”
Hackett said. “We haven’t done
it until the first half tonight.”

Hackett credited his coaching
staff with preparing‘ the team.
Facing a team that entered the
game with an eight-game los-
ing streak probably did not
hurt. That ties Maryland, Pitt’s
next opponent, for the longest
losing streak in Division I-A
football.

Still, it was that team that
came back with 27 points in
the second half to make the
game competitive.

That, wasnot the case early.
After coming out running in its

previous contest, the Pitt
offense took to the air early
against Minnesota. Alex Van
Pelt sliced up the Gopher
defense, completing five of six
passes on the drive for 79
yards. Chris Bouyer caught
three of those passes, including
the 12-yard touchdown for a 7-
0 Panther lead.

After the defense stopped the
first Minnesota possession, Pitt
took over on its own 12. The
Panthers began an 88-yard, 15-
play drive in which they mixed
the running of Tim Colicchio
and Jermaine Williams and
more pinpoint passing by Van
Pelt. V

The Panthers converted two
third downs on the drive,
including a 15-yard reception
by Bouyer at the third-and-two
at the Gopher 28. Pitt convert-
ed seven of 11 third downs in
the game. Two runs by

Colicchio took the ball to the .

one. Bobby Boykin took a
pitch arou_nd the left side for
the score on his first college
cany. .

“Tonight we knew we could
run the football, so we came
out throwing,” Hackett said.

Hackett explained that run-
ning early might give an oppo-
nent time to adjust. The plan
enabled Pitt to charge out to
the lead.

Minnesota tried to charge
back on its next possession.
The team moved to the Panther
11 with a good mix of Marquel
Fleetwood’s passing and the
running of Mark Smith. But on
third-and-one, Smith fumbled.
He was able to fall on the ball
to retain possession, but the
Gophers failed to garner any

Renewed enthusiasm keys Pitt win

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staff Writer

During back—to—back embarrassments to lesser
eastern powers West Virginia and Rutgers, the
Pitt football team had the look of a team set on
packing it in. It was ﬂat, uninspired and just

plain emotionless.

But something happened
on the way to a 1-11 season.

A team known more for its
showboating and choking
antics played with enthusi-
asm and fire and won a
game it was supposed to
win. .

Of all the factors involved

in Pitt’s 41-33 pasting of Minnesota last
Saturday —— the accuracy of quarterback Alex

‘ Van Pelt, the excitement of wideout Dietrich
Jells, the ineptitude of the cellar—dwelling
Golden Gophers -— none proved more valuable
than the factor previously unknown to Paul
Hackett-coached Panther teams. Emotion.

Pumped—up towel waving. Coaches embrac-

ing players. Sprinting on and off the field
between halves. Contagious and rampant

Panthers’ enthusiasm.

All this at Pitt? For a game at least.

maturity

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Staff Writer

The fact that Dietrich
Jells burned Minnesota
for two long touch-
downs is not surprising.

It’s how he scored
those touchdowns that
pumped up Pitt head
coach Paul Hackett.

“There’s a maturing
process going on that I
saw tonight,” Hackett
said. “He came around
that corner [on a
reverse] — this is not
the guy that showed up
from Erie. This is the
Dietrich Jells of the
future at the University
of Pittsburgh who’s

oned with. And I think
that was what was
exciting  By the time
he’s been here four»
years  wow.” “

Saturday night’s 41-33
Pitt victory was yet
another big step in the
maturation process of
Jells. Four receptions
for 136 yards and two
scores. Both were of -
the spectacular catch-
and-run variety, not the

lot of emotion.’
Pitt copped that emotion for the better part of
60 minutes against the Golden Gophers and
were rewarded for its determination. The veter-
an players on the team provided the power
source of that electric atmosphere on the side-
lines, according to Coach Hackett who credits
them with pulling the team from the doldrums
of the past two weeks.
“We went through two difficult weeks,”

Mounties
top Rugby
Club 7-5

Stephen Liss
Staff Writer

A controversial scoring
drive by the West
Virginia’s Rugby Team
helped the Mountaineers
defeat the Panthers 7-5. It
was a bitter defeat for the
Panther Rugby Football
Club (PRFC) as it opened
its season.

The play happened
early in the second half.
With PRFC leading 5-0,
the ball was awarded to
WVU on a throw—in just
five meters away from
the Panthers try—line.
Originally the line judge
ruled the ball was kicked
out of bounds by WVU
which would have given
the Panthers possession.
However, the referee
overruled the call giving
the Mountaineers their
only real scoring oppor-
tunity of the game.

WVU took advantage
of the apparent missed
call when one of the
Mountaineer players
pulled in the toss from
the sideline and dumped
it off to a team-
mate streaking across the
field.

Two Panther players
tackled the Mountaineer
forward just as he‘ was

‘ crossing the try-line.The
play was worth’ five
points for WVU,~and their
conversion kick was
_ good making the score 7-
5. ~
PRFC had several
chances to regain the
lead. On three occasions
they moved the ball
inside WVU’s 22—meter
line but were thwarted
by mistakes. Each time
the Panthers threatened,
they lost the attacking
. advantage by accidently
bobbling the ball for-
ward. In rugby this is
called a knock—on, and

Pitt soccer continues Big East dominance
Panthers slam‘ out Villomova 1-Ofor sixth consecutive win

By Bennett Zamoff
For the Pitt News

If the Pitt soccer team keeps
it up it may soon forget how it
feels to lose.

Scott Alexander scored his
second goal of the season with
17 minutes remaining yesterday
shutting out Villanova 1-0, at
Pitt ‘Stadium. This win gave the
Panthers their fifth straight win
and improved their record in
the Big East to a sterling 4-0.

Since not winning a single
Big East game all of last year
and being ‘picked to finish last
in the preseason coaches’ poll,
the Panthers are now on fire
and sending shockwaves
throughout the college soccer
world.

The first half of play yester-
day wasa chippy, scoreless
affair with both Pitt and

Villanova taking their time at-

the start of the game to get
their offenses generated.

Playing on a humid day that
felt more like August than late
September and on turf still wet
from overnight rains, neither
Pitt nor Villanova was able to
take control of play.

Pitt head coach Joe
Luxbacher said he felt the heat
was definitely a factor in caus-
ing the Panthers’ problems at
the outset of the game.

“It was extremely humid out
there,” Luxbacher said. “The

heat comes down and just radi-
ates back up at you off that
turf. I guarantee you it’s hotter
down there on that field than it
is up in the stands.”

Despite the heat and the
Panthers’ difficulty in getting
their wheels spinning, Pitt did
manage to put together a cou-
ple of first-half rushes on
Wildcat netminder Aleko
Zeppos.

The Panthers’ best chance for
a goal came with 16:07 remain-
ing in the half, courtesy of the
man who would eventually
give the Panthers the win.

Scott Alexander sent a head-
er, off a centering pass from
junior midfielder Eric Duffy,
hurling toward the right side of
the Villanova goal. The senior
forward’s shot sailed wide to
the left, though, and Pitt saw its
best chance of getting a first-
half goal fizzle in the hot
September sun.

About three minutes after the
Panthers’ failed attempt at light-
ing up the scoreboard,
Villanova saw an even better
chance at putting one in the
net go by the boards, thanks to
a rare Panther defensive mis-
cue. '

With 10 minutes remaining in
the half, Pitt midfielder Todd
Graf tried to clear the ball from
just in front of the Panther goal.
Graf miskicked the ball, and
instead of sending it up the

field and out of trouble, he put
it on the leg of Pitt goalkeeper
Adam Spitzer.

The ball bounced off of
Spitzer’s leg, and for a couple
of seconds was right in front of
an empty Panther net. A Pitt
defender was able to get there
in time, however, and clear
away Villanova’s chance at
scoring.

In the second half, the
Panthers came out and played
the kind of soccer that has
been their trademark this year
and put together a slew of
offensive rushes.

Their persistence finally paid
off with 16:54 to go in the
game when Alexander found
the net and Pitt found its fifth
straight victory.

Alexander’s goal was the

result of a Wildcat miscue that

Graf redeemed himself on —
and in brilliant fashion.

With Graf and Alexander
applying pressure deep in the
Villanova zone, the Wildcat
defense failed to clear. Graf
pounced on the loose ball and
decoyed the ‘Nova goalie into
thinking he would take the
shot himself.

Instead, he passed to
Alexander, who fired a low
shot into the left corner past
Zeppos to give the Panthers all
the offense they would need.

“Todd beat his man,”
Alexander said. “He created the

goal by faking like he was
gonna take [the shot]. He
passed it to me and the goalie
just committed.”

The Panthers got an excellent
chance to pad that lead with
3:06 remaining in the game,
when Pitt midfielder Eric Prex
was awarded a penalty shot for
being hauled down in front of
the Villanova goal.

Prex took a pass near mid-
field to start the play and raced
in towards the net, ahead of
the Wildcat defense.

He dribbled in towards the
goal and got ready to shoot but
was tripped up just before he
could pull the trigger. .

Zeppos, Villanova’s first—yea
goalie from Wyomissing, Pa,
would not be foiled. He dove
low to his right to knock away
Prex’s shot.

The ball bounced out to
Panther midfielder Ted
Noethling, but his blistering
rebound attempt sailed wide of
the goal.

The missed opportunity
didn’t matter for the Panthers
— who went on to preserve
the lead in the final three min-
utes and bring home Big East
win number four.

Pitt gets a couple of days to
savor its shutout but returns to
action at Pitt Stadium
Wednesday night when they
entertain the Red Flash of St.
Francis at 7:15.

it was linebacker Russ Heath,
who returned it to the Pitt 20.
Fleetwood found John Lewis in
the end zone two plays later
for the touchdown to bring
Minnesota within 11 points.

Two third-down plays keyed
the next Panther drive. On one
third—and-ten at their own 20,
Van Pelt completed a pass to
Davis for 21 yards. Later in the
drive, Pitt failed to convert a
third-and-one at the Gopher 29,
but a personal foul call kept
the drive alive.

After the game, Minnesota
Coach Jim Wacker criticized the
call but refused to blame the
officials for his team’s loss.

“[I] made more mistakes than
the referees,” Wacker said.

Conley culminated the drive
with a 36-yard field goal to
make the score 34-19.

Pitt slammed the door with
just over six minutes left in the
game as Van, Pelt hit Jells on
another slant and the explosive
sophomore broke out of a pack
of would-be tacklers and into
the end zone for a 49-yard
score.

Fleetwood was able to drive
his team for two late touch-
downs, but that only made the
score close as Pitt held on for a
41-33 win.

Fleetwood completed 35' of
56 passes for 346 yards and
two touchdowns, much of that
coming after the game had

thus far. He also carried 16
yards. on a reverse and
returned a kickoff for 24
yards. All this is part of Jells’
development and Hackett’s

efforts to involve him more ,

in the offense.

“Obviously the things he
can do with the football are
magnificent,” Hackett said.
“The look in his eyes when
he came around the corner
on that reverse was a look I
have not seen in two years.
We’re seeing a guy that’s
_really come alive. He’s
worked his rear-end off. I
think we’ve found a real
force in this offense for quite
some time.” .

Jells stepped onto the Pitt
Stadium turf last season as a
speedster, a renowned
sprinter who possessed
frightening potential. Early
on he demonstrated flashes,
but just as often would drop
passes. Hackett has chosen
to simplify things as much as
possible for Jells, and the
past two weeks have shown
the transform-ation of Jells
from big—play specialist to
complete receiver.

“I’m gonna be conserva-
tive. I’m gonna go.slowly,”
Hackett said. “The man is an
immense talent, but he is a
sophomore, a true sopho-
more .. there’s a lot of
things we’re gonna ask him
to do and a lot ?of things

we’re not gonna ask him to
do at this point  We’ve
never had this kind of sud-
denness on our football
team.

“It’s just a matter of time
with Dietrich. I probably
have been a little cautious as
a coach and taken it a little
slow with him because I just
want to be sure that we get
the basics down. And I think
we’re getting there.”

Against Rutgers, Jells set
two Pitt records. Amassing
184 yards on eight recep-
tions, he broke Dwight
Collins’ mark for most receiv-
ing yards in a game. In addi-
tion, the '91-yard touchdown

connection with Alex Van‘

Pelt accounted for the
longest pass play in school
history. ,

He followed that up with
Saturday’s monster game,
giving him season totals of
16 receptions, 427 yards and
three touchdowns. That aver-
ages out to 26.7 yards per
reception. During his first
year, Jells top performance
was a 100-yard day against
Penn State. Now he has shat-
tered the century mark for
two consecutive games.

“I had no idea,” Jells said
of the back-to—back games.
“It feels pretty good. I just
try to go out there and be
consistent to help the foot-
ball team.”

“When he came around the

corner on that reverse, I’m
telling you what, he’s a dif-
ferent guy than he was two
weeks ago,” Hackett said.

From the opening series
Saturday, Van Pelt involved
Jells into the flow. The entire
Panther passing attack bene-
fited from Van Pelt’s up-field
approach. In the past, Pitt
came out throwing short
dumps to the tight ends and
running backs, and while
those were still a factor here,
it was the deeper routes that
really clicked.

Van Pelt’s first attempt of
the night went 20 yards to
Jells. In the next play, Van
Pelt drilled a quick sideline
pass to Jells for nine yards.
The tone was set.

After Minnesota capitalized

on a Panther fumble for a
field goal that made it 14-'3
Pitt, Jells took his game to
another level. On third down
and one from Pitt’s 42, Van
Pelt hit Jells crisply on a
short hitch pattern and Jells
broke a tackle and burst
down the sideline for 58
yards and a touchdown. This
came just after Jells returned
to the field with a sprained
ankle.

“It was a little slant—in. He
missed a tackle, and I tried
to take it to the outside and I
did,” Jells said.

With Pitt up 34-19' in the
game’s waning moments,
Jells‘ broke loose on a slant

pattern, busting a tackle at
the 40-yard line and showing
great determination and
strength to break another
tackle at the 30 before blaz-
ing the distance of 49 yards.
Minnesota’s cornerbacks
lined up tight to the line of
scrimmage against Jells,
something that allowed him
to open it up.

“For me — I just live for
that,” he said. “One—on—one
coverage, that’s when you
can prove what you’re about.
It’s just you against that DB
to see who’s better that day.”

Jells said he feels extreme-
ly confident and credited Van
Pelt for showing faith in his
ability to contribute.

- “My confidence in myself
has improved, and the quar-
terback’s confidence in
myself has improved,” Jells
said. “Last year I was just a

rookie, and every time I got .

into the game I was like ‘I
have to make this play.’ Now
I’m more relaxed.”

Strength is another asset
Jells has added to his game
— evident in the troubles the
Gopher tacklers found.

“I’ve been in the weight
room quite often. For me to
become a better receiver I
have to become stronger,”
Jells said. “I have to become
more complete. The touch-
downs I scored today — they
weren’t on deep balls, they
were on slants.”

half. After applying con-
stant pressure, they ﬁnal-
ly broke the try—line
when inside center
Pel Braschoss high

stepped his wayinto the ;

t1y—zone.

The play was a result _

of tenacious work by the

Panther forwards to get‘

the ball into Braschoss’
hands. ,

Unfortunately,
Braschoss’ conversion did
not clear the crossbar
and PRFC had -to settle
for just five points for the
try.

Later in the first half,
PRFC missed another
chance to strengthen its
lead. It was awarded" a
penalty kick from about
30 meters away.

Penalty kicks are worth
three points, and a kick
from that distance is con-
sidered by most colle-
giate players to be pretty
long. The Panthers
missed it.

PRFC won eight of
nine collegiate matches
last year. It will go for its
first win of this season
Saturday when it hosts
Indiana University of Pa.
The game will be played
at 12:30 p.m. at Pitt’s
Greensburg campus.

gled, placing only two in the top 10 ﬁnishers.
Senior Carmela Mariani, an All-American in the
10,000 meter run, led the Pitt squad with a
second-place finish and a time of 18:49.
Melanie Ishman, a first—year student at Pitt,
placed sixth.

“The ladies’ team is young and rebuilding,”
Lear said. “I’m very happy with‘Mariana’s run-
ning and the placement of first-year-student
Melanie Ishman.
improvement by all of our runners.”

Lear expressed some concern about having
less than two weeks to prepare for the Notre
Dame Invitational on Oct. 2, saying his teams
have along way to go. He expects a strong
showing from the men’s team. ‘

"“Our goal is to finish in the top three or
four, and we still have a lot of work to do to if

course, which will mean a big difference from
Schenley, so we have to prepare for that.‘ We
have a lot of good runners who I know can
make very strong finishes at this level.”

Gallagher

Continued from page 8-

changing the whole mode.

“They are the ones that con-
trol the emotion, the pulse of
this football team,” he said.
“We’ve got a lot of young guys
making big plays, but the
seniors are the ones that
everyone looks up to.”

While the seniors provided
the leadership, the second-
year head coach did more than
his part in adding to the
enthusiasm that animated the
Pitt bench. After Dietrich Jells’
second touchdown of the
game — a .49-yard catch-and-
sprint through the Golden
Gophers’ defense -- Hackett
evoked images of former Pitt
coach Mike Gottfried against
Penn State by sprinting the
sidelines and giving the
sophomore receiver a monster
bearhug. When he wasn’t hug-
ging deserving players, he was
encouraging others. ‘

It was a previou_sly—unseen
and long-overdue display of
energy. It was also unbeliev-
ably necessary, especially for
the recently-under-the-gun
Hackett. The last two weeks
have been particularly rough
for Hackett —— who has seen

' more shots hurled his way

than Tom Barrasso. And that’s
without the services of The
Pittsburgh Press and Post-
Gazette sharpshooters.

In Hackett’s regime, the

Panthers have never respond-

-ed well to adversity. After

starts of 2-0 and 5-0 in his first
two seasons, the Panthers
have historicallycrashed to
end the season — nosediving
to 1-7-1 and 1-5 ﬁnishes,
respectively. With Saturday’s
win stopping a two—game skid,
Hackett feels his team has
learned a great deal about
how to stop such slides -
especially with the caliber of
opponents Pitt plays in the
coming weeks.

“There can’t be ups and
downs,” Hackett said. “The
people we play are too good.
We’re in for a hornet’s nest
here. This game is a great les-
son to us.”

Whether his team will
remember this Minnesota les-
son remains to be seen -
especially with depression-
inducing opposition in Notre
Dame, Syracuse and Penn
State on the horizon. But the
fact that this team even
showed an ounce of zest and
fire is something to be encour-
aged by in a year where a .500
season may be a success story.

It’s amazing what “a strong
feeling on behalf of a cause”
will do for the welfare of a
seemingly lethargic and under-
achieving football team and its
embattled head coach.

If only they had copped this
attitude three weeks ago.

Pirates

. Continued from page 8
4-0 game. ‘

The Mets’ runs came on
Eddie Murray’s RBI single in
the sixth and Todd Hundley’s
run—scoring groundout in the
ninth.

Inside the locker room,
champagne corks left dents

_ in the ceiling while players

and coaches celebrated their
division title. Some players
took the time to toast their
former teams.

“Thank you Cleveland
Indians” sang Jay Bell, Alex
Cole and Dave Clark, while
rookie Tim Wakefield doused

‘them with

champagne.
Danny Cox and Jackson
blasted open their bottles
amidst cries of “Thank you
Cubbies for sending us here!”

The Pirates will finish off
the season with a three-game
series in Chicago, an off—day
on Thursday and then on to
New York to close it out with
the Mets.

The first game of the
National League
Championship Series will be
Tuesday Oct. 6 at the home
park of the National League
