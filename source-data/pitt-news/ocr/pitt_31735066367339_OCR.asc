Almost 8000 Students Must

Still Register for Winter Term

By JOEL FILNER
With one week left for registration for the winter tri-
mester, only 4,360 students have completed registering in all
the schools. Some 8,000 students remain to be registered by
the deadline day next Wednesday. \

those students registering after the deadline. According to
Richard C. Hodges, director of theO

needs for his major will enable
the departments to plan ahead.
“Normally the departments are
concerned that the students re-
ceive the courses essential for
graduation, but the student must
provide information that is a
check,” he said.

The major source of checkpoints
is the proposed schedule for the
following terms acquired through

Interfraternity Council will meet tonight to decide what
system of rushing will be used at the University. The coun-

different systems of rushing

which could be adapted for useat the University.

immediate rushing, has been

used since the organization of the University’s fraternity

number of defects in immediate
rushing have been discovered.

One of the basic arguments
against this type of rushing is that ‘
freshman are not given sufficient,’
time to make the transition froml
high school life to the demands of
the University under the acceler-
ated trimester schedule.

Opposition Offeled

On the other hand, some feel
that freshman who do not pledge
immediately would be deprived of
the positive adaptive influences of
the fraternities.

Delayed rushing. the second
suggested system, would favor.
a summer rushing program sim-
ilar to one employed this year
or a quiet period.

A quiet period would prevent
fraternity men from making any
contacts with prospective rushees
except at school on a non-fratern-
ity basis.

Program Shortened

Since rushing is delayed, the
pledging program would be short-
ened, and there-would be no bid-
ding after the end of formal rush.

Another system, deferred bid-
ding, would set up rushing for
freshman during the first tri-
mester with pledging taking
place at the beginning of the
second trimester. 0

The basic difference of this sys-
tem from deferred rushing is that
informal rushing would be held
throughout the first trimester or
any part of it.

Upperclassmen Accepted

However, upperclassmen may or
may not pledge during the first
semester. It was also suggested
that students should have a grade

Swartzbaugh Recommends Action

By BUD O’MALLEY

The raison d’etre of the student
Senate was discussed at length at
Monday’s meeting of the student
executive committee.

“What are the duties of a stu-
dent Senate?” asked Dr. William
Swartzbaugh, dean of students.
“What are its responsibilities and
how effective has it been in dis-
charging them?

“It seems, he said, that it has
been more concerned lately with
affairs of lesser importance to the
student body, pencil sales at the
student desk for example, than
with major University problems.”

Dr. Swartzbaugh recommend-
ed that the student Senate be-
come more active and inﬂuential
G in all areas of university life.
“This. cannot be done though in
one two-hour meeting per week,”
he said. ,“Fifte_en to 20» hours per

Senate Role Questioned

student government operation."

In other comments, Chuck Isler,
president of the executive com-
mittee, contended that the Senate
has been concerned too greatly
with jurisdictional disputes.

He said, “The Senate should op-
erate as a coordinating group or a
irecommending body with a great«
amount of potential . pressure to
exert."

Leon Gevavdan, executive
committee member, said that
the Senate has not acted enough
on matters brought to its atten-
tion. “Act now, give opinions,
and worry about jurisdiction
later.” he advised.

Executive committee member
and public relations representative
of student government, Fred Whit-
tier, disclosed at the meeting that
he is preparing a report explain-
ing studenti-government, its func-

Final Standing
On Evaluation‘

Collies in April

The evaluators‘ report of the
University will be received some-
=time during the month of April,
according to Dr. Stanton C. Craw-
ford, dean of Faculty and Admin-
istration.

The 63 evaluators, who visited
the University last week, are
members of the Commission on
institutions of Higher Education,
[Middle States Association of Col-
i leges and Secondary Schools. Their
judgment of the Universit__v’s per-
formance will be expressed in
terms of an accreditation.

Dr. Crawford said. “The visitors
seemed to get a good impression
of what they found here. Some-
times they praised the attain-
ment of goals that we had set,‘
sometimes they recognized that
the full attainment of these goals
rested with the future.

“These are the whole new setiof
goals that we have set up in our
quest for excellence,” Crawford ex-
plained. Recommendations made
following the last evaluation in
1952 were completed within three
years of the accreditation.

Included in the evaluation was
inspection of th e professional
schools. Nationwide professional
accrediting agencies cooperated
with the regional agencies, in this
evaluation.

Only 0a few members of the
group were assigned to the stu-
dent affairs area, others were
concerned with
equipment, buildings, housing
facilities and other facets of the
University campus.

“The visitors who spoke with
the students, faculty members and
administrators,” Crawford said,
“liked the general enthusiasm and
alertness they found among them.”
The group was headed by Ed-
ward _K. Cratsley, vice-president
of Swarthmore College. The other
members of the group were from
over 60 universities and profes-
sional agencies. —

Varied Collection of Loanab e Discs

0 0 O

Donated by William and Sidney Stark
By CHRIS LUNDBERG

Perhaps the most unusual and most overlooked library
in the University is the library of spoken records in the
Alldred Room on the sixth ﬂoor C1. This collection of 794
records has been donated to the University over a period of
years by William and Sidney Stark.

A large percentage of the collection consists of English

and foreign language records, in-G

cluding all of the languages oiTer-
ed here at the University.

Mrs. Dice, librarian in the All-
dred Room commented, “Foreign
students are especially taking ad-
vantage of our library of spoken
records. A few listen to English
grammar records every- day and
are making amazing progress.”

Perhaps for those students
struggling with German, Rus-
sian and Chinese, a few record
“jam sessions” in the Alldred
Room would give a much wel-
comed boost to their ﬁnal grades.

Besides language records, there
is also a tremendous variety of
albums for both education and
pure pleasure.

Some of these include: “Alice
in Wonderland” read by Cyril
Ritchard, “Hitler’s Inferno” in
words and music,‘ “Death of a
Salesman,” “Poems and Tales of
‘Edgar Allen Poe” read by Basil

Rathbone, Art Linkletter’s “House
Party,” and “Pardon My Bloop-
er.”

The library of spoken records
is available to all students Mon-

/day through Friday from 9 a.m.

to 5 p.m. Records of more than
one copy may be circulated.

A big part of Western Electric’s job is to manu-
facture the miniature “new arts” products that
are changing the science of communications.
It’s a job which offers you a challenging career
—a chance to plan new methods of mass pro-
ducing ever-improving kinds of transistors, fer-
rite devices, diodes, special purpose electron
tubes, etc. _

You’ll be with a company that is expanding
rapidly in this ﬁeld. At present our Allentown
and Laureldale, Pa., plants are devoted exclu-
sively to making electron devices, and a big
new" plant is under construction in Kansas
City. The needs of the Bell Telephone System
for these products are increasing daily and
will multiply enormously with the introduc-
tion of Electronic Central Office switching
now nearing trial operation.

These devices are changing the scene at all
our manufacturing plants as they go into the
startling new communications products devel-
oped by our associates at Bell Telephone
Laboratories. From microwave transmission

equipment to submarine cable ampliﬁers, our
products call for creative production engineer-
ing, installation planning, and merchandising
methods. Our job for the Bell System and the
US. government has grown to the point where
we are now one of the nation’s “Top 11” in
industrial sales. And your chance to play an
important part in our future growth is solid!

Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus-
trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business maiors. For more
information, get your copy of Consider a Career at
Western Electric from your Placement Officer. Or write

lPoet L‘evertov
lTo Appear At S

'Demse Levertov, poet and lec-

today at 3 p.m. in the SU lounge.
Selections from her newest book,
“With Eyes at the Back of Our
Heads,” will be ‘read and dis-
cussed.

Miss Levertov has written three
other books in the past 14 years.
Her first collection of poetry “The
Double Image,” was published in
1946. “Here and Now” and “Over-
land to the Islands” soon fol-
lowed.

An extensive traveler, Miss
Levertov has visited Mexico,
France and Italy. She has also
lived in England. In 1948, she
came to the United States for
the first time.

One of the youngest poets to
have her works published in the
“Poetry Quarterly,” Miss Levertov
had her first poem published when
she was sixteen. Since that time
she has written for many other
magazines.

A selection in “Here and Now”
has been praised as one of the
most promising poems Miss Lev-
ertov has produced during her
career. The title of this selection
is “Beyond The Eearth.”

Richard Eberhart of the New
York Times has said that ‘Miss
Levertov writes with a certain
looseness, and devil-may-care at-
titude which expresses maturity.

  Don 't Ruslt Rushing
ii if Tonight, Inter-Fraternity Council will decide upon one
of‘ four rushing plans. The first of these plans is to retain
the present rush system, whereby rushing takes place dur-
ing the ﬁrst few, weeks of the term, followed by a pledging
 period which lasts until the end of the trimester.
it In the past, this’ system has not functioned to the ad-
“vantage of individual men who are interested in: joining a
‘fraternity. The student who has just entered college needs

time to adjust to his studies at the University. Although
social life is important, it is more essential that a student
"ﬁrst develop good study habits, learn to economize his time,
T C A and only then concern himself with ﬁnding social contacts.
4 Becoming acclimated to University academic work is
difficult enough without outside distractions, but when the
,"student spends his ﬁrst few weeks at school “partying,” he
 has little chance to even remain in school. ‘
; , Another disadvantage of the present rush system is that

{all rushees and all fraternity men cannot possibly get to
V .know each other in a three week period. A. prospective
V pledge cannot even get to know all the members of any one
group in that period of time. A i

A freshman then cannot make the wisest choice of a

. fraternity, because he does not have enough knowledge of

each group. Thus, the drop-out rate of pledges has consist-
‘B; ently been between 50 and 60 per cent.

. : The present system has its advantages, but they are.
advantages for thefraternities, notlfor the individualmen.
The shorter the rush period, the less expense for the fra-

* ternity. Also, it is easier for the fraternity to be on its best
behavior for a short period. of time, thus impressing the
’ A , freshmen.
i The other three proposed plans all provide for a longer
Lperiod of time in which a prospective member can become
 acquainted with. the fraternities, as well as adjust to his
Tthemselves. But-their effect in the long run would be for the
\ studies gefore pledging. Inthe short run, these plans have
the previously mentioned di.sadvantages«for the fraternities‘
betterment of the whole fraternity system. ;
If fraternities are sincere in their claims that they
exercise discretion and judgment in choosing their members,
lF will adopt tonight a rush system that is not rushed.

Cubans

 Rodgeri D. Yeager‘ if
The current regime in Cuba

has produced both surprise and

anger among the American peo-
ple. They are surprised to dis-
cover the unique anti-American
fervor present, if \
not only with-
in the govern-
ment, b u t
among the peo-
ple in general. ~‘
They point to
the tacit friend-
liness of the
under
Batista and ask,
“Why do they
now hate us,’
we haven't changed?” And fail-
ing to find an answer, they be-
come angry. .\

We certainly have not chang-
ed. Our foreign policy is the
same toward Cuba now as it was
during the Batista regime. But
the answer to this phenomonen
is that Cuba itself has changed.
It has emerged from a 19th cen-
tury dictatorship into a full-

_ blown 20th century totalitarian

state.

Neorsighfed Selfisliness

United States policy worked

well under Batista. Its essence
was to maintain the stability of
the government in order to in-
sure our economic interests. In
the process, it ignored the Cuban
people because, in a 19th Cen-

 

 Llerse Nor

r

  

  

 e 0'".

com

tury dictatorship, the M people

" have no voice. They are cattle

to be herded by the drivers of
the regime.

We, therefore, supported Ba-
tista with\vast funds and all of
the instruments necessary for his
maintainance in power, reaped

the beneﬁts of unhampered
United States economic gains,
and ignored the insignificant
people.

This type of government has,
of course, inherent weaknesses,
produced mainly by advancing
technology and development,
which inevitably filter to the

. people and make them.a force

to be reckoned with. This ﬁnal-
ly occurred in Cuba. The peas-
ant and proletarian .armies of
Castro overwhelmed the paid
terrorists of Batista and the“19th
century dictatorship vanished in
a vapor of revolutionarypspirit.
In for Good

As Castro needed the people
for his assumption of power, he
now needed them for his con-
tinued maintainance in this po-
sition, for when they are once
admitted to political participa-
tion, they can never again be
ignored.

Unfortunately for the United
States, Castor’s disposition was

not directed to democracy but to T‘

absolutism. And having popular
support now to contend with, his
natural inclination was to total-

ga a

i revolutionary

itarionism. .

It is almost a truism among
totalitarian governments that a
spir'it must be
maintained among the people in
order to pereptuate the legiti-
macy of the absolute ruler or
rulers. Castro realized this and
most naturally maintained this
spirit through hatred of the
Yankee, the supporter of "Batis-
ta, the Pig.” We are, as a result,
hated in Cuba, and, to some ex-
tent, justiﬁably.  ‘

We need not become incoher-
ently angry at the Cubans or
even at Castro, begause the fault
was partly ours. Our policy for-
mulators should long ago have‘
forseen the inevitable clash, of
the 19th and 20th centuries in
Cuba. And they should haveire-
vised their_ policies accordi_ngly.
We Acied Unwisely

If they had included the in-
’terests of the Cuban people in
their appropriations, the United
States would have built up such
a reserve ‘of good will that Cas-
tro would not have dared persue
the course that he did.

The job now is to see to it that
we do not make the same mis-
take again. This writer sees an-
other Batista in Trujillo and an-
other Cuba in the Dominican
Republic. Our policy is virtually
the same as it was concerning.
Cuba, and it must be changed if
we are to avoid the same results.

On Avoiding Mediocrity.  

By Jim Vaughan

It is an unfortunate fact "that people seldom
try their best at what ‘they do (whether their best
is worthwhile is another question). Though the
task may be raking leaves, darning a sock, build-
ing a fence, or explaining an
idea, people are usually satisﬁed
with doing that which is_ merely
acceptable. ' ,

It’s obvious why a person,
when doing at job, should work
as hard and carefully as hecan.
By giving his best to *a task, he
will bring himself the greatest
satisfaction with what he‘~-pro-
duces; he will raise or at least
maintain his se1f—esteem.

Many people want to “suc-
ceed” in life, i.e . . . to earn promotions, to become
head engineers, department chairmen, prominent
professionals, etc. To reach these goals, they must
usually perform at their jobs better than do their
competitors. They must do the best work. ‘Their
chances of doing the ‘better work are greatest if

M they form the habit of always doing their best. »

The college student finds it extremely difﬁcult
to do his best in his work. Here at Pitt, as well as
at all the other schools, the student ﬁnds himself
prohibited from forming these habits. "
Outcome of the Modern Age

No one, I_ believe, is very much at fault here.
This situation is a product of \modern times. To
meet the present needs of our country, to “edu-
cate" the maximum number of students as quickly,
economically and thoroughly as possible, our
schools operate under a system which makes the
eight-term student take about sixteen credits“ worth
of courses per term. Our system does, in effect,
serve to meet these ends efficiently; the intelligent
student who studies hard and judiciously at ﬁve
or six courses each term can and does learn a great
deal. I

But this system has one great drawback.‘ While
it encourages the student to acquire an under-
standing of "the world, it discourages him from
doing his best. ,

The big problem here is that of ﬁnding enough
time to study. The “good student” usually ﬁnds
his courses interesting enough that he would like

to study each of them for ten or twelve hours per,

day, every’ day of the term. [But he" cannot. He
must divide his work among his various courses in
such a way that he manages what he believes to
be the highest possible combination of grades for
time spent studying. . , ‘ “ ii

   
    

    

es usgdo 

  

 

' like this one.)



necessary. ..

Rightfully concerned with the realities of the
grading system, the student learns to budget this
studying time among his many courses. Often,
when he is studying one subject and becoming
quite interested in it, he must ‘stop at a speciﬁed
time and prepare an assignment; in another sub-
ject, ‘which is due the next day. if

Similarly, because his ‘time is at ruch a prem-
ium, he feels himself restricted from going to the
library or book store to get a book and pursuing
an interest in something. (You must immediately
explore a subject in which you become interested,
or the interest will flag and quite possibly die
forever). } \

In another case, the student who is pressed for
time while working oh a paper (and what'student

Ir’

1)!

isn’t) learns that he cannot investigate a subject .
deeply enough, or spend an ‘adequate amount ofx

time in analyzing and revising his paper.

Forced Info Mediocrity

   

B

In short, the student is usually forced to learn T"

to compromise his time, his energies and his stand-
ards of performance. ' y .

_ Some students lack the motivation toitry hard.
Theirs is a lost cause. But others have the wish,

yet feel they cannot afford to spend the time. This‘

is wrong. They must face the fact that if they do
not begin. developing the “perfection\ha‘bit" soon,
they probably never will. It's not as dilﬁcult and
costly as it ﬁrst appears. They can develop the
habit. The pursuit is painful and diﬁicult. It takes
gumption, but it is rewarding.

One way to begin to learn to do the best is to
cultivate the dictionary habit. lf a person forms
the habit of reading with, a dictionary at his elbow

and looking up all words of doubtful meaning, he “i
will develop»automatically the habit of forcing 4,.‘

_ at

himself to understand the meanings of complex‘

sentences and passages in what he reads. V (Just

Another way to cultivate this habit is to pursue
one’s own interests. A student would risk getting
a worse grade in one course in order to satisfy a

g strong interest in some subject like semantics, birth

contr.-E, magnetics, Greece, Shaw, etc.
Most importantof all, the student should study

_ compulsively in at least one of his courses. He

must not permit a single hazy passage to passﬂhis
eyes. He must pursue all questions that arise.
And he must review and‘ re-learn whatever h
should forget. I ‘

habit of trying his hardest-~ at whatever he does

Seidler Stae‘ ie

‘Polish Scholar
Proposes Social
I/alues System

By TOM BRYANT

The primary aim of the
University is to provide con-
ditions in which man’s person-
ality can be fully developel,
according to Dr. Grzegorz
Leopold Seidler, Polish edu-
ator.

The appreciation of beauty‘ and
justice, to recognize the diferences
between good and evil, and to
work out a uniform system of so-
cial values, should be the ultimate
goal of academic training, he con-
tinued.

Dr. Seidler, the Rector of the
Marie Curie-Sklodowskiej Uni-
versity in‘ Lublin, Poland, is vis-
iting the University under the

sponsorship of a Ford Foundation

grant. His stay is in return for a
trip made to Poland last spring
by Dr. John Chapman of the
political science department.
, No Sides Taken

The purpose of Dr. Seidler’s
trip is to stimulate friendly rela-
tions between U.S. and Polish
universities. He firmly believes
that a university cannot take sides
in political, social, or government-
al disputes, but must work to
ﬁnd a palce in man’s society for
the latest technological advances.

,, Seidler feels -that there‘ are no
distinct differences between ed-
ucation in the.U.S. and Poland.
In comparing his school with the
University of Pittsburgh, he
stated that both institutions pos-
sess a similar social environment
with students living on campus
in dormitories.

“Although some U.S. colleges
are more highly developed asla
whole, the Polish pay more at-
tention to the freshmen by pro-
viding the ﬁnest teachers avail-
able for these students,” he said.
Not until the fifth year of college

‘training does his university .en-

courage self-education outsidethe
classroom, Seidler explained.
Communists Subsidize

Dr. Seidler is a member of the
Polish Communist Party’s Central
Committee for Education. Al-
though the party does not main-
tain any controls over his school,
it annually subsidizes the Marie
Curie University and critically
evaluates the- school every three
years. In this way, Seidler says

P president-elect John

Cyrus Levinthal
To Give Talk In

Biological Series

Professor Cyrus Levinthal will
speak on “Genetic Control And
Regulation ,O:£ A
Bacterial Enzyme” Friday at 4:30
p.m. in L9 GHC.

This lecture is the second in
the 1960-1961 series being spon-
sored by the Department of Bio-
logical Sciences of the University.

Levinthal received his B.A_.
from Swarthmore College and his
_Ph.D. from the University of
California. He is currently a pro-
fessor of Biophysics at Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, and

has published work in the ﬁelds

of virus multiplication and gene-
tics, and nucleic acid structure.

In his research Levinthal has
utilized the technique of radio-
active decay of labeled phos-
phorus in nucleic acid, a material
which determines heredity.

The lecture is open to the pub-
lic. There is no admission fee.

the party _fulfills its desire to
create the ﬁnest in skilled work-
ers. .
Turning to politics, Dr. Seid-
ler said that the Russians have
no inﬂuence in the Polish gov- A
ernment but are merely friendly
neighbors. He reports: “Polish
elections are always free, just as
in the U.S., with ‘the names of
several parties and candidates
on the ballots.”

He calls‘ Nikita Khrushchev “a
good Communist,” deeply dedi-
cated to world peace. As for"
Kennedy,
Seidler refers to him as “very in-
telligent and sophisticated.” The
Polish educator was very impress-
ed by the election of such a young
man as Kennedy to the presi-
dency.

Paths Differ

The Polish people do not be-
lieve that there will be another
world war, Seidler said. “All
peoples of the world want to im-
prove the standard of living, al-
though they may take different
paths to obtain their goals. Peace
cannot be obtained from mere
hoping and wishing, but from ac-
tively working together for the
common good,” he said.

Dr. Seidler revealed that
Chancellor Litchﬁeld is very
well known in Poland. Litch-
ﬁeld led a delegation of Amer-
ican educators through Russia
and Poland two years ago and
since has become widely respect-
ed as one of America’s fore-
most administrators.

Dr. Seidler‘s current tripis his
first to the United States. Prior
to coming to the University, he-
spent ﬁve weeks at Yale, Harv-
ard, Princeton, and Columbia
University. Upon leaving ‘Pitts-
burgh this Sunday, he will spend
ﬁve additional Weeks in the U.S.
before returning to Poland.

In spite of the many modern
advances that Dr. Seidler observ-
ed since arriving in the U.S., the
experience that impressed him
most happened here in Pittsburgh.

Lazier, Parker
Present Opera
‘The Telephone’

By TRUDY VVEISS

The Pitt Players’ command
performance of “Tie Tele-
phone” was well presented
despite the uninteresting ma-
terial provided by the com-
poser, Gian Carlo-Menotti.

Kyp Parker’s delightful soprano
voice was one of the two enter-
taining factors of the production.
Equally effective was her baritone
co-star, Gil Lazier.

Whereas Miss Parker shone in
the musical end, Lazier’s actions,
considering the difficult role, with
which he had to work, were ex-
pressive enough to steal some of
the spotlight from her.

was written for an English-spealv
ing audience. Perhaps °opcra loses
its appeal in our nativetongue.
It seems then to be a force in it-
self of opera, which is tradition-
ally sung in the continential Eu-
ropean languages.

If not lacking appeal. then his
farce is either outdatex’ or just
doesn’t have enough substance
even for a half hour show.

According to the dress styles on
the characters and to the set
which, incidentally, was given a
very lifelike atmosphere in the
round, the action\cou1d take place
today. Both set and dress lent a
colorful air to the production.

Plot Absurd

The basis of this farce was

poorly selected. There was very

little to work with in the role
of Ben, played by Lazier. After
ten _minutes, his futile attempts
to attract Lucy (Kyp Parker)
away from ‘his competitor, the
telephone, become monotonous.

It takes the viewer this long
to realize that there is not much
more to the idea of the opera, and
he begins to hope for an interest-
ing conclusion at least. Once more
he is diappointcd.

The “p10” is an absurd idea:
Ben, who tries desperately to pro-
pose marriage to Lucy in a short.
space of time, must compete with
her friends on the telephone for
her attention.

\ Finally. giving up, he hurries

otf to catch his train, and tele-
phones Lucy from the station
to accomplish his aim.

Yugoslavian Visitors
View School System

_ By JIM NELSON .
Last Week six members of the Federal Institute of Pub-

lic Administration of Yugoslavia visited the University.
L. T. Kadelburg, director of the Federal Institute of Pub-

lic Administration, acting as s

pokesman for the group, com- _'

mented that they were interested in the United States school

system.

\

"For comparison,” said Kadel-6

burg. “I would underline the high
school level. In Yugoslavia our
high schools are open to all with-
out reserve. There is no specific
tuition tax.” '
Grants Differ

He commented that more scho-

larships in Yugoslavia were grant-

ed by the government and Econo-

mic organizations than by t h e
schools, and various other sources

in the U.S. ‘

“When a scholarship is grant-
ed,” Kadelburg said, “the indus-
try or business concern that
grants them requires the stu-
dent to return after graduation
and work for twice the time
spent in school.”

Kadelburg commented that in
Yugoslavia one university does
not recognize the degrees of an-
other university.

Schools Meet Needs

In the United States,” he con-
tinued, “there are many general,
or liberal arts colleges. In Yugo-
slavia schools are organized for
speciﬁc needs and instruction. Our

' teachers divide their time equal-

ly between research and study,”
he said.

Commenting on the past presi-
dential election, Kadelburg said
that the United State’s elec-
tions are very business-like,
while those in Yugoslavia are
very pompous.

Also visiting the University last‘
week was Dr. Sripati Chandra-
sekhar, the Ford Visiting Lecturer
in Development Planning and
Administration.

the death rate has not been able
to keep pace.

“This has created serious pro-
blems,” said Chandrasekhar. “The
level of living is very low. Sixty-
five million people in India go to
bed hungry every night because
there just is not enough food to
go around. There are about 15
thousand people to every doctor.”

When asked to comment on the
trimester system at the Univer-
sity, Dr. Chandrasekhar said, “I
fully agree with the University’s
trimester system. In India we do
little studying during the sum-
mer because of the uncomfortable
heat, but with the pleasant
weather of the United States, too
much time is wasted vacationing
when valuable study could be
carried on.”

ing in a new fad or craze. One
time it’s carts, another it’s cars.

Dr. Barbara McIntyre, director
of the play and associate ‘director
of speech at the University, said,
“Although the play is a children's
classic, it contains much adult ap-
peal.”

Assistant director for the pro-
duction is Ruth Beall, and Eleanor
Irwin is the stage manager. The
lead role of Toad is played by
Fred Hecker. ‘

C O . Q 0
By Serlous In]ur1es
. ‘ By JACK SMITH . 0
After last weeks 7-7 tie with Army, allthoughts of a

bowl bid have been dispelled.

Now the Panthers can settle

down to the task at hand, Penn State.

:State, holder of a 5-3 record, could still be in line for a
bowl invitation should they beat the Panthers. Pitt, on the
other hand, is struggling through a rough schedule with a

4-2-3 record that show two points<>

separatinggwthem from an unde-
feated season. ‘

The Panther’s only defeats were
to UCLA 8-7‘ and Oklahoma 15’-14.
Both d e f e a t s ‘ '
were by ,0 n e
point.

“There is only
one place we
can look now,”
C o a c h J o h n
M i c h e l o s e n
said, “and that.
is to Penn State.
We have to be,
ready for them;
t h e y will be
ready for us.”

However, the Panthers have
two key injuries that could have
a great affect on their offensive.
Regis Coustillac, starting left
guard, is still being hampered
by an ankle injury.

Quarterback Jim Traﬁcant may
not see action either as his in-
jured arm has not been responding
to treatments. With Traﬁcant
throwing passes the Panthers will
have to upend State’ with their
ground game.

Only Pride Hurt

Center Andy Kuzneski summed
up the injury situation when he
said that, “the main thing hurt
after the Army game is our pride.”

Last year the Panthers stopped
the bowl Lions 22-7 behind the
running‘ of the C-Boys. The
Lions ﬁnished the season with a
9-2 mark and went to the Lib-
erty Bowl. , _

Again this year the C-Boys,
Fred Cox, Bob Clemens and Jim
Cunningham are leadinglthe Blue
and Gold in rushing after nine
games. Clemens is the leading
ground gainer having netted 349
yards in 74 carries.

Traﬁcant Leads Passers

Traﬁcant is the‘leadi'ng passer
having attempted 57 passes com-
pleting 29 for 407 yards and four
touchdowns.

Fred Cox is the Panther’s top
performer in almost every sta-
tistical department. He is see-

Cox’s 40.2 average has earned
him the reputation of being one of
the best college punters in the na-

as 10-0 and 6-3. .

So far this season the Lions
have posted an unimpressive re-
cord of three wins and four de-
feats. As have the Panthers, the
Lions have started a late season

team 1-0 and beating the prev-
iously undefeated Temple squad

By JIM O’BRIEN

The ride back from New York
seemed far longer than the mile-
age indicated as the Panther var-
sity and frosh harriers brooded
over their shabby showing in the
ICAAAA cross-country champion-
ship on the" Van Courtland Park

course. , .

Penn State, which humbled the
Cats in the second duel meetiof
the year,'swept team honors. Bob
Loew of Brown, who ﬁnished sec-
ond in 1959, won individual hon-
ors as he ﬁnished 25 yards ahead
of the closest man.

Th’: Panthers had no chance for
team honors mainly because they
entered only a trio of .competitors,
but secondly because the ones who

were in the distance-running ex-

travaganza hiked through the
woods at a snail’s pace.

The Lions defense has been
their biggest trouble all season.
Only recently, has the defense
begun to jell. Goalie _Dave
Grubbs gave the Panthers a
hard time last year and should
give them just as much trouble
this year.

“Our defense will have to be
tougher against Penn State than
it was against Lock Haven,” com-
mented Coach Bemis. “State us-
ually handles usipretty well but
last year we humiliated them by
winning. This year they will pro-
bably be out for blood.”

Short Passes
The Lions play a game using
short passes and try to maintain
control of the ball. Penn State
uses its wings. a lot in its scor-
ing plays. .

. The booters will go into the
game in good shape physically.
The only question mark in
Coach Bemis’ mind is Corky

but may not be in top condi-

I I I All-American
Mike Ditka -
,.In Last Game

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor I

 

For the past three years the Panther football fans have been fol-
lowing the play of End Mike Ditka. For better than two years Ditka
has shown that he was one of the best ends in the country.

Pitt’s publicity director, Beano Cook, was pushing Ditka for All-
American. Last year he was selected to several All-American teams
and this year Mr. Cook had visions of his end making most of the

Over that two and a half year span Ditka played some outstand-
ing ball games, some mediocre ones and rarely a bad one. Up until
the Syracuse game this year I was convinced that Ditka was a good
end but I was skeptical when I read such statements as “the best end
in the country,” and “picks up halfbacks and swallows them whole.”
Such statements, I thought, were a little exaggerated. i

That is up until the Syracuse game. Prior to the game Ditka
was told by Cook, “Mike if you are going to make All-American
it will have to be this game.” '

Well I have seen a lot.of good ends in my short years of view-
ing football, but none could have equalled Ditka’s performances
against Syracuse, Notre Dame and Army.

A few small incidents: against Notre Dame the big end’ hurt his
leg and was limping. The Irish quarterback quickly spotted this and
ran the next play in Ditka’s direction. Mike saw the play coming, was
hit by the blocking fullback, made the ball carrier go to the outside,
with the blocker still trying to get Mike out of the play the big end
made the tackle. And all that time Ditka was limping badly.

The same game he was the first one down on a punt.. He dived
at the ball carrier and tripped him up. But the Irish halfback
kept his. footing and started downﬁeld. Ten yards later Ditka made
the tackle. How he was able to get up from a prone position and
catch the speedy halfback I’ll never know. I

These two plays are not the unusual for Ditka but the ordinary.
Time after time the big end can be seen making open ﬁeld tackles ‘by
himself. Other times he catches enemy backs on the opposite end of
the line before they have passed the line of scrimmage.

With his last game coming up Saturday Ditka will be ready to
hang up his gridiron spikes for Pitt. It will be a long time before
Pitt will ever see another player with the tremendous desire and spirit
of the big end from Aliquippa. So long number 89.

News Hawks
Ready for 3rd
Blood Bowl

If you thought the game
between Holland and Mc-
Cormick was a riot, just wait
until the Blood Bowl. How-
ever, be prepared for a grue-
some sight of head-bashing

and bone-breaking that will cur-
dle your blood.

The Blood Bowl is so horrible
that Athletic Director Ted Colton
has scheduled the game at 9 a.m.
this Saturday in order that the
early hour will discourage patrons
who can't stand the sight of blood.

Pitt Stadium will be the sight
of the massacre of Penn State’s
ignoble Cowards. Coach “Scoop”
Smith has come up with some ad-
ditional recruits to insure victory
and give depth to the roster.

Two of the most highly touted
recruits comes from the sports
staff. They are Johr “Shrimp”
Fleming and Jim “Juggernaut”
O’Brien. These two form an un-
beatable passing combination.

Here’s their secret: “Juggernaut”
O’Brien' hands the ball off to
“Shrimp” Fleming, who is about
the same size as a football. Then he
just picks up Fleming and throws
him for a sizeable gain.

“Terrible Tom” Bryant, “Tricky
Dicky” Klein, and “Awesome Al”
Johnson form the most solid for
ward wall in Pitt News history. To
add injury to insult Bill “Poet”
Bennett has a cast iron football
ready for the game in case the
Cowards kick off first. ,

Coach Smith has an illegal
weapon ready for action in case
the going gets tough. It’s Murray
“Red-Shirt” Chass back for his
third season of eligibility.

Marshall “Lardbottom” Romeo
has been polishing his brass
knuckles for the tilt, but he will
be pressed hard for his position by
two newcomers to the sports staff,
Dave “Speedo” Scapes and Dave
“Razlzle-dazzle” Sharp.

It is rumored that Captain John
Black of Penn State can't find
enough fellows with sufficient
courage to face the News Hawks,
so he will be bringing girls in a
last-ditch effort to win.

In Battle With Army

End Considers Himself ‘Lucky’ _.

To Have Been on Panther Team‘

B! JACK

SMITH

Last week Coach John Michelosen singled out Mike Ditka
and Ron Delﬁne for outstanding play in the Army game. An-
other reason why Delﬁne has to be considered one of Pitt’s

best ends.
“Ron played an outstand

ing game,” Michelosen said.

“He‘s a hustler and has been an asset to us all year.”

Delfine, however, consi d e r s9
himself lucky. “At 190 pounds I'm

We have many good ends so I
feel lucky that I have been play-
ing so consistently,”

To the players Ron is called
Runt for short. As a sophomore,
a friend from Canonsburg, Del-
ﬁne’s home town, came to visit
him. “Is Runt here,” the friend
asked. Needless to say a foot-
ball player caught the name and

’Delﬁne has been stuck with it
throughout college.

If you were to look at his
brothers, the name would have
even more of an impact. His one
older brother Bill is 6’-11”, the,
other brother, Mickey, is 65-2”.
The Runt claims to be over 5’-1l",
with his high shoes on.

He also has a sister Denise,
ﬁve. His parents Vanderine and’
Helen still reside in Cannonsburg.

Ron likes all sports. Bowling
and golf are among his favorite.

Recently he hit 120, for nine
holes. Even at that, Delﬁne ad-
mits he had to cheat pust a lit-

tle.
Delfine has had many big mo-
ments in Panther sports. He re-

.members most vividly the Notre

Dame game last year when he
blocked the way for Bill Kaliden
to score the winning touchdown
with 11 seconds left.

There was the Penn State game
last year and Syracuse and Army
this year. Before the season start-
ed all the seniors on the team
picked a game they thought the
Panthers would win. If their team
won in that game they would
claim the football. Delfine proud-
ly holds possession of the ball in
the 10-0 winover Syracuse this
season.

Players and coaches are in
agreement that the Panthers will
lose one of Pitt’s best ends when
Ron Delfine ﬁnishes this season.

Soon to Get Underway

Basketball, Wrestling, Gymnastic Teams

Busy at Work Preparing for Season Openers

The temperature may be in the sixties but this is no in-
dication that winter is far away. And when the cold months
set in they bring with them the Panther winter sports pro-

gram.

For the past. weeks the Panthers’ gym, wrestling and
basketball teams have been busy preparing for their season

openers. The gym and wrestlingé

teams will have to wait for the
new year to begin, but the hoop-

ers will start action December 2
against Purdue.

Coach Bob Timmons. will have
a strong array of talent to com-
pact the traditionally tough Pan-
ther schedule. Returning from ].ast
year’s squad are lettermen John
Fridley, Dick Falenski and Bob
Sankey.

Defensive Expert

Fridley and Falenski are seniors
who were responsible for many
of the Panther’s wins last year.
Fridley is a defensive expert
while Falenski handles the scor-
ing duties. .

Sankey is a junior guard. He
possesses a ﬁne jump shot and
can drive on a man to man de-'
fense. To round out the. start-
ing ﬁve Timmons has Don

Steinhart and Ben Jinx.

Steinhart will be the Panthers’
other big man, with Fridley. Jinx,
a sophomore, may be the Cats
answer to that scoring threat they
have been lacking since the de-
parture of Don Hennon.

Rex Peery’s matmen are look-
ing to a banner year. With his

first four wrestlers returning
Peery should have the best mat
team in the country.

Dick Martin, Larry Lauchle,
Daryl Kelvington and John Zo-
likoff all ﬁnished the regular
season last year undefeated.

Add to this foursome Jim Har-
-rison, a promising sophomore,
and Bob Guzik, an experienced
heavyweight, and the Panther
wrestling team can look forward
to another winning season.

The main threat to the matmen
will be grades. If the Cats are
not floored by the text books, the
rest of the season should provide
some interesting results. Peery
will put his wrestlers to work in
the pre-season tournament at
Wilkes Barre, Pa.

The gymnastic picture should
be an interesting one this year.
The gymnasts have been working
longer than the wrestlers a nd
hoopers. Coach Warren Neigler
has a good nucleus to form a well
rounded team. '

The loss of standouts Dave
Hirst and Don Kasner. will hurt
the Panthers, but returnees Earl
McConnell and Joe Battaglia can
lead the Cats to a good season.

French Soloist’s
Performance

Christian Ferras, a phenomenal

this week-end with the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra under the
direction of William Steinberg.

Ferras will be heard in a rarely
performed work on the “Sym-
phonie Espangnole” of Lalo. This
work is both a brilliant concerto
and a kind of synopsis of Spanish
folk music. It was originally writ-
ten in five movements and pre-
sented as a suite, in spite of its
concerto-like characterization. For
this performance only four of the
movements will be played because
of the work’s great length.

Also featured on the program
will be the World_ Premiere of
David Sheinfe1d’s “Etudes for Or-
chestra.” The composer played
viola during the 1944-45 Season
with the Pittsburgh Symphony
and is now a member of the vio-
lin section of the San Francisco
Symphony.

The program will conclude with
the “Great C Major” Symphony
of Franz Schubert. This is the
work which solidiﬁed Schubert’s
hold on immortality.

Tickets for the Friday evening
performance at 8:40 and the Sun-
day afternoon performance at
3:10 are available at the box
offices at Kaufmann’s, Gimbels’
and Horne’s, and at the Univer-
sity Book Center. Information
and reservations may be obtained
by calling COurt 1-5853.
