Pitt’ students will be paying an
average of I28 percent more fortui-
tion this fall as a result of the new
$287.5 million university budget
passed last week by the Board of
Trustees. .

Tuition for most full-time under-
graduates will increase by l0 per-
cent. but many students will have to
pay an additional 20 to .30 percent.
According to university figures,
first—year medical students living
outside Pennsylvania will have to
pay $l3.350 a year, a 50 percent
hike. ’
_ Medical students at all levels face
the highest tuition increases in the
school’s history. with l7 percent

hikes for upperclassrnen from
$6,740 to $7,900, and 32 percent
raises for in-state freshmen. who will
pay $8,900 a year.

. than

last year’s. although the
national inflation rate has been ll.7
percent. Chancellor Wesley Posvar
said that the main reason for the
tuition hike is the small increase in
state appropriations for the
university.

"Pitt recently received $74.7 mil-
lion from the Commonwealth when
Gov. Thornburg signed the annual
appropriations package last week.
The bill increases state support by
5.l percent over last year's amount.

Posvar also added that the record— .

high tuition for medical students is
necessary because state funding for
the School of Medicine has not
increased since I972.

A lone vote was cast against the

hikes by trustee Alfred E. Lawson. lt

, is the second year in a row he has

voted against it.

L_awson’s primary concern is that
Pitt may become a school for the
wealthy. His alternative to the cur-
rent plan involves cutting away
unnecessary departments and
programs.

“Athletics might be cut, and there
are some other departments that can
be cut down." Lawson said.

Lawson is also against expan-
sions. such as construction ofa new
business school, that depletethe uni-

.vers_ity‘s “hard cash fund."

Other features of the budget
include an added $l l.6 million for

[Pitt Admits To $l.5 Million Loss

In a statement issued yesterday, the University of Pittsburgh.
acknowledged the “potential loss” of$l.5 million in short-term physi-
cal plant investment funds through a I979 securities swindle. V

In addition to Pitt, four otherinstitutional investors were taken for

over $8 million by Texas-based securities firm headed by former

Dallas Cowboy’s receiver Bill Howton. - ‘ ~ ’
According to university officials, the manager responsible for the

investment decision was fired in Sept. of I979 once “the problem” was 1

The funds used for investment came from specially restricted cash
reserves intended for physical repairs and renovations of the univer-

Officials maintain that there is no evidence of “malfeasance” on‘the
part of any university employees, but that “in an effort to maximize
the university's return on its investments, the university’s investment
manager erred in dealing with a seldom-used securities broker."

Howton, along with two associates, went on trial in Houston yester-
day as a result of a 27 count indictment that included charges offraud

Theodore Corbett, assistant treasurer for Pitt in 1979, andcurrently
on the staff of the office ofthe vice chancellorfor health professions, is
scheduled to testify for the prosecution sometime this week.

Brinkley Changes Plea: Not Guilty

Sidney Brinkley, alleged killer of Pitt student Monica R. Jones, has
changed his plea from guilty to not guilty. I

As a consequence, Common Pleas Judge Ralph J. Cappy.has
scheduled jury selection to begin on Aug. l3. .

Brinkley, already convicted of murdering three Philadelphia
women, was chargedilast year with the rapeand strangulation murder

lt was reported that in ‘exchange for a guilty plea, the district
attorney‘s office was to recommend that Brinkley serve a life sentence.
Now that he has reversed his position, the prosecution will be asking
for the death penalty if Brinkley is convicted of first degree murder.
Brinkley, now scheduled to serve three consecutive life sentences for
‘ his previous convictions, is expected to stand trial’on Aug. 18. 7

2 (First of a series)
By LINDA ‘MILLER 7

Pitt l\-lews Staff Writer-

How much student participation
and input is there on the Senate
Council and I3 Senate Standing
Committees‘? 7 7 V

‘The question is-a fair and perti-
n€nt one,«especial__ly in light of the
council's recent approval of a prop-
osal that makes class attendance
mandatory for first-year _athletes
and athletes on academic probation.

After learning that only three of
the 54 student representatives "serv-

‘ing on the Senate Council and com-

mitteee vetediin the recent Senate,
Council elections and only~one”of
the six student representativesjon

council was present at last month's i
meeting when the controversial class -
_ attendance proposal was presented,

one could conclude that student par-
ticipation and input is practically
nil- I ' i ’

To.do so, however, would be an ‘

oversight. Forin this case, student

participation and input falls" into

three classifications (undergraduate,
general studies,‘and‘gradua.te) and is
present on two levels (council and
committee). A 1

Watching
  Reagan’s  
Choice

President Reagan has made an adept polit-
ical move in following through on his cam-
paign promise to nominate a woman to th_e~»-‘

A Supreme Court. . I .

His historic selection of -Arizona Judge \
Sandra O’Connor——the first woman to be
nominated for ther traditionally all-male .'
court was applauded as a significant victory
for women’s rights.

In addition to the fact that the nominee is a
woman, what exactly she stands for and how
she fits into Reagan’s scheme of things is also
important. _

For a candidate who received heavy sup-
port from the Moral Majority‘, Reagan has
indicated, by this appointment at least, that
he does not embrace their views.

Mrs. O’Connor is pro-choice and a backer
of the Equal Rights Amendment. It is not
suprising, then, that her appointment was
met with opposition by the Rev. Jerry Fal-
well and anti-abortion groups. _

Reagan‘s appointment does represent his
philosophy of the power of the courts—to

interpret the law and not to make it,

These factors are only sketchy details
about what is known about Mrs. O’Connor’s
political position and Reagan's view of the
role of the Supreme Court.

What is left to be discovered is the more
important question. _ '

When former President Richard Nixon
had the opportunity to nominate a number of
Supreme Court Justices, it gave him the
power to shape the court according to his
political nhilosophies.

With the retirement of Justice Potter Stew-
art and the nomination of Mrs. O’Connor,
Reagan also hasthe, chance to make his mark
on. the legal decisions of the nation’s highest
court.

What exactly that_ will be and how it will
affectthe outcome of future court decisions is
something to be watched closely—_-as closely’ _ _ ,
as the whole nomination process ,t.hat,rnay  7 I

Applauding Upgrading tandards

n Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my reac-
tion to the recent decision by the
Senate Council to require Pitt ath-
letes to attend classes and submit
attendance cards as proof.

The Pitt News’ editorial position
is_ against this, as is the position
taken by ‘Bill Abraham, president of
the ‘Student Government Board.
Both assert that the requirement is,
in their words, “discriminating
against a certain class of students”.

‘I am appalled at the narrow-
minded approach to this issue taken
by these people. As an alumnus and
formerly with SGB, I applaud the
Senate Council‘s efforts to upgrade
the academic standing of some ath-
letes while assuringicontinued aca-
demic excellence of the rest.

While attending Pitt, each month
I was required to submit an attend-
ance card to the Veterans office.
Failure to timely submit this card
resulted in cancellation of my V. A.

- benefits. It was part of the program.

The cards resulted from some irres-
ponsible veterans who enrolled for
full-time classes, collected full-time
V.A. beneﬁts based upon that en-
rollment, and subsequently dropped

/.

classes. Thus, their attending Pitt
was, in reality, on a part-time basis.
Because of a few, the whole had to

submit the cards. In the beginning it.

was bothersome, but to those veter-
ans who were honest and complied
with V.A procedures all along while
at Pitt, it was only a minor
inconvenience.

This requirement for athletes
illustrates the University’s attempt
to assure those athletes on athletic
scholarships that their degrees do
mean something. Most athletes are
responsible enough to take advan-
tage of attending classes. Those ath-
letes who ‘feel that they have a
four-year free ride’ should be the

ones to feel threatened.

Discriminatory? Yes it is! It dis-
criminates for academic integrity
and against the “dumb jock" syn-
drome. Never have I heard from the
SGB President any criticism about
Pitt’s Affirmative Action Program.
This..program discriminates also: it
discriminates for those people who
need help in asserting their rights
and against those whose bigotry
would deny them “their rights. ‘But,
Mr. Abraham, this program also
singles out a certain class of
students. ‘

Where was other student. input‘?
According to Mr. Abraham. one of
the student representatives had
graduated and the other was away at
home. He said he was unaware ofthe

‘ proposal until it was presented at the

meeting. Oh, come on! First gradua-
tion was in April and the meeting of
the Senate Council was in June: it
takes six weeks to fill a committee
vacancy? Regarding beingvunaware,
prior to their appointment in Sep-
tember, I980, all‘Senate representa-
tives were _instructed to fill out

‘Senate meeting report forms after’

each meeting attended. If these
forms were filled out, then knowl-
edge ofthe up-coming agenda would

have been received. Were instruc-_ V

tions to these representatives only
talk, with no real follow-up to assure
compliance with standards‘? I guess
it’s too much effort to take responsi-
bility. Where‘ was the Board’s liason

' director to the Athletic Director‘?

Again I thankthe Senate Council
for their wisdom. The problems
experienced by those universities in’
the Southwestern United States will

- be avoided here at Pitt.

The Semester-at-Sea program, in

? parts of the world, is the result of a
 ollaborative effort between Pitt
gand the Institute for Shipboard

and 22 faculty members in tow.
Ten of the ship’s crew members

' were Pitt students, with the rest

coming mainly from the West,

where the national
-originated.

Pitt's involvement gave the pro-
gram academic acceptibility; partici-
pating students were eligible for col-
lege credit.

Before docking in San Francisco
on May It’), the S.S. Universe visited -
a total of ten countries. ‘ ‘

Dr. Keith McDufﬁe, the ship’s
acedemic dean, described the whole
experience as simply “fantastic.”

“There’s nothing like it,’.‘ McDuf-
fie, a Pitt Latin American Studies
professor, said. “It makesquite a
difference when you’re only talking
about. something, than when you go
out and actually see it. You get the
sense that the world’s not as big as
you think.”

The ship visited Kenya, _Hong
Kong,‘ Taiwan, China, Japan, lndia,
Sri Lanka, Brazil, South Africa. and
Venezuala. ‘ ' . ‘

The ship's students had plenty of
opportunities to see firsthand what

program

they -could only read about in a_ -'

classroom. _ _
At each of the ports, the students
had the optionof either seeing the '

- country with a guided t-our, or tak-

ing offon their own to explore it.
On board, class schedules
McDufﬁe described as “intensi\<.e"
were held. A
The students were required t__'o_
take four hour-and-l5-minute

classes during the term. The day‘s

schedule "ran from 8 a.m. to 6 pm:
There were ten classrooms on board.

Each faculty member taught three
classes per term. Six Pitt faculty
members. as well as faculty members

McDufﬁ'e said the program cur-
ric.ulum was designed “to take-the
world into account.”

Oceanography, ecology, compar-
ative literature,,anthropology and
‘intercultural communications were
some of the course offerings.

The students spent their time on ’

board for studying because when the
ship docked, they generally had

g" from three to five days-to explore the
country, McDuffie said.

The students received a warm
receptiorralmost everywhere they
stopped, according to .McDufﬁe.

“To many of the countries,'Amer-
ica represents something special,” he
said; “The things we do affect them.‘“

The Chinese were especially inter-
ested in Americans, McDuffie said.
After living under an authoritarian

“regime for so long, “they’re hungry

to know what‘s‘going on,” he said.
But it wasn’t all smooth sailing.
The trip wasn’t'without the aca_- '

qdemic ‘and "disciplinary problems

The Semester-at-Sea program got"
off to a rocky start last year.

ln‘ the spring of I980, it was
applauded by Pitt Chancellor Wes-

Last October, it was voted down
by the College of Arts and Sciences.

That gesture was irrelevant in a
sense—Pitt was already legally
bound to the program for two years.

But criticisms thatthe program
was designed only .for the wealthy,
was weak academically, and was
“morally inappropriate” because of
a scheduled stop in South Africa still
remained.

Its all. said and-done now, and

McDuffie has a different basis for-

responding to the programs critics.

McDuffie discounted criticisms of
the South African visit. He said stu-
dents were able to see firsthand the
effects of the political situation they
were reading about. He , also

-explained that the students went
frthrough-the homelands ofthe blacks

in South Africa. McDuffie said the
white ruling minority "put _aside

r_.separate homelands for the blacks-in
' order to prevent them from“r__eceiv-
ing any citizenship rights in South A

Africa. “But they use them as a labor

cop-out." . .
.To' cut. off_7 contact with South
Africa means to cutoff.an.y influence»
the United’ States might have in eas-
ing the conflict,'McDufﬁe said..
As for criticisrrgof the program.‘s
academic merits, ,McDuffie,said he
believes it was caused by incomplete

‘ information.
Now that the first term has been i
3 completed and more information is
:available. McDuffie said he believes
he Semester-at-Sea program will be t
, seen as an opportunity for an impor-

ant, valid ed ucational_experience.

of the impressions left with Pitt,

Yesterday, the Eastern 8 came,
met, and took one’ step closer to
being conquered.

The Eastern 8’s inability to
accomplish its objectives continued
to linger as athletic directors met for
4% hours yesterday at the Greentree
Marriot Inn and adjourned until
November with some major issues
still swirling above their heads like a

‘storm cloud in a holding pattern.

As expected, League Commis-
sioner Leland Byrd asked for future
committments of one to two years
from the Eastern 8 members and no

one raised a hand.

League expansion was discussed
and a list of possible colleges to
extend league membership invita-
tions was drawn up, but formal
action on expansion will wait until
after the Novemeber meeting.

Byrd reported that his year-long
effort to line up a television package
for the Eastern 8 has not yet been
and the membership
authorized him to keep searching for
sponsors to get the league oniTV this
year. Byrd was told to submit a pro-
gress report to the schools by the end
of July. ” ‘

If the results weren’t anticipated

so accurately going into the meeting, '

it would've been a disappointment

instead ofjust an exercise.
“Nothing was really accomp-
lished," said Pitt Athletic Director
Cas Myslinski last night. Myslinski
characterized .the attitude of the
attending athletic directors as a

“wait and see” outlook.

“All the AD‘s think it's a good
conference and that our tournament
is very successful here in Pitts-
burgh," Myslinski said. “They’re all
participating and are active in the
discussions, but not much was
decided.”

One subject that wasn’t discussed
much at the meeting, according to
Myslinski, was the chances of the
proposed all-sports Eastern league
and how it will affectthe Eastern 8.
‘With the new league looming larger
on» the horizon after. last Wednes-
day‘s meeting in Philadelphia and its
agreement to meetiagain later this
month. The East conference‘s
shadow casts added gloom as the
sun sets behind the Eastern 8. _

“The Eastern 8 is bound to be
threatened by the proposed league,
but the athletic directors weren’t
saying much about it," Myslinski
said. “It was avoided. They’re con-

cerned they can’t continue ifthe'new ~

conference is built."

One reason is the loss of possibly
three of the Eastern 8’s members-
West Virginia, Rutgers, and perhaps

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pitt News Stall Writer
Pitt Athletic Director Cas Mys-
linski took a suprise trip to Philadel-
phia last Wednesday and breathed a
small bit of life into the proposed
Eastern league. Or was Myslinski
just inﬂating hopes? ’
b . Seven other Eastern colleges sent
‘representatives—most of them
athletic directors—to the meeting
and tossed around generalities con-
cerning the formation of the
league—with its format ranging

from an all-sports conference to a

football and basketball conference
to one primarily for football.

But the biggest news to come from
the meetings was the mere presence
of Myslinski, who as late as last

Tuesday was steadfastly repeating
his disinterest in the Eastern League,
although he added “the door is still

‘ open.”

Wednesday in Philadelphia, he
walked right through it. Why?

“We (Pitt) didn’t want to be the
guys with the black hats holding
things up,” Myslinski said Friday.
“We’re just trying to get an idea
which schools are doing what.”

In other words, Pitt is straddling
the fence. Myslinski -said the 4'/2-
hour meeting was a general? discus-

.sion of TV contracts, revenue

sharing, academic standards, league

_ ﬁnancing, possible bowl tie-ins, cur-

rent conference committments and
the choice of a league commissioner.

And while Myslinski added the
initial meeting did little to push him
into hurling Pitt’s hat into the ring, it

=  didn’t hurt either.

‘What Pitt and Mys-linski want is
an.al_l-sports version of the league,

VIEWPOINT

the lucrative Big East basketball
conference, balking at such a head-
long leap. A
Presumably, Pitt and Penn State,
another all-sportsiiproponent, could
exert pressure through its -football
programs on Boston College and
Syracuse, which has a new Carrier

Dome to fill on fall Saturdays, to-
agree to terms. And Myslinski likes

Pitt's chances. _

“More teams are thinking in terms
of a full sport conference, and from
that standpoint, we’re moving in the
right direction," Myslinski said, who
characterized his presence at the
meeting as “observer and not a par-
ticipant,” although he added “it’s
difficult not to get drawn into dis-
cussions.” __ 

With the uncertainty clouding the
Eastern 8—the basketball league
without a television contract, pres-
tige, or, as someone described it:
“the greatest little basketball league
in the country two nights a year"——
Pitt is determined not to “sit around
and watch the league (Eastern 8) col-
lapse around us,” in the words of
Panther basketball Coach Roy
Chipman. , 

And there is a chance the Eastern
8 could do just that-crumble. After
this year’s reprieve, with all eight
teams committed for the I98!-82
season, West Virginia and Rutgers
are in the thick of the new Easfern
league discussions. If they left to join
Penn_ State, Boston College, Syra-
cuse, and perhaps Navy and Army in

a new, league, it’s'doubtful Pitt '

would be far behind. -  ' A

But until someone makes the first

Pitt-—should the new conference
form. At yesterday’s meetings. a list

_ of colleges were discussed for possi-

ble formal invitation into the East-
ern 8 as a contigency plan against
defections. ’

“If somebody leaves, they want to
be sure they can replace them with
other teams," Myslinski explained.
“Depending on the commitments in
November, if the league loses two
teams, we'll try to pick up two more
and try to keep it at eight.”

Although Myslinski couldn’t dis-
cuss the namesof the schools being
considered for expansion, he did say
Penn State had no bearing on the
discussions. “Some of the athletic
directors talked to Penn State a
while ago, and they’re not even being
considered.”

- The other mosti oft-mentioned‘

ion, recentlypitched in $l0,000 to

league and keep on attending the
meetings and keep on downplaying
its interest.

Says Myslinski, “We don’t want
to be the ones breaking up conferen-
ces anywhere, especially the Eastern
8.” That is, no black hats. lt’s also
known as‘ protecting your flanks.
For now, it seems Pitt's athletic
department, with all the business
acumen it can muster, is looking to
ensure that it gets the best possible
deal. That means leaving your door
open for sales pitches.

The proposed Eastern League‘s
spiel, mouthed most loudly by none
other than that crafty canvasser Joe
Paterno_, Penn State’s Athletic
Director and football coach, is
redundant with-one sweet, sweet
work: money. More money that
anybody is making right now on
their own, especially in the non-
revenue sports , not to mention bas-
ketball and football.

Sports networks like ESPN and
USA Cable are scouring the coun-
tryside for programming, and with
markets in Pittsburgh, New York,
Boston and Philadelphia—four of
the East’s top 10 T V markets——the
television package for a basketball
league alone, featuring Syracuse,
Boston College, Pitt, Penn State,
and Rutgers could in ,a short time
parallel the rapid rise ofthe Big East.
That conference recently signed a $2
million television pact while the
Eastern 8 gleaned nothing at yester-
day's meetings, as expected.

To be sure, there are many stum-
bling blocks, like academ/ic stand-
ards, that must be hurdled before the
proposed league’s consumation, and
the idea of breaking"ex.isting confer-
ence affiliations is a very sensitive
one. Everybody’s trying not to hurt,
anyone’s feelings while helping
themselves,‘ or as Myslinski puts it—-
“it's politics”. '

Case in’ point: Pitt’s name-
dropping Duquesne for considera-

,tion as a member ofthe East’league’s

basketball conference. Of course
Pitt, and probably West Virginia for

that matter, doesn’t relish losing the '

home-and-home annual series with
Duquesne, v a surefire 20,000 and
upwards draw. So Pitt demurely
murmurs Duquesne sporadically
and hopes for the best.

“That’s politics. We mention their
name every once and a while to see
what happens,” Myslinskisaid.

Of course,
Duquesne, which is unlikely, a
steady diet of Syracuse, Boston Col-

lege. Penn State, Rutgers,'and West.

Virginia on Pitt‘s basketball sche-
dule ain’t too bad for the turnstiles.

Discussions about the proposed
Easternileague will resume July 2|-
23 when all eight; schools are
expected to attend an East Coast
Athletic Conference (ECAC) get-

together in Cape Cod. Although the

express purpose of the ECAC meet- ’

ing is to entertain some bowl offi-
cials and lobby for some bowl tie-ins
for Eastern football teams, like the
PAC—8 or Big I0 now enjoy, the
athletic directors will also meet
separately for more detailed discus-
sions of the formation of an Eastern
league and could even decide to go
ahead with its creation.

This time when Myslinski walks

through the door at Cape Cod, he‘ll_

be expected.

WVU names AD...

West Virginia University named
former football coach Gene Corum
acting assistant athletic director
Monday replacing Dick Martin,
who resigned after the disclosure of
questionable financial problems in
the department.

Corum, who says he is not being
considered for the permanent
appointment, will retain the post
until a fulltime athletic director is
found. Corum has been assistant
dean of physical education at WVU
since I978 and coached Mountain-
eer football from l960through I965.

Martin's resignation followed the
discovery of questionable ﬁnance

‘managing in the WVU athletic
department. An investigation and
audit of thedepartment was ordered
by the West Virginia Legislature
June I6 after a series of articles
appeared in, the Morgantown
Dominion-Post detailing the
department's expenditures.

The Dominion-Post said it found
receipts from the account of the
Mountaineer Illustrated, a program
sold at WVU football and basketball
games, had been used fora variety of
personal expenses by athletic
‘department officials.

The investigation is still

,. underway.

Occupying the seats often
reserved for prime ministers, sena-
tors and presidents were New York
Yankee owner George Stéinbrenner
and New York Mets player repre-
sentative Rusty Staub.

Staub and Steinbrenner’s com-
ments concerning the current major
league players’ strike, now in its 27th
day, were as wide apart as the cur-
rent negotiations seem to be.

Staub reiterated the players’ feel-
ings that the owners are out to break
the player union and make the ath-
letes suffer through the strike while
the owners collect their insurance
money.

Regarding the outlook fora quick
settlement, Staub characterized the
players’ and owners’ positions as far
apart. “They’re just on two different
planets," Staub said.

Steinbrenner, not surprisingly,
disagreed with most of Staub’s
opinions.

Steinbrenner said that ,“nobody
he knows in baseball” wants .to

‘break the union and that, as far as

he’s concerned, “we (the owners)
didn’t create a strike.” I

Steinbrenner added that he feels
“the issues in the players’ strike can
be brought to a head very quickly“
and he advocated getting the season
underway again soon,‘
