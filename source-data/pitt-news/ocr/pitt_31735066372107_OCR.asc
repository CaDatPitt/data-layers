Lawyers And Architects To Blame For C

Schenley Hall   Renovation Delay 

By SETH LU BOVE

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt's failure to take into account a
l9l3 contracting law when inviting

construction bids on the student ~~

union renovations was an “over-
sight”. on the part of the attorneys
and architects working on the pro-
ject, according to a senior adminis—/
tration official. :
Jack Freeman, senior vice chan-
cellor for administration, said, “Our
attorneys and the architects were
simply not—aware of that particular
requirement.”
The requirement. Freeman
referred to, the Separation _Act of
19 l 3, requires that construction pro-
jects using public funds must open
the competitive bidding process to at
least four types of contractors (elec-
trical, plumbing, etc.). I
Pit-t had invited nine general con-
tractors to submit bids before the
deadline of last Thursday. The uni-
versity would have had 30 days to
select the contractor, which would
have then hired and supervised the
other contractors. ,
But after being informed by Ed
Richey, executive director of the
Mechanical Contractors Associa-
tion of”Western Pennsylvania lnc.,
that it may have been in violation of’
the law, Pitt decided to postpone the
opening of the bids for approxi-
mately 60 days. The bidding will
now be open to five types ofcontrac-
tors: general construction, heating,
ventilation, ‘and air conditioning,
plumbing, electrical, and elevator
installation. _
Now, Freeman said, coordination
of the different contractors will
either have to be managed by Pitt’s'

physical plant department, or bythe
general construction contractor.
George Simmons, project man-

_ ager of the renovations, estimated

that the redesigning of the architec-v
tual plans to conform with the dif-
ferent contractors may cost between
$4,000 and $5,000. Freeman esti-

I matedthe cost to be slightly lower,

between $3,000 and $4,000.

“It's simply that we're dealing in ’

an area in which we had no expe-
rience, ” Freemantsaid, referring to

Two Workshops Planned I
During Literary ,Weel<     \

Assistant News Editor

One fifth of the adult population
in America is functionally illiterate;
they cannot‘ read past a fifth grade
level. _ ' .

In response to this alarming statis-
tic, the Western Psychiatric Institute

‘ and Clinic isholding two workshops

this week in conjunction with World
Literacy Week, which is sponsored
by‘ the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organiza-
[ion (UNESCO).

Meliza Jackson, Patients‘ Librar-

ian and Coordinator of Literacy‘

Project at Western Psych, said the
purpose of th'e,worksho'p is to high-
light the fact that “in an affluent
country, like America, there are so
many illiterates," as well as to recruit
tutors. ‘ ’

The two—day workshop will
instruct prospective tutors how to
teach illiterates to read, Jackson

Allegheny County Higher Educa-

The authority, formed earlier this

Pitt Hosts Free Measles Vaccinations    

By MIKE MALLINGER

Pitt News Staff Writer

University Health Services and
the Allegheny .County Health
Department aretrying to avoid a,
possible measles and rubella out-
break by organizing vaccinations for

students in the 17- to I9-year-old age

group. '

The health services is sponsoring a
free immunization clinic in Forbes
Quadrangle on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1,

 and the county health department

will administer the i-nnoculations.
The precautions are being taken

- as a result ofia large number of'mea-
- sles outbreaks occuring among high

school students.

Other students, staff and adminis-
trators who come in contact with the
disease maycontract it, but Sandy
Doster, of the _Center for Disease
Control, said, “The older you get,
the chances that you have had the

- disease in the past is greater.”

Doster added that the govern-
ment is trying to completely elimi-
nate the nine-day strain of measles
"by Oct. I. I982, and asks those indi-
viduals who have been vaccinated
before I967, before I2 months of
age, or those whose history is not
known, to be revaccinatcd.

Yet Jan Devoe, nurse health edu-
cator at Pitt, thinks that an epidemic
could reach the larger community.

I

“l,don’t think we could contain
it,” she said, referring to an epidemic .
at Pitt.

Devoe cited a report that des-
cribed 20 percent of Air Force‘
Academy freshmen as susceptibleto

’ measles and'German measles. A

There is also adanger, she said, of
exposing pregnant women torubella
who risk having deformed babies as
a result. it _

itself, but the complications that can
go along wﬁh the disease,” she
added. Those contracting nine-day
measles ‘risk brain infection or
death, _ ' j ‘

Margaret Cavanugh, a public

health nurse forvthe county, esti- _

mated \the immunizations per-
formed would total between 10 and
100.

“We could do more than that,”
she said.‘

 

She urged individuals ,to obtain
the vaccines because “there’s always

.the’possibili_ty for one reason" or

another that the mother did not get
that immunization for her child.”
Measles and rubella vaccines may
cause fever and a rash five days to
two weeks after injection. I
“It's not anything that you need to
be concerned about. Maybe you’d
run a fever for a day or two, then it
goes away,” Cavanugh said.

. By ALAN ZAVACKY

Special to The PM News

It was about l0 o’clock on a warm summer evening as l pasted
another advertisement on the wall of a garbage—like building serving
no discernible purpose called “The Annex.“ As I continued up Bou-
quet Street towards Forbes, two young men in street clothes got out of
a car parked across the street and walkedcasually in my direction.
Sensing these guys aren’t just ordinary “Joes," I stepped up my pace.
noticing they did the same. ‘

“Police officers!” cried the one wearing a mustache, flipping out a
badge from somewhere.

’And the chase was on.

Unwilling to risk a possible fine for such a harmless act (they looked
serious), I fled up Bouquetpursued by the officer sporting the must-
ache. Crossing Forbes, ljuked my way around several moving vehi-
cles including a campus police car that came to a screeching halt.
Then, sprinting up a set of concrete steps, over the Towers’plateau
and down again, I figured the officer had given up the chase; after all it
was a mere poster violation, right? Nothing doing. I glanced back over
my shoulder and there he was, trailing me at a distance. I guessed this

_ _ _ ' guy was desperate for some action—possibly the most exciting inci-

- - . . Q:  .. 3 . " dent all summer. \ ‘

Burning across Fifth Avenue and over a vacant parking lot, I turned up University Placewhere, exhausted, I ducked‘ into some bushes

., growing in front ofa building there. Evidently the officer saw me go in. “He’s in the bushes,“ he shouted. As l laid on my stomach, I heard a
car pull in at the curb and then an announcement: “l’m going in after him.” It was more ridiculous than dramaiic. Eventually after being
bullied around a bit and then handcuffed, l was apprehended. Obviously, l thought to myself, not enough excitement this summer and
perhaps too many Starsky and Hutch programs. , - t i

At the campus station, the cuffs were removed and l waslocked inside a small foi1r—sided cubicle, newly painted in white. 1 gathered it was
here, in the late hours, that confessions were made under the bright lights and intense psychological strain. I waited it ou_t while the officers
ran a check on their latest collar. . .

Some twenty or thirty minutes passed before the door was unlocked and l was ordered to empty my pocketsjat the office desk.

“What do you do with this?" questioned one of the officers examining the pocket knife I hadjust laid on the desk.

“Open letters mostly,” I answered. ‘’

“Yea, uh huh,” he continued in a tone of disbelief, insinuating that l slit -tire or threatened people with it.

Then the officer with the mustache walked over to me and said, “You know, t at was a stupid thing to do,” implying that l was about to
regret it. y.

“Yea, a stupid thing to do,“ reaffirmed his sidekick. T

‘‘A stupid thing to do,” repeated the first officer. Now, having heard this line delivery three consecutive times, I surmised that this scene had
been rehearsed before that the two officers had waited all summer to use it. '

By this time I had realized that l wasn’t about to be let off easy.

a “We're going downtown,” said one of the officers with finality.

“Ever been downtown?” asked.his sidekick.

“Yea," I replied, “l go down there all the time.”

“No, no, no!” exclaimed the officer impatiently. “l meanthe Public Safety Building."

“Oh no,” I said, ‘_‘l’ve never been there.”

“Yea, I bet,” he replied incredulously.

“its your decision," 1 said aloofly. So the cuffs were reaffixed and we were off to the city police station.

After a few formalities down at the station, Twas taken to the entrance ofa long corridor and told to enter the first cell to my left. Upo
entering. the cell door locked itself electrically with a .slam that resounded down the corridor. l was fairly impressed. ’

Anyway I eventually appeared before the magistrate. Waiving my right to an attorney .(bail was fifty dollars), I explained in my own
defense what a mockery ofjustice and waste oftime this entire ordeal had been. I went on to explain that I had not resisted arrest but merely
fled from the possibility of being arrested for something that in my mind was not a crime. A commendable defense l thought, but to no avail.
The magistrate was not about to allow his time, along with the time ofthe officers, to go for naught; thus l was fined the minimum thirty—six
dollars total. _ ~ ‘

“Do you have‘the money on you to cover the cost of the fine?" asked the magistrate.

' “No,” lianswered (I could barely cover it in my account). “Will you take a check?"
- “Cash only," he replied, “You‘ll have to have someone come in with it’. We’re open until four a.m.”

“Pretty good hours," l remarked. -

“Take him away," commanded the judge.

Fortunately, my second telephone call connected with a friend of mine with wheels. I explained the predicament l was in and it didn't take
long; 1 was a free man before the bars closed., ‘

‘ 1' ‘k ‘k ‘k ‘A’ * i ‘k *

Throughout the ordeal, I was skeptical about the legal authority ofthe campus police to arrest, search and detain. Previously I had viewed

campus police forces as mere glorified nightwatchmen. However, this is not the case at Pitt. Employed by the university under “private

’ police” status, the Pitt police wield pretty much the sameauthority as municipal police so long as they do not exceed university limits.
\University limits, however, include some 53 buildings spread throughout Oakland enabling campus police to potentially exert a wide range
of discretionary authority. V A ' ’

According to Jim Waters, Lieutenant of Administrative Services, the Pitt police force underwent a majortransformation during the early
"705 (back when campus activism was still kicking nationally) toward a"more professional system“. Today the department comprises some 56
patrol officers and twenty commissioned supervisors organized in a hierarchy. Waters boasted that the Pitt force is approximately the fourth
largest in Allegheny County operating seven days a week, 365 days a year.

‘As you‘ve probably noticed, the campus police may be equipped with firearms and other weapons: they also attend the same training 0
schools as the municipal police. Like the municipal police, there is no educational requirement necessary to become an officer. While the age

« requirement is l8, no campus policeman is under the age of 2|. '

Interaction between the campus and municipal police departments does occur. According to Waters, the two forces sometimes collaborate
in criminal cases affecting both the city and the university. lnterestingly enough, the two departments are further linked by the fact that
members of one force have switched over and joined the other.

And there you have it, a little information concerning the Pitt Campus Police; people who are not mere “glorified nightwatehmcn" but
rather take themselves quite seriously (perhaps too seriously); a force whose duty is to protect that university property scattered throughout
the Oakland area, thereby affecting both the student and nonstudent populace by its mere armed presence. if i

“The university started develop-
ing plans and programs for the stu~
dent union a long time ago, and at
the time we started, the Higher Edu-
cation Assistance Authority hadn’t

/been established yet," said John.

A Vrana, assistant vice chancellor for
business and finance. .
Despite the setback. Freeman
conceded that a poor bond market
for the type of bonds Pitt would
have obtained may have resulted in a
delay regardless of the oversight.
“We would, even if the bids had
come in, have had to look at the
bond market anyway. And fr:inl<ly.l
think that in the long run we
wouldn’t be able to go to the bond
market at thistime anyway because
of the state of the economy. And so
another month (of delay) or so-' is
likely to create a better situation for
us,” Freeman said. '
Freeman added that the univer~
sity is not embarrassed because of
the oversight. despite this being the
first time Pitt has used the county‘
authority.
“A delay of this sort on a project
of this sort is not all that unusualsl

,~don’t perceive any embarrassment..

lt‘s unfortnate that we didn’t know

about it (the contracting law), but I

it’s no big deal. In the future we’ll
draw the original specifications in
the other projects that we do to con-
form with it.”

Labor Day is a red letter newsday ‘
Blue Monday doesn’t come-until Tuesday
5Ogden Nash

Labor is making news these days. _

We're in the midst of an air traffic controllers’ strike’. The
Allegheny County teachers are threatening to walk out, and
Philadelphia’s teachers already have. Even here at Pitt,
faculty membersihave made attempts to unionize-

While President Reagan was hailed in soriie circles for his
Labor Day promise of more jobs, he was assailed by thou-
sands of others who marched in favbr of the striking con-
trollers in New York City’s first Labor Day parade.
lronically, the President was in New York that day, present-
ing Mayor Ed Koch with a federal grant of $85 million for a
highway project on Manhattan’s west side. It was his hope,
Reagan told a _small gathering, that economic programs such
as the Manhattan highway project would usher in a new age
of American worker, an age that would create 3_million more
jobs by I986 in addition to the I0 million already expected in
his program. ‘ ' E P

But if there was any message that came loud and clear on
Labor Day l98l, it was from "PATC.O President Robert
Poli, who told marching controllers and nearly l50,000
other labor supporters that their first parade was “a message
to everyone in this country, including the administration, of
our resolve and solidarity."

AFL-C10 President Lane Kirkland echoed Poli’s message
of labor solidarity by scoffing at Reagan’s pledge to generate
more jobs through his economic programs. “His actions
speak a lot louderthan his words," said Kirkland, estimating
the loss of 1.25 million jobs through federal budget cuts.

' ‘But if there was one unspoken message delivered to the
country this past Labor Day, it was that firm labor still
does—-and, for some time to come, will—-enjoy a gripon the
‘balance of power that has swung its way over the past few.
decades.  » _

We need not go far back in our history to find the roots of’

- labor solidarity. Our grandparents, and even some of our
own parents, have lived through the horrors of l2-hour day

a sweatshops or theunsafeworking conditions of the coal
mines and the steel.mills. The spirit of solidarity fostered by
early labor leaders lives todayin those who fought J. P.
Stevens and brownﬂlung, or_the Karen Silkwoods who fight
the new and ever-present dangers of the nuclear energy
business. ‘ '

A question develops, however, iftheairtraffic controllers, ,
the Philadelphia teachers and the thousands of labor strikers
that picket in this country every year are true to the spirit of
the early unionizers. is it a part ofunion policy, for example,
for Philly teachers to strike when lowered enrollment and
fiscal crisis make teacher layoffs necessary‘? While it is part of
American tradition for workers to enjoy the benefits oftheir
contribution to the company, is it also traditional to ask for
wages that succeed in forcing the corporation into bank-
ruptcy‘? This’ hardly seems like progress for the American
worker.

So, every Labor Day, we honor the most ageless of
national treasures. We honor it with caution. however, as we
look ahead to the most dangerous years of the unions’
turbulent history. ~ ' ‘

Bowing to the Employment G0d

, By MARK COLLINS

Pitt News Staff Writer

lf‘Adam Smith had a god, his
name would be resume. ,
No other employment device has

the mystical power. No matter what ‘

your qualifications are, the Perfect’
Resume will get you that Perfect
Job. Or so l’ve heard: my experience
in job hunting has shown lousy
results with or without this
document. P

What’s alarming, though, is the
lengths to which prospective
workers will go in lying about them-
selves. At first, -the novices are
embarrassed about their little white
lies: ‘‘3.() QPA” when the truth is
clos_er to 2.8; “maintenence engi-
neer” is a kind -euphemism for.jani-
tor. But, with time and lack of
results, the mendacity deepens. Sud-

ing the personnel manager that he

‘ had l4 minors, and made dean’s list

taking care of his sick mother. lfthis
still fails. the cornered applicant will
claim to be a personal friend ofthe
Rockefellers, and hint at the caliber
of golf that Nelson .used to play at
the club. This is serious.‘

There is also, of course, the
mechanics ofthe resume itself. Com-
panies now offer to do the resume
for you, or to typeset it, or to pack-

age it, or to “improve” upon it. l’ve ,

seen these places operate, and I can-
not believe that any employer would
be fooled _by a resume on pink paper
dotted with asterisks and typesetting
lines. It becomes obvious that this
person isn’t just asking for a job-
she’s groveling. -

But who arewe tojudge? Deceit is
not inborn, but learned, from the
first time your mother asks who

tion breeds this. From the innocent

all part of an insidious pattern of

perjury. The grammar-school type is
to avoid embarrassment in front of
peers; at the collegiate level, deceit is
used to save your tuition money and.
of course, to look good on the
resume.

Perhaps we could do away with
transcripts and record cards and
resumes and ‘return to an arbitrary
system of hiring. Those were the
glory days, it wasn't whatyou knew
you but who you knew, discrimina-
tion ran rampant, and every‘ busi-
ness move was crooked and illegal.
On sure, it still happens today,’ but
employers are much more open
about it than before. Let’s put deceit
back in the closet where it belongs.

Editor

' Reader,M._W. of Shadyside wrote
to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
recently to let off some steam about
the canon of journalistic integrity,

The National Inquirer. “While it’s r

true that it prints stories not always
based on facts, the stories are enter-
taining,” the. enraged crusader
wrote. ‘

Hey, but so was Janet Cooke's fun
piece on the kiddiejunkie. The letter
brought up, an interesting point,

. though-—if we are to fudge on the

truth in favor of entertainment, why
limit the practice only to media?

The annual fall onslaught of
freshmen makes it clear that Pitt—
already known for being quick to act
on hot- ideas, like the rush to com-
puterize registration——embraces this
philosophy in the recruitment and
training new students. And what a
market. Thousands of freshly-
scrubbed faces, coming to a school
that has more stop signs on its sur-
rounding streets, than in their entire
towns.

Like any good university, Pitt sets
out to explain Life at Pitt to the
youngsters, in assorted catalogues,
handbooks, and pamphlets. Here's
where the entertainment part comes
in.

Take the dorms. All these kids sit
in their spacious rooms at home, a

shag rug under their feet, and pile of , _  _

bed beside them. They are reading a’
pamphlet from Pitt extolling the
virtues of dormitory living. The text
hardly mentions the small rooms,
impossible roommates, and’ trash-
filled stairways-that they are about
to experience.

lt‘s too bad Pitt went for the enter-
tainment angle here. Becoming
adjusted to living away from home is
difficult enough without telling

‘someone you it will be the best expe-'

rience of your life. Imagine if Pitt
had just laid it on the line--you
know, sent something that said:

Dear Kid.
If you think being stuffed on a
floor with 40 people you don’t
- know is going to be a bed of roses,
you‘re crazy. But, like it or not,
that‘s how it is. So learn from it.
Respect other people's time and pri-
vacy. Don’t blast your stereo at 3
a.m. and yur neighbor won't host
the local bands in his room during
ﬁnals week. And get over the
vandalism-is-fun stage. After sev-
eral months of shoving aside half-
eaten Big Macs to get down the
stairs, being rude and inconsiderate
won't give you the kicks it oncedid.
Signed,
Pitt
In the interest of diplomacy, tact,
etc., it's highly unlikely Pitt would
ever send a letter like that to a pros-
pective student. But the point re—' i
mains that painting an accurate pic-
ture of how things are here would be

courses they’ve learned something,
or even that they’ll be happy here.
The danger in this whole
Pittsburgh-goes-Hollywood bit can
be compared to the governments
anti-marijuana campaign of a few
decades back. Talk about backlash.

‘ When millions of Americans found

out that they didn’t become ax-
murderers afterthey smoked ajoint,
any legitimate government warnings

dutifully ignored.

The lesson here is the same. Pitt

far enough, you might even add that if

it’s a fine university. But that doesn’t
give it the right to overlook its faults.
By informing new students that
there aren’t any, Pitt becomes vuner—
able to a real credibility problem. If
a new student finds out that every-

thing he’s been told about Pitt

doesn’t measure up. why should he
believe anything he hears, even ifit’s
right on target‘? ~

lt would be ridiculous to suggest I

that Pitt send out brochures; to high
school seniors telling them to go
somewhere else because Pitt is a
lousy place. Its not. But opting fo
the truth might be impressive. Tell
them about the assets and the advan-
tages of going to Pitt. Inform them

would be amazed at the advances
made in nursing. .

But while significant progtess in
the last 100 years has taken nurses
from a position of unskilled laborers
to one of well-educated members of
the professional health team, the tra-
ditional images of nursesias moth-

‘ ers, ‘saints or sometimes ignorant
servants often remain in the minds
of the public.

. These images not only present
obstacles to the development of

‘_‘ nurses as educated, well-paid,
respected and independent practi-i
tioners, but they can also be ﬁngered
as indirect causes ofthe nation's

I nursing shortage.

“Our enrollment has increased
-during the past five years,” says Dr.
‘Enid Goldberg, dean of Pitt’s

School of Nursing. “Our problem is
not with declining enrollments but
with limiting admissions.”

The undergraduate nursing pro-
gram is not cost-effective; that is, the
$ l ,30O tuition that each student pays

per term does not cover the pro- _

gram, according to Gbldberg. The
increased revenue brought in by an
overenrollment not only raises the
costs of running the program but
also affects the quality of education.
‘\ “Our faculty can’t teach nursing
.just in a classroom -—we has/e to have
faculty in the field as well,”.explains
T Goldberg, who.notes that this stum-
bling block is where a majority ofthe
programs costs originate. “If you
don’t control admissions, then the
quality of education is lost when a
faculty member has to supervise 20

. studentslin a clinical setting."

While Pitt’s School of Nursingis
considered by many to be one ofthe

best in the country. Goldberg syas r

she doesn‘t believe in ratings.

Although there has never been an
adequate supply of nurses since the
Depression, many of the nation’s
hospitals are experiencing severe
shortages for the first time. Accord-
ing to the American Hospital Asso-
ciation, hospitals today are unable
to fill an estimated 100,000 positions
with registered nurses.

"The nursing shortage is --most
severe in the hospital or acute care
setting, "explains David Ranck, the
associate executive director of the
Pennsylvania Nurses Association.

 

“A survey conducted last year by the ,

Hospital Association of Pennsylva-
nia, in which 60 percent ofthe state 3'

‘hospitals responded, found that
there were 2. 700 unﬁlled nursing.

positions.

t Pitt’s Nursing School,
   The Nursing Turnover

However, adds Goldberg, “lifeel
the school does have one ofthe best

is due to the marvelous clinical faci-
lities in the University Health Cen-
ter.”

In the past, Pitt nursing graduates
who took their state boards had a
low failure rate (under three percent)
and exceeded both the state and

national mean scores. Goldberg says -

she is anxious _to‘learn how the Class
of 1981 did on its boards becausethe
class was the first one to graduate
since a change in the school’s curri-
culum was implemented.

The curriculum change came in
part as a response toithe medical
field‘s expansion in the areas'oftech-
nology and preventive medicine.-

_:‘We've been taught to assess the
patient both physically and men-
tallyf”. says Debbie Krawczyk. a
senior nursing student. “We take
care of the total patient.”

While ‘A the curriculum has
expanded to include patient assess-
ments, the basic principles behind
the program stressing responsibility
and independence have remained

intact. “One of the most important‘

things, l think, is responsibility."
says Tracy Seecof, another senior
nursingstudent. “I'm responsible for
my ‘own actions. and if something
isn’t right‘, l‘ll question it.” _
Krawczyk addsithat she believes
a wide range of opportunities in the

field. .
“We‘ll beable to assume more

responsibilities because of our back-
ground," shesays. “Although it may
bean uphiil battle. l definitely see
more opportunities in nursing.”
When Debbie,’ Tracy and the
other I24 students in their nursing
class graduate next spring, they will
be entering a field-where the national

Ranck predicts,” as do many oth-
ers in the field, that the shortage will
get worse before it gets better since
the demand for skilled nursing has
continued to rise while nursing

been declining for the past five years.

mated at 40 percent by the American
Nursing Association. ,-

Several recent studies on this
problem reveal that nurses attribute
their job dissatisifaction to a lack of -
autonomy, little respect from physi-
cians, limited opportunity for
advancement, low’s5laries and over-
whelming workloads created by the

.. current nursing shortage. ’ .

The traditionally limited respon-
sibilities and decision-making power
of nursing are not meshing with the

Q.

/expectations‘of today’s nurses, who

are becoming increasingly educated,
experienced and professional.

T While a study by University of
Iowa -sociologists found that turn-
over rates were reduced in small
Midwest, hospitals that increased
nurses’ ‘participation in‘ decision-
making autonomy, for nurses con-/-

tinues to be a problem in mosti~

hospitals.

a

Nurses believe they have a signifi- _ _

cant contribution to make in health
care, but many find that their input

is not valued by some physicians.‘

‘Yet, although there are still some

"doctors whoiexuect nurses to stand
in their presence, collaboration be-

tween physician and nurse i§becom-
ing more c'o'mmor'1 due to the efforts
of the National Joint Practice Com-
mission.

Another contributing factor to
the high nursing turnover rate is the
limited opportunity for advance-

. ment in the hospital setting. Becom-

ing a specialist such as a nurse
practitioner or a nurse-midwife
requires an advanced degree. leaving
an administration job as theonly
door still open for future advance-
ment. Often a staff nurse, after five
years or 40 years. is still a staff nurse
with’ the. same restrictions and
‘rotations.

Nurses’ dissatisfaction with salar-
ies stems not only from low wages
but also from the inequity of base
pay‘ and the absence of economic
rewards for job experience.

. The latter discrepancies were
noted in a University of Texas at
Austin study, which found that the
mean annual salary for RNs with
less than five years of experience in
Texas was ,$l4,000, while the~mean
salary for RNs with 40 years ofexpe-
rience was only $l8,000.

Although the nursing shortage
has caused starting salaries to rise
dramatically in some areas ($17,000
in some Philadelphia hospitals and

$19,000 in_,a San Francisco hospi- .

tal), it is also responsible for the
vicious circle that adds pressures to
the nursing career and prompts
more nurses to leave. 0

AiLook Ahead

Solutions to the nursing shortage
and the problems it has spawned.
range from practical to idealistic.

The unionization of nurses, which
first became legal in 1975, is gaining
strength in the nursing profession.
Collective bargaining‘ is viewed by
some nurses as a means of economic
upgrading and acknowledgment of
their contributions.

~ “In the next 10. years, we’re going
to see thousands of nurses/ move
through collective bargaining to
resolve problems,” Ranck says. “In
addition, many labor unions, which
see hospital workers as the most
available group to organize, will
push this.” .

While some in the nursing field see
union membership as being contrary
to professionalism, Ranck contends_
that it is the only option open to
nurses who, when dealing with hos-
pital management, are given “no
control over their destiny.”

He also attributes the wide accep-
tance of nursing unionization to the

growing number of‘baccalaureate A

nurses “socialized to participate in
decision-making” and are amicable
to collective bargainig.

An older, perhaps sexist solution
proposed to elevate the profession is

' to attract malesminto the field._

“I don’t think the "shortage issue
will open up the field significantly-to
males,_” Ranck says, noting that only
2 percent of the state’s 90,000
licensed nurseséaremale. “If, you
look at nursing’s history, there has
always been a shortage, only this
time the media has picked up on it.”

One solution designed to get to
the roots of the shortage problem is
recruitment.

Unrealistic job expectations are
often cited as reasons why nurses
leave their job during the first six
‘months. Hospitals often contribute
to this delusion by making such

' claims as “she came to our hospital

and lived happily ever after” and “I
dreamed of a job like this" in nurse
recruitment ads.

‘“Most "large hospitalsu employ a
nurse to specifically recruit new‘
graduates,” says Barbara Christy,
director of surgical nursing at Pitts-
burgh’s Presbyterr_ian—University
Hospital. “What often happens is

that her experiences, as she relates

them to hopeful recruits, are not true
to the hospital experience because
she’s been away from it.”

‘Christy says that recruitment of
nurses to Presby is uniquebecause it
isgdone by a team that consists of}
nursing directors and staff nurses.
According to’ Christy, this arrange-

ment allows a student to get “a more .
realistic picture of the hospital.“
Another solution that has been
suggested as ’a means to unifyainda
raise the profession’s standards is a
resolution proposed by the Ameri-
can Nurses Association to requireai
baccalaureate degree forithose who

enter" professional’ nursing. "

Although l985 is targeted as the year
to put the resolution into effect,
many feel it won’t be implemented’

until at least l990.

“No, the resolution won’t go into
effect in 1985; however, many states
have s.tarted to follow it,” Ranck
says. “The diploma program has
outlived itself in many states west of
the -Mississippi. California, for
instance, only has one diploma
school left.”

V Ranck says diploma schools,
where nursing students study‘ and
work in a‘l"rsopital fontwo or three

years, still flourish in the East, where ’

education is more 'traditional and_
rigid. __ _ ” q _
“Today’s nursing student needs

 i clinical experience in more than one

hospital if he or she is to cope,” says
Goldberggan avid supporter of the
resolution. “He or she also needs
that liberal arts component.”

‘ Further, she points out that all the

other professions in thehealth field, . 

such as medical technology and
physical therapy, require a bacca-“
laureate degree.

Although the future of nursing is
uncertain, a strong,.underlying sense
of optimism persists.

“lfa nurse is a/t_a higher level than
the profession, then she can choose’
to act to raise the profession’s level
of developinent,” writes Dr. Jean"

Watson, a professor ofnursinf at 

the University. of Colairado. “This

person’ can eontribute to both her; 

own growth and theprofession’s.”

I would hope that a person would 

not be turned off byinursing as a

Flanker Barry Compton came back from serious off-
season Knee surgery to grab five passes, for a team- *

high 80 yards,‘ in Saturday's Pitt defeat of Illinois.

Down, Not Out-
Compton is Back

BY AMIN GHOSSEIN

Assistant Sports Editor

Amid the swarm of reporters
around his locker, Barry Compton
appeared lost. He was not as adept at
fielding questions thrown to him left
and right as were some of the more
celebrated Panthers. He nervously
swayed back and forth and seemed
to be thinking, “What’s all the fuss
about?” i

‘There was plenty to fuss about.

A year ago, Compton had sur-
prised many Panther followers by
being Pitt's starting ﬂanker on open-
ing day. While more talented pass-
catchers abounded on the ’80 team,
none worked harder and fiercerthan
Compton during Pitt’s first offen-
sive series.

But in one play of last season,
Compton went down. The diagno-

‘ sis? Torn’ knee ligaments. The open-

ing day that he had been looking for-
ward to so much was ruined.

The injury was so serious that it
required surgery. But even worse,
doctors thought Compton would
never play collegiatefootball again.

Medical opinions do not, how-
ever, take into account the size of a
man‘s heart. Judging by Saturday's
performance, Compton‘s heart is
about as big as they come.

«All Compton did was haul in a
game-high five catches for 80 yards,
also tops for the game. Yet Compton
did not accept the performance with
the usually anticipated .'jsigile and

self-centered rambling on about his
ability. His calm approach was a
challenge to the journalists who
hoped to find out how it felt to come
back from the football graveyard.
Compton‘ is a throwback to days
past; he does not shy away from
hard work. He just didn’t seem to
understand why everyone was mak-
ing such a big deal about last year’s
injury and his subsequent return to
form against lllinois. ,
“You know, injuries are a part of
the game. That’s football. The doc-
tors told me l wouldn’t be back, but I
worked hard," Compton said. His
dedication obviously paid off
because, after his performance Sat-
urdaygas a backup fora slightly in-
jured Dwight Collins, Coach Jackie
Sherrill may use a revisedsetup on
offense to take advantage of Comp-

ton’s skills. Sherrill is seriously con-
sidering using a lineup with four’

wide‘ receivers, one of them being
Compton. ‘

While Compton’s fellow receivers
were playing hot potato with the
football last Saturday. Compton
was treating the pigskin as ifit were a
priceless jewel-never taking his eye
off it and making sure his hands
were around it before running across
the gridiron. A

The knee? It is a mere after-
thought in Compton's mind. .

“I felt a little unsure about it going
into fall camp, but I've got my confi-

dence back,” Compton said; f‘l don‘t .

even think about it any mote."

characterized Pitt’s young, enthusiastic defense Saturday against Illinois.

The Kids are A|lright——
Pitt Defense PassesT

Pitt Defense ‘
.By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Sports Editor

The kids are all right.

The Pitt Panther’s young defense,
already revamped and re-staffed,
came through its first test reborn in
'fine tradition, thanks to a soothing
performance for the 46,022 faithful
and more than a few anxiety-ridden
Panther coaches at Pitt Stadium
Saturday, as Pitt was drubbing the
University of Illinois’ Fighting lllini
26-6. v ’ ’

In limiting the lllini to 252 total
yards, ‘including just 48 net yards
rushing on 33 tries, the Panther

defense erased much of the _doubt V

surrounding their totally rebuilt def-
ensive line and a cast of heretofore

"unknown starters. The effort also ‘

eased the minds of a few coaches
who, before the-game, each in his
own way, were losing itlone way or
the other.

Pitt. defensive coordinator Foge

Fazio, who can still remember the
intoxicating visions of Hugh Green
and Ricky Jackson patrolling the
field for nation’s No. 1 defense, was
suffering from an emotional han-

. ‘players, you know?

gover of sorts before Saturday's
game. One too many graduated
“it was a nervous situation. This
year, unlike last year, we didn‘t
know what to expect,” Fazio said. ‘fl
told one of the guys after the game, I
must have lost 6 pounds sweating it
out up in the booth. There was a lot
of anxiety and anticipation. I guess
the unexpected does worry you.”
Asked to characterize the best
thing about the game, Fazio replied,
‘-‘We won. And l‘m ‘glad its over.”
Panther head coach Jackie Sher-

»rill,‘ meanwhile, was also suffering

from some pre-game jitters, a sur-
prisingly far cry from his usually
placid demeanor. Shortly after the
game, Sherill confided to reporters
he had found it necessary to,
uh...clear his stomach before the
game. Sherill, worried?

“l didn’t know what the hell to
expect," Sherill said.

As first games go, what the

coaches got was a young defense
that throttled the lllini offense, reco-
vered three fumbles, pressu-red the
quarterback most of the afternoon
and even capped the Pitt scoring
thanksto a fourth-quarter safety by
Pan_ther_ Bill/Maas.

Roth Photo

“I think we showed a lot of quick-
ness, and we played intelligently,”
Fazio said. “We made a few mis-
takes but not as many as l thought
we would. If -lllirR>is had gotten
ahead of us and vile had fumbled the
ball away, it may have been differ-
ent.”

In other words the baptism
expected to come by“ fire came,

rather,by the “flare”-Illinois‘.

vaunted “ﬂar‘e-ﬂood” offensive sys-
tem. Over the course of the game, it
rarely varied and rarely worked. The
lllini offense floundered——Ton.y

Eason dumped off morejunk to the I,

running backs than a landfill getsin

several days. In both cases, the fal-

lout gleans little substance.

Eason, the junior college quarter-‘

back in his first major college start,

proved convincingly that he is not
yet cut out from the same cloth as his W

lllinois predecessor Dave "Wilson,
last year’s record-setting passer.

The lllini seem to be collegiate ‘J

football's aerial answer to the old

Woody Hayes “3 yards and a cloud '
ofdust” syndrome. The lllini version ‘i

Saturday was their epitaph.

“You could see their game plan
was to dump to the backs. They were
worried about our blitzes, even

Posvar: No Finol QK On-CiFA,Leogue

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Sports Editor ,

Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar
Saturday denied published
reports that Pitt has officially
decided to support the formation
of a new Eastern sports league
and the ratification of the Colle-
giate Football Association‘s
recently negotiated NBC televi-
sion contract. ‘

“That js completely untrue.’
We have made no final decision
on either item yet," Posvar said,
shortly after Pitt’s game with llli-
nois at Pitt Stadium. “We main-
tain our position the same as
before, that we're willing to listen
to any discussions and keep the
door open." \

C The report, which ran in
Saturday's edition of the ems’-
rburgh Post-Gazette, quoted a

w 11 ggaggd" so

“Pitt has alreadydecided to sup-
port the formation of the new
league." The article went on to
say that Pitt has also already
decided to support the CFA and
its ‘four-year, $l80 million televi-
sion contract with NBC.

“He (the writer) couldn’t have
gotten that from anyone at Pitt,”
Posvar added. ‘‘That‘s not truel'~'

“Most of’that article is just not
accurate,” Dean Billick, Pitt’
associate director of athletics for
public affairs, said yesterday.
“We have not made any final
decisions. As we’ve said before,
we remain interested in both the I
CFA and the new league, we
intend to pursue it further and
participate in future discussions,
but nothing final has been
decided.“ \_

iiPanther soccer is back and will ,

kick off their 1981 season on Sept. 9
away against Gannon. Pitt soccer
coach Leo" Bemis admits that it,
might take a couple of games for the
offenseto come around.

“We are depending on a lot of new
young players to help us out on
attack,” says Bemis. “The defense
will have to carry us the first couple
of games until our offense can start
producing.”

There are eight returning starters
on the team this year which includes
junior Eric Tiedtke, who led the
team in scoring last year. Tiedtke
will be a key man on this young
offense. He will have to produce for

- the offense to be a success this year.

The strength of this team lies in its.
defense which includes another key
player, senior goalie, Scott'Thun—
berg. If the offense does not score
many goals then Thunberg, who had
four shutouts last season, may have
to repeat his last-season heroics to
keep the Panthers in games. '

The team has a lot of depth in the
midfield and forward lines. Coach
Bemis plans to substitute a lot at
these positions so he can find out

who can produce the goals that this 7

team will need. Last season, after
rocketing to a 7-2 start, the Panther
offense faltered and the team fin-
ished 7-8.

There are no injury problems
going into the beginning of the sea-
son. lfthe Panthers can stay healthy,
Bemisthienks that they are capable of
winning‘ the West Penn Conference
title. won last year by Indiana, Slip-
pery Rock and Grove City. Despite
only two weeks of practice and a
large roster to sift through, includ-
ing 28 recruits, Bemis says that his
team should be ready for its opening
game against Gannon.

Goals in the net and finding
that winning combination will be
on the minds of the Pitt soccer
team as they open their season
today at Gannon College.

Coach Bemis is very optimistic
and sees no reason why the boot-
ers won’t return without a
victory. .

“We’re ready for Gannon,” he
said. “They have some good
players returning and some out-
standing recruits, but we're capa-
ble of beating them.”

in order to win, the Pitt Scor-
.ers must find the net. Junior win-
ger Eric Tiedtke‘ is the only
consistent scorer returning from

last year’s squad, but he hasn’t
yet regained his scoring touch in
preseason scrimmages. Tiedtke
received zi slight knee injury in
Sunday’s scrimmage against
Alderdice. If that doesn’t affect
his play, Tiedtke should begin to
put the ball-in the net as he did
last year, when he led the team in
scoring.

Sophomore John Pizzella has
looked very good during practice
and in the scrimmages. Pizzella
has good skills and a strong shot.
He is always around the net and
should start scoring the goals.

The team needs at least two or
three consistent scorers in order .
to win games, according to

continued on pagc'_f'I'freen

According to Bemis, the team’s
three major goals this year are to
have a winning season, win the West
Penn Conference, and make it into
the NCAA playoffs.

The Panthers are the only team
in their conference to play their
home games on artificial turf, but
Bemis does not see this as a big

advantage. He said that in the past,‘
visiting teams have adjusted quickly
to the artificial turf because the ball
takes a true bounce and a true roll.

After Gannon, the first home
game for the Panther soccer team
will be Friday, Sept. ii at 7:15 p.m.
