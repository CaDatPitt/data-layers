the room.

Eight heralds, dressed in white,
read from their banners the names
of those who received merit p-anthers
in recognition of their records of
scholarship, co-operation and friend-
liness in their ﬁrst eight weeks at
Pitt. The girls, whose names were
called, took their places to the right
and left of the platform. After the
story of the panther was told by

Parents Attend
Annual Reception

 

Glee Club, Orchestra
Entertain At Affair

Men ’s

   

About 1,000. parents attended the
twelfth annual Chancellor's reception
to parents of freshmen in Memorial
hall Friday evening and heard Dr.
John G. Bowman, Chancellor of the
University, urge greater sympathetic
interest between parents and chil-
dren.

Chancellor Bowman spoke very in-
formally, explaining that the most
important thing a student obtains
from any college is “a sense of super-
iority.” “Don’t try to put a monetary
value on a college education,” he
urged. “A student may attend col-
lege and never make any more money
than he would had he not attended.
The purpose of college is to make for
the student a happier, fuller life—to
give him a sublime signiﬁcance of his
part in the universe.”

While the parents were being es-
corted to the third ﬂoor of the hall,
where they received grade cards, the
Men's Glee club, under the direction
of Dr_ Walter H_ Wright, associate
professor of dentistry, entertained.

One hundred and seventy-ﬁve mem-
bers of the faculty, including the
heads of each department, and one
hundred and ﬁfty student aides were
present to assist in making the re-
ception a success. The llniversity or-
chestra entertained while the guests
were ﬁling into the auditorium.

University A c c ep t s
Nevin ’ s Piano, Music

Mrs, Ethelbert Nevin presented her
composer-husband’s grand piano for 3.
music room in the Cathedral yester-
day afternoon to Chancellor John G.
Bowman. Nevin received the piano in
1880 and did all of his playing on it
as long as he lived in the old family
home, “Vineacre,” in Sewickley. Upon
his father's death in 1908 the piano
was given to the composer’s son,
Paul.

The gift of “The Narcissus” and
nineteen other famous original Ethel-
bert Nevin musical manuscripts, which
were presented to the University last
summer, was announced on the com-
poser’s birthday, last Saturday, No-
vember 25.

Frederic Schaefer, head of the
Schaefer Equipment company and
chairman of the committee for the
Scandinavian room in the Cathedral,
was the donor of the manuscripts.

Golden Panthers
Favorites To Win
Turkey Day Tilt

Sutherland Team Out To Cop
City Title For Fifth
Straight Year

By Robert E. Badger

Tomorrow afternoon at the Stadium
Jock Suther1and’s Panthers ring down
the curtain on their 1933 seasonby
meeting their traditional rivals from
across Panther Hol-
low, the Carnegie
Tech Tartans.
' Pitt’s victory over
_ , Duquesne makes to-
 morrow’s clash a
' ' real city champion-
ship battle. The
Panthers have been
champions of the
City for four con
secutive years now. In 1928 Howard
Harpster, John Karcis, and others on
the great Tech team of that year
handed the Panthers a 6 to 0 defeat.

 

,The Panthers won in 1929, 34 to 13; in

1930, 7 to 0; in 1931, 14 to 6; and
last year, 6 to 0.

The game tomorrow will mark the
closing of the football careers of
seven Panther regulars and seven
strong substitutes. Those ﬁnishing
tomorrow are Mike Sebastian, Howdy
O’Dell, Bob Hogan, Joe Skladany, Tar
Onder, Frank VValton, Dick Matesic,
Jimmy Simms, John Love, John Mere-
dith, Bob Timmons, Art Craft, Frank
Tiernan, and Howard Gelini_

Nine men will be playing their fare-
well game for the Tartans, tomorrow.
They are: Captain Colin Stewart,
Angelo Bevevino, Bunny Burzio,

Clyde Heinzer, Jerry O.’.T.o.ole,,.Henry.

Dreshar, John Sayles, Carl Forsman,
and Joseph Brewster.
To those on the outside the Panthers

will likely be the favorites to beat
the ‘Tartans. To those who know,
however, both teams will go into to-
morrow’s game on even terms. That’s
the way all Pitt-Tech battles are.
Even money, no quarters given, and
none asked.

Much interest has been aroused
about tomorrow’s battle being the in-

itial clash between the youthful How-
ard Harpster and the veteran Jock
Sutherland as rival coaches. Harpster’s
success in checking such national
coaching ﬁgures as Pop Warner, Hunk
iAnderson, and Charley Bachman gives
rise to hope that he will -be able to
cope with the famed Scot.

ed. ,

Pictures of men and women chosen

will be placed opposite the group
pictures of their respective classes
with names impaneled beneath each

Seniors who have proofs of their
Parry pictures are requested to re-
turn the proofs to the studios so that
the senior panel section of the Owl
can be completed, "John Grove said

Wildcat Rallies
Scored As Rumors

Pitt_ And -Tech; Students Urged
To Avoid Wildcat Affairs
For Game Tomorrow

An Editorial

ARNEGIE TECH’S Tartans would
like nothing better than to beat
Pitt tomorrow. V And although we
wish the boys all, the luck in the
world, and although there would be
every reason for a celebration should
such an upset occur, any kind of stu-
dent demonstration would beneﬁt lit-
tle, would cause a great deal of trou-
ble, and would serve to heighten the
dislike of certain downtown gentle-
men for college, oiollege students, and

everything “collegiiate.”

Two delI10llSt3‘al'.iOllS this year
through the llowntown streets
caused considerable ill-feeling,
resulted in damage to property,
and ended witlrf some thirty odd
students in jai1.j Student authori-
ties at both ginstitutions have
failed to take leadership in quell-
ing other possible disturbances,
and administration authorities
could do nothing with students on
an unauthorized; wildcat celebra-
tion. l

ANY RUMORS are ﬂoating

through undergraduate circles
about the probability of a. serious
If these rumors have
any basis of fact, a. well fortiﬁed
group is intent on starting consider-
able disorder and the “military” prep-
arations that have been made make
the situation even more serious than
appears on the s «face,

Agreements’ e ween the stu-
dent legislative bodies of both
Pitt and Tech stipulate a. ﬁne for
either student group that invades
the other’s campus. But students
of either school, assisting stu-
dents of the other in demonstra-
tion against a. common “enemy,”
do not come under council juris-
diction and would ﬁnd themselves
in a. difficult situation should
trouble arise, with no support
from either student or adminis-
tration authorities.

EMONSTRATIONS of any sort,

before or after tomorrow’s game,

will be wildcat celebrations, with no
authority from leaders in either
school, and would violate student and
university rules in addition to city
ordinances, Quiet, orderly, author-
ized demonstrations are excellent,
serve to heighten school spirit, and
provide an outlet for healthy out-
burst of student enthusiasm. Wild-
cat celebrations will not be tolerated
and students engaging in such, be
they from Pitt or Tech, will ﬁnd them-
selves “on their own” and should
seek no assistance in whatever trou-
ble they ﬁnd themselves. The Pitt
Ne-Ws discourages Pitt student par-
ticipation in any demonstrations
whatsoever unless student-authorized,
and suggests to the students at Tech
that a. similar course would be dis-
creet and would avoid any odious
situations that can arise from wildcat
celebrations,

Dean Amos Talks
To WSGA Group

Name Committee, Discuss Work
At Hostess Meeting

The hostess committee of WSGA
met and discussed future plans at a
dinner meeting at Heinz House last
Wednesday. Miss Thyrsa W. Amos,

cance of the word hostess and the
duties of a university hostess. Ruth

presented a short history of the com-
mittee which has been on campus for
seven years.

Sally Isler, C35, chairman of the

lished.

The blue and gold badges that
made their original appearance at the
open house dances following the
home football games were distributed
to the members at the meeting.

To Feature Game

Campus Scout Sees Hard-Fought
Games With Golden Cats
Topping Rivals

By The Campus Scout
The hardest job that the Campus
Scout has to face during the entire
year is at hand, the Pitt-Tech game.
Every season this particular game
rises to cackle hide-

rious and sundry
Campus Scouts to
ask for leaves of ab-
sence or transfer to
the advertising de-
partment where no
one works.

The game this
year is another one
of those things. Pitt, ranked by many
as the greatest team in the East has
a much better record than Tech’s four
Victories, two defeats and two ties.
Therefore, to the senile and decrepit
mind. the Panthers should win with-
out bothering to put on their suits.
This would be just too bad, as the
sight of several reams of nude foot-
ballers would likely cause several of
the male students to pass away in
dead faints. Now for the predictions:

Predictions of the Week:

Hiartwig will show the home town
folks what a good guard looks like.
The battle between Hartwig and
Burzio will be a honey, but my peso-
tas are on Hartwig.

Skladany and Walton will not have
any ground gained through them all
afternoon, and will wind up their col-
legiate careers with deﬁnite proof that
they are among the best linesmen in
any man’s country.

Howdy O’De1l will demonstrate that
147 pounds of football genius is plenty
when you know how to use it. Which
is just why the Scout is for him,

Mike Sebastian, probably the best
broken ﬁeld runner in the country at
the present writing, will make the
newspaper boys sorry they bore down
on him at the beginning of the season.

Timmons, Matesic, Hogan, and On-
der, unsung but valuable Panther grid-
ders, will cause plenty of talk among
those who are ‘fortunate enough to
break grandmals. arm and take the
drumstick.

The game ‘its’e1f'wil1 either be the
toughest of the year for both teams, or
will be a. Panther walk-away. I hard-
ly think it will be a pushover for any-
one. Despite the fact that Tech did
take a beating from NYU on Saturday,
the Panthers will have their hands
full. I pick PITT TO WIN BY 2

bership some of the most outstanding
men on the campus of the University,
I rejoice that the group has been
selected so obviously because of serv-
ice to the University: ‘ind in keeping
with the real ideals of ODK. I sin-
cerely regret, however, that the schol-
astic requirements fo'F‘”"membership
have barred, for the present, some of
the ﬁne men and leaders who cer-
tainly should have been taken into
Gamma circle.”

Men named Monday will be in-
ducted at the ODK banquet in the

giving Formal Tonight At Grotto

 

Dick Gaertner’s
Music Featured
From 10 Until 2

300 Couples Anticipated; Tickets
At $2 Will Remain On Sale
Throughout Day

 

 

The second and ﬁnal dance of the
semester sponsored by the College
association, the Thanksgiving formal,
will open at 10 o’clock tonight at the
Grotto ballroom, North Side.

Dick Gaertner’s popular Pittsburgh
ten-piece band will furnish the music
for four hours of dancing. The affair
«closes at 2 o'clock Thanksgiving morn-
.-ing.

At least 300 couples are anticipated
‘tonight. For the informal dance of
the association in October more than
250 membership tickets were sold, and
these, of course, entitle Plirchasers to
admission to tonight’s event also.
According to committee members, be-
tween 50 and 100 additional tickets
should be sold by tonight.

The tickets will be on sale all day
at $2 per couple in the ofﬂce of the
dean of men, in the office of the
‘College and with members of the as-
sociation cabinet. John Grove, C34,
president, and Edward McBride, so-
cial chairman, warn against the trans-
ferring of membership credentials for
‘tonight, and state that a close check
will be maintained at the door to
guard against this abuse.

lead the ﬁrst of these discussions at
the next Panhellenic meeting, to take
place December 7.

The second in a series of open
houses was held on Monday after-
noon at Heinz House. These open

with the exception of Bucknell, will be met. The schedule:

Interfraternity
Boxing Tourney
Plans Arranged

 

Athletic Department To Award
Trophy To Team Winner;
Entries Due Today

The newest wrinkle in Interfra-
ternity conference athletic projects is
a boxing tournament under the chair-
manship of Andrew VVright, of Phi
Delta Theta. The tournament will
get under way December 12 and will
continue until champ-ions have been
determined in each of eight Weight
classes,

Application blanks have been cir-
culated among the fraternities and
are due in the dean of men’s office
at 5 o’clock today. All fraternities
are eligible to enter “slugger squads”
of not more than eight men and not
more than one man in each weight
class. Although not many fraternities
are expected to be able to provide an
entrant in each class, a fair-sized
turnout is expected,

“No matter how few may be the
entries in this ﬁrst tourney, never-
theless it is a step in the right direc-
tion. In fact, I believe that once the
affair gets started it will ﬁnd wide
favor among fraternity men,” said
VVright in a. statement yesterday.

Cagers’ Lineup
May Be Changed

Mccamant Or Ochsenhirt To Play
Forward Instead Of Guard

 

With practice games against the
East Liberty YMCA quintet, the Wil-
merding Y cagers and the McKeesport
Vvilligs out of the way, the Golden

Panthers are steadily rounding into
form for their opener next Saturday
night. Just which way these prac-
tice affairs went can not be ofﬁcial-
ly determined. Unofﬁcially the re-
sults were not very disheartening for
the local lads,

Perhaps the only development of
consequence in the matter of lineups
during the past Week has been the
shifting of Don McCamant and Russ
Ochsenhirt. Last year these two ‘boys
teamed up to form a pretty nifty pair
of guards. Since Don Smith’s grad-
uation, one forward berth has been
vacated and Coach Carlson is ex-
perimenting with shifting a guard to
forward, inasmuch as he has several
high-class back-court men available.
First it was Ochsenhirt and now Mc-
Camant to be tried at the new posi-
tion. It is highly probable that both
boys will see plenty of service at
both forward and guard before the
campaign is over.

The rest of the ﬁrst team lines up
as before, with Cribbs at center,
“Skip” Hughes at forward and
brother, Charley Hughes at guard.
Pressing close upon the heels of this
combination are forwards “Slim”
W’ainio and Roderick; center, “Pete”
Noon, and guard, “Ken” Kuno.

Saturday the Panthers will travel
to Johnstown, where they will take
pa.rt in a cage clinic at the Univer-
sity Junior college in that town. Those
boys who will make the trip with Dr.
Carlson, head coach, are: Noon, Bond,
Charles Groat, Roderick, Nickel, Wil-
son and Rugh.

District Champs

Wagenhouser Takes Individual
Title In AMA Harrier Meet

 

It was all Pitt over at the Allegheny
Mountain association’s cross-country
run for amateurs in Schenley park
last Saturday. Panther runners took
nine of the ﬁrst ten places in the
ﬁnal standings and the Pitt “A” team
totaled a perfect score of ﬁfteen points
by holding the ﬁrst ﬁve places.

Undivided honors went to Ken
Wagenhouser, who came through with

a remarkable comeback after a some-
what mediocre showing in the IC4A
meet in New York early last week.
“Waggie” led the ﬁeld by yards and
yards to ﬁnish the 5 3-8 miles of the
course in 28 minutes 4 1-5 seconds.
Lawrence, Albright, Kirkpatrick and
M.usico linked arms as they crossed
the ﬁnish line to capture the next
four places for the Pitt “A” aggrega-
tion. Jim Watkins, remaining mem-
ber of the team, was sixth in the
standings,

Tost, Cook and Kopp were the
other local boys to ﬁnish among the
ﬁrst ten. V\7ahl, an Evans City boy,
was the sole non-Pitt man to ﬁnish
in the upp-er ﬂight. Tost, Cook and
Kopp were members of the Pitt “B”
team which aggregated sixty-one
points to place second in the team
standings. The Pitt “C” team was
third in a ﬁeld including representa-
tives from local and district athletic
groups and also unattached runners.

Game With Sandlot Champions
Rumored For Graduates

Panther football fans who regret
the passing from the collegiate scene

of such notables as Skladany, Sebas-
tian, O’De1l«, Onder, Walton and Ho-
gan, among others, may be given an-
other chance to see their favorites in‘
action. A positive movement is on;
foot to match the graduating seniors
of the Pitt football squad against the.
sandlot champions of the district.

The opposition from the leading
sandlot team would be sufﬁcient to.
make for an interesting afternoon.
The sa.ndlot teams take football»
seriously, carrying retinues of coaches
and trainers, and boast of follow-—
ings as high as 10,000.

The Pitt graduates’ team would like-

ly line up with Skladany and Tim-
mons at end; VValton and Meredith at.
tackle; Onder‘ and Tiernan at guard;
and Gelini at center. The backﬁeld.’
would likely consist of Hogan at
quarter; Sebastian and O'Del1 at half,
and Matesic at fullback. Substitu-
tions of Craft at end, Love at tackle-
and Simms at halfback would round
out the roster.
