“Campus Police To Vote
On Union Strike Today

BY DEANNA LOUISE
AND DEBBIE MOXIE

The Campus Police scheduled a

"strike vote for today after a

University representative reported-
ly walked out of a negotiating session
with the Amalgamated Plant Guards
earlier this week when the contract
dispute was only partially resolved,
union steward Arthur Dorman said.
The vote will betaken at 6 a.m. and
2tp.m. today to accommodate both
police shifts.
Dorman said Pitt Labor Relations
Manager Tom Cherry walkedout of a
‘Wednesday meeting when only 15 of

_.,33 contract proposals were settled.

Cherry emphatically denied walk-
ing out of the negotiations and

’ refused to comment further on the

incident, although several sources
reported him as saying, “l-’ve had
enough, I’m leaving.” The sources
said he left the meeting a few
minutes after it began.

The bargaining issue which
precipitated dissent from the union
was a University proposal to
eliminate the six-year-old seniority

qgbidding system for shifts, days off

and work areas.

’ The Campus Police contract with

the University expired June 30.
After the Plant Guard began
negotiating last July, Pitt proposed
eliminating bidding only for work
areas, maintaining the seniority bid
for shifts and days off. .
When Cherrry arrived at the
meeting Wednesday, he said the
University wanted to eliminate all

Carter's Wife Says

bidding within the force and
institute a system which would allow
the police lieutenant to assign work
hours and areas, Dorman said.

Joseph Dutton, vice chancellor for
Business and Finance, said Public
Law 195 gives Pitt the right to
organize public employes and
permits the assigning of beats.

Dorman said an elimination of
bidding would deny the police a
chance to ‘familiarize themselves
with their beats, promote assigning
by favoritism and deny patrolmen"
the right to attend classes because of
uncertainty of working hours.

Union steward John Forgie also
voiced discontent with the negotia-
tions saying the 15 proposals agreed
upon so far “don’t make changes in
anything.” »

,The union also objected to
University proposals to limit the
number of arrests a patrolman can
make during one shift and to initiate
an eight and a half hour working day
with one unpaid half hour off for
lunch. ‘ _\

Only the ambulance beat would be
covered by — lunch-hour replace-
ments.

Patrolmen currently are paid for
lunch hours because they keep their
two-way radios on to receive calls.
The University is proposing that
patrolmen turn off the radios and
forfeit the half hour pay.

“They're trying to force a status
on thelpolice that cannot exist,”
Forgie said, responding to the arrest
quota and lunch hour proposals.

Russian Exchange Proposed

BY SUSAN MANNELIA

Chancellor Wesley Posvar re-
cently proposed «an exchange
program between Pitt and Moscow
and Leningrad state universities, at
the suggestion of the U.S. State
Department.

Though the program has not
been approved or rejected yet,

Over 1200 Pitt students restered vote in the upcoming preidenal

Aleksandr Kukhar, second secre-
tary of the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, plans to visit Pitt later
this month, according to Eugene
Vinogradoff, an assistant history
professor at Pitt.

Posvar sent a letter to Soviet
officials last May 6 proposing that
two faculty members or graduate
students from Pitt and either of the

election at locations in the Towers Main Lobby, Cathedral of Learning and
Student Union Art Gallery on Tuesday and Wednesday.

proposals reached Campus Police
officers, many patrolmen who voted
against Plant Guard representation
in a June election have decided to
join the union, according to Forgie.
He said more than 20 ofﬁcers joined
the union yesterday.

One union representative said,
“They’re testing usto see how much
the new union will take. Most of us
are ready and willing to strike.”

Rosalynn Carter said in a speech at Rodef Sholom last night that
Jimmy’s election as president is her main personal goal.

BY MREA CSORBA

Rosalynn Carter, wife of Demo-
cratic Presidential candidate Jim-
my Carter, stressed her family’s
“helping spirit” in an address
before the Pittsburgh Chapter of the
National Council of Jewish Women
last night.

Speaking under the huge Islamic
dome of the Rodelf Shalom Temple,
Carter said her family is committed
to people, listing mental health
programs as her main, personal
concern.

“When we were campaigning for
Jimmy’s first term as governor, I
met a woman on an early morning
factory tour who said she worked
nights so that her day-turn husband
could watch their mentally retarded
boy,” Cater recalled.

“You cannot help but extend your
heart to people like that,” Carter
said. “Later when I saw Jimmy, I
asked him what he was prepared to
do for mental health. He promised
the best program I have ever seen,
and by the end of his term, Georgia

two Soviet universities participate
in an exchange for about two
semesters.

Under Posvar's proposal, both
institutions would share costs and
make housing arrangements for the
exchange faculty members. The
cost of the program for Pitt would
be about $18,000 per Pitt partici-
pant.

Pitt first expressed interest in
such an exchange with the Soviet
Union last March when the State
Department called on ‘representa-
tives from 50 major American
universities to initiate some type of
exchange, Vinogradoff said.

Most of the schools, notably
Harvard, Columbia and the Univer-
sity of Southern California at
Berkeley, declined to submit plans,
but about six universities did make
proposals, he said.

Only Pitt's plan and another one
from the State University of New
York still are being considered by
the Soviets, according to Vono-
gradoff. A plan was turned down
by the Soviets in July.

' Pitt currently operates similar
exchanges with other Slavic and
East European countries, including
Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Ru-

mania and Poland.

Student Input Nixed At

Senior Budget Hearings

BY TOM WASELESKI

Student participation in the
University’s top-level budget hear-
ings has been ruled out, Student
Government Board (SGB)‘ Presi-
dent Barry Weisband reported at
the Board's meeting Wednesday
night.

Weisband proposed last summer
that one student representative sit
on the Chancellor's budgetary
staff. Vice Chancellor of Planning
and Budget Jack Freeman, who
Weisband said approved the idea,
presented it to the senior staff last
week, where it was turned down for
several reasons. . ~

“First,” Weisband explained,
“the staff claimed although the
information discussed is not
secretive, much of it is delicate.
Second, even though the forum is a
formal body, they said they'd like
to keep it informal, and the
presence of a student would inhibit
some of the staff members. Third,
they also claimed that the student
wouldn't make all the meetings and
that continuity would be lost as
students are more transient than
administrators."

Weisband said the senior staff
recommended student representa-
tives sit on the individual schools’
budget committees instead.

Weisband was unsatisfied with
that proposal, saying, “if the
senior staff isn't going to provide

an example for deans to accept
student participation in the indivi-
dual school hearings, that leaves
some question as to the sincerity of
the senior staff.

“It really would add. a new
dimension to student government
at Pitt,” he said, “because of its
positive activity to link us to the

operations of the University. It ‘

would also encourage stronger

internal ties among the various

student governing groups."

COURT ﬂops
RIZZO RECALL

PHILADELPHIA [AP]—Sipping
from a glass of champagne, Mayor
Frank Rizzo said yesterday he was
“pleased and gratiﬁed” that the

Pennsylvania Supreme Court had

killed a recall petition that would
have forced him to defend his office
in a yes-no election Nov. 2.

“It's over. Finished,” Rizzo told
newsmen. “I never had any doubt
that the Supreme Court would rule
fairly based on facts and the law
and not on emotion. The law was
on my side.”

In an 83-word order, the state’s
highest tribunal upheld a ruling by
the city commissioners that peti-
tions submitted to force a recall
vote were invalid. The high court,
by a 4-2-1 vote, reversed an order
placing the issue on the ballot by

Common-Pleas Court Judge David
Savitt.

In killing the recall action, the
court said it would issue opinions

explaining the order later. Lawyers.

for the 55-year-old Rizzo said the
ruling also declared the recall
question unconstitutional, but the
court did not immediately release
their opinions.

in the country.”

Carter said during her husband’s
term she worked with mentally
retarded children. ‘‘I volunteered
my services at the hospital and
worked every job possible to help
them.”

She told how J immy’s mother was
aregistered nurse, andthough in her
older years she had the love of her
family around her-something
many elderly do not have—she
joined the Peace Corps at 65 and
spent two years in India.

“There are so many concerns,”
she said. “And you are so fortunate
to be in the position to be able to
help,” she told the members of the.
Pittsburgh Chapter of Jewish
Women. “The government cannot
do it all. Groupsthat are dedicated to
a cause can do so much. And a

government concerned and compas-

sionate to the needs of people is such ~0-

a bonus."

Closing her speech, the female
part of the Carter team enlisted her
audience to “listen carefully to
Jimmy Carterthe next five and a half
weeks and see if your vision is not the
same as Jimmy’s is for this
country.”

As a token of mutual understand-
ing, Carter was presented with a
book By Myself, I am a Book!, a
dialogue commentary of the Jewish
immigration experience.

Rosalynn Carter will be joined by
her husband today in Pittsburgh,
when the two will celebrate his
birthday. Carter is scheduled to
appear in a union meeting at the
airport tomorrow and will travel to
Beaver Valley Mall later that day to
mingle with shoppers.

Warlord Class Sparks Crisis

BY RICH HARRY

The current crisis in Lebanon is a
result of internal and external
factors involving a “warload" class
in the country, Lebanese journalist
Golin Maksud said in a speech at Pitt
yesterday.

“We are witnessing (in Lebanon)
a situation that can be described as a
microcosm ofthe entire problems of
Arab countries in their conflict with
Israel, in their yearning for
harnessing development and
growth, and in the political and
social dislocations that ensue in a
nation on the threshold of change,”
Maksud said in an opening
comment. i

Maksud told a small gathering in
Benedum Hall the crisis stems in
part from Moslem and Christian
‘.‘warlords” seeking to maintain an
old feudal system of social classes.

“We cannot [rule out the fact that
internal, intrinsic weaknesses in
Lebanese politics have rendered
Lebanon vulnerable to the break-
down that has taken place,” he said.

Maksud also cited external factors
which led to .the Lebanese crisis,

GOLINMAKSUD
Moore photo

pointing out that Palestinian
refugees ﬂed to Lebanon during the
Arab-Israeli conﬂicts. The Palestin-
ian refugees working in industrial
cities in Lebanon joined with
Lebanese Moslem laborers to form a

v I

working class that has sought the
same objectives of fairer economic
and political representation, he said.

’ This also conflicts with a feudal

system sought by the warlords
controlling the country, he said.
“All these factors and the logical
sequence of historial development,
however, would not have warranted
this extent of violence,” he said.
Maksud called for an increase in
Arab League Security forces in
Lebanon from 4000 to 25,000 to serve
as a “peace enforcement instru-
ment” and help resolve the conflict.
Remarking on Russian and United
States involvement in the Arab
world, Maksud indicated Egypt was
expelled Soviet personnel from the
country and some Syrian positions
are not supported by the Russians.
“All the confrontation states (in the
Arab world) enjoy a good relation-
ship with the U.S. This does not
mean that Russia is not keen on
seeing a failure of U.S. diplomacy.
“If the US. is immobilized by
internal and electoral factors, then
Russia cannot be expected to remain
indifferent to American diplomatic
failures,” Maksud said.

SovietOfficial OK's Detente

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

There is no alternative to the
United States-Soviet policy of
detente, Victor F. Isakov, counselor
of the Soviet Embassy in Wash-
ington, said here yesterday.

“The alternative is awful,”
Isakov said-in Mervis Hall before a
group of students and faculty
members. He said the “relaxation
of .tensions”——the Soviet term for
detente—is essential for our

survival and possibly for all of I

mankind.

Isakov, who was in town to
address the World Affairs Council
of Pittsburgh, said if the two world
powers abandon the policy of
relaxed tensions ,‘_.‘it seems to me
the outcome would be very horrible
for everybody. We are so
interrelated in so many respects
that we cannot just close the door
and remain separate."

Isakov, director of the Soviet
Embassy staff responsible for
studying Soviet-American rela-
tions, criticized the American press
for concentrating on only a few
areas of Soviet life, particularly

dissidents, immigration and Alek-
sandr Solzhenitsyn.

“This is Soviet life for the eyes of
Americans,” he said. “Papers
mostly aren't interested in positive
things. What is the purpose of (a
correspondent) being there (in
Moscow) if he cannot write about
the average citizen, his life,
employment, transportation. ”

In response to a question about

possible effects of internal changes
in China, Isakov said “only time
will tell” what effect there will be
on international affairs.
“We are not against improved
relations between China and other
nations,” he said, provided they do.
not prove detrimental to the
Soviet Union.

Tuition Up, Aid Downi

While Pitt’ s BoardofTrustees went through the motions of approving a
tuition hike last spring, a few members offered some rationalizations to
make the hike seem easier to bear.

They realized the fact that students from lower income families would
have a tougher time paying their tuition. They realized some might have
to drop out.

Not so, said one, because a higher rate of tuition would make these
students eligible for more student aid.

And tuition was raised.

But contrary to the above theory, students discovered that over the
summer the Permsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency

i (PI-IFAA) had become more frugal in determining the amount of student

aid awards.

And now Pitt’swork study programhas undergone cutbacks. There are
more students eligible than there are jobs available. So some students
must do without.

The coincidence isthatthe people who determined Pitt’ s low allocation
fromthe state budget, which causedthe tuition hike, are the same people
who determined PHEAA’s allocation, which causedthe aid cutbacks. The
state legislature is the culprit. , t

Some members of the state legislature will be up for re-election next
month.‘ Before decidingwhetherornotto vote for the incumbent, ﬁnd out
ifhe was among the ones dealing the double blow of tuition increases and
aid decreases by voting for the state budget with the current Pitt
allocation. If he was, ask him why he did it. Then decide.

Ifthe trend continues, as it has in recent years, there will be talk among
University administrators about Pitt’s allocation from the state and the
possibility of another tuition hike. This year, students, do not fall for the
same old rationalizations.

We Know We're Afraid

People are afraid to walkthe streets of Oaldand at night. This is a well
known fact recently quantiﬁed in a study of the quality of life in Oakland

Edmestic Spy Recruiting Here  

.BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
The release of the University's
Five Year Plan, concisely headed
as the University Plan, is perhaps

a the ﬁrst document of its kind.

Needless to say the sheer weight of
the document in terms of the
University is more than enough to
send chills up the spine of ‘many
members ‘of the Pitt community.

There about 110 pages in the
document, each one ﬁlled with
references to goals and plans and
utilization of resources. It is
basically -a necessary work for a
time when corporations of every
size and every aim have to pay
more attention to the results of
decisions. . ﬂ

Reactions to the document were
mixed, however. The writing
within (at least to the denizins of
one campus bar) formed a kind of
literary Rorschach Blot into which
they transferred their fears on
campus.‘

V One regular in particular found.‘

threatening. Particularly because

it did not mention his name. Not
once in any of the 110 pages.

“It has just go‘ to be in here,”
said Professor Jennikins, urgently
searching each printed page.
“How in God’s name could they
avoid it...somewhere."

Jennikins did not find his name
in the Plan, an event which
conﬁrmed his worst fears about his
future with the department.

“I knew it. I knew I should have
joined the department softball
team. This is what happens when
you let important things slide. I've
been read out by the University
Plan!"

Then a darker suspicion crept
into his alcoholic mind.

"What if my name was in here. "
he said, eyes bright with fear and
paranoia. “What if my name was
in here and someone EDITED ME
OUTl"

The idea was just too much.
Jennikins wept at the cruelty of the

Last week there was a movie on
late-night TV called The FBI Story.
The blurb for the movie in the TV
Graphic read: “The exciting story of
the F BI’sﬁght against criminals and
subversives. ‘ ’ But after the endless
revelations of FBI burglaries,
kidnappings, assassination plots,
wire-tapping and dirty-tricks, it
seems that the best way for the
G-men to fight crime and subversion
would be to disband their own
organization.

Thousands of pages of FBI ﬁles,
memos and reports prove that the
secret police agency has infiltrated
andtried to disrupt every movement
andgroupﬁghtingforsocialchange.

The black movement, women’s
‘liberation groups, trade unions and
gay rights coalitions were all
targeted for harassment by the
Bureau.

More than seven million dossiers
have been maintained on individuals
who -dared oppose’ government
policy in any way. Indeed, the
Senate ,,Select Committee on
Intellige "ce concluded its 15-month
investigi:iii5;f1" by admitting that
“virtually every element of our
society has been subjected to
excessive government-ordered in-
telligence inquiries. ’ ’

Anyone who is at all concerned
about democratic rights must be
outraged by these FBI crimes. But it

» would seem that the Pitt administra-

tion is somewhat lessthan outraged.

“If only they had said something

to me," he said between sobs. “I

-would have apologized for what-
ever I did. I would have paid him
back, I would have broken it off
with his wife...anything."

One of the bystanders pried a
five dollar bill out of Jennikins
handand bought another pitcher of
beer, while pointing out that, after
all, he could always get a job
teaching in a high school.

That wasn't the point. Jennikins
replied, slurring his speech. After
dedicating his life and fortunes to
an institution for nearly 10 years, a
person could expect some consid-
eration.

“When Ithink," he said, “of all
the times I cleaned the ditto
machine. Of all the times I turned
off the lights in my office to save
Pitt power...believe me, it shatters
my belief in justice," he blubber-
ed,’ pausing to dip his snout in his
glass of Stroh's. ;

1 say this because the administrati-
on, through Counseling and Place-
ment Services, brought the FBI onto
campus. Last Wednesday, Sept. 29,
the adminstration graciously pro-
vided the government spies with
University facilities so that they

could recruit students into their

sordid organization.

As a socialist and a student
activist, lam vehemently opposed to
providing the FBI with any campus
facilities for recruitment. The
University claims to be a bastion of
academic freedom and a defender of
democratic rights. Yet even a brief
look at the F Bl‘s record reveals that
it is fundamentally opposed to these
principles.

Some of the main targets of FBI
harassment in recent years were the
campus-based antiwar organizati-
ons of the late 60s and early 70s.
I-‘iles recently released from the
agency’s Counter Intelligence Pro-
gram (COINTELPRO) document

disrupted meetings, circulated
literature designed to slander
prominent activists and attempted
to set antiwar organizations against
each other.»

Employers and landlords of
autivists were visited, and bank
records and other conﬁdential ﬁles
were examined. Some antiwar
activists were even subject to
tirebombings, beatings and kidnap-
pings by FBI agents posing as
memers of another group. Faculty
members who opposed the war were
threatened and harassed. The FBI

Jennikins said, a speculative tire
creeping into his eyes. “He never
did get my name right that bastard.

I can’t tell you how many times he
introduced me at conventions as
Jetsam, or Jovial or Jerkoff. See if
I pay for his goddam drinks the
next time the department meets
downtown in that high-priced
restaurant! ' '

“And all the times I taught that
silly introductory course of his...
what tripe! I can’t believe I
actually did that no-good a favor
like that. It hurts, it really hurts,”
Jennikins said, indicating his liver
when he meant his heart, but
accurate all the same.

Someone, a mailman I think,
pointed out that, after all, these
five year plans were only meant to
be general in nature. The
government comes up with them all
the time. the postal employee
pointed out. and you don’t see
anything changing in Washington,
do you? ‘

sent “Poison-pen’ letters to
universities from “concerned par-
ents” demanding that antiwar
professors be fired. One such case
that has recently received national
attention was that of Morris Starsky,
who was fired from his teaching
position at Arizona State University
through the efforts of the local FBI.
The FBI used the same methods
against the black liberation move-
ment. On the campuses the FBI
'attempted to disrupt the black
student unions which appeared in

the late 605. Black student activists ’

had their phones tapped, their
offices bugged and their meetings‘
infiltrated. And there is a growing
body of evidence pointing to FBI
complicity in the assassinations of
‘such prominent black leaders as
Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X

i and Fred Hampton.

Yet the administration . sees
nothing wrong with inviting the
political spies onto campus. But
then, the Pitt adminstration is not
known for its concern for democratic
rights or academic freedom. In fact,
Pitt has quite a record of its own in
the suppressiorriii of academic
freedom. the most recent and most
prominent case is that of . the
sociology professor, Dr. Paul
Nyden. No doubt, the FBI is
impressed by the adminstration’s
work. -
At the same time, the administra-
tion must be grateful for the concern
the FBI has shown in the Nyden case.

Certainly it appreciated the FBI’s

Jennikins said, refusing to be

comforted. “Atilla the Hun had

switchblade. A SWITCHBLADE! ”

turned to Jennikins and mentioned
that the document didn't have the
department chairman mentioned in
it either,

“I-Iah," Jennikins said with
delight. “Serves the crap right.

time we pass a gutter."

Then the distinguished professor

The Charge

One ofthe most important aspects
of the University, besides ’ its
academic function. is the ability to

serve as a forum for all political views ’

and philosophies, from far right to
far left. Academic freedom to
express one's view should not be
denied anyone. The Paul Nyden
case is the latest example of the
struggle for the maintenance of this
right.

And yet it would seem that there
are other examples of the denial of
this freedom here at Pitt. On
Monday, Sept. 27, the Young
Socialist Alliance held a business
meeting at Schenley Hall. At the
conclusion of their meeting two of
the members entered the Student
Union Lobby. While one was
returning the room key to me, the
information desk clerk, Inoticed that

‘ the other threw into the trash bin in

front of the desk all of the literature
and membership forms ofthe Young
Americans for Freedom (a right-
wing group). All of this literature
had been on display on top of the
glass case in the lobby provided for
such use. Anyone interested,
including the YSA, can use this
facility.

I asked this person why he had
thrown them out, and his reply was,
"Well, all of OUR literature gets
thrown out." Without offering so
much as an apology, he left.

This act was not only discourte-
ous, it was an out-an-out act of
censorship. YSA and this person in
particular, have always exercised
their freedom of speech, making use

of the Pitt News, student rallys,
leaflets and the like. This is as it
should be. but when did this
member gain the right to censor
what Pitt students can read and
hear?

The YSA calls the Paul Nyden
affair an example of the denial of
academic freedom by the Universi-
ty. It does not do the YSA justice for
its leading members to deny this

~ same right of expression to its right-

wing counterparts.
May I ask this, YSA member, is
this not one-sided democracy? ‘

D. Morgan
Student Union Information Clerk

oppose the attempts by the
government or anyone else to
prevent those views from being
heard. '

However, last Monday night a
member of the Young Socialist
Alliance, through an irresponsible
act, violated this tradition of the
YSA. Last week a travelling team of
the Young Americans for Freedom
came through Pitt and deposited
literature in the Student Union. One
YSA member took some of this
literature and threw it away.

After a thorough discussion,
every member of the Pitt YSA,

including the offending member,
decided that a public rejection and
repudiation of this regretable
incident should be made. The Young
Socialist Alliance pledges its
continued support for the democra-
tic rights of all individuals and
organizations, and the offending
member offers his apologies to the
Young Americans for Freedom.

Rabbi Joseph H. Levine, new
director and chaplain of the B’nai
B’rith Hillel at Pitt, sees his job as
ﬁlling a variety of functions. As the
administrative director of Hillel
programs,‘as a spiritual leader and a

i counselor, Rabbi Levine leads abusy

life. Most importantly, though,
according to Levine, he gets to help
students. _

I’ve always wanted to go into
college work. This is where the

' action is,” Levine said. He came to

Pitt after 11 years as Hillel director at
the University of Rochester.

“I view myself as a student
worker. My major responsibility is
to be close to the students whether
Jewish or not. I want to humanize
and personalize the campus,”
Levine said. ‘

In order to “bring out Jewish
awareness and expression” in the
students, Levine will extend Jewish
programs to include more religious
and social activities.

Rabbi Proposes Programs For Campus Hillel  

One program which Levine led
successfully in Rochester and which
he hopes to introduce at Pitt is the
“Personalized Jewish Catalogue.”
The purpose of this program,
according to Levine, is to get a
student or a group of students to talk
about their personal Jewish goals.

“They (students) talk about
things they did not know about
Judaism. They design informal
study groups around the objectives
and goals that the students
articulate,” Levine said, “It helps
students to formulate and design
their own courses for a continued
Jewish education.”

In Rochester, Levine also worked
on a program called ‘ ‘Art of Living.’ ’

It is an interfaith project that centers ,
on topics such as intermarriage and ,

interdating. Each topic, according
to Levine, is broken down into four
informal discussion groups which
deal with speciﬁc problems.
“One program might discuss
emotional adjustments in interfaith
marriages. Another would talk on

how to manage married life and how
to handle children,” Levine said.
“We would involve people who were
already married and retaining their
own religions." Levine hopes to
start a similar program at Pitt.

The Rabbi also will experiment
with new forms of J ewish experience
at Pitt.

“We now offer a contemporary
service on Friday nights where
students can develop a creative
worship experience. They can bring
art, music and poetry into the
services,” he said.

Levine’s major interest is “one-
to-one counseling,” dealing with
personal and career objectives,
getting along with parents and
interfaith marriage.

Before working in Rochester,
Rabbi Levine was Hillel director at
the University of North Carolina for
three years and served as assistant
Rabbi in a synagogue on Long
Island for two years after graduat-
ing from college.

Missionary Likes Country

BY BETSY NORMAN

Only one outhouse for 80 kids, no
hot water and the bathtub was a pond
behind the barn, Tom Laffey, a
junior administrative justice major
at Pitt said when describing the
facilities he used while working as a
missionary in Coeburn, Va. this
summer.

“I just got this newsletter when I
was still goingto Indiana University,
and I saw this notice of the Glenmary
Missioners,” Laffey said.

The reasons for Laffey’s interest
are simple.

“I sat around too many summers.
lwas always interested in people and
the mountains. They were removed
from the big city life. We had to pay
$35 to offset the cost of food. I
worked fo_,i' one summer with
mentally retarded kids and I worked
a winter camping retreat with
mentally retarded kids.”

Laffey spent one month at the
Flatwood Job Corps Center located
in the Jefferson National Forest
which is in the southwestern corner
of Virginia. He was one of nearly 400
Catholic high school and college men
who served in the Glenmary Home
Missions of Appalachia and the
South. These missions cover 12
states.

Work assignments varied from
mission to mission. ‘ ‘I had signed to
build houses,” Laffey said, “but I
ended up tutoring in math and
phonics, as well as being a recreation
leader to the kids.”

KENNEDY ASSASINATION
SUSPECTS FREED

SPRINGFIELD MASS. [AP]-A
District Court judge dismissed
charges against three persons
accused of plotting to kill Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy and ordered
the trio free yesterday because he
said there was no probable cause
for prosecution.

Judge George Bregianes ﬁrst
granted a continuance in the case
and later threw out the charges
against Robert E. White, 42; David
J. King, 31, and Sandra R.
Rondeau, 37.

The three were arrested Sept. 11
and charged _ with conspiracy to
assassinate the Massachusetts
Democrat during a campaign
appearance the same day.

They were charged after King
told police and reporters that White
offered him $30,000 to help kill
Kennedy at a hotel where Mrs.
Rondeau worked as a waitress.
Kennedy later attended a fund-
raising breakfast at the hotel
without incident.

King said he called police after
White showed him shotguns to be
used in the assassination, and he
realized that the plan was serious.

POLICE CHIEF COMMITS
SUICIDE

DETROIT lAP]—Deputy Police
Chief Reginald Harvel killed
himself just hours after a major
department shakeup which includ-
ed the firing of Detroit's police
chief, a medical examiner said
Thursday.

Harvel fired two .38-caliber slugs
into his own body Wednesday,
Wayne County's medical examin-
er, Dr. Werner Spitz, said after an
autopsy.

“There is absolutely no doubt it
was suicide," Spitz said. The
shooting took place in Harvel's
home on Detroit's west side.

Police released few details of
their investigation into the deputy
chief's death. But sources
indicated Harvel was concerned
because of published reports last
weekend which uncovered an old
link between Harvel and Willie
Clyde Volsan.

“The kids, mostly black youths,
ranged in age from 16 to 21.

“Most of them were from the
cities, especially Roanoke and
Portsmouth. They looked like they
came from troubled backgrounds,
they had a lot of trouble with their
parents. Quite a few came from poor
backgrounds," he said.

“A lot of the people get the
impression the center is a juvenile
home, which it is not,” Laffey said.
“A lot of the kids are there of their
own accord. Some were there
becausetheirparentsputthemthere
and some were put there by the
courts.”

“I heard stories that these kids
were tough. I was anticipating
something negative happening to
me. They just needed companion-
ship down where I was, ’ ’ Laffey said.

The boys placed at the center
worked for the U.S. Forest Service,
which was a cosponsor of the
missionaries. They built dams and
offices for the forest rangers, as well
as performingothertasks, under the

supervision of the missionaries.

"The kids also are forst ﬁghters
during the fire season which lasts
about four months. They get paid
about $3.50 an hour. The money is
put in a bank for them, ” Laffey said.

But the kids at the center didn’t
work all the time, according to
Laffey.

“The kids enjoyed anything
organized. They might not let you
know it, but they did enjoy it. Every
weekend there was something
different for them. They could go
home if they had a pass and almost
everyone had a pass. We took
weekend camping trips out in the
forest sometimes. We had weekend
trips to Kingsport, Tenn. where the
kids could see movies,” Laffey said.
“They'd do anything out of the
ordinary. Even going to church.”

Although some of the kids at the
center came from shaky back-
grounds, Laffey felt they presented
no great disciplinary problem to the
missionaries.

   
   

Tom Laffey was a Glenmary missionary last summer in Coeburn, Va.

According to Laffey, he wouldn’t mind going back to Coburn next

summer. ‘ ‘I love getting out of Pittsburgh, ’ ’ he said.

“Each missionary could fine them
for doing something wrong, but I
never did that. I never had any
problem. They were as vulgar as
hell, but you just threatened them
and they’d 1isten.”

Encouraged by his experiences,
Laffey is considering working with
the Glenmary missions next sum-
mer.

“I always liked the slower life, the
atmosphere of the country. I love
getting out of Pittsburgh. The
important part for me was working
with other people. I’m not real hard
to please,” he said. “I like the
freedom involved with it. I didn’t
need money, I’ve always enjoyed
that feeling.

“In a way, I'd like to go back to
Coeburn.”

99‘ Floating Theare
Changes Its Stripes

BYTOBIROSEN

Remember the good old days when the price of a show was 99 cents?
Actually, it .wasn’t that long ago.

The 99 cent Floating Theatre specialized in-off-the-cuff entertainment
for a pittance. Past performers sponsored bythe Floating Theatre include
the Iowa Theatre Lab, Shaliko, Bill and Livia Drapkin, women clowns,
ragtime pianists, arial dance groups and a collage of other troupes,
tramps and travesties.

But those days are at a standstill. During this fall term, the 99 cent
Floating Theatre will feature only two events—a New York based dance
group, “Entourage” and a multi-media show of conceptual art by “Ace
the Space.Man.” A '

The 99 cent Floating Theatre has ‘ ‘shifted (its) direction of emphasis’ ’
according to coordinator Richard Mennen. Spring plans include the
development of an experimental performance company under the guise
of Zbigniew Cykqtis from the Polish Grotowski school of theater. The
company plans to produce an original play.

By abandoning its old format and stalking off in a new direction the 99
cent Floating Theatre relinquishes its responsibility of introducing
exciting and interesting performing artists to an otherwise culturally‘
undernourished Pittsburgh audience.

It’s difﬁcult to ﬁnd a culprit lying in the rubble. Mennen recently
ﬁnished his directorial duties in top form with When You Commin’ Back

Red Ryder? He’ll continue directing with the November Mainstage
production Merchant of Venice. The man just doesn’t have any
time—which is a valid reason for curtailing his Floating Theatre

. responsibilities. ..

But in order for a theatrical institution to survive (or even to become an

 

institution) it needs a wide base of support-both creative and financial.
The 99 cent Floating Theatre needs a “survival mechanism.”

Now, I’m not proposing to construct a bureaucartic jungle stocking
fofices with administrative aids and son-in-law vice-presidents.

An organization such as the 99 cent Floating Theatre is pliable enough
to absorb the unique creative energies of its leaders. But the individuals
must ﬁt into the structure—and the structure must be there.

Chancellors. Foundations. Grant givers. Tax loophole specialists.
They have the powerto keepthe momentum of the past two years going to
keep the 99 cent Floating Theatre aﬂoat. ‘

It’ s impossible foratheatre to give change back from a dollar and come

out ahead.

Spring marks the arrival of a “new” Floating Theatre with a “new”
emphasis. But it’ll be a long, lonely winter.

‘Road’ LP Brawling Spirit

One More From the Road
Lynyrd Skynyrd
MCA Records, MCA2-6001

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Three of the more dangerous
situations in this life are jaywalking
on the Parkway an hour before a
Steeler home game, jumping off the
top of the Cathedral of Learning
using an umbrella as a parachute
and attending a Lynyrd Skynyrd
concert.

I know. While attending their
Pittsburgh concert last spring, I was
nearly done in by the ﬂying ﬁst of a
young tough, who insisted that my
derriere was occupying his seat.

l-le, along with the rest of the
motley crowd, was a violent
reﬂection of what Lynyrd Skynyrd’s
music is all about. Kickin’ ass,
drinkin’ whiskey, beatin.’ .upthe old

  

lady, and livin’ to tell about it,
triumphantly, the morning after.

The band’ s new double record live
album, One More From the~Road’,
effectively capture’s this rowdy
spirit. Recorded over a three-day
stand at Atlanta's Fox Theatre, the
album showcases the band’s
guitar-oriented, heavy metal boogie
n’ blues music and surly attitude.

The only problem, as with most
double record sets, several songs
seem to be basically ﬁller. “I Ain't
the One,” “Tuesday’s Gone,”
“Travellin’ Man” “T for Texas,”
“The Needle and the Spoon,” and
Robert Johnson’s “Crossroads,”
plod along and aren't really that
much.

Nitpicking aside, the rest of the
album is very good. Ronnie Van Zant
has an almost sandpaper voice, but
serves as a focus point for the heavy
metal assault of the band’s three
lead guitarists, Allen Collins, Gary
Rossington and.Steve Gaines.

On “Gimme Three Steps,” and
J.J. Cale’s “Call Me the Breeze,”
their playing is punchy and quite
lyrical, while Van Zant chips in some
effective groans. “Workin’ for
MCA,” “Searching,” “Whiskey
Rock-A-Roller” and “Saturday
Night Special’ ’ are similar in format,
but a little more omery in content.

Faculty UP Gallery Opening

BY MREA CSORBA

Opening the fall season of UP
Gallery, ﬁttingly enough, are the
works of Studio Arts faculty
members. And what an initiation.

The works—many that have been 
exhibited before—are obviously the 
culmination of much original and .

intense experimentation.

Still, the close, daily contact
between these faculty members is
evident in their work. For, though
each artist’s works are executed in
an individual strain, an (uncon-
scious) pooling of ideas is reflected
when they are brought together in
one exhibiting room.

Common in many works is the
reverberating action of the paint-
ings’ surfaces. Girt Purins’ vivid
colors ﬂash across his canvases like a
whirling ﬁlmstrip; Paul Glabicki’s
crayon, chalk and acrylic paper
collage surface hops and skips with
radiating arches and jutting angles;
and Virgil Cantini’s gay enamels
over steel pulsate, at times, with
shooting, organic rhythm, at times
with nervous electrical intensity.

Perforated movement used to be a
trade-mark of Christina Floyd’s
works. Now her action is much
calmer. She has forsaken the
hop-scotching of her silver, gray and
black planes across large canvas-
es—an action often maintained over
two or three side-by-side exhibited
works——for still planes that are
pierced by narrow lines. It is our
eyes here that move, following the
guide of those intersecting lines.

Skynyrd concert, after all dope has
been smoked and body worn down
by sweat and volume of the music, is
when the band breaks into their two
signature tunes, “Sweet Home
Alabama” and “Freebird.”

Both are widely played FM tunes
dealing with Southern pride.
“Sweet Home Alabama” is an “up
yours’ ’ reply to anyone who dares to
get down on the Southern lifestyle,
.“Freebird” tells why it's so great.

“Sweet Home Alabama” starts,

out in ballad form, then slowly builds
into a bonaﬁde anthem. Van Zant’s
talking vocals, Billy Powe1l’s honly
tonk piano tinkling, and the grinding
guitars, are all delivered with a
heartfelt conviction.

On One More From the Road,
“Freebird” is stretched into a
bristling 12-minute guitar jam.
Collins, Rossington and Gaines
feverishly trade maniacal guitar
riffs, and the sound is as hot as three
guitars can get.

There, has been talk of Lynyrd
Skynyrd dethroning the Allman
Brothers for the title of “the South's
number one band.” They deﬁnitely
have a shot, but One More From the
Road is not nearly as moving as
Fillmore East album. However, with
the Allman’s inactivity, they are
deﬁnitely the cream of the current
Southern crop.

 

Louis Marinaro’s two piece sculpture is no longer in the UP Gallery
exhibit. The plaster figur-e’s three fingers were broken off during the
weekend, and Marinaro withdrew it from the show. Photographed before
it was taken out, we seethe figure’s hand reflected in shadow on the metal
panel three feetbehind it. Wilson photo

Frank Dastolfo seems to have
been caught up in all energetic
canvases of his colleagues. But
where the other works give us
well-developed, well-personalized
styles in effecting movement with
pain_t, his jungle growth of green and
tan slashes add up to nothing more
than vertical strips of chaos. It is
obvious he is not working in an
inspired genre.

Now theme. The predominant
theme running throughout these
works is the infringements of
modern society on natural territory.
Once again, as with style, the viewer
gets a variety of artist responses.

Wada Wanner’s comment on
modern age is buried in indecipher-
able. hieroglyphics made with the
modern mediam of polyurethane,
metallic powders and acryllic paints.
Whereas cave people may have
smeared esoteric symbols on their
cave living room walls with the paint
of their times—root and berry
juices——Warner smears his alumin-
um panels with the products of our
generation. The ﬁnished look is
distinctly20th Century oily, metallic
art.

Edward Powell’ s drawings give us
a quiet comment on the ambitious
drafting plans of modern society.
His “0ut-post” shows natural
forces tensing against the artiﬁcial
structure inposed on them. Here, a
patio of seething lava is poured in
perfect architectural rectangle over
thelavaofthe background. Achairis
penciled in, depicting the complete
plans of man without athought given
to the natural ‘rights’ (and drives) of
the elements.

Similarly his “Oceanic View”
gives us a foaming ocean frozen into
upright block form, with sandy
sediment draining from it like a
stream of blood.

The most poignant criticism of
modern society’s re-shaping of
nature comes in Glabicki’s collage,
“Sixteen.” The subject is the
displacement of animals and
humans from their natural order
with both slices in half and pasted on
with a gap in the middle.

Cantini, on the other hand, takes a
calm, almost removed attitude to the
whole rat race. His “Accelerated
Landscape” and ~‘»‘reflections’-’ are

gay colorations of our society’s
reverberating pollution of noise,
speed and energy. “Accelerated
Landscape” seems to depict a
thundering highway speeding
through the hub of a city spreading
shock waves for miles around.
“Reﬂections” seems to be the
brightly painted, corn-cob textured
vibesof a million-watted city.

He seems to accept the modern
ageforwhatitis,andusesitto create
splendid art from it for our
enjoyment.

Completing the show in a genre all
by themselves are two pieces of
sculptures by Michael Morrill.

In a world all by themselves, they
are pleasant minimal constructions
among :1“ this vivid canvas works.

‘Night Music’
Scores Big
Al‘ Camelot

BY LEN ROMBERG

Musical composers and play-
wrights have proved just how much
can be done with the musical comedy
genre in the past decade. Camelot
Productions has staged A Little
Night Music, a relatively new
musical created by Hugh Wheeler
and composer Stephen Sondheim
emphasizes originality with style
and content.

Loosely based on Ingmar Berg-
man’s ﬁlm Smiles of A Summer
Night, A Little Night Music takes the
audience back to Sweden at the turn
of the century. The story, which is
quite involved with intricate
relationships, relives lost romances
and creates new ones.

The story begins with a lawyer
who has been remarried to an
18-yearold woman, no older than his
son. They have been married for 11
months, but she is still a virgin. This
propels him to visit an old friend
whom he once loved (who happens to
be an actress) and is discovered
there by her new married lover. The
lover’s wife attempts attempts to

resolvethe situation and informs the
young wife of her husband's
inﬁdelity.

Continuing into the second act,
the actress’ mother invites the
lawyer, his wife and son for a
weekend at their summer country
estate. Complicating matters
further, the lover and his wife barge
in, adding a ﬁnal touch of confusion.

The plot is hard to follow,
especially the opening number.
However, Hugh Wheeler’s book
providesmanyhumoroussituations,
and from the opening “Night
Waltz” through the ﬁnale, Stephen
Sondheim’s score is a delight to
listen to.

His soft, melodic, relaxing score is
ﬁlled with several beautiful waltz
numbers and intelligent musical
dialogue. The music is present
through most of the book, releasing
the story slowly, but keeping its
audience interested.

Camelot’s version offers a
talented cast that performs and
vocalizes very well, allowing the
audience to enjoy Sondheim’s score.
Particularly good performances
were given by Tom Caruso, the
lawyers son, and Lee Moorhouse, as
Count Malcolm.

Caruso plays the role of Henrik,
who is completing religious studies
to enter the clergy. He ﬁnds every
act in the world a sin. Moorhouse as
Count Malcolm displays a mixture of
military pride, arrogance and
stupidity.

The show suffered from a lack of
direction during certain numbers
and sequences. Scenes were not
always coherent, resulting from
slow movement of stage furniture
and lack of action. . Once the
audience was able to put the story
together, toward the end of Act two,
slow scene changes and empty spots

“Practice like you play" is the
new motto of the Pitt Panther
football squad and head coach
Johnny Majors who are taking their
3-0 record and number two ranking
south to face the always tough
Duke Blue Devils.

“I think our practice sessions
have been alert, enthusiastic and
aggressive this week,” Majors
said. “Hopefully we’ll play like we
practiced. If you practice well
during the week, you’re going to
play well on Saturday so that
Saturday can be a fun day.

“That's the way I hope our
football team has practiced this
week--with good intentness, so it
can go down and play well against
Duke and hopefully win.”

Not only will the Panthers be out
to win tomorrow, they will try to
restore some of the confidence they
may have lost last weekend against
Temple. Also, to keep their lofty
Associated Press ranking, they
may even be thinking about rolling
up the score, which, unfortunately,
seems to be the main criterion to
reach the national championship.

But it won't be easy. The Blue
according to their

‘preseason media guide, they have

one of the most talented offensive
backﬁelds in the country and they

French added two more goals in

“Pitt is a ﬁrst-year team so they

“We were just up against a team

coach Janet McDowell said.
“Indiana is one of the toughest
teams on our schedule.”

Last year, Indiana went 6-2 for
the season. Nesbitt has coached
the squad for three years. The
team is not lacking experienced
players.

“Our girls were stunned,"
McDowell said, adding that many
Pitt players had never before even
seen a well-played ﬁeld hockey
game.

McDowell cited special praise for
goalie Robin Brust, one of the few
experienced players on the Pitt
team. .

legitimate candidate for the Out-
land Trophy, Bryan is Duke's top
lineman since Coach McGee
captured the Outland in 1959.

Defensively, Duke could cause
some trouble. The defensive front
wall is comparable in size to Notre
Dame's and possesses a lot of
speed, while the linebackers are
also big and quick. Last season,
the Blue Devils allowed fewer
points (212) than any conference
member, with the exception of
champion Maryland.

So this week it should be a real
battle. The Panthers have scored
94 points in their first three games
for a 31.3 point average, while
Duke has allowed only 45 (15 points
per game). Pitt defenders have
allowed just over 10 tallies per
game though.

“At this stage, our defense has
played better as a team than any
defense we’ve ever had,” Majors
said. “They have been a very
pleasant surprise. They may not
have been as highly touted in
preseason, and I think they took it
as a challenge.”

Defensively, the Panthers rank
12th in the country in total defense
(216.3 yards per game) and 18th in
rushing defense (115.3). Arnie
Weatherington leads the squad
with 35 tackles, while his lineback-
ing partner Jim Cramer is right
behind with 34. .

  Boaters Bewitched, 1 -1

BY JIM LEWIS

The. Pitt soccer team was up
against more than just a soccer
squad Wednesday night at Pitt
Stadium--they were faced with a
jinx.

Carnegie-Mellon University must
have had the services of a fairy
godmother, for to face the barrage
the Tartans did and still come away
with a thankful 1-1 double-overtime
tie after countless opportunities to
lose, one would have to have the
supernatural on one’s side.

Even though the score was a tie,
don’t be fooled——Pitt Was in
command after the first half.

‘ ‘In the secondhalf, we tired them
out,” Pitt coach Leo Bemis claimed,
“so they weren’t as skillful as they
were in the first half.” '

That’s an understatement. The
Tartans, playing in only their second
game of the year, were obviously
worn out toward the end, but with
good timing and a littleblack magic,
were able to hold the Panthers to just
one goal in a 40-minute Pitt
onslaught.

After the sloppy first half ended \

with CMU in front 1-0 on a bad
clearing pass from. the Pitt
goalcrease directly to a Tartan
lineman , the Panthers took complete
control, ﬁnally outshooting CMU
23-3.

“We took control of the game by
being aggressive,” Bemis said.

They certainly did; never has the
Pitt offense had so many good,
legitimate scoring opportunities this
season.

And never has the Pitt offense
fallen on such dismal luck.

Sure goals mystically bounced off
crossbars and slid inches wide of
open nets. -

Finally, in the middle of the
second half, freshman Rick Roccon
broke the jinx.

Pitt halfback Marty Moyer’s pass
in front of the CMU net bounced by a
couple Tartan‘ defenders right to
Roccon, who kicked it under a

lunging CMU goalie for Pitt's only
tally in many chances.

It was Roccon’s second goal of the
year, making him team leader along
with Craig Connolly. Moyer notched
his ﬁrst point of the season.

With a goal under their belts, and
a hard-working Tartan team
growing tired, the Panthers contin-
ued their devastation; but CMU’s
witch was working double-time-
the ballneverwantedto go inthe net.
And so it ended, ahalfhourlater, in a
’1-1 deadlock.

Bemis, however, was satisfied
with his team’s performance and felt
that his Panthers (2-2-1) are on the
rise.

“They showed they can come
alive,” he said. “We knew CMU
had a good team. Our guys now
know they can do the job
offensively.’ ’

Yes, the ' offense can—Roccon,
Moyer,  Gyory and Todd
Wawrousek -all had a great game.

Pantherette Spikers Open

1976 Season Tomorrow

BYJOHNFINN

The 1976 edition of the Panther-

ette volleyball team is anxiously

\ awaiting its season opener tomorrow
at Ashland College of Ohio.

Why are the women so anxious
about starting another season?
Perhaps because they have some-
thing to prove. Last year’s 18-2
record including the appearance in
the quarterﬁnals of the EAIWA
Regionals will be a tough act to
follow.

But head coach Mike Herbert
expects his hard-working Panther-
ettes to be equal to thetask. ' ‘I really
don’t know‘ what to expect, not
having seen the competition,” he
said, ‘ ‘but I’m quite pleased with our
progress thus far.”

And he should be pleased.
Despite the loss of three regulars
from last year's squad, Herbert
posted a ﬁne recruiting year. Mary
Savage and Mary Lou Susang, two
fine freshman setters from state
champion Norwin high school, along
with Andrea Platz from Ohio and
Cindy Chambers from York, round
out the list of blue-chip recruits.

Platz was invited to an Olympic

Volleyball Development Program
try-out, while Chambers was named
most valuable player at the 1974
AAU Junior Olympic National
Volleyball Tournament.

In addition to these fine recruits,
veterans Jamie Andrews, 1974
MVP, and Pat Montgomery, 1975

MVP, are returning this season.‘

Juniors Debbie Stinner and,Diane
Zaken and seniors Kathy Hudgens
and Kathy and Gail Evans ﬁnish out
the squad.

Should the Pantherettes continue
their winn. U "ays, they will be
invited to the Eastern Regionals at
Edinboro State College. A good
showing there couldtake them to the
National Champsionships at the
University of Texas at Austin.

Just how far can this year's team '

go? Well, Hebert, a pragmatic,
realistic coach, will tell you they are
workin hard andtalkingone match at
a time. .

But who knows? Maybe some
hard work and a little bit of luck will
help to send Hebert and his spikers
to the sunny South at the end of the
season.

1 Water Polo Surfaces

. BY STEVE SYBERT

While the football team was
rebounding from its one-victory-a-
year seasons to reach the national
limelight and the number two
ranking by the Associated Press,
everyone walked around proudly
boasting of the team’s resurgence
and a guy appropriately called
“T.D.” i

But when, out of a dark corner
somewhere in Trees Hall, there
comes a group of guys» who have
grown from club status to
“unofﬁcial" varsity, the nation’s
ninth-ranked team and number one
in the East, hardly anyone knows of
it.

The team, which is joining what
is beginning to be a long list of
talent-laden squads at the Univer-

vsity, is the water polo contingent,
C coached by Miguel Rivera, who has
set some pretty high goals for his
young team.

“We’re counting on going
"undefeated this year, though a
couple of games could gojeither
way” said Rivera,—who coached the
Puerto Rican national team for 10
years and an All-America at San Jose
State, when they captured the
national championship in 1968,
before he came to what was then a
club at Pitt in 1974.

After compiling a 5-1 record in its
initial year, the club continued its hot
pace in 1975 to ﬁnish with an 11-4
mark and as the third-best team in
the East behind top-ranked Buck-

perhaps the most impressive
performan-ce—that of the Pitt
defense.

“The defense was able to keep

. them closed in,” Bemis stated.

The Tartans were always pinned
up in their own end, and only got past
Pitt’ s 20-yard line once in the first 15
minutes of the second half. With
seniors Kim Blasko and Tom
Murphy anchoring the defense,
CMU was unable to muster any
serious attack for the rest of the
match.

Tomorrow afternoon Pitt faces
destined-to-be nationally ranked
Temple in Philadelphia.

Always a powerhouse, the Owls
are even betterthis year with a
veteran squad and a 2-0 record so far
this season against superior compe-
tition.

we play two halves like we played the

~ ‘‘I’m really conﬁdent this sea-
son,” Rivera said, hoping for at least
a sixth-place ﬁnish for the Panthers.
“Even if we don’t play up to our
potential, we still should win. Only
injuries can keep us away.”

With performers who have
competed in at least one national
tournament and two players from
the Puerto Rican national team,
Rivera feels the team is loaded with
players who can master the strength
and speed in swimming and the
techniques of passing, shooting and
strategy needed for a winning water
polo team.

One Puerto Rican, sophomore
Butch Silva, was a member of the
All-East team last season and
runnerup for most valuable player.
His countryman, freshman Jorg
Machicote, has impressed Rivera
in preseason play and should be the
team’s highest scorer this year.
Two other newcomers to be
counted on include Mike Mere, of
Miami, and Barry Ford, of
Philadelphia. V

“Every team bases their
strength on the juniors and seniors,
but we’re basing ours on our
freshman and sophomores,”
Rivera boasted of his youthful
talent. “We’re going to have a ﬁne
team for at least four more years.”

Senior goalie Walter Young, was
third-best in the East last year at
his position and should be tops in
1976 as the two ahead of him have
graduated. Pitt's only loss from last
year’s squad was All-East and

team of Dane Frey and Terry Lies.
DeCostro, a transfer from Edin-
boro, defeated Indiana"s Mimi
Debor, 6-2, 7-6, while Frey and
Lies also won in straight sets.
They fared extremely well
considering this was their first
match together. Paris looked very
sharp as she downed Sally Bissel,
6-0&6-52’. Pitt’s Janice Irwin lost a
very close match in 3 sets. Nancy
Gordon, now starting her second
year as head tennis coach, was

quite pleased with the netters’ '

performance. ,
“Weplayed quite well and ,we
-obviously have a very good team,”
Gordon said. “We also played a
good team and so it was a nice way
to open the season. Maria looked
as good as ever. Janet played well

despite having injured her right 4

hand, and although she lost Jan
Irwin, looked very sharp.

“I was also pleased with the
doubles teams. I may start to shift

teams, but naturally I would to ﬁnd I

a regular combination as soon as
possible," she said.
The netters’ entire season

prospect appears quite bright. Last’

year, Pitt was 6-5 overall but went
undefeated in the fall.
graduation losses were heavy, this
year’s newcomers appear to
compensate for them. They
include transfers Pam Bachman
and Frey, both number one singles
players from Butler and Bethel
Park respectively; freshman Nancy
Ballisteri; and all-Philadelphia Jan
Brownstein. .

Paris is coming off a strong
summer that included the Nation-
als at Salt Lake City, and Ann
Seebolt should soon be coming off
the injured list.’ The schedule will
be much more difﬁcult, however,
with the addition of Michigan State
and Maryland.

Coach Gordon is also very
optimistic. “We should have a
very successful season," she said.
“We’re better than last year’s
team and we have a lot of depth.

, Fun And Games, Do You?

BY MARIA SCIULLO

Cross country, like most sports,
has its ups and downs. There’s
something about running up a
muddy, slick grade or along an
isolated forest path in 50-degree
weather that makes one appreciate
the efforts of Frank Shorter.

Lovers of the sport speak
enthusiastically about the scenery,
but very often a runner’s too busy
moving along to notice the ﬂora and
fauna. To tell the truth, this
docile-looking pasttime of running
can be downright dangerous.

Let’ s go through a typical running
session at Schenley Park. First,
we’re going to jog a half mile, just to

warm up. Soon after that comes a .

series of ﬂexibility exercises
guaranteed to make you feel like a
Gumby doll in the hands of a
six-year-old.

If you haven’t pulled any muscles
during the warmup, we’re all set.
Now the real hazards begin.

You will notice an assortment of
dalmatians, German Shepherds and
Doberman pinschers over there on
our right. They look tame enough,
but really, they’ve been waiting a
half hour just for us.

“Everyone lets their "dogs out
loose in the park at exactly 4:30 when
they know we’ll be practicing,”
revealed Pitt runner Becky Falck.
After all, what fun could a dog have
chasing and biting at anyone just out
jogging for the heck of it? No, it’s
much better to nip the heels of a
runner who is trying to get through
the course as quickly as possible.

Now that we've managed to
escape the “Hounds of the
Baskervilles,” let’s move on to the
next obstacle, aroad intersecting the

trail. At first glance, there appears
to be little trafﬁc, so we’ll start
across. , .
Halfwaythere, eight cars sudden-
ly materialize from both directions

'i:)‘o You LIKE

For over 750 yearsthe Conventual Franciscans Friars have labored to preserve
the spirit of St. Francis in the service of God and his people.

In our day the Franciscan Friars continue to play a strong part in building a
world of Christian hope and joy which St. Francis, in the imitation of Christ began

The Franciscans have never limited themselves to
any one type of work in the church. We continue today to
be ready to make ourselfs available to be-of service for the

moving at 60 miles per hour. The
trick to getting through is‘speed,
agility and the hope that the cars will
stop. If they don’t, it is comforting to
remember that several hospitals are
only minutes away.

The next four miles are easy if you
don’t mind a simple slope, fittingly
named ‘ ‘Killer Hill.’ ’ Its 85-degree,
rocky face is especially good for
climbing in the rain.

:9

Our run takes us to a ﬁnal V‘

highlight, the golf course. A Penn
State athlete claims that gym
teachers give an “A” to golf
students who manageto wing a
harrier with a tee-off shot. Perhaps
Pitt has made a similar arrange-
ment.

We cross the road again and by
this time, it’s time for dinner. The
other women on the team have had
time to change clothes and arrive at
the cafeteria wearing scarves,
jewelry and Garland sweaters.
Slowly, we shuffle by dressed in
grubby practice clothes and the
latest in gray, army surplus
sweatsuits.

Actually, it is more interesting in a
meet. Getting lost in Schenley Park
is nothing compared to running the
wrong way in competition. How
reassuring it is to hear that you
‘ ‘ .. . just follow the white chalk line in
the direction of the arrows and you
CAN’T get lost.”

The supreme thrill of a‘ race is at
the start. Here, what seems like
2,000 runners are all ready to
converge upon the ﬁrst course
marker. California State College
begins its invitational ‘with a
countdown reminiscent of Apollo 1 1 .

Despite the afore-mentioned
aspects of cross country, lithe sport
can still be just an uphill grind. If you
don’t believe it, try a run up “Killer
Hill” and see.
