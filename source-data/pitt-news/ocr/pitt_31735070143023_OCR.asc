Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, the

Ravenstahl ﬁrst told report-

He said officials in his oﬂice will
use photos and video footage from

“I wasn’t there myself, so you
probably had a better perspec-

Riotgssed students and protest-
ers were not the only ones affected
by Thursday evening’s G-20 Summit
demonstrations in Oakland.

Businesses along Forbes Avenue
also suffered property damage as a
result of rowdy protests. ‘

“It has affected us tremendously,”
Matthew Walsh, manager of Subway
on Forbes Avenue, said of the restau-
rant’s broken windows. “It’s put quite
adamper on business.” .

Ten Oakland storefronts —includ—

ing McDonald’s, Rite Aid Pharmacy,

Bruegger’s Bagels and American Ap- .

panel — sufferedbrokenwindows and

Walsh, who was not in the restau-
rant atthe time ofthe property damage,
said an employee called him Thursday
nightwith reportsthatthe restaurants

“We’ve lostatleast75 percentof our

can’t afford to replace awindow, too.”

Pamela’s Diner also suffered prop-
erty damage because ofthe protests. Its
storeﬁont windows had shattered.

Co-owner Michele Mazzella said
she arrived at the restaurant Thursday
night afteranemployee calledto report
the damage.

She said the diner’s insurance will
cover most of the window replace-
ments, but some of the  will
be out of pocket.

Mazzella said shestilldidn’tunder—
stand why protesters would vandalize

local businesses.

“I don’t get it —— the violence, the
destruction. I don’tgetanyofthat,”she
said. “My question is, ‘Who didthis, and
what is the cause?” ’

Asprotests-continued onThursday

One punishment
too many  

itt witnessed mayhem
on its streets Thursday
night.

Demonstrators --
most of whom were from out of
town —- and police — most ofwhom
were from out of town —- faced off
for hours, using our campus as a
battleground.

In the end, more than 10 busi-
nesses and other University prop-
erties were vandalized. Forty two

people were arrested.

Friday night was a different at-
mosphere, but no less chaotic.

Trying to avoid a repeat of the
night before, police deployed about
400 officers into Oakland. While
there were no repeats of vandalism
and fewer protesters in Oakland,
110 people were arrested, mostly for
failure to disperse and disorderly
conduct.

Robert Hill, Pitt’s vice chancellor
of Public Affairs, said the University.
will send arrested and cited students
to its judicial Board, which is com-
posed of undergraduate and gradu-
ate students, aswellas other Pitt staff
and faculty members.

Like it did after February’s Su-
per Bowl riot, the board has the au-

thority to suspend or expel students .

who violated Pitt’s Student Code of
Conduct. ‘

But Friday night was very differ-
ent from both the Super Bowl riot
and Thursday night’s demonstra-

. tions.

Many people found themselves
surrounded by police forces Friday,
hearing orders to disperse but having
no idea where they can disperse to.

Someone studying in the Cathe-
dral of Learning could, at one point
Friday night, walk outside and ﬁnd
themselves behind police lines. Other
students on the Towers patio, even if
they were stepping out of their dorm
room for a cigarette, were gassed
and arrested. Others found them-
selves walking home from work or

a friend’s house, blocks away from .

Schenley Plaza, but nonetheless in
an area police deemed an “unlawful
assembly.”

It’s certainly possible that some.

students were instigating violence
— and the lawwill rightfully punish
them for it -4 but many of the stu-
dents arrested for failure to disperse

weren’t arrested because they were

standing up to police forces. Some
just happened to be within an area,
encompassing much of Central Oak-
land, thatpolice didn’twantanybody
to be in. ‘
It’s too earlyto say that police
were either right or wrong in their
strategy — after all, there was. a
string of vandalism here the night
before — but one thing is clear: The
situation was unfair to students.
Pitt sentoutanEmergencyNotiﬁ-

_ caﬁonservicealertadvisingsuidents

to stay near their residences, but it
did not say that students would be ar-
rested ifthey went outside. To be fair,
there’s no way Pitt could have known,
butthat just shows howunsuspecting
the Pitt communitywas of the inten-
sity of Friday’s police action.

Pittstudents, the neighborhood .

of Oakland and the University it-
self were all victims of Thursdays
conﬂict, and Frid_ay’s heightened
police actions were a result of that

conﬂict. While it’s too earlyto know .

exactly how  ofFriday’s arrests

werestudents,manystr1dent:slikely .

encountered police force without

knowing that they were part of the"
“unlawful assembly” that appar-

ently encompassed more than few

blocks, an area where thousands of
students live.

What we do know is that Friday
night was ridden by confusion and
ambiguity. It is unreasonable to
hold students to the standards of
prescience to not ﬁnd themselves
behind erratic and fast-moving po-
lice lines and the ability to decipher
the uncoordinated and contradic-
tory orders of an aggregate police
force.

As a result, The Pitt News calls
for universal amnesty from Pitt’s
Judicial Board for all students ar-
rested in Oakland on Friday night.
It is absolutely impossible for the

‘ Judicial Board to differentiate be— _

tween students arrested forfailure to
disperse because they were defying
authorities and those arrested for
failure to disperse because theywere
walking home.

The Pitt communityhasbeenthe
victim of enough disruption at the
hands of an ideological conﬂict that
is not theirs. It would only be out of
disregard and cold indifference to
subject the community to further
unrest.

aneight-hour-longprotest-t11medl-riot
thatdamaged Oakland businesses and
prompted police to use force.

About 50 people gathered near
the bridge closest to Schenley Plaza
at 4 p.m. Thursday_to see Obama’s
motorcade drive to the Phipps Con-
servatory. _ ' _

' Obama and his wife, Michelle,
hosted aworking dinnerinthe green-

house for the other G-20 leaders and ‘

near the traﬂic light at the bridge.

Demonstrators ripped the tape and
began leapfrogging over one another

. and toward the police.

Police declared the event an “un-
lawful assembly” around 6:30 p.m.
and warned protesters, inboth English
and Spanish, that if they didn’t leave,
they could be arrested or “subject to
other police action.”

When the people didn’t move, po-
lice launched a smoke bomb into the

It was the ﬁrst of many times po-

lice would ﬁre gas orsmoke into the
crowds, which eventually grew to in-

‘ clude hundreds of, if not more than

1,000, people.

The crowd simmered down for a
few hours after the  smoke bomb,
atone point dancingto musicprovided

Oakland sees fLTSt
quiet night since
Wednesday

Staﬁ’ Report

In a change of pace, about 40 peo-
ple peacefully protested Saturday
night.

_ A group of college-aged people
met in Schenley Plaza around 10
p.r_n. to protest police behavior
during demonstrations the pre-
vious two nights.

The protesters stood in the park
talking or playing hackey sack until
about 10:50 p.m., when they be-
gan walking down Forbes Avenue
chanting, “No justice. No peace.
F*ck the police.”

From Forbes Avenue they trav-
eled up Meyran Avenue, down Fifth
Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard and
then back onto Forbes, stopping in
front of the Pitt Police substation
by David Lawrence Hall.

One of the ‘demonstrators,
Graduate School of Public and In—.
ternational Affairs student Anne
Marie Toccket, said the crowd
protested not only the police of-
ﬁcers’ use of force on Thursday
and Friday, but also how the police

intimidated peaceful demonstra- -

tors. g

“We’ve all heard the anecdotes
that the police were misbehaving,”
she said. *

Toccket said she recognized a
lot of the demonstrators Saturday
from her classes and that she was
pleased with the turnout.

“I think it takes a lot more cour-
age to come down when the num-
bers are small,” she said.

There were about eight dem-
onstrators who put masks on their
faces for part of the march.

The demonstrators confronted
the suspected undercover police
officers in front of Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall and Mu-
seum.

A few dozen Pitt and city police
ofﬁcers watched the march, most
without riot gear. When the dem-
onstrators stopped at the substa-
tion, about eight officers in riot
gear came out of police vehicles.

The demonstrators left for
Schenley Plaza, and the demon-
stration ﬁzzled out by midnight.

Pitt Police used the Emergency
Notiﬁcation Service to warn stu-
dents twice on Friday and once
on Saturday, but did not use it
Thursday — the only day that
there were ofﬁcial G-20-related
events scheduled in Oakland and
the day that saw the most van-
dalism.

People began assembling by
Schenley Plaza around 4 p.m.
Thursday to see President Ba-
rack Obama’s motorcade. Around
6:30 p.m., police deployed riot-

control gas for theﬁrst time that

week.

There wereabout 1,000 G-201

Summit demonstrators and on-
lookers on Thursday and between
100 and 200 in Schenley Plaza
on Friday. ’ - .

Some attendees, like Pitt stu-
dent Michael Ramella, said they
wished they would have received
a notiﬁcation from the University

before venturing out on Thurs-
day.

“If we knew there were ri-

our friend’s house and tried to
walk home  had it been used
like Friday and Saturday nights,
innocent people who never even
wanted to be onlookers to the
riots would not have left their
homes,” Ramella said in an e-
mail. , S

Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney
explained why he enabled the
emergency notiﬁcation system
on Friday. . A

“We couldnot have what hap— .

pened [Thursday7]’night,” he said.

“We wanted__to let the students ,

know we had trouble.”

Pitt freshman Darren Krieg
said that he received two text
messages on Friday. A

The first message, sent at‘

approximately 7:28 p.m., said,
”G-20 disturbances may continue
tonight. Be careful.»Exercise good
judgment. Safety tips available at

, my.pitt.edu.”

gEme'rgency Notiﬁcation Service during G-20 events.

The second notiﬁcation, sent
by 10:05 p.m., said, “Conditions
may be deteriorating in Oakland.
Students are advised to remain
near their residences.”

~ Krieg didn’t take the advice.

“I kind of had my heart set on
going out and seeing what every-
thing was about [Friday night] ,”
he said. “I was interested to see
what everyone was putting to-
gether, whether it was going to
live upto the hype.”

Pitt sophomore Kendra Siegel
said she assumed there would be

. demonstrations on Thursday but

appreciated the notiﬁcation text
on Friday. Though it didn’t keep
her from going to a friend’s house
in South Oakland, she said it kept
her away from Schenley Plaza.
Delaney said he thought the
notiﬁcation system was helpful,
adding that most of the com-
plaints he received were from
people who didn’t know what was
happening Thursday and wanted,
police to start notifying people.

—eration of crowd control by domestic po-
lice,” Pittinger said. ‘ ’
Police also used smoke and OC vapor gas,
not tear gas, to try to disperse the crowd.
OC vapor gas, Delaney said, is essentially

the same as pepper spray or mace. It’s meant
to “takethe aggression out” of someone,
though it can sometimes backﬁre and make
people on drugs become more violent.
“You gotta do it right,” Delaney said.

Pittinger said she was “quite familiar” B

with the arrests in Oakland on Friday
night, and she encouraged students or
readers with information or complaints
to call the review board.

“When they call, we need to know their
name, how we can reach them, whatever
they need to tell us about the incident,”_ she
said. “They don’t need to be intimidated

City police spokeswoman Diane Rich-
ard did not respond to phone calls or e-
mails requesting comment.

‘ Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney said at
least 10 police departments were helping
Pittsburgh police during the G-20. ‘ _

’ “When you have a police department
out of the state, they don’t quite know all

the relations,” Delaney said.

A police ofﬁcer can order a “disor- -

derly” group to leave an ‘area if the of-
ﬁcer reasonably expects that the group’s

presence will result in “substantial harm ‘

or serious inconvenience, annoyance or
alarm,” according to an American Civil
Liberties Uniontipamphlet about protest-
ing at the G—2o. L

Delaneysaid failure to disperse was
the most common reason people were
arrested Thursday and Friday.»

Tracey Hickey, a Pitt freshman, was

arrested on Thursday night for failure . -

to disperse outside the doors to Towers

Lobby. —. ' "
She said was trying to hold the door‘

open for people to get in. A YouTube vid-

~ eo, which shows ofﬁcers chasing people

toward Towers lobby, also shows police
taking Hickey away after people ran into
the dorm lobby. A

“I was never expecting to be arrested,”
Hickey said in an e-mail. ‘5First of all, I
never heard an order to disperse onthe
Fifth Avenue side of the patio.”

She said a few moments before she was f

arrested, police hadn’t interfered with her

, holding the door open -for people on the
. Forbes Avenue side of the patio‘. ’

“As far as I was concerned, I was help-
ing people to disperse,” she said. a
_ Article F, chapter 55, _section two of
the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, which
describes the law pertaining to failureto

‘ disperse, says: -

“Where ' three ‘or more persons _ are

"participating in a course of disorderly

conduct which causes-or may reasonably
be expected to cause substantial harm

or serious inconvenience, annoyance or.

alarm, a peace officer or other public ser-
vant engaged in executing or enforcing the
law may order the participants and others

in the immediate vicinity to disperse. A-
‘ person who refuses or knowingly fails

to obey suchan order commits a misde-
meanor of the second degree.” - V

Officers also chargedsome people with
disorderly conduct, described in the next
section of the code.

Disorderly conduct is defined as when
someone “engages in ﬁghting or threaten-
ing, or in violent or tumultuous behavior,
makes unreasonable noise, uses obscene
language, or makes an obscene gesture, or
creates a hazardous or physically offen-

sive condition by any act which serves no

legitimate purpose of-the actor,” provided
those actions are made “with intent to
cause public inconvenience, annoyance
or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk
thereof.”

“I really think it’s ridiculous,” Egler said. “We
