Pitt Police Delay Fire Call

By NlCK ARNETT

Special to The Pitt News’

(Part 1 of a 2-Part Series)

A six minute delay by the cam— .

pus police in calling the Pittsburgh
Fire Department may have cost Pitt
thousands ofdollars during last Fri-

day’s $50,000 three-alarm fire at the

%

 

tollowlna last week's tire.

   
   

Police assess the damage done to th

reer-Se

university's Faculty Club.

Campus police spokesman Lt.
Jim Watters said his records show
that a call was received by the police
communications center at 6:l2 p.m.
A spokeswoman for the city’s fire
department dispatchers said she
didn‘t receive a call from the campus
police until 6:l8 p.m. .

The reason for the six-minute

 

« I " *3'3‘f‘1r3'?'35iiZ3V t?‘ '

 

delay apparently lies in a campus
police policy which the city fire chief
has declared wrong.

According to Watters. the police
do not always immediately notify
the fire department ‘when a call
comes in about a possible fire. How-
ever. he added. “lf>there‘s any ques-
tion about the severity. we’ll call in
the city fire department.“

With people in suits milling
around blue cloth-covered
tables. and the din of conversa-
tion filling the arcade on the first

H floor of Forbes Quadrangle. the

place looks like the aftermath of
a $l00-a—piece Republican fund-
raising dinner. ‘

It is one of five open conferen-
ces that are a part ofthe Counsel-

ing and Student Development

TheReaI way To FindA Job?

Center‘s annual Career Seminar

Series.

Each table is flllL‘d_ with an
array of slick promotional mate-
rial. and the earnest presence ofa
representative from the real
world of work. Some sit alone
and scan the crowd. while other
representatives. mostly from gla-
mour trades such as news broad-
casting and maga7ine writing.
look- frantic as they try to pay
attention to six or seven future

job-seekers at the same time.
the same time.

“There aren‘t any jobs here."
said Teddy Faklcs. a member of
Pitt’s Counseling Center and
coordinator of the seminar.
“This isn't a recruiting effort.
Our purpose is to provide infor-
mation on what is out there. and
different ways that a person can
prepare for a particular career.”

While most representatives
would agree with Fakles’assess-

t'nminut'd on page .\.i.\'

Although campus police always
respond immediately to a fire or
smoke call. resources other than the
fire department may be called in.
Watter said.

“With all the labs we have going
here. there are confusing odors com-
ing out of rooms." Watters said. “A
person may smell something they've

‘never smelled in that building
before. It may turn out to be
nothing. If its electrical. we call an
electrician; if it’s steam, we’ll call a
heating engineer." .

Pittsburgh Fire Chief Charles
Lewis condemned the procedure.

“We certainly disapprove of any-
body. especially police. not calling
the fire department immedi_ately‘."
Lewis responded when told about
the campus police system. "l can't
imagine what the hell they were
doing."

Regarding the six-minute delay.
Lewis said. “Its a lifetime when
there's fire involved." J

Chief Lewis speculated that the
number of false alarms at the univer-
sity might be a source ofembarrass-
ment to the police.

“But that’s no reason to delayy‘a
call while police check it out." he
said. “We have no problem respond-
ing. no matter how many falses there
are. Tl_1at’s our job.”

Fire Captain John Pelkofer. who i

was the acting battalion chief at Fri-
day's fire. agreed with Lewis.

Low Staffing

Center Changes

D By MARY KANE

Students served by the College of
Arts and Sciences advising center
who miss any combination of two
advising and registration appoint-
ments may find themselves register-
ing late and paying a‘ penalty fee
under the cerifers new “no-show"
policy. according to David Luedde.
the center’s assistant director.

‘In the past. if a student missed an

‘advising or registration appoint-

ment. he or she could reschedule it in
time for registration. But because
the center is currently operating
three positions short-—which trans-‘
lates into about a 300-student
overload the center will not be able
to reschedule the student imme-
diately because of the backlog the
missed appointments cause.

Next tcrm‘s staffing situation at
the center may worsen further if a

six advising positions isn’t imple-

Pitt’s Bond Sellers Finally Meet

After months of delay. the Alle-

Assistance Authority. the group that
will help Pitt finance its building
projects. held its organizational
meeting in the county courthouse
Monday.

The new authority will aid Pitt by
selling bonds tothe publicthcnturn—

to defray costs of the projects. such
as the renovation of Schenley Hall
and the construction of a Graduate
School of Business building and a
fraternity housing complex.

The meeting was attended by
representatives from the county
development office. the county com-
missioners office. the chief clerks
office and the county law depart-
ment as well as outside county
representatives. \

Officers were elected and commit-
tees delegated for proposal of by-
laws and fee schedules and

lhe new authority. which falls
under the‘ county development
office. will serve as a “financing vehi-
cle" for Pitt. allowing the university
to benefit from the tax—exempt
bonds or notes that it issues. This
could result in a savings of 2 to 3
percent for the university. the group
said. ‘

As described by its members. the
authority functions by issuing bonds
or notes to the public. The pur-
chaser. usually an investment
banker. is loaning the money to the
university through the authorityat a
stated interest rate. The advantage.
they explained. is that the issues are

ﬁnd natural gas and crude oil, but to discover '
energy alternatives such as the liqueﬁcation and
gasification of coal, oil shale, and tar sands.

going through a municipal
authority.

Pitt is required to back the issues
and repay them. County residents
are in no way liable. the group said.

The university turned to the new
authority due to lack of funding
from the state. according to Senior
Vice—Chancellor for Administration
Jack Freeman. He said Pitt hasn“t
recieved any major funds for con-
struction. projects since l975. the
Pennsylvania General State Author-
ity. the usual source of the funds.
couldn‘t be relied upon. Freeman
said.

As 21. result. the university urged
the county commissioners to estab-
lish the Allegheny County authority.

A similar authority t.‘.\.isIs in Cené
tre County that helps Perm State

finance its( projects. Six projects
totaling ‘$20.4 million have been
undertaken by Centre County

authority. according to Ken Babe.

Penn State‘s assistant v ice president.
The average interest on the Centre
County issues has been l0.25 per-
cent. he said.

undertaken by the Centre County
officials to learn from their
experiences.

The group also noted that local
banks have expressed interest in the
program. Community College of
Allegheny County. they said. is also
“vitally interested" in using the
authority. Currently. Pitt is the only
scheduled beneficiary.

The Pitt campus police‘s inability
to obtain an approved labor repre-
sentative is a major frustration in the
force, according to Sgt. James Ches-
ter of the campus police.

The campus police have gone
without a labor representative for
the past two years. They were for-
merly affiliated with the United
Plant Guard Workers of America
(UPGWA) but were a social
member of the Fraternal Order of
Police (FOP).

In the spring of I979, the campus
police petitioned the Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Board (PLRB) to
have the FOP also represent them as
a collective bargaining organization.

After a series of hearings, the
PLRB ruled that Pitt police fall
under the guidelines of Act lll of
the state labor relations code. Under
this provision, the university’s pri-
vate police were defined as police
rather than plant guards. The cam-
pus police force could not then be a
member ofthe U PGWA and was left
without a labor representative.

An election was held last winter in
which the sergeants. detectives and
patrolmen of the force selected the
FOP as their collective bargaining
representative. ,

Themajor difference between the
two unions is that the FOP frowns
upon walkouts or strikes. Instead,
the organization sgibmits to binding
arbitration with an outside panel of
three arbitrators to settle a dispute.

  Policeseek Union

' By ROB GARDNER

The UPGWA, however. under Act
195 of the labor relations code. pro-
vides members the option of either
accepting a new offer or going on
strike in the case of a labor dispute.
Both the university and the
UPC WA are appealing the PLRB's
ruling in commonwealth court.

According to Chester, “The uni,-
versity can either carry out its appeal
and recognize the FOP. or they can
choose to carry out their appeal and
not recognize the FOP, in which
case the force would be left without
representation for an unknown
period of time.“

ln the meantime “the FOP will
pursue ways to legally obligate the
university to enter into collective
bargaining." Chester said.

there six minutes sooner, there’d
have been a lot less damage.“

Pelkofer said that heavy smoke
made it difficult to find the source of
the fire.

Chief Lewis explained why the
delay may have been critical: “lf we
get (to a fire) before the rooms fill
with smoke. we have a better chance
of finding the source. We have a lot
of calls for an odor ofsmoke. where
if you let it go for a short time. you
have a fire.“ -

“What they (the campus police)
want to do in the meantime may be
well and good." Lewis added. “But
we must be called immediately." .

Lt. Watters said that the first
effort of the campus pOl|CC when a
fire is detected is evacuation of the
affected area. He said that the offic-

ers at the Faculty Club immediately-

cleared everyone out of the building
and “sealed off the entrances" so
that no one could enter.

“We try and clear all access so that

he said. "Officers do possess air
packs if people are discovered to
be inside. that equipment will be
utilized.”

According to Faculty Club
employees. they saw smoke coming
from a light fixture shortly after 0-
p.m. Friday. They notified the club
manager. Mark Kass. who verified
their report and immediately called
the-campus police. Kass said that he
did not remember what he told the
nolice on the phone.

Captain Joseph Somma. head of
the city’s fire preventionunit. which
is investigating the fire. has deter-
mined that it was accidental with no
evidence of city fire code violations.
He said that it was started by a
“grease accumulation” behind grill
and oven units in the Faculty Club
kitchen.

the fire department arrived. Accord-
ing to employees. Kass assisted
police in the immediate evacuation
of the building. He remained inside
for I0 to I5 minutes. shortly after
which the first fire engines arrived.

Somma said that asbestos insula-
tion. installed years earlier during.
construction. had deteriorated. The
faulty insulation allowed heat to
build up in the accumulated grease
until it ignited.

According to Somma. the city fire
code requires regular cleaning of fil-
ters and .duct work which carry
fumes and grease from the grills. He
said that they had been cleaned on
Friday by a commercial firm. The
only way the fire might have been
prevented. Somma said. would have
been to tear out the duct work.
which is not required by the code.

Advising Changes

their advisers in advance. Luedde
said. ’

“Students should keep their advis-
ing and registration appointments.
and if they can‘t make it. should call
in advance.” Luedde said. “lf they
don’t. it could create problems for
them. ‘

“We don‘t have any other choice.
We just don’t have enough advisers
to handle everyone."

The center is also asking students-

who have 45 or more credits and
who have an intended CAS major to
declare their major a semester early.
Luedde said. Those students would
be served by departmental advisers
rather than the CAS advising staff.

_The advising center lost funding
for some of its positions when the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences was
forced to cut $850000 from its
budget as a result of a university-
widc tax on all academic
departments.

Career Seminar

c0nn'nu£’d_/'r0In page one

ment, a number of students
seemed to be confused. or to
have missed the point of the
whole thing.

One student. when asked what
she thought she might get out of
the seminar. replied: “A job.
what else‘? l know about resumes
and what I want to do; why else
would I come here if I wasn‘t
looking for work‘.’“

The representatives confirmed
the fact that most students knew
what they wanted to do and were
prepared to compete for jobs
once they reached graduation.

“l have seen a lot ofkidstwo or
three years into an undergradu-
ate program." said Mark
Kosovec ofTouche Ross and Co.
“They come in with a combina-
tion of curiosity and anxiety.

A They know what they want to do.

but the market is tough. and
they’re worried."

According to statistics and
reports from the trenches. the

- real world is not the most hospit-

able place for a recent college
graduate, especially if he is not V
trained in a specific career
discipline. ’

A report available at the
seminar lists 60 job categories
and estimates the annual

.demand for these jobs between

I976 and I985. The position with
the greatest number of projected
yearly openings was secreta-
tary, stenographer with 295.()()().
Bookkeeping workers came in a
distant second with 95.()()() pm-
jected' annual openings. and
nursing aides. orderlies and
attendants placed third with
83,000 new slots.

Careers more often associated
with the typical holder of a B.A.
or  were in painfully short
supply: chemists. b.3()(l;
mathematicians. l.(l()(): news-
paper reporters. 2.l()(l. Histori-
ans bottom out the list with a
mere 900 new positions a year.

The company representatives
themselves illustrate the bleak-
ness of opportunity in their sales
pitches.

One man. Andrew J. Mon-
tana. the senior district sales
manager for Allstate lnsurance.
said his company had a great
many opportunities for young
people fresh out of college. He
went on to say that no one in the
firm made less than $20,000 a

By ALISON HIGHBERGER

The main lobby of Schenley Hall on Monday afternoon: students weary from too much weekend partying and tired from the
morning’s classes are slumped in chairs watching people and snoozing. its warm and crowded and sounds like a cocktail party;
conversation and music blend to a constant low murmur.

Nothing unusual. right’? But for something different this week. add Bugs Bunny. Betty Boop and Daffy Duck to the scene.

Hundreds of animation eel paintings are on display and sale through Wedneday evening in the Student Union.

A eel is a painting which is photographed to make a frame in an animated film. When a cartoon is being made. the characters
are drawn onto a large sheet of transparent acetate by an artist. The eel is then hand-painted. In one feature—length cartoon.
there may be as many as 30,000 eels. S .

While other peoplejust browsed through the stacks of Walt Disney. Warner Brothers and Ralph Bakshi cartoon art. Timothy
Kelley quietly pulled out his wallet and prepared to buy four eels. including pictures of Flash Gordon and Daffy Duck. fora
total of $l00. - g

“I love cartoon art. it's what I grew up with." said Kelley. a Duquesnejunior. Kelley said he watches cartoons on Channel 53
in the afternoons and gets up at 6:30 every Saturday morning to watch Black Star.

Kelley. an editorial cartoonist for The Duquesne Duke, is also a collector of comic books. original movie posters. videotapes
of cartoons and bubble gum cards. “My room looks like a museum," he said. ’ '

Kelley added that eels are a good investme_nt. S

“Cels appreciate well and will do so especially when computers are used more in animation." said Wanda Steitz. sales
representative for Gallery Lainzberg in Cedar Rapids. Iowa. which is putting on the exhibit and sale. —

Steitztravels with the show to colleges and universities all over the eastern United Statesand said that the eels sell well.

Why is this art form so popular‘? » '

“How many pieces of original art can you get by a known artist like Chuck Jones (a Warner artist. now 70. who is considered
one of America's foremost animators) for only $35. Not many. And you own a piece ofthe actualfilm you see on the screen.“
Steitz said. A 5

She said that Gallery Lainzberg buys eels .directly from the studios so the money goes right back into studio production
budgets. i ’

“In effect. we're directly subsidizing-good cartoon art." she said. A

Steitz said that among the student crowd the most popular eels portray Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck.-and characters from Star
Trek and Ralph Bakshi’s Wizards. Professors and the older crowd tend to prefer the Walt Disney characters, she said. but “Betty
Boop is a favorite of everyone.“ The cels range in price from $35 for a head of Bugs Bunny to $l75 for a_ signed limited edition: ‘

Jim Baker, a Pitt sophomore pharmacy student and fan of Bugs Bunny and the Road runner. was looking at a eel painting of
Bugs from A Connecticut Rabbit in King Arthur's Court. a \

“I remember that one," he said. “I still watch cartoons once in a while—as a release of energy and as an escape.”

But was» he going to splurge and buy a eel‘? B A C

“They’re great collector’s pieces, but I don‘t have the bucks." Baker said.

Opinion

LA PLUS    
Or Minus?

The state is offering a new plan to help
college students caught in the seam
between eligibility for aid or loans and the
ability to Dav cash for an education.

The plan‘ is called PLUS, Parental
Loans for Undergraduate Students. Sim-
ilar to the guaranteed student loan pro-
gram, PLUS makes $2,500 per year in
loan money available to the parents of
college undergraduates. Once the loan is
secured, the parent must begin repayment
within 60 days at 14 percent interest.

, According to Thomas Fabian, deputy
director of the Pennsylvania Higher Edu-
cation Assistance Agency, the new feder-
al__ly sponsored program being
administered by The state is attracting a
great deal ‘of attention among families of

"students ineligible for aid or loans and
unable to afford the full cost of college.

Due to recent restrictions on eligibility
for the guaranteed student loans (a
$30,000 maximum family income) and
cutbacks in the various grant and aid pro-
grams, a new class of students from
middle-income families is left without
options when it comes to selecting a
college—they must base their decision on
pricerather than quality.

Given these circumstances, it is ques-
tionable whether the PLUS program pro-
videsiany meaningful assistance to this
class of college students. One aspect of the
guaranteed student loan program -that
made it especially attractive to the
middle-income families was that the loan
did not come due. until the student fin-
ished school. ' _.

By merely providing, another loan

" option to these families, the government
is doing little to ease the financial burden
that has become the primary threat to
their channels of educational access.

Despite the potential of PLUS, or any
similar program, the basic problem
remains—quality higher‘ education‘ is
more and more becoming an option for
the very rich or the very poor, while the
middle class can only shop for bargains
and hope for better times.

Pharmacy And The Nuclear Threat

Dear Editor: .

Physicians internationally have
begun to speak out against the threat
of nuclear war?-the ultimate disas-
ter. They have thrown their profes-
sional weight and knowledge toward

, enlightening the public to the fore-

most danger to our people’s health.
If future pharmacy professionals
really hope to play a broader and
more constructive role in health
care. we must join the medical peo-
ple and address ourselves to this
unthinkable event.

The crucial character of the issue
calls upon our moral and ethical
obligation to:

0 speak out;

0 dispel the notion furnished by
the advocates of the arms race that

‘nuclear war is inevitable;

0 recognize the unacceptable
danger ofthe slidcto World War lll;
' 0 fulfill the historical role of‘the
pharmacist in maintaining the

Column

health ofthe masses of people. (Even
in their early role centuries ago.
apothecaries were the sole medical
resource for the poor masses. in con-
trast to the rich whom the doctors
served.)

We cannot encourage indifference
or insensitivity to this overriding
issue. When the supply and delivery

of necessary drugs would be virtu-

ally cut off in nuclear war. we dare

not dismiss it as a “neglected ques-
tion." The survival of the human
species is at stake.

There are those who would argue.
either from apathy or indifference
or mispereeptions that we are being
alarmist or hysterical. But the facts
speak forithemselves. Let our con-
sciences speak for us!

Pizza Story Has Crust

In the Sept. 25 Pin News . there
was an article on the pizza shops in
Oakland. The article really didn’t
discuss the quality of the pi77.a: it

talked about the quality of the pizza-

shops. So what if people speak ltal-
ian. and you can’t understand them‘?

-What's wrong with a little bit of

culture?

And if people are really hungry.
do you think they’re really going to
care ifthe place isorange‘? You don't
go to a pizza shop for the atmos-

phere but for the pizza. so what‘s the
big deal? Is the atmosphere really
better at McDonald’s‘.’

/When did The Pitt News get a
“Food Editor?" I can‘t really critte-
ize the food editor‘s ability. because
this article really didn't discuss food
but the interior design of the pizza
shops. Maybe the author should be
titled “Interior Decorator!“

The Legislation of Morality

BY MARK COLLINS
The Abortion Controls Act. co-

sponsered by Rep. Taddonio of
Westmoreland. is now before the
Pennsylvania House of Representa-
tives. In effect‘. the writers ofthe bill
are attempting to legislate ethics in
regard to abortion.

Many issues intertwine in abor-
tion. The “right to life“ has become a
cliche used by both sides. It implies
that life. from the beginning of
“humaness." has certain entitle-
ments: conversely. it also implies
that the right to one‘s health cannot
be threatened or abridged by law.

The sponsors of the bill insist that
the rights of the woman are not
infringed. and that the bill is aimed
at protecting the health of both the
mother and the child.

I~‘irstl_\'. the bill is aimed at con-
trolling abortions. By definition.
this means regulating abortions.
Once passed. the status ofa woman‘s
rights would change drastically
simply by the nature of the legisla-
tion. lfrights are controlled. they are
infringed. There are. however. legiti-
mate infringements of rights: people
are not allowed to yell fire in a thea-
ter. nor should they be. Whether the.
transgression of rights is legitimate
in the abortion .bill is another
matter.

Secondly, while the bill‘s sponsors

‘intended. in part, to “protect the

right of the child." they do so with-
out defining “ehild." In this way. the
sponsors have skirted the central
issue of the abortion question. _
Additionally. doctors are
required by the bill‘s provisions to
inform the woman about the abor-
tion. detailing the proceedings.
actual surgery and results. Perhaps
the most controversial element of
the legislation involves the use of
color photographs of aborted
fetuses as evidence of the results of

‘an abortion.

To the bill's supporters. the intent
of this section is to inform those
ignorant of ahortion‘s effects. The
hills targeted group. according to
('hristopher Dixon of the Greens-
burg Chapter of the People (‘on-
ccrncd For the Unborn Child are
adolescents thus another provi-
sion's requirement of parental per-
mission for underage abortions. But

the information section will apply to
all pregnant women. notjust teenag-
ers.' To humilate a mature woman
with photographs or the ideaof
photographs should not be a part
of legislation.

Lawmakers have been struggling
with the question of abortion for
many years now. Legislation so far
has been arbitrary at best. The com-
plexities of the issue of. where life
begins seem to outnumber our tech-
nological advances. We are guess-
ing. really. at a most basic question;
the myst_ery of life itself. ‘

Yet while this is a difficult ques-
tion. the pro-lifers now act prepared
to answer it. But they are armed with
the same information. with the same
medical facts. They are no more
enlightened than those who tried to
answer this question before.

As Prohibition proved. we ha\e
always been a country that was poor
in legislating morals and ethics. We
seem no better at it now

The Past and Present Pitt and Community Relations 

The Oakland



attl

During a period that began in the
mid-l950s and ended in the early
1970s. Pitt expanded rapidly—»
adding a record number of students,

programs and buildings to its urban:

campus— in an effort to create a
more diverse and sophisticated
university. T

While the effort was successful for
the most part. Pitt’s physical expan-
sion during this period caused a
major problem between the univer-
sity and community.

This physical expansion. which

‘almost doubled the university’s size

of4 million square feet in l960 to 7.5_
million in I978. was responsible for
displacing people and businesses
and taking millions ofdollars offtax
rolls. lt also created traffic conges-
tion. housing shortages. deteriora-

 tion. noise and litter in a once-serene

neighborhood. o
' Although this breathless expajn-V

I ‘sion has come to a halt. a new con-

frontation between the university
and community is emerging with the
implementation of the Oakland
Plan.

This time. however. there are

signs of cooperation between the

university’s Office of Public Affairs.

M the community‘s People‘s Oakland

group. and the umbrella organiza-

tion that includes all ofthe commun-_

ity’s institutional. commerce and
residential groups~~ Oakland Direc-
tions lncorporated.’ ‘»

A look at the past

Thanks to generous funding from

the state and private endowments

from families that included the Mel-
lons. Scaifes. Falks. Hunts‘. Hill-
mans. and Benedums,,Pitt had little
trouble funding its projects during

the ’50s and ’o0s. The university‘
‘doubled

in size ac uirinr most

   

  

property through either the General i
State Authority (GSA) or private
donations.«Often when Pitt desig-
nated a piece of property as part of
its expansion plan. itdid not matter

. who or what.happenedto be in the

way.

An example of this disregard
occurred when Pitt purchased two
luxurious ‘residential buildings.
Schcnley Hall Hotel and Bruce Hall
Hotel. in I953 and converted them
into a student union and an under-
graduate dorm. M t

“They told people to‘ move out on
just a few months‘ notice," recalls a
long-time Oakland resident. “They
practically kicked them ‘out on the
streets. People were so angry that
they took the «University of Pitts-i
burgh out of their wills.“ = '

By i959. the purchase of property
was causing unrest in the business
community. 1’ ’

“If decisive_action is not taken
immediately to stop Pitt from grab-
bing up every ‘parcel of valuable
property. in Oakland. it won‘t be
long before Pittsburgh will be
"reduced to‘ a college town." said
Oakland businessman Albert Piper
in a l959 interview with the Oakland
News. ~

But no organized opposition had
formed. and as long as funds were
coming in. it seemed that nothing
could stop Pitt. under the direction
of Chancellor Edward Litchfield.
from transforming Oakland into a
educational and cultural Utopia.
One of these plans proposed the fil-
ling in of Panther Hollow. the
jagged ‘I000-foot-wide ravine in
Oakland.:with' a seven-level build-
ing. The building would have
housed. among other things. a $250
million university research center.

came to Pitt in I937. “He wanted to
do it in a great hurry. His ambitions
went further than available funds.

“Litchfield wanted excellence in
everything and could visualize Pitt
as another Cornell."

According to Pitt‘s I960 Master
Plan. it ultimately planned to aquire
all the property between Bouquet
Street and Oakland Avenue.

“This extensive strip will be lands-
caped. and equipped with off-street
parking space for about L300 cars.“
said a Pitt spokesman after the
plan's releasgto the public. “Forbes
Field will be torn down. and a good
chunk of Oakland's business section
will be ~ra7.ed.” M
‘ In I963. despite its ambitious
plans. Pitt received bad .news from
the state. Gov. William Scranton
advised the university. which was
still a private institution. that the
time had come for the state to stop
paying for new buildings and other
facilities on the Pitt campus.

This meant that Pitt would have
had to pay the GSA over $l million a
year for projects already proposed.
including ‘a new dental clinic and
Benedum and Clapp halls.

“We cannot believe that Harris-
burg is going to do this.“ said a Pitt
spokesman in reply to the govcrnor‘s
statement. “Such a move will have
catastrophic and paralyzing effect
on our efforts to assist in the rebirth
of Western Pennsylvania."

during the 1950s and 1960s. According to one report this building, which was to have
become a reality before 1970, would also house an extension of the Carnegie Art Museum
three theaters, restaurants and shops. Last year, it was suggested by a city councilman

as

‘ that this same 1000-loot-wide ravine be tilled with dirt, paved and made into a parking lot.

- attack and resigned in l9h5. Despite

his resignation. l.itchfield’s dream of
transforming Oakland continued to
take shape. i

“In a phrase. the excitement is ris-

-ing.“ said Acting Chancellor David

Kurtyman in l9tio. “in the coming
years. with two major universities.
our own and Carnegie Tech (now
Carnegie-Mellon University) Oak-
land will become a virtual Athens. lt
will be a better place to visit. to live
and work in. And lhopc to do busi-
ness in (it)."

The excitement soon became too
much for Pitt to handle alone.
Pressed for funds. the university
became state—related in I966.

Enrollment began expanding
rapidly. outstripping available stu-
dent housing and academic facili-
ties. and another Master Plan
seemed necessary and feasible.

The $128 Million Plan

In the late l9o()s. Pitt umeiled an
cxtcnsixc |3—\o|ume. S128 million
Master Plan.

In this plan. the uni\'crsity pro-
posed to build a Sl3 million dormi-
tory on uni\'crsit_\‘—o\\‘ncd property
on the hillside bctvs-sen Pitt Stadium

and the Schcnley Farms residential
area to facilitate the growing student
housing needs.

The plans also proposed the pur-
chase of properties adjacent to the
university's lower campus, including
the acquisition of Forbes Field and
property along Bouquet Street
downjoncaire and onto Boundary
Street.

This project was to be built by

USA in four stages from l969-75.-

Thirteen businesses. three city
streets. two apartment buildings and
dozens of homes would be obliter-
ated and replaced by a series of inter-
connected buildings to house the
schools ofcducation. social sciences.
library and information sciences.
law. humanities. business and public
and international affairs.

Community reaction followed the
publication of the plan. and it led to
the formation ofcommunity organi-
7ations. such as People‘s Oakland.
to express the community's
concerns.

Sandra Phillips. People‘s Oakland
coordinator. “They held public

meetings to protest and drew people

from all over Oakland." H
By i969, Pitt had a new chancellor

named Wesley Posvar. and plans_

were laid for the relocation of busi-
nesses and tenants displaced by the
various projects.

“People from the GSA khocked

on people's doors and said ‘we‘re

taking your house by eminent
domain.’ “ recalls Phillips. “People

and those who didn't got low

Along Bouquet Street and Oak-
land.Avenue. the houses of ‘families
who were relocated were board_ed up
and left to decay. while other houses

had signs in their windows that read: .
“This House Not For Sale."

The elections of Mayor Pete Fla-
herty and Milton Shapp also put a
crimp in Pitt’s plans for expansion.

“Flaherty. who. was independent
of the city machine. grew concerned
with‘ the declining tax base in Oak-
la_nd and received a lot of pressure
from the neighborhood groups.“
says Jay Roling. vice chancellor of
Pitt’s_ Office of Public Affairs.
“Shapp. while recognizing the neces-
sity to accommodate educational
needs.,.was also sensitive to the needs
of the little people."

As a result. the project fell two
years behind schedule. Pitt lost
money. and in l97l. People‘s Oak-
land rallied successfully to preserve
the .Oakland Avenue. Bouquet
Street and Brackenridge Street
neighborhoods. ‘

Pitt. agreeing to build on land
instead of streets. modified its pro-
ject. and what resulted were the con-
troversial Forbes Quadrangle and
the School of.l.aw.

buildings. it's workable on the inside

expansion that take a huge chunk
out of tuition dollars.“ says Roling
in defending Forbes Quadrangle.
often criticized as being inefficient.

obsolete and aesthetically displeas-

ing. “its a building that has to be

judged from the inside out."

Pitt Making Strides

Both Roling and Phillips agree
that Pitt7s current ' administration
has made strides in maintaining bet-
ter relations with the community.

“The sensitivity to community
problems has been its highest under

Chancellor Posvar," says Roling. “i
think over the years both sides have
managed to deal better together.
We’ve had plans discussed with the
community and acknowledged their
concerns.”

“I think the university.adrninistra-
tion is making an effort to work with
community groups in a much more
positive way than they have in the
past." says Phillips. “So far. how-
ever. the results are uneven."

There are.Oakla_nd residents who

had on the community.

“Many people in the community
feel they’ve been raped by the uni-

versity." says an Oakland resident. ‘

“Its been a piece-by—piece destruc-
tion. Forbes Field was torn down.
friends and neighborsiwere relo-
cated. and family-run businesses
were turned into fast-food
restaurants."

While Roling says there will
always be negative sentiments by
some people toward a university or
large institution. he adds that. in
Pitt‘s case. more aggravation set in
with the move ofthe Pirates to Three

‘Rivers Stadium and the symphony
.to Heinz Hall. t

“Residents were disappointed and
frustrated.” says Roling. “All they
were left with was a university in the
midst of expansion and student
protest.”

Much of the leftover bitterness
towardfthe university can be traced
to the proliferation ofabsentee land-
lords and speculators out to make an
easy dollar on the demand for stu-
dent housing during the late l96()s.

“The university never lifted a fin-
ger to deal with absentee landlords."
says another resident. “They made

P very little effort to inform students

of apartment buildings violating

health and fire codes."

This problem is serious and pain-
ful to those who see the reminders of
it every daytin the form of decaying
and unkempt buildings. .

“Year after year students rent
apartments in buildings with code
violations. health violations." says.
Phillips. "The universitycould make
a more conscious effort to let stu-
dents know this through student
goxernment or newspapers."

According to Roling. it would be
to Pitt's advantage in attracting both
students and faculty to have a nice

“The university supports the strict
enforcement of health and safety
codes for off-campus housing; how-
ever. if we enforced it today. we’d
-find 4,000 students out on the
street." says Roling. explaining the

university's dilemma. “The only way i

we could do it is if-we had alternative
housing facilities available."

The way to solve the code viola-
tion and absentee landlord prob-
lems, according to Roling. is a joint
effort on the part of the university.

Although time has not eased some
of the deep resentment toward the

to the point where a joint planning

forced Pitt to modify its building plans in South Oakland,
with the results including the completion of the often-

criticized Forbes Quadrangle. ‘

but the practical Oakland Plan takes -

the community as it is and attempts
to make it work better by upgrading
the quality of its life.

The plan is a culmination of a
four-year extensive planning pro-
cess for the best utilization ofdwin—
dling space and funds as well as the
renovation of Oakland.

The five main goals targeted in the
plan include: stabilizing and upgrad-
ing residential neighborhoods; facil-
itating institutional self-renewal in
response to growth and change;
developing a comprehensive trans-
portation system; and improving
public safety and creating a sense of
personal security.

The plan avoids deep surgery with
its ﬂexible guidelines and contro -

versy by mapping out both the fixed

areas and opportunity areas in
Oakland; ‘
Dealing specifically with Pitt‘s

urgent need forvstudent housing, the}

plan recommends both tighter con-
trol and regulation of off-campus
student housing and a design of stu-
dent housing that is acceptable to
both the university and the
community. »

Getting Oakland back on its feet is
serious business. and both Phillips
and Roling agree it will take
cooperation. . . .

With state funding cutbacks and a
projected enrollment decline. Pitt no
longer thinks in terms of massive
physical expansion.

“The university’s days of rapid‘

“Pitt will not look significantly dif-

instead. Pitt will focus on the ren-
ovation and rebuilding of existing

\_ facilities. including Schenley Hall.

The only new building planned in
the immediate future is the Graduate
School of Business. which will be

or Mervis Hall.

Fraternities, Hotels ‘and
Health Care

Although the community and uni-
versity are now making efforts to

. work . together—unlike the early
l970s. when the relationship was Q

dominated by conﬂict—-there are
still issues that ‘cause concern
among residents living in those

-areas. .

Two of those concerns are the

Vmajor expansion of the University
Health Care Center and the pro-
posed Oakland hotel-and-
condominium complex.

The hotel complex. which would
be built behind the Syria Mosque
and the Masonic Temple. borders
on the Schenley Farms neighbor-
hood. , -* ’

“Many feel that the hotel complex
is not appropriate in a residential
section.” says Phillips. “Second.
over 480 cars are parked there daily.
Although parking will still be availa-
ble. it will be limited—-and more
costly."

According to Phillips. the general

consensus among community "

jorganizations on the university’s
proposed fraternity housing com-

plex on University Drive next to

Falk Schoolfs playgiouhd is favor-
able. - i ‘
“We hope that the project is suc-
cessful.“ says Phillips. “It will have
no negative impact on the neighbor-
hood and represents a major step in
solving some long-term problems."

The control and regulation of off-campus housing and the rehabilitation of existing 
structures are just a few of the objectives Pitt and People's Oakland hope to accomplish

under the Oakland‘ Plan. The plan also calls for stricter onto

and health codes.

 Carolina Defense

Tough Up Front

. By JOHNETTE HOWARD

After two early-season dress
rehearsals, Pitt Panther football
coach Jackie Sherrill wants adver-
sity, his players want a real test. and
the South Carolina team is drooling
for another shot .at Pitt after last
January‘s 37-9 embarassment in the
Gator Bowl.

Saturday‘s clash between Pitt (2-
0) and South Carolina (252) prom-
ises to be a game that will satisfy all
of the above, and the nice guys at
ABC-TV will bring it home to you,
beginning at 3:50 p.m. from sold-out
William-Brice Stadium in Colum-
bia. S.C. 4

After waltzing through its first
two games and gleaning little about
the character his Panther team will
have when pressed to perform. Sher-
rill is looking forward to facing
South Carolina, if just to sate his
curiosity. The man, it seems, doesn‘t
know exactly what type ofteam he’s
got,-even with a No.4 national rank.

“South Carolina will be an excel-
lent barometer tojudge our football
team with,” Sherrill explained.
“This game will be a first for a lot of

’our players--the firstgtime they
travel, the first road game. and the
crowd will be vocal. Its going to be
an adjustment, and it’s a question
mark how they’ll handle it."

How the Panthers handle South
Carolina is expected to_,be largely

a

decided in the trenches. where the
Gamecocks return two strong. phys-
ical front lines both offensively and
defensively.

The Carolina offense, operating
out of its newly-installed triple
option. has been inconsistent so far.
causing Gamecock Coach Jim
Carlen to waver between quarter-
backs Gordon Becham and Terry
Bishop.

In the absence of Heisman
Trophy winner George Rogers,
senior Johnnie Wright has made the
conversion from fullback to tailback
smoothly. rushing for 100 yards in
the last two games.

Defensively, the Gamecocks have
had no problem with consistency---——
they‘ve been consistently good.
When Pitt's coaches aren‘t praising
the Carolina defense. Carlen is
uncharacteristically willing (for a
coach) to pound his chest himself.

“We're a better defensive team

‘than’ we were a year ago. We‘ve

played strong so far,” Carlen said.
Leading the Gamecock defense is
a strong, physical front line.

Emanuel Weaver a.nd junior left

By JOHNETIE HOWARD '

Besides turning linemen’s and
runnin_gback’s bones to sand,
with his
breath and threatening to shell-
shock everything in his path,
what other pressures does a
mean, strong and quick nose-
guard put on»-an~offensive center
when they line up head to head‘?

How about putting the game
on the line‘? That’s the assessment
of 6-3, 267-pound center Emil
Boures going into Saturday‘s
game against 6-4, 255-pound

middle guard Emanuel Weaver‘

and the South Carolina
Gamecocks.

“Personally, I think l have to
have a good game against
Weaver for us to win," Boures
said yesterday. “He’s the type of
player that can dominate a game.
He’s positioned in the middle,
and he makes things happen.“

After going bleary—eyed
watching reelafter reel of Caro-
lina game film. often starring
Weaver including his l2-tackle
performance against Georgia
last week Boures was left with
one distinct impression: Weaver
shapes up to be the challenge of
his career.

“He‘s probably the best l’ve
gone up against in my four years
here," Boures said simply.

Considering Boures has faced

Cleveland Crosby, it's a strong
assessment. ' _

A quick check on Weaver‘s
statistics from last year shows 99
tackles and one sack in his first
season of major college football.
What’s more frightening—- it was
also just his first year at
noseguard.

Before shifting his terrorizing
act to Carolina, Weaver was a
junior college All-America tight

end at Arizona Western Junior ,
College. South Carolina Coach‘

Jim Carlen calls him “one ofthe
best athletes on the team" and
the team’s defensive leader.

Boures is similarly impressed.

“He's very strong and he’s
quick. He can make plays on the
outside if you don’t stay with
him." Boures said. “He’s the
toughest player l’ll play all year.
Every team that‘s played him has
double-teamed him. Nobody has
stopped him."

According to Pitt Coach
Jackie Sherrill. Boures may get
some help with Weaver Satur-
day. but for the majority of the
game. he’ll be on his own.

“Emil Boures is going to have
a contest.” Sherrill said. “Emil is
a good football player. Saturday,
we'll see how good he is."

Despite being trumpeted for
All-America honors at center.
Boures enters just his third game
at the position Saturday. After
spending his first three years at

Weaver Ba ttfe Key for Boures  

spring to _fill the gaping hole left
by Russ Grimm‘s‘~departure to
the NFL. During his Pitt career,
Boures has played all five offen-
sive line spots.

Since setting in at center this
season, Boures said the adjust-
ment has gone well.

“I feel comfortable with the
position now," said Boures.
“Since our first game, Coach
(Joe) Moore has worked on my
stance and worked on my tech-
nique with me. We've changed
some things. and it’s helping."

According to Boures. the feed-
back from the coaches on his
adjustment to center has been
favorable. too. .

“Everything th_ey’ve asked me
to do. l‘ve done so far. We been
picking up my assignments, so l
think they‘re satisfied,” Boures
said.

Boures has done little to dis-
satisfy his coaches in the last few
years. He hasn’t allowed aquar-
terhack sack in two seasons and.
along with .limbo Covert, ranks
as one of the strongest members
of the Pitt team. Boures" ability
to switch positions readily has
caught the pro scouts‘ notice,
ttiti.

“He has tremendous ability to
atljiist." Moore said. f'Wc feel
Emil can be one of the finest cen-
ters in the country."

ln yesterday afternoonfs blus-
tery-weather. the Indiana Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania
stickwomen blew out the hopes
of the Pitt Lady Panther field
hockey team, leaving the Lady
Panthers on the dark side ofa 4—l
score. L

The loss levels the Lady
Panthers’ ledger to 2-2_ as they
head into the toughest road trip
of the season.

Pitt held a I-0 halftime lead on
the strength of a Margie Hall
goal. But frequent breakdowns
in communication caused the
Pitt offense to be ineffective most
of the second half. and the Lady
Panther defense faltered under
lndiana‘s assault.

“Things just didn‘t go right in
the second half," said Coach
Cindy DiGiacomo. “It was like

Pitt Men 7th
In Eastern 8

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

The men‘s tennis team traveled
to the University of Rhode Island
for the Eastern 8 tournament. but
they might as well not have made the
trip. Of the eight teams entered. Pitt
ﬁnished-seventh. beating out only
St. Bonaventure.

As expected, West Virginia won
the tournament. going away with
33.5 points. whiie George Washing-
ton ﬁnished second with 25. Pitt tal-
lied l2‘/3 points. ,

The Mountaineers’ victory was no
surprise, especially to Pitt tennis
coach George Dieffenbach.

“WVU has eight scholarships to
offer (to tennis players) while we
don’t'have any. so it’s obvious that
they have quality players.” Dief—
fenbach said. i

Making the best showing for Pitt
was the doubles team of Lance Falce
and Allen Grossman. The twosome
ﬁnished ﬁfth in the No. 3 doubles
category. V ‘

-Falce and Grossman started off
by defeating a St. Bonaventure team

Q

Bill of Rights?....

Sometime in the future. the sce-
nario could be like this: College ath-
letes all over the country went on
strike today. claiming their share of
TV revenue has not been handled
properly.

The Center for Athletes’ Rights
and Education. a one-month-old
organization. in conjunction with
the National Football League Play-
ers Association has introduced a bill
of rights for scholastic and collegiate

athletes. Some of the provisions for

the Athlete‘s Bill of Rights include:
0 The right to a fair share of the

revenues generated by the athlete’

‘through contracts. gate receipts.

“"*championship

contests and
merchandising.

0 The right to form unions and
bargain collectively on all issues
affecting financial aid and working
conditions.

0 The right to legal assistance and
due-process in disputes with athletic
departments and coaches.

O The right to a multi-year grant-
in-aid to allow athletic to complete
their degrees even if seriously in-

jurcd.

0 The right to remedial courses
and counseling geared to quality
education and not athletic ability.

0 The right to a letter of intent
outlining in detail the school’s finan-
cial obligation to the student.athlctc.\

The amateur days aredyingaway.

Boyarsky is back. . ..

Jerry Boyarsk_v. Former Pitt
noseguard. has begun workouts and
New Orleans Saints Coach Bum
Phillips indicated that Boyarsky
could be reactivated this week.

- Boyarsky. who was impressive in
the pre-season. injured his knee and
was placed on the injured reserve.
Boyarsky had won a starting spot.

The publicity that eluded starting
New Orleans linebacker Ricky Jack-
son at Pitt has suddenly come in
droves. During one pre-season game

against the Eagles. the announcers
praised him for [0 minutes. Now.
Inside Sports has a big story on
Ricky Jackson and his hometown of
Pahokkee. Fla.

Lee runs Great Race...

Margie Lee. a senior at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. and a member
of the track and cross country teams
finished fourth in the Great Race on
Sunday. Lec‘s time_ was 37:45.

The senior from Point Bree‘/e ran
the (lrcat Race for the fourth
straight year. l.ast year. she finished
fifth in the race with a time of 37:30.
But Leevfelt both times were equal.
“This _vear‘s course is longer so it
evens out." she said.

lt‘s a wonder she even ran at all.
l.ee broke both of her femurs last
year and “was told to take a 0-month
la_voff. The fractures were caused by
the stress ofexeessive running. Little
wonder she runs 4-l() miles a day.
Margie Lee however. came back

was the closest margin of victory for
Charleston inits ll winsthis season.

“They beat Duquesne 8-1. and
Duquesne beat us.earlier this year.
Our team is playing much better
(now).” Dieffenbach said. “After
singles, we were 3-3 with them, but
they iust had more depth."

Dieffenbach said the addition of
Lacaria to the team shouid give the
Lady Panthers a boost in both sin-
gles and doubles. Lacaria just
recentlyjoined the team after regain-
ing her eligibility. thanks to a ruling
by the Association for lntercoile—
giate Athletics for Women‘s Eligibii—
ity Committee. >

There was a question over
whether Lacaria had used a year of
eligibility when she was on the Pitt
track team several years ago. The
AIAW ruled that Lacaria did not
since she did not compete due to an
injury. I

Lacaria‘s win against Charleston
was her second in two attempts in
the singles competition. Although
she and Goltz dropped their doubles
match Sunday. Dieffenbach feels
that. with some more work. Lacaria
can help shore up Pitt's No. 2 ‘ou-
bles spot.

The next test comes today when
the Lady Panthers travel to Slippery

Some thoughts:

0The Pitt Panthers. currently No.
4 in the nation. had better watch it
Saturday against South Carolina.
The Panthers have a. habit of flab-
bing games when they go down
south. Last year. the Panthers went
to Florida State and gave away the
game and. as it turned out. the
national championship.

Saturday‘s game time has been
moved up to 3:5(l,p.m. for regional
TV coverage by ABC. The game will

mark the Panthers‘ fourth appear?

ance on national TV in the last two
seasons. Last year. Pitt’s games with
Boston College. Syracuse and Penn
State were televised.

One has to question ABC’s deci-
sion to televise this week’s contest
when the Pitt-West Virginia game is
rapidly shaping up as a more attrac-
tive matchup for several reasons.

The Pitt-WVU clash is a great natu-

ral rivalry. the Mountaineers have
cracked the Top 20 already this sea-
son. and West Virginia is undefeated
while South Carolina is 2-2.

After learning of ABC‘s decision
to pick up the game. the Panthers
went through a spirited practice
Tuesday. Apparently the South
Carolina players and coaches have

Good luck. South Carolina.
 0Shaft ofthe week: After piercing
“the Top 20 for, the first time in ages.
the WVU Mountaineers were
dropped out after they BEAT Colo-
rado State 49-3. Apparently WVU is
shorter in stature than in talent.

Who says there is no politics in the
polls‘? What other logical explana-
tion can there be after the 20th’-
ranked team in the nation is dropped
despite a lopsided victory‘?

The Mountaineers may get their
revenge. however. when Pitt visits
cozy Mountaineer Field. The Hoo-
pies should be ready and awful mad.

get by Bethany and its potent
offense, the Panthers would play
nationally-ranked Akron here in a
battle to stay undefeated. Pitt is cur-
rently ranked tenth in the East.

0Some disheartening news from
the Pitt basketball team. First, of
course, is the news that George
Allen. Pitt‘s top recruit. did not
graduate from high school and is not
yet eligible to enroll at the univer-
sity.

Allen figured prominently in
Coach,Roy Chipmanis plans. Those
plans are on hold right now.

Another unhappy note----accord-
ing to an insider. alcouple of fist
fights have broken out during bas-
ketball games that the players have
been running among themselves at
Pitt’s Field House. Maybe the play-
ers thought they were in the Eastern
8 tournament playing Duquesne. No

harm was done. but tempers have

been boiling. Chipman appears to
have recruited a feisty bunch.

Official practice for the Pitt bas— 4

ketball team begins Oct. 15.
_ 0The coffin has been buried-—-and
the Steelers aren’t in it. All those
critics who started to count out the
Steelers after the first two losses
have suddenly turned mute.

Why‘?  9

lt’s obvious to everyone that the
Pittsburgh Steelers can play the
game of football as well as anybody
and are a real threat to take it all.

Bethany‘s home turf. That started
the Panthers‘ downhill slide last
year. when they went on to lose their
last six games of the I980 season.
The Bethany squad is 1-3 on the

season. but according to Bemis. its
record is deceiving.

“Bethany is a big and strong

team." he said. “Their losses were to

I good teams. and they beat Hiram

Bethany beat Pitt last year 3-] on

College in their league opener IS-().’’

The Panther defense. headed by
senior goalie Scott Thusnberg. will
have a tough time controlling the
Bethany scoring attack.

“Bethany is returning a lot of
players who played on the team that
beat us last year.” said" Bemis. “They
have six, Division I players from

A Toronto who are exceptionally good

scorers. They will be the strongest
team we‘ve faced so far."

Bemis will rely on his consistent
defense to keepiPitt in the game. ‘
“We’re going to have to play as

strong as we can defensively." said
Bemis. “We're going to keep the
score down and try to have a good
scoring attack."

Trempus. of course. will bea part
of that Pitt defense against Bethany
tonight.

“If we stay healthy and get better
witheaeh game. we can keep win-
ning.“ said Trempus.

As long as Trempus stays healthy

play. the Panther boaters vmn’t have

Laughers Gone, Carolina Looms Ahead  

continued from page .s'i.\'teen

“South Carolina has probably the
best defensive front we'll play all
year." said Pitt offensive guard
Jimbo Covert. “Stopping the run,
they’re good. They think they've got
the people up front that have the
strength to physically beat you to get
to the quarterback.“

Pitt offensive coordinator Joe
Moore was also lavish with his
praise of the Carolina defense,
which he called “extremely tough
and aggressive.” Although Pitt ran
up l65 yards rushing against Caro-
lina in the Gator Bowl, the Panthers

did more damage through the air,
where they rang up 233 yards and

two touchdowns. To counter Pitt’s

aerial attack. Moore expects Caro-
liua to stunt and blitz on Saturday.
Often.

“Pass rush‘? l live in total fear of
that every week." Moore said..
laughing. “They have a strong defen-
sivc front and I’m quite sure they’re
going to blitz us withsomething
we‘ve never seen before from them."

ceptions so far this season. In
passing situations. Carolina will go
to a nickel defense often. shuttling in
defensive back Chuck Finney.
Although Carlen played down his
team’s lust for revenge in Saturday's
rematch. both Sherrill and Moore

i expect Carolina to enter the game

intent on recouping some pride lost
in the Gator Bowl.

“From indications we‘ve gotten
from our contacts down there,
they’ve been talking about our game
ever since the Gator Bowl.” Moore
sa-id. “They‘ll be cranked up and
coming at us."

Sherrill  betting on those Gator
Bowl memories to stir a few Caro-
lina hearts too.

“All we heard after the Gator
Bowl was how. things would be dif-
ferent when they got us in Columbia.
So you can bet the fans, players and
coaches were pointing to this game
all spring and summer.“ Sherrill
said.

A After Saturday. the waiting will
be over. And one team will still be
wanting.

PITT NOTES: Panther ﬂanker
Dwight Collins is scheduled to begin
jogging this week, but he’s still listed
as out with a pulled hamstring for
the Carolina game....Sherrill admit-
ted the southern heat could become

[ya factor in Saturday's‘game. It was
'i 85 degreesiin Columbia on Monday _

....Sherrill says‘ he is still. not com-
fortable substituting at certain posi-

’ tions because of his team’s depth.

especially on both front lines....Dan
Marine is ranked third nationally in
passingefficiency and seventh in
total offense....Split end Julius
Dawkins is first nationally, with five
touchdown catches....The Game-
cocks are 23-3-l at home under
Carlen.
