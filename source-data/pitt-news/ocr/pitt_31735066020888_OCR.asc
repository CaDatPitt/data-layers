Police
report
  gunfire
 incident

By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer

Responding to reports of a gun-
__ shot on Fifth Avenue in front of
*0.‘the Litchfield Towers, ‘Campus
Police arrested three Pittsburgh
men Saturday night, after they
tried to rob a Pitt student.
Police are looking for a fourth
suspect, who fired the gun. The
three others were charged with
robbery and criminal conspiracy.
According to Campus Police,

the studentwas walking _up»the __ _ 1;:

geps in front of Tower C when he
was approached by the four sus-
pects. One of the suspects said,
”Let’s get his rings/’.

The student was able to run
past the suspects into the Towers
lobby. He then found three of his
friends and went back outside.

‘The four students found the
suspects in front of the Towers.
One of. the suspects started walk-

gﬁtg toward them. The first student
noticed the suspect had a gun in
his hand and yelled, ”Look out,
he has a gun.”

The assailant fired the gun at
the ground, and all four suspects
ran down Fifth Avenue toward
Bouquet Street.

Campus Police picked up two
of the suspects in front of the
University Inn on McKee Street.
The third man was arrested on
Coltart Street.

Campus Police declined to

ggidentify any of the suspects (none

of whom were Pitt students) or
the students involved.

Magee hospital encourages breast exams  

By Lisa Goetz
Staff Writer

A laminated cardwith instruc-

tions on performing a self-breast,

examination while showering is
the latest educational tool being
offered by the Breast Care Cen-
'ters of Magee Women's Hospital.

”The card hangs on a shower
head andis a good reminder to

ment Board positions vowed to
dosomething about it. And so
has the faculty at the University
of Pittsburgh.

Presently, in CA5, as SGB Presi-

l dent Kent Baldauf explained, all

non-English—speaking T.A.s must
be enrolled in an English training
course to teach. At present, this
is done during the term they are
teaching.

However, for ‘the past two
years the School of Engineering
has required its foreign T.A.s to
complete the training and
demonstrate proficiency before
being allowed to actually teach a

class. A committee consisting of .

Baldauf, Harper Waters and three

. members of the Engineering Stu— ‘

do a self-breast examination ev-
ery month,” said Cherrie Rich,
coordinator of the centers.

The cards are free and come
with a more detailed breast-care
pamphlet with referral infor-
mation.

The showercard is only one of
the various teaching services
provided by the centers.

Patients at the centers receive

up a proposal to make this a re-
quirement in CA5.

Baldauf said that he specifical-
ly wants to propose this to the
math and physics departments,
which have the biggest problem.
He said that committee members
have seen vast improvements in
the quality of teaching of en-
gineering courses since this pro-
gram has been implemented.

”The main thing we want to do
is make it mandatory that the-T.A.
finish the course before entering
the classroom,” Baldauf said. He
feels the root of the problem is
that many people in graduate

schools are foreigners; ’,_’Ameri-" .
cans just. are _not- going tograd

20 to 30 minutes of breast care,
education during their visits, in-
cluding videotaped demonstra-
tions of how to perform a
self-breast examination and per-
sonal instruction by health profes-

' sionals.

”What makes us unique is our
strong educational component.
Our technicians are trained i-n ,
breast examination and teach‘

school.”

Under the present policy, all
T.A.s are evaluated in some way.
The office for the Evaluation of
Teaching administers surveys to
all undergraduate students. Al-
though statistics are not kept by
the office and all information kept
is confidential, the various
departments can use the informa-
tion the evaluation office
provides. A

”Each department uses the in-
formation differently,” Debbie
Hazlett from the office explained.
However, as data are collected, at
the "end of a semester, changes‘
often are not seen until thefol- _ _

Military tanker crashes in flames on Texas runway

ABILENE, Texas (AP) ‘ A mili-
tary tanker plane carrying 19 peo-
ple crashed in flames Tuesday
near a runway at Dyess Air Force
Base. Air Force officials said there
were bodies in the wreckage, but
wouldn't comment on casualties.

Reporters said they had not
seen any bodies removed from
the plane. The wreckage, scat-
tered over a wide area, continued
to burn more than an hour after
the crash.

A local justice of the peace was
called to the base to record fatal-
ities, his office said.

The KC—1 35A tanker crashed in
a ball of flame near the south end
of the Dyess runway, Air Force
officials said.

Vernon Wright, 19, said he was
on his way home when he saw
the crash.

The plane's crew ”never got it
off the ground,” he said.

”The first thing! saw was just
the mushroom of the smoke. 
I thought they were having a fire
drill,” he said.

’’I heard the plane as it was
coming down,” said Skeet Jack-
son. "Engines were backfiring
and missing. It curved off to the

 
  

\

 

left and crashed. And then I saw
the ball of smoke and fire go up.”

The plane, assigned to K.|. Saw-
yer Air Force Base in Michigan,
was en route from Dyess to Hick-
ham Air Force Base in Hawaii on

,a training mission, said Dyess Air-

man 1st Class Beverly Foster.

Domestic troubles told

By Adam W. Richter

Staff Writer

Janet Metz of the Women's
Center and Shelter of Greater
Pittsburgh informed an audience
of approximately 150 Pitt stu-
dents last night of the dangers of
dating violence, and what they
can do to curb it.

The two-hour presentation co-
vered topics such as why victims
continue relationships with phys-
ical abusers, characteristics of
these abusers, and what can be
done to reduce dating violence.

According to Metz, one of the
most important reasons victims of
abuse stay with their attackers is
that they expect this treatment,
either because of sexual stereo-
types or because the victims feel
that theirs are isolated cases of

assault. -

”They think that what's hap-
pening to them is only happen-
ing to them,” Metz said.

In many cases, Metz said,
women will stay out of fear of
what will happen to them if they
simply walk out on their abuser.

They will also stay if they feel‘

they could change their lover's

behavior, or because they love. 1

that person. _

The best solution to avoid dat-
ing or domestic violence, Metz
said, is to directly express emo-
tions such as frustration or sad-

ness at the time they are felt,‘

rather than to ’’stuff’' and repress
these feelings. Most importantly,
Metz wanted people to know that
everyone has the legal right to say
no.

Improvement needed

in medical

insurance

Health care here in the United States is without a doubt
one of the best in the world. Unfortunately, 37 million
Americans can't take advantage of this accomplishment
because they don't have health insurance.

The National Leadership Commission on Health Care,
a privately formed panel, said that the current $550 bil-
lion national health-care bill will triple to $1.5 trillion by

the year 2000.

The commission -advised a $500 million research pro-
gram to study the problem. It also recommended a plan
to provide the 37 million uninsured people with health
coverage through new taxes on employers who do not
provide health insurance to their employees and the em-

ployees themselves.

The idea of health care for everyone is sound in princi-

ple. It is the cost of health care, however, which is alienat-

ing a significant amount of the U.S. population. Extensive
investigation of the problem is a more logical approach,
before action such‘ as taxation can be taken to alleviate

medicine's high expense.

The commission's study of the health—care situation in
the United States will assist in determining possible strate-
gies to solve the problem. New taxes, however, is a rash 1
resolution to a complicated problem.

“It was only one paragraph. It
ran on Jan. 16, in my column

thing I want from him is for him
to end the situation.”

column, in the context of moral
judgement about suicide, but that
was an attempt to deal with the
issue of suicide and the afterlife.
The response to that particular ex-
ample was negligible, but the vast
majority of those writing to The
Pitt News wanted to talk about

OK, let's talk about God.

There are many things that man
(of course this include women,
which should go without saying)
do to reassure themselves about
whatever‘ they need to be reas-
sured about.

Life is full of questions. We
wonder about where we came
from, what we should and should
not do. Why is the sky blue?
What happens when we die?

Now we know that the sky is
blue because of water vapor. So
what? Big deal? We still don't
know what happens when we
die. Sure, everyone has an opin-
ion, but no one can prove a damn
thing.

overturning the 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision, the U.S. Surgeon
General, C. Everett Koop, who is
also a ’’self-proclaimed right-to-

those lines — a primitive shrine._

Later, man came up with the
concept of a god for every occa-
sion. Starting with the Egyptians,
there developed a parade of pan-
theons: the god of the sun, of the
moon, of the woods, of cities, of
love, of death and so on ad
nauseam. The Romans even had
a god for doorways. ,

Then, and I assume most of my
readers follow this guy, came Ya-

Monotheism (sort of, if you don't
involve the trinity).

Let us pause for a moment of
respectful silence — OK, that's
enough. Now, what's wrong with
this picture? If you said it was that
so many people have so many
different ideas about something
supposedly universal, then you
win a St. Christopher medal for
your dashboard.

I'm not saying that there isn't a
god. I'm really not. What I am

saying is, what do we'know'

about him?

All we have to go on is blind
faith. And every religion falls
back on faith. Of course, they say

Considering that the U.S. has
the highest teen pregnancy and
abortion rate in the industrialized
world, the right-to-life movement
must provide alternative methods
(i.e.; making sex education as

' mandatory as reading and writ-

ing) before reversing a decision as
crucial as Roe vs. Wade. .

We feel the lack‘ of depth and
thought in Mr. Oliverio’s article
is representative of the whole rigt—
to—life movement's inability to ac-
cept the harsh realities we all
must face. If Roe vs. Wade is re-
voked our society will suffer dras-

WILLIAM
YOUNG .

Throughout the month of

February, I will be writing on the
ills ofAmerica. If you happen to
be an advocate of the homeless,
Social Security, welfare and pub-
lic schools, just to name a few,
you'll want to tune in. Natural-
ly, letters from enraged students
are encouraged, so get your pens

and paper ready. Today's install-
ment: the homeless.

Once upon a time, people who
lived in boxcars were called ho-
bos and people who slept on
park benches were bums. Now
the psuedo-intellectuals have
consecrated them as ”the
homeless.”

Undoubtedly, there are those
few tragic cases of people who
really did not have any alterna-
tive but to move into the streets,‘
but even this is suspect. Think
logically for just a second: Just
how the devil do people really
end up having to live on-the
street?

First, let's talk about teenagers.
Lots of kids from abused families

‘head to the big cities every year
- (i.e. running away) in search ofa

better life. Very ‘rarely do they
ever find it. Rather, they end up
addicted to drugs, living in an
abandoned buildings and turning

° The Search For Realityl Just who are th

to prostitution. But are the streets
the only place they could have
turned to?

And what about the rest? The
downtrodden Vietnam veteran
who feels he got a raw deal and
didn't feel like coping with real
life when he got back, so he
never did anything except
wander around. You can come
up with endless scenarios and an
even wider variety of people if
you try, but what about the essen-
tial question here? Just how do
they get on the streets?

Well, naturallyfthey choose to
be there. Catch your breath and
consider this: What human being
does not know at least one other
human being? With this in mind,
it seems pretty easy to jump to the
conclusion that if someone were
in danger of being forced into the
streets, that they could call on the
help of another person. What per-
son would prefer to see a friend

or relative move out. onto the
streets instead of helping him out
in his time of need? Even if you
could find a person with a justifi-
able reason, there is always
another friend or relative (or
friend of a friend).

I know what you're thinking:
That's_unreasonable; how can he
(me, that is) think people are just
going to help someone out like
that? Golly, if a friend or a rela-
tive won't help, there are always
organizations associated with
churches and such that could
help. God, I'm told, helps out the

less fortunate in their time of

need.

So, what am I getting at, you're
probably wondering? Simple. If
you stop helping out the home-
less people, they won't be home-
less anymore. Sure, it sounds
pretty insensitive to tell groups
like the Student Action Union
that they would do more good by

Psychologist Judith S. Waller-

This all sounds lovely, doesn't
it? A trip ending with an all-out,

that's what I thought when we

and in a 10-year follow-up study
occurring in 1980 and 1981, she
found "41 percent [of those chil-

underachieving, self-deprecating
and sometimes angry young_men
and women. The rest were strik-_
ingly uneven in how they adjust-
ed to the world; it is too soon to
say how they will turn out.”

Wallerstein writes that the find-
ings were shockingly contrary to
her expectations.

Not only were the children of
divorce emotionally and psycho-
logically battered; the parents, for
whom divorce was once adver-
tised as a cure-all- for conflict,
suffered in a wayrthat produced
further negative effects on their
offspring: "We found that fully a

that my descent was into Hell...

When we landed in Chicago,
the weather was clear and brutal-
ly cold. The passengers rushed off
the plane to talk to the airline
representative about our connec-
tions, and I soonfound out that
my flight was delayedfor two

hours. I sort of expected that to _

happen because it was the Christ-

He sat down and proceeded to

"Children longed for their
fathers,” writes Wallerstein, "and

the need increased during adoles- .

cence." Feelings of physicaland
emotional abandonment, an ina-
bility by many of the children of
divorce to set goals for their lives
and limited educations were
other -conditions discovered in
Wa|lerstein's study.

Were it an earthquake, the so-
cial impact of divorce would rate
a "10" on the Richter scale. The
decline in math and science
scores, the illiteracy. problem,
homelessness and greatly dimin-
ished income for women can all
be linked to the higher divorce;
rate. ;

In 1962, at the beginning of the

social revolution, there were only 4

cording to the National Center for

number had more than doubled,

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. —
High—scoring Florida State
point guard George McCloud
enjoyed a spectacular January,
leading the eighth-ranked
Seminoles to a 8-0 month and
a return to college basketball’s
top 10. -

McCloud, a 6-foot—7, 205-
pound senior, averaged 26
points per game in that time,
hitting 50 percent of his 66 at-
tempts from 3-point distance
and 58 of 68 free throws.

Florida State slipped into the
top 10 during Christmas week
for the first time since 1972,
when the school made its lone
Final Four appearance, but a
one-point loss to Villanova
knocked the Seminoles back
to 14th.

The 68-67 loss, along with
the loss of two of the team's
top six players, left coach Pat
Kennedy with a mission.

”You’re going to stumble

Kennedy. ”We stumbled at

points in January. .

NEW, YORK (AP) — Many will
be household names. Some may
even be legends. On Wednes-
day, many of the NFL’s biggest
stars could become free agents
when the league puts into effect
its new contract plan.

A radical departure from the
old free agency system, it is be-

I ing imposed unilaterally without

a union contract and will uncon-

.ditionally_ free more than 600 -

players. Each team will be al-
lowed to protect just 37 of the
average of 59 on its roster.

”You’ll see Super Bowl players, -

Pro Bowl players, very big
names,” said Tex Schramm,

president of the DallasiCowboys_ _

and a member of the owners’
Management Council.

”But there will be reasons for
them — they'll be bad medical
risks," they'll be older. A lot of
them will be getting good salar-
ies, own homes in the. area,
things like that. They won't want
to move.”

Under the old plan, players
offered a contract by another
team could move only after their
team waived ‘its right_ of first
refusal. The new team would also
have to compensate the oldone
with draft choices.

Only two players in 10 years
moved under that system, most
recently, linebacker Wilber Mar-
shall of Chicago, who signed a $6
million, five-year contract last
year with Washington. He joined
the Redskins after‘ the Bears
declined to match the offer and
Chicago got two first-round draft

,. 4 picks inreturn.

Parts of that system remain in
effect — protected players whose
contracts have expired still would
be subject to first refusal, and
teams signing them would have
to part with draft choices. The
rest, under contract or not, will be
free until April 1 to go elsewhere
without compensation.

Although few teams have iden-
tified unprotected players, the
consensus is that most will pro-
tect younger players with poten-
tial while leaving older, more
established players unprotected.
The older ones have less incen-
tive to move; high salaries or in-
jury problems that. make them
unattractive to prospective
bidders. ‘ .

The Chicago-Bears, for exam-

Sixers look to rebuild

By RALPH BERNSTEIN

AP Sports Writer

PHILADELPHIA —— The
Philadelphia 76ers are not even
close to the dominating teams
once spearheaded by Julius Erv-
ing, but general manager John
Nash is convinced that one of the
league's prize franchises is head-
ed in the right direction.

Last year, after half the season,
the 76ers were second to the
Boston Celtics in the NBA’s At-
lantic Conference, but 10 games
out and fading at 19-21.

They entered Tuesday night's
game at Cleveland 24-18, 2
games behind the leading New
York Knicks, and despite a crush
of injuries are showing signs of a
team with a future instead ofjust
a past.

Nash conceded the Sixers fall
shy of matching the talent of the

Los Angeles Lakers, Detroit
Pistons, Cavaliers and others. But
now, instead of rebuilding a
whole team, he is faced with fill-
ing a hole or two.

Nash would like to get in a
trade or via the draft a big man
in the mold of Utah's Mark Eaton,
Golden State's Manute Bol, the
Knicks’ Patrick Ewing, or
Houston's Akeem Olajuwon.

Nash does not discount the
blocked—shot contributions of
center Mike Gminski.

He cites Gminski’s play as one
reason for the team's improve-
ment over last year.

”Mike Gminski has stabilized
our center position. For the first
time in years (since the trade of
Moses Malone), we have a center
who gives us a solid game night
in and night out. He's averaged
16 points and 10 rebounds. He

doesn't turn the ball over. He

DePaul blasts Dukes

Stanley Brundy scored 18

Gminski had 65 blocks enter-

Robert Parish (56) at Boston, Brad

over the 76ers’ center.

’’I’d like to draft a 6—(foot—)9 guy

and can play tough defense,”

Maurice Cheeks is aging and
seemingly more prone to injury,
Nash would like to draft a point

Although Nash likes 5-I1 Scott
Brooks from Cal—lrvine, who has

done a good job in relief of
Cheeks, he sees Brooks strictly as
a backup player.

”Brooks is very effective pass-
ing ahead on the break, and he
can knock down the 3-point shot.
That's helps our postup players
such as Charles Barkley. He gets
the ball to Ron Anderson. Ander-
son enjoys being on the court
with Brooks. He's a breath of
fresh air for our second unit.”

Anderson has been a surprise
this season. He averaged nine
minutes a game and 7.3 points
per game last year for Indiana,
which dealt him to the Sixers for
rookie Everette Stephens. Ander-
son has been a revelation as a
perimeter shooter, averaging 17
points. He has teamed with
rookie Hersey Hawkins to give
Philadelphia the outside shooting
it lacked last season.

Coach Jim Lynam feels his

team can score with anybody but
is concerned with the Sixers’ in-
consistent defensive effort. He
feels that when the 76ers play
tough defense, they can handle
any team in the NBA.

’ Right now, the team is loaded

with injuries.

Bark|ey’s severely sprained
right ankle is in a cast to keep it
immobile, and he is not expect-
ed to be available until Friday.

Cheeks, out with a separated
right shoulder, may be back Fri-
day. David Wingate is day-to-day
with a knee problem. Cliff Robin-
son is gone for at least another
month, rehabilitating after sur-
gery on a splintered left kneecap.

Lynam started three rookies -
Hawkins, Brooks and Shelton
Jones — in Saturday's win over

Pens drop 5-1 game
to Habs at the Igloo

(AP) — Mats Naslund and
Mike Keane each scored twice
and goalie Patrick Roy
stopped 38 shots to help the
Montreal Canadiens beat the
Pittsburgh Penguins 5-1 Tues-
day night.

Keane opened the scoring
for Montreal at 5:19 of the first
period. His shot from the slot

I went in off goalie Frank

Pietrangelo.

Bob Errey gave Pittsburgh a
tie at 9:35 when he banged in
Paul Coffey’s centering pass
for his 18th.

Montreal went ahead 2-1 at
18:36. Bobby Smith, un-
checked near the net, flipped
in the rebound of Larry Robin-
son's shot from the left point
for his 22nd. Smith had been
held without a point in his
previous four games.

Naslund had the only goal
of the second period. Smith, in

too deep to shoot the puck,
circled behind the net and
centered to Naslund, who
knocked in the pass for his
22nd.

Naslund beat Pietrangelo
from 10 feet on a power play
at 14:20 of the third period af-
ter a pass from Smith. Keane
scored off Guy Carbonneau’s
feed with 32 seconds left for
his 10th. »

Roy, who is 15-0-2 at home
this season, raised his road
record to 6-5-1. He has won
eight of his last 10 decisions
overall.

The Canadiens ended a two-
game road losing streak. Mon-

' treal is 8-3-0 in its last 11 road

games.

Pittsburgh had won three
straight. Penguins center
Mario Lemieux was held
without a point for only the se-
cond time in the last 27
games.

AP Football Writer

NEW YORK (AP) ~ The NFL
Players Association received dues
from only about a fourth of its
members in the year it struck the
league for 24 days, but union offi-
cials said Tuesday that a majori-
ty of the nearly 1,600 players
have now paid up.

According to the union's finan-
cial statement for the period from
March 1, 1987 to Feb. 29, 1988,
filed with the Labor Department
Jan. 23, the organization received
$877,441 in dues compared to
$3.7 million for the 1986-87

Dues for the earlier period
were $2,400 per player com-
pared to $2,000 in the later
report. Still, even at the lower
figure, that comes out to just 438
players who paid up.

But Gene Upshaw, the union's
executive director, said Tuesday
that the period covered was one
in which there was no automatic
dues checkoff — by which the
teams automatically pay dues to
the union from the player's
paychecks. As a result, players
had to make direct payments to
the union.

”We didn't even start collect-
ing dues until December," said

$164,847 during the period
represents a 4 percent increase
over the previous year's. ”The
period in the report ends March
1 and we kept on collecting dues.
We have a majority of players
paying now.” A

A The report came a month after
two reports that the Labor Depart-
ment had passed along informa-
tion from its audit of the NFLPA
to the Justice Department for pos-
sible action. Neither agency has
commented on the allegations
and Upshaw and his assistant,
Doug Allen, said two weeks ago
at a news conference that what

to Upshaw in the reports was no
more than deferred payment.

There was no mention of that
payment in the financial
statement. '

Upshaw is by far the highest
paid employee of the union,
receiving a total of $182,156 in
salary and expenses. Allen
received $89,136 of which
$67,350 was salary, and Frank
Woschitz, the public relations

director, received $57,760 in sa- ’

lary and $22,096 in expenses.

Dick Berthelsen, the union's
general counsel, is not listed on

‘ ~ ~J.‘».- .5» ' '

Past due NFLPA money finally rolling in

professional expenses, which to-
tal $494,139. ~

This financial report was due
last May 29 and was filed eight
months late, not atypical for the
NFLPA, which in the past has
filed its reports even later.

It shows that the union, which

dismissed 17 of its 36 employees
during the period-, had a net loss

of $310,000, which Upshaw said »

is largely on paper because it was
forced to list future severance

SANDY SPRING, Md. (AP)

’ — Richie Anderson, who

rushed for 3,579 yards and 42
touchdowns in his final two
years of high school, said
Tuesday he plans to attend
Penn State University on a
football scholarship.
Anderson, a member of the
USA Today and Parade Maga-
zine All-American teams, was

leges and universities nation-

recruited by hundreds of col-'

wide. The Sherwood High
School senior finally made his
decision after taking official
visits to Syracuse, Maryland,
Ohio State and Penn State.
’’I feel this will provide me
with a chance for a solid edu-
cation as well as a good foot-
ball career,” said the 6-foot-2,
2lO—pound halfback. ”Penn
State has always been known
for having student athletes,
and that's important to me.

Penn State gets commitment ,
from All-American running back  

, Also, I'm obviously looking

forward to playing for Coach
Uoe] Paterno.” .

As a senior, Anderson aver-
aged 206 yards per contest
and 818 yards per carry. He
scored 22 TDs and five two-
point conversions.

THE PITT NEWS, SPRING BREAK '89, Wednesday, February l, 1989

It's money that matters
Students shop around for the perfect Spring Break spots

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief
If Pitt students want to have fun
during this year's Spring Break,
they just may have to pay
hundreds of dollars for it.
Students will be celebrating
Pitt's second annual Spring Break
from March 5 to March 12 and
the three most popular vacation

spots will be Daytona, Florida;
Cancun, Mexico; and Freeport,
Bahamas.

”[Students] want the beach and
they want to know where every-
one ‘else is going,” said JoAnn
Cosentino, travel consultant for
University Travel, located on
Forbes Ave.. ’’I can't get anybody
to go to the gulf side of Florida,

like Tampa. When you say Tam-
pa to them, they think that's old.”

Cosentino said that Daytona
and Fort Lauderdale, FL are the

biggest attractions for students.»

The University Travel’s vacation
package for a one week trip to
Daytona includes air fare, a dou-
ble room at the Clarendon Plaza,
located on the strip and an Avis

sub-compact rental car, all priced
at $507 per person.

University Travel trips to Can-
cun range from ‘$495 to approxi-
mately $1000. Among those
prices, Cosentino recommends
the $595 package which includes
air fare and hotel costs for one
week at the Villas Plaza, located
on the beach. -

’’I wouldn't advise anyone rent-
ing a car in Mexico,” said Cosen-
tino. ”You really’don’t need on
down there.” '

A trip to Freeport sponsored by
University Travel, is priced be-
tween $5OO and $600 dollars, in-
cluding air fare and a one week
stay at the beachfront Holiday
Inn. ‘

According to Cosentino, stu-
dent sales to all three destinations
have increased dramatically from
that of last year's Spring Break.

Also competing for students’
vacation money is The Pitt Pro-
gram Council which is sponsor-
ing a Spring Break trip to
Daytona. The package, priced at
$207 per person, includes a room
for four at the Clarendon Plaza,
bus transportation to Daytona
and a free visit to Endless Sum-
mer Tanning Salon.

”Our trip is geared to afforda-
bility,” said Tom Misuraca, advi-

”lt’s a more relaxing trip,” said
Kristy Smith, PPC travel chairper-
son. ”Students want no worries.
They want to put their money
down and just go.”

Misuraca said he believes Day-
tona has overtaken Fort Lauder-
dale as the primary Spring Break
vacation spot. He expects regis-
tration of the PPC trip to increase
over that of last year.

”We’re providing students with
the best of what can be provided
for,” said Smith.

In addition to Daytona, trips to
Cancun are being offered by var-
Ious sponsors. -

”Cancun has just as‘[ma_ny] par-
ties [as Daytona] if not more,”
said Paula Seleyo, Pitt graduate
and representative of College
Tours. ”lt’s like one big party
down there.”

According to Seleyo, College
Tours is sponsoring a $429 trip to
Cancun for eight days and seven
nights. The package includes air
fare, leaving from Cincinnati, and
a room for four atthe Parador

THE PITT NEWS, SPRING BREAK '89, Wednesday, February 1, 1989

New attitudes

 

FT. LAUDERDALE

By Michele Quinn

The Pitt News

Fort . Lauderdale no longer
wants to be a spring—break haven
for college students seeking beer
chugging contests and women in
wet T—shirts, said District Com-
mander James Mowell of the Fort
Lauderdale Police Department.

The city, more than just strings

bof bars and T-shirt shops, wants

to attract other than just college
students and create a world-class
family resort.

”Students see movies in which
people come down here and

meet lots of girls, drink lots of’

beer and then throw up on the
sidewalk. We want to change that
image,” Mowell said.

People go to Fort Lauderdale

gxpecting to find the city they see
in the movies, Mowell said.

”College students come here
on Spring Break because they feel
it will be five weeks of non-stop
partying,” Mowell said.

Last year, between Feb. 26 and
April 4, 6.7 percent of the arrests
in Fort Lauderdale involved
students. ._

Most of the arrests were‘mis—

qemeanors such as urinating in
the ocean, sleeping on the beach
or public indecency, Mowell
said.

”We aren't running a police
state. We can't arrest everyone
who spits on the sidewalk or jay-
walks,” Mowell said. ”The arrests
we make we feel are necessary to
keep some semblancevof order.

”How wouldstudents like it if
they looked out their [windows]
in their [neighborhoods] and saw

dollars for beach redevelopment.

”We are in the process of
redeveloping 33 acres of the
beach which includes the strip
where most college students go
during Spring Break,” Mowell
said. '

Already, some ”hotspots,”
such as Penrods, a’ popular place
for college students, have closed
due to the decreasing college-
break crowds.

”Many businesses are realizing
they cannot survive on just the
businessduring Spring Break,”
Mowell said. ”We would like to
make it a place for year—round
businesses.”

Part of the redevelopment
money will be used in building
a discovery center and also a per-
-forming arts center, Mowell said.

Ultimately, the residents of Fort
Lauderdale want their city to be
chosen as the “No. 1 city in the
United States” in the population
category in 1994.

Mowell stressed that Fort
Lauderdale still wants students to
visit but only if they are willing
to abide by the rules.

DAYTO NA

By Michele Quinn
The Pitt News

Daytona Beach, Fla., is de-
veloping into a Spring Break‘cap—
ital for college students, said
Georgia Carter, publicity
manager for the Destination Day-
tona program of the Convention

° Resorts debate: family vacation spot vs collegiate

and Visitors Bureau.

Between 350,000 and 400,000
people are expected to visit Day-
tona Beach, 100,000 more than
last year, Carter said.

”Wejust spent $40,000 in ad-
vertising to promote Daytona
Beach and bring more college
students down here,” Carter said.

Destination Daytona wants to
create a place for college students
to visit and do more than drink.

' ”We want to provide good,
clean fun. We feel there is a lot
more to do in Daytona than just
drink,” Carter said. ”The contests
are still out there, but we are try-
ing to make them lower-key and
develop more sports-related
contests.”

Carter explained that most
hotels now offer ”welcome par-

playground  

ties,” ”farewe|| parties,” and
some offer volleyball tour-
naments.

Expositions and concerts are
also scheduled so visitors feel

they have more choices than the ‘

beach and the bars. g
Many hotels are being built or
remodeled to keep up with the

surge of tourists. Some hotels spe- ‘

cifically cater to college students 0
by offering budget rates.

”We feel that college student
vacations are a big piece of busi-
ness,” Carter said.

By focusing on the hotel ac-
commodations, the weather and
the many activities available,
Carter feels Daytona Beach will
attract many more students in the
future.

Last_ year this student belly-flopped himself onto the pages of The Pitt News.’ Wonder if he ever recuperated?

Oakland?

During Spring Break, many

university will be open, including
the dormitories, so there is no
need to make other housing ar-
rangements.

terfest is a week—long festival
which offers events such as
downhill racing, backwards ski-
ing competitions and volleyball

Levy, director of ski-area market-

, ing at the resort.

F Winterfest is also an annual
event which ”usually draws a big
crowd and offers good skiing,”

‘said Levy. -

The climax of Winterfest will
take place on Saturday, March 4.
The day will feature a rock ’n’ roll
revival for those 21 and older, a
tug—of-war on the slopes, a torch-
light paradedown the mountain
after dark and a ski rally. The ral-
ly is a race during which par-
ticipants ski to checkpoints on the
slopes, competing to establish the
best time. Prizes are awarded for
the best time.

Lift tickets will cost $28 on the
weekends and $19 on weekdays
during Winterfest. Afterglvlarch 5,
however, rates will drop to $9.50

Dollars and sense?
More roommates mean less money

By Brendan Kevenides
Senior Staff Writer

Bending the rules in Daytona
can not only save money but add
to the fun.

Pitt students Erich Burget, Mike
Warchol and 12 of their friends
will share two hotel rooms,
squeezing seven people into
each, to save on lodging costs
during Spring Break.‘ This is
despite a common hotel/motel
policy in Daytona which only
permits four people to each
room.

Last year, Burget and Warchol
were part of a 10—person group
which piled into one room.

Was 10' people in one room
uncomfortable? ”For me per-
sonally, no. Some people would
rather spend the extra money to
sleep in a bed every night, but I'd
rather spend my money on other
things,” said Burget.

According to Warchol, in ord-
er to sleep on one of the matress-
es in the room, he had to get
home early.

According to Burget, it is easy
to slip past desk clerks due to the
intense volume of people coming
and going. He added that the
hotel in which they will be stay-
ing this year has many side en-
trances which will allow his
friends to slip in and out in

smaller groups.

”There will be so many people
in the hotel when we arrive, I
don't think they will be nit-
picking anyone,” said Burget.

Warchol said that last year, the
group did not ask for maid serv-
ice so that no one would catch on

that there were 10 people in the .

room. Because of this, the room
became quite a mess.
Promiscuous behavior required

If you do walk in
on somebody, A that
would probably
make the trip more
interesting.

one to be home early, said

‘ Burget.

”You just had to get there and
start working early,” said Burget.
”Besides, even if someone walks
in, nobody’s going to get too em-
barrassed. If you do walk in on
somebody, that would probably
make the trip more interesting.”

How often were all 10 people
in the room at once? ”Not too
often,” said Warchol.

He said that they were all
together at night, when they were

taking showers and in the early
morning when they were asleep.

”We showered, drank, slept,
‘then left,” said Burget.

He added that the room was
sometimes. very crowded be-
tween 7 and 9 p.m., when they
were all in the room drinking.

Burget added that, for_ the most
part, the group went out to bars
to drink, although that tended to
be a problem because many in
the group were not 21. He said
that once in while they invited
people to the room to drink.

Warchol said that they were
very careful not to break
anything. .

”As a matter of fact, we got our
entire $80 damage deposit
back," he said.

Last year, the group drove to
Daytona on their own. Warchol
said that gas cost each person
about $30 apiece and lodging ran
about $40 each for an entire

week. He explained that if he had I
wanted to live comfortably, four ’

people to a room, it would have
cost them about $130 apiece.

Burget said that gas and lodg-

: ing will run him about.$80_this

Warchol said that this year the 1
living quarters should be more J

Spring Break, for some stu-
dents, seerns to be synony-
mous with sun, surf — and
sex.

For students lying on the
beaches, wearing hardly any
clothes and consuming large
quantities of alcohol, Spring
Break could turn into a week
of ”one-night stands.”

A week full of wild antics,
including wet T-shirt contests
and sleeping on the beach,
could easily invite some peo-
ple to relax and ”have a good
time.”

However, for some people
who are thrown into this at-
mosphere without realizing
what could happen, this can
be a very difficult time.

Though there doesn't seem
to be any specific research on
the psychological effects of a

._ one-night stand, Dr. Silvija

Singh, a psychologist at the
University of Pittsburgh Coun-
seling Services, feels that the
impulsiveness involved in

one-night stands is one way of

dealing with desires and sex-
uality..

According to Rita Drapkin,
a counselor at the center, sex-
uality, in a broad sense, is peo-
ple seeing themselves as
sexual beings.

”Sexuality is part of our or-
ganism, just like intelligence.
lt-is a part of how we relate to
other people," Drapkin con-
ﬂnued.

’’I think that what people
end up doing is feeling guilty
about their sexuality. Sex is-
sues aren't dealt with openly
in our society,” Singh said.

The AIDS scare has made
more people aware of sex;

however, ”sexuality” is a

different issue.
Many ideas about sexuality

years. Some women are told
to be ”serious” about sex,
while men are given the im-
pression that sex is a way for
them to ”sow their wild oats.”

People deal with their sexu-
ality in_ many different ways,

i have been taught over the‘ —

selves in monogamous rela-
tionships.

However, Singh feels that
some people do not deal with
their sexuality every day and
instead relegate’it into one
wild week. '

”This wild week seems to
be something that is done
’down there’ and not up here.
In this way, people can dis-
miss their behavior by saying
‘I wasn't myself. I was under
the influence of alcohol,’ ”
Singh explained. S

’’It seems as if there is a
group phenomenon going on
during Spring Break. There is
a certain group pressure to
participate,” Singh said. ’’If a
person doesn't do anything,

g he or she could be afraid of
seeming inadequate.”

Singh feels that a wide range
of behavior should be accept-
ed in order to make everyone
feel comfortable with his or
her own sexuality.

A cost-effective alternative to Spring Break

Some students are going away,
to Fort Lauderdale, to Daytona
Beach, to the four corners of the
earth for a Spring Break in the
sun. .

And then, some students aren't.

So, here are some thoughts for
the penny-pinching Pitt student
who still wants to have fun.

Sleeping

0 Sleep. Sleep long, sleep hard.
Sleep ’til you can't sleep no
more.

0 In between sleeping sessions,
imagine that you're vacationing
in Cancun.

Demanding some fun

For those who prefer some-
thing a little more active, or
perhaps a little more real:

°Make tomato soup from
ketchup and hot water. After dis-
covering how good it tastes, go
to the ”O” and demand that they
serve you some. When they
profess ignorance and amaze-
ment, demand to see the
manager. This should kill most of
the afternoon, without costing
you a cent.

0 Go to LeMont and demand
the same thing, only say it in
French. If they actually produce
some tomato soup (in French),
pretend to go to the bathroom,

demand steamed towels, then .

storm out without paying before
they get a chance to steam any.

0 Go to the zoo, and demand
that they set the animals free.

0 Find out who ”they” are. De-
mand to know whether ”they”
who work at the ”O” are the
same as ”they” of the LeMont
and ”they” at the zoo.

Visiting

Whenever possible, ask the
lucky recipient of your visit to pay
for the privilege; bus fare, plane
tickets, whatever: A

0 Visit mom.

°Visit dad, if he isn't with
mom.

0 Visit grandma, grandpa, un-
cles, aunts, and sundry relatives.
0 Visit the site of old Fort Du-

I quesne, which is, namely, a very

interesting wall. Feel ‘self-
righteous about the sanctity of

condoms). Think about some of
these:

0 Flip through old issues of
