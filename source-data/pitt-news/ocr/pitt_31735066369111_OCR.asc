Withlthe passage of the .Middle‘ '

.‘ lncome''S'tudent Assistance Act, the
r ‘federal government has opened the

doors for more than twice .as_ many
Pitt students to receive ﬁnancial
aid as are presently _‘ receiving.
assistance, according to ,'Frank

. Dutkovich, director of the ofﬁce of

Student Aid. . _
The new legislation is two-fold,

calling for changes in two federally

funded loan programs. The ﬁrst of

.these programs is "the govern-

me_nt’s guaranteed,loan plan,
which offers interest-free loans to
undergraduate students.. Prior to
the "passage ‘of the Student
Assistance Act an income ceiling
of $13,000 existed, but with the
recent changes any undergraduate —
Student can receive a guaranteed
loan of upto $7,500. ‘

C223 Students whose families learn

1655 than $25,000 a year are eligible

~ for Basic Grant awards ranging

from $176 to $1,600. Presently,

approximately 4,000 Pitt students _

are receiving the Basic Grants. _
’ Dutkovich said that the question
now is howmuch the government

’ will expand the program‘ into the’

higher income brackets. He said

‘that the appropriationsthis ﬁrst
‘year ‘may not be great .eno'ngh to’
extend the loan program ,’ ex-.

tensively into the $25,000 range.
Dutkovich said the whatever the
increase it will certainly be above

, the present $13,000 cut-offvpoint.

The state loan. program also

received a boost- when the"
Pennsylvania Higher , Education ,

Assistance Agency was allocated

more than $6 million bythe federal .

government for the expansion of
the existing student loan program

A to include more guaranteed loans

for the coming year. A

This shows‘ $2.1— million
increase over the 1977 allocation
for the same purpose of the more

than 101,000'loans worth over $185 -

million. _ .

At the present time there are

10,000 students receiving -various .

forms of ﬁnancial aid from the state
and federal government, a ﬁgure
which constitutes more than half of
all undergraduates at Pitt.
Dutkovich encourages all stud-
ents to ﬁle the necessary financial

lsiature, said Iastlnight that he expected appropriations "tor: Pitt to-

Assistance Act Dolubleslvumbfer dist

aid forms regardless’ of whether

they have been turned down for

assistance in the-past. ' _ , , p
“Conditions can_ change from
year to year, but students‘ ‘hesitate

I

‘ to take the time to ﬁll out the forms
‘ from year to ' year because they

were turned down before for
ﬁnancial aid,” Dutkovich said.
‘_‘There, are no two families who
w_ould_be considered for financial
aid in the same way so just because
at students’ neighbor or relative
isn't eligible for aid doesn’t mean
that they aren’t eligible.”

Dutkovich said that the Ofﬁce of
Student Aid is making an all-out

- effort to distribute ﬁnancial — aid
information to ._ the students this

year. Financial aid applications for

next year will be available Dec. 4
on the ground floor, of the I
' Cathedral of Learning and on the

main ﬂoor of the Student Union.

I _Dutkovich urges’ students not

to mail these’ applications until

-after Jan.vl,- 1979 because of the

federal ruling requiring that a total
years income must be stated on
these financial aid, forms before
they will be considered.

State representatives visiting the
University last night for a
reception and dinner hosted by

Chancellor Posvar expressed opin- ‘

ions varying from pessimistic to
slightly hopeful_on the status of
funds for Pitt and other state-relat-
ed universities. _

Rick Chess, a Democratic state"

_- representative-elect’ from the Mt.

Washington-West ‘ End area of
Pittsburgh said the -outlook for
. appropriations for higher education
is “very, very, very‘, "very bad.’,’ ’

“Everybody will be; tightening .
. their belt and any hope formore

f_unds- for universities without an
increase in accountability is just. a
pipe dream,” Chess said during an
interview before. the dinner.‘

._ _ Chess, who was director of
consumer affairs in Allegheny
County, said that the ﬁndings of
the Trille fCoinmittee‘, which
investigated ﬁnances at the state-

being questioned by state legislat-
ors because the committee had
problems getting enough funds to
do its job adequately.

The Trille Committee found that A

there were no serious problems

.with the spending procedures at
Pitt, Penn State, Temple and,‘

Lincoln Universities.

Chess said that the main‘
question that will face the
Pennsylvania legislature this win-
ter is_ the possibility of a tax
increase. A . i - _

“Every ‘indication is that if. we
continue funding at the currentrate.
and especially if. we-are talking of

doing things to help repair our.-=—

bridges and roads, we are talking-
about a tax increase,” Chess said.

He added that the only tax increase _

he could foresee would be in the

gasoline tax, which would go 
directly toward appropriations for 0 .

the state highway program.

The Pitt Student Govern-
ment'Board has approved the
A appointment of Craig Yankes p
as chairman of a special task
"force designed to investigate
the functions and future of Pitt
Union ‘Program council. The
approval was unamious at
SGB’s Wednesday meeting.
Yankes will run the task
' force which will consist of ﬁve
members of the Assembly
Council, two SGB board mem-
bers, the 'two advisors and
the general "chairman of the
program council.
The task force will have the
resp_onsibi1ity _of determining

the relations between the
council and other student

0 organizations and the student
body at large. It will also
investigate the council’s inter- A
nal structure and its future at
the University.

The SGB deleted one of the
original purposes of the task '
force proposed by Yankes. The
proposal written by Yankes
suggested that the task force
also investigate whether the
contract between the SGB and
the Ofﬁce of Student Activities
that set up the program council
was legal.

SGB member‘ Diane Behrers
said that the board decided not
to assign the task force that

SGB Approves Program Council Task Force _

— duty because it. was ridiculous
A to have a task force of the board
decide whether a, contract
agreed to 4 by the SGB was

3 legal.

A tul1'report»of its ﬁndings
will be due Feb. 14; 1979. The
first meeting will be sometime
‘next week; a speciﬁc date has
not been set. All meetings will
be open to the public.

A resolution was approved at
Wednesday’s meeting, to ap-
point a student journalist to
cover all SGB meetings. The
report will appear as a paid

, advertisment in the Student

Government Corner. It will not
be an attempt by the SGB to
editorialize, according to one

board member, but rather’ a.
synopsis of the meeting min-
utes, .

Behrers, one of the_ sup-
porters of this motion, said that
this step was necessary to
make sure that students were
aware ofall the actions taken

,by the SGB. She said that
stories in The Pitt News often
cover only .a few of the actions
of the board_at meetings.

She. said that the. report in
the Student Government
Corner would" include the
smaller items not usually
covered, such as announce-
ments about appointments to
committees. « 0 l

Legislators Voice Views on Future Money for Pih‘

Representative K. Leroy Irvis,
who may be ousted as speaker of
the House if the Republicans
maintain the majority they hold in
the legislature, said that he
believed the appropriations for Pitt
and other universities should stay
equal with or comparative to
appropriations in past years.

"I don't foresee us (Pitt) in any
more severe trouble than other
years,” said Irvis. He pointed out
that with Richard Thornburgh as
governor and other Western
Pennsylvanians in key positions in
the state House and state Senate,
Pitt should receive much attention
when it comes time to consider
funding for Pitt. —

Irvis also said that the attitude

among his constituents and among
people throughout Pennsylvania is
friendly to higher education. “In

general, my impression is that
most people are pleased to support
higher education but they don't
understand the inﬂationary cost of
it,” he said.

Representative-elect Terrance
McVerry, (Rep. - Mt. Lebanon)
said that higher education and
education in general has been and
must be a priority of state
government. He said that it would
not be realistic to think of cutting
expenditures for universities like
Pitt because they provide education
for so many Pennsylvanians.

McVerry added that he would
have to study funding for Pitt and

statements on the subject.

“Just being a newly elected
representative, I do not know
enough about the inroads of
ﬁnancing to say, ‘Yes, we can cut,’

_or ‘Yes, we can increase funds,’
(for higher education),” McVerry’

said.

Both Irvis and McVerry said the
question the legislature must
answer when it convenes in

. January is the budget problem and
‘the need to solve the financial

problems of the state.

McVerry said that represent-
atives must face the fact that. in
January, 1980, the personal income
tax and corporate income tax in
Pennsylvania will drop by .2

per cent. Both these taxes were
raised temporarily’ as a stop gap
measure to increase Pennsyl-
vania’s revenues.

Irvis said that the state welfare
system is going to need money
almost immediately after V repre-
sentatives are sworn in this
January. However, Irvis said he
did not believe they would be any
tax increase this year.

The speaker of the house said:

that the lobbying efforts by Pitt
students last year was very
effective. He praised the students

related universities to House and

Task Force Pushes forRe5PonsibI6, Alcohol Use  

By MICHELLE WEDDINGTON
Pitt News Staff Writer

The use of alcohol on Pitt's
campus is -not considered a
problem by campus administration.
However, the Task Force for
Responsible Alcohol ‘Use "is con-
cerned. about developing more
responsible drinking habits among
students. -

_Examples‘ of problems that
sometimes develop are evident on
campus. ‘ '

“Last year a ‘ﬂoor party, with
students drinking was given in a
dormitory. A fire extinguisher was
set-off, furniture torn‘ apart, and
thrown out the window alongwith
paint.“ Bathroom floors" werehlined

with toilet tissue and water. Exit
signs were torn down and glass was
knocked out the doors,” one

_ student said in an interview.
“There was an incident where a A

student was walking home from ‘a;
fraternity party alone. - He fell
down, and wasrobbed,” said Tim

Snyder, assistant director of the

Office of Residence Life.

“The main problem is people
tend to _do things they wouldn’t do
if they were sober. The second is
they’re_lmore vulnerable,” he
added.“ _ _

Lieutenant Charlie Westbrooks,
Community Relations Officer of the
campus‘ police, said‘ more non-
students -than "students were

_arrested for public .drunke‘nness

last year. “In 1977’ to 1978
seventy-two people were arrested
for intoxication and half of them
were students. So far there have
been 67 arrests for drunkenness.”

In making an arrest, Westbrooks
said, the officer ‘approaches you,
then he makes the arrest in the
form of a citation, which has
instructions stating that within a"
certain amount of time you must
pay the fine if you're guilty, or go
to the district magistrate’s office
for a hearing if you're pleading not
guilty.

“We only make an arrest if the
person is immobile, because we
realize students are here for an

‘ education and not to get a record.”

The accessibility of alcohol in
Oakland is tremendous. There are
bars surrounding the Towers".

“There’s no place for students
who don’t want alcohol to go out
and socialize at night,” Snyder
said. “You can go to McDonald’s
to get a cup of coffee and that’s
about it. There’s no snack bar_run
by the University. I think it would
be worth the cost to keepva place
open.” '

Snyder‘ suggested that people
should try to help people with
drinking problems. “Students

should get involved “with people»

who have drinking problems, not
by preaching but by talking to
them,” he said. 

“Times when you feel like you

really want to get loaded, takea

friend along-to take care of you,. let

him hold your billfold and see that _,

you get home safely,” he added.
' The task force
concerned with promoting respon-
sible usage of alcohol, rather than

_ irresponsible drinking, ‘alcoholism

or prohibition,” said Bob LaCivita.
coordinator of the task force.
‘ “When there's ‘alcohol at par-
ties, food should be served——not
expensive cold cuts, but potato
chips, and pretzels,”
suggested. /
“The leading cause of death.
among people in this age group is

' accidents,” said LaCivita. Half of

the accidents on the highway
involve somebody drinking. The
second ‘leading cause is suicide. All
too often the person who's
depressed will turn “to alcohol,” he
stated. - _

HARRISBURG—Just when It H
appeared that the bizarre battle for
the Pennsylvania House of Repre-
sentatives was won b)’_ the
Republicans, a county J“d_8°
yesterday breathed new, if fragile.
life into the Democrats.

Judge Charles Coffroth ruled
that the Democrats can contest the
Somerset County election that a
Republican won on a recount. That
election gave the Republicans a
102-100 margin in the House.

The j_udge’s order gives the
Democrats a slim change at
re-gaining control of the House,
but only if they get and win a
special election in Somerset, and if

they win another special election in
Lehigh County.

The latest twist came one week
after the Democrats won control of
the House by winning a recount,
and then lost that power a day later
when one of their members died of
a heart attack.

If the Somerset election is
thrown out following a Dec. 5
hearing, the Republicans will have
themselves to blame.

Faced with a ﬁling deadline, and

- not sure that incumbent Repub-

lican Kenneth Halverson would win
the recount, Republican supporters
petitioned ‘for a new election on
Monday “as a precautionary

measure.” Halverson said.

On Tuesday, Halverson gained
his 21-vote recount victory and, of
course, had no need for a new
election. But Democrat William
Lloyd’s attorneys quickly appealed
to Coffroth to allow them to
intervene in Halverson’s petition.
Coffroth agreed, saying in his
opinion, “...Public interest in a
lawful and fair election overrides
any other concems...and mandates
a full inquiry into the irregularities
charged by Halverson’s .sup-

porters. Let the chips fall where
they may.” The Democrats will
have to convince Coffroth on Dec. 5
that there were sufficient problems
and irregularities in the Nov. 7
voting to invalidate the election and
set up a special election.

Halverson’s attorneys are con-
ﬁdent that the election will not
-be invalidated.

‘ ‘By no means are we saying now

won,” said a spokesman for
attorney Thomas Saylor.. “We’re
saying that they are not so great as
to change the 21-margin. V

“We were ready to pursue a new
election if Halverson had lost by
ﬁve or six votes. If Halverson had
been down by .21 votes, we
probably would not have pursued

it,” he said. Lloyd’s attorney said V '

they would have no comment until
they study Judge Coffroth’s ruling. ,

During the question-and-answer

break-ins he authorized during his.

administration. He cited this in

.answering a question about

whether the office of the presi-
dency corrupts the office-holder. _

He saidcivil libertarians ‘might .

object to the means used in that
case but he believed they were

Page 6—Friday, December 1, 1978

The bizarre'suicide/ murders involving members of
the People’s Temple, a San-Francisco based religious
cult that transplanted itself to Guyana is indeed a
tragedy—not only because of the deaths of over 800
people, but also because it has fed the voracious
appetites of thrill-seeking addicts of violent and per-
verse incidents. '

First, since the tragedy took place in Guyana, the
incident has been misnamed “the Guyana Tragedy,”
falsely placing the blame on an innocent country
\ . which had nothing to do with the flourishingcult. V

‘ ‘ ' ' Secondly, the media coverage hasbloated the im-
portance of the incident in the wrong way—it stresses
the analogies to Hitler and Manson. and major
magazines fill pages with analyses from the religious

.  - ‘ A angle as members of the People’s Temple believed
' leader Jim Jones to be Christ.
Instead, they would do better to investigate other
cults which have the potential to fall prey to the same

—‘ . tragedy. The People’s Temple has existed for years,

~ yet it was only this fall that anyone attempted to in-

vestigate it. Had attention been focused on the cult

perhaps a year ago, the entire tragedy might have

' been averted. Since almost all members were U.S.

citizens, it is obvious that some knowledge, at least

; by government officials, had to have been obtained
before the group migrated to Guyana. ’

Compare this lack of public information with the
reams of material published“ — about other

A organizations such as Rev. Moon’s group (Moonies)

which aresupposedly equally impenetratable.

So, now pages of photos are plastered on front
pages, and every news commentator can offer his
analyses and maybe some survivors and former
members will write books (one is already being struc-
tured for a January printing). And, no doubt, there

“Helter Skelter.” - .

But the People’s Temple is as dead as its members
who drank the cyanide poisen and it does no good to
mull over the whys and wherefores. We will never
know what motivated Jones, just as we do not know
what motivated Hitler or Manson and speculation
does no one any good. . e e

What is needed now is a clear and hard look at
groups similarto People’s Temple and the findings-
released to the public. This is the only way _to ac-
tually prevent similar tragedies." ’ , «

The current media obsession with the People’s

nival sideshow—an almost unbearable fascination ‘
with the bizarre and repulsive.

adds a, glamour and mystique to the cult which ob-
scures the true depravity of Jones and the blindness
of his unfortunate followers. _

Senate Recommends Major Liquor Soles Revisions

"5"I-IARRISBURG - A Senate com-

mittee recommended (yesterday)
that the state’s Liquor Code, left

sitting too long on the shelf, be

rewritten to give Pennsylvania an
efficient and convenient system of

sales through private stores

Billy Joel

A Columbia

In the entertainment world,
judging a book or album by its
cover is punishable by being forced
to listen to “Disco Duck” for 30
days. On the cover of “S2nd
Street,” Billy Joel is posed with a
trumpet in hand. _ Anyone
expecting to hear Joel play that

trumpet on the album had best

acquire a taste for 13Q. A

Unlike most popular composer-
musicians who find the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow, Joel has
resisted the temptation of allowing-
the quality of his music to suffer in
order to ﬂood the market with his

— albums.

The songs on the album mirror
many of Joel's experiences as a

in the mold of an Iron Butterﬂy

tastelessly abused in “Benny and

Joel quickly returns to the style

idea from him.” . ,

The story appealed to Turner for
a number of reasons.

said. “There’s so much you could

  Rock Concert Scene NotAII Glamour B,

By M.-PATRICK MONAHAN

Pitt. News Staff Writer

Last week, in the first installment of this series on,

. interviewing rock "stars, I told of several of my first and best
' interviews. ' ’ ..

This week it’s time to tell how the works can really get
gummedup in the pursuit of an interview and tell how I've
had my share of bad scenes while trying to cover these
people. '

Kansas and Ambrosia: This was deﬁnitely one of my

more forgettable interviews. Everything went wrong.

Ambrosia at that time was just starting out, yet they
pulled a prima donna act -and came on like they were the
new Beatles.

The interview was scheduled for before their show but
was later changed to after because the band had arrived
late for their soundcheck.

Wayward sons may carry on, but Kansas was iaded 
* ELO was great in concert but backstage guards were something else  ,

. . Fine, I understand that things ‘like’ that can happen.

However, when a friend and I went backstage to talk with
Ambrosia after their well received performance, "they once
again tried to change the time of the interview until later at
their hotel. '- . ' - .

This abrupt switch would cause me_to miss Kansas’
performance S0 I bid Ambrosia fond adieu, went down the
backstage steps of the Syria Mosque and returned to my
seat. I'll bend but won’t break. V 4 . V

Kansas was not exactly in the best of spirits. Dave
Hope, their bassist, was completely exhausted from

roadwork and complained how the band was worried that _

their album at the time, “Leftoverture,” wouldn’t sell and
the band would have to go back to the strategy board to try
and come up with a hit. _
“Leftoverture,” as it turned out, was the album that
catapulted the band tosuperstardom and deservedly so-.

‘ make some phone calls to get in.

However, with‘ Ambrosia being stuck up and Kansas bored

to death, I didn’t exactly have seedmaterial for informative,
‘ copy-« . - ' ‘ ' .
Electric -Light Orchestral Steve Hlllage: At this concert .

_ in winter‘ 1977, a friend and I—were the victims of a ticket

foul-_up.

' An imcompetent and ill-mannered Civic Arena attendan*35‘-'
. told me in rather gruff terms he couldn't find my name on '
--the guest list. ; —

The man refused to letlme try to find it myself? and we

outside into the freezing Pittsburgh night air andtry to

I was upset, being treated like a monkey. in front of my

friend. When I saw anemployee of the promoter at the

door, I decided to_ give _him a piece of my mind. .
(Continued on page 10) '

(Continued from page 8)
this contributes to the overall
balance of the album.
\

“My Life” is a ballad set in an
up-tempo about someone who
abandons New York to make an
attempt at show business one the
west coast. From the beginning of
the song to the end, Joel is the star-,
tickling the keyboards as he did on
his highly "proclaimed “Piano

Man” album. .
“Rosalinda’s Eyes” almost
could be described as a Latin
version of “Just the Way You
Are.” Telling the ‘story of an
entertainer who leaves his Spanish
lover for a shot~at the big time, Joel

relinquishes the instrumental spot-A
‘ light to George Marge on the

sopranino recorder and Hugh

' McCracken.5 on the nylon string

guitar.

Doug Stegmeyer, Liberty De-
Vitto and Steve Khan assist Joel
ably throughout the album and
contribute to its professional
nature.

In the final analysis, there are

, two qualities that contribute to
i ‘make this a quality album. .The

first is that Joel wrote all the music’
as well as the lyrics, and the second

' (thank God) is that_.it. isn't disco.

Theatre to Stage True Story  

V (Con tinued from page 8)
definitions of compassion * and
cruelty and the attitudes of people
toward a ‘non-person’ person like
Merrick.”

Turner used these themes to
structure his play, adding a twisted
theme unique to hishandlingiof the
story. ' ’ ~ _ I
‘ ‘I’ve added a general theme that

we only know peoplein terms of
memory.‘ Since memory is imper-.
"fect, our knowledge of those we
know is imperfect,” he said.

T ..“Elephant Man” sfollows Tur~ ‘
' ner’s playwritiiig tradition of

establishing his plays, in ayfairytale
atmosphere, makingiimagery para-
-mount. In Turner’s _’version, the
imagesiare arranged sequentially.
Few." scenes are realistic. _ C
Technical problems are -a reality
in theater" and “Elephant-. Man”
certainly has had its share. ‘Turner
‘wrote the play for a stage setting he
discovered they _couldn’t build at
Theatre Express. That meant some
. changes. Also, the play calls for 24,

characters; Theatre Expressyhas

only eight actors. Doubling on the .

roles solved that problem.
Finally, Merrick’s costume pre-_

sented somevdifﬁculty. How do
you costume an actor in.tu_berous'

skin sacks? .

“We thought about some way of
doing it, but since‘ the disease gets
worse and worse as the play goes
on, the make-up job would be on

.toolarge a scale. So we decided .

not I ' to use a representational

costume,” Turner said. “Instead, .

we decided to portray the disease
through imagery.”

:‘‘Elephant Man” is.—not ‘Turner’s 
'0.n”ly=contribu_tion to Theatre Ex-

press this season. He will direct

:“As‘sassins” and .“Hotel for.

Cr~imina'ls’«’ later this season,

composed. the score for the 3-‘ .

company_’s'upcoming production of

,“Ma'de, _By Two’.’ and wrote,
« directed and composed the music

for “They Unlit Corridor,” a
vampire vaudeville’ performed
earlier this year.

Turner be1i_eves ‘,‘Elephant

_Man” will appeal to audiences

 
 
   
  

because of the strangetale it tells.

“‘Elephant Man’ is a story about
two people with the best _ of
intentions trying, _but unable, to
make a relationship,” Turner said.
“It shows that it’s not possible for
such desperate people like Merrick
to have_ a relationship. ’ ’

Theatre Express recently opened
.“Elephant Man” on the road in
Buffalo, N.Y. It will premier in
Pittsburgh on Dec. 14 and run
through Jan: 7. ’ 1

(Conrinuedfrom page '10)

As I was arguing with him, my friend came up and asked
who was giving us the shaft, the promoters or the dunce at
the Arena gate. . '

' With that, the promoter’s employee jumped down my
friend's throat and told him it was none of hisvaffair.

I came to the defense of my friend and said we were
getting the shaft since, as it turned out, my name was on

‘the list and it looked as if someone was pulling a fast one

with my tickets. , 
This led to obscenities being exchanged, which nearly

. ' led to blows and eventually led to my friend being ejected
. from the premises by the police.

I was stuck. I had an interview scheduled and didn’t
want to rip off Hillage by not showing up, since I had talked
to him on the phone the night before.

Hillage, a modern day psychedelic ﬂower child from
Great Britain, was sympathetic when I told him about my
messy hassle but I was so burned up I didn't really care
about what he had to say. ' '

Genesis: This was another screwed up affair since I
never did get the scheduled interview and nearly’ got
arrested that night too. A

I.was almost done in by a loud-mouthed belligerent
policeman who was trying to clear the backstage area of the
Arena with storm trooper tactics. .

When he confronted me, I told him I was a reporter and
was waiting for the ﬁnal word from Genesis’ manager on
whether they were going to do the interview.

He told me the only person I was going to interview was
someone outside the Arena and started to push me toward

the door.

A As he started this, I decided to write his badge number
down and then got off a classic comeback line: “If that’s

the case, sir, I'll have to ﬁle a complaint tomorrow morning
with your superior charging police _ brutality . and
harassment.” _ _
He then called me an ugly name. turned on 1115 bed and

walked away totally embarrassed at the thought of me
calling his bluff in front of all the other people backstage he

“boring and stupid since all you do in them is talk about
how great you are.”

Recalling some of my many interviewing disasters and
near arrests, I. sometimes think Blackmore is one of the
smartest rockers I ever talked to.

was trying to push around. I loved it.

Nazareth: This was a total journalistic dud. Once again,
there were the ever-lurking ticket hassles that always pop
up at the most inopportune times (usually when you tell
your guest there won't be any). .

I missed the headliner Kansas (1 never had much luck
covering these guys) and also Nazareth, whom I was
supposed to interview after their set at their hotel.

V Nazareth’s lead singer, Dan McCafferty, and the band's

A1 two road managers who accompanied me up to his hotel

room, were jerks. . ,

They acted as if they wanted to be back at the bar where
their party was drinking themselves into oblivion. Half the
time I couldn’t decipher McCafferty’s thick Scottish accent.-

Sensing their desireto pack it in, I just said, “Thanks,
but no thanks," and left the room totally disgusted.

Until this day the only thing I can remember McCafferty
saying was he hated Linda Ronstadt’s version of “Blue
Bayou,” a popular song at the time. ' I

I chalked this interview up as a total waste of time and
money—it was two bucks for a beer at the hotel bar. A
definite rip off. . .

Ritchie Blackmore: What do you say to a man who’ is
throwing darts at a watermelon when you’re trying to get
up the nerve to ask" for an interview? Nice shot? ..

As it turned out, Blackmore, the dark and mysterious
former Deep Purple guitarist, said he wouldn't "do an
interview since he never gave them. ‘He saidithey were

Karsh’s improvisation and experi-
mentation.

An upbeat mood was set by the
‘duo's ﬁrst number, “Breezin,” a
song popularized’ by George
Benson.’ The next number was the
jazz standard “There Will Never
Be "Another You.” Karsh’s own
composition “The Ducks of Bos-
ton,” which had abit of the Jobim
samba sound, showed off Karsh’s
compositional talents. Another

You Are," was followed by
' “Masquerade,’f again a song done
recently by Benson. r

aggressively, contributing a sense
of building energy that climaxed in
Karsh’s _solo arrangment of Paul
McCartney’s “Blackbird.” This
number began with a bit of
interesting avant garde improvi-
sation, ﬂowing into a relaxed
melody, then exploding into an
aggressive hard jazz chordal
improvisation a la Larry Coryell. -

An energetic denouement was
provided by the Chick Corea
composition, “Spain.” The next
number was the ballad “When
Sonny Gets Blue,” allowing the
audience an opportunity to just lay
back and listen, followed by the
happy calypso “St. Thomas.”

WHEELING, W. Va. — Tim

' Grgurich's Panthers, whose recent

habit has been to begin seasons in

unexpected and heartbreaking‘

manners, started another season in

‘ ’ unorthodox fashion‘ Wednesday

evening.

‘This time, however, neither
Grgurich nor anyone else connect-
ed with his team is complaining.

A string of surprises, most of
them pleasant for Pitt, began as the
players were introduced, continued
through most of Pitt’s 107-82 win
against little Rio Grande and was
not concluded until the Panthers
left their locker room and boarded
the big McDonald's bus outside
Wheeling’s Civic Center.

. In fact, a large surprise involved
opponent and game site. Pitt’s
past few seasons began with losses
or close wins against small-college
teams. To avoid such a start this
season, Grgurich scheduled Rio
whose Redmen can
perhaps best be described as a
miniature college team.

Rio Grande’s‘ handicap—about
ﬁve inches, at each position-J-was
evident ﬁrst when Sam Clancv.
(6-foot-6, 245 pounds), Pitt’s ﬁrst

introduced player, was met. at"

center court by Vince Phelps, a Rio

Grande guard who is not quite so"

large. He is, in face, one foot and
100 pounds short.

Clancy smiled as he shook
Phelps’ hand; Phelps kept careful
watch on that hand, then shook his
head as hewalked away.

Phelps and his teammates (the

Redmen’s ﬁrst ﬁve were listed at _

6-7, 6-3, 6-0 6-0, and 5-6). were well
coached and determined, exposing
several Panther nerves during the
game’s first few minutes, but Pitt’s
height and skill allowed it ' to"
outrebound the Redman, 34-6, and-
outscore them, 57-40, in the ﬁrst
half. .

Clancy, more important than
ever to Pitt after Ed Scheuer—
mannfs ankle iniurv (surgery is
scheduled today), scored 19 points
and gathered 12 easy rebounds
during the first half, .but more
noteworthy was" something he
brought from -Pittsburgh—a
smooth jump shot that was

'6 stunningly effective when Clancy

was 12 to 15 feet from the basket.
Three other Panthers—Wayne
Williams, Terry Knight and Sam
Ellis—also had 10 or more points
before halftime. Dan Purcell, a
6-foot ‘guard, paced Rio Grande’s
first half with a pair of_ rebounds.
P_urcell's shooting (16 points)
and that of Mark Swain (14 points)

' allowed Rio Grande to_make the

game mildly interesting during the
ﬁrst 20 minutes.

Pitt wore down Rio Grande in the
second half; .Grgurich’s first 10
players cruised to a lead that
exceeded 30 points i and a fresh-
man-studded mop-up crew allowed
the Redmen to cut the‘ margin
nearer to 20.. -

Clancy, already building a
statistical base, ﬁnished with 29
points and 18 rebounds. Sam Ellis,
6-6 junior college transfer, collect-
ed 26 points and 13 rebounds.
Knight had 14 points and 12
rebounds; Williams contributed 15

, points and seven rebounds.

But what may be most important

to Grgurich, his team and Panther 1

followers this season is not the
impressive statistics, the easy win,
the improvementtof Clancy or ‘the
hope that‘ newcomers Ellis’ and
Carlton Neverson offered with their
play. The.biggest development in
Wheeling Wednesday evening was
the attitude of Pitt’s players during
the game and after it. And that,- to_
anyone familiar with and sympath-
etic toward Pitt basketball, was a
welcome surprise. '

‘_‘I was impressed with the Pitt

players’ attitude during the second
half,” Redmen coach Arthur
Lanham said. “Even though they
knew.the game was over, they

respected our players and made a

game of it.” -
. That was the. Panthers’

room in which Pitt dressed afterthe
game. Williams, senior co-captain,
perhaps summed his team’s
attitude, and how it differs from
that of recent season, best:

. “Every team I’ve played on here
had talent,” Williams said, per-
haps remembering the talent of

first -
. display of exemplary attitude. The
-second came in the puny locker

team not only for each upcoming opponent, but also
for the psychological grinds of a longseason. He is
theone who must be calmest in the face of adversity
and must be prepared to make split-second decisions

move. He is the master tactician. Therefore, he is the
man who affects the outcome of the game. Right?

Wrong. ' 1

“Coaching is the only profession I know where a
bunch of 18-year-olds are running around playing a
game with your paycheck in their mouths,” said Al
McGuire, former Marquette basketball coach.

More times than not, coaches get more credit than
they deserve when their team wins and take too much
blame for a loss. Pitt head coach Jackie Sherrill
seems to fall into the latter half of that statement.-

Many fans, spoiled by the success of a national

“disastrous” seasons, 9-2-1 in 1977 and‘ 8-3 in 1978.
What makes matters worse, the Panthers have suf-
fered consecutive defeats to both Notre Dame- and
Penn State. And so many fans, anxious to relieve

the most obvious one, Sherrill.

Fans who claim Pitt’s program never will asend to
the heights it reached under Johnny Majors as long
as Jackie Sherrill’ is the coach are likely the same ones

-who thought Rick Trocano never would be a com-
petent quarterback.

Sherrill has made mistakes, and some were more
glaring than others, but none were fatal enough to
cost Pitt even a single game.

In last year’s opener against Notre Dame, Sherrill
failed to give either Wayne Adams or Tom Yewcic

practice time with new center Tom Brzoza. When
Matt Cavanaugh broke his wrist and no one else
proved capable of taking a snapfrom center, Sherrill
became the villian. - ‘

Granted, this unfamiliarity may have caused a
couple of the fumbled snaps, but the defense rose to
the occasion and the Panthers still led at halftime.
The quarterbacks continued to soak their hands in
concrete, however, and four fumbles later Pitt lost.
Yewciceand Adams had to have at least 10 years of
organized football behind them’ prior to that Sep-

tember afternoon in 1977. One of them should have_

had enough poise and should have been able to get
enough sideline practice to be able to step in and take

a snap from center, the most fundamental of all-

football plays.
Sherrill took more abuse for playing Cavanaugh
with a cast on his left wrist in a 17-17 tie with Florida.
It. is doubtful Pitt would have been able to score 17
points against the Gators without Cavanaugh in the
lineup, but the Panthers still_ would have won the
game if Joe Gasparovic did not get a punt blocked
late in the game. It is not the coach’s fault if
someone misses a block and a kick is blocked, which
is what ultimately caused the tie.
Against Penn State, it was the hand signals. Hand
signals had nothing to do with three Cavanaugh in-

terceptions, two in the end zone. Hand signals are

The. criticism continued through this season. The
victories didn’t seem to be impressive enough, -and
losses simply were ‘unacceptable. - ‘
The key to coaching on any level‘ is talent. Pitt cer-
tainly.does not lack for quality athletes, but mostly

, all of them are underclassmen, who are ‘prone to

mistakes. A fumble here, a couple penalties there
and an interception for good measure spell _defeat

more often than» an error committed from the-

sidelines. . ..
The Panthers are certainly one of the youngest
teams in the Top 20; good, young teams often grow
into mature, great ones. Nebraska won back-to-back
national championships in 1971 and 1972 _after its
sophomores matured. Penn State currently sits atop

.the polfs after its freshmen and sophomores became

juniors and seniors. V
Like his team, Sherrill is young and will mature af-
ter . "being exposed to the many different situations
that crop up during a game and a career. A ‘ .
“All coaching really is is recognizing a situatio

’ and remembering something that worked before,”

said Dean Smith, basketball coach at North.
Carolina. “Sometimes, it comes down to remem-
bering what didn’t work and avoiding it.”

Pitt easily could have slipped back into the patsy
division after Majors went marching home_, but
Sherrill went" out and had two fine’ recruiting years.
If he is able to continue to build on the program as
he had done, Sherrill will be able to look back at this
criticism and laugh. If he is not able to continue the
job he has begun, he will deserve it.

Pan therette Swimmers Dro wn Princeton, 9!-39

Pitt News Staff Writer

Coming off one of its V most
impressive showings in recent
history, Pitt's women’s swim team
(1-0) meets North Carolina tonight
at Trees Pool.

Under first-year coach Dick
Bradshaw, the Pantherettes won 11
of’ 15 events and defeated Eastern
power Princeton, 91-39, in the
season opener.

“It was the best meet we’ve had
in a long time,” Bradshaw said.
“Princeton was the second best

Bradshaw, however, is not so
optimistic about tonight's meet.

‘ ‘North Carolina is devastating, ’ ’
the Pantherette coach said. “They
probably have one of the top three
teams in the nation. They had an
exceptional recruiting year, maybe
the best in the country. They have
a lot of depth and probably are too
strong for us.” .

Pitt (14th) and North Carolina

improve. According to Bradshaw,
tonight’s meet could be the only
thing separating the Pantherettes,
5-4 last season, from an undefeated
season.

The meet .will feature 1980
Olympic hopefuls Kathy Stetler of
Pitt and North Carolina’s Janice
Nape, a veteran of .the 1976
Olympics at Montreal. Stetler and
Nape, were teammates several
years ago on Pitt's Aquatic.Club,
coached by Bradshaw. Stetler and
Nape now are rivals and will

to be close enough to hang on the
rim to score. Instead, he swished
the majority of his shots from the
outside but threw in a few inside
moves for good’ measure, while
clearing 18 rebounds." 0
According to coach Tim Grgur-
i'ch, Clancy's outside shooting
ability had been evident in
preseason practice, where he was
encouraged to take the jumpers.
“Since last year, we’ve had three
guys working with Sammie on the
shot,” , ‘said Grgurich. “Tom
Booth, Mike Schaeffer (an assistant
coach at Carnegie-Mellon) and Jim
Bolla have taken the time to help
develop his outside talent, and
Sammie has really come through.
You could tell he’s developed
conﬁdence by the way he didn’t
hesitate for a second in taking the

. longer shot.’ ’.

Pitt wrestling coach Dave Adams
is drilling his team on “a few
technical aspects” in preparation

p for the Penn State Invitational at‘-
- State College this weekend.

“This is a very strong preseason
tournament,” Adams claimed.
“It’s going to be very competi-

tive.” » .

Much more competitive than the
Panthers’ season-opening. 20-11
loss to Eastem. Wrestling League
foe Bloomsburg State Nov. 16. Pitt
fell behind early that night, 12-3, to
the Bisons and never were able to
recover the lead. A

“We weren’t 'quite as far along
as I hoped we would be,” Adams
admitted. “We have a lot of desire
on this team but have a lot of
coaching to do.” _

Pitt will be hard pressed .to do
well’ at ‘Penn State's 1 tournament,

Pitt's 800-meter freestyle, relay
team (Stetler, Julie Terrell, Amy
Jackson ‘and Linda Frankenbach)
ﬁnished ﬁrst at Princeton and
qualiﬁed for the Association of
Intercollegiate. Athletics for
Women national championships.
Bradshaw expects more swimmers
to qualify in tonight's meet.

Qualifying for the league's
Eastern regional championships

were Stetler (200- and 500-yard

freestyle); Jackson (200-yard free-
style); Frankenbach and Terrell
(100-yard backstroke); Suzanne

Rio Grande was the perfect
opponent for Clancy to try out the
role of jump-shot specialist. There

_was little need to score by way of

the boards anyway, because with a
comfort_able lead throughout the
entire second half, muscling in

over. the much shorter Redmen .

would have been sporting, at the
very least. ' \

"‘If he (Clancy) had wanted to
play_ the entire game inside, there
was no way we could have stopped
him,” commented Rio Grande
coach Arthur Lanham.

The same could be said about
Panther forward -Sam Ellis. A
junior college transfer, Ellis admit-
ted to being “a little nervous at the
start of the game” but controlled.
the inside by reaching the
basketball ﬁrst with a variety of
leaps and bounds that would have

regarded by pollsters as one of the
most prestigious and difficult to
win. ' The opposition includes
wrestling powerhouses Michigan,
Michigan State, Clarion, Auburn,
Clemson, Maryland and the host
Nittany Lions. -
Michigan and Michigan State are
second and third, respectively,

behind second-ranked Iowa in the

Big Ten Conference; Auburn is one
of the top teams of the Southeast-
ern - Conference; "Clemson and
Maryland are predicted to ﬁght for
the Atlantic Coast Conference
crown; and Clarion and PSU are
Pitt's rivals in the Eastern league.

“It’s a great chance for the guys
to get experience against top-notch
competition,” Adams said. “Our
wrestlers _will ﬁnd out just what
they have to do to compete on that
level.” . ' .

Last. year, the Panthers were

A able to live up to the test by placing

Pulley, Sue Geyerl and Nila

DeJesus (100-yard breaststroke); . in

Nancy Henry, Jackson, Jamie
Conley, Terrell and Patti Davis
(100-yard -freestyle); Julie Klotz_
and Pulley (200-yard individual
medley); Sue Dowd (S00-yard

freestyle); Henry, Sandy Taylor

and Terrell (100-‘yard butterﬂy);
Pulley. DeJesus and Geyer (200-
yard breaststroke); and both 800-
yard freestyle relayteams. '

Jackson, Frankenbach, Terrell,
Henry, Klotz and Taylor are all
freshmen. - ’

Sam’
made Superman proud.

Ellis, too,- is adapt_ at playing
both inside and outside, but with
the absence of Ed Scheuermann,

Ellis most likely will ﬁnd himself

paired with Clancy in the middle
against future opponents.‘

“I enjoy playing inside with
Sammie,” said Ellis. “Three-
fourths of the time it helps just to
have him there.” V

Although Pitt - handled _the
Redmen with relative ease, Ellis
pointed out’ that “this game
doesn’t prove anything, really.”
Massachusetts is no Rio Grande,
so Saturday’s game atthe Field
House will, for practical game

purposes, be a season opener as -
well as home opener. If the “new’-’ V

outside game along with the inside,
it could be an eye-opener, too.

into the national limelight as the

‘Maria Paris-came to Pitt on a

“spur of the moment” decision.

And Pitt’s tennis program is lucky
she did.

In her four years as Pitt’s top

woman player, Paris brought a

taste of southern tennis to ~the

Eastern region. Born in Argentina,
Paris grew up in real tennis country
+the Tampa Bay area of Florida.

"I graduated from high school in

~ the perfect year, since 1975 was the

first year that they could give
said
Paris.

Several factors combined in her
decision to attend Pitt instead of
oneof 15‘ other schools.

—‘‘The competition in the West

was too rough. I knew I wouldn't‘

be playing No. 1 or 2, maybe just 3,
4 or 5. - It also was too far from
home and would have been too
expensive to go back and forth,”
she said. '

Paris also had a desire to get
some experience in Eastern tennis

Maria Paris Sp

after playing ‘in the South all her
life. Pitt’s good offer and
prestigious name also inﬂuenced
her to leave the sunny ‘South for a
few years. .

“It’s a decision I still wonder
about,” Paris added.

Paris has played since she was
12, earning Florida and national
ranking in juniors competition (12
to 18 years) every year. “Tennis is
really big in Florida. The
competition is unreal,” she said.

“My goal when I came here was
to be No. 1 in the East, and it’s still
the same,” said Paris.

She has gone to nationals and
played her way to_the semiﬁnals
and ﬁnals of every tournament in
which Pitt participates. But she still
hasn’t‘won one and sets her sights
on the spring season. .

“I’_m either No. 1, 2, 3 or 4,” she
said. ‘g‘I don’t'really know for sure
because there are about four of us
that beat each other all the time.”

Her recent victory over ‘Penn

of satisfaction to Paris.

“My goal was to beat her. She
was the only one who ruined my
school record. I had a head case
after the ﬁrst time I lost to her,”
Paris said. After eight losses to
McManus, Paris ﬁnally defeated
her foe in the third set of their
recent encounter. ‘

Lack of effective practices
hindered Paris in improving her
game, she believes. ‘

“Until this year, I haven’t had a
practice where I really could work.
To improve your tennis game, you

have to play with someone who can V

beat’ you,” she said.
As a freshman, Paris practiced

‘with the men’s team to receive

adequate challenge. ' V

“The guys didn't mind that I
practiced with them. It was no big
deal. I enjoyed playing more with
the guys,” she said. —

Low — quality women’s tennis
greeted Paris when she arrived as a
freshman, but she believes the
team has gotten -progressively
better. “This year, we had a very
good team and ‘wefeel like more of
a team,” she said. i ‘ '

“The team always- calls me a

party pooper because I always go‘ to

bed early before a match. - I do
always like to know who I play and I
think about how I’m going to

play,” Paris said. “What helps me
most is playing every day.”

Pitt has no indoor facilities and
only seven poorly located outdoor
courts. Although the courts were
resurfaced this year, Paris said

"they were just blacktopped by a

paving ‘company,’ rather than being
properly done by a court company.
“Your season is never over. You
have to play every day. To play
tennis, you have to be in shape, use
your mind, be accurate, and you
-have to use it all together,” she
said. ' I

A journalism major, Paris’
immediate future lies in her tennis.

Because of a possibly ruptured ._—._I

back disc, however, Paris believes
she may be unable to sustain
rigorous daily professional play.
“I’m in a lot of pain all the time
when I play,”‘she added.

If unable to join the pro circuit, 2

Paris. would «like to ‘ go into
coaching and eventually return to
the Tampa Bay area,

“Whatever I do do, it will be in
tennis,” she added.
