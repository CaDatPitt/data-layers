vocation on New Year’s
Resolutions

 

 

I5Q1NTERs ARE GIVEN

 

The first student assembly of the

V new year was held in the banquet

room of the Soldiers’ Memo—ri.al Hall
last Wednesday. The Chancellor ad-
dressed the student body, emphasiz-
ing the. fact that each one should
strive to make the new year the best
year of his life. "He said that he
heartily agreed with the New Year’s
resolution idea since it showed a de-
_sire for people to make themselves
better even though the resolutions
were not faithfully kept. He also said
that insofar as the University was con-
cerned each one connected with it
should endeavor to make it a banner
year especially because this will be -the
-.cent¢nni,al year. In regard to the stu-
dent building campaign he stated that
he was sure the people of Pittsburgh
would respond to the students’ appeal
and\that the students would receive
the hearty co-operation of all those

,_oﬂicia1l=y connected with the -institu—,

tion. Mr. Harvey was then calledito
the .platform and gave some very in_—
teresting and valuable pointers which
should help each student considerably
in getting his cards signed.’ Dr.
George told of an interesting experi-
ence he had at one time while so‘lic‘it—
ing money for at s-imilar use. W. F.
Campbell, ’12, chairman of the Board
of Control, stated that the organiza-
tion of the student body had been
-completed and everything Was in.
-working order.‘ T. M..Kirk, ’l3, made_
a short but emphatic speech, nad the
Chancellor concluded the meeting
with a few additional worlds of en-
couragernent. it

Large Number of Candidates for
Parts in Historical Play-

 

The historical play, “The Vision of
She Who Knows,” which is to have
an important place in the program of
the one hundred and twenty-ﬁfth an-
niversary of the University, was com-
pleted during the Christmas recess.
The selection of the cast only re-
mains A incomplete. ‘

Last night, in response to the first
call for candidates for positions in

 cast. a large number of $.t.ud..ents

came out to _try for positions. A very
successful meeting A was held, and
those :in.cha’rg.e of the play were able
to get an idea .of‘the pability of those
students who. came out. Several se-
lections were made for various char-
acters in the .te_nt.atiye play. V

Several parts in the play must be
performed by women, and this gives
all the “c.o.-eds” with drarnatic ability
a ch,a,n;c-e to h_ave good parts in the
“Vision ,of She Who K.n.o»Ws.*”

There are between -60 and 80 per-
sons needed for the presentati.on of
the play. Of this number there Jwilvl
be some 15 speaking parts for men
and three or four zfor women.

THE OWL.

Much complaint has been heard this
year collcerning the failure of the 1913
Owl Board to attend to its duties. It
is certainly true that this year's an-
nual is not, progressing with its ac-
cus-tomed speed. But at last the
Junior class and the board are begin-
ning to awaken to the seriousness of
the situation. It is now almost the
middle of January and but little work
on the Owl has been done. This crit-

W icism does not apply to the whole
board; certain members have at-
tempted to do their share. But the

board as a whole has so far been a
failure. During the past week, how-
ever, there has been a great change in
the attitude of thelboard. Ifthe mem-
bers of -the Owl staff for this year de-
termine to devote their whole eh-
ergies to this task until their book is
ﬁnished, success may yet be attained.
Now that they have begun to make an
honest "effort to atone for rt-hei-r past
negligence, all censure should be With-
held and every effort made to help
them in the task before ‘them. -Every
loyal Pitt man will give his best ef-
forts to ‘ena3bl'e the board to publish
an ‘Owl which will be an honor to
the University. .

With the board showing -an ener-
getic spirit, the Iunior class should
show a greater lspitit of loyalty. It is
after all, not so much the fault ‘of the
-staff -as of the class of 1913 that the
book has been so -long delayed. Had
the ‘class -showed the p»ro€p‘er spirit, the
men Elected to publish this book
would not have dared to wait so long.
Had the Juniors done their duty the
‘ob's'tacle's confrontirrg the board’ would
long ago have been removed. In "the
past the members of this class have so
acted that ‘the voatsider would think
that the publication of the Owl was a
matter of extreme .ind:i§e‘rence to
them. We wish to warn this clan that
unless this spirit is changed, the class
of 1913 will ‘go down in the history
of the University as the only class
"which disgraced its‘el?f by failing to
issue *our.stud-ent -‘annual. A sudd.e‘n
and a ‘great change is n‘eed‘ed immedi-
ately. We hope that the Juniors will
most ‘speedily -“awake-. ‘

 

GRADUATE MANAGERS.
There is gradually growing in this
school a strong sentiment in favor of
the system of graduate managers.
This plan was adopted by the Athletic
Committee several years ago and it
has been most successful. It is in
force. in many ‘other schools. Some of
the most successful college organiza-
tions in the country are now managed
by graduate managers who have re-
ceived t'h”e’i'r training 3.0 assistants dur-
ing th‘e‘i"r u‘nd‘e‘rgradu’ate career. We’
are now in this University malkingl
every effort to strengthen our student
*or.ga?‘niza’tio"ns. One of the ‘strongest:
aids we can «pos-sibly Tsecure «in this
‘work is the institution -of the graduate,
manager system. ~By__'such a method?
of choosing the ma‘n'agers the i’trture_
manager receives his ‘trai*nI'rn‘g .%1s._aﬂ-V
assistant before being placed in charge
of the organization. The various wcllufbs,
of ‘the iﬂzhool who are foncfed to havef

great help if they would decide to
choose their student managers by
competit‘io‘n and _would then choose
from their student managers a com-
petent graduate manager.

A new speaker or writer generally
needs an introduction to the public-
that rather miscellaneous group, which
makes or unmakes popul~arity——-but in-
formality is to -be the keynote of this
department (I forgot to mention that
this is to be on the program here-
after), so‘, if you will pardon the lack
of conventionality, we take it for
granted the preliminary steps are
completed. It is such awpleasure to
meet people, you know!

Of course you are curious about the
name I have adopted for this section
of the Weekly. Rather unique, is it
not? Oh! well let us not quibble
about the title—not much in a name
anyway. But let me explain just a
little.

Pitt Pats, now let me see: “Pitt”
stands-for Old Uni, most assuredly,
and Pats-—-‘wel-1, honestly I don’t know.
it had four letters and I thought it
would look well in print. There is"
to be no creed nor purpose in Pitt
Pats, as you observe, but permit me
to drop a sly hint. One Week they
may be “pats” and the next they are
likely to be “brick bats.” Any person
from the short gentleman, wh-ose ini-
tials are S. -B. McC., to the long nosed
knight of the broom in the professor's
dormitory may appear in these col-
umns. It is going to be a continuous
perforinance with every student and
instructor (and our suffragette friends
the co-eds) included in the bill.

In candid words, this is to be the
University ‘mirror, wherein will be re-
ﬂected the actual happenings without
deviation -from the facts. If the glass
records a pleasing image ‘or an un-
pleasant one, remember it is .a mir-
rored view. I cannot refrain from
criticism when such ‘is necessary (a
homely m-an cansnot mush a mirror if
it reveals his -ungainly feat'ure's), but

_ I do ‘hope to use ‘the word “boost”

much more than that all-exp'ress'ive

slang term “knock.” ,

The Prowler is going ‘to be in the

the club meetings; ‘a‘n1o‘ng the fratern-
ity men; among the non~fr.aternity

week, there are some warnings and
announcements to make. First, be on
the lookout for The Prowler; he is
like the poor, “with us always;” con-
stantly be on the alert and ever ready
to read your name in this column.
Some day I may introduce you to my
typewriter! Second, any communica-
tion properly signed will at all times
be welcome on my desk. In fact, I
am anxious -to receive opinions from
any person on all phases of University
life. I cannot promise to print all
your letters, but where comment is
necessary I shall always be gratiﬁed
in so d-oing. Letters to receive proper
attention should be addressed to The
Prowler, in care of The Pitt Weekly.
Third, this department has absolutely
no connection with the editorial policy
of this publication. These letters are
not to be editorials nor any repre-
sentation of the editor’s opinions (it
may be ‘my privilegevor duty to gently
frizzle the Weekly sometime-—let us
hope not). We are going to have
this c_orner of the paper for a con-
genial chat, ‘that’s all. Some time the
Pitt Pats will be shcwers of destruc-
tion and other weeks ‘they will be
showers of blessing.
The Prowler.

Editor’s Note. —— This department
will be a feature of the Weekly for
the remainder of the year. If you are
not already a subscriber hand in your
name at once, as you cannot afford to
mi.ss a single one of “The Prowle'r’s”
letters. They will make admirable
souvenirs of your University days.

Man. Box  

Editor Pitt Weekly:

Sir:—S0me time ago through the
Pitt Weekly letter box, I called at-
tention to some inconsistencies -in the
manner of observing the rules of the
students’ library, located in State hall;
and it is with much regret that I again
call your attention to the same condi-
tions. The conditions are even worse
now than when I ﬁrst made a protest
against them.

Two days before school closed for
the Christmas recess I was reading at
one of the tables in the library; and
also, at the same table were two other
students. Suddenly the librarian
came over to the table and told the
other two students to leave the li-
brary, aswthey were disturbing the en-
tire room with their conversation. I
was within a yard of the two persons
and I could not hear them talking
(there is nothing the matter with my
hearing, either); yet the librarian, at
her desk three yards from the table
said they were disturbing the entire
room. As the two students left the
room, every ‘person in the room
smiled a smile of disgust at the kinder-
garten like action of the librarian.

It might b-e well to bear in mind the

_fact that only ten minutes before the

librarian had been vigorously running
the typewriter at her desk. However,
it may be that a typewriter is less
disturbing than to have talking going
on that cannot be heard a yard away,
even if the typewriter can be heard
half way down the hall leading out of
the library.

I have ‘heard several complaints of
a like nature lately. The University
of Pittsburgh is not running a kinder-
garten and all kindergarten tactics
should be abolished. 2

Yours truly,
A; Junior.

We believe that if the complainant
were to remember the c-rowded condi-
tion of the library, he might have
more sympathy for the librarian and
her troubles.—Ed. ’

8 a Return Next Fall

Pitt adherents will be glad to learn
that the rumor of Dallenbach’s return
to the University has been conﬁrmed
and that one of Pitt’s greatest guards
will be eligible for football next year.
Dallenbach played on the champion-
ship 1910 team and was thought by
many to be the best guard that ever
donned the--moleskins for the Gold

and Blue. He also won his letter at
track in the weight events as he
scored in the intercollegiate. At the

close of the school year he decided to
go to Cornell University the following
term, much’ to the sorrow of his
friends in Pittsburgh. His heart was
with us, however, and he returned to
this city a week before the State game
to help Coach Thompson prepare the
’Varsity for the crucial test of the
season. He will ﬁnd that Pittsburgh
is “all his” when he returns nextjfall.

Davy Sheehan May P
"Coach. Track Team

Director Miller has been busy dur-
ing the past ten days trying to °secure
the services of Davy Sheehan, a fa-
mous sprinter and former Pitt Track
man. Coach Sheehan is the best avail-
able man for this position, but he will
be hard to get as his business duties
may require all of his time. _

Pitt needs a track coach to take ‘up
his duties at” once, as the schedule in-
cludes -two indoor meets in February
and is nearly completed with four
good meets in April and May. The
ovalis nearly completed and will be
ready for workas soon as the weather
makes outdoor work possible.

If Director Miller is unsuccessful in
making a trade with Sfheehan, he will
take up negotiations with several
other good men at once.

Football Letters Granted

At the last meeting of the Athletic
Committee seventeen men who parti-
cipated in football this year were
awarded letters. They are Capt. Jack
Lindsay, ’12; Capt.-elect Polly Galvin‘
’l3; Auggie Blair, '12; ‘Red Smith, ’l5;
Jim Stevenson, ’12; Chuck Soles, ’l5;
Raz Quailey, ’l2; Hube Wagner, '14;
Tillie Dewar ’l2; George Brown, ’l3:
Ross Feightner, ’13; Kernohan, ’l5;
Dillon, ’14; Leahy, ’l3; Gehlert, ’l4;
Connelly, _’l4 and Graves, ’l5.
say, Quailey, Stevenson, Dewar and
Blair will be lost by graduation.

Four of the seventeen men awarded
letters were of the Class of 1915
which speaks well for the class .and
also for future ’Varsity teams.

The Junior class -is certainly acquir-
ing an envious record-—-it is noted for
its school spirit.

Direct Work at New Stadium ~

The ﬁrst step taken by the advisory
board recently appointed by Chancel-
lor McCormick was to recommend the

appointment of Chas. S. Miller as Ath-“

letic Director of the University and
the recommendation was adopted at

-once by the Athletic Committee. His

appointment was hailed with joy by
Pitt’s undergraduate body as this man
is well known to most ofthe athletes
and sport loving contingent. '
Mr. Miller graduated from Pitts-
burgh.High School where he cap-
tained -the baseball nine and ever since
hasgbeen closely connected with ath-
letics as competitor, manager, coach

or in an official way. He was the cap--
tain of the Pittsburgh A. C. track‘ ..

team from 1890 to 1896, was chairman

of the athletic committee of the same"

club from 1894 to 1897 .an.d served as
vice president in 1898." When hockey
was in vogue at Duquesne Garden, he
was president_of the league and later
managed the P. A. C. team which
made a splendid record. He was the
oﬂicial handicapper of the A. A. U. in
Western Pennsylvania for a number
of years and acted in the same ca-
pacity for the Pittsburgh Ska-ting
Club. Mr. Miller is undoubtedly the

best known man in local track affairs -

"as he is nearly always connected with
local meets and his face is familiar to
all local amateur athletes both inter-
collegiate and interscholastic. ,

The addition of Tree’s Stadium and
the wonderful expansion of.ath.letics
at the University was the cause of
this late action of tl.c committee, as
the management must increase with
the. different branches of sport. The
gymnasium, according to the con-
tractors, -will be ready for occupancy
late in February and the new director
will take hold of the physical develop-
ment of the athletes as soon as pos-
sible. A thorough system of com-
pulsory training will be outlined by
him and a record cf each student's
physical -tests will be kept. He will
encourage and aid the formation of in-
terclass and interdcpartment teams
and will also develop untried material
for the ’Varsity. A

His work as laid down bythe Ath-
letic Committee will be to prescribe
gymnasium work to‘improve physical
deﬁciencies, to employ suitable in-
structors and supervise their work and
to have charge of the swimming tank.

“Doe” Flint will Coach Team;
MaeQ1iown Completes Schedule

The most. important step taken by

 

Graduate Manager Hurst in a basket-

b.all way early this season was the ap-
pointing of “Doc.” Flint as coach.

.F1int played several years for the‘Uni-

versity of Pennsylvania and captained
the team during his last y-ear in col-
lege. He has followed the game
closely since his graduation as he has
oﬁiciated in local games for the past
several years. The new coach is de-
termined to develop a winning team
for -this season and is particularly anx-
ious to clean up on the eastern trip
which Manager MacQuown has ar-
-trips have always
proved disastrous to Pitt basketball
teams in (the past. His task willnot
be an easy one as the material this
season is much lighter than usual and
most of the eastern ﬁves are com-
posed of big, heavy fellows who are
hard to beat. .
Manager MacQuovm’s schedule is
about the best ever arranged for a
Pitt basketball team and he deserves

_much credit for his energy and inter-

est. in this work. Through the cour-
tesy of the Pittsburgh Athletic Com-
mittee, the first three games at home

Twill be played on their splendid floor,

as_ the gymnasium is not yet in shape
for use. Holders of "student books

_and P. A. A. members will be ad-

mitted to these three games: Waynes-
burg was played on the ﬁfth of Jan-
uary, Juniata will be met on the nine-
teen-th and Western Reserve on the
‘twenty-sixth. _ , J
U The new’ gymnasium will probably
be opened with a game with Carnegie
Tech on February second, but this is

"not assured yet as the work‘ is.still

moving along rather slowly.

shouldshow great improvement as

for many years and
knows the game from the’ crack of the

of time between the meetings of the

of having immediate action on certain

pointed an Advisory Board. His se-
lec-tion is certainly a splendid one as
he named men that have been a great
factor in the advancement of Pitt

der Co-Operative System.

 

The University is completing ar-
rangements fora dinner at which will
be in attendance the faculty. and the
heads of the concerns with which the
co-operative work is being_carried on
in the University. This system of co-
operative work is producing better re-
sults every day. A number of the
graduates of last year’s class have
been placed in better positions than

those in which they started. All _the

members of the classes working dur-
ing the winter term this year have
been well placed. The number of stu-
dents asked for by tne concerns was
greater than the school could supply.
Dr. Bishop of the Engineering School
expressed himself, when seen by the
Pitt Weekly reporter, as exceedingly
pleased with -the desire of -the manu-
facturers.

- PROF. DUNCAN SPEAKS.

 

S Prof. Duncan of the Department of
ave a lecture
to the students of chemistry in the
University. The lecture was held in
room 105 Thaw Hall or1'Monday, Jan-
uary 8. ‘

The subject of the lecture was:
“The Chemical Engineer and Indus-
trial Chemistry.” Speaking on this
subject Prof. Du-ncan said that all
chemical engineers should not think
of industrial chemistry. They should

ﬁrst get a good knowledge of all
chemistry in a. four-year college
course. “Then,” said he, “They can

take a course of 2 or 3 years on any
kind of chemistry andif possible to
get a doctor’s degree.” His idea in
regard to industrial chemists is this:
Let every student get the best knowl-
edge he can of chemistry. Then to
come to him and ‘be placed with a
real chemist in the research labora-
tory. Thereby the elementary knowl-
edge of the student will beneﬁt the
researching chemist and the latter in
turn will teach the student all he is
able on any problem in industrial re-
search.

It is the desire of Prof. Duncan to
have as many a.s possible of the stu-
dents to «take up the industrial work.
“Then,” says he, “we can give him a
job anda good one. The need for real
chemists is growing more intense
every day.”

The co-eds’ quarters have been re-
modeled during vacation. There’s al-
ways room for improvement every-
where. Ask the boysi-about the cold

gerty, who will appear in a short
sketch, “Love Among the Blind.”

In a short speech the prison chap-
lain ‘thanked the musical club for the
entertainment, and concluded, with the
remark that it was an undeniable fact
that performances of this kind cer-
tainly had a good inﬂuence on the in-
mates. * ‘

 

DR. ALEXANDER-SSPEAKS  

Drifting Is Topic of Address of Noted

 

Pastor.

At the last chapel exercises before

the Christmas recess Maitland Alex-
ander, D. D., pastor of the First Pres-
byterian Church of Pittsburgh, and a
member of the Board of,Trustees. of
the University, addressed the stu-
dents.

Dr. Alexander’s speech had for its
main thought drifting and its conse-
quences. He said in part: “There is

nothing more delightful, perhaps, in

this world than to drift. Many a time
I have drifted about ,in a canoe, and
how delightful it was.‘ Once I went
to sleep while drifting and ﬂoated out
to sea some distance, and when I

awoke my ideas of drifting were -not

quite so bright as when I fell asleep.

“There are three kinds ‘of drifting in
this'world, viz: Intellectual, religious
and moral drifting. And the great

- danger in each kind of "drifting is that

it is so gradual that you do not re-
alize you are drifting until you find
yourself away off from your standard
and ideal.

“What is the cure for drifting?” said .
-“The ,

Dr. Alexander in conclusion.
cure is this:‘Have the right view of

life--the view of life that is always‘-"ii

open—just stop often and think of, . all
eternity, and think about your own“
Do this, I say, '

individual eternalnlife.
and you will st-op drifting.”

GLEE CLUB. :

The Glee Club will hold a rehearsal,

every Wednesday evening at 7 P. M‘.

in Chapel until further notice. There ‘

is -much new music to learn and the
candidates must report regularly and

promptly. There is need of new ,ma- ;
terial in all parts and it is ‘hoped that;

many new candidates will report.

The manager is doing his utmost to-

get a trip east to Harrisburg, York,
Altoona, e-tc., for the week of March
25th. ‘

EMPLOYMENT BUREAU
MAKES ANNOUNCEMENT

 

Circulars Are Sent to all Students
Expecting to Apply for Positions.

 

Circulars have been sent to all the
undergraduates by the Employment
Bureau asking the students desiring
positions either during the school year
-or in vacations to ﬁll out information
cards forwarded them by the Bureau.
The desire expressed by the officials
of the bureau that the blanks would

- be ﬁlled out as speedily as possible in

order to permit the bureau to make a
systematic search for the places best
suited for the individual students.

The cards ask for a statement of
any work previously done by the ap-
plicant, the kind of employment de-
sired, the salary expected, and other
information needed by the bureau in
placing a man in a position. This
plan was adopted .at the last meeting
of the Alumni Council upon the ad-
vice of a committee appointed to in-
vestigate the subject. The officers of
the committee were A. R. Hamilton,
’94, chairman, and K. E. Davis, ’10,
secretary. The same men have been
placed at the head of the new organ-
ization owing to the carefully planned

‘ and practical report which they made

to the council. As one oﬁicial of the

' council said: "This report is the best

ever made before the Alumni Coun-
cil.”
