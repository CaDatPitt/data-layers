UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH V

 MONDAY, APRIL 13. 197.6 

by BILL GORMLEY
_ I News Editor t
In a landmark decision, the
Faculty of Arts .and Sciences
; (FAS) voted Thursday to dras-
tically revise grading proce-
.-dures in the College of Arts
—-and S_ciences (CAS):  A

The" action; which‘ followed

 three hours of spirited debate.

was taken by a, vote of 91-38. It
came. appropriately enough. at a,

 when students were diligent-
ly striving to secure good grades

for the winter term.

‘ KeyeElements
Under the new system. to be
implemented this fall. 'CAS.stu-

dents will have the option of tak- :

‘ing ‘as many courses as they want

be taken on a letter graded basis.
Also, students will be obliged to
decide within a two-week period
after the beginning of- classes
which courses Ithey willtake on
what basis. ~ V ' ,

The letter grade system ‘will be
both purified andbolstered. The
Dean _of the FAS shall step in
should any faculty members as-

sign blanket letter grades. initiat-

ing "such action as may seem ap-
propriate." Students will be re-

quired to take at least 12 credits_‘

per term on a letter grade basis
if they wish to be considered for
that term's Dean's List. 4

I Background
The document adopted by the
FAS (see text below) is a_ modi-

' Despite significant _dis.agree-

Vments among faculty members on

' the nature of an optimal grading
system, discontent withithe cur- .

rent system and its abuses has
been widespread.

“Many faculty members V feel
dissatisfaction with the useof. the?

A-E system. for a variety of rea-_.
sons." Dean Schneewind declared.
-as-he -introduced the CASC's ‘rec-
ommendations. 4 ‘ ~
Among the more salient sources

of dissatisfaction were:
1) An attitude of t'ear and re-

sentment engendered in ‘many stu-
dents by the system:

\

 :2'i_ Attempts. by some,faculty
members to "sabotage" the sys-

     F AS Revises Grading Procedures.

4) The overloading of . t h e
Dean‘s List and its devaluation as
a result of the proliferation of op-
tions available to students outside
the A-F scale.

Debate

Concerned about diff'erent as--

pects of the‘ grading system and

spurred by different attitudes to-

ward students. members of the
faculty expressed their opinions
of the CASC's plan.

Dr. JohnChapman of the Politi-

«cal-Science Department fired the

first volley. Linking incentives.
hard work. andacademic success.
he correlated a decline in "the
quality of education at the Univer-'
sity of Pittsburgh" with the pass-
age of the CASC's proposal.-

Several hundred University of
Pittsburgh students took part in last
Wednesday's Spring riot which be-
gan in the Schenley Quadrangle».

Battles with water balloons and
water pistols provided much of the
action in the quadrangle.

 

The crowd milled from the outer
to the inner quad for several hours,
’ then began to walk which ended
at Chatham College.

Students first walked over to Big-
elow Blvd. and sat in the middle of
the street, burning computer cards
? and holding them high above their
heads. ,

From there, the crowd proceeded
down Forbes Ave. to the Carnegie-
Mellon University campus, where
hundreds attempted to enter the C-
MU Student Union.

From the Union the crowd pro-
ceeded to the girls dormitories,
which were raided in customary
fashion. ,

—-The raid finally ended, with con-
siderably diminished numbers, at
Chatham.

Rites of Spring Celebrated Wednesday 

 

  

 

A group of four young law-

S. yers, working in conjunction

with Ralph Nader, has organ-
ized a national “Campaign to
Make General Motors Respon-
sible.”

Acording to Philip W.

«Moore, a staff counsel for Bus- 
inessmen for the Public Inter- I

est, and one of the engineers of
the project,‘ Corporations
have a fundamental impact on
society.”

“However, they are not at
all responsive to that public
upon which they have such
large influence,” said Moore.

According to the Washing-
ton lawyer, General Motors
has a budget bigger than any
institution in the world except
the United States and Russian
governments.

Moore said that the company
employs more people than any-
one except the federal govern-
ment, and the governments of
the states of New York and
California.

, “In short, General Motors
has the biggest day to day im-
pact on people as employees,
car buyers, and citizens,” he
said. “And it’s run by people

I ‘ »I’m sure no one ever heard of.”

The purpose of the campaign

 is to encourage proxy voters to

pass three amendments sub-
mitted by the lawyers for the
company's proxy statement.

One of the resolutions call

.- for expanding the corpora-
"tion’s board of directors from

24 to 27 members to include
three representatives of the

public.

' The second resolution pro-
posed that the company under-
take no activity which “is det-
rimental to the health, safety
or welfare of the citizens of the

H ‘ United States.”

the entire range of its activ-
ities. The committee would
then report its findings at the
1971 annual meeting.

The campaigning is concentrat-
ing its proxy fight on institu-

tions «with "General Motors‘

holdings.

According‘ to Moore, 15 per
cent of shareholders are insti-
tutions. He said that institu-
tions seem to hold a dispropor-
tionally large number of
shares.

Students have already voic-
ed their support of the amend-
ments at schools like Harvard
and Radcliffe, which have con-
siderable General Motors
stock holdings.

The University of Pittsburgh '

has invested alumni endow-
ments in approximately 15,000
shares of General Motors
stock, according to David M.
Smith, University treasurer.

General Motors has 285 mil-
lion shares of stock in all.

I The annual meeting for the
corporation is scheduled for
May 22 in Detroit.

Committee Attacks GM Practice 0rganized.By Graduates

Graduate assistants in the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences are at-
tempting to organize an interde-
partmental association of grad-

- uate students.

The organization hopes to pro-

he vide a body through which grad-
‘uate students may voice their col-

Faculty    
  Awards

Three University professors

and two teaching assistants are
recipients of a new series of Pitt ,

awards for distinguished teach-
ing. I

They are Dr. Richard W. Cot-
tam, professor of political sci-
ence; Dr. Alfred Moye. assistant
professor of chemistry: Dr. Mae
J. Smethurst. assistant professor

_,of classics; John Seidman. teach-
ing assistant in history. and Al-

bert Traunsteiner. teaching assis-
tant in German; '

They will receive the first Col-
lege Alumni Distinguished Teach-
ing Awards at a banquet for Col-
lege of Artsand Sciences alumni
to be held at 6:30 pm. Friday.
May 1. in the Sheraton Motor Inn
South. '

The awards were established
by Dr. Jerome Schneewind, Dean
of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences, and the College of Arts and
Sciences -Council. Four thousand
dollars of alumni funds were al-
located by the Dean to be used
for this purpose. The three faculty
members -will receive $1,000
each; awards to teaching assis-

- tants are worth $500each.

According to Dean Schneewind.
the awards were established. in
part. "to offset the ‘publish or
perish" principle," They are un-
usual. he says. in that such
awards at other universities nor-
mally go to faculty. but not to
teaching assistants. "I hope." he
says. "that the awards will serve
to encourage good teaching at the
undergraduate level."

The five awardees were select-

»... u

 

  

lective grievances loudly enough

_,to be heard by administrative

ears.

Len Saxe. teaching assistant
and moderator of the executive
board of the organization. outlin-
ed some of the specific problems
faced by teaching assistants.

Because of the recent Univer-
sity financial crisis, funds for the
entire teaching assistant progra
have been cut in half.

According to-Saxe. the results
of this will be increased teaching
responsibilities for graduate stu-
dents.

In addition to ther teaching re-
sponsibilities. graduate assistants
must carry at least nine course
credits. normally three courses.

I Depending on departmental
need, graduate students may be

_required to teach up to two‘

courses without assistance, a load
similar to that of some professors.

However, the -pay scale for

graduate assistants is far lower _.

C

than that of a professor. In gen».-

. eral, teaching assistants receive

$300 a month. or $1.200 a term.

Saxe pointed out that the heavy I
responsibilities of some assis-
tants has serious consequences.
for the quality of ‘education at the
University.

“Uiigergraduates especially are
being shortchanged,” said Saxe.
“That shouldbe obvious.”

Although the Graduate Student
Association of Arts and Sciences
presently deals chiefly with grad-
uate assistants. the organization
is striving to felineate issues com-

inon to all ‘students enrolled 

University graduate schools.

Saxe-noted that the majority of
graduate students are on research
grants or. more commonly. no fi-
nancial support at all.

The organization is attempting
to provide a framework through
which all graduate students may
request action on problems such
as housing, insurance, parking.
