2 Safety questioned

 Tower’s elevators slititdown forseen

Giles suggested someone be

Student vandalism and abuse
could shut down unsafe Towers‘
elevators. ’

_ __ According to F. C. Giles. super-
 §_visor of the State Department of
ii  T Elevator Inspection. there is a se-
"r curity problem in Pitt dormi-
tory elevators. and if the ma- A
chines reach the unsafe condi-
tion. inspectors will shut them
down.

“I am only interested in the
safety of the students,” Giles
said, “and I will not tolerate any
unsafe condition.”

 Pitt’s Good S(tIn(tt‘it(tnS

 

The department relayed this rec-
ommendation to the Housing Of-
fice after being called to investi-
gate the elevator situation by
the Legal Awareness Committee
(LAC).

 

- LAC is currently involved in an
incident that resulted in $3.000
damage toga Tower B elevator.

According to Mark Shiffman, a
member of LAC, state inspectors

by DALE FORDYCE
"The people were really amazing. really neat." said Jody Gerber.
University employee. and proud new owner of a rescued pup.
A stray seven month old mixed German shepherd was struck by a
car on Forbes Ave. Thursday morning. The shocked. shivering pup.-
_ bleeding profusely from paw to shoulder. ran into the bus shelter and
- ‘‘ crawled under a bench.

Gerber, on her way to work, stopped to see if she could help. The
unidentified driver of the vehicle volunteered some rags from his
* ‘ trunk and went in search of a policeman, never returning.

' When campus policeman Dick Walters arrived. he acquired a
blanket for the trembling pup. Eva Weiss. senior information clerk at
the Student Union. offered her sweater.

Pitt student Frank Sager put a cloth over the dog's mouth to pre-
vent the animal from snapping at anyone and carried the dog from un-
der the bench.

Meanwhile, Irwin Flack, an Andrew Mellon Fellow in History, was
telephoning agencies. “I called the Animal Rescue League and there
was no answer. I called the Humane Society and was informed they
" could do nothing since they don’t employ a veterinarian or have any
vehicles. There may not be a Pittsburgh branch of the ASPCA, or their
listing is obscure.”

Animal Controliwas dispatched but the members of the concern-
ed group rejected the offer of assistance. Flack explained. "They would
have killed the dog.“ ’ ‘

Sager. Flack and student Bob Fridy decided to drive the dog to a
veterinarian on Washington Blvd. The vet expressed concern for the
payment of his services. The pup had to be given shots. be x-rayed and
have his ripped and fractured leg put in a cast. Costs were estimated
at $75. _

 Sager, Fridy and Flack accepted the responsibility, but the vet
1’.-s. agreed to keep the dog only one day. ;

_ The three returned to campus where the rest of the group contri-
, buted toward the costs. Later Fridy pleaded the case before two bio-
logy classes.

J -

"The people were fantastically generous." Fridy said. “The two
 .@jclasses donated a total of $50."

__ The vet accepted his fee and Gerber volunteered to keep the dog,
.- temporarily, until a good home could be found for the pup.

"The dog will need four to eight weeks to recuperate.“ said Fridy.
"He will have to remainimmobileand needs a lot of care.“

   
 

~  However.‘Gerbcr said. “I'm going to keep him. I've named him
 "ﬂ'l‘hursday although I call him Thor for short.

“Thor isjexceedingly mobile with his cast. He’s already learned
to walk on it. In fact I’m going to borrow a playpen from mother so that
'. he will remain immobile.”

:1  ’ Commenting on the dogs future. she continued. "Thor will have to
 "have his leg x-rayed again. and the cast removed. I think those costs
I  were included in theinitialbill."

  

 The campus community has been criticized latetly for being un-
1 ,‘_..:‘_t-oncei'ned. "I tend to be a bit cynical about people." said Flack. "but
. .;everyone involved showed their will-ingness to help on Thursday. The

“small people in the community succeeded when the bureaucratic sys-

  

4

were called in to determine
whether the damage resulted
from a single incident or-a com-

bination of all the abuse the ele- I

vator has absorbed over the
years. ’

Giles explained that the depart-
ment will not allow an elevator to
operate in "bad condition. noting
that those in the Towers have
been shut down for a week in the
past.

"It seems that this type of mis-
use _is a chronic problem. at Pitt."
he said, "-and it is up to the peo-
ple in charge to find a solution."

Giles pointed out that his de-
partment can only point out defi-
ciencies while it is the owner’s
responsibility to insure safe op-
erations.

"Students should report any
abuse to the elevators if they see
itdone." he concluded. "and if it
continues. they will not have them
to use."

“Teaching quality anda con-
cern for people should be the most
important qualifications for per-
spective professors." according
to Dr. Audrey Holland, new Assis-
tant Dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences. Holland considers

, teaching and learning the most

important functions of the uni-
versity and plans to make them
the focus of her att ntion

AUDREY HOLLAND
New Assistant Dean

"The most important thing that
the university can do is teach. but
it'is not on top of the list of prior-
ities here." Holland compalined.
"When it comes to hiring new fac-
ulty members a letter of recom-
mendation from a former student
would be more valid than one from
from a colleague." she added.

“The educational concerns of
the teacher,” Holland-said, “are
not always those of the students.
Too many professors attain their
positionslwithout ever exploring
the learning and teaching pro-

I cesse's.’.’

in light of this information it is
easy to see why Holland views her.’

close elevators for safety reasons.

vowing not to accept a renewal af-
ter her.one year commitmen.t is
up. “I consider myself a teacher.
and I want to continue to be a
teacher," she said.

Holland will continue to teach
Speech 186. a undergraduate com-
munication course, this fall.

Holland expressed special" in-
terest in the new Freshman
Studies and Self-Designed Major
Programs and served on the Fac-
ulty of Arts and Science Council
when proposals for these pro-
grams were introduced. Present-
ly she is serving on the Univer-
sity Senate Student Affairs Com-
mittee.

Holland replaces Dr. Rae Sipor-
in of the English Department. who
will be serving an internship with
the American Council of Educa-
tion next year. She admitted that
her new position has been unof-
ficially designated for women.

"Dean Sehneewindjis concern-
ed with the role of women in the
sUniversity and had I not been
named to the position I'm sure
another woman would have been
chosen." she explained. A woman
was probably appointed so that
she could cover women‘s problems
and maintain balance on the staff.
she added. ‘

Holland noted that although not
actively involved in the Women's
Lib Movement at Pitt, she stands
behind them in spirit. “The Uni-

_versity still has a long way to go
on bringing women to the campus,
but women are more likely to be
placed now than five years ago,”
she remarked.

Regarding the value of a major
in Women‘s or Black Studies when
such programs do not pr_epare
students for particular occupa-
tions. Holland said that "it is not
the business. of an undergraduate
college to train people with a nar-
row interest in a professional
goal. I stand firmly behind the
concept of a liberal education. es-

pecially in the College of Arts-and

Sciences."

‘Students entering Trees Hall no-
tice a small sign in one of the of-
fice windows bearing the simple
message “Smile. God Loves You."

The office is that of Carl Rees.
currently a swimming instructor
at Pitt and an advocate of what
can best be termed active
Christianity.

“There are two kinds of’Chris-
tians in the world today,” Rees
claims, “—the man who is a
Christian because he was born a
Christian, and the Christian who
is in-the news today—who feels
compelled to practice Christian
living every day of his life.”

Rees like to think of himself as
the latter type.

“I made a personal commit-_ 

ment to Christ.“ Rees stated.
“and it has changed my life. Af-
ter all, the Bible says that you be-
come a ‘new man‘ and that you’re
reborn when you dedicate your-
self to Christ.”

While Rees himself is not di-
rectly a member of any campus
organization with religious con-
notations, he does actively parti-
cipate in many of the programs
initiated by these groups.

Most recently, Rees was involv-
ed in the planning of the Sympo-

- sium on the Jesus Movement held

earlier this month in the Student

Union. Also, Rees keeps in touch-
with such on-campus activities as

teams up  

the Fellowship of Christian Ath-_
letes and the organization which
7‘.sponsors' worship service held
each Wednesday evening at the
Bellefield Presbyterian Church.

. REES
Feels Personal Commitment
Another series of meetings.
entitled "Revolution Plus One,“
is one. of Rees‘ favorite projects
at the present. The next segment
of these meetings will be held
Aug. 22-26 at Carnegie-Mellon
University. I
Rees’ primary concern, how-

ever, is’ the Christian student at

Pitt, and how he himself, as an in-
dividual, can best relate to and
help that student.

"I find that, since I made my
personal commitment, it‘s easier
for me to relate to my students on

with God

a one—to-one basis." Rees assert-
ed. "I used to. think of my stu-

' dents merely as people who were

paying to learn how to swim. but
now I recognize them as individ-
uals created by God with individ-
ualneeds."

Rees also feels that his stu-
dents are affected to a greater or
lesser degreeby his beliefs. A
V “Obviously, I don’t preach in
class,” he grinned, “but I think
that most of my students are

aware of where I stand on the ‘

matter.”

The changes wrought by the
Jesus Movement are apparent all
over the country. according to
Rees. He sees the revival of
churches that were dying out only
a few years ago as one of the
most important of these. A

“As kids become involved in
the Movement, more and more
are returningto the churches,"

Rees said. adding that he felt the -

extreme California groups, who
resorted to practices such as
‘baptisms in the ocean‘ were just

an experimentalstage which has ‘‘

filtered out. The spirit of these
movements, however, continues
to spread. The growth of local
churches serves as evidence of
this fact."

‘Rees himself was not always so
deeply involved with Christian

living. However, a heart attack in A

1964, coupled‘ with the pressures
of his job as track coach, caused

him to reevaluate his religious be- ’ I‘ if I

liefs. »

As far as Carl Rees is concern-
ed. the decision he made has been
a very rewarding one.

Joe and Mary Poorguy live in
the projects in Homestead with

 , their two children. Last year Joe

lost his job, as his wife became ill

  while having her second child and
A A had to be hospitalized extensively,
leaving Joe to watch the other

child. Naturally, on Joe’s $1.60
per hour unskilled job, a babysit-
ter or daycare center was out of
the picture. Presently his family

* is on welfare and is just barely
-living. ' ~

Bill Smartguy is a pretty indus-
trious fellow. He is putting him-

I ' self through night school at the
University and works daily at the

hamburger stand to support his
wife and two month old baby. Bill
doesn’t, know what he would do
without food stamps or govern-

. ment subsidized medical care.

Steve Hardguy isn't the typical
everyday worker. He was respon-

_ sible for the organization of a un-

ion at _his formerly ‘non-union
place of employment. Though the

 1‘ contract left everyone fairly sat-

isfied, Steve expects trouble and
a long strike when the present
plan expires in two years; but for
now the workers are content.

Aside from all being males, you

‘might be wondering what these

three have in common. Joe, Bill,
and Steve all will lose out if the

'Family Assistance, Plan (FAP)

hungry; new clothes will become
a memory; they will be forced to
become accustomed to traveling
from cheaper and substandard
housing on down to the cruelest
corners of the ghettoes in search
of a place they can afford; medi-
cal care to them will be a pipe
dream.

FAP has been criticized for the
"loss of benefits to over 89 per
cent of current recipients. Estab-
lishing and maintaining eligibility
would require compliance with a
variety of onerous administra-

_tive requirements that are unre-

sponsive to severe human need.
In addition, many of the constitu-
tional rights won by welfare re-
cipients in the courts would’ be
circumscribed." These charges
were brought out in a critique pre-
paredvby the Center on Social Wel-
fare Policy and Law at Columbia
University.

The original rationale behind
FAP was to equalize government
benefits all over the nation and to
have them administered under
one main program. Judging by the
possible results of this thinking,
President -Nixon and his economic
advisers might have well elimin-
ated benefits entirely, especially
since the projected cost of the

lion dollars for the first year.

Since no one wanted to abolish
welfare entirely, the next best
thing was to cut it down to noth-

eventually find out if the bill is
passed.

The Poorguys would find their
income under FAP would have a
ceiling of $2,400 per year as com-
pared to the present limit of $3.
564. They could not buy food
stamps under this plan, all food
expenses would come out of the
$2,400. Government subsidized
housing would take almost a third
of their total income. Before be-
ing hospitalized for any length of
time they would have to remem-
ber that though the first 30 days
are paid for; after that the cost to
the welfare recipient is $7.50 per
day, with increases up to $1-5 per
day.

Bill Smartguy would be in big «

trouble because the bill specifical-
ly eliminates benefits “payable to

, families whose head is a student

at a college or university, regard-
less of his additional work effort
or the cost or non-cost of his ed-
ucation. A fully employed night
student at a free public college is
ineligible.”

Oddly enough, HR 1 will affect
the life of Steve Hardguy, the 10-
cal leader in organized labor. A_
pool of available workers will be

organized and trained for future

administration of HR 1 is 20 bii-,‘,.=empl0yment under FAP Aside

from several categories of exem--

'tions, practically every family

will at least have one eligible
worker. If someone refuses to
register or accept work or train-
ing, an $800 penalty is levied.

Conceivably, under the FAP plan
a worker could refuse to take a
certain job or break a picket line
and find himself losing one—third
of his annual income.

Steve Hardguy would be quite
surprised to find that his strike
for better wages. working condi-
tions. or whatever would be ren-
dered ineffective by FAP work-
ers with no other choice than to
take the job offered them. (Em-
ployers will be happy to note that
wages need be only 75 per cent of
the federal minimum. )

Naturally, the hope of the pro-
gram is to give all of the workers
jobs of some sort. That in itself
is a commendable idea—but will
it really work? Presently there is
a 6.1 per cent national unemploy-
ment rate, 10 per cent for blacks.
In addition, the results of a recent
government effort to train and
place 6,000 workers ended with
less than 200 getting jobs because
of the tight employment situation.

Nevertheless,‘ President Nixon
calls HR 1 a type of welfare "re-
form," and is trying desparately
to pass it. Ironically, a recently
televised nationwide message he
told citizens how he just tore his
heart at the “thought of an eight
year old child having to ride on
the bus to school for two hours!"

Yes, President Nixon, we all un-
derstand why this thought would
rend your heart-strings; after all,

under FAP he would be worrying .

about his empty stomach because

fare reform--ah step backward

he has no food, and shivering be-
cause he had only raggedly cloth-

. es. This might make him start to
think—and thinking is the worst
thing possible that could happen to
your constituents in an election
year.

Some people aren’t as dumb as
our politicians would make them
out to be and have organized
against HR 1. A Children’s March
for Survival on Washington, plan-
ned for Saturday, March 25, has
been organized in ten states, in-
cluding Pennsylvania. More in-
formation can be obtained by con-
tacting Jean Jones or Jean Rozier
at‘ 562-0118.

Buses are being chartered Fri-
day evening and Saturday morn-
ing to transport people to and
from Washington, D. C., with
hopes of drawing a large group of
supporters. Already 20 buses.
have been chartered from New
York with hopes for more. Local
organizers are also urging citi-
zens to write Senators Hugh Scott
and Richard Schweiker.

Unless this bill is defeated. any-
one who has been receiving any
form of government aid may be
cut off and will not have any real
recourse. Yet subsidies are still
given to farmers not- to grow
crops while people in the wealth-
iest country in the world go hun-
gry daily and stand to grow hun-
grier if HR 1 is passed.

Letters to the Editor  

Sopko Slapped

Editor:

Inspired by the letter to the edi-
tor in the Pitt News of March 15.

I am writing another review of .

Andrew J. Sopko’s reviews. I at-
tended Dr. Robert Lord’s Noon

Recital of March 7 and enjoyed‘

the program very much.

The fact that I liked the recital
and Sopko didn’t isn‘t what is im-
portant though. What is important

is that in his review Sopko made-

a very serious and cutting claim
in saying that Dr. Lord can’t play
Bach. His claim may or may not
be true, but I'm in no position to
judge and don’t feel that Sopko is
either. Dr. Lord is the Music De-
partment’s Professor of Baroque
Music and probably knows a great

"deal more about the proper inter-

pretation of Bach than Sopko
could begin to dream about at this
point in his career.

Sensational cuts were-present
in Sopko’s review of the Music
Department’s scheduled Month of
Programs of New Music as well.
I don’t like that stuff either, but

nobody cares. It will continue to_

be written and performed by the
musicians who understand it.
whether I cut it or Andy Sopko
cuts it. Furthermore, this is as it
should be, and it isn’t fair for those
of us who don’t like the music to
discourage those who haven‘t ex-
perienced it from doing so.

I feel that Sopko is using the
power of the pen a little too much
and should stop using the Pitt
News as a soap box for his un-
founded opinions. When the re-
views are good they are fine. but
bad~reviews can hurt people and
should be written with full know-
ledge, of the subject and the re-
view's possible repercussions.

Sincerely.
Elaine Desko

‘Mea Culpa

To the Editor of the_Pitt News:

We find the cartoon "To the Lith-
uanian Communist Party” inthe I

   
 



 

March 15 issue of the Pitt News
to be very poor taste. Having talk-
ed to a staff member of the Pitt
News, all blame was placed on the
old staff who published the March
15 issue as their final issue. He,
along 'with other new members of
the staff, had nothing to do with

that issue or what was trying to;

be put across. What type of new
staff do‘ we have if they take over
publication of the Pitt News with-
out knowing what the old staff had
been doing, and meant by such ar-
ticles. No member of any staff
has the right to offend a country
with such a repulsive statement,
especially the Lithuanian people
who have undergone great’ suffer-
ing and punishment in their fight
against Communism.

Presently Lithuania is not free.
Its right for freedom and sover-
eignty has been oppressed and
now a country of oldkings and
rulers of lengendary battles is no

more, or so the Russian Commun-

ists would like us to believe.

The Russian Communists have
been responsible for, the exterm-
ination of millions of people
through war, man-made famine,
deportations and executions in
torture chambers and concentra-
tion camps.

By printing such a cartoon you
have offended not only us the Lith-
uanian students but all the hun-
dreds of thousands who were ar-
tyred for Lithuania’s freedom;
Therefore an apology is demand-
ed! The staff of the Pitt News
must not ever let ‘this happen
again, not only to the Lithuanian
people but to other such countries
whose people have undergone
such treatment.

Sincerely.

Gintautas Taoras
Pittsburgh Lithuanian
Student.Association
Representative

The editors would like to apolo-
gize for the cartoon which was
placed in the advertising copy of
the March I5 lissue as a practical

joke by the departing editorial staff.

Foul Bin  

Editor :

In order to graduate in '72, I .

registered to take 19 credits in-the
spring term, i.e.. 10 credits in the
spring session and nine credits in
the summer session. I recently
received my spring invoice in-
forming me of payment due in
the amount of $350. Expecting to
pay one-half of the flat term rate
($242) I went to the Office of Stu-
dent Accounts and asked, for an

’ explanation of the billing process.

I was informed that students are

billed per credit in the spring.

term. In that case my total in-
voice for the spring term comes
to the amount of $665 as opposed
to assumed payment of $485. In
answer to my question as to why
this billing procedure differs from
the fall and winter terms I was
told "that’s the way it’s always
done." Being a transfer student, I
was not aware nor informed of
"the way.“

What makes the spring term
different? How can this Universi-
ty claim to be a non-profit organ-
ization if it freely exploits its own
students? Why wasn't I inform-
ed of this irregular procedure in

advance—I would have regis.ter— '

ed for three additional credits in
the winter term. Is such a billing
systemfair? Six credits per ses-
sion qualifies as full-time student.
Isn’t it logical that one should
only have to pay the maximum of
$242 per session?

lenge traditional literary forms-
particularly that of the conven-
tional poem. It has become an-
other form of expression. explor-
ing the verbal, physical, and vis-
ual form of a word.

Poetry no longer consists of
descriptive words arranged in a
definite rhye scheme with a set
number of lines.

These three poets have express-
ed themselves well and it is ob-
vious that they have put a great
deal of themselves into their
work. Some of_ their "poetry"
contained beautifully expressive.
emotional-lines which saved the
show.

The show opened with a lovely
poem by Peter May, entitled “On
Saying Goodby.” It spoke of _how
the narrator was always having
to say. goodbye to people with
whom he had fallen deeply in love.
Russell also composed several
pieces on a pairof kittens that
he raised. -Most of the other
works appear more suitable as
musical lyrics rather than
straight forms of expression.

The highlight of this explora-
tion of word forms was the poetic

riddle posed by May: "If the sky-

was brown and the earth was
blue, what my friend would that
make you?“ The answer? "Up-
side down." of course! ‘

What’s in a composition?

Rambling mishmash spud-telrs   

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

"The Pitt Composers Forum"
posed a number of compositional
questions in its concert at the
Trees Hall Dance Studio this past
week. and once again. the respon-
sibility of formulating suitable an-
swers fell to the listener.

After the echoes of some Schoen-
bergian wandering subsided fol-
lowing four works for flute and
bassoon (the bassoon work was
appropriately titled "Pitfall‘71" ).
we all sat back for another of
those “musical happenings."
Bruce Johnson's concept of The
Oklahoma Nature Theatre passed
before our eyes as an octet of
trombonists encircled the audi-
ence while each instrumentalist
took his place before a music
stand.

Wrapped in white sheets, the
musicians of the Indiana Univer-
sity Trombone Ensemble there-
upon poured forth the usual‘ bras-
sy belches so long associated with
their respective instrument. Fun-
ny noises from the mouthpieces,
mimickings of positionings with
no resulting sound, and the award-
ing of a potato to a member of the
audience marked the high points
of the “.composition.’.’

zi‘s Concerto for Saxophone and
Orchestra (con out—of-tune-pi-
ano). but conventionality soon
bowed to John Celona’s Multi-
phony for Cello and Electronics
with William Myers as cellist and
the composer as electronicist.

After a small technical difficul-
ty was overcome. the work got
underway as the sound of the cello
passed through a pickup running
from the instrument to various
speakers, thus amplifying the
sound and changing it. Though My-
ers is a very fine cellist. there
was really no opportunity for vir-’

tuosic fireworks here. One sensed .

a very nervous attitude on the
part of the performers, and even
a sense of bewilderment on the
part of the cellist. To date. this
is. definitely one of Celona‘s less
successful and less coherent com-
positions.

My general complaint about this
concert is due to the tenor of the

  
 
  

entire presentation. There were,
no program notes and there was}?

no attempt to verbally explain

each composer's intention. Wejj
hear so much about the public’s-W
ignorance of new music from to-’;_
day’s composers, yet here we,‘

have a blatant example of the'lax-

ity of such composers in bringing‘  
their music to the public in a sen-i ‘ 

sible manner.

I sincerely believe that the»au-

dience is quite interested in what“
the composer feels. but many.

composers insist on playing
guessing games at the audience's

expense- Practically every con-= _ .
cert of "new music" at this uni- »

Whether ‘Macha is batting cleanup for the base-
ball squad or quarterbacking his intramural foot-'

’ ball sextet to the All-CampusChampionship, he feels-

immune to pressure.
"No matter what sport I’m playing. I’d rather

have the pressure on my shoulders than on my'
’ teammate." admitted Macha. “Even when I go

bowling. I like to get the chance to wrap up_ the
game with three strikes in the last frame. '

After an adequate sophomore year at the ‘plate.
Macha experienced his fabulous ’71 bonanza. but
not before receiving some invaluable help from
Tom Beckett, an ex-Panther diamond performer.

“I felt that I had to prove myself when I was
a ‘sophomore,”. ‘Ken stated. “_I was always afraid
I’d play myself out of the lineup. 4

"Coach Lewis told me last March I'd be play-
ing. and I started off well. But then I got into a slump
midway through the year (1971). ‘If it hadn‘t been
-for Beckett. who constantly told me what I was do-
ing wrong. I don’t think I would have snapped out of
it the last two weeks. .

“Once you are in a hitting groove. that‘s great.
But you have to find someone to let you know why
you're screwing up when you‘re in a bad slump."

Grateful to the University for givingvhim the
chance to play baseball, Macha hopes that more ex.-
mitters like George Medich, now a med student at
Pitt, will be appointed to ‘the Uiiiversity Senate Ath-
letic Committee. "

"Syracuse had to cut out its baseball program
this spring." remarked Macha. "We need guys like

Medich to speak up for baseball and theyotther spring '

sports so that doesn’t happen here. ,
"I guess havingga trimester schedule doesn't

. help the spring sports. The more games we win. the '

better the chance is that more people will come out
and support us.’ People are really missing the boat
when they fail to realize how good guys like (Guy)

Cats promise .big trouble

While the Panther defensive backfield doesn‘t promise to be a bur- _

ly unit, the front seven of the defensive line will display a quantitative
amount of beef.
With the five-two defense apparently in the works again next year.
it is hoped it can help the rest of the defense with a good pass "rush.
If sheer muscle means anything. the Panthers will be in good posi-
tion to provide that rush. A .
For his two linebacking positions Carl DePasqua will have four
worthy candidates_to choose from. -
George -Feher (220),, Gary Patterson (211), new defensive arriv-
als Lou Julian (208) and John Moss (220) are joined by a healthy crew
' of freshmen backers. ’ '/
But the real weight is up front, in the five man front wall.
John Robb (250,), James Buckman‘ (244), Glen Hyde (235),
Wayne Livingston (235), Dave Jancisin (220), and Eric Knisley (200)
are all leading candidates to bolster the defensive line. ’

I On the. whole, assistant coach Ralph Jelic figures the unit averages

around 235, and some of them are not through growing.

Jeff Leston led all scorers and achieved the hat trick. Winger

Frank Williams and defenseman
Fred Wilson tallied two goals
apiece while Denny Browne, Rick
Baginski, Carl Grady, and Joe
Testa each scored once. Testa
also picked up three assists for
his night’s work.

The game wasnever close al-
though PSU did trail by only a
single goal after one period. Tes-
ta opened the scoring at the 1:20

1 mark when his slapshot from the

point beat goalie Wes Miller. It

was Testa’s third goal of the sea»

SO11.

Denny Browne put the icers.

ahead to stay with an assist from
Testa. Browne ‘took a pinpoint
pass ‘from eTesta,, who stickhan-

died from his own blue line around

the PSU‘net.
PSU could manage their only

goal at the 14:55 mark when Pitt

was two men short. Denny
Browne received a two-minute
minor for "receiving an illegal
stick” when he took a stick thrown

onto the ice by Jeff Leston after
Brownes’ had splintered. Leston
also received a two-minute minor
for "throwing his stick onto the
ice."

Browne was also assessed a 10
minute misconduct for arguing

the call too vehemently with the _

referee. I

Duane Rupp got the only goal V

for PSU as he banged a rebound

of a shot by Bob Woytowich over _

Pitt netminder Larry Toomey.

Leston picked up two of his goals
in the second period as the icers
scored three goals inthe period.
Williams also lit the red lamp for
'Pitt. .

The third period was complete-
ly dominated by Pitt as they pour-
e_d‘25 shots on the PSU net. Les-
ton, Williams, Baginski, and Gra-
dy all beat Miller for goals while
Wilson put two pucks past the
shell—shocked goalie,
