Senate to vote this week on tax increase

By Jim Luther
AP Writer

WASHINGTON —— For the
third time in six years, the Senate
is about to decide whether taxes
should be raised to reduce the
federal budget deficit.

Senate leaders hope to take a

-final vote this week on a $23 bil-

lion tax increase that is the cen-
terpiece 'of a plan to slash the
deficit by $76 billion over the
next 22 months. Spending cuts
that account for most of the sav—
ing are wrapped into a giant
money bill on which a Senate
vote also could come late in the
week. J

The framework for the anti-
deficit measures was worked out
by President Reagan and congres-
sional ' leaders in a much-
publicized effort to show that the
partisan differences can be put
aside in the national interest.

Nevertheless, there is opposi-
tion to the plan from those who
are against any tax increase and
from others who say the spend-
ing cuts are much too timid.‘

Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D—Texas,
chairman of the Finance Commit-
tee that wrote the tax bill, predict-
ed it will pass because it is ”as
painless as possible” -— meaning

the impact will hardly be felt by I

typical taxpayers. The burden
will fall almost entirely on corpor-
ations and upper-income in-
dividuals.

Sen. William Roth, R-Del., said
he probably will vote no. He
characterized the tax plan‘ as
”economic leeching,” saying
”raising taxes when we are trying
to strengthen the economy is like

bloodletting for an anemic’

patient.”

Even so, Roth said, ’’I expect
the whole thing to get through

because the president and the
leadership are behind it."

Most of the tax provisions were
approved by the committee be-
fore the Oct. 19 stock—market
crash. But_ it took the disruption
in the financial markets to coax
Reagan and congressional lead-
ers into negotiations that
produced the base of the deficit-
reducti_on plan a month later.

As part of that agreement, Rea-
gan had to drop his oft-stated op-
position to any tax increase —
just as he did in 1982 and 1984.

This year's tax bill is smaller
than either of the two earlier in-
creases. The bill passed in 1982
was estimated to cost_businesses
and individuals about $50 mil-
lion in the two years that immedi-
ately followed. The 1984
legislation had a two—year price-
tag of $27 billion.

But unlike those two earlier
bills, the 1987 tax increase has lit-

tle in it to upset the average fa-
mily. In fact, only one provision
would affect a significant number

lofindividuals; it would retain for

three more yearsthe 3—percent

tax on local and long-distance tel-

ephone service, which is due to
expire Dec. 31.

By comparison, the 1982
deficit-reduction plan imposed
tax withholding on interest and
dividends (repealed a year later);
reduced itemized deductions for
medical expenses and casualty
losses; doubled the tax on
cigarettes; tripled the telephone
tax and raised the levy on airline
tickets. ‘

Among the scores of provisions
in the 1984 law were those rais-
ing taxes on liquor, extending the
telephone tax once again, taking
away part of the benefit from in-
come averaging and limiting
commercial uses of tax—exempt
bonds. 1

need to consider.

Thomas J. La Belle, dean of

the School of Education, was .

the first to speak about the
new developments.

Pitt's School of Education
consists of three major depart-
ments: Administrative and

Education. _

’’In each case, to some
degree, the programs. have

as] cognitive studies as applied

of the Department of Adminis-

said, ”There was not a specif-
ic program that emphasized

I the study and the’nature,of

cognition.”

Student
charged
with
burglary

By William Young

Assistant News Editor

Early in the morning on Satur-
day, Dec. 5, Pitt freshman Mike
Angermeir broke into the First
Baptist Church on the corner of
Bayard and Bellefield, according
to a Pittsburgh Police report. He

was found. by the church janitor .

later that morning lying in the

middle of a pile of stained glass“

and blood.

Angermeir said he is still not
certain what happened that night
because when he broke in

‘ through the church window, he_ _

fell approximately eight feet and
was knocked unconsciousferasr

ing much of his memory of what V

happened that night.

The city police have charged
Angermeir with burglary and
criminal mischief, although An-
germeir said he was merely seek-
ing safety from a group of people
he thought werechasing him.

Angermeir claimed that after he

left the Theta Chi fraternity house

early Saturday morning, several
people approached him. He
thought they were going to mug
him, so he ran. -

Angermeir said, ”I know  ‘I
entered the church  because I
was running because I was very
scared that someone was chasing
me.” '

Angermeir also claimed that
even though he managed to get
into the church, he was still
mugged because he was missing
several personal items.

’’I was mugged, and I was run-
ning because I was really scared,

. and I tried to enter the church _by

the doors, and I couldn't. So I
broke out a window, and when’
I went in, I fell approximately
eight feet,” Angermeir said’.
Angermeir said he is not exact-
ly sure when he was mugged. ’’I

had a watch on, a sweater and a.

jeans jacket. When I woke up -
regained my consciousness in the
morning — I was missing those
three things,” he said.

The police are terming the in-
cident a ”fraternity prank” and at-
tribute it to problems with
fraternity drinking. '

All of this is a surprise to An-
germeir, who said that he isn't af-
filiated with any fraternity;

”My dad told me they [the ‘

police] called it a fraternity
prank,” Angermeir said,” which

Idon’t understand becauseI’min'- - .

Bush, Dole blast Reagan's conservative critics

PELLA, Iowa — Republican

I presidential front-runners Vice,
President George Bush and Sen.
_ Bob Dole both attacked conser-

vative opponents of the U.S.-
Soviet arms control treaty, with
Bush calling the critics ”those
noisy people.”

During a campaign stop in
Iowa, Bush said he ”couldn’t care
Iess” what the conservative ac-
tivists think about the treaty.

”I don't care what some of

V those noisy people attacking our

president think. I don't think it's
called for, I don't have any
respect for it, and I don't approve
of it,” Bush said.

Meanwhile, President Reagan
called Dole in New Hampshire
on Saturday night to thank him
for a statement decrying ”those
ridiculous personal attacks” that
’’should never have any place in
the political dialogue and certain-
ly not when directed at the presi-
dent of the United States on the
eve of the summit.” .

Reagan also thanked Dole for
a letter the senator sent Friday in
which Dole said the treaty to
eliminate intermediate—range

nuclear missiles ”is not a test of
loyalty to our party or to you, as
some have tried to portray it.”

During the conversation, Rea-
gan told Dole he understood the
Senate's reponsibility in the treaty
process and that he hoped that it
would be carried out expeditious-
ly and that senators would take a
thorough look at the treaty, White
House spokesman B.J. "Cooper
said.

The president also told Dole
that he had not been referring to
Dole or any other senator when
he spoke earlier about the treaty’s
critics, Cooper said.

In an interview on Thursday,
Reagan had said that critics of the
pact were people who had ac-
cepted ”the inevitability of war,”
prompting the conservative at-
tacks on the president.

Soviet human rights
different from ours

WASHINGTON —_ When
President Reagan and Mikhail
Gorbachev sit down to discuss
human rights concerns, they will
be on different wavelengths, say

- NEWS BRIEFS  

ASSOCIATED PRESS

observers of life in the Soviet
Union. '

”The Soviets stress the Marxist
idea of the economic man and
accept the view that man and
woman only want food, clothing
and shelter,” said Sen. Alan Cran-
ston, D-Calif. ”Our view goes far
beyond that, to spiritual, intellec-
tual and moral needs. That is a
fundamental difference between
our two societies on human
rights."

Thus, when the United States
accuses the Soviet Union of hu-
man rights violations, it points to
the estimated 300 people impri-
soned because they criticized the
government, to the thousands of
Jews who want to leave but are
denied visas and to those in labor
camps or psychiatric hospitals be-
cause of their political and reli-
gious beliefs.

The Soviets counter that U.S.
officials should not presume to

interfere in their internal affairs,
or as Gorbachev put it in a tele-
vised interview last week, ”You
should not try and go into
another man's monastery with

’ your own charter.”

CNN correspondent
roughed up by Soviets

MOSCOW — Hundreds of
burly men in civilian clothes
roughed up refusniks and jour-
nalists Sunday and knocked
down and detained U.S. TV
newsman Peter Arnett during
rival demonstrations on the eve
of the U.S.-Soviet summit.

At least 100 refusniks — Soviets
denied permission to emigrate —
planned to take part in a protest
against Soviet restrictions on
emigration.

But at least 27 were detained
en route to the Moscow demon-
stration, and the others were
overwhelmed by about 200
plainclothes KGB agents and
about 100 members of the offi-
cially supported Soviet Peace
Committee. '

Testimonies conflict in trial for racial slaying  

By Mitchell Landsberg

Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK — It is difficult to
imagine the four teenagers acting
as killers as they mingle in court-
house hallways with parents and
girlfriends, looking stiffly out of
place in their fresh, dark suits.

Special state prosecutor
Charles J. Hynes has spent the
past twofmonths trying to prove

-that the four white youths — Scott
Kern, Jon Lester and Michael Pi-
rone, all 18, and Jason Ladone,
17 — are responsible for the
death of a 23-year-old black man.

The victim, Michael Griffith,
was among three blacks who
strayed into the largely white
neighborhood of Howard Beach
last Dec. 20.

Kern and Lester are charged
with murder, manslaughter, as-

sault, riot and conspiracy; Pirone
and Ladone are charged with
manslaughter, assault and riot.

On Wednesday, a jury at the
state Supreme Court — the state's
trial-level court — is expected to
begin deliberations to select be-
tween two widely diverging ac-
counts of an incident that has
taken on the symbolic weight of
a lynching for many blacks in
New York.

The prosecution's view is that
the white youths taunted, chased
and beat the blackimen in a ra-
cial attack that culminated when
a terrified Griffith ran onto a high-
way and was struck by a car.

Then there is the defense view
— that the three black men were
up to no good when they entered
the white neighborhood; that
they were responsible for the
confrontation with the white

_ youths; that Griffith's death was

Claiminga disclaimer
makes it unharmful?

This week, the Supreme Court is hearing an interesting case.
The court is ruling on the decision of a lower court involving
Jerry Falwell, founder and ex-leader of the Moral Majority, and
Hustler publisher Larry Flynt.

In 1983 and again in 1984, Flynt’s magazine published an
ad that purported to quote Falwell describing an incestuous rela-
tionship with his mother. At the bottom of the ad, in small print,
there was a small disclaimer reading: ”..,. not to be taken
seriously.”

The ad was indeed taken seriously, and by asserting that Hus-
tler had acted with malice in an attempt to defame Fa|welI’s
character, Falwel|’s lawyers were able to win a $200,000 set-
tlement in the preacher’s favor.

There is a good bit at stake in this case. Should the Supreme
Court uphold the award and decide that Flynt overstepped his
bounds by publishing the ad, even with the disclaimer, there
could be_serious repercussions for cartoonists, columnists and
satirists. Once there is a precedent for a public figure to sue
a publisher, the fear of a litigation will surely curtail a great
portion of work. Newspapers and magazines, with the threat
of financial ruin depending on the way its satireis perceived,
might eliminate its more risky writing and cartoons. Which,
to our minds, is nothing more than simple censorship.

The important question lies in defining the bounds set by the
First Amendment, providing the rights of free speech and press.
Should the right.to express oneself freely be controlled by the
tastes and sensibilities of public figures? If such is to be the case,
how large is the jump from offending a nationally televised
preacher to offending agovernment official? ..

The possible harm of its decision is something that should
be carefully weighed by the eight sitting justices. It would seem

that the First Amendment is designed to protect the place of"

public dissent and our right to express our opinions.
It has been argued in this case that the depiction of Falwell

' in a relationship with his mother served only the purpose of

defaming and insulting him. One rarely hears, however, of a
joke that does not in some way defame or insult. And the ad
published in Hustler was certainly a joke.

If Mr. Falwell is upset, it is because he is personally offend-
ed by what was printed. However, by putting himself in the
public spotlight, he places himself in the forum of public de-
bate. Anyone who is willing to condemn vast sectors ‘of the
population to his perception of Hell, in effect to judge them
publicly, should tread lightly on the free speech of another.

In a nutshell 

Pornography is an indispensable part
of the dominant moral vocabulary. The
dirty and the clean; the loose and the
virtuous — each concept reinforces
and sustains its opposite.

At the end of each year, Jeane
Dixon, America's foremost (ah-
hem) psychic, predicts events that
are supposed to happen in the
upcoming year.

The following is a list of my
own ‘predictions, which may
have escaped her crystal ball:

0 In early .1988, Tammy Faye
Bakker will file for divorce from
husband Jim, then team up with
Jessica Hahn, Fawn Hall, and
Donna Rice to form a ’60s—style
rock group not unlike Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young. It will be
called Shredder, Un—wedder, Jim
Was Good, But Cary Was Better.

0 In late December, President
Reagan will wake up from a long
nap. He will discover his term in
office has expired and ask why
someone didn't wake him up
eight years ago. Nancy will have
gray hair.

0 The first day of spring,
University of Pittsburgh students
will begin to wonder what hap-
pened to the Frick Fine Arts foun-

Heyward loses weight? What?

FRANCES
SANSIG

tain. Someone will tell them it
was stolen. The students will be-
lieve this.

0 Sean Penn and Madonna
will reconcile their marraige and
have triplets. One of-them will
resemble a hog. He will be called
Pig Penn.

Pitt football player Craig Hey-
ward will lose 100 pounds and
join the basketball team. He and
Jerome Lane will then make an
exercise video together called
Rushin’ and ’Romein. It will be
mistaken for a documentary on
Soviet relations with the Italian
government and sell poorly.

0 City of Pittsburgh citizens
will lobby for a new law render-
ing it illegal for members of City
Council to let off steam in public

places. They will be restricted to
designated areas only.

0 Columnist Phil Musick will
be re-hired by The Pittsburh Press
then fired again after plagiarizing
an article he had previously
plagiarized. He will then be com-
missioned to write speeches for
Joe Biden.

0 Ex—Supreme Court nominee
Ginsburg will be hired as a
professor at the University of
Pittsburgh Honors College. He
will take the academic integrity of
the college to new highs.‘ ._

0 The 1988 Olympics will be
boycotted by Pat Robertson after
it is revealed they received more
donations than the 700 Club. He
will attempt to embezzle the
money, but the cash will be in-
terceptedlby Lt. Colonel Oliver
North and given to the Contras.
The Contras, in a display of good
faith, will give the money back to
the Olympic Committee and
receive free, unlimited advertis-
ing on NBC.

Practice what you preach

”None of us is free until all of
us are free.” This is a familiar sen-
timent that has been uttered by
every minority group at one time
or another. It is a beautiful state-
ment of the belief that all op-
pressed peoples must join
together,‘ to fight their oppressors,
that as ‘long as society has the
power to persecute one individu-
al, it could easily_harm a multi-
It is also,
unfortunately, not a theory that is
carried out in practice.

A specific example of this sad
situation was a statement by
Maxine Bruhns, Nationality
Rooms director, in the Tuesday,
Nov. 24, issue of The Pitt News:
”The Israeli room deals with sim-
ple concepts —— the Ten Com-
mandments, the Dead Sea Scrolls
of Isaiah — but the African room
is much grander. It deals with the
kingdoms of Africa.”

Could Ms; Bruhns think of no
other way to extol the wonders of
the African rooms than by
diminishing the value of the
Israeli room? Can black rights and

 

I.E'l'1'E.RS

the celebration of black people
and culture be achieved by no
other means than taking those
very things away from some other
minority group?

And examples of similar situa-
tions are abundant. The recent
Jeans Day, a celebration of gay
pride and gay people, was virtu-
ally ignored by everybody but
gay people, except for those shin-
ingly boorish individuals who
said, ”Yeah, I'll wear jeans when
they have a heterosexual Jeans
Day — f——-g faggots!” Live and
let live.

Can't you be confident in your
own sexuality without attempting
to crush those who enjoy an al-

_ ternative Iifestlyle?

This attitude was also obvious
at Oberlin College (notorious for
its tolerant, open-minded student
body) when the issue was_divest-

   

ment from South Africa. The stu-
dent body and all the various
minority groups banded together
to push the trustees into divest-
ing. When the issue was the
March on Washington for Lesbi-
an and Gay Rights, however,
these same minority groups re-
fused to lend their support unless
they made it clear that they were
marching for their causes, not
anyone else’s. So, while the
March demands included an end
to sexism and to exhorbitant
defense spending (supporting the
struggles of various groups), those
same groups refused to support

the March's key demand of an -

end to anti-gay discrimination.

What is this? Why are so many
black leaders anti-Semitic, ‘so
many Jews racist, so many every-
bodies homophobic? We must all
realize we are fighting the same
thing — a white, patriarchal so-
ciety — and that as long as we say
it's OK to persecute some, we are
saying it's'OK to persecute all.

Divorce
higher for
certain
couples

By Arlene Levinson

Associated Press Writer

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 4- Cou-
ples who lived together before
marrying have nearly an 80 per-
cent higher divorce rate than
those who didn't and seem to
have less regard for the institu-
tion," according to a study of
Swedish women by/‘the National
Bureau of Economic Research.

”We are not saying in any way
that cohabiting causes higher
divorce rates,” said Neil Bennett,
who teaches sociology at Yale
University and is one of the
study’s three authors. .

”What we are saying is that it
appears that people who cohabit
premaritally are less committed
‘to the institution and are more in-
clined to divorce than people
who don't live together,” Bennett
said in an interview last week
from New Haven, Conn.

He stressed that the study does
not indicate that living together
before marriage dooms a relation-
ship. The message in the survey
results, he said, is that ”whether

- or not you live together, you want ~

to have a serious partner.”

The study was based on a 1981
survey of 4,996 Swedish women,
”Women in Sweden.” Interviews
were conducted with 4,300 of
the respondents who were 20 to
44 years old and had lived with
their spouses for one month to 10
years before marriage.

Swedes were chosen because .
- they tend to precede American

social trends-by 10 to 15 years,
said co—researcher David Bloom,
an economics professor at
Columbia University in New
York. A higher proportion of

‘ Swedes cohabit before marriage,

but the practice is on the increase
in America. 1

Statistics on women were used
because no such data were kept
on men, although the findings ap-
ply to both sexes.

”The overall association be-
tween premarital cohabitation
and subsequent marital stability
"is striking,” the authors wrote in
their 26—page report for the Cam-

bridge think tank.‘ ”The dissolu- '

tion rates of women who cohabit
premaritally with their future
spouse are, on average, nearly 80
percent higher than the rates of
those who don’t.’’ 1

SEX

Q: I have been sexually active
for a while, but I have never real-

ly been satisfied because I never -

had a guy with a big enough or-
gan for me. My friend went
through the same experience,
and she has actually become
promiscuous because of it. I am
afraid ofgoing that way myself if
things don't improve.

A: I think you and your friend
have talked yourselves into some-
thing about putting all the respon-
sibility on the guys and their size.
Knowledge and skill will do more
for you than” giantism, and

knowledge and skill will be need-
ed whether the fellow is Small,
Medium, or XL. And please un-

  DR. RUTH
WESTHEIMER

derstand that you have to know
how to have an orgasm.

You are responsible for having
successful sex. It is not the man's
job to teach you — even if he
knows a lot about lovemaking,
you have to know, too. Please get
hold of the book For Yourself by

Lonnie Barbach. And urge your '

friend to read it because it shows

' a much better and safer way to go

than the way she is going now.

In this AIDS era, promiscuity is

crazy. And if_she learns the right
way to find the ecstasy she wants,
she will be less tempted to risk
her health and her life. I am seri-
ous about the dangers of AIDS to-
day. This is such an important
issue that I have prepared the
pamphlet ”Safer Sex.” To obtain
a copy, send $1 and a legal sized,
self-addressed, stamped envelope
to Dr. Ruth/Safer Sex, care of this
newspaper, P.O. Box 19709, Ir-
vine, CA 92713-9709.
T Q: My girlfriend is into a phase
of thinking she should get back
with her husband after two years
of divorce. This is partly because
of her daughter, who would be
living a more privileged life with
her father and partly out of guilt
because she thinks she never
gave that marriage what it need-
ed from her. I was living with her
for several months, but I have
moved out to give her some time
to thrash this out with herself and
her ex.

Was that the right thing for me
to do? I am really torn up over
this, and maybe being so fair and
considerate made it look as
though I were indifferent. Should
I stay away or show a little more
interest, which of course, I
genuinely feel?

A: You did the right thing, and
don't try to pressure her into com-
ing back to you unless she decid-
ed on that herself. You know
why? Because afterward she
would blame you for doing that.
I would say for you to phone her
now and then and show an in-
terest, but don't try to date her.
Let her have that time she wants.
But don't get ready to wait for her
all your life. If she goes back to
him, set about finding another
woman.

The Health Policy Institute
of Pitt's Graduate School of
Public Health conducted a
symposium for Western Penn-
sylvania hospital administra-
tors last Friday at the David
Lawrence Convention Center,
discussing the future of the tax-
exempt status of non—profit
hospitals.

Keynote, speaker, Dr.
Rosemary Stevens of the
University of Pennsylvania,
lectured on the history of
hospital taxation and the cur-

Future of tax—exempt

rent aspects of the economic
survival and quality of non-
profit hospitals.

According to speaker Doug-
las J. Hammer, vice president
of Intermountain Health Care
of Utah, ”Our hospitals under-
go an annual review by the
Utah Tax Commission so as to
verify their tax-exempt status.
This is expensive; out of pock-
et expenses for hospitals can
reach $1 million in legal fees.
That million‘ dollars could
have been spent other ways.

”The Utah tax code is quite
clear on the subject,” Ham-
mer added. ”The institution

owning the property for which
exemption is sought must es-
tablish that it is organized on
a non—profit basis. The institu-
tion’s property should be dedi-
cated to its charitable
purpose.”

”There is political pressure
to tax, to increase revenue,”
said Hammer. ”Success of
non—profit hospitals raises

questions about the legitima—'

cy of tax-exempt hospitals.
Does the hospital's total gift to
the community exceed the
value of the tax exemption?”
said Hammer. -

hospitals discussed

”What is your hospital's im-
age? Business, or a mix?
Research? In Utah, we ensure
that people who cannot afford
good health care get it,” said
Hammer. ”In states where in-
adequate health programs ex-
ist, for-profit hospitals provide
less uncompensated care.

”The debate over the Inter-
nal Revenue Service taxing of
non—profit hospitals on a na-
tional level -has been going on
in Washington D.C. for a
while,” he added. ”.This
would also apply, then, to
nursing homes as well.”

According to Angermeir, the
police attributed his memory
problems to his being severely
drunk. Angermeir disagreed and
said his memory lapse is due to
his fall.

”They made a comment, I

think, something about I was so
drunk that's why I didn't remem-
ber what happened, which isn’t I
true,” Angermeir said. ”I’ve
talked to the doctor, and he said
because of the fall I took, and I
was knocked unconscious, that is
probably the reason I couldn't
remember anything.” - '

Voila! It's lean de Florette at the Playhouse

By Michele Kiraly

Assistant Entertainment Editor

The Pittsburgh Playhouse is
presenting the city's -premier
screening of the French block-
buster film, /ean de Florette, a sto-
ry set, in the 19205, about farm
life in the country's Provencal
'region.

Based on French playwright
and filmmaker Marcel Pagnol’s
two volume epic, L’Eau des Col-
lines (The Water of the Hills), the
film is the first of a two-part story
adapted for the screen by direc-
tor Claude Berri.

The books fascinated Berri, and
soon after reading them, he an-
ticipated directing ”a grand fres-
co,” entirely cinematic.

For some, the task of adapting
a novel to the screen is easiersaid
than done; however, Berri is no
stranger to this rigorous effort. In
‘1979, he teamed up with Roman
Polanski to produce the film Tess,
which was adapted from Thomas
Hardy's 19th century novel Tess
of the d’UrberviI/es.

In 1978, Berri first came across
Pagn_ol’s work in a hotel book-
store in Morocco while working
there on another film. With a
screen version in mind, he spent
the next several years trying to ac-
quire the rights to the novel from
Pagnol’s widow; the author died
in 1974. Pagnol’s widow was

A reluctant at first to see the novel

made as a film, since it was her

and Pagnol’s favorite work».
Finally, in 1984, with the help

of a producer at Gaumont studio,

« who was also a close friend of the

Pagnol family, Berri and the stu-
dio were granted rights to the two
books of L’Eau des Collines, the

-first, lean de Florette and its se-
quel Manon des Sources (Manon

of the Spring).

The film version of both nov-
els required a nine-month shoot-
ing scheduleand a budget of $7
million, making it the most am-
bitious production in French
history. A g

ber, and in just four months, the
two films combined pulled the
highest gross of that year.

The films received France's
1986 Grand Prize of the Nation-
al Cinema Academy and received
eight Cesar (French Oscar) nomi-
nations.

Set in Provence in the
mid-1920s, lean de Florette is the
tale of Cesar Souberyan (played
with vigor by Yves Montand), the
eldest surviving member of a
once powerful family,,and his
nephew (Daniel Auteuil). The
two scheme to acquire valuable
property that was inherited by an
innocent tax collector, Jean (de
Florette) Cadoret, played by the
Marlon Brando of French Cine-
ma, Gerard Depardieu. Cadoret
not only has to face these un-
derhanders but the brutal forces

manage a farm.

It's Bruno Nuyttn’s beautiful

cinematography that makes this
film a wopderful panoramic view
of pastoral life. He captures gor-
geous landscapes with breath-
taking style and carefully records
the frustration‘ in Cadoret’s face as
he tries to irrigate his garden dur-

' ing the summer draught.

Nuyttn is remembered for his
vivid filming of Tess.

Combining fine camerawork
with Berri ’s attention to detail, the
film is an authentic depiction of
French country life. The director
had the film crew remodel the
store fronts of a small village to
look like those of the era, and he
dressed the actors in Provencal
peasant garb after the costume
designer had poured over
hundreds of photographs from

the '20s, and chose only those ac- -

tors who could adopt believable
Provencal accents.

The Pat Metheny Group per-.
formed at the Syria Mosque
last Friday, and the show is
best described as ”awesome.”
Metheny and his all-star band
entertained an avid audience
for well over two and a half
hours.

Pat and the boys marched
onto stage from different direc-
tions, each playing a different
instrument. This was unlike
any other opening that I've
ever seen. The resulting clat-
ter sounded like Babes in Toy-
land and continued for several
agonizing minutes. Metheny
assured the audience that that

was the only marching song
that he ever wrote. '

The next few songs were
very mellow instrumental
pieces. After the weird open-
ing, the audience became ad-
justed to the warmup pieces.
I've heard enough of Methe-
ny’s music before to knpw that
a much better sound was on
the way.

The marching tune opening
was Metheny’s way of saying
that he's bad enough to get
away with such weirdness. He
can then play two successive
tunes so laidback, they're
guaranteed to lull you to sleep.
He's big enough to get on
stage and do that. '

Metheny’s group, best

described as either all-star or
a gaggle of prodigies, are inter-
national and tight. There were
seven people on stage, and
with Metheny playing four
different guitars that evening,
at least 20 different sets of in-
struments were played by the
group.

The vocalists performed
well. I think customs and im-
migration would keep an eye
on them, since they didn't belt
out one note of English. Ar-
mando Marcel is from Brazil;
his partner's and his own

V background contributions ad-

ded to the surrealism of
V Metheny’s magic show.

The singers were almost re-
ligious. They alternated their

singing with trumpet and gui-
tar playing.

Each of the other band
members, Lyle Mays, Steve
Rodloy, Paul Wertico, David
Balmires and Mark Ledford,
are all accomplished artists
with distinguished track
records. Together, they hyp-
noﬁze.

The group played one beau-
tiful tune that is one of Methe-
ny’s more popular songs. I
don't know the name of it, but
it's enough to make me close
my eyes and dream myself out
of Oakland for a few minutes.

Of course, Metheny had to
play ”This Is Not America,”
sans David Bowie, let alone

Pat Metheny Group pleases with new-age jazz  

any singing in English. Basical-
ly, the singing was kind of a
Spanish wailing, only slower.

Regarding the quality of the
sound, I was impressed. The
band included a two-song en-
core that was beautiful. Why
did I ever sell my compact disc
player?

Metheny? He's good. He's
electronic. He and his band
played to their digitally
mastered potential. Local jazz
afficionados lucky enough to
catch Metheny’s and the other
recent wave of primo jazz
concerts have been wooed.by
the sheer quality of the
sounds. Many new jazz lovers
were created from these con-
certs. Are you one? '

 

   

The Proclaimers

S This Is The Story

Chrysalis Records

It's hard finding a description
that does justice to the music of
Scottish brothers Craig and
Charlie Reid, The Proclaimers.

They're sort of what you'd get-

if you cloned Billy Bragg and had
him start writing songs around
1966 or so. But they're also like
The Washington Squares without
their female singer. They could
also be The Smothers Brothers
deciding to play it straight for 40
minutes.

This is the story of a band called The Proclaimers   ,

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, December 7, i987-

But comparisons are unimpor-
tant when one considers the
depth, originality and exuberance
of The Proclaimers’ debut LP,
This Is The Story. The brothers
Reid are a powerful music force
all their own.

With only the sparest musical
accompaniment (Craig handles
miscellaneous percussion while
Charlie plays acoustic guitar), The
Proclaimers craft dynamic, catchy
songs, thanks in large part to their
vocals. The Reids effortlessly en-
gage in tight harmonies, shout
joyously behind each other’s lead
vocals and sing speedy, quirky

The album's lyrics range from
the playfully biting commentary
or ”Throw The ’R’ Away” and ’’It

counter—me|odies against each
other.

The singing is all done in their
rich, distinctive, Scottish accents,
too, adding a unique flavor to
their music. It's a flavor many
might complain about, but the
band tosses such detractors away
quickly with their album-opening
”Throw The ’R’ Away”:

I'm just going to have to learn
to hesitate/To make sure my
words on your Saxon ears don't
grate/But I wouldn’t know a sin-
gle word to say/If I flattened all
the vowels and threw the ’R’

Broke My Heart” to more per-
sonal explorations in ’’Letter
From America” and ”The Joyful
Kilmarnock Blues.” The Reids
also handle love songs well.

-Thelsimplicity of ”Make My
Heart Fly” is a winning one, and
their inspired cover of'Lester
Blackwell's ’‘’(I’m Gonna) Burn
Your Playhouse Down” i

   

away.

with ”The Part That Really Mat- '

ters,” a tuneful high point on the
record.

This Is The Story is an original,‘ ;
engaging debut by an act with the. '

potential to put a much-needed
dent In the slick, pop-music struc-
ture, The Proclaimers make intel-
ligent lyrics fun, bare-bones folk

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, December 7, T987

 

Introducing Buster Poindexter.
It's hard not to be impressed by
‘his slightly pressed tuxedo and
perfectly coiffed pompadour. But
the clincher is Buster's voice;
gravelly, authentic and confident,

I , it reeks of martinis and Marl-

boros, and more importantly, of
expenence.

As he talks, one can understand
why, since his first appearance
three years ago at a little club in
New York City called Tramps,

- Buster has become one of the

most popular nightclub draws in
Manhattan. Saturday Night Live
liked his nightclub act so much
that he made several appearances
on the show last year and is
scheduled to do so again this
yean

In this interview, Buster ex-
plains how he got his big break
and why he and David Johansen
(founder of the New York Dolls)
are never seen in the same room.

Q: Your shows in New York
have made you a city celebrity.
Do you think the rest of the world
is ready for Buster Poindexter?

A: There's a lot of people out

there that’ve been through the
rock thing, the heavy metal youth
rallies  that are looking for en-
tertainment. I’m an entertainer,
and I want to make them happy.

Q: How do you keep yourself
happy when you're not enter-
taining?

A: With booze, broads and
balmy nights. And bongo drums.
I like the ”B” thing. I'm a denizen
of the night, you know, although
I occasionally like to flop out.

Q: What sort of people do you
socialize with?

A: Gamblers, authors, film-
makers, thieves  all kinds of
people. I got a well—rounded,
Runyonesque interest in life. I go
to a lot of shows because my
friends like me to be at their
openings and stuff. But I don't go
to discos or clubs. That's like
when the bus driver has to take
his family on a driving excursion
on Sunday.

Q: What about during the day?

A: I like to spend the afternoon
at the track with my cronies and
get a little sunshine, have a cou-
ple of drinks, go back in town

and hook up with some babes to
go out to dinner with. Then, af-
ter a show, if the night's still
young, hit a saloon for some live-
ly conversation. Drink a martini.

Q: Is that your favorite drink?

A: Yeah, a Bombay martini.
And amaretto, of course.

Q: Where did your big break
come?

A: Well, I first started singing at
a little club on 15th Street called
Tramps. I wanted to do some
R&B stuff with a little jazz thrown
in with my friend Joe Delia. So
the first night I'm gonna go on, I
told my friend, Tony Machine, I
didn't want him to drum with me.

I said, ”We don't want drums
to clutter up the stage.” I got to
the place that night, and there
was Tony, all set up with his
drums. He knew I wasn't gonna
make a scene, so he was in the
band.

Q: Was that the beginning of
His Banshees of Blue?

A: Yeah. It was a gradual thing.
Brian Koonin came after that.
He's multi-instrumental. He plays
balalaika for the Dance Troop of

plays stand—up rock and jazz
bass. He's one of the best.

Then I met Soozie Tyrell doing
a workshop. I really enjoyed sing-
ing with her. So that's where the
roots began. And when we
moved to the Bottom Line two
years ago, we added our percus-
sionist, Fred Wolcott, and we got
the Uptown Horns to join in; let's
see, that's Fred Wolcott, Bob
Funk, Hollywood Paul Literal,
Crispin Cioe and Arno Hecht.

Q: What about your child-
hood? , A '

A: I was born the only child of
Beauregard and Beulah Poindex-
ter in Bogalossa, La. My parents
were a song-and-dance team,
kind of a postvaudeville/min-
strelesque type of thing. They
used to travel all over the South,
and I traveled withithem. I was
practically born in the trunk.

Q: So you grew up in the
South?

A: No, when I was six, my
father was tragically murdered in
a bridge game; he got caught
cheating. The culprit was this

’ guy, Big Chief Boo Don Wah,

who used to do the Indian medi-
cine man's specialty number in
the show.

So when Beulah read in Varie-
ty that Tallulah Bankhead was
looking for an aide-de-camp, she
got the job, and we moved to
New York; hence, my accent and
stuff. I grew up in the maid’s
quarters of Tallulah Bunkhead’s
house on Park Avenue.

Q: Is there any truth to the
rumor that you are, in fact, David
/ohansen, the man who founded
the New York Dolls?

A: People are always saying
they never see me and David in
the same room. But have you
ever seen Lou Reed and Janis Ian
in the same room? Nah, the truth
is, I feel sorry for the guy, so I let
him write a couple of songs for
me on my album.

He did, ”Hearts of Gold” and
”Cannibal” with Joe Delia. I
figured, he has to do something
’cause he's such a bitter man
since his career didn't work out.
These days, he stays home and
reads his book on Stanislavski,
and that's about it.

You know when he first start-
ed, he told me he had an appren-
ticeship with Charles Ludlum’s
Ridiculous Theater. He was like
a spear‘ carrier or something.
Then he did that whole Dolls
thing, which I'm told was rather
notorious. ‘

I got to know him better after

Pink Floyd is able to stay afloat without Waters 

Here?” ,”Money?” David Gil-
mour wrote and sang all of these,
and if one of these songs isn't
your favorite, one that he did
write and sing probably is.
After listening to their latest al-
bum, M_omentary Lapse of Rea-

son, it is obvious where the talent

was in this band all along. Forget '

Roger Waters. He wasn't a very
good bass player, and every time
you hear him sing, you want to
run for the razor blades so you
can slit your wrists.

His concept album ideas were
good, but everything he writes or
sings is so depressing. This new
Floyd album is not depressing in
the least, and is still, even without
being a concept album and even
without Waters, very much Pink

Gilmour wrote songs for this al-

bum that have some strong social

statements. ”One Slip” is about
the differences between love and
lust. In ”The Turn Away,” he

  

writes of the plight of the home- A A

It's hard to imagine a record
more doomed for obscurity
than this one made up of a 14-

the song lengths aren't enough
to scare away radio program-

sic of this much-maligned

T Fela’s inspiring music

shouts between Fela and his
Egypt 80 singers and the
detailed, disarmingly personal
lyrics (particularly on ”Look
And Laugh”) are probably not
readily digestible to the
listener raised on big, obvious,
pop-song hooks but are,
nonetheless, well worth dis-
coveﬁng.

After all that I've read about
Fela’s inspired activism against
his country's government and
the energy of his perfor-
mances, I had hoped this
record might burn with a more
intense ﬁre; I guess a live show
is the best indication of Fela’s
talents. But there is, nonethe-
less, something unique and
noteworthy captured on

hattan, what's next?

A: Well, six or eight appear-
ances on Saturday Night Live this
year. I'll do some more albums,
but right now, I'm dying to take
the show around the world. With
the album out, we can take the
show around to some nice
rooms. You know, the kind
where your feet don't stick to the
floor. I want to show people in
the Midwest, the South, even Eu-
rope, the time of their lives.

Q: What would be the ultimate
challenge for you?

A: There is no challenge. What
I do comes easy to me. It's like
falling off a log. I mean, I don't
want to go to the moon or any-
thing. I'm there half the time as

it is.

THE P|Tl' NEWS

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

Before a capacity crowd at the
University of Illinois last Thurs-
day evening, the. Pitt women's
volleyball team put up a valiant
effort before losing to the Lady Il-
lini in.an opening-round match of
the NCAA tournament.

After winning the first game

15-5, the Lady Panthers were

defeated in three successive

games by the score of 4-1 5, 3-15.

and 2-15.

Commenting on his team's per-
formance, Pitt coach Shelton Col-
lier said, ”We won the first game
by playing extremely well. We
had 18 kills whilecommitting no
errors, which is incredible. Our
players were tactically ready to
play, -and they used some great
strategies in winning the game.”

”Illinois was able to win the
next three games, but the match

Lady Panthers fall
short in bid to upset
Lady Lions of PSU

By Matt Martin
Staff Writer

One-basket losses are nothing
new to Lady Panthers head coach
Kirk Bruce. His three-year career
at Pitt has been littered with
heartbreaking one— or two— point
games.

But Saturday night's 73-71 loss
to the Penn State Lady Lions must
have been harder for Bruce to
swallow than any game before,
for his new-look Lady- Panthers
proved that they are not like the
Pitt teams of old.

The Lady Panthers placed three
players in double figures and
held All-America point guard
Suzie McConnell to a season low
of 14 points. The game was not
decided until Lions’ sophomore
fon/vard Tiffany Chill hit a 10-foot
jumper with seven seconds re-
maining to produce the final
score.

Pitt junior forward Deidra Bak-
er put up a last second shot, but

it bounced harmlessly off the rim .

as time expired.

”We can't blame this loss on
Deidra,” Bruce said. ”The team
lost the game.” Bruce blamed the
loss on the rebounding depart-
ment, which Penn State led
49-40. ”The rebounding was ter-
rible —- we weren't boxing out,”
he said.’ The Lady Lions, on the
other hand, battled inside and
consistently got two or three

chances off the offensive boards. -

But overall, Bruce was pleased
with his team's performance.
”The people who were here
tonight saw a lot better basketball
team than they've seen in a long
time,” Bruce commented. ”I
guarantee we will play_like this
every night from now on.”

The crowd of 1,369 witnessed

Steelers

By Thomas Danyluk

A Staff Writer

”We thought [Seattle] would
be a lot tougher against the run.
We thought they'd tighten up af-
ter what Bo Jackson did to them
last week.”

Well, Walter Abercrombie,
you and your Pittsburgh Steeler
teammates were, for your sake,
quite wrong. The Seattle Sea-
hawks didn't tighten up their run
defense, even if they tried, but

the game at the Fitzgerald Field
House, which was the Lady Pan-
thers’ first home game of the year.

Pitt senior forward Sally Sheer-
er epitomized the Panther cause,
scoring a game high 20 points, in-
cluding going three for three on
3-point shots, and pulling down
15 rebounds, also a game high.

”Nothing Sally does amazes
me anymore,” Bruce said of
Sheerer. ”I expect games like this
from her, and Sally wanted this
one really bad.”

”I just wanted to beat Penn
State,” Sheerer said of her perfor-
mance. ”There’s been a rivalry
between Suzie [McConnell] and

I since we played in the Junior '

Olympics. She's the best point

guard I've ever played against

here,” Sheerer said.
McConnell, a two time All-

"American from Seton LaSa|le

High School who has led the na-
tion in assists for the« past two
years, ended the night with just
14 points, 10 under her season
average. But she made up for her

' ”low” point output by dishing

out nine assists and collecting six
rebounds.

McConnell also pestered the
Pitt guards all night, coming up-
with several big steals in the se-
cond half. ”I shouldn't say this
about a college player, but Suzie
is a money player,” Bruce said.
”She plays better when the pres-
sure is on.”

McConnell’s teammates also
came through under pressure, as
three other Lady Lions placed in
double figures. Senior forward
Bethany Collins and sophomore
Chill each scored 12 points, and
Collins also hauled in 10 re-
bounds. Freshman Tanya Garner,
a West Mifflin High School
product recruited by Pitt, scored

run Seattle into

one thing their 13-9 loss to the
Steelers did tighten up was the al-
ready bizarre Xmas rush to the
playoffs. Now everybody and
their bruh-ther are scrapping for
at least one of those two precious
wild-card spots.

A week ago today, the Los An-
geles Raiders rushed for over 300
yards in a surprising 37-14 thrash-
ing of the".Hawks. Rookie sensa-
tion Bo Jackson blew through the
once—thought-to-be-stingy Seattle

' defense for 221 yards of his own, -

was closer and more competitive
than the scores -indicate. The
team hung in there and played
extremely well,” he added.

Perhaps the turning point in the
match occurred in the second
game with Illinois, up by a score
of 7-2. It was at that time the Lady
Panthers and the Lady lllini went
through 12 service rotations be-
fore Illinois broke through for the
point. ’’If we had been able to
score a few points there, it might

have made for a real tight game,”
noted Collier.

More than anything, the eighth-
ranked Lady lllini started really
asserting themselves in the se-
cond, third and fourth games.
Collier observed, ”We tried to
key our block and defense to stop
[Illinois All-America middle-
blockers] Mary Eggers and Nan-
cy Brookhart, but after the first
game, we were unable to do so.”

Class, that is something the

1987 Lady Panthers have showed 1,

from day one. With the Big East
champion not assurred an NCAA
tournament berth, the Lady Pan-
thers roared to a 37-5 record dur-
ing the regular season. At one

point, they won 25 matches in ‘

succession, with wins over na-

tionally respected teams such as"

Florida, Houston, Ohio State and
Penn. State. Their loss to a poten-
tial Final Four team [Illinois],
should not cast a pall over their
season.

16 points.

But the Lady Panthers also had
their share of offensive stars.
Deidra Baker ended the night
with 12 points on some NBA—like
moves and junior point guard

Denise Becher chipped in 12

a Raider club record.

The Seahawks, understanda-
bly, planned on venting their frus-
trations on this week's opponent,
which happened to be the Steel-
ers. But Chuck Nol|’s bunch
wasn't too keen on being Seat-
tle’s body bag.

”The talk all week was about
Seattle being an angry team.
Well, I think we were an angry
team comingin,” said Steeler
center Mike Webster, whose

team‘ h'srd- lost'two'of‘its’:last three‘ 1

contests and felt playoff hopes
slowly dying.

Yet, the Steeler coaches were '
able to exploit Seattle's vitamin
”D” deficiency and turned Aber-

‘crombie, fullback Frank Pollard

and the rest of the Pittsburgh
rushing attack loose for 209
yards’. And ChuckiNo|l was ec-
static, at least as much as his low-
low-key demeanor could allow,-
over the outcome. «.

in here.”

Yet, he continued, ’’I can't say
enough about the effort of our
players. Pollard probably

epitomized the whole feeling our-

team had today on the field with
his performance,” said Noll. ”He
didn't talk about it. He just went

out and did it on the field. They '_

all did.”

Pollard rushed for 106 yards-E
and a touchdown on 22 carries.

been one to get itself into close
ballgames, that is, non-strike ball-
games. When it wins, it wins big
(43-14 over Kansas City, 35-13
over the Raiders, 37-14 over
Detroit, etc.). When it loses, it
goes down pretty hard (30-14 to
the Jets, that Monday night blast-
ing by the Raiders, etc.). Cock-
fights are something the
Seahawks just aren't accustomed
to.

Coming into playoff-hungry
Pittsburgh, that's exactly what
they got.

”lt’s been a while since we've
been in the hunt,” said Steeler
quarterback Mark Malone (11 of

18, 99 yards passing). ”We want- J

ed this win pretty bad.  We
haven't given up on ourselves.”
Pittsburgh's win, paired with
the Cleveland Browns’ 9-7 loss to
the Jndianapolis Colts, twisted
AFC Central into a three-way tie
for first place. Pittsburgh,
Cleveland and Houston all have
7-5 records with three games re-
maining. The Steelers must face
both Houston and Cleveland, as
well as slumping San Diego.

 

In a game with everything but
offensive explosiveness, the
Steelers called nine consecutive
running plays after taking the
opening kickoff and drove 65
yards to set up a 37-yard Gary
Anderson field goal.

Seattle answered with 11 rush-
ing plays of its own on the ensu-
ing drive, and Norm Johnson
booted a 33-yard field goal at-
tempt through the uprights to
knot the score 3-3.

In the second quarter, the Sea-
hawks pieced together a 12-play,
65-yard drive that ended in quar-
terback Dave Krieg’s 12-yard
touchdown toss to Steve Largent.
Largent, drawing‘ one-on-one
coverage by Steeler cornerback
Dwayne Wood ruff, made a move
to get behind the defender then
used some fancy footwork and
the instant replay to keep himself
in-bounds after snaring Krieg’s
slightly overthrown aerial.

Holder Jeff Kemp bobbled the
snap on the extra point then
lobbed a desperation pass into
the end zone, which was picked
off by Pittsburgh rookie corner-

   

back Delton Hall. That foul-up
would eventually haunt the
’Hawks late in the game, as Seat-
tle led 9-3.

Another Anderson field goal
just before the half cut Seattle's
lead to 9-6.

Late in the third quarter, Pitts-
burgh displayed perhaps its best
drive of the season, marching 81
yards in 14 plays and eating 7:23
off the game clock. Malone was
a perfect 4 for 4, including a cru-
cial 8-yard shot to running back
Rodney Carter on third-and-six.

Then on the first play of the fourth A
quarter, Pollard b|ew'14 yards up '

the middle and dove into end
zone for the final points of the
ballgame and a 13-9 Steeler lead.

Seattle drove to the Steeler 37,
but on fourth-and—14, Krieg and
his offense were forced to go for
the homerun ball instead of the
field goal (remember that extra
point?). Needless to say, Hall

broke up the pass, and the Sea-‘

hawks ‘were sunk.

And now back to back to the
AFC Central race: Boy, it's getting
hot in there.

three assists.

The loss dropped Pitt to 2-2 on
the year, while Penn State
climbed to 3-1. Despite the set-
back, the Lady Panthers still feel
this could be their year. ’’I’m still
looking forward to a good sea-
son,” Sheerer said. ”The first
thing Coach [Bruce] told us in the
locker room was to forget about
this game.”

”We have a legitimate shot at
winning the Big East title this year
and I think we will,” Sheerer con-
tinued. '

Panthers
set to
face CS U

The Pitt basketball team
(2-0) will host Chicago State
2-2 tonight at Fitzgerald Field
House. Game time is 8. ’

The Panthers defeated
Chicago State, 112-70, at Fitz-
gerald last year.

Pitt coach Paul Evans will go
with the same lineup he's used
in the first two games. Pat
Cavanaugh and‘ Jason Mat-
thews will start as the guards,
Demetreus Gore and Jerome
Lane will start as forwards, and
Charles Smith will start at
center.

Smith sprained his ankle
against St. Francis last Wed-
nesday night but will play
tonight. Gore is still not fully
recovered from an ankle
injury. '

Smith is Pitt's leading scorer
through two games, averaging
21 points per game. Lane is
the team's leading rebounder
at 12 boards per game, while
Smith is averaging 11.5.

. Pitt‘ coach Paul Evans said
he doesn't expect a letdown
from his team tonight. ”l don't
really think looking ahead will
be a problem. There are too
many young kids on this team
for that to happen.”

Chicago State's top player is
7-foot, 225—pound junior
center Laurent Crawford, who
is the biggest player Pitt-has
faced this year.
