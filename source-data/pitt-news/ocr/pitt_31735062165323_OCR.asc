Academic Freedoms”

By ESTHER IVIISHELEVICI-I
University of Pittsburgh professors have come out in
favor of censuring administrations of seven universities that
dismissed professors for using the ﬁfth amendment or be-

longing to the Communist Party. They took this action at '

the recent meeting of the American Association ‘of University

If

Profes_sors.

At the same time, they voted to reaffirm the ’AAUP’s
principles regarding academic freedom and tenure. Dr. Don-
ald L. Cleland attended this meeting as oﬂicial delegate from

the local chapter of the AAUP.

_He was accompanied by three

other members of the Pitt facultyﬁ

William Schulz, Dr.
and Mr.

professor
A Dunkelberger,
William S. Tracey.

, -Pitt Supports AAUP

Acting Chancellor Dr. Charles
B. Nutting stated concerning these
issues, “The University hasvno at-
titude towardthe censure of the
other universities. That is none
of our business. As for the
AAUP’As principles, Pitt’s admini-
stration has always supported
them and will continue to’ do so."

  The student‘ elections are over, but party politicking
and manueveringiwillbe stepped up during thenext few

weeks. - ’

V A lot of attention will be focused on Men’s Council, where

the Panther Party gained a one-vote edge onA thelndepen-‘

dents.

Although the Panthers-grAabbedA-eachAAof the six class pres-

idencies in Business Adm_inistra—%

tion and the College, in addition
to 16. of the 43 available class ofﬁce
seats, scoring a strong. victory,
they are still concerned about
their chances of determining who
will be the new Men’s Council
president.
Revision Important

One of the biggest factors in-
volved. in the Panther Pa1'ty’s un-
easiness is a revision in the MC
Constitution which ‘eliminates the
requirement of having the class
president serve; as the Council
representative. The class ofﬁcers

are now expected to select a rep-,

resentative
selves.
Dimitri Petro, chairman of the
Elections Committee, said last,‘
week that the class officers were
supposed. to have selected their
MC representatives by last Fri-
day, but that “more than likely,”
they won’t decide until this
week.

The revision, which was ‘sanc-
tioned by the current class offi-
cers, was instituted because it was
thought that it would permit
Council to get better representa-
tion from the class offices.

14 Vote-s Assured

Under the ‘old setup, the Pan-
thers would have been assured of
14 votes in Council——seven at-

, Amendments to WA GA by-laws

According to the eleven priln-A‘
ciples the professors reaffirmed,
a professor may be fired only if
he. is proved unfit to teach be-
cause of “incompetence, lack of

scholarly objectivity or integrity, A g — '

serious misuse of the classroom

or of academic prestige, or con-' A ‘

scious participation in conspir-
acy against the government.”
A teacher may not be ﬁred for

invoking the ﬁfth amendment or - '

belonging to the Communist Party
alone. He is entitled to a fair
hearing, judgment by his aca-

demic peers, and a decision based f

on evidence action’ is

taken.

before

Principles Adopted
These principles are not new,
Mr. Tacey explained. In 1940,

the Association adopted a State- . A ‘

ment of Principles on Academii:
Freedom and Tenure, regarding

civil liberties and- tenure righ1.s._

Recently-, however, because of
much government investigation
and because of" the adoption of
disclaimer oaths in some states,
many faculty members have ‘been
dismissed. , '-
A special eight-man commit-
tee of the AAUP examined ‘eight’
speciﬁc schools in regard to such
cases and decided that the As-
sodiation ought to readopt their
original - principles, making Athem
more compact. _ A " I ,
Temple Forgiven ~ -
Administrations of eight schools
were then recommended for cen-
sure in connection ‘with these
principles. They were the Uni-
versity of, California, Ohio State,
Rutgers, Temple, Oklahoma, St.
Louis University, North Dakota
Agricultural College, and Phila-

,delphiaiJefferson Medical College. I

Pitt favored censuring only seven
of. these, voting that
shouldn’t be blacklisted. All eight
were censured.

As far as Temple was concern-

ed, Dr. Tacy said, their admini- =

stration,need not have been cen-

sured, had they rehired one of the‘

teachers they dismissed after the
United States Court .found him

innocent and changed their ten-

ure policy. .
_ An administration can be re-
moved’ from the censure list. by

giving its teachers permanentor '

continuous ten_ure.

Festival Plans Reach
Final Planning Stage

By ED BACHMAN

From outward appearances, there is a lull in 1956 Spring
Festival plans. But in reality, the behind-the-scenes action is
hitting a fast pace, withjust three Weeks to go.

The kickoff of the Week will be the annual sweepstakes
races, on Monday, May 7, this year called the “Thames Tour-
ney.” This race, featuring the male sex, will have competi-

tion this year from the coeds,

their own, called the “Kiddie Kare

Race.”
Deadline Extended

Another innovation for the ’56 ,

Festival is a contest called the
“Best Song of the 1956 Spring
Olympics.” This will be open to
any group or individuals. The
deadline for entrance to this con-
test has been extended to April
27 and entries may be submitted
to Alice. Turley in the Dean of
Men’s ofﬁce.

Each song should in some
way pertain to the theme of the
week and should contain origi-
nal words, although the music
may be borrowed from outside
sources.

The three best songs will be
chosen and will be played daily
in the Tuck Shops during Festival
Week. The top song will then be
chosen at the Spring Festival Ball,
on May 12. -

8 Shows Scheduled
. Highlight of Festival Week is
always the Carnival shows, and
this year should prove no excep-
tion. Eight fraternity and sorority

~ shows are scheduledthis year on

take-offs of Shakespearean plays.
The shows will run Tuesda
thorugh Friday, May 8-11. ‘

‘Concluding the week will be

' . the ball, this year called ,“Capu-

. let’s Capers.” The Hilltoppers,
nationally-known quartette, will
/be _the featured vocal group. In
addition, _T9mmy Carlyn will
‘conduct Buddy Lee’s Orchestra.
"Tommy Turk’s Band will share
"the bandstand, with Carlyn.
_Turk, who plays often’ at the
Point View Hotel, features jazz
music_-in his repertoire.

All awards of the Week will be
presented at intermission of the
ball. In addition to the awards,
the Festival Queen, “Miss Juliet,”
will be crowned.

Tickets are now on sale for the
Ball at the Student Desk. Price,
per couple, is $3.75, but if pur-
chased at the Syria Mosque, where?

Seniors Tested

In Three Fields

Graduate Record Examinations
for seniors in the College will
start tomorrow. The tests are
given to provide a comprehensive
appraisal of a college student’s
achievement in the Social’ Sci-
ences, Humanities, and Natural
Sciences. -

They are scheduled for Tues-
day, Wednesday, and Thursday of
this week, according to Stanton
W. Crawford, dean of the College.

~A limited number of appoint-
ments may be transferred from
one of these sessions to another,

in advance with the University
Testing Service, 1623 C1. Attend-
ance at these examinations is
considered a legitimate excuse for
absence from classes. ~

Results of these examinations
have several uses: they enable
each student to evaluate himself
in relation to a large population
of seniors graduating from the
nation’s outstanding colleges; they
may be used as evidence or
a_chievement'in support of an ap-
plication for admission to various
graduate schools; and they ..per—
mit the University to evaluate it-
self in relation to other colleges
and universities. 4

Works . . .

A “learning by doing" philosophy is basic at’
Kearfott. As an assistant Project Engineer,
you are given assignments in several
engineering laboratories to determine in
which you can make your best contributions
and ﬁnd your greatest satisfaction. Under the
guidance of senior engineers and specialists,
each man takes his project thrtfugh from
inception to final production, thus acquiring
a broad eoqperience background. Success
depends on individual initiative and

‘ resourcefulness.

_' THE SPECTATOR(SlV—-At the climaxing moment of
iucoronafion last year——*lhe crowning of the Senior
Queen-—Owl Photo Editor Tom Vrana snapped this pho-
tograph from the Commons Room Balcony. showing
how’ really interested the women and spectators are
, in the ceremony.

A , Sacrasanct’ Tradition

Not _too long ago, the English room was dedicated in
this University; recently we learned that the Haileybury
Players will present ‘.‘Macbeth” in the Commons Room and _
, ﬁnd its atmosphere idea_l for the Shakespearean tragedy. But

, neither of these is exceptional considering that we have
copied the British Coronation for years as a high climax to
the woman’sﬁactivity program at this University. . 
' Now weappreciate the English Room for the tribute it
pays to 'a great heritage; and we have realized for a~long
time that the Commons Room has intrinsic val_ues——ever
since dances were permitted after years of prohibition. But,
after watching it, we are only repelled by the guady ex-,
hibition of childish parading which women have known for
‘many years as .f‘Coronation.” . ‘
/ Although the climax of women’s programming for
/the year is the naming of “Senior Queen” on‘ Tap Day,

7 the women haveextended their honors to the day be-,
fore Graduati 11 when Coronation is held. Urged on by
the Dean of omen’s Office which long has held tradi-
tion sacrasanct, the wornenyhave maintained more for
‘sentimental reasons than for academic or activity value
these gaudy ceremonies. A / ,

On the particular occasion, they surround a “symbolic”
queen with symbolic herbstrewers,"canopy--bearers, guards,
peers, and servants to prove outloud that such qualities as‘
virtue, mercy, and queenly bearing are qualities that the
graduating senior should possess. In most cases, they need
not convince us with so expensive a ceremony. '

From a quick glance at the picture abov_e, it doesn’t ap-
pear that too many of the participants or the audience are
convinced themselves. _ _ f , ,‘ \ _

' A woman graduating from a major University should -
know how to_‘,_'dre'ss smartly and properly; Coronation" doesn’t
agree with this ‘i'dea;"'it employs royal vestments. She should
know to think for herself. Coronation also denies this right,
for the parts the woman recite and the motions through
which they are led are the same that women have been re-
citing since the program first took effect—probably due to

- some.English student’s unfounded infatuation with Victor-
ian glamour, _ _ _ .  __ . __ .
’ A No or’lg'_inal_fthinking‘goeS .into__Ithe cere1"1iony._ No _at- ,

. graduation‘ ~‘is' made‘--just parties, and "teas",-.fanc‘y pro-
grams, and,‘at%t‘he'introductory session, roses‘ imbedded
in ice. ~ -‘ ' .
,_ To give-the whole affair an air of authenticity, the Pitt
_Queen is required to take an oath over the Bible; for_ so
fabricated a-program, it seems almost sacreligious. As ’far

‘ as we’re concerned, ‘such religious ceremonial ina secular

’ University should be out of the question, and certainlyout
of Coronation.

Valuable student funds are now being used toward the
improvement of a practical student union. The sooner Coro-
nation funds are transferred, the better it will be. For, while

. ‘the studentunion may provide discussion and conference

areas for informal get-togethers and the opportunity for
academic satisfaction, Coronation proves the womenmere
followers, who can" memorize those lines that have been
memorized since years past, allowing no quarter for women
to show that they too-, are thinking, intellectual individuals. _

Because Coronation is not in character with—the. aca-
demic progress of this University, this ‘year ‘should be its -

 it ifdslerérz Refugees» Pose Problem

Germany Improved

 

V By mv JACOBS ‘ ,,

A tall, blonde, athletic-looking gentleman from ‘Germany
spoke enthusiastically in German of his pet project, corre-
lation of religion with organized labor. 0

Here in Pittsburgh last week as part of the state depart-
ment’s program of exchange of foreign leaders, the Reverend

John Franke of
Steinheim, Ger-
many, was in-
terested in
meeting “Ger-
man - speaking”
American re-

with the same
interest. .

He spoke of
vigorous ad-
vances in post-
war Germany.
Germans, with much the same
industry, technical interests, and
resources as Americans, have much
in common.

German leaders are constantly
alert to the need to offset the
effect of the intense Communist
propaganda machine in nearby

Frank

East Germany. One of Germany’s

chief problems today is the read-
justment of East German refugees
who have ﬂed to the freedom of
the West, but who,lnonetheless,
show mild leftist tendencies as a

~'"“T":i"esuft of prolonged eposure to

Communism.

As to any fears of Germany’s
ever designing again to world
conquest, there is no such in-*
tent today. “Germans have
learned by experience that one
gets poor, not rich, through war
I-—-in"‘both the loss of friendships

V and gnrioney,” he observed. Since
World War II, Germans have

‘to tIu'n]<...1ess ‘

Brother, when I think of those
lonely nights I used to spend.
‘When I think of the scam and

aid, now desire strongly to be
our ally.
Though there is now no ques-

tion about allied relations, the
Reverend himself was having a
difficult time in Pittsburgh “ally-
ing” himself with ministers in-
terested in his project. Though he
has met with encouraging results
in Washington, New York, Phila-
delphia, and other major cities on
his tour of the U. S., the Reverend
has been unable to make head-
way in Pittsburgh for a strange
reason. Religious leaders interest-
ed in his plans have been unable
to, speak German, and, when he’s
found German-speaking clergy-
men, they have invariably been
disinterested.

Still, he’ll probably remember
Pittsburgh more for catering to
his language problem, than not.
Before he left the city, his hosts

arranged a luncheon with 'the_

German-speaking members of the
Pitt faculty. His nemesis, the use
of__ English, was forbidden.

This is the first time the French

such an award.‘One of the main
purposes of the Committee is edu-
lcational exchange, and in the past
gthe Committee has brought stu-

‘study, but the Committee has
‘never sent a Pitt student to
‘France.

The award has been started
entirely by money contributions
and beneﬁts raised and saved by
the Frenc1i_ Room Committee.

Third oflha Series

Backfield Has Array
Of Steady Returnees

— By DON KAISERMAN
If quantity were more important, than quality, Coach
John Michelosen would have no problem with his 1956 Pan-
ther backﬁeld, especially at the halfback and fullback posi-

tions.

At least four deep in top men at each of the latter posts,
the locals must ﬁnd a combination that will click to give them

the much-needed offensive punch without sacriﬁcing any

defensive skill.

Dick Bowen, who last year. was

/ the only sophomore on the start-

ing eleven, heads the returnees at
left half. Other candidates for this
post back from the Sugar Bowl
fray are Corky Cost and Jim
Theodore. This experienced trio
will be hard pushed by two prom-
ising sophs—John Flara and

George Haley.

Bowen Returns at Halfback
Bowen, a 195—pound junior from

Duquesne, is a converted quarter-

back. Taking over the starting
halfback role midway in the sea-
son, he proved to be an outstand-
ing defensive back as well as a
hard runner to stop. His chief

CORKY cosr
Breakaway scatbaclc

it‘ 311 Pl:
Weakness seems to be that he
lacks the speed to be a breakaway
threat.

In the latter department, his .
understudy last year, Corky
Cost, is probably tops on the
squad. Speedy and shifty, the
5-10, 170-pound senior is al-
ways a threat. However, Cost
is handicapped by his height on

' pass defense.

Junior Jim‘ Theodore, capable of
starting status on most college
squads, was
string duty for the Blue and gold
last year. A winner of the most
valuable player award in’ the
Pittsburgh Jaycee All-Star Game,
he is potentially a great all-

_ around performer.

Flara Bares Watching

Breaking through three return-
ees to gain a spot on the ﬁrst team
may seem to be an almost impos-
sible‘ task,_,_ but soph John Flara
may have the ability to do it. A
175—pouncl scatback from_Midland.
Flara is very fast and will at least
see action as a pass receiver and
possibly as a‘ punter.

George Haley is another new-
comer who could make things
interesting. He runs well from
either the halfback or fullback
s'lot. .

At right half, Ray DiPasquale, ,

.who alternated with Lou Cima-
rollillast season is back for an-
other ﬂing. An expert defensive
back, he always makes his pres-
ence felt when the other team
has the ball. Ifhe can improve as
a runner, DiPasquale will -have
little trouble holding down a
starting position. , _
Bagamery '1‘ops Kickers

But if offensive punch is need-
ed, two-time-letlterman Nick Pas-
sodelis is the man for, the job.
Handicapped last year by a rib
injury, the 180-pound senior did

.not have much chance to displa
' his wares. . . V

Bugs Bagamery, another sen-
ior, can be used for spot duty
and will handle thekickoﬁ and
extra-point chores. -Top new.
prospect for. this position is Joe

relegated .to third— V

Scisley, a 6-0, 180-pounder from
Danville.

Heading the fullback parade is
last year’s usual starter, Tom
Jenkins. Plaguec?’ by injuries,
Jenkins has not yet achieved the
starring role forecast for him after
‘his spectacular spphomore debut.

Jenkins Jinxed
Still jinxed, the East Liverpool
senior will be out of spring drills
due to a knee operation he is
scheduled to undergo. How much
this will hurt him remains to be
seen. Jenkins played most of the
defensive ball last season and al-
ternated with Bob Grier when
the Panthers had the pigskin.
Junior Ralph Ciper and sen-
ior Ralph Jelic. are the out-
standing candidates to replace
Jenkins should his knee slow
him down. Both are lettermen.
Ciper is a good blocker and de-
fensive player while Jelic, who

v

Seeks H B Slot

also operates from the halfback
spot, is a top-ﬂight punter and
ball-toter. \

Chuck Abrachinsky, who was
bothered by injuries last year, and
sophs Jim Zanos, Bob Stark, and
Fred Riddle are also in the run-
ning for the line-bucking post.

Pitching—Ci)llapses
As Brown, Moog

' Get Racked Hard

By AL ABRAMS

The Panther baseball team

is sti1l.looking for its ﬁrst vic-

’__,,,tory of the 1956 season after

 i/"founding out the ﬁrst Week by
' losing four straight contests.

The team lost their third and

fourthvgames ofthe season Friday

and Saturday of last week at

Athens, Ohio, in a two game series

with Ohio University.

On'Friday, Coach Bobby Lewis

tried to come up with another

V starting‘ pitcher when he started

A Dale Brown, but Brown and three

relief hurlers who followed him

were unable to get out'the side as

Ohio piled up l8.hits and gathered

13 runs to storm to an easy 13-1

. victory over the winless Panthers.
 A The Pitt batters also had their
‘ troubles as they could gather
only two hits off right hander
Ralph Nuzum and didn’t have a
hit through the ﬁrst seven in-
..nings of play. In the eighth, a
l double by Corky Cost and a.
single by Bill Stret produced the
only Panther run of the after-
noon. » .

On Saturday, after a rainstorm

« l held up the game for 50 minutes,

 '- the Panthers again took the ﬁeld

against the Ohio team, and, al-

though the score was more re-

; spectable, the result was the same
= and Ohio came out on top 7-5.

’ - Fast-balling Ronnie .Moog went
the distance for the Pitt nine. Al-
though he gave up only six hits,
he walked 12 batters. Ohio U. gath-

, cred ﬁve runs in the ﬁrst inning,
one in the. second,zand held off a

 late three-run "seventh

surge by the Panthers to cop ‘the
 victory. ‘
