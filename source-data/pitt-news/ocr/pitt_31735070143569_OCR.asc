Wiring, not arson

starts one-alarm fire I

by Drew Singer
New Editor

Following an arsor1 investiga-
tion, the Pittsburgh Fire Depart-

ment deterrnined that a one-alarm"

ﬁre on the 300 block of York Way
in Central Oakland Thursday night
was accidental.

There were no injuries, and no
one was inside the apartment build-
ing at 308 York Way —— located be-
tween Atwood Street and Meyran
Avenue — at the time of the ﬁre.
The ﬁre started around an electric
fan on the second ﬂoor, said ﬁre
department Lt. Marc Kelly.

Four ﬁre trucks arrived at the

virtual tours available

brick building after the ﬁre was re-
ported at 9:18 p.m.

Police cars blocked trafﬁc be-
tween Atwood and Louisa streets,
Meyran Avenue and Sennott Street
and York Way and Bates Street as
the tire trucks navigated their way
toward the scene

Kelly said that the response was
standard procedure for a one-alarm
ﬁre.

He added that there was minor
ﬁre damage, estimating the damag-
es to be about $1000. Fireﬁghters
had to remove one window in the
rear of the 

The building was vacant and

undergoing remodeling.

Tuition hikes necessary for students and school  e

Pay up, Pitt

For Pitt students, the start
of each new school year often

I comes with higher numbers on

University bills. This year is no
exception.
Pitt’s‘ Board of Trustees vot-

? ed- last week to raise tuition for

the 2008-2009 school year. The

‘ trustees decided to increase in-
 state tuition by 6 percent and
j out-of-state tuition by 4 percent
 on the main campus. In-state
1 students at Pitt’s branch cam-
 puses in Bradford, Greensburg,
 johnstown and Titusville will see
§ a 4 percent tuition increase, and

out—of—state students will see a 2

. percent increase. Since 1998, tu-
: ition has increased by about 118

percent.
For many cash-strapped col-

 lege students, some of whom rely

3531')’-

heavily on loans, this tuition hike

-‘ can come as a severe ﬁnancial

burden. But what many students
don’t realize is that it’s also neces-

According to a Pitt press re-

 lease detailing the University’s

budget for the coming year, state
funding represented 32 percent
of Pitt’s operating budget in
1975. Today, it represents only 11
percent.

Pitt Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg told the Post-Gazette,
“The only revenue stream that
has not kept pace is the state ap-
propriation, which puts us at a
disadvantage as we compete with
more generously funded pub-
lic research universities in other
states.”

Struggling to keep up with

_ the decrease in state funding, the

successes of competing universi-
ties and the rate of inflation, it

seems that Pitt’s only reasonable
solution is a tuition raise. As our
university steadily moves up in
the rankings and attempts to earn
a more prestigious status in the
nation, this increase will enable
Pitt to maintain its position as a
respectable institution. If this is
the direction we want Pitt to take
— higher status and a higher level
of education —— then we should
accept the high costs that come
with it, ,

Furthermore, with its decision
to raise tuition, Pitt has not for-
gotten about the ﬁnancial well-
being of its students. Keeping a
balance with the tuition increase,
the Board of Trustees also voted
to increase ﬁnancial aid by 5.6
percent, according to the Univer-
sity press release.

But with tuition costs increas-
ing almost every year, it is irnpor—
tant that .Pitt eventually deﬁnes
its ultimate goal as a scholastic in-
stitution. Does Pitt want to grow
and expand into a prestigious, pri-
vate institution, competing with
the likes of Harvard and Yale? Or
is it looking to stay in this current
happy medium, where it can pro-
vide students with a high-quality
education and a reputable faculty
without demanding extremely
high amounts of money?

Knowing where the Univer-
sity wants to stand in the coming
years will not only make students
more aware of the value of a Pitt
degree and the worth of their
university, but it will make the
tuition increases much easier to
bear. Perhaps students will be
more willing to fork over the ex-
tra cash in hopes of pushing Pitt

, toward its common goal.

Africa needs an intervention

 
    

by Giles Howard
Co/umnzlat

Robert Mugabe is still in power

in Zimbabwe, and the government

of Sudan is still  its citizens at

will, but the people of both nations

can now rest easy because the Afri-
can Union is on the case.

Adhering to both its dogmatic
anti-Western philosophy and desire
to solve as few of the problems
plaguing Africa-as possible, the AU
has recently opposed action by the
International Criminal Court to
bring Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the
genocidal dictator of Sudan, to
justice and rejected any efforts by
Western nations to impose sanc-
tions on Mugabe’s government.

But what else can you expect
from an organization that counts

among its member states a number i

‘of dictatorships and their close al-
lies?‘ » .
Thabo Mbeki, the president
of South Africa, was supposed to
use his nation’s economic clout to
bring a peaceful end to the Mugabe
dictatorship. Instead, Mbeki has
displayed a _sickening deference to
Mugabe and his thuggish rule.
Mbeki has clouded the inter-
national discussion with the anti-
Western and anti-colonial rhetoric

of black South Africa’s ruling po-
litical party, the African National
Congress. Both the ANC and
Mugabe came to power through
anti-colonial struggle, and both are
now using the history of European
colonialism to shame the West into
inaction.

But Mbeki shouldn’t be able to
shame anyone into anything. He is,
after all, the man who denied the
lir1k between  and AIDS for
years while millions of Africans
died of the disease.

The real problem is that West-

ern nations informed by post—colo--

nial guilt and liberal idealism have
decided to let organizations such as
the AU solve their own problems

‘without Western interference. But

the AU has failed miserably in this

regard, and Africans are forced to

suffer the consequences of their
leaders’ incompetence.

But last week it looked as
though the Western nations of the

UN. Security Council would ﬁnally

act to protect the people of Zim-
babwe even if Mbeki and other
African leaders would not. The
United States and the United King-
dom sponsored sanctions against

Mugabe’s government that ir1clud- .

ed travel restrictions and an arms
embargo. However, China and Rus-
sia both exercised their veto powers

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

to prevent the sanctions from being
enacted._

The only thing that this recent
development in the Security Coun-
cil proves is that neither an entirely
international nor regional solution
is possible in Zimbabwe. Instead, it
is time for Britain, as the former co-
lonial power in possession of Zim-
babwe, to step in and restore order.

Regrettably, the problems faced
in addressing the crisis in Sudan are
fairly similar to the problems in ad-
dressing Zimbabwe, as once 
the AU has proven incapable of
solving regional issues.

The AU has maintained a
roughly 7,000-person peacekeep-
ing mission in western Sudan since
2005 that has accomplished little,
and now the AU has made it clear
that it opposes the International
Criminal Court’s indictment of
Bashir for crimes of genocide. The

AU’s Peace and Security Council _

even released a statement express-
ing “the AU’s concern with the mis-
use of indictments against Aﬁrican
leaders.” '

I can’t even imagine what the
international response would be
like if a European country had ex—.
pressed “concern” over the indict-
ment of Serbian president Slobo-
dan Milosevic. The fact is that the

president of Sudan is a criminal,

Use diplomacy, not military in Iran

    

by Dan Camarda. i
Colummbt

 
 

It’s time to get serious about
Iran. _

There has been pressure from
the United Nations and European
Union for Iran to suspend and
remove its nuclear facilities. De-

spite claims from Iran that its ca-
pabilities are for civilian use only,
Western nations, led by the United
States, have been calling for Iran
to eliminate its nuclear program or
face  action.

Iran, much like North Korea in
2006, tested its Shahab—3 missiles
on July 9 in a display of its sover-

eignty and military capabilities and i
in the face of pressure to halt its.
.nuclear ambitions. ,

The Bush administration must
approach Iran in the same man-
ner and with the same enthusiasm

as it did North Korea in order to'

effectively remove Iran’s potential
nuclear weapons, ease tension in

Mugabe,

Howard, page 8

and the AU has decided to try to
protect him just like they are pro-
tecting Mugabe.

Authoritarian regimes in Russia
and China have to be tolerated by
the international community be-
cause such countries are too pow-

the Middle East and avoid milita-
ristic action.

The diplomacy used by the
State Department in ﬁnding a

-peaceful route to disarm North

Korea is exactly the model to use
in defusihg Iran. While the recent
missile tests by Iran might seem

-like a declaration against negotia-

tion, it should be noted that diplo-
macy moved forward in 2006 with
Korea regardless of Pyongyang’s
testing of a nuclear weapon.

Bush engaged North Korea
despite an increasingly hostile Kim
Jong—il, a model it’s time to adopt
when dealing with Iran.

Currently, the adrninistration
has decided to ignore the leaders
of Iran while imposing sanctions
in an effort to cripple the nation.
Unfortunately, rather than prevent

Iran from establishing the facilities ,

needed to develop nuclear capabil-
ities, this strategy has been ineffec-
tive and has instead allowed Iran to
peruse an atomic route.’

Bush needs to establish mul-

is politically incorrect, it is true.

In Zimbabwe, life expectancy

lowest of any country in the world,
hypennﬂation has destroyed the

tilateral negotiations with Iran.
In dealing with North Korea, it
became clear that unilateral talks
did not supply enough pressure
or leverage to force Pyongyang
to halt its nuclear program. Thus,
six—nation talks developed between
China, South Korea, North Korea,
Japan, the United States and Rus-
sia.

Russia and China can again
be powerful allies in helping to
prevent Iran from developing a
nuclear weapon. Both countries
have better relations with Iran and
would beneﬁt from a stable Middle
East, and their inﬂuence would be
welcome in swaying Iran’s path.
Bush should also reach out to Iraq,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and the EU to
help guide Iran away from a nucle-
ar future. 0

Bush must [focus on easing ten-
sion between Israel and Iran in the
same way that he focused on less-
ening the tension between North
Korea and Japan. Just as Israel is
irate over Iran launching missiles,

Mbeki unfit to lead

and while I know that such a thing, ‘Western nations that should now

take matters into their own hands.
But none of this is possible if
the citizens of Western nations do
not change their attitudes toward
their nations’ pasts. Colonialism
was and is morally objectionable

Japan was [incensed following
North Korea’s nuclear test in 2006.
However, with multilateral talks es-
tablished,Japan did not act militar-
ily.i

Iran must also be assured of
its sovereignty, even if that means
rebuking Israel for statements and
military exercises aimed at Iran. Is-
raeli spokesperson Mark Regev has
already said, “Israel does not desire
hostility and conflict with Iran.” It
must illustrate its peaceful com-
mitment to ridding Iran of nuclear
capabilities through multinational
diplomacy and refraining from
striking Iran’s nuclear facilities.

Finally, Bush must avoid using
the military at all costs. North Ko-
rea’s statements and actions over
the last few years tested the Bush
administi:ation’s resolve in dealing
peacefully with Kim Jong—il. That
same sense of resolve needs to
be used again when dealing with
Iran. Iraq and Afghanistan have
stretched our capabilities militar-
ily, and the manpower needed to

remove the current regime in Iran
and then establish an effective gov-
ernment is beyond the scope of
our current forces.

If military power is not used,
there is the potential to turn Iran
away from direct hostility toward
the United States and into a po-
tential ally in the Middle East. If
it is used, however, a second Iraq-
like situation is likely. With Iran
accused of aiding insurgents in
Iraq, the possibility to stabilize two
Middle Eastern nations through
diplomatic negotiations with Iran
is tangible. '

How Bush decides to handle
Iran will dictate American foreign
policy for years to come. Despite
temptation to illustrate the United
States’ military powers, the Bush
administration needs to use its
North Korean model of diploma-
cy to establish an effective, peace-
ful precedent for future foreign

policy conﬂicts.

As thousands of people rubbed the hangover out of their I
eyes and wandered around the huge campground of the All
Good Music Festival in Masontown, W Va., Bill Remington

sat alonein a chair, his back upright, seemingly already pre-

pared for the day. i _ . V 
“I feel wonderful. I’m relaxed, I’m cl1illed.::I_t’s been good
—— it’s been all good. I’ve no plans of when to leave. Maybe to-

, day, maybe not,” he said. ‘Tve’corne iforfour  by myself. I" p‘
always run into people I know. We’re a very strong community, A

tightknit W/e’re alike people," no matter how olclyou are.”

. Remington was at least 55,  a gray  square face 

and.  almond eyes "scanning the scene his surii
glasses. He grinned peacefully, knowing, it seemed, that every-

 

 

.    

 

 one offiiae . .0

V The sceneiwas surreal —— the same masses, which, the.
 night befo_re,'had been wildly ﬂailing, dancing impossibly fast
 to the musical‘ labyrinth that blared from the stage, were now

,tw_o,hQursaftlel;,leavingOaldat1dwitl1acarﬁlﬂofs1lppﬁes¥—atent,beef:i

thing was in its right place. i

It was two days and two nights after I’d_a.rrived at the All
Good Music Festival, a huge, non-stop collective of experi-
mental, improvisational rock and funk and electronic and
bluegrass bands from all over the country. I’d seen and expe-

l rienced so much,‘felt and heard so much more, that I might

as well have been  an entirely different world. And for the
20,000 people camping out in veritable tent cities around
the beautiful  Mountaintop site, that was exactly the

subdued, walking around like me, half asleep and half won-
dering, “Did that all really happen?”

But Remington’s tone was calm — his low voice and his
urlfaltering  brought me back down to earth. The weekend
—— the madness of 20,000 bodies dancing and singing and
talking and smoking and ﬂying higher than the mountain itself
— was, in fact, real. Though it was newer to me than most,
it was no less a tear in the fabric of reality — a break from
full—time jobs, from taxes, from television, from problems and
from worries. But for people like Bill and the community oﬁ
for lack of a better term, hippies who travel far to see live
music like this, the real world and the All Good world have
melded into one.

Senior Staﬂ Wrder
Checking, in from the Pitts-

burgh Pro-Am Summer League at"

the Greentree SportsPlex: _

Pitt’s young guards continue to
insist with their play that the shoot-
ing guard position might not be
as detrimental to Pitt’s success as
originally diagnosed.

In the, ﬁrst game of the night,

sophomore Bradley Wanamaker
and freshman Ashton Gibbs of
FWG Realty put on a shooting
clinic against Levance Fields, De-
Juan Blair and Aliquippa. GE.
Entering the game, Wanamaker
was wielding a 56 percent clip
2 4' from
hind

the league in
3-point shoot-
a ing. ’ Gibbs,
knocking - down
44 percent of his 3—pointers, also

. ranked near thetop.

Wanamaker started the game off

' with a 3-pointer and continued his

hot shooting throughout. Matched
up against Fields for most of the
game, he showed a toughness and
aggressiveness against the more ex-
perienced and physical Fields.

Gibbs did the same.

“[Wanamaker’s and Gibbs’] abil-
ity to shoot and drive makes them a
threat at all times,” said Fields.

‘They also play tenacious de-
fense, so they both really ﬁt what
we’re  to do as a team.”

¢

.be- ;

‘ Fields drained a crossover 3-pointer‘ I
to tie the game at 85. Before Fields’

Wanamaker hit three 3-pointers
in the ﬁrst half to help FWG open
up a 22-9 lead just 10 minutes into
the game. Using the threat of his

‘jump shot, Wanamaker was also

able to knife through Aliquippa
GE’s defense at will. Wanamaker
ﬁnished the game with 27 points
and shot 3 for 4 ﬁom 3-point
range.

ﬁnishing with 15 points on 7-of—8
shooting, while knocking down all
three of his 3-point attempts.
Gibbs showed good quickness
with the basketball as well as supe-

rior court vision running the break-

cides to do with his lineup, both
guards will be competing for the
starting shooting guard spot, which
was vacated by the departure of
Ronald Ramon. _

While Gibbs and Wanamaker
were impressive from beyond the
are Monday night, sophomore cen-
ter Blair was as well.

Blair ﬁnished with 35 points and
20 rebounds, completely dominat-
ing the inside. Blairlalso knocked
down two big 3-pointers to keep
his squad in the game in the ﬁrst
half. ‘

In the second half, Fields, who

ﬁnished with 39 points and four as-

sists, came alive.

Pitt hoops lands commitment

by Tony Ferraiolo
Senior Staff [Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball
geam acquired a special talent
Monday when 6-foot-8-inch
power forward Dante Taylor,
of National Christian Academy
in Fort Washington, Md., gave
Pitt coach Jamie Dixon a verbal
commitment for 2009.

Dixon had reason to smile at

the Pittsburgh Pro Am Summer-

League Monday night, as Taylor
is regarded as a ﬁve-star athlete
and one of the top players in
the class of 2009 at his position.
Among others, Pitt beat our
national powerhouse programs
Connecticut, Memphis and
Kansas to land Taylor.

Taylor announced his decision
at the Triple:."S Harley Davidson
Shootout inizlvlorgantown on the
campus of West Virginia.

He’s set "to become part of

what could be one of Pitt’s best
recruiting class. ‘

The Panthers already have
a commitment from four-star
prospect Lamar Patterson of St.
Benedict’s Preparatory School in
Newark, NJ. .

Darnell Dodson, who came
to Pitt in 2007 but failed to
receive proper clearances from
the NCAA Clearinghouse, is also
set to return after a stint at Miami
Dade Community College.

Gibbs was equally impressive, ~

Then, 0 with six seconds left,

But the game belonged ‘
to Wanamaker. On the
ensuing inbounds, Wana-
maker took the ball coast
to coast and was fouled -
by Blair. He hit the ﬁrst .

In the third game of
the night, freshman guard
Travon Woodall showed
that he also has the abil-
ity to help Pitt’s backcourt
this season and might be a
formidable heir-apparent
at the point guard spot
when Fields departs after
the season. ' '

Woodall efﬁciently, ran
PGT’s offense, showing good
range and hitting two 3-pointers.

Woodall has shown the ability
to shoot from the outside through-

out the summer, which gives him a

good chance to ﬁght for minutes
in a crowded Pitt backcourt when
the season rolls around. Woodall’s
speed and good decision-making
