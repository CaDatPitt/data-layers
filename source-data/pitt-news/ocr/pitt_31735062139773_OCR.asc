Index Shows Decline

 

The preliminary index for general
business activity in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict, for the week ending March 23,
showed a. slight decline from the ﬁg-
ure for the preceding week, dropping
from 72.6 to 72.2. The level for the
same period last year was 66.4. Fig-
ures were announced by the-Univer-
sity Bureau of Business Research.

By Joseph Rosenberg

Before an enthusiastic audience of
about 1,200, the lVIen’s Glee club sang
its annual home concert at Carnegie
Music hall Friday night. Directed by
Dr, Walter H. Wright., professor of
clinical prosthesis in the School of
Dentistry, the club presented a varied
program including such widely diver-
gent numbers as “The Floral Dance,”
a Cornish air by Moss, and a Bach
choral, “Rejoice Christians.” Negro
spirituals and Czecho-Slovakian dance
songs, Harvey Gaul, Stephen Collins
Foster, Franz Schubert, were all rep-
resented. <

A group of songs by the male quar-
tet and two baritone solo numbers by
Alfred M. Knauss, C35, completed the
vocal part of the music. Perfect dic-
tion and clear tonal quality made
Knauss’ performance decidedly ﬁne.

Mlle. Renee Nizan, soloist of the
Pas de Loup concerts at the “Champs-
Elysees” and of symphony orchestras
in the United States and Canada,
again delighted her audience.

Displaying a. technique combining
boldness of touch. with delicacy of im-
agination, her interpretation of the

works of Bach, Gigout, Ri1nsky-Kor-
sakoff. Dallier and Vierne bespoke a
thoroughness
few organists.

The charming young exponent of
the “king of instruments” attributes
much of her success to her early train-
ing and to the musical atmosphere in
which she spent her early childhood.
Her father, M. Henri Nizan, was or-
ganist and master of the choir at the
Boulogne-sur-Seine church, Paris.

That American organists and stu-
dents of the piano select the music of
all countries as recital numbers seem-
ed a most interesting fact to Mlle.
Nizan. “You know in France we play
only French music; German students
conﬁne themselves to’ the music of
their own country. But Americans—--
they play the music of any country-
as long as it is beautiful and Appeal-
mg.”

Both Mlle. Nizan and M. Nizan have
been the guests of Dr. ‘Wright. When
asked about their impression of Pitts-
burgh, they responded with a sincere,
“\7Ve really love Pittsburgh. Your
Cathedral here is beautiful, the like
of which we have never before seen.”

Audience Reverses Former Decision;

Aﬂirmative Debaters Win Points
At Delta Sigma Rho Meeting
In Battle Of Budgets

“The college graduate should marry
on $1500 3 yea1'.” Despite the strong
veto given the proposition by a Penn
1_State audience a few weeks ago and
the similarly negative opinions of
prominent campus ﬁgures formerly in-
terviewed by The News, the Univer-
sity said yes Friday by an audience
ballot after hearing a debate on the
subject between the Penn State men
and the University women.

Of the 47 people casting votes, ten
who were neutral or in favor of the
negative to begin with, changed their
minds, after hearing the debate, to
the aﬂirmative side, 11 who believed
aﬂirmatively at the start were more
strongly affirmative after the dis-
cussion, and eight who were original-
ly for the affirmative remained so.

Of those who originally were neu-
tral or believed with the affirmative
that the young man should go right
ahead on $30 a week, nine changed
to the negative afterwards, and three
who believed so at the beginning re-
mained negative. Three people who
believed at ﬁrst that no college grad-
uate should take the big plunge on
$30 a week, were more strongly con-
vinced of this after hearing the argu-
ments. 'l‘he remaining six casting
ballots who believed either affirma-
tively or negatively at first decided
afterwards that there was a lot to be
said for both sides and switched to
neutral.

Both sides chalked up- their mini-
mum budgets for a college couple on
a blackboard, the aflirmative side
maintaining that exactly $1500 a year
was enough and the negative insist-
ing that it should be nearer $2000 a
year,

The affirmative budget, for a year
as ,presented by James Townsend of
Penn State was as follows: shelter,
$480; transportation, $550; household
operations, $75; food, $360; clothing
for the man, $130; clothing for the
wife, $150; insurance, $35.70; litera-
ture, .$20; recreation, $70; medicine,
$40; miscellaneous expenses, $79.30.

Townsend claimed that the ﬁgure
for n1en’s clothing was deemed satis-
factory by his fraternity brothers and
that the ﬁgure for women’s clothing
need not be so high, although the
college graduate would not ordinarily
marry a nudist.

The negative put up their budget
on a monthly basis, because, said
Marcella Leyton, C37, the large
amounts of money in a yearly budget
gave a false impression. Their budget
as given by bliss Leyton for a month
was: shelter. $45: food, $40; man’s
clothing, $10; wife’s clothing, $15; in-
surance $10; medical care, $10; rec-

13 Greek Heads
Will End CPSF
Tomorrow Night

 

Body Expected To Approve Final
I-F Constitution; To Ballot
Under Preferential Plan

By Ron

And the world moves on. _

The Council of Presidents of Social
Fraternities is, as campus organiza-
tions go, a very young institution; last
year there was no Council of Presi-
dents of Social Fraternities. Next
year the Freshman handbook will list
no such group.

Four initials frequent in News head-
lines will be put away among other
campus relics—-Student Council, the
Men's Self Governing Association, the
Pitt Liberal club, and the University
branch of the League for Social Jus-
tice,

Tomorrow night 13 solemn frater-
nity presidents will meet for the last
time as CPSF. The Phi Kappa house
will serve the last dinner to the group
which will no longer be.

N. Robert Seidle, assistant to the
dean of men, in an off moment, pro-
phesied the return of an Interfrateiu
nity Council to this campus by the
second week of April. Seidle is on his
way to his second progiiosticating
bulls-eye-——his first scored in anticipat-
ing the exact number of men to
pledge fraternities this semester.

All of which adds up to the fact
that the office of the dean of men
apparently feels conﬁdent that frater-
nities are again capable of managing
interfraternity activities without ex-
cessive political strife. And I-F coun-
cil, which was, outlawed here almost
a year ago because of an electoral
standstill marked a bitter Greek
against Greek coalition strife, will be
back again, or so point indications.

Leslie Vvilkins, C35, Delta Tau Del-
ta, chairman of CPSF, announced to
The News that the constitution for
I-F council will be read in probably
ﬁnal form, and approval by the body
is expected.

The new constitution guards against
many former abuses. Election of of-
oﬁcers will be by the Hare system of
preferential ballot, with all fraternity
members voting later in the month.
There will be ﬁve men on the Execu-

. tive board, with the four amassing the

highest vote totals occupying the con-
ventional four offices.

Also on the agenda. for tomorrow
night is discussion of the Interscholas-
tic program run in conjunction with
Spring Festival week in May. Cups
for sports tournaments will be award-
ed, also.

If CPSF approves the new I-F con-
stitution, as is anticipated, it will be
:=ubmitted to the fraternity committee
for expected ﬁnal message. In May the.
new group, comprised of two men from
each house instead of only the presi-
dent as under CPSF laws, will meet
and arrange ﬁnal organization.

Junior representatives from each
house will be appointed by the in-
dividual fraternities at chapter meet-
ings tonight. These men may then
petition for nomination for the Ex-
ecutive board by ﬁliug special blanks
due in the office of the dean of men
by April 13.

Jolznstown Auxiliary May
Sponsor Cap, Gown Show

Tl1eodo’re W’. Biddle, assistant dean
of men and chairman of the Cap and
Gown production staff, and John Hos-
selbein, C35, publicity chairman, are
meeting with the Junior auxiliary of
the M,en1orial hospital of Johnstown
this afternoon to negotiate for a. spe-
cial performance of “In the Soup” im-
mediately after Cap and Gown closes
its run at the Nixon, May 11.

Mrs. Karl Fronheiser is president
of the Auxiliary and chairman of the
executive board which will make the
decision.

-Cap and Gown’s last road perform-
ance was in 1930 when the troupe
playetl “Manhattan Preferred” in
Uniontown.

Theodore Viehman, director of the
new show, has returned from Cam-
bridge, where he supervised the pro-
duction of the Harvard “Hasty Pud-
ding” show, and will resume cast re-
hearsals tonight at the Y hut.

‘Music_,~Words, Rhythm’

Dr. Lotte O. Lohstoeter, assistant
professor of modern languages, is the.
author of an article, “lvlusic, words,
and rhythm,” in the current issue of
the German Quarterly. This work,
written in German, is concerned with
the music and rhythm in the writings
of the Romantic school.

 

ﬁt making frequent appearances on
campus, will supply impetus to the
thousand or more pairs of dancing
feet expected.

Miss Katherine Till and Mrs_ Carl
F. Distlehorst will be chaperons for
the event. The style show is free.

Annual Pitt News style shows have
been campus institutions for some
years back. This is only the second
year, however, in which shows have

Lockhart Outlines
Orchestra Plans

Concert Bands, String Quartets
Listed Among Changes

 

   

By Ray Maclntyre

Lee M. Lockhart, newly appointed
head of instrumental music at the
University, has been formally intro-
duced to his new band and orchestra,
and believes that Pitt has great musi-
cal potentialities. He tentatively out-
lined his plans for the future after a.
strenuous practice session with the
orchestra Thursday night.

If Mr. Lockhart has his way, there
will be at least two orchestras here
shortly, and a number of smaller
units, such as string and brass (Nar-
tets, trios and sextettes. One of
these orchestras will be composed of
the more experienced musicians, and
the other of the creme de la creme.

He also plans two good concert
bands, in which he believes women
should be allowed to participate.

“With these gradations, there would
be more opportunity for constructive
work for all concerned, since all will
fall in classes suited to their ability
and stage of adva11cement,” he ex-
plained.

The new man comes to Pitt. with a
reputation for insistence on precision,
tonal quality and general ﬁnesse.
Above all, he believes in punctuality
in be;,rinning rehearsals. and consci-
entious application of effort during re-
hearsal periods. He is well-known in
Pittsburgh as the supervisor of instru-
mental music in the Pittsburgh high
schools, and directs the All-City high
school orchestra and the All-City high
school band.

Alumni Represented

John VV. W. Hallock, secretary of
the General Alumni Association, and
Don Saunders, editor of the Pittsburgh
Record and the Alumni Review, leave
tomorrow morning for Washington,
D. C., to attend the National Alumni
Council conference from Wednesday
to Saturday.

April 1 and James R. George

(Headline note:—-James R. George
is the Post-Gazette humorist. We told
Mr. George it would be a good April
Fool joke if he wrote us a letter. He
told us it would be a bigger joke if
we published the letter. We're pub-
lishing the letter.)

Dear Headlines:

Certainly I will write you a piece
about April Fool’s Day. It is pretty
lucky you asked me when you did,
though because I am practically
swamped with demands for same. If
there has been one magazine asked
me to write my opinions on this great
national holiday there have been two.
The reason I am giving your great
publication the preference is because
the other ones wanted so much for
printing it.

Well, Headlines, I might as well
announce right off that what I am
in favor of is lousier practical jokes
for April Fool’s Day. The trouble
with the kind of gags people always
get off is that they are not hilarious
enough.

For instance, they used to send
kids around to get a. bucket of steam
or a. left-handed monkey-wrench, a.nd
when the little ones came back, what
did you have? A kid without a bucket
of steam or without a left—handed
monkey-wrench. There is not much
fun in that. What we need is more
vitality in our jokes. They don't last
long enough.

My aunt Sophie had the right idea.
Aunt Sophie was the one that married
Uncle Phillip in ’79. If you didn't
know Uncle Phillip, either, why skip
it? Anyhow, Aunt Sophie played the
funniest jokes on people around April
One. I remember the time she sent
Uncle Phillip out to the spring-house
to get a slab of butter, slyly neglect-
ing to mention that she had loosened
three of the steps to the front porch.
Uncle Phillip’s leg was broken so bad
they ﬁnally had to slaughter him, but
the whole community got a good
hearty laugh out of this little inci-
dent, and what is better than whole-
some fun and a jolly laugh, respec-
tively?

A distant relative of mine had a
ﬁrst class wheeze which he executed
one April Fool day, but it got him
into trouble, so maybe you had not
better try it. He inveigled a horse
out of his neighbor’s pasture and hid
it in his own barn. As he explained
later, he intended to drop in while
said neighbor was at supper worrying
over the horse, bring the equine right
into the kitchen and say “April Fool.”
However, at the trial were a lot of
evil-minded rats that said he was cele-
brating April Fool with people's
horses that way practically every day
in the year.

The judge believed this low gossip
and sent him away for a year.

Well, Headlines, there are many
other things which I might say about
April Fool's Day, but they are too
funny for publication, so I am saving
them to use when I get aged and need
something to talk about to myself, be-
sides my government pension.

Yours for more bloodshed on holi-
days,

JAMES R. GEORGE.
P. S.—April F001! I won't get any
government pension.

In the affirmative budget, Miss Ley-
ton pointed out, the man of the house
was not provided with any money at
all to buy lunches with.

Marguerite Swank, C85, in opening
the debate for the affirmative side, ad-
mitted that contrary to the practice
of all debaters she ‘did not claim to
have any practical knowledge at all
of the subject. The negative speak-
ers did not argue that-point.

The debate, which was given at
Heinz House as part of the second
annual conference of Delta Sigma Rho,
national honorary forensic fraternity,
was a repetition of a similar debate
given some time‘ ago on the Penn
State campus by the same speakers.

Invitation

EVERY University organization with a claim to

signiﬁcance should arrange to take part April
12 in the national student demonstration against
war, when student bodies all over the United States
will leave classes at 11 o’clock to attend “peace
assemblies.’ ’

The University Assembly, because as representa-
tives of the entire Student-Faculty Association
they have both initiative and responsibility in ex-
pressing student opinion.

The College Association, because it has greater
potential inﬂuence than it can exercise merely in
arranging dances and scliolarships.

Omicron Delta Kappa, because its tradition of
service to the University includes the obligation
of peace education.

The Reserve Oiiicers’ Training Corps, whose rel-
ative advantage over civilians iii a knowledge of
military tactics obliges them to assist every move-
ment for peace.

The YMCA and the YWCA, because their char-
ters and traditions are based on intelligence func-
tioning in a society at peace.

The faculty, the honorary fraternities, the social
fraternities, because war will proﬁt none of them.

Bringing The Chapel To Llfe
OTICE of a contest that will be sponsored by
‘ Phi Epsilon, pre-ministerial fraternity, for a
proposed program for the Heinz Chapel, reminds
us that the Chapel will soon become a part of life
at the University. Bright green sods of grass will
be tucked up against the Gothic stone, and ﬂagged
walks will connect the Chapel with other Univer-
sity buildings.
It will take’ something more than grass and

 

stone, however, to bring the pattern to life; and
the proposed program, when Phi Epsilon chooses
to recommend one, should attract students regard-
less of their inherited denominational preferences.
Students are not particularly religious in 1935, and
the Chapel faces an interesting challenge. With
its perfect physical symbolisin and its stained
glass windows, it should be an experiment in stu-
dent sensitiveness under optimum conditions.

Paging The Greeks
A F0124 ‘Lloyd’Panning

By Alan C. Lloyd
OST OF OUR fraternities on campus. have an awk-
wa.rd regulation that pledges should never precede
their betters (the brothers) through any doorway. This
rule, however, is a. weak compromise of the old ques-
tion, “Should a gentleman enter the doorway ﬁrst?” and
has rather unfortunate implications. This is really a. se-
rious question, for it involves the dignity of every Greek.

A Thousand Times No!

Let us take the incident of a revolving door, such as
we boast in State hall. Here the issue is this: should
the brother make '-the pledge precede him, contrary to
the rule, in order to furnish the power to revolve the
door, or should the brother go first and thus permit Mr.
Pledge to coast through on his better’s push? Now the
regulation of course gives the pledge the big advantage,
and any such advantage is detrimental to the prestige of
the brother. On the other hand, if a special rule were to
be made for revolving door, it would imply that frater-
nity brothers are parasites—on the pledges, I mean-
for the well-known popular deﬁnition of a parasite is,
“An individual who goes through a. revolving door on an-
other’s push!” Certainly the name “parasite” would up-
set our ent_ire‘f1-aternal system. At the present time, at
the State hall doors, some fraternities have tried remedies
such as causing the pledge to wait for the door to stop

Mondav. April 1. 1935

after the brother's passage. This however necessitates
the delayal of the brother, who, being a gentleman, needs
must wait for his companion.

The Power Of Accomplishment

Indeed, this same matter can be applied to any door,
and especially to such as are on the ground ﬂoor of the-

Cathedral, where in winter the breeze makes the doors-

diﬂ“1cult to handle. Of course it must be granted that
fraternity men like to start things going, and it might

be just barely possible that they could rationalize the
Fraternity man pushes revolv--

process along that line.
ing door; resolved, he has started something; therefore,
he is justiﬁed in pushing» the door for the pledges. In

the case of an obstinate Cathedral door, the thought pro-»
fraternity man forces open the door‘
against great pressure; resolved, this is symbolic of his-.

cess could be:

power of accomplishment in life; therefore, he is justi-
ﬁed in opening the door for his pledges.

“Women And Children First!”

The “unfortunate implications” I mentioned above are

related to the suggestion that these processes are rather

effeminate, for, as gentlemen, must not all fraternity‘

men support the doctrine, “Ladies ﬁrst?” Likewise the
issue extends to the creed that has represented genera-
tions of sea-faring heroes:

of any Lady-and-Gentleman creed. It is generally con-

ceded that the Crusades had some connection with they
, matter, especially the women’s suffrage crusade during
the war, although we grant‘ that the connection is’:-

strained.

Drop it

VVhat, then, is to be done about this most ‘perplexing-‘

matter? It has been the source of constant embarrass-
ment to our classic gentlemen, both in practice and in

theory. There are, as I can see, only three suggestions’

to be offered: ﬁrst, make a point that no pledges near a
door when brothers might be there; second, do noth-

ing, and be embarrassed by the attention this article-

may attract to the practice; and third, drop the whole
idea, which is not such a bad idea, at that.

“VVomen and children ﬁrst!”'
It is rather difficult to narrow down the origin of this»
issue, just as it is rather hard to narrow down the origin.

ence title, and a portion of the city
honors.

For the third successive season the
Pitt ﬁve walked away with the East-
ern Intercollegiate Conference cham-
pionship by whipping a scrappy ‘West
Virginia team in a play-off game,
35-22. In the city league the Panthers
smacked Tech down twice but split
in their two games with the ;Dukcs,
giving the two rivals a 50 per cent
cut in the top honors.

In the first two games of the sea-
son Panther followers were given an
inkling of what to expect of the cage
team. The opening battle found the
Golden Panthers looking very impres-
sive in swamping Bucknell under a
rain of baskets to win, 52-22. ‘Six
days: later, out in Evanston, a coin-
plete reversal of form found the Cats
taking a 42-28 whipping from North-
western and looking very ragged while
taking it. 2

In the next seven games the Panth-
ers played some ball that looked very
good and some that did not look so
good. Four western schools were
knocked off. and then came the Dukes
who plastered a two-point defeat on
the Panthers to continue their own
winning streak. Tech was taken,
38-37, in a. thrilling game with Skippy
Hughes popping one through the
cords in the last ten seconds to give
the Cats the victory. Then once more
Carlson's boys hit a bad night, trav-
eling to Philadelphia only to have a
sure-eyed flock of Temple Owls hand
them a 45-38 defeat. '

Cat's Run Wild

Here the Panthers stepped out, win-

ning all but one of their next 13
games, and exhibiting the best brand
of ball that they showed all season.
Notre Dame, Westminster, and West
Virginia trouped into town the same
week, all with exceptionally strong
clubs, and all trouped out with the
same result, wasted energy.
- A week later. a powerful. Navy team
took it upon themselves to avenge the
Panther football licking last fall, and
led by Buzz Berries, nosed out the
Cats in the last few seconds, 24-22. In
the next eight games the Panthers
were unbeatable, handing Notre Dame
its second defeat. nosing out Du-
quesne in a 35-34 thriller as Roderick
saved the day, and avenging the defeat
at the hands of Temple by easily whip-
ping the Owls at the stadium, 35-25.

to spurt in the last two minutes, wipe

games with VVest Virginia. who by
decisively beating the Cats in the
ﬁnal scheduled game, knotted up the

Tennis Prospect
Appears Bright
As Stars Return

VVIIGII Coach David O’Loughlin, ten-
nis coach, gets outdoor practice» start-
ed, he will ﬁnd ﬁve lettermen from
last year's team, several promising
net stars from the freshman outﬁt,
and numerous hopefuls striving for
positions on the varsity team.

Due to the weather conditions, the
stadium courts won't be in condition
until sometime next week. However,
most of the aspirants have been get-
ting in. shape by playing on private
courts or stroking the ball against
backyard cement walls.

Jimmy Slocum, Joe Madden. Jimmy
and Lloyd Tliompon, and Roy Heck-
ler are the letterinen returning. Bob
Madden, freshman ﬂash of last year
and winner of numerous district
titles, is a ﬁne prospect for one of the
six varsity berths. Other players
who have signed up for tryouts in.
clude Gibney, Ingham, Vvilson, Nor-
ton, Newman, Kinney, and Golanty.

At the present time, 13 freshman
candidates have reported for practice.
They are Friedman,—Locke, Milligan,
Bald, Conti, McKenna, Megan, Besch,
Rackoff, Sigmon, Treusch, Solow,
Striﬁler, and Stuck. Bald, Solow‘, and
Mclienna appear headed for posi-
tions, having been outstanding play-
ers in la.st fall’s University tourna-
merit.

All tennis candidates are urged to
report to the stadium to get their eli-
gibility cards ﬁlled out, so that no time
‘will be lost --when the intensive prac-
tice sessions get under way.

The varsity netters open their sea-
son April 11 against George W'asliing—
ton at Vvashington. Following that
match, the team will play Navy and
Georgetown the following da.ys, re-
turning to Pittsburgh to await the
home opener.

Originally the team was slated to
open April 6, with the Panthers meet-
ing Bethany, but this match has been
postponed to a later date in the sea-
son.

In last season's competition, the
tennis boys made a ﬁne showing, win-
ning 11 out of 12 matches. The one
defeat was handed out by the Navy
outﬁt.
