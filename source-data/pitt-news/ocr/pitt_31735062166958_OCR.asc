Non — Technical Grads
Says Placement Official

by ANNE DORN
Recruitment of non-tech-

ernrnent agencies recruiting at
the University last fall request-
ed non-technical bachelor degree
graduates.

Of those 36 per cent, 72 per
cent requested -economics ma-
jors.

Non-technical graduates are
those with BA degrees in the
humanities, psychology, earth
and vpilane-tuary sc-iences, or so-
cial sciences. Technical grad-
uates include engineering, chem-

. istry, physics, biology, and math-

ematics majors, according to the
Placement Center.

Oyler’s report stated that of
the 348 companies on campus
during the fall, 26 requestul
non-technical graduates only,
and 100 both technical and non-
technical graduates. The posi-
tions for which the most grad-
uates were sought fell in sa.les,
with 57 companies (46 per cent)
asking for graduates qualiﬁed
in that ﬁeld. ‘

OMICRON DELTA EPSILON

Omicron Delta Epsilon, the
national honor society in eco-
nomics, will accept applica-
tions for membership until
Feb. 9 from all undergrad-
uates who believe themselves
to be eligible for election. Eli-
gibility requirements are:
over-all University QPA of
3.0; minimum of 12 completed
credits in economics from the
Oakland and branch campuses
of the University, including
Economics 11 and Economics 12
or their equivalents; minimum
QPA of 3.0 in all economics
courses taken at the Universi-

_ ty. Membership applications

may be obtained from the sec-
retary of t-he Economies De-
partment in Dithridge House.

 

The report also described the
1967 spring campus recruitment.
In that period, 449 companies
and government agencies visit-
ed the University; 178 compa-
nies showed an interest in non-
technical graduates and/or tech-
nical graduates (4O per cent of
recruiting).

In the spring, business ma-
jors were the most popular
graduates, with 68 per cent of
the 178 companies indicating a
desire for them. Sales also show-
ed a plurality during spring, tak-
ing 47 per cent of the non-tech-
nical gnaduates.

Dr. Walter Ritenour, director
of the Placement Center, noted
from the report that opportun-
ities in non-teclmical ﬁelds are
available, but added that “op-
portunities are in areas to which
people have to adapt them-
selves.”

On Rights Under Draft Act

by IVAN ABRAMS

Young men wishing to
know more details about
their rights under the Mili-
tary Selective Service Act
of 1967 may now receive
this information from Draft
Counseling Committee of
the Wes-tern Pennsylvania Aca-

demic Council on Problems of
War and Peace (WPAC). Eigh-
teen faculty members from the
University are currently serving
as counselors with the WPAC.
According to Dr. Robert Gib-

-so-n, associate professor o-f psy-

chology at the University and
chairman of the WPAC, “Stu-
dents seemed to feel there was
.a need for objective counseling,
due to the complexity of the Se-
lective Service regulations and
-the new draft law which elim-
inates many deferments, espe-
cially those of gwnaduate stu-
dents.”

The counselors, .six of whom
are lawyers, maintain a ﬁle o-f
the latest legia-1 briefs on court
cases involving the selective
service laws, a manual of the
effects of the Selective Service
on students is presently in prep-
ara.t.io»n.

Dean of Student Affairs
Attends   Conference

Monday, Jan. 22, Dean of Student Affairs Jack Critch-
ﬁeld attended a conference of statewide college adminis-
trators to discuiss the recent crisis over drugs and the over-
all problem of drugs on campus.

This is what the meeting was supposed to do, but be-
cause of the publicity of the recent scandal and the claims by
politicians, the purpose of the event was overlooked. The
conference was held in a large auditorium, complete with

TV coverage and formality.

The representatives o-f the
various colleges delivered pre-
pared statements. They used
the opportunity to say that their
school had no drug problem on
their campus and that there
was no truth to the LSD story.

In Dean Critchﬁeld's state-
ment, which he delivered ex-
temporaneously, he said he was
disappointed that the meeting
was not more informal. He
stated that at the University no
magic solution for the preven-
tion of the use of drugs has
been found.

Dean Critchﬁeld told this re-
porter that he was disappoint-
ed that the meeting did not dis-
cuss the crux of the problem:
why young people, with rights
of college students, are so over-
whelmed by their problems that
they must turn to drugs.

Dean Critchﬁeld maintains
that the news media has blown
the drug controversy out of pro-
portion and that sensationalism
is not the vehicle by which the
problem will be solved. He add-
ed that alcohol is still the larg-
est problem on campuses today
and little attention is paid to it
by the news media. '

Dean Critchﬁeld ended the in-
terview by noting, “I am con-
cerned that there has not been
relevant investigation on the ef-
fects of all drugs. The main
problem of the conference was
that emphasis was placed on
ﬁnding the college with the LSD
blindingswnot on ﬁnding a solu-
tion.>;to the problﬁﬁn.’

   

training” job. Many companies
and government agencies have
been interviewing and are in-
terested in hiring a boy or girl.

A “sumer training” job is dif-
ferent from la.bor type of work.
Summer trainees are given prac-
ticai “on the job" work relat-
ing to their major if it is tech-
meal; If a student is an arts
and science major, he is consi-
dered for employment where his
abilities and college training are

needed.

Companies are here for one
week. Make appointments with
Student Employment, 224 SU,
for interviews and a-sk for the
schedule of companies interest-
ed in summer trainees.

Gibson says that “We have
been meeting with several Uni-
versity administrators to try to
expand the counseling program's
effectiveness. Soon,” he contin-
ues, “Publicity will be sent to all
31 faculty chairmen in Arts and
Sciences and Engineering.”

Draft counseling on the cam-
pus, rather than in the commun-
ity at large, seems to have orig-
inated at Temple University in
Philadelphia, where stu-.dents be-
came confused over their draft
status. The WPAC service was
initiated early last rterm and is

“in keeping with the request for ,-

an informed public expressed by
Draft Director Hershey,” says
Gibson.

The WPAC itself was tonmed
in early 1967 to -discuss prob-
lems about this country’s War
and peace policies. The WPAC
regards the Vietnam war as the
most important of the current
pvroblems.

For a number of reasons most
members of the WPAC reject
the present policy of ending the
war, that is, by increasing the
scale of the ﬁghting as 1maccept-
able. The council, therefore,
seeks and supports alternative
policies. However, Gibson em-
phasizes that the draft counsel-
ing service is purely objective
and seeks only to inform stu-
dents of the provisions of the
law and the rights of the regis-
trant.

“We really just want to help
people,” says Gibson, and he
urges students to contact him
at 621-3500, ext. 433, 434, 435, or
436.

  

Dr. Thompson Concludes World
‘Too Confused’ About DrugProblem

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY

“I’m very sympathetic
about the marijuana prob-
lem, but this doesn’t mean
that I feel that it’s all right
to smoke it,” stated Dr.
Douglass Thompson, direc-
tor of the Student Health Serv-
ice. Dr. Thompson -spoke on
“Drugs and the College Scene”
at an At-H-omeiat-Pitt program
Monday night. _

He went on to say that “there
is too much talking about the
drug problem and not enough
listening. The world is about as
confused and schizophrenic as it
can be."

The development of the phar-
macological industry has
brought a wide variety of drugs
to public attention. Of these,
LSD is probably the most po-
tent.

The biochemical properties of
LSD are not speciﬁcally known.
Long term effects are hard to
analyze and real dangers may
develop. Dr. Thompson feels
that “there is a great potential
for LSD in therapy and investi-
gative medicine. It is important
to remember, however, that
users under any circumstance
must be properly chaperoned

pu-s during the At-Home-at-Pitt program.

during a trip,” he said.

“Right now,” he remarked,
“LS-D is an extraordinarily dan-
gerous thing to do, but it may
not always be this way.”

Dr. Thompson also pointed
out that there are approximate-
ly 400 million users of mari-
juana. This number is more
than -the citizens of the United
States, and also is more than
the total of Protestants and
Jews of the world combined.

“Marijuana has never been

  

shown to be toxic,” he said, “and
there is no evidence that mari-
uana users commit more crimes

g or go on to heroin addiction.”

'I'-hornp-son stressed that “there
has never been a decent scienti-
ﬁc study t-o show any dangers

of marijuana at all.” The World 1

Narcotic Act made the selling,
pushing, and cuitix/Iation of mari-
juana illegail, yet not many coun-
tries make personal use of the
dru-g illegal. M

Pollock Notes

Of Jewry in USSR

by ALAN E. BARR
-Dr. Allan Pollack described
the early y-ears of the Soviet

' Union -as a stable economic per-

iod for the Jews in his lecture

9 Monday night. Dr. Pollack poin-t-

ed out that the Soviets turned

‘ to the Jewish intelligentsia since

it did not ﬁght the new regime.
At the same time, the govern-

"ment tried to do away with re-
‘ ligiion of any sort.

During the 1920’s Dr. Pollack
noted, the Russian government

took a large number of Jews

into adrninistrative positions. As
a result, the Jews became part
of the Russian middle «class. The
g‘-overnment went as far as mak-

‘ing anti-Semitism a crime and

actively punishing violators.
The Soviets did have a mo-

tive, however. A.nti-Semitism, as

Dr. P-olllack observed, encour-

,aged the Jews to remain a

group. By giving the Jews new
freedom (-all of the former Tsar-
ist restrictions on the Jews were
albolish-ed), the Soviets hoped to

~ assiimlilate th-e Jews -into Rus-

sian society. Jewish publications
and theater operated on a large
scale. However, said"Dr. Pollack,
the Russian government made
every attempt to -abolish the
Jewish religion along with all_
other religions.

The Soviets made other at-
tempts to assimilate the Jews.
First, Dr. Pollack mentioned
that they tried to redirect Jews
into agriculture, and then, to
give them their own state in
Russia. This “state” is the Biro-
Bidzhan experiment. Both of
these failed. ,

The Russians turned to the
Jews as they needed all avail-
able educated man power to run
the new regime, Dr. Pollack
stated. However, at the same
time, the Soviets wanted to abol-
ish the Jewish religion from the
new Socialist government.

Dr. Pollack, assistant profes-
sor of Russian history, will give
four more lectures in which he
will bring the history of the
Jews in Russia up to the pre-
sent. His lectures are part of
a series at the YM and WHA.

 

Peace Corps Faces Neiv Challenges

Vietnam War Affects Group

(Editor’s note: The Peace Corps
is now recruiting the University
campus.)

WASHINGTON (CPS) ——The
Peace Corps, once the Mecca of
many student idealists, is on the
threshhold of what could be the
most crucial period in its sev-
en-year history.

Few will deny that the Peace
Corps has been one of the most
successful and popular of the
New Frontier programs initiated
during the Kennedy Administra-
tion. But the Peace Corps now
faces many new and delicate
problems, most of them a di-
rect re-sult of the war in Viet-
nam.

The tactfulness with which
these problems are solved with-
in the next few years may well
determine whether or not the
Peace Co-rps can survive on a
large scale, and if it can, how
effective it will be in accomplish-
ing its original mission.

Peace Corps officials-—who in
the past have had little trouble
convincing young people to give
up two years of their life to
work in an underdeveloped coun-
try—-now ﬁnd themselves on the
defensive for the ﬁrst time. The
major problem is the Peace
Corps’ close association with the
federal government at a time
when the government is unpopu-
lar among young people.

Peace Corps officials, including
Agency Director Jack Vaughn,
are not ready to admit the Corps
has problems. But so-me other
high -ranking government offi-
cials hlave conﬁrmed privately
that the Corps may be in trou-
b-le.

Recruiting ﬁgures alone indi-
Cate the Peace Corps has less
appeal now than it had a year
ago. In November, 1966, the
Peace Corps received 7,097 ap-
p-licaitio-ns from college seniors.
Last November, applications
were ﬁled by only 3,768 seniors,

the Corps is losing its appeal
to students. “The decrease is at-
tributable to the style of recruit-
ing in the fall of 1966 compared
to that in 1967,” one official ex-
plained. “In late 1966, we put on
a major recruiting drive which
hit its peak in November. In
1967, however, we visited 25 per
cent fewer schools in the fall.
During the current academic
year, we will have our major
recruiting effort in the spring.”

Since most Peace Corps vol-
unteers come directly from the
campus, the Corps’ recruiting
ﬁgures are based on the aca-
demic year. So far, applications
this year are running about 4,-
000 behind last year. “But with
our major recruiting drive still
ahead of us, we expect to at
least equal last year’s ﬁgures,”
Vaughn says.

Despite efforts by Corps offi-
cials to convince the public that
it is not losing its appeal, offi-
cials admit the Corps is more
controversial on the campus to-
day than at any other time in
its history.

The main reason for this
Vaughn said, “is a feeling that
we are an official part of the Es-
tablishment.” One government
official expla.ined, “Before the
United States became deeplly in-
volved in Vietnam, young peo-
ple did notcmind so much being
associated with the government,
but now they do.”

However, Vaughn says the ex-
panding group of student radi-
cals who want to completely
dissociate with the government
is not affecting the Bears Garnis-
“We don’t in any sense, or nev-
er have, tried to tailor a mess-
age for the activist. Our mess-
age is more to the concerned,
and the concerned can be of al-
most any political stripe,” he
said in an interview.

But Vaughn admits Peace

Corps recruiting on campuses is
more difficult now than it was
several years ago. “Most cam-
puses are boiling,” he said.
“There is more noise and more
turmoil, which makes it much
harder for us to get our mess-
age through.” A few years ago
it was easy for a recruiter to
talk with students, he said. “But
now there’s a lot of rivalry, and
it’s harder to get that conversa-
tion for a. half hour.”

4‘

Ailthough the Peace Corps is
associated with the “Establish-
ment,” there have been no prob-
lems between re-cruiters and stu-
dent radicals, Vaughn said.
“Words have been exch.anged on
occasion, but nothing to consi-
der a confrontation.”

The major problem for Corps
recruiters comes when a college
or university gives them space-
in their placement office rather
than in a prominent open area
on campus, such as in the Stu-
de-nt Union Building, Vaughn
said. “We don’t seek respectibil-

ity. All we seek is a chance to...‘

talk, and if nobody knows where-
yo-u are, your expo-sure is so
limited you don’t have a chance
to talk.”

When Vaughn talks about the
present status of the Peace
Corps, he emphasizes that the
total number of volunteers over-
seas—now about 15,000—is high-
er than ever before, and the
Corps is expanding at the rate
of about eight new countries a
year.

Whether this expansion can
continue or not, however, is un-
certain. “In the past,” Vaughn”
admits, “the only thing holding
us back has been the lack of
enough candidates to serve as
volunteers.”

‘Tour’ Is Indeed a Mystery

by JOE ANDERSON

Have you ever been on the
“Magical Mystery Tour? I
hear it’s very pleasant, very
pleasant indeed! One meets
all sorts of interesting peo-
ple, I'm told. There’s a wal-
rus, an eggman, an export
texpert, some “Fool on the
Hill,” a crabalocker fish-

, wife, a pornographic priest-

essand a Whole bunch of
people who get lost in the
fog in LA.

It’s all Very strange. Why the
guide told me (no, not the one
with the beard but the one dress-
ed as a wa.1rus) that there’s a
mass of semolina pi-lchard as-
saulting the Eiffle Tower. I
swear it; that’s just what he
told me (no, not the one play-
ing the drums, but the one with
the bass).

What kind of songs do they
play? The hits from a long time
ago. “Your Mother Should
go ask he-r. Sing it

too. I asked the guide if it was
true (not the one dressed as a
walrus, but the one with the
mustache). He conﬁrmed it.

And thatgone guide with the
round -rimless glasses, his name
is John, I think, said that the
man on the hill has delusions.
He sees the world spinning
’round and thinks everybody else
is the fool. I don't like him. No-
body likes the “Fool on the
Hill.”

I almost forgot to tell you
I saw Raul sitting on a corn-

drums; the one playing the pi-

for a garbage truck, but I could
tell by the look in his eyes that

Billy’s Knickers just fell down
again.

Ringo (thartis the one vvzith the
drums) and George (he's the
one with the mustache) weren't
there. They got caught in the

they won’t be long. I feel sort
of in a “Blue Jay Way” when
they're not here, if you know
what I mean.

glamour jobs” in industrial re-
ltait-ions, advertising, and public
relations, should be able to dem-
onstrate their skills in a prac-
tical sense.

“One of the first things a re-
cruiter in public relations or ad-
vertising will want is to see an
interviewee’s writin-g. The com-
panies want some work experi-
ence. . . One shouldnit close
one’s eyes to a general educa-
tion, but that's not what -a re-
cruiter is looking for. A stu-
dent should also have a practi-
cal background of summer jobs,
or extra - curricular activities,”
stated Dr. Riten-our.

“A student should major in
the ﬁeld he likes and in which

he can excel. He could at the
same time be taking advantage
of a job, practical courses, read-
ing or at least researching the
thing he wants to do.”
Although the opportunities are
not endless, they are available.

One large retailing company, -

said D-r. Ritenour, offered $606
a month to management
trainees. It preferred liberal! arts
graduates. An electrical data
processing company paid $605
a ‘month to the psychology ma-
jor it accepted. »

If not going straight into a
job after obtanining his BA, the
graduate should go on to grad-
uate uschool, commented Dr. Rit-
enour. “If one has made an in-
vestment in a BA, he should in-

b_ project well

vest in a Master’s to gain pro-
fessional comzpeten-ce.”

Dr. Ritenour stated that be-
tween 400 and 500 government
agencies and companies from
across the country visit the cam-
pus to recruit graduates. He rec-
ommends that any senior grad-
uating in April or August, even
if he plans on attending grad-
uate school, should arrange for
an interview. “If his plans
change, he has had a chance to
see people who have come thou-
sands of miles to the Univer-
sity.”

Page 4 — THE PITT NEWS -- Wednesday, January 31, 1968

This week the ground floor in the Cathedral is the scene of a re-
cruitment effort by representatives of the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps
doesn't have the novelty it had seven years ago when it was ﬁrst devel-
oped. There are no dynamic national leaders now who symbolize to young
people the idealism that the late President John F. Kennedy transmitted

to us. But the job done by the Peace Corps has not diminished; it has

continued to grow and make its imprint.

, Unfortunately, the Peace Corps is victimized by the revulsion cer-
tain students feel towards the “establishment.” Because it is a govern-
ment agency, people tend to identify it with the policies of the Johnson
adrnginistration and thus dismiss it because of this connotation. This is an
unfair generalization error, for does not the Peace Corps exemplify the
type of solution now advocated by many critics of the war—namely, a
means whereby underdeveloped nations can be strengthened on the grass
roots level, using tools suc-h as education to accomplish the real feats?

The volunteers here on campus this week spearheading the recruit-
ment drive remarked that the large campuses are not as responsive to-
ward the Peace Corps as they once were; it is almost as if a feeling of
disillusionment has set in. We think this is a correct "analysis, as we con-
tinually witness stu-dents express a sense of futility in countless situations,
a feeling that they cannot change the status quo, so why bother trying.
This was reﬂected‘ in our Student Government elections last week when
only 2,500 students out of a possible 8,000 participated. The simple act

-of casting a ballot held no signiﬁcance for the majority of our students;

they simply did not care.

 

 

 

A Journey of a Thousand Miles I *

We cannot criticize this alienation too harshly, for there are all too
many reasons that justly enforce this sense of futility that so many stu-
dents feel. Too many hopes have not been realized. A recent survey taken
among college students asked them to name a hero; it was difficult for
many to cite anyone. The void created by the late President Kennedy’s
death has not been ﬁlled. In all fronts, be it national politics or civil
rights, dreams have not been realized and the “promises to keep” have
not been kept.

We do not have to accept this state of affairs, however. As one
former Peace Corps volunteer stated, she had moved from working for

causes, and crusades in -general into a situation centering around inter-‘V

personal communication. Obviously, her work in the Peace Corps did not
change the state of the world, but she made a little dent toward altering
the status quo——she made a contribution.

Resignation is too easy to accept~—and far too dangerous. It is
lamentable that all too many of us, accept defeat so quickly. But we must
heed the philosophy that a journey of a 1,000 miles does begin with a
single step. The war in Vietnam will not come to a halt automatically.
The “establishment” in Washington will not alter its course in response
to our disillusionment. But that does not bar us from making our mark.
If we sit back and remain armchair critics, are we not really accepting
the status quo? Why not take that alternative and make a constructive
contribution, such as joining the Peace Corps or VISTA? Then "we will
have begun that long journey—we will have taken that vital ﬁrst step.

Commuters’ Plight

A Reciprocal Responsibility

The plight of the commut-
armwas. .0.I_1.e _._9f;.- the. issues
brought out in this Student
Government (SG) cam-
paign. Such items such as
recognition of the Commut-
er Association, early even-
ing social functions, ample
lounge and study space, im-
proved parking conditions,
and increased bus service
should be attained for com-
muters—or at least be given
a good push in the right di-
rection.

Poor communications be-
tween commuter and dorm
student, and commuter and
campus organizations, have
been plaguing the Univers-
ity long enough. It is fitting
and significant that the
problem should have been
made an issue for the SG
platforms.

Commuters have com-
plained that the University
gears itself to the dorm stu-
dent. In this election, some
commuters declined to vote
because they felt they didn’t
have enough knowledge of
thecandidates and of the
issues. They claimed that
poor advanced notices of the
speeches and forums and
poor campaigning in gener-

al discouraged their inter-
est. ‘If only 2,484 voted in
a school of approximately
20,000 in which a great num-
ber are commuters, there
must be a tremendous lack
of communication within
the University.

This is a deplorable situ-
ation, and the very fact that
Pitt is a “large, urban uni-
versity” does not make the
problem any easier to solve.
By its make-up, Pitt is a
partly dorm, partly com-
muting University. But by
its role as a college, it must
be a “home away from
home.” Even before the es-
tablishment of its state-re-
latedness, it was always 50
percent dorm students, 50
percent commuters. The ra-
tio may have changed but
the problem remains the
same: How can the Univers-
ity balance itself between

-the demands of residents

and of those of commuters?

Obviously, there must be
a give and take relationship
established between the stu-
dent powers-that-be and the
commuters. The University
can change neither its state-
relatedness, nor its increas-

ing number of commuting
students. The solution is
largely in the hands of stu-
dents-—both residents (and
local apartment and home
dwellers) and commuters.
The commuters should ex-
pect the cooperation and aid
of Student Government and
other organizations in at-
taining their requests.
Commuters, on the other
hand, must show a recipro-
cal interest in the Univers-
ity. Admittedly, it is diffi-

cult for commuters to be-

come involved in certain ac-
tivities, especially ones de-
manding evening hours,
as SG. Unfortunately for
commuters, much of the
work done by campus or-
ganizations is at night and
many meetings are called
for the evening. The Uni-
versity can become too easi-
ly a glorified high school
for commuters: they come
to school, they attend class-
es, and'they go home.

But the commuter must
learn that he has to sacri-
fice a few hours and a few
conveniences to participate
in extra -curricular activit-
ies. There is an organiza-
tion or committee on this
campus for practically eve-
ryone, and not all meet dur-
ing the evening. True, not
all of them have a strong
voice in formulating student
policy. Yet if the student
involves himself in at least
one activity, he is more apt
to care about the state of
his. University as a whole.
This pertains as well to the
dorm students, who natur-
ally are more inclined to be-
come active. The commuter,
however, should realize that
he must inconvenience him-
self and put into this Uni-
versity what he expects—-

and should deserve -—- from

it. A V V e i

Students Hit
SG Election

Editor, The Pitt News:

The recent Student Govern-
ment (SG) election was an elec-
tion in name only. It could have
been a “legitimate” election if
some actions were absent and
others were present.

Neutrality was supposed to be
presented by the SG Eecftion
Committee. Instead, this com-
mittee ba.cked the eventual win-
ner instead of being nonparti-
san.

Seco-ndly, the illogical selec-
tion of some of the voting areas
was unnecessary and’ slightly
unfair. Engineering students
were allowed to vote both on
lower campus and in Engineer-
ing Hall. On the other hand,
medical and dental students‘
could not vote at Scaife Halfl,
where their classes are. Phar-
macy students could vote at
Scaife Hall, where their classes
are, so why couldn’-t medical
and dental students be given
the same privileges? Isn't this
a deﬁnite -advantage for students
in engineering and a deﬁnite
disadvantage for tho-se in the
health professions?

One of the greatest inﬂuential
factors to students who do not
live in the dorms (i.e.——those
who commute or those who live
in apartments off campus) is
The Pitt News. As a. publication,
The Pitt News should have,
without casting their opinions,
logica.lly evaluated each candi-
date to give these off-camzpus
students a chance to decide for
themselves, instead of “advising”
on whom to vote for.

The Pitt News was a big sup-
porter of the winning party.
Now, after the election, they say
to forget the party and support
SG. Buat, wouldn't it be better
to have parties throughout the
year? This way, more people,
both on campus and off campus

help rid this campus of its
apathetic outlook toward
student needs. Involvement
in student affairsas a whole
not as dorm students’ inter-
ests vs commuting students’
interests, will lead natural-
ly to fulfillment of not on-
ly general student require-
ments, but also to commuter

. T.hrouglr a; V

   
     
 

would become involved, and, in
turn, they would be better in-
formed for the yearly elections
and wouldn't have to rely on
one primary source of informa-
tion.

Another point concerning in-
formation Was that, by the re-
sult, nobody seemed to appre-
ciate that one of the presiden-
tial candidates had experience
in SC. Without this being any
sort of a factor, the elections
seemed more like a popularity
contest, spiced with some gim-

micks. Even so, the winning can~§--

didate did not have a majority
of the votes, showing the stu-
dent body that this majority was
not necessary for victory. Such
a situation could make any
amount of opinionated “advice”
inﬂuential. This, too, adds to
the term, “election,” being some-
what inappropriaite.

Enough has been said. Let’s
see if the winner of the “popu-
larity contest” is effective in
SG this year. Bob Santos

Letter on Hair

Editor, The Pitt News:

I read with anger the letter
from E. Fineberg in The Pitt
News of Monday, Jan. 22. How
he could entertain the idea that
the Athletic Department has
now taken over loco parentis
from the administraltion is be-
yond me.

I can assure you that any stu-
dent, no matter what is wrong
with him, will not be refused
admittance to any course. They
feel that every human being
must have exercise and they
welcome the chance to give it to
him. This is the phillos-ophy put
forth to me in my first week of
classes.

Have you ever heard of any
aithlevte denied participation on
the team because of excess hair?
Of course not. Now how could
Mr. F-ineberrg suggest that the
Athletic Department would deny
him the class because 0-f his
hair. Everyone knows hair is
not indirectly prouport-ional to

morality. I am sure that they,.,,

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

President: Ken Frederick

KEN FREDERICK
President

This, the first of oz continuing series of “Student
Government Trimester Newsletters,” is designed to
inform students about their Student Government,
its projects, its Senate activity, and its plans for
upcoming months. “Student Government Newslet-
ter” hopes to increase student awareness and there-
by increase student involvement in areas of Student
Government which may interest them.

President and
Vice - President's Report

One of the most important problems that we
attempted to solve was the Book Center. The en-
tire issue became public late in the Winter Term
of 1967. The specific problems that we discovered
were then worked on during this past summer by
a nine-man committee including three administra-
tors, three faculty members and three students.
(The administrators included Dean Jack Critch-
field, Vice-Chancellor Montgomery, and Mr. David
Smith, Treasurer. The students included President
Ken Frederick, Howard Ainisman, and Linda Gold-
stein, Editor of the Pitt News.) The committee re-
viewed and discussed many Book Center policies,
particularly those about discounts for students, the
procedure for returning books after a _course has
been dropped, the selling of soft goods, and the poor
usage of the Fine Books Room. The most concrete
gain 'that resulted was that a 10% discount was
given on required hard cover text-books effective
this Winter Term of 1968. (This discount is calcu-
lated when the price is determined for the book.)

This is a beginning. The Book Center, particu-
larly its ﬁnancial policies, still has many unsolved
problems. We discovered during our meetings
the ludicrous condition of the Book Center’s records
and the inability of administration officials an.d
Book Center personnel to answer simple questions
concerning profit and loss, among other things.
Thus, though a beginning has been made, the suc-
cessful conclusion to the discussion and solution
regarding the Book Center and its problems is still
in the future. We hope that these students will not
let this issue die but will continue to work until
the student body is satisfied.

Out of State Tuition

Another issue that came to our attention this
term was the amount of tuition paid by out-of-state
students. This was passed by the Student Govern-

-ment Senate and brought to the attention of the

Chancellor by the Executive of Student Govern-
ment. It was not our intention to lower this amount
to that paid by in-state students. Our goal, instead,
was to lower tuition by a couple hundreddollars
to a level comparable to that of Penn State Univers-
ity and Temple. Such a reduction is not going to
happen right away, if ever. This does not change
the facts, however, that such a reduction should be
enacted and that we feel this would help attract
more and better out-of-state students. It will only
come about if ﬂuture Student Governments follow
our lead and continue to investigate this problem.

]anuary - 1968

Publicity Director: David Guyden

Secretary: Renee Mayers

the problems that so obviously beset the Student
Union. Our greatest concern was to increase the
number of rooms and offices to be used by stu-
dent groups. We discovered and argued that al-
though the building is called a “Student” Union,
the only floors used by students were the main
floor and the second and third floors—only three
of ten! We felt and still contend that this is not
enough space. Further, we criticized the system by
which rooms were allocated to student groups. Fin-
ally, it became obvious that the best way to get
more student involvement in the runr_1_i_ng 9; t_h§
Student Union was to strengthen the Student Union
Board. Some progress was made in changing these
situations. This Executive has done its part, but it
will be the job of future Student Governments to
insure that student groups have more space and
that the Pitt Student Union truly will be a “stu-
dents’ union.”

General Summary

The first obligation of this SG was to imple-
ment the revised SG Constitution. This has been
done, as noted in this Newsletter concerning the
General Assembly. In addition, approximately
60% of the planks of the platform on which we
ran last January have been implemented, which is
an extremely significant percentage and supports
our belief that we could implement those proposals.
Among some of the specific things that the execu-
tive has done are: reorganized the committee on
the recognition of student organizations, aided the
addition of more lockers for commuters in the
Cathedral, initiated extensive investigation into
Off-Campus Housing, printed the most complete
and extensive “SG Directory’’ and re-evaluated
the University's Freshman Orientation Program.
Two solutions to problems which were adversely
affecting students were initiated by this Executive
Branch. First, we fought until the hours at the
cashier's window in Scaife Hall were changed so
they were more advantageous and accessible to
students in the health professions. Second, in
great part due to our constant prodding the $15
change-of-course fee, scheduled to be initiated on
the first day of both last Fall and this Winter Tri-
mes_ter, was pushed back. Thus, students could
change courses without financial penalty. One of
our final projects is a Transit Poll that will be
conducted this month and next. Supported by our
Chancellor it will attempt to eliminate some trans.
portation difficulties and add P.A.T. bus routes
where needed. These are only some of the many
activities that this Executive Branch of the SG has
been responsible for. More activities are explained
in the rest of this Newsletter.

of faculty, administrators, and students (appoint-
ed by the president of SG) todiscuss the prob-
lem of overcrowded classes and to suggest pos-
sible salutions for amending the present situa-
tion betore it explodes into an academic disas-
ter. The committee will also investigate the di-
lemma of increasing class size and the height-
ening of students being closed out of classes.

Winter Weekend

"Winter Weekend 1968” promises to be un-
like any event ever planned and presented at
the University. Instead of the regular Thursday
night concert, there will be a gala semi-formal
in Webster Hall on Friday, with entertainment
by Louis Armstrong and the Shirelles. On Sat-
urday afternoon, a concert will be held in Carne-
gie Music Hall featuring the King and Queen
ﬁnalis-t performing in competition for their titles
and, as an added attraction, top talent from our
own student body. The traditional Carnival will
be held in the Student Union Ballroom on Satur-
day night and will be conducted in keeping with
the weekend theme, THE BEAT OF BROAD-
WAY.

Homecoming Committee

Homecoming, 1967, “The Wonderful World of
Walt Disney,” was marked by three days of
events beginning with the Thursday night dance,
featuring “Tommy James and the Shondells.”
The Friday night bonﬁre and pep rally was fol-
lowed Saturday morning with -a ﬂoat parade
through Oakland before the game, another high-
ligh-t of the weekend. Saturday night ended the
weekend's events with a concert by “The Yard-
birds” and the “Mitch Ryder Review.”

Parent's Weekend

Parent’-s Weekend, 1967, was highlighted by
the reception on Friday night where the parents
of the students had the opportunity to meet Pitt's

student organizations applying for funds to the
Allocation ‘Committee of SG will be “required” to

Freshman Orientation

The Freshman Orientation Evaluation Com-
mittee looked at the present orientation and then
recommended that any future freshman orienta-
tion program include “a complete, accurate orien-
tation” to three main aspects o-f the University.
These three major aspects were: 1. Academics,
so the freshman might better understand the
academic opportunities available at Pitt; 2. The
philosophy of the University of Pittsburgh, so
the freshman might meet the personnel at Pitt
and learn the traditions, mechanics, and other
particulars unique to Pitt; and 3. Student ac-
tivities, so the freshman could realize the learn-
ing experience of participating in student extra-
curricular activities, along with initiating class
and school spirit.

The‘ committee recommended many speciﬁcs
under these three general areas. The principle
with which the co-mmittee operated was that the
University of Pittsburgh was a distinct institu-
tion to which freshmen must be properly intro-
duced, a necessary step before the Univers.ity
can ever realize the full potential of its stu-
dents, and a stop which must be made during

5 Freshman Orientation.

The committee also recommended that up-
perclassmen were not essential to a good orien-
tation, and it suggested that the orientation in
the future might possibly be held during a one-
week period prior to the start of the school year
each fall.

SG Student Directory

This year's Student Government Student Di-
rectory Committee made signiﬁcant improve-
ments in the overall value of the Directory. This
year's Directory contained the most complete
listing of both undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents ever to be compiled to date. In addition,
a VISA promotion was initiated in the Directory,
which aided the VISA advertising campaign on
campus. Other features include Women’s Resi-
dence, Halls, .Men’s Dorms, phone numbers, ad-
dresses and phone numbers of Student Govern-
ment personnel, student activities’ offices and
phone numbers, and a listing of social sororities’
and fraternities’ addresses and phone numbers.

SC Book Exchange

Committee

The SG Book Exchange Committee thanks all
students for taking advantage of the services of
the SG Book Exchange, which operates at the
beginning of each term. The Book’ Exchange is
an excellent opportunity to purchase your books
at tremendous savings. The only charge to stu-
dents is ten cents for each book susbmitted.

Remember, greater participation will insure
a wider selection——so, save at the book exchange.

Purchasing Study
Committee

At an earlier SG meeting, provisions were
made for the formation of la “'Pu~rcha-sing Study
Committee” . . . to study purchasing procedures
for student organizations at Pitt, and to pre-
sent recommedations to the Purchasing Depart-
ment. THE COMMITTEE WILL BE OPEN TO
THE STUDENT BODY. All those interested in
serving on this committee are asked to contact
Bill Ralph either by calling 621-5834 or by dI'0P'
ping a note addressed to him at the SG office.
It is hoped that as many officers, especially
treasurers, of student orgianizations as possible
will see ﬂt to serve on this committee, although
anyone is welcome.

First General Assembly

The first meeting of t.he SG General Assem-
bly was held in the Student Union Ballroom on
April 1, 1967, the meeting being called to order
by President Ken Frederick at 1:20 p.m. Mark
Ravenscraft coordinated this first General As-
sc-mbly.

The following is a run-down of the content
of this initial meeting o-f the General Assembly:

1. The report from SG Senate was by Tom
Meisner, SG vice-president, who summarized
bills passed during the first months of the 1967-
68 SG Senate and the accomplishments of SG
Committee.

II. In the Allocation Committee Report the
methods used by the ‘committee in considefﬁﬂg
requests were explained. V ‘p   -

_,   

,_,

   
   
   

 
 
 

    

 

don spoke about the dorms on the hill and about
the newly established Men’s Judicial Board.

IV. Off-Campus Housing Committee Report:
Jack L-aPietra, chairman, gave a brief history of
the committee and outlined the work of the Off-
Campus Housing Committee in the Oakland area.

V. Business from the ﬂoo-r: the establishment
by the Student Union of a committee to look
into the possib-ility of a SU St-ore was announced.

The meeting was closed at 3:15 p.m. by the
presiding officer, Ken Frederick.

Second General Assembly

The second trimester General Assembly was
conducted on October 25, 1967, by Ken Frederick,
opening the meeting at 3 p.m.

I. Student Union Board Report:

Jeff Zdrale outlined the areas of activity of
-the Student Union Board. He stressed that com-
mittee membership is open to all students in
the University, reminding delegates that students
program events and provide the manpower for
the success of the Student Union Board.

II. Men’s Council Report: -

Dave Eh-renworth outlined proposed changes
in Men’s Council,. pointing out that the new
Men’s Council will be composed of members
from IFC, MDC, and Commuter Association. The
duties of Men’s Council will include such under-
takings as hosts for Freshman Orientation, the
Activities Fair, Upperclass Advisor program, ca-

reer conferences, and the proposed All Men’s 2

Judicial Review Board. ~

III. Commuter Association:

Bill Lenaghan covered the new Transit Proj-
ect, recently initiated by Student Government.
Facets of the project which have been proposed
are: 1. A Transit Loop to connect all Pittsburgh
city colleges; 2. A commuter poll at all city
colleges; 3. Changes in bus routes to make com-
muting less time consuming; and 4. Fringe park-
ing areas with shuttle buses ‘direct to Pitt for
a nominal fee.

IV. Off-Clampus Housing Committee:

Jack LaPietra reported on the progress of the
committee during the summer. The c-ommittee’s
recommendations were presented to Dean Critch-
ﬁeld who formed a Faculty-Administration Com-
mittee to work with the present Off-Campus
Housing Committee. According to the Com.mit-
-tee, the two main solutions to the off-campus
housing problem are: 1. University owned apart-
ment ‘buildiings, and 2. Joint effort on the part
of city-county officials, University Administra-
tion, and landlords to improve existing condi-
tions. Through the SG Senate, the committee has
recently expanded its focus to include not only
the availability of housing, but also the inves-
tigation of housing conditions.

V. SG Senate Report:

Tom Meisner, SG v~.i<ce-president, relayed Senate
activity since last April and commented on fu-
ture plans.

VI- Allocation Committee Report:

Dan Booker, representing «the committee, ex-
plained the criteria for allocations to organiza-
tions. He stated that the possibility of allocations
on a termly basis are being investigated.

The meeting was adjourned by Ken Freder-
ick -at 4:10 p.m. Co-ordinating the second Gen-
eral Assembly were Gary Cummins, Dave Guy-
dan, Jack LaPietra, and Rich Ombres.

Traditions Committee

The newly formed Traditions Committee has
been going into some depth analyzing such bas-
ic questions as deﬁning the nature of a tradition
and determining what relevence it has to stu-
dents.

Concretely, the committee has been instru-
mental in spawning the Orientation Evaluation
Committee and the Students Committee for Ac-
ton on Athletics, a group dedicated to resuming
Pitt's tradition of excellence in sports.

Realizing the necessity for future planning,
the committee has begun a study of re-introduc-
ing the concepts of classes, so that the emphasis
would be on the “class” of 1970 or 1971, as the
case may be. Projects to increase class unity,
honor founder's day, and revive a Christmas
Dance in the Commons Room could be valuable
additions to campus life.

Spirit Committee

The SG Spirit Committee reports the results
of the Spirit Award competition at the end of
the football season:

For breakdown and other standings, call
Bill Ralph, 621-5834.

The committee wishes to stress that genuine,
sincere spirit is the most important considera-
tion in this year's judging. There is no better
place to display spirit than at basketball games,
where groups are easily" identiﬁed and cheers
clearly recognized. The committee calls upon the
students to give Pitt a winning basketball team
through a winning, spirited student body. Groups
are urged to sponsor “date nights” at basket-
ball games with, perhaps, mixers or short par-
ties afterwards; invite the team, too! Make bas-
ketball games something really to loo-k forward
to. Of course, let the Spirit Committee and the
rest of the student body know what you are
doing.

Off-Campus Housing

Committee

On February 23, 1967, the Senate of Student
Government unanimously passed a bill that es
tablished an Off-Campus Housing Committee.
The basic tenet of the bill states that the enroll-
ment of the University's Oakland Campus is

expected to increase substantially over the next

few years, during which no new dormitory fa-
clities will be built. ~

These concurrent facts create a burden on
the over-all housing picture by decreasing the
ratio of available living units to students who
require housing.

The initial efforts of the Off-Campus Housing
Committee dealt with accepting the existing sup-
ply and demand forces in Oakland and maximiz-
ing within those conditions. A door-to-door sur-
vcy of every landlord and home-owner in a mile
radius of the University was conducted, thereby
investigating all the housing opportunities in the
area. Information on these dwellings was made
available by June 1 through the Dean of Men’s
Off-Campus Housing Oﬁice.

-However, it soon became apparent that the
committee could no longer accept the housing
situation in Oakland. A deﬁnite housing short-
age existed an-d many of the available dwellings
were overpriced and in poor condition. /

In response, the committee began to push for
apartment buildings that would be owned and
operated by the University. The reasoning be-
hind such a proposal would be to increase the
quality and amount of housing, to lower the
prices of the apartments, and to force the inde-
pendent landlords through competition, to im-
prove their dwellings and to lower their prices.
A first step toward realizing such a goal was
achieved when Dean of Student Affairs Jack B.
Critchﬁeld issued a statement which officially
recognized the problem and suggested a coali-
tion among administrators, faculty, and the Off-
Campus Housing Committee to examine thor-
oughly the problem and possible solutions.

Student Government further commited itself
to the PI‘0b1em by expanding the scope of the
Committee, which numbers 45 students to in-
vestigate conditions of Off-Campus Housing in
addition to availability of housing.

Harrassed Rob McFarland looks for help.

W The Judgement

by Jay Rosenstein
Sports Editor

   

Pitt has been selected to compete in the 1970 Holiday Fes—l

tioal basketball tournament in Madison Square Garden. The other
teams in the tourney will be Providence, St. Iohn’s, Western Ken-
tucky, St. Josephs, Holy Cross, Manhattan, South Carolina, and
Cornell.

If they played tomorrow, Pitt couldn’t beat any of those
teams. Does this mean that the Athletic Department has
committed itself to improving its basketball program? Or
does it mean that instead of scoring 42 points in front of
639 people, Pitt will pour in 42 points with 20,639 people
watching?

Whatever the correct answer, there is one thing for
certain. Whenever a team consistently loses, it’s easier to
blame the coach than to blame his 12 players. For this
reason, coach Bob Timmons is in trouble. And he knows it.

Last night, he shouted instructions to his players on
the court; he frequently called players over to the bench
for personal instruction; and he even jumped onto the
court to protest a few of the officials’ calls. These actions
are not usually part of Timmons’ coaching behavior. And
because they aren’t, most fans have been severely critical
of him.

Now that Penn State has relieved basketball coach
John Egli of his duties for next season, it’s obvious that
Pitt will be forced to put Timmons under scrutiny as this
season progresses. But the case for ﬁring Timmons (_h1S
teams have won 22 of their last 82) is not black and white.

On the plus side, Timmons is well—liked. He’s the PTO-
verbial “nice guy.” He will never publicly criticize_any of
his ballplayers nor will he knock opponents for any brash
tactics. He’s been head coach here since 1953 and no one
can question his knowledge of basketball-

But people are questioning his use of that knowledge.
The pi'o-Timmons Voice would say that he doesn’t have the
players to execute prope1‘ly- The ‘cmlifrimmons V3106 W111
counter than he doesn’t have the ability to “uﬁ-1'8 up 3 ball‘
club, and more importantly, he lacks the ability to recruit
one.

It is on the latter point that Timmons is most vulner-
able. Although his supporters can argue that the entire
program is weak and unattractive, the fact remains that

Timmons is the head of that program. And consider this.

Cagers Inept (26%) Shooting
Must Improve When 

' ‘V ' O .
Invades Tomorrow Night .
‘ by MIKE BROURMAN . « '
- Assistant Sports Editor . t b
With their modest two game win streak now by the
boards, the Panthers will try to start a new skein tomorro“
night when they entertain traditional rival Carnegie-Mellon:

at the Field House at 8:15 p.m.

Miami’ of Ohio trounced the cagers, 66-42, at the Field Hours
last night to break the streak. The Panthers terrible shooting (26:
per cent) combined with some ineptn-ess by the Redmen  .

Miami coach '1‘ates Locke to sar-
ca-stically comment that “the
game was about as exciting as
wa-tching grass grow on a ﬁeil-d."

Actually, Locke credited the
Panthers’ defense with causing
some of his team's troubles.
“Their zone really bothered us.

‘Those young kids of theirs play-

ed it real Well.” The oagers held
Fred Foster, the eighth leading
scorer in the nation, to 16 points,
his lowest output of the year.
Panther coach Bob Timmons
was also pleased with team’s de-
fense . . . in the first half. “In
the second half we weren’t mov-
ing as fast to cover them,” he
commented. Miami made a half
dozen easy layups to break open

Ken Bollens ponders advice from Timmons.

Coach Needs A Cigar

Little Dukes Clobb-er Cubs, 86-59

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

Duquesne freshman bas-
ketball coach Al Bailey
seems to have most of the
qualities that made former Bos-
ton Celtic coach Red Auerbach
famous. All he lacks are a few
cigars.

Auerbach had a reputation for
constantly jumping off the bench
to yell, and Bailey manages to
make his presence felt in the
same Way. And in doing so,
Bailey succeeded in getting al-
most everyone in the crowd to
hate him. He yelled at the ref-
erees, the official scorers, and
even at his own Players.

But just as Auerbach used to
come out the winning coach, so

The win was the eighth for
the Duquesne frosh in as many
games. And with the kind of
schedule they have bee :1 play-
ing, their winning streak does-
n't appear to be in jeopardy.

Last night's game against the
Cubs was one-sided from the
very beginning, as the Little
Dukes jumped off to a 13-2 lead
that they never lost. But fresh-
man basketball coach Tim Grgu-
rich didn’t think the score rep-
resented the true difference be-
twen his club and Bailey's frosh
ream.

“We’re not 27 points worse
than Duquesne,” explained Grgu-
rich. “We did a couple of things
that we couldn’t afford to ‘do
and we'll just have to work on

the contest after leading by only
28-22 at the half. L

But, it was the cagers’ shoot-.
ing, not defense, that caused the
loss. “You can’t ask. for better
shots than we had,” Timmons
said. “We just couldn’t put -the
ball in the hol-e. Aside from Mc-
Farland and K-alata, we just
didn’t hit.

Rob McFarland, who has been
scoring well lately, led the Pan-
thers with 15 points, while Len:
Kalata, a late substitute, had
eight. Phil Snow, a 5’8” guardi
was the game's leading scorer
with 19 points; mos-t of them on
long jumpshots. ’

“Snow’s a great shooter,” -
Locke said. “He had penumonia’
last month and that really hurt
our record (6-8). We lost a lot
of close ones _where he could’
have made the difference.” A V 1

Snow and Foster both scored
most of their points during Mi-*
ami’s second half surge. “We
were just out of it in the sec-
ond half,” said Timmons. “We
man’ou.t of gas.”

The Panthers’ exhaustion led
to those many easy layups, ac-
cording to Timmons. “We had

- to gamble .-agalinst them; to , go

for the ball. When we got tired,5
we didn’t get it.” V 2,
Timmons expects to startgthel
same lineup against Carnegie-
Mellon, despite the fact that
only one starter, McFarland, hit
double ﬁgures. However, as Tim-
mons noted, when he went to J
the bench there was no, improve- ,
ment. Aside from Kalata’s eight,
the rest of the reserves scored
the anemic total of two points;
Miami also trounced .th-e Pan- j
the-rs off the boards, but this
‘should not be the case against
the Tartans tomorrow. Mark ,
Lang is the only CMU starter’
ov-er 6'4”. The cagers should .

shooting night. Duquesne has
6-9 twins in Gary and Barry Nel-

they were there for the rebound.-

“We didn't make many‘ mis- ,

Another thing the Cub-s could-

Grgurich, “but you have to plat

DICK SIIILDT: more comfortable at 130 pounds.

Weight Class Shift May Help
Shilt Share Eastern Crown

by ROY JACOBS

Imagine, Pitt has a sports
star, and people can’t even
spell his name. Everywhere
Dick Shildt turns (except in The
Pitt News) his name is spelled
with a “c” that really isn't there.

For a tempermental star, this
type of treatment is unbearable,
but Dick is too busy wrestling
to worry about how people spell
his name. A senior, he moved
up a weight class to 130 this sea-
son after two years as the var-
sity 123 pounder. He’s only lost
once in six bouts.

“It’-s actually easier on me this
way,” reported Shiildt. “I can
work harder all week long once

“Wrestler” Chris Price Aims For

What happens when you take one high school wrest-
ler, who hasn’t been recruited for any university sport and

must learn a ‘brand new sport under four different coaches?
The answer is that he becomes a recordasetter and co-captain

of his team. The “ihe” is senior
Chris Price of the varsity team.

Chris is the number one man
in the 200-yard breaststroke and
the 200-ylard individual medley.
Last Saturday he set new pool
records for these events at Penn
State. With the season about
half over, he is already begin-
ning to eye a possible trip to
Princeton for the Easterns. Be-
«hind all of this success has been
a great deal of hard work and
determination.

Chris came to the University
from -a high school in Tennessee
which had neither a swimming
team nor a pool. He was spot-
ted in gym class by then fresh-
man coach Rob Levine who ask-
ed him to come out for the
swimming team.

“Levine started me out on the
right road,” said Chris. “He
‘rtaught me the fundamentals and
(helped drop my breaststroke
time by eight seconds.” From
Levine, he went onto the tutilege
of Ben Grady, Jerry Snyd-er, and
present coach Bill Grant. To
Grady, Chris feels he owes lit-
tle, but to Snyder_he owes al-

. most everything.

“Coach Snyder was the ﬁrst
coach who I ever felt that I

V wanted to swim for. Instead of

swimrning for myself and the
team, I was swimming for h;irn,”
“He got me a scholarship in my
junior year, but more impor-
tant, he inspired me and pushed

fruits of his labor.

Chris has set three goals which
he hopes to reach this season,
which will probably be his last
year of competitive swimming
in his short career. His number
one goal is to represent Pitt in
the Easterns. He says, “This
will probably be the biggest
thrill in sports for me. It’s my
last chance for the Easterns and
for me to really show some-
thing.”

The other goals tor this sea-
son are setting a school record
for the 200-yard breaststroke
and being the captain of a win-
ning swimming team.

Chris likes the breaststroke
best, but feels prouder of his
accomplislimeints in the individ-
ual medley. “The breaststroke
‘is my best event and will be my
meal ticket tor the Easterns,”
he explained. “But the medley
gives me my greatest personal
satisfaction. It’s the true swim-
mers event. In the medley the
swimmer can show how he has
mastered all the strokes and do-
ing this is a great accomplish-
men-t.”

Even though he has been on
«losing teams since he came here,
Chris Price doesn't feel like one
and he sums up his three and
=one-half years with, “Personal-
ly, I’ve been a winner in many
ways.”

CHRIS PRICE, swimming
team’s cocaptain, would like a.

I cut my weight down. At 123 it
was a struggle all week l-ong.

“Besides,” he added, “the team
looks strongest this way.” This
way refers to Bruce Unangst at
123 and Larry Cuba, who wrest-
led 130 last season, at 137.

The trio wrestling the ﬁrst
three matches is 11-2-1 on the
season. To Shildt, at least, wrest-
ling at the start of the month
makes a difference. His only
loss, at Navy, came whe-n the or-
der of matches was’ reversed.

“When we tried it at Navy, I
deﬁniitely didn't like it,” said
Shildt. “I like to get built up in-
side, and get it over with right
away. It sort of depends on the
tea.m——4if the guys going ahead
of you do well, then you tend to
do well; if they’re sloppy, you
tend to be ;s1o~ppy.

“The three of us can make a
difference,” he continued. “Since
Navy, we’ve won six straight
bouts. There’s just something
missing in those higher weights.
They come so close; it's just
those little mistakes.

“I think you would definlit-ely
see a difference if we 10s.”

But Shildt hasn't been rlosirng.
Coach Dave Adams has referred
to him as the team's most con-
sistent wrestler. His only lost
came at Navy, a 4-2 decision, and
this ﬂ'1‘l;lgih'.t be partially attri-
buted to the reversed wrestling,
order. Sh«ild’t match was next
to last.

“If the previous matchesh ave
gone slowly,” Shildt explained,
“and stalling has been called,

it's likely to be called more

quicky in the later matches.

“The Way I wrestle, -it looks
like I'm stalling when I’m try-
ing to set up a -takedown be-
cause I move backwards,” Shildt
added. “I guess it looked like I
was stalling, and they gave the
other guy one point. The other
point for riding time.”

Naturally, thoughts turned to
a chance for revenge in the East-
erns. Shildt expressed a hope to
even the score with Navy, but
he added that beﬂore then he
has to face some stiff competi-
tion.

“The boy I’m wrestling at
Michigan Saturday has already
beaten the national champion,”
he began. “The boy at Penn
State has beaten me three times,
and the boy at Lehigh tied me
last year.”

Last year the matmen scored
-2 points in the E‘astern.s. Shildt
offered some good reasons why
Dave Adams’ squad will do bet-
ter.

“This is the ‘best shape the
team has been in in my four
years,” he analyzed. “Tihery’re
more aggressive, and they’ve
learned so much more. The team
spirit has increased 100 per cent,
and I think this is largely due
to the coaches’ personalities.
Both of them know and love
the s-port. And it I'l.lJbS ‘oﬁ:'.”

Dick Shildt knows the sport,
too. And, if he can get [past
Penn State’-.s Wally Clark, he'll
be an Eastern champ. At least
then——mayvbe-pe«o»ple will learn
to spell his name right.

Shidemantle Aims to Regain

Eastern Longhorse Crown

by CHUCK DWORAK
Injuries and hard work
have marked the outstand-

ing gymnastics career of
David Shidemantle. Long hours
of practice in the gym on his
longhorse, trampoline, and floor
exercise routines lllaVe given the
ﬁve foot eight inch, 150 pound
senior ace attractive sets of hi.
ceps on both arms.

They have also given him a
broken foot, a torn thigh mus-
cle, a dislocated elbow, and a
championship in the 1966 East-
ern Gymnlasltlics Chambpio-nship
meets, followed by a. ﬁfth place
ﬁnish in the natlional ch.alm~p»ion-
ships. Healthy again, he is a
good bet to make the Ealsterns
again this year on the long-
horse and ﬂoor exercise. _

Shidem-antle began his gym-I
nastics career in -tenth gnade at
Butler (Pa.) High. He worked
on the trampoline and did some
tumbling that year. In his jun-
ior andsenior high school years,
Shidei-mantle began working on
his specialities, the lorighonse and
ﬂoor exercise. “I wo-rked in the
gym two to three hours la day
on my events then,” said S-hide-
mantle, “and I also worked out
an hour a day outside the gym.
I have continued pracltlicing that
away since.”

In his first season here, Shide-
mantle dislocated an elbow in
the second meet of the season
and missed -every meet after that
except the ﬁnal one. In the East-
erns that year he was elimin-
ated in the semiﬁnal round-on
the ﬂoor exercise but won the
championship on the longhorse.

tle’s only injury-free ‘season. “I
have to call this my best sea-
son,” he said. ‘‘I have made
every meet on the lonlglholrlse,
ﬂoor «exercise, and trampoline.”
He has won the lonsghorse event
seven times in eight meets this
season with an averlazge of 9.3,

Linguist Analyzes Thai Wars,

Political Evolution After Visit

by DIANE McDONALD

“My talk will have no so-
cial significance,” confided
Dr. Edward Anthony, mem-
ber of the University’s lin-
guistics dept. ‘.‘It’s only fair
to tell you that my know-
ledge of Thailand is very spe-
cialized.”

In a lecture given to East A.s-i-
an Club and linguist-ics depart-
ment members, Dr. Anthony
summarized h-is recent trip to
Thai-1Ia.nd, made while working
and teaching under the auspicies
of the ‘US State Department and
a Rockefeller grant.

J uxtaposing ancient and pre-
sent history, Anthony brieﬂy de-
scribed the political evolution of

the Thai. In the beginning . . .

“Groups of Thai foughrt. each
other, the Burmese, and any-
body else who happened to be
around.” Siam’:s government was
sprinkled liberally with domi-
neering monks--turned-kings, no-
ble ﬁamilies and a ravaging in-
vasion by Kubla Khan.

But absolute monarchy went
out with the year 1932, and the
present king, Rama IX, is a
nominal, though popular, ruler
of two and one half million Thai.
Most of the power today is cen-

tered in the prime minister, two
deputies, and diverse ministries.

“There are a lot of domino-
players in Southeast Asia,” stat-
ed Anthony, “and I didn’t see
any doves there.” A November
editorial titled “Terrorists in the
South” indicated that the Com-
munists there pose a threat
equal equal to that of their
Northera-n comrades. Thailand,
nestled among Red-tinted Cam-
bodia, Laos, and Burma, has a
budding Communist party of 5,-
000 active members.

Living in Bangkok, in his ca-
p a cit y as English - 1ingui.stics
teacher, Anthony found the Thai
“the most obiiging and hospit-
able people I’ve ever met any-
where in the world.” The Siam
of Yul Brynner-Deborah Kerr
fame has given way to a modern
Thlailand of haggling tax\i-driv-
ers, waster-skiing, and supermar-
kets stocked with squid, baskets
of small birds roasted wh-ole,
and “viarious suspicious fruits.”
Mongoose, birds, and other gen-
tle household pets such as
snakes and Siamese ﬁghiting
ﬁsh are sold.

The standard of living, elevat-
ed in part by an‘ insurgence of
Americans, sustains expensive

Dow Chemical Leading
Cause For University
Student Demonstration

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (CPS)——Dow Chemical Com-
pany recruiting was by far the leading cause of student
demonstrations this fall, according to a study done by the
National Student Association (NSA).

The NSA study said there were 27 demonstrations in
which the presence of a Dow recruiter ‘was the cause. Re-
cruiting by the armed forces was a distant second, causing
eight demonstrations, f‘ollowed by recruiting by other gov-
ernment agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency

Mass. College Revamps
Cumulative Grade Setup

NORTH EA.STON, Mass. (IP)
—Many educators are concerned
that collegiate pressures often
operate to inhibit student motiva-
tion and intellectual curiosity.
With most colleges cons'isten>tlly
raising standards, a students of-
ten feels the stress and becomes
“graduation+a:verage conscioues.”

As a result he tends to play it
safe, takes no ex*pe~ri.menta1
-courses, sticks to familiar sunb-
ject ﬁelds and may fret through-
-out his whole college career be-
-cause of low grad-es received
during his freshman adjustment
-to college--level work.

Sltonehill College hopes to
solve these prevalent proibllems
through a new grading system
recently ad_opted by a joint fac-
ulrty-student committee at the
college.

The major feature of the new
system provides that freshman
grades are not included in the
overall graduation average. The
