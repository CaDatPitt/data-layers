  State Senate Ready To Pass Appropriations For Pitt

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

,. The State. Senate late last night

'was on the verge of approving a
seven percent appropriation in-
crease for Pitt, along with the
appropriations of the three other
state related universities—Lincoln,
Penn State and Temple.

The Senate version of the bill is

identical to the bill already passed
by the state house appropriating
some $67,588 million to the
university.
V Gov/ernor Thornburgh’s pro-
posed budget calls for only a ﬁve
percent appropriation increase for
Pitt. The House attached a rider to
its bill stating that the two percent
increase (over the governor’s
budget is to be used to hold down
tuition costs.

Ed Bozak, assistant chancellor,
is pleased with the anticipated
seven percent increase.

“I think it is a favorable
reﬂection in Harrisburg for the ﬁrst
time in several years,” Bozik said.

The state legislature has done all
they could to assure Pitt of its
needed appropriations increase, he
added.

If the,Senate passes the seven
percent appropriation increase and

lathe bill is signed by ‘the governor,

most Pitt ‘students will pay $65
more per term than last year.

For ﬁscal year 1980,. a Pitt
undergraduate in the College of
Arts and Sciences will pay $1,590
per year in tuition compared _to
$1,460 per year during ﬁscal year
1979. '

On June 12, the Board of
trustees approved two contingency
budgets for the university based on

whether Pitt received a ﬁve or
seven percent budget increase.

If the Thomburgh budget had

,been approved, Pitt students would

pay $85 more per term than last
year, according to the contingency
plans. 9

Pitt’s tuition has been increased

by the trustees five times ‘since
1976. A ' ,
The approval by the trustees of a
tuition increase caused some
controversy through the protests of
the Student Government Board.

The SGB unanimously endorsed
a resolution calling for the Board of

Trustees to hold an advertised,

public meeting “open to all Pitt
students” to discuss the need and
implications of the pending tuition
hike. “"’ ' -

The Group Against Smog and Pollution (GASP) has
launched a membership drive here with the hopes of
involving members of the university community in the
group’s anti-pollution drive. -

staff recommended. the four ﬁnalists after two months of

involved in the ﬁght for clean air,” according to Teresa
Mancuso, a spokesperson for GASP.

The membership drive, called “Do You Care for Clean
Water and Air?,” is part of a long range plan to celebrate
GASP’s tenth anniversary this fall, Mancuso said.

“A major celebration will be held in October to call
attention to the organization’s accomplishments over a
period of ten difficult and often controversial years, and to
highlight environmental objectives for the eighties,” a
GASP press release said. 7

The group was organized in 1969 to help “lessen
pollution in highly industrial Allegheny County, where
dirty air and .water were accepted as "The price for
employment”, according to the release.

Among the-industries monitored by GASP, is the steel
industry, which is supposed to implement state and federal
clean air and water regulations, according to Mancuso.

“We are always checking to make sure they (the steel
companies) are going to do what they are required to do,”
Mancuso added. .

The original goals of Gasp, according..to Mancuso, are
that “people have the right to clean air, pure water and to
the preservation of the natural, scenic historic and
aesthetic values of the environment.

What the group needs, she said, are people to work in
public relations, fund raising activities, and other areas
which a university can provide expertise in.

Titusville
Campus To

Stay Open

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer
As a result of a meeting between
Pitt administrators, state legis-
lators and members of the

community, the university’s Titus- »

ville campus will remain open
pending further study by a joint
planning committee.

Earlier this year, the university
staff had proposed to close the
campus at the end of the 1981
academic year because of projected
ﬁnancial and enrollment problems
in the 1980’s. ‘

The joint planning committee
will study the educational needs of
the Titusville area, suggest alter-

«natives for meeting those needs,
and at the same time, address the -

university’s enrollment and finan-
cial problems, according to Robert
Nossen, associate provost for
regional campuses.

One of ‘the alternatives for
meeting the area's educational
needs is the development of a
community college. Pitt, however,

cannot establish the school, they,
can only suggest its development,

Nossen said.

“A community college can only A9
be established by a taxing authority  a

(like a city or county)—in no way
will Pitt establish it,” Nossen said.

Another result of the meeting
was an agreement by Secretary of
Education Robert Scanlon, author-
izing the construction of a new $2.1
million student union/ gymnasium
at the Titusville campus.

The university had suspended

plans for building the facility until 1
the future of the Titusville campus ,

was determined.

It will be the state, not Pitt
students, who will foot the bill for
the new building, Nossen said.

“The decision to build is the
state's decision, not Pitt,’ s,’’ be
added. . -

Nossen said it is difﬁcult to
determine what programs should
be cut to reduce costs and keep
down tuition and “it's inevitable
that both good and bad things get
cut.”

Titusville is the smallest of the
regional campuses in te_rms of
enrollment; it depends largely on

Allegheny county for its student _

population instead of students from

its own region, and there are.

eleven other institutions in the
northwestern Pennsylvania area,
according to Nossen.

For those reasons, Nossen
added, Titusville is the logical
place to make cuts to save money
for the university.

Task Force Head Predicts Skylab’s Final Destination

By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON-Skylab’s 1,855-
day career as an orbiting laboratory
and them as a space derelict comes

to a shattering end Wednesday, its ,

‘remains destined to ~ plunge nearly

unobserved into ‘the briny deep of g«_ 

the south Atlantic. 1

“We’d like to see those
predictions stay,” said Richard G. °
Smith, head of the Skylab Task
Force as he talked about a ﬁnal '
orbit that would take Skylab and its
debris only over water.

The North American Air Defense
Command, which tracks. the 77%-
ton hulk on its 16 daily trips around
Earth, said Tuesday that Skylab
will fall between 7:02 a.m. and 5:02
p.m., EDT.

If Skylab crashes at the
mid-point of that prediction it
would splash into the Atlantic near
the Equator off Africa’s Ivory
Coast. Its debris would scatter-
from that point forward, the
heaviest going all the way into the
Indian Ocean.

The 10-hour prediction period

embraces nearly seven prbits, all of
them passing over the United
States at some point. On those
seven orbits, Skylab also will pass
over 4 South America, Africa and
Australia, effectively eliminating

danger of falling debris, Smith.
said.

Policemen Receive Minor Injuries

ERIE,,3Pa.—Five Erie policemen have been treated
for minor injuries stemming from three separate

incidents.

The officers were taken to Saint Vincent Health
Center in Erie following each incident.

Police said two ofﬁcers were injured late Monday
during an alleged disturbance in Erie.

Police said

Harold Walker, 51, of Erie was arraigned on charges
of disorderly conduct, aggravated assault and battery

on a police officer and resisting arrest.
He was released on a $5,000 bond.

Man Falls From Boat, Drowns

MERCER, Pa.—A 54-year-old Crawford County
man drowned after falling from his boat into Lake

Monday.

Wilhelm, about 17 miles north of Mercer, authorities

said.

State police identified the victim as Theodore

fisherman.

Cribbs of Meadville. He was dead at the scene

Police say his body was discovered by other

burning somewhere over the
Pacific or the Northwest United
States and Canada.

But it will be daylight in the
Western Hemisphere and the
ﬂaming satellite will not be visible.

Smith said that if the predicted

time frame, is_ accurate the"

splashdown would be “at regular
banking hours if we’re lucky.’’ ‘

Twenty-four hours before the
predicted splashdown time Skylab
was orbiting at 107 miles. That’s a
drop of more than 10 miles in 24
hours. '

When Skylab hits the 100-mile
point, the tube-shaped craft will
begin to glow from the heat of
re-entry. At about 70 miles it will
begin to break apart.

Ten pieces weighing more than a
half ton are expected to be among
the 500, pieces that survive the
ﬂaming re-entry.

NASA has teams standing by to
rush anywhere on the globe if there
are reports of damage or injury and
the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion was prepared to warn
airplanes out of Skylab’s track in
the last few hours.

Smith said that it looked as if no
maneuver would be needed to keep
Skylab in orbit longer. The orbits
covered by the 10-hour predicted
span are mostly over water.

“I wish I could answer we héu
done ‘something. The truth is we
have not,” Smith said when a
reporter asked whether the final
orbits were just pure luck.

Smith said that he “seriously
questions” whether the actual

. breakup of Skylab will show on

radar screens. “Hopefully, near
the time the debris is coming down,
we’ll know it,” he said.

Engineers will cause Skylab to
tumble end over end when it _,
reaches an altitude of 86 miles to ’
better be able to predict the
breakup. Smith said that tumbling
might add 15 to 20 minutes to
Skylab’s life and put it farther
down the South Atlantic or into the
Indian Ocean- . ‘

On the odds that Skylab pieces
will strike land, hesaid:

“I don't have an estimate on
that. We are still talking about
some tracks that go over consider-
able amounts of land."

Smith would not rule out that the
last pieces of debris might hit west
central Australia.

But he said of the middle orbit:
“From a population standpoint, it’s ,3
a very good orbit, one of the best.” i

Tracing the middle orbit on a
map, Smith said, “we are talking
about a water tack that starts off
Nova Scotia, goes all the way down
below South Africa. The ﬁrst land
is Australia, New Guinea slightly,
and a continuous water track north
to Vancouver.”

All along, NASA has cautioned
that the predictions are imprecise
because of different natural forces

-that work on Skylab. These include

variations in the gravitational pull
of land masses and oceans,
atmospheric friction and solar”
ﬂares, which heat up the atmos-2, _
phere and increase drag on a
satellite.

Even the ﬁnal prediction, which
will come two hours before the
expected re-entry, will be only 20
percent accurate, meaning that the
station could come down anywhere
over a 15,000 mile path.

The debris will fall over an area
100 miles wide‘ and 4,000 miles
long. '

Iron City Remains PittsburghSteelworkers’ Favorite   

Moments afterthe whistle blows ‘

at the Jones  Laughlin mill on the
city’s South Side, steelworkers
belly up to the bar at Matesic’s
tavern and order—what else?——a
shot and a beer.

And mostly the beer is—what
else?—’Iron City.

“I think it’s tradition,” said

‘owner Barbara Matesic, who taps

a barrel of Iron City every day.
“With the guys at the mill, it’s
handed down from father to son.”

“We all drink Iron most of the
time,” said retired millworker Ed-
die Gates, who drinks his beer with
a glass of gin. “Some people drink
Millers. Some people drink

_ Strohs. Me, I like Iron City. That

will always be my beer. It’s got
more robust to it, more oomph.”

But ‘ despite such Iron City
strongholds as Matesic’s, sales in
Pittsburgh dropped in the last 10
years,‘ particularly for its bitter-
tasting lager. National brands
picked up the slack.

Pittsburgh Brewing Co., the
maker of Iron City, last reported a
profit in 1972. And for the first six
months of this year, W it lost
$2l4,076—a bleak statistic with a
bright spot. Sales increased by 7
percent» compared with the same

period in‘1978 and losses were cut
by more than 50 percent.

“We think we’re doing the right
things,” said PBC President
William Smith. “We’re getting
people to come back and drink the
Iron City product.”

Smith was named president of
the firm nearly a year ago. Since
then he has tried to strengthen Iron
City’s traditional western Penn-
sylvania market and expand to new
areas.

“The brewing industry has been
going through a severe change in
the last couple years,” Smith said.
“Iron City slipped. We've lost 12
to 14 percent of our volume in the
last three years. Ilwould say now
that’s coming back.’ ’

Because of heavy competition
and inflation, there are now under
50 regional breweries left in the

U.S., compared with the 735
operating shortly after the
Prohibition.

Some market analysts estimate

In the nation’s top four brewers-

Anhewser-Busch, Pabst, Miller
and Schlitz—now account for
about 70 percent of the beer sold in
the U.S.

“Iron City used to comprise 60
percent of my sales.
maybe 25 percent,” said, Charles

Now its V

Rogers, a Pittsburgh distributor. “

“Ten years ago, I was selling 30
cases of Millers a month and I

v didn’t sell one case of Strohs.

Now I sell 300 to 400 casesgof
Strohs and Millers each day.”

To remain competitive, Iron
City introduced a light beer and
supplies private label beer to
distributors and chains in Ohio, St.
Louis, Chicago and eastern Pen-
nsylvania. V

It’s also test-marketing Rose-
Ale a ' flavored carbonated
product, and is developing a non-
alcoholic beverage for the Arabian
market, called “American Beer.”

In Pittsburgh, Smith is hoping
the brisk-selling light beer and a
series of locally-made television
commercials will bring back some
of the lost volume.

“Our current theme is to pump
iron,” said Smith, who stars in
some ‘of the advertisements.
“We’re asking the public not to
buy a beer because it’s imported or
one that says it’s for weekends.
Wewant them to try a beer that’s

~ just for drinking-Iron City. We

tell them it’s made right here in
town.”

Because it’s made in Pittsburgh,
Iron City has a following among
some people who like to spend

..

their money where they make it.

“Why do‘ I drink Iron City?
I like it,” said Bill Salopek, who
guzzled a beer in Matesic’s while
his wife waited in an idling car.

“I work across the street. If I’m
gonna drink beer, I might as well
drink Iron City, just like I’d rather
the people buy J & L products in-
stead of Japanese stuff.”

“If I felt that way, I’d be
drinking a beer I didn’t like,” said
Jack Baxendill, a truck driver nur-
sing a bottle of Strohs. ‘It’s a
matter of taste. I think Iron City is
too bitter. It’s tangy.”

 

Pittsburgh ’s Supersteelers — Yet To Reach Greatness

PITTSBURGH AP—Pittsburgh Steeler
coach Noll said Tuesday his team didn’t
peak when it won its third Super Bowl in
January and probably wouldn't reach full
potential this season.

“Our biggest problem is things are too
good. We hope it stays that way,” Noll
said at the team’s first press conference

since the 1978 National Football League

championship. game in Miami.

The Steelers open this year's training

“First of all we want to evaluate their
physical capabilities,” said Noll. “We
contemplate no real changes for the
veterans. For the rookies, we’ll look at
them and see what happens.”

The Steelers are ripe with veterans:
22 of them played in the team’s first
Super Bowl win against vMinnesota after

‘‘I’m not necessarily interested in any

But’ Noll said this season won’t be a
cake walk for the veterans, who’ll
compete for starting spots with 34 eager
rookies—l5 draft choices, 19 free’
agents-and a host of maturing backup
players.

“We’re going to play as many people
as can make a contribution to our football
team,” Noll said. “We’ve got some good
young people coming to camp. We’re
excited about what they’re doing.”

Nell said Bradshaw, named Most
Valuable Player in the Super Bowl and
the Associated Pres MVP, is the best
quarterback playing the game today.

“We’ve always felt he had the

capability to be the best, and it was yet to

“We’ll put him in, give him equal work
and see how it goes, how he holds up

“You find a spot for the best people. You
keep the 45 best.”

Noll said his biggest concern is the
competition. ‘

“Houstoﬁ’s going to’ be tough” he
said. “Cincinnati came on very strong at
