School Gets

Underway

The Graduate School of Public
Health opened on Monday in its
quarters in the Municipal Hospital.

Two years in the planning, the
school offers courses leading to
M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, as well as
courses leading to master of public
health and doctor of public health.
It has been fully accredited by the
American Public Health Associatioh.

The school was financed by a
‘$13.5 million gift from the A.W.
Mellon Educational and Charitable
Trust, with additional research
grants from the Atomic Energy Com-
mission, the National Foundation
Infantile Paralysis, the Army
Epidemilogical Board, and the Nat-
ional Security Resources Board.

Enrollment Limited
Student enrollment for the first

. year has been limited to 30. Thus
_ far, 29 have enrolled.

Of the 29, nine are from the
Pittsburgh area, three from else-
where in Pennsylvania, nine from
out of the state, and eight from
foreign countries.

Students of the school represent
a wide variety of professional back-
grounds and career interests in
public health, including administra-
tion occupational or industrial health,
hospital administration, epidemi-
ology, microbiology, and biostatis-
tics.

The school’s curriculum will be the
complete responsibility of a full
time faculty, according to Dr. Thomas
Parran, dean of the school.

Large Faculty

The faculty now includes 10 pro-
fessors, two associate professors,
one assistant professor, and seven
research associates. Faculty mem-
bers in the medical school and
other units of the University will
assist, added Dr. Parran.

Students will receive training in
a model health district in the Ar-
senal area of Pittsburgh in addition
to classroom training. The district
is being created through the coopera-
tion of the City of Pittsburgh Depart-
ment of Health and the U.S. Public
Health Service.

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
and Dr. Parran welcomed the stu-
dents in a brief ceremony before
classes began Monday.

MC Store
Sales Good

The demand for used books at
the Men’s Council Used Bookstore
is exceeding the supply, reports
manager Ronald Ecker, especially
for freshman course books.

The eighth floor store, operated
by Men’s Council for the exchange
of used textbooks, is putting out
a call for such books as Perrin’s
Guide and Index to English, and
first-year science course books.
Books will be sold at the price asked
by the student.

Texts for most of the courses
still using the same book are avail-
able for sale at the store, Ecker
advises. Books may be bought or sold
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Students sell-
ing books receive a receipt which
will be exchanged for cash after
the book is sold.

Council deducts a small percent-
age of the sale price as a fund for
carrying on student activities.

“Pl1Ys Ed for All"--Hamilton 

Athletic Head Asks

Hour-a-day Program A.

End of the freshman year will not mean the end of physical
education for men students, if a proposal submitted by Capt. Tom
Hamilton, director of athletics, to the University Board of Deans

is adopted.

Capt. Hamilton’s plan calls
physical education classes one hour
each day, five days a week.

-The athletic director’s proposal
was submitted in compliance with a
request by Chancellor Rufus H.
Fitzgerald for recommendations
aimed at integrating the University
in a possible war effort.

Increased emphasis on physical
education is, according to Captain

Hamilton, a necessity in view of
imminent drafting of men students

into the armed services where top
‘physical condition is of basic im-

portance.
Inadequate At Present
The present phys ed program,

which calls for two hours per day
during the freshman year, falls far
short of adequacy, considering pre-
sent world conditions, the Captain
feels.

“The majority of schools have
compulsory physical education in
both the freshman and sophomore
years,” said Capt. Hamilton.

The athletic director admits
that approval of his proposal would
present “serious difficulties” to
the physical education staff, be-
cause of the marked inadequacy of
present facilities.

However, Capt. Hamilton insists
that a program far superior to the
present one in the number of stu-
dents handled can be worked out,
especially with the completion of
the new field house.

As far as the Captain is con-
cerned, the University’s program of
physical education is inadequate
even to the needs of peacetime.
“We are not turning out particularly
well-equipped students physically,”
he said.

Stand Clarified

"I want to make clear that we
are not trying to cram an unwanted
program down anyone’s throat. But a
University’s purpose is to provide
the student with a better foundation
on which to build his future life.
And this foundation should be phys-
ical as well as mental,”

The athletic director relates that
he was struck by the inferiority of
the physical education program im-
mediately on his arrival here almost
two years ago.

“The program is inferior not from
a lack of competent staff,” he said,
"but from inadequate time allot-
ment and facilities.

"has been reserved for the trip, spon-

crease.”

He added that the drop in full
time veterans has had some in-
fluence on enrollment, but that the
extent has not been determined at
this time.

A breakdown of the figures made
last Saturday in the dean of men’s
office showed at least 2463 full
time students under the (3.1. Bill.
Mr. Saalbach said that when the
figures are brought up to date there
will be roughly as many part time
as full time veterans.

Commenting on the number of

 

Early Registration Reports
Indicate Enrollment Drop

Although complete registration figures have not yet been
tallied, Pitt’s enrollment is showing a decline.

].G. Quick, registrar, related, "From preliminary checks it is
evident that the classified student group (including freshmen,
sophomores, juniors, and seniors) has been effected by the de-

students studying under the G.I.
Bill of Rights, William Saalbach,
assistant to the dean of men, said
there had been a considerable drop.
He said he expected approximately
5500 G.I. Bill students in the Uni-
versity. This figure is exclusive of
those veterans in the School of
Pharmacy, and Johnstown and Ells-
worth Centers.

Mr. Saalbach estimated asubstan-
tial drop in full time veteran stu-
dents. He added, however, that
there would probably be more part

. time veterans than in former years.

{Nurses Home Building,
“Field House Accelerated

Groundbreaking ceremonies on Oct. 12 at the Site Of the PTO‘
g posed Nursing Home will move construction along another step
0 in the multi-million dollar Pitt medical center developement. The

 ‘contract for the building was recently let to the Trimble Co.

On another front in Pitt’s extensive expansion program, work

has started again on the field house

to be located behind Pitt Stadium.
Work was stalled throughout the
summerwhile financial andplanning

Vmdifficulties were ironed out. Now

University officials feel assured
that the enlarged and extended
structure will be ready for use by
next spring.

' Completion of the Nurses Home,

0' expected to fill one of the major

needs of the medical center as it
now stands, should be announced in
740 days if the present schedule
holds throughout the nearly two
years.

Work on the field house is the

-latest step in a short history which

has seen construction start and

4 , stop several times. Plans for the

structure have again been changed
by -the architects. this time for the

better as far as sports facilities go.

The newedition of the field house

~. will seat 7000 spectators at ath-

letic events and will in addition
provide ample office space for

. athletic department personnel. Large

locker room facilities have been
provided for in the new field house
concept.

As envisioned now the field
house is expected to cost in the
neighborhood of $1,300,000 but
according to University Bursar,
G. S. Rupp, cost of furnishing the

. building will run the end expendi-

ture up substantially.

On thefinancial side of the build-
ing program, a total of slightly over
$8,000,000 has been raised in a
building fund drive which started
out to raise $12,700,000. Recently
the General State Authority in Har-
risburg grarred $850,000 to the Uni-
versity to finish one wing of the
proposed Nurses Home.

finished by the end of December.
Commenting on the new wing, Mr.

 I Miss Rush Marks 30th Year

 In Dean of Women’s Office

From the old Heinz House on the hill to her present stone
and tapestry lined domain stretches a long and busy 30 years of
work in the dean of women's office. And according to Miss Helen
Pool Rush, "I have loved every minute of it.”

Miss Rush began her work under Thrysa W. Amos in 1920, as

'  Heinz

  
 

first assistant. Offices were in the
' House, and the present
Cathedral was still a dream.

Now, in her tenth year as dean
of women, Miss Rush is very en-
thusiastic about her job. Her feel-
ing that working with the girls is
the most important and challeng-
ing part of it is shown in her
Constant interest and participa-
tion in student affairs.

Her office is a good illustra-
tion of this interest. Its open arch-
ways invite many interruptions,
and during a twenty minute inter-
view, there were four telephone
calls, three lost freshmen, correct

 in dink and arm bands, a short

conference with two WSGA com’

 Kmittee chairmen, two notes from a

We-‘ note with relief that, judging
by the men’s Compass handbook,
the present freshman class is only
 half as ferocious as last year’s.
 Under the heading Pittiquette,
2 -_ the 1949 frosh was warned: "At
-' Pitt, ...you are under constant
p observation.” The illusion that
K this part of the handbook was writ-
ten for Western State Psychiatric
~inmates was not dispelled by fol-
-lowing paragraphs.

Witness: “In class-Be prompt,
attentive, gentlemanly, Act human,
keep your feet off the walls.”

,"In the halls, on walks and
lawns-Be friendly...”(Don’t bite
that teacher's leg when passing
him just because he gave you a D
on a quiz.) "Act human, keep your
A ‘feet off the walls.”

_ In the 1950 edition of the Com-

] Q: pass, the frosh are cautioned only

‘_ * once about keeping the walls free
‘ of footprints.

In the Head, Yet?

Daffynitions: Yawn: a hole made
by a bore. That’s awl, brother.

Here’s how to fix those people
you only faintly remember who
come up and ask what you did this
summer. Clamp an armlock on
them and tell them. Skip nothing.
That’ll fix their wagons.

Nothing could be duller to them
than stories about somebody else’s
vacation when they are bursting to
tell their own stories about Lake
Blank with its beautiful scenery,
especially the one who wore a
green bathing suit.

Rarefled Roach

Summertime dialogue in the Uni-
versity News Service office on
the thirty-third floor:

R Jane Shaw: “Oh, look at that

horrible old bug! How did he ever

get this far off the ground.”

Jane Davidson, the blond
science writer attached to the
News service while taking a mas-

‘a_ ter’s in zoology: "Why it's a roach‘.'
Calmly picking it’ up and peering
at it. "Yes, and a very young
roach, too. How on earth did he
get ‘way up here?”

The mysterious appearance of
bugs in this shining tower is still
a puzzle, but the moral of the
story is that the timid woman is a
dying race, men.

The male sex should have kept
for itself the privilege of not vot-
ing at election time.

Squwe Deal: 1950 Style

Duquesne students are more to
be pitied than censured. There's
just too much Bluff in all of them.
Like the one who took a weekend
trip with us to Geneva. After a
hearty meal, he leaned back and
breathed contentedly. "Ahh-h, my
appetite has subsidized.”

The search for the man of the
hour in these troubled times is
finished. It isn’t Gen. Marshall,
it isn’t Margiotti, it’s the guy
whose girl told him to wait a
minute, I'll be right down.

One of the more humorous pro-
fessors was reading his class a
short story. The description of one
of the female characters pictured
her as being dressed in a "tight
silk print.” The prof cautioned his
students “That's right silk print,
now, not silk print tights. There's
a difference you know.

Activities Report

The value of activities in education has been a hotly-debated
subject since the Golden Age of Greece, when students insisted
that throwing the javelin was just as important as learning the
Pythagorean theorem. Their instrdctors contended just as hotly
that entertainment and non-academic activity had no place in the
pursuit of learning. The argument is as yet unresolved.

perhaps the most constructive work done toward defining the
role of activities in the college student’s curriculum came out of
a series of conferences sponsored by the dean of men’s office
and participated in bya score of men students last spring. Printed
below is a condensed version of the report of the conferences,
together with a checklist for student activities.

Our purpose in printing this is to give wider circulation to
what appears to be a well-prepared outline for the organization
and management of Pitt student activities, as well as to define
the place of activities in the university curriculum. It should be
apparent that activities, as described here, are something more
than mere vehicles for the collection of keys.

* * =8 * * *

The ultimate purpose of any worthwhile student activity is
the betterment of the individualstudent - to assist in his develop-
ment and overalleducation. It must be remembered that activities
are an integral part of education and must not be considered as
"an added attraction;” they are means and not end objectives.

A worthwhile student activity should serve:

1. As a practical laboratory for solution of group problems
and group methods.
As a training ground in leadership and responsibility.
As a method in teaching the social techniques of living
and working with other.
As a medium for the creative impulse and a means of
developing special talents.
As recreation with worthwhile purposes.
As a means of broadening the student’s knowledge and
interest in vocational fields.

The value of activities as a facet of education is unmistak-
able, but a misdirected program may have harmful effects. Acti-
vities are harmful if they breed time wasters, snobs, demagogues
hypocrites, slackers, or key chasers. They miss their purpose if
they confuse expediency with democracy, machinery for purpose,
“busyness” for success, tradition with good, change with pro-
gress, popularity with character. They miss their purpose entirely
if their final aim is not the betterment of the individual students.

Realizing the purposes of activities and the responsibilities
which they have to their members, every activity representative
should strive toward the advancement of the activity program at
Pitt. A few suggested channels toward which groups might direct
their efforts are as ‘follows:

so that they may determine the quality of their particular
program in terms of all-campus objectives.

To popularize activities and develop better public rela-
tions and to dispel the connotation of glory seekers and
and key chasers which are generally attached to activity
men.

To strive for better Freshmen Orientation and to attempt to
establish then favorable orientation attitudes toward acti-
vities.

To attempt to enlist more freshmen students in the activity
program by establishing Freshmen groups in each activity
i.e. Freshmen Debate Squad, Freshmen Glee Club, etc.

2.

to prospective students the value of activities.

To attempt the achievement of a continuous orientation or
leadership program. ,

To develop greater spirit by the formation of groups pat-
terned after the Engineering and Mines Association, i.e. _a
College Club, a Bus Ad Club, etc., and develop class or-
ganizations. 1

To attempt surveys designed to reveal the reason for parti-
cip ation or non-p articip ation in student activities.

To attempt to give more recognition to worthy and respons-
sible positions, such as fraternity presidents.

To attempt to break down the physical barriers (separate

classes and block schedules) which keep certain segments of the__

student body isolated.

11. To attempt to interest more faculty people in the activities
program. I

12. To work for the establishment of a joint Student-Faculty
Committee which would meet regularly to provide a better medium
for the exchange of ideas and information.

These are just a few of the possible points of attack that can
be taken to improve the existing program. ‘Many more will become
apparent as work progresses in this field. _There is a danger, how-
ever, that groups will become so immersed in specific features of
the overall program that they lose sight of their end obligations
to the University, to other groups, and above all, the responsibil-
ity which it has in the development of the individual as a better
citizen.

B3’ WILL DOERGE
The Marine Corps must have it in for Pitt fullbacks. First they
called up for active duty Mike Omatick, who was slated to see defensive

duty this fall for the Panthers.
Then Paul Chess,Pitt’s top offen-
sive back, got his call from the
Marines. And now, it’s Big John
Huzvar who is leaving the ranks
of Pitt fullbacks to serve on active

- duty.

lluzvar got his orders to report
for induction at Camp Lejeune,
N.C., on Oct. 6. But it isn't going
to stop the Hershey sophomore
from playing against Duke on
Saturday.

Realizing that he might be
giving up a whole year of eligi-
bility, lluzvar insists on per-
forming against his old rival,
Duke.

John replaced regular Joe Capp
on the first team this week when
Capp suffered a sprained ankle in
practice.

The big 240-pounder has a grudge
of his own to settle with Duke. As
a freshman at North Carolina State
in 1947, he was the regular varsity
fullback. In the Wolfpacks’vgame
with Duke that year, he suffered a
knee injury as his team lost, 7-0,
and ever since, he has been plagued
with that injury. _

. His knee injuryis not expected
to keep him out of the Marines,

however.

In an effort to form this year's

since Monday of last week.

Thus far, no schedule has been
released on javvee activity this
fall, but several games are in the

otti Pushing for   Quarterback  

Ailing Arm Responding

To Careful Treatment

- By STAN SKIRBOLL
The delicate -- and ever important -- quarterback situation
took on a brighter look this week with the return of ailing Fred

Botti to scrimmage lineups.

Botti, who was billed to give Bob Bestwick a battle for the
first-string quarterback berth last spring, has been out of action

due to shoulder bursitis.

An operation on the shoulder in Tuly, and a two-month-~rest,

seems to have been the remedy,
for the big Uniontown product was
tossing. the pig-
skin in practiced,
with a high de- N A
gree of accuracy.
This news
should case some
of Head Coach‘
Len Casanova’s

offensive wor-
ries, and give
the vital posi-

tion some depth
and experience.

The addition of
the 24-year old college senior will
give the signal”-calling post added
maturity and experience. Botti has
an edge over the other quarterback
candidates in this respect.

Last week marked Botti’s first
attempt at passing since his opera-
tion. He had been under doctors’
ca're during the entire fall practice,
with orders not to throw any
passes.

B0 tti

Threw TD

During the past week, the 6-1,
195-pound quarterback started tos-
sing some long ones, and complet-
ed one aetial for a touchdown dur-
ing one of the scrimmages.

Although his arm is responding
well to treatments, Botti still must
take things easy, and give the un-
used shoulder muscles a chance to
respond. V

It’s been a long time since Botti
played his first game for the Pan-
thers. He was on the 1944 squad
before he left for the Navy.

Last year, Botti was used as a

Scoutmaster Geremsky
A   By MYRON KOPELMAN

Sports Editor

Dusk was falling -- a cool, almost sharp, Canadian dusk. It
was not easy bucking the swirling current of the Matagamasina.
The swift waters presented a mighty challenge to every Boy Scout

of Troop 5, Braddock, Pa.

Rising in his canoe, a veritable
Washington crossing the Delaware,
As st. Scoutmaster Teddy Geremsky
cried, "Forward, men!”

Then it happened.

A treacherous cross-current
rolled upon Master Teddy's vessel,
causing it to lurch and sending our
hero pitching over the stern into
the cold Canadian waters. Cer-
tainly this was a bit embarrassing
to the scout who had worked his

_way up through the rigors of Se-
icond Class,

First Class, and
Eagle Scout stages to eventually
become the idol of the troop.

No Less Esteemed

But in the eyes of his fellow
scouts, Wet Teddy was not a wit
less the man he was before this
never-to-be-mentioned day on
which they pulled him out of the
briny deep by his rear honor. For
Tall Teddy emerged undaunted,
calmly regained his composure,
and-‘from a sitting position-
directed his fleet to resume its
journey.

Three days and three nights.
One-hundred and fifty miles over
land and stream went Asst. Scout-
master Geremsky and his faithful
disciples. Like a Lewis and
Clarke rolled into one, this tanned
mammoth of sinew and flesh bat-
tled his way onward to the mouth
of the Matagamasima, where, in a
memorable ceremony, he planted
the flag of Troop 5, Braddock.

The stout helpers of Troop 5

/

roRwAR°; ”E”'

will someday tell their. grand-
children how they followed Tall
Teddy up the Matagamasina. This

6-4, 220-pound Greek God will
be remembered as more than just
another Pitt football player. Not
content to rest on gridiron laurels
alone, he went forth to conquer
other worlds.

American Spirit

To Braddock Campfire Girls,
he is "the man we would most like
to have toast our marshmallows.”
Braddock grandmothers wait at
street crossings, hoping for Boy
Scout Teddy to come by.

Truly, Tedd'y’s

record is one
that is warm with the American
spirit. Oh, how this typewriter

wishes we could be as proud of
some of the other lugs on the
Pitt team.

I tell you, when Teddy Geremsky
raises his right arm, joins his
thumb and fifth finger, and re-
cites, “On my honor I will do
my best...” it just does some-
thing to you deep down inside.

Duke Aided

(See Picture on‘ Page 7)

When Pitt’s Panthers think of
Duke, they automatically think of
Billy Cox. Almost all the news
they hear from the Durham, North
Carolina school is about the flashy
All-American tailback. It’s Billy
Cox this and Billy Cox that.

But the Panthers may be sur-
prised to find that the Blue Devils
have something more than Billy
Cox when they show up for their
September 30 opener in the South.

It’s true that Coach Wallace
Wade builds his attack around his
running and passing ace, but Wade
has several other standout per-
formers.

Three Pennsylvanians

And no less than three of his
key men hail from right here in
Pennsylvania-Blaine Eaton, Mike
Souchak, and Glenn Wild.

Eaton is a junior from Reading,
and is rated by many as the top
defensive end in the nation.Next
to Cox, Eaton is the most heralded
Blue Devil.

As the defensive left end in
Wade’s two-platoon system, Eaton

did not allow a first down around
his position during the final six
games of the 1949 season.
Another Souchak

Souchak should be a name fami-
liar to Pitt football fans, for
Frank, brother of Duke’s Mike,
was a Panther All-American end
under ]ock Sutherland. This year,
Mike Souchak, a senior from Ber-
wick, is set to hold down an offen-
sive end position for Duke.

Last season, Souchak was the
leading pass receiver for the Blue

1 .

by Local ‘Raidsi  

Devils, snagging I6 tosses for
209 yards and two touchdowns.
In addition to his pass catching
duties,‘ Mike did all the placekick-
ing for his team, booting 32 out of
38 extra point tries. a
Understudy to Cox

The third of the trio from Penn-
sylvania is Wild, the Pittsburgh
South Hills boy, who understudies
Cox. Wild, a junior, is a little fel-
low (5-8, 165 pounds), but can
throw on a par with Cox and is
rapidly improving as a runner.

  Glee Club
 Change Set

David G. Weiss, assistant pro-
fessof of music appreciation, has
maugrated a Freshmen Glee Club to

take the place of the Ellsworth
_Center Glee Club.
Weiss stated that he "would like

to think of the Freshmen group as a
supply unit for the University Glee
. Club as well as an opportunity for
freshmen men to participate in their

 

own group.”

The new club is scheduled to
meet Wednesdays from 6:30 to
8:30 p.m.

Preliminary tryouts for all choral
- groups are being held now in room
, " .3128 C1. and will continue through-
out the week.

The Pitt Singers are scheduled to
meet the fifth hour in room 324 C1.
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays,
while Men’s Glee Club will rehearse
Monday, Tuesday and Friday during
the ninth hour.

First rehearsals for the latter
groups are slated for Friday during
their respective hours.

 

Informal

Rush Starts

The first week of school opened
with a bang and fraternity rushing.

Informal rushing, started on Mon-
day will continue through Sunday,
Oct 7. During this'period the potent-
ial pledges are sounded out as to
their views on fraternities.

The formal rushing period opens
on Monday, October 8. This is the
time that the new students spend
visiting the various houses, attend-
ing dances and stag affairs. This
stage of rushing closes on Saturday,
October 21.

Formal rushing is followed by a
week of silence. During this week
fraternity matters are not discussed
between fraternity men and prospec-
tive candidates. Silence week, be-
ginning Sunday, Oct. 22, continues
through 4 p.m. Monday, Oct. 29.

Each fraternity submits a list of
the men to whom they wish to extend
bids to the Dean of Men during the
week of silence. The rushee then
receives the opportunity to declare
his choice of fraternity to a repre-
sentative of the dean of men.
