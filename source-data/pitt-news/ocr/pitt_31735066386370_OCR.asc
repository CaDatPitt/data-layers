University decides total divestment best policy

By Frances Sansig
News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
voted on July 1 to divest com-
pletely from South Africa. Pitt's
board oftrustees voted 16-0 in
favor of the movement, quelling
a 10-year dispute with local
groups that support divestment.

The resolution calls for the
complete disinvestment of stock-
holdings in American corpora-
tions that, by March 31, 1988,
have not effectively begun with-
drawl from South Africa and that
the divestment is to be complet-
ed by no later than Dec. 31,
1988.

"The move makes the University
of Pittsburgh another in a line of
universities that have chosen to
divest. It was only 15 months ago
when the former head of’ Pitt's
black studies department, Bar-

bara Sizemore, said, ”This board
of trustees has no intention to
make an effort to divest.”

Though the decision marks
what Pitt President Wesley
Posvar called a ”meaningful”
public statement, representatives
of Pitt's Black Action Society
expressed feelings of bitterness
about the decision, maintaining
that the university should have
never invested in South Africa.

The last year of demonstrations

‘prior to the university's decision

merely capped off the 10-year
battle between those for and
against divestment.

Last November, the BAS and
Pitt's Students for a Free South
Africa erected shanties on the
lawn of the William Pitt Union,
the center of student activities.

The daily and nightly manned
shanties were eventually vacated

with the onset of colder weather.

Deborah Gould, president of
SFSA, said the group had made
no decision as to whether they
would erect a shanty before the
meeting May 28 this year. The
group did not erect a shanty,
even though the board meeting
was abruptly adjourned because
of disruption by anti-apartheid

‘ demonstrators. Subsequently, the

meeting was rescheduled for July
1 .

Just one day before the May 28
meeting, the BAS staged anti-
apartheid demonstrations on the
WPU lawn in honor of those who
have died in South Africa

because of apartheid. Gail

Austin, a member of the Pitt
Divestment Coalition said, ”Not
only is it [keeping investments in
South Africa] morally wrong, but
it's economically wrong.”

Dennis Brutus, current chair-
man of the black studies depart-

ment, said, ”We are here to
remind people on this campus
[that] people are dying in South
Africa. As long as we are invested
in South Africa, we are involved
in the killings. This university will
not lose any money by getting
out of rascism.” '

At theluly 1 meeting, William
Gange, reading from the resolu-
tion on university investments in
companies doing business in
South Africa, said, ”The univer-
sity has adopted an increasingly
rigorous policy toward invest-
ment in stocks of American com-
panies operating in South Africa.

to wait until 1988 to divest.

Posvar responded by saying
that compared to other institu-
tions that have opted to divest,
”this is actually a very short
timetable.”

He said that Pitt's position has
been ”unswervingly anti-
apartheid.”

The university previously
adhered to a selective divestment
policy, which the board voted to

continue last Oct. 14. The policy 7

is-based on the Sullivan Princi-
ples, which, among other things,
prohibit racial discrimination in
the workplace and encourage
withdrawal of all funds from
banks that provide new loans to 5
South Africa. The Rev. Leon Su|- ’
livan, founder of the principles,
denounced them ealier this

spring. ‘

Campus police on alert to
criminal activity

alleviate

By Frances Sansig
News Editor

’’I don't know what's hap-
pening. Everybody’s coming
into‘ Oakland,” Walt Waters,
assistant director of public
safety at Pitt, said of the rela-

tively recent influx of city

youths who are lining the
streets of Oakland on
weekends.

For those of us who were
Pitt students last year, this
sounds hauntingly familiar.
Waters said that ”there hasn't
been much of an increase at
all”, in total crime in the area
compared to last year. ”We’re
having problems, though.”

Last September, headlines in
The Pitt News reflected the sit-
uation in Oakland — violent.
Violence had visibly hit hard,
in the form of hundreds of

' congregating youths.

The area in which the vio-
lence was occurring included
Forbes Avenue and Bouquet
Street and extended several
blocks down’ toward south
Oakland.

A meeting then between
Pittsburgh's chief of police,
William Moore, and Pitt's

director of public safety, Wil- _

liam Tucker, resulted inthe. in-
surance of city police that
extra officers would be
brought in.

Those "who witnessed the
”weekend war zone" said
youths were jumping on cars
and robbing people, among
other things.

”[l'hey]  would just rip
chains off of people, [then] just
walk away and laugh about
it,” said a Pitt sophomore, as
quoted in a September 1986
issue of The Pitt News.

”We were caught off guard,
and we apologize, but we
won't get caught off guard
again,” said Waters last Sep-
tember.

All quiet on the corner of Forbes and Bouquet this night.
The corner has been a problem area for campus and city

police on weekend nights.

Business leaders in the com-
munity met with city council
representatives to discuss what
measures could be taken.

”lt’s a zoo out there, a war
zone. l can see this blowing
up into a full-scale riot if things
continue the way they are. It's
going to be the kind of thing
we saw in the ’60s,” said a
representative of an Oakland
community organization in a
Pitt News article.

As a result of the meeting,
enforcement was stepped up.

Pitt's Office of Student Activi-
ties has one of the biggest, and
perhaps toughest, jobs of any

-department in the university sys-

tem — it has to try and meet the
extracurricular and co-curricular
needs of approximately 28,000
students.

Student Activities Director Joe
Cavalla said the office accom-
plishes this ”as best as possible.”

”We do what we can. We can't
meet everyone’s needs,” he said.

For Cavalla, the task that lies
ahead of him and the other 41
Pitt employees who work in the
Office of Student Activities may
be especially challenging at
present. This is a new position for
him — he is only in the middle
of his third month on the job.

’’I had a good idea what I was
getting myself into," said Cavalla,
who, prior to assuming the duties
of director of Student Activities at
Pitt, was director of the College
Center and Student Activities at
Rider College in Lawrenceville,
NJ. Rider College has a student
population of near 6,000.

He said what surprised him
most, though, about Pitt's student
activities office was ”the vast

. number of areas we're involved

in "

The office does encompass a

broad area, necessitated by the
variety of students who attend
Pitt. It administers to all student
organizations, including the
governance organizations like the
Black Action Society and the Stu-

Office of Student  
Activities aims to 
meet needs of all

dent Government Board. It also .

administers to the Pitt Program
Council, student media and the
Greek system.

In addition to all the student-
related organizations, the Office
of Student Activities is in charge

of managing the William Pitt‘
Union, the building in which stu— ;
dent organization offices are-

located.

An area in which Cavalla said
he feels the office has the biggest
impact is the financial area. it is
in charge, of administering the
Student Activities Fee. ”We work
with them [student organizations]

and try and keep them in line.” ’

Recently, Student Government A

Board President Phil Moyer was '
instrumental in having the Stu-.

dent Activities Fee increased.

Because Cavalla is relatively '

new, he said right now he can

only ”assume that Phil and the 
SGB felt their was a need to [in=’f‘ A

crease the] underwrite[ing of] the.

costs of those programs."

The board of trustees approved
the SGB’s proposal in May,
upping the fee for undergraduate

full-time students from $24 per»

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 31, l987

By Rae Ann Collette

Assistant News Editor

After living in the dorms,
many students opt for off-
campus housing in the Oak-
land area. The decision of

4 where to live proves to be a
difficult one. Most students
who live off-campus live in

» either north or south Oakland.
Which area is better?

After contacting at least 10
different, prominent realty
companies —- like Charles J.
Greve and Company, Click-
man Realty, Donral Properties’,
Daran Management Compa-
ny, Kamin Realty, A.R. Build-
ing Company and Marl-
borough Management — all
who lease apartments on an
annual contract in the Oak-
land area, it would be accurate
to say that the cost of living in
north and south Oakland is
relatively the same.

A furnished, two—bedroom
apartment in the south Oak-
land area — i.e., Oakland

Avenue, Atwood Street, Mey-

  Grass greener on

ran Avenue, McKee Place,
Dawson, Semple and Bates
streets — goes for about $485
per month, utilities included.
Depending on the area, size
and special features of the
apartment, the price varies.

According to the realty com-
panies contacted, most — but
not all — south Oakland apart-
ments have security front
doors. About 90 percent oflthe
realtors said they provide
equipped kitchens and wall-
to-wall carpeting in their units.
Few of the realtors provide a
24-hour maintenance service,
and few provide laundry
services. - ‘

Most places of residence in
south Oakland are only five— to
10-minute walk away from
campus and other essentials
such as: grocery stores, phar-
macies, medical services, gas
and repair stations, clothes
stores, the cleaners, laundry
mats, ice cream stores, beer
distributers, bars, an array of
fast—food places, libraries and
movie theaters.

the other side of Oakland?

According to the realty com-
panies that rent apartments in
south Oakland, most rentals
do not have private parking
lots. Therefore, students with
cars must obtain a permit to
park along the street.

A representative from Marl-

borough Management, a realty ‘

company that leases many
apartments in south Oakland,
said the company leases 85 to
90 percent of its units to col-
lege students, most of whom
are from Pitt.

’’I like living off-campus bet-
ter than living in the dorms
because I have more free-
doms, and I don't have to wor-
ry. about the noise level,”
fifth—year
major Scott Woodward said.
’’It seems like more students
live in south Oakland than in
north Oakland.”

A third-year dental student,
Randall Cutri, likes the con-
venience that south Oakland
offers. ’’I like the fact that my
place is so close to campus.”

Cutri does, however, have a

math/economics .

few-complaints about his Oak-
land Avenue apartment. ’’I dis-
like hearing all the noise from
the traffic and from the kids
who walk down the street after
the bars c|ose,” he said.
”There is no place to park, and
the nearby supermarket has
terrible meat and produce.”

Added Cutri, ’’I’d probably
live in north Oakland, but not
much is available there.”

Becky Miller, a third-year
education student, agrees.
”Now that I have lived in
south Oakland for a year, I'm
ready to move to north
Oakland.” ,

Miller said she appreciated
the conveniences south Oak-
land offered, but that she
wants a more secure building
and cannot find one in the
south Oakland area;

The average monthly rental

cost of a two-bedroom, fur- _

nished north Oakland apart-

- ment ranges from about $380
$600, utilities included.

The north Oakland area
includes N. Craig, Melwood

and N. Dithridge streets,
Center and N. Bellefield
avenues and others.

Most units, realtors said,
contain equipped kitchens,
private baths, wall-to-wall car-
peting, security systems, laun-
dry facilities and a
maintenance service.

North Oakland is about a 15
minute walk to campus. There
is, however, nearby campus
and public transportation.
Most apartments are within

walking distance of a grocery 

store, the cleaners, bars and
pharmacies. ‘

Most realtors said they pro— ‘
vide a parking area for their
occupants, usually" for a
monthly fee. ‘Resident parking
in north Oakland, 75 percent
-of the realtors contacted agree,
presents no problem.

A representative from_ the
A.R. ' Building Company, a
prominent realtor in north
Oakland, revealed that about
75 percent of the company's
occupants are Pitt students,

Italian  
groceria
spices up

 Oakland

By Toni Dzemyan
For The Pitt News

Just‘ last summer a banner was
displayed on Forbes Avenue that
read: ’’_Oak|and —— a world within

V a city.” And_that it is.

Take a walk down any of the
streets in Oakland, and you'll no-
tice something right away —— lots

and lots of ethnic shops and_

restaurants that serve the diverse,
highly ethnic community of
Oakland. -‘ 0

Maybe you don't realize just
how much you will gain -from
your education at Pitt. Besides
classroom learning, there's much
to discover. '

South Oakland is especially
known for its ethnicity. Restaur-
ants faring gourmet delights range
from East Asian to French cul-
tures, and you'll even find an
authentic Italian groceria, owned
and operated by the Merante
family. ‘

The business, in operation over
35 years, was founded by Italian
immigrant Pasquale Merante and
is now run by his three grand-
daughters, Filomena, Julia and
Gina. ”lt’s just beautiful; we have
a lot of fun,” said Gina.

The customers agree. One
regular was quick to tell me that
the Merante sisters will even
phone their regular customers if
they haven't been in the store,
just to see ifthey are feeling well
or need anything.

The store specializes in
imported goods from Italy.
There's always a smile and a
friendly hello awaiting you.

What has lured the various eth-
nic groups to Oakland? Many fa-
milies, like the Merantes, have
been settled here for years.
Others, because of the universi-
ty’s international appeal, have
come for study; ’ .7 '

Pitt hosts minority students

By Frances Sansig
News Editor

Pitt's Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid sponsored a special
recruitment program this August
for black students who are com-
templating college as a post-high
school option. The effort is the
first of its kind for the university,
according to senior counselor
Paula Davis. '

”Each One
Teach One,” designed to be part
of Pitt's active recruitment for
black students, allowed students
and their parents to stay overnight
and participate in the various
activities of the program at no
cost.

”We have special, as well as
ongoing, efforts for the recruit-
ment of minority students,” said
Davis. Each year, Pitt visits high
schools as part of regular recruit-

 Reach One  ‘

ment. But Davis said there is a
special need to recruit black
students.

”When you think about the fact
that Pitt is an urban institution,
we have to have a minority com-
mitment,” said Davis.

Davis said that the event was
an attempt to introduce students
to a campus atmosphere. Stu-
dents received information about
educational opportunities, finan-
cial planning, student life and
supportive services, and were
given advice on how to begin

' selecting the college that is right

for them. T

Bill Nunn, associate director of
admissions, said that the turnout
was encouraging and that the stu-
dents who participated were
mpressive.

”The staff worked very closely
with them. Dr. Dennis Brutus
spoke to them at a luncheon.

Everyone came away very
mpressed,” said Nunn.

According to Davis, the
response from the university
community was overwhelming.
Pitt students also volunteered to
help with the event.

”This is an all—out effort by the
university to recruit black stu-
dents and to involve a variety of
people — ministers, parents,
alumni — in reaching out and
ntroducing students to the college
experience,” said Davis.

The office has also planned
another first-of—its-kind event,
which Davis said they are hoping
to hold sometime in December
— a Pittsburgh Public School
Day. The university would serve
as an open house to students in
the school district who are think-
ing about attending college.

may change their major at
least once during their college
years, according to a Pennsyl-
vania State University study.

”From 1982to 1985,81 to
84 percent of freshmen par-
ticipating in an educational
planning survey have said they
may switch majors at least
once,” said James J. Kelly, as-
sistant director for the division
of undergraduate studies.

”We have learned that
engineers are just as uncertain
as liberal arts students,” he
said. "Many students may
make their choices in their last
year of high school or even. in
‘the beginning of their fresh-
man year.” A

An average of 60 percent of
the 40,000 freshmen surveyed

knew only a moderate amount

about their choice of majors;
from 21 to 25 percent knew
little or nothing about their _
selections. .»

Art McDonald, an advisor at
the CAS advising center, said
most freshman do not decide
what to major in and that their
first year is used as an ex-_
perience — taking a variety of
courses — and then choosing
what they liked the most.

Kip Ruefle, a senior now
majoring in secondary educa-
tion, is an example of what it's
like to ”feel your way” to the
major that suits you best.

Cathedral of Learning tops
when it comes to education

By Ed Tureen
Staff Writer

Chancellor Bo wman’s
ambitions rewarded

The 19205 was a time of great
expansion for the University of
Pittsburgh. The university
embarked on a program of build-
ing, the likes of which haven't
been seen since.

Out of this time and out of the
mind of Pitt Chancellor John
Gabbert Bowman rose the
Cathedral of Learning.

It can be said that the Cathedral
exists because of the hard work
of one man, who tirelessly fought
the university establishment and
the community to see his dream
completed.

It was Bowman's idea to use
truncated gothic architecture to
express his contention that edu-
cation is a never—ending process.
In truncated gothic, parallel lines
never meet, thereby helping to
illustrate Bowman's point.

It was Bowman who worked to
raise the funds necessary to con-
struct the building.

According to Maxine Bruhns,
director of the Cathedral's
Nationality Rooms, ”The
Cathedral of Learning was an
idea before its time; namely mak-
ing a skyscraper schoolhouse and
having it funded by the com-
munity.”

The Cathedral-of Learning rises -

above Pitt's campus 42 stories to
a height of 535 feet.‘ It is the

second largest building in the -

world that is devoted to edu-
cation.

Rooms to represent
nationalities favored

On Sept. 23, 1926, ground was
broken for the Cathedral. Con-
struction proceeded slowly until
the first class took place in the
still-uncompleted building on
Feb. 28, 1931.

1

According to Bruhns, ”For all
practical purposes the Cathedral
was finally finished in 1938.”

Inside the Cathedral are 19
Nationality Rooms that stand as
monuments to the different
nationalities that make up the
Pittsburgh community.

Originally, Bowman wanted to
create rooms that represented
different disiplines such as
philosophy and literature. But the
idea was soon scrapped when he
realized how much of a boon
nationality rooms would be both
to the university and the com-
munity. .

Each nationality contributed
the funds to help construct its
respective classroom. There is an
exception, though — the English
Classroom was constructed using
money from the Mellon family,
along with community funds.

Not all of the Nationality
Rooms are on the first floor, as
many people think. The Early

. American Classroom, for one, is
located on the third floor of the *

building.
There are five new Nationality

Rooms, which will also be
located on the third floor. The‘
Israeli Classroom is on the verge

of completion and will be open
sometime in August. The Arme-
nian Classroom will be complet-
ed in January or Febuary of 1988.
The African, Ukranian and Aus-
trian rooms are also underway.

These rooms, as are all of the
other Nationality Rooms, will be
funded by the nationalities them-
selves.

More than just a tall
building to study in

A There are many interesting sto-
ries related to the Cathedral . One
of them concerns a seismograph
that has now found a permanent
home in the Cathedral storage
room. The seismograph was
‘originally intended to record the
earth's activity in the Oakland
area. ’ '

The problem was that all the
device picked up was the rumble
made by passing trolley cars.
Hence, the seismograph found its
home in a storage room as an
interesting bit of history rather

‘ than in a lab as a tool for scientific

research.
There are many things people
not know about the Cathedral,

such as the story above. But it ’

seems that everyone has an opin-
ion on the structure itself.

According to Dave Leppo, an
incoming freshman, ’’It seems so
majestic.”

Another student, Mike Dough-
erty, a junior said, '’It symbolizes
Pitt. I like it — it is Pitt. People
from out of town are amazed by
it, and I -think the Nationality
Roomsare a nice touch/’_,

Mini is serious skirt

By Stephanie Gruich

For The Pitt News

In 1947, the fashion world
offered women the opportun-
ity to be daring by introducing
the bikini. But compared to
today's bathing suits —
whether they are one or two
pieces — the first bikinis look
like scuba suits.

And then there was the
hemming-up of the skirt 20
years ago, which marked the

birth of the mini.

In the past few years, it has
been making a comeback, and
this fall and winter the stores
will be displaying miniskirts
that are shorter than ever —
mid-thigh, and all lengths and
styles.

Nijole, fashion publicity
director for Pittsburgh's Saks
Fifth Avenue, said, ”The short
skirt is just a newer addition,
and all lengths of skirts are still

Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK — The miniskirt is making a come-
back after being shelved for nearly 20 years, and
there are numerous theories on why hemlines are
inching up. ,

Calvin Klein thinks longer lengths became old and
tired. Akira said women are being rewarded after
years of exercise and dieting. A design teacher thinks
it all may have started as a joke.

’’It came out of the big '60s revival that fashion
is going through,” said Bill Ranticelli, a freelance
designer and faculty member at Parson's School of
Design. ’’It started as a bit of a goof, but it looked
quite refreshing on the runway and very young.
Nothing ’youthfulizes’ more than a short skirt does.”

American designers went big with the mini in their
fall/winter collections. They offered playful casual-
wear, sophisticated suits and sleek, glittery evening
clothes — with hemlines mid-thigh or above.

’’It just seemed to me that anything long got very
old-looking and tired,” said Klein, who paired short,
short stretch miniskirts with opaque stockings or
over—the—knee suede boots.

’’I think this was something that was gradually
happening. I don't think‘ we're going to go back to

.mid-calf skirts for a long time,” he said.

Klein said he doesn't think the minis of the 19805
were a throwback to those of the '60s because the
proportions were updated and ”completely
different.” ’ P

His stretch miniskirts and short wrap-around dress-
es coincided with body-hugging fashions by other
designers made with soft, sensual fabrics like cash-
mere and wool jersey.

As designer ’ Akira said, today's women have
”pummeIed, jogged and Fonda-ized” themselves
into shape and thus, ”as the most beautiful and ath- I
letically fit women on the planet, they deserve a
‘new look’ to show off their lithe, shapely bodies.”

Diane Von Furstenburg also notes a raised body-
consciousness.

’’It was time to re-evaluate the body, re-emphasize
the legs," she said. ‘fl think today's mid-thigh minis
will evolve to a comfortable above-the-knee length
for form-fitting skirts and dresses, and below the

" knee for loose or full skirts."

Patricia Pastor,.who designs for the Perry Ellis col-
lection, is amazedat the recent hoopla surround-
ing short skirts because she said they've been around
for some time. _ - «

 '

R. Scott Cornohon/The Pitt News

Alice Munshower, a Pitt graduate student,
models her own denim miniskirt.

”This fall, there was a tremendous amount of it,
but theywere there last spring and last fall," she said.
"I was looking at old videotapes of Perry Ellis col-
lections and,‘ in every single show, we have had
short skirts."

Pastor did say that the shorter skirts, which stop

substantially above the knee, are a recent de-

velopment.

”That I think is a very modern look, and it's new,"
she said. ”|t’s very exciting to all of a sudden be able
to show some leg.” _

Johntown campus ”shapin

By Doug Raynor
For The Pitt News

With unemployment at an all
time low in the bituminous coal
mining town of Johnstown, it
would seem difficult — if not
impossible — to reach a close to
$9 million fund drive campaign
goal for a small university cam-
pus in the area.

However, for the people at the
University of Pittsburgh, Johns-
town campus, that doesn't seem
to be the case. According to Bill
Dillon, assistant director of
Development and Public Affairs

 

   
  

   
    



at UP], the ”Shaping a’ Future:
Campaign for UPJ” is already a
big success.

”Because of two major dona-
tions, our capital campaign goal
of $8.7 million is over half
reached,” said Dillon.

‘One major gift received was a
$1 million Olympic—size swim-
ming pool that will be added on
to the sports center.'This pool,
which will be called the Zamias
Aquatic Center, was donated by
George D. and Marianna Zamias
of Johnstown. I
- ”The poolwill be for general
use,” said Dillon. ”A swim team



       

led  

I

is not in the plans as of yet, but
intramurals -and other activities
will take place there.”

Construction for the Zamias
Aquatic Center will begin in early
September, and the pool should
be ready for use by early spring.

Another donation was present-_

ed to UP] by Frank J. and Sylvia
Pasquerilla, also of Johnstown.
From them will come the $4 mil-
lion Pasquerilla Performing Arts
Center. Dillon said the arts center
will hold concerts, theater
presentations, special film series
and art exhibits.

Dillon also said that most of
these events now take "place in
UPJ’s student union, in an area
much like a lecture hall, so the
center will be an inviting change.

”C.round—breaking, for the
Pasquerilla Arts Center will occur
in the spring of 1988,” said Dil-
lon. It should be completed in the
fall of l989.

The leadership committee of
the campaign is contacting com-
munity residents and businesses
to raise the $8.7 million. Dillon
said the committee also plans on

soliciting campus alumni along ~

with faculty and staff members.

”There is a definite positive
reaction,” said Dillon, from the

approximate 2,600 studentsat‘ w

- UPJ in regards to the ”Shaping a :'_

Future” campaign. “They have
recognized a need for it [im—s_
provements in the school's facil-' K‘

ities], and there really has been

an obvious need. And now,

we're doing it.” y
As UPJ celebrates its 60th

anniversary, Dillon said, ”We’re, T

the fall.” .

For The Pitt News

 Students and faculty‘ at the

Titusville campus have a lot to

 look forward to this year. First,
-‘there are many more individuals
 enrolled than the 226 students

from the '86-87 school year.
- ”There are now 210 full—time
and 1 10 part-time students,” said

i Howard Newson, the school's

L .- new actingexecutive dean. ”Last

year, we had 58 freshmen, but

v this year we're welcoming 170 of

them,” said Newson, of the
second largest freshman class in
the" school's history.

Newson predicts that in about

. two years, the statistics will rise

to about 400 full-time, 150 part-
’ time students and 50 to 60 com-
vimuters.

The rise in enrollment has
called for changes in the curricu-
lum. Fifteen new computers will
be incorporated into the science,

-v math and English departments’

programs.
According to Eugene Gettig,
coordinator of the computer
center, the math and science
departments will use ”modeling

simulation” to conveyVdifficult'

concepts such as differential
equations and population
dynamics (how populations
change in size) to students.
Graphs and diagrams in the
text or on the chalkboard often
do not show the transition from
one stage to another. Modeling
simulation will graphically show
the students how graphs and
diagrams move from one stage to
another "hopefully clarifying

difficult concepts,” said Gettig.

The English department will
use the new computers to help
students write and utilize better
grammar by having them com-
pose their assignments on word
processors.

Students are not the only ones ‘

involved with the new com-
puters. Gettig said, ’’[I’d] like the

[I'd] rather have them tailor soft-
ware to fit their courses than
tailor their courses to available
software.”

And to assist faculty with this
project, the campus has opened
a new position in the computer
department, ”technical support
person.” This position, filled by
Gregory King, a Pitt Bachelor of
Science graduate in computer
science, entails working with
Titusville faculty as they develop
their software, keeping commu-
nication open with computer
science faculty on the main
campus.

In’ "addition to the 15 new
Macintosh computers, the cam-
pus is expecting six Apple 2-G's.

The computer department is
also being renovated. The plans
include the installation of air con-

ditioning, carpeting and study‘ ,

stalls in the computer room.
Gettig said, ”Often, computer
rooms are crowded, quite busy
and don't have much room to
work in  we're making ours
comfortable and friendly.”

But the computer center isn't
the only one benefittingfrom
remodeling. The $500,000 grant
received by the Titusville campus
in August 1986 will also help pay
for remodeling of the student
facilities, including, for example,
the installation of new furniture
in student dormitories and town-
houses. ' V

Part of this grant is also being
channelled into the implementa-
tion of new academic programs
geared toward ”special help” stu-

‘dents. The program enables
faculty to test students for their-

weaknesses, whether academic
or not. Then‘ faculty can consult
with their colleagues on the main
campus and determine which
materials will best help the tested
students.

itusville expands as enrollment increases

Special help students, said
Newson, are those students who,
despite their average to high lQs,
may suffer from poor study habits
or low self—confidence, which
results in lower college academic
performances.

Newson said this kind of per-
sonal attention is what draws stu-
dents to Titusville. ’’Our job is
giving personal attendance,” he
added. ‘

And personal attention is evi-
dent in the way new students are
oriented to the campus. Judy Ber-

~'neburg, acting dean of students,

said the campus’ 19 mentors

‘ began preparing to help freshmen

acquaint themselves ‘with the
campus in early January.
Throughout the summer, the
campus conducts three registra-
tion: sessions, compatible with the
main campus’ advising sessions,
in which freshmen tour the cam-
pus, meet their administrators

and faculty and register for»

classes.

I THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 31, 1987

By Rae Ann Collette

Assistant News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
at Bradford is attempting to
respond to the needs of sexu-
ally active college students.
While it, like most other
universities, distributes litera-
ture advising the practice of
safe sex, it has discussed the
possibility of installing con-
dom vending machines on
campus.

”Larger universities usually
make condoms available in
the health center,” according
to Dr. K. James Evans, dean of
Student Affairs at Bradford.
However, he said that there is
nowhere on Bradford's small
campus to purchase condoms
and that the nearest drugstore

away.

”Although the final decision
has not been made yet, UPB
is leaning toward placing one

is almost one and a half miles‘ —

machine in the Self-Care
Center on campus before the
fall term begins,” said Evans.
”Our university feels that we
must educate and supply pro-
tection to our students who
choose to be sexually active.”

Evans said that UPB Presi-
dent Dr. Richard McDowell is
reviewing the issue and plans
to make the final decision as
to whether or not the campus
will install a condom vending
machine. '

’’I’m in favor of the installa-
tion of condom vending
machines for health reasons —-
it’s really not a moral issue,”
Evans said.

At the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Oakland campus, As-

sistant Vice President for

Student Affairs Dennis Don-
ham had said there was a pos-
sibility that the vending
machines would be installed
here.

Condoms an issue at UPB

”We’re looking at several
options where students can
purchase condoms,” Donham
said. "Vending machines are
one alternative.”

Dr. Conney Kimbo, dean of
Student Affairs at the Oakland
campus, said the unversity has
decided, however, after
reviewing the matter, not to in-
stall condom vending
machines at this time.

"Since the student health
pharmacy carries condoms, as
well as other pharmacies in
the area, we feel there really
is no need to install a condom
vending machine,” Kimbo
said. ”Condoms are readily
available and have been on

.our campus.’-’

No decision as to whether
UPB will install condom vend-
ing machines was available at
press time.

”Five—year plan” to
expand Creensburg
currently underway

By Paula Dziedzic

Editor in Chief
The UPC Press

With only 1,500 or so students
— 90 percent of whom are com-
muters — the University of Pitts-
burgh at Creensburg has been
called everything from ”a major
university in a small college set-
ting" to ”13th grade with

» ashtrays.”

For years, students at UPC
have had no recreational outlet
other than a combination basket-
ball/tennis court and a one-room
ping pong/video game center.

Student organizations such as
language clubs, Student Govern-
ment Association and the Busi-
ness Honor Society have met in

empty classrooms — and faculty '

members have advised these

same students from bathrooms
and closets that were renovated
to provide office accommo-
dations. '

Over the past few years,
administrators at the Creensburg
campus have devised a plan to
solve these inconveniences and
enhance student life overall. The
"five-year plan,” as it is known,
is already underway with the
completion of a new faculty
office building and the installa-
tion of a sophisticated phone sys-
tem that links UPC directly to the
Oakland campus. , .

But perhaps the _most exciting
aspect of UPC’s expansion is the
promise of a student center.

Dr. Cuy Rossetti, "dean of
administration, said the center
should be completed within two
years. This new building will be
entirely for student use and may
contain a gymnasium, activity
wing (including offices for stu-
dent organizations) and a dining

Exactly what features the center
will have depends on funding
and need. However, the dining
hall is almost a certainty since the
current dining area will be con-
verted to a new computer center
linking -UPC with Oakland via
fiberoptics. .

Along with the physical
changes at UPC, academic
changes are also part of the plan.

Dr. Norman W. Scanlon,
associate dean of instruction, is
heading the drive to make UPC
a degree-granting branch of Pitt.

Degree-granting status would
enable UPC to create new
majors, set course requirements
and grant degrees without having»
to consult Oakland at every turn.

It would also allow more stu-
dents to complete their degrees
at Creensburg instead of relocat-
ing to a degree-granting campus

such as Oakland or lohnstown.‘

As it stands now, Creensburgl
will expand the writing and
anthropology programs for the
fall of 1987, according to Scan-
lon, and a certificate program in
geratology is also being con-
sidered. -_

It is hoped that all of these
buildings will be completed by
1992. .

_All of this is a major accoml
plishment for the regional cam-l
pus. UPC was threatened witll
the possibility of becoming a tvv

year institution only two year,
ago when a report from Provost
Roger Benjamin stated, ”... Thel
possibility of integrating UPCl
with CCS [College of Cenera
Studies] will be kept in mind.”

 

Had this gone into effect, is
would have meant not.only thql
elimination of its four-year degree
programs, but would also eradi-l
cate faculty tenure. UPC reject '
the ideaand formed a committej
to work to maintain the school’
four-year status. "’M" 

 

The first‘ four-year program,
management, was introduced to’

_-_'the curriculum in 1971. Since

then, many other bachelor's
degree programs have bee‘
added, including administration
of justice, English -writing anti

Creativity key tosuccessful college experience

exactly comparable with The
Vista, the food in the cafeteria
looks worse than expected, and
you're absolutely horrified that
no one is wearing flourescent

just in style? _

Never fear. Here's what I'd like
to call the Things—Freshmen—
Need— To — Know— But — Don't-
’Til — They're — Sophomores
Guide.

For instance, your room. How
does one turn a shoe box into

pleasant, even livable quarters?
All you need is a little imagina-
tion (although anything is bound
to make Towers room look bet-
ter), hard work and shopping at
the right places to enhance your
room's personal decor.

A trip no freshman can afford
to miss (literally) is a trip to Forbes
Variety Store, 212 Atwood St.
Treasures abound for the dorm-
room decorator in this discount
dynamo. Here you'll find every-
thing from school supplies
(which you'll need ifyou plan to

go to class) to floor rugs and wall‘

hangings, all at lower-than-
average prices.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 3l, 1987

By Eric Poole
Staff Writer

Mike Carotta’s job involves tasting beer.

Before you ask where to sign up, be
advised that tasting beer is only a small
part of the job.

Carotta is the brewmaster at Pittsburgh
Brewing Company, and as such, he is in
charge of the brewing of all Pittsburgh
Brewing. Company products. This
includes Iron City Beer, |.C. Light, l.C.
Cooler, LC. Golden Lager, Old Dutch,
Old German and the new Britt Iced Tea
Breeze.

Although it is not officially a PBC
product, Samuel Adams Boston Lager is
brewed here in Pittsburgh.

Samuel Adams has brought PBC a good

deal of notoriety stemming from the

beer’s first—place finish at the Denver Beer
festival for small breweries in 1986.

Periodically, cases of Samuel Adams
are shipped to the White House, where
it is presumably consumed at presiden-
tial barbeques.

’’I don't even think that President Rea-
gandrinks beer,” said Carotta. ”But peo-
ple there [at the White House] have told
me that they like it.”

The most recent addition to the PBC
line-up is the highly publicized American
Beer, which has been rumored to be

either Old German or l.C. Golden Lager
under a new label.

”Who said that? I'll kill them!” snarled
Carotta in mock anger. Then, calmer, he
added, ”No, American Beer is a new
formula.” ,

The basic process behind beer-making
is divided into two segments: the hot
brewing and the cold process.

In the first step, water and corn are
placed in a cooker and heated to loosen
up the complex carbohydrates in the
corn. ”At a certain temperature, the mix-
ture reaches a state of gelatinization.

CITY

BEAT  

”The mixture is then brought to a boil-
ing temperature to give it a corn flavor.
It's good for the beer,” said Carotta.

Whether or not com is ”good for the

6 beer” is a question as old as the craft of

beer-making itself.

Until last March, when the European 6

Court struck down the Reinheisgebot
(beer purity law), the only American beer
that could legally be sold in West Ger-
many was Samuel Adams because it is
brewed without corn, in effect bypassing
this first step.

Stacked kegs of beer at the Pittburgh Brewing Company.

”The Reinheisgebot states that you have
to brew with malt, water, yeast and
hops,” explained Carotta. You weren't
allowed to use corn.

’’In American beers, corn gives you a
product that will last longer. A lot of
natural ingredients in the malt will cause
things in the beer such as hazes, off tastes
and oxidation. A
_ ’’If you use all malt, youwill get fuller
body, a grainy taste, but it will turn cloudy
on you in a shorter period of time,” said
Carotta. '

The Reinheisgebot prohibited the sale
in Germany, and later West Germany, of
beer that contained any source of preserv-
ing starch or adjunct. The law was struck
down on the grounds that it was an unfair
prohibition on trade with other European
nations.

At this point of the process, the corn-

_ water mix is drained out of the cooker and

into the mash ton. While the corn-water
mix is boiled in step one, a water-barley

malt mix is being heated in the mash ton.

”When we have the corn boiling in the
cooker and when we have the enzymes
drawn out of the malt, we drop the hot
starch into the‘ mash ton,” Carotta
described the process in the terms of a
chemist, which he is.

The starches separate into fermentable » P

and non-fermentable sugars.

This mix, now largely a sugar solution,
is drained through a lauter tub into cop-
per kettles, and the waste grain (called
wort) suspended in the solution is sold as
animal feed.

In the copper kettles, the solution is
brought steam—heated to a boil to com-
plete the hot-brewing process.

Carotta, who holds a degree in chemis-
try from St. Vincent College and a degree
in brewing technology from Seeples
Institute of Brewing Technology in Chica-
go, said the actual brewing is only a small
part of the process of beer-making.

— try and government that will carry

  

By Christopher Sepesy

Contributing Editor

1987 marks not only the University of Pit-tsburgh’s bicen-
tennial, but also the 20th-year of the presidency of Wesley
Posvar. A

Much has been accomplished by Posvar and his adminis-
trations — funding and appropriations from the state that
were not available previously, improved classrooms, labora-
tories and athletic facilities and a major co-investment with
Carnegie Mellon University and the US. Department of
Defense.

Recently, Posvar was an instrumental force in negotiating
a $100 million gift to Pitt from Culf/Chevron Corporation.
Also because of Posvar, Pitt broke the ground for a new $28

- million biotechnology center that will develop vaccines,

medicines and biomedical products. t
Posvar was honored in 7986 as being a co—recipient of
Pittsburgh Magazine's first ”Pittsburgher of the Year” award.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 3T, l_987

Q: When you talk about the political crises during the late

"60s and early '70s, some say that at Pittthe problems really

weren't that bad. Any truth to this?

A: The pressures here were as severe as they were any-
where. I just like to think we were more successful in relat-
ing to the concerns of both the public and the students.

At the time, we made reforms in governance that were
progressive and preceeded demands made by students else-
where for reform. We had made them already. We estab-
lished very strong communication linkages with leaders of
some of the more passionate interest groups, such as minori-
ties and later women who were striving for greater
opportunities.

As a consequence, we didn't have the violence that trans-
pired on some campuses.  But I think we had to work very
hard to make that situation possible.

Q: How would you consider yourself politically? Liberal,
conservative or moderate. - z

A: Well, I think I'm a liberal, no, lam a strong liberal in

' social issues and, in_fiscal matters, I

He received this honor along with Dr.
Richard Cyert, president of Carnegie
Mellon University. The two were I I
recognized for ”their vision and leader-
ship and for forging bonds with indus-
Pittsburgh into the 21st century."

Posvar recently completed a Europe-
an tour that he hopes will be benefi-
cial to the newly proposed ”Campaign
for the Third Century.” Upon complet-
ing this trip, he spoke with The,Pitt
News about his memories of the past,
realities of the present and visions for
the future.

Q: Is the Wesley Posvar who came
here during the '60s the same Wesley
Posvar in the 19805?

A: Well, I think the answer has to be

think I'm a liberal,
no, I am .a strong

fiscal matters, I.

pressive past. First in your class from
West Point, listed as being one of the
10 Outstanding Young [Men in the
United States by the U.S. Junior Cham-
ber of Commerce in 1959, etc. How
did such a past help prepare you or did
it prepare you for the presidency_ of the
University of Pittsburgh?
‘_ A: Do you mean being in th;
military?  
Q: No, ‘just the type of past you have
had overall? ~ = '
A: Well ,I .think that my experience
as a military officer was very helpful in
terms of management skills and style,

yes and no. I'm very much the same

person enriched by the experience of the intervening years.
I've learned a great deal through mistakes and initiatives
made at the time, and I think I'm more prepared to deal with
university issues today — certainly more prepared than I was

‘ 20 years ago.

But one of the exciting things about this position is that
it presents an ever—changing set of challenges. It's a different
university and a different world. i
‘ Q: How so? ‘

A: Well,‘ it's a qualitatively larger and greatly strengthened
university. Its pofessional programs have embarked upon Sig,-
nificant change in certain areas such as information science,

, medicine, engineering, biotechnology, law, public adminis-

tration and others. We are moving ahead with a strong

. qualitative improvement in undergraduate liberal arts with

the honors program and honors college, and with the ad-
ventof our new provost whose specialty is this area.

’ We are a major actor in the international scene — this is
a major world university, one of the strongest of such.

' The world is quite different. We now have a global socie-
ty with global telecommunications, instant direct-dialing,
satellite television, world public opinion and there is a true
world network of scholarship that is very very important. The

A trip I just completed exemplified that once again.

Q: When you came here during the late 1960s, it is as-
sumed that you had a set of goals pre-planned that you want-
ed fulfilled during your years here.

A: That is correct.

Q: Have they been fulfilled?

A: Well again, goals are never really fulfilled, and the goals
in my.case evolve to become more ambitious as time goes

~ by. I think this is a better university than I could have visual-

ized for it 20 years ago,

The course of progress, however, was not steady or unin-
terrupted. I first had to deal with the funding crisis that was
very much present when I was here, pay off a significant debt,
which we did over a series of years. Then we were faced
with the period of great political turmoil here i_n the United
States, and around the world actually. This affected the cam-
puses a great deal and consumed our attention for a num-
ber of years. "

We also went through some tough times in relation to state

. funding.

But I think all those issues are stablized, and we're finally

. back on a solidvfooting.

nication and soliciting participation.

I think that my education at Oxford and at Harvard where j
I was a graduate student and a research associate at MIT were 
of crucial importance in preparing me for this job. They gave" . .

me the credential that enabled me to lead a faculty but also

made me very sensitive -to the political values that are inher- 

ent in university life. — »

Throughout my career, even the early military phase, ‘was
at two academies '—' West Point and the United States'Air ‘

Force Academy’— and with Oxford and Harvard combined, .'
and now. Pitt, .l"'ve spent really 90.percent.of_ mycareer in

higher education.
Q: You were atest pilot? ‘ . .1
A: Yes. I i

Q: During what-years did you do this? '  I I K I‘

A: That was in 1947 and 1948. .

Q:-Do you know Chuck Yeager? ' a 1 ' ,

A: Yes, I know him quite well.

Q: Was it like it was portrayed as in The Right Stuff?

A: Yes. I was the youngest pilot in a flight test squadron
at Eglund Field in Florida. I was newly graduated, and I was
then 21 years old. I

My colleagues were old. I was a second lieutenant, and
my colleagues were old captains and majors of ages 25 and
26.» They were combat veterans as well.

It was an extraordinary experience because they had all
of the airplanes of all types there, from the war as well as
the new at the time models, and I had an opportunity to fly
all of them. -

Q: Is that something you'll probably _want to tell your
grandchildren about? '

A: Oh, yes! The stories will get better and better!

Q: Do you consider the role you played in the Air Force
one of your most significant achievements? Was that some-
thing you were really working for?

A: No. That was very, very much an ‘early stage and, for
me, the aviation stage was equivalent to several years of‘war-
‘time service that other people gave during World War II. I
was too young for that.

But it really didn't relate directly to anything I have done
since in my academic career.

Q: Concerning athletics, during your years here you've
been able to see a national champion football team in 1976
and, just this past year, a basketball team that only seems

   
  
 

.o.\,»\., o.
. s
,4 —...-x -N.

» Q: You've certainly got quite theim- 

about delegating authority and commu- ._ V

 

A: Yes, I think it's fair to say that I am a strong sports fan.

I helped make a decision in the first few years I was here
at this university that this university had to have athletic pro-
grams that were of quality and prestige, that would match
the status of the whole institution. We had to have both high
academic standards as well as high standards of success in
athletics in order to compete.

To continue in a situation of not matching our competi-
tion on the athletic fields of battle was simply not acceptgltle.

Q: You said last October, when you served on the N“*'f\A
Presidents’ Council, that you've done a lot and made man
strides for the ”student-athlete." How so? '

A: Well, I would put it mainly as an obligation to the
student-athlete. . I

I feel we owe the student-athlete, and I say this to them
and to their parents when I meet them. We here at Pitt_give
an excellent opportunity to progress toward graduationand

_to graduate. And we're very proud of the graduation rate we

have here of the student-athlete —- which I wouldguess is

think I'm rather conservative in terms  I

pushing about 90 percent.or, at least, well over 80 percent.

Among collegiate athletes, this is one of the highest rates’
in the country. -

I think this is an obligation to the athlete, and I think it

is deplorable that at many institutions this is not a,major.con- '

cern of the athletic administration. In turn, the students are
exploited, they're used. That's wrong.’
And also, it's entirely consistent to be a successful student
and an outstanding athlete. " 1 .
Q: Here at Pitt, therehave certainly been some problems

in the past with some athletes. To cite a quick example wc1§.ld. ’

be what happened just two months ago-with "Charles Glad-
man "and Teryl Austin and‘ the agents. As a member of the
Presidents’ Council of the NCAA, is there anything you

These agents who come in, and deceive and take advan-
tage of inexperienced young people. I think they're beneath
contempt.

All I know is we'll do everything in our power to keep them
away from here and to counter their malicious influence.

Those students who were involved were victims. Very
much victims of deceit.

Q: You spoke a little about minorities and how, since you
have been here, certain programs of yours have favored them
and helped them very much. Is there a new program begin-
ning this year for a new minority push for incoming
freshmen? .

A: Yes.

Q: What is it?

A: Well, let me say that in our first phase, we started from
virtually zero minority representation as a primarily white
institution and built up undergraduate enrollments to a per-
centage where undergraduate liberal arts is in the same ball
park as the proportion that they are of the population.

However, those percentages are lower in the specialized
fields and in the professional fields, but we have been mak-
ing progress in specifically targetted areas such as medicine
and law, and we hope to make more progress in those areas
very soon." A

As a world—class institution, it is more our duty to do so
rather than as a selected venture.

But the faculty situation remains very disturbing, and we
have to put all our resources in to make a renewed effort
to recruit more minority faculty.

The undergraduate recruitment is setting a new priority for
recruiting the best qualified black students we can find. These
are the ones who are not educationally disadvantaged but
rather the ones who have high potential. And we think to
give special attention to them is important because we want
to in turn set them on a course leading to the more highly
demanding professions.

Not only medicine and law, but physics and chemistry as
well.

‘on my recent trip.

Q: The two biggest uproars here since 1983 were when
Louis Farrakhan came here to speak and, of course, the apart-
heid situation. The university has recently divested all its
funds from the Republic of South Africa. You maintained all
along that you wanted divestment but didn't yet have the
support throughout other channels. What was the stumbling
block? "

A: There really wasn't a stumbling block because our poli-
cy was consistent all along. It was the situation itself, which
kept changing.

We had pursued from the outset support of the Sullivan
Principles. That is encouraging companies who had signed
an agreement that they would take measures opposing apart-
heid in South Africa that we would still want their stock and
dispose of stock in companies, which did not subscribe to
these anti—apartheid measures.

Over the period of four or five years when the Sullivan
Principles were in effect, the standards kept getting more and
more strict and exclusive, and we reduced our ownership
in American companies in South Africa as a consequence.

And then after he [Sullivan] had set a deadline of last May
for some significant step by the-South African government
against apartheid, the deadline wasn't met, and he withdrew
his support for any American participation. We followed his
cue and then made the decision to divest.

So we were consistently along with him throughout this
period of time.

Q: Was that the main reason for divesting? —

A: It had now reached the point that it was not really feasi-
ble anymore to think of large numbers of American corpo-
rations working in concert In South Africa effectively against
apartheid. Their position had eroded so much that the sym-
bolic value and the solidarity of opposition to apartheid
through this symbolic act became of paramount importance.

Therefore, we both have made the divestment decision,
and we still support what were the Sullivan Principles. We
applaud the past actions and present actions of any compa-
ny in South Africa — American-owned, English—owned or
South African-owned — that is pursuing measures for equal
employment opportunity, for equal promotion, for equal pay.

Those principles remain extremely important.

And the last thing we want is to leave the impression that
we no longer care and that we have turned our back on the
problem of South Africa.

Q: Do you prescribe any furthur course of action?

from generation to generation. What have you seen as t,
major change —— and the answer to this may be obvious.
between the students when you first came here, the Big Cf,
generation, and this generation, the children of the Big Chi,

A: I think the students of today are more serious abq
preparing themselves for their careers. They want to be p
pared for professional activities for whatever job they we;
to hold, and they want to relate their college experience;
their own skills and their own intellectual ability. ,

I think they're also more sensitive to social issues.

Q: Even over those of the late '60s? _

A: Yes. There were divisions among young people a gen.
ation ago with some being, in respect to let's say civil righ
conservative and some being liberal. ,

I think that the liberal viewpoint has been incorporat
into the mainstream.

Q: But with these students today being more serious abc
careers and so forth, I would think that those of a generati-
ago do have active careers by this point. Do you think ti
generation, the one preparing itself now, is going to be 0
composed of more "movers and shakers” than the previoi

A: Yes, I think that you'll have more impact in relation
some of the others in that past period.

There was a rather significant movement of belief that e(
cation was irrelevant, that diligence and application of
fort were not the adequate social norms and that sitting unc
a tree was a more fulfilling experience than reading a bo
in the library.

I think that those people who rejected society in p
diminished their own future capabilities and their ability
perform.

Q: But with this new-found turn against complacency,
you think the generation of today may be becoming too c
lous? Is the whole thing cyclic?

A: I think there are always cyclic aspects of conservatil

and progressive values, but what I'm critical of in the p.
generation was the tendancy of some to reject society.

I do applaud the concerns over civil rights at the tin
which I think are vital and healthy today.

Q: Do you consider yourselfto run the University of Pit
burgh with an iron hand? .

A: I hope not!

Q: Have you basically dictated your own role as preside:

A: I think one has to be one’s own master in a fundame
tal way.

A: As a matter of fact, I might men-
tion one little aspect that I experienced

Just as.| was meeting with a black
educator, I noticed on the front page
of a paper he had that a group of Ameri-
can publishing firms, through their own
view of divestment, had decided to ban
and ‘cease distribution of their text-
books to South Africa.

That represents a total misunder-
standing of what our policy and what
our goals are about. That's mixing up
ends and means.

Education is probably the best hope
for long—term resolution to the
problems. Those publishing firms are
being blind and foolish to inhibit one
promising avenue to solutions, and
they certainly misread the views of their

But this is. literally an intellectu
community, and one can play a role

persuasion and building of consenst

I might use the example of the ne
Honors College. I had advocated SU(
an initiative for over a decade. But
couldn't work until there was a stror?
element among our faculty who reaI_
wanted it to happen and were willirj
to support it through their own co;
victions. ;

Q:How about a little about yoi
What's your favorite movie? I

A:Oh, I don't really have a favori;
movie, but I can think of several thi
were moving to me in times past sutf
as Citizen Kane or All Quiet on tli
Western Front, but there were mar

constituents.

Well, they're going to hear from me!

Q: Ideas on and about education itself have certainly
changed more than a few times since you first came here.
What are some problems you see now with education?

A: I think with the advent of television a generation ago,
we experienced a decline in the quality of our literacy, and
written or oral expression on the part of our young people.
And 10 or 15 years ago, it worried me deeply because the
trend was downward.

But I think it has now been reversed. I think that young
people, exemplified by you [pointing to this author], are in-
terested in writing and the quality of writing and speaking,
and that is leading to improving test scores and others.

I think along with it, ironically, we'd have to saythat the
quality of American television is so bad that people with any
intellectual taste at all will reduce their interest in it.

Q: In education, you've basically seen all sides — as stu-
dent, educator and now overseer. The students have changed

others. _

I don’t think they make the percentage of good ones
day as they used to.

I also enjoyed Dr. Strangelove immensely because it v
a great satire and, having been involved in issues of militg
strategy and nuclear deterrence and so on as one of my fie’
of expertise, I especially appreciated the marvelous satire tl
it was.  I

Q:You've got a whole new class coming in again — tl
class of 1991 . What advice from your 21 years here can yij,
give to their possible four? 1

A: Well, I'll tell them what I've said to my own childri
—— that these four years are much more important than I c;
probably make you believe because they will shape yourfé

titudes and opportunities in later life that you can't foresl

or visualize.
But perhaps it's just as well that you don't have that sen;
of import because it might even be frightening._ 1‘
But it's really very important to take the experience sci
ously and to take advantage of every opportunity to lea;

Annual  
Awards

7 recognize

teachers

Nominations for the fifth
annual Chancellor's Distin-
guished Teaching Awards are
due in the Office of Faculty
Development by Oct. 15.

These are the only
university-wide awards for
teaching excellence and are
the highest honor that is given
to faculty members for their
teaching accomplishments.

Nominations of faculty
members will be accepted
from alumni or any of six other
sources: faculty colleagues,
department chairs, deans, offi-
cially recognized student
organizations, CAS student
advisors, and ad hoc groups of
five or more students. Faculty
members in all schools are
eligible to win. The maximum
of eight annual awards rep-
resents about 2 percent of the
eligible faculty at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. ~

To be eligible for a teaching
award, a faculty member must
be full-time, have a minimum
of three years college teaching
experience (not necessarily all
at Pitt) and normally handle six
‘credit hours per year of per-
sonally conducted,
clinical instruction and evalu-
ation of students.

Eligibility will be checked
by OFD; thus, the nominator
need not be certain_of all the
nominee's qualifications.
Faculty members who have

‘been nominated in previous
years but did not win may be
nominated again. _

A typewritten nomination
letter, at least 500 words in
length but not more than two
pages of single-spaced type,
should be sent to the Office of
Faculty Development, 3600
Cathedral of Learning, Pitts-
burgh, Pa. 15260.

The nominator(s) must sign
the -letter, include his or her
telephone number and ad-
dress, and state the nature of
the affiliation that he or she
has had with the nominee.

In the case of nomination by_
an officially recognized stu-
dent organization, all officers
of that organization must sign
the letter. Nominations that
cannot be confirmed because
of illegible signatures or
improper nominator identifi-
cation will be rejected. Only
one nomination will be
accepted from any one nomi-
nator or group.

The nomination letter
should show clearly how, in
the opinion of the writer(s), the
faculty member is a truly out-
standing teacher in all or most
of the many measures of
teaching quality.

Judging will be done by a
board chaired by Robert L.
Wolke, director of OFD, who
serves as an ex'officio, non-
voting member. The voting
judges will be three faculty
members appointed by the

provost plus the president of '

the Alumni Association and

Price of college soars nationwide 

Editor's Note: The University
of Pittsburgh has raised its under-
graduate tuition 8.1 percent for
the 1987-88 academic year. This
means that students who can
afford to go to college must come
up with an extra $250 a year —
which makes tuition $3,350.
However, the University of Pitts-
burgh is far from alone in increas-
ing the costs of post-secondary
education, as you will discover
by reading the following.

NEW YORK (AP) ~ College
tuitionswill continue to climb
faster than the inflation rate this
fall, and total student expenses at
some elite institutions will top
$18,000.

Average annual tuition_and fees
have been expected to climb 8
percent at private, four-year col-

leges and 6 percent at public

institutions, the seventh straight
year such costs will outpace
inflation, according to the Col-
lege Board's annual survey of col-

1 lege costs.

At the nation's most expensive
school, tiny Bennington College
in Bennington, Vt., total estimat-
ed costs will reach $19,390.

Average total estimated costs at
all four-year private schools will
be less than $12,000 and at pub-
lic schools will be almost $5,800.

This fall marks the third con-
secutive year of 8 percent tuition
and fee hikes at private, four-year
institutions. The 6 percent aver-
age increase at public, four-year
colleges equalled last year's rise
but was less than the 9 percent
increase in 1985-86.

College costs thus continueto

surge ahead of the overall infla-
tion rate as measured by the Con-
sumer Price Index that has risen
at a seasonally adjusted 5.4 per-
cent rate so far in 1987. Inflation
has stood at 4 percent or less
every year since 1982.

Education Secretary William
Bennett, a frequent critic of
increases in college costs, said of
this latest survey, ”There they go
again and again and again. When
will they ever stop?”

Still, this fall's increases are
well below the peak reached in
the 1982-83 academic year when
tuitions rose an average 20 per-
cent at public colleges and 13

' percent at private schools — at a

. -

time when the inflation rate was
just 3.8 percent.

"The College Board does not
collect data on why tuition and
fees are rising, but other investi-
gators point to the considerable
increase in the price of goods and
services purchased during the
1980s such as books, faculty
salaries and scientific equip-
ment,” said board President
Donald M. Stewart.

Using a new method of cal-
culating average college costs
that takes each school’s‘enroll-
ment into account, the board
estimated that average ”fixed
charges” at private, four-year
institutions — tuition, fees, room
and board — will hit $10,493 for
1987-88. Counting» incidental
expenses such as books, supplies

and transportation, estimated-

annual costs rise to $11,982 for
students living on campus and to
$10,1 73 for commuting students.

At four-year public institutions,
tuition, fees, room and board will
average $4,104 for in-state stu-
dents. Adding incidental
expenses increases the estimate
to $5,789 for resident students

and $4,554 for commuters. ’ ’

Fixed charges at private two-
year institutions -will rise by 6 per-
cent to $6,945 — but will reach,
$8,305 for residents and‘ $6,737?
for commuters counting inciden-§
tal estimated expenses. 5' 

At public two-year colleges,
average tuition and fees will.
increase by 5 percent to $687,?
but the total annual tab hits an
estimated $3,889 for commuters

counting board expenses, books, -

transportation and other inciden-
tal expenses. The study gave no
comparable estimates for resident
students because the samplewas
too small. ' ‘

Besides Bennington, schools
where the total estimated tab will
exceed $18,000 include Sarah
Lawrence College, Barnard Col-
lege, University of Chicago,
Columbia College, Harvard-
Radcliffe College, Dartmouth
College, Tufts University and the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology.

Dennis Brutus is perhaps the
most visible symbol at the
University of Pittsburgh,

. representing those who strongly

support the dismantling of apart-
heid in South Africa.

Brutus, a South African affairs
expert, poet, and chairman of the
black studies department, recent-
ly returned from his latest jour-
ney, a trip to Nicaragua where he
met with Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega.

Brutus is opposed to the Con-
tras, a group of U.S.—backed insur-
gents attempting to overthrow the
present military junta, which cur-

rently receives a vast majority of-

its military support from the
Soviet Union.

”The Contras are seeking to

government.

’/The [Nicaraguan] people, I
believe, have the right to deter-
mine their own political destiny
— without the terrible attacks
they have suffered,” said Brutus.

He said he is hoping that his
visit to Nicaragua can help to per-

-suade the American people to
oppose the continued U.S. sup-
port of the Contras.

The group aimed at dismantl-
ing the system of apartheid, the
African National Congress, has
practiced an ”undesirable solu-
tion” to the problem of apartheid,
according to Brutus.

ca, we will have to dismantle the

”Violence becomes a case of

divestment from South Africa,
Brutus said  doubts whether
the implementation of a timetable
for the divestiture of funds from
South Africa would prove ef-
fective.

While he heartily approves of
foreign divestment from South
Africa, Brutus said a combination
of political, financial and perhaps
even military pressure will prove
to be the most effective means of
dealing with the Botha gov-
ernment.

As a result of his political activ-
ism in South Africa, Brutus was
imprisoned for a time with Nel-
son Mandela, the 69-year-old
activist to whom many blacks in
South Africa lookrfor guidance in
resisting the present Botha
regime.

The two men worked together
before both were eventually
incarcerated for what the govern-
ment describedas ”subversion
against the South African state” in
1964.

Brutus characterized Mandela

as a man of great courage, with .

a strong yet likable personality.
Mandela has been offered free-
dom by the government on the
condition that he denounce the
use of violence against the state,
but he has refused. .
If there is any criticism of
Mandela by Brutus, it is the lat-
ter’s disdain for the use of char-
isma as a substitute for poltical
substance. '

swered as to how the different

Recreational facilities available to
students abundant on Pitt's campus

By Sue Donohue
For The Pitt News

Just because summer vacation
is over doesn't mean that you
can't stay active at Pitt. Racquet-
ball, swimming, aerobics and
table tennis are a few of the
recreational activities available to
students — and most of these
activities are free to students with
a valid ID.

Trees Hall is the universities’ --

gymnasium. There are 11 rac-
quetball courts to use (equipment
is not provided). There are two
gyms; one is called the large gym,
and yes, the other one is called
the small gym. There are basket-
ball hoops and areas for
volleyball.

Doug Hill, a junior computer
science major, said he thinks the
basketball courts will be in excel-

lent condition this year because-

of the work done on them this
summer. .

5 Assistant News Editor

For most freshman, college is
the first time they are separated

from home» and parents. Many‘

college students are, for the first
time, making their own deci-
sions. Some of the hardest deci-
sions to make are those involving
sex. .

How about a date with that guy
you spotted in psych and talked
to after class on Thursday? He's
so good looking, and he seems
nice. It is wise, especially for
women, to proceed with caution
before you agree to spend an
evening alone with the‘ man.

According a recent article in
USA Today, one in five women

' in college has had forced sex,

otherwise referred to as ”date
rape.” '

Before jumping into the
swinging-singles scene, freshman
as well as other college students
must consider and learn more
about human sexuality and
reproduction. “

Planned Parenthood, a special-
ized reproductive health care
service located on Ninth Street in
Pittsburgh, provides medical and
educational‘ services’ that guide,
help and counsel the ”forgotten
freshman.”

Most "freshman are between the
ages of 17 and 19. At that age,
freshman have reached a cross-
road — they are no longer consi-
dered teens,’ nor are they
considered mature adults.

According to a survey conduct-
ed by Planned Parenthood in

1985, 2,256 18- and 19-year-old-

women were reported as preg-
nant in Allegheny County as
compared to only 1,682 pregnant
teens under the age of 18.

ed and are like new.”

The weight room lends itselfto
muscle toning and body building.
It has free weights as well as nau-
tilus equipment. Trees Hall also
has an Olympic-sized swimming
pool, plus a smaller pool, both
available for use by students.

The hours for the pool, as well

as the. other facilities at Trees»

Hall, will be posted in the lobby
of the building. Be sure to check
the schedule for the best times.
The student union's» recreation
center has a pool hall equipped
with 15 pool tables, located on
the’ ground floor of the William
Pitt Union. The charge for a table
and all the equipment is $2 per
hour. The attendents are helpful
in getting tables for everyone, but
keep in mind that lunch time and
the after-dinner crunch are the
two busiest times of the day.
Also located in the center are

four ping-pong tables. The pad-

dles are free to use, and the

charge for a ball is 50 cents. You
are welcome to bring you own
equipment. -

The hours for the center are
Monday through Friday from 8
a.m. to ll p.m., Saturday from 9
a.m. to midnight and Sunday
from 4 to 10 p.m.

tle bit of country in.the city. It is
also a great place to go walking

scenery of the park.

Besides throwing Frisbee on
Flagstaff Hill, you can also play
a round of golf on the park's
18-hole golf course. A person can
play the entire course, all I8
holes, for $4 on weekends and
50 cents less during the week.
The course is also open all year
long, except on the days that it
snows.

There is a friendly atmosphere
at Forbes Fitness Center, a health

and exercise club in Oakland.

aerobic classes from beginner to
ultra-advanced.

you with determining an
appropriate exercise program to
help you shape up or to stay in
shape. There is also a tanning
salon available to members.

Money is an enigma. Whether you get yours by begging on Forbes
Avenue (Spare any change?) or flipping Big Macs at McDonalds, it's _ d”
all the same — cold hard cash. Money can buy a lot of things. Whether 
you have a lot or a little, most of it's going to be spent sooner or
later — especially while you're in college.

Below is a list of prices of a variety of items for those with not—so-
much moola and for those who have lots. Not everything is for sale,

”Having social acceptance,

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 31, 1987

Student tells tales
of travel in Oakland

By Mark R. Brown

Staff Writer

A lot of folks on campus miss
Judd, the long-time driver of the
campus bus. The bus was even
known for a long time as the
"Judd bus," and Judd was affec-
tionately known to a few of us as
"Judd the Hutt.” He always
managed to engage anyone with-
in earshot with witty conversation
— especially on sports, a favorite
topic.

Those who knew him, miss
him, even though he never once

had that bus operating on sched- '

ule. It was more of a mobile talk
show on sports than a modem
means of transportation;

The campus bus has seen. its
share of animal life onboard,
especially since the new frater-

' nity complex on the hill opened

,‘

$0302:

up three years ago. I vaguely
recall being a passenger on the
bus en route to my fraternity’s
Halloween party two years ago.

I swear I don't know how I
wound up in the playboy bunny
outfit that night, although I did get

' mixed reviews about the matter.

Someone on the bus wanted to
see my costume, which, except
for the ears, wig and too much
makeup, I had managed to con-
ceal under a trenchcoat.

But the campus bus was just‘

one mode of transportation. From
what I hear, taxi drivers and dis-
patchers still get a chuckle

whenever they get a call to take
a young woman home from a
fraternity house. I guess some of
them had gone to college, too.
There are just some nights when
it doesn't make sense to walk
home, like if it's further than a
block or uphill — or downhill.
My friends and I used to be too
lazy to walk from Craig Street to
University Drive. Thanks to Yel-
low Cab, it was only $2. What a

‘bargain.

PAT buses, on the other hand,

are my least favorite vehicles. I've —

never rode in one yet that has not
been abused by illiterate graf-
fitists. At least I can spell. The
seats smell like I don't want to
describe, and the artwork on
them —— next to the knife slashes
— isn't very imaginative. "Benny
luvs Lulu" indeed.‘

There is something about see-
ing a bus, to someone who grew
up in the frigid artic wastelands
of wintertime Pittsburgh, that
elicits visions of roaming
dinosaurs.

’ A primal urge often occurred to
me to bombard the bus, usually
with snowballs. This adolescent
desire is usually not curbed by
the post-pubescence of college,
so don't feel funny this winter
when you and your friends try to
do in a PAT bus. It's as natural as
ordering a pizza.

Other/ modes of transportation
include roller skating, which is

Think nudism, and you'll prob-
ably imagine bouncy volleyball,
sunburn in unusual places and
lots of smiles. And that's about it,
right? Sure, but don't forget arti-
cles on arrests for public nudity
and the occasional streaker at a
college graduation.

In fact, degenerate behavior
has come to be the stereotype of
nudism. And publicity like the
recent court case in New York
about a man doffing his clothes
on a public beach only reinforces
this stereotype.

The media tells us little about
nudism except for what it .lacks,
according to Curt Bish, former
president of the West Penn
Naturists.

But while volleyball is, in fact,
the preferred sport of nudists —
and it does seem that most
nudists do smile for pictures
(even when they're sunburned)
-— Bish said there's a lot more

behind (no pun intended) nudism
that hasn't made the news.

Nudism is having a tough time
being accepted by mainstream
society. According to Bish, true
nudism doesn't make the news
because it won't sell papers. ’'If
we took our clothes off and ran
through Schenley Park, we'd
make the news in a second. But
if you're not sensational, nobody
wants to hear about you. Nudism
is not sensational.”

Bish’s organization, the West
Penn Naturists, is Pittsburgh's
own nudist group. The group has,
at times, boasted up to 75 mem-
bers and currently has a member-
ship near 40. They meet once a
month in a spa in suburban Pitts-
burgh to swim, play cards and
socialize. They participate in nor-
mal activities, except they do
them in the nude.

Bish said he is a business con-
sultant by trade, but he noted that
nudists tend not to ask many per-
sonal questions of each other.
They usually go by first names

only.

He said he believes that most
people don't understand what
nudism is all about. ”Nudism
actually helps to build stronger fa-
milies.”

U. .
about ya — Curt Bish
The nudist movement .in
America began in 1929 with a
group of Protestant clergymen in
New York who viewed nudism
as a family-oriented and whole-

some way of life.
In Europe, nudism is a widely

accepted way of life that has been
practiced for hundreds of years.
There are countless beaches
along the European coastline that
cater to people who like to swim
and sun themselves in the nude.
Bish said he feels the public’s
misunderstanding of nudism is
mostly the result of bad press.
Nudists have come to be lumped
together with ”free beachers."
He said the people who are
continually arrested for taking off
their clothes on public beaches
are known as ”free beachers”
and are not true nudists, and that
this kind of conduct makes true
nudits guilty by association.
On the contrary, said Bish.
True nudists aren't _fOrcing
nudism on the public by stripping
on public beaches — they are
simply dedicated to the beliefs
that being nude is being natural
and that social nudism helps to
create a healthier outlook on life
and the body.

about our beliefs, they wouldn't

know what you were talking
about.” True nudism, according
to Bish, has a strong social con-
science.

Not surprisingly, nudists have
strong views concerning sexual
education. This aspect of the
practice of nudism has become
especially relevant since the
onslaught of AIDS.

-Bish said the nudist attitude
would be a great asset for teach-
ing children to respect their bod-
ies and their sexuality.

”Textbooks should be smarted

’ up, not dumbed down," he said

of the current attention to censor-
ing health education textbooks.
”We need to teach these kids
what life is really like so they can
grow into healthy adults."
According to Bish, religious
fundamentalists are claiming that
sexual exploitation and pornog-
raphy are the products of giving
children too much information
and are creating a society that is
f’too free.” As a result, the fun-

higher than they were last year,
according to the College Place-
ment Council.

For the 26 fields surveyed at
164 college placement offices
around the country, there were
24,990 job offers, down\24 per-
cent from last year, the council
reported. Starting salaries

' increased 2 to 6 percent for the

period between Sept. 1 through

- June 5, l987._

A Those who studied the liberal
arts benefited from the econo-
my's continued shift from manu-
facturing to service, according to
the council. Humanities gradu-
ates found a 29 percent increase
in job offers over last year and a
5 percent higher average starting
salary at $20,256. At the master's
level offers nearly doubled, said

‘council spokeswoman Dawn

Gulick.

”We’ve been hearing over the
years [that] they [those with liber-
al tarts degrees] have been
becoming more popular. Com-
panies are looking for people
with more communications
skills,” she said.

Just over 50 percent of the
offers for humanities graduates
came from the merchandising
and services industries. Women
from the humanities fields
received more job offers than
men, but the average starting
salary was lower, according to
the council.

_ The oil glut has apparently had
its impact on graduates, with new
petroleum engineers receiving 82

damentalist movement is fighting
to have ”offensive” books
removed from the shelves.

”We [the nudist organization
called the American Sunbathing
Association] want to propose a
system of education based on real
life -— not the fantasy world of
porn."

Bish said that a child exposed
to nudism will see that not all
women will or should look like
the models in Playboy. ”There
are plenty of sags and rolls at a
nudist gathering. It's more true to
life. '

”People tend to grow up with
unrealistic attitudes towards the
body. They receive the wrong
information when they're young
and, as adults, they can become
obsessed with the wrong stuff.

”Pornography_ is oriented
towards fantasy — it's not real
|ife..Kids need the information

that permits them to grow into
healthy adults. We want kids to
be normal and to have normal
values — which is exactly what
the Surgeon General wants,” said
Bish.

Nudism exposes people to
nudity outside of a sexual con-
text. ”The effect is to not create
eroticism. It's’ not erotic, and it's
not instantly gratifying. It's really
teaching to distinguish between
all of these — it's a healthy
middle-of-the-road attitude.”

For all of the emphasis Bish
places on the philosophy behind
nudism, a nudist gathering is any-
thing but serious. The people
come here to have fun, to enjoy
the freedom of not being restrict-
ed by clothes.

At first, the nudity is a little
shocking, but it tends to lessen
with time.

Six months ago, Bish was talk-
ing about bringing nudism into

Oakland and establishing ties
with the city culture. He even
spoke of trying to establish a tel-
evision show on the city's public
access network. But now, Bish
said, those plans will probably
not pan out.

’’I was apparently more willing
to branch out than the other
members of the group [the West
Penn Naturists],” said ‘Bish.
”They want to keep a low
profile.” .

As much as Bish wants to go
public, it seems the other mem-
bers of the West Penn Naturists
want to stay small and unobtru-
sive. They seem to be more con-
cerned with enjoying themselves.

Nudism is more widely accept-
ed in Europe than it is in America.

One of Bish’s dreams —— to have I I

nudism within the city itself —
has been realized in Munich,
West Germany.

have demanded the right to swim
and sun themselves in the nude.
in Munich’s downtown park. City
secretaries often spend their
lunch breaks without their
clothes in the city's park.

Bish said nudity in America is
associated with Liberty Avenue
and sleaze. ”We don't want to be
associated with sleaze at all.”

Eventually, Bish hopes to spark
some anthropological and socio-
logical research on nudism.

Armed with data on the benefi-
cial effects of social nudism, Bish
hopes to be able to push a new
system of education.

Every summer, the nation's
nudists gather in Beaver County
for a Superbowl of volleyball. *

There are somewhere around 20

According to Bish, this is .a

light of the year for many nudists.~ \

The event attracts thousands of
nudists to the Beaver camp-
ground.

"It's impossible to describe in
words or even in pictures some-
thing that has to be experienced,”
said Bish, ’’especially to a misin-

apartheid regime be dismantled.

”This is one of the main rea-
sons, as given by the government,
for its belief that blacks would be
unable to peacefully interact in
daily life,” Brutus said.

However, Brutus said that 50
percent of South African blacks
work in urban areas.

Brutus was permitted to leave
South Africa when he signed an
agreement that he would never

return. Violating that agreement
would probably mean immediate
imprisonment.

However, if Brutus were to
return to South Africa sometime
in the future, what would actually
prove to him that apartheid had
been torn down?

”The most obvious sign which
will prove that apartheid has
finally been removed would [be]
allow[ing] me to travel unihibited
to my homeland.”

Crime

Canine patrols were used, and
15-20 plainclothes officers report-
ed to the No. 4 station in
Oakland.

The situation was eventually al-
leviated with the onset of cold
weather.

This fall, Waters said the
increase in youths — mostly high
school ‘age — in the heart of Oak-
land_on weekends has necessitat-

Ill

ed more police protection. The
campus police are working with
the city police on ”impact de-
tail,” which Waters said would
be in operation until they feel it
isn't necessary anymore.

”From a law enforcement
point-of-view, the crime is pretty
much the same, but the number
of people has increased,” said
Waters.

”Police should be scattered

down to at least Oakland or At-
wood,” continued Waters,
responding to criticism from
some students who say police are
concentrated in front of ”The O”
on Bouquet and Forbes only.
”They should be moving in that
general area.

He said he is hoping that when
school (high school) resumes in
the fall, the situation will be al-
leviated.

”This [the hot brewing] basical-
ly takes eight hours. [The cold
process] takes about a month.”
Although the cold process takes
longer to complete, it is far sim-
pler to explain.

The main part of the cold
process is fermentation. The yeast
cells are placed in a cold tank.
The sugar solution is poured into
the tank.

”The sugar serves as food for _

the yeast,” said Carotta. This
results in a chemical reaction.
The byproducts of this reaction
are alcohol and carbon dioxide.

' This, for the most part, com-
pletes the creation of the Pitts-
burgh Brewing Company product
that may contribute to your han-
gover next Saturday morning. All
that is left now is the bottling.

litical science before taking my
first freshman class. That same
year, I decided to go into secon-
dary education with an emphasis
on the social sciences. And these
changes have definitely been the
right choice for me. But, if I could
be in a rock group now, I would
do that, too,” said Ruefle.

Junior English major Patty
Maurer said she was originally a
German/business major.

’’I was good at German and
wanted to be a translator in busi-
ness. But after taking German III,
I realized that I was not enjoying
it and changed my major to
English — which has worked out
since,” said Maurer.

I I In Pittsburgh employee
tells her side of the story

Service——

Continued from page A-21

According to Bruce Hutchison,
manager of telecommunications,
over 46,000 students will be liv-
ing in the residence halls this
year. This means that 'there_'must
beat least 46,000 access codes
processed.

When students arrive on cam- '

pus, the phones in their rooms
are already equipped to receive
phone calls outside of the cam-
pus phone system, and it enables
students to make phone calls
within the university phone
system. I

In order to make local or long-

distance phone calls, the access ,

code must be used.

Although there are 90 million
possible code combinations,
Hutchison said the code numbers
are well—regUlated and that it is
highly unlikely that someone
could randomly dial another per-

son's code number.

Since access code theft is not

I impossible, Hutchison said com-

puters are avavil-able to monitor
unusual activitiy of the codes. If
problems arise, a student is per-
m’itted to change his access code,
as long as student identification
is presented.

976 block placed

on campus phones  

In May, the University of Pitts-
burgh blocked its phone system
from ‘access to all 976 numbers.
This means that no one can reach
a 976 ’/porn line” or ”gab line”
from a phone operating under
System 85, the university's phone
service.

’’All Pitt phones — dorms,
faculty and staff phones — are
blocked,’’ said Huchison.

Some Pitt students denounced
the university's decision to make
such a move.

”We should have the right to
determine what call we want to
make,” said history major and
Pitt football player Mark Brasco.
”They are our phones while we
live on campus. We should [be
able to] use them how we
please.” I

‘ Others, however, agreed with
the unversity’s decision.

’’I don't think the university
should have to take responsibility
for students’ 976 calls,” said
Stacey Schaeffer, a communica-
tions major.

Editor's Note: The following is
a letter that was submitted to The
Pitt News for publication by an
employee of In Pittsburgh. It
does not necessarily express the
opinion of The Pitt News.

As a classified director and,
consequently, ”the personals
lady” of In Pittsburgh weekly, I
feel compelled to voice my own
views on the controversial 976
numbers and the personal ads.
I've read all the letters and
listened to all the feedback con-
cerning the content of In ‘Pitts-
burgh's infamous classified
section. Now, I'd like a chance to
speak.

First, let's look at the 976 num-
bers listed under the section of
the classifieds called Personal
Services. '

Expectedly, we receive a lot of
negative feedback about publish-

ing those numbers: The main gist.

of the argument is usually direct-
ed toward their pornographic

content and its availability to
children.

Personally, the pornographic
nature of these numbers rubs me
the wrong way. However, as an

alternative publication, In Pitts-I

burgh publishes what isn’t main-
stream, what isn't necessarily
readily accepted, what's going to
lean to the left, etc.

Hence, we publish these num-
bers as do other alternative
papers in other cities around the
country. Secondly, I don't neces-
sarily agree with the publication
of the 976 numbers but, at the
same time, I am also disturbed
when I am confronted with some
of the attitudes of the crusaders
against the 976 numbers.

They simply want to wipe out
those ”horrible, disgusting,
sleazy,” 976 numbers, and then
everything will be fine. Right?
Well, what about doing some-
thing aboutthe problems that
give rise to the publication of
those numbers — loneliness,

desperation, alienation, etc. What
about looking further than one’s

"own nose and treating the under-

lying problems, too, rather than
just tearing down?

Try some reconstruction. Try
exercising some sympathy and
compassion rather than a purely
holier-than-thou, self—righteous,
judgmental attitude.

OK, let's talk about those ever
so popular, widely read personal
ads. [...] However, again, In Pitts-
burgh is an alternative publica-
tion. Hence, we print those
personal ads that mainstream
publications won't. [...]

On a final note, you may not
agree with the content of some of
the personal ads of the publica-
tion of the 976 numbers. And you
have a right to your opinion. But
don't let human sympathy and
compassion and understanding
take a vacation in your fervor to
express your opinion or win your
anti-whatever crusade.

’-&:_;‘[t‘s time to quit the ‘clowning and reach for your Star.

On the value of finding and 
exploring new mental frontiers

t takes a certain amount of

nerve to have one freshman»

welcome another to

campus. Worse yet, given
the publisher's deadlines, these
remarks are being written before
my ‘permanent move to Pitts-
burgh -— though I expect to beat
the rest of the freshmen by a
month or so.

In spite of all that: Warm greet-
ings to you all! The place to
which I welcome you is a rela-
tively confined one: a few city
blocks this way and that and,
thanks to the unique Cathedral of
Learning, more than the usual
number of stories off the ground.

However, the actual physical
location where you will be
spending the next few years of
study is the most circumscribed
aspect of the career ahead of you.
To come to college is to spend a
few years having one’s mind
roam over vast spaces and times.
The intellectual traveling you will
do is significantly moreiextensive
than any possible bodily voyag-
ing. Moreover, if you are a suc-
cessful undergraduate traveler,
your roaming through a variety of
fields of study is likely to have a
more lasting effect on you than
any physical trip on our globe,
including such exotic — and
expensive — ones as a safari to
Africa or a trek through Tibet.

But not that you are in charge
of the trip you will be taking; its
importance to you is sufficient

reason for you not to hand over
leadership to another or to drift
without anyone in charge. You

are not alone: Faculty members
and fellow students can and will
offer valuable advice that will
help you make better choices.
Like travel agents, though, they
must be sought out by you, and
you must formulate the questions
you want answered. (Or, if you
are in a pre-question state of mind
— just puzzled, just wondering —
you must initiate the conversation
that will lead to the shaping of
questions and to the beginning of
answers.)

In short, you will find many
people on the Pitt campus will-
ing and able to respond to your
queries, but you ‘musn’t forget

 

that the voyage you are taking is
yours and that you must initiate
inquiries about the directions you
might take.

And the fact is that in the

.university setting to which you

have come, the number of possi-
bilities are immense; besure to
take advantage of that fact and
explore, without assuming that
you now already know every-
thing you want to do during the
next few years. The odds are
against your being successful in
predictingthat future: You cannot
possibly know about all of the
options that will face you at Pitt,
nor’ can you know yourself so
well as to anticipate how you will
take to these various, as yet
untried possibilities.

Welcome, then, to an exciting
voyage, an extensive trip of
which you must be in charge, a
voyage that is exciting because it
is one of exploration and dis-
covery. -

TO   fuzz-be or not‘

to fuzz-be muff?

ot pink polka-

dotted mini-

dresses were in

vogue when I was
a freshman. So vogue, in fact,
that I had one and quite often
paired the vision—in—bright with
black patent pumps, making
for an ensemble that was sure
_to inspire the best of clothes
designers the Mattel world
over.

Attention—wanton women
everywhere felt the pangs of
fashion when I wore that
dress; the creative latitude of
even the greatest of designers
allows for no more than what
a sewn fabric can offer — a
lifeless semblance of some-
thing that would look good-if
you were a department store
mannequin. '

 

FRANCES
SANSIG

 

Alas, I was not a manne-
quin. Therefore, in order to
compensate for possessing the
characteristics of a human be-
ing formed of the flesh and not
of the fantasy, I created the ul-
timate in wearing apparel —
the fuzz-be muff.

Now, you may ask yourself,
what is a fuzz-be muff?

It is perhaps the most versa-

' tile of outer garments you may
ever have the pleasure of
wearing.

. But only hip people wear

the muff, which, by the way,
operates aesthetically well
with virtually any undergar-
ment currently in your
wardrobe.

But before I tell you exactly

what the fuzz-be is, let me tell
you what it did for me.

As a freshman, I lacked con-
fidence, knowledge ‘ and a
sense of well-being. Some will
tell you I still lack the afore-
mentioned attributes;
however, there is a certain in-
alienable contentment I
receive from acknowledging a
previous lack of it. In other
words, I like the fact that I'm
better off than I was before.

Most freshman I've seen
have a certain distinguishable
characteristic that makes them
easy for me, and other upper-
classmen, to recognize — the
way they dress.

High school was a contest of
the appearance conscientious.
”How many'different pairs of
shoes do you have, Suzie?”

I knew girls in my high ,
school who must have been "

on a clothes-rotation schedule.

-You never saw them wear the

same outfit twice in one year.
I figured people who had per-
sonality defects had to make
up" for it somehow.

Things changed drastically
after my first year of college.

I decided the casual look was‘

for me. I found others, who,
like me, decided that many

a no-lose situation. It provides
a guaranteed boost for the

written. _

No matter how famous or
obscure, every columnist has
his audience. I imagine three

. types.

First, there are those who
bypass your ”art” in search of
the quintessential Beetle
Bailey or Zippy episode. This
is an admirable and honest
method of acquiring
knowledge —— one to which I
often subscribe myself — but
one that wins you no points
with the columnists of
America.

these are the people who
matter.

Standing in line in a fish
market one Saturday morning,
I began reading George Will's
column. I belong to his type-

three audience —- let's just say '

George's politics are not quite
what I have in mind for a free
society, though I do admire his
skill.

With my head cocked" side-

ways, I read as far as! could ‘

— something about Central
America or pastry, I wasn't
sure — until I lost the copy to
a more practical purpose.
Could George Will have been
used to wrap a package of
swordfish? If that-could hap-
pen to a columnist of George's
stature, what would be my
fate?

Through the years‘, I've seen
some of the great ones — Ellen

doing time as drying mats for
freshly rinsed paint brushes or
packaging for fine china. I have

witnessed the literary indignity of -

missing paragraphs, the result of
back—page coupon offers. Let's
face it, could a Bob Greene
column buy you a cup of Sanka?
A coupon could save you 50
cents on a jug of orange juice. It's
economics, pureand simple.

It is with this knowledge that I
spearhead my column, the kind
of opportunity longed for by
many journalists, all seasoned
with city-desk experience and
cured with the smoke of dozens
of four-alarm blazes. Finally, 
have the chance to speak" my
mind without having to interpret
the words of others. '

Yet, here I sit, staring into a

computer screen which’ makes
me nervous as I discover each
day what I really think, and em-
barassed about how little I really
understand about the world and
its problems. Thoughts of type-
one and type-two audiences
make me question the value_of
my efforts. But audience type
three, those curmudgeons of pub-
lic opinion, they keep me going.

I guess one of the risks associat-
ed with this exalted line of jour-
nalism is that while, as a
columnist, I am able to escape
the trap of the cosmic quest for
objectivity (which often locks
journalists into becoming mouth-
pieces for the ideas of others), I
cannot escape the fact that I have
become a mouthpiece for my

own ideas. And that increases my I

responsibility 10-fold.

I am not George Will. I'm not
that conservative, though conser-
vativism seems to sell these days.
I'm not Hunter S. Thompson

« either. I'm not that weird,’ though

I suppose it is nice to make the
establishment do the mambo
from time to time.

To_ me, writing a column is like
having a beer with yourself, as
you do with friends and col-
leagues. It's the gradual process
of sorting through the day's
thoughts and ideas. And during
that process, like it or not, the
lame often break bread with the
brilliant. The columnist’s job is to
decide which of the two he or
she is. And when you realize you
are potentially both, you're final-
ly on to something.

writer and columnist. His column

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 31, I987

The real story of Pit-t’s freshman orientation

t’s been exactly three years
' since I spent my first night
in Oakland as a Pitt student,

and it's hard to believe how
fast my first three years have
gone.

Now I'm a senior, and while
that gives me a feeling of pride
and satisfaction, it saddens me
somewhat. -

The saying goes, "Time flies
when you're having fun," so I
guess I've been having many
good times at Pitt. Three years
ago today — Aug. 31, 1984 -
seems like yesterday.

I'll never forget that day. It was
a Friday morning, and my brother
helped me move my stuff into my
Tower. B dormitory room on the
ninth floor. Room 913 —— “I'll
never forget that number.

I unloaded my stuff, met my
new roommate and went back
home to Monroeville for the rest
of the day to do some shopping.

Late that afternoon, I picked up

(my mom from work, and she

came to school to see my new
living accomodations.

"Quite small, but nice,” she
remarked.

Iwalked my mom to the car
out on Fifth Avenue where we
said our good—byes. It seemed so
strange‘ at the time. Here we
were," hugging and kissing. I
would only be a short ride from
home. Still, it was an emotional
moment. I'm the youngest of six

‘children, and my mom would
now be living by herself in a four-.,

bedroom house. Her only com-
pany would be our dog,
Duchess.

When I returned to my new
room, the partying began. Many
freshmen come to Pitt for a few
days in the summer to register
and meet people. I only stayed

one day to take my math and

writing exams, so I missed out on
making some friends. Therefore,
I had to pal around with my
roommate and his buddies that
first night. V '

We went to someone’s room
and watched them drink beer.
Not much fun there, so we
proceeded to one of the Oakland

' bars where we all got blitzed.

The next day, I woke up with
a nice little hangover and
crawled up to Pitt Stadium for the
football season opener against
Brigham Young. ~

I've always been a big Pitt fan,
although the football players
might find that hard to believe.

3 Anyway, Pitt was ranked among

the top five in the country and

-was favored to beat Brigham

Young.
The game provided one of the

first surprises of my college life.

Pitt lost. g

At the time, I was shocked.
That was about the 30th Pitt
game I had attended at the stad-
ium, and yet only the third time
I had seen the Panthers lose.

I didn't even party that night
because I was so bummed out,
but I got used to Pitt losing foot-
ball games real fast. The Panthers
started out that Season 0-4, so I
quickly learned to get over my
post—game doldrums.

Heck, beer was more impor-
tant than worrying about a foot-
ball game. »

At the time, though, I thought
that the football game was the
low point of the weekend. Not
quite. Sunday night, the RA on
our floor gathered all the guys
together to go over to David
Lawrence Auditorium where

 

 

JOHN
ENRIGI-I'l'

some guy was supposed to
preach to us about condoms. At
least that's what the RA said.
We never made it there._
We crammed onto an elevator
with some girls, and it soon

BL%M COUNTY

became obvious that there was
simply too much weight on the
elevator for it to land on any
floor. When the head count was
taken a few minutes later, 22 was
the number of poor souls
crammed into the tiny confines of
the stranded Towers elevator.
Two and a half hours later, we
were rescued. The elevator had
to be dropped partially below the

ground floor andpried open.

I was a soaking mess, as was
everyone else. While I was on the
elevator, I had taken my shirt off
and was pretty close to taking my
pants off also. It was that hot.
Thank goodness no one was
claustrophobic or that elevator
would have turned into the scene
of a real tragedy. ‘

That's what I remember about
my first weekend at Pitt. It's an
experience I'll never forget. I wish

I could do it all over again just to‘

relive the strange feeling I had of
disquiet mixed with. childlike
excitement. "

Believe me, it's a good time

being a freshmen. For one thing,
when you're a junior or senior‘
and most probably over 21, you
can hit the bars. When you are a
freshman, you create your own
parties, and nobody tells you that
you can't drink after 2 a.m.
' But I can't really tell any of the
freshmen what it's going to be
like attending Pitt. You'll find out
soon ‘enough.

There is one piece of advice,
however, that I will give Pitt's
class of 1991 -— don't get on any
crowded elevators. You might be

sorry if you do.

THE PITTNEWS, sEcrioN cl

Throughout the history

of contemporary pop
culture, much of the
population has suffered
from a longing, a feeling of
black emptiness that cannot be
filled. Certain individuals have
been successful at eliminating‘ ,
this void:

0 Elvis Presley in the 1950s.
0 The Beatles in the 1960s.
0 The Bee Gees in the 1970s.

And now, in 1987, the population is
suffering as never before. The afflic-

tion is great. But there is hope.

Replacements

An exclusive interview with Paul Westerberg before a steamy concert at Grafitti. The
Replacements may soon burst onto the commercial ‘airwaves, but Westerberg seems
to see the whole thing as kind of a joke.

Paul and Leni Gillman document the many

In his book The Battle of Brazil lack Mathews

before appearing on American screens.

Zany Douglas Adams is at it again. His new
book is entitled Dirk GentIy’s Holistic Detec-

A new and improved theater season is to be
staged this year at the Pitt. The improvements
include a greater number of performance dates
and a season pass that includes both Universi-
ty and Studio productions.

 

The Pittsburgh Playhouse brings Woody Allen's
best works to town for a month long festival
of his films.

 

One of the most original bands today is Pi-
anosauravs, a group that plays all toy instru-
ments. But don't forget Algebra Suicide, who
recite poetry to hypnotic guitar riffs. Other al-
bums include See How We Are by X, Kiss Me

Obituary: Showcase Magazine

Showcase Magazine, 8 years
old, of Oakland, died in April of
internal bleeding sustained from
four months of neglect. The
Pittsburgh Police Homicide
Department is investigating the
possibilty of foul play. Suspects
include all those involved with
the former personality.

Ms. Showcase was the popular
entertainment supplement to
The Pitt News, the official
student-run, campus newspaper
of the University of Pittsburgh.

She wasn't highly respected in
more serious-minded circles, as
she routinely became involved

with such disreputable individu-

als as The Butthole Surfers, The '

Hard-Ons, The Damned and Mr.
Rogers.

Survivors include her last edi-
tor, a small handful of writers, an
entertainment section and scores
of former readers.

Friends will be received week-
days from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at The
Pitt News, 441 William Pitt

Freddie Freshman comes to Pitt and
makes important discovery: fast-food
places and bars in Oakland heartlessly
devour the money of unsuspecting fresh-
men at rates never before recorded in
history.

Imagine if. A young, somewhat inno-
cent Freddie comes to the ’Burg for an
education -— and boy, does he get
educated.

First there's orientation, meeting new
people, discovering the Oakland bar
scene, finding the  stumbling into
Primanti’s and, of course, the tailgating
games. Freddie's
escapades are such fun during September,
October and November. Too much fun.

Alas, on a day in mid-November, Fred-
die realizes this fun has it's price (and it's

I a very high price).

A summer savings goes down easier
than a Michelob and faster than a small
order of ”O” fries at a party of 20.

SUSAN
WASHBURN

The result: a long, bitter winter of
rationing good times and money so that
Freddie can successfully make it through
the school year without having to (gasp!)
get a job.

So, Freddie learns (asl learned) how to
survive in Oakland for well under $7 a
week. First, eating cafeteria dinners
becomes a must.

Fill up on rolls and pasta. They lay
longer in the stomach than the other food.
Having that full feeling cuts down on the
amount of alcohol comsumed and helps
curb the craving for food at the end of the
night. _

If eating out is a must, try to avoid
places like Pizza Hut and Rax — too

THE PlTT NEWS, Monday, August 31, 1987

expensive. Instead opt‘ for McDonalds or
the ”O,” they offer more food for less
money. '

If impressing a date is on the weekly
agenda, ask him/her to go out for ice
cream at Dave and Andy's rather than
dinner somewhere.

Then, go for a walk through Schenley
Park (free) or to The Carnegie ($1 per per-
son) instead of out for drinks or dancing.
The Carnegie is a nice option in the warm
weather because it is air-conditioned. So
is Hillman Library -— suggest studying

I together.

These are all good weekday events, but
the weekend needs a little more excite-
ment. The Pitt Program Council sponsors
movies in David Lawrence Auditorium on
a regular basis.

The movies are only $1 for Pitt students
and provide a good beginning for the

10 bucks a week not glam-orous, but it can be fun

evening. After that, head for a party in-
stead of a bar. It's better to give $2 at the
door than topay a cover charge and then
buy drinks.

Another option is to see a production
at the Studio Theater in the basement of
the Cathedral. Tickets are cheap (under
$5), and the productions are usually
worthwhile viewings.

Fraternities are a wonderful option for
females. They cost nothing (usually), have
dance floors and plenty of male company.
Guys, however, must be on a guest list.
Once in, though, there are no other costs.

Living in Oakland on under $1 0 a week
can't be glamourous, but it can still be
fun. Just know where to go and how to
spend wisely. Take heed, Freddie Fresh-
man, don’t try to have your cake and eat
it, too —— save it for the cold winter
months.

MICHELE

KIRALY

I heard of two movies with fall
release dates. One stars Kevin
Costner (Untouchables) playing a
military man. California

Dreamin’ is a story about-

Michelle Phillips of the 19605
band The Mammas and the
Pappas.

But don't fret, not all the art is
like the summer smashes. Some
directors still produce films that
do what they were originally con-
ceived to do way back in France
in the 18905. Then film began
with two notions: the realist
school and the formalist school.
The first sought to virtually hold
a mirror to life. Some of the earli-
est movies depicted ordinary

things, such as a family eating

breakfast or workers leaving a

_ factory at quitting time. They cap-

tured on film every—day events.

Slowly, filmmakers began to
record grand events such as the
coronation of England's queen,
which must have been fantastic
to attend and even more fantas-
tic to watch later.

It was then that filmmakers
realized they could reconstruct
historic moments and even cre-
ate certain things. Thus, the for-
malist school. came about,
bringing a presentation of a
remarkable, fantasy world. Often
fairy tales were made into
movies, way back in the 19th
century, and the eruption of Mt.
Vesuvius was recreated in the
early 1900s using miniatures.

The '30s brought sound to the
silver screen and, some time in
the '50s, color was added. Dur-
ing the time since then, a streak
of realism flourished in the post-
World War II era. The Vietnam
War brought an idealist, escapist
style to the late '60s and- early
'70s.

This didn't hold. The 1968

Alias David Bowie
Peter and Lenni Cilman
Henry Holt

By Rebecca Clothey

Staff Writer

David Bowie has often been
referred to as rock"s most bizarre
superstar. This is understandable,
as his unusual lifestyle has not
been kept» from the public eye.

Perhaps the mystique began
when Bowie started wearing
dresses for photographic inter-
views. This may have been the
first time the public became
aware of how unusual Bowie is,
but his lifestyle was far from aver-
age before he donned women's
apparel. '

Peter and Leni Gillman’s book,
Alias David Bowie, includes
everything you ever wanted to

Bowie

know about David Bowie — even
some things you didn't want to
know about him.

As a child, Bowie watched
many of his family members
suffer the ordeals of schizophre-
nia. Three of his aunts and his
older half—brother were all com-
mitted to mental hospitals.

David Bowie also was one of
the first rock stars to publicly
admit bisexuality. But the admis-
sion actually helped his career.
Before he broke into the record
industry, Bowie had serious rela-
tionships with many of the men
who later helped him get to the
top. When he revealed his bisex-
uality, his music began to appeal
to more of the gay community.

Bowie further contributed to‘

his fame byinventing a false
lifestyle. He created many stories
about himself which the press

devoured, such as:

I In order to create the impres-
sion that he was someone impor-
tant while still an unknown
musician, Bowie lived the life of
a king by charging thousands of
dollars worth of clothes, food,
etc., to his record company,
Mainman. He held press confer-
ences in lavish hotels and had
Mainman foot the bill. The press
fell for his act and immediately
brought Bowie favorable pub-
licity.

I To add an air of mystery,
Bowie bragged about having
been raised in a very rough
neighborhood. But he was
brought up in a comfortable,
suburban residence. ’

IBowie professed that the
reason he has one blue eye and
one green is because he got beat-

en up while walking past a prison '

on the way to school. His eye in-
jury actually resulted from a

Novel proves Adams is still the king of absurdity

Dirk Gent|y’s Holistic
Detective Agency

By Douglas Adams
Simon & Schuster

By William Young
Staff Writer '

”Oh, now, don't underestimate the abacus,"

“ said Reg.

”In skilled hands, it's a very sophisticated cal-
culating device. Furthermore, it requires no
power, can be made with any materials you

' have on hand and never goes bing in the mid-

die of an important piece of work.”
”So an electric one would be particularly

4 pointless,” said Richard.

Now, what is this nonsense?
None other than Douglas Adams’

‘latest attempt at proving that he

is the king of the absurd. Those

familiar with Adams’ four-book
trilogy (yes, trilogy, according to '

Adams), The Hitchhiker’s Guide
to the Galaxy, will recognize this
dialogue as a trademark passage
that only Adams could pull off —

and he does.

Adams successfully conjures
up 240—odd pages of his non-
stop, nonsensical wit. He assaults
the mind with a stream of silly
logic disguised, curiously
enough, as the ”serious" parts of
the book. Craftily sewn into this
fabric is Adams’ patented humor,
which has taken great strides
since The Hitchhiker’s Guide.

The humor is no longer predic-
table. In fact, it seems Adams was
so afraid of setting up his jokes
that he sometimes interjects them
mid—paragraph for the sheer
shock effect. Or, he lets them
slowly tick on like a bomb timer
until the supposed joke is forgot-
ten — and then he explodes it
unexpectedly.

Adams still relies on pratfalls
and pie—in—the-face. jokes, but he
does it as well as ever, never giv-
ing the reader enough time to
wonder why something hap-
pened before the next silliness
occurs.

Those familiar with the Hitch-
hiker series probably wonder
where Adams could have gone
after conquering the universe. He
decided to go no further than the
confines of his own mind.

The story is quite predictable;
it's all very cut-and—dried within
the first 180 pages. Even the most
dimwitted reader has figured out
who the murderer is before the
detective, Dirk Gently, has.

The Battle of Brazil
By lack Mathews
Crown Publishers, Inc.

By Douglas W. Payne
Staff Writer

Terry Gi||iam’s name might

A sound familiar to a Monty
8 Python fan (he was responsible

for the show’s magazine ani-
mations), but he is regarded as
something of a legend today in
the film world.

Upon the dubious release of
his film Brazil in late 1985,
critics and insiders lined up_ to
see the spectacle that had
become a notorious icon in
the already deflowered annals
of Hollywood. ‘

-Brazil was completed in late
1984, on schedule and under
budget —— certainly a perversity
in the contemporary film
world. A

tor, 20th Century Fox, anxious-
ly released Brazil to critical
raves and tremendous au-
dience response.

However, while Brazil was
enjoying its European success,
Gilliam’s American distributor,
MCA/Universal, would not
release the film.

Universal President Sid
Sheindberg didn't like Brazil.
Yep, that's it, he just didn't *
like it. He felt it was too per-
sonal, too confusing, too

depressing, -too long and, in a '

phrase, ”interminable to sit-
through.”

Blowing his corporate bugle,
Sheinberg discovered a small
clause in Gilliam’s contract
that altered the film to be 17
minutes shorter than it already
was at the time of Gilliam’s.
final editing. I I

Threatening to have his own
hack editors trim the film, _
Sheinberg managed to arrest

the release of Brazil for most
of 1985 while Terry Gilliam
launched deleriously into war.

The exploits of the tug—of— ,
war eventually blossomed into
a Hollywood war and is now
chronicled in The Battle of
Brazil, Jack Mathews’ prosaic
account of Cil|iam’s artistic
demands confronting Shein-
berg’s business concerns.

Many American critics and
movie-goers were confounded,
perplexed or apathetic toward
what became the hasty Ameri-
can version of Brazil.
However, a small coterie of
fans still regard Brazil as one
of the finest and most impor-
tant cinematic experiences in
film history, a brillant work of
the visionary and visual as
wellas a narrative, yet surreal
landmark of sociological '
fiction.

The Battle of Brazil equally
applies to the latter fanatic and

can still appeal to the former
and bewildered reader. ' '

Jack Mathews, a Los Angeles
Times film columnist, has com-
piled a thoroughly intriguing
book for anyone who has true
respect for the art of film and
little knowledge of the industry
that manipulates it.

Of those to whom The Battle
of Brazil will appeal, it is
essential and fascinating read-
ing. This is a book that lingers
in the memory and is instinc— '
tively styled as if to draw the

reader himself into battle.
Mathews’ style —— simple,
direct and sincere — is rarely
condescending to the oppo-
nent (Universal) but just a tad
patronizing to Gilliam’s moral
minority. Certainly, though, it
is no secret that the writer, as

writers will, intuitively defends --

the artist and the artist's vision
of his work.

wordy account of the filming

Continued from page C-7

Final Cut, The Battle of Brazil
courtly documents the transi-
tory nature of the filmmaking
business and the conflict it
spurs with artistic determi-
nation.

To one not already
enamoured of the film,
Mathews’ text must seem like '
an extended piece on cor-
porate bickering out.of the
National Enquirer.

However, it is wisely sup-
plemented with an annotated
screenplay of the film in ques-

' tion. A wise marketing, move,

the inclusion of a screenplay
can attract the fans as well as
supply the curious film—goer
unable to translate the film's
diction-and jargon with a leg-
ible text.

At Gi||iam’s request,
Mathews has provided the
reader with the more favorable
European script that adds two
crucially narrative scenes left

. . ‘
Movies ——
Continued from page C-4

Vietnam War film The Green
Berets was released during the
conflict. Audiences didn't need to
see the nightmare both on the
evening news “and then in the
theater with John Wayne as a
commander.

Out of this escapist form, a
unique combination of both the
realist and formalist traditions
was born: science fiction. Which
brings us much up to date and
back to Robocop. Of course,
somewhere in the great era of the
19605 came advant—garde films,
which some label as graphic,

‘ nouveau or just weird.

Italiandirector Federico Fellini
was cranking out flicks that had
no real storyline. They were,
more or less, a glimpse into a life
or a lifestyle — the work or the
late artist and filmmaker Andy
Warhol. One of .his movies,
Sleep,,is a long reel —— about six
hours long — of a man sleeping.

Often the,Pittsburgh Playhouse
is a retreat for the like. Fellini
films are shown fairly regularly,
and some Warhol films passed
through this summer. While
every theater in town may be
showing the latest Bond tale. or
another Star Trek or Superman,

"one movie house is a welcome

change. I already mentioned the
Playhouse, but check out the Ful-
ton Theater downtown to see
excellent American and inde-
pendent made films. ‘ ‘

Here is where you’ll find
movies made by directors who
are still interested in.making more
than just funny or entertaining
films. Lesser-known names and
first-fi|m—made directors are
showcased, bringing new ideas
in films to the public.

I recently saw two good films
at the Fulton: a psuedo-western

' by Alex Cox, the guy who made a '

out of Sheinberg’s American
version (theatrical and
videocassette) of Brazil.

Mathews’ annotations, based
for the most part on interviews
with Gilliam, explain some of
the film's symbolic elements,
describe the aborted and elab-
orate fantasy sequences and
share Gilliam’s thoughts during
the filming process. A

Curiously, however,
Mathews has entirely avoided
an extended interpretation of
critical analysis of Brazil.

Although, at first, this ap-
pears to be a glaring void in
the scope of the text, Mathews
is not without tacit approval of
Gilliam’s plight or minor
editorial commentary along the
way.

In some ways, this absence
merely underscores the humili-
ty and respect of Mathews’
prose for Gilliam and reflects
his pride in defending Gil-
liam’s cause.

Lengthy analytical essays of
Brazil’s content, which are no
doubt forthcoming, would
seem out of place here after
one considers the author's in-
tention to remain impartial.

This shrewd and reverent in-
tonation in The Battle of‘Brazil
supplements Mathews’ purpose
in suggesting how art imitates

life and, antithetically, how
Gil|iam’s struggle imitates his
film.

Mathews repeatedly reminds
us that Sheinberg’s. repressive
maneuvers in ”the battle” so
perfectly imitate Brazil's
oppressive Ministry of Informa-
tion. Only after we first under-
stand that Brazil"itself attempts
to reflect an image of the
entire 20th century.

Mathews also has the temeri-
ty to honor Gil|iam’s acidic
sense of humor and absurdist
wit: each of the book's short
chapters are named after sug-
gested titles.Universa| chose

perfectly named Brazil.

Talk about absurd — If

bals? or only one of the very
worst, Gnu Yak, Gnu Yak and
Other Bestial Places.

Although Orson Welles’
butchered potential master-
piece, The Magnificent Amber-
sons (1942) seems lightyears
away from us, the lesson must
still be taught.

Books like The Battle of
Brazil and‘ Final Cut remind us
of Hollywood's corporate
desire to exploit the tastes of
the masses appeal to an in-
terpretation of demographics, '
while. it historically represses
and sabotages the work of its
talented and creative film-
makers.

Craftsmen such as Gilliam
and Welles present a great
threat to the Hollywood
mogulsconcerned only with

how expensive a film is, how
fun it is and how much money
it well make; they are willing
to fight for their creations, win
or lose. —

Frankly, I findit revolting
that brilliance and invention
lie at the mercy of corpora-
tions and the masses, but there
is no denying that an artist in
any field is often forced to
interact with the capitalist ex-
tremes their artlcan simply
ignore.

Fortunately, texts such as
The Battle of Brazil remind us
that the crusade to seek artisit—
ic freedom and creative in-
dependence is as vital to our
existence as understanding our-
selves and our world. -~

‘ Terry Gi|liam’s Brazil allows J

us to be awed and amazed
with ourselves, but patriots like
Mathews force us to recall
exactly how Sam Lowry made
it to Brazil after all.

courses in film production, his-
tory and theory, photography and
video. Filmmakers does more

than just teach classes. It takes

learning out of the classroom by
offering hands-on experience and
also serves as a public forum for
student work. A

Sreenings of work by students
and_professiona|s are presented
regularly in the Oakland Screen-
ing Room, 205 Oakland Ave.
(directly across the street from
Filmmakers’ administrative
office).

These free showings of student
work are held at the end of the
semester and showcase the work
from that particular term.

”There’s a lot of opportunity
here,” said Betsy Callomon, pub-
lic relations director. ”Often stu-

dent and guest filmmakers can

meet and exchange ideas.”
The Filmmakers Gallery offers
monthly photography exhibits by
students, and local.and touring
artists. This summer's exhibit fea-
tured the work of The,Pitt5burgh
Press photography staff. The
photojournalism show titled
”The Eyes of the Press," present-
ed shots of the real world includ-
ing its violence and peace.
Filmmakers stress that the
gallery is a photography show-
case, as opposed to an art gallery.
The organization travels down-

town to the Fulton Theater to
present high—quality American
independent and foreign films.
Recent Fulton films included
Salvation, a quirky tale of TV
evangelism and Director Alex
Cox's spoof on spaghetti-
westerns, Straight to Hell.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 3l, l987

New and improved theater season to be staged

 

By Susan Washburn

Assistant Entertainment Editor

There's good news for all of the
Intro to Performance students
whose attempts to attend» a Stu-
dio Theater production have
been thwarted by a sold-out
house. As a result of last year's
record-breaking attendance at
Studio productions, the theater
has added more performance
dates to their schedule.

Also, the Studio productions
will be included in the '87-88
season pass along with the Main-
stage productions at Stephen
Foster Theater.

The black—box theater located
in the basement of the Cathedral
is a showcase for both graduate
and undergraduate talent.

The Studio Theater is dedicated
to producing new and experi-

_ mental works. Last year, in its
regular schedule, the Studio.

Theater featured productions of
Amadeus and Eugene O’Neill’s
Moon for the Misbegotten, as
well as Slow Dance on the Kill-
ing Ground. Also . included
throughout the season are M.F.A.
one-acts and one-person shows.

The M.F.A. one-acts are a ser-
ies of short plays usually directed

by those working toward a _

Masters of Fine Arts.

The one-person shows are
short pieces written and per-
formed by the same M.F.A. can-

didate. These types of pro-
ductions usually only run for one V

weekend, and donations are ac-
cepted but not required.
Upcoming Studio productions

in the '87-88. university theater '

season are Spring Awakening and
Baby; in addition _ to _ these

"productions are one-person

shows and M.F.A._ one-acts.
Opening-on Oct. 28is Spring
Awakening. This production is

. directed by Peter Harrigan. The

classic drama presents a bold
look at the influences of adult
society on the emergent sexuality

of youth.

Four months later comes Baby
(Feb. 5 through 21), a musical
comedy about three couples try-
ing to start their families. M.F.A.
candidate David Weidman will
direct the show.

Being included inthe Univer-
sity Theater Season Pass brings

_ the Studio Theater out of the

basement and attracts more atten-
tion to the young talent that it
features. ‘

The other shows included in

”Apart from giving the studio

The City Theater Companyis a
professional theater-in-residence
that focuses on producing new
works by American playwrights
— like David Mamet’s, Glenn-
garry Glen Ross. Last year, the

City Theater broke attendance
records for its critically acclaimed
production of Mamet’s work.

This has made the City Theater
more familiar to the Pittsburgh
theater audience and also in-
spired confidence in the artistic
director, Marc Masterson. ‘

”After G/enngarry Glen Ross, I
feel more secure about taking a
risk,” said Masterson,_”even in
doing a play nobody can pro-
nounce/’

His comment is in reference to
the City Theater's third produc-
tion Principia Scriptoriae by
Richard Nelson.

The City Theater's season
opens on Oct. 7 with Danger:
Memory. The two related one-act
plays, written by Arthur Miller,

carry a powerful emotional_

charge while also revealing
Miller's comic abilities. Master-

son himselfwill be directing this

work. ,
Following Danger: Memory is

a crazy comedy by Bill Bozzone _ .

entitled Rose Cottages. This is

one of the first showings of the .. -7

play that was discovered in the '

company's Tuesday Night Theat-

er series (the series reads new_ 7

plays to an audience free of
charge). This piece will be direct-

ed by visiting professor Gordon

McDougall.

ples of a writer" are challanged

By Christopher Sepesy

Contributing Editor

Sometime around April 1978,

. i an impressionable 13-year-old
‘decided to go to a movie. He

called one of his buddies, socked
5 bucks off of his dad and

‘ trooped off to his neighborhood

theater. The marquee read
’-‘Academy Award Winner for
Best Picture 1977." He had some

0. notion of what the Academy

Awards were, but his sights at that
time were set more on the New

 6 York Yankees and his own base-
i . ball team rather than frumpy

Hollywood Iaurels.

He entered the theater, bought
the traditional Milk Duds (pop-
corn wasn't allowed at the time
because of the braces on his
teeth. But then again, neither

were Milk Duds) and Coca-Cola,

smiled at two seventh grade class-
mates of the opposite sex, sat

 down with them with sincere

hopes of a possible kiss from one

 

 
Secret affair with

of them (he was only 13), and be-
gan to watch this so-called ”Best
Picture of 1977.”

That 13-year-old was me. The
film was Annie Hall.

made and closely seconded only
by Apocalypse Now, the defini-
tive film'of the 1970s.

And so it goes. Now at age 22

CUT

Woody changes writer's life

Know About Sex, But Were
Afraid to Ask, but bounced right
back into the serio/comic phase
again with the release of Broad-
way Danny Rose. And, glory be
— just last month the release of

the brilliant Hannah and Her Sis-_

ters, his best since Manhattan,
brought my collection full tilt.

Perhaps you now may be
thinking I'm an obsessive idiot for
craving the screen company of
another self-proclaimed obses-
sive idiot. My mother does. She
thinks I'm nuts. She'll walk into
the room just as I'm polishing off
the 50th viewing of Bananas and
laughing just as hard as the first
time I saw it, and say,
”Christopher, you're nuts. You
just saw that the other night. Why
don't you watch good movies for
a change and for the first time,
like, say  Lost Horizon?”

Now, with no ill intentions »

toward Lost Horizon, how do
you explain that people walking
around and falling in love in
Shangri-La just don't cut it when
compared to a giant female breast
terrorizing a countryside? Or an
orgasmatron? Or a lobster behind
the refrigerator, which, maybe if
you put a nutcracker and a little
dish of butter sauce over here, it
will run out the other side? Or
just C-od — er, sorry,‘ I mean
Woody — perplexed with the fact
he may either be in love or have
a brain tumor, or both?

But it doesn't stop there. l’ll 

lose sleep over whether Woody
will get more Oscars, which, in
his own priceless fashion, he
couldn't give a toot about any-
way. if they don't give it to him,
and instead decide to give it to
”honest” little movies _like
Amadeus or A Passage to India,
you'll be able to find .me jump-
ing around the room screaming
something to the effect of, ”Wit
is dead! Wit is dead! Death to all
pseudo-intel|ectuals!” (This not
only extends to Woody —- even
the crappo Out of Africa beat out
the sardonically hilarious Prizzi’s
Honor). '

There's more. l’ll find myself
going on for hours about ”The
Academy of the Overrated.” My
friends will eventually hit me if I
ask them one too many times if
they've ever had the wrong kind
of orgasm.

Woe is me. What can I possi-
bly do? How do l~stop breaking
out at any given moment with

cynical commentary about

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 31, 1987

 

The Playhouse is full

By Michele Kiraly

Staff Writer

'Oakland’s Craft Avenue links
Forbes Avenue and Boulevard of
the Allies: the two major routes
used to get to and from the city.
' This street could be a short cut
if you changed your mind and
decided to return to town for a
night out. But why do that? This
by-pass could be the real ticket.

The street is just a short stretch
of asphalt that houses a funeral
home, a gas station and a theater.
1 like to stay away from the form-
er, and since I don't own a car,
the theater is my bag.

It's not ironic that the Pittsburgh
Playhouse Film Repertory has
such a clever address as Craft
Avenue — it's appropriate.

l:lIDIl:l

The Playhouse serves up cul-
tural entertainment like film,
theater and ballet during the fall

movies in its two theaters in the
summer.

There's a lot happening here.
And if you happen to walk past
the white building with tall pil-
lars, don't just write it off as solely
being a movie house. The Play-
house has an unique history.
From the early 1930s until 1969,
it served as a community theater.

During the summers from 1957
to the mid-60s, the Playhouse
offered movies at $.99 admission.

Then for two years, 1968-70,
movies were a full—time attrac-
tion. 1973 brought the end of the
films, and things stayed that way
until 1978. That's when an in-
structor at Robert Morris College,
Richard Rauh, was appointed
film director.

Now, after nearly. a decade
with the Playhouse, Rauh proud-
ly admits he has completed over
3,000 film bookings.

In the summer, he shows films
in the repertory’s two theaters:
the 460-seat Rockwell Theater,

Rockwell, and the smaller
300-seat Hamlet Theater, in
honor of Shakespeare's classic
play and tragic hero.

During the warm weather,
Rauh usually offers a film festival.
Recent showings included an
Andy-Warhol film fest in July
featuring the late artist's versions
of Dracula and Frankenstein.

A Rita Hayworth movie collec-
tion, including the steamy flick
Gilda appears in August. And in
September is a Woody Allen fes-
tival, featuring 17 of this director/
producer/actor's best movies.

This fine collection of films will
include some of Woody's early
productions" like What's New,
Pussycat, along with his most
recent venture, Radio Days. Rauh
has also added his three favorite
pieces: ‘Love and Death, Annie
Hall, and Manhattan.

‘'1 wanted to pay tribute to a
vital actor and director on the
scene, one who is an important
part of the American film indus-

choice of Allen as a fest subject.

The film director added he
could not get a hold of The Front,
an Allen movie about the com-
munist blacklistings of actors in
the 1940s.

He chooses each month's films
for the Playhouse’s regular reper-
tory from a variety of sources.
Rauh has catalogs from the film
industry that list numerous offer-
ings, keeps lists of personal
favorites, refers to old Playhouse
film calendars and reads the
theater's movie suggestion cards
(kept in the lobby for patrons to
suggest films they would like to
see shown in the future).

Another aspect of the film
director's job is assuring that the
films get to the Playhouse from

OOOOOOOOOOOOOQOOQOOQOOO

TAE KWON DO JUDO

Get in shape while learning an interesting

of good fun at a great price

the catalog companies. Rauh also
coordinates publicity for the films
and distributes the monthly Play-
house calendars around town. I

The Playhouse keeps an atten-
dance count and often re-shows
popular films. Rauh mentioned

thata Katherine Hepburn festival ‘ "

offered a few years ago drew the
largest crowds.

In addition to the Allen fest,
look to see a variety a films

offered through the Playhouse’s in

regular repetory. September
brings the French film Betty Blue
and a concert movie of the Grate-
ful Dead. Rauhtries to book films
that appeal to different types of
audiences.

hear everybody else's song, and
then we come on. I feel as if
there’s some kind of mistake
there.”

There’s no mistake. The
Replacements have yet to break
through the barrier of commercial
radio, but it’s only a matter of
merchandising. They play tight
sets of heart-pounding rock,
rhythmically switching into jang-
ly acoustic prances. And it all
seems so natural. They are the
hottest band on college radio and
are quickly crossing over into the
big time.

And they are rapidly maturing
as musicians.

V lead Guitar, Anyone?

When‘ former guitarist Bob
Stinson left the band prior to
recording P/eased To Meet Me,
Westerberg got the opportunity to

l take over the reign of the group.

Now The Replacements are more
tightly focused.

”l played a whole lot more gui-
tar when we first started than I
have the last couple of years. It's
just that Bob was better at lead.

But in the studio, |’d play halfthe
leads with him anyway."

.Westerberg is now able to
punctuate his lyrics with his own
guitar; he doesn't have to work
through someone else. In this
way, the music seems more emo-
tional, more real.

‘ 

The whole point was
that Twin-Tone wasn't
paying us, and we
wanted to make sure
they couldn't print up
more records.

.— Paul Westerberg

’’I’d’ always come up with ideas
for a lot of the leads anyway, and
Bob would just improvise his
own style.”

Trash the Masters
While the band's maturity. may

be apparent on vinyl, they prove
they can still be soreheads.

When The Replacements felt
like they were being short-
changed by Twin-Tone, their
former record company, they
tried to trash the master copies of
their first, two records. But it
didn't work out.

”We tossed a couple, and what
they turned out to be were out-
takes and some live recordings
they made of us. But from what
was listed on the box, we thought
it was the first two records.”

Westerberg now regrets ‘the
action. ”lf anything else, it back-
fired. It was written up like the
records were gone, and you
should go buy them. The whole
point was that Twin-Tone wasn't
paying us,'and we wanted to
make sure they couldn't print up
more records.”

Jobless Wonders

Off to Sire, a major label. A

‘ chance to sell a lot more records,

get more airplay and be hailed as
rock's next great saviors.

Tim, their first LP for Sire, failed
to match the intensity of the
band's previous diverse music.

The ever—experimental Replace-
ments became boring.

It might have been the change
of labels.

”We were surrounded a lot by
people from the record company,
and l have a hard time under-

_ standing what it is they actually
do. At Twin-Tone there were like_

three people,» and they were

swamped all the time. They never _
came with us, and now we're sur—'

rounded with people.”

Stinson (Bob, not his brother,
bassist Tommy) leaving the band
gave Westerberg the artistic free-
dom he was craving. Pleased To
Meet Me showed a mature side
of the band, and their willingness
to experiment was back.

that doesn't fit onto a rock album.
At least not in the way people
have defined rock for the past 30
years. it's a jazzy, lazy, melodic
creation of Westerberg, and he
had trouble convincing Sire to
put it on the record.

’’I don't think the record com—
pany wanted that on the album,”
he said, as he jumped into a fal-
setto imitation of a buck—toothed
record company exec. ” ’lt’ll con-
fuse people. They'll think you're
a lounge band, you know.’ ”

A lounge band? The Replace-
ments? But the soft melody does
kind of remind one of a stale
Holiday Inn eatery.

little to get what you want on an

The Cure

THE CURE
Syria Mosque
Aug.4,l987

By William Young
Staff Writer

Lips. Big lips, and lots of them.
That's the first thing you noticed
if you were lucky enough to see
The Cure play the Syria Mosque
(or anywhere for that matter). The
Cure proved to all that not only
does Robert Smith wear red lip-
stick and lots of hairspray, but
that he doesn't dance.

Smith didn't need to dance,
because he showed everyone
bewildered by his reluctant foot
shuffling that music is what The
Cure’s about. Amid lots of neat
lights and billowy smoke, Smith
and the boys started the show
with a blistering version of ”The
Kiss” followed by an hour and a
half of non-stop music.

They weren't allowed to stop
there, though, as the crowd
demanded three more appear-
ances and seven songs worth of
encores. For a tour that had been
going for over a month before
their performance in Pittsburgh,
Smith's voice showed no sign of
strain and never missed a note.
Smith also proved that even
though he looks like a waif, he
can beat his guitar strings into
submission as well as any pop
guitar hero.

The Cure’s best moments

 “did’ri't arways jcome with their big

name songs, as was apparent-in
the concert’s best moment when
Smith led the band through ”The
Snakepit” with the help of some
ornate lasers and lots of wispy

smoke.

Although they stuck primarily
to material from their Kiss Me,
Kiss Me, Kiss Me album, they did
manage to find the time to bring
out a few, although not nearly
enough, of their older songs.

Smith dragged out a. half-
hearted ”A Japanese Dream," an
elongated and guitar-ravished
version of ”A Forest,” ”The
Walk,” and a much modernized
rendition of ”Let’s Go To Bed.”

Although they played their
music with flawless perfection
and beguiled the audience with
so much fire and smoke, they
seemed to lack the enthusiasm

g They may lack enthusiasm, but
0 this band didn't miss a note A

and vivacity so apparent in their
videos. S_mith’s refusal to move
about the stage in any manner
other than to get a glass of water
may have disappointed some-—
but better no-dancing instead of
bad dancing.

The real missing element was
in Smith's rapport with the audi-

ence. He seemingly ignored the _

fact that there was anybody
watching his band to the point
that the only words he said were
the titles of the songs and some
half—hearted thank-you’s.

Psych Furs prove they won't
sell out to the Top-40 crowd

By Susan Washburn

Assistant Entertainment Editor

The Psychedelic Furs still
smoke on stage.

If there were worries that The
Furs would sell out to the Pretty

in Pink movie crowd, they dis- 0

pelled them rather quickly in
their'August concert.

Clad in black leather, The Furs
looked much rougher than their
last Pittsburgh appearance three

years ago.

The Psychedelic Furs gave a
harsh but exhilarating perfor-
mance, full of screeching guitar
and screaming saxaphone. These
were complimented by Richard
Butler's raspy, energetic vocals.

But, the concert was lacking.
Not in energy, not even in quality
or sound. What the concert need-
ed ——— well, what I needed —— was
permission from the Mosque
security guards to dance.

Yes, the greatest flaw in the
concert was the concert hall. The
Syria Mosque offers an intimate
setting that provides good visibil-
ity from just about every seat. But,
when forced to actually sit in the
seat, the concert becomes more

like a movie of -the band.

» I was lucky enough to enjoy
dancing to the first two songs,
then he came. The threatening
man wearing a white shirt and a

As the temperatures
remained in the 905 most of
this summer, reggae shows siz-
zled in Pittsburgh.

The original Wailers played
at Graffiti to an enthusiastic,
packed house. It was a remark-
able show. The Wailers were

_ able to sound like they still

had Bob Marley on vocals,
thanks to inspired singing by

Junior Marvin.

The band performed their
classics ”Rastaman Vibration,”
”War” and ’’I Shot the
Sheriff." A ‘

On July 4, three of the-five
local reggae bands, Chill Fac-
tor, The Congos and The Dub

proved to be more lively, but

Don't Xpect the distinctive sound on this album

See How We Are _
Elektra

ls X's latest album, See How
We Are really xcellent or an
xhaustive effort of burnt—out
punks of the '70s.
‘See How We Are marks the
debut of lead guitarist Tony
Cilkyson. He replaced, Dave
Alvin, who produced the album

A instead. (Billy Zoom, X's original
guitarist, left the band after their‘
' last album Ain’t Love Crand, in

1985. Alvin took over shortly
afterwards.) 3

The new shift works well
enough to pass for X, but Zoom’s
originality is missing. Gilkyson
offers more guitar riffs on this
album, but the lack of Zoom’s
distinctive sound is noticable.

As usual, lead singers Exene
Cervenka and John X. Doe har-
monize with their haunting
sound. A

Alvin makes an impact as
producer. He wrote one of the
album's best songs, ”Fourth of
July.” It takes a wrenching look
at broken love, with Doe singing
lead.

The passionate love song
”You” sounds like the song
”Drunk in My Past” from the X
album More Fun in the New
World. But few of Exene’s melod-
ic balads are present. This isn't a
plus for the album.

”ln The Time It Takes” is prob-
ably the 'fastest—tempoed song.
Instead of X's customary har-
monizing, Doe and Cervenka
sing the fast—paced lyrics simul-

 aa

Without the distinctive guitar of Billy Zoom,'X’s new album doesn't have the originality once present in earlier albums '

taneously.

This song is Gilkyson’s oppor-
tunity to demonstrate nimble
fingers. Because the song keeps
a fast pace throughout, it fails to
build up to a climax.

It's been 10 years since X was
on the forefront of music, and
maybe they still are. It's difficult
to distinguish the cutting edge
anymore.

Billy Bragg

' Back To Basics

E lektra

Finally Billy Bragg’s first three
records have been released
domestically — in a generously
priced and packaged two-LP set,
no less. All the lyrics and all the
songs are here for only $6.99 -
per the instructions of Bragg, ever
the conscientious socialist.

But the real story isn't the pack-
aging, it's the songs. Yes, they're A
political, but they're as much

about the politics of pregnancy,
the family, and new and dead
love as they are about govern-
ment, conformity and commer-
cialism.

Employing only his brash, ring-
ing guitar work (save the occa-
sional horn or guitar overdub)
and powerful, impassioned
voice, Bragg's work is equally
entrancing and affecting on songs
of social criticism (’’It Says Here,”
”The Busy Girl Buys Beauty”)
and human relationships (”The
Milkman Of Human Kindness,”
”St. Swithin’s Day”).

Bragg’s Lyrics are biting, some-
times cruelly beautiful poetry
examining real situations recog-
nizable in real life. ”The Saturday
Boy” articulately tells of how
romantic rejection hurts an
adolescent male,

The Back To Basics collection
demonstrates what a refined,
insightful artistic voice we have
in England's Billy Bragg. Don’t
find yourself without this must-
have set of intense, lasting

recordings. _ john Young

wrong with that, as far as I'm con-
cerned. Their lyrics are depress-
ing and a little twisted.

It's their rawness that I like
most about them. They made the
record in three days — and it
shows. Thankfully, they decided
against heavy production — it
would've ruined the band's
sound.

The inner sleeve is a list of what

I think are horoscopes from a
newspaper. The cover looks

‘ cheap. On the back, one of the

band members has written a
dense little philosophical argu-

E ment in favor of something con-

cerning art.
But when I put the record on,
I found some fun, raunchy rock

Sonic Youth
Sister
SST

With every successive record,

 

Sonic Youth seems to gain more
melodic sensibility while still
maintaining their noisy, gnarled

sound and ability to launch into‘

fits of complete musical abandon.

The Sister LP is no exception.

A song like ”Tuff Gnarl” begins
with an instantly engaging chord
progression, then ascends into a
frantic two—minute raunch guitar
explosion. Songs like ”Pacific
Coast Highway” and ”Pipeline/
Kill Time” are equally musically
schizophrenic. Their ability to
surprise and/or overwhelm their
listener makes Sonic Youth
refreshingly unpredictable and
exciting. .

The band employs numerous

instrumental sounds (from ”Kot—
ton Krown’s” a thick, flat wall of
guitar sludge to ”Schizophre-
nia’s” sometimes dark, some-
times jangly sound) and
considerable vocal range. The
whole band shouts along to ”Hot
Wire My Heart,” while Kim Gor-
don turns in a moofy, haunting
solo reading of the especially
memorable ”Beauty Lies In The
Eye.” '

If you've somehow been
scared off by Sonic Youth in the
past, put any fears behind you.
Sister is a varied, thoughtful
record of tough, original music
for the enlightened masses.

When poetry turns into music

Algebra Suicide
Big Skin
Cause And Effect

"It has been found that when the corpus col-
losum is surgically cut, the recipient of the
incision can either hum a tune or recite the
lyrics ofa song; the two can no longer be sung’
together.”

i — Lydia Tomkiw

Lydia's ficticious operation
may have created an art form.

Tomkiw, the singer (or rather,
reciter) of Algebra Suicide,
chooses not to sing in the con-

ventional sense. She recites origi— ‘_
nal poetry while her husband/

guitarist, Don Hedeker, provides
the tune. ’

Add an electric drumbeat, and
you have music.

But is it possible to create an
entire album of poetry and still
get listeners to tap their feet?
Surprisingly, yes.

I. Algebra Suicide’s Big Skin is an

audio—cassette collection of the
band's two previously released

iEPs, mixed in with some new

songs. ,

Tomkiw’s poetry takes a
matter-of-fact look at life and
death. She can make the most
disgusting encounters seem
funny.

In ”Little Dead Bodies," Tom-
kiw says the reason she doesn't
kill herself is because someone
else will have to clean up her
messy remains.

It’s a pain to take out the
weekly trash, let alone figure
out what to do with over a
hundred pounds of flesh that's
about to go bad.

”Please Respect Our Deca-
dence” also looks at suicide —
the slow, slow suicide everyone
commits unintentionally:

is that coffee you're drinking?
is that a cigarette you're smoking?

is that meat you're eating?
is that air you're breathing?
Have you no self-respect?

Not all of Tomkiw’s poetry
deals with death. But each song
is satirical and witty, and her sar-
castic tone makes the lyrics come
alive, even if there isn't any
singing.

Hedeker sets the mood with
quiet, jangly guitar work‘ in the
beginning of each song that
builds up to match the lyrics with
stacatto, Edge-like peaks and
valleys.

It's an entertaining and hypnot-
ic recording — especially for peo-
ple who have trouble sitting

through poetry recitals.

— Rebecca Clothey

To receive a cassette of Algebra Suicide’s Big
Skin, please send a money order of $6 to
Algebra Suicide, P.O. Box 14257, Chicago, it

dling and includes a text of all the songs.

Pianosauras
Groovy Neighborhood
Rounder

The members of Pianosaurus
play toy instruments exclusively.
But their instruments of choice
prove to be much more than a
gimmick on their sparkling debut
album.

Bianca Miller's toy piano

chimes gently and warmly.
Stephen Dansinger’s Smurfs’
”Rock And Roll Lives” set sounds
unique, dry drum beats. And

Alex Garvin's fishing line string’

guitars pluck melodically along
to the songs.

The combination of instrumen-
tal sounds and simple, ear-
grabbing melodies makes Croovy
Neighborhood an infectious,
immediately accessable feel-
good album, much in the Jona-
than Richman tradition. ”Going
Downtown" is perfect airy pop;
”Memphis” a rocking cover of
the Chuck Berry classic; and
’’Love Is A Two—Way Street” is a
sing-along extrordinaire.

It's always a beautiful day in
Pianosaurus’ neighborhood, a
place you owe yourself a groovy
aural excursion to. I

This band should keep silent

 

This band is boring.

The record has one good
song (and that's questionable)
ealled ’’I See Red.” The band
looks really tough on the
cover, but they're limp noo-
dles when they start to play.

They rely on chorused gui-
tar to fill out their "sound,
which has become too trite;
Their songs aren't interesting,

and they just don't hold up un-

. der the weight of studio

overkill.

The record lacks any edge.
The sound is so smoothed out
that it's barely there. It could
easily be background music
for a commercial or
something.

The Silencers have no ap-
pealing qualities. They can
play, but they don't do it on ‘

the record. They aren't attrac-
tive —— in fact they're sort of
ugly. They don't even have
nerd appeal for techno-
junkies.

I'm not sure who's to blame
for this — the band or the
producer -— but the record
came out flat and dull. Keep

your money.

Playhouse

Continued from page C-13

with all its crafty offerings even
better is its convenient location to
Pitt and low-priced shows. It's

- easy to reach the Playhouse from

campus; walk down Forbes
Avenue (away from the Cathed-
ral) for about eight blocks, turn
left onto Craft, and you're there.

Rauh likes the theater’s loca-
tion — it's convenient to the East
End neighborhoods and is locat-
ed in the nighttime hot spot of

yOakland.

Now about the price.
You can see a film at the Play-

house for only $2.95. And since
you can walk there, there are no
transportation costs. It's good
entertainment for little money: a
rare deal today.

Rauh believes the film admis-
sion charge is a reasonable price.
He cited other comparisons. ’’In
New York, a film costs $5.25 to
view, in Pittsburgh it's $4.25 and
at Pitt, movies shown on campus
are $1 with student ID and $2
without it,” he said. ’’It’s a fair
price for what we’re_doing here.”

For the bargain buyer, the Play-
house sells books of 10 movie

coupons for $23, which equals
$2.30 per film.

The Pittsburgh Playhouse is
operated through Point Park Col-
lege, which also directs the Play-
house Theater Center.

The first theater production is
the New York musical, 42nd
Street, opening in late October.
A children's theater also operates
fall through spring, with special
Christmas season shows planned.

Call the Playhouse at 621-4445

or walk down and pick up this
month's film schedule.

_ Continued from page C-5
Gillmans conducted extensive in-
depth interviews with Bowie’s as-
sociates, former lovers and family
members.

The details are unfortunately
too meticulous, even for the most
fanatical Bowie buff.

The book begins with the child-
hood of Bowie’s grandparents,
who seem to have little or noth-
ing to do with the outcome of
David's personality.

if you can bear reading through
his family history, it gets more
interesting after David Jones (the
future David Bowie), is finally
born. However, this is not until
the third chapter.

One particularly revealing fact
uncovered was Bowie’s admit-
tance of howhe met his wife,
Angie Barnett. In Bowie’s words,
”We were both fucking the same
bloke.”

The authors offer complete his-
tories of everyone who comes
into contact with Bowie during
his lifetime. This would be fine if
you're interested in using Bowie
as the subject ofla term paper. For
the casual reader, though, it is a
bit tedious.

country's biggest holiday,
much of the crowd was appar-
ently out watching fireworks.

On July 24 at Wilson's
Catering Hall in East Liberty,
Barrington Levy put on an out-
standing show — being urged
back onstage for two encores.

Levy was a late replacement
for Sugar Minot, who apparent-
ly swallowed a chicken bone
in Chicago a couple nights
before the show. J

Yellowman played at Graffiti
on July 30, and the crowd was
as excited as it was for the
Wailers. Yellowman slid from
a reggae groove right into '50s-
style rock ’n’ roll, playing Fats
Domino's ’’Blueberry Hill”
and Bill Haley and the
Comets’ ”Rock Around the
Clock.”

Everyone was skanking and
feeling ”irie,” an expression
Yellowman must have used 50
times during the show. Yellow-
man was a bit crude but gave
the wildest show of the S
summer.

The Dub Squad opened for
Yellowman, and played a tight
set of crossover reggae. They
played original tunes such as
”Tuscon Posse,” ”Dollar in
My Pocket” and ”Everybody’s
Life.”

The Dub.Squad seems to get
the best crowd response in
local reggae, and they have
the most original sound. Check
listings to find out where and
when they are playing, as their
shows are inexpensive to get
into. .

Also check out the SWAMP
band, Chill Factor, The Flow—--
Band and The Congos. You
don't have to pay a lot to hear‘
good local reggae.

mean look. The alternatives were:
a sit down or leave. Needless to say

I sat (and pouted).

So,_ from my confining seat I
watched The Furs and tapped m
feet. -

The concert opened with some
new material, ”Midnight to Mid-
night.” Here, The. Furs reinforced
their image by wearing virtually
the same black outfits seen inrthe
”Heartbreak Beat” video with a
cigarette dangling from the
guitaristfs mouth.

Next came ”Pretty in Pink.”
Luckily, it was not the synth-pop
version that B-94 loved so well.
The band let loose manhandling
guitars and abusing drums to jolt
the concert into high gear.

The Psychedelic Furs spent
much of the concert playing their
older material from Talk Talk
Talk, Forever Now and Ghost in
You.

Butler was a.crowd pleaser,
even though some of his move-
ments were too repetitive and un-
polished. He didn't hesitate to
shake the many hands that were
thrust at him. He. also proved
himself a dynamic performer. He
teased the audience into a frenzy
during the song ”Sleep Comes
Down” and mellowed them with
”Love My Way.” V

The summer sizzled (literally —
it was 90 degrees) when The
Psychedelic Furs played Pitts-
burgh and, even though I
couldn't dance, it was a concert
worth watching. '

The Cure expands repetoire
to give flair to latest work

The Cure
Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me
Elektra

Getting an injection of The
Cure in concert is an event that
must be experienced at least once
in a lifetime. But, if you missed
the concert this summer, there is
still a means of survival — listen
to The Cure album Kiss Me, Kiss

- Me, Kiss Me once a week or as

needed.

The Cure is not just another
good guitar—based, new-wavish
band. Like the others whose
names begin with ”The” and a
C-word (The Cult, The Call and
The Church), The Cure has an
original sound. .

Vocalist/guitarist Robert Smith
produces music that's a bit dark
and eerie on the band's latest, a
l7—song double album entitled
Kiss Me, Kiss me, Kiss Me. Smith
also ventures into some bold
vibes and screeching lyrics in this
album.

Take for instance ”Why Can't
I Be You.” The song is a cross

between a love song and an.

adolescent cry. This is only
appropriate for this band. You
really can't ever find a solid label
for anything they do —— “outra-
geous” is too farsical, ”wild” is
true but so is ”sedate.”

”The longer we go on, the less

similarities there are between-

what we're doing and what any-
one else has ever done,” Smith
said in a recent interview.

Even comparing Kiss Me, Kiss
Me, Kiss Me to last year's compi-
lation album, Standing on the

Beach, it's easy to notice that the
band has added to their musical
repertoire of instruments. On the
latest work, one hears lots of sax,
horns and, yes, even violins.
But, The Cure still turns out

I some deep and down-mooded

songs. The new ’’All I Want” is
reminicent of ’’Charlotte Somei
times.” With a steady strumming
and a moaning voice, Smith gives
a pure plea. But then, just when

you think that is it, the song 9
' pours: All I want is to be with you

again  just to hold you like a
dog.

”Hot Hot Hot” is "a groovy
dance tune with a strong beat by
drummer Boris Williams. It's
flashy, and like the lyrics say, ’’I
like it when that lightening
comes.”

The band breaks loose on elec-
tric guitar in a violent and vibrant

”Shiver and Shake,” where Smith
and bass player Siman Gallup let
off some steam.

Slowing the pace a bit are
”Strange Girl,” a twangy tune
with Smith donating some whin-
ing vocals, and ”A Thousand
Hours” that features a violin in a
peaceful and dreamy-like sound.

A long instrumental intro in
”The Kiss” has the ”expect any-
thing” Cure brand. The song
sounds deceptively like a love
song until Smith croons the line
”I wish you were dead, dead."

Out of the songs ”Torture” and
”The Snake Pit” comes an eerie-
sounding inward—turned Cure.

For those fans who missed the
concert, there is a cure, and it's
called Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me.
Buy it, buy it, buy_ it.

Floating not only feels good it is good. Hospital studies reveal floating is successful
treatment for many physical ailments. It stimulates the production of endorphins (the body's
own opiates) while reducing adrenal activity associated with stress and heart disease.
Floating has been successfully used in treating anxiety. cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal
ailments, migrane. and tension headaches, hypertension and chronic pain. It's the natural.
drug-free way to better health.‘ Floating has had positive results in behavior modification.
Preliminary research indicates floating causes a reduction or elimination of habits such
as smoking, drinking and drug usage. Floating is particularly effective in counteracting
addiction withdrawal symptoms. It can help you through the discomfort of quitting addictive

Relaxation and health. That's what we offer at Floatation Station. We want you to experience

THE PITT NEWS, SECTION D

 

Hopes are
high for
1987
Panthers

By Christopher Sepesy

Sports Editor

 

Well, Pantherfans, once again A

this year, as it has been for the
past three, the hopes are high for
your favorite team. .

Practically every major sports
publication around has the Pitt
team ranked somewhere within
the top 20 teams in the country.
Sport magazine has them at 10th,
while Street & Smith's has the fill-
ing in at 19th. Inside Sports and
Football Action both have them
at 15th.

Only Don Heinrich in his Col-
lege Football reports doesn't
think they'll break the top 20. He
has them listed at 24th.

(Sports Illustrated has not yet
been published, or at least not at
the time of this writing.)

Although at this moment you
may be thinking to yourself, ”lt
seems to me I've heard that song

before,” you may want to hold-
, that thought.

At least Pitt head coach Mike
Gottfried would like you to.

”Last year, we talked so much
about it being a transition year
and how hard it was to go
through something like that,”
said Gottfried. ”Wel|, those days
are behind us. Last year was our
foundation. This year, we hope to
go on and be better in many
ways.

”We wanted to go out this year

and get the best recruits we '

could,” he continued, ”and l
think we fulfilled our wishes. The
new recruits look really good,
and they'll fit in beautifully with
the rest of the team. The only
thing they need now is some
expenence.

”And, as for the whole team,
we have experience, but they're
young/’

A young team may not be
exactly what Gottfried needs right
now. The slogan for the 1987
season is ”You Couldn't Buy a
Tougher Season,” and that is bas-
ically true.

But a young team is what Gott-
fried’s got, and it's what he'll
work with.

The offense, more so than the
defense, seems the least in

jeopardy from either youth or‘

depth problems. With many play-
ers returning, Gottfried’s point-
makers at this stage seem strong
and able.

Quarterback Sal Genilla will lead the team this year. How he will do it, only time will tell.

The offensive line is one of
Gottfried’s most valuable assets
this year, and almost every starter
has had some experience. With
Ed Miller and Chip Backauskas at
center, Tom Ricketts at left tackle
and Chris Goetz and Roman
Matusz opposite at right, and
either Bill Cherpak or Dean

Caliguire at left guard, this is one '

line in a long time that should
show it is something to be reck-

 

oned with. .
And add to it all Mark Step-

noski, arguably Pitt's best player .

save Craig Heyward, at right
guard, and this line's strength is
increased exponentially.

At wide receiver, four well-
tempered players are returning.
They are junior Billy Osborn,
sophomore Reggie Williams,
senior Michael Stewart and
sophomore Hosea Heard. Also,

Gottfried said he may be plan-
ning on using sophomores Darrin
Gillaspie and Henry Tuten for
depth.

Osborn ‘led all receivers last
year with 33 receptions for 414
yards. Williams snagged 17 pass-
es for 239 yards (a 14.1 average),
despite the fact that he only
played in three games. And
Stewart brought down 28
catches, averaging 14 yards for

 Editor in Chief

 The Villanova and Pitt basket-
-_,~‘=_ball programs have developed an
y_-_int'ense rivalry over the last few
gyears.

71.. How ironic it is then, that Larry
jg Eldridge Ir., a graduate of Villano-
..va University, is Pitt's new direc-
{tor of Sports Information.

Eldridge, who was a sports
fpublicist at ABC Television in
f{New York City for the past year,
greplaces Jim O'Brien, who was
ganamed assistant director for

.f‘Un,iversity Outreach Programs at
. Pitt. . ,

 O'Brien had been Pitt's assis-
ftant athletic director for Public
 Relations and Sports Information
.:-*for, the past four years.

’ I Eldridge, 33, comes to Pitt with
qra wealth of experience in public
 relations and sports information.

 After graduating from Villanova
 in 1975 with a bachelor's degree
 in English, Eldridge went to
l,_L’aSal|e University where he
[served as sports information
lgdilrector and assistant new-s
l‘i'Tbureau director.

 In 1978, Eldridge moved on to

After six years spent outside the
realm of intercollegiate athletics,
Eldridge is happy to be back. ’’I
missed some of the atmosphere
and what Vince Lombardi called
’the fire on Sunday.’ I missed the
atmosphere and the chemistry
that's required in the athletic
department,” he said.

However, Eldridge said there
are not too many schools where
he would have taken a position
as sports information director.

But after working at four differ-
ent jobs in the last 11 years,

Eldridge felt that it was time to .

find a position where he could
possibly settle down.

Obviously, he sees that oppor-
tunity at Pitt.

”That’s one of the reasons I
decided to come [to Pitt]. I've
bounced around a little bit, and
my wife's expecting our first child
in November. So one of‘ the
things I thought about when I
heard about this job was finding
a place to settle into where the
cost of living would be a little
more palatable and where the
general quality of life would be
a little better,” said Eldridge.

"I've heard a lot of good things
about Pittsburgh,” he added.

The attraction of the univer-
sity’s football and basketball pro-
grams was one of the major
factors in Eldridge accepting the
position. "I'm impressed with
[Mike] Gottfried and [Paul] Evans.
They're different men, but they're

Eldridge got his start in writing
and public relations when he was

He» served as sports editor of the
school paper, The Villanovan,
but he also was a paid employee

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 31, I987

Cheerleaders beware: what you can expect

As another year of academics
begins for the serious—minded stu-
dent, another year of Pitt sports
gets underway for the contempla-
tive fan. '

As the latter, it is logically
assumed that because of their
passion, the fans will undoubted-
ly turn to the sports pages of their
favorite newspaper to furthur fuel
their understandings of the world
of athletics.

And, with no arrogance intend-
ed, this assumption stretchesthat
as a Pitt sports fan, as well as a
Pitt student, the person will be
reading this paper more so than
the rest — if anything, solely
because of availability. If you are
reading this column and its sur-
rounding pages right now, this
only proves my point.

What I would like to address
now, as a sports writer, to you,
the sports reader and, most espe-
cially, to all Pitt athletes and
coaches, is just what the criteria
are that we use in covering and
analyzing Pitt sports and just
what you can expect when you
turn to the sports pages of The Pitt

‘ News. .

A little over a year ago, I came
to this paper to be a staff writer.
In exactly two months, partly
because of talent and partly
because of luck, I was thrown
into the position of assistant
sports editor. This thrilled me. I
had already been a student here
for three years and- always had
been an avid Pitt sports fan all the
way back to the days of Tony
Dorsett when I was 10.

And, wanting to be a writer —
more precisely, a sports writer —

 

SEPESY

I figured this was my break. I
would be able to have more fun
with one of my hobbies while
gaining valuable experience at
the same time.

I soon learned it wasn't all fun
and games. The examples to
prove this are numerous.

After publishing a football
game story, two of the players I
had highlighted as ”not having a
very good game” refused to give
me an interview before the fol-
lowing week's game.

Once, while trying to have a
good time at a bar, and a second
time while just walking down
Forbes Avenue, John Enright, my
fellow sports editor at the time
and now editor in chief, was ver-
bally assaulted by a group of foot-
ball players ‘because of a column
he had written condemning
stupid mistakes they had made
during a game.

Another time, we had two play-

ers come to the main offices of

CHRISGPHER‘

this paper to complain that,
although a story was factually
correct, it shouldn't have been
printed because it would propa-
gate bad publicity toward one of
these aforementioned players.

Now, to anyone who is read-
ing this right now and thinking to
themselves that there is no legiti-
mate gripe we at The Pitt News
should have, I say to you, wake
up and smell the coffee.

We are here to report facts as
well as logical, objective opinion
and not to be a public relations
journal. If you want that, read the
Golden Panther Prints.

What must be realized is that
we are a newspaper, and it is our
main concern to honestly convey
to our readers as best we can the
happenings around them. This is
true of any section, but sports
seems to be most criticized for
doing so.

I will admit to the fact that, at
times, we, as well as every other
newspaper in the country, have
reported an event incorrectly. I
will take it upon myself to apolo-
gize for that now. But it only hap-
pens a small percentage of the
time.

I'm sure many people are
thinking at this point that we at
The Pitt News are spoiled, self-
righteous and misanthropic
idealists when it comes the posi-
tions we are in covering Pitt
sports.

This is horseshit.

Today, there are a lot of places
selling stereo sound including
department, appliance, mass mer-
chandising, and catalogue stores.

Most of these stores have two
things in common. First, they do not
sell expensive state of the on com-
ponents so they rarely get to hear

nice people they employ, who also
sell refrigerators, lawn mowers, and
coffee pots, are not the ones from
whom to get the correct advice
about stereo Their good intentions
are not a substitute for a real
knowledge about sound.

Opus One is the dealer for the
best sounding equipment in the

the world's finest sounds. Second, the

world. Our staff knows what is impor-
tant for great sound and what is not.

Our $499 stereo system
does not sound like
an appliance

We carefully test and listen to all of
the low cost equipment to find the

sive great units

Not only is Opus One. Penn-
sylvania's oldest (founded in 1959)
stereo store. but our staff has worked
very hard to gain great knowledge
about sound. Our people have in-
stalled more stereo systems, repaired ‘
more components. and recorded
more live concerts than all other Pitts-
burgh audio stores put together!

Our $499 wstem has been
carefully engineered with a Sonus

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

The Pitt football team has fallen

9 on some hard times the last three

seasons, but one could never tell
from the amount of coverage the
Panthers receive on ESPN.

For the third consecutive year,

_ESPN will kick off its live tele-

vision coverage featuring Pitt in
a nationally televised game.
The Panthers will open the sea-

son on ESPN Wednesday night at
8 (EST) against Brigham Young in
Provo, Utah.

The game was originally sched-
uled for Saturday, Sept. 5, but
was moved to accomodate ESPN.

This will be the fourth consecu-
tive year the Panthers have
opened their season with a

nationally televised game on

ESPN. ..
Pitt opened the 1983 season on
ESPN against Brigham Young at

Pitt Stadium, losing 20-14.

In 1985 the Panthers played
their first night game ever at Pitt
Stadium and defeated Purdue,
3'1-30.

Last season Pitt once again
opened the season on ESPN on
Labor Day, losing to Maryland
under the lights at Pitt Stadium,
10-7.

The Panthers other appearance A

on ESPN was in 1985 against
Penn State. Pitt lost tothe Nittany

 

 

' Fans will be able to enjoy nighttime games permanently from now on because of the sched-

uled installation of lights at Pitt Stadium. This photo shows a previous game illuminated by

temporary lighting.

  

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 31, l987

Lions at Pitt Stadium, 31-0.

Incidentally, the increasing
number of appearances Pitt has
made on ESPN is one of the rea-
sons the school is currently
installing permanent lights in Pitt
Stadium.

This week's game against
Brigham Young will mark the first
time Pitt hasiplayed an away
game on ESPN.

Despite the fact the Panthers
have a combined record of
13—17—3 the last three seasons,
Mike Soltys, ESPN’s coordinator
of programming information, said
that Pitt is still an attractive team
for ESPN telecasts.

”There’s a good deal of interest
with Pitt. Pitt, Penn State and
Boston College are the.teams in
the Northeast [part of the coun-
try] that people relate to, and so
much of the population lives in
the northeastern quarter of the
country,” Soltys said.

”Tradition comes into play.
People know that Pitt has had
strong teams in the past, and
Brigham Young has always been
an attraction because they pass
quite a bi-t. This game will be a
nice intersectional matchup,” he
added.

The television ratings are also
a major reason for ESPN’s‘deci—
sion to open the season with a
game involving the Panthers.

In 1984, the Pitt—Brigham
Young matchup received a rating
of 4.4, which was the highest
rated weekend telecast in the
five-year Nielsen rating history of

Double dose of luck: Lights and ESPN

ESPN." _ .

In the rating system, each point
is equal to the number of homes
receiving ESPN, which currently
reaches 42.8 million homes;

The Pitt—Purdue game in 1985
had a 3.4 rating, which was
below the season average, but
the. Panthers game against
Maryland last year had a 4.8 rat-
ing —- the highest of the season.
The 1985 Pitt-Penn‘ State game
had a 5.5 rating, which was the
second highest rating of the year.

Due to Pitt's presence in
ESPN’s college football coverage,
the university has, in the past,
employed the services of a light-
ing company, MUSCO, to install
temporary lights for the night

T games at Pitt Stadium.

Earlier this summer,‘though,
Pitt President Dr. Wesley Posvar
approved a decision to install per-
manent lights at the stadium.

”We are installing permanent
lights at Pitt Stadium for a num-
ber of reasons. First, and most
substantially, we plan to increase

our home attendance, based on-

a marketing survey of season tick-
et holders, students and individu-
al ticket purchasers completed
two years ago who indicated they
would like to see night games at
Pitt Stadium,” said Athletic Direc-
tor Dr. Edward Bozik. .

Bozik said that 85.2 percent of
those who were surveyed called
for more night games.

Another reason Bozik cited is

the fact that, in the long run, hav-
ing permanent lights will be
financially feasible and more
convenient as opposed to using
portable lights when ESPN wants
to televise a Pitt home game.
' Added Bozik, ”The engineer-
ing difficulties have been over-
come, and advanced technology
in the cameras and lights them-
selves have made it more eco-
nomical to begin constructioniat
this time.”

The cost of the lights is report- i

edlyaround $750,000 and will
be paid in ‘approximately 10
years by the revenues from

increased ticket sales and the‘

money that will be saved on ren-
tals for portable lights.

Jones-Krall Inc. is installing the
lights, which will be placed on
six poles. Lights will be installed
on the upper side of the stadium
behind sections 14-15, 17-18,
19-20 and 22. Lights on the lower
side will be placed behind sec-
tions 4-5 and 33.

Pitt has scheduled three of its
seven home games this year for
night play. The Sept. 19 game
against Temple and the Oct. 3
game against Boston College are
scheduled for 7 p.m., and the
Nov. 14 matchup with Penn State
has a starting time of 7:30 p.m.

Soltys said that the Pitt-Penn
State game has a good chance of
being televised on ESPN because
the station has an open spot for
a game on that date, although he
added that nothing definite has
been determined.

_THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 3l, I987’

The quarterback query maybe answered

By Christopher Sepesy
Sports Editor

Remember all the hoopla last
season when the Pitt Panthers
were suddenly stranded without
a quarterback?

_Wel|, maybe they're stuck in a
time warp or something because,
going into this season, Pitt head
coach Mike Gottfried has yet to
choose one sole passer to man
his offensive squads.

But, Gottfried maintains there
is hope.

”We’ve got three very good
people to fill in where John [Con-

gemi] left,” he said. ”And at least
two of them have some exper-
ience — not much, but some."

The most logical and albeit
obvious frontrunner in this race
is Sal Genilla. ”Sal leads the
parade just about the same as
John Congemi did last year,” said
Gottfried.

”SaI, just for the fact that he's
been here, I would say probably
has the best chance, but don't
rule out the others,”.added offen-
sive coordinator and quarterback
coach Mike Dickens. ”They all
have a preety good feel for the
ball.”

-. . ... ,

But there are some possible
drawbacks in Genilla’s situation.

Genilla was selected by Gott-
fried last season to fill in as starter
for the injured John Congemi in
the Nov. 8 game against the then
rated No. I Miami Hurricanes.
The Panthers lost that game,
37-10.

It is not because of the loss
itself that Gottfried holds pause
about Genilla but because of the
fact he was thrust into the situa-
tion-so suddenly and has not had

the best amount of grooming

needed for a starting passer. '
”|t all falls into the same trap

we were in last year,” comment-
ed Gottfried. ’’I tend to call it a
senior curse. Instead of having a
sophomore or junior player, we
can work with over the years and
get them to fit our specifications,
we have seniors. One year, and
then bang, they're graduated.
Then we have to start all over
again with a clean slate.”
However, through actions
alone, Genilla plans to make his
coaches see the power he feels
he has acquired since that less-
than-promising November eve.
What can be expected of him
throughout the season?

”l’ve really worked hard all
spring and summer doing a lot of
lifting and running, and I've also
done a lot with my own attitude,”
said Genilla. ’’I’m not a very
vocal guy, and that may have
been part of my problem last
year. I was never a real take-
charge guy. Instead, I would just
sit back and watch John do all the
calling and, eventually, I got lost
in the shuffle —— even when I
eventually had to start. But now
I'm ready.to do anything. .

determined to get it. The only

Sports Editor

Returning senior quarterback
Joe Felitsky‘, a player some

thought would be a strong con-

tender for the starting position,
will not be playing for the Pan-
thers this year because of medi-
cal complications.

”We can't give you any specif-
ic reason except that his doctors
keep telling us it's medical rea-
sons and medical reasons alone,”
said Pitt head coach Mike

Gottfried could not give the ac-
tual ”medical reasons” com-
plicating Felitsky’s career at the
moment. ,

Gottfried went on to say that he
personally as well as the entire
Panther team will feel the loss of
Felitsky. '

”Joe was a very good football
player and we saw a lot of
promise in him last year.‘ It's a

real shame this had to happen at _

this time, and we'll miss him.

we have, and we still do have

it doesn't happen, we still all will

want to go to a Jan. I bowl
game.”

Genilla seems far from ‘being a
self-defeatist, however, if the case
does arise, there are the afore-
mentioned two other players
eager and ready to take his spot.

Very ready.

”I want the starting position
very badly,” said sophomore
returner Larry Wanke, who saw
little playing time last season. ”So
badly I can almost taste it. But
what I want to do the most all
season, and I think I can talk for
the rest of the team as well as

myself, is just to win games. We
all want to win. .

Gottfried said Wanke has
shown a lot of promise to him all
year. But there is still that lack of
sorely‘ needed experience that
Wanke must overcome.

”Basically, what we're looking
for in Larry is to see whether or
not he has improved since last
season,” said Gottfried. ”This
will be our key as to both where
and when we will play him. But
I know he has been working
almost all summer and that alone
should make up for a difference
that might have been there.

It is true Wanke has been work-
ing on his passing game all sum-
mer. At one point, he said, he
even called many of his old

   

I n-#1

receiver friends from his high ,'

school team to just go out and
run plays with him. _> _
But as far as strategizin-g the

I deal, Wanke said helhas no inten-

tions of doing so.

”I don't really have any set, I

strategy as to getting the starting
position. I just want to be able to
go and show the coaches that I've
grown up from being a freshman
right off the street and can han-
dle the job. And I really think I
can.”

Yet there is still one more
prime candidate — freshman
recruit Darnell Dickerson -‘who
cannot, under any circumstance,
be ruled out of the running.

’’I’m ready to be the best stu-

I dent of the game that I can be,”

said Dickerson. ”I’m Iearning_the
systems and, so far, I'm coming
along fine.

’’I really doubt I'll be the start-
er,” he added, ”but I do expect V
to play.” ‘

Gottfried agrees.

”Darnell shows me a lot of
promise in a quarterback. I can't
say how glad I am we recruited
him, and he should see playing
time this’ season.”

And so it goes. There are two
other members of the team
behind these three — freshman
recruit Dean El-Attrache and
sophomore walk—on Kiernan.
Scanlon — but their chances are
virtually nill.

”We’re back to square one
again this year,” added Gottfried.
”The ideal situation is to be able
to groom someone from the start
all the way up. If you get two
years out a quarterback anymore,
you're lucky. .

”But at least we're back
track.”

Heyward gets the hand-off and
plows through the defensive line
for a first down.

Danny Boyd, top junior college
player Andre Southerland from
Butler Community College, along
with Bill Fegley, Nate Heyward
and Zeke Gadson, and the Pan-
thers are overflowing with run-
ning backs. _

But it's not going to be that
way. '

Subtract Gladman, Boyd,
Southerland and Gadson.

with a lot of decisions to make.

”Anytime you lose a player, it
hurts you but again, fortunately,
we recruited a lot of running
backs,” Gottfried said.

Tailback Charles Gladman,
Pitt's fourth leading rusher of all
time, could have led the offense
this season. But his absence
might inspire Craig Heyward to
become a star in his own right.

Listed among the nation's top
five backs in The Sporting News
after gaining 756 yards last sea-
son, Heyward may have to carry
an offense also smarting from the
loss of quarterback John
Congemi.

”The pressure isn't mostly on
my back,” Heyward said. ”Just
because I had a semi-good year
last year, we're still going to pass
a lot.” ‘

Heyward may have had a
”semi-good" year statistically,
but if he runs each week the way
he did against Miami and Tem-
ple, Pitt won't have to worry
about passing the ball. In those
two games combined, Heyward
accumulated 425 yards rushing.

When the Panthers choose to
run, Heyward will be there. In
fact, two Heywards might be
there. Senior Nate Heyward is
listed as the top candidate to join
his brother in the backfield. Nate
saw limited‘ action last year at full-
back and enters this season
slightly ahead of sophomore Bill
Fegley on the depth charts.

But starting is a prospect Nate
doesn't want to think about at the
moment. .

”That.hasn’t really hit my mind
yet,” he said. ’’I don't think like
that. If I make it, then I make it.
I don't know if I will, but if I do,
they'll get a 100 percent.”

Natemight start at fullback,

while his brother. Craig plays tail--

back. Yes, that’s right. Even
though'260—pound Craig may
seem like a more natural fullback,

. Nate (6-foot-I, 185 pounds) will

probably be the starter.
But Gottfried said his position

_isn’t secure.

”Nate’s going to have to earn
that position, because we antici-
pated Craig and Charles Glad-
man doing the bulk of the work,”
Gottfried Said. .

Craig said he's looking forward
to the chance of playing in the
same backfield as his brother.

”I’m real happy for him
[Nate],” Craig said. ”He’s been
switching back and forth on a lot

of different positons, and I'm glad "

he's going to get a chance to
play.”
Fegley will challenge Nate

Heyward at fullback. Like Hey- .

ward, Feg|ey's small for the posi-
tion (5-foot-8, 185 pounds), but
the second-year walk-on figures
to give it a run for the money.

Sophomore Adam Walker
(6-foot-3, 183 pounds) will also
back up Craig Heyward at
tailback.

”He’s a legitimate possibility to
help us,” Gottfried said of Walk-
er, who sat out last year after
being declared ineligible because
of Proposition 48.

”Craig’s not going to play the
whole game anyway,” he con-
tinued. ”And you might want to
switch him in a tvvo-back set, so
Adam could “take Gladman’s

QB Dickersonprefers the pigskin over all

‘By john Enright

Editor in Chief

Demetreus Gore, a forward/
guard on the Pitt basketball team,
has a job to do for the Panthers.

His main responsibilities —
score points, play ”D” and try to
excite the crowd with an occa-
sional slam dunk.

But this past winter, Gore took
on" a new task away from the
basketball floor. He became a
recruiter for Mike Gottfried’s foot-
ball team. '

Gore helped Pitt recruit Darnell
Dickerson, a quarterback from
Detroit, Mich. ' ll

Gore knows Dickerson from
his high schools days when the
two played in the Detroit Public
League. At the time, Gore was a
senior at Chadsey High School
and was one of the top basketball

' prospects in the country, while

Dickerson was a freshman on the
Martin Luther King High School
team.

"I remember playing against
Demetreus. We had some good
match-ups,” said Dickerson, who
is hoping to battle senior Sal

Genilla for the starting quarter- '

back position on the 1987 edition
of the Pitt football team.

”Demetreus helped us in
recruiting Darnell,” said ~ Gott-
fried. ”When Darnell came here
for a visit, ‘Demetreus came right
out and helped him.”

”Demetreus called me a few
times, gave me some advice and
told me what Pitt was like,” said
Dickerson.

With the success Dickerson
enjoyed on the basketball court
at Martin Luther King High
School, it's a wonder why Gore
didn't try to persuade him to play

.- for Paul Evans’ Panthers.

’’I truly believe [Darnell] could
walk on the floor at a Division I
basketball program and probably
start. And when I say probably
start, there would have to be a
need for him to start, but he'd
play,” said Gottfried.

Dickerson earned four letters in
basketball and averaged 26.3
points per game his senior year.

Dickerson said he was.recruit-
ed for basketball by all the Big
Ten schools and Missouri and
Syracuse, but he wanted to play
football all along.

Playing college basketball
wasn’t the only temptation stand-
ing between Dickerson and the
football field, though.

He's also a talented baseball
player and was drafted by the
Kansas City Royals in the 23rd
round of the major league draft
in June.

Dickerson decided, not to sign
with the Royals.

’’I had talked to people who i

were giving me advice to go to
school and get my education
because I'm going to play base-

V ball here and [the scouts] will

definitely be coming around
looking at me,” said Dickerson.

’’I’m just going to concentrate
on [football] for now and try to
play baseball [also].”

Gottfried said that there would
be no conflict if Dickerson wants
to play baseball at Pitt. ”We’ll get

‘ Darnell enough in spring ball that

he'll get a chance to work with
us. He told us-he wanted to play
baseball, and we told him he'd
have the opportunity to do both.”

Dickerson-'5' basketball and
baseballexploits are impressive,

. .b.Ut f9°tba!.'..i§ thespon  

he was most heavily recruited.

Last year, Dickerson complet-
ed 95 passes in 161 attempts for
1,609 yards and 19 touchdowns
for Martin Luther King, which
finished second in the city.

Dickerson, who was the Michi-
gan Player of the Year, passed for
5,500 career yards and 56
touchdowns.

Max Emfinger, who runs a foot-
ball scouting service, called Dick-
erson the best all—around athlete
in the country among all incom-
ing freshmen.

Talented athletes can usually
find various positions to play on
a football team. But, even if Dick-
erson can’t beat out Genilla for
the starting position, he won't be
moved to another position.

”Darnell will be a quarterback
and stay at quarterback the whole
way. He is a good athlete, but he
will be a great quarterback here
someday,” said Gottfried.

Going into fall camp at Johns-
town, Dickerson was No. 3 on
the depth chart behind Genilla

and redshirt freshman Larry
Wanke.

While backing up Genilla is a
realistic and conservative goal,
Dickerson-thinks he could take
the top spot. ‘ ‘ 

Said Dickerson, ”To imagine.’ ’

being the starting quarterback,
well, it's a little pressure on me.
I'll compare myself with the other
quarterbacks and get myself
ready.  I think I'll be ready to
take the job — at least it's pos-
sible. If not, I'm working to be the
No. 2 quarterback.”

Added Gottfried, ”Darnell,
depending on how quick he

learns what he's doing, could

challenge [for the starting posi-
tion]. I would not rule out a fight
for No. 1 before it's all over. It
depends on how [Darnell’s] men-
tal make—up is and if he’s ready.

-”He has the best arm of the
quarterbacks. His arm is very
strong. He snaps his wrist almost
like a whip. He's just avery gifted
athlete.”

is in sore need of another player
to fill Gladman’s spot. But he

" maintains that although this

position is hurt, it is not lamed.

Gottfried said he probably
plans on using returner but inex-
perienced Adam Walker.
”Craig’s not going to play the
whole game anyway, so we

might want to switch him in a"

two back set, so Adam could take
Gladman’s spot,” he said. Other
possibilities include three fresh-
man recruits — David Coleman,
Ronald Redmon and Steve Gahr
— but they seem highly unlikely.

At fullback, there is almost no
question whatsoever that the
starter will be senior Nate Hey-

   

ward. Also, small statured but
high—powered sophomore Bill
Fegley could be counted as a
strong back—up. Other possibili-
ties include recruits Jeff Christy,
Prentiss Wright and Eric
Holzworthf‘

Sophomore Tom Huebner
should finally be able to see his
day in the sun this season at tight
end, a position he has worked at
for over a year. Also a contender
is senior David Shuck, who is
coming off injuries that forced
him to sit out the entire l986sea-
son. Others are junior Vernon
Kirk and David Tanczos,
however, they are dark horses.

But freshman recruit Eric Sea-
man is another good possibility to

fit in behind Huebner. ”Eric is
one strong kid who will fit in well
at this position,” said Gottfried,
”and I definitely think we'll be
using him this season.”

Kicker holds no problem what-
soever. Jeff Van Horne, Pitt's
leading scorer last season as a
freshman, retumshas does punter
John Rasp, who also "had an
amazing freshman year. Back—ups
are senior Mark Brasco and
sophomore Erik Mathieson.

But again this year, the quarter-
back slot may be turning into
another headache. Gottfried has
three good but unseasoned pass-
ers from which he has to choose
— Sal Genilla, Larry Wanke and
Darnell Dickerson. As yet, he

hasn't chosen.

And now, to the defense.

”We have a good defense, but
we've really got to watch out for
injuries,” said Gottfried. ’’If we
get a lot of people hurt, we could
really be in some trouble."

Most of Gottfried’s defenders,
however, seem to know their
ways well enough to be able to
avoid injury — at least for the
time being. 1 '  ..

The position at which the Pan-
thers have the most experience is
linebacker. And the standout
player here is Jerry ”Caveman"
Olsavsky. He led Pitt last year
with 127 tackles, averaging over
ll per game. Also, seasoned
veterans Darrel Woods, Ezekial
Gadson and Jerry Wall will be
able to handle the positions well.
Senior Matt Lavigna may also be
able to fill in here if the need
arises.

At tackle, junior returning let-

should again make quite an
impact. Even though he hadiai
few injury problems since last,
season, he is expected to stay

-_ healthy throughout this one. The

other position is supposedly wide

Spindler should show why he is top recruit .

By Beth Froelich

Assistant Sports Editor

The road for a freshman foot-
ball recruit at a school with a fine
football tradition such as Pitt is a
rough one — even for a top fresh-
man recruit like Marc Spindler.

A recruit enters an unfamiliar
program and must prove he looks
as good on the field as his high
school statistics looked pre-
season on paper. '

His teammates may have a lot
of experience, a lot more than he
does. Some are the best players
in the country.

But always, a freshman recruit
will hold fast to the dream that he
will play a starting position in his
freshman year.

Freshman recruit Marc Spindler
has traveled this rocky road and
has proven his natural abilities at
camp. He will be starting this
year as a defensive tackle for the
Panthers.

Spindler, one of the most high-
ly sought-after players in the
country, looked exceptionally

season.

He was the USA Today Defen-
sive Player of the Year, an As-
sociated Press All-America, a
Parade Al|—American, an Addidas
All American, a Bally All Ameri-
can. He was named Don Hein-
rich’s College Top Newcomer of
the Year.

Spindler was All-State, All-
Conference, All-Region Defen-
sive Lineman of the Year while
under coach Joe DeAntona at
West Scranton High School.

He was also selected as a mem-
ber of the Big 33 team and was
named in Emfinger’s Top 100.

Spind|er’s high-schoo_l playing
statistics are equally impressive.

He was a four-year starter,
played 46 straight games, made
62 solo tackles and 52 assisted
tackles — 18 were for a loss. He
recovered four fumbles and
blocked two punts.

Pitt head football coach Mike
Gottfried expects a lot out of this
impressive recruit this season.

”He’s a really tough kid and a

gut player,” said Gottfried. "I ex— ,

to play.

’’I hope what he did in camp
will sustain throughout the sea-
son," continued Gottfried. "He
really kicked in during those first
practices."

Spindler, who chose Pitt over
Penn State, Notre Dame, Iowa
and Syracuse, is not sure what to
expect from college ball this year.

"’| just want to have a good first
year,” said Spindler. ”Of course,
I would like to start, but whatever
the coach has in mind for me I'll
do.

”I can't say right now what I
want to do with or for this foot-
ball team —'— except help it win,”
continued Spindler. ”I can only
give what I have, and that's really
nothing compared to college ball.
I really think this year will give
me a good taste of what to expect
when it comes down to playing
college ball.” 9

As things stand now, it looks
like Spindler will start alongside
junior Tony Siragusa on the
defensive line and be backed up
by seniors Charles Swink and
Chuck Williams.

"I think I'll fit in well with the
defensive line,” said Spindler.
"I've already made some good
friends like Goose [Tony Siragu-
sa]. I just want to be able to learn
from them all what they already
know about football.”

Spindler does notfeel as at ease
with tackling the academic part
of school as he does with tackling
the opposing team's offensive
players.

"It makes me nervous just
being here,” said Spindler. ’’I
don't really know what college is
like. I just got my schedule down
the other day. But, I specifically
came to Pitt because I thought it
would give me a good education.
It's a good background to have in
case I'll ever have to go out and
get a job."

Award as the most valuable
defensive lineman during the
spring; and Carnel Smith has
been called by Gottfried his
”most improved player." No
problem here.

The secondary should be able
to hold its own this season. Cor-
nerbacks Gary Richard, Michael
Hadley and Quintin Jones are
each seasoned, as are strong
safety Billy Owens and free safety
Troy Washington. Look for
sophomore Doug Hetzler to pos-
sibly be behind Owens, and
either Marcus Washington (no
relation), transfer Dan Crossman
or freshman Louis Riddick to
back up Washington.

For the special teams, as stated
above, Van Horne and Rasp will
do the kicking honors. Billy
Osborn is the experienced leader
on punt returns, with Alonzo
Hampton backing him up.
Michael Hadley looks to be first
among kickoff returners.

"We have some good, hard
working kids this year," said
Gottfried. ”They are dedicated
and ready to win. '

”And that's exactly what we
plan to do. Win games."

Gottfried has always been a
man of his word —— with the talent
he has to work with, he shouldn't

have too many problems.   .

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 31, 1987

Some fond remembrances of things past

Have you seen Animal House?

Do you remember Flounder,
the fat guy who didn't have a clue
what life was about? When I left
college in 1979, I had an attitude
something like Flounder’s.

”Isn’t this grrrrrreat?” I thought,
wandering out into the real
world.

I didn't have to go to class
anymore.

I didn't have to read things I
cared nothing about anymore.

I didn't have to memorize
things for tests anymore.

I didn't have to sit in the din-
ing hall while they were putting
up chairs on the tables around
me, cleaning the floors while I
chugged my eighth cup of black
coffee so I could stay up until
5:15 a.m. reading things I cared
nothing about or memorizing
things for tests.

You know, I miss it.

I miss it a lot.

I'm 30 now. My name is Peter .

King. I live in Bloomfield, N.J.,
and I cover the New York Giants
and pro football for Newsday, a
newspaper in New York.

I have also written for The
Sporting News and Inside Sports,
and I'm now writing a book
about dynasties in sports.

I'm, married to a woman named
Ann from Pittsburgh. I met her 10
years ago, you guessed it, at col-
lege — Ohio University. What a
great woman she is, having given
up her writ_ing career for the time
being to raise our two girls, Laura
and Mary Beth.

I go on some nice trips because
of my job. I get to stay in hotels

with phones in the bathrooms.
Life's been good to me so far.
No, great.

My wife thinks I'm an idiot for
saying this,.but sometimes I long
for the thrilling days of yesteryear
— the days you're about to get
into now.

The only Saturday afternoons I
remember from college are the
sunny and pretty ones. Studying?
Yeah, there was some of that, but
I don't remember any drudgery,
so there couldn't have been any.

Part of this fondness, I think, is
because you always tend to think
things are going to be better
somewhere else or because you
think that other times in your life
were such golden fun.

There's a football player on the
Giants named Phil McConkey

who always wanted more playing

time; he was a receiver who
didn't catch many passes because

other, better players were in front
of him. The Giants released him
last year, and the pitiful Green
Bay Packers picked him up.

McConkey was buried there,
too. So when the Giants traded
for him a month later because of
injuries to some of their players,
the first thing he did when he
walked back into the Giant's
locker room was write these
words on the blackboard: ”The
grass is greener, my ass!”

Well, the grass was certainly
green in Athens, Ohio. College
was fun because it was:

0 The first time a woman took
me to her room.

0 A way to prevent me from
working in a parking garage in
Hartford for the rest of my life.

0 The place I met my wife and
most of my current friends.

0 The best way to find out if
you're good enough to do some-
thing of consequence in the real
world. i

0 About the only place, unless
you want to do some kind of
trade, to get the experience to do
what you want to do for the rest
of your life. (Had to sneak that
one in there.)

0 The place I saw Springsteen
— fourth row, stage left, 12 feet
from Clarence -— with 1,700
other people who had no idea
what we were really seeing.

0 Where I learned that spaghet-
ti, a gallon of wine and a grain-
alcohol after-dinner cordial don't
mix and where-, on the same
night, I learned that sleeping face
down in a snowbank is not a
good idea.

l - Craig Heyward — tosome the

name instills the epitomy of what
Pitt football should be, and, to
others, the name brings reminis-
cences of fear.

, Who is Craig Heyward? What
is this myth named lronhead who
prsents himself as sometime
philanthropist and sometime
brute?  ,

' Mike Gottfried, Pitt’s'head foot-
ball coach, has called him one of
the best players he has ever
worked ’ with. Last year, the
defense of the then rated No. 1
team in the country, the Miami
Hurricanes, said he was nothing
less than trying to stop a
locomotive.

‘A great football_player he is,
but there is another side -— one
which is not easy to read through
the hype in which he has been

‘enveloped and one that he does
not openly present to those he
doesn't know.

On August 7, I987, Craig Hey-
ward sat down with The Pitt
News to discuss just who and
,what he is, be it athlete, student
or plain person.

Q: You're regarded as being
possibly the best football player
Pitt has. You're breaking records,
as well as other teams’ lines. You
may be a Heisman Trophy can-
didate. How was it you prepared
for this and, in turn, what is your
reaction?

A: As a running back in high

_ ' school, we all had some type of
is individual goal we set for our-
_ selves. One of my main goals was

to out—do any of the other running
backs and previous ones. When
I got to college, it changed to
breaking records. But, when I got
here as a freshman, the competi-

I tion was phenominal because we

had several rurlning backs like
A.B. Brown, Charles Gladman,
Ezekial Gadson, myself, Chuckie
Scales, Darnell Stone. What we
had was reallyjust a herd of run-
ning backs, and the competition
was great.

This is good, though, because
it keeps you in line and makes
you perform at your peak
because you know someone is
always behind you. And, if you're
ready to fall behind, your job is
on the line — the next person

A behind you will go up. So that's

what made me even work harder
in being the best I can and, of
course, I really love the game of
football.

I'll do whatever is required of
me to win the game, but I can't
do it all myself because the game
consists of 11 people. But by all
of us excelling a lot, then the
good of it all goes to everyone,
and then we all know what we
have received.

Q: But what about the Heis-
man Trophy?

A: As far as the Heisman goes,
winning it has never been one of
my highest goals —-— being ranked
is satisfying enough. But you
can't be satisfied unless you're
happy and, if there is any truth in
what people like Coach Gottfried
and others are saying that there

. are great possibilities about Craig

Heyward possibly winning the
Heisman one day, then I can't
think of anything else that would

- make me [happier]. But it never

was really something that was top
on my ‘mind.

Q: Is it now?
A: Yeah. Well, I mean, know-

. ing now that there are opportu-

nities that you can perform to the
best of your abilities and being
recognized. Like in the Miami
game. Before that game, I was
just known as a good bulldozing
running back. But when I did it
against the No. 1 team in the
country and ran all over them, [it]

just like the incident
with the paperboy. I
went to court with him.
That wasn't the kid that
kicked me in the shin,
and I put over the car.
So I'm totally upset
about it but, you know,
life goes on... Going to
court over that was like

totally stupid.

H Sports Editor

Q: What were some of your
favorite pastimes?

A: Well, me and my brother,
we used to go to Boys’ Club a lot.
That was like the big happening
back then. We'd play pool, flag
football -— that was the biggest
competition there —- basketball
and stuff like that.

But there were like things that
we didn't have that we wanted,

really gave me a name, and peo-
ple really look up to that and lit-
tle kids say wow.

Q: Did you think that people
wouldn't be able to see the
power you have in you?

A: Well, they look at me and
think that because of my size,
268, that I wouldn't be able to do
that. But I prove them wrong.

I'm the new breed.

Q: Was that your biggest or,
let's say, your favorite game?

A: Well, playing Miami and
being on national television — I
was so psyched! And the coach
kept saying, "This is the No. 1
team, and we're on national tele-
vision. Anybody has the chance
to rise to the top. It's either now
or never.” And all that week dur-
ing practice, I just kept emphasiz-
ing that I just had to run into the
end zone, just keep running into
that end zone, no matter where
I'm at on the field, just straight
into the end zone.

The way~you practice is the
way you're [going to] play and,
if you play with an open mind,
tough and hard and enthused,
then things are liable to happen.
And during that game, we played
smart so that our offensive line
could take advantage of some of
their people. We used some of
the easiest strategies around —
just run it right up the middle. But
a lot of the time we outsmarted
them, so we could just run right
up the middle.

Q: You mentioned about little
kids looking at you play and say-
ing wow. Is this something that
means a lot to you?

A: Oh yeah. I don't know of
anyone who wouldn't feel good
if a little kid thought of [him] as
something or someone who was
good.

Q: How about your childhood?

A: Well, I grew up in Passaic,
N.J. I was born in Beth Israel
Hospital. I can't recall how much
I weighed!

Q: Were you always a big kid?

A: No. When I was a little kid,
I wasn't as big. Well, I was always
big for my age, but I really didn't
start growing until I was about 6.
But by the time I was about 8,
people would look at me and not
be able to believe I was 8.

so we would go about taking
them or getting them or, well,
stealing them — we would even-
tuaily go about getting them
somehow. And, somehow, we

“ got it. So, as a child, I was

involved with the law a lot.

4 But, for a while, it was just like
kicks. It was like peer pressure.
But we had a good time doing it
until things just got out of hand.

Q: Did you always live in .

Passaic? -
A: Yes, but we moved around
the city a lot. When we moved

uptown from downtown, that's

when Nate got involved in little
league‘ football —— I always
thought to myself, "Well, why
can't I get involved in the little
league?" But I was always over-

weight, so I only played in one

game; and I was so big, I remem-
ber [that] I ran one play, and it
took almost their entire team to
tackle me — they still couldn't get
me down.

The reason why the play was
stopped was because I was out of
bounds and they were still trying
to tackle me.

Q: Was that your first interest
in football?

A: Well, I went through
elementary school and junior
high and took classes, and one
day the coach looked at me and
said, "Well, good size.”

They had this superstar game
for upcoming freshmen into high
school. Well, me, Nate and
Stevie [Craig's younger
brother]went to it. I won first
place, Nate won second, and
Stevie won third place. The
events were the 40-yard dash,
weight lifting, lateral run, pull-ups
and the vertical jump.

That was when the coach really
noticed me. He told me he want-
ed me to come out for the team.
So I went to camp at Farleigh-
Dickerson.

I started as a freshman at full-
back, but all I basically did was
block. As a sophomore, I was a
fullback again, but that was when
I gained my first 1,000 yards. My
junior year and senior year, I was
a tailback. We won the state
championship two years and, in
my senior year, we went 11-0.

But for it all, we had a pretty
good time, and it gave us

memories we'll never forget.

Q: If you could go back, are
there things you would possibly
change if you could about grow-
ing up the way you did?

A: The thing I probably would
like to change is all the theft that
I probably did. And, there were
probably ways that I could have
avoided a lot of fights and stuff
like that. .

Now, after experience, I realize
it was more like a matter of pride,
with people saying things if you
backed down’ like, "Oh, you're a
punk, you're a punk. Sissy, sissy.”
Those are all situations to pro-
voke you into fighting.

But now, I'm being in situa-
tions where it's easily avoidable,
where I know I don't have to fight
them because Iknow my capabil-
ities and know what I can do to
them.

Q: Do you find a lot of that
happening now? Do people want
to pick fights with you?

A: Yeah. Well, then again, no.
Athletes, no matter what sport
they're in, football, basketball,
etc., they'll run into people
who'll look at them and say
things like, "Hey, you're no
different than me because you
play football, basketball or
whatever," and, eventually, what
they're trying to say is just that
because you participate in a sport
you think you're better and [that]
you think you should have every-
thing handed out to you. People

just tend to question you and,

finally, it comes out as, "Go

I ahead, hit me! Hit me, and then

see where you'll be at tommor-
row." So playing a sport can real-
ly sometimes be a disadvantage
to you.

People will just come up to you
and just hit you. Now, knowing

the area where I'm from, I'll take I

that as an insult and accept you're
challenge. To me, it's like a
challenge. It's giving me an invi-
tation and, if I back down from

that invitation, I'm like a coward. -

But as you get older, you real-
ize that fighting isn't the best
solution. Now, sometimes it can
be the athlete's fault, maybe after

I a couple of beers or something.

But then again, he's also probably
out having a good time, and here
comes somebody to spoil it all.
So sometimes, it can't be con-
trolled. And if they put their
hands on you, and you react —

you're still in the wrong. So if-

you're an athlete, there's almost
no way you can win.

Q: Does this aspect of it all
anger you?

A: I consider myself an angry
person over this because if you're
involved in an altercation, an
argument or whatever, and it gets
in the paper, there's no way you
can clear yourself unless you go
to an editor and he has concrete
evidence that it was false infor-
mation. That's the only way
you're going to clear yourself.

just like the incident with the
paperboy. I went to court with
him. That wasn't the kid that
kicked me in the shin, and I put
over the car. So I'm totally upset
about it but, you know, life goes
on.

When we were in court, the
judge asked him, "Did you curse
at him?" You could tell that he
had been rehearsing his whole

routine, and he was like, "Oh no,,

I never curse." You know damn
well that when he's away from

CHARLES SMITH

By lohn Enright
Editor in Chief

Coming out of Bridgeport,
Conn., as a high school All-
American in 1984, Charles Smith
was pursued by practically every
basketball power in the country.

But the 6-foot-10 forwardl _

center decided on Pitt, a rather
peculiar choice considering the
Panthers relatively unsuccessful
presence in the Big East Confer-
ence their first two years.

Smith intended to change all
that and, in some ways, he has.

He has been at Pitt for three
years now and has been the main
force in taking the Panthers from
the lower echelon of the Big East
to their present status as one of
the best basketball teams in the
country.

Individually, Smith's accumu-
lated some rather impressive
honors -— such as Big East Fresh-
man of the Year in 1985, first
team All-Big East in 1987 and
honorable mention All-American
for three straight years .— and he

should continue to receive such

accolades this upcoming season.

In short, he has been oneof the
most visible athletes on the Pitt
campus the last three years.

Even though, Smith isn't
without his critics, many of
whom claim his game is over-
rated alnd inconsistent and his
personality all too insolent and
pompous.

Smith doesn't see it that way,
though. He feels he's misun-
derstood.

On July 28, Smith sat down
and talked with The Pitt News,
explaining what it's like to be in
the spotlight at the age of 22.

Q: What was the biggest rea-
son for your decision to stay at
Pitt for your senior year and pass
up the NBA draft?

A: There was no major reason.
There were reasons that go either
way, so there was no major fac-
tor that made me stay.

Q: Could you talk about some ‘

of the reasons why you decided
to stay?

A: Well, if I finish up some of
these G [incomplete] grades that
I have right now, I'll have at the
most 27 credits to graduate start-
ing in the fall. And that looked
promising.

Plus the chance to go to the
Final Four and win it this year
with the team that we have.
Another year [playing] in college
isn't going to hurt me. I can only
‘get better. There's a few more
minor reasons, but I just decided
to stay.

Q: What's it like to have so
much attention focused on you?
Are you used to it?

A: Well, I'm used to it. It wasn't
like I thought of [my decision] as
the big sports event of the day. I
didn't think of it that way. It was
something I was doing. Other
people were concerned and
wanted to find out what I was

- doing, so it was a decision I was

making, that's all.

Q: Do people ever approach
you and assume that because
you're Charles Smith, basketball
star, you take drugs? '

A: Drugs are there, and it's all
up to the individual. As far as I'm
concerned withrthe [drug] tests
and that stuff, I could care less.

- If they do it [test], they do it; if
  . Ihev dcnft they d9n’t-- . .. .

.._;..
3!?‘

Q: Do you have to watch who
you hang out with because of
drugs?

A: I watch who I hang out with,
regardless. I don't hang outwith
a lot of people. I more or less
keep to myself. I watch who I
hang out with anyway — drugsor
no drugs — I'm that type of per-
son. I just don't hang out with
everybody. I'm by myself the
majority of the time.

Q: Have you always been that
way?

A: Yeah, I've been like that
even in high school. I may have
one, two or three friends I'll hang
out with the majority of the time,
but I'm not in a crowd. I'm not
caught in a crowd a lot.

Q: Why do you keep to your- .

self so much?

A: The majority of the time, if
I'm in a crowd people find things
to do. Trouble erupts and differ-
ent things start to happen, so I
keep to myself.

Q: How long have you been
living off-campus?

A: Since after my sophomore
yean -

Q: How do you feel about
being alienated from the campus
life?

A: When I come to campus, I
just go to class and socialize a lit-
tle bit with a few of my associ-
ates, but if I want to get away
from campus, I can just go home.

Q: Pitt makes a lot of money off
television revenue from athletic
events. Should student-athletes
be compensated?

A: That's a real touchy subject
right now. My thoughts don't
involve just Pitt, but all over [the
country]. I think the athletes
should get paid. A lot of people
don't realize that of the revenue
the NCAA brings in each year, 75
percent of it is from basketball. I
think 10 percent is from football,
and the rest is from the other
sports.

Last year the NCAA claimed

NCAA I mean.

Q: Are Division I athletes being
exploited?

A: Definitely, no doubt. No
doubt we're being used by the
system. If you talk to athletes
across the country, the majority
of them will say the same thing.
The NCAA brings in so much
money, and I'm not sure where
it goes — I wonder where it goes
sometime.

Q: Is the NCAA properly
addressing a lot of the problems
in big-time college athletics?

A: I think they cracked down a
lot as far as academics are con-
cerned, and I think that's good,
because’ in the past you had so
many people talking about the
student-athlete who couldn't read
or write. I think those days are
over with  I really think [that]
today all the athletes can do the
work.

Q: Are you in agreement with
Proposition 48?

A: To an extent. I can't really
say I agree with it; I'm 60-40
against it.

Q: How do you feel about
Proposition 48 in the case of Pitt
recruit Brian Shorter, who is
ineligible to play this year be-
cause he didn't score high
enough on the SAT?

A: I can't answer that because
I'm not in Brian's situation. In
general, like I said, I'm 60-40
against it mainly because  when
I look back at high school after
being at college, high school can
be more or less of a joke. You
have fun, you do the work, but
you're not really pushed. You’-re
enjoying it and having a good
time.

I think a lot of students go
through that, and they get to col-
lege and it's a different story.

The only reason [Brian's] case
has been publicized is because
he's Brian Shorter and he's in the
limelight. Other students don't
have to have a certain require-

‘ 

No doubt [student-
athletes] are being used
by the system. If you
talk to athletes across
the country, the majori-
ty of them will say the
same thing. The NCAA
brings in so much
money, and I'm not
sure where it goes. —- I
wonder where it goes
sometime.

— Charles Smith

$35 million, I think, from the
[basketball] ‘tournament. I under-
stand that at the Final Four, the
players’ parents were in the back
rows, and they had doctors, law-
yers and "all those guys sitting in
the front.

The NCAA is real messed up,
and they do a lot of things toward
the athletes. I think the athletes
are being used a lot. I definitely
think [athletes] should get paid.

. Do you think athletes
should get paid by how well they
perform?

A: No. I think everybody
should get a small sum, not a lot.
Only because they make so

much _Im.o.n.evJ each. year, the

ment to get in here but because
he's playing ball, he has to have
a certain requirement. It's
because he's an athlete.

Q: Has it been tough for you to
combine academics and basket-
ball at Pitt?

A:It’s tough, but the whole
thing is budgeting your time right
and using the tutors and the other
aides the school has for you to
help you graduate.

Q: So playing basketball at Pitt
is pretty much like a full-time job?

A: A lot of people don't realize
the schedules we have. Let's take
one day during the season. Let's
say, we play a road game on a

Wednesday. We'll go to class all 

 

day [on Tuesday]. We go to prac- . I’

tice at 4 until about 6 p.m., jump
on a bus and go to the airport 

when we get [to our destination],

we eat and go to bed.
The following morning, we
have practice, we eat lunch, we

have films, we rest and go to play ‘

the game at 8 o'clock. Then that
night, the game's over at 11 and

you're tired. You just want _to eat ’

and go to bed, and you have to

be back here by 9 o'clock the fol- - I

lowing morning to go to class.
And then people talk about

why don't they see Charles Smith «

in class or whatever. Once in a
while, I'm just too tired. I try to
get the notes off someone else,
and I'll just sleep in. The sched-
ules are tough, especially during-
the season. '

Q: Speaking of classes, do’.

professors cut you slack or treat
you the same as everyone else?

A: It differs. I've run across
professors who had something

against me when I stepped into '

the classroom. .
Q: Didn't that happen last sum-
mer when you were going to try-

out for the United States team for '

the World University Games?

A: Yeah, I'll never forget-zthat _’ "

experience with that professor. I
don't want to mention his name.
I wanted to go to the [tryouts],
and he more or less said, ‘If you
go, I don't think‘you're going to
pass this course.’

Talking to Coach [Paul] Evans,
he had stated that I'm good
enough that I could petition my
name and then be able to go to
the next [tryouts].  So I went

' back to the professor, and he said

‘OK, you can go, but you have
two speechs and a paper to do
before you leave’ — I had five

days to prepare two speeches and

a paper before I left.

I thought that was harsh. I
stayed up around the clock with
a tutor, and he helped me‘ out.
We completed it, and I ended up
leaving. So while I'm overseas, I

call back to the office to find out ‘V .

what my grade was and, after all
that trouble, and I thought my
work was sufficient, I ended up

getting a D. So things like that are 1

kind of messed up.

Q: Do you run into those A‘

problems a lot?

A: It differs. I run into some
professors who understand. I
have a few G [incomplete] grades
to make up, and they're all on me
at one time. I'm trying to get the
work in, and I'm frequently in
touch with [professors] —— they
more or less understand the situ-
ation and try to help me out by
giving me that little extra time. .

It's difficult. Some of the profes- I

sors are all right, and some aren't.
That [applies] for students, too, I
guess. . «
Q: When you have problems
with professors, does that bother
you, or do you accept the situa-
tion because of who you are?
A: I have no other reason than
to accept it. I think it's messed up
how some of the professors are
like that, but there's nothing I can
do about it. I just have to deal
with it.  I've had to go into

"some -classes, and I sense that

because I may sit there for two or
three classes and I don't say any-‘
thing-, the professor may have that

stereotype that I'm their typical .
athlete thatjust shows up to class. ‘ I

I sense that I had to participate

Secondary can boast of award—winners

By Tarun Reddy

Staff Writer

One of the bright spots for the
Pitt football team this season
should be the play of the defen-
sive secondary.

Several players have received
national recognition for their
efforts, and even the absence of
one of the key members of this
group doesn't seem to worry the
Panther coaching staff.

Senior Billy Owens, who is list-
ed as a Playboy All-American at
strong safety, should provide the
leadership necessary to make the
defensive backfield one of the
strong points of this year's team.

”Billy is unique in that he has

' great instinct in reacting to the

flow of the action,” said John
Fox, Pitt's secondary coach and
defensive coordinator.

Owens, a 6-foot-2 senior from
Syracuse, N.Y., intercepted four
passes last year for 106 yards,
returning two of those for
touchdowns.

Last season, Owens was
switched to safety as a part of an
overall restructuring of the
defense under head coach Mike
Gottfried.

”A year under [Owen's] belt
should make him even stronger,”
Gottfried said.

Owens is seen as the leader of
a secondary, which is expected to
improve on its performance from
last year. The defensive backfield
was ranked 48th in the country,
surrendering an average of 183.5
yards a game.

Another player who should
prove to be an integral part of the
Panthers’ defensive schemes is
cornerback Gary Richard. The
5-foot-11 senior cornerback is

8 listed as a pre-season All-

American by The Sporting News.
Gottfried is impressed by
Richards maturity.

A third player who will be a
key part of the fortunes for the
defensive backfield will be Quin-
tin Jones.

The 6-foot senior cornerback
had four interceptions last season
and made steady improvement.
”Quintin got progressively better
during the season,” Gottfried
said.

Jones is expected to be another
source of leadership for the
Panthers.

One player who will not take
part in of the Panthers’ exploits
this season is free safety Teryl
Austin, who was declared inelig-
ible after it was learned that he
had signed with a professional
sports agent. Despite an injury-
plagued junior year, Austin aver-
aged seven tackles a game.

”Anytime you lose a player
with the talent of Teryl Austin, it
hurts, but he can be replaced,”
said Pitt assistant coach Jack
Harbaugh.

Although there are number of

possible players who could

replace Austin, Gottfried believes
junior Troy Washington has the
inside track to be the team's start-
ing free sfaety.

Among those who could
challenge Washington for the
spot are sophomore Marcus
Washington (no relation to Troy),
junior Michael Hadley and fresh-
man Louis Riddick.

Riddick, the brother of Buffalo
Bills running back Robb Riddick,
was a USA Today All-American
and could prove to be the sur-
prise in the secondary.

”| see our secondary as relying
more on speed and finesse, rather
than a overly physical unit,” Fox
said.

Forecasters see Billy Owens having a banner year.

has a shot at starting this season.”

”I don't think there is any
doubt Mark Spindler will help us
early,” added Gottried.

Along with Carter and Spindler,
there is Charles Swink, a senior
letterman who did not get to play
much last year. Dave Di’Tomma—
so and Scott Costy should see
playing time. Di’Tommaso, a
sophomore, doubled as the back-
up Iong snapper last year.

Tom Simko and Dave Santoro,
both walk-ons, should also see
limited playing time.

The most experienced of the
defensive tackles is junior Tony
Siragusa. In nine games last sea-
son, Siragusa had seven sacks.

By Ed Tureen

Staff Writer

According to Coach Gottfried,
"'[Defensive] tackle is really a
concern area for us.”

After losing both Walter John-
son and Lorenzo Freeman, there
is undoubtedly reason for con-
cern, but there is also reason for
hope.

At one tackle spot the Panthers
return 6-foot—5, 255—pound,
junior Tony Siragusa. The other
spot is still up for grabs; Jon Carter
appears to have the inside track
because of his experience.

But according to Coach Jack
Harbaugh, ”Mark Spindler [also]

According to Harbaugh, ”It is
important to remember that
Siragusa is a youngster.”

But Gottfried has high expecta-
tions for Siragusa this year.

’’I expect Tony Siragusa to pro-
vide leadership for us this year,”
said Gottfried.

Siragusa is going to play a key
role on the line this year, provid-
ing his knee has recovered from
off-season surgery. After earning
AP honorable mention AI|—East
honors last year, Siragusa will
have to provide more of the same
aggressive defense if this year's
defense is to approach last year's
ninth—ranked version.

The major problem facing the

line this season is depth. It is
important for the freshman to
develop quickly if the depth
problem is to be alleviated.

”Our front line is fine, but the
freshmen have to come through
for us,” said defensive coordina-
tor John Fox.

The Panthers had a fine recruit-
ing class this season and expect
it to pay dividends as the season
progresses.

Dave Dixon, a promising
recruit, is seen by the coaching
staff as a player who has a chance
to make an immediate impact as
a back—up.

The one thing all of the recruits
have in common at the tackle

position is speed. The slowest of 

these players runs a 4.9 40-yard
dash. This speed is important to

a team that plays attacking’

defense like the Panthers do. ‘

Chuck Williams, a former tight
end with a lot of speed, also has

a chance to see playing time for . 

the Panthers. Williams has been

hampered by a bad knee, but if-_ 

he has recovered, he could be a
major force at the tackle position.

Frank D’AIonzo, ”we can count, .

Tight ends

young, but

still   strong   

By Ed Tureen
Staff Writer

Tight end was a forgotten posi-

tion in the Panther’s run—and—. ’
shoot offense of last year, produc- _

ing only five receptions.

This year, the tight end position I

is a presumable question mark
and, according to coach Mike
Gottfried, ”Tight end is a position
of concern [for the Panther
team].” -
However, Gottfried wentvon to
add,”But I have _a lot of confi-
dence in Tom Huebner.” '

Tom Huebner, at 6-foot—6, 245' 

pounds, is being counted on to

_ step in and start at tight end.

”Tom had a great spring for us.

He is the physically dominating _ 2-:

type of tight end that we need,”

said John Harbaugh, a graduate ' I
assistant who is working with the

tight ends. -

For Huebner, the fact that there 

have been a number of tight ends
who have performed well has

helped him. ’’I feel I have 

improved because there is a lot
of competition,” he said.

The real battle at the tight end
position is for the back—up. No
one has yet emerged from the
pack, but there are a number of
worthy candidates. y

Dave Shuck, a senior who
missed all of last season with

injuries, is one of these players. ‘ I

However, becuase of his inexper-
ince, he may be a long shot.

According to Gottfried, ”David ‘I I

Shuck is a question mark.”
Another player with a chance
to earn some playing time at the
spot is Vernon Kirk, a junior.
Kirk has been shuffled around
among a number of positions,

which has hindered his deve|op- _
ment at tight end. But according ’ '
to John Harbaugh, ”Vernon is so _

talented and versatile. He is a
player who can go deep effec-
tively.'’

The last possible piece of thee»

tight-end puzzle is freshman
recruit Eric Seaman. ”There are
seven freshmen who have to play
for us," said Gottfried. Seaman
may just turn out to be one of
these freshmen. 4

Although Huebner is the starter

going into fall camp, Gottfried ,,:ft’i

stressed that any of the other play-

ers could “earn” the starting 5
position, , __ .-.1 .. , y‘

Returning defensive end Burt Grossman is again ready to hold up his end of the line.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August_3l, 1987

By Tarun Reddy

Staff Writer

The task that lies ahead for
defensive’ line coach Frank
D’Alonzo is an intriguing one.

D’Alonzo has to find someone
to fill defensive end Tony Woods’

shoes —— he graduated to the
NFL’s Seattle Seahawks.
This task is not the real

problem. The real problem is
determining how to incorporate
at least eight talented players into
two defensive end positions.

The plot thickens with the reali-
zation that senior Burt Grossman
would appear to have one of the
starting psoitions locked up.

D’Alonzo’s job is complicated
further by the prospect of deter-
mining who plays better in one-
on—One situations and who per-
forms better in team drills.

”As it is now,” D’Alonzo said,
”Jon Carter performs better in
team drills, while Marc Spindler
is better in one—on—one drills.”

Carter was responsible. for 42
tackles and six sacks last year.

These are impressive figures for
someone who didn't start.

Carter admitted he has to
improve on certain areas of his
game, though.

’’I definitely need to improve
on my endurance,” said Carter.

Many people feel Carter has a
legitimate shot at All-America sta-
tus this year. It is only natural
then to compare Carter and Hugh
Green, another great Pitt
defensive.

However, Coach D’Alonzo dis-
agrees with that assessment,
choosing to instead compare Burt
Grossman to Green.

Looking at another prospect for

the position, it would appear that
freshman recruit Marc«Spindler
has more pressure on him than
Carter does.
4 It's only natural to leave a lot of
pressure put on you when you're
selected as USA Today's High
School Defensive Player of the
Year.

”Well, I'm not too concerned
about starting, I think I'll be bet-
ter off if I just let things take their
course,” Spindler said.

Another player who should see
time at the end position is Carne
Smith. ‘ V

Coach Gottfired feels Smith.

improved greatly from his fresh-
’ man year. He was the recipient

of the Ed "Conway Award as the

most improved player in spring
practice.

If there is a sleeper for this
position, it comes in the form of
Chuckie Williams. . '

Williams recently had knee sur-
gery, but D’Alonzo is certain that
Williams is fully recovered.

What's unusual about the
seniorfrom Freedom, Pa., is that

he was a possibility for the tight .

end position as well.

Others who could receive con-

sideration include freshmen
Richard Allen, Nelson Walker
and Todd Pipken.
' And while there may be a
question as to who will start this
season, there is no question as to
who is the leader of the defensive
ends.

’’I think Burt-C-rossman is an
example of someone who leads
more by his play on the field
rather than by words,” said
Carter.

The Panthers defensive ends

_ last year were aproductive unit,

registering 28 sacks.

If the Panthers are to use their
defense to the fullest, the ends
will play a major role. When
ends exert pressure, the job of the

. secondary is much easier.

”Ultimately, someone will
emerge at the other starting end
position, and I'm confident the
position will be in capable
hands," said D’Alonzo.

Considering the players
D’Alonzo has to chose from for

the position, it's not hard to agree g

with his statement.

Newcoach excited with special teams I

By Tarun Reddy

Staff Writer

Scott O'Brien has an ambitious
goal in mind as he assumes his
role of special teams coach.

”I’m just excited to be part of
a winning tradition here [at Pitt],”
O'Brien said.

But tradition aside, O'Brien
realizes his immediate tasks
include the job of finding both a
new kick return specialist, as well
as identifying someone who can
return punts consistently.

That need arises from the loss
of both Charles Gladman and
Teryl Austin, both of whom were

declared ineligible for their senior

seasons after it was learned that
they had signed contracts with
agents Norby Walters and Lloyd
Bloom. Gladman handled the
majority of kickoff returns while
Austin handled punt returns.

However, O'Brien hopes to
compensate for their loss by
employing Billy Osborn and Billy
Owens in the return game.
Osborn has some experience
returning punts, averaging 5.7
yards per last year.

Some newcomers to the foot-
ball program may also prove to
play a bigpart in the success of
the return game.

One of those players is 6—foot
Henry Tuten, an academic
casualty who will have three
years of eligibility remaining.

Another player who looks
impressive to O'Brien is Mark
Williams. -

A walk—on, Williams impressed
the coaches by running a 4.4 in
the 40-yard dash after practice,
especially impressing Coach
Gottfried.

Another new face who could
see special-teams action is
Ronald Redmon, a 5-foot-I 1,
freshman running back from
Miami who received numerous
awards citing not only his athletic
but also his academic achieve-
ments in high school.

Louis Riddick, the highly tout-

ed freshman defensive back is

also expected to be a major fac-
tor on the special teams.

One area of concern for
O'Brien is the punting of John
Rasp.

As a freshman, Rasp averaged
38.9 yards a kick on 70 punts.

”John had a tendency to kick
the ball straight up,” O'Brien
said. ”That’s something he's been
trying to correct in the off-
season.”

O’Bri_en noted that Rasp’s hang
time (the number of seconds a
punt remains airborne) was
around 4.5 seconds, about aver-
age for punters.

As far as kicking is concerned,
that job belongs to sophomore
Jeff Van Home. The sophmore
from Spokane, Wash., converted
I I of 18 field goals and made all
29 of his extra-point attempts.

memorable moment came when
he kicked a field goal in the last
minutes of the Notre Dame game
topreserve a 10-9 Panther win.

”Van Horne’s greatest asset is
his confidence,” said O'Brien.

Another question that remains
unanswered for the Panthers is
who will assume the responsibil-
ity of long snapper, the person
responsible for snapping the ball
during punts. ‘

Center Chip Backauskas, a
senior from Allison Park, Pa., is
one of several candidates.

.»».> .«

Tight end Tom Heubner could
also be called upon to perform
the snapping chores. Heubner is
listed at 6-foot—6 and 245 pounds.

Freshman Mark Spindler could
also fill the role,'but O'Brien
didn't speculate on the fresh-
man's chances.

As with last year, Billy Osborn
will hold for field goals and extra
points.

The special teams, according to

O'Brien, must work as a unit in
order for it to be successful.

’Spec’ Ellison: don't ever sell him short

By Eric Reuscher
For The Pitt News

This fall when you spot head
coach Mike Gottfried on the side-
lines, it will seem that he has an
unlimited supply of headphone
cord. What you probably won't
see is the man whose job it is to
make sure no one trips or
becomes entangled in the cord.

The man in charge of this is
Richard ”Spec” Ellison.

Spec is the manager of the foot-
ball team. His job requires him to
be a jack-of—al|-trades because his
duties include just about every-
thing related to football.

’’Basically, I have to prepare
the team for home and away
games,” said Ellison. ’’I do the
laundry, pack up the uniforms
and check to make sure nobody
forgets anything. I'm also respon-
sible for making sure the players
are at their meetings on time and
that they are in bed by curfew.”

The hours are often long and
unrewarding, but Ellison doesn't
let this bother him. He has
reached his position through hard
work, dedication and because of
his love for the game of football.

This love for the game started
back in the third grade in Sturgis,
Ky. Spec started playing in the
peewee leagues when he was in
third grade and kept on for four
more years until his size prohibit-
ed him from continuing. To keep
him from losing interest, a.group
of his friends encouraged him to

become the manager of the

junior’ high team. This is where
he received his first taste of
managing, and his interest in it
hasn't left him since.

From junior high, it was on to
Union County High School. The

coach at the time was Mojo Hol—-

lowell who had received great
recommendations concerning the
work Ellison did while he was_
with the junio_r high team. Hol-
lowell called Spec into his office
and asked him to be the team

9 manager. He accepted the posi-

tion and filled it from 1973 to
I976. '

The night of their first home
game, a couple of players
approached Spec and asked him
to lead the team onto the field.
This is a tradition that has fol-
lowed him wherever he has
gone. But that night, the crowd
went ecstatic when they saw
Spec’s 5-foot—4 frame leading the
players out of the locker room.

’’It was really exciting leading
the team out every game,” Ellison
said. ”I’|l always remember the
crowd cheering, and the players
chanting for me. It made me feel
really good.”

Upon graduating from UCHS,
Spec decided to attend college at
Murray State University, also in
Kentucky. This is where he -met
coach Gottfried, and they've
been together ever since. Spec
spent seven years with the racers
and, when Gottfried accepted the
job at the University of Kansas, he
took Spec with him. The move
from MSU to Kansas was a big
step for Ellison, but it was one he
had been waiting for all hislife.

”When Coach Gottfried asked
me to go to KU with him, I
thought my ears were playing
tricks on me,” Ellison said. ”I

remember watching Big Eight _
teamslsuch (as Oklahoma _arid""~*

Nebraska'..-playtﬁon...TV?‘“arid--.

would be to be a part of such an
organization. I received such a
chance when I went to Kansas.”

For the next three years, Spec
worked at Kansas fulfilling a life-
long goal of being at a Division
I school. But, over all these years,
he did not let all his good fortune
go to his head. He has remained
dedicated to his job and is always
there to lend a hand whenever a
job is to be done.

His newest home became Pitts-
burgh two winters ago when
Gottfried accepted the coaching
position at Pitt. Spec knew that
this was the biggest step of all.
His successful career had finally
landed him at a school that is
long with tradition and one of the
top organizations in the country.

”I’ve been a Pitt fan since the
Dorsett era,” Ellison said. ’’It’s a
real pleasure to work for a univer-
sity [of] Pitt's caliber.”

Although most of his time is
spent working on the collegiate
level, Spec has had the opportu-
nity to work in the professional

I ‘ ‘. . -

I

ranks. He has served internships
at the Cleaveland Browns’ and
the Washington Redskins’ sum-
mer football camps for the past
two summers. He was also able
to work for the annual Blue/Grey
game this past winter when Gott-
fried served as head coach for the
Blue team.

”It was a nice change to go and
work at these camps,” he said. ”I
learned how to operate on a
different level. They taught me
new ways to do things [that] I can
improve on here at Pitt.”

It would seem Spec has
achieved just about every goal he
has set for himself, but there is
one more he has yet to attain. His
ultimate goal is to become a pro
manager. It is a goal that well
may be the toughest one to
achieve. He realizes that to be in
the NFL he has to be one of the
best managers in the business.
But if Spec’s past record is any
indication of how good he is, a
pro career may just be only a few
short years away. -

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 31, 1987

Recruit list ailing, but certainly not lamed

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

Pitt's T987 freshmen football
class lost four players out of 29
to Proposition 48, the NCAA’s
academic guidelines for freshman
athletic eligibility.

Proposition 48 claimed seven
of T8 Pitt freshmen recruits last
season. Four of those seven play-
ers — Adam Walker, Henry
Tuten, Eryck Griffin and Todd
Finley —— met Pitt's academic
requirements during their fresh-

_ men academic year and will play

for Pitt this season.
From this year's freshmen class,
Pitt lost: AYusef Washington, an

All-State defensive back from
Duquesne High School who was
recruited as a quarterback; Danny
Boyd, a Parade All-America run-
ning back from Norristown, Pa.;
Dale Banks, a running back from
Gateway High School in Mon-
roeville and Steven Israel, a
defensive back from Lawnside,
N.J.

All four players will not be
eligible to play for the Panthers
this fall.

At press time, Pitt coach Mike
Gottfried wasn't sure if any of the
four would enroll in school this
fall. ‘
if the players do enroll, each
one would lose a year of athletic

eligibility.

The players do have the option
of not enrolling and retaking the
SAT. If they retook the test and
scored the required minimum of
700, they would be able to enroll
in school next year and still have
four years of eligibility.

Pitt also lost recruits Ray Bell
and Andre Southerland. Bell, a
linebacker from Miami, Fla., did
not apply for admission and will
not attend Pitt this fall.

Southerland, a running back
from Butler County Community
College in Manassas, Va., has not
yet graduated from his junior col-
lege and, therefore, can not apply
for admission to Pitt.

Pitt's freshmen class has been
rated as one of the best in the
country and, not only are the
players some of the best
prospects in the nation, but three
stand out academically.

Mike Boykin, a linebacker from
Jefferson High School in Dayton,
Ohio; Eric Holzworth, a running
back from Thomas Jefferson High
School; and Louis Riddick, a
Parade All—America defensive
back from Pennridge High
School in Quakertown, Pa. —— all
are finalists for Chancellor's
Scholarships.

A Chancellor's Scholarship is a
merit-based award taking into
consideration past achievement

and potential for academic
excellence.

Approximately l0 Chancellor's
Scholarships will be awarded this
year from an incoming freshmen
class of about 2,600 students.

’,’I think that's great. [Boykin,
Holzworth and Riddick].are not
only good athletes, but they were
at the top of their class as stu-
dents. And when they. enroll
here, they'll be at the top eche-
lon of entering freshmen, so it's
nice,” said Gottfried.

”You talk about dreams, all
three of them have dreams of
being a Presidential Scholar or a
Rhodes Scholar. So their goals are

JOHNSTOWN — Mike
Gottfried is looking for some-
thing special in his players.-
Sure, size, strength and quick-
ness are all necessary factors
in developing a quality foot-
ball player, but Gottfried has
been, well, sort of like the Ma-
rines — looking for a few good
men.

”Leadership,” he stressed. ‘

”That’s what this team needs.
And on defense, especially
after losing a player of Tony

Olsavsky proves leadership
  to both his team and coach

Woods’ caliber, we are really
searching. But we feel that Jer-
ry Olsavsky is going to step in
and become a fine leader for
this football team.”
Olsavsky, a 6-foot—2,
212-pound middle linebacker
out of Youngstown, Ohio, an-
chors a relatively young Pan-
ther linebacking corps. And
although he led the team in
tackles last season with 127,
Gottfried is, without hesita-

. tion, expecting bigger and bet-

ter things from the junior.
”[Jerry] did have a banner
year in '86, no question about

that,” Gottfried said. ”And his
spring was fabulous. That
gives us every indication that
he'll be improving every
aspect of his game — pass
coverage, sacks, tackles, as-
sists, etc. But what we're really
looking for is his leadership.
His knowledge of the game is
outstanding, and we hope the
other players will respond
positively to his presence,” he
explained.

’’I did some good things last
year,” Olsavsky said. ’’But I"
was really too inconsistent. l’d

Three frosh may see the starting snaps  

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer '

JOHNSTOWN -— "Very rarely
can a freshman step into a college
football program and start,”
proclaimed Pitt defensive coordi-
natorjohn Fox. "He’d have to be
extraordinary.”

”Well, we happen to have
three who can," he continued.
”Not just one, but three. And
that's really something!”

As Fox spoke,‘ there was a flash
of anticipation and enthusiasm in
his eyes. He couldn't wait to get
going, to get ‘back out on the
practice field and start refining
the golden nuggets, mined in the
past recruiting year, into All-
America showpieces.

Three frosh — defensive tackle
Marci Spindler, free safety Lou
Riddick and quarterback Darnell
Dickerson — have taken the Pan-
therfall football camp by storm.

‘And to a team that lost eight start-
ers from the 1986 campaign, the

blessing certainly isn't in
disquise.

have a big game (17 tackles at
Notre _Dame, 16 at Syracuse) then
turn around and have a lousy
one. I've got to become a more
consistent ballplaver."

With the coaching staff being
in_ its second full year at Pitt,
Olsavsky beleives the Panther
defense will sometime soon be

among the best in the nation.

”When the new staff first came
here,” he said, ”they didn't really
know ‘what kind of players we

had here. Of course, they knew g

Tony Woods was good. They
knew Burt Grossman was good.
But they really didn't know the
rest of us and what- we could do.
Now that they've got two spring
camps as well as a full season in,
things are running a lot smoother.

”We won't be as predictable
on defense this year,” continued
Olsavsky. "Not saying that we
were overly predictable, just pret-
ty basic. The new schemes and
the new talent are really going to
help us get this defense situated.”

Panther fans probably remem-
ber Olsavsky most for his excit-
ing 57-yard interception return
for a touchdown‘ against Navy

I last season.

Olsavsky also chalked up two
and a half sacks last season, a
number he desperately wants to
improve.

"We expect to do a lot more
blitzing this season. With that, I

should be able to do a bit better _

than two and a half."

Known for his aggressiveness,
Olsavsky patterns his style of play
after the masochistic trio of back-
erswho play for the Chicago
Bears — Mike Singletary," Otis
Wilson and Wilbur Marshall.

”I like hard hitting football
players. Those three are about as
ferocious as they come,” said
Olsavsky. "They chase the ball
carrier all over the field, then
punish him formaking them run
so far. I just" like that style of play.

”As for me, I can't wait to meet
BYU and start hitting people,”
con_tinued5.O|savsky. "We kinda

265-pound lineman from Scran-

school credentials ’of any Pitt
recruit: USA Today Defensive
Player of the Year, AP first-team
All-America, Parade first-team
All—America — and that's just the
magnificent tip of the gridiron
iceberg.

”We like what we see in him,”
said Pitt football coach Mike
Gottfried on the second day of
Camp. "No question he'll

challenge right away for a start-

ing_position.” —

Easier said, than done. Spindler
was elevated to first-team left
defensive tackle after only the
third day of practice.

”He just moved right in and
took the job,” said defensive line
coach Frank D'Alonzo. "Put it
this way, we couldn't keep him
out ofthe lineup. The job is his

‘unless someone takes it away

from him, and that really would
take some doing;"

"You know,” said Spindler,
love it here. The coaches, the
intensity, the atmosphere, my
teammates — the whole system

is great.”

”We’re working extra hard in
practice ‘and, personally, I'm
picking things up a lot quicker
than I expected to at first,” con-
tinued Spindler. ”The coaches
will yell if you mess -up, but
they'll be right there to tell you
if you've done a good job. Every-
thing is going great.”

Dickerson to push senior Sal
Genilla forthe No. I spot all year.
‘ A four—year letterman at Martin
Luther King High School in
Detroit, Dickerson passed for
5,500 career yards and 56 touch-
downs. Rumor has it that he
learned how to throw the football
by reading Guns and Ammo
magazine.

"l’ll tell you how I catch the
ball when Darnell throws it," said
wide receiver Henry Tuten. "I
just stick my hands up and it's
right there, man. And usually, the
ball carries me farther than a hit
from a defensive back would,"
he added laughing.

Another first-team Parade All-
American is Lou Riddick, a sleek
6-foot-3 free safety from Quaker-
town's Pennridge High School.

"He’s big and*has great accel-
eration," said Fox. "A 10.5 in the
100 meters really says something.
He's an extremely intelligent
athelete (Riddick carried a 3.7
GPA_in high school), an excep-
tional talent. He's one of the best
prospects I've ever coached, and
he's only a freshman. He'll make

words to let a professor know that
l’m interested.  I've been run-
ning into that since I've been
here. So athletes get it from both
ends; they get it from the students
and the professors.

Q: How many people give you .

a hard time? Have you ever had
any problems on campus?

A: Yeah. Because l’m the type
of person that likes to keep to my-
self, people tend to say rumors
about _me and tend to say differ-_
ent things like l’m (big-headed,
l’m stuck up or whatever. All
those things are petty, and those
things are tolerable, and I can
deal with them. Just because of
the fact [people] don't know me,
they make up their own image of
me, and I hear things like that
through the grapevine, but it's no
problem whatsoever.

Q: You've been a major part of
making this program so success-
ful. ls that one your biggest
accomplishments here?

A: Yeah, that was another rea-
son why I stayed. I remember
visiting here and watching Pitt's
Blue and Gold scrimmage, and
there was nobody here. I had

both to be successful as a great
football player and also a team-
oriented player, but also to do
well in academics," he added.

_- Gottfried said that seven of the
freshmen will have to play for Pitt
this season because of the team's

lack of depth at many positions.

,j'You really don't want to play a

freshman. You hope to never be a
' in that situation, but we're in that

situation,” he said.

Gottfried pointed out that Penn
State had "about 27" fifth-year
seniors on its National Champi-
onship team last season. He said‘
he hopes Pitt can eventually get
on course for a fifth—year pro-
gram, but that won't be possible
this season.

"One of the things in a pro-
gram where you have a turnover
sometimes is that you get out of
sync of a five—year plan, and
you're playing your freshmen.
You would hope that you'd be

‘able to take your freshmen in real

slow, maybe let them mature and
have some fifth—year seniors,” he
said.

Most scouting services have
rated P_itt’s freshmen class as one
of the 10 best in the country.

Despite losing the services of
two of its top recruits —— Washing-

~ ton and Boyd — Pitt still has some

top—flight freshmen.

Defensive linemen Scott Hart
from Hampton High School,
Richard Allen from Cleveland,
Ohio, and Marc Spindler, a
Parade All-America from Scran-
ton, Pa., all stand a good chance
to play immediately.

Central Catholic’s Todd Pipkin,
Freeport’s Jeff Christy and Boykin
should help Pitt's thin linebacker
corps, while Riddick should
challenge for playing time at free
safety.

"This is the best looking group
[of freshmen] we've ever had. It's
the best looking group anywhere
I've, ever been," said Gottfried,

who added that as many as three .

freshmen could earn starting

  i.5..y?§[°. ~¢ gig‘: A ‘.531  5.4-. _ ’

   

seen Clyde Vaughan, but I didn't
know any of the players.

It was terrible. I really thought
I could make an impact here.
During my decision [to possibly
enter the draft], I thought about
that. I started a mission here, and
right about now, coming into my
senior year, I think it can be
accomplished.

When I leave they can say
Charles Smith is one of the main
guys who put Pitt where it's at. I

came in and [Pitt] was nothing, ‘

and I left and [Pitt] was something
— that's a big accomplishment
for me.

Q: What do you do to get away
from the pressure?

A: If things are bothering me
and l’m having a rough time, I
always call home or call my
mother. She's the first person that
I'll talk to. I pretty much sort out
the problem myself.

I never let things get me down.
lfl have a bad game, l’m coming
backthe next day and playing
better. I know that.

During the season, I definitely
stay away from the papers and
don't read stuff on the team. The
only thing I'll read on the team

are personal interviews.  When
it comes to commenting on
games, I don't read that stuff
because I don't see any reason in
it. And I keep away from it, and
it keeps me low key and from get-
ting big—headed, whether it's a
good or bad article.

Q: Is the Pittsburgh media
more critical of you as oppossed
to if you had gone to say, Con-
necticut, for example?

A: Yeah. I think [the media] is
critical, but again, it doesn't faze
me at all. I think I've learned a lot
of lessons through the years ..
like when Dick Vitale said Jer-
ome Lane was the crybaby of the
year. Things like that — the
media read that, the public read
that — and they don't know me
orlerome, and the [bad attitude]
is in their mind. That tells [the
public] how we are, and that's
not true.

When I played over in the
World [University] Games, I
wasn't.being [publicized] at all.
It was all David Robinson,
Tyrone Bogues and Kenny Smith,
and I turned out to be the lead-
ing scorer of the team, and I read
in the papers over here after we

came back —— David Robinson,
leading scorer of the U.S. team.

Even in that final game [against
the Soviets], they talked about
Kenny, Tyrone and Dave, and I
think I had 17 [points] that game,
and they didn't mention me,
things like that. It bothered me at
the time, but then I realized those
are the writers. The writers write
what they want to write, and
that's it — you can't do anything
about it.

Q: What do you like to do in
your spare time?

A: I go to the movies. During
the season, I don't have too much
spare time. If I do [have spare
time], l’m either doing some
work or resting and sleeping. In
the off—season, I go to the movies
and listen to music. I like to go
out to clubs once in a while with
Jerome and Demetreus [Gore].

Q: Do you guys like to party?

A: Yeah. Everybody likes to
party and unwind, and we just
like to have fun. But the thing is,
if I were to go down in Oakland
and have a few drinks,—then I'd
hear the next day everybody say-
ing, even people that work [at

Pitt], 'I heard you were down‘ at

Peter's [Pub] last night. I heard I .
you had one too many.’ I don't u

like to hear things like that, sol

stay out of there. It's not like I.

have to go in there anyway. 

Q: How do you feel about your

play on the court after three

seasons? * V
A: A lot of people here at Pitt
or across the country don't know
how I play. They've never really
seen the things that I can do,
because l’m playing a role. I've

been playing a role since I've '

been here.  .

In college, you have to blend
into what the coach wants you to
do in his system. I hope this year

everybody gets to see how I can ‘.5

really play before I leave.

Q: In Evans’ system, do you 

feel your game isinhibited?
A: Yeah. People definitely

don't know the things I _can do. "

Q: Will people see the way ’ D

you can really play this year?

A: Probably not, but l’m going _ 

to do my best and play as hard
as I can. -

.- his parents, he's no different than

some other snotty-nosed little kid.
They blew that all out of propor-
tion. Going to court over that was

I ‘like totally stupid.

Q: Do you resent the press?
After all, sometimes it can either
someone or break
someone.

- A: I don't like certain reporters.
But then again, it takes a strong
man to revive from something
bad.

Q: But how about in the court
case you were just referring to?

A: The only part the press made

I was the judge. I knew that was

going to get in the papers. She
told me, "And when you leave

 here, I want you to stop bother-
I ’ ing kids.” To which I wanted to

if I - say, "You in/—$!" I wanted to

 

call her everything in the book.

“And when they fined me, it was

like $370 or something. She

_ asked me ifl had the money then,

like I really walk around with that
much on me all the time. So her
attitude was totally’ off-the-wall,
and I think by her looking at my

size, she just totally misunder-

stood everything.

Now I'm trying to stay on a
clean streak just as long as I can
because in this big city for media,
whatever happens it will get into
the papers. The best thing is just
to try and stay away from any
way, shape or form from any kind
of trouble possible.

Q: And you've been trying to
do just that?

A: Oh yeah. I have no choice
but to. From all the trouble I've
been in before, the coach is
somewhat on the line. He'll have
people come up to him and say

. things like, "Well, he was in that

altercation when he was a fresh-
man, and now he's in another
one — why is he still on the
team?” If people really knew the
bottom of everything, and if they
were there, they would under-
stand it.

But no. They don't read the
paper and, the majority of the
time, it's a bunch of women who
sometimes read the sports section
and say things like, "Oh my God!
I don't believe he did that. A big
football player and all.” And
then, when it gets into their
hands, look out.

You get crucified over some-

. -A'A’A9 '. ‘I'D-‘I

thing you know you were in the
right over.

Q: Do you think athletes get
the rap more in cases like this
than others?

A: You got it brother. Situations
like drug testing. It's supposed to
be confidential. But you see

everyday something like, "Blah '

Blah Blah is tested for such and
such.  So and so going in for
rehab.” They're just taking some-
body’s life and throwing it out
into the street — like Dwight

Cooden. Everybody’s entitled to

mistakes.

But you'll get some little kid's
parents say things like he should
be kicked out of the baseball
league because he's setting a bad
example for little kids. But in real-
ity, this stuff's been going on for
years and years, and they're just
starting to make an example of it
now.

Q: How about education?
When you were growing up, was
school a big thing in your house-
hold and/or your life?

A: Before I got into football, I
would just go and attend, class,
but I wasn't really into it. Propo-'
sition 48 didn't come into effect

sVp' -7.‘. . '5"; \ ‘A’;

THE PITT NEWS, Mondciy, August 31, I987

until after my senior year. But
still, when things were being nar-
rowed down between my junior
and senior year, my teachers
were telling me [that] I didn't
have a 2.0 — that's when I really
started getting into it.

Q: But before that you were
basically just another face in the
crowd?

A: I was the class clown before
that. You know, cracking jokes,
getting people in trouble, instigat-
ing fights.

I was the opposite of a bully,
but I would still do things a lot of
bullies would do. You know, bul-
lies would like take peoples’
money and stuff like that. I would
do just the opposite. I would talk
to other people and have them

do stuff and start stuff. Then I ,

would be like, "Oooh, look what
he's doin’." Then they would get
in trouble.

The one thing I wasn't was one
of them nerdy kids who liked to
go to class. Instead, I would be
one of the ones who, when class
started, would ask to go to the

‘ bathroom and stay out for about

10 m_inutes. It was fun, though.
Q: What are you majoring in?

A: Criminal justice.

Q: Now that you're at Pitt, have
your attitudes changed‘ about
school?

A:-Yes, it has. I can see that
being in college has made me
learn something because when I
go home and see some of the
people I graduated with who are
now working and have a whole
bunch of kids already. Well, just
by having conversations with
them, I can see that the mentality
level has changed between them
and me. All they use is swear
words all the time. They can't
relate to anything without cuis-
ing. Or else they just use the
same word over and over and
over. So when I go home, I can
only communicate with them for
so long before I have to say some-
thing like, "Well, I'll talk to you
again whenever I get back again
so you take it easy,” and then I'll
avoid them until next year or
something. '

Q: Craig, there's been some
bad tidings lately about football
players here at Pitt, and it is
especially centered around
agents. The Charles Gladman and
Teryl Austin incident in particu-
lar. How do you feel about this
situation? .

A: Eventually, the NCAA is
going to totally ban any agent
from coming into contact with
undergraduates. ‘

Q: Do you think college ath-
letes should be paid? .

A: In a way, we are being paid.
We get tuition, room and board,

etc. Plus for the away games, we; 

get money for meals when we. _

_ come back. So any more than‘, 
that, Ithink it's overdoing it. B

What we get is enough. . ‘

Now the NCAA just passed the _

rule that college athletes are now
allowed to work, and that's OK
because every little bit helps —
some people do need it.

I think that if athletes are
looked upon as role models, then
they should volunteer themselves
to go, say to a correctional home,
and speak and stuff and, while
doing that, get an internship for
their major or something. But as
far as getting paid, we're getting

enough. Hell, we're getting more ,

than the regular student.

Q: Almost everybody here
knows you as lronhead. It's been
rumored that you don't like that
as a nickname and would rather
have it be something else. Is there
any truth in this?

A: No. I can live with it. I don't
object to being called Ironhead,
as long as it stays within the
sports aspect of things. You
know, in sports names like that
are appropriate. You've got Nate
"The Dart" Heyward, "The
Demolition Boys," "The Force"
or "The lntimidator." I can accept
the nickname as far as in the

. world of sports, but in a business

atmosphere I prefer Craig.

Q: We all remember that Bill
Fralic liked to wind down with
golf, beer and women. What
does Craig Heyward do to relax?

A: Well, I just recently got into
golf, and I love it. It's really a
great game. I love tennis. Some-
times I just like to go out with the
guys and have a good time. And
then there are the women.

Now, I can't focus my attention I

on all women. You know, some-
times you have your "groupie”

section who love to hang around. '

athletes and stuff. But at this point
in time, I'm seeing only one very
fine young lady, and I'm very
pleased. ' '
