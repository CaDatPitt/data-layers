Sailors hall will be prohibited. by
the election judges.

N ews Poll Shows

“Are you interested in Men’s
council?” and “Do you intend“
to vote?” were the queries ask-
ed over 100 students in a poll
concerning tomorrow’s election
of Men’s council. Tabulation of

~the results to both questions

F rats, V ets Get Letters
'(Ed1'._tor’s, note: ‘Letters went out last week-end to two of the
largest groups of men students on campus, fraternity men, and veter-

ans..Although there is an intermingling of these two, leaders of the
groups felt their stand on the Wednesday elections should be clariﬁed.

Dear Vet;

The following is bound to create
quite a stir. That is as it should
be. When honesty and fair play
become a political has been, some-
thing or someone should create a
stir. This will, in all fairness, be
without a slant. The truth in the
matterwill be issue enough.

The Veterans association in the
past ‘has been a non-politicalrac-
tivity. It would, and should, have
remained’ that way. No doubt you
haveheard the old story of having
a life-line threatened. That is the
case with the PVA today. Our
very life-line is threatened by the
presence of a political powerhouse
that threatens to sweep the forth-
coming election. I feel no better
stating -that, this , power-house is
Fraternity}, It should notvbe this

way- We have no.‘ feudwith the
fraternities. Many of our mem-

bers are brothers within their or-
ganization. ,Whatever the cause
for a split has been, they have
caused it. i _ ’

The PVA is an independent or-
ganization. The majority of its
members are the same.‘ The ratio
of fraternity men in the school is
one out of everyseven. Why then,
of the seventy-ﬁve (75) selected
nominees for Student congress
and Men’s council, are sixty (60)
of fraternal background? This is
a good question.

There, is moreto the story. A
section, of IF council held an off-
'th‘e-record secret meeting Tuesday

'l\/larch 4; The reason for this meet-

ing and the outcome were one.
They .pre-picked a supposedly
sure winner slate. This slate was
made up by, and pledged for by,
IF council. The reason is appar-
ent; the fraternity slate is un-
scrupulously sure of 1000 votes.
They have thrown one indepen-
dent into their slate. {Truly a

To All Fraternity Men:

At a regularly scheduled meet-
ing. of IF Council on March 4,
1947, at the Pi Lambda Phi
house, the enclosed election slate
was adopted and the unanimous
support of the thirty-two IF Coun-
cil delegates present, representing
ﬁfteen Pitt fraternities, was pledg-
ed. Council was exercising (the
privilege and responsibility of any
representative body in informing
its constituency of the candidate
considered most able. ‘ '

. IF Council, feeling a strong con-‘

cern for better, student govern-
ment,lattempted to consider can-
didates impartially on a merit
basis. The fact that only one in-
dependent is being supported" by
the fraternities is due in part to
the small number of independent
petitions submitted, although we
recognize the fact that we un-
doubtedly showed preference, con-
sciously or unconsciously, to the
men we know best. As your rep-
resentative body, we present this
slate to crystalize our concern for
a better. student government. By
backing this slate, your chapter
can further this movement and
at the same time continue the
consolidation of IF Council.

Pitt independents soon will form
their own organization — “The
Non-Affiliated Student associa-
tion.” Although the association’s
aim is to provide a social program
for non-fraternity students, it
claims to be neither anti—frater-
nity nor anti-anything.

Four planks constitute the Non-
Affiliate platform for tomorrow’s
election, In proposing its slate, the
association listed (1) more lock-
ers, (2) men’s. recreation rooms,
(3) proportional representation for
men and women in Student con-
gress, and (4) more dances in the
fall . semester as election objec-
tives.

 

Non-Affiliates Organization

Supplants Independents Party

Bill Lytle, Joseph Shaffel, Bryan
Black, and George Concelman are

members of the informal commit-
tee on organization. A general or-
ganizational meeting will not be
until after this week.

The Non—Affiliated Student as-
sociation is a new organization
and should not be confused with
the pre-war Independent associa-
tion.

“We are not a political group,
but will take part in school pol-
itics,” states Lytle. “We will pro-
vide the Pitt independent an op-
portunity to express his opinion on

all phases of school life.”

   

°ternity group, were Bill Lytle, junior college candidate for
Men ’s council, Martin Lubovsky, and Gerard Obert, senior and
junior candidates for Congress. ,

iFurther complications entered the already. heated scene
with a letter mailed to 5000 veterans by Stuart Workmaster,
president of the Pitt Vets association. The letter trounced fra-
ternity political control but doesﬁnot express a deﬁnite pref-
erence for either slate or individual candidates. Workmaster,
college sophomore candidate forCouncil, oﬁicially appealed to
the veterans to vote for the “best men.”

The independent slate is an outgrowth of dissiatisfaction
concerning "IF council’s original selection. Normal independent
opposition and three Greek groups under the direction of_‘Mar- i
shall Levy, president of the current Congress, pavedthe wayl
for ﬁnal action by the NASA.

In this, our election issue, the News is supporting no
“party,” no candidates, and no interest groups. We, are tak-
ing a‘ path right down the middle of -campus_pol1-tics by pre-
senting to you, the voters, all sides of the election as they have
come to light in our office. _ . 

We do, however, join all groups in ask1ng_that you vote.
Our only support is thrown wholeheartedly behind the passing
of the amendments to the constitution of Student congress.
A Without these, no group will do justice to their offices.

 Gain;/tau '

This issue of the News is not strictly FOR MEN ONLY.

True, Wednesday’s elections are limited to men voters,
but it would be well if the. women on campus would take par-
ticular notice of the most important thing at stake in the elec-
tions-—the adoption of the proposed amendments to the Student
congress constitution. ‘ ,

Regardless of the outcome of the election, which side,
or which men win, the approval of the student body on the
proposed amendments is imperative. Without these amend-
ments next year’s, congress .,will be hamstrung in the"same
manner as the present -congress and Pitt students will con-
tinue to complain abou “no action.”

Perhaps an explanation of the proposed amendments is in. order.
The ﬁrst ‘amendment is a comparatively harmless one. It merely
makes legal a practice long in existence, that of sending to congress
meetings representatives of both the Dean of Women and the Dean
of Men instead of the personal appearance of both at. all times.
-, The ‘second amendment is the one with which we are concerned.

The by-laws of the” present Student congress can be amended only
at an election of the entire student body which, in our particular
case, takes place in the spring. This means that if next fall rolls
around and there happens to be 21,000 men students in the University
and only 1,000 women, students that congress can do nothing about
the clausethat reads, “There shall be fourteen student members of
Student congress, seven men and seven women”——until the Spring
election at which time there may be no need for the change.

There are many such stipulations ‘in the constitution which take
the't1:=.eth out of any action members of the congress would like
“to ta e.

If you as a voter, whether it be tomorrow or not until
April when women’s elections will take place, do not cast
your vote for the adoption of these two amendments, and
most particularly the second, that of amending the amend-A
ment article, you will be ‘defeating any positive action that
any future congress may wish to take. You will be con-
doning a constitution that gives Student congress as little
power as possible but yet lets it be called a student congress.

Men, if you do not wish to vote for any of the candi-
dates running in tomorrow’s election, do not defeat the
amendment because of it. It must be passed by 2/3 vote of
the student vote cast and because you make 3/4 of the
student body the success or failure of this amendment is
in your hands. ' .,

- Section 2, Article 3, Advisers. There shall be three advisers
of the Student Con ress: The Dean of Men, the Dean of Women
and one member of he faculty elected annually by the Student
Congress to serve for one year. They shall have a voice, but no

vote in the proceedings of the organization.

Phi Eps, 39-27  

PiKA scored a stunning upset at
Trees Gym last Thursday night by
defeating the Phi Eps, 39-27 and
thus casting the title race into a
deadlock. Both teams now have
ten wins and one loss.

If neither team is defeated in
this, the ﬁnal week of league play,
the two frats will meet in a play-
off.

Chances of the PiKA’s being
beaten are slim, as; their only re-
maining game is with the Alpha
Phi Delts on Thursday. On the
other hand, Phi Ep may have
rough sledding when they face the
Delta Tau Delts on Thursday.
The PiKA-Phi Ep affair was
more of a foul shooting drill than,
a basketball contest. A total of.
59 fouls, including three techni-
cals, were called.

Although the victors were be-
hind 14-13 at half-time, Johnny
Gallagher, PiKA sharpshooter,
was staging a one-man show,
scoring 12 of his team’.s 13 points.
Suddenly coming to life in the
third period, the PiKA’s soared
ahead and were threatened only
once when the Phi Eps pulled up’
within two points in the fourth
quarter.

Gallagher led the scoring with
14 markers, while Phi Ep’s Bruce
Gilbert and Curly Weitz had ten
and nine points respectively.
