Government Officials Receptive

'by.SUE HOENSTINE
Three representatives of the
University Committee for Wom-
en's Rights (UCWR) who visited
Washington. D. C.. Friday felt
that government officials there

are more receptive to their re—,

quests than Pitt administrators.

Ina Braden. Judith Kapsal and
Pat Roberts met with personnel

” from the Department of Health.

Education and Welfare (HEW) to
determine the status of Pitt's re-
cently-disputed Affirmative Ac-
tion Program.

A news release from the fem-
inist organization states. “Ac-
cording to top level HEW person-
nel. any new federal contract
money for Pitt has been held up
since last October and will con-
tinue to be held up until Pitt's Af-
firmative Action plan has actually
been accepted by HEW. Prior to
acceptance of any proposal. HEW
officials stressed that it must be
submitted to the complainant
(UCWR) to obtain any final com-
ments or information which the
complainant might have. This has
not yet occurred. which recon-

,firms the fact that Pitt's plan is

not yet accepted. HEW also de-
nied having specified any percen-
tage estimate of how close Pitt
has approached the goal required
by HEW."
Roberts
(UCWR)

related, “Since we
initiated the suit with

\ HEW we must be the last to sit

down and discuss the University’s
proposals.” So far, she claimed,

“The administration has refused
to deal with UCWR concerning the
Affirmative Action Program."
She feels that_the University is
negligent in trying to comply with
only a _minimum of the feminists’
demands.

Dave Powers. assistant to the
Chancellor on Academic Affairs.
feels that UCWR has misinter-
preted the nature of the Affirma-
tive Action Program. “It is an on-
going program. and. as problems

 

PAT ROBERTS;

are identified. we will act to rec-
tify them. The Affirmative Action
Program should not be viewed as
one that is completely acceptable
at any point in time."

Powers also said that last week
he contacted the New York office
of HEW and was assured that Pitt
was taken off HEW‘s control list.
The list contains the names of uni-
versities that have not met re-

a

quirements outlined by HEW.

The feminists also visited sen-
ators on Capitol Hill and White
House officials to confer on wom-
en’s rights. Roberts said that
cases of discrimination are a top
priority of the Nixon administra-
tion.

The UCWR news release con-
cludes. "During the course of a
two-hour conference at the White
House. an official stated that he

could see the similarities between
the Women Civil Rights activities
and efforts to impede them and the
Civil Rights efforts of blacks.

“At the conclusion of the meet-
ing he asked UCWR officials to
keep him regularly informed
about their activities so that the
Federal Government can be more
informed about and responsive to
the needs of women." '

Vrana Conducts Surveys

by LORETTA HORRELL

In response to students and em-
ployee demands. John Vrana. di-
rector of University Housing. has
found it necessary to conduct sur-
veys on the present food service.
on increasing the security system
in the Towers. and on increasing
housing fees.

FOOD SERVICE

Recently. surveys were con-
ducted on students‘ attitudes to-
ward Saga Food by the Boarding
Food Service Committee and the
Non-Boarding Service Commit-
tee. The results of these surveys
will aid Vrana in studying Sagas
contract.

“The present contract with
Saga expires Aug. 31,” Vrana re-
marked. “The contract is re-ne-
gotiable every year, if both par-
ties agree to the terms.”

Vrana feels that there are only
about five food services that can
capably handle a school the size
of Pitt. “The University is one of
the largest universities in the
country that has a contract oper-
ator," he explained. "Most
schools of our size operate their
own food service.“

The University has in the past
few years contemplated the idea
of owning its own food service.
“The school cannot be sure it can
secure a competent manager." he
commented. “By hiring a contract
operator. we are assured man-
agement expertise —— purchasing
know-how and menu planning.
Contract operators have the re-
sources and experience."

SECURITY

In response to student de-
mands. more students have been
hired to check IDs in the Towers.
The desk attendants are obligated
to check each student for identifi-
cation. A security officer has
been stationed in the main lobby

between the doors leading into
Towers A and B.

Locks have also been placed on
stairwell doors at the garage lev-
el to ensure entrance to only those
students with dormitory keys. The
elevators in the Towers, locked at
lobby level, will not go to the ga-
rage area after 7 p.m.

“We would like to install se-
curity doors similar to the exist-
ing doors in the top house of Tow-
er B in all the houses in the Tow-
ers." he said. “This system will
permit students a maximum
amount of security. Presently. we

I _ I
.'_‘,‘i_ . " ‘r

are working with limited funds.“

With the aid of the Residence
Hall Advisory Board. Vrana will
conduct an opinion poll in the Tow-
ers. The objective would be stu-
dent self-determination on mat-
ters concerning security.

HOUSING

Vrana recently indicated in a
newsletter that was sent to all
resident students that there would
be a need for an increase in hous-
ing fees if the contract between
the Building Service Employees
Union, Local 29. and the Universi-
ty was ratified.

The contract has been ratified
by the union and signed by the
University. The housing increase
will go into effect Sept. 1.

Sidney S. Spatz, D.D.S., has
been appointed professor and
head of the Department of
Oral Surgery at the School of
Dental Medicine. The appoint-
ment was announced by Ed-
ward J. Forrest, dean of the
school.

Dr. Spatz received his under-
graduate and dental educa-
tion at Pitt and has served on
the faculty of the School of
Dental Medicine since 1948.
He is a fellow of the American
and International College of
Dentists and chief of the Den-
tal and Oral Surgical Services
at Montefiore Hospital.

The residents of the Oakwood Apartments at 234 Oakwood Ave. 
fear they are being victimized by the University. Mrs. Betty Coppola’, 
a member of People‘s Oakland, stated that the University deceived‘ 
those present ata Model Cities meeting two weeks ago. ' if -

The purpose of the meeting was to present residents of the ’ne_iglal_-:_ ,
borhood with the University's plans for the east side of Oakland Ave.—-gt 
the law, social science and education complex. ~ I

At that time, a tenant of the Oakwood Apartments asked Univeirsity_i-,7?»
officials if they were consideringany development on the west side of’ A 
Oakland Ave. Hunt Martin, director of the Physical Plant, replied that I 
he was unaware of any University activity in that area. ' '"  

The following Sunday tenants of the Oakwood Apartments received‘ 5-?
notice that the University had bought the property and would be oper,-Q 
ating as landlord through J. J. Gumberg Realty Company. ‘ 4 “

As a result. Mrs. Coppola, who is also a commissioner-elect to the.‘
Model Cities Program. asserts that the people of west Oakland .-Ave‘. -.
“just don't trust the University." Because of the contradiction. the oc- ' ff
cupants consider their security in jeopardy. ' s '

According to Dennis M. Casey. associate director of News— and
Publications, the misinformation was an unfortunate “breakdown of
University communications.“ The University representatives were not 
informed until after the meeting that the property had been purchased, 
he said.  f

 

In response to the tenants’ concern that they will be forced to move, . —
Casey explained that the building was acquired for investment. pur- . 
poses only. Investment properties, he maintained, are never used as -

Casey considers the tenants “a lot better off." The Gumberglfirm‘ _ -

 Daniels Explains   Functions    

 

by CAROL SCATES

Misconceptions and stereotypes
from super militancy to inactive

i... passivism have grown around

Black Studies since its introduc-
tion as a department within CAS.

’. To aid in clearing confusion

E about what Black Studies is all
about, Chairman Jack Daniels de-

, fined its role and function within
 the University.

“Black Studies,” Daniels stat-

 ed, “is the vanguard of academic

change. The University of Pitts-
' burgh and other universities sys-

ematically neglected the study of
world black experiences.

“For example,” he began, “in
’ the English Department, African
and Black writers have tradition-
ally been neglected. There’s al-
ways been a racist interpretation
of history. The Sociology Depart-
ment stresses the white middle-
class view. Therefore, the Black
Studies Department was formed
to present the truth to the white
student and provide a curriculum
revelant to Blacks.

“When I say world black ex-
perience, I mean that, the total
black experience,” he emphasiz-
ed. “The Black Studies Depart-
ment offers 50 to 60 different
courses covering the total range
of black experiences.

“Black Studies courses,” Dan-
iels explained, “contains the com-
munity. There is a field work
component within each course,
designed to allow the student to

It's 89 ways better than a Volkswagen.

The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.

It gives you Cl smoother ride and a shorter turn-
ing radius than the Beetle.

it even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-

gine than the Beetle.

All told, this car has 89 things you've never

seen inside the Beetle.

In fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the Beetle anymore.
, So we gave this car, whose mild-mannered ex-
terior masks its ‘true identity, a new name.
We call it SUPER BEETlE.

observe what he learns.

“For whites,” he continued,
“Black Studies can provide an in-
valuable experience for learning
about the lives of black people.
The white student lives in a ra-
cist society, and he may learn the
truths here concerning blacks.

“For blacks, Black Studies
gives added preparation for prob-
lems they'll face later on, and
functions as a legitimate field of
academic research and analysis.”
Daniels said that all students can
elect Black Studies as their ma-
jor and will be able to attain a
masters degree by 1973. A doctor
program is also planned.

Discrimination against whites
is not a policy of the Black Studies
Department, according to Dan-
iels. “There is no class offered
within our department to which
any student in the University can-
not attend," he stated. “The only
reason a student may not be able
to attend a class is that he may
not have the necessary course
prerequisites. For example, to
take Swahili II involves the com-
pletion of Swahili I. If there are
any complaints on the part of the
students, see me.

“Black Studies is not a place
for ‘rapping,’ a way of getting
‘A’ grades, a local hangout for
militants who reinforce them-
selves with Black rhetoric, a su-
gar-coated ‘Black Is Beautiful’
situation, or a place to hate
whites,” he said.

Another misconception sur-
rounding Black Studies is that
many students do not fully reco-
ognize this department as a legi-
timate enterprise. According to
Daniels, “This feeling of infer-
iority is another reason for the
existence of the Black Studies
Department.”

In addition to existing courses,
the Black Studies Department
also functions‘ outside the aca-
demic community. There is an
African Exchange Program
where students spend a year in
Africa.

A program has been establish-
ed in the Western Correctional
Institute for the Black inmates.

An undergraduate Student Re-
search Team is being organized,
which will collect data both from
and for the black community. The
results will be available upon re-
quest.

Black Studies sponsors a float-.

ing university which gives public
speeches and lectures.

Another function is the com-
munity institute, which is being
formed as an alternative to the
existing school system which, ac-
cording to Black Studies, is not
operating the way it should.

The Black Studies Department
here at Pitt is the most outstand-
ing one in Pennsylvania and is
probably the best in the country,
according to Daniels. The State
Department of Education has ask-
ed-Pitt’s Black Studies Depart-
ment to serve as consultants to
all state colleges to develop re-
lated curriculum.

When asked about the response
from the white administration,
Daniels commented, “Although
the administration has formally
sanctioned the department, I am
still experiencing psychological
dissatisfaction. This stems -from
racist attitudes and fear. Bomb-
ings, take-overs, burnings, and
other political action across the
country have helped to Create this
atmosphere.” ‘

Under the circumstances, pros-
pects for eliminating the sex
breakdown in job classifications
are dim. In the medical field, the
United States ranks only higher
than Madagsacar, Spain and Viet-
nam in its percentage of women
doctors. Dr. Minerva Btuerk,
president of the American Medi-
cal Women’s Association, pointed
out in a recent speech at the Uni-

versity that while “51 per cent of I

the population is female, only nine
per cent of all doctors are.”

The Affirmative Action Plan,
filed by the administration to the
Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare, revealed that
only six per cent of all full pro-
fessors are women, 11 per cent of
associate professors, and 20 per

cent of assistant professors, in- A
structors,\ assistant instructors, -

and lecturers.

On the other hand, women rep-
resent 94 per cent of the 1,234
clerical and office personnel.
Much work is to be done and the
odds are against immediate suc-
cess.

With all the talk in recent
years about a “new politics” bas-
ed on fresh and innovative ideas,
it is saddening to discover that
very few of these ideas are eith-
er fresh or innovative. '

They consist mainly of rehash-
ed New Deal promises or mind-
less collectivist slogans of the
New "Left, and there is nothing
in the general ethos of “respect-
ed opinion” that is fundamentally

_ different. -

The financing of higher educa-

tion is a striking example. The"

usual scheme of things is for
government to subsidize selec-
tive institutions through direct

“grants. The subsidized institu-

tions are referred to as either
state operated or state related

 

DONATELLI

schools, depending on what
proportion of their budget is
paid for by the government.

This method is so accepted
today that debate as to its wis-
dom is almost nonexistent. The
only questions in the minds of
many is, “How much shall each
school get?” Apparently, the
“new politics” has not seen fit to
raise this issue, but the situation
of today (Pitt is an excellent ex-
ample) dictates that the practi-
cality of this scheme must be
discussed.

The weaknesses of the state re-
lated approach are several. First,
it is completely arbitrary as to
which institutions are subsidized.
There is no generally recognized

criteria as to which school should \

get what. _
Why, for example, should Pitt

‘receive $48 million of state mon-

cards back but also receive an
apology from the Athletic de-
partment.

P.S._ Is it better to have a
crowd of one fish and 3000 peo-
ple or no fish and 300 people?

Are Very Relevant

Editor: Pitt ‘News;

As a student in General Stud-
ies, I feel compelled to com-
ment on a letter of Miss Mary
Lou Murphy in the January 29
Pitt News. .

Miss Murphy’s major argu-
ment against the proposedmentor
system in the university is that

.“‘New Politics” and Pitt’s Financial Future

 

ey while Duquesne and Carne-
gie Mellon get almost nothing.

What is inherently better
about Pitt that it should be THE
school to benefit?

The answer is, of course, that
there is no objective reason. Pitt
just happens to have more
friends in government, thereby
creating a situation where poli-
tical influence determines who

gets the money. Should Pitt con-.

tinue to receive a large state
subsidy while other schools get
none, it is conceivable that these
private institutions will die out,
thus resulting in more homogen-
eity and sterility for higher edu-
cation.

There are other shortcomings
to the present system. Subsidiz-
ed schools are assured of amount
of money, thereby causing them
to be less frugal when it comes
to managing financial affairs.
After all, the state will ultimate-
ly bail them out. Yet they don’t
know exactly how much x will
be, so they are constantly ex;
periencing “financial crises.”

Finally, with so much of their

budget coming from the state,
there is the danger of losing
academic freedom and becom-
ing pawns ‘of the government.
After all, the power, is where
the money is.

Now Pitt has experienced all
of the problems described above.
Yet the only answer we hear is
for MORE state money. This is
at best a short term solution to
the problem. Probably the best
way to restore diversity to high-
er education is to remove govern-
ment from the business of edu-
cation and rely upon the spontan-
eous forces of the free market.

Yet this can’t be done overnight
and it becomes imperative to seek
an intermediate step to finance
the education of those already in
college.

An excellent suggestion was’
put forth for Pennsylvania last

fall. by former Lieutenant Gov-
ernor Raymond Broderick in his
campai -n for governor. His solu-
tion was sound: Stop giving bloc
grants to INSTITUTIONS be-
cause none has more intrinsic
worth than another.

Instead, the aid should go dir-
ectly to STUDENTS who need
it, so we can be sure that th
needy get the aid. ’

This would. be a type of vouch-
er system for higher education.
Needy and deserving students
would get a cash grant toward
tuition charges at the school of
their choice, not at an institu-

   

“indifferent if
hostile", and seemingly unin-
terested in their studies. She.
further contends that group dis-
cussions have little or no value
in a university setting;

There is no doubt in my mind
that General Studies students
are interested in their studies.
but there reason is primarily for
the sake of the “sheepskin”.
General Studies affords the work-
ing student the opportunity to
advance him or herself through
the receipt of a degree earned
during non-working hours.

By the time most General Stu-
dies students arrive at class, they
have completed a hard day at
work in support of families, mor-
tgages, and time

perience is lost. W Y

tion which happens to have pol-
itical.Plill. The student would be
in a position to determine which
institution is worth more via his
“dollar vote. ”

One corallary must betadded
to the Broderick proposal. ‘The
state scholarship plan (or multi-
million dollar boondoggle)
should be, scrapped. in favor of a
loan program, either publicmor
private, at reasonable interest
rates.

Students should really sitdown
and ask themselves if it is fair
that doctors, lawyers, and pro-
fessors be subsidized by truck
drivers, waitresses, and laborers.
It seems that this is the worst
form of regressive taxation and
should be changed.

..Now of course this plan will
be fought by the huge educa-

tion lobby in general, and en- ,

trenched bureaucracies like the
Pitt Administration in particular,
who benefit by the present sys-
tem. No bureaucracy even vol-
untarily reduces itself in size.
When Mr. Broderick was here
last October, one administrator
follishly proposed that the state
guarantee a college education to
everyone, much as it now guar$
antees a high school diploma.

Now of course this is a very
narrow view of the responsibili-
ties and resources of the state.
It is unfortunate that a man
withia supposedly liberal educa-
tion cannot see beyond his own
little enclave. If he could, he
would havd realized that educa-
tion is but one of an infinite
amount of things society would
like to do, but cannot under-
take. I ‘

To finance education so that
everyone could get a college de-
gree would require that resources
be taken from other vital pro-
jects, in addition to taxing the
citizen to the breaking point.

In like manner, the state relat-
ed concept is but a short-range
solution. Pitt cannot afford one
financial crisis after another.
And it must be admitted that even
though we students like Pitt
and benefit from the present sit-
uation, this system cannot and
should not continue.

Either we act now to revitalize
the private sector of education,
or we face the bleak prospect of
the state taking over all phases
of higher education in the future,
its stifling hand restricting all
releases of creative human ener-
gy by reducing everything to
the lowest common denomina-
tor.

 
  

In The Medium is the Mess-
age, Professor Marshall McLuhan
states: “The youth .of today are
not permitted to approach the
traditional heritage of mankind
through the door of technilogical
awareness.

The only possible door for them
is slammed in their faces“ by a
rear—view-mirror society.” As
“the student finds no means of
involvement for himself,” a new
methodology is proposed by Pro-
fessor McLuhan: The teach-in.

The teach-in represents an attempt
to shift education from instruction
to discovery, from brainwashing stu-
dents to brainwashing instructors . . .
The teach-in represents a creative
process from package to discovery.

We hereby agree to end the war on the following terms, so that both
peoples can live under the job of independence, and can devote them-
selves to building a society based on human equality and respect for the
earth. I ' ‘V

". tion based on color, class, sex, national origin and ethnic groupings, which
form the bases of the war policies, presentand past, of the United States.
I, The Americans agree to the immediate and total withdrawal of all U.S.
forces from Vietnam and to publicly set the date by which all U.S. mili-
tary forces will be removed. _

organize democratic elections. All parties agree to respect the results of
elections which all South Vietnamese can participate freely, wifhoul
the presence of any foreign troops.

7. The South Vietnamese pledge to enter discussion of procedures to

The Peoples’

Peace Treaty:

A ‘Convinoer’ about the War

by MICHAEL SIMON

The People’s Peace Treaty was de-
signed to be “a convincer” for those
unsure or unconvinced that the Vietnam

-war should end immediately. Histori-

cally .speaking, there were originally
two treaties, one written in North Viet-
nam by student representatives from the
National Students‘ Association (NSA),
and students from the Democratic Re-
public of Vietnam (DRV).

The other treaty was created in

is South Vietnam by student representa-

 

. mary proposal deals with the necessary *-

I the American government,

.. «. tives from NSA, Provisional Revolution-
‘. ary Government (PRG), which is an or-

ganized anti-imperialism faction in

South Vietnam, and various non-affili- V

ated student leaders. Both treaties were

- then combined into the People’s Peace

Treaty in Paris during December. “The
points in the treaty have the endorse-

. ment and support of literally every or-

ganized group of Vietnamese not in the
hire of the U.S.”

Explanation

Essential to its understanding, an
interpretation of the Treaty is necessary
as in several instances ambiguities in
the phrasing of the various provisions
cloud the actual meaning. of the doc-
trine.

The initial and highly stressed pri-

speed of the immediate and total with-
drawal of the U.S. forces in Vietnam. To
acquire documentation of the intent of
a public
deadline is to be set, assuring the Viet-
namese that the foreign troops will be

I5 — gone.

Point two of the Treaty is consider-
ed to be “a major concession to the U.S.
forces.” As soon as the American gov-
ernment sets a public date for the with-
drawal, the Vietnamese will “enter dis-
cussions to secure the release of all
American prisoners, including pilots cap-
tured bombing North Vietnam.”

‘The differentiation is made between
American prisoners and captured pilots
as the North Vietnamese view the pilots
to be war criminals, which is consid-
ered to be an international crime hav-
ing far more serious ramifications that
the “ordinary” prisoners of war.

Stop Blood Bath

Another effect of the second propo-
sal is -to prevent the occurence of “a

bloodbath” of slaughtered American pri-
soners, and pilots.

The “immediate cease-fire between
U.S. forces and those led by_the Pro-
visional Revolutionary Government of
South Vietnam” in the third declara-
tion of the Treaty encompasses a great-
er scope than expected.

Forces led by the South Vietnamese
PRG include coalitions of previously
neutral organizations. Included are the
Patriotic Catholic Forces of Vietnam,
various sects of the Buddhists, in addi-
tion to the PRG controlled North Viet-
namese troops.

Discussions on the guaranteed safe-
ty of all withdrawing troops, is men-
tioned in the fourth proposal to elimin-
ate any possible occurence of attacks
made on the departing armies.

This point was facilitated by the
Vietnamese to present as few hazards
and slowdowns to the American depar-
ture as necessary.

Connotations . . . .

Connotations of the Fifth declara-
tion of the treaty realize it to be “per-
haps secondary in importance to only
the first statement.” This pledges the
Americans to “end the imposition of the
Thieu-Ky-Khiem regime on the people
of South Vietnam in order to insure
their right to self-determination and so
that all political prisoners can be re-
leased.”

There is no guarantee or pledge of
free elections in the term “self-determ-
ination”; It. merely binds the Ameri-
cans to retract all support whether fin-
ancial or political for the present gov-
ernment in South Vietnam, in order to
alleviate any coercement in the upcom-
ing Vietnamese elections during Sep-
tember of this year.

The sixth proposal pledges the for-
mation of “a provisional coalition gov-
ernment to organize democratic elec-
tions.” Absent in Vietnam at this time
will be foreign troops whether American
or North Vietnamese to assure an “elec-
tion in which all South Vietnamese can
participate freely.”

Safety of those that had any poli-
tical or economic collaboration with the
U.S. is dealt with in point seven of
the Treaty. Many feared that there
would be wholesale executions of the
“collaborators” if the Americans would

@1971 Krupp Comic Works Inc.

leave the country.

Explanation of this “guarantee of
asylum” leads to a study of a similar
historical example, that of Mao Tse
Tung’s revolution in China. Anticipated
was an enormous bloodbath when the
communists gained control over the
country, but to the amazement of all,
very, ‘very few deaths resulted. This is
the desired outcome in the Vietnam sit-
uation.

Reassurances

The eighth declaration of the Trea- ’

ty reassures the countries bordering on
Vietnam; namely Laos and Cambodia
of no threats of aggression by either
Vietnam or the U.S. in, accordance with
the 1954 and 1962 Geneva conventions.

The ninth and final proposal which

asks for Vietnam and" the U.S. to “re-
solve all other questions in the spirit of
self—determination and mutual respect
for the independence and political
freedom of the people of Vietnam and
the United States.”

The legality of the Treaty is a di-
mension of the doctrine that must be
given fair examination. There is only
one law in the United States which ap-
plies to the Peace Treaty, the 1789
Logan Act.

In effect, the law states that “no
treaty may be made between the citi-
zens of different nations without the
support of their respective govern-
ments.” It is interesting to note that
this law has never been used, not even
against its original violator, a Quaker
named Logan.

In order to illustrate the con-
cepts of the People’s Peace Trea-
ty to the general public, region-
al workshops were held to consid-
er methods of implementation to
create support.

Discussed at one such work-
shop, were possible approaches
to the problem of introducing the

of a long term “revolutionary
consciousness” of the ideas ex-
pressed at the conference and in
the Treaty itself.

Western Pennsylvania, parti-
cularly Pittsburgh, is indexed na-
tionally as a highly industrial,

' conservative area due to large

numbers of blue—collar workers
typical of any “industrial city.”
This immediately presents a
problem in the psychology used
to sensitize, or to “raise the
consciousness” of the area.

Students present at the West-
ern Pennsylvania workshop

agreed that in influencing the
average citizen, the “boom or
bust” nature of the May Rally
should be played down, and the
goal should be to get the war
In community work, the prin-
ciples and policies of the Treaty
should be discussed and students
should. relate to the community,
whether in residential or business
areas to reach other people at
their own levels.

The Vietnam war, and its bad
effects must be illustrated and
applied so that the average citi-
zen can grasp it easily, in terms
of economic, social, or political
effects.

This requires personal contact
with people, regardless of the
medium — be it leafletting or just
going out and talking, and get-
ting the ideas across.

Bringing the Treaty to students
opens new avenues of approach.
If students communicate’ with
other students, concerning the
Treaty, its concepts could pos-
sibly move to stop complicity
with the war at the University
level.

By stopping University re-
searched, government funded de-
fense department programs, for
example, on a nation-wide level,
the government could be isolat-
ed, cut off from any student or
university support.

This type of economic mani-
pulation could present a possible
“softening” in the present ad-
ministration, a show of such
power might create a greater
governmental receptivity to the
provisions of the Treaty.

Whether mass demonstrations,

billboard advertising, or pro-Peace

Treaty speakers, the main theory
is to “effect public opinion” in
any manner available.

A’; Movement Trends Redirected
To Community Involvement

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

The “Movement”, that amorphous
collection of anti-war dissidents, is un-
dergoing a metamorphosis likely to rad-
ically alter its character and appeal.
The Ann Arbor Conference, while dis-
organized and sprawling, brought out
the political trends that are changing
the movement from a performance-
oriented parade into a community-dir-
ected coalition.

Rhetorically speaking.
The Peace Conference, intended to

bring together the diverse elements of ‘

the movement, reverberated in its work-
shops and plenary sessions the impor-

tance of discontinuing the one-shot de-v

monstrations that have characterized
past thinking.

Several workshops, such as the Mid
West Women’s Caucus which included
the Pittsburgh’s female contingent,
stressed the necessity of using the
May Day mobilization to set up com-
munication links with communities.

“or: Elitism”

The Seattle May Day caucus urged
in a statement that: “The demonstra-
tion in Washington, although critical
to the success of the Peace Treaty, can-
not be an end in itself. People should
not drop on going projects, but should
relate them to the war. One of the
weaknesses of the peace movement has
been its inability to relate imperialism
to the lives of non—student non-hip com-
munities . . . Elitist attitudes will have
to change. We will have to talk ‘to and
learn from people we normally ig-
nore.”

Although nearly all radical ideolo-
gical groups were represented at the
Conference — American Indian, Chi-
canos, Women’s Liberation, Gay Liber-
ation, GI’s for Peace, Communist-So-
cialist Alliance groups, Black Libera-

«tion, Youth, Students — , a political out-

look more cohesive than in other times
laced the proceedings.

Speakers in assemblies and discus-
sion groups tied the War into the ec-
onomic, political and social structures
of the country. Chants of “Ho, Ho
Ho Chi Minh; the NLF is gonna win”,
taken up by hundreds at the Confer-
ence contrasted with the 1969 Washing-

ton Moratorium where pro-Hanoi “es-
tremists” were criticized.

The movement has been strength-

ened by the severing of “liberal”
hangers-on and the grafting of pre-
viously alienated segments — such as
the Welfare Mothers and GI’s for

Peace. Last week, 55 former Viet Nam
Veterans signed the Peace Treaty with
the pledge “if it is not adopted, we
will march on Washington with or with-
out support.”

I Viet Support

Recent developments in South Viet
Nam have given movement efforts to

, curb and end the war a major shot in

the arm. Asian scholar Cynthia Freder-
licks reported at the University of Mich-
igan based convention that “national
reunification and reconciliation" are
concepts pushed by formerly compla-
cent Southern groups.

The Saigon Peoples‘ Front for the
Defense of Peace newly organized coa-
lition, uniting previously pro-war fac-
tions such as Catholics and some wom-
en, labor and student groups, has call-
ed for immediate troop withdrawal and
has initiated communications with U.S.
activists.

The Front, founded on November 7
by 200 Saigon citizens, has organized,
in cooperation with the National Liber-
ation Front (NLF) and the Provisional
Revolutionary Government of South
Viet Nam (PRG) to drain support from
the Thieu-Ky-Khiem regime.

Growing numbers of U.S. troops
are transferring the benefits of their in-
surance policies to the Angela Davis De-
fense Fund and the White Panther
Party, according to Vet for Peace Tim
Butts.

During the past year, Saigon has ex-
perienced a series of street demonstra-
tions and riots supported by Saigon
students and workers and in part by
American servicemen.

Despite the dominant push to com-
munity involvement, the movement is
split from within on several levels. The
major difference revolves around stra-
tegy and tactics. Many are coming to
feel that terrorism and bombing are in-
effectual and counter-revolutionary be-
cause such acts force the uncommitted
to decide between revolution and “the

Wednesday, February 10, 1971 -THE PITT NEWS—Page 7

system” before such a choice is realis-
tic.

Even the Weathermen, known to
openly advocate terrorist methods, have
released a statement rejecting them as
“elitist trips.”

Not Through System

Although they have no confidence
in working “through the system” to a
effect change, many radical groups have
placed new emphasis on using availa-
ble legal and legislative channels.

A Conference proposal to stage a
demonstration in support of
White Panthers jailed on evidence pro-
cured through wire tapping was shot
down by the May Day and Women’s
Caususes and the Panthers themselves.
The reasoning is summed up by a mim-
eoed statement distributed by Panthers
hours before the scheduled march.

“The White Panther Party takes the
position that such an action would be
completely negative and counter-produc-
tive. We’ve been working to exhaust
the legal machinery, to raise the con-
sciousness of millions of Americans as to
the contradictions in the system . .  .
Many more people are learning about
the true nature of the power structure’s
system of Just-us from this legal man-
euvering than they would from a mad
dash down South U. A riot tonight would
just TURN THEM OFF, effectively
stopping the ongoing education provid-
ed by this trial.” '

The anti-demonstration decision of
the May Day Caucus was a potentially
significant breakdown in the leader-
ship of the Yippie clique which pres-
sured to approve it.

Movement superstar Abbie Hoff-
man, sporting relatively short hair
compared with the shags populating the

three A

 

Conference, led no rallies and gave no
speeches, participating primarily as an
observor.

Self-Defense

There is a place, however, for de-
fensive violence in the form of civil
disobedience. May Day plans suggested
“demonstrations should be non-violent
but disruptive — blocking streets, march-
es, strikes at schools and other places of
work. To be effective - le. to provide
the spark that can coalesce the oppose
the war into activism- we must be
willing to do more than march. At the
same time, our tactics should not be
seen as provocative even though those

‘ sorts of tactics may well be just."

The Conference served a cultural
purpose as well as a political one. En-
tertainment on the second night was pro-
vided by two all—female rock groups
and menu plans for the two meals that
were included in the 5 dollar registra-
tion fee offered brown rice with vege-
tables, scalloped tomatoes, a potato and
cabbage casserole and whole wheat
bread sans butter, — all organically pure
and tastelessly bland (at least to
many).

Few black faces hid ‘behind the

beards, although Panthers Bobby Seale_

and Ericka Huggins, charged in New
Haven, Conn. with kidnapping, for-
warded a statement of solidarity with
the Conference, urging that their sup-
porters initiate protest demonstrations at
the end of their trial.

The three day gathering broke Sun-
day, promising “a real escalation in
the anti-war movement devoted to com-
munity consciousness-raising and end-
ing the war in Indochina. The Peace

Treaty, it was hoped, will provide the ~

means.

Viet Peace May No Longer Be Attainable Without Violence

by BOB GING

The Student Youth Conference
on the Peoples Peace was both
futile and fruitful. Fruitful, in
that it reaffirmed for many the
longstanding beliefs that peace
was attainable and that the war
in Indochina could be brought to

an end by the people. Futile, in A

that it was probably the last con-
ference concerned with finding a
non-violent means to end the war.

Many questions came to my
mind, and many will remain for-
ever unanswered.

One question is what kind of
country produces men who will
kill and mutilate other human be-
ings for any reason, no matter
how just? The answer is simple.
Any country will produce them if
it goes to war.

Accusations on our part and on
the part of our enemies that each
in turn are committing unmen-
tionable atrocities are valid and
accurate. War makes men that
way.

I ask also, is it worth the mur-
der and genocide of a nation for
any reason? Again, the answer
is simple. NO!

Why then are we engaged in
a constantly growing war that is
killing hundreds of people each
day? Why are we using plastic
anti-personnel bombs, whose fra-
gments lodge themselves in the
flesh and remain there for life,
being undetectable by x—rays?
Why, are we fighting at all? The
answer here is not so simple.

Some people say we are pro-
tecting democracy. Some say
we are protecting capitalism.
Some say the military industrial
complex keeps the war going to
put more money in it’s pocket.
Some say . . .

Does it matter what anybody
says? For once in our lives, the
grey has cleared away, and we
have an obvious case of .black and
white. The war, this war, any
war, is wrong. There has never
been a war that has accom-

 

plished any permanent good.

The second World War stop-
ped Hitler, granted, but how
many of the same atrocities that
roused the world to stop Hitler
are being perpetuated today in
Vietnam.

Two hundred years ago, we
had a revolution based on liberty
and justice for all..Two hundred
years later, we have poverty, ra-
cism, oppression and the war.

By now, many readers are
getting sick of being bombarded

with this type of moralizing.
They should be sick. I find it
hard how‘ to comprehend any-
one can read any newspaper day
after day, and read about death
after death and not get sick.

The Peoples Peace Treaty is a
beginning. It is the beginning
of the people from one nation
saying to the people of another
nation that we are tired, sick and
tired, of the fighting and the
killing that our governments are
forcing us to do.

One of the many speakers at
Ann Arbor said, “The Vietnamese
people are not our enemies,
they are our brothers and sis-
ters. With the Peace Treaty we
can establish the solidarity we
speak so freely about.”

Few lessons can be learned
from war, since man refuses to
learn that war is the most griev-
ious forms of wrong he can
possibly commit, but “they have
shown us one of the most impor-
tant things about a peoples war
. . . a peoples’ peace."

RICH TI-IORNGATE
Pessimistic Outlook
Our government has consistently

told us, (since the early parts of the
_Johnson administration) that the‘ Viet-
nam conflict was rapidly drawing to
an -end. Rather than ending it has grown .

so fargout of proportion‘ that the future
ofthe conflict can only bepessimistic.

While in Ann Arbor, as early as Fri- ,

day night, weiwere informed that a new
invasion of Laos was taking place. Ac-
cording to Allyne Rosenthal, Indiana

University student, and a speaker at I
the conference, “30,000 troops are in-

vading Laosled by Americans.” She
also pointed out that 10,000 more troops,
led by Americans were currently in
Cambodia.

“It’s just the beginning of a mas-

sive buildup . . .to sweep Indochina,”_ _

she stated. I‘ ‘The administration continues
to escalate the war. This new escalation
is as outrageous as the invasion of Cam-
bodia.” »

(The local papers reported the’ in-

vasion of Laos on Monday, and even

I; the “Monday New York Times" could

only say “Helicopter Traffic Indicates
South Vietnamese Force isIPreparing

to Move In.”)

But, the war is more than ‘simply a

that there is a growing possibility that

specifically, cobalt mines. ,

Swimming Coach Bill Grant seems to feel that the Pitt
News Sports is out to get him fired. He is incorrect as far
as past policy of the paper is concerned, but, you know, his
departure might _not be a disaster the way things are going
these days. ‘

In case you hadn‘t noticed, a few swimmers have public— “

ly voiced disapproval of Grants coaching abilityand recruit-
ing practices. The gripes are very basic—the swimmers say he

of them citing Grant as their
reason for leaving.

Rick Rowe and Mark Cohen have been the more vocal
of the swimmers, but both indicated they wouldn’t qui't—until
last Monday. (See article below)

“I just couldn‘t take it any more," Rowe said yesterday
after officially joining the ranks of the ex-swimmers.
“Things weren't happening."

Grant says the swimmers haven’t confronted him.

“Well, as far as those who have quit, none of them came
to me,” the coach said over the telephone last night. “It was
all of a sudden. They haven’t said anything face-to-face.”

Rowe and Cohen have mentioned that they would both
like to rejoin the team to prevent its extinction — but they
refuse to swim under Grant.

Grant has been given more money for recruiting, but it
doesn’t help him this year. There are only eight swimmers
and three divers remaining on the roster. "

With everyone quitting, the question becomes
there be a ‘nextyear’ for the Pitt swimming team?”

Wrestling coach Dave Adams is running out of grapplers,
too. The count of those starters who will not see action this
season has reached five, and captain Bob Kuhn is slated to be
off the mats for at least four weeks.

With the wrestlers, the problems are a mixture of physi-
cal ones and personal ones. Regardless of the reasons, Adams
is fielding a squad that is minus five athletes who had com-
piled a combined 15-1 mark this winter. The breakdown is as
follows: Bob Kuhn, 6-1; Randy Payne, 4-0; Willie Soloky.
2-0; Steve Weiss, 2-0; Mark Payne. 1-0.

I find it difficult to believe that readers feel that the

opinion of someone quoted in an article is also the opinion‘

of the article’s author. That's a common reaction I have re-

Three More Swimmers Quit

By JAN FRY
The number of swimmers who have quit the

‘Pitt swimming squad, denouncing Coach Bill

“Jo

Grant. has risen to six.

Rick Rowe, Mark Cohen and Tom Hayes, top

freestylers. decided after a loss to Temple that
they were “Putting up with it too long.”

“We decided, then. to quit after the Ameri-

can U. meet." remarked Rowe. “We had a

chance to win, and we didn't want to ruin it for

the rest of the team." Pitt defeated American U.
last Friday for the only win this season.

Grant said only comment was, “I was out re-
cruiting yesterday. I heard about them quitting,
but I haven’t talked to the boys and don’t want to
make a comment at this time.” ‘

Rowe and Cohen, who were the first torpub-
licly voice their objections concerning the seim-
ming situation, maintained that nothing has been
done to remedy the alleged problems.

“Mr. Grant hasn't done any recruiting," stated
Rowe, candidate for the Easterns. “He might say
he has, but there aren‘t any new swimmers.”

Hayes described recruiting as his “big beef."
“When we were freshmen” he ex lained we

   

had the aspiration to be NCAA champs, but we
don’t have any recruits."

In regard to the coaching, Hayes believes that
teams always have trouble with the coaches. But
he says that the fault lies with the coaching when
talking about the team’s improvement.

“I’m perturbed,” he said. “When I/came to
college, I wanted to improve, and I haven‘t. I’d
say 30 per cent of the fault lies with me and
70 per cent with the coach.”

Cohen pointed out. “The coach has to plan the
season. And our day-by-day practices have no co-
ordination and no peak”.

Rowe continued by explaining, .“I’ve given
up. I really haven't practiced at all. Easterns are
something you shoot for, something big. It's better
that I quit now than go through another season
like this one.” The top free-styler remarked that
his times this year have been the worst ever.

Do the swimmers think they will be accom-
plishing anything by quiting‘?

Rowe stated bluntly, “I hope so, it has to — it
better. The athletic department doesn’t realize the
problem."

and 5-11 Andy Young of Mount
Lebanon. Both are scoring in
double figures on the season.

Bill Cress, the Titans’ 6-5 cen-
ter. has also been a point pro-
ducer, averaging over ten points
per game. Rounding out the start-

» ing five is Paul Colombus.

“Colombus is 6-5," said Judge,
“but he’s just coming off of a
knee operation that he suffered
in the beginning of the season.
He’s just starting to work him-
self back into the line—up.“

Westminster’s frosh have had
an erratic season. They downed
Slippery Rock twice and then
lost to Youngstown and Geneva.
They've also defeated small
schools like New Castle Business
College, Youngstown and Beav-
er County Community College,
while losing to Buhl Community
Business Center twice to round
out their 6-4 tally.

“We always expect a good
game out of Pitt," said ‘Judge.
“Our biggest problem is that our
height isn’t too good."

On Seasons,

by MARTY HELLMAN

Tonight Pitt Coach Buzz Ridl
will get another chance to ‘re-
turn home’ at Westminster Col-

lege in New Wilmington, Pa. 1-

as the Panthers face the Titans
at8p.m.

Ridl guided Westminster for

twelve years prior to__his ap-_

pointment here. He compiled a
216-90 record there, including a

number-one small college rank- _i .1

ing in 1962.

In the past two seasons, Ridl’s
Panthers have won three of five
games with the Titans. Both
losses came in his first year at

Pitt along with a win in the-

Steel Bowl as the Cats whipped
them twice last season. I‘

Two of the top scorers for the
Titans were recruited by Ridl
four years ago. Gary Brown, de-
scribed by Ridl as “an outstand-
ing player who always does

well against us,” leads the squad ,

with a 12.1 scoring average.

Another starting senior is Ran- —

dy Huey who is averaging 11.7
a game. Last Saturday night,
Huey hit for 24 points in a los-
ing effort against Slippery Rock.
Ridl regards him as “a very good
shooter.”

Two other starters average in
double figures for the Titans.
Fred Rothen, a 6-6 sophomore is
hitting 12 points a game, while
Sam Males, a 6-1 soph, is netting.
11.7 points.

According to Westminster

Publicity Director Larry Judge,‘

the Titans have been erratic in
achieving their 10-8 record this
year.

“We were going real well
(winning three in a row) until
Slippery Rock and they didn‘t

play well at all,” he said. ._ ‘

The Titans and Panthers have
had three common opponents
this season, Gettysburg, Carne-
gie-Mellon and Bucknell. Both
squads have beaten Gettysburg
and Bucknell by similar mar-
gins. while the Titans have split
with C-MU, and the Panthers
ripped the Tartans in their only
meeting.

Ridl is still cautious of West-
minster despite their losses to
teams like Akron, Cheyney State,
Indiana State and Youngstown.

“They have a real fine team,”
he commented. “They are good
shooters and use the fast break
a lot. Their squad has good ex-

perience and may be a very dan- - I

gerous team. "
Westminister’s top rebounder,

6-7 Ray Bridge, does not start _

because of back trouble but will
see considerable action in the
game. , -

The only recent Panther in-‘

jury was to Bob Cizmarik who
sat out the C-MU game because
of water on the knee.

Kent Scott still leads the Pan-
ther in scoring with slightly

over 13 points per game. Close ‘

behind are Paul OGorek and
Mike Paul, who are both aver-
aging over 11 points a contest.

Ridl admits that playing at
Westminister, “makes it kind of
tough and that it looks like it

will be a very tough game.”

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

A seven-year veteran of the Na-
tional Football League usually has
more than a few scars to testify
to the viciousness of the game of
football. Dave Meggyesy. who
was really too small for his line-
backing position, absorbed more
than his share of physical punish-
ment during his seven years as a
St. Louis Cardinal. But for Meggy-
esy. repeated physical injury was
not the only factor that lead him
to eschew football as a career.

“You can learn to play through
pain.“ he said. “But what's more
important is the dehumanizing
aspect of the game. Football is

i like a war and the relationship be-

tween the coaches and players is
authoritarian."

In his book Out of Their League.
Meggyesy explains his disen-
chantment with football at the col-
lege and professional levels and
his decision to quit the sport.
Some of Meggyesy’s revelations,
including those of rampant ra-
cism and use of drugs in the pros,
evoked storms of protest from
people inside and outside the
game.

In town Monday to promote
sales of his book. the 29 year old
Meggyesy talked about the reac-
tions to his expose and about his
charges against football.

“My mail has been’ running
about 10-1 in favor of the book."
he said. “Some of the players
have also reacted favorably. No-
body could honestly deny any of it.
since all of it's true."

Meggyesy noted that racism
among the pros, which he villifies
in his book, is on the decline.
“Many of the younger players no
longer will stand for it. It used to
be that when the unofficial team
leaders were racist, nothing could
be done about it. Now, the blacks
are banding together and getting
some publicity.”

Drugs, he says. are there for
those that want them. “Most of
the team physicians and trainers
dispense the stuff willingly. I
mean you can get all kinds of
speed for the asking.“

Meggyesy is the most cele-
brated of about a half-dozen foot-
ball players who came to view
the game as inimical to their life

styles and quit. Chip Meyer. a
promising young linebacker. left
football to live on a commune.

Meggyesy also follows in the
literary tradition of Jim Bouton
and Leonard Schechter, each of
whose books helped shatter the
traditional golden-boy image of
the American athlete. But where
Bouton’s book glows with ingen-
uous humor and Scheehter’s
sparkles with the urbane wit of a
polished writer,‘ Meggyesy’s ac-
count is a cheerless picture of a
sordid seven years.

‘fl suppose I could have em-
ployed a little more humor." he
conceded. “but after a while. it
gets to be a really sick joke."

Meggyesy also has unkind
words for the recently deceased
Vince Lombardi. who has been all
but defied since his death.

“Lombardi was representative
of the fascistic mind, the ‘love it
or leave it’ mind. Every coach

I've ever played for has been the
same. Every coach is a variation
of the same theme.

Meggyesy’s criticisms of col-
lege football are no less trench-
ant than his complaints against
the pros.

“College should be primarily a
place for education. College foot-
ball players are exploited. ripped
off. Football doesn‘t build their
characters. it builds obedience.“

Meggyesy singled out Arizona
State Coach Frank Kush as a par-
ticular among collegiate coaches.
Errant players at that school are,
according to Meggyesy, beaten
with a club or a two-by-four with
a nail in it.

At Meggyesy’s own alma ma-
ter. Syracuse University, meth-
ods were not quite so brutal.

“If we put out for the Coach
(Ben) Schwartzwalder. we were
given money under the table."

Meggyesy reports that he accept-
ed payola while at Syracuse.

Meggyesy does not see an easy
way to humanize the game. “Foot-
ball has to be critically analyzed,
turned around, so that the players
are on an equal footing with the
owners and coaches.”

That promises to be a monu-
mental task, especially when
players themselves are reluctant
to change. Meggyesy recently ap-
peared on a talk show with Bout-
ton, Willie Mays and Henry Aaron.

Bouton found that Mays and Aaron
weren‘t listening to them.

“They didn’t react at all,” re-

what we’re saying is true, but as
establishment men, they couldn’t
admit it.”

to sacrifice his individuality to

What you should know about diamonds
when you know it's for keeps

 

You've dreamed about your
diamond engagement ring a thou-
sand times. But now that you
know it's for keeps, it's time to
stop dreaming and start learning
about diamonds and their value.

Because no two diamonds
are exactly alike, jewelers have

adopted exacting standards to de- ,

termine the relative value of each
and every diamond in the world.
These standards include a dia-
mond’s size (carat weight), color,
cut and clarity.

ASTROLITE

 

COLOR: Fine white diamonds are
quite rare and valued accordingly.
Other shades in relative order of
their

worth are:

 
     
   

blue, yellow,

brown and black.

CUT: The cut of a diamond-the
facets placed on it by a trained
cutter—brings out the gem's ﬁre
and brilliance. Anything less than
correct cut reduces beauty, bril-
liance and value.

CLARITY: Determined by the ab-
sence of small impurities. A per-
fect diamond has no impurities
when examined under ten power
magnification by a trained eye.

CARAT: A diamond's size is
measured in carats. As a diamond
increases in size, its price will
increase even more if the quality
remains constant. But larger dia-
monds of inferior quality may ac-
tually be worth less than smaller,
perfect diamonds.

 

Although it's important to
know the facts about diamonds,
you certainly don't have to be an
expert to choose a Keepsake Dia-
mond Ring . . . because Keepsake
guarantees a diamond of ﬁne white
color, correct cut and perfect clar-
ity or replacement assured. The fa-
mous Keepsake certificate provides
permanent registration, trade-in
value and protection against loss
of diamonds from the setting.

Confidence and rhythm are im-
portant factors for Mike Paul.
Pitts 6-5 junior forward from
nearby Baldwin. This season.
Paul is averaging over 11 points
per game and is one of the leading
free throw shooters on the Pan-
ther squad.

Last season. Mike led the Pan-
thers in scoring in five games and
hit for the same 11 point average
over the campaign as a sopho-
more.

He attributes his experience as
a soph for his better playing this
year. “Last year. we were pretty
green and got off to a bad start."
he said. “Even though my playing
time is down from last year. I am
more confident this season in my
shooting.

Although Mike is announced be-
fore each game as a forward, he
would rather call himself a guard
on Coach Buzz Ridl’s squad.

“Our offense is geared for the
guards to shoot and the coach has
helped me with my shooting con-
fidence.“

At times. Mikes rhythm has
been off and his shootihg percen-
tage plummetted. Against Penn
State it seemed like he couldn't
buy a basket as he went only 5-for-
16 from the field.

Earlier in the season, he had
his high game of the year against
Kent State with 24 points. Recent-
ly, he topped Panther scorers in
both the Temple and Bucknell
contests.

"There is definitely a rhythm to
good shooting and when I am open
sometimes I tend to shoot more
of a set shot rather than my nor-
mal jump shot."

Although Mike has attended Pitt
for four years. he is only a junior
eligible. In the first week of prac-
tice of his original sophomore
year he broke his ankle and sat
