Increased Loan Funds .

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Tabbed Best in . ‘Year

By NANCY DELANEY

A marked increase in the availability of loan funds will

be coupled for the spring term with theexpanded curriculum
and'an increased program of extracurricular activities. ‘

Due to a new federal law raising the amount an institu-
tion can borrow, the loan situation for the Spring and Fall

is better than it has been for the past four or ﬁve years,
revealed Thomas Fabian, assistant director of student aid.

f‘Ther_e may not even be enough students applying to use all
the money available.” Fabian also indicated that he hopes for

an increase’ in scholarship funds¢

tor the fall -and winter.

' Students attending the spring
term will be able to apply for
these low interest National De-
fense Student Loans until March
i1l5, rather than the previous dead-
line of March 1. Applications will
be accepted even later than that
if a last-minute rush necessitates
it, Jack Chritchﬁeld, Director of
Student Aid, has indicated. The
deadline for aid applications for
the fall and winter is also March
"'15.
; ' 10 Years To Repay

Any» American citizen enrolled
ctull-time in a‘ degree program is
eligible for the Defense Loans.
The loan may be paid back at a
rate’ of three per cent interest an-
nually -beginning one year after
the completion of studies, and
payments can be stretched over
a ten year period.

_‘ The ‘expanded extracurricular

program for the spring will be
sponsored by the, Student Union
Board and the Oﬁices of the Dean
of Men and the Dean of Women,
frvvhich have been ‘asked to submit
additional budget requests in or-
der to increase and improve spring
"activities in areas such as the
-{Midday - Lecture Series, student

tiances, .. and the Summer Film

Festival. A
', Expansion V of course offerings
for the third term is also contin-
uing, and__ students are urged to
check with their advisors ‘about
registration for the third trimes-
ter. .. ‘

‘ 22 Courses Added

So _ far, 22_ undergraduate
courses have -been added to the
Liberal Arts curriculum over last
year, ﬁve in Humanities, seven in
the natural sciences, and 10 in th
social sciences. ‘

The graduate curriculum has‘

been increased by 26 courses; and
General Studies by 18. There will
be 221 Engineering and Mines
courses, compared to last spring’s
program of 186. Both Engineer.-
ing and Mines and Humanities
will be offering 80 percent of their

Group to Keep F rosh Camp; A

Activity Saved by Protests

Dean Rush Denies Cancellation

Student "leaders here have successfully protest
to abolish the freshman camp program. ' .
In the light of the protests, the Orientation committee revised their original plan ‘

:

ed the Orientation Committee’s plan

in.‘ favor of postponing the camp one week. “Freshman camp will not be cancelled,” Dr. Wil-
liam B. Crafts said after the meeting. “It will only ‘be postponed a week.”

The camp was postponed one week, ac cording to Crafts, because it would not be
well attended by students or faculty during the Labor Day weekend. “We should get more
students the following weekend, though," Crafts said. j .

The Committee had decided that fresh man camp was not a worthwhile activity, and

that it conflicted withthe rest of the orientation program. Because of this action, Michael s‘
Slutsky, last year’s camp chairman, took up a petition protesting the committee’s decision.

Student Government adopted
the idea last year. of an annual

Twelve papers have been re-

member noted, “We are not going
to give the awards out ‘if there

of the camp,” Dean Rush ex-‘
plained. “There is nothing

SG PresidentEarns Standing Ovation

r

1

By AL J AN EZIC

Tap Day activities came to a
thundering close last Thursday
evening as outgoing Student Gov-
ernment president Martin Landy
received a standing ovation after
delivering the student_address at
the Tap Day banquet. v

Approximately 275 invited stu-
dents and faculty and admini-
strative personnel attended the an-
nual affair in the Student Union
Ballroom. Prominent guests and
outstanding campus leaders were
recognized by toastmaster Charles
Gularson, who then introduced
Tap Day speaker Landy.

Landy stated that his address
would be a critical evaluation of
what he called “a special type of
student: the student leader,” lab-
eling him the gravest problem on
campus and adding: “It is hard
for me to accept the-fact that the
elite of one of the nation’s' top
universities is notlwhat I expect-
ed.”

Landy charged that a student
of worth “readily sees that stu-
.dent affairs are not for him”
and blamed the lack of worth-
while student leaders on preva-

" lent feeling that students spend

“their four years aiming for

ODK or Mortar Board."
He said: “Many in this room

' became ofﬁcers only for the title,”
and claimed that “many try to do
what will give them publicity,
purely for the sake of winning an
external award. How many elected
ofﬁcers do we have who do noth-
ing and how many sit in this room
with an impressive list of activi-
ties?”

Landy cited values as lacking
and continued: “We are concerned
'with ends and results, not means.
How many here believe that the

truly important thing is not what

this is, what is to be expected.

the Orientation Committee, said, “The committee decided the camp
‘wasn’t needed because of the orientation programs. The_ fact that
only 150 students attended the camp was also a part of the reason.”
But the committee was forced to change its plans in favor of
delaying the camp until the ﬁrst week of school rather than
Labor Day weekend. This plan was adopted after Dean Crafts
presented the views of student leaders. ”

Since the students felt the camp was necessary,” Turks explained,
“we decided to delay the camp until the ﬁrst weekend of school
rather than cancelling it competely.”

Druids

Protest

Another of the student leaders who protested the cancellation
of freshman camp was Joseph Seiger, President of Druids, men’s
leadership honorary. “Freshman camp is a very important part of the
_orientation process here at the University,” Seiger’charged in a letter
to Dean Crafts. He added that the camp “is a prime contributor to the
small amount of school spirit that does exist at Pitt. Removing fresh-
man camp from the orientation program would be a definite step in

{the wrong direction.” _
Slutsky further charged that

“The only criticisms. of" the camp

arise from no knowledge of the camp. Dean Rush‘ is totally un-

realistic on all men’s activities.”

“Cancellation of the camp wasn’t being -considered, anyway,”
Miss Rush said, “The whole thing grew out of a misunderstanding.”

Another reason given for the proposed cancellation of the fresh-
. man camp was the YMCA’s association with the program. “If we give
the YMCA a program, we would be obligated to provide similar func-
tions for other sectarian groups,” Miss Rush explained.

Circle K and Men’s Dorm Council have already volunteered their.
services to ﬁll thevoid left by the YMCA, which is no longer directly

aﬂiliated with the University.

In addition, the Kiwanians have offered to help in the orientation

sessions during the summer.

.To correct the situation, Landy’

claimed: “We must create . . . a
real person  . distinct from all
others,” with values and who acts
not because he “thinks he must
but because he wants to.

“We must have people who
instead of being driven by self-
interest, motivated by glory, and

— governed by expediency, must

have more universal concerns,
must have self integrity, and
must be ethical}?

Citing examples of hate and
prejudice on campus, Landy quer-
ied that if this is the case at a
school where future leaders are

produced, “what hope is there for

our society?”

To create real leaders, he pro-
posed two methods: guidance and
example, adding: “The ‘University
must serve as a guideand student
leaders must become examples.”
Landy noted his own case where,
he said, “. . . largely due to one
member of the administration for
whom lworked . . . I developed a
commitment to principle and an
adherence to values. When we use
extra-curricular activities as edu-
cational we are participating in the
process.” He remarkedthat stu-
dent leaders can serve as examples
by their actions in showing‘ con-.
cern for values and, means and
thereby cultivating a crop of lead-
ers in the underclassmen.

Said Landy: “Once we address
ourselves to improving the moral-
ity of our school instead of fur-
thering our own ‘personal glory,
then and only then will we begin
to move forward, to achieve some-
thing worthwhile, and to con-
tribute to the well being of our
society."

University Theatre,
  Pitt Players Score
Smash With Farce

"‘A House With Two Doors is
piﬂicult to Guard” was an en-
tertaining divertissement with one

of the most talented casts that
has ever performed on the stage
of the Stephen.Foster Memorial.
I can only speak from three and
a half years experience in watch-
ing the University Theatre-Pitt
Players perform but there is no
question in my mind that the
ten individuals in the Calderon-
Kenneth Muir farce seemed to en-
joy performing in this instance
more than in any other produc-
tion that I’ve seen. The audiences
who were fortunate enough to
see a performance of “House”
were rewarded with an enter-
taining and enjoyable evening.

Director Ralph G. Allen of the
Speech Department is the man to
be congratulated for moving this
ﬁne cast of performers around
the stage with great ease.’ and
agility while maintaining a good
deal of robustness and energy.
Set in seventeenth century Spain,
the plot concerns people. in love.
The many ridiculous situations
which «arise to complicate matters

keep things moving. The- two sets.

of lovers are assisted by an. as-
sorted collection of maids, ser-

vants, and relatives all adding to.

the confusion and entertainment.

It’ is very difficult to evaluate
the acting in any farce since the
rule of the day -is one of con-
stant mugging, upstaging, and
non-Kosherin-g (that is, hamming
it up). But I will take the occa-
sion to single out everyone as
doing yeoman work and wonder-
ful “acting” jobs. Sondra Schren-
ker and ‘James Berry as one set
of lovers, and Barbara Lyon and

Frank, Maraden as the other set

were e q u a l l y delightful and

spirited in their performances. A.
Richard Coakley as" Fabio played
to the hilt the bumbling yet con-
cerned father.

The other ﬁve individuals of
the cast should be dealt with on
a different level since their ac-
complishments included that of

a wild and wooly prologue be-
fore each act. Linda Citron,
Wandalie Henshaw, Jim Chap-
man, Larry Heller and John Peck
played roles in the comedy but
it was as a group of madcap per-
formers" in the prologue which
produced the most~—hi1arious mo-
ments of the evening. Miss Hen-
shaw and Miss Citron took every
advantage of the audience and
dominated the hilarity. Their
facial gestures and their cynical
comments were perfect give and
takes and they were greatly
helped by the men.

As in. most~‘University. Theatre
productions, a new innovation
was tried. With the production of
“Houseiwith Two Doors,” a re-
volving stage, designed by Philip
R. Eck and‘his' very able staff,
was used for the_ﬁrst time and
it was an immense success.‘ The
atmosphere of a Broadway pres-
entation was achieved with this
set and stage operation. All are to
be applauded for their imagina-
‘tive creation. Inlike manner, the
Spanish costumes were colorful
and a deﬁnite asset“.

In the ﬁnal rundown, the per-
son to be given the laurel is Dr.
'Allen, who, along with Harvey‘
Miller and Henniger Winstead,
helped to create the lively, robust,
‘and highly amusing atmosphere.
He set the pace for the ten prin-
cipals and it was a performance
I shall long remember.

The Gravy Tram
Without a doubt the single biggest factor preventing

stiidents from attending school the third term is a simple
lack of the necessary funds. Contrary to the opinion of a

 
 

‘ great majority of people‘ in this city and of some here on

campus, this University is not a playground for‘ millionaires’

I " sons. A few, yes, but not that many. Acocrding to the Chan-

cellor the average income of families sending students to

' this institution is approximately $7,500 per year. Not the
carriage trade by any means, quipped Dr.'Litchﬁeld during

a recent debate. . _

Well, if that be the case, and if the schedule of courses
for the spring term has been bolstered with more classes and
better professors, and if the University has available an al-
most unlimited amount of funds for student loans, and if the
quantity of student activities is going to be increased over 50
per cent, then we cannot think of a single reason why stu-
dents will not want to get in on all this gravy.

Again we urge as many as possible to check up on the
resources being made available for the spring term this year.
To miss out on it could_ be a big mistake.

A Formal A ttempt

Unlike Northwestern University,'where you have to be
Greek to do anything, the Universityof Pittsburgh is in the
comfortable position of option — fraternity is a personal

-matter and you don’t need its backing to succeed.

The Greeks have been criticized for their weakness, due A
in part to the fact that afﬁliation is not “required.” But it is

_ often overlooked that they are performing their named pur-
pose at this institution —— that of a social fraternity. . '

And in this purpose they have secured their leadership
position.

i This year, the fraternal system has extended its annual
Greek Week festivities into ﬁve days‘ of planned activity, in-
cluding, for the ﬁrst time in a long while at the University,
a formal dance._ ‘ ' I

They have, in a sense, assumed the responsibility of

' bringing back the social spirit of the Spring Carnival and

class dances which were lost in the conﬂicts of the trimester
system. They have taken as well the initiative of intro-
ducing the national trend of tux and ﬂoor-length dresses
into an essentially sports jacket and knit suit school.

This week should be a crystallization of their successful
leadership in the social realm. J.G.

“H The Tap ‘Day Address . : : P

Leader Or Martyr?

In the relatively short time that has
elapsed since Thursday’s Tap Day, a num-
ber of people who witnessed Marty Landy’s
address at the Tap Day dinner. have- ap-
proached either me or one
of my friends and have re-
marked that Marty sure
“gave it to me” in his .
speech. - ‘

This is onlyhalf true. .

True, Marty “gave it to
me,” and I don’t believe 9
that I am being too con-
ceited to assume that my- 
self along with Pete Bijur,
Joe Seiger, and a number
of other were the ones at K
which his speech was really directed, for I
sincerely believe that Marty believes that
we are just the sort of people so eloquently
criticized in his talk. He did not, however,
give me anything which Ilhad not expected

 

to receive. Many people were impressed ‘

with [his ideas but had they watched his
progress all year they would have -known,
that he was not saying anything -new. His
speech was simply an expression of those
principles by which he attempted to run
Student Government._ It is impossible to
discuss his. speech without. recognizing this
fact. Marty Landy is the epitome of the
leader which he believes the‘ Universit
should produce. - _ . , ' ’
I do not believe in this at all.
_ Marty Landy is an idealist. He stated

this fact many times during his speech.’ He‘

also 'believes that a‘ leader. _should be an
idealist with a set of moral principles to

which he strictly adheres. He said “that the ~

test of a leader lies not in what he_accom-
plishes, but in why he accomplishes .it, how
he accomplishes it, and- foremost what he
is.” In short, Marty Landy would much

rather be a Woodrow Wilson than ‘a
Franklin Roosevelt. -

This -is very ﬁne for a political scientist
or for a professor. It is naive thinking, how-
ever, for anyone who seriously desires to
improve the situation of mankind. Landy
said that ,“the man I admire is an idealist
because he realizes man can progress. His
idealism enables him to-conceive the road
on which man will rnove,'and his dedica-
tion and determination enable him to build
that road.” ‘v

This is all very" ﬁne. ' Unless,»however, ‘

this idealistcan take the masses with him
down that road then he is not a leader.
Franklin‘ Roosevelt succeeded in this line
where Woodrow Wilson just couldn’t make
the grade. _ - ,
The reason why pure idealism fails_in
so many instances must be traced to its
source. Landy claims that man is ration-
al, educable and inherently good. Were
this so, thenthe idealists would_ have an
easy time of it, but they do not. I am a
pessimist by nature. I do not trust man,
and I. have stated this many times and
in tmany different ways in this news-
paper. I see no reason to change my mind
now. Man'is still an animal who must be
goaded into bettering himself. In many
instances he is "too irrational even to be
goaded and must be led like a blind man
or forced like a criminal to advance. The
common man is not impressed, by the
person with a moral principle to expound,
and we must’ all appreciate the fact that
it is the common man who must be help-
ed. The true leader can do this, the ideal-
istic man not necessarily.

Take Adolf Hitler for example. Why
did he succeed where the idealistic groups
of Germany failed? He succeeded because
—- whether we like to believe it or not —
he was one of history’s greatest leaders.
He possessed an ideology on which he based
his politics but he did not permit it to bind
his actions. The fact that he lead his country
to disaster is not as important —_ in this
discussion — as the fact that the idealists

By Matthew Swetonic

emerged from the struggle with clean hands
and fled the country when the Nazis took
power but is this enough?

Marty Landy would have us believe that
it is. I assert that it is not. Morally they
were superior to. Hitler and his Nazis.
They were not, however, able to carry the
masses with them and in the end all their
idealism and all their morality wasn’t
worth a thing.

Therefore, to claim as Landy does, that
aims are never as important as the means
is ridiculous. To fail is not as important as
having worked in a moral manner, is a
principle exponded only by those who have
lost touch with the ‘true purpose of a
leader — to lead. Whether he leads them to
good or to evil depends upon his own prin-
ciples, but he must have them first before
he can do a thing with them. Unless the
idealist realizes this simple point, he will
never be a leader.

The image Marty Landy presented as
a leader was in reality only that of a
martyr or at best a tragic hero. To live
by principle, act by principle, and fail in
the end is not admirable, it is just plain
foolish. Especially when the desired end-
might have been reached by less idealis-
tic means. ’

Landy, however, refuses to acknowledge
any ideals except those to which he adheres,
and he considers them rather inﬂexible. He
haswhat he has often referred to as a—“com-
mitment to democracy and to a Christian-
ethic.” The ﬁrst declares thatthe people are
ﬁt to rule and the second has as its basic
tenet the Golden Rule. I, for one, have
no commitment to democracy. lam not so
sure that it is the best system at all, but
does this make me unidealistic? I think not.
The same is true of the,Christian ethic. If
the welfare of the people demands "that a
person be destroyed then I will kill him’ and
with no regret. Does this make me a savage?
I think not. My principles may be different

than Marty Landy’s, but does that make me ’

any the less admirable? _

Marty Landy seems to have a set of
principles under which-he works for the
betterment of _mankind'. I look upon the

V betterment of mankind as a principle in it-

self and am not particularly concerned with
the morality of the mechanics under which
this betterment is to be accomplished.

I do, however, recognize the need for
Marty Landy never has.
believes that idealism will carry the ball
for him. This is simply not‘ so. The true
leader must understand the mechanics of
his trade as well as the principle or ideal
which must direct those ‘mechanics. In
many cases, there is a certain morality for
mechanics. Journalism has a certain ethical

code as well as politics. Marty appears un- ,
able to comprehend this simple fact, or else

believes this moral code much loftier_ than it
actually is. ‘ _  '
Nor does he seem to understand the
reasons why a person desires to become a
leader. He believes‘ that unless a person

is inspired by the same moral principles

which direct his action, then that person '

is a glory seeker, a mere collector of
awards. I should like to know upon what
grounds ﬁhe bases this assumption.

Marty quoted the end of Walden in
which Thoreau advised man to follow .a dif-'
ferent drummer, but he neglected that sec-
tion of Civil Disobedience in which the

same author declares that principle without‘,

action is not enough.

Man cannot live on principle alone; in

order to advance he must ﬁnd the means to
achieve his ends. The serpent and the dove
must work together. Principle and reality
must go hand in hand. If the means is not

_as ‘moral as the end, then I claim the mor-

ality of the means must be subordinated to
the morality of the end. To fail is just to
fail. To hide behind principle and morality
is self-deception.

The moral and idealistic person certain-
ly deserves his place among the ranks of
the leaders, but only if he has the practical
sense not to let his idealism take the place

cant positions. Dr. William C.

/Frederick has been named dean

 

of th e University’s Graduate
School of Business, and Dr. Bert-

ram S. Kraus, research coordinator

and director of the Cleft Palate
Research Center.

Dr. Frederick joined the Busi-
ness School faculty this past Sep-
tember as associate dean, and
since January 1 has served as act-
ing dean. He was clean of the Uni-
versity of Kansas City’s School of
Business Administration for the
three preceding years.

A native of Arkansas, he holds
two degrees from the University of
Texas —— Bachelor of Arts, with
honors, and Doctor of Philosophy,

‘ both in economics.

Dental Genetics
Dr. Kraus, an anthropologist
noted for his contributions to
dental genetics, will also hold an
appointment as professor of an-
atomy in the School of Dentistry.

thropology at the University, of
Washington since 1957, he was’
previously associated with the
University of Arizona. He holds
a Ph.D. and an M.A. from the
University of Chicago, and a
bachelor’s degree from Western
Reserve University.

The Cleft Palate Research Cen-
ter, which he will head, was esta-
blished inlate 1962. A variety of

disciplines, including dentistry,"

plastic surgery, speech pathology,
embryology, anatomy, genetics,
and epidemiology, are involved_ in

the research.

 

Model Curriculum Project Created

Continuous

  
 

  

Education

Program Mapped Out

Collaboration of educators from the University and
Pittsburgh’s public school system has made headway in
the creation of a project termed the “most comprehensive
curriculum revision project” in the nation.

The Pittsburgh Curriculum Continuity Demonstration,
as it is known, calls for a continuous program of study in

English, mathematics, science, so-9

cial studies, and foreign languages
from kindergarten into college.
The curriculum project has a
double aim: to design and put
into practice model curricula, in
the ﬁve subjects for students con-
sidered college material, and to
set the precedent for future school
and University collaboration. The
curricula haveb, een tested in
Schenley High School and are in
operation in other city schools.
Frick Elementary School is the
site of the testing of the element-
ary social studies curriculum.
More Comprehensive

The project is more comprehen-‘

sive than others of a similar na-
ture in that there are no gaps or
repetition in subject matter from
grade to grade, and the subjects
are inter-"related. V
“We try not to stress grade
levels in order that students will
move ahead as quickly as they

are able,” explains Dr. J. Steele ,

Gow, Jr., director of this proj-
ect and the University’s newly-
established Learning Researcli,
and Developmentcenter.

The ﬂexibility of the new cur-

riculum program is almajor ad-V '

vantage since th e traditional
grade—by-grade system ' prevents
progress to the next subject if it is
considered part of the next .grade’s
work. ’ . -
0 Fast Progression

By “un—grading” the material
for study under the'"proj'ect, stu-
dents can progress as fast as their

ability permits. Fast learners may
enter college a year earlier.

Five years old, the project is
jointly ﬁnanced by the University,
the city, and foundations such as
the Buhl and Ford Foundations.

, Four years ago coaches here
brought in a group of athletes that
will not soon, if ever, be ‘equaled
for ‘ability. Included in the 1960
class were such stars as Paul
Martha, Rick Leeson, Brian Gen-

,eralovich, Cal Sheffield and Rob
and Ron Levine.

The ﬁrst four mentioned already
rank as- among the greatest to play
in their respective sports here. The
Levine twins, however, are not

- A among the greatest, they are -the

greatest.

That’s the opinion to the man
who should know — Ben Grady.
Grady has been swimming coach
here since 1939. He states, rather
matter-of-factly, that “Robert and

Ronald are by far the two most-

outstanding swimmers we’ve ever
had.”

Anyone who knows Grady, or
who has followed Pitt swimming
for the last three years knows that
this'is not idle praise. The records
speak for this.

In a sport where records are as
common as crabgrass, the Levines
have still managed to set more than
most. Rob owns seven _Panther
records and Ron has four.

Rob holds school marks in the
100 and 200-yard back stroke, the
200, 500 and 1650-yard free style
and is a member of the school’s
record breaking free style and
medley relay teams. Ron holds Pitt
marks in the 200-yard individual
‘medley, the 100 and 200-yard but-
terﬂy and is also a member of the
record—holding medley relay teams.

Delta Sigma Phi, after being down by 11 points at the end of
the third quarter, came back to score a 56-47 overtime victory over

Sigma Chi Monday to win the Fraternity A League basketball cham-
pionship. Delta Sig, with Andy Alex scoring 4 points, outscored Sigma

Chi 8-3 in the ﬁve minute. overtime.

. Despite /the loss, Sigma Chi dominated the game until the fourth
‘quarter. Fine defensive work by Norm Himes and Jock Beachler of

Sigma Chi held John Pignetti to¢

ord for 40 minutes. He won the
ﬁrst heat of that event last year
in the NCAA championships and
since it was the ﬁrst time the event
was swum, it stood as the record,
until it was broken-in a later heat.

' But Levine got a plaque stating his

accomplishment. It hangs in

;torced Delta Sig to shoot inside
where they were hampered for
three quarters by Sigma Chi’s

Although Dan Picciano sparked
Sigma Chi by grabbing rebounds
and scoring 23 points, it was not
enough to overcome the Delta
Gigs’ fourth quarter surge. Delta

overcome an 11 point deficit and

Campus radio station WPGH
was unable to broadcast last
Saturday’s Pitt - Penn S t a t e
basketball game because they
were not given space at Uni-

VVPGH sports director Barry
Weiser said he contacted State

there was none available. When
Weiser replied that Bell Tele-
phone would set up an instal-

good. According to Weiser, Tar-
man’s reply was, “Apparently
you didn’t hear me, I said there
was no room.” _ -

Pitt publicist Beano Cook

As of Monday eight of the 12 positions had been ﬁlled. Along
with Pitt and Duquesne, Army, New York University, St. Bona-
venture, DePaul, Miami and St. Joseph's have been selected.

At least one team, the second place ﬁnisher in the Missouri
Valley Conference, will be chosen. It is highly probable that the
third place team may also receive a bid. In the past the second
place team in the Skyline Conference has also received e bid.

The ﬁeld should be completed by tomorrow and the seeded
teams named- “If we don’t play until Saturday, I’ll probably give

the teams a‘ couple of more days’ rest. If we play Thursday, then
we’ll practice straight through,” said Timmons. .

It has been reported that the Panthers and Duquesne are in
different brackets in the NIT and would not meet until the finals. ' . '
There is a possibility that they could meet in a consolation game.

The Panthers ended the year with four players in double
ﬁgures led by Cal Sheﬂield’s 18.3. Brian Generalovich ﬁnished
with 16.7, Dave Sauer with 12 and Dave Roman with '11.

.Both Sheiﬁeld and Generalovich were honorable-mention
all-America on the United Press International’s team. Shefﬁeld
ended the year with 439 points and Generalovich with 401.

“Only Sheﬁ'ie1d.and Generalovich played good ball against
Penn_ State‘ on Saturday," said Timmons. “We have been playing
good ball since we were picked for the NIT. I hope we can con-
tinue it once we get to New York,” he added.

year’s Easterns Ron took a third
in the butterﬂy and Rob finished in
the same position in the back-
stroke. f

Grady won’t comment on their
chances of improving this season.
“There are-’more, than 40 teams
entered in the meet and you never
know who some of the schools
have. You might know about the
juniors and seniors, butthere are

y vacation the Panther basketball team‘ re-
sumes practice today in preparation for the NIT which begins
that Pitt will play either Thursday

If one of the Levines can win an
Eastern title it will be the culmina-
tion of a career which began rather
late as far as swimmers are con-
cerned.

Rob said, “We don’t really ‘get
interested in swimming until we
Were sophomores in high school.”

According to Grady this late
start has been more a help than a
hindrance. “A lot of swimmers get
started at a very early age and lose
some of their desire by the time
they hit college,” he said. “But
these two haven’t lost any of their
desire and I think part of the rea-
son can be traced to their late
start.” '

The Levines got their swimming’

start at the nearby YMHA where
Jack Morris was their coach. They
got most of their training from his
successor, Dick Bower, who is now
a highly successful high school
coach at Bethel.

They swam’ for S.chenley High

‘ School, also here in Oakland, where

Rob won the state back stroke
championship and Ron took a
seventh in the butterﬂy.

Because of their showings Rob»

received numerous college offers
and Ron only a few. Ron said, “We
decided to come to Pitt because
we wanted to stick together and be-
cause of this fantastic pool.”

The pool haslushered in a new
swimming. Grady
hopes it will be the enticement to
bring some of the top high school
swim stars of the area to Pitt. But
as far as he’s concerned there is

_ little chance of_ getting anyone to

compare with the Levine twins.

By FRANK SMIZIK

It is easier to face a 250-
pound wrestler or a 250-pound
football tackle? Heavyweight
wrestlers Bill Beck and Bill
Bodle, if given their A chance,
would rather be- out on the grid-
iron than facing the big heavy-
weights on the mat.

“The difference is that I know
what I would do against the big

‘tackle, but I’m not always sure

against the wrestler,” said Beck.
Bodle thought along the same
lines for they both are inexperi-
enced grapplers. “It’s impossible
to act quickly in wrestling unless
you’re sure of yourself, and that
doesn’t start until you’ve been
wrestling a lot longer than I
have,” Bodle said. .
Bodle and Beck are halfbacks
on the football team who used
to frequent coach Rex Peery’s
wrestling room to keep in
shape in the off-season. “We

' used _to go down there and

Peery used to tease us about
putting us ' into matches,”
laughed Beck.

“When we decided to go out for
the team this year we didn’t think
we’d get much chance to wrestle,
but Bill Buchanan became in-
eligible and we were the only
ones around. We really took a
beating when starting because we
knew absolutely nothing.” ‘

Their composite record is a.not
too glorious 0-8, but they had
never wrestled before coming
here. “To be good you had to have
wrestled in high school,” said.
Beck. “However, some of the big
men I’ve faced didn’t seem to
know much more than I did.”

"I wrestled a really big clod up
at Army and I know he didn’t
know very much about the
skills. But he was big and strong
enough to just grab me around
the neck and keep me down.”

Bodle is the heavier of the two,
190 to 185 pounds, but both are
very light for the heavyweight di-
yision. They have given away as
much as sixtyipounds to an oppo-
nent. “I’m not any more afraid of
a bigger man than a smaller
man,” said Bodle. "I get butter-
ﬂies no matter who I meet.”

Beck’s weight has ﬁuctuated
between 178 and‘l85, but he says
he doesn’t mind meeting the
heavier man. “I know‘ I’m faster
than the bigger men, but when I
meet the men who are about my
size. I have 'more trouble.”

Beck‘ is probably the most
colorful of the Panther matmen

because of his humorous high

kick-type of escape. “A man
has. two choices, either to let go

or else to get kicked in the
face," Beck said. “Although I

' don't try to hurt the man on

purpose’ it has proved a very
successful way to get out of
trouble.”

Next season will be Beck and
Bodle’s last of competition, but
they both intend to Wrestle. “Ex-

perience is what we both lack-,”

said Bodle. “If we keep -at it long
enough we’ll be all right. It’s like
learning plays in football —— you
have to run them through until
they become like natural re-
ﬂexes.” B - ’

'Easy life’ Makes
Star’: lite Easier

Jean Louis Trintignant‘ plays ’a
serious young student in “The
Easy Life,” in which he stars with
Vittorio Gassman and Catheruie
Spaak. The comedy drama, ﬁlmed
in Rome and along the Italian
Riviera, now at the Guild Theatre.

Since his motion picture debut
in a ﬁlm short in 1956, Jean Louis
Trintignant has become one of the

fastest-rising young stars on the

international scene with over a
dozen top ﬁlms to his credit. His
portrayal of a serious student in
Joseph E. Levine’s “The Easy
Life,” has already resulted in crit-
ical acclaim here and abroad and
won for the sensitive young actor
a new legion of enthusiasts.

Just prior to starring in “The
Easy Life,” Trintignant starred in
France with Brigitte Bardot in
“And God Created Woman” —- a
box office smash hit the world
over. Often cast in such shy, timid
or reserved roles, he had always
hoped to take on the part of a
stronger, more overtly forceful
character.

After TrintIgnant’s success in
“The Easy Life,” he was ﬁnally
offered the opportunity to play
this kind of role. Roger Vadim,
producer of “And God Created
Woman,” was again tremendously
impressed with the depth of Trin-
tig'nant’s performance in “The
Easy Life,” and has asked him to

play in the screen version of
Francoise Sagan’s “Castle In
Sweden."
