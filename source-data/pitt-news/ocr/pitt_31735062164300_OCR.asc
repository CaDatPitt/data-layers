Johnson, Goldwater, Anti—Goldwater Student ’

Organizations Recruit Campaign

By ALEX D’IPPOLl’l‘0

With the national campaign in
high gear, three student organiza-
tions are actively participating on be-
half of the two major parties. One of these
groups supports President Johnson and one
supports Senator Goldwater. The third
group unites, not for Johnson, but against
Goldwater.

The Young Citizens for Johnson and
Humphrey “wants to show the local com-
munity that the students are overwhelm-
ingly for Johnson,” said Nathan Firestone,
coordinator of the group at the ﬁve area
colleges and junior colleges. The ‘Univer-
sity’s chapter is headed by senior political
science major Allan Schlosser. Firestone is
a Ph.D. candidate in the Graduate School
of Public and International Affairs.

“Now is the time for collegestudents
to get involved in public affairs,” Firestone
asserted. “This is the most crucial election
in the century. The voters are given a
choice, not an echo.”

Why Johnson?

In explaining why students support

Johnson, he asked, “Do college students

want to see the continuation of rational,’

strong, enlightened foreign policy and a
domestic policy in orderly progress as rep-
resented by the Kennedy-Johnson adminis-
tration; or do they want to see a reckless
foreign policy in which nuclear weapons
become conventional, and a regression in
domestic progress — particularly civil
rights?” _ .

I The Young Citizens intend to deprec-

and attending rallies. “No person should

think that working for 9, candidate is _

menial,” stresses Firestone, who helped
‘ candidate John F. Kennedy in 1960. ’

But Bill Valentine and his group of
Young Republicans (YR) are in disagree-
ment with Firestone’s analysis of political
events. Valentine, who is president of the
group, said he and his organization are be-
hind Senator Goldwater and the entire
Republican ticket in order to achieve “a
sound private economy,_ maximum freedom

as possible with the local Republican
campaign organization.” They hope to
translate support for Goldwater and the
entire GOP ticket into practical work for

.. V the party.

“We are not starting a separate Gold-
water organization,” Valentine explained,
“because we already have an existing or-
ganization and we do not want to duplicate

. efforts.”

All GOP Welcome.

“We have room in our group for Gold- ‘ 
water supporters, Hugh Scott supporters, 
and anyone who wishes to work for any -  if
part of the Republican ticket—regardless  

of party affiliation,” Valentine stated.
The third group, an ad hoc commit-‘

tee headed by bacteriology major Rog-. 1
er Weppelman, is a small body of “en- "A

thusiastic volunteers”
selves “Students against Goldwater.”

The group is composed of independent : ,
undergraduates who “consider Goldwater,
somewhat of a threat . . . especially in for-'

eign policy and. social welfare.”
Education Planned
They hope to keep voters from marking

their ballots for Goldwater by discrediting‘ a
his policies with campaign materials and;

literature.
Certainly with the range. of political

stands represented by these three organiza-v I

tions, the students, like the voters whom
Firestone discusses, “are given a choice,
not an echo.” It remains only to- ask if,

 Se

Out of the freshmen men who went fraternity this week you could count on

  your toes the number who had time to weigh the decision seriously.

From the kick-off smoker two weeks ago, when many of the freshmen didn’t
even have their invoices yet, the rush was on —-the tea dances, the jammies, the car

_  caravans, the luncheons, the double dates, the wooing, the snowing. All of this, to be
,;:j;  sure, is part of the traditional Greek induction and is most flattering to the rushees
' ‘7 and spiriting for the brothers, but by the same token that list of fall pledges must be

-"seen as a bandwagon. It is not an indication of true fraternity interest, because these

freshmen have not had enough experience at this University to choose fraternity life.

" . . They had not had time to examine an identity as a member of a Student Government

committee or Men’s Glee .Club. They had no time just to examine their identity as

independents.

A decidedly more rational approach is deferred freshman rush, the system used

‘ by sororities on this campus, where there are hands-off signs until January. There

is a Panhel Preview to acquaint freshmen with the facts about sorority; freshmen
mentors and senior assistants are primed with information -about the Greeks so that

_ it they can answer questions. But no formal snow is allowed until the second term
 after the women have had some time to ﬁnd themselves at the University.

The stock reason for the men having a September rush is ﬁnancial: they say
they cannot operate socially during the fall term without the pledges’ dues. But if
they waited to rush until January they could budget their funds for the following

 7, fall; the overlap of the ﬁrst year might be rough but certainly not impossible.

University fraternities indicated their recognition of responsibility when their

 scholastic average topped the all men’s QPA last winter and when they recently es-

tablished the Interfraternity Loan and Scholarship Fund for deserving students. They

i certainly realize that since the Greek system is not all-powerful on this campus they

must show thought in their actions. Snowing wide-eyed freshmen before they know
the whole campus story does not mean that these boys are going to keep up a blind
fascination for the ‘group. If the Greeks -are looking for strength it’s forethought
not emotion that ﬁnally wins out. ‘

‘ scure and sin-
— gularly un-
 di'stinguished
congressman
from upstate
New York,
has been cast
into the role
of Goldwat-
er's Sancho
Panza.
Bill Miller’s reputation is

 

Schlosser

S attributable not to legisla-

tive accomplshment or lead-
ership, but rather to his
unique style of political
campaigning, which has
earned him the unenviable
label of “gut fighter” among
both Republicans and Demo-
crats alike. Indeed, Senator
Goldwater delights in tell-
ing - members of the press
corps that he selected Mil-
ler because the latter
“drives Lyndon Johnson
nuts.” This may be a tacti-
cal asset, but it is most as-
suredly not a qualification
for the vice-presidency of
the United States.

WHATEVER the ration-
ale underlying the selection
of Miller might have been-
his Catholicism, geographi-
cal balance, his conserva-
tism — one can be certain
that the choice was not bas-
ed upon the quality of his
record in the Congress.
Guilty of shocking absen-

_teeism, Miller’s most sig-

niﬁcant contributions to

_- American legislative history

have been to sponsor the in-

if  -corporations of the “Moms

of America” and a higher

; tariff on imported bread.‘

fp__I_n_ -1956; Miller, who was

   

-agreed ’tl:iat*" the Minnes

originally on record as be-
ing a sponsor of an Eisen-
hower civil rights bill, ex-
perienced an eleventh-is 
change of heart abor-
constitutionality of the .
sure. This dramatic reversal
was, however, a calculated
gesture to Chairman How-
ard Smith of the Rules Com-
mittee, who duly agreed to
pigeonhole the pending pub-
l1c power legislation for the
Niagara Falls area, which
is in Miller’s district. -
Miller’s political oratory
is demagogicand has on oc-
casion approached character
assassination. In a Labor
Day speech to workers in
South Bend, Ind., Miller
-‘warned that the Johnson
Administration's immigra-
tion policy “would open the
floodgates for any and all
who would wish to_ come and
ﬁnd work in this country
. . . These people will need

jobs, but where will they-

ﬁnd them? Are you willing
to give them yours?”

IN THE SELECTION of
William Miller as its vice-
presidential nominee, the
Grand Old Party has not
only betrayed reason but
has abdicated its national
responsibility. Bearing in
mind the unpleasant histor-
ical fact that four Ameri-
can presidents in the 20th
Century—McKinley, Hard-
ing, Roosevelt, and Kenne-.
dy-—have been unable, for
reasons natural and unna-
tural, to complete their
terms of office, it is a
frightening prospect that
William Miller, if elected,
would be in a position to in-
herit the presidency of the
United‘ States.

One may have deep dif-
ference of opinion with the
liberalism of Hubert Hum-
phrey.‘ but it is'g¢T1..S31.'.§113’

  * on

 

  
    

senator, since coming to
the Senate some sixteen
years ago, .has been an ar-
ticulate, creative, and ener-
getic figure in American
public life.

As the author of the Peace
Corps legislation and the
nuclear test-ban treaty, as
a vigorous advocate of Fed-
eral aid to education and

urban renewal, and as the

ﬂoor manager of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, major-
ity whip Humphrey has
earned the admiration and
respect of his political
friends and foes alike. He
has demonstrated leader-
ship traits which cannot be
found in his Republican ad-
versary.

UNBURDENED by con-
siderations of Miller’s com-
petence for our second high-
est office,‘ Goldwater and
his faithful squire gallop
across the nation in search
of windmills. They seek to
establish a more direct link
between President Johnson
and Bobby Baker; they
taunt Senator Humphrey
for his long-standing affil-

‘liation with that secret and

conspiratorial society, the
Americans for Democratic
Action; they demand “total
victory” in our foreign re-
lations; and they promise
that if elected the federal
government will see to it
that legal law enforcement
is restored throughout the
land (a pledge which usual-
ly follows the reaffirmation
of states rights).

As American public opin-
ion begins to stabilize at
two-to-one in favor of’ the
Johnson - Humphrey ticket,
one can only speculate as to

what these jolly crusaders

will resort to, in despera-

;._.tion,. during_ -the crucial

Letters To

Students Want

Information

Editor, The Pitt News:

After all the administrative
sound and fury over the increase
in intellectualism among Pitt’s
student body, it’s about time
someone attended to the prob-
lems which accompany this aca-
demic blossoming. A good place
to start is on the distribution of
graduate fellowship information.

Pitt's student body has, hope-
fully, long since passed the stage
where requests for data on na-
tional fellowships should come as
a surprise to anyone. Yet recent-
‘ly potential competitors for Ful-
brights, Danforths, Wilsons, etc.,
have been shunted from office
to office, secretary to secretary,
bureaucrat to bureaucrat, in
search of information about and
applications for these programs.

The recent shifting of adminis-
trative personnel responsible for
these fellowship programs is a
lame excuse for so gross a weak-,
ness in this area. Such ineptitude
is depriving the University of a
valuable asset in her climb to
academic status; what is worse,
it may deprive deserving students
of opportunities for intellectual
fulﬁllment. We suggest that the
responsible committee (there
must be one) take immediate ac-
tion to provide information, ap-

. plications, and publicity on these

fellowship programs before it is
too late. Due date for Fulbrights
is October 15.

Need for Trash
Cans Cited By
Irate Student

Editor, The Pitt News

It was about time that some-
one brought to the attention of
the University and the city of
Pittsburgh, the need for litter
recepticals along each corner of
the campus,

I was annoyed to- learn that
there are no litter baskets at all
near the Cathedral of Learning,
the men’s dorms, Clapp Hall and
the rest of the commonly used
buildings. '

Being a civic-minded citizen, I
held my scrap of paper from
Clapp Hall until I reached an ash
tray inside the men’s dorm. At
the same time I was holding this
paper, I was thinking to myself,
how many others do this same
thing.

Knowing the human individual,
he is apt to throw his litter onto
the street, and consequently cause
de-beautifying effects on the area,

the campus and the city of Pitts,

burgh.

As a native New Yorker, I
would hate to see Pittsburgh end
up a cluttered mess of litter, as
the streets of New York have
become. Thus, I strongly urge the
city and the University to take
some action on this matter and
supply the grounds with the nec-
essary recepticles.

With It   ’

 By Marvin Zelkovvitz

FRANK MERRIWELL could not have won Saturday's
football game with Oregon. It takes a certain amount of
luck to win a football game, and the Panthers’ luck
ran out when they lost the coin toss to UCLA three

weeks ago.

Once again, the team has a following of frustrat-
ed football fans. It’s just like three years ago, or four
years ago, or ﬁve years ago, or six years . . .

COACH JOHN Michelosen still has a great backfield on
his ﬁrst unit. Catch these statistics for the Oregon game.
' Dale Stewart; seven carries for 28 yards. Barry Mc-
Knight: 16 carries fo 68 yards. Eric Crabtree: four

carries for 19 yards. Jim

26 yards. No back was held to less than four yards A

per carry.

Flanigan: four carries for

The Panther defensive line held-the Oregon ground

gainers to just 72 yards in

35 carries. If they can hold

that well against William and Mary, West Virginia,
and Miami, they can still goginto the Navy game with
a 3-2 record. But the Panthers still need luck. So far,

they haven’t had any.

FRED MAZUREK, the Panthers’ ace quarterback, has
been selected as an all-American prospect by the Ameri-
can Football Coaches Association poll. His selection
was announced in the September 26 issue of TV Guide
magazine. Navy’s Roger Staubach heads the list of

eligibles for the honor.

As of now however, in the total offense race
Mazurek’s total yardage mark for 2 games is close to

390. At that rate, he’l1 top

Staubach’s 1,892 yards that

earned the Navy quarterback the Heismann Trophy.

‘ We liked the idea of coach Michelosen leaving
Mazurek in the game to run both offensive units.
Kenny Lucas is a capable quarterback, ‘but to Win a
football game, you have to go with the best you have

for as long as you have it.

That means using Mazurek

on offense as much -as possible. It might also mean

winning football.

IN ADDITION to being a glum day for the football team,
Saturday was also a glum day for the soccer team. They

played the West Chester Rams, one of the top soccer ..

teams in the country. Twice West Chester took the
lead, and twice the Panthers ‘came back to tie the score.

Then, with only five minutes left to play in the
game, a West Chester lineman booted the ball 30 yards
in the general direction of the Panther goal.

TO STOP the ball, fullback Cal Bonawitz blocked the ball
with his hands. The illegal move gave the Rams a free
shot on goal which they promptly converted to a 3-2

victory.

_ Coach Leo l_3‘emis says that Bonawitz thought there
was a man behind him, but there was no one between

up the Panthers’ loss to Oregon
when he said, “We outplayed
them but we didn’t win, I have to
say they were a little luckier.”

The team seemed dejected, but
not down. They felt they had
played a good game and just lost
because the breaks didn’t go their
way. The statistics agree with
the Panthers even though the
score was against them.

fact Pitt’s total offense was a
total of 373 yards to 230 for
Oregon. The whole story of the
game is that the Panthers
could move the ball but not as
far as the goal line.

Something good did turn up
for the Panthers. Some players
showed Michelosen they can play
on the varsity. Michelosen’ was
especially pleased with Dennis

“Bush Play,” Says NCAA 

Bemis, Bonawitz Explain Loss

By BILL CABIN
In Saturday's soccer game, full-

—‘back Cal Bonawitz blocked a

shot from -the 30 yard line with
his hand, giving
‘West Chester
the penalty shot
they converted
into the winning
goal.
“It was a bush
play,” said Mel
Lorback, the

 

Bonawih coach and chair-
man’ of the district NCAA soccer
committee.

Bonawitz said, “It happened
so fast that I can't say for sure
why I did it. It’s just one of
those things I did on the spur
of the moment.”

Coach Leo Bemis said, “Ca1’s
man had him beaten and he
blocked a lead pass to a man who

West Chester-

was cutting in on a dead run
from the opposite side. They
hadn’t shown that they had an
effective shot; and I still feel that
it was a good calculated risk in
blocking the ball.”

“That type of tactic is com-
monly used by many German Na-
tional teams. In fact, last year
against one of the military acad-
emies, a German team did it per-
sistently. When the academy team
protested on grounds of unsports-
manlike conduct, nothing hap-
pened.”

Bemis, who stated earlier
that the play was a “good cal-
culated risk” then said that the
play was a mistake. “It was
iust one of many plays we made
as mistakes, and I don't think
it should be overemphasized. I
consider it as water over the
dam.”

 
     

The booters will face a similar
type of team this Saturday morn-
ing when theylplay Ohio Univer-
sity at Forbes Field. “They have
somewhat the same style as West
Chester with a short-pass game
and an agressive team. We should
be able to beat them neverthe-
less. The team's got to redeem
itself and do it convincingly.”
