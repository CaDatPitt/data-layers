Ex—p0lz'tz'cal prisoner
awaits German unity

By Rich Taylor
Staff Writer

As the concrete of the Berlin Wall is shattered, East and West
Germans impatiently await the democratic election in the
German Democratic Republic scheduled for March 18.

“The next step is the election," said Peter Bothig, a political
dissenter who ﬂed the jails of East Germany and is now living
in the United States. “Then the doors will be open for
unification.”

Bothi g, a literary historian, was imprisoned by the ST AZI, the
East German secret police, for taking part in an underground

which published works of poetry and other types of literature -

that were prohibited by the government.

Now a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh,
Bothig said he is not the only German who looks forward to
a uniﬁed Germany. “In the consciousness of the German,
especially the consciousness of the West German, the status of
Germany as one was always there."

Bothig said that the Germans still have fears, though.

“The East Germans fear that they will lose some of their social
security. The ‘West Germans fear that they have to share their
richness,” he said.

It is the prosperous economy of the West, Bothig believes,
that will save East Germany. “As far as I can judge,” Bothig said,

Stale suds and cold chicken...
‘Lousy’ luau lacks luster forbreakers

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

DAYTONA BEACH, FLA. —
The ﬂier promised them a luau
with an authentic Polynesian feast
and free drinks all night.
According to 23 Pitt spring
breakers, that luau turned out to
be a a cold piece of chicken and
lousy beer.

“We definitely got ripped off.
The ticket woman said it was
going to be a wonderful ti-me, but
it was horrible,” said senior Scott
Williams.

Williams and 22 other Pitt
students were given a ﬂier
picturing ﬁre dancers and huge
tables filled with exotic fruits.
Underneath the tantalizing
photos, the ﬂier promised free
drinks, a free collector’s mug and
a fantastic barbecue feast with
hula dancers, all for $20.

“The collector’s mug was

plastic. The big fruit salad was
canned fruit thrown into big vats.
It was really gross,” Williams said.

The luau was part of several
events sponsored by Inter-
Campus Programs. i

“As soon as we got to the hotel,
they gave us the packet of all the
side excursions. When they put
the luau right next to trips to
Disney and Epcot, you expect it
to be something special, but it
wasn’t,” said Sandy Richetti,
junior. ‘

Antje Eberle, freshman, said
that she was also disappointed
with the luau.

“The food was rained on. I.

couldn’t eat the salad because it
was swimming in water. It was
just a big joke,” she said.

Williams agreed.

“It was cold and raining. Instead
of moving us inside like they
should have, we had to stay
outside. The seats where we were

supposed to watch the so—called
entertainment were filled with
puddles," Williams said.
Admission to two local clubs,
The Great Barrier Reef and 701,
was included in the package, but
Williams said that when he tried

to gain entrance, he was told that '

he would have to wait until 11
p.m.

“Everyone in the group had the
same opinion: we’d been had. I
didn't come here with money to

just throw it away,” Williams

said.

During the luau, Williams
inquired about receiving a refund
and was told that his only option
was to try to sell his ticket to
another student for the next day's
luau.

“Rather than getting upset, I
decided to try to get in touch with
the program director, lStevenl
Cox, but he was nowhere to be

to sweep this thing under the
carpet, but we are not going to let
them forget about this," he said.

“The thing is that we got
shammed, and we should get
some sort of compensation I put
my trust in them. I don't know if
the [Pitt Program Council] had
anything to do with it, but I
assume that they should have to
approve these types ofprograms,'
Williams said.

Tom Misuraca, PPC adviser,
said that the PPC is not responsible
for any problems that students
may have with the side programs.

endorse what we control, and we
don't control that program," he
said. '

Afterseveral days Williams was
able to contact Cox and to work
out a deal to compensate the
students who had paid for the
luau. C

‘Cox provided us with press
passes that let us get into any bar
that we wanted to for the last two
nights. Now everyone seems
satisﬁed, and I am happy about
the way, things turned out,”
Williams said.

and von Ribbentrop, the foreign ministers of two of
history’s mostnotorious madmen, ofﬁcialized the Stalin-
Hitler Fact. The pact’s original intention was to commit a
pledge of nonagression between the Soviet Union and
Germany. That pledge was swiftly broken when the Nazis
invaded Russiaon June 22, 1941. An additional secret
protocol called for the two countries to divide conquered
Poland.

Yet as those two provisions have fallen into the dustbin
of history, one of the pact’s more devious, incompassion-
ate and selfish agreements has remained under Soviet
control. With the simple words “the territory of Lithuania
comes under the U.S.S.R. sphere of inﬂuence”-— and “the
government of the U.S.S.R. [is to take] special measures to
safeguard its interests on Lithuanian territory,” Hitler and
Stalin agreed to annex the nation of Lithuania to Soviet
dominance. This Sunday, the Lithuanian parliament voted
124 to O to break from the 50-year grip of Soviet

communism. P

But it appears as though independence from the Soviet
Union-will not come as easy for Lithuania as one might

. suspect in this era of glasnost. Mikhail Gorbachev, Time

magazine’s Man of the Decade, who once said thatany
attempt at independence by a Baltic nation would result
in “discord, bloodshed and death,” has expressed his

' disapproval of the move by demanding that Lithuania pay

the Soviet Union a price for succession, namely $34
billion in hard currency. _

It seems rather ridiculous that a country which —— thanks
to failed Soviet economic" policies and domination — is
too economically downtrodden to afford such" a fee;
should have to pay so much to a paternal Soviet leader-
ship that was forced upon it and has done nothing but
suppress its basic liberties, freedom and independence.
Additionally, the $34 billion request is outrageous given
that the Soviets took Lithuania without that nation’s
consent or approval (i.e., illegally), not to mention
through a decision between two of the. biggest mass
murderers ever to roam the earth.

However, the actual prospects for Lithuanian sover-
eignty could be worse; the nation does have -time and
circumstance on its side. Any previous Soviet leader
would have sent in the tanks to crush the first signs of
dissent in Lithuania. Such a situation occurred in 1956 in
Hungary, in 1968 in Czechoslovakia, and in the 1980s war
in Afghanistan. And even more noteworthy is that none
of these nations was a cherished Soviet republic, as is
Lithuania. But those invasions were during more eco-
nomically prosperous times for the Soviet Union. Now, in
this era when they need Western financial support, they
wouldn’t dare consider an invasion of Lithuania — which
would surely cut Gorbachev’s umbilical cord to the West.
Ironically, it’s a sign of the times that Lithuania only faces
a $34 billion fee.

The struggle for Lithuanian independence did not end
at this Sunday's parliament; it has only just begun. Keep
your eyes on all of the Soviet republics.

Orson ‘Welles revisited at WDUQ

"The Martians have landed .. . ”
— Orson Welles »

» "There will be no more jazz on
WDUQ. ”— A local radio person-
ality

Several generations ago, Orson
Welles provided proof of his
genius when he terrifically tricked
a nation of radio listeners into
thinking that there was a full-
scale alien invasion with his
infamous Warofthe World9broad-
cast. A few weeks ago, a local
radio personality made an unfor-
tunate ass of himself when he
terriﬁed local WDUQ fans into
thinking that there was a full-
scale removal of jazz from the
station's format.

‘ Of course, The War of the
Worlds phenomenon and
WDUQ’s recent Sunday broad-
cast can both be considered illus-
trations of irresponsibility with
regard to the sensitive medium of
radio. Radio as a medium is inti-
mate and personal; we would
generally want to feelthat what
we hearon it is factual, unless
explicitly pre-defined otherwise.
It is always cause for concern
when either radio or television is

used to mislead the public.

The “recent Sunday broadcast”
that this writer speaks of took
place on WDUQ a few weeks
ago: A local hostsigned olf for the
final time and declared, in conﬁ-
dence, that there would be no
more jazz on the station. He was

upset because he had dedicated

nearly 20 years to his show; he
felt that he was a great contribu-
tor to Pittsburgh’s local jazz
community. Because of declining
ratings, the station made the
decision to replace his show,
along with two other local week-
end shows, with a national jazz
feed -— speciﬁcally, with a Na-
tional Public Radio jazz program
that WDUQ had been paying for
all along. To assuage the three
hosts that lost their shows,‘ the
station announced that it would
consider them for production
services in the future. This writer
would suggest that the host in
question ought not be consid-
ered for such a position.

Rather than graciously accept
the fact that his role at the station
had changed because of factors
that were essentially economic,
the host decided to vent his
bitterness on the air. Even if the
host was unable to accept the

-winds of change with dignity, he

Michael
Moore ’

should have refrained from de-,

liberately expressing nastiness —
and falsity—— live on his show; it
was irresponsible and inconsid-
erate. WDUQ plays over 50 hours
of local jazz programming a week,
and that he would say there would
be a void seems unacceptable.
This writer would suggest that

the station was careful in its .

decision: the local program was
antiquated in its rotation and
deficient in its audience; the
national show is more timely and
frugal in implementation.
' WDUQ is ownedand operated
by Duquesne University, a good
Catholic school; it almost seems
too forgiving of them to still be
willing to consider the former
host for a position as producer.
To the city's dedicated jazz
community, hearing that there
would no longer be jazz on “DUQ"
was tantamount to them hearing
“ﬁre!” declared on the airwaves,
but it’s the fact that the host
figuratively yelled “fire!” -— with-
out factual justification -— that is
of concern. If a man can betray
his involvement with a station

that he has worked closely with A

for nearly two decades, who's to
say that his judgment would not
once again err in the face of
future disappointment? People in

the broadcast industry must be I

able to remain calm in the face of
a crisis when on the air, and
certainly, a radio host must al-
waysbe careful of whathe or she
says for public reaction. Nobody
who displays poor judgment and
severely allows personal feelings
to color what is to be presented
as factual commentary should be
elevated to a position of author-

ity with any radio station unlessit , ‘

is a “morning zoo” format that is I ,
understood to be an attempt at -

comedy. -

Realistically, what was actually ‘ A
v voiced on the air on that fateful .

Sunday night is, in and of itself,
unimportant. The next day, radio
listeners still found their jazz on

90.5 FM, and the station wasn’t L
‘ horriblyembarrassed—— only the
former host smelled ofegg in the ‘ I

aftermath. In fact, I could pur-
chase tapes containing every word
that the host ever uttered on the
air, and listen to them, or, I could
prick my ears — and either way,

I wouldn’t really hear anything. I
Nothing the host said was really

that important, and the fact that
he has vanished from the air.isn’t
either. Jazz will survive with or
without him. Nothing earth-shak-
ing. 9 . I .
It’s important that we find en-
joyment on the radio, and it is sad

that a man would lose his audi- ‘
ence and his show. But it is,

crucial that WDUQ establish the
fact that in the. radio industry,

nobodyhas the right to blatantly
V voice something that is untrue,
and that no such person should -

get a promotion out of it. Re-
cently, a local jury ruled that
radio hosts were incorrect (and
deserving of punishment) for not
being sensitive to a female col-
league; this time, a radio host
wasn't sensitive to a community
of radio listeners.

After the War of the Worlds
broadcast, the world was made
aware of radio’s power and felt
awe in reaction to Welles’ genius.
After the unfortunate Sunday
broadcast, Pittsburgh was made
aware of radio’s power (as scores
of listeners called the station in
confusion) and later felt pity in
reaction to a man's verbal ﬂoun-
dering. Only there is a vital differ-
ence here: the former host’s wasn't

a brilliant piece of entertainment .

that was misunderstood; it was
an act of deliberate public decep-
tion. L

I wish WDUQ’s Mister Yester-
day the best of luck in whatever
he decides to do now; hopefully,
it won't be live in front of a
microphone.

breaking in Daytona
By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer
DAYTONA BEACH, F LA.——-The 21-hour bus ride from Pittsburgh to
Daytona was, in the words of almost everyone who took the trip, pure
hell.
“There was this guy running up and down the aisle of our bus 4'

saying ‘It’s 7:00 a.m. Have you partied today?’ It was incredible,” said
Howard Gorchov, a Pitt sophomore.

“The bus trip was unbearably long. They would tell us that we were
stopping for ﬁve minutes and it would end up being an hour and a
half,” said freshman Hillary Fitch.

Once the almost 250 spring breakers on the Pitt Program Council’s
trip arrived in Daytona, some things didn’t get any better.

Gregg Gnipp, Pitt senior, said that Spring Break just isn’t as much  '  "   Paul Diamond/The Pm News

“They don’t have as much security at the Pentagon. Everywhere we H
go we have to ﬂash this yellow card that they gave us. Once, they
carded me about seven times on my way in,” he said. .
Tom Misuraca, PPC advisor, said that the security at Howard
Johnsonfs was absolutely necessary.
“There are people who come into town strictly to prey on college
students. The securityis there so that people can’t just walk into the

hotel and knock on someone’s door with some sort of scam,” said
Misuraca. - . ‘

Last year several students complained about the service at the
Howard Johnson's, but Misuraca said that since the hotel has come
under new management things have greatly improved.

“In terms of location and quality of housing, Pitt students are staying
at the best place around. We are right in -the middle of all the action
here. This is the hot area of town with four or five bars right here,”
he said.

Though the bars were close by, some spring breakers opted to party
in, the hotel. While Gnipp and about 10 of his male friends drank ale
through a ﬂuorescent beer bong in their hotel room, he said that a lot
of the preconceptions about spring break are false.

_ “Everyone talks about how spring break is supposed to be just one
gigantic orgy, but we’ve been here for almost a week and ‘we still
haven’t partied with any girls,” he said.

Maria Pekich, senior, said that some of the guys she's seen in
Daytona leave a lot to be desired.

A “Some of the guys here are just out of control. The things they do
are just ridiculous,” she said. i

Pekich and Fitch said that they spent most of their time in Daytona
just laying out on the beach.

“It’s virtually all that I’ve been doing. My sunburn kills,” Fitch said.

While the temperature hovered near 70 degrees all week and most
days were sunny, there were a few periods of rain. With an estimated
$100 million dollars spent by spring breakers in Daytona last year,
sunny or not, it seemed that almost everyone spent some time in the
dozens of gift shops that lined Atlantic Avenue on the beach.

“Those people in the stores are always trying to make some sort of
deal with you,” Fitch said. V ~

Outside many of the stores sales people stood yelling things
like,”Hey beautiful I’ve got a deal for you,” and, “We’ve got the best
prices on the beach,” as students walked by. A few of the ﬂashing
display boards in front of the shops held messages welcoming Pitt
students.

“They are just very pushy. I mean they are really, really pushy, ” Fitch
said. —»

David Hoydick, junior, said that almost everything in Daytona was
very expensive.

“Things cost a lot more here but you have to expect that at a place
like this,” he said.

Gorchov said that many of the clubs that advertise free food with
the cover price are ripping students off.

“Nothing is free around here. When they say free food you still have
to tip someone to get anything," he said.

Despite the gripes, Gnipp said that everyone should experience
Daytona.

“Spring Break in Daytona is just something that you have to do at
least once while you are in college,” Gnipp said.

UCOnn silences skeptics with first Big East crown

By Sean Heilman
Staff Writer

NEW YORK — The Connecticut Huskies
proved they belong among the Big East’s
elite by defeating Syracuse, 78-75, in the
Big East Tournament’s championship game
on Sunday. It was Connecticut’s ﬁrst
conference—tournament championship in
the 11-year history of the Big East.

Tate George, Connecticut’s only senior,
led all scorers with 22 points. Sophomore
guard Chris Smith added 20 points and
tallied 54 for the entire tournament to earn
the tourney’s Most Valuable Player award.

The Huskies had to play most of the
semi-ﬁnal and ﬁnal games without starting
center Rod Sellers, who went down two

minutes into Saturday’s semi-final game
against Georgetown with a sprained left
knee.

Stephen Thompson had 21 for Syracuse.

“This is the highest of the highs we’ve
had all year,” said George, who was
named to the all-tournament team.

It looked as though Connecticut would
go down easily to the Orangemen, falling
behind 10-0 in the game’s ﬁrst four minutes.
But U. Conn. Coach Jim Calhoun called a
timeout to settle his troops.

“We were hurrying our shots,” said
Calhoun. “We didn’t play with the same
poise [offensively] that we played with for
32 games.”

Calhoun said his team was playing as
planned all along, pointing out that

Connecticut had ﬁve steals in the ﬁrst four
minutes.

“Coach said to calm down, take it two
points at a time and keep your poise and
tighten up on defense,” said Smith.

The Huskies regained their composure.
They stayed with the same plan they have
used all year: a half-court pressure defense,
a patient offense and 10 quality players to
battle back into the game.

Connecticut tied the game, 29-29 at the
5:40 mark and then took a 42-35 lead into
halftime.

Syracuse fought back to tie the game at
60 on a Derrick Coleman layup with 7:59
to play. But Connecticut’s Nadav Henefeld
answered with a 12-foot jumper to give
the Huskies the permanent lead.

Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim felt the
Huskies were falling right into his game
plan by playing a patient offense.

“When they held the ball, I thought they
were doing us a favor,” said Boeheim. “I
thought they took bad shots [in the second
half], but they either got it back or made
the bad shots.”

“If I did Jim a favor, I’m glad," said
Calhoun. “We wanted to dictate what we
wanted to do.”

Connecticut (28-S) received the
automatic NCAA tournament bid which
comes with the Big East tournament
championship. Syracuse was extended an
at—large bid, along with Georgetown, St.
John’s, Villanova and Providence from the
Big East.

Annual tournament

with short end of stic/e

NEW YORK —— Pitt came into the Big East tournament last week

with a record (11-16) that would not get the Panthers into
postseason play. Their only chance of entering the NCAA tournament
would be to receive an automatic bid by winning the Big East
tournament championship. V

The Panthers, with their eighth-place ﬁnish in the regular season,
were forced to play ninth-place Boston College on Thursday to
decide who joined the other seven teams in Friday’s quarterﬁnals.

Playing in the dreaded Thursday-night playoff game added to
Pitt’s problems. It meant that the only way the Panthers could win
the tournament would be to play and win on four consecutive days
(Thursday to Sunday) with a lineup consisting of only seven
players who have played over 100 minutes of basketball this
season.

“This is a tournament that if we did get a win out of it, we could
salvage the season and get back in the thick of it and even have
a shot to go on [with the seasonl,” said Pitt Coach Paul Evans.

Evans had nothing to_lose in the tournament. So he planned his
strategy assuming his team was going to play every day, trying to
conserve his players’ energy for the rest of the tournament.

Against Boston College, Pitt played conservatively. It put in
enough effort to win 88-70, but did not want to be worn down for
the Syracuse gamethe next day. '

Arbitration

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

At least one baseball season is
underway.

The Panthers’ 2-4 spring trip to
Florida last week was successful,
according to manager Bob Lewis.

“We were able to work some
things out. The weather was
perfect for our spring training.
We made some mistakes, but
mainly we got work done outside.
From not being outside, the
outfielders did have problems
judging ﬂy balls, but as the week
went, we got better. Overall, we
ended up with more pluses than

not issue for Pittsburgh's other baseball team

minuses.

“The best thing about the trip
was the facilities. We didn’t play
on a bad ﬁeld. That really helped
the players come along a little
faster,” Lewis said.

The trip opened up slowly with
three losses. Pitt fell to St. Joe 10-
3, to Anderson 9-4, and to Rollins
12-3.

That was before sophomore
Fred Iriti took the mound against
Quincy on Wednesday.
According to Lewis, Iriti was able
to take control and go all seven
innings for the 4-2 win. In the
game, Iriti had three strike outs
and no major jams to work himself

out of.

The win helped the Panthers
get back on their feet for their
night game against North Dakota
State. Pitt jumped on them early
and often, en route to an 11-5
victory. Junior Don Carpenetti
got the win with five innings of
work. Sophomore Dennis T erzich
picked up the save with two
perfect innings of relief. '

The next day‘ Central Florida
crushed the Panthers 14-2. “We
played a team that has been
working out [officially] since
January and was playing its 20th
game of the season," said Lewis.

According to Lewis, that was

the same thing that happened
against Rollins College players.
This is their regular season, and
they are already done working
on things. They are just playing
their games. “Rollins is ranked
No. 1 in [its] section and [is] just a
real good team.”

The offensive stars of the trip
were outﬁelder Curvin Richards,
catcher Blane Vucci and first
baseman Rich Yuskas. Richards
hit .333 with a .579 on-base
percentage, and he stole three
bases in four attempts. Vucci hit
.313 and finished the trip with a
ﬁve-game hitting streak. Yuskas
hit .333 and knocked in two runs.

Leading the team with runs
batted in (RBI) were Matt Bianco
and Kirk Domanick, each with

three. Bill Sherbondy, Ralph)

McNelly and Bianco each hit a
home run.

The next game for the Panthers
is this Sunday at Penn State.
“They're in the same boat with
us,” said Lewis. “They just got
done with their spring trip and
are only now able to work outside.

“I [will] probably decide on my
starting pitcher on Thursday. We
have to look to see if there are
any sore arms from the trip, first.
We’re still just preparing for the
Big East season."

Staff Writer‘

Assistant coach of the Lady
Panther gymnastics team, Ben
Rovee summed up this past
weekend's competition when he
said, “It was the comeback of the
century” after Pitt placed second
at Towson Center Arena in
Maryland. ,

Pitt ﬁnished with a score of
181.15, behind hostTowson State

_ University (187.75) and ahead of

Rutgers University (179.15).

The Lady Panthers started off
the first two events with unusually
inconsistent performances.
Although the Pitt squad has been
displaying excellent endurance,
the fact that several of the Lady
Panthers are missing from the
lineup due to injuries and illnesses
took its toll over spring break.

Only seven of 15 gymnasts
were able to participate in the
competition, and of those seven,
still
recovering from the ﬂu. S

famous images of the 20th century.

Now, the  of Rickerby’s work has been collected and prepared for public exhibition. lt’s
a rare opportunity to relive moments in time that have become part of our national heritage.

Head coach Debbie Yohman
said that Karen Jorgenson, who
was out with a back injury, will
be back in practice this week.
Yohman also said that she would
like to see Shelly Sleith do
something in her last home meet,
but her shoulders are still weak.

According to Yohman, Jennifer
Butkovich, out with
mononucleosis, was home in bed
during spring break. Tracy Jung
sprained her ankle and probably
will be out for the next few
weeks.

“The week off from competing
broke our roll, and it was like we
lost all of the excitement. We
really had to fight to get back,
especially in light of the injuries
and illnesses and ﬂu," said
Yohman.

The Lady Panthers opened the
competition on the uneven
parallel bars. “We have problems
on bars,” said Yohman. “Our last
three people are good, solid bar
routines, and our first three are
still inconsistent.”

The Lady Panthers turned in a
total score of 43.3 on bars. After
the first rotation the Lady Panthers
were in second place, trailing
Towson State by 3.7 points.

“Beth [Dyson], when she hits,
she's going to have a good score
for us,” said Yohman. “Beth is a
competitor. On her other three
events you'll find her out there,
and under pressure, she hits, but
she hasn’t shown us that yet on
bars. Once she gets that one
under her belt, she’ll turn into
that competitor on bars.”

The Lady Panthers went into
the third rotation in third place,
trailing Rutgers by 2.5 points. The
Pitt squad turned in strong vaulting
scores all around for a total of
45.6. High scores were turned in
by Brown, Wallish, Dyson,

Borchers and Gina Venezia, who
all scored above 9.00.

Pitt turned the meet around
during its third event, the ﬂoor
exercises. As always, the Lady
Panthers dominated the ﬂoor with
strong performances.

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's basketball team surprised the entire
conference by reaching the semi-finals of the Big East toumament
last weekend in Storrs, Conn.

Pitt upset third-seed Seton Hall in the quarterfinals, 84-77,
then lost to second-seed Providence 89-88 in the semi-finals.
Providence advanced to the ﬁnal, defeating top-seed and host
Connecticut by 21 points.

In Pitt’s victory over the Lady Pirates, co-captain Lorri
Johnson had 24 points and 14 rebounds. Connie Hurt added 23
points and five blocked shots, and freshman point guard
Maureen McConnell added 13 points.

Against Providence, Johnson had 22 points and 12 rebounds,
McConnell tallied 19, and co-captain Jennifer Shingler added
15.

Shingler totalled 16 assists for the tournament, and McConnell
dished out 14.

Johnson was named to the all-tournament team. '

Providence’s Dotti VanGheem sunk a pair of free throws with
10 secon left to give the Lady Friars a one—point lead. Pitt had
enough ti e for one more play to win. Connie Hurt got the ball
in the lane and found Johnson open for a 17-foot jumper, but
the shot was blocked as time ran out.

Method of demise against Syracuse typical of year

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

NEW YORK —— The Panthers
have lost basketball games in
many different ways this season.
It seemed as though they could
not possibly think of any more
ways to lose.

They couldn't. Instead they
borrowed a similar method from
earlier in the season, losing to
Syracuse 58-55 last Friday in the
Big East tournament.

Brian Shorter’s attempted a
driving lay—u p with eight seconds
left and Pitt down by one, but his
shot was blocked by Syracuse’s
Derrick Coleman.

The play drew reflections from
an earlier game this year with
Syracuse.

Pitt (12-17) lost to Syracuse on
January 3 at the Civic Arena when
Leron Ellis blocked a Jason
Matthews shot with ten seconds
left in a tie game. The block set
up a Stephen Thompson three-
point play with three seconds left
for a Syracuse win, 80-78.

“In the first game. . .there was
a great block at the end of the
game. It was the same result
tonight,” said Syracuse coach Jim
Boeheim.

Pitt defeated Boston College,
88-70 on Thursday night to
advance to the Friday quarter-
final game against top seeded
Syracuse. .

The Panthers used a stall offense
to stay close to Syracuse the entire
game. Pitt point guard Darrelle
Porter held onto the ball at rnid—
court before virtually every
Panther offensive attack. The
scheme was used to keep the
starters from wearing down.

Pitt coach Paul Evans said the
ploy was implemented in case
the Panthers advanced in the
tournament.

Syracuse used a full court
pressure defense to try and get
Pitt to speed up their game, more
to Syracuse’s style of play, but
they quickly abandoned that
strategy after the Panthers broke
through for four dunks.

“After the fourth dunk, I figured
that was enough," said Boeheim.

The Orangemen also tried to
change the tempo of the game

1

W

with their offense. Pitt used a 2-
3 zone for most of the game and
Syracuse tried quick passes from
freshman point guard Michael
Edwards into the lane. But Pitt
was able to break up most of
those plays, accounting for most
of Bobby Martin’s four steals.

“We tried to take it into the
teeth of their defense and we
turned [the ball] over,” Boeheim
said.

Pitt’s plan to stall caused
problems for Syracuse, and it was
not very popular with the Madison
Square Garden crowd, who
wanted to see a faster game.
However, the fans sided with Pitt
near the end asthe upset seemed
possible.

Pitt had the ball and a one
point lead with less than a minute
to go. But Rod Brookin was called
for a five second violation, giving
Syracuse the ball with 31 seconds
left.

Syracuse’s star came through
in the clutch. Derrick Coleman

drove into the lane and leaped
over Bobby Martin for a lay up to
take the lead with 19 seconds
remaining. Coleman then came
up with the block on Shorter’s
shot.

Evans doubted that either of
Coleman’s plays were legal.

“I'm surprised somebody (the
referee) would make that call
(five second violation) and not
the next two.”

When asked about the bad
breaks the Panthers have had this
season, Brookin replied, “Things
haven’t gone our way, but we are
a good ball club."

Notes: Bobby Martin scored a
total of 12 points
toumament He is still ten short

of 1000 points. Jason Matthews I

had a tournament high for a single
game, 32 points, against Boston
College. He had 45 points for the

tournament. Porter dished out _

his ninth assist of the tournament
to Brookin for an 18 foot jumper

with 11:55 to play against Boston ‘

College. It gave him 437 career
assists, surpassing Dwayne
Wallace for the all-time Pitt assist
lead. Porter had 21 assists for the
two games, giving him 449 for his
career.

The Pittsburgh Psychoanalytic Institute offers confidential,
professional, low cost evaluations for
ADULTS, ADOLESCENTS AND CHILDREN.
Psychoanalysis entails a commitment to in-depth
psychological exploration with patient and analyst meeting
at a frequency of four or five times a week in order to
change behavior, develop a capacity for new relationships
and achieve a sense of self in deep and abiding ways. The
goals are not only to ease cramped life patterns and
remove symptoms, but also to expand the freedom to work
and to love.
The Institiute is recognized by the American Psychoanalytic
Association as a teaching and training facility.

For information call Susan Chahoy at 661-4224. Evaluation
interviews will be offered by faculty members in their
offices. A prompt reply can be expected. Analyses are

conducted in the Pittsburgh and Latrobe areas.
