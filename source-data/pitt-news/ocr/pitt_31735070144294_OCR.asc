Beware
of thieves

by Halyse Domencic
Staﬂ WrL'ter

W/ith the semester wir1ding
down, many students are packing

their bags and getting ready to leave’

campus for winter break. ,

But they might be unlucky
enough to return to ‘an ‘unpleasant
surprise in January — a apartment
that has been broken into.

But there are steps students can
take to burgler—proof their apart-
ments before leaving Oakland for
home this week.

If any doors, windows or locks '
in an apartment are damaged, stu- ‘

dents should immediately contact
the landlord or management ser-
vice to get them fixed. ,

Pitt’s safety ,Web site suggests
engraving expensive personal be-
longings with a name or identiﬁ-

cation number so that any stolen

property is veriﬁable.

The Pitt police department of-
fers both tools and instructions for
engraving items.

The Pitt police’s Web site also
advises students to lock their doors

and windows, and to not post on '

the door where they are and when
they will be back.

If students do not have a means

‘of locking apartments, they can

also place a dowel or length of
wood into window frames and fit
an unlocked door with a latch and
padlock.

If students are still not sure if
an apartment is secure enough, the
city police offer free security sur-
veys. '

Sun Bowl  

bound: Pitt

accepts bid

by Zack Chakan
Contriéuti/2g E3[[or

After a cloudy three, years
away from the bowl season, the
Pitt football teams postseason
outlook got a lot sunnier after
Saturday’s win over Connecticut.

, Officials from the Sun Bowl
invited the Panthers to the game
slated to start Dec. 31 in El Paso,
Texas, after Pitt’s 34-10 victory
over the Huskies.

- Oregon State was selected as

Pitt’s opponent for the game last .

night. .,

The Sun Bowl, which will air
on CBS at 2 p.m. on New Year’s
Eve, pits the Big East’s second
best team with the Pac—10’s third

_ place finisher.

The game will be a rematch
of the 2002 Insight Bowl, where
the Panthers blew out the Bea-
vers, 38—l3. That affair featured
current NFL stars Larry Fitzger-
ald, Derek Anderson and Steven
Jackson. _

' W/ith Cincinnati headed to the
Orange Bowl as the Big East’s
Bowl Championship Series rep-
resentative and a Big 12 team
tagged for the Gator Bowl, the
Sun Bowl‘ had the second selec-

tion of . Big East schools. Pitt’s

victory conﬁrmed that the team
shares second place in the con-
ference with West Virginia and
Rutgers.

The Mountaineers and Scarlet
Knights were other possibilities
for the Sun Bowl, but Pitt had

the inside track on the bid if it

won Saturday.

The bowl game is the first for
Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt since
he took the position "before the

i 2005 season.

The Panthers finished the year

In memoriam: Vice Chancellor Ana Guzman

by Halyse Domencic
Staff Wrder

Armed with determination,
sophistication and high heals,
Ana Guzman had a smile that
knocked foremen off their feet.

As the University of Pitts-
burgh’s vice chancellor of facili-
ties management, she command-
ed a great deal of respect beneath
her hard ha‘t—covered golden hair.

After a- brief illness, Guzman
died last Monday at UPMC Pres-
byterian.

The architect presided over the
development of all five Pitt cam-

puses and the $2 billion worth
of new construction from 1996
until her retirement in 2005. As
the first woman to be invited into
the Association of University Ar-
chitects and serving as its presi-
dent from 1995 to 1996, Guzman
broke gender barriers in an ocean
of men in hard-hats.

“It is impossible to overstate
the value of her contributions to
the University,” said Chancellor
Mark, Nordenberg in a news re-
lease. “In fact, her impact was so
signiﬁcant that I used to refer to
her, both publicly and privately,

THE BEST PLACES TO STUDY

Guzman first came to Pitts-
burgh in 1967 and was hired by

restoration of Alumni Hall and
the Petersen Events Center.

She also planned campus.

“Everywhere you turn on

Pitt’s campuses, you see a gift that -

was Ana’s,” said Jerome Cochran,
Pitt’s executive vice chancellor, in
a news release.

husband, Alberto Guzman, son
Javier Guzman, daughter Ana Ce-

Pittstudent among baton All Stars in Thanksgiving parade

by Caitlin Kasunich
Staﬂ W/ritver

Maria Gerardi couldn’t believe it
when she heard the invitation.

“USA Baton Twirling All Stars,
come join the parade,” said the
marshall of the Macy’s Thanksgiv-
ing Day Parade this year.

Gerardi, a 19-year-old Pitt
sophomore, marched along 149
other baton twirlers dressed in red
tuxedo—like pant suits with gold
sparkle cumrnerbands, red bowties
and red headbands in the Macy’s
Thanksgiving Day parade.

“It was like time stopped just for

the parade,” she said.

' Gerardi began  when she
was 2 years old, the same year she
received a baton anda costume for
her second birthday. Gerardi be-
gan marching in parades when she
was 4 years old, and when she was
6 she began to compete. H

The parade was the most recent
in a long list of events at which
Gerardi had twirled. In the days
leading up to it, she and her team-
mates practiced 16 hours a day, as
opposed to the 10 to 15 hours she
normally practices each week.

The day of the parade Gerardi
woke up at 3 a.m. and ate break-
fast at 4:30 a.m. before getting on
the bus at 6 a.m. to head into the
city. As she walked with her team-
mates to the steps of a museum in
Central Park West where her team
was to line up, she passed all of the
balloons that were featured in the
parade.

“They were bigger than I ever

could have imagined,” she said.
As she waited in line for two

hours in the 30 degree weather

before performing, she saw Mi-

ley Cyrus, whom the USA Baton I

Twirling All Stars marched directly
in front of during the parade, and
all of the floats._The whole expe-
rience, Gerardi said, was simply a
dream come true.

i “I watch the parade religiously
every year and only wished that
one day I would have the chance
to march into Herald Square,” she

- said. “When I got the opportunity,

it was the most incredible experi-
ence of my life.”

Still, there’s one moment of the .

parade that particularly stands out
in Gerardi’s ‘mind.
“The crowdjwas so receptive

and would cheer for us any time
we did a trick,” Gerardi said. “My
favorite part of the parade was
when I got to [perform a solo] in
Times Square. There is nothing like
standing alone in one of the great-
est cities in the world and doing
something you love. Times Square
is breathtaking to begin with, but
when you get to march through it
with tons of people watching you,
it is even more incredible.”

Gerardi was the only twirler
from the Pittsburgh area on her
team and one of only four people
from Pennsylvania.

“The\ support I received from
the entire Pittsburgh region was
truly touching, and I can’t begin to
thank all of those people who sup-
ported me and tuned in to watch
me twirl,” she said.

The three-mile parade route be-
gan in Central Park West and con-
tinued around Columbus Circle
and through Times Square before
ending up in Herald Square, where

Ger_a_rdi._per_formed in the front

line.
“\When we arrived at Herald

Square, .1. was exactly as you see

it on telex on,” she said.‘ “Macy’s
is all decorated, and people are
screaming for you as you perform.
There is truly nothing like it.”

Although this was the ﬁrst time
that Gerardi marched in the Macy’s
 Day /Parade, she was
not a stranger to performing.

She has also twirled in a pre-
game performance at the Cleve-
land Cavaliers NBA game, the
Shaler Area Homecoming Parade,
Pittsburgh’s St. Patrick’s Day Pa-
rade, three times in Disney World
and numerous school talent shows.

She has also participated in exhibi-

tion solo performances.

She’s been invited to the Twirl
Mania Gold Invitational in Disney
World. .

Gerardi has won three interna-
tional titles, two scholarships, 12

regional titles, three state titles,‘

three chapter titles, an outstand-
ing spirit award and more than 500
trophies, ribbons and medals for
her twirling.

In addition to becoming a ,
‘”member' of “the ‘USA Baton'Twirl-

ing All Stars team," Gerardi has
been twirling with the Sensations
Drum and Baton Corps for the
last 15 years and serves as the cap-
tain of the senior majorette com-‘
petition team. She choreographs
their routines.
Gerardi sticks with the sport be-
cause she loves it.
“I have two favorite things

about twirling,” Gerardi said. “The

ﬁrst is entertaining people. Iilove
to please the crowd, and nothing

beats hearing the crowds cheer

for you as you do a big trick. My
second favorite thing would have

to be twirling ﬁre. I twirl three I

ﬁre batons, and ‘there is nothing

like it. It is quite a rush. Pepple

is something that I have spent a’ '

lot of time practicing and perfect-

“I got involved in twirling, be-
cause my mom and aunts were all

twirlers, so it just ran in the blood,”.

said Gerardi.
Gerardi’s mother traveled to

"New York wiet.thee‘eewaeeh’he; e

“It was anawesome experience

very dedicated to the sport. ‘Being -

given the opportunity to march in

Students receive funding for ‘green’ projects

by Lori Stover
Staﬁ’ Writer

Cheap plasticelnfrared receivers
Solar-assisted wind fans You know,
college stuff.

Ten college students from south-
western Pennsylvania are perfecting
their plans to develop energy-saving
devices meant to “green” old build-'
ings The students are the members
of ﬁve teams of ﬁnalists chosen in
a 2008 Energy Efﬁcient Building
Technologies Challenge competition
sponsored by Pitt’s Mascaro Center
for Sustainable Innovation.

The center gave each team $2,500
to develop prototypes of their ideas

and expects them to deliver ﬁnal pre-» 0

sentations at the 2009 Pittsburgh En-

.  Sustainability Conference

this April.

Micah Toll and Shaun Espen-
shade, two of the competition’s ﬁnal-
ists, plan to use cheap plastic to bring
wind power into the home and an in-
structional manual to teach everyone

how to reduce their energy use

Toll, a sophomore studying me-
chanical  at Pitt; and
Espenshade, a classics and rhetoric
double major at Duquesne Univer-
sity, combined their sldlls to tad<le
the challenge posed by Pitt’s Mascaro
Center for Sustainable Innovation.

The -competition asked under-

_ graduate students from southwestem

Pennsylvania to develop a method
that would pay for itself  a year
of use to make old buildings more
energy efﬁcient Ofﬁcials. at the center

selected ﬁve ﬁnalists from a pool of ,

29 who submitted proposals and gave
them $2,500 to develop their ideas

The competition gives under-
graduates the opportunity to put the
skills they learned in their engineering
classes to real use.

“I think a big misconception is
that kids in school either don’t have
the time or don’t have the willpower
to think of  like this,”isaid Toll.
“A lot of the time, you see these proj-
ects limited to the graduate lev ”

Toll and Espenshade made it top
' the ﬁnals and now plan to bring their

two—part plan ﬁom paper to reality.
The ﬁrst part of their plan consists
of small, inexpensive wind generators
that could be installed on the roof of
any building, or in anyone’s backyard,
to contribute to the .building’s energy
needs.

The second part, ir1 which Es-
penshade used his skills learned; as
a student of rhetoric, consists of an
instruction manual on simple ways to
improve energy efﬁciency.

“As an engineer, I’m not as much
of a linguist as he is,” said Toll of his

partner “I can see how sometimes we ’

get caught up behind the numbers It’s

_ very beneﬁcial to have someone who

thinks on a totally different lev ”

Toll stressed the importance of ,

the simplicity of their design.
“You’ve got a problem, and

sometimes people come up with

overly complicated solutions,” said

Toll. “When it comes down to it, our

project is pretty simple’?

Pitt bioengineering students Craig
Lehocky and Bradley Morneweck
plan to build and program a power
strip to stop devices such as ICD and
plasma televisions ﬁom  onto
stand—by mode instead of shutting
down completely.

'Ihey’ve designed an infrared re-
ceiver, which will intercept the infra-
red  from the television remote
and completely shut off the television
The device, Lehocky said, would cost
about $25 to build and would save

, about $16 worth of ‘power per televi-

sion per year.

The team  also developed an
idea for a device that would ensure
that computer monitors completely
shut off Theproposed circuit, which
the team has not yet designed, would
detect the drop in current when the
computer goes from on to stand—by

Spiritual   students seeking
groups for peace and prayer

by Liz Navratil
Auaidta/zt New Editor

In some ways, they’re search-
ing for the same thing.

“There’s a part of the un-
known they want to feel a part
of,” said Paula Kane, a religious
studies professor at Pitt, of the
students .who seek religion or a
spiritual belief system.

A study performed last year
by the Higher Education Re-
search Institute at the University
of California, Los Angeles, indi-
cated that 74.2 percent of _ college
students say they believe in God,
and 50.4 percent think it’s very
important or essential to inte-
grate spirituality into their lives.

At ‘Pitt, roughly 1,275 of
these students are involved with
religious or spiritual groups on
campus, according to Student
Organization Resource Center
records.

Some of them are following
in their parents’ footsteps. Oth-
ers discovered religion or spiritu-

ality on their own. Some ﬂip—flop '

between groups.

But no matter what their
background, the students inter-
viewed seemed to agree: They
look to their "religion or spiritual
belief system for direction and to
its members for a sense of sup-
port.

Buddhism for World Peace
Lucy Storey, a 31-year-old
student studying sociology at
Pitt, sits in the Mulert Memorial
Room on the second floor of
the Cathedral of Learning on a
Friday afternoon, waiting for the
other members of Buddhism for
World Peace to arrive for their
meeting. ,
“Nam-myoho-renge-kyo” she
chants. Devotion. Mystic Law.
Lotus Flower. Sound. It’s part
of her effort to connect to the
larger universe. .
Storey sits, her hands folded as
if she’s praying, in front of a
table with a wooden chair sitting

atop it. On top of ’ the chair is
the'Gohonzon, a scroll to which
Nichiren Buddhists chant to ob-
tain enlightenment.
Nam—myoho—renge—kyo.
To the outsider, it looks like

‘she’s reciting prayers. But her

actions aren’t religious, she says.
They’re spiritual.
“I’m still an atheist,” said

Storey, who practices ‘Nichiren...

Buddhism, a spiritual practice
that says it’s possible to obtain
enlightenment in this lifetime.
“It’s not a problem if you believe
in God, but there is no concept

of God. We talk about gods and '

devils, but that’s a parable for the
good and evil forces.”

Instead, Storey said, Nichiren
Buddhists search for enlighten-

ment. They believe that the prob— _
lems they face are just challenges .
they must overcome to become a 
strongerspiritually. Chanting will ‘

help them solve their problems.

Economy taking toll on Pittsburgh charities

Food banks looking for
help forthe holidays  

by Kelsey Shea
Co/ztri/Iuti/z_q Editor

Feeding ‘the hungry is one of
Angela Whitt’s main priorities.

“My husband and I, we use to
own small local a grocery store,
so this is what we did. We fed
people,” said Whitt. “Now we’re

retired, and we want to help peo— -

ple the way we know how.”

So Whitt and fellow parish-
ioners from St. Philip’s Parish’ in
Crafton visit the Greater Pitts-
burgh Community Food Bank
once a month to pack, sort and
distribute food to the ‘needy.

St. Philip’s runs, its ‘own food
bank out of its church, but volun-
teers say they like to come down
to the community food bank’s

headquarters once a month to
help out. I ‘

And with the tanking economy
and upcoming holiday season,
the food bank is in great need of
help from organizations like St.
Philip’s. ‘

With the holidays approaching
and‘ the economy crashing, the
Greater Pittsburgh Community
Food Bank faces a serious short-

age this year and must rely on_

people like Whitt and St. Philip’s
Parish to give them the help they
need. -
‘‘\With the holidays and win-
ter heating bills, this is always our
busiest time of year,” said Iris Va-

Panic.

It’s the ﬁrst word thatcomes
to mind, said Caroline Wood-
ward, director of development
and public relations for Bethle-
hem" Haven, 21 Fifth Avenue shel-
ter that primarily serves homeless
and low-income women. 0

Bethlehem Haven, like other
shelters and soup kitchens in
the area, is in a double bind. The
economy’s suffered so much that

it’s worried it’ll see a decrease in
donations. At the same time, more .

people are using its services.

It’s hard to tell what will come
next, said Woodward. Bethlehem
Haven will be ﬁne for at least a
few months, she said. The group
collected its last round of dona-

tions in September and temporar- ‘

ily evaded the economic crisis that
bit early this fall. It’ll discover its
effects in the spring, when they
.attempt to collect again.

“We’re worried,” she said.

cc‘  

We're worried, but we

will never close our

Woodward

“[But] we "will never close our
shelter. We had a woman die on
the streets last year because she

froze to death." In a country like .

ours, there’s no way people should
be dying on the streets.”
Woodward said Bethlehem

Haven will rely mostly on the
generosity of individual donors.
Corporations, she said, tend to
donate less’ money during a crisis
because it’s harder for them to
acquire tax credits. But individual
donors are relentless.

“My experience  is it’s the
individual giver who "continues to
give and may even ratchet up, be-
cause they’re giving out of their
hearts,’7 said Woodward. “It’s
their own goodwill.” -

She added that the shelter is
particularly pressed now because
more people are looking for its
help. Bethlehem Haven used to
serve" rniddle—age wom-
en who were chronically home-
less, she said.

But .that’s changed in the past,

few. months. Now, Woodward
said, the majority of Bethlehem
Haven’s visitors are 20—something-

said Storey. “It allows you to con-
nect to this part of the universe.

At the very least, it gives you this -

feeling of clarity. It helps you put
everything in order.”

Storey said she found Nichiren
Buddhism almost seven years
ago. A woman she was working
for used to chant every day. Sto-
rey said she was always interested
in the woman’s practice but never
tried it until one day when she
was stressed.

Storey said her boss told her
to try chanting and, “The mo-
ment I started chanting I real-
ized I had no direct goals. I never
wanted to do anything.” I

Now, Storey’s on track” to
graduate in April with a bache-
lor’s degree in sociology. She said
she hopes to one day become a
professor.

Robert Koutsoyannis; a 23-
year—old electrical engineering
graduate student at Carnegie Mel-

lon Universi said he was “born
9

into the practice” of I Nichiren

Buddhism.

It’s been a constant source of
inspiration in his life.

“I kind of understood
that if you chanted mystically,
things would .work out for you.
You passed your test,” he said.
“There’s nothing one can’_t ac-
complish through keeping steady
determination. I’m convinced
that if I need something, I need
to do something, I chant.’-’ ' I

Christian Student Fellowship

Every Thursday night, mem-
_bers of -the Christian Student

Fellowship, which is comprised
of both Pitt and Carnegie Mel-
lon University students, meet in
the \William Pitt Union for a de-
votional. '

They typically spend the first

10 to 15 minutes casually talking, .

sing a few worship hymns and
then, depending on their mood,
do a Bible study or watch a mov-
ie, said Greg Voss,'the minister
whohelps -organize the group.
“They want to feel like they’re

learning, academically, spiritually, _
. socially,” he said. “And it’s at a

different level than they’ve been
at before.”

It’s a close—knit,. no_ndenorni—
national group, he added.

“I had _one girl that‘ called our

group ‘the rejects of religious

groups" because we do have

> quirky people, and I’ve been told

they feel like they can be them-
selves,” he said. g
,Matthew Neupauer, a Pitt

I senior majoring in industrial en-

gineering, said being part of the
group changed his lifestyle. His

‘ religion, he said, is now the most

important part of his life.
“I can say that everything I do
in my life right now I consider

‘what the Lord wants ‘me to‘ do,”
he said. “I would say that before.

have everyone like me. ‘When’ I
started to focus on the Lord as

was raised in a Christian home,
he didn’t begin. to feel connected
to his faith until his sophomore
year of college, when he realized
he needed a change.

But he said he believes his god
didn’t forget about him.

Neupauer said he fell in love
with industrial engineering and
particularly enjoyed an engi-
neering' seminar he attended his
freshman year. .

English departmentcreates own policy

Code, page 1

ment Board. —

If the council decides there’s
a need, the academic code of
the School of "Artsand Sciences
could be revised to specify the
topic of multiple submissions.
Frederick Whelan, assistant dean
of undergraduate studies for
Arts and Sciences, said adding a
new type of offense to the code
does not happen often.

In the meantime, the English
department authored its own
policy on multiple submissions.

A student may submit a paper
more than once as longas he re,-_[

ceives prior permission fromthe '

instructor. If thefstudent is sub-
mitting the same paper simulta-
neously in two classes, he needs
permission from both ‘instruc-
tors. If the paper is from a pre-S‘
vious class, he needs permission
from only his current instructor,
said David Bartholomae, chair
of Pitt’s English department. ‘
But Manfredi believes the
code already mentions the sub-

ject of multiple submissions,
though it might need clariﬁca-
tion. _ _

“We will be considering a re-
quest to clarify the policy, but

_I’m’ ‘quite satisﬁed that the cur-'

rent policy addresses the issue,”
he said. “I think right now the

academic integrity policy clearly

indicates that one cannot submit
an assignment in,a way that is
against the wishes of an instruc-
tor.” ‘
Manfredi made reference to
two partsulof the code that out-

if he _“refers. during ,an aca-
demic evaluation to materials or
sources, or employs devices, not

“practices any form of deceit in

ingi” _

. The issue of multiple subrnis—
sions came to light this past se-
mester when two English profes-

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

sors were discussing a student’s
paper and discovered it was the
same paper, said Bartholomae.
The professors wanted to punish
the student-who submitted the
same paper, but they could not
ﬁnd a policy within the School
of Arts and Sciences’ academic
code that prohibited more than
one submission of a paper.

~ “I think a lot of faculty mem-

bers thought [multiple submis-

sions] was [a form of] cheating
and were a little surprised when

[It's not as though we found a

crying need for a rule or that

e Bartholomae

they looked and it wasn’t in the
code,” said Whelan. “There is no

policy against this. As it stands
right now, it’s not cheating, un-
less of course the teacher makes
an announcement, but most
teachers wouldn’t think to make
an announcement about it.”

The policy relies on students’,

honesty.

Bartholomae, who is also an
English professor, said he ex-
pects a student who submits an
old paper to extend the argu-
ment or make signiﬁcant revi-
sions to it.-

' “There’s a way of doing this
that would be cheating, and
there’s a way of doing this that
would be intellectually reward-
ing,” he said. “The question is
not ‘Can you write a paper on
Moby Dick?’ The question is
‘What work on ‘Moby Dick have
you done in my course under my
supervision?” »

Bartholomae said. multiple
submissions cases are not com-
mon, but he still felt the depart-

ment needed an established rule. .

15

“It’s not as though we found
a crying need for a rule or that
there was widespread double
submissions,” he said. “We tend
to prepare assignments that are
quite speciﬁc to a course, so it
would be odd that a paper for
one course could be used for an-
other course.”

Short story writing classes
and creative writing classes are
more apt to encounter multiple
submissions cases, said Bartho-
lomae. '

Chuck Kinder, who teaches a
senior seminar in ﬁction writing,
said he actually asks students to
submit an old work to be revised
for their ﬁrst assignment. But he
would not allow any” old pieces
beyond that.

"‘It’s important to go back
and visit old work,” said Kind-
er. “[After the ﬁrst assignment]
I would tell [students] they can
talk to me privately [about the
work], but they can’t submit it
for the class.”

Professors face long Week of grading

Professors, page 2

of three four-to-six—page essays
selected by the student from his
or her body of work, an exercise
from the class and a brief retro-
spective essay discussing the de-
velopment of the student’s writing
over the course of the term.
“Once I receive the portfolios,
I’ll need.to read through a little
more  300 pages of work,
some of it familiar but mostly
revised,” said Applegate. “That’s
the ﬁrst step, and it has taken me
between eight and 10 hours in the
past.” ,
Next, Applegate has to take a
close look at the midterm range
and the attendance in her class, as
well as the retrospective essay of
each student. Although she has .a
rough rubric and the course state-
ment nearby, vApplegat‘e doesn’t
use a quantitative method to de-
termine her students’ grades.
Instead, she gives each stu-
dent a provisional grade by giv-
ingrespective weights to his or
her attendance, participation and

/.,,

engagement demonstrated in the
portfolio, which takes about two
hours.

Finally, she puts the total number
of each letter grade side by side to
ﬁnd out if she has given out rea-
sonable amounts of each grade. If
necessary, the last thing she must
do is post the grades online, which
generally takes very little time.

about their writing, it seems only
natural to reflect on the semester’s
work in the same way.” -
Similarly, Valerie Qke, an assistan

professor in the biological scienc-
es department at Pitt who teaches
microbiology and genetics,’ said
that it will take her approximately
10 to 12 hours of solid grading
over a two- to three-day period

Although the
grading process 
can be very te-
dio_us for profes-
sors during ﬁnals’

“The quality and development

“Having closely followed the de-

Half of the points for Oke’s
microbiology ﬁnal exam ‘come
from multiple choice and ﬁll—in—
the—blank questions, while the

other half of the points come
from short-answer questions. The
short—answer questions are the
most ﬁme consuming, because
Oke has to read each answer very
carefully  distribute partial

credit for some students’ answers. '

“You can ﬁnd yourself going

in circles in orderito make partial ‘

credit fair, so that can take a long
time,” said Oke.‘ “There also might
be a problem with how you\ word-
ed a question, or you discovered a
major misconception  you didn’t
know the students had. These are
the ones that are tricky to deal with
and take even longer.”
Additionally, although multiple
choice questions have one right
answer, Oke said that students in
her classes generally do better on

short-answer questions than on’

the multiple-choice section, be-
cause it partly all comes down to
students having more ﬂexibility to
show what they know.

Some of her students, however,
prefer multiple-choice questions

on examinations, so- this gives her
a chance to cover a few more top-
ics in class. But she never allows

multiple-choice sections to consti- .

tute more than 20 percent of the
examination, she said.

“I never even considered doing
an all multiple-choice [test],” said
Oke. “I went to a small school,
and we just didn’t use Scantrons,
because they didn’t exist. It just
depends on the type of course.”

~ In Oke’s genetics class, for ex-
ample, all multiple-choice tests are
never an option since the class is
all about problem—solving, she
said. A V

Besides grading ﬁnal examina-
tions, however, Oke also spends
her time during ﬁnals week catch-
ing up on things that she did not
have time to. do earlier on in the
semester, including writing letters
of recommendation for students,
writing ‘papers and completing
other departmental business.

“It’s all about time manage-
ment,” said Oke.

break here or there,” said Shiner.

But he still sets study goals
for himself, locking himself up in
I-lillman Library until he has ﬁn-
ished what he planned to study.

In terms of noise level, Na-
than has found a balance, too.

“I like it to be quiet, but not
completely quiet,” he said. “A lit-
tle bit of soft music works, some
easy alternative rock.”

Lucy Scalise, a first—year grad-
uate student in Pitt’s School -of
Nursing, has years of experience
in discovering what works for
her.

She uses a grid format to write
out her schedule for the rest of
the week.

Besides making schedules and
taking breaks, students can avoid
the biological effects of stress by
eating right and getting enough
sleep, said Dr. Elizabeth Wettick,
director of Pitt’s Student Health
Services.

“People need to get at least

seven hours of sleep,” said Wet-
tick. “Studying efﬁciency goes
down asyou get tired.”

She also recommended eating
lots of protein-packed foods in-
stead of junk food and to not go
overboard on coffee.

“Caffeine is a great drug, but
don’t overdo it,” said \X/ettick.

For students with little time to
think about their diets, this medi-
cal advice is difﬁcult to apply to
real life. _

“I’m on the liquid coffee diet,”
said ﬁrst—year nursing student Jes-
sica Burns. “Any caffeinated bev-
erage works.”

But Burns and her study part-
ner, Scalise, chose to snack on
cheese and peanuts, two foods
high in protein and good for brain
function.

Others,_like Shiner, don’t eat
so healthily.

“I eat very poorly during finals
week,” he said. “I usually end up
ordering out during ﬁnals week.”

of challenges -this year leading up to the
holiday season, when many families, need
the food bank’s help the most.

An increase in demand and a decrease in
supply plagues the food bank and brought
its supplies critically low several times this
In September its food stock was
down-500,000 pounds from what it was in

' September 2007.

“Nationwide, it’s not as easy to get do-

across the country is that -food manufac-

turers produce less food now and sell what.

little remaining overstock they have to re-
sale discount stores, like Big Lots.
The price of food is another inhibit-

ing factor this year. According to Valanti, .

even the price of wholesale food is up by
88 percent, which‘ prevents the food bank
from getting more bang for its buck.

And with the food bank supplying food’

' The food bank just pulled $170,000
from emergency funds to restock its sup-
plies, and Valanti said it has temporarily
recovered. ‘

‘ “At the moment we’re on track for the -

year,” she said. “But our year starts in July,
and things didn’t really go down the poop-
er until October, so we’ll see.” ' i A

Increase in demand, decrease in supply hurting banks

their overstock to discount grocery outlets,
according to their director of communica-

_ tions, Melissa Etshied. .

“Companies are more sophisticated with
their process now,” she said.

Despite the decrease in corporate donors
Etshied still considers the_Central Pennsyl-
vania Food Bank to be in a good position

, for the upcoming holiday season.

“We’ve definitely had to purchase more

P food to meet the demand, but we’re still in

a position of strength.” .
The Emergency Food Assistance Pro-

gram, a federal program designed to help

provide federal] commodities to the states
that then distribute food out to the needy,
is also seeing problems "with the growing
demand.

The program’s director, Geoffrey Dun-
away, said the organization is" facing a 30 to
35 percent increase in demand.

“Unfortunately when you havea down-
turn in an economy like we’re having, you
see this increase in demand,” said Dun-
away. '

“A new farm bill, passed earlier this year, ,

will increase theamount of food that’s go-
ing out to the states will double the food
that Pennsylvania receives,” said Dunaway.

_ Pennsylvania received $1.84 million in
additional food, which began distribution

' this past November.

“When you have a down economic time,

you want to do everything you can to sup— »
F port, food and shelter programs. It’s' the

time when youneed these programs the

1 most,” said Dunaway.

The task of raising the money and sup-
plies to keep the food bank running falls
mainly on the community of Pittsburgh,
according to Valanti.

“People are aware of how bad things
are,” she said. “They’re 'worried.”'

Local groups from all over Pittsburgh are

doing their part to help the food bank, but

_ it’s not just churches and schools this year.

Local band

puts on shoW
to help cause

Banks, page 18

Many companies and groups not common-
ly associated with charity raised money and
goods to help the food bank this year.

Local punk band Anti—Flag hosted a con-
cert entitled “Yes We Can” to raise money
and supplies for the food bank last month
at Mr. Smalls Funhouse in Millvale.

“We caught wind that the food bank was
h_aving troubles and said, ‘What can we do
to help?’ so we talked to them and found
out they were in need of money, aware-
ness and goods,” said Chris Bollinger, more
commonly known as Chris #2, the bassist
and lead vocalist of Anti—Flag.

“There are a lot of important causes out
there in the world, and I think people in our
own city being taking care of is an impor-
tant one,” said Bollinger.

A Pittsburgh native, he encouraged fellow
Pittsburghers to rise to the challenge.

“This town and city is notorious for tak-
ing pride in itself,” he said.

Another Pittsburgh entity supporting the
food bank is Iron City Brewing Company.
They work with the food bank every year
and sponsor an annual blues festival to help
raise money. This year, in light of the re-
cent economic problems, they stepped up
their efforts and aim to raise 50,000 pounds
of food by the end of December. They
placed all their beer on sale and will encour-
age consumers to drop off cans at their lo-
cal Iron City distributors when they stop by
to pick up their discounted booze.

“It’s Christmas time and everyone is
struggling with the economy being the way
it is, so we wanted to do a great good will
project,” said Shelby Cole, the promotions
coordinator at Iron City Brewing Company.
“It’s a great way to say thank you to Pitts-
burg .”

“It does get hard to balance school work

something you will have forever, so I make
that my top priority.”

Pitt Celebrates first
bowl invite in years

in the 101st Backyard Brawl on Nov. 28.

Bowl, page 1

9-3, the program’s first 9—win regular sea-
son since 1982. . _

“This is the 75th anniversary of [the
Sun Bowl] ,” said Wlannstedt. “That speaks
for itself, the way some of these bowls
turn over and change. It’s a great time, it’s
a great bowl.

“We wanted to win the championship,
we didn’t, but it’s the second best bowl in
our conference. That’s the best we could
do at this time.” 4

Wannstedt said that the team will_ get a

5 little bit of a_break during ﬁnals weelg but
V that it’ll be ready to go the following week.

' Wmmstedt was 16-19 in his ﬁrst three

- seasons at Pitt and failed to reach a bowl ,

game. . A
The closest any of his teams cameto the

- postseason was in 2006, when the Panthers

started 6-1 but lost their ﬁnal ﬁve contests.

“We’ve got three seniors on offense and
three seniors on defense,” said'Warmstedt.
‘‘We’re not a senior team by any means. I
think we’re doing itithe right way, we’re ﬁl-
tering in some of the younger players with
the [older players] .” I _

“\X7e’ve just got to continueto recruit
well. We have to  like we have down
the stretch. You’ve got to have ability, but
you’ve got to have character too.”

Pitt halfback LeSean McCoy ﬁnished
the regular season with 1,403 yards on 284

. carries and 21 touchdowns.

He ﬁnished tied for -second in the coun-
try in rushing touchdowns, only one be-

Bowl selection. The No. 25 Beavers actu-
ally were a win away from the Rose Bowl,
but fell in their season ﬁnale with in-state
rival Oregon, 65-38, on Nov. 29.

Oregon State was demolished at Penn
State in the second game of the season, but
rebounded to knock off then No. 1 ranked
USC almost, three weeks later.

Three of _ the Beavers’ losses came
against ranked opponents. They lost by
three to Utah, 31-28, Oct. 2. Utah is one of
two undefeated teams left in college foot-
ball, along with Boise State.

Oregon State’s offensive attack is paced
by freshman running back Jacquizz Rod-
gers. _ .
Rodgers rushed for 1,253 yards and 11
touchdowns in his ﬁrst season, but missed

the loss to Oregon because of a shoulder

injury.

Junior quarterback Lyle Moevao has
thrown for 19 scores this season, and re-
ceivers Samrnie Stroughter and Shane Mo-
rales combined for 15 touchdown recep-
tions.

Veteran. coach Mike Riley is in the sixth
season of his second tenure at Oregon
State. Riley headed the program in? 1997
and 1998, before jumping to the NFL to
coach the San Diego Chargers for three
seasons. 5 ~

\X/annstedt said that he doesn’t know’

much about Oregon State and hasn’t seen
it, play this year, but that he knows Riley
from his days in" the NFL. _

“I-Ie’s deﬁnitely an offensive guy,” said
Wannstedt. “But I don’t know what they’ve
done.”

Religion 'not always the focal point’ of

Groups, page 12

Her father was Catholic, and her
mother was Jewish.

That changed when she start-
ed going to the Hillel Jewish Uni-
versity Center of Pittsburgh.

“I realized that you can’t be
half Jewish,” said Adelmann,
Hillel’s president. _ _

Adelmann said participating
in Hillel activities taught her that

_there’s more to her faith than

simply religious activities.

Yes, the group holds Shab-
bat services and hosts meals on
religious holidays. But religion,
she said, is “not always the focal
point. The -majority of students
would not consider ourselves ul-
tra observant.”

Former Hillel president Becca
Lehner said one of ‘the group’s
main goals is to connect students

to the University and Pittsburgh

communities.

Lehner said Pittsburgh’s Jew-
ish community is so large that if
she had an idea for an activity, if
she wanted to try to bring a band
to campus, for example,‘ there

was always someone who could
help her do it.
This year the group tested

»a program called Hometown
Pittsburgh, which gives Hillel’

members opportunities, through
mentoring programs and net-
working events, to get to know
Jewish people working through-
out Pittsburgh.
“Hillel provides you with an out-
let for things you want to do,”
said Lehner, former Hillel presi-
dent. A

Lehner added that the group’s
laid—back.nature inspired her to
more actively study her religion.

“Judaism has always played a
huge role in my life,” said Leh-
ner. “Since I haven’t had it forced
onto me, it’s mademe more open
to [study] it.”

Baha’i Campus Association
Lahia Anr1is—Christy’s Squirrel
Hill apartment is dark except for

"a few tea lights spread out over

her. glass coffee table.
Nine people, many of whom

attend Baha’i ‘Campus Asso-

.ciation meetings, sit in a circle

around the table, their eyes closed

’ and their hands folded together

in prayer.

For a few minutes, the only »

sound is of everyone breath-
ing. They’re silently praying to
their god, who they believe sent
Abraham, Buddha, Kris/hna, Je-
sus, Moses, Muhammad and Z0-
roaster. To them, each of these
men proclaimed the message
from one god who teaches them
that all people are equal and that
world peace is attainable. A

A few minutes pass and Jason
Rafalak, a fellow Baha’i, begins to
quietly play the guitar.

“Oh God, guide -me, protect
me,” Rafalak sings. “Make of me
a shining light.”

Annis—Christy, the president
of the Baha’i Campus Associa-
tion and a Pitt undergraduate,
and the others join in. The music,
Annis—Christy will later say, helps
her connect with her god.

“Music is unique because it

 

bypasses the ﬁlters of the mind
and goes straight to the soul,”
she said.

Annis—Christy said that in ad-
dition to attending devotionals,
she makes an effort to pray daily
to stay connected to her religion,
with which she grew up.

“The effort to be a Baha’i is
very conscious,” she said. “It’s
not a default thing. There is no
clergy. There is no service. If you
want to develop spiritually, it re-
ally is on an individual basis.”

After high school, Annis-
Christy spent a year in,El Salva-
dor teaching classes and leading
devotionals on the Baha’i faith.
She said the experience showed
her what she wants to do with
her life. -

She’ll graduate from Pitt this
spring with a degree in Spanish
and hopes to one day teach Eng-
lish as a second language.

Annis—Christy said her expe-
rience in El Salvador reinforced
for her the Baha’i. philosophy
thatpeople, regardless of their

spiritual events  

nationality, are more alike than
they are different.

“Yes, I’m American, but that
doesn’t separate me from the rest
of the world,” said Annis—Chris-
ty. “We’re all connected.”

And that aspect of the Baha’i
faith shows at their meetings. The
members come from a variety of
backgrounds. Some have Middle
Eastern ‘roots and speak some
Farsi. Others ‘are black and sev-
eral are white, like Annis—Christy.

They sit in their circle, many
with smiles on their faces, some
with their eyebrows crunched to-
gether in concentration.

“My God, my adored one, my
king, my desire, what tongue can
voice my thanks, voice my thanks
to thee?” they sing.

The wick on one of the tea
lights burns bright orange and
then goes out with a puff of
smoke.

Their devotional is over. But
that’s only one step, Annis—Chris-
ty said, Baha°is take when they’re
working toward peace.

J€JCL£Ll[- 6ZW6_ZI‘6I’l€Jd 0/Z CCZIIZIULM

Sex might be something
that some students are com-
fortable with only when it’s
behind closed doors. But if
the current trend at institu-
tions like Rice University, Co-
lumbia and Harvard catches
on, it could be something that
you can pick up for free at any
news stand.

Students at those universi-
ties and several others have
started a variety of magazines
dealing with sexual issues and
sexuality in an effort to “ap-
proach sexuality in a smart
manner,” according to Rachel
Solnick, the editor in chief of
Rice’s Open Magazine. S

These magazines run the
gamut of sex-related content,

publishing everything from.

erotic fiction and poetry, to
question-and-answer sections
on birth control and abor-
tion, to nude and semi-nude
pictures of students in erotic
poses. _

While some people have
questioned the ethics of
these magazines, it seems like
they’reian effective way to get
students actively involved with
sexual health and awareness
on campus, as well as offer-
ing a public forum for sexual
advice, education and discus-
sion.

It’s a fact that sex is a part
of student life. Students are
going to engage in sexual ac-
tivity, and the only way to
make sure it’s safe for them
is to make surethat they have

access to and are aware of ed-A

ucation programs.

A study sponsored by Tro-
A jan condoms found that Pitt’s
sexual health programs don’t
measure up well to those of
other ' universities, ranking
only 73 out of 139 universi-
ties surveyed. And while there

are events sponsored by Resi-

- dence Life and Student Health

that purport to educate stu-
dents about sexual health, we
wonder how often students
tap these resources. '

Something like a maga-
zine dealing with these issues
would be an excellent addi-
tion to Pitt’s 'sexual health
program. Student Health and
ResLife do a good job of pro-
viding services to students,
but the promotion of these
services and events is often
low and sometimes
existent. A magazine dealing

I'lOI1-

with some of the same issues

would provide a public forum
for discussion and education,
and it would be easily avail-
able, as well.

A magazine . like this

~wouldn’t be just a review
of high school health class, '

though, but an opportunity
for students to express and

discuss sexuality in the pub-

lic sphere. Although they still
have to deal with the stigma
of being “erotic publications,”
these magazines bring sex out
into the light and allow people
to discuss it freely.

Programs like these aren’t
withoutjdownsides, of course.
The existing magazines have
been accused of objectifying

women and publishing gra-'

tuitous, unnecessary nudity.
Students, have to be careful
that the content they produce
is indeed of social merit and
that it is well—executed.
However, given that a mag-
azine like this could be run
responsibly and sensitively, /it

provides a huge service to a ~

student body by giving them

a way to learn about and dis-_

cuss sex in an environment
that doesn’t discourage it, but
rather actively fosters it.

Big The, Big Boi too big to fail

by Lewis Lehe
Co/um/ulit

    

I am glad this economic crisis
has ﬁnally exposed one of the con— '
tradictions of our economy: that
proﬁtable companies continue un-
harmed and only companies that
are losing money go bankrupt. If
we ran our schools like we run our

economy, probably less than half
the kids would read at grade level. I

When a company does poorly
for a long time, then it obviously
needs money. But greedy bankers
refuse to lend to companies that

have been bleeding money, be- '

cause theyre afraid the companies
will go bankrupt‘— a self-fulﬁlling
prophecy.

Banks are like blood banks that

’ will_only give you blood if they see

you walking around on the street,
totally not bleeding at all, maybe
even on your way to donate some
blood yourself. But if -they see you

‘in the emergency’ room with an
arrow in your neck, they’re like,

“Ummm... I dunno, man.” How
messed up is that?

Blood banks are perfect analo-'

gies for banks, especially now that

they are always asking for emer-
gency transfusions.

Banks aren’t the only ones

on life support, though. The Big
Three are in dire straits. It’s like
they’ ve all got arrows in their necks
from unlikely accidents sustained
while shooting apples off their
Adam’s apples. Meanwhile, banks
and investors are giving them the .
- proverbial empty IV bag.

But the Big Three are too big

to fail: “big” is in their name. Big
Boi is also too big to fail. Every-
day Americans had been calling '
Chrysler, Ford and General Mo-
tors “The Big Three” for years
before the phrase “too big to f ' ,”
was born. And even if ' some-
one had never heard of The Big
Three, if you said it, he or she
would assume you were talking
I about Chrysler, Ford and General
A Motors. ‘

The Big Three are so important

, that I .don’t know why consum-
ers don’.t buy'more of their cars.
A company’s importance is more
than the extent to which consum-
ers choose its products over com-
petitors’. It’s the fantastic pride
we feel every rush hour when T
we see the highway chock full of

big, thundering, hungry American
cars, idling like sleeping dinosaurs,
spewing their mighty breath into
the atmosphere. “Rooooar!” they
seem to say. Or “caaaaar!” g

Soon, our mighty vehicles will
fade as the real dinosaurs did,
dragging their tails into the sun-
set forever. Then we’ll just have
little Toyotas scurrying close to the
ground like early mammals. And
what- did mammals ever accom-
plish?‘ They just took advantage
of how, after the asteroid, there
wasn’t enough energy for the di-
nosaurs.-

Why are we, as a country,‘ on
the hook? First, the Treasury made
huge mistakes in our ﬁnancial bail-
outs. So for fairness’ sake, we owe
other sectors an equal shake at the
types of mistakes we made. Any-
way, now that we’ve wasted more
than $100 billion on AIG, there is
much more leftover for The Big
Three than if we hadn’t.

Second, all the pundits hit the <

nail on the head in pointing out
that we, as a country, dropped the
ball whenwe didn’t require The
Big Three to build fuel-efficient.

For ﬁnal exam success, don't follow this exam le

by Ben Korman
Co/mmzziit -

Dear Professor, before 
this ﬁnal exam, please consider the
following. -

Believe me —it’s been a pleasure
sitting in your lecture for the past

I couple of months I come every day,

I take notes, I watch your PowerPoint
presentations and‘ generally listen to
the  that you have to say In fact,
I like to think of this course as the pre-
meal breadbasket of my academic
career. Allow me to explain:

_ When you’re about to go out
for dimer, your focus is always on
the entree or your companions or the
wine, if that’s the kind of restaurant

you  And then you sit down and

there’s this big loaf of warm, just-

That is what your course does
for me on a daily basis. And if you’ll
allow me to take the analogy a step
further, I would say that our textbook
is that little dish of extra—virgin olive
oil that they give you to dip the bread
in, and your Course\Web materials are
those spicy red bits ﬂoating around in
11'.

I came into this ﬁnal exam
humbly conﬁdent I reread all of
my notes three times. I reviewediall
of the PowerPoint ﬁles For the past
week, all 12 pages of your ﬁnal exam

and plastered onto the walls of ' my
shower. I did this because I like to take
really long, productive showers.

However, despite all my
conscientious preparation, the essay

why page six of my copy is a shot-
by—shot analysis of the famous wood
chipper scene in “Fargo.”

' I must also admit that I did miss
one lecture because of illness I’m ﬁne
now, even though the practitioner, at
Student Health described the growth

A as “obscenely globular.” At the next

lecture, I was sure to obtain notes
from the one I missed from another
student

Although that  lesson’s
apparent lack of substance ﬁrst
struck me as peculiar (the notes most
prominently featured the days date
and the phrase “reaction to stimuli”
circled and underlined multiple
times), he assured me that he was a
judicious note—taker who “doesn’t

I have also had to deal with
some formidable distractions during
the ﬁnal unit of the course that may
compromise my performance on this
most weighty of exams.'See, shortly
after the last exam, I realized that the
ﬁfth season of “Lost”  in a
matter of months, which of course
meant that I had to start re-watching
seasons one through four so that

I I’d have allithe necessary plotlines‘

available for instantaneous recall come
February. I have tried my best not to
let this interfere with my schoolwork.
The same goes for the 18 credits I’m
currently  my overnight job at
UPMC, and the untimely deaths of
several close family mernbers_

though, please avoid physically

I wonder how many points I can
afford to lose on this essay and still get

To the Editor,

In the editorial Dec. 4, titled “Education for All,” you contend that the solution to our edu-

Lehe, page 24

stupid mammals

Dinosaurs were cooler than

‘anyway’

cation problem is not to ask schools to justify their ridiculous “necessary” spending, but simply

subsidize "what is already vastly overpriced. What you have is rampant spending by universities ’

nationwide in a‘ bid to attract applicants. '

But in the very same breath you ask taxpayers to foot the bill for higher education, while

on the front page of your paper is justification for salary increa'ses to Pitt faculty in the range
of 5 percent. The reasoning is that Pitt can support these raises through donations. But the
increasing burden placed on current students will virtually guarantee that their income won’t
be increasing at a proportional rate to match what they spend. '

In virtually every major news sourceare reports _of tremendous sacriﬁces such as job cuts
and sales of assets made by corporate America to realign their spending and budgets with the
realities in the markets. We see Detroit pleading for a handout when it was their failed policies,
and thoseof the unions, which lead to their demise. Are we to reward this behavior? Universi-
ties across the country are simply spending wildly in the mistaken belief that the'automatic
spending of students and their families will support such an increase. ,

Socialized education already exists in Allegheny County. Look at the example set by our
local schools. Allegheny County has the highest property taxes in the state, all driven by edu-
cational spending. When the schools want more money, they just increase local taxes. Is it any
wonder that Pittsburgh can’t attract businesses or keep its graduates here? But this doesn’t
translate to better education —— just look to the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment
results. Then match that up with teacher salaries to see that Pennsylvania educators are paid
exceptionally well compared to other workers for merely average results. '

Socialism doesn’t work, period. When you divorce risk from reward, you get mediocrity.
Education should be a scarce resource, or else you encourage watered-down “diploma-lites”
being issued when students don’t challengethemselves because they aren’t paying for it. The
real answer to keeping education costs in check is not to let our increasingly large government
handle the task, but to force schools from one-upping each other in a massive spending spree
that doesn’t further education but looks good to all those prospective freshmen.

Local record stores strugg e

by Justin Jacobs
Av’E Editor
The day Stedeford’s‘ Records

I opened in Pittsburgh’s North Side in

1963, it brought in $53.84. And that
was a good day. . A
. Forty-ﬁve years later, the shop is a
synthesis of old and new—— the store-
ﬁont, with its wavy, retro lettering wel-
coming people inside, is underscored
by posters ﬂashing the newest rap
stars. Take a step into Stedeford’s and
you’ve entered a veritable rock’nroll
bazaar —— vinyls sit in crates along the
back walls, the center is taken over- by
racks loaded with CD5, cassette tapes
are stacked in a comer; Aside room
features classic jazz cuts long forgot-
ten; in one corner, you can even flip
through a collection of old ties
Random? Maybe, or maybe own-

er Doloris Stedeford’s just got an af-_

ﬁnity for Elvis Costello.

You’ll find a few copies of newer
releases, but you won’t discover whole
cases devoted to the latest platinum
seller. Customers walk slowly down
the aisles,  for unusual finds
and forgotten treasures, rarely leaving
with what theyfd set out to buy.

And though time seemstoistand

, still inside this Pittsburgh institution,

the tribulations of today are push-
ing Stedeford and her son, co—owner
Ron Stedeford, to face a harsh real-

‘ ity —— people just aren’t buying CD3

like they used to. Especially not from

small, independently run music
stores. _ ' ' "
‘Through the hard work of my
parents, they built the store up into_ a
very S1lCCCSSﬁ.1l money  busi-
ness,” said Ron Stedeford, his shaggy
gray hair pushed away from his eyes

He paused, just for a moment. "Until

recently”. ,
While the notion of . struggling
businesses in today’s market is certain-
ly no surprising topic, few industries
have quite so many factors stacked
against them than the indepen-
dent record store. Thexeconomy, of
course, is struggling like it has rarely
before But beyond that, independent
record stores are against the
growing sales of music online, the il-
legal downloading that eliminates the
need for music sales altogether and
the corporate  that have nearly
monopolized in-store music selling.
But Ron Stedeford plans to go

. down with the ship, that he’s put his

life’s work into. He speaks frankly, his
tone conveys that it’s too late to turn
back _

“Our best days are behind us.”

by Sam Stahl i
Staﬂ EV/‘iter

In the bleakest depths of winter, Pitts~
burghers often crave a climate change.
They long to leave the slushy streets and
gray skies behind in search of someplace

vwarmer, someplace brighter.

Pitt professor and critically acclaimed
author, editor and Vanity Fair—described
“Godfather behind creative nonﬁction,”
Lee Gutkind, will do just that this Janu-

, ary. Warmer weather and a new job await

him in Tempe, Ariz., where he will be a

professor and Distinguished Writer in

Residence at Arizona State University. _
ASU will provide the support that Pitt‘

[never gave to Gutkind for his journal,

Creative Nonfiction, which he started 15

years ago. ,

“I started the ﬁrst creative nonﬁction
MFA program and I. thought, ‘\Wouldn’t
it be wonderful" to start the ﬁrst creative
nonﬁction journal at the same time?’” said
Gutkind.‘ “But the University wou_ldn’t
support it, so I got annoyed and started
it on my own. Some former Pitt Newsers
and students helped me out. We needed
a literary journal to support this growing
genre.”  '

vAs the genre rapidly-expands, many
readers struggle to grasp its multifaceted
deﬁnition. In his introduction to the lat-
est issue of Creative Nonfiction, Gutkind
writes that it is “a way of writing that

combines relevant and enlightening infor—’
mation (journalism), with ideas presented’

iGutkind's journal

looks at Pittsburgh

by Sam Stahl
I Staff l»VI’L.l'eI‘

As the city celebrates its 250th anniversary,
it seems there is more art seeping from the ce-
ment and steel than ever before. In honor of
this year’s celebration, Editor Lee Gutkind and
his staff decided to theme their most recent is-
lsue-of literary journal Creative Nonfiction as
}j“Pittsburgh in Words.”

From more than 60 proposals, the journal
commissioned seven emerging “writers, each
 a story to tell about Pittsburgh.

“These captured the essence of the city'and
gave‘ different viewpoints. We have the old-
fashioned view, the traditional Pittsburgh that

I one likes to talk about. We also included

, pieces that are critical of thecity. Some people

' .want us to hide bad parts of the city, but we

T:didn’t want to do that We have a good spread

' ':of positive and not so positive,” said Gutkind.

 One featured author is Elena Passarello, a

 graduate originally from Georgia. In her
fﬁessay “Double Joy:

“We got a foundation grant to help emerg-
ing writers, so we mentored them the whole
way through after selecting their proposals.
Hattie Fletcher [managing editor at CNF] did
it all herself. These are writers who are growing
who could use the help.”

“The mentoring was a great process,” said
Mark Kramer, author of “I_rnmigrant Stories,”
another essay from the issue. “I’ve written
pieces before where there was dialogue with
the editor, a few drafts here and there, but
never from start to ﬁnishf Hattie Fletcher gave
good, very direct feedback but was also open
to my reasoning and why I wanted to do what
I was doing. It was interesting to get such heavy
feedback but still feel like the piece was your
own.” .

Kramer, a Pitt l\/[FA candidate, wrote “Im-
migrant Stories” about the owners and visitors
of Tana Ethiopian Cuisine restaurant in East
Liberty, and the difficulty of immigrating to a
city as homogenous as Pittsburgh.

' “My son is ad-

'jl\/lyron Cope and the
_ {Pittsburgh Soun ,”

'  as well as
her move to the city
and experience with
its sounds.

issue.

“Pittsburgh in Words” extends far past’
the pages of the magazine. An adjoining Web
site, pittsburghinwordsorg, was also formed to
showcase many other stories about Pittsburgh
by well-known writers like Annie Dillard and
John Edgar Widernan. I
Gutkind explained, “We got a grant from
The Heinz Endowments and wanted to show
that people have written interesting, in depth
things about Pittsburgh for a long time. We
also wanted to show that the genre has been

around for awhile —— it’s a new name but not ‘

Gutkind had advice for other aspiring non-
fiction authors. : .

He recommends two  “First, read the
best writers as often as you can and understand
what they’re doing. Second, act locally — write
about what’s around you — but think globally.
Write about  that people care about ev-
erywhere, making impact on as big an audience
as possible.” -

Margot and the Nuclear So

 

by Larissa Gula
Staﬂ Writer

Not Animal

Margot and the Nuclear So & So's
Epic Records

Rocks like: Arcade Fire, Snow
Patrol

Playing Dec. 19 at Brillobox

 

Meaningful lyrics and Variety in its musi-

 style can make a good album, but hate
ifeferences to alcohol and body parts can

‘break it. _
Not Animal, released by Margot and the
Nuclear So &'So’s, carries both of the above.
The band is one of the few that calls on de-
tailed, realistic situations while still making
depression sound gorgeous.
"V Margot and the Nuclear So & So’s is a
different sort of band. The name is lengthy.
Founders Richard__'Edwards and Andy Fry
met in a pet store. The list of instruments
the two play includes guitar, bells, bass, syn-
thesizer, lap steel, melodica, banjo and per-
cussion. That doesn’t even include the other
two members, Emily and Tyler W/atkins.
A To say each song’s background changes
is an understatement. This band gets kudos
for its variety and its originality. In addition
to a lengthy list of instruments, electric gui-

tar, a harmonica and string instruments ap-

peared.

A Overall, the band resembles The Shins
and Arcade Fire. Indie—rock bashers, please

reins, because they deserve it.

The 12 album tracks include titles such
as “Pages \Written on a \X/all,” “The Shivers”
and “The Ocean, (is Bleeding Salt).” Each
track offers a different take on music.

“Broadripple is Burning” has a child fo-
cus. This one is like a depressing fairy tale.
Like, time to drop profanity to the children
mentioned at the beginning of the song,
right along with a “being wasted” part. Yet,
it’s gorgeous and poetic.

“Cold, Kind and Lemon Eyes” is about
one drunken family and how the vocal-
ist would go cold just to be left alone. His
words, though, sound better than that:
“Please don’t drop bombs on me / I beg of
thee, just leave me in peace / I’ll have cold,
kind, and lemon eyes / Oh lemon eyes. My
God!” i _ ‘

“As Tall as Cliffs” is the most popular
of the album tracks on iTunes for a reason.
It has the: relationship—gone—bad feeling,
although I,Vdon’t remember the last time I
heard bad relationships put this way: “You’1l
hang like the rest. / We’ll leave a noose on
the attorney’s desk / And take to the streets
/ Chant like an army / And doctor up this
disease.”

After the list of slightly depressing songs,
it’s odd to hear “Stopcrying and start smil-
ing” on the last track of the album.

However, that seems to be the point.
Everyone in the songs’ tales is alive despite
their problems. The bestlway to improve a
situation is to smile and keep going. i

I Gutkind, a Pitt graduate himself, start-

f¥ed the world’s first creative nonﬁction

:MFA program at Pitt in 1993. He later

{went onto begin-the Creative Nonﬁction

Pitt’s writing program and the Mid—Atlan—

 the genre is an understatement.

E Unfortunately, the enthusiasm

;? Gutkind possesses isn’t always appreci-

ated by the city. ’

 “There isn’t support-. Writers aren’t
valued here. Pittsburgh is a great place
to write, not a great place to be a writer,”

¢; said Gutkind. '

“This is a_ city still ﬁghting to‘ stay

 alive. It’s not prospering in any great de-

gree. The city is in ﬂux, so consequently

the arts are in ﬂux,” said Gutkind,_as he
 went on to cite more challenges the ,cre-
ative-tcommunity faces.

“‘For instance, my best students leave
town. There isn’t an active publishing
world here. There are four groups of

of the tuna experiment, I went on to try the
spicy tuna roll. A good spicy tuna roll has a
bit of kick. Japanese mayonnaise should coat
cubed tuna and scallion and be juxtaposed
against a crisp cucumber stick. The key to suc-
cess is less rice, more tuna. No
one is paying for rice.

The tuna was almost textureless, having
been almost smothered into a puree. There was
barely any kick to it, and the rice to tuna ratio
was something like 10 to one. 7

Pitt prepares for new athletic complex
Teams rejoice with 
plans of better facilities

Spring 0,/"2010 earliest for Sites

by Jay Huerbin
Staff Writer

For Pitt’s baseball, softball,

- soccer and track and ﬁeld teams,

it’s about time.

Pitt’s Board of Trustee’s Prop-
erty ancl Facilities Committee
unanimously decided Nov. 7 to
purchase land behind Trees Hall
for the construction of a new
Olympic sports complex for Pitt
athletics. '

Construction has started on
the 12.5—acre site, said University
spokesman John Fedele. ~

The University selected the

construction management ﬁrm
 Dick Inc. through a bidding
process. Once a final design is
.&_ompleted,  Dick will create a

ﬁnal package and send out infor-
mation to different contractors.
Like the ﬁrm, these contractors
will also be selected through a

bidding process.

E5’:-f’


"Theinew facilities will
provide those teams with
modern, on—carnpus facilities,
which will help them compete
with their peers and with

recruiting."  
John Fedele

Ofﬁcials from the Pittsburgh-
« based  Dick company declined
to comment on their upcoming

project. ,

Pitt athletics spokesman 
Borghetti said that in the early
stages of the planning, there
would be no comment from the
athletic department.

\While the initial site work has

begun, there is still no ﬁnal design
for the complex. Currently,‘ the
ﬁelds are onlygoing through re-
conditioning and prepping so that
the complex can be built there. -
Pitt Executive Vice Chancel-
lor Jerome Cochran explained
that the earliest the ﬁelds could
be ready would be for the spring
of 2010, but everything is prelim-

inary because of the current ﬁ- _
nancial situations in the country. .

\X/hile sharing is nice, Divi-
sion-I‘ athletes deserve their own
space.‘ - _

Pitt’s soccer, baseball, softball
and track and ﬁeld teams have
been sharing facilities for the past
nine years — since the closure of
Pitt Stadium, which stood in up-
per campus on the spot where the
Petersen Events Center now is.

That’s all abouttto change. Or
at least it’ll get a lot better.

I “Since the removal of Pitt
Stadium, the plan has been to
build a new complex for the soc-

cer, baseball, softball and track
teams,” said Joe Luxbacher, Pitt
men’s soccer coach. 3

Unfortunately for the teams,
issues regarding the land 
dered progress toward obtaining

. new ﬁelds before now.

As of last month, Pitt’s p£an
is to build the sports complexltot
help out the soccer, baseball and
softball teams. ii

Upon completion of the new ‘

complex, the plan is to transfornit
the current baseball ‘ﬁeld into a
track.

“It’s been a long time comi-

ing,” said women’s soccer coach _ 1

by Emily Steiner
Staff Writer

Sunday marked another historic

event for the Pitt women’s basketball

 The Panthers ran away with an
upset over No. 8 Maryland, 86-57.

The game marked the biggest up-

set in the history of th in am. Last

year’s win over No. 9 Notre Dame in

the Big East tournament was previ— \

gusly the largest upset for the Pan-
thers 1
After seeing such a lopsided score
at theend, Pitt coach Agnus Berenato
atttibuted the win to great leadership
and intense preparation
xr. “There’s a saying that when op-
portunity meets preparation:_ you’re
success ” said Berenato. “And I
thought the team was very successful
today because we were very well—pre-
pared and we had the opportunity.”

No. 24 Pitt (6-1) with 26 points, and
fellow veteran Xenia Stewart tallied
Stewart, who was honored prior to

the game for scoring her 1,000th point
against Penn State, opened with an

early layup. Maryland’s Marissa Cole— -.

man quickly followed with two points
of her own. ‘

Sophomore Shayla Scott brought
the ball back  scoring three and
 Pitt a'5—2 lead. A jumper and a
layup by the Terrapins gave Maryland

‘ the advantage, 6-5.

All of this, and only two minutes
into the game,

\V1th the game tied at_12, Zellous

"initiated an 11-point scoring streak.
After turnovers from both sides, Zel-
lous scored ‘on a fast break The 
was quickly back in'_Pitt’s hands, and

Stewart hit a 3—pointer, giving Pitt a 7

_ Scott, Stewart ted Taneisha Har-
rison all scored, increasing Pitt’s lead to
11 before Maryland senior standout
Ktisti Toliver made a 3—pointer of her
own, gettingwithin eight at 23-15.

From there, Maryland went on

a scoring run of its own, scoring six

times before   the lead, '

26-25.

Buta ﬁnal 14-6 run, highlighted by
seven points from Sophronia Sallard,

Pitt to victory, Sun Bowl
First nine-winseason since 1982

by Kyle Craig
_ Staﬂ Writer
EAST HARTFORD, Conn.

— With representatives from the
Sun Bowl in attendance and the

bowl implications clear, the Pitt‘

defense provided the spark that
punched "the Panthers’ ticket to
El Paso.

The Panthers intercepted ﬁve
Connecticut pass attempts while
surrendering just six total Con-
necticut completions on their way
to a 34-10 win Saturday on the
Huskies’ senior day. Between two
quarterbacks, Tyler Lorenzen and
Zach Frazier, the Huskies went 6
of 31 in the passing game.

Saturday’s win gave Pitt (9-3,
5-2) its ﬁrst nine-win regular sea-
son since 1982. It also secured
a trip to the Sun Bowl on New
Year’s Eve. Dave Wannstedt’s first
bowl game as Pitt’s head coach is
a prestigious one.

After the game, Wannstedt
credited his players for playing
“like champions all year.” He also
highlighted the importance of
the victory for the program.

“Us [winning] nine games and
[topping] it off with an invitation
to the Sun Bowl, it’s a great day
for Pitt football,” said Wannst—
edt.

However, the game wasn’t al-
ways, as certain as the ﬁnal score
would indicate. At halftime, both
teams were knotted up in a de-
fensive struggle with a 3-3 score.
They remained tied until Pitt
tailback LeSean McCoy broke
free on a 47-yard touchdown run
through the heart of the Con-
necticut defense. ’

“It was a big play to kind of
give us a spark,” said McCoy.
“The [offensive] line did some
great blocking ‘today, especially
on that run. It was wide-open, I

think anyone could have ran and
made that touchdown.”

Pitt didn’t surrender the lead
for the remainder of the game.
Linebacker Greg Williams inter-
cepted a Lorenzen pass and re-
turned it inside the Connecticut
10-yard line on the next drive,
setting up a Conor Lee ﬁeld goal.

The Huskies responded with
a 57-yard touchdown run by the
NCAA’s leading rusher, Don-
ald Brown, cutting Pitt’s lead to
three. Brown ﬁnished the game
with 189 yards on 34 carries.

Despite Brown’s production,
Pitt quarterback Bill Stull came
alive in the second half. He helped
widen the lead with touchdown
strikes to receiver Derek Kinder
and tight end Nate Byham.

Although the play of both
running backs has been strong
throughout the year, Wannstedt
said he had a feeling the game

Process of getting land

most difficult for university

Complex, page 42

to think about is that from day-to-day, the
economic conditions in the country are
such that anything can happen,” said Co-
chran. “And when you’re talking about a
plfbject like this, [the timetable] is depen-
dent on the markets.”

Cochran also said that because Pitt is

in the early stages of design and develop- j

ment, an estimate of the ﬁnal cost cannot
be determined.

In a series of projects approved by the
committee, the land was purchased from
the Housing Authority of Pittsburgh for
$14.3 million.

The facility is part of a 12-year plan the
University implemented during the 2006-07
school year, Cochran said. The plan takes
into account the input of faculty, staff and
students to meet the needs of academic
and athletic concerns.

“This project has been in the making
for quite a long time,” said Cochran. ‘‘[It]
is meant to meet the need of the depart-

ment of athletics for its intercollegiate '

men’s baseball team, women’s softball, and
its men’s and women’s soccer teams.”

The plan also involves adding a three-
story support building for the new ﬁelds
and improving the area behind the Cost
Center for Pitt’s track and ﬁeld team.

Cochran said the current ﬁeld situation
for these teams is “inadequate” — as the
soccer teams play home games more than
15 miles away in Cheswick.

And because of the current travel in-
volved, Pitt’s main goal is to increase the
competition among Pitt athletics and in-
crease student attendance. Cochran also
said that these sports don’t currently have
facilities that either the NCAA or Big East
would ﬁnd suitable for conference and na-
tional championship games.

“The new facilities will provide those
teams with modern, on-campus facilities,
which will help them compete with their
peers and with recruiting,” said Fedele. “It
also will allow the student body better ac-
cess to the home games these teams play.”

Although the new ﬁelds will be on cam-
pus, Fedele said that at this early stage in
design there are no additional transporta-
tion plans from Lower to Upper Campus.

According to Fedele, the new facility
will be paid for by Pitt’s Education and
General Budget, private donations and ath-
letic revenues.

With the completion of the new ﬁelds,
Pitt plans to open up more space for the
rest of the students.

“By this project being completed, all
that space behind the Cost Center will be
opened up for much more access for in-
tramural activity,” said Cochran. “It really
will provide a signiﬁcant increase in the
amount of space available to the general
student body.”

Still in the beginning phases of plan-
ning, University ofﬁcials do not anticipate
any problems to occur during the construc-
tion of the complex. i

Cochran explained that the hardest part
was getting through “bureaucracy” to ac-
quire the land. And the University is ap-
proaching the plan with caution.

“It’s a long process between the need
to get this project through the city, the
city housing authority, the planning com-
mission, the zoning board [and] several
approvals by City Council,” said Cochran.
“And then the University has to constantly
update its master plan whenever they’re go-
ing to do a project. That master plan has to
go through the process.” '

But Cochran said that unlike acquiring
the land, the construction should not be
complicated.

Although the project might still be in
the early phases of development, anticipa-

- tion is still high for the University and the

athletic department.

“What it does for the programs has yet
to be seen,” said Cochran. “One hopes that
with the right facilities, teams can build a
successful program both from the stand-
point of recruiting and development of a
fanbase.”

is small, both teams play their
games at Founders Field — an
off—campus regulation ﬁeld also
shared by local soccer teams.

\X/hile Founders Field «is a nic-
er facility than Pitt’s on—campus
ﬁelds, it is about 30 minutes away
in Indianola.

“I honestly can’t tell you where

' Founders Field is located,” said

Kat Weﬂer, a sophomore on the
women’s soccer team. “It’s like 30
minutes away, and it doesn’t feel
like a home ﬁeld at all. Also, be-
cause it’s used by several teams,
the ﬁeld isn’t always in the best
condition.”

Because of the distance of '

Founders Field, the teams leave
for games more than two hours
before their start. Chin said this
will change.

“The installation of on—cam-
pus ﬁelds will signiﬁcantly cut
preparation time for games,” ex-
plained Chin. ‘

“Currently all treatments are

handled in the Field House, then
we are bused to the ﬁelds. We’re
leaving at around 4:45 p.m. for a 7

"p.m. game, and treatments aren’t

as effective by the time the game
starts.

ﬁeld also has limited the fan base
for both soccer teams.

“Depending on the weather,
we usually have about 100 to 150
people come to games,” said Boe-
hm. “I like the fan base at other
schools. It’s a lot different playing
in front of thousands.”

Although the soccer teams
only use the back ﬁeld for prac-
tice, the fact that the soccer,
baseball and softball teams have
access to the ﬁeld greatly limits
practice. times and gives certain
teams priority depending on the
season. ‘

During soccer season, the

baseball and softball ﬁelds are

transformed to accommodate the .

needs'of the soccer teams, result-

ing in the removal of the dugouts

and fences used by the teams.-
“In the fall, the soccer teams

have priority over the ﬁeld,” said ‘

Holly Aprile, the Panthers’ soft-
ball coach. “As a result we have to
practice early in the morning dur-

 

ing the fall, without dugouts and
the enclosure of a fence.”
According to Aprile, the
transformation of the ﬁeld not
only takes away a sense of per-
manence for the home ﬁeld, but
the removal of the fences creates
more work for the ioutﬁelders,
who sometimes have to run great
distances chasing after balls.
Another problem the softball
team faces year round is easy ac-
cess to the softball ﬁeld. , ‘
“Getting to our ﬁeld can be
somewhat of a difﬁculty,” 
sophomore pitcher Cory Berliner.
“There are two ways to get to our
ﬁeld. You can walk through
Cost Center, past the intramu-
ral ﬁelds and across the baseball
ﬁelds, or you have to drive down
Centre Avenue and come around
the back.”  ,
Like the soccer team,‘ the base;
ball and softball teams also have
limited fan bases.

,‘ people from athletics. Hopefully
5 the new complex will attract peo-
 ple to come check us out.”
Second—handedly beneﬁting
. from the new complex is the track

 and ﬁeld team, which doesn’t have V

 any fans at its competitions.

 

, “There are several chal1eng~
 es,” track and ﬁeld coach Alonzo
 Webb said about not having "a
ghome track. “The No. 1 is not
 having the convenience of prac-
ticing without displacing the
team.” _

Webb. “We all know that these-
things take time, so from the staff

to the athletes, we choose not to

dwell on things that are not in our

hands.

We just have to keep our nose
to the grindstone and control
what we can.”

Under the leadership of Webb,
the track and field team has been
notably successful, winning the 
Big East Championship in 2005. I

Like Webb and the mem-
bers of the track and ﬁeld team,
coaches and athletes are excited
about the new plans, but until
then, they’re making the best of
what they have.

“Not having a ﬁeld wasn’t a
big factor for me. I just deal with
it,” said Weﬂer. “I do like the idea
of having a stadium and nice
ﬁelds on campus, because that’s
the first thing I notice at other
schools. Hopefully, we’ll have one
by time I graduate.”

up the weight room and cardio ma-

a meal-replacement shake for lunch.
Although most of what he con-
sumed was liquid, he ate small snacks
of fruit or nuts throughout the day to
keep his energy up. For dinner, Kru-
kar grabbed a power bar to complete
