GB elections .

race begins
with Meet the
Candidates

And they're off ...

By Melissa Blackwood
and Kevin Kramer
The Pitt News

The presidential candidates for the
upcoming year’s Student Government
Board said that they want to make sure
student interests are included in Pitt’s
plans for the future.

At last night’s Meet The Candidates, one
week before the elections, they outlined
the areas they wanted to see_ included in
the university’s Master Space Plan.

The plan is a five-year project that
includes goals for the future of all univer-
sity buildings. ’

Presidential candidate Chris Fedeli
focused on three areas which he said he
feels the plan does not adequately address,
the most important being on-campus hous-
ing. .

“Currently, the university can only guar-
antee residence housing for freshmen and
sophomores. This means many students
who would like to live on campus have to
move off.”

Fedeli suggested that the old Burger
King on Fifth Avenue, which currently is
empty, could be turned into an additional
residence hall.

In addition to housing, Fedeli said he
wanted to see Pitt expand its lower cam-
pus recreational athletic facilities.

“As we all know, walking up to Trees
Hall is exercise in itself,” Fedeli joked.

Presidential candidate Heath Golden
said he also sees the necessity of a new
recreational facility. “We are going to
make a modern athletic facility on the

lower campus with a weight room the size

Forum held
to discuss
Pitt Master

Space Plan

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt must keep trying
to solve student housing
problems, going beyond
the recommendations includ-

ed in Pitt’s Master Space

Plan, according to Jim
DeAngelis, co—chair of the
committee that developed
the plan.

The plan, which docments
Pitt’s short—range, mid-range
and long-range construction
goals, “brings together the
best thinking at this time ..
[but] this is a never-ending
task,” said DeAngelis, co-
chair of the Senate Plant
Utilization and Planning
Committee, or PUP.

DeAngelis mediated yes-
terday at an open forum
which provided an opportu-
nity for students, faculty and
staff to discuss the Master
Space Plan.

According to the plan, the
university needs 1800 beds
for undergraduates and
400 for graduate students.
Pitt plans to build an
undergraduate 200-bed dor-
mitory on the hillside within
the next five years and an
800-bed facility within the
next ten years, but it does
not have any specific plans
for graduate housing.

“We’d like to be consid-
ered in that hillside plan,”
said» Shakura Sabur of the
Graduate and Professional
Student Association (GSPA.)
Sabur said the recommenda-
tion for 400 new beds for
graduate students is not
enough.

“These students are won-
dering whether they will rec-
ommend to other friends to
study here, because housing
is such, a problem,” Sabur

SEAC teaches and learns at regional conference

By Chris Lombardo
For The Pia News

Pitt Student Environmental
Action Coalition members
traveled to Millersville
University last weekend to
learn what other SEAC chap-
ters know about educating and
fighting for environmental
action.

About 40 members repre-
senting eight Pennsylvania

colleges joined Mi1lersville’s

environmental group, Priority,_

for a weekend that included
hikes,‘ dancing and many
workshops.

Pitt SEAC,member Matt
Peters held his own workshop
on Saturday to educate about
the Allegheny Defense
Project, the main project focus
of the local chapter. .

“The workshop on the ADP
was highly successful. Many

members were aware of the
logging problem in the
Allegheny Forest, but I think I
helped to illustrate just how
devastating timber extraction
can be to the forest,” Peters
said.

Peters included in his pre-
sentation a series of slides that
were taken of areas marked for
clearcuts. The pictures were
taken in the summer of 1993
to illustrate the beauty of the

forest, but they demonstrated
much more, according to
Peters.

Peters said the areas pho-
tographed just over a year ago
are completely cleared of tim-
ber and plowed through with
logging roads.

“Showing pictures knowing
that those areas have been
wiped-out made many mem-

bers realize the importance of

ASSIUT, Egypt — More than
130 people were killed in storms
in Southern Egypt on
Wednesday, including dozens
who perished in a sea of blazing
fuel after lightening struck a mil-
itary fuel complex, sources ofﬁ-
cials said.

They said rescueteams had
pulled 69 bodies from charred
houses in Dronka, 200 miles
south of Cairo, site of the com-
plex. Another 63 died from
ﬂooding in southern provinces.

More than 200 houses in
Dronka were destroyed by blaz-
ing water and at least 20,000 ter-
rified townsfolk crowded onto
roads to the provincial capital of
Assiut.— Reuters

OTTAWA — Two homosexuals
asked Canada’s Supreme Court
Tuesday to give them the same
governmental beneﬁts as hetero-
sexual couples in a landmark
challenge under the country’s
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

James Egan and John “Jack”
Nesbit,‘who have lived together
for 46 years, said they should be
considered the same as other
spouses so Nesbit can receive a
federal pension beneﬁt.

It challenges the Canadian
government who says only a
man and a woman can be con-
sidered spouses. —— Reuters

PARIS — Parisian bus drivers
staged a one-day strike on
Wednesday after one of their
colleagues was attacked with a
syringe infected with the AIDS
virus.

The strikers are demanding
tighter security measures includ-
ing special cabins for drivers and
a second transport official in
buses.

The stoppage was in protest at
an incident in the suburb of
Saint—Gratien last Thursday in
which an attacker threatened a
bus driver and then jabbed him
with the infected syringe. —

UNION, S.C. — David and
Susan Smith, the parents of two
young boys allegedly kidnapped
during a carjacking, made a
heartfelt plea for their return, as
investigators looking for
Michael, 3, and Alex, 1, hit a
snag in their efforts to locate
them.

The news conference followed
remarks by Union County
Sheriff Howard Wells, who said
a lead that looked very promis-

~ ing earlier in the day had failed

to pan out.

Susan Smith said last week a
man entered her car at a traffic
light and forced her at gunpoint
to drive to the outskirts of town.
She was then forced from the car
while the man drove off with her

SAN FRANCISCO — Union
workers at the city’s two main
daily newspapers, The San
Francisco Chronicle and The
San Francisco Examiner,
walked picket lines Wednesday.
Some 2,600 union workers

went on strike Tuesday night
after marathon contract talks
with management finally
reached an impasse, labor ofﬁ-
cials said.

“The employers left us no
choice. At almost every turn,
they rejected our requests for a
fair wage and job security of the

WASHINGTON -— Federal
officials now believe the man
accused of firing on the White
House Saturday planned to kill
President Clinton and are con-
sidering charging him with
attempted assassination, The
Washington‘ Post reported
Wednesday.

The Post, quoting sources
close to the investigation, said
law enforcement officials based
their new view of the situation
on further evidence found in the
truck of Francisco Duran’s car
and an FBI interview with one
of his co-workers.

The paper said ofﬁcials found
a map with the words “kill the
[prez]” written on it, although it
said the exact spelling of the
abbreviation of the word presi-
dent could not be determined.
Sources also told the paper
handwritten notes recovered

‘Night hawks’ on the prowl ...

Toke Cl wild ride around campus with Pitt Public Safety officers

By Mark Gordon

News Assistant

(Editor’s note: Last Saturday night
News Assistant Mark Gordon and
Managing Editor Matt Serlin rode
around with campus police Officer
Eric Holmes.)

The carpet covering the ﬂoor of the
room was a worn out, darkish blue.

all dressed in a similar shade of blue
were standing around; some eating,
some talking and one was smoking. It
was a little after 11 p.m., and for Pitt’s
campus police, the night shift was
about to begin.

Officer Curtis Smith referred to the
night guard as the “night hawks.” He
left the briefing room to begin walk-
ing his beat, and soon after that we
met our officer for the night, Eric
Holmes.

He led us to his squad car, and after
checking the sirens and the radio to

make sure they worked properly, we
were off to patrol the streets of
Oakland.

Holmes is a new police officer
at Pitt. He was just hired in May,
and his co—workers still affection-
ately call him the “rookie.” He
graduated from Slippery Rock
University and worked a security
internship at the White House. He
told Matt and I stories about protect-

car roared to life. The gas pedal was
floored, and a quick right, sharp left
and about 10 seconds later we were
cruising up and down the streets of
South Oakland.

Holmes’ eyes moved everywhere,
but there was nothing to be seen. He
pulled to a stop behind Forbes Hall
and began to file a report on the inci-
dent. He pulled back out into traffic
and continued patrolling.

the Forbes Quad garage and began our

11:33 p.m. —— We were driving delib-

about to pass the Chevron Building,
when a female voice came over the
radio.

“Disturbance on South Bouquet and

breaking into cars,” she said.

right hand and the sirens on top of the

"Matt Serlin/Staff Photographer

11:57 p.m. —- Holmes slowly looked
over the area by Pitt Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor’s house, on
Devonshire Street, when a male voice
crackled over the radio that there was
a blue Monte Carlo being broken into
outside Hillman Library. ‘

Holmes ﬂipped the switch and the
sirens squealed again.

He peeled out onto Fifth Avenue
and dropped his foot to the ﬂoor. Our
sirens blared as we picked up speed,

approaching 60 miles per hour, but a
small red sports car was in our way.
Holmes slowly applied the brakes as
the car finally pulled out of our way.
He hit the gas, made a left onto
Bigelow Boulevard and we cruised
down Clemente Drive, searching for
the suspect. We were met by Officer
Keifer, who told us the incident had
moved to the Cathedral of Learning.
Holmes quickly turned around and
pulled up right behind three other
squad cars with their lights flashing. A
few officers were attempting to appre-
hend the suspect, when the man got
loose and ran towards the cathedral. A
foot chase ensued with some of the
officers, but Holmes jumped back in
his car and ﬂew back down Bigelow.
He made a sharp right turn into the
bus lane on Fifth, cars coming at us in
all the other lanes. Next was a right
turn onto Bellefield, and cars were
coming at us in all available lanes.
Holmes keenly avoided the PAT Bus
that was coming head on and swerved
onto Forbes, still going the wrong
way. He screeched to a stop, as Public
Safety officers chased down the sus-
pect on the cathedral lawn.

The suspect was handcuffed, read
his rights and transported to the public
safety building. Holmes and the other
“night hawks” on the scene gave each
other high fives and then it was back
to the streets.

12:48 a.m. —- We pulled into the
Schenley Quadrangle and Holmes
spied a girl walking around a win-
dowsill outside of Holland Hall South.
Holmes informed the Resident
Director on duty, and we began to get
back into the car when Holmes heard
an officer calling for help in the union.
We ran through the parking lot and
straight into the ballroom, where a
dance was taking place.

Nine police officers converged on
the scene and found the victim lying
on the floor with  a charlie horse.
We got back into the car, and Holmes
explained to us that an officer yelled
for help over the radio, meaning you
have to respond as fast as possible,
even though the situation might not be
life-threatening.

Forum

said.

The committee heard fur-
ther suggestions from GSPA
regarding graduate housing,
said Thomas Anderson, co—
chair of PUP. Regardless of
whether these suggestions
end up in the Master Space
Plan, committee members
should continue to examine
the problem, DeAngelis said.

The Master Space Plan
also does not specifically
address the problem of
undergraduate students
spreading out into neighbor-
hoods surrounding Oakland,
which could cause conflict
with community residents in
those areas, DeAngelis said.

More full-time undergradu-
ate students live in the south-
ern part of Squirrel Hill than
in central Oakland, he said.
Residents fear an
“Oaklandifying” of Squirrel
Hill.

This is an important city-
wide issue, DeAngelis said.
Oakland residents also want
to engage the city in making
the university more responsi-
ble for students who live off-
campus in slum conditions or
who have irresponsible land-
lords, said Martha Garvey of
Oakland Directions Inc.

Participants at the forum

also discussed recommenda-
tions included in the Master
Space Plan to close Bigelow
Boulevard to traffic, which
would enable pedestrians to
walk from the Cathedral of
Learning to the William Pitt
Union without having to
contend with traffic.

But some in city govern-
ment and in the community
do not support closing roads,
so Pitt doesn’t have any con-
crete plans to do this,
DeAngelis said.

Suggestions like this
are reflections of the uni-
versity’s hopes for the future,
said Ana Guzman, a PUP
committee member. The plan
makes the city and county
aware that “this is important
to the university,” she said.

The plan also describes
plans to add to Hillman
Library and to begin renovat-
ing stadium facilities within
the next five years.

The plan is “a living docu-
ment,” Guzman said "when
she presented the contents of
the plan at the beginning of
the forum. “This is not some-
thing to be followed to the
letter for the next 20 years.”

Over the next two weeks,
the Master Space Plan will
be finalized to be submitted
to the city, DeAngelis said.

William Pitt Union ballroom, where the
forum took place.

In accordance with his platform, Golden
said he wants to make plans for_ redoing
Trees Hall and Fitzgerald Field House take
place.

Though presidential candidate Julie
Crowell did not focus on the university's
Master Space Plan, she said she advocated
campus change in

they were very enthusiastic about forming an
alliance.

Another focus in her platform for presiden-
cy dealt with campus safety, and she said she
has worked toward creating a student escort
service.

“Up until now, an escort service has been a
bad word. It’s been pushed in the too—hard-
to-do pile. But beginning next semester, an
escort service will be available on a trial

basis.”
Like Crowell, many

a different way.

Through the cre-
ation of a Community
Relations Committee,
she said she wants
students to become
involved in the
Oakland community,
which will in turn
lead to greater par-
ticipation with the
SGB.

“A lot of students do

 

of the candidates
for the SGB
focused on student
safety. Increased
lighting and more
emergency phones
on campus were
two popular solu-
tions.

While the candi-
dates said they were
pleased that approxi-
mately 200 students

not know what student
government is about,” said Crowell. “My
goal is to include you in the government
process.”

In addition to Oakland students, Crowell
said she wants to integrate more effectively
the students of all the University of
Pittsburgh branch campuses.

“Penn State has 19 branch campuses which
meet once or twice a month. Right now,
Pitt’s campuses meet once or twice a semes-
ter.” 4
Crowell has already spoken with members
of branch student governments and said that

showed up for
last night’s forum, many had anticipated
more questions and greater audience partici-
pation.

Other board candidates included Jane
Berger, John Callahan, Keith Campbell, Julie
Clouse, Patrick Huey, Mark Hughes,
Creighton Moorehead, David Potter and Paul
Ufberg.

(Editor’s note: There will be a story about
the SGB board candidates in Monday’s The

immediate action,” Peters
said.

Member Susan Curry
attended a workshop about
student mug programs on
campus and the purchasing of
“green” products by schools.

“Mug programs are really
effective. Other schools use
them and they've proven to be
successful,” Curry said.

Mug programs call for stu-
dents to use plastic mugs
when dining at on-campus
facilities that normally use
paper or plastic cups. The
mugs belong to the students
and can be reused. Tons of
trees can be saved each year,
according to Curry.

She said she plans to gather
support and inquire about
such a program here at Pitt.

Curry said the workshop
also taught her how to work
with the university to make a
difference and illustrate that
being environmentally con-
scious is beneficial to the
school.

For example, Curry said by
installing high-efficiency
water spouts on sinks and
showers around campus, Pitt
could save enough money in
water bills in one year to pay
back the installation costs.

Curry said she hopes com-
municating with university
officials about the money they
can save will make them lis-
ten more carefully.

The voice was a Pitt police
officer who was inside Pitt
Stadium, where he spotted
two individuals climb over
the scoreboard and into the
seats. The pair were going to
have a surprise waiting for
them when they got down —
Pitt Public Safety officers.

The pair began to climb out
of the stadium when one per-
son looked up and saw
Officer Diven, a towering
man who looked even bigger
standing on top of the Pitt
Stadium scoreboard. He told
them to climb slowly down
the fence.

When the pair reached the
ground, they began to explain
why they were in Pitt Stadium
at 1:15 a.m. One said they
both were from Michigan and
they wanted to see the stadi-
um. While some officers
stayed to ponder the explana-
tion, we jumped back into the
squad car.

Holmes also said that on his
days off, sometimes he has to
follow up cases by making
phone calls and talking to vic-
tims.

Dwight put up a little resis-
tance, but eventually he
agreed. Only he insisted
that he park the car him-

self because the brakes were
old.

Diven hesitantly agreed,
and he and Holmes blocked
off Fifth Avenue as Dwight

 

inscribed on it.

The man was standing on
the sidewalk with his arms
extended and his left foot sus-
pended in the air. Matt and I
came to the conclusion that
this man was being given a

brick in his left hand. The
person had a very determined
look on his face, and people
were standing around him
saying, “Just give it up Billy,
give it up.”

Holmes called for backup
and leaped out of the car, his
hand on his nightstick.

“Put down the bricks,”
Holmes said as he pushed the
individual into a wall. Holmes
said it one more time, and the
individual dropped the bricks
and began to talk about how
he was only protecting him-
self.

As the individual with the
bricks was talking, a crowd
started to gather around, and
at about the same time, the
backup arrived. In a matter of
seconds the situation returned
to normal, and we were on
our way. A l '

2:54 a.m. — Holmes drove us
back to the station in Forbes
Quad and, exhausted, we
climbed into Matt’s car to
head home. We had driven
around with Holmes for about
four hours — only half of his
daily shift — but long enough
to realize that “night hawks”
are out there ready to serve
and protect.

Opinions
Vote for Wolfo rcl

Pennsylvania has witnessed one of the hardest-fought and most
important Senatorial. campaigns in the country. The Pitt News
endorses the re-election of Democratic Senator Harris Wofford.

Wofford was elected in 1991 to bring change and health care to
this nation. Three years hardly provides enough time to enact that
change, and Wofford deserves another term in which to accomplish
his goals. .

In contrast, his opponent, Republican Congressman Rick
Santorum, appears to want to take this nation backwards. He wants
to go back to the failed policies of the Reagan-Bush administration.
Santorum is a far-right ideologue who is in lock step with right—wing
hacks Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole. p

Santorum, in a vicious and inaccurate ad campaign, has portrayed
Senator Wofford as a ﬂaming liberal. This is patently false. Indeed,
Wofford has demonstrated his independence and moderatism, simi-
larly to past Pennsylvania senators such as John Heinz. Wofford is in
favor of substantial welfare reform; supports tougher crime laws,
middle class tax cuts and a woman’s right to choose; and is against a
Canadian-style single-payer health care system.

Santorum, on the other hand, is in favor of unnecessary military
increases and has played a signiﬁcant part in the Republican strategy
of gridlock. He is in lock step with the far right of the Republican
party as well as with the National Riﬂe Association and the National
Right to Life Coalition. He even had the audacity to vote against
ﬂood relief while representing the Pittsburgh Three Rivers area.

The choice is clear. Wofford is a candidate who will work for and
represent the state of Pennsylvania as well as promote a gentler, fair-
er nation. Slick Rick Santorum represents only himself and his far-
right mentors. He is in favor of gridlock and voodoo economics. As
Teresa Heinz said, “Rick Santorum is the anti-thesis of John Heinz.”

On Tuesday Nov. 8, vote Harris Wofford for U.S. Senate.

Singel for governor

Pennsylvania’s gubernatorial race has been noted mostly for the
lack of interest it has engendered, its ridiculous negative campaign

ads and the similarity of the candidates. However, noting all this,

The Pitt News endorses the Democratic candidate, Mark Singel, for
Governor.

One of the key issues in the campaign has been crime, with
Singel’s opponent Republican Tom Ridge portraying Singel as soft
on this issue. However, the basis for this argument was the commut-
ed sentence of one criminal who committed violent crime after his
re-entrance into society.

Singel is hardly soft on crime, though. He favors “Three Strikes
and You’re Out” and an assault weapons ban. Ridge, on the other
hand, spent far more time childishly lashing out at Singel rather than
building a constructive platform. Indeed, Ridge would emasculate
Pennsylvania’s environmental protection agencies if elected.

While the choice is less clear than in the senatorial race, The Pitt
News encourages voters to cast their ballot for Mark Singel on Nov.
8.

Football column

I’m writing to tell you how
offended I wass when I read
the sports article, “Have
a smoke, it feels good”
by columnist Sean Duncan. I
love football, and when I
picked up The Pitt News, I was
hoping to read an article relay-
ing the major highlights of
Saturday’s winning game. I
was disgusted to find the arti-
cle begin with a very unsuit-
able analogy (“Like a virgin
being infiltrated for the first
time ...”) for a long overdue
football win.

I could go into detail about
how Sean is a pig, or how
unsuitable this kind of writing
is for any newspaper that
wants to establish itself as a
credible, intelligent newspa-
per. But the bottom line is that
it comes down to one simple
thing. It is the editor’s job to
make sure this kind of trash
stays out of the paper.

Gl'ClHll‘l

Walking anywhere these
days, I notice graffiti on side-
walks, mailboxes, windows,
walls and trees. Of course, the
list goes on. This fruitless
defacement of property is
in no way justified. Such van-
dalism represents ignorance
and insensitivity —— unrelated
to gay rights, rape issues or
any other cause those guilty
may consider worthy of pro-
motion.

Disturbed at the proliferation
of graffiti of all types (nonsen-
sical writings, tagging, politi-
cal and social alike), I am trou-
bled most by slogans of social
issues. I feel such behavior
serves not to shed light on the
cause but to discredit it.
Surely, I’ve observed the
“Real men don’t rape,” “Stop
racism,” ‘‘I’m gay and I'm

your roommate,” “Abortion
kills” and a multitude of others
over the course of the years.
Although I view this unsightly
permanence as burdening,

I wish to make it clear I am
not personally opposed by
those organization nor am I
attempting to deprive individ-
uals of their human rights.

‘However, I am aware that

one’s actions should not
infringe upon the rights of oth-
ers. With this in mind, I am
forced to look upon those van-
dals. Should these perpetrators
find the need to exercise their
freedom of speech, it would be
best to adhere to the advice of
one writer who suggested the
use of posters.

Posters are not only more
appropriate but far more pro-
ductive. When you want to get
a point across, don’t offend
others in the process.
Offending people only results
in counter-productivity. You’ll
be surprised at how more
receptive others will be to
your case once you take a con-
structive approach.

Cuba embargo

Enough already?

With the Communist threat
to world democracy gone
for five years,.America’s
strangling embargo on Cuba is
an embarrassing remnant
of an outdated policy. This
policy unjustly causes mil-
lions of Cubans to live in dire
poverty, directly threatening
their lives. Recently the
United Nations passed a reso-
lution condemning our policy.
The vote was a resounding
101 to 2. Even our closest
allies like Canada, France,
Denmark and, ironically, Haiti
voted against our imperialist
policy.

The United Nations has
unsuccessfully tried to pass
this resolution for a couple

of years. The support of our
allies (or lack of opposition)

which we had enjoyed has _

eroded. Israel is the only
country in the world that stood
by Washington at the
UN General Assembly vote.
The United Nations has

always cited Castro’s human.

rights record as the rationale
for continuing the embargo 
while more violent and auto-
cratic regimes in El Salvador,
Guatemala, China, etc. do
not seem to bother us. It’s
time we act on UN resolu-
tions, it’s time we end this
brutal policy.

Editorial mistake

, In reference to the editorial
board's editorial “Students
don’t show up” (Nov. 1,
1994), I would like to take
this opportunity to provide

‘the editorial board with the

following information.

The Student Government
Board has sponsored one
open forum this term. It was
held on Monday, Oct. 17 in
639 WPU and was advertised
in The Pitt News that day. No
students were in attendance,
which was unfortunate. This
program resulted from the
SGB President-For-A-Day
project.

The SGB has sponsored no
open forums since the one
held on Oct. 17. I assure that
if we had, it would have been
sufficiently advertised.

Asserting that “SGB really
needs to do a better job
advertising their open
forums” might be true — if
we held an open forum and
did not advertise it. Since we
held no open forum on
Thursday, as stated in the edi-
torial, advcrtisements for one
are not an issue.

SPECIAL PREMIERES

The Boys of St. Vincent

Directed by John N. Smith

Extreme censorship problems delayed
the Canadian broadcast debut of this
sensitive look at the incendiary topic of
this film, which is partially based on
events in a Newfoundland orphanage.
Despite the subject matter, Boys is less
about pedophilia and the Catholic
Church, and more about the abuses of
power, the absence of moral account-
ability and the destructive tendencies of
organizations to close ranks and pro-
tect themselves at any cost

The New Age

Directed by Michael Tolkin

Judy Davis and Peter Weller star as
two cold-eyed wealthy hypersophisti-
cates on a downward spiral. Once
laced with the loss of their Architecture
Digest house-to-die-for, Davis and
Weller begin to question the meaning
of life and in response open a bour-
geois luxury boutique named
Hypocrisy. Tolkin wrote the The Player,

Ah  those first dates —— they can be
the best of times or the worst. Noonan
gives a little of both in this “date movie”
that goes for substance, not surface. it
involves, of course, a couple on their
first date and deals with the potential
awkwardness or enjoyment in dress,
conversation and getting to know
someone. i

Directed by Rachel Liebling
Celebrating the evolution of bluegrass
music, which emerged in the 1940s as
a fusion of Southern folk music, jazz
and swing, High Lonesome offers more

 

than 100 musical recordings to go
along with interviews, performances,

film traces the bluegrass legacy via Bill

Directed by Caveh Zahedi

A film that opens with its director direct-
ly addressing the camera, “This film is
an experiment in faith, an attempt to
prove the existence ofrGod,” should
surely give audiences high expecta-
tions. His premise is that, if God is all
powerfu|,then she/he will see to it that
the unscripted, underfunded film will be
entertaining and fulfill those expecta-
tions. When it appears that no miracle
or sign from chief is coming, Zahedi
tries to convince his fatherj and brother
to take the drug ecstasy with him in an
effort to salvage the film. 1

Natrona Heights native and CMU grad-
uate Michael Kaniecki not only stars in

also co-wrote the screenplay and wrote
and performed most of the soundtrack.
Kaniecki plays Charles, an underem-
ployed singer/songwriter/videotape edi-
tor who hopes that videotaping his life

A film about the so-called “shit genera-
tion,” we get a story about London and
M-16, two teens trying to be in love and
lose their virginity. London’s mom is a
pill-popping tramp, her brother a mod
biker who can’t wait to crack open the

The Reid Brothers celebrate a
decade of noisy, blurry, overdriven gui-
tars with their latest effort Stoned and
Dethroned. Back in 1984, Jim and
William Reid founded the Jesus and
Mary Chain and they released a single
“Upside Down.” Their debut album
Psychocandy followed shortly after-
wards. It was an aura of guitar feed
back and glittering noise. Who knew it
would become one of the most influen=
tial albums of all time and bring about a
new genre of sullen guitar friction. The
next year, Some Candy Talking EP
was released and topped the U?‘
charts.

The success in their native land
sparked the success of more layered-
noise bands such as My BlOOC‘§'y’
Valentine and Sweverdriver. The
power of the JAMC was nihilistic;
music was being twisted by musicai
distortion and deformed by their per-
sonalities.

Almost a decade later, the Jesus and ‘V

Mary Chain are not the same iads.
When the boys signed to Def Arrerican
Records (now just American Records)
they mutated their trademark of guitar

noise and incorporated a new house— 

music drum beats.

Honey's Dead was their album. a
masterpiece of fuzzy gold sounds. Th
first single, “Fleverence,” contained
provocative and slightly controversial
lyrics (‘‘I wanna die like Jesus Christ 
I wanna die like JFK.”) The result was

worthy enough for a slot on the second
Lollapalooza Tour in 1992.

The album never achieved much
commercial success in America. Jim
said, “After two days, we wanted to
leave  We play songs and you take it
or leave it.” He continued, “We don’t
really sell ourselves on stage,” but
William added, “Don’t get us wrong. l

Everything is different now. Stoned

Stoned and Dethroned’s constant

BACK ‘I'D THE BASICS OF BOP

ﬁiﬁ ﬁﬁﬁﬁﬂﬁ ﬁﬁrﬂié ﬁt? Wéﬁ % ﬁﬁaﬁ W3”? éﬁﬁﬁ 

The other day I started
ruminating about the impor-
tance of the Pitt Jazz Seminar
and Concert, now in its 24th
year. By now jazz music has
moved up to the institutional
stage and received laudations
by stuffed shirts about its sta-
tus as a “serious” art form, the
only one this country has cre-
ated.

These accolades make
sense and are long overdue,
but they are problematic at
the same time. You see, folks
who put jazz music on this
pedestal act as if the music
stopped growing after a cer-
tain point. The same “young
lions” that pay homage to pio-
neers of jazz never acknowl-
edge the expansion of com-
posers and players like
Anthony Braxton, Charles
Gayle or Hal Russell. They
stick with one epoch, never
changing or expanding.

And to me that’s wrong,
because jazz music is about
changing shape and never
staying in one spot for too
long. More importantly, this
music is about emotion, pure
unbridled emotion.

That’s why I dig listening to

‘Cecil Tay|or’s free forays as

much as Ben Webster's bal-
lads. Both of them pack an
emotional wallop.

People still get on free jazz
players for going onstage and
making what sounds like
racket. Anyone with half a
brain realizes that what Cecil
or Archie Shepp or Ornette
Coleman plays takes a lot of
skill, energy and discipline.
You have to admire Shepp
especially. When he came up
in the ‘60s, he would play his
own compositions with that
gruff, hard-to-figure tone of
his. Then he could just as
easily go into a lyrical reading
of ‘‘In A Sentimental Mood.”

Now that’s emotion, jack.
Who else can you think of
that handles 180 degree turns
so dexteriously?

It ain’t Kenny G. That
chump personifies everything
wrong with commercial jazz.
He takes music that is sup-
posed to move listeners and
sanitizes it to the point that it
becomes muzak. And his
fans, like lemmings, think this
is what jazz is all about.

People think Mr. G
deserves a medal because he
can hold a note on his sax ad
nauseam. Let me tell you
folks, a guy named Flahsaan
Roland Kirk perfected this
skill, known as circular
breathing, years ago as a way
to ensure taking a breath
didn't get in the way of play-
ing long phrases. You can
blow 10 choruses of “Take
the A Train” or 10 minutes of
A-flat without coming up for
air. So Kenny G prefers the
latter, thereby turning circular
breathing into a cheap gim-
mick. Oh, how clever. Baby,

Singer Geri Allen, percussionist T.S. Monk Jr., and bassist Ray Drummond will appear at the Jazz Seminar.

wake me up when it's over.

Which brings me back to the
Pitt Jazz Seminar and
Concert. The annual event
chucks the newly acquired
pretension of jazz and takes it
back to the basics, where
sounds tell more than $9 col-
lege words ever will about this
music.

The university’s Dr. Nathan
Davis knows how to gather a
group of musicians who, with
little preparation, can go
onstage, communicate with
each other and produce that
emotion l was talking about.
Some of the musicians have
played together before, some
haven’t. But their heads are all
in the same place and they
know how to work together.

in other words, Davis hosts
what was once know as a
blowing session, where the
cats get together and blow
their horns, collectively and
individually.

But unlike the salad days of
blowing, when the tunes occa-
sionally digressed an endless
parade of solos over the same
chord changes, Davis

arranges a show that avoids
such cliches. On Saturday
you'll hear thoughtful arrange-
ments on some standards
along with spotlights on indi-
vidual members of the band.

This year's show provides
an interesting combination,
with a frontline of seasoned
veterans and a rhythm section
of younger, but able-bodied
players. Pianist Geri Allen,
bassist Ray Drummond and
drummer Thelonious Monk, Jr.
represent the latest develop-
ments of jazz, which have
taken place within the last
decade.

Upfront we have three saxo-
phonists: Johnny Griffin,
Grover Washington, Jr. and

_ Davis. The combination pro-

vides an interesting cross sec-
tion of styles.

When I attended the Jazz
Concert in 1991, Davis stole
the show from the other sax-
men, Ernie Watts and Hank
Crawford, pushing his post-
Coltrane ideas to a fiery
extreme. My big Q is whether
veteran bop cat Griffin will
whup the Doc’s ass, so to

speak.

After my introductory tirade,
you probably think ol’ Skitch
will be blowing spitballs at
Grover Washington, seeing as
he's partially responsible for
Kenny G (hey, he said some-
thing to that effect the last
time he was here.) But, that’s
not the kind of guy I am. And
anyway, Grover is a multi-
dimensional player who knows
this idiom and should dip into
it more often.

The trumpet section also
shows a combination of old
and new. Clark Terry wailed in
the brass section of Count
Basie’s and Duke Ellington’s
bands in the ‘40s and ‘50s.
We ought to feel honored that
he blesses us with his pres-
ence this weekend. Wallace
Roney made a name for him-
self, among other places, in
the Jazz Messengers and on
the re-recorded “Birth of the
Cool” session, where he
replaced the late Miles Davis.

In preparation for Saturday’s
concert, seven of the musi-
cians will host free lectures
about their instruments. Friday

morning Griffin, Monk,
Drummond and Allen will
speak in that order. Saturday
morning’s events feature
Roney, Terry and Washington.

For those of us who think
that women don’t get enough
representation in the music
business, Helen Keane pro-
vides some hope. Tonight this
pioneer producer and manag-
er speaks about her work in
the biz.

This weekend’s events pro-

vide a significant example of
why this music remains so
vital, and how, when done
right, it can move mountains.
Be there to dig it. Tell ‘em
Skitch sent you.
All seminars take place in the
William Pitt Union Assembly

THE THREE CUCKOLDS is a comic play
originating in the commedia deII’arte of the
Italian Renaissance. Its pantomimic roles of
masked and unmasked figures in
spontaneous situations embody the inﬂuences
of many cultures upon the characterization of
a classic troublemaker. Do not miss this
opportunity to witness riveting excerpts of the
play and discuss its enigmatic history with
Director and Cast immediately before its
preview opening.

studio‘ Theatre —— (base-
ment of the Cathedral) —— Nov.
4-19

We get to bring pillows to
the play! Right on — well,
actually to sit on. I cannot wait
to see the actors sitting on
stage for their scene to begin
or dance around or juggle, as I
sit, on my pillow, swallowing
my first taste of commedia
dell’ arte. Commedia dell’ arte
is a highly physical, improvisa-
tional style of theatre from
Italian Renaissance troupes in
the late 16th, early 17th cen-
turies.

The plots unfold around
love, money and revenge to
name a few. You know — the
usual everyday games we
play. The plays are based on
stock characters: the greedy
old man (vecchie), the clever
and stupid servants (zanni)
and the young lovers (I don’t
know the Italian for that -
Dean from the prop shop sug-
gested, “bambino amore.”)

All the characters wear
masks except the beautiful,
eloquent young lovers which
allows the audience to admire
their grace, contrasting the
other characters.

Caldwell’s ideas capture the
same theatrical style with
stereotypical characters, phys-
ical bits, period costumes, live
sound effects and a whole
slew of craziness.

Cuckold means a man
whose wife has had an affair,
so you get the gist of the play
just from the title. The plot of
the story is not as important
as the physical comedy,
improvisations and the humor
of the characters.

Leon Katz, who worked for
Pitt, adapted the play in the
1950s derived from old, com-
media scenarios. In 1970, The
Three Cucko/ds was per-
formed at Pitt and it returns for
a second time next week.

Caldwell remarked that the
entire company has con-
tributed to creating this com-
media. The actors, techni-

clans, direction and script
have added something to the
show.

‘‘I believe theatre is an expe-
rience. Both performers and
audience members are
absolutely integral for the
experience,” expressed
Caldwell. “What we're doing is
for the audience. We hope
they have a darn good time."

city theater's production of ioe orton's Loot

momma passed away and his
lover (Dennis, played by
Christian Fiummel) wants to
marry his father's fiancé/nurse
(Anne Louise Bannon). Dean
gives Hal a sense of boyish
innocence, as if the grand lar-
ceny he just committed was a
child's prank. He presents him-
self as “stupid,” yet he reveals
the meat of the play.

Bannon shines as Fay,
whose bedside manner
remains unparalleled. In her
short skirts and low-cut tops,
she’s deliciously evil to the
core. Yet because of her wit,
she never alienates herself
from the audience. The char-
acter’s whiny accent is both
the most unlikable and most
endearing aspect of her.

Truscott (Don Wadsworth),
is the batty, self—absorbed
inspector, once praised for
tracking down the “limb|ess girl
murderer’ (?), assigned to the
case. His disguise as a
Metropolitan Water Board
worker is absolutely Monty
Python-esque. He is arguably
given the best lines of the play.
He changes ties for almost
every scene, and changes his
moral tone of voice by the end
of the play.

The set consists of a well-to-
do parlor that is highly detailed
down to the ceramic dishes
hung on the wall. The coffin
and the corpse are amusing

    

 

props that add to the pace of
the play, especiallyaduring the
air guitar/percussion
sequence. The lighting is well
done, especially the fade out
on the inspector at the end of
the first act.

However, there is never a
strong comedic/emotional tug
on the audience through the
course of the play. For
instance, the audience is intro-
duced to the relationship
between Dennis and Hal, but
then their emotional connec-
tion drops off, and we never
get a sense of the level of their
relationship. We don’t get the
reasoning behind the money
lust of Fay, or of her sexual
interest in Dennis before he
becomes rich. Most pointedly,
the audience never learns why
the inspector, after such a
meticulous investigation, turns
fickle. Because of this lack of
development, it’s difficult to
care what happens to the
characters, detracting from the
play as a whole.

Loot spoofs the medical pro-
fession, Catholicism, police
brutality and almost spoofs
itself. There is no time to
breathe during the play — its
campy pace is unrelenting.
The audience is pulled from
one scenario to another, just
like the dead corpse. At least
it’s a fun ride.

Jonathan Davis rehashed all
the traumatic experiences of
his childhood and set them to
music on his latest album
Korn. This guy has been
through a lot of shit! Listening
to this album is like taking a
metallic trip through his
deranged and disfunctional
past. There’s so much emo-
tional excitement and displea-
sure that it raised my blood
pressure. it sounds as if their
musical influences are
Metallica, Rage Against the
Machine and Pantera (which
are very positive influences),
but they still maintain their own
original sound. Korn is metal
with a creative, melodic twist.

The “Jekyll and Hyde” vocals
of Jonathan Davis psychologi-
cally manipulated me into lik-
ing this album. lt’s so damn
unpredictable! One minute he
sounds like a feeble, harmonic
cherub; the next minute he
sounds like Satan’s stepson.
Korn uses bagpipes, drums,
bass and soul-jerking guitars
that accommodate Davis’ pres-
sure cooker voice so well. In
“Ball Tongue” Davis goes from
harsh, throat splitting shouts to
a weak, wailing murmur.

This song is a “faget’s”
response to all of the school-
yard bullies who violently
questioned his manhood. “You
can suck my dick and fuckin’
like it!!!”, he screams, but he
does it in such a passionately
vindictive way that you forget
about its offensiveness.

I really like Korn’s style.
They are twisted and atypical,
and I love it. These guys are
not a bunch of phony metal
fanatics. They are serious as
hell! in “Divine" you can hear
Davis breathing heavily in
between verses. It's so real.
“Shoots and Ladders” is an
explosive collage of corrupted
nursery rhymes set to a ran-
dom bagpipe melody. ln
“Fake,” the lyrics are echoed in
a mystical round with soothing,
celestial strings droning in the
background, then all of a sud-
den, out of nowhere, these
fire-breathing vocals shoot
through your speakers
screaming “Fake” to the tune
of a whirlwind, scanning guitar.
The last song on the album,
“Daddy,” is the most remark-
ably outlandish song I have
ever heard. lt’s too intense to
go into detail, you just had to
be there.

Korn is pleasantly crude and
genuine. it is an ironic mixture

The Black Crowes
American Recordings

it seems like the Black
Crowes have finally reached
the point in their musical
career where they can preach
a little bit. An album cover
depicting a woman in a stars
and bars G-string overflowing
with pubic hair, while the title
amorica. looms under her
bellybutton, could be consid-
ered preachy. Well maybe the
Crowes deserve to be. They
grew out of playing anemic
blues standards, like their hit
cover of “Hard to Handle,” and
have started playing some
serious rock ‘n’ roll/blues tunes
on amorica.

Listening to this album
makes me wish I had never cut
off my hair. I could not help but
pull my hollow-body guitar off
the wall and join the jam ses-
sion. Amorica is the kind of
album that starts strong,
meanders in the middle and
explodes at the end. It made
me push the replay button on
my CD player to start the

experience all over again.

The opening song, “Gone,”
starts with some dirty chords
falling out of Rich Robinson’s
guitar. i would guess he is
strumming a vintage, cherry
red Gibson ES-335. The crack-
le of the strings is great.
Drums kick in over a smooth
bass line, and then Chris
Robinson starts up his raspy
voice like a chainsaw, pull by
pull. The combination makes
for a song that would not be
out of place on The Rolling
Stones’ Exile on Main Street.

Critics have charged over
and over again that the
Crowes are a Stones rip-off.
Robinson and Marc Ford’s gui-
tars are often tuned to open G,
while drowning in a pool of
reverb. Both of them sound
like graduates of the Keith
Richards school of rock ‘n’ roll.
But so what. Their sound, the
Stones and the Crowes, is
refreshing in a world over-
loaded with hip-hop and
heavy-metal.

Amorica starts to thin out
with songs like, “P. 25
London.” This tune feels like a
contrived blues song ladened
with sloppy, steel-slide guitar
playing. Anymore songs like
this, and the album is endan-
gered of sitting on my shelffor

years on end. The Crowes can
do a lot better than this. “She
Gave Good Sunflower’ hits the
middle of the road. The rhythm
sounds like their past top-10
hit, “She Talks to Angels” as its
chorus climaxes then abruptly
stops only to rejuvenate once
again. Add some gritty guitar
parts to spice things up, and
you have yourself an enjoyable
number.

The first 10 songs culminate
into the last song,
“Descending.” This number
sends the Crowes into some
new found territory. it is an
awe inspiring mix of wire-thin
guitar and piano played over
Robinson’s ever-changing
vocal stature. He can go from
a whisper to a how! in a split
second. “Descending” does
not rely on the chunky electric
rhythms to thrust its weight
around. The Black Crowes
may have stumbled upon a
sound all their own.

The latest rendition of the
Black Crowes is definitely their
strongest. They still capitalize
on the Stones old sound, but
have found a way to make it
sound fresh. If bell-bottoms,
long hair and rock ‘n’ roll kindle
your spirit, then amorica. is
bound to please you.

Woodson
is turning
to toast

C ‘We want
to go
after him

early.”

The man
who uttered
this remark
was Arizona
Cardinal QB
Steve
Beuerlein.
Now “going
after” someone, usually a
defensive back, is not surpris-
ing. Many teams will do this
to a rookie or a second string
player. What’s surprising is
that Beuerlein was making ref-
erence to Steeler All-Time
comerback Rod Woodson.

It’s not surprising to me.
And it’s not surprising that
Beuerlein did exactly what he
said and made Woodson look
like a rookie on national tele-
vision. The fact is it has been
happening all season.

It started against Dallas
when Michael Irvin made a ,
long circus catch at Woodson’s
expense. It worsened when he
was exploited by lowly
Cincinnati. It got even uglier
against New York when ex-

    

Columist

, Steeler Chris Calloway beat

Woodson four times on deep
routes. It’s one thing to get
used by Troy Aikman, it’s
another to get beat by David
Klingler and Dave Brown. In
fact, it’s downright embarrass-
ing.

The whole mess culminated
Sunday night when Ricky
Proehl, who has never been
confused with Andre Rison,
beat Woodson for 63 yards
which was Arizona’s longest
offensive play of the year.

That was the big play, but as
I watched the game, I picked
up a number of plays that
Woodson usually makes but
didn’t.

Early in the first half, he had
a sure interception skip right
through his hands. Then the
Proehl debacle, which was fol-
lowed by a particularly ugly
series in the third quarter. On
first down, he was again beat-
en by Proehl. On second down
he was called for illegal con-
tact and on the ensuing play he
dropped another interception.
On the next play he blitzed
and got to Beuerlein, but
instead of trying to take his
head off, he jumped to try to
knock down the pass.
Beuerlein let Woodson jump
right by him and threw to
Randall Hill for a big gain.

But during the whole game,
the announcers were constant-
ly chattering about how great
Woodson is. They foolishly
praised him while his team-
mate on the other side. Deion

Pitt's West leads conference in rushing

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sports Editor

This was supposed to be the
year sophomore Billy West
watched Curtis Martin move
into second place on Pitt’s all-
time rushing list.

But after Martin injured his
ankle in the second game of
the season, he hasn’t played
since — leaving the door open
for West. West has made the
most of his opportunity.

Currently, he is running

away with
the Big East
rushing title,
as his 1,010
r u s h i n g
yards lead
the confer-
ence, ranking him amongst the
nation’s best. .

His closest competitor in the
conference is Boston
College’s David Green with
702 yards.

“Getting the rushing title
would be great,” West said.
“Getting a thousand yards was
a dream. It’s like a mark for
running backs to attain, that
was a dream. If the rushing
title comes, it would be help-
ful because that was some-
thing I never thought about so
if I got it, it would be a dream
come true. It’ll be worth-
while.”

West's success has taken
him by surprise.

“I was kind of thrown into
it,” he said. “Who would have

Panthers‘ schedule.

known I’d be playing this
early.

“Sometimes being a young
person trying to help the team,
you try to do a lot. Sometimes
what I do can lead to mistakes.
There are things I have to get
used to every play.”

While West feels his mis-
takes are costly, the fact is he
has been one of the Panthers’
bright spots in a dismal sea-
son.

The 5-foot-8-inch, 195

pounder ran for 226 yards,
averaging an impressive 8.6
yards per carry in Pitt’s 30-16
victory over Ohio University,
the second game of the season.

Then two weeks later, play-
ing with a bruised shoulder,
West rushed 28 times for 170
yards against Boston College
(the second- best rushing
defense in the conference.)

His superb performances
didn’t stop there.

The Ohio native galloped for

158 yards and one touchdown
against Louisville, which was
highlighted by a 51-yard rush,
which was Pitt’s longest run
from scrimmage this season.

Last week against the
Temple Owls he scampered
for 149 yards.

Normally when an athlete of
his caliber steps in and per-
forms as he has done, he is a
lock-in for starting the upcom-
ing season. But with Martin’s

Swim teams start season on opposite ends

By Brady Slater
Senior Staff Writer

It is going to be a tale of two
teams this season for the Pitt’s
male and female swimmers
and divers. The men are
primed for the best of times,
while it will be the thirst of

times for a rebuilding
women’s team striving to
improve.

For the men, the sweet taste
of last season's Big East cham-
pionshipstill lingers, but a
season-ending No. 24 ranking
in the College Swim Coaches’
Association poll has left the
men hungry for something
more.

“Yes, it is a very sweet kind
of victory,” head coach Chuck
Knoles said of the Big East
championship. “But our sights
are now very firmly set on
going beyond that.”

There used to be nothing
beyond the conference cham-
pionship for Big East teams,
but not any more.

“Pitt has opened the door for
everyone in the Big East,”
Knoles said. “I’m sure they
don’t view it that way, but I
very definitely do.”

Why else would Miami and
Syracuse go out and get two

Senior captain Matt Brady and the men's swimming and div-
ing team look to win the Big East for the 12th time in 13 years.

nationally acclaimed recruiting
classes? “

“We're going to see the Big
East as a whole step up this
year,” Knoles said.

And in order to keep up with
the monster it has created, Pitt
went out and got some pretty
good recruits itself.

“This [recruiting class] is
really the first step to ‘becom-
ing top 10 in the nation,”
freshman Steve Lewter said.

Pitt’s prized recruits include
Georgia’s 100-yard butterﬂy
champ Lewter, Florida’s 100-

yard fly champ Steven
McQueen and Pennsylvania's
Eric Stefanski, who was one of
the hottest recruited athletes in
the East and whom Knoles
calls a “blue-chip swimmer.”
Mix them and the other
freshmen together with the
returning men’s squad and
you’ll hear this: “Our talent
pool is incredible,” senior
Sami Vartianinen said.
Fronting the returners is
senior Matt Brady, whom
Knoles calls one of the most
talented he’s ever coached,

including Olympic medalists
and NCAA champions.

“Matt Brady has entered his
senior year in probably the
best shape that he’s been in
since he was l4,” Knoles said.

Brady and sophomore diver
John Soulakis were the only
two members of the Pitt team
to compete in the NCAA

"championships last season.

This year they want more.

“The NCAA is by far the
fastest meet in the world,
faster than the Olympics. It’s
the swim meet of the year for
men,” Knoles said. “We’d
want to get as many guys as
possible to the Big Dance.
We’d like to send a couple of
relays and a couple of divers.”

They also want to climb in
the rankings.

“We’re going for top 15,”
Vartianinen said.

But if the Panthers want to
achieve that, they must win
their dual meets, something
Knoles is a bit worried about.

“We have by far the deepest
team in the Big East,” Knoles
said. “But we don’t necessarily
have the superstars that the
other teams have. We've got
some, but not quite as many as
Miami or even Syracuse at this

‘Swimming, page 8

‘From page 7
point.

“There’s a big danger this
year for us to start off with a
soft record in the fall semester
based on dual meets, just

\because dual meets have a ten-

dency to favor teams with
superstars.”

Among the teams Pitt faces
in its first half are perennial
powers Ohio State, Princeton
and Virginia. And this
Saturday the Panthers head
into a Big East showdown
with a tri—meet against
Syracuse and Miami in New
York.

“If wewant to get into the
[top 20], it’s going to happen
this semester,” Knoles said of
the tough schedule.

‘.‘We’re going to have to
depend on Brady to win all of
his events. We’re going to
have to depend on Chris Perry

strokes. We’re going to have to

Bacharach to stand up and race
really hard this year in order to
win those dual meets.”

And depending on what you
believe, the pool is either half
full or half empty for the
women’s team.

Seventeen of the 29 mem-
bers of this season’s team are
freshmen.

And that’s just fine with
optimistic second-year coach
Marian Cassidy.

“It’s going to be an interest-
ing year, because when you
have so many young swim-
mers it’s definitely a learning
year,” Cassidy said. “But I
think we’ve got a good core
group of upperclassmen that
will lead the girls in the right
direction.”

The women’s team is lead
by senior swimmers Christy
Knobloch, Vicki Geubtner and
Jill Fletcher, along with a tal-
ented diving corps headed by
senior Kara. Sixbury and
juniors Sunday Lewandowski
and Amy Spinnenwebber.

“Knobloch has been and will
continue to be a force in the
fly and backstroke, and I’m
definitely looking for Vicki
Geubtner to step up in the

 

sprint frees,” Cassidy said.

Fletcher, an individual med-
ley swimmer and breaststro-
ker, and Knobloch are both
recovering from back injuries.
Cassidy said they're playing it
smart right now.

“We’re not going to break
them apart,” Cassidy said.
“We’re looking  down the
road.”

Both the women will contin-
ue swimming, but Cassidy
doesn’t expect them to be
swimming at 100 percent per-
formance until February.

She does expect the fresh-
men to step in and contribute
right away, but she’s not
putting too much pressure on
them.

“We’re not talking about
them coming in and making
NCAAs off the bat,” Cassidy
said. “We’re talking about a
group of girls that’s very much
on the verge of breaking
through. They’re going to be
developing over the next four
years, and it’s going to be
exciting.” S

Considering the rebuilding
stage of her program, Cassidy
isn’t setting many concrete

goals.

“We’re looking to be an
overall better team than last
year,” Cassidy said. “We’re
not going to focus too much
on our record. We’re focusing
on becoming better at every
meet and learning from one
meet to the next.”

If their first meet, a 98-94
dual relay meet loss to Ohio
University, is any indication,
the improvements have
already begun.

“Considering that last year
we lost by over 30 ——- almost
40 — points, I’m very pleased
with the turnaround,” Cassidy
said.

Just having 24 swimmers is
going to be a luxury for
Cassidy, whose team was
strapped by a lack of numbers
and injuries last season.

“It’s exciting to have 24
people in the pool. There’s
always something going on,"
Cassidy said. “By the end of
last year, we wouldn’t have
more than 12 or 13 people at
practice, and that’s hard for
them to get up and get excited
about.”

But the advantage of larger
numbers doesn’t stop there.
Swimmers won’t have to
focus on three or four events
as they did last year. There are
enough people to fill out the
events- while allowing swim-
mers to focus on their two
best events.

“It gives everyone on the
team. a little bit more of an
opportunity to be successful at
what they do best,” Cassidy
said.

Another opportunity Pitt is
taking advantage of to insure
its best performance is the
dropping Cleveland State and
Kenyon from the schedule

and the addition top-25 teams V

Princeton and Ohio State.

“We’re looking towards
challenging at higher levels,”
Cassidy said. “And the only
way to get to that level is for
us to race that level.”

The part of the team that is _‘i 

already at a higher level is the

better game. The real truth is
that right now Woodson is liv-
ing off his reputation.

It’s hard to say whether his
confidence is shot or he has
lost a step. Whatever it is, it’s
clear that he is having real
problems in deep man cover-
age.

Teams are keying on him
and it’s hurting the Steelers.
When Steve Beuerlein is talk-
ing trash on you, it’s time to
step it up a bit, which is what
Woodson must do to avoid
having the worst season of his
otherwise stellar career.

indecision on leaving after
this season, West is unsure of
what the future entails.

“I’d like to have Curt back
for the team,” West said.

“But will I still get the same
amount of time as this year. It
will be hard from getting a lot
of playing time to a little bit.

“But I will love to have him
back.”

Other Panthers who pro-
pelled their performances to
another level this season are
Jason Chavis, David Sumner,
Billy Davis and John Ryan.

After having a subpar sea-
son a year ago, Chavis is cur-
rently leading the Panthers
with 80 total tackles (32 solo

stops) and two interceptions.

With the recent absence of
Tom Tumulty, the junior line-
backer has assumed the lead-
ership role on defense.

°Sumner, who last season
quit the team before the last
game of the season, is playing
as if he never left.

The 6-foot-2-inch, 200-
pound safety is third on the
team with 61 stops. He is tied
for third on the team with one
interception.

-Davis, a fifth—year senior
from Texas, has assumed the
leadership on offensive. His
30 pass receptions for this sea-
son lead the Panthers. He is
currently ranked second in
receiving yards with 432.

-Last year, Ryan took the
blame for the Panthers for
their 3-8 record. But after
starting in the last three
games, the quarterback is
erasing all of the doubt.

His pass rating of 162.78
ranks him second behind
Syracuse’s Kevin Mason
(166.16) in the conference.

In the game against West
Virginia on Oct. 15, he threw
for 433 yards and four touch-
downs.

After having an open date
this Saturday before the
Panthers play Miami Nov. 12,
West, Ryan and Davis look to
boost their stats against the
Hurricanes’ No. 3 defense in
the country.
