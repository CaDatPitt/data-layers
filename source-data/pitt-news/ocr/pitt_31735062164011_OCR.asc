Two Plays
Acclaimed
Effective.

By WAYNE CLAEREN

As I was leaving the Pitt
Players’ production of Iones-
co’s two plays “Jack” and
“The Chairs”, I overheard the
comments of two students be-
hind me. The first asked,
“What were they supposed to
be about? I didn’t get it at
all.” His partner answered.
that he understood complete-
ly and proceeded to explain

« the two plays in detail.

I believe the comments of these
two men are characteristic of the
two main reactions to plays of
this type. Some are not moved
or excited at all. Others believe
they understand perfectly and
feel they are “in” on every
strange line and movement.

If you react in either of these
extremes or somewhere in the
middle I am sure you are cor-
rect. Because of the peculiar na-
ture of the plays, no one ‘can
challenge another individual view
with much authority.

Meaningful Characters

Ionesco believes that charac-
ters should be represented not
only as they speak and act in life
but also as they think, dream and
imagine. The characters in a par-
are
con-
may
only

clearly indicated but their
fusing dialogue and action
be meaningful to the play or
to themselves.

The audience, therefore, may
be searching for meaning or
may feel left out. Because hu-
man thought is often blurred
and distorted, the action of the

Equipment
Put In Towers

A photography darkroom in the
Towers Dormitory will open June
15.

Before now the room was avail-
able but lacked equipment. When
the funds were collected by mem-
bers of the Photo Club by selling
photographs of major spring
sports, an enlarger and other sup-
plies were purchased. A

Responsible for the opening
of the darkroom are Stanley
Shalita, Photo Club treasurer;
Margie Nichols, former Pitt
News photo editor; Beano Cook,
director of athletic publicity;
James Salem, Auxiliary Enter-
prises; Curt Roemele, director
of men’s housing.

High school juniors at the
University for the annual Photo-
graphy Clinic from June 28-July
3 will test the darkroom.

The twenty ﬁve active members
of the Photo Club who paid their
four dollar dues will receive
chemicals and facilities for the
darkroom. Membership may be

Liddle plays Mother in the University Theatre’s production of
“Jack or the Submission.” “Jack,” along with a second play, “The
Chairs,” played to near capacity audiences in its first week-end of
performances. The two plays will run again Friday and Saturday

play is also intentionally ‘blurred
and distorted.

One thing that can be felt in
“Jack” is discomfort. What Jack
must submit to is unpleasant
though . unescapable.

Maintains Depressing Mood

I believe the maintenance of
this depressing mood is the out-
standing feature of the Pitt pro-
duction. The set and the staging
effectively combine to reveal the
uncomfortable situation and the

.detachment of one character from

another. '

There is no real opportunity

Alumni Attend J

une F estivitiesi

Last week’s June Week, attend-
ed by a record number of alumni,
was their chance to return to
their alma mater.

The Annual Alumni-Faculty
Golf Day, at Wildwood Country
Club last Wednesday was followed

by a dinner and movies .of the 1963
and 1964 Masters Tournaments.

Friday night’s Patio Punch
Party, a pre-dinner reception with
strolling musicians and a French
cafe in the Quad, ended with a
smorgasbord dinner in the SU.

A dance held in the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association Ballroom in-
cluded the music of Bill LeRoy
and movie highlights of the 1963
football season. ,

Education Seminars stimu-
lated the alumni wits and pencils
on Saturday. For the third
year, the alumni and professors
tackled subjects of current in-
terest. The topics ranged from
the recognition of Red China to
an analysis of the 1964 presi-
dential election.

Dr. Edgar B. Cale, Assistant
Chancellor for Development, end-
ed the Saturday classes with a
speech entitled “The State of the
University Message to Alumni."

Dr. Cale stressed the “improve-
ment in the size and quality of
the students and faculty" at the
University.  I

ﬁne his relationship, and then
retire. Each role can be han-
dled in many ways and the
cast all have interesting in-
terpretations.

The outstanding bit is the se-
duction scene which is nicely
built by Ream Lazaro and Bon-
nie Ratner. The physical effect
which Ionesco tries to represent
through words, motion and light-
ing comes across quite well.

Acting In Chairs Outstanding

While “Jack” is more interest-
ing for mood, “The Chairs” is
more successful for an outstand-

State’s Financial Aid .    

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 10, 1964:

The University could lose considerable ﬁnancial aid in
the upcoming controversy before the State Board of Educa-

tion over State aid to private‘

colleges and universities.

Defenders "of State aid to private schools argue that
establishing new State universities would cost far more, and
take-years longer to carry out, than aiding existing schools.

Critics of the existing aid

program state that it is foolish,

to pump aid into private high—tuition.colleges' with entrance
standards that only a small percentage of- Pennsylvania high

school graduates can meet.

ternational Night Club Mixer, and
a course in modern ballroom danc-

June 20 is the date for the pic-
nic in Deer Valley, 90‘miles south
of Pittsburgh. The entertainment
for this country area will consist
of horseback riding, swimming,
canoeing, water skiing and sail-

largest amounts of state aid.,The
University receives $3,517,000 a
year for general purposes and ad-
ditional grants for its medical and
library programs.

While Temple has agreed to,

period of years, Chancellor Ed-
ward H. Litchﬁeld has saidthat
the University can not afford‘ to
become a state school because it
would lose its private sources of
revenue.

There are signs, however, that
state aid to private schools are
coming to _an end. Last summer,
Governor William Scranton an-
nounced that the General State
Authority (GSA)..-would no longer
ﬁnance new buildings for private
colleges unless the colleges repaid
the money.

GSA Discontinues Aid

Since 1956 when~ GSA began
ﬁnancing private college build-
ings, the University has received
ﬁfty million dollars in building
aid. Another $10,400,000 in State
aid is necessary for construction
of library, education, and social
work schools and for dormitories
at the regional campuses.

The quibble going on right now in the State Board of Education

.Marvin Zelkowitz’s story on Dr. Robert Levine (“Dr. Levine

I don’t wish to detract from Dr. Levine’s accomplishments,
but, if one may assume that there is no inherent state of being
“special” that pertains to organic chemistry, I think it perhaps
appropriate tomention that I recall that seven years ago our
professor in quantitative analysis at Columbia was using what I

‘prize and honorable mention in a

As a sophomore he won ﬁrst,

As a junior he did not do as
well. He won only one ﬁrst, two

. ‘A Moveahle Feast’

By MATT NESVISKY'

Ernest Hemingway’s ﬁrst

. posthumous book, A Mope-

able Feast (Charles SC7"I.b-

ner’sSon, 211 pp., $4.95), is

a collection of images of

the novelists’s early days
in Paris in the 1920’s.

The City is here, and the
writers and painters and hang-
ers-on -— the entire atmosphere
of the Lost Generation and the
quiver of the 20’s —- but most-
ly, this book is about Heming-
way himself. .

‘Hemingway wrote this book
» in the last years of his life and
it is the smooth, sure Papa

self in his pre-moustache‘ days

-as a. fast-driving, dynamic,

competitive free spirit; in short

 interesting than enjoyable. This
becomes their chief downfall. Be-
cause of over-emphasis on ideas

which we read here. With ease‘
and ingenuity, he presents him-

I believe Harvey Miller's end- ,

fortlessly ticks off his loves and
hates.

He begins with Gertrude
Stein and —her ever-present
shadow. Alice B. Toklas. He
tells" how he ﬁrst came to
the famous salon with hum-
ble admiration and how that
eventlly changed toa kind of
tolerant contempt as he
learned that the intellect and
the heart could not be regu-
lated like a thermostat.

Next, he expresses a quiet
love for Sylvia Beach, Ezra
Pound, James Joyce and a
handful of others who had al-
lowed- Paris to work her magic
onthem. But he comes roaring
back with a shattering protrait
of Ford Madox Ford, bursting
that unfortunate’s literary and
personal ballons, forever.

And when he writes of Scott
Fitzgerald,- his t e m p e r m e n t
snakes back and forth between
love_and hate. Devoting almost

one quarter of the book to the V,

fair-haired literary Alexander
of the early 20’s, Hemingway
again brings to life the tragedy .
of Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald was

Hemingway’s kind of writer,
but certainly not his kind of
man. In a series of brilliantly-“
toned‘ scenes, he describes his
ﬁrst-meeting with the already-
established Fitzgerald, an in-
sane over-night jaunt to Lyon,
and a ﬁnal discussion with
Scott concerning his wife, Zelda.

Hemingway’ recalls his own
startled revulsion as Fitzgerald
groveled at the feet of alco-
holism, at the persecution of
his wife and at his own self-
torturings. Under the glib, glit-
tering gaiety of Fitzgerald,
Hemingway detected the classic
tragedy and encroaching doom
of the man-, and brings it alive
again for the reader.

Through all of this is Hem-
ingway: Papa the master crafts-.
