. Campus center of cultural exchange between superpowers

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

As the days count down to the

opening of “Chautauqua at Pitt: The
 General Chautauqua Conference
Q  . Soviet relations,” students, faculty

midgtaffalike are putting the ﬁnishing touches
)I'l preparations that started more than eight
months ago.

“There are so many things to do and we barely
had nine months to do it. That's why we’ve been
working until midnight every day this week in
preparation,” said Diane Saylor, who helped to coordinate
the event along with the university’s center for international
studies. — V

‘~3vSaylor said that translating different documents for the more
than 250 Soviet citizens and officials who will be participating in

“Since some of the Soviets don’t speak English, everything from menu
cards to maps had to be translated. It was a lot of work from the beginning
when we had all of these ideas to sort through and deal with but now
everything is coming together,” said Saylor. A

Saylor said that hundreds of students were involved in the preparation and will

. gelping to make things work behind thenscenes during the program.

 1 of these student volunteers will be ushering, working at information desks,
working as runners and distributing materials,” Saylor said.

Chautauqua will explore the future of U.S.—Soviet relations from Oct. 29 to Nov. 3 in
free, open-to—the—public sessions. ‘

{TI think that is one of the things that everyone is forgetting. All of the daytime events
are free and so there is no reason why all students shouldn't try to attend,” said Saylor.

Topics will include trade and economic relations, arms control, regional conﬂicts,
human rights, space exploration and drug and alcohol abuse.

“All of the sessions involve some type of audience participation so that if students
are interested in topics like the environment and international issues, they should come
to the events ready to ask questions,” Saylor said.

Among the highlights of the conference is an audience participation event, “Citizen

Open Dialogue,” co-hosted by talk-show host Phil Donahue and Soviet journalist
Vladimir Posner. Here Americans and Soviets will exchange views on various issues and
concerns.
.Geraldine Ferraro and Marlo Thomas will speak on women’s issues. Senators Bill
Bradley andjohn Heinz will also host events. All American speakers will be joined by
“ viet counterparts.

We have also arranged for small group meeting sessions where the Soviet citizens

5.3 be able to meet similar Americans. Business people with business people, and

 a with other teachers, for example,” Saylor said.
;...;... musicians and dancers will also be brought together with Soviet performers in

 
 
 
   
   
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 

titﬁeted public performances.

 
 

“We are proud that we
were able to offer local
talent to entertain. There will A

be things that range from choir
singing to a traditional folk dance,”
Saylor said.

Pittsburgh is the first major
Americancity to host the conference,
which in its first four years was alternately
held in the Soviet Union and at the Chautauqua
Institute in western New York.

“This will be so much different from the
other conferences because of the opportunities to
I be found here in Pittsburgh. Here, if a Soviet is
interested in some aspect of business or medical
research for example, there’s a much greater chance to
learn about these things,” Saylor said. i
._ Trips to schools, churches, supermarkets and soup
kitchens are planned for the visitors, as well as activities like trick-
or—treating and pumpkin—carving. Many of the Soviets will experience
American family life first—hand while staying with local families.
“We have been working on this thing from the beginning. A lot of
hard work has gone into this program,” said Marion Hook, executive
director of the Pittsburgh Council for International Visitors.
PCIV is a non-profit organization with offices on the Pitt campus. Hook said
that Chautauqua is one of the largest projects ever to face the organization.

More than 250 families volunteered to host the Soviet citizens and 79 were chosen
to house the 151 visitors who are arriving on Friday.

“We matched families with Soviets according to common interest, occupations and
language skills,” said Hook. .

Hook said that about two-thirds of the visitors can speak English and some of the
hosts can also speak Russian. Some visitors were matched with hosts who shared
a second language.

‘The Soviets will be staying with hosts in pairs. That way, they will probably feel
more comfortable about their visit,” Hook said.

An orientation session last week included a brief cultural training and provided
host families with information about the location of the other hosts in order to help
coordinate transportation and activities.

‘Basically what we told them was to throw out any and all stereotypes about
Soviets that they had ever heard. ‘

“Absolutely no one had any concerns about security at the orientation session.
There are no restrictions on anything that the host families can say or do with their
guests,” said Hook.

Hook added that she is confident the hard work of PCIV will pay off.

“The response from the community has been tremendous. These people are very
excited about the event and] think that it is going to be a wonderful success,” Hook
said.

Chautauqua

Continued from page 3
Hyle hotel. The shy inventor
would avoid the attention of
ardent admirers by escaping
through the dining room’s
enormous windows.

Gradually, Vincent added an
expansive study of music to the
institution’s curriculum. Popular
singers, violinists, and in 1912,
‘Be New York Symphony, played
full-season engagements.

To understand this amazing
appeal, one must consider the
social, economic and political
concerns of the period, as well as
the country's diverse population.
Before the turn of the century,
the cultural opportunities offered
Qy Chautauqua were available

only in the cities. A large part of
the population residedin small
towns and villages, and few were
able to afford the luxuries of
travel, a university education, or
exposure to the great speakers,
inventors and statesmen of the
day. Chautauqua offered them a
taste of fine music, erudite
lecturers and study courses that
had previously been out of their
reach. A

In 1878, the movement spread
from the summer months into the
winter through the “Chautauqua
Literary and Scientiﬁc Circles.”
These were home- study courses
that could be completed in four
years, with the option of attending

a summer season at Chautauqua -

Institution.

These correspondence courses
became incredibly popular with
those unable to attend college
—- young female students,
married women with families
and businessmen. These study
circles laid the groundwork for
future reading societies, book
clubs, correspondence schools
and extension courses.

In 1881, Vincent and Miller
obtained a charter ’ for the
Chautauqua School of Theology,
and in 1883, the Chautauqua
University was given authority
to issue diplomas and confer
degrees. Students were able to
obtain college credit either at the
Chautauqua Institution or

Chautauqua’s influence soon
spread to the outside world
through the Chautauqua Press,
which was established by 1900,
and The Cbautauquan, a
monthly magazine. Authors
Victoria and Robert Ormond
Case, in their work We Called It
Culture, described this period of
Chautauqua’s history:
“Chautauqua meant study, music,
dramatic interpretation, lectures
and oratory, stereoptican views
and camping byithe lake shore,

  Cuts

‘Chautauquas _

the best in the cultural and
educational world, with good
food and fireworks for a grand
total of $6 to $10 alweek.”

The idea caught on rapidly;
similar assemblies were opened
in Ohio, Iowa and Michigan. By
1900, 51 states had Chautauquas
of their own. These “sister”
patterned
themselves after the “Mother
Chautauqua” in western New
York. Tents could be bought or
rented by the patrons, meals were
available, and rooms were offered

In 1903, the tent Chautauquas
began to spring up. These were
temporary, portable circuits that
were stationed in thousands of
rural towns across America,
drawing larger audiences ’by
offering culture right in one’s

hometown. The tent
Chautauquas brought the spirit
and benefit of the movement
into the minds and memories of
millions.

Gay MacLaren, in her memoir
of Chautauqua, Morally We Roll
Along, remembered her first visit A
to Chautauqua with fondness
and delightzl “At last we were at
the big New York Chautauqua.
[Motherl had expected, of course,
to see a far more pretentious
place than our little assembly on
Lake Madison, but even her vivid
imaginationhad never pictured
anything like this beautiful,
summer colony on the wooded
shores of a 22—mile-long lake.

“Instead of tents, there were

Halloween double bill at the Fulton Theatre

By Dmitri Ragano
Asst. Showcase Editor

This weekend, the Fulton
Theater is starting a cult film
double bill. The 1962 Carnival of
Souls and last year’s Tales from
Gimli Hospital are midnight
movies in the tradition of George
Romero’s Nigbiofibeiiving Dead
and David Lynch’s Eraserbeaal.
Not for the narrow—minded, these
two oddities are the perfect way
to get into the Halloween spirit.

Herk Harvey’s Camz'valofSoul9
begins with two cars full of
teenagers racing across town.
One car goes off the side of a

bridge, splashing into the river,
and the only survivor is Mary
(Candace Hilligoss), a church
organist.

Apparently not injured, Mary
travels to a small town where she
is scheduled to begin work and
starts “seeing things” —— namely a
Grandpa Munster look-alike
giving her his best zombified stare.
Mary arrives inthe town and
starts work, only to find herself
teetering between life and the
afterlife.

When Carnival of Souls first
opened, it bombed at drive-ins
across America. Now it’s getting a

second life: a new print and red-

carpet treatment at cinemas across
the country. Horror movies
become dated quicker than any
other genre (Psycho, called the
most frightening ﬁlm ever made
when released in 1960, has almost
no scare value in the '80s) and
Carnival of Souls has more camp
humor than it does thrills. The
film is fun to watch. It has the
same charm as old TwiligbtZone
episodes and Night of the Living
Dead (without the gore).

If Carnival of Souls makes one
nostalgic for bad horror from the
’60s, the Canadian Tales from
Gimli Hospitals charm is a bit
harder to place. The movie begins

 Bertolt Brecht's The Caucasian Chalk Circle

 

By Scot Ross

("Managing Editor

1' \‘Bertolt

_y“~J

As Chautauqua—at—Pitt is
bringing over 200 Russians to
meet and exchange Eastern and
Western ideas, Pitt Theatre is
bringing the tale of approximately
50 Russians to the audiences of

The Caucasian Chalk Circle.

And if the execution of the
Brecht play is any
indication of how well Soviet
philosophies can intermingle with
the American people, then cancel
the arms talks because there’s no
chance of nuclear war.

The plot centers around Grusha
(Jane Gentry), a servant to the
overthrown governor (Ioseph
Beidle). When a revolution erupts,
the governor’s wife (Camille
Hallstrom) abandons her infant
son, leaving him to the mercy of
marauding soldiers. Rather than
see the child killed, Grusha
escapes with the baby. She
promises to marry Simon Shas ava

 

(Stan Denman), a soldier leaving
to battle against the
revolutionaries.

Grusha escapes to the home of
her brother and his wife, but
when her brother is unwilling to
house her any longer, he hatches
a plan forher to marry a peasant
woman’s dying son. Naturally,
he recovers after the wedding
vows and Grusha is forced to stay
with him.

Eventually, she and Shasava
are reunited, but it is discovered
that Grusha is harboring the son
of the governor’s wife. She and
Grusha are brought before Azdak,
a debauched judge, to determine
who should keep the child.

Director Gillette Elvgren has
gathered a cast of 10 actors to
portray approximately 50 roles.
This allows him to show parallels
between characters of different
time periods by using the same
cast member to play similar roles.

For example, Michael Dowd

Fat Man and Little Boy is the
story of the development of the
first two atomic bombs ever
created, and, to a smaller degree,
those who created them. Paul
Newman stars as General Leslie
R. Groves and Dwight Schultz
(best known as the “A—Team”’s
H.M. Murdock) as J. Robert
Oppenheimer.

Under the direction of award-
winning director Rolandjoffe (The
Killing Fields, The Mission), the
film’s priorities seem to be an
exploration of the moral issues
involved in making the bombs,

manages to succeed in these three
areas, perhaps in a sketchy way,
due to the constant juggling

In the end, it can be appreciated

Warhol Museum sclaeduledfor opening in 1992

By Heather Neisworth
For The Pitt News

He had the power to transform
commonplace items such as
Campbell's Soup cans and dollar
bills into contemporary art forms.
His name was Andy Warhol and
his position as a formidable force
in 20th century art is now being
confirmed with the development
of the Andy Warhol Museum.

Formed in conjunction with
The Carnegie Museum, The Dia
Art Foundation and the Andy
Warhol Museum, it will be housed

’ on Pittsburgh’s North Side and is

scheduled to be open to the
public in the fall of 1992. Over
700 of Warhol’s paintings, prints,
films, sketches, videotapes and
sculptural works will be
displayed.

The museum will serve as a
means to explain and show
Warhol’s important contributions
to the 20th-century art world.
Mark Francis, the newly
appointed director'of the Warhol
museum, came to Pittsburgh from

the Pompidou Center ,-in Paris A

and reinforced this belief, saying
“It is inconceivable now to
consider the art of the last 30

years without accounting for the ‘

extraordinary presence of Andy

Warhol in art and the popular
culture of fashion, music and
film.”

Contrary to Warhol’s most
popular quote, “In the future
everybody will be famous for 15
minutes,” Warhol’s own fame has

remarkably endured although this ”

wasn’t always the case.

Born in 1928 to immigrant
parents, Andy grew up near the
mills in Pittsburgh in dismal
poverty. Yet at the young age of
15 he left public school to attend
Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie
Mellon University) on a
scholarship. Pursuing commercial
art studies, he displayed a need
to define himself as an artist by
portraying beauty and wealth in
his unique way.

Then, in 1949, he moved to
New York with a group of friends
to pursue his dream. It wasn’t
until 1961 that he made his first
important appearance as an artist,
by supplying five paintings as a
backdrop to a fashion scene in a
display window at Bonwit Teller.

This beginning gave way to his
first “pop” series of hand-painted
and silk-screened images. His

fascination with consumer objects I

and famous people was apparent
in his choice of objects like
“Brillo” boxes, Elvis, Liz Taylor

plays both the storyteller ' and
Azdak. As the storyteller relates
Grusha’s tale, Dowd is warm and
helpful. But as Azdak, the drunk
turned judge, he is shown as
corrupt  most of the time. The
casting of ‘the same actor in
complementary roles proves to
be a bold and very effective move.
The casting also works with
Denman’s Shasava and Bandit. A

captivating paradox rises from

Denman being an aggressor of
Grusha’s in the Bandit, but as
Shasava, he is partly the reason
why Grusha is there in the first
place.

In fact, the success of the play
has to be credited to Pitt’s‘ skillful
production and not to Brecht’s
script. I

Scenes such as Grusha meeting
Simon Shasava at the river are
especially noteworthy. The poor
woman has sacrificed, tromped
across the Asian mountain ranges
and kept a torch lit for this man as
he fought, but she allows him to
run off without her explanation
of why she married Joseph
Beidle’s character.

There are elements of the Brecht

play that may puzzle the audience,
such as why Grusha’s brother
would rather make Grusha marry
the peasant rather than stand up
to his wife, ‘who is disgraced by
the child’s apparent illegitimacy.
But all in all, Pitt’s production of
The Caucasian Cballe Circle rises
above these few inadequacies
and captivates the audience for
the majority of the three hours.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Chris Kuzneski
Staff ‘Writer

The Four Horsemen. Knute
Rockne. The Gipper. Tradition.
In the history of college
football, no school can even come
close to matchingthe glory and
tradition that Notre Dame has
amassed throughout the years.
Considering the Fighting Irish
have won 17 national titles and
seven ‘Heisman Trophies, one
can’t’ help but be amazed.
Unfortunately for the Irish,

however, the world of college
athletics is notbased on tradition,
and the ‘fact that Johnny Lujack
won a Heisman Trophy in 1947
will have no. bearing on this
Saturday’s game between the No.
1 Fighting Irish and the 7th-ranked’
Panthers.

Pitt senior defensive back Dan

Crossman agrees. “Their tradition.

doesn’t make us nervous. We
have “our own tradition here at
Pitt." S '

Panthers, however‘, is the
incredible amount of talent that
Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz
has managed to accumulate in
his brief career with the Irish.
Tony Rice, Chris Zorich and Ned

§6lcaf have” each igarneréd 7All1 ' S

American considerations, but,
perhaps the one player that Pitt

. worries about the most is Raghib

l

Ismail, known as “The Rocket.”

“We have some things to
confuse ‘The Rocket’ a little bit
and make him off-key. It will be

The World Series trivialized by quozlee

Nearly 26 years ago, the 9~1 Pitt
Panther football team opted not

to play their final game of the.

season against Penn State in
deference to a national tragedy
which has come to be one of the
most historic events on the planet.
That was the year former President
John F. Kennedy was
assassinated.

4 As a result, Pitt was denied a
major bowl bid and was out of
'post—season competition. Many
‘people wonder why Pitt pursued
this course of action and gave up
such a successful season.

But in retrospect, doesn’t a

bowl bid during the year“ of a

major national tragedy seem a bit
trivial? While the entire country

’ was feeling the aftershocks of a

presidential assassination, Pitt
chose to respect the eventin its
own way.

And in 1980, while a_ nation is
still feeling the aftershocks of the
worst earthquake since 1906, a
quake which was the second
highest ever recorded on the
Richter scale in San Francisco,
doesn’t playing the World Series
seem a bit trivial?

It is a bit ironic that the two
teams competing in this series

‘even more difficult

What does concern the‘

atough chore for us. He has the
chance to take it all the way every
time he touches the ball,”
Crossman said.

What makes stopping Ismail
is the
multitude of positions that he has
played over the course of ._ the
year. Since “The Rocket” has lined
up as a ﬂanker, a split end, a ‘slot

back and a tailback, the defense

never knows where he will turn
up next. ‘

The Panthers are sure that
they will findlsmail on special
teams, which will result in some
changes by the Panthers.

“In the past against Notre
Dame, we contained Tim Brown

fairly well, and last year we '

contained both Ricky Watters and
Raghib Ismail. It's. all going to
depend on the ‘game situation as

far as what we do, ” said Crossman. I

“We’re certainly not going to kick
the ball to him in the middle of
the ﬁeld and say, ‘GK, it's all you.’,

We’re not going to give him the '

ball on a silver platter.” t V
Even if Pitt is able tocontain

_“The Rocket” on kick returns,

their problems will not end. Their
next task will be controlling the
offensive wizardry of Irish
quarterback Tony Rice.

Rice presents the Panther

defense with many of the same I
. problems that West Virginia

quarterback Major Harris did. Rice
has the gift of turning a small gain
into a big play. a ,
“Tony Rice is a great athlete
and the obvious leader of the

I are from cities that are literally

minutes from each other —the

area which suffered the most’ ’

damage from the earthquake; the
area which will spend years and
probably billions of dollars
attempting to recover from the
damage sustained. P S

 

 

The World Series took a back
seat to major news coverage of
the quake. The P delay or
cancellation of the following
games was the least concern of
anyone who heard about the
happenings in the Bay Area. All
of the sudden, we were wi messing

'a double—tie-red freeway which

collapsed on top of numerous
motorists, a section of the Bay
Bridge which collapsed, gas fires,
homeless people, injured people,
dead people: a major national
disaster.

PAGE 15

offense,” said Riddick.

That seems obvious, but is
there any special technique for
stopping Rice? “Yeah, you tackle
him,” Riddick said.

Junior defensive tackle Marc
Spindler isn’t really concerned
about Rice’s big-play capabilities.
“I don't think any team can be
intimidated at this level. What’s
he going to do? Run over me or
something?”

The Irish have won theirlast
19 games, and Rice has had an
important role in every victory

 

 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1989

Pitt ready for the ‘#1’ challenge of the season

As’Coach Gottfried sees it,_the
Irish count on Rice to roll up
some
numbers in order to top the
exorbitant amount of yardage that
their defense allows.

This brings up an interesting
point. Does ‘Notre Dame have a
weak defense?

“They make a lot of mistakes

. in their secondary,” said Pitt split

end Baron‘ Jackson, “but they
make up for it with a lot of big
plays.”

Last week in Notre Dame’s

impressive offensive-

28-24 win over USC, the Irish“

allowed Trojan QB Todd
Marinovich to throw for 333 yards
on 33 completions, but they
intercepted the usually accurate
Marinovich three times.

Coach Holtz expects to see

Pitt utilizing the same type of ~

offense that USC used. last week.

A “They both start redshirt freshman

quarterbacks who throw the ball
very effectively. Van Pelt has been
awfully impressive. Like" Todd

Marinovich, he is very accurate,” '

Holtz said

   

1

Pitt quarterback, Alex Van Pelt, needs the avoid the Notre Dame rush if the Panthers are '
going to be successful against the number 1 ranked Fighting Irish on Saturday; ’

We were hearing these reports
instead of descriptions of Will Clark ’s
tonsillitis, somebody’s pre—game .
jitters, whether the Giants could
stage a comeback, etc. We saw
playersholding their children outside
Candlestick Park wanting nothing
more than to get their families home
safely, and thanking God and other
deities that they were safe and spared

from any ‘personal injury.

What does major league baseball
hope to accomplish by continuing
the World Series? A, morale booster
for the Bay area, the nation? Is it
simply tradition to play the World

Series?
Whatever their rationale, the
ciestru ction, both tangible and

intangible, to people’s lives, is

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

Coaches say teams 
stack-up fairly Well

It is written quite clearly in the coaches’ bible: thou shalt
use the word “impressive” when referring to Saturday’s
opposition. Likewise, it is written that thou shalt use the
word “unimpressive” when referring to one’s own team.
Both Lou Holtz and Mike Gottfried subscribed to these
scriptures during their press conferences on Tuesday.

Holtz continues todeny the success of his undefeated,
top-ranked Fighting Irish team. Also, Holtz complains that
his team has been “fighting an uphill battle land his team is}
not able to sustain momentum.” As Pittsburgh sportscaster
Myron Cope would say, “hmm, ha.”

Holtz elaborates on the Irish success, “It certainly hasn’t
been easy for us this year, despitethe fact were 7-0  we
still‘don’t throw the ball as well as most people we play...

; something no World Series victory

by their home team can cure. Long
after the As or the Giants walk away

. as baseballs 1989 World Champions,

the devastation remains.

Maybe major league baseball
should take a lesson from Plus 1965
athletic department. Call it off.

The momentum is lost. There is
always next year. Think about it.
Just before game three of the series,
an entire city was leveled by the
second-largest earthquake in San
Francisco. Baseball surely can wait.

There’s no way we can continue to turn the ball over five
times the way we did against USC -and expect. to survive
against the people we still" have left to play.” Despite Holtz’
bad-mouthing, the fact remains that the “Irish are able to
have five turnovers and defeat top-ranked teams — a nice
luxury.

last year’s (_l6i.2 average yards passing and_253.l yards
rushing per game for a total average of 419.4 yards per
game), Holtz replied, “unfortunately similarities exist with
talent. [Pitt has} more of a pro-style passing game. [Pitt QB
Alex] Van Pelt has tremendous ball-handling ability.” Van -
Pelt has completed 100 passes on 165 attempts for an

Isrnail reaking havoc on opposing defenses A few II1O1‘€

By Rob Codispot
Staff Writer

He is faster than a speeding
bullet [clocked at 4.28,in the 40-
yard dash]. Just as versatile as Bo
Jackson. Able to solve opposing
special teams’ coverages in a
single second. It’s a bird; it’s a
plane  it’s Superman!

Well, not exactly. But to Notre
Dame, Raghib Ismail is Superman.
To Fighting Irish opponents, he
is Public Enemy No. 1.

In his brief stint as an Irishman,

. the tailback/receiver/returner has

racked‘ up some eye-popping
numbers. Like this one: a 19.1-

.yard average every time he
H touches the football. Or this one:

1 53.4 all.-purpose yards per game,

~ which ranks ninth in the country.

Or this one: he is already the
career record—holder at Notre
Dame for kickoff return
touchdowns with four, breaking
former Heisman Trophy winner

Tim Brown's record.

Just how much does “The
Rocket” concern Panther coaches
and players? Very much.

“We’re very concerned,” Pitt
head coach Mike Gottfried said at
Tuesday’s press conference.
“Raghib Ismail is an outstanding
player  a weapon.”

“He’s a great threat,” senior
safety Dan Crossman added. “He
has a chance to take it all the way

, every time he touches the ball.
‘ The thing that separates him from

receivers like [Syracuse’s] Rob
Moore and [Boston Co1lege’s]

Marcus Cherry is his great speed.

Both are great receivers, but
neither of them [has] the speed of
Ismail.” _

He is Notre Dame quarterback
Tony Rice’s favorite receiver with
19 catches for 595 ‘yards.
Crossman says the Panthers will
utilize a variety of defenses to
keep the Irish offense off—balance. ‘

“We’ve got a lot of things

we’re going to try to do to confuse
them a little bit and keep them
off-key," Crossman said. “We're

I going to involve everybody, not

only the corners. [Ismaill will see
some one-on-one coverage, but
we’re going to get as many people
involved with him as we can."
Notre Dame also uses his
speed in the backfield, combining
him with Ricky Watters and
Anthony Johnson to give them a
formidable threesome.

“They put him in the backfield
to get him the ball,” Crossman
said. “He’s a Tim Brown-type
player; when [Brown] went to the
backfield, he was there to get the

ball. They do whatever they can

to get him the ball.”-

He also ranks ﬁrst in the nation
in kickoff returns, averaging just
un-der 40 yards per return. Ismail
has returned three opponent’s
kicks for touchdowns this year

and has five combined kick I

returns for TDs in his young

career, only three away from the
NCAA record. Crossman had
nothing but praise for Ismail’s
special teams accomplishments.

‘‘He’s a great special teams‘
player,” he said. “He’s beat
[Michigan and Air Force] with
returns. It’s going to be a great
test for us.”

Ismail nearly single-handedly
beat Michigan earlier this year
with two returns for touchdowns.
Gottfried said the danger Ismail
presents on kickoffs has caused
teams to totally abandon the
thought of kicking to him.

“I don’t think anybody has
kicked to him after he did what
he did [against Michigan] with
the kickoff returns, ” Gottfried said.
“Air Force kicked to him, and he
brought one back la S6-yard punt
return] on them. Last week, [USCl
kicked to him early and then he
had the long run [a 58-yard return
to set Notre Dame’s first
touchdown] and they quit kicking

, to him, too.”

Crossman said Pitt has had
success in the past against Notre
Dame on special teams,
containing Brown two years ago
and Ismail and Watters last year.
And Pitt may have a couple of
things up their sleeve to keep the
ball out of Ismai1’s hands.

“[The coaching staff] is
working on a lot of different
things,” Crossman said. “Maybe
we’ll squib kick  we won't
know for sure until game time
how we’re going to handle it."

“You can’t keep the ball away
from him,” Gottfried said. “They

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, October 26, 1989

17*

Fans speak out on the streets ofPz't2f Panther country 

Editor’s Note: The following are
studentanalysas oftbissarurdays
Pitt-Notre Dame contest in South
Bend. These are random survey
results.

Dave Lucarelli, CAS, 1991

I think Pitt is going to receive
their toughest challenge so far
this season. The home-field
advantage is going to be the key
factor in the game for Notre Dame.
If the game were in Pitt Stadium,
1 think our
psychologically beat Notre Dame,
resulting in a victory. But the

crowd could ‘

same situation (in South Bend) is
going to defeat us this weekend.

Steve Davis, CAS, 1993 ‘

I feel Pitt has a good enough
defense to shut down the Notre
Dame option, and that will put
them in a lot of passing situations.
Offensively, our line is too good
for their defense, and Van Pelt
should have plenty of time to
throw, and our running game
will lead us to victory.

Dean Androutsopoulos, CAS,
1993

Irish

Continued from page 15
impressive .606 completion
percentage and 1,414 total passing
yards. On Pitt’s defense, Holtz
commented, “the defense is better
this year than last. There is more
depth, especially in the front four.”
. Uncharacteristically, Holtz
praised ND quarterback Tony
Rice, who has 829 total yards in
the air and 535 on the ground, as
“productive and consistent.”

“I was impressed with [Notre
Dame] last year, let alone this
yeah They are a very tough
assignment. They have an
impressive 19-game winning
“streak, including 14 at home.

When they turn the ball over v

[excessively], they still win the
ball game. As far as the emotional

factor goes, the advantage is

theirs,.’f..Gottfried-sai.d. _ _ . , .

Gottfried displayed a concerned
expression while describing the
Irish offense. “The difference in
Notre Dame’s option [this year] is
their options. They stretch you
and run everything conceivable
against you.”

Describing the Irish defense,
Gottfried said, “no one runs
against them. They force you to

throw the football. Miami threw
for 420 yards [last year] and didn’t
win the football game.”

I Gottfried was somewhat
optimistic when talking about
Pitt. “We needed the open date to

accomplish certain, things in’

practice and give our injured
players needed rest and get as
healthy as we can. The running
backs are 100 percent.

“We like where we’re at record-
wise, but we don’t like the
inconsistencies. We don’t talk
about the wins or losses; we just
try to get better,” Gottfried said.
Gottfried also said Pitt has not
done anything special regarding
excessive penalties. Pitt has
amassed a total of 51 penalties
this season for 449 yards,
including 13 against Navy for 90

. yards, seven in the first quarter
playing .

alone. “Our not
[consistently] is a concern of all
the coaches,” Gottfried said.

Gottfried summed up a
simplified Panther attitude this
way, “[The players] should enjoy
this. It’s why you come [to play]
at the University of Pittsburgh.
This is what It’s all about.”

Pitt has the talent to beat Notre
Dame. Notre Dame has been
getting lucky, especially last week
against USC. If we control the
game and cause Notre Dame to
make mistakes, Pitt will come out
on top. Also, when Pitt destroys
Notre Dame, they havea great
shot at the No. 1 ranking.

Vas Scoumis, CAS, 1992

Dame, winner of their last 19,
ranked No. 1 and playing at home
[has] got to be everyone’s pick
...but I’m going with Pitt to
dominate defensively, allowing

Tony “Loss of Yardage” Rice only
six yards rushing. The “Rocket”
will crash and Watters will drown.
“Air” Van Pelt will have a season
high 964 yards passing. Curvin
Swervin’ will heel up with 177
yards. Pitt 42, Notre Dame 6.

Jeff Kaplan, CAS, 1990

I think the Panthers can win
the game if they stop Tony Rice.
If they can contain him and make
him throw the ball, they should
be able to win. Offensively, I
think Pitt should be able to throw
the ball on the Irish and will

probably have to rely on passing

9 because Pitt will have a tough

time running. I think Pitt should
win if they avoid the mistakes
they often have made.

Sonia Henze, CGS, 1992 I

I believe that Notre Dame will
crush Pitt because they have a
team dedicated to winning. To
Notre Dame, tradition is
important, and winning is
everything. Notre Dame also has
more sophisticated plays, and
they are better in overall quick-
thinking situations.
