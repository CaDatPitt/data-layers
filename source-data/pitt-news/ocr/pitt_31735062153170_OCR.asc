letter’ under recent date:

_ “Enclosed please 'ﬁnd [check ‘and

the mountains of Eastern Tennessee

rendered, but the ﬁnancial returns
are such that my oﬁening fo‘i'“- this
estimable cause is paltry as com-
pared with what I should like to
give. '

'— Pitt ‘people well remember Dr,
Aufeene Marley Jamison. The Medic-

earnest and scaipoazble physician, one

who views her profession as a real
»‘ opportunity to serve humanity. Since
graduation she has devoted herself
exclusively ‘to medical missionary
work. considering her service oppor-
tunity as the real pay. An,d_'yet she
subspribes ‘liberally’ to “Alumni Hal-1."

and most liked Pitt students in the
last decade and ‘his death came as a
s_e_ve~re shock, as few knew that he
had been ailing. « Wallace Thomas had
been in rather poor health for several
years. “I-Matt” suffered’ a breakdown
during the early years of his college
career and this eventually led to com-
plications which ended“ his life. His
widow, parents, two sisters and a
brother, “Jim,” a former student of
Pitt, survive. V ' 

boys who had to work. hard to secure
an education. The Secretary knew
them both from their high school days
and was intimatelyacquainted ,with
their circumstances and strugglesto
get through Pitt. Marshall was a
graduate of Allegheny High schools,
class of '11. He entered the Univer-
sity thé following. year.a.nd graduated
last June from the Medical school,
after years of hard plugging. At the
time of his‘ death he was serving as
interne in"tl1e- West Penn Hospital.
He was chosen for membership in the
Alpha Omega Alpha and Omricon
Delta. Kappa honorary fraternities and
the Phi Rho ‘Sigma Medical fraternity
and was also affliated with Belleﬁeld

Good at Half-Mile. _

During the early days of his career
at Pitt, “.Mat.t” was an exceptional
track performer, specializing. in
half mile event. When at his best,
he could do it around two, minutes.
He was captain of the University team.-

. He and his brother, “Jim,” who was

a sprinter, entered, Pitt at the same
time. They had both learned -to love
‘track athletics while at high school
and while there were frequent visitors

‘ at the old W. U. P. track in Allegheny
« where they trained with Dr. Homer

Roe, Dr. Quincy Banbury and other
university tgack athletes of those‘
days. Everyone, liked “Ma_tt“ and
“‘Jim,” because‘ they were hard work-.
ers, they were modest about their
athletic ability, and they ,had} the
right spirit: “Matt" especially was 3.

came asa result of special effort. He-
studied athletics just_ as The studied
medicine. And he made good as an
athlete and a; student. ' :

MEDLEY RELAY RACE

The Kappa Sigs took home their
second cup of the inter-fraternity
series of track competitions last Fri-

A day when they won the Sprint‘ Med-

ley Relay. The relay consisted of two

one-laps. twotwo-laps and one three- ‘

laps. The Kappa Sig team was com

posed of W. Ryman and Hartnett for I

the short distance, Rylander and Man-
deville for the two-laps and Shea for
the quarter. They won not by dint of
Shea’s superiority in the quarter, but
rather by having the best balanced
team. . Their sprinters were the

fastest one—1ap men, while their two-,

lap men more than held their own.

The «Sigma. Chis were not far out- -
done by the Kappa Sigs and came

through with the second fastest time,
less than live seconds‘ slower than
Shea & Cp. Everyteam ran against

time and as thegsigma Chis were the.

ﬁrst to run, they hung up a record
that looked for the time hard to beat.
They ‘had a well-balanced team, while

‘Martin ran one of‘ the fastest *quar—

ters of the day.’ - -

- The Phi Gamms were third. Wall
ker and Hill turned in their one-laps
in good time and Wikoﬁ hung on to
his quarter in ﬁne shape. Davies and

-Small ran the two-laps and ﬁnished

well, although both weakened consid-
erably on their second lap.

Phi Delta Theta was fourth, two
seconds behind the Phi Gamms and
10 in the rear of the Kappa Sigs. The
one-laps were run in fast time by Bow-
ser and Reed, while Capers came
through with a pretty two-laps. Ben-

. nett ran one of the best quarters of

the afternoon. A
Allen was star of Alpha -Phi Alpha,

who ﬁnished inﬁfth place,-a fraction

of a second behind the‘Ph-i Delts.‘ Del-

ta Tau Delta was sixth, having a well-

balanced team without any particular
The same could be said
for Lambda Chi Alpha and Sigma Al-
pha AMu, _who ﬁnished seventh and
eighth_respectively. ' ' _
With eight fraternities competing
with full teams the event was the big-
gest held so far. Interest was at as

high, if not higher, pitch than in any .

of the previous events. The quality of
the event was just as good compara-
tively as in the broad jump and shot-
put. -Several men did very well in
the one lap "and showed possibilities of
being developed into sprinters. Those
who did the best work are being
urged to come out regularly, as . the
100-yard dash is a woefully weak spot
on the-track team. It was harder to
judge the two-lap men, as it took a
man who had been in training to ﬁn-
ish the twolaps without weakening.

, At least ﬁve men, Shea, Martin, Ben-
nett, Allen and VVikoﬁ ran pretty quar-
ters. While the individual times were
not taken, all of those men ran under
a minute, which is good time for the

indoor track. The record for the track .

‘is: 56 4-5. The track itself is fast, but
the 12 turns to the quarter mile make
real fast time impossible. '

There will be no event during ex.
amination week, but the week follow-
ing, February? 11, the I_ntermediAatc

‘ Medley“.Re1ay will be’ run. This race

will consist of two men each running
two laps, two men each running three

' laps, and one" man running six laps,

‘or a. half mile. This race will be con-
ducted in the same way as the Sprint
Medley, the teams running against
time, at any time between 3:00 and
5:30. ‘ - '

In the summary below,‘ the time of
each team is given and the runners

stream.

passers at Motor lSqua:1fell Garden,
last Friday, -44 to 43," While the Pitt
Freshmen beat , the crack Kiski team
29 to 28. A Both games were exciting
from start to ﬁnish and decided by a.
single point. The spectators were on
edge throughout. Sensational shoot-
ing-' was the outstanding feature and
received much applaus from the
crowd.‘ ‘

The Dlaoiing oi‘. “Red”._ Byers and
“Don” Whiting was of the spectacu-
lar kind. Byers was ‘all over the
ﬂoor and played one of the best games
this season, caging ﬁve goals from the
ﬂoor a.t difficult angles.  '
Whiting, leader of the Ohioans, was
Mariet_ta’s individual star and scorer.
His ﬂoor work was exceptionally good
and his shooting was wonderful, net-
