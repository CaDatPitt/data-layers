Sex Bias Major Issue

by MICHAEL CLINTON

Dr. Sharon Johnson. assistant
professor in Pitt's School of Medi-
cine. has won a preliminary in-
junction against the University
on the issue of denied tenure. and

thus will retain her position on

the faculty.

Johnson filed suit in February.
1973. against Chancellor Posvar
and three officials-in the Medi-
cal School regarding a committee
decision of tenure denial.

The civil suit charged that the
decision to deny tenure was made
in a manner which violated the

Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1966. '

The suit also charged violations
of the First and 14th Amendments.

According to Johnson, "The
Academic Freedom and Tenure
Committee also found evidence of
sex bias and of harassment by the
Medical School.“ I

The court ruling of May 29. out-
lined four important points on-the
ruling of Dr. Johnson's case.

The'court found that( 1) the‘

A ballot concerning tenure was
recently distributed to members
of the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences, and judging from the re-
sponse, faculty members are not
satisfied with current tenure po-
licies. - ' y

The two motions, one of which
concerned the anonymous com-
mittees wh make tenure recom-
mendations to the Dean, and the
second of which opposed the in-
stitution of a quota system. were
both overwhelmingly approved
by the faculty.

Dr. Florencio Asenjo, professor
of mathematics and proposer of
the anonymous committee motion,
was not “surprised” with the out-
come of the voting. “It was a
clear cut issue, and the obvious
thing to do. The people who make
decisions concerning tenure
should be accountable for their
actions, and the should be made
known, for these committees ad-
vise on proposals of tenure. At the
moment, if a person .is refused
tenure, he still has doubt in his
mind whether the decision was
made because of a conflict of per-

‘ V sonalities,” said Asenjo.

Jerome Rosenberg. Dean of the

Faculty of Arts and Sciences de— .

clined to comment on the balloting.

and City Ministries will speak on

For independent Win

by MARK ISKOVITZ

The Pitt Young Democrats
('PYD). according to Frank Luc-
chino. helped him become the
only independent to win a Demo-
cratic nomination for City Coun-
cil in the May primary.’

Lucchino explained. "It was
hard to get an ordinary citizen in-
terested in a primary race for
City Council. But the YD‘s took to
it right away. They had the same
enthusiasm I did."

“The role that the ‘PYD’s play-
ed was not just one of running
errands. They were always in-
volved in major decisions of the
campaign.” Ron Brown and Sam
Rosenzweig, the past and present
presidents of the PYD, played a
“particularly important” part in
the campaign, according to Luc-
chino. '

"Ron was in charge of canvass-
ing. He reviewed the various
areas of the city and decided
which areas we‘d canvass. Sam
took part in canvassing also. His
other area of primevresponsibil—
ity was the balloon crew. which

THE FOLLOWING are two proposals recently voted on by the Faculty
of Arts and Scinces. The first proposal was made by Professor Flor-
encia Asenio of/ the Department of Mathematics and the second
by Professor Van Beck Hall of the Department of History. .

I. It is the sense of the Faculty of Arts.and Sciences that the
existence of anonymous committees to advise the Dean of the Fac-
ulty of Arts and Sciences on matters of tenure and promotion is
inconsistent with the proper and responsible operation of a univer-
sity. Anonymous committees subvert the principle of accountabil-
ity to which every member of the University is subject, whether in
an executive or advisory role. It is therefore requested that the Dean
terminate the anonymous status of the committees in question. A

2. The Faculty of Arts and Sciencesdpposes the institution of all
quota system of any kind as a standard for limiting promotions to
tenure. We believe that such ‘standards should be qualitative and
not quantitative and that both faculty and administration should
concentrate on perfecting qualitative standards for tenure choices.

Rosenzweig and Brown also felt
"enthusiastic" about the cam-
paign. Rosenzweig said, "In a lot

see the pieces falling together in
this campaign. We got the mo-
mentum."

GI I Needs College Skills,

Veterans Head Stresses 

A by EUGENE SANDERS

"It's almost impossible to go
to school on the GI Bill," claims
George Sell, Veterans‘ president
atPitt.

The GI Bill grants a single vet-
eran $225 per month while in col.-
lege. "That money." said Sell.
"must cover tuition and living
expensesf‘ ‘ -

Sell claimed that “because the
GI Bill provides insufficient funds,

. many vets can't afford to go to‘

college.”

Sell suggested that the Vietnam,
vet be granted more funds and a
college preparatory program. if
needed.

"The program," said Sell.
"would prepare the vet academ-
ically for college and give him the
confidence to go on to college."

For the vet not going to college,
Sell claimed that “his chances on
the job "market would be very
tough.” -

"When a guy comes out of the
service." said Sell, "he often has
trouble getting his old job back.
Chances are that the vet hasn‘t
picked up any skills in the service
that will get. him a civilian job."

  Venetian Treasures /vlayBe Saved

by KAREN BURGIO

Thanks to some concerned Pitt students and art
and ecology minded people throughout the world.
Venice and its art treasures might be saved.

According to the June 11 edition of Time, the

Italian Parliament has appropriated $510 million

over the next five years and has passed a law that
states. "The safeguarding of Venice and of its la-
goon is declared to be a problem of pre-eminent

Pleased with the announcement was associate

Funds to Organizations

by DREW PORVAZNIK

The Student Government Board (SGB) passed three organiza-
tional budgets at its Tuesday meeting. while one budget was sent back
to the committee level for review.

The budget for the Owl was passed with a guarantee that a future
allocation would be granted if the publication needs additional funds.
The Veterans at Pitt organization had a $100 budget approved by the
board.

In addition, the SGB passed an emergency fund for itself. This
fund would be used for an August mailing to all undergraduates in-
forming them of the work of the SGB.

At the meeting, the budget for the Pitt Chess Club, which amount-
ed to $495 was sent back to the Allocations Committee for review. The
SGB rejected the $300 for traveling expenses for the Pan-Am Tourna-
ment in Atlanta, Ga.

During the meeting, SGB President Rege Kaufmann briefed the
board on his recent trip to Harrisburg to attend Legislative Day. There
Kaufmann, along with several University officials, informed state
congressmen on how activities and operations at Pitt are functioning.
Kaufmann stated that he was disappointed that only about 125 con-
gressmen were in attendance for Legislature Day.

In other areas, Kaufmann discussed the results of the Student Af-

fairs Advisory Committee (SAAC) meeting with the Chancellor.

The idea of a circus at Trees Hall was received with a negative re-
action by the Chancellor while the proposal of a rock concert at Pitt
Stadium was looked upon more favorably, according to Kaufmann.

He also reported that during the SAAC meeting. Chancellor Posvar
stated that he would look into the proposals of re-surfacing the tennis
courts, having longer gym hours at Trees Hall. and improving the light-
ing around the Cathedral.

In addition, there was a discussion on implementing a yearly inven-
tory of all equipment purchased by Student Government in order to
keep track of what equipment is available.

NIXON’S ECONOMICS

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate
I)emocrats have declared Presi-
dent Nixon's economic controls a
failure and are now pushing legis-
lation to freeze prices and wages
for 90 days.

In a unanimous vote. the Senate
Democratic Caucus vowed to take
immediate steps to bring the pro-
posals to a floor vote by attach-
ing it to any appropriate bill.

The resolution co-sponsor, Wil-
liam Proximire, D-Wis., said the
best vechicle might be a bill rais-
ing the ceiling on the national
debt because it would be difficult
for Nixon to veto.

Meanwhile, the administration
tightened some price regulations
for hospitals and nursing homes.
but promised an easing of con-
trols over the construction indus-
try.

STATE CRIMINAL CODE

HARRISBURG (AP 1' — A new
state crime code became law
yesterday. It wipes out a 112-year
old code widely criticized for al-
lowing discrepancies in sentenc-
ing.

Some ironies in the old code
were: burning down a school was
subject to imprisonment for 10
years while burning down a barn
brought 20 years, and bribery of
a judge brought one year but brib-
ery of an athlete, 10 years.

FEDERAL GAS BILL

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ A bill
requiring the Nixon administra-
tion to draw up a nation-wide gas-
oline and oil distribution plan was
passed by the Senate. 85-1 Tues-
day and sent to the House of Rep-
resentatives.

The bill proposes to equalize
gasoline and oil distribution for
gas station owners, independent
refineries and consumers across
the nation. This means that no
region would be rationed more gas
and oil than another.

The bill also contains govern
mental regulations concerning the

In recent‘ years. one of the

for the Henry Clay Frick family.

Her list of customers include

Candace Bergen and Jack Nichol-

-And now. addingito her list of
accomplishments, White has writ-

ten a cookbook which would grace
any culinary library.

As a child White lived in Lang-
holm, Scotland and learned to
cook during the second World

iWar (“Almost as an act of des-
peration,” she says). She came to

the U.S. in 1961 and worked as

a cook at ‘the Sheraton-Hamp-V

shire Inn on the Vineyard for
several years.

Shortly thereafter. White. en-.

couraged by friends and family.
opened the Scottish Bakehouse.
She and her son found a little
‘house two miles west of Vineyard‘
Haven which seemed at the time

But the business grew quick-

cramped quarters. The following

they undertook the rebuilding
and expansion of the Bakehouse
themselves.

p Pitt Debciter to Represent U.S. in Debate Tour

By DAVE MAJERNIK »

The importance of debate was '

demonstrated during the 1960
Presidential campaign ‘when John
Kennedy faced Richard Nixon in
a series of televised. debates.
Many political experts believe
these debates turned the tables
in favor of Kennedy.

Today, another John Kennedy
is still winning honors through
debate. John Edward Kennedy,
a 1973 Pitt graduate, has been
a member of the William Pitt
Debate Union for the past four
years. b .

Recently. in competition in
Chicago, Kennedy and John Sax-
on of the University of North’
Carolina, were chosen to repre-
sent the United States for a de-
bating tour of Great Britain from
January to March, 1974.

This tour will include ‘ap-
proximately 25 debates against-un-
iversities in England, A Ireland.
Scotland, and Wales with ses-
sions at Oxford and Cambridge.

22, a resident of
Shadyside, said he has debated
since his high school »days at
Central Catholic‘ in Oakland,
where he competed in many big
tournament debates and was a
finalist in several.

he never became a member of

in the lesser tournaments. He was
often called upon at the last
minute to replace a sick debater

"I was like an old war horse
which they trotted out whenever
they needed me.“ he said. i

In preparing for the British
tour. Kennedy said he had to note

"the difference between American

and British styles of debating.

. , “The American style,” he said,

“emphasizes problem-solving,

. presentation of evidence, requires

extensive research and prepara-
tion,. and the debaters speak very
quickly to present as much evi-

dence as they can in the allotted"

time. American debaters, conse-
quently, are often notpolished

before an audience since most
American debates take place

ability to adapt quickly to the sit-
uation. Often there is inflamma-
tory rhetoric and jokes. and

speaking flare and style is con-

sidered important.“

Kennedy said he finds the Bri-
tish style more interesting. and at-
tributed his current victory to his
ability to adapt to that style.

During the competition in Chi-
cago, he said, debaters were
judged on the basis of a personal
interview, a half-American, half-
British type of debate, and a com-
petitive after-dinner speech.

"Many championship Ameri-
can ‘college-circuit tournament

nedy.

more of a foreign exchange
where the debaters will be. good-
will ambassadors, and there will
be less emphasis on competition.

While a member of the Wil-
liam Pitt Debate Union, Kennedy
said he enjoyed doing research.

"In my Freshman year. our
topic was the poverty programs.
and I learned a great deal about
rural poverty that I wouldn't‘oth-

EDITORIAL

3 In order tocomply with the by-law of the Committee on

Student Organizations which states that no organization shall
discriminate on the basis of race, religion or national origin. the

Black Action Society recently included the following clause in

l  their constitution "(BASI does not exclude participation from

any student upon this campus so long as their. goals are in ac-
cordance with ours.” The BAS went on to state that non—black

 members will not be accorded the right to vote.

This last qualification is clearly in violation of the CS0 by-

_laws, as well as the laws of the Commonwealth. A constitution

which accords full participation to all black students and parti-

 cipation for non-blacks only up to the point of policy determina-
 l_ ,_ tion is surely discriminating on the basis of race.

In statements made by officials of BAS and the Student

ii Government Board. it became apparent that this latest conces-

sion on the part of the BAS is only temporary and that changes

  ~may be made in the b_v—laws which would facilitate "legal" dis-

crimination on the basis or race.
We adamantly oppose this initial viol'ation of the CS0 by-

ij,/_ laws and are in strong opposition to-any. alteration in the by-
 laws which would sanction further discrimination.

Discrimination‘ of any kind has no place on this campus.
Most especially. it has no place in a student organization which

 ;_receives funds from those students against whom it is discrim-
’ -; inating.

Any" student organization which is recognized by the CS0 is

 fautomatically eligible for allocations. These allocationscome
  from the student activities fees., which are collected from all
 ‘Pitt students, male" and female, black and white. That these stu-
ylliidents should have a voice in all those organizations and activ-
, V l_ ities which function with their money is self-evident.

xlt is not th'e.purpose' of this editorial to question the need

 for an organization such as BAS——this is above dispute. What
 we are arguing for are clear—cut guidelines for recognizing stu-

 

'i-..~.dgent organizations which oppose any form of discrimination and

‘acknowledge the reciprocal nature of any social contact.

The Car Punk Crisis

I have been under the impres-
sion fora long time that some-
thing needs to be done about the
brainless, destructive members of
the car culture. I do notwish to
indict all auto enthusiasts, just a
good portion of them. Specifically.
the “car punks".

Much of my attitude has an en-
vironmental basis. The street I
l_ive on, while no major artery. is
relatively wide, flat. and well-
paved. (I should note that the as-

phalt was laid about 10 to 12.

years ago — Mayor Flaherty de-
serves no credit whatsoever. )

In any case, such a nice street
is far too tempting for the speed
demon set. I live on a quarter
mile of neighborhood raceway.

But, of course. local inhabitants
have paid the price.

One night a row of cars was
smashed by some fast-driving
jer’k.

A quiet Sunday morning wit-
nessed a low-flying Chevy with-
outbrakes. _

And every day people have
heard the “chirp“ of spinning
tires and the rumble of hopeless-
ly hopped-up engines.

Add to these the bad encoun-
ters _I’ve had on the road with
auto-maniacs and you’ll find a
rather powerful set of reasons
why I’d like to see car punks
slowed down.” '

When I was much younger.
I thought that throwing lighted
firecrackers into the offending
automobiles was the solution. I

still think it would be fun. but I .
realize now that it’s no wayto‘

BAS “Vital ”

To Campus

by BROTHER KABA

. The Black Action Society has so
far presented no opposition in
programming or working with
other student organizations. The
organization has only stressed
it‘s organizational commitment
and first priority as the welfare
of ~ black people and black stu-
dents.

It should be noted that the pro-
grams of BAS have been not only

. relevant and in tune with national

consciousness, but also serves" to
expose white students who may be
uninformed and unfamiliar with
black consciousness, culture, and
lifestyles.

This exposure is done within
the protective environment of the
University. where the students
can be at ease, and learn the true
co-operative communalistic na-
ture of black people united under
spirits of love and dedication.
There is a cultural difference.
The service BAS provides to black
students is totally unique. and

ICOUl.d only be served by such an
organization. These cultural dif-
ferences must be stressed and re-
spected before there can be a
flow of communications between
organizations of different prior-
ities. There can be no unification
withoutunderstanding BAS pro-
vides the only organizational op-
portunity for this, on this campus.

Another View

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN
News Editor

The recent disagreement between the Student Government and the 5 ''

Black Action Society is so multifaceted and far ranging in its legal mo-
ral and political implications. that any brief discussion of it will almost
inevitably be incomplete.

The issues raised by the dispute, however. may be dealt with most

effectively from the political perspective. for the arguments from_
morality. economics, and legality are unfortunately ambiguousand fail ‘

to recognize the basic nature of the BAS stance on. permitting white
students to take a full membership in the organization.

Any group that is discriminated against or repressed is, of course,
far moreaware of this fact than the group that is discriminating or
repressing. Black Americans and black peoples anywhere in the world
form such a repressed group, and as such have a greater awareness of
the problems associated with this state than do whites.

One result of this awareness must inevitably be a desire and a
need to find a sense of unity. a sense of group dignity, which can only
be achieved by working and relaxing with members of one’s own group.
This does not mean a total cessation of relations with members of other
groups, but does imply limiting relationships with other groups to a
considerable extent.

This limitation of dealings should probably be seen as dealing with
other groups only to the extent that their specific goals coincide with
those of thelgroup in'question. Or more simply, it would seem reason-
able that the BAS should be willing to work with individuals that are
involved in the same issue. But it does not mean that the BAS should
be willing to become another political organization concerned with
working for “the freedom of all mankind." -

The above conclusions follow naturally fro/m the premise that a
group who is repressed has the apparent goal of “the freedom of all
mankind,” but has as its specific goal its own freedom, its. own sense
of dignity, its own sense of community, which is achieved by bringing
the group together.

One may, however. all to easily move from these arguments to a

much less desirable one. Simply if a groups goals are to be achieved by '

working/primarily with its own members, then one should also believe
that people from other factions are of no use whatsoever in achiev-
ing these goals. A

This is clearly fallacious (and the BAS stance in no way implies it).

Black separatism is an entirely useful and efficient device for organ’-
izing the black community, but as the BAS, clearly recognizes situa-
tions arise when individuals or groups outside‘ of the black community
have skills and resources which are useful in achieving the goals "of that
community and thus must be utilized. ‘ =

And so as a white, who trembles at playing spokesman for BAS. I
support their stance on the composition of membership. and equally

support the apparent willingness on the partof Student Government to

deal with this stance as fairly as possible.

Unfortunately, the position and title of Editor

become something to print, no more and no less.

Some little while ago, I mentioned an organi-
zation called MENSA on this page, MENSA was
not the principal subject of that small essay. but
was only mentioned in connection with «what I
feel is a commendable resurgence of interest in

card—carrying intellectuals. seemed to exemplify
all that is best in blatant elitism. entirely free of
false modesty and unashamed of its own superior-

In a spirit of malicious humor. I ended the ar-
ticle by suggesting that anyone/who was bright
enough to belong in,MENSA should be smart en-
ough to guess at the address of that august body. _

if a belated mention could be arranged.

The note concluded with a"stamped likeness of
her signature, and initials suggesting that acer-

Margot Seitelman is an official of a prestigious

Jews

fer
Jesus

By KAREN BURGIO

It is almost standard procedure
in Pittsburgh politics to mix par-
ty affiliations—to combine the
philosophies of the two. or to
completely disregard party ideals
and go it on one's own.

However. in the case of reli-
gious affiliations. the public be-
comes quite upset when the mem-
bers of one established religion
change to or add aspects of an-
other organized religion to their
beliefs.

The “Jews for Jesus” is one
such group which has come under
recent fire, especially from the
Jewish population.

“ ‘The Jews for Jesus‘ are not
true Jews. they are not loyal.“
said a secretary at Beth Shalom
Synagogue.

“Converted Jews have caused
anti—Semitic problems: they are
usually self-haters that want to be
accepted by a new community."
said a Jewish graduate student.

"It‘s better for a Jewish girl
to come home pregnant than to
admit that she believes in Christ
as the Messiah." said a conserva-
tive Jewish mother.

An ad placed in the Pitt News
last month by a national adver-
tising company listed Beth Sar
Shalom on Beacon Street, in
Squirrel Hill as the Pittsburgh
contact point for the new move-
ment.

According to Hannah Eurich. a
secretary at the center. there are

In further discussing her case,
Johnson said that the National

her as a supportive agent through-

out the case.

Until further court action. Dr.
Johnson will continue teaching
biochemistry in the School of Med-
icine. She will also continue her
research in the study of co-en-
zymes involved in biological re-

believe in Christ. However. she re-
fused to divulge information which
would allow this reporter to con-
tact them. and Eurich did not have
Jewish students committed to
Christ contact me. as she stated
she would do.

The Jews for Jesus movement
appears to be strong only on the
West Coast. where it originated.
and in the metropolitan New York
City area. Throughout the rest
of the country. only isolated pock-
ets of Jewish people who have
turned to Christ exist. and they
are not organized under the name.

interview in the Shepherd of Is-
rael. “We have been asked to ac-
cept the dogma that Judaism and
Christianity are mutually exclu-
sive categories. that one could not
be a true Jew and be a Christian.
This is what we were asked to ac-
cept on blind faith or on the ba-
sis of the opinions of some men
who had no Biblical authority
to assume that. With God‘s help
we intend to fight prejudice and
bigotry wherever we find it. even
if it is within ourselves. our fami-
lies and our own communities.

“We emphatically believe that
God did choose the Jewish people
to be a separate people, a holy
people. We believe that God chose
the Jewish people for His service,
to preach the good news of His
existence and His redemption for
all mankind. In Messiah Jesus, we
find the message of redemption
for all people.”

ing immediately accepted by Gen-
tile Christians.

Since many Jews had become
committed to Christ, the only al-
ternative was to lump themselves
into a different category, that of
“Jews for Jesus.” After all, they
still remained ethnically and cul-
turally Jewish, but believed in
Christ.

"We never said we were the
salt of the Earth." said Jews for
Jesus spokesman Moishe Rosen.
an ordained Baptist minister
with the American Board of Mis-
sions to the Jews. “These were
kids who were out of life—coun-
ter-culture people who were Jew-

are

Gentile. but. as members of the
movement say. it instills a new
awareness of what Judaism is
about. through the fulfillment of
the Old Testament prophesies.

Literature passed out by the
Jews for Jesus people, and the
organization's interesting art work
proclaim: "Jesus was the greatest
Jew of all." and “Christmas is a
Jewish holiday." Rosen complains
that many Jews “fear our beliefs
are so infectious. they won‘t even
get close to us." '

Expanding on this fear. Rosen
also spoke of bomb threats. revok-
ing visas in Israel and denial of
the right of freedom of expression
in college papers throughout the
country.

“Parents don’t put much empha-
sis on Judaism,” said a Pitt stud-
ent interested in becoming a rab-
bi. “So if it’s deficient for a per-

son’s needs and they’re dissatis-
fied with being Jewish, I’m not
sure that it’s wrong with becom-
ing Christian, but I question why.
There is also a great fear of evan-
gelism, because evangelism has
brought a pole of destruction to the
Far East and Africa, through the
Catholic Church. But I don’t feel
that the Jews for Jesus movement
is going to convert every Jew on
the earth.”

"Jewish adults are scared that
their children won't keep their be-
lief. which is one reason that
some Jewish people are upset by
the Jews for Jesus movement."
said Rabbi Phillip Siegel. Dir-
ector of the B’nai B‘rith Hillel
Jewish University Center. “Even
the results of Key '73 (a national
evangelical movement toward
Christ), are negligible among
Jewish students—of the 5.000 Jew-
ish students on Pitt‘s campus. I
have heard rumor of only 2 or 3
Jewish students that believe in
Jesus. As a matter of fact. Jews
are way ahead in counseling
Christians."

Siegel noted that although the
Jews for Jesus movement quoted
a figure of about 7.000 Jews to
Christ each year, at least 5.000
Christians are converting to Jud-
aism per year.

“Actually, this movement to
Christ is just a superficial kind
of thing. The average University
student wants a religion that has
more to offer than the non-struc-
tured Jesus movement does.

"In this age.” said Siegel.
“when so many people have drop-
ped Christology. it is surprising
that Jewish people are afraid of
the Jews for Jesus movement. The
Jews for Jesus group is only a
fringe group, and fringe groups
are always insecure."

in at the Drake Relays in Des
Moines. Ia.. earlier in the cam-
paign.

To date, Rea has jumped 26
feet four inches, which ' at one
time in the season was the fourth’
best long jump in the world. But
27 feet has been eclipsed out in
the West Coast and Rea will need
a colossal jump—close to his 26
feet 7'/2 inch feat a year'ago—to
come up with a first. His chances
in finishing in the top three or
four retaining his All-American
"credentials are better than good.

Rea will be coming-off a winin

But. Panther goalie, Bart Mack.
doesn’t think the team is as tough
as they appear to be. .
“Frank’s Lunch is the most ov-
errated team in ‘the league,”

--Mack said. .“They’re nothing but

a bunch of rink rats. If we have
Kerry Browne, Duke Schaeffer,
John Finney, and Joe Testa (the
four Panther defensemen) they’ll
have more trouble than they bar-

The Panthers currently have a

..5-2 record. A‘win against Franks

Lunch would be a big help in
their quest for the league title.
But Franks Lunch isn’t about to
ruin their undefeated record
without a vicious fight. The Pan-
thers will. therefore; need more
than just a full squad for this
game. Every member of the Pan-
ther team will have’ to give his
best effort. "

Ron Siegel leads all 'Panther

The game between Frank’s

.Gordie_Howe took the role of a

proud father/Tuesday as his sons,
Mark and Marty, signed four-year V
contracts with the Houston Aeros
of the World Hockey Association.

But Howe, currently a vice.

president with the Detroit Red
Wings of the NHL, may not be
far behind his sons in signing a
multi-year agreement with the
fledgling league. "

“Thank you. for sharing in the
proudest moment of Houston Aero
history,” Aero president Jim Smith
said in announcing the contracts.
‘.'Gordie’s main concern today

a was forhis son.

"We’re. continuing to negotiate
with Gordie and we hope to have

another announcement in the near .

future."

Howe. 45. retired from the Red
Wings as a/player-two years ago.
One of his few unfulfilled goals
in the National Hockey League
was to play on the same ‘team
with his sons;

"Jim Smith andll are in the
same ballpark." the elder Howe
said of his own negotiations with
the Aeros. ' ‘

"Again. it is just a matter of
one word-money. All the cards
are on the table. The figures
that were put out on the table
won't change. its just a matter
of coming to terms." ~

Smith said the contract talks I

with Howe involve having him
play for a certain length of

time. then join the Aero front,

office. _

LAS VEGAS. Nev.—Player free-
dom. artificial turf and collective
bargaining are some of the issues
being tackled by the National
Football League Players Associa-
tion during four days of. meet-
ings here.

Ed Garvey. executive director
of the NFLPA. said Tuesday the
meetings were aimed at attracting
attention to "the" player's rights by
having most of the players come
and discuss their points and griev-
ances so that some solutions can
be attained."

"Where before -it was usually
thought that John Mackey and
I controlled the players‘ nego-
tiations. now we have better
communication and a more one-
and-one relationship between
the players where things can be
discussed." Garvey said at a news

conference with Mackey. San’

Diego Chargers tight end and
president of the NFLPA.

Mackey said players attending
the convention hoped to outlaw

the NFL’s reserve clause and

rules limiting a player to be
playing for one specific team.

"It’s incredible that the play-
ers are the only ones in society
who do not have their freedom."
he said. "The major concern is
that when the player gets drafted

he is obliged to play for that
team only orelse doesn‘t play .
football at all."

Garvey said the players were
asking NFL owners to await a
ruling from the safety commis-
sion setting standards for. artifi-
cial turf. Both Garvey and Mack-
ey said most players /preferred
playing on natural turf but added
a new type of artificial turf just
introduced may be softer than
grass. -

‘_‘But all were’re asking now
for the time being is that the own-
ers stop - installing artificial sur-
faces until some safety standards
can be set,” Garvey said.

with the requisite L high-speed

 wits between "good and evil. The
‘problem is that this battle is
about as exciting as watching two
well-programmed computers
playing chess. except that the
characters have even less per-
sonality.
 As “the Jackal” of the title, Ed-
ward Fox is certainly more pleas-
ing to the eye than a Hal (Ku-
brick’s 2001 computer), but is
more of a murder-machine than
an assassin, -given all the conno-

mounting risks of discovery.

kind of thrills that could keep an
audience at the edge of its seats
for this two hour-plus movie. As
it is. Jackal is a rather tedious.
impersonal. almost routine crime
yarn. like watching two straight
hours of Jack Webb and Co.

1 Many viewers will enjoy Jack-
al. It has an ingenious plot de-
tailing the careful planning of a
professional killer. Of course, fic-
tionalizing about a well-known fig-
ure (Charles de Gaulle) will cer-
tainly generate more interest
than a purely fictional story, but
it does make the ending rather
obvious.

For viewers who are ready for
a few laughs amidst this serious
cinema. the Warner Theatre is
now showing Hitler: The Last Ten
Days. As the title succinctly says.
the film covers the last ten" days
in Hitler’s life.

The Last Ten Days is highly
reminiscent of—'and in a way. a
sequel to—Charlie Chaplin‘s pre-
W_W II satire The Great Dictator.

Distinguished British actor Sir
Alec ‘Guinness even resembles
Chaplin‘s characterization of the
title role and often lapses into his
native accent from Hitler‘s Ger-
man one.

‘The laughs abound from the
scene where Eva Braun sings
“Toot, Toot Tootsie, Good-bye”
while starving Berliners flee the
ravished city, to the discussion
of how each character will kill
himself (the cook staunchly
claims she will stand at her post
and gas herself as the Russians
draw near, then someone reminds
her she has an all-electric kitch-
ens).

Guinness transforms Hitler
from the much-maligned tryant
of history to a lovable buffon who
throws tantrum after tantrum as
his generals scramble to‘ save the
remains of the Fatherland.

One tends to wonder if the blitz-
kriegs of Czechoslovakia, Poland.

et al. were nearly as much fun. If .

this was the kind of Hitler who led
the Nazis, it must have been
Groucho Marx, not Karl, who for-
mulated Communism.

The plot seems to have been in-
spired by The Producers, a spoof
which had two con men dig up
the worst Broadway play they
could find-«Springtime for Hitler.
Maybe the two should have used
The Last Ten Days to carry out
their scheme. «
