Family House nixes   marathon

Charity Forced to cancel
clcrnce due to lack of interest

By Christopher Lawrence
Senior Staﬁ Writer

A dance marathon is a contest in which dancers must keep moving
and must dance on their own power at all times. The last one dancing
wins.

Such a contest, a “dance marathon centered around a dance
marathon,” existed recently around two groups at Pitt. One group
“stopped dancing,” and the other group won. What a difference a year

theplrilanthropy, Family House received a $113,000 donation, funds
which were raised through the Greeks’ armual dance marathon.

As of last month, there were two dance marathons scheduled for the
weekend of March 22 — the Greek Week Dance Marathon and the
University of Pittsburgh Family House Dance Marathon.

Now, as that weekend approaches, only the Greek marathon remains.

“We were not able to secure enough dancers to make it happen,”
Special Events Coordinator for Family House Maureen Anderson said.

The cancellation of Family House’s dance marathon is the result of
many things, Anderson said, including the “mood of the campus” and
the other events scheduled for the weekend, such as the Hand-in-Hand
Festival.

Family House’s idea of holding a university-wide dance marathon
stemmed from a similar event at Penn State.

Pitt students find their ham

By James Ruﬁin
For The Pitt News

The Internet started in 1969 as an idea
scribbled on the back of an envelope by a
man named Vmtcerf. He wanted to electroni-
cally link large computers at different univer-
sities so the computers could share informa-
tion without having to manually transfer elec-
tronic tape or punch cards.

In the 1970s the<U.S. rrrilitary-developed
the Internet as a way for it to communicate in
case of a nuclear war.

In 1989, Tim Bemes-Lee of CERN, an
institute in Geneva, Switzerland, created a
language called HTML. HTML, or hypertext
mark—up language, allows people to share
documents, pictures, video and
sound over the Intemet.

By 1994, programs such as Mosaic and
Netscape helped the Intemet become popular
by allowing people to navigate the Internet,
via the World Wide Web, by just pointing
and clicking.

At the University of Pittsburgh in 1995, the ’

Intemet is a common sight in computer labs.
Almost every Pitt student has some experi-
ence with it — either anxiously watching
someone click through Web pages when you
need a computer to ﬁnish your ﬁnal paper
that’s due tomorrow, or sneaking a peek at
your favorite pages when you know you
should be working on something else.

Yet, have you ever wondered how those
pages get on the Web and who puts them
there? It may be the person sitting next to you
in the lab. There are a number of Pitt students
who have their own page and create Web
pages for the university.

Sandeep Prasad, a 20-year-old junior

majoring in electrical engineering here at Pitt,

is one such student. He started his page
called “The Deep End” last fall.

“The Deep End” consists of Prasad’s com-
ments at the top of the page and over a hun-
dred links to other pages. He said it started
out as his personal page with links to give
him easier access to sports pages, so he could
keep track of his favorite teams and athletes.
Then his friends started using his page, and

e on the Web

asked him to add their favorite links to other
pages.

“It was a personal page,” Prasad said,
“now it’s a page for everyone.”

Other people heard about his page through
word of mouth, and soon people were e-
mailing him and asking trim to add links to
his page. Now “The Deep End” is a fairly
popular page, averaging 38 visitors per day.
During September, for instance, he had 2,661
visitors, and he has had 9,661 since he started
the page. Prasad said his page even got
noticed by PC Magazine, which asked him if
they could write about his page. But he
turned them down.

Potential Problems

Prasad said that he feels communication
with the people who visit his page is impor-
tant, but this can lead to problems. One time
he wrote that he thought O.J. Simpson would
get acquitted by the jury and asked for people
to e-mail him with responses. He received 78

TEL AVIV — Making clos-
ing arguments in the trial of
the confessed assassin of
Yitzhak Rabin, defense
lawyers tried to save their
client from a murder convic-
tion, arguing to a skeptical
bench that he had meant only
to disable Mr. Rabin, and that
a second gunman might have
fired the fatal shots.

Yigal Amir, a 25-year-old

Orthodox Jew, has admitted-

in court to shooting Mr. Rabin
on Nov. 4, arguing that he
was following Jewish law to
prevent the mortal danger of
handing over land to the
Palestinians. The assassin was
videotaped by an onlooker,
whose pictures showing Amir
firing were shown to the
three-judge tribunal hearing
the case. The tribunal will
issue the verdict at a date to
be announced. The New York

BONN — For the second
time this month, Kurdish pro-
testors demanding a separate

deported.

Kurdish demonstrators,

barred by a court ruling from
holding a rally in Dortmund
to celebrate the Kurdish New
Year, blocked major highways
for hours on Saturday and
encircled two German police
officers, beating and kicking
them before stealing their ser-
vice weapons. The New York

TAIPEI, Taiwan — At the
outset of a climactic week of
military and political struggle
over Taiwan’s future, China
warned the United States to

Prime Minister Li Peng,
speaking in Beijing at the
conclusion of annual session
of the National People’s

said, “If someone makes a

MOSCOW — Carefully
sidestepping his party’s most

WASHINGTON —- The
Justice Department, which
began investigating the tobac-
co industry three years ago,
has in recent months expand-
ed the criminal and civil
inquiries, making them the
Clinton administration’s most
aggressive prosecutorial effort
against the makers of a single
consumer product, govern-
ment and private lawyers fol-
lowing the issue say.

At the leading edge of the
Justice Department’s actions,
which could end in giving
tobacco executives jail terms,
are separate grand jury
inquiries by federal prosecu-
tors in Manhattan, Brooklyn,
the District of Columbia,
Alexandria, Va. and New

WASHINGTON — Even as

President Clinton and con-
gressional Republicans race
to take credit for shrinking the
federal payroll, the govern-

No one argues that the two
sets of data are directly corre-
lated, but critics of federal
contracting policies contend
that pronouncements crediting
the shrinking federal work
force with bringing big sav-
ings to taxpayers are overstat-
ed. And they say thereare
other disadvantages that can-
not be measured monetarily.

e-mail messages that day, which
took up all the space in his
UNIX account.

If “The Deep End” receives
too many visitors, it could cause
Pitt’s servers (large computers
that link all of Pitt’s computers to
the Internet) to break down. and
Pitt’s computing service would
kick “The Deep End” off the
Internet. That’s why he turned
down PC Magazine.

Prasad said that one time his
friend threatened to put a link to
‘The Deep End” on a pomogra-
phy page that receives about
5,000’visitors a day if Prasad
didn’t do what he said. Prasad
said even if a fraction of those
visitors looked at “The Deep
End,” Pitt’s servers would crash.

Prasad became interested in
creating pages when he found he
could keep track of statistics for
his fantasy football league by
making his own page with links
to sports pages. He learned how
to make Web pages from one of
his friends, who learned how to
create pages in his Electronic
Media class at Pitt.

Getting Started on the
Web

You may think that program-
ming Web pages is only for com-
puter nerds, but the Electronic
Media class is a non-fiction
English writing class. It’s taught
by Bruce Dobler, an English pro-
fessor and head of computing in
the English department.

He first became interested in
the Internet when Harry
Bloomberg, who also teaches the
Electronic Media class with
Dobler, showed him a photojour-

’ nalism article on the ‘Net. The

author had gone from Boston to
Alaska and published the’ artigle
on his own on the Web. Dobler
said the author was doing what
he was teaching in his journalism
classes, and he wanted know
more about it.

Dobler and Bloomberg created
the Electronic Media class last
year-when they plarmed to do a

two-hour seminar class on the
Internet. One of Dobler’s other
classes was canceled, so they
made it a full semester course.
Students in the class learn how
to use UNIX and HTML, which
are the operating system and
computer language, respectively,
that allow them to make Web
pages. They also learn how to
lay out the page and add sound,
images and video clips. Students
take up internships or projects.
These.usually involve creating
pages for one of Pitt’s depart-
ments. '
In Dobler’s class, Prasad
worked on a project for Pitt’s
Computing and Information
Service. He developed a page
that would allow computer lab
assistants to search for computer
manuals. If a student or lab assis-
tant needs a manual, the page
will tell them where it is and
how to get it. ’
Karen Kranack, a 22-year-old
senior majoring in English litera-
ture who was another student in
the Electronic Media class,

worked on improving the

English department’s Web page,
and created a Web page for the

_ English club.

Kranack said she wanted the
English c1ub’s page to be a
resource for undergraduate
English majors. She wanted to
have articles on what it means to
be an English major at Pitt and to
let people know what’s good and
bad about the major. She also
wanted people to be able to write
in and talkabout their_experi-
ences as an English major.

The page also has links to Web
pages on famous authors, links
on writing,’and links to places
where students can submit their
work and get published.

Dobler’s Electronic Media
class is one way to get on the

Web, but it’s not the only way.‘

Dobler said that any Pitt student
with a computer account can
potentially have their own page.

ment, such as a “Beginner’s
Guide to HTML.”
This may sound very difficult,

but both Kranack and Prasad '

said HTML was not very hard to
learn.

“HTML was pretty easy to
learn,” Kranack said..“It was like
Word Perfect. You use different

‘ commands to turn things on and
‘ off.” ‘ 9’

Prasad said if you wantto cre-
ate a page, you ﬁgure out what

I’   . ‘ you wanton it and how you want
»  it to.look. Then you learn the
-F — commands, which get used

‘repeatedly. But even if you learn

how, why would you want to

“The Internet allows people to
be creative in a way they haven’t

* been able to,” Kranack said.

“People want something like this
as an outlet which allows them to

express who they are.”

Adam Lavelle, a senior at Pitt
and a student in Dobler’s
Electronic Media class, has done
some freelance work developing
commercial Web sites. Now he’s
helping to develop a Web page
for Craft Village, an on-line cata-
log for buying and selling crafts.

He said the total project costs-

about $4,000 and he will get paid
between $1,000 to $1,500 when
the project is done.

Dobler pointed out that pub-

added that Marbles is seen by‘

people allover the world, while
university magazines such as

Dobler said he believes the
Web is creating a real revolution,
and it will change our future. He

says it will change the way-we

do research, and it will change
entertainment, business, govem-
ment, communication, advertis-
ing, banking and the media. One
day we may be turning on our

“It’s as big of a revolution as

university, particularly the

Student and Public Affairs Leon
Haley. “That was the start of the
University of Pittsburgh/Farnily
House Dance Marathon.”

Family House then put together
a team of students who would be
responsible for the production of
the event . ~ .

The fact that the Family House

Dance Marathon became certi-

ﬁ_cd as a registered student orga-

nization gave it access to univer-

sity funds. Pitt donated the use-of
Fitzgerald Field House to this
organization, a fact that
rubbed some people the wrong
way.

executive board director of the
Pitt Program Council and enter-
tainment co—chair for the Family
House Dance Marathon, the PPC
has tried a number of times to
reserve the Field House for con-
certs and has met with little suc-
cess. —
“I think it’s unfortimate that the
Athletics Department would
cooperate with them and not with
a.student organization that does
most of the programming for the
campus,” Hughes said.

Family House is connected
with the university as an indepen-
dent charity organization, said
Teny Milani, associate director of
Student Activities, and the

Family House Dance Marathon -

organization represents student
participation in the fundraising
endeavor.

‘The students are ‘involved in 1
leading and managing that activi- ’

ty,” Milani said.

According to Hughes, howev-
er, there were problems in the
way this was done.

“When you hold a position
with the Office of Student
Activities, you’re given authority
with your title,” Hughes said. ‘‘I
feel that Family House gives titles
to everyone, but they don’t give
any authority. They mean well,
but I don’t think they realize that
the OSA lets the students runs
things the way we want to run
them.” “

Hughes feels that Family
House’s marathon was modeled
too closely on Penn State’s to be
successful.

“So many things differ
between our two campuses, and

, this needs to be taken into

account,” Hughes said. “You
can’t treat Pitt students like Penn
State students. They don’t have
the same tastes.”

These “diﬁ°ering tastes” may be
one of the reasons for the event’s
cancellation.

The Family House Dance
Marathon was meant to be a
fundraiser targeted at the students,
Anderson said, but the reaction
on the Pitt campus was apathetic.

“A lot of students weren’t inter-
ested or looked for what was in it
for them,” Anderson said.

Despite the fact that the num-
ber of students who signed up
was below Family House’s
expectations, Anderson says that
the organization would still like to
try to do something on the Pitt
campus.

“We don’t giveup,” Anderson
said.

as criminals, whether they are 15 or 65. And it’s about time.

Under a newlaw that went into effect yesterday, anyone at
least l5years old who-is charged with a felony (rape, armed rob-
bery; aggrav"atedassault,etc.) will be triedas an adult in criminal
court.’    f-V .« ‘ .

/Until now, only teens accused of committing’ murder could be
tried as adults. ‘Andone of the biggest problems with allowing
violent criminals to be judged in juvenile court is that, if convict-
ed, a. juvenile can only be detained until he or she is 21 years
old. Many juvenile sentences are less than five years.

Also, if someone is tried as a juvenile for a crime, once the
sentence has been fulfilled, the juvenile court record is sealed.
No criminal record gets stapled to future job applications, even if
the person had committed rape.

So until now, juvenile felons basically had an open invitation
to do anything they wanted, commit any crime they wanted, with
very few repercussions. Many juveniles will tell you that they
knew they had nothing to fear except a few years at a detention
center, so why not? It’s almost like getting a free reign of terror.

Even if those juveniles hadn’t taken that into consideration,
juvenile sentences are only a fraction of what the same crime
committed by an adult would carry.

The major argument against this new law is that juveniles will
only be guaranteed an arraignment within 72 hours — adults are
guaranteed one within 48. However, juveniles in Allegheny
County will be held at Shuman and treated as juveniles until
their arraignments, where they will have a public defender to
argue their cases. In juvenile court, there is no public defender.
Juveniles who fall under this rule will also have the opportunity
to post bail, since they are being tried as adults. I

And this issue reaches close to home. You may remember that
a Pitt student, Kevin Cecil, was shot in the neck last summer, the
bullet leaving him a quadriplegic for the rest of his life.

The accused gunman and one of his accomplices were of the
same age as a ninth grader. But Cecil will never regain the use of
his legs. The ages of his attackers are completely irrelevant.
They are old enough to know that it’s illegal to shoot someone.
They are old enough to face the consequences of their actions.

A New York judge perfectly summed up the problem of juve-
nile sentencing: “It doesn’t matter if your killer is 15 or 50,
you’re still dead.” It doesn’t hurt any less to be attacked by a 16-
year-old, and the terror doesn’t go away faster if the person who
raped you was only 15. Every violent crime has a victim who
couldn’t care less how old the attacker was. And if you are old
enough to commit violent crime, you are old enough to face the
judicial system as an adult.

From Pittsburgh to fortune

My former girlfriend occa-
sionally teases me about not
forgetting her when I become a
famous writer. Of course I tell
her I won’t.

I recall those conversations
because I do know someone
who has recently “made it” -
another black guy named Rick
from right here in Pittsburgh.

But he wasn’t someone
whom I would have expected to
do so.

About eight or nine years
ago, when I lived over on
Melwood Avenue, I walked
past the music building and
spotted this sign: “Jam Session
on Friday, 3-5 p.m.” So the next
Friday afternoon I was free (I
worked at the Giant Eagle in
East Liberty at the time so I
didn’t have a set schedule), I
took my tenor saxophone to the
music building to see what was
what.

As it turned out, the session
took place in one of the
rehearsal rooms (which I had
been to many times before,
since I had taken Jazz
Improvisation twice with Dr.
Nathan Davis) and was being
run by two guitarists. One was
Dan Shields, a guitar major at
Pitt and a Russ Freeman look-
and sound-alike who would
later do graduate work at
Duquesne. He did things on his
black—and-rainbow-streaked
Fender Telecaster I had never
seen before (don’t ask me what
they were —— I can’t remem-
ber). I remember being
impressedwith his playing; it
seemed that during his solos he
never hit a single wrong note,
no matter how fast or intensely
he played.

The other was Rick, whose
axe of choice was an almond-
colored Gibson Les Paul. He
was short and squat, wore his
hair in a Jheri curl, which was
popular in that day, and had an
infectious smile; you felt good
around him. He too played well
and knew music, but he wasn’t
in the same class as Dan. (But
then again, no one was.)

 

Rick
N owlm

Anyway, I started going to
the sessions regularly, and the
three of us were joined by any
number of musicians in the
course of a given Friday after-
noon. Usually .there was a
bassist, a drummer and about
two or three others, guitarists or
horn players. We didn’t do any
particular style of music --
some rock, some jazz (main-
stream and fusion) and even
some blues. I taught the other
guys Herbie Hancock’s
“Maiden Voyage” and Steely
Dan’s “Pretzel Logic,” and one
time Dan came in with a beauti-
ful bluesy riff which I later
wrote lyrics to. Once we even
worked up a tune, right there on
the spot, that I called “Fighting
the Fire.” Occasionally I picked
up my ﬂute on a slower tune,
and I even sat down at the
piano (which I don’t play so
well anymore), as we usually
didn’t have a keyboard player.

But it seems that all good
things have to come to an end,
and the Friday jam sessions did
so after a few’ months.
However, I did see Rick in the
store from time to time when I
was working — apparently he
lived in the East Liberty area —
and he told me about a new
band he had just hooked up
with in which he was playing
bass. He told me its name,
which was quite unusual, but I
don’t remember if he ever
asked me to come see the band

perform. Whatever, I never did P

go, as I prefer jazz and I’ve
never been much of a lounge
lizard anyway. Besides that, I
knew that musicians often went

from project to project and
wasn’t sure how long it would
last.

Boy, do I regret it now.

Before long, Rick and his
cohorts were making quite a
splash in the local music scene,
to the point of even selling out
gigs; a friend of mine in
Morgantown, W. Va., told me
that her 'then—boyfriend was a
big fan. And over the years, the
band became bigger and bigger;
once when I saw it being men-
tioned in In Pittsburgh, I
thought to myself, ‘‘All right,
Rick!” Then came national
tours, when he was gone for
months at a time.

And then the bombshell. The
last time I ran into Rick at the
store (by this time I was no
longer working there), he
informed me that he and the

group were about to ﬂy to Los ’

Angeles to do some recording;
they had been signed by
Mercury Records. “Man,
you’ve really hit the big time
now,” I thought. And that’s not
what I would have expected. I
mean, we both played with this
absolutely killer guitarist whom
I would suspected was destined
for greatness. (And it’s not that
Dan’s hurting for work —— he
plays with three bands in the
area, the worship band at his
church and some contemporary
Christian acts when they tour.)

But now that Rick performs
with a nationally known act, I
have to wonder: Did any of my
musical influence rub off on
him during those jam sessions
we had at Pitt so many years
ago? Or might he invite me to
sit in with the band at some
point? Nah, that may just be my
ego talking. But it gives’ me
some satisfaction to know that
someone I actually played with
has made it big.

Rick’s real name, I learned
later, is Patrick Norman.

And his band? Rusted Root.

Voicing their opinions...

Some sex
marriages

I am writing in response to
the opinion which ran in the
Jan. 30 issue of The Pitt News,
submitted by S. Taylor.
According to Taylor, homosex-
uality goes against the

Christian God’s holy inten-

tions, exemplified by the story
of Genesis, in which God is
said to have created a man and
a woman to be partners, as
opposed to two women or two
men. Thus, states Taylor, “This
would seem to be the natural,
perhaps even divine, ordination
of sexuality in the scheme of
things.” To refute Taylor’s
argument on the same terms,
those of Christianity, I find that
I must issue a reminder: when
Adam and Eve were created,

‘they were the only ones on the

whole planet. Their relation-

ship and those of the following
generations had to be hetero-
sexual, in order to populate this
newly made world.

Millennia later, however, we
are. faced with overpopulation
and starvation from all corners
of this once nearly uninhabited
planet. Would it not seem rea-
sonable that God, realizing that
we have begun reproducing at
a rate which this planet cannot
tolerate, simply issued his own
solution for the overpopula-
tion? To put people together
who could not easily repro-
duce? I am a practicing
Christian, yet I do not believe
that I worship the same God as
Taylor. I cannot conceive that
the God I love, which I have
been brought up to worship,
would consider any of the gays
or lesbians with whom I am
acquainted either unnatural or
evil. Beyond all else, this argu-
ment cannot possibly be used
as a reason why the state may

forbid homosexual marriage:
the Constitution clearly man-
dates that there will be a sepa-
ration of church and state.
Taylor also says that a het-
erosexual couple can provide a
better means of raising children
than a homosexual couple can.
I would argue that in a hetero-
sexual union, it is far easier to
have unwanted children.
Homosexual couples must
work very hard to be allowed
to adopt children; it is beyond
likely that they do not want
these children for whom they
fought so hard. Nor is it possi-
ble for homosexuals to keep
having children solely for the
welfare benefits that come with
them. The same cannot be said
of heterosexual couples. No,
the couple who will provide
the loving and nurturing envi-
ronment are those who had to
work to have their children and
who had to earn the right to
raise them. It is not heterosexu-

ality that brings about a healthy
community, as Taylor suggests,
but familial love and respect.
Such feelings are not restricted
to heterosexuals.

The last point of Taylor’s
argument is that homosexuality
goes against society’s norms.
At one point, society’s norms
also dictated that blacks were
not equal and that women
could not have the right to
vote. Just because society says
something does not mean that
it is true. Judge not, lest ye be
judged.

a student at the university, we
decided to call and confirm
that he could still volunteer.
The response to our question
was that Pitt students were pre-
ferred as volunteers, and my
boyfriend was not allowed to
participate. I strongly disagree
with this policy.

With three years of experi-
ence as a Special Olympics
volunteer, including two years
as a committee chairperson,
my boyfriend and I feel that he
is amply qualified. We
informed a representative of
Hand-In-Hand of his qualifica-
tions, but he was still denied
the opportunity to volunteer.
Regardless of his past.experi-
ence, Hand—In-Hand’s exclu-
sion of non-students as volun-
teers defeats the purpose of
community service.
Volunteering should be open to
all who wish to help others.
The benefits of allowing non-
students to volunteer are
numerous. First, it allows the
outside community to witness
first hand the positive contribu-
tions of university students.
Second, with more volunteers,
the festival could expand and
offer more activities for those
in need. Finally, allowing non-
student help will expand the
notoriety of the festival into the
surrounding communities and
help it gain widespread recog-
nition.

Community service is an
integral part of a higher educa-
tion, and the Hand-In-Hand
festival provides a valuable,
worthwhile experience to stu-
dents. However, in denying
this experience to non-students,
Hand-In-Hand is sending the
wrong message about what
volunteerism should be. Hand-
In-Hand might find that new

' , ideas about the festival might

be offered if members of the
outside community were
allowed to participate. We feel
that there is no concrete reason
why students should be pre-
ferred over non-students.
Unless a valid reason exists,
we feel this policy has no merit
and should be changed so that
no one is excluded from being
a Hand-In-Hand volunteer.

It's time for
tournament

tidbits

 

i Columnis
Mike
Kovak

1th the NCAA tourna-

ment narrowed down

to the Sweet 16, the
computers have been proven
wrong once again.

First of all, the Southeastern
Conference (SEC), is an unbe-
lievable 8-0 in the tournament.
The computer ranking system,
known as the RPI, rates the
SEC ﬁfth amongst our nation’s
basketball conferences.

Kentucky has continued to
roll through its competition. Of
course, the RPI has Kentucky
ranked No. 1, so we’ll give

. them a little credit.

But what about the other SEC
squads?
SEC tournament champ,

Mississippi State, has bolted its 9 ’

way to the Sweet 16, as have
Arkansas and Georgia

The Arkansas team does the
most to disprove any computer
rankings. Not in the top 40, the
Razorbacks have “upset
tougher” opponents, like the Big
Ten phenom Penn State and
Conference USA stalwart
Marquette.

Let’s not forget that Arkansas
is playing without leading scor-
er Jesse Pate and leading
rebounder Sunday Adebayo.
For the fourth consecutive sea-
son, Head Coach Nolan
Richardson has led his team to
the Sweet 16, with this unques-
tionably his best coaching job.

Georgia beat another Big Ten

powerhouse, Purdue, who can

now hold claim as the worst No.
1 seed ever. Georgia, with five
seniors in the starting lineup, is
once again looking like the team
that manhandled Pitt earlier in
the season. .

By the way, unless you didn’t
notice, the Big Ten sucks. No
teams left, they ﬁnished third in
the RPI’s. Oh yeah, I almost for-
got, Penn State was a top 20
RPI team.

The Big East, ranked sixth by
the RPI, has shined brighter
than the black eyes on Frank

’ Bnmo. Connecticut looks

tough, and Georgetown looks
like the best team in the country.
The Hoyas will make the Final
Four, and they just might beat
the Kentucky Wildcats, too.
The biggest “shock” for the
Big East came when the
Villanova Wildcats lost to the
Louisville Cardinals on Sunday.

Track runs

Fletcher

dominance

The Pitt men’s and

women’s track teams trav-
elled to Kingston, Jamaica to
begin the 1996 outdoor sea-
son at the prestigious Jamaica
Relays. That, in itself, is
quite an accomplishment.

The meet serves as a tune-
up for the Jamaican national
championship meet as well as
the Central American and
Caribbean Association cham-
pionships. Pitt was one of
only eight schools" in the
United States invited to the
meet.

The outdoor season picked
up right where the indoor
season left off. 1 S

For Najuma Fletcher, that
meant remaining in the famil-
iar position at the top of the
high jump standings. Fletcher
won the event with a jump of
6-1 1/4, qualifying her for the
national championship meet.
Fletcher also placed fifth in
the javelin with lll-10.

Fletcher’s throw was
topped by Trecia Smith, who
was third in the javelin with
127-3. Smith put together an
impressive day in front of her
hometown crowd in the
throwing events. In addition
to her performance in the
javelin, Smith was seventh in
the discus with 117-10 and
first among collegiate .com-

petitors in the, shotput. with

Pitt trackster Orrel Green was part of the Panther 4x400 relay team that took fifth place at
the Jamaica Relays over the weekend. Pitt was one of eight American schools invited.

45-1 1/4.
. "“She’di"d as good as any
athlete could under the cir-
cumstances. She had a great
_ meet. I didn’t see her limp or
hobble atall,” Head Coach
Steve Lewis said. 1
Smith injured her ankle
over the weekend and did not
practice on Monday. .
For the men, Ron
Losiewicz looks ready to
help improve the men-’-s field

 

event squad. For his first step
back from injuries that have
haunted him since last out-
door season, Losiewicz took
first place in the shot put
with a throw of 46-10 1/4..

“He’s not close to my
expectations for him. This
was a good opportunity for
him to get started and
warmed up,” Lewis said.

On the track, the women

;had several successful events.

In the 800 meters, Natasha
Van Reil finished fifth with
2:20.16. Angie Martin wasn’t
near her best time in the
event, but her 2:11.24 was
still good enough for second
place.

“Angie did a good job with
the competition that was
there,” Lewis said.

top five in the women’s 400- .

The Pitt lacrosse team
steamrolled yet another
opponent, beating Slippery
Rock 10-2 last Thursday at
the Cost Center. They have
outscored opponents this
— . year 40-6 en route to a 3-0
record.

In previous games, Head
Coach Gary Neff said the

 the game progresses Against
Slippery Rock, Pitt netted
four goals in the first min-
utes of the game. Rock
didn’t score until the fourth
quarter, after the score was

the Panthers circled them-
selves around the goal and
passed around the horn.

Then Pitt used a play that
has worked in previous
games. The two men facing
the goal pick down towards
the goal and the man in front
curls out and receives a pass
from behind the net, leaving
an open ‘ shot. Rory
Connaughton was the man
this time and scored on a
quick low shot.

“When we call plays on
offense we try to give them
a different look every time.
We try to make the defense
switch up as much as possi-
ble. We’ve put in a lot of
plays and I don’t think many
teams can defend that
many,” said Neff.

After the ensuing face-off,
Pitt gained possession and
Pete Choi made a pass from
the front of the goal to Love,
who was on the right side.
He faked a shot and then
went around the defender

This year sophomore George
“Andy” Anderson earned a berth on
Pitt’s diving team. Last year a letter
from Pitt ended his 13-year gymnas-
tic career and Anderson’s way of life
came to an end. The letter said Pitt’s
gymnastics team no longer existed.

Last month at the Big East
Swimming and Diving
Championship, Anderson helped the
Panthers finish second in the men’s
team competition.

“I still can’t believe I got 10th place
in the three meter,” Anderson said. “I

was happy to be on a team whether

' we won or lost.”

At the Big East Championships,
Anderson came just a few degrees
short of a perfect rip — a straight
diving entry that makes no waves.
The judges awarded him sevens on
dives he had learned just six months
earlier. 8

“I never thought I’d be doing a
reverse two-and-a-half,” Anderson
said. “There is a plateau that you hit
with certain dives, just the fact you
are doing them is a huge step.”

While practicing diving in October,
he sometimes hit the water ﬂat on his
back.

“I was getting pretty good at
smacking. I’d come home with little
welts on my back,” Anderson said.
“But it was worth it. I didn’t think I’d
be competing.”

It was at a November meet at Penn
State that Anderson decided he
belonged.

“I got a back two-and-a-half. I got
sevens,” Anderson remembers. “That
was the turning point. I beat out one
of their divers that was a real diver.”

Anderson doesn’t consider himself

‘a “real diver” because his time in div-

ing doesn’t even register against his
years in gymnastics.

It is the gymnastics, however, that
make him such a
strong diver. His

gives Anderson another opportunity

The diving coach, Julian Krug, was
aware of Anderson’s situation as a
scholarship-supported athlete with no
team. Krug also understood the paral-
lels between the two sports. So when
Anderson tried out for diving, he
received a lot of encouragement. His
future team members, senior Jeremy
McClean and junior John Soulakis,
also urged him to stay with the new
sport despite its many frustrations.

Aspects of diving, such as locating
the pool’s position as he twisted
upside down in the air, were perilous-
ly different.

“It’s really frustrating. You want to
get closer to the board,” Anderson
explained. “In gymnastics you don’t
want to be near the equipment. It
takes so much guts [because you feel]
like you are trying to hit the end of
the board.” ,

Yet it is fear that makes divers have
accidents. Learning to dive, Anderson
knew he had to trust Krug and relax.
Learning to dive was about trust.

“Jeremy and John told me Julian
would teach me so much, and he

had a good day in the 1500 meters as
well. Rich Walsh ran the race in
4:02.00 to finish in sixth place. Ed
Adamson took fourth with his tim
of 3:56.83. »

The distance team has improved in
general since the beginning of the
indoor season, and Lewis expects
the distance runners in particular to
benefit from differences between
indoor and outdoor events. “Outdoor
season is different. We run the 1500
meters [just under a mile] instead of
the mile. We do. the steeple and the
400 hurdles,” Lewis said. “The
events are more conducive to the
type of team we have.” ’

teams don’t get to stay home for
long. This weekend they head back
down south for the Alabama Relays.

did,” Anderson said.

“I threw all the technique I knew out
the window and had him teach me
from scratch,” Anderson said.

This behavior was new for
Anderson. He had ﬂirted with diving
at Liverpool High School because a lot
of his friends were on the team.

“I didn't really like to be coached,”
confessed Anderson. “I just figured
my way was right because I had been
in gymnastics for so long.” .

He trusts Krug to turn him into a top
diver in next three years and hopefully
end his college career with a trip to the
NCAA Championships.

Since Anderson was recruited for
gymnastics, he has four years of eligi-
bility in diving. This parallels the
amount of time it will take him to
complete an engineering degree.

It was the engineering program that
brought him to Pitt and made him stay
once his gymnastics career was
brought to a halt.

“There is no point in transferring,”
Anderson thought last summer. “The
engineering program is more impor-
tant than gymnastics. It was my life,
but it wasn't going to get me anywhere
other than school.”

Now the diving schedule fits even‘

better into his academic: schedule. An

engineering degree takes five years, ’

but athletes can only compete in col-

legesports for four. The switch to a ’
new sport has brought Anderson one.

more year of eligibility.

“I’ll have five years of varsity Rath-

letics in college,” Anderson said. “I
had to be doing something or I’d go
crazy. I love being in front of the
crowd.” I

But I guess the RPI does not

Tournament notes:

Hot to trot: Louisville’s
DeJuan Wheat has been sensa-
tional. He scored 33 against
Tulsa and had 17 second-half '
points in the upset over
Villanova. Georgetown’s Allen
Iverson has scored 31 and 25 in
his ﬁrst two games of the tour-
ney. Georgia Tech’s freshman
sensation Stephon Marbury
scored a career-high 29 points to
go along with a career-high ‘nine
assists against Boston College.

Best Matchups: Cincinnati vs.
Georgia Tech

This is the best game on paper
yet. Cincinnati has the inside
power of second-team All-
American Darmy Fortson. They

' also have a nice outside game to

complement. Tech is on ﬁre,
playing better than any team
this side of Kentucky or
Georgetown.

Georgia vs. Syracuse

The Orangemen’s John Wallace
has been the nation’s _most con-
sistent performer this year.
Georgia has a smart, street-
savvy team, with little tourney
experience.

Louisville vs. Wake Forest
Sumaki Walker is no joke, and
sickly Tim Duncan will find this
out soon enough. Both teams
have great inside games‘ and
streaky outside shooting,
although Wake’s Ricky Peral
was dynamite behind the are
this season.

goalie.

A few seconds later, Slippery
Rock was penalized again, giving
Pitt another man-up. Pitt set up in
the same formation as the previous
penalty, and after several passes
Mark Polecritti hit a cutting Rob
Heaps for a one-timer and a 3-0
lead.

The barrage of goals ended with a
pick play a minute later. Polecritti
picked a defender in front of the net
freeing Pat Shea to get a feed from
Dave Walter. Shea’s first shot was
blocked, but the ball sneaked into

the net on a Shea rebound, giving

Pitt its fourth goal in the opening

, three minutes of the match.

“I was really impressed with the
way we started the game,” said cap-
tain John Foris. “We usually start out

a little shaky, but we started strong
today. We shut them out except for a
few garbage goals at the end of the
game.”

To end the first quarter scoring,
Rob Heaps drilled one home on a
pass from Matt Haplemazian,
increasing the lead to 5-0.

At the beginning of the second
quarter, Pitt made one of its few mis-
takes of the game giving Rock a
wide-open try, but goalie Dave
Travis made a stick save on a point-
blank shot.

“Our goalie played great. He made
some fantastic saves,” said Foris.

For the next two-and-a-half quar-
ters, Pitt dominated both sides of the
field.

On one play, Travis was out of the
goal trying to make‘ an outlet pass,
but was intercepted by a Rock

attacker. He had an open net, but
defensemen Foris and Mike
Domboski planted themselves in
front of the net and blocked a
bounce shot.

The offense continued its scoring
with two goals by Choi and one each
by Haplamazian, Heaps and Walter.

“I think all around we have a bet-
ter team this year,” said Walter. “We
have a ton more depth than last year.
We can put in anyone and not lose
anything.”

“Last year we had a couple of
superstars on offense we went to
every time, but this year we have a
lot more balance on this team,” said
Foris. '

The team will try to keep their per-
fect record as they face Davis and
Elkins College tonight at 6:30 at the
Cost Center.
