Sarah Halperin’s-educational fu-
ture became more uncertain after

Gov. Tom Corbett announced his v

proposed budget cuts for Pitt ear-
lier this month. 7

“I’m not originally from; Penn-
sylvania, but my dad was a Pitt
alum, and I knew that I always
wanted to come here,” said Halp—

erin, a sophomore and Massachu-

setts native.

Halperin participated in the
letter—writing campaign hosted
by the Student Government Board
and the Staff Association Council

A in the Kurtzman Room of the Wil-

liam Pitt Union on Tuesday and
Wednesday. The campaign col-
lected 50 letters addressed to state
legislators, askingthem to oppose
the budget cuts. 4 .

“I wrote to Senator Wayne Fon-
tana because my parents and I are
not sure that I will be able to afford
the cost of out—of-state tuition, and
I may have to transfer in the fu-
ture,” Halperin said.

Pitt’s Governmental Relations

' partnered with the Pitt Alumni As-

sociation to provide participants
with informational packets outlin-
ing how to contact legislators and
background information regarding
the proposed state funding cuts at
the letter—writing event.

 

The Daily Student

On Feb. 7, Corbett announced

‘ his $27.4 billion state budget pro-

posal, which slashed spending and
suggested cutting Pitt’s state fund-
ing by 30 percent -— from $136
million to $95.2 million — for the
coming ﬁscal year. "H

Dean Kathy Humphrey interviewing forposition at Slippery Rock University

By Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Pitt Vice Provost and Dean of
Students Kathy Humphrey could
move less than an hour away for
a presidential position at another
Pennsylvania university.

’ Humphrey, who isin her sev-
enth year at Pitt, is currently in
the interview process for the posi— '
tion of president at Slippery Rock
University. 9 ' .

Karl Schwab, a spokesman for
SRU, said that Humphrey is one
of six candidates being consid-
ered for the position. The school

hopes to have the interview pro-
cess completed and the new presi-
dent chosen by late spring or early
summer.

Pitt’s Student Affairs spokes-
man Shawn Ahearn said in an email
that Humphrey remains “passion-
atelycommitted to Pitt” and that at
this early stage in SRU’s selection

process, further comment would A

be premature.

Schwab said SRU’s search for a
president is “a long and involved
process in order to ﬁnd the best-

qualiﬁed person.”

He said the search began with
an advertisement for-the open po-

sition in various news outlets and
a nationwide search by an outside
headhuntingcompany after Robert
Smith, who’s served as the presi-
dent of SRU for the past 10 years,
retired on Feb. 11. _ ‘
Schwab said that SRU’s presi-
dential search committee reviewed
all the applications and narrowed
the search down to six people.
The committee concluded the
last of the six interviews last Friday
and will now recommend the top
three candidates to the Council
of Trustees. If the council agrees

‘ with the three selections, it will

submit them to the chancellor of

the Pennsylvania State System of
Higher Education. . l

i This chancellor and members
of the Pennsylvania State System of
Higher EducationBoard of Gover-
nors will then meet with the three
candidates and ultimately choose
one. _

At Pitt, Humphrey oversees
many aspects of the University,
including the Office of Student
Life, Residence Life, the University
Counseling Center, Student Health
Services, the Universityjudicial Af-
fairs System, Career Services and
Disability Resources and Services,_

_among others. ’ A ,

“Anybody who knows Dr. Hum-
phrey knows that she loves Pitt,”
Ahearn said. “She is honored that
her accomplishments here led to
her nomination as a candidate for
the special opportunity to lead a
Pennsylvania public university.”

Humphrey also serves as the Of-
ﬁce of the Provost liaison to Pitt’s
four regional campuses and led the
initiative to create the Outside the
Classroom Curriculum in 2008.

Before coming to Pitt, she was
the vice president for student de-
velopment‘ at Saint Louis Univer-
sity for six years. I

  
   

     

ctiuists speak

Larry Gibson’s family has lived on Kayford
Mountain in West Virginia since the 1700s.

‘ He watched his family home go from being

the lowest point in town during the 1960s to
the highest today because of mountaintop
removal mining. ' ‘

“I’ve been shot at many times, my dogs -

got killed, a cabin got burned, drive by

shootings...” Gibson said about some of the '

responses elicited by his refusal to sell his
land to coal mining companies. “For me,
intimidation should have no place in this
movement at all.” _

Pitt’s Free the Planet hosted Gibson and
Amber Whittington, both speakers for the
Keeper of the Mountains foundation, a group
that aims to end mountaintop removal. The
two environmental activists ‘spoke on their
experiences living in the coal ﬁelds of West

Virginia for an hour and a half to a group of
about 40 students at Frick Fine Arts Building
Wednesday night. - '

Gibson said that mountaintop removal
coal mining in West Virginia negatively af-
fects the lives of thousands of state resi-
dents.‘ I

In the process of mountaintop removal
mining, coal companies use large amounts of
dynamite to remove the top of a mountain,
depositing the debris in the valley below and
exposing thousands of tons of coal.

Whittington said she originally had no

_ concept of coal’s impact on theeenvironment.

and that to her, getting electricity had always
seemed like simply “the ﬂicking of a switch.”
This changed when she moved to Raleigh

County in 2009 and she and her family lived V-

next to a coal—processing plant.

Gibson said that, despite visible clouds of
black smoke, government officials ignored
his claims of rampant pollution. Helsaid

Black construction tarp sparks fire scare

By Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor . 7

Sophomore Bryan Peck evacuated his com-
munication class from’ the second ﬂoor of
the ‘Cathedral of Learning Wednesday’af—
ternoon. ’ ' ‘
“Nobody thinks it’s a big deal  It’s the
biggest academic building,” he said, as the
class of more than 10 students gathered on
the William. Pitt Union patio for an alterna-
tive learning location. _
Rumors of ﬂames coming from close
to the top of the 42-ﬂoor Cathedral spread
across campus late yesterday afternoon._

-But the Cathedral of Learning was not '

going up in ﬂames — in fact, there weren’t
any ﬂames involved in the scene at all. _

Pitt spokesmanjohn Harvith conﬁrmed
that the alarm was actually caused by “some

' sort of tarp reﬂecting light” that workers '
had put up on theﬂoor in question, which

is currently undergoing construction.
He-said he was unsure about what the

ﬂoor was used‘ for before renovations be-

gan, but a plaque still hanging on'one un-

' touched wall pointed to a “Research and
_Cost Accounting Receptionist” ofﬁce that

has since moved to Thackeray 
’ Peck said that his brother called him

when he was on his way to class _and re-

ported the possible ﬁre. .

He ‘shared the news when he reached
the class, and just after its 4:30 p.m. start
time, he and his c1assmates°were outside
again. ' ’

. The class continued on the patio, with’,

some of the students’ necks craned toward
the 31st ﬂoor’s rectangular windows that

appeared black when not struck by sun- _

light. Perhaps the black was smoke, some
classmates suggested.

Aside from those outside, rumors also-

lit up the inside of the Cathedral._

Matt. Schultz, the receptionist at the
Honors College, said he had heard talk of
' yellow caution tape ﬂapping a few ﬂoors

below that resembled ﬂames.

Around 4 p.m., he received a phone call
from a television news station asking about
a ﬁre. Schultz said he took a minute to look
around to conﬁrm. the ﬁre-free space on
the 36th ﬂoor and reported that there was
no ﬁre to the news source. _

“It must have been really convincing,”
Schultz said. @ T

“I included a personal story when writing

Rothenberger said.

Rothenberger said it is important to fo-
cus on the way that students can positively
impact the current situation and work on

cutting down or eliminating the cuts in Cor-

bett’s budget proposal._ _
“We must use what we have and focus on

enhancing our school and our community

Junior Kaitlyn Subersaid that the impact
of the proposed budget cuts would affect

.Victor said in an email that letter—writing
campaigns can still be effective even if all
letters are not read by legislators.

“The beneﬁt of such campaigns comes
more in the publicity of an issue to a popula-
tion rather than in the direct effect on legisla-
tion,” Victor.said. “The goal of letter-writing
campaigns is often to raise awareness about

an issue (among the general population or

among legislators) rather than to try to im- _

pact a piece of legislation in the processﬁ’

And while the letters'might raise aware— _ ‘
; ness, she said they often don’t haveamuch ‘

impact in terms of actual legislation.

“The probability that legislators-would
affect the substance of a bill or itsposition
in the process based ‘on letters received by
constituents is very low,” Victor said.

. Though students acknowledged that writ- .

ing letters might not succeed in changing
their legislators’ minds, they agreed that
it is still an effective step in having their
voices heard.

“I don’t think that you should have to
change the quality of your education be-
cause you can’t afford it,” Halperin said.
“The stack [of letters] is a pretty good size

and growing, so even if the. legislators don’t ‘ '

read them, hopefully tliey’ll at least see how
many people are upset by this.” ﬂ ~

THE STAMATTACK

Celebrate initiative during Pitt’s 225th anniversary

‘By Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

It’s not ‘every Feb. 28 that a university celebrates
its 225th anniversary. But although many depart-

'_ ments are commemorating the occasion in some

way or another, few have embraced Pitt’s “225 Acts
of Caring” initiative. _ ' ' "

This initiative seeks to encourage volunteerism
amongst students, faculty and '

- what Pitt could become instead what it already is.

By treating the anniversary not only as a celebra-

' tion‘of the past, buta prediction of the future, the

message’s power could have improved tomorrow’s
University of Pittsburgh.

From a student—life perspective, our campus
could beneﬁt from a few inspiring slogans. In 2011
The Daily Beast named us the 20th-least-rigorous
university, so “225 Acts of Industriousness,” while
a bit of a mouthful, could have pushed us into a
more respectable position. There’s also a wide-

spread and somewhat valid

staff. It ﬁts nicely with the an-
niversary’s overall “Building
Better Lives” theme,‘and pro-
motes the image of the Uni-
versity as a positive inﬂuence
in the community. Plus, “225
Acts of Caring” will look and
sound appealing on Univer-

cations. .

We might be missing an-
opportunity by choosing this _
as our slogan, however. While
we would neverwant to cham-
pion something controversial
or even brow—raising — “225
Celebrations of Reproductive
Rights” just doesn’t sit well
4 we should want something
that at least challenges us in.

_ some meaningful way.

After all, these kind of cam-

complaint that Pitt stu-
dents lack schoolgspirit —
“225 Acts of Pride” might
help remedy this.

Many people might
nonethelesstake issue with
either of these slogans: The
ﬁrst has too many S’s to
be useful and “225 Acts of
Pride” evokes either “The
Lion King” or LGBTQ is-

sues — neither of which
represents the entire cam-
pus."

. In any case, there’s one
slogan that could still have
effectively addressed more
aspirational goals: “2g5
Acts of Initiative.” .

On thesurface, this is
admittedly a_ bit redun-
dant: An act of anything --

paigns are at least marginally

instrumental in changing the

character of aplace. If nothing else, they help to
set an overall atmosphere. "Consider the Olympic
opening ceremonies: the 2008 Beijing Olympics
opening song, which roughly translated to"‘China
is awesome,” might not- have inﬂuenced the actual
awarding of medals, but it nonetheless deeply im-
pacted the feel of the games. Because “225 Acts of

- Caring” will appear everywhere, the impact here

will be similar: While technically «inconsequential,
it will still be important in establishing our sense
of identity.  '
Unfortunately, “225 Acts of Caring” just restates
everything we already know about this University.
Events like Pitt Make a Difference Day and Alter-
native Spring Break constantly remind us of our
responsibility to society. Our brochures already
espouse the life-improving innovations of our
medical research. Even the Pitt Promise emphasiz-

es the “development of a caring community” with

“concern for others.” -

In short, we already know that this University
cares about creating locally and globally attuned
citizens. By making the. effort our anniversary
theme as well, we’re wasting potential; it’s as if Chi-

‘ na were using the opening ceremonies to say noth-

ing more than, “These are the opening ceremonies
of the Olympics.” . '
It would have been wiser to focus our slogan on

caring or otherwise ~— is a

I sign of initiative. But on a deeper level, the phrase

embodies all that is good about the University and
all that could be good: a perfect balance for our
opening ceremonies. V

It calls attention to the ways we already-show"

initiative as a group — our hundreds of self-start-
ed student organizations and self-started research
projects, for example. ' _ '.
More importantly, however, the slogan offers
guidance on how to make the University a better
place. Individual acts of initiative distinguish ex-

cellent academic commu_nities from average aca-

demic ‘communities. A few students. with initiative
are all that separate this school from aprouder
school with more numerous and meaningful tradi-
tions. ' _ - _ ‘

If this sounds deliriously high—minded, it is. But
these sort of campaigns are designed that way.,We
don’t watch Olympic opening ceremonies for ad-
vice on how to ﬁle our taxes -- we watch them be-
cause their messages transcend the boring details
of our day-to-day lives. V .

Our 225th anniversary is an occasion to cel-
ebrate something of symbolic signiﬁcance. While

“225 Acts of Caring” is a laudable directive, it. ’

doesn’t fullyaembrace a more forward-looking atti-
tude that could improve the University in the next
225 years. I

‘COLUMN

 

  I By Sarah Reagle
- Columnist

 

People go to bars to drink, right? Right. But
people don’t just ﬂock to bars for alcohol.
If that were the case, we’d all stay at home
and drink with our friends to save money.
The other reason people go to bars is
to be social and make nice with complete
strangers. Some people are better at this
than others. If you’re the type of person

who gets fake numbers, doesn’t get any._

numbers at all or gets the brush-off, this
is for you. Maybe I can help you ﬁgure out
what you’re doing wrong -—- maybe even

how to do it right. Or maybe I’ll just betray V

my lack of social skills. We’ll see. ‘

Conversation starters:

_ This is a crucial moment. Please don’t
make it weird. And if you’re a boy, please
don’t wait for the moment when a‘ girl’s
friend leaves her alone at the table to make

your move. We know what you’re up to,_

and we’re not pleased. .

Other to-do_n’ts include intetjecting
supposedly witty comments at the start of
the conversation. Why, yes, I_do go to Pitt.

Yes, I major in both Englishland art his-_‘

tory. Wow, no, no one has ever made that
joke about my job prospects before. Good
one. That’ll totally keep me talking to you.

That scenario ‘included another to-
don’t: Don’t ask about someone’s major.
Or more generally, don’t make the sort of
small talk that’ll recreate a conversation
we’ve all had a billion times.’

Instead of any" of the above, try to be

a little more genuine and a little more

original. Compliment someone’s cloth-
ing choices rather than playfully insulting
them. Find ‘a mutual interest — a sport,
a television show, a recent movie —' and
talk about it. If you see someone wearing a
hockey jersey and you’re nuts over hockey,
start there. - ~

This seems really basic, but you’d be
surprised how few good conversations I’ve

. had with strangers in‘ bars. Or maybe you

February» 23, 2012 I The Pitt News I \/\/vvvv.pittrtevvs,.c0rn

wouldn’t be surprised at all.

One more thing: Don’t start the conver-
sation by saying you just want to steal my
booth at Hemingway’s since it looked like I
was leaving soon. It won’t end well.

Wingmen and wingwomen:

“How I.Met Your Mother” taught me
that ‘it’s pretty crucial to have a Ted or a
Barney at your side when meeting new
people. It really is easier to have a conver-
sation when you’re with a friend.

What you shouldn’t take away from
Barney is that, lying" to people is okay. It’s

' hilarious and maybe even legen —'wait for

it —— dary on the show, but it doesn’t work
well in real life. Don’t say your name is Jas-
per when it’s Jesse. Don’t make up elabo-

-rate schemes about how you’re leaving on

a months-long expedition to the arctic the
next. day. Just don’t lie. Theldifference be-
tween you and Barney is that your life isn’t

a television show. It’ll be fun fora little, but
you or one of your friends will slip up, and

then you’ll just look silly. '

Drink-buying etiquette: - . I

I always ﬁnd drink offers a nice gesture.
Most of the girly magazines I’ve read have
told me that I should always, always, al-
ways accept a drink, even if I ﬁnd the buyer
entirely repulsive. Then I’m supposed to

chat up this drink-buyer for ﬁve minutes,

thank him and excuse myself. V

I might be in the minority, but I’veal-
ways found this to be a littledeceitﬁil. I
think it’s OK to politely say no, and I think
the drink-buyer should respect that. The
latter doesn’t always happen. The ﬁrst time
someone offered to buy me a drink, I said
no. The person then proceeded to bully me
into it, and awkward conversationensued.
Obviously after that meet-cute, we fell in
love and are living happily ever after. '

Here’s the bottom line: If you want to

make a good impression, make the offer.» If a

he or she says no, accept it and move on. If
it’s a yes, that’s great. Just don’t follow up
the offer by asking what his or her major
is. You’re better than that.

~ Pick-up lines: -

Just don’t use pick-up lines. It’s not cool,
and it’s not so uncool that it’s reverted to
being cool again. “It’s my birthday. Guess
how old I am?” won’t work, ‘you clever
30-year-olds; Neither will, “I’ll treat you
like my homework — slam you on the table
and do you all night long,” you nerds. And,
“Do you have any [insert ethnicity here] in

“you?” will never, ever work for anyone.

Asking for numbers: .
If at the end of a nice conversation you

decide you’d like to have another nice con- ,

versation, ask for anumber. It’s that sim-
ple. Just use your words. Don’t make your
friend ask, and don’t just hand over your

‘number and‘ expect the other person to

call you. Don’t be a scaredy-cat, and don’t
play games.

. If you’re really into it, make tentative"
plans for the ﬁiture. Ask about getting din-

Bretiquette: A guide to avoidings embarrassment

ner during the following week..The worst
that’ll happen is that it won’t happen.
Hopefully these wordsof pseudo—wis-
dom will help you make some new con-
nections next time you’re out at a bar. Or
maybe you’re just thinking to yourself,
“I’m never ‘approaching that girl in a bar.

. Geez.” But if you’re not thinking that, try

out some of these tactics next time you’re
out scouting for friends.

And perhaps after. all this work, you’ll
ﬁnd the next morning that your new best
friend o_r soul mate refuses to respond to
your text and will pretend to have never
met you when you pass each other on the
street. Sometimes that happens. It’s the

' risk we take when we make friends with

the help ‘of alcohol. But maybe the person
will respond, and you’ll have a new friend.
And that’ll be maximum awesome.- I

LETTER To THE EDITOR
To the Editor,‘ ‘‘

The suits of UPMCheap have done
it again. It is well-known that the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Medical Center

V (UPMC) has been criticized for exces-
sive proﬁts as a nonproﬁt organiza-
tion. For the 2010-2011 ﬁscal year, the
operating revenue generated by UPMC
was more than $9 billion, with a proﬁt

of $406 million. One of the advertised ~

strengths of UPMC is research. The

medical school and afﬁliated hospitals '

_receive' over $400 million annually

’ from the National Institute of Health .

for research pursuits.

As.a graduate of the University of
"Pittsburgh School of Medicine and as
a surgery resident for UPMC, I rely
heavily on the University of Pitts-
burgh Health Sciences-_Library Sys-
tem (HSLS) for research—related en-
deavors. The HSLS is the primary

library for researchers in all of the
schools of the health sciences.

But the scope of HSLS services avail-
able to the UPMC community has been
redeﬁned. Since Feb. 6, UPMC members
only have access to those eResources for
which UPMC provides budget support.

4 I can no longer borrow a book from this
library. I can no longer participate'in
- the interlibrary loan program. I can no
v longer use the HSLS computers to ac-
cess eResources because all UPMC user
' accounts have been terminated. Basi-
cally, I can no longer use the HSLS for
research —— except in a limited budget-
driven fashion. The suits should recon-
sider budgetary spending practices, as
that this gross oversight violates the
fundamental need to have full access
to medical resources when performing
medical research.

      Pop-punk notjust foradolescents,  

mature‘ hands worthwhile now

By]_e_ﬁ'rey Shucosky '
W ‘ontributor

   

Blink—18é recently announced a slew of
tour dates to commemorate the band’s
20th anniversary. , ' —

By the time the arena tour starts, bass-

A ‘ ist Mark Hoppus will be the ripe age of 40,

with bandmates Tom DeLonge and,Tra—

- 'vis Barker clocking in at 36. Although they
have attempted new, more mature sounds,

it’s fair to presume they’re still going to
sing aboutgrowing up and high. school
girlfriends, with the occasional dick joke
segue. '

In all likelihood, the group won’t be able
to recapture the magic of 1998, but it won’t
matter. Nostalgia is the driving factor in
a Blink anniversary tour. Butwhy satiate
yourself "with memories of junior high?

Just dive right back into the sea of pop—‘
‘ punk and ﬁnd it exactly as you remember

‘it: honest, fast and fun. ‘

Pop-punk has meant a lot of things t
its listeners over the years. ~ . ‘

It was heartfelt enough that you could
put Blink-182’s “Josie” on the mixtape you
were making for your hopeful date to the
big school dance, yet rebellious enough
that you had to hide it from your parents
so they wouldn’t see that dreaded Paren-
tal Advisory sticker. It was a time to meet
your friends in the parking lot of the lo-
cal VFW — another fact hidden from your
parents -— to wait for the doorsito open for
the show so you could buy T-‘shirts made
with stencils in a drummer’s garage. You

shouted along to those gang choruses, tell- A
ing yourself that things were never going , 1

to change. ~

Then you grew up, decided that pop— A ‘
punk was kids’ stuff unﬁt for your massive

intellect and that the genre as a whole was
garbage. The ‘music elitist in you some-

_how convinced you that fast-pacedmusic

brimming with authenticity and fun was
beneath you simply because there were
no more dances in the school gym. Do not
fall for this trap. There are plenty of good,

. relevant bands in the. genre for the twenty-
.something»in college. .' '

While a good chunk of pop—punk is still
about‘ friendship and relationships, this
isn’t-a bad thing. It’s not like these issues
disappear at any point in your lifetime.
The trick is ﬁnding the bands that write
about these things while also ﬁnding ways
to make them more age—relevant. Thanks
to the widespread availability of music
through sites like Bandcamp and If You
Make It, there’s something for everyone.

Feeling bummed‘ and need a re_minder

‘of the people who help you through it?

Check out Spraynard’s Funtitled, an album
ﬁlled with positivity about subjects such as
giving up Video games for the sake of real-
world accomplishments and ﬁnding your-
self with the help of friends.

Maybe you’re still lost in the world but.
want to be happy and jam. Iron Chic’s Not »

Everyone loves a good adventure. And a
journey experienced through the eyes of
a girl no more than a few inches tall who
lives under the ﬂoorboards of a house is
one of the biggest adventures movie audi-
ences can go on. _ .

“The Secret World of Arrietty” — origi-,
nally titled “The Borrower Arrietty?’ — ﬁ-
nally- debuted in the United States two
years after its Japanese release. This marks
the widest distribution of a ﬁlm by Studio
Ghibli —. sort of like Japan’s Pixar —— in the

' United States. -

V Based on ﬁrst book in Mary Norton’s
children’s series “The Borrowers,” the ﬁlm
focuses on the Clock family, a group of
three people who are almost exactly like
‘normal humans — except for the fact that
they measure no" more than four ‘inches
tall. .- - _
The Clocks live underneath a coun-
try house in Japanl The main character,
14-year-old Arrietty (Bridgit Mendler), is

a free spirit who often ventures outside of v

the safety ‘of the family’s tiny home to gath-
er ﬂowers and herbs, despite the constant
risk of being eaten by cats or birds — or

worse, being spotted by a normal human. _

Denison Witmer plays with sound on newest album to mixed results 1

By Natalie Bell
_ Magazine Editor

Denison Witmer seems to be experiment-
ing. -
His latest album,-The Ones Who Wait,

seems like a hodge-podge of styles as Wit-'

mer strives to grow in his sound. Some-
times the effort works in the singer’s favor,

ARRIETTY

FROM PAGE ll

with goirig on an adventure shine through
because of the amazing world created on
screen. It’s a very recognizable world, and
yet, seen through Arrietty’s eyes, the mun-
dane becomes marvelous and fanciful.
Like all Studio Ghibli ﬁlms, “Arrietty”
features fantastic-animation. Fans of the
studio have come to expect hand—drawn
animation mixed with water—colored

landscapes, and “Arrietty” does not dis-.

appoint, as the artwork highlights basic
details like texture on normal household
items, giving the ﬁlm a feeling of authen-
ticity. I

Additionally, Ghibli ﬁlms have an un-
canny ability to touch on several important
themes, and .“Ar,r,ietty”,is no exception.

Viewlemcan F’-?<pect,?l¥?..-’$¥11?!F‘=1°te!*§s¥9 deal
wit_h-friendship across '_cu1‘tur'.a'1 divides, the L

discussion of recycling versus stealing, ill-

ness and the ﬁnality of death, and even an A

— admittedly brief — look at the plight of
refugees. A

Great characters are also what fans have
come to expect from Ghibli ﬁlms. Arrietty
perfectly balances the emotions of a young
girl with strength and courage. Her trade-
mark outﬁt throughout the ﬁlm — a red
dress, boots and a pin that rests at her side
like a sword —— only highlights her strong
personality. ‘ ~ .

Balancing out the cast, Arrietty’s father

.ti

acts as a calm leader, and her mother as
the worrying caretaker. The housekeeper,
whose cackle is as menacing as her size to,
the Borrowers, adds the right amount of
tension while also providing an element of
humor. '

What’s arguably missing in this ﬁlm
is magic, which has appeared in most of
Ghibli’s past ﬁlms. And while Ghilbi’s ﬁlms
almost always take place in fantastic lands
inspired byjapanese myth, “Arrietty” takes
place in the real world.

But this is not necessarilya bad thing.
Looking at a home through the eyes of a
tiny, passionate girl is certainly not bor-
ing,~especially when the animators take
the time to emphasize the slightest of de-
tails. This is a world where postage stamps
become wall decorations and small drop-
lets of water amount to heavy bucket
loads.‘ Kitchen counters ‘become moun-

‘Through sheer scaling and strong char-
acterization, the normal world has become
foreign, strange and magical. So while “The
Secret World of Arrietty” lacks the inten-
sity of Ghibli ﬁlms like “Princess Monon-
oke” and “Spirited Away,” it remains an
enjoyable piece of work that breaks step
with typical computer-animated children’s
ﬁlms, opting for a slower — but still grand
— adventure. 3; »

By R_] Sepich
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Seven-year— old Holly Ap rile loved
watching her father play softball
atthe local park when she was
growing up in the small town of
Aston in upstate New York. But
watching the action from the
sidelines wasn’t what Aprile and
her older sister really desired.

They wanted to play.

“My sister and I were just kind
of like little ﬁeld rats,” Aprile
said. “We picked up the game
from watching the men play, so
we just started running around in
the ﬁeld.” - _ '

When Aprile’s father signed

her up for organized softball the A

next year, she was hooked.

Aprile — who is now enter-
ing her fourth season as the head
coach of the Pitt softball team
— worked her way through the
ranks playing and coachingher
father’s sport.

Aprile’s players subscribed
to -her coaching philosophy and
goals as she put together three-
consecutive winning seasons at

“the helm of the Panthers’ pro-

gram, . -
Pitt junior catcher Holly Ste-
vens said she believes Aprile’s

' biggest asset as a coach is her

ability to motivate the team in
‘any situation with a positive at-
titude.

“Even when we’re struggling,
she’s a really positive person and
wants ‘us to be mentally tough,”
Stevens said. “She’s one of the
best coaches I’ve‘ ever had.”.

Aprile agreed that she focuses
onbeingpositive but admitted she
wasn’t that way during her more
than 10-year playing career.

“I’ve learned that it’s not about
what happened, it’s about what’s
on the horizon,” she said. “It’s
important to be able to be resil-
ient, but I, wasn’t always that way
as a player — I deﬁnitely wasn’t
Miss Upbeat then.”

Upbeat or not, Aprile, 42, en— "

joyed a noteworthy career on the
diamond at both the collegiate
and international levels.

After committing to play col-
lege softball as a pitcher and
outﬁelder at the University of
Massachusetts — Amherst, she

SPORTS 1

Pitt headcoach establishes winning program   C

Ryan Samson: [For The Pitt News

The I’iu softball team has put together three consecutive winning seasons under head coach I-lolly Aprilu (la-ft).

four consecutive Atlantic 10 con-
ference titles from 1989 to 1992
and was a strong contributor to
the team that earned the school’s
ﬁrst trip to the College World Se-
ries in 1992. .

For her role in the_ Minute-

’ women’s success, Aprile received

the conference’sr'Player of the
Year honor three times and was
named an All-American. ‘

“My time there was really, re-
ally good,” Aprile said of ‘her ca-
reer at UMass. “My senior year
we got it all together, and it was a
tremendous experience.” _ .

With a playing style she de-

- scribes as versatile and tenacious,

Aprile’s performances in col-
lege caught the eye of the United
States Softball Women’s National

_ Team —— the highest level in the

game. .
“I think they liked me because
I was what they called a ‘ﬁve—tool
player,”’ she said. _In baseball
and softball, "the ﬁve tools are
the ability ‘to run fast, ﬁeld well,
throw hard and hit with both a
good average and power.
' ‘Aprile accepted the National

Team’s invitation and made ap—'

pearances in international tour-

naments off—and—on for the next V

seven years. I
Simultaneously, she began a
career in coaching. ,
Starting off as a graduate as-
sistant at Eastern Illinois Univer-
sity in 1994, Aprile was surprised
when she receivedan offer" to be
the pitching coach at the Univer-

sity of South Carolina the next‘

year. ‘

“I went to Eastern Illinois to
get a graduate degree in political
science, so I was thinking about
law school,” she said. ,“But then a
friend from South Carolina called
me and asked if I wanted to be the

‘ pitching coach there. I thought,

well, Icoulcl keep doing this.”
Eight successful years as an
assistant with the Gamecocks
followed, as‘Aprile helped lead
South Carolina to seven NCAA
Regional appearances and one
trip to the College World Series.
Looking for a new challenge
and the" opportunity to‘ move
closer to home, she accepted an-
other assistant coaching job offer

from a friend. Michelle Phalen,.

the ﬁrst head coach in Pitt’s short
softball history, invited her to

' Pittsburgh to help guide the new

Panther program_’s growth.

Pitt softball played its inau-
gural season in 1998 and joined
the Big East the next spring. Al-
though the program consistently

‘ improved during its early years,

the Panthers didn’t ‘achieve a

' winning record in conference

play for a decade.

‘ When Aprile arrived prior to
the 2004 season, she knew build-
ing a national powerhouse at Pitt
would be a challenge. But it was a
challenge she wanted to face.

“When I got here, the ﬁeld

was basically a cut—out of dirt _

and it deﬁnitely wasn’t spectator-
friendlyat all,” she said. “How—
ever, when Phalen ﬁrst started
the program they were playing at
local parks, so it was deﬁnitely an
improvement over that. I knew
the program was building and I
wanted to be a part of it.”

After ﬁve years coaching the
pitchers, Pitt offered Aprile the
head coaching position when
Phalen decided to pursue oppor-
tunities outside of softball. Aprile
didn’t have to think twice about
whether or not to accept.

The Panthers have ﬂourished
under Aprile. '

_ Pitthasrecordedthreestraight
winning seasons for the ﬁrst time

-in‘ the program’s now 14-year his-

tory, and the Panthershave slow-
ly ‘established ‘themselves ‘as one
of the better softball programs in

-the Big East conference.

Aprile hopes that this season

' — Pitt’s second playing at its

impressive new home at Vart—
abedian Field in the Petersen
Sports Complex —- could be the
breakthrough year for Panthers
softball. .

f‘We’re focused on winning
the Big East,” she said. “We’ve

‘established ourselves in the con-

ference and now we have tolbe

-:-

able to show up and beat the”bet- ‘

ter teams in the conference on a
more consistent basis.”

Senior inﬁelder Niki Cognigni,
who joined Pitt softball the same
year Aprile was named head

-coach, said Aprile’s continuous

belief in her players and the pro-
gram inspires everyone to play to
their full potential.

“She cares- about us so much
and we work that much harder to
succeed knowing she wants us to
be the best we can be,” Cognigni
said. 4%
