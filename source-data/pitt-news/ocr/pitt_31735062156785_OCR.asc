George M. Lynn, president of the congress, followed up the

telegram to Mike Milligan and

in effect that the probe was not directed toward him or the

Informants close to the squad

There will be a pep, rally before

Alumnus Wins
Commendation

Arthur H. Thompson, Law ’47,
has been commended by the State
Planning Board for his legal in-
vestigation in the control of ad-
vertising on state highways.

In a treatise entitled “Billboards
and Zoning,” Thompson explains
the possibility of controlling ad-
vertising along the state highways.

The treatise also recommends a
statute zoning all state highways
as the most efficient way of pro-
tecting the state’s interest in the
beauty of the highways.

This is one of the ﬁrst investi-
gations into this phase of the law,

and are compulsory for all new

High academic records and

Second Chance

“Claw the Irish!” the posters shouted.
, “-Come to the pep rally, Friday, October 3
at 12:30 and show the team you want a vic-
tory/. . ” Some did come, some did yell,
some did show that they were with the team.
Many did not.
Perhaps it was because pep rallies are “kid
stud.” The vets, the juniors, and the seniors are
. too old to go around yelling their heads off
about football. Why, somebody might actually
get the idea that they cared about the game
if they “carried on” ‘at a“ pep rally.

 one. It wasn’t well organized or well directed:

They stood a good chance for an upset, as the

A week before indicated that the team was no
pushdver; they merited the school ’s support.
“Pep rallies are ‘kid stuff,’ not for vets,-
upper classmen and ‘sophisticates’ (note the
quotes here) . I .” Well, pep rallies aren’t “kid
stuff.” Neither is football. Pep rallies are sup-
posed to workup enthusiasm for the game,
' for the team, and that sort of thing isn’t re-
stricted to ﬁfteen year—olds. It’s for everyone
who wants to'see their team win. If fellows

Dear Editor:

Letters to the Editor . . —.

Pitt Graduate H
Athletilc Pro'gram

its

For the past several years the football fortunes of our
school have been dragged through the gutters in such a man-
ner that an explanation is certainly long overdue the good
people of the city_,of Pittsburgh. ‘ .

As an aftermath of the Bowman-Harrison versus Suther-
land feud,’ football was trumped down and sent to the cleaners '

to be made Simon pure.

The Athletic Department, un-
doubtedly taking orders from up
front, set up one of the toughest
football schedules in the country
and removed from Sutherland’s

,hands the tools with which the
good doctor accomplished his task.’

Jock was not so foolish as to
attempt to go on against hopeless.
odds and the upshot of the whole
affair was his resignation.

This may have been soul-satis-
fying to some, but it certainly was
the beginning of the dark ages in
Pitt football history.

What has transpired since that
time up to the present is
worthy of note. ,

The numerous coaches, together
with many ﬁne boys, who have
given their best efforts, can sure-
ly not be asked to assume any
part of the blame. Only the Ath-
letic Department must be held re-
_sponsible. .

Signiﬁcant indeed is the fact
that Notre Dame howled loud and
long about Panther professional-
ism, ﬁnally dropping Pitt as an
opponent after the latter had hung
it on the Irish with overbearing
consistency. The same South
Benders jumped at ‘the opportu-
nity of returning deﬂated Pitt to
their schedule as soon as they
.wer.e sure the bubble had been
broken.

Pitt’s football reputation, as es-
tablished by the Sutherland re-
gime, is still‘ fresh in the minds
of all who saw the games during
that era.

Unfortunately a toothless and
clawless Panther is being asked to
carry on today.

.How long Pitt will be offered
up as a football door mat to other
top ﬂight schools remains to be
seen. . -
Let’s man the cars again and
do what every big school with a
decent‘ football team is doing.

Offer the players their tuition
if they can- play football, maintain
a respectable standard for scholas-
tic‘ requirements and if the boys

the world what's going on and let
it go at that..

If ‘any school is too pious to ac-
cept those conditions then allow

ﬁn use as little /horse-sense. and

hardly .

meet these conditions then tell —

draft a schedule calling for games
with such schools as Geneva,

.Waynesburg, Thiel, Grove City,

Case, etc.

The fans might thus be afford-
ed the opportunity of ‘seeing
something competitive, at least
once in a while.

Yours truly,

Gerald K. McKee,
Ch.  ’29.

 

Dear Editor: '

The weekend of October tenth
a group of the finest boys who
ever wore a Pitt uniform, were
sacriﬁced to a large dollar sign
and the questionable determina-

tion of the At-hleticdepartment to

get into the Big Nine.

When a University is willing to
sacrifice’ itself and crucify its
football team to a big gate receipt
something is wrong. The Athletic
department of this school insists
.on sending its simon pure teams
against the not so pure teams of
the Western Conference. The ad-
ministration wants to adhere to a
set of standards set lip by a group
of schools who do not ﬁnd it con-
venient to follow their own rules.

At other colleges the afumni
would scream and heads '-would
roll. Mr. Hagan and company
may thank their lucky stars that
Pitt doesn’t have that kind of an
alumni.

If this school wants to play
big-time football then let's pay
for a big-time team, but if we
Want to play a sociable game, let's

defeats not only give the school a
bad name, but actually hamper
its graduates. People think of the

"After the

Back y  
 Ball is Over", 4,: ».

by Bill Veenis

The Harvest Moon Hop last Friday night 

started off what appears to be a great season
for Pitt dancers. It seems that it is also a good
season for the dance promoters. Jack Mans-

mann, general pusher of the committee,‘ radiat-
ed on the occasion because the dance moved in- -

to the black long before the ﬁrst half hour
passed. by.

There was nothing about the dance that
might be called spectacular. The decorations
consisted of a lonely moon silhouet at one end
of the dance ﬂoor. Brad Hunt’s orchestra has
been accused of many ‘things, but greatness is

not one of the accusations. Yet, his music was

certainly ‘ ‘ danceable.”

The Messrs. Lupowitz and Riley, with a
script like a corn-bin, were able to scare up
more than a few laughs during the intermission.

And the community sing ﬁnale completed the ,

“loosen up and enjoy yourselves” program.

In short,'tl_1e dance was good—not great.
But, it stands out in comparison with dances
of the past few years. Not once during the
evening did the entertainment drag. Nor did
anyone seem pushed to have a good time.

‘A word of thanks should go to the Arm-
stead-Mansmann-Wilde trio and their able as-
sistants for promoting an enjoyable affair . . .-
and for providing a strong challengeto the
dance committees on deck for the remainder
of the season.

A in the nation.

Capt. J. D. Hunter, drill coach,
was prancing on the rug, gesticu-
, plating and at the same time ex-
« claiming to band director Robert
L. Arther, “This is _the best idea
for a forma-tion I ever had! Ohio
State will have a hard time
matching it!” And he went on
demonstrating.

Searching for good ideas is the
" greatest problem Capt. Hunter en-
counters when he is mapping out
intricate formations for a band
' that paces over 160 steps per min-
ute. But when they strike him
they are effective and sharp.

For every football game, he pre-
pares a series of colorful march-
ing patterns which are coordinat-
ed with special music adaptations
- arranged by Arthur. He strives
for an effect to give every spec-
tator in the stadium the same View
‘of the marching men. “

~ ' When the band is performing
on_ the gridiron, its steps are
measured from the moment the
ﬁrst man crosses the south goal
post line until the last one reaches
the white stripe at the other end
of the ‘ﬁeld. Brain racking enters
the picture when the captain has

Capt. Hunter’s oﬁicial military
duties in the University include
instructing the sophomore class in
the ROTC. When a newcomer
enters the freshman marching
band, he is ﬁrst drilled through
the basic military routine. Then
his steps are ampliﬁed to suit the

band commdnder, helps to ease the
captain’s burden.

Sin-ce the band will meet its
stiffest competitors for highest

Capt. Hunter has concocted a
number of "marching patterns that
should place the band in the top
rung. If the captain’s enthusiasm
is any criterion, that goal will be

easily attained.

‘ Robert Wanted
Francis Found

You’d know it would happen at
Pitt.

One day last week a. woman wan-
dered into the Dean of Men’s Of-
ﬁce followed by a small boy. She
was looking for her son, Robert.
He hadn’t been home for two
nights, and she was on the verge
of reporting, him to the Missing
Persons Bureau.

First, though, she thought of
trying to ﬁnd him at school, so she
asked one of the secretaries to
look up his schedule. She didn’t
know much about his classes, but
she had the impression that he
might be taking some kind of
psychology.

The girl looked for his card, but
instead of ﬁnding Robert,’ she
found Francis ‘Leo-pold, another
student with the same East name.
The woman looked puzzled for a
minute; then her face cleared.
“That’s my other boy,” she said.
“Now I remember.‘Robert wanted
topgo to Pitt, but it was too crowd-
ed. He must have gone to Car-
negie Tech.” ,

Leaving the girl standing there
gasping for breath, she walked
tranquilly out of the office, pre-
sumably on her way to the Tech
campus.

Silverman, Bl-astsAi'ts Dept.-'
Sug/gests New Lab Course

The new trend in science edu-9
cation for liberal ‘arts students
got a ﬁrm rapping last week from
Dr. Alexander Silverman, head of
the chemistry department.

“Liberal arts students here at.

the University still are able’ to
choose their science courses free-
ly, despite the trend toward a
required course in general sci-
ence,” Dr. Silverman announ-ced.
‘The new trend started at'Yale
last year with a two—year lecture
course in broad scientiﬁc prin-
ciples ‘in which the members of
the various science departments
imparted the basic truths and ap-
plications of modern science.

A similar ‘course offered here

after World War Iwas unsuccess-
ful, according to Dr. Sil.verman.
“We found out,” Dr. Silverman
went on, “that a college student
will learn more science through
an intensive laboratory course in

   

 

 

‘ .. 3' $3eci—-List ‘Iz Iéqoioo ‘&e'pSan.I.'«*"sMi"N uldléﬂl

one science than through two I

years of broad, generalized lec-
tures. Such a course is of more
use to a layman seeking explana-
tions for the new discoveries» of
science that affect his everyday
existence.” _

Dr. Silverman beligves thatthe
undergraduate student is better
ﬁtted to specialize to some extent
in a branch of science voluntari-
ly chosen, and that he willlearn
more by doing so. i

Four Caddies Confess
Anemic-Golf-s-Games

The Caddie Welfare Fund of the West P-enn Golfers Association 1

has sent four former caddies to Pitt this fall, but not one shoots a

decent game of golf.
This is the confession of James

Maloney, Chartiers Country Club,

Earl Jacob, Lon-gue Vue Country Club, and Lawrence Loefﬂer, Oak-

mont Country Club.

The scholarships, paid for jointly by the -Welfare Fund and the.

University, were won on the basise
of outstanding high school records
in studies and extra-curricular ac-
tivities. Approximately 20 can-
didates competed for the awards.
Not only in studies were the
boys at the tops of their classes,

but in popularityeas well. Maloney
and J acob‘ were senior class pres-
idents of Carnegie and Penn High
Schools, respectively. Maloney was
graduated fourth in his class,
while Jacob ranked fourteenth.

Dinzeo, the veteran caddie in
thegroup with six years of experi-
ence, has been hauling clubs since
he was 12, although the minimum
age requirement is 14.

In the course of their years of
eaddying, the boys have frequent-
ly carried the club of such Pirate
players as Rip Sewell, Ralph Ki-
ner,-and ALLopez. Local golf clubs
make it a practice to invite such
players as their guests.

Asked if the Buccos were good

tippers, Loefﬁer replied, “Sure,
you should see them tip their hats
to the ladies.”

Loefﬂer is studying civil engi-
neering; Maloney, mechanical en-
gineering; Dinze0,_. industrial en-
gineering; and -Jacob, accounting
in the School of Business Admin-
istration.

, The Caddie Welfare Committee,
which is responsible for the schol-
arship ‘plan, is, headed by C. K.
Robinson, local attorney. A total
of seven boys are now enrolled at
Pitt on caddie scholarships.

Sumpter, Radnor
Star Defensively
In Panther Loss

I Pitt’s pass defense Saturday was
really pitiful. End Lou Mihaljovich
took full advantage of this dis-

crepancy to add to his impressive

pass catching record. He parked
in the center of the Pitt secondary
most of the afternoon and snag-
ged tosses while three or four Pitts
looked on. 1

The center of Pitt’s line was
in the game all the Way. Tony
Razzano played ﬁne ball until
he injured his knee late in the
ﬁrst period. His injury brought
Earl Sumpter one the scene and
he played a whale of a game.

The scrappy Negro guard from
Clairton practically cinched .a
starting berth for the Ohio State,
tilt. Included in the trio was Cen-
ter Len Radnor who played his
best ‘defensive game. Time and
‘again, he came up with some vici-
ous tackles.

That was a nice gesture on the
part of the Indiana band when
Pitt scored in the third quarter.
They played “Hail to Pitt’ and the
Stadium arouse en mass to ap-
plaud the Panthers. ’

Prior to the game, Ohio State
scouts reported that the student
body at Columbus put on the big-
gest pep rally in many years. That
it paid oﬁ was quite evident by the
Ohio State fourth period upsurge
when they scored twice to_ tie
Iowa, 13-13.

As an enlisted man in the army,
Purdue’s football coach, Stu Hol-
comb, served three years as an
assistant coach at West Point.

Mark Heffelﬁnger, Minnesota
halfback is a kinsman of Yale’s
famed Pudge Heffelﬁnger.

Dame can be as good as last year.”
They were undefeated in ’46.

éwith what was to have been a’

joyous homecoming. No sooner had

the cheering died down than the,

groaning began.

It is expected that Fesler will

be looking for another job at the
end of the present contract with
his Alma Mater unless State does
something to quiet the wolves.
Probably the only thing that
would make the Ohio Alumni sit
up and behave would be a drastic
turn of the football fortune wheel
of the Buckeyes. ‘

Fesler returned home this year
to ﬁnd that hisfootball garden was
suffering from a serious drought.
Ohio State is inthe same predica-
ment as Pitt. They don’t have the
material to meet the schedule,
and the Alumni, who won’t listen

  
 
  

to excuses, are talking of lynch-,7

ing Fesler. ‘
Dropped Three Straight V
Ohio State has had a bad time

of it this season. The Buckeyes.

were lucky enough to win over
Missouri with a last minute
touchdown. Since then, f
dropped two and tied one.
The Scarlet and Gray have
strength in the backﬁeld but a
noticeably-weak line. Hit hard by
graduations and ineligibilities,
their replacements have proven
inadequate. Fesler was noted for
his good line at Pitt last year, but
he is among the ﬁrst to admit that
the credit goes to Mike Milligan.
Clark Shifty .
Ernie .Sensenbaugher» ,leads the
parade of backs. The,fa;st right-
halfback made his debut in the
Stadium in 1943. Sensenbaugher
and Companl took Pitt over, 46-_.
6. Then Ernie shifted to "West.

Point for three years and has just: i
this year returned to Buckeye-~

land. - .

Joe Whisler is the highly pub-
licized Ohio fullback. Big Joe
weighs 220 pounds and can run
hard.iTeaming with Whisler and
Sensenbaugher is a shifty Negro,
Jimmie Clark, who ‘does most of
the breakaway running. Clark
hits the scale at 175 and is noted
for his puzzling meandering on
the ﬁeld. C

Quarterbacks Shifted .

Fesler uses a pair of quarter-
backs alternately for his ﬁeld
marshalling. Pete Perini is an
excellent punter and can carry his
burden in the passing show,
Spelling Perini is Pandel Savic.
Savic is a sophomore and has
shown a lot of promise. ’

State’s starting line will prob-
ably show Dick Shannon and Jim
Hague at the ends. A pair of Jacks,
Wilson and Jennings, weighing 217
and 228 pounds respectively, W111
open at. the tackle posit1ong_
Guards Dave Temple on and\Ray
DiPierro will start along with
Howie ’Duncan, who will do the
centering.

This fray will mark the second
home appearance of the Panthers.
The two teams are more .evenly
matched than any the Pittites have
faced thus far. The boys are out
to show Wes Fesler that he should
have stuck around Pittsburgh.

 Indiana Loss

By John Golightly

Bloomington, Ind.AIf there’s any truth in the old adage that

 things have to get worse before they get better, the Panthers should
it be able to anticipate happier days. They put up their poorest per-

-formance of the season in losing to Indiana, 41-6.

lAnd despite the‘size of the

score,‘ there was little to choose

between the two teams. The Hoosiers had Taliaferro and a little

life, While the Panthers lacked both.
Indiana wrapped up the bal1¢

game with less than a minute re-
maining in the ﬁrst half. Follow-
ingja 65-yard boot by B111 Har-
disty ‘Twhich rolled out on the

Hoosier 2, the crimson and gray

rolled 98 yards in ﬁve plays.

The scoring play was a Taliafer-
ro to Jagade aerial which the lat-
ter pulled’ in on the Pitt 15 and
raced untouched for the score.
That" made it 21-0, and insured
complete enjoyment of the half-
timeceremonies by the Dad’s Day
crowd. V .

Prior to that, the Hoosiers tal-
lied one six‘ pointer on a deep
reverse by Dick Deranek from 21
yards out, and registered their
second via a Taliaferro to Groomes

isCI‘.een pass which covered 29

yards. _ .
Trailing 27-0 late in the third

~period, the Panthers moved 90

yards in ten plays for their only
score. Three first downs carried
to the Pitt 44. Then after losing
two yards on a reverse’, Cecconi
heaved toMcPeak on the Indiana
15 and he legged the remaining
distance for the score.

The fanciest bit of anti—climax

occured late in the ﬁnal period —

when Taliaferro hauled in a Rus-
sell pass on the Pitt 47 and’zip-
ped down, to the Panther nine.

En route Taliaferro put on a
jumping jack routine that enabled
himto elude seven of the Panthers
while he ,’cut- back and forth along
the sideline. ‘ .

“Among other things, Taliaferro

ppitched for two TD’s and scored
.two others on running plays. In

all, s Indiana completed 14 out of

20 attempts for 265 yards. This

tops last year's mark when they
connected on 11 out of 19 for 193
yards. 0

the coaching grade last week, when

pm Harriers Lose

To State Invaders

, Out-classed on the cinder path
as well as the gridiron, Pitt was
blanked last Saturday by the na-
tion's number one cross-country
team, Penn State. The Nittany
harriers crossed the line in a ﬁve-
way dead heat, paced by top U. S.
miler Gerry Karver at 28:19.

Pitt’s Ed Sudzina led the pack
for mo_re than_ half the. Schenley
Park course, but dropped back to
ﬁnish sixth at 28:22. The Lions’
ﬁve-way tie gave them 15 points
to Pitt's 40.

 

Hard-Fought Struggles Liven
Shadyside IM Football Card

Many bitterly fought struggles livened the atmosphere at Shady-
side ﬁeld last week, as the intramural footballers moved into their

third week.

In a fraternity league battle, the Phi Gams slaughtered the Sam-

mies, 3'9—0. Frame, Rebele,
the touchdowns. .

Marshall, Bean, and Hoffman registered

.After a rugged battle, the Pi Lambs emerged victorious over an

outscored but not
Lambda Chi six, 2__4-12. Lerner
scored twice, Lovener and Silber-

stein once for the winners. Kranz,

and Girman tallied for Lambda
Chi.

Theta Chi downed the Phi Delts

in a close one, 13-6. Bazzano and

Shirley crossed the goal for Theta

Chi. McCall was the lone touch-

down-maker for the Phi Delts.

T-he Independents came up with
a couple of torrid tussles. The
Tanglefeet squeezed by Y.M.C.A.,
13-12. A pass from Rafferty to
Woodcockpchalked up the decid-
ing extra point.

The Gridders, a tough outfit that
takes its name literally, defeated
an equally-rugged but not as
skillful Band team, 18-6. The Mu-
sicians had one consolation in de-
feat. -

Fenoglietto, who looks like the
original Mr. Five by»Five, got in
front of a Gridder pass on his
own goal line and outran every
man on the ﬁeld to tally on an 80-

‘yard dash. It was thelongest run

After a week of dry ﬁring, "can-
didates for the 1948 riﬂe team got
down to business in. earnest last
Monday.

The Panther’s first intercollegi-
ate riﬁe match will be in Janu-
ary, when they oppose squads
from the Universities of Alaba-
ma, George Tech, and Louisiana
State.

Coach Watts Shablowski, supply
room sergeant of the military sci-
ence department, is busy working
with and training, the largest
group of ROTC and Varsity hope-
fuls in Pitt’ history. They are firing
at the Pitt Stadium riﬂe range.

“While the University hopes to
schedule shoulder - to — shoulder
matches with district rivals,”
Shablowski revealed, “most of the
matches thistyear will be ﬁred via
the certiﬁcation system.”

Under this system, matches are
ﬁred at the home ranges of each
of the competing teams, : under
standard rules and procedures.
The results are certiﬁed and ex-
changed by mail. Any number of
schools can participate in the same
match and their relative standings
determined by mail. '

All positions on the 1948 teams
are still open. Candidates should
report to Sergeant Shablowski. at
the Stadium range between 1:00
and 4:30 p. m., Monday through
Friday. Membership in the ROTC
is not necessary, when trying out

, for the Varsity team.

rived in his unit, as he shipped

Since the theme of the meeting
was a get—acquainted one, the rou-
tine business of reports was ﬁrst
handled by the president, Corinne
Nelan.

Miss Nelan revealed a change in
WSGA policy regarding the publi-
cation of the “Vade Mecum,” of-
ﬁcial handbook for women stu-
dents. Editor of the book is now
appointed in the fall of the year,
rather than during the spring, as
has been the case in the past.

Printing Delay Eliminated
This change is expected to elimi-
nate the delay in printing which
occurred because the Vade Mecum
staff could not begin work until
the summer months. Beginning
this year, the editor will compile
the book during the year. Peggy
Evans, editor of the 1947-48 Vade
Mecum, has been appointed head

of the handbook staff, 1948-49.

Cecile Bruder, vice-president
and "WSGA head of‘ Freshman
Council, reported that the yet-to-
be-organized Council begins work
at the termination of the Cus-
toms period.

Budget Approved
Members of the commission ap-
proved the proposed budget, pre-
sented by WSGA treasurer, Pat
Seger. The budget becomes effec-
tive immediately.
Mary Jane Mitchell Page, Chief
Justice of Senior Court, told of
“the mere three signatures afﬁxed
to the sign-up sheet for Fireside
Chats with the chancellor, Rufus
H. Fitzgerald.,Mrs. Page encour-
aged members of commission to
attend these chats.
Since this was a get-acquainted
meeting, the faculty point of view
 was expressed by Mrs. Harriett G.
Kohberger. The policy which jus-
tiﬁes faculty participation and
counsel in WSGA activities was
stressed by Mrs. Kohberger.

“In the short time the organiza-
