Law School Head Dismissed
ForFailingtoMeetUltimatum

Thomas M. Cooley II, dean of the University School

of Law has been relieved of‘ his duties for failure to ad-
here to an “ultimatum” to bring his wife and children to
Pittsburgh by September, 1963. Dean Cooley, who assumed
his position in 1958, was aware of Chancellor Litchfield’s
desire to have him move his family to this area, but it was
not stated as an ultimatum until the spring of last year.

Plamiing to comply with the
Chancellor's wishes, Dean Cooley
bought .a house and intended to
send, for his family at their home
in Waterford, Va. By September,
however, he rever% his de-

cision. “The school was in dan-.

gerous shape,” he said, adding
that there was “no real hope”
that the problems facing it would
be solved.

According to Dean Cooley, the
main handicaps facing the Law
School are library resources, sal-
aries, student aid, and space. “I
thought the Law School was get-
ting little from the University
administration he said. “We did
not have enough library space
and Law School salaries arenot
satisfactory. There is not enough
appropriation for library books.”
He declared that resources for
student aid have been “strik-
ingly inadequate from the begin-
nmg.’~

Because he could see no solu-
tions for these problems, Dean
Cooley did not move his family.
He was looking for an opportun-
ity to resign when contacted by
Vice-chancellor of the Professions
A. C. Van Dusen before the fall
trimester. who informed him that

the Chancellor had decided that
a new dean should be appointed.
The Chancellor requested that
Dean Cooley remain until a suc-
cessor is named, and Dean Cooley
offered to stay until June. He
has been offered a position on
the faculty after his term ex-
pires, but has not accepted .or
rejected the offer.

ceanography Established

Long - Range Program
Will Cross Dept. Lines
Like Space Research

BY NANCY FUCHS

The University is establishing. a long-range oceano- 
graphy program to operate on a large scale basis similar 

to its space research program. The project was termed

“one of the most ambitious programs in oceanography 
ever undertaken by an inland university” by David Halli- a

day, dean of the Division of Natural Sciences.

  
  

_Foundtion win enable the interdisciplinary project
to begin operation. The initial phase will be cen-

erickson as its head. The program will involve the

and the properties of ocean water.
The best sites for studying the earth’s crust are
along fractures (cracks) in the ocean bottom

closer to the earth’s surface. The University is.
considering locating an oceanography station along
such a trench in the Caribbean. “We hope to have
something by next summer,” Dr. I-Ialliday ex-
plained.

to learn«to- distinguish between animal sounds and
the sounds of submarines to detect possible dang-

is “vital to both scientiﬁc inquiry and national
security.”

one of which is a 40 foot steel-hulled ocean-going
. _- vessel on loan to the University. Plans are under-
Frederickson way to build one more than twice its size, and
according to Frederickson, “eventually small, submersible craft may
be designed by the University and constructed by local industry.”

Like the aero-space program the oceanography project will be
University-wide, involving all of the sciences and many engineering

Freshman Injured
In Hit —Run Accident

Ellen DuBois, a University freshman injured in a
hit-run accident on Fifth Ave. at Friday night’s pep rally,
will be released from Montefiore Hospital today and con-
siders herself lucky that she only suffered a chipped

ankle and a concussion.

Miss DuBois was only one of a number of University

students who followed the
Fifth Ave. during a pep rally
for Saturday’s Pitt-Navy football
game. Two other students, Joyce
Steinﬁeld and Mark Schwartz, re-
ceived slight injuries and were
treated and released from the
hospital.

Miss DuBois said, “The man
that hit us (Ernest Simmons, 38,
of 6906 Hartmans Lane, East
Liberty) denies that he even hit
us and that anyone was even
hurt. He crashed a red light be-
fore he got to us. He didn’t even
stop. I hear that he went around
the corner to a police station and
reported that there was a student
riot and that the students had
damaged his car.

“'I‘he thing‘ about all of this
was that the students weren't on
top of his car as all of the news-
papers and radio stations have
reported. They only got on the
car after they had seen that
5011190110 W38 hit.” she continued.

“During the rally .1 turned
around to watch another car. A
car hit me from behind and
knocked me out. The ﬁrst thing
I remember was hearing some.

one else bouncing off the car’s
bumper. I felt a terrible jar and
then my tongue went numb,”
Miss DuBois said. “He didn’t
even blow his horn,” she added.

At a hearing in Traffic Court
on Monday, Simmons was held
for trial and then released under
$1,000 bond, according to officer
Elmer Dayton. The trial will be
held anywhere from two weeks
to six months from now.

“I wish it hadn’t happened,”
Miss DuBois said. “I'll be going
to other Pitt rallies, though. Any
thing for Pitt.”

departments as well. In relating the two Halliday referred to the
ocean, which comprises 71 per cent of the earth’s surface, as hydro-
space. The Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences itself is inter-

disciplinary as Halliday pointed
out, and the early phase of the
study will be in the realm of geo-
physics and geochemistry.

Both programs are constructed
to encourage “spin-off” research
developments, materials, and in-
struments which will contribute
to the economic development of
the Pittsburgh area.

A distinguished professorship
in oceanography and graduate
fellowships for training future
oceanographers will be establish-
ed. Frederickson hopes to have
the professorship ﬁlled by next
September. Professors from Car-
negie Institute of Technology
will teach graduate courses in
oceanography in the spring un-

der which students can register
at either school and take courses
at the other.

Frederickson emphasized the
fact “that no other landlocked
institution has an oceanography
program on the scale that we
will have.” The University of
Michigan has a “very active pro-
gram,” according to Frederick-
son, but its emphasis is on limno-
logy, the study of fresh water
lakes.

In stressing the national im-
portance of the project, Chancel-
lor Litchﬁeld called attention to
the almost tripled investment in
oceanographic research by gov-

ernment, academic and private -

institutions since 1958. “It is ex-
pected to triple again by 1973.”

soiIFor President

After serious consideration of the political philosophies of the two candidates

 for the president of the United States, The Pitt News strongly endorses Lyndon B.
B‘ Johnson and his running mate Hubert Humphrey.

We did not reach this decision on campaign propaganda, for the 1964 election
has been one of the greatest debunking of personalities our generation has seen -
the Democratic candidate by his Republican opposition, the Republican candiate by his

‘ own party’s literature and his own quotes thrown back in his face.

We cannot believe that a man of Senator Goldwater’s stature could achieve the

I I Republican candidacy if he were as ludicrous a ﬁgure as some purport him to be.
-The man is a senator with a strong political background and a popular support not

only of the little ladies from Finnleyville, Ohio, who turn out leaﬂets on Bobby Ken-
nedy’s affair with Marilyn Monroe but of an intellectual, respected segment of the

A nation who believe in his conservatism.

Nor wi'th any good faith can we accept the Bobby Baker scandal as indicative
of J ohnson’s total political philosophy, for this man has proved his capabilities through

 his political career and his eleven months in the White House. These instances of
. _ smear are certainly not unusual for a political campaign, but unfortunately the vot-

ing public has seen these things before the candidates’ stands have been fully exam-

ined.

We must support President Johnson for his ideological views and his practical
applications of those stands, for his concept of the national government as being
there to give support to Americans who need it, equalizing opportunity in such areas
as education and civil rights, not to‘ force any individual into a super-equal position
but simply to give him the chance to be what he can be through his personal ability.
We must support. him for his rational viewof foreign affairs and his acceptance of
the need for a peaceful co-existence.

This is a year of a precious opportunity for those students who can vote and
who will do so, we would hope, with a serious eye towards the issues involved.

The Pitt News believes that voting students, Weighing all the issues in their

White House.

v minds, will ﬁnd no other choice but to give Lyndon B. Johnson a full term in the

Republican Defeat Predicted

If one assumes that on

, Tuesday the American peo-

ple will decisively reject the
Goldwater - Miller ticket
(and by every indicatior
such an assumption seems
warranted), one instinctive-
ly asks the question—what

' is the future of the Repub-

lican party.
A landslide
victory for

Johnson and
Hubert Hum-
phrey will be
interpreted
by the moder-
ate wing of
t h e Republi-

SCHLOSSER can party as
being a clear repudiation of
ultra-conservatism and bel-
ligerant anti - communism.
These moderates, as they
begin the tedious process of
reconstruction, will immedi-
ately be confronted with a
series of unavoidable prob-
lems.

First, the progressive
elements will have to regain
some modicum of influence
over what is now a Gold-
water-controlled party ma-
chinery. Secondly, they will
have to select one political
personality around whom all
Republicans can coalesce.
and ﬁnally, the party will
have to develop a philoso-
phy which wi'll simultane-
ousy be applicable to con-
temporary problems and
palatable to the GOP right-
wing.

IN ADDITION TO con-
siderations of control, lead-
ership, and philosophy, Re-
publicans can only hope that
the zealots of the Right will
not abandon the party. Giv-

these ultra-conservatives, it
is entirely possible that the
right-Wing will formally dis-
associate itself from the
Grand Old Party (i.e., the
establishment of a third-
party, similar to the Con-
servative Party of New
York). Indeed if Barry
Goldwater could be persuad-
ed to lead a national con-
servative party, his most ar-
dent supporters, the “true
believers,” would most cer-
tainly accept his decision.
In Tuesday’s general
election, therefore, the
American voter has a dual
responsibility: First, he

must elect a president and‘

a vice-presi'dent; and sec-
only, he must consider the
future of progressive Re-
publicanism.

In independent circles
James Reston’s argument in
favor of ticket-splitting has
prevailed. Briefly stated,
the New York Times column-
ist urges Americans to take
a benign attitude toward the
candidaciesj_ of such men as

 

Hugh Scott and Kenneth
Keating, and then advises us
to cast a compassionate vote
for these two Republicans
in their bid for re-election.
The central premise of the
Reston thesis is, of course,
that re-election of Senator
Scott is essential to the fu-
ture of responsible Repub-
licanism. It is the opinion
of this columnist, however,
that their defeat would bet-
ter achieve Reston’s goal of
revitalization.

HUGH SCOTT and Ken-
neth Keating are as guilty
of lethargy and indecision
as are the Scrantons and
the Romneys and the Eisen-
howers in permitting the
reactionaries to seize con-
trol of the party apparatus.
Furthermore these senators,
if re-elected, would play no
real leadership role in Re-
publican affairs. Their de-
feat would become a lasting
landmark to the absurd (and
perhaps suicidal) nomina-
tion of Barry Goldwater.

‘News’ Praised

By Alumnus
Editor, The Pitt News:

I've had an opportunity to look
at The Pitt News on one of infre-
quent occasions. .May I compli-
ment you and the staff on the pa-
per. The issue was your Wednes-
day, October 21, edition but I am
sure it is representative.

I couldn't help but compare it
to the News of my 1936-40 days
at Pitt. We had quite a few good
men and women in those days
and the years have seen many of
them make their journalistic

marks, But your technical excel- .

lence of your paper and the ﬁne
writing of your editorialists, of
Nancy Fuchs, Wayne Claeren,
and others will stand compari-
sion with the so-called “giants”
of the past.

It was my opportunity to work
on the News for several years
and then as a junior to get a
night-side job on the old Sun-
Telegraph. (My city editor, Alex
Zehner, had an attachment for
young hopefuls and was one of
the kindest and ﬁnest of the
Pittsburgh journalism fraternity.)
For some. years after graduation
I followed journalism and today
I still regard it with a critical
and interested eye.

Although I don’t qualify as an
"oldster” — I hope — I like to
see that the younger generation
of Pitt News staffers are doing a
ﬁne job and represent a real
promise for the future. It’s true
some jobs may be tougher to get
nowawadays, but there is usual-
ly room for quality.

Editor, The Pitt News:

In regard to the article, “Ad-
ventures of a Secretary,” we the
secretaries of a ﬂourishing de-
partment in the School of Educa-
tion of the University of Pitts-
burgh, would like like to retort.
Miss Fuchs indidicates the job
is not an easy one as she, “a
typical college student,” had be-
lieved. However, the examples
which she uses to illustrate her
discoverey make the job seem as

if, in reality, it is. easy. We do
encounter telephone mishaps and
typing errors which must be cor-
rected; however, these mishaps
are a minor fragment of the dif-
ﬁiculties we encounter.

As an example of the fact that
“the other half” does indeed
possess intellectual faculties, I
refer to the following: In Sep-
tember, our department was
awarded a training grant for fel-
lowships to graduate students
training to become teachers of
exceptional children. This money
had to be set up in budget form
to allow for disbursement of stip-
ends, tuition, and other expenses,
such as salaries, equipment, etc.
This budget, which would es-
tablish a basis for remuneration
of monies by the accounting de-
partment and the U.S. Office of
Education, was set up completely
by a secretary.

Then there is the order of set-
ting up an appointment for 12
faculty members in diiferent di-
visions of the University, This re-
quires contacting each member
to be invited and ﬁnding out the
dates convenient to the individ-
ual, arriving at a date and time
agreeable to all. The process in-
volves elimination and requires
several telephone calls, calendar
checking and rechecking, and
some frustration on the part of
the secretary. However, we must
remain calm throughout and
carry on as well the "usual work-
day routine.

It might be added that the re-
ferral made to the secretaries as
“the other half” might be con-
strued as an insult as many of us
do attend night classes and are
working in order to obtain a de-
gree. We appreciate Miss Fuchs
attempt at rectifying the impres-
sion we make on the students,
but wish to emphasize that the
secretary’s job is .a little more
intricate than it appears to be
in her article.

Burke Urges Inter national

Understanding at Midday

By JOEL BEELER

“Education for What?”
was the question posed -—
“Education for internation-
al understanding” was the
answer of Dr. Albert Burk
at Friday’s Midday Lecture.
Dr. Burke, educator, author, and
economist, addressed a capacity
crowd at Stephen Foster Me-
morial.

In calling for international un-
derstanding Dr. Burke, who is
known for his Channel 13 tele-
vision program, “Probe,” stress-
ed three crucial needs which
American education should at-
tack: the need to be able to ade-
quately communicate with peo-
ple of other cultures; the need
to accept other people as equals,
and lastly, and perhaps most im-
portant, the need to understand
national defense in terms of in-
ternational communications and
understanding.

The essential problem, said
Burke, is that of communication:
“For the ﬁrst time Americans
must face the fact that they don’t
know what other people are talk-
ing about. The problem of what
we mean by the words we use
is the critical one.” This problem
is “critical internally, and fright-
ful externally.”

Statinx that “the range of stup-
idity and ignorance and genius
in every race is exactly the

same,” Burke argued that

the American educational system.

must teach us to deal with other
races “as though they are equal
human beings.”

The American educational sys-
tem, according to Burke, is pre-
senting a pre-World War II edu-
cation by teaching romance lan-
guages and European culture.
U.S. national. defense depends on
raw materials and these raw ma-
terials are no longer controlled

in Brussels or London, he ex-
plained. Instead, “our sources of
supply are sitting right in the
backyards of the 3,000 diﬂerent
language groups” of the emerg-
ing nations.

Burke called the Minerals year-
book of the United States the
most important book in our lives
today because it lists the 3,000
cultures and tells which ones
to know to procure the vital raw
materials necessary “to keep
this nation alive.”

As examples, Burke cited the
paralysis of Europe caused by
Nasser’s stoppage of its oil sup-
ply through the Suez Canal and
the -closing of a nickel and cobalt
plant in New Orleans resulting
from the lack of raw materials,
which were supposed to come
from Moa Bay, Cuba. ‘

The 3 p.m. coffee hour, usually
attended by approximately 20
students, attracted over a hun-
dred listeners,‘ who questioned
Burke about ‘his lecture and his
television show.

Mathiesen reported that three

4.1-

(See Editorial Page 4)

On most issues in the current presidential campaign,
the two contenders take completely opposite stands. Such
is the case where the ﬁnancing of higher education is con-
crned. The stands which President Johnson and Senator
Barry Goldwater have taken flow naturally from their

Goldwater Calls National
Control Unconstitutional

Senator Barry Goldwater’s position on education _is
in line with his general opposition to federal action in
what he calls ‘local affairs.” “Federal interventi‘on in edu-
cation,” he says, “is unconstitutional.” The quotation,_from
Conscience of a Conservative seems to be representative of
his philosophy, for he has voted against every program to
increase federal involvement in higher education for the
ten years.

Arguing that “federal aid to education inevitably means federal
control of education,” he voted last year against the ﬁve-year $1.2
billion “bricks and mortar” college construction bill and .also in
1963 opposed President Ker-inedy’s ﬁve billion dollar oirmibtw aid-to-
education bill and also in 1963 opposed President Kennedy’s ﬁve bil-
lion dollar omnibus aid-to-education bill, saying that the U.S. Office
of Education was “manufacturing” statistics and writing “propa-
ganda” to gain support for the bill. Both bills passed. Goldwater fur-
ther believes: "

“The function of our schools is not to educate, or elevate society,

. but rather to educate individuals and to equip them with the know-

ledge that will enable them to take care of society’s needs . . .”

Writing early this year about the goals of education, Goldwater
called for “the broadest possible opportunity for every individual,
in line with his talents; the highest possible quality, from elementary
grades to graduate school; and the greatest possible free choice.” But,
he continued, “federal aid is not the way” to reach these goals.

While Goldwater has opposed federal aid, he has argued that if
Congress does authorize it, it should be available to all schools, pub-
lic, private, and parochial.

He was also paired again the authorization of the 1963 exten-
sion of the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) and the Federal
Aid to Impacted Areas program. He voted against the $1.2 billion
college construction bill in 1963 and the amendemnt to extend the
1956 Library Services Act to urban areas, and against the amendment-
to authorize more money for federal grants to states to construct pub-
lic libraries.

This year he voted for the Revenue Act of 1964 which would
have allowed students to deduct from earned income, higher educa-
tional expenses such a tuition, books, fees, and so on with a maximum
deduction of $1,200 for undergraduate students and $1,500 for grad-
uate students.

Conflict: An Urban Portent,”

 

 CandidatesEducationalViews Discussed  

differing orientations towards the role of the federal
government in society. '

The Collegiate Press Service has compiled a report
of the major statements of the candidates and their
running-mates—Senator Hubert Humphrey and Repre-
sentative William Miller:

LB] Supports Federal Aid
As Part of War on Poverty

A President Lyndon Johnson has strongly favored fed-
eral aid to public education, and has championed a wide-
ranging array of legislative programs providing that aid.

Increased educational opportunities have been a major
—if not dominant——role in the President’s War on Pover-
ty, and in his other programs aimed at building “The

Great Society.”

Johnson, a former schoolteach-
er himself, said that he thinks
“the century in which we live
should henceforth be known as
the Century of the Educated
Man,” and he has shown little
hesitation in caning on the fed-
eral government to provide the
the money to make this possible
if state and local governments
are either unwiling or unable to.

As a Congressman and a Sena-
tor, Johnson voted for ﬁve of six
major federal aid to education
acts, including the $50 million
Permanent School Lunch Pro-
gram (1946), the $300 million Ed-
ucational Finance Act (1949), the
National Defense Education Act

(1958).
The only “no” vote on his rec-

ord was against a proposal to in-
clude one billion dollars for
school construction in the Na-
tional Defense Education Act of
1958, but he favored a srriilar
program in 1960.

The Johnson Administration»

tacitly opposed a plan which
would have permitted parents to
deduct from their income taxes
a certain amount of the expenses
incurred by dependents in col-
lege on the grounds that the tax
credit plan would aid most those
who needed it fl-east, i.e. those in
the higher income brackets.
The program was killed in the
Senate during the last session.
Johnson’s general approach to
education in general and higher

to work towards making it as
universal as possible. He views
the present progress in education
as “a revolution changing the
capabilities of the common man-—
changing what he is, what he can
be, and what his children after
him will be.”

In these last two areas the ad-
ministration has been particular-
ly active. It has asked for-and
received — from Congress bills
giving aid to medical schools,
providing‘ educational assistance
for the blind, deaf and handi-
capped. and extending ﬁnancial
assistance to the children of dis-
abled veterans.

The President’s anti - poverty
bill — The Economic Opportun-
ity Act of 1964 -— is said to pro-
vide adult basic education pro-
grams designed to meet the illit.
eracy problems of over 11.5 mil.
lion persons.

"_ﬁ§"JANE GOULD
The most prevalent fal-
lacy committed by social sci-
entists is unsubstantiated
generalization from the spe-
cific. This is especially dan-
gerous when the subject of
study is as highly complex
and individualistic as the
human personality. The
risks involved in attempting
to categorize personalities
usually produce pigeon-
holes either so constructive
as to exclude meaningful
traits, or so general to render
valueless the categorizations.

    

Dr. Roy Heath, the highly re-
spected ex-Director of the Uni-
versity’s Counseling Center, de-
voted his talents and energies to
a concentrated study of student
personality growth at Princeton.
His recently-published book, The
Reasonable Adventurer (Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Press, $1, 163
pages), summarizes, explains and
attempts to interpretthis study.
The book has become a virtual
best-seller for the University
Press, with several thousand
copies having been sold. It also is
being used as a text in Psychol-
ogy 124.

From his oﬁicial position as
adviser to 36 incoming freshmen,
Dr. Heath probed the depths of
their varied personalities, and
“discovered” four deﬁnite per-
sonality types.

There is the Non-Committer,
who principal drive seems to be
to avoid involvements, thereby
denying himself any sort of crea-
tive or individualistic actions.

The Hustlers, driven by a fren-
etic desire for recognition and
success, strive to exel at any cost;
their self-explanation is in ration-
al, idealistic terms, which do not

‘The Reasonable "  
Adventurer’

touch their innermost sensitiv-

ities. While the Non-Committer _

denies his inner needs, the Hust-
ler counters them with a ration-
al, purposeful existence.

The Plungers, the third proto-
type, are characterized as highly
emotional individuals, whose ac-
tions are determined solely by
mood. They are honest in their
self-expression, yet the picture
of a Plunger is confounded by
the divergence of selves which
comprise his total personality.

The_ ﬁnal type, which became
Dr. He.ath’s model of self-realiza-
tions, is the Reasonable Adven-
turer. It is this student, who al-
ternates detachement, with in-
volvement, who searches inde-
pendently and functions interper-
sonally, whom Dr. Heath sees as
having attained maturity. He has
not solved all his problems, and
never will; but he has .come to
terms with himself and his own
place in the world, and is thus
capable of, and willing to, face
the complexities of life.

These types are probably as
valid generalizations as can be
drawn. Yet one tends to wonder
how successfully these four char-
acterizations can be applied, par-
ticulary to the complex individ-
ual. During his life, such an in-
dividual zmight tend to fit several

of the four characterizations as
he matures.

A reading of The Reasonable
Adventurer also leaves another,
more important question, unan-
swered: Assuming that most stu-
dents can be successfully “pigeon-
ho1ed,” how could any institution
provide the wealth of trained per-
sonnel needed to analyze each
student so thoroughly as Dr.
Heath did with his 36? In an
age of depersonalization, how
could a college or university
modify its educational patterns,
as Dr. Heath advocates, to com-
pletely satisfy the divergent
needs of those—or any other-
typing of individuals. -

The Reasonable Adventurer is
a fascinating study-in-depth of 36
personalities. It tantalizes the
reader with character types which

are conceivable. Yet it leaves un-
described almost all the practical
lessons which should be learned
from such a characterization.

From 36 lives, Dr. Heath gen-
eralizes four major types. But
can these four types be used as
generalizations and be meaning-
ful beyond the cases which in-
spired them? One would hope so.
But Dr. Heath fails to tell us
how.

Quits Over Fight
With Chancellor

(Continued from Page 1.)

Although no eﬁort was made
to suppress this information, Dean
Cooley’s dismissal was not gen-
erally known until last Friday.
That evening, at the annual ban-
quet for the law school alumni,
Dean Cooley publicly informed
the guests of the development.
The local newspapers and radio
stations gave the story extensive
coverage.

When Dean Cooley assumed
his duties in 1958, the Univer-
sity’s School of Law ranked last
among Pennsylvania schools in
percentage of students passing
the Bar Exam. From 1960 until

this year, the University has led ’

all other Pennsylvania schools
three out of ﬁve times; its per-
centage -of students passing the
Bar Exam on the ﬁrst attempt
has never fallen below 80 per
cent, contrasted with 29.1 per
cent in 1958,

2. Right. And this year we have
:1 big decision to make —who
gets our vote for President.

I’ve already decided
to vote for the candidate
of my choice.

 

4. Then how do you expect to go
out into the world, support a
wife, raise children, and be :1
two-car family?

I wish I knew.

6. Soon as you get a job, put

some dough into cash-value
insurance, the kind they call
Living Insurance at Equitable.
It gives your wifeand kids

solid protection and it
automatically builds a cash
value you can use instead for
retirement or whatever you like.

Say, why don't you run
for President?

LET US GIVE THANKS

THEY SAY YOU should be thankful for little things. So
let's be thankful the Panthers have to play Syracuse only

once this season. Win or lose, Saturday will be the
Panthers’ roughest game of the season, thus far.

The Orangemen, now 4-2, will be hungry when
they meet the Panthers this Saturday at Archbold
Stadium. They were just upset by Oregon State,
31-13.

The University of Kansas football team was in
a similar situation when they met Syracuse after the
Orangemen had lost their opener to Boston College,
28-14. The Orangemen came back to topple the Jay-
hawks.

AOTHER ILL OMEN for the Panthers is Syracuse’s per-
formance against UCLA, their only common opponent.

The Panthers lost to UCLA, 17-12. The Orangemen
made the then undefeated Bruins seem like blocking
dummies, holding them to minus rushing yardage in
their 39-0 victory.

The Orangemen have an offense so explosive
that Archbold Stadium might smoke on Saturday.
They average better than 21 points per game. And
they have three of the best running backs in the East
in quarterback Wally Mahle, halfback Floyd Little,
and Fullbach Jim Nance.

The three have already rushed for over 1100
yards, averaging about ﬁve yards per carry.

TG DEFEAT SYRACUSE, the Panthers will have to
contain these rushers. Syracuse probably won't do much

passing, so the Panthers’ defensive backfield should
have a sort of breather.

If Syracuse is going to try to run up a score
against Pitt, and they will if they get the chance, it
will be on the ground, not through the air. Regular
quarterback Mahle only completes about four passes
a game.

Syracuse will try to beat Pitt by grinding it out.
They'll probably try to run the tackles against Pitt.
Everyone else does. If Syracus can score early, they'll
probably score often, too often.

P’ SYRACUSE ALSO HAS_ a strong defensive backfield.

Only one pass out of every three attempted against their

secondary is completed. UCLA quarterback Larry
Zeno, who looked so great at Pitt Stadium, completed
only four passes out of 20 for around 40 yards against
syracuse, and was held to minus yardage rushing.
Against Pitt he completed 12 passes out of 20 for

108 yards and rushed for 103 yards.
Syracuse has a superior football team. They
have the best team in the East. Be thankful we only

have to play them once.

SYRACUSE HAS A team far superior of the Panthers.
But the Panthers will be ﬁred up. They want this one.
Syracuse wants it more, 22-20. We like the Orange-

men, 22-20.

3! HLL CABIN
When the soccer team
plays the University of
Maryland this Saturday at
1:30 p.m. at Forbes Field,
they will be facing one of

the top teams in collegiate
SOCCEP.

In the last ﬁve years, the Ter-
rapins have competed in the
NCAA playoffs four times, losing
in the semi-ﬁnals last year to
St. Louis University, who won
the championship. The Terrapins
have dominated the Atlantic
Coast Conference during this per-
iod, compiling a 42-0-2 record.

“They’re a top team,” said
coach Leo Bemis, “and we will
be the underdog.”

Maryland has only three re-
turning lettermen, one of them is
All-America center-forward Eb-
erhard Klein, who scored 23 goals
last year. Klein, a. native of Stutt-
gart, Germany, has already scored
six goals this year, as the Terps
have compiled a 2-1 mark to
date.

“This year's offense is more
rounded,” said Maryland coach

7 Doyle Royal. “We have ﬁve men

on the line who can score, while
last year we relied on two.”

The Panthers also possess a
more balanced offense than last
year, when they lost to Mary-
Land, 2-0. “Our offense is well
distributed among our linemen,”
said Bemis. Every linemen has
scored at least one goal, as line-
men have accounted for 20 of the
booters 21 goals.

After their loss to Grove City
last Friday, the booters have a
4-2 mark, and a win or tie with
Maryland would provide key Say-
lor points. “Maryland will prob-
ably be an ‘A’ team,” said Be-
mis, “and if we can beat them,
we’ll be in good shape.” If Mary-
land ends the season as an “A”
team, the booters will get 300
points for a win and 200 for a
tie.

 Skiers Cancel

First Outing

The Ski Club‘s trip to the Blue
Knob ski slopes scheduled for

V October 31 has -‘been canceled.

The club will hold a meeting
on November 10 at 7:30 p.m. in
parlors A, B, and C of the Stu-
dent Union. At the meeting, Dr.

a ski ﬁlm will be shown. Future
outings and special events will
also be discussed at this session.

F rosh Coach
To Cut Squad

The turnout of 30 candidates
for the freshman basketball team
has given coach Carl Peterson a
big problem. He must cut 21 of
the 30 frosh prospects by this
Friday.

Starting next Monday, these
nine plus four freshmen on schol-
arships, will begin practice for
the season opener on December

Timmons Searching
For Five Top Men

The basketball team has
started scrimmaging at the
Fitzgerald Field House.
Coach Bob Timmons has
been running the team thru
practice games in an effort
eﬂfort to determine his starting
ﬁve.

Timmons is seeking replace-
ments for last year’s starting
team of Paul Krieger, Brian Gen-
eralovich, Cal Sheffield, Dave
Sauer, and Dave Roman. Retum-
ing l.ettermen are center Bob
Lovett, guard Larry Szykowny,
and forward Daryle Ruby.

Lovett, who was Krieger’s sub-
stitute last year, seems the prob-
able starting center. Jim LaVal-
ley, a 6’7” sophomore, will be
Lovett’s top competitor, LaVa1ley
has been sick, and has missed
much practice.

Dave Blyshak and Tom Roan-
tree, who started on the junior
varsity last year, will be vying
with Ruby for the forward spots.
Senior Brian Fisher, sophomore

Stan Falenski, and Szykowny are

  

the top candidates at guard. Fal-

enski was the top scorer on last
year’s freshman team.

Mazurek Joins Team
In Making Mistakes
On Football Field

By FRANK SMIZIK

The Panther football team has had two ties in a row
and has a 2-2-2 record. Through the whole season mis-
takes have cost the Panthers football games and these
mistakes have not been made by sophomores alone.

‘The most noticeable player on the field i's the quarter-
back and it is he that usually gets the brunt of the criti-

cism. Panther quarterback Fred
Mazurek has had two sub-par
games in a row and the fans and
the students are starting to won-
der if it's the same All-America
candidate from last year.

Several factors have hurt Ma-
zurke this season. one is the lack
of a, strong experienced line to
open up the holes and to zive
him the passing protection. He
also seems to be pressing and
passing before he has to. Several
times in the Miami game Ma-
zurek had time but couldn't spot
his receivers and started to run.

In the Navy game halfback
Eric Crabtree was clear several
times but Mazurek underthrew
him or didn’t spot him and threw
to the end. In the Navy game he
also threw an underhand pass
while being tackled which was
intercepted. However, he did run
the team well in the ﬁrst quar-
ter alternating hand-oﬁs to Barry
McKnight and Crabtree.

Although Mazurek has had two
sub-par games, Michelosen isn't
giving up on him. “Mazurek is

still the best we have and I have
to go along with him,” he said.

“Ken Lucas is the better pass-
er, but who is going to catch his
passes?” Evidently Michelosen
feels his receivers aren't the best
he has had here.

It would be silly to put the
brunt of the failure on Mazurek.
The inexperience at tackle has
cost Pitt a couple of games also.
The loss of Ron Linaburg, Bill
Howley, Bill Bodle, and John
Verkleeren were also costly.

The game against Navy was
also a day for the second guess-
ers. Twice the Panthers had ‘the
ball with fourth down and short
yardage and Michelosen chose to
go for the long ﬁeld goals and
both were missed.

“At the time I thought it was
a good idea because Jimmy had
been kicking pretty wen in prac-
tice and it was a straight on
kick. Of course, if I had the ad-
vantage of the second guess I
wouldn’t have decided on the
ﬁeld goal attempt,” Michelosen
said. ‘

Freshman Football Team Jelled
In Final Game of Short Season

It took the freshmen foot-
players two and a half
games to realize that their
days as individual stars had
passed and that their days
as team stars were just be-
ginning, according to coach Bill
Kaliden.

Going into the closing half of
the Penn State game, the Cubs
were trailing, 18-0. By the close
of the game they had narrowed
the score to 18-12, and only an
oﬁsides penalty deprived them of
a possible chance of winning.

“They grew into a football in
that second half,” said coach Bill
Kaliden. “Something happened
during half time, for when they

 

came back onto that ﬁeld they
realized they weren’t playing as
individuals from high school any-
more. It was only too bad they
had to wait so long to ﬁnd out.”

The Cubs ﬁnished their short
season with a 1-2 record. Their
win came over West Virginia, 8-7.
In all their games, they outdis-
tanced their opponents in the air
but feel far behind on the ground.

For the three games, the frosh
gained 451 yards passing to their
opponents 290. Mike Elliott com-
pleted 15 of 28 attempts for 206
yards and Bob Bazylak connected
on 17 of 37 attempts for 207
yards.

Bob Longo, who pulled in 11-.

passes for .148 yards and two

 

touchdowns, was the leading re-
ceiver.

In the rushing department, the
Cubs amassed 358 yards their op-
ponents’ 527. Elliott was the lead-
ing ground gainer with 102 yards.

“Each game threw a different
light on a new player,” said Kali-
den. “Every week it was some-,
body elses turn to show he had
some ability. A lot of these boys
will be playing next year.” "

Despite the fact that their
scheduled season is over, the
Cubs will be scrimmaging with
the varsity for another month.
Said Longo, “It makes it rough
on us practicing with nothing to

look forward to, but there's al-e 

ways,  year}?

Damien Koh Star

By BILL CABIN

Although Damien Koch
had no intention of joining
the cross-country team when
he came here in 1962, he is
now the team’s number two
runner.

“I \didn’t want to endanger my
grades,” said Koch, who is a
math major with a 3.1 average,
“so I had no intention of running
in my freshman year. After my
frosh year, however, I felt I
needed a diversion from school,
and went out for the cross-coun-
try team.

Koch, a junior from Pittsburgh’s
Oakland district, had no experi-
ence in competitive athletics un-
til his senior year at Central
Catholic High School. “My father
didn’t want me to compete in
athletics, but in my senior year
I realized what I was missing,
and started participating in in-
tramural sports.

“By that time, it was too late
to develop any skills in football,
basketball, or baseball, so I join-
ed the cross-country team.” Koch
lettered that year as a member
of Central’s undefeated cross-
country and track teams.

Despite his lack of experience,
Koch lettered on the cross-coun-
try team last year. Coach Jim
Banner admits, “Koch is the sec-
ond top runner on the team,” and
yet he does not have a scholar-
ship. “I don’t -run for a scholar-
ship,” said Koch. “I run because
I enjoy the sport, and there’s no
other reason.”

Koch attributes the cross-coun-
try team’s success to the coach-
ing of Jim Banner. “We’ve got
essentially .-the same team as last
year,” said Koch. “Steve Waslo
and Larry Robinson were the
only seniors to graduate, and
they were replaced by sopho-
mores Frank Handleman, Fran
Shor, and Larry Hubner, who are

  

 

DAMIEN KOCH
No. 2 Runner

“Coach Banner has made the
difference in this year's team. He

communicates well with the team,
and has a good knowledge of the
spo .”

Koch cited Banner’s training

, procedure as an example of his

knowledge of the sport. “Last
year we only ran seven to eight
miles daily in practice,” he said,

For Harriers

“whﬂe coach Banner has us run-
ning 14 and 15 miles now.

“Although it’s a harder work-
out, it doesn’t feel that much
harder because he varies his
workouts and makes you enjoy
running. He’s really a great guy,
and gets along with the runners
because he knows how it feels to
run.” Banner gained his running
experience as a hurdler here.

With the harriers now ‘5-(),
Koch feels that overconﬁdence
will not hinder their chances
against West Virginia this Satur-
day. “They’ve got two good run-
ners and will probably be up
for us, but we’ll be ready for
them. Coach Banner doesn’t let
us slack, and we’re up for the
meet.”

Koch is also optimistic about
the IC4A which will be held No-
vember 16 in New York. “The
whole team is going,” said Koch,
“and I think we can win it. We’ve
got a balanced team, which is a

key factor in winning a meet.”

 
    

Harrier Team

Meets WVU

The cross-country team tr.avels

to Morgantown, West Virginia,»

this coming Saturday for a meet
with the Mountaineers of West
Virginia University. The Moun-
taineers have yet to win a cross-
country meet, and should be easy
prey for Jim Banner’s cinder-

men, who are led by senior John ~

Bailey and junior Damien Koch.’

A victory over West Virginia
would give the cross- country
team its first undefeated season
in many years.

America’s automobile industry is in the midst of a challenging era, with pros-
pects of an even more exciting and demanding tempo in the years to come.
Ford Motor Company is determined to achieve leadership in all phases of its
operation. This leadership promises to bring lasting success to the company, its
employes and its stockholders. _
It will take people to accomplish this objective.
marketing, product planning, sales—all require people with the knowledge,
judgment and personal drive to avail themselves of the unprecedented oppor-
tunities offered by a great industry.
The automobile business is growing. More cars are being bought now than ever
before. With increases in population and consumer buying power, even more
will be bought in the future. Realizing this, Ford Motor Company seeks to
attract college graduates who have the capacity to grow with the company
and the market.
“Right now, our plans call for employing about a thousand of the best 1965
graduates we can ﬁnd, with all types of educational backgrounds. We need
specialists, but we also need persons with broad liberal-arts training who can
handle a wide variety of assignments. Actually, in our company, many gradu-
ates grow into jobs totally unrelated to their degrees. They have discovered
that Ford offers intellectually challenging opportunities for those with the
ability to seize them. We invite you to make the same discovery.
Contact your Placement Oﬂice and arrange to see our representative.
