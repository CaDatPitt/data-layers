Lions-’2nd Half

BY RON SIEGEL \
SPORTS EDITO/R

State College, Pa.---In a contest
in which halftime seemed to end
one game and start another, Penn
rallied to defeat upset-
minded Pitt Saturday, 35-13.

The first half was all Pitt. A
14-yard tou_chdown run by Tony
Dorsett and two ﬁeld goals by
Carson Long gave Pitt a 13-3 lead.

Long's second field goal, a
50-yarder with no time left on the
clock, was greeted by the Pitt
squad as if it had won the game.
The entire team mobbed Long
instead of going directly to the

' locker room. .

Pitt did not score in the second
half, but Penn State put 32 .points

-_ on the board, and Pitt won't get

half a victory because it was

leading at halftime.

Penn State took the opening.

kickoff and marched down to the
Pitt 26. where a Chris'Bahr field
goal attempt was no good. ‘The
drive wasilead by Heisman Trophy
candidate John Cappelletti, who

ﬁnished the "day with 161 yards ‘

rushing.

Pitt did not sustain a drive, and
'-was forced to punt. Qn Penn
State’s ‘second play of the series,
quarterback Tom.Schuman threw a
pass which Panther defensive end
Jim Buckmon batted down with one
hand, then amazingly grabbed the
ball while it was still in the air for
an interception. Buckmon set off
on a 33-yard‘ return to the Penn
State 13, which ended in a fumble,
recovered by -PSU guard Mark
Markovich.

After‘ two first downs, Brian
Massela came in to punt, and his
34-yarder was fumbled by fresh-
man Robert Haygood and recover-

ed by Penn State’s Jim Bradley. ‘

The Pitt defense dug in, and
Bahr was called on to kick a_ ﬁeld
goal, which this time was good,
putting Penn State ahead,'3-O.

Neither team mounted a drive as
the ﬁrst quarter ended. After
repeated exchanges of the football,
a Massella punt went just 23 yards,
to the Penn State 38. Pitt's offense
moved the ball in for a touchdown
in ﬁve plays.

Faced with a third-and-ten at the
38. quarterback Billy Daniels
couldn't ﬁnd a receiver, so he ran
13 yards for a ﬁrst down. He hit
Bruce Murphy for 11 yards and a
ﬁrst down on the next play, then
Tony Dorsett took the ball in from
14 yards out.

Dorsett, who was held to 77
yards rushing, raced around left

'  end,’ busting a tackleat the line of
Scrimmage and dragging .a de-

‘A

fender in with him from the three.

Penn State, set in the hole by
excellent Pitt kick-off coverage,
was forced to punt. A A great

pass-run play by Murphy, which Q

covered 43 yards, and a ten-yard
run by Bill Englert set the stage for
a 31-yard ﬁeld goal by_Long.
Penn State had to start from its
10 due to the kick_coverage, and
again was forced to punt. A pass to
Murphy and a 10-yard run by
Dorsett got the ball to the Nittany

Lion 33, where with time running"

out, Long bootedrhis'50-yarder on
third down. V A /'

Pitt received the second half
kick-off, but despite a penalty
which had him kicking from the 35,
John Reihener booted the ball into

the endzone, where Haygood took‘

the ball out to the 10:

The Penn State defense became
unyielding, and Pitt ﬁnished the
third quarter with minus 15’ yards
total offense. Penn State’s offense
starting to jell, aided _‘by a
questionable call by_ the official,
which Pitt Head Coach Johnny
Majors said was the turning point
of the game.

With’ a third-and-goal from the
Pitt six, Schuman dropped way
back to pass. With Buckmon ready
to drag him down, Schuman
unloaded a ﬂimsy pass which
landed near PSU guard Charlie
Getty, an ineligiblereceiver. Every
eligible receiver was in the
endzone, 23 yards from Getty.

Intentional Grounding was not
called, but defensive holding in the

. endzone was, giving Penn State its

second ﬁrst-and-goal at ‘the one.
After being unable to score the ﬁrst
two tries, fullback Bob Nagle made
it across for the touchdown. It was
Penn State's seventh attempt from
inside the six. 

“I asked the official after the
game why he didn’t throw his
flag,” said Majors. “He said he
saw an eligible receiver. I don’t
have super vision, but I didn’t see
any eligible receivers.” ’

Penn State head coach Joe
Paternosaid the rule states that the
pass must be near any player, not
an eligible receiver, which is
clearly different than ‘what the
ofﬁcial told‘Majors. ,

Taking ‘over from its 20, Pitt
could not move the ball, and
Daniels was tackled for big losses
twice. Larry Swider, who had a
good day. pulnting for a 41.7,
average, got off a 48-yarder. which
gave the Lions a first down at
midﬁeld. '

Penn State marched .downfield in

ten plays’, scoring soon after the
fourth quarter began. Paterno had

_ gambled fora two-‘point: conversion

_desire,.

on the first touchdown, and
succeeded. This time he went for
one, and the score was 18-13, Penn
State. U ’ '1

Pitt ran into’ more difﬁculty
quickly. With heavy pressure by
the Lion defense, Daniels threw a
pass which was intercepted, by
linebacker Tom Hull and returned
for a touchdown. Bahr’s extra
point made it 25-13.

Pitt culd not move the ball again,
and the Penn State offense
marched 64 yards for a TD, the
six-pointer comingaon a 32-yard
Schuman pass to Chuck Herd.

,Another Daniels” pass was
picked off, this’ one by Chris Devln,
and although the offense was
stymied, Bahr came on to kickua

field goal, which gave the Lions a , '

35-13 lead, the final score.

Pitt came close to scoring, aided
by consecutive pass interference
calls and a 17-yard burst up the

Crap Coach Adams

BY VINCE DINARDO I
As people go, Dave Adams is a.

‘Good Joe’. .He likes to laugh, sip '

on a can of beer occasionally, and,
why he even tells ‘good’ jokes.

He’s a proud family man and
judging from his friendly wagers,
you get the impression that when
there's a sports program on
television, Adams will be watching.

As Pitt wrestling coach, though,
you might think Dave is some kind
of a nut.

With 35 wrestlers returning this
year, only three of which are
seniors, Adams .went out and
scheduled one of the best--if not

‘the best--wrestling teams in the

country (Oregon. State) TWICE!
Not only that. but he scheduled
third ranked Michigan, sixth
ranked Oklahoma, Navy and Penn
State who are tied for the ninth
ranking, Michigan State (14th),’
Lehig‘h (18th). and the best college’
division wrestling team in the
universe--Clarion, ‘who would have
ranked fourth in last year's NCAA
tournament had it not been college
division. _

But really, Adams is not crazy.
He’s pretty shrewd.

Just the other day he was
schooling his young grapplers on

the .importance of being ready,
the post-season-,,

and
tournaments--the Easterns and t_he
National. -Champio-nsh'ips~.t In-A ._

I

JOHN CAPPELLETTI, Penn State7s Heisman -trophy candidate 

Dovvns-Cats 35-13

-tailback, rushed for 161 yards Saturday, including a touchdown run, to -

lead Penn State to a 35-13 victory over Pitt.

“We hope to win all our dual
meets,” he said, “but the
tournaments are the most impor-
tant.’~’

Adams is capable of giving spine
tingling dissertations on the
one-on-one competitive beauty of
college wrestling, he likes to paste
up signs in his practice room and
fits the billing of ‘Gipper’- to he hilt.
This year, he wants his wrestlers to
know they have wrestled the best
competition to be found.

Conﬁdently, he feels he has the
lads--that's one of his words-—to do
it and still possibly come out on
top. ‘ _ _

Since October 15, the wrestlers
have been going through a tough
conditioning program, as well as
brushing up on their skills and
manuvers.
December eight.

The way it looks now, Adams will

.be thin in the heavier classifac-

tions, getting stronger as the
weights go down.

“Our lighter weights
younger," he noted, “butwe have
more untapped quality and depth
there. Our other weights are pretty
strong, but the depth can't equal
that of our lightweights.

“The competition is pretty
__downright‘ keen right now,” he

added.” -' -“My i‘mp'r'e'ssi‘o'n' rs-*r'ea11'yf“‘

(Continued from Papgezo)

g With the defense keeping Pitt deep in its own territory, Patemo’s
squad had exceptional field postion most of the second stanza. The
, _ Statecoach had only to insert his two play offense and watch the‘
‘  second half repeat performance, as he has done so often. From Charlie
Pitman to Franco'Harris and Lydell Mitchell and now to Cappelletti,
the Penn State offense has been the same.
 Paterno merely sent a back in motion to draw the Pitt monster man to
the strong side and then send Cappelletti off tackle the other way. ,It
looks too elimentary to be exciting but it’s what Penn State fans are
accustomed to. Besides that, Paterno is the winningest, percentage
coach in the businessgv . ‘ . - -
The show was stolen by the Pitt defensive unit when they— held the.
Penn State offense on_ a half dozen attempts from inside the five yard
_ line. Paterno insisted on shoving the ball down the throats of the Pitt
defense but the Cappelletti slants, into the line were handled with class»
by the Panthers’ front line. _, A - 1
After Pitt was called for 12 men on the field, the Nittany Lions were
gifted with a fresh start. But the Pitt‘ defense backed their-\‘opponents .,
up, causing a Cappelletti fumble that rolled out of bounds _for a
-‘moderate loss. Then, when it seemed _that Penn State quarterback
‘Tom Shuman was about to be sacked» for a loss, he unloaded the ball to
a vacant spot on the field.  L a ~ ‘ _ ' '
Instead ‘of a flag thrownfor intentional grounding, Pitt was called for .
‘defensive holding on the other side- of the field. It’s not that the call '
was a homer; the infraction occured directly in front of the official, who
was paying no attention to the action in the backfield. ‘
__ V Still, the touchdown was notinimediately coming. The Pittdefenise
' 7 ,‘  showed ‘themselves during that stan'd, but it was that mom_en't_of_the
 ‘ game that themonientum of the game became ﬁrmlyestablished in-
Penn State’s possession. H — ’ ' , ' - M
The final score, 35313, had” to" stand as being inducative of what went
on during those four quar_ters. Unlike the defeat to Notre Dame, where ,
Pitt came out top statistically, Penn State’s second half heroics were __
enough to overshadow Pitt’s performance in’ the first. I
Cappelletti may not be cut fromthe moldﬂof -a classy- runner, and
