Panther Central didn’t have new .

IDs ready forﬂsome students and
faculty members yesterday.

The University had to preor—
der the majority of the more than
30,000 news IDs injune, Panther
Central manager Jessica Larson
said. So people who don’t have a
photo on ﬁle — transfer students
and new faculty members, for
example —— will have to wait in
line while Panther Central prints
new IDs for them.

Students and faculty members
who have photos onﬁlecan swap

Larson said she doesn’t know

to see Pittsburgh’s volunteer
organizations play a greater
role in the community. He
currently serves ‘as executive
director of Renew Pittsburgh,
an organization founded by
Ravenstahl’s predecessor,
the late Mayor Bob 0’Connor.
O’Connor’s goal was to revi-

burgh has the opportunities
to be more inclusive, and I’m
the only candidate to stand
up for gay rights and anti-
discrimination ordinances.”

1 -Separatingfromthetwo-
party system: Acklin said he
chose to run as an indepen-
dent candidate because he
didn’t want to be conﬁned to
the terms “Democrat” and
“Republican.”

“I’m a Pittsburgher and
wanted to ‘run as a Pittsbur-
gher,” he said. “This is my way
of giving back to our city that
has given me so much.” .

Random fact: Acklin
grew up on Parkview Avenue
in Oakland, across the street
from Hall of Fame quarter-
back and Pitt alumnus Dan
Marino. Acklin recalled hav-

lic High School. Oakland “was
my playground as a kid,” he
said.

Fighting against alcoholmisuse on campus

Chancellor Nordenberg receives $50,000 from nonproﬁt organization for alcohol education and programs at Universit

Lindsay Carroll
Assistant News Editor

Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg
received a $50,000 award yes-
terday for his work to “create an

environment where learning and
campus life are not undermined
by the misuse of alcohol.”

He was honored by The Gordie
Foundation at a ceremony at the
University Club. The Gordie Foun-
dation is a nonproﬁt organization
started by Leslie and Michael La;
nahan after their son, 18—year~old
University of Colorado freshman
Gordie Bailey, died of alcohol poi-
soning in 2004.

Bailey had been at college for
only three weeks.

Lanahan said in a news release
that school administrators can
signiﬁcantly reduce the amount of

— alcohol—related deaths on college
campuses. ’

“The highly effective campus
programs that Chancellor Nor-
denberg has set in place provide a
great foundation for other schools
to create their own plans of edu-

cating students about the dangers
of alcohol,” she said.

The foundation ‘praised Nor-
denberg for implementing poli-
cies and programs that decrease

in 2006.

alcohol use on campus.
The Universityinstituted sev-

eral new initiatives to curb student

alcohol use in 2006, according to
a news release from Pitt’s Division
of Student Affairs. For instance,
the University provided an alcohol
education program for students to
complete online, called the “Alco-
hol Wise Program.” Of this year’s

freshman class, 94 percent of stu-

dents completed the program, the
release said.

Pitt also began alcohol—speciﬁc
training for resident assistants,
freshman peer counselors with
University Admissions and First
Year Mentors with Student Life,
the release said.

It referenced the Late—Night
Mini—Grant program, which
awards funds to organizations
that hold late night and weekend
alcohol alternative programs, as
well as residence hall program-

ming and the creation of Nordy’s

Place.

Student surveys show that dur-
ing the past 18 to 24 months, 12
percent fewer Pitt students en-
gage in high risk or “binge” drink-
ing, Twenty percent fewer report
negative academic consequences
of alcohol use, 61 percent more
report receiving information from
the University on alcohol and 36
percent fewer students reported
driving after drinking.

The release did not give exact
numbers or state what past per-
centages were.

Mayoral election ‘09:
anyone but Ravenstahl

ithout P. Diddy marketinga
“Vote or Die” fashion line,
students might not remem-
ber election day. It’s the ﬁrst Tuesday
alter the ﬁrst Monday of November.
In other words: today. Assuming you
have already ﬁnished collecting your

_ autumn harvest, you should go out to

vote, especially if casting a ballot for
anyone other than Mayor Luke Ra-
venstahl. . '

Voting is important, but don’t
worry, this is not alesson in civic duty.
Students have so much diﬂicultyinvot—
ing—between re-registeringatanew
address and skipping class to vote -
that no guilt trip based on Madison’s

American vision will goad anyone to
the polls.

Rather, self-interest should drive
students to vote in this local election.
Therearemany potential consequenc-
es and beneﬁts for students. Many lo-
cal elections are taking place, and the
mayoral race promises to greatly-aﬂ‘ect
students (see proﬁles on Page 2).

’ Castingavote is not as inconvenient

highlytraiiickedareas likePosvarHall.
Try to get out of class by appealing to
your professors’ sense of electoral re-
sponsibility. If that doesn’t work, just

grab a coffee and get ready to shape
the ﬁiture.

Unlike national elections, yourvote S

will actually matter. Of course, every
vote counts, but a smaller electorate
turns out in local elections, making
each ballot cast much more inﬂuen-
A large student Voting bloc could

decide policy that directly applies to
student lives. That is why students
should vote against Ravenstahl.

voterapathyinthe college demograph-
ic because his policies hurt students.

Ravenstahl’s current tax proposal
includes a $50 fee on all college stu-
dents per semester. That adds up to
$400 for the average baccalaureate
degree and more if attending graduate
school. And don’t get the H1N1 virus
or alcohol poisoning, because Raven-
stahl proposed taxes on hospital bills,
as well.

Unlike national
elections, your vote will i
. actually matter.

So look at it like  Ifyou wait in

a voting line for 60 minutes and your ‘

ballotfor independent candidateKevin
Acklin or Franco “Dok” Harris helps
unseat Ravenstahl, you just made at
least $400 per hour. V

' Ravenstahl pulled out of a Pin: Stu-
dent Government Board-sponsored
mayoral debate while Acklin and Har-
risvalued student opinionby showing
up. Nick Trainer, SGB governmental
relations committee chairman, said

of a “busy schedule.”

Ravenstahlfeltthatone hourspent
talkingto studentswas too much. This
shows atrue disregardto the Pitt com-
munity. . .
His oﬂice has repeatedly ignored
inquiries from this newspaper about
consultantjohn Verbanac and G-20
Summit proceedings. He faces alle-
gations of corruption regarding Ver-
banac, and he has not reached out to
repair the city—college relationship in
the aftermath of police aggression at
the G—20. If that’s not enough, Raven-
stahlisusingarecycled Larrythecable
Guy catchphrase as his campaign slo-
gan: “Getting It Done.”

You have the chance to voteagainst
Ravenstahltwicebecause heisninning
asbotii the Democratic and Republican
candidate. This strategy allows catch-
ing extra votes from people pulling
straight—party ballots. It’s slimy.

Today, students canvote for some-
thingbetter. NeitherAcklin nor Harris
have emerged as awe-inspiring candi-
dates, buttheyol:"r'eranoppoi1unityfor
a fresh start with a more caring city
executive. A strong student constitu-
ency could prevent representatives
from drafling more punitive policies
targeting Oakland, such as increased
open-container ﬁnes and a ban on
porch couches.

A voting bloc like that could make
a positive impact. Students need the
city to crack down on slunilords and
to provide more accessible parkingfor
permit holders.

These possibilities can only hap-
pen if enough students participate in
the election today. Get it done. Get

Tuesdays with Molly
A ‘growing’ addiction

Molly Green
Columnist

Before one enters the digitized
gates of FarmVille know this: It is
not just a Facebook application,
but a drug, a depravity, a drain
that takes one’s time, energy and
— in some cases — money and
sucks it mercilessly away into its
cold heart, black like the color of
its pixilated sheep.

Over the past few weeks, I’ve
watched several friends spiral
downward into this bottomless
pit of inanity, down deeper than
the potatoes they spend so much‘
time harvesting. V

Two of these friends agreed to
share their stories. For privacy
reasons — and because their ad-
dictions are already socially hu-
miliating — they will simply be
known as “J” and “E.”

Welbegin our tale with], a hap-
py, enthusiastic girl who is quick

to laugh and entertains a variety L

of interests. Recently, however,_]
has been apportioning an increas-
ing amount of time to FarmVille.

“I am level 25. A local celebrity.
One ribbon away from a Good Sa-
maritan,”J told me as she loaded
her farm, which is favorited on
her Internet server.

“I’ve also earned all my rib-
bons in the -Green Thumb cat-
egory, as well as the Tree Hugger
category,” she added, almost as
an afterthought.

“It took a lot of perseverance.
It took a lot of time, too. You have
to take time out of your day to har-
vest your crops so that you don’t
waste your money.”

She tells me these things
matter—of-factly, as if she’d been
waiting all her life to proclaim her
FarmVille glory to the world.

FarmVille < 5

it became clear thatJ was still in
denial about her FarmVille addic-
tion. When I asked if it had ever
negatively affected her day-to-day
life, she turned on me, like a bitter
winter frost to a ﬁeld of helpless
tomato seedlings.

“I don’t want to talk negatively ‘

about it,” she said defensively, as
if she was a new mother and Farm-
Ville her precious infant. When
pressed further, she admitted it
was sometimes a distraction in
social situations.

“My friends will be hanging out
together in my room, and I’ll have
to tell them to hold on because I
need to harvest my crops.” J

The withdrawal from Farm-

: Ville only intensiﬁes whenJ goes

to class.

“When I’m,_in class, I always

feel this need to get home and har-

vest my crops beforethey wither ~

J said she plays the game
“probably every time I log onto
Facebook, which is quite a lot. If
[the application] shut down to-
day, I would be lost. I would be
so lost.”

Though FarmVille has clearly
hamperedJ’s day-to—day lifestyle,
she is one of the lucky few. She
still views FarmVille as what it is:
a distraction, a release from the
outside world.

E, however, is the worst kind
of FarmVille addict: the one that
wants to be, nay, must be, the
greatest farmer in all the land and
won’t stop until she has achieved
this near-impossible status.

farming systematically. It’s not
. just a game, but an algorithm to

be solved. .

E believes that sometimes de-
cisions must be made for the good
of the farm.

For example, a recent New
York Times article about Farm-
Ville quoted an anonymous blog—
ger who said she was pregnant: “I
was starving  and he told me I’d
have to wait a few more minutes

she really, and, more pressing,
how close were the raspberries
to maturity?”

Ever the thorough farmer, E
took the time to test this theory
out. '

“First of all, I did research on
this in response to the article. I
sacriﬁced a square of my farm to
plant raspberries and let them
die. And they took upward of
four hours to die, despite having

. “I’m a verycompetitive indi-
vidual. I saw this pagoda,” E said,
giggling mid—sentence, “that’s
worth 48 FarmVille dollars, and
I realized that I had to have it.
My little virtual farm would not
be complete without a pagoda.
That’s all.’..’ .

E is the type that plans her

sohe could HARVEST HIS RASP-
BERRIES! I waited... in the car and
waited for his stupid raspberries
to be harvested.”

While this might seem unjusti-
ﬁed, even cruel, to non-farmers,

berry farmer, “Two questions

Usually, plants wither in maybe 40
percent of the time it takes them
to grow. Perhaps he didn’t know
this information. He probably as-
sumed they were like other crops,
which they were not.”

Like J, E was hesitant to admit
just how much time she spends

on FarmVil1e, taking a long pause
before answering, “On my 400-
square plot, it can become a chore
to tend my crops, and so I stag-
ger my planting so that I will only
have to harvest about 40 crops
at a time. So maybe four times
a day.”

“Oh, what a lie!” cut in J, who

was sitting nearby, before the ’

two begin jabbering on about the
enormous amount of time it takes
to adopt animals.

E spoke passionately on the
civic importance of adopting ani-
mals on FarmVille.

J leaned over to tell me, “I,
-would like you to know that I just
left a message on a new farmer’s
farm that said, ‘Your farm is a
joke. Get plowing, b*tch.”’

I am left between the two,

. speechless and confused;

I fear it is too late to salvage the
once promising futures of E and
J, but for the rest of you, take this
as a warning and stay away — far
away — from FarmVille.

‘Dead Zone’ creeping with zombiesand hip-hop

Combining love and zombies might seem a little off—the—wall, but not for Jookabox

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staﬁf Writer

Jookabox
Thunderbird Café
4023 Butler St.
Nov. 4

A zombie musical, a love story,
white ﬂight and urban blight. Can
these disparate themes create a
single album‘? Moreover, why would
you combine them? ,

Jookabox front man David

“Moose” Adamson has the answers -

behind his band’s new album, Dead
Zone Boys. 4

“I was thinking a lot about what
is good and what is bad, what is
evil,” Adamson said. “I thought
zombies would be a goodway to
think about it. It just struck a chord
with me for some reason — the idea
of a zombie apocalypse.” '

Adamson said he doesn’t like to
do heavily conceptual albums, but
he does like to have a main theme
that ties an album together.

“The whole thing is completely
zombie inﬂuenced,” he said. “It’s all

. about darkness and light, and there

are zombie themes throughout.” .

Jookabox, previouslyknown ,

as Grampall Jookabox, will tour

as afour-person band for the ﬁrst -

time. Previously, recordings and

performances featured Adamson

as a one-man act.

Of the transition from soloist to
member of a full band, Adamson
said, “I think it sounds better and

clearer and louder. Before, I was
using a loop pedal to play a lot of
different instruments. It was fun,
but I think a lot of times the sound

' would suffer just because so many‘

things were happening at once all
through the PA.”

Adamson’s performance retains
remnants of his days performing
solo.

In addition to singing and play-
ing electric guitar, he uses a sam-
pler and plays the drums at various
points throughout the set.

Dead Zone B0}: is Adamson’s
third Jookaboxj album and ﬁrst
full—band effort. The album, which
hits stores today, took more than a
year to make. '

Adamson grew up on the east
side of Indianapolis, which he said
was “not a terrible place to live.”

Adamson said he got the idea
for the album’s title from an article

that mentioned an area on the near .
east side of Indianapolis that the

police referred to as the dead zone,
where most of the city’s murders
happened.

“I thought of that as .a funny
way to think of the place where
you live,” Adamson said. _“It kind
of said something about the way
police think, too.”

Adamson described his musical
style as being a product of his loca-
tion in the middleof the country.

“We get a lot of different inﬂu-
ences — hip-hop beats, distorted
garage guitars, folk harmonies. It’s a
little bit of a mishmash,” he said.

Adamson uses the undead as
a deeper metaphor for troubling
issues.

“Ithink about race relations a
lot and my place in the world, why
things are the way they are. All that
seeps through into the record,” he
said.

Adamson said his band name
came from his girlfriend, who will

probably rejoin the band for it’s

European tour next year once she
ﬁnishes school.

“There are words that she says
in strange ways, and one of them is
‘jukebox.’ It was sort of a drunken
conversation that ended up sticking
for some reason. The name chose
us,” he said.Another full-bandjook—
abox record is in the works. Perhaps

it will dip into the vampire craze?

“We’re writing and ﬁguring it
out right now,” Adamson said, “but
it’s deﬁnitely kooky and paranoid,
like always.”

When asked what audience
members should expect attending a
zombie—inﬂuenced concert, Adam-
son offered this piece of advice: “Be
ready to dance and be thrilled.”

Courtyjookabox

I spy with my little eye a band that makes music partially based on zombies.

Compelling jazz story gets onscreen treatment

_‘Round Midnight’ gives viewers insight to the Parisian jazz scene, with firsthand help from Pitt professor Nathan Davis

' Samantha Stahl
Senior Staﬂ" Writer

“Round.Midnight”
Nov. 3, 7 p.m. . I

William Pitt Union Assembly

Room

Set in the Parisian jazz scene
of the 1950s, “Round Midnight”
tells the story of an expatriate saxo-
phone player who struggled with
alcoholism. -

_. ._. W.-. H, __,__V,.,.,..,m;~.k.a.--s-_.. W...-...

The ﬁlm was originally slated
to be a documentary but became a
ﬁctionalized account of jazz legends
like Lester Young and Bud Powell,
according to Pitt’s director of jazz
studies, Nathan Davis.

Davis lived in Paris shortly be-
fore the ﬁlming.

While working as a musician in
the club where the movie was shot,
Davis said he put his expertise to use
when the producers needed to rep-
licate the famed Blue Note club.

,.._.._;..,....__,.-i...I.,,.-....,........ ,.... . .. W  V N. . ._.-,, __ ... _.,, , ..

The location served as the per-
fect backdrop for “Round Mid-
night,” but it had closed down years
prior.

So Davis suggested that produc-
ers rent another club and redeco-
rate. _

“They did a d*mn good job.
It looked just like it,” Davis said.
“The Blue Note was where all of us
played. I played with Kenny Clarke
there — one of the best jazz drum-
mers.” ‘

Davis said he almost got a part
in the ﬁlm.

Along with Mike Hennessey, the
former European editor of Billboard
magazine, Davis formed a group
called the Paris Reunion Band.

When the producers needed a

‘house band to star in “Round Mid-

night,” they went to Davis. <

But Davis said, “As the movie
took on life and they saw more
potential, they ended up choosing
Herbie Hancock. They went with

bigger names, so we just kept on
touring.”

Hancock won the Academy
Award for best music, original
score.

Dexter Gordon, who plays the
ﬁlm’s protagonist, Dale Turner, was
nominated for best actor in a lead-
ing role.

Directed by Bertrand Taverniei‘,

I the ﬁlm will play as part of the Eve-
ning jazz Week Film and Lectures

series.

Microsoft 7: the good, the bad and the uncertain

Despite issues with installation, Windows 7 slated to be more popular than its predecessor

Donaldlcampbell
Columnist

 

Windows 7 has been released, and
‘while it has received generally posi-
tive reviews, signs of its fallibility are
reaching the Internet, much to the
detriment of Microsoft and its ongo-
ing operating system reputation.

Although the quality ofWmdows
7 is arguably superior to that ofboth
Windows XP and Windows Vista, Mi-
crosoft might ﬁnd itself wrangling
with public relations and advertising
problems if the quirks of Windows
7 continue — or increase  fre-
quency.

 The sad part is that Microsoft’s
problems are likely undeserved.

A series of articles on Comput-
erworld.com described a rebooting
problem in the install and upgrade
process of Windows 7. The reports
also recommended that users who
have working systems should take
heed of the old adage, “don’t screw
with it” and delay upgrading.

Computerworld gave users tips

7 on making Windows XP “last for the

next seven years.” 7 s
Because this article was juxta-
posed to the previous two, it is rea-

- sonabletothinkthatComputerworld

hints that a Windows 7 upgrade might
be detrimental. '

The good news for Microsoft?
Windows 7 appears to have ducked
the minor upgrade problems that
plagued Vista.

For example, fewer people have
reported “catastrophic irritation
syndrome,” which was endemic in
Vista, because of Vista’s incessant
prompts for security escalations.

Microsoft has also ﬁelded fewer
calls regarding driver difficulties and
program compatibility issues under
Windows 7. . _

The bad news for Microsoft‘?
The ﬁr-‘st major problem many us-
ers have experienced is a little more
ﬁmdamental: They cannot install the
Windows 7 upgrade at all.

Some users have experienced a
“constant reboot” problemwhere the
installation process freezes around
two—thirds of the way through and
reboots the system — endlessly.

Microsoft engineers have also

  

failed to deliver a quick and, more’
importantly, near-universal remedy
for this problem.

Microsoft might think that the
sum of Windows 7 ’s gains over Vista
and the overall infréquency of its one
problem might add up to a positive.

Microsoft — as little

as many of us want to

admit it‘—‘ might need 5
‘ to be cut some slack.

The general support requesttraf-
ﬁc, as Computerworld cites, is much,
lower than when Vista emerged.

This undoubtedly makes Micro-
soft think that its Windows 7 operat-
ing system will become much more
popular and more respected than
the failed Vista. .

Microsoft has recently had prob-

lems and has immediately pushed its
way squarely onto users’ bad sides.
Reports of the reboot problem might
very well pose a problem for Micro-
soft’s public relations.

Microsoft might therefore face a
problem of having many people turn
— perhaps irrationally — against

‘ Windows 7, as many reacted adverse-

ly to Vista’s slight annoyances.

Windows 7 might be plagued
by thinking similarly to that of the
company featured in Gregg Keizer’s
article, “Users should delay Windows
7 upgrade, support ﬁrm warns.”

The article describes the com-
pany’s assertion that upgrading to
Windows 7 could pose problems with
data retention, as well as hardware
compatibility and software stabil-
ity.

Users, according to the com-
pany, should therefore continue to

use their old operating systems until ‘

the upgrade process for Windows 7
has aged and become more predict-
able. V

What will Microsoft do if reports
of its reboot problem become more
frequent and Windows 7 begins to

scare away potential customers who
fear a constant reboot might lock
their machines?

Could this mean that Windows 7
will go the way of Vista -— wherein
users who never tried the operat-
ing system will assert that Windows
7 is not worth the upgrade and will
therefore never buy it?

Users should remember that both A
Linux and Macintosh OS X, the stan- '

dard alternatives to Microsoft Win-
dows, have also experienced, andwill
more than likely continue to experi-
ence, upgrade problems.

Macintosh OS X recently expe-
rienced a non-zero population of
programs that failed to install and
run properly when users upgraded
to the most recent edition.

Microsoft e as little as many of
us want to admit it —- might need to
be cut some slack. “

Although the article describing
the reasons to delay an upgrade might
be accurate for users who rarely back
up their information or cannot afford
temporary disruptions in computer
service, upgrading for the rest of us
is not really that dangerous.

Third place Panthers spike volleyball excitement

The team clinched its second consecutive Big East Tournament with two wins this weekend

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Don’t look now, but the Pitt wom-
en’s volleyball team is a top-three
team and a serious contender for
the Big East crown.

With three games left in the '

regular season, Pitt (17—8 overall,
9-2 Big East), has mathematically
secured its second straight trip to
the Big East Tournament, accord-
ing to coach Toby Rens.

“I think nine wins‘ was‘ that
magic number coming into the
year,” Rens said. _

The tournament, which is in
Louisville, Ky., this year, takes the

top eight of the 15 teams in the Big L

East. Pitt sits in third place in the
conference, behind Notre Dame
and Cincinnati —— the only two
teams it lost to this season.

The Panthers have three games
remaining. They will host Villano-
Va, Seton Hall and Rutgers.

Pitt took care of two teams this
weekend —— last year’s regular sea~
son Big East champion St. John’s
and Connecticut —— both by shut-
outs. The games were Pitt’s third
and fourth consecutive shutouts.

“St. John’s is a "very talented

team. It was a very good win,”
Rens said. “They have a very good
crowd and experienced players.
We put a lot of focus on blocking

_in preparations. We had 18 against

St. John’s. For a three—set match
to have 18 blocks is phenomenal.
That really helped us.”

Senior Meagan Dooley led Pitt
to victory over St. John’s Friday
with a match-high 10 blocks and
six kills, while junior Imani Harper
had an impressive nine kills and
seven blocksf

Sophomore Allyson Hodnik
secured Pitt’s 3-0 victory with 25
assists. '

It was more of the same against
the Huskies. Hodnik posted 45

assists, while Dooley and senior J

Melissa Stadelman had 17 and 10
kills, respectively

The Panthers had 27 team
blocks, for the weekend. After
its back—to—back wins, Pitt ranks

eighth out of 329 teams in the

country, averaging 2.82 [blocks
per set. .

Pitt heads into this week-
‘ end having not lost a set in four

matches‘. "
A “The two big things [through
the last four games] have been

Young teamhits the mat in season

Fourteen Panthers place in Buffalo Open while junior Tomei named wrestler of the week

Greg Trietley
Staﬁ" Writer

Pitt athletics underwent a youth
movement during the offseason.
In football, freshman running
back Dion Lewis replaced the de-
parted LeSean McCoy. This season,
thePitt basketball team looks to re-
place the trio of Sam Young, DeJuan
, Blair and Levance Fields.
On Sunday, Pitt wrestlingﬂaunted
its young blood when true freshman
Danejohnson won his ﬁrst collegiate

’ ‘tournament. He was one of 14 Pan-

thers to place in the season—opening
Buffalo Open.

1 Johnson won the 141-pound class "

out of aﬁeld of 23 wrestlers. The wres-
tling youth movement impressed Pitt
coach Rande Stottlemyer.

“As we continue to that next level,

we just want to do better,” Stottle-
myer said. “But We’re young. We’re
not a real experienced team, but we
have some talent to compete.”

Another young Pitt wrestler
joined Johnson in the winner’s cir-
cle.

Sophomore Matt Wilps won the
197—pound title. Like Johnson, the

win is Wilps’ ﬁrst collegiate tourna—‘

ment title.

Two hundred forty—eight wres-
tlers from,27 schools participated in
the day—long tournament.

With such a large event, Stottle-

myer said, competitors can ﬁnd the
day tough. .

“We had guys wrestle seven or
eight matches [Sunday] ,” Stottlemyer
said. “That’s a lot of wrestling.”

"Sophomore Chris Kochinsky
alone wrestled six opponents Sun-
day, securing third place in the 125-
pound class. He climbed through the
consolation bracket after losing his
opening round match to Rutgers’
Matt Fusco 6-3.

Veteran Panthers made their
mark on the tournament, as well.

Stottlemyer said that perhaps the
most impressive Panther was junior
Ryan Tomei. Tomei captured the ﬁfth

’ tournamentwin ofhis career Sunday,
knocking off ﬁve opponents to take

.the heavyweight title.

The Eastern Wrestling League
recognized Tomei after Sunday’s
affair for competing internationally
over the summer.

“He won the EWL wrestler of the
week,” Stottlemyer said.

Returning home this week forthe
Blue- Gold Match Thursday evening,
Stottlemyer said he hopes his wres-
tlers continue to perform well.

“We want to compete on a nation-
al level,” Stottlemyer said. “Putting
guys on the All-American podium is
what we’re trying to do.”

Stottlemyer said the Buffalo Open
was a good tournament to start the
season, as it mixed together many
different wrestling squads. Schools

opener e~

from the NJCAA and the NCAA Divi-
sions I, II and II all participated. 4:

“With the Buffalo Open, you’re
taking some really good teams with
some not—so—good teams,” Stottle-
myer said. “You want to try and get
a good pace going, get ready for that
quality of competition.”

The tournament featured three:
nationally ranked Division I teams
and seven nationally ranked Division
I wrestlers. 1

Though the Panthers started the
season well, the squad won’t rest on
its laurels, Stottlemyer said. There’s_‘
always room to improve.

Nonetheless,Johnson could live »
with more tournaments like Sun-
day’s.

The Panthers were breaking in
new starters and players — even
while facing nationally ranked
competition — including Harper,

Brittany Fallis, Rens said.

“The improvements all of them

Hodnik has stepped into the
setter position on the team. The
setter is the equivalent of a point

the Panthers’ success.

“I had worked in practice play-

pretty easy transition,” Hodnik
said. “But it was tough because
you knew going in that being a
starter, you’d have the pressure on
your back. But the players around

me are awesome and it makes my

Hodnik also credited a solid
