HPS center celebrates
25 years on campus

By Leeli Davidson
For The Pitt News

University of Pittsburgh's Center for
Philosophy of Science celebrated its
25th anniversary in December 1985 by
holding a two-day conference. The
conference drew philosophers from
around the world to discuss past and
present scientific discoveries and their
philosophical implications.

Many of the conference speakers had
been active members of the Center for
Philsophy of Science during its first
five years of existence, when it was a
pioneer in the field of philosophical
research institutes. The Center, found-
ed by Adolph Grunbaum and Charles
Peak in 1960. confers no degrees and
offers no courses for credit. Its interests
lie solely in research, and it exists as
a haven for those doing research in
Philosophy of Science. Most research-
ers are university professors on
sabbaﬁcaL

There are 30 permanent members of
the Center, and" each year there are
around eight visiting scholars. Each
member ofthe Department of History
and Philosophy of Science is automat-
ically a member of the Center.
Although the Center offers no formal
classes, scholars interact through a
series of informal workshops and col-
loquia designed to keep members
aware of what their colleagues are
doing.

Professor Nicholas Rescher, direc-
tor of the Center since 1981, said that
the object of the Center is to give the
resident faculty “more colleagues to
work with“ and to see that the visiting
researcher “receives a broader basis of
contact" than he would working in
isolation. '

Founder and chairman Adolph Grun-
baum also defends the Center in argu-
ing that it opens up thejacademic com-
munity to diverse views.

IFC disputes alcohol policy

By William Young
Staff Writer

A dispute is brewing between Pitt’s
administration and the Interfraternity
Council after a recent decision by the
administration to initiate a completely
dry rush in the fall of 1986. The deci-
sion was made, according to Student
Activities Director Andrew Smith.
after evaluating the effectiveness of the
rush policy over the past several years.

“It is obvious,” Smith said, “after
going through five rushes, that the
alcohol rush is a failure. We have com-
piled statistics that show. while more
people are going to the fraternities for
parties, fewer are signing up to join
them. And by the laws of the state of
Pennsylvania, a wet’ rush is illegal.”

IFC President Nasos Georgiadis said
he does agree that the present rush
policy has not worked effectively in the
past. “The way rush has been run in
the past is a joke,” Georgiadis said.
“The IFC never enforced the closed
rush functions, and people bought rush
cards to drink beer.“

However, Georgiadis said he op-
poses the new dry rush policy. At an
IFC meeting on Jan. 14, Georgiadis ex-
pressed his disapproval of the policy
and promoted an almost unanimous
vote, from the fraternity presidents at-
tending the meeting, to fight the
decision.

“The issue here is not alcohol, but
rather our right to have private func-
tions during rush,” Georgiadis said.-
“And there is a present policy which,
if enforced, would be the most
beneficial.”

Smith contends. though. that the IFC
has not even been asked to approve or
oppose the decision. but rather to help
implement the new program because
the previous policy was not effective
(or even legal).

Prof visits

Staff Writer

Dr. Bruno Podesta is Pitt’s Andrew
W. Mellon visiting professor for this
winter term.

During his tenure, he will be
teaching two courses through the
Department of Sociology. The classes
are “Culture. State and Society in Latin
America" and “Science, Technology
and Development in Latin America."

While at home in Lima, Peru,
Podesta works as an associate professor
in the Department of Social and
Political Sciences at the Universidad de
Pacifico, where he conducts his
research.

For the past five years, Podesta has
been studying the means of acquiring
technology for Latin America.
specifically through
organizations, such as the United Na-
tions and the Organization of American
States. -

While in the United States, Podesta
will visit institutions and industries and
observe their policies concerning
technology. By doing so. he can use the

international ‘

“According to the laws of the state
of Pennsylvania. it is illegal for some-
one undcr the age of 21 to drink
alcoholic beverages." Smith said. “It
has become a method for a lot of peo-

ple to pay $5 for a rush card and then

to go drink a lot of beer for free. The
majority, by far, of the people going
to these functions are not 21.”
When informed that the IFC had
‘voted and decided to reject the proposal
to go to a dry rush policy. Smith
responded: “I did not request or re-
quire they vote on it. I was requesting

ideas, presenting them the ‘opportuni-
ty to design the particulars of a dry rush
here at the University of Pittsburgh. I
think there may have been some
misunderstanding on the part of the
president of the IFC on his part as to
what to do. _

"I was encouraging the IFC to take
on a leadership role. I was asking
Nasos for the Interfraternity Council’s
ideas on how to integrate the new
system. I was not trying to force him
to do anything - he misunderstood me
completely. I was attempting to get in-
put on dry rush functions. Make no
mistake about it, there will be dry rush

“You can hardly focus on Latin

from Peru

Georgiadis said the IFC does not
believe what it terms as a “proposal to
go to an all dry rush schedule.” but
rather sees it as an infringement on
their rights. Georgiadis added that he
is not going to take the decision to con-
vert lying down or allow the universi-
ty to deny them “the right to sponsor
private functions for their brothers and
their invited guests. This right is ap-
plied to the period of rush, as allowed
by the existing policy.

"We protest the university attitude
to ignore our voice and opinions over
matters that govern our lives,”
Georgiadis said. “Even though I come
from the motherland of democracy, I
never thought I would have to give
lessons on democracy in this country
which is. itself. a symbol for freedom
and democracy.”

In a letter from the IFC board to
Smith. the. IFC relayed its opposition
to the administration. “During its
regular meeting of Tuesday, Jan. '14,
the Interfraternity Council discussed
the issue of adopting a rush program
entirely absent of alcoholic
beverages,” the letter stated. “After a‘
vote was taken, the decision reached
was that such a program would be
damaging to the recruitment efforts of
the fraternities and thus the proposal
was rejected. Instead the council decid-
ed to enforce the existing official rush

policy, which has not been effectively A

enforced to date.”

Smith. however, said he does not
believe the recruitment would be
damaged. He said that if the fraternities
were to actively promote a dry rush
system. there would be no problem.
“Most college campuses have no wet
rush program and they have quite suc-
cessful greek systems.“ Smith said.
"The movement is away from wet to
dry. There are not a whole lot of logical
defenses to say that you are opposed
to a dry rush. If they are not active

to teach

Every Latin American country is linked
to a more developed one. What I‘m do-
ing here is seeing what goes on in the
United States.”

Podesta hopes eventually to col-
laborate with his government to
develop coherent, effective strategies
for obtaining technology. This would
be done by examining the policies of
the government and international
organizations, and matching them to
produce the most cost effective and
labor benefiting program.

Through his education, Podesta has
been able to witness different societies
and their innovations. Podesta received
the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree
in business administration while
studying in Peru. He pursued a degree
in sociology at the University of North
Carolina and continued his studies at
the Institute of Latin American Studies
at the Universityof Texas. Then he
traveled to Italy where he earned his
doctorate.

Podesta travels to the United States
approximately twice a year to further
his research. “You have extremely
good conditions here for research,” he
said. “I‘m very glad I’m spending the
time here.” '

18 years past: A retrospect of Martin Luther King Jr.

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

For millions of Americans, Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. was their voice of
anguish in a battle for human dignity.
He provided a bridge of communica-
tion between whites and blacks when
racial warfare threatened to tear apart
the United States in the 1960s.

And for 15 years after his death.
King’s supporters fought to honor him

and his cause with a national holiday.
On Nov. 2. 1983. when President
Reagan signed a bill establishing the
third Monday in January as Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King Day. King became the
only American other than George
Washington to be honored with a na-
tional legal holiday.

It may be necessary, however, to
review King‘s life and his struggle to
fully appreciate the holiday and the
message that he tried to convey.

King was born Jan. 15, 1929. the
second of three children to the Rev.

Martin Luther King Sr. and Mrs.
Alberta Christine Williams King in
Atlanta. Ga.

An excellent student. King skipped
12th grade and was admitted to
Morehouse College. After graduating
at age 19 "from Morehouse with a
bachelor of arts in sociology, King
entered Crozer Theological Seminary.
At Crozer, King was one of only six
black students. He became president of
the senior class and a recipient of a
graduate fellowship.

In 1953, at the age of 24, King was

I say to you today, my friends,
so even though we face the dif-
ficulties of today and tomorrow, I
still have a dream. It is a dream
deeply rooted in the American
dream. I have a dream that one day
this nation will rise up and live out
the true meaning of its creed: “We
hold these truths to be self—evident,
that all men are created equal.” I
have a dream that one day on the
red hills of Georgia, sons of former
slaves and the sons of former slave
owners will be able to sit down
together at the table of
brotherhood. I have a dream that
one day even the state of Mississip-
pi. a state sweltering with the heat
of injustice. sweltering with the
heat of oppression, will be
transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a
dream that my four little children

s will one day live in a nation where

they will not be judged by the col—
or oftheir skin, but by the content
of their character.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day
down -in Alabama — with its
vicious racists, with its governor
having his lips dripping with the
works of interposition and
nullifieation — one day right there
in Alabama, little black boys and
girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and girls as sisters
and brothers.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day
“every valley shall be exalted and
every hill and mountain shall be
made low. The rough places will
be made plain and the crooked
places will be made straight,” and
“the glory of the Lord shall be
revealed, and all ﬂesh shall see it
together.”

This is our hope. This is the faith

“I have a Dream”

The following is an ex-
cerpt from Martin
Luther King Jr.’s
speech, delivered to
more than 250,000 sup-
porters in front of the
Lincoln Memorial in
Washington, D.C. on
Aug. 20, 1963.

that I go back to the South with.
With this faith we will be able to
hew out of the mountain of despair
a stone of hope. With this faith we
shall be able to transform the jan-
gling discord of our nation into a
beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we
will be able to work together, to
pray together, to struggle together,
to go to jail together, to stand up
for our freedom together. knowing
that we will be free one day. And
this will be the day. This will be

the day when all of God’s children -

will be able to sing with new mean-
ing: “My country ‘us of thee.
sweet land of liberty. of thee I sing.
Land where my father died. land
of the pilgrims pride, from every
mountainside, let freedom ring."
And if America is to be a great na-
tion, this.must become true.

So let freedom ring from the pro-
digious hilltops of New Hamp-
shire; let freedom ring from the
mighty mountains of New York;

let freedom ring from the heighten-
+1

ing Alleghenies of Pennsylvania:
let freedom ring from the snow-
capped Rockies of Colorado: let
freedom ring from the curvaceous
slopes of California. But not only
that. Let freedom ring from Stone
Mountain of Georgia; let freedom

ring from Lookout Mountain of

Tennessee; let freedom ring from
every hill and molehill
Mississippi. From every mountain-
side, let freedom ring.

And when this happens, and
when we allow freedom to ring,
when we let it ring from every
village and every hamlet. from
every state and every city, we will
be able to speed up that day when
all God’s children, black men and
white men, Jews and Gentiles.
Protestants and Catholics, will be
able to join hands and sing in the
words of the old Negro spiritual:
“Free at last. Free at last. Thank
Almighty God, we are free at
last.”

of

married to Coretta Scott in Marion.
Ala.. in a ceremony performed by
Kings father. Two years later he
received his Ph.D. in systematic
theology from Boston University. Just
a few months after King finished his
studies in Boston. a woman was ar-
rested in Alabama, an isolated incident
which was to change his life forever.

On Dec. 1. 1955. a black seamstress
named Rosa Parks refused to give up
her seat to a white passenger on a
segregated Montgomery city bus. She
explained that her feet were tired
because she had been shopping all day,
but Parks was arrested and fined $10.

In a sense. that arrest sparked the
beginning ofthe civil rights movement
and the ensuing boycott led by King.
who was then a young Baptist minister
in Montgomery. The boycott led in
turn to Kings and others‘ arrests. The
case was taken to a U.S. district court.
which ruled that the Montgomery bus
segregation laws were unconstitutional.
Finally. in November 1956. the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld the district court
ruling in an appeal and Montgomery
city buses were racially integrated for
the first time. King was nationally
recognized as a powerful black leader.

In 1958 King’s first book. “Strike
Toward Freedom: The Montgomery
Story.“ was published. and the
minister had a close brush with death.
While he was autographing his book in
Harlem. a black woman named Izola
Curry charged at King with a knife and
stabbed him. She was later said to be
mentally deranged. King recovered.
and in early 1959 he and his wife spent
a month in India studying Gandhi's
techniques of non—violence.

In October 1960. King and 51 others
were arrested in Atlanta for par-
ticipating in a sit-in and werejailed on
charges of violating the state's trespass
laws. The trespass charges were soon
dropped. however. and all the
demonstrators were released except for
King. He was held on separate charges
of violating a probationary sentence
from a previous traffic case.

King remembered at

Page 3

Perhaps because King had been ar-
rested many times before for civil

disobedience. this time he was sent to

Alabama‘s Reidsville State Prison.

Robert F. Kennedy. then campaign
manager for presidential candidate
John F. Kennedy. intervened on King’s
behalf. and King was released on a
$2,000 appeal bond.

Nevertheless. King was soon ar-
rested again, this time for leading civil
rights marches in 1961 and 1962 in
Albany. NY. He was jailed once more
in 1963. when he led the Birmingham
campaign to protest segregation. It was
then that King wrote his famous “Let-
ter from the Birmingham Jail.”

Perhaps the climax of King‘s career
came on Aug. 28. 1963. when the
largest integrated mass protest. The
March on Washington. occurred. King
gave his triumphant “I Have a Dream”
speech before 250,000 people at the
Lincoln Memorial. [See insert]

The question King raised. “Where
Do We Go From Here?“ (the title of
his sixth book), was answered in the
summers of 1966 and 1967 with bloody
race riots in northern American cities.
Hundreds were killed during violent
protests in Detroit. Los Angeles and
Newark. N.J.

Kings practice of non—violence was
challenged by some black groups when
they adopted the slogan “Black
Power." Some black extremists held

contempt for King. calling him an .

“Uncle Tom."

Violence threatened to split the civil
rights movement and alienated the
white liberal establishment which sup-
ported the black cause at the time. But
criticism from radicals did not deter
King from believing in the potential of
the American democratic ideal and his
faith in the goodness of mankind.

King was shot and killed on April 4,
1968. while he was standing on the
balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Mem-
phis. James Earl Ray was later con-
victed for his murder.

repertory theater

By Shannon Smuts
For The Pitt News

Wednesday night. in the WPU
Ballroom, the Kuntu Repertory Theatre
performed "Lift Every Voice and
Sing." in honor of Martin Luther King
Jr.‘s birthday. The commemorative
event was powerful and extremely
successful.

Donald Frazier, president of the
Kuntu Repertory Theatre. said
Wednesday morning: “We’re hoping
for a big audience.” And hereceived
one. The approximately 250 seats were
ﬁlled, with people standing scattered
throughout the room.

According to Frazier, this was the
first time the Black Action Society
organized such a celebration for Kings
birthday. They had arranged com-
memorative events in the past for King,
but never anything this big.

The Kuntu Theatre was founded, in
October 1974. by Vernell A. Lillie and
Professor Rob Penny, who was a
playwright in residence at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. The purpose of the
theater was to organize between six and
16 performers into a group. The group
would conduct performances which
would promote consciousness of the
contributions of blacks from the past

through the present. The company has
been successful and now frequently
performs in both elementary and high
schools in addition to colleges. Last
year, they presented “Who Loves a
Dancer" at the University of Pittsburgh
and two years ago. “A Raisin in the
Sun." which was a great success.

For “Lift Every Voice and Sing,”
the 11 theater members wore plain
black and white costumes. The presen-
tation was a conglomeration of talking,
dancing and singing. Each event
showed some aspect of the black strug-
gle for equality. Excerpts from King’s
speeches, including “I Have A
Dream,” in addition to others’
speeches, were recited. Music of both
the present, such as songs by Aretha
Franklin, and the past, such as old
gospel music, was played to emphasize
the black struggle for freedom and the
need for union among blacks. Also, ex-
amples of discrimination were
dramatized, such as the Rosa Parks bus
incident.

The audience, made up of mostly
students. responded enthusiastically to
the performance. Clapping and loud
voices of assent continually were heard
from the rear of the ballroom. People
clapped to the beat of some songs and
responded loudly when statements
were made about the need to free South‘
Africa.

Educate yourselves:

The Black Action Society, in coalition with Students for a Free
South Africa, will be commemorating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
in a symposium today at 2 p.m. in the WPU Assembly Room.
Speakers include the internationally reknowned South African poet
and next year’s chairman of Black Studies Dennis Brutus, SFSAf_s

Base Retribution

The cold logic of the old formula _“An eye
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth” is bone-
chilling. Its steely, dispassionate rationality is
as steadfastly undeniable as it is ruthless and
savage. Doubtless, it makes eminent good
sense that an individual who has committed
the most wicked of crimes — murder — should
also, by way of exacting justice, lose his life.
This certainly appeals to the sense of reason,
does it not? _

Yet contemplating the grim reality of capital
punishment makes one sick to the stomach;
there is no escaping a retching sense of
thoroughgoing moral repugnance. Implicit in
the death penalty is an immature emotional
response —— the base desire for vengeance. An
execution in some ways satisfies this juvenile,
errant impulse, while the clinical, detached
method by which it is achieved allows us to
remain untouched by its consequences. But it
is impossible not to cringe in moral revulsion
when made to appreciate the grotesqueness of
such a horrifying procedure. Perhaps all those
who advocate capital punishment should be
made to witness an execution first—hand.

Yes, indeed, a society must protect itself
from those who would do it harm, but to re-
tain its integrity it must do so in a just and
ethical manner. It is not enough that our
system of criminal justice is stern; it must also
be compassionate. It must make every effort
to rehabilitate the criminal, to allow him the
opportunity to repent. No longer can we-allow
the state to murder in retribution. We must de-
mand an end to such primitive, immoral
practices. '

The Ritual Dissent/James M. Crary

Marijuana Should Be Legal

Alaskans, it is said. grow excellent
home-grown reefer, where it is
decriminalized to have a houseplant in
the nursery. You don’t even have to
pretend it’s African Bamboo. Think of
it — the world’s best marijuana —
grown right here in the U.S. of A. It
rouses feelings of Patriotism, to be
sure. Personally, as a member of a
democracy, I’ve never really been
comfortable with people just partying,
the law be damned. It makes much
more sense for mature people, who
know the real effects of grass and their
own limits, to choose for themselves
when and when not to smoke. This, be-
ing a democracy, should convince par-
tyers to stop smoking and join the Na-
tional Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws and_ vote into power
people who will get pot into our super-
markets. It would end drug wards, drug
wars, lower the number of prisoners

for victimless crimes, bring in much
needed federal revenue, and remove
the public health hazard of marijuana
laced with paraquat, which is going to
kill people prematurely. Marijuana
laws in Pennsylvania are wildly
paranoid about a relatively harmless
weed;

But marijuana users go on to try
harder drugs! Even though I doubt this,
suppose it’s true. The reason is really
because the laws tend to make mari-
juana look so bad that when somebody
tries a hit and discovers that it was ex-
aggerated in significance, one tends to
distrust the other laws surrounding
other, very dangerous, drugs. The laws
themselves are responsible for people
going from toking to mainlining, if or
when that ever happens.

It's high time (high time, indeed) for

tokers to put away the bowl and start
petitioning; start lobbying and discus-
sing the realities of marijuana, rather
than remaining docile, passive and
suicidally apathetic about the routine
victimization our anachronistic laws
demand of prisoners of conscience who
have gotten high, because they like to,
because they know it‘s ridiculous to

consider it more dangerous than"

alcohol. (Who wouldn’t rather have
someone high driving home from a par-
ty than someone crocked?)

Students are such brown-nosed
turkeys anymore. There are good
reasons for the freedom of the press.
the freedom of speech and civil liber-
ties. It’s not just a question of being
“impractical" or “rocking the boat,"
it‘s a question of American integrity,
freedom, conscience and truth. Once
upon a time, tea was illegal in England.
Anybody for a tea party?

The Bare Bones/Steven Seel

An Act Of Courtesy Or A Legal Act

There has been much debate lately
regarding the fairness of banning smok-
ing in public and the workplace. The
popular question seems to be: Whose
rights are more important. the smokers’
or the non-smokers"? Everybody con-
cerned has different views regarding
the possible ban. A person‘s views
seem to change according to their pre-
sent smoking status.

I think there are three distinct rela-
tionships a person can have with smok-
ing. A person either is presently a
smoker. is an ex—smoker or has never
smoked before. Each group has its own
perspective and interests concerning a
smoking ban, usually to the exclusion
of another group's interests. I consider
ex—smokers and non-smokers as shar-
ing the same basic interests concern-
ing the issue. Most ex—smokers have
experienced each perspective. Even
longtime smokers were non-smokers if,
at no other time. as younger children.
They become smokers for some period
of their lives and then quit, becoming
ex—smokers. I personally fit into the
striving—to-be-reformed/ex—smoker
category.

I think the main reason for the con-
tlict over the smoking ban stems from
the different groups' inabilities to see
the others’ perspectives. Up until now.
smokers argued that as free individuals.
they have the right to endanger their
own health however they wanted. They
claimed that it was their own health
they were risking and that non-smokers
were oftenjust being overly sensitive.
I think the real issue is now more than
just one group's rights over another's.
There is now medical evidence show-

ing that cigarette smoke is more than
just an annoyance to exposed non-
smokers — it’s a health risk.

A recent Surgeon General’s report
dealt with “passive smoking" —~ the
non—smoker’s inhaling smoke when he
is exposed to a smoker’s exhalations
and the smoke from the burning end of
the smoker’s cigarette. The findings
linked second—hand smoke to increased
incidence of lungcancer and other car-
diovascular diseases in exposed non-
smokers. According to some research-
ers, second—hand smoke contains cer-
tain toxins in even higher concentra-
tions than in the smoke originally in-
haled by the smoker.

What smokers always have con-
sidered to be a personal freedom is now
an act that endangers the health of all
those around them. By choosing to
smoke around non-smokers, a smoker
is really forcing non-smokers to smoke
against their will. Most non-smokers
and ex—smokers have chosen not to
smoke to avoid the risks associated
with smoking. Smoking in the
presence of objecting non-smokers is
forcing that health risk on them against
their will. In a sense. it is very much
like an assault —- a medical assault.
Non—smokers now have the power of
medical evidence in their favor which.
in my view. voids any and‘ all
arguments smokers offer to defend
their right to smoke wherever they
please. It all boils down to proven
medical risks versus personal enjoy-
ment at the possible expense of others.
In my opinion. it is not much of a
contest.

I am certainly not a person to con-

demn smokers. The truth is that I have
been known to light up on occasion
(though not often). But I make a prac-
tice of not smoking around people I do
not know or who I know object. If a
person asks me ifI mind his smoke,
I generally do not care. However, I ap-
preciate being asked. and I try to ex-
tend the same courtesy to others. In a
sense. this is a simple matter of con-
sideration among people. While I cer-
tainly do not agree with ex-smokers or
non-smokers who preach to the “poor.
weak smokers,” I am equally offend-
ed by smokers who light up without
regard to those around them. When it
takes a law to make people consider-
ate of those around them. then I guess
it is a sad statement of the times.

' ' ‘ 1 it - V ‘Cutting Edges: Making Sense Of The

  

Eighties

' By Charles Krauthammer
A Random House

The title of this book is greatly
misleading; it gives the false impres-
sion that you are about to be dragged
unrelentingly through the filth and
decay of the techno-pop gutter. But
make no mistake, this is no mere glib
and superficial treatment of the flash
and glitter that is pop culture. On the
contrary, Charles Krauthammer’s book
debut does much to illuminate the
prevailing myths, fads and politics of
the ’80s.

Cutting Edges, a collection of
Krauthammer’s most brilliant, probing
essays which first appeared in The
New Republic, The Washington Post
and Time, treats a wide array of topics,
not the least of which include ter-

_ rorism, nuclear morality, abortion, foot-

ball, Baby Fae and suicide. Krautham-
mer brings to each subject a refreshing
originality of thought that (astonishing-
ly) is not doctrinaire in the least, along

with a curious talent for rendering sen-

  

‘ of our times. In his writing, Krautham-
g mer is never one to be timid; the

-lwriting: never does it degenerate into "

nside: the votes are in and
Madonna’s out. see

challenge posed by our maddening
times leaves him undaunted. We find
him striding resolutely into the swirling,
chaotic reality of modern society,
whereupon he grapples determinedly
with the major paradoxes confronting
humanity in the ’80s. The results are
enlightening, compelling and .
provocative.

While Krauthammer is, beyond a
doubt, possessed of a brilliant, incisive
mind, and, although he handles his
subjects with all the fastidious care of
the scholar, his work is by no means
esoteric. His elegance of style and his
captivating wit makes the writing both
spellbinding and easily accessible.
Krauthammer writes, “[b]aseba|l, with
its pauses and anticipations, its
delicate sequentialism, lends itself to
abstraction — and poetry.” The same 
may just as easily be said of his

Showcase, January 17, 1986

By Matthew Yokobosky

Throughout the world, American
cinema is distinguished by its action,
France for its stylistic design and the
Japanese for their careful attention to
mood. In many respects, these three
national cinemas are thematically
related, but individualized physical,
structural and psychological genres. In
America, and especially Pittsburgh,
the release of foreign films is a slow
process, leaving audiences often to
flounder for their meanings due to their
infrequent distribution. As such, when
Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters arriv-
ed in the steel city, advance notices of
the Paul Schrader film won little en-
thusiasm. Although I do agree that the
narrative itself makes for a disjointed
story, the external aesthetics and the
implied philosophical statements
elevate the film’s worth.

With production delegated through
the hands of Francis Coppola and
George Lucas, Schrader sought to ex-
amine the intellectual picture of Yukio
Mishima (Ken Ogata), a man that
Japan hailed as one of their premier
modern writers. Unfortunately, as the
country loaded praise on his insightful
works based on social interaction,
Mishima felt that after the age of 40 the
body could no longer revitalize its
youth, leaving the 45-year-old man of
letters tocommit public hara-kiri. His
death occurred in 1970, his memory
remains through his conception of a
spiritual army, which sought to prepare
Japan mentally for the future —— a
world without nuclear weaponry.

Without aid from Mishima’s widow,
Paul and Leonard Schrader wrote a
script which focused on Yukio’s ‘‘life
as art” motivation, which centered
around his belief that bisexuality was

a means to imitate the androgeny of
God, and his aspiratTon to return Japan
to a spirituality that evaded their
culture during the Tokugawa (Edo)
period. After they presented the
manuscript to his widow, she de-

Divided into four interrelated

assembles his death sequence from

uniform to his end,_ three of his an-

thologies and scenes from his
adolescence which appear to be the
basis for his sociological perceptions.
ln naturalistic tones, the first section re-
counts his ceremony to cessation, his
planned storming of the president’s

     

quarters and his admission that
perhaps a life spent in search of artistic
excellence and perfection is no more
valuable or aesthetic than the raw un-
talented life of the common man. Can
one man turn a nation to the

A flame ignites in
Out ofAfrica

By Lori Faiella

Sydney Pol|ack’s consistent suc-
cess continues with Out ofAfrica. The
13 films directed by Pollack thus far,
including Tootsie, Absence of Malice

and Bobby Deerfield which have '

received 31 Academy Award nomina-
tions; and from the looks ofthings, Out
of Africa is likely to increase this
already astounding number.

Out of Africa is a true story of one
woman’s personal experiences in
Africa. The movie is based not on one
book but on several combined to
create a compelling story of life, love
and tragedy. This basis includes

several books (Out of Africa, Letters
from Africa) by Karen Blixen, the
woman portrayed in Out of Africa,
which are both listed under Blixen’s
former name, Isak Dinesen. These
autobiographies recount her experi-
ences as a coffee farmer in Kenya.

Out of Africa is a moving portrayal
of Blixen’s life, as well as an expres-
sion of her deep—rooted complex emo-
tions. She’s a lonely woman battling
for something of her “own.”

Meryl Streep stars as Karen Blixen;
once again she performed to perfec-
tion. Her dramatic style brings Karen
Blixen back to life and into the hearts

leafed ground, vibrant skies and an
erupting volcano of virtue —- the
pavilion. Next, Kyoko’s House (Art) ex-
amines the duality of pain and
pleasure that exist within the land of
love, except that this relationship
focuses on a graphic representation of
masochistic sexual pleasure. Finally,
in a visually exciting implimentation of
Runaway Horses (Action), a
claustrophobic stage is the setting for
combining eroticism and seduction
within a sociopolitical plot to overthrow
the government. Thus, the
chameleonesque interior of Mishima’s
inner drives for sexual liberation and
political freedom are alluded to,
creating an essentially non-verbal
display of the same emotions that
Mishima’s widow seemed to want to
exclude from the film.

To contrast the Technicolor beauty
of these three poetic scenarios, black
and white footage recounts young
Yukio’s adolescence — his introduc-
tion to the theatre and his attraction to
men. While these sections are largely
uninteresting, there is a brilliant se-
quence briefly analyzing Hosoe’s
photographic series of Mishima. The
posed photos dissolve into still-life por-
traits. ln Hosoe’s original photographs,
the barriers and uncertainties of pure
whites and blacks assemble to
transform the human figure into
Rorschach-like designs.

The final sequence brings the five
separate stories into one intricately in-
terspliced scene of suicides, all
representative of Mishima. For me,
Mishima is perhaps the most poetic
film I have ever viewed, but ostensibly,
it makes the viewer wary of Paul
Schrader’s proposed explanation of
Yukio Mushima’s life. To read the film
for all of its detail would require multi-
ple viewings — a trait of the best
cinematic triumphs — but in this case,
the aestheticization of this film, unlike
Mishima’s life, is a failure. What it lacks
in brilliant narration is compensated for
in dramatic visual ambiance.

Academy Awards, Streep’s acting
abilities have not gone unnoticed. Her
film credits include Kramer vs. Kramer,
The Seduction of Joe Tynan, The
French Lieutenant’s Woman and
Sophie’s Choice. Similar to her role in

Krauthammer’s ideas and insights at
once bespeak a sophistication and
refinement of thought, combined with
the ability to relate them in a simple
(need I make the distinction between
simple and simplistic?) unclouded
manner. His viewpoints touch the
reader as through a gentle revelation,
almost echoing the ineffable thoughts
and sentiments that lie just at the tip
of the tongue. in other words, he
doesn’t, as so many other social com-
mentators do, bash you over the head
with his polemics. Rather, there is
much about Krauthammer’s writing

(even directing the transportation of
food across Africa in the midst of war),
though down deep she desires com-
panionship to the fullest. The irony is
that she spends her entire life, with the
exception of a few isolated moments,
alone. The relationship between them
is dramatic and intense, but just as it
reaches its peak, fate forbids it to grow.
In addition to the relationship be-
tween Blixen and Hatton, another type
of relationship adds to the feeling of
the movie. This is Blixen’s interdepen-
dence with the Kikuyu living on her
land. She works with them, educates
them, provides them with medical at-
tention and, in the end, assures their
safety. She also relies on their trust as
her friends, especially Farah, Blixen’s
loyal sidekick or major-domo. Out of
Africa shows how the native people live
and introduces many of their traditions
and differences to our largely ethno-
centric culture.

The scenery in Out of Africa is as-

toundingly lush and beautiful. The
numerous aerial shots allow one to see
Africa’s plains, streams and flocks and
herds as they travel across the land.
The cinematography took place near

Nairobi, Africa, bringing many strange .

and unique animals to the screen. Im-
agine the Wild Kingdom at its best, and
you can envision Out ofAfrica. Hatton
and Blixen explore this free land
together, fighting off lions, drinking
wine by the campfire and telling stories
in the traditional manner of Gilbert and
Sullivan.

The story in Out of Africa moves
slowly, paying attention ‘to details con-
cerning both the characters and the
environment. Out of Africa is the type
of movie that explores the land, the
characters and the natives of this
mysterious often feared place. In ad-
dition to being a movingly emotional
movie, Out of Africa is somewhat
educational in that it teaches and tells
us about Africa; but most of all, it is an
inspiring movie, worth each of its 150
minutes-

When I was a youngster in
Vermont, I used to go mountain
climbing with my grandfather.
We had a little treehouse near
the top of one mountain that was
our private hideaway. My grand-
father died some years ago, but
in his will he left me the key to
the treehouse. It is there that I
return each summer when I
travel to Vermont. Ikeep the key
on a chain around my neck, and
whenever I take it out and look
at it I think of my grandfather.
That is the theme of this week’s
Singles column.

The Art of Noise: Legs
Leave the kids alone in the recording
studio for five minutes, and what do
they do? In the case of Trevor Horn,
creation of musical mudpies is the
closest analogy. Sure, the state-o’-the-
art sheen is there, along with the
sampled vocals and assorted blip-
bloops set to a thudding beat, but
we’ve heard it all before. The trouble
is that Horn is a musical genius, no
doubt, but he’s been indoors too long.

According to Dave Marsh, the self-
appointed patron saint of rock critics,
a lot of people would do well to get a
good healthy dose of Springsteen’s

please tell me just exactly what the hell
is Springsteen’s vision of America?
No, don’t bother, on second thought.
l’m sure plenty of numbskulls would be
more than happy to inform me, at
length, that Springsteen is the only
honest man in the music business, that
he’s just brimming with integrity, that
he cares about the working man,
etc.,etc. Gimme a break. l’m sure that
Springsteen really does believe in what
he sings, but his integrity is the integri-
ty of ignorance. He’s just too dumb to
realize the kind of power and influence
that he has, and when he looks out in-
to the audience and sees the American
flags waving, he’s just dumb enough
to believe that the people waving them
have considered the implications as
much as he has, or that they all
understand the ironic undercurrents of
“Born in the U.S.A.” If he had enough
brains, he'd be terrified by what he’s
created. Instead he just sings sad
songs about They’re closing down the
textile mil// ’cross the railroad tracks. It
sure sounds nice, but as far as real
substance goes, forget it. l’m not say-
ing that all pop songs should have
substance, but the ones that claim to
had better deliver. Don’t misunder-
stand me. I think Bruce Springsteen is
a brilliant songwriter. But he can no
longer ignore the far-reaching
significance of his popularity or
misguided nationalism that has ac-
companied it. The longer he carries on,
the more he exposes his own
shallowness.

I don’t want to hear about your
hometown, Mr. Springsteen. I’d like to
hear you write about how you’re going
to deal with all these people waving the
flag, as much for Rambo as for you.

Jellybean: Sidewalk Talk

Famed mixmaster Jellybean Benitez
finally emerges into the spotlight, and
not a moment too soon. In this four-
minute burst of oh-so-cool urban ex-
citement, Benitez proves that he can

dance floor to vinyl without losing one
iota of beats-per-minute fun. Written,
ironically enough, by Madonna
(Benitez’s ex—fling), “Sidewalk Talk” is
a pulsating example of what ideal
dance music should be: the kind of
song that really inspires you to get up
and dance, not just generic thudding
to sway your hips to. l’m not sure that
I could take an album of this, but this
song, at least, is an unqualified winner.

Sade: The Sweetest Taboo

Sade and her band are threatening
to bring taste back to popular music.
(Come to think of it, it would be a first).
Fine with me. As a matter of fact, if a

' divine order came down from heaven

that all pop music had to sound the
same, I’d put in a request that it sound
like this. Shame that “Smooth Oper-
ator” got to be such a big hit, because
everyone got sick of it, and it really was
a great song. I hope I don’t get sick of
this one. The only word to describe it
is sexy.

Wham!: I 'm Your Man

Yes, yes, I hate Wham! In principle,
l’ve loathed all of their singles up until
now, and I would gladly wring George
Michae|’s stubbly little neck right now
if given the opportunity. But I must say,
albeit grudgingly, that this new 45 ain’t
too bad. Up until the chorus, sure, it’s
drivel. But that chorus  l’m sorry, it’s
catchy. l’m sorry. l’ve tried to ignore it.
I really have. But I find myself hum-
ming it in the elevator, on the bus, in
the shower. . . Maybe my intelligence
is draining away. I don’t know. But if
I like it, I like it. l’m sorry.

Years come; years go. Often one is just like another. But as 1985 came to an end, and our Arts and Leisure Survey
ballots came flooding in, the “best” and “worst” media giants of the year either toppled with great velocity or skyrocketed
to the stars. Thus, the question raised is: What motivates people to love and honor, or disregard in sickness and health
the beloved statues of success they so willingly championed? Why is Madonna suddenly a dirty old shoe? Did she disrobe
in front of too many heated young studs? Was she overexposed? Likewise, does Miami Vice truly get the media attention
it emphatically deserves? Would leisure suits become fashionable again if Don Johnson wore one in a Ferrari? Our opi-
nion is yes, but then again we would wear them regardless. lt’s one thing to be a trendsetter, and another to be a victim
of one; after all, no one could actually detest the “Material Girl” who bared it all in the name of art and gave every smiling
young stud a private tour of the virgin world. So whatever did happen to the dethroned Miss Vanessa? To be the best
implies that the person or thing captivated your psyche in one manner or another; to be the worst implies that you once
loved them or secretly keep their picture under your mattress and publicly denounce them in person. After all, one must
sincerely love, before he can obnoxiously despise. And alas, here’s our view of the year we rate as a 7 — good, but lack-

A lesson in musicianship from the master of discipline

By James Crary

I wait outside the pilgrims door with in-
sufficient schemes.

In the Court
King Crimson, ’69

Robert Fripp, musician turned
philosopher and former guitarist for
King Crimson, David Bowie, Peter
Gabriel and the Roches, now resides
in West Virginia in a farming communi-
ty, where he works on a book and en-
tertains students.

Keepers of the sacred (crackpot)
tradition of Gurdjieff, Ouspensky and
J.G. Bennett, the American Society for

Continuous Education, of which
Robert Fripp is president, continues an
easternstudy of disciplines involving
meditation, farm work, dance, reading
and, of course, music. The school is
accessible to anyone. Being of the
philosophical persuasion myself and
intrigued by the Frippian mode, I spent
two weekends with the ASCE in Clay-
mont Court.

The events of the first weekend were
so idiotic with the solemn ramblings of
the Gurdjieff disciples that they are too
embarrassing for me to recount. One
incident, however, almost redeems my
memory of those seven days. I had a
private audience with the director,
Pierre Eliot, a spritely septuagenarian

in the prime of health, who toured Asia _

with the indomitable Gurdjieff. Rather
plainly interested in a few psycho-
philosophical issues, I tried a few ques-
tions, of these I recall:

James: Pierre, can you tell me what
does it mean ‘to lie’?

Pierre: I wish you would ask me “what
does it mean “to not lie.’ ”

James: Exactly what does ASCE intend
with all their work?

Pierre: To bring about the flowering of
a new generation of brilliant
phﬂosophy.

Kind of evasive answers, true, but
colorful.

When I returned to Claymont, it was
to play, an invitation, music with Mr.
Fripp. The dream came true when l
was asked, with three other visitors, to
bring guitars to a small room overlook-
ing the apple orchard.

Picking up a guitar leaning on the
wall outside the room and receiving the
meditational moment (which precedes
all Claymont activities) with a real and
heartfelt commitment, I chose two
notes and began playing them in a
very complex rhythm. The song re-
sounded, transported our souls and
then soured. I’m not sure why it
soured.

Nevertheless, there is real music in
the work at Claymont. The magic spell
and sensitivity of Fripp’s craft and art
are very real. For me, the problems of
ASCE overwhelm the benefits, al-
though the music still plays in my
heart, from time to time flowering
again. . ’

Long Ryders:

Discovering America

~\

‘ /*

STATE OF OUR UNION
The Long Ryders
Island Records

With so much vapid neo-nationalism
being associated with American music,
The Long Ryders album State Of Our
Union stands out as a collection of u-
niquely American portraits that avoids
sentimental and sanctimonious trap-
pings. Armed with guitars, bass and
drums, plus a handful of folk in-
struments like the banjo, autoharp and
lap steel, The Long Ryders play sim-
ple country & western-tinged rock that
accentuates, above all, the lyrics Sid
Griffin and Stephen McCarthy warble,
yelp and sing. The band’s songs ex-
amine life with so much unpreten-
tiousness and authenticity, it’s hard not
to recognize people, places and emo-
tions and marvel at The Long Ryders’
talents for relating their observations
musically.

' A chugging major chord progression
and wolf-like howl kick off “Looking
For Lewis and Clark,”a strongly ironic
consideration of the search for
American values that appears first on
the album. While Tim Hardin searches
in heaven and others look in Johan-
nesburg, the singer claims, I thought
I saw my president walkin’ in Harlem

Growing up in
the White City

WHITE CITY: A ‘NOVEL
Pete Townshend
Atco Records

If you’re looking for a Who revival in
Pete Townshend’s latest solo album,
White City: A Novel, you can end your
search with this sentence. White City
formally surrenders the windmill-
armed, chord-bashing, guitar-

, smashing Pete Townshend of old and

   
 

Who. The anger and frustration whch

accepts the present and the future with
a certain degree of optimism.

This album is as much a departure
from his previous solo albums as it is
a farewell to younger days with the

surfaced on Empty Glass and All The
Best Cowboys is no longer evident.
What drives this album are emotions

- in check and creative energies in con-

'-A

trol. in a word, this album embodies
something called maturity.

Since splitting from the band and
curing a drug habit, Townshend has
found himself a workaday job as an
editor for a publishing house and
broken the middle-age barrier at 40.
White City thrives on the stability of this
new identity but does not become
passive in excess of comfort. What is
missing in youthful exuberance is
made. upxfor by a refined sensitivity.

later after dark. Traditional family ex-
pectations get treated too, as a white
lawyer-to-be shocks his father by
becoming a musician —— his motivation
comes from the Negro musicof Mem-
phis AM station WDIA.

Detailed, sympathetic character
sketches abound. Byrds-like vocal har-
monies detail a woman’s work to sup-
port her husband whose farm’s soil
has turned to sand in “Two Kinds Of
Love.” A newly-released convict con-
siders the murder he commited 16
years ago and suffers a slow death in-
side while looking out at the “Lights Of
Downtown.” A young woman search-

-es for a man amongst the St.

Christopher-guided soldiers just
returned from “Capturing The Flag.”
While other songs, like -“Here

Comes That Train Again” and “State
Of My Union,” recall rich experiences
of boyhood, they never turn maudlin.
The lyric of “Years Long Ago” may
best explain the band’s view of the
past: while a ticking clock percussion
reminds us that time never, stops, the
words say looking back is fine, but we
need more to face changes and assure
tomorrow (isn’t) incidental.

Possibly the biggest irony surround-S
-ing The Long Ryders is that their

undeniably American sound first

“Give Blood” begins the album with
an emotion-packed plea for modera-
tion. “Brilliant Blues” has some nice
vocal harmonies reminiscent of days
gone by. if you can get past-the drums,
“Face The Face” is carried by some
jazzy piano and string bass with big
band horns for flavor. It’s also got a
steaming little harmonica solo. “Hiding
Out” is a pleasant percussive tune
with a rolling guitar rhythm and a dash
of woodwind. Along with ‘‘I Am
Secure,” these two songs are con-
templative of the realities which are
part of Townshend’s present environ-
ment. in ‘‘I Am Secure” an accoustic
guitar melody sets up the perfect tem-
po for Townshend’s most confident yet
relaxed vocals. “Secondhand Love” is
built over some bluesy piano with bass
in sympathy and calls for honesty in
relationships. “Crashing By Design”
and “White City Fighting” contain the
album’s only standout guitar perform-
ances, while the rest of the album sees
the guitar in a more textural context.
“Come To Mama” is a piano-based
song with some majestic horn work
that reminds one of Quadrophenia.

White City is an inspired album by a
man who has seen and realized the
course of his life. Living in the present
after learning from the past provides
hopeful insights to the future. As he
says in “Crashing By Design,” Nothing
must pass this line/Unless it is well
defined.

RAH! RAH!

MYSTERY
The Rah Band
RCA Records

Imagine this: Debbie Harry’s calm,
expressionless crooning behind

Sade’s nondescript band, as they at- V

gained ‘acceptance in Europe and is
only now earning the band a wider
U.S. audience. The Long Ryders cer-
tainly deserve the recognition they’re
now receiving. State Of Our Union pro-
vides ample proof of this group’s talent
in realistically picturing our nation and
detailing its peoples’ hardships (“You
Just Can’t Ride The Boxcars

tempt to play colorless coffeehouse-
type melodies disguised as jazz
sophistication. Add a little funk and a
little WAMO-blasting synthesizer and
you’ve got the Rah Band, an
undeniably distraught group of musi-
cians fronted by a woman known only
as Dizzy Lizzy whose back-up ensem-
ble is named, I’d guess rather ap-
propriately, the Rah La La’s.

The problem with the Rah Band’s
Mystery is that it’s not very enticing.
Through six songs, lead singer Dizzy
Lizzy’s voice fails to generate any
sparks and does not fluctuate at all.
Even when she aims for the higher
notes, as in “Sorry Doesn’t Make It
Anymore,” her delivery is trapped
along a horizon line of faltering emo-
tion. Her lack of diversification is a
steady flaw, sustained throughout
Mystery almost as if there was a pur-
pose to her lackadaisical outlook.

But it’s not entirely her fault. Blame
the failures, also, on the band
members. Both of the album’s in-
strumentals (“Float” and “Out on the
Edge”) are catastrophes, nihilistic
melodies that glide along tediously to
no man’s land. Keyboards and synthe-
sizers border on the sumbliminal;
horns and a saxophone blast here and
there, but don’t really belong in the
context of the Rah Band at all. It seems
like band members are trying to out-
perform each other; Richard Hewson’s
production is lackluster and murky;
and the results are unfortunate.

Mystery does, however, tend to af-
fect your senses. When Dizzy Lizzy
sings in “Clouds Across The Moon,”
I've had a million lovers on the
phone/But I just stay right here at
home, you want to give her a good
swift kick in the guts just to get some
emotion out of her. It’s one of the bet-
ter cuts; it’s propelled by synthesizer
attacks straight from Star Wars, so
spacey you begin looking around the
room for Chewbacca. And “Mystery
Boy,” however cliche-rid__den,, actually

Anymore”) and triumphs (“Good Times
Tomorrow, Hard Times Today”) with
vitality, sincerity and an entirely
original vision. The Long Ryder’s
Union proves one_well worth

JOHN YOUNG

has somewhat of a beat. Lizzy’s per-
formance, though, drags along like a
broken-down tractor, and proves to be
the major flaw with Mystery. That is,

Probably best known for their-.

featured versions of pop classics like

“Born on the Bayou” and “Homeward

assault on their latest and last album,
Shockabilly Heaven. With twisted,

tongue-in-cheek remakes of “lnstant

Karma” and Marc Bo|an’s “Life’s A
Gas,” Shockabilly clearly
demonstrates that the cover in the
hands of such eminently ironic eccen-
trics becomes lethal pop reinterpreta-
tion. Consequently, the original ver-
sions end up never sounding or mean-
ing quite what they once did before be-
ing stained and skinned by Shockabil-
ly’s avant-punk cleverness.

Even more striking and iconoclastic
than the pop mutations on Shocl<abil-
ly Heaven are the originals, particulary
those penned by guitarist and head ec-

centric Eugene Chadbourne. “Hendrix
Buried in Tacoma,” with its obscure,
lonely images of American mobility
and first rock concerts, earns its ever-
so-palatable nostalgia via Chad-
bourne’s wistful voice and beautiful
picking. “How Can You Kill Me When
I’m Already Dead,” which combines
screamed and chanted Manson
quotes with industrial strength, dread-
drenched feedback, is his homage to
alternative music’s favorite psycho
guru. “Vampire Tiger Girl Strikes
Again,” may be the high point of a
great album, shows Chadbourne at his
idiom-stumbling, absurdist best, boun-
cing along the parameters of bub-
blegum skiffle, heavy metal and

psychedelia only to engulf everyone
within earshot in a binding gob of
whimsy.

Drummer David Licht and
bassist/producer Kramer provide a
compatibly angular rhythm section for
Chadbourne’s zigzag vocals and
schizoid guitar. In addition to their
novel approach to the trio, Shockabi|-
ly uses extra-musical sound
throughout the album. Swirling in,
around and between these wonderful
ditties are fragments from television
shows and commercials, phone con-
versations and various other sound ef-
fects, helping to make this album a
very playful, interesting and dense

‘hunk of art.

Raw Power is an Italian-based
underground band currently touring
America. Their name truly defines the
intensity of the music they play. The
band features David, probably the best
hardcore guitarist in the world today.
Because of him, they are what is
known as a heavy metal speedcore

SST Records really struck out by
signing up unique heavy metal band
called Saint Vitius. Like most metal
bands, Saint Vitius waves a Christian
cross and tells fairy tale prophecies
similar only to those in a “He—Man”

native music lover to sleep. Put a big

BYO is now offering America a taste
of one of Germany’s finest hardcore
bands Upright Citizens. The LP, Open
Ears, Open Eyes, Brains to Think and
a Mouth to Speak is a compilation of
material previously released by the

band across the sea. My biggest disap— g

pointment here is the band’s constant
preoccupation with the government flu,
which we’ve already heard from too
many American bands. But none-
theless, Upright Citizens have in-
vented yet another psych/rocklcore fu-

Cosi Fan Tutti: Mozart’s classic comes to Heinz Hall

By David Zuchowski

If those post-prandial holiday blahs
got you down, brighten up your day by
attending one of this week’s classical
music extravaganzas. Cozy up to Cosi
(Fan Tutti), Mozart’s comic opera about
the fickleness of women. The opera,
loosely translated as ‘‘All Women Are
Like That,” is set in 18th century
Naples and stars Irish soprano
Suzanne Murphy. Murphy made her
U.S. debut in November in the title role
of Norma at the New York City Opera.
She frequently performs with the
English National Opera and EngIand’s
Opera North and is featured on the
soundtrack album of the movie
Amadeus. Rounding out the cast will
be mezzo-soprano Sheryl Woods,

Welcome back, readers. Yeah, I
know I missed last week’s Showcase,
but I was unavoidably detained in
Florida. The big question, however, is:
Did you know that I missed last week’s
Showcase? Well, if you did or not,
we’re all back here at Pitt for another
semester of enlightenment.

So, how were the holidays? Let’s
start with Christmas. Have a nice time
seeing relatives 24 hours a day? How
about all your little cousins running all
over the place, getting into your stuff?
Then there are the dreaded fruitcakes
— why do people send other people a
12-lb. cake that will never be con-
sumed? I wouldn’t consider it a very
nice gestureof holiday spirit if I found
my mailbox all dented up because
some joker stuck a fruitcake in it.

baritone Richard Cross.

Although Cosi is one of America’s
most frequently performed operas, this
will be only the second production in
the 46-year history. Performances are
scheduled at Heinz Hall on Jan. 16, 18
and 21. Student tickets are available
one-half hour before the performance
for as little as $4.

Also scheduled for this week is
pianist Catherine Kautsky performing
Sunday, Jan. 19 at 8 P.M. at the Mor-
ris Kaufmann Auditorium, 315 'S.
Bellefield Ave., Oakland as part of the
Y Music Society’s Recital Series. Kaut-
sky studied and performed extensive-
ly in New York before moving to Pitts-
sburgh last year. She received a
master’s from Julliard where she

But let’s get to the bottom line.
How’d you make out? You know that
when you ask someone what presents
they got, they always say, “Oh, I got
some clothes and money, you know,
the usual stuff.” Well, that’s just a great
response, people. I know what you got,
and you’re too scared to say what you
got because you know that it’s the
same stuff that everyone else got too.
Girls got:

stirrup pants

floral Forenza jeans

exercise equipment (that will get tons
of use)

Guys got:
sweaters

funny underwear from their girlfriends
a dumb shirt from an aunt

Kautsky says of Makrokosmos,
“People who are usually suspicious of
contemporary music most often like
the composition,” which, she adds, “is
religious in an almost primitive man-
ner.” The piece, which is divided into
12 parts (each devoted to one of the
zodiacal signs), has magical properties
that create a dream or seance-like
situation. The piece also calls for the
performer to hum, whistle and chant
Latin words in accompaniment to the
piano, which, in addition to being
played in the usual manner, is acted
upon internally by external implements
such as thimbles, a small chain and a
plectrum to produce pizzicato, harp-
like effects and other variations in tim-
bre and tone.

“And the colored girls sing d0-tall-do-tah-do 

By Carrie Stetler

Until recently, black musicians have
been conspicuous only‘ in their
absence on MTV. If you recall, it was
only two years ago that MTV program-
mers — who were probably shamed
and embarrassed by noisy cries of
“racism” — eased up on their
segregational format and aired
Michael Jackson’s “Beat it.” The
positive response to this less-than-
shocking PR move eventually
prompted MTV’s demographics de-
partment to sit up and note that hordes
of white, middle class teenagers not
only bought the Thriller after seeing the
video, but, in some instances, would
even pay for something as progressive
as a rap single if they merely heard it
on AM radio. Thus, pollsters concluded
that it was safe to show a- Chaka Kahn
video without fear of their target au-
dience fleeing the living room as soon
as they caught a glimpse of some top-
40 funkster in between videos by Dok-
ken and a-ha. Since then, young
suburbanites have stayed tuned for
other black artists, and now, even Flun
DmC and Afrika Bambaata enjoy a lit-
tle light-to-medium rotation on MTV.

So, the time has passed for critics
to rail against MTV’s pop apartheid.
However, some mention should be
given to the seemingly trivial, but
nonetheless disturbing, examples of
racism or racial stereotyping that oc-
cur in the videos of “eclectic” white
rock stars employing black back-up
vocalists (usually women) as exotic
props or accessories. Even if you’re
not an habitual MTV view, you’ve no
doubt seen videos by the likes of Paul
Young, Howard Jones and Pete
Townshend which briefly feature three
black female back-up singers, attired

in tight satin dresses or vaguely
African hats, swaying their ample hips
in front of the horn section and occas-
sionally joining the “star” of the video
for a soulful chorus or two. The looks
of these women recall about three
stereotypical images: third world earth
mothers (if they are wearing African
headdress), buxom blues singersl(if
they are wearing tight dresses), or
highly choreographed Motown trios,
such as the Supremes or the
Vandellas (if they are thin and dance
together at the same time). The sound
of these women, if indeed their real
voices are used at all (in some videos
they’re not), is meant to add a dash of

, authentic R & B to the songs of per-

formers who obviously doubt their own
ability to sustain a convincing mood
without the help of someone wailing
like Aretha Franklin in the background.

I’m not necessarily knocking the ef-
forts of white performers to imitate, or
collaborate with black performers they
admire, or (as they so often tell us) that
have been a great influence on them.
The attempts of some white rock musi-
cians to “expose” their audience to
funk, rap or blues, by synthesizing
their style of music with the sort of rock
that gets more airplay have yielded
some inspired and exciting results.
When David Byrne, for instance, is
backed by gospel singers on a song
like “Slippery People,” it probably is
correct to assume that he sang with
them for reasons more creative than
the need to flaunt his street credibility
or his knowledge and appreciation of
“black music.” When Simple Minds,

on the other hand, feature a black .

woman singer who belts out a brief aria
of “soulful” moaning to connote a
mood of enobled suffering in “Alive

and Kicking,’ the discriminating
listener should be a little wary.

In such instances, we are faced with ,

the century-old ethical dilemma of
white musicians stealing, borrowing or
transforming what are commonly
known as black forms of music for their
own ends. |’ve heard this debate. so
many times before, (and probably so
have you) that it would be tiresome for
me to repeat it and tiresome for you to
read. Related to this problem, how-

ever, is an uncomfortable (possibly

racist) assumption that I find myself
making: that black entertainers some-
times are used as a “commodity” in
the white entertainment world —— that
they can be hired to perform what
amounts to as the menial labor of the
music business: back-up singing.

_Is it fair of me to speak of black per-
formers in this way? After all, back-up
singing is a skill, not a craft. Back-up
vocalists generally don’t write their
own songs. They probably don’t even
have the liberty to sing their assigned
pieces as they’d like to sing them.
They simply are paid to lend their own
voices to other people’s music the way
other people want them to. So really,
in terms of the freedom that creativity
allows, no black or white back-up
singer’s talents go unexploited. They

make a career out of letting other art- -

ists exploit their voice as if it were an
instrument.

Recently, however, at least in pop
music, the use of black voices in
“white” songs seems increasingly
superficial. I don’t think contemporary
pop stars are giving much though as
to why they want a soulful chorus here
or a gospel moan there. lt’s as if they
whipped up a potential hit single, found
something lacking and said, “Hmm 

Showcase, January 17, 1986

  

there’s something a little bland about
my song. It doesn't have enough pas-
sion, enough texture. Why don’t I call
up those girls who sang with Mick Jag-
ger a few years ago?”

In yet another example of this sort
of musical tokenism, a black male

“vocal group,” with stage movements '

similar to the Spinners or the Tempta-
tions, were shown on an MTV video
singing a song called ‘‘I Can Dream
About You,” a “b|ue-eyed soul” piece
actually performed by a white singer
named Dan Hartman — who didn’t
even appear in the video. Obviously,
the black performers were used for
their more interesting stage presence
and their choreography rather than
their voices.

It seems a shame that MTV airs this _
sort of pantomime, but refuses to show 3

videos, like those on the Black Enter-
tainment network, where black vocal
groups perform their own songs, wear
clothing of their choice and basically’
look, sound and move the way they
want to, rather than conforming to
some outmoded image of the Soul
Singer as perpetuated by MTV. Pro-
bably Annie Lennox (who, to her credit,
has done a duet with Aretha Franklin),
and other pop artists, don’t realize that
often, when they feature black enter-
tainers on their albums or videos,
they’re contributing to a stereotype of
black singers and performers. I’m not
really sure how detrimental this is. Cer-
tainly, there’s no real harm done, and

everyone sounds pretty. It seems,

though, that a little respect is general-
ly lacking in some white performers’
regard of contemporary black singers
and current black music. ironically,
respect, in one form or another, is so
often the subject of these pop singers’
lyrics.

The Panther wrestling team con-

i*‘- tinued its bid to break into the Top

20 rankings with a 24-19 victory
over Lock Haven University. The
Bald Eagles became Pitt’s latest
victim as the Panthers raised their
dual meet record to 3-0-1, but more
importantly, they’re now 2-0 in the
Eastern Wrestling League. _

“This wasn’t our best perform-
ance, but I still think we deserve to
be rated,” said Coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer. “ With this win, I’m pret-
ty sure we will be.”

Things started off slow for the
Panthers, who fell behind 6-0. In
the second match, the nation’s No.
2 rated l26—pounder Matt Avery
(22—5—l) narrowly defeated Pitt’s
John Hnath, 3-2, dropping the
senior to 19-5 for the year.

Despite a win for Avery. it was
a very hard-fought battle. "He’s

. [Hnath] a pretty tough guy," said
Avery. “He doesn‘t make many

' mistakes. and he doesn’t allow you
to score points.”

As for Hnath, he feels Avery is
worthy of his ranking. “He’s
beaten several tough kids this year,
so he deserves it, but rankings don’t
matter until the end of the year.

“I wrestled his match. IfI had
stuck to my stuff, the outcome
could easily have been different.”

In the next bout, teammate Kyle
Nellis got things rolling with a 13-5
superior decision, closing the gap
to 6-4. Following Nellis, the Pan-
thers got back—to-back pins from
freshman Pat Santoro and senior
Joe Bond. For Santoro, his record

Pitt wrestlers slam Lock Haven

Pitt’s Pat Santoro raised his record to 17-4 last night, pinning Lock Haven’s Mike
Lingenfelter in the first period.

is now an impressive 17-4.

The Panthers added four points
to make the score 20-6 when Doug
Haines won a superior decision 8-0.
Lock Haven tried to mount a come-
back, and after Eric Wertz, EWL
Wrestler of the Week, was
technically failed by Lock Haven’s
Brad Lloyd, the Panther lead slip-
ped to 20-12.

Panthers Mike Tongel and Cur-
tis Conner were not ready to allow
the match to escape and fought off
their opponents, battling to draws.

First, Tongel fell behind on a
takedown to Greg Wykoff, who
entered the match ranked among
the nation’s best at 177 lbs. The
determined sophomore gained a
reversal and hung on to save a tie.

Curtis Conner’s draw was a lit-
tle more dramatic. After finding
himself up 5-4 with 24 seconds left,
his opponent, Bill Freeman, re-
versed Conner with less than 10
seconds to go. Conner then, with
just six ticks of the clock remain-
ing, blasted out from the bottom

position to earn a tie and save the
' victory for the Panthers.

“The two ties were definitely a
big difference in the match,” said
Stottlemyer. “But it was the pin
from Bond that really changed the
momentum in the match.”

The Panthers will next take on
Division II opponent Ashland Col-
lege, Saturday at Trees Hall, who
are ranked fifth in the country.
“[Ashland] is very young, and
they'll be good competition for our
guys,” commented Stottlemyer.

Villanova next

Panthers aim

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The Big East. It’s arguably the best
conference in the nation. The competi-
tion is fierce and it gets tougher with
every passing game. The Pitt Panthers
are experiencing just how tough it can
be for them. Having made a number
of changes and adjustments, it still has
been difficultfor Roy Chipman and his
kids.

Right now, the Panthers find
themselves working to get back on the
track that saw them beat
Georgetown and take St. John‘s to
overtime. The Panthers are hoping to
leave behind the bad habits that have
troubled them as of late. Pitt has not
played well since that heartbreaking
loss in New York. though they've won
two of their last three.

The Panthers find themselves stuck
in neutral and they need a change of
gear before they lose control. Pitt will
enter tomorrow‘s game against the
defending National Champions, the
Villanova Wildcats, with hopes of
shifting back into a more comfortable
gear.

So far this season the Panthers are

Times sure have changed for Rollie
Massimino’s ‘Cats. as they stand at a
disappointing 1 1-7 on the year.
However, the Big East has made a dif-

ference so far for Villanova, as they’ve
won three of four conference games to
date. ‘

The Panthers are having problems
getting their game to gel both offen-
sively and defensively. Charles Smith
has been struggling for several games
and the team has played sluggishly,
though Demetreus Gore and Curtis
Aiken have picked up the slack.

Tuesday night, Smith was able to
bounce back by scoring 23 points, col-
lecting nine rebounds and blocking five
shots. Gore scored 20 more, but turned
the ball over eight times. including four
costly turnovers late in the second half.
The Panthers‘ play was sloppy and Pitt
was out rebounded 39-30 by a smaller
opponent, escaping with a narrow
71-70 victory despite a disappointing
performance.

"We haven’t out rebounded anyone
since getting back into the Big East
[conference playl,“ said Chipman.
"and it bothers me a lot.

"We were relieved to be home. but
I'm concerned by the poor perfor-
mance. We‘re going on the road again
and we better give a lot better perfor-
mance against Villanova than we did

[against Providence] to win on the

road.”

What about another road game‘? Un-
til Tuesday, the Panthers hadn’t played
in the Field House since Dec. 21,
against Florida State. Now they must
go back on the road again to face a

tougher opponent in Villanova at the
Palestra in Philadelphia. where they’re
awfully tough to beat.

“Coming home was nice,” said
Gore. “We needed a win to be ready
to win there [Vil1anova].”

Senior Darryl Shepherd was quite
clear as to his thoughts on Pitt travel-
ing once again. “I think most players
have been [traveling] for some time
now and they know what it’s like on
the road. There’s no excuse for us not
playing good when we’re not at home.
We do need to learn to control the
games better so we’re not tired.
Sometimes we get into lapses and we
can’t have that.”

To combat such lapses Chipman has
preached Pitt‘s need to get the ball in-
side. especially to Smith. Against Pro-
vidence. the Panthers had improved
success and relied less on perimeter
jump shots. In all, the Panthers got five
dunks and other easy baskets down
low, with Smith getting his eight field
goals in the “paint" area.

“We were looking for Charles in-
side." said point guard Joey David. "I

told him to keep looking for it and it - '

worked well. It‘s a step in the right
direction."

“It felt good to be freed up as they
played more one-on-one." said Smith.
"I‘ve-got to learn to expect being
double teamed and it won’t be any
easier on the road. I just need to be

Pitt showed that it has one of the
finest women’s swim teams in the
country by beating high-ranked Penn
State last Saturday afternoon in State
College, Pa.

There were many obstacles that
could have worked against the Pan-
thers' pulling out a victory over the
Lady Nittany Lions. First, the meet
was on the road and Pitt was in un-
familiar surroundings. Second. Penn
State has a top—llight women‘s swim

' team with many top competitors. Final-

ly, Pitt has been undefeated for two
consecutive years and the possibility of
being “ripe:‘ for an upset was con-
ceivable.

The outcome illustrated the Lady
Panthers’ character and quality. Pitt
challenged the best, and won.

After the Penn State win, head coach

-David Belowich said enthusiastical-

ly,"I think we can build upon this to
have a great Big East season."
Before Pitt can begin their “Big East
season,” they must take care of the
next team on their schedule: Clarion.
The quality of Clarion‘s Division II
program may not be equal to that of
highly ranked Division I programs,
but, according to Belowich, Clarion is

As I see it

The Pitt News. January 17. 1986

By Jim Brueckner

Athletes you’ll never read about

Have you ever heard of Babe
Didrikson? She was, without a doubt,
the finest female athlete that the world
has ever known. Yet when her name
is mentioned. it usually is greeted with
a puzzled look or an “I’ve heard of
her.” _

For those of you who’ve been denied
the knowledge of Babe’s exploits,
here’s the simple truth. She entered 634
amateur events and won 632. These
took place in basketball, track. swim-
ming and billiards. Later in life. she
happened to “take up" golf. which
proved to be more than just a hobby.
as she went on to win an unprecedented
16 consecutive tournaments.

Female athletes have always had
trouble grabbing the headlines. Even
today it takes athletes the caliber of
Mary Lou Retton and Martina
Navratilova to bump the men from the
spotlight.

But on the other hand. not only does
one have to be male. but he must com-
pete in a “glamour" sport in the right
city and at the right time to getinoticed.

A few weeks ago. Joe Namath ad-
dressed the fact that this exists in foot-
ball. while he was appearing on “Larry
King Live" on the Cable News Net-
work. He said that he felt Archie Man-
ning was one of the finest quarterbacks.
yet Manning will never make the Hall
of Fame because he played for the low-
ly New Orleans Saints during his
prime.

Unsung heroes have a long history
in sports. The following is a collection
of some of the most spectacular
physical achievements in history. but
they are known by less than one per-

cent of the public.

0 Brute Strength I: In 1955. Swiss
strongman Oswald Fohn threw a
l83—lb. boulder a distance of 9-5.

0 Brute Strength II: Canadian Louis
Cyr only lifted 545—pounds a few in-
ches off the ground —— but he did it with
one finger. ’

0 Brute Strength III: In ancient
Greece, a wrestler named Milo threw
a 300—lb. man a distance of 20 feet.

0 Golfer Charles Boswell shot an 81
over 18 holes. That’s pretty impressive
for a blind golfer!

0 John G. Guilford once bowled nine
consecutive strikes. and he, too. is
completely blind.

0 The incredible achievement for a
blind athlete was that of Norwegian
Gunnar Erikson. however. The
ultimate cross—country skier. Erikson
skiied from Fauske to Valdres — a
distance of 806 miles.

0 If you are impressed by how soon
Dwight Gooden has achieved the
20—win season. then what about bowler
David Quinn‘? After bowling only three

months, he bowled a 300—game in.

league competition.

0 William Bolton decided. at age 70.
to walk to stay in shape. But he got a
little carried away as he hiked 400. yes
400 miles. 10 times each year until his
death at age 80.

0 Modern athletes have far superior

training facilities than the athletes of“

100 years ago. In 1876. a Pawnee In-
dian named Koo—Tah-We-Cots-Oo—Lel—
‘ E—Hoo—La—Shar ran the mile in 3:58,
which was not equalled until 1954. His
record withstood almost 80 years of
technological improvement in training.

0 In 1933, Jimmy Nichols, a one-
armed golfer, made a 336—yard
hole—in-one!

°Dr. Victor Reinders was the

greatest marksman who ever lived. Isf3,_

tournament play. he broke 120,317 out
of a possible 122.700 clay pigeons —
better than 98 percent.

0 Stefan Steinberger walked 42 miles
non—stop from his home in Bavaria to
St. Gilgen. Austria. He must not have
thought that he had gotten quite enough
exercise because he then continued on
to climb the 5900—foot Schafberg
Mountain.

0 Let me state my agreement that the
“glamour" sports should get a large

majority of the attention in the niedia.»-1

But they shouldn‘t get 100 percent of ‘
it. There are many sports that The
Sporﬁng News‘ (the best sports publica-
tion in the world) totally ignores. And
athletes in these “other" sports should
not have to reach the levels of the
above—mentioned athletes to get a small
dose of recognition. ‘

St. John’s squeaks by Lady Panthers

By John Enright
Staff Writer

The situation was exactly what head
coach Kirk Bruce and his Lady Panthers
wanted against St. John’s on Wednesday
night at the Fitzgerald Field House. Kim
Gannis. Pitt‘s leading scorer, was at the
foul line for a one—and-one with four
seconds left in the game and her team
down by one point. 55-54.

The Lady Panthers had fought hard all
night. diving for loose balls. grabbing key
rebounds and making clutch shots. Now.
they were right where they wanted to be.
But there was one problem — the ball
didn’t go in the basket. Gannis missed the
free throw as the Lady Panthers suffered
their third consecutive Big East loss.

“I really feel, all in all, they [Pitt]
played the game like I wanted them to
play,” said Bruce. “We didn’t want to
get in a run-and-gun battle with St.
John’s, and we didn’t. We played good
defense tonight and defense is what wins
ballgames. But, it just didn’t work out.
I’m not satisﬁed we lost, but I was
satisfied with the effort.”

The loss dropped the Lady Panthers to

2-4 in Big East play and 6-7 overall. St.
John’s improved their season mark to
10-4 while climbing to 5-1 in the league.

Pitt had an early 11-7 first—half lead,
but St. John‘s went on a 12-2 run to take
a six-point lead with 6:30 left in the half.
The Lady Panthers could not regain the
lead and were very fortunate to go into
the _half with only a 30-27 deficit con-
sidering they shot a dismal .367 from the
field.

After intermission. Pitt grabbed a
38-37 lead. only to see St. John‘s go on
another scoring spurt. This 13-5 spree
gave St. John‘s a seven—point advantage
with a little over four minutes remaining.

Pitt fought back and cut the lead to
55-54 with 43 seconds left on a three-
point play by guard Kim Tirik. The Lady
Panthers then rebounded a St. John's
miss with 19 seconds to go and called
time to set up a play. They worked the
ball inside and missed a shot, but Gan-
nis was fouled on the rebound attempt,
sending her to the line for a chance to win
the game. But it wasn’t meant to be for
Pitt. Gannis’ shot hit the back of the rim.
and St. John’s pulled down the rebound
to preserve the victory.

P’ tt

The Lady Panthers were led in scoring
by Gannis with 14 points, while Tyner
and Tirik each chipped in with 11. St.
John’s placed four players in double
ﬁgures, led byguard Jackie Smith with
13 points.

Tomorrow. the Lady Panthers travel
to Storrs. Conn. to take on the Huskies.
Bruce said he knows it will be a tough
game: “They’re [University ofConnec-
ticut] thetype of team that you can't relax
on. You have to go out and play your
heart out to beat them. They‘re not play-
ing real well. but l’lI tell you what —
anytime you play in somebody else‘s
gym. you better be prepared to play and
play hard."

NOTES: Forward Sally Sheerer had
10 rebounds for Pitt  Freshmen for-
ward Tabatha Long was impressive.
Despite scoring only four points. Long
was aggressive on the boards and should

vie for more playing time in the future '

Pitt Invite
Saturday

By Roy Bigler
The Pitt News

The men’s and women's track teams
will be attending a total of three dif-
ferent meets this weekend. The women
will be attending the Michigan Relays
at Ann Arbor. Mich. on Friday, while
the men will be splitting into two dif-
ferent groups. On Saturday. one crew
will be at the East Tennessee State
University Kodak Invitational, and the
other will be staying in Oakland to host
the Pitt Invitational.

There will be a full team going to
Michigan and the Pitt Invitational,
while only five of the men will be go-
ing to east Tennessee. Pitt will only be
competing in two events at the Kodak
Invitational. Lee McRae will be com-
peting in the 60-meter dash, and Bob
Weiner, Rodney Giles, David Moore
and Tim Manes will be competing in
the two-mile relay.

Coach John Vasvary is hoping that
his men will do well in competition

Lady Panthers host Clarion

continued from page 17

"the best Division II team in the coun-
try. They are well—eoaehed and well-
prepared.“

Clarion will counter Pitt‘s strong at-
tack with Tina Bair. an All-America
who swims the sprints. Other

challenges will be made by Elisa

Woicicki, also in the sprints, and highly
recruited Terry Messenger. Among
common opponents, Clarion has lost to
Penn State, 75-65.

Belowich reiterated Pitt’s feelings
toward Clarion by saying,“Everbody
knows that they are a good Division II
school. No one is taking them lightly.”

For Pitt. the meet haslmore than a
win—or-lose value. This meet is the last
home meet before the Big East Cham-
pionships. All of the swimmers want
the seniors to finish their final regular

Cha Palla The Pitt News

Pitt will try to run away from the competition this
Saturday at the Pitt Invitational.

during both ofthe meets. He is hoping
that McRae and the two—mile relay
team will qualify for the Nationals, or,
at least, come away with a personal
best.

As for the group that is staying
behind to host the Pitt Invitational,
Vasvary said he is hoping that the mere
idea of being at home will help them
relax and case any pressure they are
feeling. Overall, Vasvary said he hopes
his men will have a chance to develop
themselves further this weekend in an
attempt to strength their overall perfor-

season meet on a winning note.

Next week. Pitt will take on high-
ranked WVU in Morgantown.
Belowich thinks the meet with Clarion
will provide less stress for the Panthers.
"It’s nice to have not as much pressure
because next week we have another
meet,” commented Belowich.

If Pitt is to ready for a tension-ﬁlled
contest against WVU, then they must

mance for the future.

Steve Lewis, the head coach of the
women’s team, also is hopeful that his
team will show an improvement in their
performance. The meet will ,feature
relays which should offer the women
a slight conﬁdence builder, since this
will suit the overall strength of the
team. Lewis will be using this meet to
develop further the abilities of his
women so that they will be able to com-
pete on a much broader basis, to
become a strong challenger on a divi-
sional level.

continue the special teamwork. “We
have to keep doing what we have been
doing if we want to win,” Belowich
said.

Notes: The Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team also gets back into action
this weekend with home meets against
LaSalle (tonight at 7:30) and Penn State
(Saturday at 4 p.m.). Both meets are
at Trees Pool.
