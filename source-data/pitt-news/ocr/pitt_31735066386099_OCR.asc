Witnesses at the scene of the accident, which
occurred at approximately 5 p.m., said that a blue
Chevrolet turning left from Bellefield Avenue onto
Fifth Avenue struck a gray Suburu heading southwest
down Fifth Avenue. _

The blue Chevrolet struck a female pedestrian and
carried her along with the car until it pinnedher to a
tree on the lawn in front of the Music Building. The
Suburu spun into a pole on the same corner but did
not hit any other passersby.

The identity of the female pedestrian has not been
released pending notification of kin, but there has
been speculation that she may be a Pitt student.
Sources at Presbyterian-University Hospital would
not reveal the extent of her injuries, but conﬁrmed

around, there was just a crunch l...l you want to help,

She said that two unidentified male passersby
aided the accident victims until paramedics arrived.

The cause of the accident was not immediately
known, but Raymond Hawkins, a passenger in the

Chevy, Joseph Goodwin, might have suffered a slight
heartattack which caused him to lose control of his
vehicle. Anthony Porter, a witness who had been

Student Health Service provides Variety of medical care

By Randy Legersky
Stajf Writer

For their $46 fee each term,
Student Health Service aims to
treat and educate university
students in every aspect related
to health care_, according Frank
Carter, SHS director.

SHS has three locations and
branches on the Pitt campus.
The main office is at 204
Brackenridge Hall, where both
walk-in and appointment services
can be received. There one could
be treated for allegeries, have lab
work done, be x—rayed for minor
injuries, relieved of an upper

respitory infection or calmed of a
gastric upset, to name a few of’ the
office’s services. 0

“We see the full gambit of
diseases, although upper-
respitory infections are probably
most common," said Carter.

Screenings are conducted by
nurses for walk-in patients in order
to find out more about the patient’s
backgound and medical needs.
Patients then will either see a
doctor on staff, or be scheduled
for an appointment with one of
the contract doctors hired by SHS,
such as the dermatologist.

SHS served nearly 40,000
patients in 1989, said Carter.

The Brackenridge office also
houses a pharmacy, managed by
Joe Mance, where students can
have their prescription needs
filled.

“Many pharmacy majors work
for a time in our pharmacy," said
Carter.

Housed in South Holland Hall,
the Student Health Education
ofﬁce is an extension of SHS.

“We are very concerned with
the education aspect-of health
service. We would like to see
thinking change from, ‘You go to
the doctor when you're sick and
don’t worry about health until
then.’ One has to think of the

long-term effects of one’s actions,
suchas smoking or drinking, that
can not be seen immediately,”
explained Carter.

The Health Education office
offers workshops in addition to
diseminating literature and audio
or video tapes. Workshops are
conducted for weight control,
stress management, and CPR. A
one credit course- Drugs, Alcohol,
and Society, and a three credit
course — Human Sexuality, are
offered to students through Health
Education. Support groups and
self-help organizations, also work
out of Health education. “We are
setting up our ofiices for a social

worker, which should get under
way soon,” reflected Dr. Shirley
Haberman, Advisor at the Health
Education office.

“Our biggest problem at the
Brackenridge office is lack of
space. At the Forbes Clinic we
have much more space. The ideal
situation would be to have all
three offices consolidated. I
requested, years ago, 20,000
square feet at a multi—purpose
building to be built at the corner
of Forbes and Bouquet, but with
a change of president soon and
other concerns, it may be a while

Beating the rep...

Pitt's national reputation overcomes local scorn

By Jennifer Calabrese
News Editor

If you can ’t go to college, go to

locally, Pitt suffers from an image
contradiction.

“I think we are far, far better
than our reputation suggests. It
doesn't mean we are not without
problems, and it doesn’t‘mean
that we can't signiﬁcantly improve
the programs for undergraduate
students, but we don’t deserve
the reputation we have,” said Pitt
Provost Donald Henderson.

“Abroad our reputation is far.

better outside of Pittsburgh than
is the case in our own
environment. The prophet is
always better known outside of
his neighborhood than he is in
his own neighborhood.," he said.

Student Government Board
President Julie Shepard agreed
that Pitt's reputation is lacking
locally.

“People aren’t real excited
about Pitt within the city. I don’t
think that our state residents really
recognize everything we have to
offer, all the strengths, in
philosophy or what have you.
No one sees that side of it. They
still see the football team and the
basketball team and they don’t
necessarily see the academic side
of it,” she said.

Shepard added that while
interviewing candidates for the
position of vice president for
Student Affairs, she got a different
view of Pitt.

“Over and over again we heard
about the excellent reputation
that Pitt has nationally. I guess it
is the further away you go the
better it gets. If you are in
Oakland, forget it,” she said.

While campus leaders can only
theorize as to the cause of Pitt's
local reputation, Assistant Vice
President for University Relations
Mary Ann Aug has studied the
impressions that regional
residents have of Pitt.

“What we have found when
we’ve done studies around this
region is that people have a very

strong impression of Pitt when it
comes to research and the medical
part. People are more vague about
the undergraduate program here,”
she said.

“They put Pitt about in the

middle. They don’t put it up there

with Harvard and Princeton or
anything."

Tim Ziaukus, director of
communications, added that,
“Because we are the big guy in
town, you’re never a hero at home.
This I think is the glory and the
burden of all of the largest

By David W. Matta
Sta_0“ Writer

A tall, skinny man dressed in a dark suit
with a colorful, striped bow tie walked
into the room and sat down quietly. When
he said “Hello,” I knew that this would be
unlike any other interview. He was more
interested in talking to me than being
interviewed. Much of 61-year-old
Fred McFeely Rogers’ life has centered
around the city of Pittsburgh. The show
“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” has
enjoyed its most successful years in this
city on WQED-TV. The show’s name is
not just a title; Pittsburgh really is Mr.
Rogers’ neighborhood.

Rogers said that often when he is walking
around, people will stop to talk to him.

“It really is interesting. I find it, practically
all the time, a real blessing because people
will tell me very intimate things in their
[lives] because they have learned to trust
who this is on television. And so,
consequently, you don’t have to go
through minutes of talk about the weather
before people will share with you things
that might not have ever come to your
own knowledge, just because they sense
from the “Neighborhood” that you are a
trustworthy person. It is my hope and my
job to letthem know that I really am the
same person that they see on the
television.”

Fred Rogers was born in 1928 in Latrobe,
Pa., a small town about an hour east of
Pittsburgh. He was an only child until the
age of 11 when his parents adopted a
baby sister. He had a comfortable but
lonely childhood. He was overweight and

suffered from many allergies. He often
played with puppets when he found
himself bedridden with illness.

He went to Rollins College in
Winterpark, Fla., where he majored in
music composition. A

After graduating in 1951, he went to
New York and worked for NBC as an
assistant producer on “The Voice of
Firestone.” He later worked as ﬂoor
director for “The Lucky Strike Hit Parade,”
“The Kate Smith Hour” and “NBC Opera
Theatre.” ,

In 1952 he marriedjoanne Byrd, a pianist
who also graduated from Rollinsf

Mr. Rogers returned to Pittsburgh in
November, 1953, to work for WQED, the
country’s first community-supported
public-television station. The station was
not yet on the air, and Rogers’ job was to
plan program schedules for the following
yean

One of the shows he planned and
produced was “The Children’s Corner,”
which had a budget of $150 a week. The
format was a live, hour-long show hosted
by Pittsburgher Josie Carey. The show,
which _featured puppets controlled by
Rogers, was almost always performed
spontaneously. In 1955, the series won
the Sylvania Award for the best locally
produced children's program in the nation.

“Several regular puppets from today’s
“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” including
Daniel Striped Tiger and King Friday XIII,
were introduced on “The Children’s
Corner.”

During the seven years that Rogers
worked on this show, he spent his spare
time studying child development and
attending the Pittsburgh Theological
Seminary. He was ordained as a
Presbyterian minister in 1962 with a charge
to continue his work with children and
families through the media.

Rogers considered entering the
seminary after college, but he decided to
go into television to try to improve it. He
had seen too many bad television shows
where the themes involved saying mean

things to people or hurting people.

Rogers wanted to create a farnily-oriented
show which stressed the value of the child
as an individual.

“Mr. Rogers listens to what is behind
questions and responds with what he
knows about the person who is asking
them. He is someone who is interested in

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, September 5. 1990

gives in an atmosphere of care, and
consequently will learn far, far better than
a child who is made to feel inferior by what
a teacher might do or say,” he said.

“That is an interesting way of showing
pedagogy [the art of teaching], because
there are so many people who feel that you
have to superimpose a lot of ‘learning’ on

Pitt News File Photos

interpersonal relationships more than
cognitive striving. Now, that doesn’t mean
that I am not interested in people learning
facts, butl think that people learn because
of who they are, and everyone learns in a
unique way,” he said.

“And so, if you, in your own work, can
help somebody to feel valued, then that

person will have a much more fruitful

atmosphere in which to grow and in which
to learn.

“A child, for instance, who is able to get
the message that he or she has real value
will be able to accept what the teacher

people, and that [these people] just lap it
up like animals. Well, that's not so. People

learn because of who they’re in a
relationship with, and that starts right at the
very beginning. We learn to do things early
on because we want to please our primary
caretakers. ”

In 1963, Rogers moved to Toronto,
Canada, where he created a 15-minute
children's series called “Misterogers" on
CBC. For the first time, Rogers appeared on
camera as the host of the program. The
format of the program was very similar to
the current show.

, .

Mister Rogers ml/es about his real life neighborhood 

In 1964, he returned to Pittsburgh and
made the 15-minute show into a half-hour
format. The show was named “Mister
Rogers’ Neighborhood,” as it is called today.
The programs were distributed by the
Eastern Educational Network in 1966 and
1967.

In 1968, the series was made available to
the affiliates of the Public Broadcasting
Service. In that same year Rogers was
appointed chairperson of the forum on
mass media and child development of the
W/hite House Conference on Children and
Youth. Since then, Rogers’ contributions
have received many distinctions and

awards, including a George Foster Peabody‘,

Award for the show and two Emmys for
Rogers as a performer and a writer.
Rogers was happy to return to Pittsburgh
because he wanted to raise his two sons
here. He wanted them to experience many
of the same things that he had grown up

I with, as well as many of the new things that

Pittsburgh had to offer.
Rogers is currently the president of Family

Communications Inc., the nonprofit in

corporation that he founded in 1971 to
produce a wide variety of materials to
assist children and their families in
experiencing healthy emotional growth
and development. '

“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” is
watched by more than 7 million families
each week on almost 300 PBS affiliate
stations across the nation. There are nearly

600 episodes in the series. Rogers still 

writes and produces several weeks of new
programs each season to be sure that the
show’s topics are current in order to
effectively respond to the needs of children.

The program is the longest-running show
on public television and is watched mostly
by children between the ages of 2 and 6.
The show consistently ranks among PBS’s
top 10 programs.

Rogers leads a very farnily-oriented

lifestyle. Rogers, his wife Joanne, their two 

grown sons, daughter-in-law and grandson
live in Pittsburgh, and they often eat dinner
— which consists of vegetarian meals —
together at Rogers’ home.

Rogers tells many stories about being
treated like a celebrity in Pittsburgh. Despite
the fact that Rogers feels at home in
Pittsburgh —-— . he considers himself just
another citizen of this city —- he often
forgets how some people respond to seeing
him in public.

Once after his car had been stolen, the
police were able to identify the owner of
the abandoned car by some of its contents.
When Mrs. Rogers and her son went to
pick up the car, there was a group of
children and parents, expecting Rogers
himself to pick it up. Missing from Rogers’
car were his director’s chair and some
cassette tapes.

At another time, he went into a local toy
store and realized that the other people in
the .store had become very excited by his
presence. This made him feel somewhat
uncomfortable.

Rogers likes to go out, but he does admit
to being very much a “homebody.”

“I do feel more comfortable if I go to the
same places, where I am just ‘old hat.’ It’s
just when I walk into a new place that there
is a noticeable reaction,” he said.

Once after asking a police officer a
question and finding himself in the middle
of a long conversation about the
“Neighborhood,” he told his wife, “You
know, I always seem to forget what face I
am wearing.” \

To celebrate the 35th anniversary of
“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” PBS

showed a one—hour documentary special ‘

called “Our Neighbor, Fred Rogers.” The
program was a biographical look at Rogers

3tUd€I1t BO3fCl Of Trustee member says his power is limited

{ By Jennifer Calabrese

News Editor

He is the only student member
of Pitt's Board of Trustees. But
Paul Chappano, doesn’t know if
he can really represent Pitt
students’ best interests.

“As a student member of the
board you don't necessarily
represent all students as a whole;
you do because you are ‘picked
from among all pf the student
body [...] but you more or less
have to have the best interests of
the university in mind, not the
best interests of the students

3; because in times when tuition

needs to be raised the university's
interests have to come before the
students’,” he said.

Chappano is a first year Pitt
medical student who earned a
chemistry degree from Pitt in 1989.
He began his term as the student
trustee in March, after undergoing
a year-long selection process.

“I decided to apply and give it a
chance since I’d been pretty active
as an undergraduate,” Chappano

from his childhood to his place as
an American institution —— a title
which Rogers himself denies.

Rogers’ real-life mannerisms are
much like those he exhibits on
his show, downplaying
compliments and turning
conversation away from himself.

“I do think that it is much more
interesting to talk about feelings
rather than questions and
answers,” Rogers said. “It's so

much more important to find out “

who you're talking with than to
answer questions that could be
coming from a machine, in any
kind of conservation."

Much as he now does on “Mister
Rogers’ Neighborhood,” he used
to go to work on “The Children’s
Corner” in a suit and dress shoes.
However, he found it difficult to
run around behind stage
controlling the puppets in his
street clothes. Thus, he began to
bring a cardigan and a pair of
tennis shoes to work so he could
change before and after the show.

Over the years, Rogers’
cardigan sweaters have become
a part of our culture. A red
cardigan, one of 16 in his
wardrobe, is now on exhibit at
the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C. He began
wearing his trademark cardigans
because his mother knitted a new
one for him every year.

Although the actual format,

neighborhood segment, began in
Toronto, the program became
famous and recognized as the
premium public—television show
for children at WQED in
Pittsburgh.

Rogers said he truly appreciated
the opportunities that he received
in Toronto, but he was thrilled to
make his career at home here in
Pittsburgh.

said. “Even when I was in high
school I was always the kind of
guy that thought ‘why let someone
else do it if I can?’ I just always like
to get involved.” While an
undergraduate, he was in Delta
Tau Delta fraternity, served as
vice—president of
Interfraternity Council and was
on the University Senate Athletic
Committee.

Part of Chappano’s selection
included interviews with Pitt
president Wesley Posvar and
then-Interim Vice President for
Student Affairs Dennis Donham.

“As a graduate student he
knows how the university works
and its glitches,” Donharn said.
“He was a serious student yet he
had a social life. There are students
who get good grades and those
who are grinds — he’s not like
that. He works hard but he cares
about the students.”

Chappano’s responsibilities as
a trustee entail attending the

the ’

quarterly meetings of the board

as well as any meetings of the

three subcommittees he is on. His
first meeting in June collectively
took about ten hours. Among the
perks of being the student trustee:
dinner at the Povars’ home after
the meetings.

“I don’t think that many
students even realize what the
board really does. The board has
the authority, the overwhelming
authority, to do just about
anything and I got to meet
personally with, the trustees lat
Posvar’s]. That was very
interesting,” Chappano said.

Chappano’s seat on the board
also gives him the opportunity to
have the board investigate and
address any student concern that
he brings to them. ‘

“For instance if I think la student
organization] is doing a horrible
job then I can call whoever I want
and say I want somebody to look
into this and it will get done,”

Chappano said. But he hasn’t yet
seen any major problems to bring
to the board.

“From a student's point of view,
the university is nm pretty well,
besides maybe some concerns
about scheduling, but there are
always going to be lines,” he said.

One thing that Chappano thinks

more students should individually
be concerned with is the lack of
school spirit at Pitt.
“I mean it just bothers me. It’s
crazy. I know it’s a commuter
campus and that is all you can ask
for; I know people come people
go, [but] it seems like nobody
cares. We can’t even fill a stadium,”
he said.

Chappano’s term as a trustee
will probably last about three
years, his immediate plans as a
trustee are centered around what
he believes is the most important
thing the board will do this year
—— pick a person to replace Posvar,
who will be leaving in May.

“I have already personally
contacted the [chairperson] of the
presidential search committee to
tell him that I want to serve on that
committee," Chappanno said.
“Other than that the potential for
what I can accomplish in three
years probably isn’t that great
other than having a say on a few
things.”

A native of Mingo Junction,
Ohio, Chappano came to Pitt
because he was offered a
scholarship. He said his Catholic
upbringing has a strong influence
on his outlook.

“lAttendingl Catholic schools all
my life [has affected] my thoughts
on a lot of things. I guess I’m
pretty conservative on most
issues,” he said.

Chappano, who is considering

Aerospace medicine as a career is 7

currently trying to obtain a Navy

‘Health professions scholarship,

which would cover the rest of his
tuition for medical school.

Professor encourages all students to study abroad

By Marietta Pacella
For Tbe Pitt News

All people who study abroad
will tell you it has changed their
lives, according to Keith
McDuffie, professor and
chairperson of the Hispanic
languages and literature
department.

Studying abroad changed
McDuffie’s life 30 years ago. He
received his bachelor’s degree in
English at Gonzaga University in
1954 and attended graduate
school at Middlebury College in
Vermont.

It was at Middlebury that he
was given the opportunity to
study abroad. In 1959, McDuffie,
along with a group of 20 other
Middlebury students, took
advantage of the opportunity to
study at the University of Madrid.

“I originally decided to study
abroad because I simply wanted
to live in another country. I had
studied Spanish since I was a
sophomore in high school, and I
had always had an interest in it.
But it wasn’t until after I had
moved to Spain that I decided to
change my field of study to
Hispanic languages and
literatures and get my [master’s
degreel,” said McDuffie.

He explained that when he
studied in Spain 30 years ago, the
country had notvyet recovered
from its civil war (1936-1939).
Twenty years after the war, Spain
was still an extremely poor

country. It wasn't until the 1960s
that Spain became popular with
tourists.

“[Franciscol Franco won the civil
war in the 1930s, and under
[Franco's dictatorship], Spain
wasn't really accepted by the other
European nations. They were all
democracies. When I was there in
1959, President Eisenhower had
just begun to help Spain grow
economically, but it wasn’t until
Franco died in 1975 that Spain
really started trying to reintegrate
itself back into the European
economy,” recalled McDuffie.

Since 1959, tourism has become
a major source of income for
Spain. The Spain of today is very
different from the place where
Keith McDufﬁe once studied.

According to McDuffie, “Spain
is now a very modern and vibrant
country. Thirty years ago, good
things were lost and gained. A
positive is that the standard of
living for Spaniards has been
raised. But life was a simpler thing
when I studied there. A little
slower, more relaxed. You could
sit at the cafe tables for hours and
talk. Now it’s much more speeded
up. Madrid is a little more like
New York now."

When he studied in Madrid 30
years ago, the city had a pop-
ulation of 2 million. Today, the
city holds 6 million, and the
University of Madrid educates
100,000 students each year.

McDuffie received his master's
degree from Middlebury College/

ZII--- STUDENT
GVERN MEN T

Elections Committee

University of Madrid in 1960 and
later received his doctorate in
Hispanic languages and literature
at Pitt in 1969. He- has been
professor and chairperson of the
Hispanic languages and literature
department at the University of
Pittsburgh since 1975.

His experience not only
changed his own life’s course,
but it affected his daughter’s as
well. During her freshman year of
college, she studied at the
University of Madrid and later
went on to study at Montpellier in
southern France. She then
returned to the United States to
graduate from Oberlin University
in 1989.

“I think you will find it is often
true that [when] one of the parents
in a family has studied abroad,
some of the children study abroad,
too. The idea gets put in their
heads by their parents," he said.

McDufﬁe believes that it is going

to prove necessary for American V

students to have a better
understanding of other cultures,

and the best way to develop such
an understanding is to experience
them firsthand.

“We [Americans] tend to be kind
of isolated, and we can’t be. We’ve
seen it in the headlines for the last
month. We can’t afford to be
isolated.”

“Most foreign businessmen’

know at least one or more foreign
languages, so I think competition
is going to be a really tough thing
for Americans. The way I look at

it, the students of today are going
to be the people who have to
make all of the decisions
tomorrow. American under-
graduates don’t think much about
studying abroad, but in fact [they]
probably should. I don’t think it’s
within the American student’s
concept of what college is all
about. They don’t feel it’s essential
to college life.”

And as McDuffie pointed out,
“one of the biggest values of

studying abroad isn’t just to learn
more about the rest of the world,
but to understand your own
country better. There’s nothing
like getting into another culture
to better understand your own,
because beforehand, you have
nothing to compare it to. I think it‘
makes a person a better citizen‘
and voter as a result.”

McDuffie also emphasizes that
a student does not have to be a

of the accident victims, who are
believed to be those who were in
the Suburu.

Sam Lamison, nursing
supervisor at Mercy Hospital,
confirmed the ‘arrival of ﬁve
accident victims. Injured were
Goodwin, 57; his wife, Roxanne;
their two children, Raymond, 4,
and Ryan, 3, and Hawkins, 32.
Lamison said that all were in fair
condition and due to be
discharged last night except
Goodwin, who was in serious
condition. No cardiac
examination was performed on
Goodwin, however, because he
did not complain of chest pain.

Glenn Hardy, reporting officer
at the scene, could not confirm
any details pending further
investigation.

As the first week of school ends, many students who
moved into off-campus housing are finding that the reality
of their housing situation is much different than what they
were originally expecting. A -

Unfortunately, there is virtually no way for students to
avoid this disappointment because they have no guide to
off—campus housing. I

The university could provide a great service to students
if it took the responsibility of creating a rating system for

~off-campus housing. They could do this by inspecting the

apartments before prospective tenants actually moved
into them. The results of these inspections could then be
made availablein the Commuter Resource Center.

While the university would have to spend money to do
this, the cost would greatly benefit the students. Since Pitt
does not provide adequate on—campus housing for its
students, it should at least make an effort to ensure that
students can avoid substandard apartments.

Universities are always trying to show prospective
students that they are the university’s No. 1 priority. The
University of Pittsburgh could take a big step toward
making that attempt believable with a guide like this one.

Buslawbacleed...  

If Nostradamus said it, George'll do it

Are you nervous? Just a little,
maybe? I know I am. And not just
a little, either. I’m a lot nervous.
But I wasn’t always this way. Just
a little while ago, I was fine. Fine
and dandy, in fact. But a little
while ago, U.S. warships and
planes weren't heading for the
Persian Gulf. A while ago, I could
sit through a whole half-hour of
“Jeopardy” and notbe interrupted
by T om Brokaw.

See, all this multi-media
bombardment about Iraq has

really put me in a strange mood. I '

don’t know about you, but on
Aug. 2 I was enjoying myself in a
local drinking establishment
when.I first heard about Iraq’s
invasion of Kuwait.

A friend of mine came up to me
and told me that we both might
be seeing a lot of desert real soon
and that I should invest in some
sunscreen. He then proceeded to
tell me about the invasion.

Since that night my life has
become a string of newspaper
articles, radio talk shows and “we
interiuptyour regularly scheduled
television program for this special
news update.” It has become
impossible to go anywhere or do
almost anything without
somehow being exposed to all
this radioactive media fallout. And
it's not helping my chain-smoking
habit at all. A '

OK, I know we're not talking
about global thermonuclear war
here. But some of the biggest kids
on the block are about to tango
on top of 40 percent of the world's
oil supply. And it's all making me
a little nervous.

The world as we know it could
radically change in the next 24

. hours. Or the next six. Or the next
one. Every time I see President
George Bush talking to the nation

on television, I get this feeling
akin to driving a truck loaded
with easily irritable explosives
down a steep hill and realizing
that the warranty on the brakes
has just expired. I’m holding my
breath waiting for the other shoe
to drop.

And it’s not just me, either. Just
the other night I was on the bus
going back to my apartment, and
I could see that everyone on the
bus was feeling much the same
way. Everyone was subdued but
uneasy at the same time. Even the
obligatory schizophrenic in the

Louis
  Stein

back corner was being quiet (too
quiet, if you ask me).

They all knew that they could
get off the bus, go into their homes,
turn on the television and OOOPS!
Someone just dropped a small
tactical nuke down an oil well

(funny thing about oil wells —

most of them
underground).

No more super-unleaded-9}
octane-removes~knocks-and-
pings-from-your—engine gasoline
for you, buddy! No more motor
oil. And no more heating oil for
that matter, either. You will have
to take out a bank loan just to buy
a gallon of gas (but first you will
have to wait in line at the station
longer than you would for Rolling
Stones tickets). And suddenly
everyone will start to remember
the last time they rented The Road
Warrior on videotape.

So, when I returned home that
night, I made sure that I didn’t

COFIIICCI

turn on the television or radio or
anything else that might be the
bearer of bad news. But still, it
was bothering me. I mean, I don’t
really believe all that stuff, but
didn’t Nostradamus say that
something like this was going to
be the start of the Apocalypse? 1
think I saw it on HBO.

But I digress. That night I did
the only thing I could think to do.
I went over to the phone (the
special red phone under the
stylish clear—plastic cake cover)
and called up the home office.
The question I had was a simple
one: “What do you do on the last
day before the end of the world?”
This was their reply:

Top 10 Things To Do Before
The Apocalypse:

#10 Go to a tiuck-and—tractor-
pull show and don’t wear a ﬂannel
shirt. I

# 9 Get a facial tattoo. '

# 8 Smoke a big doobie with
Nancy Reagan.

# 7 Load a high-powered riﬂe
and systematically hunt down the
New Kids On The Block.

# 6 Calljimmy Swaggart on the
phone and tell him you're Satan.

# 5 Call Satan on the phone and
tell him you're Jimmy Swaggart

# 4 Find Randel Charles Marten
(of the Hair Replacement
Program) and scream “Nice wig,
pal!"

# 3 Tell your boss/ professor to
go to hell.

# 2 Drink heavily.

And the #1 thing to do before the
Apocalypse (drum roll please,
Anton):

# 1 Pray, damn you! Pray!

Aug. 30 —-— Two males gave $80
to another male who approached
them in the Towers lobby and
offered to sell them a VCR and
compact discs. The third male put
the money in a white bank
envelope and threw an “envelope
which looked like the original
one” down the sewer. The man

then disappeared with the.

envelope containing the money.
Many incidents similar to this have
been reported.

Sept. 3 — A ‘man called the
police to complain about his
daughter's roommate, who was
playing music too loudly in the
room. The roommate stated that
she was playing the music loudly
to get back at the first girl, whose
boyfriend spent the night without
her roommate’s approval. Papers
have been filed to separate the
roommates.

Sept. 3 — A female reported
that while walking up the stairs of
the Original Hot Dog Shop, she
was grabbed by a city police
officer, pulled down four steps
and knocked into a mirror. The
girl was not a Pitt student and
would have to notify the
Pittsburgh Police, the Original Hot

Luxbacherjuggles time with composing, coaching

By Doug Miller
&@ﬂWWHwr

Educator. Coach. Programming coordinator.
Former pro-soccer player. Author.

Five different job titles describe Pitt’s versatile
soccer coach, Joe Luxbacher. As the Panther soccer
team prepares to kick off the 1990 season this
afternoon at St. Francis College, Luxbacher will put
a hectic summer behind him and sprint into a

' difficult fall season. He is a busy man, but he prefers

it that way.

Actually, Luxbacher has been busy since he
graduated from Pitt with a bachelor’s degree in
biological science in 1974. From there he played a
combined five years of professional soccer with the
Philadelphia Atoms in the North American Soccer

V League, with the Pittsburgh Miners of the American

Soccer League and finally opening the door of the
Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League
by scoring the Spirit’s first goal in its inaugural year.

Luxbacher has won the prestigious Dapper Dan
Banquet Soccer Award for touring with a select
team that traveled Europe in 1977. The following
year he earned his master’s in health, physical
education and recreation, eventually becoming the
head coach at Mt. Union College in Ohio, where he

coached until 1981.

He returned to his alma mater, succeeding Leo

Bemis, Pitt’s all-time winningest soccer Coach. Between writing numerous books about soccer, Panther head coach
Luxbacher returned to Oakland with impressive Joe Luzbacher will find time to guide Pitt through its toughest season.

credentials, including a 24-12-11 at Mt. Union as well
as an “A” accreditation from the United States Soccer
Federation. While at Pitt, he has compiled a 52-39-
10 record, using mostly area players and very few
foreign players, while many of Pitt’s opponents
have imported handfuls of European booters.

Which brings us to another of Luxbacher’s hobbies
— writing. He has authored five books, starting
with Soccer.- A Guide for Players, Coaches and
Fans. 7hat book was often referred to as the start of
the western Pennsylvania soccer boom in the early
1980s. He followed with The Soccer Goalkeeper: A
Guide for Players and Coaches, as well as Soccer.-
Winning Techniques and Fun Games for Soccer
Training.

The Panther Skipper has recently had another
one of his books hit the bookstand-.Soccer: Steps to
Success, published by the Human Kinetics
Publishers. Luxbacher is a freelance writer who
admits that putting his books together is difficult. “I
don’t so much enjoy the writing and all the things
which go into the processing of a book; however,
I have been very pleased with the final results.” He
also said that another book, which is untitled as yet,
is due out later this fall.

It is probably better for all concerned parties that
the upcoming book is now in the hands of the

merely repeating as Big East
champions is not god enough.
He has his sights set on bigger
and better things —- namely,
success at ‘ the NCAA
championships in Austin, Texas.

“We are going to strive to be
the best we can be at the highest

_ possible level,” said Knoles. “The

big goal is Austin, and we will
sacriﬁce whatever we can to get
there.” Knoles hopes to take six
swimmers to Austin. V
The Panthers have won eight
consecutive Big East titles, and
that degree of success can breed
complacency, but Knoles
promises not to let that happen.
“You keep perennial Big East

champions hungry for victory by
waking them up to the fact that
the Bi “East is notnthe toughest
corr'r11rp‘ét'it'i'(‘)'r‘1 atauaa, ” said Knoles.
“Compared to the [competition at
the NCAA championship meet],
the Big East is a high-school dual
meet. It is that much of a
difference.” ,
Knoles will be looking to former
Pitt swimming star Mike Kozlina
as well as assistant coach Mark
Davin to help lead the talent-rich
squad. “I expect a lot of leadership
from Mike,” said Knoles. “He
knows what it takes to compete
on the the NCAA Division I level,
and I am counting on him to relate

‘that winning attitude to the team.”

Davin, ajformer head coach at
one of the dominant U.S.
swimming teams in Arizona, has
helped produce 12 Olympic
qualifiers and has coached at the
National Swimming Hall of Fame

in. Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.

The only teams talented enough
to challenge Pitt’s title are
Syracuse and Villanova, and they
finished nearly 200 points behind
the Panthers in last year's Big East
Championships.

“The Big East is not known as a

, swimming conference, but we are
very quickly becoming that,” said
Knoles. “There is a lot of parity in
the Big East, and it will be harder
to dominate the conference as
the other teams’ [talent] catches
up with Pitt. Syracuse has issued
a challenge to the title, and
Villanova is a big question mark.”

The swimming season is one of
the longest and most grueling in
collegiate athletics, beginning in
October and not ﬁnishing until
rnid-March. When spring nears
and the waters become still, the
challenges of Coach Knoles may
be answered.

come to terms with their football mortality,
something the 49ers don't seem to have.
Feel free to tell me I’m full of it, but there is
something  uh  supernatural about the
way this team plays football.

What did the 49ers and certain
constituents achieve in 1989 that has flung
them to the heights of legend? A sampling:

Lantagne and Adarnson are no
