University Rejects
State School Status

By BARRY GROSS

The University has decided not to become a state uni-

versity because the change would affect its other sources of
funds and loosen its control of the curriculum.

Bernard Adams, special assistant to the Chancellor, said
that the University decided not to become state supported
“in essence because they did not want to take funds which

 Tuition Raise
a By Matt Swetonic

Bernard Adams, special assist-
ant to the Chancellor, has ad-
vanced three reasons for the re-
cent tuition increase in a special
tape recorded interview to be
ibroadcast tonight at 9 p.m. on
station WPGH.

According to Adams, the state
legislature supplies the University
with approximately 15 percent of
its operating expenses for any one
year. However, this year there
was a “state cut-back of approxi-
mately.11/2 million dollars” which
has necessitated the resulting tui-
tion increase.

This has combined with an un-
"xexpectedl drop in freshman en-
, rollment and a recommendation
‘ by the University's accrediting

group for higher teacher salaries
to produce this “long debated de-
cision.

Income Scarce

“We have no other immediate
source of income and therefore
had no alternative than to go to
the students for the increase,”
Adams stated.

“Although endowments from
private concerns have tripled
in the past few years, We are
not receiving sufficient gifts
from the alumni to cover our
expenses.”

Temple University has decided
to become a state university with
the approval of the next two state
legislatures. Because of this
change, the other state universi-
ties will receive less funds, as will
this University and the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania.

Penn Rejected

The University of Pennsylvania
rejected a proposal to become a
state institution immediately. The
proposal was studied here for
several months.

If the University had accepted
the proposal they would lose
some control of the curriculum,
lose the support of foundations
which only support private in-
stitutions, and lose other en-
dowment sources, according to
University officials. P '

When Temple University be-
comes a state institution, it will
receive a 74 per cent increase in
state aid and could reduce annual
tuition from $880 to $780, adding
900 students to its undergraduate
enrollment of 7000.

‘New Left’ Objects

At least one student group on
campus urges State and Federal
governments to assume more of
the costs for college education. A
mimeographed sheet distributed
by a student group asks for stu-
dents to write to state and na-
tional congressmen and Chancel-

Under the plan, Schneider will
travel to Europe by chartered
ﬂight in mid June and return to
the United States in the second
week of September.

To Tour Europe

For the first eight. weeks he will
work as a chemical engineering
trainee, living with a family in
Germany. Then, for the rest of the
time, he will tour Europe.

Schneider was selected on the
basis of his QPA, industrial ex-
perience, University and civic
activities, and his desire to util-
ize the experiences which he
will gain in his travels with his
associates.

Computer Used
To Test Skills
Of Administrators

Students and staff of the
Graduate School of Public
and International Aﬁairs will

.test their skills as adminis-

trators in a “Community
Model Game.” Using an IBM
7070 computer, they will carry a
hypothetical city through a 30-
year development program.

Dr. Nathan D. Grundstein, pro-
fessor of administration in the
school, presented the plan to the
128th annual session of the Amer-
ican Association for the Advance-
ment of Science meeting in Den-
ver on December 29.

The characteristics of the com-
munity are stated in a paper pre-
pared by Grundstein in coopera-
tion with Professor William B.
Kehl, director of the Computer
and Data Processing Center.

“The community selected as
the subject for play is a par-
tially developed, geographically
bounded, autonomous suburban
political unit with deﬁnite func-

sources, demand levels for serv-
ices, costs, output of services.

the players (the factor of utility
of value) which will be express-
ed through a sequence of decis-
ions over time reflecting prefer-
red outcomesconcerning the pre-
sent and future course of devel-
opment of the city.”

The computer, showing the ad-
ministrators the social character
of the area as a whole as well as
its internal nature, will in turn
receive the decisions of the play-
ers. At the end of the 30-year
program, from one to two years

 Views Expressed
On Tuition Hike

Students Question Validity
Of Reason For Rate Increase

By RAISHA SILBERTVIAN
Although the Univcrsitg/‘s latest tuition increase is indicative of

. which presently is too high.’

opinions about how the tuition

a general trend throughout the c

ountry, students are still asking

why and claiming that they cannot see the results of the extra
money they pay. The unescpectedness of this increase was another

cause of dissatisfamion.

The following is a sampling
many of the students.

Anne McParland, Arts ’63:

of the opinions being voiced by

“It is my understanding that

the Chancellor’s Committee advised him not to raise the tui-
tion because of the current low freshman enrollment. As-

suming this, I would like to kno
Marc Samuels, Arts ’65: “

W why the increase occurred.”
Although raises must be ex-

pected periodically, this one seemed to be sprung on the

students. The freshmen especially?
feel this, since they heard nothing
at all about it during Orientation.
It seems to me that if the Uni-
versity is still in debt, there must
be something wrong with the
handling of the budget.”

Some students had deﬁnite

they pay should be used.
Athletics Overemphasized
Ed, Lees, Arts ‘63 “the tuition
increase is one of necessity, but
out-oi’.-state students are unjustly
penalized. A school which sup-
posedly has high values of educa-
tion should not place so much em-
phasis on athletics and other ac-
tivities which are not in keeping
with the above values. I hope the
tuition raise can be used to im-
prove the student faculty ratio

Roberta Friedman, Arts ‘64:
“Instead of making superﬁcial
improvements, such as the Stu-
dent Union, salaries of profes-
sors should be increased so
that the University can draw
more professors, instead of
graduate students.”

Jacques Wertheimer, Arts ‘63:
“Even along with all the tuition
raises, due to budget cuts in this
area, Student Affairs is still pro-
viding minimum services to the
students.”

Inability to see justification for
the latest raise was expressed by
some students.

Inﬂation Blamed

Robert Schwimmer, Arts ‘62: “I
must sympathize with the Uni-
versity in that they are the vic-
tims of an inﬂationary economic
system at present. However, I do
not think that inflation has, over
the last three years, produced a
need for a two-fold increase, as
has been the case.”

Richard Felt, Arts ‘65: “Since

I enrolled I have encountered
two tuition hikes, but I have
seen no rise in the University
quality. It seems to me that by
another hike, the University is
getting more money to throw
away on such major mainten-
ance problems as new tissue

holders in the men’s dorms.”
Although therevhas been “a lot
of talk about transferring”, Pam

Dreyer, Arts ‘65, thinks “much of

this is just talk. However, stu-
dents are talking about wanting
to qualify for scholarships.” On
the other hand, Rosemary Galioto:
Arts ‘65 had the following state-
ment to make:
Scholarships Sought
“I am an out-of—state student,
with a loan and a scholarship, and
I am still thinking seriously of
translerring. Even if I had more
money, I would not think this
University is worth the raise.”
According to Susan Schwartz,
Education ‘63. ”Much of the re-
sentment about this latest tui-
tion raise is because we upper-
classmen feel that we are pay-
ing for beneﬁts that-we will not
be here to enjoy.” ‘
Even thought Dennis lVIcCart.hy,
Eng. ‘62, feels that “College stu-
dents should be broadminded
enough to understand the situa-
tion,” the general feeling of the
students interviewed is one of re-
sentment and unjustified penali-
zation. ‘

T uition—— Qua Vmlis ?

There’s no doubt that the University needs money to
operate and even less doubt that students resent paying
those costs when immediate tangible beneﬁts are lacking.
Nevertheless, that’s the situation facing Pitt at the present
time. With the recent tuition raise students must pay for
the University’s increasing educational costs, and they
want to know why. The answer’s not an easy one, but in
the next few issues the Pitt News will attempt to examine
this issue as closely as possible.

As things now stand, the University has four major
areas from which to acquire funds——alumni, private grants,
state aid, and students. In the first three instances the Uni-
versity has little or no control over these monies. But tui-
tion can be regulated by the administration. As was point-
ed out, however, this money is used solely for teachers’
salaries, library maintenance, and laboratory expenses. Such
objectives are commendable in themselves, but the ques-
tion arises “are students actually getting their money’s
worth?” The proposed Hillman Library is still tucked safe-
ly in the future, and for every one of the Mellon Profes-
sors now employed by the University, many other gradu-
ate assistants and University professors can be named to
offset such quality. The range is now from very good to
Very bad. ‘

Even so, the Mellon Professors have set a standard
which should be met as closely as possible by all members
of the teaching faculty. But the Mellon Professors have a
distinct advantage. Their salaries are drawn from a private
grant which takes much of the burden from the Univer-
sity. Teachers, on the other hand, must depend to a large
extent on the University’s yearly income from tuition. If
there is no money, there can be little hope for quality
teachers.

The recent tuition raise, therefore, will better enable
the University to extend its quest for quality over a wider
range in order to eliminate the academic gulf presently
experienced between a Mellon professor and a graduate
assistant. . I

While this appears to be the obvious beneﬁt derived
from the tuition hike, however, the problem is far more
complex. Quality of students, quality of administrators, and
quality hf the total academic image are factors farmore
subtle than any ﬁnancial ﬁgures.

Refuge For the Frustrated...

Conservative Crisis

By Nofhcm Firestone

The events of the last two years in the area
of foreign affairs have acted as a brutal shock to
the American public. The Congo, Laos, Gagarin
and Titov, Berlin, and the fall-out shelter mania
have brutally awakened most
Americans to the perilous posi-
tion they are now in.

To add to this dismay, Presi-
dent Kennedy has. warned, and
rightly so, that the struggle with
communism will be long and
tedious, and that victory will not
come easily.

These are not the sort of
words that people like to hear, ,
and-they breed frustration — a
feeling of inadequacy at not be-
ing able to do something positive that will have
clear-cut results.

This attitude of frustration is now reﬁected in
what is supposed to be “a tide of conservatism
sweeping across the country.” Actually, there is
more. There are the “respectable” conservatives
such as Goldwater and Tovver, who are really 19th
Century liberals, as a conservative explained to me,
and there is the “lunatic fringe” or radical right.

There is an important differentiation here, and
the “respectable” conservatives do as much as they
can to dissociate themselves from such groups as
the American Nazi Party, the Minutemen, and
other conglomerations of the deranged. It is un-
fortunate that such members of our society have
developed neurotic tendencies because of our battle
with communism, and our sympathies should be
extended to them.

 

Sympathy —— Not Tolerafion

But sympathy is one thing, and toleration of
danger is another. There is no reason in the world
why groups of citizens should be allowed to train
their own battle squads to ﬁght those who they
think are communists. They are as subversive as
corresponding left-wing “front” organizations, and
should be dealt with accordingly.

But their total extremism gives them a ridicu-
lous connotation, and they lose their effectiveness.

But the real danger comes from the “respect-
able” conservatives, for they are not laughed at. If
one can accept the premise that a healthy nation
moves forward both in social legislation and in
world position, and when one sees how the con-
servatives hinder this forward step, then the dan-
ger of the disease of conservatism becomes
apparent.

Inherent in the word “conservatism” is the im-

Letters to the Editor

 

plication that those who follow this ideology are
generally opposed to what most people consider
progressive legislation, merely because it is a
change from the status quo.

The conservatives are our most vocal patriots,
Yet it is not unreasonable to expect that these same
people would have been Tories during the Revo-
lution-ary War, opposing Tom Paine's and Jeffer-
son's “radicalism.” I

They are the loudest advocates of the Constitu-
tion, yet they are opposed to granting constitutional
rights to all of our citizens, including the Negro in
the South. "

They are the advocates of a bold foreign policy,
and then they base their entire thinking on a
cowardly, unimaginative phrase such as “Better
Dead than Red.” Such an outlook is cowardly be-
cause it appeals to the emotions and not to the
mind -—— the traditional demagogic outlet, and
unimaginative because there is another choice that

they cannot see, the defeat of communism without -

thermo—nuclear war.

See ‘Creeping Socialism‘

They are for the individual, but their thinking
is strangely contradictory here. They really have
no contact with the mass of America — the mass
that relies on social security, the mass that relies
on a health plan for the aged, the mass that
depends on honest trade unions.

And, indeed, they are cowardly by failing to
meet demands for progressive legislation by intelli-
gent argument, but by referring to it as “creeping
socialism.”

They would invade Cuba with U. S. Marines,
but are afraid to consider the repurcussions -—' the.
eventual aliennation of all of Latin America from
the United States.

They cry that Tshombe and Katanga are perse-
cuted by the UN, and they never stop to think that
almost the entire non-western world realizes that
Tshombe is a puppet of European mining interests,
and could never be independent.

They would withdraw from the UN, and not

consider that the UN represents our only hope fo ‘

a peaceful victory against communism.

It is important to see that conservatives are not
against any and all progress because of malicious-
ness. This is not the case at all. They are conser-
vative because they are frustrated, and if this is
an inadequate excuse, it is still an excuse.

But it is the duty of the clear-thinking, sensible
citizen to avoid the emotional attraction of con-
servatism and to concentrate on the reasonable ap-
proach to domestic and foreign relations, although
it may be the more difficult one.

Thompson Explains

Health Service Fee

Editor, The Pitt News

Your issue of December 13
gives good and accurate coverage
to the Student Health Service's
new plans and to the Student
Health Service Fee. The editorial
in the same issue raises fair ques-
tions.

There are several comments
that I should like to make re-
garding these matters. It is the

aim of the University and of its
Student Health Service to make
signiﬁcant contributions to the
health education of the students,
and the fulfillment of this aim
will mean that all students should
beneﬁt by the activities of the
Student Health Service whether
or not they personally visit it.
Also, the Student Health Service
will be there. on guard so to
speak, ready to serve the stu-
dents in emergencies whether or
not those students regularly re-
ceive their care at the Student
Health Service or elsewhere.
Further. I anticipate that these
new plans will mean that the
University community will be-
come a healthier one in its
broadest aspects. From this, all
will beneﬁt.

The policies to be adopted in
regard to this are innovations only
at the University of Pittsburgh—
they are regularly in practice

now at many University Student
Health Services where they are
much appreciated by both resi-
dent and commuting students. Co-
lumbia is one such closely par-
allel situation that comes immedi-
ately to my mind. There are many
others. «

o

The fee that has been establish-
ed is a_ very modest one I— both
comparatively and actually. It has
been calculated carefully and I
hope will prove basically to be
adequate. It provides, however,
only for outpatient care, and thus
the Student Health Service itself
can never, by deﬁnition become a
hospital of any size merely
a first rate clinic. The in—patient
care that is_ necessary will be
provided for resident students int
hospitals with the insurance as
the basic. ﬁnancial mechanism for
this.

However, it is certainly the plan
for the service to be far more than
diagnostic -—— although even this,
to be done correctly, requires
more facilities than were avail-
able previously, access to labora-
tories, x-rays, etc. — all of which
is included in the plan at no ad-
ditional cost to the student ex-
cept in very unusual situations.
Superior care of an ambulatory
nature is a vital part of these
new plans.

Of course, all of this represents
a striking departure from the
past in terms of service as well

as ﬁnancing it (previously stu-
dents did not pay for the basic
services rendered by the Student
Health Service), and it will take
time and working experience to
enable the Student Health Service
really to begin to achieve its goals.
I trust that all concerned will up-
preciate this and will help with
constructive criticism which will
be welcome and essential if the
goals are to be achieved.

‘There is a Fencing

Team,’ Reader Replies

Editor, The Pitt News

In a recent letter appearing in
this column it was stated that
there is no fencing team. There
is a fencing team —- sponsored by
the Women’s Recreation Associa-
tion and open to both men and
women.

The team meets regularly for
instruction and practice on Thurs-
day noon in the Cathedral Gym.
During the past trimester the
team has had an inter—team meet
with La Salle D'Escrime, the
Pittsburgh Fencing Club, and has
sent members to tournaments in
Cleveland and Pittsburgh spon-
sored by the Amateur Fencing
League of America.

”“KQV Awards ‘Apples’ to Chemist

A bushel of apples has been
awarded to Dr. Henry S. Frank
of the Department of Chemistry.

The “Apple for Teacher
Award” is made by radio station
KQV every school day. Listeners
are invited to send the station a
letter nominating their favorite
teacher.

Three freshmen students wrote
the letter which won the apples
for Dr. Frank.

They explained that they had
expected their chemistry class of
300 students to be cold and
formal, but that Dr. Frank had
mixed humor with knowledge,

helping to break down the barrier ‘ .

between student and teacher.

The award was for last Thurs-
day and was announced on KQV
ten times during the day.

A & P and KQV sent Dr. Frank

176 apples which he cut in half
and distributed to his 280 Chem-
istry students last Friday.
“This is very gratifying,” Dr.
Frank commented. “I was not ex-

 pecting the award. It indicates

that the students ﬁnd the class
worthwhile.”

Bad Second Half Halts

It was two different Pitt basketball teams that played in
the Field House Saturday night. In the first half it was a
hustling squad that took a 30-26 lead to the dressing room;
but the second half showed a tired ﬁve boys who seemed to

"It Goes On..."

EMPTY STOMACHS GROWL

What the overextended armies of Napoleon and Hitler
learned too late: nobody wins on a halt-full stomach. Duke
University’s basketball team learned when they lost their
only game to the season to Duquesne last month in the Steel
Bowl tourney.

The Blue Devil’s lack of faith in the olfactory nerves
of backcourtman Bill Ulrich led to their distasteful setback.
On the afternoon of the contest the Duke team was dining
in the Carlton House, when Ulrich observed upon taking a
whiff of his orange juice: “Man, this stuff smells like its thirty
years old!”

Ulrich passed up his orange juce, but the othersgurgled
it delightfully. That evenino‘, prior to the center jump, every
Blue Devil was blue in the gills, and regurgitating in the
dressing room sans the little Cyrano de Bergerac whose nose
nearly saved the day.

Threatened Legal Action

One of the Duke’s coaching aides remarked at the time
that the team would press for legal investigation to see if
the team had been doped or not.

It reminds one of the time that Harold Johnson, the
light-heavyweight champ of boxing, was weakened by a
tampered orange prior to a big ﬁght. Everyone’s stealing
the idea from the wicked witch who put Snow White to sleep
once upon a time.

 

=l< >l< *
Another interesting sidelight on the Duke team
S which is now ranked seventh in the nation was the play
of their All-American candidate, Art Heyman.

“The Pest” was putting on an appaling display of his
talents in both ends of the two—day carnival, leaving the
local burghers with the misconception (at least we think so)
that he is a pseudo-All—A_merican.

In the consolation contest, however, against a hapless
Arizona team, even we were soured on the Long Islander’s
right to recognition; He was inserted in the lineup with his
team leading by 30 points, apparently to pad his scoring
totals.

Ball-Hog

This he did with a zesty fervor, but he still wasn’t sat-
isﬁed with his prodigious output of shots. He barked at Ul-
rich, a dwarf in the backcourt who was making an honest
effort, “Come on, pass me the ball, pass me the ball. I’m
the scorer on this team. Ask the coach.”

Roundball buffs claim that neither Don Hennon of Pitt
or Sihugo Green of Duquesne‘ would have permitted their
coaches to send them in on such a farce.

=61 3% >l=

Mossie Murphy, the Pied Piper of the Bluff, who pounds
a gavel-like ﬁst on tables when he’s orating, was at it again
at Gustine’s Restaurant last week, barking about his pet
topic: Duquesne. It was after the win over Pitt.

Dukes No. I

“We have re-established ourselves ﬁnally as the No. 1
team in this town,” he hollered. “Pitt will never catch up
to us now. We’re tops, and they’ll nevfr beat us now.”

=l¢ >1:

When Coach Bob Timmons remarked that'Jerry Lucas
was better than Terry Dischinger in the hostile land of In-
diana where Terry’s the biggest “Dish” since Marilyn Monroe,
Roy McHugh, formerly of the Pittsburgh Press, and now
sports editor of the Evansville Sunday Courier and Press
quipped, “Here is a man who would criticize Castro in Cuba.”

>i= >l= >l=
The lady from Penn State who wrote a nasty letter
about me, emphasizing the sportsmanship that is taught
at Penn State, ought to look in her own backyard.

I think it was deplorable of Wayne Lundy, the 6 ft. 6 in.,
star of Penn State’s basketball team to quit on his team when
he found out that he would be ineligible the next semester.
He could have played six more games, and one coach has
called him “a pretty poor athlete.”

Cats Take
Wilkes Title
Witlt Ease

A powerful display of over-

all team strength in winning
the Wilkes College
Wrestling Tournament has
marked the Panther wrestling
team as one of the top mat
squads in the nation.

In completely outdistancing
their nearest rivals, the Ithaca
Grapplers, 85-46, the Panthers
placed in seven of the tourna-
ment’s ten weight divisions, with
Rich Martin, John Zolikoﬁ, and
Tom Jeffries winning titles.

Before the tournament began,
the “Amateur Wrestling News,”
highly respected publication in
collegiate wrestling circles, rated
the Panthers number four in the
country,.behind Oklahoma State,
Lehigh, and Oklahoma University.

If the ratings were put out
weekly the Blue and Gold
would have probably moved
ahead of Oklahoma on the basis
of their strong Wilkes showing
and 0klahoma’s loss to Lehigh.

Coach Rex Peery calls the 1962
team “as good as any team we’ve
had in the last three or four years,
when we are at full strength.”
By “full strength” Peery means
having Daryl Kelvington at 137
pounds.

Although Kelvington made that
weight for Wilkes, Peery was not
impressed with his showing in the
ﬁnals when he lost to Iowa State’s
Tom Huff, 7-0.

Either Bill Solominsky or Dave
Osmun will ﬁll in at 137, .while
Kelvington advances to 157
pounds for the time being.

Says Coach

This season Gymnastic Coach.
Waren Neiger hopes to better last
year’s 2-5 record with an “im-
proved” team.

Letterman Earl McConnell is
the only senior on the squad, and
Coach Neiger expects help from
Junior lettermen John Lehner, Ed
Zamecnik, and Bob Pingatore.
Neiger also has hopes that Ed
Stim, sophomore, can continue the
ﬁne work he has displayed in
practice.

This year the Jungle Cats will
participate in six Olympic events
for the ﬁrst time. Still rings, long
horse. and floor exercise will re-
place rope climbing, tumbling,
and ﬂying rings. The other three
events will remain the same --
side horse, parallel bars, and
horizontal bars.

“It can go either way - both
