25,000 student enrollment this
year was borne out by preliminary
registration ﬁgures released last
week by the oﬁice of the Registrar.

A gross total of 28,521 students
have been registered at Pitt to
date. This ﬁgure, however, in-

    
  
  
   
  
  
  

cate registrations, so that when
these are deducted and the Feb-
ruary 1948 registrations added,
, the over-all total for 1947-48 will
"amount. to some 25,000 students,
the largest registration in the his-
tory of thejUni_Versity.
The combined ﬁgures for the
day school, ‘afternoon, evening
and Saturday classes on the cam-
,’ pus, and at Johnstown and Ells-

Death Takes
Dr. F. Bishop,
Pitt Physicist

Burial services ior the late Dr.
Frederic Lendall Bishop, 71, were
held yesterday at Homewood Cem-

Dr. Bishop, a professor of phys-

morning in his home in Fox
Chapel Manor. A

Dr. Bishop will be remembered
for his physics lectures on electric-
ity and magnetism ror engineers.
During the war years he instruct-
ed ASTP students in a similar
course. At the time he served as
director of the Pitt division of the
U. S. Army training program and
was a member of the National Co-

VA Cuts Down

A

The Veterans Administration is
preparing to alleviate the stu-
dent veteran’s registration head-
aches.

In a bulletin reviewing recent
VA regulations, the government-
revealed its intention to cut -down
on the number of forms which
vets must ﬁll out, when register-
ing.

The new plan for earning re-
ports eliminate at least two forms
each year. A

Full time students under the GI
Bill need only ﬁll out an estimate

sistence allowance will bebased
on this estimate.

Dropped under the new system
are periodic reports on earnings,
unless there is evidence that act-
ual earnings exceed the estimates.

Institutions no longer are re-
quired to submit affirmative con-
duct reports, progress and grades
to the VA. In the future reports
will list only unsatisfactory pro-
gress and discontinuance in train-
ing.‘ '

Unbroken subsistence is avail-
able to those veterans included
under the GI Bill who are study-
ing in an accelerated program.
Veterans will be credited with 15
days leave appliable to the end
of the lﬁt consecutive term of at-
tendance.

They will remain on subsistence
rolls for the entire period of_en-
rollment certified by the institu-

terms is no more than 15 days.

past the close of the last term that
the veteran attends.

ters and at the close of the school
year are deducted from the origin-
al period of education granted
each individual.

Increases for disabled veterans
in training are provided by Law
338. This law sets anew minimum
of $115 a month without depen-
dents and $135 a month with one
dependent, for those. disabled vet-
erans whose disability is rated at.
30 per cent. Those with more de-
pendents receive additional al-
lowance. " ~ _

On Sept. 1, 1947 those veterans
eligible automatiaclly receive the
new increases ‘with their follow-
ing checks.

Eligibility of veterans for the
GI Bill and Public Law 16 was
settled by Public Law 239 which
declared the end of the war as
July 25, 1947. Thus the educa-
tion and training undeigboth laws
must be completed in m'_(3!st cases
by‘ July 24, 1956. . -

Why the Doors’ Slam

Operating the elevators of the Cathedral
are some very old men. This is not news to

“ the students. That these ‘men are extremely
cantankerous at times is not news either.

- This space is being taken to urge the stu-
dents of the University to exercise more co-
operation and considerably more caution. Due

 to the largest enrollment in the history‘ of the

Cschool, larger crbwds are using the elevators
than ‘ever before. The- operators are running
with capacity loadsat all times.

This has resulted in quite ‘a number of peo-
ple having the doors closed in their faces or
else being stranded if the middle of this sky-
scraper witha class coming up in two minutes.

 Courtesy is not a. thing these men have been
using. They just don*t have the time. Conse-
quently, many mumbled remarks have been
aimed in their direction. ' .

_ It is up to us" to understand that there is

{reason for the slamming doors, short tempers
and erratic semi-express trips without stops
during the rush periods between classes.

It is up to us to keep our bodies and
clothes away from those big black doors should
they ever close suddenly in our faces.

.11: is also -up tons to relieve the situation

the library to study should use the lifts be-

If the stairs were used more,_iperhaps our
elevator pilots would be a bit more cheerful
and the service a whole lot faster.

Editor’s Note: In an effort to

“versity, the News is running the following reprint of an editorial
from the Baltimore Sun of September 26. i

Veteran’s tuition fees atthe colleges which they attend

under the GI Bill of Rights may go up to $500 but may not

exceed that amount. Some colleges have complained about
this limitation. The overhead costs of teaching, they say, plus

the wear and tear on buildings and equipment, mean that they
lose money on the training of veterans.

The
makes no such complaint. On the
contrary, if we may judge by the
ﬁgures as presented, the University
has made such a proﬁtable ar-
rangement with the Veterans’ Bu-
reau that it is operating ata sur-
plus. Moreover, if the Veterans
Bureau gives it even moremoney

year, the surplus will be much
larger. It may be large enough to

to the last semicolon. It may
mean, or the Veterans Bureau may
be construing it to mean, that a
college administration which is
smart enough to seize its oppor-
tunity. may call on the bureau to
finance its building program. It
may be that we have here an in-
sight into the management of the
Veterans Bureau which ,,-has hith-

In. any event, it is reasonably

for veterans are being used for
purposes with which most people
are not familiar. There is a ques-
tion of propriety here and per-

good thing if the Board of Re-

Purdue Official Asks U. S. O  
ToAicl College Building Plans

LAFAYETTE, lND.——(IP)—-Dr. R. B. Stewart, vice-president "and-
‘controller of Purdue University recently urged here that the Federal
government match college and university funds for provision of per-
manent non-residential facilities whenever the ‘U. S. Department of
Education finds there will be an upper-class veterans’ crisis in

of the situation,‘Dr. Stewart said

leges and universities will prob-
ably increase to approximately
2,400,000. ‘Of this number about

erans.

He also stressed the fact that
the ability to care for the enroll-
ment is deceptive, as the increase
is largely in the freshman and
sophomore classes. .

He Pointed out that here mass-
type i truction, work in exten-
sion and other emergency devices
have been employed without too
great detriment to the work level.
These methods would not be ap-
plicable when the students reach-
ed the senior college level, he said.
’ Dr. Stewart saidﬂzhat as a mini-
mum requirement, colleges and
universities will require 60 to 70-
million square feet of instructional
space to meet the demands.

He said that schools now have
some funds available for construc-
tion work, but they are not will-
ing to use their limited funds at
prevailing high prices. '

This is being demonstrated by
many announcements of deferment
of construction programs.

He emphasized that the schools

\

that this fall the enrollment in col-e

1,250,000 to 1,350,000 will be vet-

are willing to use these funds,
which are sufficient for about one-
half the present cost, and that with
the government matching these
funds, permanent structures -can
be provided to meet the instruc-
tional demands. ‘

-Dr. Stewart pointed out that the
government is just completing a
program of moving temporary

buildings to college campuses ~ to

meet housing‘ demands‘ at the cost
of about .$6 a square foot. He add-
ed. “If thegovernment will con-
tinue to provide this same -amount
per square foot and turn the
money over to us,’ we will match
it from our own funds and erect
permanent buildings that will suf-
ﬁce for the next 50 to 100 years.”

Such a program would avert a
crisis to be met when these stu-
dents reach the senior college

continued, however, to warn col-
leges and universities against di-
rect ﬁnancing of their operating
expenses by Federal Government,
which practice, he says, will lead
to loss of their freedom of opera-
tion through at least some meas-
ure of' Fé‘deral control.

Man has come back with an answer. By

After all, the classic philosophers outlined

rill Blosser-of ,“Freckles and His Friends.”

TWIRP, it seems, is an abbrevation for the

quaint phrase with a simple “v_acuo‘us"” look-

According to the writer, TWIRVP season’ is V
an answer to the “droopy new- look the girls. 0 "

is where he gets into the meat of his article.
But, we wonder‘ if he realizes the importance,
of the statement. ‘ "

It’s a sure thing that the other sex should
get something in return for denying man that

tian Diorr’s French creations may have a more
feminine look, but man iscreature of "habit.
And he is used to looking South to judge fem-
ininity. Shame on Mr. Diorr; he lowered the
Mason-Dixon line. _ ,

So much for Mr. Diorr’s fashions and the  ii
feature writer. I wonder just how this TWIRP ..

Whoever takes up the job of making the

how long it will last. For some strange reason,
fads of this sort meet an almost immediate 1
death. If Mr. Cartoonist Blosser cares to place
a small chunk of silver on the board, there
should be lots of takers. The fad would prob-
ably. last only one weekend. From then on,
it’s either TWIRP season or dating.

ong Lines  
Await Tickets  
For Symphony

by Roz Harris

 Alliroads for Pitt‘music lovers
led to the Syria Mosque Saturday

morning when student. subscrip-
tion tickets for the Pittsburgh

_ Symphony concerts went on sale
. at a ﬁrst come ﬁrst served basis.

' it The lines were the same—-—co-

eds with portable radios, blankets

to sit on, even coffee pots. I hop-
ed for a game of gin rummy but
mostof the people in line couldn’t
keep their eyes open.

It has been the policy of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Society to
set aside a day for the sale -of
student tickets at the sepcial rate
of $8.40, entitling the student to
20 cor_1_certs.

Dr. Fritz Reiner, Pittsburgh's
eminent conductor, is beginning
his tenth season Friday evening,
Oct. 24.

_Soloists for the new series of
20 evening concerts include Rob-
ert Casadesus, Artur Schnabel,
Rudolf Serkin, Claudio Arrau,
William Kapell and Ania Dorf-
Inann, Pianists. The renowned
Fritz Kreisler heads the list of

_ Violin soloists, others being Nath-

an Milstein, Zino Francescatti,
Isaac Stern and Hugo Kolberg,
concertmaster for the Pittsburgh
Symphony. Cello soloists include
Gregor Piatigorsky and Stefan
Auber, principal ‘cellist of the or-
chestra.

Due to Dr. Reiner’s pre-emin-
ence as a conductor of Wagnerian
opera, a special interest will at-

"tack to the concert version of the‘

ﬁrst act of Wag_ner’s “Die Wal-

. kuere” to be presented on Feb. 27

and 29. The Metropolitan Opera

‘ stars, Astrid Varnay, soprano; Set

Svanholm, tenor; and Mihaly
SZ_ekily, basso; are the soloists for
this special conecert.

' 5 A young American conductor,
. Ezra Bachlin, has been invited by

Dr. Reiner to appear on the po-
dium, in December. »

 
   

  
 

A river exhibit, opened officially
yesterday by the department of
ﬁne arts in its seventh ﬂoor gal-
lery, is designed to show the de-
velopment of western river boats
from the early ﬂoat types to the
present-day diesel—powered tow-
boat. A
In conjunction with this exhibit,
a series of three talks covering the
history of river boats will be given
Thursday, Oct. 23, at 8:30 p. m.
at the gallery.

_ Leland D. Baldwin,
professor of history here, will talk
on keelboating; Frederick Way,
Jr., river captain, author, and

river captain, author, and river ..

historian, will discuss the devel-

. opment of the steamboat; and El-

mer W. Easter, marine engineer
and vice president of the Hillman
Barge and Construction Co.. will
outline recent trends in river
transportation and diesel-pro-
pelled towboats. ’ I _

The exhibit, prepared by Miss
Virginia Lewis, curator, contains
over avscore of models of river
vessels ranging from the Indian
canoe, to modern river steamers;
old and new paintings of the riv-
ers and river" boats; numerous
drawings and prints showing
views of Pittsburgh from 1790 to
the present; and a large collection
of photographs.

Many of the models are replicas
of famous river boats. The “New
Orleans,” built at Pittsburgh in
1812, was the ﬁrst steamboat to
operate on the western water-
ways. This model represents the
steamer as a sternwheeler, but is
not known to this day whether the
ﬁrst steamboat was a sidewheel
of sternwheel vessel. Another of
this type, the'“Allegheny,” gained
considerable fame by operating in
regular trade on the Allegheny
River, running as far as Warren,
Pa. '

China, Oct. 10. g
_ On Oct. 10, 11 and 12 not only
the distinctiveness in design and
art distinguished the Chinese room
from other Nationality rooms but
the atmosphere was changed.
Screened of its Pittsburgh smog
and smoke, the "air took on an
oriental odor. Chinese incense,
burning for three days, ﬁlled the
air with an unfamiliar sweet-
ness. V , V
The Chinese committee headed
by Chang Wah Wee further com-
pleted the remembrance by plac-
ing a pen and ink scroll painting
above the blackboard. It is the

‘personal belonging of Mrs. Quin
Shen Yu, a member of the Chinese
Nationality room committee, who
painted the scroll.

A piece of Chinese parchment,
on which was written the story of
the oranges, was on the tray from
which the oranges were served.

Engineers deserve a break.

So think a pair of associate professors of English, Pitt's George
W. Crouch and PCW’s Robert Zetler. ‘

The result of this reasoning will come off the presses of the Ronald
Press Co. in book form, tentatively entitled: “The Engineer Has To
Write,” in February of 1948. Embodying a new idea in the teach-
ing of Engilsh to engineers, it is based on the wartime experiences

Jacob Blair of the United States
Conciliation Service visits Pitt

this Thursday to address members‘

of Men’s Debate on the practical
applications of conciliation. The
meeting is scheduled for 2 p. m.
in ‘Room 1217. ‘

Until two years ago, Blair held
a position on the Pitt faculty as
professor of economics in the field
of labor relations. Since then, his
economics background has ena-
bled him to swing directly into
the practical ﬁeld. He is now as-

sociated with the U. S. Concilia-

tion Service.

The program constitutes one of
a number of informative sessions
planned inpreparation for a series
of debates arranged with Western

Prospective members of Men’s

members of Women’s Speech As-
sociation are invited" to attend the

,Profess0rs Crouch and Zetler»
hold that the engineer needs prac-

ing he will be doing while em- -

ploye-d by industry. Their book
teaches these forms of writing
through the labors of a hypotheti— 
cal engineer, Mr. Nelson, during
his working day. .

Pitt student engineers and Eng- 

lish instructors, on whom the -idea
has been tested, are enthusiastic
over it. Not only does it demon-
strate the c.orrect way to write
articles of a technical nature but
also tells the enginer how to de-‘
liver addresses on his work. ’
This is a new idea opposed to
the old way of teaching them how
to writ.e from a literary stand-
point,
no interest in, as a rule, accord-
ing to Dr. Crouch. He also be-
lieves that instructors teaching
English to engineers should have
technical training as well as
training in composition. 0

These ideas have been presented ,

in article form in “The Journal of
Engineering Education?’ and “Elec-
trical Engineering” also with the
collaboration of Professor Zetler.‘

New Orleans,La-—(I.P.)——Dr. Howard Mumford Jones of Har-

vard University recommends the establishment of graduate colleges »
throughout the United States to meet the need for better' teachers v

for libral arts education.

Speaking before an open meeting of the Tulane graduate con-
ference on theihumanities, Dr. Jones said that the most debated ,_
point in higher educational discussions is: ‘Does the practice of the
ordinary liberal arts college me

this country give "reasonable as-
surance that students graduating
from it have been offered the ele-
ments of liberal education?”

The answer, according to Dr.
Jones, is “No.” I *

Today’s graduate schools are
nothing more than research train-
ing institutes, and are simply or-
ganizations “which create more
and more specialists at a time

when we are all seeking simplic-
ity and unity,” he said. I

Dr. Jones proposed the estab-
lishment of six graduate colleges
in the United States, with separate?‘

faculties and budgets, and a. small I

numberof carefully chosen stu-‘
dents. The purpose of these col-
leges would not be to instill,,tl1e7
proper philosophical perspective;
necessary for teaching. ~

The passing arms of Don Esaias
and John Snyder proved to be
potent medicine for the Metallurg-
ical Engineering Seniors as they
opened their IM grid slate with a
30-0 trouncing of the Civil En-
gineers Thursday on Trees Gym
ﬁeld.

With four minutes of the first
half remaining Esaias shot a ten-
yard bullet pass down the middle
to Bill Gleason, standing in the
end zone. The score at the half
stood, 6-0. The Met Seniors un-
corked a vicious aerial assault
to score four times in the second
half. » _

The ﬁnal tally came, with sec-
onds remaining, on Snyder’s short
heave to Hipp. The win placed the
Met Seniors alongside the EE Jun-
iors at the top of the Engineering
League.

Hopes;

Tackles Indiana

By Max Scherb
A hopeful Pitt Panther is sharpening his fangs this Week
in anticipation of the coming contest with Indiana at Bloom-
ington. Saturday’s game will see the Blue and Gold matched
with an opponent closed to their own size than any yet this

year.

Indiana will bring with them the Big Nine jinx which has
worked against Pitt, since the Panthers last took Wisconsin

over 26—6 in 1938. Last year the Panthers came Within a few‘

seconds of beating Purdue when the evil genie re—appeared and
the game Went in the red, 10——8.

Make no mistake about it,
ever, they are certainly not in
Notre Dame, and Illinois. Pitt

Indiana is no pushover. How-
the same class with Michigan,
can beat Indiana by skirmish-

ing thern on the same level that they attained in the first half

No Games Slated
For Frosh Team

Freshman gridders are ﬁnding
out that the road to varsity fame
is a rugged one. That much is
evident just from one frosh prac-
tice session,

The ﬁeld has no grass and the

pounding of cleats in scrimmage
kicks up huge clouds of dust which
makes it diﬁicult for the players
to see or breathe.
' And there are no games to look
forward to, for Western Confer-
ence rules forbid frosh competi-
tion. It is today, blocking practice,
tomorrow, signal drills.

Some players gripe and mutter
threats of “going South”. But
others realize that nothing that is
worth much is ever achieved with-
out paying a
price.

When frosh
practice began,
t h e average

player had a
L a d y Esther
complexion and
a Graph Zep-
pelin head. He
was a dandy
high s c h o o 1
player and. he
could produce a library of high
school headlines to prove it.

Much of that is already gone.
The grease has been taken out of
his hair, and he is learning how
to stay in one piece when,some
Emil Sitko comes roaring down
on him like the 5:15 ten minutes
behind schedule.

The hardships are paying off,
and eventually coaches Mitterling
and Hartwig hope to. turn out a
crop of players that can give and
take with the toughest of college
competition. .

against N otre Dame.

The Hoosiers sport a big beefy
forward wall that can move when

it has to. Their backs contain just.

the right elements of speed and
power, and for variation they can
call on the strong arms of halfback
Nick Sebek‘ and quarterback Rex
Grossman.

Weak in Many Places

Bo McMillen’s “Po Li’l Boys”
are as shallow as Mike Milliganfs
gridders. When an Indiana ﬁrst-
stringer leaves the game, a dread-
ful hole is left. Through one of
these holes, it is hoped a steady
string of Pitt touchdowns will
come. ‘

The men from the Wabash are
weak in other departments as well.
The Indiana secondary is causing
McMillen a lot of anguish. Full-
back Harry Jagade has not yet
proved himself a worthy replace-
ment for the great Pete Pihos.

Jagade and Center Joe Polce
have not proved themselves as the
defensive equals of the 1946 sec-
ondary, Pihos and Center John
Cannady. It is, according to Me-

Millen, his biggest worry, barring

his shallowness of reserves.

Taliaferro Leads Attack
Georgie Taliaferro is a great
scooter-back and is ﬁgured to
cause the Panther defenses a lot

of troube. Taliaferro ran 90 yards -

to ‘pay dirt for the Hoosiers
against Wisconsin but the tally
was nulliﬁed by a clipping penal-
ty.

He wasn’t discouraged by that,_

though. and stayed around long
enough to pick up 90 yards as his
total for oﬁensive play.

Nick Sebeck, reserve half, does
most of the passing for McMillen.
So far this year, Sebek has gath-
ered IO3 ‘yards in nine attempts.
Dick Darnek alternates with Sebek

I at the half slot.

Indiana doesn’t ﬁgure to be easy
but after what Pitt has been
through. nothing can look hard.
The Milliganmen want this win
bad and they’ll go all out to get it.

Dr. Held believes high school
wrestling is excellent training for
the college sport. While assistant
wrestling coach at Indiana, he
helped organize the high schools
of Indiana to compete for a state
wrestling championship.

“Professional wrestling I don't

Early Drills

While everybody keeps busy
sympathizing with Mike Milligan’s
football team and their murderous
schedule, the Panther basketball
squad has entered its second week
of practice with the same prospe
facing them. '

For the winter grind, that will
ﬁnd Pitt on the road for the ﬁrst
six games, Coach Dr. H. C. Carl-
son has only four experienced
hoopsters back. Bill Cieply,» the
only Senior on the squad, Oland
“Dodo” Canterna, Ed Latagliata,
and Sammy David should help the
Panthers through the rough slate
ahead.

A slumbering star may yet turn
up on the local basketball scene,
for all the candidates for the
squad have not yet reported to
Doctor Carlson. Not relenting, the
Pitt coach keeps the candidates
hopping from 3:00 to 6:00 p. In.
every day.

Freshman Coach Bob 'Artman

when his ﬁrst-year ﬂoormen re-

this will be published in the News.

second highest score ever record-

Reviewing the tips of the arm-

light of the 69-0 score, Panther
supporters discovered that their
team had run headlong into an
impenetrable wall of psychologi-
cal opposition as forbidding as
the four ﬂawless squads ﬁelded
by Chrisler.

The Michigan coach, who ex-
pounded the tenets of sportsman-

More than 500 spirited Pitt fans sweated under the Ann Arbor

antics of Dario Icardi as the Pan-

ther. and the hospitality of the host university.

By bus, train, and'a ﬂeet of pri-9

gave his stalwarts an unqualiﬁed
green light for scoring and deriv-
ed some satisfaction in seeing his
minions romp over the Pitt goal
more often than had Notre Dame
the week before.

Rubbing salt into the wounds
Crisler had gouged, the Michigan
‘band pushed an arch-backed pan-
ther through a meat grinder at
half time while the stadium an-
nouncer continually substituted
“tripped” for “tackled” when a
ﬂashy Michigan back hit the grid

grass under several Panther line-

men.

As the Pitt eleven tried valiant-
ly but abortively to slow the in--
cessant onslaughts of the maize

cavorting around the stadium in
Panther fur and the Pitt band
entertained with formations at
halftime and an impromptu con-
cert that kept several thousand

spectators in their seats after the

game.
