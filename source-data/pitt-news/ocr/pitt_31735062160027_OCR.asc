. Lord Balfour went on to say that
his country’s foreign policy at the
present time depends on the avail-
ability of armed forces, which in
turn depends on the productivity
of Britain’s very tight internal
economy.

“Don’t think we’re down and

MC Clamps Down
On Dinl<-Wearing‘;
Opens Doors to All

Men’s Council is determined
that all beginning freshmen wear
their dinks despite fraternity men
who encourage their rushees to
disobey MC’s rules. In his presi-
dent’s report this week Jack Bur-
winkle urged all fraternity coun-
cilmen to insist on their rushees
wearing the caps.

“I realize this is hard to do,”
he said, “because one frat can
ruin the whole works by tell-
ing -their rushees they don’t
have to wear them. ‘I don’t feel
that way and I hope you don’t
either, so let’s do our best.”

By unanimous vote Council con-
ﬁrmed the amendment to their
constitution they passed last ses-
sion, opening their meetings to the
student body.

Previously, in order to be pres-
ent at a meeting a student must
have been accepted by a vote of
the meeting they wished to attend.
The only exception to this was a
Pitt News reporter.

Another motion passed retained
Joe Trattner as freshman repre-
sentative. Made by Phil Feinert,
the motion stated that Freshman
Council be represented by their
president.

Religion Com

Do you believe that God exists?
This is a question that may be
asked you when the Religion—in-
Life committee starts its survey of
student’s religious beliefs next
week.

A 19-question poll will be given
to 400 students to determine some
of their religious attitudes. A
committee of students, ministers
and faculty personnel devised the
poll. '

To Advise Speakers

The study will be used to ad-
vise the Religion-in-Life speakers
on the subjects that students are
most interested in.

Joe Marosco, chairman of Re-
ligion-in-Life, said the committee
does not claim that the poll will
bring a scientiﬁc analysis of stu-
dent’s religious beliefs, but only
that it will be an indication to the
trend of their thinking.

The committee feels the poll was

made necessary because of the

  an itlu.-Golden Ruled

\Ask almost anyone what he thinks of the Golden Rule
and chances are good he’ll tell you it’s great. He’ll prob-
ably-add' wistfully that he wishes other people would fol-
low it, then this world wouldn’t be halfso bad.

And it is always the other guy who isn’t following the
good word; never me, always him. Because the other guy
is always breaking the Rule, a group of Christian and Jew-
ish leaders in this country have decided to hold a week for
an "examination of how many othereguys there are and

7_ what they are doing.

‘Beginning next Monday and lasting through Friday,
the nation and the University will be observing National
Brotherhood Week. At Pitt a series of t-alks, lectures and
movies have, been scheduled. ,

We hope that you give as much attention to the Brother-
hood programs as your schedule permits. At any rate We
hope that you will be as interested in hearing about the

Golden Rule as you are in preaching about it.

We doubt that Student Congress could have picked a
better man to succeed Sam Shapiro. Jim Rock has had long
experience in student activities and he is well acquainted
with the problems which face Congress.

The fact that he was the only man nominated for the
job might indicate many things. For the hopeful it might
mean that factionalism has disappeared from Congress and

0' that they are now working together inibrotherly love.

To the skeptical it might suggest a rigged election and
some behind the scenes logrolling. The validity of this will
be determined during the spring election race, when we

’ “will see who was given what to refrain from nominatin

whom. ‘
Finally, Rock’s unanimous nomination and election
could be interpreted as more evidence of student apathy

towards their elective governing body. Just another sign"

that we need ‘a “pep club” aroundhere.

Draft The!‘/Zollege Man

There are-a number of people I have a mental
block against agreeing with, but one quality of
Robert C. Ruark’s causes him to lead all the rest.

Ruark has a tendency to champion the obvious.

For example, when Ingrid Bergman was in the
news a few years ago, Ruark, after giving the
most serious thought to the problem, declared him-
self unalterably opposed to Miss
Bergman’s giving birth to an
illegitimate child.

More recently, Ruark ‘has
stunned the nation by being
against corruption in Washing-
ton.

Indeed, only one man in
America has surpassed him in
delighting the high—minded
American reading public with _
urbane jibes against the President 0 t e nited
States, dubbed by Ruark, affectionately, “Har-
ry.” That one man is, of course, outspoken Ameri-
can patriot Col. Robert R. McCormick, who scaled
the witty heights of Popeland Dryden when, with
the ﬁnese of a d’Artagnan, he rapiered Mr. Tru-
man as a “hick.” - ' _

Though a lesser genius than McCormick, Ru-p
ark characteristically appealed to the 'most sober-
minded portion of the reading public by calling
the Korean war a “poor man’s war,” because col-
lege students were not and are not being drafted
into it. _ ~
Draft Collegians

While my ﬁrst impulse is to reject this argu-
ment as short-sighted and unfair, I am forced to
admit that college students really should be drafted.

The argument for deferring them until‘ they
ﬁnish college seems at ﬁrst glance a. practical one.
It is said that students are orily being deferred,

 

‘not exempted, and that they will eventually serve

in the army, after graduation.

 
   

JACK MARKOWITZ

But, unfortunately, the war in Korea is going
on now, and the burden of it is not being carried
equally by the college student and the non-college
man. The college man will serve in the army, but
that is quite different from ﬁghting in a war.

A more persuasive argument for keeping stu-
dents in college is that a steady stream of doctors
and technicians will continue to be needed in the
years ahead. And while this is demonstrably true,
it is also true that the large ‘majority of students
are not in technical training and have very little
chance of‘ entering a medical school.

Not All Are Technicians _

A Thus a lot of people are being. kept in under-
graduate -school to feed that necessarily narrow
stream of doctors and technicians. It seems to me
that technical men and doctors themselves could
alternate their training with military duty. ,

As for the business administration and liberal ‘
arts students (I am in liberal arts), they should
be drafted. Interruption of their college education
would not cause them harm enough to justify’
keeping them in school.

Before drafting college students wholesale, one
argument, it‘ is true, should give _us pause. ‘And
that is: college students are the people upon whom
the future will depend not only for technical and.
medical training but for social and cultural 1ead- '
ership as well. _ ’

‘Yet I cannot believe that any student who has
the potentiality and ambition to lead society will
be a ‘failure in society, because he was taken out

 

_of college. A liberal education is, after all, a thing i

within the reach of people who are not liberal art:
students. Education is, in the end, self-education, 
and a feeling of‘ social responsibility is a quality 7‘;
of the individual himself. . ' -

happen before you graduate.

bly had a hard
time scraping
up

the next few weeks you groan
and dig a little deeper, dragging
out the money for textbooks. If
you’re not a vet, an athlete, or a
plutocrat who buys all his books
brand new, you probably try to
buy a used book before you are
willing to fork out twice the price
for’ a brand new book with
cleaner pages but no difference
in content.

The bookstore clerk says, “Sor-
ry, that text was revised,” and,
wincing, y ou listen, “—and
they're using the new edition in
that course now.”.

There are three chronic gripes
that students get at textbook-
"buying time.

Brotherhood Will Fail

A brotherly air will permeate
the Big Building during the com-
ing week. As you can see from

the front page, Brotherhood
Week is almost here. It starts
Sunday. .

The venture in brotherhood has
been duely heralded: posters are
going up; Jensen’s written an
editorial; ﬂyers are being dis-
tributed; campus groups have an-
nounced their backing and have
promised participation.

Brotherhood Doomed to Fail

There is, as a matter‘ of fact,
only one thing the matter with
the entire business. The saddest
think to relate about Brotherhood

Week is that it almost surely is .

doomed to failure.

The failure will occur despite -
dership, which has-

excellent lea
ult d i

 
 

 

That day or‘some day within,

   
  

One is the teacher or catalogue
that speciﬁes a text which is
never used in the course.

The second is the “experi—
menting” teacher or department
that changes the prescribed texts
almost as fast as the moon waxes
and wanes. Pitt’s psychology de-
partment, for instance, is again
using a textbook in one course
that not long ago they dropped
in favor of another work.

The third gripe sometimes can
be laid at the foot of the school
or department prescribing the
text: But most often it should be
directed against the author, who
revises and revises, frequently
changing items of small import-
ance or bringing a book “up—to-
date.”

Break From Teachers

, Teachers know this, and many
of them give us a break, using a
supplement instead of a substi-
tute. -‘

I worked last year for W. R.
Headlee, former Fifth-Avenue
book-broker. While‘ sorting dusty
books in his wa'rehouse,'I came
across an outstanding example of

,. a textbook gripe, probably famil-

iar to most Pitt students who
have had Political Science 1 and

Under the eaves there was
stack upon stack of ,“obsolete”
copies of Ogg and Ray’s “Ameri-
can Government. This book was

in its ninth -edition when the A

University dropped it last year.
Its authors. are reputed to have

0

many other features, make the
scheduled events attractive to
most.
No Change in Attitude

Despite all this, Brotherhood
Week will fail, chieﬂy because
after it is over things will be as
they were, nothing will be
changed. There is no doubt for

instance,’ that the medical school
administration will be as loudas
anyone else, if they are asked, in
their espousal of brotherhood
principles. A considerable doubt
exists as to wether or not they
will change their admission pro-
cedures. A

It is a curious paradox that
Americans, who pride themselves

on. being a practical people, are
often chanacterized by. the  A

nave wmnsn

college students at. a’ proﬁt of ]

about a buck a ‘throw.

But are the stacks of “out-
dated” seventh and eighth edi-
tions in bookstores worthless?
NO! But you’re lucky’ to get‘ a
few nickles to jingle together
when you sell “dated” books like

~ these.

How To Beat It

There are three ways to beat‘
the textbook business (or racket,
as you choose). One: be careful
to get correct information on ‘the.
required edition when buying
books. , Two: teachers should
check changes and additions
closely to ﬁnd out if they are‘
really signiﬁcant, and be slow to
change textbooks without good
reason. ‘

The third way: Why not make
quality, paper-backed books fash-
ionable again? The hardcover:
are a big expense in textbook
making. Why pay for them, espe-
cially on books that can’t avoid.
becoming dated? *

Whether a book is bbught in

copy or a $40,000 rare ‘ﬁrst edi-
tion, whether it be about new
theories in nuclear ﬁssion or the.
New Testament, the originalpur-
pose of any honest book is to
spread knowledge.

It’s a safe bet that today a per-_
version of this purpose is felt, not
in the soul, but in the wallet.

Easier Said Than Done

Neville Chamberlain’s public-
ized “peace in our time” did not
disturb the reality of a growing
armaments race, nor did the
founding of the United Nations_

erroneously thought the world

Too often, then, do we mistake-

the declaration for the achieve-

remember that it is one thing to"
talk, to proclaim, to even prom-
ise, and another thing to do.

Still, Brotherhood Week should
keep a lot of people ,busy.. A

On Road,

Battle Titans Again

By BORIS WEINSTEIN 6

V There’s no placelike home
for titan orrman. And when a
basketball team—like Pitt’s
Panthers—wins only one road in-
vasion in ﬁve tries then home
sure is sweet.

Seven of Pitt’s eight wins were
registered at the Field House this
winter——the lone road victory
was over Geneva.

Tomorrow night, though, Dr.
H.-C. Carlson’s cagers travel to
New Wilmington for their sec-ond
straight game with the Westmin-
ster Titans.

81 Straight Wins
Pitt handily won the ﬁrst con-

‘test here, 72-60, last Friday, but
, things may be different tomorrow.

The Titans, too, like their home

surroundings, and to prove it,

they’ve lost only three times in
8'9-starts. ,
Before losing to St. Bonaven-

‘ture Coach Pappy Washabaugh’s

units triumphed 81 straight times.
That streak stands as one of the
longest in collegiate history.

When the Titans moved into
new quarters this year—the Me-
morial Field House—they drop-
ped their ﬁrst three home games
since 1942. Washabaugh’s team
now has an 11-6 chart.

Out To Equal ’51 Mark

Tomorrow’s game has double
signiﬁcance for the Panthers. If
they upset the Titans it will mark
the ﬁrst time in three years that
a Pitt team has beaten an oppo-

. nent twice in a single season.

A win also will equal the num-
ber of games that last year’s team

Chuck Darling, Iowa Univer-
sity center, and Mark Workman,
West Virginia’s high-scoring cen-
ter, both rate highly in Panther
Coach Doc’ Carlson’s book. So

highly, in fact, that the veteran
mentor recommended the lads to

the ‘professional New York Knick-
. erbockers.

Both were chosen on Pitt’s all-
opponent team last year, since.
Darling was a big factor in Iowa’s
73-66 victory and Workman prov-
ed deadly in both Pitt-Moun-
taineer games. , _

However, this season the rangy
West Virginian was held to only 28
points in the Mounties’ two wins
over Carlson’s cagers.

Eight thinclads under Track

take part‘ in the Michigan State
Relays at East Lansing tomorrow
afternoon.

Besides a mile relay team that
has not been announced complete-
ly Olson will have a representa-
tive group. 4

Frank Kuzma,‘ Pitt’s greatest
distance runner since Johnny
Woodruﬁ, will be ‘represented in

the mile. Frank beat Ohio State’s
Len Truex in the Field House
meet last week with a 4229 per-
formance.

John Patellos runs in the 60-
yard dash, and Wally Monohan
participates in the high hurdles.
Dick Sorce is the lone ﬁeld hope-
ful muscling the shot put.

Olson has named three-fourths
of the relay team calling upon
Bruce Giron, Raymond Lee,‘ and

The Panther tankers show-
ed little respect for Ohio Uni-
versity’s seven straight wins
Wednesday night in grabbing their
sixth win of the season, 49-35, and
getting in shape for tonight’s meet
at Niagara.

Coach Ben Grady’s boys jumped
oif to. an early lead in an im-
pressive fashion when the 300-
yard medley relay team of Don
Fanning, Jim Zentgraf, and Ron
Gainsford set a new Pitt and pool
record with a 3:03.4 mark, erasing
the one set last Saturday by Ober-
lin. ‘

The locals led by a 24point mar-
gin after the seventh event, en-
abling Coach Grady to send in his
reserves to ﬁnish the meet with

seven of ten ﬁrst places.
The results:

Besides, Peery warns, “They’re
even better than they were last
year, especially in the 123 and
130-pound classes. Only their
heavyweight division a p p e a r s
weaker.” Last year, F & M edged
the Panthers, 14-12.

Against their only common foe

for this season, Pitt whipped Illi-
nois, 17-9, while F & M almost
duplicated the score, 17-11.
Davis To Start

Peery will start practically the
same lineup that he has used
through most of the season ex-
cept for the insertion of Dave
Davis in the 167—pound class. It
will be the ﬁrst start of the sea-
son for Davis, although as a soph-
omore he achieved a 2-4 record
last year.

The bulwark of the Pitt attack
again lies in the lightweight divi-
sion, with Hugh Peery (8-1) gun-
ning for his ﬁfth consecutive vic-
tory. '

Pitt’s probable lineup tomor-
row:

l23’pounds-—Peery (8-1)

130 pounds—Harold Miller (7-1-1)

147 pounds—-Charles Uram (6-1-2)
157-pounds——Joe~ Solomon (7-1-1)
167 pounds——Davis (9-9)

Discards From the Sports Shuﬂle

Dawson Lands Job on'Merit

By DON MURDOCK .

Sports Editor .

No handshaking, politicking, or ‘old friend’ techniques
were used to nominate Lowell ‘Red’ Dawson, Michigan State
backﬁeld coach, for the head coaching job at Pitt.

He was nominated to the post in August through
merit, experience, and ability alone.

When Len Casanova departed, the Athletic Committee
had to pick a man immediately in, order to prepare for fall

drills three weeks later.
Discovered by Schedule

Captain Hamilton wanted a man

with experience. With the football‘

season so close at hand all head
coaches were eliminated, so_assi'st-
ant coaches with head coaching

S . experience were given the prefer-

ence.

The athletic family thought

that it knew the opponents’ as-
sistants better than any others
so it began at the end of the
1950 football schedule with Penn
State.’

The University found nothing to
its liking there, so Michigan State
"was the next opponent to look over
for talent. There the present
coach’s name was found.

Here in ’34

It was Dawson’s idea to stay at

Michigan State until after the

Spartans football season ended.

With no ’ other alternative, Ham-
ilton became ‘interim’ football
coach.
. Before the August meeting
tﬂawson and Hamilton had only
met casually. In fact, the future
Panther mentor during his life-

in Pittsburgh and had never had
occasion to be close to Hamilton.

Criticisms

of Youth _

By JAMES TINTNER
Associated Collegiate Press
, All older generations have one tradition in common:
their habit .of talking about younger generations. Time maga-
zine recently carried on this tradition.

Accordign to Time, “Each

(generation) has a quality as

distinctive as a man’s accent.”¢

Maybe so. But whether or not an
older generation
feeling out these distinctions is
another question. To ﬁnd out how
other Y o u n g e r Generations—
Time’s’ for instance-—have been
sized up by the elders, we went
back to articles written in the ’20s
and "305. _

Below are some Time quotations
plus an equal number of quota-
tions about other younger gen-
erations.

Moderns Conform

Time: Tod.a.y’_s generation, either
through fear, passivity or convic-
tion, is ready to conform.

Maxine Davis in The Lost Gen-

‘volt is more ominous
radicalism.

Time: The most startling fact
about the younger generation is
its silence. With some rare excep-
tions, youth is nowhere near the
rostrum. By comparison with the
Flaming Youth of their fathers
and mothers, today’s . younger
generation is still a small ﬂame.
It. does not issue manifestos, make
speeches or carry posters. It has
been called the “Silent Genera-
tion.” But what does the ‘silence
mean? What, if anything, does it
hide?

than active

Silence a Symptom .
Forum, 1922: But perhaps their
(youth’s) scanda-lous- failure in
expression, when expression is
what they yearn for and demand
at all costs, may be a symptom of

is capable of

something deeper: of a radical

mistake they have made in their
direction of their efforts and as-
pirations.
Time:
Capote, William Styron and Fred-
erick Beuchner are precocious

technicians, but their books have
the air of suspecting that life is

long on treachery, short on re-

‘wards. What some critics took for

healthy revolt in James Jones’
“From Here to Eternity’ was

really a massively reiterated gripe .

against life. But Jones is not the
only young writer to wallow in
a world of seemingly private re-
sentments. Most of his fellow
writers suffer from what has be-

come their occupational disease:

belief that disappointment is life’s
only certainty".
Defeatist» Writing

Saturday Review of Literature,
1935: It can be said without much
likelihood of contradition that
the middle generation of Ameri-

‘can writers have diefeatist written
‘of their foreheads.

Time: In real; life, youth seems

,to know, people always drop the
ball. Youth today has little cyn-
Licism, because it never ‘hoped for

much.
Literary Digest, 1927: Can you

;be surprised if a generation, rob-

bed _of its youth, with its ideals
empty as blown bubbles around

it, turned_ for a time to a mood of ;

pessimistic cynicism . . . The mood
has passed, and the younger gen-
eration is attempting soberly to
adjust itself to this bruised world.

5‘ Editor-Critic’s Desire

For ‘esire’ Cash Flops

By ED JENSEN
ASPHALT AND DESIRE by Fred-
eric Morton; Harcourt, Brace
and Company; $3.00.

The Youth who populates the
literary world is traditionally a
restless, insecure and ambitious

individualist, tormented W i t h
doubts aboutleverything from the
morality of the atomic bomb to the
"legitimacy of his birth. In his hy-
persensitive way he is eternally
preoccupied with resolving his
place in society, in his family or
justin his owngmind. ,
Once upon a time this Youth
was always a man‘ but now that
jwomen have been emancipated
and _can earn as much as men and
often drink as much, it has been
discovered that they, too, have

A their ‘hopes and fears, not all of

them relatedto bringing up chil-
dren and keeping house.

A Troubled and Free

Iris Leavis, the heroine of As-
phalt and Desire, is one of these
emancipated Youths who has
more than her burden of inner
and outer conﬂicts. Frederic Mor-
_ton takes her troubles up on her
last day at Hunter college and
leaves her ﬁve days later.

,During these ﬁve days she
metamorphoses. from the sophis-_
ticated virgin editor of the Hun-
ter College Bulietjin to the chas-

-itened, deﬂowered, graduate who
has made‘ her peace with the
world. We are not exactly certain
whether she has made peace with
her family nor are we certain that
she has come to terms with her
conscience.

Iris starts out as an ambitious

graduate—-—a little resentful that‘

her degree is not from Vassar-

‘with every sophomoric cliche in‘

the book and determined to inﬂict
herself on the -masthead of one of
the leading slick magazines. She
spurns two earlier job oﬁers be-

A cause they are dull and offer her

only the opportunity to meet some

junior executive and get married,

a prospect which makes her shud-
der. She is out for bigger game.

Sex Is a Device -

Inihe pursuit of this “big time”

job, she offers her" most valuable

A ’ possession to a predatory publish-

er and then in a moment of what
she calls bourgeoise moral panic,
she ﬂees and loses her “in” with
her possible patron.

\ Next she hits upon the scheme

~ of shacking up in a hotel and writ-

ing an inside expose, this in order
to gain attention. The deal ﬁzzles
out and sheremains pure for a
few more pages. By the way, her
virginity is one of the devices the
-author uses to keep interest; he
lets you know she is going’ to lose
it but he doesn’t tell you when.

v ,Finally she meets an “earthy” _ ‘A

«man who, while he admires her
mind in‘ passing, is more interest-
ed in her body. In the simple rus-
tic surroundings of a New Jersey
summer camp, far away from the
asphalt of. New York and the stric-
tures of civilization, he wins her.

This straightens her out and she

knows then that she is just an-
other college graduate. ‘ »

During her ﬁve day quest ‘of

, fame Iris conducts a running war

with her family which is socially a
member of the petit bourgeoise, if
that is important. They are not on
good terms as you might guess.
A Tedious Book

But it is only in those passages
where he deals with Iris’ parents
that Mr. Morton shows any writ-
ing talent or understanding of hu-
man beings. They are the only liv-
ing, breathing characters in the
book. The rest are a collection of
posturing, attitudinizing fresh-
men, both in their thinking and
talking. All of them are literary
ﬁgures, culled from books and not
from real life. , *

Mr. Morton takes us on long and
tedious ﬂashbacks into Iris’ aca-
demic life and childhood, neither
of which tell us much. They
should have been left out.’ The
dialogue is a dreary attempt at wit
andsounds highly improbable, al-
though this may not be so.’

Atedious book, it is outrageous-
ly juvenile and aimed at second
semester high school seniors.
There is no reasoniwhy any of us
should read it. I -read it because
there is a $50,prize for the best
review which, as.you can see, I
don’t stand a ghost of a chance of
winning.

 
 

Three Armed Services Recruit
Women for Officer Training

University Women will probably ﬁnd _it easier to get
commissions in the armed forces than their male counter-

parts.

yardbirds, all four of the militarye

services are courting the coeds
with officer programs.

The Pitt military department‘

will accept applications from sen-
ior women and recent graduates

six-week summer periods at Quan-
tico, Va. Seniors, and graduates
may take a continuous 12-week
summer course. Upon completion
of the course or attainment of the
age of 21,.whichever comes ﬁrst,
the women marines will receive

 
 

While most ‘non-ROTC men will enter the service as

their commissions.
Navy Course Offered

The navy officer course is of-
fered at Bainbridge, Md. Since
neither the navy nor the marines
have contingents at the University,
coeds can obtain further informa-
tion at the Old Post Ofﬁce Bldg.
