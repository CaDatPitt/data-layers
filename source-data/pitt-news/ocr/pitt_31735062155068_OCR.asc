Calls for ‘Rational Foreign Policy’ . . .

Morgenthau at Midday  

By JOEL BEELER

Calling for a “rational
foreign policy,” Professor
Hans Morgenthau of the
University of Chicago at-
tacked the major dilemmas
of American foreign policy
at Wednesdays Midday ser-
ies lecture.

Addressing a capacity crowd
of about 700, Dr. Morgenthau, au-
thorvof the book “Prolitics Among
Nations," stressed ﬁve primary
areas: the allies, the Communist
world, .the free world, the nu-
lear threat, and the eﬂects 0
American domestic events on
foreign relations.

Regarding the allies, Morgen-
thau called for a reassessment of
the United States policy towards
NATO; for the rise of several nu-
clear powers has changed the
conditions under which NATO
could function as an effective
Western policy instrument.

Policentrism, or the emergence
of independent centers of Com-
munist power, necessitates a. com-
Dleted reevaluation of American
Policy towards the communist na-
tions, Morgenthau asserted. Citing
three seprate groups of Com-
mllllist Dower (those subserviant
to the Soviet Union, those sub-
serviant to Communist China,

» and those subserviant to none),

M0!'Eenthau explained that each

Students and faculty mem-
bers of the University can have

Cathedral. The oﬁice hours are

Activities Fee

Approved by

Monnett, assistant chancellor

that time, the proposal must then
receive backing by the student
body.

Committee member John Vrana
said that the activities fee idea
received strong support at a
meeting of the committee on
Tuesday. At that time, he said,
Harvey Lefton suggested that
Monnett be queried at the Stu-
dent Affairs meeting about how
tuition money is spent. In this
way, said Lefton, students may
better understand if an activities

would be used.“ A S

cast 65% of their vote for
President Lyndon Johnson.
However Republican Sena-
tor Hugh Scott soundly
trounced his Democratic
opponent, Miss Genevieve
Blatt.

With only 905 students
participating (nearly 500
less than in 1960), Johnson
received 608 votes to Sena-
tor Barry, Goldwater’s 269. At
this point many students must
have split their ballots because
the Senate vote was 596 for Re-

 

 

publican Scott and 280 for Miss. 3 A’

Blatt, who received the endorse- ‘

ment of President Johnson.
Students also failed to support

the Democratic candidate for) A

State Treasurer, Thomas C. Mine-
hart. Minehart lost to Republi-
can Robert D. Fleming, 418-381.

But the Democrats swept the
rest of the state offices. Grace

M. Sloane defeated the Republi-. ‘S 1

can candidate W. Stuart Hehn by

a vote of 445 to 338. 

Democratic nominees for Su-

perior Court Judges, J. Sydney‘, 

Hoffman (339 votes) and Robert
L. Jacobs (278), won in a tight

race over the Republican candi-' 

dates Robert E. Woodside (275)
and Joseph Bruno (227).

In the past, mock elections at
the University have paralleled
the results of the actual elections.

In 1960, John Kennedy received»

ciety and praised Pittsburgh for
its civic improvement projects.
“Not many years ago,” he said,
“Pittsburgh was a worn out, old
city — known more for its waste
than its wealth, more for its
slums than its skyscrapers, more
for its polluted rivers than its
precious resources. Its skies were
blackened with smoke. When you
saw the blue it just meant the
mills were down and people were
hungry. Then you got to work.

“Today, Pittsburgh is a city of
clear skies, of clean buildings,
uncluttered streets, lovely parks
and beautiful homes.

“To those who want to repeal
the progress of our times, I say—-
let them come and take .a good
look at Pittsburgh! To those who
want to repeal the whole idea of
people working together-through
government where necessary —
say let them come and look at
Pittsburgh!”

Then lashing into his opponent,
Senator Barry Goldwater, who
he never mentioned by name,
added, “The opposition canidate
has voted to cut out or cut down
almost every program of com-
mon responsibility for anything-
from national defense to educa-
tion to Social Security.

“He voted against urban re-
newal, against low income hous-
ing, against arm redevelopment,
against aid to education. But

these are things that have helped
rebuild Pittsburgh. They will
help build the Great Society.

(For a. defense of Goldwater's
voting record, see column page 4.)

Senator Goldwater for his votes

government, responsible govern-
ment — is the people. That’s
what this election is all about—
the responsibility of people, act-
ing together, to keep peace in the
world and prosperity here at
home.

“The opposition candidate pro-
tests that the issues are not be-
ing drawn in this campaign. Me-
thinks he protest, too much.”

Continuing, he explained that
the most serious and basic issues
have been drawn—“in our votes
for and his votes against: the Civil
Rights Act, the Trade Expansion
Act, the mass transit bill, the
Wilderness Bill, and even the war
on poverty.

“These are all issues in this
campaign. They are not issues
that divide Democrats and Re-
publicans.”

President Johnson reminded
the audience that Senator Gold-
water voted 25 times in the past
four years against major pro-
posals which were a part of the
1960 Republican Platform, and
were supported by a majority of
Republican Senators.

Explaining the Great Society,
he said, “It is when America’s
promise and her practice come
together. It isn’t .a dream of the
mind. It’s as real as tomorrow,
and it is yours for the working
at it.”

Morgenthau Speaks to 
On  Dilemmas of Foreign  
Policy; Stresses Domestic

(Continued from Page 1)
that the United States must not
treat th as a monolith.

Speaking of the fragnentation
of the world since World War II,
Morgenthau stressed that ‘‘today’s
battle is in the uncommitted third
of the world. Both sides want to
win the struggle for the minds
of man.”

Morgenthau also asserted that
the United States would fail in
foreign policy if it could not
come to terms with the problem
‘of nuclear power. Proclaiming,
“We can’t gamble on war any

more,” he explained the basic
difference between the pre-World
War II times and now: then, war
was a rational instrument of
policy; today nuclear war would
result neither in winning nor los-
ing, but in ultimate destruction.

Lastly, Dr. Morgenthau attack-
ed the problem of the increased
role of domestic events in for-

eign aﬁairs. In an age in which

warfare has become as much psy-
chological, as physical domestic
affair, according to Morgenthau,
become a critical aspect of for-
eign policy.

_, _, _ Notably the first inland instituti'on to take such a step, the Uni-
:»:.:tyfersity has recently announced an oceanography program to examine
 the almost untouched frontier of ocean water and its material resources.
“With av$395,000 grant from the Sarah Mellon Scaife Foundation, this
..',»o._a}’1nbitious program will interrelate several schools of the University
fosimilar to the inclusiveness of the Spare Research Program.

,  It is pecisely this kind of venture that is giving the University a
rrame of leadership among institutions of higher learning. An inland
gj ‘oceanography program, a space research center, the trimester system,
 -the regional campuses, the very architecture of the Towers dormitories
f are novel and exciting not only to the student body and proud alumni
 but to a century whose value system is based on expansion.

 Thomas M. Cooley, III, dean of the University Law School announced

Cooley remarked that he had had every intention of doing so but since
he had recognized certain problems within the Law School to be unsolv-
able, he had been looking for an opportunity to resign. . '

He cited the primary handicaps in the Law School area as short-
age of appropriations for library resources, salaries, student aid, and space.

The man who made these statements was not an idle dreamer.
Since he came here in 1958, his school, which had been last among Penn-
sylvania law schools on Bar exams, has since placed first three out of
ﬁve times. The percentage of students passing the exam on the ﬁrst
try has not fallen below 80 per cent in contrast with 29.1 per cent in 1958.

The weaknesses in the Law School cited by Dean Cooley points
out an inconsistency of rationale in University expenditure: funds are
available to begin new expansion but not to strengthen a base of exist-

any federal law per se.

A perfect example of’ this
philosophy i'n action occur-
red in 1959 as a result of
the now famous McClellan
committee’s’ investigation of
labor racketeering.

Serving on this commit-
tee were Senator Barry

. Goldwater and Senator John

Kennedy. Chief counsel for
the committee was Robert
Kennedy who wrote his best
selling book, The Enemy
Within, based on his experi-
ences as counsel.

The investigations disclos-
ed a shocking picture of cor-
ruption in some union lead-
ership. The overthrow of
Dave Beck as president of
the Teamsters Union was a
result of the McClellan com-
mittee’s work.

The committee’s effort
was bipartisan and public
opinion for a strong bill to
curb the abuses uncovered
by the committee couldn’t
have been stronger. »

‘ Yet in April of 1959 when
the committee’s bill, the

‘Kennedy, ,-. Ervin bill, .. was

' headed for a_ final vote, com"-
 ‘-_-Illélflbegrr .. Goldwater». ->

-said? that the effect the bill

’ _wou1d'have on correcting the

problem “is like «a flea bite
on a bull elephant.”
The Senate vote was 90

5 for the bill and one against

z;'Go1dwater. ’

  ._INSTEAD or saying that,  
_“the bill isn’t exactly what

I want but some legislation
is necessary and is being
demanded by the public,

therefore I’ll vote -for the ~

bill.” Goldwater said, “The
end result of this bill in its

present form will be to‘ mis-f
lead the A?'m‘erican»public in-'

to the false belief that ade-
quate measures have been
adopted to cope with the

i evils they abhor.”

In August of that same
year, 1954, President Eis-
enhower went on television
to speak on labor reform.
“The bill which passed the
Senate in April is not effec-
tive,” he said. .

During this time, the House

of Representatives had been
working on its own labor re-
form bill. This bill, The
Irandrum-Griffin bill, was
a much tougher bill than
the Kennedy-Ervin bill. A
joint Senate-House commit-
tee approved of the Lan-
drum-Griffin bill and sent
it to the Senate floor as a
substitute for the Kennedy-
Ervin bill.

The vote was 95 for and
two against. This time Gold-
water was in the majority.

IN THIS instance, Sena-
tor Goldwater’s refusal to
go along with.the crowd was
vindicated. . ..

This does not mean that

or even most of his protest '
votes, but it does show that
he voted in this manner to
take a definite stand against A
what he felt were basic er-
rors in the general trend of
the federal govemmnt.

 Sullivan .Mason Act 

nynannrinmnrmm

Many big ‘news stories have broken over
theopast few weeks. The sheer occurrence of

’ this rash of major events has initself be-
‘ come a newsworthy item. Amid the Khrush-

chev ouster, the Red Chinese bomb, and the
fate of Walter Jenkins, many other signifi-
. cant items and new ideas
have been relegated to back
pages. _
The idea of incentive
pay for government em-
. ployees as proposed by
comedian Jackie Mason on
the Ed Sullivan show last
Sunday, for instance, ranks
ﬁrst among the back page
revelations.
Before Sullivan ﬁred
Mason, hereby cancelling

 

" Mason’s contract for ﬁve more shows this

season, the comedian" managed to slip in a
fewchoice lines. One which stood out in
particular was his suggestion on balancing
the budget and cutting down on the national
debt. Masonsated that congressmen, wheth-
er the budgetcomes out in the black or
black-'and-blue, receive their salaries. Possi-

- bly they would show more concern, he form-.

ulated, if they were placed on commission.
Sullivan hurried Mason off the stage
before the audience heard the details of the

,comedian’s master plan.

I STILL DON’T know what kind of
incentive program Mason had in mind for
our national legislators, but the Associated

New York City.

The headline on the story" reads, “School
Custodian Earns $46,130 . . . Gross Gets
Only $45,003’ Dr. Calvin E. Gross is super-
intendent of Schools for New York City.

The custodians are civil service em-
ployees who hire their own help and buy
supplies from a lump-sum allowance. The
allowance is based upon the size of the

school building and the number of extra-

hour activities.

WHAT THE "CUSTODIANS do not
spend for operation and maintenance, they
retain for themselves.

In" all, a dozen custodians earned more

more than $30,000 last year, with 870 cus-
todians averaging $14,400. —

ASSUMING THAT the custodians are
not scrimping, and are takingoproper care
of their schools, comedian Mason would
likely praise the idea of such a commission
program for government employees;

Different restrictions, however, would
have to be placed on the lump sum allow-
ances granted congressmen. , ‘Even if na-
tional representatives were granted a fixed
allowance which would cover their state
expenses, {proportional share.=Qf._ the_.;1;a.tional

Although academic dishonesty on campus has re-
ceived a great deal of emphasis lately, the area of «non-‘
acadernic ‘di§honeIsﬁ'7'”at""tlié" ‘University’”i‘em§.ins‘"laJrgely‘"" ”

unpublicized.

Yet, thefts of all types, ranging from a $250 buffing
machine stolen from the cafeteria to food taken from re-.

frigerators in the dormitories, have taken place in various '

areas of the University.

Inthe cafeteria, for example, almost 2000 knives have-
been stolen since school began. Multiply each knive by its
90c cost and the ﬁgure comes to nearly $2,000. ‘

Students doirtseem toteelthat they arecommitting a crime,
however, when they takesilverware. one freshman girl summed up
the students’ philosophy when she said, “No easier to steal from
the inditution than from your friends.” ~

Dr. Merle Moskowitz, associate professor of psychology, explain-
ed this reasoning: “C'neating_fr-om impersonal organizations has be»
come almost accepted in our culture.” He illustrated this theory by
pointing to the frequency with which hotel. souvenirs are stolen.

“People have a feeling that the more impersonal an organization
is, the more it is out to get the individual.” In saying this, Dr. Mosko-
witz, indicated that the individual then feels he has a right to re-
taliate.

Thedonnitoriesarethesceneofmanyinstancesofminorthefta
of food and money. one cunning trick is to jam-up a coke machine
with empty bottles and wait for a few persons to fruitlessly insert
their dimes. The thief returns later, uniams the machine, and makes
of! with the ioot—free drinks.

Captain Charles Ray of the University police force stated that
larceny on campus is confined to mainly purses and articles of cloth-
ing, but these thefts could be committed by light-ﬁngered artists in
the Oakland area other than students. At dances, however, which are
conﬁned to the students, objects have disappeared, which presumably
have been taken by other students.

Mrs. Elma Pickering at the Information Desk in the Cathedral
pointed out that the number or pencil sharvﬂiers stolen from various
oﬂices two years ago necessitated all pencil sharpeners being locked
in drawers from that time on.«-.,Whcu  Pickering was on vacation,
someone even took her plastic correspondence basket.

Dean of Students Helen P. Rush declared, “I could never believe
that there is a major problem of dishonesty.” But the thefts, however
minor, still are occurring, and the academic calibre of the University
does not erase their frequency.

Dr. Thomas Gold, of Cornell University,
who delivered a Philosophy of Science lec-
ture Wednesday night at Clapp Hall, dealt
with the topic of “Time” from thermody-
namic, cosmological, physical and philo-
sophical considerations. He is co-formulator
of the Bondi-Gold “steady-state” theory of
cosmology. That theory hypothesizes spon-
taneous accretion of matter to maintain the
universe’s constant density as it expands.

According to Dr. Gold, humans have a
strong impression of sliding along an in-
exorable time coordinate. Yet how, Gold ask-
ed, does this come about? How are we aware
of past and future as a time-arrow?

Suggested relationships of the uni- ‘
verse’s subunits, constituting the laws of
physics, can conceivably proceed in either
time direction, and can be described in re-
verse. This property is known as “time-
symmetry.”

We casually associate the beginning of
physical process with its more ordered state.
In fact, this is exacted how we temporally

order it. The problem of awareness of the
time-arrow, which Dr. Gold had raised,

.— ‘air;
at

finds an answer in the sense
in which the world operates
in one direction, is “asym-
metrical.” Electromagnetic
radiation expands, as does
the universe as a whole.
Hence it is pressed upon us
that asymmetry on the hu-
man level is an actual fact.

The actual universe is
time-asymmetrical, although
laws of physics are not.

A person exists as a par-
ticular item in time, having

. a certain coded relation with

representations of exterior
informations. Experience,
when considered as memory,
reduces to a “higher quality
computation” of successive
states of disorder (entropy).
The future, on the other
hand, manifests a statistic-
ally inferior quality. This
is the difference. It ap-

ships because of the uni-
verse’s expansion.

When there is no motion
in a closed system, there is
no time for that system, as
there is no order change. In
that case it would be impos-
sible to have a memory of
the system.

Dr. Gold hypothesized a
situation consisting of nor-
mal process order reversal,

as in the case of a contract-'

ing instead of expanding
universe. In this condition,
evolution and growth pro-
ceed backward, with corre-
sponding reverse entropy,
spectral blue-shift, and with
isolated states statistically
increasing their order. It
would violate no rule but
that of “common sense,”
Dr. Gold said.

They are deep and fully drawn by Maugham and
adequately transposed to the screen. -

Laurence Harvey does not have an easy.-role
‘as the hero.'lIe.plays a confused and easily-in
licenced man who is burdened. mentally‘ and 
021117. by a clnbfoot. His battle is to.f1"ee'himself
from a love aﬂair. He knows is wrong for him and
to Adedolate himself to a career in medicine. which

 The actor must build in”a"fé\'17‘sce1Ies*what *'

writer has taken many pages and months to create.
Harvey's approach is quite straightforward and
calm. The result is a strong performance with many
interesting subtleties. ' - '

Kim Novak, as the temptress, is not quite as
successfuL though her role is less complicated. Skill-
ful direction and camerawork, however, have helped
her to attain her best performance to date.

The secondary. -characters are another high
point of the story. and a ﬁne cast represents them
well in the ﬁlm. Robert! Merely, for one, in his
usual brief and memorable appearance, is a cranky,
old doctor whose quick wit adds comic relief to the
depressing story. For example. he adminishes a
young medical student for not shaving: “You’re
halfway tobecoming a hairy failure.”

Of Human Bondage is a rather sad story, set
in some gloomy “London locations. The movie creates
the somber and dejected mood in stark and natural-
istic fashion. Good ﬁlm technique has nicely com.
Dlimented a well-told story. A capable cast com-
pletes the fomiula for a solid motion picture.

‘Soccer Tedm Plays      

Top Rated Maryland
For NCAA Position

By BILL CABIN

The soccer team faces one of its strongest opP0I1eY1tS When it
plays Maryland University tomorrow at 1:30 pm. at Forbes Field-
The Terrapins boast a powerful attack and have outscored their
opponents 27-8, while compiling a 4-1 mark.

“I expect Pitt to be improved,” said Maryland coach Doyle
Royal, “and I expect a good close game. It will probably be a battle

1 1 of offenses, but our defense has also done exceedingly we .”
The Terrapins downed previously undefeated Georgetown 11-0

on Wednesday.

The Panthers will also have a well-balanced attack for the game.
“Our offense is well-distributed,” s_aid_coach Leo Bemis, “and every
lineman has scored.” The booters have outscored their opposition

21-13, and hold a 4-2 record.

“Our defense will also be improved.” said Bemis. “since full-
 backs Art Richardson and Jim)? Cuddy will return to the squad."
Richardson missed most of the Grove City game because of a bruised
hip. Cuddy, who has been out several weeks with a pulled muscle,
is not a probable starter, but will be available.
Although Bemis feels the booters still have a Chance for the
NCAA playoffs, two losses in the four remaining games could ruin
their hopes. “If we lose two more games,” said Bemis, “we'll P1‘0b-

ably be out of consideration.

“However, even if we end with a 6-4 record, there's a chance we
might still get a bid.” The reason the booters might get a bid with('§pi_Litt1e who will also make the
I "a 6-4 record is because the Saylor Point System is used to allot play-

off berths.

According to the Saylor System, each team on 9, particular team’s
schedule is rated by their winning percentage. A team with .750 or
higher gets an “A” rating, one with .500—.'l49 percentage gets a “B”
rating, .250—.499 warrants a “C” rating, and any percentage below

that is a. “D’ rating.

, After the teams on a schedule are rated, the team whose sched-
' ule is being considered gets a certain number of points for winning,
losing, or tying a team of‘ a certain rating. The three district teams
with the highest point total get berths.
“Because teams are chosen by the Saylor System,” said Bemis,
“our chances depend on what other teams do. It could come down
to the Penn State game "for the ﬁnal decision.” Penn State, now 3-2,
is the booter’s Last opponent, and play here on November 31.

Against Mountaineers

The cross country team risks its perfect record against
the West Virginia Mountaineers tomorrow at Morgantown.
Coach Jim Banner’s squad has defeated Slippery Rock,

p 15-50; Penn State, 19-36; Ohio State, 20-44; and Kent State
‘and Ohio University, 31-36-64 in a triangular meet. West

Virginia has a 1-4 record.
‘-‘West Virginia has Ralph Mor-
isey, one of the best runners to
ever come from a Pittsburgh

Morissey, a graduate of Central
Catholic, contributed to the Moun-
‘taineers’ win over the Panthers
"last year as he ran the 4.2 mile
course in 22:50. For the last two
seasons the Mountaineers have

Meet Syracuse 

 

In Sectional Rivalry

Orangemen
Top in East

Many things point to a
rough game for the Pan-
thers when they travel to
Archbold Stadium for the
game with Syracuse tomor-
row. One is that the seniors
on the team haven’t beaten Pitt
as the‘ Panthers have won the
last two years. Also, Syracuse is

going for the Lambert Trophy
and they need a win over Pitt.

Syracuse was r.ated the top
team in the East in pre-season
polls and the Panthers were rated
ﬁfth. This would automatically
make the Panthers the underdog.

There are two players, one named » 1

Jim Nance and the other Floyd

Panthers nine point underdogs

Little is only .a sophomore and
has started his career with quite
ﬂash of greatness. In the Kansas
game Little scored ﬁve touch-
downs. “He is most ‘effective on
kick-offs and punt " returns al-

-though he is fast enbugh to breaj;

scout Darren Lewis.

If Little is so good on punt re-

S Dricveco

By Msuvnv znucdwrrz

  
 
  

During a football game in his junior year at Redstone

Mazurek recalled the October

night when his team defeated
- German Township, 17-0. “I didn’t
feel too good for .a while,” Ma-
"zurek said. “Then, all of a sud-
jt. den I got this terriﬁc pain in
 head and I had to leave the
iﬁeld.

“Then everything got dark. I

don’t remember what happened

for a while after that,” he con-

ztinued. “I just know I was semi-
.. conscious.”
 , For the next two weeks Ma-
azurek was on the critical list.
_}'1‘wo weeks after that he was
»  

Teachers call this quality of

‘:'.Mazurek’s tenacity or persever-
 ance. Football coaches'have an-
=other name for it-—guts. And it
‘is just that same kind of guts
;that might result in the Pitt quar-
' ligterback gaining All-America hon-
ors.
:_ Mazurek may he All-America. ‘-
because he never quits. Even as
fa sophomore, when he was the
fseoond unit quarterback behind
. Jim Traﬁoant. he  -  — - - 
in the Notrelna_-no-zametthar
year he had tdboi to play.
'Mazurekhadbeenintheball f
game with the defensive” sec- A
.ondary when Notre Dame scored
a touchdown. Mazurek was sup-

posed to leave the playing ﬁeld.
but he wanted, to stay in the

‘game. He asked a junior halfback
to let ‘him play, but the half-
jback wouldn't leave the ﬁeld; he
"did not want“ to pass up the op-
‘portunity for glory. Then the
‘ -_ same halfback did Mazurek ‘a
"V favor by asking senior halfback
fEd Clark to leave the ﬁeld. Clark A

obliged. Mazurek returned the

‘kickoﬂ 93 yards for a touch-
down.

Coaches who send their teams

against Pitt’s ﬂying ﬂash rave

about him. After Pitt’s 17-12 loss
to UCLA earier this year, Bruin

_coach Bill Barns called Mazurek,

“Tremendous. He’s just a.wonder—
‘ful football player. He has great
speed, he's a . ﬁne passer, and

 High Schol, Fred Mazurek suffered a blood clot on the
_. brain. Some doctors thought he would not live. Others said
ihe was through playing football. College football coaches
 held their breath. And the Mazurek family prayed. But
four weeks later, wearing a little leaguer’s protection hel-

met, Mazurek led Redstone to

4, its opening game basketball vic-
_ tory by scoring 25 points.

he's an exceptional runner. I’d
say Mazurek is one of the best,
if not the best, pass-run quarter-
back in the country. I know this.
He’s the best I've ever seen.”

When Barns calls Mazurek the
best pass-run quarterback in the
country, he is including his own
pass-run quarterback, Larry Zeno,
who happens to be among the
leaders in total offense, and a
strong contender for All-Ameri-
ca honors. Barns never mention-
ed Zeno when he spoke about

% Mazurek, but when asked, he ad-

mitted that he thuoght, “My boy
boy is pretty good, too.”

Passing and running are_ the
two ways of piling up yardage,

, and Mazurek piles yardage like

it was a year-end close-out. Last
year he completed 58 per cent
of his passes for 949 yards. He
rushed for another 646 yards.
These statistics are amazing in
view of the fact that he only
ﬁgured in 259 plays.

Mazurek. has been almost as
successful this year as last. In

 games he has accumulated .
 ' yards or total oﬂense. He‘

completed _ 56 per cent of his
passes for 505 yards.
(In spite of these figures, some

IIID MAZUBE

fans have criticized Mazurek for
carrying the ball too much. Even
some of the players are now takv
ing part in these rumblings. But
a check of the statistics show Ma-
zurek has only run the ball. on
approximately one out of three
plays.

. (He has carried the ball 74
times, while fullback Ba/rry Mc-
Knight has carried the ball 65
times, and the two halfbacks,

.Dale Stewart and Eric Crabtree

hawecarried the ball 62 times.)

Mazurek isn’t supposed to be
one of the‘ better passers in the
country, but he smiles when he
talks about it. “I don’t know
how they rate passers,” he grin.
Bed. “but I $n’t be the worst.

ta Make im All-American

Do they go by how hard you
throw or by how many you com-
plete.”

If fans judge quarterbacks by
how hard they throw, Mazurek

would have trouble holding his

own with 3 rubber band. Maybe
they judge quarterbacks on how
many passes they complete.

“I completed 57 per cent last
year,” Mazurek said. Then he
smiled. “I guess that’s not too
bad. And I’m doing about the
same thing this year.”

Mazdrek then went on to re-
fute claims about his rubber-
band arm. “I can throw harder,”
he said. “I just never get to
throw when I’m set. I'm always
running when I throw, so I’m off
balance a lot. Sometimes I even
have to throw sidearm.”

Mazurek speaks as freely about
his running as he does about his
passing. He knows he's good. And
he shly admits it. “I guess rm
a pretty good runner. At least,
that’s what they all say,” he said,

lviazurek describes himself as a_
V shifty nmner and has been suc-

cessful in evading tacklers. He
has 394 yards total rushing of-
fense in his ﬁrst six games this
season.

Mazurek knows he has a chance
to become All-American, and he
wants it. “You have to want to

be the best when you play,” he__
said. “If you don’t you might as

well give up.

“I think every kid wants to be
an all-American. If I didn't want
to be all-America, I wouldn’t be
playing here.”

“We still have four games to
play, and if we don’t win, I don’t
stand much of a chance.”

Fred Mazurek is already the 

best offense quarterback in Pitt’s
history. And he has outgained
such great backs as Bimbo Cec-
coni and Marshall Goldberg.

He" might be the best back in
Pitt history.

Interview:

, By JOEL BEELEB
Professor Hans Morgenthau, the father of
the Realist School of International Relations,
visited campus last Wednesday to give a
Midday Series lecture. (See story page 1).
>Dr. Morgenthau, you have called for contain-
ment of Communism as the best foreign 1301103. In

regard to this, how can you justify American with-
. drawal from Vietnam?

I think you have somewhat misquoted me. I

have always said that military containment Of the

Soviet Union in Europe is necessary and has been
eminently successful. But one of the mistakes of

’ ‘ Dulles era was to extend this policy of military con-

tainment to the rest of the world, where it couldn’t
work. . . . Containment of China has always been
a very dubious proposition. . . . Our decision will

I. ‘make good only if we go to war with, China or re-

treat. The war in Vietnam cannot be won by mili-
tary means, short of extermination of the Vietna-
mese people. The only problem whe have is not how

 g to win the war but how to get out of it.

>wou1d you advise, then, that we give all of

I ' Southeast Asia to the Communists?

This is not the problem. You don't give Smith-
'east Asia up necessarily to the Communist. You
give it up to predominant Chinese inﬂuence-—and
this is inevitable considering the geographical pop-
ulation, cultural, and economic factors, just as it is
inevitable for Latin America to be inﬂuenced by the

I colossus to its north.
‘ >Do you have anything to add to YOU!‘ 110011-

words which tend to obscure reality. You cannot
share the ultimate decision as to whether or not YOU
want to commit suicide in a nuclear war. Either
you have it, or somebody else has it, but you can’t
have it together.

> Dr. Morgenthau, what are your views about
the United Nations?

As far as the U.N. is concerned, you have a
very difficult situation, due to the enormous prolifer-
ation of legally equal nations who are extremely
unequal in power and in resources-—-most of whom
are not really viable at all.

The wisest thing to do would be to change the
procedures of the U.N. so that there are more com-
mittees which make the real decisions (ratiﬁed by
the General -Assembly), rather than the General
Assembly itself talking about everything. The U.N.
is a very important instrument for keeping peace
and mitigating international conﬂict. It needs all
the support We can give it——especially insofar as
the peace-keeping forces are concerned.

>You’ve spoken consistently of rationality in
foreign policy, Dr. Morgenthau. How is rationality
to be achieved in the United States, when decision
makers must respond to public opinion? -

What you see here is a fundamental misunder-

standing about the nature of public opinion and

its relationship to democratic decision making. . . .
For a president to wait until public opinion gives
him the sign to do something he'd like to do, but
is afraid of doing because of public opinion, is
simply to wait forever. The purpose of political
leadership in a democratic society is not to follow
public opinion, but to mold it to what is desired.
>Thank you, Dr. Morgenthau.

Shakespeare Play 
Begins Thursday
At Stephen Foster

One hundred and thirty members of the University
community are completing the final stages of preparation
for the Pitt Players’ forthcoming presentation of Measure
for Measure, which opens 8:30 p.m. Thursday at Stephen

Foster Memorial.

_Measure for Measure is “a bit-
ter comedy about the nature of
justice,” according to Dr. Ralph
Allen, assistant professor of
speech and theater arts. He be-
lives that recent enthusiasm for
the play stems from the world
view of humor and pain, as in
some sense identical.

“In terms of personnel invol-
vement, Measure for Measure
will be one of the biggest pro-
ductions the University Theater
has ever attempted,” observed
William Kingsley of the Speech
and Theatre Arts Department.

Apart from the normal duties
performed by costumes, proper-
ties, sound, set construction, busi-
ness, hostess, and front-of-house
crews, the complexity of the
technical facilities demands an
unusually large running crew.

The Pitt Players have moved
their entire multi-channel sound
system to Foster Memorial’s bal-
cony.

The scenery, designed by Phil-
ip Eck, consists of two indepen-
dently moving pie-shaped stair-
cases hinged to a central pivot
point: Motive power for both
units is provided by gang of
shift crew members pushing from
the inside. “Thus, each set piece
appears to move with a mind of
its own. The whole effect is very
bizarre.” explained Kingsley.

 * “Right now,” Kingsley con-

tinued, “our shifters are learn-
mg how to steer their scenery.
At tunes they have difficulty see.

 

In conjunction with the play’s opening day, Dr. Richard
Tobias, assistant professor of English, will lecture on “The
Comic Order in Measure For Measure,” in the University
Book Center at noon, Thursday.

ing out of their peep holes, and
this causes accidents. The other
night one of our actors just miss-
ed being run over by a ﬂight of
stairs. It will take a few more
rehearsals before our set shifters
become safe drivers.”

The incidental music for the
play was written by Colin Sterne,
associate professor of music. It
will be taped by a small orches-
tra especially assembled for the
task. Dr. Sterne will also parti-
cipate in a special program for
secondary schools on November
10 and 11 when the Pitt Players
and the Office of Education Re-
sources will hold an open house
for all high schools in the great-
er Pittsburgh area.

Tickets for Measure for Meas-
ure are on sale - at the student
desks in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, Student Union, Tower lobby,
or at the door before perform-
ances. The price of admission to
members of the University com-
munity is 50 cents. Performances
will run from November 5 to 7
and 9 to 14.
