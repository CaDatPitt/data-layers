Chancellor responds to violence in WPU

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor said
yesterday that a special investigatory com-
mittee will be formed “as soon as possible”
to respond to student and community con-
cerns about the incident on April 1 in which
12 people were arrested and two injured.

“Many of you are aware of the incident
that occurred April 1 at the William Pitt
Union,” O’Connor said.

“The episode is of grave concern to me
and other members of our administration
because it involves the safety and the wel-
fare of our students,” he said.

O’Connor, speaking at the Senate Council

meeting, said Executive Director of Public
Affairs Leon Haley will direct the commit-
tee. O'Connor said at this point he is not
sure whether there will be students on the
committee, but Haley has been in contact
with the National Society of Black
Engineers who were involved in the inci-
dent.

According to O’Connor, the committee
has already begun its inquiry to ensure fair
and just conclusions are reached about the
facts of the case.

He said their recommendations will be
forthcoming and made public, but no
timetable has been set.

O’Connor also announced that Pitt is not
actively considering the Mt. Graham pro-

ject, which was protested last week by a
large student demonstration on the
Cathedral lawn.

“I would just like to clarify: the university
is currently not involved with the project,”
O’Connor said. He said the university is
investigating other projects at this time.

James G. Holland, president of the
Senate, told council members the Benefits
and Welfare Committee is still in the
process of reviewing their report which was
scheduled for presentation at yesterday’s
meeting.

The report, which is an update on the
family medical. and family leave policy rec-
ommendation, will be the subject of “heavy

Rinaldo Washington was inaugurated
as chair of the Black Action Society yes-
terday at a ceremony in Dining Room A
of the William Pitt Union.

Washington, who will now oversee all
BAS activities, said he wanted students to
know they can call on him for help. He
also thanked BAS members for coming
out and supporting him in the March 25
election.

He said his goal as chair will be to get
more students involved with the BAS. In
order to have an impact on campus, he
said the BAS must have student support.

“The backbone of the BAS comes from
students,” Washington said. He said with-
out student support, the BAS would be
powerless.

Linda Perkins, the desk security coordi-
nator in the Housing Department, was the
guest speaker at the inauguration and
told members of the BAS they must con-
tinue nation-building.

According to Perkins, in the ‘60s it was
power to the people, and that generation
recognized the need of building a nation.
However, they also prepared steps for
today’s generation.

In her speech, she compared the BAS
to a laboratory which is looking for a
product. She said the BAS is successful if
it is a place where students can test things
out and learn to be successful themselves.

“We give you a lot to have to carry and

a lot to have to do in the future,” Perkins

Perkins said even though people within

behind closed doors, members must real-
ize they are fighting for the same thing.

refugees
recount

horrors

of war

By Laura Gregory
For The Pitt News

Last night at an educa-
tional forum on the war
in the former Yugoslavia,
Bosnian refugees told
stories of seeing bodies
scattered on the streets of
their neighborhoods,
being cramped in shel-
ters without food or
water for days at a time
and living in constant
fear of death.

The International
Association of Students in
Economics and Business
Management (AIESEC)
sponsored the forum in
David Lawrence Hall as
part of their global—theme
project to stress the
importance of interna-
tional awareness to the
Pitt community.

“Our intentions are to
educate and make peo-
ple aware because it is
unacceptable that not too
many people know
what’s going on in the
former Yugoslavia,” said
Hdeel Abdelhady, the
global project coordina-
tor for the association.
“Part of AIESEC’s mission
is to stress international
awareness.” I

The forum hosted cur-
rent LaRoche College stu-
dents Mina Kovacevio
and Sejla Durachek, both
Balkan refugees, as well
as Dennison Rusinow, a

I Students for Life elect oﬂicers, reflect on accomplishments

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

Stephanie Pritchett, Students
for Life public relations director
during one of the group’s most
successful years, moved up to
president-elect at SFL’s year-end
elections last night.

SFL president Jeff Paladina
presented a long-stemmed rose
to Pritchett, who helped orga-
nize several programs and pub-

' licize SFL events this year.

Pritchett said she already has

plans for SFL in the fall. The

group plans to bring pro-life
supporter Laura Tivis, a former
escort at a third-trimester abor-
tion clinic in Wichita, Kan., to
speak about her experience.

“We are also going to do a
mass mailing project next
semester to every female stu-
dent on campus,” Pritchett said.
“It will be literature on pregnan-
cy help centers and post-abor-
tion trauma centers.”

Besides mailings and speak-
ers, Pritchett said the group will
also continue to support preg-
nancy—help clinics and day—care

facilities like Mom’s House as
well as protesting and marching
in front of abortion clinics.

“We went from two to 150
members this year and we want
to continue on this path of
activism,” Pritchett said, refer-
ring to the success of the past
year

She credited part of the
group’s success as well as her
own success to Paladina’s
efforts this year.

“Jeff taught me everything I
know,” Pritchett said, “and I
hope that God will bless us next

year as he did this year.”

Several SFL members gave a
mahogany—colored briefcase to
Paladina, who is leaving for law
school in the fall.

Ben Garrett, who will be the
group’s treasurer in the fall, told
members how he became
involved in the pro-life move-
merit.

“I went to visit my brother in
[Washington] D.C., and Jeff was
living with him at the time,”
Garrett explained.

J “He took me to a clinic, and I
couldn’t believe what I was see-

ing," he said.

“The women just ﬁled in one
by one by one,” Garrett said,
“and I just kneeled on the
ground crying.”

Paladina also gave a rose to
next year’s public-relations offi-
cer Sophia Kusturis, who is also
the only member left from last
spring. '

“I just hope we can keep on
saving babies,” Kusturis said in
her acceptance speech.

Aiming to turn the Graduate
and Professional Student
Organization into a “resource
center” for students, new presi-
dent Hayley Thompson said she
wants to improve communica-
tion lines between the GPSA
and students.

Graduate school is a very
intense, narrowly focused time
with a lot of stresses placed on
students, according to former
vice-president Thompson. The
role of GPSA is to provide grad-
uate and professional students
with academic, social and finan-
cial support, she said.

Thompson said over the past
few years the services offered
by GPSA have expanded great-
ly, and the resource center is
one of her main goals. _

Along with having the
responsibilities of students,
many graduate and professional
students are also researchers,

V.
 GPSA officers aim to increase communication

teaching assistants and parents,
according to Thompson. “There
needs to be a greater apprecia-
tion of the juggling of roles
graduate students have to do,”
she said.

Thompson said she plans to
focus on providing information
and resources to students, fund-
raising activities that will
address the insufficient support
of graduate student government
and the pursuing of university-
owned and managed graduate
student housing.

Thompson said she is looking
into instituting a monthly semi-
nar program which would dis-
seminate general information to
graduate and professional stu-
dents that they may not now be
getting. Topics will include
things such as financial plan-
ning and budgeting, graduate
student housing and how to use
Intemet and e-mail.

Newly elected vice-president
Patrick Mazur agrees communi-
cation needs to be improved

among graduate students and
their government.

“The biggest problem [for
graduate students] is a lack of
communication. [They] don’t
use the GPSA,” Mazur said. “All
university issues affect all stu-
dents, but there are some issues
graduate and professional stu-
dents have which should be
addressed specifically, such as
graduate student housing.”

GPSA is where graduate and
professional students are able to
express their concerns. These
concerns will be looked into
and addressed, according to
Mazur.

Mazur said he is looking into
the feasibility of Pitt law stu-
dents providing legal advice for
graduate and professional stu-
dents. “[I’m] looking into some
kind of clinical experience,”
Mazur said.

In doing this, law students
would benefit from the hands-
on experience, whereas gradu-
ate and professional students

would also greatly benefit
because they would have
access to free legal advice.

David Sidore, a retuming ofﬁ—
cer, said, he is looking to contin-
ue to work on the previous pro-
jects that GPSA has initiated. -In
his second year as business
manager, Sidore said he wants
to make sure “the things that we
set up continue to grow and are
seen through.”

According to Sidore, GPSA
has grown considerably in the
last few years.

In the last year, the GPSA has
dealt with such problems as the
shuttle system, security lighting,
a proposed book scholarship,
an added legal service and trav-
el grants of up to $100 for stu-
dents who want to travel to
conferences.

Sidore also pointed out that
this was the first year that the
Advocate shifted from a
newsletter to a newspaper.

Focus
finishes
year with
awards
ceremony

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

Honoring the dedication
and effort put forth by stu-
dents, faculty and staff, the
Focus program ended the
school year yesterday with
a reception and an awards
ceremony in the Masonic
Temple.

The program, which
was created in August of
last year, was formed to
provide academic support
for African—American and
Hispanic first-year stu-
dents.

“The reason we look at
African-American and
Hispanic students is
because of the low reten-
tion rate of those students
at graduation. There are
things you can do inside
as well as outside the
classroom to foster
growth,” Director of New
Student Programs Brenda
Pardini said.

According to Pardini,
Focus offers-special ser-
vices for incoming African-
American and Hispanic
first—year students. The
program provides leaders,
who are upperclass or
graduate students, men-
tors, who are faculty mem-
bers, and sets up meetings
for the groups. Each group

- of 10 incoming students is
assigned two leaders and
one mentor. “A personal-
ized approach is very
effective. We give the
groups ideas to talk about
in meetings. But it’s not all
educational. There. is food,
fun and friendship,”
Pardini said.

Also involved in Focus
is Nancy Washington,
assistant to the chancellor.
“First—year students are
very precious to us. That’s
why we are offering cer-
tificates and awards,” she
said.

at Pitt who detailed the horrors
and emotions endured during
the war.

Kovacevio and Durachek told
of how their closest friends
were raped by soldiers, taken
to concentration camps or
killed.

They explained the frustra-
tion of not knowing if family
members were dead or alive.

They also recalled the horror
of realizing people who were

Yugoslavia and no one is doing
anything about it.

“There is no sense in giving
food to people who may be
killed tomorrow. You’ve got to
stop the killing,” Kovacevio
said as she asked the audience
to write to their senators and
encourage the U.S. government
to do more.

“[l’m] sick and tired of read-
ing and hearing from leaders,
like Clinton, that this is all

99

dictators from doing what they
really wanted to do.”

Rusinow went on to say that
in the history of Eastern
Europe, there have been more
instances of cooperation than
hostility and the destruction of
a multicultural functioning soci-
ety was all in the name of a
right to a state.

Sophomore Nate Sears said
he attended the forum because
he wanted to know what was

really going on in Bosnia
because of possible U.S. mili-
tary involvement.

He said the information corn-
ing from the media is very
biased.

“The students’ testimony was
powerful. I hope it says some-
thing to encourage students in
Pittsburgh to become active in
the issue,” Pitt student Jennifer
Nagel said. “Our apathy is not
innocent.”

AIESEC member Jessica
Bozza said hearing about an
issue first hand has a big effect
on one’s opinion.

“It’s very important that stu-
dents gain an understanding of
what’s going on in Bosnia.”
Bozza said.

“So many things are unheard
of, like the rapes of women,
that when you hear the stories
first hand it makes you see it’s
realistic.”

were uncontested. Voting num-
bers were in the 405 versus the
470 voters for this election. I’d
like to think that this reﬂects a
greater interest [on the part of
the graduate studentsl,” he said.

Sidore is not alone in his pos-
itive outlook on the recent elec-
tions. Outgoing president Steve
Parks said he considers the
large turnout for the elections a
great success.

“The best thing is we had
contested elections and quali-
fied candidates.  We now
have officers committed to
keeping up what's been going
on and expanding into issues

such as community service and
financial aid. I think it will be a
better organization than it has
been,” Parks said.

But Parks is leaving his two-
year stint as president of GPSA
with some final advice. Parks
said he has heard numerous
complaints from women on
campus who said they have
been mistreated and the univer-
sity is lacking in services to aid
women. “This year the GPSA
should devote themselves to
getting a women’s center on
campus.  That’s the next thing
that has to be done.”

Airstrikes were overdue

On Sunday, two U.S. fighter planes bombed Serbian
targets —-— the first NATO attack on ground positions in
its history —— near Gorazde, a Muslim area in Bosnia,
according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. They did this
at the request of United Nations’ peacekeepers sta-
tioned in the town. As opposed to allowing the situa-
tion to deteriorate further, the United Nations is finally
making use of NATO forces to enhance its operations.
Gorazde was designated by the United Nations as one
of the six “safe areas” for Muslims in Bosnia (Post-
Gazette).

This situation cannot be allowed to be resolved by
those involved, and it is long past time for the United
Nations, and the United States, to act to end the atroci-
ties. The war has been one-sided until now because of
the arms embargo, and if things are allowed to
progress as they have gone, ethnic cleansing and
wholesale slaughter will continue. At an educational
forum sponsored by the International Association of
Students in Economics and Business Management last
night, two students from Bosnia shared their experi-
ences of the war. Mina Kovacevic and Sejla Durachek,
both of whom now attend LaRoche College in
Pittsburgh, related how they lost friends and family in
the fighting and faced persecution solely because they
were Muslims. Sejla Durachek related how 50 years
ago, her grandfather was in a Nazi concentration
camp, and how recently her father was placed in a
Serbian concentration camp. Although the world swore
to never let it happen again, genocide is rearing its
ugly head. Dennison Rusinow from the University
Center for International Studies spoke on the history of
Yugoslavia and how the reports of centuries,-old hatred
are overstated. According to Rusinow, Yugoslavia was
“fragile,” but it was as stable as other multicultural
societies. When the economic situation took a dramatic

downturn, the “us against them” formula was exploited .

by politicians to lay blame on ethnic groups. In addi-
tion, Rusinow spoke on how the communists promot-
ed the brotherhood of Yugoslavia, and that when com-
munism was rejected, “They threw out the baby with
the bath water,” and associated this brotherhood move-
ment with the evils of communism. '

Mina Kovacevic posed the question of what good is
it to bring relief supplies to besieged people if they are
just going‘ to be killed by bombs the next day. She also
made the important point that those who stand by and
watch the atrocities take place are as guilty as those
who take part. The bombings are a positive step
because they show that the United Nations, NATO and
the United States will no longer stand idly by and
watch. It is past time that an active role is to be taken
by the world to put an end to the madness.

Hebron massacre.

He was one of many Jewish
leaders (like Prime Minister
Shimon Peres) to come forth
with an apology. Seems like a
nice thing to do, but why?

Since when is a rabbi in
Pittsburgh or a leader of a gov-
ernment responsible for the act
of one individual? ‘

They are not responsible for

. the massacre, and by apologiz-

ing they accomplish nothing.

Did the American govern-
ment apologize to the families
of Jeffrey Dahmer’s victims? .

Did any Arab government
apologize for the terrorists who
bombed the World Trade
Center?

Did Yasser Arafat, or any
other Arab leader, apologize
for the killings of the Israeli
athletes at the Munich
Olympics in 1972?

Finally, did anyone on Pitt’s
campus apologize for allowing
Professor Leonard Jeffries, a
blatant anti-Semite, to speak on
campus?

The answer to all these ques-
tions is: absolutely not.

The Hebron massacre was a
terrible tragedy.

However, Jewish leaders
should not be wasting their

The new gun ban that has been proposed to
the Pennsylvania state legislature is an outright
attack against the rights of gun owners of
Pennsylvania. This ban, if passed, would outlaw

47 different types of guns.

- The promoters of this ban keep parading guns
like the MAC-11 and the TEC-9 in front of us
which, I will concede, have no real value to
sportsmen or for self-defense but do look evil
and help gain popular support for the ban.

What they don’t like to make public is that this
ban also includes guns like .22 caliber pistols
which are often the gun of choice for target
shooting since the ammunition is very inexpen-

sive compared to others.

breath by apologizing for
something that is not their
responsibility.

Another issue stemming from
the Hebron massacre is the
involvement of the United
Nations.

First of all, the UN Security
Council, of which Israel is the
only country in the world
denied membership (Wall
Street journal, March 24),
recently passed a resolution

condemning Baruch Goldstein, ’
the Hebron gunman, and basi-5

cally bashing Israel.

Why is it necessary to lump
the actions of one man with an
entire government, and why is

this only done with Israel?

I must have been out to
lunch when the United Nations
passed a resolution condemn-
ing the United States govern-
ment and Colin Ferguson for
shooting up a Long Island
Railroad train last December.

Besides, since when does the
UN condemn the actions of
individuals? It doesn’t, and it
never has.

inception in 1948.

For example, there is the res-
olution it passed in 1985 con-
demning the Israeli military for
bombing and destroying an
Iraqi nuclear weapons plant.
The UN should not have con-
demned Israel.

Instead, it should have been

In addition, Israel showed

early days of the Gulf War by
not retaliating against Iraq /after
the bombing of Israeli towns.

United States easily and quickly

It’s bad enough the UN and

Pitt crew
Wins gold

in Jersey

By Jiln Clark
Staﬂ Writer

Pitt’s crew team won
one gold medal this past
weekend at the LaSalle
Invitational in Camden,
NJ.

“It was a good day,”
women’s coach Jon
Dougherty 'said. “We
weren’t disappointed.”

The women’s novice
four, whose crew consists
of Kathy Bebout, Keri
Killnger, Sue Land, Kiera
Kociban and Coxswain
Tammy Sabbagh, placed
first.

“I was really happy
with the women’s novice
four,” Dougherty said.

Dougherty said he was
pleased with the entire
team’s showing, even
though they didn’t have
much time to practice
because of the high water
level of the river,

“Everything went real
well,” he said. “The prob-
lems__we had were from
condiflaohingj” ” 

Dougherty said the
team did well early on in
the meet, but it seemed to
tire as the meet went on.
Still, he said that the meet
“was a good learning
experience.”

\X/omen’s captain Leah
Byers said she thought
Pitt’s teams performed
well against the competi-

tion, which included
Delaware, LaSalle,
Bucknell, Villanova,

Susquehanna and Drexel.
“Overall, both teams
really improved and did
real well this weekend,”
Byers said. “These will be
a lot of the schools we’ll
be racing against at Dad
Vail [the May 13-14 east-
ern championships in
Philadelphial.”

Byers, along with team-
mates Janinne Markizon,
Amy Dzien, Hillary
\X/entz, Maureen
McGuigan, Kociban,
Land, Bebout and
coxswain Crissie Cote,
finished third in the
women’s lightweight
eight.

The men’s heavyweight
four and its crew of Matt
Prechtel, James Connolly,
David Hamburger, John
Whiteford and coxswain
Stu Chase placed second
at the meet, while the
men’s heavyweight eight
and lightweight four both
finished fifth.

Throughout the 1994 season
and much of the last two years,
baseball at Pitt has been syn-
onymous with offense. The Pitt
baseball team’s run-and-gun

attack has been the spark to ~

light their growing inferno.

But what has kept them from
taking their first dip in the play-
off waters is the same thing that
haunts countless offensive pow-
erhouses at every level of ama-
teur and pro baseball — a shaky
pitching staff.

It can be likened to a fear-
some, heavily armed warship
made of paper mache.

However, as their pitching
staff has matured, the Panthers
are slowly but surely starting to
take on the look of a serious
championship contender.

The Pitt hurlers notched
another strong performance on
a chilly Monday morn, as they
minimized the damage caused
by 12 Villanova hits, allowing
just three baserunners to score,
while stranding 10 in a 10-3
Panther victory over the
Wildcats.

The victory in the blistering
cold at Trees Field yesterday put
the wraps on the Panthers’ third
consecutive Big East three—game

‘ sweep to start off the confer.-

ence season. They tallied victo-
ries of 3-2 and 20-7 in a
Saturday doubleheader.

Crawley breaks mold of prototype fist basema

By Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

Tradition calls for size and
power in a first baseman — two
things that Pitt starter Craig
Crawley doesn’t have.

Out of the 28 starting first
baseman in Major League
Baseball last year, the average
height was 6-feet-2—inches tall.

And out of those starting first
basemen, 22 of them had at
least 15 or more home runs, and
24 of them hit in the middle of
the lineup.

Despite the odds, Pitt head
coach Mark Jackson converted
S-8 Craig Crawley to first base
this year.

“It’s nice to have a 6-5 first
baseman, but there’s not too
many of them around,” Jackson
said.

“Craig’s a good athlete, and
does a real good job over
there.

“He’s played the infield
before, so he can make the
adjustment easily.”

At Millford Mill High School
in Baltimore, Crawley was
recruited to play second base.

But during his first year at Pitt,
he suffered a bad arm injury
which required surgery. He had

ence games remaining for each

Tyler Shantz (1-4, 5 RBI),

1 RBI) lead the Panther offense,

and when he came back his arm

should. -

But Crawley persevered.

“It’s really a credit for him to
play because he’s been through
a lot,” Jackson said.

“That’s been an inspiration for
the guys because he’s worked

hard and now he’s
playing.”
Crawley’s perseverance

wasn’t enough to move icon
four—year starting second base-
man Brad Reese, so Crawley
moved to left field where he
was a regular last season. He hit
a steady .286 and led the team
in stolen bases with 20.

Finally as a senior, Crawley’s

Now Craig has to deal with

day’s practice, it seems that
everyone, from the quarter-
backs to the coaches to even
the guy who runs out to grab
the tee after kickoffs made
some sort of progress. The lev-
els of progress vary, but you
can bet your bottom dollar that
everyone makes some type of it.

Sample.

Majors on the quarterhacle sit-
nation.-

“John Ryan has made much
progress, and he’s our No. 1
quarterback right now. The
other two have made progress
in their execution.”

Majors on the receiving corps.-

“The receiving corps has
made good progress —— it’s defi-
nitely improved over last season
at this time.”

Majors on the overall aspect
of the team.-

“\X/e’ve made progress as far
as knowing what we expect and

knowing what to do about the

system.”

Fine, progress. But progress
toward what?

“He basically wants progress
to perfection,” redshirt sopho-
more wideout Curtis Anderson
said. “That’s a hard goal to
reach, but that’s what we’re
working toward.”

“Were trying to improve on
the way we played last year —
trying to get a little more disci-
plined, trying to cut down on
the penalties,” senior tackle
Reuben Brown said. “\Ve’ve got
a new attitude because we’re
tired of losing. \X/e’re tired of
people making jokes about the
Pitt football team.

“I have people talking to me
all the time saying ‘Aw, you
guys suck, you’re losers.’ We
want to change that. Even if we
don’t go to a bowl game, we
want to go out with a winning
season so people can’t say that
we’re losers.”

Brown, an Outland Trophy
and All-American candidate,
will have much, but not all, to
do with the desired transforma-
tion this season. One of the
biggest question marks that cur—
rently circulates around Pitt
Stadium is who he will be pass
blocking for when they kick it
off against Texas on Sept. 3.

think ‘Oh, Craig’s short, I better
throw the ball lOw.’”

For not having that much
experience at first, Crawley has
surpassed all expectations.

SO far he is flawless in the
field, and because of his low
center of gravity that many taller
first basemen don’t have, he is
able to scoop out a lot of bad
throws.

“When I played second base I
had to scoop balls, so it’s no big
deal,” Crawley said.

“He’s got great hands,” short-
stop Danny Gonzalez said.
“Balls in the dirt, he’s better
than anybody else.

“He does a great job. The
coaches taught him to use the
bag to get some extra inches, so
it’s no big deal.”

Crawley’s size at first base is
“no big deal” to his teammates,
but his bat is something oppos-
ing pitchers can’t avoid.

As a leadoff hitter, he does his
job better than anybody. He
leads the team with an astound-
ing .577 on-base percentage
and .431 batting average.

And when he gets on, he
scores. With only 51 at-bats he
has scored 27 times, which
means he scores 53 percent of
the time.

Believe it or not, Crawley has
even better numbers in Big East
play. He’s hitting .538 and has
an on-base percentage of .629.

“He’s a good leadoff hitter,”
Jackson said.

“He’s got a high on-base per-
centage, so he’s done a good
job in that role. He takes a lot of
pitches and bunts well, which
are things leadoff men have to
do.

“He’s a good contact hitter
and a good overall hitter.
Overall, he’s doing a real nice
job offensively.”

‘Jackson admits that it is very
unusual for a first baseman to
bat leadoff — so unusual that
not one first baseman in the
majors bats leadoff.

Usually first basemen are
known for their power and their
RBI capabilities — and are rela-
tively slow.

But not Crawley.

Out of his 22 hits, only two
are for extra bases.

But when he hits a single, Or
walks — which he leads the
team in -- it ultimately turns
into a triple because of his
extraordinary speed.

Crawley’s 19 stolen bases on

‘20 attempts head Pitt’s potent

offensive attack.

Just ask the Villanova
Wildcats, who Pitt played last
weekend, about Crawley and
the havoc he creates.

In the second game of the
tripleheader, when Pitt scored
20 runs, he went 4-for-5 with
three runs scored, three RBI and
six stolen bases.

Six stolen bases is a career
total for tnost first basemen.

But then again, Crawley isn’t
like most first basemen.
