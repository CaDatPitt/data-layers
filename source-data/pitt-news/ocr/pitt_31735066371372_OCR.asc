,tProvost calls for 25%
budget cut over 5 years

Pitt Senior Vice Chancellor and Provost
Roger Benjamin delivered his report on aca-
demic planning priorities at yesterday's
meeting of the University Senate. His plan
calls for a 25 percent budget cut over the
next five years, are-evaluation of university-
wide priorities and a reallocation of existing
resources.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar described the
plan as a challenge to “discover creative
ways to do it better with the same or fewer
resources."

The first phase of the process involves an
assessment of academic priorities within
each department. This assessment will be
carried out by the department as an exercise
in self-review. Each department is expected
to produce a “planning document“ which
would outline departmental mission, goals
and objectives.

The planning document would also divide
and identify academic programs into four
categories: those that need increased sup-
port, those that require the same support,
those that should receive reduced support
and/ or be merged with othersimilar pro-

grams, and those which are to be phased out.
According to Benjamin, all financial assess-
ments must take into account the proposed
25 percent budget reduction. Faculty input
into this reorganization will be required.

Once the departmental reviews are com-
pleted they will be turned over to Benjamin
who, with the advice of the Faculty Task
Force on Planning, the University Senate
committees, the University Planning Advi-
sory Council and the Office of Planning and
Budget, will devise a preliminary overall
academic development plan for the
university. »

Representatives from various university
departments expressed concern over the
proposed budget cuts. Professor of social
work James Cunningham questioned what
he termed the “pessimistic tone" of Benja-
min’s report, which he said was filled with
allusions to ending growth and declining
resources. Cunningham said that statistics.
showing increases in'university enrollment
and a reduced rate of inflation argue for less
drastic measures than those proposed by
Benjamin.

“l‘d choose the word realsim and not pess-
imism." Benjamin said, adding “I did not
come to the University of Pittsburgh merely
to trim budgets."

Posvar said that Benjamin’s report is
“meant to lead to beneficial results“ by caus-

ing both faculty and administration to face
up to the limited resources ofthe university.

Posvar defended the new budget designs‘

as necessary in order to adapt the university
to changing economic conditions.

“We have tended to take our way ofdoing
business for granted,“ he said. *

He went on to say that for Pitt to expand
in the coming years it must modernize its
spending policy.

“The growth of the ‘S05, '60s and early ’70s

was a period of unreality...a dream world,"
Posvar said.

Plans to change or cut out programs won't
officially begin until January I985. How-
ever, certain department heads fear that
highly technical skills and those majors that
lead to lucrative professions will take prece-
dence over many of the humanities and arts.

Other business discussed at the senate‘s
last meeting of theterm included Posvar's
recent Harrisburg meeting with the Secra-
tary of Education. The trip included a report
from the Governor's
Finance in Higher Education, which is.
headed by Pitt trustee Robert Kirby.

The Caliguiri administration
has asked Pitt’s graduate school
of Public and International
Affairs for help in preparingthe
city's I984 report on the impact
of military spending on
Pittsburgh.

City Treasurer Steven Schillo
said he had contacted the univer-
sity in an interview ‘after a public
‘ hearing yesterday.

“We sent a letter to GSPIA
asking whether some faculty out
there would be willing to work
on the I984 report," Schillo said.

Schillo revealed that he had
contacted Pitt after a City Coun-
cil hearing during which more
than two dozen speakers
attacked the administration for
its military spending report
released in December of 1983.

That report, first ever for the
city, was an analysis of how
many local tax dollars paid to the
federal government are returned

to the city through defense
contracts. -
According to the report, which
covers the year ending in
December of I982, four times as
many dollars were returned to
the city through defense con-

tracts than were paid in federal.

income taxes.

The report was based on
“faulty data and reasoning,“
according to three Pitt profes-
sors who spoke in favor of setting
up an advisory committee to
more thoroughly analyze the
data used to arrive at the city's
conclusions.

Pitt economics professor
David Houston calculated that
Pittsburgh taxpayers paid far
more to the federal government
than the city received in defense
dollars. ,

He said each taxpayer suffered
a net loss of $410 in 1982. That
works out to a net loss of l73.8
million to the city.

Houston, Robert Norman and
Jim Cunningham, all members
of Pitt’s faculty, reserved some of

The Student Government Board
indicated at last night‘s meeting that
it would not support any ofthe three
resolutions proposed Tuesday by
the Governmental Relations
Committee. .

No formal voting by the board
was taken on Government Relation
Committtee pro- posals because
none of the necessary documenta-
tion was complete.

In response to the committee's
motion_ to withdraw Governor
Thornburgh‘s invitation to speak at
Pitt’s I984 commencement exer-
cises, SGB president Ken Stram
said, “The governor is a powerful
supporter of higher education and
has done an enormous amount to
give Pitt a 2 percentincrease of state
funding."

Stram continued. “He,[Thorn-
burgh] is in support of the Ben
Franklin Partnership, which will
finance research and give Pitt $l0
million in matching funds.”

Thornburgh‘s proposed I984-85
budget, currently before the state
legislature, calls for a $l0 million
increase in funding to the four cen-
ters which comprise the Ben Frank-
lin Partnership.

Stram also said, “The governor is

also very supportive of the PHEAA
(Pennsylvania Higher Education
Association) program. For the Stu-
dent Government to ignore these
facts and support a resolution which
would ask him not to speak at Pitt's
graduation would be silly and
embarassing.“

Government Relations Chairman
John Leopold said, “Having Gover-
nor Thornburgh speak is like a slap
in the face to what the [committee]
and the Pitt lobbying group does [in
Harrisburg].“

Leopold told the board that he
and the rest of his committee believe
their proposal will never make it to
Chancellor Wesley Posvar‘s office
but that the recommendation was
still in the best interest of the
students.

increase in funding instead ofthe l6
percent requested, that tuition will
be increased by approximately l4
percent. But citing a point of infor-
mation, Stram said that the increase
is estimated at 5-l0 percent. ’

A second resolution by the com-
mittee, that all information concern-
ing cable television be released to

Student Government, was formally *

announced to the board.

Board member Avery Abrams
said that he wrote a letter to asso-
ciate provost Raymond Steele,
whom Abrams said formerly sup-
ported all efforts to get cable televi-
sion installed in the William Pitt
Union by the end of this semester.

Steele has yet to reply to'Abrams'
letter, saying that cable television
was not a matter for Student
Government.

The Government Relations Com-
mittee’s request that the administra-
tion disclose all of its holdings in
South Africa in wake of the recent
controversy over a stop there by the
Semester at Sea program was also
announced to the full board.

Stram said, “Vice Chancellor-
Jack Freeman will be more than
happy to release" a list of holdings to
the board, so this demand is not
necessary.”

bed. His lecture was videotaped and played for
students, giving a whole new dimension to
education.

Cancer breakthroughs seen

By Tim Hunter
The Pitt News

Cancer research specialists dis-
closed their latest findings before an
overflow crowd yesterday at a Pitt
symposium held in Western Psychi-
atric Institute auditorium.

An estimated I50 people who
could not find seats in Western
Psych’s auditorium watched the
symposium on television monitors
in two separate rooms. “The over-
flow is indicative of the high caliber
of speakers," said Pitt biology pro-
fessor James Pipas.

Dr. J. Michael Bishop, researcher
and director of the Hooper Founda-
tion at the University of California
at San Fransico, gave evidence that
tumor viruses acquire their tumori-
genic potential by incorporating cel-
lular genes, called proto-oncogenes,
inside their structure. Bishop
believes that this incorporation
leads to the activationiand expres-
sion of cellular oncogenes. Onco-
genes are DNA segments that cause
cancer when they are introduced
into a cell.

Bishop maintained that onco-
genes might be carcinogenic because
of the damage they cause when they
invade the genetic material of nor-
mal cells. He said he is trying to
understand the purpose of proto-
oncogenes.

“This is not an easy field to

explore. We hope to find out [more]
through studying the fruit fly, which
possesses proto-oncogenes. In six
months, we’ll know the effects of
depriving this fly of these genes,”
said Bishop. “What is true for fruit
flies is true for homo sapiens.”

- The other symposium speakers,
Dr. Robert A. Weinberg and Dr.
George Khoury, are natives of the
Pittsburgh area, and even attended
the same elementary school, Linden,
which they visited before the sympo-
sium. They were escorted there by
the teachers who first taught them
math and science.

Weinberg is now associated with
the Center for Cancer Research and
the Whitehead Institute for Biomed-
ical Research in addition to his post
as professor of biology at the Massa-
cusetts Institute of Technology.
Khoury is Chief of the Laboratory
of Molecular Virology of the

National Cancer Institute.

Weinberg was the first to isolate
the cellular oncogene and show its
relation in the tumorigenic potential
of many clinical cancers. He is stud-
ying the molecular mechanisms of
oncogenesis.

“We feel that the large number of
different types of tumors are derived
from a small number of mecha-
nisms," Weinberg said. He believes
these mechanisms are related to two
types of oncogenes, RAS and MYT.

“There are implications that more
than onetype of oncogene is neces-
sary for tumorgenesis,“ Weinberg
explained. “RAS and MYT onco-
genes, working together, could pro-
duce cancerous tumors." RAS
incorporates itself into the cyto-
plasm of a normal cell and changes
the cell‘s shape; MYT incorporates
itself into the nucleus of the cell and
“immortalizes” it so it will have con-
tinuous growth. “This suggests there
are two critical targets for oncogenes
on the cell, one in the nucleus and
one in the cytoplasm."

Khoury works as a pioneer in new
technologies for obtaining “maps,”
or the sequence orders, of how
tumor viruses incorporate them-
selves in the nucleus of normal cells.

“We have found that there are
enhancer sequences in the viruses
which tell them how and in which
way they should regulate other
cells.”

Four Pitt students were among
ll7 Pennsylvanians named yester-
day as delegates pledged to support
U.S. Senator Gary Hart at the
Democratic National Convention in
July.

Pitt seniors Bill Davis and Jaclyn
Fink of the 14th Congressional Dis-
trict, Mindy Goldberg of the l8‘th
Congressional District and junior
Leslie Messineo of the 20th Con-
gressional District will run as Hart
delegates in the state's April 10 pri-
mary election.

At a Pittsburgh news conference
yesterday, Tom Hoog, who was
recently named as Hart's campaign
manager for Pennsylvania, noted
that the Pennsylvania and New
York primaries are “very important"
to the success of the Hart campaign.
“We want to show momentum,"
Hoog said. “We need to show our
ability to draw votes from all sec-
tions of the country."

Hoog said Hart's Pennsylvania

campaign will follow the “same stra-
tegy that would have been put in
place a year ago.“ He said, “It is our
job to run our campaign...and not
take steps to force a reaction from
Mondale [former Vice President].

The Hart campaign yesterday
issued a press statement quoting
Western Pennsylvania campaign
director Bruce Ledewitz as follows:

to field a full slate ofdelegates, in the

last month, we have received the
endorsements of more than enough
delegate candidates to fill our slates.
We have received firm, signed
pledges from delegates previously
aligned with Governor Askew,
Senator Cranston and Senator
Glenn.

Ledewitz acknowledged that it
will be difficult for the Hart cam-
paign to persuade voters to choose
delegates who appear to be pledged
to another candidate. Because sev-
eral of the original Democratic can-
didates have withdrawn from the
race, Hart's campaign has picked up
some additional, and unexpected,
backing in the last month.

JOHN G. ADAMS, author ofWith-
out Precedent, a memoir of the
McCarthy era, and counsellor

Ledewitz went on to explain in the
statement that Western Pennsylva-
nia historically has been a crucially
important area for “non-
establishment Democrats.“

Pennsylvania has a two-step
primary system in which voters first
indicate their presidential choices,
then vote for the delegates who will
actually attend the Democratic
National Convention in San
Francisco. \

attendance, but has been met with the same absenteeism. These
representatives are elected by the student body and have the
power to submit and vote on legislation.

If all 69 student representatives showed up, they could effec-
tively control the organization. Tobias joked after the meeting
that he would love to see the students show up and “pass some
wild legislation like closing down the university." Yesterday
was the last senate meeting of this semester; however, summer
meetings are scheduled.

By not attending these crucial meetings, these elected repre-
sentatives have failed to fulfill the obligations of their offices. If
they wish to put their positions on their transcripts, then they
sure as hell ought to do what they were empowered to do ——
speak for the nearly 30,000 Pitt students. It is a betrayal of the
trust bestowed upon them. If they can’t do theirjobs, then they
should resign.

I don‘t think so. My girlfriend is

no idea what causes this disease, but
he is in luck; I have a plan to cure it.

First, he must be fired from his
teachingjob so that he cannot infect
his students. Then, he must be

can be watched and drugged. If he
shows any signs of paranoia or
depression, that will confirm my

that Christians aren't sinless, but
through the substitutionary death of
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
we can regain the fellowship with
our Father as He initially intended.
Again Mr. Schneidmiller, Chris-

Bless God.

It is in the First Amendment to the
Constitution that we are guaranteed
that no religious group in the United
States will be denied freedom of
worship or access to it. This country
also chose, in drafting the First
Amendment, to insulate the govern-
ment from religious institutions,
drawing up a careful boundary
separating the two. This separation
of church and state is threatening to
narrow.

Last week, the Supreme Court
ruled by a slim margin of 5-4 to
allow government funds to be used
in the setting up of a Pawtucket,

The court, in making its decision,
was not to decide the historical
prominence nor the validity of the
scene. It was to make clear whether
or not church and state had bridged
their prescribed separation. Writing
for the majority opinion, Chief Jus-
tice Warren Burger said, “It engend-
ers a friendly community spirit of
good will...at the very time people
are taking note of the season with
Christmas hymns and carols in pub-
lic schools and other public

Good for spirit, good for business,

The Christ Child in the manger
with its obligatory cross is not an
innocuous symbol, but a very mean-
ingful one, one unmistakenly under-
stood in America. lt is, after all, the
symbol of Christianity. Government
funding supporting such a symbol
denotes the state’s support of that
religion above others.

The decision inevitably forecasts

Prof lectures from hospital bed

By Jennifer Benzing
The Pitt News

Dr. Van Beck Hall made Pitt
history on Monday from his bed
in Presbyterian Hospital.

Laid up with hisarm in trac-
tion, Hall refused to take a break
from teaching. For the first time
in Pitt's history, Pitt students
watched their professor lecture
from a hospital bed.

Suprisingly enough, the stu-
dents in his Civil War history
class remained attentive, despite
their missing professor.

Nobody slept or left early, and
attendance was average. How-
ever, when asked if they would
prefer this type of teaching
(through videotapes) to the tra-
ditional mode, the students’ reac-
tions were mixed.

Hall’s experiment raises the
question of whether instruction
via videotape would be as enjoy-
able or as effective as the tradi-
tional mode. Although the taped
lecture was well received, most
students believed that if this type
of teaching were to replace usual
methods, the quality of teaching
and learning would suffer.

The main objection was that
questions and discussion would
be impossible. Also, interest and
attendance would decline if the

professor were not physically

present in the classroom. As one
student pointed out, however,
videotapes of actual lectures
would be of great value if pro-
vided as a supplement to the lee-
ture itself.

Hall agreed with the general
opinion that videotaped lectures

do lack the appeal of traditional
presentations. He thinks the tap-
ing was, in fact, a “gap ﬁller" or
emergency measure to alleviate

   

an unusual problem. He believes
that if viewed as an alternative to
the traditional mode, videotaped
lectures would lack the necessary

rapport and feedback.
1680 back.

Although the general attitude
of his stude_n_ts toward the lee-
ture was positive, its success may
be attributable to Hall's
charisma.

Jim Benz, a media specialist
for the university, taped the lec-
ture. Normally, his work
includes videotaping operations,
lab and clinical procedures for
the medical and dental schools,
so taping a professor in a hospi-
tal bed was a bit unusual.

 Pitt    .

The problems in the taping
were not limited to the physical
constraints ofthe hospital room.
Difficulties were encountered in
the transportation and setting up
of the equipment in a classroom
not designed for the purpose of
video presentations.

To avoid these problems in the
future, proposals have been
made to wire and equip every
classroom for video transmis-
sion, according to the universi-
ty‘s Media Services.

Kathy Matesic, of the Univer-
sity Center for Instructional
Resources, said that rooms are
currently being studied to assess
their transmission needs.

Two American sailboats and I7 crewmen were seized yester-

Captain David Rodgers, the skipper of the U.S. aircraft

Rodgers said the Soviet sub was operating without naviga-
tion lights in the dark when it struck the Kitty Hawk, an
80,000-ton vessel with 5,000 crew members. Although the car-
rier suffered no damages and no injuries were reported, one
CBS station said the carrier is now lying “dead in the water,"
guarded by another Soviet vessel.

their harshest criticism for the city’s
apparent failure to monitor West-
inghouse Electric Corp., the city’s
largest defense contractor.

Westinghouse received defense
contracts totalling $558.l million in
l982, but. according to Westing-
house spokesman Tom Duncan, 99
percent of the company’s defense
business is in Baltimore.

Even though Westinghouse,
which is headquartered in Pitts-
burgh, received large sums from the
Pentagon, the bulk of that money
was spent elsewhere, Duncan said.

“A few administrative types push
paper around here, but nowhere
near $558 million is spent [here],”
Duncan told The Pitt News in Feb-
ruary.

The city’s report does not ade-
quately reﬂect the defense dollars
actually spent in Pittsburgh, Hous-
ton said.

“It would take two minutes to
change that inaccuracy," said
Norman.

The Pitt professors recommended
to the City Council that the advisory
committee be composed of labor,
business, academic and citizen
representatives who would recom-
mend more effective research
methods to the mayor.

Schillo said the advisory commit-
tee was a good idea.

The Pitt News

Pitt students are “lifting” the
V hopes of mentally and physically
handicapped children.

Approximately 50 to 75 stu-
dents bench pressed or did sit ups
to participate in Pitt's first Lift-
A-Thon to raise money for the
Special Olympics and “the
National Strength and Condi-
tioning Association's scientific
research to develop athletic
performance.

Participants gathered spon-
sors who pledged a minimum of
one cent per sit up completed in a
three-minute time period or
pounds that were bench pressed.

The Lift-A-Thon, which
began on Monday, was headed
by Warren Sipp and weight
training instructor Marc Olivo.

Sipp, who is the strengthening
and conditioning coach, ‘has
been involved with the handi-
capped for l4 years. He became
involved with the Lift-A-Thon
because he believed it was a way
of “melting the two together."

Students lift for kids

Olivo has been a member of

By Bernadette Hartman the National Strength and Con-

ditioning Association for three
years. He became involved in the
Lift-A—Thon because he said he
felt it would be a good chance to
let the people who exercise do it
for others instead of themselves.

Bryan Boak and Joann Sloan
were two students who partici-
pated in the Lift-A-Thon.

Boak, who has worked in the
Special Olympics in Michigan,
benched 330 pounds and raised
approximately $l40.00. “The
Lift-A-Thon gave me a sense of
personal pride," he said.

Joann Sloan completed 80 sit
ups in the three-minute time
period, raising approximately
$50.00.

Anyone can participate, Sipp
said. “You don’t have to be
strong. If you can't lift a lot, get
more pledges.“

All students who participated
in the Lift-A-Thon will receive
an official Lift America award
certificate. High achievers will
receive additional awards based
on the total amount of pledges
they received. These awards
include T-shirts, gym bags, a
jacket or a warm-up suit.

Cancer center gears up for fall

By Nancy Popkin
The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Cancerlnstitute, a
cooperative effort between Pitt,
Carnegie-Mellon University and the
University HealthiCenter hospitals,
will begin research in the fall. The
number of patients served will
depend entirely on demand, accord-
ing to Pitt medical school dean Dr.
Donald Leon.

The institute is the first of its kind
in Western Pennsylvania. The uni-
versities will also conduct research
in genetics, basic biology, microbiol-
ogy and cancer epidemiology, and
the information acquired will be
applied to cancer treatment and
research in the six hospitals.

The present health center, with its
2,800 beds, will be able tocare for in-
patients, but Leon said he doubts
there will be such a large demand for
hospital care. About l,O00 people
could be cared for as outpatients, he
said.

The institute does not have a
headquarters; however, all adult
patients will be screened at Falk
Clinic, which is being remodeled and
expanded for that purpose. Chil-
dren‘s Hospital will serve younger
patients.

The idea for a cancer center has
been talked about at Pitt since the
early 19705, Dr. Thomas Detre,
Pitt's associate senior vice chancel-
lor for the health sciences, said.

Cancer is the second-highest
cause of death in the United States,
and Pennsylvania is the third highest
cancer region in the country —
behind New York and California —
according to statistics from the
American Cancer Society.

The increase in cases of cancer
and a need for a Western Pennsylva-
nia cancer center stem from suc-

cesses in other areas of medicine that
have made the average life span
longer, Detre explained.

We live longer because we do not
die of infections, and cardiovascular
disorders are decreasing. The result,
Detre said, is an increase in the rate
of cancer.

The institute will rely heavily on
the Magnetic Resonance Institute,
which is being built on the parking
lot adjacent to Magee Hospital, to
further its efforts. This medical cen-
ter will house advanced X-ray equip-
ment, which could be a major
diagnostic tool in identifying cancer,
Leon said.

Each hospital has committed
$|00,000 annually to the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute. Pitt's medical
school will contribute $100,000
annually, and CMU will contribute
$50,000.

This initial funding is guaranteed
for five years, Leon said. He is hope-
ful that it will be boosted by private
foundation grants.

' The Pittfaculty holds an addi-
tional $6 million in cancer research
grants for this year, Leon said.

Once the program has been estab-
lished, the institute will request a
core grant from the National Cancer
Institute to support administration,
lab facilities, preparation of lab
space and clinical space.

In addition to funding, the Pitts-
burgh Cancer Institute is also look-
ing for a director. The director will
probably come from a well-
established cancer institute, Detre
said.

The director will bring with him a
staff of scientists and physicians and
will be responsible for overseeing
clinical care and investigation. In
addition, he will become a member
of the faculty of the medical school
to teach and supervise cancer educa-
tion, Leon said.

The best candidate will be “very
experienced yet still robustly pro-
ductive, vigorous and won't need to
sleep much,“ Detre said.

Robbery
suspect

nabbedin
North Side

By Patti Sechan
The Pitt News

An early morning raid ofa North-
side row house proved successful for
campus police and detectives who
had been searching for a suspect
connected with a series of armed
robberies which had occurred on the
Pitt campus in January.

Sgts. Gary Moses and Timothy
Delaney, Detective Kathy Heffron
and Officer Dominic Pizoli arrested
Robert Harris. 25. at I202 Boyle St.
on Wednesday and charged him
with four counts ofarmed robbery,
according to James Watters. assist-
ant director of public safety.

A warrant for Harris’ arrest had
been issued on March 5, after cam-
pus detectives showed photo arrays
to the robbery victims who identi-
fied Harris.

Because of Harris‘drifter lifestyle,
campus police and detectives had to
follow a path which began in East
Liberty and eventually led them to
the Northside. according to Watters.

After Harris was arrested, he was
taken to the No.9 city police station
and interrogated. Harris gave police
a sworn statement in which he con-
fessed to the four armed robberies
on the Pitt campus and gave police
information implicating himself in
at least five other armed robberies.
Watters said.

“We received information from a
staff worker in the Department of
Welfare in Pittsburgh that a Wayne
Harris fitting the suspect‘s descrip-
tion had applied for public assist-
ance," Watters said. Through this
application. police got the address
which led them to Harris.

At the time of Harris‘ arrest,
police found a “replica“ gun which
Harris had used in the robberies.

Campus police have turned Har-
ris over to the city police robbery
division for further investigation.

EDWARD CEIN: AMERICA'S
MOST BIZARRE MURDERER

By Judge Robert H. Gollmar
Pinnacle

Edward (3ein's peculiar hobbies
inspired two rather startling films:
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and Tobe
Hooper's Texas Chainsau) Massnrn’.
Intriguing. How?‘ Easy. In his Wis-
consin hometown, Cein murdered at
least two women, cut off their heads
and ”played" with various organs
("Her heart was found in a saucepan
on the stove.") and also borrowed the
bodies of a number of recently—buried
women and repeated the process.
Caught in late 1957 with his last vic-
tim hanging headless upside down in
a backyard shed, Cein was arrested
and incarcerated. Criminally insane.

Eleven years later, Cein faced trial
for his various activities. Presiding

This book ‘is written in the grand

Clavell and James Michener. At the
turn of every page, there's another
exciting twist in the plot.

Van Rjndt builds his futuristic
novel around the Polish Solidarity

embarks upon an amazing journey
that will affect the lives of everyone

ANGEL EYES
By Loren D. Estleman
Pinnacle

Amos Walker is a private eye, the
”his drink ‘is Scotch, his town is
Detroit, his best friend is a Smith &
Wesson" brand of detective. Humph-
rey Bogart would have played Amos
Walker in 1940, although Walker is
unmistakably an '80s’ make.

Angel Eyes is the new episode.
Author Loren Estleman has built his
shamus from classic hard-boiled
stock parts —- he stalks his beat and
dispenses his own peculiar maxims
and methods en route to the evi-
dence. The title figure dances in a
dive. She's in shady up to her assets
and suspects that she's about to dis-
appear. Before the fact, then, she
engagesyWalker to find her, paying
with a diamond ring -— his single clue.

  

HARD S/ITER

  

 

  

"I don't know how I'd play myself."
— Bingo O’Malley, Pittsburgh's first
or, anyway, best actor and Renais-
sance man, summing up quite some
life.

O’Malley defines himself first in
rough estimates: "About 35 plays" —
drama, comedy, on- and off-beat,
over the past nearly 15 years for 17 or
18 theater companies in this area
(Pittsburgh Laboratory, the Fine
Line, the Playhouse, Pitt and more).
What» about — ? "You can ask it, but I
won't answer it," O’Malley says. "For
the reason that I don't put a ‘lot of
stock in age. And for another and
probably more practical reason: in the
theatrical field, you get tagged with
an age...they'll put you into a niche.
They're so accustomed to categoriz-
ing you by age. Whatever you are
shows, I think, pretty much,
anyway.”

The beard is a permanent fixture as
well, at least mostly. It has either
been appropriate for the roles he's
played or directors have been willing
to overlook it for what's underneath.
Twice the beard came off in the name
of acting, but "It's never really inter-
fered," he says.

And the name is real. "That came
from a combination of Bing Crosby,
who played Father O’Malley in pic-
tures — Going My Way and Bells of St.
Mary's -— putting the two together.”
Bingo O’Malley, the resulting hybrid,

doesn't listen to Crosby's records. Or _

bother with the films. But the name?
"The name's great," he says.

Acting. "I_ never did." — study it. "I
got started in the navy," unusual as
that sounds. O'Malley's division
clocked for two months in Key West,
Fla. An accident: hearing about audi-
tions for Richard Nash's The Rain-
maker, courtesy of a local — although
mostly Northern — artists’ colony. "I
went and tried out and got the part."'
—— his first performance, helped along
by an "outstanding" woman director.
"Talk about introduction to theater.
She was as theatrical as you can get,"
O’Malley says. "A great experience.
And so I acted there for two months
and even went AWOL for a day or
two so that I could finish the play."

STORY BY RIC

"The whole experience was...it’s
the kind that once it gets in your
blood, you don't very easily get it back
out again." But the first one remained
"a happening" for several years.
"There was — I guess — something
brewing underneath, but I was refus-
ing to look at it at the time." Someone
pushed; "steam-rolled from there
on," O’Malley says. "I've really been
acting since about 1970. That's when
I really went at it." Ira Wallach's
Absence of a Cello provided the vehicle, a
ride with the Characters East com-
pany, and he was caught.

"I love the rehearsal process," he

' says —— the scheduled time for grow-

ing into the part. "I think you just
have to know the character inside and
out as much as you can." And O’Mal-
ley supplements gut feeling with
research for non—fictional roles. For
the rest, and interestingly, O’Malley
examines the script to figure out the
character's astrological sign for a pos-
sible hook into motivation.
Approach? Always method; internal.
"Things that you've felt, seen, expe-
rienced, heard [are] coming together
in some combinations. You might be
selecting little portions here and

there...you're trying to match them
up with what the playwright
intended.”

And no inhibitions. "Not yet,”
O’Malley says. "If I thought it was
justified, I would 0 it." Anything.
And why (for him as an actor and a
man and everyone else in general, as
well): "Name it; we're capable of it."

Where all of him came from: of
decidedly Irish parentage and one of
four offspring, O’Malley was born/
raised in Pittsburgh. Attended St.
Vincent's college; studied philosophy
and didn't complete the degree -
entered the navy and the seminary
afterwards. "It's no secret; I was a
priest at one time — for two years.
That's what I'd been going to St. Vin-
cent's for." He left the priesthood; "I
no longer believed in God. That sort
of does it most of the time." To Pitt
for social work; "Afterwards, I came
out and worked at juvenile court. I
was a probation officer for about four
years and then went into social
work.”

Curr‘entIy with the Pittsburgh
Board of Education, "I am a social
worker with emotionally disturbed

children, mainly, and others who
aren't categorized as such, but

A troubled children. Most of your work

involves counseling with them and
with the parents as well...trying to
make the kind of changes that will

affect their lives positively — wha‘-W

tever that means.... It's not so cut-and
dried," O’Malley says. A full-time job,
but he upkeeps that other career -
the acting —— as well.

Prerequisites: "I can't do a part
where I don't like the character. I
have to like him." Naturally, there are
different degrees of "like," although
O’Malley confesses "no bad experien-
ces." Standout roles: Max, a homo-
sexual incarcerated in a German

concentration camp in Martin Sher-gt;

man's Bent; Andrew Carnegie; Da, in
Hugh Leonard's same—titled piece,
O'Malley's most recent work; and a
schizophrenic Jesus Christ/Jack the
Ripper in Peter Barnes’ The Ruling
Class.

The beard went for Bent, painfully
poignant drama. O’Malley read Car-

negie's autobiography and other pos,§....

itive writings to fashion the magnate
into a heroic man. "Different plays
surprise you with how they're going
to be difficult or relatively simple" in
terms of emotional or physical out-
put, "especially if you're drawing so
much from yourself. I guess if you
were acting exteriorly, a play like Da
you could do as long as you've got the
brogue down, you've got the wal _
down, and you could just deliver the
lines."

But Da, a coming-to-terms
between a man and his deceased
adoptive parents and situated in Ire-
land, struck close to home. "Things I
thought had been settled in my per-
sonal life were all of a sudden coming
back through this character, and it
was very difficult to deal with, espe-
cially toward the end of the play. I
was able to set them aside for a whilﬂ,
as I was doing it."

The Ruling Class proved most
demanding all the way around,
although "I had played Christ," he
says, referring to his stint in the
church. "It's not hard. I think we all
play Christ at various times in our

TV life..

B life.... Why do you choose social
work? Or why do you go into the
priesthood to begin with? Some
burning mission or some kind of self-
sacurifice. We do have those aspects.
Any time that we feel that things

thing about changing them, we're
being Christ-like, so to speak," he
says. A

O’Malley has resisted typecasting;
not dependent upon acting for the
room and board, he enjoys the satis-
faction of choosing his plays. "Part of
your own enjoyment sometimes is
the message that's in it —— how it
touches you personally. If it says
something to you, you're hoping

gthat, also, that same message, that
same effect and maybe that same
uplifting — if that's all it is ——— is there
for somebody else as well. So there's a
kind of sharing that goes on with act-
ing.” —— an important side benefit.

"A smart director, I think, will let it
come from you, and [he will] shape it
gently." Aiming for sense is the

‘ctor's responsibility. "It's a give-and-
take all the time. Or it should be, and
that's assuming the director is doing
his job and the actor is doing his,"
constructing reality for the play. As
an actor, "you build it for yourself,"
and it will be there for the audience as
well. "I don't want to see the mechan-
ics of it all," he says for acting or

‘ directing. And, from his rare vantage

oint as audience, "I'm there to be
entertained.

"I don't work on acting outside. I
think working on life is enough -
just observation," he says. But he
believes in the commitment; other-
wise, "I_ wouldn't want to" stay with
it. "I don't see myself ever retiring
from anything. I can see myself stop-
ping...and picking up something
else," he says. "I guess I could stop
today. If it wasn't my choice, I'd feel

‘Ieprived/'

More dislikes. "I don't have to audi-

O'Malley says. Reputation precedes
him; directors call him, now. "Any
actor knows that's desired," and he
doesn't complain. "I don't like to audi-

Acting for movies and television in
particular. "It inhibits creativity
when you think of the creative pro-
cess as a kind of flow. Your problem is
in readjusting to creativity on
demand, 'now,' " he says from prac-
tice. O'Malley featured in Panic in the
Wilderness, an independent film pro-
duction, and played small parts in
Creepshow and others. And among his
TV work, portrayed avant-garde
artist John Kane (without the beard)
in a one—man performance for PBS.
He admits stage experience is

"handy," even when subjected to the

chalk-marked limitations of film and
video.

Something more pleasantIPitts-

here all my life. Pittsburgh is a kind of

down-to-earthiness that has evolved

of the people," he explains, choosing
words carefully. "I think Pitts-

‘burghers -— these are talking in very

broad generalizations —- are less pre-
tentious.... I like that." And versatile.
"You have to rub elbows to get lost in
any particular group, whether that
group be a nationality, or a religion or
no religion, or age."

A sore spot: ”I like Pittsburgh and
don't want to leave it, and to say that
to make something of yourself in act-
ing —— that you have to go to New
York or Los Angeles — I resent that.
As a Pittsburgher, I resent that. I'd
like to see theater develop here, and
I'd like to stay here," he says. "I'd like
to think that anybody could do it
here, in terms of a kind of fulfillment.
Not monetary —— you're not going to
get the money here and not going to
get the acclaim or whatever it is that
goes with New York."

"I am a Taurus," he says. "And
Tauruses tend to take root and want
a bit of the earth to call their own. I
took the whole city." Affectionately.

Astrology —— one science which
O'Malley has found trustworthy

"through practice." He has his chart

drawn up yearly according to his‘

birthdate. "It explains a lot about the
basic character of a person, not so
much predicting," he says; it prompts
an awareness of personality and
temperament.

"Acting is a part of my life, and not
my entire life. I don't want anything
to be my entire life. I like to have
different facets to it," O'Malley says.
"I like to have a. range to choose
from." He has it: sees theater when
he can; reads some drama ("less of it
than I'd like to"); enjoys viewing
movies; and used to be better at the
piano. "I'd like to be able to write,"
plays in particular. He paints, redeco-
rates the house, goes through
"nothing spells" aimed at pure relaxa-
tion. Add family obligations and the
social work. O'Malley keeps the
options balanced but flexible.

Has been interviewed locally -
radio, television, the news, Pittsburgh
Magazine —- and featured. "I've grown
accustomed to it," he says, looking at
the process as a sort of "one-sided
conversation” with the theater—going
public. "I enhance it [acting] in some
way.... You do it for yourself first —
you start there —— but then it's nice
when it's expanded a little bit_ and
appreciated by someone else.

O'Malley is on hiatus now; a three-
play run at Pittsburgh Lab —— The Gin
Game, A Izsson from Aloes, Da —— has
kept his nights busy since August. "I
never know what part I want to play,"
he says, keeping an open mind for the
future. "After I've read it, and if I can
hook into it, anything's game."

Bingo. ‘ »

A continuing consciousness 0
politics. Likes jazz, the older stuff;
Chopin; doesn't collect stamps.

Unmarried, sans birthmarks and —‘

champagne and cigarettes aside --
bad habits. ”My little secret —- I'll
always love Lana Turner." Warning:
"You can get into ruts too easily,"
although he hasn't anything to worry
about. Will he hazard a guess — at-
tach a percentage —— on how much of
himself is dedicated to acting? "When
I'm doing it," says O'Malley, "it's a
hundred percent."

Thomas Dolby

REEL VINYL

THE FLAT EARTH
Thomas Dolby
Capitol Records

With a cinematic flourish nor-
mally associated with a gifted
film director, Thomas Dolby
has brought to vinyl one of the
years most engrossing aural
experiences with the release of
his second lp, The Flat Earth.

No longer to be thought of as
simply a synthesizer wiz kid,
Dolby proves on The Flat Earth
that his musical gifts are of far

greater depth and variety. The .

dream-like atmosphere of rom-
ance and reflection that the
record maintains throughout
are the result of Dolby’s well-
established production skills, as
well as his expanding songwrit-
ing talents.

Although the album begins
("Dissidents") and ends
("Hyperactive") with two explo-
sive numbers charged full of
electricity, it is the mood Thom-
as Dolby creates between these
bookends of boiling funk that
sets the tone of this excellent

record. The title track, inspired
by a soft nightclub piano intro,
quietly urges that ”The earth
can be any shape you want it,
any shape at all.” The soft
spoken suggestion that we
determine our own outlook
comes through loud and clear in
spite of Dolby’s understated
delivery.

”Screen Kiss," with its lush
arrangement and dreamy
horns, and ”I Scare Myself" are
further proof that Thomas Dol-
by’s music has moved beyond
the threshold of mere listening
pleasure. These songs demon-
strate perfectly the emotional
sensitivity that separates The
Flat Earth from the majority of
today's popular music.

In scoring one of last years
most memorable singles with
the addictive, offbeat ”She
Blinded Me With Science," Tho-
mas Dolby was widely credited
with being one of a precious few
synthesizer practitioners to
place human concerns above
technological ones. With the
release of The Flat Earth, Thomas

    
    

Dolby has made a great leap for-
ward. In showing an ability to
create songs that clearly evoke
emotion and response on the
part of the listener, he has
joined a select group of musi-

cians that has truly earned the
distinction of being called
recording artists.

SOUL MINING
The The
Epic

So, how is your ear for lyrics?
It better be sharp, durable and
poised for Soul Mining by The
The (Stop. Push tongue back in
mouth.).

The lp begins with an angry,
pulsating number, ”I've Been
Waitin' for Tomorrow (All of
My Life)/’ Booming, punchy
drumming that will shake your
fillings loose. Like it. "Another
year over and what have I done?/My
aspirations have shriveled in the
sun/I'm crippled by guilt, blinded by
science/I've been waiting for tomorrow
all of my life."

The expressions of a polluted,
apathetic mind set the attitude
for the remaining seven tracks,
all very wordy, like little stories

set to music, but often muddled
so badly by the instrumentation
that one must press his head to
the speaker and clench his teeth
to grab snippets of lyric.

Big problem.‘ If this album
were any thinner, musically, it
would be in danger of slipping
through its spindle hole. The
seductive, eerie feel that is
established by way of the per-
cussion and synthesizers on
track one is abandoned for a sof-
ter tone in ”This Is The Day,"
the follow-up cut. More croon-
ing, less angst. ”All the money
in the world couldn't bring back
those days." The character
keeps bumping head—first into
brick walls....

At first listen, this album
drew more contempt than any-
thing else. It seemed like some
wonderful musical textures --

from the primitive to the '60s’
pop of ”Perfect” — were being
served up in a series of tape
loops, repetitive, tiresome and
on and on...Ugh...as if Matt
Johnson had written a few bars
for each number and then
stretched them out in order to
fill the time requirement of an
lp. The songs are all too long,
and ”Giant" on side two, clock-
ing in at 9:36, is so monotonous
that I decided to shave and listen
to the middle section from the
bathroom. Few songs justify
this kind of length (and we all
can blow raspberries at ”Hey
Jude" for that).

Just a thought. Perhaps the
monotony is intentional. The
premise of the album is one of
boredom, the run-of—the-mill,
the apathetic. ”l’ll hang an
empty smile beneath my empty
eyes and go out for a walk." For
all but the most patient listen-
ers, this probably wouldn't be a
bad idea.

IEEFREY SEWALD

, HEARTBEAT CITY

The Cars
Electra Asylum

The new record by the Cars is
a little overdue, maybe a little
self-congratulatory. It's been
two years since Shalce It Up, but if
you can remember, Mr. Ocasek
came out with a solo album last
year, so he can't quite be
accused of letting his creative
juices cool down and stagnate.
On the other hand, when you
consider the uneven quality of
that solo album or, better yet,
the name, Beatitude — which
means, ”the quality or state of
being blessed” —— you might
think that ol’ Ric thinks he's
afflicted with a musical Midas
Touch or that he corners the
market on teenage romantic
obsession.

The Cars’ first two records

developed what was a new and
very hip commodity: intelligent
rock songs with crystal-clear
production, a lot of pelvis and a
funny, very nasal voice -— smart
and simple — what every col-
lege boy dreams of. The third
record was a big step towards
even greater sophistication and,
not unexpectedly, a commercial
disaster, at least in relation to
the first two. Panorama was filled
with lurching electronic pat-
terns, very austere and very
stark, of course, a metaphor for
human relations.

The Cars’ last record and this
one, Heartbeat City, are two of a
kind: a neat melding-together of
lean, power-riff pop songs and
the more moody, electronic bal-
lads that they introduced on
Panorama. Adding to the possibil-
ities of the new record is the use
of the Fairlight CMI, a $28,000
musical computer best known
for Peter Gabriel's use of it on
his last album.

The album's opener, ”Hello
Again," might be Ric greeting
himself. It's about someone
really glad to see someone, per-
haps after a two—year hiatus.
(OK, no more cheap shots.) This
song is not the most memorable
Cars melody, but the sick
trumpet sound they invented is
fun, and the production, of
course, is an instrument unto
itself.

”Looking for Love" comes
next, and it's a perfect example
of the Cars’ two styles fused
into one song. It's got the
repeating electronic figures
weaving patterns around each
other and the tight pop melody
keeping the song upbeat, with a
plea to live for the moment --

”take advantage.-..kill the lights
...you can't stop." ”Magic”
hearkens back to the Cars’ first
record. It features the raunchy,
grinding, three—chord power-
pop that made ”Best Friend's
continued on page seventeen

c0"”"“edfF0rn page sixteen

Girl" so immediately likeable.
And if the guitar assault doesn't
get you, it's the boys in the band
singing, "Oh, Oh, It's magic."
Ocasek’s vocals grab you and
make you believe in puppy dog
love. What more can a song do?

The single "You Might
Think” is a classic Cars song
with a Springsteen-like piano-
romp thrown in. Ric goes for
the ultimate sincerity-
establisher here. He sings acou-
ple of lines a capella so you can
hear the heat in his voice.

One more noteworthy trick:
on "Drive," a seamless mix of
electronics and voice is estab-
lished. It's ethereal and beauti-
ful and reminds one of 10cc
doing "I'm not in Love."

The Cars haven't evolved
during their two years off.
They've just refined a mixture

of attributes that they've‘

already amply demonstrated:
flawless production, great use
of new electronics, tight little
pop songs, teenage angst and
Ocasek's quirky voice. It's
(excuse the expression) just
what I needed.

MICHAEL SELZ

OBLIVION
Utopia
Passport

o—bliv-i-on -— (n) 1: forgetful-
ness 2: the quality or state of
being forgotten. An appropriate
title for this latest piece of dis-
posable vinyl from Todd
Rundgren, still painfully per-
sistent after all those jeers.

The album's 10 tracks (includ-
ing some wonderful titles like
”Winston Smith Takes It On
The law" and "Bring Me My
Longbow”) jostle the listener
about, not in an inspired musical
jet flight but more closely akin
to an irritating ride on a
crowded bus. What a relief
when it's over.

From the opening number,
”Itch In My Brain," the album is
a head scratcher (couldn't res-
ist). Much of it is reminiscent of

mainstream guitar —- the inex- _

haustible quest for the great

riff, which has eluded Mr.

Rundgren again (for God's
sakes, Todd, let someone else
produce and engineer for once).
The vocals evolve into hazy,
multi-tracked choruses that
serve only to negate any vitality
that may have existed before
the mix.

All right. Who hid the bass
track for this album? I know
there's one in there somewhere.
Much too subdued. ”Tinny."

With Oblivion, Rundgren is

_ trying to find a niche, dabbling

in keyboards and some pro-
gramming, but these come off
too haphazardly, like smatter-
ings of different styles. Out of
place.

About the only salvageable
piece of material occurs at the
outset of side two. ”Maybe I
Could Change" begins with a
piano-bar style intro and then
weaves its way into typical Todd
Rundgren: full vocals and a sen-
timental pop consistency — old
stuff — that further emphasizes
the album's problem as a whole.
Stale, Todd. Stale.

MY WAR
Black Flag
SST Records

At its best, hardcore was
America's most legitimate
delayed reaction to the British
punk movement. Poorly done,
however, the sound varied little
from mindless heavy metal.
Formed around a handful of
California bands, most notably
the Dead Kennedys, worth-
while hardcore was unrepent-
ant in its lyrical viewpoint and
alarmingly direct in its musical
approach. Unfortunately, My
War, the latest release from Los
Angeles’ Black Flag, offers pre-
cious little of hardcore’s finer
touches.

Although the tortured sing-
ing of vocalist Henry Rollins
does create a disturbed feeling
of personal despair on My War,
the theme is more often than

, not indulgent and is rarely sup-

ported with much instrumental
precision. In fact, after the
thrashing title track provides an
excellent testimonial to the
band's outlook, followed by the
record's finest moment, the
agonizing "Can't Decide," My
War slips into a creative coma.
"Beat My Head Against the
Wall," "Three Nights" and

 BI.ACI< FLAG

”Scream" all expose the diffi-
culty of making nihilism a sal-
ient musical viewpoint.

With the exception of the first
two cuts, My War fails to distin-
guish itself in any particular
way. The singing of Rollins is
far tootdramatic for any of the
lyrical content and becomes an
annoyance by the time side two
runs down. Guitarist Greg
Ginn, bass player Dale Nixon
and drummer Bill Stevenson

further complicate Black Flag's
dilemma by ”creating" a sound
that is completely lacking
substance.

’ For the Sex Pistols, being
offensive gave recognition to
the band and its radical outlook.
My War, on the other hand, is
offensive mostly for its lack of
thoughtfulness and inability to
generate enthusiasm.

Winner catapults to NIT Final Four

By Joe Zeff
‘The Pitt News

There is absolutely no truth to the
rumor that metal backboards will
replace the fiberglass ones at Fitzgerald
Field House tonight. However, another
schoolyard standard, the red-white-
and-blue basketball, will be utilized.

Some 7,000 fans will crowd the play-
ground - er, field house - for tonight’s
National Invitation Tournament quar-

‘erfinal between Pitt and Notre Dame at

8 p.m. The game will be televised locally
on Channel ll.

Notre Dame has never played basket-
ball in Fitzgerald Field House. Of their
past meetings, each team has won 15 of
the 30 games. They have never met in
the NIT.

The Irish are led by 6-4 senior guard
Tom Sluby, who is averaging 18.4
points per outing. Sluby isjoined in the
backcourt by junior Joe Howard (5.l
ppg). Sophomores Tim Kempton and
Jim Dolan and freshman Donald Royal
compose the Notre Dame front line.

Notre Dame, coached by legendary
Digger Phelps, sports a 19-11 record,
including NIT wins over St. Peter's and
Boston College. Pitt, with tournament

victories over LaSalle and Florida
State, is 18-12.

The Panthers creamed Notre Dame
at South Bend earlier in the season 67-
59. Pitt established a 29- I 8 halftime lead
and retained it through the second half.

But the Irish played without their 6-
I0‘ center, Tim Kempton, who was
injured.

“The beef is back," said Phelps at
Wednesday’s media luncheon. “We
found the beef. What can I tell you?
Without him, we were 3-6; with him, we
are l6—5.“

Pitt has a few potent players of its
own. Billy Culbertson, the 6—'l senior

guard, had his best game of the season
against Notre Dame, registering 18
points, five assists and four steals.
Senior Clyde Vaughan is rabidly pursu-
ing the 2,000-point meridian; he now
has 1,991 and is the school’s all-time
leading scorer.

The Panthers .are ready. Guard
George Allen has averaged 16 points per
game in the tournament. Center Keith
Armstrong has been shooting at an 82
percent rate from the floor in the last
three games. Chip Watkins has snared
I6 rebounds and scored 24 points from
the bench in the tournament.

The Pitt News

Its been a banner year for the
Lady Panther gymnastics team,
whose list of accomplishments is
long enough to seemingly make
them the best women‘s team Pitt
has ever seen.

But the records and the wins
piled up this season will be mean-
ingless Saturday when Pitt trav-
els to Penn State to compete in
the NCAA eastern regional
competion.

Pitt is going into the meet with
a strong, fine-tuned lineup, but

it will need a good performance
to overtake their two toughest
competitors —— Penn State and

I think we ‘re ready. We can beat-those teams,
but its going to be a‘ dogﬁght.

—— Lisa Shirk

Ohio State respectively. Pitt is
going into the regional competi-
tion seeded third behind Penn
State and Ohio State
respectively.

The Lady Panthers were given
a real boost on Wednesday when

All-America Lisa Shirk was
given clearance to work out after
a doctor’s examination. Accord-
ing to assistant coach Frank
Klein, Shirk was given a corti-
sone injection to relieve pain due
to swelling in her leg muscles.

Lady gymnasts employ colorful strategy

According to Klein, Shirk will
be ready to go in the all around
competition and has worked out
twice since the injection. Klein
said that the rest she received
before the diagnosis was the key
to her recovery.

“I think we‘re ready,” Shirk
said earlier this week. “We can
beat those teams, but it's going to
be a dogfight. Whoever hits and
stays on the beam is going to win
the meet.“

Shirk said the Pitt team has
worked hard to make last-
minute improvements in its rou-
tines. She also said that seniors
Karen Martin and Babbie Flock
have been doing the best routines
she has seen from them in their
four years together.

lnevitably, it had to happen. Mis-
takes caused by lack of practice time
outdoors caught up with the Pitt
baseball team in its tour of Florida.

After playing a reasonably flaw-
less opener, the Panthers’ problems
began to show. Walks, errors and
mental mistakes dominated losses to
Florida State, 21-] in the first game

’~ of a doubleheader Wednesday, and

Florida A&M yesterday, l3-6.

Only zfsolid pitching performance
from Tom Seebacher prevented a
third rout, as the Seminoles shutout
Pitt in the second game, 5-0.

“Its a big advantage to practice
on a field rather than indoors,” Pitt
head coach Bobby Lewis said.
“When we practice in the [Fitzge-
rald] Field House, there is no wind
and there’s a different background
to hit and catch balls. Plus, there’s
no room to practice long cutoff
throws, which has hurt us the last
three games.

“If we could have had a week of
practice outdoors before this trip,
we would have been in better shape."

The effects of practicing indoors
were evident in the pitching. The
Panther hurlers, not yet accustomed
to throwing offa mound, were wild,
especially against Florida State.

Starter Frank Craska retired only
one Seminole batter, as the fire-
balling righthander gave up eight
runs  seven earned on three hits.
while walking four batters.

For the game, Craska, Ken Hus-
tava, Dave Scala, Mike Shannon
and Rich Garvan combined to give
out 19 bases on balls, only one away
from setting a Panther record, no
matter how dubious.

“We just couldn‘t find the plate.”
Lewis said. “In this game, we didn’t
have any breaks at all."

Jim Cosgrove was another
Panther pitcher with a string of mis-
fortune. ln yesterdays game, the
lefthander was stung for 12 runs and
11 hits in three innings. as the
Rattlers got their 13 runs in the first
five innings.

However, the news from the
mound was not all downcast.
Although Seebacher gave up five
runs in 6 1/3 innings, those statistics
shadow the junior lefthander’s per-

- formance, as he allowed only ﬁve

hits, striking out five.

“Tom pitched well,” Lewis said.
“It was his first time out, and he tired
out, but I was impressed.”

Another outing which pleased
Lewis was the three relief innings
tossed by Chris Jelic yesterday. The
reserve Panther quarterback put his
right arm to good use, not allowing a
hit in his stint while striking out
three Florida A&M batters.

“They didn’t hit a ball out of the
infield off Chris," Lewis said. “He
throws hard and throws strikes.

“He could be our Goose
Gossage.”

Besides finding a reliever, there
have been other impressive perfor-
mances. Firstbaseman Tom Horew
was perfect from the plate yesterday,
hitting four singles and drawing a
walk. Horew also ‘delivered the
Panthers’ first run of the young sea-
son, cracking a home run in the sev-‘
enth inning in the first game’
Wednesday.

In general, however, Pitt is eag-
erly awaiting its first win after four
straight defeats. Perhaps they are
too anxious.

“Maybe they are trying too hard
to make things happen,” Lewis said.

The first victory could come today
at 2 p.m in a rematch with Florida
A&M. Aaron Krause makes his
second start of the season for the
Panthers, after his complete game
performance Monday. ’

Regardless of the outcome, the
tour is a success as far as Lewis is
concerned, but he does have one
regret.

“I wish we could have been here
for three weeks.”

Wrestler Jeff J elic pins down dental school admission

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News I ‘A

“When I started at Pitt, I set two
goals for myself,” said Pitt wrestler
.leff Jelic. “I wanted to be accepted
into Pitt's dental school and to
become an All-America. The main
goal though was dental school.”

His acceptance into dental school
came shortly before he was crowned
All-America at the NCAA Wres-
tling Championships in New Jersey
on March I0.

Jelic was happy with his All-
America status, but would rather
have won the NCAA championship,
instead of placing fifth.

“I was out to win the [NCAA]
championship," Jelic said. “I am
happy to be an All-America, but I
would like to have finished higher. I
wanted to win, and I feel like I had to
settle for something less."

Panther head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer was happy with Jelic‘s
performance.

“Jeff did an outstanding job,“
Stottlemyer said. “It was a great way
to cap a fine career at Pitt. He really
earned his All-America title. In
wrestling, you either place or you
don't; there are no other ways to
become an All-America. Jeff placed
and he earned his status."

Jelic, who won the Eastern Wres-
tling League Championship three
times, twice as the IS8-lb. champion,
and this year, as the I67-lb. cham-
pion, became the winningest
wrestler in Pitt history when he
recorded his 69th career victory this
season. He surpassed Coach Stot-
tlemyer, who held the previous
record of 68 victories.

Jelic not only contributes to the
team with his victories and winning
ways, but he also provided leader-
ship for the team. He was a three-
time team captain and a proven
team leader.

“Jeff has a good inﬂuenceon the
team," said fellow Panther wrestler
Frank Rich. “He is a good leader."

Jelic‘s family has a long record of
sports success. His father Ralph was

' a two-year letterman at running

back for the Pitt football team, and
his mother Cynthia was an out-
standing athlete in Pitt's intramural
system. His brother Chris is a sopho-
more quarterback on the Pitt foot-
ball team and plays the outfield for
the Panther baseball team. The
youngest Jelic, Jane, is a sophomore
on the Mt. Lebanon volleyball team.

It was his father who got Jelic
started in wrestling. “I used to play
football in junior high, but when I

got to the ninth grade and only

weighed 90 pounds, my dad encour-

‘aged me to get out of it," Jelic said.

“When my dad coached at
Lehigh, I used to hear stories about
wrestlers there. I started out by wres-
tling in the living room at home for
the fun of it. I would also wrestle in
thejunior high during the off season
for something to do. Then, when I
got to high school, I chose wrestling
as my sport."

His family has offered a lot of sup-
port and has helped him through
some rough spots.

“My junior year was frustrating
for me," Jelic said. “I cut a lot of
weight. When that happened, there
was a change in my mental attitude.
It helped having my family close by
to encourage me. They would not
always pat me on the back in order
to help; instead my dad would some-
times yell at me, and that is what I
needed."

His family attends all home
matches but does not put a lot of
pressure on him. Instead, he putsthe
pressure on himself.

“Before each match, I set certain
goals for myself. If I don’t achieve
those goals, I am unhappy; ifl do, I
am happy."

Although Jelic may be a little too
tough on himself, he does have a
winning attitude, which he credits to
his father.

“My father always told me to
work hard and to doiiwhat ever it
takes. If you work hard and do all
that you can do, then good things
will come to you. You get what you
work for." .

If that statement holds true, then
Jelic should have a lot more good
things happening to him. He is a
hard worker, both in sports and in
the classroom. Regardless of his
busy schedule, he’s able to maintain
a B average and was named to the
dean’s list in his first two years. He
say that it is difficult to manage his
schedule, but he does a fine job with
it.

“It is not easy to maintain a stu-
dent-athlete role,”Jelic said. “I have
to arrange my schedule around
wrestling. The team works out at 8
a.m. for about an hour and a half.
We usually just run and lift weights
then. After that, I go to class, and

It was a great way to cap a fine career at Pitt.
He really earned his All-America title.

- Randy Stottlemyer

then back to practice at 3 o’clock.
After all that, I have to manage
going to night classes. I am usually
very tired at the end of the day, and
during the season. I go to bed
around 10 o'clock.”

Even ‘though Jelic dedicates a lot
of his time to sports, he does not feel
as if he’ is missing out on anything.
Instead, he sees those who don’t get
involved in activities as the ones
misﬂng out.

1th all the time he spends in his

own sport, plus the time he spends
supporting his brother at football
games and his sister at volleyball
games, one would think that he
would want to do something not
dealing with sports in his free time.
But he spends a. lot of time support-
ing other Pitt teams, especially the
non-revenue ones.

“I know what it is like to compete
in a non-revenue sport," Jelic said.
“You don't get the attention and
support that football and basketball

get. That is why I like to go to other

games and meets. I like to give them *

support.” J elic has attended an event
for every sports team at Pitt.

Jelic, who will be graduatingthis
term, sees dental school as being the
most important part of his future.

“I am not sure if I will continue
into amateur wrestling," Jelic said.
“On one hand, I would like to go on
and see how good I can become,
while on the other hand, I think it is
time I got out of sports. For now,
though, I am -thinking about dental
school for my future plans.”

It has required a lot of hard work
and dedication, but Jelic never
regrets having gotten involved in
wrestling.

“I have had to make a lot of sacri-
fices, but I do not regret any of that,”
Jelic said. “I have learned a lot.
There are a lot of benefits to compet-
ing. It makes you a better person."

__,n 1886, following a shipwreck off the west coast of Africa, an infant
child became part of a family of apes who raised and protected him.

As he grew, he learned the laws of the jungle and eventually claimed
the title, Lord of the Apes.

Yet, years later, when he was returned to civilization, he would remain
uncertain as to which laws he should obey. . those of man. .. . |
or those of the jungle.

Now, the director of “Chariots of Fire” captures this epicladventure
of a man caught between two different worlds.

“Ohio State is our biggest compe-
tition. We beat Penn State once; we
can do it again,” sophomore Kristy
Pieters said. “Our attitudes are up.
and that’s what you need.”

Team coach Donna Sanft said her
team has really looked good this
week in practice. “In my opinion,
Karen Martin has never looked bet-
ter. And Alisa Spector is excellent."

Sanft said that Flock has made
tremendous improvement in the last
two weeks. “We're definitely going
’to have higher scores with her,”
Sanft said.

Flock said she was nervous about
the meet, not because of a lack of
experience, but rather because she
wanted to do well in the meet.

“I’ve thought a lot more this
week,” Flock said. “I’ve done the
mental work, and my vault and
beam seem to be improved.”

The regional team competition
will be contested by Penn State,
Ohio State, Pitt, New Hampshire,
Bowling Green and Kent State.

Sanft said she is concerned about
how the rhythm of the meet will
affect her competitors. Sanft said
that she plans to give each girl a
coloring book to keep her mind off
of what the other schools are doing.

“I don’t want them watching the
other teams and saying, ‘Jeez they’re
good,‘ so they can color to keep
calm,” Sanft said. .

The team traveled to Happy Val-

Polonia
brings spring
to Pittsburgh

By Linda Schwabenbauer
The Pitt News

Believe it or not, spring is poking its head
around the corner, bringing with it warmer
weather, clearer skies and brighter colors.
Among these bright colors will be the cos-
tumes of the Polonia Song and Dance
Ensemble, scheduled to hold its second
annual performance at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial on Sunday, March 25.

“The Polish people like a lot of color. It's

. one of the key characteristics of this [cul-

ture],”said Tim Kuzma, who teaches chore-
ography to the groups 35 dancers.
Purchasing each costume in Poland from
peasants and cottage-industry factories, the
ensemble has amassed 250 individual cos-
tumes of 10 different styles.

The group will perform a variety of Polish
dances, from the formal Polonez and Mazur
to the peasant dances of Rzeszow, Lubin,
Warmia and Podhale. While dancing
remains at the heart of the performance,
singing was introduced last year to add a
new dimension. Three or four regional suites
will be performed, using both visuals and
vocals.

“We try to perpetuate the [Polish] cul-
ture,” said Kuzma, who added that although
most of the dancers are Polish, there are also
Lithuanians and Germans, among others.
The average age of the dancers is around 18,
with the youngest being 11 and the oldest
being in his 30’s.

This summer, the ensemble plans to trek
to Baltimore for a week-long Polish folk
dance festival. Polish dance companies from

to Kuzma, it is a place to“learn, perform and
show other people what we can do."

The ensemble also looks forward to per-
forming at the Pittsburgh Folk Festival,
which is held during the last weekend in May
in the Convention Center. Twenty-five dif-
ferent troupes, representing several different
nationalities, will participate in the festival,
which was held in the Civic Arena until
recently.

Sunday‘s performance will begin at 3
p.m. and will feature Jan Lewan, who has
recorded a number of records and is well-
known in both America and Poland. Tickets
are available by calling 745-9339 or 266-
5746. ~
