PPC: High Quality ConcertsAt Low Cost

By Scott DELLETT

Because of disappointing atten-
dance figures at major concerts, the
Pitt Program Council has decided
to go after high-quality groups at a
lower cost, PPC advisor Gina
Miller said.

The decision was made after a
one-year experiment to bring in

fmajor groups such as The Outlaws

and Chic ended up an expensive
failure, Miller said. Since these
g'roups have high honorium fees-

.dance

money that is paid up front to the
group before any other bills are
paid—-the Program Council
depended on gate receipts in order
to break even. Because poor attend-
to break even. Because poor atten-
made breaking even
impossible, PPC’s $70,000 concert
budget was cut. Miller declined to
reveal exactly how much.

“It's not feasible to bring in these
type of groups, since past interest
in concerts has been low,” Student
Coordinator Sue Dillingham said.

“It’s impossible, considering the
budget.”

Members of PPC have several
theories on why concerts at Pitt
don't draw well.

“Interest of this area is so
varied—I guess people aren't on
top of things,” Dillingham said.

- "It is either apathy or the high cost

of the concert. It’s a mystery to me.”-

“People prioritize what they
want to see,” Program Coordinator
Jimmy Gilliland said. “People can

,be selective with concerts here,

since they can go down to the Civic
Arena or the Stanley." ,
A possible solution was to bring

an outside promoter to help PPC

produce concerts. Danny Kresky,
president of Danny Kresky Enter-
prises, said he is willing to work
details provided “the facility were
made available.”

“I’m open to anything the
school would like to do,” Kresky
said, mentioning the easiest way is
for the school to get a certain per-

Business
School
Approved

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

The Pittsburgh City Council
approved the proposal for con-
struction of a $6.4 million
Graduate School of Business
and lot on March 15 and,
according to City Planning
Commissioner Mike O'Brien, T
construction will begin late this
summer or early next fall.

Pitt’s plans to expand the
Boundary Street parking lot by
80 additional spaces as part of
their plans to construct the
three-story building at Roberto
Clemente Drive and South Bou-
quet Street was met with criti-
cism from Oakland residents.

Members of the Oakland
Directors Inc. (ODI) worked
with the Pitt administration to
reach an agreement for the areas
in question.

“There was a time when
some of the residents on Boun-
dary Street didn’t think the
issues could be worked out,”
said ODI board member Sandy
Phillips. “But they've been
worked out."

Some of the concessions Pitt
made include: resurfacing the

‘entire parking lot, continuing
S to maintain grass and trees on
Boundary Street, allowing the
community to choose employ-
ment of the parking attendant
and providing a proper drain-
age system for water in the till
on the former backfield of
Forbes Field.

Prof Discusses Merits Of Sociobiology.

Dr. Alexander Rosenberg, asso-
ciate professor of philosophy and
social science at Syracuse Univer-
sity presented “The Plight of the
Social Sciences and the Proposals
of Sociobiology” in a talk spon-

' sored by the Center for Philosophy

of Science and the Department of
History and Philosophy of Science.

Sociobiology is the systematic,
scientific _study of the biological
basis of all forms of social behav-
ior:-all kinds of organisms, includ-
ing man.-

This new discipline incorpo-

«rates knowledge from ethology (the

naturalistic study of whole patt-
erns of behavior), ecology (the
study of the relationships of organ-
isms to their environment), and
genetics, in order to derive general
principles concerning the biologi-
cal constituents of entire societies.

Sociobiology is a subject based
.l*a"rigely on comparisons of social
species. Each living form, when
viewed as a product of millions of
yearsof interaction between genes
and environment, is used by the
sociobiologistto construct and test
the first general‘ principles of
genetic social evolutioh.

This . broad knowledge _ is--now
being applied’ to the study of

. human-beings. However, this con-

sideration of man is now being
from a
greater ‘than, usual. distance, as
compared‘ to the traditional
anthropocentric approach of the
social sciences. ' ’

Rosenberg admitted that while
“sociobiology is not year a disci-
pline to be respected for any actual
explanatory success and predictive
strengths,” it is “free from the ills
of conventional social sciences.”

  
  
  
 

directed by

Alexander Rosenberg, assitfesr of philosophy

and social science at Syracuse University, disclaimed
conventional -notions of social science while stressing

-sociobiology during a Pitt lecture yesterday.

The known laws of the various
social sciences, Rosenberg

explained, neither “uncover the

causal mechanisms of human
behavior” nor reach beyond state-
ments of generalities, though “they-
have been the common coin_of
their disciplines for -two hundred
years.” ‘

“Like others, I find the failure of
social sciences in its typological
commitments,” in its inability to
develop a “system of types of items,

‘properties, objects, events, and

states that did turn out to bear man-
ageable regular causal relations to
one another,” Rosenberg said.

Roth photo

Once this system is achieved, he
continued, “the sciences "have
uncovered their appropriate natu-
ral kinds.”. From these natural
kinds, “a kind-vocabulary for a
scientific theory” is developed.
,Only then, Rosenberg reasoned,
 “the first approximations to
§l#w.s” be discovered.
ﬁlfliosenberg cited one obvious
'-example of this uncovering of nat-
ural kinds. “Atomic theory owes its
real beginnings to the periodic
table of the elements, which finally
brought the objects of chemistry
into a system of types related to
each other in ways eventually

The fault that Rosenberg found
yvith the social sciences is in their

f“'}'(il.w beliefs about the natural
kinds; into which human behavior
and its determinants fall.”

Five premises were presented by
Rosenberg to support his argu-
ment of the social sciences’ enter-
taining false beliefs of typological
commitments.

1. The social sciences are all reso-
lutely intentional: they classify the
behavior to be explained as various
sorts of actions, and the variables
that explain it as various sorts and
combinations of desires and
beliefs.

2. All definitions of intentional
predicates must eventually resort to
their exemplification by Homo
sapiens. Intentional description of
the states and behavior of nonhu-
mans is either metaphorical, or
rests on analogies between such
behavior and paradigm human
intentionality.

3.Homo sapiens constitutes a
biological species. This is the least
conroversial of my premises.

4. The coherence of biological

‘ theory, and in particular the theory

of natural selection, dictates that
species names are not kind predi-
cates like ‘planet’ or ‘Oxygen’, but
are names of spatio-temporally rea-
tricted particular objects, like ‘the
Earth’ or ‘The Eiffel Tower’ or ‘the

Y

family Medi(‘i’—an object, allieiia
srattered one, just as a species is
scattered. _ l

.3. But no spatio-temporally res-
tricted particulars can figure in
general laws. Only “qualitive"
predicates my be so used. At best
names can figure in accidental reg-
ularities that explain nothing.

Therefore:

6. Homo sapiens names a spatio-
temporally restricted particular,
though scattered object, just as ‘the
family Medici’ does. family
Medici’ does.

Therefore:

7. There are no laws abon-1%‘

Homo sapiens, there are no-laws
about causal relations between
intentional states or between inten-
tional states and behavior, however
that behavior is described. In other
words there are no laws in the
social sciences; nor any prospect of
them so long as we persist in des-
cribing their subject matter in
terms that are spatio-temporally
restricted, that do not pick out nat-
ural kinds. ‘ _

“If we have to bet on the ques-

tion of what the narrowest natural .

kinds of human behavior and its
causes are, our safest bet will be the
natural kinds of the biological
sciences,‘

’ Rosenberg saiwj
“Accordingly, the research pro-

grams that deserve the most atten-
tion over the near term are those
most self-consciously biological in
their descriptions and their laws.”

The station ‘has changed the
air time of the popular soap
opera “General Hospital” to 3
p.m. in order to attract more col-
lege students.

Judy Girard of WTAE-TV
said the show will be switched
from its current air time of 9:30
a.m. to accomodate the college
crowd. She said most stations
across the country run the show
in the afternoon, and that
WTAE-TV had received com-
plaints about its early airing
time.

This week, the show is being
aired at both the old time and
the new time, and fans are get-
ting a double dose of the soap.

“The reason behind this is to
bring Pittsburgh viewers upto
date on the show‘s happen-
ings," Girard said.

Concerts
At Low Cost

continued from page one
centage of the piuius while Kresky
will put up the money, provided
the school would “do stuff to keep
the cost down.” . ,

The facility Kresky was referring

‘Lita: was the Fitzgerald Field House.

  

“It’s the only facility around the
campus where a show could be
done,” Kresky said, noting that the
Field House could hold between
five and six thousand people.

However, Miller said she dis-
agrees with having a concert prom-
oter taking over for the students.

“The purpose of the concert
committee is to learn how to pro-
mote a concert,” Miller said. She
also mentioned the difficulties of
arranging a concert at the Fiel
House. ‘

“The. last time we approached
the Field House, it would cost

, 7,000 to set up a concert up front,”
 iller said. “There's no way to get

around the facilities. We would
need the Field House for three con-
secutive days to set up, play, and to
tear down. With athletic events and
intramurals, there is no way to
reserve the Field House for this
amount of time.”

An alternative that Miller and
the Program Council are looking

. at is the use of David Lawrence

Hall, since there is no rental charge
and seating capacity is
appropriate.

“One thousand DCOPIC seems to
be the magic number of students
going to concerts," Gilliland said,
adding that the Silencers, Second

I City, the Amazing Kreskin and the

~L

Moral Majority debate drew well.

Though her figure is slightly
higher, Miller said she agrees with
Gilliland's theory. 7

“In years past, 1,500 people
would come to any concert, and it
has held up true this year,” Miller
said. “We have to get a group
whose honorium is commensurate
with an audience of 1500."

As for getting the major groups
without losing money, Miller said,
“It’s not impossible, but we
haven’t done_ it yet.”

Despite Changes, Women Face Economicbisparityr

By DIANE SCUILLO

Despite the tremendous change
in both the status of women in con-
stitutional doctrine and public
consciousness in the past decade,
“there is a growing disparity
between the ideal of equality and
the deteriorating reality of most
women’s economic situations,"
according to Professor Sylvia A.
Law.

Law spoke Monday as part of the
Mellon Lecture series sponsored by
the University of Pittsburgh
School of Law.

As evidence of this disparity,
Law said, in 1955, full-time work-
ing women earned 63.9 cents for
every dollar earned by men-—today,
females collect only 59 cents for
every dollar. And in 1950, the aver-
age income of families headed by
women was 56 percent of the
amount earned in families headed
by men and in 1979 that figure fell
to 46 percent.

Law cited four ways in which the
government contributes to the dis-

parity: federal statutes, sex segrega-
tion in the labor market and
devaluation of women’s work, the
Dictionary of Occupational Titles
used by the Department of Labor
and failure to recognize the needs
of children. She focused on the
government, she said, in part
because expectations of equality
and fair treatment are greater in
relationship to the government
than to private sectors.

“Perhaps the most blatant way
in which the government perpetu-
ates the second-class economic sta-
tus of women is the federal statute
that expressly mandates that every
needy father be given priority over
any woman in the distribution of
jobs and training opportunities
available through the United
States employment service,” said
Law.

But the more significant factors
in explaining the disproportionate
number of women in poverty are
those which involve sex segrega-
tion in the wage and labor market
and the devaluation of women’s
work in tht same market.

A 1980 study by the General
Accounting Office found that fed-
eral funding incentives encouraged
job deferrals on the traditional sex-

segregated basis, Law said.

“A third government contribu-
tion to feminization of poverty may

people-oriented women’s jobs,"

, said Law.

The most seriously devalued
jobs are the salaried derivitives of
homemaking and mothering, she
said.

Finally, perhaps the most perva-

Labor’s Ihctionary of Occupa-

and it systematically discriminates

sive government contribution, said
Law, is failing to recognize the
needs of children. Social custom,
religion and the law place a high
value on family-centered childrear-'
ing. Ordinary, full-time work
assumes that the worker does not

have the responsibility of children,
she said.
“Any ‘of us who do a big job."

Law said. “know that we need a »

wife. Most of us though, particu-
larly women, can't find them.”

Law cited a l98l Civil Rights
Commission Report in which
minority women are prevented
from taking paid work because of
inadequate or unavailable child
care. The lack of adequate child
care keeps them at part-time jobs
and interferes with career mobility,
Law said.

“In short, one plain message of
our welfare and labor policy is that
women do not belong in the work
and labor market," Law said.

Such laws and situations have
not been challenged, says Law,
because women’s rights lawyers are
over-worked, and poor women do
not comprise their major
constituencies.

Legal service lawyers have not
challenged them because they do
not believe their elimination
would result in any concrete

benefit for their clients, she said.

What function is served by fed-
eral policy disfavoring women in
the labor market? “It is e.\'tijemely
functional. In periods of high
unemployment. we can expect inar-
ginal women workers to leave the
labor force and reduce the official
unemployment rate," Law said.

“More fundamentally, it pro-
motes (women’s) dependence on
men,” she said.

Reasons for defending the prior-
ity of men in the labor force are also
found in such cultural values as
marital stability and family life,
and such publications as Wealth
and Poverty by George Gillard,
which defends this male priority
on the basis of men being more
aggressive physically, , needing to
fulfill the role of providing and
protecting or they will not be able
to cope, said Law. V .

“The preference for men is not
constitutionally defensible, as
there are individual women as
trainable as any man. There are
women who do not fit the stereo-

type to the extent stereotypes reflect
judgment on ability in the work
inarket. The priority disfayors the
woman who is able and eager as
any man , anddisfayors the woman
whose children are self sufficient. It
violates the core of the Supreme
(Iourt’s sex equality doctrine,” said
Law. '

This disfayorinent of women,
Law said, is seen most saliently in
the I981 welfare work require-
ments, in which women whose
youngest child is three years ol(l
may be required to seek employ-
ment and work without pay at a
work fair project.

“Presdient Reagan’s experience
with welfare reform is based solely
on his experiences as Governor of
California,” said Law. “In 1972

welfare recipients were required to 8

work without pay for public or pri-
vate organizations. .

“Reagan tells this story, ‘The
rolls were ‘reduced by 350,000 peo-
ple. They weren’t thrown off. they
just disappeared.’ ”

The idea, Law said, is to make
welfare so unpleasant that the peo-

ple Wlll liiid opportuiiities for
themselves. This is pure fabrica-
tion on Reaga,n's part, she said.

The final evaluation of the pro-
gram found it a failure in every
possibile nieastire with no reduc-
tion iii welfare cases or costs, said
Law.

The one impetus for the
improvement of women's eco-
nomic conditions has been the

individual woman seeking.

employment through traditionally
male channels, said Law. .

“To deny a talented and eager V

woman an opportunity simply
because she is a woman violates our
fundamental public committment
to individual equality. Denying
women opportunity -for work not
only hurts the individual woman
but also damages socially impor-

, tan.t enterprises, particularly cul-

turally rooted fields such as litera-
ture , sociology and anthropology.
Including women brings an
increase to the talent pool and
brings women’s unique perspec-
tives into focus," said Law.

Loyal readers of the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette and any
other Pittsburgher who cares about newspapers yyere
given quite a scare recently when members of the Post-
Ga:.ette’s writers’ union narrowly avoided a strike. The
fact that the newspaper might have been published with
less than full coverage of the city's news is indeed a shock-
ing thought, l)ut not as shocking as the overall trend of
failing newspapers in this country.‘

Altlmugh the subject of failing newspapers may not
have any perceived relevance to college students, the
thought that one might have failed———-even temporarily-
in our own city is cause for alarm on the part of anyone
who recognizes the role newspapers play in our society.

In a sense, the reporters represented by Local 61 of the
Post-Gazetle’s chapter of the Newspaper Guild were exer-
cising their own societal rights; the right to peacefully
assemble and correct what they assumed was an improper

“situation. The contract that was eventually negotiated
between the Guild and the newspaper’s management calls
for salary increases of $120. a week over three years, in
addition to a”j'ob security clause that requires layoffs of
stringers and part-time employees prior to economic
layoffs of Guild members. ‘

An appealing contract it might seem, especially if
you're one of manfylaid-off steel workers in thearea with
no contract to speak of. But if you’re a doctor, lawyer or
even a successful public relations executive, those kinds of
contractualyrewards are peanuts. » ' v.

Nevertheless, Pittsburgh was almost ready to face a
dearth of quality news reporting-——-in the morning at least.
On the other hand, it could l)e asked, what's the worst that
could happen if the Posl—(}azette reporters went "on
strike—no news fora week or two? Well, in fact, the-worst
that could happen is that the paper could have shut down
«permanently. No news if bad news, right? ‘
If a shut dovyn (lid occur, Pittsburgh might have joined
a growing number of American cities whose newspaper's
I front pages have resemble something like the inscriptions
on tombstones: the Phz'ladelpl1z'a Bulletin, the New York
Daily News “Tonight” edition and the Washingtrm Star.

There are other casualties in the trend of failing news-
papers: competing newspapers which been forced to
merge their non-editorial operations, similar to the Press ’ I
and the Post-Gazette, or their entire newspapers. Such

 E agreements, a results of government legislation, have been

arranged between the Allentown, Pa., Chronicle and Call,
the New Orleans Times-Picayune and States-Item, the
Topeka, Kan.',C-apital and Topeka Statejournal and the
Uniontown, Pa., Herald and Standard.

So, while it may have been unfortunate to see the Post-
Gazette walk out on strike, it would have been worse to see
the newspaperclose entirely. Some of the reasons for the
closing or failing of newspapers are attributed to the
impact of television, changing consumer habits and fewer
persons reading newspapers on the way home from work,
particularly afternoon newspapers or ‘i‘"p.m.’s.” Other
arguments are that newspapers aren't as good as they once
were. The latter argument, it would seem to us, is simply
I,  , not true; newspapers have actually increased in quality as
 a part of their attempt to fight declining circulations and

revenues. It's the same principle any profit-making busi-
ness would apply when faced with similar circumstances.

Perhaps the best argument, especially in the case of
college students, is that what is contained in newspapers is
not relevant any more to what concerns students. In the
late '60s and early 705, events such as the conflict in El
Salvador, Three Mile Island and cuts in social programs
other than student aid were seen as directly impacting
upon students’ lives. Today, however, as full-page adver-
tisements for soap operas are published in campus news-
papers and students are increasingly concerned about
their careers and their personal problems, there is less of a.
need to be concerned with what ‘is happening in other
countries or even in our own state capitol.

No one is going to force a student, or anyone else, to read
a newspaper. Newspapers, like anything else in a society
that places such a high value upon freedom of speech, are a
natural outgrowth of a legitimate democracy. They'll be
here, albeit in fewer numbers, until our freedom speech is
forfeited.

Dear Editor:

Margaret Attwood’s March 5
article, “Retention Committee
Studies Why Some Students Quit
School,” is an understatement of_
the inefficiency of certain adminis-
trative departments at Pitt. One
outstanding‘example is the cross-
registration department. In 1981, I
decided I would like to take a par-
ticular course offered at Carnegie-
Mellon University in the 1981 fall
term. That decision was the begin-
ning of a futile wild goose chase,
that unbelievably enough, is not

over yet. Toward the end of winter ‘

term, I inquired at the regismition
department as to the cross-
registration process. I was
that the Pittsburgh
Council for Higher Education
(PCHE) forms were not in yet, but
that they would arrive about mid-
July and, until I filled out the form,
I couldn’t register for the course. I
explained that I wouldn't be in
town then and asked if they could
send me a form if I forwarded them
a summer address. They agreed and
wrote down the names and
addresses of where to write. In
August I wrote them, and whenl
finally received my PCHE form, I
proceeded to fill it out and return
it. e

In September, after I had regis-

tered, I went to my first class at‘

(IMU and discovered that I was not
yet on the‘instructor’s enrollment
list. I assured him my name would
appear within a few weeks when
the registration red tape settled.
When a few weeks came and went
and both the instructor and I were
gettingga bit anxious, I called the
cross-registration department. I
asked why they hadn't notified
CMU of my enrollment yet. They
responded that they
received my PCHE form. Mildly
annoyed, I waited on “hold" for
some time before someonein that
department finally found it. They
informed ine that I had not been
‘accepted, as the class was full. This
seemed even more unusual as I had
made bountiful calls to the CMU
instructors last May, and they had
assured me of plenty of room in the
class. I asked why she had not
called to inform tne of this, as she
had previouslypromised to call me

when a-ll the forms_‘c,ame'j in from-

(EMU. -This same secretary then
denied hayingjsaid that.

Back to CMU I went, gettirig the
required forms of acceptance with _

the instructor's signature (he
denied haying eyersaid the class
was full), the department secre-
tary's signature and just about
everybody els'e's signature at CMU.
I was then sent to another office
and another secretary who called
Pitt's registration office (right in
front of me) and informed that
same secretary that they would be
forwarding the appropriate forms
shortly and that the student was
granted admission to the classby
(EMU. When she hung up. I

had never a

Cross Registered i S R pe

l

thanked her and told her I would
call Pitt again later and make sure
they had gotten the message. The
secretary naively assured me that
there was no need to recheck. Three
weeks before the course terminated,
I had a moment of nervousness and
called Pitt to make sure everything
was running smoothly. The secre-
tary took my name and put me on
hold. She returned to state that Pitt
had turned down my request to
cross-register at CMU.

When I regained my composure,

~ .I managed to ask; “Why?” She re-

plied that I had applied to Pitt too
late.'Hah, hah. ‘
In order to “late-add" a class, I
was to write an explanation (drip-
ping with apologies, I presume) of
why I was negligent enough to
have missed the “Add-Drop” dead-
line. And then, supposedly, a
btmch of “red tape" heads would
have a meeting and decide whether
I was deserving of their blessing.
Against every grain in my body, I
wrote the lousy letter and _delivered
it by hand. After that I called every
other day to make sure theyhhadn’t
“misplaced" it. Finally when I
called (with about five days of class
left), “the man" himself got on the
phone and explained to me that he
knew the whole mess was not only
my fault, it was the fault ofPitt and
the CMU secretary as well. At first
he claimed the CMU secretary had
never called. So "giving me a very
generous “benefit of the doubt,"
they would let me have the three
credits for a ‘tnerg$25 late fee.
After a good’ many issues had
been debated (I was ready to sug-
gest that since it was mine and the
two secretarys' faults, why didn't
we just split the charge three

' ways...). he came tip with the only

excuse (from tnttltitudes) that was

’ legitimate (though shallow, in my

opinion): I shouldn't have done
any of the cross-registration proc-
ess by mail.

;~.,- A

Eventually, I thought to myself
that we'd probably both had a long
term and, since I wasn't getting
anywhere using logic with him, I’d
better how my head and agree to
send in the money (he said they’d
bill me through the mail) before he
changed his little mind about the

A credits. But after my heated protes-

tations, he obviously did not trust
me to pay up (and this actually may

such a thing in that office) because
for the first time through all of the
four months of this chaos, THEY
called ME! They informed me I
would have to come down person-
ally and pay up or I_wouldn’t get
the credits. Well, I did and it still
took a long time to get any notifica-
tion to me or CMU of the credits
being granted.

What a nightmare! But sure
enough, when I went to my adviser
this monih to register for next
term, there were three credits miss-
ing from last term’s transcripts, ’

In this letter, I have omitted all

4 the other bureaucratic nonsense I

went through last .term: mistaken
bills sent, mistaken late fees, lost
forms, etc., etc., etc.) The Provost”s
Retention Committee (PRC)-
found that many students are drop-
ping out because of administrative
confusion, and I can understand
why. Unfortunately, as Fred Koloc
(of the CAS advising center) was
quoted as saying, “I don't think the
committee has come up with any
ideas that the administration has

 

' be standard procedure, if there 

-«I

paid any attention to." (At least the ,

administration is unbiased——they
ignore everyone equally.)-

If what Mr. Koloc says about the
PRC is true, it is too bad that what
seems to be a worthy service has not
progressed. Obviously, there is a
need for it when _ students are
stepped on.

. This exercise is designed to help

‘ you reduce stress by learning how

to recognize and decrease the ten-
sion that occurs in your muscles.
Follow the sequence outlined
below, repeating“ each exercise five
times and holding the tension for 5
seconds.

I. Assume relaxed position, prefera-
bly on the floor, legs turned out-
ward. You can also do these
exercises while sitting in a chair.

II. Concentrate on Diaphragm

Breathing. Get into the habit of
breathing in during muscular con-

traction and out during relaxation.
III. Start relaxing your lower extrem-
ities first, working up to your head,
neck and face.

Lower Extremities:

1. Pull your feet towards the front of
your legs, as if you were taking your
foot off the gaspedal. Next, push
feet towards the floor.

2. Push knees and hips into the
ﬂoor/mat.

3. Arch your back. This is a good
exercise if you have lower back

' pain, not related to an accident or

deformity. '
4. Pull in stomach muscles, keeping

ings of relaxation and tension.

straight and turned inward.
_7. Press palms into the sides of your
hips, keeping arms straight.

Shoulders, Neck, Head

8..Try to touch shoulders to your
earlobes. If you have chronic neck
problems, do this exercise carefully.
9. Chin to chest.

10. Head toward backbone.

11. If sitting, rotate head right, then
left.

12. Clench teeth and smile with
facial muscles tightened. -

Initially, -. these exercises may
make you feel as if you are ready to
fall asleep. As you become better
with this technique, you will feel
rested and more alert.

If you experience pain or spasms
during these muscular contractions,
stop and rest, then gradually
increase the tension over the next

few weeks. If pain persists, stopithel

Progressive Muscle Relaxa

The following is a student’s expe-

rience at a Progressive Relaxation.

workshop and a Biofeedback
workshop.
I had been running around cam-

M pus all day. Of course, I had a million

things to do, but now I was sitting in
an extremely stuffy room. I ended
up somewhere on the first floor of
the Student Union sitting in a small
room gawking at the other people
across from me. “What am I doing
here?” I thoughtas I looked around
the room.

Just then, a_ young man walked
into the room and headed toward
the front. He was casually dressed in
blue jeans and a purple sweater.
“ here’s the speaker? Could this
man be him?” I thought.

“This is the Progressive Body
Relaxation workshop,” said the
blue -jean'ed man. He asked the class
to clear the tables and chairs from
the center of the room. “Now, ev;
erybody find a spot on the floor and
lie down,” he said.

“What!? Lie down? What's going
on here?” I thought. Ilooked around

The term is coming to an end.,

finals are approaching, you have

three papers due and you still
haven’t found an apartment for next
year——no vyoiider you’re experienc-
ing signs of stress. Because the pres-
sures of’ everyday life can play havoc
with your physical and emotional
health, it is important to recogniz

the symptoms of stress. I

According to Anita Caufield, a
Graduate Student Assistant at the
Pitt Wellness Resource Center,
some symptoms of stress are: head-
aches, dizziness, grinding of the
teeth, stuttering, depression, exces-
sive snacking, nagging, nausea,
fatigue, inability to sleep and loss of
apetite.

“With most of the college people
I’ve known, their problems relate
either to indigestion or headaches
caused by stress,” said Caufield. “A
more recent problem I’ve been hear-
ing a lot of is financial worries—
everyone is worrying about the
cutbacks next year and how they’re
going to cope with them.”

Problems also arise from the fam-
ily, boyfriend and girlfriend worries
and peer pressure, along with aca-
demic problems, according to
Caufield. ‘

But what exactly is stress?

Stress is your body’s physical,
mental and chemical reactions to
circumstances that frighten, excite,
confuse, endanger or irritate you.
Some stress reactions are so
subdued they may not be apparent.
Others show themselves clearly,

ages moving toward the floor. “Well,

why not? Maybe I’ll feel better,” I ~

thought.

I squatted on the orange and
brown carpeted floor. My body felt
tense, and I knew that I needed this
relaxation method.

The room became mysteriously-
quiet, and suddenly, I found myself

following the directions of the

instructor. Faintly, I could hear a
sniffle from one of the girls in the
room and a bus roaring by from
nearby Forbes Avenue, but the

‘ more I relaxed, the more I blotted

out the outside world.

In slow, gentle tones, the instruc-
tor began. “Now that you are in your
area of darkess, think of your favor-
ite place. Picture yourself in that
favorite place. Now, concentrate all
that stress toward your feet. Tense
them up, then release all the stres
that is in them.” a

The instructor began with the feet
then went to the calves, the thighs,
and continued to reach each area of
the body. lfelt a unique kind of tingle

such as sweaty palms, heavy breath-
ing and a racing heart, according to
a publication put out by Blue Cross
and Blue Shield.

“Stress is . happening everyday
and it can be good or bad,” said
Caufield. ‘‘If you’re excited about
something. stress can be good to
motivate you. If you’re the type who
can work well under pressure,
stress can be good in that way. It all
reverts back to the fight or ﬂight
principle.” ‘

The fight or ﬂight response takes
place when you feel threatened.
Your body responds by preparing
you to fight the threat or to run away
from it. This system worked well for
prehistoric people, who many times
were threatened by forest fires,
animals and bad weather and it
sometimes works well for people
today who are in stressful situations.

Today, our dangers more often
tend to be deadlines, arguments and
boredom. In these cases, the body
cannot physically fight boredom or
run away from a deadline. The body
is “charged up” with no way to chan-
nel all of that energy.

“If the body is not given relief from
the biochemical changes that occur
during the fight or flight response,
chronic stress may result,” said
Caufield. “When you’re already
stressed and more stress is added,

the regulatory cener of the brain will T

tend to overreact. This causes we ,

and tear on the body and potential
breakdown of the organs and organ
systems whi'ch can lead to coronary

each section was relaxed, my body
felt a little lighter as I released my
stored up tensions. ‘

“Fill your lungs with as muchair
as you can, then let it go,” continued
the instructor. “Feel.the relaxation

lower body.”

By this time, I was feeling very
relaxed, and I just wanted to stay
like this forever. The instructor con-
tinued to work up to the neck and
head. He slowly began to finish the
relaxation method and the tone of
his voice kept me in the aura of the
whole experience.

Then I heard his voice. “When
you’re ready, open your eyes and
slowly sit up.” Peacefully, lfollowed
his command.

It took a few seconds to realize
that I was in that room in the Stu-
dent Union. Then, the instructor
asked the participants how we felt.

“I feel relaxed,” one girl said
timidly.

The others looked around the
room and began

bypasses and stomach ulcers.”

According to Caufield, some peo-
ple are more prone to stress than
others. These people are referred to

have Type B behavior.

“If you’re Type A, that means that
you’re more prone to stress, more
prone tgmheart attacks and (_ar_e_) a
competitive person,” said Caufield.
“A lot of students in college right
now are competitive students.”

Type B people are more laid back

and have a decreased tendency‘

toward problems related to stress.

they can't be, it is possible to reduce

‘the effect stress has on us.

the effects of stress can be lessened.

Muscle Relaxation Exercises cant

help students become more aware
of their tensions caused by stress,
and help to get rid of them. (See
Progressive Muscle Relaxation And

0 The effects of stress can also be
lessened if you have a (healthy atti-

tude. Being able to relax and com-,

municate effectively can help your
attitude. ,

0 Try not to overschedule your
life. Leave time to enjoy yourself.

0 Avoid getting into ruts.

.0 Don’t cut yourself off from other
people.

0 Believe in yourself. If you think
things are hopeless, they will be, but
if you believe that you can reduce
stress in your life, you can.

0 Don’t use tranquilizers to
reduce stress. Recent studies show
that Valium,‘a popular tranquilizer,
actually lowers concentration,
decreases reading skills, and makes
manual tasks harder.

“Are there any questions?” quer-
ied the instructor. Almost everyone
seem satisfied, but a few, people

, I‘ asked questions. .
Later, I learned the instructor’s

- ‘name. He was Steve Andrew, a
‘..""t:ounselor-intern at the Counseling

Center located in room 205 of the
Student Union. ’

“There’s no one right way you can
use to relax,” Andrew said. “Basi-
cally, you should use what is good
for you.”

As the people began leaving, he
announced that another method of
relaxation would take place in the
same room in a few minutes. I
decided to stay and see how the
other method worked.

A pretty, red-haired girl walked in
and introduced herself to the people
who had stayed and the others who

/, had joined us.

-’*’“My name is Anita-Caufield. I’m

       

from the Wellness Resource Cen-
ter. This is the Biofeedback
workshop.”

After a few words on stress, she
distributed small finger thermo-
meters to the participants. She

instructed us to attach the ther-

mometer to our middle finger with a
piece of cellophane tape. After eve-
ryone had finished, we lay on the

flqor. , _
Now, Im going to read some

phrases, and at the end, we will
check the reading on the thermome-
ters,” Caufield said. “If your reading
goes up, you have ‘released some
stress.”

I settled in my spot and focused

on her pleasant voice. She began
reading each phrase.
I “I’m beginning to feel quite
relaxed,” Caufield said and paused
for ten seconds. “My feet, my ankles
and hips -feel relaxed and
comfortable.”

With each phrase, I began to fall
into a relaxed state. “I wish that I
could be calm like this all the time,”I

th(Sllg}v‘xlly, Caufield continued

through a list of phrases. After she
finished, she told the participants to
sit up at their own pace.

After this command, I opened my
eyes and gazed up at the ceiling. I
felt as if I were in an empty 1'00“)-

ing in the background. This does
relax you,” I thought. “The poor guy
fell asleep.” _

Slowly, I sat up, and almost every-
one did the same. Caufield asked
the participants to ‘check their
temperatures. “Did your readings
go up?” she asked. '

“Mine went up five degrees,”
claimed a young man sitting behind

me.
I looked at my thermometer and
saw that my temperature had
increased a few degrees.
Caufield thanked us all for partici-

pating and walked to the front of the
room. .

The others collected their belong-
ings and left the room very calmly.

Whenever you encounter a stressful situation and
wish to relax: check your breathing. If it is shallow,

indicating excessive tension, smile a big ‘smile inside-

and smile with the eyes; and suggestto‘ yourself, “I
can leave my body out of this.” Then, take an easy,
deep breath and on the outbreath, let the body go
totally limp, imagine feelings of heaviness and

reaching your toes at about the same time you have
finally let the breath out. Then carry on your normal

PSU Routs Pitt Netters;
Dieffenbach ‘Still Optimistic

By scorr DELLETT

Despite being blanked 9-0 by
Penn State yesterday, Pityt Panther
tennis coach George Diiiékfenbach
saw some good things from his
team.

“Every match has a positive out-
come," Dieffenbach said. “Penn
State always has a strong team, but
I expected to win some of the
matches. All the matches were
close, and we almost won’ some.”

Dieffenbach mentioned that
Pitt’s top seed, James McDonald,
and fourth seed, D.J. Mariano,
came close to winning their singles
matches. McDonald had two set
points on Penn State's Bill Schil-
lings, but the Nitanny Lion senior

recovered to take the first set 7-5
and went on to take the next set and
match 6-4. Mariano played two
close sets against Rog Pinckham,
but Pinckham won both 6-4, 6-3.

“Jamie was outstanding against
Bill Schillings, who is a fine
player, and D]. played some good
aggressive tennis. He is really com-
ing along,” Dieffenbach said.

But the rest of the matches wer-
en't as close. Second seed Larry
Lederer was defeated in straight
sets by Virgil Christian 6-1, 6-1.
Tom Beckhard took Pitt’s third
seed Steve Berkovitz 6-1, 6-2, Jeff
Factor and Bill Rilardi beat Lance

Falce and Jay Petras by 6-2, 6-0 "and

6-0, 6-2 scores respectively. In an
exhibition singles match, Penn

State's Jon Whiteside defeated
‘‘ Mark Cohen 6-2, 6-4.

In doubles, Pilardi and Beckhard
defeated McDonald and Lederer 6-
2, 6-3, Factor and Whiteside routed
Berkovitz and Mariano 6-0, 6-1 and
Ashok Krishwaswami teamed up
with Cohen to end the match with
a 6-4, 6-2 loss to Schillings and
Pinckham.

Though the team took a beating
from the Nittanny Lions, Dieffenb-
ach believes the match could be
beneficial for his young squad.

“Penn State is always a strong
team, and I hope this can be con-
verted into a learning experience,”

Lewis Counting On Hitters

By J01-INETTE HOWARD

With an imposing schedule of

~ ‘”fi“vE‘“g”aimes within the next three

days, the Pitt baseball team offers
as resistance nine poised bats and a
crew of freshman pitchers whose
main strength, considering the
situation, may be naivete.

The team's regular season begins
tomorrow——weather permitting-—
with adoubleheader against league
foe Duquesne, followed by Town-
son State on Friday and a double-
header Saturday against another
league team, West Virginia. Fri-
day's game against Townson State
starts at 2:30 p.m. at Pitt’s Trees
Field.

In all three cases, Pitt Coach
Bobby Lewis is hoping dearly for
an explosion from the Panther bats
to cover up whatever pitching
shortcomings his inexperienced
staff throws up in the early going.

“It should be quite an experience
for them——jumping right into the

-fire like that. They're going to have
to go out and start against three
good teams,” Lewis said. “They're
going to have to mature very
quickly——li.ke overnight.”

Compounding the problems of
graduation, which stripped the
Panthers of two pitchers, and the
major league draft, which claimed
the team's other top two hurlers,
the lone returning starter from the

1981 team, Aaron Krause, has
developed arm trouble.

According to Lewis, Krause will

be examined today and may re-
quire surgery on the arm, which
would put him out for the entire
season. Krause, the team's top‘

returner with a 7-0 record last year, 4

has scar tissue in his elbow which
makes it painful for him to throw.
The sophomore did not throw at
all in fall practice and pitched only
three innings in the Panthers’ six
games at the Rollins College Base-
ball Week in Florida.

Despite the lengthy rest, Krause’s
elbow hasn't improved. The dearth
of starters may force Lewis to try
starting second baseman Mike Fitz-
patrick on the mound. Fitzpatrick,
a former pitcher in high school,
would probably be used in short
relief; he has been working out
with the pitchers as well as with the
infielders.

With the pitching situation so
uncertain, Lewis is counting on
strong hitting from his starting
lineup, an ability they showed fre-
quently in Florida. Though they
finished the week with an 0-6
record, the Panthers scored more
than 10 runs in several games.

Lewis admitted the Panthers are
anxious to start the regular season
after suffering through two cancel-
lations last week. Of the three

opponents they will face this week.
West Virginia, if the past season is
reliable predictor, will field the
strongest team.

The Mountaineers edged, Pitt
out by percentage points last year
for the Eastern Athletic Associa-
tion's Southern division title. The
two teams split the four games they
played last year, with each team
winning their two home games.

Although Lewis said he is not
familiar with WVU’s exact return-
ing team, he was heartened to see

to stop over in Pittsburgh on
my way to Buffalo" to get a feel
for Duquesne’s head coaching
job.

After all, Satalin, an under-
rated coach, was a true Bonnie.
He played guard there, he
coached there, his home was
there. It figured to take a lot to
change his residences, and it
figured to take a lot of
negotiating.

Well, a funny thing hap-
pened on the way to Buffalo.
Jim Satalin became the
Duquesne Dukes’ new basket-
ball coach. “I guess I made a
quickdecision," Satalin said.

Any coach would if a $20,000
pay hike were dangled in front
of his eyes and a basketball pro-
gram were handed over to him
alone. Satalin, no fool, jumped
at the chance.

“The opportunity was so per-
fect. There was no reason to dil-
lydally," he_said.

Satalin leaves behind a St.

won the NIT in 1977. He also
leaves behind some of the same
administrative struggles that
ousted Mike Rice at Duquesne.
Struggles that he will not have
to face on the Bluff.

One of Rice’s major beefs
while at Duquesne was the run-
ning of the basketball camp. He
wanted to run it. Red Manning,
athletic director, ran it, how-

»ever. Duquesne was one of only
two schools that had someone
other than its basketballcoach
to run its camp. The other was gt,

changed that, however.
Duquesne’s basketball camp is
his.

“If I mess up, i_t's my fault, no
one else’s. I'm in an ideal situa-
tion," Satalin said.

The situation is that Satalin
will have but Father Nesti to
answer to. That's it. The pro-
gram is his, the scheduling is
his, the job is his.

Mike Rice fought for changes
during his tenure at Duquesne.

I n jur '
A Pitt Panther spring football
opened Monday and

already the team has suffered its
first casualty.

Senior offensive.guard Paul
Dunn dislocated his elbow dur-
ing Monday’s practice and is
expected to miss the remainder
of the spring session. The
injury ocurred during contact
drill when Dunn, coming off a
block on a linebacker, fell to the
ground and another player
landed on his arm. The arm is
currently in a sling and should
keep Dunn out of action for tlie

 

next six weeks, at least.

The Panthers also lost a
chance at a potential addition
to their defensive backfield
when senior Darrell Gissen-
danner, who has played four
years of varsity basketball and
two years of varsity baseball,
turned down head coach Foge
Fazio’s invitation to tryout.

The 6-2, 185 pound Gissen-
danner’s size and speed, as well

as his excellent all-around’

athletic ability, apparently
attracted Fa7.io’s attention. Pre-
sumably Fazio was hoping

   

MarOp_ening Day

Gissendanner could add depth
at the defensive back position
and possibly progress far
enough to see spot duty as a
fifth defender in passing situa-
tions. Although he is a senior,
Gissendanner has one season of
football eligibility left if he
chooses to use it.

It is doubtful that Gissen—
danner, who did not play foot-
ball for (Ilarton High School,
could have won the starting cor-
nerback job vacated by Pappy
Thomas or beat out the Pan-
ther’s other experienced return-
ees in the defensive backfield.

The Pitt—Penn State rivalry
has been intense throughout
the years and has touched every
competitive sport. Volleyball is
no exception.

Today the Pitt men's volley-
ball team travels to State Col-'
lege to take on the nationally-
ranked. Eastern champion

‘Nittany Lions.

There won't be a Joe Paterno

' :1 “be PSU’s Tom Tait and

The Panthers have faced
Penn State tw_ice this season at
the Nittany Lion and Meadville
Invitationals. They lost to PSU
in the finals of the Nittany
Lion, 10-15 and 9-15. In the
Meadville Tournament, Pitt
had a two-game split with the
Lions, 7-15 and 17-15.

That split with PSU has
given the Panthers confidence
that they can beat the defending
Eastern champs, one of the Pitt

 perennial goals.

Tony Zortea. “We beat them

The Nittany Lions may be
one of the best teams in the
nation, but even the best have
their shortcomings. Reilly and
his spikers will be attacking
those soft spots. , '

“Penn State does have a few
weaknesses," said Reilly.
“They are weak serve receivers
and have areas of the court,
especially the deep corners, that
are weak."

With the recent loss of a Nit-
tany Lion player to ineligibil-
ity, the Panthers think they
have gained another advantage.

"It will definitely be a psy-
chological advantage for us,“
said All-East setter Dave Baird.
“And our split with them
helped, too. We know we can
beat them; it’s just a matter of
believing."

“Right now, Penn State’sjust
a little bit better than us," Zor-
tea said. “The game is going to
be really tough. We just can’t
break down."

Tony “Zort" Zortea has

~ ‘_ women's volleyball team, ninth-

” place ‘finisher .at the AIAW

    National Championships, won its

third United States Volleyball

Association tournament in as

~many tries this past weekend at
Trees Hall.

Pitt defeated a tough Eastern
Kentucky team in the finals of the
five-team tournament. Previously,
the Lady Panthers had won the I5-
team Cincinnati Invitational and a
l6-team tournament hosted by
Wright State in Dayton, Ohio. In
addition to the three-touriiament

. win streak, the Lady Panthers have
also reeled off 16 consecutive match
victories. - I . A 

All of this has made'Pitt  ( ch
Shelton Collier even more confi-
dent that Pitt can establish a solid

footing in the elite class of the
nation’s volleyball teams. In addi-
tion to the Lady Panthers’ Top l0

a finish at Nationals, the squad has
also bumpd off perennial power
Pepperdine, as well as highly
' _ regarded teams from Northwest-
ern, Ohio State, California-

“We proved during our colle-
giate (regular) season that we can
be nationally successful. Con-
tinued regional success is a high
priority as well. Our outstanding
accomplishments thus far in .{;,‘"°‘

vided additional notoriety and
excellent exposure for our pro-

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Over 60,000 basketball enthusi-
asts squeezed into the Louisiana

I Superdome last Saturday after-

noon and again on Monday night
tO_,_  ess the NCAA semifinals
an “finals, proving once again that
what began as an innocent form of
recreation for bored college stu-
dents has turned into big business
for profit-minded university
officials.

While ticket sales and a lucrative
television contract partially illus-
trate what the NCAA basketball
games have become, the large sums
of money paid to the tournament
participants——well over $1 million
to.those who successfully advance
to the Final Four—are even more
telling.

Considering that the money
earned by those who reach the

   

above the NFL minimum pay
scale, meaning that if the rumors
are accurate, some college players
are making more money than their
professional counterparts.
Interesting.

Here a question must be raised:
should college athletes receive pay-
ment for their services? The purists
who revere amateurism argue that
the appeal of collegiate sports-—
athletes competing for the sake of
competition itself——would be
forever lost, turning the game into
a mockery somewhat equivalent to
the NFL, with its emphasis on
playing for pay‘.

Well, it seems that ethics left
quite some time ago. It’s difficult
to call collegiate sports clean com-
petition when I7 of the 250 NCAA
member schools are currently on
probation, most for recruiting vio-
lations. No doubt this reflections
the fact that winning has for some,
surpassed competing as the sacred
rule.

And there was the case of Rich
Kuhn, the former Boston College

continued on page twenty-two

Fina‘ gpur is substantial enough to
paﬁsaﬁiﬁ? salaries of the entire
athletic department, the incentive
to build a big-time basketball pro-
gram has become an obsession to
the point that some will resort to
any tactic—legal or otherwise-to
reach the Promised Land.

It was only fitting, then, that
Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps,
whose team finished the season
with a 7-19 record, strutted into
New Orleans on the eve of the
semifinals and stole some of the
thunder. He told the conglomerate
of media types that some universi-
ties paid top-flight freshman pros-
pects for four years of service in the
form of season tickets, cash and
other untraceable enticements.

  us something we didn’t
ki‘{”w, Digger. What, you say that
some guards go for $10,000 a year?
Then those who suspect that some
top-notch collegiate football quar-
terbacks and running backs earn
$25,000 a year may be close to the
truth.

Besong, Smith Flooring It

To Nationals In Nebraska

By MIKE ROSE

Two Pitt gymnasts, Bob Besong
and Dave Smith, are leaving for
Lincoln, Nebraska, today to com-
pete in the NCAA National Gym-
nastics Championship.

The championship will take
place at the University of
Nebraska. It is a three-day event

which starts on Thursday and ends

with the finals on Saturday.
Besong and Smith will be partic-
ipating in the floor exercise. They
are-‘entering this competition with
thelfourth and fifth highest average

scores in the East. Besong isfourth
with an average score of 9.47.
The highest score that Besong
has gotten this year in the floor
exercise was a 9.75 and Smith's

highest score in the floor exercise ,0

this year was a 9.6—scores which
make both gymnasts contenders for
All-America“ honors. A
Both Besong and Smith will
have to repeat these high score per-
-formances if they expect to make it
to the finals on Saturday.
According to Pitt Gymnastic
coach Frank D‘AmicO, the compe-
tition this week will be very good.
“These are the best gymnasts in the

world because they are all special-
ists," D’Amico said.

D’Amico thinks that it is possi-
ble for Besong and Smith to make it
to the finals but he said that there is
no room for error. Only eight peo-
ple will make it to the finals.

Besong and Smith do not com-
pete Thursday but they will be
competing Friday in the optionals.
In the optionals, gymnasts are free
to do whatever they choose, in con-
trast to the compulsory exercises
which also go toward determining
the finalists. D'Amico said» that

there will beonly minor changes in '

both men's routines. '

basketball player recently found
guilty of charges that he shaved
points in some games. Kuhn was
bought out by some chalk
players—-more commonly called

.gam'b'lers--who needed 

insurance that A Boston College
wouldn't win by more than seven
points.

The mere fact that millions of
dollarsswere bet on the NCAA final
last Monday and that billions more
were risked on other events
throughout the year places colle-
giate sports in the same frame as
NFL sports. Sure, 98 percent of the
players and coaches are innocent,
but unfortunately the guilty 2 per-

, cent, along with the many outside

gamblers, dirty the idea of clean
competition.

It may sound farfetched, but why
not pay college athletes? After all,
their talents give a university pres-
tige, and in the case of the~Q'j;XA
basketball_ tournament and the
football bowl games, they bring the
school a considerable amount of
revenue.

Sure, the athletes are compen-
sated with an education, but for
some, if not many, this is worthless
since they concentrate more on
improving athletic skills than on
learning. ’

Simply put, an athlete spends
more time working on a 22-foot
jumper or a 40-yard field‘ goal, than
on logarithms or quadratic
equations.

Each university could set up a
committee to decide how much a
given athlete is worth, while the
NCAA
level. Players would receive pay-

checks and pay taxes like every-
- other university employee.

Naturally this isn’t a cure—all
solution that will completely get
rid of the riff-raff, but it might just
reduce the suspicions and bad
images associated with intercolle-
giate athletics. And stop the
charades.

“Both (Kohutiak and Zack) will

Collier is also crossing his fin-

to commit to Pitt, Gillespie is
another player who could fit right
into a major college team's starting
lineup. ‘ 

The 5-4 setter has led Norwin to
three co_n_secutive State champion-
ships and is still weighing her
choice of a college. According to
Collier, Gillespie, as well as several
of her teammates, are capable of
playing Division I volleyball right
away. “Norwin has one of the most
productive women’s high school
volleyball programs in the
nation,” Collier said.

For the Pitt squad already
assembled, there is one more
tournament——at Kent State next
weekend——before the USBVA
Championships in Cincinnati.

The USVBA is a “second sea-
son" which, according to Collier,
every collegiate team uses as part of
its year-round training program.
“It’s like a preseason for my team,
like spring is for football or fall is
for gymnastics, basketball or

Neighbor Baird
Influenced Zortea

continued from page twenty
Reilly thinks Zortea is now
jumping well above 40 inches.

“Zortea is a fine athlete,” said
Reilly. “His jumping ability is
amazing.”

“The best thing by far is my
jump and it really helps me on
offense,” said Zortea. “My knee
is almost back to normal, and
I’m almost jumping as high as I ._
was before I injured it.”

While he's blessed with a lot

, of natural talent, Zortea realizes
' he still has work to do on the

other technical aspects of his
game.

“It’s my defense that is weak.
In high school we really never
played defense. Everyone
wanted to ‘hit. There were no
real blockers,” Zortea
explained. “Then I came to Pitt
and found out how important
defense really is. Defense defi-
nitely wins games."

Zortea has a lot of time to
work on the intricates of the
game and Reilly is willing to
stick with the freshman in the
lineupwhile he learns.

“Zortea is a nice kid. He?s
extremely coachable and a plea-

sant kid to work with," Reilly
said. “By next year he should
have all the kinks worked out to
play good volleyball. Zortea's
going to be a fine volleyball
player for Pitt some day."
Similarly, Zortea has praises

:f0,rJhis new coach, for his

patience as well as his teaching.

“Ray (Reilly) has really
helped me,” said Zortea. ‘‘He’s
had a lot of confidence in me
when I wasn't playing well.
He’s giving me a lot of time
because he knows I can be bet-
ter. He is making me a better
player." ' ~ '

With his personal improve-
ment, Zortea says he is optimis-
tic that the Panther team will
also continue to improve.

‘‘I’m out to become a better
defensive player and a smarter

hitter—I want to learn to place
the ball better instead of just
smashing the ball,” Zortea said.
“In the next couple of years,
we’re going to be even better. I

, want us to be as respected as

Penn State and Rutgers-

Newark. I want them to have to

worry about beating_us.~”
Zortea Isa goods-start.

Tony Zortea credits next-door neighbor and teammate Dave Baird for some of his
improvement du-ring his first season at Pitt. ‘

an ornia State, the team that shut
out Pitt last year 9-0, today at Trees
Courts; and West Liberty, who the
Panthers defeated 5-4 last season,
tommorrow.

“I expec-t close wins in each

match,” Dieffenbach said. “My
goal is to win both matches by_a 5-4
margin which would get us back to
3-4. ,_
“We have to win the next two
matches to gain confidence," Dief—

very critical to the team.”
Dieffenbach believes his inexpe-

~ M We are progressing every day,"

Dieffenbach said. “The team has

shown much improvement."
However, three matches in as

many days puts an enormous phys- '

ical and emotional stress on the
team. Hitting a tennis ball for two
hours is comparable to a pitcher
throwng a nine~inning"game. Also,
‘it’s almost impossible for anyone
1 to.maintain' aconstant high inten-
sity for this long a time period.
