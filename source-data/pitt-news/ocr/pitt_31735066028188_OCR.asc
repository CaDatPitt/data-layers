line between

graffiti and art

Bill Bennett
For The Pitt News

What is art, and what is
vandalism?

That is the question sur-
rounding Matt Barrett, a 23-
year-old artist whose spray-
painted mural behind an
Oakland deli has recently
attracted the ire of Pittsburgh
zoning officials.

The city wants the com-
missioned mural painted over
because it fears the spray—paint
art will promote graffiti van-
dalism in the area. Barrett
draws a hard line between his
work and the scribbling of van-
dals.

Barrett's mural was com-
missioned by Emery Levick,
the owner of Kane’s Courtyard.
Now Levick, Barrett and his
cinder-block canvas are trying
to force the city to redefine the
difference between graffiti and
artistic freedom of expression.

On Thursday, Levick will
attend a hearing on the issue
with the city’s zoning board.
He said he hopes they will
grant him permission to keep
the mural.

If the city’s zoning board
refuses to grant him permission

to keep the mural as a sign with
a size-regulation variance, he
will face a $1,000-per—day ﬁne
until the mural is painted over.
The back wall of Kane’s
Courtyard, off South ‘Craig
Street, is splashed with spray-
painted fish, seaweed and an
inviting mermaid. There is no
nudity, profanity or obscene
behavior depicted in the mural,
but it apparently violates the
city’s law defining graffiti.
The problem is that the city
has no regulations for commis-
sioned spray-paint murals. So,
under the current standards,
Barrett’s underwater vision
falls somewhere between an

advertisement and vandalism.

But Barrett says permis-
sion is the difference between
graffiti and artwork. Barrett
deﬁnes graffiti as “paint or ink
applied to a surface without
permission.”

Barrett also believes that
the attention surrounding his
piece was simply caused by his
method of expression —— spray
paint.

“I could go around the city
with a bucket of paint and a
toothbrush and write my name
all over the place. Now that

Pitt student groups will have
easier time getting money

Lisa Di Renzo

‘ For The Pitt News

Hundreds of official student
groups can now obtain money for
their activities via the internet.

Student Government officials
say that since they put allocation
business forms on their website,
campus groups will be able to gath-
er a wealth of information during

the allocations process and they
will also save considerable time by
using this new service.

Instead of student delegates
picking up an allocations business
form in the Student Government
Board office of the William Pitt
Union and using a typewriter to fill
out the application, they can now

would be graffiti,” he said. “The mural
behind Kane’s Courtyard is a commis-
sioned work of art, but people see that it
was done with spray paint, so they think
it's graffiti.”

Levick agreed saying, “Someone
reported the wall through the city’s
anonymous graffiti-sighting hot line,
but all the building inspector had to do
was see the piece and know it is not
graffiti — it is art.”

Levick claims that the piece was
never inspected, and he believes he was
given the citation from the city bureau
of building inspection because his
restaurant is located in Oakland, where
graffiti is relatively common.

City Bureau Building Inspector
Dominic Cirnino claims the controver-
sy over the mural also applies to city
sign regulations.

“A sign can only be a maximum of
20 percent of a building, and the mural
[by Barrett] is about 40 percent.” He
also clariﬁed matters by saying that his
agency only enforces what the.zoning
administrator dictates. Cirnino admits
he has not even seen the mural.

City Zoning Administrator Jim
Brown said Pittsburgh’s planning
department is studying this case and
will make a recommendation to city
council regarding whether or not the
city’s building codes should be changed

to permit murals.

In Philadelphia, where Barrett used
to live, laws are already in place that
permit artwork like his.

Levick says that District
Councilman Dan Cohen is working for
legislation to ease the city’s mural reg-
ulations.

The Fate of Barrett's Ural is in the hands of cily zoning officials.

Levick adds that he’s ready to ﬁght.

“If I’m charged more than $30 a
year on the sign fee or if they make me
change the mural, I will take it to a
higher court,” Levick said. “I’ve hired
two attorneys who say this case could
be in the courts for three to ﬁve years

Campus reacts to the death of Princess Diana

Joy Drzewieoki
For The Pltt News

Regal in her stature while
humane at heart, Princess Diana's
death has shocked the world.

Her death has devastated mil-
lions, including several Pitt students
and facility.

Seconds after TV anchors stated
that Diana was in "grave condition"
late Saturday night, people began
reacting.

Dr. Ian Campbell, a Scottish
native and biology professor at Pitt,
was on his way to Delaware with his
son when he heard the news on the
radio.

"I was absolutely ﬂabbergasted
and in total bewilderment. What will
the world do without her?" said
Campbell. "Until ‘now, I don't think
the world knew how much she did.
She's a real powerhouse."

Kathleen Forsythe, a reception-
ist at the Semester at Sea office, got
the shocking news when she woke

up.

"I went to bed hearing that just
her arm was broken, so when I woke
up and found out she was dead, I
was terribly shocked," she said.

Many blamed the paparazzi for
Diana's death.

"I think it's disgusting and repul-
sive how tabloid reporters were fol-
lowing her. They didn't kill her, but

forced the situation," said Jason
Headen, a junior. "It makes me

aware of what journalists will do to

get their story."

Adam Maynard, a
senior, thinks her
death was a conspira-
cy.

“Who knows with
that damn Prince
Charles? Shame on the
paparazzi,” he said. “I
wouldn't be surprised
to A see unfolding
events in the near
future.”

Amy Peloso and
Tonya Hegamin, both
seniors who have stud-
ied in England, and
Elizabeth Moran, a
junior transfer student
from England, say
they can understand
the country's devasta-
tion.

"I think the English feel more
strongly towards the monarchy than
it appears. They love the queen and
they loved Diana," said Hegamin,
who lived in Lancaster for one
semester. "The royalties may sound
like a fairy tale to Americans, but to
[the British citizens], it is everyday
life. To my understanding, every-
thing in England has shut down for

their great loss.''

Moran, who lives in Stoke—on-

Trent, England, said Diana was a
glorious icon to
British society.
"Everyone adored
her. She made the
British feel proud. I
wouldn't say I adored
Diana, though. I was
more fascinated by
her," said Moran.
Peloso,’ who lived
down the street from
Buckingham Palace,
said Diana's death has
given her and every-
one else a reality
check.
"Everyone thinks
accidents happen to
everyone else but
themselves. So when
it happened to a per-
son like Diana, you
realize no one is invincible. Diana,
this magnetic, beautiful princess,
died in a car accident that could
have happened to a normal, average
person," said Peloso.

Many say the most tragic aspect
of her death is that it was alcohol-
related.

Henri Paul, the driver of
Princess Diana's limousine, had a
blood-alcohol level three times

France's legal limit while driving
Diana and her companion, Dodi
Fayed, home from Fayed's family-
owned Ritz Carlton.

"I am aghast that a bottle of wine
consumed in the last hour by the dri-
ver has killed the princess of Wales.
It completely overwhelms me, for it
was such a loss," said Campbell.

Forsythe said that the driver's
reckless speed of 121 mph and his
alcohol consumption makes Diana's
death more tragic. Sources say Paul
drank an equivalent of nine shots of
whiskey.

"I think Howard Stern said it
best that thank God that driver died
in the crash because his life would
have been over shortly afterthe peo-
ple got ahold of him," said Forsythe.

Some students say that even
though they are shocked by Diana's
death, it has not made much impact
in their everyday lives.

"Yes, I may be curious, but I
haven't given it much thought since
I'm not into the royalty life. The

entire world should not be
engrossed," said Jed Silberg, a
senior.

Freshman Sue Schonvisky is in
agreement with Silberg.
"Yes, when I first heard about

her death, I was shocked," said.

Schonvisky. "But as for me, it has no
impact."

Pitt custodians postpone strike vote two weeks

Thad Pawlowski & Harold Turner
The Pltt News

Pitt custodians who were
threatening to strike last week say
they will postpone their picket line
for at least another two weeks.

Local 29 of the AFL—CIO
planned to vote last week on
whether or not to strike. But, last
Friday, Pitt Personnel Manager
Alan Boggs met with union offi-
cials to negotiate a new contract for
the University's employees. That
was when the union decided to
postpone the vote until Sept. 16,
according to workers.

Those threatening to strike are
Pitt's janitors, groundskeepers and
maintenance engineers.

Their last contract expired Dec.
31, 1995, and union members have
been working since then under the
terms of their old contract, accord-
ing to Union President Billy
Jordan.

‘The union and the University
have agreed to extend this same
contract on a monthly basis,
according to Pitt spokesman..Ken

Service.
One custodian who asked that

his name not be used said the

University has been slow with the
negotiating process.
He also expressed
concerns that the new
contract would entail
cuts in benefits and a
signing bonus in place
of an annual percent-
age wage increase.

Boggs had no
comments about the
negotiating process on
Friday.

"We are confident
that both sides can
reach a fair and equi-
table agreement," said
Service.

Service said that
in April, Pitt offered
union members a 2-
percent raise increase,
but that contract was
overwhelmingly rejected by the
union. Service said the 2—percent
raise was a cost—of-living wage
increase...“ ..  

I A ¢ » . n

He said

The workers say they want an
unconditional 3-percent increase.
Jordan said Pitt's offer also
would have stripped Local 29 mem-
bers of their seniority
rights. That means
outside bidders could
have bid for their jobs
and have an equal
chance of getting
them when the con-
tract next expired.
The union members
marched last Tuesday
for new benefits and a
3-percent pay raise.
The workers who
marched last week
said they were
protesting unfair
treatment by the
University, and hand-
ed out ﬂyers that took
issue with a new

install in its stadium.
stated that if the

man critically iniures ex-wife

Across the Nation

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — A shooting
in a Miami Beach post office may
have been a case of domestic violence.

Police and witnesses say a postal
worker opened fire in the counter
area, critically wounding his ex-wife

and a friend as customers ﬂed in‘

panic.

A police spokesman says as soon
as the woman entered, the postal
worker went out back, came around
through the front door and opened
fire. I

The man later killed himself.

A co-worker identified him as
Antonio Tamayo, a clerk with 41
years‘ experience.

Hospital officials say both women
remain in critical condition.

BAYTOWN, Texas — A lightning
strike is blamed for a ﬁre today at an
Exxon reﬁnery in Baytown, Texas —
about 25 miles east of -Houston.

There are no reports of injuries.
The towering smoke could be seen for
miles.

Exxon spokesman Ron Embrey
said the ﬁre started late this afternoon
in a unit that separates oil from waste-
water. .

Baytown's Office of Emergency
Management confirms the Exxon
plant was hit by lightning as storms

blew through.
Officials say the fire will be
allowed to burn itself out.

CHICAGO — Researchers say when
it comes to giving shots, your doctor
needs better information.

A study in the Journal of the
American Medical Association says
more than 30,000 people die each year
because they were not vaccinated
against common diseases.

Doctors at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine say
they've developed a better way of
teaching doctors about when and to
whom shots should be given.

HRGAR, Bosnia —— Workers had to
descend into a cave in Bosnia yester-
day to remove corpses from one of the
largest mass graves there.

Up to 300 bodies, mostly Muslim
war victims, are thought to lie inside
the cave. Recovery workers removed
10 bodies yesterday, some with socks
and shoes dangling off decaying
limbs.

Workers described a horrible
scene, one made worse by the fact that
trash and barrels of acid were also in
the cave.

The U.N. War Crimes Tribunal
has been using evidence from mass
graves to build cases against suspects.

“Emery is the real hero,” said

A year ago, he painted the outside
of Stratus, an under-21 dance club on
Forbes Avenue. The spray—painted sign
took him two weeks to complete. Then,
on the last day of his work, city ofﬁcials
threatened the club’s owner with ﬁnes
of up to $1,000 a day for having graffi-
ti on the building.

Stratus had the mural painted over
the next day.

Despite his medium, Barrett said he
understands why some people object to
graffiti. “Pittsburgh is a working-class
city, where people bust their asses for
every brick on their walls, so they don’t
want some kid spray-painting their
property. The city doesn’t like my work
because they’re afraid it will promote
graffiti.”

Barrett admits that he learned his
trade by being an “undergroun ” graffi-
ti artist, but age and run-ins with the
law caused him to use his talents more
constructively.

“I’m not a graffiti artist, I’m a
spray-can muralist,” he insists.

not as good as real people

SGB Allocations has joined the ranks of computerized busi-
nesses and made some of their application materials available
online. Much of the University administrative paperwork is
available online already. Though none of this stuﬁ really saves
trees (you still haveto print outthe forms and deliver themto the
right oﬂices), it does make at least half of the process more con-
venient for sonre.

This newly-computerized world should stop seeming daunt-
ingandperilous.Itishightimethatweallstartusingthese
machines as more than gloriﬁed typewriters or high—tech paper-
weights. Computers really can take some elfort out of menial
taskssothatenergycanbeﬁeedupformoreproductivepur-
poses. They can make our lives better, if we use them conectly.

On the other hand, while electronic calculators can be help-
ful, they can also be “demons in a box,” as your 90-year-old
grandfathercallstherrLTheycantakethehurrranpartoutofbusi-
ness, or the personal part out of communicating.

There is no substitute for a wann smile and a ﬁrm hand-
shake. No matter how fast computers get, and even when every-
body has a 10-base-T intemet connection running directly to
their houses, speed is not going to make up for the hurrran com-
ponent of this world

Especially visible on Pitt’s campus, human interaction is the
most important thing we have. Just think about how much less
you’d learn if you spent all your days in a dorm room alone,
watching a lecture on a closed-circuit television and asking all
your questions via e-mail.

There is a richness in human contact that is the spice of life.
People are not going to do business if that richness isn’t there.
Already, most people seem to hang up immediately when they
hear that computerized recording that had the nerve to call them
and ask them to hold! That idea might have rrrade sense on the
drawing board, but chalk doesn’t get impatient. People do, and
only other people can deal with people correctly.

If you think we’re wrong, just wait until the ﬁrst time the
banks have gotten rid of tellers, anATM machine shorts you $20,

 there’s nobody around to whom you can complain. .

Many say one of the things you
lose when you come to college is
your religion.

In high school, I thought I just
misplaced mine for a little while. But
it was officially lost by the time I got
to college.

Luckily for me an people like
rrre, there are plenty of people out
there who have found religion,
ernbraceditandarewillingtoshareit
with everybody! They are willing to
stand on street comers and shout for
joy, “Hunay!! I’m religion-happy!!
Come join, my friends! !”

I, like others I’m sure, just roll
my eyes, giggle to myself and ignore
them. They can “shout for joy” all
they want, as long as they do not
bother me. (I am alluding to people

’ such as the guy who blabs for horns

on the comer of Bigelow and
Forbes.).

There are also the groups that
have managed to climb to the top
spot of my “shit list’ ’ by doing things
that I consider rude, devious, mis-
leading and dangerous, and they do
tlresetlringstoconvincemetobepart
of their groups.

Religion begins with faith.
Obtaining faith and keeping it should
not involve convincing someone to
believe. Any group or organization
thattakestothe streetstorecnritand
brainwash followers is based on lies
and deception.

If you have not yet been
approached by these groups, you
probably will be in the near future
becauseitistlrebeginning of theyear
and there is lots of new “prey” for
ﬂrem. They look for young and vul-
nerable people to befriend

Each group has its own way of

 

Keep your religion to

recruiting, but the most common and
thriving groups are the ones who use
deception to suck you in.

My favorite example of this is
my personal experience with one par-
ticular group over the past three
years. Agirl started chatting with rrre
on the busone day. The next time I
saw her, she introduced me to her
ﬁiends and invited me to go to a
“meetin ” with them. I felt very
uncomfortable and didn’t go back

Then, the phone calls came.
Almost everyday for two weeks,
someone ﬁom this group called my
house. I either left the phone off the
hook or didn’t answer.

I thought I was free and clear of
these people until last summer when
I was approached by some people
playing volleyball on the Cathedral
lawn. “Hey, you want to play?” they
asked

“Uhhh, no thanks. Ihaveto go to
work”

“Well, we’re here every
Wednesday night if you ever want to
come play! !”

At this point I made no connec-
tion. But, as I proceeded to walk past,
I noticed three girls from the meeting
I went to. ,

later that summer, I was stand-
ing at the bus stop when two girls
walked up to rrre with huge smiles on
their faces and introduced tlrem-
selves. Irnrnediately, I recognized
them. (You would think that they
would have left me alone by now.)

Before they got the chance to
continue, I sternly said, “I don’t
believe in God”

Instant frowns. They walked
away.

What have I learned? Don’t talk
to strangers. (This is sorrrething I
should have learned in preschool.)
You never know what or who people

THE PITT NEWS

yourself

I also know how corrupt some
of these groups are. They recruit
members in high school and ask
them to help recnrit more, which
sounds fairly innocent, until you see
them in Oakland on a Saturday night,
passing out ﬂyers. Just imagine a 17-
year-old kid, in a suit, passing out ﬂy-
ers around 11:30 p.rn. When I saw
this poor, brainwashed teenager, I had
to ask him why he was passing out
ﬂyers that nobody would read.

He said, “Because I believe in
spreading God’s word”

I didn’t know “God’s w ”
involved risking your safety!

Besides these two instances,
there have been countless other times
when strangers have walked up to me
and said things like:

°”Are you saved?” —

-”Have you accepted Jesus
Christ as your savior?”

-”I want God to be in YOUR
life, too! Let me help you.”

No, I am not saved. No, I
haven’t accepted Jesus Christ as any-
thing. No, I don’t need or want your
help.

leave me alone and let me ﬁnd
my own path.

Although it may not visibly
seem this way, I actually do have
tremendous respect for those who
have faith and a belief system. But
when it is plagued with deception and
ambiguous activities to lure people
in, I become cautious and, some-

Faith is not an animate object. It
cannot come to you. You can only
ﬁnd it yourself.

on her own soapbox in The Pitt

Princess Diana was a
hero and an idol for all

Hillary

Stevenson

The whole world held Diana in fasci-
nation. Even as a nation that sought to
escape the monarchy politically, we in the
United States are amazed by it socially. As
achild,Iwas drawntoDianabecauseofher
fame — the fancy balls, choosing which
Italian coutu1ier’s label to have in the back
of your clothes, being ﬂanked by everyone,
taking calls from celebrities the way we
commoners take calls from telemarketers,
vacationing in places that if you have to ask
how much it costs to go there you probably
can’t alford to, and at the end of the day
being able to call the queen of England
“mum.”

What young girl wouldn’t see that and
wish it could be her? I did. I wanted it so
much so that when the wedding of the cen-
tury was making news, I put copies of
Newsweek, Tme, and anything else that
bore the picture of Diana on its cover under
my pillow, just to make sure I would have
royal dreams. I even prayed for it My
mother had a bookmark with a prayer to
some saint who would grant your request
after reciting the prayer for a certain number
of days, and I would read this prayer every
night, believing that somehow a prince
would ﬁnd his way to a little Maryland
town and whisk me away to the mother

   

country.

I don’t recall what ﬁnally made me out-
grow this phase, but thankfully I did, to
some degree at least. My perspective
changed I started to admire individuals for
other things besides their jet-setting life-
style. But I always admired Diana.

I_ saw an inner beauty that radiated
through when the press would show her
dancing till dawn at a gala event. She had
poise in the presence of foreign dignitaries.
There was grace when she held a child
enduring AIDS, malnutrition or some other
horrible aﬁliction. Compassion drove her to
work for the things she believed in, includ-
ing most recently trying to rid Bosnia of
land mines. Finally, it was hard not to rec-
ognize the love in her eyes when the
paparazzi captured any moment of her with
her sons.

Diana did what I believe only most of
us spend our lives wishing to do: working
for what we believe is right, speaking what
wefeeltobethetruth,andinsomesmal1
way making this world a better place.

Maybe now the Queen of Hearts can
ﬁnally have the peace she craved, while the
rest of us look for another fairy tale to take
us away from our common lives.

The frenzy over Diana's
death is going on too long

Kris Kissel
Oplnlons Edltor

I did not admire Princess Diana,
nor any member of the British royal
family. I still don’t, because I don’t
think she is a very important person.

Sure, she did some good things. As
a public ﬁgure, she used her spotlight
in the media to spread her word, to ask
people to show compassion, to ask peo-
ple to make the world a better place.
But I think everybody I know would do
the same if they could. In fact, some of
us do, in our own little way, by writing
for this newspaper. The fact that she
had a larger audience was not her
doing, and I don’t think she deserves so
much attention now.

Frankly, I’ve gotten tired of hear-
ing about her, about what a great
tragedy her death was. It was tragic -
as tragic as many other accidental
deaths of a mother of two sons, though
perhaps not as tragic as some. I’m sure
that her sons will not go on a minimal
Social Security income now that she is
gone or end up stealing bread in order
to survive.

But no one talks about those stories
when they hear the ﬁve-second sound-
bite on the evening news. So why does
everybody seem so interested in this

     = 

particular incident? Barbara Walters
answered that question Sunday on tele-
vision when she was asked why the
world seemed so enamored of the
princess: “Because she was beautiful!”

I don’t mean to downplay the
tragedy of this incident. It was a
tragedy and is a horrible loss for the
world, as is any death of somebody
who tries to do some good for the
world. I just do not think it deserves so
much attention. We had a tribute to the
princess during halftime of the Steeler
game last Sunday; ongoing coverage
from the moment of the accident until
at least Monday morning, and I’m not
talking about FOX News — this was
CNN! Is there no real news going on in
the world?

It speaks pretty poorly of our soci-
ety that we place so much importance
on Princess Diana, and I don’t want
anybody to tell me that it’s not for pure-
ly superﬁcial, mindless reasons.

Nobody is going to be glued to
their television sets when Mother
Teresa passes on, and there will be no
ongoing coverage on CNN. It’s sad, but
it’s true. Just ask the paparazzi.

Pih‘ fans must
believe in the
impossible

On the advent of their most mean-
ingful football game in years, the Pitt
Panthers ﬁnd themselves staring down a
long list of apparent impossibilities.

This weekend, David (us) will meet
Goliath (the Penn State Nittany Lions) in
what surely will be a contrast of styles.

Pitt is hoping to go to Happy Valley,
wade through the mounds of cow
manure and RVs, and pull off one of the
biggest upsets in college football in the
last 10 years.

Penn State is trying to ﬂex its coun-
try—fed muscles and prove to the nation
that it deserves the lofty pre—season
expectations that college football gurus
have placed on it.

Pitt will be led by Walt Harris — a
man, who at 51, is entering just his sec-
ond game at the major-college level.
He’s 1-0, but 12-24 overall thanks to
three years at defense—poor Pacific.

On the other side, Penn State is
anchored by Joe Paterno, who has
coached over 350 games and has logged
289 wins (two of which have come
against reputed powerhouses Bowling
Green and Northern Illinois; the rest
came at the hands of lesser competition).

One final statistic to throw down
your throat: Pitt owns a less—than-stellar
12-32 record over the past four years and
has not had a winning season since 1991.
Penn State on the other hand, is 42-7
since 1993 and has played in a major
bowl game each year.

It looks pretty ominous for Pitt.

Right?

But sometimes you have to throw
out the gaudy numbers, the embarrass-
ing comparisons and the lofty point
spread. After all, this is Pitt vs. Penn
State, one of college football’s most sto-
ried and intriguing rivalries.

This is a series that has encom-
passed 93 confrontations with more than
its share of trash talking and bickering
about which team is better.

Despite all the looming inequalities
between the two teams, when the
Panthers and the Nittany Lions clash this
weekend, anything can happen.

With this in mind, I say let’s toss out
all the peripheral comparisons and focus
on the playing field.

Now, it would be foolish or even
downright idiotic of me to suggest that
Pitt is the better team, or even that it has
a solid chance of winning.

             

olleyball drops lw in Iy

Matt Grove
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Lady
Panthers volleyball team
opened up its 1997 sea-
son by dropping two non-
conference matches to
Clemson and Auburn.

Head Coach Cindy
Alvear is starting the sea-
son with a new look.
Unlike the past decade,
when the Lady Panthers
were anchored by
seniors, 1997 marks a
change in team chem-
istry.

Pittsburgh’s roster is
senior-free. Three
juniors, five sophomores
and four freshmen make
up the squad.

Pittsburgh fell
Saturday to Clemson,
who started three seniors
in four sets, 15-6, 8-15,
15-4 and 15-6.

“This is a first at Pitt,
this is the youngest team
we’ve ever had,” Alvear
said. “Our inexperience
hurt us in judgement, and
we were hurt at a couple
positions.”

The Lady Panthers
were led by sophomore

Paula Zemrowski, a 6-5

middle hitter from
Kalamazoo, Mich.
Zemrowski notched 17

kills in 38 total attempts.
Tara Haefner added 32
assists for Pittsburgh.

“It’s more of a chal-
lenge when there are no
seniors, but everyone
knows they need to step
up,” Zemrowski said.
“Most of the weekend,
we were waiting around
for someone to be the
leader. They [Clemson
and Auburn] were not
better ski1l—wise, but they
are more together now as
a team than we are.”

Pitt’s Marcia T hiesen
recorded 10 kills in three
games in her first colle-
giate match. The‘*19-year-
old freshman felt she was
prepared for her debut
but that the team needs to
work together more to
improve.

“There is a certain
amount of comfort when
you play with people for
a while, and we don’t
have that yet,” Thiesen
said. “We don’t really
know what to expect -yet
or who to depend on

doesn’t really coach us to

COLUMN

But what can be said is that Pitt is
making a solid effort to start this season
fresh, with a new athletics director, a
new coach and new colors.

Along with these additions, a new
attitude has also emerged. Hopefully,
it’ll last past the second game of the sea-
son.

All of these factors may not be
enough to conquer the big, bad Nittany
Lions. But what the hell, let’s go to State
College, have some fun and see what
happens.

improvement. Both the freshmen
and the upperclassmen have been
training and gaining experience
over the years. _

“Three years ago, our top
women were running in the low 19s
[minutes, for a five-kilometer
course],” Sobal said. “Now, [the
top women are] running in the low
18s. We expect everybody to be in
the low 19s by the end of the sea-
son. The standards have changed.”

The standards for the men have
changed, too. A time in the 27-
minute range for the five-mile
course used to be good enough to
make Pitt’s top seven. This year,
Coach Sobal made a fairly bold
prediction about the men’s team.

“It would be a stretch to say
we’ll have seven guys under 26
minutes, but we should be close,”
he said.

As for the older runners, most
of last year’s team members will be
back. Last season’s top runners -
Ed Adamson for the men and
Stephanie Ellsworth for the women
— are gone, but the packs that ran
behind them are back. Particularly
for the men, the lack of a definite
front-runner has fostered more of a
“team” mentality.

“We’re doing things as a group
that we couldn’t do last year,”
Sobal said. “We’re stronger up
front than we were. Scott Curry and
Matt Samuel won’t be lonely up
there.”

FROM PAGE 11

Actually, nobody on this team‘

seems to be lonely. This squad
looks more like a team than it has
in years.

“The men and women are a lot
tighter and working together more
this year,” said senior Lynda
Andros.

Fellow senior Curry agreed.

“The cohesion is there early.
We’re barely a week into the sea-
son. That’s going to pay off in the
long run,” Curry said.
