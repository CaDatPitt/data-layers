War, Militarism,
Scored At SFA
Peace Assembly

Crowd Fills Heinz House To Hear
Peace Advocates; Paciﬁsm
Urged In Open Forum

By Edwin Banks

Vvliile students pressed ten-deep in
front of Heinz House, unable to join
the 650 others who jammed every
available spot within the building, the
University’s ﬁrst voluntary peace as-
sembly, Friday morning from 11 to 12
o’clock, heard Dr. Bernard Clausen.
Dr. Elmer Graper, James Boyle, C35,
and several students in the “open"
forum denounce military preparedness
as instrumental in fostering war and
urge united action by college men
and women in building up an effective
pacifist movement.

Coming to the SFA sponsored assem-
bly after a talk before a simi1a.r group
on the Tech campus, Dr. Clausen, in
a strongly emotional address, empha-

A sized graphically the horrors of war

and condemned the stand of patriot-
eers who speak glibly of desiring
peace and at the same time call for
increased war preparations wb.i’cl1 only
intensify war spirit. The First. Bap-
tist church pastor pleaded that stu-
dents organize to spread the gospel of
peace all over the world.

Dr. Elmer Graper exploded with
quiet logic the arguments of jingoes
who have prevented the United States
from becoming a member of the
League of Nations. Attacking the for-
eign policy of America during the last
decade, the head of the political sci-
ence department advocated that the
nation take real steps toward disarm-_
ament and international cooperation
in the cause of peace.

As official student speaker at the
assembly, James Boyle, veteran cam-
pus debater, and president of the John
Marshall club, spoke eloquently for
pacifism. He ﬂayed the ﬂamboyant
journalism of the miltarist press and
the business methods of private muni-
tions makers and recommended the
abolishment of the ROTC. Boyle fa.-
vore-d the attitude of downright
paciﬁcism on the part of students;
that is, absolute non-participation in
any kind of war.

Engineers Make
Real Steel When
Lights Are Low

Long after most good University
students have left the campus, a
group of energetic engineers “turn
on the juice” of an electric furnace in
the School of Mines building, and be-
gin to make steel just as it is done
in the most modern and best steel-
ma‘-ting circles.

More than 50 pounds of scrap iron
are dumped into the ladle and turned
into steel by the terriﬁc heat of inch
and 2. half graphite electrodes as they
build up a. temperature of over 2800
clegrees -Fahrenheit. Due to the great
drain on the electric line of the Uni-
versity, the furnace can be used only
after most of the lights on the campus
are out. According to the head of the
Department of Metallurgy, Stephen L.
Goodale. the furnace consumes about
45.000 watts or enough current to light
1,000 light bulbs of ave1'3,.'-re size. Due
to the tremendous amount of current
used the furnace is operated only
from six to ten times a semester.
Last semester it was not used because
of defective equipment.

The furnace itself is a steel sphere,
about two feet in diameter, split hori-
zontally, and lined with silica to
withstand the heat. The two elec-
trodes entering the top are connected
to heavy cables that carry the elec-
tricity :rom a special current regulat-
ing device. The entire assembly is
mounted on a. brick base so that any
molten steel spilled will do little
damage.

 

ing Dr. Williams’ address, new mem-
bers will be tapped for Owens, wo-
men’s sophomore honorary activities
fraternity; Druids, 1nen’s sophomore
honorary activities fraternity; Xylon,
women’s honorary journalistic frater-
nity; Theta Alpha. Phi, honorary dra-
matic fraternity; -Scabbard and
Blade, honorary military fraternity;
Omicron Delta Kappa, men’s upper-
olass honorary activities fraternity;
and Mortar Board, senior women's
honorary activities fraternity.

The Senior Spoon, awarded annual-
ly by the senior class to an outstand-
ing junior man will then be presented
and the ten senior men and senior wo-
men chosen for the Owl’s Hall of
Fame will be announced.

A new award this year will be the
naming of the best all-round senior
man by Omicron Delta Kappa. The
last item on the program for Tap Day
morning will be the announcement of
the senior women elected by their
class at the recent women's elections
as Senior Queen and Alma Mater.

Turner Maintains
Reaclionary Few
Caused Dismissal

Blames “Little Men Downtown
Who Think They Please
The Big Men”

Dr. Ralph E. Turner took the
stand for almost four hours Sat-
urday to review his nine-year
career at the University for the
special House committee investi-
,g'ating academic freedom and to
charge his dismissal last June to
political and economic interests
hostile to the Pennsylvania Secur-
ity lieague, of which he was
chairman.

CD1’. Turner testiﬁed:

1. That in 1931 he “reduced” his
classroom discussion of the theory
of evolution to omit evidence and
present only the theory, in response
to a request by Dean Lee Paul Sieg,
who was quoted as saying that “in
many respects "Pittsburgh is a four-
teenth century community.”

2. That “in the last three years
I have no recollection of any admin-
istrative officer’s complaint against
my classroom methods,” whereas
two complaints were brought to his
attention about activities outside
class.

3. That “it was recognized by
the faculty that every man who
signed the Liberal Club petition was
a marked man,” and that every man
who signed has left. the University
for various reasons.

4. That in February, 1933, he ac-
cepted the chairmanship of a local
branch of the Pennsylvania Secur-
ity League—a.n organization inter-
ested in social legislation-—because,

-having ﬁnished -his recent biogra-
phy, and being without the mater-
ials for research in English history,
and lacking the instinct for “facul-
ty golf and faculty bridge," “time
was on my hands."

5. That he resigned from the
state chairmanship of: the Security
League following a conversation
with J, Steele Gcw, who told him
that “the University wants to know
whether you are going to follow a

scholarly career or a political
career.”
6. That thereafter he waived

connections with movements out-
side the University, “except such as
came to other faculty menibers.”

7. That his speech before the
Vlfestern Pennsylvania Historical
Society on the prescribed subject,
“Western «Pennsylvania l—listory in
the Making,” was “the last straw”
to irritate local interests.

8. ‘That the explanation Chancel-
lor Bowman gave of the dismissal
was: ‘‘It is not political." And:
“The Board of Trustees is a group of
business men, and among them
there is a great deal of discontent.”

Quotes Former Dean

Dr. Turner told of a conversation
with Dean Sieg, now president of the
University of Washington, following
the June dismissal, in which Dean
Sieg blamed “the little men downtown
who think they are pleasing the big
men.”

In response to invitation from Rep-
resentative Eugene A. Caputo, Dr.
Turner then launched into a descrip-
tion of the rights of a university pro-
fessor. There are two, he said, in-
cluding the rights of academic free-
dom-. and the rights of citizenship.

“The man who enters the academic
profession undertakes the obligations
of a guild which demands from him
at all times the highest standards of
information available,” he said.

“It is utterly impossible for the pub-
lic~—the normal American mind——to
impose a censorship upon the judg-
ments of experts and specialists.”

“No institution.” he concluded, “is
greater than a free maan’s right of
citizenship. The right of citizenship
includes the right to take part in any
question that is alive; and the acad-
emic man, provided with superior in-
formation, is very deﬁnitely abdicat-
ing his obligation to democracy if he
keeps his conclusions to himself.”

Cross-Examined by Arensberg

In cross-examination, Attorney C, F‘,
C. Arensberg asked Dr, Turner to
identify a summary of a speech he
gave “on the negative aspects of re-
ligion” before a YVVCA meeting some
time  The. summary was admit-
ted to the record.

Arensberg asked ,Dr. Turner a ser-
ies of questions. in which he declared
he \l‘«"rl-is “o1‘eom‘iug the ground for fur-
ther testimony.” as follows:

“Did you ever a.t any time in class
My that if a child is brought to me
before he is 18 I can strip him of his
religion?”

‘ENO.

“Did you ever say that you were an
agnostic?”

“I have said that I am an agnostic,
yes."

“Did you ever compare baptism to
a hog-wallow?”

Pitt Salvo Maintains
‘War Is Inevitable’

“The membership of Scabbard and
Blade is sincere in its desire for

world peace "and the elimination of
war,” said H. O. Husband in the
Pitt Salvo, which appeared on cam-
pus Friday, from the Scabbard and
Blade Journal’s answer to the Liter-
ary Digest recent peace poll,

Husband's article continued: “VVa.r
is unceasing on the face of the
globedue to the inherent defects of
human nature, and until such cancer-
ous spots are removed by understand-
ing and education, the peoples of the
earth will know war.”

Among other things, the Salvo in-
cludes articles on «the presentation
of the activities award, by the Salvo,
to Don Campbell, ‘C35; ROTC’s ﬁne
record in the recent National ride
meet; plans for the Corps part in
Spring Festival week; the recent suc-
cess of the Band in its concert at
Peabodv .High school.

BA, Alfred Dixon, E, Robert Kauf-
man, C, and Richard Lewis,  and
one junior woman, Jane Booth, Ed,
were not listed for re-election.

Leonard Marks, chairman of the Ex-
ecutive committee, commenting on
the selection, declared that the time
and willingness of individuals to serve,
to the best interests of the Assembly
were taken into consideration.

‘There was no attempt to allocate
ihe nominees by schools.” said Marks,
“but we believe each one will have a
fair representation.” According to
schools, the College has 37 nominees,
Education, 9, Engineering, 5, Dentist-
ry, 2, and Business Administration, 7.

Another factor taken into considera-
tion by the committee was theshort.
period between release of nominees
and time of election. On the matter
of campus politics, Marks stated, “I
sincerely hope there will be nothing but
a straight and fair election. I be-
lieve We have picked the finest possi-
ble group out of the University to run
for the Assembly and I think they
will be above petty politics.”

The Spring election will mark the
ﬁrst campus-wide use of signature
cards made possible by the Regis-
trar's office. These cards. ﬁlled out
at second semester registration, will
be checked against handwriting of
voters to avoid ballot “stuffing.”

Besides Marks, the Executive com-
mittee includes: Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women; Dr. Vincent
W. Lanfear. dean of men; Theodore
W. Biddle. assistant dean of men and
1‘€*D1‘esentative of the Chancellor:
170113161 Canlpbell. ‘C35. Jules Green,
‘C35, Charles Herald, C36, and George
Roll, Ed35. Mary Gertrude fl-Ierron,
E-'d35, and Hazel Lincoln, Ed35, sat
with the committee as non-voting ex-
officio members representing Senior
Court in the selection of women.

Dr. Garth Will Conduct
Final Worship Service

Dr. Schuyler E. Garth of Christ
Methodist Episcopal church will be
the third and ﬁnal speaker at the pre-
Easter worship, service series at

“Modern sepulchres and Christ” is

According to Kenneth McCracken,

for this particular meeting, a sextet
from the Women’s Glee club will sing
a number of songs. Edward Breth-

‘And Why Attend Peace Assembly?’
Students Offer Answers, Comments

By Ruth Sochatoff

_On Friday at 10:5-5 o'clock, a Pitt
Ix‘-e\v.c: reporter vs.-is placed at the
Fiftli avenue ent1'z‘.nce of the Cathe-
dral to ask The students as they came
out why or why not they were attend-
ing the Peace Assembly at Heinz
House.

The: reporter found that the major-
ity of students walking out wanted
sincerely to protest against war, and
were not demonstrating for the sake
of leaving classes. Three out of five
students accosted were attending the
assemblv for one reason or another.
and those not attending were mainly
indifferent, very few of them having
cleﬂnite reasons for staying away.

Lieutenant Donald C. Tredennick
answered the qucs-‘ion. “lVhy are you
attending‘."" bv half-turning and call-
ing back. “Wl1v‘? Why do you think'.’
Because I'm against war!”

Some of the answers other than.
“Because I want peace,” are as fol-
lows:

“I want to live to be 100.”

“Demonstrations are ineffective, for

those in power can manipulate a war
if they want to, but l’n1 just going up
there to show where my sentiments
are.”

“'.l‘his is the ﬁrst step to Utopia.”

“I feel we should cooperate with all
the other colleges in this movement
and maybe something can be done.”

“My mother di-dn’t raise me to be a
soldier.”

“Just curious to see what they‘re
going to do about it.”

And some of the replies given by
students not climbing the hill, were
these:

“'We should let sleeping dogs lie.
This propaganda meeting only stirs
people up and makes them war-con-
scinus.”

“I’m quite sure the organization
starting this is the same group that
causes the student body to be brand-
ed as communists. This meeting is
a son!”

“I’ve got too many important things
to do.”

“What do you think I am—a com-
munist?” -

Condemns NSL
Editor, Pitt News:

To me, it is very unfortunate that
a. pack of meddlers defeated the sin-
cere attempts of persons like your-
self and the members of the peace
meeting assembly to implant in the
sensible college student an abhor-
rcnce of war.

As might be expected the members
of the National Student League
sneakingly passed out handbills in
their usual skunky denunciation of
any Americanism. Their invitation
to “strike” (they can’t conceive of
any peace movement without a rab-
bling demonstration) as a protest
against everything American makes
it impossible for me to participate in
spite of the invitations of the more

balanced, as I consider myself a “pa-
triot.”

Therefore, I cannot permit myself
to attend meetings, for which the re-
sponsibility is claimed by Commun-
ists whose main object behind their
peaceful front is to insure their be-
ing able to gain control of this coun-
try by violence in the pursuit of their
own selﬁsh interests.

Commends News Service
Editor, The Pitt News:

I want to take this chance to thank
you for the assistance The Pitt News
gave us in our spring elections. Both
the space and ﬁne handling of our
stories did much to make this elec-
tion successful. It was especially
good of you to give us the position on
the front page with the names of the
nominees.

As the retiring president, I want you
to know how gratifying it has been
to feel that all through the year, we
could depend on The Pitt News for
adequate space and sensible, correct
handling of our stories.

VVill you thank Marjorie Reich for
us, for the work she has done as a
Pitt News representative to the
‘WSGA executive committee and also
thank the reporters who have cov-
ered our stories. -

HAZEL LINCOLN,
President WSGA.

 

Misinterpretation
Editor, Pitt News:

The interpretation of the letter
printed in the April 12th issue of The
Pitt News implying that the R. 0.
T_ C. was responsible for the distri-
bution of a handbill ridiculing the
student anti-war meeting is an unjust
accusation which is absolutely un-
founded. The writer, Mr, McConkey,
has allowed his prejudices to over
come his ability to reason and imme-
diately jumped to an unwarranted
conclusion as to the source of these cir-
culars. By this action he has attempt-
ed to place the cadet corps in an un-
favorable position in the opinion of
the student-body. His reference to
the co-ed captains and the Military
Ball had nothing to do with the sub-
ject and were included only to give
him the opportunity to criticize some
of the activities of the Military De-
partment.

We, in the R. O. T. C. were not
responsible for any handbill or circu-
lar against the purposes of the anti-
war meeting.‘ The Miltary Depart-
ment was not aware of the existence

 Letters From Readers 

of any handbills concerning the peace
assembly other than those dissem-
inated by its sponsors. '
The members of the. cadet corps
are fully cognizant of the fact that
war is a social and economic evil.
Vi-’e know better than any other sec-
tion of the student body the destruc-
tion and consequences of warfare, be-
cause we have studied the subject.
Our differences with other anti-war
groups is in the means of prevention.
Vve are not bloodthirsty aggressors
who are preparing for future con-
quests. \-Ve are studying military
training primarily to ﬁt ourselves for
the duties of citizenship. The R. O.
T_ C. believes that it is the duty
of government to protect the citizen,
‘and it is the duty of the citizen to

tional emergency.

It is regrettable that there are stu-
dents in the University who attempt
to take advantage’ of any situation in
order to criticize an organization
whose ideas differ from their own.

So Red Th? Rose
Science And Religion
The Smallest Class

By ROMAN LAPICA

80 Red the Rose
Poets, they bloom in every nook,
but sometimes they have good reason.
To put it bluntly, one of The News
men strolled into the wrong Oakland
eating house the other day. Hours
later he appeared in the oflice, sat
down at the typewriter without say-
ing 3. word and dashed off this one:
“i never saw a purple cow,
i never hope to see one,
but from the milk they served at
lunch,
I know that there must be one.”

 

Science and Religion
Science and religion are compatible.
Reverend C. 1\'I€tl‘Sl1a.ll Muir, W110 ad-

dressed a College Association assem- ,

.ly, believes this statement is true.
He released to The News the first sec-
tion of his article, “The Scientiﬁc
Genesis,” now going to press.

In the article Reverend Muir “re-
wrote” the formation of the earth, the

_Genesis of the Bible, according to sci-

e11tiv1ic fact. It is “liberal,” the min-
ister admitted, but “the advanced
thinkers of today have adopted that
scientiﬁc point of view.” ‘

he article began:

“ln the very beginning God it
was who began creating the Uni-
verse. And there was nothing but
energy, undirectedand chaotic, but
God was’ in the energy and God was
the energy. And God said:

“‘Let this energy be combined in
other forms.’

“And there came the electronic
struct1,lre of matter. And God saw
this basic organization of energy, that
it was fundamental; and the vast
cosmos began its evolution. And God
called this pattern of energy the elec-
tron, and the process He called evo-
lution. And a million years passed——
only yesterday in God’s sight.

“And God said:

“Let this electronic energy be
evolved into other higher forms and
let us create more complex forms
and structures.’ -

And God, creating through the
patterns of force, manifest in shin-
ing stars, glowing suns and whirling.
galaxieshfol-med the universe and
it was so. And He called this the
cosmos. And another million years
had passed-—but another yesterday
in God's sight.”

 

The Smallest Class

Adolph H. Behrenberg——22-year-old
Mt. Lebanon senior——claims he’s a
member of the smallest class in the
University,

He is the only one in it.

Behrenberg today is working for his
BA degree in philosophy. This June
he will be the sole senior to be grad-
uated from the department.

A member of Phi Alpha Theta, hon-
orary history fraternity, Phi Epsilon,
pre-mi-nisterial fraternity, and the
Owl, News and Glee club activities,
Behrenberg is indulging in his share
of campus affairs.

He also was elected recently to the
Undergraduate club of Cap and Gown.

of following the ministry. Next fall

Behrenberg has been teaching re-

 Demonstration Of Consternation

On The Plight Of Modern. Education

 

By Alan Lloyd
in the School of Education
There had been much contemplation
On the matter of the prestige of the"
school. -
Since they felt it insufficient,
By the standard quite deficient,
Well, the students were embar-
rassed, as a rule.

So a group of them together,

Said, “By God we-‘ll soon know
whether

We’re in college or a kindergarten
schooh

For we folks in Education

Have a need--association-—

To uplift our pride and prestige to
the rule.” ‘

So with this determined spirit
They enlisted all who hear it

And prepared a constitution for the
school—

One to help the whole profession
Reach the heights that it, in session,
Had so frequently maintained should

be the rule.

But despite determination

'l'hey secured but condemnation

From the harsh administration of
the school.

intelligent democracy

Has thus become hypocrisy,

Submerged by sheer autocracy of
rule.

And these un-united creatures,

Soon to be our chilclren’s teachers.

Shall go forth to teach “democrac_y"
in schools.

You can guess just what achieve-
ment

Will result from this bereavement.

Which attests the gold in all the
golden rules.

If you think this too vitriolic.

Why, just call the thing a frolic,
And pretend you like the riming
scheme and such; -

But if you think suppression

Has no place in this profession,

Well, announce the fact; I thank
you very much.

the meeting open to expressions “by
students only.” As approved by the
special SFA assembly committee and
the deans and as announced in The
Pitt News Friday, the open forum was

ed students without SFA sponsor-
Ship; but a few minutes before the
meeting Marks announced that he
would preside over the forum also.

Confusion was stirred up when
Marks refused to permit V-’Va1ter
Relis to speak. Itelis is a member of
the National Strike Committee which
conceived the student peace demon-
station idea and initiated the move-
ment on many campuses. Marks main-
tained that the forum was open to
Pitt students only-. After protests
had died down, Hyman lFilmer, C37,
asked to voice Relis’ sentiments,
urged that campus organizations ap-
point an Anti-VV'a.r Comuiittee to func-
tion at the University next year and
to send delegates to a proposed Anti-
War Student Congress.

Homer W'a.dswortl1, ‘C35, ampliﬁed
Filmer's suggestions. David Fagsn,
C36, defended competitive ca.pita.lf-
ism, preparedness, and ﬁghting for
“national integrity.” Attired in his
ROTC uniform, Albert Barr, C37,
maintained that_“men with any back-

iheir country. Bill Edwards, gradu-
ate student, replied that every war
on record has been claimed a_ defen-
sive war by governments on both
sides.

The assembly was dismissed at 12.
o’clock.

Pacic Three

Cats Blow First Half Lead,
Louisiana State Wins, 41-37

Tiger Forward Runs Wild As Southerners Put on Rally
To Win “Rose Bowl” Battle At Atlantic City

Compared to Louisiana State uiiivei'sity’s Buddy Blair, his

neighbor Huey Long is undoubtedly one grand guy.

At any rate,

that’s t.he contention of the Pitt basketball team.

This fellow Blair was the one particular pain in the necks of
the Paiitliers as they lost out in the ﬁnal stages of their "Rose
Bowl” basketball game, 41-37, at Atlantic City on Saturday eve11-

ing.

as he led his t.eam in a great spill‘-‘-9

which wiped out Pitt’s ﬁrst half lead.
At the start of the game a Panther
whirlwind attack left the LOIIISI?-l-T111
boys, undefeated in the -Southeastern
conference, seven points behind be-
fore the first eight minutes had been
played. Letting up only slightly in the
rush, the Golden Cats continued to
pop them in until the timer’s gun end-
ing the half called a halt at 26-17.

The crowd of 6000 which 11,214
watched big Pete Noon and Claire

Cribbs lead their mates in completely
outclassing.-the Tigers of the Ba?-'0uS
was virtually certain that the Panth-
ers had too many claws for their
southern rivals.

But they all reckoned without this
fellow Blair. Just as soon as the sec-
ond half got under Way M11 31331‘
started right out to steal the sliow.
He shot that ball from here, there and
everywliere and it always wound up
in the same place, the basket. The
LSU passing game started to click.
feeding the ball to Blair as he moved
around inside the foul line, and the
Tiger sharpshooter (lid the rest.

‘\‘\-"l1ile all this was going on the
Panthers were able to garner only
seven more points to swell their tot.-3.1.
It was just a. few minutes before the
end‘ of the game when the southern
gentlemen caught up to them at -33-33.
\Vliile the crowd roared, the ‘Louisian-
ian’s hopped into formation, zing
went the ball -down the court, and
swish went the ball through the net.
It was that pesky Blair fellow again.

Here Went the Game

After that it was all over. 'l‘1-ue,
the ‘Cats added four more -points to
their total, but in the brief meantime
the Tigers accounted for six, leaving
the count at 41-37 when the game
ended.

But there wa.s no one in that huge.
auditorium who gave the Panthers
anytliing but a world of credit for
their play. They held those high-
scoring southerners well in check. al-
lowing even the renowned Sparky
Wade, whose quota of ﬁve ﬁeld goals
a. game was an accepted fact all sea-
son. only one ﬁeld goal and a trio of
fouls. Lindsey. Tiger center and an-
other high scoring tlireat, was held to
four ﬁeld goals by Pete Noon,- who
netted ﬁve himself. The Panthers
slipped up on only one man, he being
Mr. Blair.

-C‘la.i.i'e ‘C1-ibbs also accounted for five
ﬁeld goals in the Pitt totals but he took
second to Noon by reason of the lat-
ter’s two successful foul shots. Skip-
py Hughes. Bill Jesko and Ted Rode-
rick, playing at the forward posts, each
scored two ﬁeld goals. Ross Emrlck
made the other three Panther points
with one ﬁeldgoal and a. foul.

Weather is Worst
Handicap In Meet

Bennett, Freshman Star, Counts
10 Points To Lead Scorers

‘Cold weather, nasty head winds.
and a soggy truck couldn’t stop Coacli
Carl Olson's Pather track athletes.
from giving a. ﬁne afternoon show in
the second anni_ia.l University of Pitts-
burgh handicap meet held Saturday at
the stadium. *

But C-roa.i‘s spectacular run in the
880-_va1'(i feature tied the University
record for that distance, and the pe"-
forniances of Menaker in the 1G0.
Kiger in the 4-40, and Musico in the
mile were high class siiowings for so
early in the season

Starting at scratch with his team-
mate. and University champ for the
880. Ha.l Coniieliy, Groat ran a bean-

tit'ull_v-tiined race, doing the first
quarter in  seconds and saving
enough stuff for a ﬁnal sprint. His

time for the half-mile was 1 minute.
57 seconds; C'onnell,v’s closing,spiu't
barely failed to nip Groat at the tape.

In the sprints Sol Menake-r and Dick
Mason. Pitt frosh, divided honors,
with Menaker taking the 100 and Ma.-
soii getting a first in the 2.20. Mena-
l-:er’s time in the short dash was 10
seconds. Mason with a yard handi-
cap took second, with Lasky and
Spitz in third and fourth positions.
In the 220, Mason’s handicap proved
too much for the rest of the ﬁeld, the
former Oliver high ﬂash. easily cap-
turing this event in the fast time of
12 seconds.

Captain Freddy Kiger and a fresh-
man runner, Art Thomas, engaged in
an interesting duel in the quarter-
mile race with Kiger hitting the tape
a few steps ahead of the frosh. His
time was 50.2 seconds. Both Kiger
and Thomas started from scratch.

For three laps Johnny Turcliik,
fresliman miler. led his varsity broth-
ers, but a last lap sprint by Sam ‘Mu.-
sico and Charlev Kirkpa.tric.k proved
his undoing as Musico gained first hon-
ors.

Bennett. with ﬁrsts in the high jump
and broad jump, was high scorer
with 10‘ points. He leaned 21 feet,
93,9 inches in the broad jump with the
aid of a 9-inch handicap, and jumped
6 feet, 2 inches in the high jump.
Other ﬁeld-event winners were Fas-
siuger in the discus. ‘C-rocker and

Last Inning Rally Brings Victory
In First Fraternity Game

Sigma Alpha lcpsilon registered the
initial victory in the Greek mushball
tourney now in progress on the Schen-
ley oval diamonds by outhittiiig Phi
Epsilon in the seventh and ﬁnal
frame, to win, 12-11, last Vvednesday.

Both teams hit freely during the
seven-inning struggle, with the Phi
Eps right on the pace-settei-’s heels
the whole route. The Sl<‘A"s juniped
on pitcher Phi E'p Brown in the last
half of the opening inning to send
three men across the plate for scores.

At the end of the third inning, 'S’FA
led the losers by ﬁve runs. Dutling-
er protected this lead the next frame;
but the Phi Eps wiped it out by tying
the score at 10-all in the ﬁfth and
sixth rounds. Inthe ﬁnal inning, the
Phi Eps, ﬁrst at bat, captured the
lead for the ﬁrst time by sending a
runner across the plate. In the last
half of the seventh, the SFA’s punch-
ed out two runs to regain the lead
and win the ball game, 12-11. S.
Andrews connected for three hits out
of four trips to the plate to lead in
batting.

Today, league “A” shows Phi Epsi-
ion Pi scheduled to play the Pi K A
nine at 5 o’clock on the center Schen-
ley oval ﬁeld. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
meets Sigma Alpha Mu on the side
field at the same time.

Sigma Chi and Pi Lambda Phi will
attempt to open league “B” tomorrow.
A light snow and soggy ﬁeld spoiled
the original opener, and the Thurs-
dal’ “B” game between Kappa. Sigma
and Pi Lambda Phi was called (no
decision) at the end of the third in-
ning by "Umpire .Ioe Tormey, with
the Kappa Sigs leading, 8-2.

Phi Kappa and Kappa Sigma are al-
so in line to play tomorrow in another
“B” game. On Vvednesday, a weather
situation also held back the league
“C" nines. ‘l’-Iowever, Phi Delta Theta
and Theta. Chi are slated for action,
as are the Lambda Chi Alpha and Phi
(T-aiiiiiia. Delta) clubs.

65th Recipient
Of Pitt Spoon
To Be ’36 Class

“From the class of 1.935 to the class
of 1936.”

That is how the sixty-ﬁftli plate on
the historic University spoon will
read on Tap day when the spoon is
presented to the junior class by the-
out.-going seniors. But that doesn’t
tell the whole story.

Way back in the days when the
University was located at Third ave-
nue and Cherry alley, Chancellor
George Vv'oods presented the walnut
spoon, hitherto a valued curio in the
cabinet in the Chancellor's office. to
the members of the senior class after
a very piingent lecture on behavior
and discipline. I-lo likened them to
yolingsters and intimated that the
spoon no doubt would be of use.

It isn’t on the record that student
conduct improved, but the senio.r:s
did get the implications of his gesture
for at the next commencement tliey
presented the spoon to the members
of the junior class,

That was in 1871. Since then the
practice has continued with some in-
terruptions until the present. time.
