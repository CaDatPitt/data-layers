There’s an old saying that states,
“A boat is’ a hole in the water that
you try to ﬁll up with money.” But
in Pittsburgh’s case, that hole isn’t in
the water, it’s beneath it And instead
of  a boat, it’s the North Shore
Connector tunnel

The North Shore Connector
project  as a proposed exten-
sion’ of the Downtown area’s T
network to the North Shore area to
make PNC Park,  Field and a
* future casino easily accessible. The T,
which is owned and operated by the
Port Authority of Allegheny Coun-
ty, currently consists of 25 miles of

- light rail track throughout Down-

town and the South  Village.

When it was proposed in 2003,
the tunnel project had an estimated
cost of $362 million, according to
the Associated. Press In order’ to
complete the project, the Port Au-
thority was awarded a federal grant
to cover the costs, but the project
has run severely over budget since
original estimates were made. As it
currently stands, the tunnel is 80 per-
cent complete and approximately
$118 million short of

l.iETTERSTOTl-IEEDITOR

To the Editor,

I am writing in response toiTuesday’s article and editorial about the Pitt Program Council. The cover-

age on Tuesday was extremely disappointing for various reasons. The overwhelming support we received-

in response told me that those who have taken the time to learn how PPC really works‘ understand our
role. These were current and former students, administrators and even a former editor in chief of The Pitt
News. I believe that if you had taken the time to research our organization as a whole, you could have seen
the-same; ' A I ’ ’ ‘ ,

Your description of my role was inaccurate and sensationalized, seemingly in attempt to make more out
of a story. Without our committee members, we could never be as successful as we are. We rely on them
immensely for their inﬂuence and hard work. Our work is very much a collective effort by our committee
members, executive board and advisers. As a group, we pick, plan and execute our programs.

To misrepresent‘PPC as an autocracy discredits the hard work of so many people. To then criticize us on
this inaccurate perception is wholly unfair. We work hard to live up to expectations put on us by students
and administrators. Our track record speaks to this. We don’t do this for our resumes or to be “the richest

students on campus,” but because we love doing it. Any student can share this experience, and I invite every

Pitt student to actively participate "in PPC, _

I am writing to you today as a student who reads your paper every day. Just as PPC is the students’ pro-
gramming board, this is the students’ newspaper. We look to you for accurate informationabout others’
experiences and ways to impact our own. Representing students and organizations fairly andaccurately

wasteful to leave it half-ﬁnished or should be of the highest priority.
to ﬁll it back in  '
In the ﬁiture, though, perhaps the  Abbott, executive board director

Port Authority could try to lobby for Pitt Program Council ’ Q . i . '
projects that are actually useful to the

community as a whole. Pittsburgh’s ' ‘

public infrastructure is growing old- To the Editor,

er and is ir1 need of nearly constant
repair. Just in the past few years, sev-
eral of the ‘area’s bridge_s have had
to be closed for major repairs or re-
' placement, such as the 
and Fort Duquesne bridges,
And because the Port Authority
' is already having trouble meeting its
basic operating costs, adding large
infrastructure additions and 
to build new ridership probably isn’t
the best way to save money. '
The North Shore Connector

is a disappointing project, and just

because it needs, to be completed K

doesn’t mean it should have been
started in the ﬁrstjplace. Hopefully-

, fair just for a T—shirt. .

As a former Pitt Program Council lecture director, I was excited to see the amount of coverage on the
David Plouffe event and‘ PPC in general. I’m sure a lot of students looked at the front page yesterday and
saw the pie chart and the large ﬁgure that PPC receives from our student activities fee. Yes, the budget is
large, but what most people" don’t put into account is that PPC consists of eight committees built into
one successful student organization. Student Government Board and Student Life have given PPC the op-
portunity to have a large budget mainly because of the same ‘reason Dean Kathy Humphrey signs off o
everything: trust. ‘ _ '

“As a former director, I can say that in order to ﬁgure out what kind of acts people want to see, we would
hand out surveys before, after and during events. The students who usually aren’t satisﬁed are the ones who
throw the surveys to the ground after a PPC‘ event and the ones who just sign up for PPC at the activities

As far as a “less scrupulous or less responsible person” heading PPC, that would never happen. Yes,
Abbott and  the former executive boarddirectors have ﬁnal say, but PPC isn’t a dictatorship. It is a very
close group of students doing their part to ensure other students the best possible college experience.

Five-star reviews don't make albums instant classics

by Justin J acobs
A 0’ E Eaitor

  
 

What makes a classic record clas-
sic? _

_According to Rolling Stone
Magazine, the answer is a five-star
rating. And going with that reason-
ing, two brand new albums have al-
ready achieved such status — U2’s
No ‘Due on the Horizon-and Bruce
Spt:ingsteen’s W22r,éz'ug or: a Drteam. J

Are both records good? Sure. °

Good. Sptingsteen’s Drteam is cer-

tainly his mostaccomplished record

in a handful of years —— better than
Magic, less adventurous than his Pete
Seeger throwback U721 5 hall Overcome
-— but it doesn’t rank with the re-
cords most would consider classics
of the Boss.  you’ve got the
big three — The River; Dar/éuerr on
the Boga of Town and a little record
called Born to Run.

On the U2 front, many critics .

have called No Ijue on the H orizoa the

. band’s best effort since the block-

buster-via—art:istic-freakout Aohluug

Babl. But when you consider U2’s
output between the two albums, the
fact that this is the band’s best al-
bum in almost two decades doesn’t
seem so drastic l997’s Pop? Almost
laughable. All Thar‘ You Cau’t Leave
Behzhd from 2000? Would’ve been
considered an artistic highlight for,
say, Matchbox Twenty, but as a U2
record, it didn’t impress me.

So it’s safe to say that both the
new Springsteen and U2 albums are
certainly returns to form for the art-
ists. But classics?

Rolling Stone’s  system

ranks albums as thus: one star is

poor, ' ascending to four stars (ex-
cellent) and ﬁvevstars (classic). That
last word is printed in every issue of
the magazine in the  descrip-
tions, but very rarely seen actually
assigned to an album. And that’s as

"it sh_ould be — any publication ‘tak-

ing_a critical approach to art should
really think through its  so
that to earn the highest score, said
art has to be truly worth it

But herein lies the problem of

Rolling Stone’s stars ——. by 
five stars “classic,” the magazine sets
itself -up for trouble. The commonly
understood notion of. a classic re-
cord would be one that has earned
the classification through both qual-
ity and impact. -

In other words, Bob Dylan’s
B/orzde ou Blorule is a classic record
because it is truly  but also
because of its great impact on the
entirety of popular music — the re-
cord is a milestone of rock ’n’ roll.

Applying that logic to Bruce and
Bono, we’ve got a serious problem.
Let’s ignore the ‘question of either
new record being actually great ——
that’s a reviewer’s job, and for the
sake of this column, a reviewer I am
not — and look at the implication
of a classic.

It is simply impossible to com-
prehend the impact of either re-
cord because it hasn’t happened
yet They’re just too new. Hell, U2’s
Horizon has dnly been released on
MySpace.’ The physical record won’t
even hit the shelves until March 2.

Rolling Stone’s David Fticke, who,
don’t get me wrong, is one of the
best rock critics since Lester Bangs,
dropped the review on Feb. 20 '—
almost two weeks before the world
even had a chance toyhearthis sup-
posed classic '
And this leads to the most im-
portant point — classics are de-

cided by the fans (of music, not of i

a certain band),_not critics. That is

. not to say that all classic records are
huge sellers, though. Television sold ‘

a paltry number of its masterwork

N Marquee Moon, but the album’s huge

impact on the burgeoning punk
scene and its cache of devoted fans
pushed it to classic status. Had only

critics championed it, it would’ve -

been forgotten.

But for fans to attach themselves
to a record or for that record’s im-
pact on music to be even remotely

calculated, one  is crucial —

s time.

Marquee Moon wasn’t a classic
when it came out in 1977, it was just
a really great record.

And that’s what Horizon and
Wor,éz'ag or: a Dream are. Really great
records. But not classics. Not yet
—— and if you ask me, neither ever
will be. The days of classic U2 and
Springsteen both ended a long, long
time ago, though this doesn’t ne-‘
gate that either still writes good, if
not great, music ’Well, not U2. U2
stopped being even remotely awe-
some around 1992. But" I digress.

Rolling Stone used‘ to be criti-
cized for bashing records that even:
tually became undeniable classics
(ever heard of Led _Zeppelin?). But
today, the magazine’s been doing
quite the opposite —  das-
sic albums years before the word
shoulél even be uttered. S

A ﬁve-star rating is ﬁne, but not
when it implies a classic lCan’t it be
called something else, like really, re-
ally, really, really, really good?
