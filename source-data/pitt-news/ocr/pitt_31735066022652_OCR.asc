State Treasurer In Disagreement With Thornburghs Cuts

By SETH LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer

State Treasurer Robert E. Casey
is reacting negatively to Gov. Dick
Thornburgh’s request to slash state
appropriations to universities and
state-related institutions October
1--at least he opposes any cuts oc-
curing that early in the year.

Casey said he would prefer to
continue full payments until the
last quarter, or spring, and then if
necessary go ahead with Thorn-
burgh’s proposed 10 percent slash
in the $335 million earkmarked for
Pitt, Penn State, Temple, Lincoln
and the other universities and in-
stitutions not under the com-
monwealth’s direct control.-

Field House
Renovations
Progressing

By CLARE GLEASON

Pitt News Staff Writer

‘The Fitzgerald Field House is
presently being renovated at an
estimated cost of $1.4 ‘million, ac-
cording to Senior Vice Chancellor, -
Jack Freeman. 1

The renovations, according to
John A. Sopcisak, program coor-
dinator from the Office of Facilities
Planning, “will serve a two-fold
purpose: one, a basketball floor for
multiple purposes and two, increas-
ed seating for basketball or any
other field house events in the stu-
dent section of approximately 1000
seats.”

This was accomplished by putting
a platform over the track area on
the east end of the Field House.
Seven rows of bleachers-were cut
from the present section to provide
the necesary space. The new
bleachers will fold over the plat-
form that will also serve as a court
above the present courts, according
to Sopcisak.

“Additional seating, another
court, and another restroom facili-
ty, along with a concession stand on
the side of the student section, all of

which are direly needed,” will be .

the result of the renovations, Sop-
cisak said.

When we left this column last
week, the fate of Therese Barch and
her housing assignment was still in
the hands of Jo Ann Woodson,
director of the Office of Residence
Life. And the prospects for any
type of immediate reversal of the
decision to displace Barch seemed
pretty grim, considering Woodson
had just left for a week-long vaca-
tion and Tim Snyder, her assistant,
was never fully expecting the surge
of inquiries as to why Barch was
displaced after her contract had
been signed.

For those newcomers to the saga,
it was a rather simple story: one

“Of course I’m reacting negative-
1y, I don’t think that they should be
cut,” Casey said in‘a telephone in-
terview. “However, in the Gov-
ernor’s good judgment he feels
there’s just no money to handle it at
this time. I agree with him on that
part, but I don’t agree on his man-
ner of handling it.”

Thornburgh has requested that
the cuts occur in the second quarter
of the fiscal year, but Casey said the
cuts should be deferred until spring
to give the legislators in Harrisburg
a chance to raise the revenues need-
ed to fund a budget deficit.

“I feel that if we were to cut it in
the second quarter, then the schools
would immediately have to raise
tuitions in order to come up to (the

to’ finish before basketball season.

“The concrete deck was poured
last week and is presently curing,”
Sopcisak said. “We hope to have,

in service by the time school
starts,” he added. _

The upper courts are being built
primarily for use in intermurals and
other independent groups, rather
than official team use.

According to E. Tracy Lewis,
athletic facilities coordinator, the
courts were built “to make sure
students get equitable consideration
for recreational facilities.”

because she was a top scholar in the
university. On April 4, Barch signed
a contract and put $100 deposit
down on Room 857 Lothrop Hall, a
suite that shares a bathroom, closet,

and kitchen with two other singles. ~

Considering she was invited to stay
in the residence halls, Barch was ex-
empt from the lottery system.

But then, in a letter dated'June
25," from Woodson, Barch was in-
formed she would be moving down
the hall to a single so that a newly
hired “area coordinator” could be
moved into the Lothrop suite.

Needless to say, Barch was slight-
ly upset. She contacted various state
officials and the chancellor to at-
tempt to get her room back.

And then, on July 25, another
development. It turns out Barch
was not alone in getting displaced

aren’t prepared to do that now.

“I also feel that by doing this,
he’s putting a gun at the head of the
legislature and saying ‘Do this or
else.’ Then they will be forced into
some drastic action which I feel that
they wouldn’t have an opportunity
to better digest,” Casey added.

Casey said he wants to continue
the full payments up to the last
quarter “and at that time, if
necessary,” school would be almost
over and the cuts and subsequent
tuition hikes would be better

* assimilated within the universities.

“It will still give the legislature,

or others, the opportunity ‘of ﬁn-

ding a means of coming up with the '

“I publish a schedule that details
when all facilities are available for
recreational usage,” Lewis ‘said.
These schedules are available
through his office in the student
union.

“If a student group wants to
reserve an athletic facility, they may
do so through my office, given the

space is available at the requested’

time. Usually we need 30 days ad-
vance notice, but requests may be
granted at shorter notice if the
space is available. Students should
do some planning ahead of time to
ensure space availability,” he add-
ed. ’

Casey said he was not sure if he
had the legal authority to disburse
the appropriations on a different
payment schedule than the gover-

“I just want to be sure before I
go out half-cocked and make an an-

that it would be the better way,”

To the Editor: July 24, 1980

I welcome your invitation to of-

fer a few observations and com-

ments about the current dilemma
confronting the University of Pitts-
burgh with respect to its state ap-
propriation.

First, I want to make clear the
votes that I have cast this year con-
cerning Pitt’s appropriation and
related issues. I voted in favor of
the Appropriations Bill for the
University of Pittsburgh as well as
for an amendment that would have
increased the appropriation by
several hundred thousands of
dollars. On July 9, 1980, I voted in
favor ‘Of the Fee Bill, Senate Bill
1299, that some argue is necessary if
the University and other non-
preferreds are to be fully funded for
the 1980-81 ﬁscal year. I also voted
against the General Appropriations
Bill which, in my opinion, was not a
balanced budget and led to the cur-
rent financial dilemma now con-
fronting state government and the
recipients of non-preferred ap-
propriations.

It is rather clear to any objective
observer that state appropriations
to the state-related schools, in-
cluding the University of Pitts-
burgh, have not kept pace with in-
ﬂation in recent years. While it
would be unreasonable to expect
that tuition increases would occur
at a university, I do feel that such
increases would have been kept to a
lower figure if state appropriations
would have increased at a more
reasonable rate.

I am deeply disturbed by the cuts
that the Governor is now threaten-
ing for the budgets of Pitt and other
institutions. We are witnessing
once again the “hostage” situation
that has confronted the University
community on several other occa-
sions since the mid-sixties. I have
personally experienced the “hos-
tage” gimmick played from the
perspective of a Pitt student and a

Pitt employee and, most recently,
as a legislator. From any point of
view, it is most unsatisfactory.

The particular problem confront-
ing us today is especially revolting
since it was quite avoidable. The
revenue shortage that is now being
discussed was quite predictable and
obvious to many of usvwhen the
General Budget was considered in
June. Unfortunately, far too many
observers of state government were
more concerned about the
timeliness of that budget legislation
rather than its contents or ramifica-
tions.

With respect to the current situa-
tion, I think it is important to note
that the so-called Fee Bill which is
under consideration in Harrisburg
will raise only approximately $8
million of the $40 million that the
administration says is necessary to
fully fund the non-preferreds. The

remaining $32 million is a matter of .

administrative decisions over which
the legislature has little control.
This is another reason why I believe
the actions of the majority in the
House and Senate and in the Gover-
nor's office are regrettable since we
have seemingly left the solution to
this problem to non-legislators.

I truly hope that we will learn a
lesson from this year's situation
which is simply a repeat of an ex-
perience of prior years. I believe we
need to change /the budgetary pro-
cess so that the four state-related in-
stitutions of higher education, the
major recipients of non-preferred
appropriations, can be included in
the General Appropriations Bill.

Such action requires a constitu-
tional amendment which I introduc-
ed on February 7, 1979, in the form
of House Bill 158. Unfortunately,
that legislation has not had the ac-
tive support of key university of-
ﬁcials nor has it had support of cer-
tain legislative leaders who can
greatly inﬂuence the bill's destiny.

I believe there are three major
beneﬁts to be derived from the
legislation I have introduced. First,

it will give due recognition to the
state-related schools as integral
parts of our Commonwealth’s
system of higher education.
Second, it will close the existing
loophole in our constitutional
obligation to pass a balanced
budget by including in the General
Appropriations Bill all of the
significant expenditures of state
gove’rnment which are to be funded
by General Fund Revenues. This
will mean a more responsible
budgeting process. Third, it will
bring an end to that unconscionable
process in which -institutions of
higher education are blamed for tax
and/or fee increases when, in fact,
they receive only nominal increases
equalling sums far less than the
revenues derived from the new or
higher taxes and fees.

Finally, I will continue to support
the fee increase legislation, but
again’ emphasize it is only a small
part of the revenue solution re-
quired to fully fund the non-
preferreds. If required, I will also
support legislation to re-open the
1980-81 General Appropriation
Budget to make those adjustments
needed to fund the non-preferred
appropriations within revenue

forecasts’ from existing taxes and.

fees.

I appreciate the opportunity to,

offer these remarks concerning this
very important issue and would be
pleased to discuss these ideas and
other suggestions with members of
the university community at their
convenience. E ‘

cerning my attitude towards higher
education and the State-related in-

stitutions in particular, I am pleased
to give you my views. First, my
voting record in the General
Assembly will show my consistent
support for all higher education
programs. I have long been an ad-
vocate of higher education and have
supported funding within the finan-
cial limitations that the Common-
wealth finds itself.

As a former teacher I was happy
to see a change of administrations
in Harrisburg that puts an emphasis
on productive programs rather than
the social give-away programs that
were top priority during the 1970’s.

However, I have another major
concern which" I feel deserves a
priority in the educational portions
of our State Budget. First, I think
our basic obligation is the State
School Subsidy Programs that fund
our public local schools. State law
calls for the State to pay 50 percent
of all funding and at the present
time we are somewhere around 43
percent. This must be our first
obligation when allocating funds.
Secondly, the Commonwealth has
an obligation to the State college
and university systems that it has
created and it has been for years ig-
noring. Next come the State-related
institutions who likewise have great
needs if they are to meet their goals.

It is on this struc_ture of priorities ,

that I base my decisions for the fun-
ding of higher education in Penn-
sylvania. Every program is a wor-
thwhile program and deserves our
support. Naturally, we would like
to give more and more money to
these institutions, but it is fiscally
impossible to do so. We are going
to go through a period of difficult
times and very small budget in-
creases and every recipient of state

funds, regardless of the program, is '

going to have to learn to do with
less State aid. It may not be a plea-
sant thought to those who have
vested interests in these particular
programs, but the people are
demanding it and elected officials
are going to carry out those wishes
of the public.

I hope this explains my views on
the question of the future of State
funding of the State-related institu-
tions. I am pleased to have the op-
portunity to express my views.

Car Sickness Reveals This Year’sModel

CAR SICKNESS E.P.
Car Sickness

By SAM MATTHEWS

After the plans and the almost schemes,
Pittsburgh finally has some local music on
record.

If you haven't heard, Car Sickness is a
young band ( 6 months at time of recor-
ding) of a decidedly punk/ new wave intent.

In following with the best punk tradition of
bands independently putting out ‘a record,
we have the release of the Car Sickness EP.
The Car Sickness/T.M.I. people deserve
much credit for financing, producing and
distributing the self-made record.

Contained on this four song EP are
"Police Dog,” "Bill Wilkerson,” (i.e.,
"What Do You Say To The KKK?")
"When" and ”Me And My Cruiser”. The
arrangements of these songs are precision
perfect and the actual performance is hot.
As Car Sickness is young, these songs have

matured even more since these recordings
were made in May.

Hopefully the Car Sickness EP is only the
first step in allowing other local bands ‘to
make the transition to vinyl. Also, a
follow-up Car Sickness release is being
discussed. To obtain the Car Sickness pro-
duct, contact them at:

been done before in I. Geils, Graham

they are able to rejuvenate the heavy rock

MADE IN PITTSBURGH VOL. I
Various
Bogus Records

By SCOTT MOWRY

Made In Pittsburgh is a fantastic idea that
should have been done a long time ago.
But, better late than never.

As the music blossoming out of Pitts-
burgh fights for national recognition (and
thanks to The Houserockers, David Werner
and The Silencers, headway is being made),
every little bit helps.

Made In Pittsburgh's co-ordinator and
sometime musician‘ Carl Grefenstette
deserves much credit for taking on such an
ambitious and overwhelming project.

“There’s a lot of good music in Pitts-
burgh. And a lot of talented musicians
behind it,"'iw‘rites Grefenstette on the liner
notes of the album. And any frequenter to
Pittsburgh nightspots can attest to that.

But the major problem with Made In
Pittsburgh is that a lot of the Steel City's

more original, more adventurous musicians

“ are not represented on this collection. Too

few of these groups are either working or
are prominent on the city's music scene.
The Corbin Hanner Band and Empire being

A the lone exceptions.

Made In Pittsburgh is comprised of 16
tracks from ten various local groups. The
artists range from country to new wave,
rockabilly to straight-forward rock.

The Silencers: Rock ’N’ Roll

(Continued from page 1)
vocals, Warren King—guitars, Mike Pella
--bass, Dennis Takos—l<eyboa'rds, and
Ron Foster—drums.
Foster—drums.

OK, admit it. Isn't "Shiver and Shake"
one of the catchiest singles you've heard on
the radio in a long time? Ditto for "Modern
Love." "Head on Collision" should be
another good one. Hell, this is a whole
album of singles. Think of Rock 'N' Roll
Enforcers as a radio package by itself.

Czuri has the voice. King can pull licks
out of nowhere yet he knows what works
well. ‘He only plays what's needed. Takos
supplies the right amount of undercurrent
keyboard phrasing. And the rhythm sec-
tron of Foster’ and Pella never miss a beat.
Color the Silencers modern. The first band
to come out of this city to be thinking ahead
instead of looking back.

The highlights of the album include:
"Grand Larceny" by the now defunct Eddie
and The Otters is far and away the record's
best cut. It is a clever pop gem in vintage
Sixties British Invasion style.

The Hank Band's "(My Baby's In) Prep
School" is not bad either, but suffers from a
weak mix.

Country crooner, Leslie Smith, has a
stellar voice but sounds best on the Tanya
Tucker-like ”Fool Hearted Woman” rather
than the Linda Ronstadt-like "High Wind."

Empire's Steve Karl is unquestionably
one of Made In Pittsburgh ’s better musi-
cians. His licks on “You Make Me High”
and especially “Piece Of The Action” are
powerful but ultimately, his songs suffer
from lackluster arrangements.

Made In Pittsburgh's overall concept is
right on. But how it is done is off target.
The proported Volume 2 would greatly
benefit from a more careful selection and
more truthful representation of music in
Pittsburgh. The Cardboards, Combo Tac-
tic, The Rave Ups, Car Sickness, the East
Liberty Angels, Love Sick, Norm Nardini

and Billy Price are bands that represent-

some of the finest of what Pittsburgh has to
offer and cannot be overlooked when com-
piling an accurate "best of" compilation.

But nonetheless, Grefenstette and friends
should be encouraged. Working within a
low budget and limited resources they have
accomplished something very worthwhile.
Made In Pittsburgh, Volume I was a good
start, Volume II should- be even better.

HOME

Directed by George Lehane
Written by David Storey
Carnegie-Mellon Theatre Company

By CANDICE KOMAR

Home is definitely not a play designed to
appeal to a mass audience. It takes a cer-
tain amount of effort to sit through a per-
formance that has practically no plot, ac-
tion or memorable dialogue. David Storey
has written a play (the winner of the‘ New
York Critics Award for 1970) which relies
heavily on its actors’ talents to sustain its
meaning, one that never does become quite
clear.

The play is about two men and two
women, all of whom are in a mental home
in England. The plot seems to center
around how many chairs are out on the ter-
race for them to sit on and how they are go-

« ing to go about getting enough for all four

of them to be able to sit down together to
pass the timebetween meals and teatime.

The conversations that take place among
them are rarely complete sentences, just
snatches of colloquial expressions. Storey

 Out-Of-Focus ‘Home’ Neg

are often slipped by because they are tucked
in between silly, trite bantering.

Something interesting to notice is the
level of intimacy in the conversations that
the two men have with one another, and
the two women between themselves. But
when they are all four together, another
plane of closeness is reached in which they
all seem to realize without mentioning it
that they all are reaching for something to
hold onto, and all they have is each other.
They certainly don't have their complete
sanity so they can't rely on themselves. All
four of them fail to overtly recognize this
fact, but one gets the feeling that they in-
trinsically know it is true.

The entire play is wrapped in a soft sort
of sadness, despite cheery stretches, of
dialogue and Kathleeen's (Elizabeth Orion)
loose antics. Both Harry and Jack (Kermit
Brown and Michael Pierce) have crying fits
sporadically throughout the play and Mar-
jorie (Susan Willis) is on the verge of tears
as part of her normal disposition. One gets
the strongest impact of the pervasive gloom
when they discuss topics particular to the
outside world of which they are no longer a
part of. They speak of the ”home” out
there that they have twisted in their own

...a play whose tensions result in an animal-like courtship

DePalma Plays Hitchcock

DRESSED TO KILL
Written and directed by Brian DePalma

By THOM PALMER

It is difficult to say whether the biggest
star in Dressed To Kill is director Brian
DePalma or the late Sir Alfred Hitchcock.
The answer would probably be DePalma,
who has mitigated the Hitchcock finesse
enough to attach his own name to the film,
which plays like the echolalia of Psycho
forced through a collander.

Attaching 'a label of good or bad to this is
somewhat more difficult. All the elements
are there: slick sequences of long, dialogue-
less narrative, zooming and rescinding
overhead shots, a peppering of tiny details
that are sometimes reiterated through a
memory refreshing split screen, and the
opening and closing of doors, drawers and
faces reacting to surprise and terror that
lasts four or five beats to a measure longer

than is endurable.

Angie Dickenson plays a sexually un-
satisfied woman who seeks the help of
psychiatrist Dr. Elliott (Michael Caine).
The Police Woman refugee is surprisingly

watchable. This is fortunate for DePalma,
since Dickenson is in every scene up
until...well, let's just say that Janet Leigh's
shower becomes Angie Dickenson’s
elevator. Then, the strange fun begins.
DePalma’s characters all possess enough
predictability of action and attitude that we
know them before they even open their
mouths. Because of this, no one stands out
other than DePalma. Dressed To Kill is his
film all the way. The film is technically

sound; DePalma does know how to use a A

camera. And in keeping with the director
who DePalma gave a quasi-blatant imita-
tion of, being technically sound doesn't
necessarily make a good story-teller. This
is the same type of criticism which usually
befell Hitchcock. DePalma shows that he is
also a fine plotter (or plagarist, depending
on your devotion to Sir Alfred) of shots,
but the skin of his narrative shows itself to
be a bit thin.

Dressed To Kill has a summery flavor to
it that might make it catch on for a month,
or even two. One can only watch it with
the hope that Dressed To Kill is just a pet
project that DePalma has always wanted to
do, just to try his hand at playing Hitch
cock. For serious film-goers, one can only
keep the faith that summer will end soon.

THE SEAHORSE
Directed by James Gardner

By DYLAN WILLIAMS

During one scene of The Seahorse, Ger-
trude Blum, the caustic owner of the
Seahorse Bar, tells her boyfriend, Harry
Bales, a rough but dreamy sailor who's just
returned from the sea, that she wants to
dance. Harry says no, naturally, but when
Gertrude soon returns with a phonograph
and album, he bregrudgingly accepts. Ger-
trude puts on a Pure Prairie League song,
and as the couple dances, Harry's reluc-
tance changes to approval. Everything is
sweet and calm for a while until Harry
(once again) brings up the subject of mar-
riage and Gertrude explodes. The end
result is a seesaw of emotions and shouts, as
the words of the song, ”...don’t know what
I'm gonna do; I keep fallin’ in and out of
love with you..." subtly weave their way
through the arguing, leaving an ironic ring
throughout the theater that lasts until the
end of the play. '

What are they going to do? Harry is a ,

man capable of dreaming up a son who
talks to him. He hears rotary shafts say, "I
love Gertrude" and a glass-like ocean telling
him to settle down and start a family. Con-
versly, Gertrude is a woman of shattered
dreams, a woman who held her father as he
died from a sailor's stab wound. She is a
woman who married young and suffered

' through beatings and rape only to come out

‘Airplane’Spoofs ‘Airport’ J

aks of The DepthsOf Love 

alone and very, very tough. Harry loves
Gertrude. Gertrude loves Harry, too, but
her scars from the past don't allow her to
open up to Harry's love. The result is a
frustrating emotionally animal-like court-
ship for the couple that pulls the audience in
with it.

According to the director, James Gard-
ner, the plays that the SOHO Company per-
form are chosen because they ”possess a
strong narrative through-line yet still con-
tain a robust undercurrent of (metaphorical
action.” This is especially true in The
Seahorse. Several times during the produc-
tion the strength of the narrative, as emo-
tions and hopes again and again rose and
them plummeted, made the audience sigh
with the same frustration. This of course,
was due not only to a strong script, but
strong acting as well.

Barbara Whitney, who played Gertrude,
possesses all the physical features needed
for the part. Her voice and figure are rough
and strong, whereas her face and hair are
pretty and girlish if she wants to make them
so. Likewise, David Lindberg (Harry) uses
his voice and posture very well in convey-
ing both his rejection and his determina-
tion. The chemistry between the couple
worked, also providing" the kind of intensi-
ty that only a cast of two can.

The Seahorse is one of two plays being
performed this summer by the SoHo Reper-
tory Theatre on Fifth Avenue. Their next
production is Suicide in B Flat by Pulitzer
Prize winner Sam Shepard.« It runs from
August 9 thru 24. _

AIRPLANE
Directed by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker
and Jerry Zucker. '

By DYLAN WILLIAMS

Robert Stack put it best a couple of weeks
ago on a talk show when he commented on
Airplane by saying, ”What an insane pic-
turel" Stack plays Kramer, the man who is
called in from hornewin order to talk the
troubled plahevdowdlto the ground. In the
old Airport movies, this character is usually
portrayed as a grumpy man who deep
down really has a soft heart. In this film he
just plain old mean and unsympathetic.
And very funny, too.

The concept behind the making of the
film becomes clear after the first few
minutes. The writers studied the old Air-
port scripts, took every’comy scene and

cliche line, and then tore them to bits. A
macho pilot in Airport? All right, then how

about a gay pilot in Airplane? A flashback A

--love scene on the beach? OK. This time
cover the guy with seaweed. An affair with
the Captain's wife? Sure. Just use the horse
this time. And so on. The film almost
buries itself burying the cliches, but always r
manages to rise up and continue forward on
the razor’s edge before the audience stops
laughing. The writing has a classy, vintage
Carol Burnett Show style, though the
material is strictly Satu1;dayOI;ii:ghtU%1i|séﬁm_
Everything is game in this fi m. ' ove,
death, Jews, blacks, whites, commercials,
nuns, doctors, drinking problems, the
press, fish, and the war, all fall under the ax
of satire that ranges in humor from grey to
black, always WASPy and occasionally ab-
surd.

This isn't exactly a star-studded cast, as
the Airport films always pride themselves in

‘Airplane’ Spoofs (cont.)

(Continued from page M

having, though the film once again
capitalizes by having Kareem Abdul Iabbar
in as co-pilot McDouglas. A young boy
comes into the cockpit and calls him by his
real name instead of his stage name, thus
ending the misery that Airport put one
through by trying to make you believe that
some big name superstar was really just a
baggage boy or a priest on his way to some
missionary work. The picture does have its
popular role call, however. Lloyd Bridges,
Peter Graves, Leslie Nielsen and Robert
Stack are all just fine, although Julie Hager-
ty, Robert Hayes and Stephen Stucker are
the ones who stand out. '

One nicely done scene is a serious one

between Leslie Nielsen and Robert Hayes A

concerning an old pilot friend of Hayes’. It
stands out as being on of the key reasons
why the film is good and funny, instead of
merely funny and substanceless.

It’ is impossible that a film like this, with I

all of its biting humor, might just make the
filming of another Airport movie futile.

That's too bad, because Airport movies are '

generally well made. However, it would be
a great service to the public if about 90 per-
cent of the movies this summer got satirized
off the screen with the humor Airplane has.

(P.S. For extra laughs; stick around for,’

the credits at the end.) _
