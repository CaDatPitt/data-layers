men and women to ﬁnd what the
true political situation is at th

Poll-takers of the News are

Once Again Pitt Panther
Builds-up to Awful Letdown

BULLETIN:

‘Editor Frank S. Miller, early
this morning, reached into his up-
per right hand drawer and drew
out form S-43, revealing that the
Pitt Panther will not appear on
campus per schedule but will be
out on Friday.

4-’ :3 31¢ '

“Off the presses by Christmas”
shouts" editor Frank Miller, C41, as
the Pitt Panther, more or less
monthly humor magazine, today is
due again to appear on campus.
This almost daily occurrence will,
according to Miller, become a re-
ality with the October edition.

If you have not yet been ap-
proached by a Panther salesman,
Miller will positively have his mag-
azine out within the next three
weeks.

A luncheon meeting for Panther
business and editorial staffs is
scheduled at 12:30 o’clock today in
the Cathedral Mansions, but ex-
perienccd Panther-meeting-attend-
ers are inclined to cast doubt upon
the probability of the luncheon’s
occurring. However, both Miller
and business manager Al Gross,
BA4l, maintain that the luncheon
will take place since it is not to be
ﬁnanced from today’s sales.

Should the Panther appear, as
scheduled, it will be chockfull of

special articles which readers should

make a particular effort to ignore.
The Panther’s non-partisan candi-
date for president will be announced
in a story which should arouse con-
siderable disinterest.

Oscar Sheﬂer’s composite parody
in the styles of William Saroyan and
a number of other irresponsibles,
two brandnew space-ﬁlling depart-
ments, a special gossip supplement,
Miller’s anecdotage, and some other
stuff can also be easily avoided.

The price is still 15 cents, as

though it mattered.

Bacall Lists Aides

manager‘ of the Pitt News, has an-
nounced his staif appointments for

Kelly Encorcs in ‘Time of

When University—graduate Fred

Kelly opened at the Nixon this 
week in a featured lead of Saroyan’s

“Time of Your Life,” he brought a
taste of enthusiasm and real success
back to theatrically indifferent
Pittsburgh.

A former Cap and Gown star
noted for his dancing novelties on
roller skates, fast-stepping Fred
walked into the Broadway success
in September to take over the role
created by his more famous brother
Gene, also a Pitt man. In this lat-
est Saroyan drama, lauded by critics
as bringing “third dimension” to the
stage, Fred has the only dancing
role as a born hoofer who is miser-
able because he longs to be a come-
dian.

After running on Broadway the
entire last season, the play is on the
first stop of a nation-wide tour,
stopping next at Chicago and fol-
lowing through Canada, the Middle
West, and probably California.
Brother Gene, being in demand for
rehearsals of “My Pal Joey” which
opens on Broadway in six weeks,
was the leading factor in persuad-
ing Fred to give up dance instruc-

Mcteorologists’
Devices Arrive

A recording rain gauge is one of
,‘the instruments which will be used
‘for the new meteorology course to
be added to the University curricu-
him next spring.

; ._,,, New instruments, according to

Donald D. Bradford, University
seismologist, also include a maxi-
mum and minimum thermometer
indicating the upper and lower ex-
tremes of temperature over periods
of 24 hours, a recording microbaro-
graph showing changes in pressure
during the week, and a recording
hydro-thermograph showing the
relative humidity in the air and the
temperature.

To supplement these instruments,
the department is borrowing a dust
counter, ultra-violet equipment, and
carbon dioxide and carbon monox-
ide analyzers from Mellon Institute.

Under construction at the present
time is a microbarograph for ob-
serving short period pressure osci.l—
lations. A large loop antenna has
already been built.

Mr. Bradiord will teach the basic
course in meteorology next spring.

A la Hollywood

Will Bradley and his orchestra,
Columbia artists and “the outstand-

Metronome magazine, will play this
Friday evening for the Pitt Premier
in the Urban room of the William
Penn hotel.

Jack Hoeveler, L43, will be master

will interview couples over a public
address system as they pass up the
roped aisles to the Urban room.
The ballroom will be lighted from

all in the “tvraditional picture pre‘- ~

mier style.” Hoeveler announces
that there will be no wet cement
for the footprints of famous stu-
dents on campus.

The sale of tickets will be limited,
according to Aldo Icardi, C43, pub-
licity manager, to permit greater
freedom in dancing. The price per
couple is $2.50 and the dancing will
begin at 9 o’clock.

The second complimentary ticket
to the Pitt Premier was awarded to
Bob Page, C44, who gave the cor-
rect titles to the second series of
the Pitt Premier contest.

The titles are: “When the Moon
Comes Over the Mountain,” and
“Rag Time Cowboy Joe.” The third

Campus Willkie Leader
Predicts GOP Landslide

Fred Roth, Ed4l, was named
permanent, chairman of the Pitt
wiiiiee-“rel-* President club at a
meeting of the organization last
Friday. A1 Holbrook, E41, was
elected vice-president and Jean
Doehla, Ed4l, secretary—treasurer.

In assuming oﬂfice, Roth predicted
that Wendell Willkie would score
an overwhelming victory in Novem-

ber.

Your Life’

tion and try the legitimate stage.

Fred’s performance has been
weighed and approved by New York
critics, but the greatest tribute he
received came when Charlie Chap-
lin, coming backstage after watch-
ing a performance, last week-, pat-
ted Fred’s shoulder and smiled.

Graduating irom the University
in 1939, Fred was a member of
three Cap and Gown shows, a mem-
ber of Phi Kappa social fraternity,
and worked as an instructor in his
brother’s dance studios. He smil-
ingly admitted that he first became
interested in the stage when by ne-
cessity he spent hours driving down
from the Johnstown studios trying
to invent new excuses for being late
for classes. His most pleasant
memories of college are connected
with Cap and Gown shows, crowds
in the Tuck shop, and a lecture on
Germany which he gave before Dr.
Ferguson’s economics classes last
year.

Commenting on the quality of
C&G productions, Fred commended
the scripts and songs, but lamented
that rehearsals were not taken ser-
iously enough until the last minute.

Phi Kappa Wins
Runner-up Spot
With List of 21

Although falling short of the
1938 record, this year’s list of
.fraternity pledges topped the
total of last year by 27.

r\.ccorcling to lists released by
Robert R-. Corley, assistant dean
of men, 180 men pledged the social
fraternities, compared to 153 of last
year. The record is 204.

Delta Tau Delta with 26 pledges
broke the individual fraternity rec-

ord set by the Phi Delta Theta last

year. Phi Delta Theta’s record was
21 pledges.

Phi Kappa, pledging 23 men, was
second highest, and Phi Epsilon Pi
and Pi Kappa Alpha were third
with 18 men each.

All fraternities held dinner:-and
“get-togethers” after pledging cere-
monies on Monday.

Men pledged are:

Delta Tau Delta-

Jack Hagan, John Foley, Jack
Hutchinson, Carl Bauer, William
Cook, Richard Downie, George
Atherholt, William Heckman, John
Kennedy, Byron Svenson, John W.
Veil Jr., Robert S. Totten, Thomas
Pitzer, John Weiler, William E. Rid-
dle, Don E. Sietam, Robert E.
Johnston, Henry A. Loutzenhiser,

Corley Call Corny,
Colleagues Cash In

It’s getting to be an old story
with Robert R. Corley, assistant
dean of men, when it comes to los-
ing bets on the number of men
pledging fraternity after the an-
nual fall rush week.

This year he wagered Messrs.

-Biddle and Williams, also ‘of the»

dean of men’s staﬁ’, that approxi-
mately 222 men would accept bids
to the 13 campus social fraternities.

Therefore, Mr. Corley will be
forced to purchase at his own ex-
pense, dinners for his brother wag-
erers because Mr. Williams thought
196 would pledge and Mr. Bid-
dle’s score sheet showed only 189.
All were wrong as only 180 ac-
cepted bids.

Mr. Carley is much relieved over
the easy payment of the bet. Last
year he had a mustache which was
the pride of the dean of men’s of-
ﬁce. but alas he lost it-—yes—~he bet
on the number of pledges and lost.

Pitt Boys and Friend
Hold a Bull Session

By Ruggero Aldisert

We were sitting on soft leather seats, talking politics
and about Pitt.

' There were four of us—Oscar Shelfer, C41; Dave
Boies, BA42; Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., University of
Virginia ’40; and myself.

We had met young Franklin at the airport about
a half hour before and had been chatting in his hotel
room for about ﬁve minutes, easing off the awe that
comes when you meet the son of the President of the
United States. I

“Well, truthfully now, Mr. Roosevelt, had you ever
heard of Pitt before, that is, outside of the football
teams?”

He ﬂashed that smile: “Why certainly, I hear you
have the most beautiful school building in the country.
I’ve seen it.”

He opened his pack of Philip Morris.
Oscar accepted. He lit all three cigarettes.

“And since I’m a New Yorker, nowadays, I guess
I can call it ‘our’ team that won last Saturday. Say,
what did Harvard do?”

We didn’t know.

Of Cabbage and Kings

And so we lounged in our chairs and talked. Talked
about the Roosevelt College club movement, the Young
Democratic clubs, and things politic.

Dave and

Joe Barr, his host for the Pittsburgh visit, came in’

and pulled up a chair. Joe graduated from Pitt in ’29
and is former state president of the Young Democratic
clubs.

Joe called him Frank, and in the next ﬁve minutes
Joe and Frank made a conversational tour of the United
States asking each other what “what’s-his-name was do-
ing these days.” . , .

Dave and Oscar and I felt pretty big. There we
were, a couple of young college punks, sitting in with
a fellow who referred to nationally-known ﬁgures as
“Bill” and “Jim” and “that chap from Indiana, I can’t
remember his name, but he looks like a little White
mouse.”

Youth‘ and Politics

iWe_ got started on the New Deal again.

"I forgot who brought it up, but we had just ﬁnished
asking about the percentage of colleges that had col-
lege club units, when he was asked what was the most
important New Deal accomplishment.

I “My father feels that the one most important thing
accomplished in the last seven years has been to stim-
ulate interest and activity by young people in local
and national government.

“Youth was discouraged in 1933,” we offered. _

He said that in his traveling he was particularly
impressed by the unusually keen interest in this elec-
tion on the part of college students. He compared it
to the last presidential election, to 1936, when he was
an undergraduate at Harvard, and said that “you’d
be surprised at the difference in attitude today.”

Dave passed the smokes around this time. We all
took one.

Oscar made a crack about him ﬂying all over the
place and back, saying that in Sunday’s papers he was
reported in Detroit and that the next thing Oscar
knew. FDR Jr.  ﬂying in from New York.

We all laughed. Oscar is funny.

‘I Liked this Guy’ -

But this chap really gets around. He was leaving
for Iowa Monday night and intends to hop all over the
coast states by the end of the week. He hasn’t seen his
baby for ﬁve or six weeks and on Monday was start-
ing another nine-day tour. A

He has lots of pep.

But it wasn’t his energy, nor his smile, nor his strik-
ing appearance, nor his wit, nor his intelligent conver-
sation that made the impression on me.

I can’t just figure out how to express it.

But later that evening, I  on the same speaking
platform as he. I sat next to him. He had just con-
cluded a Rooseveltian speech that kept a thousand peo-
ple following every twitch of his lips, when I leaned
over and sai.d, “Your father will be proud of his son to-
night.”

He szqueezed my arm and said “Thanks, fella.”

I liked this guy.

I think I’d like his dad, too.

I remember, I remember, seeing not

The Apple Sellers, on each Block—
the Beggars in a row

And Banks were failing overnight-
for they could not repay

The savings which poor people had

I remember, I remember, the Bread

We had no money—and no jobs-
and nothing much to eat

I remember, I remember, that I lost

And in those troubled times_the'r‘e

All these I do remember, all these

And yet I’m not a Sorvehead, but the

With all the punishment they’ve

College Men Advance Rapidly
In Army, Chancellor Reveals

By Fred Lange

If you are a college man and join
the army, you may become part of a
superstition.

You may become a major or a
colonel—-and fulﬁll a superstition.

During the last World war, ac-
cording to Dr. John G. Bowman,
chancellor of the University, col-
lege men who enlisted in the army
advanced rapidly, to the surprise
of other soldiers.

In fact, claimed Dr. Bowman, “it
became almost a superstition” that
college men would not remain buck
privates.

Many college men earned com-
missions and some advanced to the
rank of colonel or major in the short
period of two years after United
States entered the war.

After the war, revealed Dr. Bow-

ian, who served as hospital con-
sultant during World War I, many

college men did in the army.

Renewal of the superstition un-
der the present conscription pro-
gram is not positive, Dr. Bowman
asserted, but he is assured that col-
lege men will make their mark in
army life. He cautioned, however,
that holding a degree under the
iose of the superior ofﬁcer was a
certain method to remain a private.

College men should learn an es-
sential lesson, he advised, to work
intelligently and thoroughly. With
such a formula, he stated, advance-
ment is certain in the army or any
in other ﬁeld.

“Judging from the last war, en-
iollment in colleges will decrease
if the United States enters a war,”
remarked Dr. Bowman. Post-war
enrollment probably will show an
increase.

Dr. Bowman, who favors con-

I await the Willkie club’s answer.

Draft News H ighiights
Washington Letter

By Lewis Riley

Washington, Oct. 23.—-—A $9,000,000 appropriation
was passed last week for short engineering courses
under army direction in qualiﬁed engineering colleges
and universities . . the answer to present need for
qualified personnel, chieﬂy engineers, civil and aero-
nautic, and inspectors, which the army hopes to pro-
duce in the colleges. Short intensive courses are
planned . . designed to qualify men for specialized
engineering assignments. Army will send personnel
into colleges to conduct the thirty—two courses offered
with least possible disturbance to the ‘normal school
curriculum.

Program is strictly in line with the Army’s avowed
desire to “upset the academic calm” as little as pos-
sible. It is virtually certain that no such institution
as the Student Army Training corps . . which as-
sumed management of many colleges in 1917
will again invade the nation’s educational system.
Robert P. Patterson, assistant secretary of war, is
key man in this program. He may be addressed for
in.f'ormation at the War department here.

leges.

College students _whose numbers are called for
service under the selective service plan need not fear
“slacker” implication.s if they accept deferment. Col-
lege students are expressly deferred by congressional
action; the president has told them to stay in college;
and it is the belief of the administration that the
process of education "must continue regardless of the
intensity of the crisis. So army officials declare.

College newspaper editorial opinion on selective
service is highly conservative. Few editors condemn
or endorse conscription. They explain regulations and
let it go at that. Exceptions: Allegheny College Cam-
pus comments: “ . . we are getting ﬂabby . . . a
year in uniform ought to do us good.” To which the
W&J Red and Black replies: selective service “may
be responsible for nipping many a man’s career in the
bud . . a grand Congressional boner resulting from
war hysteria.”

A general scaling-down in non-defense expenditures
is to be looked for soon in Congress. It is not expected
to hit educational facilities as hard as some expected.
NYA will escape the hatchet.

“America and A New World Order” by Graeme K.
Howard, just off the Scribners’ press, is the best un-
biased review of American foreign policy that we’ve
seen. Naval authorities say it should be read by all
students for a background to the debate on foreign
policy.

He’s the kind of guy everybody should know some-

what, but there’s no mistaking it, he does.

Uncle Appie’s '74.
He chews tobacco. When he walks he spits tobacco
juice. When he talks he gargles it. When he sleeps he
slobbers it; before he eats he tosses it. Other times he
chaws and chaws and chaws. He doesn’t actually spit
his tobacco juice, because v  A ’  " '
Uncle Apple can’t spit. He
sort of sprays it. I think it’s
that way on account of his
tee th, or rather on account of
his no-teeth. He has an up-
per set of ten karat gold
ones but he refuses to wear
the lowers. So he just
sprays instead of spits: it
keeps his uppers in. When he 
goes to bed at night he puts ,, .  '

he won’t admit it, every once
in awhile during the night
you can hear his cud glug
and gag in his throat.

Common Sense

‘The Senator’ Objects
To the Objectors

By Gerald Ziskind

I am gratiﬁed that the recent draft registration pro-
duced relatively few cases of conscientious objectors
refusing to enroll. Mostly these recalcitrants can be
classiﬁed as eccentric, perverse, and misguided youth
who derive infantile delight from marching out of step
with the. general will. They refused to register with
seventeen‘ million other young men, although the
chances were favorable that liberal boards would ex-
empt them from active duty.

Individuality of Character
I, for one, retain a profound respect for individu-
ality of character. I admire the man who can resist
the mob, and not be stampeded by the onrushing hordes.
But there is a world of difference between the splendid
individualism of an honest objector and the self-
seeking, obstructionist tactics of publicity seekers. Why
for example, should a preacher in a nearby community
notify his local board that registration was contrary
to his religious scruples, while at the same time fur-
nishing in his statement even more information about
himself than the board sought‘? As a preacher, this
man was already exempt from active dutyin the armed
forces. But he was not satisﬁed with the generous
tage of our freedom to obstruct with thrivial bickering
tage of our freedom to obstruct wit htrivial bickering
a vital program aimed to preserve free government.
In New York, divinity students joined the crusade
of obstruction. They appeared before a jury rever-
ently chanting Bible hymns, for, it seems, religion
cloaks dissenters with privilege and immunity. I ask
these self-chosen spokesmen of religious doctrine:
“What religion forbids enrollment in a national census?”

_ These men were merely asked to enroll in order to

facilitate the classification of citizens as to their availa-
bility or non—availability for military service.

Some Fancy Logic

I hope, when the call for active duty comes, that
the conscientious objectorwill become a vestige of_‘ the
past. If anything, fervent students of God should be
the ﬁrst to join the conscripts. For is not the first
requisite for a religious life a free life? And is not this
conscript army mobilized to keep America free?

There can be no thoroughgoing conscientious ob-
jectors in this conscription. Men of conscience can not
validly object to the struggle of principle and justice
for survival. But we are a lenient and democratic peo-
ple. Therefore we will blandly accept the pleas of
protestants, believing them sincerely motivated. ..They
will be permitted to stay home and revel in triumph
over their government. But the true adherents of re-
ligion and gospel, the overwhelming majority of preach-
ers and divinity students, will ﬂock to the colors to
defend a free America.

Cross Country
Squad Drops
Three Meets

"A travel—weary and victory-hun-
gry Pitt cross country squad ﬁnal-
ly returns to the familiar hills and
dales in Schenley park this week-
end after a 2500 mile trek through
seven states in the last eight days.

Following a 19-36 thumping at
Purdue in Lafayette, Indiana Satur-
day, October 12, the Panther har-
riers lost a close 26-29 battle with
the Army on R-day at West Point.
-Coach Carl Olson’s troupe returned
in time to leave for East Lansing,
Michigan where they fell before the
nation’s outstanding cross country
aggregation, Michigan State, 19-36,
Saturday.

One ray of light glimmered
through this dark automobile ex-
cursion. That was co-captain Walt
Sterner. The slightly-built senior
star waltzed home ﬁrst in front of
the cadets in near record ﬁgures
and scored close seconds against
both the Boilermakers and Spar-

! tans.

Chief disappointment in this trio
of engagements was co-captain
Frank McCabe. A veteran and out-
standing performer of two past

campaigns, the short-legged Cora-
;opolis Comet failed to place better
'.than sixth

in any of the three
contests.

Greatest improvement was shown
in the work of Johnny Broskey, a
junior plugger who didn’t win a
berth on the traveling squad until

the ﬁnal dual contest in 1939. Stag-

ing a brilliant sprint in the closing
seconds of the race, Broskey posted
his best time at West Point.

Sophomore Marcus Allias meas-
ured up to expectations on the West
Point and East Lansing courses,
registering fourth place in the en-
tire ﬁeld in the former. Experience,
or rather lack of it, was against him
in his first test. Another sopho-
more, Bob Davis, performed capa-
bly, but as he gained his reputation
as a top-ﬂight half miler, his hill
and dale performances are more for
conditioning toward his spring mid-
dle distance running.

Jim Saunders didn’t score in
any of the three tests, a bad ankle
bothering him the entire trip.
Juniors Ben Foote and Bob Graham
accompanied the team, but lack of
preliminarv training showed up in
their work, both failing to report
for practice until a week ago.

The Pitt News

from the

Sidelines

With Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

Mr. llohcrt C. Adams. who did a nifty job of editing this sheet.
last year, sent us a letter the other day. Having forsaken the local
scene for the ivy-covered walls and halls of the Harvai'(l graduate
school, ln.-otlier Adams is now .in a. position to qualify as our I\*y
league under-cover man.

It seems, according to his letter and the newspaper clippings
which be enclosed, that several Eastern schools. notably Yale and
l*larvar(l, are having their football worries. Robert is less than
cntln1sia.<.tic over the Harvaul boys, who looked rather pitiful
against l\’licl1igan.’s Tom llaririoii and entourage.

Y ale Situation Critical

More criicial, however, is the situation at Yale. The. Monday
after Yale was nosed out by Pcnnsylvan.ia, 50-7, Ogden Miller,
chairman of the Yale athletic board of co.ntrol, stated to a meeting
of the Football \Yritcrs association that‘ Yale contemplated no
change in its athletic policy, despite the possibility of lickings
such as that adini11istcre(l by the Pcnnsylvanians.

Miller went on to say that he considered the over-emphasis of
football at some schools an unhealthv condition, but that he wn.-.'
conﬁdent that in time there will be a change to a more equitable
balaiice. In the n'1ea..nti1nc, he said, Yale will continue to treat
2il‘l1lctcs on the same basis as any other students.

All of this can scam.-el_v be rc;2'ai'<lc(l as st2ii"='Eiiig*. lt is inerely
2: l'.'i'f(‘Z‘;-lilml oi’ the ai'ﬁr1n<*(i £lllll(—‘l‘i<3 policy under _w_'uich Yale has
operat‘c(l for some time. Yale's inimcdiate troubles, and incidentally
those of several other ﬁounderiiig Eastern elevens, were neatly
smnincd up by the New York Times’ John Kicran who pointed out:
“Penn and (‘ornell have had their ups and downs in football.
'l"hey’re up now. Yale has been up, too. Now Yale is having its
downs and they are not ﬁrst downs.”

De-emphasis Woes Always Occur

Locally, Yale's woes have signiﬁcance as further indication
that you can ’t expect to change from high pressure football to
the straight and narrow path of non-subsidizatioii without running
mto a certain amount of trouble. That all such worries are not
monopolized by Oakland schools is a source of satisfaction.

It is our belief that some’ day colleges will cease to regard
football as an end in itself. \Vhen that day comes, liigl1—gearcd
_i'ootball machines will no longer be a problem. Already the trend
is away from scheduling two teams which function under funda-
mentally diﬁ:'erent codes. As a result, a large number of college
clubs are playing onl.y within their own class, and it is becoming

increasingly difficult for a team to sweep through its schedule un-
defeated.

Uneven Struggles Silly

That the practice of playing 1na1~kcdl_v superior teams is silly
has seldom been born out so deﬁnitely as it was in last Saturday
Tech-Not1'e Dame ﬁasco. The Irish scored and scored and scored
without brcakhig a sweat. Granted that Elmer Layden’s failure
to keep the totals down was not wholly ethical, the fact that Notre
Dame was able to tally so easily and with such frequence is indi-
cative of the difference between the two clubs.

’\‘v’e do not feel that the absence of subsidization will iiccossarilv
result in the reformists l)e'<:o1i1.i1‘1g‘ class ‘) powers, but‘ we do knoxiv
that the subsidized schools, year in and _vcal' out, will turn up with
better elevcns. The only way to escape possible humiliation such
as that heaped upon Tech, is to drop the power schools froin the
schedule. Merely calling names won ’t accoinplish anythin,c-.

it I Dian of the Week

This is the fourth in the series,
Sports Man of the Week. Each
Wednesday throughout the year the
man who has contributed most to
University athletics during the past

‘week will be honored. This 'week’s

selection. is:

TED KONETSKY——Only three
year starter on the squad, rangy
“TK” is Pitt’s ﬁrst all-season ﬁeld

« captain in years.
And the ﬁrst four
games proved
that C h a r l e y
B o w s e r knew
what he was do-
ing when he ap-
pointed Ted. The
big Kappa Sig,
out most of last
year with in-
juries, has played
like an all-Amer-
ican this fall.

Last Saturday

 

Konetsky was
one of the few bright spots in
Pitt’s performances. He did a ﬁne

job at tackle under the most dis-
L.::-ui'aging circumstances, and pre-
vented a ﬁve yard penalty late in

the game when he waved back sev-
eral Pitt substitutes. Had the subs
come in at the time. the Panthers
would have penalized for excessive
times out. No other member of the
Pitt squad felt the Ram defeat more
than did Konetsky, and the hats
are off to him, a grand captain, a
grand tackle, and a grand guy.

WAA
Jottings

By Harriet Harris

According to Adele Yorio, presi-
dent of Women’s Athletic associa-
tion, the week-end of October 18
and 19 spent at Grove City college
was “simply marvelous.” Miss Yo-
rio, together with Jeannette Lloyd,
lid-42; Ruth Mendoza, C43; Gail
Brendlinger, BA41, and Berry Rhet-
myer, faculty adviser, represented
W AA at the AFCW convention.

This convention is an annual event
of the Athletic Federation of Col-
lege Women. The organization
played hostess to all the colleges of
Western Pennsylvania and to a few
schools from the rest of the state.

As an opener on the program
tzlanned for the representatives to
the convention, the girls were taken
on a three-mile hike along the Alle-
gheny river. After that they were
given a chance to test their skill at
trap shooting and target practice.
They spent Friday evening “swing-
inc? their partners” at a very enjoy-
able barn dance. Our representa-
tives left Saturday morning in order
to be home in time to see the Pitt-
Fordham football game.

Kaps.

Jack Glenn, all intramural half-
back, will be the man to ‘watch. In
this, his ﬁnal year of competition,
hewill attempt to even outdo his
previous IF feats. Johnny Tyber-
ski, speedy halfback of the Phi
Kaps, should be on the receiving
end of most of Glenn’s passes.

The Phi Games will depend upon
“Stoney” Bitner and Paul MacNeill,
holdovers from last year’s powerful
team. Finding a passer to take the
place of Chris Watson is the Fijis’
chief worry.

Pi Lambda Phi opposes the seven
man team from the SAM house at
4 o’clock on ﬁeld 2. This game will
show the maximum in gridiron riv-
alry with speedster Larry Katz lead-
ing his team in the absence of the
at-long-last-graduated Bert Jaffe.
Hilliard Kreimer bulwarks the Pi
Lam defense.

The Neville street gang will have
triple-threat “Red” Silverman in
the tailback spot. Outside of the
sophomore star, they have no other
outstanding veteran back from last
year.

Dr. W’hitney, Graham Will Talk
At Conference of Journalists

The City of Pittsburgh and the University will act as hosts to the
the ﬁfteenth annual convention of the Pennsylvania School Press associa-
tion on Friday and Saturday. Foster Memorial and the Cathedral will be
centers for sectional clinics of the state-wide scholastic group.

tendent. of Pittsburgh schools and

urday while attending the confer-
ence,” Miss Harris stated “Staff
members of college yearbooks, mag-
azines, and newspapers will find the
informal meeting for the collegiate
press group in the lecture room of
Foster Memorial hall on Friday at
_4:l5 o’clock particularly interest-
mg.”

All those interested in college
yearbooks are urged to visit 8 Ca-
thedral where a large exhibit of
yearbooks will be on display both
on Friday and Saturday.

Following greetings’ from Dr.
Whitney, and the 'president’s words
of welcome, Anna Jane Phillips of
the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette will
speak on “The Experience of a Wo-
man Reporter.” W. Russell Schull,
director of the National forum, will
speak after Miss Phillips.

Friday evening’s calendar calls
for a swimming party, a dinner, and
a meeting in Foster Memorial, at
which Mr. Graham will deliver an
address. A dance at Webster Hall
hotel w:ill conclude the day’s activ-
ities.

Saturdays main feature will be
a talk on “News Through Cartoons”
by Cy Hungerford of the Post-
Gazette. Miles Bouton, foreign cor-
respondent, will speak at this morn-
ing session.

In the afternoon, following sev-
eral sectional clinics, John L. Mor-
rison, editor of the Greenville Rec-
ord-Argus, will address the mem-
bers at the convention banquet. Al-
so at the banquet C. Gloria Paul,
contest director of PSPA, will award
prizes to winners of student-writ-
ten material and to publications.

At 2 o’clock the group will attend

Eichelborgcr Sees European
Revolt if Ilitler Armies Full

Warning that there would be no
just peace if Hitler won, Clark M.
Eichelberger, national director of
the Committee to Defend America
by Aiding the Allies, predicted “that
all of Europe would revolt if Ger-
many were handed a military de-
feat,” in a talk delivered Monday
before Pitt Town Meeting.

“The tragedy of today,” he la-
mented in his talk, “International
Problems in American Foreign Pol-
icy,” “could have been avoided if
America had joined the League of
Nations and if other nations had
fulﬁlled ' their ‘obligations to the
League.”

Eichelberger, who is also national
director of League of Nations asso-
ciation, visited Pittsburgh this week
in a four-part program which in‘-
cluded talks not only for the Town
Meeting but also before the Hun’-
gry club, the Community ‘ forum,
and as a representative of his com-
mittee, America’s foremost advo-
cate for material aid to the Allies.

As a veteran of the last World
war, he expressed the hope that the
youth of America would not have to
enlist for another war, but, he com-
mented, “This is not the time for
war, but I do think that we should
rather go to war than let British go
down.”

The American people have been
"fortunate, in the opinion of Mr.
Eichelberger, in getting over their
Maginot line complex which made
them believe that the ocean was a
formidable barrier enough to keep
off enemies. “France learned its

lesson too late.”

“Our defense and the defense of
Britain are identical,” he pointed
out as he stressed that the United
States should continue supplying
war goods to England, even if she
were forced to dig into Fort Knox
and give Britain a billion or two
of our gold.

“If, with our help, England wins,
perhaps we may have a just peace.
Germany would be certain to give
us an injust peace as we have seen
from the actions of the pompous,
posing, ridiculous, strutting mad-
menuof Europe.”

Mr. Eichelberger expressed his
belief that the United States and
Britain would have to patrol the
world after the war. His" commit-
tee believes that both nations would
have to rebuild the world after the
conﬂict.

“However,” he said in closing,
“the world a thousand years from
now will look back and admire
heroic England who defended dem-
ocracy from that tight little isle
across the Channel.”

Metropolitan Opera
Quartet Presents

Concert in Syria

By Jean Garland

The May Beegle concert series
opened in grand style Friday even-
ing in Syria Mosque with a premiere
performance featuring the Metro-
politan Opera quartet in its initial
Pittsburgh appearance.

Included in the quartet were Rose
Bampton, soprano; Helen Olheim,
contralto; Charles Jullman, tenor,
and Julius Huehn, baritone.

Containing many arias, duets, and
trios, the all-operatic program was
highlighted by generous encores.
The ensemble singing, an added fea-
ture, was especially effective in
Mozart’s “Quartette from Cosi fan
Tutti,” but was blighted when Miss
Bampton outsang her colleagues.
Julius Huehn, a native of Pitts-
burgh, received a hearty home-
welcome for his singing of the dra-
matic “Credo” from Verdi’s master-
piece, “Othello.”

Charles Kullman, lyric tenor, was
equally impressive in an aria from
“Andrea Chenier” and in a humor-
ous style of “Mother Hubbard,” a la
Handel. Miss Bampton was splen-
did in her singing of the aria from
Verdi’s “La Forza de Destino.” Miss
Olheim and the accompanist, Stu-
art Ross, also gave commendable
performances.

If the University were to announce that all stu-
dent publications cease, the student body would be
quick to rise and protest. Student publications here
at Pitt, just as anywhere in America, are dependent on
the students themselves. They must edit, they read

and they support.

The success of student publications, financially,
directly depends upon the students. The money paid
by the student for his copies is trifling compared to
the cost of running the individual magazine or news-
paper. The important source of revenue comes from
advertising, national and local.

Local merchants are always willing and ready
to advertise as long as they feel their advertisements

are

beiiig observed, arid acted upon. Wily not intake it

pl?'.1.T)T§(',.;‘-.‘i'tl0ilS.,, as well as T.00iil]’lg into the services and

cations.
