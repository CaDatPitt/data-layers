three additional schools

student demand to include the Schools of Dentistry, Medlclnes and Phal’

ma cy.

Application cards, similar to those which may be had at the 1-..’I‘0U7nd
ﬁoor lobby booth, the Mens’ and Womens’ Health Serviceiofﬁces, the ‘rlvl
and YWCA headciuarters, and the ofﬁcjes"ofethe:dean of men and ,the _-dean
of women, have been sent to these schools, and according to Dr. H. C.

Carlson, director of Men’s Health
Service, -“the response already is
more than satisfactory.”
These application cards, explains
Dr. Carlson, in no way obligate the

student, since they are only an in- _

dication of his intention to sub-
scribe, to the plan.

There is no payment connected
with signingone of these applica-
tion cards now’, as the $2.50 fee will
be collected by the University at
registration next fall.

The ﬁnancial beneﬁts of the plan
was used as the theme of an ad-
dress to Inquiry Forum Monday by
Walter Rogers, representative of
the Hospital Service Association of
Pittsburgh. _

Fine local hospital A

Reducing the problem of hospital-
ization to its simplest terms, Mr.
Rogers said:

“Here in VVestern Pennsylvania
we have excellent hospital equip-
ment and an extremely well-trained
hospital personnel. Our hospitals
are known throughout the country
for their ﬁne work.”

“Yes, in Western Pennsylvania,
thousands of people, because of the
suddenness with which large hos-
pital. bills strike, cannot take» ad-
vantage of these :l':ac.ilities. Group
hc.spital1'zation is simply a method
of bringing the people and the hos-
pitals together in times of need
without too great a stress upon per-
sonal ﬁnances.”

Constructive step

 Congratulating the Pitt News and
Mens’ Studtntl-lealth Service upon
their sponsorship of the group hos-
pitalization plan Mr. Rogers label.-
led the drive “a constructive step;

Graduate division announces

With the closing of the school year, the Research Bureau for Retail
Training announces the resignation of two staff members, Miss Edith
J amieson, instructor in textiles, and William J. Pilat, professorof retailing.

Miss-Jamieson is_ to assume a position with the Lux Technical insti-

tute, a privately endowed school
for girls in San Francisco which
provides training for vocational po-
sitions. According to Miss Jamie-
son, “Since there is no other school
like it in San Francisco, nor has
there been anything of its kind
there before, the ﬁeld is rich in op-
portunity.”

Mr. Pilat announce that he has
resigned to become a partner in the
Russell W. Allen company, indus-
trial engineers and retail consult-
ants. In his new position, Mr. Pilat
will concentrate on the continued
development of a research program
used in stores throughout the coun-
try.

are John A. Garber. instructor in
advertising and -Fred A. Egmore,
Jr., instructor in merchandising.
lV[r. Garber, a Harvard graduate,

Students and staff of the Research

Bureau for Retail Training will at-

tend an informal dinner at the Fac-

o’clock. The dinner will be their
last social get-together of the year.

The guest speaker for the affair
will be Theodore Kahn, publisher
of the Boy’s Outﬁtter. Mr. Kahn,
together with a committee of three
men from New York will award
prizes to those students who have
submitted the bestw~a.dvertising and

porters at a time when it is most
needed. . . . '
Following the address, an infor-

mal seminar session on hospitaliza— .

tion was held. Led by M13 R0g€1‘S

and Dr. Carlson, the discussion cen- ,

tiered around the relationship of the
plan to the individual subscriber.
The following services will be

available to students under the
plan:
(1) R-o_or,n and board in ward ac-

commodations for a total of 21 days
each school year in any of Pitts-
bugh’s 25 largest hospitals.

The student may select accom-
modations in semi—private or pri-
vate rooms with an allowance of $3
per day toward the purchase of
these better accommodations.

(2) Use of the operating room
as often as necessary.

(3) Anesthesia as often as nec- _
cssary. ‘

Points two and three are out-
standing benefits in the proposed
University plan, since many other
hospitalization plans call for the
use of the operating room facilities
and anesthesia only once during a
conﬁnement.

(4) Ordinary drugs and medi-
cations. ’

(5) Necessary dressings and

casts.
(6) Routine laboratory services.
(7) Ordinary X-ray.

Halloran opens
Memorial. drive

Members of the Committee will
tuck packages of cards into their
pockets and approach seniors for
Senior Memorial pledges, reveals
Tom Halloran, BA, chairman of the
committee.

The response of the seniors has
not been very great, declares Hal-
loran, and the committee thinks
that personal contact will thorough-
ly acquaint seniors with the memo-
rial and the importance of contribu-
tion.

Last year’s graduating class did

not receive enough money to pay for ,

their prospective gift to the Univer-
sity.

lallnran feels conﬁdent, however,
that the class of 1940 will not per-
mit Senior Memorial plans to “fall
through” because of lack of sup-
port.

An editorial rider
to the SFA report

A record of SFA activities for the year appears
in th issue under the heading of “Annual Repo1't
of the President.‘ of Student-Facult_v Association.”
 a report it is not illuminating. It is little more
than a log of the student-faculty legislature. It

'We had hoped to see recommendations of some
speciﬁc, important, and vital new projects in this
report. Since what we consider to be mimysr rec-
,()l.l1ll1€lldallO1lS only were forthcoming, we are at-
taching an editorial rider to the precis on p>.1f_};e
four.

The News would like to have next year group
in'«.resti.gate the following possibilities:

1. Student. co-operative cafeterias providing
students with a more varied menu at cost prices
rather than the ‘present. system where the cafe-
terias are sub—let to concessionaires.

2. Student co-operative book store designeitl
to furnish students with new text books and sup-
plies at cost prices.

3. Establishment of a forum which would
bring to Pitt nationally known speakers.

These are but a few new projects which should
be considered by the new student and faculty as-
sembly if this group really has the interest‘ of the
'general.student body at heart. Of course, we are
familiar with objections that would be immediately
introduced. The first two points would. be -de-
scribed as “outside the scope of SFA,” the third
would be met with “no money.” These argu-
ments we reject.‘ I ~

The sphere of action of SF.A-—-always a vague

area, to be sure—-should not be ‘limited to boundar-
ies unconsciously set by previous SFA assemblies.
This year ’s group, by sponsoring such movements
as the Harrisburg protest and the football ban-
quet, has blazed the trail for the Pitt student-
faculty “legislature” to go exploring in the realms‘
of what are called new University projects.

The Cusick report‘ shows not only a need for
more new projects but also a tightening up of old
functions. The buildings and grounds coininittee
this year found no substitute for the practice of
eating on the eighth ﬂoor steps—we do not know
u'l1_e.tl1er..t;1* not? they even, investiigated t-hits the so-
cial committee has not solved’ the riddle of provid-
inginexpensive evening da.nces at Pitt, although
the’ post-football game dance was a step in the
right direction; the statistics committee’s report
sp,-ea__ks for its own condemnation—taking but one
poll i‘i.he’ileiatire year; and the perennial problem
facing every “big name” dance cl1airman——that
of making his affair break even——still has to be
met, especially after this year when three out of
the four SFA dance chairmen ended up in the red.

The boys who h.ave been around for some time
say that the retiring SFA is one of the best here
for years. This we do not dispute.

The point we make is that an organization,
'blessed with so much leeway as a combined student
faculty assembly, can do much more for the aver-
age student at Pitt than mere routine functions.

Vile hope that m.ore attempts in this direction
will be mirrored in the report of next year’s as-
scmbly.

Weak, tea
 The 2.vhy’s and whereforrfs
 of J. Ganuff, criminal

By Kal Kalwary

In Mr. William Randolph Hearst’s daily stint, In the
News ‘(.’3.—*C0lLll’nl1 which Mr. Hearst, for reasons of his
own, does not sign), he writes that crime is the biggest
business in America, and that it ﬂourishes because
pm.rent::.; are lax, public enemies are gloriﬁed and the
,r_»a>:'n'I.<_e system is deplorable.

’.'l.‘l:us cliaige is probably true . . as far as it goes.
But if deﬁnitely does not go far enough. Joe Ganulf
riex/e.r' entered a life of crime for the sheer pleasure of
getting his name into print, or to test the parole system.
liiiz: {f)E1.1’.‘6)l1lIS might have _spoiled him. But very few Joe
(3‘.«;in.u.ffs are allowed enough head to ﬁnd out that crime
does pay. , .

One thing, and only one" thing, creates Joe Ganuffs.
(It. is taken for granted that I am excepting the men-
tzrllly crippled.) Crime is traced, and easily, to the
econonntc makeup of this country. Criminals are the
rrafzural children of our economy.

Mr..;,.Hearst ignorescthe real source of -all evil, and
poi,x1ts.rth;e,.;.ﬁngei'..of guilt at the secondary causes al-
r'.e:‘1‘dfv mentioned, and the government. Italy, he tells
us, was once the world’s laboratory for blackmail, gun-
nery, bombing, etc. But Mussolini and his Black Shirts
suppressed the “Black Hand” organizations. Musso-
li 1.':.«i.’:§ shootings and castor oil treatments are preferred,
by the newspaper magnate, to the federal government’s
orde::'ly execution of the law. V

The idea is: a man with I1 Duce’s oomph should
be in complet-e control of the FBI; have the unques-
'i:?m;1ed. 1‘ authorilty to “attack organized crime and mete
out «punishment to suit his mood of the day. And it
follows, that courts of justice would automatically fade.

T'l"1'lS system, according to Patriot Hearst, would solve
the 'country-wide crime problem. But of unearthing
@s‘.m,'l())_”(llC evils, he says nothing. It is all rather dis-
lsveartening to see such rot published and distributed,

‘espec.ia'lly“i'n th'is’day, when any boy or girl in the teens
can. explain that Joe Ganuff raids a liquor store for
‘nxoney, or the means with which to acquire money.

Why does Joe Ganuff resort to this method of ob-

't:n'.n.lug a. breakfast, an automobile or an appendectomy?
Berziause other methods seldom show proﬁts for the
‘or<li_n.1:r;y man. He can hardly be expected to compete
'v;r‘i:t.h.. those who “know” the mana'ger, or those whose
uua3.es are vice_,-presidents of the company, or those who
‘inlrlerit trust funds. Even a sociology professor will con-
ﬁrm what I have" said. '

We students should not forget the last world war;
in fact it should occupy the foremost attention of the
student, for the last world war is the only speciﬁc act
by which students can judge the leaders of today’s
world.

We got one thing from the last war: a complete dis-
trust of the words ‘ﬁght for democracy,’ because we
did not ﬁght for democracy. We fought to keep the
English imperialist nation ahead of the rising im-
perialist nation of Germany. You’ll get few historians,
economists, and social scientists who disagree with this
interpretation of the world war.

The result of the world war was completely opposite
the publicly expressed promises of the leaders. The
result was a partition of Europe so that it would be im-
possible for any one on the continent to arise and chal-
lenge England’s empire. And Germany’s colonies were
taken from her. This was unsuccessful. Why should
we trust the English? Because their lies are in the
same language as our own?

The point I’m trying. to make is that we can’t trust
the English "or the French or even the American Gov-
ernment to make any kind of a satisfactory peace. If
we should go to war to help Democracy ﬁght Fascism
we already have three strikes on us. That’s a hell of
a way to start a ball game; especially if there is a
chance of getting kil1ed.——J. deB., C42.

Commentary on abundance
of mongering for war

Mongering——-either the war or peace——style, depend-
ing on the critics’ nationality, has been a favorite brand
of so—called diplomats during the past few years. Only
recently has a new phenomenon appeared on the inter-
national horizon-—speech-mongering.

The eyes and ears of the nation have been bom-
barded especially during the past few days with this
new brand of excitement: Churchill pleads for victory
and assault Sunday afternoon; Roosevelt pleads for peace
through preparation for war Friday afternoon-—followed
up by Eleanor Saturday morning; Lindbergh, the Mys-
terious, predicts reaction to defense, Sunday night.

This new life of 1940: neglecting overdue themes for
news bulletins, lunching over “the complete text of
the Prime Minister’s speech follows . .,” running for
the ﬁnal editions—only glamorizes the current interna-
tional bugaboos, only strengthens war mindedness.

These speeches are ﬁne; some of the best written in
years, eloquent, inspiring, exciting. The big Brains have
found solutions: Churchill would have his people save
their liberties by losing their lives; Roosevelt suggests
the people save their lives by, perhaps. losing their
liberties. If only the small brains could answer. If
only the small Brains could speech-monger for their
own 1iberties.—E. J. B., C42.

Discusses American Collegian
of a recent editorial

It was good to learn that the American Collegian is
not being stampeded by the excitement of the day. That
sounds good. It probably. sounded good in Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and Norway a few months
or years back to know that Germany’s threats were so
much wind. England and France also found that “it
never rains, but oh how it pours!” P Little Finland bore
the brunt of an aggressive nation’s expansion policy.
Hitler has all Europe in a fearful dither with his light-
ning thrusts and blitzkriegs. A i" A

There is not one nation in Europe that feels secure
today. The allies have been good spectators, but so far
Hitler has ‘taken everything he started after. I believe
our President knew what he was talking about when he
said that Hitler is aiming at,a world conquest. Should
Europe fall before a mad, ruthless genius, where would
America be? With Germany, Russia, and perhaps Italy
and Japan, as allies, United_States would be right in the
middle, caught between mo ﬁres. Let Europe ﬁght its
own battles, but let the leaders of our own country learn
that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
If the war comes over here,‘ itiwould be better to be
prepared for it. We might as well do something while
we are waiting the outcome. Our national and natural
defenses might not be as impregnable as we believe.
It’s fun to be fooled, 'but,§‘-it’s muchibetter to know.

P. G., C43‘.

When Germany Wins

Hope for continued peace in the United States after
Germany ﬁnishes the conquest of Europe rests on sev-
eral factors. One is that Germany may be in a weak-
ened condition, particularly if the war lasts any length
of time. Another is that Russia and Germany seem
doomed to eventually clash with each other.

A factor that has been given little consideration is
that, while most of the countries invaded by Germany
so far have been small and historically with l.ittle na-
tional independence, England and France historically
have been independent and would be extremely 'diﬁ‘i‘-
cult to hold in subjugation for any length of time.-—W. A

Suggests errors
in ‘hospital plan’
Editor, The Pitt News:

It is not the purpose of this let-
ter to condemn the proposed hospi-
talization plan. It is however to
claim that commercialized group
hospitalization should be considered
a last resort to be used only in des-
peration. In as much as the News
has been working hard to “sell” the
plan to the University students it
has, either tactfully or unknowing-
ly, omitted some features of the
plan, which should be made known
to the student body.

Further study warranted

The “reduced” rate of ﬁve dollars
for nine months, offeredstudents,
amounts to fifty-two cents ' per
month, only ﬁve cents per month
less than the cost of the same serv-
ice offered older people working in
industry. Since the money .is.to be
collected at a rate of $2.50 each se-
mester, the five cent reduction is
probably based on the savings of
the cost of monthly collections——
the practice used by other groups.
It is apparent that no consideration
was made for the fact that the
death rate for persons of the same
age not in college is eight times as
high. Statistics on industrial risk
were not contrasted to the much
lower accident rate found among
students. It is, therefore, obvious
that the rate is not a fair one.

The most important ﬂaw in the
plan is that all students will not be
covered. Probably those students
needing “insurance” most will be
those who can least afford it, and
the last to suhscribe. The answer
to that is forced subscription to the
plan. The plan is an important
one. It will provide a service need-
ed by every student. However, by
forcing the issue the University of-
ﬁcials will be laying themselves
open to undesirable criticism.

Not a fair vote

It becomes clearer that the whole
problem warrents considerable
study. What is the rate of student
hospitalization? What shall. be con-
sidered a fair rate to pay for insur-
ance‘? Should the participating stu-
dents be provided with a mutual

plan at a great saving, or should a‘

private commercial company carry
the risk? Should the program pro-
vide for medical care in addition to
the more or less basic costs of hos-
pitalization? Certainly no one
should endorse such an important
issue before he has more to go on
than the sales talk of the agent of a
commercial agency. )

Personally, I feel that if a
thorough study is made of all the
facts, there will rise a student hos-
pitalization agency, controlled and
managed by some student group.
This -group “could ‘demand ~. enforced
subscription without criticism to the
University. and at a minimum cost
to the student.

Pitt tennis squad ends season
against Grovers this afternoon

Netters seek seventh
win in twelve starts
in ﬁnale on home clay

Eager to close the 1940 tennis
campaign well above the .500
mark, Pitt’s netmen engage
‘Grove C‘it._v’s racquetcers this
afternoon on the home clay.

This afternoon ‘s clash, the sec.-
ond of the season between the rival
court crews, will end the year’s net
activity for the Panthers, who have
won six ofyeleven matches to date.

Flushed b recent victories over
Carnegie Tech, Geneva’s previous-
ly-undefeated Covenanters, and In-
diana State Teachers, the Cathedral
batsmen are confident of repeating
their 5-4 triumph‘ registered over
the Grovers at Grove City three
weeks ago. The Grovers have been
faring none too well lately, losing
decisively, to Geneva twice, 7-2
and 8-1.

Only their number one man, Bea-
ver county titleholder and former
'Western Pennsylvania junior champ
George McCloskey, can be rated
among the top-flight collegiate net-
ters. The rest of the lineup is dot-
ted with mediocre veterans. Mc-
Closkey lost to captain Joe Kristu-
fek in their initial clash this year,
but only after a torrid three-set
Ibattle.

Fresh from grabbing the city’s
collegiate tennis championship by
-downing Carnegie Tech, the Panth-
ers went on to trip heavily-favored
Geneva, 6-3, last Saturday. Ac-
cording to comparative scores, the
‘Covenanters should have breezed
past Pitt and closed the campaign
with a spotless record.

JOE KRISTUFEK

On Monday the Panthers-extend-
ed their winning streak to three
straight by tripping Indiana State
Teachers’ hapless netmen, 6-3. Pitt
had little difficulty in breezing past
the " eachers, taking most of the
mE.":!“F-s an two sets by comfortable
margins.

In the singles, Kristufek downed
Killen, 6-1, 6-2; Goehring defeated
Brune, 6-1, 6-2; ‘w/Veiss. lost to Mar-
ley, 6-1, 11-9; Gaenger lost to Gar-
ber, 6-4, 6-3; Martin trounced Hogg,
6-0, 6-2; and Nickeson defeated
Jamison, 6-3, 6-4.

In the doubles Kristufek and
Goehring took Killen and Marley,
6-2, 6-1; Weiss and Gaenger slip-
ped past Brune and Garber, 6-2,
4-6, and ,6-4; and I-Iogg and Jami-
son edged Martin and Nickeson, 4-6,
6-1, and 6-2.

Kristufek will climax
long careerin‘ match
with ace of visitors

Joseph Kristufek, C40, will leave
behind one of the best individual
marks in Pitt tennis history when
he ﬁnishes his last set in today’S
match with Grove City.

Captain the past two years, Krist-
ufek has been the only real-top
notch performer, to swing a racquet
for the Blue and Gold since the
days of Bob Madden. Playing in the
tough number one position, he has
scored the only Pitt points on more
than one occasion. He might well
be termed the only bright spot in
the dark days of Pitt tennis.

Although devoting all his varsity

— activity to the court game his junior

and senior years, he has been a
great all—around athlete. In his
freshman year he won numeralswin
cross country, basketball, track, and
tennis. After another whirl at cross
country and track his sophomore
year he hung up his spiked shoes.

Intramural horseshoes
reach final eliminations

Horseshoes reaches a climax in
intramural sports this week as the
ﬁnal lap of -a mediocre season shows
ﬁve fraternities battling for top po-
sition.

With only a ﬂew games separat-
ing Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma
Delta, Pi Lambda Phi, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and Pi Kappa Alpha, this
week’s schedule should produce a

Pitt cindermen lower marks

Olson coached men

Although" the Pitt track squad
failed to establish any new Univer-
sity recorded‘in:the glittering‘ tri-
umph over Michigan, several marks
approached University peaks and
added to the long list of top ﬂight
rurformances the Panthers have re-
corded during Carl Olson’s eight-
year tenure as head coach.

Latest marks to fall were the 220-
yard dash and 220-yard low hurdle
standards. Frank Ohl, the flying
senior, and Hap Stickel, the sopho-
more who continually confounds
the opposition, respectively, posted
new marks in these events last
Tuesday when the Pitt squad
downed Ohio State 73-58.

In both instances the times re-
corded by this great speed duo
were the best efforts turned in by
any athlete in the country in his
respective event. Ohl reeled
off a furlong in 20.7 se-conds,
one-tenth of a second better than
the 20.8 turned in by Clyde Jeffrey
of Stanford and Barney Ewell of
Penn State, and three-tenth of a
second better than the old Univer-
-sity standard.

When Stickel skimmed over the
low hurdles in 23 seconds ﬂat, he
cut nine-tenths of a second from
Kenny Ryden’s University record of
23.9 seconds. The remarkable part
-of this performance is the fact that
not another low-timber topper in
the nation has bettered it. Freddie
‘Wolcott of Rice and Art Laret of
Southern California are the only
men who have even approached it.

Ohl added his name to. the Uni-

continue to enter hall of fame

verslty record list for the seventh
time. He holds the broad jump ti-
tle at 24 feet 1 inch and shares
ﬁve relay marks. Stickel has part
honors in two relay standards. All
University standard bearers except
three have been established by Ol-
son-coached spike—wearers. ’
Only the 100 yard dash, discus
throw and pole vault remain from
the pre-Ol.son era. All three of
these have been in jeopardy this
season and may fall before the year

is over. Stickel’s 9.8 second cen-
tury at Ohio lacked but one-tenth

of a second of equalling Pete Bow- «

en’s 9.7.

Dusty Rhoades has twice missed
breaking the 13 foot 71/2 inch mark
held by Vic Pickard in the pole
vault. Johnny Bazyk and Ted
Konetsky both have bettered the
old discus standard of 147 feet in
practice sessions and are due to let
the platter slip past Gibby We1ch’s
best distance any time.

Golfers to battle
Grove City again

Pitt’s golfers return to the links
today in an effort to snap a four-
game losing string. They meet
Grove City, one of the few Panther
victims this season.

The lineup for today’s match
will probably show Kramer and
Kennedy, «Seybold and Reis, and
Geyer and Glenn, the same six that
lost to Navy last Saturday.

Kramer and Kennedy were the
only members of the sextet. who
were able to salvage victories as the
Panthers dropped ther fourth con-
secutive match at Annapolis, 7-2.

Geyer, Reis, Seybold, and Glenn
each lost his match by a close score.
The Middies also cleaned up on all
three best balls.

photo ﬁnish for the fraternities.

Pi Lambda Phi is the current
leader with a record of 42 wins
against six losses. They have one
serious contender yet to play, the
Fijis, and a loss will prove disas-
trous to the latter’s championship
chances. The Pi Lams’ winning
combination has featured Bert En-
gelsburg and Arnie Levine.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, second
place occupant, has played two
matches less than the leading Pi
Lams. Their record shows 30 vic-
tories with only six defeats. How-
ever, they have the hardest sched-
ule of the five title-chasing teams
because they must still encounter
Pi Kappa Alpha and Phi Delta
Theta.

Pi Kappa Alphas’, DeRocher and
Page have been outstanding in the
team’s drive. DeRocher rates as
one of the standout tossers in in-
tramural ranks. Their chances of
advancement from their present
third place spot rest on coming
matches with Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and Phi Gamma Delta.

Fourth and ﬁfth spots are held by
Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Delta
Theta respectively. The Fijis bank
their hopes on Joe Roberts and
Grosset.

Ferris and Defoe make up the
twosome that has compiled the Phi
Delts’ record of 23 wins and 13
losses. The Phi Delt championship
hopes rest on the performances of
the other four teams as they have
only one big obstacle to overcome,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

Finals in- this I-F horseshoe race
will be reached tomorrow.

Outing Club closes
activities for year
with picnic May 25

Under the combined leadership of
its incoming and retiring oﬁicers,
the Outing Club of WAA will hold
a picnic at North Park, May 25 from
10 until 5 o’clock.

Jane Musser, C42. chairman of
the affair, has arranged a program
of mushball, hiking, tennis, bicy-
cling, and other sports. Assisting
her will be Dorothy Skrak, C43,
who is in charge of food and re-
freshments.

Tickets are priced at 35 cents,
which includes food and transpor-
tation, and may be secured from
either a newly elected or past of-
ﬁcer.

Trackers seek fifteenth straight
against Temple in IC-AA tuneup

With Southern California deﬁn-
itely out of the IC-4A meet next
week, the Pitt track and ﬁeld ag-
gregation will point towards Boston
in the ﬁnal tune-up engagement
against Temple at Philadelphia, this
week-end.

The Temple team promises little
in the way of formidable opposition.
and regardless of any unknown
quantities they may have, the
Panther win chain is scheduled to
forge its ﬁftieth straight link. After
trimming Michigan, the squad has a
perfect letdown before the ICAAAA
meet at Cambridge, May 31 and
June 1. _ .

Although’ the Pitt victory Satur-
day showed three great individual
performaers in Hap Stickel, Frank
Ohl, and Johnny }3azyk,. the whole
team turned in brilliant perform-
ances. The second and third place
men who came through with the
chips dowwn counted heavily.

Bazyk, the husky senior weight
star who has contributed to Pitt
victories for three years, while out-
standing runners, have drawn the

licity, never had his work more
appreciated than last‘ Saturday at
Ann Arbor. _

With only the mile relay and the
discus throw left on the program
the score stood 61-56. A first place
in the discus would cinch the meet
for Pitt. The Brooklyn giant tossed
the platter two feet beyond Bob
Ostroot for ﬁrst place and a ﬁrst in
the meet. He had already copped
the shot put. I I ’

Then Al Boulanger’s return to
form was a dominant factor in the
Panther triumph. He ran the fast-
est mile of his collegiate career,
4:242. as Ed Barrett, Michigan star
played right into his hands.‘ Bar-
rett made the fatal mistake of set-
ting a pace that permitted Boulang-'
er to unwind his capable legs for
his tremendous last quarter kick.

Dave McDowell also looked more
like his old self as he cleared six
feet three inches, his. best effort
since indoor season.

University plans Stadium
Commencement June 12

ln case of rain ceremonies will take place

in Commons Room, Soldiers, Sailors Memorial
In case of rain on commencement day, June 12, twin ceremonies will
take place in Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial Hall and the Commons Room

of the Cathedral, it was revealed this week.

Otherwise, commencement

will be held, as usual, in the University Stadium.
Undergraduate schools—Col1ege. Engineering, Mines, Business Ad-
ministration, and Education—will hold exercises in Soldiers’ and Sailors’

Memorial Hall, and ceremonies for
professional and graduate schools
are scheduled to t.ake place’ in the
Commons Room.

_ This was announced in the book-
let. of, instructions sent out to sen-
iors. , . _

With reference to invitations to
the “bad weather” ceremonies, the
booklet explains:

“Because of the limited space
available, only two tickets for
these exercises can be provided for
each senior, which may be obtained
when those for the Stadum are is-
sued at the offices of the various
schools. The only “rain tickets”
available will be those assigned to
the graduating seniors.” _

Commencement will begin at 9:30

o’clock on Wednesday morning, and
a short concert by the University
‘Band is scheduled before the actual
exercises begin. _ .
' Cap and ’gawn will be worn by
every graduate in the academic pro-
cession, and candidates for all pro-
fessional and graduate degrees will
wear their hoods. If commence-
ment is not held in the stadium,
there will be no academic proces-
sion.

Attendance at the exercises by
the graduates is a deﬁnite part of
commencement, and no graduate
may be absent from the ceremony
without the permission of the dean
of his school.

According to the instructions, ad-
missjon, except for those in the pro-
cession, is by ticket only. Gradu-
ating seniors may obtain tickets for
the use of their families and friends
by applying at the offices of their
schools, beginning May 27.

Other interested persons may ob-
tain tickets by applying at the office
of the Chancellor, 106 Cathedral.

tional Problems of Noctural Ani-
mals” at the next regular meeting

science fraternity, tomorrow.

The lecture will be held in 24 Ca-
thedral at 8 o’clock following din-
ner in 1017 Cathedral at 6:30
o’clock.

Dr.~Crawford has done consider-
able work on the noctural habits of
animals.

Cusick sums up

Contin.1Led' from page one

loly next May with the inward satis-
faction of leaving a job well done.
To them I recommended the con-
tinuation of most all the projects
which we carried this year: pep as-
semblies; demonstrations block;
theater committee; Senior memor-
ial; Scholar’s Day; social committee;
appointments committee; concert
hours committee; the four class
dances; and spring festival.

“The student body and faculty
can make their wants and desires
known in frequent statistics com-
mittee polls. A Closer relations with
Carnegie Tech would, in my opin-
ion, be a praise-worthy move as
would a well-planned Christmas
ceremony. As the parking problem
shows signs of becoming more acute,
special steps should be taken the
coming year to provide some solu-
tion. _Other projects inaugurated
this year deserve continuation and
enlargement——the football banquet
being a prime example.

“Faculty assistance and partici-
pation in student affairs should be
more closely sought. These men
and women, for the greater part,
have much to offer students outside
of class. The pity is that they are
at a loss as to the correct manner
in which to offer their services. The
students must seek and the faculty
must volunteer. College learning
does not end with 15 credits: ase-
mester.

“I wish to thank the Pitt News
and every other student and facul-
ty organization which worked so
willingly and long to advance the
cause of student government at the
University.

“My ﬁnal word here is a plea to
Before everything else
be loyal to your school. Do nothing
to discredit it with your fellow men
or with the outside public. Fight
everything and everybody that so
aims. Attempt always to solve your
internal problems internally. Re-
member—we are all working for the
same thi.ng—-a more glorious Pitt.”

Sincerely yours, —
PATRICK J. CUSICK. Jr.,
President SFA.

Text of report:

During the year now past the Stu-
dent-Faculty Association through its
officers and members made a very
sincere effort to secure greater stu-
dent interest and participation in
the affairs and projects of student
government which it controls. Old
projects were carried on with an eye
to providing low—cost student
amusement: originality in planning
and execution was eagerly sought.
New projects were brought forward.
Some were scrapped due to the lack
of sufiicient funds or some other

reason. Most, however, were car-
ried out “with a_ fair amount of suc-
 ‘ .-»;;~.’n:.,.;-....’_. I ;,'.z 3,

Our first real project, which took

place last spring, was the organiza-
tion of the general University pro-
test against the cut in the State ap-
propriation. Led by Gertrude
Broido and Clarence Shepard, the
drive was successful in seconding
the personal protests of the Chan-
cellor and Business Manager of the
University. The appropriation was
passed in full with an additional
amount being given to the Medical
School.

Cheering Block

. ',F.all term saw, the regular com-
mittees swing into action‘:‘

The Cheering Block functioned as
in past years at the football games.
New and novel formations and
stunts were introduced by Tom Hal-
loran and Adele Yorio. Particularly
worthy of note was the combined
block-band stunt to the tune of
“Over the Rainbow.”

Bill McElwain provided innova-
tions in carrying out the duties of
the Pep Assemblies committee chair-
man. An outdoor assembly on the
Boulevard side of the Cathedral,
enhanced by outstanding perform-
ances on the part of Roy Baldwin
and Dolly Dawn, kept Pitt spirit
solidly behind a game football team.

A successful attempt was made to
establish a friendly rivalry with
Carnegie Tech just before the an-
nual football game. .In a joint din-
ner between the representatives of
the Carnegie Student council and
Pitt student leaders the goalposts
from the game of the preceding year
were"‘='decided upon as ' the 1 (particu-
lar objects to be wagered. The
Tech student leaders remained true
to their promises when Pitt won the
game. Plans are in formation to
have the posts erected on our cam-
pus during the summer months in
preparation for the game next fall.

Directly following the football
season, the Executive Committee,
upon the suggestion of Dr. H. C.

‘ Carlson, considered and planned a

team banquet. The fraternitiestand
other campus groups gave Clarence

Insufficient funds

Shepard good support and the affair
is well on its way to becoming an
annual custom. It may, however,
become, on a more expanded form,
the particular duty of the Panther
Club.

The service committees—Social
and Appointments-—serving under
chairmen Joe Roberts and Joe Kris-
tufek, respectively, worked excep-
tionally well at their year-round
tasks.

The Appointments committee in-
terviewed and sent up men of ex-
ceptionally high caliber for appoint-
ment to dance and other committee
chairmanships by the Executive
Committee. This accounts, to a
large degree, for the success which
the class dances, Spring Festival and
Senior Announcements committee
experienced. The impartiality and
integrity of this committee in a tra-
ditionally partial job deserves par-
ticular praise.

The Social committee worked long
and hard every week of the school
year supervising the social rules and
regulations of the University. Their

Work.

Adams wins

Harvard honor

Robert Adams, C40, former editor
of the Pitt News, has received a na-
tional scholarship to the Graduate
School of Business Administration
of Harvard university.

Harvard national scholarships,
awarded on the basis of scholastic
extra-curricular activities,
aptitude for‘ business, and personal

interview, carry stipends up to
$1,000.
The national scholarship plan

was inaugurated at Harvard by
president James B. Conant in 1934
to provide a “democracy of educa-
tional opportunity.”

Picnics continue as
Mines plan frolic

Continuing its" annual custom, the
School of Mines is holding a picnic
at the South park lodge Friday.
Mushball, volleyball, and other
games are scheduled on the da.y’s
events starting at 3 o’clock. ‘

Students in the School of Mines
are invited‘ to bring guests and a
basket, of food. Dancing inthe park
lodge in the evening will conclude

ne day’s program.

CA lantern dance
promises solution
to exam scourge

Newest discoveries on the part of
passing exams with straight A’s
have proved that cramming is taboo.

The newest slant on study meth-
ods includes such disagreeable
measures as a full moon, the soft
glow of lanterns swaying in the
breeze, soft music and dancing at
the CA Lantern Night Dance this
Friday. At least that’s what the
committee says.

Statistics show that 9 out of 10
students improve their studies by
relaxation during the stress of
exams.

“Is eighty-ﬁve cents too much
to pay for a guaranteed success in
exams in addition to the most agree-
‘able road to A’s yet discovered?
Away with cramming. Be modern
and study in the newest way,” says
Matt Marshall, 42, chairman.

Dr. Samuel H. Williams, profes-
sor of biology and education, will

ner-party tonight instead of their
regular 12:30 o’clock session in the

ear’s S F A achievements

work goes largely unnoticed all year
round. It is dull and very routine,
but it must be done. Every student
is in its debt. They experimented.
also, with the idea of having tea
dances after football games. One
such. dance was held. It was only
a fair success. A detailed report is
now on ﬁle with SFA that points
out the procedure to be followed if
any such dances are to be held in
the future.

Insuﬂ‘icient funds proved the
stopper in the ambitious Christmas
Ceremony which was planned under
the supervision of Sam Whiteman
and Gertrude‘Broido. Plans had
been carried far along when ﬁnan-
cial inability caused their abandon-
ment. The plan is very feasible and
should be included from the ﬁrst in
the preparation of next year’s
budget.

Esseﬁay movies

Dave Tucker, chairman of the
Theater committee, provided the im-
petus for the successful season en-
joyed by that branch of SFA. With
a program considerably expanded
over that of the year before, the
Esseffay Theater showed to appreci-
ative audiences on a number of
Thursday afternoons throughout
both semesters. Modern movies
were very well attended. Educa-
tional ﬁlms, which were introduced
for the ﬁrst time this season, did not
meet with such an enthusiastic re-
ception. However, it may well be
pointed out that they were not com-
plete failures by ‘any means.

Set up this year to provide a
means of correlating student and
faculty opinion to Assembly action,
the Statistics committee, due to a
slow start, conducted only one poll.
This was a very complete and ac-
curate survey on the then approach-
ing Festival Week Roger Powell
presented the results in a well—writ-
ten report to the Assembly. Stu-
dent,desires, as eyidenced in this
poll, were subsequently incorpor-
ated into the Spring Festival Week
program; The «need and worth of
such a committee as a full—time
service group under an efficient, in-
terested chairman was demonstrated
adequately in this instance.

Dr. Christian Gauss, dean of the
college at Princeton university, ad-

dressed the Scholars’ Day assembly.
Bob Adams was chairman of this
occasion at which outstanding stu-
dents received recognition for at-
tainment in the ﬁeld. of scholarship.
Another project considered by this
committee and tabled due to a num-
ber of circumstances was an evening
assembly to be held in Foster Me-
morial in which all the scholastic
honoraries in the school would par-
ticipate—-this assembly to be ad-
dressed by an outstanding scholar.
Plans are already in formation for
incorporating this project into next
year’s SFA program. .

The Senior Memorial committee
is currently in the process of col-
lecting funds for the installation of
stained-glass medallions in two of
the windows of the Cathedral as a
senior class gift to the University.
Tom Halloran, chairman, and his
committee spent some time in the
selection of this gift and in the for-
mation of a plan to collect the funds.
The project shows every sign of
being a success. If it is, it will be
to succeed.

Recommendations for improve-
ments in student facilities were the
particular interest of the Buildings
and Grounds committee and its
chairman, Ted Konetsky. As indus-
trious as Ted and his committee
were, there does not appear to be
any particular demand for the con-
tinuation of this group next year.

Student concerts

Chairman of ‘the'Concert Hours’

committee was Dave Mackey. The
committee presented occasional con-
certs throughout the year. Each
was a success in quality of perform-
ance, if not in attendance. A con-
cert made up purely of student
talent was presented by Miriam
Goldstein and William Schneider.
Other programs were presented by
the Stradivarius Quartet, and Hans
Basserman. The function and inter-
est in‘ this committee increased this
year and deserves an even greater
success next semester.

Among the special tasks ap.point--
ed tomembers of the Assembly dur-
ing the year were: the conduct of a
Safety Campaign to Dave Buente,
the SFA representative to the Pub-
lications Board to Clarence Shepard,
and the SEA representative; to

The four class. dances, Freshman
(Pilgrim Prance) Dance, Sophomore
(Screwball) Hop, Junior Prom, and
Senior Dance were headed by Bob
Sullivan, Jack Stauif, Bob Shaw and
Dick Friday, respectively. All four
were planned conscientiously‘ and
well. tThe Sophomore and Junior"
Dances were very successful.

‘bad date (the \Ve'dnesday evening
before Thanksgiving).~ - The reasons
for the unusually low attendance at
the Senior Dance is still a mystery
to its chairman and committee. The
same Friday night dance the year
previous drew 400 couples; this
year’s drew only 300. Only a very
conservative budget prevented too
great a loss.

Executive group

The answer perhaps lies in the
success of Spring Festival Week.
Led by Sam Camarata and Mary
Mills this week was, thanks to fine
v.reatl'ier and an attractive program,
a memorable experience. Every
event, old and new, was well at-

tended, with t.he exception of the

last, the Senior Dance. I suppose
the students were all worn out or
penniless by Friday, evening.

On the basis of a plan to ..use the
Cathedral nationality’ rooms as the
theme of the Senior Announcements,
Bert Jaffe was appointed chairman
of that committee. Results have not
been ascertained.

I suppose I h.ave covered about
everything important. But a last
word? Presiding over every c(m<i-
mittee in SFA is the Executive Com-
mittee. Itsmembers were Dean
Amos, Dean-Lanfear, Ted Biddle,
Gertrude Broido, Nancy ' Di§b.V«f -lélcli
Hoeveler, Sam Whiteman, Clarence
Shepard and myself. ‘We debated
every move‘ this: whole year“ with
great thoroughness and interest.
The members of this committee met
every Thursday afternoon and
oftener, if necessary. All were con-
scientious. willing. and progressive.
I thank them for all they did.

For any degree of success student
government may have experienced
a‘ Pitt during the past year, the en-
tire Assembly of SFA. the facultgir,
the administration. and the student
body deserve the praise for their
sincere cooperation. It has been a
d‘i.~.;‘.'i.nct pleasure for me to serve as
.P1'e.s;ident of SFA. The job has
taught me a number of things. Fore-
most among these is the meaning
of --Pitt Spirit!

Sincerelv yours.
