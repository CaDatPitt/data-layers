peals. to her dear friend Robin
for help, who enlists his friends

JIFC Elections  
Held Last Wee};

Inter—frat'ernity» Council 7 held
elections‘ last Wednesday night,
electing Jim Groninger of Delta
Tau Delta as president.

His opponent for the president-
al position, Nick Kefal of Delta
Sigma Phi, was elected vice-pre_si-
dent.

Also chosen were: secretary,
Marty Renne, Phi Kappa Theta;
treasurer, Bill Ryder, Lambda Chi
Alpha; ﬁfth man, Carl Pepine, _Pi
Kappa Alpha. \

Among the business of the
meeting was the passing of the
Greek Week’Progra'm, which will
cost each fraternity and sorority
member $3.25. .

IFC adopted. the dues plan
which assesses each fraternity ac-

cording to the number of mem-
bers, instead of the previous ﬂat-'

rate system.

A motion proposing a -formal
dance was defeated, since IFC
felt that the social schedule was
already jammed. _ '

Written into the by—laws was
the amendment that the ‘IF Judi-
cial Committee be elected at -the
meeting following the election. of
the Executive Council.

The next meeting, scheduled

for Feb. 3, is a dinner in the SU
at which time. the new-oﬁ"icers

George Kobaly, Art’s ’62, added,
“The instructor should not be

Donna Bell, Art’s ’63, said:
“This would be a step in bettering

‘ Ted Rzeznik, Engr. ’62, said:
“I don’t know if this would be
very helpful, but it would be in-
teresting. to see “what students
think. of their teachers.”

Chuck Hall, Art’s ’63, said:

“It would help “the teacher to
know what. the students thinkof
'him' and whether they think he is
getting his point -across.”

Also Robert Zieles Engr. _’61,
said: “It .would give the teacher
a better idea of what the stu-
dents think 'of how they conduct

their class.” . _ '
Anthony Musmanno, Art’s ’63,-

said: “I think if a student eval-
uates a teacher of a course, the
teacher will be the one who bene-
ﬁts most. If he has weak points,
he can improve them, and if he
has none, he will gain personal
satisfaction.” -

Jerald F. Lowry, Art’s ’61, said,
“I would only be in favor of such
an evaluation, if this evaluation
were made by qualiﬁed students.

 

“However, it is very difficult to C.

determine which students would
be qualiﬁed to make such an ev-
aluation, if properly and sincerely
made, would be of great value to
students entering the university.”

Several other students express-
ed their .opinions‘on the possibil-
ity of conducting a student eval-
uation, of teachers and courses,
but. refused to be quoted because
they'felt' that itlwould be injuri-
ous to them. — ~

With great interests, we read

the Pitt News of Jan. 20. The

statements attributed to Woody
Turner were of such a nature that
we can hardly believe that it was
Woody Turner (the one we
know), speaking. Let us tell you
about him. I
Gained Quick Interest

He became an interested Pitt
student immediately upon enter-
ing the-university, joining numer-
ous activities. In the spring of his
freshman year, he was a driving
force in the United Independent

_Party, a group which was dedi-

cated to the cause of electing
competent people to SGA no mat-
ter what their affiliation.

This party made a ﬁne show-
ing against a strong Allied Col-
legiate Party, and Woody was
elected to the ﬁrst SGA. As ‘an
SGA member, he carried
through his strong convictions
and educated many members one
the issues involved with the
many problems which came up.

He created a Spirit Commit-
tee composed of many university
leaders, on the basic premise of
developing »a_ pride in the uni-
versity, a pride which he possess-
ed himself. '

The next year, he chose not to

giving as a reason, “lack of time,"
which was accepted: But he did
not give the reasons which ap-
peared the other day.

Last Spring; one of us (J.
Kent Jarrell) said, in announc-
ing Woody Turner as the Soph-
omore .Man-of-the-Year, “I feel
the choice is an elementary one
because there is no other man
who “has been more of a true

_ leader than Harry _Woodrutf
Turner.” That statement re-4
mains true today.

The Woody Turner of Jan. 20
said that he had declined to run-
due to “petty, political disputes”
so prevalent in the past. Woody,
you know that Chuck Isler and.
Phil Williams are two.very ﬁne
university men who would -not
stoop to anything petty; we know
that you wouldn’t either.

All High‘ Calibre

Men of such‘ calibre only would

let themselves participate in an

election of only the noblest of ’

politics. Our “Jan. 20" Woody said
that he noticed a dearth of com-
petent persons who‘ are interested
in serving on the Student Gov-
ernment. .

Remember, Woody, this is a

new year, and you're the only
one we know ‘who would fall in,
this category. “He” also said,
f‘I expect to devote my time and
energy to academic affairs and
to extra-curricular ‘activities.
where a more valuable contribu-
.tion to the‘ university and the
community can be made.”

This ﬁrst endeavor -is ﬁne, one
which we hope every university
student takes heed to. But the
second shocks us. You‘ have just

‘Copeland Corrects

Misquoted Statement
-Editor, The Pitt News:

In the Jan. 20 issue of the Pitt
News, I was quoted as having
said, at the ﬁrst “Quotes and
Comments” program, that Chris-
tianity “was not an outgrowth of
social conditions.” ‘ .
What I actually said was that
. it’ was not merely a reflection
of social conditions, but Profes-
sor Cleland disagreed with me,
5asserting that he didn’t see that
, it could be viewed in any other
way.

Many historians and sociolog-
ists treat religions simply as so-
oial movements, and they are
satisﬁed with the adequacy of
such an approach. My contention
is that the assertion (or perhaps
prejudgment) that this is the
;only_ way that religions can be
studied_ involves commitment to
questionable metaphysical doc-
jrines.

 "I have no vested interest in
making the origin of a religion

‘cern, rather, is with the aide-
quacy of the assumption involv-
ed in. the work of the investiga-
.tor.

 Some passages from Sidney
_"Hook’s- book, “The Hero in His-
tory,” indicate the difficulties of
=o "sociological treatment of the
rise of philosophical ideas; per-
haps some of these weaknesses
might also be shared by the so-
4,; ciological interpretation of re-

jian Cleland espouses. _
 The history of philosophy re-

fleets the history of politics, re-,

ligion, and science, but no one
can make it intelligible without
making central in his account
the ideas of Socrates, Plato,
Aristotle, Plotinus, A q u i n a s,
Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz,
Berkeley, Hume,
and Hegel, to stop with theearly
nineteenth century. Sociological
interpretations of philosophy
have been unduly neglected, but
what they explain is why certain
ideas have been accepted with-
in a particular_ milieu, not why
they have been. generated
Even when a philosophy lends
itself to acceptance, no one has
been able togshop that its par-

Every Sunday at 5:30, television viewers across

’ the nation sit opposite their television sets in order

to watch the college world’s answer to the “$64,000
Question.” A whistle is blown, cheers are heard,
and a recording of Sousa’s music
is played. With this accompani-

“College
Quiz Bowl,” appears on the
screen. I '
On this college quiz program
there are eight varsity “ scholars
from two different schools whose
duty it is to answer questions
which are worth an arbitrary‘
number of points. Before the
game begins the competitors in--
troduce themselves. One expects to see them ap-
pear with helmets and football padding in order_
to. ﬁt in with the hest of the program. However,
their coaches who are introduced at half-time ob-
viously don’t think that this precaution is necessary.
The questions are quite interesting ‘and their
difficulty has made many a varsity scholar throw
up their hands ‘in despair. One team was asked to
identify the‘last name of the German philosopher
which‘ ‘rhymed with a kind of roll. Give __up? It
was Hegel and begel. Logically the ne_xt question
should have been-a riddle involving Kant and aunt.
The contestants are also asked to sing, songs, com-
plete nursery rhymes, and name orchestra leaders.
One of the identification questions on ‘the ‘most
recent program concerned ‘the contestant’s ability
to identify a picture of William Smith, of the
Smith Brothers’ Cough Drops. _ '
The program is closed by Allen Ludden's an-

nouncement of the $500 scholarship grant to the
losing school, and the $1500 grant to the winning

 

school. The whistle, the" music plays, the crowd

cheers, and the game is over for ‘another week.
There are evidently some serious things wrong
with this program. "It is conducted in an undigni—-
ﬁed manner and displays about as much academic
atmosphere as a football ﬁeld. Every time tele-
vision sponsors decide that they are going to glorify
the mind, the results ’which they produce seem

Circle Time ...

A Slab a’r Pol itics 

" A e , By Deborah Willson , .

“Chocolate chiffon, chocolate chiffon," the
Pastry ‘Expert muttered, ,"It looks like angelfood
to -me.”‘ He interrupted a -most enlightening dis-
cussion of the Political Situation ,with which our
Circle was engaged. After All, there’s an ELEC-
TION soon. ' 

Our vantage point directly ‘across from the
Salads in the Tuck Shop line was
all to distracting for the effective
control of conversation. “Well if
you're THAT hungry,” I said,
“go get something to eat and
then we’ll Decide. Butbring me
a cup of coffee.” 0

Everyone "re-assembled with
and sundry cups’ of
something and Chocolate Things
on Plates, we began again.

“Who will we vote for in the
Election?” worried the Poet con-' .
scieneiously. (Poets Always vote in student elec-
tions, doing the Useful Thing.) “Eespecially now
that boy -— what’s his name? Something to do with

.9. v

    

trees —-— says he won’t run for president. I like
him, he’s a Socialist.” (Poets are extraordinarily
accurate.) 0

“Maybe that big,-big debater’l1 run!” said the
Athlete excitedly, “What’s his name, Ribbon? I
like him, he looks so fatherly.”

“Fatherly!” screamed the Photographer. “Father-
lyl What WE need is someone who’1l PHOTO-
GRAPH well. Somebody like that girl who Plans
Things —-— Abananani.” (Everybody spells well,
too.)' -

Something to Stand 0

“That’s the trouble with you people,” I. pointed
out, disgusted. You’re college students, and here
you are acting like the "Public. Vote for somebody

.who’ll Do Something, not for somebody who Looks

Good. Why don’t we get a Platform together and
then ﬁnd somebody to stand on it? We need Real
Issues.” ' ‘W ‘ '

to be as farcical as this, as longas they have quiz
shows in mind. ,
Memory Not Learning

Certainly if one wished to have proof that var-
sity scholars exist, one would not listen to the
“College Quiz Bowl.” Thishas nothing to do with
the caliber of the contestants who are undoubtedly
good students. It merely refers to the fact that
few quiz shows give their contestants enough time
to manifest any scholarliness. Scholarly ability is
not displayed’ when one knows at what time of
which daycthe sixth wife of Henry the Eighth cut
her first tooth. One word answers and discon-
nected facts have nothing,-to do with scholarship.

It would be a better idea if varsity scholars.

would sit in a calm, restful atmosphere and dis-
cuss signiﬁcant questions. Rather than pairing
Hegel with begel, they could discuss Hegel by him-
self. They could also dispense -with points, money,
music, and cheering. .

‘A One might argue that through the devious

means of quiz programs the public gains respect A

for knowledge. However, the public.is not gaining

vany respect for knowledge as an end, but for

knowledge as’ a means to money, prestige and con-
solation. prizes. ‘
Test Lacks Validity
General Electric itself seems to feel somewhat
guilty about sponsoring the quiz bowl. After each
contest Ludden announces that General Electric
realizes that a quick recall of facts is not ‘always
the true test of knowledge. If this is so, then Gen-
eral Electric should sponsor another kind of -col-
lege show which is a true test of knowledge.
M Varsity scholars could be brought together in
order to discuss a question with which they are all

A familiar and about which they have done research.
Perhaps this kind of show isn’t sponsored because _
General Electric is afraid that no one would watch_

it, and it must continue to sell its clock radios. ‘If
this is _true the fault. lies with the American public

I thought this was an excellent suggestion, until
the Photographer pointed out with a rare burst
of cognency that what it didn’t’ eliminate was the
Elevator Problem.

“Why I, myself have spent three hours on the

Aim of Director
,“To make the Student
Union less like a Victorian
Hotel and more like a -col-
lege Student Union,” -is the
aim of the new Student
Union Program, according ‘to

Mrs. Huldah McKnight, Evening
Program Consultant.
_,,, Mrs. McKnight has held this
new position since‘ the beginning
of the trimester. She has already

. instituted a new tradition, play-
ing records every night. The stu- .

dents can also bring their own
records and dance.
She also holds bridge lessons
every Thursday evening from 6:30
to 8:00 p.m. These students are
'mostly beginners, and classes are
_ coeducational.

The marble Lounge of the Union
will be a scene of more color
within the next ﬁve Weeks when

 “xTe"w furniture arrives. This new

 

Ii

 
 

.. addit"in will liven the scene with

more colorful, modern furniture,
and a completely new lighting
system, she explained._

.Mrs. McKnight has found that
she has also drifted into the un-
planned role of Social Consultant.
Mrs. McKnight was chosen for the
position because the girls on
campus seemed to avoid the
lounge,- and ‘looked at it as part
_9f the men’s dormitory.

' She had previously worked in
the lobby of Brackenridge House
and knows many of the girls.
Since her new job, ﬁve weeks old,
many more girls have been mak-
.ing use of the facilities in the
Union. - _

The union is open from 9 a.m.

1 a.m. on week-ends.

Mills Leads

‘By JACK SMITH
, It was a‘ cold day last Saturday at University Park,
the Lions, on.» an atempted freeze, froze out the Panthers,

Scorers

and

75-64, and handed them their seventhstraight road loss.
' Why can’t the Panthers ‘win away from ‘the dust ﬁlled
Field House? “It takes a good team to win away from

home,” remarked Coach Bob

Timmons. “I guess We just

aren’t that good.” The Cats ﬁ1st¢

string seems to be able to hold
their own, but there is an obvi-
ous lack in Timmons’ bench
strength.

Poor ball-handling against a
tight Penn State zone, gave the
Lions a commendable 40-24 half-
time advantage. The Panthers
were forced into a press which
resulted, when the Lions tried to
freeze the ball, in fouls."

Panthers Press '

The Panthers roared back to
outscore the opposition by ﬁve ii‘.
the second half, but by that time
the damage already had been
done.-

The Hoopsters were forced
intd it press early in the game
. when the Lions held a 14-point
lead. The press enabled men
like Gene Harris, who was a
thorn in the side of .Timmons
all night, to get inside for the
close shot. ,

Mark DuMars, who had been

0 sidelined with an injury through-

out most of the week, played for

. about 30 minutes and scored 16

points. Many of his points came
from free throws in the last few
minutes of action when the Pan-

thers pressed.

/

‘.  titlein 1953- with Darling and

._ Mills Leads Scorers ,
Although the Panthers, percent-
age wise, were better from the
ﬁeld, the Lions managed more
shots and more baskets. From the
free throw line the Cats were one
better. « ‘
About the only light in the
Panthers night was big John

' .Mills. Mills was the leading

scorer in the game with 22
points. He also grabbed 16 re-
' bounds. But outside of Mills the
Panthers had very little to talk

. about. -

John Fridley, although he pulled
in 17 rebounds, only scored eight

BOB SANKEY
A touch of the ‘Flu

points from the ﬁeld. Fridley hit
on 3 of 13 shots, a performance
below his recent outputs. Dick
Falenski, with 13 points, was the
only other Panthers in double ﬁg-
ures. _

“I thought Mills played a good
game,” Timmons said. -“But many
of our, other players left much to

H irst Breaks Darling’ 3 Record
On Rings as Gymnast Drop Ist

By LARRY HAGGERTY _
They said it couldn’t be done. They said that no Panther

gymnast would ever surpass

All-American Tom Darling’s

282 points on the ﬂying rings during his gymnastics career

at Skyscraper U., but Co-captain Dave Hirst has done it.
The popular senior from Lincoln High School in Phila-

delphia performed theimpossible when "he registered‘ 288

points against Navy last Saturday:
at Annapolis as the Middies dealt
Warren Neiger’s gymnasts a 54-42
defeat and knocked the Jungle Cats
from the ranks of the undefeated.
Besides setting a new record on
the” rings, Hirst wound up the
afternoon by scoring 17 points as
the result of a ﬁrst place ﬁnish on
the high bar and a second in
tumbling.
Hirst Sets’ Record
Both Hirst and Darling attend-
.ed Lincoln High in the “City of
Brotherly Love” and both gym-
nasts decided to further their
careers by attending Pitt.

As a sophomore in 1957, Hirst
established a new Blue and Gold
single-season scoring record by
totaling 111 points and ﬁnished
second to Darling in both the
EIGL and NCAA ring ﬁnals.
Hirst, however, was a much
more valuable team member
since he competed in ﬁve differ-
ent events while Darling spe-
cialized in only two.

Coach Neiger was looking for-
ward to winning the Eastern team

well-balanced squad that also in-
cluded such outstanding gymnasts
as Jim Mulvihill, Jack Hammond,
_Don Shima and Don Neeld.
_ McConnell, Kasner Help
But as luck would have it, Hirst
severely tore the tricepts in his
left arm during a preseason prac-
tice and as a result was forced
to miss the entire 1958 season.
Following an operation, Hirst
came back to lead the_ Panthers
once again last_ year with 73
points. I
Hirst’s only support in the
ﬁrst loss of the 1960 season to
Navy came from Sophomore
Earl McConnell and Co-captain
Don Kasner. McConnell, a grad-
uate of Pittsburgh’s Connelley
Vocational High School, tallied
275 points in winning the
tumbling contest. A
The best that Kasner could do
was a second on the parallelbars
and a third on side horse. Panther
Howard Coley was able to ﬁnish
third to -the Middies’ Nelson
Hulme on the rope climb. Hulme
recorded a very fast time of 3.5‘

falling 21-6. There were no -pins
in the meet but plenty of action.

' The Panthers put the meet
away in the ﬁrst ﬁve matches
when they made a sweep of. the

‘ 123, 130, 137, 147 and 157 pound

classes. After this the Middies had
no chance of capturing the meet.
Dick Surprises

The biggest surprise of the day
came in the 123 pound class where
the Panthers are usually assured
of a victory. But such was not the
case against Navy. Dick Martin,
ordinarily the Panther 123 pound-
er, had to sit this one out be-

had developed on his knee dur-
ing the week.

Taking his place was little
Harry; Dick. Dick had wrestled
once last year when Bob Bubb,
147 pounder, hurt his knee be-
fore the Easterns. Dick who
weighed only 125 pounds at ‘the
time wrestled at 147. Well, he
got beat, but put up a good
battle. .

Saturday against the Middies,
Harry was wrestling in his own
weight class and beat Bob Eller,
,3-1. This match got the Panthers
rolling, and then Larry Lauchle
downed’Jim Lily, 10-3. Lly was
supposedly Navy’s_ toughest man.

Zolikoff Gains Shutout

Sophomore Daryl Kelvington,
remained undefeated for the Cats
by winning a decision over Ron
Boyd. The score was 7-4. Next,
in the 147 pound class, the Mad
Russian, John Zolikoif, shutout
Navy’s Jack Smith, 11-0. Zolikoﬁ
had Smith on his back for more
than two minutes of the‘ ﬁrst per-
iod but the Midshipman refused
to be pinned.

Another surprise for the
Panthers has been the wrestling _
of Augie Arrigoni. The young
sophomore won his second
match by beating John Mc-
Grath,7-6, in a close battle.

Now it was Navy’s turn to get
in .a few licks. Gunner Nelson,
Navy 167 pounder, battled Joe
Schmitt to._a 7-4 win. Schmitt was
ahead going into the ﬁnal period
but was unable -to hold the lead.

In the next two weight classes
the Panthers gained victories be-

Tony Vuocolo won his third
straight match by downing Bill
Brook, 4-l. Vuocolo won hismatch
in the closing, seconds of the ﬁnal
period when he got an escape and
a takedown.

Tom Hall remained undefeat-
-ed when he came from behind
to drop Andy Griffith, 8-6. Hall
was behind 4-1 before he put on
an extra spurt to gain. the vic-
tory. ‘ '

In the heavyweight class Bob’

year when John Christ won —a

For the past two years the Pitt—West Virginia game has
been booked as a contest between Don Hennon and West.
The Panthers no longer enjoy the services of Hennon and
‘have not come up with anyone who will be able to give .West

a run for scoring honors.

Wednesday night West will probably be the leading
scorer and rebounder and will undoubtedly be the best ball
player on the floor. Where does this leave‘ the Panthers?

‘ . '*«'It leaves them in the middle of the'biggest upset of the year.

Take away West and the Mountaineers are no better
than the Panthers. Lee Patrone and Ji.m Warren are West
Virginia’s second and third best men." They are not‘ stand-
out basketball players and may ﬁnd the dusty Field House

floor just a little too much to

handle.

The Cats on the otherhand have four" men who have
been averaging in the double ﬁgures.‘ Their‘ 6-8 record is
not a true’ sign of their ability. At home. the Panthers have

_ ,,l_ost only one game and have looked re_al good on occasion.

‘V“Vednes_,'day they will be out to ‘beat the number three team
in the‘ nation and Tm -sure Timmons will remind‘ the
hoopsters of what the Mountaineers did to our football team.

The circumstances are similar. When West‘ Virginia

' beat the Panthers on the gridiron, their [season was a suc-

cessful‘ one. When Pitt upsets the Mountaineers Wednesday

On Wednesdayiat the Field
House local basketball fans
will get an opportunity to see
West Virginia University’s
Jerry West and Company’s
freshmen counterpart, _Rod
Thorn‘ and Company. . For those
who _may not know,- Thorn and
Co. are the greatest , freshmen
hoop squad in the country.

To date they have posted nine
victories as against no defeats,
and in so doing have averaged
over‘ 100 points per game. Their
highest point production was in
their 124-37 ‘rout of Davis ‘and
Elkin.

Their opposition on Wednes-
day. evening will be the Panther
freshmen coached by Ca 1']
Peterson. Going into this con-
test Peterson’s squad has posted
a ﬁve’ and three won-loss record.
However, ' in. their’ losses to
Youngstown, Bethany and West-
minster, they had to face teams
composed n‘ 4, only of freshmen,
but players not competing on
the school’s varsity. -

In their latest outing, the fresh
hoopsters suffered an 85-75 set-
back at the hands of the West-

minster junior varsity. The Cubs ‘

were lead in the scoring by Ben
Jinks and John Maczuzak who
tallied 25 and 13 points respec-
tively. ' v
, One bright spot in the Titan
contest was thestrong showing
made by reserve center Billy Law.
The former Donora HS star made
a bigimpression with his hustling
and rebounding work. Law joined
the squad at the beginning of the
semester and should continue to
improve as he becomes familiar
with Coach Peterson’s system.

she invented the egg. In 1590, alas, she was arrested for poach-
ing and imprisoned for thirty years in a butt of malmsey. This
later became known as Guy Fawkes Day).

But I digress. Let us get back to spring fashions.

Certain to be popular again this year is the cardigan (which,
curiously enough, was named after Lord Cardigan, who com-
manded the English ﬂeetagainst the Spanish,Armada. The
sweater is only one product of this fertile Briton’s imagination.
He also invented the ball-peen hammer, the gerund, and the
molar, without which chewing, as we know it today, would not
be possible). 4 g _

But I digress..The cardigan, I say, will be back, which is
cause for rejoicing. Why? Because the cardigan has nice big
pockets in which to carry your Marlboro Cigarettes—and that,
good buddies, is ample reason for celebration. Do you think

Army Reserve
Provides Plan

For Non-Vets ’

A reminder of the Army Re-
serve program has been issued by“
Dr. John Geise, assistant chancel-
lor of student affairs.

The Army Reserve program

provides that men through the
ages of 181/; to/25 may enlist in
the Army Reserves for six years
duty. .
Under present laws, unless he is
speciﬁcally exempted, a man, im-
mediately upon graduation, he-
comes eligible for induction into
the ‘Armed Forces for two years
of active duty followed by the
mandatory 4 years reserve duty.
' The Army Reserve provides the
following program:

1. Enlist in a local Army Re-
serve Unit, possibly in their own
or a nearby town.

2. Serve six months active duty,
starting within 120 days’ of en-
listment. ‘

3. Complete their military ob-
ligation by serving in their re-
serve unit for 51/2’ years. This
service consists of 48 weekly drills
and a two-week summer encamp-
ment annually. ‘

The Reserve duty does not re-
strict a man from:

1. Changing civilian occupations

>_ or jobs. V

2. Moving to other localities or
going away to school. .

3. Engaging in any normal
civilian activities.

The Reserve duty does entitle
a man to a full day’s pay for
each class and each day of ﬁeld
training. '

For further» information stu-
dents should contact the local
Army Reserve Unit.
