Local Schools
Join Congress 7
Chest Contest

By Go1m'oN CLOWNEY

\ Carnegie Tech and Du-
quesne have accepted the
challenge. Both schools have
agreed to participate in com-
petition with Pitt in Novem-
ber’s’Community Chest drive.

The . acceptances were an-
nounced by Captain ._Tom Hamil-

munity Chest representative.

Replies were received in re-
sponse to a challenge sent to both
schools by Student Congress in
conjunction ‘with the Pitt Chest
Committee. The challenge asserted
that “members of undergraduate
and graduate schools at Pitt will
give a larger average contribution
than students at either Tech or
Duquesne.” v

The letter went on to say, “We
(S. C. representing the student
body) believe moreover, that a
larger percentage of our 'full-time
students will contribute than eith-
er Tech or Duquesne.”

The Pitt Chest Committee, un-
-der the chairmanship of Clarence
Kylander, Col. 56, wil conduct
their student drive during the
week of Nov. 7-12. The percentage
of Pitt students giving to the
Chest, and the average contribu-_,
tion of each student will be com-
puted and sent to each of the
other campuses for comparison
with their schools’ best efforts.
“From, those who nave, to
those who need” will be this
year's campaign slogan. Last
year ..only $1800 was collected:
however, according to Kylander,
this year's goal wil be 100 per
cent participation. The aim is to
collect at least one dollar from
each student, ‘both on the un-
dergraduate and graduate level.

While we are very eager to see the student union under

It seems a worthy proposition for ‘some student organi-

Right to Represent

There has been little said recently about Men’s Council
other than Men’s Conference.» Of course, elections for vice-
president and a choice of an “Ugly Man” might be consid-
ered some accomplishments. But maybe the inactivity is

due to the consistently poor attendance which has been so *

obvious. \ .

However, business progresses——whatever there is. Presi-
dent Diinitri Petro has come up with_ some parliamentary
procedu e which justifies the scantily-attended meetings.
Says the president, business can be conducted as long as
motions passedare not challenged. '

Well, maybe we’re not such hot parliamentarians. And
certainly Petro should receive some credit for trying to
get’ things done despite missing representatives. But when
ten out of thirty people show up, we don’t see how Men’s

‘Council can claim to represent the men students at the

University in any vote. I I

Old Farmer's Almanac

By Irv Rothmon

Whatever literary conﬁdence I had ever gained

. after having taken a few lit courses last semester,

was dashed to the ground when a professor asked

Dishormonious Harmony

What I found was a great harmony of dishar-

the book in the same form it maintained when it
was ﬁrst edited by Robert B. Thomas .in 1793,, have
included the weather reports, quips, agricultural
information, national holidays, and a lunar calen-
dar, which have been standards for 164 years. They
still publish ,a few critical essays on government

writers. This year, however, A-__bom‘b fallouts jibe

Awaited "Atom.ic Pellets . I  

By Irv Popkin ~

On Aug; 6,1945, every news-
paper headline in“ the» country
screamed “Hiroshima A-Bomb-
ed.” But/even now, more than

, ten, years later, there’s something
“atornic” on the front pages al-
most every day. ‘

_ Those headlines, and the stor-
ies which appeared beneath them
have been carefullyread; atomic
energy has been discussed; and,
like the headlines, feelings and
opinions toward atomic energy
have changed.

Paradoxically, the highest as-
pirations for, atomic energy were
held shortly after it had been
used to fulﬁll a destructive mis-
sion. Yet, we were convinced
that the harnessing_ of atomic
energy would only beneﬁt man-

Coach Michelosen summed up
the performance of his gridders

wasn’t too good. We missed too

Today is a lot different than last Monday. Today, classes
will go on quietly as usual. Last Monday, students were dis-
missed to attend the big victory rally. Today, Soldiers and
Sailors Hall will be quiet. Johnny Michelosen will be at his
Field House office soberly trying _to forget Saturday after-
noon and trying to concentrate on next Saturday.

He won’t be at Soldiers and Sailors Hall with a football
jersey draped over his shoulders, smiling and laughing amid
the cheers. I

The players won’t be at the Hall either today. In-
stead, they’ll be glunily attending classes, paying a little
attention to what the instructor is saying.

, Such are the penalties of defeat. This is the price we
pay for missing that tackle last Saturday. This is the reward
we get for missing a block, for calling the wrong play, or
for letting a receiver get behind us, little mistakes that
. at times would have gone unnoticed by all except the coach-

es, but instead brought the roof down and let an easy touch-
down slip by. v *

Just like that small, thin line that separates a‘ good play-
er from a great player, a good team from a great team; it’s
‘the small mistake that turns that no—gainer into a touch-
down.

Maybe only a step in the wrong direction, a little

slow getting back to defend, or a little too eager to get i

the play started. Little mistakes, sure. But ‘giant oaks

grew from small acorns. , . ,

Why this sudden reversal of form from the week be-
fore? Wasn’t this the same team that toyed with unbeaten
Duke two Saturdays ago? It looked like the same team phy-
sically alright. They wore the same uniforms; they were
the same players, but there all resemblance ceases. This
team made mistakes that weren’t made at Duke. This team
missed ‘blocking and tackling assignments completely at cru-
cial times‘ whereas last Saturday, play was almost ﬂawless.

How is this explained? Can it all be attributed to a
“bad day?” Or was it a slight letdown after the Duke win?
How can a complete reversal of form be pulled from one
Saturday to the next? Is a team always supposed to have
a bad day the very week after a-good game? Must there
always be a slight letdown, conscious or not, following a
big game? . .

The answer appears to be a psychlogical letdown.

How else can you explain the poor tackling last Satur-

day as opposed to the rib-crushing tackles made against

Duke?- At Duke the ball was _jarred loose from ballcar-

riers four times. Saturday, playing in a downpour with

' a wet, slippery hall there was not a single time when a
ballcarrier had the ball shaken loose from him.

If anyone has the answer to why a ,team’s blockers
should cut down the opposition with scythe-like eiﬁciency
one Saturday but miss them left and right the next, please
forward the answer to Michelosen and this department.
Michelosen would like to know and so would we.

For Second Straight Deadlock D

By ED KOLTISKA

Coach Steve Pe_tro’s freshmen tied their second straight
game out of three starts by knotting with the Navy Plebes,
13-13, at Annapolis, Maryland, last Saturday.

The young Panthers, a two touchdown underdog in this
game, threw a scare into the Plebes by scoring in the first
period on a drive of 50 yards. “*
Starting at midfield in the first
quarter, quarterback Bill Kaliden
of Homestead, Pa., threw a 20-
yard pass tohalfback John Flara.
Three plays later. Kaliden. on a
bootleg play, carried the ball to

Classes for Hostesses

Give Global Concept

By BARBARA CHERINGTON

“A good hostess realizes that her position is one of the
most important public relations posts in the University,”
said Miss Patricia Ritz, head of the Nationality Rooms and
Heinz Chapel Training Institute; .

The Institute trains approximately 50 Pitt women each
summer to interpret the seventeen rooms and chapel to
visitors. These June students also learn facts of Pitt’s history
and are well versed on current world affairs. .

‘ This past summer 70 sophomore women participated in
the day and evening classes, which featured faculty speak-
ers, teas, and songs about the Nationality Room. Those who

successfully complete their stud—¢

ies, by passing an oral and writ-
ten test, are (accepted into Quo

_ Vadis sorority.

Ruling Added
This ruling is an innovation over
last year’s plan which accepted

I i .members only after they served as

hostesses for a year.

To lead off each morning’s stud;
ies during the Institute’s ﬁrst of
two weeks, Dr. Edna Batz, direc-
tor of YMCA, usually directs songs

I  of the various nationalities repre-

sented in Pitt’s rooms. '

First among the beginning
“formal” week’s guest speakers
is Dean Rush, who explains the
r e a s 0 ns for a “hostessing.”

‘ , ‘Miss Rush explains how from

general disinterest and slight or-
ganization in guiding visitors
through the- rooms, many years

- . ago, has come this current ef-

ficiently planned institute.
To give the students a world

B I .' point of view Mrs. Ruth C. Mitch-

ell, chairman of the Nationality
Rooms, speaks about’ the back-
ground and culture of the various

’ foreign countries, many of which
’' she has visited. '

Construction. Stressed

H‘. This year Mrs. Mitchell stressed

st, the construction of each room
through, its working committee of

' ‘ ‘the respective nationality. Second-

 ly, she told of the great potential
.. :for..“educational exchange and cul-
;_ 'tural understanding of Pitt’s vis-
’ i itors through their impressions ‘of
'7 the hostesses.

Lastly, Mrs. Mitchell spoke of
the committees’ increasing
«amount of work with the cur-
riculum of the University. This
has been evidenced by the Chi-
nese committee’s work in Far
Eastern studies and the Greek

 ,' committees efforts to encourage
' \ study of that classical language.

Another highlight _of this year’s
Institute was a discussion, led by

A "history professor, Dr. James Liu,

and Dr. Albert Martin, who rep-

v resented the Eastern and Western

cultures respectively.

Next to speak was Dean of the
College, Stanton Crawford, presi-
dent of Pittsburgh’ Foreign Policy
Program. Dr. Crawford explained
core-curriculum and liberal arts

A n ' . value in connection with the rooms.

Art Styles Explained
Demonstrating types of art used
in the rooms, Virginia Lewis, art
department secretary, used slides
to help ,explain recognition of
types such as the Greek Classic,
Italian Renaissance, and French
Imperial styles.
, The students usually get an
opportunity to sit in on the
work of one of the Nationality
Room committees. Members of
this summer's conference met
the personnel who organized to
build’ the Yugoslav room. ‘
Near the end of last J une’s stud-

ies, the women heard Alice Smolk- .

speak about her 1954 trip to

MC Picks UglyMan,

Makes

Retreat Plans ,

By ALB DONALSON V

About the only thing Men’s‘Council unanimously agreed

on at their meeting last Wednesday afternoon was the se-

lection of Chris Christ, Bus. Ad._ ’57, as MC’s representative

in the “Ugly Man” contest; 9

Christ ‘swept the election, poll-
ing all of ten possible votes.

Most of the rest of the after-
noon was spent with MC solons
disagreeing a m o n g themselves
about a. proposed ret_reat.~ After
about 20 minutes of hassling,
President Dimitri Petro appointed
Joe Anania, Bus. Ad. '56, and John
Lomond, Bus. Ad. ’56, to work
along with Ron Sobel, Col. ’57,
chairman of the-MC social commit-'
tee, to formulate a» stag retreat
immediately. Council will abide by
the committee decision.

Nearly all of_the members of
Council have expressed the opin-
ion that a retreat would enable MC
to become better acquainted with
themselves, thus making for a
more cohesive» group which could
expedite Council business more ef-
ﬁciently.

In other business for the after-
noon, Ed Schultz, Col. ’57, chair-
man of the executive committee,
announced a new ruling regarding
absenteeism. The new law‘ states
that if a Councilman misses four

meetings without excuse, he is. lia-

ble to expulsion from

Business Rises 

Bureau States

According \_ to the Bureau of
Business Research of the Univer-
sity, business in the Pittsburgh
district recovered the reported
drop of last week, owing mainly
to an increase in trade. I

There was little change in in-
dustrial production and freight
shipment from the week ending
Oct. 18. However, business in the

I
.

Pittsburgh area has held near ,., 

current levels since about
April.

Steel mills in the Pittsburgh
district raised operations to over

mid

one hundred per cent of practical ~

capacity in the ‘past week, but the
blast furnaces held unchanged.
Bituminous coal was down lat
shade from the preceding week.
However, a new record high was

.. reached in the electrical power

output. —
Department store sales "were

down from the preceding week,

but new motor car registrations

and-bank clearings climbed sharp- _

October 15, gross sales of the

Pittsburgh department s t o r e s
were 20 per cent ahead of ‘the
total in the comparable four weeks
in 1954.

tive articles published for the interest of Pitt Veterans.
The questions were submitted at various times to the Veter-
ans Administration in Washington, D. C.)

VA to deduct enough money out
of my compensation to take care
of my insurance premiums, so I
wouldn’t have to bother with them

Korea GI term insurance within
120 days from my separation. Will

you need do is ﬁle an applica-
tion and pay your ﬁrst prem-
ium—within the 120 days after
your separation.

a GI loan, is the salesman’s com-
mission considered a part of the
