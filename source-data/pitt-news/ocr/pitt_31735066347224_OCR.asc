f‘PoIice Strike Drags on
Univ.-Copsat Stand Off  

in

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

The Campus Police strike
stretches into its fourth day today
and the striking Campus Police and
the University are at a stand -off.

7 Chief Union Steward John Forgie
said yesterday no effort has been
made to bring the striking Campus
Police and the University together
for further negotiations.

Campus Police walked off their
jobs Monday evening following a
38-0 vote to reject the University’s
ﬁnal contract proposal.

According to Forgie, many of the

Matthews Concert Off Again

BY RICH HARRY

The controversial Ian Matthews
concert, scheduled for this Sunday,
has been cancelled following a
Student Government Board (SGB)
decision Wednesday to deny
additional funding for the show. -

Tim Stoops, co-chairman of Pitt
Programming concert committee,

A yesterday conﬁrmed cancelation of

the show, which has been marred by
poor publicity and disagreements
over location.

Despite the cancelation", $2,500
will be forwarded to Ian.Matthews

-to meet contract obligations.

The concert, scheduled for David
Lawrence Hall, was designed as an
alternative show to replace the
cancelled Homecoming concert that
was to headline the New Riders of
the Purple Sage and included Ian
Matthews as the opening act." .

The Board, supporting a recom-

mendation by the Student Govern-_ _ H

inent Allocations Committee, voted
4-2 to deny an ‘additional $718.90
request to cover additional costs.
The SGB cited the limited time for
Programming to start advertising
the concert as "a reason for the

‘ funding denial.

“There hasn’t been enough
publicity to attract students to the
show to warrant risking an
additional $718.90,” SGB member
Robin Wertkin said.

Programming members yester-
day explained they didn’t advertise
because of ~ uncertainty over the
status of the concert. “Sponsoring
a concert has been up in.the air ever
since The New Riders of the Purple

Programming member said.

SG Allocations System

Review Survey Pushed A

BY PAUL MATHEWS

An increase in the student
activities fee may be required next
year to avoid substantial cutbacks in
the current level of student
programming and services on
campus, according to Allocations
Committee member Dave Hesi-
dence.

Hesidence explained with the
tight money situation there is no
way the current level of student
programming and services can be
continued. Even if the activities fee
in increased, next year’s Alloca-
tions Committee will have to
establish a more efficient‘ and
equitable system of priorities for
funding student committees and
organizations, he said.

This year, student programming

and services suffered sweeping cut
backs, Hesidence said, because the
Allocations Committee received

initial budget requests totaling_

$440,000 when the Allocations

committee only had $285,000'with.

which to work. A _
The Allocations Committee is

A the Student Government Commit-

tee responsible for. allocating the

Hesidence has recommended in a

where and how students feel the
activities funds should be spent.
“A survey of this type would be
beneﬁcial because it would feel out
the general opinion on campus
regarding an increase in the
activities fee. It would provide both
the SGB and future Allocations
Committees with a means to
establish the necessary system of
priorities for equitable funding of
student committees and organiza-

tion, which best serve theneeds and ' '

wants of the student» body."
Hesidence said.

“The data fromthis survey also- ’

could be invaluable in providing they
SGB with a purpose or some general
goals to pursue in the future. At the

learned of the Allocation Commit-
1-itee’s recommendation to deny the
additional funding,” Stoops ex-
8 plained.

Board members also questioned
whether Programming could effec-
tively co-produce a'Nov. 12 concert
with the Black Action Society while
advertising and sponsoring the Ian
Matthews show.

“Technically, we can do both
shows,” Programming Co-Chair-
man Andy Coleman told the Board.
“Promotion—wise, I don’t know.”

 Despite Allocations and SGB

" agreement to hold the Matthews
show in the Lower Lounge of the
Student Union, Programming
scheduled the concert in David
Lawrence Hall to accommodate
more students.

Allocations member Carol .
Thomas pointed out to the Board

that Programming failed to ap-
proach Allocations for reapproval of
the room chzhige, as required under
Allocations Committee guidelines.

Programming 7 Co-Chairman Bill
Lurye explained his comittee did not
approach Allocations for reaproval
because “We were under the
impression a show in David
Lawrence Hall was acceptable to the
Board. V»

The Board discussed, but did not
ofﬁcially approve, a concert in
David Lawrence Hall.

In other business at Wednesday’s
meeting, the Board voted to send
back for consideration a recommen-
dation from the Allocations Com-
mitee to deny the Programming
concert committee a transfer in
funds within its budget used for last
week’s Andy Pratt show.

. suggesting we allocate 80% of the
activities monies for programming
and 20% for operating costs. Thus,
we were forced to deal with
individual items, trying to ‘stay
within the 80-20 parameters, and to
establish guidelines and priorities
as we went along,” he said.

1... The SGB has been toying with the
gﬁflevelopment of a thorough survey

since June, according to SGB

President Barry Weisband.

“The survey was one of my
campaign pledges to the student
body,” Weisband said. .

During a preliminary meeting
last June with SGB member Robin
Wertkin, Assistant Director of
Student Activities Nancy Evans,
Todd Sommons from Urban Res-
earch and Weisband, the survey
was tentatively discussed—Wert-

kin was assigned to develop the,
I survey.

Wertkin said the survey has
stalled because there are ‘several
problems dealing with the Buckley
Amendment, the law which prohib-
its the release of conﬁdential
information without prior consent of
the student.

Wertkin also said the survey will
de-emphasize the allocations issues
and focus on student government
concerns. It will include questions

such as what the student body

perceives SGB’s functions to be,
where the SGB should move in the
future, and why students don’t vote
in SGB elections, Wertkin said.

An interview format probably will ;

be used for the survey, Wertkin
said. It will probably query 200 to
400 students to be selected

Programming sought to transfer
$199 incurred from underspending
on the show’s sound production and
use it to compensate an overexpen-
diture on hospitalities.

Allocations denied the request
because allocating funds to make up
for overexpenditures constitutes
“deficit spending,” which is

contrary to Allocation Committee
guidelines, Thomas reported.

Concert, concert, who's got the concert? Apparently no one will see a
Homecoming concert this year, since the Student Government Board
has okayed the Allocation Committee’s recommendation not to approve
additional funds for Piograrmning Committee to hold the Homecoming

concert in David Lawrence Hall this Sunday. , A '

Without these fimds the show cannot go on.

the whole  has been one bungle after another. Programming
Committ ee members have been trying to demonstrate how well they can

‘arrange a concert without anyone’s help. Allocations has been showing

how well it can follow guidelines. And Student Government is proving

how, even though misinformed, it can still follow parliamentary
procedure, student entertainment be damned. No one has cooperated
with anyone. . ,

the most pitiful performance has been by the Board itself. It oﬁered
no direction when it was needed and remained ominously quiet when its

A opinionwould have set precedent and settled questions. .

the actions of some Board members causes one to -wonder if they
actually knew what was going on with programming the concert. Did
theyknowlanMatthewsneededmorespacethanthe Iowerloungehad
to offer? V. Did they know Prograrmning felt that David Iawrence Hall

v would be ideal for the concert? Did they knowthat students look forward

to. the Homecoming concert more than any other Homecoming event
save the game on Saturday afternoon? _

Did they know Programming had already sunk money into publicizing
the concert? Did they know it was “worth risking an additional
31>/18.90,’ ‘ since lan Matthews gets paid approximately $2,500, whether
he plays in David Lawrence Hall or not at all? _

Since the concert will not be held, about $2,500 of student activities
tee money is being sent to tan Matthews for not playing. Surely this
would warrant another edict from Student Activities against such a gross
waste of the activities fee. But they, too are quiet.‘

Does Student Govermnent really wantthe concert? For all they hadto
do was reject the recommendation and send it back to 
When the recommendation not to hold the concert would be brought
back, “Student Govermnent could reject that again.

According to by-laws, it would then be up to the Board to forge a
budget modiﬁcation. 'Ihe Board could have held a concert any way they
wanted. ' ‘  . ..

.Butinstead,.Student Government let Programming dart up and down

blmd alleys, moving fartherand farther from Allocations 

And when Programming reached the point where the concert could not
be held, instead of SGB redirecting them towards a workable concert,

the simple solution would have been for thethree groups Eseék their
advisors and with their help put together a concert for the students.
Let 5 hope that this will be next year's approach to programming the

Editor’s note: This is the first
installment in a two-part series of
Tom Waseleski’s impressions
gathered at the Terrace Room in
the William Penn Hotel with fellow
Democrats last Tuesday.

There was hell
Tuesday night.

But the Democrats weren’t going
to stab swiftly and surely, not could
they turn the knife slowly. Indeed
it was a long time before we knew

a who had the”handIe and who was

searing his own ﬂesh with the
blade.
- Nevertheless there was hell to be
paid. Paid for the unemployment,
paid for the gasoline and bread
p prices, paid for the Mayaguez, paid
for the pardon, paid for that last
injection in Vietnam, paid for that
near.-involvement in Angola.
There was hell to be paid for
those _carefree football passes
beforelnetwork cameras, for the

placid Republican smiles and the.

confident words that greeted yet
more disheartening economic
news, for the man who wanted to
look presidential instead of act it.
And there was a Terrace Room
full of Carterites _in the William
Penn Hotel who‘ wanted nothing
more than to bring an inferno down
on the heads of a few choice

Republicans, one of whom was 17..

floors ‘above.
At 7:30 they were doing their

best to -repress whatever; passions .  .

had been stirred over the past two

terms, but then there were only.
about 30 of them lounging around, -

slouched comfortably before
several TV sets."
In a couple of hours it would be
i smoke and bologna sandwiches,
Schmidt’s beer and cautious
pandemonium as the electoral vote
edged upward. But as it was, the
large, open Terrace Room echoed
Cronkite *-and Chancellor off the
wall at each other, while the small,
mostly young group looked on.

The Heinz people must have been
conserving something throughout

the campaign. Their 18'-inch gas
balloons were practically bursting
off their,strings.

But here, too, it was a time to
just mill around, watch the country
band set up, and plant yourself in
front of one of the chattering TV
sets. There were twice as many of
them here as down in the Terrace
Room. but then there was three
times as much room in the
ballroom. plus Heinz’s spread in

it the Queen was -too flabbergast-
'ed to comment, her sisters from
Alpha Kappa Alpha had plenty to
say. "We're number one, second to
'none" and "The mean pink and
green is the sorority supreme" were
their slogans of the day.

Debbie Naylor and Mary Stepp-
ling, the Homecoming queen's
chairmen announced the queen and
her court.

Davis’ attendants were as
follows: Donna Herbert, a member
of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.
She was sponsored by the
Engineering Students Cabinet;

it is not the talent or lack of it--it's,

Alpha Delta Pi, Zeta Beta Tau,

oi their company faked drunken-

Scope mouthwash.

Next, Delta Tau Delta and Delta

ended in mass stabbings. its high V
point was when th'e""'corpses" sat
up and declaiined in verse as a new '

O’Brien. The candidate first must
find" a group to sponsor her
candidacy, a task that isn’t always
easy. Then ‘she must ﬁll out an
application. « Each- candidate is
given a set of guidelines she must
follow during her campaign. These
guidelines are concerned with
items such as where the candidate
may post her campaign posters and
flyers. The candidate next must
. write a short essay about what the
Homecoming queen shou-ld do
throughout her reign.

Kippiiis vocals and guitar work

. T BY PETE BUTCH

What makes a restaurant a

restaurant? What‘ makes a
restaurant not a restaurant? The
Taj on Oakland Avenue left me with
mixed emotions.

In the “pro” column, the woman
at the counter brings the food to

one’s table. It is in adequate-sized ’

portions for around two dollars.
And it is honest-to-goodness Indian
cuisine—th'e food is spiced with‘
curry, ginger, cinnamon,’ bay leaf
and other exotic spices. ' .
V On the other hand, one has to go

, up to her and giver her your order,

"like one does in McDonalds. And
-the food comes on paper plates, and

 .‘ .5tYr°f°am-:1' cups . with plastic.

   

' tableware. And forget atmosphere,
: the place looks like a pizza parlor
without pizza.

But one can forgive. the above
because you get a decent meal at a
decent price.

Stay away if you don’t like rice.
That's the staple of most dishes. My
partner tried chicken with curried
rice and Ihad beef with curried rice.
Vegetarian plates also are avail-
able. I got about a dozen cubes of
very spicy stewed beef, a half plate
of rice and some tasty boiled
‘cabbage. The other dish was
similar except it had a chicken wing
with sauce instead of the stewed
beef._

When, there, one must try the
Indian style tea and the desserts
offered. The tea ' is interesting,

some exotic leaf brewed with
ginger, cinnamon and other spices,
diluted with milk and slightly luke
warm. Despite that description, it
does taste good. ‘ *

For dessert we tried Gulab J amin
and Burﬁ. The ﬁrst is a
cheese-cake-like ball soaked in
sugar-syrup. The latter is sort of a
milk fudge without cocoa and with
nuts and dried fruit. Both are very
satisfying for the sweet tooth.

Those with timid stomachs
should stay away. The food is very
spicy and strongly ﬂavored. But
those who long for something other
than the bland pap spooned out by
Key Management in the Towers

basement should. deﬁnitely make  .. A
their way .to the Taj as soon as they . 2

Two dinners and two desserts
with tea and ginger ale came to
$5.75. ‘Which makes-the Taj the
place to go for a different meal at a
different (low) price.

h"s Gold Only C)n The Field

BY BETH_ KROMER

To many people on campus,
being a Golden Girl majorette
means wearing a shimmery bathing
suit, doing highkicks and having a
great love life on the side. _ Though
before a crowd it seems to be all
glitter and ﬂash, all smiles, Larry
Cervi, choreographer for the
majorettes at Pitt and also at Penn
State and Churchill High School,

knows the hard work behind the

scenes.

“The majorettes have to work as
hard as anybody else on the football
ﬁeld. They have to be a top notch
group because they are with a top
notch football team.” - ‘

To audition, each Golden Girl
must know advanced baton techni-

ques and have some training in jazz

and _ballet. These skills combine in
the "routine called “dance twirl,”
which is a combination of dance
steps and baton exercises. '
accepted, the potential majorette’s
weight must be proportionate to her
height \and her hair must be

shoulder len-gth. Then, to stay a-

Golden Girl, they must weigh in
weekly, as well as try out weekly to
perform in the Saturday shows.
“The giirlshave to have. a lot of.
stamina and must bewell-coordin-_

ated and mentally quick to learn .a -
new routine- each week,” ’ Cervi E

says.
pMost of the women were

. majorettes in high school, so the

pace isn’t new to them, but they
found it a lot tougher here at Pitt;
“There are more people looking at
you and watching you and more
criticism here, ’ ’ saidpone majorette.

One women objected to having
her hair cut at iﬁrst but she now

To be ~

' admits “it does get in your way on

the ﬁeld and it looks nice when

, everyone is the same.”

Cervi feels the regulations are
important _because the outﬁt is
looking for a uniform appearance.
“This is not solo work,” Cervi
stresses. “We are looking for a
uniform style and precision in our
shows.”

 

  
  

— - The Golden Girls steppd out with the band. Not many people will be

The majorettes feel they are a

part of the band and enjoy the thrill
of performing on the ﬁeld. Some of
the majorettes have had some
sarcastic comments on “the reputa-
tion” of a Golden Girl but most feel

that the remarks were all in fun.

“I feel proud to be/ a majorette
and’ a member of the band
organization, ” said Golden Girl Sue
D’mico.'he oranization we get

 

aware of all the work that goes behind the glitter of their performance

Saturday at the Homecoming game.

"The majorettes have been
‘ criticized for not doing enough"

baton twirling in their routines. -But
Cervi thinks the audience identiﬁes
with bodies moving to._music.' “We
try to have, a good balance of
twirling and dance movements,” he '
says. And as to the criticismrthat
the Golden Girls are unnecessary
for -the /band show, Cervifeels the
women add “the essential icing to
the cakeand are an integral part of

the halftime show. ’ ’

A’ No Girnmicks, Just
  Pu re--POwerFunk

BY GEORGE FAINES

Monday night’s Towerof Power
and Ronnie Laws concert at the
Stanley Theatre showcased two of

the most underrated’ acts in the .

nation. The top billing Tower of
Power proved to be extremely tight

and featured one ofthe best ’horn p

sections around.
What makes’ Tower of‘ Power so

distinct from all of’ the — other

funk-rock bands is’ its simplicity.

« The band members avoid getting

carried away and stick to the basics.

. Therewere no gimmicks, surprises,

or special effects...just-an hour of

‘the Tower’s forceful funk.

They’ve been blowin’ and‘,
growin’ since the early days of
Haight-Ashbury and are one of the
last of the original California bands.
Their music . is _“solid street,”
complete with fluid horns and heavy _

i on the rhythm. , i ,

On .“What «Is Hop,” Tower lead
singer Hubert Tubbs took oontrol_
and got the crowd moving. All ﬁve

still to this tune, then. there ' is

deﬁnitely something wrong ‘with

of rhythm n’ blues.

Most opening acts are nothing
more than =ﬁll-ins for the featured
attraction. This was not the case
with Ronnie Laws and his band,
Pressure. ‘

Laws is one of the hottest
saxophonists in the land and his.

‘performance was sizzling, to say the

least. The majority of -his material

was from his’Fever album, which a

has been one of the best received

"jazz-funkrecords -of the year.

The music ranged from the very
rhythmic “Let’s Keep It Together”
to the beautiful and inspiring ‘ ‘Stay

Still (And Let Me Love You).” The ’

latter piece really gave Laws an
opportunity to display his talent, as
he kept alternating between tenor
and soprano sax.

_ What’ was jmissing in Laws’
material was diversity. Everything
sounded similarand at times even

Everything else here is so

unorganized that it is good to be in a
group and have some discipline; We
enjoy what we are doing and what
contribution ’ we make to the
halftime show. I don’t know what I
would do if I wasn't in majorettes—
it sure keeps me in shape!” .

Turns 0”’Th"=‘J°ZZ   

BY VINCE ROBERTSON

Get Acquainted is a. black
corporation of four- bar owners that
sponsor an event called Celebrity
Night of Stars. Each Monday night,
one of their four bars features a live
group that can range from local to
national talent. . The bars and
owners involved are Bill Davis’
Black Magic, 4653 Centre Avenue
(Davis, incidentally, initiated the

ﬁrst disco nightspot in Pittsburgh .

four years ago, featuring Billy
Soul); Jerry Better’s Crescendo
Loungeon Melwood Street; Jim
Hunter’s Eileen’s Bar and Grill on
Dallas Avenue; and Brenda's D.J.s
Lounge on Baum Boulevard.

The organization is one year old
and apparently successful enough
to plan expansion into bigger
events, i.e., cabarets and concerts
featuring top-notch entertainment.
If you are familiar with any of these

bars, you will notice that each
lounge‘ displays an overall adver-
tisement of the location of each
Monday night’s session. _

You would expect to encounter
the sophisticated of the professional
/working class crowd, and you do.
Still, they maintain a pleasant
atmosphere tdparty in. The people

. you see in the crowd or end up

rapping to range from local and
national celebrities and heroes such
as Doc Ellis ,- whenever he’s in town;
Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh
Pirates;' Frenchy Fuqua, Joe
Greene, dwight White, Ernie
Holmes, etc. of the Pittsburgh
Steeler’s;’ to visiting V.I.P.’s such
as Joe Williams, jazz singer; James
Moody, jazz singer/instrument-
alist; Barbara Jordan, congress-
woman; to yourself.

The lounge, Black Magic, — is .

‘hazy’ and ‘cozy’ (both upstairs" and
downstairs). D.J. ’s is expansive
and active (again, both up and
downstairs). All of thelounges have
dancing space—+I can’t say ample

dancing space, because there is no .

Silverberg closed the anthology
with Vonda McIntyre’s “Screw-
top.” “Screwtop” is about
survival on a bleak prison planet.
focusing on the troubles on Kylis, a
hardened prison woman; Gryf, a
carefully bred man who rebelled
against his creators; and Jason, a
writer put in prison by accident.

While “Screwtop” is a compe-
tent novella, it did not reach the
high standard set by the other two.
It would work better as a short
story instead of a novella. The plot
drags along, bogged down in the

mire just as McIntyre’s characters-

are stuck in the mud of the prison.
The characters were too stero-
typed: the tough girl, honest
prisoners sent to jail for no reason
and the evil head guard with a vast
array of torturous punishments.

Zappa: Loony, Gifted

What is the imageconjured up in
your mind when you hear the name
l-rank Zappa? Biting political
satire‘.’ Brilliant musicianship? Out
and out lunacy? No matter what
your personal vision is of the man,
Zappa has probably lived up to it in
his long, wacky career.

Emerging’ in the mid-60s, Zappa
was probably the definition of an
underground artist. His records
never received AM airplay or

.  straight press acclaim. He survived
 by appealing to a young,
' generation that’ was willing to

, explore his weird visions.

\

Burnt Weenie Sandwich, We’re

Rip My Flesh, and Rueben and the

give you an idea of where the man is
coming from. Zappa and his ever
changing group, the‘ Mothers of
invention, have occupied a large,
humorous chunk in the world of
American satire, incorporating it
in_to tasty rock, jazz and blues.

in 1974, Zappa released his most
popular album to date, Apostrophe,
an album that took him outiof cult
status, into the ranks of rock
stardom. No longer was Zappa's
lunacy limited to selective college
‘and intellectual audiences; the
masses started picking up on him.

W cirdness aside, Zappa has proved '

That's the current situation with
7-Fthe Pitt football team, which has
in breezed through its ﬁrst eight ball

lack of success and 3 2-9 record last
season in the Wishbone. Army
coach Homer Smith has therefore
unleashed a strong passing attack
which, this week, will be ﬁring into
one of the nation’s top defensive
secondaries. Pitt comerback Bob
Jury is seventh in the nation with six
interceptions, while monster back
Jeff Delaney has ﬁve.

The Cadets’ passing also may be
hindered due to the absence of tight
end Clennis Brundidge, who ranks
ﬁfth in receiving with an average of
5.4 completions per game, due to
the death of his brother in an auto
accident.

In the Army backﬁeld with Hall
will be Anthony Pyne, the Cadets’
leading rusher for the past two
seasons. Pyne averages 4.4 yards
per carry and has caught 23 passes

providing another reason for the
Cadets’ reliance on an aerial
offense.

“We’re improved,” Smith em-
phasized. “Younger than we were a
year ago, but a notch faster, a notch
stronger and certainly more exper-
ienced at quarterback.”

With only 10 seniors on their
entire traveling squad, the Cadets’
immediate future appears to be
bright if any number of their young
players blossom into talented
performers as seniors.

“I'm very much impressed with
their recruiting," Majors said.
“They (Army) have a lot of young
people and they’re one of the
youngest teams we’ve played. But
they’re stronger up front defen-

C sively and they have much more

than any Army team we’ve played:
since coming to Pitt.”

Majors is speaking of defensive
tackles Karl D’Amico (6-4, 235) and
Raymond Beverly (6-0, 235). The
Cadets also have two massive
offensive tacles averaging 242
pounds and two guards averaging
225——though not as gigantic as Pitt
tackles Joe Stone (6-4, 263), George
Messich (6-4, 242) and John
Hanhauser (6-2, 252) or guards Tom
Brzoza (6-3, 234) and Matt Carroll
(6-3, 265). _

But it’s the Army spunk that
impresses Majors the most. “Foot-
ball is a very tough game,” he said,
“and these military people" are

trained with discipline, toughness, ‘

physically and mentally, and they
have a very stringent training
schedule. They will play up to their
potential week after week.”

But playing up to their potential -

may not even be enough to stop the

all in all, the offensive threat that
Corbett now poses has helped to
open up those essential outside
rushing lanes for Dorsett.

“\We’re throwing the ball

most of the passing his way..
-‘‘‘we’re mixing it up more. That's

Booters set In Light Fire 
  Under Visiting Mountaineers

BY JIM LEWIS

Ah, Homecoming! The time for
colorful parades, crisp autumn
leaves, crackling bonfires and
soccer. '

Soccer? A _

lhat's right; the Pitt soccer team
(4-6-1) will host rival West Virginia
tonight at 7 in Pitt Stadium.

Why ‘hold a soccer match on’,

Homecoming eve? Two reasons:
(1) lo hopefully whet everyone’s
appetite for a football victory by
starting a winning trend and (2)‘
Because last year, the Mountaine-
ers treated Pitt to a “Mountaineer
Week," pre-football game extrava-
ganza, which West Virginia won,
1-0. It would only be ﬁtting to
return the favor, which isn't outof

' the realm of possibility. _ .
"if we can play a ball game like

last l-"riday's (a 1-0 loss to Lock
Haven), then 1 think we'll be in the
game," coach Leo Bemis claimed.
lrue, if the Panthers can keep up
the same quick, aggressive style
they unveiled against Lock Haven,
then a victory could be very much
lor real. ‘
A win over West Virginia
wouldn't look bad. either. The
Mountaineers don‘t exactly boast
the best squad in the world (3-b-1

trosuburg). but they have gone up

 crop. .

shown we‘ can do that when we put
our minds to it. As far as injuries

haven't been able to win the big

And indeed this is a big one, if
both teams hope to reach the .500
mark. But it won't be easy. Pitt and
West Virginiahave met 16 times in

(the past, with the Mountaineers

super-close, low-scoring contests.
What will make the task even

5 tougher for the Panthers is a guy by

the name of Roberto Calcadilla, a

tricky Mountaineer forward.
"Lalcadilla isthe catalyst of their

attack’, ' ’ Bemis stated. ‘ ‘He likes to

' trick‘ you. ' " A .

indeed he is a catalyst, as West
Virginia Wesleyan proved earlier)
this year. Wesleyan downed the
Mountaineers, 1-0, by using a
simple gamcplan—-deny Calcadilla

Savage And Susang Two Of A ‘Kind   .

BY JOHN FINN

Both of them are freshmen, major
in pre-med, about the same size,
played volleyball at Norwin High
School and led their team to the
1976 state volleyball championship.
And now, both of them are starting
for this year's Pantherette volley-
ball squad.

Mary Savage and Mary Lou
Susang began playing volleyball in
high school where their talented
coach, Sharon Watson, tutored
them to excellence. .

Watson is known in volleyball
circles as a fine player and a very
successful coach. The two young

setters also played under Watson
during the off-season on a United
States Volleyball Association team
that she organized, and they give
her a great deal of credit for their

; accomplishments.

The two dedicated volleyball
players majoring in pre-med are
kept pretty busy. “There is time for
other things,” Mary said, “but not
much. We both spend a lot of time
studying and the rest of the time it
seems like we’re playing volley-
ball.” - -. . . . .

Despite their size (both are about
5’4”), Susang and Savage are
probably the most valuable players

coach Mike Hebert. The women

rotate with each other. Each plays
three positions across the back line,
but their responsibility is to come up

p and set the ball for one of the three

tall players up front.

“Our setters serve as quarter-
backs for our offense, ' ' Hebert said.
“They call the plays and set the ball
for our hitters. If our setters fail,
our entire offense fails and we
lose.”

So far, however, the two young
setters have overcome the pressure
and have led Pitt to an excellent
top notch -
competition. '

How does it feel to start for a
varsity volleyball team at a major
college as a freshman?

Well Savage and Susang had
hoped to play, but they were
surprised to be starting. “We both
worked real hard and hoped for the
best,'.’ Savage said.‘

All that hard work paid off as the
two young setters share a major
responsibility on a team that has a
reasonable chance to go to
Nationals.

For some women, it may be a
difficult transition from a female
coach to a male coach, but there are
two male volleyball coaches at Pitt.
Nevertheless, neither Susang or
Savage nor the rest of the team has
experienced any problems.

.What could these two women,
who have so much in common, do
for an encore? Why they room
together, of course.

But as far as Pitt is concerned, the
