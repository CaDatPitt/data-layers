s Folk, Singers Play at Loss;
 Loan Fund Concert Draws
 449‘ At $1800 Deficit

Last:‘Wednesday’s beneﬁt concert by the Serendipity
Singers vstas a “sad, sad;t- story” according to Parker En-
wright, associate dean of men. Total attendance was 449,
“some of ‘hom were not students. In other words, not even
449 students-bought tickets,” said Enwright.

The c ncert, which was to aid the Men's Dormitory
,_ Council, MVn’s Council, and Interfraternity Council loan
;..»*- funds, lost s ,3o0. “This,” stated '

" wright, “was despite the fact
hat the prices of the tickets were
the lowest ever sold to} the
- Serendipity ingers and also that

they had a eed. to appear at

one-half the price they usually
charge.’f ' /

Ehwright cited two reasons for
the failure of the concert. The
first involved “the failure of the
individual students to support it,
and the second concerned the
failure of student organizations
to purchase block seats,’which

fgwwas ‘the basis, of the initial plan-

A?

ning. ~ .

“The Pitt student body,” con-
cluded Enwright, “does not usual-
ly have the purchasing power to
cover big name entertainment.
It is very disappointing that they
did not support it when they got
it at a reduced price.” I /

Trimester Major Factor in Costs;
Contract Plan Suggested Solution  

By MARSHA REHNS

Despite praise for ten years of
development, the University re-
ceived strong criticism for unnec-
essary expenditures ,and a sug-
gestion for a state affiliation sim-
ilar to that of Penn State in a
report issued by a Ford Founda-
tion Study committee yesterday
at the Hilton Hotel.

The report, divided-into an as-
sessment of the University’s ﬁ-
nancial and academic policies and
a plan for recovery, saw the “dis-
mal failure of the trimester to
appeal to undergraduates” as "the
“major contributor” to the Uni-
versity’s ﬁnancial difficulties and
increase in cost of educating the
individual student.

Although the committeapraised

the University for undertaking

the trimester experiment, it noted
that the program doubled educa-
tional costs per student but did

not sufficiently increase summer,

enrollment to covert-the‘ deﬁcit. It
advised answering all questions
about the trimester" system before
another year‘ of operation. ‘ j

Payment of 70 per cent of‘the
faculty on a 12 month rather than
school year basis, possible inade-
quate reimbursement for con-
tracted research, and a large in-
crease in the graduate, but not

the less costly undergraduate

programs, were lesser factors.
Raising tuition for residence
hall development may have
caused a decrease in enrollment,
the report continued. It also sug-
gested that “fewer top execu-
tives” would cut down adminis-
trative costs with the impetus for
growth formerly generated by
Ex-Chancellor Litchﬁeld coming
from the faculty.
’The"state plan proposed by the
committee is similar to the Cor-
nell plan in which New York sub-
si 1235 Cornell for educating state
residents. Although the Cornell

LA Assembly Approves Changes
In Distribution, Probation Policies

By VICKI EPSTEIN
New distribution of studies re-
quirements were approved by the
Academic Assembly last week

§J"§_;and willbecome effective for all
“ students-in the fall trimester,

 

according to Dr. James A. Kehl,
dean of the School of Liberal
Arts and chairman of the Exe-
cutive Council which devised the
new program. ’

The Academic Assembly; which
consists of all faculty members
who regularly offer courses in
the School of Liberal Arts and
deans and depa_rtmental chair-
men, also changed probation and
dismissal" policy. The 1966-67‘

 'oo1 _of f Liberal Arts’ Bulletin,

. ., . VF‘

viously included probation and
dismissal policy will no longer
be published.

Distribution requirements “will
be met‘ by taking 14-15 credits in
each of the three divisions, with
the credits taken from \a mini-
mum of three departments,” Dr.

ehl said. This means that ‘a
student may ﬁll his humanities
distribution requirements by tak-

ing three courses in English, one

in classics and one in music. An-

other student may prefer to take _

two courses in ﬁne arts, two in
philosophy and one in speech.
“These courses may be drawn

-from the series numbered 80 and

 
 

speciﬁcally accepted by the School
of Liberal Arts as meeting the
distribution requirements.” Ad-
ditional distribution courses will
be offered in the coming trimes-
ters as each department adjusts
to the new plan and allows for
curriculum changes.

Dean -Kehl continued, “These
courses will include the 70-level
courses for students selected for
honors work. In addition," the
ﬁrst two courses in a student's
major and in his related area
will automatically be counted to-
ward satisfying the distribution
of studies requirement.” «

per‘ student (beyon-_d the fee
charged) for the entire under-
graduate body while preserving

private status in the graduate di- *

visions. Low tuitionfees for the
student, comparable to those of
Penn State, would result.

If the plan were accepted pre-
ference would be given to Penn- \

cludi-jng others; the size of the

ditional students in the next en-

would have to accept three Trus-
tees appointed by the Governor.

Financial Aid Increase
' By EILEEN DAVIS

The University will offer increased ﬁnancial aid to quali-
ﬁed commuting freshmen next year, according to Jack P.
Critchﬁeld, Director of Admissions. This is one of several
emergency measures undertaken by admissions and housing
departments to meet an estimated 952 bed shortage.
_ Admissions hopes to, attract 300 additional commuters
so that next year's freshman class will have 800 commuters

and 8Q0 residents. This year 1,-
100 out of the 1,600 freshman
lived in the dorms.

The ﬁrst 800 accepted students
that want housing will receive
priority. These 0800 students will
be chosen in a purely qualitative
manner, according to Critchﬁeld.
He said that the most qualiﬁed
students will not be denied dorm
space, even ‘if they live within
commuting distance.

Admissions personnel are mak-
ing high school students and
their advisers aware of the Uni-
versity’s housing problem. They
are urging qualiﬁed students who
won't be able to live in the dorms
to attend regional campuses. All

—. transfer students will’ probably

have to live in off campus hous-
ing, .but no student from the
Pittsburgh area who is now liv-
ing in the dorms will be asked
to live at home next year, Critch-
ﬁeld said.

Critchﬁeld did not feel that
-these policies would hurt the
standards of the fall’s freshman
class, as no student will be ad-
mitted unless he is fully quali-
ﬁed. “The resident c1ass'will be
the best yet, since we are only
giving the strongest 800 appli-
cants dorm space,” Critchﬁeld
said.

More women will have to
“crowd” into the ‘dorms next
year according to Vice-Chancellor
Helen Rush. The housing depart-
ment will ‘convert some study
lounges tol bedrooms and- double
decker beds may be installed in
some rooms.

Miss Rush will employ some-
one. to line-up suitable off—cam-
pus housing for students. She

' said there will be no additional

dorm space" for graduate stu-
dents, and men coming from re-
gional campuses won't be guar-
anteed on-campus housing.
Applications for women’s hous-
ing will be -distributed earlier
this year to give women- now
living in the dorms preference.
Critchﬁeld. Vice - Chancellor
Rush, and Dean of Women Sa-
Vina Skewis felt no single factor
caused the housing shortage.

They noted not only has the size .

of the freshman class grown, but
the percentage of students re-
questing housing has increased.
The number of women graduat-
ing and leaving the dorms has

been consistently smaller than.

students from regional campuses
have also crowded conditions.

The University’s ﬁnancial prob-
lems have hindered building plans
for new doorms, and no ‘ new
dorms will be ready for over
two years, said Critchﬁeld.

The location of new dorms de-
pends on a broad pattern of edu-
cation that is still under discus-
sion. Miss Rush emphasized the
complexity of the housing prob-
lem and is Working closely with
the student housing boards. “We
are Working very hard in the
interests of the students and will
tell the students of our plans as

 _ ‘Liberal arts distribution and probation revisions by the Academic
ssembly show flexibility, concern for student opinion, and a bit of personal
ontact. The revisions have been long overdue and resulted from an
ministrative awareness promptedprimarily over the past year by con-
nual student and future pressure. p ,
_ Although the new rulings neither follow the exactlines of the Liberal
Arts Cabinet proposal nor of the Project Teach ideas, these groups prompt-
d the concern of the Academic Assembly. If it were not‘ for the work
ﬁnd” interest of these groups, the administration would never have realized
~‘-the need. *
‘A - ‘ Now the proposals are policy and these same groups can not assume Ag,»
,_.all ‘is well. They must pursue the implementation of these rules by con-
tinual pressure and interest. , '
They must push to get more professors to teach the greater number‘
of promised distribution courses; They must push to see that adviser’s do
“ not abuse these new rules as they have past ones. , -
' They must now use the administrative awareness to prompt, action
on student evaluation of professors and the use of some merit system for
, enure and promotion decisions: _ t _/
" V The changes‘ are long overdue, but so is the type of student interest
which prompted those changes. The two are interdependent; if the stu-

If a massive student turnout at the polls to- give the elected body a strong base from
hich to bargain and an obligation to serve the student body, not themselves or their
party. 

‘ A straight vote will not so much reflect a disbelief in altruism, but a neglect of the

basic needs for establishing an effective student government.

 

, Students have been cast from one crisis into another. The recently re ease ord"
“Foundation report on the University gives excellent guidelines for alleviating ﬁnancial
fstress, providing better facilities, and more professors. Yet, students, many of. whom
P came here because of the University’s private status, must adapt to a new environment.
A Whether the Ford report is followed in toto or not, it will undoubtedly be used as
aprime guideline for establishing a state-ﬁnanced undergraduate college..The students
9 may complain about the stereotyped drawbacks of state control and moan aldout the an-
lticipated lower admission standards. Yet, they must be prepared to adjust and see the
‘ peneﬁts as well as the drawbacks of such a plan. - '

 Of course, this all will take time. but the new modus operandi will be creeping into
if realization at a consistent pace. Dr. Wells noted the tightening of the University's in-
ternal structure and appropriate ﬁnancial adjustments. He also’noted the willingness of
faculty and administration to adapt. "

, While the students inevitably» must accept the new format, there has been a
basic oversight by the committee. In their survey they interviewed faculty, administra-
tion, and prominent community ‘people. Not once was there a reference to a survey of stu-
dent opinion or even that of student leaders. " A \' .
It is well to expect students to adjust because they are only transitory ﬁgures in

, the life of the institution. However, the report should‘ put more emphasis on the stu-
._¥jdent. The committee seemingly feels the stu dents" must take it or leave it; the students

; are only a commodity, if one -type doesn’t attend the institution, another type will. I

 This appraisal of the committee’s ne glect for students may be presumptuous, but
the focus of the report makes’ it an easily-drawn conclusion. We suggest that in.the C

ity policy is not an easy task.»
For the past few months the
Executive Council of the
School of ' Liberal Arts has
worked on its program to
revise distribution require-
ments and the Liberal Arts
Cabinet, under Student Gov-

’ ernment, have been re-evalu-
ating the distribution of .

»-studies program. Although
the Executive Council’s pro-
posal has been ‘approved by

the School of Liberal Arts,

it is‘ advisable to compare
the two suggestions.

The Cabinet‘ proposed that
a student take nine credits
in each of the three academ-
ic disciplines (humanities,
social sciences and natural
sciences) plus an additional
18 credits (floating—-18) in
any of the three disciplines.
This proposal was printed
and circulated among stu-
dents and faculty members.

When it was discussed at

the , Academic Assembly,
Dean of Liberal Arts. James
A. Kehl expressed his belief

that it was too “rigid.” To _

the contrary the cabinet’s
suggestion is more liberal
than the approved one.

THE APPROVED policy

A emphasizes breadth ~by‘"re-
quiring 14-15 credits in each ,

of the‘ three disciplines. The
Cabinet’s proposal allows a

student. to follow this pro- ,

gram or to specialize.

For example, a -political
science major» and history
minor must take 24 credits
in political science and 12 in
history. To fill his social sci-
ence distribution the student,
following the Cabinet’s pol-
icy, may choose one course
in sociology, one in history
of religion and one in anthro-
pology. If he wanted to ‘spe-
cialize in the social sciences,
to meet the floatin ——18 re-
quirements, he would take
courses in economics, two in
geography and two more ‘in

anthropology permitting him ;

to get.a broad background
in his field while, filling dis-

tribution requirements.

P.P.P. Forum Discusses

Problems of Professors,

SG’s Position on Campu

By FRED FRANK ’

While it was originally titled “7-Vhy Student Govern- .

ment,” the Pitt Progressive Party forum last Saturday
turned out to be a discussion of “Why A University.” While
there was debate over the role of Student Government (SG),

‘pressures on today’s professors and student-faculty rela-

tions where also much discussed topics./
Dr. Richard Cottani, associate professor of political sci-

ence, set the tone of the discus-
sion. He stated “that this is a
critical time in American educa-
tion. There is a trend towards
more bureaucracy and with in-
creased federal grants, the fed-
eralfgovernment has begun to
direct American education.”

In this critical time Dr. Cot-

tam felt that students must be- .
gin to exert pressure for smaller,

classes and better teachers.

At this point, Dan‘ Stern, a PPP
candidate for Liberal Arts sena-
tor, asked the faculty members
of the panel what they thought
of the merit system suggested by
the PPP. Under this system a
committee composed of faculty
and students would recommend
teachers for promotion and ten-
ure considerations.

‘Dr. Robert Avery, assistant
professor of sociology, comment-
ed that it is usually the chair-
man of the department who han-
dles promotions. “If the’ students
want to have a voice they should
get to the chairman,” he explain-
ed. “The major students in each
department should reﬂect their
feelings to the professor.”

The role of SG on World Affairs

was a topic discussed through-'

out the two and a half hour for-
um. Students and faculty discuss-
ed the pros and cons of SG mak-
ing public statements on issues
such as the War in Vietnam.

_Dr. ‘Avery advised that the
time spent on the Activities Fee
Allocations Co mm i t t e e shows

that SG has little opportunity to K

get involved in world affairs.
Dr. Berkowitz pointed to the
untouched issues on this campus:
“student honor codes and student
discipline committee. , Any stu-
dent can say what they want on

.Vietnam. The question for SG is
where does it stand on issues of

education,” he said.

A discussion came up on how
students should deal with the
University's administration. Mah-
mood Mamdani, PPP candidate
for SG president, felt “the price
of an extra legal measure by
students is a widening of the
gap between the students and
the second party.”

SG Senator John Ruskay look-
ed forward to the day when SG
will be established as the one rep-
resentative of the student body.
He claimed that Vice-Chancellor
for Student Affairs Helen Bush
had followed a policy of divide
and conquer with “nine” autono-
mous organizations.”

Dr; Berkowitz concured when
he said that the administration
has followed an “excellent po-
lic, of keeping student impo-

ten by dividing student control
amongst various student organi-
zations.

Problems in Format,‘ Personalities

Plague SUB SG Election Forum

SEATED, left to right, candidates Marty Engels
and Bill Lerach (Independent), Lois Brady and

By FRED FRANK

The Student Union Board Election Forum Mon-
day was plagued with problems of planning and
low level personality attacks.

Members of the Student United for Responsible.
Expression (SURE) stated that they weren't told
the format of the discussion until 10:30 Sunday
night.

John Loch, director of the Student Union, felt
“that it was only a problem of notiﬁcation and
difficulty in reaching candidates to conﬁrm ﬁnal
details. The candidates assumed that there would
be the normal procedure and the committee, in
striving to add something new, included the ques-
tioning of the candidates by the other candidates.”

A SURE spokesman said that they‘ had un-
derstood there would be. ﬁve minute speeches giv-
en by both the presidential and vice-presidential
candidate, to be followed by questioning from the
audience.»

However, the format on Monday was a two
minute speech from the presidential candidate
only and then cross-questioning by the candidates.
During the second half there were questions from
the audience. A /

At one point, Pitt Progressive Party (PPP) pres-
identical candidate Mahmood Mamdani shouted at
SURE presidential candidate Ralph Manning that
he “has no qualiﬁcations for the position.”

Manning responded that more than “powers of
self-expression” are needed to run Student Gov-

Mahmood Mamdani (PP), panel’s moderator
Ralph Manning, and Howard Ainisman (SURE)

ernment. Manning pointed toithe need forithe SG
president ‘to work with students and “get things
done.”

Several times during the forum, it became im- I

possible to hear Engels and Manning. Members
laughed "loudly as well as booed and hissed as
they spoke.

SURE vice-presidential candidate Howard Ain-
isman questioned the manner in which Marty

Engels, presidential candidate, listed his qualiﬁca-7‘ I ‘

tions. ‘‘Didn’t you delete something about being
chairman of the Able Party?” he asked.

Engels retorted that “it would have been easy
to run on the Able Party” and also explained that
members of SURE had asked him to run with
them. “But seeing party walkouts, seeing people
grading papers in SG meeting convinced me that
it was time to disband parties and to elect people
on merit.”

Engels asked mamdani, “if you stand for
courage and conviction, what kind of courage was

shown by Eric Stern's walkout or by PPP “walk-

outs at SG meeting?”

Mamdani stated that while the PPP endorsed ' ‘i

Eric Stern last year “Eric Stern was not a PPP
man. Jdhn Ruskay made clear that the PPP was
not supporting Eric Stern’s resignation.”

After the discussion on qualiﬁcations, ‘the

forum moved on to a discussion of the parking V a

situation, the proposed SG constitution and the
student prices at the Book Center.

with City Councilman Peter Flah-

sal can be presented to the City

By his discussions with Flah-

dents in advance what we can
accomplish if elected. We owe
students more than idle prom-
ises,” he emphasized.

‘By MAHMOOD MAMZDANI .
— The students are citizens of the University as much
as they are citizens of their country. Their rights and
heir privileges within the University must be protected
aslmuch as their civil rights as Ameri-ans. '

Funds raised by student taxation, for example, must
be allocated by student representatives. This is a con-

and the student body. It is from this point, and only
from this point, that a Student Government president
can proceed to deal with the administration.
1 One must realize that principles are important‘ to
 extent, but that practicalities of a situation must
i‘ be taken into account. Therefore, one must agree that‘a
compromise, in certain cases, would be essential. A case
in point is the allocations debate-—as I pointed out in
;, my Monday, Jan. 17, statement in The. Pitt News.
, My experience on the Allocations Committee has
fled me to believe that the administration at the Univer-
_”'sity is qualiﬁed in dealing with educational‘ matters.
",1-Iowever, because it is a bureaucracy, the students can-
:not always expect it to thoroughly understand their
problems. It is the job of the Student Government presi-
dent to articulate the conditions and the needs of the
’»student body. It is thepresident who should establish
an effective communication between the administration
and the student body. A responsible and reasonable
‘Iipresident can achieve this.
' I “7In order to bring about any change, the Student
 Government must go through every existing legal chan-
nel. If this fails, it may resort to an extra-legal measure
bin order to accomplish a legitimate change. However,
fthere is a price to be paid for such an action: an in-
’ creased alienation of one bargaining party from another.
Therefore, what the Student Government president
 must do is to provide initiative in expanding the legal
“channels and, as a result, minimizing the need for the
., use of extra-legal measures.
_ This need for expanded legal channels is served
by is one concrete and vital proposal embodied in the
[new constitution. This is the University Review Board,
composed of three student, three faculty, and three ad-
‘T’ ministration representatives. This board becomes the
 and the highest authority on /campus, with the right
to review cases of disputed academic. legal ,or disci-
-__p1inary decisions.
The University Review Board is a practical mani-
g-festation of the concept that the administration, the
faculty, and the students can, and must, work together
~ in areas of mutual concern. This is responsible change.

By RALPH MANNING

The basic principle of SURE is that more can be
accomplished in an atmosphere of cooperation between
students and administration than can be achieved
through a course of deliberate student antagonism. We
will try to develop an “air of trust” in our dealings
with the administration as long as this cooperation does
not mean the betrayal of student independence.

We believe that SURE is the only slate which can
deal with the administration in a‘ no/n-antagonistic

framework. First, our‘ slate represents a wide cross- _

section of the student body. We feel the qualiﬁcations
of the PPP candidates reveal their narrowness of view.
SURE does not have this narrowness of purpose. Our
candidates Ptovide a broad cross-section, and the ad-
ministration will have to accept us as the representatives
of ALL the students. They will not be able to dismiss
us as “the fringe elements on campus.”

To re-establish the atmosphere of “good faith” ides-
troyed by last year’s senate, we plan to concentrate in
the beginning days of our administration upon the
less controversial, yet vital, duties of SG such as the
naming of Cabinet officials, various chairmen of special
events, and the enactment of the less -controversial
planks of our platform such as the student discount
ticket committee for_ entertainment. events. A

Thus, ‘I hope to be able to build the conﬁdence of _

the administration in SG so that when the times of
trial and controversy arise, the administration will be
willing ‘to meet the students halfway, instead of mis-
trusting every move that SG makes. We go fortli to

the administration in honesty and good faith, without ‘
the PPP stigma of rabble rousing from the debacle of

the past year. I believe that much more can be accom-
plished when students and administration negotiate in
good faith than when each mistrusts the other.
Above all else, we will strive to maintain student
integrity. If the administration refuses to deal in good
faith with students, if they give the students less than

is equitable, I,will personally go to .the student body’

and expose the administration’s lack of good faith.

We believe that ‘fhalf a‘ loaf is better than none.”
But, if the administration offers half a loaf where the

students merit a whole;;f.'g._'_>ne,. we will ﬁrst take the half-

However, we will hiiever stop ﬁghting and never
allow the administration to forget that the students
deserve it. If I am elected president, SG will not be
my Student Government or the administration’s Stu-
dent Government. It will be your Student Government.

As Student Government (SG) president, when deal-
ing with the administration I will always, always con-
duct myself with dignity. I will act in a responsible
manner. Some people have interpreted this to .mean
that_I will not press hard enough for‘ student control
over certain areas. This is not true. ,

Conducting yourself in a digniﬁed manner is not
incompatable with striving wholeheartedly for student
control. Perhaps in, the next year an issue will arise in’
SG in which the Vice-Chancellor for Student Affairs
(Miss Rush) will refuse to recognize the actions of SG. -

If this happened my plan of action. would be some-
thing very similar to this. I would go to Miss Rush,
accompanied by a few outstanding senators, and attempt A
to explain, clarify, and deﬁne the issue underidispute
for her. If she again refused my request I would seek
the advice and support of other administrators.

I would ask them ‘to communicate their views to
‘Miss Rush and to perhaps set up a meeting of admin-
istrators to again discuss the issue. If after these negotia-

V tions the administration still was unwilling to recognize
the actions of SG, I- would return to ‘the senate and
ask the senate to call for a referendum on the issue.

A , Assuming that the students respond strongly in
favor of the SG position I would again return to Miss
Rush and her fellow administrators and ask. them to
reconsider‘-their decision.. _” ‘ A

A If they fail to reverse their decision I, as SG presi-
dent, would sanction, ‘organize’, and if asked to, lead ‘

- a rally to show the feelings [of the students. This ‘show
of force would not be permitted to degenerate into a,
name calling affair. ' .' ‘ ' .

Even at this stage I wouldn’t chastize "Miss Rush
personally, for to do so would only make -her opposi-
tion more adamant."The rally would simply be a show
of student opinion, force, and strength. '

It would not be a hatethe administration day rally. -

If after all this Miss Rush‘ and the administration still
refused to side with us there would only be two courses
of action remaining. Which one I would ‘choose to fol-
low at that time would depend on the circumstances
of the situation.

initiative while still learning the practical, day-to-
day aspects of the business. Consider the experi-
ence of Jim VWeston, who has been with Ford
Motor Company for three years. ‘

Jim. came to Ford in February, 1963. His ﬁrst assignment was in marketing
analysis where his principal job was " evaluating present and potential
dealer locations. For a time,_he also gained experience in the actual pur-
chasing of dealer locations. Later, an assignment forecasting sales and
market potential with Ford Division’s Truck Sales Programming Depart-
ment gave him the background he needed to qualify for his present position.
His job today? Only threeyears out of college, Jim is now a senior-ﬁnancial
analyst in Ford Division’s Business Management Department.

Jim Weston’s experience is not unusual. At Ford Motor Company, your

twenties can be challenging and rewarding years. Like to learn more about

it? Talk to our representative when he visits your campus.
