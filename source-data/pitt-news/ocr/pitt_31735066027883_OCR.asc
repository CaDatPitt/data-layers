  University Senate

seeks more minorities

Melissa Blackwood

 

Take a look around the next
University Senate meeting, and
you may notice a lot of sirrrilari-
ties between Pitt’s version of this
legislative body and the United
States’ version.

They are both composed pri-
marily of older, white men.

Unlike the U.S. Senate, how-
ever, Pitt’s Senate is trying to
change.

In an attempt to diversify its
membership, the University
Senate recently launched a cam-
paign to identify and target
female, minority, and young fac-
ulty members to run in its upcom-
ing elections.

“We’re being much more
pro—active this year,” said Senate
President Keith McDufﬁe.
“We’re actually seeking out
minority and female faculty
members who might be interest-
ed, and we’re calling them and

 

asking them to participate.”

McDufﬁe is also working
with faculty groups like the
Provost’s Advisory Committee
on Wonren’s Conoems and Equi
Poise, a minority organization, to
identify potential candidates.

However, many professors
agreed that the Senate has two
major hurdles to overcome to get
these groups to become active.
The ﬁrst is that service in the
Senate doesn’t count for much
when a young faculty member is
seeking tenme; the second is the
general lack of diversity among
the faculty as a whole.

According to University pol-
icy, tenure is supposed to be based
upon excellence in scholarship,
teaching, and service.

Many professors said that
over the years, however, increas-
ing emphasis has been placed on
research and publication. As a
result, young faculty seeking
tenure concentrate on research.

Each night in the computer
labs, bleary-eyed students tap out
forlorn letters to faraway loves,
united only by electric impulses
and the thousands of miles of cable
that carry them.

Telephones connect voices
from campus to campus, but the
long distance calls add up until the
connection is shut off.

Many students live only for
weekends or holidays to see their
boyfriends or girlfriends again.

All across the country, college
life casts lovers apart. Availability
of things like e-mail and intemet
chat rooms have rrrade long—dis-
tance relationships more abundant
than ever.

 

Unfortunately, the increase of
long-distance romances results in
loneliness and tension for many of
the people involved in them.

“I’ve see more students dating
people who live in other cities or
states than ever before,” said
Penny Crary, director of the stu-
dent counseling center.
“Relationships are complicated
anyway. Finding a partner you’re
comfortable with is not easy, but
distance only makes things more
difficult.”

College life can make it even
harder. Tuition bills eat away sav-
ings accounts, and before e-mail
students could only rely on snail
mail to carry their words to their
beloved.

“People are even having com-
puter relationships to get around

[any ﬂwtcmce faae _E'

Why do we do this to ourselves? God only knows

that,” Crary said. “Students can
use e-mail to send a letter within
minutes, and that seems to sustain
a lot of relationships from campus
to campus.”

A computer lab consultant in
Benedum Hall agreed.

“You should see it. On Friday
nights people are still lined up
writing e-mail to each other or
talking in a chat room,” he said.
“You’d be surprised how many
people do it.”

Though communicating as
often as possible is the best way to
relieve strain on a relationship, the
weaker ones still fall apart.

“Newer relationships seem to
be the most diflicult to sustain,”
Crary said. “There’s no history,
nothing to hold onto. But long ties

City councilman

V Plagued by attacks on his personal
problems, City Councilman Joe Cusick
has announced that he will consider a re-
election bid in the May 20 primary.

Cusick said he feels that he has over-
come the problems of his past, including
bouts with alcoholism and media reports
of possible drug_ abuse. The councilman
has also missed a number of city council
meetings during the past year and has
begun the long process of making
amends for- his mistakes.

Many people say Cusick is incom-
petent, and that _most of his “achieve-
ments” while in ofﬁce are the result of
the work his staff has done —— not him.

Meeting this criticism and moving
forward is the next step on Cusick’s
rocky road of politics.

“I reconsidered my decision not to
run,” said Cusick, “because that decision
was at a time in my _life when I had hit
rock bottom.”

Regardless of his decision, Cusick
said he will not seek the party nornina—
tion for the primaries.

Arriving out of alcohol rehabilita-

tion for a city council vote on January

17, Cusick has since labored to get back
to the task of being a councilman.
Cusick said that his constituents want
him to run again. He said that to ignore
the phone calls he receives would be

_ unfair to himself and unfair to them.

Welfare reform

 

Get a job; take responsibility for your
life; and look at your watch, because “the
clock is ticking” is the message being sent to
welfare recipients.

On March 3, a new law will make it
tougher for people to receive welfare, unless
the government is sure they are looking for
work.

Work opportunity, personal responsibil-
ity, and time limits are the key components
of the new welfare bill.

The new Pennsylvania plan, mandated
whenfederal welfare legislation was passed
and signed into law Aug. 22, 1996, is called
Act 35. The federal legislation is known as
the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Act and ends Aid to Families
with Dependent Children as an automatic
entitlement, establishes time limits on cash
assistance, and toughens work requirements.

These requirements include work activ-
ity participation,such as on the job training,
community work and pursuit of GEDS. A
lifetime limit of ﬁve years is imposed on all
welfare recipients. '

Recipients must start looking for work

 

 

THE PITT NEWS

says alcoholism won't keep him from re-election

Cusick returned from alcohol reha-
bilitation to an onslaught of accusations
that he could no longer be effective in a
council position. Some ofﬁcials said this
rehab, his fourth overall and third since

taking ofﬁce in 1994, proved once and for p

all that he couldn’t handle the job.

Cusick said he can prove them

wrong. But some of his statements seem
less than conﬁdent.
‘ “I’mnot going to say I am sorry; I am
not going to say it’s not going to happen
again,” he said, resting his elbow on the
table in front of him and jabbing his ﬁn-
ger forward. “I am going to show you
that’s how committed I am this time
aroun .”

He stated that before he decides on
another run for ofﬁce, he will take every-
thing into consideration, gauge public
opinion, and see if he can keep doing
what it takes to maintain an office on the
ﬁfth ﬂoor of the City County Building.

Cusick said he would be ready to
ﬁght for a re-election, but no swings have
been swung just yet. He has sworn he will
not enter the race for re—election with the
mindset of a loss.

Personal attacks, public problems

“This election right now is about how
‘bad we can beat up Joe Cusick,” said
Cusick.”I hope that in the next coming
weeks that the candidates will talk about
the issues instead of Joe.”

‘Sitting askew and resting his arm on
the back of his chair, Cusick said the
media and fellow politicians have
launched a strong-assault on him, and not

the issues which he has tackled during his
time in office.

“Fine. I myself may have given you a
reason maybe not to vote for me, because
of the personal problems in my life,” said
Cusick. “But none of these candidates
have given you a reason to Vote for them.

‘‘We’re going to talk about the issues
 and I’m ready,” he said.

Through the assistance of his staff,
Cusick battled through his recent rehabil-
itation and was able to convince a review
panel that he was ﬁt enough to ﬁnish his
term as a city councilman.

Since then, Cusick has tried to trum-
pet the achievements of his ofﬁce through
the haze of controversy which has sur-
rounded him.

On a coffee table beside Cusick sits a
photo of himself and several of the other
Pittsburgh city councilmen at the 1994
Pittsburgh All—Star game: some smiling,
others cheering, and one holding a pen-
nant. Cusick said his legislation hasn’t
always made him a very popular council-
man with other people, though.

“I’m sorry I didn’t buy everyone an
ice cream cone,” he said, shifting in his
seat. “I don’t B.S. I don’t give [my con-
stituents] wild stories. I help them out.”

Recently, Cusick has been able to
negotiate a city—county deal providing a
much desired community center in
Overbrook. Pioneer Avenue in Cusick’s
district is seeing bond—ﬁ1nded reconstruc-
tions and improvements to the road sur-
face, sidewalks, and curbs.

“We’re doing a lot of different little
things that people don’t know about,”

 

Thursday, February 27, 1997

said Cusick.

And that is what Cusick said he’ll
continue to do, if he goes for another
term.

“My plans are, if I should run  to
map out what are the priorities for coun-
cil district four,” said Cusick. He said he
wants to get the small but important
things done for his constituents along
with the bigger legislation.

Cusick has said that the communities
he serves and the staff in his ofﬁce
deserve a large portion of the credit for
the work he has done. Officials in the city
county building maintain that this is pre-
cisely the problem with Cusick; that his
staff, not Cusick, has done the work.

And the councilman is the last person
to deny that claim.

“This staff has worked harder, proba-
bly, than any other staff on this ﬂoor,”
said Cusick. He said they were there to
pick up the slack that he had dropped and
he credits them, as well as the communi-
ty efforts in his district, for a majority of
his success.

Whether the work of Cusick’s
administration is enough to make him a

‘strong candidate for re—election is for his

constituents to decide.

To run, perchance to lose

The message of a loss in the primary
elections to Cusick, should he run, would
relay a hard message to his already
severely shaken term. ‘-

In the event of a loss, Cusick said his?
ﬁrst priority would be to place his staff 9

should guarantee people are looking for work

from the ﬁrst day on assistance. If they do
not find a job, they must participate in a
work related activity such as job training or
education that will make their job search
successful. Recipients who need job training
and education will receive help from the
state in the form of programs funded by fed-
eral block grants.

Opponents of the bill say there are not
enough good jobs available, and proponents
say there are plenty of good paying jobs.

David E. Epperson, dean of the School
of Social Work at the University of
Pittsburgh, sits somewhere in the middle.

He agrees that new plan is good, but
admits certain aspects of it still need work. ‘

He said the reform affects more indi-
viduals than any other social welfare legisla-
tion since the Social Security Act in 1935.
He said the political, economical, and social
attitudes in this country are conducive
toward welfare-refomr.

According to Epperson this is “not the
most desirable” plan, but if it is closely mon-
itored it can blossom into the kind of bill that
will help the needy and protect the children.
He said Americans need to depend on the
“sensitivity of humankin ” and continue
working towards a common goal.

The Institute of Politics at Pitt sumrna—
rized the new plan as follows: “Welfare in
Pennsylvania — and across America — is
marked by pervasive ambiguity; by a pre-
dictable mixture of hopefulness and pes-
simism, and by universal recognition that
the decisions of the next few years will have
immense impact on the real lives of millions
of American families in poverty.”

‘This is welfare-repeal, not welfare-
reforrn,” said Carl Redwood, assistant direc-
tor of Hill House, a community organization
which helps people ﬁnd work. A

Redwood is also spokesman for African
American Political Participation, a sub-com-
mittee of the Institute of Politics at Pitt, and
is composing a response to the plan to be
submitted to the Department of Public
Welfare.

“Welfare recipients need to be orga-
nized,” said Redwood. He added that if they
were thisplan would not have happened.
Recipients must have a voice in establishing
policy that affects them, he said.

Redwood said one of the problems is
that jobs do not exist. He said he believes
work is a crucial element of this plan. He
questions the Department of Public Welfare
and their ability to place recipients in jobs

and provide child care and transportation for
training and education as well as work.

Redwood said low-wage workers will
be squeezed out of jobs and the trend that
sees more employers using part-time
employees will increase, creating a class of
part time workers without beneﬁts or health
care.
‘The objective of this plan is not to put
people to work, it is to save money at the
federal level,” said Redwood.

Not so, says Claire Monison, director
of the Allegheny County Assistance Office.
Morrison said there has been an employ-
ment training staff at ACAO since the
1980s.

"Thirty percent of our case load are in
jobs now,” Monison said.

The unemployment rate for Allegheny
County is 3.3 percent and four percent for
the city of - Pittsburgh, according to
Morrison.

Monison said the average rate of pay
for placements during the past 18 months is
$8.06 an hour and 60 percent include bene-
ﬁts.

_ “We have been successful ﬁnding jobs,
 and our case load is the lowest in 26
years,” said Monison.

“Secondly, I guess I would go job
hunting,” said Cusick.

Previously, Cusick served in the
United States Navy for several years as
an erlisted man until being honorably
discharged in 1987. As soon as he got
back to Pittsburgh, he jumped right into
the political scene.

He went to work for then-council-
man Michael Coyne and moved with
Coyne into the prothonotary office as
deputy prothonotary until seeking office
himself.

He said his political career has been
his life and he could not imagine doing
anything else right now.

“Some would say that’s sad,” he
said. “Others would say that is commit-

Interpreting a loss in a re—election
run would be extremely difficult, said
Cusick.

His voice lowered and became emo-

“It is the people’s choice. And after
you’ve been through the things that I’ve
been through in the last couple of years, I
think it needs to stay the people’s
choice.”

Cusick was silent for a brief
moment, his hands placed palm to palm,
his gaze dropped to the table in front of
him.

He said he thinks it is too late to
worry about the media and different spe-
cial groups, and stated that the people
will vote how they want to.

“If they choose not to put me back
there, I will live with that choice,” Cusick
stated.

He was silent, his usually flowing
speech halted by the thought.

“I know that I’m not always right. I
think I have proved that.” said Cusick.
Still, Cusick said he will not walk out of
his office door for the last time in embar-
rassment.

“I am not going to leave this ofﬁce

are met.”

Possible faculty reductions

FAS is not the only school facing pos-
sible faculty reductions, though other
schools do not seem as worried about cuts
to programs and graduate departments.

“A major issue in the plamring for
each school is establishing an appropriate
faculty size, and in almost all cases, that
size is likely to be no larger than the pre-
sent size,” Maher said. “I don’t expect very
big changes in faculty size, but I do expect
a clearer analysis of the faculty hiring deci-
sions in the light of the resources that will
be available to the schools.”

Maher said that having a smaller fac-
ulty would mean that schools’ ftmds would
be spread less thinly’ in terms of money

available for individual faculty endeavors. ‘

“If they can run their programs well
with a slightly smaller faculty, then I would
like to make the resources available,” he
said.

Carter could not say if he expected the
number of faculty teaching CGS classes or
the number of classes offered to go down
because he had to speak with the other
schools.

The deans of engineering and business
said they are not expecting faculty cuts in
their areas.

“That’s not in the directives,” Blair
said. “I don’t think there will be directives
to reduce faculty. The provost  might
want us to cut back our general operating
costs, and then it would be up to us [what

THE PITT NEWS

was cut]. We’re not assuming that it will be
a drastic cutback sort of situation.”

Holder said that faculty in engineering
are also safe, because the school has creat-
ed a new department that will increase
undergraduate enrollment by 30 percent.
The problem then will be re-allocating
funds to hire faculty to teach those courses.

“’Ihere’s a re—allocation of faculty, but
not a reduction,” he said. “We have six
departments and several programs, and
there’s a faculty size in each program,
which goes up and down depending on the
enrollments in the programs.  We also
created a bio-engineering program in the
school last year, which will have to be
staffed from the new faculty that we hire
[and pay] from the resources that are avail-
able within the school.”

The law school may not be so lucky.

“We don’t know anything until it hap-
pens,” Shane said. “Next year, for a num-
ber of reasons, the size of tenure-track fac-
ulty will be a little smaller than it has been.
It is likely that we are going to try to trade
off some of the resources that we have
spent on faculty size to put toward some
other [projects]. We are trying to reach an
agreement with the provost’s office.”

Shane did not indicate whether faculty
would lose their jobs or if open positions
would just go unﬁlled. He did say that
another consideration would be deciding
whether its student body should be small-
er.

“I expect this year’s first year class
will be smaller than the first year class we
admitted last year,” he said.

Planning in schools outside FAS

The process in the engineering, law,
and other schools that report to the provost
resembles the process in FAS, without the
advisory committee helping the dean decide
which graduate programs may be reduced.

“From our point of view, the March 1
proposal is really an annual exercise to
make a report of the progress of our long-
terrn planning,” Shane said.

Each school has its own Planning and
Budget Committee. The PBCs include

elected faculty members, students, and a

staff member. The deans and the PBCs draft
ideas of possible long—term plans for the
school. The drafts are then revised by the
deans in consultation with committee. After
receiving PBC approval, drafts are shared
with the rest of the faculty.

The drafts also take into account the
actions by other committees within the
school.

“The process builds into it a lot of deci-
sions by other committees,” Shane said of
the law school. “For example, we have a
library tech committee. They might recom-

I mend a direction for the library.  That bud-

get tries to take account of the committees’
actions. The process of planning goes on all
year. Every year, we try to take stock of
where we are and make a report to the
provost.”

Holder said engineering’s PBC met
this week to discuss the plan and ﬁnalize it
by Monday.

"The chairmen also have big role and
have the greatest familiarity with the way
the budget is spent in the schoo ,” said

Holder.

Some schools’ plans include funds
from other, non—University sources and for
possible future deals and resources.

“We really thought [of it as] a good
opportunity to take another hard look at
everything we’re doing,” Blair said. “We
know we can’t get signiﬁcant increases in
support from the University, so our plan
focuses on additional resources. Every
organization should have its future direc-
tives under review at all times. We’re pretty
much on target.”

The process in CGS is more cornpli—
cated because the school draws its faculty
from other schools within the University.
Carter said the proposal is being formulated
with help from a council of faculty from the
various schools that teach CGS classes.

The six health science schools do not
report to the provost, and any budget pro-
posals in that area are handled by Thomas
Detre, the vice chancellor for health sci-
ences.

“We will have a budget that will be
due, but we do that through the health sci-
ences,” said Clifford Brubaker, dean of the
health and rehabilitation sciences.

None of those deans knew if there
would be faculty reductions in their areas,
but most didn’t expect any.

“I think that that’s probably going to be
happening in selected areas, though not nec-
essarily as a decrease in our school,” said
Brubaker. “I would doubt that we would
have very much of a change from our pre-
sent faculty for this year, whether or not that
is true in years from now, I can’t say.”

Diversity

“There are unwritten rules that you
spend your time initially developing a
national and international reputation,” said
psychology professor Sharon Nelson-
LaGall, a fonner committee chair in the
Senate. “I can make a bigger splash sooner
through research than service on the
Senate.”

Senate member and literature professor
Philip Wron agreed. ‘They know what
counts heavily,” he said. “Service on the
Senate takes time away ﬁom research and
publication.”

In addition, McDuﬂie said the Senate
needs to change the perception that it‘focus—
es mostly on the needs of senior faculty
members, such as retirement beneﬁts.

“We deal with issues important to
everyone,” McDuﬂie* said. “As the
University cuts faculty, and tenure becomes
harderandhardertogetretirementfor
example, is going to open up spaces for
younger faculty.”

'I‘hisisnottheﬁrsttimetheSenatehas
tried to increase diversity among its mem-

Jen Campbell, a Pitt pharmacy
major, slumps down on her bed in Lothrop
Hall at the end of a bad day and waits for
the phone to ring. The second hand ticks by
with the hour hand on her clock, but the
phone remains silent.

The walls are dominated by pho-
tographs of her boyfriend, Joe Tota; her
shelves are littered with ornate frames sur-
rounding images of the two lovers. Some
are of the couple together; in some he
stands alone, stoic and solemn in his
Marine dress blues.

One of his many letters is tacked above
her desk, and hundreds more sit in the
drawer. The return address on each is a
Marine base in North Carolina.

She said the letters are the only thing to
comfort her when she misses him.

“I can’t call him,” she says. “I never
know when he’ll be near the phone at his
base. He has to call me, and sometimes I
just sit here and miss him so badly. But
there’s nothing I can do about it.”

.Ien and Joe have been together for two
years. She graduated 21 year ahead of Joe
and said it was bad enough leaving him for
college. It was worse when he left for Parris
Island last spring.

Soon he’ll leave for six months of duty
in the Mediterranean. Jen won’t see or hear
from him during that time except in letters.

Still, the two are planning to get married.

“He was gone for three months in
training and all we could do was write,” she
saidlwasscaredtoseehimafterhegot
back because I was afraid he would have
changed and I wouldn’t know him. I don’t
know what it will be like when he goes
oversees.”

That changes of two people who are
far apart is the downfall of many long—dis—
tance relationships, according to Penny
Crary.

“Sometimes you’re not a part of the
other person’s life, and we are always
changing,” Crary said. V “Two people far
away from each other will change in differ-
ent ways, ways that may make them unable
to be together any longer.”

But Jen and Joe compensated for their
separate lives by writing — writing a lot.

“I wrote him a letter every day, just to
tell him what was up and what I was
doing,” she said. “It was like keeping a
day’s journal, just so we’d stay close.”

She said Joe’s training kept him from
responding to every letter, but he managed
to write her back three or four times a week.

“We don’t write that often anymore,
but he can call me now that he’s out of
training, and we talk as often as possible,”
she said. “It’s nice to hear his voice. That
brings you closer. But our phone bills are
around $200 a month.”

She said this is an incredible strain on
her fiance because he just purchased a
car—— and an engagement ring.

Long distance

‘ ple who haven’t got a steady career yet,”

said Crary. “If two people who live in other
cities have good jobs they can afford to call
and visit each other. But college-aged peo-
ple don’t have that option, and it’s the little
things, the small everyday details they
miss.”

The inability to see each other creates
problems of jealousy and mistrust for some
people. These two things often cripple an
otherwise healthy relationship.

Things fall apart

Bryan N iederberger’s been in two
long-distance relationships since he came
to Pitt, and both eventually collapsed.

The first was a high school sweetheart,
and when they both graduated she went to
Philadelphia and he came to Pittsburgh.

“It worked out for almost two years,
but when your relationship is based on
phone calls and e-mail you start to lose a
feel for what it was like to be with them,”
he said. “You just  grow apart.”

The other relationship was with some-
one Niederberger met on Semester at Sea.

“That fell apart just because we didn’t
have that much to talk about once the trip
was over,” he said. “I didn’t know that
much about her past, or what it was like in
Califomia where she lived. I’d been
through a lot with my previous girlfriend,
and it was much easier to commit to her
over a long distance because we’d shared
so much. VV1th the other girl, we were vir-
tually strangers once the trip ended.”

THE PITT NEWS

Though he could stay in touch with his
girlfriends rather easily through e-mail and
phone calls, Niederberger said it just wasn’t
enough to sustain them. '

“It was nice to get messages, but if
there was ever a problem and one of them
needed to talk about something, I didn’t
really know how to relate to it,” he said. “I
couldn’t tell her what to do about a problem
with one of her friends because I didn’t
even know the person. We simply lived dif-
ferent lives, and eventually stopped being a
part of each other.”

These are common problems facing
long distance lovers. But in Niederberger’s
case, the break-ups were eased by the dis-
tance.

“We lived such separate lives that there
were no friends to get caught in the middle
of a messy break-up,” he said. “There was
no real loneliness because we were never
together anyway, and we both just sort of
moved on.”

But some people’s lives are crushed if
they cling too long to a relationship that’s
slowly dying. The inability to let go can
turn to bittemess and rage that’s only 1r1ag—
niﬁed by the distance.

Such is the case with “Roger,” a Pitt
student who asked not to be identiﬁed.

Like many freshmen, Roger came to
Pitt hoping his high—school romance would
last until he graduated. ‘

Several e—mails daily, phone calls, and
visits to his girlﬁ'iend’s school kept the rela-
tionship healthy for a while, but Roger said

 

 

his girlfriend’s inability to deal with the
time they were apart made the relationship
a living hell.

“Yeah, talking over the phone or on the
computer was impersonal, but that was
enough for me. The problem was she con-
stantly needed contact no matter what it
was. Ifl didn’t send her an e-mail at a cer-
tain time of day she would get angry, and
we’d get in a ﬁght,” Roger said. “It was

.really hard to make up without being face

to face, but it was easy to keep arguing.”

In two years, Roger said the couple
spent more than $1, 500 dollars calling and
visiting each other.

All of it got to be too much for both of
them. g

Roger said he felt she was insecure
because he had had other very serious rela-
tionships, but her ﬁrst had been with him.

“She saved herself for the person she
thought she’d spend the rest of her life
with,” Roger said. “I was the ﬁrst person
she’d ever been serious with, the ﬁrst she’d
ever slept with, and I think she was insecure
about whether we would last.”

Roger said the pressure she put on him
to keep in touch with her often drove him
away.

Things got even worse when she had
to have surgery, and the long distance kept
him from visiting her.

“I just couldn’t get away, and she was
furious because of it,” he said. “She didn’t
understand how hard I tried. Since she
couldn’t relate to the responsibilities- I had

here she never understood why I couldn’t
make the trip.”

, When she got back to school she slept
with another man to spite him, and Roger
said his trust in her was shattered.

“I really loved her. I would have done
anything for her,” he said. “When we were
together we could get through any problem
 but being apart like this made it irnpossi—
ble to understand each other anymore.”

The two were strong enough to get
through that time, but since then many
minor arguments have slowly driven them
apart.
After months of angry, tearful late-
night phone calls and the long intervals
between visiting each other, the two decid-
ed to see other people.

“I was never really crazy about that
idea, though,” Roger said. “I only wanted
her. I still do. I’m hoping we can get
through all of this and ﬁnally be together.”

After the toll this relationship has taken
on the two lovers, however, he says those
dreams of being together after they gradu-
ate are nearly gone.

But for every miserable experience
one couple may have, there are some who
survive the distance. Some even say it’s one
of the best ways of discovering whether
two people are really in love.

“People only need to talk about things
that bother them, and things that they both
enjoy and remember about being together,”
said Penny Crary. “If the relationship will
last, it can last on your wor

THE PITT NEWS

 

 

Can't we all just
get a job?

Welfare reform has hit Pennsylvania and will go into
effect on March 3. The law, Act 35, is a response to federal

legislation, the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Act, which replaced the Aid to Families with
Dependent Children Act.

Both the federal and state legislation limit the amount of
time a person can receive welfare, place requirements on the
recipients, and offer education and job training incentives.

The new Pa. law has both good and bad points. Let’s go
through it step by step.

First, recipients are required to look for work from their
ﬁrst day of assistance. Now, there are some problems with
this that might be alleviated if further programs were put in
place. Yes, there are people on welfare who are capable of
working and have no outstanding responsibilities, who war-
rant being forced to look for a job. However, there are peo-
ple on welfare for whom this is just not possible.

i There are "single mothers with small children who
receive welfare. These mothers simply cannot afford to
work and pay for child care. It might be acceptable to expect

.them to work if provisions for child care were put into

effect. Also, there should be an allocated amount of time
during which women who have just given birth would not
be required to work _or to look for work.

There are also people on welfare who are either physi-
cally or mentally disabled. That is what keeps them from
working. Will the elderly and the sick be kicked off welfare
if they do not have the ability to work? This needs to be
addressed. .

Second, if a welfare recipient cannot find a job, he will
be required to participate in job training and educational
opportunities provided by the state through federal block
grants. This is best part of the new law. Job training and
education are the stepping stones that allow people get jobs
that will not only provide for them but also be worthwhile
career opportunities of which they can be proud.

Third, the new law institutes a lifetime limit of ﬁve
years on receiving welfare. This is the worst part of the law.
-If someone cannot find a job, but is trying, then he should-
n’t be kicked off welfare. There are only so many job oppor-
tunities out there, and no one should, be punished for the
lack of opportunities afforded to him. If someone can
demonstrate a substantial need and prove that he is trying to
get a job, then he should receive assistance until a job
becomes available. "

The new welfare law is a start towards reform, but it has
its ﬂaws. Job training and educational opportunities are true
reform. They are a steptoward fixing the ﬂaws in the wel-
fare system.

In my column last week, I said
I was going to tell it like it is, give
you the complete truth. The
response I received from various
people was quite mixed Some
people I knew thought it was a
great, new, and different idea.
Others were not so positive. A girl
whom I’d never met before
approached me in the Cathedral, a
situation I nonnally don’t mind,
and was basically pissed off
becauselastweek,Isaidthatthe
Campus Women’s Organization
isn’t a governance group and prob-
ably never will be.

So this week, in response to
this CWO member, I’m going to
tell you why.

Now, the reason and rationale
behind this governance-group sta-
tus is not written to offend, pick on,
or make a judgement on this young
woman or her organization. At the
very least, I admire her conviction
and many of her organizations
successes. Now Campus Women’s
Organization is a student group
which has progressed distinctively
inthefouryearsthatlhavebeen
here. For the past couple of years,
they have been attempting to gain
governance-group status. If you are
not sure what govemance-group
status is, I will explain it very sim-
ply.

Governance groups are
allowed special privileges when it

Tecutlotow
(THE Haze)

comes to the allocation of the stu-
dent activity fee. The policies
which regulate the issuing of this
money do not all apply to gover-
nance groups or SGB as they do to
regular student groups. There are
no programming caps or recruit-
ment and meeting limitations for
governance groups, and they are
allowed more travel and other ben-
eﬁts. Each is assigned one board
member as a liaison, and each is
typically invited to attend a presi-
dent’s round table.

I believe there. are currently
only eight governance groups
including the newest, Business
Student Council. These groups are
the Engineering Student Council,
Nursing Student Association,
Academy Students of Pharmacy,
IFC, Panhel, Black Action Society,’
and the Resident Student
Association. Some of these are
governance groups due to the large
percentage of underrepresented
students whose needs can not be
met by normal status. Some are in
different departments or schools
with their own buildings, cafete-
rias, labs, etc., which are set off
from central campus, including
ESC, ASP, and NSA. Others con-
sist of just large organized estab-
lished groups such as IFC, Panhel,
or RSA. Other groups allegedly
got the status by chaining them-
selves to the mainframe and point-
ing up a fear of tlneats of racial dis-
crimination; an example would be

CWO will never be Cl governance group

BAS.

Now, knowing the reasons for
the status of all other governance
groups, where is the rationale for
allowing CWO this-status? There
really is no good rationale. CW 0 is
an organization that puts on good
programming, events, marches,
and student activism quite eﬂi—
ciently. They are a model of a good
student group, but unfortunately,
this does not necessitate gover-
nance status. Their claim of repre-
senting the entire female popula-
tion does not have any grounds,
largely due to their lack of in-depth
organization and many of the con-
troversial issues they stand for.
Also, if the University granted
them this status, they would have
to grant it to BiGaLA, Hillel, Asian
Students Association, and every
other ethnic group on campus.

.Although this would be good in

giving such active student groups
more money, it would serve to fur-
ther segregate the multicultural
aspects of this University, and
would therefore be self—destructive.

Now this might not be what
CW 0 or other student groups
seeking this status wanted to hear,
but it is the truth, and I am just the
messenger. _

Abu-Jamal case is a lesson in civil riglrtsviolations

   

. . ‘?‘>?:>.r.'.'->. :5. .

Once someone closes that door, there
is no sound. There is the sound of silence
in your cell.” Mumia Abu—Jarna1, an
award-winning journalist and political
activist, has been living a life of isolation
on death row in the “Supermax” prison,
SCI Greene, about an hour south of
Pittsburgh, since 1982. Despite this isola-
tion, Murnia’s voice reverberates through-
out the world through two books and
countless articles. During his time as a
radio journalist in Philadelphia, he was
known as the “Voice of the Voiceless” and
for his critical talk shows on issues con-
cerning race, police brutality and comp
tion, and poverty. In 1982, Mumia Abu-
Jamal was sentenced to death for the
shooting of police officer Daniel Faulkner.
The trial leaves open questions and issues
ranging from racism to poverty, from
shortcomings in police investigation to
major civil rights violations, such as denial
of the right to self-defense and the perse-
cution of Abu-Jamal by the prosecution
for his constitutionally protected political
beliefs. If his appeals are denied, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will exe-
cute — in the name of its citizens ——- a
man many consider innocent.

Overwhelming evidence of racism
and discrimination permeates the entire
case. The jury consisted of 10 white and

two black jurors, although 40 percent of
Philadelphia’s population was African
American in 1982. Judge Albert Sabo,
who has been ruling on this case for 14
years now, leads all U.S. judges in the
number of death sentences given out. Of
32 death sentences, 30 defendants were
people of color, of whom 27 were African
American. Eleven of Sabo’s death sen-
tences have been overturned because of
misconduct on his side or other constitu-
tional violations. Further, Judge Sabo
denied the necessary funds for investiga-
tions and expert witnesses, such as ballis-
tics and forensic experts.

Major shortcomings also exist in the
police investigation. Although at least ﬁve
witnesses testiﬁed that they had seen a
person rrmning from the scene, police
never followed up with an investigation of
these statements. Further, Abu-Jamal at
ﬂrat time supplemented his income by dri-
ving a cab and carried a weapon because
he had been robbed several times.
However, no ﬁngerprints were found on
the weapon; nor is there evidence that it
was actually ﬁred, nor did police test Abu-
Jarnal’s hand to determine if he had
recently ﬁred a weapon. According to the
oﬂicial medical exarr1iner’s report, the cal-
iber of the weapon with which the oﬂicer
was shot was a .44 caliber gun while Abu-
Jarnal’s was a .38 revolver.

There is also evidence of police rnis—

conduct.- First, Mumia Abu—Jarr1al was
severely beaten after his arrest and before
he was transported to a hospital, despite a
life threatening gunshot wound. Second, a
major piece of evidence against Abu-
J amal is his alleged confession in the hos-
pital. However, none of the police oﬁicers
present reported the confession until more
than two months after the incident. One
officer who had watched Abu-Jarnal the
entire time wrote in his notebook, ‘
negro male made no ' ‘ 
statement.”
Miraculously, he remem-
bered the confession in a
hearing in August 1995,
13 years later. Third,
Veronica Jones, a
defense witness who had 
testified against Abu-
Jamal in 1982, gave an
afﬁdavit stating that
police had threatened her and had otfered
her a deal conoeming an outstanding rob-
bery charge if she would testify against
Abu-Jarrral. She also testiﬁed that the
same deal was offered to Cynthia White,
the main prosecution witness. Before she
could ﬁnish her testimony at a new hear-
ing in October 1996, the police harass-
ment of witnesses continued when
Veronica Jones was arrested in the court-
room on an old warrant.

The civil rights violations in Mrrmia

   

Abu—Jamal’s case are countless. Abu-
Jarnalwas repeatedly removed from the
courtroom and therefore could not exer-
cise his constitutional right to self-defense.
His back-up lawyer prepared an inade-
quate and ineffective defense. The prose-
cutor unconstitutionally used Abu—Jamal’s
political beliefs — he is a former Black
Panther — in the penalty phase although
they were irrelevant to the charges. The
' ' ' ts violations, however, are not

"""""" " restricted to the trial in
1982. In a recent ruling in
a civil suit against prison
ofﬁcials, Federal District
Court Judge Donetta
Ambrose ruled that “state
ofﬁcials interfered entire-
ly with the counsel’s abil-
ity to represent Plaintiﬁ”
in the Post-Conviction-
Relief hearing in 1995,
because prison officials had opened Abu-
Jarr1al’s legal mail, copied it, and sent it to
Governor Ridge’s ofﬁce.

Given the facts of the case and the
ongoing harassment of witnesses and civil
rights violations by state ofﬁcials, a grow-
ing number of people believe that a new
trial is warranted.

On Monday, February 24,
The Pitt News revealed that
further allocations had been
made to the Governmental
Relations Committee to
ensure an eight member dele-
gation would be sent to the
United States Student
Association’s Ledgecon
Conference in Washington,
D.C. Student Government
President Justin DalMolin’s
vote earmarked $1,536 for an
additional three students to
attend.

While DalMolin’s com-
mitment to the advancement
of student rights should be
commended, his tie-breaking
vote to ensure Pitt’s represen-
tation on the national level
should be criticized.

This week and next, the
Pennsylvania Senate and
House Appropriations Hearing
will held on Pitt’s Fiscal-Year
1997-98 budget request. The
Commonwealth mandates four
types of appropriations. Three
types are labeled as “pre-
ferred,” and the fourth is clas-

Preferred appropriations are
those for the ordinary expens-
es of the executive, legislative,
and judicial departments as
well as any other appropria-
tions the legislature chooses to
deem as preferential.

Non-preferred appropria-
tions are those to the educa-
tional and charitable institu-
tions not under control of the
Commonwealth. These appro-
priations are made in separate
bills, as opposed to the
General Fund. Because non-
preferred appropriations are
subject to deductions due to
revenue shortfalls, competi-
tion for these state dollars can
be stiff. That is, there is no
guarantee as to what Pitt’s
appropriation will be despite
what it may have received the
prior fiscal year.

Pennsylvania ranks at the
bottom 10th of the nation in
terms of per capita support for
Pitt, as well as the other insti-
tutions of higher education in
the Association of American
Universities. State support of
Pitt, as well as the other non-
preferred (this includes Penn
State, Temple, and Lincoln
Universities) is decidedly low.
On average, our peers receive

 

37 percent of their revenue
from their respective states
while Pitt only receives about

18 percent. The result,
Pennsylvania’s public univer-
sities’ tuition is among the
highest in the country.
Though it is commendable
that Pitt has three representa-
tives on the USSA Board, it
should be the concern of the
GRC to lobby for advance-
ments on Pitt’s campuses
before it attempts to tackle the
nation’s students’ concerns.
Perhaps grassroots student ini-
tiatives should be implement-
ed to convey our needs before
our state legislators since it is
they, not the federal govern-
ment, that so directly effects
our needs on this campus.
Unfortunately, our needs seem
to be obscured by the GRC’s
desire for a ﬁeld trip.

Gross generaliza-
tions do students a
great injustice

I wonder about the character
of an alumnus who lumps Pitt’s
entire student body into one gross-
ly generalized “You.” “Your”
inaction, “Your” apathy, “Your”
maliciousness, “Your” ruination.

It sounds to ‘be like T.E.
Parhirn has fallen victim to the
stereotypical “Generation X” dis-
ease of blaming others for soci-
ety’s woes.

I agree with Parhim that the
students who were throwing food
out of the Towers’ windows were
terribly wrong. Their behavior
was immature and uncalled for.
Nevertheless, it was THEIR
behavior. One childish act, while
embarrassing, does not conderrm
the rest of the student body to sim-
ilar behavior. I fail to see how
Parhim considers throwing food
out of windows a testament to all
students’ apathy and inaction.
How did Parhim know that he
was the only person who called
the police? There ARE students
who are conoemed about their
safety, as well as safety of their
peers. If I had witnessed this
action, I would have called the

students would have done the
same.

Personally, I feel that T.E.
Parhirn has no call to “question
the constitution of undergradu-
ates’ and graduates’ characters.”
Parhim has no right to judge me or
anyone else at the University —— to
make unfounded accusations of
apathy and inaction.

Perhaps Parhim, high up on
his “Fortrme 500” pedestal, has
forgotten that a career does not
make one immune to fault, or give
one the ability to judge others. For
example, Parhim chastised our
University community for allow-
ing “bigotry and racism to remain
institutionalized.” Well, why then
did Parhirn point out the races of
the students involved in the food
throwing? Did the students’ races
make their actions any better or
worse? Why is their race relevant
at all?

I would suggest that T.E.
Parhirn take a closer look at his
own actions before judging others
so quickly. Maybe “Our” mina-
tion lies not in inaction, but in
harsh, stereotypical judgment of
others. Gross generalizations are
just as harmful as Parhim’s “apa-
thy.”

TPN: As a student at Nebraska, did you fore-

see a business administration major degree

leading you to where you’re at today?

SP: I majored in business and journalism, but

my ﬁrst love was the journalism. I wanted the
business background,

 

and I knew that whatever I did the business
would do me well. With the changes in col-
lege athletics, you need to be astute in the
business world to maximize your opportuni-
ties. It’s really helped me in a number of
areas. I didn’t foresee it being as great as it is,
but it was probably a smart thing to do.

TPN: What was the ﬁrst contact you had
with the vacancy here at Pitt?

SP: Basically I just made application to the
search committee just like anyone else
would in letting my interest be known. It’s
kind of funny that there have been a number
of athletic director jobs open over time, but
there weren’t a lot of them that interested me,
and Pitt interested me for a number of rea-
sons. We like the city, we like the school, and

tradition was key, because they know what it’s
like to win, the great feelingsabout being suc-
cessful and getting back to winning.
Sometimes if you go somewhere where
they’ve never [won] before they don’t have
the feel. For them it’s kind of a dream. here
it’s reality. I felt like this was the right situa-
tion at the right time. I had a great job at.
Nebraska and would not have left for just
any AD job.

TPN: Do you think that getting out in pub-
lie and making yourself accessible is
important to the position?

SP: I’ve tried to make myself as visible
and accessible as possible at all of our
events whenever I’m in town. And that’s
the part of it I love anyway, to be with

The Pitt News: How long
have you been going to Pitt
games?

Panther Paul: I’ve been attend-
ing the games since Sam Clancy
played here. I’m not exactly sure
what year that was, but it’s been
about 16 years.

TPN: And how long have you
been Panther Paul?

PP: I’ve been doing the Panther
Paul thing for about ﬁve years.

TPN: How did you start being

Panther Paul?

PP: Five years ago we were playing
Seton Hall at home in a close game
that we won on a Garrick Thomas
three—pointer at the end of the game.

During the game, the band played that
song and I stood up and did the arm

movements. At the next home game, I
did the same thing and people pointed at
me and started getting into it. Then Paul

Evans (Pitt’s head coach at the time) told

me that people wouldn’t see me there and

it’s a great place with tradition. A

that I should j
go down onto the ﬂoor. I asked if
that would be. OK with the cheerleaders,
and he said it would be. So I went down
every time since then when they play the
song.

TPN: Has your routine or dance changed at
all since then?

PP: When I started, I would go in front of
the Field House Fanatics section and do the
arm movements. Then I started running up
and down the ﬂoor along with the arm
movements, but I was told there was some
rule that only the cheerleaders could really
be on the court and I might get in trouble.
So I went back to my spot in front of the
Field House Fanatics. I lost 40 pounds
since last season, so that’s why I can do the
push-ups this season. I ﬁgure I’m trading
the nmning for the push-ups, so that’s OK.

TPN: So security at the Field House and
the Civic Arena have no problem with you
going down, as long as you’re in front of
the Fanatics’ section?

PP: Yeah, ever since that game a few years
ago when I ﬁrst went down, they’ve been
ﬁne about it.

TPN: Are you such a big Pitt fan because
you went to school here?
PP: “No, I didn’t go to Pitt. But I had lived

Pittsburgh my entire life and I

went to Point Park College. I like all col-
lege basketball, especially the Big East, so
I’ve always cheered for my local boys, the
Panthers.

TPN: How far do you travel now to get to
the games?

PP: I moved to Irwin seven years ago, so it
takes about 30 minutes to get to the games.

TPN: What do you do for a living?

PP: I’m retired now. I worked at
Westinghouse as a computer programmer
for 3] years, and I retired from there a cou-
ple of years ago. A year after that, I started
doing deliveries with my truck to keep me
busy.

TPN: Do you get free tickets for being
Panther Paul, or your front—row, center-
court seats?

PP: No, I pay my money every year. I don’t
get the good seats for being Panther Paul,
either. That’s always been mine. A friend of
mine had it a long time ago -— in fact, he
had 17 tickets in the front row on both sides
of the aisle. He gave them up around 1981,
and I got them. The players and the scorers’

championships, and the other night shak-
ing the hands of the senior women’s bas-
ketball team. Also, -the men’s team on
Sunday. Those are the great things about
this job in my opinion. We want to reach
out more and more to the students. These
are their teams, and we want them to feel
great about that. They’re a part of what
we’re doing. Students affect the outcome
of the game, and if we have a close game,
the students can make a change in the
game. That’s the exciting part of it.
Sometimes people ask me what they can
do, and I say to them, ‘You can come out
and cheer.’ That’s the greatest donation
they can make. We don’t ask students to
donate a dime, but if they come and cheer
that’s the greatest donation they can make.

TPN: What role is former coach Johrmy
Majors going to have in the athletic depart-
ment? .

SP: He’s going to be working with me on
some fundraising projects and the chancel-
lot is going to have him on some projects
as well. He knows a lot of people around
here and he has a great reputation around
the city of Pittsburgh. I’m really glad he’s
staying around to help 
us. *

TPN: Can you explain 
some of the financial 
problems that you have 
inherited from the 
Athletic Department? 1
SP: Number one, it’s 
not untypical at major 
universities to have 
major support for the 
athletic programs.
When you go to the Big
10 schools with $35
million budgets, they’re
doing the same thing as we are. There are
only a handful of schools that can equal
their revenues with their expenses in athlet-
ics. It’s diﬂicult when you have a certain
number of teams and only a certain number
of tickets to sell.

I said from the beginning that our
expenses aren’t the problem, it’s our rev-
enues that are the problem. It’s contribu-
tions and tickets, that’s what we’ve got to
be ﬁxing. There ought to be great atten-
dance at all our events, and in the next few
months, we are going to lay out plans as to

what we’re going to do with these situa- ,

tions. This can lead to sponsorship dollars,
and the more people in the stadium the
more valuable your sponsorship and pro-
motions are.

TPN: From July of 1995 to June 1996, the
Equity in Athletics Report, what constitutes
“operating expenses?”

SP: Everything that goes along with that
team, from travel to equipment to scholar-
ships to salaries. For our sports, the expens-
es are evenly linked to the revenues. For
football and basketball, even through the
tough times, their revenues nearly take care

of all their expenses. The added expenses
come from the sports in which we are not
making much revenue.

TPN: Why do you think there is such a
great difference between the money that
coaches of men’s teams make compared to
what coaches of women’s teams make?
SP: In our case there aren’t a tremendous
number of variances in the salaries. But
where there is, we are adjusting that. We’ve
tried to value all sports and coaches in the
same realm. Obviously the market for foot-
ball and basketball is different when it
comes to coaches’ salaries.

TPN: Out of the $9.4 million in revenue
from men’s athletics, how much of that
comes from the big two, football and bas-
ketball?

SP: All of it. Almost all of it. I would say
that the revenue from the other sports
would equal the women’s. A lot of the
money comes from TV contracts and shar-
ing Bowl money.

TPN: The Convocation center is some-
thing that we can’t get a solid answer on
now, but what is the
proposed site?

SP: The proposed site is
adjacent to the football
stadium, but I have not
seen all of the plans. But
to my understanding it
would eliminate the
parking. With the
streets, it’s my under-
standing that there are a
few ideas about what
will be done with the
streets as of right now.

TPN: What are some of
the fundraising projects you have planned
for a Pitt who hasn't been really successful
over the past few years?

SP: A lot of it comes back to what I said
about ticket sales. Once we get people in
the stands it begins to solve our revenue
problem. And then fundraising increases
along with that. With success comes even
more opportunities, in addition to just
going out and asking people to help us out.

TPN: A lot of people have had a problem
with the fact that Walt Harris doesn’t seem
to stay at one job for a long time. Can peo-
ple look forward to having a coach for a
long time?

SP: He came here for the same reason I did,
to build a program. And that was one of the
things I wanted, building a program for the
long haul. Coach Harris has been to pro

football and had success in college foot-

ball, and he’s a college football guy. That’s
what he likes and that’s where he feels
comfortable. We’re going to make it a good
enough place that he’s not going to want to
leave. He and Iqare here for the long term.
We’re here to make this thing work.

THE PITT NEWS

   

The BIG Eusl Iournclmeni  

The Pitt News Sports Experts , profile the wide open

The Pitt Panthers (15-14, 9-7) are
staring at good news and bad news.
The bad news is that the Panthers’ only
chance to dance will be to win the Big
East Tournament. The good news is
that the conference tournament is so
wide open that Pitt could be playing at
the Civic Arena or another NCAA
Tournament ﬁrst-round location the
weekend of March 14 to 15.

Mark Blount and Gerald Jordan
are beginning to complement the out-
side threats of Vonteego Cummings
and Jason Maile. The senior longshot
artist is averaging over 50 percent
ﬁorn beyond the arc in the second half
of the season. A win at Syracuse on
March 2 could propel Pitt into the
Madison Square Garden with a full
head of steam.

Georgetown isn’t the team they
used to be. There is no more Allen
Iverson or Othella Harrington. In fact,
John Thompson is facing a changing
of the guard in the nation’s capitol and
the brunt of his firepower, sophomore
guard Victor Page, has entertained
thoughts of skipping off to the NBA.

The Hoyas stand at 18-8, 11-7 in
the conference, which looks good
enough for a possible at-large bid, but
if Page happens to stumble upon an off
day, Georgetown is in trouble. Ya Ya
Dia and Jahidi White aren’t the oﬂ°en-

struggle to win a game in New York.
In Notre Darne’s latest loss, the
Miami fans were chanting NIT. That

of postseason play, because they aren’t
going anywhere in the Big East.

Villanova has been famous for I

having a strong regular season, even a
decent to great showing in the Big
East Tournament, and then not show-
ing up in the NCAA Tournament.

Two years ago they fell to Old
Dominion in the ﬁrst round, and last
year they fell to Louisville in the sec-
ond round.

The ‘Cats are 19-8 overall and
10-6 in the conference coming into the
Big East Tournament. The up-and-
down boys ﬁom Philly have shown
signs of grandeur as the conference’s
lone Top 25 rep, but don’t forget the
monster whooping at the hands of
Kentucky a few weeks ago, followed
by the loss at Pitt thanks to a Jason
Maile 40-point performance.

‘Nova must get smart, strong

Tim Thomas has to prove he’s worth
every penny instead of talking the talk
and not walking the walk.

‘ Along with Villanova, the
Providence Friars (19-9 overall) are
the only squad guaranteed a slot in the
NCAA tournament, regardless of their
performance at Madison Square
Garden. A championship-garne victo-
ry on national television can only
impress the selection committee more.

Leading the charge will be Austin
Croshere — a virtual lock for all Big
East nominations. Eighteen points and
eight boards a game have been enough
to lead Providence over almost every-
body, and the superstar's 89 percent
free-throw shooting has frustrated
more than one Big East defender try-
ing to outinuscle the senior.

Look for this team in the ﬁnals if
Croshere lives up to his billing and
gets outside support from 3-point
bombers Jamel Thomas and Denick
Brown.

Rutgers lost their hero, Damon
Santiago, to graduation last season,
and they have pulled off less than their

Sophomore point guard Geoff
Billet is the lone bright spot for Bob

“When he spots up, even

They’d rather take a chance on

Uncle Sam has Cliff Clavin.

man in senior guard Jason
Maile, and boy, can he deliver.

While in high school, Maile
was recruited by smaller pro-
grams. Lafayette and Bucknell
were among the top schools try-
ing to woo him. But Maile want-
ed the opportunity to play for a
larger, Division-One school.

“I waited around because I
thought I could play at a higher
level,” Maile said. “I wanted the
opportunity. I knew every school
couldn’t get the top recruits. "I
knew there’d be some openings

second in the Big East. Maile is
ranked fourth on Pitt’s career

“He’s a natural shooter,”
said Pitt Head Coach Ralph

very good mechanics, and sec.-
ond, you have to be born with
the shooter’s touch. He has

The Pitt Lady Panthers travel to
Hartford, Conn. this weekend to
participate in the 1997 Big East
Tournament. _

The Lady Panthers, the 13th
seed, will tip off in the first game
this weekend at noon against the
fourth—seeded Lady Hurricanes of
Miami against whom Pitt is 1-1 this
year .
Last year the Lady Panthers sur-
prised everyone by advancing to the
quarterfinals against the host, The
University of Connecticut, after
being seeded number 13. They were
the first team to accomplish this feat
in the history of the Big East.

Pitt hopes that history will
repeat itself this year. After posting
a dismal 3-15 Big East record and
losing 13- of their last 14 games, the
Lady Panthers will need to come up
with “their biggest effort of the
year” according to their Head
Coach, Kirk Bruce, in order to rival
last year’s performance.

Pitt is coming into the tourna-
ment flat, and no one seems to know
why. Hopefully,_ this will be

Panthers can roar far into the tour-
nament.

Other matchups in the first
round include Boston College (5)
vs. St. John’s (12), Rutgers (6) vs.
Syracuse (11), West Virginia (7) vs.
Seton Hall (10) and Providence (8)
vs. Villanova (9). The number one,
two, and three seeds get buys. These
include Connecticut, Georgetown,
and Notre Dame respectively.

The University of Connecticut is
the heavy favorite in this tourna-
ment, and a loss would be almost
unfathomable. The Lady Huskies
have not lost all year and hold the
number—one position in the National
polls. They have a preseason All-
American in Kara Wolters and two
other All—American candidates.
There seems to be no stopping this
powerhouse.

Georgetown and Notre Dame
could also make some noise, but
UConn should walk away with the
title again. The Pitt Lady Panthers
will need hard work and a lot of
luck to repeat last year’s perfor-
mance, but they hope this will be
the case and that they can advance
even further.

table used to be right in front of us. So
when the referees would go over to the
table I would yell at them, which was fun.
But they moved it to the other side, which
most of the people like, since it’s easier to
see now. A lot of the people on my side
are just stuﬂ°ed shirts anyway.

TPN: What would it take for you to miss
a basketball game?

PP: [laughs] I don’t miss too many
games. I missed an Oklahoma St. game a
few years ago because I was helping my
daughter move. We were goingdown to
Maryland, and it started to snow on the
way there. It ended up being a huge bliz-
zard and I wasn’t able to make it back for
the game. Also, earlier this year, I was at
a wedding. That’s about all that could get
me away from coming to Pitt’s games.

TPN: How do you like Pitt’s postseason
chances this year?

PP: I think Pitt needs one more win to
make it into the NIT. In the Big East tour-
nament, we could win a game or two.
We’ll probably get seeded against Notre
Dame or Connecticut, which we should

win. But we’re able to beat every team in
the conference, and we’re capable of los-
ing to every team in the conference too,
so who knows? We might get really hot
and just sweep the whole thing. Who
knows?

TPN: Who on this team could you see
making it to the NBA?

PP: If Mark Blount keeps improving like
he is, he could have a promising future.
He’s been shooting the ball real well
recently. He only missed one shot against

"Connecticut; he went 7-for-8 or some-

thing. I think Blount’s better than Eric
Mobley was, and he’s still around.
Possibly Vonteego Cummings, too. If he
improves like he has been over the last
month, he has a chance. A lot of guys are
playing in Europe now, so it’s tough to
say.

TPN: Anything else you would like to
say?
PP: Yeah, I was telling my wife that I

could never rob a bank because someone -

would definitely know who I am.

MOONWALKING THE LINE B

GhettOriginal
brings hip-hop to
the stage

Jam on the Groove
Performed by
Productions
Presented by Pittsburgh Dance‘
Council

GhettOriginal

Hip-hop on Broadway? If
“Stomp” can make noise by dancing
on trash cans then I guess “Jam on
the Groove” can bring back break
dancing moves like the spider and
the windmill. The Pittsburgh Dance
Council is bringing in
GhettOriginal Productions to per-
form their urban acrobatics at the
Byham tonight. The lavish theater is
far from the city streets of New York
where hip—hop began, so graffiti
artist Erni Vales has designed a
backdrop to bring the audience into
the original setting of ghetto life.

These dancers can’t do body
rolls to a symphony orchestra, so
hovering over the dancers is DJ
Scribbles, who spins tracks of club
music. These alley cat dancers bring
old-school moves onto the stage as a
form of high art, having moved out
of their past stomping grounds of the
city. Members of GhettOriginal
began in dance groups that would
compete on the street and in clubs as

dance gangs. Does the “Fame” sce-
nario ring a bell? These guys are
bringing back the inspiration of hip-

hop style dancing with some updated
pop tracks. The dance artists from
Brooklyn were pioneers of the hip-

 

ETWEEN HIGH AND |.ow ART

hop movement. They label hip hop
as an American art form now that
they’ve taken out the street violence
that it has been denoted with in past
years.

Now out of the filthy streets,
“Jam on the Groove” has made inter-
national waves touring in places
such as Brazil, Israel, and Japan.
“Jam on the Groove” is so all-
American that they have the support
of Calvin Klein Jeans, who has cam-
paigned street kids as being fashion-
able and trendy. If you attend the
show check out the labels to see if
the dancers agree.

Along with moonwalking,
mimes and shadow jousting is a part
of this show that tries to get the
audience involved with the act.
Tours such as this break the barriers
of high/low art by addressing the
audience as though they are a part of
the performance. It’s a fascinating
experience since some of the season
ticket holders are retirees who are
totally oblivious to pop culture.
Bridging gaps between classes and
culture in sensational demonstra-
tions such as this one-is at the fore-
front of the nineties artistic move-
ment.

“Jam on the Groove” defies the
lines of contemporary dancing while
coordinating the images of the
street, stage, life. The show began
last night and will run till March 1st
at the Byham. Call 412-456-6666 for
tickets and info.

September Songs: The Music of
Kurt Weill

Directed by Larry Weinstein

With performances by Nick Cave,
Lou Reed, PJ Harvey, William S.
Burroughs and more

September Songs is a highly
entertaining and informative film
dedicated to the life and work of the
German-born composer Kurt Weill.
Hailed by critics and contemporaries
as one of the most important com-
posers of the 20th century, Weill was
forced to flee Nazi Germany before
the start of World War II. Labeled by

Hitler as a “degenerate” who was cor-
rupting the Aryan race with his
“Jewish jazz,” Weill went on to even
greater success on Broadway in the
U.S. before his death in 1950.

The film is presented as a series
of strange performances, ranging
from cabaret—style numbers by David
Johansen and Mary Margaret O’Hara,
to a funky electric boogaloo sequence
by GhettOriginal (see photo and
above story), to an a Capella perfor-
mance by The Persuasions. Almost
all of the pieces work wonderfully.

Nick Cave starts the film off with
a humorous take on Weill’s classic

collaborator

“Mack the Knife.” The whole thing is
set in a strange, eerie warehouse
space, with informative historical
information blaring out of mega-
phones occasionally. The voices of
Bertold Brecht and
Weill’s widow can be heard through-
out the film. PJ Harvey’s rendition of
“The Soldier’s Wife” is erotic and
hilarious. Charlie Haden’s bass
accompaniment of “Speak Low” is
sparse, moody, and amazing.

This film is visually stunning
(yes, this is a cliche). Certain shots
work better than others. The William
Burroughs sequence, as well as the

 

initial close up of Weill’s face are
wonderful. Almost every perfor-
mance evokes some element of the
era and the context in which4Weill’s
work originated. His work is con-
stantly being reinvented, as it will
surely continue to be well into the
future.

This film is the final installment
in this year’s Jewish/Israeli film fes-
tival, and well worth the watch.
Tonight’s 7:30 showing at the
Melwood Screening Room is the last
chance to catch it, so by all means, do
so!

Feather
International Poetry Forum
Directed by Jeff Howell

Samuel Hazo, state poet of
Pennsylvania, Duquesne University
English professor, and lover of all
things passionate, has written a new
two-act play entitled “Feather,” which
is being presented by the International
Poetry Forum. Hazo, who is also the
president and director of the Poetry
Forum, is perhaps best known for his
work on the city that he loves, “The
Pittsburgh That Stays Within You.” He
has also written plays such as “Solos,”
which also appeared with the Poetry
Forum 3 years back. I

Hazo marks his work with an undy-
ing devotion to Robert Frost’s distinc-
tion between a “vital” sentence and a
“non—vital” sentence. A “vital” sentence
is a sentence that grabs the reader,
makes the reader listen, and absorbs the
reader into the sincerity and power of
the sentence. Any sentence devoid of
this power, no matter how correct or
stylish, is simply not “vital” enough and
is simply not how Hazo writes. After
listening to “Feather” on an audio cas-
sette, I felt a “vitality” that made me

Thursday, February 27, I997

 

believe and be interested in the world
that Hazo created. On the surface, it is a
story that has been told many times in
many situations — the struggles of an
African—American woman who over-
comes all the obstacles that come her
way, and love conquers all barriers to
progress. But thevway the story is told,
with vigor, passion, and vitality, makes
it truly worthwhile.

“Feather” is being directed by Jeff
Howell and stars the Broadway actress
Maggie Stewart, along with Demareus
Cooper, Tome Cousin, David Early, W.
Ellington Felton, Dan Frezza, Amanda
Slaughter, and Kate Young. Adding a
musical element to the narrative is the
Jubilee Choir of New Light Temple
Baptist Church.

Feather is playing tonight thru
Saturday, March I, in the Carnegie
Lecture Hall. Performances are at 8
p.m. with tickets being $12. Student
tickets are$8. The performance on
March I will be interpreted in
American Sign Language for the deaf
and hearing impaired. Call the
International Poetry Forum at 621-
9893 for more details.

Graffiti rock challenge rolls on

Three down. Two to go. Every
Friday night in February, North
Oakland’s Graffiti has opened its doors
to new rock competitors who strum it
out for the l997 Graffiti Rock title.
Nervous bands with hopeful smiles rip
through chords and belt out lyrics trying
to catch the judges attention.
Pittsburgh’s music leaders mull around
the ideas and formulas of whatmakes a
good band. These ritual events raise all
kinds of controversy as people ask what
influences gauge success within the
music industry. a‘

The scene is electric and stands as
more than simply a competition.
Something unique happens on rare
occasions that make all the teeth-biting
worth while. Sophisticated bands like
On can play with happy grooving bands
like Push, and complicated bands like
Elektra Loves Daddy can perform with
simple star—gazing groups like Mad
About Madeline. This past Friday was
the perfect example of the concoctions
which can occur with Graffiti’s broad
spectrum of contestants.

Push brought their fan club this
time, raising the roof with the classic
tune “Coconuts.” Since they formed
from old members of Brownie Mary,
their set has matured and found its own
upbeat personality. On has fine tuned
their strings. Former members of the
Kelly Affair join in to make their act
more suave and sophisticated.

Much like upgrading a car, Elektra
Loves Daddy have traded in their silky-
voiced brunette for a sassy blonde,
which adds to their varied inﬂuences.
The busy stage was filled with band
members keen on their instruments,
each with their own energy. I heard jazz,
reggae, old rock, and pop hooks, all set-
ting off in a different direction, but still
able to pull it all together to become a
contender.

The stagelights painted Mad About
Madeline blue as they finished the night
with listless songs about depression and
longing. Part of a younger generation
just now experimenting with music.
Madeline exposed some of the judges to
the fresh face of music. Off—pitch with a
tight drum and guitar section, this type
of music reflects the college punk
scenes most affiliated with indie labels.
Lead vocalist Lisa wailed innocently,
her hungry heart bringing the band’s
music inward. They are just discovering
what it takes to get out there, to just do
1t.

Sometimes finding courage can be
the beauty of live music, which I’m sure
all the bands can relate to. This Friday,
Bitter Delores, Stone Soup,
Something Agnes, and Groove
Junkies play for the last round before
the finals next week. Last year’s winner,
the Vibro Kings, will perform as an
added element to the nights line-up!

lure of 44
The Anatomy of Sharks EP
Quarterstick Records

I once found a friend of mine standing in
front of my roommate’s bedroom doorway,
his eyes glued to something in there. I threw
rocks at his head, but his gaze would not
stray from whatever it was that was sucking
him in. Later, as I was cleaning the blood out
of his hair, he explained the situation. He had
stumbled across Paul in rnid-NordicTrac
workout. The ﬂuid motion of his legs and
arms monotonously pumping back and forth
had mesmerized my friend, taking him into a
world where it was just him and that hard,
sweaty body. The only thing that could bring
him back was the door slamming in his face.

Then there is the song “Boom” off the
newest June of 44 release. Listening to it, I
understood to how my friend must have felt
while examining Paul. Throbbing African
percussion beats force themselves into your
head where they stay trapped, pounding the
same rhythm over and over and over again.
You almost want the beat to change, if only
to be free from their siren—like powers, but
most likely not even this thought will be
allowed to penetrate through to your
absorbed consciousness and break the
trance. Somewhere behind these sounds lies

 

a trumpet crying, like it, too, has fallen under
the spell of its brother noisemaker. Although
it is loud, its effects are unnoticed like the
rock assault on my friend’s head The blood
is not felt until the journey back to this world
is made.

There are two more songs on The
Anatomy of Sharks EP that keep the hypnot-

ic effects of “Boom” in check. Both are stan— -

dard June of 44 numbers, relying on intricate
guitar and bass playing that weave in out of
each other over powerful drums and rrrini—
mal vocals. Sometimes hard and heavy and
at other times, quietly relaxing, the compli-
cated song structures always have you wait-
ing for what’s next.

The ﬁrst, “Sharks and Sailors,” had me
dancing after a few minutes of funky beats
and bass lines. This trades on and off with
some soothing instrumentals. The song tends
to drag on a bit in its ten—plus minutes, but all
in all, it is a ﬁne effort. The third is a short
rocker featuring vocals from their new
singer, the bass player from The Cmwnhate
Ruin. The songs serve both as an intro of
what is to come in “Boom” and as a pick-
rne—up to get your body up and moving
again. It will also keep your friends from
creeping around your house in search of hard
bodies.

The Empire Strikes Back
(Special Edition)

Directed by George Lucas
Starring Mark Hamill,
Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher

Star Wars was released in
1977 and instantly entered box-
office history. George Lucas
could breathe easy; his $10 mil-
lion space—fantasy gamble, rather
than prematurely ending his
career, had launched it into the
far reaches of the galaxy.

The question then remained:
what next? When writing Star
Wars, Lucas had chopped his
original story in half and focused
on the second part, then took that
second part, sliced it into thirds,
and ﬁlmed the first of those
three. He gave it a happy ending
of sorts — the destruction of the
Death Star — in case he never
got to ﬁlm the rest of the story,
but Star Wars’ success ensured
that Lucas could do what he
wanted from now on.

And what he wanted to do,
before moving on to the other
project rattling around in his
brain —-— a collaboration planned
with Steven Spielberg about a
rogue archaeologist named

Lucas’ first decision was to

The Empire Strikes Back —

corpse the second time around.

ﬁrmly in place as executive pro-
ducer to mastermind the entire
production from a distance, as
well as direct the special effects
work going on at Industrial Light
& Magic and keep the studio

execs from bothering Kershner. '

The result of this new organiza-
tion, ultimately, was the most
compelling ﬁlm by far of the
Star Wars trilogy.

Knowing that a third movie
was now likely, Lucas and
screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan
were free to construct a story that

Thursday, February 27, 1997

did not have a happy ending, but
rather left the fates of all the main
characters dangling as precari-
ously as Luke on the antenna
below the Cloud City. Was Han
frozen in carbonite for good?
Could Leia reconcile her reluc-
tant love for Han with her deep
bond to Luke? And, most gnaw-
ingly, would Luke fall prey to the
temptations of darkness like his
father before him, in the wake of
Vader’s revelation?

Star Wars’ main cinematic
strength was Lucas’ ﬂawless,
seemingly instinctive editing,
moving from one key story point
to the next without skipping a
beat. On top of that strength,
Kershner imbued Empire with a
visual aesthetic still umnatched
in science-ﬁction ﬁlm. Each
individual shot is perfectly com-
posed, from Luke’s icy vision of
Ben Kenobi and Han’s cornering
of Leia in the Falcon corridor to
Yoda’s frustrated gaze skyward
and Vader’s outstretched hand to
Luke. AKershner’s simple but
striking camera movements, like
Star Wars’ raw special effects
power, lose much of their effect
in the translation to television
proportions; a perfect example

comes early in the ﬁlm, when a
hard cut to a closeup of R2—D2’s
spinning antenna pulls back to
show how insigniﬁcant the little
droid looks in comparison to the
vast iciness in which Luke is lost.
Kershner’s luxurious direc-
tion renders unnecessary the sort
of large—scale ‘90s revamping
which made the Star Wars
Special Edition such a heralded
event, The added pieces in the
Empire Special Edition are small
but absolutely perfect: seeing the
Warnpa ice monster on Hoth ren-
ders Luke’s peril all the more
acute, especially during the now-
heart—pounding sequence when
Luke’s lightsaber is just out of
reach; and the replacement of
blank white walls in the Cloud
City with windows looking out
over Bespin opens up the space
to more properly convey the
sense of a real city in the sky.
The release of the Return of
the Jedi Special Edition has been
pushed back a week to March
14, to allow Empire a full three
weeks in the best theaters. Take
advantage of the extra week and
catch Empire under the best of
circumstances.
