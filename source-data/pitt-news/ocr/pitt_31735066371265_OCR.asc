GSPIA dean’ s
resignation

‘a surprise’

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

In what one professor called a
“surprise move,” Dr. John Funari
resigned as dean of the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs (GSPIA) Tuesday. Funari
was appointed dean June 25, 1974.

Dr. Leon Haley, associate dean
under Funari, will be acting dean
until a replacement is found.

Funari did not wish to comment

M on his leaving, except to confirm

I that he did resign. One faculty
member wishing to remain anonym-
ous, however, said. disagreements
within the school ledto Funari’s
resignation.

“I didn't anticipate his resigna-
tion. It was a surprise. I thought it
perhaps came prematurely. But
there’s been in-fighting lately, and I
could see how [that] could lead to
[his resignation]. The situation here
is rather polarized, politically. For

Q untenured people, the situation is

really unstable.”
Another professor, Robert Nor-

man, said Funari’s resignation came.

in the wake of a special meeting
attended by 27 GSPIA faculty and
staff members held on Friday, Feb.

’ 17. The meeting was called to discuss
the merits of a recent University
Senate proposal to establish a study
group analyzing the decision-
making process in GSPIA and
faculty participation in the process.
“Why did he resign? I don't

5 know," Norman said. “Was it in-

fighting? I wouldn’t use that phrase
to describe [Funari’s resignation].
The key thing is I think the dean lost
the confidence of a sizeable portion
of the faculty.

Bad choice

By Pe Feni
The Pitt ews

Pitt’s decision to return a $2 mil-
lion grant earmarked for the crea-
tion of a nutrition center, and to
dismiss its director, Dr. Robert
Olson, have left him “shocked and
disappointed.”

“An opportunity like this [to
secure funds for a center] happens

Qqpnce in a generation, and you don't
obliterate an opportunity like this,"
Olson said. “I think a terrible thing
has happened."

The grant was to be used to con-
tinue and expand the university’s
Heinz Nutrition Center. Olson had
written‘ the grant application at
Pitt’s request, which was reviewed
and approved by the Howard Heinz
Endowment. It was funded last July
1, on the grounds that (Olson) be its
director and principal investigator,
Olson said.

for the center without sufficient
time. Pitt, however, knew from the

outset the conditioning Heinz had
set down when it approved the
grant, Olson said later.

All plans for the center are on
hold until the university has had a
chance to ‘bring in a panel of
national experts to advise how this
program could be best implemented,
Detre said. The university will
reapply for the grant, he added.

The Endowment’s reaction to
Pitt’s decision to return the grant has
not been released.

Olson said he had no warning he

would be relieved of his duties‘ as

V center director. In an earlier release,

Olson called the action “unprece-
dented in higher education."

“I believe further,” he wrote “that
a policy which permits such repres-
sive action jeopardizes the academic
freedom of all faculty.“ He said the
only reason he was given for this
action was that he “did not fit in with
the present adminstration of the
medical school.”

Olson said he was assured by both
Detre and Senior Vice-Chancellor
for the Health Sciences Nathan
Stark that he would direct the cen-
ter. On January 24, without prior

Tuition hike

expected for
next year

By Michael Pay
The Pitt News

Pitt’s operating budget for next
year will probably include a tuition
increase of at least five percent, \
according to Senior Vice-
Chancellor For Administration
Jack Freeman.’

This expected increase, he said, is
largely due to the signiﬁcant differ-
ence between the 16.4 percent‘
increase in state funding requested ’
by Pitt and the seven percent
increase proposed by Governor
Thornburgh. ' '

Freeman said the seven percent
increase proposed by the governor
“reﬂects his genuine commitment to
higher education," but the 16.4 per-
cent increase initially requested by

- Pitt reflects the university’s “realistic

needs." The difference will have to
be made up in other areas, he said,
which could lead to higher tuition
for ‘students and lower salary

‘ increase for staff members.

Pitt will have a chance to plead its
case before the appropriations com-
mittees of both houses of the state
legislature. Meetings are scheduled
for Feb. 28 in the state House of
Representatives and March 12 in the
state Senate.

‘According to Ronald Cowell, a
member of the House Appropria-
tions Committee and a Pitt gradu-
ate, no firm decisions will be made in
the meetings. “It is simply an oppor-
tunity for Pitt to explain what they I
do with what they already have," he
said. A ,

Pitt representatives at the meetings

McKeesport water problems caused by parasite

By Catherine Save]
The Pitt News A

Allegheny County Health offi-
cials issued a warning to residents in
the McKeesport and surrounding
communities Wednesday advising
them to boil their water after con-
firming 20 cases of gastrointestinal
disease since December.

Guillermo Cole, information spe-
cialist for the Allegheny County
‘Health Department, explained that
the disease is caused by a giadiasis
cyst, a parasite found in the water
supply.

Dr. Jan. Sykora, a professor of
Industrial and Enivironmental
Health Sciences at Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public Health, said that
the parasitic organism is found in
wildlife such as beavers, skunks and
rodents. When these animals defe-
cate in water, the parasite is left
behind in the fecal matter.

Cole suggested that residents
should boil their water for 10 min-
utes if they are using it for drinking,
cooking and washing raw
vegatables.

“It is not necessary to boil it for
bathing or washing clothes,” said
Cole.

The water problem in McKees-
port is similar to many environmen-
tal hazards that the Pennsylvania
Environmental Resource Founda-
tion (PERF) provides information
on.

The foundation was founded in
January of I981 as an educational

on the matter.

  Wire Talk

Residents of the McKeesport area are still being advised to
boil all water for cooking or drinking purposes for at least I0
minutes. The action is a safeguard against an intestinal ailment
that has affected at least 20 people in the area.

The nuclear corporation that operates the Three Mile Island
nuclear facility said it objects to a list of 63 management
integrity issues that were contained in a Jan. 20 staff memo
made public last week. TMI officials said the memo does not
make clear that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has
resolved all but two of the issues, primarily that the key water
leak records were deliberately falsified at units one and two

In a related matter, former TMI employee William Pensyl is
suing to win back his job at TMI. Pensyl was fired in August
I982 because he continued to wear a_ respirator after his
employer told him it was no longer needed.

The, people of Bristol, Tenn., are toting guns and are remain-
ing alert for two escaped convicts, Ronald Freeman and James
Cleff, who have been on the lam for five days.

Freeman and Cleff, armed with a shotgun and at least four
pistols, have already killed one man and brieﬂy kidnapped his
wife. Police have been granted authority to shoot to kill. Fear is
running high throughout the eastern Tennessee area. State
safety official Billy Jones has urged area residents to stay calm.
“We don’t want to call out the vigilantes,“ said Jones.

clearinghouse and network for
inquiries regarding hazardous waste
management and other environmen-
tal concerns.

A few years ago, authorities and A

PERF staff were alerted to a water
problem similar to the one in
McKeesport. Residents living in the
area between Wilkes-Barre and
Scranton were becoming ill after
drinking the water in those com-
munities. They, too, were suffering
from severe cramps andqgas pains.
The Department of Environmental
Resources was alerted and found
that the water had been contami-
nated by the giadiasis cyst.

People suffering from this partic-
ular illness usually get their water
supply from reservoirs that are
uncovered, even though the water is
chemically treated with chlorine.
Over 295 cases of the giadiasis cyst
have been reported to the Depart-

-ment of Environmental Resources-

in those areas.

Without medication, it takes
about 10 days for the illness to run
its course. Scott Cassel, a PERF
employee who works mainly on the
Hazardous Waste Management
Project, said that the evidence of the
cyst does not show up in water tests.

Sykora, a specialist in water-
borne diseases, explained that chlor-
ination does not help. Sedimenta-
tion and filtration are the best treat-
ments to avoid the occurrance of
parasites like the giadiasis cyst.

Cassel said the foundation,

manned by a full-time staff, provides '

information and access to a state-
wide. speaker‘s bureau, small

\

government seminars, relevant liter-
ature, information requests and reg-
ulations. Its primary office is located
in Philadelphia.

He summed up the primary func-
tion of the foundation as “Opening
up citizens’ minds to the fact that

hazardous waste is a big problem, I

and people need facts to treat
hazardous waste.“ . . .

One way in which the foundation
provides these facts to the general

public is through the recently
created Access Line. The Access
Line is a toll free number (800-322-
92l4) that anyone can call to report
what may be a violation of hazard-
ous waste management in hisvarea.
Cassel said the line receives

, approximately 500 calls per month.

The line can also be used simply to
make inquiries and ask for educa-
tionalmaterial about the speaker‘s
bureau and the vast number of pub-
lications and literature to which the
foundation’s staff has access.

The Environment Protection
Agency and the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental
Resources are the enforcing agencies
the foundation will contact ifa prob-
lem or situation ‘ merits further
investigation. .

“PERF is not a branch of EPA,"
Cassel said. “We try not to antagon-
ize but work and cooperate with
industry and government toregulate
and manage hazardous waste in a
respectable way.” I

One third of PERF’s funding
comes from industry. The other two-
thirds comes from memberships,
foundations, private donations and
government grants.

“Anyone can be a member of
PERF,” said Cassel.

Not all inquiries pertaining to
potential hazards to.Pennsylvanians
are of an industrial nature. Another
area about which PERF supplies
information to the public is the
Superfund National Priorities
Ranking List and Superfund Clean-
up Program.

A Superfund Site has gone
through intense investigation - first
by the Department of Environmen-
tal Resources and then by the EPA.
Tests are run, and samples are taken
ofthe soil, water and air. The area is
finally scored and ranked according
to specific guidelines of the EPA.

There are over 500 Superfund
Sites across the country. As of Sep-

tember 1983, Pennsylvania had 39 of¢

these sites. Cassel said that in April
or May 1984, there will be between
six and 12 sites added to the National
Priorities List.

Superfund, under the authority of
the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Lia-
bilities Act ofl980 (CERCLA), gives
EPA the authority to regulate
hazardous waste and abandoned

waste dumps across the country,

according to Cassel. Funds are allo-
cated for clean-up under Superfund.
' In Allegheny County, there are

two Superfund Sites that are eligible ’

for funding under the Superfund
Clean-up Program. They are the
Resin Disposal Site in Jefferson and
the Lindane Dump in Natrona
Heights, Harrison Township.

The Hercules Company originally
owned the Resin site. The Pennwalt
Corporation was the original owner
of the Lindane Dump. Both com-
panies are cooperating at this time
with EPA in the clean-up process.

Cassel said that if a company does
not cooperate with EPA in the
Superfund program, it can be fined
up to three times the original cost of
the clean-up. '

The Lindane Dump in
Natrona Heights is a community
park with tennis courts and two
baseball fields. It also has 400
tons of powdered Lindane waste
and possibly other industrial
waste, according to an Environ-
mental Protection Agency
report, which qualiﬁes it as a
Superfund site.

The residents refer to this
recreation area as the Natrona
ALSCO Community Park
(NACP). The park was con-
structed in the fall of 1976 after
Harrison Township officials
acquired the land as a donation

from Allegheny Ludlum Steel

Corporation.
Benny Palumbo was the con-

' tractor hired to build the base-
\ball park. He was operating his

bulldozer to do the initial grad-
ing of the area when he noticed
white dust immediately.

After working for about five to
six hours at the site, Palumbo
said he got a headache, felt dizzy
and started to see as though he
was looking through a haze.

Palumbo contacted Harrison
Township officials and
explained the situation. They, in
turn, contacted the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental
Resources.

Daniel Peterson, solid waste
regional operations supervisor
with the department here in
Pittsburgh, is the inspector for
the Lindane Dump site.

Peterson said, “When the
material was first discovered, it
seemed to be a sort of surprise to
everybody. There may have been
people who "knew the area was
used for dumping materials; if
they knew what was dumped
there or not, I really don't
know.’_’ 0

That's the problem with such
substances, according to Dr.
Dietrich Weyel, a professor of
environmental and industrial
health at Pitt‘s Graduate School
of Public Health. He said that
often officials don't know what a

substance is, but they do know»

that what they have is,“some
mean stuff.”

Harrison Township officials
felt the stuff was'“mean" enough
to take immediate action. Both
they and DER officials
instructed Palumbo to cover the
material with 12 inches of slag, a

few more inches of lime and then 7

a few more of topsoil.

“There’s about 16 to 18 inches
of covering material out there,”
Palumbo said.

The original owner, Pennwalt
Corporation, has been cooperat-
ing with the, DER since 1980 in an
investigation and clean-up pro-
gram. Since the investigation
began, Pennwalt has employed
the independent consulting firm
of Associated Water and Air
Resounces Engineering, Inc.,

which has provided studies and
monitorings of the air, water and
soil at the Lindane Dump site.

Victor Musmanno, manager
of state and community relations
at Pennwalt, says that there was
an environmental toxicologist
on staff. “The DER felt it was
appropriate to retain an inde-
pendent toxicologist to keep
things pure and objective,” he
said.

Patrolman John Marino of
the Harrison Township Police
Force lives in a housing develop-
ment which is adjacent to the
park.

But as a Superfund site the
NACP now has a restriction
placed on the deed.

“Deed restriction for Super-
fund sites is standard," Peterson
said. “It's just a notification in
the deed stating there are wastes
buried there. We don’t want
things to pop up later that new
property owners didn’t know
about."

The Selling of America R

It creeps along, worming its way into everyone’s life. It
slithers in and out of the mouths of our politicians.

The Federal deﬁcit. - P -

The presidential candidates banter this term about when

R they attack one another in debates, yet few have acttially

explained what it is, how it affects the U.S. and, most impor-
tantly, how to reduce it. ‘ V

A large U.S. deficit leads to higher interest rates. This is
because the government is forced to borrow more and more
money“ to pay for the services it provides and to pay back the
money it has already borrowed. Therefore, thereare fewer and
fewer dollars for business and individuals to borrow.

Simple supply and demand. Fewer dollars leads to higher
interest rates. This means less money can be spent on moderniz-
ing industries, and consumers can’t make large purchases that
often require loans, i.e., homes and cars. These types of pur-
chases are integral to revitalizing our nation’s economy.

Generally, wealthy and productive nations enjoy a trade
surplus. Theeconomic benefits of this allow them to loan
money, for a profit, to poorer countries. The United States,
however, has slid in the other direction. A $5 billion surplus in
1981 has eroded into the projected $60 billion deficit. This can
be traced to several international occurrances and domestic
Federal policies.

A fiscal crisis in many of the world’s poorer countries, espe-
cially Latin America, has forced them to limit their purchases
of imported goods, which come primarily from the. United
States. At the same time, the economy in the United States is
improving faster than that of the rest of the world, so we are
purchasing foreign products faster than other nations can pur-
chase ours. _ e .

The strength of the U.S. dollar allows companies and
wealthy individuals from other countries to escape the instabil-
ities of their own countries and take advantage of our high
interest rates. By buying in the U.S., foreign investors are
rapidly acquiring vast amounts of land in this country and are
eagerly buying American stocks and bonds. = .

The power of the American dollar makes it harderfor ou
companies to sell in foreign countries and easier for them to sell
in the U.S. T

The government must reduce the attractiveness of the Amer-

‘ ican dollar. We would then be able to correct some of these

trade inadequacies. This, in turn, would improve our economic

recovery in a more stable and lasting fashion rather than/with
the makeshift cures now in use. At first glance, it may sound

counterintuitive to deliberately reduce the value of our dollar, H

but with today's abstract world economy, our recovery is
‘dependent on international recovery. And to do this we must
reduce the deficit.

Room 441/ Adam Eisenstat

Letter; T “The Editor  

Editor fails at
getting facts

We are writing in response to the
“Muscle” article that appeared in the
Wednesday, Feb. 15, 1984, issue of
The Pitt News.

Our first concern is with the state-
ment made by the Nautilus‘Center
manager. He states, “Each machine
is designed to isolate a specific mus-
cle. It’s not like lifting weights or
pumping iron.“ We would like to
know how such a misinformed per-
son became the manager of a health-
oriented institution. Any educated
individual with an interest in weight

training, i.e., use of Nautilus, free
weights or weight machines, is aware

"that isolating a muscle group is

determined by the specific exercise
and how strictly it is performed.
Isolating and working specific
muscle groups can be accomplished
by the use of free weights equally as
well as using Nautilus. In fact, train-
ing with Nautilus is only differen-

tiated from free-weight training by ‘

the cam system, which allows con-
stant resistance throughout the full
range of motion. This cam system,
however, does not isolate the
muscle. ‘ ‘

The manager also states that

“Nautilus machines tone muscles.”
However, he does not seem to be

aware that a properly designed free-
weight training program can facili-
tate muscle toning as well as a
Nautilus program.

Our second concern deals with
how the author alludes to the Trees
Hall facility as if we’re Gold’s Gym
or a European Health Spa. It is, in
fact, a disgrace for a university with

' the size and credibility that Pitt has

to have such an out-of-date and ill-

equipped weight training facility.
For example, there are three weight
benches with supports, but there is
only onestraight bar. The other two
“straight" bars are bent. There are
only a few collars that work for the
free-weight bars and, all too often,
there are machines out of order.

Of course,'it is easy to see why
primitive machines are constantly
faulting. They are as old as the build-
ing in which they are housed. The
picture of the free-weight setup in
the center ofthe article is totally mis-
leading. There are no Olympic-style
weight sets in.Trees Hall.

Our final concern deals with the
general ineptness of the reporter and
the features editor, Joe Zeff, who let
this article appear in the college
paper. This accusation is not
unfounded. The reporter mentions
“a group of students" who use the
Trees Hall facility, but only one per-
son is mentioned and quoted. The
reporter also can’t seem to tell the
difference between news articles and
advertisements, as the nine-
paragraph Body Technics plug illus-
trates. The rest” of the article is
poorly "researched and borders on
lying. We suggest that The Pitt News
research the material in the article
an_d try to write the truth. ‘

The notion that the funds spent on

cabinet as well as the foreign service
with a relentless gang of bigshot cro-
nies whose qualifications are sus-
pect. to say the least.

What does one have to do to be a
Reagan appointee? A lot of money
and heavy corporate interests are
top on thelist. A staunch, ultra-right

ideology is also up there. But more
importantly, it seems that one has to
be a good pal of Reagan’s. There‘s
nothing wrong with that, if you
happen to like the president and his
politics.

Moreover, it is his right as a high-
ranking politician to choose whom
he wants for any post he is permitted
to fill, no matter how corrupt or
inept that individual happens to be.
To the victor go the spoils, as they
say.

' If, on the other hand, you happen
to disagree with Reagan and every-
thing for which he stands, the cro-
nyocracy which he has methodically

assembled during his tenure in office
is like a bad dream. lt’s akin to being
stricken with a debilitating disease in
which you see multiple images ofthe
same marauding monstrosity.
Nothing better illustrates these
all-too-real, reactionary hallucina-
tions than the recent appointment of
Ed Meese to the position of Secre-
tary of_Justice. Meese has been pro-
moted from Reagan’s ultra-'
right-hand man, who merely t_urned
his crank and steered him in the right
direction, to the head of the most
powerful law enforcement agency in
the country. Ed Meese, the man who
wants to stop legal aid to the poor,

thinks progressive income tax is
immoral —- that’s what he said -
and feels compelled to denounce the
annoying pleas of the hungry.

Of course, the man whom Meese
succeeds, William French Smith,
was hardly a bearer of progressive
policy. He worked vigorously to
acquire tax breaks for segregated
private schools. He is also the man

.most responsible for one ofthe most

odious, anti-democratic proposals
for government security, in which
over l00,000 government employees
would be required to sign secrecy
oaths to which they would be bound
for life.

Rightist minions like Meese and
Smith don’t speak well for represen-
tative government; the entire admin-
istration doesn't. But Reagan has an
uncanny knack for sugar-coating
the worst aspects of his administra-
tion and‘ applying patches where
needed, as in the case of James Watt
and the EPA. It's as if he werea huge
bloodworm whose tail gets out off;
he always manages to regenerate an
identical one. A vote for Reagan is
an affirmation of cronyocracy. lt is
also a vote for all of his chums who
adhere to his patronage and policies
like ﬂies to you-know-what.

Pitt student . body underwent
change of life, panelists agree

By Kelly Murray
The Pitt News

Four years ago, Pitt's Office of
Faculty Development sponsored a
seminar on “The Pitt Student.” Yes-
terday, the seminar was repeated
with the conclusion that, in the
words of director Robert Wolke, the
Pitt student of the '80s is “a very
different animal” from the one dis-
cussed at the first seminar.

Former Student Goverment
Board president Mark Downs,
director of admissions and student
aid Dr. Joseph Merante and Dr.
Janice Gibson, a professor in Pitt’s
department of educational psychol-
ogy, presented their views ofthe Pitt
student at the seminar.

Gibson said that “major changes”
are occurring in the makeup of the
student body. Seventeen percent of
the academic population is now
comprised of “non-traditional” stu-
dents —— older students, interna-
tional students and minority
students from the Pittsburgh area. »

She said that the university is
meeting the needs of this group by
offering night classes, non-degree
adult education, and programs
aimed at those students primarily
interested in the learning experience

Pitt provost predict

,?

‘Students come into the university saying.
‘This is’what I am going to study, this is what

I am going to do.’

——Janice Gibson

at a university.

Along with the ' changes in
makeup, Gibson said that she senses
a change in attitude among Pitt stu-
dents. “Students come into the uni-
versity saying, ‘This is what I am
going to study, this is what I am
going to do,’ ” she said.

Downs said that the primary
interest of today’s Pitt student are
materialistic in nature. He added
that students today are seeking qual-
ities useful in thejob market, such as
leadership skills.

“We are very practical,” Downs
said, “in the sense in that we realize
that opportunities just aren’t going
to come knocking, we must create
them.”

According to Downs, students
“have their goals set; they know
where they want to go in life, and are
setting their directions right away.

They are coming out of the starting
gate, full speed ahead.”

Merante presented a profile ofthe
present Pitt freshmen. According to
Merante’s composite, 85 percent
ranked in the upper two-fifths of
their high school class, averaging 21
3.34 G.P.A. According to a survey
by the Ofﬁce of Admissions, the
average freshman Q.P.A. is 2.46 for
men, and a somewhat better 2.75 for
women. ‘

SAT scores for Pitt freshmen
averaged 470 verbal, 520 math. SAT
scores for minority students aver-
aged 100 points lower than non-
minority students. These statistics

would not be used in official univer- _

sity publications, said Merante,
because in most instances, “special
access students or borderline stu-
dents” [scores] are eliminated from
"the profile, so that it looks better
than it is.”

:s changes in

departmental sizes, resources

By Bernadette Hartman
The Pitt News

Pitt provost Roger Benjamin said
that some of the university’s depart-
ments “will have to grow smaller,
but some will grow" during a meet-
ing ofthe Faculty of Arts and Scien-
ces Council yesterday. 0

In addressing the reallocation of
university resources, Benjamin said
that each department will provide
him with a listing of its programs,
ranked by priority.

Benjamin said that the realloca-
tion of university resources is not

intended to “set up everyone as a
series of ducks and pull the trigger."

He said that his only goal is to
increase the quality of education at
Pitt.

Benjamin said that the work by
each department will begin in
March, with their findings to be
presented to the Provost’s Office
over the summer. Discussion
between the various departments
and the provost will continue
throughthe fall, with the ﬁnal report
going to the Chancellor's Office in
January, I985. .

The provost said that while some
of Pitt's departments are weak, oth-
ers are of international stature. He

said that other universities across
the country have undergone similiar
reorganization, citing the University
of California at Berkeley, the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin and MIT as
examples.

_ Benjamin said that staff coopera-
tion will be the key to the plan’s
success.

Professor Kevin Sontheimer of
Pitt‘s economics department
reported on the work of an ad hoc
committee that advised Dean
Rosenberg in Fiscal Year 1983 in the
development of a five-year plan for
reducing the size of the faculty in
FAS. Sontheimer said that the origi-
nal plan for reducing faculty by 53
was not acceptable.

least the seven percent increase pro-
posed by Thornburgh. He added
that the meetings_ are “an opportun-

foot forward.”

Cowell said he favors any
increases in funding for higher edu-
cation. He added that “the mood in
the House is supportive" and pre-
dicted that the governor’s proposed
increase will easily be passed.

Pitt representatives at the meet-
ings in Harrisburg will include
Chancellor Wesley Posvar, Assist-
ant Vice-Chancellor and director of
commonwealth relations Thomas
Lamb, Freeman, and faculty and
student leaders.

Freeman said he is very optimistic
that Pitt will receive the seven per-
cent increase, but as to whether it
could be even higher, he said, “Your
guess is as good as mine."

Change in W. Germany

New party rocks status quo

By Bob Steen
The Pitt News

The Greens, a new political party,
are changing the face of politics in
West Germany, according to a polit-
ical science professor from the Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley,
who spoke before the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs (GSPIA) on Wednesday.

“Observers say that the atmos-
phere in Parliament will never be the
same,” Christine Schaefer said. “The
Greens have succeeded in making
politics more transparent [by intro-
ducing] a climate of fear into com-
mittees.” She believes that the
members are less able to keep
secrets. '

The Greens have campaigned on
environmental issues and opposi-
tion to the stationing of U.S. nuclear
missiles in Western Europe and as a

result, won six percent of the Ger- K

man vote in last spring’s election.
This gave them 27,seats in the Ger-
man Parliament.

Schaefer believes that despite crit- ~

icism and splits in the party,‘ the
appearance of a social movement
and new acceptance of the party by
the press will contribute to its con-

tinued existence.

Schaefer also said that the rejec-
tion of political conventions by the
Greens in Parliament, symbolized
by their casual dress and their riding
bicycles to. the Bundestag, “has

, introduced a whole new tone into

politics." V

Taking the elitism out of politics
“is a tiny step toward closing the gap
between politicians and the people
outside," she said.

Some critics think that the Greens
will fail to hold together as a party
now that the media's attention to
arms -deployment and demonstra-
tions has subsided. But Schaefer

- said she does not think the party will

fade so easily. ~
The social movement which gives
the Green party its strength is not
dying in her view. “The peace move-
ment isn't going to go away,“ she
said, nor will the issue of ecology.
She cited the visibility of acid
rain’s effect on one third of Ger-
many's forests as an issue which will
continue to "draw support for the

party. The Greens‘ proposals forjob

sharing and a 35-hour workweek

A will draw more support from labor,

she said. ’ . .
As for the media, Schaefer said
“the liberal [German] press certainly

demise," Schaefer said.

GSPIA professor Beverly Craw-
ford, who introduced the speaker,
said she agrees that, as a social
movement, the Greens will continue
to be strong. “But whether they will
be crucial to social movements as a
party, that’s up for grabs,” she said.

“I would venture to say that they
don’t have a solid future,” said Bert
Rockman, professor of political
science at Pitt. Such leftist parties
te-nd to break up because ofinternal
disruption and failure to diversify,
he explained.

Rockman said he thought
Schaefer stereotyped the policies of
the present German government. He
said all parties —— notjust the Greens
— have emphasized “Ostpolitik,”
the reconciliation of tensions
between the East and West
Germany.

“There was a certain amount of
tension between‘ the group that
thought the dean was doing a good
job and the one that thought he
wasn’t." .

Norman, who recorded the min-
utes of Friday’s meeting, refused to
reveal which side he was on. In the
meetings record, though, he did

‘ “note the irony that a school of

government was having difficulty
governing itself."

The meeting ended with an
amendment calling for three future
meetings to be held to determine the
feasibility of the senate’s proposal.
Before the group adjourned, Profes-
sor Donald Goldstein was recorded
as saying, “It [isn’t] advisable to

Dean’s departure a surprise

mined what courses are taught?
Who is on the inside‘?’’ \

It is this uncertainty that Norman
said led to Funari‘s resignation.

“The dean had a problem. The
dean left," said Norman, a GSPIA
faculty member for l7 years. “Peo-
ple lost confidence in him. He had 10
years to prove his leadership ability,
and he failed.

“There was no leadership ability
on his part. Certain managerial
skills he did well. I think he was
orderly and gave a sense of getting
things done on time.

“But he had no sense in what
direction the school was headed,”
Norman added. “I really think he
had no clear direction of where the
school was going."

Though Haley, who noted that he
was unaware of any‘ political in-
fighting, seemed disconcerted over
Funari’s leaving, he refused to dis-
close the reasons Funari gave for his
decision.

“It was very unfortunate,” Haley
said. “He was my boss. I had respect
for his ability and leadership. There
were personal reasons over his
resigning, though I don’t want to
convey why he resigned."

Studio Theatre Production War

By[HNALARDAS

The latest Pitt Studio Theatre.pro-
duction is David Rimmer’s‘ Album,
Qiirected by Peter Harrigan, which
takes a look at the lives of four high
school students growing up during
the '60s. The play's dialogue over-
flows with references to the Beach
Boys, Beatles, Stones and Dylan, and
the production reinforces the influ-
ences of music on the characters by
using songs and slide projections of
the decade's popular singers.

The play opens with Billy and Boo
stripped down to their underwear,

gwhile Peggy and Trish remain fully

clothed after a few rounds of strip
poker. When the action gets too
heavy, Trish backs out of the game.
The rest of the play shows the four
friends dealing with their sexuality
and the fear and excitement of grow-
ing up. The culmination comes on the
night before the girls’ graduation;
ﬁilly and Peggy are at the quarry, and
Trish and Boo are at the Paradise
Motel. .
Though an enjoyable enough

show, especially for anyone who suf-

fered growing pains in that decade,
the production was plagued witl'i‘sev-
eral problems, many of them techni-
cal‘. Lights were raised before actors
had made proper exits. The set pieces,
which were rearranged by the actors

etween scenes, were effective but
were set up in a way that confined the
performers. They had limited space
to work in, and consequently, their

 

actions were stifled at times.

Kimberly Verruggio was believable
as Peggy, the more outgoing and
experienced of the two girls. Cynie
Cory had a tougher job to tackle as
Trish. She was fine in the first act, as
when she explained to Peggy that she
was ”weird” because she dreamt only
of kissing the Beach Boys’ Brian Wil-
son, but she didn't quite pull it off
when she later ran away with Boo.

Part of the problem lies in the
script. We're told that the reason
Trish leaves home is that her mother
waits up for her when she comes
home late. If that were the case, every
child in the world would be on the
missing persons list. Also, the actors’
motivations were not always clear;
therefore, the audience was left ques-
tioning several of their actions. This
problem arose when Billy smashed
'Boo’s Dylan album to pieces. If_he
hated listening to Boo’s incessant
ramblings about Dylan's music, why
didn't he just leave the room? Direc-
tor Peter Harrigan could have done a
better job in helping the actors to jus-
tify their actions.

Sean Chiani played Boo in the first
act with the right amount of naivete.
However, in the second act when his
character donned sunglasses and a
jean jacket to imitate his hero, the
innocence was still there, and it just
wasn't believable. Michael Koegel did
a good job as Billy, the boy who hid
behind the tough exterior. His final
scenes with Verruggio, when the two
finally admitted that they needed

each other, really flew.

The ending came as no surprise.
Anyone who's suffered through pub-
erty knows that it can be survived.
The question that remains is: What
became of the two couples? Did the
relationships continue, or were they
just passing phases in the steps

toward adulthood? Album fails to
leave the audience with any definite
answers, a fault that lies not solely in
the production but in the script as
well. .\
Album continues through this
weekend at the Studio Theatre.

Starring in the New City Theatre's production of Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong are (l-r): Ieff Howell, LeLand Gant, Norrice

Rgymaker and Lynn Pasteris.

In its first production outside of

wright creates characters for the
stage. The difference is that because
he sings many of his own songs, peo-
ple misunderstand and think that he
is advocating the extinction of short
people, the power of rednecks or
dropping a nuclear bomb, when, in
fact, he is trying to point out how low
love and charity are on the list of
motives for human behavior.”
Whether you agree or not, Maybe is
musical entertainment that satirizes

American history, the South, com-
merce, love, wealth, priorities, a”pin-
head's view of China,” success,
foreign policy, sex, entertainment,
creativity, escape and — of all places
— Ohio. ‘

The method to this madness is a

‘five—piece band led by_Russ Walker
and a four-member ensemble of-

actor/singer/dancers featuring Lynn
Pasteris, Norrice Raymaker, LeLand
Cant and Jeff Howell.'All veterans of
local stage, the ensemble is even and
well-matched in presenting the
music, directed by Ken Gargaro, and
choreography of Melanie Smith. The
ensemble was framed by a. red on
black. foot-lighted cabaret set and
monikered portal designed by Tony
Ferrieri. «

The bi—level set was further
dressed (as were the actors) with the
appearance of costumes by Sharon
Sobel. Sparse but suggestive, Sobel's
additions of thing such as white
gloves, farthingales, straw hats and
yoke to the basic black costume of the

ensemble made transitions between

numbers smooth and complete.
Credit for this productison is not

complete without further mention of

Ied Harris. If one of a director's func-
fions is to make a comment to the
audience, Harris did so — usually in a
political manner — the most heavy-
handed example being a caricature of
(No, Virginia, that was not Howdy
Doody.)" Ronald Reagan in the final
number ”Mr. President (Have Pity
On The Working Man).”

Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong, the third
show in the New City Theatre's 10th
anniversary season, runs through
March 11, and if you want tickets, it's
advisable to contact the box office
(624-4101) early, as the evening per-

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

During the past year or so, movie
screens have flashed teen-age saga
after teen—age saga in what seems like
an endless attempt to dissect and
define the problems of youth. Lighter
approaches like Valley Girl, Porlcysl 61
II, Risky Business, and even the older,
but immortal Rock and Roll High School
were silly but overall more successful
than "serious" attempts like All The
Right Moves or the recent Reckless. Hol-
lywood doesn't seem to understand
teenagers, and thus we keepseeing
these halfhearted attempts at com-
bining the youthful elements of pop
culture '— rock music — with ‘a
serious subject or situation. But at
least half of these movies dissolve
into little more than sex-ploitation
flicks midway through running time,
probably to ensure box—office
returns. What we end up with is an
entire genre of its own (the teen film)
but not one single picture that can
adequately define that genre.

 Footloose is the newest addition to

this group, and, although much bet-
ter than the majority of its cinematic
peers, it, too, fails in its bid to present
abelievable depiction of the lives of
teenagers.‘ T

Ren (Kevin Bacon of Diner fame), a
punkish-looking sophisticate from
Chicago, is forced to move to a small
midwestern town called Bomont
with his mother and live with rela-
tives because his father has aban-
doned them and left them in financial
shambles. And this is where the trou-
bles — both within the story itself
and from the_audience’s point of view
‘— begin. «

Bomont is as strait-laced as they

come. No one swears, no one drinks,’

everyone attends church, groups of
concerned citizens regularly burn
books considered "unsuitable" read-
ing material and — the biggest con-
cern in Footloose — dancing is
forbidden. Bomont gives new mean-

iootloose’

Tripped Up V

Lori’Singer and Kevin Bacon from Footloose.

Ren has a rather ‘difficult time

fiscate his music. tapes, students
threaten him with physical violence,
and parents blame him for every-
thing bad that happens in the town.
Again, unbelievable since we never
see Ren do anything to deserve such
unwarranted abuse. Sure, he's an
outsider, but that's no reason for all
these people to take out their aggres-
sions on him.

Ren decides to become a crusader. ‘

of sorts for the youth of Bomont, and
his first effort is to repeal the no
dancing law thatwent into effect a
few years back when a bunch of tee-
nagers, including the preacher's son,
wrecked after attending a dance and
died. Of course, the citizens of
Bomont don't take kindly to this
stranger's trying to civilize their Bible
Belt town, so there are more threats
and physical violence, but after Ren
quotes the good book a few times,
people decide that maybe he is okay
after all, and everything becomes
hunky-dory.

Footloose may have a dumb story
line, but it does have two important
things going for it: a solid cast and
energetic dance numbers. Kevin
Bacon is appealing in the lead role,
but one gets the definite impression
that he's cut out for better things, as
is the rest of the cast —]ohn Lithgow
(nominated for an Academy Award
this year for his role in Terms ofEndear—
merit) as the preacher who comes to
realize that he can't dictate people's
lives, Lori Singer as the preacher's
wild-spirited daughter who despises
her father's rules and regulations and
especially Christopher Penn (Sean's
younger brother), who infuses his
small part as the dumb-witted tough
guy with a flame of originality. The
dance numbers —- and there's really
only three of them — are fun and

exuberant but not. as showy as those .

in other films like Fame or Flashdance.

Footloose is by no means a waste; it's
far too entertaining and made too

ing to the word "conservative."
Sound a bit overdone? It is. If the
screenwriter, Doan Pitchford, had

qualities to Bomont, it may have been
believable; however, as it stands, the
fictitious Bomont remains just that

well to throw it into that category.
But don't go expecting to see a movie , «

By RICHARD SATER

Bill Miner, nicknamed "The Gen-
tleman Bandit" and credited with
originating the "Hands up!" com-
mand, spends 33 years at San Quen-
tin for armed robbery. Parole arrives
in. 1901, a new century and an
entirely different world. No longer is
the country loosely connected with
stage lines. Railroad tracks join one
end to the other, and Miner finds
himself lacking a job. "I rob stage-
coaches," he says apologetically, but
there are none.

The Great Train Robbery, a 1903
motion picture that shows how to
commit that crime sparks his interest
in newer transportation; Miner suc-
cessfully adapts his profession to the

‘modern times. In a small Canadian

town, sitting out an intensive police
search, Bill meets Kate Flynn, a spins-
ter photographer. And they find

’ themselves in love.

This slim, factual permise lends
itself to The Grey Fox, a Canadian pic-
ture ranking with the best films

noteworthy for matchless treatment

of its subject. ,

As Bill Miner, Richard Farnsworth
earns the largest share of credit. He
connects all the dots that make the
bandit charming and admirable des-
pite the singular disregard for the

law. Farnsworth's heroically lined.
1 face and pale blue eyes merge with his

brush mustache and shy grin for an
undefinable, dignified appeal which
reflects — quite simply —— Bill Miner,
at once the past, present and future
of a man.

Farnsworth had been a stuntman
in Hollywood since 1937. ' Only
recently has he turned to acting, but
he's as comfortable in the role as the
old plainsman hat that Miner wears
constantly. Jackie Burroughs
partners him as Kate Flynn, angular
and independent and vulnerable —— a
Katharine Hepburn role and played

' as such. Bill sings "Sweet Betsy from

Pike" during a bath as a montage deli-
cately presents tableaux of their
growing affection.

His moments stand out - the visit
to the cinema which re-ignites his
career, the first botched train
robbery, oranges shared with a small
boy, a picnic with Kate set casually
against the Rocky Mountains.

not particularly intelligent Shorty,

Timothy Webber as the Canadian
Mountie reluctant to apprehend the
bandit and others contribute solid
performances. Phillip Borsos directed
neatly and unobtrusively; the on-
location scenery in British Columbia
and Washington‘ state, naturally, is
breathtaking. And an epilogue with a
satisfactory twist ends the film.

The Grey Fox stands as a fitting trib-
ute to the romance which remains
the biggest part of the Old West.

‘Lassiter’

Tom Selleck, who's a fairly good
looking fellow, and athletic, and has a
mustache, makes another bid for the
still—open Movie Idol spot with his
latest. Like 1983's High Road to China,
this year's model — Lassiter, named for
the Selleck character ~ is a period
piece, set in the London of 1939, prior
to British involvement in the Second
World War.

Lassiter, an American professional
thief waiting in England for some sta-
tutes of limitations to run out, finds
himself in an awkward position: Scot-
land Yard asks a favor in exchange for
which Lassiter will not get two
decades in the slammer on trumped-
up charges. The German embassy
will shortly receive $10 million in
uncut diamonds (stolen from Cze-
choslovakia). An agent will smuggle
them out of the country, sell them
and use the money to finance Nazi
operations in South America and
Europe. ‘

The Yard asks Lassiter to steal the
diamonds to prevent the spreading of

German power. Caught between an
annoying rock and an equally ‘annoy-
ing hard place, Lassiter agrees; his
options are jail, possible death or,
least likely, success. To get at the jew-
els, he forces a relationship with the
not-too—bad looking German courier
who will be in charge of the gems —
Kari von Fursten. She, a sadist played
by Lauren Hutton, presents an obsta-
cle for Lassiter, who's already emo-
tionally involved with Sara Wells
(Jane Seymour), a chorus dancer who
doesn't believe his excuses for the lip-
stick all over his shirt front. She
leaves him, but not for long.

More stereotypes: Lassiter has a
sidekick, naturally, named Smoke (Ed
Lauter), a Jack-of—all—trades, most of
them car theft, who extricates his pal
from a number of scrapes. Joe Regal-
buto plays an ineffectual but likeable
FBI agent named Breeze who has no
good reasons for being in London,
but he works with the genuinely
nasty Yard detective, Becker (Bob
Hoskins, chewing the scenery).

Lassiter collected an "R" rating. Sev-
eral people get murdered. Lassiter
says "bullshit" once. There's gratui-
tous nudity (Hutton and Seymour
from the front and Selleck from the
back) to satisfy both sexes and a fair
number of admittedly erotic encoun-
ters. The raw materials of the plot
aren't exactly new: Lassiter borrows
from most of the Nazilheistlactionl
espionage/police films that came out
in the '40s. Character development is

minimal; of course, the fact that the‘

hero will extricate himself by the last
reel is a foregone conclusion, but the
fun is getting to it. There's no theme:
"Someone else dealt the cards. I'm
just playing them out," Lassiter says
(unless that's it).

The mix manages to generate some
suspense, particularly as it railroads
to the conclusion -—— Lassiter, atop the

German embassy building, dodging
bullets from” Nazi machine guns.
Roger Young directed, doing well
enough by the material.

What does that leave? Two things,
Tom and Selleck. He gets through it
entirely on his considerable charm.
He has enough to render Lassiter
enjoyable on a B-movie level. "Sincer-
ity" best summarizes Selleck's acting
style. He's trying. It's not difficult to
assess the box-office appeal of this

Playhouse 6: Point Park‘
Open New Company

By LISA LaVALLE

The newest collaboration of the
Pittsburgh‘ Playhouse Theatre Cen-

ter and Point Park College is a novel »

theater company called The Pitts-
burgh Journeymen. In addition to
serving as the core company for the
successful Playhouse Iunior Theatre,
the new company has developed an
educational program, Tales and Fables,
to tour elementary schools through-
out the tri-state area. This new ven-
ture is unique in that the company
has incorporated the concept of
audience participation. This allows
the student to gain a deeper under-
standing and appreciation of theater
as a living art.

' "The entire show is a lesson in
itself," said Bill Mott. Mott, a member
of the company, is a graduate of Point
Park College and has teaching expe-
rience in children's workshops. Robin
Walsh, another Point Park graduate
and company member, addedthat the
success of the program is due to its
ability to reach the children. "In many
elementary schools, lecturing is the
only form of teaching," said Walsh,
"leaving alternative methods
unexplored."

The company's principles of learn-
ing seem to be working and catching
fire. One would hope that the schools
realize the Journeymen are trying to
do ”everything and anything" in an
attempt to expose children to the

theater. Aside from their involve-
ment in front of and behind the
scenes of their program, they con-
duct a variety of workshops. ”We
have been receiving a couple of
inquiries a day —— some from as far
away as West Virginia and Ohio,"
said Mott.

An additional factor in the success
of the lourneymen is the company
itself. Program Director John Amplas
is a member of the faculty at Point
Park and is an accomplished actor on
both stage and screen. Amplas has
appeared in several George Romero
films, including Knightriders and Creep-
show. His stage credits include major
roles in the Playhouse's Professional
Theatre productions of Ameritan Buf-
falo and The Little Foxes. I

The author of Tales and Fables is F.].
Hartland, a recent graduate of
Carnegie’-Mellon University. Hart-
land was twice the recipient of the
Bud Yorkin Playwright Award and
received top honors in the Double
Image Festival in 1983. His current
piece, A Piano Player with Sad Brown Eyes,
is scheduled to be showcased in Feb-
ruary at Lincoln Center in New York.

In addition to Tales and Fables, the
Iourneymen will be conducting high
school workshops, which will be
fashioned in a more technical manner
than their current workshops. The
new project, Mott said, will be a shor-
tened version of Shakespeare's A
Midsummer Night's Dream.

Pronounce ”Depeche" to

themselves Depeche Mode
forge somemqre identity with

‘their latest lp, Construction Time

Certainly one of the better
all-synthesizer bands, Depeche
Mode remains a somewhat sin-
gular anomaly, for better, and
worse. Expert manipulation of

Richard Mazda
I.R.S.

-Richard Mazda, like Mitch

Easter, is another one of those ,

whiz—kid producers’ who
believes that, after producing
bands like the Fleshtones, Wall
of Voodoo and the Tom Robin-
son Band, he could do just as
well if he made his own album.
Unlike 'M.itch Easter,‘ he's
wrong.

He calls his music ”amphe—
tamine soul,” which is an apt

' description of the wiry, over-

charged music that’s found on
Hands Of Fate — music that's
driven by a domineering bass-
line, African percussion and a
horn sound that is even more
schizophrenic than that found
on Bowie’s extended version of
"Let's Dance.”

_ Yet, for all of its energetic ele-
ments, this album comes off as a
jittery drone, largely because
Mazda ‘employs the same
instrumental arrangement over
and over again. The same bass,
the same horns and the same
percussion are found, in some
way, on every song. Then,
maybe for excitement’s sake, he
throws in a little synthesizer

Gore possesses good pop sense
and an ear for the hook ——
decided advantages.

The other side of the coin:
listen closer. The weariness
implied by the album title surfa-
ces not so much in the music

itself but in the lyrics. ”I’ve a‘

tendency/To be unhappy," Gore
admits in ”Love, In Itself." And
Depeche Mode’s concern for
society — blatant but misdi-
rected-'— reveals itself in deri-
sively simple rhyme and shallow
metaphors, out of. place within
the strict confines of a three-to-
five minute song. ”More Than a

some such disaster in no
stronger terms than ”This isn't

A solution to England's eco-

"nomic problems, offered in

”Pipeline," involves "Taking

that the end result is like coming
down off bad speed.

Throw in Mazda's whiney
vocals, which sound like they
were done by a valley boy with a
nasal infection, and you've got
an album that will ward off
vampires, werewolves and even
David Thomas.

The only salvageable tracks
are "The Crack For '84” and
”]ohannesburg," an old Gil

that he should stick to what he

'tish delivery adds no conviction

to the words, but it sounds
appropriate. The lyrics are
printed on the inner sleeve with
the key passages in italics. Hard
to be more subtle than that.
The songs, though, remain
sturdily engaging on the whole.
”Pipeline" builds from under-

hammering and riveting to hold

it together. ”Told You So"

works as slick and obnoxious
anti-war bop. And Gore has put

Love, and Philly's latest favorite j

son, Robert Hazard, offers no

clues as to their whereabouts on

his latest lp, Wing of Fire.

Creator of a quirky metaphor
with last year's ”Escalator of
Life," from the Robert Hazard ep,
Hazard stumbles miserably on
his first full—length solo album.
Although things start out well
.enough with the record's open-
ing track — ”Hard Hearted"
conjures up images of Graham
Parker —— the musical decline
from there is precipitous and
overwhelming.

A After ”Hard Hearted,"
Hazard embarks on a musical
journey that stretches the limits
of patience; Echoing vocals,
sparse guitar and an off-beat
drum rhythm combine to give
Wing of Fire a spatial sound that
makes one appreciate the artis-
tic achievement in a song like
”Every Breath You Take."

The formula Hazard attempts
is more than mishandled, how-
ever. It's tedious as well. By the
time side two of the record rolls
around, two songs ("If We Can't
Make It" and "Melt Down"),
which might stand out else-
where, are already drowned in a
sea of monotony and repetition.

While songwriting ability is
not necessarily a high priority
for a great bar band, where
image and performance can
overcome the lack of a solid riff,
Hazard has consciously ' put
those days behind him. Judging
by Wing of Fire, he may do well to
reconsider.

Midnight Oil
Columbia

At home, the release of
10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,.2,1 entrenched
Down Unders' Midnight Oil in
the Australian Top 20 for over a
year. Now available in the Uni-
ted States, 1o,9,8..j proves that
all the talk of fire and brimstone
rock was anything but long-
distance hype.

Formed around Sydney in
1978, Midnight Oil has

no

together a minor masterpiece
with "Everything Counts," a
diatribe versus the corporate
power structure but a delicious
pop confection, hypnotic with
its ”Everything counts in large
amounts" chorus and arrange-
ment.»

Construction Time Again indi-
cates expansion. Depeche Mode
remains entertaining even with
the men at work. Don't think
twice; dance.

RICAI-IARD SATER

remained satisfied thus far play-

ing to their cult‘ following of
local surfers and a handful of
Aussie punks. That, however,
may soon be a thing of the past.

Once riveted to the Oil's
sound by the commanding pres-
ence of 6-5 lead singer Peter
Garrett, the band rarely loosens
its grip. From the agitated alie-
nation of the album's opening
track, ”Outside World,"/to the
anthemic ”Power and the Pas-
sion,” through the final warn-
ing of ”Somebody’s Trying to
Tell Me Something," Midnight
Oil keeps you on the edge of
your seat.

Using the unlikely combina-
tion of acoustic rock and vintage
punk (check out "Only the
Strong," ‘F in particular), Mid-
night Oil keeps the listener off-
balance not only musically, but
with lyrical passages that
demand attention as well. At
the climax of the album's most
explosive song, ”Power and the
Passion," a pleading Garrett
cries out: ”It's better to die on
your feet than to live on your
knees." "Short Memory" and
"Read About It" are two more
songs that captivate with a chil-
ling desperation. ‘

All this, of course, is not to
suggest that 10,9,8... is not
without its deficiencies. ”US
Forces," which opens side two,
seems forced to the point where
criticism of American ”bombs
and threats" is muted. Else-
where on the album, the Oil
occasionally overdramatize, but
all in the name of geopolitical
awareness, no doubt.

If you don't like to mix your
politics with music, by all means
steer clear of 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,
2,]. While the musical perfor-
mances on this record merit lis-
tening by anyone, the Oil's
politics are by far the albums’
most prominent ingredient. But
for those who refused to flinch
at the sound of the Clash's two-
minute raging epic, ”White
Riot," prepare yourself again.
Midnight Oil has arrived. ~

Panths slp y tn Hall

Pitt loses
big lead,
hangs on

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

The Panther basketball team may
have learned a valuable lesson in
defeating Seton Hall 71-62 Wednes-
day night at Fitzgerald Field House.
Nobody ever gives up.

After taking an 18-point lead with
less than a minute gone in the second
half, the Panthers fell asleep. The
crowd couldn’t fall asleep because
they never woke up. The few stu-
dents who went to the game must
ﬁve had their minds on biology and
not basketball. V I

And why not? Seton Hall, with
only one Big East win all season,
didn’t seem to be much of a threat.
The Panther squad had won three of
its last four games, with winsover
Villanova and Notre Dame and a
narrow three-point loss to St.
John’s. Surely the Pirates would be
forced to walk the plank.

Not only did the Pirates seem
gady to collect their 17th loss of the
I eason, they looked willing. In the

first half, Seton Hall gave the ball
away I3 times, while the Panthers
took it away from them four more
times. Seton Hall went to the locker
room at halftime in their very famil-
iar position of being behind.

Unfortunately for the Panthers,
the Pirates didn't pack their bags at

\halftime. Content just to cruise to
victory, Pitt sat back and took it
easy. Too easy.

The I8-point spread slowly disap-

peared. With just under 10 minutes .

lt’s a new season for the Pitt wres-
tling team. The 5-12 dual meet
record can be forgotten; this is the
‘time of year where a disappointing
campaign can take a change for the
better.

Starting this afternoon and run-‘

ning through tomorrow night, the
Panthers will be participating in the
ninth annual Eastern Wrestling
League Tournament at Millersville
University.

ment does to a squad.

. Tim Moers/ The Pitt News
ketball coach Jim

Boeheim will play host to the Panthers tomorrow in a Big East battle at the

Carrier Dome.

“To me, it’s much more important
than the dual meet season, even
though the dual meet season can be
an indicator of how well you’ll do
he said. “People don’t
remember the dual meet results; they
remember the end of the year.”

Despite their 1-6 record in league
competition, Stottlemyer believes
Pitt is ready to perform well in the
tournament.

“The team is prepared for the
tournament," he said. “We wrestled
much better at the end than we did in
the beginning. ,

A “I think we‘re peaking now. If
you’re going to peak, there isn’t a
better time for it."

Unlike the dual meet season, tour-
naments are geared for individual

accomplishment rather than team
goals. ‘

“When you get to t e tourna-
ments, it’s the individuals that carry
you," Stottlemyer said. “And I think
we have some individuals who can
do the job.“

Jeff Jelic is one Panther who has
proven in the past he can produce, as
his I983 I58-lb. Eastern Wrestling
League title shows. Althoughghe has
gone up one weight class this season,

the Pitt senior is undefeated in

league competition, 25-2 overall.
Jelic should receive the top tourna-
ment seed at I67.

Other Panther wrestlers who
could also receive a seeding are Kyle
Nellis at I26, John Hnath at 134, Joe

3301] R

Throckmorton at 142 and Joe Bond
at 158.

“Seeds could play a big nart. esDe-
cially' for Bond, Hnath and Throck-
morton," Stottlemyer said. “The
right draw could help them through
the tournament."

A good performance in a league
championship could also help an
individual through a difficult sea-
son. Such could happen with red-
shirt freshman Jack Uppling, who
has been plagued with knee prob-
lems this season while compiling a
5-I0-3 record. Uppling, who holds
Pennsylvania state records in season
and career wins, could perform well
in the tournament.

Panthers
next prey

 By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitthlews

 

For the past few basketball sea-
sons at Seton Hall, the month of
February has proven to be a lost
cause. ’ .

The Panthers took full advantage
of the February ineptitude as they
easily defeated the Pirates 71-62 and
prepped for a showdown Saturday
night at the Carrier Dome in
Syracuse.

‘ In what may have been the most
boring second half of basketball this
season, Pitt stayed awake long
enough to avoid embarrassment.

There were positive signs, how-
ever, for the Panthers, who won the
fourth of their last five contests and

the third of their last four Big East...

matchups;

Senior Clyde Vaughan scored 18
points and pulled ‘down seven
rebounds to break his scoring
slump. Junior Chip Watkins was at
his offensive best with 17 points and
nine rebounds while Pitt shot over
50 percent from the field.

“This might have been my best
performance since I’ve been at Pitt,"
Watkins said. “I play a role on this
team as a rebounder and defensive
player but I was on tonight. In high
school I was a great scorer but I have
a different role on this team."

Pitt held leads of 13 or more for
the final 7:19 of the first half and
carried a 14 point advantage to the
second session.

With 10:40 left in/the game, Seton
Hall‘s Marvin Morris connected on
a three point play to cut the deficit to
seven, 52-45.

Time was running out, but the
Pirates made it interesting trailing
by only five with I225 remaining and
possessing the ball. The interest was
short-lived after a turnover and a

, subsequent foul on Pitt's Matt Mik-

lasevich who converted both ends of
a one-and-one foul shot situation.
The big question that one leaves
Wednesday night's performance
with is whether this same Panther
team can compete with the Orange-
men of Syracuse in front of their

30,000 plus.

“We didn't play well here when we
played them," Pitt coach Roy Chip-
man said. “I think it's very impor-
tant “to get off to a great start,
whether it be offensively or defen-
sively. We don't want to have to
play catch-up up here.”

In Pitt’s Jan. 25 meeting at Fitz-
gerald with the Orangemen, Syra-
cuse out-rebounded and outshot the
Panthers on their way to a 62-58
victory.

The Lady Panther basketball

— team had a six-game home winning
_streak snapped by Cleveland State
gednesday night at Fitzgerald Field

ouse, 78-66.

The loss is the team‘s third defeat
in its past four games. In addition, it
marks the first time Cleveland has
beaten Pitt in five tries. The Lady
Vikings raised their record to 18-7,
while Pitt’s fell to 14-1 1.

“I think Pitt’s a great team,”
Cleveland coach Alice Kohl said.
“They’ve taken us for a long time,
but we’ve been winning all year. We
don’t have one or two outstanding
players, but we play team basketball
on defense and offense."

‘ Pitt was one of only six teams to

efeat the Vikings last season, when
the ladies from Cleveland accrued 23
victories. The Lady Panthers, who
are ll-5 at home, had not lost at
friendly Fitzgerald since December

With one regular season contest
remaining, the hoopers seem to have
run out of gas, or whatever it is that
makes them move. At times during

age year, the team has appeared
unstoppable, but recently, they have
displayed a remarkable lack of con-
sistency. Going through the motions
does not win games.

The Lady Panthers scored first
and led throughout much ofthe first

’ half, at one point leading by eight.

At halftime, however, Cleveland led
31-27.

Turnovers and poor middle-range
shooting once again plagued Pitts-
burgh. The Lady Panthers topped

at unenviable category, turnovers,
losing the ball 30 times compared to
the Lady Vikings’ 14.

With under three minutes remain- _

ing, Cleveland held a slim lead.
Instead of keeping it close, however,
the home team failed to score and
committed too many personal fouls,
enabling the Vikings to score 22
points on foul shots.
Cleveland point guard Sue
Koziol, who scored 15 points and
dished out seven assists, was able to
concentrate on her game despite
ﬁany catcalls from the stands.
“When we’re in a game, nothing
phases us,” said Koziol, who spent
herfreshman year at Pitt. “There are

The Pitt News, Friday, February 24, 1984

Cleveland State breaks  
Pitt’s home win streak

certain teams we get pepped up for,
and Pitt’s one of them."

The Lady Vikings made 22 of 30
free throws, while Pitt made only 6
of l0. Mary Petrecca led all scorers
with 29 points and 10 rebounds,
while teammate Dianne Foster
added eight rebounds and 21 points.

Pitt was paced by Jennifer Bruce’s
23 points and eight boards while
Julie Callan added 17 points and
eight rebounds. Ellen Gilhooley
chipped in 12 points and eight
rebounds. Kim Tirik, the conference
leader in total assists with l7l,
handed out 11 more against
Cleveland.

The Lady Panthers put their share
of first place on the line tomorrow
night when they travel to Massachu-
setts to take on Boston College. Two
weeks ago, Pitt would have been a
clear-cut favorite. After the team’s
most recent defeat, however, one is
left wondering.

Pitt is tied for first at 5-2 in the Big
East with Providence, St. John's and
Villanova. Syracuse ambushed Pitt
over the weekend and has moved
into a tie for fifth at 4-3 with Seton
Hall, while Connecticut remains
winless.

“Anyone can get hot at the
EWLS," Stottlemyer said.

Penn State and Cleveland State
should be the teams to beat in the
championships. The Nittany Lions
have the depth to take places at
every weight. Two wrestlers, Carl
DeStenf1nis at ll8 lbs. and Dave
Sefter at heavyweight are going for
their fourth EWL titles.

The Vikings’ strength lies in indi-
vidual talent, such as Dan F oldesy at
126 lbs. and Matt Dulka at l77 lbs.,
who are both going for a third title.
Cleveland State is also strong at the
heavyweight class, where Matt
Ghaffari is among the league’s lead-
ing scorers.

Action starts at 12:30 p.m. today,
with the semi-finals and consola-
tions this evening at 7:00. The third
round is scheduled tommorrow at
12:30 p.m., with the finals starting at
7:30 p.m. '

The champions and runners-up in
the tournament willadvance to the
NCAA Tournament at the Mea-
dowlands March 9-I0, and three
“wild-card” spots will also qualify.
