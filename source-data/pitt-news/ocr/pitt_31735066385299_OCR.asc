Pitt
receives
“energy
grant

By Jim Tezak
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
has received a $955,000 fed-
eral grant for research in find-
ing ways to remove sulfur and
other mineral matter from coal
to make it more energy effi-
cient and environmentally
safe.

The U.S. Department of
Energy awarded the grant to
Pitt's School of Engineering to
begin a three—year program to
develop techniques to en-
hance the separation of impu-
rities, especially sulfur
compounds, from the surface
of coal particles.

The project leaders are
Professor Badie L. Morsi and
Professor Shiao—Hung Chiang,
both of Pitt's chemical en-
gineering department. I
3' By finding ways to control
the surface of coal particles, a
higher ejection of mineral im-
purities can be achieved, Mor-
si said.

According to Morsi, cleaner
coal is a more efficient source
of energy. Reducing the sulfur
content of coal could also
have a beneficial impact on
the environment.

Although it has not been
proven conclusively, sulfur di-
oxide emission from burning
coal is suspected to be one of
the primary sources of acid
rain, according to Chiang.

”Burning coal impacts on
the environment, especially
the emission of sulfur diox-
ides. Providing cleaner coal is
one way to lessen the environ-
mental impact,” Chiang said.

The coal industry and utili-
gties would benefit the most
from clean coal technology,
but many would benefit in one
way or another, according to
Chiang.

”Anybody using power
would benefit from this tech-
nology,” he said.

The department of Energy
chose Pitt as the recipient of
the grant due to the resources
available here and a very well-
structured proposal submitted
by the chemical engineering
department. The department
has also been involved in
other types of clean-coal
research for the past eight

years.

Reagan sets tenative goals for Soviet summit

By Barry Schweid

AP Diplomatic Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) —— Presi-
dent Reagan set limited goals
Tuesday for his meeting early
next month in New York with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gor-
bachev, saying it would not be in
the nature of a summit.

B-ut mindful of Gorbachev’s es-
calation of their agenda in
Iceland two years ago, Reagan

said, ”We’ll just have to see what
comes up."

The meeting, to be held in con-
junction with a speech by Gor-
bachev to the U.N. General
Assembly, would ease the transi-
tion to President—elect George
Bush's assumption of office o_n
Jan. 20.

Bush, who is already commit-
ted to pursuing a summit with
Gorbachev next year, will partic-
ipate in the session and not see

[the Soviet leader separately,

White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said. He said the agen-
da has not been set. A

The target date for the meeting
is Dec. 7. Secretary of State Ge-
orge P. Shultz is due in Brussels
to attend a meeting of North At-
lantic Treaty Organization foreign
ministers Dec. 8-9.

Gorbachev proposed the meet-
ing with Reagan and Bush
through Soviet Ambassador Yuri

V. Dubinin a few days ago, said
a U.S. official, who spoke on con-—
dition of anonymity, and Reagan
readily accepted;

The president told reporters he
anticipated "a brief get-together”
with the Soviet leader. They have
held four summits in the last three
years and improved superpower
relations. The principal achieve-
ment was the treaty Reagan and
Gorbachev signed last December

SGB candidates questioned on board’s power

By Stephanie Myers
Staff Writer

Student Government Board
candidates were asked yesterday
to explain why the SGB should
be responsible for allocating
funds to student activities. "

Julie Shepard: ”SGB should be
responsible for it, simply because
if you let 150 different organiza-
tions try to balance that amount
of money, you will have worse
chaos than you would already
have with one governing body
doing the allocations. It's just
more practical having one stu-

I dent body [SGB] that has interac-

tion with all the different groups
allocating those funds as kind of
an arbitrary nonpartisan group.”

Justin Lawhead: ”| feel this is
probably the most important or-

ganization that could use this

money. The Student Government
Board interacts more than any
[other] student organization. I
can't understand how any other
organization could do this. I think
by voting for a member means
that you have control over your
activities.

I'm not sure a lot of people
know who the candidates are or
who they are voting for, but I
think if you have a body that

knows how to allocate funds, it
would be a really good group.”

Elissa Klein: ‘'1 think [the] main
reason is that you need an impar-
tial body, and although different
members of SGB are in other or-
ganizations, I believe they are im-
partial.

[The board is] designated as the
student organization to oversee
all the other student groups. That
is [its] entire purpose.

I think it would really be impar-
tial if you had a representative
from each group. This way, hope-
fully, a lot of the present groups
that aren't getting involved in the
election process will. If they were

more involved in electing us, I
think they would believe they
were better represented.

I believe that the allocation sys-
tem, the way it is done right now,
is a good process. There are little
things that need to be changed,
but I think overall it is good."

Robyn Dion: "We are elected,
right? So we are for the voice of
the students, and we do deal with
all the student activities.

If we are elected by the stu-
dents, therefore, people must
want us to represent them. We in-
teract with these organizations,
so we know best how to allocate

-Biushiasks Brady to stay as Treasury secretary  

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ Presi-
dent-elect George Bush asked
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bra-
dy to remain in his current post
in the new administration
Monday.

Brady is a former investment
banker who served briefly as an
appointed member of the Senate.
He is a longtime friend of the
president-elect, and was a key

member of a circle of advisers I

that Bush leaned on during his
successful presidential campaign.

The appointment marked the
second time that Bush has turned
to a longtime confidante to fill a
key post in his administration.
Secretary of Statedesignate James
A. Baker 111 was Bush's first Cabi-
net appointment, announced the
morning after his election last
week.

Bush mad.e the appointment
outside the official vice presi-
dent's residence after meeting pri-
vately with visiting West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

Brady's appointment came as

. no surprise. President Reagan ap-

pointed Brady to his Cabinet post
last summer, and it was long ex-

schedule)

it tickets remain.

pected that Bush would keep his
old friend in the Cabinet if he
won the presidential election.
Bush made the appointment in
an uncertain international eco-
nomic atmosphere. The value of
the dollar fell sharply last week,
dragging down stock prices as
well because of investor fears
over Bush's economic policies.

Synthetic drug busts
made in Pittsburgh

PITTSBURGH (AP) -— Three
suspects arrested Tuesday were
the first of several people police
said they expect to apprehend in
the distribution of a synthetic
drug that may figure in 13 recent
deaths and 64 other overdoses.

”More arrests are imminent,”
Assistant Chief Chester Howard
said after the three were arrested
on charges of distributing the
drug, known as China White.

Investigators believe the arrests
got them ”one step away from
the primary source,” Howard
said.

In a raid of an apartment where
two of the suspects live, detec-

tives confiscated cocaine, heroin
and an estimated half-ounce of
what police suspect is methyl-
fentanyl, or China White. The lat-
ter is similar to heroin but much
more powerful.

1 Suit against Pa. state

police officer settled

PITTSBURGH (AP) — A lawsuit
against a state police lieutenant
was settled four days after a fed-
eral jury ruled the officer went
too far when he struck a
schizophrenic Westmoreland
County teen-ager in an attempt to

subdue him.
The agreement was reached

Monday as a jury stood by to de-
termine monetary damages in the
case. The jury ruled Thursday that
James P. Corcoran, 42, of Greens-
burg was liable for injuries to

Kevin Heltebran, now 23, of.

Madison on Sept. 3, 1984.

U.S. District Judge William L.
Standish sealed the record of the
settlement, preventing public dis-
closure.

Expensive catheters
may be unnecessary

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ The
expensive practice of using bal-
loon catheters to force open heart
arteries immediately after heart
attacks, now routinely done at
many large hospitals, is unneces-
sary and should be abandoned,
according to a major study
released Tuesday.

The study found that if heart at-

dissolving drugs, they usually .

don't need the extra step of the
common balloon procedure,
known as angioplasty.

American views the ugly side of English competition

Holding a steaming cup of
coffee in Roker Park, England, I

Q waited for the football game to

begin. A 12-year-old boy shout-
ed heavily accented obscenities
at us from the other side of the

railing.

As one of the 14 fans support-
ing Gi||ingham’s football team —
English football, by the way, is
the same as American soccer —
I stood shivering in'the small,
fenced-off section while 14,000
Sunderland fans, a large crowd
by English standards, screamed
and shouted at us from other
parts of the stadium.

Throughout England, a country ,

where unemployment is high,

Summit

in Washington to abolish U.S.
and Soviet intermediate-range

' nuclear weapons.

Reagan, asked about seeing
Gorbachev again, said ”that's not
going to be anything in the nature
of a summit meeting.” He ac-
knowledged, however, that he
had ”no way of speculating"

, what proposals the Soviet leader

might offer.

Other U.S. officials said the
agenda would be worked out in
diplomatic exchanges between
Washington and Moscow. ”Like-

wise, the nature of the meeting/’,._

said State Department spokesman
Charles E. Redman.
Before Reagan and Gorbachev

O met in Reykjavik, the capital of

Iceland, in October 1986, U.S.
officials had limited expectations
of their agenda. But the two lead-
ers proceeded to reach tentative
judgments about wide-ranging
reductions in their nuclear ar-
senals. The summit broke up in
a disagreement over Reagan's
anti—missile Strategic Defense In-
itiative.

Bush has already said he did
not need a get-acquainted meet-
ing with Gorbachev, having met
him during the Soviet leader's
visit to _ Washington. The
president-elect has said he would
like to hold a summit meeting
provided it held out promise of
progress in any one of several
areas, including arms control and

human rights.
But first, Bush said, he would
have James A. Baker Ill, his

choice for secretary of state, meet
with Soviet Foreign Minister Edu-
ard A. Shevardnadze and with
NATO foreign ministers.

”What I want to see is
progress,” Bush said Wednesday.
”l’ve never supported meetings
just for the sake of having
meetings.”

In Moscow, Soviet Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov described the meeting
as part of ”a continuation of the
U.S.-Soviet political dialogue that
we believe should continue
without artificial pause.”

Several major issues in the
U.S.-Soviet relationship are on
the brink of resolution.

many out-of-work‘ youths spend
their time at the football stadiums
or rugby fields.

Though camaraderie exists
among most of the fans, there are
some who come to fight and jeer.
Sometimes hooliganswho want
to fight wear the opposing teams’
scarves and imitate their accents
in order to be let in to the
reserved sections.

A young boy dressed in a jean
jacket, blue jeans and a Sunder-
land team scarf and cap picked
up a foam cup to toss at us. One
of the police officers quickly
grabbed his arm, made him drop
the cup and, with the help of
three other officers, escorted the
young boy out of the stadium.

The police and government still
debate different ways of keeping
order during English football
matches. ‘

An electric fence was erected I

to divide the opposing and home
team fan sections in Chelsea. But
people argued that it was inhu-
mane, and the fence was taken
down.

In other areas,‘police officials
considered using powerful hoses
to spray fighting fans with yellow
paint so it would be easier to find
and arrest them after the match.

Despite the rivalry between
Sunderland and Gillingham, ex-
treme tactics for maintaining ord-
er were not used.

When we entered the gates of
our section, the police officers
kept a close lookout for bottles or
anything that could be thrown
during the match. They also
turned away anyone who had al-
cohol on his breath.

Anyone wearing steel-tipped
boots was stopped by the police
and asked to hand over his shoe-
laces. This prevented fans from

 

kicking and seriously hurting
others during fights in the stadi-
um. After the game, the fans
could retrieve their shoelaces at
the local police station.

Along the walkway next to us,
nine police officers dressed in
traditional black uniforms and

‘ helmets stared ominously as the

crowds of adolescent young men
leaned over the railing and glared
at our group — the enemy.

We stood quietly waiting for
the game to begin. As fans cheer-
ing for the opposing team, we
were not allowed to leave our

section during the match. After

the game, we were not allowed
out of the stadium until all of the
other fans had been ushered out.

Sunderland won the game, and
as we crowded against the gates
pushing to get out, the jubilant
fans for the winning team
marched by cheering and singing

their team song.

lmpatiently, I wondered why,

we, the fans who hadn't caused
any trouble, had to wait inside
the gates.

An older man stood next to me
tugging at his Gillingham scarf. I
had watched him earlier in our
section as he had paid close at-
tention to the game, cheering the
players on and ignoring the youn-
ger fans.

Now, at the gate, he stood and
swore quietly, looking disap-
pointed. As one of the police
officers started to unlock the gate,
he looked over at me, smiled and
said, ”Maybe next time.”

Pitt graduate student Shawn
Wright never claimed that he
could speak French. Nor could
he speak Lingala, for that matter.

The United States Peace Corps
changed that.

Wright, who served for two
years in Zaire, had to learn both
languages in order to communi-

cate with the locals.

”We were totally immersed in
the new languages. They were all
we spoke 24 hours a day," he
said. ’’I would have had to pay
the Berlitz school thousands of
dollars to learn a new language
in so short a time.”

Since the Peace Corps was es-
tablished in 1961 by President
John F. Kennedy, 120,000 volun-

teers have met this challenge and
spent at least two years in a Third
World country providing health
care, technical assistance and
education to the people living
there.

According to Wright, now a
Pittsburgh area Peace Corps
representative, there are between
5,000 and 6,000 volunteers serv-
ing in 57 countries.

These volunteers range in age
from 19 to 83, and most have col-
lege degrees in a variety of sub-
jects, from biology to nursing to
English.

The Peace Corps recommends
that an interested person apply
nine to 12 months prior to the
date he is available to begin
training.

The comprehensive applica-
tion form includes a section in
which the prospective volunteer
can indicate the countries in

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November l6, T988

which he or she would prefer to
serve or, perhaps, prefer not to
serve.

According to Wright, the Peace
Corps tries to send volunteers to
their preferred areas, but this isn't
always possible.

”The host country will ask for
a volunteer with a certain back-
ground,” he said.

If the country the volunteer re-
quests doesn't need anyone with
his or her background, the Corps
will offer the volunteer an assign-
ment in another country. '

Upon acceptance of an assign-
ment, the volunteer is flown at
the Peace Corps’ expense to the
indicated country, where he or
she will begin a three month
training period.

The three major aspects of the
training period are designed not
only to provide the volunteer
skills in a specialized area, but to

Technical training prepares the
volunteers for the jobs they have
taken on, while cross—cultural
training is an anthropological

United States and the host
country.

Language training, the third
aspect, teaches the volunteers to
communicate in countries where
English isn't widely spoken.

All expenses related to service,
including travel, medical and
housing bills and vacation al-
lowance (45 days over two
years), are covered by the Peace
Corps, which also gives volun-
teers local currency to cover
food, essentials and spending
money. ,

. cil, the PLO. renounced terrorism of any kind and accept-
ed U.N. Resolution 242, which recognizes Israel's right

to exist.

9 This move by the PLO is politically a good one for it..
It is a culmination of the PLO’s struggle to regain some
power in the Middle East and the uprisings going on in
Israel's occupied territories. It gives some substance to the
PLO’s claim of an independent Palestinian state in the
Gaza Strip and the»West Bank, a claim it also made dur-

ing this meeting.

This is a new look for an organization known for its ter-
rorist activities and its goal of destroying Israel. This change
owill probably allow Israel to deal with the PLO more ef-
fectively, since this PLO is fighting through acceptable po-

litical means.

It must be understood that while it is clear that the PLO’s
policies are changing, it is not clear that its motives are
changing too. But a more politically solid PLO is much
easier for the United States to deal with.

Israel, however, is becoming more ri‘ght—wing and will
probably be unwilling to negotiate the release of the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank. After decades of sneak attacks
and terrorism, Israel is understandably wary of the PLO.»

This is a PLO that must be_dealt with by Israel. This is
a PLO that is more visible, more reasonable and more ac-
ceptable to the United States and the rest of the world.

The PLO has begun to make some concessions in its
fight for an independent homeland, and Israel should be

I. willing to at least begin negotiating with it. Otherwise,

the fighting that has been going on since 1948 will not

end.

Stop crying and complaining

It was bad enough having to
read the biased, left—wing,
bleeding-heart liberal Pitt News
during the campaign. I figured
that [you would] stop printing

your anti-Republican propaganda ‘

once the election was over. I was

‘wrong. The bias continues.‘ It's no

longer in the form of Bush and
Quayle bashing, but now it's
your Crybaby complaining about
losing the election. The Nov. 14
columns by Michelle O'Brien
and Michele Quinn are cases in
point. After reading Ms. Quinn's
column, I feel that she should
have run for president. Let's trace
her chain of logic. Mort, Geraldo,
Phil, and Oprah run sensation-

_ alist talk shows. These shows are

very popular today. According to
Ms. Quinn, the popularity of
these shows means that most
Americans are idiots. This idiocy
on the part of the American peo-
ple, according to Ms. Quinn, is
the reason why George Bush was
elected. Well Ms. Quinn, if
you're so much more intelligent
than the rest of the American peo-
ple, why didn't you run for
president?

Pemi State Sucks

My friends and I went on a
road trip to Penn State for the

LETTERS

game this pasttweekend. Unfor-
tunately,  three of.us had no
other choice but to sit in the Penn
State student section.

In the past, Penn State fans
have said that Pitt fans have no
class due to the fact that we wear
shirts and buttons that have crea-
tive slogans such as "PENN
STATE SUCKS" [and] "FU PSU".
 They also don't like the fact
that Pitt students scream "PENN
STATE SUCKS!!" during one of
the band's victory ‘songs.

[...] Imagine how shocked my
friends and I were when the PSU
fans started chanting, ”P|TT IS

SH-T" or "SH-T ON PITT"  be— »

fore and during the game.  Im-
agine that, PSU fans actually
acting in the same unclassy ways
as Pitt fans. [...]

One thing that I did find that
was pretty unclassy was the
marshmallow throwing. [...]

What I really don't understand
is that the people that get hit by
the frozen marshmallows aren't
necessarily obnoxious fans root-
ing for the opposing team (as one
would think), but the students ac-
tually try to hit each other for no
apparent reason... NOW THAT'S

- "scrod"

Green scrod and ham...

After reading the amusing arti-
cles concerning the cafeteria in
Wednesday's edition of The Pitt
News, my friends and I wanted
to comment on one of our
favorite peeves about the cafeter-
ia: It is something the menu refers
to  two or three times a week
as SCROD. I

Being ignorant freshmen, we

had no way of knowing [what] *

the word scrod meant. We
thought that when we reached
the hotpans containing the
delicacy of the day that we would
soon find out about this strange
curiosity called scrod. How
wrong we were! [...]

After our delightful dinner of
beeftips over rice, we returned to
our rooms to look up the word
in the Randomhouse
College Dictionary, and this is
what we found: "A young Atlan-
tic cod or haddock.” (For some
reason, it seems that the origin of
scrod is unknown.)

Needless to say, we were not
too thrilled to find out that the
cafeteria was serving something
of unknown origin.

Bush looking strong and standing tall during first barrage

The verdict of Americans on
the selection of the next president
was hardly in before those on the
loser’s side were busy telling
George Bush how to lead the

., nation.

USA Today, which takes a
decidedly liberal tilt in its editori-
al policy, ran a headline on an
editorial that said, "Bush Must
Pursue a Realistic Agenda." The
article said that, in facing "reali—
ty," Bush must "ignore unrealis-
tic and philosophical agendas
[which] don't solve problems;
they cause problems."

"I can't do it their way," said
Bush. "I can't accept what I call
the liberal agenda. That's what
this election is all about."

Indeed it was. Bush believes in
the Golden Rule, the one that
goes, "He who has the gold
makes the rules.” It is now Bush's
prerogative to set the tone and
agenda for the next four years.

Those who have leveled the
criticism that Bush has shifted po-
sitions over the years overlook an
important ingredient in the man.
While he holds some core prin-
ciples, he is willing to listen and

CAL
THOMAS

change his mind on other issues
if he can be persuaded he is
wrong. That's rare in any poli-
tician.

In terms of standing firm on
core principles, Bush has learned
an important lesson from Ronald
Reagan, the man to whom he
owes his presidency. Asked what
he has learned from the Gipper,

-Bush said, "He takes a principled

position and stays with it  He
fights for it."

At the news conference, Bush
was asked about Reagan's princi-

pled position on aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras. How high a
priority would such aid be in his
administration? Bush said it
would be a ”high priority" and
that he intended to try to "keep
the pressure on" the Sandinistas
because "freedom and democra-

‘ cy have a high priority.”

Asked about the so-called ”so-
cial issues” that liberals do not
want him to pursue, Bush en-
couraged conservatives when he
said, "I feel very strongly about
these issues.” While he said he
would not use a judge's position.
on abortion as a ''litmus test," he
defined what would serve as a lit-
mus test:

"What I have is a test for
whether, in my view, they will
legislate from the bench, in
which case I wouldn't want
them, or whether they will faith-
fully interpret the Constitution, in
which case I would."

Bush has indicated to me on
several occasions that he believes
the Supreme Court acted in a
legislative manner when it ap-
proved abortion on demand. So
while Bush may not call abortion
a litmus test, the way a judicial
candidate views the Court's abor-
tion ruling as it relates to the Con-
stitution may be such a test. In
that event, the results ought to be
the same.

(Abortion, by the way, was the
most-often cited issue in an ABC
News exit survey of voters, with
one-third listing it as a key issue.
Not the economy. Not foreign af-
fairs. Not even prison furloughs
or the - Pledge of Allegiance.

Those who cited it went for Bush.

Anyone looking fora "mandate"
ought to look there.)

Since the name of Harry Tru-
man was so often invoked by
Republicans during their success-
ful campaign for the White

House (Reagan said Truman
would have voted for Bush!),
perhaps a quote from Truman
about leadership might serve as
an imprimatur for the coming
Bush administration.

"A leader has to lead, or other-
wise he has no business in poli-
tics," said Truman.

Leadership is not about water-
ing down /your principles....
Leadership is about taking a po-
sition and then persuading peo-
ple , to follow you by
demonstrating that you are right.
' If George Bush follows such a
course, he could be a very suc-
cessful president. His first news
conference as president-elect, in
which he very humanly said the
impact of what he had won had
not yet fully settled in on him,
was a very good start.

Many Pitt students ‘who
thought that their participation in
elections ended with the
presidential race are quite
mistaken.

Today is the final day to cast
your vote for next year's Student
Government Board. In light of the
elections, present board mem-
bers commented yesterday on the
accomplishments of this year's
SGB.

John Scanlon said, ”The big.

thing was that we lobbied for
computers, and we did put in a

assassination. We're bringing in
experts from all over the coun-
try,” Scanlon said.

”There were also a lot of com-
plaints from students about not
having enough bike racks; we
were responsible for getting new
racks,” Scanlon said.

”We’re working on getting
more campus phones because
there is a definite shortage of
them,” he said. '

Pamela Rich said, ”Right now,
I'm in the process of setting up a
student advisory committee that
will work with the director of
housing. We will be working
with the problems of the cafeter-
ia food.”

Football team to spend holidays at home

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

For the last few weeks, the Pitt
football team had seemingly
been in the picture for a number
of postseason bowl games. The
Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas was
the first to be mentioned, but they
have opted for an Army—A|abama
matchup.

Then there is the Gator Bowl.
Pitt was expecting an invitation,
but they decided on a Michigan
State-Georgia game. The In-
dependence and the All-
American Bowls appeared in-
terested in the Panthers, but they
also ' have decided on other
teams. Where does that leave
Pitt? ’

Well, unless there is a drastic

change in the next week, the only
way the Pitt team will go to a
bowl game is if they buy their
own tickets.

”I think this team deserves to
be playing in a bowl game,”

. Coach Mike Gottfried said. ”We

can't control what goes on off the
field and behind [the] closed
doors of board of directors meet-
ings of bowl games. What is said
and done [are] two different
worlds. I felt and believed all
along that we were going to go
to a bowl.”

The Panthers are currently 6-3,
with games against North Caro-
lina State (expected to play in the
Peach Bowl) and Syracuse (head-
ed to the Hall of Fame Bowl) left.
Two of their three losses have

come at the hands of West Vir- \

Panthers defeat visiting
Cibona team, 97-82, in

first action

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

A team effort led the Pitt basket— _

ball team to 97-82 victory over
the Yugoslavian team Cibona in
an exhibition game before a
crowd of 6,047 at the Fitzgerald
Field House last night.

Junior forward Rod Brookin,
playing in his first game since be-
ing declared academically ineligi-
ble last season, led the Panthers
in scoring with 22 points, hitting
three out of four shots from the
three point line, while guard Ja-
son Matthews contributed 20
points and Prop 48 sophomore
forward Brian Shorter 13.

”l thought overall the kids
played pretty well,” said Pitt
coach Paul Evans after the Pan-
thers’ first outing of the year.
”There wasn't anybody who
played too badly.”

Aleksander Petrovic, brother of
Olympic silver medalist Drazen
Petrovic, led Cibona with 25
points on the strength of five
three—point shots, and also led the
team with seven rebounds and
six assists.

Evans had been worried that
Pitt, whose tallest player is six-
foot-nine inch sophomore center
Bobby Martin, would have a
matchup problem with the much
larger Yugoslavians, who sported
four players 6-9 or taller.

But the suprisingly quick Pan-
thers out-rebounded Cibona
43-32 and had four blocked
shots, two each by Martin and
Brookin.

Guard Darelle Porter also had
four of Pitt’s six steals.

”Most of the European teams
are physically strong butnot real-
ly quick,” said Matthews, who hit
on four of eight three-point at-
tempts, pulled down five re-
bounds and had three assists.

Evans said he was impressed
with the effort of Martin, who had
11 points and nine rebounds be-
fore picking up his fifth foul with
1:47 to play, but that Shorter
didn't play to his ability.

”Brian I thought was intimidat-
ed a little bit,” Evans said.

Cibona hit on eight of 1 7 three-
point shots, which was not supris-

of season

ing to Matthews.

”Most international teams have
a good outside shooter. I knew
they'd be shooting.”

But the Panthers may have
suprised the Yugoslavians with
their outside shooting, making 10
baskets from beyond the three-
point line. -

”We’d be doing the same if we
played Syracuse or Geor-
getown,” Matthews said.

Although Evans’ team passed
its first test, the players admitted
that there is much work still to-. be
done.

”We slowed a little bit on
defense at the end of the game,
and we have to learn to be more
comfortable,” Matthews said.

”We have to keep our intensi-
ty level up. We can't get a big
lead and let them come back/"he
added.

The Panthers led Cibona 43-23
at 8:28 of the first half, but al-
lowed the Yugoslavians to cut the
lead to six with only 4:53 to play
in the game.

”Teams are going to attack us,”
said Shorter, playing his first
game in a Pitt uniorm after sitting
out last year.

”We have to get better on man-
to-man defense and sliding to the
ball and being in the help out po-
sitions,” he commented.

Yugoslavia took advantage of
the height difference, but not so
much that Evans had to keep
Martin in the game every minute.

”Rod, suprisingly, is quick,”
said Evans of Brookin, who came
into pre-season workouts at 268
pounds but had cut his weight to
238 by last week.

When Martin was pulled from
the lineup, defense became
almost secondary point guard
Sean Miller said.

”We have to substitute a lack
of rebounding and defense for a
little scoring punch.”

But that scoring punch is what
helped the Panthes put Cibona
away last night.

The Panthers got off to a quick
start, jumping out to a 12-5 lead
in the first period. Cibona closed
the gap to one, 12-11, but the
Panthers went on a nine—point
run, five scored by Brookin, to

ginia (31-10) and Notre Dame
(30-20), the teams expected to
play for the NCAA ‘national
championship in the Fiesta Bowl.

”l’|l start out by saying that I'm
disappointed,” Pitt Athletic
Director Ed Bozik said. ”At best,
I was misled. At worst, people
were less than honest with me.
We went into that game [Penn
State] knowing that we had an
opportunity with several bowls.
We left with that same feeling.

”Between Saturday night and
Sunday evening, those possibili-
ties evaporated. We still have
some options open, but they are
relatively slim. They are not in
our control, and they require
other teams to lose.”

Pitt's hopes lie in the hands of
three very big underdogs. Michi-

make the lead 21-11 at 12:51.

Pitt was aided with two techni-
cal foul calls at 10:37, the first on
Mirko Milicevic, who was eject-
ed for scuffling with Brookin, and
the second when Yugoslavian
coach Nikola Kessler stepped
onto the playing floor.

Miller, who played on the Big
East All-Star team that toured Yu-
goslavia last summer, said the

gan State is a 31-point favorite
over Wisconsin. lf Wisconsin
were able to pull the upset, the
Panthers have a slim chance of
getting an invite from the Gator
Bowl.

lf Wake Forest were to lose to
Division l-AA Appalachian State,
Pitt will have a small chance to
play in the Independence Bowl.
But, as reported in yesterday's
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, they
seem to be leaning toward Texas-
El Paso.

That last hope for Pitt would be
if Illinois were to lose to North-
western. The lllini are currently
17-point favorites. Illinois will
play Florida in the All-American
Bowl.

This is provided Pitt beats the
Wolfpack this Saturday, but last

players and referees come in
much closer contact in interna-
tional games than those played in
the United States.

’’It was even crazier over
there,” Miller said.

The Panthers allowed the Yu-
goslavian team to get no closer
than seven points for the rest of
the first half, outscoring them
38-35 for a 59-46 halftime lead.

week's Penn State game was sup-
posed to be the key game in the
scenario. When Pitt won 14-7, it
was thought that they were as-
sured a bowl bid.

”l was told going into Satur-
day's ball game that we are num-
ber one on their list, and after the
ball game you're number one on
our list,” Bozik said. ”That’s what
I'm objecting to. I object to be-
ing misled.”

Bozik also said that bowl game
officials could affect Pitt's stature
in the eyes of other committees.

”lf one bowl tells another bowl
that Pittsburgh is the number one
team on [its] list, that would great-
ly affectzthings,” Bozik said. ”l
think that, in part, happened -this
weekend.” ’

with Pitt's play early in the se-

NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) —
A proposal to rename a street
now memorializ_ing a U.S.
president to honor hometown
baseball hero Tommy Lasorda
has run into opposition and
has been shelved —- at least
temporarily.

Councilman Anthony Clan-
ciulli suggested the tree-lined
Harding Boulevard, named for
the late Warren G. Harding,
should be changed to Lasorda
Boulevard in honor of the
manager of the World Series

champion Los Angeles Dodg-
ers. Lasorda grew up in Nor-
ristown and still has family in
the area.

But residents of the street in
this suburban Philadelphia
community, many of whom
are elderly and retired, op-
posed the idea.

’’I’m not opposed to honor-
ing him; I grew up with him,”
said Anthony Monaco, a
retiree living on the street. But
Monaco said he would have
to file more than 150 changes

Dodgers manager Lasorda may
get hometown street in his name

of address if the street were
renamed.

A questionnaire to 77
homeowners found over-
whelming opposition, includ-
ing a petition from 93 people

-against the name change.

’’Personally I'm not against
the idea,” Councilman Jeff Zo-
litor said, ”but the people
don't want it. That's very
clear.”

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — lf
Michigan State wins its game
Saturday against Wisconsin, it

favorite over visiting Wisconsin,
which has a 1-9 record.

”The thing that impressed the
selection committee is that they
are the Rose Bowl champions of
last year and will be runners-up
inthe Big Ten if they win,” said
John Bell, executive director of
the Gator Bowl.

”Michigan State has only one
Big Ten loss in two years, and
with that kind ‘of background,
having that kind of record, we
think they would be a very fine
opponent for Georgia,” said Bell.

if the Spartans lose Saturday,
however, Bell said the committee
would then look to Pittsburgh, a

and Syracuse.

Georgia, 7-3, with a game re-

Luxbacher has hopes for better season in '89

By Mike Rampa

Staff Writer

Soccer coach Joe Luxbacher
believes he will have a strong
nucleus returning next year from
this season's 6-8-1 team.

Luxbacher feels his squad’s
record this season was not a
reflection of their play or talent.
However, he acknowledged the
fact that the Panthers are missing
a ”star player.”

In other words, they lack a
productive goal scorer who
would put the team over the top.

’’I honestly think that the team

one I had a few years ago when
we were 10 and 5, but for a num-
ber of reasons, our record didn't
show it,” Luxbacher said. ”We
can play with anyone in the Big
East, and we were not over-
matched all season.”

Pitt's 10-5 team had players
who consistently scored about
every three games. This year,
there was no one like that.

”lt’s not like it's a team thing,
we're just missing one or two
players that would put us over the
edge. Next year, we've got the
guys to fill the graduating seniors’
shoes, but the key is to get some
guys in who can hopefully help

us up front,” Luxbacher said.
Luxbacher expressed en-
thusiasm for the potential of fresh-
man striker Mike Laus, but stated
that his size and strength could be
a definite problem. In order for
Laus to be effective, Luxbacher
said, ”He needs a big, strong
player up there with him who can
win the ball for him. Then once
Mike gets the ball, he can do
things and be effective.”
Luxbacher is confident about
his returning defensemen and
goalkeepers and is extremely
pleased with the recruiting year,
namely the acquisitions ofHeinz

whom will return next season.
The defense has had its hands
full all season marking dangerous
goal scoring threats such as Buck-
nel|'s Dave Domshon, Seton
Hall's Pat O’Kelley and George-
town’s Andy Hoffman. By com-
mitting their best defenders on a
single player, Pitt opens up
chances for the rest of the oppo-
sition. Opposing defenders have
a chance to become involved in
setting up an offensive attack.
’’If I were coaching against our
team, it would be hard to say
who I'd have to concentrate on
because nobody would give me
any problems,” Luxbacher said.
”They [opposing teams] don't
have to take their top defenders
out of the attack like we always
do. By having good forwards, it
eases the task of the defense, and,
in turn, actually creates more

offensive opportunities, and we
don't have that capability right
now.”

A curious fact concerning the
rosters of many of the top Big East
teams is that they are stocked
with foreign players. Wake Forest
went from being an average team
to a top 10 contender because of
foreign scholarships, which es-
sentially brought in an entirely
new team. Seton Hall, No. 1 in
the Big East, boasts eight Irish
players on their roster.

Luxbacher does not see the
need to actively recruit foreign
players. ”|t’s my own personal
philosophy to build with the
homegrown talent. In order to try
to develop the game, we should
be trying to develop American
players.”

Luxbacher acknowledges that

Continued from page 9

Bozik would not comment on
which bowls were involved in
this.

Another -reason that bowl
games would pick another team
over Pitt is that the Panthers are
an independent team and bowls
may want a team that plays in a
conference. They could be a big-
ger draw and get higher televi-
sion ratings.

”Conferences go out and make
packages with bowl commit-
tees,” Bozik said. ’’If you take a
look at the teams that are going,
there are packages that are made.
If you are an independent, the up-
side of that is, man, you get
everything that you win; you
keep everything. The downside is
that you can't make a package.
You can't make an attractive
package, and the bowls sure as
hell won't make it for you.

”This is tough to swallow,” O
Gottfried said. ’’I think maybe the
bowl system will have to be
reviewed and something else will
have to be done. I just hope we
can continue to improve and fin-
ish the season on a high note.”

those in a couple weeks, when
we get a few more pounds off
him.” .

and the other a perfectionist,
their domestic life becomes a
battlefield of verbal jabs in a

’’In each conference you'll
have two teams that are pretty at-
tractive, and sometimes three or
four. For the rest, the attractive
ones go out and make a package
for the bowls. They have a
guaranteed following and guaran-
teed ticket sales.’’

Bozik would not comment at
this time whether or not this was
the case, saying, ”To say any-
thing at this time would be like
sour grapes.”

The Pitt team cannot help but
be affected by the change of
events. The whole college season
is geared toward a bowl game.
With two games left and a very
slim chance of a bowl, the team
could lack the motivation need-
ed to finish the season on a high
note. Gottfried hopes to guard
against anything like that hap-
pening.

”You have to worry about
everything,” Gottfried said. ”The

a lot of positive things going on
here that are positive, and we
have to sell our kids on those
things.”

Freshman Curvin Richards has
had as good a season as any run-
ner ,in the NCAA this season
(1,091 yards on the ground). He
is a leading contender for Fresh-
man of the Year honors. His ever-
present smile left his face when
he talked about the bowl sit-
uation.

’’I’d much rather go to a bowl
game than win any kind of
award,” Richards said. ”That’s
the most important thing to me.
The individual awards are nice,

feels that the team may be a little
down but knows that they are‘
good enough to do anything.

”Everybody is a little disap-
pointed, but we always felt that
if we are good enough, then we'll
go,” Chelenski said. ”We just
have to go out and show thes_e
teams that we should be in a
bowl, and we are going to play
real hard. We are going to prove
to everybody that we should be
there.”

Last season, the Panthers were
able to play in the Bluebonnet
Bowl with an 8-3 record. This
season, 8-3 won't be good
enough; they will just have to
pick up the pieces and finish the
season.

perhaps a few foreign players
would give him the ”quick fix”
the team could have in order to
win games but prefers to develop
the soccer program his way. Also
a problem is the amount of
scholarship money available for
the soccer program, which may
substantially limit the quantity of

‘ players available.

Usually, most strikers are for-
eign, and Luxbacher attributes
the lack of prevalent American
strikers to the way youth soccer
is being taught in this country.

I ”First of all, youth soccer is
played with too many people on
the field. You've got little kids
running aroud on a huge field,‘
and some of them never even
touch the ball. Second, kids are
taught to pass frequently and to
clear the ball once it gets any-
where near the goal. There's no

THE P|Tl' NEWS, Wednesday, November 16, i988

chance to develop individual
skills such as dribbling,” he said.

Transfer Mark Mostinckx be-
lieves that if the Pitt soccer team
were a consistent Big East con-
tender, the university would have
less of a problem attracting su-
perior local talent.

’’If we went to the Big East tour-
nament every year, you would
hear a lot more about us. I think
the soccer program here is excel-
lent, but the fact that we are not

a winning team doesn't give us as A

much positive exposure as we
would like,” Mostinckx said.

Commenting on the season,
Mostinckx is generally satisfied
with the team's progress but said
that perhaps everyone's expecta-
tions were a bit too high.

’’I think everyone thought that
Heinz [Pak] and I would bring ex-
perience to the team and that we

would immediately take off 
that we would gel in a couple of
games. But it's taken a whole sea-
son for us to get used to playing
with each other,” Mostinckx said.

Mostinckx expressed optimism
for the upcoming season, noting
the return of many promising
young players, and he thinks that
the premature expectations prior
to this season will become a real-
ity next year.

Youth will once again be the
key element in next season's
squad. Scott McCurry, Austin
Grace, Mike Blatz, Brian Pel|egri—
no and Mike Laus are just a few

players who will have a chance i

to make the Panthers a more
competitve team in the Big East.
Luxbacher hopes his team's ta-

lent and potential will be reflect-.

ed in a winning record in the
1989 campaign.
