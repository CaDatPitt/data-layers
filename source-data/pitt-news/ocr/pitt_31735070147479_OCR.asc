Compost a new item for RecycleMania

Shaé Felicien
I Staff Writer

Everything has its place in the circle
of life — even the remains of the
mustard, spaghetti, onion and meat-
ball concoction that you scraped off
your plate after dinner last night. /

This is the third year Pitt has en-
tered RecycleMania — an armual
recycling competition that stretches
across more than 400 colleges in the
U.S. and parts of Canada —'— but a
new twist to the competition means
Pitt will be gathering more than the A
usual cardboard and plastic.

For the ﬁrst time, Pitt will be

entered into a new category of the
competition — food service organ-
ics, or compost.

Sony Rane, the marketing and
sustainability coordinator at So-
dexo, said only the leftover food
from Market Central will get com-
posted.

“It’s our ﬁrst year including our
composting waste reduction in our
RecycleMania results. Our compost-

ing system right now is reducing

85 percent of the overall volume
of the waste that is compostable,”
she said.»

With the help of Sodexo’s new

industrial composter, Pitt can re-
duce waste from leftover food by

85 percent. - .

But scraps from the table aren’t
the only aspect of the competition.
This year, organizers at Pitt have
raised their expectations for the
competition.

According to Laura Zullo, se-
nior manager of energy initiatives

 at Facilities Management, last year
the University recycled nearly half

a million pounds of paper, bottles
and cans, and corrugated cardboard
— a signiﬁcant increase from 2009,
when the University recycled more
than 120,000 pounds of material.
Zullo attributed the increase to
the expansion of the competition to

the entire campus and not just Pitt’s .

residence halls.

This year, Pitt is hoping to recycle
540,000, or 270 tons, of recyclable
material.

A “We have an overall goal of re-
cycling 540,000 pounds of recy-
clables and that averages out to be

7 12 pounds of recyclables per person

over the course of the eight-week
competition,” said Allison Plummer,
student sustainability coordinator
for Pitt’s housing department.

Fareboxes

to come
by March

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Riding on the Port Authority will
take a new spin in the next few
months, when -Pitt- students will
serve’ as guinea pigs for a new'tran-
sit program.

Over the next two months, the
Port Authority will install its new
fareboxes — originally meant for
last year 4 on many buses travel-
ing through Oakland, according

, ;_tO_ ,Port,,Auth0rity spokesman Jim

Ritchie.

The new addition means Pitt
students will need to tap their Pan-
ther Cards on an orange square on
the farebox to enter the bus.

Pitt issued the Panther Cards
with the new technology last year,
Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said.

The program for Pitt students
will serve as a pilot for a general
program in the city that will start
in 2011.

Pitt students using the new fare-
boxes “will help us very much be-
fore we start with the whole city,”
Ritchie said. “We want to learn a bit
from Pitt’s use of the system?’

Ritchie said that they intend
on checking two factors with the
upcoming pilot at Pitt: to make
sure the fareboxes work at a large
scale, and that their data-gathering
program wo rks.

The new fareboxes will allow the
Port-Authority to track ridership

Pitt officials mum about football program

Pitt officials decline to comment throughout selection process for football coach

Ryan Shaughnessy
For The Pitt News

The football controversy that dominated
headlines during the ﬁrst few weeks of]anu-
ary has subsided, but a reﬂection on how
the Pitt football program went from Dave
Wannstedt to Michael Haywood to Todd
Graham reveals a tight—lipped administra-
tion that did little to inform students about
the process.

During the weeks of Haywood’s arrest,
Pitt officials communicated primarily
through statements, news releases and the
occasional, selective press conferences.

Pitt officials have repeatedly denied re-
quests for additional comment on the pro-
cess during the past several weeks.

The whole situation began on Dec. 7
when, after a 7-5 season, former head foot-
ball coach Wannstedt resigned. He was with
the football team for six seasons.

Wannstedt, who had a contract with Pitt
until 2014, was offered the position of spe-
cial assistant to the athletic director, but
Pitt did not release details of the contract,
including how much he would be paid.

The position was specially created for
Wannstedt.

Eight days after Wannstedt’s resignation,
Athletic Director Steve Pederson hired Hay-
wood as Pitt’s new head coach. Pitt ofﬁcials
did not release any information about the
search in the interim.

Haywood, who was the head coach for
Miami University (OH), led the team to a
10-4 record during the 2010 season and
ﬁnished with a division title in the 2010
Middle Atlantic Conference East and a win in
the 2009 GoDaddy.com Bowl against Middle
Tennessee. A j

Two and a half weeks after he was hired,
Haywood was arrested on charges of do-
mestic battery. ' ~

Onjan. 1, he was ﬁred. A statement Pitt

released at the time said that the Univer- ‘

sity’s decision did not reﬂect on Haywood’s
guilt or innocence but rather “it reﬂects a
strong belief that moving forward with Mr.

Haywood as our head coach is not possible
under the existing circumstances.”
Haywood pleaded not guilty to the charg-
es and is scheduled to appear in court on
March 10. - '
A mediafrenzy erupted after New Year’s
Day, but Pitt oflicials kept communication to

a minimum, choosing _to relay information i

through statements instead of interviews.
When Pitt Athletic Department spokes-
man E.]. Borghetti was asked for further

information about the football program, p

he declined to comment.

“I might suggest you connect with one of
the reporters who attended that press con-
ference and utilize those quotes from Steve
[Pederson] since he headed up the process.
That would serve your story best, I believe,”
Borghetti said in ajan. 13 e-mail.

It wasn’t until six days later that Pederson
opened up about the situation, inviting select
media members to a conference call about
the new coaching selection process. The Pitt
News was not invited to participate in the
press conference.

During the conference, Pederson said

the post-Haywood selection process would I

involve a “small team” to evaluate potential
candidates.

This differed from the ﬁrst process in
which Pederson interviewed candidates in
December, although Pitt has not elaborated
on how much it differed. '

Borghetti said the new team, comprised .

of Pederson, Executive Vice Chancellor Je-
rome Cochran and Executive Associate Ath-
letic Director Donna Sanft, would conduct
initial candidate interviews.

Then, a smaller number of candidates
would be invited to participate in further
discussions, which would include a meeting
with Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, Bor-
ghetti said in an e-mail.

On Jan. 10, Pitt ofﬁcials declined to ex-
plain what was discussed in these interviews
or talk about any terms of thecontract.

. - . . . . . » « - . . . . . . v .

Pitt officials also initially refused to
answer why Cochran, who works as Pitt’s
general legal‘ counsel, was involved inthe

process and why it was necessary for him

to meet face-to-face with potential candi-
dates. . C

Borghetti eventually replied in an e-mail
on Jan. 14 after multiple requests for com-
ment. ~ '

“The individuals who participated are
ranking administrators within the Univer-
sity or athletic department, and own unique
and experienced perspectives on the qualiﬁ-

cations of potential candidates,” he said.

The majority of the.information regard-
ing the selection process has come from
other media sources

According to Rivals.com, an online col-
lege sports media source, it was rumored
that Pitt met with Sal Sunseri, the assistant
head coach at Alabama and Pitt quarterback
Tino Sunseri’s father, for Sunseri’s ﬁrst and
only interview on Monday, Jan. 3; with Penn
State defensive coordinator Tom Bradley
for _a ﬁrst interview on Tuesday, Jan. 4; with
Tulsa head coach Todd Graham in Atlanta,
Wisconsin offensive coordinator Paul Chryst
and Florida International head coach Mario
Cristobal on Wednesday, Jan. 5; and with
Virginia Tech defensive‘ coordinator Bud
Foster two days later.

Rivals.com also said Graham had his sec-
ond interview on Saturday, Jan. 8, meeting
with Nordenberg in Dallas. Graham denied
this, but according to Rivals.com, other
sources say he was in Dallas.

On Jan. 5, WTAE Channel 4 announced
that Pitt had agreed to sign Bradley as head

coach of the Panthers. But a few hours later,
. Borghetti deniedthe report later that day.

Last Friday,'Penn State Assistant Athletic
Director and spokesman Jeff Nelson said

Bradley was not allowed to speak about this

selection process. Ivanlrizarry, a spokesman
for Florida International University,‘ said
‘ Coaching > 4

on another bus in Downtown will show up in ‘
their system. ‘Ritchie said that the Authority _

will not track individuals’ data, just where
general riders get on or leave the bus. c

_ He said that the new data will help Port
Authority see where riders tend to travel

‘ and allow Port Authority to better respond"

to changing trends.

» “If there’s a large population going from
McCandless to Oakland for instance, we’~llbe
seeing that for the ﬁrst time,” Ritchie said.

Buses from the East Liberty Garage will
get the new fareboxes ﬁrst. Ritchie said the
garage serves many routes that go through
Oakland and the EBA, EBS and P3 routes that
use the East Busway. "

On the practical side, Ritchie said that the"
farebox card reader will be sensitive enough
that students should not have to worry about
most carrying cases being too thick.

P The technology in the card — a radio
antenna attached to a computer chip — won’t
be affected by magnets like the strips on cred-
it cards, Ritchie said. However, he said that
students need to make certain that they don’t
bend the cards or poke holes in them.

Seniors are supposed to turn in their cards
to Panther Central when they graduate to
prevent non~students from using the transit
service, ‘ Fedele said. He didn’t say whether
the radio antenna would work once the card
has expired.

. The yearlong delay in the new fareboxes
came from a problem with the machines “eat-

ing” bills. Ritchie said that the new fareboxes .

were supposed to validate currency, but some
were jamming instead when ﬁrst installed.
The PortAuthority announced Wednes-
day night that they had ﬁxed the initial prob-
lems with the new boxes and will installthem
over the next year. ' ’

“This is going to replace the old, outdat- ‘
. ed stuff that’s been there for years,” Ritchie

said. i

Waste minimization goal at 35 lb per person

each student.

“We broke down the results based on last
year’s competition and we’d like every per-
son to recycle four pounds of paper, seven
pounds of cardboard, and one pound of cans
and bottles,” Plummer, a junior, said.

Zullo noted the University’s success in not
only recycling more, but wasting less as Pitt
reduced its total waste from more than 7,000
pounds in 2004 to less than 2,000 in 2009.

Despite making strides in recycling efforts,
Pitt views the start of a new RecycleMania

competition as an opportunity to attain even
higher goals.

“We have a waste minimization goal of
35 pounds per person, which is a two-pound
reduction from last year,” Plummer said.

The housing department has made it a
point to make recycling both more convenient
and more visible during the competition.

“We’re always looking for suggestions on
where we can leave more boxes, but this is to
get people in the habit of doing it and making
recycling more prevalent,” Plummer said. “If
a location works we’ll leave a permanentbin
there.”

Pitt also added a new e—mail address,
pittrecycling@bc.pitt.edu, where students
can e—mail their recycling totals. The Univer-
sity will also use its Twitter account to remind
students to take part in the competition.

“Now that it’s our third year, it’s more out
there and students are taking more initiative
towards it. We’re doing everything that we
always have  but it’s up to the students, it
comes to the people that are recycling” said
Pat Heflley, the supervisor of the student
sustainability coordinator for the housing
department and recycling coordinator for the
RecycleMania competition.

Although the actual eight-week competi-
tion doesn’t begin until Feb. 6, the interim two
weeks will be used to gather preliminary data
of weighed recyclables. ‘

“We were number one in the Big East for
corrugated cardboard recycling last year and
placed second and third in a few other catego-
ries in the Big East,” Zullo said. “Overall we’ve
been in the top 40 percent on aper capita basis
in the competition.”

Pitt silent

on process

Coaching < 2

Cristobal was not allowed to comment on
the selection process either.

Jeff Purinton, athletic directorof Ala-
bama football, was the only one who did
comment. .

Onjan. 18, he said, “We are not going to
be able to get Coach Sunseri on the phone
with you for a couple of reasons. They are
out there recruiting now, and we normally
don’t do interviews unless it’s a special deal.
I"think this is mo re of a topic you would want
to approach Pittsburgh about rather than
Coachysunseri.”

When Pitt announced Graham as the
new head coach on Jan. 11, it still declined
to answer questions regarding the selection
process and contract terms.

But Pitt officials did publicly announce
conﬁdence in their decision.

“Todd’s innovative, creative and ener-
gized approach to football makes him an
exciting leader for our program,” Pederson
said in a news conference at the Panthers’

' South Side football facility last Tuesday. “The

outstanding job he has done at Tulsa has been
noticed around the country, and I know he is
excited to meet his new team and the great
people of Pittsburg .”

Multiple media sources have reported that
Pitt gave Graham a salary of approximately
$2 million per year, which is more than the
$1.8 million Graham-asked for. According
to ajan. 15 article in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, this con-tract makes Graham the

highest-paid employee in the public sector _

of the state of Pennsylvania.

Pitt has not released Graham’s salary, al-
though it is required to report the salaries of
its top ﬁve highest-earning employees each
year when it ﬁles its taxes.

In 2009, the last year for which statistics
are available, Wannstedt had a salary and

bonus package worth-$1.09 million. I

ing a disaster. ' ,

Hillary Gray, the woman
defending the FWB in the ar-
ticle, said that when she sees
her “friend” walk into a room,
her “heart doesn’t jump. Pe-

What I don’t agree with is

sexual partners can never be

rules. Don’t cross them'or push
them to the point of breaking.

Every “couple” has its own ben- .

eﬁts, and it’s up to you to decide
what works in your situation.

No matter what factors one
might consider, no one can say
for sure if “friends with ben-
efits” is a good idea, or if this
sort of situation can ever be
successful. But there are ways
for the chances to be in your
favor. Set boundaries that both
of you are comfortable with.

At the same time, have sex,
and for the most part, have fun.
Just don’t pretend your FWB is
your boyfriend or girlfriend.
Different expectations for the
situation translate to a likeli-
hood that one person will be
disappointed and hurt. But if
you follow the rules, there is a
great chance that your friend-
ship will last —— even after you
find true love. So enjoy FWB
while you can. I _

Attack Theatre: “Show #58”
New Hazlett Theater

Allegheny Square East

Friday and Saturday; Wednes-
day through next Saturday. at 8
p.m.

Tickets: $15 for students

If you ever need lessons on how to
dance to the clucking of a chicken,
Michele de la Reza of Attack The-
atre is a practiced professional.

Once, following a group of
performers in France that utilized
chickens, de la Reza found herself
in the surprising position of hav-
ing to commence her act with a
rogue bird making a cacophony
backstage.

In 15 seasons of creating dance,
de la Reza and co—artistic director
Peter Kope of Attack Theatre can
recall a host of memories detailing
how extraordinary and unexpected
the performing arts profession can
be. I

Tonight through next weekend,
Attack Theatre — a local dance
company known for producing

shows that are cerebral yet ath-
letic and marked by high—contact
partner dancing, inventive uses of
multimedia and a unique outlook
on staging -— will commemorate

its 15th anniversary season at the

New Hazlett Theater. This will be

their 58th production at that venue.

They have titled the show, simply,

“Show #58.”

“Ultimately,” Kope said, “Our
goal is to increase people’s comfort
level with dance as an art form.”

Meanwhile, acclaimed cellist
and Attack Theatre musical direc-
tor Dave Eggar will be celebrating’
his own professional triumph, hav-
ing recently received a Grammy
nomination for his arrangement
ofjazz composer Michael Brecker’s
original song “Itsbynne Reel.” His
band, Deoro, collaborates regularly
with the company, and will be ac-
companying it live in “Show #58.”
Eggar claims the group’s new music
will combine themes from Bach
with elements of hip-hop.

A friend of de la Reza since their
days attending thejuilliard School
in New York City, Eggar has been
working with Attack Theatre since
2000. Having traveled to some of
the world’s most remote regions,

Eggar described himself as “explor-
ing the concept of forging risky col-
laborations with musicians from
around the world.”

“Collaboration with dance push-
es me to write things that I would
never normally write  Other art
forms teach me a lot because they
are newer to me,” Eggar said.

“Show #58”  comprised of four
pieces in two acts. In the ﬁrst act
are “Typeset” (1996) and “R.A.M.”
(2010), both of which take a sep-
arate look at the involvement of
technology in people’s lives. In the
second act are “Trapped” (2008),
a piece that de la Reza describes
as “an important beginning of the
development of a body of work,”
and “Beginnings,” a brand new
piece that Kope claims is at once
“quirky, collective and cohesive.” In
choosing the pieces, Kope explains,
the artistic directors wanted “to
ﬁnd things that represent our his-
tory, but that also represent where
we’re going.”

Sometimes this involves allow-
ing the audience to play a larger role
in the performance. During shows
like “Site—Resite,” “Game Night”
and “The Seven Minute Dance Se-
ries,” for instance, company mem-

I bers will often ask for audience in-

put before performing. This might
entail the audience interpreting
a particular piece of visual art, or
coming up with a concept or theme
for the performance. The dancers

will then improvise a dance piece 5

based upon the .audience’s input.

Kope and de la_Reza said they
want to bridge the gap between
what is considered a quotidian
experience and what is considered
dance. Much of their movement is
inspired by movement that they see
from regular people every day, and
this gives their dancing a pedestri-
an, organic quality that audiences
ﬁnd accessible.

“Dancing is an art form that
people have felt less empowered
to connect with,” de la Reza said.
“We try to portray the humanity
within dance  to help people see
dance as an essential part of life
and living.”

All of the work produced by the
company is collaborative. Kope and
de la Reza are very inviting of other
people’s ideas, and often bounce
them off the musicians and other
dancers before setting a piece.

When asked how the company
has changed since its inception,

'Ivr‘.,

tically unconventional dress rehearsal per-
forrn_ance for Attack Theatre’s “Show #58.”

Kope said, “It started as a duet com-
pany. Sincethen, the company has
grown based upon the relationships
that we have  [With that,] there
has been a growth of opportuni-
ties.” The company has_added four
dancers to its original lineup.

To signify the importance of
Attack’s 15th season, Kope and de
la Reza have commissioned visual
artists T.K. Mundok, Ian Green,
Blaine Siegel and Rob‘ Rogers to
each create an interpretation of
a photograph of the two dancers
that was taken in 1996 inthe U.S.
Virgin Islands.

The black—and—white photo-
graph captures de la Reza in ﬂight,
her limbs extended in the shape
of a star. Kope is standing below
her, and only the ocean is visible"
inthe background. To both artistic
directors, the image represents a
freedom of space that they have
often tried to reproduce in their
performances. ' ,

.“[The photo] symbolizes a lot of
what Attack Theatre has become in
the last 15 years,” de la Reza said.
“That kind of risk-taking physical-
ity has been a hallmark of Attack
Theatre.” ‘

Musical revels in ‘Nunsense’

Tracey Hickey
_ Staff Writer

“Nunsense”

Now to April 17

CLO Cabaret Theater

655 Penn Ave. .
Wednesday-Saturday at 7:30 p.m.;
Saturday-Sunday at 2 p.m.; select

- Thursdays at 1 p.m.

Tickets: $15 through Pitt Arts

“Nunsense” began with a line of
greeting cards and a mannequin.
When nuns began to modern-
ize — in particular, loosening re-
strictions on their clothing -‘- a

Dominican brother gave his friend '

Dan Goggin a mannequin outﬁtted
with an old, traditional nun’s habit.
Itwas afantastic conversation piece,
and eventually inspired him to cre-
ate the original line of “Nunsense”
greeting cards, which features nuns
in full habit alongside sayings like,
“Have Ruler, Will Travel.”

- The greeting cards were so
popular that they prompted Gog-

gin, an aspiring performer, to write. .

the “Nunsense” musical — a play
centered around the ﬁve surviving
Little Sisters of Hoboken’s attempts
at putting on avariety show to raise
money forthe burial offour departed

comrades, whom the convent cook
accidentally poisoned.

Goggin, who directed the current
performance at the Pittsburgh CLO
Cabaret, was raised Catholic, and
the ﬁve women featured in “Nun— A
sense” are based on ﬁve nuns who
taught him while he was at Catholic
school. .

“There are three of them still liv-
ing and they considertthemselves ~
huge stars,” Goggin said, citing Sister
Mary Ellen Walenta in particular,
the inspiration for smart—mouthed
Brooklyn nun Sister Robert Anne.
Walenta was unavailable for com-
ment. “It’s very cute,” Goggin said.

Despite its surprisingly dark
premise, Goggin said Catholics’
take issue with “Nunsense” very,
very rarely.

“The nuns are our biggest fans!

I think the reason is, it’s all zany
comedy; it has nothing to do  "T
religion. It’s really more of a farce ”
than a satire. I’ve had people tell me,
‘You know, you really could have put
a couple of zingers in there,’ but we
just wanted to make people laugh,”
he said. “I think there’s certainly a
place for theater like that, that ques-
tions things and makes you think,
but that just wasn’t our goal.”

Whereas St. Paul Cathedral de-
clined to -comment on whether or

Courtesy Matt Polk

not they found the play offensive,

both Goggin and musical director

Deana Muro insist that there are al-

ways nuns in the show’s audience.

Muro suggested that nuns are not
as unviable a source of zany comedy
as one might expect.

“Certainly if you’re Catholic, but
even if you’re not, there’s something
very mysterious and ﬁin about a
nun,” Muro said.

Christy Rodibaugh, who plays

‘ Sister Hubert, agreed.

“Most ofthe humor comes from
the fact that we’re doing things that
you don’t necessarily expect nuns to
do. Even normal, everyday ordinary
things  but you see someone in a
full habit doing it, and that’s what
makes it funny,” Rodibaugh said.

Although the church itself,
which advocates traditional family
values and does not allow women
to be ordained as pastors, has been

' criticized as being male-dominated,

feminists will be happy to hear that

“Nunsense” provides ﬁve fantastic 1

roles for women —— particularly
older women.

“We’ve had a lot of stars do the
shows, and they always say, ‘It’s just
wonderful that it doesn’t matter how
old I get — I can still be a nun!”’ Gog-
gin laughed. “And they don’t have to
look pretty that day.” I

 

CD REVIEW

‘Cries’ echoes goth pioneers

Patrick Wagner

Esben and the Witch

shees hasn’t put out an album in
15 years, its musical legacy lives on
in the post—post—post-punk era. Es-
ben and the Witch’s debut album,
Violet Cries, seems to channel its
complex, melodic rhythms along-
side a bevy of other diverse gothic
inﬂuences.

Pervading the UK’s band’s LP
are wispy, soul—inspired vocals fa-
miliar to fans of the xx that ﬂoat
above psychedelic guitarwork
reminiscent of The Black Angels,
with occasional hints of Joy Divi-
sion’s mechanical dirges. However,
with the addition of electronic
undertones and some impressive

CD REVIEW

drum and cymbal work, it’s hard,
to think of another band with this
same sound.

Though it recalls quite a few
ﬁgures in the history of dark mu-
sic as inﬂuences, Esben and the
Witch never quite ventures into
the realm of imitation. “Marching
Song” comeslacross as a spaced-
out punk-rock attack, while other
tracks like “Eumenides” move be-
tween heavy electronics and more
of those Siouxsie-styled vocal and
drum breaks. .3,

Though each song is a wonder-
ful collage of dark rock ’n’ roll,
there’s a general lack of cohesion
that keeps Violet Cries from ris-
ing above the indie—rock pack and
truly establishing itself as a genre-
deﬁning album. I’m holding out for
future releases, but if you have any
interest in the above artists, Esben
and the Witch’s current album is
deﬁnitely worth checking out. 

Sea Power releases soggy LP

Sara Pecora

Staff Writer
British Sea‘ Power
Valhalla Dancehall
- Rough Trade

Rocks Like: Mclusky, Maximo
Park, Franz Ferdinand
Grade: B-

F The first thing you’ll notice about
Valhalla Dancehall — the latest

album from UK post-punk band
British Sea Power — is how noisy it
is. Throughout the 13—track LP, the
vocals are swallowed up by a rush-
ing blast of instruments, crashing
and breaking like waves against
rock. It’s harsh and annoying and
makes the album hard to enjoy.
Disregarding the skewed in-
strumental-vocal ratio, Valhalla
Dancehall is, at its best, merely
decent. Quieter songs like “Geor-
gie Ray” and “Luna” are where the
band truly shines. “Georgie Ray” is

very Franz Ferdinand, like a little '

less bouncy “Dark of the Matinee,”

with a bit of Bowie mixed in for
good measure, whereas “Luna”
is dreamier. “Cleaning Out the
Rooms” is not as good as the
other two subdued numbers, bu?
features a redeeming violin—and—
drum—backed track.

The rest of the songs are pretty
stock indie/post-punk and could
be churned out by any other hip
indie-‘rock outﬁt. “Who’s in Con-_,
trol,” for example, is a politically
charged song but sounds more like
a party anthem, with the dubious
bonus of a car screech during the
bridge. “Thin Black Sail” is argu-
ably the worst track — although
a bit more original than the other
loud songs, it’s manic and screechy
and feels rushed.

In short, I’d recommend check-
ing out only the quiet songs and
simply tolerating the rest when
they’re in the soundtrack of some
pseudo-indie ﬁlm in which Michael‘
Cera plays George Michael with a
different name for the billionth
time. I

‘Panthers set to take on struggIingDePa_IuIf

Roger Sepich
Staﬂ" Writer

The distance between the No. 4 Pitt men’s
basketball team and DePaul couldn’t be any

' greater as they prepare to clash on Satur-
day. ‘

When the teams meet at 4 p.m. in Chi-

cago, the Panthers (18-1, 6-0 Big East) will
sit at ﬁrst place in the conference standings
as the Big East’s only undefeated team. The
Panthers ‘are coming off a 74-66 win over
top-ﬁve team Syracuse.
 On the other hand, the last place Blue
Demons (6-12, 0-6 Big East) have lost
19-straight Big East matchups dating back
to last season and were the victims of a
30-point loss at Marquette in their most
recent outing.

Brad Wanamaker:

(

a great team,” Wanamaker said.

The Panthers were forced to practice
Thursday without head coach Jamie Dix-
on, who stayed home because of an illness.
Dixon’s absence did little to stop the seniors
from making sure the team wentthrough
a difficult practice in preparation for De-
Paul. .

“We’re a focused team,” Wanamaker said.

“As seniors, Gary [McGhee], Gil [Brown] and _

myself know as we go, the team goes, and we
made sure we had a hard practice.”

In Pitt’s victory over Syracuse, the Pan-
thers not only showcased their experience,
but also their scoring balance. Nasir Robin.-
son, who entered: the game averaging just
over seven points, led Pitt with 21 points and
scored the game’s ﬁrst nine points.

“He’s really effective when he waits and
lets his teammates get him the shots,” Dixon

  i ggtait to go mat with

 
 

 

,«_J"‘.?’.:  egavww  rd", #5: "
 .  at l-31>.»/.- ‘it 

“It’s real tough. We can’t hang our heads,”
DePaul freshman guard Brandon Young said
after the Marquette game. “You got to go to
practice every day, work hard, keep moving
forward. It’s going to pay off. We’re going to
get that Big East win.”

Despite its record and current six-game
losing streak, DePaul does have a few rea-
sons to be optimistic. Young is averaging 12
points per game in his ﬁrst collegiate sea-

‘ ‘son and fellow freshman forward Cleveland
Melvin has posted 20 or more points in six
of his last seven games.

“Cleveland’s probably their best player,”
Pitt guard Ashton Gibbs said in a press con-
ference. “He scores a lot and he plays with

 a lot of energy.”

Sophomore Tony Freeland joins Young
and Melvin in averaging double ﬁgures with
11.2 points per game. The forward also adds
4.8 rebounds.

Although DePaul boasts some of the con-
ference’s best young players, the Panthers

/' "enter Saturday’s contest conﬁdent that their
experience can help them steer clear of the
upset. _

Pitt’s roster is laden with veterans, as
the Panthers start three seniors and two
juniors. Senior Brad Wanamaker said the

 team takes pride in playing like an experi-
enced squad.
“We know we’ve got to go out with the
same mindset and play like every game is a
game to get better and work towards being

  iamatéiset anti g}l.;t§7' like
    25%. gaggaaaae to get iaetéjer

said after the game.

Wanamaker also praised the Robinson’s
gameplay and McGhee’s 13-rebound per-
formance. .

“Any time they play well is a plus for our
team,” he said. “They are both great players
for this program and for us to be good, we
need our big men to contribute on the of-
fensive end. That’s what they’ve been doing
lately and that’s why we’ve been winning.”

The Blue Demons will have their hands
full with the Pitt frontcourt as DePaul aver-
ages 32 rebounds a game to Pitt’s 43. The
Panthers are second in the nation in re-
bounding.

If Pitt continues its solid start in Big East
play with a win, Saturday’s game against
DePaul could prove to be a record-setting
day for the Panthers.

Not only will a win extend Pitt’s school-
record start to aBig East campaign by im-
proving to 7-0 in the league, but junior guard

Gibbs will also have the chance to become l

the 38th Panther in school history to surpass
the coveted 1,000 career point mark as he
currently sits on 989.

“It’s not a" big thing to me,” Gibbs said ’

of the potential accomplishment. “But at
the same time, it’s a team thing. If you do

well as a team, individual goals take care of M

themselves.”
Wanamaker and Brown are also ap-
proaching 1,000 career points with 936

and 877 points, respectively. n

game, and Pitt tore apart the Orange’s

to start the game and ﬁnishing with al-
most 15 points above Syracuse’s average

_2_. Kemba Walker — Walker backed

I up his argument for best player in the

country with his performance against
Villanova. He actually finished with his
worstshooting game of the country, but

like all great players found the ball in his _

hands at the end of the game, when he

1. Syracuse -— Yes, the Orange lost
their undefeated season and dropped
into second place in the Big East with

their defeat at the hands of the Panthers. .

However, Syracuse went into the Oakland
Zoo, got down 19 points early and fought
back into the game without its leading
scorer. That can’t be held against the
Orange.

2. West Virginia — The Mountaineers
have been consistently inconsistent this
year. They won a big nonconference game
against No. 8-ranked Purdue only to drop
a— disappointing one to unranked Marshall
two days later. '

Power Rankings

Pittsburgh Panthers — The Panthers
are looking to do something the foot;
ball team couldn’t — make good on the“
preseason Big East Championship pre-
diction. _

Syracuse Orange — The Orange played
defense very unlike themselves on Mon-
day, but you better believe that Coachjim —
Boeheim won’t allow his team to make the
same mistakes against ’Nova.

Connecticut Huskies — Kemba Walker
did what Kemba Walker has consistently
done: make big shots. But he didn’t do it
alone.Jeremy Lamb scored twice his sea-
son average (14 points) and recorded sea;__
son highs in rebounds (eight) and 3-point
field goal percentage (40 percent).

Villanova Wildcats —. The Wildcats
shouldn’t hang their heads after the loss
to UConn. They’re still 16-2 and 4-1 in the
conference (1.5 games back) with games

against the likes of Syracuse and Pitt left -

on their schedule.

Louisville Cardinals —— The Cards have
pretty much won the games they were’
supposed to win and lost the games they
were supposed to lose this year. They have
a big matchup against WVU this week and.
then travel to UConn next Saturday.

West Virginia Mountaineers ~ The
Mountaineers jump onto my list with
their big win over No. 8 Purdue — then
promptly almost fell back off itwith
their loss to Marshall. Coach Bob Hug-
gins needs to get his team back to playing’
at a consistent level if it wants to come
anywhere close to repeating last year’s
performance.

Marquette Golden Eagles — Mar-
quette lost a heartbreaker Saturday to
Louisville but will get many more upset»
chances with Notre Dame (which it re-
cently beat), UConn, Syracuse and ’Nova
in consecutive games.

Notre Dame Fighting Irish — The Irish

~ Are You :3. Customer of
' Susquehanna Bank or First» Commonwealth Bank?

According to recent news reports, Susquehanna Bank and First Commonwealth
Bank allegedly reorder their customers’ withdrawais at the end of each‘ day from larg-
est to smallest so that their customers incur potentially unnecessary overdraft fees. By
manipulating the actuai sequence of the transactions, and processing debit and check
transactions from the largest amount to the smallest amount, Susquehanna and First
Commonwealth may cause their customers to incur axﬁﬁcial overdraft charges. In
several lawsuits around the country, the courts have found other banking institutions
liébie to their customers for engaging in those same sorts of activities.

' e we cannot guarantee the same result in this case, The Law Office of Scott M.
Hare and Levetown &jenkins, LLP are conducting an investigationmto possible
violations of state and fedora} consumer protection law by Susquehanna Bank and;

First Commonwealth Bank regarding this matter.

E f you are a customer of Susquehanna or First Commonwealth, or any other bank
2 - d may have been charged excessive and unwarranted overdraft fees, and if you wish to
obtain additiooai informationabout your rights, please contact Thea Boumazian at
