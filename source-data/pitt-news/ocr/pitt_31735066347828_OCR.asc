To Provide Discounts

By DEANNA LOUISE

The night-school newspaper

may be without an editor for at
least one year, since
proposals that would have given
the Night Times autonomy from its
roommate, the School of General
Studies Student Cabinet Council,
were rejected by that body Tuesday
night.
. Rejected were sections outlining
the direct working relationship
‘and the
newspaper, ‘procedures for the
editor’s impeachment and provi-
sions for the distribution of ad
revenue to pay staff members.

Nyden Signs
Contract

Under Protest

Assistant Sociology professor

Paul Nyden accepted with reserva-
tion the 15-month contract exten-
sion offered him by Chancellor
Wesley Posvar. -
_ The offer came as a compromise
following a decision by a specially
convened University Senate Panel
ﬁnding Nyden the victim of a
procedural defect in his tenure
review and a sociology department
reaction to the Panel’s decision
indicating no interest in working
with Nyden over the next three
years. ,

In a letter of acceptance and
protest, Nyden charged Posvar with
confusing collegiality with con-
formity, thus falsely implying
wrongdoing on his part.

This, and other excerpts from
Nyden’s letter can be found on page
three.

Night Times editors Dan Kohut

A one-alarm fire of an

to 210 North Belleﬁeld Ave.» last
night. The brick structure
sustained $2,000 in damages and

None of the 17 occupants of the
building were hurt. All were
relatives of Dr.‘ Sang Lephuoc, a

since the cabinet did not appoint an
editor by the April 30 deadline
established in the by-laws.

A legal interpretation. of the
by-laws has been requested of
campus judicial system coordinator
Alden Bowen to determine if a new
editor can be appointed after that
date. Three applications have,
already been received for the
position.

Yesterday cabinet President
John Della Valle said the council
agreed the proposals did not reflect
the intentions of the Night Times
representatives. Throughout the
meeting Podurgiel and Kohut

Buying Power Cards allowing
student discounts at 14 area
businesses will be made available in
limited quantities to Pitt under-
graduates beginning next Monday.

When shown with a Pitt ID, the
cards will provide discounts aver-
aging 10 percent at a variety of
establishments, principally in the
Oakland and Shadyside areas,
Student Government Board Presi-
dent Bernie Payne said Tuesday.
The cards, which are free, will .be
distributed on a ﬁrst-come, first-

Finance Joe Dutton said last night.
“I remember renting to a Korean
doctor who was having a severe
housing problem on a month-to-
month basis. We rented to him, his
wife, and two or three children. I
believe it was only for a few
months. I may be talking about an
entirely different property, though.

“We did have a residence on N.
Belleﬁeld Ave. that "was not
allowable for fraternity use due to
occupancy limits. We had to
remove a fraternity from that
property as they exceeded these
occupancy limits.” . 1

In response to the statements
made by Lally, Dutton said, “We
may have been given a warning,
but if it was condemned, we would
not rent it for occupancy. The
University does not occupy con-
demned property.”

school in the spring and summer

— seesions, probably at the Outdoor

Cafe or in the SGB ofﬁces, and we'll
make a limited number available for
people coming for orientation. The
bulk of the cards will be distributed
during fall registration. We don't
expect them to last longer than the
ﬁrst week of registration.”

Payne said he hopes the card will ,-

help students establish a better

‘rapport with the participating

merchants.

“The people listed on the back of
the cards have shown a sincere
interest in making the discount
work. They’re hoping, as we are, it
will catch on, so we're urging the
students to go see these establish-
merits.” Payne stated. '

Payne expressed disappointment
that more area businesses aren’t
participating in the discounts since
Pitt students are steady consumers
in the Oakland area. “I think we
have to question how some of the

stores which aren’t in on this '

discount view the students, since
both beneﬁt from it,” Payne said.

Although some of the discounts
are more practical than others,
Payne expressed enthusiasm for the
card, and said it is one way SGB can
be a more service-oriented student
government. '

“The card doesn’t give you a real
big discount,” Payne said. “10
percent isn't a whole lot, but if you
go into a store once a week for 52
weeks, that adds up to a lot of
savings over a year.”

Payne also said it is possible the
discount program, which will run
for at least‘ a year, could be
expanded to include more area
businesses. '

Morijuono Decriminolizotion Bill In Committee,

By MARY S. HUZINEC

A bill to decriminalize marijuana ’

in Pennsylvania, proposing a
maximum $50 civil citation for
possession of 30 grams of marijuana
or eight grams of hashish, has
recently been referred to the State
House Judiciary Committee.

The proposal, House Bill 904,
is sponsored by Representatives
Joseph Rhodes (D-Pittsburgh),
Norman Berson (D-Philadelphia),
Anthony Sirica (R-Montgomery
County) and John White, Jr.
(D-Phildelphia).

According to the National Organ-

ization for the Reform of Marijuana »

Laws (NORML), a previous propos-
al establishing a maximum $100
civil fine for the same deﬁnition of
offenses was effectively killed by
the House Health and Welfare
Committee.

“Voting on Bill 904 is presently

up in the air because of the current ‘

state budget crisis,” said Mark

Volavka, Rep. Rhodes’ administra-
tive assistant.

According to Volavka, the
Judiciary Committee will be
concentrating on this budget crisis
through July and will then recess for
two months.

‘ ‘The earliest the bill can be voted
on is September or October,”
Volavka said.

Last year Rep. Rhodes co-spon-
sored a similar bill with Rep. Berson
to decriminalize marijuana, but it
never reached the ﬂoor for a ﬁnal
vote, he said.

Volavka thinks the passage of
House Bill 904 will be a tough ﬁght
because the representatives who
didn’t want to see the bill passed
last year will refer it back to another
committee.

Decriminialization of the posses-
sion of small amounts of marijuana,
usually an ounce or less, is not the
same as full legalization of the
drug-—a much more drastic meas-

ure than even many avid propo-
nents of pot advocate.

Eight states have changed their
laws and no longer treat possession
of marijuana as a criminal act.
Oregon, Alaska, Maine, Colorado,

California, Ohio, South Dakota and 2

Minnesota provide for traffic
ticket-like citations and small fines
instead of arrests and jail sen-
tences.

Under present Pennsylvania law,
possesion of marijuana is a
misdemeanor, but possession with
intent to distribute and sell the drug
is a felony carrying a sentence of up

to ﬁve years in jail and as much as a 1

$15,000 ﬁne.

According to NORML, removal of '

all criminal penalties for the private
possession and use of marijuana has
been endorsed or recommended by
President Jimmy Carter, the
National Commission of Marijuana
and Drug Abuse, the American Bar
Association, the American Public

HE’S FLUNKING HALF
THE CLASS

CHICAGO (AP)—-A Chicago
school superintendent, upset that
many of his eighth-grade pupils
couldn’t read better than a
sixth~grade level, has decided to
keep more than half the students in
eighth grade again next year.

“When I took a look at the
reading scores,” said Albert A.
Briggs, “I blew my top.”

Briggs, superintendent of School
District 9, said Wednesday that 678
of the 1,289 eighth graders in 16
schools in the predominantly black
district failed to score a minimum
6.5 on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills.

Officials said the national norm at
the end of the eighth grade is 9.8 on
the standard reading test. Last year
the average for eighth graders
throughout Chicago was 6.8.

Briggs said there had been

almost no adverse reaction from
parents in his district, which
includes many poor inner-city
neighborhoods, because the read-
ing problem had been recognized
more than a year ago. ,

Briggs said that in March 1975 he
set 6.5 as a cutoff mark for
graduation after examining reading
levels at Crane High School, where
most of District 9’s pupils attend.
The 6.5 level is roughly the
equivalent of reading comprehen-
sion expected in the middle of the
sixth grade.

He said he was shocked to ﬁnd
that none could read at the high
school freshman level and only 18
per cent had scores at the
seventh-and eighth-grade levels.
He said many pupils could not read
well enough to function in daily life.

For the Class of ’78, it’s going to
be tougher, Briggs said. He is
raising the reading comprehension
standard to 7.0.

Marijuana Proposal

In House Committee

Health Association and Ann
Landers, among other nationally
respected organizations and per-
sonalities. I

Ken Adami, research analyst for
the House Judiciary Committee
thinks marijuana decriminalization
is basically a political issue. I

“No matter how strong the
arguments are in favor of decrim-
inalizing marijuana, the represent-
atives will vote according to how the
majority of their constituents would
want them to vote,” Adami said.

Currently, 33 states are consider-
ing legislation to ease marijuana
penalties. By 1976, NORML has

predicted half of the United States
will have decriminalized pot.

Within the next few years,

NORML officials expect the battle 

will shift to legalization, in which
marijuana would be regulated like
alcohol, and age, strength and.
quality ‘controls could be imposed.

FORCIBLE RAPE UP
4.9 PERCENT LAST YEAR

HARRISBURG ,(AP)——Forci-
ble rape increased in Pennsylvania
last year, the only violent crime that
went up, according to an annual
state police report.

A total of 2,156 forcible rapes, an
average of six each day, were
reported to police in 1976.

Police said they were able to
make arrests in 66 per cent of all
rape cases.

The total number of crimes
committed increased just over one
per cent in 1976 but violent crime
dropped 10.5 per cent, the report
said.

Text of Nyden's   Letter

Accepting Contract

Dear Chancellor Posvar,

I am writing to accept your offer
of May 12, 1977 of a new contract to
run between May 1, 1977 and
August 31, 1978. I am also writing
to express my disagreement with
both your May 12 letters to me and
to the faculty; a copy of the latter
was never sent to me by you. I have
many questions as to the details of
your offer, and before they are
implemented, I request a meeting
with you and a full examination of
these details by the University

‘ Senate Committee on Tenure and

Academic Freedom. I emphasize
that I am not rejecting your offer; I
am accepting it with requests for
clarification and with serious
reservations. I had hoped you
would not set the speciﬁc terms of
my contract until the full transcript
of the Hearing Board’s proceedings
was available and reviewed‘ by you.
I request that a copy be given to me
at the earliest possible time, and
that a second copy be .provided to
the TAF Committee... ’ _ 1
Your numerous references to
“Collegiality” and “Mutual civility
have a chilling and deterring effect
upon the free exercise of my own
First Amendment rights and those
of other professors. The right to
express oneself freely takes prece-
dence over your apparent definition
of “collegiality.” The expectation
of due process-——which I was so
ﬂagrantly -denied throughout the

past 15 months—also takes prece-
dence over “collegiality.” I value
collegiality and will continue to
remain friendly to all my colle-
aguesp. It should be remembered
that even the secret Special Review
Committee—-1975 report described
me on page 5 as “in no way...being
a grim, forbidding or uncommuni-
cative personality—-on the con-
trary.” The transcript of your
Board’s hearings, however, is
replete with uncollegial statements
by some of my colleagues. In all
fairness, you should review this
transcript before drawing public
conclusions about collegiality with-
in the Sociology Department.

I fear that by collegiality you
might really mean conformity.
Indeed, I would like a clariﬁcation of
your definition of collegiality. You
imply that I have done something
improper, but you offer no speciﬁcs.
Please detail such speciﬁcs, for I
regard your allegations in this

regard most seriously. Could you

also refer me to relevant university
documents? The first notice I had of
this issue was the document of
October 28, 1976--sent to me by
Dean Rosenberg, Provost Smith,
and yourself-—which I learned on
April 28, 1977 (subsequent to
unanswered inquiries as to its
origin) was not an official document
at all, but merely a memorandum

L (Continued on Page 4)

A total of 794,908 crimes were
reported during 1976, compared to
785,758 in 1975.

Forcible rape was up 4.9 per cent.

Murders were down 10.3 per cent
and aggravated assaults down 3.1
per cent.

Larceny-thefts were up 8.1 per
cent while robberies were down
18.1 per cent, burglaries down 6.9
per cent and motor vehicle thefts
down 4.4 per cent.

Most of the 399,954 persons
arrested last year, 70.6 per cent,
were under 25 years old.

Males make up 86 per cent of
those arrested. Sixty-eight per cent
of the persons arrested are white
and 30.5 per cent black.

I "7 I Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

   

D‘ A Question of Freedom

The ongoing battle between the evening co11ege’s two major
student organizations—the Student Cabinet Council and the Night
Times—is an unfortunate one whose outcome will be important to
every General Studies student.

The fighting seems to center around this point:_ Night Times
editors want more control of the publication’s editorial content,

and Cabinet members are reluctant to relinquish that authority.

To be sure, the Night Times has had its problems and, given its

I resources and competition, will continue to have them. But that is

no excuse for the Cabinet’s refusal to extend freedoms enjoyed by
_any newspaper worth the 29-pound I1€WSPTiI1t On Which it is Prin-
ted. -
Time seems to be on the Cabinet’s side, since the newspaper’s
supporters will eventually have to surrender, leaving night students
with either no newspaper, or, worse, a publicity rag published by the

Council (as was the case several months ago). Either way, evening .

students will be the group suffering the most losses in the fight.

I But this does not mean the Night Times advocates should end
their story and leave their readers without a ‘newspaper of their
own. It is important that they continue to dodge by-law

I - bureaucracy and strive to establish editorial freedom on the

Cathedral’s third floor. If the Cabinet is as wise as students should
expect their representatives to be, the Night Times will receive
editorial freedom,.and soon. .

Any organization that seeks to squelch honest reporting of its ac-

’ tivities immediately becomes suspect to us. And this, apparently, is

just ‘what the cabinet is trying to do. After refusing a proposal for
an elected editor, we can expect the Cabinet to appoint its

own-—it already has asked legal opinion on its ability to do just

that-_—and have publicity releases distributed under the Night Times
flag.

The Night Times has problems—it must share an office with the
Cabinet, its staff of skilled workers is not large——but none like it
would have should the by-law revisions proposed recently be rejec-

\ ted. And, we suspect, that would be the beginning of a great deal

of problems for the Cabinet, also.

Letters to the Editor

Conclusion of N yden Letter Excerpts

(Continued from Page 3)

co-authored by Associate Provost
David Powers and university
attorney Keith Burr, a document
which seems to bear a close
resemblance to-a bill of attainder.
I welcome any fair evaluation of
my scholarship in the future. But I
hope it will be conducted equitably;

, the potential defects" in the
proposed procedures outlined in ~

your letter should be rectified. ,1
also assume that this new review

will be a perfunctory one, as reviews -

for others in a similar position have
been. In the proposed 1978 review,
I do not want standards more

appropriate for tenure to be applied
again, unless .the customery
practice within the university is
changed for everyone...

Your offer has tarnished the
name of the University. You
suspend customery rules and norms
in my case. You attempt to silence
my own voice and those of other
professors. You seem to place
“collegiality’ ’ above academic free-
dom and due process. After I have
won my appeal, you attempt to
humiliate me and threaten me
publicly. I hope that my conclusions
based on your May 12 letters are
premature, and will be proven

incorrect in future meetings with
you...

In signing your contact offer
today, I am reminded of the
“yellow-dog” contracts which the
companies forced coal miners to
sign in the days before they
established their union. .As a
condition of their employment, they
had to sign their rights away. I am
signing your contract offer under
sharp protest, and I have no
intention of relinquishing any of my
rights.

Philomena hung up -the phone,

that she was quitting and going

with the following idea.

the $1,000 per month for life lottery.
Here’s how we’re going to do it.
We’re going to liquidate all our
assets, take the money and buy as

many “Bingo” lottery tickets as we
can. For once in our lives we’re
going to shoot the works. If we
loose, we’re young enough to start
over, but at least we’ll have shot the

Do you believe that anybody
would spend everything at roughly
1,700 to 1 odds? Well, the Drakes
are doing .just that. I met Tom and
Philomena last Tuesday at South
Hills Village when I was walking by
the state lottery booth. I noticed

them scraping away at a stack of S00
“Bingo” tickets, I walked over and
asked if they really had purchased
$500 worth of tickets. Sure enough,

they had.

Tom told me he was going to win

the “big one” or go bust doing it. ’

He stated that they were getting a
great, deal

passersby and friends. One man
gave them a ticket for a chance on
the million dollar lottery. Tom
estimates that they have approxi-
mately $20,000 and hope it will turn

into a million via the lottery. “Once
in our ‘life we’re going to do
something before we get old. Even
if we lose we will have gained
something; we’re closer because of

create extra confusion for already

Preprogrammed functions (sine,
cosine, log) are an important part of
the calculator keyboard. The
functions should be placed on keys
near or at the same key positions as
their inverse functions.

Another important keyboard part
is tactile feedback: a clicking sound
in the keys which informs the
operator the key has been
sufficiently depressed.

Today’s calculators have three

display types: the light-emitting

diode (LED), the liquid crystal

display (LCD) and ﬂuorescent. The
LED displays are usually small

glow bright red. The new LCD

Uriah Heep Has Never Sounded Better

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Veteran British‘ rockers Uriah
Heep have always had a way of
freaking out crowds with their loud,
and at times, raucous brand of
shotgun rock ’n’ roll and their
mystical, heavy-metal fantasy
pieces.
Such was the case last Thursday
night at the steaming Stanley
Theater. The enthusiastic crowd
just didn’t want to see and hear the
band, they absolutely craved them.
“I guess we do like to ﬂash about
onstage and off, freaking people
out,” said burly, happy-go-lucky
drummer Lee Kerslake. “Al-
though we might have slipped a bit
commercially in the last few years,
the response we got tonight is proof
that we’re definitely comin’ on
again.”

49" V

 

-All the members of the band

   
 

were ecstatic after their perform-
ance Thursday night. And they
had every reason to be.

After the band finished their
blitzkrieg encore of “Gypsy” and
“Sweet Lorraine,” the crowd
would just not go home. Police and
roadies had the unenviable task of
saying, “That’s all, folks.”

Everything worked right for
Uriah Heep. New lead singer John
Lawton is a much more persuasive
stage ﬁgure and a more powerful
singer than the inconsistent David
Byron.

“We sacked Byron because he
got too involved with the perks of
the rock ’n’ roll business,” said
another Heep live wire, guitarist

‘ Mick Box. “You know something’s

wrong when your singer gets more
involved with limousine rides and
how many buckets of champagne
there are instead of the basic

z‘

‘Uriah Heep is back on the right track with their music, as witnessed by a raving
crowd at the Stanley Theatre last week.

element of any band-mllSiC-”

The Heep hit the stage with all
five members dressed to the hilt.
Lawton looked like the devil
incarnate with his black eye
shadow, feather earrings, laced-up
shirt and wide leather belt.

Keyboardist/guitarist Ken
Hensley just might have the
longest hair in rock ’n’ roll, and his
knee-high white platform boots
were quite eye-catching.

Kerslake had on a purple satin
outfit and thigh-high alligator
boots. New bassist Trevor Bolder,
formerly with David Bowie’s
Spiders From Mars group, has his
hair spiked like Rod Stewart.

’ Box, who will never win a Peter
Frampton look-alike contest,
sported green satin pants a colorful
striped vest.

“You’d be a fool not to
acknowledge image as a part of any
rock ’n’ roll band,” said Box.
“And if we come on flashy, I guess
that’s just the way we are. And
that’s what people expect.”

The band mixed new songs from
the “Firefly” album with many old
favorites.

“Do You Know," “Stealin’,”
and “Look at Yourself” were of the
hard-hitting variety. “Firefly,”
“The Wizard,” and “July Morn-

 

ing” were a little softer, and
showed the Heep’s ability to play
heavy progressive rock ’n’ roll
music one minute, and switch to a
beautiful melody line the next. ,
“Sympathy” and Kerslake’s
‘.‘Who Needs Me,” both from the
new album, were two of the
best-received tunes of the night.
“ ‘Who Needs Me’ deals with a
basic human situation—-when a
person is bummed out because he
thinks he has no value,” said
Kerslake. “I’ve been that way
myself, andvI’m sure everybody
has. It's a loud, fast boogie song
that tries to get a lighthearted
message of hope through—-things
will get better.”
On “Easy Livin’,” the Heep’s

.most ‘popular song,_ Kerslake

jumped on his drums and tossed
his sticks to a crowd that was inside
out with ecstasy. 3

Uriah Heep has never sounded
better. Box’s guitar had the old
bite and Hensley played his
keyboards with renewed gusto.
The addition of Lawton and Bolder
seems to have sparked this
once-great band back on_ rockin’
course. I

“I’ve never felt more comfort-
able with a band or had more fun
on the road than with these guys,”

By DAVE MC DONALD

BLOOMINGTON, IND.-The Pan-

. tlier tracksters ended their 1977
outdoor track season on a sour note ,

this past weekend at the Central
Collegiate Conference meet at the
Unviersity of Indiana. Pitt only
mustered nine points against tough
competition during the three-day
meet.

Panther standouts included Dan
Goodyear, who only cleared 6-10 in
the high jump, but made it good for
third place. In the decathlon, the
event Bruce Jenner made famous,
Mike Sapienza placed sixth,
scoring 5,595 points for the 10
events.

Surprise team winner in the
Ceiitrals was Southern Illinois, with

1 Competitor for

Penn State the runner--up.
Southern Illinois got their strength
from good jumpers and PSU was
boosted to second place with the
depth of their distance members.
Michigan, thought to be a strong
the team title,
finished way down the line because

-their distance team peaked during

the indoor season. The disap-
pointed distance contingent from
Michigan quit for the remaining
meets following their poor showing
at the Big Ten meet.

The Panthers ran into some of
the same problems as the

Wolverines, being “burned out,”-

lacking depth, and having several
members quit the team.

“We definitely lacked communi-
cation this year,” head track

mentor Mike Agostinella ex-
plained. “We have already taken
measures to alleviate our pro-
blems, though. I hope we can
make a more open team, and have
a stronger team next year when the
end of the season rolls around.-”

The problem of being “burned
out" is particularly rampant for the
Panthers distance runners, whose
training season runs from July to
June. Mel Boyd, MVP from the
indoor season, ran his best 5,000
meter time of the year in the first
outdoor meet, but was unable to
touch that time in later contests.

“The past month l’ve felt burned
out,” Boyd explained. “The
season is just too long.”

A solution to the problem of a
long season, suggested by Panther

Portland Ties Six ers

PHILADELPHIA (AP)--The
National Basketball Association
championship series has become a
matter of 12 against one, and even
The Doctor can’t handle those odds.

The Portland Trail Blazers, their
fast break running like a well-oiled
machine, got points from all 12 men
on their roster as they routed the

Phildelphia 76ers 130-98 Tuesday‘
night to even the best-of-seven

playoff ﬁnals at two victories

apiece.

3 Philadelphia, by contrast, got 24

points from Julius “Dr. J.” Erving
and little from anyone else. Erving
had 14 points in the second period to
keep the 76ers close, but was no
match for the Blazers’
41-point third quarter.
Are the 76ers, with George
McGinnis still in his woeful slump,
relying too heavily on Erving?
“No,” replied Portland Coach
Jack Ramsay. “Teams go to their
strength. It’s very reasonable.

Philadelphia goes to Erving just as

sizzling

Los Angeles goes to Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar. ’ ’

“You can never do too much,”
contended Erving. , “But it’s
depressing. When they triple-team
me, it should help us as a team. But
it hasn’t. Our offense went from
bad in Sunday’s 129-107 loss at
Portland to worse.”

The Blazers, meanwhile, re-
bounded from a woeful perfor-
mance in the second game of the
series here last Thursday with two
brilliant games on their home floor.

“We hadn’t played well, and we
had begun to wonder if we could
beat Philly,” said Portland guard
Lionel Hollins. “We were tight.
But after we won our ﬁrst game at
home, we started to realize we’ve
still got a good ball team.”

“On Sunday we ran very well,”
said reserve guard Dave Twardzik.
“On Tuesday we ran even better.”

Everybody got into the act for the
Blazers.

“Portland was super, absolutely

super,” said Philadelphia Coach
Gene Shue. V “It didn’t matter who
they put in. All their players were
effective.” -

Which is the point Ramsay has
been making all along about the
Blazers, a young team which
includes seven players who weren’t
on the roster a year ago.

“We stress the team concept
above all else,” said Ramsay.

“We want everyone to be
involved. There’s nobody on this
team who doesn’t have a play
designed for him. They all have
contributed something to us.”

“Our game is to move the ball
and move ourselves and not look for
any one player,” said Portland’s
veteran reserve center-forward
Lloyd Neal, who ﬁlled in brilliantly
when Bill Walton got into foul
trouble Tuesday.

The teams ﬂew here from
Portland Wednesday and were
scheduled to practice on Thursday.

PHILADELPHIA (AP———John

Candelaria hurled a rain-shortened '

two-hit shutout Wednesday night
to give the Pittsburgh Pirates a 3-0
victory over the Philadelphia
Phillies. snapping the Pirates’
five-game losing streak. '
The game was called after seven
and one-half innings following a
second torrential downpour.
Candelaria, 7-1. gave up a
controversial hit in the second

inning to Jerry Martin and an
inﬁeld hit in the sixth to Dave

The improving performances of
freshman Gary Siriano may prove
this training technique. Siriano,
who was out of competition during
the indoor season with a leg injury,
ran only distance during the winter
months, and topped his training
efforts at the Centrals with a time
of 3:53 in the 1,500 (a 4:10

Siriano’s best time by five seconds
and he looked very strong at the

“It was a fast track but I felt
great,” Siriano said later.

Changes seem to be on the way
for Pitt’s track team next year. A
schedule change, different work-
outs, or freedom from athletic
heads to improve the track program
may be in the offing. Perhaps next
year’s team can prevent “burning
out” before the Conference meet.

PITT TRACKS-Junior
jumper Dan Goodyear is off to the
University of Illinois to compete in
the NCAAs. He is looking to better
his best mark of 7-], set at the Penn
State meet.

1 Basketball Coach Tim Grgurich

completed his 1977 recruiting today '

with the announcement that Dave
Olinger, a 6-5, 190-pound All-
Stater from West Lafayette, Ohio,
will enroll at Pitt this fall.

Olinger is Pitt’s fourth basketball
recruit——joining Sam Clancy, 6-6
center from Pittsburgh’s Brashear
High School; Terry Peavy, 6-4
guard form Pittsburgh’s Allegheny
Community College (CCAC); and
Gary Smith, 6-7 forward also from
CCAC.

Olinger, a guard, is an outstand-
ing shooter who captained his West
Lafayette Ridgewood High School
team to a 22-1 record this past
season. Hitting on 58 percent from
the field he averaged 26.9 points

per game and 14 rebounds, in
addition to leading the team in

1 steals.

He was named Ohio AA
player-of-the—year, AA first-team
All-State (both Associated Press
and United Press International),
All Intervalley Conference and
All-District Five. He was also
selected to play in the Ohio
North-South All-Star game June 11
in Columbus.

“Dave is an excellent shooter,
and a good all around player who
we feel will fit into our program
well,” Grgurich noted in making
the announcement. “He’ll be a big
guard and our experience with that
type of player (Keith Starr and Kirk
Bruce) has been excellent.”

Snaps Fi ve- Game Skid

Pittsburgh scored all three runs
off Phillies’ starter Larry Christen-
son after two outs in the first
inning. Christeson walked Dave
Parker and Al Oliver tripled him
home. .

Christenson then hit Bill Robin-
son with a pitch, the first of three
hit batsmen by therighthander.
Rennie Stennett singled, scoring
Oliver. and when shortstop Larry
Bowa booted Ed Ott’s grounder,
Robinson scored the final run.

The Phils had only one other
runner——-Christenson walking in
th third.

{pm AVIS.

The game was delayed for one
hour and nine minutes in the top of
the sixth and 48 minutes in the
Phillies’ eighth before it was
called.

Philadelphia's first hit started a
rhubarb. Left fielder Al Oliver
‘thought he had made a shoetop
catch of Martin's sinking drive, but
Umpire John Kibler said the ball
had been trapped. It was the Phils’
only hit until Johnson’s grounder
hit the third base bag for a hit in
the sixth.
