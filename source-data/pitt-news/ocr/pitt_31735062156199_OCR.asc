"News Blamed

At first glance this election ap-

regular" vote _to ﬁll a vacant posi-
tion in council. However, as _a re-
sultfof a column appearing in the
Pitt ‘Newstlast week which said
the members of council were

“playing politics,” many of the:

‘councilmen said they feel they are
being intimidated by the News
and have -expressed opposition to

the column, the author, and the .

subject.

Although most of the council-
men contacted wished to remain
anonymous, and others refused to
comment, two did speak in defense
of their organization and its poli-
cies. '

Ronald Ecker, president of MC,
said, “MC will not be intimidated
by Pitt. News reporters. We are;

deﬁnitely embittered by the fact"

that _a reporter would voice only
one "side"-"of 'a development. '

For Pep Rally Snafu’s
A ” By NANCY COOK ' ’
A post—mortem survey of the factors sabotaging successful
pep rallies at Pitt was presented in a written report on

Monday to Student Congress by Jay Garber, assemblies
chairman under‘ﬁre for allegedly botching his job.’

In his analysis of the rallyplans, results,

complaints

and faults, Garber showed what he:

believed to be the chief stumbling-

‘A :blocks in preparing the rallies.

’ Administrative veto proved the
jinx for the Iowa pre-game rally,
‘originally scheduled for a full hour
‘and which turned out to be a ten-
minute “warm-up,” according to

" Garber

Students Blariied Also
Student enthusiasm after the

‘Notre Dame upset ‘swept away the

plans for the celebration, said
Garber, as a mob started the rally

_at 9 a.m. instead of University-

sanctioned 10:30 a.m. Again "ad-
ministration-student conﬁict ap-
peared as ofﬁcia-ls would not per-
mit the‘ ‘band,_ cheerleaders or
Pantherto lead the student march
to other schools, Garber stated.

A pre-Army game rally ﬁzzled
as the Athletic Department re-

_ fused to allow the team to come

to school for a send-off, Garber
assertedgand the University re-
fused permission for a, Thursday
pep gathering.

The most thoroughly snarled sit-
uation appeared at the Homecom-
ing pre-game rally as only a few
students appeared to participate in
the night rally. Garber explained
that the expected roster of speak-

-‘ ers failed" to appear.

Publicity Defended
Garber countered the lack _of
publicity criticism, which was one
of the strongest charges against
him, with facts that campus and
downtown newspapers c a r r i e d
stories of the rally plans and three
thousand notices were distributed.
At the recent poorly-attended
Ohio State rally, which began
the ,attak against Garber’s rally
handling, all the previous trou-

In eighteen different buildings, -

including Mellon Institute, West-
ern Psychiatric Hospital and Falk

‘Clinic, are 740 telephones connect- P

ed to that board. Even when it is-
closed, about two rows of night

lines are open, through which calls M

can be directly transmitted.

The new intercommunications
system, installed in 1949, replaced
the old one, where the operator
had to service each call separately.

Today, in the building, calls are L

automatically connected anywhere
in the University simply by dialing
the extension number.

All calls pass ..througli the termi- .

nal, a highvoltage inclosure of ca-
bles and batteries and mazes of
multicolored wires, neatly coiled
into" bundles, resembling woven
baskets. ,
Each of these wires is attached

to a tiny metal piece, called a line '

relay band.
In case anything goes wrong in
the system, the terminal room is
- ﬁlled,with all kinds of testing ap-
paratus to ﬁnd the cause of the
trouble.

- The switchboard, too, is equip-
ped with a manual hand-ringing
button if the battery should fail.
But the only time this happened
was during the 1936 ﬂood, when

At English Room Dedication

. G.
Pitt’s English Room will be ded-

icated Friday, Nov. 21, at 8:30 p.m."
during ceremonies in the Com-
mons Room.

Alfred  ‘ Bossom, member of
Parliament and chairman of the
English Room in England, will be
the main speaker. Sir Christopher
"Eden Steel, minister from Britain
to the United States, will bring a
message from the British govern-
ment.

The English Room, according to
Albert Klimcheck of the Univer-
sity’s Architectural Service and de-
signer and interpreter of the Eng-
lish Room, is an example of in-
terior architecture during the time
of Shakespeare.

This Nationality Room contains
more of the old English House of
Commons than any other spot -in
the world, except'for the Church-

, illian arch‘ of the new House of

Commons.
Gifts to University _
Included in the English Room
are gifts from the English people

‘to the University. Among these‘

gifts are stone, wood—paneling and
the stone-arched ﬁreplace from the
bombed House of Commons.

All walls except the south wall
are ﬁnished. with rough sand plas-
ter. The south wall includes a ﬁre-
place from Aye Lobby, a black-
board, an entrance door and pan-

craftsmen invented.

On the north wall are two por-
traits, one of William Pitt and the
other of Andrew M. Mellon, Pitts-
burgh’ industrialist who was "am-
bassador to the court of Saint
James. A

The light ﬁxtures and all the

suggested a rally immediately after

the game. Others favored a Sat-
urday evening rally. It was also
sugges.ted that some type of rally
be held regardless ‘of victory or
defeat.
Worry About Rally

the possibility of a demonstration
inithe event of a victory. Presi-
dent Jack Burwinkel urged the
members to do all in their‘ power
to stop the migration of any spon-
taneous rallies to other campuses.

Lew McCullough, head of a spe-
cial committee to look into Tuck

prices were fair in light of the
diﬁiculties encountered in operat-
ing a food service here. ‘ ‘

A Food Service Discussed

After talking with Miss Ruth
Cramblet, head of the service, Mc-
Cullough said he was convinced
that the prices are just. Transpor-
tation diiﬁculties in moving food
and dishes help jack prices. A, half
pint of milk which the food serv-
ice buys for seven cents is sold for
twelve. The average sale in the
Tuck Shop is only 22' cents, and,
on the-average, only 40 complete
hot meals are served in the cafe-'
teria each day.

Dads’ Day also came up for dis-
cussion. Jack Burwinkel said that
Student Congress». had been uh-
justly criticized for a transporta-
tion mixup in getting fathers from
the luncheon to the game on Sat-
urday. According to Burwinkel,
“someone in a higher echelon
messed up.” The opinion of the
group was that prices for Dads’
Day are too high. More long range
planning was also suggested.

‘How Can We Cry?  . g , Q,
With so many frightening,‘vital things fgoing
on in the world around us today,’ how can we con-
tinually cry_ about lack of school spiritand pep?
When you stop and _think,about it, have we
anything seriously worth complaining about? Don’t
‘ the rally "enthusiasts realize‘ that there’s a time, and
place for»'everything including. wild‘ cheering and
' demonstrations and that the’ time for cheering
our boys on‘ to victoryis before and during the
‘- game and not two days later when the‘ rally merely
becomes the facsimileof a mutual_ admiration so-

little more populated instead of
resembling’ our friend Gypsy
Rose Lee at the half-way mark.
Every-Game A Sellout?
Another" argument of the Ath-
letic Committee stemmed from.
the fact that they could not allow
seats to be sold at ‘a reduced
price if therewas. a chance of
getting the full tariff. This would
be true for a sell-out game like
the coming Penn State affair ap-
pears to be. Anyone predicting
a sell-out for the _ game ~ with
North Carolina. must have been
thinking of.Soldiers and Sailors

. Memorial instead of the Stadium.

A poorly attended "game such» as
Saturday"s would be, an ideal
time, for students to bring their
wives and ‘sweethearts.

Planners must have been-
guilty "bf gross ‘over-optimism

. if ‘they, ﬁgured to‘ get more than

the 20,000 predicted for the

game. Still, the affair was inter-

esting and would: have proved
attractive to a lot "of wives who
have yet to see. their ﬁrst Pitt
home game. As long as Pitt con-
tinues to play North Carolina,

' Indiana, and’ Iowa, they are go-

ing to be faced with a lot of
empty seats come kickoff-time.-
Back To The Kiwi
Under-manned games would
permit the sale of reduced seats.
in the Student Section. Visitors.
would not disrupt the cheering

of_the students. There would not —
be a ﬁnancial loss. The Univer- A
" sity. could promote’ a good public

relations program. A lot of good
will would ensue from students
and friends. ' ' .

This thing still has possibilities
—'-or should, we go back to the
Kiwi bird. A little about Gypsy

‘ Rose ‘Lee, might not be so bad

either! . ~

In anumber ofrespects I feel
that the Pitt Newslhas gone from
bad to worse! Itﬁused tobe "that
my‘ main gripe was the paper’s
over-zealous eﬁorts to retain the
precious‘ All American_ Rating at
the expense of adequate c‘over-
age and publicity‘ of _all-school

’-eve‘nts,.while ‘at the same time
bemoaning poor school spirit in
- every third" issue.
_ But this year, it has committed
a crime far more severe, severe
at least, for an impartial, unbias-
ed “All-Student Newspaper."
Now,‘ some of the columnists‘
havedecided to devote‘ ‘as much
as thirty or forty column inches
to the promotion of some" one
‘campus politico. I am thinking
particularlyof the articles, “Joe
Shuler is Coming Up” and Pro-
gress or Patronage for MC.” .
, In the same,‘ issue that gives
Dad’s Day six inches,‘ there ap-
pears ﬁfteen column inchesin
support of Joe Trattner "for
Men’s Council. Any article“ in.
our school, paper that would
openly support one individual
for any office is bad enough. But,
‘to have t it appear in ‘an issue
where such ‘a potentially im-
portant event-as Dad’s Day is so
obviously slighted shows_ what
seems to be the ultimate in cam-
pus political machines.

The column in support of Joe
-made ' mention of the “Wecht
machinel’. May I. add, that to
my" knowledge, this “machine”
never had such amedium for
spreading ' political propaganda

as does thepresent group back- .

ing Joe Trattner. It is ‘quite ob-
vioustthat MERIT will not be
denied.   '

He lived and -was educated there‘

asked if he ‘received a “Greetings”

2 Traditional Yule Log

The dance this year is following
much the same policy of the sell-

yule logs will burn in the ﬁreplaces
in the Commons Room, adding
warmth “to the scene and giving it
a deﬁnite holiday air, said Piemme.

There will be ‘checking services

Red and the Blue Tuck Shops will
remain open for the convenience
of any "‘hungry’i’ dancers. This

In the 137-pound division, Peery
has George Matthews and Bill

improvement in practice.

Another runnerup in. the 4-1

Husky.John ‘Stock, an end from
Carnegie, is one of the few play-
ers who saw double duty for the

‘ Cubs this fall.

touchdown to start_ the Panthers 4

toward a 39-0 win over Bullis

blocked another kick which re-
sulted in a touchdown one play

In the ﬁrst game of the season

Experienced Gridders
Lost, After State Clash

By RUSS

FRANKE

Eleven senior gridders will wind up their collegiate grid
careers Saturday-—-unless, of ‘course, a post-season game is

forthcoming-—when Penn -State and the Panthers square off .

for the annual bloodletting.

Although only two of the departing Panthers are backs,
Billy Reynolds and Paul Chess, Reynolds’ loss leaves a large
‘hole in the ball-carrying department.

_ _ Guard position is being hit hard-¢
iest of all, though, with Merle De-

Luca, Tony Romantino, Al Smala-

  

 

Engle ,Arnelle
ra, and. Erancis Baron vacating,
four spots on the line.

Defense Will Suffer

Red Dawson’s defensive platoon,
too, will suffer immeasurably
without the services of crack line-
backer and captain of the team Joe
Schmidt and End Joe Bozek.
George Glagola, end and lineback-
er, also dons the Blue-and-Gold
for the last time.

The only two experienced cen-
ters on the squad, Stu Kline and
Gabe Gembarosky, are both sen-
iors, leaving the pivot position
very much depopulated.

The largest crowd of the season
is expected to attend the farewell
appearance.

Rados, Arnelle Hot

Besides the usual intrasectional
interest as a drawing power, added
interest stems from the assump-
tion that, should no bowl bid be
extended up until game time, such
a bid will hinge on the outcome.

The Panthers will be up for the
game and aware of the dangerous
-Nittany aerial oﬁense, which has

 

accounted for nine of their 22 TD’s.

State Quarterback Tony Rados

is setting season and career pass-.
. ing records with his pitching, while

his favorite receiver, End Jess
Arnelle, isapproaching others. , '
Scouts See Eyeful ‘ .

The phenomenal Arnelle threw
,a scare into Stadium fans last sea-
son as his auspicious offensive
debut almost ruined the Panthers’

- 13-7 victory.

Lion Coach Rip Engle will have
to come up with a stout defense to

 stop the Pitt ground attack, which

has accounted for most of the total
yardage so far.

Dawson no doubt gave the State
scout plenty to talk about when he

had his lads unleash a hippero

dipper offense last Saturday
during the last two periods.
against North Carolina State from
practically every formation, with

slightly ragged, but eye-catching,‘

dispatch. _
Reynolds Rolls Again

For the fourth time this year
Halfback Reynolds outgained the
entire oppositioncn the ground,
while the local defense held down
the enemy runners to a mere 88
yards. The opponents’ average
yardage for the last three games
stands at less than 39 yards.

Besides Reynolds’ usual “brilli-
ance, fancy ball—carrying by ram-
paging Fullback Bobby Epps
helped pile up a season high of 48
points, while the visitors absorbed
their worst licking of the year.

All of which prompted one ob-
server to remark, regarding the
number of local boys on the Wolf-
pack roster, “This is the poorest
team Western Pennsylvania has
put out in some time.”

Coaches Disagree ,
So Kilyk Pays C  

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

  

If Watching a footballgame means only cheering the
home team to victory, the poor sports ‘writers perched on
their typewriter cases in the press box surely miss all the
excitement. Fortunately, there’s more to the Saturday after-
noon outing than reaches the eyes of the Stadium specta-
tors.

Hiding in the corner of the press box last Saturday, for
example, two visiting coaches, Tim Temarario and Beattie Feathers,
supplied the working press with more laughs than. the dull 48-6
rout‘ handed North Carolina State. _ 

Here’s a condensed version of the telephone ~~ conversatio/n
Temarario had with Coaches Horach Hendrickson and Bill Hickman.

Pitt opens ‘ A ' it
the ﬁrst quarter
with three quick
long passes.

Temarario
starts earning his
paycheck.

“What made

like that? Oh,
well, that’s okay,

lyk was in front
of him. Is he

Kilyk, goes out. _

Just then Bobby Epps skips through tackle and -end for the ﬁrst

“He (Harry Lodge)

ﬂank down, end down. Got it? v Beattie, (aside) lhe’s shaking his
head. What’s wrong with that play?” /

Kilyk comes back in the lineup.

“Watch your offsides, boy. Tell our guys we can lay it on too,
a tough football team: All we have to do
is do it.” ’ - ‘ ‘ i

N 0 sooner did Temarario utter these words of wisdom Bill'Adams
and Merle DeLuca converged on a State runner and collided‘. Adams
was carried off the ﬁeldand (DeLuca walked oﬁ, but he, too, .was
shaken up. - " ' I I ’ .- \.

She declined to make any pre-
dictions about how the team would
fare against the opposition, but

Students Discuss

Bowl Possibilities ‘

In Interviews

With bowl talk on the tongues
of most college students around
this time of the year, The Pitt
News went after student interest
in Pitt’s chances in a bowl game.

‘ Queried, “What do you think of
college bowl games?” Students
replied as follows:

Tom Dillis, Engineering, ’51——”I
think it would be a good idea for
‘ Pitt to go to a bowl game be-
cause we would gain prestige,
which is what we need to be
recognized as a football power.”

Harry Hahn, Bus Ad, ’54—-“It
would be most proﬁtable for the
school.”

Bernie Hrosik, Engineering ’53
—“A bowl game would tend to
unify the college. Look at Ohio
State, they’re bowl and football
crazy.”

Dorothy McDonald, Col., ’54-—

“We ought to go; we have a ﬁne I A

team and ought to stay behind
_ them.”

Charles Tucker, Dental, ’5'5——“In
the case of Pitt, I'm deﬁnitely in
favor of a bowl game. We de-
serve one because of the ﬁne
showing we’ve made all season
and the Athletic Department could
use the funds.”

Torn Shilen, Col., ’54———“A bowl‘
game is one of the most exciting
and colorful spectacles of the
year.” D,

. Don Bravin, C01,, ’53——-“A bowl
game would spread the name of
Pitt throughout the nation.”
' John Smithyman, Mines, Jan.,
’53—“I use ten—pins.” -

Gwen Williams, Education, ’53
——“They ought to have them in
Pittsburgh.”

Thomas Schendel, Grad-uate

Bus Ad—-“I’m all for a bowl game
so far as it promotes the school;
but I frown on it as a money
making scheme.”

I‘. J. Routh, Graduate, Educa-

tion——“If your team’s invited,l
the_y’re wonderful; it not, they‘
are of no value.”

Shirley Baxter, Col., ’56—At—

tendance at Saturday’s game was,
terrible._ Perhaps a bowl game!
would give students the properi
school spirit.” ‘
