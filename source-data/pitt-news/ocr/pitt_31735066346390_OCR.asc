Discrimination

The University School of
Nursing has joined the School
of Medicine in opposing racial
and religious discrimination.
At the ~ University Senate
Council, a nursing school
representative said: i

“The School of Nursing recom-
mends that University functions,
official or semi-official, be held
only in public or private facili-
.ties where the expected guests
would experience no discrimina-
tory practices that would cause
embarrassment to either a guest
or the group arranging the func-
tion.”

The School of Medicine faculty
had issued a statement, last June
7, declaring that they would not
“engage in or support University
activities of any nature, oﬁicial or
semi-_-official, which are conducted
in private town or country clubs
which use racial or religious cri-
teria as a basis for membership.”

Other Schools at the University,
the Graduate School of Social
Work and the School of Educa-

-tion, indicated they would sup-
port the resolutions.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld, while in-
dicating that the schools could
move ahead on their own, urged‘
the formulation of a University-
wide policy. Such a policy would
be ratified by the University
Senate. which consists of 100 ad-
ministration and faculty mem-
bers.

University functions which
often includeiforeign guests, have
resulted in embarrassing instances
of discrimination at private clubs,
including some aﬁiliated with the
University.

Student Government Creates
‘Human Relations Committee’

‘During the last two years
attack for alleged discriminat

theiUniversity has been under
ion against various racial and

ethnic minorities, but there has been no organized, disinter-
ested group which could review such claims and report its

ﬁndings, according to Senator

Bob Hepps.

Student Government has created “The Human Relations

Committee of the University of?

Pittsburgh” to meet this need and
others.

They will attempt to promote
understanding, brotherhood, and
more positive interaction be-
tween the many groups represen-
tative of the University, Hepps
reported. , V -

The Committee will work in the
areas of student or campus mem-
bers’ prejudice, discriminitory
practices of the educational in-
stitution or of sections" or parts of
the institution, discriminatory
pressures and practices of the

surrounding community of the in- I

stitution.

The major objective of this
committee will be investigation
of the patterns of human rela-
tions at the University and the
development of recommenda-
tions which will be passed on to
the assistant chancellor of Stu-
dent Affairs.

In order to avoid the appear-
ance of a “crusading, witch-hunt-
ing organization, the Committee
will be composed of two repre-
sentatives from Student Govern-
ment and Pi Theta, the honorary
religious fraternity, and one re-
presentative from the Offices of
the Dean of Men, and the Dean
of Women, the oﬂice of Cultural
and Educational Exchange, Men’s
Council, Associated Women Stu-
dents, Student Union Board, In-
terfraternity Council, Panhellenic
Council, National Association for

ple, and the Pitt News.

committee, hopes that individuals

Course Complaints Justified Temporarily

By TOM BRYANT

Student complaints that many
of the courses listed in the new
Liberal Arts bulletin do not exist
may be justified, but not for long,
according to statements from
Russell A. Dixon. assistant dean
of the School of Liberal Arts.

“The new catalogue is a pre-
view of courses now being offered
and courses coming inithe near
future,” said Dixon.

“In the past year we have
switched to a new curriculum
which provides opportunities for
an outstanding education. How-
ever, only freshmen are now on
the new curriculum.”

A recent Pitt News survey re-
vealed nearly 38 per cent, or
about 259 of a possible 648 cours-
es missing from the fall and win-
ter time scheclules, although the
courses were listed in the cata-
logue.

“Most of that 38 per cent con-

 

sists of qhigqhly specialized courses

is

 

 

’.Arts Bulletin Examined;

which freshmen and sophomores
won’t reach for another year.
By‘ this time next fall. 90 per
cent of the subjects in the bul-
letin will be offered,” Dixon
continued.

Dixon explained that sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors are
still on the old program. “They
must remember that many of the
courses available to them are not
listed in the bulletin and will not
be. Eventually the entire student
body will elect courses from the
new Liberal Arts curriculum.”

Dr. Holbert Carroll, chairman
of the political science depart-
ment, said “Every course listed
under political science in the
catalogue is being oﬁered at least
once every three trimesters.

“Occasionally, a student may
have to wait a_ year to take a
specialized course, but this is
rarely the case. We offer some
subjects every term. depending

Inquiry Club

Speaker Denies

Red Affiliation J

Daniel Rubin, editor of “New
Horizons for Youth,” declined to
answer an accusation before. the
Inquiry Club that he was the na-
tional youth director for the
Communist party in the United
States.

After stating that he funda-
mentally prefers socialism to
capitalism, Rubin said, “I will not
answer any questions about my
afiiliations. I will, however, dis-
cuss my beliefs.”

Asked if he preferred Commu-
nism to capitalism, he replied:
“That is a very complicated ques-
tion. I could talk for hours on it."

The C1ub’s questions were re-
sponses to mimeographed sheets
passed out before the meeting
took place. Testimony from a
meeting of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, April 25,’ 1961, iden-
tified Mortimer D. Rub’in as di-
rector ofithe-«Communist party's
national youth group.

At the Inquiry Club meeting,
Rubin said that a Supreme Court
decision requiring Communists to
register was “something that
threatens everyone, not just Com-
munists.”

In connection with other fed-
eral laws concerning Communism,
lhe editor stated that “there has
never; been any evidence that the
U.S. Communist party is related
to the Russian party except for a
similarity of views on some ques-
tions.”

Rubin had contacted the club as
the editor of “New Horizons for
‘Youth?’ a national monthly, and
asked to speak before their group.

Teacher Retires, Yet  
Continues J oh,F or Free

By Judy Mcislik
Dr. John Calvert Donaldson is without a doubt the lowest
paid faculty member at the University, yet he has never

‘T complained about his salary.

Three years ago Dr. Donaldson was honored with a re-
tirement dinner after 40 years in the teaching profession.
Since that time Donaldson has taught anatomy for no salarv
in a show of his great love for - ’
teaching.

At the age of 70, Donaldson
looks back on alrich and reward
ing career beginning with his un
dcrgraduate days in the Scheﬂiel
Scientiﬁc School at Yale Univer
sity.

  
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
 
  
  
 
 
   
  
  
 
   
     

Jumped at Chance
In 1916 Donaldson was offere
a position in the department 0
anatomy at the University of Cin
cinnati and, as he put it, “I jump
ed at the chance to go into teach
ing.” ~
Donaldson joined the Univer-
sity faculty ‘in 1921 and for 15
years comprised the department
of anatomy with Dr. Hooker,
head of the department until
1955, and Dr. Nicholas.
, One of the greatest rewards
that Dr. Donaldson recalls was
“working out the diﬂiculties of
developing the department fro
the very primitive state it was in ii 
when he arrived.
Express Affection
He has watched the trend in
education shift from emphasis on
teaching to emphasis on research.
His personal belief is that “teach-
ing provides the wonderful expe-
rience of working with young
people and seeing them develop
into successful individuals.”
At his retirement dinner, he

Freshman Opportemit y

' Whether or not Student Government can become an
effective representative of the student body will be decided
in part by 1100 freshmen students this Thursday. At this
time the three freshmen ‘senators will give their contempo-

raries an opportunity to meet, question and discuss with
them prominent problems now on campus. The number of

students who take part in these discussions will indicate
if the apathy now hindering SG can be irradicated in the
next few years or not.

Foregoing the assumption, at last, that students with
problems will come to them, the senators are making an
honest attempt to meet their public and ﬁnd out what the
students they represent actually think on major issuesor
what could be. major issues on campus.

It is unfortunate that in the past, students have had
such little regard for their spokesmen that the only people
who attend the open senate meetings are those two or
three each term who want to ﬁll vacant senate seats.

Constantly ﬁxing the blame for SG’s past failings on its
internal. structure is not an entirely true picture of the
situation. Indifferent students can only produce indifferent
ofﬁcials, no matter how vital the structure. SG needs
student support.

Too often students feel that they have no means for ex-
pression when in reality they are ignoring one of the most
important means available. The recent book store commit-
tee report is a good indication of the type of action possible
by SG. Whether students agree with the explanations or
not, by attending senate meetings and discussing things
openly, one aspect of the much needed and much cried for
intra—University communications can be solved, in part
at least.

The freshman class has a challenge facing it which if
ignored can only worsen a new poor situation. While the
effects of this week’s program will not be immediate, the
future possibilities can only be realized if supported now.

Death Be Not Piiblic . .;_."

    CancerCountclown

By lno Amdur _
Sam Rayburn is dying of cancer. He knows it;
his relatives know it, and so do one hundred and
eighty-ﬁve million other Americans. When John
Foster Dulles died of the same illness, we all knew

about that too. One wonders when the American '

press will realize that there are some moments in
a man’s life which he does not wish’ to share with
his fellow Americans, and that
even our hallowed motto of “to-
getherness” has its limits. It
would be very understandable if
Mr. Rayburn did not particular-
ly look forward to or appreciate
the publication of his state of
health every day in the news-
papers accompanied by the
count—down of how many more

The newspapers do not miti-
gate the aloneless of death. They
just turn it into something resembling a three-

month horse race. The _only differences are that the
ﬁnishing line is the ultimate one; there’s,only one
man running; and he gets no prize when he reaches
his destination. His only reward is a long article in
the newspaper, the last article, telling one hundred

V and eighty—ﬁve million Americans that at the very

end Mr. Rayburn clutched his Bible and saluted
the American flag. The newspaper will tell us what
his last words were, who ‘was with him at his
death, and what the reactions of the people were
when he died. If possible, all statements will be
liberally accompanied with photographs of the
death scene.
Morbid As Movie

The entire grotesque prolonged funeral is rem-
iniscent of a scene in themovie, “La Dolce Vita”,
where a woman has just lost her two children and
her husband by a murder—suicide, and when she is

Against The Lonely . . .

 

informed of the disaster the photographers want to

get a “good shot” of her face. Then millions‘ ofpeo-
_p1e can look at the naked. face of grief over their

mbrning coﬁee, and then can use the paper to wrap
thegarbage. |. _ . L '
There is a cruel streak in human beings which

‘makes us rush to the scene of a crime, and 

jokes at a funeral. Perhaps this phenomenon is
present because we are really happy that the ca-
lamity is not ours, and that the" funeral is some-
body e1se’s. We make grief wear a public mask and
death dress up in its best clothes, and then we gloat
over our good fortune behind a facade of mourning.

Sam Rayburn and all public ﬁgures who die
day by day in the columns of our newspapers‘ are
being cheated out of the few months of the most
meaningful prix/lacy and soligtude in a human be-
ing‘s life. Death isnot a public affair; on the con-
trary, it is the most private affair that a person
ever experiences’. I

Woolf Cries

 

‘#4

Virginia Woolf once had one of her fictional ‘

characters say, “We perish, each alone.” This is
surely accurate and even the American assumption
that nobody ought to do anything alone is defeated
by this simple truth. A A

In American life we are so used to public-rela-
tions men, conferences, and committees,’ that we
have forgotten the fact that ultimately anything

of enduring value springs-from the mind of one

individual and is directed to the minds of other in-
dividuals. As a corollary of this, we assume that
just as the committee has replaced the individual in
his lifetime, so can the public-relations men and
journalists replace the individual in his death. It
can’t be done, not in life, and not in death. Virginia
Woolf will have the last word. We do perish each
alone and all the newspaper reports in the world
only intensify rather than mitigate this sad but true
human reality.

Unique Persecution

By Matthew Nesvisky

Almost as soon as man began to invent systems
of religion, he invented religious prejudice. It was
originally practiced with an insane but mild theme:
“Your idol is different from mine. Therefore it is
no good. Therefore I will not stand for it.”

History grinningly shows us where this led: the
Romans’ unique fodder for their lions in the Cir-
cus Maximus; Torquemada’s in-
genious toys during the Spanish
Inquisition; A. Hitler and Com-
penny; and the Ku Klux Klan’s
kute kutups.

At any rate, the whole story
‘drips red with religious persecu-
tion. Our history is, in fa,c.t,,so
coated with this senseless gore
that it is almost enough to cause
one to reject religion altogether.
Not the Answer

But this, surprisingly per-
haps, is deﬁnitely not the answer. For it seems that
those people who refuse to affiliate themselves with
organized worship groups have been and are now
persecuted and prejudiced against with an equal
amount of ugly thoughtlessness.

This columnist is not speaking from first—hand
experience, but it appears to me that an atheist, for
example, has a more diiﬁcult time of it under the
pressures of prejudice than does a Protestant,
Catholic or Jew. These latter groups have or are
now suffering from persecution, but they all have
their beliefs and doctrines to comfort them. It was
nothing more than unﬂinching faith that allowed
the survival of the ancient Christian in the cata-
combs, or the Protestant on the rack, or the Jew
in the concentration camp.

But the atheist does not have a rigid code of
beliefs in which to put his trust. True, he may have
an inexorable faith in the idea that there is no
God, but just by sheer weight of numbers, this
makes himia lonely, lonely man.

Prejudice pushes the agnostic into an equally
uncomfortable corner. This man will not lean to
one side or the other. He will not fully accept or
fully reject the concept of God. This leads most
people to believe that either there is something
wrong with him or that he is a “wiseguy egghead.”

As a result, the atheist and the agnostic must

t

reﬁll;

   
    

 

prevélrﬁa s itsaheavrbattle whether _   

decide to assign themselves those titles.

Today, the persecution of the non—religious is
not a bloody affair, but these unfortunates are
often limited in their social and economic sphere.

Employers are often wary of the blank space
left after the heading “Religious Preference” on the
job applications which they receive. And one New
York labor union was recently broiled by the gov-
ernment for making a religious choice mandatory.
Roadblock to Peace

Another roadblock to one‘s peaceful enjoyment
of Godlessness is the fact that too many people as-
sociate Communism with atheism. Not all Commu-
nists are atheists, although one may have a hard
time making them admit it, and likewise,- some of
our greatest patriots, including Jefferson, refused to
belong to a church. .

But the battered atheists and agnostics have
still another difﬁculty: the phoney church-avoider.
Knocking God has become somewhat of a fad late-
1.YL311d just as a churc,h~goer does not want a
“holier-than-thou” chestbeater sitting next to him
on the same pew, so do atheists and agnostics re...
sent those who try to join their meager ranks
merely for the purpose of getting attention.

An example of, this is the recently released gold
medallion which is engraved with the words “I Am
An Atheist." This novelty item is a great laugh-
getter, perverted as that laughter may be, but to a
man who chooses to walk without God, the laugh
is directed straight at him.

These illustrations indicate, I believe, that this
unique persecution is quietly but steadily growing
in this country. And if the law grants one the right
to choose his religion and practice it, it should also
secure one’s right to avoid it if he is so inclined.

Career Cues

“Hitch your wagon to
a ‘growth’ industry-
and grow with it!”

Doug/as Leigh, President
Doug/as Leigh, Inc.

“A growth industry is a new industry that is on the
way up — moving quickly, expanding fast. When you
join a company in one of the growth fields you have
something extra working for you . . . you grow up with it.
To find out which industry is right for you, try this: Ask
someone in a good investment office to give you a list of
the industries he considers ‘growth industries’. Data

Douglas Leigh, a Camel smoker
for more than seventeen years,
started his career at the Univer-
sity of Florida by selling space
in the yearbook. Today, Doug is
building the biggest spectacular:
of his career in the Times Square
area, and is a director of the New
York World's Fair of ’_64—’65.

Plan your pleasure ahead, too.

Goodness Discovered in” Common Man
Midday Speaker Reads, Explains

Tagore’s Message for Mankind .

By PAT CHERKIN

“When thou commandest
me to sing it seems that my
heart would break with pride;
and l look to thy face, and
tears come to my eyes . . . I
touch by the edge of the far

spreading wing of my song thy

"feet which I could never aspire

to reach.” In this, from one of his
most beautiful “Gitanjali”, the
poet Rabindranath Tagore has
found his mission.

Dr. Amiya Chakravarty, expert
on Tagore and editor of “A Tagore
Reader,” explained to the Midday
Series audience that the poet's
genius was due to his ability to
discover goodness in common
man and make songs from ordi-
nary affairs.

Dr. Chakravarty, relating “Ta-
gore ‘And The Spirit of India,”
talked of the problems posed in
the translations of Tagore: The
poet wgote in Bengali, a language
which is little known and read.
Tagore, he said, “had no illusions
in regard to the processes of t.ran-
slation.”

Rather, he seemed to feel that
his poems would be of more serv-
ice to his people if left unadult-
erated to be sung by the Bengali
villagers. He was anonymous to
these people who echoed his

’ _ words as folk-songs.

Essence Universal

Regardless of his reticence, the
essence of Tagore’s poetry, though
perhaps inadequately translated,
is meant for all mankind. Dr.
Chakravarty a s s e r t e d this
throughout his speech as he em-
phasized the simplicity and all-
inclusive profundity of -the man
and his writing. In the speaker’s
words: “Tagore could weave into
magical form some of the subtlest
feelings of the human hea1;.”

Tagore knew the world be-
yond and was equipped to reach
“below the subsoil, into the
ground of human experience”
for his material. He expressed
his hopes and growing feelings
“that man is emerging rapidly
into an era of human whole-
ness.” .

Tagore’s religion, C‘hakra\'arty
said, is religion with a capital R.
It encompases deeper things,
things not visible. The poet proph—
esied that those who adjust their
lives to this inner knowledge, are
those who will survive.

Chakravarty concluded the
noon session by- singing in the
original Bengali Tagore’s “The
Evening,” which proclaims man’s
migrational instinct, wherein he
should “use his wings and reach
the sky.”

Explains Concept of Deity

At the coffee hour Dr. Chakra-
varty talked with a small group,
answering varied questions. In
trying to illuminate India’s con-
cept of deity and spirituality, he
prophesied: “This power, what-
ever it is, I have a hunch will
continue to save us even beyond
the nuclear threat.”

Prints Anti-Red Paper

By MATT SWETONIC . 

Alfred C. Ackenheil, professor of Civil Engineering at

the University, has recently brought out a new pamphlet on
the threat of Communism in the modern world.

st Take Time,” according to
people in the U. S. to dedicate

and commit themselves to our way of life as expressed in

‘faith’ and ‘freedom.’ and to put it9
into action in our own nation and
in other parts of the world.”

“It is not so much anti—eom-
munist.” continue.s Ackenheil, “as
it is ‘Get going America’ in what
you believe in.”

, Dominates Press

“We had formerly been con-
cerned on the basis of what ‘we
had heard and read, but Russia
impressed us as being much
stronger than we had envisioned."

“The communists have so
dominated their press from an

information standpoint t h a t

the:v’ve got the Russian people

like the West Virginia team
before the Pitt game: ‘Go get
the‘m.’”

“They have a great competitive
spirit: as regards educational op-
portunities” continues Ackenheil,

“and they have placed a great em-
phasis upon the study of engineer-

ing and science. As a result, this
nation is becoming very strong in
these fields.”

’ Quality Equals Ours

“They have more engineers and
scientists graduating each year
than we do, and their quality-is at
least equal to ours and could
easily be 50 per cent better.”

According to Ackenheil, “this
stems from Lenin’s plan to de-
velop this nation into a force
for world domination.”

In order to defeat the communist
threat Ackenheil urges that all
Americans take more interest in
the study of the communist plans
for world domination, become
serious about the power of prayer,
and learn more about their own
“freedom and herita,;>;e.”

The American citizen, he ‘con-
cludes, “must be willing to sacri-
ﬁce everything to the fight against
con'u‘nunisrn.”

HUESBANDS,‘ ANYONE?

It has been alleged that coeds go to college. for the sole purpose
of ﬁnding husbands. This is, of course, an infamous canard, and
I give lairiwarning that., small and spongy asl am, anybody
who says such a dastardly thing when I am around had hette.r
be prepared for a sound thrasliing!

Girls go to college for precisely the same, reasons as men do:
to broaden their horizons, to lengthen their vistas, to drink at
the fount ol’ wisdom. But, if, by pure (-lianee, while a girl is
eiigaged in these meritorious pursuits, a likely looking lmshand

‘should pop into view, why, what’s wrong with tli-at? lﬂln‘? VVlm,t-'3

wrong with that‘?

The question now arises, what should a girl look for in a
husband. A great deal has been written on this subject. Some
say clnaraeter is most, important,. some say background, some
say a.ppea.1'an<:e, some say edu<::at»ion. All are wrong.

The most important thing Jbar none »«-in a husband is healtli.
Tl|()ll{.{ll he be handsome as Apollo and rich as Midas, what good
is he it he just lays around all day acmirrmlating beds0res'.’

The very first thing; to do upon meeting a inan is to make
sure he is sound of wind and -limb. Before he has a chance to
sweet-talk you, slap a thermometer in his mouth, roll back his
eyelids, yank out his tongue, rap his patella, palpate his thorax,
ask him to ;~:traight.en out a horseshoe with his teeth. l t' he fails
these simple tests, phone for an arnl)ul:i.ne.e. and go on to the
Inert mospect.

If, however, he turns out to be physically fit, proceed to the
second most important requirement in a husband. I refer to 9.
sense of humor. ‘

A man who (rant; take a joke is a man to be avoided. There
are several simple tests to find out whetvlner your prospect can
take a jokeor not. You ezm, for example, slasli his tires. Ur hum

iBy LEO BERENFIELD

Howard University cele-
brated its Homecoming Sat-
urday afternoon at the ex-
pense of the Pitt soccer team,

as the Panthers were handed
a 4-1 defeat.

"Although the Panther hooters
dominated the play early in the
game, moving the ball very well,
they missed several scoring op-
portunities. Howard, ho w ev er,
cashed in on one of its chances
when Alex "Romeo scored the in-
itial ‘goal of the game for the
Bisons. Pitt evened the score just
b<-srfore the first half ended when
Bob Cuthbert tallied for the Cats.

in the second half it was 3
diﬁfcrent story, as the Bisons took
complete command of the game.
The Howard squad played inspir-
ed soccer, led by Alexis, who
scored two goals, and _Durham,
who chipped in with one more.

Injuries Hurt Team

Pitt’s downfall was due mainly
to the many injuries which the
’l’a.nth<-zrs sustained during the

Mame. Sichel’s loss hampered the
Panther attack greatly for he did
a fine job of passing while he
played. ,

Other injuries were sustained»
by Hannington Okoth, Ray Ta-
rasi, and Chuck Dunbar, who
rcinjured his leg. As Pitt soccer
coach Leo Bemis stated, “The
referees allowed the game to get
a little rough.”

Grove City provides the opposi-
tion for the Panther booters to-
morrow afternoon. The game be-
gins at 3:00 at the Stadium.

Although it is doubtful that any
of the injured players will see
action against Grove City, Coach
Bemis is hopeful the boys will be

The Mountaineers’ Roger Mader,
Charlie Rea, and Joe Kubic were
second, third, and fourth across
the ﬁnish line respectively.

Pitt’s Bill Moonik, last_ year’s
leading freshman runner, but an
erratic performer so far this sea-
son, ﬁnished ﬁfth this time and
may ﬁnally be regaining his old
form. He came on strongly to-
wards the end, but by then it was
too late to change the outcome of
the contest. Dick Cook ran his

 

up seventh.

The real disappointment, how-
ever, was the failure of Larry Ro-
binson to come in near the top.
Robinson has almost consistently
been the Jungle Cats’ number-two
man, but against the Mounties the
sophomore could finish no higher
than eighth.

“The contest was a lot closer
than the score indicated,” ex-
plained Coach Carl Rees. “Was-
lo ranextremely well, turning
in one of the best times ever run
on the West Virginia course.
The lead changed hands several
times. Pitt led after the first
mile, but after the second mile
West Virginia was ahead. We
grabbed the lead later, but again
we couldn’t hold on to it.”

“Our middle men didn’t run as
well as they should have,” con-
tinued the Pitt mentor. “They
were more competitive this week,
but it still wasn’t enough.”

The Panther Cubs salvaged
some prestigefor the varsity by
winning their third consecutive
meet, swamping the Mountie year-
lings, 22-36. John Bailey led the
frosh along with Gary Burns and
Ralph Basinski.

Bob Kane of Munhall, a

Saturday at University Park

year men succumbed for the first
time.

A Losing War

At the Naval Academy, football
is regarded as the closest appro-
ximation of war. If bruises are
the criterion, the academy was
never more successful in simulat-
ing actual battle conditions.

Down to the end, Navy dis-
played boundless courage, but it
was a. thoroughly hobbled goat
that made its way wearily home
from its worst defeat this year.

“THE 3800”

Football coaches have toiled so assiduously to create the
legend that they are developers of character, and Wayne
Hardin, the dapper Navy coach outﬁtted in Ivy League ap-
parel, doesn’t disturb the legend any.

A baseball manager, a horse trainer, or the proprietor of
a prizeﬁghter is seldom encountered in a cathedral discours-
ing upon the spiritual values of the game, but the American
football coach (whether at Tufts or at Navy), must be phil-
osophical about the game, especially when he loses.

The freckle-faced coach, who could pass for Tom Sawyer
if someone stole his wardrobe, was approached in the sweat-
smelled dressing room under the Stadium bleachers after
his recruits had fallen to Pitt, 28-14.

Football Class

“Football is not the number one objective at the Acad-
emy,” Hardin said. “It’s just like any other class. We spend
an hour and a half in the afternoon practicing football just
like it was a chemistry lab or English literature class.

“These boys are football players second, Midshipmen
ﬁrst. They must be able to defend our countryin case of
war, and they study theories of military defense much more
than ways to defense Pitt’s ground attack.”

“Anyhow you never in life saw so many skinny
kids with glasses as we get at the Academy. It scares
you to death to see them when they first arrive. They’re
all students.

‘.‘We get some heavy kids, but they don’t stay that way
for long. They have to train so hard, they’re honed to a razor
sharp edge——too ﬁne, like some of the roast beef you get in
those plush restaurants.

Can‘? Cry About Standards

“We play against a lot of kids we would’ve like to have
had at the Academy, but we don’t cry about it. We don’t
have to play any particular team. But sometimes I wonder
how these schools can justify admitting kids that can’t read
or write.”

Before Hardin came to Annapolis, during the coaching
era of Eddie Erdelatz, the football program was on a different
setup. The gridders attended their own separate classes, en-
joyed certain privileges and stayed aloof of the brigade.

Now the segregation has ended, and the bespectacled
students and the bruising gridders intermingle. “The
‘3800’ was the name of our team last year,” Hardin ex-
plained, the number representing the number of Mid-
shipmen enrolled at the Academy. E

“The kids feel deeply when we lose,” Hardin said. “Our
plebes get a chance to carry on once in a while when we win.
There is no better spirit persisting as that which we have at
the Academy.”

A reporter needled, “How about Army?”

“None better!” Hardin roared, as if the questioner was an
upstart plebe, who questioned an order. “It might be as
good,” Hardin conceded, “but none better!”
"We're Never Down" -

Then how come the letdown by the high-spirited, light-

hearted Navy eleven in the Pitt fracas? “We weren’t down,”

Hardin claimed. “Pitt was just sky-high. We’re never
down! You can’t be in our league (which includes William
& Mary, Virginia and Cornell, all power-houses in the intra-
mural loop). We have to be up for ten weeks.”
The Midshipmen are showing a highly respectable
4-2 record at this point, having lost the opener to Penn
State, and are surprising a lot of experts who ﬁgured
they wouldn’t win without All-American Joe Bellino and

21 other seniors. -

A “I’m extremely pleased,” Hardin remarked. “They have
worked hard, and have trained hard. I wouldn’t trade my
kids for anybody.”

Most of his kids didn’t appear extremely saddened, how-
ever, after the crushing loss to the Panthers. They seemed

highly concerned about their “blind dates” for the evening.

Today some of them‘ are probably even more concerned about
the “Matchmakers,” who did the picking.
No Considerations ‘ ’

Greg Mather, the All—American candidate at end, ex-
pressed the feelings of the Midshipmen football players.
“We’re not treated specially,” he said. “No considerations.
We’re closer to the brigade. Now We’re their team,”

“Go Get ’Em F ellasi’

in centuries — time goes slow for
losers. The atmosphere was prob-
ably most clearly revealed by an
innocent Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi.
The backfield coach had an ap-
petite this Saturday, but it went
amiss. “Not even an apple for
me!” he squealed, searching in an
empty carton.

“Everyone was working to-
gether,” Coach John Michelosen
disclosed. “They were all doin’
their own jobs. Boy, it’s great to
win!”

Navy’s, athletic director, Capt.
Asbury Coward, as beﬁts an old
salt, made an appearance in
Michelosen’s cubbyhole, shaking
the winning coach’s hand with a
ﬁrm grip. “It was a great win,
John,” he said emphatically.
“You earned it! (Pause) You beat
the hell out of us!”

him, but none tackled him. He re-
versed his ﬁeld and kept going.”

Go For Broke
Pitt struck back when Bill Beck
scored on a 4-yard charge. Fred
Mazurek passed to Ron Robson
for a two-point play. But the 14-
6 lead was not enough.
Joe Vargo scored for State be-
fore the half on an eight-yard
dash. The Lion frosh went for
the tying point, deciding to kick.
The Cubs blocked the attempt,
Ron Cimino frustrating the
kicker, but it went for naught.
The Cubs were off-side again.
On the second chance, State
scored on a pass for the two
points and the eventual victory.
The disgruntled Cubs attended
the Penn State-California game
that afternoon. When the an-
nouncer bellowed the Pitt varsity
score at the end of the third
quarter. 21-0, a loud cheer went
up from the frosh rooters.

 

When asked how he felt
about being compared to Pitt's
Mike Ditka, a star for the Chi-
cago Bears now, he said, “I
hope that I can be compared
to him. I’m not tooting my
own horn!”

He doesn’t have to. The
drum and bugle corps of “the
3800” will do a loud job.

What makes Artcarved Diamonds the
favorite of America’s College Queens?

Actually there are many reasons. Artcarved diamond rings
must meet traditionally high standards for color, cut, clarity
and carat weight. Their award-winning styles are a_ delight
to the eye. And, they take all of the guesswork out of buying
a diamond. Every Artcarved ring carries a written guarantee
for quality and permanent value that’s recognized and re-
spected by ﬁne jewelers from coast to coast. We think you'll
agree with America's lovely College Queens. _

.,,Stop in at your jeweler and be sure to see all the exquisite
Artcarved diamond rings—-the rings you buy with conﬁdence
and wear with pride.

“Mike Ditka is the greatest
competitor I’ve ever played
with or against.”

So says Steve Jastrzernbski,
the Panther’s No. 1 left end,
and Ditka’s understudy for
four years. “Although I received
many offers to go to college,” re-
ﬂects the 63", 205 pound end from
Vanderg'ril‘t, Pa, “I ‘guess it was
just late that I’d go to a school
where I'd play behind an All-

American at my position. I did a I

lot of learning while playing be-

While waiting in the wings,

l,Heflerle (now head coach at Bos-

lton College), who recruited me,

édisclosed. “He improved my run-
 ning of pass patterns and improved
Erny blocking. He was tremendous

A/later the Panther gridders had
lost to the Washington Huskies at
Seattle, reserve guard, Ralph Con-
rad, got a note bf consolation from
his father upon his arrival back
at the campus. “I hear that you
didn't get to play much on Satur-
day,” Conrad’s father wrote, “but,
don’t let it get you down."

“At least if you’re not oplaying,
you wont get hurt.‘ Ralph smiled
about his .father‘s ‘words, then
limped out of

Marshall CONRAD
Goldberg, Jr. arrived. back on

arm in a sling. He had just been

where he had an operation per-

job was done to cure Goldberg’s

It. is interesting tonote that the
sports stall of The Pittsburgh Press
is well stocked with, writers who
matriculated from The Pitt News.
Currently four loy-lines are ap-
pearing in the downtown daily
which once appeared in the cam-
pus sheet: Don Giﬂin, Will Doerge,
Russ Franke and Steve Butchock.

Another alumnus of the News,
Myron Cope had a ﬁne piece in

When a boy has to sit out a '

year, he can start to feel sorry
for himself, or get down in the
dumps. but Steve considers this
a great training period. “A boy
