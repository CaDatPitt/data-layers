--  Hectic Year

fllni reviewing, theﬂwork of . the

present ‘council overfthe. past nine
months? period, it has been a year
of -‘ups and downs for the governing
body which has been subject to fre-
quent criticism for lack of purpose;
yet the present body in expiring does
not leave the year a total loss. ‘to
set; forth‘ some of the accomplish-
ments of the group this.year is to
mention thefac-ti that througlrcoun'-‘-
cil’s efforts the library was opened
Sunday afternoons, ‘a traffic light
was installed at Bigelow Boulevard
and Bayard street, a creditable se-
ries, of ‘discussion .. assemblies was
successfully fostered, and a voice
.was,won for the none too enthusias-

tic. public'at‘ion heads when it came,

to selecting- their successors, and
lastly, progress has been madeito-V
ward se regated student govern-.
ment at itt.

Measures Unsettled

Several measures are hanging ﬁre
as the present council steps out and
leaves the destinies of the campus
to nexih-year’s, group. Prominent
among ese are the investigation
into the‘ need for a vocational guid-
ance department and the discussions
ovef segregated government.‘ _ .
_ to sev-
eral ofUthe' retiring mem
council has been brought into the
limelight during the past two. weeks
because of some rather shoddy bits
of lgfgislation including the post-
ponement of -the referendum onythe‘
proposed .men’s’_ self-governing asso-
ciation and the slip-up onthe schol-
arrsitaip requirement for nominees. to
ca pus offices. '

One of the highlights of the past
year was the tiif , which developed
in‘ J anuaryrbetween council and’ the
Pitt “Weekly. Incensed. by some.
rather‘ direct attacks at the apathy
with which council was considering
student legislation, the governing
body called Norman L. Park.,- Col.
’30, editor of the Weekly, to ac-
count. Park responded and ‘ac-
quainted-sicouncil with several” meas-=
tires that were demanding immedi-
ate consideration.

Real Work _ Done

;, Council accepted Park's sugges-
tions in good faith and the result
found the library opened on Sunday
afternoons, thus giving students ad--
ditional time for referencework, an
explanation from the athletic ede-
partment in regard ._to the exchange
of student books, laying of new side-
walks along University drive and in-
stallation of the traffic light on the
boulevard. i , -

. One of the" movement fostered
by council and which met with lit-
tle evident success in its ﬁrst year
was the -renewal of ‘freshman cus-
toms. Council has resolved to give
this ‘plan another try next year and
with" several alterations in the plans
professes ‘to foresee a successful pe-
gig? ‘for°‘the frosh regulations next

a .

A committee on student ‘loyalty
formed early this year did little
real work on its own account but
contributed to the reports -of the
men’s self-governing association
committee.

Witlivthis issue the present; staﬁ of 'the_.. Pitt Weekly makes its. ﬁnal
bow to the Pitt public’ and approvingly entrusts the results of its efforts
to ltlig. "younglings who take hold where we leave‘ off. Conventiontlity
forces upon us the'—na.tu'ru,l custom'o£ saying! ﬁnal adieuto our readers
in additidn. to offerlnglthanlta ﬁnd begginglndulgencesl for the last time.

§'1‘hc scene’ isﬁini perfect accord_;wi~th.our mood, The last shafts of
daylight sweep over-the‘ stadium into the windows of our oﬁice‘ and trans-
form the dusty typewriters into-realities. Outside in‘ the commons room
some stray idler picking a. melancholy tune on the pianou And the
last cub has retreatcdyfrom our threats of annihiliation. ‘ .  ‘

The.year has been a. good one and an interesting. one. We have done
nothing for which to expect regrets. We have had ‘our quarrels and our
battles but all this -is“7:forgotten»in these last moments. ‘ Through the en-
tire siege our motives have always been the" highest. All that we have
dong in antagonism to those whose points of View differed we did in full

.pccord with our unﬂinching editorial policy. In the backgh-ound of our

lmindhas. always rested a better University of Pittsburgh, :1 better‘ place
for students,.and a. higher? accomplishment of a. dream unfulﬁlled.

We pause now to thank our staff for its work during the year. Each
individual member gave willingly of his time and efforts that theweekly
, The material rewards are
too meagre to speak of but we are assured that members of ‘the; stall’,
whetfherreporters or department editors, have proﬁted greatly from their
work on the paper. They have made new and interesting‘ contacts: they
have} learned a. great deal concerning’ t University and its workiflgs;

they have learned- even more of themselves and their abilities; and ‘they. ~

have had opportunities to, spill the bounds of their personalities’ into the
channelslof editorial release. ' I ~ ,

The new staff enters the ﬁeld now. We can only urge‘_.tha-t they be-
gin where we leave. o;f. and carry the work on to the goal of never‘ reached

perfection. The "road, a hard one, is-' nevertheless an interesting one. Each.

little pitfall presents a new experienceto try the genius of manand the
patience of his heart. The new staﬂ’ will learn that it can never please
the entire student body. It will learn to accept the other student's point
of view on an equal plane with its own. . _ .

But, it. will learn what the University of Pittsburgh is and it will

‘ secure a Mt. Ncbo: vision of theaims and «aspirations of those who guide
‘the destinies in the industry of education.

To any one who has in any way or measure contributed to the‘ or-
ganized efforts of the Pitt Weekly during the year  say a hearty
“Thank You.” ’ . ‘ ’ ,

   Have Plays Day Of

Tomorrow the ‘University welcomes as its guests some hundred and
ﬁfty women from other schools in the? tri-state district, here to partici-
pate in the Play Day exercises, sponsored by the Women's Self-Govern-
ing Association. . « g ’ l .

Plans. call for 9. complete program of athletic events followed. by a

' dinner at which " Missy Blanche Trilling of the University of Wisconsin

will .be the Slibaker. ‘ C ,

This active participation in sports calls to ,mind the freedom en-
joyed by the modern; college woman as compared with her sister of even
a dozenyears ago. Time was when the coed conﬁned her campus ac.-
tivities to the language. clubs -and" social organizations. » Now the only
thing she lacks is a football team. ._ . . . - ’ ~

It willbe a ﬁneget-together today and Pitt extends. its full measure
of hospitality most gladly. V .

 EE T cTOMORROW 

AV squad of twenty-three Pitt runners and weightnrlen
will leave in a bus today for Morgantown,-where tomorrow they
will meet‘ the standard-bearers of West Virginia, Carnegie
‘Tech’ and Washington and Jefferson in the fourth annual “Big
Four’? track and ﬁeld championships to be held at the Moun-
taineer stadium under the auspices of Washington and Jeffer-

son college.

i ~ Pitt won the ﬁrst “Big Four” championsh__ip’which, was

held at the West Virginia stadium. "‘ '

West Virginia won‘ the next two
meets mainly through their garner-
in§i‘5i" alarge number of seconds
and- ‘thirds, while ’the Panthers
were capping most of the first
places.. The -Mountaineers will be
favored to repeat tomorrow because
of their a.ll—around strength.

‘ "The meet will not prove a walk-
away, however, as the Panthers are
determined to ﬁght the Mountain-
eers to.the.end.. Despite their lack
of probable first place winners in
the distance events andi in the

weights, the Pitt total should be

rather high. Bowen and Harris
should score heavily for Pitt in the

sp,rints,_ and Utterback and Goodwin

should garner their share of points

'i.'i1.; theﬂjumps. Knobloch should win

the hurdles and possibly the jave-V
lini throw- If these men are given
alittle helpV by the weight men and
the distance men, Pitt may surprise
the Mountaineers. Q -

_Caesar, Jerpe and Alberts should
al.l;=_' garner some points in the dis-
t'ai1ce‘races,,and Mazzei, Thiele and
Sinoyer may well be expected to add
a few; points to thepPitt total. In
the weights, Les Cohen, Hirshberg
and Weiler can.be depended upon
to win a few points, so the task of
,the-_/Pitt men is not as hopeless as it
may at first seem. If the boys are
"on" tomorrow, the ﬁnal result will
be exceedingly close. _ ' ’

Mountaineers Hopeful _
The Mountaineers willplace their
main hopes for victory on the shoul-
ders. of “Runt” Callaway, sopho-
more jumper, who defeated Knob-

‘loch in adual meet during the‘in-

door season; Waggoner, _veteran
sprinter; Hill and Goldstem, two

experiments.

Brand, distance men. ’ There will be A

others to help these boys‘ along, as
the Mountaineers this year, as in
other years, have a, well balanced

‘team that maycop the-honors even

thou h their share of ﬁrst places
may e very small.

Carnegie Tech and Wash-Jeff, the
other—- two contestants, will . hardly

press the Panthers or the Mountain-

eers for top’ honors; but they may

determine» the final results byxthe '

number of Pittand West» Virginia
men they shut‘ out in their battle
for places.

Points will be scored at this. meet
in the same manner as in the past.
Five points will go to the ﬁrst place
winners, four to the second place
winners, three to the third place
winners, two to the fourth place
winners, and one to the ﬁfth man

in ‘each event.

Cagle is seen above in

His .Marriage

The reason for this condition is the
fact that the famous red-head has
resigned from the U. S. Military
Academy “by request.” , J A -_ " ’

The reason advanced by the Army
oficers for their request of Cagle’s
resignation is that the all-American

ly respected regulations for West
Poﬁit cadets. The ﬁrst of theseiwas
that "he married Marion Munford
Hails‘, a young girl whom he. met
during his “prep school” ‘ days at
Southwestern Institute. This was
only the first violation. .

When Cagle returned to school
that fall—,—he had married Miss I-Iaile.
during his summer furloughin 1928,
he signed a statement (which all
cadets are required todo), saying
that he ha\d"not ‘violated any Army
regulations duringhis furlough. This
was without doubt the most ﬂagrant
of, the two violations of Army reg-
ulations by Cagle.

Cagle admitted his marriage when
questioned "by Colonel M. A. Shock-
ley, post surgeon at West Point; and

resignation from the Army to Wash-
ington. The acceptance of Cagle’s
resignation will be _formally- an-
nounced by. Army. officials shortly.

START ANNUAL
TOURNAMENT

Serni-ﬁnals Scheduled May 23;
Finals To Be Held May 26 _

 

 

At last the interfraternity court
then have begun work in earnest.
The tournament opened last Friday
and was continued Saturday, Tues-
day and Wednesday. The matches
will continue at the rate of two a
weekuntil May 29,- the date of the
semi-ilnals. Then the big affair will
close its activities with a match be-
tween these semi-finalists on the
twenty-sixth. ,

The Phi Gamma Deltas, led by
Chipper Charley Hyatt of basketball
fame, defeated the Theta Delta Psis
on Tuesday. Hyatt won both his sin-
gles and doubles matches to ice the

victory for the Phi Gains. The Pi
Lambda Phi boys won their second
victory in a row when the Alpha Phi
Delta boys failed to appear for their
scheduled match.

‘The matches scheduled for
Wednesday were called off due to
the dampness of the term ﬁrma, but
play was continued yesterday.

The real fireworks were started
last Friday when Theta Delta Psi
toppled. over the Theta Kappa Nu
racqueceers. Tom Boyd lost the ﬁrst
set for the winners, but Adams and
Kllzigensrnitli took the second set;.
and to close the affair, Adams took
over Clancy to cop the Theta Delta
Psis first win in as many starts.

' Phi Kaps Lose

In the second encounter of the aft-
ernoon, the Pi Lambda Phis gave
the Phi Kappas a lesson in how ten-
nis should be played. Ed. deMesqui-
ta‘ took a haurd,‘I"ast set from Bob
Kleeb of Cap and Gown fame, 9-7;
6-3.‘ - And then Jerry Rosenberg
hauled Jimrny Mansmahn through‘
the courts dust, 6-2; 6-2.

Of the other matches scheduled,
the winners got their verdict through
default when their opponents failed
toput in an appearance. Phi Delta
Theta got the’ verdict over a non-
appfearlng Sigma Alpha Epsilon
team; while Delta Sigma Phi, in the
same manner, gave the Sigma Alpha
Mus a win.

The same rules governing inter-
fraternity athletics will govern this
tournament. -

At the same time the interfrater-
nlty_ athleti_c committee reveals the
Tennis Tournament rules:

.1. Aneligibility list consisting of
not more than four names must be
turned into the office of the Dean of
Men on Thursday, May 8. Any addi-
tions to the list must be turned in
one week before the match in which
the student is to participate.

"2. Should an ineligible player
pa‘rt.ici-pate in any matches his fra-
ternity will automatically be dropped

from the tournament.

3. A complete match shall con-
sist of two singles and one doubles
matcll and the winner (of the com-
plete match) is determined when two
of threeindividual matches are won
by either ‘fraternity. The winning
fraternity shall then advance in‘
tournament standing.

_4.. By, the next day after each
match, a representative of the win-
ning team, shall personally submit to
the office of the Dean of Men a list
of the contestants, scores, etc.

5. The committee on interfra-
ternity athletics has power to decide
any question that may arise concern-
ing these rules. .

The committee on interfraternity
athletics is composed of Milton Co-.
hen, chalrman, selected by. the inter-
fraternlty council; W. Arthur
George, Edward Jacobs and Nathan
Schupper.

Announce Future Matches

‘Next Tuesday, S. A.  plays the
winner of the Kappa N u-Lambda Chi‘
Alpha contest and Pi Lambda Phi
meets Phi .Gamma,Delta. On the
next day, winners of the Sigma Chi-
Phi Delta Theta and Sigma Pi- Phi
Ep Pl_games cross rackets. At the
same time the winners of the Omega

- Delta-Theta Chi and Delta. Tau Del-

ta-Kappa Sigma matches cross shots.
The ‘twentieth sees the best eight
teams playing, and the semi-finals
come off on the twenty-third, leav-
1ng.the_ﬁnals for the ‘twenty-sixth.

;'l'he mterfraternity council will
glye the cup which will be emblem-

first year that ten s has been played
by the Greeks, it being on the sched-
ule to bring a closer feeling among
the. fraternity men. Bowling was also
played_for the first time last fall.
According to Cohen, track — and.

Swetonic G... Up Electrical
Engineering Because Of
Small Amount ‘of Pay

 

By S. ZOLA HELLER

Pitt is certainly sending‘ its share I
of successful men ‘into this world. .

In the ‘movies, it’s Regis Toorney;_' in
the Department of the Treasury, it’s
Andy Mellon; and in the big leagues,
as far as the’ Pirates are concerned,
it’s “North Side” S_teve"Swetonic.

The quiet, retiring Steve was a stu-
dent at the University during 1922-
1926. He attended the Electrical En-
gineering -school and got ‘his sheep-
skin in 26. The North Side Pirate
was not affiliated with any fratern-
ity while he was absorbing ‘knowl-
edge at’? this seat of‘ learning. .

‘It was due ‘to the fortunes of the
economic curves that baseball got
this valuable fellow into itsranks.
According to Steve, ’
couldn’t' get more than a hundred

and ﬁfty a montl1,.I decided to take.

a try at baseball and accepted »a
contract which thelndianapolis club
offered me.”

~ Started As ' Inﬂelder

. Before he attended. the University,
however, Steve spent _his grammar
school days at the Horace Mann pub-
lic school on the North Side. Itvwas
there that his ﬁrst real lessons in
baseball were learned. He saw inﬁeld
duty there. This accounts in part for
Steve’s ability to handle the apple
in the ﬁeld. When he went to Alle-
gheny high school, he. decided to try
his hand, or rather arm, at pitching.
And what a pitcher he turned out to
be.TDuring his three years of varsity
pitching, he hurled his team to three
W. P. I. A. L. championships. Two
of the championship games, were
held at the‘ Tech ﬁeld, and the third

was held at the ‘pa_1jk_ where Steve, ,

was later to
Forbes Field.
Charleroi and another. team at the
Tech playground. The other team
Steve just ,couldn’t, remember. The
North Side high-school aggregation
took over the best Washington high
could send on to _Forbes Field.
Then the slim, blond chap came
to Pitt‘ to study and to get in a
few more» licks at baseball. Steve
remembers what a good freshman
squad the school had then. In his
soph_ year, he came out and made the
varsity team as first-string pitcher.

tercollegiate sport, so Steve devoted A

himself to studying. But after he
had gotten out of school, he decided
that his baseball ability was more
valuable to him than his knowledge
of electrical engineering. In '27, he
accepted the Indianapolis contract,
and in ’28 he continued his pitching
for the Hoosiers. In the fall, large-
ly because of his ﬁne work, the

Hoosiers played in the “little world
series” against Rochester of the In-
ternational League. He was chosen
to twirl the -first game and took the
Rochester boys for a fall; In the
series, the Pitt man won three of
his team’s' four ‘triumphs. .

At that time, Donie Bush imme-
diately saw Steve’s possibilities. He
induced. Barney Dreyfuss, / without
mucheffort, to get the Hoosiers to
part with their valuable boxman. In
’29 Steve went with the Bucs to
Paso Robles, California, for spring
training.qIn his early work, he im-
pressed Bush so much that he was
carried with the team for the entire
season. Because of the_ weather
which did not agree with him, he
contracted the flu which hung on
until the late summer. After he had
thrown ‘oil? the effects of the sick-
ness, he developed a blister on his
pitching ﬁnger which bothered him
considerably and kept him from go-
ing ninevinnings during a champion-
ship game. ’ ‘

In Six Games This Y... ,

This year, Steve has avoided all
these _)lnx‘es andseems destined to
show what he really can do. Of the

twelve games won by the Frceboot-

 the North Side fellow has been
responsible for’ ﬁve of them although
the oificial record-s give him credit
for only onetriumph. In each of
these games, he has gone to the
mound to -«rescue a fellow-slabman
who had encountered difficulty. He

has worked from two tofsix innings,

at times to bring in the game from
a threatening foe. Fred Marberry of
Washington showed the league what
a good relief pitcher could do for a

team when he worked in over ﬁfty
' games

in one season. Steve. ma‘;
pitch in even more games.

Steve is sold on baseball as a col-
lege sport. He told this scribe, “More
college boys go into it every year.
it is aclean game. I certainly was

‘ sorry to see Pitt drop it from their

list of activities. I hope they bring
it back some day although it is
tough to run a college team in a big
town where there is a major league
outﬁt. But it can make good in every

small town where-the people really

appreciate the. college players.”
When your reporter suggested
that Swetonic choose‘ tbe_bcst game
he, ever pitched at" Pitt, he remarked
that he had pitchedgonly, one year
as a varsity inan, but in that year
he defeated ,a good Penn State‘ team

at‘_Braddock, 4-3." It was [the ﬁrst 

Pitt victory -in four years over'State.

Swetonic still makes his home in
Pittsburgh‘, living at'2384 California

RACQUETMEN To
FACE ARMY   AT
  WEST POINT

Panthers Whitewash Carnegie
Tech, Bethany In Duels .

 

 

Two more scalps were added-to
the growing string of victories
earned by the Panther,netme'n‘last

week when the Pitt tennis 

blanked both Bethany and Carnegie
Tech in their settos held in the~itI-
dium. This was the'second'trounc'-P
ing the Bisons received‘ at -the hands
of Capt. Eddie Jacobs and his crew
of wreckers; the first contestfwas
won by a score of 8 to 1, butfthe
stadium match saw the Bethany
racqueteers completely routed to the
tune of 9 to, 0. 4 _

Not long after the Bethany team
deserted the stadium, the Tartan:
advanced on the’ stadium totry to
buck up against the powerful Pitt
aggregation. Again, the Panther
showed his claws, and the Skihon
left the stadium badly scratched
while the Panther remained un-
touched. - .

In both contests, the Pitt‘ men
-showed a marked superiority. So
much so in fact, that theisoectators
were almost bored to death by the
one-sided victories. Captain Eddie
Jacob’s cannily placed drives and
smashes had his opponents, running
wild, and his matches were all won
with consummate ease. Mort Bak-
er, Milt Cohen and Goodinanﬁtll
gave» an excellent brand of tennis
to ‘easily outpoint their opponents.
Dave O’Laughl.in didn’t even "bother
to remove his sweater in -his
matches. -

From the present indications, it
looks as though the old» Army..Mule
is in fora scratchingthis Saturday
when the Panther, with its unusual-
ly sharp claws, tangles with it. The
Pitt team is conﬁdent of a victory.

After the Army contest, the 1-ac-"
return home’, and then
they visit the Tartan courts for-their
second match. On May 21, the
George Washington University A
brings what is probably the ‘best
squad on the schedule, with the‘, ex-
ception of California, to the. bowl to
test the Pitt aggregation. ' V
