SGB--Elect Members Offer Variety, inexperience

By SUE McFARLAN D
and
MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writers

Last week, undergraduates went
to the polls to elect six new Student
Government Board members and a
president.

Stan Galanski, the only candi-
date in the entire race with any
experience as a board member,
Was elected to the presidency by a
margin of sixty votes over his
opponent Drew DiMaccio.

Rita Cordisco, Cindy DeMatteo,
Helen Gianella, Tom Kunkel, Todd
Park and Kim Wattersoii were

elected to positions as board
members.

Interviews were conducted re-
cently with the newly-elected
candidates.

Todd Park, who based part of his
campaign platform on his exper-
ience with SGB as chairman of its
Public and Governmental Relations
Committee, said his involvement
with the committee does not mean
he knows all he needs to know
about SGB.

‘ ‘I have to get oriented to SGB in
some respects,” he said. “Within
the month before we take office, a

lot of problems can be worked
out.”

Park added meetings will be held
between elected and present board
members to orient the elected to
their jobs.

Although most of his time will be
ﬁlled with work related to his job as
a board member, Park said he will
continue his involvement with the
Public and Governmental Relations
Committee.

“I’ll still be going to meetings
every week. In respects, l’ll still be
a member except I won’t be able to
vote,” Park stated.

Helen Gianella, present chair-

Tom Kunkel

man of the board’s Commuter
Affairs Committee, said she
believed that experience would
help orient her to her new role as a
board member.

‘‘I know the basics, like the
allocations process. Plus I hope my
experience with commuter affairs
will bring that perspective to the
board, ’ " Gianella said.

In regard to those elected
without any experience with board
functions, Gianella added:

“T hat"s where Stan (Galanski) is
going to have to work. We will be
starting this week to orient people

Todd Park

and find out what they know and
what they don’t know.”

Although she said she was
pleased to see four women elected
to the upcoming board, Gianella
said she doesn’t believe a
two-thirds, female majority will
significantly effect the board in any
way. I

“You work as individuals, not as
males and females,” she said.

Gianella also said she was glad to
see the referendum on the board’s
constitution passed.

“I like the new constitution. It’s H
Amore specific, and with two more

HARRISBURG--Dr. Gordon
Macleod, a University of Pitts-
burgh professor and a pioneer
in health care administration,
was named yesterday as Gov.
Dick Thornburgh’s choice to
head the state Health Depart-
ment.

If conﬁrmed by the state
Senate, Macleod would be in

A charge of planning and coord-
inating all health resources in

the state. Under pending
salary scales, he would be -paid
$46,500 a- year.

His nomination leaves two
cabinet posts still vacant-the
Department of Labor _ and
Industry and the new Depart-
ment of Aging.

Macleod, 50, has served
since 1974 as professor and
chairman of Pitt’s health
services administration in the
graduate school of public

health.

While teaching at Yale, he
was a pioneer in the concept of
health maintenance organiza-
tions (HMOs). From 1971 to
1973, he established and was
the first director of the HMO
Service of the U .S. Department
of Health, Education and
Welfare. '

Under Macleod, the number
of HMOs in the nation.
increased from less than 40 to

more than 130.

He is an avid cross-country
skier, has a degree in chemist-
ry and once worked as an
industrial engineer. ‘He grad-
uated from the University of
Cincinatti’s college of medicine
in 1960 and was a resident at
Massachusetts General Hosp-
ital .

7 Macleod would succeed Dr.
Leonard Bachman, an activist

noted for his advocacy against

smoking and drinking.
“There will be a difference
in style. One of the basic
differences is Bachman was a
politician. ‘He was very visible.
That’s not exactly my style,”
Macleod said in a telephone

, interview.

But he added that he is
concerned with prevention,
health care and self-education.

Fred’ Fonseca, director of the
Office of Residence Life, outlined
added residence hall security
measures before members of the

A Student Affairs Advisory Commit-

tee yesterday.

“As a result of the murder that
occurred earlier this month, we are
not prepared’ to say that ‘there has
been a breech of security,”
Fonseca said, “But security is
something that we can definitely
take a look at.”

Fonseca said ‘that since the
murder of Monica Renee Jones, the
laundry room hours in the Towers
have been restricted to between 8
a.m. and 8 p.m. These hours have
been instituted to coincide with the
hours that the elevators in the
Towers are in operation to the

regulations will

ground ﬂoor where the laundry
room is located.

Two additional policemen were
also stationed in the main Towers
lobby in the weeks followingiithe
murder. Fonseca reported that
beginning today one of these
policemen will be removed from
duty in the lobby.

“In the future, my office will be
taking a much more stringent stand
with residence hall security,”
Fonseca said. “We’ve had entirely
too many students dismantling
security doors, kicking in elevators
and refusing to sign in guests.”

Fonseca said that failure to
comply with any of the security
result in a
summons being sent to the student
to appear before the Judicial
Board.

Fonseca cited some long range
plans for increasing residence hall
security such as relocating the

'laundry room and reducing the

present open visitation policy in the
Towers to 24 hour security‘. He also
cited the possibility of instituting
single sex residence halls that
would give the students the chance

to make the choice of living in a

single sex or coed building.

Terry Milani, associate director
of the Office of Student Activities
reported on the status of the Pitt
Union Program Council and efforts.
made by his office to restructure
the council.

Milani said that 75 students have
applied for positions with the
program council, many of which
are interested in chairman posi-
tions.

Chancellor Posvar announced early last term
that enrollment at Pitt had declined and his plan-
ning document, presented to Senate Council,
predicted a significant drop in enrollment in the
1980's. The Chancellor called the decrease a
“demographic trend." One Pitt student, Jerry
Miller, disagrees completely. In a long and
engrossing letter, Miller calls the drop in
enrollment a reaction ‘against an interior
education, where research reigns over teaching
and a “country club” atmosphere prevails-

terroristic treats, attempting to
incite a riot and resisting arrest.

According to police reports, May
resisted a routine search and called
for friends standing nearby to help
him.

Scillo said May told him
“officers beat him with a club,”
which resulted in May’s admission
to Presbyterian Hospital Sunday
night.

May was released Tuesday after
being treated by an orthopedic

In the only contested vote of the

“I am very happy with the

night. “I can understand how

only way for him to be sure that the

DeMatteo, who was very con-

percent of Pitt’s undergraduate
population. _

Kim Watterson, a former mem-
ber of the Senate Committee on
Student Affairs, was concerned
about the allocations process and
will pursue her interest in that
area.

‘ ‘I think we should make our best
efforts to inform the students about
the allocations process,” Watter-
son said. “We should also try to
generate as much enthusiasm as
possible among the students.”

Rita Cordisco, a junior, brought
in the second highest number of
votes, following Todd Park.

Cordisco also expressed concern
for informing the students about
the allocations process and about
student government in general.

“I want to let the students know
what student government is all
about,” Cordisco said. J

Cordisco was also concerned
with the future of the Pitt Union
Program’Council during her
campaign. She said that, at this
point, it would be premature to
make any suggestions on restruc-
turing the council.

Tom Kunkel, a sophomore, also *

expressed concerns about the role
of the commuter in the University.
Kunkel will continue his support
for the commuter.

“I was really happy with the
results of the election,” Kunkel
said. “Last year I really didn’t
know any of the board members
but this year it seems as though
we’re all just a bunch of students
trying to do a good job.”

Federal Grants Available

Now is the time to apply for both a state or federal grant
to help pay college, trade, business or nursing school costs.

According to the Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance agency (PHEAA), the chances of receiving aid
are greater if students apply early.

Using the combined federal-state form provided by
PHEAA, students can apply any time from now until May 1
if they plan to enter baccalaureate degree programs. This
includes two-year transfer programs at Pennsylvania
community colleges as well as those who seek renewal of
the state grant they hold this year. Students who are first
time applicants for business,‘ trade and nursing schools and
other two-year terminal programs have until Aug. 1 to

apply-

“We require certain financial data for completion of the
application,” said PHEAA executive director Kenneth R.
Reeher, “including the 1978 earnings of the family. That
information should now be available to families so they can
complete and file their application for state aid to go to
school next fall, and they should do it now.”

State grant applicants have a better chance of receive
some state aid at family earnings up to $21,000 and
applicants whose family earnings are as high as $26,000
will find it easier to receive aid. Additionally, under
changes in recent federal law, students, regardless of
income, now can qualify for an interest-free state
guaranteed loan while they are in school.

If a student is interested in a loan, he should use the
form available from a participating lender. These include
banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions.

Students may also request an application by writing

involvement in EPA attempts to clean up the county’s air.

“The meeting will inform local ofﬁcials and active
environmentalists of federal EPA legislation concerning

Forum Features Leakey

Carnegie Institute will present Richard E. Leakey,
anthropologist, in an address entitled, “Exploring Human
Origins,” on Feb. 16 in the Music Hall. '

Leakey, in searching for human origins in Kenya in the
1960’s, discovered a skull of Homo hablis, a species of man
over two million years old. The result of this and other
Leakey findings has extended the history of our ancestry to
more than three million years ago.

Leakey is currently attempting to reconstruct the history
of human evolution. He is director of the National Museum
of Kenya, a trustee for the International Louis Leakey
Memorial Institute for African Pre-history and is chairman
of the Foundation for Research into the Origin of Man.

“ His books include “Origin” and the recently published
People of the Lake,” two works dealing with the
emergence of our species and its future.

 Craig Street Retains Character Despite Changes  

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Forbes Avenue may be swiftly
turning to curb to curb franchises
but Craig Street, anoth ‘.r scene of
constant change, is bringing in
stores of a new sort, specialty
shops in mini-malls.

The mini-mall is a concept
favored by architect Joel H.
Kranich of Joel H. Kranich
Associates, 4600 -Henry St.
Kranich said he believes in using
as much of the existing building as
possible to preserve the atmos-
phere of the neighborhood.

He designed the Gallery shops
on Craig Street, a single building
that houses three import stores
including the Irish Import Center
and The Himalayan Kingdom.
Kranich currently is planning to
renovate four adjacent houses on
Craig Street into a mini-mall to
have 12 shops. Construction will
begin in February.

The mini-mall will be called
Craig Square. Kranich is now
trying to lease the shops.

“It’s going to be very contem-
porary on the inside,” said
Kranich. “There will be balconies
and we will landscape to the curb to
open up the area.”

Kranich said he will use the
same basic ideas on Craig Square
as used on The Gallerv but the new
mini-mall will be finished sooner.
The projected date of completion is
Sept. 10.

“The Gallery Shops were done
piece meal, as rooms became
available,” Kranich said. For this
project, we are doing the whole
thing at one time.”

Kranich said the trend toward
renovating instead of rebuilding is
growing.

“I think there are things of the
past worth keeping. Those
buildings are good, solid struc-
tures. They’re already adapted to
the neighborhood. It’s nice to have
some remaining,” Kranich said.

Kranich said he did not know
exactly when the four houses were
originally built but he estimates
they were constructed in the 1870s.

The response from prospective
shopkeepers wanting to be part of
the new project has begun already.

“I think it’s really going to be
nice,” Kranich said. “We have
had a fairly good mixture of people
interested in Craig Square.”

He said that the mini-mall may
include import stores featuring

deduct the one dollar sitting fee

from the over-all payment.”
Yearbook costs have increased

slightly for 1979--up $1 to $13.

“The actual cost of the book to us
is over $12 per copy, ” Chapman
said. “The other dollar we make
helps us pay for the film. I tried to
keep the increase as low as possible
but we have to keep our head above
water. ”

Chapman said old copies of
yearbooks are still for sale at the
Owl office.

“We have copies from the
1930s,” Chapman said. “The only
year we don’t have is 1977——the
national championship year. I sold
the last copies Monday.” ‘

ducts, as well as a few restaurants.
The smaller shops would offer a
personalized approach and have
‘unique atmospheres.

Kranich said he sees the new

shopping area as a sort of bridge
between the two Oakland univer-
sities, Pitt and Carnegie-Mellon.
“I think it can be a nice area for
students to shop,” Kranich said.
The only reason the quality shop

exists is the need for personal

Craig Street lends itself to the
specialized stores, Kranich said,
because of the uniqueness of th
area. ¢_ ‘

“This is a pretty unusual area in
the city,” Kranich noted. “We
have third generation families
living here. It’s been passed by as
the universities grow around it.”

The whimsical charm Kranich‘
intends to enhance in the stores
should become a welcome respite
to students and residents alike.

“It will offer a diversion from the
university buildings,” he said.

“Planning isn’t just everything
being torn down,” Kranich~ deﬁn-
ed. “It’s not putting a God-awful
front on a building. It’s also

Irish Imports is a specialty shop on Craig Street-the interior is lndividua lized, but outside, the building is basically the
same. Similar shops are planned for the near future.

. Silence
Is Golden

For the “in” crowd at Pitt, the newest and chicest

night spot in Oakland is no longer Peter’s Pub or any .

of the other local watering holes. Hillman Library

now has become the social mecca for hip university"

students. I
No longer do Pitt students bother to walk the

. slushy sidewalks of Forbes and Fifth to reach their

favorite spot where they can mingle and cavort.
Within a block of the residence‘ halls, Hillman
Library has become the place to meet friends and talk
about old times.

By 8 p.m. the scene is hopping on the first floor.
Men with the dry look lean over tables to talk about
Anthro‘ 80 with coed classmates. Others stalk

through the stacks hoping to find a casual acquain-

tance cloistered with their favorite chemistry text-
book. On the fourth floor, someone chatters
amiably with a friend from chemistry class, oblivious
to the burning stares from more ardent students who
are working nearby.

To accommodate the growing crowd of social .

talkers that visit the library nightly, we suggest a few

' renovations to the lowly rooms of Hillman. A bar on

every floor is an absolute essential if Hillman is to

compete with the other night spots in Oakland. How ‘

can the library ever hope to match the Keg or
Danny’s if it never lubricates its patrons with a liberal
flow of alcohol? i

A dance floor could replace the Buhl Collection in
Hillman. From the balconies on the second floor the
more timid of the social scene can have a spectacular‘
view of the swirling dancers below. Who reads about
social work anyway? With a dance floor, there also
must be a sound system and a disc jockey’s booth.
Surely, WPGH can be convinced to help supply this
at a nominal cost.

Of course, Hillman cannot be expected to provide
these new services for free. With a disco and bars
students are going to have to pay to enter the reborn
facilities. Luckily, the library might have an inside
edge when it hires bouncers to man the doors.
Hopefully, the football team can be convinced to

provide this service for the minimum wage. After all, i

the football program has proven to be a strong sup-
porter of H_illman in the past.

For those few who still go to the library to find a
quiet place to study, this change might come as quite
a shock. There seem to be a minority of deluded

souls on campus who actually believe that the library
is supposed to be quiet and people go there to study.

Who cares about these hopeless fools anyway?
Certainly we do not. Why do they think people come
to college? If they want to study, they can find an
empty classroom in the Cathedral. The enlightened
among us here know we are at Pitt only to have a
good time and we demand that we be allowed to use
Hillman to talk as much as we want.

If those few introverted souls who want to study in
the library don’t like it, they can go somewhere else.
Why don’t they try somewhere like Chances R? It
might be quieter.

Piz‘t—Is it? Still z‘hei0ne Minus 1, 000 Students? '  

‘Last year, the news came out
that Pitt’s enrollment was down by
almost 1000 students. Shortly
afterwards, the Chancellor’s plan-
ning document mentioned the
lower enrollment is the result of a
“demographic trend”, that would
be planned for, and the campus
news media downplayed the lower

‘enrollment as something other

schools were experiencing.

. The greatest concern seemed to
be over the ﬁnancial impact, and
neither the administration nor‘ The
Pitt News paid any attention to
possible causative factors of the
enrollment decrease.

I Let us face facts now, shall we?
A decrease from one year to the
next of 1000 students has nothing
to do with a “demographic trend.”
Such a trend may be coming but it
will not have its impact until well
into the 1980s. The lower enroll-
ment was not an excess of normal
freshmen attrition either. _

These 1000 students who left
were sophomores, juniors. and
seniors. I think they left because
they were fed up with the poor
teaching, confused priorities, rip-
offs and general worsening of the

University that has been building
up for some time.

They said, “I can’t stand it
anymore, I quit.” Students in the
middle of their university education
don’t just up and leave without
good reason. I think these reasons
should be examined.

Some of these reasons are: poor

teaching, ‘too much research, a

huge country-club administration
that wastes student dollars, an

administration that is incompetent.

(e.g. libraries and financial aid),
sky-high tuition and unjust fees.

The quality of teaching at Pitt is
apalling. I have had a few good
instructors, but most have been
inexcusably poor. A major reason
for this seems to be an elitist
philosophy about grades. Somehow
they believe that if the number of
good grades is limited, the quality
of education is high. So they do
whatever they can to limit‘ test
grades. ‘ -

Material on tests will have no
relation to what was covered in
class or in the textbook. Material
will be tested that was not touched
on in lectures and not touched on in
the books. Also, huge segments of

whatwas covered will simply be
omitted on tests.
Another tactic to limit grades is

the use of dirty tricks on tests:

multiple choice true-false questions
of a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-
you-don’t nature, where you could
be wrong either way; testing for
material that is ahead of what was
assigned or announced for a test;
essay questions that ask a very
general question and then are

graded "against a very specific, '

rearranged way of thinking.
These dirty tricks do produce the
desired spread of ‘ grades with its
bell-shaped curve, but that spread
does not really reﬂect what was
learned or not learned by students.
Tests are simply invalid. They do
not measure knowledge, and-that is
what is-so frustrating. All too often
a student will know the material

inside and out and yet do poorly in

a course because of bad testing.
Another tactic (that Chem 11 and

12 students are all to familiar with) -

is making a course so impossibly
difﬁcult that everyone does poorly.
Then a curve is drawn up to show a
bell-shaped distribution of grades.
This allows a teacher to get away

.3)’

with teaching so badly that one
learns nothing, but also it’s bad
because even the “Good” students
with the “good” grades often have
‘not learned anything.

This curve system of grading-
otherwise known as the band-aid
approach to incompetent teach-
ing—is criminally unfair. It seems
there are no standards for learning
or teaching other than producing
the bell-shaped curve. An instruc-
tor can make a course and exams as
difficult as he wants and fail as
many students as he wants.
Unclear lectures, poor teaching
methods, dirty tricks on exams,‘
tests that go beyond the scope of
what was expected to be learned

and the competition mentality, all

cheat the student.

Too often you have to repeat a
course just to get a good grade in it.
Taking courses becomes a game of
ﬁnding the right instructor, dis-
regarding trying to learn and
“playing the game,” because
teachers can ’t teach. I did not come
here to play games. I came to learn.

The truth is most students can
get As, Bs——and a few Cs—in their

entire college career if the teaching ’

were decent. Look at community
colleges. Some» competition-
mentality proponents even say
there is grade inﬂation at Pitt. In a
good school, good grades are
earned by students who are more
prepared than ever to learn and to
get good grades.

So what if everyone learns? That
is what we are here for (and paying
for). Grades should reﬂect learn-
ing. Too often at Pitt, grades don’t

reﬂect what was learned. This is

‘especially true in the sciences. One

thousand students didn’t think
there was grade inﬂation at Pitt.

The fact is that most instructors
really don’t want to teach. All they
want to do is research. They teach
because they’re made to, and it
shows. Most regard teaching as a
nuisance that gets in the way of
their precious research. There is no
excuse for the often rude, arrogant
and even vicious attitude of
instructors toward students, espec-
ially undergraduates.

There is too much research at
Pitt. This may offend some
researchers but “offended” does
not describe how I feel when some
instructor rudely and arrogantly
refuses to answer asimple question
after class because hewants to go
back to his lab.

Yet, I still hear it said that Pitt
gives you a‘ iﬁrst‘-class education.
Again, let’s face facts. Commun-
icating knowledge is a skillful job.
But it is a well-known fact that
Pitt’s instructors cannot, or worse,
will not teach well.

Most instructors don’t have the
proper time to teach because of
their research. A defense is that
the best researchers make the best
instructors on the grounds that
they’re up on the latest in their
field, but how good are these
teacher-researchers really? What
good is knowledge if you can’t
communicate it? I ,

Has all this research at Pitt really
helped the education here? The
answer is no. It has hurt it. It is also

good teachers because it assumes
what they were hired for. their area
of expertise—research—automat-
ically makes them good in another
skill altogether—teaching. We
have seen just the reverse is true.

Clearly. teaching at Pitt is
second rate. The reputation Pitt
pursued by recruiting famous
researchers actually is going down
because these researchers can’t
teach. I speak especially for the
sciences but I think it’s university

‘ wide. One thousand students—and

most of the remaining ones, I’m
sure—don’t think Pitt’s education
is “first class.”

Why do 1000‘ students leave?)

Because, disturbingly, all indica-
tions are that Pitt is getting worse.
All feedback mechanisms for
regulating the quality of teaching
have been destroyed. There is no
real, effective feedback mechanism
for improving or removing a_ bad
instructor. The Undergraduate
Academic Review is a joke.
Instructors whose ‘primary concern
is research are free to teach any
way they want with no control.
With no feedback, how can there
be improvement? In nature, those
that fail to adapt die out. _ ,
And the administration s
answer to the teaching-vys.-re
search problem? You guessed
it—more emphasis on research.
Important appointees to education-
al posts have made research their
main concern. And the education.
gets worse, without apparent
concern. The priorities seem to be
research, administration, getting

money, giving corporations a,

“piece of the pie,” (e.g. library
copying machines, Pitt bookstore)
and lastly, students.

Pitt’s Learning Skills Center is
fine for those who really need its
services, but what Pitt really needs
is a teaching skills center. I believe
that after four years students at Pitt
know less than students graduating
from other colleges. I’ve had a
couple of courses where I’ve
learned actually nothing.

Why do 1000 students leave?
Because you have to take halt your
classes twice to get a good grade in
them. Because some chemistry
courses are designed to give F or D
grades to the majority of students.
(And I’ve been told I this by
surprisingly high soiirces). That’s
malicious intent.

Why do 1000 students leave?
Because you pay high tuition and
are thrown into classes with 300 or

more students in them and a
professor who can't teach. I had
one class taught by television
screen.

Pitt’s huge country-club admin-
istration continues to grow. Direct-
ors, assistant directors, business
advisors——the list goes on. Just
look in the University phone book
and you will see positions like
“News Bureau Representative of
the Health Professions," or “Exec-
utive Assistant to the Provost”
(one of eight special assistants), or
“Parking Administration Adminis-
trator.”

What do all these ofﬁcials do?

some almost functionless adminis-
trator. $1500? A week and a half
for some nobody. That’s where the
money goes. 2

Why do 1000 students leave?
Because the sky-high tuition is
what goes to pay for this ‘luxurious,
padded country-club administra-
tion. Pitt's tuition is one of the
highest in the country for a
state-related school. It may
surprise you to know that the
out-of-state tuition at some very
good schools is only slightly more
than the in-state tuition at Pitt. Or
for Pitt’s out-of-state tuition alone,
you can pay out-of-state tuition

man, whose secretary will tell you
that you have to pay it anyway.

Financial aid is another area of
incompetency—red tape, delays
and hassles. Some students’ ﬁles
are actually lost. And grants and
loansware never automatically
deleted from your tuition bill as in
other schools. It’s run there, get
this form, wait here. This is
chronic. I’m sure these incompe-
tencies are a factor in 1000 students
leaving.

There is no “budget crisis” at
Pitt. Pitt gets plenty of money from
the state‘, charges very high tuition
and fees, and has other income.

Next to nothing, literally. It’s
doubly enraging because they are
not connected with any real,
meaningful work, and because they
are paid so very highly. And the
money to pay for it is often so
hard-earned. All the directors with
their assistants, advisors, secretar-
ies, luxurious offices and expense
accounts are an enormous drain on
the University—A drain financial-
ly, a drain of resources and a waste
of potential benefits to students.
What are the salaries of these
do - nothing administrators?
Twenty, thirty, fourty, up to sixty
thousand a year or more. That’s
$1000 a week. For doing nothing.
How much is tuition? $750?
Maybe that is one week’s salary for

plus room and board at some very
good schools. ,

And then there are are the fees
at Pitt. Late fees, reinstatement
fees, physical education fees, a fee
for changing from part-time to
full-time or vica versa. These fees
are unjust. There is no basis for
most of them. I can see having an
incentive for paying tuition on
time, for example? but Pitt
demands full payment usually
before the term begins (which most
schools don’t) and smacks you with
a $25 late fee if you don’t pay on
time. Twenty-fivo dollars is a lot of
money to a student. And there’s
nothing you can do about it except
complain to the director of unjust
late fee complaints, the ombuds-

There is a “crisis” in the form of
second-rate education, reversed
priorities, a gigantic wasteful
administration and ‘poor attitudes
toward students. I am sure the
waste at Pitt is millions of dollars a
year. I cannot understand the
foolishness of lobbying for more
state money. Pitt’s budget is about
200 million dollars. That’s a ﬁfth of
a billion dollars a year. .

And then there are the almighty -

graduate schools. . Graduate
courses are better taught, the
minimum QPA for grad school is
3.0 and these grades are practically
given away, compared to under-
graduate courses. The grading
standards are just shifted a whole
level upward.

Finally, you may wonder how I
know why 1000 students left. I
know because I was almost one of
them. I looked for another school
to attend but couldn’t find one in
time and decided to stay at Pitt.
I’m sure many more are thinking of
leaving.

Pitt can be made into a better
school. Indiana University (Pa.),
for example, has much lower
tuition, smaller classes, a concise,
effective administration that cares
about students; interesting classes
and instructors who are eager to
and capable of teaching. Imagine
it: smaller classes, fair, quality
standards of education that can be
met. Imagine having the prestige

of going to a school just because‘

the instruction is so good.

But Pitt will not get better under I

Pitt’s current leadership. The
decline of Pitt is alarming. In the
one and a half years that I’ve been
at Pitt I’ve noticed a marked
decline in its overall quality. And it
just seems to be getting worse.

I believe a state takeover is the
only solution that will work. Some
students—and to a certain extent
The Pitt News, ' too-—-bury their
head in the sand and pretend Pitt’s
real problems don’t exist or will go
away or be solved by others.

This is not true and sets a
dangerous pattern—if you don’t act
now, when will you? You set a
pattern now for the rest of your life.
The Pitt News is guilty of evading
these real issues in the ways’ of
ignoring, dismissing, and ration-
alizing; its increased politicaliza-
tion (a sometimes response to
helplessness), and, by “The
Sentinel” comic strip.

You don’t have to look too deeply
to see that problems in “The
Sentinel” are Pitt problems.
Fantasy superhuman reactions to
disguised university problems will
not solve this school’s real
troubles. I

Solving Pitt’s real problems may
not be easy but there are solutions
and they can be achieved by
working together. Look at Iran.
They did it. And these lessons can
be well-learned. I hope students
and The Pitt News will take a more
direct, action-oriented approach to
our real problems instead of trying
to put them out of mind or
subliming them into comic strips or
the exaggerated importance of the

‘The Wiz’ is a Whiz of a Screen Musical    

By CELIA HILDEBRAND
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Wiz
Directed by Sidnet Lumet
Warner Theater

The screen version of ‘ ‘The Wiz’ ’

is one of the most delightful

, musicals to be adapted from the
stage in recent years.

In this modiﬁed version of “The

Wizard of Oz,” Diana Ross

portrays Dorothy, a remarkably
naive 24-year-old kindergarten
teacher. Ross oozes with sweetness
but her musical numbers are
excellent. She performs with
feeling that verges on genius.

In supporting roles, only Mabel
King asithe Wicked Witch of the
West, and Ted Ross, as the
Cowardly Lion, matched Ross. The
two upstaged the famous names in
the cast with their comic por-

trayals.

Richard Pryor, in the title role,
fought a losing battle with his
satiric image. Nipsy Russell was
creative as the Tin Man, but his
debut as‘, a singer was not
spectacular.

Michael Jackson, youngest of
The Jackson Five, portrayed the
Scarecrow. His vocals were fine
and his dance numbers were
perfect. Unfortunately, his acting

didn’t match up.

The problem with “The Wiz” is
the inevitable comparisons with the
1939 screen classic “The Wizard of
Oz” and the fact that it is a light
ﬁlm not to be judged by the same

criteria as a picture that has a i

strong screenplay.

On the plus side, “The Wiz”
manages to level some good jabs at
today’s society. The Wicked Witch
is a commissioner, a golden apple

rises over Emerald City, and
there’s an attack at the world of
fashion—the trend of wearing the
newest most obnoxious clothes to
please the Diors and Halstons.
Halston, incidentally, designed the
costumes which are among the
most unique to hit the screen since
“Star Wars.”

“The Wiz” is a fun picture-
light hearted and fast and meant
for a good time.

GrammyAwards Trudge Down Middle-of-Road

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

Pitt News Staff Writer

This column will address itself to the celebrated sham
known as The Grammy Awards.

Recently I was reading “Billboard” magazine and
learned of the nominations for Grammys this year. To put
it bluntly, I was appalled.

I quote: “The Rolling’Stones and Jackson Browne got
the first Grammy nominations of their long careers...."

I am not a Stones fan, but I think I have captured a lot of
their sentiment when I say, “It’s about time.”

I seem to recall the Beatles not receiving a Grammy for
Song of the Year until the late 1960s, practically at the end
of their career. ‘

What I am getting at is this: I think it’s pretty disgusting
when a group of old men (and a few women) can select who

vthey feel should win awards, not who most of America feel

should win.

The examples I've mentioned are just a few, but they
illustrate my point. “Dark Side of the Moon,” by Pink
Floyd, is still on the “Billboard” charts, despite its age (it
was released in 1972), but it has never received a Grammy.
Or what about Bob Seger’s “Night Moves,” or Bruce
Springsteen’s “Born to Run,” both of which scored high in
critics’ minds, but which, along with Warren Zevon, were
ignored this year for their recent releases. Or what about
Steely Dan’s “Aja?”

There is one bright spot here: the nominations of The
Cars and Elvis Costello in the New Group category.

I cannot express the frustration a rock listener and critic
like myself goes through whenever I watch this show.
Clearly, I must not be the only person who feels this way,
as several other rock awards shows have sprung up. over

the years, notably the American Music Awards and the
Billboard awards. So some fair recognition is being given
out at least.

Some of the other artists who have been passed up
include Billy Joel for “52nd Street,” because the album
was released too late to be eligible for consideration and
the Whowith their new release, “Who Are You,” (for
whatever reasons the nominatorsicould dream up).

This situation is somewhat analogous to The Academy

Awards, which snubbed the “Saturday Night Fever" »

soundtrack last year.

There is only one way to solve this problem, and that’s to
boycott watching the show. Don’t watch it. Write to those
individuals/ corporations who cause it to be telecast.

If you’re as sick as I am of watching your favorite artists
and albums getting passed over, then it’s really the only
thing (besides complain) that you can do.

‘Lauren Becall: By Myself’

Bacall Recalls Years with Bogart in Book

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Entertainment Editor
Lauren Bacall: By Myself
By Lauren Bacall

Books about movie stars line
countless library and bookstore
shelves. Most should stay there
untouched. “Lauren Bacall: By
Myself” is an exception. It’s a
perceptive and honest book without
pretensions--exactly like Bacall
herself.

Bacall was a New York fashion
model when her photo was spotted
by the wife of ﬁlm director Howard
Hawks. Hawks was searching for
an ingenue to play opposite
Humphrey Bogart in “To Have and
Have Not.”

It all happened like a typical
Hollywood screenplay: Bacall got

the part and Bogart, too. They had
a happy and successful marriage,
but it ended tragically in 1957 when
Bogart died of throat cancer.
Widowed with two children, Bacall

Anyone looking for some of the
old 10cc magic,‘ lacking from the
band’s recent releases, will certain-
ly not find it in this album.

synthesizer) and going off to record

acted like a perfect rat,” Bacall
recalled.

And there was an unsuccessful
marriage to Broadway actor Jason
Robards—“I knew how far I could

Finally, Bacall made a triumph-

three-record waste of vinyl titled
“Consequences.” The chief
problem with this album was the
cost-—at $21, it was no bargain. It
was jammed with ﬁller, most
notably a long monologue by a
British A comedian and lots of
long-winded instrumentation.
There were a few bright moments
in this release, however.

In “L,” their newest release, the

artists have limited themselves to a
much more reasonable two sides.
As in “Consequences,” how-
ever, the lyrics suffer, for the only
purpose of this album seems to be
to showcase the Gizmo’s talents
and to prove that Godley and
Creme know more than just what a
recording studio looks like.

Despite the difficult times she
went through, Bacall shows no self

Sinatra she describes with com-
passion—“People said he looked
like ‘Bogie but I never saw the
resemblance. Even now.”

The most fascinating part of “By
Myself” is Bacall’s description of
life with Bogart. Bogart special-
ized in the tough-guy roles, yet he
was a sentimental and devoted
husband. After his death, Bacall
discusses the growth of the Bogart
cult, and her problems of dealing
with it as she tried to hold together
her marriage to Robards--“Every-

Bacall has a sense of humor, too.
She rises above her failures both
personally and, professionally.

When asked why Bacall rarely
left the house during his illness,
Bogart said, “She's my nurse and
my wife and she stays home.
Maybe that’s how you separate the
ladies from the broads in this
town.”

Bacall is still deserving of the
compliment.

material here, which is good in a
way. The problem is that there is
also no FM material here either,
except for FM progressive radio-
something that is almost impos-
sible to find.

Several songs are at least
listenable, including “This Sport-
ing Life,” a rather sardonic remark
on business that would work a lot
better if the middle wasn’t
overloaded with garbage. “Group
Life” features a nice refrain from
“Donna,” a song from the ﬁrst
10cc LP. “Art School Cantine” is a
rather arty piece with an idiotic
rhyme scheme.

Creme and Godley have dis-
played a good use of studio
technique here, much to the
l_istener’s discomfort. They are
very versatile at playing all sorts of
instruments, but their writing
talents are pretty poor. After
listening to this, it’s obvious where

the talent went when 10cc split '

up———and it didn’t go here.

  Panthers Must Gun Dow B.B., Duquesne

Pitt Tries For Second
Straight in Eastern 8

By SAMUEL SCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer

College basketball’s version of
the Pitt-Penn State football game
takes place tomorrow night when
the Panthers meet the Dukes of
Duquesne in an important Eastern
Eight game.

Pitt is 9-8 overall and 2-2 in
league play, while the Dukes are
10-6 and 1-3 under ﬁrst year coach,
Mike Rice.

Panther fans should not be
misled by Duquesne’s loss to Penn
State last week. With the possible
exception of Syracuse, Duquesne is
probably the most talented team
Pitt will have played to date.

Pitt’s downtown neighbors are
paced by guard “B.B.” Flenory, a
ﬂashy junior who averages 21-
points a game. But he has failed to
reach double ﬁgures in Duquesne’s
last two games, a loss to Rutgers
and a come-from-behind win over
Oral Roberts.

The big news at Duquesne this
year has been the play of two
freshmen forwards, Doug Arnold
and Bruce Atkins, who stand six
foot, nine inches and six foot, seven
inches, respectively. Atkins is
currently third in the Eastern Eight
ﬁeld goal percentage race and
holds the same position in
rebounding- Pitt’s Sam Clancy is
first in the rebounding war.
However, Duquesne’s stalwart, is
center John Moore, a 6 foot, 6 inch
junior who can score and rebound
with equal proﬁciency. Coach Rice
has alternated Jeff Baldwin and
Ronnie Dixon at the shooting guard
position. Baldwin's long range
gunning was instrumental in the
Dukes’ 68-67 victory over ORU
Monday.

Pitt enters the game riding on

the crest of a two-game winning.

streak. Coach Tim Grgurich seems
to have settled on a set starting
lineup: Clancy, Sammie Ellis,
Terry Knight, Wayne Williams and
Carlton Neverson.

The first two men off the bench
are Pete Strickland and Dave
Olinger. The Panthers must try to
stay out of foul trouble, particularly
up front, where there is no depth.

A Pitt victory at the Civic Arena
tomorrow would be a tremendous
boost to its hopes for gaining the
home court advantage in the first
round of the Eastern Eight
Tournament in four weeks. A loss
by the Dukes would put them two
full games behind Pitt in the
standings and leave them dangling
close to Penn State and Massachu-
setts at the bottom of the league
heap.

The Panthers want this win very
much because it would give them a
full "head of steam entering
Saturday night’s rematch with the
West Virginia Mountaineers at the
Field House. A victory then would
push Pitt past WVU into third place
behind Villanova and Rutgers.

The Pitt-Duquesne rivalry is one
of the most spirited in basketball
today, in spite of the fact that the
teams did not play each other on a
regular basis until two years ago.
Duquesne leads the all-time series
24-14, while Pitt has won two of the
last three games between the two
teams.

In the preliminary game at 6
p.m., a team of former Pitt players
will battle a Duquesne alumni
squad. The game is called the Rust
Bowl, probably as a tribute to the
now defunct Steel Bowl. That
regular season tournament was the

only time Pitt and‘Duquesne met

on the courts.

M Wrestlers Stew (Irish, Fall to Buckeyes at Triangular Meet

ByJIMLEWIS
Pitt News Asst. Sports Editor

COLUMBUS, Ohio—The Pitt
wrestling team split two matches
against Ohio State and Notre Dame
Sunday, crushing the Irish, 35-10,
and falling to the Buckeyes, 20-18,
at St. Johns Arena.

The Panthers had four pins
against helpless Notre Dame, 8-8,
but it was the last bout in the
Pitt-OSU contest that stole the
show. I

With 12 seconds left in the ﬁnal
190-pound match, referee Dennis
Palmer called Panther Pat Connor
for stalling and gave Buckeye Jim
Anderson a 5-4 decision, much to
the home .crowd’s delight.

“I think it was a fair call,” Ohio
State head coach Chris Ford said.
“Pitt wasn’t attacking.”

Pitt head coach Dave Adams
went straight to Palmer after the
match with Ohio State, 8-6, was
over and voiced his opinion.

“I don’t want to comment on the
officiating,” Adams said. “At least
it was an exciting match today.”

The afternoon featured many Pitt
firsts. Connor had his first
collegiate pin against Notre
Dame’s Dave Rodgers at 5:45. Skip
Bolin’s, 167 pounds, had his ﬁrst
loss of the season,‘ 15-8,’ to Ohio
State's Jay Greiner and 167-pound-

  had his first

/2 ‘ .

collegiate voctory, 4-1, over Notre
Dame’s Bill Moore.

The Panthers also earned ﬁve
pins. Besides Connor’s pin, 118-
pounder Glenn Maxwell made two.
He pinned OSU’s Joe Biggs at 2:45
and the Irish’s George Gedney at
5:37. Tom Jones, 158 pounds, had
one against Notre Dame’s Mike
Wilda at 4:50. Heavyweight Steve
Smocharski pinned Notre Dame’s
Jeff Morris (replacing injured
football all-American Bob Golic) at
5:15. ’

But Pitt, 4-4, had to settle for a
split.

“Our inexperience showed
through at times,” Adams said.
“Our youthfulness was good in
enthusiasm and aggressiveness,
but it hurt us in a couple of
instances.”

The Panthers had to settle for
three draws against Ohio State.
Jose Martinez and Jeff Woo drew
6-6 in the 126 pound bout. Glen
Nacion and Kelvin Irby were tied,
5-5, in the 134-pound match and
Smocharski and Mark Sullivan
drew, 1-1, in the heavyweight
clash. ’

“Jose just had _a mental lapse,”
Adams said. “He heard the whistle
from the other match going on, and
thought the referee at his match
blew it.,That enabled Woo to take
him down and tie it. -

“With Glen, he got taken down
on a counter move because he
didn’t control the hand. There were
situations where they could have

-won it but didn’t.”

Pitt ﬁnished the day winning 10
of the 20 bouts, while tying in three
bouts.

“Our record doesn’t indicate it
right now.” Adams said. “But we
have a pretty good team. We’ll get
better as the season goes along.”

The Panthers travel to Clarion
State College tonight for_ an
important Eastern Wrestling
League (EWL) match with the

“Our wrestlers have to start
worrying about what they’re going
to do instead of what the opposition
is going to do on the mat,” Adams
said. “At times, the younger
wrestlers worry too much about the

-opposition .

“But I’ll tell you, though. One
of these days our entire lineup will
jell together for a good per-
formance, instead of having a few
guys on and a few guys off. When
that happens, we’ll really destroy
somebody.”

' Pitt Runner Training r A-ca—Iniuri,  

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staffwriter

For the first time ever, Pitt has
an athlete who also serves as his
team’s trainer.

A member of the track team,
junior Bud Cooper tends to his
teammates’ various injuries and
illnesses, and is also a trainer for
the football team.

His is a hectic life, but one at
which Cooper, a health and
physical education major who
specializes in athletic training,
excels. He is a Dean’s List student
and one of Pitt’s top middle
distance runners.

It is a life Cooper enjoys.

“I wouldn’t trade it for any-
thing,”. said Cooper, an active
member of the Fellowship of
Christian Athletes. “I’ve always
enjoyed athletics.

“Being both an athlete and
trainer, I've gotten a new perspec-
tive about how athletics really
works. It’s been interesting and
fun.”

Cooper originally wanted to be a
coach but changed his career plans
in high school when his sister, now
a health teacher in the Philadelphia
area, introduced him to athletic
training.

Cooper plans to continue his
education at either the University
of Arizona or University of Oregon,
two of the few schools which offer a
master’s program in athletic
training. His goal is to be a trainer
for a professional sports team.

For now, however, Cooper has
his mind on more immediate
matters, including making all-

‘America in the mile relay.

“We have an exceptional mile
relay team,” he said. “We have a
very good shot at making the
nationals.”

The mile relay team, which also
includes Larry Shippen, Keith
Leckenby, and Dwayne Defore,
ﬁnished seventh (out of 24 teams)
at an invitational in College Park,
Maryland two weeks ago. It was an
impressive showing, considering
that national powers such as
Villanova, Texas-El Paso and
Tennessee also competed.

Individually, Cooper competes in
both the 600-meter and 440-yard
running events. He has improved
his times in each by about a second
a year.

He now runs the 440 in about 48

seconds and hopes to trim that to
47 before the season is over.

Wednesday, January 31, 1979—Pege_ 13

Runner Bud Cooper not only leads off the mile relay, he sees to his team's training needs as well.

The Pitt’s women's basketball

Penn State this weekend.
Saturday’s match against the
Lady Lions of Penn State found the
Pantherettes on the short end of a
68-56 score with Wanda Randolph
taking game honors with 22 points
and Stephanie Stripling scoring 14.
“With all the injuries, we have
definitely been hurt,” said Bal-
thaser.” But our other players
have risen to the occasion and

regrouped in spite of the injuries.”

“Carol (Dugan) will be starting
with light practice this week but we
are not really sure when she will be
able to play yet, said Balthaser.
“Debbie (Lewis) is out of her cast
but her return is unknown also.”

Recently injured guard Peggy
Dugan may be in uniform if the
Pantherettes are able to reach the
regional playoffs at the end of the
season.

Swimmers Hope to Termin-ate Clarion ~

By KAREN KADILAK
PittNewsStaffWriter .

“Family Affair — swimming
style” would be an appropriate title
for one of the many interesting
individual matchups that will take
place tomorrow when Pitt’s swim-
mers (6-0) meet Clarion.

In an unusual turn of events,
Pitt’s Mickey Termin probably will
face his brother Buddy (of Clarion)
in both the 50 and 100-yard

freestyles. As two of their tea_m’s ‘

top swimmers, both swam last
summer for Pitt’s Amateur Athletic

“Union” (AAU) team, where they

comprised one-half of the relay
team that was ranked 20th in the
world.

Interestingly, two other mem-
bers of that 400—yard freestyle relay
team———Pitt’s Rick Carter and Mark
Schuman—also are expected to
compete in the 50 and 100-yard
freestyles.

“These guys enjoy competing
against one another,” Panther

‘ coach Fred Lewis said. “They have

a lot of fun in the pool when they’re
together.” 1

Other noteworthy matchups will
include Pitt’s Jeff Trew and
C1arion’s John Havlik=-in the 500
and 1,000-yard freestyles and Pitt’s
Bob Clemmer and Jim Huey in the
breaststroke events.

Trew and Havlik,last summer,

.trained together at the Mission

Viejo Swim Club in California.
They were also roommates.

Meanwhile, Clemmer and
Huey—along with Clarion team-
mate Anthony Pagano—competed
for Pitt’s AAU team.

“Pitt and Clarion have what you
would call ‘a friendly rivalry,”’
Lewis said. “A lot of our swimmers
are friends with theirs. As a result,
we know a lot about them and they
know about us. The situation
makes for some very interesting

Last year’s meet was far from
“interesting as Pitt, according to
Lewis, “blew out" the Golden
Eagles at Trees Pool. Although this
time the meet is at Clarion, Pitt
again’ is expected to clobber the
Eagles, which are traditionally one

of the best small college teams in"

the nation.

Lewis looks forward to “some
good swims.” He also expects, his
team to dominate both diving
events, especially now that Panther

Five Qualify For Eastem Regionals
As Women Swimmers Win Pair

By LINDA VENZON
Pitt News Staff Writer

Five freshmen Pantherette
swimmers qualiﬁed for Eastern
regional championships and three
others qualiﬁed for national cham-
pionships as Pitt defeated George
Washington, 106-20, Friday and
Maryland, 87-42, Saturday.

Amy Jackson and Nancy Henry
qualiﬁed for .Easterns in the
50-yard butterﬂy event at George
Washington, helping the Panther-

ettes win every event of the
evening except the one meter
diving competition. Hillary
McBride received half of the
necessary points to make Eastern
qualiﬁcations by winning the three
meter diving event against George
Washington’s previously unbeaten
diver Jeannie Dahnk.

“The swimmers were tired the
night we arrived,” said head coach
Dick Bradshaw, “but it was a good
warm up meet for Maryland.”

Jackson met the national qualifying

points to also qualify for the

season.

fatigue and illness. The Panther-
ettes (6-1) travel to Clarion
tomorrow for an evening meet.
Clarion was the Division II
champion last year and defeated
Pitt, which is in Division. I.

“Clarion really took us by

Bradshaw. “We’re in Division I,
they’re in Division II. I guess we'll
just have to show them that
