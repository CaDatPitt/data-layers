Twelve Cadets

4 Tapped Friday

To Pitt Rifles

Pitt Riﬂes, at their tapping
dance in Cathedral gym Friday
tapped twelve men for

graduate military fraternity.

At 10:30 o’clock, Capt. Dick
Stein-called up the following men
for tapping: J. Angelluzi, R.

~ Barnes, M. Bass, N.'R. Brown,
G. Diddinger, P. Dutch, W.
_Kurtz, R. Reich, A. Sigal, C.
M. Standfest, G. W. Uﬂielman,
and R. L. Vissat.

After the tapping, pledge cap-
tain Ralph Wilde explained the pro-

cedure of hell week, which started

yesterday, and will continue

through Friday.

The pledges are required to be
at school each day from 7:30 until
5 o’clock. The pledge headquarters
is in the basement clothing room.

Strict military discipline is in
order this week. The pledges must
observe all rules of military cour-
tesy and discipline. They will walk
guard duty.

, At the end ‘of the week, the
pledges will be inducted into active
membership in Pitt Riﬂes.

Helen Pool Rush, dean of women,
will have her ofﬁce in the Hostess
room. ‘

Chancellor John G. Bowman,
commenting on Mrs. Miller’.s resig-
nation, praised her work in help-
ing the University move to the
Cathedral from the hill, and spoke
highly, of the Guide service for
visitors which Mrs. Miller organ-
ized, and the friendly gracious at-
mosphere she created through her
Commons room teas.

“Mrs. Miller was a great help
and did a very good job. We are
all very sorry to see her leave,”
the Chancellor remarked during
the interview.

The Hostess oﬁice has been plac-
ed under the direction of the dean
of women. Miss Rush is working
on plans which, although indeﬁ-
nite, seem to indicate that a part-
time hostess may be put in charge
o'f the hostess’ duties. Miss Rush
herself will have her oflice on the
ground floor until plans are com-
pleted. ‘

SFA Poll Shows Students

Nlore Informal, Inexpensive

. A strong majority of University
students want an increase in the
"number of informal and low-cost
dances, and are almost evenly di-
divided on the questions of compul-
Vsory wartime courses and activi-
ties.

This was indicated in a’ cross-
flsection poll conducted last week
inf by the SFA statistics committee,‘
as a part of the program to find
 out what students expect of their

University life during the war.

Spitalny Band to lntroduce
'Promahula Swing’ at Dance

Highlight of the ﬁrst all University summer dance,
“Promahula,” which will be held in the Hotel Schenley, Fri-
day night from 9 to 1 o’clock, will be the introduction of a

new song, “Promahula Swing.”

Written by Jimmy Spitalny,
whose orchestra will play for the
dance, the song is dedicated to the
summer dance, Albert Steinkirch-
ner, C44, publicity manager reveal-
ed today. '

The “Promahula” will be an
informal, no corsage dance limit-
ed to 275 couples. Tickets sell for
1.65 per couple, tax included.
Leis will be given ‘as favors.

Decorations for the affair will
be appropriate to a Hawaiian or
south sea, island with an electric
guitarist to provide the melodies for
the intermission on the outer pavil-
ion of the.Hotel Schenley lawn.

Leonard Bortz, chairman of
the affair, and Barbara Frankel
will lead the dance. There will
be a floor show featuring special
entertainment and the playing of
“Promahula Swing” for the ﬁrst
time.

Tickets may be obtained from
committee members‘ or at the booth
in the ground floor elevator lobby,

John Sheppard, business manager,»

stated.

Blackout Shown
By Seismograph

The complete success of Pitts-
burgh's blackout on Tuesday is
shown by the vertical seismograph

in the University’s seismology sta-
tion in the sub basement.

Rumblings in the earth, even
traffic noises are recorded by sen-
sitive instruments on photo-
graphic plates. Absence of these
recordings showed a complete
state of quiet according to Don-
ald C. Bradford, University seis-
mologist. 1

“Trafﬁc died down to zero in one
minute and picked up again in a

‘ minute after, the all clear sounded.

The vertical seismograph picks up
traffic over a range of several
miles. This is proof that traffic
died down to nothing during the
period of the blackout.”

Desire  
Dances

Both Engineering and Mines stu-

dents and those in the College,
Business Administration, and Edu-
cation were decidedly in favor of
substitution of low-cost dances for
extravagant affairs. Only 31 per
cent of the students taking non-
technical courses believed that one
or two technical courses should,be
required.

The poll was taken by the
sampling method and ballots
were distributed by a committee
of 40 students, who themselves
represented a cross-section of in-
terests.

On the main statistics commit-
tee are De Marco, Harold Gondel-
man, William Saalbach, Richard
Briney, and Helen Dines

Air Raid Plans 
Proved Success  

By Blackout ,

Dr. John J. Geise, associate pro-5.
fessor of history, stated last week,

that he was very much pleased

with the functioning of ‘Pitt's airy
raid system during Tuesday's
blackout. 4

“All of the wardens reported ’
to their stations immediately,
and the entire campus, includ-
ing the Shadyside building, was ‘A
blacked o.ut successfully,” Dr.
Geise said.

Indicating the rapidity of their»
system the sector warden reported}
that the Cathedral was the ﬁrst

large building to be completel
blacked out in"the area. i

Dr. Geise remarked that the en-

tire University air raid organiza-,

tion has been overhauled in the last

three weeks. The shelter areas as

first floor classes have been‘changi--~

ed. Druids, honorary sophomoro
activities fraternity, a’nd Phi Gam-

’ From Hamilton college at Clinton, N-ew
.York,' Dr. Irwin Edman, professor of philos-
ophy at Columbia university, made a predic-
-tion ‘about the effect of the war on education.

The. following article on Dr. Edm'an’s
speech 18 reprinted from last Sunday's New
:York Times: » \

“A prediction that fraternities, winter
carnivals and other trivia would be written
out of American education for good as a
result of the war was made today by Irwin
Edman, Columbia professor and guest lec-
turer at Hamilton college.

Dr. Edman declared that the war was “a
‘good thing for the colleges,” adding that
_ they may even become educational institu-

I tions.”

. “There is a priority on time these days
just as on everything else, and while the
American people are willing to let serious-
minded potential leaders stay in college,.they

i will not put up with youngsters who have no

intellectual interests and who are just in col-
jlege because they have the money and are

-3-"nice boys.”

Dr. Edman predicted increased govern-
. ent aid to keep the best students in col-
lege, indicating that admission to college
might become more a matter of strict civil
service than economic accident. . _

Dr. Edman also asserted that college cur-

 riculums were undoubtedly in for some over-

ihauling, to the end that students would not
be able to obtain a degree without knowing
more about what is needed to keep a democ-

helped the drive going.
ODK has sponsored a letter writing
campaign to men in the armed forces.

Men’s debate association,_ the Pitt band,
Pitt Players, all did ﬁne jobs this summer
with the morale institute.

All this points to but one thing—that the
Universities, spurred by war-time necessity,
are doing what they might have done a long
time ago—“become places of intense effort
and achievement,” to quote a government
ultimatum to America-n colleges.

And the progress made thus far shows
something else too———that the students, told
what they can and must do by intelligent
leaders, will cooperate as best they can.

. The way ‘then, to further progress is

. clear. There must be more suggestions as

to what can be done. These_ can come from

S'FA, from the faculty, the administration,
the students, the News-——£rom anybody.

=|= *

One such suggestion has come fromthe
military department, who rightly protest
students’ indifference to the ﬂag, students
who apparently do not knowrthat they're
supposed to stand and not sprawl on the lawn
when the national emblem passes.

Let -no student who prides himself upon
adherence to convention-—who knows what
coat and which pair of shoes “go” on cam-
pus, who respects and admires any number
of symbols; keys, pins, rings, memberships
in honoraries-—let none such as these ig-
nore what may be considereda symbol of

racy running than they know now.”

And since in the above classiﬁcation may

tion which denies theexpression of an honest

veryone Urging Second Front Is'n't’ A  
ed,A Pink, And / or /«Fellow Traveler

an MAVRINAC -
«It was not my original intention
 ‘my wish to write any more
’’‘9n the question of the second front.
However, certain statements
‘ ade by the Pittsburgh Press edi-
‘ioriallyon August 18 have prompt-
led me to forego these original in-

tentionsf andiwrite against what I’

osider to be either a stupid space-
ﬁller of an editorial or a sly, clever
tempt to destroy a lawful oppo-
gsrtion to the Press policy by in-
‘Sinuations .and implications. , -
illeferring to the demands for
13- .,second front, the Press said,
(there is) “no excuse for the cur-
rent agitation of the Reds, Pinks,
wand fellow-travelers’ in this chun-
gtry.
'.'._.‘.“They are demanding President

gilN,tooseve_lt and Prime Minister

Churchill set up a second front in
Western Europe now.
t7_"‘Never‘mind the practical mili-
tary sense, or lack of it, in at-
tempting an invasion of Europe
‘ow. Never mind the costin Ameri-
‘n or British lives.”

;f[~This lighthouse of ignorance
therefore by implication slyly
‘ roups all proponents of the “Sec-

. ,3
‘end-Front Now” idea into one
gtlass-——Reds. That of ‘course is not

what the editorial says, but that
is certainly what it implies.

j For the sake of the record, it
ﬁight be interesting to point ou-t

.-':(;;1e or two examples of such de-
. fnands for a second—front Now and

scrutinize their source..

’ On July 22, Senator Claude
'-Rapper of Florida spoke before a

' -.‘‘‘Second-Front” Rally in New
:,York, which is probably one of the
Wrallies to which the Press was re-
inferring when it said, “they are de-
imanding it at mass meetings, by
fpostcard pleas to Washington, etc.
 Here is what a United States
Senator told this rally: 4

‘r “We must not, whatever the.

cause, postpone the day of decision
to give effective support to these

., ard-pressed and valiant friends

_ '. Instead of being agitated about
how, let us put our emphasis on
Now.” '

On August 3, in Washington be-
‘ anothe.r=sneh~ rally, the Sen-
5.3

for every defense measure" and
every anti-Axis measure for years,
reiterated his remarks. , I

Is this. man therefore to be

branded and ‘classed as a Red by’

the Pittsburgh Press because he
supports a Second-Front? '
Senator Harry Truman of ,Mis-
souri,-whose primary duty now is
the investigation of the defense ef-
fort, introduced an editorial of the
St. Louis Star-Times into the Con-'
gressional Record of July 23.
“Now if ever a second land-air
front in Europe mustbe establish-

ed in order to keep Russia in -the

ﬁeld throughout‘ this summer,”
said thereditorial. Is Senator Tru-
man to -be classed as a Red because
he had this editorial printed? Is
the man who wrotethat editorial

in the Star-Times to be considered‘

a —-Red ? _

The Press demands in a furth-
er paragraph of the editorial that
all talk of a second-front ‘now
cease and proposes that all “agi-
tators” for such a move expend
their effort to provide the weap-
ons of war.

If we havereached the point, as
the Press seems to think we have,
where a disctission of the issues 6f
the day should ‘cease, because such
a discussion would result in an ex-
penditure‘ of energy which could
be used in making .bul1ets,’then

perhaps the time has come to close
down all radio stations, all lec-
ture halls, and all newspapers.

It is this right of petition, guar-
anteed by the First Amendment to
the Constitution which .. President
Roosevelt in his addressto Con-
gress on the 29th of April, 1939,
heldup as one of the great“ rights
of Americans. In its wisdom, The
Press would grant everyone ‘the

right of petition except Reds, pinks '
and fellow-travellers. and all those,

whose views conﬂict with those of

the Pittsburgh Press.
_ I may disagree with those who

- petition Congress for this or that;
I may oppose their arguments;
but as a citizen of the. United
States I can never suggest or de-
mand that such petitioning. cease;
I must and will ﬁght if necessary
to prevent that deprivation of a
guaranteed freedom. ‘I will do this
from a practical if not from a
moral point of view, for I know
that those who would deprive my

I opponents of a right would just

as quickly deprive me of that
same right, if I opposed them. 1
This one thing must be made
clear. Neither the Pittsburgh Press
nor anyone else has the right to
tell me, Senator Pepper or any citil
zen how I shall write or how _'_I
shall speak. =

Speaking of Hugh, even though
he devoted a full inch of Pitt News

to Louise Rider he still hasn’t met
her!

Of Last Business Gain

Gain in Pittsburgh business in the
two preceeding weeks was almost
entirely lost last week, the Univer-
sity’s Bureau of Business Research
reports.

Decreases were reported in iron
and steel mill activity, bituminous
coal production, and rail shipments.
The volume of trade increased but
this was not enough to oﬁset the
drop in production and shipments.
As a result, the seasonally adjusted
index of business fell from 142.1
per cent of the 1923-25 average in
the week ended August 1 to 141.5
last week. The index was 148.6 in
the week ended August 9 last year
and 124.4 in the same week of 1940.

  Drive Adds    
i  Drum to Druid Stall A

omen;

Drafting pretty campus girls in an attempt to increase
stamp and bond drive receipts, Druids tomorrow will “raid"
the Tuck shop for feminine salesmen.

After last week's sales
Lieber, BA44, coordinator of Druid
victory committees, and William
Pankuch, ' C44, publicity director,
have decided to give the women an
opportunity to encourage student
and faculty participation.

A large bass drum will be used
tomorrow to make students con-
scious of the fact that stamps and
bonds are being sold on campus.
Hugh Chavern, C44, and Thomas
Moore, C44, co-chairmen of the
drive, will act as drum beaters,
and will lead the bevy of beautiful
women on a parade through the
Tuck shop and diit to the parade
ground. /
,Before the ROTC regimental
V parade’begins, the women sales-
-. men will disperse into the spec-
tators to sell stamps and bonds.
“The deplorable note,” according
to,Pankuch, ,“touched on by sales-
men was the apparent lack of fac-
ulty cooperation in this campus
"drive. Committee members stress
4 the fact that to contact each fac-
ulty member would be an expen-

. sive and laborious procedure.”

“‘It is hoped,” said Pankuch,

."“that enough of the faculty will

take it upon themselves to pur-
chasetheir stamps and bonds here
at the University without any spe-
c eial invitation to do so.”
“ Druids’ draftee list of women
. is virtually complete, although
sChavern has commented that
while'each active Druid is to
draft at least one woman to aid
«. insales, he need not limit him-
self, to only one.

Committee I” members will have

A  little Iowa, replica battleship

booth, set up in the ground ﬂoor
elevator lobby by 19 o’clock tomor-
row morning, and sales will con-
tinue until 4 o’clock in the after-
noon.

28 New Courses
Added to Night
School Classes

Twenty-eight new courses, many
of war-time value, have been added
to the evening school curriculum

according to an announcement made
by Dr. Frank W. Shockley, direct-

or of the evening school division.
The courses will be offered by the

College, the Schools of Education,
Business Administration, Engineer-
ing, and Mines.

The College will offer: the stars
and weather in wartime, the garden
in art and garden designs, cartog-
raphy, geomorphology, the devel-
opment, of American music, ele-
ments of meteorology, the teach-
ing of navigation, speech pathol-
ogy, elements of Chinese, elements
of seismology, physics of radiology,
air and sea navigation, speech cor-
rection and clinic, and comparative
American governments.

Courses that are being otfered
by the School of Education are:
the high school in wartime, and

democratizing‘. inﬂuence in sec-
ondary education.

The School of Business Adminis-
tration offers labor and the state,
economic problems of war and re-
construction, federal tax reports
and accounting, advertising fun-
damentals, industrial budget and
budget control, and war economics.

 iAmerica’s high school youth
should be called to service in order
to give national unity to the youth
and school war etfort,iclaims Dr.
W. W. D. Sones, professor of edu-
cation and director of Pitt’s cur-
riculum laboratory.

Dr. Sones’ plan includes the
calling to service of boys and
girls 14 to 18 years old and the
establishment of a central agency
with authority to direct this ser-
-vicevthrough the schools and al-
lied child and youth service
groups.
His conclusions, taken from a
study of reports of school teachers

and administrators in Pitt's sum- 

mer curriculum workshop, are that
these steps are required _ to pro-
vide motivation for the war work
of boys and girls, identify jobs to
be done, create sound practices,
arouse lay support, and overcome
the inertia of traditiombound
school organization and practice.

.The summer workshop studied
two major problems: “What can
children and youth do in the war‘

effort throughand with the assist-
and ill-prepared.

These problems can be illus-
trated in the lack of deﬁnite
steps to better the poor physical

. condition of American youth, Dr.
Sones points out. Government
and educational agencies have ~
repeatedly, stated that some-
thing must be done about the situ-
uation, yet nothing deﬁnite has
been accomplished for the fall
term. a

The reasons for this lack of ac-
complishment,-Dr. Sones adds, are
that children have not been sensi-
tized to the need for ﬁtness, there
is confusion as to how ﬁtness can
be realized, and there are legal
hindrances to an effective program
in the correction of plgvsical de-
fects. There is little home-commu-
nity cooperation. Finally, oﬁiéial.

Dr. Lolnstoeter Continues  

Family Literary Tradition

Two fearless timely poems by
Dr‘. Lotte‘O. Lohstoeteh appear in
the new Poetry Digest, Annual
Anthology of Verse for 1942.

Both poems concern themselves
with German ideology, past and
present. Dr. Lohstoeter, assistant
professor of modern languages,
questions the purpose of the Ger-
man war machine in “Why?” one‘
of the two poems. Why _ the
“marching day and night” she
asks, if the only reason is “to
fill the world. with fear and fright.”

The second poem, “Germany
That Was,” tells of castles,
music, and folk lore of a country
that is no more.

For many years Dr. Lohstoeter’s
poems have appeared in the coun-
try's ﬁrst anthologies. Her bio-

graphical sketch and the poem_‘

“Hope” were published in the 1942
edition of‘-‘Who’s Who In Poetry.”
