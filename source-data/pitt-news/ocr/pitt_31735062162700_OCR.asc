Men’s Court will consist of the
chief justice and four other jus-
tices. Rowney explained that the
court's‘ advantages should ‘be
brought to the" notice of the‘,stu—
dent body. ‘

The student should consider
Men’s Court in r"elation to SGA
as the Superior Court is to the
Supreme Court of the United
States. It would be much more
advantageous for men’s court to
intercede for the student than
for the student to do,this him"-
self. ' =

In other business SGA approved
payment of a $27.75 bill from

-Carnegie Tech for damages by Pitt

students,’ which occurred at‘ a
-“roving” rally on Nov. 17 follow-
ing the Notre Dame game.

There was doubt in the minds
of the ‘SGA members as to whether
Pitt students actually had dam-
aged anything on their trip‘ to the
Tech campus. However, their dis-
illusions were overruled.

The Social Committee of SGA
has’ consented to help Men's
Council decorate the_ Christmas

Nowhere in the United States is the e

Part of this better living has ‘been the demand for more and

The fraterhity system has received a major boost by
‘the decision of the university to provide an area for a fra-
‘crnity row. The new addition to the campus_ will bring
ith it a number of advantages, most of them for the Afra-
‘rnities themselves.  ’ .
The fraternities which will be participating in the plan’
will/-* beneﬁt from the proximity to each other, in that a’
K eater sense of cohesion should exist. Perhaps a more uni-
d- urpose of fraternities will arise from thisproximity.
. ‘hen, too, the participating fraternities undoubtedly
.- it ill be situated more closely to the main campus area. This

hysical closeness even could result in Aa different type of
oseness to the university, that being a spiritual union.
Rather than thinking of themselves only as members of a
raternity, these men could place themselves back within’
Ztihe realm of the university. . , V

 . ' Too often fraternity men concern themselves withthe
.;usually insigniﬁcant affairs of their,Greek groups. Uni-
versity affairs rarely. exist in the -mfnds of too many fra—.
ternity men, Thus, not only is a greater cohesion necessary
mong fraternities, but it also would be fruitful if it existed’
between fraternities and the rest of the university.
 One material advantage of a fraternityirow to the uni-
sity is that it would be yet another modern addition to
 physical plant. The new structures surely would dress
upgtha-t part of the campus. Another advantage is that some
320 resident students will be accommodated by the houses.
If nothing else, the approval of fraternity row~should

ds a negative View of the system. P ‘, i _' A
' One big “BUT” prevails over the new plan. A fraternity
row is ﬁne, BUT, the fraternity system must do something
fo1;.the university in return. Besides re-entering the realm
of, the university spiritually, the system must improve itself ’.

oademically. . . , A .
 Last year Interfraternity Council President Alan Paper-
nick, returning”from a National IFC conference, recom-
mended that the requirement for fraternity initiation be
raised from a 1.0 ‘(on 3.0 system) to 1.3. The Pitt News, sup-
porting Papernick on this matter, went even further in
scholarship requirements. '
 ' - The suggestion was made to require fraternitygnen to
intain a certain quality point average not only for initia-
ti‘(:n but also ‘throughout their membership in the groups;
IC,/,however~, wanted nothing to do with raising its own

Aademic standards. - ~

Move to the Commons Roo

By Deborah Willson A

It’s getting much too cold around here to sit on
the rugs on the fourth ﬂoor unless you’re next to
the radiator, which sputters dangerously anyway,
so Our Circle has been gathering around the Coffee
Urn in the Hunt Room. Some- .
body made a suggestion not long - 2
ago that we meet in the Com- 2.
mdns Room. S0 A I sent Some
Scouts over to survey the situa-
tion. ‘ 7

In the. Meantime, all of us
suffering from Trimester Tired-‘AA
ness, we slumped against the  ,. A
coffee urn, indulging in desultory {A ‘
conversation. Besides fatigue, the _’ 
deathA of one of our Dearest 
«Friends was depressing us. Alex ‘T ' A
the Alligator passed away last week. “Somebody
dropped a'rock on his head,” said the Alligator
Keeper. His body is being preserved’-in the fourth
ﬂoor refrigerator, if you’re interested in paying
your respects. ‘

“Snow,” said the Poet. (There really.are some,
you know. All you haveto do is Look. Or maybe
know the 'Right People). “Flakes of innocence
descending on the Unclean city. " (Poets commonly‘
speak in Fragments.) “I think I’d .like, to be a
streetcar — roaring down with -vengence on all
those ﬁlthy pedestrains who _soil the pure snow
with their cruddy feet! They’re.the nes who spoil
everything, who make -the world a’ Rotten Orange
ﬁlled with Ashes,” ' 

- I felt this was perhaps going Too Far. AMy
opinion was echoed by the Critic, who stopped
stirring his coffee methodically, (Critics. use siigar
only) and said, "N'6‘w, now Poet’,-— you‘ are ob-
viously overtired and «affected adversely by the
End of Term Strain. I-have noticed,” he said, draw-
'ing his glasses down to the end ofhis nose, “that
Poets are uncommonly Susceptible to Strain. And
of‘ course, Snow,” he ﬁnished. Like all Critics,
ours is marvelously Perceptive.
Official Word , ’ " '-

“Indeed, we are all suffering from the Strain,’_’

said an Administrator who was happening by. ‘

(Administrators always say “Indéed.”) .Even I have

noticed a peculiarly glassy_glaze on .all' the faces.

around me. (Administrators ‘too, are marvelously
perceptive.) I know one boy who has ﬁve thirty-

Consistent C2L,na1iiy’  

A By Julie Thomas ' ‘ . _
Last weekend the Pitt Players added “My Three

Angels” to their growing list _of consistently "good-

.p;1ays. - . A
Centered around three well—intentioned‘convicts
—— an embezzler and two murderers — the three-

act comedy moved fast and with purpose. It was
set in a penal colony in French Guiana in Decem-
ber of 1910 with,Aall of the action taking place in
the family living -room of a general storekeeper,
Monsieur Ducotel» A A"

Facing the DAucotel’s problems of love,’ greed and

‘ hatred, the three heroes pooled their delightfully

criminal ideas and disposed of eachobstacle in a
most permanent. manner, especially the all too
human hindrances of Uncle Henriand his nephew,

Paul. But once the family was restored to its nor=,

mal state, the convicts .quietly resumed their
heavenly roosts, repairing the store’s roof.
Although “My Three Angels,” lacked the power-
ful production of “Guys and Dolls” and the moving
drama of “Our Town,” it contained the same com-‘

‘ petent acting of a ~well-chosen» cast which charac-

chortling gleefully.

Further Saddened by this news we lapsed into
Silence./l However, a Scout sauntered in just then
and Broke It. “Well,” I asked impatiently. “Do
you think we should move to the Commons Room?”

“Well,” he began, pausing reﬂectively. (Some

1 people are ridiculously relaxed. One might go so

far as to say Insensitive.) I talked to some man

' and he said we couldn’t sit on the floor over there.”

“Doesn’t he know that we have to sit on the
floor to reach Conclusions of Importance?”- scream-
ed the. Photographer. (Who is rather more ex"-
citable these days.) “Do they want to stand ‘in
the Way of Knowledge?” ~ —
Practice Needed? ‘, -

“I asked him that,” the Scout said, Yawning,.
“but he said he didn’t know, and didn’t care. He
was practicingfor August when nobody would be
there and would allow -as fewpeople in as’“pos-_

he was only sleepy and not Insensitive after all.

 Jackson, 9 Lucas
 All-Americans In

By TED COLTON

_ _ -, Those fanswho are willing to brave the elements Friday

9 and Saturday nights to watch the Steel Bowl will see one of
§f,_the ﬁnest basketball players in the country. When St. ohns
~cor‘nes on to the court to‘face the Panthers ‘for the second
}T7g«ame of the Friday night double-header there will be a 6-4
.,' colored boy wearing Jersey number 24. O
Most of his teammates will be sophomores with very little
"varsity experience and they will be facing the Panthers who
have alteam made up of mostly veterans, Yet St. Johns will

(‘be favorites to win the game. ,
"ti This situation would seem. strange if it Wasn’t for that
f-.one'6-4 colored boy who will be wearing Jersey number 
‘ » His name -is Tony Jackson and he is the ‘man credited with
 bringing big time basketball back to New York. -

A ‘ Why all this fuss over Jackson? Well, for one thing he .
- is the only player to win the ‘MVP award in the Holiday , '
V Festival and NIT tournaments in the same year. While
- ‘being voted MVP he led his team to the NIT champion-
 ship by hitting for 12 out of 17 from the floor. against St.
-9 Bonaventure and took 16 rebounds. At one point he scor-

V ed 10 straight points. . - ‘ __ T
- ‘ - In the-final against Bradley, he totaled _21 points and took
 9 27'rebounds. All these feats he accomplished while only a
sophomore. He started playing basketball only five years ago.
- Jacksort’s favorite shot is the "jump shot. He is said to
, M be weak on defense but this will improve with the experienc-
O red he received last year. Pittsburgh fans who ‘see Jackson
‘.‘.over the weekend will be reminded of Duquesne’s' Sihugo
'. - Green, Both players can run and jump with the best of .them
and Jackson probably has the edge in thefshooting depart-
ment. - . ‘ .
‘ Jackson will be a sure ﬁre bet thisytar to challenge

Jerry West and Oscar Robertson for the top college play-V '.
er in the country. ,

Speaking about all-An/iericans it was my pleasure to see
Ohio State’s Jerry Lucas perform against the Panthers last
- _ Saturday. Although the Cats didn’t test Mr. Lucas very much

* he did take time out to score 24 points and/grab 18 rebounds.
. The amazing thing was that the only shot he took was a
ff: A hook shot which he made. The rest of his points were scored
 ~ rron tip-ins and lay-ups and he did it with remarkable ease.

V‘ ‘ , Lucas was not very good on defense. As a matter of
fact he hardly played defense at all. Every time one of
the Pant ers would drive in to the pivot Lucas would just
stand there and let him score. _ V

I A Apparently he is under orders from his coach to be care-
ful and not pick up any fouls". Talking to the big 6-71/2 sopho-
more after the game I was curious to know if Lucas hadany’

T ~'other shot beside the tip-ins_ He informed me that the only

 shot he took in high school was the jump shot. He averages

;;,_‘ better than 30 points a game. ‘
-~ Besides his rebounding and shooting skills Lucas is an

V. - excellent passer and a good man on the fast break. Jerry. said

. T. he had no intentions of playing pro ball after college because

he doesn’t like the life the pros lead. From what I saw of
Lucas Saturday he will never be the most spectacular ball
player in the country but he is undoubtedly one of.the best.

‘ Veteran Team

-Coach‘ Bill "Chambers of Wil-
liam and Mary has lost his lead-
ing scorer from last year, Roy
Lange, but -veter'an Jeff Cohen
may make up the difference. The
big 6-7 center heads a cast. of
four returning regulars, including
Bev Vaughan, 6‘-10 Chuck Sand‘-'
ers and Guard Tom Farrington.

The‘Panthers will be fresh off
a disasterous road trip which
found them losing to Ohio State
and Purdue. The Panthers were

trounced by the Buckeyes 94-49
but were able to hold their own

with Purdue after a bad first
half._ V

The Boilermakers grabbed off
a, 49-30, lead by hitting from the-
outside on long one handers. The
Cats had the middle tied up pretty’
well but the long sét shots-broke
their backs. ’ V

A Sankey Stars

Sophomore .Bob Sankey ‘did
most of the scoring for the Cats
in the first half as he netted 15'
points to keep the Panthers show-
ing -respectable. Again the.Blue
and1Gold were hampered with not
beingtable to get a good shotjust
as they were in the Ohio,.State
game.

But in the -second- half Coach
Bob Timmons-sent his crew into
an all-court press and they were-
able to cut the victors margin
from 19 to 12 points by outscor-
ing Purdue 49-42 in the secon
period. ,x .

Sharpshooter Dick Falenski and
Co-Captain Bill _Mauro led the
attack for the Cats in the last
twenty minutes. Falenski, ’who
was the game’s high scorer with
21, made most of his shots on
drive-ins while Mauro was hitting
jump-shots from the key-hole.

Mills Rebounds

This was the third game in a
row that Falenski led "the Panth-

er scorers even though he hasf
not played a full game yet. John?’

Mills was the Cats’ best rebounder
as he controled the boards and
ended uptwith ﬁve points. ‘

“The bad start hurt us,” "stated 9
Timmons. “But the team really.
lookedgood in the second half,”
he concluded. . * _. ’

The Cats will enter the Steel
Bowl with .a 1-2 record while.
Duquesne is 2-0. If this ‘bowl 
anything like ‘it has been in past
years the fans are in store for-'
some 9 exciting basketball

Even though, last year the Panther Tankers were able to
squeak out a narrow victory over the Terrapins of Maryland,
the prospects for the Blue and Gold this year look about
even. The Tankers will open their home season Saturday "eve-
ning at the Carnegie Tech pool at 8 pm.’

Leading the Blue and Gold swimmers against the Ter-

Fitzgerald and Len Paganini. 
Fitzgerald began his swimming
career while‘ in high school at
the YMHA. Because his high
school did not have a team his
aspirations were hindered.
Fitzgerald overcame this and
became proﬁcient in every
stroke, and as ‘a result contended
mostly in the individual medley.
But when he came here the in-
dividual‘ medley was‘ dropped
from inter-collegiate competi-

"~'~_;:\1tion, and he was left as more or

less a man without an event.

“Fitzgerald is a good all—around
swimmer who I can use in every
event, he’s-—a..real utility man,”
coach Ben Grady commented. In
the past two years in the ECSA
championships Fitzgerald has won
four medals for the 200—yard in-
dividual medley and the ,440-yard
freestyle events. .

This year, however, the medley
relay has become a part of col-
legiate competition once again,
and Fitzgerald will return to his

old position.

 Peery Not Crying, Blues

, By JACK SMITH
From all indications, Coach
Rex Perry’s wrestling team stands

'very little chance of improving on

their, 9-1, record of last season.
.Coach Peery isn’t crying the
blues, but he does admit that this

$.'.’*is the least-experienced team he

has had in eight years. “The team
is improving, however,” Peery

. said. “A few of the sophomores

could ﬁll the gaps in our lower
Weight divisions.”

But as for the heavy weight end
of the team, the Panthers ‘seem to

‘lack anyone with enough talent

 

to win in that division. Sopho-
more John Zolinkoff, who won the
E a s t e r n , Collegiate freshmen
championship last year, has shown
promise among the :14’?-pounders.

with‘, other sophomore hopefuls
Bill Robb and Ray Nunn. '
"Larry Lauchle, who is one of
the ﬁnest wrestlers in the coun-
try, could provide a spark to the
team that_ could help them over-
come their lack of experience. '
Last year the grapplers ‘only
loss was to Lehigh, 16-12, while,
on the .win side of the ledger
-the Cats’ defeated Michigan,
Maryland, Syracuse, Lock Ha-
