A difficult future for Pitt?

Trustees raise costs,

 

Pitt trustees approved an $855.1 '

million operating budget without com-
ment last week.

The -budget includes a 4.5 percent
tuition hike for Pennsylvania residents
and a 5.5 percent increase for out-of-
state students.

In addition, several student fees I

will be going up.

The trustees approved increases in
both the student health service fee and
the safety and transportation fee for
Oakland students.

Student health services will now
cost $65 a term, up from $46.

Safety and transportation fees,
which cover the costs of shuttles, Van
Call and lighting around campus, will
go up $7 for full-time students to $37 a
term.

Part—time students will see an
increase of $4 to $16 a term.

The trustees also approved increas-
es in the activities fees for the Bradford
and Johnstown campuses.

J. Wray Connolly, the trustee chair-
man, defended the trustee’s decision to
raise tuition.

C “I still think Pitt is a great bargain,”
said Connolly, who was re-elected to a
third one—year term as chair. “You

attend a world-class university at what I
think is a very reasonable cost.”

Connolly also tried to downplay the
signiﬁcance of recent reports indicating
some students. drop out of school
because of spiraling costs.

“It’s an easy and ready excuse, but
I don’t know that those reports have
been substantiated,” he said.

Also last week, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg announced sweeping
changes in the relationship between Pitt
and the _ University of Pittsburgh

“To meet emerging challenges in
both the academic and health care
worlds  it is essential that we adapt in
the appropriate way,” Nordenberg told
trustees.

According to Nordenberg, Pitt
plans to make three major changes to
draw a greater distinction between Pitt
and the UPMC System, which oversees
the hospital network.

UPMC researchers design new artificial heart

UPMC’s new Pitt Streamliner
Artificial Heart could be ready for
clinical use in three to five years.

M li sa Blackwood

Researchers at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center unveiled
designs for a new artiﬁcial heart they
hope will someday eliminate the need
for donor hearts.

Bartley Grifﬁth, director of the
McGowan Center for Artiﬁcial Organ
Development, said that with proper
funding, the Pitt Strearnliner Artiﬁcial
Heart could be ready for clinical use in
three to ﬁve years.

“But we need your continued help
and support,” Grifﬁth told members of
Pitt’s Board of Trustees last week.

The size of a ‘D’ battery, the
strearnliner will replace the heart’s
pumping function using a magnetically
suspended turbine.

Because of the continuous ﬂow of

 

 

blood the pump produces, strearnliner
patients will have no pulse. ‘

Griffith said the streamliner’s
design is revolutionary because it was
generated entirely by a computer.

“The computer allowed us to come
up with a design we never would have
been able to develop with purely
human engineering,” he said.

The strearnliner is the latest step
for the McGowan Center’s artiﬁcial
heart program.

Bill McGowan, MCI
Communications founder and chair,
endowed the center with $1 million
after receiving a successful heart trans-
plant at UPMC in 1987.

In addition to the strearnliner artiﬁ-
cial heart, researchers at the McGowan
Center are also working to develop an
artiﬁcial lung, kidney, pancreas and
liver.

Provost hails
FAS plan as
cost-saving  

In a memo approving ﬁrnding and fac-
ulty cuts, Provost James Maher urged facul-
ty members to improve their departments
the best they can on a meager budget this
year. ” .
Maher enthusiastically approved what
is known as the Phase IV Plan. The plan
eliminates almost 40 tenured positions,
which will be replaced by 25 full—tirne, non-
tenure-strearn faculty members.

“The plan sets the target size of the FAS
tenure—stream faculty in the range of 505 to
510, which is slightly larger than it was in
1985 and which I ﬁnd more realistic and
sustainable than the status quo,” Maher stat-
ed in the memo.

In an interview, Maher said he believes
the faculty cuts will not hurt Pitt academi-
cally because student enrollment was once
much higher and required more tenured fac-
ulty members. ‘

“The enrollment was substantially 9

lower this year than it was [in 1985], and it
will be a while before we surpass that,” he
said.

The non-tenured faculty ﬁlling the
voids will accept contracts for three years or

- less. Departments have the option ﬁlling the

positions with full-time lecturers, who have
renewable contracts.

Maher said no one will lose their jobs as
a result of the tenured faculty reduction. The
positions will be removed through attrition.

The Phase IV plan also requires depart-
ment heads to continuously review their
programs for funding cuts or areas that may
need more funding.

"This is not a plan about cutting any-
thing. This is not a permanent reduction in
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,” Maher
said. “The intention is to make sure the fund-
ing for these programs is being used proper-
ly, that the money is being used to strength-
en the programs wherever possible.”

This streamlining comes after FAS
Dean Peter Koehler revealed a $2.6 million
budget shortfall in November of 1996. After

‘ a one-time donation of $1.4 million to FAS

from Pitt’s core administrative areas, each
department took a 6 percent cut to balance
the budget for Fiscal Year 1998.

‘There has been a tendency to spread

burial 134 years after his death  

YONKERS, New York — Reporters will
be in the courtroom for the case of 12-year-
old Malcolm Shabazz.

Both the prosecutor and the defense
attorneys had asked to keep the proceedings
closed, but New York family court Judge
Howard Spitz now says he sees “no com-

. pelling circumstance” to warrant that.

However, Spitz is limiting the press
presence to two reporters at the back of the
room, and he’s banning cameras and other
audio-visual coverage.

Shabazz is accused of setting the ﬁre
that killed his grandmother, the widow of
Malcolm X, Betty Shabazz. He is charged
with the juvenile equivalents of murder,
attempted manslaughter, arson, assault and
reckless endangerment.

LEWIS RUN, Pa. -1- State police are look-
ing for an inmate who walked away from a
federal prisoncamp in McKean County.

Officials say Gwassan Saleh was con-
ﬁrmed missing at 4:30 p.m. Monday after a
search of the minimum security camp in
Lewis Run —— about 75 miles Southeast of
Erie.

Saleh was serving a sentence of nearly
six years for conspiracy to deliver drugs.

GE'ITYSBURG, Pa. — One hundred and
thirty four years after he fell in the battle of

Gettysburg, a Civil War soldier has been
laid to rest. _

The remains of the soldier were discov-
ered last year on the vast Pennsylvania bat-
tleﬁeld.

Hundreds of people ——-including two
women believed to be the last surviving
wives of Civil War soldiers —— gathered at
the Gettysburg National Cemetery Tuesday
morning to witness the burial.

It is not known what side the soldier
fought on.

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER — Seven
astronauts are once again off on a 16-day
mission aboard the space shuttle
“Columbia.” They’re hoping to conduct the
science experiments that were on board
another Columbia ﬂight in April — one that
had to be cut short after four days because
of a problem in an electrical generator.

Yesterday’s launch was delayed by 12
minutes because of clouds, but the thunder-
storms that threatened to postpone the
launch didn’t materialize, and the shuttle
lifted off into mostly clear skies.

Some of the experiments on board deal
with ﬁre, plants, crystals and metal. It is Sun-
ilar to the research that will someday be
conducted on the intemational space station.

THE PITT NEWS 3

bargain for with college pets

 

‘When Jen MacGregor bought a tiny kit-
ten at the beginning of her freshman year, she
lcnew it was against dorm rules, but didn’t

think it would cause a problem

But according to experts, many dorm res-
idents don’t consider how diﬂicult it is to keep
an animal until it’s too late.

MacGregor was nervous at ﬁrst and was-
n’t sure she would get through the doors, let
alone be able to hide the cat from her ﬂoor-
mates.

“My roommate and I each had a 
MacGregor recalled “We weren’t the only
ones either.”

In addition to the two cats in their suite,
there were two small rabbits down the hall, a
miniature python next door. a parakeet, a few
gecko lizards and several experimental lab
mice, which were being utilized by two pre-
med students.

“Our ﬂoor was a regular  she said

Once in the dorms, she said they weren’t
afraid of getting caught anymore.

“Our RA had already seen everything. At
one point early on, he came in, and there were
our cats, playing on the ﬂoor right in front of
him,” she said “We tried to hide them, think-
ing he would be angry. But he wasn’t, he just
said they were cute and sat down to play with
them”

Pitt bans all animals except ﬁsh ﬁorn the
dormitories, but many students consider this
rule to be subjective.

By cleverly disguising them in boxes or
bookbags, students smuggle pets into their
rooms without considering the harmful effects
on both people and the animal itself.

While many pets go undetected, the dan-
ger is still very real, according to Joanne
Woodson, director of the Ofﬁce of Residence
Life.

“We have a community of 4,800 people.
People are our ﬁrst priority,” Woodson said.
“VVrth animals in the dorms, we face environ-
mental problems, health problems, allergies
and phobias.”

The problem lies with student disregard
for both University regulations and animal

rights, said Woodson.

“This is a close—knit environment
designed to be utilized by students. It was not
designed to accommodate animals, nor do we
have the facilities or personnel to do  she
said.

The ﬁrst time students are caught with an
animal in their room, they will get a reprimand
and a $25 ﬁne per suitemate, according to the
policies of the ORL.

A second offense warrants residence hall
probation, a $100 ﬁne and possible suspen-
sion. In both cases, the animal must vacate the
dorm within 24 hours.

_ This leaves the responsibility of preserv-
ing the animal’s health and safety to fall heav-
ily on the student’s shoulders. Not long after
she obtained her cat, Jen was faced with this
difficult dilemma

“My roommate eventually realized she
was allergic, and she just couldn’t live with the
cats anymore. We had to get rid of both of
them”

More than anything, Jen remembers the
stress involved in that process. “I put an ad for
a ﬁee cat in the Post-Gazette. Of course, I had
to screen the people who called back to make
sure they were reliable.”

In the end, Jen did ﬁnd a home for the two
cats but had to split them up. “They were
brother and sister and had always been togeth-
er“, I hated to do it,” she said

Not all students are sorry to leave their pet
behind Many dispose of pets at the local
pound, where they believe someone will
adopt the animal.

But they don’t realize when the animal is
not adopted, it is destroyed

Because so few students know how to
take care of a pet properly, experts advise them
to wait until graduation when they will have
more time, money and a more secure home
for the animal.

Nicholas H. Frsﬁs of the South Hills
Animal Hospital warns that combining resi-
dence halls and animals is just too much for a
pet or owner to risk

“Cats get heartworm diseases andneedto
have monthly preventative shots,” he said.
“Lizards are sometimes salmonella carriers

CAMPUS

Pitt recently decided to cut a handful of
low enrollment classes to staff lower-level
English classes that are higher in demand.

The English classes are more necessary
because of the large number of incoming
freshman class, officials said

Professors from several small language
departments have been shifted to ﬁll between
two to ﬁve lower level classes in the English

department.

Tenured faculty members from depart-
ments such as Slavic and East Asian lan-
guages are teaching the classes. These facul-
ty members must teach anywhere from 3 to 5
classes per semester, depending on the
department, to ﬁll their tenure agreement.

This is not a major change, and few
teachers or students will be affected by the
move, according to David Brumble, associ-
ate dean for undergraduate studies.

I Accommodations for students whose
classes have been dropped are being made
by the respective departments. For example,
an independent study option has been pro-
vided for the for the one student whose
Slavic language department course would be
dropped

“We're not interfering with classes for
majors,” Brumble said “Those are sacro-

The committee overseeing the selection
process submitted a recommendation to
Assistant Chancellor Jerry Cochran after a
meeting yesterday moming, said committee
member Lynell Scaff.

Cochran — who is overseeing the com-
mittee — conﬁrmed that he received the
comrnittee’s results.

Cochran would not comment on the rec-
ommendations or name any of the contrac-
tors vying for the contract. Committee mem-
bers would neither conﬁrm nor deny if
Marriott was among the list of contractors.

Wednesday, July 2, I997 .

BRIEFS

The list has been a closely guarded
secret during the selection process.

Cochran said a ﬁnal decision will be
made as early as Friday, if he gets a chance to
review the proposals. He said a decision will
be made at the latest sometime next week

“Once we’ve made a decision,” Cochran
said, “we will then deal with that vendor to
set up a contract”

He added that contractors will be noti-
ﬁed of the decision before the information is
released to the public.

According to Eli Shorak, the assistant
vice chancellor for budget and administration
and the chairman of the negotiating commit-
tee, his committee considered a “number of
factors” in the recommendation process.

“Each vendor was asked to reply to
many things in the [request for proposal, and
items such as food quality, serving the stu-
dent’s needs  and a ﬁnancial retum to the
University  are the primary factors,” Shorak
said

An ambassador from the Dominican
Republic said he would like to see a sharing
of technology between his country and Pitt.

Ambassador Bernardo Vega met with
Provost James Maher Friday to propose a
program that would send Pitt students to
Haiti to study the country’s enviromnent.

The students who might take part in the
project would come from Pitt’s Latin
American Studies Program, which also spon-
sored the ambassador’s visit to Pittsburgh.

Vega came to the city with Eddy
Martinez, a promoter of foreign investment,
to discuss their vision to improve the econo-
my of the Dominican Republic through trade
and investment

Vega said he believes that, with a little
help, the Dominican Republic could become
“the back oﬂice” of the North American

Fisﬁs also said toxoplasmosis and other
conditions can resultin people ﬁorn exposure

do, according to Fisﬁs. Dogs need to be able
to run outside. Cats need shots and medication
to prevent the spread of disease. But when pets
are brought into the dorms, these basic needs
may not be available to them, and this can lead
to serious problems.

“The residence hall environment is not
conducive to keeping animals,” said
Woodson. "Iherefore, it is unhealthy for the
animalstobeintheresidencehalls.”

Leslie Isorn, spokesperson for the

 

Humane Society of the United States and
HSUS associate for companion animal care,
agreed

“While we discourage many college stu-
dents ﬁom acquiring pets until after gradua-
tion, the HSUS urges those students who do
have companion animals to cherish the life-
long responsibility they accepted when they
brought a dog or cat into their lives,” she said.

VV1thout a doubt, responsibility and pet-
ownership go hand in hand. “Companion ani-
mals oﬁen have loyal and loving qualities that
students respond to,” said Isom. “But pet-
ownership is ‘a two-way street. Pets rely on
their owners for proper nutrition, shelter, exer-
cise and veterinary care.”

the health sciences and the
dean of the school of medi-
cine.

Nordenberg said the
move will take place when
the current senior vice chan-
cellor of health sciences,
Thomas Detre, retires.

In another personnel
move, Nordenberg
announced that UPMCS
President Jeff Romoff will
relinquish his position as
senior vice chancellor of
health administration at the
end of the summer.

“This ends UPMCS’s
fiscal oversight of the
school of medicine,”
Nordenberg said. “It will be
taken over by Dr. Detre’s
successor.”

All three moves will
help remove possible con-
ﬂicts between the “increas-
ingly proﬁt—driven” goals of
UPMCS and the academic
goals of the University,
according to Nordenberg.

Nordenberg admitted
that plans are in the works
for more changes in the
future, but he refused to

“I don’t think it would

Nordenberg added that

Maher said budget cutbacks speci-

Interpretation of
U.S. Constitution
is flawed, not

the Brady Bill

The Brady Bill, a highly publicized
piece of gun-control legislation, met opposi-
tion in the U. S. Supreme Court last Friday
when the provision for federally mandated
background checks was ruled unconstitu-
tional. They say it violates the 10th
Amendment, that federal government can-
not tell local governments they have to run

background checks on gun buyers.

That is not the real issue. The courts are
dodging the real issue — the Second
Amendment They wouldn’t be bound by
the 10th Amendment if they would cut to the
chase and reevaluate the meaning of the sec-
ond.

Our courts have decided to follow the
letter of the law rather than the spirit of the
law, and that is an insult, both to the people
of this country and to our founding fathers,
who had no idea their words would be twist-
ed so grossly.

The U.S. Constitution, like all other
legal documents, requires interpretation —
not individual interpretation, but universal
interpretation set by the courts.
Unfortunately, the easiest way for the courts
to do this seems to be by not thinking too
much.

The Second Amendment, which dis-
cusses the right to bear arms, can be inter-
preted a' number of different ways. But the
courts’ current interpretation does not do jus-
tice to the spirit of the law.

For example, it gives “the people” the
right to bear arms, not “each person.” That
could mean that the right of the nation to
have an armed military to ﬁght off other
countries would not be infringed, but indi-
vidual citizens might not have the right to
keep and bear amrs. Two hundred years ago,
all the individual citizens were the armed
militia, since they would all have to ﬁght off
an invasion together. That isn’t the case

‘ today, so under this interpretation, there is no

constitutional right contradicted by gun—con-
trol. .

Of course, one might say that this is an
unreasonable interpretation. Perhaps, but
that’s arguable. It is an interpretation, and all
words are meaningless without interpreta-
tion. There was, after all, a time when “the
people” meant just white, land-owning
males. In any day, it is the responsibility of
the courts to ﬁnd the most reasonable inter-
pretation for the time. If anybody doubts that
interpretation is necessary, think about this
question: Should everybody have the right to
keep and bear thermonuclear weapons?

Our founding fathers certainly never
imagined the technological level of weapon-
ry today, nor the ease with which violent
criminals and little kids could obtain them.

Maybe the world isn’t ending, after all

 

I’m now going to do something I
almost never do: I am going to admit that
I was wrong.

Pick your jaw up off the ﬂoor.

I’m sick and tired of being a nihilist.
Have I lost my marbles? Possibly. Am I a
yahoo? Probably. Do I care? Not really.

The world is not really coming to an
end, after all, gentle reader. Perhaps I was
a bit too quick to jump to the conclusion
that Armageddon was upon us.

I’m not saying that life is a bowl of
chenies, mind you. But it doesn’t have to
just suck and end. If you’ll momentarily
allow me to digress and rethink fonner,
rather bold statements I have made on
these hallowed pages, I think you’ll see
my point 

The fact that I have one class left to
go before I graduate is not the end of the
world. Now, I ﬁnd that I actually enjoy
the class that I have to take. Given the fact
that I have yet to ﬁnd a job, I would be
even more nihilistic and surly if I did not
have at least one thing that I can focus on.
Yes, perhaps I “do nothing,” but I have a
class in whichl am doing quite well, so
that is something.

That I don’t have a full-time occupa-
tion as of yet is another thing that I should
not take too seriously; it’s not a good rea-
son to completely hate life. Even jobless,
penniless, homeless, lying facedown in
the gutter somewhere, I would still be
pretty cool.

A degree, a job and personal attain-
ment are not the only qualitative mea-
sures of a human being. I am a reasonably
nice person. I have friends. I live and
breathe. Therefore, I am not so bad off as
at times I seem to be. So what if people

are too stupid to hire a real, live Opinions
Goddess Emeritus? Their stupidity is no
reﬂection of myself. The only reﬂection
of me is me, and I refuse to fall into the
depths of despair over other people’s
insanity. ’

Bob Dylan is recuperating and no
longer in the hospital. It doesn’t appear that
he is knocking on heaven’s door, and he is
not "going to be singing duets with Elvis
anytime soon. And even if he did kick the
bucket, it wo11ldn’t be the end of my life.

I’m sony, Bob, it’s not that I don’t care
whether or not you live or die. It’s just that
my life shouldn’t revolve around such silly
omerrsasthehealth ofahurnanbeing with
whom I don’t even have contact. Sure, I
met the enigmatic Mr. Dylan once, but it
was just a brief, chance meeting. It was an
interesting experience, one that I will cher-
ish and continue to tell stories about forev-
er, but it wasn’t the deﬁning moment of my
life, just a simple twist of fate. .

I’ve met much more signiﬁcant peo-
ple in my life. They are the one’s with
whom I interact everyday, or at least on a
regular basis. If something were to happen
to any of them, then I would have good
reason to sound tragic and nihilistic.
However, the health of a singer whose
music I happen to enjoy immensely (and
whose music will survive long after he is
gone) and whom I only met once for three
minutes will not make or break my future,
nor decide whether the world will continue
to exist.

"Yes, the world was too shortsighted
to realize that Bob Dylan deserves the
Nobel Prize, but perhaps it was for the
best that he didn’t get it. Bob has gotten
many awards and accolades in his life-
time. Perhaps the Polish poet who
received the NobelPrize had never gotten
any kudos for her work and needed a

break to keep her going. Most of us can
certainly understand what an uphill battle
life can be; I’m glad she got the award. I
hope it brightened her day.

The Hale—Bopp comet incident
proves nothing except that the world is
full of stupid people. The Earth has exist-
ed wrought with morons for the last gazil-
lion years. It will continue to do so. Ifthey
want to be androgynous creatures who
frolic with aliens, they can go ahead. I
sure as hell don’t want to have sex with
them. I don’t think anyone else would
want to have sex with them either.
Therefore, they did us all a favor and rid
the world of however many morons are
now taking the magic carpet ride on the
Hale-Bopp. That was a good sign. The
world’s not going to end. It’s simply in a
transitional period that will make it better
for all ofus who have at least a minimal
measure of intelligence.

The weather has been nice at least
long enough for me to get a good tan. I’ve
met no men named Noah who were
building arks even though it’s beenrain-
ing again this week. If there is someone
out there building an ark, I wasn’t chosen
to be part of any of the two by two pair-
ings to keep the species going. T'hat’s just
ﬁne because no one else that I know
appears to have been chosen, either, so it
would probably be a pretty lame boat
ride.

The point of this all was to let you,
faithful reader, know that the kids are all
right. Armageddon is not upon us —
we’ve just got to wade through the ﬂood.

Jennifer Sinfelt wishes to thank all of
those people who have let her be a leech
sucking on their faith, but she thinks itis
time for her to have a little of her own.
She hopes that she can share a little of it.

Anti-cigarette legislation violation of free speech

 

There’s no easy way to say it: The
cigarette industry’s future is going up in
smoke.

But in a less obvious way, so is
America’s. Under the shield of defending
the unwitting, the U.S. government is tak-
ing a Herculean swing at the freedom of
expression.

Under the guise of serving and pro-
tecting, Congress is playing the role of a
gypsy in the palace, taking more power
for itself and leaving a trusting society
worse off.

I really have to wonder why America .

chose the tobacco industry as its whipping
boy for the 1990s. After all, ifwe, as a
society, were to persecute one “evil,” why
not alcohol?

Most everyone can enjoy a good stiff
drink on occasion, and I’m not suggesting
we should go after the devil’s drink, but
when was the last time you heard of
someone smoking a cigarette or cigar and
then beating their spouse because they got
out of control? Have you ever seen some-
one steal televisions and VCRs to get a
good Camel ﬁx? Have people destroyed
families over their GPCS?

No, cigarettes are not devastating, but
they are addicting, and they can kill you,
say tobacco opponents. So packages will
now carry a three-inch black label to
remind smokers of that.

The question I have in my mind is:
Who in their right mind didn’t already
know this?”

The decades of adds featuring doc-

”Respect” and fear are not the some

 

According to a recent editorial in The

New York Tmes, kids who kill are either a) .

spoiled brats with the moral code of a rabid
wolverine, or b) underprivileged under-
classers who are simply seeking a bit of
“respect,” a word whose meaning they
obviously do not understand. '

Now, human beings are intensely

complex creatures, and language is sup-
posed to help us communicate speciﬁc,
complicated ideas clearly. Misuse of lan-
guage is sloppy, irritating and, I am sure,
has led to murder on more than one occa-
sron.
' I understand that attention to the real
meaning of words, or for that matter, their
correct spelling, is not a high priority in
American culture, but, at the risk of sound-
ing like a pompous-ass grammar-lady, I
must make a few points about the word
“respect.”

Webster deﬁnes “respect” as “to con-
sider worthy of high regard,” and alterna-

tors who prefer Camel cigarettes two to
one are long gone, and the anti-smoking
lobby has come a long way, baby.

The fact that every rookie smoker
coughs and hacks a lung out on their ﬁrst
drag is a pretty good indication that ciga-
rettes are not likely to be a big seller at
GNC —- no matter how good their PR
gurus are.

To add punitive damages to injury,
the federal government has decided that
cigarettes are targeted too much at chil-
dren, the theory being that once junior
starts smokin’ in the boys roonr, he’ll be a
weepy, “I’m-in-the-tlrroes-of—addiction!”
Geraldo guest by the time he’s 25.

tively as “to reﬁain from interfering with.”
One of the rabid wolverine types quoted in
The New York Times said, “Nobody disses
you when you are pointing a gun at them.”
The poor little underprivileged one is sadly
mistaken. The deference shown to a gun-
man has nothing to do with respect or with
its opposite, “diss” (not yet appearing in
“Websters,” but I shan’t bother turning in
my grave when it does). The correct word
to describe the feelings evoked by having a
gun pointed at one, would, I submit, be
“fear” — “the response to sudden aware-
ness of danger;” that is, “the stimuli for a
neurochenrical chain of events designed by
evolutionary processes to preserve the life
of the organism.”

The person who enjoys scaring others
out of composure by using or threatening
violence is not seeking respect. They are
seeking power. Power does not equal
respect. In fact, if you must ’ exert your
power in order to receive “respect,” you
are not gaining real respect, but its facsim-
ile. Being polite (OK, so your tongueis
right down the back of their trousers.) to

Yeah right  and I’m R.J. Reynolds.

The problem of underage smoking
doesn’t lie in the manufacturers’ corporate
ofﬁces or above I-80 on a billboard, but in
the man standing behind the Quickie-
Mart counter selling the smokes to Gary
Coleman look-alikes without I.D. .

Nevertheless, to ﬁght underage
smoking, Uncle Sam told manufacturers
that the Marlboro Man should beat it from
billboards, and Joe Camel better butt out
of being strategically placed in movies.
And, among a federal payroll-length list
of restrictions, the backs of magazines
won’t look half as neat with black and
white print advertisements for smokes.

police officers who pull you over to give
you a speeding ticket is a strategy used to
avoid further legal ramiﬁcations, not a sign
that you happen to ﬁnd those police ofﬁ-
cers interesting and attractive persons with
whom you seek to interact.

At the local chain restaurant where I
work, a couple comes in every night for a
$3 French Slam. At the sight of them walk-
ing in the door, all the servers groan collec-
tively. They want freshly cooked bacon.
They want the french toast on a separate
plate. They want their eggs over medium
well, but not crispy on the bottom. They
want extra powdered sugar on the side and
the syrup warmed up. Oh, and they want a
side of white toast, golden brown. Almost
every night, something is wrong and must
be sent back to be redone. For the efforts of
the server obtaining their requirements,
this couple leaves a dirty dollar bill and
some change, usually conveniently located
in a puddle of syrup and powdered sugar
just left of the ketchup bottle.

The regularity with which these “Oh
god, it’s the french toast people!” show up

Having indulged in an occasional
cigarette myself, I have one thing to say to
Big Brother: ‘Thanks for nothing.”

Any half-witted wonder can ﬁgure
out smoking is bad for them. I realize we
have to stoop down and protect the lowest
common denominator of our nation —
those who may still be oblivious to tobac-
co’s health risks — but anyone operating
at that mental level may not have enough
sense to keep themselves alive very long,
anyhow.

Now that the dangers are publicized,
the risk is ours to take. We should wony
less about cigarette advertising and more
about fending off the litigious jaws of
tort-hungry lawyers who press their
clients into a bambi-ized “sniff, sniﬂ 
addiction” excuses.

It’s America, land of the free and
home of the capitalists; baby. The price of
freedom comes in the shape of a generic
soft-pack of cigarettes. We have the right
to choose to pick up or snuff out that
tlrree-inch ember, without the greasy little
ﬁngers of legislators helping us one way
or the other. .

I’m sure the government would also
like to take this moment to thank the
tobacco ~ companies for giving

‘Washington its chance to look so ho1ier-

than—thou.

Just look to the irony of a group of
paid-off career politicians — involved in
more scandals than there are cigarettes in
a carton — signing a bill persecuting
tobacco manufacturers for “lying” to the
American people.

When Big Brother lied to the volun-

thing, kids

have led to their knowing all of the evening
servers. They greet -us cheerfully and are
usually pleasant, even when rejecting eggs,
complaining about bacon and sending
syrup to be warmed up, again. I asked my
colleague, “Why do these people act like
they’re our best friends?” She responded
with her usual biting accuracy: “Because
we get them what they want, they think we
like them. They don’t realize we only get it
right so they can leave quicker because we
hate them.”

In many situations, such as serving the
public in a restaurant or as a police ofﬁcer,
the giving and getting of respect is all part
of the job. It goes with the tenitory. It’s not
“real” respect, but it’s a good facsimile,
required for oiling the social wheels. I must
respect my manager, but I don’t have to
likehim.(Infact,Ireallylikehimand
don’t respect him that much, but we’ll save
that for another day.) IfI get tired of being
a humble student, a humble waitress or a
humble speeding ticket recipient, I guess I
could go to K-mart and buy myself a gun

Marijuana

The results of two new
studies about marijuana were
released last week, and now
cannabis is bearing the more
official seal of being a “gate-
way drug.” Apparently, smok-
ing grass stimulates the same
“pleasure centers” in the brain
as do alcohol, cocaine and
heroin. The body also goes
through the same physical
processes in orgasm as when
sneezing. Muscles contract,
blood rushes to the ears, the
spine explodes. Drugs are

drugs, and they stimulate the .

nervous system, but this
rhetoric of how doing one
drug is going to lead a person
on to another, “heavier,” drug
is ridiculous and borders on
brainwashing.

When people drink fre-
quently and in great quanti-
ties, a tolerance is built, and
they don’t get drunk as easily.
If a person is drinking wine all
night and isn’t quite drunk

yet, what’s the likelihood of

them switching to bourbon so
they can be drunk? Is beer a
gateway drug to grain alco-
hol? I have a friend who
chews tobacco, so I -guess
pretty soon he’l1 start smoking
cigarettes, and it may even
lead to a pipe.

With drugs and alcohol, I
agree that there may be a like-
lihood for a person to experi-
ment with different things so
as to achieve different highs,
but marijuana smokers aren’t
necessarily cokehead speed-
freaks, let alone “I’m, like,
moving through liquid’’ on the
nod junkies. These are three,
very distinct, very different
highs. A person may want to

 

experiment with these differ-
ent experiences, and that is
precisely the point: A person
may want to.

Drugs do not lead people
to harder drugs; people lead
themselves to higher drugs.

This argument of drug use
compounding upon itself to
form high addictions is a cop-
out for people not being
responsible for their own
actions. I find it almost equiv-
alent to the argument that ads
make people buy things. They
don’t. If an ad appeals to a
person, they may go out and
purchase the item or service if
they think it will do something
for them. Perhaps drugs are
being marketed in the same
fashion because what a per-
son’s friends are doing or the
experiences they are relaying
sound intriguing. People try
things because they want to
try them. A .

The likelihood of marijua
na leading a person on to
harder substances is perhaps
found in its non-lega1ity.'This
is an argument being proposed
by pot proponents. Since
smokers have to obtain it from
a dealer, there is a chance that
the dealer will sell more than
just weed. Since it is an illegal
drug, there’s a chance that
more than just this drug will
be present at a party or a deal-
er’s house. Plausible,yes, but
this still evades the issue of
personal willpower, restraint,
and control. Everyone has
their own limit to indulgence.

Perhaps lowered inhibi-
tions and a loss of control are
the causes of addictions. If
that’s the case, from my own
experience, I’d say alcohol is
the biggest culprit. This is the
big legal one that lowers

THE PITT NEWS

opponents are stoned

restraints and makes people
do what they’re hesitant to do
otherwise. Smoking grass
doesn’t give the smoker the
same amount of artificial con-
fidence it takes to approach
strangers, go crazy and wreck
havoc that bourbon does.
When a person is stoned, their
inhibitions are nowhere near
as lowered, and in some cases,
people report a feeling of
paranoia. Which, then, is the

‘lesser evil: the stoner who sits

calm and quiet or laughs hys-
terically, or the drunk who
broods and bitches or may be

boisterous and antagonizing? ‘

If people persist in not
accepting responsibility for
their own actions in regards to
the choices they make, then
let alcohol be the save-all
scapegoat when referring to
addiction. “Sorry, I was
drunk” is a common enough
phrase.

As people get older, peer
pressure declines. People who
are partaking in one drug or
another may offer it to another
person out of politeness, but if
it’s refused, they usually adopt
the attitude of “Hey, more for
me.” No one inhales, snorts or
shoots up for anyone else, it’s
a personal experience and per-
sonal choice. In essence, we
create our own addictions
through our actions. Control
lies first in a person’s thoughts
and then in their actions;
scapegoats are simply cop-out
excuses. It’s sad to know that
science and psychology are
striving to prove otherwise.

Michael Ivan wants everybody
to take responsibility for their
own actions and behaviors
and to quit blaming things
that can ’t speak up. .

and start pointing it at my tyrant
professors, managers and state
troopers, and then they'd have
to respect me, right?

Somehow, I believe the
experience would be a little hol-
low. What would it really be like
to be behind a gun, watching
someone else cower with fear?
The feeling of absolute power
would be odd. Personally, I
don’t think I’d ﬁndit very pleas-
ant, but apparently, plenty of
people do. Unfortunately, they
misname the feeling “respect,”
and the complexity of human
experience is once more
reduced to — the wrong word.
Violence is endemic in this soci-
ety and others because the bal-
ance of power is just that: a bal-
ance to be tipped and swayed in
the ebb and ﬂow of normal
human events.

Symphony celebrates with free show

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
jumps into its summer schedule this weekend
at the July Fourth Celebration at the Point.

Resident Conductor Arthur Post leads the
orchestra in Fourth of July favorites like John
Philip Sousa’s “Stars and Stripes Forever” and

musical and movie classics like John a
Williams’ theme from Star Wars. And, of ‘
course, there’s the obligatory “1812 Overture”

from Tchaikovsky.

Students, families and ﬁreworks aﬁ- J

cionados should plan to arrive at Point State
Park well before the 8 p.m. start though — last
year, 200,000 people showed.

The July Fourth show will serve as a pre-
view of the PSO’s upcoming 1997-98 season,
its ﬁrst with new music director Mariss
J ansons. From favorites like Mussorgsky’s
“Night on Bald Mormtain” (Oct. 30 to Nov. 2)

and Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries” (Feb. 20
to 22) to the more eclectic works of Zappa
(Oct. 3 to 5), Bartok (Oct. 9 to 12) and Ligeti
(Jan. 22 to 24), each weekend the orchestra
will present a new program of two or three
scheduled pieces and a “musical mystery.”
The PS0 has also commissioned original
works — two of which they’ll debut this sea-
son. , V
The orchestra’s latest CD release includes
two different commissioned pieces ﬁorn
Richard Danielpour, “Concerto for Orchestra”
and “Anima Mundi,” a ballet. Danielpour’s
work is not currently on this year’s schedule.
Each piece has four movements, and nei-
ther one has been played in concert yet, which
is rare because most pieces don’t debut on
CD. Each is as dark as the Cathedral’s com-
mon room. And each deals with the themes of

in the background. Even the slow sections are
hard-hitting, making up in volume and emo-
tion what it lacks in speed. But, the ends are
too abrupt and lack closure. They simply stop.

In the ballet, the movement mirrors the
four seasons, and each section is really given
a chance to shine through. Listen for the
strings and percussion; they toss the themes
around in small variation, which gives this
piece more ﬂow than the other.

The CD isn't festive, but on a rainy day,
it’ll provide some pretty bright ﬁreworks. And
there probably aren’t 200,0()0 people in your
living room.

American rock icon John Fogerty releases first album in 12 years

“Honey, what’s that sound? / Big
wheels rollin’ homeward bound.” So
sayeth John Fogerty on “Southem

coming to southem—fried rock’n’rol1
roots with the new album Blue Moon
Swamp.

Fans have waited 12 years for
Blue Moon Swamp, the ﬁrst Fogerty
album to be released since Centerﬁeld
in 1985 —— which itself took Fogerty
10 years to make. Fortunately, Blue
Moon Swamp, like Centerﬁeld, has
been well worth the wait.

lowed considerably since belting out
“Proud Mary” and “Fortunate Son”
with Creedence Clearwater Revival,
his voice hasn’t changed in 30 years.
In fact, he sounds better on Blue
Moon Swamp than he did on
Centerﬁeld. y

Diehard CCR fans should deﬁ-
nitely check out Blue Moon Swamp.

“Hot Rod Heart” is in much the

as he also does on “Blue Boy.”

For those who are looking for
something a little more sultry, get a

cool drink of water, a soft rag to

soothe your face and listen to “A

the balmy breeze of summer and let
Fogerty’s voice carry you away.

Everything is" quiet and still / I set here

“It may look easy/ When you

of effort to produce Blue Moon

THE PITT NEWS

Wednesday, July 2, ‘I997 _

 

The Pitt News film
critic unearths a
shocking cinematic
conspiracy lurking
beneath the surface
of the latest summer

blockbuster 

[Editor’s note: This movie review was
faxed to The Pitt News early in the mom-
ing on Tuesday, July I. No one has seen
or heard from ﬁlm critic Stephen H. Segal
since. ]

Listen closely. I don’t have much
time because they’re coming to erase my
brain.

Who, you ask? Them —— with a capi-
tal T. The ones who keep the secrets. The
ones who answer to no higher authority.

' The Men in Black.

When I received word that there
would be a special invitational screening
of director Barry Sonnenfeld’s new film,
Men in Black, a supposedly ﬁctional tale
of a super-top-secret government agency
that monitors extraterrestrial activities on
Earth, I thought it sounded like a fun way
to spend a summer evening.

Fun. What a
joke. In fact, my
life as I knew it
was about to end.

I got off the bus
in Monroeville
and walked into
the Showcase
Cinemas lobby
easily enough —
handed my invita-
tion to the lady at
the box office, bought some popcorn,
shoved my ticket stub into my pocket and
headed on into the darkened theater.

The previews that preceded the film
were less than encouraging. Judging by
the three-minute trailers, Air Force One is
a new excuse to cast Harrison Ford in the
role of a government oﬁicial turned reluc-
tant hero amidst presidential turmoil, and
Starship Troopers, based on a classic
Robert Heinlein science ﬁction novel, is
an excuse to film lots of big explosions

 

' without the extraneous trappings of plot

and character. If Men in Black proved no

better than its opening acts, I would be"

disappointed —- especially since the sum-
mer’s other big high-tech blockbuster,
Batman and Robin, had already caused

Agents K and J use the flashy-light thing: ”Just the facts, ma’am. That's what you're about to forget ...”

me to ﬂee the theater screaming.

But 10 minutes into Men in Black, I
was feeling good. For the first time since
The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, I
found myself watching a sci-ﬁ adventure
with a witty sense of humor rather than a
slapstick one (Spaceballs) or a just plain
stupid one (Mars Attacks’).

I laughed when Tommy Lee Jones, as
grim-faced as ever in hisrole as the alien-
hunting secret agent known only as K,
went searching for leads in the supermar-
ket tabloids. That’s where all the real
facts are, he says, though “once in a while
The New ‘York limes gets lucky.”

I laughed even harder when Will
Smith, as fresh-mouthed as ever in his
role as K’s rookie partner J, grew indig-
nant upon seeing K use a hand-held,
light—ﬂashing device to erase the memory
of an attractive pathologist (Linda
Fiorentino) who had learned too much.
“You’re gonna give her brain cancer!” J
shouts, all the while . staring not at her
brain.

(Smith has one heck of a promising
acting career ahead of him; he’s a lot like
Robin VV1lliams in that no matter who he
plays, there’s always that vital spark at the

‘core that the audience knows will delight

them. Smith will always be the Fresh
Prince at heart, just as \lVilliams will
always be Mork from Ork.)

And I laughed really hard when K

always knew there was something ﬁshy
about Sylvester Stallone.

Unfortunately, at this point I was
laughing so hard that I had to make use of
the theater’s plumbing facilities. Sol got
up from my seat and dashed out the door
to the restroom, hoping to pop in and out
quickly so I wouldn’t miss much of the
ﬁlm.

I walked into the bathroom just in
time to hear the words, “—now that it’s a
Hollywood comedy, no one will ever
believe it could be
true.” What?

Two men were
standing in front of
the row of urinals.
Two men in black.
Wearing sunglasses.
They turned their
heads and saw me —
then simultaneously
reached into their

I smacked the .
button on the airdryer ”~°=~~ ~-

and sent a blast of hot air shooting into

their faces. As they reeled, I whirled and
took otf through the door.

My heart was thumping as I ran out
of the building and across the parking lot.
Over the pounding of my footsteps
against the pavement I heard a shout from
behind: “You’re not going to get away,
you know! Just stop now, we'll erase
your memory, and you can go about your
life as if this never happened!”

I leapt intothe middle of thehigh- ,

     

way. Cars swerved and honked at me —
one skidded to a screeching halt just inch-
es away — but I knew that my life was
unimportant compared to the need to get
to a phone, a fax machine, anything to let
the American public know that they were
being duped.

As I reached the other side of the
road, I risked sneaking a glance over my
shoulder. The Men in Black were stuck in
tralﬁc for the moment. I poured on the
acceleration and hightailed it to the front
door of Thrift Drug.
Locked.

I ran around to
the back of the build-
ing — panting pretty
seriously by now --
and jimmied the lock
on the service
entrance. I slammed
the door behind me
and barricaded it with
several large boxes of
generic-brand antiper-
~  "~* spirant. I quickly
found the administrative office, wrote this
document and am now about to fax it to
my editor at The Pitt News.

This account must reach the public.
America, beware. The conspiracy theo-
ries are true. The alarmists are justiﬁed.
There are government agencies with the
power to wipe our brains clean of any
information that they don't want us to
have.

And I can hear them knocking at the
door. , y . j . , .

Tyson bites-
when bullying
finally fails

It has finally come to an end.

Not Evander Holyfield’s career.
Not Don King’s bank statement. Not
even the credibility of boxing.

But, rather, the mystique that had
surrounded Mike Tyson since he
became the youngest heavyweight
champion ever 10 years ago, when he
was 21 years old. It’s gone. Forever.

The man who was once known as
the baddest man on the planet found
himself on the other side of the bully-
ing Saturday night, as Holyfield used
his six—inch reach advantage to toss
the former heavyweight champ
around the ring. Tyson was ineffec-
tive during the first two rounds, large-
ly due to the fact that Holyfield read
Tyson’s punches and deﬂected them
before they could reach their intended
target.

Frustrated and realizing he could-
n’t beat the gospel-singing warrior
with his hands, Tyson resorted to
using his mouth in the third round and
bit the right ear of Holyfield, who
jumped around the ring in disbelief.

Mills Lane, the referee, deducted

. two points. Just a few moments later

in the same round, Tyson hit again,
this time gnawing at the left ear.
Suspensions, fines and a bunch of bad
newspaper headlines followed.

But did T‘yson’s actions occur in
the heat of battle, or were they actions
of a man who, upset with Lane’s
refusal _ to deduct points from
Holyfield for headbutting (which
replays showed were unintentional),
knew exactly what he was doing?

It’s a question Team Tyson wants
fans and commissioners to consider,
hoping that option one will save the
fighter some embarrassment.

Don’t buy it. After all, he did for-
get his mouthpiece as he came out of
his comer for the third round.

Tyson said afterwards that he took j

matters into his own mouth, er, hands,
because his career was at stake. That
means Tyson knew exactly what he
was doing.

And that means he’s as immature
now as he was 10 years ago.

More significantly, it means that
Tyson gave up. Call it “No Mas II.”
Tyson knew he was getting whipped
and could do nothing about it. If he

Smith finishes stellar second eason
Awards abound for Pitt's All-American 9

Rachel Lenzi

 

When she’s not leaping over build-
ings or outrunning the crazy folk of
Oakland, Trecia Smith can be found
sleeping.

Yes, sleeping. Escaping the hustle of
everyday life in the city and catching
some Zs. A productive way to spend what
free time is available when she’s not
studying, practicing, competing for the
Lady Panther track team, winning nation-
al championships and breaking records.

Smith is an occupational therapy
major, an All—American, a national cham-
pion and a national record holder. Oh, and
a sophomore.

Her list of accolades reads something
like the back of a Wheaties box. Two
weeks ago, she was awarded the presti-
gious title of female Division IAthlete of
the Year, the latest award in her ever-
growing trophy case. She’s added it to the
1997 national championship she won in
the long jump (21-10), the national record,
she holds in the triple jump (46-8), the
ECAC Championships Women’s Most
Outstanding Performer of 1997, four Big
East Championships and ﬁve All-
American titles.

Smith also holds numerous Pitt
records, including the long jump and the
oiplojomp: 9 9 7 7

But she is reluctant to boast about her
accomplishments. Modest regarding her
performance, she would rather let the
accolades speak for her and for them-
selves. j V

“I didn’t expect to accomplish this
much,’’ she said. “But I expected to

improve, and I’m very happy with the .

results.”

Head Coach Steve Lewis, however,
is quick to brag about his star performer.

‘Trecia had the best season of any
female athlete in the country,” noted
Lewis. “There isn’t much she didn’t
accomplish this season.”

Armed with her record-shattering
triple jump performance, Smith dominat-
ed the ECAC’s, placing ﬁrst in the high
jump (5-11.25) and the long jump (22-
0.75). She took third in the shot put with
a throw of 46-8.25 and eighth in the
javelin with a throw of 133-1.
Singlehandedly, she gathered 28 points
for the Panthers.

At the 1997 Big East
Championships, Smith took ﬁrst place in

the long jump (21-7.8), triple jump (43-5)

Performance-enhancer evades NCAA, for now 9

 
 

 <='

Pitt junior swimmer Noah Caplan
had just completed his freshman year
and was looking for some way to
improve his off-season training. He
had heard of a do-it-all training sup-
plement that many Pitt athletes were
taking to enhance their perfonnance.

Without trainer supervision or
coach’s permission, Caplan began
using the creatine supplement and
realized immediate results.

That summer, Caplan started
ingesting just a spoonful of creatine
mixed with his favorite juice before
and after his normal daily workouts.
It was the same workout he’d always
done, but the Pitt athlete realized he
had new found strength and
endurance. He gained eight pounds of
muscle mass, mostly in his upper
body, after his ﬁrst six weeks of use.

“I started using it religiously, and
the results were tremendous,” said
Caplan. “During.my..pool. workouts,.I

could swim longer and faster. I was
always full of energy.”

Although the NCAA prides itself
on regulating Pitt athletes’ practice
time, personnel life and training, they
have yet to fully research creatine, a
muscle supplement now used by
many Pitt athletes that has been
rumored to cause health risks in ath-
letes while giving them an unfair
advantage in competition. ,

Creatine is a natural substance
found in human and animal muscle
tissue. The substance acts as a reserve
tank when the original energy supply

‘ of a muscle is depleted.

Naturally, an athlete’s workout
can run through a muscle’s energy
supply quite. quickly- And when the

muscle is out of fuel, the workout is
over. Any further muscle develop-
ment must be put on hold.

That is, unless another energy
source can take up where the body’s
natural creatine gives out. , V

If such a power boost were possi-
ble, athletes could work out longer
and reap the benefits accordingly.

An extra dose of creatine may be
enough for such a boost. And accord-
ing to medical research, taking a sup-
plement of the drug will increase the
amount of time an athlete can com-
pete at a high intensity level.

Much like the carbohydrate-load
shakes employed by many
weightlifters, creatine comes in pow-
der form and can be taken before and

after workouts. However, the creatine’ 2
is much more potent, leaving some to 9

Pitt wrestling brings local talent to summer camp

 

 

For most youngsters, going to
summer camp involves canoe rides,

‘a lot of insect repellent and making

leather wallets. But for young

wrestlers, camp involves headlocks,

half-nelsons and weight training.
Each summer, wide-eyed young

grapplers all across the country

travel to small colleges and big uni-

versities to train with All-
American-caliber wrestlers and
coaches.

Next week, the Panther

wrestling staff will share some of

their expert mat knowledge with
some of these young wrestlers as
Pitt opens its doors to host its annu-
al wrestling camp.

“Camps are good because they
give guys a chance to learn tech-
nique and mat strategy from college
coaches,” Pitt Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “But they’ve also
got to be fun. The kids stay in the
dorms and get a first taste of what
college life is like.”

This year’s camp is designed to
be both educational and fun for the
kids, most of whom, not by coinci-
dence, will be talented wrestlers
only a short time away from choos-

ing a college program. Stottlemyer
—— along with assistant coaches Dan
Payne and Eddie Palmer, as well as
many of the Panther wrestlers —
will act as the camp counselor.

The camp will involve tech-
nique demonstration, weight train-
ing, lectures on diet, nutrition and
motivation and lots of live competi-
tion.

All types of wrestling
freestyle, college, Greco-Roman,
anything outside of the World
Wrestling Federation — will be
taught by‘Panther staffers. A group
trip to Kennywood is also included
in the price of the camp.

Pitt’s new administration has
become more open to camps of all
kinds than in past years. Stottlemyer
said they see it as a good way to
make use of the facilities in the
summer, to show off the University
to prospective future students and,
of course, to earn a little money.

“I think you’ll see more camps
here in years to come,” Stottlemyer
said, “not just wrestling camps, but
other sports and academic camps as
well.”

This summer’s wrestling camp,
aimed. primarily at high schoolers,
is open to wrestlers ages 11 through
18 and will run from July 6 toll.

Column

got himself disqualiﬁed, however, he
could say that he didn’t get beat.

The standing-room-only crowd"

that packed the MGM Grand and the
millions of pay-per-view suckers
worldwide knew differently.

It was evident from the moment
Tyson left his dressing room with his
posse of thugs. He didn’t have the
invincible stone face that had been his
trademark. His was a face of insecuri-
ty that -lacked the trademark conﬁ-
dence that once scared Michael
Spinks to the ground in under two
minutes. Tyson looked as though he
wasn’t sure he wanted to enter the
ring. Except, of course, to pick up his
$30 million check.

Since his return to boxing from
prison, Tyson hasn’t been the same.

The man who began his pro career
by knocking out his first 19 opponents
(including 12 in the ﬁrst round) could
instill fear into his opponents simply
by stepping into the ring. Tyson no
longer has the same aura. ’

Maybe it’s because he has won so
many millions of dollars that he no
longer has the desire. Maybe his skills
eroded so much during his time in jail
that he can no longer do the things he
once did. Maybe his new Muslim faith

 

momma: 112

has taken away his tenacity.

Maybe battling beauty-pageant
contestants takes more out of a guy
than one would imagine.

One thing is certain -— Tyson is no
longer the bully in the heavyweight
division.

Before the fight he said, “I’m
gonna show [Holyﬁeld] what a bully
does.”

Tyson did show what bullies can’t
do — box.

He was able to breeze through the
division against amazingly—overrated
bums like Peter McNeely and washed-
up heavyweights like Larry Holmes
by using his brute strength. But
Saturday, Tyson went up against an
opponent who wouldn’t be intimidat-
ed and who had enough strength to
toss the ex-champ wherever he want-
ed. .

Holyfield backed Tyson into a cor-
ner and Tyson, showing his true char-
acter, couldn’t fight his way out of it.
Instead, he tried biting his way out.

And in an instant, Iron Mike’s
mystique disappeared for good.

Jeﬁ Owen is a columnist for The Pitt
News and would like to kick Don
King’s ass. Just no biting, please.

Creatine

the NCAA Sports Sciences
Department. Everything from street
drugs like marijuana to anabolic
agents like testosterone are banned.
These and others are banned
because they either have severe side
effects or promote unfair competi-
tion by enhancing an athlete’s per-
formance. Creatine is not men-
. tioned.

After a summer of use, Caplan
quit using the drug because of
repeated bouts of cramping and
shortness of breath while swim-
ming. However, the swimmer
believes the medical problems were
not the fault of the creatine, but of
the intense training that Head Swim
Coach Chuck Knowles had institut-
ed at the beginning of season.

“It was the hardest training I had
ever put myself though, and I
strongly believe that was the reason
for the cramps, not the creatine,”
said Caplan.

Knowles told his swimmer that
the creatine was the cause. He even
went so far as to give Caplan a copy
of an article from a health magazine
filled with research showing that
creatine can cause intense cramping
to major muscle groups in some

people.

“When coach gave me that arti-
cle it made me rethink using crea-
tine, but cramps continued after I
stopped using it,” said Caplan.

The NCAA will further investi-
gate and research the possible side
effects of creatine use on the human
body, but as of now, there are no
plans for its banishment from com-
petition.

The NCAA’s concern stems
from nationwide reports of dehydra-
tion, heat exhaustion and muscle
cramping in college athletes during
creatine use. And while the use of
such a material could lead to unfair
competition, the NCAA has yet to
use that line of reasoning for possi-
ble creatine banishment.

“There are some possible per-
formance-enhancing and health
questions with creatine,” said Cindy
Thomas, NCAA official. “But just
because it is perforinance-enhanc-
ing, [such drugs] aren’t going to get
banned.”

Next week: Pitt athletes who have
benefited from the substance, as
well as the Pitt strength coach who
administers it.

high jump and third in the javelin.

Sn1ith’s track career began over 10
years ago in Jamaica, a country where the
running competition is ultra-intense.
Running was her first sport, but she also
competed in netball — a sport which she
describes as “similar to basketball, but you
don’tr1mwith theb .” However, as a
standout at Manning High School, Smith
caught the attention of Lewis at the Penn

-Relays in Philadelphia and after being

introduced to him, was impressed by his
program at Pitt.

.“My high school coach met Coach
Lewis [in Philadelphia] when I competed,”
Smith said. “He liked what Coach Lewis
hadtosayabouttheprogramatPittand
pushed me in that direction.”

her athletic talents and molded Smith into a
multi-event competitor. Two years later,
she is not only performing well as part of
the track team, but also as a student.

Before leaving for a summer in
Jamaica, Smith was preparing for a physics
exam. Citing her aversion to physics or
chemistry, she explained why she chose to
go into occupational therapy.

“I wanted to be a doctor,” she said.
“I’ve always done well in biology, and I

wanted to do something with it. When the .

time came to decide a major, I looked at my
options in the ﬁeld of biology and liked
what I saw.”

the chance torun. I wantto be in aposition

in the future where I can choose to run.

“I don’t want to be in track strictly for
the ﬁnancial reasons. Sine, I would love to
beinvitedtoaraceliketheGrandPrixand
maybe win some money, but it’s not my
driving force. At any point I could just say,
‘I quit’, walk away from the sport and still
be qualiﬁed to do something.”

on her future.

“I can’t predict it,” Lewis said “It pre-
sents obstacles and unneeded expectations,
