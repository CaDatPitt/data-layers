Women’s Vote Backs Measure;
SC To Push For Immediate Action

By IRV ROTHMAN
Pitt students have voted overwhelmingly in favor of
women cheerleaders. In the special referendum, held dur-
ing registration, 90% of men and women undergraduates

who voted were in favor of

“giving women the opportunity

to be cheerleaders.”
Ross Reese, SC president, stat-
ed, “The committee, acting on
student decision, is going to bring
the matter to the attention of
proper University ofﬁcials imme-
diately. We conﬁdently expect
good results.”
PStuCent Congress members were

told of the success of the student‘

referendum in terms of participa-
tion and interest when 3,603 un-
dergraduate students cast votes.
Paul Petro, SC assemblies chair?-
man, delivered the report at Mon-
day’s meeting in the absence of
the originator Sam Balk; who has
graduated.

Over $30 Million
Spent Here to Date

By JOHN DeNINNO
Over $30,100,000 has been spent by the University in the
past ﬁve years for -buildings construction and land acquisi-
tion, according to Robert Machesney, director of the build-

ing fund.

A breakdown of the above amount shows that a large.

percentage of the total was spent on the University’s Medical’

Center.

In 1948 the University received $13,600,000 from the A.

W. Mellon Educational and Char-e

itable Trust Fund. The money was
for the establishment of a Gradu-
ate School of Public Health: $5,-
000,000 for abulidlng and the re-
maining $8,600,000 to be spent re-
cruiting a “top notch faculty and
for maintenance expenses,” pc-
cording to Mr. Machesney.

Solving One Problem

One obstacle was~“land.” How-
ever with the assistance of the
Pittsburgh Redevelopment Author-
ity property is now in the process
of being acquired.

Also in 1948, $2,000,000 was
raised to apply to a new medical
school, with an additional ‘$2,500,-
000 acquired for the purpose of
constructing the George Clapp Sci-
ence Hall, but there again land was
a problem. This was recently
solved when the University was
given the property on Fifth Ave-
nue, across from the Cathedral,
which is now being used as a park-

ing lot. This site will be used for

the science hall and according to
Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald,
other buildings will be ‘placed
there eventually.

The property was given to the
University by the Mellon Fund
and has an appraised value of
$675,000.

, Engineering Boosted

A new engineering school came
closer to being a reality in 1948
when $1,200,000 was received for
that purpose. This building is al-
ready under construction, and will
be located between the Old Mellon
Building and Thaw Hall.

In the fall campaign of 1952
$7,000,000 was raised from Pitts-
burgh industries to be used in the
construction of a new School of
Medicine. Mr. Machesney said that
this grant represents the greatest
support for medical purposes that
industries have ever given, any-

Rabbi Finds Hope for Future
In Realistic Approach to Ills

By RUTH HEHVIBUECHER. ~ 6

Our world changes‘ around
us, physically, politically, cul-
turally, economically. All of
these changes, both evident,

and not—so—evident, will form
the basis for discussion during this

, year’s Religion-in-Life conference.

Rabbi Solomon Freehof of R0-
def Shalom Temple has seen more
of our changing world than most
of us. Last spring, he and his
wife, Lillian,
Europe and Israel. They saw the
changes of wars, of policies, of
society. '

’It is appropriate, then, that
Rabbi Freehof address students
at Religion—in-Life convocation,
Feb. 22. The theme of Religion-

"in—Life this year is “I Confront
a Changingvworld.”

Reﬂecting on the plastic face of
Europe, Rabbi Freehof says, "‘We
think of Europe as dejected and
hopeless. From one point of view
it is the reverse.

‘fzsaiice and Italy have enorm-

nations are not panicky. They
have tamed the revolutionary
movement and turned it into‘ a
p.oli’:ical party. Communism al-
ways threatens, but never quite
‘makes it in France and Italy.” 

Ho observes a different atti-

' tudo in England. “All the devo-
ftion of England to historical‘
pageant:-y explains the English
mood. They love the past be-
caiise it proves how much the

En~_':'iish lived through. Th e

courage of the past is their guar-

antee of conﬁdence in the fu-
tube.”

In Israel, neglected for _ 1500
years, the Freehofs found “a fer-
ment of change.” The barren hill-
sides of Judea were being planted
with trees. The land was becom-
ing a garden spot. “This is re-
markable,” says Rabbi Freehof,
“because this changing world in
Palestine is achieved by a little
people surrounded by a hostile
Arab world that seeks its destruc-
tion. But they are courageous and
have the joy of seeing _the results
of their efforts every day.”

Applying th e- macroeosmic
characteristics of the European

traveled throughl I

RABBI SOLOMON FREEHOF
He saw our changing world
as use #

crocosm of the individual, Dr.
Freehof comments, ‘‘__The individ-
ual must frankly face present-
A day events and control them as

France and -Italy are doing. He
must respect the courage of the
past from which he will draw
his streiigtli, as the English do.
He must pile up achievements to
be assured of his own solidarity
as the Israeli do.” After a pause,
Dr. Freehof adds, “This is the
character that can meet the fu-
ture.” .

“I confront a Changing World”
is a significant theme for Religion-
in-Life, Drgélreehof believes, since
“young people always think in
terms of ‘Me and the World’.”

He cautions, however, that “a
person can be in the world and out
of it.” He who resigns from the
world can be recognized immedi-
ately. That person “sees” every-
thing is wrong, no statesman is to
be trusted, and destruction is in-
evitable, implying that the wise
ones, like him, will stay out of it?’

The person whose inward life
is in harmony with the necessi-
ties of the ‘world does not de-
lude himself about harsh reali-
ties. “He believes in the value
of hopefulness andin the possi-

eountries to the comparative mi-

Our changing world will be

Freehof
thinks, since “people in their teens
and early twenties are deeply in-
terested in religion, even when
they are violently opposed to it.
Pro or con, their ‘opinions are
strong.” ‘
Youngsters, he points out, ac-
cept religion when.it is brought to
them, as they accept everything
’else.. Oldsters form a settled habit
toward religion, either regular
worship or regular neglect.

“Only young people are in a
state of decision. Therefore, the
discussions in Religion-in-Life
come at the right time in the life
of , the individual and they may
very well help determine the
direction of many personal ca-

Despair and indifference are
taught by the changing world
around us. “Hope and conﬁdence
require a conscientious effort, and
that effort is religion.”

where in the world.
Merger Considered

Within the next few weeks it
will be determined whether the
medical school shall incorporate
the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry,
Nursing, and Pharmacy. If it is
decided to put all of these schools
under one roof, the cost of the
building will increase from the
present approximation of $12,000,-
000 to $15,000,000, according to
Mr. Machesney.

He added, however that the dif-
ference of $3,000,000 will be ob-
tained if at least $500,000 is given
by industry since several unnamed
sources have promised to top in-
dustry’s amount with $2,500,000.

A more recent addition to the
University development is the
opening of the $4,500,000 Nurses’
Residence. The money used there
was acquired in a fund raising
campaign. The $1,500,000 Memo-
rial Fieldhouse is also a recent ad-
dition and the New York Life In-
surance Company ﬁnanced its con-

struction.

leaders could be approved, in that
school spirit needs a shot in the
arm.” He cited the unsatisfactory
spirit in winter sports, especially
basketball.

Previous Failures ‘Default’

Referring to the failure of stu-
dent leaders to attend meetings of
the faculty-student committee,
mentioned, Capt. Hamilton said
that previous decisions against
women cheerleaders have been by
“default.”

As for administration, he felt
that Pitt Pistols, the spirit-build-
ing organization advised by As-
sistant to the Dean of Men Jack
Hardman, would be most effective
fortraining women since it has
trained the men cheerleaders in

the past. Hamilton emphasized
that the~ﬁnal decision rested with
the women’s department, but that
the responsibility for costumes and
instruction could be handled by
the athletic department.
Sam Balk ‘Jubilant’

Sam Balk, head cheerleader last
year and originator of the “Balk

Referendum,” was jubilant over"

the apparent success of the student
poll and told the Pitt News, “I be-
lieve that the student referendum
sponsored by SC, proves beyond a
doubt, that an overwhelming ma-
jority of the undergraduate stu-
dents of Pitt want to see women
cheerleaders here." The graduate
continued, “I feel very convinced
that this move will further in-
crease and improve school spirit.“

According to Piemme, the book

At present MC is trying to get

goes through it will reopen next

Nice to see that the women cheerleaders project and
referendum was accepted by the students. The idea has been
battered from pillar to post and from one organization to an-
other for the past ﬁve years and we hope it will succeed

this time. Sam Balk and his commitee deserve praise for
their capable and sincere handling of the referendum heldf
, during registration, which proved that a substantial ma-

jority of both male and female students want to_,“give wom-

en students the opportunity to become cheerleaders.” The‘

success or failureof the project now rests with the women
themselves and the Women’s Self-Government Association.

. The Athletic Department has already agreed to help estab-

lish, the proper training programand furnish necessary uni-

forms.cA woman member of the University staff has agreed T

to serve as advisor and mentor for the coeds. And a number

5 of women have already expressed their desire to partici-

Student Congress has accomplished the spade work

i and furnished the means and ways for the enactment of the

proposal. We hope WSGA will realize their part in this
operation and grant the necessary approval or backing, if
indeed either is needed, and contribute to the cause. This
same WSGA voted down the proposal last year and it was
believed that this represented a majority -viewpoint of Uni-

By Alice Smolkovich ‘
Before you read this, suppose you spend a few
minutes thinking about the subject for this year’s
Religion-in—Life Conference, “I Confront a Chang-

ing ‘World.’? I’ve thought about
it since the theme was chosen by
a student-faculty committee last
August; and, just when I’ve be-
. gun to feel that there’s enough

to give my interpretation of this
theme in one news column.

A Quick Glance

~-If you have been fair and col-
lected your ideas now, let" us '
glance at the world and see how much it is chang-
ing. Hemlines go up, then down‘; government shifts
from one party to another; we’ve progressed. from
arrows to hydrogen bombs (progressed, did I say?);
but, nevertheless, most of us manage to exist with-‘
out being troubled to any degree by the “chang-
ing time.s.\” Is that bad‘? Could be.

On the other hand, the best way to accept the
challenge’ of the times is to live as we believe and
believe as we live, and it’s not "as simple as it
sounds. Idealisticl? Maybe, but ideals can be prac-

~-»tical—-—in fact, they are nothing if not expressed

    

in the way we live-—and in the way we earn a»

living.~(Two different things, you see, if you con-
sidér that earning a living is what you get-, and
. liivng itself is what you give.)

Second Line of Defenise...

How Columnists Get Ideas . . .

 

  Belief In A Changingi World 

Ouestion ‘Yourself

While we are striving to become more educated,
we might take a test once given by a professor
in Chicago to his students. He told them theyiwere
not really educated unless they could say yes to
the following questions: “Has your education taught

you what it is to be a friend to yourself? Do you

see anything to love in a little child? Will a lonely
dog follow you down the street? Can you be
happy  the meaner drudgeries. of life? Do you
think washing dishes and hoeing corn just as com-
patible with high thinking »as piano playing or
golf? Are you good for anything to yourself?,
Can you be happy alone? Can youlook out in the
world and see anything but dollars and cents?,
Can you look into a mud puddle and see any-
thing in the puddle but mud?’ Can you look into
the sky at night and see beyond the stars? Can
your soul claim relationship with the Creator?’

Time. theeGreatest Teacher ‘

You’ve heard before that “what you are speaks
so loud l cannot hear a word you are saying.” Do
these ideas all seem like “old stuff?” They should.
And time, as the greatest tester and teacher, con-
tinues to prove their worth. Otherwise, they would
not be repeated so often. Otherwise, we wouldn’t
be spending these few days or using this space
to emphasize the religious principles by which we
live the other 362 days of the year.

John Henry Newman, who is portrayed in our

Heinz Chapel windows as a scholar and an educa-
tor, tells usnot to worrythat our lives will come

-to an end, but rather to fear that they will never

have a beginning. One of the strongest links in all
the World’s great religions is the principle that
as we give, to the world, so the world gives to us.
And as men change, so changes ‘the world.

dropped and the second engine is ﬁred. This two
step design accounts for the missile’s 2000 mile per
hour speed. ‘

Between the engine and the explosive »-warhead
of the missle is its brain. Nike has a high IQ. for,
with its radar andxelectronic calculators, it can
chase an enemy bomber up to altitudes of. 55,000
feet or more, accurately block all moves to es-
cape, and ultimately destroy the invader.
Needed Badly

A ring of these guided missiles’ is being placed
around Pittsburgh for, Pittsburgh would '3ertainly
be one of the prime industrial targets of an at-
tacking force, not to mention the staggering loss of

life which would result from an attack on a city

as large as“ ours.
The government and the _armed forces have
been trying for some time to awaken the populace

of America to the dire consequence of possible,

enemy attack within our borders, but the John Q.
Public remains lax and indiﬁerent to thethreat.
The people of Pittsbgrgh are, unfortunately, no
different from. their brothers through-out the rest
of the nation. ,

Grim Warning ’ .

Perhaps the installation of this grim watchdog
called Nike will serve to snap the false thread
of “it—can’t-happen-here” convictions which ‘have
been binding our awakening to reality.

Has No Complaints

Visitor From Bagdad

By GERRI ASH

At least one Pitt student doesn’t voice complaints about
dating difficulties as he sits drinking his coke in the Tuck
Shop. It might be because Nasoohi Ali Ghalib knows that
things are a lot worse in Bagdad.

According to Nasoohi, a student in the School of
Health, before a couple can evenO———- _
date in Bagdad, the parents of the
boy must meet with the girl’s par-
ents and arrange for an engage-
ment. After the couple is formally
engaged they begin the courtship.

But Arab young people are no
different than American youth,
admits Nasoohi, and every once
in a while Bagdad teenagers will
meet without permission in one
of the many crowded movie
houses.

Nasoohi,‘better known as Ned,
has come to the United States to
learn hospital administration. He
is a frequent moviegoer especially
to see Marilyn Monroe. Without
hesitation he says, “That woman
has everything.”

Entertainment in Bagdad is un-
limited. There are American
night clubs with traditional ﬂoor

Debators Win Again
Setting New Record

Pitt’s Men’s ‘Debate team

established a new record in

Pennsylvania Collegiate debatingxwhen they swept the Slip-
pery Rock State Teachers College Annual Cross-Exam1na-
tion Tourney last Saturday for the third consecutive year. .

The tournament argued ‘ the‘
question of Free Trade. The neg-
ative team for Pitt, Dan Purdy

and Tom Rutter, scored on two
of three rounds. The affirmative
team of Joe Trattner and Irving
Bloom made a clean ‘sweep of
their three chances.

In winning, Pitt defeated West-
minster, Allegheny, Grove City,
Duquesne, and Penn State. They
suffered their only defeat at the.
hands of Dickinson College whom
they had defeated last year in’ a
dual meet before city and district
high schools on the same issue.

The five wins at Slippery Rock
gives Men’s Debate a total record
of 69 victories against 24 loses for
the 753354 school term.

The win also gives them the

first big tournament triumph of
the season.. Although the team

won’ an Ohio State Tourney
earlier in theseason; they were
disqualiﬁed because of missing the
ﬁrst round of debates.

Next week Men’s Debate have
theirhelimination try-outs for the

Panthers Halted at Six;
Injury Decides Outcome

By PAUL HARRISON .

Michigan’s Wolverines made good use of an untimely

Pitt forfeit and three decisions to snap asix-match Panther
winning streak, 16-11, at Ann Arbor Monday.

The match’ was the ﬁfth between the two schools with

Michigan nowholding the edge, 3-2. Pitt was victorious in

the two previous campaigns.

Ronnie Kurtz, stellar 130-pounder, was unable to imeet

Michigan’s “Snip” Nalan due to an‘ '

injury suffered earlier this month
against Yale. The forfeit cost the
Panthers ﬁve points, the differ-
ence in the ﬁnal score.

Peery Gets 3-7th

Despite the disadvantage, the
Panthens mauled three of their op-
ponents and drew with another.
Hugh Peery, .. of Olympic fame,
chalked up his 3'l"ch straight by
decisioning FranklHirt in the 122-
pound class. Ed DeWitt took the
167-pound honors and George
Beresword, wrestling as a heavy-
weight for the first time, took the
measure of ,Michigan’s Bob Hur-
ley.

Pitt's Charley Uram tangled
with Mike Rodriguez in what was
the most evenly matched contest,
for it resulted in a 1-1 tie.

The Kurtz-Nalan match was ex-
pected to be the feature attraction.

formances in previous encounters
plus the fact’ that Nalan is Mich-
igan’s Big Ten and NCAA champ
in the 130-pound class. However,
after the usual pre—match warm-
up, Coach Rex Peery decided to
keep Kurtz under wraps to pre-
vent further aggravation of his
injury.
‘ Record Marred

Coach Peery’s grapplers earn-
ed their six in a row record by
downing Toledo 2-5-3, Michigan
State 21-9, Lehigh 21-8, Navy 15-
13, Yale 23-2, and Army 23-8. Be-
fore the Michigan reversal the
matmen had an enviable record of
22 victories out of 23 starts over
the past three seasons.

hers have been Peery, Uram, and

Uram’s record is marred by two

spite two forfeits against the
team, remains undefeated with

The overall collegiate records

Cut Indicated
In Bowl Tourney

By RUSS. FnAN_KE
Sports Editor

 

According to the latest Field House rumor, the quota
of Pitt student admissions may be reduced in. next year’s
Steel Bowl Tournament at the Field House.

In the past the quota has been set at 750, but because
of the almost negligible student representation this season,
athletic oﬁicials are pondering a possible cut based on cur-
rent attendance ﬁgures.

It has not been determined deﬁnitely whether such a
plan will materialize, or whether students from co-host Du-
quesne will be affected if it does, but the mere suggestion
reﬂects the disappointment of the Field House minions.

The reasoning behind any forthcoming reduction
is simple. When tournament time rolls around, the ticket
office receives such a ﬂood of customers with hard, green
cash that many of them have to be turned away. Stu-
dents, too, turn outen masse, but most of them are not
the “old faithfuls” who follow the team regularly. Offi-
cials obviously feel that these occasionals are not really
interested in seeing Pitt play but, rather, are drawn by
a fascination for Duquesne’s winning ways.

It’s not fair to the pocketbook, in other words, inasmuch
as several hundred student seats, occupied by bargain hunt-
ers, could have gone to more deserving Pittsburghers.

Upon being questioned about the quota problem, Frank
Carver, graduate manager of athletics, was quick to point
out that the suggested cut deﬁnitely was not proposed as a
penalty for poorattendance. ,

_ It is only logical to assume, he‘ indicated, that the
average attendance at regular games should be the only
real gauge in judging the number of basketball fans who‘
are enrolled here. And when special attractions come
up, student attendance ﬁgures offer the only clue as to
the number of‘, students who will be interested.

“We realize,” he said, “that a lot of students work in the evenings
or ' have some other activity that keeps them busy‘. Then, too, that
long climb up the hill has a lot to do with it, especially where girls
are concerned.

“That’s why only a hundred or so can attend the games.
The ones who do attend are the real faithfuls, though.”

He is right ' on all counts. Many people agree that a large
majority of students at a city school like Pitt have to work either
part time or full time. And scaling that hill is hard ‘even on _an
athlete. - ' .

From allindications, though, the Field House will not‘ be empty

Intramural Sport

Action Resumes

‘With’ the opening of the In-
tramural basketball season less
than a week away, IM sports are
approachihg full swing for the
spring semester. -

According to IM Director Leo
Bemis, the fraternities will be
ready to take to the court on
Monday or Tuesday, at the lat-
est, with schedules due to come
out sometime this week.

This week lmay also ﬁnd the
frat volleyball picture winding
up, after being discontinued by
the recess.

Bemis also announced that en-
tries are still open for All—Cam—
pus wrestling and the open
squash singles. .

Fencers Exhibit
Form Here Today,

This afternoon at 4:30 a fenc-
ing exhibition will -be staged in
the Cathedral Gym for anyone
interested in the sport.

Two expert fencers, David

‘Mcconaughy and William ‘Rowe,

will be present to demonstrate
various aspects of the sport as
well _as explain the equipment
used.

_So far, quite a few students
have expressed an interest, both
boys and girls, and it is hoped
that enough support is shown to
merit a fencing program on a
club basis-—open to all students
in the future.
