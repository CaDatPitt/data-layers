Seeks Theme Song V

“Engineer Me Calling Caroline”
may not be such a good pun but at
least it started something among the
engineers. Members of the Engineer-
ing Association want to sing. If they
don’t want to sing, they do want a
song,’ and they want it so badly that
the EA is willing to pay ﬁve dollars
for it. _

A contest being held by the EA
fromgnow ‘until the Penn State game
offers the ﬁve dollar prize for _a song
that will serve as a theme for the
engineering school. Although no
limitations have been made, it is sug-
gestedthat a spirited melody, ‘either
original_ or taken from another -song,-
should be submitted. .

William McQuad»e, CE37; Robert
Duncan, ‘C-hE37, and Guy Horvath,
AE38, will be the judges of the con-
test. All entries should be given to
either the judges, the office of the

By Robert Saffron

In the last article it was shown
that the professors of political science
did not see exactly eye to eye. And
now we discover that the teachers

of economics disagree with the history -

experts and among themselves. -

Dr. Marion K. McKay, professor-

of _the department of economics," ‘be-.
lieves that it is a question of increas-
ing;-ithe. security and freedom of the
people. He says:

“The broad and outstanding lis-
sue ‘underlying this campaign ,is
whether we are willing that the
instrumentalities of our democratic
government shall continue to be
used to provide andlultimotely in-
sure the greatest possible .measure
of security and genuine freedom
for all our people.

Russel Dixon, instructor in eco-
nomics, sees four main differences in
propositions:

"One: The conflict between the

-ernment on the part of Democrats
and the return to the minimum or

By William Stark

Some 48 hours hence, at -least
two persons in one of two par-

and at least two persons in the
other party will radiate exuber-
ance. James» A. Farley and
President Roosevelt are likely
to enjoy pleasant moments of
triumph, if The Pitt News “poll
is an indication.

With complete returns available in
the poll conducted in collaboration
with the Pittsburgh Press and “Amer-

though his total vote is lower than
it was several weeks ago.

Pharmacy School Votes

The School of Pharmacy, which
was not included in the ﬁrst poll,
gave the President 58 per cent of
its votes; Governor Landon garnered
35 per cent, Norman Thomas, ﬁve
per cent, and the other candidates re-
ceived the remainder.

Seniors in -the -Pharmacy School

Pitt‘ Begins Preparations
For Penn State Game,
Homecoming Next

 

Coach Jock Suthe'rland’s football
squad returned yesterday.
In New York over the past week-

end the Panthers gavetthe Gotham-

ites a few~..Pittsburgh angles onithis
game of football, but learned as many
in return. They put up a great
battle, showed’ sustained power in
spots, but each time when a touch-
down seemed certain the attack would
bog-down, thanks primarily to an en-
tire Fordham eleven that lived up
to all its capabilities.

This week the squad settles down
to the task -of preparing for Penn
State’s homecoming invasion next
Saturday. The Nittany Lion saw red
against the Syracuse Orange, but the
wise money will bet that the ‘Pan-
ther scoring power returns with a
bang, following the Ram pointless
deadlock.

Sutherland Power Gains

The entire squad is in pretty fair
condition, according to an after-game
check-up by Dr. Bud Moore, portly
trainer and builder-upper. Saturday’s
play, was rough, tough, but as in
the Ohio State game, the ﬁeld was
strewn with home town boys, indi-
cating that the invading Panther hit
hard and often during the afternoon.

Jimmy Crowley’s Rose -Bowl hopes
were kept alive as the result of the
off-Broadway doings; for the moral
victory, if there was one, belonged
to the Rams in successfully checking
the favored Pitt drives in vital
stages. _ _

With the exception of a late fourth-
period Ram assault, Sutherland spin-
ners and reverses stole the show. On
several occasions the Pittsburghers
started to roll down ﬁeld for several
sustained marches, once narrowly
missing the touchdown stop by a yard
that looked as big as a Nebraskan
cornﬁeld.

Passes appeared to be getting
places three times during the play,
but each time the spark missed the
pay-off wire.

Pitt and Fordham have now played
two consecutive scoreless ties in the
two-game series, repeating last year’s
feat.

The East is in even a worse mud- '

dle today than it was one week ago,
so far as leadership is concerned.
Just which team should ‘be on top
is hard to say, but it is recognized
that two of the best spent most of the
afternoon in the Polo Grounds de-
ciding little more than was decided
last year at the same event.

Students To Air
Views At Forum

A political meeting without a poli-
tician. This is the novel situation
that will confront Inquiry Forum
goers today at 12:30 o’clock in Room
107, Alumni Hall, wherean open

 

 

A forum on the election will beheld.

Under the name of “The S-tudent
Speaks,” the meeting will offer Stu-.
dents an opportunity to ‘engage in
a last minute discussion of the men
and ;issues concerned in the presiden-
tial campaign. 'A special objective
of the forum will be to discover why
people vote the way they do.

“The program,” according to Ed
Van Kirk, C37," co—chairman of In-
quiry Forum, “was planned to give
students, whether voters or not, a
chance to express their own opinions
rather than listen to the stereo-
typed and often" superﬂuous ‘remarks
of campaign speakers.”

Albert Spiegel, C37,'will act as
chairman of the program. He will
be assisted by several campus lead-
ers well acquainted with the political
questions before the country. The
stud‘ents’will include, according to
tentative -plans, Robert McKee, C38;
Robert Saffron-, ‘C38; Morton Blue-
stone,_C38; Thomas Dillon, C37 ; Sid-
ney Horovitz, C37, an_d several.oth'ers.

You may have your own idea about
the coming presidential election, but
the rambling reporter hits the high
spots to ﬁgure the University’s~lea=ri-
ing in tomorrow’s scramble.

From basements to chimney tops
he gallops, trying to “Land—on" a
prospective voter. Most of them
weren’t eligible but were willing
enough to voice their opinion.

The ﬁrst group have their ups and
downs, bu.t they’re willing to stick to
Roosevelt. You guessed it——-the
Cathedral elevator boys.

The candid candy man informed
me in badly shattered English that
what America needs today is a good
four-cent candy bar. (There ought
to be a “bar room” somewhere in the
platforms.) .

Round for Roosevelt, lean for Lan-
don seems to be the trend among
ladies and gentlemen of those pro-
porti-ons. . We hope it has nothing
to do with the lean and fat years
of their presidency.

“If the steak is too tough for you,

Women Learn’ Football
In an attempt to give new -'

women students a better under-
standing of football, Coach Allison
of the University of California, re-
cently spoke on “Football and How
to. Enjoy It.”

Expressing his opinion of the
woman’s place where football is
concerned, Allison said: “A woman"
is a good inﬂuence so long as the
player doesn't get that ‘far-away’
look in his eye when he is on the
field. But marriage isn’t much of
a handicap.”

Of Harvard, Yesterday
And Today

There is a new book -that came off"

the presses at the beginning of Sep-
tember called “Was College Worth
While?” The author, John R. Tunis,
was a member of the Harvard class
of 1911. The book is an analysis of
Harvard of Yesterday and the gfadu-
ates Today. V

Mr. Tunis compiled his history
from a series of lengthy question-
naires, given tot the class of '11.
According to tradition, the class
publishes every ﬁve years a series
of brief personal his-tories. It was
the set published in 1931 that set
Mr. Tunis thinking. He wanted to
know. how these ‘classmates were
getting along now, what their per-
sonal views were, of what their
personal and social and political
life was constituted.

The volume “Was College Worth
While?” is the answer. The "author
finds that half of his classmates are
disappointed in their lif-e work, that
the average earned income is under
$5,000. One graduate wrote, “They
call her Dame Fortune. She’ll be
Grandma Fortune before I catch
her.” Another claimed that he was

a complete failure, “,mora.lly, mental- i

ly, and ﬁnancially.”

The author concludes that the class
of 1911 had failed. Some had
achieved some minor success: wives,
children, and a meager salary trying
to stretch itself between a family of
four. Others had failed completely
and didn’t hesitate to mention it.

summer, I had the opportunity to
cross the river to Cambridge and
to see the campus——no, we mustrft
call it the “campus.” It is the
“Yard,” and every Harvard man
insists that it is the Yard and noth-
ing else———of the school named in
the legacy of the mystical ﬁgure
John Harvard.

The guide service of the ter-
centenary takes the visitor on a
tour of the Yard and through
several of the houses. Overlooking
the Yard is the statue of John
Harvard. On the right hand base
of the statue is the Harvard em-
blem, with the motto “Veritas-—

In the Agassiz Museum of the Uni-
versity is the Ware Collection of the
Bl-ashka Glass Models of Plants. The
collection is the work of two men,

Rudolpf and Leopold Blashka of

Dresden, Germany." When Professor
G. L. Goodale, in charge of ’-‘the

 

Botanical Museum, wanted to make

‘a permanent collection for the Uni-

versity, a collection that would be
distinct and appealing to popular in-
terest, he heard of the Blashkas, Leo-
pold, the father, and Rudolph, the
son. They were known for their ex-
quisite workmanship in glass, and had
done several exhibits of Coelenterata
in that diﬂicult: medium;

Goodale, after several trips to
Dresden, ﬁnally contracted them to
prepare. an extensive exhibit for the
museum. -

Rudolph Blashka, the son, made a.
trip to South America and to the
Western United States to obtain
studies of plants for T his‘ models.
While in Am-erica, he was summoned
home"by the news of the death of
his father.

In 1924, the work on the last

tion on exhibition contains speci-
mens illustrating 164 families of
ﬂowering plants, a selected group
Of cryptograms, illustrating com-
plicated life histories, a group of
models illustrating insect pollina-
tion.

The exhibition is more than re-
markable. The ﬁne details of the
ﬂowers and plants, delicate shades

Pitt, F ordligm Play

Second Scoreless Tie

Pitt Team Makes 51-Yard March To Ram 3-Yard Line
In Only Serious Scoring Threat Of Even Game As
“Battle Of Lines” Plays Before 57,000

East is East

West is West
But speaking of football
The East is a mess.

There’s s-ome mighty bad

p-oetry there, but there is also

some mighty sound reasoning. And nothing would go to prove
that more than a glance at Saturday’s Eastern football results.
With Pitt and Fordham battling it out in a scoreless tie up in

New York, no less than four unde-"

feated elevens dropped from the
Eastern prospective grid title holders
league.

Army, Holy Cross, Yale, and Villa-
nova were whipped for the ﬁrst time
while P1'ince-ton, formerly beaten by
Penn, was being held to a surprise
14-14 deadlock at Harvard. It seems
the only plausible thing to do now is
declare Padooka U. from Bittersville
the Eastern football leaders.

Coach Jimmy Crowley, who coach-
es 3. football team up there in
New York somewhere, really knew
what he was talking about last week
when he modestly claimed his Ford-
ham Rams to have “the best defen-
sive line he had ever seen.”

It might not be the best defensive
line ever thrown together but it did
right well by itself and when the
Panthers and Rams walked off the
Polo Grounds Saturday there was the
score all bun-dled up and neatly tied
with a 0-0 card on it for the sell—out
crowd of 57,000 fans. Mr. Crowley
and Mr. Sutherland might have saved
a little worry just by looking at last
year’s ﬁnal for that was the 1935
score.

Panthers Begin Power Drive

But the game didn’t need the scor-
ing to make it one of the best games
ever to be played here in New York.
It was a battle of two great lines———
smashing, slashing, with each saving
enough to hold off that last touch-
down putsch. Of the two, the Pan-
thers had the scoring opportunities
of the day. Late in the third period
with Goldberg, LaRue and Patrick
banging at the Ram line, the Suther-
land Scythe mowed all the way down
to the 3-yard line only to be stopped
short of a ﬁrst down by a yard.

It was this drive, starting from the
Pitt 45-yard line, that was the out-
standin.g part of the game. Four
straight ﬁrst downs carried the ball
down to the F0-rdham 4-yard line
where it was fourth and two. Bobby
LaRue, who played one of the best
games he has ever played, slashed
through left tackle but was stopped
cold by big Alec Wojciechowicz, the
outstanding man on the Ram line.

Strange as it seems, Fordham
seemed to feel pretty chipper over
the tie game, while the Panthers were
a very disappointed lot. After the
game" the Ram fans howled and
hooted, tore up the two goal posts
and marched all over the ﬁeld where
the Fordham men a short while be-
fore had found it plenty tough
marching. It was the Rams ﬁrst mar
on an otherwise perfect record.

‘Biggie’ Runs 27 Yards

Aside from the one Panther 51-
yard march the game offered many
thrills but few scoring chances.
When the few scoring chances did
show, the Panthers were on the heavy
end. Two minutes before the end of
the ﬁrst half the Pitt lads shoved out
three straight ﬁrst downs, going down
to the Fordham 30-yard line. “Big-
gie” Goldberg, hounded all after-
noon, went around left end for 27
yards before Andy Palau, the last
Ram man in the way, downed him.
Then Goldberg slung two 10-yard
passes, one to Daddio and one to La-
Rue, to put the ball on the 30-yard
line. LaRue’-s‘ pass was then inter-
cepted by Franco.

On the kickoff starting the second
half, LaRue grabbed the ball on his
own ﬁve-yard line and steamed
right up the center of the ﬁeld for 41
yards before being met head-on by
Andy Palau, again the last Ram man
in the way of deserted yard stripes.

Two other Panther opportunities
in the ﬁrst half, a Fordham pass in-
tercepted by Don Hensley on the Ram
45-yard line and Curly Stebbins’ re-
covery of a Fordham fumble on the
35-yard line, both looked good but
ﬁzzled out when the Rams braced.

A Tame Flock?

Oifensively the Rams had more
yards to show for rushing at the end
of the game, but most of their gains
were made in their own territory. The
closest Panther approach to the Pan-
ther goal came mid-way in the ﬁnal
quarter when the Rams butted down
to the Panther 30-yard line. Outside
of this they were a pretty tame flock
of Rams so far as butting activities
were concerned.

Goldberg, LaRue, Stapulis and Pat-
rick all looked good at times in the
Pitt backﬁeld with LaRue the best
threat and the most consistent. On
the line there was hardly a standout
with the exception of Biff Glassford,
acting captain, but they all played
good ball most of the way. Fordham
leaders were Palau and Dulkie as
ball-carriers, and Wojciechowicz and
Barbatsky on the line.

Statistically, the game wound up
around the even-Stephen mark, too.
Pitt had the edge in ﬁrst downs, nine
to eight, but it lost out in yards

Swimmers

Show Class
At Practice

Red McQuillan, Bill Brown
Show Surprising Form
On Springboard

 

 

There are plenty of ﬁne swimmers
splashing through the waters of the
Trees Gym pool after 5:00 o’clock
each afternoon. The natators are
slicing through the water under the
direction of Pat Corr and his as-
sistant, Russ Lindberg, who said that
the boys are gradually rounding into
shape and should be ready for their
ﬁrst meet some time after the ﬁrst
week of January.

Among those showing form are
two divers of high calibre. Red Mc-
Quillan, a veteran of last year, is
being chased for the springboard
honors by Bill Brown, a sophomore.
Brown is also a possible free-styler
on the relay quartet.

Among the free-style sprinters are
Walt Nowatnay, “Major” Heiple, Bob
Keck and Herman Laub. Nowatnay is
developing especially fast and should
win plenty of points for Pitt this
year. Keck and Laub are two sopho-
mores who did not go near the water
last year, but are proving to be capa-
ble men in their event. Bernie De-
lake and Tom Anderson, back-stroker
and breast-stroker, respectively, are
proving the best available in their
events.

Lalor Shows Stuff!

Among the freshmen capable of
forcing the water to ﬂow by at great
speed are Alan Dill and Bob Schra-
der, both short-distance free-stylers.

There is another freshman up there -

who when he ﬁrststarted was the
slowest man out for the sport. Al-
though still among the slower class,
it appears that he will not remain
with them long. From doing a hun-
dred yards in the unbelievable slow
time of four minutes he has cut it
down to a little more than sixty sec-
onds. Which speaks well for Jim La-
lor, the swimmer, and Patt Corr, the
coach.

Although the varsity has two divers
of class in McQuillan and Brown,
the yearlings as yet have failed to
provide any board men. Russ Lind-
berg has asked that all freshmen pos-
sessing some ability on the board
come up and practice with the team.

According to a tentative schedule
the natators will ﬁnd two strangers
to test their water ability on the
schedule this year in the form of
Ohio Wesleyan and Western Reserve.
These two schools have never been
entertained by the Panther swimmers.
Other more familiar aggregations in-
clude Slippery Rock, Temple, Penn
State, Army, Brooklyn and Delaware.
To this list of opponents Pat Corr
hopes to add two more to be met in
foreign waters.

ing 154 to the Panthers’ 145.

yards to the Ra1n’s 15. About the
only thing uneven was the band sit-
uation, with the Pitt band once more
showing New York that it has “some-
thing there” in the way of mid-period
maneuvering.

F rosh Eleven Defeats Nittany
Cubs With Passing Attack, 13-6

 

Cassiano Scores In First,
Third Quarters, Ewalt
Makes Lion Tally

 

This seems to be getting a Pitt
habit! Last year at this time the
Panther varsity returned from New
York with a scoreless Fordham tie.
Yesterday they returned with an-
other. Last year the Panther fresh-
man football team licked Penn State
after losing their ﬁrst two games.
And the same thing happened on the
gridiron last Saturday afternoon at
Shadyside with the Pitt Frosh grid-
ders sending an invading Penn Stat!»
eleven back to Mount Nittany at the
tail end of a 13-6 score.

Unleashing a dangerous passing at-
tack much the same as that used
against Kiski two weeks ago, the Pan-
ther yearlings paved the way for two
scores, ﬁrst in the opening quarter
and again in the third quarter, with
Cassiano crossing the goal line both
times. Pastin added the extra point
in the third stanza with a placement.

After being held at bay for three
quarters, the Penn State Frosh came
through in the last quarter to chalk
up six points when Dick Ewalt, for-
mer Mt. Lebanon high school star,
broke loose around right end for a
45-yard sprint.

The Pitt Cubs repeated last year's
record of dropping the ﬁrst games to
the Tech Plebes and Kiski and com-
ing back to down the Nittany Lion
Cubs for the ﬁrst win of the year.
This makes the third successive year
that Penn State Frosh have ended
up on the small end of the score.

Fijis Defeat PiKA Eleven;
Greek Tourney Enters
Second Round Play

Flashing the best offense of the
early interfraternity touch football
season, Phi Gamma Delta passed into
the second round of the Greek tour-
ney by trouncing the brothers of Pi
Kappa Alpha, 13-0, on Trees Gym
ﬁeld last Thursday.

Bill Schenk, all-fraternity guard
last year, tossed a 25-yard pass to
Trackman Dick Mason, who ran the
remaining 20 yards down the ﬁeld for
the ﬁrst score late in the second
period. In the next period the Fijis
socked away the game as easily as
they socked away 16 pledges last
rushing season when the combine of
Erickson to Art William was good
for 20 yards and the second touch-
down.

There was no serious threat by the
PiKAs, but Ray Light was a shining
light in the losing team’s play. By
virtue of this victory the Phi Gam’s
move into the second round against
Sigma Alpha Mu, winners of a bye.
This game is to be played tomorrow
at 4 o’clock at the Schenley Oval.

Kappa Sigma, defending champion,
plays its ﬁrst game of the year when
it meets Pi Lambda Phi today. This
is the last game of the ﬁrst-round
bracket. It will be played at 4 o’clock
at the Oval, which is the chief stamp-
ing ground of the Greek play.

Martin J. Feely, director of Intra-
mural athletics, announced today the
formation of an independent league.
League members are the Newman
Club, Kappa Alpha Phi, Trackers and
the Bizads. First game on their
schedule is carded for this afternoon
at 4 o’clock on the Trees Field be-
tween Newman Club and Kappa Al-
pha Phi.

Still in the formative process are

Olympic Track Stars
Feature Novice Party

 

Glenn Morris, Decathlon Champ, Johnny Woodruff Tell
Of Berlin Summer Experiences On Track

 

By Leonard Levison

Glen Morris, Olympic decathlon champion, helped make
Coach Olson’s annual party for the novice track and ﬁeld meet
winners Wednesday a strictly Olympic affair by stepping up
to the speaker’s rostrum and answering a cascade of questions
about his part in the 11th Olympiad.

Morri-s, who by his record-break-xv

ing performance in Berlin las-t sum-
mer earned the title of the “world’s
most versatile athlete,” landed in
Pi-ttsburgh Wednesday. One of the
ﬁrst things he did was to taxi over
to the Pitt athletic building to visit

his Olympic friend, Carl Olson.
Coach Olson promptly drafted him
for the track party he was throwing
the same evening.

Strikingly handsome, intelligent,
and smooth-speaking, Morris gave his
ideas on a great many track and ﬁeld
technicalities in answering the ques-
tions of the varsity, freshmen, and
novice trackmen. His procedure
through the ten different events that
make-up the decathlon was carefully
detailed.

Roots For Pitt

The former Colorado State cinder
star told of how a victory in the 400-
meter hurdles of the Junior A. A. U.
championships whetted his desire for
a place on the United States Olympic
team, how he prepared for that place
by a year of extensive training, and
how, as he stood on the winning
platform to receive the greatest ova-
tion of the games, his greatest joy at
the moment was caused by the fact
that “the good old U. S. A. had
placed one, two, and three.”

He also paid tribute to Pitt’s
great Olympic champion, Johnny
Woodruﬂ’, and deplored the fact that
one of the downtown Pittsburgh
papers mi s qu o t e (1 him on the
outcome of the Pitt-Fordham game.
That paper quoted him as picking

Johnny Woodruﬂ’ was called upon
by his teammates to explain a per-
plexing part of his Olympic victory.
It seems that there had been some
dispute about Woodruif’s salute on
the victory stand. He raised his hand
out in Nazi fashion, then snapped
into a United States army salute. The
American papers said, “Woodruif
Salutes the World.”

Johnny cleared up the matter by
pointing out that, on that victory
stand, he was more nervous than at
any other time during the entire
games. When he saw the flag going
up and everyone stretching out their
hands, he did likewise. Suddenly it
occurred to him that this wasn’t right,
and he snapped into a brisk American
military salute.

Complete Olympic motion pictures
were then shown by Assistant Coach
Jimmy Potts. Refreshments ended
up the evening with the novice win-
ners getting an extra helping.

Maintains
High Level

Research Bureau’s Review
For October Indicates
Steady Trade Rise

Business in the Pittsburgh district
is maintaining its highest level in six
years, the October review of the
Bureau of Business Research of the
University shows.

The volume of business in 1936 up
to October 15 was about 95 per cent
normal. A year ago business was 71
per cent normal, and two years ago,

53 per cent normal. ' .

Pointing out that the annual fall
pickup of business came early this
year, Dr. Ralph Watkins of the Bu-
reau says that the rate of increase
from now on may fall somewhat short
of the usual gains.

Iron and steel activity in the Pitts-
burgh district has been well sus-
tained, although there has been a
slight decline in the last two weeks.
The Bureau report indicates, how-
ever, that iron and steel mills will be
working at a high rate at least until
the end of the year.

Coal Production High

Bituminous coal productionin Sep-
tember was the largest since March,
1935. Sales of electric power to in-_
dustries reached a new high, while
polished plate: glass production, al-
though still ahead of the 1935 record,
declined slightly. ‘

Retail sales in the district rose in
September and October, with sales
prospects for the rest of the ‘year the
best since 1930. Department store
sales were nearly 15 per cent above
those for the same four-week period
ending October 17.

An article by Theodore Veenstra
in the review points out that rents
have increased in the last year, but
are still lower than in 1934.

Mr. Veenstra shows that average
rental rates declined in the extreme
low-rental groups from $5 to $10.

Most re ntals show increases.
Rentals for homes priced from $40
to $100 per month advanced slightly
more than 2 per cent.- Mr. Veen-
stra’s survey also shows that more
houses in the extreme upper and low-
er brackets are vacant than in the
intermediate group.

Workmen Hunt Meter
In Cathedral Grass

There is only one way to reach
a water meter pit and that is to dig
down to it. This is precisely what
the University workmen are doing
near the Fifth Avenue entrance to
the Cathedral. Result-—the bare
spot instead of the beautiful green
grass.

A few days will ﬁnd the spot lush
and green again. A few minor
changes will have been made to the
meter pit.

Hance Re-Elected

Dr..Robert T. Hance, professor of A

biology, has been reelected president
of the Biology Teachers’ Club of
Western Pennsylvania.
Dr. Hance will edit “Nature,Notes
for Western Pennsylvania,” monthly
publication of the organization. Bi-
ology teachers in Western Pennsyl-
vania high schools are members of
the club.

Candidates See 

ariety Of Issues In Election

Farley Sees Young Voters
Championing Roosevelt

(Ed. Note: The News has attempted
to secure statements from all the Dresi-
dential candidates in the present cam-
paign. All candidates have submitted
statements except Earl_Browder, the
Communist Party candidate, and D.
Leigh Colvin, the Prohibition candidate.
The statements on this page are ex-
cerpts of the statements received. Lack
of space prevents complete statements
The statements were collected and put
together by William Stark, political
editor of The Pitt News. _

The statement directly following was
prepared by James Farley, chairman
of the Democratic National Committee.
President Roosevelt does not submit
statements to individual publications.)

In the ﬁnal analysis the issue to-
morrow is whether the American peo-
ple want a continuation of the New
Deal with President Roosevelt as its
administrator. These policies, as all
of us know, have lifted the United
States from the depths of the deepest
depression in the history of the na-

ion.

It is, of course, deeply gratifying
that the ﬁrst voters of the nation are
supporting President Roosevelt this
year in such numbers. The truth is
that the college man and woman has
found in President Roosevelt and his
administration a champion of right
against might. They see in the Pres-
ident a defender of human rights
against property rights, a supporter
of people against privilege.

L”a ‘n do n Decries Go 22 ’ t
Direction Of Business

 

(Ed. Note: The following statement
is part of a speech made by Gov. Alf
Landon, Republican Party candidate,
before a meeting of Youth Conference
at Topeka, Kansas, on September 18.)

This is no ordinary campaign in
which we are engaged. It is a cam-
paign that cuts across all party lines.
Today the issue is the kind of govern-
ment, and the kind of country, we
are to have in the years to come.

The real issue as we see it is this:

The present administration believes
that there is no future for this coun-
try. It has accepted the idea that
we have reached our peak—that ahead
of us is a large standing army of
unemployed; that, in consequence, the
government must play a greater and
greater part in managing the details
of our daily lives instead of conﬁning
itself to the expanding ﬁeld of regu-
Iation in the public interest.
A The Republican Party, on the other
hand, utterly rejects this philosophy.
It believes. that America still is on
the upgrade, that we can eliminate
unemployment, that the government
should tighten the rules governing
business, butvshould not attempt to
manage business; that, in a word,
America will once again be a nation
where youth can be conﬁdent of its
future.

Socialist Leader Envisions

War,’ Fascism In U. S.

(Ed. Note: The following statement
was prepared by Norman Thomas, three
times presidential candidate of the So-
cialist Party.)

The central issue, we Socialists de-
voutly believe, is socialism versus
capitalism. There is a danger of war
and fascism in America, but under
American conditions we shall not
avert the danger but make it more
likely if we declare a moratorium on
our struggle for socialism and talk

about a temporary issue of democracy
versus reaction or democracy versus
a fascism represented supposedly by
Governor Landon and Republicans.

Doubtless there are shades of dif-
ference between the old parties.
These differences are not great
enough to deliver us from the danger
of war and the new economic col-
lapse which is likely to bring fascism
in its train. Hence our emphasis is
on socialism, ‘which is of particular
interest to youth if for no other rea-
son than because youth must live
longer on this earth.

We Socialists have striven all over
the civilized world to show that the
proﬁt system is breaking up of its
own weight ‘and that it must be re-
placed by socialism.

CandidateF or Union Party
Stresses Money Issue

 

(Ed. Note: The following statement
was submitted by William Lemke, can-
didate of the Union Party. In some
states, due to prior existence of a party
under that label, the party is known
as the Royal Oak Party. Mr. Lemke
is being supported by followers of
Father Coughlin, Dr. Townsend "and
remnants of the Huey Long machine,
under Gerald L. K. Smith.)

Issues, if not disposed of now and
disposed of rightly, will wreck and
destroy this democracy. I know that
the people desire to vote upon the
question of whether or not Congress
shall assume its constitutional power
to “coin money and regulate the
value thereof.”

Among other fundamental issues
is the necessity of assuring to all
laborers willing to work and capable
of doing so, an annual wage which
would enable them to live up to an
American standard of living. This
means a standard of living which
would allow every working man to
provide his children with a suit-able
education.

Our nation has reached the stage
in its existence where it must as-
sume its social obligations. We must
provide adequate and reasonable se-
curity for the aged who through no
fault of their own have been made
the victims of an unjust system.

Unemployment Is Big Issue

In Mind Of J. W. Aiken

_ (Ed. Note: The following statement
is that of John W. Aiken, candidate of
the Socialist-Labor Party. Mr. Aiken is
a cabinet-maker by trade, and he takes
time off merely for the campaign. He
is one of the most colorful, though
least-publicized candidates, combining
deep sincerity with sympathetic under-
standing of current issues and an abil-
ity to defend his ideals. Although his
party polls only about 35,000 votes, he
continues to carry his party emblem
forward.)

The paramount issue in this cam-
paign is that presented by the ex-
istence of an unemployed army of
about eleven million workers. Al-
though there is a profusion of plans
and theories for the solution of this
problem, only the Socialist-Labor
Party’s proposal attacks the funda-
mental cause of unemployment.

A realistic view of world economy
compels recognition of the fact that
capitalism has reached the apex of

itsdevelopment and no longer pre-

sents opportunities for extensive ex-
pansion. Unemployment on an in-
creasing scale has become a deﬁnite
and permanent feature of capitalist
society. If the abundance producible
is to be enjoyed, the capitalist—proﬁt
system must be destroyed. It cannot
be mended; it must be ended, and

production for use established in its ‘

place.

CE’s Assured Jobs, ,

McCandliss Declares;

Civil engineers need not worry
about their chances for a job when
they graduate, if the word of L. C.
McCandliss, professor of civil‘ engi-
neering, means anything.

“Employment of civil engineering
graduates is deﬁnitely on the up-
grade,” says Mr. McCandliss. “We
have placed 90 per cent of our 1936
class.”

“As long as people continue to re-
place old buildings, relvo-cate highways
to meet the needs of modern traﬁic,
tear down slums and antiquated of-
ﬁces, cl-ean up streams and provide
for adequate sewage disposal and
ﬂood control, there will he need for
good civil engineers,” Mr. McCand-
liss maintains. '

Steel company and railroad jobs
have claimed the majority of the 1936
CE graduates.

Ernest W. Brown and William G.
Hall are working in apprenticeship
positions for the American Rolling
Mills Corporation. Brown is work-
ing at Butler, and Hall is stationed
at Middletown, Ohio.

Other CE’s employed by steel com-
panies are F. S. Van Wert, who is

working in the design department of
the Jones and Laughlin Steel Com-
pany; and George B. Martin, who is
employed by the Carnegie-Illinois
Steel Company as an apprentice en-
gineer.

“Working on the Railroad” is an
appropriate song for Albert S. Barr
and William O. McCluskey. Barr is
working in the classiﬁed engineering
service of the Pennsylvania Railroad.
This branch is the apprenticeship
force from which all operating execu-
tives are picked. McCluskey is em-
ployed in a similar capacity by the
Wheeling and West Virginia Rail-
road.

Ralph E. Ketchum, CE36, works
in the design room of the National
Fireprooﬁng Company of Pittsburgh,
and John J. Fogarty, another CE, is
in the general contracting business
in Newburgh, N. Y.

Last August, Charles H. Beam,
CE31, boarded a ship bound for Ku-
wait, Arabia, to take charge of oil
prospecting work on a gasoline con-
cession there. Before leaving on his
present assignment, he worked as an
interpreter of gravity surveys.’

PlIPiE...and of ﬁner
texture than most anything
that touches your lips...

We all agree on this . . . cigarette
paper is, important. For Chesterﬁeld
we’ use the best paper that we can
buy. «It A is called Champagne Ciga-
rette Paper. It is made from the soft,
silky ﬁbre of the ﬂax plant. It is

washed over and over in clear, spark-

ling‘ water.

A lot of the pleasure you get in
smoking Chesterﬁelds is due to our
using the right kind of cigarette pa-
per. Chesterﬁeld paper is pure, and

it burns without taste or odor.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
   
 

Remember this . . . two things make the
smoking quality of a cigarette—— the tobaccos and the
paper. The Champagne cigarette paper on Chester-
ﬁelds is tested over and over for purity, for the right
burning quality. Another reason why Chesterﬁeld wins.
