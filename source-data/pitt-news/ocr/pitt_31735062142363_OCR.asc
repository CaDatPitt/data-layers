 02nd Lt. McKay
   Tells of Life
’ ln WAAC:

Pitt’s ﬁrst member of the WAAC,
newly-commissioned Second Lieu-
tenant Marion McKay, was back in
town last week, on a brief leave be-

A‘ ‘fore reporting to a new post. One
of the ﬁrst women to be accepted

when the call was sent out for
officer candidates for the women’s
army, Lieutenant McKay is enthus-
iastic about WAAC life. In fact,
she has been addressing various

‘University classes on the merits of

like WAAC.

Although she is quick to term
the entire WAAC program “won-
derful,” Lieutenant McKay ad-
mits that certain things such as
the 5:30 o’clock rising hour are
considerably less than intriguing.
“The girls have to be dressed and
ready for a 6 o’clock inspection,”
which is just ﬁfteen minutes later
than the regular soldiers’ inspec-
tion,” Miss McKay supplied.
“They found that it takes women

‘ ‘in little longer to get ready.”

- However, all lights are out by

j  :30 o’clock with the motto appar-

_‘ently being “Early to bed, early to
rise, etc.” This curfew does have
is drawbacks. Lieutenant McKay
relates the story of one WAAC who
had a very heavy cold. The lights
had been out for some time when
die decided to rub herself with
some ‘Vicks.’ She groped around in
her foot locker, ﬁnally locating the
bottle. She applied it freely to her
ﬂiroat, and chest, placed some up
her nostrils and even swallowed
some. Even though the weather was
warm the ‘Vicks’ seemed unusually

, sunny and, furthermore, it sudden-

ly dawned on her that it didn’t even
smell like ‘Vicks.’ She secured per-
mission to have the lights turned
on and there she lay, with ink drip-
Eflg all over her, the bed, and the
or.

You’ll like “Abe Lincoln in Illi-
pbis. ” You’re bound to like it. See
E tonight if you don’t believe me.

You’ll like the actual play. Rob-
mt Sherwood, one of America’s
leading dramatists, has written a
« y alive with all the hopes and
. oughts of us Americans engaged
in a battle for what we know to
be right.

You’ll like the acting job done
by the Pitt Players. Harold Gon-
delman, as Abe Lincoln, tackles
the Raymond Massey role, and
lloes an excellent piece of acting.
Somehow, even his appearance
seems like that of our great Presi-
dent. And Gondelman has man-
aged to capture that studied, sin-
pere talk which we have associated
with Lincoln.

Set By PEKA
With 41 Men

Men’s fraternities set the second
highest rushing record in recent
University history when 195 stu-
dents pledged this fall. This mark
falls only 9 short of the all-time
record set in 1936 when fraterni-

ties pledged 204.

Pi Kappa Alpha set an all time
record for an individual fraternity
by pledging 41 men. According to
Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men,
27 was the greatest number ever
pledged at one time by a fraternity
previous to this.

Pi Lambda Phi, Phi Gamma Del-
ta, and Delta Tau Delta were tied
for second with 22 each.

Following is a list of the fra-

ternities and their pledges:

Lead Sophop
At Wm. Penn

Robert Verkin, and June Thomp-
son will lead the Soph Hop tonight
in the Hotel William Penn's Urban
room. ’

‘Clyde Knight and his 13-piece
organization will provide the music
for the affair. Miss Jean Demor,
lovely vocalist, and guitarist Herb
Rohr will be featured. Requests
from the students will be played by
the orchestra throughout the entire
dance.

The ground ﬂoor ticket booth
will be in operation all day today
but tickets may also be purchased
by those who wish to, from yellow-
ribboned committee members.

Hugh Chavern, and Tee Nash, of L _

the publicity and decorations com-
mittees respectively, announced
that the decorations will be on the
Halloween theme. ‘

Tickets, which are $2.00, tax in-
cluded, may be bought up until the
time of the dance from any "commit-
tee member or at the door. The
dance will last from 9 to 1 o’clock.

two and one-half hour play to one
and one-half hours and still keeping

most of the power and beauty of
the play. Whitehill, too, has by his
direction, given the presentation
the honest, homey quality that a
play about an honest, homey man
should have.

“Abe Lincoln” though, isn’t
merely a grim account of a small
Illinois town postmaster who rises
to the presidency. Sherwood had too
much respect for the story-telling
and the good nature of Lincoln to
try such a story. Throughout, the
play has lively dialogue, as when
Abe ﬁrst tells friends about Mary
Todd, played in spirited fashion by
Margaret Holland. “ . . . ” and she
spells her name with two d’s. One
was good enough for God.” James
Dunn, in his portrayal of Billy Her-
don, a law clerk who continually
urges Lincoln to take up the Abo-
litionist cause and then proceeds
to get drunk, adds further humor

Thirty thousand pennies have

collected before the opening of the collection booth opposite the book

University’: Organist
Gives Chapel Recital

Frederic Lotz, University organ-
ist, will offer the following selec-
tions in his recital at Heinz Chapel
at 1 :00 o’clock today:

Overture to Marriage of Fig-
aro, by Mozart; On Wings of
Song, by Mendelssohn; From the

Southland, by H. B. Gaul; Shep-
herd’s Dance Henry VIII, by Ger-
man; and Toccata and Fugue in
D minor, by Bach. ' «

by his enthusiastic acting. And
Richard Briney is delightful as the

self-confessed politician, Crimmin.

But Sherwood does show that
Lincoln changed from a man will-
ing to permit slavery for the sake
of preserving peace to a deter-
mined ﬁghter for the right of all
peoples to live a decent life. In
the scene depicting‘ a Lincoln-
Douglas debate, Gondeman holds
his audience’s attention for ten
minutes as he gives Lincoln’s
stand on slavery. In that scene,
another hit of ﬁne acting is done
by clear-voiced Ivan Birsic, who
portrays Stephen Douglas.

Others outstanding in their roles
are Robert Fitzpatrick, who gives
a soft-spoken realness to Joshua
Speed; Phyllis Cohen, as Elizabeth
Edwards; and Alice Conick, who as
Ann Rutledge, is appealing in her
brief appearance.

The ﬁnal performance will be
given tonight at 8 o’clock. Admis-
sion is by student activities ticket.

/
A

store Wednesday.

Students are urged to bring their
old pennies into the booth, which is
open Monday, Wednesday, and Fri-
day from 8:30 to 1:30 o’clock, and
exchange them for cash.

-Purpose of the drive is to return
to circulation old pennies which
have been stored away in penny
banks and coin collections. This will
cut down the amount of copper
which is now an essential war ma-
terial that must be used for mint-
ing new pennies.

The campaign is being conducted
by a committee of Business Admin-
istration freshman under the su-
pervision of Dr. J. Ellwood Amos,

_ associate professor of ﬁnance. It is

hoped by Dr. Amos and the com-
mittee that other schools in the uni-
versity will help in the campaign.

The Associated Press, national
newspaper syndicate, will soon re-
lease the story of the campaign
through its New York Newspapers.
The campaign is soon to be conduct-
ed on a national basis by the mint.

"Abe Lincoln" Will Use

Original Gamble Flag

Part of the background for the
Lincoln-Douglas debate scene in
“Abe Lincoln in Illinois” is fur-
nished by a ﬂag which was made in
France and brought to America in
1856.

This flag was used during the
original Lincoln-Douglas debate by
Stephen Gamble of Monmouth, Illi-
nois, who was a great admirer and
follower of Douglas. Originally the
ﬂag had 34 stars, others being add-
ed as new states were admitted to
the Union.

Mrs. Charles W. Lomas, nee Miss
Eloise Gamble, granddaughter of
Stephen Gamble, is the present
owner of the flag. She is the wife
of Dr. Charles W. Lomas, instruct-
or in English at the University,

To War Fund

The time for double talk is over. 0

Now is the time to “Give Double."

Next week the campus campaign
of the United War Fund will aim
for a double contribution from each
student. Student and faculty speak-
ers will publicize the drive in third
hour classes on Wednesday and
Thursday. At that time each con-
tributor will receive a Pitt tag, auto
sticker, and two feathers.

Today Johanna Capetan, Ed-14, '

and her committee who are in
charge of preparing material for
the drive, are working in 1228 Ca-
thedral. Organized activity groups
are helping but more aides are
needed. “If you have a free hour to-
day, join the production 1inc,” sug-
gests Hal Gondelman, C43, chair-
man of the campaign.

Some University organizations
will receive a certain percentage of
the first $2,500 contributed to the

« campus drive. The organizations to

benefit are: YMCA, YWCA, Men’;
Loan Fund, Women’s Loan Fund,
and Pitt in China.

A faculty drive under the chair-
manship of J. G. Quick, University
registrar, will close at the same
time as thc student campaign.

All students are asked not to
have their mail sent to the Uni-
versity Post Office. The following
students will please call for mail
sent to the post office for them:

‘ A’ two hour period every week is

well over 220 and offers a wealth
of experience to young pre-meds.
The School of Nursing is also af-

potential nurses go about their va-

the staff is well rounded out by a

this situation has improved is evi-
denced by the. fact that in subse-
quent encounters, the air attack of
the Tartans was successful to a
marked degree. Against Westmin-
ster, an admittedly weak opponent,
the Skibo offense clicked against
the background of a strong line
which was able to hold their oppo-
nents to a total standstill.

In the Case encounter, Tech’s
defense was the main feature of
the game, but her offense did not
remain totally ineffective. This fact
along with last Saturday’s win
over the Buffalo Bisons gives the
Tartans much confidence in their
ability to hold the Blue and Gold at
least to a reasona-ble margin inthe
forthcoming battle this Saturday.

By far the most notable item in_

the Skibo lineup is the strong line.

“Carlson Calls

Caandidates

First call for freshman basket-
ball aspirants was issued this week
by Dr. H. C. Carlson, head coach.
All freshmen players and managers

’ interested are requested to report
A to Gate 3 of the Stadium on Monday
_ afternoon, Nov. 2.

Dr. Carlson pointed out that,

due to the inability of the athletic .

departmentto procure new equip-
.ment, all candidates might not re-
ceive equipment, and would have
. to bring their own shoes and suits
for the first. few weeks of practice.
All available equipment will be
issued on a first-come-ﬁrst-served
basis.

._ Lack of experience need not deter
_ anyone from reporting, for, as in

' former years, there will be no out-

-there will be no “ﬁrst” or “second”

relief from the visitors from Indi-
ana and Duke.

. Conﬁdence. is high ._ among the
strongly-favored Panthers for the
Skibos have been very soft touches
in the years since the collapse of the
Steifens fund. However, it would be
a mistake to discount the Techites

completely, for it is a general fact -

that the underdog from whom the
least is expected is the one_that
pulls the biggest upset. No-hitters

are usually spoiled by the fellows-

with the .096 average, not by the
.300 hitters. Furthermore, the
Techs are rebuilding and are on the
slow way to football recovery.

Strangely enough, the underdog
Tartans have the better end_ of the
statistics. They have recorded
decisive victories over Westmin-
ster, Grove City, and Buffalo, the
latter a 27-0 verdict last week,
while the best the Panthers have.
to show is a 27-0 shutout against
SMU.

However, Tech has been playing
what might be generously known
as minor league opposition, while
the Panthers have been taking on
the best college football has to
offer. The quality of Tech football
opposition may be gathered from
the fact that in the 27-0 victory
Tech recorded ove.r Buffalo on Sat-
urday, mainly second and third
string members of the team were
used.

In line with the recently an-
nounced decision of the Faculty
Committee on Athletics to permit
the use of freshmen against those
teams using freshmen, some of
the ﬁrst year members may be
used in the game. While it is doubt-
ful whether many of them will
even be in uniform, two that may
see action are left end, Walter
(fummins and a clever little quar-
terback, Rollin Catarinella. Cum-
mins is considered one of the finest
prospects Pitt has had in some
time.

It is hoped that Pitt’s long in-
jured list will have reduced itself
by Saturday's game to permit
some of the ﬁrst stringers to re-
turn to the lineup minus the as-
sortment of tapes and bandages
that featured last week’s contest.
Allshouse in particular was missed
last week as many of Pitt’s mis-
plays can be attributed to erratic
passing at center.

If Stetler, Gcstner, Allshouse,
all can return to the lineup, and Bill
Dutton can continue his hang up job
at left half, Tech will have good
reason to be wary of Saturday’s
encounter. The Pitts may not only
avenge the Duke and Indiana scores,
but that 50-7 Minnesota score as

         

the Bison rushing to a total of
minus ‘three yards in the ﬁrst half.
The total yards gained by the
Buffalo aggregation amounted to
27 yards as compared with the
Tartans 237.

The backﬁeld has .as its spark-
plugs hard-hitting “Clumpo” Byers
whose line charges have been felt
repeatedly in the ﬁnal tally; Mc-
Laughlin, ﬁne hurler for the Plaids;
Pash, tricky halfback, and Weise,
smart signal barker. Carnahan,
Tech’s wide ranging end, will do

,-much to aid in the success of the

Tartan aerial attack.

As usual the Tartans, will be on .

the short end of the odds in their
battle with the Panthers, but this
means little to them.
point to the predictions on the Buf-
falo game for foundation of their

conﬁdence. The general consensus '.
of the team indicates that apvictory '
will" not surprise them at all, and '

they fully expect to give the Pitt
Panthers. a game that will not be

r Faces His Pupil, A

vs. Baker I I

while it was feared that Baker
was too thin to stand up under
the gal!’ of paying big time foot-L
ball. During his freshman year
Baker played center. The follow-
ing season when he advancedrh

the varsity, he was too light for 

the line, too slow as a halfback
and so he became a signal-caller.

It was here that Baker went. on 

to become one of the smartest oﬁ d
generals to ever direct a Pitt team.
In 1930 Baker was captain of the
team and played his best football
for the Blue and Gold. He was

chosenas one "of the quarterback!) A

on the East team that annually
plays the cream of the Westeim
teams on New Year’s Day.

Following his graduation in
1931, Baker was added to the
Panther coaching squad. He kept
his post on the Pitt strategy
board until 1937 when he left with
Bill Kern and ,went across the
bridge to Carnegie Tech. At the
conclusion of the 1939 campaign-
Baker moved. up to the head
coaching spot vacated by Kern.

During the 1935 and 1936 seasons
Baker worked with Bowser, who re-
turned to Pitt that year as a mem-
ber of the coaching sguad.

While his record at Tech is far
from impressive it should be re-
membered that he inherited the
Tartans at a time of complete de-
emphasis there. With the ma-
terial that he has, however, Baker
has done a good job.

‘Thus, tomorrow it will be the
Pitt system from both sides of the
field. The pupil comes back to face
his teacher- again. A win ftr the
pupil always makes good reading,
but tomorrow the pupil will prob-
ably it have to be content with
thinking back to the days when
he directed Pitt teams to vic-
tories.

'Acting on a recommendation of
‘ﬂue chief air raid warden of zone
four, in which the University is lo-
cated, University authorities will

i install a ﬁre-watching station on the

top of the Cathedral of Learning,

according to Dr. John Geise, Uni-m

Versity air raid warden.

' A number of things have already
been done in preparation to putting
such a post into operation. A tele-
phone for the purpose of reporting

, tires to zone four headquarters has

been installed. Thomas Jarrett, Uni-
versity photographer, is taking
panoramic photographs of the four
quarters into which this area is
divided.

When the photographs are com-
pet-ed, they will be made into maps,
showing every street in this section,
and will be placed for the use of the
ﬁre-watchers on the Cathedral roof.

Dr. Benjamin H. Williams, pro-
ﬁessor of political science, has been

' made the head of the new ﬁre-

watching service. He will be assist-

' ed by Dr. A. L. Robinson, associate

professor of chemistry, and by
A. B. Martin, instructor in political
science.

Thirty volunteer students are
needed to be trained as members
of the ﬁre-watching station.
Their duties will be to report the
fall of all incendaries and the

IA Meets Today;
For First Time

Independent association will hold
its first meeting of the semester
today at 12:30 o’clock in 24 Ca-
thedral. All independents, men and
women not members of any frater-
nity or sorority, are invited to
come.

Primary business of the meeting
will be the election of officers to
replace last year's leaders: Hiram
Milton, president; Ed Tablac, vice-
president; Betty Toohil, secretary;
and Aldo Icardi, treasurer.

Plans will be made for the or-
ganization of the membership cam-
paign, to begin next Monday, No-
vember 2. Independents can become
members of the association with the
purchase of a 25-cent membership
card.

Also to be discussed is the asso-
ciation’s social program for the
coming year. Already tentative ar-
rangements have been made for a
party in the Cathedral gym some
time in November, and for a joint
dance with Tech on the date of the
IF Winter Carnival.

“Students are welcome." That is
what the sign outside of Room 801
reads, and indeed the three univer-
sity chaplains do welcome the Pitt
students.

Dr. William R. Farmer, Univer-
sity Chaplain, Father Leo A. Kraus,
Chaplain to Catholic students, and
Reverend John P. Stump, Chaplain
to Lutheran students, have regular
oﬂice hours during which students
are urged to come up and discuss
their religious problems and points
of view.

“We are here and at their ser-
vice,” commented Father Kraus,
“and if there are any problems that
they have—no matter what they
might be, we would be only too
anxious to help them.

“Of course,” continued Father
Kraus, “the ﬁrst problem is to help
students with problems of faith
that they might be able to keep and
foster that God-given gift. Nothing
will help them more than a strong
and luminous belief in Almighty
God, in Christ, the truthfulness of
his gospel message, and the blessed
promises of everlasting life.”

The schedule of oiﬁce hours is as
follows: Dr. Farmer-—Wednesday,
1:15-4:00 o’clock, and Thursday,
2:00-4:00 o’clock; Father Kraus-
