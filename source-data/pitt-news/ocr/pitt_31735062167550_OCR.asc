For the third straight week-end,
. the University has been the scene
"of racial violence and confronta-
tion. The Circle K-sponsored
_, dance in the Student Union Friday
‘ T night, was the scene of last weeks
Q incidents.

V Campus security refused to is-
‘sue information on the incidents,
4 A and said that any report at all
~ _ would have to come from Captain
; Charles Ray, head of the campus
 ‘police force. Captain Ray was un-
 able to be contacted over the
week-end.

'.__ 1 According to JoAnn Sinay, who
‘was serving as money-collector
for the dance, the Circle K de-
manded University ID’s at the en-
trance to the Student Union Ball-
room, and refused anyone who
could not produce one.

 

A “Two campus policemen, hired
for the night from Circle K funds,
- assisted us at the door,” she
said, “but situations sprang up
A which we were unable to handle.”

 

VIETNAM MORATORIUM
On Wednesday there will be
-a brainstorming and organiza-
tional meeting for people in-
terested in working on the Oct.
15 Vietnam Moratorium. Pec-
ple are needed from all areas
of the university to plan a day
of activities centering around
the war and militarism. The
meeting will be in Room 306,
starting at 4 p.m. For informa-
tion, contact Ted Harding, 687-

MICRO-LAB

The YMCA will sponsor a Mi-
” « cro-lab tomorrow at 7, p.m. in the
; ‘SU Ballroom. Lee Bolman and

T Jack Goldstein will moderate.
There is a 50¢ charge. The lab is
limited to 125 participants.

A micro-lab consists of a series
 of participative exercises design-
ed to help people explore various
'_g}.aspects of their relationships with
,. {one another. Some exercises deal
">=~ with how people get to know one
,}._.. another; others focus on the ways
1 in which a person’s interpersonal

     
    
   
    
   
   
   
  
 
 

him. .

The micro-lab is basicallyan in-
 troduction to “sensitivity” train-
ringimethods. Participants often
 find that the micro-lab gives them
?L,"a-chance, of only briefly, to get
,. beyond many of the interpersonal

V 3 games we play with each other in
/our? day-to-day lives, and to ex-
‘perience more direct and authen-
‘ tic relationships with other people.
 Most micro-lab participants find
 — _ the experiencehighly exciting and
.:involving. Although it is too brief
’ to create very much deep or dur-
able learning it gives you the
,-chance to find out if you might
profit from a more extensive

 Union Incidents

Mar Quiet Week-end AWS Presents Storaska

She said that each ID-holder
was -permitted one guest, but that
perons being stamped at the door
of the ballroom were leaving and
passing on their IDs to friends
waiting in the lobby.

“The situation grew out of hand
and much of our time and atten-
tion was directed towards non-
university ‘militants’ who insist-
ed upon entering the dance,” Miss
Sinay continued.

She also commented that the se-
curity guards were inadequate,
and that they left their posts at the
door of the Ballroom. —

Giving an account of an assault
involving herself and a male com-
panion she said, “I had askeda
friend of mine to accompany me
to the Circle K office, because I
had the money from the dance
with me. As we advanced through
the crowd,” she continued, “a
large male grabbed by escort’s
arm and demanded 150;.” She said
when her escort refused, he re-
ceived a punch to his jaw.

The dance was closed at appro-
ximately 10:30, according to Miss
Sinay, the Ballroom was cleared,
and city police with their K-9
corps took posts on thelporches
and around the immediate area of
the Student Union.

In response to the growing pos-
sibility of assaults on women in
the Oakland area, Associated
Women Students (AWS) will pre-
sent Frederic Storaska Wednes-
day in a series of free lectures
aimed at the self protection of
women.

The lectures will be held at 1 to
3 p.m. in the SU Ballroom, 6 p.m.
in Tower C Lobby, and 9 p.m. in
Holland Hall, 11th floor lounge.

Storaska began conducting re- 

search on assaults on women in
-1962 when he became familiar
with several assault cases while
doing research on juvenile delin-
quency in a major city. During
this time he was an undergrad-
uate student at North Carolina
State University, majoring in psy-

 

chology. He was also a self de-
fense instructor for many nation-
al, state and local law enforce-
ment personnel and holds a first
degree black belt in karate and
second degree brown belts in judo
and jujitsu.

He has been conducting re-
search on assaults on women for
six years and has lectured to over
100,000 women at 152 colleges- and
universities. His program has of-
ficially saved four girls’ lives and
is reported to have assisted 34
girls out of assaults.

Storaska will try to give an un-
derstanding of the assault inter-
action, including what types of
people assault and why and how
they assault. He will also explore
what types of environmental sit-
uations are usually contributory
to the assault interaction, and
what types of behavior from the

girl usually elicit the most detri-
mental and the most beneficial be-
havior from the assaulter.

He will point out that assaults
are an exception to the norm and
will attemptto put fear of them in
the proper perspective. “Prob-

- ably not one in 1,000 girls will ever

be in a serious assault,” he be-
lieves. “However, almost all girls
will be involved in some minor
annoyances; for example, receiv-
ing an obscene phone call, being
followed, or seeing an exhibition-
ist or a peeping tom, or sitting on
a bus or subway and having some-
one put his hand on the girl’s knee,
etc.”

The dating situation is a major
part of the program, since appro-
ximately 60 per cent of all high
school and college age girls who
are assaulted are assaulted by
their own dates. Even though he
calls these specific instances min-
or, Storaska believes that they
could prove potentially more seri-
ous unless girls have a cognizance

f of what to do and what not to do in

order to prevent their occurence.

Every possible situation where
a girl has been assaulted and how

, to prevent its occurence-even

how to select an apartment and the
precautions to take will be in-
cludedin the program. If for some
reason the assault does occur, he
explains how to prevent the girl
from being harmed in any way,
and if necessary, if in defense of
her life, some methods of how to
incapacitate her assailant.

- According to Claudia Matz,
president of AWS at Grove City
College, “The women (here) en-
joyed Mr. Storaska’s frankness
and his ability to deal with seri-
ous and sometimes alarming mat-
ters with a light touch. His pres-
entation was excellent. We feel
that the women of this college
may now be better prepared for
any intended assault on their be-'
ing or anything which may threat-
en their safety.” A

At the University of Oklahoma.
the Dean .of Women feels that
“this is one’ of the most provoca-
tive and worthwhile lectures that
we have been able to provide for

. out women students. I, personally,

was quite pleased with the presen-
tation, not only because of Stor-
aska’s dynamic personality, but
because of the emphasis placed on
the importance of poise and clear
"thinking in a crisis situation.

Doors’
“Fire”

Spreads

by STEVE LUBETSKY
Staff Writer

It was not a Met game at Shea
Stadium. Neither was it a political
rally. Nor was it a student dem-
onstration.

On the contrary, it was an en-
thuiastic bunch of young people
that jam-packed the Civic Arena
Saturday night to greet the Doors.
No where in the domed structure
could an empty seat be found, as
the Doors played before a sell-out
audience.

Jim Morrison was at his usual
best, as the Doors opened with
“Break on Through” and “Back
Door Man.” A 20 minute rendi-

_, tion of “When the Music’s Over”

had the Arena roaring with shouts
and cheers. Jim’s prologue to
“Soft Parade” set the house afire.

During the number, “Soul
Kitchen,” things ‘got a bit out of
hand. Suddenly, the entire audi-
ence advanced toward the stage,
creating utter cha_os.___A chain of
police assembled on stage asntheﬁ
Doors broke into “Light My Fire.”
Several ‘fans were clubbed trying
to climb up on stage, and many
were injured, as people were push-
ing one another. The show was
stopped, as everybody was forced
to return to his seat. The Doors

' then concluded with an encore of

“Soul Kitchen.” _
After the Doors had left the

stage, their manager thanked ev- _.

eryone for coming and promised,
“We will return soon.”

Past Contrasts With Present

by MICHAEL EDELSTEIN W
Staff Writer

(Editor's Note: This is the second
part in a series relating a student's
summer in Israel. The first section
appeared in the Sept. 19 issue of
The Pitt News.)

Not all the ruins in Israel are
so recent. Appropriately, the favp
orite hobby is archeology. The
land is full of monuments to a his-
tory-packed past. But there the
past and present are hopelessly
entangled. as on Ammunition Hill.

°Israe| llust Live’

From this site Titus launched his
attack on Jerusalem some 1,900
years ago. The same spot was a
strong Jordanian fort which could
easily fire on the residential sec-
tions on New Jerusalem. Now only
a monument to 36 Israel reserv-
ists who died taking the hill in
1967 stands above the empty
trenches.

I lived in Jerusalem for three
weeks, while attending classes at
Hebrew University. A city where

  Group   Widens Program

Of the newer organizations on
campus, Israel Must Live is one
of the most successful. Founded
only last February by Alan Smol-
over, \now doing graduate work at
the Hebrew University in Jeru-
salem, it is designed especially
for Jewish students wishing to ex-
press their feelings for Israel and
to learn about Israeli life.

The group consists of a mem-
bership of about _l00 which is
steadily increasing. Although cre-
ated specifically for Jews, Israel
Must Live also includes a num-
ber of African students.

The group last year was essen-
tially political. Attention was di-
verted to speakers, films, and lit-
erature dealing with Zionism. A
political action committee was es-
tablished for the purpose of de-
fending Zionism from anti-re-
marks.

V sky couldn’t decide between clarity and cloudiness. With nothing
‘more exciting presenting itself on a Saturday night, we stopped
 over at the House so that he could talk to someof his brothers.

. i "As soon as we walked in, the rumor hit that-Bill was down-
'1-stairs in the barroom. Bill had been in Vietnam for the last 13
months; no one had heard from him; some of his friends had been

Home to many around this ‘burg is a place
called Scotty’s. It’s not a big place, and you know
where it is so I don’t have to explain that.

It’s . . . well, it’s like mother, tolerant of your
whims and proud of your accomplishments. It has
class and deserves respecttwhen you walk through
its finger smudged glass portals.

It doesn’t cater to your mood, and, it’s more,
arrogant than dainty. Yet, —it’s always there when
you need it. If you go there once during the day,

' usually you go their twice or three times.

THE PEOPLE who eat there are real, their

_ stomachs are for real, and Scottys is really there

to help. It’s waitresses are transplants from New
‘York City. If you’re a stranget, they treat you

with some kindness, but if they see your, puss day- _

in-, day-out, you can forget that “Yes, sir, Yes,
.ma’m”bit. A

You know they care when that hamburger plate ‘

is tossed in front of you. That’s real love. Usually,
Red and White are there to serve you; they’re de-
lightful. There’s also a younger crew, but they’re
still breakin’ in. - ‘

Engineers Pressure For

Greater Law Enforcement

Editor. The Pitt News:

We are deeply concerned about
the recent student assaults at
Pitt. and even more concerned
about the way they are being han-
dled. We are writing this letter in
the hope that we will get some
answers to questions that are
bothering us and many other en-
gineering students.

Friday. Sept. 5. several white
students were assaulted by rov-
ing bands of black youths. Why
wasn’t action taken? A girl was
criminally assaulted by two un-
identified blacks. Whye wasn’t ac-

tion taken?gThe following Friday, V

For Clriserl Uu ion

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to express my sup-
portfor’ the condemnation of the
new “Locked -Door" policy in the

s Student‘Union expressed by Dave

Tiernan. Mike Fabricant and Sco_tt

‘Baum in their letter to the Pitt-

News on Sept. 17. This measure
will not solve the tensions we all
know exist between the Universi-

‘ ty and community.

First, why the 6:30 time limit?

Does that insure safety at 6:25?‘ -

Witness the Hunt Room incident
(PittNews, Sept. 17, page 2).

Second, many of us feel this

measure isgdirected to a large ex- V
tent against the Black com_mun- -

ity; The creased security ‘meas-
ures were instituted after two

_ clashes between blacks and whites‘

which makes it appear that per-

haps black-white conflicts are 1

more threatening than clashes be-
tween whites such as those rum-
ored to have occured on the cam-
pus this summer, ' ‘ 

I would like to see the Union
open to the communityat all times
with perhaps special‘ programs

(movies, lectures, dances) set up‘

precisely for those" groups that

 

   

Sept. 12. windows in the Towers
lobby were broken and the cur-
tains set on fire. Rooms were

beaten. Was action taken; _were
arrests made? If so. why not some
publicity? Let the entire student
body know that something is be-
ing done. If not. where are the city

or campus police? Who is tying
y their hands and wasting our mon-
F ey?

What has happened to law en-
forcement on campus? Only two
years ago city police arrested
large numbers of white students
for protesting their hot dorm
rooms and yet today" groups of
blacks are vandalizing campus
property and assaulting campus

P youths. -Have law enforcement

techniques changed since thenor
are the police awaiting some-
thing more serious, maybe wait-
ing for someone to be killed. Have
the police adopted a double stan-
dard, a set of laws for whites and
a set for blacks, or are they now
much more liberalto everyone.
If they are, it can at least be said
that they are equitable. If they are

not, it must be said that they are '

discriminating against the ‘non-
blacks. '

The school‘ year is yet young.
Homecoming, Winter Weekend.
Engineers Week, and Greek Week
are yet to come. How can students
fullyrparticipate in these activ-
ities on such angunsafe campus?

Tri-Point Critic-is

Editor. The Pitt News:

I refer to Mr. Cohen’s diatribe,
carried in the Sept. 15 issue of the
Pitt News. His letter is a para-
digm of intellectual bankruptcy.
He takes on many issues. but I
shall_confine myself to just three.
His main theme seems to be an al-
leged relation between capitalism
and racism. '

The claim that "the oppression
of the Black man in America has
roots in the inhumanity of the prof-
it incentive economy” is sheer
nonsense. Capitalism and racism
are in fact incompatible. Pure
capitalism — which we unfortun-
ately do not have — demands (a)
an economy with perfect mobility.

-and (b) the hiring ofthe best man .

to do the job (all other factors be-
ing irrelevant). Both of these re-
quirements are obviously incon-
sistent with racially-prejudiced
hiring practices. ‘That such prac;
tices exist is undeniable and re-

prehensible, but let“us place the

blame where it belongs: not on the

capitalist system,‘ but on certain '

people — the particular employ-
ers and unions who ‘are responsi-
ble, and who are thereby acting, in

opposition to. the principles) of ~

capitalism. r

Further, theimplication that so- ;

cialism — I assume that this is
what Mr. Cohen would like to see

as a result of “restructuring" — .

eradicates or even inhibits racism
is untenable‘ in .light of the evi-
dence to the contrary, ve.g.. the
treatment of Black Panther John-

. -son in ‘Cuba, and of the Jews —— are

you paying attention, Mr. Cohen?
—in Eastern.Europe and Russia.
(Racism has, of "course, existed
in other kinds of economies.) We

. may conclude from all this that if
one wishes to oppose racism, one

must advocate capitalism and re-
ject socialism.

_It seems that few Blaek lead-‘
ers“ realize this. Theionly radical
Black leader I knowof who does is
Mr. Karenga. Perhaps he is not-
violent enough for Mr. Cohen. ~

Secondly, the implication that

‘ our society has “institutionaliz-
'ed;” white supremacy, from which

Ruply For Cohvu ’s

we might infer that. it is signifi-
cantly similar _to that of," say,’
South Africa.‘ is nothing less than
an utter perversion of truth. No-
tice that Mr. Cohen conveniently
does not explicate “institution-
alize.’,‘ In one sense. he is right
tie. the KKK exists). butgthe
view that our society can, as a

a whole. be characterized as raéist y
‘ indicates a lack of bala_nce,border'- ~

ing on neurosis. That racism ex-
ists in our society is not because
it is institutionalized on any large

‘scale, but because of two brute

facts: (a) Human nature can at

P times be quite vicious; (b) the
Black man is a ‘minority in our so- _
ciety.~We can generalize from ‘

these and conclude that wherever
and“ whenever these facts are con-
joined. there is likely to be preju-
dice of some sort. This generali-
zation is, it seems to me. histor-

jically justified.

Finally. the notion that man-
hood is inextricablybound to vio-
lence-is a hangover from austra-'
logpithecine—' days. We can’ all
think of men who were men in the

truest sense of the word who were

either most reluctant to use‘ vio-
lence, or_ who were simply non-
violent. The view that Mr. Cohen.
expresses is symptomatic of the
infantile nihilism that infects the
radical fringe. _ « V '7

      The 5
  Long Season 

by ./Ierry Gruebelg

' Sports Editor :‘

opnooooooooooooooooooooo-a-uooboo
 r Mentionthe UCLA Bruins to Carl D_ePasqua,' and the
_new Panther head coach might just gs well pick up a pen
_"and paper, and join the growing number of sportswriters
7 who are sending Tommy Prothro and company to Pasa-
tdena quite a bit ahead of time. t
 » .- “This is the best-balanced and most explosive UCLA
 team that I’ve seen in the ten years that I’ve been around
 Pittsburgh football,” said DePasqua, after UCLA put his
. ’1fPanthers in the cage early Saturday night.

. DePasqua has’all the supporting evidence he needs on
the Los Angeles Coliseum "stat sheets. And, of course, he"
can save time with a two-word arguement, Dennis Dum-
mit.

But no matter what argument is used, the Panther
players are unconvinced. ‘ .,
:1 , “If ‘they can go to the Rose Bowl, so can we,” said
 .1 linebacker Dave McGrath under-estimating just a bit, or
 Over-estima ting the Blue and Gold, or both.

 I‘ “I really think they werebetter last year,” added

right defensive end Bob Ellis, recalling the 63-7 Bruin
trounce he and his cohorts suffered last fall, and the 3-7
over-all record UCLA compiled. “But, of course, we’re
- ‘muchbetterthis year.” ’ g »
" _ ‘-‘If they (UCLA) play a big team,” said the other
2 ‘starting defensive end Paul Naponick, ,“they’re gonna lose,
-. VUSC will kill them.” ‘

.. But whether or not the Ulcans make it to the New
' - Year's Day classic really doesn't matter. The cold fact is
simply that UCLA is not in the same league as the Panthers.
< ' UCLA Director of Athletics J.D. Morgan visited De-
’ ‘Pasqua in the locker room and patted the losing coach on
the shoulder. “You’ve got a long way to go,” he~said, con-
. soling DePasqua, “but 'you’ve made a start. You’re build-/,
" ing something.”

How long “a long way to go” is remains to be seen.
But with a schedule similar to recent years slated for the
next ten, chances are ten years is the minimum.

One thing is certain, 1969 is going to be another long‘
I . season for the footballers. With one big loss already under
their‘ belts, the Panthers are not relishing Saturday’s trip
to Norman, Okla., where there is plenty of wide-open ter-
ritory and enough room to start a private cemetery for 1
those who arm themselves with pigskins.

LOS ANGELES—UCLA head
coach Tommy Prothro had -a
tough time getting his team up
for Saturday night’s game against
the Panthers, but when it was all
over the Bruins had game number,
two in the bag, 42-8.

“I don’t’think we did anything
quite as well this week,” said Pro- _
thro, looking back to UCLA’s 37-0
romp over Oregon State last week,
“we were not quite as excited.”

The Bruins had good reason to
take the game lightly. The Pan-
thers are neither a Pacific-Eight
Conference team contending for
the Rose Bowl, nor a_ formidable’
football unit. But the gridders

 showed Prothro and company a
few things.»

Despite the lopsided score, the
Panthers had"the Coliseum inhab-
itant wondering what happened to
the Blue and Gold patsies of the
past three mediocre seasons.

“I think Pitt is a lot better foot-
ball team than the last few years,
far, far, far better than anytime
since I’ve been . at UCLA,” said
Prothro after his Bruins took step
two towards‘ Pasadena. “I didn’t

think the Panthers would move ,_

"It hurt when we lost him,” said
DePasqua. “We couldn’t go inside
so then we passed.”

—DePasqua couldn’t find an.ade-

   

quate replacement for Ferris, .1‘ 5”;
who will be out for at least three ”“
weeks. But the Panther ground at-

tack came back strong in the
fourth quarter when second-string
quarterback Frank Gustine' re-
peadly sent fullback Tony Esposi-

to into the enemy line. '

“Esposito really ran nice in the
second half,” said assistant coach
Serafino Fazio. “That’s the best
running I’ve seen in a long time.”

The McKees Rocks bulldog
gained 52 yards in the second half,
most of them coming in the last
seven minutes of play. Esposito

Booters Drop

Home Opener

(Continued from Page 6)

a hard, solid 25 yard boot over the
goalie’s shoulder and to his far
right. This tied the score at 1-1.

It appeared only a matter of
time until the booters would once
again smash the ball into the Bi-
son net. Chucho Valencia just
missed scoring again in the third
quarter. It was one on one, and
the goalie came out to challenge
him. The kick, however, was wide
to the right. In the fourth quarter,
Wing Bob Trexler came even clos-
er. His 20 foot boot struck the up-
right pool of the net and bounced

‘ out of bounds.

Nevertheless, just a feAw»Jsec-
onds and a fine kick negated the
booters determined effort’. Bison
Dave Rath knocked the winning
goal into the nets within the last
three minutes. Several booters
stood i-n front of the net and goalie
Kerry Krause, but the kick de-
flected off one of the defensemen
and past Krause despite Rath’s
slight shooting angle.

“It was a pretty shot, but he
shouldn’t , have been open,”
Krause remarked.

Richey Makes Unexpected Return.
To Harrier Action In Ohio Meet,
Leads Squad To Surprising Win

Monday, September 22, 1969—THE PITT NEWS—Page 7

by JERRY MYERS
“Jerry Richey has the heart of a true champion.” These
were the words of Coach Jim Banner after the Pitt cross—coun—
try team streaked by Ohio University and Kent State by a score

of 26, 29. 73, at Ohio U. on Saturday.

A Returning from a herniated muscle operation of late this summer,
Richey entered the meet with the intentions of only running a mile.
When he saw the team in trouble he legged out the balance of the course

and finished second. His time of
27:52 was beaten only Ohio
University’s leading long distance-
man, Bob Burdleson, who posted
a time of 27:17. Finishing third
was Smith of Ohio University.

“I was very well pleased with
the top three guys,” commented
Coach Banner. Running second
man was Greg Rogers and third
man was Dave Szabat. Banner
quite impressed with Szabat stat-
ing that he did “a tremendous job.
Running fourth man was Mark
Vornehagen and freshman'Dave
Cheseborough ran number five.

The close final score clearly in-
dicates how close the meet really
was. Coach Banner, more than
once indicated what a well-bal-
anced, well trained squad the Ohio
U. team is. “Ohio University is
much further along in their condi-
tioning than we are.” Now that the
season is underway Banner is con-
fident that the boys will pick up
the pace.

The course at Ohio U. was es-
pecially difficult for the harriers,
predominent in a tremendous
amount of hills and valleys. Ban-

ner was hesitant, during the pre-
meet training, to drill the runners
on a tough hilly course. The main
problem is that running a course
like that can cause a lot of injuries
if the runners aren’t properly con-
ditioned. Banner didn’t feel they
were ready as yet for that stren-
uous a grind.

“We still have a long way to go,
but we’ll be ready for Bowling
Green this week-end. They’re not
as tough as Ohio U.” Next week’s
meet will also feature Buffalo,
but the coach is confident that

Buffalo will have the same ef-r

feet on next week’s meet as Kent
State had on Saturdays. “Kent
State didn’t help us and they did-
n’t hurt us. It was mainly a two-
team meet.”

Kent State’s top barrier Ed
Norris didn’t run, to Banner’s dis-
may. With Norris running and
conceivably winning, he would
have beat Burdleson and given the
Pitt Squad a little breathing room.

Mike Nolan also ran in Satur-
day’s meet, but wasn’t instrumen-
tal in the team vicotry. This week
a full squad will go out against
Bowling Green in Schenley Park.
The men of Coach Banner are
shaping up and are striving to
surpass the success they had last
year when they finished with a 5-1
record._ Richey will “run as far
as his legs will take him,” and the
team itself will have another
week’s practice and one satisfy
ing victory under its belt.
