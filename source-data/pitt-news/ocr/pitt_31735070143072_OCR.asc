For The Pitt News

At least one anti-G-20 group plans
to protest on Pitt’s campus and
along Forbes Avenue during .today’s
G—20 Summit.

‘ Members of the Pittsburgh G—2o
Resistance Project, a collection of
groups aimed at ending oppression‘,
plan to protest at Pitt’s three Bio-
medical Science Towers and busi-
nesses along Forbes Avenue, includ-
ing Starbucks, McDonald’s and U.S.
military recruiting stations.

Noah Williams, a spokesman
for the Resistance Project, said
the group chose to protest at sites
that it thinks have a negative effect

on local communities and that rep— 

resent societal issues intrinsically

connected and perpetuated by poli-

cies that G-20 leaders endorse.

He said the Resistance Project .

will protest at Pitt’s Biomedical Sci-
ence Towers because it opposes the
animal testing that occurs there.

Robert Hill, Pitt’s vice chancellor
of Public Affairs, said yesterday that
he hadn’t heard about the Project’s
plans to protest at Pitt and he would
have to research the Biomedical Sci-
ence Towers more before comment-
ing on any animal testing that may
occur there. , ,

Williams said the group targeted
Starbucks for what it calls the com-
pany’s “anti—union practices.” Star-
bucks spokespeople did not return
requests for comment. ’
_ The group also is unhappy with
McDonald’s treatment of animals
and at multiple strip clubs for their
treatment of women.

Representatives from McDon- ‘

ald’s didn’t discuss the restaurant’s
treatment of animals, saying instead
that “McDonald’s has nothing to do
with the G-20.” 1

The Resistance Proj ect’s coordi-
nators don’t have permits to protest
at these sites, Williams said.

‘.‘We didn’t feel it was necessary
to beg people in powerforthe right
to protest,” he said.

Diane Richard, a spokeswoman

for the city police, said in an e-mail ‘

that protesters need to-follow of-

ﬁcers’ directions. V .

“As long as there is lawful ex-
ercising of the First Amendment,
there is no problem. When oﬂicers

give the order to disperse, it should

’ be done without hesitation,” she

said. ‘

The Resistance Project said it
wants those who have not yet had
an opportunity to voice their views
to do so. . ;

“Our goal is to establish a frarne—
work, open up a space for people to
express themselves how they see
ﬁt,” Williams said. _ .

Pittsburgh G—20 Resistance=Proj-
ect is headquartered in Greenﬁeld.

The group has conducted work-
shops on topics such as protest
tactics and the history of global jus-
tice movements. Williams said the
group has canvassed an estimated
4,000 homes and distributed at
least 15,000 pieces of literature in
a bid to inform Pittsburgh residents
about the G-20. _

Williams described the group’s
philosophy as “anti-authoritarian
objection to all forms of oppression
and repression.”

Anti—G-20 protesters to travel from Oakland to Downtown Summit locations

For The Pitt News

The Oakland portion of Fifth Av-
enue will be the starting point for
several protests Friday, includ-
ing one march that will take a
few thousand people and their
musical instruments and gi-
ant politically charged puppets
Downtown.

Members of the Thomas
Merton Center, a local anti-war
group, and the Pittsburgh G-20
Resistance Project will meet at
Fifth and Craft avenues at noon
tomorrow and walk to the City-
County Building Downtown to
protest the G-2'0.

. Jessica Benner, a Pitt gradu-
ate student and member of the
Thomas Merton Center’s Anti-
War Committee, said she thinks
the G-20’s intentions are destruc-

tive and exploitative. - _
“The G-20 is undemocratic,”

_Benner said. “The G-20 is un-_
chartered. They’ha__ve no trans— ‘

parency. They exist because they
want to exist.”_

    

the Ivor I  If

The G—2o leaders represent
two-thirds of the world’s pop-
ulation and 86 percent of its
trade.

Pete Shell, another member
of the Anti-War Committee, said
he thinks the G-20’s secretive
nature and lack of a published
agenda contradict this statement.
He said the center’s demonstra-
tion, called the People’s March to
the G-20, is a cry against global
injustice.

The Center identiﬁes itself as
a group of “people from diverse
philosophies and faiths who ﬁnd
common ground in the ‘nonvio-
lent struggle to bring about a
moretpeaceful and just world.”

Reflecting this philosophy,
Shell said he and the commit-
tee have worked to reduce the
chances of confrontations dur-
ing the People’s March. This task
challenged the committee with
a tangle of negotiations on all
sides.

To avoid any confrontation
with the police, Shell said the

‘Center has been training “peace
‘marshals” for the last month.

Shell said these marshallsr are

‘trained to “keep our marchers

calm and remind them that it’s
apeaceful protest.” ’ I _

I The march had been scheduled
to end at the edge of the Secret
Service’s restricted-access zone.

A march of many causes

This would put protesters a few blocks
away from the David Lawrence Convention
Center Downtown. g

Benner said the movement has a pleth-
ora of causes for which to march.

With 70 organizations endorsing the
march, according to a count on the event’s
website Wednesday morning, causes in-
clude peace, economic justice, gender
equality and health care.

Editorial

‘G-20 a vernacular

spectacular event

ith all the protests, po-
W lice, class rescheduling
and bus detours sur-

rounding this week’s events, it is
easy to forget that world leaders
will actually discuss important
issues at the G-20 Summit.

We think. '

Here are some discussion
topics onthe agenda, accord-
ing to Reuters: creating a new
framework to shrink surpluses
in export—rich countries, rebal-
ancing the global economy, re-
working and regulating the world
ﬁnancial order and nurturing
economic recovery.

The itinerary is a litany of
vague management talk with
the exception of an old reliable:
global warming. Climate change
has become a perennial empty
gesture offered to the Europe-
ans.

EU: “Let’s address global
warming.” I

United States: “Oh, uh, yeah.
Let’s seriously think about talk-
ing about that.”

China: “Nope.”

United States: “Phew.”

Otherwise, themes for de-
bate remain enigmatic to any-
one without an M.B.A., or anyone
who is not a manager in “Office
Space.”

As such, it is no wonder each
summit attracts a motley collec-
tion of demonstrators, ranging
from anarchists to animal lovers,
who have no opinion on the shift-

ing of voting power percentages
in the International Monetary
Fund. . '

Every protest‘group wants

to communicate its message to ,

world leaders, but groups often
get criticized because they aren’t
speaking about summit—related
issues.

Why would people allegedly é

put feces in bathroom soap dis-
pensers, and how does it relate
to the G-20?

There is nodirection, reason
or connection. However, the rage
that fuels such Project Mayhem

‘behavior could be a manifesta-

tion of feeling excluded.

This sentiment is only exac-
erbated by rhetoric coming from
G—20 officials — Financial Ser-
vices Authority Chairman Adair
Turner declared.

“It is essential that priority
use of high proﬁts should be to
rebuild the capital needed‘ to
support lending, allow official
measures to be removed, prepare
institutions to meet higher capi-
tal requirement and that bonus
and dividend policies should be
consistent with this priority,” ac-
cording to Reuters.

Ignorance will certainly per-
vade many protests. There will
be signs like the infamous, “Who
needs oil? I ride the bus.” But
there will also be sincere outcries
on an amalgam of issues that will
not receive official debate at the
summit.

letters to the editor  

Dear Pitt News,

There are so manyﬂaws with
the soda tax editorial —— it’s hard
to know where to begin. The edi-
tors feel that our ailing system can
use all the money it can get — but
can’t the same be said of the work-
ing families struggling to put food
on the table?

A tax on soda is a regressive tax

I and would hurt those least in a po-

sition to spend the extra money.
Contrary to the study cited by the
editors, it would not reduce the

amount of consumption. Those who ’

consume sodas would morelikely
just reallocatetheir spending.

Finally, the editors argue that.

this tax would be better reserved
for a state to decide rather than the

federal government . The thing is,

that has already happened, and

it isn’t working. There is a tax in

place in West Virginia and in Ar-
kansas_— and guess what? Both

Arkansas and West Virginia rank ‘ I

in the top 10 among obesity rates
in the nation. '

Faithfully submitted,

Zachary Bombatch

President, Pitt College Republi-

of Pittsburgh this week by chanting,
yelling and waving signs, a far quiet-
er demonstration will take place just
acrossthe river, ﬁve stories above Sev-
enth Avenue.

These quiet protestors, sittingina
smallartgallery, aren’t anarchists, col-
lege students nor political activists.

In fact, although some of them
are clowns and some of them are U.S.
presidents, they all are cartoons.

This collection ‘of editorial car-
toons, located in the Andy Warhol.
Museum, is called “Drawn to the Sum-
mit” and was compiled by political
cartoonist Rob Rogers and Chatham
professor Sylvia Rhor.

The cartoons hanging on the walls
of The Andy Warhol Museum com-
prise Rogers and Rhor’s G-20 exhibit
“Drawn to the Summit.” .

With a luncheon for G—20 leaders
planned to take place at the Warhol,
those cartoons may very well get a
whole lot closer-to President Barack
Obama and other world leaders than
any of the protestors will.

“We’re using humor to hit up the I

same issues the protestors are ad-
dressing,” said Rhor.

‘ With diplomats, the military, pro-
testers and a world of_intemational

issues ﬂooding the city, Rhor be- '

lieves Pittsburgh will welcome some

laughter. I .

But notallofthe cartoons areeasily
read by Pittsburghers because they
aren’t just clippings from The Post-
Gazette, The Tribune Review or other
U.S. newspapers.

“Drawn to the Summit” features
cartoons from all of the G-20 nations
from foreign papers, in their native
languages.

With translations below each
cartoon, the exhibit offers a unique
outlook on world politics from the
perspective of each nation involved

inthe Summit.

The curators covered the clean
white walls of the gallery with gray
sketches of clouds, globes and ﬂoat-
ing hands armed with pens that sur-
round the framed cartoons hanging
on thewall.

While visitors su‘oll through the
exhibit, they laugh and grin as they
stop and look at countless caricatures
of Obama, deﬂated globes and other
world leaders. .

Though the styles, languages, cul-
tures and origins of the cartoons are
all unique, they all address common

~ themes.

The images tackle tough issues
like global warming with pictures of
cracked globes, the smoking indus-
try and American-made cars. Bank
failures and the ﬁnancial crisis are
also depicted, displaying bankers
throwing themselves off buildings
and sinking boats that represent the
global economy. _

“We wanted to ﬁnd common
themes with these issues —especially
from their national points of view, ”
Rhor said. “We wanted to make sure
we had representation from all of the
G—20 countries.” ‘

Drawn to the Summit displays a collection of editorial cartoons from all of the G—20 nations.

But over the course of the project,
Rhor gained a new perspective of her
own. ‘ -

‘ was really aleaming experience
for me,” said Rhor, who corresponded
with cartoonists from around the globe
to bring the exhibit together.

Working with Rogers was also an
interesting experience for Rhor, whose
background ineditorial cartoons came
solely from studying.

“He’s a cartoonist and I wrote my
masters thesis on political cartoons, so
we both had really different perspec-
tives to offer,” she said.

_ The exhibit is co-presented by

Toonseum, an organization within
the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh
that celebrates the art of animation.

“We were founded two years ago
with the mission of increasing the
awareness of cartoon art,” ToonSeum
executive directorjoe Wos said.

According to Wos, the political
power of cartoons is no modern con-
cept. I

.“Cartoons have been proven
throughout history to be one of the
most effective ways to make a state-
ment,”Wos said. “Benjamin Franklin
drewasnake cut into three pieces with
the slogan join, orldie,’ which ended

up being one of the ﬁrst mascots for
America.” ’

Andwhile“Drawnto the Summit”
probablywon’t quite staitarevolution,
it is -making waves in the community.

“The public’s reaction has really
been remarkable. The reception has
been fantastic,” Wos said.

So while “Drawn to the Summit”
might not storm the streets and make
front—page news, it still has a message.
to get across. . ,

“Issues from the G—20 have to be
addressed from multiple points of
view — this is just one voice,” Rhor

said.

.For the Pitt News

The music sounds like Green Day and the
vocals sound like drunken karaoke, so the
perfecttagline for this album could be, “Garage

but not very well.” .

There are many ﬂaws on this album. For
example, it’s hard to distinguish one track from
another, as they all tend to sound alike. “Cast
Aside,” “Dirt Road” and “Relate” could have
easilybeen re-mixed to make one serni—likable
track to save space for better constructed
songs, like‘ the following “Remainder.” With
aching guitar riffs and surprisingly passion-
ate vocals — even with lyrics that don’t reach
much emotional depth —— this track is easily
one of the best on the album.

As the album progresses, it becomes more

' apparent that cutting tracks shouldhave seri-

ously been considered. After “Remainder,” the
album continues for a dreadfully urmecessary
12 more songs. A ~

Only two of those songs stand out from the
mesh of musically identical tracks: “Hey Girl,”
which manages to steer clear of the generic
pop-punk formulas poisoning the rest of the

' LP and the album’s closer “Last Call (Fare Thee

Well).” It’s slightly gummy and pulled apart,

which works very well. Or perhaps it doesn’t ‘

work at all and only stands out because it sig-
nals the end of this album. ’

Though there are deﬁnitely strides in the
right direction with this LP, Lowlander needs

In 1984, Joe Luxbacher was given the
position ofhead coach of the Pitt men’s
soccerteam, becomingonlythe second
head coach in the program’s history.
To date, the men’s soccer team has still
only seen two head coaches in its 54-
year history.

10 things

Evan Burgos
Staff Writer

We’re two weeks deep into the NFL
season and here are the 10 things to
keep an eye on:

10. Nineteams are2-0 headinginto
WeekThree: the Giants, Vildngs, Colts,
Ravens, Falcons,49ers, Broncos, Saints
andjets. The teams that actually have
a legit shot at winning it all are the Ra-
vens, Giants and Vikings.

a swagger that hasn’t faded from their
Super Bowl win in 2007. And if Ray

East championship run.

that includes six 10-plus victory cam-

paigns and eight Big East tournament _

appearances.

Before taking over as head coach,
Luxbacher set the standard for indi-
vidual scoringasaPantherplayer. From
1970-73, he establishedfour schoolre—
cords at Pitt, including most goals in a
game (seven), most points in a game
(15), most career goals (37) and most
careerpoints (84). ‘

After graduating from Pitt in 1974,
Luxbacherbeganhis professional soc-
cer career. He playedtwoseasons inthe
North American Soccer Leagueforthe

 

Philadelphia Atoms before joining a
team that toured Europe.

Even though Luxbacher was for-
ttmate enough to play soccer profes-
sionally, it was his illustrious career
as a player for Pitt that helped fuel his
aspiration to coach the sport.

While he admitsthatplayingsoccer
ishist1uepassion,therealmofcoarhing
has allowed Luxbacherto continuetobe
around the game he enjoys so much.

“I love the sport, I love to play, and
coaching is an extension of that,” Lux-
bacher said. “I love workingwith young
men, developingtheir skills and passion
for the game.”

Luxbacher believes that while he is

privileged to work with his players on _g

‘To me, soccer is‘ a btmch of guys
who share a common passion for the
sport,” Luxbachersaid. “Thatbuilds the
foundationforabigsoccer community
that stays connected.” _

The head coach /stands at the
center of the Pitt soccer community.
Luxbacher acknowledges his role as
the leader of that community and his
responsibilityto guide the soccerteam
into the future. _

“We’re trying to‘ get this program
moving forward,” Luxbacher said.
“We’vehadsomegoodyears inthepast,
butwe’retryingto sustain that.”

Arguably, the soccer team’s most
successﬁrl season was in 2000 when
PittwasrankedashighasNo.7inthe
nation. The Pantl1ershaven’tseena10-
win season since then, but Luxbacher

thinks the future is bright for the pro-

Pitt will introduce a new athletic
facility in 2010, which will provide a
state-of-the-art home for the soccer
team. Luxbacher believes the complex

» will provide a giant step for recruiting .

and the program overall ‘
“The new facility is going to be a
huge boost for us,” he said. “When re-

s cruitscomeinandseethenewcomplex,
itwill undoubtedlybeadecidingfactor .

. in their decision.”

He cites increasingly competitive
recruiting as one of the challenges he
faces on a daily basis.

“Recruitingiseven more imponant
today because there are just so many
goodplayers outthere,”Luxbacher said.
“Recruiting requires a lot of time and
dedication ifyouwantto stay competi-
tive in the Big East.”

After 26 years of coaching soccer,
Luxbacheracknow1edgesthathisposi-
tion isn’t what it usedto be.

. “Coaching has changed a lot,” Lux-
bacher said. “A large portion of the pro-
fession doesrr’t take place on the ﬁeld

_ Luxbacher is making sure he’s ad-

is the goal for his team.

  Notes

from the
ground

Kyle Craig
Staﬁ" Writer

Secondary Thoughts V

A game against Navy’s triple-
option can make people forget about
a secondary’s trouble defending the

. pass. Now, as Pitt prepares for North

Carolina State, the questions raised

about the secondary after the Buffalo '

game have resurfaced.
North Carolina State’s quarter-
back, Russell Wilson, has enough

—-skill to make any defensive backﬁeld

nervous. . .
Last week, Wilson, a redshirt
sophomore, set the NCAA Division I

record for pass attempts without an I

interception. He has not thrown an
interception since Sept, 13, 2008. At
the 12-game mark, hehas 329 throws
withoutasingle pick. 

Forhis 2008 performance, Wilson
was named to the All-Atlantic Coast

Conference ﬁrst—tearn, making him

the only ﬁ'eshman to ever receive the
honor. Three games into this season,
Wilson has completed 66.2 percent
ofahis passes and has tossed eight
touchdowns. _
PittcoachDaveWarmstedtisaware
ofWilson’s abilityto manageanoffense
and limit mistakes. '

“[Wilson] understands what i

wins and loses football games. He’ll
take what the defense gives him,”
Wannstedt said. “He makes good
decisions, and when the ball comes

out, it comes out fast. He’s got a very

quick release.”
