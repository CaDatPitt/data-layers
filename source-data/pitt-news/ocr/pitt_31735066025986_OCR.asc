Staff Writer

Eric Davin began his dissertation as
a graduate student in history at Pitt.
Twelve years later, he is still battling the
FBI for records that would help him
complete the paper.

Davin’s story began in 1986, when
he decided to do his dissertation on
union movements during the
Depression. '

The FBI would not give Davin the
information about the Workers’ Alliance
of America and its first president, David
Lasser, that he needed, so he ﬁled a law-
suit against it under the Freedom of
Information Act.

After losing his ﬁrst lawsuit against
the FBI in 1992, Davin appealed the case

 
 
 
    
     

to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals,
Pennsylvania’s federal appeals court. In
1995, the -3rd Circuit ordered the FBI to
release more than 7,400 of these docu-
ments. In addition, the courts wrote a 41-
page detailed guidebook as a supplement
to the Freedom of Information Act, giv-
ing rules to what the FBI can and cannot
withhold from the public.

“This was the most liberal decision
concerning FOIA, because it requires the

,FBI to cough up information,” said
Davin.

These rules stated that the FBI has
the right to withhold information only if
revealing it would be an invasion of pri-
vacy or a -breach of conﬁdentiality
promised to informants by the FBI.

- After the ruling, Davin received the
documents, but there was a major prob-

lem with them: The FBI had censored a
great deal of the information on the doc-
uments. Words, phrases, and even whole
pages were marked out with black mark-
er.

These marked—out sections, the FBI
told Davin, are called redactions, which
contain names of informants and wit-
nesses that it cannot divulge. The infor-
mation under these black marks is what

Davin is ﬁghting to see.

In order to overrule the court order
to keep the information classiﬁed, the
FBI must prove to the judge that reveal-
ing the information would either invade
privacy or breach conﬁdentiality.

This is where the FBI has a problem.

For The Pitt News

When most young Pittsburghers
were trying their best to imitate
Willie Stargell’s famous home run
swing, 10-year-old Daniel Chew
was riding 200 miles aboard a bat-
tered, Sears Free Spirit 10-speed.

When in his 20s, Chew scoffed
at the latest fad haircuts, and began
to cut his own hair. The Pitt gradu-
ate, with a degree in mathematics,
calculated that the money saved on
haircuts during a lifetime would one
day add up to the price of a car.

And while many 35-year-olds
are well into their careers, Chew
said he may not realize his career
goal for at least another 40 years.

Such is the self—described
“freaky” life of one of the world’s
greatest ultramarathon cyclists, who
is 429,000 miles into his journey of
bicycling one million miles.

On the million mile journey,
Chew matter-of-factly stated, “I
hope to hit it by the time I’m 70 or
80.”

It all started in 1972 in Lima,
Ohio, when his family took part in
the Midwest Double Century, a
200-rnile bike tour. The Chews, all
of whom are Pitt graduates, were
well represented on the streets of

Lima, with father, Hal; mother,
Sarah; daughter, Carol; and sons
Tom and Dan, each at the starting
line. While the Chews didn’t expect
their youngest child Dan to ﬁnish
the grueling event, they supported
his unbridled energy.

“I wasn’t sure that I could ﬁnish
the whole 200 miles, but not only
did I finish, I also beat the cut-off
time [24 hours] by 30 minutes,”
said Chew in his characteristically
loud voice.

Chew’s early success with
ultradistance cycling struck a chord
that has not dimmed after a quarter
century of riding. While there have
been times when Chew said he was
weary of his“‘marriage to the bike,”
he was quick to admit, “I’m not
quite ready for a divorce.”

Chew’s enthusiasm for the bike,
in fact, has intensiﬁed the last few
years as the result of his Race
Across AMerica exploits. The Race
Across AMerica or RAAM, accord-
ing to Chew, is the longest, non-
stop bicycle road race in the world,
and he just happens to be one of the
best at taming the unpredictable
beast of an event.

The 3,000-mile transcontinental
race, once described by Outside
Magazine as “The toughest race in

Supreme Court rejects

challenge to Megan's Law

Across the Nation

WASHINGTON — Backers of 'Megan’s
Law are celebrating a victory in the U.S.
Supreme Court.

The New Jersey measure requires
authorities to tell communities the where-
abouts of released sex offenders.

Yesterday, the Supreme Court reject-
ed a challenge from lawyers representing
sex offenders, who said it violated the
Fifth Amendment’s protection against
being punished twice for the same crime.

. New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman
pumped her right arm in triumph when
she heard the news. An excited Peter
Vemiero, New Jersey’s attorney general,
said the main challenge to the law is over.

The action does not directly affect
similar laws in 35 other states, but propo-
nents consider it a victory. ‘

But another challenge is in the‘

works.

‘Michael Buncher says community notiﬁ-

cation laws violate constitutionally pro-
tected personal privacy rights.

revealed that she’s free of hepatitis C —-
the virus that forced her to quit country
music.

Judd told the National Summit on ’

Hepatitis on Capitol Hill that her blood
tests have come back negative for eight
months in a row. She says if she" were
going to have a relapse, it would have
happened by now.

Judd says the breakthrough came last
May when she prayed for a sign that
things might get better —— and an “over-
whelming feeling” came over her that she
was cured.

LOS ANGELES — Of an or the storms

‘brought to California this season by El
.Nino, this one is the most potent.

The new rain yesterday threatened

more homes with mudslides, and it ﬂood-

ed roads and railroad tracks. Some beach-

es are expected to see 17-foot waves.

As of yesterday afternoon, over ﬁve

.‘ inches of rain had fallen in the Los
Angeles area, and the heaviest rain hadn’t
even moved in yet.

Five homes in the Hollywood hills
were evacuated yesterday because the
hillside is moving; And a wall of mud
forced 10 people from a Venturea apart-
ment building.

The Paciﬁc Coast Highway in
Malibu was full of rocks and mud, but
was still open.

The North didn’t escape the brtmt of
this storm. -

Around Clear Lake, 90 miles north
of San Francisco, residents are facing
more ﬂooding. The lake could reach
record levels. ‘

Mudslides temporarily closed part of
Highway 1 near Paciﬁca, and they’re
threatening 60 homes in Sonoma County.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court
has upheld television and radio advertis-
ing in Western states for state—licensed
casinos.

The court rejected a Clinton adminis-
tration appeal in the closely watched free-
speech case.

Justice Department lawyers argued
that a lower court ruling wrongly relied
on a 1995 Supreme Court commercial
free—speech decision.

The appeal acted on yesterday

painting of the Duke. That’s the biggest
price yet at the auction.

Yesterday morning’s session was the
seventh of a scheduled 18. So far, the
auction has raised $8.9 million. Sotheby’s

His hobby became an art show cItPresby

Anitra Van Lier
For The Pltt News

David Hollowell never received for-
mal training as an artist, but he sketches
images of historical African Americans in
detailed, lifelike drawings.

Hollowell’s exhibit was displayed for
one day on Friday in the cafeteria at

, Presbyterian Hospital. The exhibit was part ’

of the Student National ‘Medical

. Association’s celebration of Black History

Month.

As Georgia Duker, a researcher and
teacher at UPMC, strolled through the
exhibit, she was captivated by the historical

drawings of the subjects and their accom-.

panying biographies.

“You can get a feel of what these peo-
ple were really like. It seems like they can
actually open up their mouths and speak,”
said Duker.

J. Nadine Gracia, the vice president of
SNMA and coordinator for this year’s
Black History Month celebration, said the

/ . / / « , / / .

organization chose the hospital" to display
30 of Hollowell’s 150 charcoal and pencil
drawings because “many African
Americans work here and we were also try-
ing to get more people involved.”

Janice Tumer, the cafeteria manager,
thought it was a good idea for the exhibit to
be in the hospital.

‘This was an open door because this is
the ﬁrst time the medical students and I
have worked together,” she said.

Hollowell is the father of one of the
ﬁrst-year medical students, Heather
Hollowell. His drawings feature African
Americans who have made outstanding
contributions in their ﬁelds such as Martin
Luther King Jr., Sojourner Truth, Leroy
“Satchel” Paige and Maxine Waters.

Hollowell started drawing when his
wife, Dr. Dorothy Hollowell ——- who was
teaching an African American literature
class at Boston College — asked him to
draw a few sketches for her students to look
at. .

He continued todraw as a hobby, and

later to educate.

He said, “I don’t just do the artwork, I
do the research too.” A

Under each of Hollowell’s drawings,
he includes a biography. of the subject.
Hollowell said he does this to expose stu-
dents to African American heritage.

Gretna Wilkinson, a professor at the
County College of Monistown, N.J., writes
poems for each of the portraits of women.

Hollowell’s favorite drawing is of
Frederick Douglass. .

“He was determined, and being
Baptist minister, I liked his oratorical
style,” said Hollowell. ,

When Hollowell ﬁrst started drawing,

he said it took him about a week to ﬁnish a .

drawing, but now it takes about an hour.
Hollowell is currently a full—time sem-
inary student at Drew University and is also
a product manager at Lucent Technologies
in New Jersey. _
Hollowell decided to do his own series
of about 70 abstract Aﬁican designs after
learning in an African studies course that

Picasso used Aﬁican masks in his art. '
Next year Hollowell hopes to exhibit a
series of African American women. in pas-
tels, a project he is currently working on.
Hollowell is selling part of his collec-
tion to corporations in order to generate
money to start a foundation for young black
artists. He wants to start classes and set up
a-gallery for the artists so they can present
their art work. "
“Looking at the obstacles our people
have had to face and with the opportunities
out there now, anything can happen for our
young people,” said Hollowell.
He will also soon set up a Web site for
people who want to browse over his work.
Until the ‘end of the month,
Hollowell’s collection will be displayed on
the ﬁrst and second ﬂoors of the Falk

Library and on the fourth ﬂoor in Scaife

Hall. a .
Eugene Wellons, a cafeteria worker,
said, “This is long overdue, days like this

‘have come and gone in the past, but this is

the best I’ve ever seen it.”

ments, who were adults during the
Depression, are now dead.
“If a person is dead, they have no
privacy rights,” said Davin. “It is
impossible to slander them because
they are dea .” - J
For this reason, U.S. District Judge

Gary L. Lancaster told Davin and his .

attorney that he would be ruling against
the FBI in the invasion of privacy
issue.

This leaves the conﬁdentiality of
informers. But, -in order to prove that
the release of these documents would
breach conﬁdentiality of people who
were interviewed by the FBI, the FBI
would first have to prove that the infor-
mants were promised conﬁdentiality
and second that the information was

' gathered in the process of -a law-
enforcement investigation.
. “That’s very difﬁcult for them to
prove,” said Davin. ‘ ‘ -

Though some members of the
union were also members of the
Communist Party and Lasser was a
member of the Socialist Party, this was
not illegal.

The investigation that produced
the material that Davin wants did not
uncover a single act of violence or
threat and never resulted in an arrest ‘or
conviction. , '

, Because of these criteria, the
investigation seems to have been strict-.
‘ ly political.

ment compensation, which, until then,
did not exist.
“That was a pretty dangerous

. idea,” said'Lynch. - -

On Friday, Lancaster asked Davin
to go through a random set of the doc-
uments to see how many cases there
were in which the person was given
conﬁdentiality by the FBI and the

information was gathered for law

‘enforcement. In 75 percent of the
cases, the informant was not promised
conﬁdentiality, and only one case out
of 269 had evidence that _the informa-

Students make $800 while on ’VClCCll’lO|1'i

1 Gerald Bergen

For The Pitt News

Medical , experimentation on
University campuses has long been

a source of humorous speculations,

ranging from doctors in long white

_coats wielding equally long needles,

to students hooked up to elec-
troshock machines set on
“Dangerously High.”

But medical experimentation
can be  well .;. fun.

Joe, a Pitt pharmacy major who
declined to give his last name,
spoke in glowing terms about one of
his medical experiences.

“You got your own room, free
HBO, a buffet for breakfas.t, lunch
and dinner, and they had one room
where you could watch pay-per-
view movies when I went to the
hotel,” he said. “I brought weights, I

brought a jigsaw puzzle. I actually ,

gained weight while I was there.”

Joe, who tested the effects of
social interaction on colds for a
study conducted” by both Carnegie
Mellon University and the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, was more than satisfied with
the time hespent with 35 others in
isolation at the Holiday Inn in
Monroeville.

“It was fun, almost like .a vaca-
tion,” he said. “There were certain
times of the day where we had to get
our ears and nose tested, but it was
a blast. We partied, played cards,
drank; I met a lot of cool people,
and I made $800.”

“There weren’t any restrictions
on alcohol if you were over 21 — it
worked like if you were in prison,”
said Joe. “A friend outside would
get the stuff, one of the doctors
would take your money, come down
to the lobby, pay back the friend,
come up, and give you your
change.” ’

Dr. Michael DeVita, chairman of

S the UPMC’s Ethics Committee, said

that UPMC had no policies on alco-
hol consumption during this study,

“Since the experiment was
designed to see how people reacted
in a social situation, and that it was
not prohibited in the study’s guide-
lines, and legal and study require-
ments were met,” DeVita didn’t see
any real problem “per se.”

But that does not mean that
t-hose who run experiments are
going to serve alcohol or just throw
money at the participants.

Terrie Ferguson, a registered

nurse at Magee—Women’s Hospital
who is currently moderating a study

‘cycles,

funded in part by the National
Institute of Health, said that anyone
who joins a study for the fast buck
is mistaken.

“Many studies are very inten-
sive and take a lot of time,”
Ferguson said. “The study I am
working on currently is over a 10-
month period, which includes -two
overnight. hospital stays» where
blood samples are drawn and also
involves 16 counseling sessions
over the 10 months.” '

In addition to the above require-
ments, certain criteria had to be met.
Ferguson’s study, which specifically
involves a non-medicinal approach
to women’s irregular menstrual
looked specifically for
women between the ages of 18-35.

They also had to be in a certain
weight range, could not use any

medication or smoke,“ and itjwas a_,

plus if they were educated so they
could better explain their symptoms
and understand the role their bodies
played in their natural rhythms.
Ferguson said the last point was
the most important facet of the
study: that of knowledge. While she

said that the $900 the participants,

received in her study was “ade-
quate,” the experimentjhad in mind
“a specific woman who wanted to

find out the medical reasons and
consequences of her cycles.”

Kelly Schmitt, a sophomore
psychology major, echoed a similar
reason for her participation in an
experiment. She tested a “morning-
after” birth control pill and said that
the $50 dollars she got for her two-
day contribution to medical science
“wasn’t worth it by itself.”

But the peace of mind testing
the pill’s effects did. .

“I am concerned with women’s
issues,” she said. “So I am willing
to_take risks to benefit others.”

Also important to Schmitt was
that. the risks she would be taking
were relatively minor.

“At most, they said I might
experience some nausea,” she said,
“but if I didn’t feel right about it, I
could have backed out at any time.”

Ferguson noted that any experi-
ment done by Magee—Women’s
Hospital must be approved not only
by the hospital’s institutional
review board,- but also has to com-
ply with federal guidelines. Since
her study -was funded by the

National Institute of Health. Also, it ‘

had to get the _ University of
Pittsburgh’s Campus Health
‘Services approval before ﬂiers were
posted across campus. .

Guarded optimism

Everybody would be well advised right now to

remain patient and not to jump to any conclusions

about the agreement made Sunday between the United
Nations and Iraq. A

U.N. Secretary General Koﬁ Annan travelled to
Iraq in the 11th hour last week in an attempt to forge an
agreement with Saddam Hussein that would allow
U.N. weapons inspectors back in Iraq.

Sunday evening, Annan announced that he did

come to an agreement with Hussein, but neither he nor I

the Iraqi ambassador who joined him in a televised
press conference would disclose any details of the
agreement. ,_

Recall thatthe current crisis began to swell a few
months ago when Hussein announced he would not
allow U.N. weapons inspectors in his country if they
were led by Americans. Hussein has spent a long time
— seven years, to be exact —— cursing the United
States and blaming us for.everything he did.

It is unclear whether this agreement will. allow
U.S. weapons inspectors on the U.N. teams, but if it
doesn’t, you can bet the United States won’t back
down. .  I ’

And we shouldn’t. Americans know a lot about
war and weapons, and U.S. inspectors are likely the
best in the world. If you want to be sure Hussein isn’t
hiding any chemical or biological weapons —— the kind

a terrorist could sneak into a book bag and drop in a I

Washington elementary school, just to make a state-
ment — then you want U.S. inspectors on those teams.
But during the press conference, the Iraqi ambas-
sador said that Iraq’s argument had never been with the
United Nations, nor any country other than the United
States. Even Annan said he had ﬁxed the problem the
“United States” had started. Annan also said he had a
chance to speak frankly with Hussein andhad come to
understand the Iraqi dictator’s concerns. ' .

That sounds an awful lot like giving in to
' Hussein’s demands.

Whether or not that is what happened, guarded
optimism would be the appropriate response for now,
at least until more details are announced.

But if the agreement does tum out to be accept-
able, we might have just witnessed one of the most
amazing and successful games of Good Cop-Bad Cop
ever played: Vtrrth the threat of military force, the
United States put an incredible amount of pressure on
Iraq. and the United Nations, to ﬁnd a diplomatic solu-
tion to this crisis, and the United Nations responded by
giving Iraq a chance to protect itself by making a deal.

Let’s just hope it worked. ' ‘

We don't trust the med school’s leadership

and a central
player in the
design of the
current cur-
riculum — had presented the

medical school’s Interim Dean.

George Michalopoulos with an
anonymous memo from five
faculty members requesting a

special faculty meeting on a hot '

issue.

Michalopoulos demanded to
see a signed copy of the “confi-
dential” memo before granting
any request. With prior approval
of the five faculty members,
Adler acquiesced.
Michalopoulos then sent a
memo to each of those five fac-
ulty members saying he would
call‘a meeting, but not within

the five weeksspecified by the

policy. No fur-
ther details were
given. ‘ I
- The stat-
ed issue through much of these
discussions is the new
University Practice Plan, under
which the now-independent 18
clinical practices (for example,
neurology, orthopedics and
internal medicine) will be fold-
ed into one streamlined group
plan. In a time of economic
belt—tightening, most believe
UPP is a necessity. But because
the UPP discussions have been
conducted under an unusual
amount of secrecy, faculty and
students have been _wondering
who was going to run UPP: the
University or University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center

THE PITT NEWS

Health Systems? And under the
UPP, will faculty be pressured
to cut its teaching time in order
to.see more patients and pro-
duce more revenue? .

After last T hursday’s facul-
ty meeting — the one requested
by the faculty Fab ‘Five and
eventually granted by the
administration — it is now clear
that the UPP will likely fall
under UPMCHS (with numer-
ous University members on the
UPP Board). But faculty and
students are still asking them-
selves: In a world where the
dollar seems‘ to/be king, who
will protect our education? The
administration guarantees it
will, but firing Dean Adler and

sending out sign-or-sayanora

UPP -letters of intent to non-
tenured faculty speak otherwise.

Don’t get me wrong, last
Thursday’s faculty meeting was

fa step in the right direction:

bringing together several mem-
bers of the administration, over
500 faculty members and 150
medical students. During the
meeting, many details of the
UPP organization were dis-

. closed. Knowledge has a way of
relaxing people. But problems,

quickly resurfaced.

When one prominent physi-
cian stood up and invited facul-
ty members to a second faculty

meeting this ‘Thursday at the

Graduate School of Public
Health later this week, Interim
Dean Michalopoulos con-
demned the proposal as a “par-
allel line of communication’-’
that would be a disservice to the
process.“ In a voice slightly bro-

Anti-Fraternal Council will elevate proletariat  

Adrian

Kimble

The tide is turning.

Oh yes comrades, the time of
the proletarian student is at hand,
and we will triumph. The advent of
the student class revolution cometh;
the Greek system will be dealt a
swift and deadly blow.

Our new fearless leader in this
quest is Matt DiMarco, leader of the
Anti-Fraternity Council and part of
the new breed of working class hero
who will help savage the last ves-
tiges of bourgeois America, and his
first target is Pitt’s discriminatory
fraternity andsorority system."

Fraternities and sororities are
rubbish. In their ivory towers, they
look down on us proletarian stu-
dents and make coarse remarks.
They drink martinis, have banquets,
and have sex with each other
because they enjoy thinking about
money and how erotic money is and
other such nonsense.

They collectively seek out
incoming bourgeois freshmen by
savaging them with Greek (no, not
my comrades on the Balkan penin-
sula) propaganda. “Greek power is
good!” I hear them cry. Greek
power is rubbish, more like.

Matt DiMarco, facing threats
from these corporate—drones-in-
training, has stood up to this men-
ace. DiMarco and his band of loyal
and determined Anti-Fraternity
Council members will do away with
this Greek nonsense. No more will
we have to face such tyranny from
the oppressors on University Drive.
It will be a long and hard revolu-

tion, but with DiMarco as our
leader, we will triumph. A
DiMarco, in his sheepskin jack-
et, reminds me very -much of the
fearless Fedka, the convict in
“Demons” ‘(the Volokonsky/Pevear
translation rules! So an “up yours!”
to those who call it “The Possessed”
or “Devils.”). A friend of mine
likened his photo in the Feb. 4 issue

of The Pitt News to that of a deer.

caught in headlights, but that is the
fault of bourgeois wally news editor
Harold Turner for taking acrap
photo. DiMarco is strong and deter-
mined, and will not take any non-
sense from the Greeks.

Since I’m proud of my Polish
roots (my father was a dockyard
worker in Gdansk,_ Poland), I
thought I’d start up my own Polish
fraternity (although we would allow
women, because we’re not sexist
bastards), named OCC, after my
three favorite vegetables (Onions,
carrots and red cabbage). ‘

I, as president of Onion Carrot
Cabbage, will seek to eradicate the
Pitt campus of this Greek menace,
and replace it with my Polish soli-
darity society. Instead of booze
binges and sex orgies (though we
will keep vodka appreciation

evenings at least twice a month), we

will have Max Engels mixers, and
host several meetings a month
debating the finer points" of commu-
nism, socialism and liberalism (the
latter with much disgust). We will
also organize several marches and
rallies, promoting the causes of the
trampled worker across Allegheny
County. We will not be elitist, but
proletarian in our outlook.

laccounts,

And Polish Week will not be as
dull as Greek Week, which is the
scourge of all non—Greek students.
OCC will not participate in boring
five—mile races for charity, but five-
mile marches for the advancement
of America’s working classes. If
we, the enlightened individuals who
attend the University do not stand
up for the oppressed, then no one
else will. ' v

Greek organizations churn out
corporate fodder left, right and

BENSIMHON

ken by emotion, another faculty
member asked the administration to
comment on the terrible morale
caused by the coercive UPP letter of
intent that was “uninformative and
discourteous.” Interim
Michalopoulos agreed that it was a
painful letter to draft, but he then
pogo-sticked back to the issue of

saving money. Fear wasn’t dis-_

cussed.

Having spent the better part of
the last two weeks thinking over
these issues, I have come to believe
that the powers that be just don’t get

it. So herewith are a few suggestions.

the administration might want to
consider:
1) The issue here, guys, is trust.
Almost everyone believes that
the UPP is necessary. Sure, the fac-
ulty and the students want to, know
the specifics about how you’re going

Dean .

FROM PAGE 6

to safeguard their teaching time _and

our education, but I don’t think we’d

be so demanding if we trusted you.
The air of secrecy surrounding

’ the UPP contract, the ﬁring (call it

what you will) of Dean Adler in the
line of duty, and the constant evasion
of the morale issue all serve to.fuel
apprehension, distrust and opposi-
tion. One selﬂess act, such as
appointing a faculty-selected com-
mittee (of non-department chairs) to
sit in on the final crafting of the UPP
agreement,'would go a long way.

2) Encourage discussion.

Providing medical services is
expensive; talk is cheap. Universities
were designed to be a haven for a
free exchange of ideas; labeling an
informational faculty meeting as an
undesirable “parallel line of commu-
nication” raises eyebrows.

What’s wrong with talking? Do

you have something to hide, or isn’t .

this supposed to be'a university any-
more? Should students really have to
whisper to each other to find out
what’s going on? Changing times
demand more communication. You’d
be welcome at the faculty meeting
on Thursday.

. 3) Answer the right question. My
eighth grade history teacher once
asked me to recite the Eighth
Amendment. Having not studied that
much, I spouted off the Fifth --
word for word. He was impressed,
but I still failedfor answering the
wrong question.- Sure we want to
hear details about the relationships
between the University, UPP and
UPMCHS, but not when we are ask-
ing you about morale.

4) Quit asking where we’ve,

been. For three anda half years, I
haven’t said or written a word about
curriculum issues. Why? Because
people I trusted _— like Dean Adler
—- were. already going to bat for me.

Use the Iraqiicrisis as an analo- A
gy. I’m sure we’re both concerned _

about our cou_ntry.’s safety, but I’m
not quitting medical school and I
don’t think you’re quitting your jobs
to go off and fight the war. Why?
Because we trust in the fact that our

/- Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines

have our best interests in mind and
are competent in doing their jobs, so
we go about doing ours.

That said, don’t mistake my
silence — or that of other students

and many faculty — for disinterest.‘

You should expect concerned faculty
and students to man the University’s
trenches as some of our trusted edu-
cational representatives are disap-
pearing. You should be proud that we
care so much about the place that

‘makes your jobs ‘possible.

NB trade bait?
Not anymore

The past week’s events once again
proved to me that the NBA is nothing
but a bunch of suckers.

Three “stars” and one bench
warmer all refused trades to prospective
teams during the ﬁnal days before the
league’s trading deadline.

Kenny Anderson refused to go to
the Toronto Raptors and was rewarded
with a trade to the Boston Celtics. Rony
Seikaly refused to go to the Utah Jazz
then was rewarded with a trade to the
New Jersey Nets. Doug West followed
their lead and refused to report to the
Vancouver Grizzlies before eventually
coming to his senses.

The inmates are obviously running
the asylum in the NBA. The players,
whose contracts are becoming more and
more ridiculous (see Kevin Garnett’s
$126 million gem), now think they can
bully owners through insubordination.

Maybe instead of expecting players

to report, the owners should ﬁrst ask '

players if they would be willing to play
for their organizations. Maybe they
should say something sweet such as “If
it’s not too much trouble, Mr. Anderson
or Mr. Seikaly, would you possibly
mind playing for our franchise? Pretty
please? We’ll pay you $10 million a
year!”

The players’ newfound ability to
stop trades on a whim (“Toronto’s too
damn cold in the winter!”) is causing the
world’s highest paid athletes to take
another shot in the chin.

The NBA hasn’t had exactly the
smoothest season ever. First, the league
learned that the best athlete in the world,
Michael Jordan, has decided to retire
following the season. Then, there was
the small black eye (no pun intended)
that the league received following
Latrell Sprewel1’s attempt to choke his
coach during practice.

V Following the Sprewell coach-
choking debacle, you would think the
NBA Players’ Association would deploy
a fervent public—re1ations campaign try-
ing to win back the fans’ respect. But the
latest round of bad press, this time over
trade refusals, threatens to create chaos
in the league.

New trade-and-report guidelines
must be established, or else the players
will be able to follow Anderson’s and
Seikaly’s lead and simply void any trade
that they don’t agree with. Currently, the
rule states that if players fail to report in
the 48-hour window after a trade, they
can be suspended without pay.

Weekend split may cost Pitt EWL title

Brian Knavish
Staff Writer

Five years ago, a starry-
eyed freshman grappler named
John Withrow came to Pitt
equipped with a boatload of
talent and handful of lofty
goals for himself and his
wrestling teammates.

Now here we are ﬁve
years later. VV1throw’s time at
Pitt is almost over, and most of
those goals have been realized.
He has developed into one of
the nation’s top wrestlers, hav-
ing reached elusive All-
American status twice and
becoming just the ﬁfth Pitt
"wrestler to win 100 matches.

The team has seen similar
success during the Wltl1f0W
era, ﬁnishing in the top 30 in

Injury, bad luck, and debatable offici-
ating conspired against the Pitt men’s and
women7s track teams at the Big East Track
and Field Championship meet at Syracuse
last weekend

The Pitt women ﬁnished ﬁfth at the

J meet with 57.33 points, just one-third of a
point ahead of St. John’s. Pitt’s men came»

in 10th with 31 points. Georgetown took
both the men’s and women’s titles.

Pitt’s women competed without their
star performer, Trecia Smith, who was dis-
qualiﬁed ﬁom the meet.

On the ﬁrst day of the two-day com-
petition, Smith felt a twitch in her ham-
suing after a long jump attempt in the pre-
lirninary round. She uied to keep going,
but her leg wasn’t getting any better. On
the second day, Smith attempted the high
jump anyway to score points for the team.

A high-jump referee disqualiﬁed
Smith for violating a rule that athletes must
make a “competitive eﬂ°ort,” ruling that
Smith did not do so because of the injury.

Marks that Smith posted in the ﬁrst

day of competition were allowed to stand,
but she was not allowed to compete in any
more events on the second day — includ-
ing the uiple jump, one of her best events.

“Not having her in

Injuries, tough Kent sqacl toomuch for Pitt gymnasts

Christine Coates

Staff Writer

The Pitt gymnastics team had its
third—highest point total of the season this
past weekend in their away meet at Kent
State.

However, the gymnasts did not walk
away with their seventh win.

“We probably had our best meet ever
in their gym,” said Head Coach Debbie
Yohman, but it wasn’t enough to down the
Golden Flash —— Pitt lost a 192.675 to
190.050 decision to Kent and failed to
capture a team victory in any of the four
events. '

conference title, but the Panthers looked
solid in the win.

“They [Edinboro] wrestled a pretty
defensive style, and that showed up early
today,” Assistant Coach Ed Palmer said.

Pitt accumulated its 18 points by
claiming six minor-decision wins, one each

by Rob Loper (126), Chad Jesko (134),

Mike Ziska (142), Jake Schaus (158), Nick
Mengerink (167), and Witl1row’s 7-3 win
over sixth-ranked Jim Stratight at 177.

Loper’s was a 3-1 overtime thriller.

“It was a little closer than I would have
liked,” Loper said. “But it’s just another of
those EWL matches where we’ve wrestled
each other twice before and we know each
otl1er’s styles.” "

Edinboro picked up minor decision
wins at 118, 150 and heavyweight, but the

said Pitt’s Pamela Lieberman. “It just
came down to scores and we were lower.”
The team did however have some
strong individual performances and some
career—high scoring. Calli Bodnar contin-
ued with her strong perforrnances on the
ﬂoor exercise, earning a tie for second
place. ‘ '
Lisa Fronhofer tied for ﬁrst with
Sarah Wolford of Kent State with a score
of 9.7 on the vault. Fronhofer’s vault score
was also a career high for her here at Pitt.
“I did well on the vault, but I didn’t
do as well in my other two events [bal-
ance beam and ﬂoor] .” said Fronhofer.
One of the more solid team members

for the day was freshman Colleen Crisi.
She had standout performances on
uneven bars, beam and ﬂoor, and tied
with teammate Lieberman for the squad’s
third—highest score on the beam this sea-
son — a 9.825.

The team’s disappointing loss may be
due in part to the team’s injuries. The
Panthers had to do with out Danielle
“Freddie” Alba who did not travel with
the them. She had been diagnosed with
mononucleosis earlier in the season, but
had still been well enough to compete in
earlier events. . .

For the Kent event, Yohman said, the
team was justtaking precautions by not

sending her since she has not been feeling
well.

Other ailing team members included
Erica Flamer, who only participated on

vault this weekend due to a neck injury,

and Becky Doll and Fronhofer, who are
nursing stress fractures. '

“We are looking forward to spring
break — midterms are tiring everyone
out,” said Fronhofer. “We will only have
to worry about gyrrmastics during break
and trying to get everyone healthy.”

The gyrrmasts host Ohio State this
weekend in the Fitzgerald Field House at
8 p.m. on- Friday. They will try to improve
their overall record to 7-4 and prepare for

Pitt rounded out its regular season by .
traveling to Lehigh on Sunday, but unfortu-
nately for the Panthers, the 18th-ranked
Engineers came away with the win.

Lehigh jumped out to an early lead .
with Mike Sferra’s 3-0 win at 118, but Pitt
battled right back with a 19-2 technical fall
by Loper (126) and a 8-6 win by Jesko
( 134). T

Three straight Lehigh minor-decision
wins at 142, 150, and 158 bounced the
Engineers back on top 12-8.

Mengerink continued to impress in his
breakthrough season with a 6-4 win at 167
to cut the lead to one.

But third-ranked John Van Doren
edged out fourth-ranked Withrow at 177 to —
pad the Lehigh lead.

Bodo cut the lead to one with his 7-3
win at 190. Then, with the meet in the bal-
ance, Lehigh’s fourth-ranked monster
heavyweight Bill Closon nailed a pin to
leave the ﬁnal score at 21-14.

Panther hockey ends season
with two losses in NJ. tourney

Rachel Lenzi
Staff Writer

LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. — No matter
how much they shot or how many hits they
threw, the Panthers’ hockey team couldn’t
ﬁnish the season on a winning note against
Rider University or Daniel Webster
College at the Rider Tournament this past
weekend

But after Sunday’s loss to Daniel
Webster, the win factor wasn’t a concern
for Head Coach Wade Chouinard, who
ﬁnished up his ﬁrst season behind Pitt’s
bench.

“It was deﬁnitely a growing season,”
Chouinard said “We ﬁnished the season
competing, even if it was losing by three or
four goals. We were a very underskilled
team, and the guys really picked up the
program towards the end of the season
which helped with a lot of our close
games. We’re leaving the season on a high
note, even with the two losses.”

The Panthers began the season by giv-
ing up 15 goals in one game, but grew into
a competitive team that was able to com-
pete with schools such as the Naval
Academy and Drexel University, despite
youth and inexperience in the college
game. '

This past weekend the Panthers pre-
viewed what is to come next season. After

a 4-1 loss to Rider Saturday aftemoon, Pitt

faced Daniel Webster Sunday afternoon in ~

the consolation game of the tournament.
The team watched as the Eagles jumped
out to a 3-0 lead six minutes into the game.
But Pitt didn’t let Daniel Webster’s offense
go unanswered.

Dave Fryer scored his second goal of
the weekend late in the ﬁrst period to cut
the deﬁcit to two, then forward Jared
Sullivan picked up his own rebound in
front of the net, tallying his ﬁrst goal of the
season to make the game 3-2. .

After Rick Umek scored the Eagles’
fourth goal, Andy Mecs pulled the
Panthers to their second one-goal deﬁcit,
but the Eagles pulled away in the second
period, when they scored four unanswered
goals to take the game, 8-4.; Pitt defense-
man Dave Konn also scored in the loss.

The Pitt defense allowed an over-
whelming 102 shots on goal over the
course of the weekend, but goalie Patrick
Kenny took the offensive barrage in stride.

“It’s my job,” the senior goalie said.
“I’m out there stopping pucks. I’m trying
to stop goals and I’m doing it to the best of
my ability. Stuff like that happens, though.
I’m there, and that’s my job, to stop ﬂiose
shots, even if there are'100 of them.”

COLUMN

As the rule stands now, teams are
put into a dilemma if a newly acquired
player refuses to report. One option is to

FROM PAGES8

"suspend that player. Suspension, howev-

er, means that not only does a team not
get the beneﬁts of a new player, it also
has to deal with the ramiﬁcations of a
disgruntled player, including teammate
resentment and owner/player problems.
The other option if a player refuses
to report is to trade him. Trading, how-
ever, usually ' results in a team getting
substantially less than market value for a
player. In the Seikalycase, the Magic
were forced to trade away one of the
league’s top 10 centers for three scrubs
(center Yinka Dare, guard Kevin
Edwards and forward David Benoit) and

Tuesday, 24 February 1998.

 

a draft pick after Seikaly vetoed the ini-
tial trade. .

I don’t know why Anderson and
Seikaly refused to report. Maybe Kenny
didn’t like Toronto’s 18-year-old drir‘ik-
ing laws or Rony didn’t want to convert
to Mormonism in Utah. ‘

But whatever reasons they had,

something must be done to make sure‘

the players don’t gain too much control
and lose the fans in the process.

Or maybe the NBA should just
reconsider the Latrell Sprewell suspen-
sion and throw all reality out the win-
dow.

“The men just had bad luck all meet,”
Lewis said

The worst luck fell on Carl Taylor.
Considered _a lock to make the ﬁnals of the
500 meters, Taylor was nipped by a runner
who fell in ﬁent of him and therefore did
not ﬁnish his preliminary race.

Taylor redeemed himself in the mile

six hundredths of a second in “one of the
greatest races of the day,” according to
Lewis. The team had a time of 3:13.61 —
its best so far this season.
