Canterbury Meets

The Canterbury C1ub’s final
meeting will be held at 5:30 p.m.
today in Ascension Church. A din-
ner and discussion will follow
services in the chapel. "

‘Key in Lock:

In an interpretive reading, ac-
cording to Rash, “the performers
have the key in the lock and are
ready to open the door to acting.
They do not portray the charac-
ters they are reading, but inter-
prete them for the audience.’

‘_ “Spoon R i v e r Anthology"
‘takes place in a country grave-
yard where each of the persons
buried there tells who and what
he was in life and how he died.
Unity of theme arises from the
interplay between the charac-
ters’ lives and their conflicting

Each member of the cast will
read the parts of several charac-
ters in the graveyard, occasionally
joining together for poetic ducts
and refrains. Theatrical effects
will be limited to special lighting
techniques and interpretive ges-

Admission Free

9‘Our production of ‘Spoon River
Anthology’,” said Rash, “should
provide an enlightening and en-
tertaining evening for all who at-
tend.”

Admission to the reading is free

seniors, and three juniors. Profes-
sor J. P. Watson of the Depart-
ment of Economics, president of
the chapter spoke at the initia-

Tuition Fees

Plan Unveiled

Payment Deferrment

No Longer Allowed
By VIJAY JAIN

In a memorandum mailed to
the student body, the Office
of the Comptroller and Assis-
tant Treasurer of the Univer-
sity announced that the Uni-
versity will no longer allow

deferrment of fees to students
carrying more than eight credits
a trimester. The new policy will
take effect this fall.

for tuition, fees, room and board
for each trimester in order to
complete registration. The Tuition
Plan, Inc. is available for the con-
venience of parents who prefer to
pay these costs in monthly install-
ments,” the letter states.

The tuition plan offered by the
New York enterprise is compara-
ble to education loans now being
offered by some commercial
banks. Parents under 60 in good
health and holding a full time job
may apply for the plan. “Students
regardess of age, may not sign
their own contracts,” the brochure
states. ‘

For one Year

The cost of plan if used for one
year will be four percent more
than the borrowed principal, and
would be repaid in eight equal
monthly installments. A contract
may however be signed for two
three or four years of college costs
at once.

The two year plan would
amount to ﬁve per cent mo;-¢
than the initial sum borrowed
and for the three and four year
plan six percent more than the
initial borrowed sum. These
would be repaid in 20, 30 and

  The Installment Plan

The University’s switch to an outside corporation for
ﬁnancing deferred tuition payment may soon make educa-
tion here an even more complicated, expensive and remote
process than it now is. Either the new plan will entangle
itself in a quagmire of complexities or the harassed student
will become over-burdened with monetary and legal wor-
ries.

The initial premise of ﬁnancing deferred tuition in an
efficient and businesslike way seems simple enough, and
perhaps such a scheme could be smoothly handled by the
University. But the present setup seems to assume that an
«education can be purchased in installments just as one
would buy an automobile or house. Standardized policies
are prepared, money is obtained‘and advanced, andino
I exceptions are made.

Yet a university attracts an extremely wide variety of
persons with an extremely wide variety pf ﬁnancial prob-
lems. Already an exception has been made for foreign
students who are permitted to bring only a limited amount
of money into the country and only for speciﬁed reasons.

Soon those whose education is paid by national grants
and scholarships still allotted on a semester basis will balk
at paying. interest for the time discrepancy between two
I educational systems. *

Older students or those who are paying their own way
may see no reason for their parents to sign for their,,,loans.
Instance after instance will arise in which justice will de-
mand an exception. ‘

To obtain an exception a student presumably, must
' first apply to the University, obtain permission, then for-
C Ward proof of this permission to Tuition Plan, Inc. in New
' York. Not only will the student suffer an inordinate amount
of aggravation, but the New York corporation will ‘either
;discover that it is dealing with almost as many exceptions as
 regular cases or will be continually drafting new policies
to handle the exceptions.

Admittedly the University wasted a great amount of

time and lost money collecting deferred fees under the old
system, but the new plan seems to create more problems
than it will solve, not to mention the added expense and
bother to the student. ,
T If, however, the University were to set ‘up its own de-
iferred payment program, providing a department and staff
to administer the provisions and consider exceptions, it
could reinvest profits into the program as insurance against
I need to increase the now quite liberal terms of the loans.

Review of a Reservist  ..

Dear BR13652822

     

Dear BRl3652822: ,

I was glad to receive your letter yesterday. Boy,
they sure taught my big brother to talk dirty in
the Army. M

Mainly glad to see that the Army ﬁnally gave
you a definite date as to when they're letting you
out. These last couple of weeks.
should go by pretty fast, and
before you know it, you’ll be
back in Pittsburgh, the Gem of.
the‘ East. "

I guess you did get a pretty
raw deal. But I guess you
couldn’t do anything about it.
How did you know there was
going to be a Berlin Crisis last
fall?

Some Crisis, huh? The way
the damn newspapers trumpet
every little thing that happens in Europe, you’d
expect us to be slithering on our bellies under the
Brandenburg Gate next week with fiamethrowers

in our hands. But it looks like the old U. S. Army a

isn’t quite so worried. At least according to the
reports you’ve given me.

Let's see. Your Reserve unit was “called up”
to Active‘Duty last —- October, I think.

Got Your Notice I I

I remember when you got your notice how you
tried to get exempted from going on Active Duty
with the rest of the unit. Oh, I'm not saying that
there was anything dishonorable in your request;
I think you said that practically every other guy
tried to get out of it, too —— including your com-
manding officer. But I think your arguments were
pretty justified.

I remember you told the Army — you said,
“Army, I’m a high school teacher. I’m also work-
ing on my Master's degree in night school. I'm also
married and I've got a son not even one year old
yet. I'll have to drop out of school and lose the
tuition payments I’ve already made for this term.
I’ll have to up and leave work in the middle of the
semester. And how in the world am I going’ to be
able to support my wife and kid on the couple of
bucks the Army allots me for their support?”

Then you got really serious. You said, “Hey,
Uncle Sammy baby, let me lay it on you. I'm
willing to cover myself with khaki if there’s a real
need to. Hell, I guess 1’/ll even eat bullets to pro-
tect my country. But I just don’t like being used

as a political chessman; ‘a psychological weapon
scare Big Nikita. Let's call it off for now arid
when there‘s axreal crisis, well, I'm your man."
But, of course, the Army isn’t interested
listening to soldiers. 
So you and all the rest of the guys in you
unit left your jobs and families and dreams behm
you and marched a thousand miles away -- _
the Glorious South: land of the mint julep, 
chicken, poverty, ignorance and intolerance.
So what kind of “crisis" was going on d 
South? For that matter, what kind of “crisis”iwa§,
going on anywhere? You’ve been gone about t, 
months and I’ve yet to see any ﬁghting going on"
in Berlin. As a matter of fact, I think -the whole“
“Berlin Situation" began to lessen by the time you,‘ 
reached the postiin Dixie. ‘ §
And what do you do down there, anyway? 
First, after deciding to put you through the same 
training course you received when you originally ,
joined ‘the Reserves, they suddenly proclaim that I
your eyesight isn’t up to par. Why the hell didn’l:.. ,
they tell you that when they gave you that ﬁr . 
physical exam for classiﬁcation? ~ "‘"
So they give you a desk job where you can’tW

do any harm. Just make out the payrolls.
And so even then you only work a couple hours

   
 
 
    
 
 

    
    
  

   
       
     
  

   
     
    
  
  
  
  
    
   
  
   
  
  
    
  
    
    
 
  
    
   
 
 

a day. You spend the rest of your time in the _
Army's “Recreation Program.”»« Brilliant. Old 1
Errol Flynn movies. Ping pong.  “
Digs Flynn

Of course, everybody digs Errol Flynn, ping
pong, and other such intellectual pursuits, but I.
guess it’s no substitute for following your career
and living with your family.

By the way, your little old wife is as pretty
as ever. Sure was a shame you couldn't afford to
have her come down with you but, of course, the
Army didn't tell you how long you'd be gone and »
all that. And with the baby, moving would be 
quite a chore. By the way, he's walking pretty
nicely now; but you've probably heard all about
that already.

(Well, it‘ll all be over in a few weeks and you'll
be home. You shouldn’t have much trouble getting
your teaching position back. And there won't be
any more inconveniences. Unless somebody thinks
up another “crisis.”

Take it easy.

Your brother,
Matt

Four Color Morbidity . . .

The Unlunnies

Even as I sit down at my typewriter to amuse
you in my wonted manner, Gentle Readers, re-
verberations of my weekly jaunt with the comic
papers still dance like overripe sugarplums in my
sadder but wiser head. But seek
not to ask me at this critical
juncture why it is that I read
the comics; I could only answer
with some feeble lie, saying that
I got into the habit on my
father’s knee, where I read them
to him. The truth is,‘ that like
some medieval ﬂagellant, I do it
for the dark purpose of torment
and self-abnegation.

Returning however to the
comical papers; it would be well
for those of you who have it handy to seize the
latest Sunday Sunday Compendium and review

along with me the weekend’s multicolored
drolleries.

In one, we find a jolly young lady announcing
her plans to massacre a doctor’s children —- the

primum mobile of this risible gesture being the
exposure by the aforementioned doctor of her
mass—murderer boyfriend. Further hilarity is to
be found in yet another strip, wherein a sexually
frustrated woman tries to combat the advance of
menopause by hiring a pathologically virile young
man as her lover.

And if these don’t have you already clutching
your sides, consider that remarkable strip which
now features an insane girl under the dubious

aegis of. (1) an unscrupulous charlatan and -—- as

events have so to  fully urned, out -3» (2), Ya“

the Tall Dark Professor loves not her real self but
her repulsively disguised self. (Got that? Don’t
look at me if you’re hopelessly lost, go instead to
your local newspaper morgue.) Or Dondi, the
White Prince of Waifdom, surely’ created to proé
vide Job with his juvenile counterpart.
But goshes, folks, this sort of thing can go on
all night. There seems little sense, actually,. in
continuing with what seems a foregone conclusion:
that with the exception of a few more or less _
sophisticated comic strips, the Sunday Chucklers j
-are a grisly collection of Graphic Ma Perkinses, 
Grand Guignol Chop-em-ups and puerile jokes thatprw;
exist on the same level as the artiﬁcially-induced it
belch and plastic vomit.  
There are, however, more significant conclusions “ I
that can be reached by surveying the comic stripsg}

repugnant guise of supermelodramatic hogwash. : 
Nor are these ghoulish tendencies restricted to ,.

Tuition Fees

Plan Unveiled

Payment Deferrment

No Longer Allowed
(Continued from Page 1)

40 consecutive payments.

Parents may cancel the plan
after signing the contract by pay-
ing the amount due, plus an extra
half installment. The two, three
and four year contracts would be
life insured which provides for
payments of the ‘remaining costs
covered by the contract if the par-
ent should die.

Covers All Expenses

The plan covers all college ex-
penses and can be readjusted to
meet increases in tuition and
other expenses after the initial
contract is signed.

The present deferrment offer-
ed by the University itself did
not charge any interest except a
25 cents service charge per in-
stallment. The deferment was
available in four equal install-
ments paid over the trimester.

Asked for reasons in making the
decision, Joseph G. Colangelo,
manager of Information Service
in the University Public Relations
Office, said, “We feel the new
plan will be more efficient, we are
trying to do the job we are here
for —— to give education, thus‘ we
wish to eliminate all undertakings
where we may have to act as a
business enterprise.

Other Large Schools

“Several other large schools are
adopting such plans, and I am
sure severe problems arising from
the new policy will be adjusted,”
he concluded.

Miss Renee Lichtenstein. for-
eign student advisor at the Uni-
versity, said that arrangements
have been made whereby the for-
eign students unable to pay all the
fees at the time of the registra-
tion, will be able to get deferr-
ment in fees from the University.
In order to avoid abuse of this
privilege the students desiring to
have part of their fees deferred
will have to get a letter from the
Foreign Student Office to be used
at the time of registration.
