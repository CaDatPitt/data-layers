Judd to Speak

On Hawaii-

‘Pacific Pivot’

Outstanding Authority
Will Present Views
At Student Assembly

\Vhat the Hawaiian Islands
mean to the United States wil.1
be the theme of a talk, “Hawaii
———Pivot of the Paciﬁc,” by Law-
rence M. Judd, former governor
of Hawaii and member of the
Hawaii Equal Rights commission,
Monday afternoon at 3 o’clock in
Foster Memorial.

Classes will not be dismissed for
the lecture, the oﬁice of the regis-
trar announced.

Long one of the outstanding fig-
ures in the political and business
life of the territory, Judd will make
the University one of his stops on a

good-will tour of the United States.

Purpose of this tour, he reveals, is to
remove some of the current miscon-
ceptions in regard to the Islands, to
win a wider recognition of the com-
mon interests between Hawaii and
Continental United States, , and tq
demonstrate that the Territory has
more than a vacationing aspect.

Ex-Governor Judd comes natur-
ally by his Hawaii enthusiasm. He
was born» in Honolulu, a member of
a family which played an historic
role in the Americanization of the
Islands, down through the reign of
King Kalahaua and the administra-
tion if the provincial government of
the Republic of Hawaii.

Mr. Judd was a member and pres-
ident of the Territorial Senate prior
to his appointment, in 1929, to the
governorship by President Hoover.
Upon the appointment of his suc-
cessor, Joseph B. Poindexter,_he _re-
tired from office in 1934 after near-
ly ﬁve years of service. .

At the outbreak of the World War

he enlisted as a private in the army ‘

Finish Interior

Of Cathedral,
Students Say

Completion of the interior of the
Cathedral ranks as the most, press-
ing feature of Chancellor John G.

Bowman’s eight. point budget plan-

recently presented to the trustees,
preliminary results of a Pitt News
poll among University students re-
veal.

Although pre—pol1 predictions
placed the popularity of the $350,-
000 appropriation for a skating rink
high in the results, returns show
that this item is relatively unim-
portant to students as only three
per cent of those contacted voted
the rink among the ﬁrst three most
pressing needs.

Ranking second to the completion
of the Cathedral, returns show, is
the construction of a $1,400,000
medical research laboratory, since
22 per cent favored the construction
of this medical center’.

The necessity for a student union
building to house restaurants and
University activities ranks high,
students believe, results showing
that 19 per cent of the voters place
this among the top three tentative

plans.

A decided drop is shown between
the third and fourth places of poll
results, since the $200,000 for the
expansion of the chemistry depart-
ment into an improved .Alumni
Hall received 9 per cent of the stu-
dents immediate approval.

Immediate expansion of the athle-
tic facilities is not necessary, Uni-
versity students state, because only
four per cent voted for the con-
struction of improved athletic ﬁelds,
and three per cent favored the
building of a $1,500,000 ﬁeld house.

Construction of a $650,000 addi-
tional engineering laboratory rank-
ed low with a total of three per cent
favoring this idea.

SF A to Discuss
Publicity Rules

Committee Requests

Space, Equipment

Lack of funds has been the one
big drawback to the establishment
of more adequate methods of post-
ing of student and University pub-
licity bulletins, reveals Ted Konet-
sky, C40, chairman of the SFA
building ‘and grounds committee.

Konetsky‘ stated, however, that
the committee would use its “power

of suggestion” at the next meeting‘

of the Student-Faculty assembly,
following examinations, .to._.try _ and
relieve the publicity crisis which
has befallen student organizations
and dance committees since Theo-
dore W. Biddle, assistant dean of
men, intimated that University "pub-
licity regulations ought to be obeyed
more often by students.

Building and grounds committee
is in accord with the ruling that
liandbills should be barred from the
campus. “They aren’t effective,
anl they usually wind up all over
the Commons Room orthe lawns,”
Konetsky pointed out.

One plan advanced by a student
for moreiradvertising asks in addi-
tion to present facilities (1) estab-
lishment of a bulletin board extend-
ing most of the length of the’ corri-
dor opposite telephone booths on
the ground ﬂoor, cost of this board
to be shared by SFA and contribu-
tions from organizations who would
beneﬁt from its use, and (2) the
use of at least two tables for ticket
sales and Independent Party cam-
paigns, these tables to be set out
from the bulletin wall and parallel
to it.

“Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair,”
and “Camptown Races.”

“For this devotion to Pittsburgh’s
great composer, for his founding of
the Foster Hall Collection, for his
gift of this collection to Pittsburgh,
and for his efforts to keep alive the
memory of Stephen Foster and to
maintain public interest in his mu-
sic,”' Mr. Lilly will be presented
with a medal by a committee of
Pittsburgh citizens at a program
sponsored by the Tuesday Musical
Club tomorrow evening.

0n ‘Pinocchio’

That frolicking eighth—floor en-

mor magazine, which last month
hung up one of the highest circula-
tion ﬁgures in recent years, will
strike a new theme when it “goes
Hollywood,” in its campus appear-
ance next Wednesday.

Under the skillful pen of Frank

bring to campus the animated car-
toon success, “Pinocchio,” whose
roly-poly characters will look for
all the worl.d like those of the fain-

It is here that the humor element
will come into the picture, for the
characters from “Gepetto” on ‘down
will have the faces of University
personalities. Running comments
on the animated feature will be sup-
plied by Frank Miller, C40.

Quick Lists Advantages of Making
Early Application for Registration

First step in the annual procedure for second semester regis-
tration will be taken by University students Monday when they re-
ceive the regular study lists at the registrar ’s office.

Study lists for second semester registration must be procured
by all undergraduate students at the office of the registrar, 1817

Cathedral, by Vl-ledncsday, Jan-
uary ].7, J. G. Quick, registrar,
has announced.

Students in the College must
secure their study lists on Mon-
day," January 15, at the regis-
tar’s office from 8:30 o’clock to noon
and from 1 to 4 o’clock. On Tues-
day, January 16, during the same
hours, students in the schools of
Engineering and Mines must call for
their study lists. The lists will be
distributed to students in the schools
of Business Administration, Educa-
tion and Nursing Wednesday, Jan-
uary 17, during the same hours.

Since the numbers on the study
lists will determine times for indi-
vidual registratiin, students apply-
ing for their study lists early on
the days scheduled for their distri-
bution will be assigned earlier hours
at registration, Mr. Quick explains.

Containing complete directions
for registration, study lists are num-
bered serially and will be distrib-
uted in order as students apply for

them. Students must have study lists
in order to register, emphasizes the
registrar.

“No student without a study list
will be admitted to the registration
area in the Commons Room,” Mr.
Quick states.

The nature of the mid-year study
list is such that, before registration,
the student may ﬁll in his present
schedule and his proposed second-
semester schedule in the spaces pro-'
vided, for that purpose on the study
list. Faculty advisers will be on
duty during the registration period
to aid students with their programs;

,Permits to register are being‘
mailed to students in the Graduate
School and to those enrolled in late
afternoon, evening and Saturday
classes. _

“New freshmen entering the Uni-
versity are being admitted daily,”
stated the registrar. “It is estimat-
ed that the total in this group will
exceed 100.” —

Seismology, Other Courses Offered

A new course in Seismology,
taught by Donald C. Bradford, di-
rector of the seismological observa-
tory, will be offered next semester.

The course will be elementary in
nature -and will be concerned with
the possible causes of earthquakes,
study of earthquakes in regard to
knowledge of the interior if the
earth, application of seismological
knowledge to industry, and the gen-
eralconcepts of wave motion.

Junior Prom Chairman Gets
Dance ‘Message from Garcia’

Traveling the greatest distance of
anyone attending the Junior Prom
this year is the ex-Pitt basketball
star, Joseph Garcia, C38, who is ﬂy-
ing from Mari-
caibo, Venezeula,
and has placed
the ﬁrst Univer-
sity formal of the
semester on his
“must” list, ac-
cording to Rob-
ert Shaw, Ed,
chairman, who
recently received
a letter from
Garcia.

Garcia, who
has been working with the Gulf
corporation in South America for
the past two years as a phyhical ed-
ucation instructor, is remembered
for his stellar basketball play while
a member of the University team.

Joe Garcia

 

‘V Because he introduced the -Amer-
lcan Way Of playing basketball to
local South Americans, he has been
made a hero by the people and has
received many medals. While at the
University he played center.

Still feuding with the o-ﬁice of the
dean of men because of the new
publicity restrictions, the dance
committee has placed minute adver-
tisements on novelty snakes which
shoot out of miniature radios when
the dial is turned.

Plans for eliminating the neces-
sity for using handbills will be com-
pleted during the week. Ed Cooke,
C, business manager, warns all stu-
dents to buy their reservation tick-
ets as soon as possible, because
“they’re going fast.”

Tickets are on sale for $4 and res-
ervation tickets can be secured for
a down payment of $1.

.Tuition.lEliso Hits

Students at Tech

Carnegie Tech students will pay more for their
education next year. The announcement of in-
creased tuition rates set by the board of trustees

~ of our neighbor institution indicates a deep-seat

ed financial problem facing all schools which de-

pend on endowment funds for income.

Beginning with the 1940-41 term, Tecl1’s basic
tuition fee will be raised from $150 to $180 per
seinestcr. In addition to this amount, Tech stu-
dents pay a “general fee,” averaging $20 per se-
mester, which covers special student services for
which no charge is made at Pitt.

Costs of education at Carnegie Tech have in
the past been met about half from tuition and
fees, and half from endowment‘ income. Since the
crash of 1929, invested endowment funds of all in-
stitutions and trusts have been receiving a lower
and lower average rate of return. I

To make matters worse, comparatively high-rate
bonds now maturing or being called must be re-
placed with bonds yielding as low as three per
cent, so theiincome of these schools may be ex-
pected to decrease for several years to come.

Faced by the prospect of sharp budget cuts and
severe curtailment of their educational program,
Tech’s trustees found it necessary to jack up tui-
tion charges.

.; Even with this increase, Tech’s rates are low-
er than those in similar Eastern schools. Massa-
chusetts Tech charges $600 per year, Rensselaer
and Johns Hopkins get $450, and Lehigh and Cor-
nell cost $400.

3’ By’ this action, the Carnegie
:reached a difficult solution to the problem of de-
oreased endowment income. .

" 'There’s'a similar problem, though, which Tech
officials should be glad they can avoid. They

don ’t have to depend for support on the good will .

‘of  state legislature.

For President
Here are Republican

Hopefuls for 1940

By Kal Kalwary

The Republican nomination Chasers are already‘
hard at it. Well-publicized is the glamorous Thomas
(Gang-buster, or just plain buster) Dewey. He has
announced his candidacy and is making speeches
about his ideas of national policy. These are bad tac-

tics, for it makes him an easy target for everybody to
shoot at. ,Otherwise, he has all the qualiﬁcations de-
manded of a president. His home state has 45 elec-
'toral votes, which a favorite son could easily swing
to the Republicans. His very youth may be an asset
to be featured. Of course, chasing rats in New York

-does not make him a statesman-—but who wants one‘? V

Cal Coolidge became famous by merely breaking a
~police strike in Boston.
-"Vandenburg, Taft, Bricker

Dewey, however, has the suport of the Hearst

“-"sheets, which is just about the Kiss of Death n0wa- 1

"days. He is believed to have the backing of Hoover

_and Landon, who most likely will not run, but who
lead the “liberal wing” of the party.

Arthur Vandenburg is a wise political worker, who

seems to have some conception of national policy. He '
“has a state machine, but he doesn’t have the “oomph” ’

"the public so adores in Dewey.

' ‘O Senator Taft of Ohio would be an intelligent choice,
"'l:.utihe also lac 's popular appeal. His radio voice is
cheese, though his family name is excellent. H

Governor Bricker of the same state has been com-
mitting political suicide. While trying to keep relief
expenditures down, so that he could be proclaimed to
the nation as a great budget-balancer, he has given
Ohio the national reputation of a state which starves
its city unemployed, when the rural sections are com-

” paratively well-oﬁ.
, Pennsylvania’s James

Senator Styles Bridges of New Hampshire is a

loud-mouth who has a lot of money behindihim. Also

his state is peanuts in the electoral column, and it‘

* isn’t pivotal, either.
It is the peculiar position of Pennsylvania which
"makes Governor Arthur James a good ‘possibility.
' Since it is well-known that a state will vote for its
own candidate, it follows that a candidate from a state
with many electoral votes, and one which is poli-
tically doubtful and may swing to either party, is a
valuable man.

While James has not reduced taxes, nor has he

,. passed any outstanding legislation, his mediocrity,
backed by the oil millions of Texas Colonel Estes, may
take him far.

But you can’t tell in politics, just as in football.
You can only guess that both parties’ nominees for
1940 will come from this list. And, then again, look
what happened to Sutherland.

have been telling my friends, but this is strictly not
to be repeated, that it is the most outstanding dramatic
piece I have ever witnessed, stage, screen, radio, or
imaginary.

   

It isn’t so muchthe story that got me, but I was
convinced by the ﬂawless acting, the excellent pho-
tography, the technical perfection, and meticulous
casting. The story has its merits, however. English
departments have commented that the novel isn’t
much in writing or style; the love routine is the same
in any issue of True Confessions.

Censors Eluded

But that story makesa .ding-whangvmovie.

People ask: Is it like the book? Yes, in embar-

eliminated--the producers announced that in its en-
tirety, line for line, page for page, it would take seven
days, continuous 24 hours a day running, to see it all
—-but there is scarcely one scene, that is missed from
memory. The job of cutting is remarkable.

How about the censorship?
cut the thing in the good parts? No, they didn’t spoil
the sex appeal. Remember the part where Rhett car-

Prospective Educators Face
New Examinations on   Fitness

PHILADELPHIA, Pa.--(ACP)—~
For the ﬁrst time in history, college
graduates who anticipate entering
the teaching profession are facing a
battery of comprehensive examina-
tions that will test their ﬁtness ‘as
educators. ’

The American Council on Educa-
tion has a new teacher testing proj-
ect that leaders of theorganization
believe will be the next great step
in the improvement of education in
the U. S. First use’ of the new ex-
aminations will be next spring in
certain cities in the east andi..mid-
west. ..

Tests ‘Imponderables’

It is the purpose of the special
committee devising the tests to de-
velop a three-fold service, First, a
battery of carefully constructed
tests will be prepared and made
available to the cities cooperating
in the experiment. »

“Second, the committee will give
all. possible assistance to the coop-
erating schools in the sturdy and ex-
change of ideas directed toward the
improvement of all other means of
selecting candidates, including in-
vestigation of the so-called ‘impen-
derables.’

Research Data

“__A third aspect of the service is
that data will be made available for
research in teacher education. Such
research may be carried on either
by the staff working under the di-
rection of the committee or by
teachcr—training institutions taking
part in the project.”

The tests are to include ( 1) “ex—

From the

Sidelines

By Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

It’s just guess work and probably
colored by a bit of bias, but the
boys on what was once the Pitt
hockey team have the feeling that
they would be a cinch to take Ohio-
Penn honors this year if they had
been given the “go” sign from the
Athletic Department.

The boys base their feelings on
the fact that the Duquesne Dukes,
who are knocking the opposition
apart in the John Harris circuit,
are little better offensively than
last year and a great deal less ef-
ﬁcient defensively.

While Alex Iungerich, “sailor
boy” goalie of the 1939 Dukes, was
unorthodox and blessed a bit by
the fates, he had a knack of keep-
ing the puck out of the cage. The
1940 Hilltopper goalie has had con-
siderable difficulty in this most im-
portant of a goal-tender’s func-
tions, and only Bill Vance’s profes-
sional standard of play has kept
the Dukes unbeaten.

The Pitt boys, seeing the per-
formances of other clubs against
the blustering Bluffmen, can’t re-
sist indulging in a little smugness,
a smugness which is in no danger of
being shattered by an engagement
with the Duquesne sextet.

Certainly, Pitt would have been
in good shape to face the 1940 sea-
son. In George Dressler they had
a net-minder who promised to be
a league sensation, and while five
members of last year’s club had
graduated, the boys who remained
formed the nucleus of a ﬁne club.

Walt Lovett, one of the division’s
finest defensemen, was back again,
and was slated to pair with Bill
Schildecker, rangy holdover who
sparked the Panthers in their futile
bid for the league title against John
Carroll.  V

Clyde Shiring and Bob Lowe
were good wings, and Pat Cusick
and Vic Vviliams were coming
along. One loss which might have
been, hard to take would have been
Dick. Friday’s absence from compe-
tition on doctor’s orders.

Strangely, one of the men who
was being counted on most has
neverearned a letter, although a
varsity player for two years. He
was Ozzie “The Terrible” Artz,
who Ilwas benched as a sophomore
by second semester scholastic dif-
ﬁculties, then lost out in the next-
to-the-last game of his junior year
by getting himself suspended. Ozzie
became annoyed by a John Car-
roll man, applied a hockey stick to
his skull, and kicked away his right
to a varsity letter.

Trio of Track
Finds Impress

Cinder Coach

Allen, Larkins, Katz
Display Unexpected
Form During Drills

AS yet, coach Carl Olson’s search
for a successor to the great Johnny
Woodruff has failed to find his
equal, but several prospects, hereto-
lore skipped in lists of possible re-
placements, have been uncovered
in daily practice drills at the indoor
track house.

Three new “finds” who make this
quest much promising for the
Panther track tutor department are
juniors Tom Allen, Regy Larkins,
and Larry Katz. Allen and Larkins
first caught Olson’s eye when they
ﬁnished one-two in the 440-yard
dash in the annual novice intramu-
ral affair last fall.

Neither Allen nor Larkins had
ever donned track togs previous to
last October. Katz, better known
as a member of the famous Jaffe-
Katz Pi Lam passing combine, won
freshman numerals as a sprinter,
but failed to attract much atten-
tion as a varsity cinderman his
sophomore year.

Of the three, Allen comes nearest
the measuring up to Long John in
physical equipment, and appears to
be more ﬁtted for the longer dis-
tances than the other two. His
running features that smooth gli_de
and muscular synchronization re-
miniscent of the Woodruff school.

Although Allen lacks several.
inches of matching the “Ebony Fly-
er” in height, he has a stride that
eats up yardage at an amazing rate.
A broken leg hampered this long-
stretching junior’s activity last year,
but a summer on his farm, 15 miles
from Pittsburgh, strengthened him
considerably.

Exponents of the sprinter school
in running technique, Larkins and
Katz are being groomed for the
quarter mile and the clashes. Lark-
ins, a possible surprise mile relay
entry, carries the same driving
speed exempliﬁed by Larry Tre-
gonning. If early sessions are an
indication of his capabilities, he
may be an answer to Olson’s sup-
plications.

Katz, whose efforts to date have
been marked by a determination
hitherto missing in his training, al-
so hopes to win a berth on one of
the relay teams. Naturally, Frank
Ohl, Hap Stickel, Al Ferrara, Al
McKee, Bul Graf, Tregonning, and
company have not been forgotten,
but the work of the aforementioned
trio is to be watched with interest.

Cage Team Faces Cornell Tomorrow

Pitt Cagers Leave
To Match Big Red

Team at Cornell

Pitt’s cagers entrain tonight for
New York’s cold regions to meet
Cornell’s Big Red basketball team
tomorrow evening. The Panthers
defeated Cornell 50-39 early in the
last year’s season.

This will be the second meeting
of the two teams in as many years
and comparative scores make Pitt a
slight favorite. Both teams have
beaten Ohio State and been trim-
med by Michigan, though it took
the Wolverines an overtime to stop
the Panthers.

The Cornell boys, however, have
the advantage of participating in
four more games than the Panthers.
Pitt has met six opponents, winning
two out of the last three, while
Cornell has bumped up against 10
teams.

This will mark Coach Blair Gul-
1ion’s second season with Cornell,
his ﬁrst season showing a .500 av-
erage with 12 victories balancing‘
12 defeats. The ex-Tennessee ﬂoor
mentor instituted the deliberate of-
fense in the upper New York state
college last year, and toward the
end of the season it was working
smoothly.

At the beginning of the current
season, the Ithicans once again had
difliculty in mastering their once-
found offense. Six lettermen return,
four of them juniors. The other
two are seniors, one of whom is
captain Arky Vaughan, lanky six-
foot ﬁeld go-aler from Springs, Illi-
nois. Other returning lettermen are
Jim Bennett, Howie Dunbar, Ken
Jolly, George Polzer, and Duke
Ramsey. _

Probable starters for the Red
team will be Bennett and Vaughan
at forwards, Ramsay at center, Jolly
and Dunbar or sophomore Bill Ed-
wards at the guards. ’

Pitt, in all probabilties will floor
the same starting team that has
worked in the past three games:
Straloski and Collins at forwards,
Milanovich at center, and,Port and
Kocheran at guards. Senior Jack
Scherer may replace Collins as a
starter, although sophomore R.ipper
has been doing a creditable job.

F orfeits Continue to Mark Competition
In UniVersity’s Intramural League

“Aintcha comin out, aintch comin
out, aintcha . . .” sings Ollie Stiff
as more and more teams forget to
appear for intramural contests.
Over Monday and Tuesday only 12
out of 29 scheluled games took
place.

In the only Independent basket-
ball game played the Newman Club
took their fourth consecutive vic-
tory by downing the YMCA team,
17-12. The Pitt Club received a
forfeit from the Chem Special Srs.
and the Upper Dentures accepted
a gift from the Chem. Special Frosh.

The Chem. Engineers Seniors
waited long minutes to take a for-
feit from the Chem Engineer Sophs
while the Electrical Engineers de-
cided to give their game to the In-
dustrials.

Six Teams Forfeit

Six other teams, the Pre-Meds,
Gamma Gamma Woos, Evening
School, Wolves, B. B. Boys, and
Gypsies, feared to brave the wintry
blasts on the hill and received loss-
es on double forfeits.

The Fraternity boys did much
better, playing all ﬁve of their
scheduled games. The Kappa Sigs
scuttled the Lambda Chis, 38-16.
Phi Gamma Delta defeated the Pi
Lambda Phi aggregation by a 31-
19 score.

PiKA suffered defeat at the hands
of the SAE club, 33-23, while the
Phi Delts rolled up a big score in
downing the Phi Eps, 44-17. Theta
Chi piled up the most points of the
day in defeating Sigma Chi, 50-21.
Handball Results

Five out of eight scheduled hand-
ball games took place as the Kappa
Sigs took one from the Phi Gams,
2-1, and the Lambda Chi Alphas
downed the Phi Eps, 3-0.

The Phi Delts nosed out the Phi
Gamma Delta team, 2-1, and the
Kappa Sigs whitewashed the Delta
Tau Deltas. 3-0.

PiKA took an easy one when the
Phi Eps failed to make an appear-
ance for their match and Delta Tau
Delta took one the same way from
the Phi Delts. Neither the PiKAs
nor the Phi Kappas showed up for
their match and the Pi Lams and
Lambda Chis also received double
forfeits.

One incomplete game was played
in Fraternity table tennis. Phi Kap-
pa leading over Phi Epsilon Pi, 9-0,

Intramural Schedule

when the rest of the match was
halted. Theta Chi forfeited to the
Phi Delts; SAE forfeited to SAM;
and Phi Gamma Delta took a forfeit
from PiKA.

The Gamma Gamma Woos de-
feated the Chem Eng. Specials, 3-0,
in an Indepenlent bowling contest,
and the Industrial Engineers took
one from the Chemical Engineer
Srs., 2-1. The Punks forfeited to
the Amity Club.

In Independent volleyball, the
Newmans forfeited to the Punks

and the EEs and the Punks both re-
ceived losses on a double forfeit.

League Plans  
Hit New Snag‘

Plans for the freshman basket-
ball league have hit an unforseen
snag with the disclosure that only
ten members of this year’s frosh
class are reporting regularly to
coaches “Doc” Carlson and Dr.
Zehfuss.

Freshman basketball coach
Zehfuss emphasized that more
boys are needed if the league is
to be a success. Those boys wish-
ing to register for the league still
haxe until Tuesday to do so, ac-
cording to Dr. Zehfuss.

The league was organized» in
order that those boys of the fresh-
man class who are interested in.
playing basketball’: may have a
chance to engage in competition;
Since no outside games are per-
mitted the fro-sh, this is the only
opportunity for the future var-
sity players to gain experience in
competition.

Actual play in the league will
not start until after the examina-
tions are over, and then only if
enough boys turn out.

WAA Board Discusses
Modern Dancing Film

Highlighting the WAA board
meeting Tuesday was a discussion
of the movies on modern dancing
which are to be shown here Jan-
uary 18. Three Pittsburgh colleges,
the University of Pittsburgh, P. C.
W., and Carnegie Tech will show
these movies.

A second feature of the meeting
was the advancement of plans for
the entertainment for freshmen
scheduled to take place in February.
At the freshmen party, refresh-
ments will be served on the twelfth
ﬂoor; then everyone will go to the
Cathedral gym for games and danc-
mg.

Panther Dribblers
Beat Westminster
Basheteers, 47-35

After passing and shooting with
equal listle-ssness throughout a slow
first half, Doc Carlson’s proteges
drew away from Grover Washa-
baugh’s Titans early in the third
quarter, and turned a close con-
test into a rout as they soundly

' trounced their foe, 47-35, on the

Stadium
night.
In a game that had been dead-
locked five times at 2-2, 9-9, 11-11,
18-18, and 27-27, the Panthers sud-
denly unleashed all the pent-up
punch that has made them a po-
tentially great combination all
season. Previous to Wednesday,
the Blue and Gold clad cagers

had failed to tally more than 35
times in any of their six encoun-
ters.

In winning their second straight
victory and their third in seven
starts, the “glamor boys” were led
by diminutive George Kocheran,
junior forward, who broke the
third period 27-27 tie with a bucket
and free throw. Kocheran shared
the Pitt individual scoring honors
with John Pataky, second string
center, who registered 10 markers.
Lefty Ed Ziolkowski, sophomore
forward, came next with nine.

Dies Committee

Investigations

AUSTIN, TEX., January 11-
The Dies Committee for investi-
gating un-American activities,
which has included some of the
nation ’s colleges in its inquiries,
should be continued, a majority
of U. S. student believes.

This is the result of a poll taken
by the Student Opinion Surveys of
America shortly before Congress
convened again.

But it should
be pointed out
that although 56
per cent say
t h at m o n e y
should be ap-
propriated for
the committee
to go on with its
work, this study
of campus senti-
ment is not to be
interpreted a s
an approval of
all the legislator
from Texas and
h i s associates
have done.

Students often voiced their dis-
satisfaction with the methods and
results of the committee, it was re-
ported by the national staff of inter-
viewers that the Surveys uses.

Asked, “Do you think the govern-
ment should provide money to con-

Martin Dies

University students agree with
the opinions of college students
throughout the country in the ad-
visability of Congress supplying
sufficient funds for the continua-
tion of the Dies Committee for an-
other year.

The "recent campus poll shows
that of students interviewed,
three-fourths are in favor of the
work of the committee.

 

tinue the Dies committee for an-
other year?” students everywhere
answered, YES, 56 per cent, NO, 26
per cent. There was a large num-
ber,’ 17 per cent, who had no opin-
ion, many admitting they had never
heard of the committee.

The Surveys ﬁnds. that out of
nearly three dozen subjects it has
used in its polls this is one of the
least known. A majority of those
who did know it, however, believe
that the investigation of “isms” in
this country is desirable and neces-
sary.

A year ago the Surveys found
that only one out of every ten stu-
dents believed there had been any
attempt to influence him.

By sections, those wishing the
Dies committee continued were:

New England . . . . . . .44 per cent

Educators Ask
Congress to End
Dies Committee

Coincident with the report by
the Student Opinion Surveys of
a nationally conducted student
poll which revealed that collegi-
ans endorse the Dies connnittec
and favor its continuance, the
American Committee for Democ-
racy and Intellectual Freedom an-
nounced that more than one hun-
dred leading educators, writers,
scientists, and public leaders have
petitioned Congress urging the un-
qualified discontinuance of the
Committee for Investigation of Un-
American Activities.

Actions of the Dies Committee,
the petition states, “constitute an in-
fringement upon the democratic
rights of freedom of speech and as-
sembly at a time when the reper-
cussion of the international situation
in our country make it all the more
imperative that we adhere rigidly
to both the letter and the spirit of
the Bill of Rights.”

Professor Franz Boas, national
chairman of the ACDIF, revealed
that a report on the official proceed-
ings of the Dies Committee, “re-
vealing the menace to education and
free discussion inherent in 7 the
premises on which the committee
and its witnesses operate,” will be
made public later this week.

Undemocratic procedures charged
against the Dies Committee in the
petition were (1) the use of witness-
es withoutinquiring” into their rec-
ord and credibility, and (2) the pub-
lication of hearsay testimony, of-
fered without supporting evidence
and without opportunity for rebut-
tal.

Signatories to the petition includ-
ed 12 college presidents and six
deans in addition to the. assemblage
of nationally-known ﬁgures in
every branch of American life.

Among those gendosing the peti-
tion were: Dr. Clarence M. Dykstra
of the University of Wisconsin; Dr.
Guy Stanton Ford, University of
Minnesota; Dr. Frank Kingdon of
the University of Newark; Dr. Wal-
ter Dill Scott, Northwestern univer-
sity; and Dr. Mary E. Woolley, Mt.
Holyoke college.

Other signatories included: Har-
old C. Urey, Nobel laureate in
chemistry; John Dewey; Charles A.
Beard; Christian Gauss of Princeton
university; Malcolm MacLean of
the University of Minnesota; and
Frank L. Mott of the University of
Iowa school of journalism.

Tuck Shoppe
To Open Soon

The new Tuck Shop will start
operating February 1 pending the
expected completion of work by all
the trades concerned, it was an-
nounced today by Albert Klimcheck,
University architect.

Beginning next semester, stu-
dents may patronize the new shop
located on the Bigelow boulevard
side of the ground ﬂoor.

Air conditioning equipment will
be featured in the Tuck Shop. In-
direct lights will be mounted in the
white cork ceiling, which will pro-
vide sound insulation for the room.

The blonde maple tables and
chairs will be trimmed with red
leatherette. Benches will be ar-
ranged in horseshoe patterns against
the ivory plastered walls to form
small alcoves. The seating capac-
ity will be between 100 and 110.

The terrezza floor with brass
stripes will cover the 18x80 feet
area. Decorating the windows will
be white Venetian blinds edged
with red tape. A maple serving
counter and stainless steel soda
fountain will complete the furnish-
ings of the lunch room.

The old Tuck Shopwill remain
open and will probably be redeco-
rated at a later date.
