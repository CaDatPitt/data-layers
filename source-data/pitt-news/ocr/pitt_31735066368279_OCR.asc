Geography Saga
Comes To An End
After Debate

The seven-year battle over the
future of - Pitt’s geography
department ended in November
when Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var decided to close it.

That decision came shortly
after Provost Rhoten Smith, cit-
ing low enrollment and poten-
tial savings to the university,
recommended its closing to
Posvar.

The closing, effective fall,
1983, will affect 22 undergradu-
ate majors, 12 graduate students
and five faculty members.
Three of the five faculty who are
in the tenure stream, will be
reassigned to other de-
partments.

The decision ends specula-
tion about geography’s future,
which began in 1977 when
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
dean Jerome Rosenberg first
talked about eliminating the
department.

Several faculty committees‘

advised against such a move.
But in May 1982, Rosenberg
decided to proceed with a Plan-

ning Resource
Systems proposal.

Management

A special senate committee
analyzed that proposal along
with the recommendations of
four faculty committees that
favored continuing the depart-
ment. The committee rejected
the dean's proposal in October.

Geography department grad-
uate students contended that
the department’s problems were
the result of inaction by Rosen-
berg. They claimed he had
promised to revitalize the
department but never fulfilled
it. They resubmitted a grie-
vance against the dean to
Smith, which charged the dean
with breach of integrity.

However, in a memoto the
University Senate, Smith said
that he did not consider geo-
graphy a high academic prior-
ity. He said examples of
programs he considered central
to the university are English
and chemistry. “The same is
not true of geography," he said.

Football Season Disappointing

The fall term of 1982 was a
big term for Pitt sports teams.
The Panthers were ranked No. l
at the beginning of the season,
and Danny Marino was a prime
candidate for the Heisman
Unfortunately, the

"re-season hype did not predict
reality on some of the Saturday
afternoons this fall.

Foge Fazio and Ed Bozik
made their debuts as head coach
and athletic director respec-
tively and were being watched
by Pitt administrators and fans
alike. Fazio was hailed as a
Pittsburgh’ boy who chose to
stay in town and coach the
Panthers to a National
Championship.

The Panthers opened with a
nationally-televised game
against the North Carolina Tar
Heels in Three Rivers Stadium.
The Panthers won the squeaker
7-6.

Hundreds of Mountaineers
traveled to Oakland for the Pitt-
West Virginia game on Oct. 2.
Both Pitt and West Virginia

rivals squared off against one

another. The audience got their
money’s worth when Pitt, down
by 13, came back in the fourth
quarter to win the game 16-13.

All hopes for a national
championship all but died on a
cold day in November when
Pitt played the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame in Pitt stadium.
The sell-out watched as the
Irish devastated the Panthers,
31-16.

Following the Pitt-Rutgers
game, the Panthers were invited
to Dallas to play in the Cotton
Bowl against Southern Metho-
dist University. Fazio and the
Panthers accepted the bid amid
cries of "].R., ].R.” Underlying
the joys of the bid, however, was
the fear of the Pitt-Penn State
game that was to be played the
day after Thanksgiving.

The annual bull-fight
between the two Pennsylvania
schools was played in Happy
Valley this year» and, as usual,
the weather was rotten. The
game was a nail-biter through
most of the 60 minutes and
because of some questionable
calls by Fazio, the Panthers lost

Frat
Brawl

What some termed a large-
scale brawl broke out at a Pitt
fraternity in mid-September
that prompted an investigation
by university and fraternity
officials.

Ralph Nader

P.J. 0’Rourke

Campus and city police
rushed to Zeta Beta Tau frater-
nity house after a fight erupted
into a “near riot” between ZBT,
Delta Tau Delta fraternity
brothers and some non-
fraternity members.

Several people who were
there for a party became per-
turbed, according to ZBT offi-
cials, when they were asked to

leave the house.
Campus police officials esti-

-mated the number of people at

the scene at 50, but some
observers said the crowd outside
the fraternity may have num-
bered close to 300.

Interfraternity Council (IFC)
and ZBT officials refused to
comment to the press about the
incident.

Diverse Mixture of

Speakers Comes
to Lecture at Pitt

products and industries. Hem

This term brought a host of
diverse speakers to the Pitt cam-
pus. G. Gordon Liddy,
Timothy Leary, George
McGovern, Ralph Nader and
Julian Bond were only a few of
the national figures that spoke
on important issues.

The Liddy-Leary debate was
sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council and was widely publi-
cized, hence it was sold out. The
debators, although they traded
some jabs and insults, main-
tained a friendly attitude
towards one another. After the
debate, the “enemies” admitted
they held a respect for each
other and were friends off the
stage.

Georgia Senator Julian Bond
spoke in early November as the
headliner to the Black Action
Society’s annual Black Week.
He had harsh words for the Rea-
gan Administration, saying
that with Reagan's 1980 elec-
tion, a new form of “social Dar-
winism” was born. Bond
termed it survival of the richest
and said he feared the plight of
Americans who were in real
need of life’s necessities. _

Consumer activist Ralph
Nader was another PPC-
sponsored lecturer. Nader told
the audience that today’s consu-
mers have to change the way
they view the economy if they

want to improve the quality of

said consumers see the products
they buy from a corporate point
of view instead of the buyer‘s
perspective, as they should.

Former Senator George
McGovern said the United
States faces... economic catas-
trophe and a decay in the qual-
ity of its life if it does not bring
‘the arms race under control. He
said that the U.S. should be
spending money on its decay-
ing physical structures, like
bridges and buildings, instead
of increasing the military
budget.

Perhaps the funniest and
most interesting lecture was
given by former National Lam-
poon editor P.J. O'Rourke. He
said that today’s generation is
too mannerly and that young
people should act up more
often, but be cute about it.

“The best way to act up in a
general way is to act weird,”
O’Rourke advised. “My genera-
tion used up all the weird—if
something was weird, we
smoked it.”

Other less publicized lectur-
ers included Alejandro Molina
Lara, an El Salvadoran union
leader, who spoke about the
government atrocities in his
country and C. Everett Koop,
the U.S. Surgeon General, who
warned that family violence is
nearing epidemic proportions.

—Page 5

An Issue At Pitt

Alcohol use became"an issue
on campus when both adminis-

'l’— trators and students organized

task forces to study Pitt’s alco-
hol policies.

Vice-chancellor for Student
Affairs Conney Kimbo
announced in September that
his office was forming a com-
mittee to study alcohol educa-
tion on campus, diagnosis and
treatment available for alcohol-
ism and current university reg-
ulations on its use.

Kimbo said the committee
did not include students
because it is a fact finding com-
mittee, and students would not
be involved until after the com-
mittee made its recom
mendations.

A task force of the Resident
Student Association announced
last week that it would also

response to fears that adminis-

Schenley
Renovations

Renovations of Schenley
Hall progressed throughout the
term with many students hav-
ing to sacrifice a place to hang
out for a more modern facility.

Most of the student groups
were in their new homes by the
first week of classes and the new
furniture was moved in to the
offices in mid-november.

Workers also began to piece
together the atrium in the space
between the student union and
Schenley Quadrangle. Work on
the lobby also began this term.

During Christmas break, the
workers will be revamping the
old elevators and replacing
them with ones in better condi-
tion. The lobby and entrances
vill also be worked on during,
this time when traffic in Schen-
ley Hall will be at a minimum.

tration committee might set
overly stringent rules.

Valerie Jachimowicz, presi-
dent of the RSA force, said she
does not believe there is an alco-
hol problem on campus. She
said the student group will sur-
vey residents about their alco-
hol use and look at alcohol
policies on other campuses
before recommending what
changes, if any should be made
in current policy.

“We want to propose an alco-
hol policy that will encourage
responsible use without totally
banning it on campus,” she
said.

The RSA task force will bring
its recommendations to the
Office of Resident Life next
term. If its recommendations
are ignored, “our next step is to
try and get the resident students

fired up,” Jachimowicz said.

Students Display
Little Interest
In Arms Race

Despite the seemingly tireless
efforts of the Arms Race Study
Group, student concern and
interest in the nuclear arms
‘question never developed.

Take Candidate’s Night, for
example. That was back on Oct.
15, and to say that there were 30
people there would be stretch-
ing it. To say that half were stu-
dents would be stretching it
even further.

The candidates who were fea-
tured weren’t the big time poli-
ticians whose policies, or lack
of them, could shape America’s
future.

Two candidates from the
Socialist Worker’s Party, a
Libertarian and a Democrat
were present. Their messages
ranged from a call to wrest the

ability to wage war from the
rulers to a call for greatly
reduced foreign military aid
and a call for people to speak
out against the arms race in

town meetings and referen-.
dums. But few were there to_

hear the call.

This event set the tone for dis-
cussions on the arms race
between the U.S. and Soviet
Union at Pitt.

Students at Pitt were not
alone when it came to presenta-
tions on the arms race and for
the most part, students at other
schools didn’t seem to care
much either.

On Nov. 11, educational
events were held at over 500 col-
leges and universities around
the country, including Pitt.

Student attendance at these con-
vocations was generally po9_r.
Pitt English professor Liane
Norman attributed the low
attendance to student priorities.

\

“They’re more worried about
their career goals or their rela-
tionships,” she said. This senti-
ment was echoed around the
country. i

Two students were injured

and two rrested in late
November hen the Islamic
Union o 'raqi students
attempted ) hold a meeting in

the Forbes Quadrangle to dis-
cuss alleged atrocities coinmit—
ted against Muslims by Iraqi
president Saddam Hussein.

About 50 members of a pro-
Htissein group, armed with
knives and clubs, blocked the
door to the meeting and began
battlingiwith Islamic Union
members. City and campus
police were called to break up
the fight.

Hushan Husainy, a represen-
tative of the Islamic Union, said
the pro—Hussein group con-
sisted of students flown to Pitts-
burgh to break up the meeting.
He called the group members
“secret police" of the Hussein
regime.

Director of student activities
Andy Smith acknowledged
after the incident that the
Islamic Union had improperly
placed an ad in the newspaper
because it did not list the spon-
soring group. He said his office
would look into the matter.

Pitt students perfected th rt of tr

Certain weeks were special at
Pitt this term.

Pitt held its 12th annual Jazz
Seminar on Nov. 4, 5 and 6.
Seminars on the various aspects
of the music business and jazz
instruments were held in the
Frick Fine Arts Building during
the three day event.

The seminar closed with a
concert in Carnegie Music Hall
that featured seminar guests,
including Grover Washington,
]r., Miroslav Vitous, Terurnasa
Hino, Monty Alexander, Ted
Dunbar, Alex Acuna and
Nathan Davis.

An offspring of the jazz
Seminar is the Jazz Hall of

Fame, created in 1977. The
objectives of the Hall of Fame
are to make Pittsburgh the
world center for jazz recogni-
tion, to establish a perpetual
place of recognition for jazz
artists and to annually elect two
artists, composers or writers to
the hall.

In November, the‘ Black
Action Society sponsored its
annual Black Week, which fea-
tured Georgia, State Senator
Julian Bond, poet Nikki Gio-
vanni, musician Gil Scott-
Heron, the Kuntu Repertory
Theatre and the rhythm and
blues band Pieces of A Dream.

Programs Cut

Players and coaches were
caught by surprise when
athletic director Ed Bozik

announced that men’s volley-
ball and women’s field hockey
were being cut by the sports
program because of a lack of
money.

Bozik said the decision came
after 18 months of discussion
and the action was approved by
Chancellor Wesley Posvar,
Vice—Chaiice1lor Jack Freeman
and the United States Senate.

Bozik said it was not an easy

Merry (Ihrislnias

decision for him to make, but
the sports department had to do
something about the funds
reduction it was facing from the
university.

He defended the action by
saying that he wants to improve
the quality of the depai't_meijit,
but could not do that with the
existing budget—something
had to be cut.

The people involved in the
two sports were l)oth shocked
and upset with Bozik's decision.

Another Year, .
Another Board

With the end of the Fall term, the year in‘
office for members of the Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) will come to a close.
Looking at the board’s work over the past
year, successes are hard to find.

The failure of SGB to achieve its most
touted objective--mandating student eva-
luations of teaching—is, perhaps, under-
standable. It was difficult to tell whether the
SGB embraced that goal as a means to
improving the quality of teaching at Pitt or
as a play for publicity. Still, it will take
more than nine students more than 12
months to overcome the obstacles to insti-
tuting such a change. Next year’s board
would do well to continue this effort,
improving on their predecessors’ failure to
draw a realistic and productive plan of
action.

The board’s failure to improve commun-
ications with students and. student
groups——an improvement promised by
every candidatein last year’s election——was
more dismaying. The board must decide
how to allocate funds among the many rec-
ognized organizations; therefore it would
be unrealistic to expect smooth relation-
ships between the board and these groups.

There is, however, much room for the
relationship between the board and its
standing committees to be improved. These
committees are, in theory, charged with car-
rying out such work as the board directs. In
practice, they are often left to operate-or to
flounder--as separate groups isolated from
the board.

Looking ahead to next year, the incom-
ing board will be confronted with the effects
of a declining university budget. In that
climate, it is essential that the SGB prepare
to positively and effectively protect stu-
dents’ interests. The new board, like the old,
will find how little it can achieve without
careful planning and the cooperation of its
standing committees. Let us hope it learns
this lesson soon.

Med School -Examined

Dear Editor:

Events this past month have
brought pride and sorrow to the
campus, pride from the national
recognition accorded our language
and philosophy departments for
their steadfast commitment to
scholarship and excellence and sor-
row for the shameful and deceitful
manner in which administrators in
the Cathedral, for want of$150,000,
dissolved the geography depart-
ment. Many thoughtful people fear
that if faculty members of this uni-
versity do not become better
informed and more actively
involved in the significant issues
that prevail, we will have cause for
a lot more sorrow and much less
pride in our institution.

As a beginning we would do well
to focus our attention on the
School of Medicine. While stu-
dents and faculty on the under-
graduate campus struggle to
optimize the use of their dwindling
resources, the medical school con-
tinues to drain away $3 million
each year from undergraduate tui-
tions and the general operating
budget of the university.

Dean Leon argues that this 353
million really belonged all along
to the medical school. For years he
has misled inquirers by stating that
this money simply replaces the $2-3
million a year that grants and the
clinical practice plans of the
School of Medicine have been pro-
viding to Posvar’s general univer-
sity budget.

But the facts don't support
Leon's contention. A committee of
the faculty senate, chaired by Dr.
Richard Pratt, which is investigat-

4 ing the medical school, has learned

that previously agreed upon for-
mulas that should have resulted in
the return to the Cathedral of
revenues from overhead on federal
research grants and the practice
plans have not been honored.
Thus, in addition to the $3 million
siphoned from undergraduate pro-
grams, the medical school has
withheld another $2-3 million
from the university's general oper-
ating budget.

How is this money used in the
School of Medicine? How can a
medical school awash in $50 mil-
lion in profits from clinical serv-
ices rendered by faculty members
be in such academic and fiscal diffi-
culties? Before considering these
questions, bear in mind that over
the past 3-5 years Pitt’s medical
school has become the most expen-
sive state-supported medical
school in the country, but, at the
same time it has dropped from the
list of the top 15 medical schools in

has seen its accreditation by the
Liaison Committee on Medical
Education drop from 8 years to a
2-year period of probation. One of
the few areas of growth and

‘The medical school
continues to drain away
$3 million each year
from undergraduate
tuitions.... ’

prosperity in the'S(_:hool of Medi-
cine in recent years has been in the
clinical practice plans, the secret
corporations that proliferated
while the School of Medicine" and
the university deteriorated.

The same year that medical
school tuition rose by an unprece-
dented $2,600, the department of
pathology and several others
secretly granted each of their
faculty members——university
faculty members, mind you-
$2,000 worth of free dental care. So

instead of a department» of geo-
graphy, we now have a pathology
department composed of faculty
members with the very best oral
cavities that practice planmoney
can buy. (One pathologist com-
plained to me recently: “Do you

for dental work when you alrea ix.”
have a good mouth?" He further“

complained that if he didn’t spend
the $2,000, he couldn’t carry the
money over to the next year.) Sadly
though, the competition between
practice plan chairmen to shower
monetary benefits on their own
faculty members has proven to be
an extremely efficient way to stifle
dissent.

Revenues generated by the prac-
tice plans, revenues which might
have provided tuition relief and
been used to
rebuild the demoralized basic
science departments, have been
diverted instead into enormous

salaries unmatched in growth rate..-

Poor Communicators

Dear Editor:

I would like to express my con-
cern ahout a major problem at this
university—the ability of profes-
sors to teach. This statement may
seem paradoxical, but I am sure
many students know exactly what I
am talking about. Quite simply,
professors may be highly educated
individuals. But if they lack the
skills to effectively communicate
that knowledge to their students,
what, then, is their true worth?

All too often I have been in
classes where the professor talks
above his students, taking for
granted we can easily grasp con-
cepts which, to him, are second
nature. This problem may be com-
pounded by professors who have
not yet mastered the English
language.

Often these communication
problems result in a professor’s
failing a large portion (perhaps 40
percent) of the class. In such a case,
the professor may be put on proba-
tion for a term, but the student is
permanently affected. He has lost
time and money, and most impor-
tantly, his transcript is marred by a
failing grade.

What actually prompted me to
write this letter is an experience I
have had with a professsor who,
although he speaks the English
language quite well, lacks the abil-
ity to communicate with his stu-
dents. His strong points are his

thought—going off on tangents-i-
and not speaking clearly when try-
ing to make a point. After every
lecture the class leaves in a state of
confusion and is forced to depend
on a difficult textbook to clear the
air.

I am sure that this professor—-
like most professors—is quite
intelligent. But if he can’t convey
his knowledge to me or the rest of
the class, is he really doing his job?
I hope faculty will keep this ques-
tion in mind when preparing their
next lecture.

By RON BARBER

Pitt has set a dangerous
precedent by pitting its athletes
against teams from communist
nations. Last month it was the
basketball team in a game
against a team from Yugosla-
via, and this month our gym-
nasts will meet a Russian group
in an exhibition match.

Have we not learned, from
the Nixon-Ford days, that such
seemingly insignificant sports
competitions can be the start of
most dreadful habits of cooper-
ation between the free and com-
munist worlds? Have we
forgotten that the innocuous
Ping-Pong matches with the
Chinese a decade ago resulted in
an American president visiting
Peking?

Today we all realize the evils
of detente and shudder at the
thought of any feelings of East-
West trust rearing their ugly
heads again. And our president,
Mr. Reagan, has worked long
and hard to eradicate any tenu-

Dangerous Games

ous feelings of trust that might
have stuck as thorns in our side.
As a result, we can safely pro-
pose any arms reduction plan
we want, secure in the knowl-
edge that neither we nor the
Reds trust each other enough to
sit down at the bargaining
table.

We must realize the danger
that a series of small acts of
trust—such as these athletic
exhibitions—may add up to a
new spirit of cooperation. We
must tremble with fear at the
spectre of gifts being exchanged
between contestants of the two
sides. We must cry with outrage
at the possibility that our boys
will actually talk with the com-
mies and—horror of horrors-
discover that they are people
with mothers and brothers, who
fear nuclear annihilation as
much as we do.

We have to recognize the
danger lurking in these seem-
ingly innocent games. We have
to stop them before it’s too late!

Dear Editor:

George McGovern appeared
here last Tuesday night before
a somewhat small but highly
appreciative audience. As I sat
in that cavern called David
Lawrence Auditorium, I could
not help but. wonder how the
Pitt Program Council could
have improved upon the even-
ing. At the risk of sounding pre-
sumptuous, here are a few
modest suggestions.

First, think before you sched-
ule. I assume ‘that PPC, likeiany
promoter, wants to pack the
house for a guest speaker. With
this goal in mind, why, oh why,
did PPC almost guarantee itself
a small crowd by scheduling
Senator McGovern (a) in the
final week of the term, when
many students are more worried
about grades than politics and
(b) on the same nightas the Pitt-
Duquesne basketball game?
Scheduling speakers is no
doubt complicated by the avail-
ability of dates and other fac-'
tors. but we might have been

A Bit Less Surreal, Please

better off if PPC had waited
until next term, and on an even-
ing with no major competition.
Why shoot yourself in the foot?
Second, think before you

speak. Those who are granted ~
or take on the honor of intro-
ducing a major guest should at
least know something about
that person before speaking.
Senator McGoverr1 was unfor-
tunately treated to a perfunc-
tory (perhaps this was a
blessing) and rather amateurish
introduction by a person who
obviously knew little more
about the senator than what he
read from a promotional biog-
raphy. Said PPC functionary
also made us all look rather silly
by interrupting the crowd’s
applause after the speech to
breathlessly inform us that
future PPC happenings
included talks by “Father Mul-
cahy" from “M”“A"‘S"“H” and
the author of that noted literary
masterpiece, How to Make
Love to a Woman. Great tim-
ing, fella. Makes me wonder if
there is an overriding theme to

PPC's lecture series.

Finally, try a little considera-
tion. The very minor PPC func-
tionary who blasted Styx over
the loudspeaker-—or was it For-
eigner? REO? Who could
tell?——while some of us talked
with the senator after his speech
obviously didnot think before
heacted. (Who knows, maybe
this guy is a Christina Clinton
critic making some point about
rock.) At the very least he might
have played something more
befitting a former U.S. senator
and not the Wednesday night
flick. I shudder to think what.
he'll dig up for the author of
“How to Make Love to a
Woman.” Rick James,
perhaps?

Regardlessof these points, I
do commend PPC for bringing
Senator McGovern to Pitt. I
wonder, however, whether PPC
could make future presenta-
tions a bit less surreal.

Med School Needs Dose Of Accountability

continued from page ten

and size by those at comparable
medical schools. Hopefully, Pratt’s
committee will document the
unconscionable growth of income
and benefits’ that our anesthesiolo-
gists, surgeons and radiologists
have realized from their unregu-
lated private corporations that are
sheltered by the Pitt logo. It is not
surprising that Dean Leon has
commanded all departmental
chairmen in the medical school to
refrain from communicating with
Pratt’s committee.

The practice plans have had an
adverse effect on many other
important aspects of the School of
Medicine as well. These negative
watershed effects stem from one
outstanding property of the prac-
tice plan programs at Pitt; instead
of a single common clinical prac-
tice plan like most medical schools

employ, the School of Medicine
has 15 separate corporations.

Thus, rather than one corpora-
tion governed by a strong central
figure, namely the dean, who
should exert ultimate control of
funds, we have an impotent dean
who is dean in name only, domi-
nated by 15 powerful and auto-
nomous department heads, each of
whom controls enormous sums of
money.

When the practice plans were

_being‘.fon:ried, -cli-riieal-faeuky-who

were reluctant about the concept
were jokingly encouraged by their
colleagues that the medical school
corporations were capable of pro-
viding their members with condos
at Hilton Head; anyone who
appreciates the power and wealth
of the practice plan corporations
will not be surprised to learn that
the joke has become reality.

It is a basic element of human
nature that he who earns the
money wants to spend it. Even if
every practice plan chief were intel-
ligent and thoughtful, it is doubt-
ful if institutional efficiency and
concerted purposeful good could
be achieved from the uncoordi-
nated efforts of 15 independent and
strong-willed departmental chair-
men. Little progress is possible
with 15 such ambitious persons
preoccupied with their own ego,
engaged in finding short cuts to
fame or new possessions.

The concentration of power and
money in the hands of numerous
practice plan chiefs have pro-
foundly subverted the basic educa-
tional and investigative purposes
of the School of Medicine. It has led
to:

0 Violations
practices;

0 Disregard for affirmative
action guidelines;

0 The hiring of mediocre clones
of the ol’ boys’ club, whose only

of fair hiring

certainty is that they will go on to
become tenured deadwood;

O A sharp increase in qualifies
promotions without tenure;

0 Fewer faculty members from
clinical departments which are
funded -by external agencies like
the National Institutes of Health

‘It is a basic element of
human nature that he
who earns the money
wants to spend it. Even
if every practice plan
chief were intelligent
and thoughtful, it is
doubtful if good could
be achieved.... ’

and the National Science Founda-
tion (instead they consume large
amounts of practice plan revenues
such that precious locally-
generated funds are now squan-
dered by the underwriting of
incompetent researchers rather
than used to support more worth-
while activities);

0 Fewer poor people being
treated at the five Health Center
hospita1s——they are being denied
mainstream medical case;

0 A serious decline in the morale
of students in the School of Medi-

cine who now believe, based on the
hiring practices they see used in the
medical school, that hard work,
intelligence and productivity will
not help them find a job—they see
that jobs are filled by professional
nepotism.

Our responsibility as faculty
members extends beyond teaching
and research; we have a responsi-
bility to the community What
more noble way is there of provid-

ing community service than by"

engaging in an analysis and con-
structive debate aimed at identify-
ing solutions that will compel this
giant and once great university to
begin serving once again the inter-
ests of the commonwealth and all
the taxpayers who sustain it?

We can all participate by
demanding accounta‘bility of the
School of Medicine. There is no
justification for permitting prac-
tice plan chiefs with faculty rank
from exempting themselves and
their corporations from traditional
investigational jurisdiction to
which every other school and
department in the University of
Pittsburgh are subject. How much
money is raised by the physician-
faculty members of the corpora-
tions, how is it generated, what
formulas govern its disposition,
what university-wide peer group
oversees the practice plans, and
what is their impact-on -academic

programs and standards, both in
the School of Medicine and the
entire university? What goes on in
the medical school affects all of us.
We need more facts and the Pratt
committee has a right to this
information.

A practice plan is like the wind.
When harnessed by a sail or a wind-
mill it can benefit mankind, but
when uncontrolled as in a hurri-
cane, it can cause much suffering.
As presently constructed, the
university-sanctioned clinical cor-
porations are causing much suffer-
ing. It is unfortunate and perhaps
even tragic that Chancellor Posvar
permitted and even condoned the
creation of such significant pro-
grams in secrecy and without
proper debate or discussion. It is
time to correct this serious error. As
faculty members of an institution
supported in large part by taxpay-
ers, we are obligated to play a role
in ensuring that it serves the public
interest and welfare. As members of
the clinical faculty are not about to
heed the call, “physician, heal thy-
self,” it becomes a faculty-wide
responsibility to see that accounta-
bility is returned to the school of
medicine.

The Pitt News, Monday December 6, 1982

Spikers

Without question, this was no
ordinary volleyball game for the
Lady Panthers. Looking back on
an otherwise successful season will
reveal the telling tale.

From the start—the Cleveland
State Invitational back in
September—through the Big East
tournament, Coach Shelton Colli-
er’s.squad had been riddled.with
injuries. Torn ligaments and
sprained ankles became common-
place.

Practice sessions for regular sea-
son matches were conducted with
an air of electricity about them.
Still, those recurring injuries
popped up. No matter. The Lady
Panthers established long winning
streaks and compiled a very
impressive 35-6 match record
before going undefeated in the Big
Easts.

Then came the NCAA regionals.
Training sessions were stepped up
in intensity so much that sparks

Over-Matched

were flying and a certain fire
emerged from the player’s tenacity.

These were players that repres-
ented a healthy team and one that
was about to face one tidal wave of
a volleyball team. The opponent
was Cal Poly—San Luis Obisp0—a
squad from California that produ-
ces wins with assembly line effi-
ciency. Pitt was Cal Poly’s most
recent victim as the Lady Panthers
returned from California last night
knowing that not during the entire
season had they experienced such a
match of labor. ‘

Cal Poly easily dispatched Pitt
last Saturday evening 15-9, 15-2, 15-
5. The tidal wave submerged a not
so bouyant Pitt squad.

During the first game, the Lady
Panthers had perhaps their best
opportunity at going one game on
Cal Poly. The score reached 8-13
and Pitt was playing loose. That
was short-lived.

“We played right with them in
the first game,” Collier said. “At
13-8 we thought we had a good
chance, but we eventually got beat
the same way (Cal Poly) beat other

teams...USC, Texas and Pepper-
dine.”

Indeed, by venturing into North-
ern California this weekend, the
Lady Panthers were entering a red
zone of sorts. Not many teams
score wins over Cal Poly on the Cal
Poly court.

“They controlled the tempo of
the match,” Collier said. “For us to
be good, we have to know how to
play emotionally aggressive volley-
ball. We just couldn’t get
untracked against Cal Poly.”

Collier saw what was unfolding
before his eyes there were certain
tendencies that were absent from
the team’s play that had been pres-
ent in past matches.

“We are not an effective team,”
Collier said, “when we leave the
entire match up to the execution of
skills. Sure, we were intense and
ready to play, but there was no
mental toughness.

“It wasn't there because you hita
certain point in the game where

Jeff Jelic (left) took first place at the 167-lb weight class during the Penn State

Dinger photo

(mental toughness) enters into the
situation as a certain variable. If
we could have gotten untracked we
culd have started putting the
clamps on them.”

If a two-letter word that is always
a constant variable in the competi-
tive sports sector. The Lady Panth-
ers attempted to find their variable
by engagingin a “very intense wor-
by engaging in a “very intense
workout” prior to the Cal Poly
match.
Collier said “so we could get over
the jet lag and become acclimated
to Cal Poly’s very spacious game
floor.”

The preparation over an entire
season probably would not aid the
Lady Panthers. Sure, Collier did
acknowledge that his squad exhi-
bited very fine defensive skills and
even pointed out the effectiveness
of captain Julie Gaul’s setting.

“We did some good things,” he
said, “but Cal Poly did four or five
consecutive things.

“We took our shot at winning

In N CAA Tournament

that first game, but then they
started controlling us in the
second. And we reflected ot that in
our post-game meeting....We took
our best shot and reflected on that.
Winning and losing is one of the
factors, but being prepared is the
main thing.”

And so it goes. The Lady Panth-
ers really could not have put them-
selves in a better position. The
team was loose. The team knew
what to anticipate. It had nothing
to lose. Was it then only a formality
as match time approached—a
likely loss to Cal Poly?

That question cannot be ans-
wered by a squad of players that
had only the sky to reach for; a
squad that has won six of every
seven matches played in this
season.

The Lady Panthers knew they-
were headed for the match of‘ the
season, but that same season came
to an abrupt halt as they met the
toughest opponent they have faced
all season.

Jelic Pitt’s Champ In
Penn State Invitational

By TIM DINGER

Panther wrestler Jeff Jelic
emerged as Pitt’s only champion in
Penn State Invitation held over this
past weekend.

Jelic, who wrestled at 167 lbs.,
but ranked fourth nationally at 158
lbs., had a relatively easy time cap-
turing his championship.

In the first round, Jelic met Penn
State’s Paul Weigarter,beating him
7-1. In the second round, he faced
Eric Brugel of Penn State.

“It was an important match for
Jeff. It was the best match he's
wrestled so far this year,” assistant
coach Chuck Coryea said.

The last time Jelic and Brugel
met, Jelic won the Eastern Wres-

tling League Championship, beat-
ing Brugel, 5-2. This time, Jelic
defeated Brugel, ll-4

In the semifinals, Jelic sh'utout
John Salman of Rider 5-0 and in
the finals, it was Jelic over Tem-
p1e’s Mike DeGenora 11-4.

Another Panther who fared well
was Joe Throckmorton in the 134-
lb. class. Throckmorton went 3-1
for the tournament, taking third
place.

Throckmorton began the tour-
nament by beating George Sanchez
of Millersvi1l8-1 in the first round.
He went on the defeat Virginia’s

Players

By BARRY ZASLOFF

“Athletics are taken seriously
in most c0lleges...there is not
much fun or freedom in the life
of the candidate for the...team
...intense rivalry smothers the
spirit of fair play and leaves the
game short of one of its greatest
attractions....The money mak-
ing value of the game is drag-
ging sports down from its true
place as a recreation, and,
together with the rivalry before
alluded to, must tell against its
best interests....”—R. Tate
McKenzie (1893)

Imagine if McKenzie had
been raised in our present
society, where collegiate athlet-
ics take the form of corporate
enterprise. Picture his words if
he could glance at the millions
of dollars bandied about by the
bowl committees, the lucrative
television packages offered by
various networks, the schools "
that pay a coach more than its
professors and the many cases of
recruiting violations which
threaten to turn college sports
into a new edition of the Perry

Mason television series.

At one time, perhaps only
during their inception, college
sports were innocent forms of
recreation for bored students.
Now, they have turned into big
businesses, with the individuals
who people the games serving
as employees.

For what they bring to a
university-—particularly foot-
ball and basketball players-
they are practically paid slave
wages. Tuition? Housing? An
education? Pitt will deposit a
check for $2 million when it
arrives home from Texas and its
date to meet Southern Metho-
dist in the Cotton Bowl.

What do the athletes get?
Some receive a diploma, and
later, a job, which without a
college education, might not
otherwise be possible. Some
advance to the professional
ranks and sign contracts that
would do a mafia hitman
proud.

Sadly, there is another cate-
gory that student-athletes fall
into: individuals who never
graduate, never reach the dream
contract and never take advan-
tage of the opportunities that

stand before them.

For each Hugh Green, for
each Julius Erving, there are ‘
hundreds of athletes who play
four years of collegiate sports,
then are never heard from
again. Some have more ability,
more natural talent than their
counterparts who will make a
professional team. For one rea-
son or another, they never reach
the Promised Land.

Examples have been strewn
across Pitt athletics over recent
years. Some argued that Elliot
Walker, who played in the same
backfield as Tony Dorsett,
might someday make a better
football player than Dorsett,
who is currently starring with
the Dallas Cowboys. Finding
Walker would be a difficultcase
for even the FBI to solve.

Rick Asberry came to Pittas a
heralded high school running
back. In fact, he was labelled the
next Tony Dorsett. A sure bet he
was labelled. After seeing
limited action for two years,
Asberry quit football and
joined the ‘track team. His
potential went unquestioned.
His dedication and desire to

play the game were filled with
one question mark after
another.

For many athletes in a big
business setting, college sports
build the hopes of gifted indi-
viduals, before bringing them
down in something resembling
a runaway elevator.

The falls, however, are not
limited to football and basket-
ball players. Take, for example,
Pitt's recent decision to cancel
its men’s volleyball and
women's field hockey pro-
grams. Athletic Director Ed
Bozik, facing a $25,000 budget
cut, said that volleyball and
field hockey were (Ill because
neither had scholarships or
commitments to the student-
athletes.

Still, the athletes demon-
strated the kind of reactions that
put the entire scene in the
proper perspective. It was as if
they were steel workers who had
just been told that times are
tough and layoffs are manda-
tory. lt’s difficult for workers to
sympathize with United State
Steel bosses. Similarly, it’s

Athletes Must Face The Realities Associated With Big Business

rough for volleyball and field
hockey players to accept Bozik’s
decision.

“All I can see is the Cotton
Bowl," said volleyball player
Barry Goldberg after he learned
of the news.

Mike Keating, a freshman
who turned down a scholarship
to play volleyball at Pitt, was
one of the athletes who came
rocketing back to Earth.

“I am very disappointed,” he
said. “I’m upset because I
turned down that offer to play
here, and now, they cut the pro-
gram. I didn’t even know that
this was going to happen.”

A simple case of a business

I facing budgetary cuts, with the

employees, who in this case
receive no pay, being the
victims.

“I'm just here to have fun,”
Goldberg said. “Then they go
and cut the program. I’m sure
there is some way that Bozik can
keep the program."

In the distance, Westing-
house Airbrake employees can
be heard uttering similar

Soviet Gymnasts
Armed With Talent

By BRIAN BALK

The Soviet Union and the Uni-
ted States have had their differences
in the past. Every year new tensions
seem to mount while the iron cur-
tain draws thicker and thicker.
Tonight, however, not a word will
be spoken of nuclear disarmament,
espionage or martial law when the
Soviets visit Fitzgerald Field
House.

Politics will be substituted by
high competition as the National
Soviet team faces the Panther Gym-
nastics team tonight at 7:30. This
international competition prom-
ises to be one of the finest show-
cases of topcaliber gymnastics in
the land.

Coach Frank D’Amico admits
that this meet will be a definite
mismatch.

“The best all-around on their
team can beat the best all-around in
our whole country,” he said.

D’Amico said this Soviet team is
the best team in the world due to
several factors.

“First of all, you have .to
remember that their team members
range anywhere from 18 to 28,”
D’Amico said. Men’s gymnastics is
a sport where physical maturity is a
necessary criterion.

“The whole structure is differ-
ent. This university selects 150 of
the best gymnasts in their country
and makes them work out 7 to 8
hours a day,” said D’Amico.

Another element attributing to
the Soviet excellence is the harsh
discipline they administer.

“Their training is built around
‘scoring and pain," he said. “Small
injuries are nothing to them—they
are severely scolded if they don’t
work out.”

The Soviet National team’s first
stop in the American tour was last
week at Northern Illinois. They
had little trouble defeating North-
ern Illinois, 285.3 to 276.4. The
Soviets were lead by Valentin
Nogiliny, who scored a 57.15 in the
all-around. ‘

D’Amico’s expectations are as
high as ever for this international
meet.

Dave Smith

“I hope to break every Pitt
record,” he said. “If we just had a
bit more time to develop routines
and had a chance to experiment
with sets and combinations—I‘nr
sure we would do it.”

The Panthers, though not as
primed for the Olympic competi-
tion as the Soviets, are ready for the
challenge. This week's workouts
have been focused upon routines
and cleanliness. And although the
Panthers do not expect to .win

tonight, the meet will prepare
them for the Farmingdale Open in
two weeks.

Juniors Dave Smith and Frank
Kratz will be the two all-around
contenders for the Panthers. Smith,
a strong tumbler and vaulter, is a
newcomer to the all-around, while
Kratz excels in the parallel bars and
high bar.

D’Amico is also utilizing the top
crop of the freshmen he recruited.
Mark Klafter, Mat Peters and Kevin
Garren will be competing for the
first time at Fitzgerald Field House.

D’Amico said that this squad can
be one of the best in Pitt’s history
because of its depth.

“You measure’ depth from your
first guy up to your last,” D’Amico
said. “This year we will have a
team where the scores will only
vary in tenths instead of entire
points from first to last.”

“We have the capability to score
9.5 on every event but we just
haven't done it yet," said D’Amico
of the team’s potential.

The meet is free to all students
with a validated ID.

D’Amico also commented onthe
caliber of the Soviet squad-—
“When you get to the level they are

at, it is iust supreme artistry.”

President Reagan may be think-
ing of new methods of controlling
the two countries’ arms race, the
CIA may be plotting new ways of
infiltrating the KGB, but tonight
at the Field House all USA-USSR
political differences will be absent.
All that will be present are two fine
gymnastics teams competing in
one of the most exciting Pitt meets
ever.

Long Season Ends For Spikers

By MARK SINDLER

Pitt volleyball coach Shelton
Collier will not admit it, but all
things considered, he has just
wrapped up the most successful
volleyball season ever at Pitt. The
“things” are important facets of a
42-7 year. Successful? That
depends on whether making pro-
gress and overcoming obstacles are
considered significant.

Venture back, not too long ago,
when the leaves on the trees were
still evidently green. The time: late
August when days of blistering
heat were still present. The Pirates
were even still in the running for
the Eastern Division title.

This was also the time when Col-
lier was assembling ajigsaw puzzle
of players. There were girls from
Canada, Puerto Rico, Florida and
Ohio. The local talent was abund-
ant, too.

Collier had just three returning
seniors on a nine-player roster that
revealed no juniors, three sopho-
mores and three freshmen. Could it
be done, Collier probably thought.
Can this team reach that .500
pinnacle?

In the short span of three weeks,
Collier knew that his team had
some unique chemistry. Through
the West Virginia Invitational,
Oct. 3, the Lady Panthers had
racked up four straight tourna-
ment championships.

The squad was doing something
right because its record at this
point was at 21-2, with Loyola and
Georgetown being the only blem-
ishes. A couple noteworthy events
took place during the September
months.

Middle hitter Ulana Kohutiak, a
viable spark plug in the Collier
machine, started a two month reha-
bilitation tenure after suffering
debilitating ligament injuries in
the Duquesne tri-match. During

. that same period, the Lady Panth-

ers also defeated nationally known
teams from Tennessee and Ohio
State.

And, not to be forgotten at any
costs, is the defeat avenged the three
losses the Lady Lions inflicted
upon Pitt last season.

Time kept rolling along as Pitt
hiked its record to 29-4, losing bad-
break matches to Louisville and
Cleveland State. In the same span,
though, the Lady Panthers
scorched the Lady Lions again and
scored two more tournament
wins—at its own Pitt Invitational
and at the Kent State Classic.

Lady Luck continually sided
with Pitt as the team prepared fora
hastily called Big East showdown
at Villanova. Pitt avenged an ear-
her loss to Georgetown by deci-
sively beating the Hoyas in a best of
five game match.

Already, the Lady Panthers had
been playing some of their matches
short of the minimum number
required to start and required to
avoid forfeit. Those were chal-
lenges to face up to. Challenges?
Those were nothing compared to
what ensued.

Pitt was now to travel down
South to face a rematch with Ten-
nesse, tops in the SEC. Again, Col-
lier struck oil and scored big,
except that Tennessee provided the
only dry spell as the Lady Vols
trounced Pitt big. There were,
though, two games against Ten-
nessee that went into overtime and
could have, Collier later said, gone
either way.

OK, so the Lady Panthers were
now the team to beat in the East as
their trivial five losses would attest
to. Only a match in University
Park stood in the way of the Big
East championships in which Pitt
was seeded first.

A 35-5 team suffered its sixth loss
on Nov. 3 when Penn State sal-
vaged a poor seasonal showing

against their intra-state rivals. So

Pitt did beat Penn State 2-1 in the
match series. After an 0-3 season
against the same, that doesn’t fare
too badly since the Lady Lions
were ranked 13th at season’s start.

Now came the Big East tourna-
ment in Providence, and the only
thing the Lady Panthers accomp-
lished was a perfect 5-0 showing,
including a clean sweep of Big East
rival Georgetown in the finals. Pitt
was headed for the NCAA regional
semifinals.

Who would have thought? Pitt?
In the NCAASP After a jigsaw puz-
zle of a team two and one half
months back? It was not possible,
at least not to any knowledgeable
person in volleyball circles.

Those are the facts. The odds
were against the Lady Panthers all
season long. The odds were sur-
mounted as Pitt compiled a 19-
game winning streak during the
year and-even reached as high as
17th in the NCAA national
rankings.

OK, so the team did pretty well
this year. But what are the reasons
behind this success story of 1982?
What is there now that was not
there in the team when the season
began?

The answers are difficult to find.
Collier has now stressed for three
months the mental toughness that
the team would require to win
along the way and beat every oppo-
nent faced.

Then there are the players, sort‘?
of whom live as much  2,500
miles from each other. Collier
counted on and got production
from two prize recruits, Sally Gil-
lespie and Carmen Tapia.

Gillespie hailed from Norwin, a
powerhouse itself, as its seven
straight state championships indi-
cate. During the pressure situa-
tions, she provided the flare and

 Pitt Quarterback Marino: No JekylI- Hyde Imitation

Get him away from the hype of
the media, the excitement of the
game and dress him not in his blue
and gold uniform, but blue jeans
and a T-shirt. Talk with him as he
skillfully balances crackers on his
left thigh, eating soup from George
Aikens and sitting on a low, com-
fortable couch in the athletic
lounge at Pitt Stadium. And meet,

realize that the two are very much
the same. Marino off the field-
there's no Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
act there. That is because Marino
the football player and Marino the

play football.

“To come to school at Pitt and

back, and Heisman candidate,
maintaining a balanced perspec-
tive can be quite an achievement.
But, Marino, in a soft voice with a
strong undercurrent of self confi-
dence believes that he has.

“I'm a pretty easy going guy,”
Marino said. “I like to joke around
and have fun. I’m not a serious per-
son, but when it’s time to be serious
then I am,” Marino said. Occasion-
ally, I do have to be diplomatic and
can't always say exactly what's on
my mind. But basically I stay the
same and maintain a good
perspective.”

Like any other college senior, he
reflects on his past four years and
looks ahead to graduation and new
beginnings, simultaneously
expressing an anxious dream to
move on and a sincere desire for
things to remain the same for at
least a little while longer.

“I’ve had four good years at Pitt
and I'll miss it when I'm gone,"
Marino said. “In some ways I want
to change. I'm looking forward to
playing in the NFL, bttt college is a
good time. There’s nota lotofpres-
sure on you to do things. The only
thing you have to worry about is
going to school and getting that
work done. Playing football is the
fun part."

The overall experience of col-
lege, meeting new people and mak-
ing friends, and the good times
shared, particularly among his
teammates, will be what Marino
remembers most.

“I didn’t. get to know many stu-
dents well, but those that I did, we
got along great, and there are some
people I’ll know for the rest of my
life. I was able to get to know some
of my professors, too."

As a communications major,
Marino said he sees a possible
career in that field when he is no
longer in football. He was recently
enrolled in a class that took him to
the Hill district to work with chil-
dren in physical education. Careers

By CHARLIE O'HARA

The Pitt Panther track team
opened the 1982-83 indoor season
with some very impressive perfor-
mances at the West Virginia Invita-
tional Saturday.

Following the competition,
Coach john Vasvary said, “Coach
(Steve) Lewis and myself were very
pleased with the effort by everyone.
They achieved far above what we
had expected.

“We still have a way to go but we
couldn’t have asked for more this
early in the season."

The Panthers finished with four
first places, including the West Vir-
ginia field house record for the 2-
mile relay. Garland Brown, Terry
Gallagher, Todd (Iolas and Darrin
Geary combined for the new record
time of 7:33.71}.

Todd Colas also won the 1,500-
meter run that found him trailing
by 30-40 yards entering the final
lap, but he put in a kick, giving
himself the win with a time of
3:52.95. Garland Brown was third
with a time of 4:02.18.

Terry Gallagher won the 800-
meter run in 1:53.99 while team-
mate Dee Baynes was third in
l:57.06. The other Panther winner
was Bill Moorehead, who finished
with a time of 8:24.46 in the 3,000-
rneter run.

Darryl Shepherd, the sophomore
transfer from Duquesne, made his
presence felt for the first time as a
Panther in the 55—meter hurdles.
He placed second with a time of
7:76, getting nipped at the wire by
.01 of a second.

Mario Joyner could syrnpathi‘/.e
with ' Shepherd because he was
squeezed out by the same margin in
the .300-meters run, finishing
second with a time of 1:05.22.

The mile relay team of Joyner,
Brian Pollock, Rich Baderinwa
and Rod Chobany also placed
second with a time of 3:22.32.

In the .‘%00—meter run. Baderinwa
placed second (35.33), while Pol-
lock was third (313.62).

In the l,000—meter run, Darren
Geary sat out because ofdifficulties
that occured in the 2—mile relay but
.\Iicl<ey Rihtarchik ran a 2:35.05
which earned him a second place
finish.

Rich Asbury and Baderinwa
were fourth (6.55) and fifth (6.57),
respectively, in the .3:3—1neter dash,
while Chobany was fifth in the -100-
meter run with a time of 52.6].

Overall, it was a solid perfor-
mance. The 2—mile relzr/V team.
which a year ago was one of six
teams in the country to l)r‘t*;tk the
I\'.(}.;\.;\. record, jumped right
back into the linielight and
appears to qualify this year.
Though the competition wasirt
difficult the Panthers turned in
some very respectable times. Tliis
determination leads one to l)elie\e
that when the competition steps
up. so will the Pantlters.

glitter the team would need to
regroup. Unbelievably, though,
she provided the punch despite her

Where Gillespie was short,
Tapia at 5-11 filled in as the
squad’s tallest, a middle hitter.
Tapia was often seen leaving the
floor and utilizing a vertical jump,
that allowed her to fully extend her
right arm over the top of the net.

When Tapia touched the ball, all
that was left was a whizzing blur
that easily eluded the opposing
backcourt specialists.

Tapia's accomplishments,

Oh, those outside hitters. Senior

Young returned from a starting
role last year and continued her
solid outside hitting, despite suf-

Kohtiak, the middle hitter out
for two months returned to the
lineup just in time for the Big Easts
and recovered from her ligament
injuries so quickly that she earned
a spot on the Big East All-
Tournament Team. Just one Inore
miracle.

Looking Forward To Competing

By MICHAEL EMERY

Coming off last season's Eastern
8 championship, one would expect
excitement in the Pitt Panther bas-
ketball program this year. But the
magnitude of Pitt’s move to the Big
East Conference makes last year’s
accomplishments seem transient.

None of the Panthers have come
to appreciate the move to the Big
East as much as Steve Beatty.

“It'll be an adjustment year for
us, but in the long run, it’ll really
be beneficial,” said the 6-9 junior
center-forward.

Beatty should know because he
has already had the opportunity to
realize the advantages of joining
the Big East. While most analysts
predict Pitt will take a step back-
wards before reaping benefits,
Beatty has already profitted from

I Pitt’s new alliance in the league-

even before the first jump ball of
the season.

This past summer, Beatty was
chosen to represent Pitt on a Big

East team that traveled to Angola
for a seven game tournament with
teams from Angola and Senegal.

The trip, which was initiated
and developed by the Phelps-
Stokes Fund and St. John’s Univer-
sity, lasted from July 24 to August
9. It was significant because it
marked the first such contact
between the United States and
Angola, a war-torn, former Portu-
guese colony on Africa's southwest
coast.

The United States does not
maintain diplomatic relations
with the Cuban-backed Angolan
government, but the basketball
tour enhanced recent talks between
the two countries to ease tensions.

“We were the first Americans
allowed in the country besides
those who work on the Gulf Oil
rigs,” Beatty said, “but they can’t
go off the compound where the oil
rigs are. ’

The team toured four Angolan
cities, including the capital in
Luanda, site of the tournament

that the Big East team won with a
7-0 record. Two exhibition games
were then played in the cities of
Cabinda and Lubango. The teams
and_ coaches also gave a series of
clinics for aspiring Angolan play-
ers. Afinal visit was made to a land-
mark in Mocamedes.

Beatty said he felt the response
from the Angolan people was
positive.

“The games in Luanda were
played in a nice arena,” he said.
“We averaged about 15,000 people
a game there.”

In return for the Angolans' hos-
pitality, the Americans gave the
Angolan and Sengalese teams
shirts and chewing gum as a cul-
tural exchange.

“They really liked the gifts,”
Beatty said. “They’d always point
for more gum, and they wore the
shirts several days in a row.”

It was the initial stop, a week stay
in Luanda, that the contrast
between American and Angolan
life became immediately evident.

“All my life, I took things for
granted," Beatty said. “You can say
you know about Third World
countries and how bad it is, but
until you experience it you don’t.
You can’t appreciate the full effect
until you go to a country like
Angola and actually see and expe-
rience how bad they have it.

“There were kids you see in pic-
tures with bloated stomachs. There
were flies in the eyes and mouths of
some kids. But this was real life.”

Beatty prized much of the teams
one day stay in the oil rigged city of
Cabinda, an enclave separated
from the rest of the country by the
short Atlantic coast of Zaire and
which borders the Congo republic.

“It was only for one day,” Beatty
said, “but we finally got to eatgood
food on the American compound
and just seeing some Americans
lifted our spirits."

“It really opened my eyes,”
Beatty said of his stay in Cabinda.
“The thing is the country has so

. much potential. It takes in so much

Following the exhibition games
in Cabinda and Lubango the team
took a final tour to Mocamedes for
a sightseeing expedition.

“We traveled down a winding
mountain road like the ones you
see in movies,” Beatty said. “When
we started out at the top of the
mountain we were above the
clouds . . . It took an hour anda half
to get to the bottom.”

So the trip was rewarding in
many ways for the Americans.
Alongwith the tournament cham-
pionship, the Big East team
returned to the United States with
memories of Angola and Angolan
life.

“It’s something I’ll always cher-

ish,” Beatty said. “It’s something
to tell the grandkids.”

Bailey Captured by
Bandits...

Sometimes, an offer is too good
to pass up. Defensive coordinator
Charlie Bailey has been named to a
similar position with the Tampa
Bay Bandits of the United States
Football League.

Before coming to Pitt this year,
Bailey served as defensive coordi-
nator for the University of Tampa,
Miami, Rice and Kentucky.

No.13 retired . . ..

In a dinner honoring the 1982
Pitt football team, Athletic Direc-
tor Ed Bozik announced that Dan
Marino’s number will be retired
after the l98.‘% Cotton Bowl. He will
join Tony Dorsett (33) and Hugh
Green (99) as Panthers receiving
this honor.

During his career, Marino set 13
all-time school records, including
total yards passing in a career and
total career offensive yards along
with first team All-America honors
and a fourth place finish in the
Heisman Trophy in l98l.

The Panthers are 42-5 with
Marino as quarterback and has
received four bowl bids and four
top ten finishes.

Game chartged....

The Pitt-Robert Morris basket-
ball game, schedule for Saturday
Dec. 11, has been moved to Friday,
Dec. l0. Game time is set for 8 p.m.

The reasoning behind moving
the game was that the Georgetown-
Virginia game was scheduled for
the same night on national televi-
sion. The game, which features
centers Patrick Ewing and Ralph
Sampson, is being carried locally
by WTAE-TV’.

Panther fans can watch this
game without -missing an upcom-
ing local rivalry, according to
Athletic Director Ed Bo/,ik,

had sortie good swims and some
average swims. Our depth wasn't
what theirs was, and a relay meet is
usually won by depth."

.\~IcCrillis swam his fastest
unshaved l00—yard split in Pitt’s
400-yard free relay. .\IcCrillis looks
forward with anticipation to the
upcoming season.

“We didn't do quite the time I
wanted," Lewis said about the 400-
yard medley relay, "but our
unshaved relay beat WVI7's shaved
team. They had to reorganize their
lineups for the next day when they
saw that loss. Ed Bahen pulled it
out perfectly for us to beat their
anchorman."

Lewis admits depth hurt. but he
also admitted that Pitt is a bit weak
in general in the butterfly and indi-
vidual medley events with only one
or two who swim them. Pitt is one
of the best in the East in backstroke,
breaststroke and freestyle. With
this in mind. Pitt should come out
ahead in the individual events. but
what will happen to the relays?

At a regular dual meet, only the
medley and free relays are swam.
Lewis expects to send both of these
relays to Nationals again this year,
so even if Pitt comes out behind in
the individual events of the dual
meets, their relays should lend an
advantage. Pitt's medley relay leads

Many thought the Pitt Panther
basketball team would be able to
win at least one game at the
Amana-Hawkeye Classic last
weekend. If Pitt lost the first round,
the Naval Academy would be easy
pickings in the consolation game.

This wasn‘t so, as the Panthers
finished last in the tournament los-
ing to Hawaii in the first round
70-67 and Navy the next night 73-
65. The defeats were bad enough,
but the way Pitt lost made the trip
to Iowa City even worse.

The Panthers were able to take a
20-10 lead early in the game.
Hawaii then applied a press, and

the half.

halftime. Navy guard David
Brooks did most of the damage,
scoring 19 of his 25 points in the
second half.

Vaughan again led the Panthers
with 19 points, but he only scored
five in the second half. In general,
thejunior forward was taken out of
the flow of the Pitt offense, even
though he was in double figures for
both games. Freshman guard Jowy
David, in his first collegiate start,
scored 12 points against the
Middies.

Going into Tuesday’s game at
Eastern Michigan, head coach Roy
Chipman must find ways to plug
the weakness imposed this past
weekend. Or else, the Panthers are
in for a long season.

Player

prowl alone, one of the things he
enjoys most is playing his stereo.

“I like music, all kinds of music.
I particularly like rock, and lately,
I’ve started listening to jazz,” he
said.

If Marino, whose number will be
retired after the Cotton Bowl, has
any outgoing remark, this is it:
“When you're well known, some
people like you, some don’t. When
things go well, everybody is on
your side; when they don’t go so
well you really find out who your
friends are. If people treated others
the way they would like to be
treated, it would solve a lot of prob-
lems. People should have respect
for one another.”

An easy solution from an easy

going guy.

pion Bill Marino of Penn State, 7-0
in overtime.

“Joe had Marino on the ropes
the whole match,” Coryea said.
“He stayed with him and could
have won the match.”

In the consolation finals,
Throckmorton defeated Mary-
land’s Mark Dugan 13-4.

“We were very pleased with ]oe’s
performance. He’s staying right
with some of the best guys in the

. country,” Coryea said.

Senior Kurt Karanovich also
went 3-1 at the l90—lb weight class,
scoring a big pin over Penn State’s
Jack Inserra.

At 118 pounds, freshman Kyle
Nellis went 2-1 in the tournament,
losing to former All—Anierica
Anthony Calderaro of Slippery
Rock ll-6.

At 126 lbs., Rich Esswein went
1-2 for the tournament, while at
142 lbs., senior john Settineri was
0-3.

At the 150-lbs. weight class,
freshman Joe Bond was 2-1 as were
Doug Haines at 158 lbs. and Frank
Rich at 177 lbs. At heavyweight,
Pitt’s Dan Kasperkowski finished
1-2.

“We’re not satisfied, but we’re
happy at this point. This was the
best we've done since we started
coaching here,” Coryea said. “We
did well in the first round, but the
second round killed us. We’ve got
to get more consistent at
tournaments."

“Our individuals are coming
through for us now. Our expe-
rience is starting to show, and other
teams are starting to worry about
us.”

The Panthers will now take the
rest of December off to prepare for
the regular season coniitig up in
January. Some of Pitt’s grapplers
will participate in tournaments
over Christmas break. Head coach
Rande Stottlemeyer has applied to
get several of his wrestlers in the
Midlands Invitational wrestling
tournament held at Norhwestern.

The Midlands tournament‘
accepts applicants based on pre-
vious achievements. Thus, only the
best in the country will be partici-
pating. Expected to wrestle for Pitt
in the tournament are jelic,
Throckmorton and Haines.

The Panthers’ first home match
will be on Jan. 6 against Young-
stown State University.

Panthers Stung By Bearcats

Cold shooting, little rebounding
and turnovers were the downfall of
the Pitt Lady Panther basketball
team as it suffered the first loss of
the season to Cincinnati 85-59 in
the finals of the Pitt-Adidas Classic
at the Fitzgerald Field House
yesterday.

The Lady Bearcats scored ten
consecutive points at the outset of
the game before freshman Kim Tir-
ik's 20-foot jumper at the 15:25
mark of the first half broke the ice
for the Lady Panthers;

Cincinnati’s quickness at the
guard position hurt the Lady
Panthers as Lady Bearcats Cheryl
Cook and Donna Jennings com-
bined for 23 of 49 points in the first
half——two more points than the
entire Pitt squad.

The statistics showed Cincinna-
i’s domination. The Lady Bearcats

shot 51 percent from the floor
while Pitt shot for 27 percent. The
Lady Panthers had problems on
the foul line. shooting 7 for 12. Pitt
was outrebounded 25-13 and threw
away the ball 15 times.

Pitt and Cincinnati each scored
38 points in the second half, but the
Lady Bearcats refused to let the
Lady Panthers get any closer,
shooting 72 percent from the floor
in the second half. Although the
Lady Panthers were perfect from
the foul line and shot 60 percent
from the field, the outcome of the
game was well in hand.

Forwards Jennifer Bruce and
Pam Miklasevich led the Lady
Panther attack with 10 points each.

.Vliklasevich only scored two poitits .

in the first half, while Bruce was
unable to score in the second half.
Cook was one of six Lady Bear-

cats in double figures with 17
points while forward Stacia Kissel
added It}.

In the first round Saturday
night, Pitt defeated Akron 72-63.
The Lady Panthers opened a ten
point lead in the first half and
coasted to their fourth win.

Bruce again led Pitt’s attack with
25 points and 9 rebounds. Miklase-
yich added 12 points.

Akron took third place in the
tournament, routing Carlow Col-
lege 101 -26. Carlow had earlier lost
to Cincinnati in the first round
101-24.

The Lady Panthers will return to
action Wednesday night as Pitt
hosts St. John’s at the Fitzgerald
Field House. Game time is set for
7:30 p.m.

Why College Athletics Aren't Big Business

By BRIAN BALK

(Editor’s Note.‘ Th is is thefirst of
a one-part series on ui/zy college
athletics are not a big business.)

Sports Column

A poor high school senior,
unable to ever afford higher educa-
tion, was spotted pulverizing tail-
backs at his triple-A high school
deep in the Appalachian Woun-
tains. The college scout noticed the
potential in this 6-2, 235 lb. defen-
sive end and offered him a full ride
scholarship to State. After a suc-

cessful football career in college,
this country boy went on to earn a
medical degree and brought his
family out of poverty.

Sounds like a fairy tale or some-
thing out of a child‘s bedtime book.

It may seem like fantasy, but sto-
ries such as this are true——-look at
the athlete who just captured the
Heisman Saturday for example. If
it were not for the money in colle-
giate athletics, stories such as this
would indeed be fables only.

College athletics is a business.
But it is a business only to the
extent of giving strident-athletes a

viable competitive environment.

Money is evident in every faction
iti our society today—from zoos to
convents. It is onl_v natural that col-
legiate athletics should get caught
in dollars and cents entanglements;
it is inevitable. But no matter how
much money is pumped into insti-
tutions for sports, the colleges
still—and will continueto—— pro-
duce athletes on an amateur level.

Now there is no denying that
some colleges do go overboard in
stretching this amateur status-
such as, the donating of an extra
280 ZX to a top—caliber recruit.
However, on the whole, colleges

support and practice the statues
that the .'\'(l.-\.\ is built upon.

If college athletics was such a
“big" business. then why are so
many students involved in rioti-
revenue sports? How many field
hockey players or swimmers have
tnade it big in professional tanks?

There are still some athletes that
consider collegiate competition
more than a stopping station
enroute to big bucks in the pro
ranks.

Lets face it, sports have become a
portion of almost everyone’s lives
in one way or another. Athletics,
amateur or professional, are in the

spotlight daily and have an
extraordinary impact.

The media needs more controv-
ersy than who beat who and by how

much. Thus. they focus on what
goes behind the scenes. Matty times
the media’s vision becomes blurred
and distorted—the result is sensa-
tionalized accusations of collegiate
corruption.

So the next time you read about
the alleged big bucks and corrup-
tion in collegiate athletics, just
think abut those fairy tales that are
transformed into true life docu-
mentaries thanks to the money in
college athletics.
