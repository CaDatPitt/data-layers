Cuts in Medicare, Medicaid
result in 250 UPMC layoffs

By Jack Finn
Asst. News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center announced layoffs
of 250 workers effective June 30.

The layoffs are due to con-
straints on the operating budget
caused by planned reductions in
Medicare, Medicaid and other
[h1rd—p;irty payer payments, UMPC
Director of Health Science News
Bureau Jane Duffield said.

The continuing trend towards
ambulatory care was also cited for
anticipated loss of millions of dol-
lars in revenue in the fiscal year
1993-94.

“Less than 5 percent of the lay-
offs are in direct patient care, so
there will be no reduction of
patient service,” Duffield said.

The balance of the layoffs are in
managers (17 percent) and admin-
istration (20 percent), with the rest
coming from support services,
according to Duffield.

Additionally, 250 positions not
currently filled will be eliminated.

“UMPC anticipates savings of $7
million for fiscal year 1993-1994
with the layoffs and other cut-
backs,“ Duffield said.

Those laid off will be offered
two weeks severance pay per year
of service. ‘

The staff will have the option of
continuing their medical and den-
tal coverage through the end of
the severance period by paying
current rates.

Staff who lose their jobs are
being offered job—search assis-
tance and counseling and may be
considered internal job candidates
through the end of the year.

In an effort to become more
competitive with area hospitals in
primary patient care, UMPC is
planning to open satellite care
centers in the area, according to
Duffield.

No date has been set for this
program to begin.

Council endorses
GPSA fee increase

Byjulie Sabol
Editor in Chief

The University Senate Council
endorsed the student activities
fee increase that the Graduate
and Professional Student
Association has been working
to implement since late last
year.

GPSA President Steve Parks
said the endorsement was posi-
tive, but the final decision rests
with Pitt Chancellor _]. Dennis
O’Connor.

“I expect O’Connor will also
agree with the fee — he has no
reason not to,” Parks said.

The endorsement for a $3
increase was given during
Monday’s Senate Council meet-
ing and raises the graduate stu-
dent activities fee to $10.

The fee increase will allow
GPSA to maintain a full office
staff, continue with its newslet-
ter, offer free legal advice and
provide research and travel
funds to assist graduate and
professional students in their
professional development,
according to Parks.

“There are proven needs for
all of these services. We aren’t
experimenting with anything,”
Parks said.

Student Government
President Jacob Brody said he
understood GPSA needing a fee
increase but could not see why
it felt the need was urgent.

“What’s the do-or-die situa-

tion right now — whats needed
now?” Brody said.

But Parks said that the recent
endorsement shows a commit-
ment to graduate students at Pitt
and since the previous Senate
Council meeting he has
received many calls from the
university community offering
support and advice.

The Council also discussed
the university’s future operating
budget.

Building and renovation plans
would add 529 million to Pitts
annual operating budget, but
the figure is misleading, Senate
Council President James
Holland said.

Some of the costs would be
self-liquidating and would not
have an impact on the operating
budget —— mainly the conven-
tion center and parking mandat-
ed by the jump start projects,
according to Holland.

“This lowered our estimated
annual impact on the operating
budget to a mere $16 million,
which is still a lot of money.
Depending on how that is cut
and sliced  the $16 million
might be argued as something
else,” Holland said.

“No matter what the final fig-
ure, the impact will be very siz-
able on the operating budget
from our surge in building and
building renovations and it’s not
at a time when any of the rev-
enue sources seem likely to

Pitt considers response to T OCC

By Jack Finn
Asst. News Editor

Pitt faces a perplexing
situation in formulating a
response to The Oakland
Community‘ Coalition’s
request for immediate
action.

“We want to let the com-
munity know we are
deeply committed to face-
to-face discussions,” Senior
Vice Chancellor for busi-
ness and ﬁnance Ben T uchi
said. “But the tone {of the
demands] is surprisingly
strident.”

Eleven demands for
action were submitted to
Pitt officials by mail follow-
ing the May 26 meeting of
TOCC and require a written
response by June 21.

“We are not interested in
Pitt merely looking at these
demands or putting them

under advisement or con-
sideration,” TOCC member
Jonathan Robison said.
“We've heard this for the
last 20 years, and we want
positive action.”

‘The demands encompass
such topics as the building
of the proposed convoca-
tion center/basketball
arena, the defining of hard
boundaries for Pitt’s expan-
sion, opening of recre-
ational facilities and expan-
sion of the campus shuttle
service to Oakland and
Terrace Village residents,
and removal of off-campus
fraternities in violation of
Pittsburgh zoning ordi-
nances.

If the demands aren’t met
to its satisfaction,'TOCC
said they would consider
withdrawing from joint dis-
cussions with the university
and exerting pressure on

the state legislature to with-
hold fundingfrom Pitt,
according to Robison.

Pitt officials said they are
interested in hearing the
residents’ views.

A response is being pre-
pared by the university,
according to Director of
Commonwealth Relations
Dennis McManus. “We are
trying to balance the needs
of the university with those
of the community,” he said.

“We’ve added eight new
intercollegiate sports pro-
grams without the benefit
of new facilities,” McManus
said. “There has been no
updating of {sports} facili-
ties since the

ted to going forward with

sition by TOCC, according

architectural society

By Dave Titmus
For The Pitt News

With his red suspenders and
colorful tie decorated with fast-
food designs, it seems unlikely
that anyone would guess
Franklin Toker is the newest
president of the Society of
Architectural Historians.

But that’s exactly what he is.
Toker, the society’s 28th presi-
dent, joked that the only criteria
for membership that he knows of

« 'is “a working telephone. They

called me in 1989 and asked if I
would like to become second
vice president. A short time after-
ward, the first vice president
stepped down and I assumed
that role.”

The Society of Architectural
Historians, enlisting over 5,000
architects and scholars through-
out the world, is recognized as
one of the principal organiza-
tions in the studies of architec-
ture.“By becoming the president
in no way means that I am the
greatest architectural historian in
the world, just the [spokesper-

son] for the world’s architectural
historians,” Toker said.

The society offers an outlet for
historians’ ideas by producing a
journal that publishes their arti-
cles, he said. “I hope to make the
journal 21 little more colorful and
include more photos,” Toker
said, as he flipped through a
copy.

The 49-year-old Toker, a
medieval archaeologist and art
historian at the University of
Pittsburgh, began his career in
Florence, Italy in 1966. Toker
was sent as part of an American
relief mission to restore the

works of art damaged by exten-

sive ﬂooding in Florence.

Toker continued working in
Florence with excavations in a
Florentine cathedral, the Duomo
of St. Maria del Fiore, from 1969
to 1974. He retumed in 1980 and
uncovered something that made
the Italian art community envi-
ous.~ The cathedral  the second
largest church in the world” and
is topped by an enormous dome
constructed by Filippo

Keep church and state separate

Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that school officials
cannot ban speeches from graduation ceremonies just
because religious references are included in the mes-
sage. This ruling comes amidst continuing controversy
surrounding the separation of church and state.

According to the L0sAngeles Times, “The high court
by a 9-0 vote declared that school officials may not
exclude a group or speaker from their grounds just
because they intend to offer a religious message. To do
so violates the church group’s free-speech rights.”

However, this decision came a day late for students at
Upper St. Clair High School. The American Civil
Liberties Union filed suit against the high school and an
agreement was made to keep religious material out of
the school’s graduation ceremony. Although several
valedictorians mentioned God in their original speeches
and the majority of the students voted to keep the reli-
gious references, the agreement remained intact.

“I don’t understand now why we couldn’t have had
[the original invocation]. The majority of seniors voted
to have it,” said Upper St. Clair graduate Kristin
Lesonick.

The separation of church and state is a fundamental
right. Freedom of speech isalso a fundamental right.
But guidelines have to be made when the two overlap.
The responsibility of this lies with the Supreme Court.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Justice Byron R.
White said, “the government violates the First
Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely
to suppress the point of view he espouses.” School
administrators, public officials, higher authorities and all
servants to the public should not violate the separation
of church and state. They are paid with our taxes and
elected with our votes; they are the state. And they are
not paid to give us their religious ideas. I

But the situation is different for students. According to
the L0sAngeles Times, Jay Sekulow, counsel for the
American Center for Law and Justice, said, “it gives [stu-
dents] the right to speak about God during graduation
ceremonies  The Supreme Court has clearly stated that
religious speech must not be censored from the market-
place of ideas.”

Students should have the right to express their reli-
gious ideas whenever given the opportunity. This free-
dom of speech should be shared by all individuals as
long as they are not representing the state in a public
institution. The Supreme Court’s recent decision should

‘distinguish between freedom of the individual and the

responsibility of the state.

But it should be kept in mind that although dominant
in this culture, Christianity is not the only existing reli-
gion. The Bill of Rights was established to protect
minority rights. If one student can make references to
God, another can refer to Buddha or Satan. And neither
of these students should be stopped.

In between Heaven and Hell

A week ago last Saturday, I was having lustful
thoughts, stuffing myself and even gambling a lit-
tle. Atlantic City proved to be a wonderful spot
for a Memorial Day getaway. A couple days later,
I was surrounded by thousands of people who
sought to find a way to get past these worldly
urges. I had gone from Sodom to salvation in the
space of a few days.

The Billy Graham Crusade had come to
Pittsburgh after being away for more than two
decades. America’s best-known, and possibly
most highly—regarded, Christian came to town to
preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Tens of thou-
sands heeded his call and came
ﬂocking to the city to see him
speak. The strange irony of it all
was that I was part of this

crowd.
As an avowed agnostic, I had

initially thought that whatever I
was going to hear and see
would only be useful as fodder for a few good
jokes about those who chose to follow someone
like the Reverend Graham. While I respected
Graham himself, the fundamentalist crowd that
he tends to attract is another matter. My friends
and I had joked about dressing as Hare Krishnas
or Satan worshippers for the event. We all had a
good laugh as we imagined the stir we could
cause. “What bumpkins!!” we thought. Without
even seeing or meeting a single person who was
going to attend the event, we had already passed
judgment on them. And we were sure that we
were better than them.

I arrived at Three Rivers Stadium at about 5:00
p.m. Although the crusade wasn’t scheduled to
begin for another few hours, I wanted to make
sure that I had a good seat. Two-and-a-half hours
and a very long wait in line later, I found myself
in a box seat behind left field. Therelwas no
going back now.

The event began with some hymns rendered
by a choir made up of local church members.
Afterward, a number of the event’s organizers
spoke brieﬂy on the event’s importance.
Essentially, they all said the same thing. Their

pretty good place-kicker.

After Mr. Anderson, I was treated to more
singing. And even more guest speakers. I half-
expected to see the Energizer Bunny come strut-
ting across the AstroTurf as these orators kept
going and going and going. I began to wonder if
coming to this event was such a good idea. Billy
Graham was nowhere to be seen and the sun
was starting to set. As the collection buckets were
distributed, I seriously considered leaving.
Fortunately, I decided to stay.

A little more than an hour after it began, the
crusade hit its stride with the actual appearance
of Billy Graham. My patience
was rewarded when he
launched into his sermon. He
spoke of the need for today’s
troubled youth to turn away
from a life of indulgence and
depravity. He urged them to
turn to Christ for their salvation
from a lifestyle that would ultimately destroy
them both physically and emotionally. He argued
in favor of people living a modest, disciplined
life.

I must say I was impressed. The sermon he
gave is one that I have heard dozens of times.
What was specialabout it this time was the deliv-
ery. The reverend’s understanding of human
nature was well-demonstrated.

Instead of a dose of heavy—handed moralizing,
he gave the audience something to be excited
about. “Govern your passions!” he said, and we
all smiled (myself included) because we felt as if
we were being shown a way to better ourselves.
Restraint was no longer seen as something
unpleasant but as something that would ultimate-
ly make us better, happier people. Escaping
damnation was no longer the issue. Salvation was
seen as something to strive for, not as means to
avoid everlasting torment, but as an end in and of
itself. My friends and I were fools to sneer at Billy
Graham and his crusade. Instead of bumpkins, I
saw people. Instead of mindless zealotry, I found
a group of people who wanted to become a pan
of something bigger than themselves. Instead of
having the Bible crammed down my throat, I

these people, it was just that I had come to see
the reverend himself.

A few minutes later, my spirits began to bright-
en. Gary Anderson, the Steeler’s place-kicker,
took the podium. I thought to myself, “Finally,
someone who has something interesting to say!”
But, I was sorely disappointed. Let me just say,

people were looking for the same thing we were;
the meaning of life. We actually thought we were

can’t open your mind. It’s an old lesson that
we’ve all heard before and that we’re all a little
sick of hearing. Maybe if we’d finally learn to take

The Man Who Lived
Underground

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer

The Man Who Lived
Underground
Written by Richard Wright
Directed by Marc Masterson

Performed by Don Marshall

In the midst of a sparse set in
the black—box studio space adja-
cent to City Theatre, the story of
a man wrongly punished for a
crime he didn’t commit unrav-
els. The stoiy is an all-too-famil-
iar one in our society today and
it is the basis for Richard
Wright’s The Man Who Lived
Underground.

Wright, one of the most pro-
lific African—American writers of
the twentieth century, graphi-
cally portrays what it means to
be black in America. Pitt profes-
sor and director and founder of
the Kuntu Reparatory Theatre,
Vernell Lillie, acts as dramaturg
on this production. It is a pro-
duction that examines the jus-
tice — or rather injustice —- sys-
tem in this country.

Fred Daniels is falsely
accused of murdering a white
woman. After enduring a severe
beating at thehhands of his inter-
rogators, he succumbs to ‘pres-
sure to sign a confession as a
final plea to stop the police bru-
tality.

Escaping, he has nowhere to
run from society but down-
wards into the city’s sewer sys-
tem. He manages to burrow
through the walls into base-
ments throughout the city, find-
ing shelter from the fast run-
ning, stench—laden filth.

While life underground is
anything but appealing, it is a
guaranteed safe haven from the
unfair society above. It is meant

covers access to unlimited cash
and jewels, then realizes they
are of no use to him under-
ground. They have no bearing
on the act of survival.

As Daniels, Don Marshall is a
nonstop one-man show. How
someone can have the
endurance to do two hours’
worth of monologue work is
beyond me, but Marshall does it
and he never loses an ounce of
emotional intensity. He draws
the audience into the bowels of
the earth so that we, too,
accompany him on his journey
through the sewer system and
his glimpses above the ground.

Retreating underground is

nothing new for African-
Americans seeking a better,
freer existence. The most obvi-
ous historical reference to this is
the underground railroad. But
Wright takes that experience
and puts it into a contemporary
everyday context. Written in the
early 40s, The Man Who Lived
Underground will unfortunately
never lose its relevancy as long
as false persecution and subse-
quent brutality exist in our cul-
ture. And with the Rodney King
incident just last summer,
progress just isn’t a happening
thing.
The Man Who Lived
Underground plays the City
Theatre until June 20. Call 431-
4900 for tickets.

The School For Wives

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer

The School For Wives
Written by Moliere
Translated by Richard Wilbur
Directed by Edward Gilbert

Moliere’s plays often deal
with a central character who

.~\\ 

manipulates the system for her
or his own benefit. This usually
turns comic because it often
backfires. Such is the case in
The School for Wives, currently
on stage at the Pittsburgh Public
Theatre.

The play centers around an
old bourgeois man named
Amolphe who has an obsessive,
unhealthy fear of being made a
fool of by a woman through the
act of adultery. He raises a
young girl Agnes, from the time
she is four years old, in a con-
vent overseeing every angle of
her education or lack of one.
The play opens when she is 18
and ready for marriage.
Amolphe thinks he has the mar-

hard Wright's e Man : Lived Uround, starring Don Marshall.

ket cornered on getting a
young, uneducated, submissive
wife, but through a series of
comical plot twists, young love
and innocence triumph over
deceptive calculations.

In the first act, Amolphe even
confides to a friend that he likes
his women stupid and frumpy
all the better so they won’t be
attractive to other men and
commit adultery. The power of
male jealousy is the driving
force of Arnolphe’s actions.

As Arnolphe, George
Morfogen has complete com-
mand of the audience. He is a
relentless fury running the show
from start to finish.

The set and costumes

  
  

designed by Mark Negin were
very period and particularly
effective. The set, which con-
sisted of a terracotta-colored
stucco tower with swinging
doors, resembled a giant cuck-
oo clock.

The costumes were a beauti-

ful study in seventeenth-century
fashion. Shades of amber and
forest green trimmed with black
braiding and white handmade
lace adorned the men while
Agnes’ innocence was accentu-
ated by a pale yellow chiffon
gown.
Moliere’s The School For
Wives runs through June 27 at
the Public Theatre. For tickets,

“Conduct Unbecoming: Lesbians
and Gays in the U.S. Military,
Vietnam to the Persian Gulf’

by Randy Shilts

St. Martin’s Press

On February 20, 1990, The Pitt News
ran an investigative story uncovering
discrimination in the University’s ROTC
program. To many, the thought of a
University-affiliated program violating
its non-discrimination policy seemed
unlikely, but it was true. Following the
same directives of the United States
Armed Forces, ROTC programs banned
gay and lesbian student participation.
From that moment, Pitt joined other
universities grappling with an anti-gay
ban and a commitment to fairness in
higher education.

ROTC debates and many others are
chronicled in journalist Randy Shilts’
recently released Conduct
Unbecoming: Lesbians and Gays tn the
U.S. Military, Vietnam to the Persian
Gulf Shilts carefully covers over two

decades of an anti-gay ban in its vari-
ous forms, weaving together a com-
pelling story of individuals struggling to
overcome the adversity of being gay or
lesbian in America

But adversity is not always offered to
lesbian or gay recruits.

For instance, Perry Watkins, a
Vietnam veteran, checked “yes” to the
question of homosexual tendencies on
his enlistment papers in 1967. When
asked, “Why did you do that.” Watkins
responded, “because it’s the truth.” Yet
despite an anti-gay ban, the psychiatrist
wrote “This nineteen-year-old inductee
has had homosexual tendencies in the
past  Patient can go in Military service
—— qualified for induction.” But, as
Shilts notes, this was during the
Vietnam era and hundreds of thou-
sands of Americans refused to partici-

 

pate. Inducting a gay man was tolerat-
ed, at least temporarily. It was only
after the war ended that Watkins was
discharged for his “yes” response.
Conduct Unbecoming rescues the
humor often lost with current debates
such as in the U.S. Senate hearings on
the anti-gay ban. Gays in the military
often chose code names to refer to
each other to escape investigation;
however, during one witch hunt, Naval
Investigative Services officers stumbled
onto something. “Friends of Dorothy”
was such a code used to describe other
gay men. Shilt explains, “This code
term had originated in the 19405 and
19505 and referred to Judy Garland’s
character in The Wizard of Oz. The
NIS, however, did not know the
phrases history and so believed that a
woman named Dorothy was the hub of

an enormous ring of military homosex-
uals in the Chicago Area. The NIS was
prepared to hunt Dorothy down and
convince her to give them the names of
homosexuals.”

Shilts’ rendering joins a growing list
of insightful work documenting the
emergence of a gay and lesbian com-
munity—in the U.S. military and should
be required reading for all armchair
pundits who think they have all the
answers to this civil-rights puzzle.

Shilts will remain busy for awhile.
And The Band Played On, his docu-
mentation of the first years of the AIDS
crisis, is under production for an HBO
special. Guest stars include Lily Tomlin,
Angelica Houston and Steve Martin.
Director Gus (My Private Idaho) Van
Sant is filming an adaptation of Shilts’
The Mayor of Castro Street document-
ing the life and times of the first openly
gay San Francisco supervisor, Harvey
Milk, who was assassinated in 1978.

Crumpler, Williams nab All-Amrican honors

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

For the Pitt women’s track
team, a season of brilliant
record-breaking performances
came to a close last week at . '2
the NCAA Championships in .
New "Orleans.

Before everything was said - 
and done, the seven Panthers
continued to shine when
encountering major national ‘
competition. Pitt came home
with two All-Americans as well ,
as breaking another school . E
record.

Head Coach Steve Lewis
believes his team’s performance
showed the nation just how
competitive the Panthers are.

“I’m overjoyed with their per-
formances,” Lewis said. “They
did a great job.”

The Panthers were led by
senior Ronise “Crump”
Crumpler. Crumpler qualified
in the nationals for the fourth
year in a row, despite missing
the firsthalf of the season due
to injuries.

Crumpler, who finished the
‘93 outdoor season as the top
half miler on the East Coast,

Matt Serlin/T he Pitt News
Ronise Crumpler (above) placed eighth at NCAA's.

place finish, scoring 5,207
points while breaking her per-
sonal and school record in the
long jump.

Sophomore Katina Miles also
qualified in the heptathalon,
scoring 4,809 points to place
12th overall.

“I thought Katina did a fan-
tastic job in qualifying in her
first year in major competition,”
Lewis said. “Going into the
meet, Katina was ranked 12th
in the nation and she finished
the meet with a 12th-place fin-
ish. That’s not bad for someone
who is still learning the event
and has two more years to
compete.”

Senior Allison Williams, who
was among the favorites to win
.the 100—meter hurdles, proved
that even superstars have bad
days.

Williams knocked over the
first hurdle in the finals, stum-
bled to regain her form, and
concluded her collegiate career
with a time of 13.58 seconds -
good for a disappointing 8th
place finish.

Although the most successful
hurdler in Pitt women’s history
didn’t win the national champi-

placed 8th in the 800-meters

with a time of 2:07.68 seconds. .

Crumpler’s performance in the
half mile makes her the first
middle-distance runner in the
team’s history to become an
All—American — not bad for a
person who only ran the 800
six times in her career.

The three-time All—American
also teamed up rookie Tonia
Malloy, junior Kimberly Blair

and senior workhorse Monica
Hockaday in the 4 x 400 relay‘.
The foursome ﬁnished the sea-
son ranked 10th in the nation
with a time of 3:40.61 seconds.

For Hockaday, Pitt’s 10th
place finish was quite an
accomplishment, considering
the foursome had little time to
prepare for the race.

“The week before the
Nationals, we were not sure if

we qualified or not,” Hockaday
said. “We found out Saturday
night that we qualified. Even
though our time was not fast
enough to make it to the finals,
we did a great job on a one
day’s notice.”

First-year athlete Najuma
Fletcher missed All-American
status in the heptathalon by
two places. The rookie sensa-
tion ended up with a tenth-

onship, Williams nonetheless
came home with All-American
honors. .

“Even though Allison had a
bad race, she doesn’t have any-
thing to prove,” Lewis said.
“This whole year, Allison was a
great motivator and an inspira-
tion to the younger athletes on
the team. I don’t think her suc-
cess should be measured by
what she did in one race.”

Pitt seeks instant impact from juco duo

Cauley, Peterson
bring experience,
size to Panthers’

frontcourt

By Jack Becker
Staff Writer

Some of the players who have made big
names for themselves in the NBA playoffs
are not named Jordan, Barkley or Ewing.
They are named Jolm Starks, Cedric
Ceballos and Larry Johnson.

Quick, where did all three of these guys
begin their college careers?

Time’s up. The answer is
lege.

During last year’s signing periods, Pitt
inked two junior college recruits.

Now, not insinuating that they’ll end up
alongside Starks and Johnson in the NBA
— but who really knows?

At the very least, anyway, they will play
key roles next season in the Panthers’ all-
but-depleted front court.

Willie Cauley, a 6-foot-7, 220-pound for-
ward from Niagara Falls, N.Y., and Jaime
(pronounced HI-may) Peterson, a 6-foot—9,
215-pound forward/Center out of
Champlain (Vt.) Junior College will join
Coach Paul Evans’ squad in the fall. Both
players have two years of eligibility
remaining.

 junior col-

Faced with the graduation of last year’s
starting forwards (Chris McNeal and
Antoine Jones) as well as its top reserve
(Brian Brush), Pitt will be looking to rely
heavily on the newcomers.

Cauley, a pre-season junior college All-
American, played at Dodge City (Kan.)
junior college for a year and a half, where
he averaged 17.6 points and 8.2 rebounds
a game and shot 32 percent (46-144) from
the three-point range.

Cauley left Dodge City in mid-season to
attend Finger Lakes Community College
(N.Y.) where he did not play basketball
the second semester of last year.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported in
April that Cauley was cited for shoplifting
by Dodge City police which caused him to
be dismissed from the team.

Pitt assistant coach Mark Coleman said
that Cauley had some problems with
Dodge City Coach Brad Underwood before
he transferred. Underwood and his staff,
however, have recently been relieved of
their coaching positions there.

Regardless of his problems at Dodge
City, Cauley is without a doubt the prize
catch of the 1993 Pitt recruiting class.

“I would say so,” Coleman said, “he is
very talented. He has the potential to be
whatever he wants to be. He just needs to
develop his basketball skills and fine-tune
what he has.

“He has to put all his efforts into basket-
ball and academics and he can reach his
potential,” Coleman said.

Coleman said that Cauley, who originally

signed with Duquesne, was definitely one
of the top 100 players coming out of high
school.

As a senior at Niagara Falls High School,
he averaged 28.3 points, 16 rebounds and
four steals a game while being named to
the All-New York State team. He finished
his career as the second all-time leading
scorer in school history.

Bruce Brundidge, who was head coach
at Niagara Falls when Cauley played there,
said that he was “a man among boys.”

Brundidge said he knew that Cauley -
who plays both forward positions but is at
his best as a power forward — would play
big—time college basketball.

In order to prepare Cauley for his future
in basketball, Brundidge made him split
his senior year between shooting guard
and small forward to improve his perirne-
ter game.

“Willie was powerful and strong,”
Brundidge said, “he just dominated. But he
could shoot the 20-foot jumper with excel-
lent range and excellent touch — just like
a guard.” I

Brundidge also said that Cauley would
make an immediate impact on the Panthers
next season.

“His drop step moves are incredible.
They’re just awesome  Even if he doesn’t
start he’ll be a crucial and significant part
of that team. I think Jerry McCullough will
really enjoy having Willie on the team.”

Brundidge knows a thing or two about
the Pitt program. He played for Paul Evans

Cassidy
replaces
Belowicb

Less than three months
after the resignation of
David Belowich, the Pitt
women’s swim team
coach for the last 12 sea-
sons, the university
replaced him Monday
with former Panthers
swimmer and assistant
coach Marian Cassidy.

Laure Walczak, a team-
mate of Cassidy when
she swam for Pitt, will
stay on as assistant
coach. Cassidy was an
eight—time Big East cham-
pion swimmer from 1984
to 1988. In addition to
being on seven first-place
relay squads, the
Wilmington, Del., native
won the 500 freestyle in
1985.

‘item

Cassidy was a Pitt assis-
tant coach for one year
(1988-89) until moving to
a similar position at
Florida State (1989-92).
She was an assistant
coach on the University
of Miami squad that
placed second in the Big
East last season.

-The Pitt wrestling
team added some ath-
letes and some hardware.

The Panthers added
five recruits, including
state champs Mark Bodo
of Greenville Pa. and
Chris Stevens of
Fredonia, N.Y. Mark
Johnson of Allison Park,
Pa. Larry Sprecher of
Middletown, Pa., and
John Withrow of
Elizabeth, Pa., and Rich

native transferring from
Iowa — are the other
new grapplers.

In the hardware depart-
ment, Panthers John

-Pitt center fielder Al
Lardo also got some
recognition by being

from Kentucky topped
the Panthers with 23 RBIs
and a .400 average.

at St. Lawrence University dur-
ing the late ‘70s and he talked
with Cauley about attending
Pitt. _

"We talked about Pitt, Miami,
Illinois and Arkansas,”
Brundidge said, “and I told
Willie that if he thought he had
the stuff to be the best . . . that
Coach [Evans] would get it out
of him.

“He needs to work on self-
discipline. But if coach is still
coach, he’ll have it intact,”
Brundidge said.

With all his diverse skills,
where exactly will Cauley fit
into the Panthers’ scheme?

“His best position right now
is probably power forward,”
Coleman said.

Although not as highly touted
as Cauley, fellow junior college
transfer Peterson also hopes to

Panthers’ frontcourt.

Peterson — who averaged 13
points and 10.5 rebounds :1
game while shooting 55 per-
cent from the field and 69 per-
cent from the line last year —-
will likely back up Eric Mobley
in the pivot and might possibly
see some time at forward as
well.

The much-traveled Peterson
was born in the Dominican
Republic, grew up in New York
City and played his first two
years of high school at Glen
Mills High School in
Pennsylvania.

Then he transferred to Maine
Central Institute for his senior
year and a post-graduate year.
The last stop for him was at
Champlain, where he has spent
his first two years Of college.

Now Peterson is on his way
to Pitt looking to compete in

“He’s just really starting to
improve and come into his
own,” Coleman said. “He’s thin.
He hasn’t been on the weight
program he needs to be on.

“If he gets bigger and
stronger and he plays against
good competition —— like Eric
Mobley, every day — then we
think he will be a good player.”

David Blake, assistant coach
at Champlain junior College,
says that Peterson is more of a
high—post player than a low-
post player and that he proba-
bly needs to bulk up to play in
the Big East.

“He is not a power player by
any means,” Blake said. “But

what impresses people most’

when they first see him is his
athletic ability and the way he
runs the court.

“He has good timing, and
he’s a good shot blocker from

effective rebounder with a
good desire to go and get the
ball.”

Peterson, who originally
signed with Boston College,
chose the Panthers because it is
in the Big East and because he
had the chance to play with
