Polaris, the 1964 freshman

. yearbook, has gone to press at

the William J. Keller Company
of B ,;__)_(91‘k. The hand-
book this “year started with an
inexperienced -staff, but managed
to produce _what editor Beryl
Belinkie terms a “different”
book.

The size of the pages differs
this year from previous editions
of Polaris. Another; difference in
this year’s handbook is the in-
clusion of 16 pages of colored
pictures.

iThe 1.964 O'wl’yearb0ok has
also gone to press at Ke1ler’s.
Like the Polaris, the yearbook
started with an inexperienced
staff. The staff was so inexperi-
enced that its members forgot to

coordinate the book’s completion. '

Editor Jean Kornfeld was in
I-larrisburg Ior eight weeks’ be-
tween the second trimester and
the start of summer sessions, so
she had to settle her editorial
problems by mail. The same is
true of literary editor J ane Gold,

who is in New York, and Earl
Fischl, who is in Erie.

This year’s Owl symbolizes the
.“ac,tiv»i —‘ " ' --si”cies’v-’~-of the
students on campus, according to
Paul Borman, Owl business man-
ager. The yearbook will be ready
-one week before school begins,
and will feature special sections
on each Unniversityi school.

Borman added that because of
a return of an ' appropriation
from the Department of Ath-
letics, the yearbook will include
a larger athletic section.

Dr. "William" M. Laird, Westing-

gineering, will direct a one-year
study to help improve the reli-
ability of space ﬁght.

The National Aeronautics and
Space_ Administration has granted
$21,444 to the University’s Me-
chanical Engineering Department
to ﬁnance the study. The project is
investigating the effects of ﬂight
vibrations» on curved plates and

7 cylindrical shells.

It is hoped that the results of
the study will a-id engineers in
predicting and compensating for
vnibrations during the launch and
ﬂight of space vehicles ——_ a sub-
stantial problem at present.

‘ The project’s investigations will
be done mathematically. Com-

in the Fine Books Room of the
Book Center.

This book, the last to be re-

a study of good and evil, according
to the blurb on the book’s dust
cover. The novel is the story of a
conﬂict between a widow and her
only son for a treasure which is
housed in Poynton Park, the scene
of the story.

The central character is Fleda
Vetch, a young companion of the
widowed Mrs. Gereth. Fleda falls
in love with Mrs. Gereth’s only
son Owen, who. falls in love with
the unscrupulous Mona, a coarse
and insensitive woman who de-

mands the return of furniture.

Placement Office Uncovers iWork for Stuclents O 

.5

By BOB DEQUINZE

The Student Employment Service has more jobs
for Negroes than it has Negroes to ﬁll them. The ‘part-.
time job outlook for all male students is, in fact, rela-
tively good.

Dr. Walter M. Ritenour, Director of the Service
claims his only Negro job problem is ﬁnding enough

_ 'l\Tegroes. “We havean opening right now for a personable
_young Negro in the personnel field,” he says, ‘_‘and this is ',

considered to be one of the best ﬁelds in the country.” He

feels that the Negro job problem centers around high school ,

dropouts, and that college graduates are not affected.

, While the job situation for men in general is satisfac-"_
tory, there seems to be a slight’ problem ﬁnding enough part-
time jobs for wolnen unless the women haveisecretarial skills. _

“In addition to. secretarial work,” says Dr. Ritenour,

“Some women can get part—time jobs as receptionists. There

are also positions available for lab assistants,” he says, “es-‘

pecially for women trained in the ﬁelds of math, chemistry,

. and physics.”

/

. Many Work in Mills _.
University men,.however, can get summer jobs instee
mills and other industries, and practically all of the odd jobs

Ware ‘for men only. .

_On the graduate level, the government employs quite
a few'women. Some can get jobs in retailing, a good many
become teachers, and some go into the professions, so it
seems that the work scarcity only occurs on the part—time
level. v A

Ritenour feels the trimester system gives University
students a distinct‘ advantage in getting summer employ-
ment. For example, students from schools on the trimester
or quarter system practically monopolize World’s Fair jobs.

Part Time Jobs Help

“We feel-though that studentslshould go straight through
on the trimester system,” says Ritenour, “possibly working
part-time at the same job the whole way through.” ‘

On the subject of permanent employment after grad-
uation, Ritenour claims that, “men who take ROTC and
‘ﬁnish their tour of duty are more placeable than other
graduates because the service helps them mature.”

The Employment Service and the Placement Bureau,
which handle jobs ranging from part-time garden work to
full time summer employment to permanent jobs for grad-
uates, is operated for the students and graduates of the Uni-
versity at no cost to them. — i 5

Non-Students Try to Get Jobs

“Some people who are not students attempt to use the
service,” said Thomas Rush, Placement Assistant, “but this
is pretty well stopped by requiring students to put their stu-
dent number on ‘the form they ﬁll out.” '

When a job is found for a student, he is given a referral
form and he calls the employer and sets up an appointment.
If he is hired, his record is put in the “inactive” ﬁle. When
the job ends he can have his record returned to the “active”
ﬁle by calling the service. /

Most jobs registered with the service are called in
by phone. When an employer has a job opening, he calls
the service and the job is written up on a “job? card.”
The service then screens its files for a student who can
ﬁll the position and the hours, and notiﬁes the student
by phone. .

According "to the Annual Report on Student Employment,
for the period August 1, 1962 to July 31, 1963:

1,660 students registered with the serivce.

552 of these were hired by University employers.

726 were hired by outside employers.

In 1960-1961, 1,854. students registered and 1,173 were
hired. '

In 1961-1.962, 1,775 registered and,1,147 were hired.

Tennis, Golf Teams
All/Veed Revamping  

The continued poor showing of the Panther golf and

_ tennis teams should be of some concern to athletic di-

rector Frank Carver. Both teams have made extremely
poor performances for two years now and lose to schools

v which normally would not dream of ﬁelding a team

against Pitt.

Tennis coach'Ben Pope believes that the new courts
— when they are built — will
greatly aid his program. There is
little doubt of that, but lack of
courts should not be used as an ex-
cuse for the pitiful showing of the
tennis team in the past‘ two years.

There has not been a winning
tennis ‘team here since Bill Sum-
mers was relieved of his duties

one of the most popular coaches
at Pitt —- latched on to a job at
Princeton afterleaving here.

‘His successor, Ben Pope, who
coached squash long before taking

over tennis, has not managed to come close to a winning

 

BOB SMIZIK

_ "season in histwo years at the helm.

The golf team is perhaps in worse straits than the
netters- It’s hard to remember when they last had a win-
ning ‘season. One of the biggest problems with the golfers
is the lack of a full time coach. Carver apparently has

the idea that aomajoruniversity can ﬁeld a varsity team _

with a handful of .- part-time coaches.

George Underwood, Walt Cummins and Rex Perry...

have allhad a hand in running the team in recent years
and none have met with any success.

Carver, it would appear, has three choices before,

him. He, can continue to let the golf and tennis programs
run. on the same level they have been and thus continue
to let the Panthers fall prey’ to schools with far less en-
rollment and far less scholarship aid.

Or he couldibeef up the scholarship program for
these twowsports. The only .way to ﬁeld an outstanding
athletic teams these days is with the aid of scholarships.
The competition for athletes is becoming stronger and
stronger and Pitt scholarship offers" need to be doubly
attractive since a student coming ‘here. to play tennis or
golf must face the prospect of going to school every year
until August. ’

Scliolarships Hard To Get

Getting more scholarship aid is no easy chore. Schol-
arships cost money and this commodity is hard to come
by, especially for minor sports such as golf and tennis.

‘Carver’s ﬁnal alternative would be to tone-down the
schedule even-more than it is now. Forget about schedul-
ing the likes of Navy and Penn State. The toned-down
schedule would mean the Panthers would play only the

small colleges‘ in the tri-state area which presently make,

up the major part of their schedule.

Although little success was made against teams such
as Washington and Jefferson, St. ‘Vincent, Carnegie Tech,
Westminster and Allegheny this year, it is conceivable
that 'the Panthers can win‘ their share against these
schools in the future. If they continue to gorat their pre-
sent rate they will never be up to Navy and schools of

that caliber.
F ootball_ Facts

Summer football camp for the Panther gridders will
get underway Aug. 25 at Meadville, Pa., with picture day,

while. actual drills will begin the next day and -close

Sept. 5. Coach John Michelosen’s biggest problem appears
to be rebuilding his line where all seven regulars gradu-
ated. However, Michelosen has plenty of lettermen back

on the line and in the end the major weakness of the ‘

team may be a weak second unit. »

The 1965 football schedule recently announced by
Carver looks like one of the toughest the Panthers have
faced in some time. The schedule includes Oregon, Okla-
homa, West Virginia, Duke, .Navy, Miami, Syracuse,
Notre Dame, USC, and Penn State.

V Duke, Oklahoma and USC are newcomers to the
schedule replacing Army, UCLA and William and Mary,
who will be met this season. ' '

- but their skits reached every
. person in the audience.

The music of Joe Negri tried to

keep the performers united» and on
key but failed most of the time,
often intentionally. The wel1-re-
hearsed play ran with full speed
from punchline to punchline with
roaring laughs, some silent fail-
ures, and with hard-hitting real-
’ ism satirizing American society.

Society Lives on Stage_
America’s families are ruined

according to sociologists. The lack
of subtleness in the skits raised
questions for the thinking audi-

« ence. Are broken homes cau-sed
by TV? Is happiness only in plays,
asked Joe Negri? Should one go
back to the old home town even
if it is as a doctor to make money?
Is the handsome doctor who in-
vzi-tes the bar girl to his apartment
for a night a Dr. Jekyll and Mr.

lHyde? These were some of the
themes of the songs in “400 Miles
Off Broadway."

One can take these as normal
questions that s o c i e t y faces
every day. We as Americans ‘in-
habit this society called the land
of the free. Pittsburgh, accord-
ing to the performers, is a dirty,
hated city where rapes, mur-
ders, scandals, and common-
place occurences give every cit-

izen a chill. But society turns-

its attention to “Mr. Right,” as
Esther Lapiduss does, and to a
boy-friend who is “religion edi-
tor of Playboy.”

All Americans have a big, brand

new car, and a ranch home, sings
Bob McCully in
They shop in the A&P, collect
Plaid stamps, take pills, follow
trends and conform so much that
ifpa person doesn’t conform, he
conf-orms by being a nonconform-
ist. ,

The show represents the Amer-I
ica 400 Miles Off Broadway that
doesn’t need a location. It needs
just an audience, performers, and
a conforming American society to
portray on stage.

‘Snakes

By MATT SWETONIC

If the peddlers of the
thousand—and—one s n a k e
bite kits, tonics, ointments-,
and remedies on sale in this
country would have their‘
way, every Sunday morn-
ing gardener would carry ‘a

knzipsackfull of their products’ -

every’ time he went out to
check the consistency of his
_manure pile, for let’s face it
kids, outside of someone run-
ning down the block screaming
that the Russians are in the
Squirrel Hill tunnel, nothing is
more frightening to the average
.American‘:than the announce-
ment that a shake has been
sighted in the back yard.

Not since Tamerlane has any
living creature been hated and
feareduso much as is the lowly
snake. Slayer of millions, hunt-
er of mankind, plague of the
woods, deﬁler of Paradise --
phooey! — If one can believe
James A’. O1iver’s paper-back
book_S’na.kes In Fact and Fic-
tion (National History Library
Editions, 214, pages,- $1.25), the
snake is as cuddly a creature as
anyone would ever hope to
spend a night with "in a sleep-
ing ‘bag. ‘

Slightly Dangerous

Not that Mr. Oliver advises
shaking hands with every.Fer-
de-lance that slithers up onto
the front porch for a chat, for
he still claims that you stand
a better chance of being tramp-_‘
led to death by a buffalo in
Times Square than of being

killed by a snake bite. In his
favor he has the statistics.

Fewer than three dozen
people in this country are
killed each year by snakes.
When the speedy rattlesnake
gets up a full head of steam,

‘he can zip along the ground

In Fact And Fiction’

,-«._

The Western Diamondback Rattlesnake, one of the most venemous
of American snakes, accounts for relatively few ‘deaths in the
United States due to his slow cruising speed of 2.04 M.P.H. I _
(Photo by Sam Danton, courtesy New York Zoological’ Society.)

.Outside of being‘ a panacea
for nervous woodsmen. Mr.
Oliver's book is a fascinating
and wellﬁwritten diprinto the
world of the herpetologist. In
a chapter entitled ‘Snake
Charmers’ or
Snake Dance Debunked,’ the
author presents some curious "
facts concerning the famous
snake worship mambo of the
Hopi indians and other dare-
devil cults and institutions
wh i c h feature venomous

snakes as a part of their
trade. ~—

at the astonishing pace 'of
2.04 miles per hour.

- _ Also. the deadly copperhead
is so dangerous that a small
child, even if untreated after
being bitten, will almost never
die. The lightning-fast strike of
the Timber rattler is about one-
half as fast as a man can punch
with his ﬁsts and less than one-
ﬁfth as fast as he can swing a
golf club.

World Menace

True, the snake is amenace
in many parts of the world such
as India where the fatalities
from snake bite rise into the
tens of thousands, but as far
as this country :5 concerned the
statistics show that you are
safer tromping about in woods
where snakes abound than you
are lounging in your bath tub.

Although Snakes may not be
abook to astound the literary
world, it certainly" makes’ for

feared and maligned creature.
