William Blader Admits
“Accidental” Slaying,

William Blader was a part-time student, carrying one course in
foreign language. He had been at the University for only three weeks.
He was well recommended, both as to character and ability, by the
chairman of the Guidance committee of his high school. He had stood
high in his high school class. His record of accomplishment in class
work was supported by the report of the intellectual interest which
he had shown in high school in such ﬁelds as biochemistry, paleon-

tology, and astro—physics.

Flying Club Meets

The next meeting of the Flying
Club will take place October 25
the fourth hour. (The room num-
ber will "be given out at a later

date.)

The main feature of the coming
meeting will be the screening of
a combat ﬁlm, taken by Bill Price,
University student, during action.
Bill was formerly in the European
Theater of -Operatio-ns and has
108 missions to his credit. A for-

 Major and Squadron Com-
Faander, , he spent eighteen months

verseajs. in -the Eighth Air Force.

 

Having confessed to l-ocal police
authorities -of the “accidental”
slaying of Frank -M. Amberson,
Springdale merchant, William
Blader, part-titrne student at the
University, has broken into the
headlines of Pittsburgh’s leading
newspapers. -.

Blader’s arrest came at 2 o’clock
Sunday morning. 44 hours after
Mr. Amberson’s body was found
on the sidewalk-beside the Car-
negie Music hall in Schenley Park.

The 18-year-old youth confess-
ed that he was doing a little “tar-
get practising” about 1 a. m. be-
hind the Music hall when Mr.
Amberson was sh-ot.

The arrest followed a tip to
police that Blader had purchased
a revolver Thursday at the South
Hills Sports center in Brookline.

Blader denied knowing Mr. Am-
berson -or that he had shot the
man and then robbed him.

He said he was at his job as a

janitor at the Pittsburgh Play-
house until 12:30 o’clock Friday
morning. He said he had placed
the gun in his pocket.
, After quitting work, he said he
ate at a ‘Forbes Street diner, then
walked to Schenley Park where
he went to the rear of the Music
Hall.

He told police, “I took the gun
out of my pocket ‘and tried it.

“I walked up four steps on the
rear of the Music Hall and ﬁred
twice in an upward direction to-
ward the trees. Then I walked
down the steps, turned to my left
and ﬁred two more shots. I held
the gun just level with my chest.

“After a few seconds, somebody
ran towards me, then on past me.
This person was a man, and he
was kind of stooped over as if in
pain. He ran to the walk nearest
the building and fell.

“I had started towards this man,
but when ‘I saw him fall, I turned
around and went home and went
to bed.”

When asked whether he had
ever seen -Mr. Amberson before
the shooting, Blader answered,
“N o, I never knew or saw him be-
fore.”

When he read of the death in
the newspapers about 3 o’clock
Friday afternoon, Blader said he
was “afraid” to tell he had ﬁred
the fatal shot.

At the time the Pitt News went
to press, the police doubted Blad-
er’s statement and believed that
further developments would oc-
cur soon.

Applications for admission to
the 1946 class of the School of
Medicine will be given out
during the week of October 22.
All students who will have the
requirements -completely by the
fall of 1946 and who are in-
terested in making application
are asked to call at the College

New Teachers

Join Staff

Six chemistry -appointments
were announced this week by Dr.
Alexander Silverman, head of the
department.

Captain Douglas G. Nicholson of
the Army Chemical Warfare Serv-
ice has been named associate pro-
fessor of inorganic chemistry, sub-
ject to his release from the armed
services. Dr. Nicholson received
his Bachelor of Science, Master of
Science and Doctor of Philosophy
degrees from the University of
Illinois, where he was associate in
chemistry, before entering active
duty in 1942. His research inter-
ests include drying of linseed oil
paints and study of titaniun com-
pounds.

Five of the appointees are in-
cluded in the chemistry research
group: Dr. Calvin Golumbic, of
Rutgers, assistant research pro-
fessor in biochemistry who is mak-
ing a study of ﬂavor and odor
changes in soybean oil; Dr. Mar-
jorie Benoy, of Ohio State univer-
sity, senior research fellow in bio-
chemistry who is working on the
problem of fat deterioration as re-
lated to the stability of food prod-
ucts; Eleanor Quint, of Seton Hill,
resarch assistant in biochemistry;
and Madelyn Montroll Klein, Pitt
graduate, junior research fellow in
physical chemistry.

The chemistry department also
announced that Standard Brands,
Incorporated, has established a
graduate research scholarship in
biochemistry.

Panhelt Discussion

At Stephen Foster

All members of women’s fra-
ternities will meet tonight in
Stephen Foster memorial at 7:30
o’clock for a !Panhellenic dis-cus-
sion and social.

A panel board of six fraternity
women will discuss the advantages

and disadvantages of raising the-

quota of 30 for each of Pitt’s fra-
-ternities. I

For those who are missed in
classes and for those who want to
-pay on pledges, a booth will be
set up on the ground ﬂoor corri-
dor. Those who -pay here will
also receive a red feather and a
Pitt War Fund tag.

All pled.ges must be paid by
November 30.

Chairman of the student drive,
Phyllis Krieger, ~C, hopes that each
student will contribute two dollars
to the -fund. She said, “'With a
goal of $2,550 more than last year
and a student pledge of $4,vO5r0~ the
drive will need the help of every
Pitt student. Since we have a
higher pledge than most colleges,
we must be doubly sure that it is
met. Cooperation is essential.”

Agencies at the University that
will receive some of the money
collected are the YMCA, YWCA,
the Studen_t Loan fund, and “Pitt
in China,” a Pitt education pro-

gram for Chinese students.

Department

2. The physical standards pre-
scribed for apointment in the
Oﬁieers’ Reserve Corps . . .,
will apply.

3. The applicant must requiremat
least two academic year to
complete all requirements for
graduation or, if a graduate
student,
period to complete all work for
an advanced degree.

Veterans who have been honor-
ably discharged or transferred to
the Enlisted Reserve -Corps and
relieved from active duty will be
given credit _in lieu of all or part
of the ‘basic couse, ROTC, on the
following basis:
1.For not less than 6 months ac-

tive service in the Army, Navy,

Marine Corps, or Coast Guard,

credit in lieu of the first year of

States Government under the fol-
lowing provisions:

1. The student agrees unless soon-
er discharged to complete the
advanced course and to attend
the advanced camp at the time

Things Are Di]fferent---
Come On Pitt!

Pitt, still stinging from its upset loss. at the hands of Michigan
State, aims, this week, at doing the same thing to a highly—touted
Notre Dame team when it comes to town Saturday. It hardly needs
be said that this is the most important game of the season for Pitt.

from the “Irish” and this year Pittites are determined that things “is
gonna be diff’runt.” No more of that Ibig-score stuff. This year Pitt

Last year Student Congress was criticized severely for its
action regarding University dances. There were many accusa-
tions ﬂung at the organization for its cancellation of one of
Pitt’s large dances; but such action was taken due to the failure
of thgee preceding dances. The student body, as a whole,
pleaded for another chance to show that it still desired dances at
Pitt and would attend them wholeheartedly. An informal af-

fair, instead of an elaborate one, was suggested. Thus, Student
Congress arranged for a dance in the women ’s gym, and we who
remember know that it was well supported and ﬁnancially a
success. S

This year no Pitt event of any large proportion had been
scheduled until it was decided that Student Congress shoud

S , handle the Hello Week program. School spirit was at an all

time low, and to undertake the planning for such an event would
mean a lot of hard, unappreciated work. However, the social
committee is now to be commended for their ﬁne work and we
congratulate them on the success of the Howdy Hop.

But “leave us not” drop the subject there. From all indi-
cations the students at Pitt want more informal dances, such as
the Howdy Hop. With the increased enrollment there is every
reason to expect continuance of high attendance at any follow-
ing dances. The admission was inexpensive and the music satis-
factory.

Also such affairs make for better unity between fraternity,
and independent factions.

Thus, in conclusion, we hope that Student Congress will
take, action once again; this time to schedule more dances for
Pitt students.

7/an W /Veam Know

Though the magnitude of atomic power has not yet had
time to fade from our minds, the lessons supposedly learned
from this and all other previous wars seem already to have
been forgotten. A short while ago, ﬁve men met in London to
discuss the terms of the future peace—ﬁve men representing
the United States, England, Russia, China, and France. Last
week, these same ﬁve men returned to their people that they
had failed to come to suitable agreements. Who is to blame?
Why have they failed and thus destroyed the “last best chance
on earth”?

The conference did not fail because of controversies which
withstood every attempt at ‘solution. It did not fail because
Russia stubbonly re-fused compromise or because the United
States made demands which could not be met. The fear of an
expansion of communist ideology is still greater in our minds
than war itself. Russia fears a capitalist intervention more than
a world struggle. It is still the attitude of “me” and “mine”
instead of “us” and “ours.” In short, it is fear.

We seem to have two camps, Russia on one side and the
other “big” four on the other side. Now let us see what both

sides have done which has thus prevented a peaceful compro-
misc:

1. The United States and Great Britain have tried to form
By political and even
military pressure they have forced reactionary governments
upon the people of Belgium, Italy, Greece, and even Germany
a.nd Japan. In such a manner they have attempted to stop the
spread of communism and incidentally have a ﬁrst line of de-
fense in a possible outbreak of hostilities with Russia. This is
a direct violation of the bond of friendship with Russia which
has -been established during this war. It is more than that. It

2 is a slap in the face of the Russian people.

What has Russia done as a counter measure? Russia has
forced communist-oriented governments on the peoples close _to
her border. Thus, Moscow has a ﬁrst line, against a capitalist

’ :~,intervention (remember 1918?) and also in a possible new war.

This is a violation of the Atlantic Charter also and so a break of
ifriendship.

Vet GI Zette

The Pitt Veterans association is
off to a roaring start. At a meet-
ing last Wednesday a temporary
executive committee was appoint-
ed to draft plans for the coming
year’s program. A major concern
of the Association will be veteran
housing, employment, and educa-
tional problems. With 1,000 vet-
erans in school this year and 2,000
expected next year, it is easy to
see the part that housing and em-
ployment will play in the diﬁicul-
ties of a newly arrived vet stu-
dent.

The Association will devote a
large portion of its activity to-
ward making this anticipated situ-
ation less acute. This is not all
the Association helps to do but it
is diﬁicult to explain the complete
program because there are so
many good ideas in it that it is
hard to give any other than a very
general glimpse into the agenda.
It wasn’t possible to accept new
members at registration week but
membership cards will be printed
and distributed as soon as possible
to what is hoped will be a hun-
dred percent of the veteran en-
rollment.

Scholastic Honor Roll”

The following Scholastic Honor R011 contains the names of the
classiﬁed undergraduate students who, during the spring semester,
1944-45, carried not less than 14 credits and earned a quality point
average of 2.40 or better for the semester. The quality points as-
signed to the various grades are: A-3, B-2, C-1, D-0, F-minus 1.
The quality point average was determined by dividing the total num-
ber of quality points by the number of credits carried. Credits earned
in courses for which the grades P, W, or G were given have not been
counted.

The names are arranged in order, according to quality point aver-
ages. In the last column appear the names of the high schools from
which the students were graduated. Unless otherwise indicated, the

on Long Distance

You can't see the rush on Long Distance, but it's bigger than ever.
Many thousands of the calls are from returning service men. 50
please helb them get their calls through faster by limiting your
call to ﬁve minutes when the operator requests if, and by making

only necesary Long Distance calls in the evening.

It won't Ive like this forever. We're hard at it to take the pressure
off our lilies and to “resume speed” once more with the Bell
System's llule standards of service. Next yeor—we can tell you
now——2,l0D,000 miles of Long Distance Telephone circuits are
to be added to the Bell System. That's more Long Distance circuits

than there were in both Great Britain and France before the war.

Biology Experiments

The American Weekly for No-
vember 11 will publish an illus-
trated article dealing with tropical
conditions and their effects upon
material and equipment as estab-
lished by Dr. Peter Gray, pro-
fessor of biology. Under a tropi-
cal testing program sponsoredl
jointly by the University, Westing-
house Electric, and several other
large companies, Dr. Gray and his
assistants began work in this ﬁeld
in 1940. _

The biologist’s laboratory is
now revealing facts about the be-
havior of electrical equipment
when subject to extreme temper-
ature, humidity, and biological at-
tack from fungi and bacteria. The
research, _la_rgely in electrical
equipment, has not been entirely
limited; everything from metals
and parachute fabric to thread and
the Army K—ration is being tested.

“The ﬁrst problem,” said Dr.
Gray, “is to ﬁnd how serious a
threat the conditions can be. The
second is to select materials that
resist fungus growth or develop
lacquers, varnishes, and waxes that
are poisonous or indigestible to
fungi.”

In the laboratory, Dr. Gray has
glass containers no bigger than a
cookie jar, complete with moss,
rotting vegetation, fungus growth,
bacteria, heat, and humidity.
These are called “tropical jars.”
Under carefully controlled condi-
tions, the biologist places samples
of the material to be tested in the
tropical jars and subjects them to
daily microscopic examinations to
determine the reactions. Var-
nishes of the phenol formalde-
hyde group, for example, have
proved very resistant to attack
from fungi and bacteria. “Fos-
terite,” a Westinghouse-developed
plastic with 100 per cent moisture
prooﬁng qualities, drew a rating
of excellent in turning back fungi
attacks. A major part of the trop-
icalization program has continued
at the University under a contract
with the Army Air Forces.

Dr. Gray came to the University I

   

  

Dr. Peter Gray

in 1939 and the following year be-
came interested in the problem for

which he is now being recognized.
All facilities of the University
were made available and the trop-
ical testing program was initiated
under Dr. Gray’s direction. As-
sistance was given him by: Mrs.
Josephine Heckman, Mrs. Patiana
Reisachaer, and Misses Jean De
Woody, Peggy Laschinger, and
Helen Goggin.

A graduate of the University of
London, Dr. Gray spent seven
years at the University of Edin-
borough. Before coming to Pitt,
he had a Rockefeller Fellowship at
the University of Rochester.

Anyone who is interested in
working on the circulation staff
of the Owl, please come to the
meeting on Wednesday at 3:30
o’clock in the Owl otﬁce.

Dorothy Anthony,
Circulation Manager.

Schwager Sails
For Pacific

Many service people are on their
way home from the battle areas
but Eleanor Schwager, a recent
graduate is reversing the proced-
ure. She expects to sail next week
from San Francisco to the South
Paciﬁc.

Eleanor has been appointed staff
assistant for the American Red
Cross. She had one duty to per-
form‘ before she went, however.
She came to Pittsburgh to present
in person a check to the Univer-
sity. in its campaign to raise $100,-
000 .to' complete the womens floor
of the Cathedral of Learning.

‘She attended the School of
B u s i n e s s Administration from
which she was graduated in 1943.
She worked a year and a half in
the Bursars ofﬁce here before en-
listing with the Red Cross. In Feb-
ruary she applied for training for
overseas work and was accepted
in September. Since then she has
completed ﬁve weeks training, in
basic work in Washington and in
ﬁeld work at lndiantown Gap.

She isthe niece of Mr. and Mrs.
Leo Miller of 444 Mapleton Ave-
nue, and a graduate of Mt. Leb-
anon High School. At ‘Pitt she
was a member of Theta Phi Al-
pha social fraternity and was stu-
dent assistant in the Darlington
Library for historical research.

Neisi Coed Relates Experiences
In Western Relocation Camp

By Ruth Weinstein V

“Anti—Neisi prejudice is still rife, on the West ‘Coast especially,”
declares Hana Eejima, Pitt’s pert Neisi coed. Many acts of terrorism
are reported daily by the Washington War Relocation Ofﬁce which
never appear in the newspapers.

Wishing only to forget the three years she spent in relocation
camps, Hana is now staying with a family on the Northside. Relieved
to be settled at last, she likes Pittsburgh, but is wary of “this thing

A

called smog.” '

Of war relocation camp life,
Hana says ruefully, “It was not a
normal way of living. All our
lives we worked hard to make a
living and suddenly everything
came to a halt. We lost our farms,
our businesses, professional prac-
tices, and were thrust into a mili-
tary-like camp with nothing to
do.”

’Hana spent her high school
years in San Diego. In the sum-
mer of 1941 when trade between
Japan and the United States was
stopped, the Neisi realized that
“something was going to burst in
the Paciﬁc.” Hana’s family moved
to Los Angele’s “Little Tokyo.”

First scene of camp life was
the Santa Anita Assembly Center,
formerly the famed race track.
From May to September, 1942,
Hana lived in the midst of high
emotional tension. She carried
away the ugly memory of riot
which started when civilian police

without the proper authority start-
ed conﬁscating such things as
canned goods from the remaining
possessions of the uprooted Neisi.

Her destination was the Amachi
Relocation Center in southern
Colorado. Although one of the
smallest of the camps, containing
7,000 people, the camp was oper-
ated on a purely military basis
with barracks and marshalls.
Each family was alloted one room.
If it had more than six members,
it got a second room. Six families
lived in each barrack and 200 peo-
ple in each block.

Although some community life
existed, no privacy or individuality
was to be had, Hana related.

Church services were held both
in English and Japanese, the lat-
ter for the old folks. The former
agriculturalists tended to ‘be Budd-
ists, while city dwellers were
1 a r g e 1 y -Christian. Caucasian
school teachers were imported to

teach school. Although dances,
football, and basketball were en-
couraged, the children were left
with too much leisure for their
sorely circumscribed lives.

Located on a prairie on the Dust
Bowl, the camp was surrounded
by a tall wire fence with towers
at various points from which MP5
kept vigilence. Cooped within,
the adults’- only occupation was an
inadequate amount of maintenance
work. Professional people were
paid 19 dollars each month; cleri-
cal workers, of which Hana was
one, 16 dollars; and manual work-
ers, 12 dollars. Some resentment
could not help but be felt, Hana
says, when a Neisi doctor received
19 dollars a month while a Causa-
sian doctor doing identical work
got 300 dollars.

Eight hundred to 900 soldiers
were drafted from the camp dur-
ing Hana’s stay. Some of them
fought in Italy, while others served
as interpreters and in intelligence
in the South Paciﬁc. Their heroic
work in intelligence was never
publicized for the sake of the boys’
safety. By the end of Hana’s stay
40 boys had already been killed.
Those who came “home” on fur-
loughs were glad to ﬁght for their
country, but wanted their folks to
leave the relocation camps as soon
as possible. “It isn't a normal way
of living,” Hana repeated.

Today the camps are being
broken up as fast as the War Re-
location Otﬁce can resettle the in-
habitants throughout the country.
Although Hana herself has never
had any trouble, opposition and
violence are meeting many of her
fellow Neisi.

Panther outﬁt, 12-7, -at Pitt Sta-

_diu,m Saturday. It was all Michi-

gan State the ﬁrst half after they
discovered the Pitt pass defense
very vulnerable. Roussos’ fumble

early in the fray paved the way
for the ﬁrst Spartan touchdown.
Ziegler caught Reader’s pass and
carried it to the Pitt 20. The

‘ Michigan 11 then made a fast
_ﬁrst down and Contos, on a beau-

tifully executed reverse, carried
the .ball over from the nine.

{Pitt came back ﬁghting and car-
ried the ball to the Spartan 2'5
beforea cli.pping penalty and a

large loss drove the Panthers back
into their own territory.

Pitt was a diﬁerent team in the
second half and threatened con-

stantly but penalties at the wrong
time repeatedly st'opped their
drives. But ﬁnally with three min-
utes of the fourth quarter gone,
Robinson caught a Breslin punt
and behind some ﬁne blocking by
Zimmovan, scampered 87 yards
for a Pitt tally. Roussos kicked the
extra -point and the Panthers ap-
peared as if they were going to
come through on top. Ranii inter-
cepted a State pass and ran it to
Michigan 36 before he was stop-
ped. But the Spartans held and
were again threatening as the
game ended.

pre-season gossip. The South

followed up by handily defeating
Georgia Tech 40-7, scoring in

Irish Heavy Favorite

The fracas this weekend will
mark the third meeting of the two
schools in the most recent series
of competition. In the previous
scraps the Irish inﬂicted two of
the most humiliating defeats a
University of Pittsburgh grid
eleven has ever suffered. The last
Pitt victory over Notre Dame came
in 1937 when a Jock Sutherland
coached club overpowered the
enemy 21-6. This fall the Panth-
ers are said to have one of their
best squads in years and although
they will be a decided underdog
this Saturday, they can cause the
invaders a good deal of grief.

Western Penna. stars against Pitt.
Among those present from district
ranks is the new sensation of the
Irish running attack, Phil Colella,
the Beaver Valley Speedster from
Rochester High. Colella holds
down a starting berth in the Notre
Dame backﬁeld which possesses
speed, power, and deception. In
the driver’s seat is Captain Frank
Dancewicz, a 180-pound New Eng-
lander and a monogram winner at
quarterback last year. Elmer
Angsman, weighing 185 pounds
and preppingat Mt. Carmel, Chi-
cago is the regular right halfback
and burly Frank Ruggerio will
start at fullback. The Irish back-
ﬁeld will average 186 pounds. The
Notre Dame forward wall is heavy
and aggressive. Bob Skoglund, an
188-pounder from Chicago and the
only returning wingman will be
at one end, and Hoppy Leonard, a
6.2 freshman from Youngstown,
Ohio will be at the other. Both
are excellent pass snatchers and
are stalwarts on defense. Veterans
Pete Berezney and Ed. Mieszkow-
ski are cinches to start at guard.
Both are big boys at 6.2 and going
over the 200-pound mark. Two

being John Mastrangelo, a power-

What happened to Pitt on Saturday afternoon? Were the Panthers
overrated or was it one of those days that a team has to get out of

their system?

Or could it be that they aren’t accustomed to a dry

turf? Maybe we have a team of mudders! Against Illinois we played

on a ﬁeld drenched by intermittent rains.

At the stadium on two

successive Saturdays it poured and the ﬁeld was in poor condition.
Pitt came out of those three tussels with wins over West Virginia and

Bucknell and a loss to Illinois,¢

which is just what was expected.
In all three battles Pitt played the
best football since Shaughnessy
took over the helm. Then came
Michigan State, a team which
everyone thought Pitt would beat
and along with the Spartans came
ideal football weather -and loss
Number 2.

Without a doubt the Panthers
didn’t play the same type of ball
in Saturday's defeat as they did
against the “Fighting Illini.”
Every fan left the game that day
saying “Pitt has a ﬁghting ball
club and had the breaks gone their
way the score might have been in
reverse.” Why not keep that spirit
alive? Support the Notre Dame
Pep Rally tomorrow in Stephen
Foster Memorial at 11:30 o’clock.
Show the team we are still behind
them despite that ﬁnalscore.

In Reverse

It had previously been thought
that it would take Notre Dame to
test the true Panther strength but
Michigan State brought it to a
head a week too soon, as far as
Pitt rooters are concerned. Our
offense never did get rolling nor
our defense started. When a team

. traps’ their opponent 15 yards back

of their line of scrimmage and
then allows the runner to get
away for a gain something is lack-
ing in the fundamentals of tack-
ling. Another deﬁnite weakness
was in pass defense. The Panthers
were unable to knock down those
Spartan passes. Both touchdowns
Vere indirectly made by the air-
ways, the ﬁrst completed forward
was well over the head of the Pitt

man who had let his opponent get
ahead of him. This poor defense
for passing was evident in last
year’s Panther games especially
in the Notre Dame classic, when
Bretelli and Gasparella riddled
Pitt with their aerials. Z might
be the last letter of the alphabet,
but the Z formation was far ahead
of Shaughnes"sy’s offensive T. If
it hadn’t been for Robinson’s 87
yard touchdown run the Panthers
would have gone scoreless. Passes
everywhere and very few com-
plete, that’s the story of the Pitt
passing attack.
Onto Victory

Now that the game is over and
analyzed let’s forget about it. The
Pitt eleven can feel either of two
ways when they trot back onto the
stadium ﬂoor Saturday afternoon
against Notre Dame. Either go
out with the feeling of revenge and
proﬁt by those mistakes made
against Michigan State or else
stagger out with the defeatist
feeling. We know they are going
out with the feeling to win in their
hearts and on their lips will be our
Pitt Victory Song.

Cagers Hard At Work:
Outlook Very Bright

In the waning days of the 1940-41 basketball seascm. Dr. H. C.
Carlson’s Pitt passers were nudged out of the NCAA ﬂoor tourney by

a Wisconsin quint that went on to

win the championship.

That marked the last time the Panthers tasted tournament gravy.

However, this may be the year

for a change of pace.

With a sprinkling of six letter-
men speckling the roster, Carlson
possesses a ﬂock which also bears
the markings of an All-WPIAL
team.

Among the standouts. for in-
stance, is Norb Borowicz, a New
Wilmington product who did his
shooting under the tutorship of
Johnny Eagleson. Norb was the
mainstay of a New Wilmington

ﬁve that walked off with the
WPIAL’s Class B court crown in
1943. The Stadium boards will

not be new to the slick ball-‘A

handler as it was there that he
ﬂashed form that tabbed him the
outstanding college prospect of the
1943 eliminations.

Another of the aspirants for var-
sity berths is Alex Medich, Du-
quesne High ace. When the Dukes
bagged the state title in 1944,
Medich was considered their big
defensive stop—gap.

Cairns, Ligonier ﬂash, is an-
other of the WPIAL products bid-
ding for a slot with Carlson’s
crew. Sparking Ligonier into the
semi—ﬁnals of the Class B tourna-
ment last season, he poured in 60
points in three games to easily
seal tourney honors in that de-
partment.

Party Politics

(Ed. Note: The following is thee
response of a University student
to Jim Pettican’s article of last
week. The opinion expressed here-
in does not necessarily reﬂect the
attitude of The Pitt News edito-
rial staﬁ.)'

By Audrey Langdon

There are some who disagree
with the article on Pearl Harbor
in last week’s Pitt News. The facts
on the other side of the ledger
are clear and c-oncise.

In 1941, the U. S. was- woefully
unprepared. The defense effort
was a half-«hearted attempt by in-
dustrialists who were loath to con-
vert. Administration moves for
preparedness were blocked .by
isolationists and Republicans as a
matter of political strategy.

Lend-Lease did not weaken the
defense program. It keyed a few
essential war industries.

sons, Gary, Philip, Dennis, and

mier, requested a meeting with
President Roosevelt to discuss a
peace offer to China. The State
Department blocked the meeting,
because the Chinese rejected a ne-
gotiated peace. A treaty then
would have given Japan powerful
forces to throw into the conquest

dies, long before marked as es-
sential to the Greater East Asia
Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Jap
time-schedule for conquest had
been made out about 1938, with
German aid. 7

In 1941, Britain was still under
blitz attack. The German armies
were slashing toward Moscow.
Tokyo decided not to wait for the
signal from Berlin.

‘The Jap-anese attack ﬂeet, six
carriers, two battleships, two

heavy cruisers, one light cruiser,
and a destroyer -division, had be-
gun training in July or August,
according to the army’s report on
Pearl Harbor. ‘The ships assem-
bled off North Japan in Novem-
ber. The task force sailed Novem-
ber 27, on a northerly route south
of the Aleutians. They then head-
ed due east to a point substantial-»
ly north: of Hawaii. From there,
they proceeded southward to a
point 3-00 miles from Oahu, where
300 of the 424 planes were launch-
ed.

Big submarines, with midgets
lashed to their top decks, operated
off Hawaii. Five of the two-man
subs ,_were launched near Pearl
Harbor a few days before the at-
tack. Two entered the harbor
when the not was opened for out-
going and 'in—coming garbage
scows. (Roberts report). Another
was sunk in restricted waters out-
side the harbor a few minutes be-
fore the Jap planes struck.

Pvt. Joseph L. Lockhard, 20, of
Williamsport, Pa., a member of
an aircraft warning regiment, had
stayed overtime at his mountain
outpost near Honolulu, because
Pvt. George E. Elliot, of Elmhurst,
Ill., who later became a sergeant,
asked him to remain for a demon-
stration of radar. Lockhard spot-
ted on the Radar screen “a large
number :of -airplanes,” approaching
from 136 miles away. This was
ﬁf'ty—thre-er minutes before the at-
tack, according to the Roberts re-
port. The air-raid warning system
operated ordinarily only from 4
a. m. to 7 a. m. The attack came at
7:55.

The Roberts report says Look-
hard reported at 7:02 to an “inex-

perienced lieutenant.” The then
under Secretary of War Patterson
said that Lockhard also reported
to the Army Information Center.
The lieutenant “assumed” the
planes were friendly. He thought
they were AAF B-17s, scheduled
to arrive from the mainland. Lt.
Kermit A. Tyler, of Iowa, who
the Army Pearl Harbor‘ Board
found performed an “indefensible”
action when he told Lockhard to
forget it, is now a Lieutenant-
colonel in the AAF.

A year later, Lt. Lockhard, hold-
er of the Distinguished Service
Medal, -said, “It’s better not to
think what might have happened
that morning. It’s like crying over
spilled milk.”

There never has been any con-
clusive proof of the statement
that the U. S. had cracked the
“Jap” secret diplomatic code. This
was ﬁrst published in an article in
Life magazine by John Chamber-
lain, in which he claimed Gov.
Dewey “knew the full story of
Pearl Harbor” but did not use it
in the 1944 presidential campaign,
because of urgent requests from
General Marshall. Chamberlain al-
so said that “Roosevelt and his
advisers knew what the Japan-
ese were going to do well in ad-
vance of the overt rupture in
relations,” but had “elected to
bring the crisis to a. head when it
came.”

CBS vcorrcspondent Edward R.
Murrow ﬁrmly believes that
Roosevelt was surprised by the
J ap attack on Pearl Harbor, Mur-
row dined at the White House that
Sunday evening, so that he could
report to the President on Britain
and the Blitz. While Murrow wait-
ed, there was a steady stream of
visitors, cabinet members and
Senate leaders. He told reporters
that Stimson, Knox, and Hwull were
surprised by the news. He was not
summoned by the President until
after midnight. Before Murrow
left the President asked if he were
surprised by Pearl Harbor. To
Murrow’s reply Roosevelt said,
“Maybe you think it didn’t sur-
prise us!”

The American wife of Jap

in Tokyo a_ few days ago that her
husband had no knowledge of
plans for the Pearl Harbor at-

tack, and that their son was en-
raged at the Jap government for
having placed Kurusu in such an
awkward position. She said he had
been sincere and had felt “that
he was‘ one of the few men in the
country who might make a success
of the mission.”

Shigenori Togo, the man who
sent Kurusu to Washington, said
that he had hoped a compromise
would be possible. His family
claimed that he did not know in
advance of the sneak attack; For-
mer Jap Premier Suzuki told an
American correspondent that Em-
peror Hirohito did. not know Japan
had attacked Pearl Harbor until
told by the militarists. This opin-
ion was shared by the present
premier, who told a press confer-
ence he hoped to create a commis-

sion to investigate responsibility

for the war.

Senator Burton K. Wheeler, pre-
war isolationist, suggested that
every communication of the War,
Navy, and State departments prior
to December 7, 1941, be considered
in Congress’ investigation of
Pearl Harbor. He also thought the
Army and Navy Intelligence re-
ports. should be investigated. He
did not mention a review of Con-
gress’ voting record and debates
on preparedness measures. Wheel-
er absolved Congress and the gen-
eral public of any blame.

At the end of that week, Life
published the article in which it

said that Roosevelt knew about the '

'impe~n:dIing attack, and that Gov-
ernor D-ewey had refrained from
using his information in the cam-
paign. Shortly after, Republican

National Chairman Herbert BroW- _

nell gave Republican congressmen
full credit f-on launching the pres-
ent investigation. He said, “The
fact that several persons who held
high po-s-itions on December 7,
1941, are now dead do-es not of-
fer any justiﬁcation for conceal-
ing any part of the truth.”

Thus, the Pearl Harbor story
seems destined to become a play-
