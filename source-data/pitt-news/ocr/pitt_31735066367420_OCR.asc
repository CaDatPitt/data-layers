Radio Enthusiasts Attempt
To Begin Broadcasting

_ By TOM McGOVERN

The personnel of WPGH,

station of the University, may soon make another attempt
to go on the air on a regular schedule.

For some years past, interested ‘students and faculty

members have been working on ‘the project of a small

campus station which would serve as a news and cultural

THE REMAINS of the last attempt to broadcast are viewed with
both curiosity and amazement by a member of the newly organized
amateur radio group. Another broadcasting attempt is planned for

Student Teaching
Applications Now

Available for Fall 0

Students wishing to_ student
teach in the fall or winter tri-
mester, 1961-62, and who have
not previously applied, should ap-
ply immediately at the Office of
Student Teaching and Admissions.

Applicants must be enrolled in
the School of Education; however,
applications for admission to the
School of Education and student
teacher program may be filed
simultaneously. —

Prior to student teaching ap-
plicants must ‘have completed
Foundations of Education 101 and
Psychology 61. Those in element-
ary education must have a QPA
of 2.0, and those in other depart-
ments should have a QPA of ap-
proximately 2.5 in their teaching
fields.

For additionai inmrmation con-
cerning these regulations contact
the departmental representative
or the director of student teach-
ing on the 18th floor Cl.

Walter Kaufniann
Slated for Midday

Dr. Walter Kaufmann, Prince-
ton Associate Professor of Phil-
osophy, will open the Midday
Series on Jan. .18. He will speak
on “The Ethics of a Heretic.”

Born in Freiburg, Germany,
Walter Kaufmann is a graduate of
Williams College.

Dr. Kautmann was a Fulbright
resident- professor at Heidelburg
‘in 1955-56.

The guest speaker has vritten

or edited several well-known
philosophical books, including,
“Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psycho-

logist, Antichrist,” “The Portable
Nietzsche,” and “Existentialism
Dostoevsky to Sartre ”

 
 

°medium while providing valuable

training for student announcers
and broadcasters.

The first recent attempt was in
February of 1959. On the ninth
of that. month, following a long
period of planning, WPGH at
last seemed ready to go on the
air.

It might be more accurate to
say “on the wires,” for the station-
was to operate on a “wired-wire-
less” system under which broad-
casts would be beamed through
power lines to the area of the
eight buildings of the Schenley
Quadrangle. ‘

Companies Contribute

Local radio stations, particular-
ly‘ KQV, had~ donated approxi-
mately $2,000 worth of equipment
to the ﬂedging station. KDKA had
loaned the technical assistance of
their staff to train the student
broadcasters and engincers.

Record companies had con-
tributed records for disc-jockey
programs, and Campus Cleaners
and the Professional Book Store
had signed up for advertising
time.

When broadcast time arrived,
however, the attempt to use the
transmitter blew out all the lights
in Schenley House, and the sta-
tion was unable to broadcast.

‘ Expense too Great;

. . . ‘Not Worth It’

The 7070 computer would
be “too expensive” to be used
for registration and therefore
“not worth it,” according to
Richard Hodges, director of
Student Records.

Although he realizes that using
the computer would eliminate the
inevitable human errors involv-
ed in the present registration set-
up, Hodges insists that the time
and money consumed would not
make the job worthwhile.

“The job of making out a pro-
gram would be tremendously dif-
ficult and would require great
managing costs. In addition, it
would tie up the computer for

' too long, stopping alliother work
, during registration,” Hodges said.

He explained the obvious suc-
cess of registration by computers
at Purdue University by point-
ing out that most students there
take engin"ee_r‘i‘ng'” courses. The
rigid, engineering program makes
it. possible for the computer to
plan a student’s program given
only his engineering «field and
year. i

“This is nnpossible at the
University because of the varied
programs students take and be-
cause of the great number of
electives offered,” Hodges said.

Hodges added that although the
computer has not been used as
yet at the University, it will be
used to check classroom assign-
ments already made by the office
of Student Records for ‘the spring
term.

The computer will also be
used for analysis. It will calcu-
late the — percentage of time ‘a
classroom is in use. In addition
it will make enrollment and
grade-distribution studies.

“Registration rs continually be-
ing improved,” Hodges said. “Ap-
proximately 1200 changes will be
made_for this trimester, includ-

IBM 7070
Focal point of Problem...

ing course and time cnanges.

“Last trimester about one out
of every three students had
some change made on his‘sched-
ule, but this term only one out
of every ten has had a change. ,

“We try to honor all programs,
and follow the preregistration
schedules,” Hodges said, “but this
is not always possible. If a class
is ﬁlled, another is substituted. If
a course is closed, the schedule
is returned to the adviser and the
student concerned.

“I understand and sympathize
with those students whose class
times have been changed, but
not with those who continually
change their in i n d s about
courses because of the required
work, or because they fail to
meet the course requirements."

“A student should decide why
he is going to college, for what
degree, what courses he wants,
and he should stick to what he
decides.” ‘ . ‘

The problem of busy, ”over—
worked, uncompensated teacher-
advisers” will be solved this fall,
Hodges said. A group of trained
advisers who will be compensated
for their work should be ready to
take over.

Naughton States
Future Need Of

Computer’s Use

By Bonnie Rein

Use of the 7070 computer
for future
“completely feasible” and the
University “will eventually
have to use it,” Joe Naugh-
ton, system analyst at the
Computing Center, said recently.

According to Naughton, regis-
tration could be completely done

by this machine. “There is no
limit for the future.”

The machine would handle in-
formation regarding classes in
such a way as to eliminate class
conflicts and schedule changes.

, The computer will also keep
a complete and up-to-date ‘rec-
ord of each student. In this way,
the computer could serve as I
double check on a student's re-
quirements for either a speciﬁc
course or for graduation.

“The computer"s fantastic mem-’'

ory capacity, the incredible speed
at which it works and its eﬂicien-

cy, make the tremendously diffi-

cult programming worthwhile,"
he said..

‘Buckley Berates Liberal Trens

Lambasts Foreign
Policy, Gives Four
Point Program

By CHUCK DUNBAR

Liberalism is the enemy of
national security; the ulti-
mate meaning (if liberalism
the Americans predicts the
end of national security.
‘Such was the opinion of

’William F. Buckley. Jr., editor of

National Review magazine.

In his speech "Liberal Ideology
and American Foreign Policy”
sponsored by the Society for
Conservative Studies, Buckley put
his audience at ease with a few
anecdotes, and then proceeded to
lambast liberal foreign policy with
some powerful rhetoric.

Opening with a discussion of
Fidel Castro, Buckley posed the
question to the Student Union
audience, “Why are we threaten-
ed with Castro? Let us reflect on
a scene eighteen months ago at
Harvard University, when 10,000
members of the Harvard com-
munity gave him standing ova-
tion.”

Makes Proposals

Castro had been in power for
four months already, but the re-
gception at Harvard represents the
liberal feeling of the whole nation
toward this tyrant, from Buckley’s
viewpoint.

“Castro is only a minor
figure, but he is representative.
of our ability to deal with the
rest of the world. Our. liberal
policy has grown into a world-
wide force whose effects are
not only economic and social.
but philosophical.”

Buckley laid down four pro-

posals designed to shatter the lib-

eral approach to national secur-
ity. The first of these said “Na-
tional security is less effective by
the introduction of notions of
force. Force must be creditably
threatened to be useful.”
Criticizes Liberals
He went on to criticize the lib-
erals’ stand on pacifism. “Stu-
dents know nothing of the horrors
of pacifism,” he claimed. “Pacif-
ism is a Christian heresy which
from critical misunder-
standings.
“Yield, if you are prepared to
yield your honor, your life.”
“Students have a diluted loy-
alty to the West, which liberal-
ism has engendered. We must
win without war, but we must
win.” National security will not
be achieved through pacifism.
says Buckley.
His second proposal was that

national security is influenced by

a moralistic rhetoric that we
should act when we should not.
act. It is almost an axiom of for-
eign policy that nations should
be left. to their own affairs, an
axiom which Buckley feels the
U.S. misuses.

Blasts UN

Panama should be free as long
as her freedom is not detrimental
to our interests, says Buckley’s in-
terpretation of the liberal stand.

He shook the foundations of
the United Nations with a
blast at its idealistic structure.

He suggested turning it into
an amoral institution for more
effectiveness. “The survival of
civilized society is at stake in

our war with Communism.” It ‘

is not a matter of right or wrong.
His third point stated——-the de-
velopment of a nuclear arsenal
is necessary to the national se-
curity. “War is definitely pos-
sible,” said Buckley. It is his
belief that we must be prepared.
The fourth proposition ex-
tended the thought that the
ultimate meaning of, liberal-
ism for Americans means the
end of national security.

Buckley, if he achieved nothing
else, dispelled the image that
conservatives are a quiet, un-
asuming group of individuals who
are for the status quo and against
progress. ' ~

SCOTT KELLY, recently appointed to Assistant Director of OCEE,
plans programs for study abroad. One of his main goals is to
further international exchange of students and scholars and to en- ‘
courage students to visit foreign countries.

OCEE Planner

Works Wonder.

  For Travelers

gy CIIRISTINELUNDBERG
Scott Kelly, under the stag-
gering title of Assistant Di-

' rector of Cultural and Educa-

tional Exchange, is _a young
man who has, perhaps, one
of the most. interesting jobs at
our University.

He explains his goal as “an at-
tempt to further international ex-
change of students and scholars.”

This includes not only working.
with foreign students, but also
seeking to encourage and aid un-

dergraduates to travel and studyi

abroad,_ and -to mingle with the
foreign students on our own cam-
pus.
Co—ordinates Programs
One of the newest organizations

on campus, AIESEC, was begun

by Kelly only a month ago.

This organization makes possi-
ble on-the-job training in Europe
for Business and Commerce stu-
dents here, and offers the same
opportunity to students in Europe
to train in America. ,

Kelly also coordinates the Pitt
Abroad Program, the 1961 sum-
mer seminar for University
teachers in the Hague, Nether-
lands; and a group of thirty Tri-
state colleges working together
for international exchange stu-
dents. ‘

Hailing from the Blue-Grass
State, Kelly came to the Univer-
sity last September with a very
distinguished and diversiﬁed past.
After graduating from Hampden-
Sydney College in Virginia, he
went through the Naval Oﬂicers
Candidate School and was an of-
ficer for three years.

Studied in Europe

He received the degree of Mas-
ter of International Relations from
the University of Pennsylvania
and studied in Europe for two
years on a Fulbright Scholarship
Award.

Last year he wrote on foreign
aﬁairs for the United Press In-
ternational at Hartford, Conn.

When asked about hobbies _or
favorite activities, Kelly, leaning
back .in his swivel chair. grinned
and explained that he is now try-
ing to furnish his new ‘bachelor’
apartment.  , -

It’s election time again!
Students seeking positions as senators or ‘executives
of student government will soon be anxiously soliciting for

;‘ usupport. Yet if election procedures are patterned after the

past two elections, for students will notice the commotion
of any political group.

During those elections neither of the parties had plat-
forms that were either distinct or worthwhile. This re-
sulted in elections which were more like popularity con-
tests.

The accomplishments of the present student govern-

t ment will be the biggest drawback in the election this year-

_The effort made in holding meetings, making enthusiastic
speeches, keeping parliamentary procedure and forming
committee seems farcial to most students. One; can almost
expect fewer students to vote than the 817, who did last
year if someone does not do some research into what a stu-
dent government could be.

The people involved in student government this year

. I are not completely to blame, however; in fact the entire

student body with it lackadaisical attitude is _just as guilty.

 All of the Senate meetings have been open meetings at

which any student or group of students could have ex-
pressed themselves. 

’ If students would realize the intrinsic value of a stu-
dent government association as a tool to be used, this pres-
ent state of no interest groups‘ attending meetings would
not exist. _

Doubting students will ask what problems are there

“to be voiced to student government and what could be

done even if we did express themselves.

The continuous complaints voiced in this office by stu-
dents about various aspects of thetrimester, health facil-
-eities, parking problems, drinking regulations, unrealistic
faculty members . . . are just a few subjects.

What could be done—-well power lies with the major-
ity; student government will never have this power or reach
goals without the support of students.

Another reason for bringing these complaints or sug-

gestions out into the open is that administrators are as
concerned with them as much" as the stu_‘dent..How can one
alleviate the tensions facing a student or administrator if
one is not fully aware of the problems?
0 Students setting up parties or joining should consider a

Shades of Agee . .*.

By Ina Amdur

The names of Dachau, Hiroshima, or little Rock
bring to our minds the ubiquitous and omnipresent
problem of human suffering. We associate these

geographical names with the atrocities that have

taken place there. We pay hom-

ing hamburgers at the refresh-
ment stand near Dachau, by
daintily turning away while
watching movies which show the .
burnt skin of Japanese babies,
and by muttering false platitudes
about the lack of segregation in
the North.

We have lost that one irre-
placeable characteristic w h i c h
constitutes rebellion against the
human condition. Albert Camus has said, “I rebel,
therefore we exist.” It is rebellion against injus-
tice: which _may not even touch the person re-

belling, that constitutes the basis of human soli-S

darity. It is not “I rébel, therefore I exist,’.’ but “1
rebel, therefore we exist.”

We, at the university, have lost, or perhaps we
never possessed, the spirit of rebellion against the
injustice that is constantly brought to our attention.
This was clearly demonstrated by the administra-
tion and by the students last trimester when the
problem of discrimination on campus arose. A

towering indifference was displayed by most stu-
dents, and many refused to admit that discrimina-
tion, was a problem at all.

Practices Indifference

One may think that apathy about discrimination
cannot be compared with the greater injustices
mentioned above, but indifference is the common
element which makes them similar. Once a human
being stops rebelling and merely_resigns himself
to the spectacle of human. suffering, gradually he
becomes so indifferent that he accepts the most
tragic misuses of the human being with perfect and
practiced equanim.ity.

Most students and administration completely
failed to understand that the committee working
for a non—discriminatory policy on campus realized
that the real issue was not that against which they
were ostensibly ﬁghting. The real issue was the
growing apathy on the part of the human race
toward the condition of their fellow men. The soft
calls of the human conscience have been put down
for so long that they have now ceased to trouble us.

Some have not permitted their consciences to

Will It Register? . . .

Friend or Foe ?
 S By Chuck Dunbar

- As ‘is customary, registration has ended and
weary students have crawled -off to recuperate from
the battles fought during this hectic time. Now
that it is al1.over, let us sit back and examine our
mistakes. V i

Was all this effort necessary? This should in-
deed be the ﬁrst question to ask
of ourselves. Whispers in the
Cathedral spread the rumor that
the new IBM 7070 computer is at
fault. It was not. It had little
or nothing to do with scheduling.

But it could have. According
to statements by Joe Naughton,
systems analyst at the computer
center, the mechanized brain will

Then think of the eﬁiciency we

» will have. Just pick your classes
and the hours in which you are able to attend
classes and presto -— the 7070 scrambles all the
numbers in its .memory drum and out comes a

_,perfect schedule. ,

' Speed Incorporated

Why, registration could then be conducted en-
tirely by mail, with the least possible effort. Hard
to believe; well, look what it did in the way of
turning out grade reports. In the past, grades took
weeks to compile and mail; the computer per-
formed the task in less than aday.

remain unheard. James Agee appointed himself as
a public conscience when he in collaboration with
Walker Evans, a photographer, wrote Let Us Now
Praise Famous Men. It is the story of three fami-
lies of sharecroppers in the South; it is the “reso-
lute, private rebellion” of those who wrote it. Any
attempt to paraphrase what Agee says would be
self—defeating, because what he says is inseparable
from how he ‘says it.

In several paragraphs scattered throughout the
book he compels the reader to understand what it
means to rebel and what it means to suffer. These

must be repeated for those who _will_ never read «

the « book. Perhaps then it will be clear exactly
what the larger issues of any rebellion, on campus
or not, are’:

“I believe that every human being is potentially
capable, within his \lim'its, of fully realizing his
potentialities; that this, ’ his being cheated and
choked of it, is inﬁnitely the ghastliest, commonest,

and most inclusive of all the crimes of which the '
human world can accuse itself; and that the dis- 

covery and use of ‘consciousness,’ which has always
been and is our deadliest enemy and deceiver is
also the source and guide of all hope and cure and
thelonly one . . .”

Agee Speaks Out . 

“In every child who is born, under no matter
what circumstances and of no matter what parents,
the potentiality of the human race is born again;
and in him, too, once more,‘and.of each of us our

terriﬁc responsibility towards human life; towards "
the utmost idea of goodness, of the horror of error, 0‘ V

and of God . . .”

‘ In the following paragraph the “she” of whom
Agee is speaking is a woman Isharecroppert
“And how is this to be made so real to you
who read it .——— that it will stand and stay in you as l
the deepest and most iron anguish and guilt of
your existence that you are what you are, and that
she is what she is, and that you cannot for one

Tmoment exchange places with her, nor by any such

hope make expiation for What she has suffered at
your hands, and for what you have gained at hers:
but only by consuming all that is in you into the
never relaxed determination that this shall be
made different and shall be made right, and that
of what is “right” some, enough to die for, is clear
already, and the vast darkness of the resthas’ still,
and far more passionately and more skeptically
than ever before, to be questioned into, defended,
and learned. toward.” .

would shortly achieve a Utopia ‘of registration.
After all, as far .as the University is concerned, the ‘ P

. computer is largely wasted. Its valuable memory‘

is sub-leased to private industry around the area

at $200 per__hou_r, which is “chicken feed” com- __
pared to what the school could ask andhget for the I

70'70’s services. _ —

But,‘ as the old axioml says--L“Youl can’t get -

anything for nothing.” With the good would come
the bad. Of course, a_ choice of teacher would be
eliminated, as well as choice of hours. We would
wake up some morning and find our very moves
dictated to us by the monster on the eighth floor.

Freedom Dies

Richard Hodges, director of the Office -of Student
Records, seems to be, the-, chief proponent of the
measure which feels the best policy would be to
throw a monkey wrench into the 7070. We should
side with him, for with the adventjof computed

Judo Instructor Explains

History of ‘The Gentle Art’ I

By PAUL WILSON
“Master judo and you’ll fear no man.” These were the
.. words of Chuck Katz, sophomore instructor of the University

- Judo Club. The club meets weekly to study the techniques

of judo. It is hoped that, in the future,ractual competition

will be started.
J_udo, which means “the
ancient Japanese sport, Jiu-Jitsu.

gentle art,” arose from the

In 1882, Dr. Jigoro Kano, super-
intendent of the Japanese school
system, observed that jiu-jitsu
had fallen into disrepute with the
increasing use of guns and other
firearms.

The students of the sport had
taken to disjointing the jaws of
"passer-by’s ‘to keep in practice.
These jaws were reset in the Jiu-
jitsu schools —- for a price!

Develops Sport 1

Kano developed his judo as a
sport’ rather than a means of de-
fenseand opened his own school,
Kodokan. In 1886, be defeated the
judolexperts of his day.

Kano had two mottoes; “Mu-
tual Welfare and Benefit,’ and
“Maximum Efficiency with
Minimum Effort.” ‘He. stressed
perserverance and did much to
strengthen the other life of his
students.

In the beginning there were ten
students in Kodokan; today the

choke hold on him in such a
manner that he must submit

In 1952, the American Athletic
Union recognized judo as 2 com-
petitive sport. This is in sharp
contrast to karate, another out-
growth of Jiu-jitsu, which is a
deadly defense art involving the
hands and feet.

An expert in karate can break
a brick in half by a single chop
with the edge of his hand. Some
have been known to kill bulls in
this manner. Anyone for a nice
game of checkers?

Book Exchange
Proves Successful

Total business done by the stu-
dent government book exchange
exceeded four times the amount
done last trimester.

“This is a tremendous improve-
ment which certainly seems to
justify our move from that one
small room in the Cathedral to
the ﬁve rooms in’ Schenley Hall
that we used this trimester,” said
Jay Fingeret, chairman of the
book exchange.

Numerically speaking, 425 of
the 650 books taken in were sold.
Among the best sellers were,math
22, geography 51, anthropology 1,.
economics 1 and psychology 3.

. Two books which did not sell at

all were biology 22 and sociology

The reason for this was that the
University Book Store no longer
carries these books so that the
book exchange was obliged not
to sell them.

To Give Premiere ;
Program Thursday

Dutch violinist Kees Koop-
er and American
Mary Louise Boehm will
open the University P. M.
Series for this trimester in
a duo-recital of contempor-
ary Dutch music on Thursday at
8:30 p.m. in the SU supper room.

Before coming to the United
States, Kooper was considered one
of the major violinists in his na-
tive Holland. He made‘his debut
in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw
in 1949 and received a standing
ovation.

Miss Boehm, a native of Iowa,
made her debut in Chicago at the
age of 18. Under the guidance of
master pianists Robert Casadesus
and VVz*lt-‘r Gieseking, she reached
full artistic maturity and has con-

certized extensively in the United
States and in Europe.

The two artists met on the
concert stage in Paris and were
married three years later. They
continue their separate careers
as soloists bu.t have also com-
bined their talents in joint re-
citals and in cahber music with
great success.

The New York Times comment-
ed that Kooper is “an important
new talent -in the violin ﬁeld. He
plays with an eloquence not often
encountered in our concerlhalls

)3
.o.

Miss Boehm, “a formidable tal-
ent, demonstrated powerful tech-
nique in her solo number, Schu-
rnann’s Etudes Symphoniques.”

In their concert here, Kooper
and Miss Boehm will jointly
perform Sonata in G major by
Hendrick Fucking; Sonata for
violin and piano by Julius Hij-
man; and Sonata No. 2 for vio-
lin and piano by William Pijer.

Kooper will present Sonata for
violin solo by Honk Badings, and
Miss Boehm will play Sonata No.

B<othTeam—sl—l-ndefeated;
Panthers Rip Syracuse

By TED COLTON
This afternoon at the Field House Rex Peery’s matmen
will have a two-fold purpose in mind when they tangle with
the Wolverines of Michigan. One, they will be trying to keep
their perfect record intact (2-0) and two, they will be seek-
ing revenge over the team that handed them their only de-

feat last year. .

l\'l2:tch time is slated for 3 p.m.0 “-*‘*'“‘““‘"“

The Panthers will be wrestling
tor the second time in three days
when they meet Michigan today.
Saturday, the Blue and Gold down-
ed Syracusc. 28-3, in a warm-up
tilt for tough Michigan.

The matmen from the Big Ten
provide a formidable foe for
Peery's grapplcrs. They have four
Big Ten champions and are rated
third in the country, one notch
ahead of the Panthers.

Undefeated Teams

Both teams will put undefeated
records on the line with Michigan
having one more match than the
Panthers. Earlier in the year the
two teams participated in the
Wilkes Barre tournament. The
Panthers won the titl.c 66 to 49,
with the Wolverines ﬁnishing sec-
ond. Miehigan. however, didn’t
have a full team in the tourney.

Fritz Kellerman. Jim Blavkelk
Don C-orriere and Dennis Fitz-
gerzld are the Wolverine four
Big Ten champs. Kellerman
has a 2-0 record and will prob-
ably meet Larry Lauchle in the
130 pond class. Last year Kel-
lerman was pinned by the Pan-
thers’ Daryl Kelvington.

Blaker will face John Zolinkoﬁ
at 147. This will be a rematch
from last year. When Zolinkolf
captured a 3-2 victory.

Undecided Line-up

Corriere did not wrestle against
the Panthers last year but already
posted three wins. Fitzgerald has
a 2-1 record.

ine‘s lineup willlbe Nick Ar-
melagos at 123, Wilfred Hilde-

Sollinger Sets Two

Swim. ming Records

The Panther mermen splashed
their way to a 55-40 victory over
Lehigh while setting four new rec-
ords for the aquatic Cats.

Sophomore Panther Jerry Soil-
inger had his share of glory as ‘he
set two new individual marks and
was also a member of a record
breaking relay team.

Only last Saturday Sollinger
broke the record for the 200-yard
backstroke and against Lehigh
Sollingerls 12:18.8 was .2 seconds
under the mark set last week.

In the first leg of the 400-yard
medley relay, Sollinger swam the
100-yard backstroke in 1:01.6,
breaking the previous mark set
by Willis Weisz in 1959. Carl
Warnes, Tony Sarsfield, and
Dick Rush ﬁnished up the relay
in a record setting 4:03 time,
breaking the old mark ‘of 4:1’1.1.

In the 200-yard butterﬂy, the
Panther’s Tony Sarsﬁeld set a new
mark of 2:22 erasing Ron Gains-
ford‘s record from the books.

“Both Sollinger and Sarsﬁeld
have come along well this season
and Saturdays p e r f o rm a n c e
proved this,” commented Coach
Grady. “In fact, the whole team
seems to be coming along quite
well." '

Revenge was what Panther gym

revenge indeed was what McCon-
nell got in an otherwise dismal

gymnastics
Cats were trounced by Navy 66-30
in their opening contest of the sea-
son at the Field House last Satur-
day afternoon before a crowd of
some 500.

McConnell, who lost the Eastern
tumbling championship t.o Navy's
Joe Marshall by 1/2 point at Tem-
ple last March, beat Marshall in a
nip-and-tuck battle 181-177 to the
delight of the partisan crowd who
thought McConnell had won by a
wider margin.

Judge Louis Bordo didn't arrive
until the meet was half over and
thus only two judges, Harvey Le-
collier and Harry Dippold, worked
the tumbling, side horse and high
bar events.

Panther First

As the result of doing the ﬁrst -

double back-summersault in Pan-
ther gym history, and also a full
twist, McConnell gained his re-
ven over Marshall whose most
difficult jtrick was afi double. twist

. Coach VVarren Neiger, the
Panthers’ gym tutor, agreed 100

per cent with the two judges’
decision. “Earl was even a bit
too high on his double, but his
full twist and front work were

convincingly," ‘Neiger replied.

Marshall showed that he‘ was a
true champ after the meet by de-
claring, “I realize that the judges
will usually vote for a man if he
is a defending Eastern champion,
but after Earl hit his double I
thought it would be a crime if the
judges didn’. give it to him.”

' Record Set

The tumbling triumph was the
only bright spot for the Cats as
the Middies swept the other ﬁve
ﬁrsts and also took each event.
Nelson Hulme, Navy’s defending
EIGL and NC&& rope titlist, took
the rope with a time of‘3.5 sec-
onds, a new Field House record.

Other ﬁrst place winners for
Coach Chet Phillips’ Navy squad
included Joe Maiden on the side
horse, Bruce Krueger on the
high bar, Cecil Tune on the par-
allel bars and Van Temple on
the ﬂying rings. The Middies
also took four seconds.

Besides McConnell, other good
Panther performances were turned
in by Joe Battaglia and Jack Leh-
ner on the ﬂying rings,_Ed Zamec-

nik on the high bar" and Ron:
Daugherty’s 4.1 time on the rope,

the best ever turned in by the

Blue and Gold climber. ,

Despite six first places the Pan-
thers gained in the indoor battle,
Navy garnered many seconds and
thirds and had little trouble de-
feating their visitors.

Harry Stokes, top Panther
sprinter, gained first place in the
600-yard run posting a time of
1:125. Vance Carter clipped the
1000—yard run in 2:13.8 for a win
in that event. Bob Shanefelt’s 6:5

seconds in the 60-yard dash won

that event.

Ed Sherlock tied Navy’s Dave
Thaxton in the high jump at‘6
feet three inches.
won the broad jump with a leap
of 22 feet 163/; inches. The only
other Panther winner was Ron
Weirs who took honors in the
pole vault at 13 feet.

Three Navy records were broken

Saturday as Jud Sage tossed the
35-pound weight 59 feet; Dick
Brown put the shot 56 feet six

ered the mile in 4:23.3.

Poor Shooting L

Cost Cagers
7th Victory

By JIM O'BRIEN
A crowd of 5219 fans pack-

ed the Field House Saturday
night for the Scoreboard
Fund triple-header for Chil-
dren’s Hospital and was treat-

ed to two hectic basketball”

frays and then slowly filtered
from their seats as Westminister
drubbed the Panthers in a real
“Cha1‘ity" contest, 76-51.

Trying for their fifth victory in
a row, the Panthers raced off to
a 14-7 early margin, but the vis-
itors gathered momentum faster
than Silky Sullivan ever could
muster on the racetrack, and swept
by the Cats. going from a 16-9‘ de-
ﬁcit to a 35-19 lead. They scored
15 points while “whitewashing"
the losers.

"They outfought us,” Don Hen-
non. assistant coach, sighed. This
more or less echoed the same sen-
timents of Head Coach Timmons:
“We didn’t have the right mental
attitude. The boys weren't taking
this game seriously.”

Poor ‘Ball Handling

Poor passing, which has stig-
matized the Cats all season, proved
their downfall. “We threw four
passes in the latter part of the
first half that they intercepted."
Timmons explained. “That’s eight

points right there, plus the fact '

that we were loafing on r3_e,.<;_;-5593*

In a surprise move. Coach
Buzz Ridl employed a tight
zone defense which arrested all
Panther scoring hopes. “I took
a gamble,” Ridl remarked. “We
only worked on that defense
1351 night. but we hustled and
it worked."

This was unique in View of the
fact that only last week Timmons
remarked that Westminster would
use a man-to-man defense, then
he smiled when commenting on
the ‘nanner in which Ben Jinks &
Co.- bombarded the nets against

9

Syracuse who used that pattern. ‘‘

“I read about that,” Ridl said,
“and it worried me. We have used
a zone against Pitt in the past and
it didn’t work, but they were
taller and we had to.”

Shifting defenses nearly every
night, the Titans became the
toast of the N. A. I. A. cham-
pionships. at Kansas City last
year. The zone enabled the New
Wilmington boys to even the re-
bounding allotment also. They
gathered 43 and the Cats gar-
nered 47.

The Titans produced more fruit-
ful results from their board sweep-
ing resources than the losers.
however. They worked the fast
break to perfection.

Besides countless other mental
lapses, the Panthers probably
maintained their lofty. unenvied
position of fourth place in the
NCAA statistic column for person-
al fouls. Their awkwardness cost-
the Cats 23 infractions.

Wrestling Tops-
ri Competitive
Sports

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

VVrestling is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting specta-
"‘ tors sports in the country. In the East with such schools as Penn
° State. Lehigh and Cornell and in the mid-west with schools like Ok-
lahoma, Iowa and Oklahoma State showing the way more and more

fans are beginning to show up at the wrestling matches.

For the uneducated sport fan we would like to point out the
scoring system and give \a general description of collegiate wrestling.
In the first place any resemblance between college wrestling and that
shown on TV is purely coincidental.

The exhibitions put on TV are simply that: "an exhibition. It is
rehearsed and acted out to the letter. College wrestling, on the other
hand, is hand to, hand combat between two individuals who are tight-
ing for, their team, themselves and their school. «Football, basketball,

‘baseball, etc.,.are good competitive sports but none of them can
match the competition that is involved in wrestling. ,.

When‘ a wrestler is out on the mat there is no turning back, no
teammate to help him if he makes a mistake and nobody to rely on
but himself and what he has been taught by his coach. It .is an in-
dividualistic sport yet a match lost by one wrestler may cost his
team a dual meet victory or even the Eastern or National champion-

ship.

Wrestling matches are scored this way: two points are award-
ed for a takeclown (when one wrestler is able -to put the other
wrestler on the mat and still have a commanding position) and a

* reversal (when both wrestlers are on the mat and the wrestler who
AV‘; does not have commanding position is able to get it by reversing
his opponent).

- One point is awarded for an escape (gettinguayvay from an op-
ponent) and a predicament (putting the opponent on his back with
his shoulders near the mat) and three points are awarded for a
near—fall (putting the opponent’s shouldge,,1j,>.close to the mat or hav-
ing them on the mat for less than the three seconds required for
iafpin.) The ultimate goal of co_urse is to get a pin (both shoulders
‘\on the mat for three seconds),

Team scoring goes this way; two points are awarded each team
if there is a tie, three points to the team that scores a win by a
decision and five points for a pin.

, Another interesting fact about the sport of. wrestling is that it
requires top physical conditioning. Ask any coach who the best
conditioned athletes are and they will tell you the wrestlers.

Besides being in top physical shape the matman has to put up
with another, shall we say inconvenience. He has to watch his
weight. Two years ago Pitt had a 157 pound wrestler who the year
before was wrestling in the heavyweight division. The Monday after
a Saturdays meet he would sometimes be ten to 20 pounds over-
weight, yet he always managed to get back down to 157 by match
"time.

4-» ‘ At the Easterns that year he had to take his teeth out to make
the weight. This year Daryl'Kelvington is the man who is“doing the
least eating. Before, the Wilkes Barre tourney the 137 pounder tipped
the scales at something like 155 pounds, yet he made the weight
for the holiday tournament.

When a wrestler is required to make a weight this means many
nights of just jello for supper.,For'a hungry athlete jello can become
pretty distasteful. When a wrestler decides to break training he runs
off somewhere to indulge in a thirst quenching coke.

Rexl Peery is perhaps the best wrestling coach in the country.
Since coming to Pitt his overallrecord is 90-27-2. This year the Pan-
thers are ranked fourth in the; nation. Lehigh and Penn State look

1 like the teams to beat in the Eas-t while Michigan (the matmen meet
Michigan today at the Fielil House S23 p.m.) looks like the toughest
intersectional rival. The Wolverines are third in the national ratings.

Out of the three teams mentioned above Lehigh looks like the
best. Already they have defeated Penn State, 24-8, Cornell 27-0, and
‘Iowa State, 22-8. For the Lehigh-Penn State match a crowd of 7400
"watched. 6000 attended the match and 1400 viewed over closed-
circuit TV. For Cornell a crowd of nearly 4000 sat in.

The Panthers will have a good chance of beating Lehigh with
‘Dick Martin, Larry Lauchle, Kclvington and John Zolikofi return-
ing undefeated from iast year’s team. Bob Guzik and Jim Harrison
give Peery two more boys who could post victories. But Lehigh 15
a long way off and right now Peery is worrying about Michigan, 21
team which handed the Panthers their only loss of the season last
year. Tonight the matmen will be out for revenge.

not have the 191 pound division.

The Panthers’ line-up will pro-
bably be decided while the match
is in progress. Dick Martin,
Lauchle, Kelvington, Zolinkoﬁ,
Jim Harrison and Bob Guzik have
all posted two victories but where
they will be placed against Michi-
ganiwil] depend on who wins the
early bouts.

‘Possible Starters
J Other possible wrestlers for the
‘Panthers could be Harry Dick,
Dave Osmun, Augie Arrigone and
Chuck Shaffer.

Against Syracuse the Cats
had very little trouble. Martin
decisioned Larry Nealson, 2-1,
and Lauchle piled ‘up a 13-2
score. Osmun, wrestling for the
first time, won easily, 6-2, and
Zolikoﬂ, along with Guzik, won
by default.

Kelvington went up two weight
classes, to 157. and gained a 6-1
decision over Don Dunning. Har-

The Panthers only loss came in

To Attempt Again

(Continued from Page I)
WPGH, explained that the fail-
ure_ was caused by a faulty trans-
mitter.

A later attempt with a war
surplus transmitter, which the
students bought second-hand and
worked on in their spare time,
was slightly more successful. .

After a couple weeks of op-

' er-ation, however, the equip-

, ment suffered ,a gradual loss of
power which again forced the
station to suspend operations.

The personnel and advisors of
WPGH will meet next week to
consider the fate of the project.

Until now the difficulties en-
countered have been purely of a’
technical nature. Student, faculty,
and departmental support has not
been lacking.

Dick Rauh, the current general
manager, and Irwin Hilk, person-
nel manager, have devoted con-
siderable time trying to track
down the exact nature of these
difficulties.

Apparently a large part of the
trouble lies in the construction
of the StudentUnion building.
Rauh and Hilk conducted a
room-by—room survey of the
entire quadrangle area, and
found great differences in re-
ception between various floors
and buildings.

A further source of difficulties
may be the electrical wiring sys-
tem of Schenley House, which ap-
parently is not well adapted for
carrier current broadcasting.

,THE ENGINEERS HAVE HAIRY EARS

Today in this age of technology when engineering graduates
are wooed and courted by all of America’s great industries, how
do you account for the fact that Rimbaud Sigafoos, who ﬁn-
ished at- the Very top of his class at M.I.T., turned down hun-
dreds of attractive job offers to acceptemployment as a machin-
ery wiper at the Acme Ice Company at a salary of $20 a week
with a twelve-hour day, a seven-day week, and only ﬁfteen
minutes for lunch? .
I know what you are thinking: “Cherchez la femme!’’‘ You are
thinking that Mr. Acme, head of the Acme Ice Company, has
’a beautiful daughter with whom Rimbaud is madly in love and
he took the job only to be near her.
Friends, you are wrong. It is true that Mr. Acme does have
a daughter, a large, torpid lass named Claudia who spends all
her waking hours scooping marzipan out of a bucket and staring
at a television set which has not worked in some years. Rimbaud

has not the slightest interest in Clavdia; nor, indeed, does any -

other man, excepting possibly John Ringling North.
So how come Rimbaud keeps working for the Acme Ice
Company? Can it be that they provide him with free Marlboro

~ Cigarettes, and all day long he is able to settle back, make

himself comfortable and enjoy theiﬁlter cigarette with the un-
ﬁltered tastc? -

 

No, friends, no. Rimbaud isnotvallowed to smoke on the job
and when he finishes his long, miserable day he has to buy his
own Marlboros, even as you and I, in order to settle back and
enjoy that choice tobacco, that smooth, mellow ﬂavor, that in-
comparable ﬁlter, that pack or box.

Well, friends, you might as well give up because you’ll never

A ina million years guess why Rimbaud works for the Acme Ice
‘ Company. The reason is simply’ this: Rimbaud is a seal!

He started as a. performing seal in vaudeville. One night on
the way to the Ed Sullivan show, he took the wrong subway.

All night the poor mammal rode the B.M.T., seeking ahelping -

hand. Finally a kindly brakeman named Ernest Thompson
_Sigafoos rescued the hapless Rimbaud’.

He took Rimbaud home and raised him as his own, and
Rimbaud, to show his appreciation, studied hard and got ex-
cellent marks and ﬁnished a distinguished academic-career as
Valedictorian of M.}.T.

Rimbaud never complained to his kindly foster father, but
through all those years of grammar school and high school and
college, he darn near died of the heat! A seal, you must re-
member, is by nature a denizen of the Arctic, so you can im-
agine how ‘poor Rimbaud must have suffered in subtropical

. New York" and Boston, esp‘ec'ia.1ly in those tight Ivy League

suits. _
today at the Acme Ice Company, Rimbaud has ﬁnally
found a temperature to his liking. He is very happy and sends

greetings toliis many friends.
