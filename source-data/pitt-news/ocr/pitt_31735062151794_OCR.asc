John T. Flynn Notes
LGreat Activity In City
Declares Government Spending Has Been Responsible;

Says Next War Will Show Right-Left Alignment
In Lecture At Community Forum Monday

 

By IRVING BENNETT
John T. Flynn, prominent newspaper columnist and writer
on economics, came to Pittsburgh yesterday to deliver several
addresses, one of them at Inquiry Forum, and-found a pulsat-
ing, activity-conscious city in contrast to the stricken, paralyzed

metropolis he had found four years ago.

was undoubtedly rebounding.

Pittsburgh, he said,

Mr. Flynn arrived too late for his Inquiry Forum engage-

ment, but he did lecture before the<

YMHA and Community Forum. This
writer approached him after his lee‘-
ture at Community Forum, and
found a ready, willing talker. _

The reason business is improving,
according to Mr. Flynn, is that the
government has spent money. Mr.
Roosevelt has spent eighteen billion
as opposed to the three million of
Mr. Hoover. This eighteen billion has
been responsible for the increase in
business activity, although about.ten
million of it has found its way into
savings’, banks, where, claims Mr.
Flynn, its valu-e——and he could prove
it by m-ore ﬁgures-—is nil.

Declaring the modern world “war
crazy," Mr. Flynn looked toward the
future. The present Neutrality Act
coming up for renewal in May is
threatened by the President, he points
out, who wants to make the pr0VlSl0l'lS
discretionary rather than mandatory.
Thus, in the event of war, the chief

‘Wolfy’ Recalls Past

In Current Interview

Cafeteria Manager Tells About Former Eating Places
On University Campus From First Lunch Stand.
Set Up In 1910 To Present Dining Room

By Irene Long

Little Red Riding Hood and the
three little pigs almost got et up by
a wolf; innocent pedestrians are pur-
sued by howling wolves on the Steppes
of Russia; but we tripped up the
steps of the University Pharmacy
School to discover two very swell
Wo1fes——Mr. and Mrs. Herman L.
Wolfe, who manage the cafeteria
there.

While in search of Mr. and Mrs.
Wolfe, we got lost. Some of our
brother Pitt Newsers, on their way
to the printers, dropped us off on
the Boulevard of the Allies at what
they absolutely assured us was the
Pharmacy School. However, “We
have no Mr. Wolfe here; this is the
Mercy Hospital Nurses’ Home; and
the Pitt Pharmacy School, young
lady,” snapped a grim. starched, Ed-
113 May Oliverisli-looking female, “is

next door!" We grinned, hitched up
our ankle sox, and departed there-
from, making a mental note that cer-
tain Pitt Newsers are sad cases!

Entering the School of Pharmacy
we braved many miles of nice
young gentlemen to inquire as to
Mr. Wolfe’s whereabouts.

“Whaddya mean—Mister Wolfe?
Call ’im Herman!” shouted a freckled
boy lying on a bench with his feet
propped up in the air.

“Do you?” said we.

“Yes! We all do ’round here," was
the general acclamation.

And that is a good introduction tc
the happy-go-lucky Mr. Wolfe, when:
many University graduates have al
ways known as “Wolfy.” Too, there
is the kindly Mrs. Wolfy,” who ha‘
always worked along with her hus-
band. The genial couple have a smile

College Association Breaks
Precedent In Planning
Combined Meeting

College Association's annual as-
sembly, an organization meeting of
all students in the College, will be
open to all University ‘students, ac-
cording to Dr. Omar C. Held, person-
nel assistant to the Dean and faculty
director of the undergraduate associa-
tion.

The meeting, scheduled for January
15 in Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall, shifts emphasis from the original
purpose of the annual assembly, i. e.,
in the aim to unite students in the
College as a distinct division of the
University with the decision to ex-
tend an invitation to the various other
schools.

Students in the College will be ex-
cused from the fourth hour classes,
11:30 to 1.2:30 o'clock, one week
from Friday for the event. Promi-
nent district and University leaders
who will address the affair will be
announced at a later date. It is also
planned to include several undergrad-
uate speakers, and other features in
the program.

Evelyn Lowy, ’38 Cabinet member,
has been working as general chair-
man for the assembly, assisted by
Leah Goldstein, ’39, and Nathan
Schwartz, ’38, Cabinet members.

A Cabinet meeting of the College
Association has been called for to-
morrow evening at 7 o’clock at 4727
Baum Blvd. Reports on the Thanks-
giving formal, loan fund, and plans
for the annual Assembly will be dis-
cussed at that time.

Leyton, Shapiro Argue
On Labor Question

At Heinz House at 3:30 o’clock
this afternoon two members of the
Women's Debating Association of the
University will appear in a debate
with two members of the women’s
varsity debating squad from Bates
College, Lewistown, Maine.

Marcella Leyton, C37, and Ruth
Shapiro, C37, have been chosen to
support the negative side of the ques-
tion: “Resolved, That Congress Shall
Have the Power to Regulate Mini-
mum Wages and Maximum Hours 111
Industry.”

Miss Leyton and Miss Shapiro were
recently initiated into Delta Sigma
Rho, national honorary debating fra-
ternity. The women from the Lew-
istown college squad are also mem-
bers of Delta Sigma Rho. ‘

Members of the association are in-
viting all students to attend the de-
bate. At 6 o’clock they will enter-
tain the visiting squad and members
of the freshman speech unit at a
dinner in Heinz House.

The women from way up north.
making a 1,900-mile tour to colleges
and universities in Ohio and Penn-
sylvania, will also appear at Penn
State, Ohio State, Ohio Wesleyan,
Wooster College, Western Reserve
and Allegheny College.

Although this is the first time that
a Bates squad has appeared in Ohio,
long trips are not new to the Bates
College team. Bates men have been
around the world once and to Eng-
land three times. In 1934 a squad
made an extensive tour of Canada
and in 1935 of Florida.

Exclaim: Bitterlyp
Over Night in Jail

 

By Ray Maclntyre
Simply because we dare not -,te‘:1l
you his name, we shall Acall the man
Spike.

A wagon.

Notices. 

will be held’ on Wednesday at 12:30 

Spike happens to be a Pitt lhan,
land he with two of his friends were
on the occasion of New Year’s Eve
browsing harmlessly enough in and
about thevicinity of Oakland

Now Spike wants it perfectly un-
derstood that he was not drunk. But
woefully enough, one of his friends
was, and this particular friend, whom
for our purpose we shall call Mike,
was feeling pretty tough about it and
thought he’d take it out on the cor-
rfer blinker.

Pummel, Pummel! A

Mike forthwith proceeded to pum-
mel said blinker, and after due course,
Spike and his sober friend. thought
common decency;_«compelled them to
do something about it. They ad-
vanced on Mike with a Purpose.

Mike was adamant. He kept‘ on
pummelling, occasionally, it seems,
mistaking one of his remonstrating
friends for the blinker.“ A

Things do happen at the most in-
opportune "times. A, police patrol
would come along at such a moment.
It did. And the burly oﬁicers of'the
law summarily packed Mike into the
Spike.wanted.to know where the
oﬂicers were taking his friend.

“Wise guy, eh?” said one blue-
coat. “Well, mebbe ye’d like t’come
along, and then y’d know.” ‘

A '1 Object!’ A A

Spike went along, and so» did his
sober friend, and all the reasonable
objections they could think .,f didn’t
do them any good. Those policemen
were detenmined cusses. A

‘_‘A -jail is a hell of a place,” re-
ports Spike. “We met some nice
people there, -though: a couple of
wifebeaters, and some lovely drunks.”

Spike and his sober friend -stood up
all night. There was a single bench
in the place, and it was too dirty to
sit on. Mike sat on theﬂoor.

Spike telephoned home. _"'Hel[o,
mamma. PM be home in‘ the morn-
ing- l’l| explain it all then."

Later. ‘:1 group of Pi Lame came
in looking for :1 stolen car and said,
“Hi Spike."

In the morning a. policeman came
in and said, “Happy New Year.”

Next day, Magistrate Papale, after
hcaring Spike and his sober friend
explain what happened.‘ azlmittcd
they had been done a great wrong
and let them all go.

A “Wolfy” first set up a lunch stand
inAthe present School of Pharmacy
building in 1910. In those days the
Schools of Dentistry and Medicine
were also housed there, and the pro-
spective sody"-jerkers, tooth-yankers
and bone-setters obtained nourish-
ment and encouragement at the little
lunch stand.

In 1912, a cafeteria was set up on
the campus "in what is the present
University bookstore. Thaw Hall had
just been completed at that time and
the carpenter wasmoving his supplies
from the bookstore. Through the in-
ﬂuence of Dean» _F‘1'ir-rsell of the
School of, Dentistry, Wolfe was
given permission by the late Dr.
Samuel B. Linhart to set up a cafe-
teria. in the building. Fro-m 1912
until 1920 “Wolfy” managed his
cafeteria on the campus, retaining his
business in the School of Pharmacy

All decks seem to be cleared for the solution
of the most pertinent issue of the day, neutral-
ity legislation for the United States. The usual
type of legislation is being pushed into the back-
ground as the nation’s spotlight shines on our
531 Congressmen. Never before in the history of

 the nation has there been such serious consid-
~. oration given to neutrality. The present neutral-

ity expires in 1937,rand int. addition it has been
found ineffective, especially in regard to ship-

THE PITT Nr;.WS

E.“

ation Congress will likely turn its attention to
-he solution of our most pressing domestic prob-
lems. The “forrzotten man” of our present eco-
nomic system, the farmers and the unemployed,
re...-i.-"c c;..ciisi=.=c consideration from this
«..o.:grcss. Secretary Wallace, one of the
_*ea.tc;:t .5-.i'.~_.as in the country. is striving to re-
“Ltii; i 15-" i‘iI.£'IT-CPS and to raise their stand-
‘rds tr '...e f;‘.?1.9.‘ -cs-.»‘ci mainly through resettle-
zient l‘i"3_l€-Zi_S .'-3-:i*.(i sensible crop control. He is
like’~- 0-» "~-rrressioiial sanction for new
projects, in addition to commendation for his
 o)0l‘l as Congress has dis-

posed of neutrality.

Also slated for early consideration are cer-
tain measures aiming to assist American work-
ingmen to gain better conditions of employment
speciﬁcally legislation resurrecting the best fea
tures of the NRA. and including legislation to
assist in collective bargaining. The tremendous
sentiment behind the President in the last cam
paign is most certainly to be reflected in progres-
sive labor legislation.

All these, and many other measures which will
face this new Congress are not beyond the con-
sideration of University students. We will be the
Congressmen of future Congresses. We will be
the labor leaders, and the leaders of the farmers,
perhaps even the unemployed. We will help to
“run the country” in the future. and all of us are
concerned with the proceedings of the Seventy-
Fifth Congress. History is being written!

Moronic Holidays  

ANY UNIVERSITY students showed deﬁ-
nite moronic symptoms with their loud pro-
tests of “Gyp!” "We wuz robbed!” and equally
intelligent phrases since the beginning of the
new school year. It all came about over Pitt's
first Rose Bowl triumph, and the subsequent
urge for a holiday of celebration.

There was no need for a holiday. Agreed,
the team should receive a ﬁne welcome “Home,”
but the need for celebration ended with that
last hangover headache of New Year's Eve.

When the University‘ authorities cooperated,
even to assume the irnmediate initiative by dc-
claririg a -holiday parade leading up to a team-
welcoming assembly, there was a misinterpreta-
tion. Some students immediately had the idea
that the way to secure an education is to shorten
the periods between holidays as much as possible
by initiating more holidays.‘ They wanted a
full ‘day of revelery, with no classes.

Long ago we reached a capacity for that sort
of thing and the trend should now be to curtail

P1'rTPoUIuu

By The Scamp:
Dear Santa Claus:
We want to thank you, Santa, for all the toys and
things,
For bringing as per ordered, a few engagement rings.

You may be foxy, but not enough,
It’: long been written on the cuff,

That Ginny Kunkle and Roberts of rattlesnake state
Would soon announce their intention to mate.

Then just around Mt. Lebanon’: Corner,

We saw Clair’: jiltcd ready to mourn her,
So now, boys, you can only admire

The future Mrs. Grant Alexander Geyer.

A word from Alumni along matrimonial row
Says that a couple are ready to go,

Ginny Sepp and Charles Ebert,——do tell,

But Gee, I think that tie-up is simply swell.

Oh yes, and don't you remember, old kid,

When you gave us the Rose Bowl bid,

From east, west, north, and south, the critics came
a’ﬂockin’,

And we just let them bcc1'~-——and turned up ashes in
the Huskies’ stocking.

I hope you gave the Frosh, old dear, a. spark of no-
torious instigation,

So that we ‘may print their private loves in this col-
umn’s investigation.

Thaiiks for l.l})plll~_.'__' ii.-' oil‘ that on New Year's Eve,
Wn‘(i see Mckenna and Lutz on a picnic spree,

Shooting skyrocket: on a celebration deluxe-—
Still it saved McKeni-in a good many bucks.

Then Bill Kunkel in Pitt Riilo’s drill
Sprziiiiccl his ankle in a peculiar spill,
Yet that didn't stop the Kunkel prance,
We saw him spill at the D.T.D.’s dance.

\lVc peokccl on the 'l‘lio1,a’s “sluinberiiig parties”
And saw ('Upl(l'.\‘ ciistoma.i'_y darties.

Bill Stark and a few of his pals

Were New Year's Eve'in, but not with their gals.

|He Talked To Himself

By Milton Lehman
A microphone equipped cofﬁn awaits the death
of a certain Middle West business man whose
greatest fear is being buried alive. The grave site i
is wired to the cemetery office, where the care-
Iaker is under contract to listen regularly for one
year after the funeral- An electric bell is mounted
in the coﬁin for test purposes; all is okay if the
caretaker hears the bell when he closes the switch
in his cottage.—Pittsburgh Press, December, 1936.

First the wind screamed over the cemetei'_v_. pushing
hack and forward the branches of the quaking aspens
that lined the road. It howled‘ aross the field just as a
resonant clap of thunder banged through the sky. And
then another thunder blast.

Rain began to drip steadily. the drops reflecting the
gleam of the arc lights, cutting bright spots into the
darkness. It fell faster and faster. The sky poured down

water, barked at the rain and ran, dodging mud puddles,
toward the little cottage. The cottage was brightly lit.

lnside the cottage in young man wiped the steam
from the window and peered out. It was raining
hard now. He heard a scratch It the door. .
“Oh, it’: you, Rex," he said and opened the door.
The dog shook oil’ a cascade of water, trotted into
the room, and curled up at the log ﬁre, licking his
wet paws. “It is wet, isn't it Rex?" The young
” man patted him, and the dog wagged his tail furi-
ously. ; « ‘ 0 v
"You know, father, you haveift left the cemetery
for three weeks,” the young man began.
Across the room, the wizened old caretaker
stretched out clumsily in his overstuffed chair,
yawnecl, shrugged his shoulders.

“Now really, father,” he continued, drawing on his
giipe, “you’ll' begin to get morbid if you don’t snap out
of it. Yes, I know you signed that contract with old
Ml‘. Griggs, promising him to wait here for a year after
he was buried.

away from here in that long. Say, now, do you really
think you have to stay in this office, night after night?”

He got up, walked over to the window, looked out.
. It was still raining. . i" ’

'l"h<\‘ ‘old man crossed hisllegs, breathed in some smoke
from a cheap cigar, blew out a heavy column that
spiralcd until it hit the ceiling and broke. He looked
back at his son. . , .

"You know, boy,” heistarted. "I promised him

, that I'd wait. It’: not easy to break promieee like‘
that. No, I guess I'll ‘stick it out.” f '

He chewed at his cigar, glanced at the loud
speaker on his desk. There was 3 bottle of for-
maldehyde ancl a small box- of fumigating salts
pushed up against it. He got up slowly, yawned,
pushed the formaldehyde and salt away from the
speaker. He rolled the connecting wire between
his fingers, testing it. “No, I guess l’ll stick it
out,” be repeated.  . .

The young man glanced at his father. "Well,
maybe you're right. But it seems so unnecessary
to go to all that . . . Why, what’: the‘ matter?"_’ 1
