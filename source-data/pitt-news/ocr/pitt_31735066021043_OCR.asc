aid bill to

By Mike Seperack

Staff Writer

In an effort to battle scientific
illiteracy in the United States,
Rep. Doug Walgren (D-PA) in-
troduced a bill to Congress this
week to create college scholar-
ships in science, mathematics
and engineering.

Walgren is the chairman of the
House Subcommittee on
Science, Research and Tech-
nology.

The bill calls for two scholar-
ships,-one for a man and one for
a woman, to be awarded to high
school seniors in each congres-
sional district. The scholarships
will be awarded on the basis of
merit, with the National Science
Foundation determining the exact

requirements.

The scholarships will provide
$5,000 a year for four years,
which the student may use to at-
tend the university of his or her
choice. The proiected cost of the
program is $4.35 million per
year.

”The hope of the program is
that it will help restore science
literacy in America and en-
courage the brightest and the best
high school students to enter
science fields," explained Wal-
gren aide Ion Delano.

The bill was co—sponsored by
House Science.Committee Chair-
man Robert Roe (D-N.J.l and Sen.
John Glenn (D—N.l.). A bipartisan
majority of the House Science
Committee is already supporting

Pitt's Greek leaders" spoke,
listened, lauded and complained
about Greek life at the North-
eastern Panhellenic Conference
and the Northeastern lnterfrater-
nity Conference.

Crossroads to the Future was
the theme of the conference,
which was held last weekend at
the Westin William Penn Hotel
in downtown ‘Pittsburgh.

According to Jim. Venturella,
president of the lnterfraterni-ty
Council, the conference was a
place to exchange ideas, a place

where people can speak about is-
sues that students face within the
Greek system.

”This conference brings solu-
tions to problems we all face. We
can get ideas from other peers
from our region about how to
deal with our problems,” Ven-
turella said. ”lt’s been very suc-
cessful in the past. We've always
come back with a lot of new
ideas and solutions to current
problems.”

Anti—abortion vs. pro-choice philosophies examined

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

[First in a two-part 5eries.]

Mary Scanlon and Mary Litman
have never been formally in-
troduced, but, odds are, they
have met somewhere before.

Both are headstrong. They hold
to their beliefs with more fervor
than most. Because of this, it's un-
likely they'll ever be friends.

The U.S. Supreme Court made
it legal for all women to choose
to have an abortion in its 1973
landmark Roe vs. Wade decision.

However, the debate between
pro-life and pro-choice support-
ers has intensified in recent
months with the Supreme Court's
decision to reconsider a Missou-
ri law that could give individual
states more leeway in regulating

abortions.

Soon after his inauguration,
President George Bush promised
anti-abortion proponents like
Mary Scanlon and Operation
Rescue his every effort to see
their wishes become law.

Both sides are rearing for a
ﬁght

Just last Saturday, 209 mem-
bers of ‘Operation Rescue were
arrested in East Liberty for block-
ing the entrance to Allegheny
Women's Center, an abortion
clinic.

Operation Rescue has taken its
case to the streets and clinic en-
trances. its purpose: stop women
from killing their babies.

Mary Litman and other wom-
en's choice advocates are meet-
ing their opponents face to face
on the streets and bidding them
to keep their distance.

EJEJEI

Mary Scanlon took her place
outside the doors of yet another
abortion clinic. Like most others,
she sat head bowed, hands
clasped in an outspoken prayer to
be heard by those about to enter
the clinic. ‘

But on Oct. 29, 1988, her pray-
er was cut short.

About 10 a.m., the Pittsburgh
Police arrived to clear Scanlon
and her Operation Rescue com-
rades from the doon/vay to Wom-
en's Health Services. Neither
group would move.

The ”rescuers” were told what
to do by their leaders before the
rally, and they knew why it must
be done. They feel that the longer
the clinic is closed, the fewer ba-
bies will die.

Scanlon and 364 others were
arrested that day and charged
with disobedience to city code
1055 -— blocking a public side-
walk; 270 were given fines while
the remaining 95, including Scan-
lon, were given five-day jail sen-
tences. Scanlon would serve hers
three months later. _

When it was her turn to be ar-
rested, she didn’t resist.

Scanlon lay down. She spread
herself into a cross on the cool
concrete, and let the officers car-
ry her by the Iimbs to an await-
ing police vehicle.

God was pleased, she thought
while being lifted into the truck.
He would deliver her.

EIDCI

On Saturdays when she's not

working at Women's Health
Services, Mary Litman is often out
on those same streets in front of
the abortion clinics, but for differ-
ent reasons.

She and a handful of other
volunteers in yellow shirts stand
in plain view on the sidewalk.

They hear prayers, pleas and
shouts growing ever louder as the
demonstrators nearby become
fruitful and multiply.

She anxiously eyes the con-
crete horizon. Two figures, a
young man and woman, turn the
corner and walk slowly down the
sidewalk toward the clinic and
the mass of pro-Iifers.

Litman and the other "yellow
shirts" notice the couple and
reach them first. They ask the
young woman if she and her

Preate vows to end ‘climate of fear’

HARRISBURG (AP) -— Pennsyl-
vania Attorney General Ernie Pre-
ate Jr. said Monday the state will
take unprecedented steps to
break ”a climate of fear” created
by racial harassment at Penn State
University.

NEWS BRIEFS

For the first time, the attorney
general’s office, the state police
and the Human Relations Com-
mission will jointly investigateTn-
cidents that violate the ethnic
intimidation law, Preate said.

”These incidents are not
sophomore pranks and the per-
petrators cannot be dismissed
simply as misguided youth,” Pre-
ate said at a news conference.
”These are crimes and those
responsible are criminals.”

Homer Floyd, executive direc-

tor of the Pennsylvania Human

Relations Commission, said long-
standing racial tensions escalated
in the‘ past two weeks with
reports of at least three assaults by
whites on black students at the

- campus in rural State College.

The incidents have sparked a

series of student protests.

Preate said witnesses now fear
coming forward with informa-
tion. State investigators will seek
their cooperation and try to
prosecute the cases, he said.

"We're sending a clear mes-
sage we will not tolerate that kind
of behavior in this state,” Preate
said.

Bush returns from
Asia, Tower awaits

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ Presi-
dent Bush returned home Mon-
day night from a five-day Asian
voyage that he pronounced a
”productive and rewarding” jour-
ney and moved to take personal
command of the struggle to win
confirmation for John Tower as
defense secretary.

In a prepared statement he read
at the foot of the ramp to Air
Force One, Bush said his trip to
Japan, China and South Korea
demonstrated that the United
States ”is and will remain a Pa-
cific power."

’’It’s great to be home. God

bless the United States of Ameri-
ca,” Bush said in the chilly dark-
ness at Andrews Air Force Base
in suburban Maryland. Vice
President Dan Quayle was on
hand to welcome the new presi-
dent back from his first overseas
voyage.

In his brief statement, the presi-
dent said he had held ”thought-
ful and candid conversations”
with world leaders, including the
several he met with in Japan,
where he attended the funeral of
Emperor Hirohito. From there he
went to China for two days, fol-
lowed by a five-hour stopover in
Seoul.

Half of Americans
fear nuke accident

NEW YORK (AP) — Half the
Americans in a national poll be-
lieve a serious accident is likely
at a U.S. nuclear power plant,
despite safeguards put in place
since the Three Mile Island acci-
dent a decade ago.

Fifty-five percent of the respon-

Associated Press
supported the use of nuclear
power to generate electricity. But
eight in 10 favored tougher fed-
eral safety regulations, and most
opposed building new plants.

Most also opposed starting up
completed nuclear power plants
that are not yet running. And
while 48 percent said currently
operating plants should stay
open, 44 percent said they
should be either phased out or
shut down at once.

The national survey of 1,162
adults had a margin of error of
plus or minus 3 percent. It was
conducted Jan. 4-12-in advance
of the 10th anniversary of the ac-
cident which occurred on March
28, 1979, at the Three Mile Island
plant in Middletown, Pa.

Tighter federal regulation of the
nuclear power industry resulted
from the TMI accident, which
destroyed one of the plant's two
reactors.

In the survey, 63 percent said
they believed nuclear power
plants are safer now. I

Coping on Campus    

Director of Pitt's Counseling Center refutes myths, fears

Editor's Note: This is the first in
a series of weekly installments by
Dr. Robert P. Ca//agher, director
of the Counseling and Student
Development Center, about
counseling at the university and
psychological problems students
face.

I've been having some
problems lately and someone
suggested I see a counselor. What
is counseling anyway? Don't you
have to be a little weird to con-
sider this? How do you set up an
appointment, and what happens
then?

Questions such as these come
to us quite often at the Counsel-
ing and Student Development
Center, and I am delighted to an-
swer them. Counseling, most
simply stated, is an interaction
between a person who is "stuck”
in some way and in need of help,
and another person who is
trained in helping people get
’’unstuck.’’ ‘

Greeks-—

adviser to the IFC in the
Northeast.
According__ _to Jerome

O'Rourke, TFC internal vice presi-
dent, everyone involved with the
conference felt Gurnsey deserved
the award. ’’It was something
very special to all of us. She's do-
ing a hell ofa job. Ithink it would
be hard to find anyone on this
campus that's more devoted to
[his or her] organization than
[Curnsey]/’ said O’Ro_urke.

Pitt's IFC won an award for
public relations and a special
achievement award for its com-
munity relations packet. Panhel
won an award for its philanthro-
py and public relations.

According to Panhel secretary
Cara Patton, ”It was exciting to
be at the banquet. It was very
competitive. It was fun to be in
the middle.”

Among the topics discussed at
this conference were leadership
skills, alternatives to hazing, aca-
demic missions of Greek life and
critical trends for fraternities and
sororities.

O'Rourke said, "One "of the
most interesting seminars that I at-
tended was one with a represen-
tative from Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity. [ZBT] has recently got-
ten rid of their pledging program,
and people were  interested in
what he had to say.

”Many of the people were un-
happy with what he had to say
though, because ZBT has made
the stand that they feel the word
’p|edging’ is what's behind haz-
ing. Many people disagreed.
[Proponents] felt that [ZBT] had
very good pledge education pro-

" g_rams that strived to be educa-

tional without hazing.” V
According to Patton, ’’One 0

the best seminars I went to was
one on IFC-Panhel relations
which we thought would be a
good thing for us because [it is]
one of the things [IFC and Panhel]
need to 'work on. We work
together, _but’ not as much as we
should. We also learned that
we're not that bad off, though.
They gave us a lot of good ideas.”

Going for counseling does not
mean you are weird in any way.

 

DR. ROBERT-
GALLAGHER

although being a little weird
could probably define most of us
at one time or another. Most stu-
dents who seek counseling come
because they have a particular

problem in living that they want
help with, or because they are ex-
periencing stress or having some
feelings they don't understand.

More specifically, students
come for counseling for reasons
such as relationship problems,
shyness, lack of motivation, anxi-
ety, lack of assertiveness,
problems with a faculty member,
troubles on the home front and
other similar concerns.

You can make an appointment
for counseling by phone or in
person (334 William Pitt Union).

Appointments can be made with-

in a few days at certain times of

,the year but may take a few

weeks during the busy months
(November, December, Febru-
ary, March). Schedule adjust-
ments are made, however, in
emergency situations.

The psychologists and coun-
selors at the center are well
trained, caring and experienced
in working with college students.

Counseling sessions last about 30
minutes, and students who desire
or require long-term counseling
or therapy are referred outside the
university.
The actual counseling process
Is harder to describe since it
differs fron counselor to coun-
selor and from student to student.
Sometimes counseling consists
simply of sharing your thoughts
and feelings in confidence with
a counselor who is objective and
a good listener‘. This is often help-
ful when you have a decision to
‘make.

Sometimes counseling pro-
vides you with, or directs you to,
certain types of information and
then helps you to understand that
information. At other times
counseling may help you to
change your feelings about your-
self or others, or help you to
change some of your behavior.

The reasons for coming are

many and the counseling strate-
gies employed are also varied.
The only constant is that all of the
energies of the counselor are fo-
cused on trying to help you, the
student. It doesn't always work,
but our student evaluation forms
suggest that most students who
st‘(‘l\' counseling believe that it
has been helpful to them.

Over the next several months,
we will be attempting to answer
other commonly asked questions
raised by Pitt students. If you have
a question you wouldlike an-
swered, send it to Dr. Robert P.
Gallagher, Director, Counseling
and Student Development
Center, 33-! William Pitt Union,
PA 15260. If you would like a

personal response, include a
number where you can be
reached.

The grand obsession

with acts of violence

Now, for only $4, it is possible to see the view from
the window of what was once the Texas Book Deposi-
tory in Dallas, and to see the exact arrangement of the
boxes which hid Lee Harvey Oswald from the sight of
his co-workers as he shot and killed John F. Kennedy.

If that isn't enough for the historically minded per-
son, one can tune in shows such as America's Most
Wanted, The Revenge of Al Capone, and Unsolved

‘ Mysteries to see dramatic reproductions of some of his-

tory's greatest and most repulsive murders, shootouts,
rapes and mutilations.

To help you digest all of this information, there are
shows addressing the ”issues" involved: Ceraldo, The
Morton Downey Ir. Show, Inside Edition... '

Yes, America's newest fad is morbid curiosity. From
the papers (Weekly World News, The Star, the ever-
popular National Enquirer) to the television screen, our ' ‘
most readily accessible media for communication are
swamped with tales of death and violence, one usual-
ly leading to the other.

We can treat ourselves with such little gems as see- ,1

ing Mark Harmon play Ted Bundy in the movie of the
week. We can pick up a tabloid to see the first photos
of Bundy’s dead body. .

Although ambulance chasing has always been one
of everyone’s favorite pastimes, certainly one of jour-
nalism’s, we are now awash is a sea of explicit photos,
dramatic recreations and exploitative derivations that
are feeding the nation's collective obsession with the
horrors and the pains suffered by victims of violent
crime. No one seems to wonder how it can be stopped.
The attitude that it should be stopped doesn't even ex-
ist. While individuals like Bundy and.some of the
"hardened criminals” on America '5 Most Wanted
should certainly be pLit away, and there is no lack of
commentary on that fact, there is still the very power-
ful sense of continuity — that if violent crime came sud-.
denly to a halt, what in the world would the viewer
watch on Sunday nights, now that Family Ties is boring?

The attitudes that are shown by this morbidity are not
easy ones to deal with. The freedom of expression is
an American absolute. These shows are not the
problem, they are a symptom. As long as there is an
audience for them, we know that the problem exists.
But how to fight the ambulance-chasing mentality is a
much more difficult question. The law acts as protec-
tion against those who are sane, but sufficiently amoral
to commit an act of violence as a means to an end.
These programs, however, show an unhealthy fascina-
tion with violence, that is far more widespread than it
should be, and more difficult to regulate.

The answer lies within the media themselves. At-
tempts to provide positive input to offset the negative
are necessary. This is not as simple as it may seem.
There is in human nature a tendency toward anger, and
the expression thereof, which needs to be dealt with.
But healthy, realistic approaches to the expression of
anger are far too rare on- television and in the papers,
and everywhere you look, you can see another exam-.
ple of psychotic, twisted responsesto' the pains and frus-
trations of life. Instead of concentrating on the waste

. of human life resulting from psychoses, we should be
. focusing our attention, and the attention of potentially-

educational media, on ways to- prevent such things from

Atrocities in the name of faith

I believe Jesus Christ lived on
this earth.

Now notice how I said I didn't
say that I believed ”in” him, so
as not to be confused with the fol-
lowers of a faith created in his
name. '

Jesus was truly'a beautiful per-
son, if we look past the rhetoric
which has poisoned so many
minds, and I believe that if he
were here today, he'd be sick-
ened at what atrocities have been
and are being committed in his
name. _  {~   7

Today, a lot of Christians seem
to be shocked at the ‘recent
decline in attendance at their
churches and the reduction of the
number of people subscribing to
their faith. Perhaps their
2,000-year chokehold on human-
ity has slipped away, and they-
now are like fish out of water.

Literally millions upon millions
of people worldwide have died
for the "Prince of Peace” (of
death and of pain). Four and a
half million people were tortured
and burned in witch hunts an_d
the Spanish Inquisition;'1.3‘mil—
lion died in South America when
the Spanish Conquistadors tried
to convert the Aztecs, Incas and
Mayans. Nine million died in
Germany because of the blind
rage of a man named Adolph Hi-
tler. What of our own Native
Americans, who are still consi-
dered heathens, and referred to as
"red savages” in our history

books and movies?

The Judgement Day is coming,
oh yes, Brothers and Sisters, it's
a-coming! But it's not coming for

Tolerance

[Mario Oliverio,] I am very dis-
appointed. I often read your
column, and each time I hope to‘
find some shred of intelligent
thought. Unfortunately, my
search is fruitless each and every
time. Your latest article, ”The rise
and fall of Christianity” [Feb. 22],
has sent me over the edge. Not
only is your analysis shallow, but
it is also historically flawed.

You state that there were no
women apostles and imply that a
fema|e"s place in the church is
secondary. Following the death"
of Christ, women were an ‘in-

ge‘ of the I_ord Onl

the pagans (which literally means
people of the earth) and heathens
(which means people of the
heaths) who don't subscribe to a
sickened religion. It's coming for
those who still, in this day and
age, commit atrocities in the
name of Jesus Chist.

  

JEICA
COVILLE

Christians will be forced, in this
new era, to re-examine what they
believe. To look back without
blinders on, and see what Jesus
was really saying. .

Hopefully, they will even be
forced to look back through the
history books and learn of a cer-
tain pope who declared that all
Christian holidays should coin-

‘ cide with pagan holidays.

For example, Christmas Day
did not come into existence.un-
til 325 A.D., and it happens that
Dec. 25 is a celebratory day for
the Sun King, Mithras.

Easter (originally called Eostre)

was ‘a fertility holiday, honoring
the coming of spring. Why do

people think there are bunny rab-
bits and ”Easter eggs"? Because
Jesus declared them to be?
And Feb. 2, a day called ”Can-
d|emas" in the Catholic Church,
when Catholics honor the Virgin
Mary, is actually a holiday
celebrating the coming of the sea-

. son of light.

That same pope also declared

‘ that all churches be built on pa-

gan temples, because the conver-
sion was not as fluid as the
Christians claim.

It is a frightening—:time,.|iagree.
However, I am frightened at what
last heinous crimes aregoing to
be committed before Christiani-
ty finally loses its last grasp.

I know I've probably angered I

some readers out there, and I cer-

tainly don't hold all Christians ac-‘
countable for what happened

years ago. I also know a lot of

beauty, in the forms of art, music"
and poetry, has stemmed from

Christianity. But please don't con-

demn me to your hell (or your

heaven, for that matter) because

I don't follow your faith.

Go back to the basics... respect
this Earth and respecteach other.
Acknowledge the balances of
male and female, light and dark,
and life and death. By returning
to the basics, we can only leap»
forward in our own
vancement.

And when Christians pray for
”heathens" who subscribe to the
aforementioned, know that we
heathens pray forthem in return.

Next, you address the portray-
al of Christ as a woman. This im-
agery emphasizes the feminine
aspect of Christ. Similarly, the
many portrayals of Christ ‘as a
black man that I have encoun-

openness of Christ to everyone,

Finally, you quote the Bible to

you espouse a view of violence
and murder and claim a connec-

Bush and his appointees: truly a merry band of rogues

What do the following men
have in common: John Tower,
Louis Sullivan, C. Boyden Gray
and James Baker? They were all
appointed to the Bush Cabinet
and are either facing or have
faced close scrutiny for past
foibles.

George Bush, the man who
would return to the ”high, ethi-
cal standards” days of the Carter
era, very well might fall into the
vat of sleaze that so plagued the
Reagan presidency.

Most of you will remember
Ronald Reagan and the ”sleaze
factor.” During Reagan's tenure
in office, only one cabinet mem-
ber lasted the entire eight years;
that was ”Silent Sam” Pierce.
Pierce was Reagan's secretary for
Housing and Urban Develop-
ment. Don’t feel bad ifyou don't
remember Pierce; Reagan himself
had to be re—introduced to Pierce
in 1985 when he had forgotten
Pierce’s name.

The melange of characters who
left the Oval Office under storm

Does the

On the opening day of the
Oliver North trial last Tuesday,
the New York Times editorialized
on why the trial should proceed:
_’’It is the need to uphold anew
the principle that even the com-
mander in chief has a com-
mander in chief: the law.’’

A Washington Post editorial the
same day said, ’’If Congress can
be defied with impunity by
selected parts of the executive
branch, then the system does
break down.”

This was the same New ,York
Times that reported in June 1979
on the Nicaraguan Sandinistas,
”A doctor  praised the young
rebels. ’They’re not Communists,’
he said. ’That's a fairy tale that
Somoza invented and only the
National Guard believes.’ ”

This was the same Washington
Post which wrote just days after
the Sandinista-led » government
took power on July 19, 1979,
”The‘ new [Sandinista laws]
project the new government as
highly moralistic, concerned

Fast, furious motion is fun. It is

General Ed Meese and former-
Secretary of the interior James
Watt.

Now what does this have to do
with the Bush administration?
Plenty. When reporters barraged

about state security, politically
liberal in a social democratic
mold."

The Post and the Times turned
out to be wrong about the San-
dinistas, just as they are wrong in
their conclusion about the North
trial.

As former Special Assistant to
the Presidentfor National Secu-
rity Affairs Constantine Menges
has written in his powerful new
book, Inside the National Secu-
rity Council, it was the State
Department, assisted by several
spineless people in key positions
at the White House, that opened

_ the door to the Iran-Contra affair,

for which Oliver North is the
primary fall guy. ‘ ,

In the military, if one defies a
direct order from a superior, one
may be court-martialed. In
civilian life, disobedience to the
boss's instruction can get ‘you
fired. But in government, the
State Department may disregard,
circumvent and countermand the
foreign policy of the elected com-

place. ‘

if all of this strikes a chord wi-
thin you, then you have my
sympathy. ’

Ever feel trapped?

Here we go again

just as happy as can be

on the never-ending carrousel
of the end of you and me.

Sound familiar now?

The thing about unpleasantness
is that it is never unqualified.
There is always some grain in it,
something that you won't let go
of, that you would never wish
had never happened, that keeps
you coming back for more.

Thought patterns are tricky
things. After you have had the
same thoughts a few times, they
start to become habitual. Familiar
thought processes become sub-
conscious ones. Your brain learns
to take a certain path, and it will
continue to do so, unless con-
sciously resisted.

This is not as simple as trying ,
to stop cracking your knuckles. ».

 

Bush with the question on who
his veep would be, Bush replied,
“Watch my decision, it will tell
all." Due to embarrassment, I re-
fuse to go into the "Quayle fac-
tor,” but i do think that it is
reasonable to apply that same an-
swer to Bush's Cabinet ap-
pointments.

Bush's appointments are in
trouble. One of Bush's first ac-
complishments as the American
CEO was the establishment of the
Ethics Committee. They sure
have had their hands full. Accord-
ing to the New York Times, the
following actions, which were
recommended by the Ethics
Committee, were performed by
the appointees:

Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher announced that he
would not participate in official
decisions involving oil, gas and
the cosmetics industry since he
has interests in these enterprises.
James Baker had to sell all his
stock in public corporations, and
Louis Sullivan had to forfeit a

mander in chief and suffer no
consequences, save the weaken-
ing of the presidency and the auc-
tioning of freedom to Communist
tyrants in exchange for unfulfilled
dreams of ”peace.”

CAL
THOMAS

Naming names, places and
dates, Menges documents the
cunning and dishonest methods
used by everyone from former

Secretary of State George Shultz ,

and others on down and indicts
them (no, one else will) for pur-
suing a policy of their own in
direct violation of specific instruc-
tions from Ronald Reagan.
Menges shows clearly that the
foreign policy establishment at
State believes no‘one else better
understands how the world
should work than they do, and
that some career foreign service
officers view the president of the
United States as simply a caretak-

|t’s even harder than ‘quitting
smoking.

Think about it. Everyone has
these automatic reactions. Do
you remember the last time you

‘talked to your parents? For me,

it's easy to slip into the five or six
automatic responses to the five or
six things that they always say to
me. It's natural to develop this
reflex behavior. And it's damn

, hard to stop your reflexes.

But automatic responses are

_ not the heart and soul of the cir-

cular game.

They help — once you get
caught in the spin, the automatic
responses make it infinitely hard-

er to break free. But it comes-

down to my earlier point. There
are always the good and the bad.
Each circular situation‘ has both
the cloud and the silver lining.

The distinctions between the

two becomes somewhat blurry.
In the beginning, the good shines
forth; after a while however, it be-
comes a beacon in the dark, as
the, bad aspects of the situation

slowly loom over the good.;The 

 

whopping $30,000 in severance
pay. Even C. Boyden Gray, White
House legal counsel and chief
consultant to the Ethics Commit-
tee, had to distance himself from
the family business.

As for John Tower, oh boy, he's
a column himself. He was caught
with his hands in the cookie jar,
his pants down and his head co-
vered by a lampshade.

When the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee voted Tower
down by 11-9, committee chair
Sen. Sam Nunn (D—Ga.) gave this
explanation: "Leadership must be
established from the top down."
When the Japan-visiting Bush
heard the news, he vowed to
fight the decision and take it to
the Senate. Now, not only will
this be an exercise in futility since
the Senate will most likely vote
it down, but it will also lengthen
the amount of time that the mili-
tary is without a civilian leader.
Swallow your pride, Bush. Forget
.WC. Fields and give the job to

er, while State has been endowed
with. the unalienable right to
shape the world as it desires."

Menges reveals how then-U.N.
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick
had her credibility cut from un-
der her when, in early 1983, she
carried a personal letter from
President Reagan to each of the

friendly heads of state, in ‘Cent_ra'l 0;
America. Upon returning_ to

Washington, she learned that As-
sistant Secretary of State Thomas
Enders had sent an ”eyes only”
cable to all the U.S. ambassadors
in the region, instructing them to
ignore Kirkpatrick (and by impli-
cation, the president), because a
new Central American strategy
was being prepared and would
be passed along as soon as Shultz
returned from a trip to China.

There were secret meetings be-
tween officials at State and
Nicaraguan dictator ‘Daniel Orte-
ga, in violation of procedures that
required a review of all such
meetings by the "president and
NSC.

natural reaction is to try to ‘put
some distance between the situ-
ation and oneself.

The circuity emerges shortly
thereafter. It is brought on by two
important factors. The first is the
blurring of vision due to time. Af-
ter a certain period of time, the
good things stand out more than
the bad. After a while, the bad
things actually seem good. There

develops an attraction to the un-..

happiness of the situation. Com-
fortable anguish is better than
uncomfortable nothingness.
When one has felt a certain way
for a certain time, then an affini-
ty grows for the feeling, even if
the feeling isdesperately bad.

The second thing that promotes
circular motion is the inclination
to have automatic thoughts. If

you are accustomed to going to ,

a certain place or calling a certain
person, then you will. get the

thoughtto do so fed to you ,in;a*-

Colin Powell or Elliott Abrams.

I admit that the above appoin-
tee/secretaries, with the excep-

tion of Tower, are not exactly

sleazoids and that they did follow
the Ethics Committee's instruc-
tions. The question is, though,
would they have done the right
thing if their respective indiscre—

tions weren't revealed? .|f history '_

teaches anything, then the an-
swer is no.

George Bush should not sho_ul-~ V A

der the full blame just because

Jimmy Baker owned stock" in j
something that could affect his‘
judgement on some issues. But it

is Bush's fault when pride post-
pones the appointment of a new
defense secretary for at least two

more weeks. it's times like these

Kemp for the Pennsylvania
primary.

State Department run our foreign pol icy?

Menges tells of elaborate
schemes to block meetings of the
NSC which, when held, almost
always resulted in the president
rejecting the policy initiatives of
Shultz and the State Department
and opting for policies that would
advance the cause of freedom
and democracy in _Centra_l
America. ’

boyfriend would like to be ac-

Aware of the protestors block-
ing the clinic entrance, the young
woman agrees.

Woman, man and escorts
move slowly through the crowd
of prayers and shouts toward the
door of the clinic.

Litman steadies her body as a
shield against the mob, but she
can't stop their words.

”Come to us. Don't go into the
clinic. Please,” they cry, "don’t
kill your baby!"

At last, inside. Quiet.

The young woman will have
her abortion. Her future is saved,
Litman thought. She is relieved.

The young woman is weeping.

Mary Scanlon is not as optimis-

Scanlon, it is no longer con-
venient to believe in the right to

He was also charged with alter-

and carrying a gun in the airport.

Gore was arrested by Alleghe-

his bail was set at $25,000

Police said they asked for a
high bail because Core does not

that they have a change of heart
and repent for what they've done.

’’I think they are killers,” Scan-
lon said of those operating the
clinics. ”Just like anyone who
kills someone else.”_

Scanlon claims she is a devout
Catholic. For her, life begins at
the moment of conception.

’’I don't think you can put an
arbitrary mark on it at some other
point in time,” she said.

Scanlon said she has heard of
premature deliveries as early as
the fifth month who were careful-
ly nursed into healthy infants. _

Some clinics will perform abor-
tions at five months, she claimed.

”Hitler killed 6 million Jews

one, or just about everyone,

”Lega|ly, blacks used to be
considered not human beings,
and that was wrong.

”The lunch counter sitters and
the civil rights movement — they
were infringing on other people's
rights to have their lunch because
noone could sit; they were oc-
cupying all the seats.

”But,” Scanlon said firmly,
”what they were doing, even
though it was against the law, it
was right.”

If abortion were to again be-
come illegal, Scanlon would ex-
pect the government to punish
those who had sought out_and se-
cured abortions even though, she

said, ’’I don't like\to see anyone

punished.

”They’d have to do something
just like [the city] did something
with us because we were sitting
on the sidewalk.”

What does God think about the
clinic operators and women who
give and receive abortions?

”They might be able to be

ans,” she said. '

Tanpb
brings out
true WVU

squad

Well, maybe now the state
of West Virginia will wake up.
Their beloved Mountaineers
lost a basketball game after
winning 22 straight.

They not only lost, they
were totally destroyed by
Temple, 74-56. Now if itwere
last year, this wouldn't be
much of a surprise.

VINCE
CAREY

Last year, lemple was the
No.1 team in the nation for
most of the season. They went
into the NCAA Tournament
with just a single loss, to
UNLV. They beat teams like
North Carolina and George-
town. There was talk that the
Owls, led by freshman phe-
nom Mark Macon, would be
a perennial power. Maybe
even the 10th Big East team.

Ah, but things change. The
Owls lost center Ramon Rivas
and first-round draft pick Tim
Perry, two big players whose

of the team. They were a force
to be reckoned with because
nobody could double—team
the inside players and let the
outside shooters, Macon and
Mike Vreeswyk, put up the
three—pointer.

This season, Temple doesn't
have an inside game (granted,
Duane Causwell is the Atlan-
tic 10 leader in rebounds, but
he is only a junior and has not
perfected his "game yet), and
teams have been able to key
on Vreeswyk and Macon,
leaving Temple very vulnera-
ble. They started out the sea-
son 0-3 but have since been
able to string together enough
wins to make them 16-10 and
14-3 in the Atlantic 10.

Sunday's game against the
Mountaineers showed what
Temple is capable of doing.
They came out running and
jumped to a quick lead, then
cruised to the victory. The
’Eers had fallen.

West Virginia visited Fitz-
gerald Field House on Dec.
10, 1-988, sporting a 2-2
record (having lost to Robert
Morris and Bradly). The Pan-
thers were 3-1 (losing to Sie-
na). The Mountaineers
upended the Panthers and_|eft
with an 84-81 overtime
victory.

They then went on a
22-game winningstreak. They
beat up on teams like George
Washington (1-25), St.
Joseph's (6-20), Massachusetts
(10-16), Duquesne (11-15), St.
Bonaventure (13-13), Rhode
Island (13-13), Rutgers (14-12),
Penn State (1 7-9) and Temple.

In short, the Atlantic 10. Not

Tensions were high last
weekend as the Panther Hockey
Club captured its first West Penn
College Hockey Association
Championship trophy before its
largest crowd of the season at
Golden Mile Ice Centerin Mon-
roeville.

The Panthers defeated The In-
diana University of Pennsylvania
Apaches 6-1 after upending the
West Virginia‘ University Moun-
taineers 1-0 on Saturday at
Belmont.

It was the first championship
season for the club since 1981,
and also the Panthers’ first un-
defeated season at 13-0.

   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

"I feel we've done our school
a good honor in winning this.
We've played hard all season,
and we deserved this,” said Pan-
ther assistant captain Eric Ander-
son after Sunday's game.

Coach Jeff Bele attributed their
success this weekend to the Pan-
ther defense.

”,Our goaltending was spec-
tacular. Mark [D’Amico] played
two of his , best games this
weekend. _ .

"When "we have good
goaltending like we had this
weekend, it makes us very tough
to beat," stated Bele.

D’Amico, the Panthers’
31-year-old goaltender, made a
total of 31 saves this weekend.

”Playing with these guys makes

D’Amico said.

The Panthers needed only one
period to assert their dominance
over IUP, capitalizing on Apache
penalties to score three power-
play goals.

With 7:35 remaining in the
period, team captain Brian
Owens scored the first of the Pan-
thers’ power-play goals.

Trailing Owens’ goal by two
minutes, John Carlins scored the
second power play and what
would prove to be the game-
winning goal. Earning assists on
Carlins’ goal were Tony Travato
and Dave Koval.

Forty-one seconds after Carlins’
goal, Panther right wing Mike
Cuchran came from behind the

Swimmers finish third at Easterns

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's swim team
capped off their 1988-89 season
with a third-place finish at the
Eastern Women's Championship
meet held last weekend at Penn
State.

Third place is quite impressive
considering the high level of
competition in the East. Harvard

"won the meet with 919 points.

Penn State was second with
708.5..

Brown led Pitt up to the last
day of competition, but Pitt
showed a lot of character and
overtook Brown, 609-553.
Princeton finished fifth with
473.5 points.

”It was a year that will be very
memorable to me,”_ said Pitt
Coach David Belowich. ~”We
were 9-1 in dual meets; we won
the Pitt Invitational and the Big
East meets, and we swam
perhaps the best Eastern Champi-

  
 

onship meet a Pitt team ever

has."

Almost all of Pitt's swimmers
scored points. Freshman Laura
Lee Sullivan finished her impres-
sive year by setting two records.

She broke a pool record and
won the 100-meter breaststroke
event with a time of 1:04.58. She
narrowly missed qualifying for
the NCAA meet in that event. She
also placed second in the 200
breaststroke.

"I missed NCAA cuts by one-
tenth of a second, which is a lit-
tle disappointing, but I got a pool
record as a freshman, so I can't
complain,” said Sullivan. ”I

. didn't expect tolget a second in

the 200 event, so I was pretty
pleased with the meet as a
whole.’’

Sullivan also teamed with San-
dy Albright, Noelle Barry and
Christine Gallagher to set a new
school record in the 400 medley
relay. I '

          

’’I look at school records as the "

highest compliment to a coach,’_’
said Belowich. ”|t shows..~im-

iprovement in the program."

Pitt also won and set another A
pool record in the 400 freestyle
"relay race, despite being seeded

behind powerhouses Harvard
and Penn State. Laure Walczak
gave Pitt a slight lead-to start the
race. Tricia.Rickert and Celeste
Makiel kept the race close with
Harvard, and Gallagher polished
off Harvard's best swimmer to
win the race.

Gallagher commented, ”It'was
fun. We were actually going to
settle for third place because we
were in the background from
Harvard and Penn State. I don't
even remember the last lap; I just
looked over at the team, and I

knew we won. It was probably,
the greatest personal moment of ,

the entire season for me.”

How does this sound for a day
in the life of a student athlete?

0 6:45 a.m. to 8 a.m., running
and aerobics in the practice room
in Fitzgerald Field House.

°1:15—2:30 p.m., weight
training.

0 3:30-5:45 p.m., practice.

The above daily schedule is
brought to you courtesy of the
average member of the Pitt Pan-
ther wrestling team. It is the most
demanding itinerary, both physi-
cally and in terms of time, of any
of the varsity sports here at Pitt.
Most wrestlers have to take night
classes in order to accommodate
the training schedule.

As a result, these athletes are in
superb condition; arguably the
best condition of any athlete in-
volved in sports. The ‘University
of Pittsburgh is a Division I, 14th-
ranked wrestling team that com-
petes in a conference which is
wrestling’s equivalent to Big East
basketball. The Eastern Wrestling
League is comprised of eight
teams, all of which are ranked in
the top 20.

The Panthers have a defending
national champion on their team,
currently ranked No.2 in the na-
tion. The team consistently finish-
es with a winning record every
season, and brings one or two
wrestlers to the NCAA champion-
ships every year. So why don't
these athletes get the kind of
respect and attendance figures
that draw so many fans to basket-
ball games?

The answer seems to be very
basic: a lack of publicity and a
general unfamiliarity with the
sport of wrestling.

Pitt assistant wrestling coach
Stan Mousetis explains, "We’re
interested in getting the draw, of
course. But we're not getting the
publicity that we should get.‘ I

. think our own Sports Information v

department has got to get us a lit-

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, February 28, I989

Media attention eludes
wrestlers despite record

tle more publicity.

"We've got to get more of our
students here. A lot of people
don't even know we're wrestling.
There are a lot of basketball play-
ers and basketball fans who
would come and see a wrestling
match if they knew it was here,
and once they got familiar with
the sport.”

Mousetis feels that Pitt Sports
Information is not doing quite
enough to publicize the exploits
of the wrestling team to highly
visible media areas, such as The
Pittsburgh Press, the Post-
Gazette, and even television.

Also, everyone at Pitt certainly
knows when the next Pitt home
hoops game is. Not only is the
ticket distribution schedule for
the entire season posted on a bill-
board inside the William Pitt Un-
ion, but all local television
stations and newspapers preview
each upcoming basketball game.

All this media hype over a team
that is currently 15-11 on the sea-
son and has a slim chance of go-
ing to the NCAA tournament. -

But let's talk wrestling for a
minute. Pat Santoro is 40-2 this
season, has already attended the
annual NCAA all-star match, is
defending his national title this
year; and he occasionally wres-
tles one weight class above his
usual (142), still pinning oppo-
nents who are ranked in the top
10.

Pitt's 126-pound wrestler, Matt
Rizzo, feels ignorance is a major
part of the lack of attendance at
wrestling matches.

"People are lazy. They don't
want to take the time to learn
about wrestling,” Rizzo said.
"They only understand basketball
because it's been coming into
their homes all of their lives.

''I go to all kinds of different
sports, like gymnastics and
volleyball just to watch. I never
know how they score those
sports until I see them live and

learn about them.”

In contrast to Pitt, wrestling at-
tendance and fan interest is alive
and well at Penn State. Wrestling
coach Rich Lorenzo said a small
crowd for his team is about
2,500. A regular crowd is a sel-
lout of 7,000 plus turning people
away at the door.

"A lot of people talk about how

wrestling is dying, but we find its ,

[popularity] is increasing every
year,” Lorenzo said. "A lot of
high schools in our area have to
put their matches on video tape
in their cafeterias because of
overflowing crowds.

"So wrestling is alive and well
in Pennsylvania, and we're hap-
py to help these young people
decide to come to Penn State,
Pittsburgh, Lock Haven or any-
where in Pennsylvania to com-
pete ~because‘of the great
following and support these
schools have for wrestling,"
Lorenzo said.

Pitt averages about 200-300

people for its home matches in an

arena which is capable of hold-
ing over 6,500. Wrestling is not

alive. and. well at Pitt except‘

among the die-hard wrestling
fans, friends, parents and girl-
friends of the Pitt wrestlers.

Despite his success, Santoro is
not a household name like Brian
Shorter or Sean Miller.

Pitt wrestling coach Rande
Stottlemyer believes‘ that having
a great wrestling team in a major

metropolitan area is an almost in-or ‘

surmountable obstacle in draw-
ing fans,

"With all the other schools in
the EWL, sometimes wrestling is
the only show in town," Stott-
lemyer said. ~

"The No.1 sport at Clarion,
Lock Haven, Bloomsburg and
Edinboro is wrestling. They're Di-
vision ll schools, and wrestling is

the one sport where they put all 0

the eggs in the basket.
“At Pitt, let's be honest: the two
major sports are football and

, basketball. They get all the ink,

but I think we have a lot of other
great teams here, and we're one
of them.

"At Penn State, you can say
that football is king, but in the

‘ winter they don't have to com-
. pete with basketball. Also, what

else is there to do at Penn State
on a Saturday night?"

True. On any given‘Saturday
night in Pittsburgh, you. can pos-
sibly watch the Penguins on TV,
see Pitt basketball live (if it's a
home game) or watch them on
TV, go to a concert Downtown,

. or attend one of the many sched-
5 uled university functions.

Not only are there many differ- I
 ent sports teams in this city com-
‘ peting for your sports dollar, but
there are also major entertain-
_ ment promoters (DiCeasare-
_ Engler, Next Big Thing Produc-
tions) tryingto getconsumers to_

spend their incomes on some-

' thing other than sporting events.

"That presents a major
problem for us,” Stottlemyer said.
"Not only do we have to com-

V pete within the university to draw

fans, but we wind up Competing
with the entire city of Pittsburgh."

Basically, Pitt wrestling is the
story of a consistently good team
which.has trouble attracting fan

I it seems that their basketball

score to date, but we still haven't
reached our potential.

”The gym and the conditions
were good. I didn't expect to
score that well.”

The Panthers were limited at
this meet due to injuries. On
three of the six events, D’Amico
sent only the required five com.-

 WiIson priming for first full Pirate season

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. — Glenn
Wilson is concentrating this
spring on crunching baseballs,
not crunching numbers.

Many players use spring train-
ing as a time to set personal goals
for batting average, homers, RBI,
and, of course, next year's salary.

‘But don't number Wilson, the
Pittsburgh Pirates’ right fielder,
among the players who consider
big numbers to be their No.1
priority.

”The greatest thing about [my]
coming to the Pirates [last season]
was that I could concentrate on
doing what I do best, playing
defense and supplying whatever
offense I can,” Wilson said. ’’I
have no personal goals what-
soever. If the club wins, all of that
will take care of itself.”

Wilson knew his days with
Seattle were numbered last spring
when, after being traded in the
offseason by Philadelphia, there
was media and fan speculation
he could be the 25 homers-100
RBI hitter the Mariners have
sought for years.

Wilson, whose career high is
15 homers, is best suited for a
lineup where he isn't the top
power threat, where he can col-
lect his share of RBIs after the
cleanup hitter has cleaned up.
Hitting behind Mike Schmidt
with the Phillies in 1985, Wilson
drove in a career—high 102 runs.

Wilson was also under pres-
sure in Seattle for another kind of
number: his $750,000 salary on
what is traditionally baseball's
lowest—paying team.

”There was a lot of added pres-
sure in Seattle. I was in the last
year of my contract, and Ifound

myself trying to do too much,” he
said. ”That’s why I'm excited
about being over here in Pitts-
burgh, because I love playing for
a club that stresses pitching and
defense.”

Pirates manager Jim Leyland
said Wilson's combined total of
29 homers and 186 RBI in 1985
and 1986 might have created un-
realistic expectations.

’’I’m not looking for him to do
anything along those lines,” Ley-
land said. ”I don't think he’s go-
ing to drive in 102 runs for us.
But if he plays most_ of the time
and can give us 70-80-85 RBI,
that's plenty good enough.”

After a falling out with former
Seattle manager Dick Williams,
Wilson was traded by the
Mariners to the Pirates last July 21
for outfielder Darnell Coles. He
hit .250 with three homers and
17 RBI in 78 games with Seattle

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, February 28, I989

and .270 with two homers and
15 RBI in 40 fewer games with
the Pirates. .

”He showed me some things
the way he swung the bat at the
end of the season,” Leyland said,
pointing to Wilson's .340 average
in his final 13 games.

Wilson, who led NL outfielders
in assists for three consecutive
seasons, said that leaving the
cynical Williams to play under
the enthusiastic Leyland has him
pumped up about 1989.

”I was playing [in Seattle] for a
manager who didn't even like
himself,” Wilson said. ’’If you

-can't get along with [pitcher]

Mark Langston, who is one of the
nicest guys anywhere, you can't
get along with anybody.  I don't
know of any [players who got
along with Williams].

”]im is a solid manager, that's
the best way I can say it. He

Rooney back on track without Tyson

By Hal Bock

AP Sports Writer

SCHENECTADY, N.Y. — On
the night that Mike Tyson beat up
English muffin Frank Bruno, the
trainer he left behind was too
busy with more basic boxing bus-
iness to ‘watch.

Kevin Rooney had a fighter in
the finals of the Adirondack
Golden Gloves Regional Tourna-
ment at a local hotel ballroom. So
on this night, Kelvin Prather, and

not Mike Tyson, ‘was Rooney's
priority.

”I’m really more interested in
him than I am in this,” he said,
after HBO transported him across

downtown Schenectady in a limo

and sat him in front of a monitor
to watch the heavyweight title
fight.

And, as if to prove his point,
Rooney walked out on the HBO
monitor before Tyson and Bruno
ever made it into the ring at Las
Vegas. He hustled back across

town in the limo, returning to the
hotel ballroom where the Gold-
en Glove kids were beating on
each other, fiercely fighting for
medals, not millions.

Rooney's dismissal by Tyson

was widely interpreted as a one-

fight suspension for speaking out
of turn. The trainer may have
sealed the issue, however, by
charging the champ with breach
of contract and suing for a cool
$10 million. , A
The suit, filed last week, was
nothing personal according to
Rooney. "He’s"|ike a brother to
me," the trainer said. ”Sure I
want him to win. He's my fight-
er. Ididn’t want to file a suit. It’s
not about money. It's about prin-

ciple. I have a contract: He’s be-
ing brainwashed by someone
who is cold-hearted. You got a

contract. Be a man. Do the
contract.”.
For three rounds, Prather

punched and was punched and
when the fight was over, he had
won his trip to Syracuse and been
named the outstanding boxer of
the tournament. In Vegas, Mike
Tyson was finished with his
night's work too — a winner in
the fifth round.

Somebody relayed the informa-

tion to Rooney, who smiled thin-A

ly. ”I’m not surprised it went
rive,” he said. ”Maybe if Kevin
Rooney is there, it doesn't go five.

The night turned cold,
Co/o'er than the moon,

The stars were white as bone,
The stadium was old,

Older than the screams,
Older than the teams,

There were three men down,
And the season lost,

And the tarpaulin was rolled
upon the winter frost.

— Simon and Garfunkel.

It's hard to imagine, when con-
sidering the nearly decrepit state
of professional sports, any real
correlation between athletics and
love. As for football, the most vio-
lent of sports, the relationship is

even less apparent. Quarterbacks J

and Cupid never really had much
in common.

But Tom Landry of the Dallas
Cowboys was fired over the
weekend.

And now, the slowly dying
relationship between the Cow-
boys and the only coach the team
has ever had is now sadly over.
Memories take over from here.

Pirates’

°Leyland

By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. — Ken
Oberkfell, who has played for
some of the best managers in
baseball, says Pittsburgh's Jim

9Leyland has developed an out-

standing reputation among op-
posing players.

”He’s one of the best managers
I've. ever played for, and I've
been lucky to play for some good
ones,” including Whitey Herzog,
said Oberkfell, a Pirates’ utility in-
fielder. -

”He knows the game inside
and out. He can communicate
with his players.  He's a play-
ers’ manager,” Oberkfell said
Monday at the Pirates’ training

*9 camp.

Oberkfell, who was traded
from Atlanta to the Pirates last Au-

as the one and only former Dal-
las head coach in the history of
the world.

How Landry unceremoniously
achieved this status... well, when
I first heard the news Saturday af-
ternoon, I was stunned. A slight
but unashamed tear even started
forming itself until I remembered
that football is:-only a game. But
what the heck. It's a game that I
love, and there were better ways
for this stately man to be relieved
of his well—served post than to be
tossed aside by a cold business-
decision coup.

Especially in the cold of Febru-
ary, when football is out of sea-
son and the spotlight isn't nearly
as bright.

This won't really sink in until
September.

I never really was a fan of the
Dallas Cowboys, hated them
when I was little. Actually, it was
probably more resentment than
anything — Dallas had achieved
much more success than my
favorite team was enjoying at the
time —— but I0-year-olds don't
really distinguish between hate
and resentment, especially when

which do not have to be dealt
with at the other EWL schools.

Fan support by nature breeds
publicity. Penn State brought its
newspaper writers and pho-
tographers, its 200 fans and a live
radio broadcast to Fitzgerald
Field House when the team faced
Pitt. '

There were three tour buses
outside that night to accommo-
date all the people who made the
journey from State College.

Stottlemyer looks forward to
the day when something like that
may occur at Pitt. H

, ”We’re in the top 20 every
year, we usually . have good

recruiting, and we workreal hard -

to be where we areevery year,”
Stottlemyer said. '9
”As long as we keep doing

that, our day in the public J

limelight will come.”

it comes to the adored NFL.

Dallas was the runner-up to
Pittsburgh in the naming of the
Team of the '70s. The Cowboys
had their hard-earned chances at
the title, but Super Bowls X and
XIII both went in the Steelers’
favor. Ooh, if only Jackie Smith
had held on to that pass...

The old Cowboys still hold a
grudge.

The league's remaining patri-
archs, which include Landry,

 

Chuck Noll and Don Shula, have

fallen on hard times as of late.
Landry is the first of the magnifi-
cent ’70s triumvirate to exit the

losing campaigns over the last
three seasons. They've made
hlundering mistakes while play-
ing down among the NFL’s worst
teams. The hated Redskins now
beat them regularly.

In I988, the team finished a
shocking 3-1 3 and now owns the
first pickin this year's draft, a du-
bious benefit.

The Dallas fans, tough as any
city's, have stood right behind
Landry through the rough times.

And booed their hearts out.

On Saturday, owner Bum
Bright sold the team to an Arkan-
sas oilman named Jerry Jones for
$140 million. Jones happens to
be great friends with that pillar of
boorishness, Jimmy Johnson,
head coach of the University of
Miami team. The two were room-
mates in college and teammates
on Arkansas’ national champion-
ship team, and have stayed close
ever since. Jones correctly
regards Johnson as being an ex-
traordinary football mind.

And now Johnson — the man
who was personally in charge of
the guerrillas (and gorillas) who

embarrassed the committee of _

the 1987 Fiesta Bowl, the man
who has as many class bones in
his whole body as Tom Landry
has in his right hand, the man
who even ran up the score
against Notre Dame — is the new
head coach of the Dallas
Cowboys. _ -'

Stature-wise, it is a step down’
for the organization.

One thing for sure, though:
Johnson is a winner. There's

- The love affair between Landry,
who is now 64, and professional
football is now over. It may be a
necessary thing for the future suc-
cess of the team, but it is also a
very sad thing. It is highly unlike-
ly that he'll ever be rehired to
coach again, due to his age and
loyalties.

”I wouldn't think» I would
coach again, because it would
just be hard, not being in the
Cowboys‘ blue,” he said. ”Peo-
ple will forget me pretty quick."

But as for the way the old
coach's dismissal was handled, it
was in cold blood. Even after all
the years and all the wins and all
the excitement. Business, you
see, has no memory.

Tom. And walk out of your emp-
