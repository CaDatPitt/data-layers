New dorm

completed,

students
move in

Kathleen Fennell
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

Freshman students will reap
the beneﬁts of the construction
upperclassmen have endured when
they move into Nordenberg Hall
this semester. ‘

In October 2011, the Property
and Fagilities Committee of the
University of Pittsburgh’s Board
of Trustees approved’ the con-
struction of N ordenberg Hall. The
10-story building was projected to
cost $59 million and the renova-
tions are ﬁnally complete, just in
time for students to move in for’
the fallsemester.

The dorm will hold 543 fresh-
manstudents, along with 16 resi-
dent-assistants. Each ﬂoor is di-
videdinto a North and South wing‘
and h£s“72 beds. Every wing has
its own common bathroom, and
ﬂoors will be divided into wings
by gender depending on the enroll-
ment ratio each year. ' j

The building. —- which was
designed by Mackey Mitchell Ar-
chitects of St. Louis along with
MacLachlan, Cornelius & Filoni
Inc., a Pittsburgh ﬁrm — has eight
residential ﬂoors. The ﬁrst ﬂoor
is a retail space including a PNC
Bank, and the second ﬂoor now
houseséithe University’s Wellness
Center.

» "Vice Provost and Dean of Stu-
dents Kathy Humphrey said that
she was happy to open the Wellness

Center in a building _that honors ‘

Chan _ “or Mark A. Nordenberg.
“We ‘are thrilled to be able to
move into a convenient, Univer-
sity—owned wellness facility that
will enable us to better serve our
students,” Humphrey said in an
email. H L '
— Eriﬂaskin, an incoming fresh-

man from Newtown, Pa., plans to v

major in biology and y
will live in Nordenberg Hall

this year.

‘ Medical students open free clinic totreat skin disorders

Mahita Gajanan
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Joel Wolf, a,Pitt medical student who co-
founded a free dermatology clinic last
October, said the model for his free clinic
works because diagnosing skin condi-
tions'usually doesn’t require expensive
equipment. ‘

“The whole point of-dermatology is
that you diagnose with your eyes,” Wolf
said.

Wolf, a third—year medical student,
and Tory Steen, another student at Pitt’s
School ofMedicine, developed and estab-
lished the Student Dermatology for the
Underserved,‘a free dermatology clinic
that runs at thesquirrel Hill Health Cen-
ter every six to eight weeks, usually on
Tuesday evenings. The clinic sees be-
tween lo and 20 patients at eachsession.

Although doctors oversee the clinic,
it’s entirely student—run, which offers an
opportunity for medical students to fulﬁll
their community service requirement
and also gain a deeper understanding of
dermatology. Depending on the schedules
of those involved, a session will see about

_ two to four overseeing doctors, two to

three residents and two to six students.

Students study dermatology for about
a" week in an online class at the School of
Medicine, Steen said. “It’s not covered in-

depth: much at all, which is fine because
only one person in a class out of 150 is
going to go into dermatology,” Steen said.

For three weeks this summer,
the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union ﬁlled with the laughter, mu-
sic, art and animation of young
adults from local refugee com-
munities.

Two campus organizations
teamed up forthe first time to cre-
ate the Pittsburgh Refugee Youth
Summer Enrichment Academy for
25 refugees between the ages of 12
and 16. Fromjuly 29 to August 16,
the 25 participants in the PRYSE
Academy attended educational
and creative workshops and went
on ﬁeld trips.

The PRYSE Academy was a col-

laboration between the advocacy

groups, Keep it Real andvFacili—
tating Opportunities for Refugee
Growth and Empowerment, both

of which tutor youth in local refu— V

gee communities.
Co-directors Alicia Quebral

‘ andjenna Baron graduated from

Pitt lasthspring and were the presi-
dents of FORGE and Keep it Real,

respectively, when they teamed A.

up in April to develop a summer
program to help young refugees.
Participants came from the

Republic of the Congo, a country ‘i

in West Africa; Bhutan, a small
country in the Himalays; and Ke-
nya and Somalia, both countries
in East Africa, Baron said.
Neither the young refugees

who attended the PRYSE Academy .
nor their familieshad to pay any .
fees or costs, according to Que— '
bral. Instead, the program raised '
b about $4,000, both from idonorsj
within Pitt and through donations -

from local service organizations
and charities. A

In order to help these young if '

refugees face some of these chal:
lenges, the camp included career,
academic and college preparation
workshops.

“[H}osting this at Pitt gets S

these kids surrounded by an aca-
demic environment, gets them

ogy major Sarah Khalbuss, said. -“A

“Universities around are asking so much of

wrote in an email. “[A] refugeestudent and
a foreign student coming to study in the U.S.
need to be judged differently.”

She added that she hoped the PRYSE Acad-

CLINIC

Wolf came up with the idea of Stu-
dent Dermatology for the Undeserved
after shadowing ophthalmologists at the
Birmingham Free Clinic in South Side.
He saw that doctors, residents and stu-
dents worked together to bring in eye
equipment and complete eye exams and
realized that the same could be done for
dermatology.

Wolftook the idea to Steen. When they
reached out to doctors at the School of
Medicine’s dermatology department,"
they found a lot of support. Wolf real-
ized that because biopsies and finding

services of Jonhan Ho, director of the
Dermatopathology Unit and a professor
in the departments of dermatology and

, pathology at Pitt. As a d.ermatopatholo-

gist, Ho analyzes biopsy results under a
microscope and makes diagnoses based
on his judgment. After he makes the
‘diagnosis, the attending dermatologist
decidesthe course of action. _

Though he does not work directly with

I" the patients, Ho reads a lot of slides --

0

about 10 from each clinic he works with

—— and makes a portion of diagnoses.
“It’s getting used, so in that respect, I

think it’s effective,” Ho said of the clinic

‘ Steen and Wolf created. __

/.

Steen said he and Wolf were very
fortunate to have previous models for
their clinic. There are many different
student-run volunteer groups through
the School of Medicine. She and Wolf
modeled the dermatology clinic on the
previously established Guerilla Eye Ser-
vice, a free eye-care service also provided
through SHHC.

' Wolf and Steen brought together stu-
dents, residents and attending physicians
— attendings — and developed a plan. To
put the clinic into action, the students
needed a space, and Wolf found it after
attending a lecture by Andrea Fox, chief
medical officer at.SHHC. Fox was inter-

ested in Wolf and Ste’en’s idea and.helped .

themlsort out insurance issues and start
the clinic at SHHC. _ L

In the 10 months that the clinic has
operated, student volunteers have diag-
nosed lupus, small melanomas, benign
skin cancers and other diseases. Patients
come to the dermatology clinic after re-
ceiving recommendations from primary
care doctors who: work in general care
at SHHC.. — ‘

Wolf said the work he and the students
do at the clinic is interesgting because
they often have to think of novel ways
to treat patients. ‘ - '

Although diagnoses are inexpensive,
treating skin disorders does cost money.
Because the patients are uninsured and
the clinic has limitedfunds, doctors at
the clinic don’t'a1ways have access to
certain medications. According to Wolf,
certain topical creams and steroids are

‘readily available, but more specialized
medicine is hard to come by.

“I had a patient with chronic urti-

_ carial,” Wolf said. “It’s ‘an, inflammatory

disease, and there are certain drugs that g

' are out there now that have just come out
in the last coupleyears. They are very
expensive, so we used a different regimen
of over-the-counter allergy medications

‘to deal with it.”

Wolf said that these more difficult
processes give students a deeper aware-
ness of alternative ways to treat patients.

“It’s a win~win for everybody,” Wolf
said. “The students get hands-on expe-
rience, ‘and the uninsured patients get
specialized care.” I A

Pitt, UPMC form partnerships with developing nation

Natalie Daher
Assistant News Editor

The grand opening ofa medical
school in a central Asian coun-
try could influence the way Pitt
operates its own medical school
and cancer treatment practices.

In July, the Pitt School of
Medicine solidiﬁed a partner-
ship with the Nazarbayev Uni-
versity in Kazakhstan to open its
first medical school in the capi-
tal city of Astana by 2015. Un-
der the agreement, Pitt will help
Kazakhstan develop a four—year,
Western-style medical school
that has yet to be constructed.
Additionally, UPMC finalized
the arrangement last summer

. to develop a national oncology

treatment and research center
in Kazakhstan. .

“We’ve really been joined

at the hip,” Charles Bogosta,
UPMC’s vice president, said.
“For the most part of the activ-
ities that have gone overseas,
UPMC and the Pitt School of
Medicine work very closely to-
gether.”

For Pitt medical students and‘
faculty, the partnership will pro-
vide a new cultural perspective
on medical education, a humani-
tarian contribution and diversi-
fied knowledge on medicine to

channel toward Pitt’s own fu-
ture advancements, according
to Steven Kanter, vice dean of
.the School of Medicine.

Other future opportunities
could include an exchange or a
study_abroad program, but they
are not yet developed.

“The process of having an op-
portunity to think about the best
way to design a curriculum when
nothing exists is also giving us
some ideas about how we might
do things somewhat differently
and some improvements that

we might be able to make,” said

Margaret McDonald, associate
vice chancellor for academic af-
fairs andhealth sciences. “It’s
just stretching our thinking.”
Not only does building from
the ground up affect Pitt’s ap-
proach to education, but it
changes the approach to medical
care as a whole. Countries with
more limited resources than the
U.S. might be able to provide in-
sight on cheaper and, perhaps,
more effective ways to tackle
medical issues, including cancer.
“With limited resources, you
have to be a little more efficient
than we’ve been able to,” said
Bogosta. “It’s like starting with a

clean sheet‘ of paper rather than ’

ﬁxing what you already have.”_

The Deal

Nazarbayev University se-
lected Pitt’s School of Medicine
for its international renown in
both research and education.
Nazarbayev is still fairly new,
but the university has essentially

“With lirnited
resources, you have
to be a little more
efficient than 'we’ve

been able to.”

Charles Bogosta

been the pioneer behind Kazakh

scientiﬁc advancements in its

three—year existence.
According to an article writ-

ten by Almaz Sharrnan, a for- '

mer Nazarbayez deputy CEO for
medicine, and published in Pitt’s
Central Asian Journal of Global
Health, Kazakhstan passed a law
last year aimed at dramatically
improving its scientiﬁc research

priorities, including the life
sciences. Funding for research
subsequently increased by 40
percent to an equivalent of $331
million from 2011 to 2012.
Both the Embassy of Kazakh-
stan in Washington, D.C., and
Nazarbayev University did not
respond to interview requests
seeking a Kazakh perspective.
Pitt’s initial activities with
the university pertained solely
to research collaboration upon
its opening,‘according to Mc-

Donald. In the years following,

negotiations about the medical
school took the relationship be-
tween the two universities ‘in a
new direction.

, “It gives both [Pitt and
UPMC] a much larger global
footprint, which ultimately puts
them in a positionito improve
their reputation,” said Bogosta.
f‘You might think it’s only an ex-
port of our capabilities, but it
ends up being an exchange.”

While N azarbayev University
will‘ fully cover the monetary ex-
penses of the endeavor, both Pitt

and UPMC will exert an oppor-

tunity cost, or time and energy
that could be channeled toward
something else. Both institu-
tions will also contribute intel-
lectual property to the project.

Since this is NU’s first medi-

cal school, Pitt will assist with
all of the nuts and bolts: faculty

appointment and promotion, _

policies for student admission,
retention and promotion, con-
struction of a well—equipped
building to house the new medi-
cal school and designing and
implementing the curriculum,
according to Kanter. .
Communication between
the two universities will occur
through visits, video confer-
ences, Skype calls and individual
phone calls. _
. But this isn’t UPMC’s first trip
overseas.
The center has played a role

in managing a hospital, cancer.

center or emergency department
in about 20 differentcountries,

including Italy, Ireland and Qa-

tar, over the last 15 years, Bo-
gosta said.

Butthis will be Pitt Medical
School’s first hands—on involve-
ment in the construction of a
new-medical school from step
onefaccording to McDonald,
which will ideally bolster the
University’s global recognition
as a whole. A

“In‘today’s world, which is

getting smaller and smaller, ~

better health for any one of us
means better health for all of
us,” Kanter said in an email. I

Students, educators debate effectiveness of high school AP courses

Shruti Revankar
Staff Writer

As another school year starts, thou-
sands of Pitt undergrads ﬂood the
campus, many of them heading to
theirﬁrst college class. These particu-
lar ﬁrst-year students are certainly
hoping that the years of tireless ef-
fort they dedicated to their Advanced
Placement classes inhigh schoolwill
give them the boost they need to suc-
ceed.

AP classes are nothing new. De-
veloped in the 1950s, the Advanced
Placement Programwas designed to
provide high school students with
rigorous courses in order to prepare
them for college.

Arleen Wheat, assistant super-
intendent of special education and

pupil services forthe NorthAllegheny '

School District, said she believes that
AP and honors’ courses are very im-
portant for students to take in prepa-

ration for college-level courses. But’

she conceded that there is a trade-
off where these high-level classes are
concerned. ‘

“In order for school districts to

offer AP and honors courses, there
would need to be ‘more teachers
available to teach the courses and
therefore a larger budgetis needed,”
Wheat said. .

In the North Allegheny School
District, there are more than 50
honors courses and 20 AP courses
offered. About 550 students take one
or more AP courses each year, accord-
ing to Wheat. g

Students at Pitt seem to have

mixed feelings ab out the effectiveness
of taking AP classes in high school.
‘ Kaitlin Augustine, a sophomore
ﬁnance and marketing major, took
three AP classes at Moon Area High
School, which is located west of
Pittsburgh and is part of Moon Area
School District.

Augustine said that by taking

AP’classe's, she was somewhat pre-
pared because she realized that col-

lege courses would be much harder

_ and that she would have to balance

multiple college-level classes at once.

Upon entering college, shefelt as if
AP classes weren’t as effective as she

thought they would be.

“EvenbeinganAP—honors student
in high school, Ifelt like I didn’t know
how to study once I began college,”
Augustine said.

Although Matthew Pulleo, asoph—
omore chemical engineering major,
took seven AP classes at Blackhawk
High School in the Blackhawk School
District, he felt that only afewof them
helped. Although he thought thatAP
English was a great class for essay-
writingpreparation, and AP calculus

was an asset when tackling rigorous » '
- math courses, he foundAP chemistry

to be the most rewarding.

“AP chemistry prepares you amaz-
ingly for college chemistry, giving you’
a solid background to a course many
majors have to-take,” Pulleo said.

' Unfortunately, AP classes are‘

not in abundance at all high schools

~ across the Pittsburgh area. According

to Betsy D’Ernidio, assistant principal
at East Allegheny High School, the
school only offers pre—AP English, AP
English and AP history. This upcom-
ing school year, only 63 of nearly 600
students attending the high school
are enrolled in these advanced classes
and each ofthe 63 only plan ontaking
one section per semester. ‘
Despite the lack of AP courses of-
fered at her high school, D’Ernidio
does not believe itwill hinder college
readiness in her students. “Our cur-

riculumisveryrigorous,andteachers '

work extra hard to make sure stu-
dents are prepared to move on to the
next level,” she said.

Katie Rose, a sophomore major-
ing in both administration of justice
and legal studies, didn’t take any AP
classes in high school. Although she

expected college to be difficult be- 1 '

cause of her inexperience regarding

A college-level courses, she found that ’
3 college  easier than expected. '

“I’m more of a lecture person. I

‘ do much better if given little to no as-

signments becauseIworkﬁill—time,”
Rose said.

Jessica Lee, an incoming fresh-
man, took 10 AP classes at Cones-
toga High School, which is part of
the Tredyffrin-Easttown School Dis-
trict. Although she has heard various
opinions onAP courses, she remains
positive. .

Lee said she liked that taking
AP classes allowed her to enter her
freshman year with a large amount

« of college credit.

“I’ve been exempted from a large
number of gen-eds, allowing me to
double major-minor and possibly
pick up a certiﬁcate,” she said.

Lee believes that the AP courses

' offered at her high school were suc-

cessfully designed to strengthen stu-
dents’ time management skills.
‘_‘Our curriculum does prepare

most students well for college, and

I have learned how to take notes and

Survey: Pitt a favorite place to
work for scientiﬁc researchers

Gideon Bradshaw I
News Editor

A recent survey suggests that Pitt is a
favored employer among scientists.
Earlier this month, The Scientist, a
magazine for professionals in the life sci-
ences, published the results of an online
survey that ranked scientiﬁc researchers’
levels of satisfaction with noncommercial
employers. Pitt’s fourth—place ranking
this year represents an improvement
from thelresults of last year’s version of
the same survey, in which it placed 14th.
But it’s unclear how well the survey rep-

- —- resents the whole scientific community.

Pitt was the most highly rated univer-
sity on the list. The

their rankings.

Akst also said she was uncertain how
much self-selection on the part of re-
spondents affected the survey’s results,
explaining that the magazine has only
recruited respondents for its surveys
that way.

Although the magazine included cave-
ats in the survey’s results, it felt conﬁdent
that the responses to the survey gave a
good indication of the general climate
in the scientiﬁc community.

“[I]t’s clear that scientists value any
form of financial and research support
they can get from their employers. Three
out of the top four institutions scored
highly on questions relating to ‘Infra-

structure and Envi-

three institutions
ranked above it are-
research institutes.

_ “We are ex-
tremely pleased
to ‘be recognized
as one of the best
places to work in
academia,” Pitt
Provost and Senior
Vice Chancellor Pa-
tricia Beeson said
in a statement the
University released
in response to the
survey.

The magazine
based its rankings
on responses to a
survey. it posted
online from 1,249
users who identi-
fied themselves as

ronrnent,’ and two
got high marks for
‘Research Resourc-
es,’” the news staff
for The Scientist
wrote in the article
discussingthe sur-
vey’s results.
Scientists at Pitt
who responded
identified “pay”
and “infrastructure
and environment”
as Pitt’s strengths.
For them, “teach-
ing and mentoring”
and “management
and policies”iwere
their employer’s
weaknesses.
. The survey
asked respondents
to rate on a scale

at noncommercial
research institutions. It included only
responses from those scientists who iden-
tiﬁed the institution where they worked.
The Scientist took pains to publish
some important caveats to its results.
Although the number of respondents ex-
ceeded the 1,000 that statisticians usually
look for in order to consider a sample
representative of a large group of people,
the scientists who responded to the sur.—
vey did so voluntarily. Thus, they might
not be representative of all scientists.

It’s also important to note that for
some of the institutions, the number of
respondents might have been small, pre-
venting the results from being statisti-
cally accurate. The magazine éd not list
how many scientists responded from each
separate research institution.

]efAkst, a senior editor for The Scien-
tist, wrote in an email that the magazine
did not include institutions from which
fewer than ﬁve researchers responded in

from one to five
- how stronglythey
agreed with positive statements about
their institution in eight separate cat-
egories. In addition to the categories
already mentioned, the survey also in-
cluded statements about “job satisfac-
tion,” “peers” and “tenure and promo-
tion.” Respondents could also choose to
rate a statement as irrelevant.
Pitt administrators did not respond to
a request for comment about whether the
survey’s results could affect any speciﬁc
University policies, whether they agreed
with this assessment of Pitt’s strengths
and weaknesses was accurate and wheth-
er they knew why Pitt jumped from 14th

' to fourth place in just one year.

But in Pitt’s ofﬁcial statement, Beeson
attributed the fourth—place rating to the
way the University treats its researchers.

“As an institution, we strive to remem-
ber that placing a high value on scientiﬁc
research means valuing those who con-
duct it,” she said. I H '

Researchers develop model for gels that react to light

Gideon Bradshaw

News Editor» -

Anna Balazs, a researcher whose work
often deals with synthetic materials that
respond to external stimuli, said she of-
ten nicknames her projects.

In a research project she conducted

previously, she and her team named the —

computerized simulation of a material
whose behavior she was modeling, “Sey-
mour.”

The name was a reference to “Little
Shop of Horrors,” a film featuring a sing-
ing, man-eating plant. S

Balazs, a distinguished professor of
chemical engineering, and Olga Kukse-
nok, a research associate professor in
Pitt’s Swanson School of-Engineering,
published a study late last month in the
journal “Advanced Functional Materi-
als.” In the study, which was the first
of its kind, they demonstrated that a
certain synthetic gels will change their
shape based on their exposureto light. A
grant from the U.S. Department of Energy
funded the research. '

The researchers wrote in the study

that some living organisms‘ can change ,
their physical shapes and even their col- ,

ors in response to their environments.
Synthetic materials that change their
shape could have useful applications in
the medicaland other ﬁelds. l _
During an interview, Balazs pointed
to the Indonesian mimic octopus as an
example of this type of “biomimetic”
behavior she finds particularly compel-
ling.’In order to deter predators or trick
prey, the octopus changes its shape to

imitate snakes, crabs, jellyﬁsh and other‘

creatures.

“[The mimic octopus] does it for its A

own survival,” she said. “So the question
is, could we get synthetic materials to un-

dergo such dramatic changes in shape?”
Using computer simulations, Kukse-

nok and Balazs used hydrogels, a family

of gels used in contact lenses and other
medical devices. The gels" were made from
chemical compounds that contained spi-
robenzopyran chromophores, a type of
particle that reacts to light. .

While spirobenzopyran chro mopho res
can mix with water when they are not
exposed to light, blue light causes them to
become repelled by water. When chemical
compounds-contain these particles, the
presence of light can change the shape
of the gels. ‘ A '

Balazs said that in order to manipu-
late these gels, one would repeatedly
run a light over the surface of the gel
similarly to t e way someone would scan
the surface with a ﬂashlight. When the
chromophores are exposed to blue light,
they move away from thewater contained
in the gel, bringing the other non-water

‘ contents of the gel with them.

This causes the gels to swell or shrink,
according to Balazs’ and Kuksenok’s ar-
ticle. The effects also vary depending on
the intensity of the light that reaches the
surface of the gel. '

The researchers wrote in their article
that living organisms often change color
and shape-in response to their environ-
‘ments. Research into gel compounds that

V ‘ can dynamically change their shape holds
-. important implications for manyfields.

Balazs said diagnostic medicine is one

  S’ such ﬁeld.

Hydrogels are used_ in an emerging
technology called. microfluidics, .the
precise control of quantities:less than a
millimeter in volume.

One area in microﬂuidics is “lab—on—a—
chip technology” that aims at streamlin-
ing diagnostic testing by enabling techni-
cians to conduct multiple tests using a
single sample. In order to conduct tests
this way, ‘technicians need to be able to
move tiny amounts of blood around on
the chips. A . '

Balazs said her work, which could al-

low technicians to use light to manipulate

‘the’ surfaces of the chips to move blood
samples around on them used in these
diagnostic procedures, might have ap-
plications for microfluidics.

A“Now, if you’re swiping the light over
[the surface of the chip], you’re not only
moving the blood cells, but you’re creat-
ing little elevators and coriveyer belts
that direct the movement of those cells,”
she said.

This would make diagnostic proce-
dures that used to require a medical
laboratory moreportable and available
to medical professionals in places where
extensive testing facilities are not avail-
able. Such places include battlefields and
developing countries where infrastruc-
ture is limited. I

MLK Project brightens Oakland streets, lives of youth

Local youth participated in a five-weekprogramlto create murals depicting themes selected by’ the Oakland community.

Megan Trimble
Managzbzg Editor

When a 14-year-old Pittsburgh
resident named Dell walked into
The Bridge of Pittsburgh, a youth
development center, and high-
fived Beth Crawford, she couldn’t
believe her eyes.

“He came to pick up his first
check and said, ‘What’s up, Miss
Beth?"He had opened up and
blossomed, and all I could think
was, ‘Is this the same young
man‘?’” Crawford said.

Dell’s story, Crawford said,
represents the transformation
that can stem from two simple
things: art and the MLK Project.

The Moving the Lives of Kids
Community Mural Project, a
nonproﬁt foundedin 2007 that
focuses on arts, youth develop-
ment and education, partnered
with funders, local artist Olga
Brindar, the Oakland Planning
,and Development Corporation
and 10 participants from The
Bridge of Pittsburgh.

The project worked to com-
plete two massive murals on the
side of Oakland properties locat-

ed on Semple Street earlier this
month. The murals, which were
developed during a five—week
program run through MLK Mu-

rals fromjuly 8 to Aug. 9, feature '

a green theme that ‘was voted on
by the Oakland community.

“Pitt plays a definite role in
Oakland, but there’s a large part
of the community that is not Pitt-
centered,” Gene Ojeda, artist and
MLK Project mural coordinator,
said. “For example, Oakland has
a rich cultural presence and resi-
dents want to reflect that.”

The project aimed to instill a
sense of pride and accomplish-
ment in at-risk youth while shar-
ing a passion for art and captur-
i_ng Oakland’s community voice.

The community voice is now
represented through vibrant
images and blended colors that
create depictions of community
members enjoying the outdoors
and each other’s company.

Rebekkah Ranallo, a spokes-
woman for OPDC, said the com-
munity group first partnered
with the MLK Project in 2010
to paint the Oakland mural on
Atwood Street. The murals, she

said, fit with the community
beautifying aspect of the Oak-
land 2025 Master Plan.

“Semple Street is highly trav-
eled by pedestrians, bikes and
cars,” Ranallo said. “OPDC be-
lieves that with simple invest-
ments and care, we can improve
the conditions on this highly
traveled Central Oakland cor-
ridor.” I
The investments in the proj-
ect target dim areas of commu-
nity and work to produce art that
reflects and engages residents in
the hopes of creating a stronger
community force.

“They physically put their

.own sweat into this project and

into this piece of art, and they
took away a sense of pride, dig-
nity and community worth,”
‘Ojeda said of the youth, most of
whom road two busses to get to
Oakland each day.

The Bridge of Pittsburgh
gathered the project’s youth
participants through different
outlets. A portion of the youth
participated through the Pitts-
burgh Summer Youth Employ-
ment Program. The city’s pro-

» gram ‘catered to young adults

between 14 and-21 years old.
Another portion of the youth»
came from The Bridge of Pitts-
burgh’s employment program.
This program was comprised of_
Bridge members, youth associ-
ated with the foster care system

.between the ages of 16 and 21 .'

years old.

The mural provided several of
the participants with their first
experiences with art and with a
job. Each logged full—time work
weeks and receivea stipend after
completing timesheets, progress
reports and other responsibili-
ties associated-withd summer
jobs._ ' ‘V

Brindar, 26‘, has lived in Pitts-
burgh for 21 years, graduated
from Carnegie Mellon,University
with an art degree in 2009 and
originally saw the opportunity
as a chance for artistic expo-
sure in the community. She was

surprised to find, her niche in‘

teaching art and giving back to
the community.

“Eventually, the mural be-
came a secondary thing for me,”
she said. “It wasn’t the typical

LaKesha Silver | MLK Project staff

a

type of art that I do as an artist,
not to say that I didn’t enjoy it,
but it just became more about
the kids and about sharing my
passion for art.”

Neighborhood nonprofits,
«including Schools 2 Career and
the Family House, allowed the
project to use their facilities
and space to store art supplies.
According to Ranallo, property
owners Chuck Perlick and Rob-
ert Eckenrode also partnered
with OPDC by donating funds
to complete the murals on their
properties. The Oakland Green
Team led the community process
to review and select designs for
each mural. .

Those involved with the proj-
ect mentored the youth to ease
“any estrangement the youth felt

_ publicly and with their commu-

nities,” Ojeda said.

The curriculum stressed
that there are several forms of
art and that it provides an out-
let for thoughts and emotions,
but while the artists have their
own artistic voice, Ojeda said

the projects aim to reflect the ‘neighbor?

“The mural may make some people

stop and say, ‘Hey, I’m gonna look up as '

I walk down this block.’ It’s just an orna-

ment, but at the end ofthe day it does so

Brindar taught the youth from an art

Crawford said the project wasn’t one
that merely “enabled the youth, but one
that also empowered them,” which al-

-lowed her to “watch the young people go ‘

through a metamorphosis.”

The changes in the participants came
as a compounded result of hard work,
positive community feedback and an old

While she was wel1—aware of the issues .

related to economic and racial disparity,
Brindar said she was surprised by the
responsibility she felt workingwith the
youth and hearing theirstories.

' “There were histories of neglect, abuse
andsome whojust hadn’t been exposed to

art,” she said. “I realized just how deserv—.

ing these kids are. So many people had
disappointed these kids, and I refused to
be one ofthem.”

' For Brindar, the group’s hard work was s

measured in pencils, the majority of which
were nubs of wood against erasers by the
end of the project.

Similar murals can be found across

Weight  a risk, butnot inevit_able,for incomingﬁeshmen

Elizabeth Furiga
Sta ﬂ I/Vriter

Along with roommate troubles, adjusting to
dorm life, and college work, the possibility
of the “freshman 15” presents anxiety for
incoming freshman. This term was coined
for the weight gained by incoming college
students due to the life changes presented
by college.

Although students do tend to put on some
weight when they ﬁrst_start school, health
experts say that students can control this

gain through exercise’ and diet. At least one
organization at Pitt helps students who want
to ‘keep off those extra pounds, or students
can make those lifestyle choices on their own.

Johnjakicic, a professor and chair of the
Department of Health and Physical Activ-
ity in Pitt’s School of_Education, said the
term freshman 15 exaggerates the amount
of weight most students gain.

“The average student does not gain 15
pounds. Research shows it’s a much smaller
amount. When kids enter college there’s a
tendency for them to gain weighthowever
the vast majority of studiesdo not support

  R AND a    R  r    

that magnitude of weight gain,7’Jakicic said. ' it

According to Jakicic, weightgain can af-

fect upperclassmen, too. But for freshmen, '
the ﬁrst year is a big bump in their lives that ‘
involves many changes where students now '
control their own meals and face many social '

situations revolving around food.

Transitioning from high school to college
changes how students eat when they go from
their parents’ tables to all-you-can-eat dining
halls. The changes in activities and eating
habits causes weight gain. Many students
also look to food as an outlet to relieve stress
and anxiety, Jakacic said.

   

 

Alcohol also .contributes to weight gain
during the ﬁrst year in postsecondary school.
Many students consume alcohol, which con-
tains a substantial number of calories, while
in college. These ‘extra calories can add to
weight gain. W i if 

Jakacic said there are ways to avoid gain-
ing weight, even in an all—you—can-eat dining
hall. ; . l

“Every dining hall has the good stuff and
the bad stuff you need to understand where
the healthier lower calorie stuff is and gravi-
tate towards it,” he said. “But you can eat too
much salad and gain weight.”

He went on to explain that students should
be careful not to overeat. Even with seemingly

healthy food, students need to be careful

about keeping portions reasonably sized.
The website for Pitt’s Dining Services in-
cludes links to online resources meant to help
consumers make healthy eating choices and
maintain suitable ﬁtness regimens.
Representatives for Dining Services were
unavailable for further comment.

 

 

Jakacic also stressed the importance of
exercise to reduce weight gain and decrease
stress. ’ *-

One group on campus that will become ac-
tive this fall semester is telling women to\“eat
clean, train dirty” in order to avoid the weight
gain associated with enrolling in college.

Changing Health Attitudes and Actions
to Recreate Girls, or CHAARG, hopes to help
women on campus to eat healthy and train
hard to avoid the freshman 15 and other un-
necessary weight gain.

Katie Martin, the president of CHAARG,
explained how the group hopes to help wom-

en in eating healthier and avoiding weight‘

gain.

“It’s predominantly about diet. If you eat
things that you do n’t know what’s in them it’s
not good for you. We want to teach girls to
read nutrition labels and avoid preservatives

‘' and added colors and dyes as well as make

them aware of what goes into their food and
what’s healthiest for their goals,” Martin said.

She also weighed in on the idea of the
freshman 15 and whether it really happens

' to most students.

“I think it’s a reality. I totally gained the
freshman 15 and some of my friends did. You
go to the Quick Zone //do we need to deﬁne

- Quick Zone? online, it looks like it’s some?

thing in the Towers// and they give yousoda
and chips. The easy quick things are easy mac
and poptarts. With the added’ stress you want
to go to the unhealthy junk food. It’s really
hard to adapt to not making your own food
at home,” she said. '

Martin said that CHAARG wants to show i

girls they can eat well and train hard. A14
though lifting weights is a male-dominated
area of ﬁtness, CHAARG also wants to en-

courage more women to try it. The group

hopes to help girls realize their nutrition
and activity goals- and avoid Weight gain in
the process.

Protecting water resources remain a major concern for environmental activist groups.

Raechelle Landers
For The Pitt News

Some local environmental orga-
nizations say that Pittsburgh’s
sewer system, which combines
the sewage and stormwater tun-
nels, is outdated. Although‘ the
system is used to ensure sani-
tation, it can no longer handle
the city’s sewage in a way that
prevents pollution.

“Right now if you ﬂush your

‘toilet it goes straight into~the

river,” Tom Hoffman, an envi-
ronmental activist, said during

an interview that took place -

soon after heavy rainfall.
Allegheny county’s plumb-

‘ing is due for a renovation ac-

cording to the new regulations
to improve water quality set by
the federal Clean Water Act. The

August 20,, 2013 l The Pitt News | mNpwv.pittmevyvs.cpom

U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency issued a consent decree
to municipalities throughout the
nation to update the transporta-
tion and treatment of water in
2008. The perpetual threat of
ﬂooding at the slightest rainfall
makes Pittsburgh a high priority
for improvements.

Some organizations in the

area have formed a coalition
called the Clean Rivers Cam-
paign, which claims to advocate
for an environmentally friendly
update to Pittsburgh’s sewage
system, which currently pollutes
the rivers through runoff. Some
Pitt students and graduates are
ﬁnding employment in these ef-
forts. But, some local sanitation
officials and the city’s govern-
ment are unsure how well the
campaign’s proposals will work

‘-(.1 .

as a means to upgrade the area’s
sewer system. .

Time for an Update

Hoffman, the western Penn-
sylvania director of the environ-
mental activist organization
Clean Water Action, said that
Pittsburgh’s sewers worked
well when they were built in
the 1950s.

But because the city has de-
veloped since then, they can no
longer handle both runoff from
rainfall and household sewage
waste, according to Hoffman.
Pavement now covers more of
the city than 60 years ago, which
means that less rainfall is ab-
sorbed into the ground.

Officials in the area’s sanita-
tion departments agreed with
Hoffman’s position but said they
disagreed with some of Hoff-

A man’s position.

Nancy Barylak, a spokes-
woman for the ‘Allegheny
County Sanitary Authority, or
ALCOSAN, also said Hoffman’s

statement regarding wastewater A

was not true. During rainy con-
ditions when lines become ﬁlled
to capacity, runoff from rainfall
dilutes the sewage.

Guillermo Cole, a spokes-
man for the Allegheny County

Health Department, said that «

the Allegheny County Sanitary
Authority provides wastewater

, treatment services to most of

the county. Although it pro-
cesses about 250 million gallons
of wastewater a day, this is not
enough when it rains. an
But Cole also said that al-
though 9 billion gallons of un-

treated sewage are discharged .

“It will be signiﬁcantly dilut-
ed with storm water,” said Cole.
Cole also said that it depends on

the community you livein. Some ~

areas have sanitary lines that are
separate from storm water lines
where this wouldn’t'occur unless
the lines were compromised.

But Hoffman remained un-
convinced.

makes it any better,” he said in
response to Cole’s_ and Barlyak’s

Women weigh in on prevalence
A of casual sex on campuses

Em Maier
Assistam.‘ News Editor

College has long been the scene of drunken
encounters and summer ﬂings. Rather than
long-term relationships, certain students

partake in short-term alternatives such as‘ V
friends with beneﬁts, according to media

stereotypes and conventional wisdom.
Many students in university say they
engage in casual, short—term relationships
because they are afraid that long-term com-
mitments might interfere with their careers.

Although society might assume that men are v

more likely than women to look for casual

_ sex, evidence suggests that women might

casually “hook up” as often as or rrloregthan
men.
But members of at least one student or-

ganization at Pitt consider casual sex an

obstacle, not a means, to personal growth.

As a member of the student group Off the

Hook, Emily Blume,

cine, said she thought the group’s efforts
have been popular on campus.

“We provide individuals with condoms
and also use the opportunity to talk about
the clinic, available services the clinic offers,

. promote advocacy and collect contact in-

formation for anyone interested in learning
more about Planned Parenthood or how to
become a volunteer,” Toney said.

The evidence on whether or not hooking
up is all that common at universities —— and
who’s having‘it — is mixed.

Elizabeth Armstrong, a sociologist at the

. University of Michigan, thought the behav-

iors were because of the thought that rela-
tionships were demanding and distracting.
Focusing on self—development and indepen-
dence, Armstrong said, women delay look—
ing for love until later, after they’ve become

established.
Paula England, a sociology professor at
- New York University,

a junior majoring in
English literature,
works to promote
healthy relation-
ships in place of
casual sex.Aclergy- '

“As women become
more indpependeint,

surveyed more than
14,000 students
about hookups, dat-
ing and relationship
experiences. Ac-
cording to a 2010

man from a Catholic V report published in

mersed in a careerist

pone thinking about

own needs.”

quarterly, England
found that most
students don’t hook
up as‘often as con-
ventional wisdom
suggests.

England found

that 80 percent of

students were hook-

marriage and family,

and their lives and _

values are ﬁxated on the workplace,” Blume
said in an email. ' '

Rather than businesslike hookups, Off the
Hook encourages students to have relation-
ships with more permanence and commit-
ment, Blume said. Students can have a ‘‘full,
ﬂourishing college life” without one-night
stands.

But according to another student orga-
nization, the risks of hooking up are more
hygienic than emotional or moral.

Vox: Voices for Planned Parenthood
worksto raise awareness on different aspects
of human sexuality. The student group tries
to do so through lobbying, movie nights,
volunteering at the local Planned Parent-
hood clinic and distributing condoms to
patrons at local bars.

“Our condom crawls tend to be well-
received,” Nicole Toney, the club’s adviser,
said.

Toney, an epidemiologist and researcher
at Pitt’s Department of Critical Care Medi-

ing up an average of

less than once per
semester over the courses of their college
careers.

“Hooking up isn’t the rampant, hedo-
nistic free—for-all portrayed by the media,”
the sociologists who wrote the report on
Eng1and’s study wrote. '

The report also argued that women enjoy
sex more within the context of a relationship.

But Irene Frieze, a Pitt sociologist and re-
searcher, saidsome of her students’ ﬁndings
among peers suggested otherwise.

“A couple of years ago, two‘ different stu-
dents in my interpersonal relations class
were trying to replicate the often-cited tradi-
tional ﬁnding that men weremore interested
in casual sex than women, and neither was
able to do that,” Frieze said. M

She attributed interest in casual sex
among women as a sign of increasing au-
tonomy. ~

“As women become more- independent,
they seem to be more willing to accept their
own _needs,” she said. I

involved in the Clean Rivers Campaign.
The others include the Sierra Club; the
Allegheny Group, a local organization that
works on environmental programs and cam-
paigns; Nine Mile Run Watershed Associa-
tion, which involves community members
in green initiatives; Action United, which
organizes community members with low
or moderate incomes to inﬂuence impor-
tant issues; the Pennsylvania Interfaith
Impact Network, which organizes people
of different religious backgrounds around
social justice issues; and Pittsburgh United,
which works to advance social and economic

justice. ‘ .

The Clean Rivers Campaign proposes that
more green infrastructure could reduce or
prevent sewage runoff into the rivers. For
those involved in the campaign, this would
mean putting in permeable sidewalks and
streets and planting trees and creating more
green spaces. These improvements will stop
the rain where it falls, preventing runoff in a
process that authorities call source control
or reduction,

ALCOSAN initially proposed building
sewer tunnels beneath the rivers, but is now
working on a two—part plan.

The first component would be to add new,
larger lines to the existing ones.

“Not only can they convey ﬂow to us
but also store it,” said Barylak. This means
that the pipelines would convey ﬂow until it
rained. When it rained, the new lines would
be large enough to store the extra stormwa—
ter that the plant would not be able to treat

A all at once.

“We didn’t do anything bad” said Barylak
in regards to what caused the sewage prob-
lem in Pittsburgh.

Before the change in the Federal Water
Act, ALCOSAN and the other sewage treat-
ment plants were operating according to
the law. With the changes in legislation,
however,_.all of the facilities must evolve to
treat more sewage by 2026. She said that
as the largest sewage treatment plant in

the area, ALCOSAN processes 250 million
gallons of sewage a day. The second—largest
plant only processes 10 million gallons of
sewage a day. Because the Federal Clean
Water Act was changed, ALCOSAN must
expand their processing capacity to 480
million gallons a day.

The Wet Weather Plan draft would cost
$3.6 billion and is not federally funded.
All funding for this project will come from
ALCOSAN ratepayers. ALCOSAN is a joint
authority of the city and county that does
not receive tax funds and operates under
state guidelines. They_are working on a plan
whose cost would be closer to $2 billion.

The second component of the plan is
more source control. This is where green
infrastructure will be effective but it’s not
enough to prevent overﬂow on its own.
Source control implements green infrastruc-
ture to stop stormwater where it drops. For
example, if rain falls on a green space it will
be absorbed into the ground, but if it falls
on a sidewalk it will runoff into the streets.

“Green infrastructure will never ever ad-
dress the problem by itself,” said Barylak.

Hoffman agrees with Barylak that green
infrastructure alone wouldn’t be enough to

solve the problem. But ALCOSAN’s initial"

plan did not incorporate any green infra
structure he said. ' 

ALCOSAN requested an extension to
study the issue after community members
suggested it during the public. comment
period. ' _

“We’re not really sure they’re very sincere
about it,” said Hoffman. “We won the battle
but deﬁnitely haven’t won the war yet.”

She said that ALCOSAN has. partnered
with municipalities on source control over
the last-seven years and that it was unfair to
say that ALCOSAN is notgoing to implement
source control. «

ALCOSAN is working closely with the
Pittsburgh Water and Sewage Authority,
which is responsible for operating and main-
taining the city’s sewer system. The PWSA
transports sewage to ALCOSAN for treat-
ment.

- Moving toward a solution

Starting last February, the PWSA and
city of Pittsburgh collaborated to hold three
planning sessions that included engineer-
ing and environmental experts from the
government, nonproﬁt and private sectors,

including at least one organization in the

Clean Rivers Campaign. Last month, the

PWSA published their conclusions after _

these meetings in a 21—page report.

The report points to using some “green”
infrastructure,‘ like parks, to take some of
the burden for_dealing with wastewater off
“gray” infrastructure, which includes sewer
lines and tunnels. M l

The major recommendations agreed
the participants in the sessions included
creating a stormwater utility, a service re-
sponsible for funding the operation and
maintenance of stormwater management
devices. Stormwater management devices‘
include water ﬁltratio_n and detention ba-

Activist group calls for endgito ‘white/A land-grab?   in city”   J 1

Matt Singer
Staﬁ” PV1‘iter

According to local activist Joy
KMT, the move to put others to
work for racialjustice is under-
way.

“If you come, and you’ve
come to do the work with us,
then we work.”

KMT and the rest of the advo-
cacy group, Pittsburgh for Tray-
vonhave, in fact, been working.
Since mid July, the group has
confronted city ofﬁcials, hold-
ing at least one demonstration
and releasing public statements
accusing the city’s institutions of
being racially unjust. While some
city authorities haverespond-
ed to the group’s concerns, the
group says it will keep working
against what it sees as an unjust
status quo.

On Aug. 8, Pittsburgh for
Trayvon _released a “love let-
ter” to the Urban Redevelop-
ment Authority thatplaysa role
in planning development in the
area. The title of the statement
refers to the love Pittsburgh for
Trayvon expresses for the city.

The statement accuses the ’

URA of committingleconomic
violence against African-Amer-

icans in the city, even if their
intentions are not malicious.

. “Despite ourundeniable con-
nection-to this city, we write as

outsiders in our communities, ‘

witnesses to the revitalization
that has been touted as miracu-
lous yet requires that we be in-
visible,” the statement says.
The letter also says Pitts-
burgh for Trayvon intends to go

' beyond exposing development

projects as, “the intentional

creation of blight andthe white '

land—grab.” They want to close
the distance they say exists be-
tween African—Americans and
otherresidents in the city.

KMT, who has changed her_
name legally to give herself what
she identified as a traditional
Egyptian last name, said she and
the rest of the group want to get
the attention of the URA because
Pittsburgh for Trayvon is com-
mitted to the quality of life for
all residents involved.

The group says that the top-
ics covered in the letter range
from the issue of gentriﬁcation,
to institutionalized racism and
white supremacy in Pittsburgh."
It also contains a call for the
URA to end the “economic and
emotional violence” that is felt

by many African-Americans in
the city, referring to the undue
burdens the group states dis-
proportionately feel by black
communities in the city.

URA- spokeswoman Gigi
Saladna said the authority has

invested work and money in re--

vitalzing low-income neighbor;
hoods in the area.

“We encourage City residents
to get involved to improve our
neighborhoods and the quality
of life for all of our residents and
businesses,” she said in an email.

Saladna did_not respond to
requests to elaborate. '

“Generally, what we’ve been
up to is clarifying our intent and
our purpose for coming together
in response to the systemic in-
justices faced by black people,
"especially in Pittsburgh,” said
KMT.

The public statement to the .

URA was not the first time Pitts-
burgh for Trayvon has claimed
that institutions in the city oper-
ate ina way that is racially injust.

On July 17, Pittsburgh for

Trayvon previously delivered _

a list of demands to Mayor Ra— .
' venstahl, City Council President A

Darlene Harris and District 8

City Councilman Bill Peduto,

" who is currently the Democratic

mayoral candidate.

The demands Pittsburgh for
Trayvon delivered at the earlier
demonstration included calls
to end what they claimed.was
racial profiling by law enforce-
ment, to work to ending racial
and social discrimination, to
condemn Zimmerman’s acquit-

tal and to renounce Pittsburgh’s
title as “the mostlivable city”~

until the title equally extended
to African-A'merica.n residents.
The responses that they re-

ceived from elected officials in

the city were were mixed. Peduto
issued a 14-point response. Har-

, ris encouraged the group to draft

a resolution. Ravenstahl said
that he has been working to ad-
dress many of the points raised.

But as the group, whose

’ number of active members has
ranged from 10 to 30 since the

initial rally, is actively expand-
ing its scope and focus. There is

one thing conspicuously absent’ ,

-— a concrete hierarchy.
That, however, isn’t a prob-
lem for members. .-
. “The.group’s structure is cur-

l_ rently amorphous, with many

people contributing in varied
ways,” saidjohnson. “Our group

is led by a kernel of queer women
of color who focus our energy
and message and structure our
meetings and discussions.”
KMT said while'the group
lacks a “hierarchical, top-down
leadership model,” it succeeds
in centering the voices of who
are involved or most affected by
the issues at hand. She said the
group maintains a sort of equity
when it comes to who is in what
position or in charge of what.
On top of lacking a clearly
defihed leadership structure,
the group also currently doesn’t
have a centralized headquarters
and typically meets in members’
households or other‘ available
locations. «
' For members of Pittsburgh
for Trayvon, the verdict of the
Zimmerman trial was latest in

' a long string of injustices they

hope to correct. ,

‘‘It’s not that we arejust black
residents and we’re pissed off
and we have no grounds,” said
KMT. “We are people that live‘
here and have grown up here and
really want to“ see [Pittsburgh]

1 support thewell-being of every--

one.” I

Community members react to court  on same-sex marriage

Cristina Holtzer
For The Pitt News

Although state and federal
authorities are challenging and
eliminating laws against same-
sex marriage, some members of
the community are extremely
unhappy with these develop-
ments. A

“We have essentially re-
moved procreation from mar-
riage,” Robert Lockwood, an
area spokesman for the Catholic

‘ Church, said. He was referring to

American society. “All we’re ef-

' fectively doing is really harming _
marriage and the family which

as a result really, really harms
the society and middle class.”
The Defense of Marriage Act,
which U.S. Congress passed in
1994, held that marriage is “only
a legal union between one man
and one woman as husband and
wife.” It also said that states are

I

not required td recognize the
marriages of same-sex couples
that were performed in other
states or in other countries like
Canada. Pennsylvania’s state
version, which also restricts
marriage to a legal unio_n be-
tween a man and woman, was
passed in 1996. .

But, following the U.S. (Su-
preme Court’s decision over-
turning the federal DOMA in
June, the constitutionality of
Pennsylvania’s version has come
into question.

Campus advocates for the
LGBT community at Pitt, such
as the Rainbow Alliance group,
have hailed the Supreme Court’s
overturning of the federal l_aw as
a “victory.” ‘

According to . Michael
O’Brien, the vice-president of

Rainbow Alliance and sopho- ,

more majoring in Russian and
German, said the group’s mem-
bers hope that it is one more

step in the direction of a more
accepting Oakland.

But others in the community
are not happy with the idea that
Pennsylvania could follow suit in
recognizing same-sex marriage.

Lockwood, a repres_enta-
tive for the Catholic Diocese of
Pittsburgh, said that he hopes
that Pennsylvania laws stay un-
changed. '

In Lockwood’s opinion, tak-
ing down Pennsylvania’s ‘DOMA
would be “tremendously fool-
ish.”

Lockwood said he believes
that the traditional definition of
marriage is the best deﬁnition
because it meets the needs for
procreation. He understands a
family to consist of a man and
a woman who produce children
and care for those children. To
include others in whata fam-
ily is, would be detrimental to.
society as whole. ‘

“In one sense, it would have

noimpact on the Diocese what-
soever, in that how the diocese
recognizes or celebrates mar-
riage wouldn’t change,” Lock-
wood said.

Though many Americans
agree with Lockwood and re-
spect that official position of the
Catholic Diocese, recent data
shows that "a ‘small majority, of

voters are supportive of same- .

‘sex marriage rights.

According to a July Gallup 1

poll, 54 percent of polled,Ameri-
caCns,~2,o27 randomly selected
adults in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia, think that
marriages between same-sex
couples should be valid, as op-
posed to 2'7 percent of polled
Americans in 1996.
Pennsylvania Attorney Gen-

eral Kathleen Kane supports _

same-sex marriage and believes
that barring LGBT persons from
marriage is unconstitutional. In
a letter sent from Kane’s office

to Governor Tom Corbett, Kane’s
chief of staff said the act is “one
of the last discriminatory .stat-
utes.” A

In the coming months those
who are on opposite sides of
the issue may have to find a way
to reach a peaceful agreement
in regards to LGBT rights and
stigmas against them. For now,
Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance, -as well
as other campus organizations
like the LGBT Student Health
Research Center, are taking ev-
ery measure possible to be sure
that Pittsburgh is a welcoming
city and campus. ‘

“There are some lost causes,”
O’Brien said, referring to those
who oppose homosexulity.
“There are going to be people
who don’t want to listen._[But]
Pitt is just fantastic for ﬁnding
‘allies who are supportive and
want to help the cause.” I

Brett lSholtis
For The Pitt News

there is a strong connection between de-
pression and failure to adapt to college.
According to her, students who don’t ﬁnd a
niche often become stressed. This leads .to
anxiety, which in turn leads to depression.
“You’ve gone from life at home, where
things are smooth, and now you land in a
place where you don’t have a support sys-
tem, where you’re in charge of yoursel ,”
Macpherson said, referring to col_lege stu-
dents. ‘

College, with its lack of structure and its

combination of stressors, is fertile ground

for the onset of depression and other dis-
orders such as bipolar disorder and schizo-
phrenia. These disorders often ﬁrst appear
in individuals between the ages of 17 and 19.
While the consequences of these disorders
can be severe, Pitt offers services for stu-
dents suffering from them. V
According to statistics cited by" the Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health, a 2011
assessment by the American College Health
Association found that about 30 percent of
college students reported feeling “so de-
pressed that it was difﬁcult to function” at
some time in the year before the assessment.
According to Macpherson, who is the
executive director of the Pittsburgh non-
proﬁt Leading Education and Awareness for

commit suicide each year. The organiza-

tion aims to remove the stigma surround-

ing depression and to connect sufferers to
treatment resources.

ing Center at Pitt, echoes this sentiment and
also points to students’ separation from fam-
ily and friends — their old support network
-— as a factor that furthers the difﬁculty of
handling these new challenges.

“The college experience,” said Zukor,
“while new and exciting, also requires con-
necting with new people, usually living with
a roommate for the ﬁrst time, and a high
level of academic challenge.”

Psychologist Toni Macpherson said.

Depression, about 1,200 college students -

Tevya Zukor, the director of the Counsel— _

Adding to the problem, many people just _

Additional information can be found at:

Stress leaves students vulnerable
to depression during college,
campus resources available

don’t understand the disorder.

“Depression is a real and serious mental
health condition,” said Zukor. “It is also dif-
ferent from occasional periods of feeling
down.”

Unlike the passing feelings of sadness
that often accompany certain life events such
as the death of a loved one, depression is a
lingering sense of sadness, often paired with
feelings of hopelessness and inadequacy.

Zukor listed some of the additional warn-
ing signs as loss of interest in previously
enjoyable activities, increased social isola-
tion, increased irritability and lethargy or
lack of energy.

According .to Macpherson, false‘ beliefs
about depression are perhaps even more
harmful than lack of knowledge about the
disorder. Some still believe depression to be
a character ﬂaw or sign of weakness.

“In the 19605, no one ever said the word
‘cancer,’” she said. “Similarly, today, depres-
sion is still a hushed topic. This stigma is
particularly harmful because failure to treat
depression can have lifelong consequences.”

She went on to say that between the ages
18 and 25, people should establish inde-
pendence from their families and develop
‘careers. , '

-“The risks of failing to achieve adulthood
 are greater for that student who doesn’t

make it in the ﬁrst semester,” Macpherson V

said. ,
While the consequences of depression
can be serious, there are resources avail-
able to Pitt students-. The Counseling Center
offers a variety _of services, including group
counseling, individual counseling, drug and
alcohol services, sexual assault services and
even stress—free zones, where students can
learn stress—reduction and relaxation tech-
niques. -
Students‘ who think they are suffering
from depression or other problems can con-
tact the Counseling Center, which starting
_this fall will be located in the Wellness Center
on the second ﬂoor of Nordenberg Hall.
Those concerned about a fellow student are
encouraged to reach out to him or her as well
as to the appropriate residence hall adviser.

FRESHMAN 15

Students also have their opinions on the
freshman 15. Megan Bien, a sophomore major-
ing in general management, said in an email
she thinks the freshman 15 is a “myth.” Al-

though weight gain varies between between '

individuals, those who remain active and eat
healthy can avoid gaining weight.

» “Because college brought a lot of changes
into my life, I needed a constant, stress re-

. lieving activity in‘ order tosremain focused in

school,” she said. “Whether it was running
in Schenley_ [Park] or swimming laps at‘ the
pool, exercise was my way to stay mentally
and physically healthy.” I I

sins, engineered wetlands and green spaces
designed to redistribute stormwater.

I According to the PWSA’s report, those at
the sessions also recommended using parks
and other green infrastructure throughout
the city to absorb rainwater, and educating
community members. and residents about
how they can implement green infrastructure
in their homes and businesses.

Hoffman said the Clean Rivers Campaign
is impressed with the PWSA and their plan to
incorporate green infrastructure into waste
management. ‘

“We think PWSA is doing a really great
job on this,” Hoffman said, referring to their
efforts to study source reduction-

“We want to get the biggest bang for our
buck,” Melissa Rubin, a spokeswoman for
the PWSA. said. ~ c

Rubin said that she would not comment’
on details of ALCOSAN’s plan, but that both
plans will work together to accomplish the ’
same goal. A ' _

“The goal is to improve water quality by"
“eliminating overﬂow,” Rubin said. ‘

Getting Involved ,_ i

, Even some Pitt students have become
involved with the Clean Rivers Campaign,

as well as other projects. .

Several Pitt» students currently working.
for Clean Water Action are involved in the
campaign. Michelle Mancuso, a senior en-
vironmental studies major, has attended
several meetings regarding the aging sewer ‘
system; She said it’s greatto be a part of
something so important and feel like you’re
making a difference, and doesn’t think she’d.
get the same feeling if she worked at a regular
part-time job. 1

“It’s so easy to get involved with the Clean
Rivers Campaign,” Mancuso said. “I think
I’m making a difference.” ’

Hilary Marcella, who graduated from
Pitt three years ago with a degree in urban
studies, now. works as_ the assistant director
of canvassing for Clean Water Action’s Pitts-
burgh office. She began working for Clean
Water Action as a phone canvasser when she
was just a freshman. , - =- '

“There are a few reasons why it’s really
good for students,” Marcella said. “I made
more money working for Clean Water Ac-
tion than I would have as a part~tin1e worker .
somewhere else  [There’s] also really ﬂex-
ible scheduling.”

Greg Sinn, a 2008 Pitt graduate who is
now the office manager of ﬁeld canvass at.
the organization’s Pittsburgh office, said can-
vassers earn between $9.25 and $11 perlhour.

Marcella also said that by working for a
nonpartisan lobbying group like Clean Water
Action, employees develop essential com-
munication skills involving member outreach.
and fundraising. ' . _ ,

Sinn said he sees the organiiation as a
way to promote discourseon environmental
issues. ~

“Our job, really, is to bring the .comm_unity
into the conversation,” he said. I ~

Mayoral race: two candidates to square off in November election

Although City Councilman «Bill Peduto, left, is the likely winner, former state constable Joshwander, right, wants to remind Pittsburghers there is more than one party in the

After a contentious Democrat-
ic mayoral primary, nominee
and former District 8 Council-
man Bill Peduto is hoping for a
smooth path to the mayor’s of-
fice in City Hall after this fall’s
general election season, where
Pittsburgh voters will decide
their new mayor Nov. 5.

But Republican mayoral
nominee Josh Wander cer-
tainly isn’t giving in just yet.
Despite Pittsburgh’s status as
a Democratic stronghold in the
state, with the party holding
the city’s top executive posi-
tion since 1934, Wander says
it’s time to break apart the es-
tablished party_order after a
string of scandals marred the
last few years of office for out-
going mayor Luke Ravenstahl.

Bill Peduto

Having served as the District
8 councilman since 2001, Pedu-
to has pursued a number ofini—
tiatives based on the premise of
economic development within
individual East End neighbor-
hoods, including the northern-
most portions of Pitt’s campus.

Calling himselfa “reform

Democrat,” Peduto has un-
veiled a multitude ofinitiatives
as part of his campaign with
a goal of modernizing the city
government. Specifically, ac-
cording to his campaign web-

site, Peduto’s initiatives target_

“neighborhood redevelopment
and jobs,” “government reform
and innovation,” “education
and technology” and “a clean
and safe city.”

As a mayoral candidate, he
has endorsed the idea ofimpos—
ing a nonprofit tax on UPMC
and some of the city’s other
large nonprofit organizations,
though be emphasized in a de-
bate last March on Pitt’s cam-
pus that he doesn’t believe the
University should be subject to
this new nonprofit tax.

In particular, Peduto has
campaigned on the re-emer-
gence of East Liberty, a neigh-
borhood that mired in an eco-
nomic downturn but has since
experienced a dramatic revival,
highlighted by the opening of
Pittsburgh’s Google headquar-
ters in the neighborhood.

Critics of Peduto say he has

shown an unwillingness to forge
working relationships with fel-
low members of city council.
This sentiment was evident
when a number of current City
Council members, including
City‘ Council President Darlene
Harris, endorsed Peduto’s most
formidable primary opponent,
former State Auditor General
and Pittsburgh City Council
President Jack Wagner.
Additionally, Harris, who
briefly entertained the idea of
seeking the Democratic mayoral
nomination before Wagner’s en-
trance into the race, considered
running an independent cam-
paign to, oppose Peduto in the
general election, but she did not
turn in the necessary nominat-
ing petitions before the Aug. 1
deadline. -
Peduto has sought to posi-
tion himself as an outsider to
city politics after choosing to
not seek the endorsement of the
city’s Democratic Party. He says
that over the last few years, only
a strong and innovative execu-
tive can maximize Pittsburgh’s

economic resurgence.

Josh Wander

Wander, a former state con-
stable, believes he possesses the
necessary vision to maximize
Pittsburgh’s economic potential
by creating a favorable business
environment through lowering
taxes and keeping graduates of
the city’s numerous colleges in
Pittsburgh.

Wander, a dual citizen of the
United States and Israel and a
former active-duty member of
the Israeli Defense Force who
has also worked as an adviser
for Israel’s parliament, has
railed against the party‘estab-
lishment in Pittsburgh during
the early stages of his cam-
paign. I-Ie~’s an active user of
Twitter and often challenges

claims made by Peduto over the H

microblogging website.
Wander has often cited re-
cent scandals within the Raven-
stahl administration as proof
that democracy within the city
is broken and that politicians
have become unaccountable.
He often points to a recently

. uncovered incident wher_e~fo,r-I‘
mer Pittsburgh Police Chief

Nate Harper used money from
private security accounts for
personal expenses. Private or-
ganizations deposited funds

into these accounts in order to

employ Pittsburgh police offi-
cers for private security.
Unlike Peduto, Wander says
the push to impose a nonprofit
tax on UPMC is counterproduc-

tive since the company employs

about 50,000 people statewide
and because UPMC is “the one
nonprofit that happens to be
holding up the economy of our
entire region.” ,
Although he remains reso-
lute in his cause, Wander ac-
knowledges that it’s unlikely
that he’ll emerge as Pittsburgh’s
mayor after the November gen-
eral election. He said that more
than 80 percent of the city’s
residents are registered as
Democrats, and that statistics
indicate 40 percent of voters in
Allegheny County vote based on

' party_ affiliation alone. Unfazed,

he says he’s runningto remind
voters that the two,-party sys-

't:em's«till exists within the city.

Study: Twitter users may
become more passive

Lindsay Allen
Staff Wrz’ter

; ‘ Researchers, includingaPitt professor, recently

predicted that Twitter will soon lose its social
aspect in order to become a medium for more
passive entertainment.

Andrew T. Stephen, an assistant professor of
business administration at Pitt, and Olivier Tou-
bia, abusiness professor at Columbia University,
published a paper in the May andjune issue of
the journal Marketing Science in which they
argue that Twitter will soon become a medium
for more passive entertainment and advertising,
rather than a medium for interaction between
individual users. A

As part of their research, Toubia and Stephen
monitored the habits of 2,493 personal Twitter
accounts in 2009 and 2010. Some had only a
few followers, while those with the most had
more than 10,000 followers.

While still following '1Witter’s terms of use,
the researchers set up 100 fake accounts and
sent each of the owners in 100 accounts they
randomly selected a follow request from each
of their fake accounts over the ensuingso days.

During the same period, Toubia and Stephen
continued to monitor all 2,493 users’ tweeting
habits. _

Users with only a few followers and those
with thousands did not-change their tweeting
habits as dramatically as the number of their
followers increased. Users who started out
with between 13 and 26 followers increased
their tweeting dramatically. But for those with
amidrange number of followers, their tweeting
tapered off signiﬁcantly as theirfollowers grew
in number. .

p The researchers concluded that users with

relatively few followers were getting more ex-

cited with each new following and tweeting

more often. But this only lasted up to a point.
“As Twitter matures and it becomes harder

and harder to attract new followers, these users

, are likely to lose interest in posting content,”

Toubia said.

Brittany Cabot, a senior majoring in psy-
chology, said the results made sense to her be-
cause her own observations of Twitter use has

changed since she started using the site when’

whe was in high school.

Cabot said she has more than looifollowers
on the site. She said she tweets between once
and 10 timesaday. Although some of these posts
are retweets-, she often posts her own opinions
and observations.

Although some users still post personal mes-
sages, most of what appears in Cabot’s feed
comes from companies, organizations and news
services. .

“I feel like when Twitter ﬁrst started out,
people would use it to say what they were do-
ing, like ‘working on my homework,”’ she said.
“And now, it’s completely changed from that.”

Toubia and Stephen said this is a trend on
the site and might be because of the increasing

activity of commercial accounts.

Companies will often follow consumers
based on the assumption that consumers will
create content favorable to the companies, but

~ this type of use might not have the desired effect.

“[B]ased on our results, it appears that fol-
lowing consumers on Twitter may have the

' counterintuitive effect of making them less

active and, therefore, less likely to contribute
content related to the companies’ brands,” they
wrote.

As users gain more followers, they tend to
post their own tweets less often, possibly in
fear of oifendingfollowers and losing attention,
suggests the study. Because there is an innate
tendency for active users to gain followers over
time, the inevitability of a decrease in normal
users’ tweets will soon become apparent.

Since the researchers ﬁrst gathered their
data, Toubia said, the lprofessors have seen
businesses adapting in ways similar to what
they predicted .

“Over the years they have changed their po- '

sitioningfromasocial media platform designed
to let information spread across the world, to a
platform where “you don’t need to post content
to get yalue from Twitter,” Toubia said.

This switch ﬁom social to commercial media
doesn’t necessarily translate to people using
Twitter less.

“People will still use Twitter, but as a way
to get information from others as opposed to
sharing information with others. The beneﬁt
will come mostly from consumer content, not
from posting content,” said Toubia.

But Cabot said she didn’t want to see the site
completely stop being a site where individual
users posted their own content.

“Ifmy ﬁiends completelystopped tweeting,
I don’t think I’d have as much interest as I do
now,” Cabot said. I g

WASHINGTON _ Every year states hand
out more than $11’billion in ﬁnancial aid
to college students with no certainty as
to whether they’ll ever graduate.

Many states don’t track the money.
They simply hand it over and hope for the
best, as one educational consultant put it.

It’s a “one—sided partnership,” accord-
ing to Stan Jones, the president of the

States tightening rules on college loans, wanting best deals

advocacy organization Complete College
America. “The states provide the funds-,
but the expectations states have of stu-
dents are really pretty low.”

In Indiana, for instance, only around
40 percent of aid recipients willearn
their four—year degrees in even six years,
state ﬁgures show. That’s lower than the
state average for all students. And while

_ 75 percent may be certain they’re on

schedule, only halfwill end up taking the

minimum number of credits they need, A

per semester‘, to get through.

Stay up to date
on OCC rograms!

But things in the Hoosier State and
several others are about to change, as
states begin to demand something in
exchange for their investments: higher
graduation rates. »

Starting next year, Indiana students’

will be required not only to start but also
to ﬁnish 24 credits annually for their

aid to be renewed. They’ll be rewarded‘

with up to an additional $600 a year in
aid at public colleges and universities
and $1,100 more at private ones if they
complete 30 credits or more. The idea is

 
 
  

to put them on track to graduate within
four years.

“We want to make sure we’re getting
the best bang for the buck,” said Mary
Jane Michalak, .Indiana’s associate com-
missioner of student ﬁnancial aid. “Right
now our students aren?t succeeding, and
we believe this keeps them on target and
shows them how to get to the goal.”

Of course, there’s always been one
powerful incentive for students to ﬁnish
school: In most states, their eligibility for
ﬁnancial aid expires after the equivalent
of four years of study. But to a typical

college student, four years can seem very ’

distant. And when the aid dries up, the
experts say, some are forced to resort
to loans or other ways to pay, and many

, more drop out.

“It’s the difference between immedi-
ate versus distant incentives,” said Nate
Johnson, a senior consultant at HCM
Strategists, a Washington ﬁrm that states
often hire to review their education poli-
cies. .“The fact that I’m going to run ‘out
of aidin four years is a lot less pressing
than the fact that I need to pay my rent

. right now.”,

Paradoxicall-y, many state ﬁnancial-
aid programspay for a maximum of 24
credit hours annually _ 12 per semester _
which isn’t enough fora student to reach
the 120 credits typically needed to earn
a bachelor’s degree in four years. Thirty
percent of full—time students at four—year
universities_and 72 percent at community
colleges take even fewer than that and
quickly "fall behind, Complete College
America reports. V

“It’s absolutely backward,” Johnson

said.’ “We’ve created a system where we

cap (ﬁnancial aid) at 12 credits (per-se-

’ mester), and the result is students taking

a really,-really long time to graduate, if
they graduate at all.”

Early results in the few states that have
started to require that ﬁnancial-aid=re—
cipients take 15 credits a semester, or 30
per year,. show that these and other new
conditions have begun to nudge success
rates higher.

That’s'been the case in West Virginia,
where about half the students who get

_ state ﬁnancial aid now are required to

take 30 credits annually, said Brian We-
ingart, thesenior director of ﬁnancial aid
for the state’s "I-Iigher Education Policy
Commission. The proportion ofthese aid
recipients who graduate within six years
has increased to 70 percent, compared
with the average for all students in West
Virginia of lessthan 48 percent.

. “The pendulum is swinging from ac-
cess to success and getting these students
a credential, or else there isn’t_ much to
show for the money you’re investing,”
Weingart said.

Veterans face complications in applying" for in-state college tution

Kate Irby
M C T Campus

WASHINGTON -_ Some military service
members and veterans are being denied
their most well-known government ben-
eﬁt: college tuition coverage.

Ted Spencer, a Navy veteran who grew

up in Charlotte, N.C.,-continued to pay

the state income tax during his service.
But he was denied the in-state tuition
rate at North Carolina State University
because military service had taken him
to California.

The federal government covers the
cost ofthe $8,000 per year in-state rate,
but Spencer needed loans and scholar-
ships to cover the $22,000 out—of—state
tab. '

“It’s mind—blowing‘to me that North

Carolina _ a state that is known for being
extremely military friendly and home to
the largest military base in the United
States _ would be so difﬁcult when it

. comes to military veterans who want to

call this state home,f’ Spencer said.
Belen Gebremichael, the residency
director at N.C. State, said the university
has little control to which students they
grant in-state tuition, since it has to fol-
low state guidelines. Like many states,
North Carolina requires students to be
both legal residents and physically living
in the state to qualify for the in-state rate.
It means that military members could be
paying income taxes to a state the entire
time they are serving, but if they’re physi-

cally stationed in anotherstate they may
not qualify for lower tuitions.

Legislation introduced in the House
of Representatives in February by Rep.
Jeff Miller, R—Fla.,-and in the Senate in
January by Sen. John Boozman, R—Ark.,
would change that by allowing veterans
to attend any public college or university
at the in-state tuition rate starting Aug.
1, 2014. If schools would not provide the
discounted rate, they would lose federal
funds from the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, which
provides funding for service members’
tuition and fees.

“The men and women who served this
nation did not just defend the citizens of
their home states, but the cit-izens of all
50 states,” Miller said. 5‘The educational
beneﬁts they receive from the taxpayers
should reflect that.”

Some universities, however, have ex-
pressed concern over the bill’, wondering"
if its timeline is too fast and its impact
on their ﬁnances too steep.

The timeline is the biggest concern of
Lt. Gen.]oseph Weber, vice president of
student affairs at Texas A&M University

g in College Station, because most public

schools are not solely in charge of their
tuition rates. Most states would have to
pass legislation to comply with the fed-
eral law. In addition, a board may have
to approve the new tuition rates, which
would then be implemented at the uni—
versity.

Since some state legislatures, such as
Texas’, meet only every other year, it’s
likely they could miss the deadline and

be penalized, Weber said.

. “At Texas A&M, 100 percent of the
veterans would be negatively impacted
when only 3.3 percent are currently not
receiving in-state rates,” Weber said. He
advocated pushing the bill back by a year
or two to allow states to comply.

.. I Weber said-Texas A&M also has some

concerns about the ﬁnancial impact of .

the bill. While Texas A&M doesn’t have
a high out-of state veteran population,
ofﬁcials wondered about other univer-
sities that do. Hundreds or thousands

of out—of—state veterans switching to in-

state -rates would cost colleges millions
of dollars at a time most states have been
cutting education funding. _

Currently, 17 states'offer in-state tu-
ition to all veterans, regardless of where
they served; seven states offer it with
conditions, and’ 12 states are consider-
ing legislation.

Ohio was the first state to pass legisla- ’

tion, in2009. Dubbed the G.I. Promise, -it
requires public schools to offer in-state
tuition to all troops and veterans. _
The statefs largest campus, Ohio State
University in Columbus, said it hasn’t

experienced any negative_effects. Mike ,

Carrell, assistant provost and director
of the. Ofﬁce of Military and Veterans
Services at Ohio State, said class sizes
have dramatically increased since then.

“Our (veteran population) numbers
have almost tripled from thefall of 2008
to this year,” he said, saying that both
Ohio’s G.I. Promiseand the G.I. Bill have
contributed to that.

Groups such as the American Associa-
tion of State Colleges and Universities
worry that‘ the bill represents an over-
reach by the federal government, since
determining tuition rates is. something
states‘ handle. The association also thinks
the present language of the bill could have
some unintended adverse results, such
as slashing current beneﬁts to veterans.

“This bill would not allow any veteran
or their dependent enrolled at thepublic
institution to receive G.I. Bill beneﬁts if
the institution does not offer in-state tu-
ition to all veterans, thus cutting beneﬁts
to ourlveterans,” said Susan Aldridge, a
senior fellow at the Washington-based
association. ‘ - '

The Veterans of Foreign Wars,fthe

-Student Veterans of America and the

American Legion‘support the legislation.
The VFW’s Ryan Gallucci said he wants
service members to have somewhere they

can go to school at the in-state rate. He e * »

said he doesn’t think the bill should have
far—reaching consequences, since troops
are the only group who can be shut out
of in-state tuition rates because of forces
beyond their control. V

Gallucci said the common problem is
that when schools tell service members
they don’t qualify for in-state tuition,’
they just take out loans to pay the dif-
ference, instead of looking into other

- options to pay for. school.

“That’s kind of the wrong answer, be-
cause when theypassed the Post39/11 G.I.

Choice to go "Greek during college garners mixed reactions

William Hageman
M CT Campus

With the fall semester soon upon us, some T

incoming college freshmen, as well as their
parents, may be wondering whether the
student should considerjoining a fraternity
or sorority. And it’s something students in‘
high school may be thinking about as they
look ahead to their future college careers.
Is Greek life for them? What are the ad-
vantages? Are there drawbacks? I

The ﬁrst step in the process is to put _

aside any preconceived notions.

“I’d be har.d-pressed to come up with a
business, an organization, a government
agency that’s as maligned as fraternities or
sororities,” said Pat]. Bosco, vice president
for student life/dean of students at Kansas
State University. “Just look at TV, look what’s
on cable.'I can’t' come up.with one movie
that portrays Greek life in a positive way.”

There are pluses, there are minuses.

. .There are gray areas. Times have changed,

and fraternities and sororities at times seem
-to be struggling to ﬁnd their place.

“For the most part these are incredibly
dynamic organizations that serve some aw-
fully good purposes on campus _ and can
do more,” Bosco said. “What we need to
do is change the course to look toward the
academic missions of our colleges and ask:
How can we contribute to that mission,
especially student success? How can we
measure it and improve it?” ’

Here’s a look at some of the pros and
cons to weigh if considering a fraternity
or sorority:

P,-ROS ‘ - -

Networking: One of the traditional sell-
ing points for Greek life is the connections
one can make, not justfwith current chapter
members, but with the network of former
fraternity or sorority members in the busi-
ness world. A fraternity is not a four-year
college experience, like a school club; it’s a

‘ lifetime involvement.

. “I have seen the beneﬁts of that for some
students who look to their fraternity or
sorority upon graduation when they’re look-
ing for a job,” said Katherine Cohen, the

CEO and founder of IvyWise, an educational
consulting company that helps students
gain admission to everything from pre-
kindergarten to graduate school. _

Of course, in 2013 there‘ are myriad

other ways to build your network. Cohen ,

also pointed out that a university offers
many other opportunities to meet people
in small group settings, “whether it’s join-

ing the newspaper or a dance company or,

an a cappella group. If (a student has) other
interests, I encourage you to look at all the
opportunities to ﬁnd students on campus
with common interests.”

Housing: Fraternity housing is generally
less expensive than living in a residence
hall. “If you check out most websites of

Greek affairs offices on college campuses, ‘

th_ey’re very straightforward on pricing and
ﬁnancial expectations,” Bosco said. And the
fraternity or sorority house experience also
exposes a student to more real-life situa-
tions _ the house must be maintained, bills
paid, a cook hired, etc. 1

I Cohen» said the cost depends on the fra-
ternity or sorority and the year the student

is in. She said sharing an off-c-ampus apart-
ment may be cheaper than living in a dorm.
And living in a fraternity can be more cost
effective _ but you have to do the homework.
“Speak to someone in the frat. What are the
real costs? Have them lay them out. Find out
if they’ll be saving or not.”

Charitable work; Through various fun-
draisers, fraternities and sororities raise
money for national and local charities, as

- well as individual causes. (Earlier this year,

members of Phi Alpha Tau at Emerson Col-
lege in Boston raised more than $20,000
to help pay for a transgendered chapter
member’s female—to—male surgery.) Accord-
ing to the North-American Interfraternity
Conference, a trade association for 75 inter-
national and national men’s fraternities, the i
groups raised $21.1 million for charity in the
2011-2012 school year (nicindy.org/press).
Better numbers: Bosco said that students
belonging to fraternities and sororities gen-

erally have higher grade—point averages than '

the rest of the student body (though other

LOANS

Early results from similar pilot pro-
grams in Louisiana, Ohio and New Mex-
ico show that connecting financial aid
with meeting certain benchmarks has
increased the number of credits earned
and the proportion of students who stay
in school.

Higher grades also resulted in Loui-
siana, where the aid was tied, in part, to
academic performance. Tennessee gives
preference for financial aid to recipients
who return from_one year to the next.

_ California, Arizona and Florida are test-

~ ing ideas like these. ,

_In Indiana, more than two—thirds of
financial—aid recipients say they’ll take
30 credits per year once it’s a-condition
of getting the money.

“We shouldn’t view financial aid
simply as an entitlement,” said Richard
Freeland, the commissioner of higher
education in Massachusetts, which is try-
ing the idea of giving some state grant
recipients more money the more courses
they take, up to an additional $2,000 a
year. “I believe that it is reasonable to
think of financial aid to some degree as
a social contract between the state and
the student. The state is saying we are
investing in you because not only is it
important to you, but it is important to
the state.”

Graduating on time not only produces
more degree holders in states that are

H struggling to find qualiﬁed employees for

' high—skilljobs, but it also saves students

money. Indiana estimates that each ad-

_ ditional year in school costs a student

$50,000 in lost wages and additional
tuition and fees for which financial aid
typically has run out.

There have been similar proposals to,

tie federal financial aid to graduation
rates by forgiving federal student loans
for low-income students who graduate
within four years, rewarding students
with larger grant amounts for taking at
least 30 credits per year and requiring

students who drop out to pay back the‘

government for any grant money they
received. '

Nationally, less than 58 percent of stu-
dents at four-year universities-and col-

leges graduate within“six years, and 14.3
percent at two~year colleges within three,
according to Complete College America.

Two-thirds of voters whom Hart Re-
search Associates surveyed last fall for
HCM Strategists said the highest priority
for overhauling the f1nancial—aid system
should be to increase the number of re-
cipients who graduate.

Some critics worry that pushing-stu-
dents this way might make things worse,
not better. They say that students who
already are struggling in school might
fail if they’re forced to take more credits,
or might switch to the easiest possible
majors. At many public universities and

colleges, which have suffered years of I

budget cuts, required courses may be full
or unavailable when students need them.

“You want them to finish, but there’s
also something to be said for having them
learn something,” said Rodney Andrews,
an assistant economics professor at the
University of Texas at Dallas who has
studied state ﬁnancial-aid programs.

The federal Advisory Committee on
Student Financial Assistance said last
month that attachingstrings to ﬁnancial
aid in order to increase graduation rates
is “likely to further undermine the four-
year college enrollment, persistence and
completion ofqua1if1edlow—income high
school graduates, particularly minority
students.” . '

But two states, California and C010-
rado, are doing exactly that: using their
financial aid money to make institutions
graduate more students.

In_ California, students no longercan
use state financial aid to go to universi-
ties or colleges that have low graduation
and high student—loan default rates. In
Colorado, campuses will get more state
financial—aid money for students who stay
on track to finish their degrees. Colorado
also is considering adding a stick to that
carrot: cutting ﬁnancial-aid allocations to

"campuses that take too long to graduate

their lowest-income students.

“There’s gotta be accountability,” said
Darryl Greer, who focuses on higher edu-
cation at the William]. Hughes Center for
Public Policy at Stockton College of New
Jersey. “And who should we hold account-
able? The institutions.” I

Bill the goal was to provide a free in—state
education at the public school of their
choice,” he said. “We want them to go
somewhere at the in—state rate.”

More than 800,000 veterans'beneﬁt—
ed from goverriment education funding in

2010, and the federal government spent ‘

just under $4.5 billion on veterans in
2009 for education-related expenditures,

according to the Department of Veterans ‘
_ Affairs.

There are other possible ﬁxes pend-
ing in Congress, such as putting the pri-
vate school cap on public schools as well.
Service members can get up to $18,000
per year for private school coverage, but
public schools are capped at their in—state.
rate. Schools concerned about switching
to in—state tuition for all veterans were
more supportive of that idea, but veterans
interest groups were not.

Different versions of the bill have been
introduced in the House and the Senate;

the House version already has 50 bipar— ,

tisan co-sponsors. I '

factors may contribute). They. also have
higher freshman and sophomore retention
rates and more service hours, Bosco ‘noted.

CONS

Financial, time commitments: Both can
be substantial. Cohen pointed out the Greek
life involves many social engagements that
need to be balanced with the class work-
load. Then there’s the ﬁnancial commit-
ment. “There are dues, functions, events,”
she said. “We’ve seen a lot of hidden costs
families might not have thought of before
the rush process.”

Just as if you were buying a car, get all the

be upfront. Don’t be afraid to ask; ‘What

can’t or won’t answer, look elsewhere.”

As for the time commitment, Bosco sug-
gested that incoming freshmen decrease

a freshman typically carries 15 hours, go
with 12. There are too many fraternity-
related commitments that can interfere

with studies. .

Hazing: A fraternity couldpraise tens
of thousands of dollars to buy puppies for
needy children, but one hazing incident

halfway across the country is what makes

headlines and what people remember. Haz-
ing is universally deplored by fraternity and
sorority officials (and it should be pointed
out that it occurs in other non—Greek orga-
nizations, such as athletic teams and bands,
as well). Still, it does happen. According
to a recent report by Bloomberg News, 59
students died in incidents involving frater-
nities since 2005, 10 of them in 2012 alone.

“I am on record as adamant that hazing
has no place in the fraternity or sorority
experience and should be reported im-

9 a.m. -—- 6 pm. i

mediately,” Smithhisler said. “Go in with
the expectation, fl will not be hazed.’ They
should ask the fraternity or sorority that
question speciﬁcally. I joined the chapter
I belonged to 30 years ago and asked that
” question, and they kept their word.”
“There isn’t a national organization or
local group that doesn’t have a zero toler-
ance policy when it comes to hazing,” Bos-
co added. “National leaders, local chapter
members are doing everything they can to
eliminate all aspects of hazing. My rule is, if
you think it’s hazing, it’s hazing. Instances
when they occur have to be dealt with in
a no-tolerance manner and be dealt with
quickly.”
Party time: “Animal House” was an exag-
' geration, but there was a nugget of truth. A
2002 study -by the Higher Education Cen-
ter for Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention
found that fraternities and sororities were

among the groups that fostered a culture of ’

drinking on college campuses.

One way to check an organization’s com-
mitment to studies is to look at a fraternity
or sorority’s website and ﬁnd the last three
years of records of their grades. Bosco also
suggestedlthat. parents visit chapter houses
and ask about the commitment to student
success. “Qutstanding chapters recruiting
young men involve parents along the way.
I would look for that,” he said.

They may not want you: Wanting to be
part of Greek life doesn’t necessarily mean
you can. You_still have to be accepted, and
not everyone is.

Challenges: Bosco says that fraternities
and sororities need to work harder in sever-
al areas, such as focusing on their successes
and connecting better with the academic
side of the university. '

“They’re combating an awful lot of mis-
conceptions and their brand is blurred,” he
said. “The bestway for them to look to the
future is to partner with academic missions
that are strategic and will make sense to a lot
of stakeholders _ faculty, boards of trustees,
prospective students, family members. They
have to get serious about their contributions
to students’ success. Speciﬁcally, freshman
and sophomore retention rates, graduation
rates, and if they’re going to bebragging

' about networking, let’s quantify that with
(numbers about) jobs and internships for
members.”

BOTTOM LINE
Smithhisler says the vastmajority _ofstu-
dents seeking membership are what he calls
“maybe joiners.” They’re not sure if Greek
life is for them. He would advise them to
“enter into the recruitment experiencewith
some good questions: Will I be valued‘? Will
my personal experiences contribute" to the
overall success of this group? Will I have
an opportunity to practice my leadership,
perhaps have some fun‘? Will this comple-
ment my academic goals?
“What usually happens is they’ll ﬁnd
their place -or they decide to go‘ in a differ-'
: ent direction in college. Both answers are
just ﬁne. There shouldn’t be any pressure
to do it.”-I

Medical school bars unlawful residents

Lorent Turnbull
M CT Campus

SEATTLE _ More than anything else, Si-
mon Mendoza wants to be ‘a doctor.

He was 13 when the idea morphed from
childhood ambition into a real goal _ after

his father suffered a workplace accident, and —

Mendoza as his interpreter accompanied
him to appointments and helped direct his
physical therapy.

At 16, he obtained a certiﬁed nursing
assistant license and, volunteering with the
Red Cross, traveled to Louisiana to help pro-
vide medical care after Hurricane Gustav
in 2008. 1

And just before he graduated with a bach-
elor’s degree in microbiology from the Uni-
versity of Washington last year, Mendoza
started a free clinic to help deliver basic
health care to those living in rural areas of
the state _ including the little town of Royal
City, Wash., where he grew up.

But for all he’s done to prepare, medi— '

cal school remains only a distant hope for
the 22-year-old Mendoza, whose parents
brought him to the U.S. illegally from Mexico
when he was less than a year old.
The University of Washington School of
Medicine, which he wants to attend, does
not admit people who are in the country
unlawfully _ a policy that exists at all but
one of the nation’s medical schools.
“If someone asked me to pick the one
person I’d like to see admitted (to medi-
cal school), he would be my choice,” said
Jaime Lara, a microbiology professor who
retired in 2011 after nearly 40 years at the
university, many of them on the admissions
committee of the medical school.
“He’ll make an excellent physician one
day.” '
For undergraduate and all other gradu-
ate programs, the school not only accepts
undocumented immigrants, but under state
law also grants them in-state tuition.
In fact, its School of Medicine, like many
other medical schools, accepts no interna-

tional students at all and only a limited num-.

ber from outside its service region, which
includes Washington, Montana, Alaska,
Idaho and Wyoming.

With a limited number of available slots,
medical schools say they must focus on can-
didates who in the end can actually work
_ and complete a residency and practice
medicine. . '

This year, for example, about 4 percent

‘of the more than 6,000 people who applied
to the University of Washington’s medical
school were accepted. In an email, the school
said its policy‘ is “historical and based on
graduating doctors who are most likely to

meet the health—care needs of the region.” .

For a while, Mendoza had pinned his
hopes on a green—card petition his father’s
brother ﬁled for him, his siblings and his
parents when they allﬁrst arrived in the

U.S. about 20 years ago.

But a huge backlog of green-card appli-
cations means a long wait for those from
countries such as Mexico, China and India.
When he turned 22 this month, Mendoza,
the youngest of the-children withoutlegal

immigration status, became too old to‘ be:

considered part of the family application _
just as green cards were becoming available
for them. ‘

His voice broke as he talked about this
crushing turn of events, and said he hopes
immigration authorities might consider his
circumstances as they consider his parents’
case. 4

“My whole life all I’ve tried to do is help
people,” said Mendoza, who works as a care-
giver for a retired doctor. “I’ve always been
one to never lose hope, always looking for
the loophole. At this point a miracle has to
happen.”

An announcement lastyear by the Stritch

School of Medicine at Loyola University of-

fers some hope. »

The privatejesuit school in Chicago has
begun accepting applications from certain
undocumented young people _* those eli-
gible for a kind of quasi-legal status called
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
(DACA). Those individuals are eligible for
Social Security numbers and work permits.

Mark Kuczewski, director of the Neis—
wanger Institute for Bioethics at Loyola, said
the school has been ﬂooded withfinquiries
since its policy went into effect, and he es-
timates that up to a dozen DACA applicants
will be accepted this year.

At a time when the nation is growing
more diverse _ with Latinos leading the way
_ medical schools cannot continue -turning
away promising, talented young people,
Kuczewski said.

‘ “We are glad to be the ﬁrst, but we don’t
want to be the last,” he said.

Other medical schools are reviewing their
admissions policies in light of DACA. The
University of Washington is not one of them.

DACA status isn’t a permanent ﬁx for
those in the country illegally. Created
through executive order by the Obama ad-

. ministration, it’s renewable after two years

but could be nixed by a future administra-

tion. ” -
Kuczewski said admissions officials at

Stritch decided not to worry about that:

' “They are eligible today, and we’ll allow them

to compete on a level playing ﬁeld,” he said.

Geoffrey Young, senior director of stu-
dent affairs and programs with the Asso-
ciation of American Medical Colleges said
medical schools are becoming increasingly
aware of DACA.

“They are beginning to look at what their
policies are in conjunction with state law and
ultimately whether students under DACA
will be able to complete his or her training,”

- Young said.

Mendoza’s parents initially settled in
Kent after arriving in Washington in the

1990s; both eventually found work on a
dairy farm in Eastern Washington.

After his father’s hand was crushed in
a workplace accident, Mendoza said the
family returned to Kent, where he graduated

_ from Kentlake High School.

Unable to afford tuition at the University

- of Washington at that time, he earned an

associate degree from Green River.Com—
munity College and was accepted to the state
university in 2010. He said he worked at
least 30 hours a week throughout college,
while also taking jobsand volunteering at
hospitals and nursing homes to gain training
and experience.

Last year, he created a nonproﬁt organi-
zation called Rural Health Education, coax-
ing funds from various groups, including
private donors to help pay for it.

He and several other students along with
nurses offer free cholesterol and blood-pres-
sure tests and other services, in rural parts
of Eastern Washington. . _

Mendoza, who wants to be a primary-
care physician, said he applied only to the
University of Washington because the in-
state tuition there was all his family could
afford. Being able to live at home while he at-
tends medical school would also save money.

If he’s unable to attend medical school
(he’s now considering applying to Loyola),

he might apply to a physician-assistant pro-

gram at Washington.
Though far from ideal, he said, “That
could well be the closest I’ll get to my dream.”

GELS

Ryan Hayward, an associate profes- '
s_or of polymer science and engineer-
ing at the_University of Massachusetts '
Amherst agreed that the hydrogels in
Kuksenok’-s and Balazs’ model could be ’
usefulin medical procedures, among
other possible uses. -

Along with microfluidics, gels could
be used as scaffolds in regenerative.
medicine and tissue engineering. The
Pitt researchers’ model suggests that
hydrogels containing spirobenzopyran
chromophores could serve this‘ pur-
pose better, since medical professionals
could use light to change the shape and
direction of the tissue as it grew.

“Certainly, there’s a lot of interest in
seeing how we can mold the growth and
shape of cells and tissue,” Hayward said.

Hayward, who has collaborated with
Balazs on previous research projects,
said he is interested in verifying the
Pitt researchers’ simulated model ex-
perimentally. — _ - - .

“The ability to really reprogram at
will the pattern of growth or contrac-

tion [of the gels] is wl1'at’s attractive to p ‘

me,” he said.

COLCUMN

Simon Brown
Columnist

Eighteen years ago, much of the incoming
freshman class had not yet been born, Pitt
Stadium still dominated the landscape
of “Cardiac Hill” and the University’s

endowment couldn’t claim halfa billion " 

dollars.

The University, which now welcomes
those incoming freshmen, has noticeably
matured right alongside them. And no
conversation of this brochure-worthy
development at Pitt over the past two
decades ever strays far from one name:
Mark Nordenberg.

Every common metric for quantifying
University progress speaks to the suc-
cess of Nordenberg’s career: a sextupling
endowment, a 20-percent increase in
the number of applications received and
a place among the five most federally
funded universities. All of these achieve-
ments — not to mention the residence hall
named after him — testify on behalf of
his stunning career, which is set to end
in August 2014. . «

Butthe rapid ascent of this institution
and its chancellor underscores a maxim
that the Board of Trustees ought to con-
sider when selecting his replacement: A
senior administrator alone can steer a
college eitherto success or failure.

        
     
   
  
 
    

Alright, this might seem redundant consider-
_ -. ing this is the ‘‘welcome Back Edition,” but,
1?; welcome back, Pitt News readers. I hope you’re
7’ all prepared for what should be another ex-
citing and eventful year at the University of
Pittsburgh.
If you’ve read through the newspaper up
to this point, you’re probably pretty surprised

by the size of this edition. One hundred and
forty—eight pages are a lot to ﬁll, without a
doubt. But let me be clear: We needed every
one of those pages. You see, every year there
are a number of storylines to followas classes
begin,.and we feel that its our responsibility
at The Pitt News to provide our readers with
a guide to this ever—changing community in

    OPINIONS

New chancellor must lead by diplomacy, not decree

 

Chancellor Nordenberg has set an example for how the next chancellor must lead.

This lesson has taken on a distinct
urgency in the past few years. University
presidents and chancellors across the
nation are joining Nordenberg in his en-
trance to partial retirement, asthe aver-
age age of senior administrators climbed
to 61 in 2011.

The imminent withdrawal of a sea-
soned generation of administrators
leaves fresh faces to inherit a position

that could prove to be one of the toughest in
the history of college basketball? These story-

lines, and several others, should provide some I
excitement — or dismay — for even casual '

fans of Pitt sports. . '

You also can’t forget about the upcoming
Student Government Board elections, inwhich
the Pitt student body decides who it feels best_
represents its interests. Another news item
that might be of interest is the Pennsy_lvania’s
Defense ofMarriage Act law, whichis currently
under review in the state Supreme Court. The
Pitt News will keep you updated on develop-
ments in local and national elections and cases.

You might also be interested in our Arts
and Entertainment section, inwhich our editor
and his staff track the latest trends, up—and-
coming bands and styles, so you and future
Pitt students can get an understanding of the
constantly changing culture surrounding life
on a college campus.

Our coverage of these storylines, however,
doesn’t end inthis edition. Read The Pitt News
throughout the school year in order to keep up
with the latest news on campus and around the

Balancing act: learning, your

limits  college

Ellie Petrosky
Assiszfcmt Opinions Editor

During your-time in college, you learn
more than the skills of your major and
the information that your classes teach
you. In fact, perhaps the most important
learning you accomplish occurs outside
the classroom. q '

College is about finding where your
limits lie. You learn how many hours of
studying for ﬁnals results in a mental
breakdown. You learn how much time
you" can spend around yourfriends before
they begin to drive you crazy. But most
importantly, after you learn your limits,
you learn how to push them as well.

The following are five different areas
through which you can learn your limits,
as well as a few ideas about how to push
them a little further this year.

‘ 1. Sharing time between a part‘-tim
job and school '

g This is a limit I had to discover rela-
tively quickly upon starting school. Mak-
ing sure you leave

3. Balancing class and partying

Your parents might have harped on
and on about this before you left for
school, and even though you might
have ignored them, it is a valid point to
consider. Going out and meeting new
people is part of the college experience,
but classes become increasingly difficult
when you‘ are nursing a hangover the next
day. There’s nothing wrong with going
out during the week, but knowing your
fun limit on a weeknight iskey. If your
thirsty Thursdays are followed by blaz-
ing headaches in chemistry class the next
day, reconsider partying the night before

class. Your grades will thank you.

4. Homesickness

If being away from home for long pe-
riods of time puts knots in your stomach
and tears in your eyes, you’re not alone.
If you’re from a close—knit family, being
away from your loved ones is always dif-
ficult. However, if you-’re lucky enough
to live close to home, you probably re-
turn more often than you stay at school.
Instead of going

hours you can work
during the week, and make sure he un-
derstands that you do have classwork on
top of your job. If you find yourself with
more down time than you anticipated,
thinkabout adding a few more hours to
your work schedule. Even if this proves
difficult, nobody can argue with having
a little bit imorespending money.

2. Course load

As a freshman, you might have figured
out that the number of classes you ini-
tially signed up for was too many or too
few, and it might have taken a semester
or two before you decided what the per-
fect course load is. But if you’ve taken
the same number of credits, or settled
for the bare minimum of twelve, maybe
it’s time to add a class or two. This idea

andrit also has the potential to surprise

as difficult as you think!

has the added bonus of enabling you to i

you: Taking 15 or 18 credits might not be I

. minimum effort.

A . By now you prob-

ably know that college is a whole different
ballgame. By the time your first ﬁnals
week rolled around, you quickly discov-
ered how much studying you could do at
once before the words on the page started

_ running together or your head began to

pound. If you’re like-me, you realized that
sitting still for a long period of time isn’t
possible. This year, try pushing yourself
to keep your nose in your book longer, or
write one more page of that paper before
turning in. You might surprise yourself
with how much more you get done in a
short period of time.

>This..schoo’l year is a brand new op-
portunity to discover where you limits
lie, both in the areas I mentioned and
ones I haven’t. No matter your goals for
the year, test yourself. Learn your limits.
But, most of all, push them. You never
know what you’re capable of until you
exceed what you thought was possible. I

BROWN

But the rise of research facilities, stu-
dent affairs and the NCAA at the turn of
the century combined, further complicat-

ing the role of,a college president. Ever.

since, university presidents have looked
increasingly to a different role model for
leadership — the definitive administrator
of the past century — the CEO.

This shift in the leadership culture of
higher education has produced its fair
share of controversy. To find an example
of a campus seriously divided on this
issue, one needs to look no further than
New-York University this past March. At

August 20, 2018 l The Pitt News l vvvwv.pittnevvs.com

the largest private college in the country,
the faculty from four different schools
voted overwhelmingly that they held “no
confidence” in the polarizing president
of the university, John Sexton. 
Sexton’s career would look undeniably
stellar to any numbers-minded Board of
Trustees. He succeeded in expanding the
campus through a considerable construc-
tion project, establislied international
campuses from Abu—Dhabi, United Arab
Emirates, to Buenos Aires, Argentina,
and attracted world—class faculty to NYU.
But none of these strides came without a
snag. Faculty opposed the demolition of
a significant part of their neighborhood,
the construction of campuses in countries

without academic freedom and the unfair
pay scale for all-star scholars.

Most of all, however, they objected
to Sexton’s authoritarian approach to
each decision, which disregarded faculty
perspectives until after the fact.

Though the trustees rallied around
their president, the‘ faculty could not
adjust to the hierarchical leadership
structure that Sexton attempted to foist
upon them. After a fewno confidence
votes, the internal fault lines under the
university’s mission began to surface.

Ultimately, this story provides a cau-
tionary tale to the search committee ap-
pointed by Pitt’s trustees to determine
the next chancellor. While efficiency and

decisiveness might represent the hall-
marks of an executive corporate office,
they have no place in the halls of higher
education. '

And even if the national conversation
excludes it, the reason is obvious: Univer-
sities are not proﬁt—making businesses.
At least, the ones that receive accolades
aren’t.

The chief executive for a business pur-
sues — for better or for worse — one out-
come: increased proﬁt. And what makes

things even simpler is the ease with which i

one can quantify that outcome. Since
the purpose of any business is rarelya
dispute, the “efﬁciency” with which a
leader can pursue objectives becomes the
measure for success. Luckily, nothing in
higher education is so simple, regardless
of how hard the U.S. News 8; World Report
might try to make it seem.

What a university provides — ideally,
education — is a far more complicated

‘concept than profit. It means.different

things to different communities within
the college. Whether it is job training or

service learning or intellectual curiosity,’
faculty, students and state governments

all have different deﬁnitions of a proper
education:

It is the role of the chancellor, then,
to balance these perspectives and deliver
an education worthy of each. When he
subordinates several to the wishes of only
one, he can dismantle the sophisticated
relationship of the university community.

While NYU learned this lesson the
hard way, Pitt doesn’t have to. V

When the search committee consid-

ers its applicants, it should remember '

that its ideal candidate is not someone
who can make snap decisions and raise
endowments. Instead, he or she must do
what academics do best: talk. I

Anyone who has sought a support net-
work to help recover from a traumatic
experience knows that the Internet houses
plenty of communities ready to embrace a
stranger in need. Now, joining the ranks of
recovering addicts and recent divorcees in
these cyber communities is a rather unex-
pected group: graduate students preparing
their dissertations.

Comments dot the Grad-School Life
section of the Chronicle of Higher Educa-

tion’s online forum as well as like-minded

communities such as the aptly titled Phin-
ishD. .

“Folks on this forum —— do you ever
daydream about graduation? I looked up
grad procedures the other day, and I was
almost drooling I was so anxious. I know
it’s far away, but one has to have hope.”

These testimonials all spring from a
common neurosis about an ever-expand-
ing time commitment to prepare» for less
and less certain job prospects, which af-
fects graduate students of all universities
and disciplines. -

This anxiety surrounding the disserta-

tion in particular — and graduate educa-

Guided teachings

August 20, 2018 [The Pitt News 1- vvvwv.pittrtevvs.com

tion in general — certainly has its reasons.
In humanities departments, the average
graduate student spends 9 1/2 years work-
ing toward a Ph.D. — and that’s if they have
the grit to finish the task. They would be
in the 49-percent minority of humanities
students who can claim a doctoral degree
after 10 years compared to the less-than-
encouraging 57 percent of students across
the disciplines who can do the same.
What’s more, even those few students
who finish the Ph.D. confront an academic
job market composed mostly of temporary,
nontenured lecturer or adjunct professor
positions. And the. many‘ who can’t land
even these low-level teaching positions
ﬁnd few employers interested in hiring an
“overqualiﬁed” Ph.D. for a nonacademic
job. . i ‘
All of these obstacles staring down
prospective scholars could shrink if only
university departments would re-evaluate
the perpetual headache of graduate stu-
dents otherwise known as the dissertation.
The purpose behind requiring the dis-
sertation as an entrance to academia seems
obvious enough. The expression of new
knowledge and novel perspectives remains
an important responsibility of any schol-

arly career, and rightfully so.

But one would hope that a prospec-
tive historian could articulate a well—re-
searched viewpoint in under 300 pages
— the average length of a history dis-
sertation, according to the University of
Minnesota’s online thesis and dissertation
archive. Though historians do write the
longest dissertations, the average 100-
page biostatistics dissertation at the other
end of the length spectrum could still ex-
haust even the most committed readers.

.The expanding length of the disserta-
tion accompanies the equally frustrating
“publish and perish” syndrome gripping
scientiﬁc and humanistic departments.

As academic jobs become more com-
petitive, researchers feel the pressure to

publish papers and books at breakneck»

speed to stay attractive to potential grant
and tenure committees’. For an anxious
grad student looking to get his foot in the
academic door, it only makes sense to pub-
lish as fat a dissertation as possible or else
get lost on the ever—widening bookshelf.
But despite the high dropout rates from

‘Ph.D. programs,_academic departments

are reluctant to reform anything. Why
would they adjust a system that provides

houl  focus ofPh.D.   programs  

a steady supply of cheap teachers‘? It has

become standard practice for graduate
students to finance their education by
teaching the recitations andlintroductory

classes. that tenured faculty prefer to avoid._

Hopefully, these graduate students
don’t realize the tragic irony that their
teaching is partially responsible for the

. limited market for tenured faculty, which

they will encounter themselves in a few

_ years — that is, if they manage to finish

their dissertations.

Expecting graduate students to teach
classes does not have to be part of the
problem, though. On the contrary, it is
the best solution. It just has to be done
correctly. ‘ A

Bymaking guided teaching experience
the cornerstone of graduate education,
departments could address the problems
complicating the route to the Ph.D. It could
shorten the needlessly long time commit-
ment toward the doctorate by providing
a metric besides dissertation length to
measure the strength of a Ph.D. candidate.

In addition, by standardizing the teach-
ing preparation and experience required

To privatize, or.

To Privatize or not to Privatize: Pennsylva-
nia’s Dilemma

Nothing is more reminiscent of summer
than the smell of barbeque while opening
a cold beer with your friends. But Pennsyl-
vania’s alcohol laws can make the price for
beer painful, and locating it a difficult task.

As an out-of—stater in Pennsylvania, it
often feels like I’m stepping back into the
Prohibition era of “The Great Gatsby” every
time I try to buy a six-pack.

In a time where states are legalizing mari-
juana for recreational use, Pennsylvania is
still struggling to catch up with the majority
of the country and reform its archaic alcohol
laws. Out of the 18 states that still regulate
alcoholic beverages — collectively known
as Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) states
— Pennsylvania has arguably the strictest
regulations. With the state running all liquor
stores and regulating the licensing of malt
beverage distributors, essentially any drink
containing a molecule of alcohol is somehow
controlled by the state.

The strictness of these alcohol laws have
caused many of the state's residents to look
at the‘?’ease of alcoholic beverage ‘sales in
other states with envy and, within the past
decade, the state has attempted to imple-
ment some ‘creative ideas to appease its
residents while still maintaining control.

Anyone who had the misfortune of using
— or more likely attempting to use — one
of the wine kiosks set up in grocery stores
several years ago can tell you that this state
can come up with some interesting ways to
throw away money. _

Proposed in 2009 and putting the state -

over $1 million in debt, several stores such
as Wegman’s voluntarily dropped these mal-

’ functioning kiosks because they were so dif-

ﬁcult to use. Issues with the kiosks, including
requiring customers to use a breathalyzer
and, at times, failing to deposit wine after
taking customers’ money, caused the experi-
ment to come to an end in 2011. '

This kiosk incident increased criticism _

of those who still support state control, who
argue that the continuation of state regula-
tion will help bridge Pennsylvania’s debt.

. They argue that sales taxes on alcohol will

generate enough money to pay off the debt,
and state control is wasting more money
than it’s creating. Looking at the money
squandered by the kiosk system, it seems
the latter group is right. .

Against the wishes of many of the union-

ized liquor store employees, officials are re-
alizing that their constituents are fed up and
looking at privatization lustfully. It is clear
that Pennsylvania’s alcohol laws were set
up with a post-Prohibition mindset and are
designed to make the purchase of alcohol as

’ difficult as possible. Many companies, such '

an

to not privatize: 'Pa’s dilemma   r  

Pa. Gov.Tom Corbett would be wise to sign the liquor privatization bill into law.

MCT Campus. . j
as Sheetz , have rallied customer support for
a bill that would privatize alcohol sales in the
state. The bill has already passed the state
House of Representatives and is poised to
pass in the Senate-in the fall.

Earlier this summer, when it became ap-

V parent that the privatization movement was

gaining momentum, alcohol distributors
began scramblingfor solutions to prevent
the":bill"from‘passing. ‘ ll * 

In May, several beer distributors re-
quested that they be able to sell six—packs,
rather than the larger 24-beer cases they
carry exclusively. In addition, bar owners
were seeking the ability to sell larger cases,

rather than the 12-packs or smaller contain- _
‘ers or single bottles they are restricted to.

The proposal made sense, as there was no
reason to have two locations selling the-same

Rethinking extracurricular
activities could help foster
economic mobility

Natalie Russell
For The Pitt News

‘For as long as I can remember, or, at least,

for as long as I’ve been in school, free
time Has been something I’ve associated
with guilt and anxiety. It’s that creeping

‘capitalist mentality that incessantly nags
at me to do something productive with all _

of my waking hours.

In a social system that values submis-
siveness to institutions and loathes in-
dependence, not having extracurricular
activities consume your every waking
moment is frowned upon.

It’s part of the way the system is rigged:
The rich kids whose parents can afford
the best private schools and the most
prestigious extracurricular programs are
rewarded with Ivy League educations that
put them on a moving platform to Con-
gress, the Fortune 500 list or both.

It’s no secret that the U.S. has one
of the worst rates of class mobility in
the developed world. Extracurriculars
are just one more way lower economic

classes are disadvantaged and kept from

ever American Dreamingtheir way -to the
upper echelons. ~

Extracurriculars claim to foster “well-
roundedness” in students, but the ques-
tion remains as to whether or not dulling
the sharp edges of independent students
is worth the loss of individualism.

It’s worth it in the sense that it molds
students to fit in with structured institu-
tions, such as colleges and corporations,
but it doesn’t do anything to encourage
creativity and critical thinking, no mat-
ter how many painting classes and drama
performances you’ve got under your belt.

Yet, that’s always how extracurricular
activities seem to be advertised: outlets
for students to expand their minds and
gajnilivercp mrppripnr-9

I always received panicky looks from
guidance counselors and admissions of-
ﬁcers in high school, and now in college,
when they notice line after empty line,
denoting my lack of extracurriculars.
‘They distrust me. ,

You’re treated as a liability when you
don’t submit yourself to militar_istic, ear-
ly-morning tennis drills or at least some
kind of obscure foreign ﬁlm club. This is

.l ‘ probably because you haven’t proven to

be very well—disciplined. '

I can almost hear their minds reeling
about what I might be doing with all of
that unrecorded free time. Shouldn’t I
know better than to occupy my free time
independently and without the supervi-

sion of authority ﬁgures?

My own social anxiety and interest
in transcendental meditation haven’t
exactly worked in my favor, but neither
have economics.

According to David Brooks ofthe New
York Times, upper-income parents have
increased the amount they spend on their
childrens’ enrichment activities — tutor-
ing and extracurriculars — by $5,300 per
year over the last 40 years. Meanwhile,
parents in lower classes (excluding the
ever—elusiVe middle class) have only in-

creased their investment by $480, even ,

with adjustment for inﬂation. .
What’s more, affluent kids are nearly
twice as likely to play after—school sports

- and are significantly more likely to par-
ticipate in non-sporting activities such as

theater, yearbook and scouting. T

For anyone with a lower-class back-
ground, these statistics are dishearten-
ing, but not altogether shocking. After
all, extracurricular activities come with
the financial burdens of equipment costs,-
membership fees, transportation hurdles
and time spent away from the after-school
minimum-wage job necessary to helping
the family make ends meet. -

It’s either dismissed as a borderline
conspiracy or so obvious it’s almost
not worth mentioning, but either way,
no one likes to hear that they’re being
trained for conformity. Or worse, that
their independence is predetermined by
their parents’ income, and conformity is
something they should strive for but not
actually have.

The need to socially adapt for the
greater good of the whole social institu-
tion is almost innate. It’s an evolutionary
truism, really. A .

But" what happens when lower-class
members of society are ostracized into

their own separate corners of individu- -

:ali:m‘7 hm:-Q it than hprnmp :4 qnecfign
of who canout-weird everyone else to
become the fewtruly individualistic peo-
ple accepted in a more orless uniform
society?

The overwhelming influence of class
makes individualism not a choice for the
lower class, but a necessary means of
survival.

Extracurriculars are just one aspect of
the education system thatneeds rethink-
ing so they may actually foster-creativity
and provide accessibility for lower-class
students —— at least, if we ever want eco-
nomic mobility to evolve to the American
Dream we advertise. I

for the doctorate, recent Ph.D.s could ap-

with credentials that a universally attests

paid tenured faculty. Rather than thrust:
ing second—year doctoral, students into
a recitation or a 200-person lecture as
“preparation,” graduate students should
teach side by side with the most gifted
educators within their departments and
only progress to intimately sized classes
after sufficient mentoring.

That way, they can‘be more easily evalu-
ated by their students; they can learn to
emulate the best faculty, and they won’t

products in different quantities, and theystate
looked at private industry as a model for
package reform.

However, this proposal was reminiscent
of the state’s 2010 reform where grocery
stores gained the ability to sell beer. This
“reform” was based on the model of sales in
privatized states, but also came with Penn-
sylvania’s own unique stipulations. These
laws requiried customers to buy beer from an
enclosed area where other groceries weren’t

allowed to be brought in, and stated that ‘

alcohol wasn’t allowed to enter the store
even after purchase. '

This incident once again proved that the
state has trouble in making alcoholic pur-
chases customer—fri‘endly. ’

Those still in doubt that full privatization
is the way to go should realize that Pennsyl:
vania has been building their reforms on the
model of states that have already privatized
alcohol sales unsuccessfully.

At this point, with the many i1l—conceived

. alcohol reforms the state has thrown at resi-

dents, it’s clear that we should just go straight
to other states’ models — i.e., privatiza-
tion — because the pleasure of opening a
beer with friends on a hot summer day really
shouldn’t be this hard. I

Tips for sorting Oakland trash from Oakland treasure C

John Lavanga and Matt Singer
T/ze Pitt News Staff

For the broke and shameless, the mad
dash to move back into Oakland creates a
veritable cornucopia of options to furnish
their undoubtedly squalid living condi-
tions. The streets have flooded with an
abundance of furnishing options and a
corresponding tide of thrifty students
ravenously picking through the piles
to claim their spoils. The race is on to

 

  

become theking of Oakland’s sidewalk

scavengers. ‘ 

But with so many damp sofas and pos-
sibly ﬁxable DVD players to choose from,
how does one discern which pieces are
the best fit for them? Below are some
simple guidelines that will allow even the
greenest of freebie-finders, to become a
cold, ruthless vulture of the streets.

Etiquette .

In the unforgiving world. of sidewalk
snatching, there is a ﬁne line between
what is and isn’t acceptable. However, the

H ‘

l '

l  

1    

, 

  can It only valldi

  

-streets govern themselves, and those who

break the unwritten rules of the_scaven—

ge_r code will find that retribution isn’t

far off. i «
Above all else, it is imperative that

scavengers develop their ability to dis— »

cern what has been abandoned from what
waits to be moved to a new location. If
someone is clearly moving out of their
home, scavengers would be wise to hold
off on grabbing the object in question.
That’s called stealing. This also applies
to any items restin on porche Give the

   

  

movers a wide berth, but move swiftly
once it’s obvious that the move is com-
plete.

Once an object has become forfeit to
the Oakland streets, thelines are blurred,
and it becomes difficult to know who has
ﬁrst claim to these objects. Conventional
wisdom might tell scavengers that neigh-
bors have firstdibs, but the brutal truth
is that once the hunt is on, the concept
of dibs no longer applies. Instead, the‘
streets favor the swift. The first person
to snatch up an object owns it. .

However, anyone scavenging the Oak-
land streets is only entitled to what he

or she can carry, so strategy is key. It’s-

important to prioritize accordingly.
Furniture V .
During the harvest season, to say that

there is a glut of furniture on Oakland’s

streets would be animmense understate-

ment. However, this abundance does not"

excuse a lack of caution when seeking
out the perfect porch sofa. If furniture
hunters aren’t careful, they might wind
up with a very small and itchy problem.
-After nearly being eradicated in the
U.S. by the middle of the 20th century,
bed bugs are once again plaguing modern
homes and their residents. Worse yet,
they’ve become harder to kill. According
to a joint statement from the Centers for
Di-sease Control and Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, “Some bed bug popula—
tions are resistant to almost all pesticides
registered to treat them,” meaning that
once there’s an infestation, it’s going to
take a lot more than- a couple canisters
of DDT to get rid of it. One oftthe most
common ways bed bugs enter a home is
through stowed furniture, so think twice
before grabbing that sketchy futon.
Once the cleanliness of the bed has
been established, the key to selecting

the right bed is to have a strong under—_

standing of yourneeds. Whileyou-might
think that totally sweet memory foam
mattress will turn your bed into Pitts-
burgh’s tantric sex hot spot, it might just

make your closet of a bedroom even more ’

cramped. Furthermore, it-is important
to administer a jumpgtest b.yjumping‘ up
‘and down on the mattress with a couple
of your friends. A
Along with beds, couches are ground
zero for bed bug infestations. The situa-
tion must be handled delicately. Thebest
approach is to scope out a mover who
might be abandoning his or her couch and
snatch it up during the delicate window
when the piece of furniture will likely be
infestation free. ‘It’s not always going to
work, but if you had another option, you
probably wouldn’t be scampering down
alleyways to furnish your home.
On the other hand, working, uphol-

Miseducation: The root of the War on terror

Nick Voutsinos .
Columnist

_ Terrorism is an extremely  con-
cern for most Americans. After 9/11_, every
household had an opinion onforeign policy,
and the consensus was that diplomacy was

V out of the question. Thus began the extensive

war on terror.

Now that we have spent all of this lime
and money ﬁghting terrorism, are we still
unaware of the cause? Even after all of this,
it continues to unnerve us because we sﬁll
cannot comprehend what leads one to com-
mit such acts of violence.

The actual deﬁnition of terrorism makes
it even more incomprehensible. Merriam-
Webster describes it as “the systematic use
of terror especially as a means of coercion.”
The U.S. governmenthas convuluted the un-
derstanding of terrorism evenﬁrrther, espe-
cially when it comes to ranking individuals
on terror watch lists. For instance, Nelson
Mandela, the man who became the epitome
of global peace and progress, was only re-
moved the list ﬁve years ago. It is diﬂicult
to comprehend how the list unjustly skews
the deﬁnition of a terrorist to be “an enemy
of the United State governments interests

‘ and/or its allies.” But real terrorism, the

kind that has been committed for centuries,

 

is only causbed by ignorance. Fundamental
ideologues rely on gullible people whom they
can teach to hate things they know nothing
about. Itwas true of the Spanish inquisition

and the conquistadors, and it’s true now of

the Taliban and its training of suicide bomb-
ers. It is much easier to coerce an unedu-
catedpopulacethan an educated contingent.
Consequently, in order tomaintain a level
of authority, 'I‘aliban-controlled areas in the
Middle East have routinely shut off any form
of education that does not conform to their
organization’s agenda. The Tahban has ac-
complished this mainly through outlawing

secular schools or by disallowing certain
groups of people to become educated, par-.

ticularly women. ,
Malala Yousafzai grew up in one these
areas in Swat,  She experienced
ﬁrst hand the Taliban's war against educa-
tion, as they destroyed nearly 401 schools.
Desperate for the chance to receive an edu-
cation, she created a blog in the hope that
the world would recognize such injustice.
Unfortunately, the Taliban targeted her for
her activism, and she was subsequenﬂy shot
be a Taliban gunamn on her school bus.
She miraculously survived the assassination
attempt and was. brave enough to explain
to the UN and the world exactly why this
atrocity occurred. “The extremists were,
and they are, afraid ofbooks and pens..” She

went on to explain what needed tobe done
to effectively thwart terror. “One child, one
teacher, one pen and one book can change
the world. Education is the only solution.
Education ﬁrst.” Malala makes avery astute
point. In the Middle East, a great number of
children are not receiving a primary educa-
tion. And many of those who join terror-
ist organizations are illiterate. So when all
you know is whatever the aforementioned
terrorists force-feed you, your view of the
worldwill certainly be skewed toward their
fundamentalist-extremist agenda. This is
exactlywhy formal educalionwas oppressed
in Malala’s homeland and why her intentions
wereseenas athreattotheTaliban.
Furthermore, when one does not have
access to education, joininga terrorist orga-
nization is a viable option to escape poverty
and sustain survival. Terrorist organizations

*arewell—awareofthisandtendtorecruitin

impoverished areas that lack a formal edu-
cational structure. The promises of money,
adventure, a heavenly aﬁerlife or anything
that can remove one from destitution can
be convincing enough for someone to join.

Nevertheless, while ignorance in the
Middle East remains at the issue’s core,
enlightening individuals here in the US. is
also vital in combating terrorism.

As mentioned before, the U.S. gov-
ernment’s view on terrorism seems to be

   
 

somewhat distorted. It is impossible to ﬁght
terror through drone strikes and to “sup-
port democracy” at the same time, when
an overwhelming majority of citizens in the
Middle East oppose them. The vicious cycle
of terrorism will just continue if we remain
focused on merely eliminating enemies of
the state instead ofbeneﬁting the real physi-
cal needs of the Middle Eastern population.

Yet, our foreign policy in the Middle East
seems to suffer from historical amnesia and
ignorance to the wishes of the average per-
son. We should have learned from Iraq and
Afghanistan that shock and awe policies
only strengthen the cause and justiﬁcation
of terrorist groups, and they provide no
long-term solution.

For example, the better part of the Paki-
stani population opposes terrorist orga-

nizations such as the Taliban, while also ‘

opposing U.S. drone strikes in their country.
Historically, we have supported corruption
in the Pakistani government by making deals
to eliminate both enemies of the Pakistani
and U.S. government, thus, designating
drone strikes as “legal,” though not neces-
sarily democratic, and consequently caus-
ing our statements and actions to appear
hypocritical. Instead of recognizing this
and working with the Pakistani people to

DOCTOR SUSS

Nordenberg Hall hopefully the bef puswide changes

-3 Stephen Suss
Columnist

The newly built Nordenberg Hall will for-
ever commemorate Pitt’s soon—to—retire
chance1lor’s legacy, but this honor might
go down as the least signiﬁcant of Mark
‘ ‘-Nordenberg’s many achievements- ’

That being said, Nordenberg Hall will
be a freshman dormitory more elaborate
than any that preceded it and will hope-
fully signal further changes in student
living conditions. The question is, does
this new residence hall mark the gen-
esis ofa Pitt that offers more and more
amenities to its students, or is this new
building a unique creation?

Unlike Nordenberg Hall, many ofthe

freshman dorms on Pitt’s campus are "

old, and with their significant age come

“ ‘some issues. For instance, central air is

something many students yearned for
in their first year living in dorms such
as Lothrop and Holland. Considering
Pittsburgh’s dramatic seasonal changes
in temperature, students were often left
either freezing cold or sweltering hot
while living in these halls.

In addition, Lothrop in particular was
also known for being dark and gloomy all
year round, despite the weather outside.
However, these residence halls and their

V/‘stark features serve as a sort of rite of
passage, with the promise of better living
conditions, such as Bouquet Gardens, in

the future.

Although the nicer and newer sopho-
more dorms have the amenities and am-
biance that students missed their fresh-
man year, several of these dorms, such
as Pennsylvania and Panther halls on
the hill, came with the cost of being far
from central campus and classes and,
well, on a hill.

Nordenberg Hall, in this sense, will
even have advantages when compared
to sophomore dorms. Like its modern
counterparts, it’s new and has _central
air, but it’s also conveniently located near
the Cathedral and most freshman classes.
Students will also have flat-screen TVs
provided in their room, something un-
heard of in previous dorms aside from
the newest additions to the Bouquet Gar-
dens complex. In addition, the hall will
feature a ﬁtness center, a rec room and
an outdoor patio.

Although many of these features were
available to freshmen before, they were
never as easily accessible as they will be
to the students living in Nordenberg. Pitt
has been rising in the ranks academi-
cally under the leadership of Chancel-
lor Nordenberg, and his residence hall
might signal an important shift in the
University’s layout to reﬂect and add to
the strides that have already been made.

Land has always been scarce in Oak-
land, and as the University has grown

playing in the Steelers’ Three Rivers Sta-
dium. Where Towers once hosted gradu-

freshmen who often move on to converted

houses in South Oakland, which once
housed immigrantfamilies.

As it’s been, there are few buildings
at the University that have not been built
over something. Likewise, Nordenberg
Hall will replace the old University Place

Humanizing terrorists distracts

Natalie Russell *
For The Pitt News

‘The writing was literally on the wall: “The 

government is killing our innocent civilians.”
Boston Marathonbomber Dzhokhar“_]ahar”
Tsarnaev scrawled this manifesto on the panels
of the 22-foot motorboat he sought refuge in
after the attack.
Severely wounded from a confrontation

"’with the police that left his brother dead, he lay '

quietly in the boat for 18 hours, scribbling his
defense as thousands of law enforcement oﬂ‘i-
cials hunted for him in a nearby 20-block area.
“I can’t stand to see such evil go unpunished,”
he wrote. “We Muslims are one body, you hurt

‘one, you hurt us all.”

There’s a popular argument that human-
izing terrorists glamorizes the act of terror-
ism, but the real problem is that every attempt
at humanization only distracts readers from
concrete issues such as the way in which U.S.
foreign policy and war crimes overseas fuel

' the attacks to begin with. Despite Tsarnaev’s
unambiguous explanation, the Rolling Stone ar-
ticle that provoked so much controversy barely
mentions it amongpages of trivial biographical
details and quotes echoing the vague question

'-.-.,~.“,T4, qnz _, \'l.¢

of “what went wrong?” .

But it’s the humanizing story that sells __

magazines. -

More importantly, criticizing U.S. foreign
policy and citing warcrimes in any substantial
'way isn’t exactly rewarded. In fact, it might

earn you life in prison. Remember this was
the sentence given to Bradley’ Manning, the
soldier arrested for leaking a classiﬁed video‘

of an American helicopter ﬁring on a group of -

innocent journalists in Baghdad. A

So, instead of a Manning-esque approach,
we get a plastered image of a shaggy—haired,
doe-eyed young man and page after page of tes-
timonies from neighbors and wrestling coaches
insisting he was a “good kid.” v

Ifhumanization is the goal, it might serve
animportantpurpose. Instead of a two-dimen-
sional villain, readers see a human being. This
makes it a lot harder to dismiss terrorists as
some mystical force of evil, thus, encouraging
a more honest look at concrete motivations. A

My primary contention is that journalists too
often end their proﬁles with one giant question
mark about human nature, which — worse than
exonerating the terrorist in question — doesn’t
allow responsibility to fall on anyone.

The media focuses on nebulous facets of

chology that certainly plays an important role

instead of, say, joining an activist organization.
But to ignore intelligible motivations — such
as mass civilian murders in the Iraq War — is
simply irresponsible. _ ,°

status in the National Honor Society and 
response to losing a wrestling match in high
school. Because what we’re really talking about
here isn’t just about how one person can be
driven to violence. f V‘ , I ' l V V 

But maybe a caricature of Tsarnaev and his
accomplice brother, Tamerlan, is the best the
media can do when avoiding more complex

questions about foreign policy. The coverage

actually is an exaggerated, two-dimensional
sketch with no ‘real meaning or answers be-

When the only answers we receive after a
terrorist attack are the details of the terrorist’s

childhood, maybe we’re not asking the right

. ANKUR, DO YOU WANT MORE?

I Hepatitis: A largely underpublicized killer worldwide

S Ankur Sakaria
Opz'm'0ns Editor

, The Institute for Health Metrics and Evalua-
tion at the University of Washington recently
‘published a study exemplifying how rampant
and prevalent of an epidemic hepatitis is on
the global scale when compared with HIV.

The Institute was able to plot the amount

'  of HIV deaths occurring per hepatitis death
, Sand vice versa in an effort to display which
countries saw hepatitis or HIV to be more of

an issue. They additionally were able to clas-

' sify what countries had a high and low ratio
of either virus. And results were astounding.
For instance, in Mongolia, for every HIV
death, there are 88.4 hepatitis-related deaths.
In Egypt, for every HIV death, there are 107.7

hepatitis-related deaths. In Iraq, there are -

193.4 hepatitis deaths per HIV death. These
countries are classiﬁed under the high—ratio
demographic of the hepatitis virus.

In countries located in the heart of HIV—in—
fected zones such as Angola, Congo, Uganda,
Sudan and the similar, the situation is evi-
dently different. South Africa, for example,
poses a disconcerting rate of 58.9 HIV deaths
per hepatitis death, the highest according to
the study. Central and southern Africa seem
to be the exception to news of hepatitis being
more widely affecting than HIV. Africa has

dealt with HIV for decades, instilling upset-
ting rates of HIV deaths per year.
HIV might be the world’s best known virus

‘ simply because of the advertisement and

recognition it has received globally. From
concert beneﬁts and fundraisers, to television
commercials and celebrity support, the virus
and its effects are plastered across campaigns

research alone proves that hepatitis is a ram-
pant and debilitating virus that affects avast
majority of people across the globe. It might
not be the virus that affects the most people,
but it is the virus that kills more people than
HIV in most countries.

What is truly frightening is that the hub of
the HIV advertising movement exists in the

This research alone proves that
hepatitis is a rampant and debilitating
virus that affects a vast majority of
people across the globe.

to prevent its spread.

The increased attention this virus has
received is beneﬁcial: Those who are sexu-
ally active should have_the ability to obtain
widely available information about an issue
to hopefully gain a better-understanding of
its effects. What is problematic, however, is
the lack of attention other viruses receive -
hepatitis in this case.

And here is where an issue exists: This

United States, a place that sees more hepatitis
deaths per HIV death. To be precise: for every
HIV death, there are three hepatitis-related
deaths.

Yet, the hepatitis advertising movement
seems hardly as prosperous as that of the
HIV movement, thus, painting an especially
dismal series of events. Those who attempt
to be safe and promote good health through
educating others on such topics now arise

 

doubt in the minds of others: Are they educate‘
ing our society with the wrong information?
Well, the information might not be wrong,
but what it is, is inapplicable to countries
such as the United States.

Nations such as China (10.9 hepatitis
deaths per HIV death), Germany (22.9 hepagr
titis deaths per HIV death) and Britain (20.7

hepatitis deaths per HIV" death) — all of
which are inﬂuential global powers —— need
to conduct the same applicable information
as the United States with regard to educating
the populace on hepatitis.

Ultimately, with efforts to increase aware-
ness about such avirus, one can assume that
the issue will become less of an actual issue in
terms of educating society about it. Tackling
the virus from a clinical standpoint is simply
a topic for another day, and one that is much
more difficult to challenge. _,

Overall, hepatitis is a virus that needs se-
rious attention. The study, reporting ﬁgures

from data collected in 2010 — the latest data
analyzed thus far -—— found that 1.445 million
died from hepatitis that year, with HIV killing
1.446 million people. ’

Hepatitis is not a virus to neglect, and one
can assume that the death count will only rise
if the virus is not advertised as much, if not
more, than HIV. I

Students must be wary of attracting unwanted pests when pilfering discarded items,

from Oaklandis sidewalks. Ben Brownlee | Staff Photographer , -

valuable, regardless of aesthetics. How-

ever, that doesn’t mean you can’t target the
nicer items. The best strategy here is to ﬁll
your needs ﬁrst, and then go out looking for
more visually pleasing furniture to replace
the junk you grabbed the ﬁrst time around.
If the unwanted pieces are put back on the
sidewalk, it’s not going to hurt anyone.
Appliances 1 ‘ ' l -
Appliances can be just as common on
the streets of South Oakland in the same
postlease time period that sees a ﬂood of
— possibly bug-infested — furniture. And

7 while things such as a secondhand toaster

oven found on Semple Street might seem

like a hidden treasure, pickers must be wary. ‘

If you ﬁnd a vacuum on the street, it
probably has some sort of defect or would
have otherwise beenpacked up with the rest
of someone’s stuff. Considering that you
can literally always use a vacuum, if it was

100 percent functioning, then it wouldn’t*

be sitting outside. But if you’re desperate
and willing to compromise on performance,
then sidewalk vacuums can provide some
utility. Just don’t be surprised if it dies on
you the ﬁrst time you try to clean up siom
postbanger puke. ’
Televisions, on the other hand, should be

viewed as categorically avoidable. They’re -

heavy and cumbersome and often times
have some internal damage because of
Pittsburgh’s ever-precipitous climate. Fur—
thermore, they become a prime target for
late-night shenanigans. Even if they look ﬁne
on the outside, their internal parts might be

compromised by 2o—something rapscallions
gleefully smashing away.

- Stereos or sound systems aren’t worth
your valuable efforts during the freebie rush:
The time wasted untangling wires, attaching
chords and lugging speakers is too much,
considering the inevitable discovery that the
bass is blown or the entire system is fried. No
one tosses out perfectly working speakers.

Always take toasters.

Knick-knacks ,

First and foremost, keep this in mind:
Your attempts to refurbish some random
tchotchke doesn’t make you chic or artistic.
And even though many college homes are
already a veritable hodgepodge of uncoordi~
nated items hastily thrown together, adding

in a some Wornrout wall art from god know’s A

where won’t make you seem “different.”
You should only pluck a miscellaneous

item off the street if it’s a one—in-a—r’nillior1

ﬁnd. Butthat’s not to say that weirder is

_ always better: Your roommates probably

won’t,enjoy coming home to ﬁnd a creepy
clown doll sitting in your living room or a
rickety table spray—painted with the word
“love” leaning on your porch.

That being said, you can’t write otfknick—

V knacks altogether. There’s always the odd

chance you might stumble upon the perfect
set of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cereal
bowls or A-Team limited edition collector’s

For commuter students, integration is key

Jonathan Fischer
,’C0lumm'st
ll:-Ther.e’s more to being a commuter student
-Ethan living off campus while attending
If "college. I

I  Commuter students are, in essence, a

flfoolhardy, capable and generally oppor-
I tunistic group looking to survive among
' the many others who barricade themselves

I within the campus walls.
V’  I recently spoke to a group of prospec-
I l tive students on behalf of the School of

« _. Information Sciences as an undergradu-

.? ate alumnus, when someone asked me,

 ,.;‘fWhat has been the hardest thing about
I.go‘ing to Pitt?” - -

After giving it a moment of thought, in

 brain cells unanimously agreed:

“Being a commuter.” V

There is an importance to the mentality
. necessary to being a successful commuter
{ at Pitt. A commuter needs to be ready to

 accommodate to adversities-. I found this
-' out on day one. .

, During my Pittstart orientation, all
1 students were told to sit according to their
respective on—campus housing. We —as in
all six of us commuters — assimilated with
. the‘ Tower B group, which was strike one
against us as regular students. Some of us

were transfers, yet all of our paraphernalia

- ...........'....._..(,._...  ._. , .....__..__

was labeled Class of 2011: strike two.
Toward the end of the orientation, our
last treat came in the form of an umbrel-
la. Unfortunately, in order to receive an
umbrella, we had to state where we were
living on campus. In my situation as a
commuter who had relied heavily on the
Port Authority bus system, an umbrella
is an essential travel item. But, alas, the
“commuters from Tower B” didn’t make
the cut to receive one: strike three.
Technically, I am still a qualiﬁed and
weather—hardened commuter at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh who is enrolled in
grad school part-time. I still live in the

South Hills, a good twenty or ninety -

minutes from Oakland, depending on
the traffic.

I had written ab’out and explored ear-
lier this year the importance of integrating
as a commuter. Simply put, commuter life
can be difficult, especially when being
welcomed to a new college and possibly
a new city. I somewhat j okingly suggested
we establish a commuter dating service
to take place in our commuters’ lounge,
located in the William Pitt Union, as a way
for our kind to feel more integrated.’I still
feel compelled to bring commuter inte-
gration and activities to light once more.

There needs to be realistic expectations
if you’re a traveler within the bounds of

Pitt. .

“I think the hardest part of being a
commuter is the lack of amenities and in-
convenience. A commuter student lounge
is rarely a home away from home, and if
you don’t carry home with you wherever
you go, chances are you will feel the dis-
tance pretty hard,“ says Marika Stettner,
a former vice president of the Commuter
Student Association at Pitt.‘ “As a com-
muter student, my life is in my bag. Some-
times, that’s the only thing I really have,”
she said.

There is light at the end of the tunnel,
and, fortunately, things have tremendous-
ly improved since I was introduced as a
commuter in 2007.

The Commuter Student Program’s web-
site boasts housing during orientation
and other programs speciﬁcally tailored
to commuters’ needs. There also appears
to be an entire commuter day dedicated
to our ragtag, hearty group.

I’m happy to see programs such as the
commuter pods, which are led by First
Year Mentors. Each ﬁrst—year commuter is
assigned a commuter pod, which functions
much like a residence hall does by creating
a smaller community of students at Pitt.
Each pod has its own Facebook group,
through which that pod’s assigned First
Year Mentor can communicate with the

pod members to encourage involvemeﬁii
on campus and plan events. These types
of programs did not exist years ago, but
if they had, I’d have been the first in line.

From one commuter student to anoth-
er, my best advice is to prepare for a bit of
adversity along with additional planning,
It can be a difficult challenge if you’re not
using all of the resources available. Sa-
mantha Faulds, the 2008-2009 Commuter
Student Association president, agrees.

“Every student will have some difficul-
ties during their college years. When I
was a freshman, it was difficult for me to
connect with individuals and groups on
campus. In addition to commuting via two
buses, I worked as a student employee in
between classes and part-time in the eve-
nings. Through commuter student events,
I met a great group of friends and was able
to branch out into bigger and better things
at Pitt,” Faulds, said.

Now that these programs exist and
there is a new burst of momentum in
commuter-tailored programs here at Pitt,
incoming commuters have an obligation to
further encourage and make use of these
programs.

. Just remember to always carry a spare
umbrella. I

N etﬂix: the correctpway to procras

John Lavanga and Matt Singer
' The Pitt News Staff

The beginning of another semester at Pitt
beckons one of the most important decisions
students must make in their college careers:
how to best use the countless hours they will
inevitably spend procrastinating lab reports,
papers and so—called group study sessions:
At The Pitt News, we understand your plight
and have assembled a go-to list of the best
binge-worthy Netﬂix titles for any student
who is serious about procrastination.

Comedies

“Archer”

Sterling Malory Archer is the entitled,
lacrosse—playing, scotch—sipping, woman-
izing and turtleneck—wearing wiseacre that
every college boy dreams of becoming. Along
with Archer’s hilarious antics are a hodge-
podge of supporting characters, ‘all with their

own neuroses, substance issues and jarringly

witty dialogue. The result is a show that takes
thejames Bond—era spy story and providesa
comedic spin so clever viewers should watch
with Google on hand for all the references.

Notable quote: “I’m getting my turtle-
neck. I’m not defusing a bomb in this!” Ster-
ling Archer V

“Scrubs”

“Scrubs” has carved out a special place
in the hearts of countless TV-watchers with

Zach Braff’s zany daydreams and one of the
best bromances in modern television his-
tory. Detractors say it’s repetitive, slapstick
and sappy. But it’s the show’s formulaic na-

‘ ture that makes it perfect for binge watching.

Each episode marches on the same as those
before it, creating the sitcom equivalent of
a security blanket for those looking to hide
from the anxieties of life.

Notable quote: “I’m talking legitimate
doctors, turtle head. Here, pee pants is a
pathologist, so he doesn’t count. Johnson
is a dermatologist, which is Greek for fake
doctor and please don’t even get me started
on you four surgeons.” Dr. Perry Cox

. “Parks and Recreation”

Although anyone who’s a ﬁrst-time viewer
might be slightly wary after a slow-to-start
ﬁrst season, “Parks and Rec” has evolved
into a serious contender on any list of ﬁinny
Netﬂix titles. The show pretty neatly lays
out a slew of comedic tropes that its charac-
ters fall into, while still delivering relatively
nuanced characters and relationships. It’s
goofy and simple, but its heart is always in
the right place. Buried beneath mounds of
meme—worthy one-liners, there are funda-
mental discussions that occur in terms of
the role of government and a civil society.

Notable quote: “When people get a little
too chummy with me I like to call them by the
wrong name to let them know I don’t really

care aboufthem.” Ron Swanson

lDrama"sV'_'_'

“Houseﬁ'bf Cards”

If “The West Wing” is the must-watch
series for every would—be political opera-
tive that wants to understand what goes on
inside the’_Beltway, then “House of Cards”
should be a mandatory check on the syl-
labus to becoming the sort of duplicitous,
cutthroat Brutus who plays an equal role in
keeping Washington ﬁmctioning. It’s a grip-
ping, 13-episode rally of political corruption
and drama, all shot in a stark, Instagram—like

color that accents the dark storyline. The

plot might be hard to follow at times, b.ut
that’s ﬁne —— once you start watching, you’ll
want to sit through the entire series to fully
understand the big picture. -

Notable quote: “There is no solace above
or below. Only us. Small. Solitary. Striving.
Battling one another. I pray to myself. For
myself.” Frank Underwood A

“Mad Men”

Like “Archer,” some of the staples of “Mad

Men” include excessive alcohol consump-
tion, misogyny and suits. However, for each I

pithy retort in the FX pseudo—spy comedy,
the AMC powerhouse that begins with the
life and times of a 1960s ad agency delivers
a showcase of human pain and oft—faltering
senses of identity, Since the plot’s times-
pan covers more than a decade, viewers can

tinate during the school year

watch relationships build, crumble, repair‘,
themselves and then end all over againf V
There isn’t much death or action, with the
brilliant use of sex and dialogue instead pav-
ing the way for an artfully crafted drama
that enraptures fans who are eager to see
who’s going to cheat on who or gun for each
other’s job next. ' L”

Notable quote: ,“Not to get too deep be-
fore the cocktail hour, but do I needto re-
mind you of the ﬁnite nature of life?” Roger
Sterling

“The X—Files”

While most Pitt students likely missed out
on this show during it’s heyday, it remains
one of the most treasured and broadly en-
joyed sci-ﬁ shows to ever grace the small
screen. The show’s brilliance comes mostly
from the incredible chemistry that devel-
oped between David Duchovny and Gillian

' Anderson over the show’s nine seasons. An?”

derson’s role as the skeptical Dana Scully
perfectly balances the enthusiasm of Ducho-
vny’s Fox Mulder in seeking out the super-
natural in every investigation. And it’s not
just the show that had America rethink the
sci-ﬁ genre. “The X—Files” also launched the
career of Vince Gilligan, who serves as the
driving force behind “Breaking Bad.”

Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Brian Cury likes to tell people ,
that he enjoys bringing post-

card views to life, and as the

founder and CEO of Earth-

Cam, he gets to do just that.

The company maintains and

operates live webcam feeds

of famous locations such as

Times Square and Abbey

Road Studios.

Now, EarthCam is bring-

,.. .,,4....»+ _

ing another postcard view to
life, albeit one of a man who
has since deceased.

Since his Aug. 6 birthday,
the grave of Andy Warhol,
the Pittsburgh native whose
art made him a cultural icon
in the 19605, is viewable on-

line at any time thanks to the
combined efforts of Earth-
Cam and the Andy Warhol
Museum on a project called
Figment.

The idea came from a con-
versationbetween Cury and
Eric Shiner, the director of
the Warhol Museum. After
setting up live camera exhib-
its at the museum in the past,
Shiner and Cury were think-
ing about “the next great
place to put a camera” and
decided on Warhol’s resting
place in Bethel Park’s St.
John the Baptist Byzantine
Catholic Cemetery.

“As far as we are aware,
this is the only camera that
shows a grave site 24 hours,
seven days a week,” said

‘ * .322?“ 

Joshua Jeffrey, the Warhol
Museum’s manager of digi-
tal engagement. “And with
that came some interesting
challenges.”

According to Cury, put-
ting the cameras up was the
easy part. With the help of
the cemetery’s gravedigger,
power lines were buried af-
ter being laid through the
cemetery in the most un-
obtrusive means possible.
Once powered, the cameras
then rely on 4G data service
to transmit the images they
capture. .

Additionally, the cameras
are not onlyable to record,
but can also take detailed
snapshots and add effects
that give the images a pop-

art look, providing What;
Cury calls a “very Warhol‘- V

like screen print effect.” .

“What you’re seeing when
you’re looking at that experi-
ence there is the -best of our
technology,” he said.

As of now, Jeffrey says
Figment is slated to continue
indefinitely, with no reason
to end the project in sight.
EarthCam has also agreed
to continue to maintain and
operate the cameras and
other technology necessary
to keep it operational.

The project’s' name pays
homage to a‘ Warhol quote

from his book, “America,” j
, in which the artist said he

was never able to understand

why people don’t vanish

when they die because the

; world keeps going about its_

concerns, just without the
deceased‘. He said that he
didn’t‘want an epitaph or
name on his tombstone and
would prefer it to be blank.

“Well, actual1y,_I’d like it
to say ‘ﬁgment,”’ '

 

ends. ‘ 
]effrey’s preferred inter-

‘ pretation of the quote sees

the greatest work of—..l;l,Varhol

as Warhol himself. A b"

“He really created a per-

sona and created an image ‘

in the 1960s around which
he created his work. ‘And he

HAYES

TPN: Did you come in thinking you were
going to learn how to become a poet sud-
denly?

TH: No. I had a graduate fellowship, so I
actually just thought I would do it because I
had a fellowship, and then I would maybe go
back home. I wasn’t thinking about being a
poet. Again, I didn’t know what that meant.

Here’s the funny thing. The professor,
Lynn Emanuel —-— and now she’s a colleague
—— she’s the only person from my time as a
student that’s there. There was a moment
when I spoke with Lynn, and I said that I
thought I was gonna drop out. I was just

I felt like, ‘Oh, you know, I think I’m gonna

ﬁnd a job and just do something else,’ and
she said to me, ‘You could. I think you could
probably fare OK if you decided this wasn’t
for you.’ But when she said that, when she
gave me permission to stop, that’s when I
decided I wasn’t going to stop.

But that weird conversation I found en-
couraging in a weird way, and, really, as soon
as we ﬁnished talking, I decided I was going
to stay in the program.

” TPN: Do you think the city affected the
way you developed as a poet?

TH: I do think you need a landscape.
I need people that are interesting, so it
wouldn’t be enough to go back to South
Carolina on a farm. .

A poet can’t be a poet in a vacuum, and
that’s what I learned in Pittsburgh. As long
as I was trying to not just be in a library
and not just be in a classroom, I was always
ﬁnding ways to write and things to write.

I do still believe that. I still try to have
experiences that are bigger than just the
classroom space. And that’s part of what
I teach —— pursuing a world that’s larger
than your art.

TPN: Do you think your limited expe-
rience in creative writing classrooms as
an undergrad affects the Way you teach ‘an
undergraduate class?

TH: You know, the irony of a creative

writing class and being a creative writer is
that writing is such a solitary act. So you’re
always trying to balance this thing that you
really do alone with the fact that you have
an audience. Sometimes it’s an audience of
your peers, or readers that you never meet,
or teachers. So, for me, I’ve always tried to
ask everybody at the table what our role
is. Whether we look at the work as other
writers, or we look at it as a reader — and
I would say not as a reader — and so, when
you bring in your poem or you bring in your
story, we should look at it from a writer’s
perspective. I

I’m always trying to make my students

«aware that [their work] is a living thing and

that the person is at the table. Our job is
not to offer a passive critique, as if it were
a movie or something.

TPN: Are there any harsh truths about
life as a creative type that would-be writers
should know about?

TH: The harsh truth is if you’re not good,
youjre gonna have a little trouble. There are
mediocre [writers] who make a living, but
of course nobody starts out wanting to be
mediocre. You know, it’s the same harsh
truths as sports. If you love sports, that

-doesn’t mean you’re gonna go to the NBA

or the NFL. You can still be a fan, you can
love basketball and have access to fit and
wear all the clothes, but you’re not going
to make a living at it.

It’s harder to know as an artist when, in
fact, you aren’t good. Sometimes people tell
you that, and they’re wrong. People say, ‘I
don’t understand this. I don’t think you have
what it takes.’ In basketball, if you score 80
points in a game, you know that was real.
So in general, I don’t grade people’s poems.
I do not try to devalue people’s poems, say-
ing, ‘This is an A poem or a B poem’ because
I don’t think we know all the time. I don’t
want to be the one who says to the writer,
‘He’s not good enough.’

But I do know it’s a harsh truth for the
writer that they might not be good enough.
They can only score two points. But that’s
not my job. E '

Jeffrey said. “He wanted them to look at

For Cury, the project, which EarthCam
ﬁnanced in its entirety, is a way of giving
back and creating art with technology.

“Andy partially inspired me tp create.

thinks the project is in line with his uncle’s

artistic ventures. He thinks that his uncle, —

upon seeing the camera that now broad-
casts his resting place, would have said,
“‘Oh gee, I should have thought of that!”’

Warhola says his uncle didn’t set limits
on what he captured as part of. everyday
life and its various angles. That being said,
he feels that the live camera feed is an apt,

ver the last several years, a certain anxi-
ty has unleashed among the masses of
iterature enthusiasts around the world:
hat will become of the paperback book?
ven further, what is going to happen to
ur society if everything — even palpable
ext — becomes digitized?
V While some swear by the ease and ac-
essibility of their Kindle or other e-read-
r, others worry that the decline of the

V ook as a physical object will adversely

ffect our ability to inspire a love of the
written word infuture generations.
But Jamie Skye Bianco, a former Pitt

~ English professor who recently accepted

position in NYU’s English department,
elieves that such worries are groundless.
‘Our children are reading books. What
orm those books are in may change, but,
then again, the form of books has always
en changing,” she says.

A Bianco urges those who are concerned
with the decline of the paperback to re-

‘ member, “Storytelling has always been
‘something that took place in different

prms and platforms because long before
we had novels and books of poetry, we

had oral storytelling.”

As someone who has taught both
conventional English courses as well as
digital ones — including Pitt’s Compos-
ing Digital Media class and special top-
ics courses and seminars such as Digital
Storytelling — Bianco believes that the

debate between paper and digital text ‘

is “not a ‘versus.’ It’s an ‘and.”’ In this
way, then, the addition of a new mode of
storytelling — digital storytelling — is
just that: an addition, perhaps naturally
occurring after the advent of the Internet.
But what exactly is digital storytelling?
Digital storytelling’s most popular —

or, more accurately, revenue-building —
form is the video game, the global market
for video games having reached $67 bil-
lion in 2012 with numbers still climbing.
Digital storytelling takes another

- popular form in Facebook, which Bianco
refers to as perhaps the “largest ethno-
graphic database of storytelling on the
planet.” The number of users in March
reached 1.11 billion, meaning more than
1 billion people have chronicled and pub-
T lished theirlives using this mass forum.
But digital storytelling does not be-
gin and end with these popular modes
of storytelling. Instead, because of the
Internet’s multidimensional form, sto-
rytellers have new tools such as audio,

video, web design and hypertext, which
allow for new possibilities in how stories
can be represented and told.

When senior fiction writing major
Kristin Vermilya took a course on digi-
tal storytelling, she was both intrigued
and discontented by the form. She was-
intrigued because it “seemed to be not
necessarily a rejection of the canonical

-or typical framework to how we access

literature, [but] an exploration of ways
to experiment with that framework.” This
exploration of such unchartered territo-
ries, though, was also the source of her
confusio_n.

' Because digital stories often navigate
through a series of hyperlinks, sending
each reader on different twists and turns,
many students were disoriented, even
frustrated, by the nonlinear form. While
English majors are able to speak to the
jump—cut technique employed injohn Dos
Passos’s “The Manhattan Transfer,” or
wield the feminist lens over Sarah Scott’s
“Millenium Hall,” they do not know how
to approach a text such as M-ichaeljoyce’s
“Twelve Blue,” whose navigation and
form were not as simple as a paperback
book’s beginning-middle—end formula.

To adapt to and interpret cybertext,
students have to learn to let go of their

I Digital Storytelling reinvents the narrative

preconceived notions regarding the
“right” way to read a story — previously
something oral or printed on a 2-D piece
of paper —— and open their minds to some-
thing more complicated. The students
do not only have to be concerned with
the text on the page, but also the other
aesthetic elements that affect the reading.
For example, in “Twelve Blue,” the blue
background color lends itself to a more
solemn vibe than, say, vibrant orange or
fuschia. Also, having to use TV—static lines
to. navigate through the text might have
an eerie effect. Readers must, instead,

let their senses —- sight, sound, touch —— »

remain open and perceptive in order to
appreciate the story’s full effect.

The order of reading or navigating D

the text is not significant because there
is no hierarchy of importance with each
page or part of a digital story. Instead,
the story’s effect, created by the overall
subjective experience of encountering
the visual images, the colors on the page,
the meaning of the text, any sound it re-
leases and other navigational choices, is
what distinguishes the story. Because of
this, the reader or navigator is bringing
much to the way the story unfolds. In a

STO RYTELLING

word from jay David Bolter in his book
“Remediation: Understanding New Me-
dia,” it’s about the “process as much as
the product.”

‘Interactivity as a way to distribute
responsibility

When Pitt graduate student Erin An-
derson began creating The Olive Project,
it started out as a personal endeavor to
preserve and safeguard the memory of
her dying grandmother, Olive Patton.
After recording a lengthy interview with
her grandmother about her life, Anderson
created an interactive story that incor-

porated audio, video, pictures, text and
hyperlink navigation to tell her grand-
mother’s story.

But because of her personal attach-
ment, Anderson was “uncomfortable in
having the’ authority in how [her] grand-
mother’s story got told.” Therefore, she
sought to ﬁnd a way to share that respon-
sibility with her readers, resulting in an
interactive project. She made it so that it
was the reader’s choice how to navigate
the text, such aswhich buttons to click
and how long to invest in the project.
Thus, it was the reader’s responsibility
to get as little or much from the story as
he or she pleased.

While some of the interactive navi-

gation might seem random, it does not
mean that the author or creator is lazy
or uncaring for the structure. Instead,
Bianco says, “When you make anything,
it’s not just about, ‘I’m going to throw
something that pops up in my head.’ You
have to form and craft it to communi-
cate.” The aesthetic choices, then, from
the background color, to the navigation,
to the way images move on the page, are
vastly signiﬁcant in telling a perhaps even
fuller, more effective story.

Because there is no template to follow,
like there is for, say, romance novels or
mysteries, digital storytellers must go out
and “find a form, rather than [use] a form
that was already given to us,” Bianco says.

Her students are allowed a lot of free-
dom to ﬁnd the form that best suits their
story, but then she asks her students to
take responsibility for their experiment
and make the most out of that freedom.
“Experimentation actually requires us to
do more, not less,” she adds.

Digital storytelling also allows its cre-
ators more control over how the story is
accessed and by whom. Because someone
can create and upload a project onto _the
Internet without having to go through a
publisher, “It allows more people to be
storytellers,” Bianco says. “Anyone can
tell their stories now and have an audi-
ence, even if that audience is just their
friends.”

Anderson is intrigued by the varied
audience that accessibility allows. The
Olive Project was originally intended for
a very intimate audience, including her
family and friends. Then, at her grand-
mothér’s funeral, a laptop was set up for
guests to explore the project, and, per-
haps, even understand Olive in a different
way. She explains, “It was something my
family could appreciate but also people
who don’t know my grandmother can ap-
preciateﬁ’ Further extending the project’s
visibility, the text has even been u_se'd"in

.some undergraduate courses.

Effects of Digital Storytelling ,

It’s not aboutjwhat we’re leaving be-
hind, but rather, where we’re headed.
Instead of making print books obsolete,
Bianco thinks the digital era will leave “a
huge opening for them to evolve,” causing
people to “become far more inventive.”
Already some books such as Jonathan
Safran Foer’s “Tree of Codes,” — a novel
created through the cutout and erasure
of Foer’s favorite book, “The Street of
Crocodilesf’ by Bruno Schulz — are tak-
ing inspiration from the digitalized form.

Digital storytelling might also allow
for opportunities to teach people about
a certain group’s perspective in a more
creative, less preachy manner. For ex-
ample, an online video game, .Dys4i'a,
teaches players about the daily life of
being a transgendered individual. For this
speciﬁc game, there was a combinationlfli-"of
doing — completing tasks such as shav-
ing the narrator’s mustache or chest, ',or
physically catching her girlfriend’s verbal
attacks, which resulted in the narrator
crying —— and listening to the narrator
tell her story. At the end of the game,
the player or participant is much more
knowledgeable about a transgendered

'person’s daily struggles and, in effect, '
_‘more understanding and socially aware. .

While perhaps interest in literary digi-
tal storytelling projects, such as ethnog-
raphies and short stories, are concentrat-
ed within a niche of interested followers,
the form is becoming more legitimate as
organizations and online journals such
as “The Atavist” and “Kairos” publish

digital literature and sponsor contests -

that heighten awareness for the art form.

PNC Park on Federal Street, is a newcomer
-to the Pittsburgh beer scene, but is a com-
petitor to be reckoned with. Sporting a beer
menu longer than my senior seminar paper,
it is clear that The Beer Market does not
mess around when it comes to its selections.

Requiring its own index, the 5o—page
menu covers everything from Abbey Leffe
Blonde all the way to’ Zatec Pilsner and just
about everything _in between.

If you’re into wine, The Beer Market of-
fers eight high-quality varieties to satisfy
lovers of both white and red. Whatever you
do at Beer Market, don’t go looking for a.

food menu. You won’t ﬁnd one.

The Beer Market serves no food whatso-
ever, choosing to concentrate on libations.
What they will do, however, is order food for
you from just about anywhere in town that

delivers. Also, you are more than welcome to "

bring your own, should you so desire. I have
seen everything there from grilled steaks to
Pop Tarts—all foods are welcome.

More importantly, though, just about
any beer one could ask for is present and
accounted for.

D’s Six Pax and Dogz

Finally, a must for any- Pittsburgh beer
lover is D’s Six Pax and Dogz, located on
Braddock Avenue in Swissvale. Although the
food, mostly a selection of typical bar fare, is

%I’itt student abroad sees parallels between London and The Burgh

Though it lacks London’s size, Pittsburgh has its own sort of vibrance MCT Campus

crippling transition. I’m only here for seven
weeks, so maybe because I knew I had only
a precious few days among these people, I
became numb to the big picture. But hon-
estly, it’s the little quirks that seem to stick
with me.

My friends have travelled all over the
world ~— from Prague and Athens, Greece,

them weeks, even months to adjust to their
new environments. ' . .

to think the transition so far has been fairly
seamless. Maybe it’s because London is an
international hub, with its porous borders
and access to so many other countries, but
there seems to be a culture of “the other”
here that doesn’t alienate or marginalize,
minorities of any genus.

London’s origins date back to the Roman
Empire, and physical heirlooms to the city’s
history pepper the alleyways. And much
of the architecture —— even the buildings
rebuilt after the Great London Fire in 1666
and those walloped by the Blitz during WWII
— resembles some critical time period in
the city’s development.

It’s not the empire that once ruled much
of the world, but London still remains an
international hub, far—reaching not through
a colonial presence, but through diversityr
— from the people, places, affiliations, and
affections to the cityscape itself.

Pittsburgh, steeped in a history of its
own, hasn’t had as much time or the genera-
tions of prosperity to forge such a complex,
open landscape of institutions. And from
the few Londoners who do know where
Pittsburgh is, it is still thought to be at “the
center of the Rust Belt,” a legacy we’ve tried

Most cash—strapped college students will
agreethat the bestkind of food is cheap food.
So when they’re _: pinch and not at allwor-
ried about the nutriﬁonal value of their meals,
they’ll often  a longtime staple of the
collegiate culinary scene: ramen noodles.

Ramen'has foryears been one ofthe cheap-
estfood options available to consumers, with
a single package typically valued at less than
5o’cents. This has made the many varieties

 

of ramen a sort of go-to for college students _

who need to save up their money to spend on
things deemed more important than fulﬁlling
their basic need for sustenance.

The trouble with typical ramen noodle
soups — aside from their ‘enormously high
sodium content and egregiouslack of essential
nutrients — is that no matter which “ﬂavor”
of ramen you choose to ingest, they all taste
pretty much the same. And after eating the
same salty noodles for three meals a day for
a couple weeks, I think that anyone would be

. willing to swear off all forms of pasta for the

rest of eternity. '
So what can students do to add some ﬂavor

typical soup veggies —until they are about half-
cooked. Then add the Ramen noodles and the
enclosed seasoning packet to the water and
stir together until everything is fully cooked
and the ﬂavors have had time to meld.

You can similarly add sliced, cooked chick-
en breast, scrambled eggs or grated cheese

protein and ﬂavor. Though you might have

to shell out some cash for chicken or cheese, ~

the eggs and vegetables should all be pretty
easy on your wallet. , A
Another option is to remove the soup
broth from the equation. You can combine
drained and chilled boiled noodles with cu-
cumbers, tomatoes, sesame seeds andasplash
ofboth white vinegar and sesame oil to create
an Asian-inspired cold noodle salad. Ifyou’re

At the risk of sounding like that one
V Game ofThrones meme on the Internet,
 students who are concerned about their
dress should brace themselves because
fall is coming. ,

This coming season ushers in the re-
turn of frequent pants wearing, which,
for starters, completely changes your
shoe game because some things just don’t
go well with shorts.

Guys can dust off their Clarks, desert
boots and dressier loafers that have been
forced into a_ vernal vacation and also
retire the boat shoes that have likely un-
derwent far, far too much action during
the summer. Whereas summer fashion is
about warmth, vibrancy and excitingly
bright hues, fall warrants a bit more tonal
modesty. It’s the last stop before winter,
which makes everyone bundle up, so sleek
and simple is key.

Expect to see ladies bring their ﬂats
back out, which they can then pair with
their favorite pants or jeans. These will

Walking into Daily Bread’s store feels a lot like
wearing its clothing. The local streetwear brand
is known for its use of rare fabrics — some dat-
ing back as far as the 1800s —— and its store,
which opened in Garﬁeld the week ofjuly 4,
feels like a rare view into a lifestyle that, up to

this point, has been relatively quiet in the city‘

of Pittsburgh.

; Locales such as New York, Los Angeles
and San Francisco have long been hubs for the
streetwear industry, serving as the birthplace
for brands such as Huf, Supreme and Diamond

Supply-

“Pittsburgh never ﬁt into that. That’s exactly .

whylwanted to start Daily Bread. Allthe brands
in Pittsburgh are great, but nobody had that
edge, nobody had people like Mac Miller and

A$AP Rockywearingtheir stuff,” said Bill Niels,

the company’s founder.
 4 Born out ofNiels’ eponymous photo journal,
Daily Bread, the clothing brand grew from a
South Oakland house where Neils, Mac Miller,
and Miller’s managers stayed during the sum-
mer of 2010. That same summer, Miller’s break-
through mixtape K.I.D.S was released — the
iconic cover shot by Neils himself.

“One of the ﬁrst shirts we made were those
MostDope tees, and we would just throw those
out at Mac’s shows,” Niels said. “After he blew

up that summer, we printed a bunch more to
get them out there.”

' Those original T—shirts, a reimagining of
the “Do The Right Thing” movie poster, exist

in limited quantities and mark a turning point
for Niels and his vision for his brand.

Daily Bread is a company steeped in that
sense of authenticity, and its new store is atesta—

t0 streetwear

ment to the company’s local roots. Aside from if ,

the brand’s signature collection, customers
can ﬁnd local lines, including Streetheart and
Vmaqlr, on the store’s shelves.
“We just try to show love to all the brands
coming up out here,” Niels said. V
Daily Bread has appeared at a time in

which street culture grows louder and louder”

in Pittsburgh and more local designers strive to
carve out a portion of the coastally dominated
streetwear industry for the steel city. '

But Pittsburgh’s clothing lines aren’t just
emulating their coastal counterparts.

“Pittsburgh is our perspective. Every hill and
valley is a different neighborhood with its own
character, which is what makes this city great.
There is a little something for everyone. Our
clothing takes that philosophy and combines
it with the idea of what it means to be creative

in our times,” Vmaqlr owner Peter Sorek said: I V
Part of Pittsburgh’s distinct perspecﬁve is the '1" l

marriage between street culture and art. The
Daily Bread store shares its space with 54/50,
an antique ﬁirniture gallery that reappropriates
antique furniture into modern designs. ’

“Our buddy Nico collects midcentury mod-

’ em furniture and does basically what I do with

streetwear with furniture,” Niels said.

For many book lovers, the beginning of
the fall semester is a time to wave good-
bye to those blissful summer afternoons
spent lounging in the sunlight with an
engaging book in one hand and a cool
drink in the other.

When juggling the stress of classes,
clubs, work and play, it’s difficult to ﬁnd
the time or the energy necessary to make
sense of Faulkner’s lengthy accounts of

‘ the people residing in Yoknapatawphal
A County. Hell, even something as readily

digestible as a Raymond Chandler¢nov—

el can become a tedious exercise when
you’Vejust finished slogging through 50
pages of David Hume or if there’s a lab
report pending. '

This creates a downwardlspiral of l

sorts: Those of us who rely on reading
as a much-needed escape from the anxi-
eties ofvcollege life are often too tired to
read, leaving us even more stressed and
exhausted than ever. Before turning to a
Netﬂix binge as an alternative, however,
students should consider giving comics
a try. ‘ '‘

It’s easy to scoff at the suggestion. ‘

Over the past several decades, comics
have been viewed as a medium fit primar-

P ily for two groups: children and geeky,

twenty—sided-dice wielding, LARP-happy

man—chil'dren. Setting aside our societal V

tendency to take shots at that which is
sometimes referred to as “geek culture,”
there are dozens of comics out there that
offer all the nuances and rich character-
ization of an engaging novel, and not all

. of them involve spandex suits.

Take Sean Phillips’ and Ed Brubaker’s
“Criminal”°series of comics. Each chapter
focuses on the story of a single character
within a city’s seedy underworld as he or
she seekswealth, vengeance or simply
to stay alive, often at the cost of others.
The stories_are steeped in the traditions
of classic crime novels, and the charac-
ters are nearly as appealing as they are
despicable. It’s suspenseful, gripping and
pulpy, without a superpower in sight. Best

. of all, because each story takes about a

half hourto read, it isn’t the same sort of
heavy commitment as a 20o—page novel.
There are dozens more comics that

bring different kinds of perspectives and

approaches to the genre.
The “Scott Pilgrim” series, drawn
and.written by Bryan Lee O’Malley, is

‘ fundamentally a love story with a hilari-

ous, arcade game—based twist. “Y: The

Vaughan, imagines a world in which all;
but one of the world’s men have9beevn :
wiped out. The creators use this prem-
ise as ajumping—off point for a sweep-
ing journey across the globe that often
turns gender norms on their head and
approaches our own culture’s_ gender dis-
parities without any traces of preachi-
ness. ,

Other series, such as Brian Wood’s
“DMZ,” approach the escalating ten-
sions between a cohesive surveillance
state and libertarian fanaticism in a way
that admonishes the radicalism of both

"philosophies.

Comic book culture is not without

its flaws, of course. Thanks to the me-

dium’s historically male readership, one
is hard-pressed to find a nuanced female
protagonist or even a woman drawn with
anatomical accuracy in most-of the more

' popular monthly and weekly comics. “Y:

The Last Man,” for example, focuses on
the single man on earth and not the more
than 3 billion women surrounding him.
Additionally, extreme violence is to be
expected on a scale that even the trashiest

‘horror movies sometimes fail to match.

There is also still aglut of supernatural ‘
and superhero themes, making the genre
optionsfairly limited when compared to
fiction or ﬁlm. This is partially because of
the fairly limited audience and partially _
because of the’ traditions of the genre.
All of the drama of a comic is usually
wrapped in these conventional formulas

involving heroes and villains with other-
worldly abilities, making it difficultto
find a comic book equivalent of “Anna
Karenina.”

That’s not to say .there aren’t com-
ics that defy all of the aforementioned
stereotypes. _ -_

The award-winning “Persepolis” by
Marjane Satrapi is a captivating mem-
oir about growing up during the Iranian

‘ Revolution and subsequent Iran-Iraq

War. The extremely funny memoirist and
novelist-Jonathqan Ames teamed up with
artist Dean Haspiel to create a graphic
novel that documented his struggles with
alcoholism in a way that was far more

. tragic than any of the stories he has ever

written. While it takes some digging, it
is possible to find alluring comics that

leave many of the medium’s perceived.

issues behind. ‘ -

If nothing else, it’s a medium that
deserves a chance. Its limits are being
tested almost constantly by writers such
as Brubaker, Wood and Vaughan, and the

‘ use of beautiful.visuals and clever dia-

logue make the best written comics less

. work and often more fun than a popular

novel. Issues of racism, gender, class and
religion are approached in a way‘ that,
if not always tactful, can be shockingly
complex to a new reader. . —

And even if the medium still doesn’t
have the diversity of voices it needs to
appeal to you, it probably beats studying.

For University of Pittsburgh Stages, a change in name, not values

John Lavanga
A€9"E Editor

The University of Pittsburgh Repertory Theater
has developed a knack for putting on plays that

a pose a challenge to all involved — audience
included. So it is no surprise that this semester’s
lineup is aimed at keeping this run of evocative
plays going, though possibly under a different
name.

According to marketing coordinatorjosh
Storey, Pitt Repertory'Theater will undergo a
name change this year, adopting the moniker
“University of Pittsburgh Stages,” a name he
feels represents “the act of constant change
that the act of crafting and performance brings
about.”

Apart from this change in title, Pitt Stages
has made few changes to its overall focus and
will continue its practice of holding one main-
stage performance, the play “Venus”written by
Suzan—Lori Parks and directed by Pitt professor
Cynthia Croot, and three student labs: “Ashes
to Ashes” by Harold Pinter, “The Mustache”,
by Sabina Berman and “Machinal” by Sophie
Treadwell. .

Each of the plays selected for the season
carries elements that seem certain to inspire
conversation. Parks’ “Venus,” which was se-
lected by Croot because of the way it explores

Pl1T ARTS develops lasting "bond with Pittsburgh’s Art Scene

John Lavanga
A€9"E Editor

When Maggie Wayne, a senior at Pitt ma-
joring in business, started attending Pitt
Arts events, her reaction to the program’s
offerings was one that has become fairly
;.standard. ~
 “I honestly can’t believe that we have
it here at Pitt,” Wayne said, expressing
‘her surprise at a program she sometimes
‘feels is too good to be true. As a student
with a love of theater, the prospect of
‘attending shows for free was too good
to pass up.

 Whether it’s because of the free meals,
 tickets to local arts events or the
"cﬂonvenientytransportation, Pitt Arts has

been an unsurprisingly popular program .

« among Pitt students since its inception.
As it turns out, however, the program
isn’t only beloved by the students raking
in all the perks.

According to Michael Bielski, the
senior vice president and chief operat-
ing officer of the Pittsburgh Symphony
‘Orchestra, PITT Arts is more than just
 boon for’ students looking to get Off

- _ “It’s a relationship that has developed

. between all of Pitt and the cultural dis-

  
    

trict,” Bielski said. During histenure at

the PS0, Bielski has worked closely with

Pitt Arts,~fostering this relationship. V‘
Bielski has been especially pleased

with the way Pitt Arts brings a diverse

crowd to PS0 per-

the departmental patchwork that can
develop elsewhere. ‘
That direct line of communication has
allowed for a number of special programs
to be organized within‘ the cultural dis~

trict, including‘

the PSO’s creation

formances. Though
orchestras’ often
have a reputation
for drawing an older,
more afﬂuent crowd,
according to Bielski,
“so many different
types of students
end up ,coming to
[the] concerts.” He
added that because ~
of the turnout, ’he’s
“beginning to be— , ,.
lieve that there’s ' 
not a prejudice out . A

tering speciﬁcally

on October 4.
Though Pitt

than a hundred
arts eventsoon an
annual basis‘, this
year presents a
number of dis-
tinct opportuni-
ties for students
looking to engage

in Pittsburgh’s_

events such as the

_ orchestra.

The only complaint Bielski has with
Pitt Arts, it seems, is that other universi-
ties in the region won’t adopt a similar
program. The fact that the organization
allows cultural groups to work with a
singlegoffice at the University of Pitts-
burgh simpliﬁes communications and
allows for far better relationships than

now—thriving arts
scene.

The Carnegie Museum -of Arts’ 2013
Carnegie International exhibition will
feature work from artists around the
world, as well as lectures from a hand-
ful of the artists themselves. According to
Pitt Arts director~Annabelle Clippinger,
Pitt students will have the opportunity to
attend these artist talks and get involved.

Arts offers more

In addition, Pitt Arts has opted to r

extend its Artful Wednesdays program,
which includes a performance and free
‘ lunch during the fall semester, into a
full—year program and will debut a Pitt
Arts festival this fall. Expanding the
programhas been a goal for some time,

and Pitt Arts’ recent move from the Of- T
ﬁce ofthe Provost to the Division of Stu—‘

dent Affairs allowed them to achieve this
aspiration.“People love Artful Wednes-
days so much,” Clippinger said. V

The Pitt Arts festival, which will run
from noon to 5:30 p.m. on September 6,
will be held on the porch of the William
Pitt Union and will include live music
from local artists as well as activities
such as a photo booth. Clippinger views
the festival as a way to introduce students

to the program in a way that is more ac— L

cessible than simply tabling in one of the
campus buildings.

While this year’s crop of Pitt Arts at-
tendees will likely see the events as a
way to unwind, Bielski believes that the
interest in the arts that these students
exhibit will give them more than just a
way to relax.

“I think that’s a part of education that

.you'can’t teach,” he said. E

suit of a better life. After arriving, she was put
on display around Europe in a freak show as
well as in museums.

It is a play that, as Croot wrote in an email,
“is a study in what happens when aperson stops
being ‘a person’ in the eyes of others, when
personal interactions become commodiﬁed
and when we lose our moral compass.”

The play, which will be put on between Oct.
24 and Nov. 10, will be staged in the Studio The-
ater, and Croot looks forward to utilizing the
“intimate and just abitforeboding” atmosphere
to make audiences feel asthough they are ob-
servers of exhibitions similar to those which

August 20, 2013 1 The Pitt News I \/vvvvv,pittnevvs.oom

featured Sarah Baartman.

Croot hopes that audiences will walk away
with the understanding that “without compas-
sion, none of us are human.” -

The student labs won’t shy away from con—
troversy either. Between Oct. 2 and 6, “Ashes to
Ashes” and “The Mustache” will both be staged
in the Henry Heymann Theatre. Though both

. plays’ conversations revolve around the discus-
sions between a man and awoman, they broach
rather disparate topics.

“Ashes to Ashes” will be directed by Peter

Woods, a Ph.D. studentwho has nearly3o years '

of experience in theater and has directed plays
in both academic and nonacademic theater.
Woods described the play as “ostensibly [a]
conversation between two people looking to

. get‘ married,” which cuts to cryptic images of

Nazi soldiers. According to Woods, These dark
undertones allow the playto examine “the re-
lationship we have to Violence.”

“The Mustache,” which will be directed by
Ph.D. student Christiana Molldrem Harkulich,
is a short play about the relationship between
an effeminate man and a masculine woman
who share a removable mustache. Harkulich

. wrote in an email that “the mustache becomes

a marker for the gendered roles that they play
within their own relationship as well as without
the larger social constructs,” resulting in a play-
ﬁil exploration of gender roles.

The ﬁnal student lab, “Machinal,” will also
be staged in the Henry Heymann Theaterfrom
Nov. 6 to 10. The play follows the life of Ruth

Enriquez, who brings theater experience from
Chicago and Cleveland, will direct the play, and
says that the sexism" she saw during the recent
election cycle inspired her to select it.

Enriquez sees value in the play’s portrayal of
Snyder as a woman who struggles to live up to
the traditional roles placed upon her “despite
her own feeling of being suffocated in these
roles.” Enriquez also seeks to utilize the theaters
three—fourths thrust layout in order to “enclose

to eclipse with our recent successes.

It’s not fair to call Pittsburgh a homoge-
neous place or a shell of a former. steel town.
There’s too much going on. And honestly,

comparing a city such as Pittsburgh to Lon?
don is difficult because of the difference in

scale. Great Britain’s capital has a population
of 8.1 million to Pittsburgh’s 307,000._ '
Still, there are some striking similarities

"between the two cities. Like London, Pitts-

burgh is rich in culture, and every neighbor-
hood is unique in and of itself’as'I’m sure
many of you have already discovered. But
in Pittsburgh, you’d be hard-pressed to ﬁnd
Squirrel Hill teeming with gothic youths‘ or
soccer—crazed fans or a Portuguese family
having a picnic next to an outdoor business
meeting on a random stretch of green space.
London is roughly one-third public park by
the way. ’
There’s something of a socioeconomic

‘wall dividing-and splicing Pittsburgh, as is

the case in many cities around the world.

‘ Across the pond, on both sides of the
Thames River, however, there’s a senseof
extreme, heterogeneity no matter what

. neighborhood you’re in, from the posh to

the dodgy (I saw. a man in a full-body1a—
tex suit with heels and a whip at a relatively

' conventional bar). 'It.’d be easier to attribute

London’s tourist industry to the ﬂooding
diversity‘, but I think it’s something deeper,
more entrenched. . if
rm not sure the best way to put it or the
best approach to seeing‘ it better realized
than in Pittsburgh. There are pockets of the
city I think resemble internationality very

well, just not with the same candor and cer-

emony as is the case in London. _

Joe Flint
IV! C T Campus

LOSWANGELES _ The“ combination of Al
jazeera and America doesn’t exactly sound
like a match made in Heaven, or jannah for

_ that matter.

But that’s not stopping the deep -pocketed

, media giant, funded by the government of ,
ll Qata:r,‘from spending hundreds of millions of
_.dollars to once ‘again try to build a presence

  the United States.

On Tuesday, Aljazeera launches Aljazeera

“America, an ambitious news network that

hopes to challenge CNN, Fox News and MS-

HNBC on their own turf. It has opened 12 bu-

reaus around the country and is hiring almost
1,000 /people, including several big-name
journalists, with promises of covering serious
national news here and a goal of becoming
part of the American landscape.

Persuading pay—TV distributors to carry Al -

Jazeera America and getting people to watch
it may be another story. There is ‘still bitter-
ness toward Aljazeera for providing an outlet
for Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks, a

‘move which led some to derisively label the
mnetwork “Jihad TV.”

“For many Americans, the perception is

these are the folks who brought you Osama

bin Laden,” said Allen Adamson, a managing

w ‘B!

partner of marketing ﬁrm Landor Associates.
“Even though they were providing a news

function, there was a case of don’t confuse ‘

me with the facts.” ‘

Since then, Aljaieera has won much praise
here for its in—depth coverage of the Middle
East and is considered avaluable source of
informationon the region.

“Aljazeera can cover the Arab world>.bet—
ter than any U.S. network by far,” said Chris
Harper, a professor at Temple University’s
School of Communications and aformer for-
eign correspondent for ABC News.

That doesn’t mean Harper and others still
don’t see a slant to its coverage. ,

“Al Jazeera has its point of view and that
includes a pro-Palestinian bias and to a certain
extent an anti-American bias,”-Harper said,
adding that this does not bother him because,

“I rather like that I don’t have to ﬁgure out

where they stand.”

About 48 ‘million people, or less than half '

of the nation’s 103 million pay—TV subscribers,
will be able to watch Aljazeera America when
it goes, live on Tuesday. ' -

Aljazeera was only able to get that much
penetration for its new channel by shelling out
$500 million last year to_ buy Current TV, the
news—talk network that was co —founded by Al
Gore, and use it_ as a platform for Aljazeera
America. With the purchase, Aljazeera inher-
ited Current TV’s existing distribution deals.

Not everyone -is on board, though. Time

co-u.bi.:él.e)u a.ppQ5.ing/'i1o«  

Warner Cable, which is the biggest pay—TV

provider in Los Angeles, opted to drop the _

channel after the sale was announced rather
than carry Aljazeera America. The cable op-
erator and Aljazeera America say they are in
active discussions regarding a distribution
agreement. _
Ehab Al Shihabi, a senior Aljazeera execu-
tive and acting chief executive of Al jazeera
America, said in a recent interview that there
is a “bucket of resistance” among some dis-
tributors to carrying the network, but overall
preconceived notions are changing for the
better. '
- “We’re going to demonstrate a demand,”
he said. ' i -
’ Wooing prominent American journalists
to work for Aljazeera has not been a problem.

Familiar faces that have signed up for duty -
include former CNN anchor Soledad O’Brien, ’
.ex—CBS News reporters Sheila MacVicar and

joie Chen andformer NBC News anchorjohn
Seigenthaler. »
Behind the scenes, several well-regarded

broadcast and cable news executives have _

been tapped for signiﬁcant roles as well‘. Kate
O’Brian, who spent three decades in senior
production roles at ABC News, will serve as
Aljazeera America’s ﬁrst president. Also _on-
board are David Doss and Marcy McGinniss,
who have held senior positions at CNN and
CBS, respectively.

“They are putting together a strong team,”

said David Westin, a media advisor and former ‘C
president of ABC News.

This is Al]azeera’s second attempt at trying
to crack the U.S. market. In 2006, it launched
Aljazeera English, an English—language ver-
sion of its ﬂagship channel.

However, thenetwork struggled to get
distribution outside of New York and Wash—*'
ington, D.C., and ended up primarily as aWeb
service, which has a small but loyal audience.

Aljazeera is expected to take down the live

stream of Aljazeera English after Aljazeera
America launches, although the network de-
clined officially to comment on its fate.
Rather than focus on the Middle East,
which is its wheelhouse, Aljazeera Amer-
ica made the decision to provide in—depth
coverage of America that it says other news
channels have abandoned. It has opened bu-
reaus not only in media hot spots New York,
Washington and Los Angeles, but also Detroit,“
New Orleans and Nashville. Headquarters will

. be in New York City with studios near Penn

Station, although its ﬂagship show “America
Tonight,” anchored by Chen, will be done out
of Washington, D.C., where Aljazeera America
has leased space at the Newseum, a museum
devoted to journalism. _

Harper questionedthat strategy.

“Al Jazeera is a go-to place when things
happen in the Middle East,” he said._“I’m not
sure Aljazeera America will be a go—to place
to ﬁnd things out about the United States.” J

After more than a year of organization, preparation and, of course, knitting, “Knit the Bridge”'— the initiative led
by the Fiberarts Guild of Pittsburgh to cover the Andy Warhol bridge in hand knitted blankets ~—- culminated on the
weekend of Aug. 1oand 11 with the installation of 580 panels. The project, which was made possible by the efforts of
1,800 participants, was created as an homage to the city’s increasingly vibrant art culture, as well as its status as the
city of bridges. ' ' ‘ . *

Though Knit the Bridge is certainly a jarring sight to see, yarn bombing has gained traction as graﬂiti’s lighthearted
younger sibling. Yarn bombing provides, artists with a way to pu 7a creative spin on a location without doing permanent.
damage. The bridge’s colorful array of tlfousands of feet of yarn is easily one of the largest yarn bombing projects to date.

Pitt’s defense returns 10 starters
from a unit that ﬁnished No. 17 in
the nation at 330 yards allowed per
game. It’s a defense that should
prove to be the strength of the Pan-
thers during their inaugural season

against Atlantic Coast Conference
competition.

Work is still in progress, how-
ever, for the offense of this 2013
edition of Panther football. Head

/coach Paul Chryst helped build of-
“ '‘ ensive powerhouses at Wisconsin
that featured dominant rushing at-
tacks, and his second year with the
program should help the offense
take further steps toward becom-
ing the unit he envisions it can be.
“We’re certainly more comfort-

‘ able,” Chryst said. “Obviously it’s

great to get back out here, and we
appreciate the work the guys put
1n.” .
While the players put in the
rgvork, Chryst needs to ﬁnd answers
at multiple slots in Pitt’s offensive
unit. »
Quarterback
Much has been made of the
quarterback battle, as Pitt needs
to ﬁnd a replacement for three—year
starter Tino Sunseri, who .threw
for 3,288 yards and 21 touchdowns
against just three interceptions last
season.
_ Redshirt senior Tom Savage is
the likely favorite because he enters
égdamp with the most experience.
Chad Voytik will vie for the posi-
tion after redshirting last season,
when he stepped on campus as a
highly touted quarterback in the
class of 2012.
“We want to see command of

lathe offense,” Chryst said about the A

quarterback competition. “While
you’re doing that, you’ve got to feel
comfortable with the offense and
transition that to consistent play.”
Savage ran the scout team of-
.;£_ense last season and impressed
‘ many around the program. He was
the offensive player of the year his
freshman year at Rutgers, but
transferred to Arizona for personal
reasons. _
Now in Pittsburgh and eligible
see time on the turf at Heinz
Field, Savage is solely focused on
the day in front of him.
“[Chryst] hasn’t'told me any-

thing, and I don’t think he haste,”
Savage said. “We go out there and
play football, and he decides what
goes.” "

On the other hand, Voytik does
not carry the "same experience as
Savage. But he did put onan im-
pressive show in Pitt’s Blue-Gold
spring game. Voytik completed 27

of 33 passes for 358 yards and three ,

touchdowns.

“This offense is tough, and that
[redshirt] year has helped me,”
Voytik said. “In the spring, I came
in with conﬁdence, and I thought it
showed. Hopefully it’ll carry over.”

Running Back

Pitt’s backﬁeld appeared to be
set in stone after 2012, with Rushel
Shell primed to assume the lead-

open. I

Pitt returns a group of backs

that rushed for 191 yards on 41 ‘

carries in 2012, and junior Isaac
Bennet might be the favorite af-
ter taking 29 of those carries last

, season.

“He’s working, and I like his ap-
proach,” Chryst said about Bennett.
New faces might also spring up
in addition to Bennett’s and red-
shirt sophomore Malcolm Crock-
ett’s, such as Desmond‘ Brown,
James Conner and Barn Bradley.
“We’re working on getting guys
reps to see what they can do,”
Chryst said. ‘
Wide Receiver ' -
Pitt lost two of its three lead-
ing receivers from 2012 when Mike
Shanahan and Cam Saddler
‘ graduated. In 2013, redshirt se-
nior Devin Street enters the season
28 receptions away from setting the
school record for career catches
and is the unquestioned leader of
the receiving corps. _
“It’s weird seeing guys go,”
Street said. “I’m just trying to be
here for guys. Whatever they have,

oltz (#86) will nee to step up 5 it Ink fr nwer at

  

they can come to me. I’m just trying
to help everyone.” .

But behind Street, positions at
receiver are up for grabs. Junior
Ronaldjones, one player expected
to step up, is suspended for the
season.

That leaves veterans such as
redshirt senior Ed Tinker and red-
shirt junior Kevin Weatherspoon
likely to see reps on the outside.
Tinker caught ﬁve passes for 68
yards and a score last season while
Weatherspoon played in just four
games.

“I have been thinking about it
the whole summer,” Weatherspoon
said about the opportunities avail-
able. “I just want to help the team
out in any way I can.”

While the rest of the receivers
compete for time, Chryst has a solid
foundation in Street from which he
can build the receiving corps.

“Certainly Devin is going to be
one of those guys we need to play at

inconsistencies, with wins over
ranked opponents such as Vir-

Separating the hoopla from reality as Pitt begins ACCp|ay

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff Writer

Amid a summer of excitement surrounding ’

the inaugural ACC football season that is
quickly approaching, the players are hard
at work preparing their on-ﬁeld product

‘ in the South Side for the Sept. 2 showdown

with Florida State.
While all the marketing campaigns to sell
out Heinz Field carry into the ﬁnal push,

there is no, better time than now to diag- -

nose whether or not anything willactually
change on the ﬁeld and what differences

those changes may bring. 4
Here is your guide to seperate the hoopla ,

from reality and to ﬁnd out if these Panthers
will win more games than lastyear.

Quarterback 2 P

The most notable change for Panther fans
will be at quarterback. Former quarterback
Tino Sunseri’s collegiatecareer ended fol-
lowing last season and his graduation has
presumably opened the door for ﬁfth-year
transfer Tom Savage to guide the team.

A 6-foot~5 quarterback, Savage will re-
semble Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlis-
berger in more ways than just a big frame.
He also wears the number seven and has a
similar playing style, which Panthers receiv-
ers are enjoying thus far in camp.

“Tommy’s great, just seeing the ball come
out,” said senior wide receiver Devin Street.
“We have to get that syncopation, but I think
he’s the real deal. Going into the season, once
he gets comfortable, he’s going to be good.”

Paul Chryst announced in the seconzé
week of training camp that Savage earned
the starting job, where he will serve as an
upgrade at quarterback. His ability to get
the ball down ﬁeld and ﬁt throws in tight
spaces with this strong arm will be an asset
in head coach Paul Chryst’s offense.

Tight End ,

Though sophomore_].P. Holtz returns to
start forthe second season in a row, the tight
end position has been signiﬁcantly upgraded
since the Panthers last played.

The addition of Wisconsin transfer
Manasseh Garner and true freshman Scott
Orndoff will certainly allow offensive co-
ordinator Joe Rudolph to get creative and
create matchup problems against slower
linebackers or smaller defensive backs.

Chryst alluded to the speciﬁc use of Gar-
ner in goal-to—go situations during a post-
practice interview with local media.

.‘fWhoever isplaying for us will hopefully
be a threat, but Manasseh is one of those

Pitt men’s soccer plans to rebound
from a.disappointing conference record
last year as the team takes on some of the
toughest college soccer programs in the
country in the ACC. 7

Pitt played a challenging conference
schedule last season and looks to take
that experience into this season. Coach
Joe Luxbacher is confident his team will
be able to compete in what has been rated
one of the top soccer conferences in the

country.

“We have a good group of men return-
ing, a solid and talented incoming group
to improve our talent where needed,” Lux-

bacher said. “The group effort-will be what-
ultimately translatesjour efforts into.-the‘

on-ﬁeld success we are aiming to achieve.”

Returning starters John Cordier and _
Nick Wysong should contribute to that
success. Cordier is a co-captain~and‘hard-

working defender, while Wysonglead the
Panthers in points last season with 13.
With added leadership and incoming
talent, look for the Panthers to improve
their record from last season and prove
themselves as one of the up—and—coming
programs in the ACC. '

Wotherspoon passes on pro ranks, returns to lead Pitt

Sam Boj arski
Staﬁ Wrz‘ter

Last month, second—team All—Big East pitcher
Matt Wotherspoon made the difﬁcult decision
to forego the opportunity to play professional
baseball and, instead, will return to Pitt for the
2014 season.

But the right—hander, who led the Panthers
in strikeouts with 85 last season, doesn’t have
one foot out the door just yet. Although he has
received the attention of major league scouts
since high school, he remains “truly a team
guy,” in the words of Mark Modrovsky, who
was Wotherspoon’s coach at Crestwood High
School in Mountain Top, Pa. - 

Forget the individual stats — 190 career
strikeouts and 17 wins ~— which rank him sixth
and seventh all-time among Pitt pitchers, re-
spectively. Forget the ﬁve complete games in
three years. 1

“It was more important to me last season
that we had the most wins in Pitt history,”
Wotherspoon said. “That’s something special
that I will hold onto the rest of my life, more ’
than my individual stats.”

The Detroit Tigers selected Wotherspoon
as the 606th overall choice in the 20th round

teammates Elvin Soto and Ethan Mildren, he
became part of one ofthe largest draft classes in
school history, only comparable to 2011, when
three Panthers were drafted by MLB teams. _
But Wotherspoon has no apparent regrets
about returning for another year at Pitt. A
“I love it at Pitt,” Wotherspoon said. “I love
our coaching stafﬁ I love the guys on our team,
and having an opportunity to pitch in the ACC

is pretty special.”

Head coach Joe Jordano will return two of

A his three main starters from last year, includ-

ing senior right—hander Rhys Aldenhoven, who
recorded an impressive 8-1 record last season

and will join Wotherspoon on the three-man -

weekend rotation. . ‘ ,
Jordano is especially thrilled to have the
durable Wotherspoon back. »
“Matt is an extremely hard worker who has
a great passion for not only the University, but
our program,”]ordano said. ' ’ A
Wotherspoon’s three years. of experience
pitching in the Big East, along with his ability
to pitch late into games,, make him a likely-
candidate for ace of the staff. ‘
Wotherspoon can get it done with the fast-
ball, which often clocks in the 91 to 94 mph
range, but he has also developed a nasty slider
and a plus brea_king ball while at Pitt. Add the
changeup into the mix, and that makes four

, solid pitches — not to mention he doesn’t tire ‘
. after sixjnnings like some starting pitchers.

Wothersppon ranks‘ sixth all-time in innings‘

effort delivery, which is a rare combination,”
Modrovsky said. “Matt has developed into a

Wotherspoon and Modrovsky have grown
quite close in the years since Wotherspoon
graduated high school. They have gone ﬁsh-

ing together regularly, and when he’s home
for breaks, Wotherspoon often sees his old '

coach more frequently than some of his high

' “It’s great to have someone like that, who‘ ‘

kind of went through the same thing and has

helped guide me along the way,” Wother- ‘
spoon said. “I can’t say enough about coach-

over the past couple of years.”

* Modrovsky has maintained close contact 1;
with Wotherspoon and was able to watch him "
tie his season high in strikeouts in a-win over A
‘ Villanova last season. A score of people from

back home joined Modrovsky at Charles ‘L.

Cost Field that day to watch Wotherspoon pitch . '

- six strong innings while leading his team to a _

12-4 victory.

“Matt Wotherspoon is very easy to root for.

Cape Cod League keeping Pitt players sharp over summer

Ryan Bertonaschi '
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

Months after its winningest season in program
history, the‘Pitt’s baseball team is showing
signs of more to come. '

Eight members of the 2013 teamare repre-
sented in various summer leagues across the
country. Three of the players — outﬁelder Boo
Vazquez, pitcherjon Danielczyk and pitcher
Joe Harvey — are 40 games deep in the Cadil-

lac of North American summerbaseball — The 1

Cape Cod League.

’ The CCBL’s reputation is no ﬂuke. One—in—
six current major league players experienced
summers on the brisk, Massachusetts penin-
sula in hopes of exposing themselvesto elite
competition and major league scouts.

Vazquez has exposed himself to both.
Vazquez hit .337 for the Panthers this spring
with a .871 OPS 54 games.

But, despite playing 54 games, Vazquez
started just 48 and ﬁgures to anchor the mid-
dle of the 2014 Panther lineup. When Vazquez

batted cleanup in 2013, the Panthers went .

24-8. .
“It’s the best league I’ve played in. Every
night you’re facing a very good pitcher, and
on the opposing team, the position players

are Very skilled on defense as well as at the 1

plate,” Vazquez said. “I met scouts from the

Marlins, Yankees, Brewers and Red Sox, just
to name a few.” 1

ceive from scouts and their demonstration of

“These are the best Division I players in the

park and watching games,” saidjen McCaffrey,
sports reporter for the Cape Cod Times. “You
see the guys here on the cape, and then three
years later, they’re in the high-level minor
leagues. The talent level is pretty amazing.”

McCaffrey has seen it all. She regularly
checks in with scouts, and she knows what
they study within pitchers and hitters .’ As for
pitching, Mccaffrey sees a direct correlation

putting up bigpower numbers. [They look for] ‘

guys with consistent fastball command, guys
who can mix in their off—speed pitches and who.
can keep hitters off balance,” McCaffrey said.

The league tests players in many ways.
Probably the biggest test of them all deals
with the transition from metal to Wooden bats,
on both sides of the ﬁeld.

Danielczyk is one of the pitchers testing
this transition, and he will become a key com-
ponent of the 2014 Pitt bullpen after he posted

a 1.69 ERA in 22 appearances in 2013.

“[Batting] with wooden bats, you can al-
ways tell if a ball has been hit well. As a pitcher,
it’s pretty much the same,” Danielczyk said.

Vazquez furthered Danielczyk’s notion,
but also pointed out that metal bats are much
more forgiving.

“Being more patient with Wood bats is im-
portant because you can’t get away with as
much using wood bats,” Vazquez said. “You
have to be more selective with the pitches
you swing at to make sure it’s a ball you can
hit hard.” ' .

Vazquez has adapted relatively quickly.
His .328 batting average earned himself a
starting position for the Eastern Division in
the Cape Cod League All—Star Game. In the
game, Vazquez went 0-for-2 with one walk
and scored a run in a 9-3 rout of the Western
Division. .

The Panther slugger would probably post
a notably better season batting averageif he
were not asked to bunt several times, Accord-
ing to McCaffrey, however, a player’s willing-
ness to sacriﬁce for the team is what impresses
scouts the most, especially among cleanup
hitters.

“Scouts aren’t always looking for the power

hits, but the situational play, not trying to a

show off too much, but trying to help the team
win. Those are the things that stick out, not
just the ﬂashy numbers, but how they carry
themselves, their maturity,” McCaffrey said.

Personal adversity is another area she ad-
dressed. Each player in the 1o—team league is
either living on his own in unfamiliar territory
or living under the roof of a host family. An
overwhelming majority of players must work
day jobs to support aliving and afford weekly
courtesy rents to their host families.

Players are reimbursed if they must travel
to Massachusetts by plane and are sometimes
given gas money for transportation to and
from games. Other than that they are not re-
warded a dime by the volunteer—run, nonproﬁt
organization.

Moreover, NCAA baseball teams play

\

games scattered through a weekend—heavy
schedule, while games in the Cape Cod League
are played on a daily basis.

“They’re playing here in the league with a
44-game schedule,” Mccaffrey said. “They’re
playing every single day.” .

“We have playoffs, so I could be here an-
other week,” Danielczyk said.

Harvey’s team, the Hyannis Harbor Hawks-,
is in a ﬁerce battle for the Western Division’s
No. 1,se'ed with the Falmouth Commodores.
Harvey has thrown six innings in three ap-
pearances and owns a 1.50 ERA with seven
strikeouts.

No matter who is in the championship se-
ries, the limited ﬁeld—side bleachers are sure

Pitt’s distance runners are ready to leave a mark in ACC

Megan Boyle

Before the city of Pittsburgh is fully awake
and students start to stumble to their
8 a.m. classes, a group of students run

through campus, taking advantage of the '

early morning calm. These students, who
have often been called crazy for their en-
d avors, are the Pitt cross country team.
Last season, the Panthers’ women’s
cohtingent had two first-place ﬁnishes,
two second-place finishes and a sixth-
place finish in the Eastern College Ath-
letic Conference championship. The Pan-
t fgrs accomplished these feats with only
 upperclassrnen leading the team,
relying heavily on the younger members
of the team to their success.

Now that these young members have
gained experience, they plan to take the
Atlantic Coast Conference by storm‘. ,

’ “We want to make an impact at the ACC
championships. The Big East is a really
good conference in distance running, but
I think the ACC will be even more com-
p:§ﬁtive,” sophomore Rachel Brown said.
’ _Brown made her ﬁrst appearance as a
 ther last season during the Duquesne
Duals, running a 19:04 and squeezing

 

into a top-10 ﬁnish. The then—freshman
ran consistently throughout the season,
even leading the Panthers to a ﬁrst—place
ﬁnish in the Paul Short Invitational at
Lehigh University.

But Brown isn’t the only Panther who
is excited for this new transition.

“It’s new territory for us,” head coach '
Alonzo Webb said. “We have a fairly young .

team on both sides, but based on last year,
I think we’re going to be competitive.”
Given the new competition, the girls
are willing to train harder than ever to
make sure that they are prepared this
season. I
“We start with lower mileage and then
slowly increase it as we get closer to the
season. Most girls are averaging.7o-75

. miles a week,” Brown said in regard to
- their training in the off season. '

“Our training this summer has been
intense  what we’re doing now will deﬁ-
nitely pay off in the ACC and in the long
run,” junior Morgan Perry said.

Perry, who is now one of the few up-
perclassmen on the team, will be expected
to perform as well as she did last season.

“Morgan Perry was a leaderever since‘
her freshman year,”'Webb said. “She’s
going to be a catalyst for everything. The

team is really going to rally around her
this season.”

The junior placed ﬁrst at the Cappy An-
derson Invitational last year with a time
of 18:30:50. Also her time of 19:04:05
landed her the 17th spot in the Eastern
College Athletic Conference champion-

ship — an impressive feat, considering A

that more than 100 runners competed.

.,A new conference isn’t the only change _

within the cross country team, as the Pan-
thers have two newassistant coaches this
season: Jim Lear and Adam Bray.

“I looked at his resume, and I said,
‘This is a guy who’s going to be huge for
us in terms of leading this program,”’
Webb said of Lear. Both Lear and Bray will
coach both Panther squads this season.

- Unlike the women’s team, the men’s
cross country team will look to its older ,

‘ members for momentum this season. De-

spite losing four runners to graduation,

» the team has four returning upperclass-

men, including the junior-senior duo of
Rich Addison and Ben Kisley leading the

'. pack.

Last season, Kisley placed second at
the Cappy Anderson Invitational and ran
a season—best at the Paul Short Invita-
tional, running an 8km in 26:02. I

orévoiw

.,.

After those races, a stress-fracture in-
jury in his right foot cut his season short,
but now that he’s healed, Kisley is eager
to return to the competition.

“I want to show everyone what my true
capabilities are. I really want to [break
my personal record] by a lot this year,”
Kisley said. ‘

Addison, who closely trailed Kisley,"

ran similar times all last season. He
wasn’t far behind Kisley in the Cappy
Anderson invitational, with a third—place
finish and a time of 26:30.

The duo is a pair to watch in competi-
tion, but both men are eager to propel
the team forward. 0

Webb expects Kisley, as a senior mem-
ber of the team, to assume a leadership
position to his 10-member squad.

But don’t let numbers fool you.

“I expect our kids to compete at a high
level. When we go into: the ACC, we’re
going to be a competitive team,” Webb
said. “They’re going to try and prove
themselves and say that ‘we belong in
this conference.”’

' Kisley once received a word of advice
that he is now passing down to the team,
and it is quite simple: Keep running. I

In a year when the Pitt football team’s head
coaching position is not the biggest sto-
ryline, the team’s group of fresh faces will
provideg a boost that not many people saw
coming. C _

The incoming recruiting class, which in— Q
cludes many members who could contribute
signiﬁcant time, is a creating a buzz around
training camp as Pitt ofﬁcially opened its

August 20, 2018 i The Pitt News J vw\AN.pittrievvs_oom

inaugural season in the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference with the start of training camp on
Aug. 6_. '

Leading the way for those true freshmen
is an offensive lineman who is hard to miss:
Dorian Johnson from Belle Vernon High
School in southwestern Pennsylvania.

Standing at 6—foot—6,Johnson is labeled

as the can’t-miss prospect in this year’s re- .

cruiting class, but coach Paul Chryst insisted
after day one of camp that no starting spot,
especially for a true freshman, is guaranteed.

“[The freshmen] looked like new guys,”
Chryst said. “A couple guys did a good job,
but there’s a lot being thrown at them, not
just what to do, but how we do it, where to
go from one drill to the nex .”

Chryst said that tweaking the schedule

,_ and getting into the routine of camp will ‘

help the team out, but he also said you can’t
generalize thestatus of the team’s youngest
members.

“As a group we have a long way to go, but

_ that’s to be expected,” he said.

Freshmen expected tocontribute immediately for Pitt 

Offensive line is a spot where depth might
allow no more than a few openings forJohn—
son and other newcomers to step in and
play right away. Johnson will compete with
redshirtjunior‘T.J. Clemmings and redshirt
seniorjuantez Hollins for the starting right

tackle spot.

“We’ve got to stay healthy there, but right
now we do have more,” Chryst said. “A lot
of them are young. We’re hoping to create
positions with competition, so we’ll see if
that holds true.”,

Fans might not see Johnson right away,
but a lack of depth at the wide receiver posi-
tion could push newcomer Tyler Boyd rilght
into the thick of ACC action. —

encouraging signs forPanthers fans on day

“You don’t know what to expect out of

Blewitt’s ﬁrst reps. “As someone new to the
group as a freshman, he probably felt more

, nervous than we" did. But he did well. He

looks the part as a kicker.”
Chryst stressed theimportance of not

I only the freshman, but all the players, main-

taining an approach to their speciﬁc position
and-everything they do on the field. V

“I love how our guys came out and phat-

.,3Eitt head coach Paul Chryst announced
ﬁlfter Wednesday’s morning practice that
Tom Savage has been named the team’s
starting quarterback, and Todd Thomas
rejoined the team.
 “Tom’s going to be our starting quar-
terback,”lChryst said. “We like what he has
,,done to this point, and it’s areflection of
where Tom’s at.”
Savage was the favorite to start Sept. 2

 

against Florida State because of his experi-

_ ence and big arm. A redshirt senior, Savage

transferred twice before landing at Pitt
following stints at Rutgers and Arizona.

Savage started for Rutgers in 2009
as a true freshman and was named the
team’s Most Valuable Offensive Player after
throwing for 2,211 yards and 14 touch-
downs. But Savage hasn’t played a game
since 2010 after sitting out in 2011 and
2012 because of NCAA guidelines.

As with nearly every sum-
mer, Pitt basketball players
dominated the Pittsburgh
Pro—Am summer league held
at the Greentree Sportsplex.
Nothing emphasized this
more than the ﬁnal contest

of the league, inwhich Talib

Zanna and James Robinson
led PGT Trucking to a 108'-
101 victory over Oliverio’s
Italian Style Peppers to
claim the league’s champi-
onship.

Zanna posted 37 points
and 16 rebounds in the fi-
nal game and took home
the league’s Most Valuable
Player distinction after he
led the league in scoring and
rebounding at 27.2 points

and 14.5 rebounds per game

":9. ~..~. .¢m~~r'1-vwn---""'a_1--< ..-a..w..:.w. :. V.“ ‘A1:

during the regular season.
SPK Law ﬁnished in a tie

for ﬁrst place in the regular

season and was led by Pitt

redshirt senior Lamar Pat-

terson,’ who averaged 22.7
points, 9.7 rebounds and
5.7 assists per game. Pitt’s
highest-proﬁle recruit, Mike
Young, played with Patter-
son and put up 15.8 points
and 6.8 rebounds per each
one of his ﬁve games played.

Young demonstrated his
ability to take over games
multiple times in the sum-
mer league and ﬂashed what
value he will bring_to Pitt in

the winter. But he kept his

goals simple ahead of 21 mon-

'umental season in the bas-

ketball program’s history.
“When I come out here, I
try to work on my motor, get

a lot of rebounds, and that’s’

about it,” Young said. »

-u_..-..._ .-

In addition, Mike Lecak
earned a chance to show
his improvements after he

redshirted in 2012-2013 as a .

walk—on, scoring 7.2 points

7 per league game.

For Lecak and Young, two

players who might be pushed 3

to contribute as freshmen,
playing with Patterson was
an experience that could
prove invaluable as Pitt be-
gins playing in the nation’s
toughest basketball confer-
ence. _

“I kind of consider myself
still new because last year I
redshirted ,so that’s why I
like playing with _Lamar be-
cause I do learnla lot every
game,” Lecak said. “Espe-
cially with Mike [Young], a
big-name recruit coming in
and everybody’s expecting
a lot, that’s the best person
to look toward, that’s a great

person to play with.”

Asfor Pitt’s younger play-
ers, fans caught a glimpse of
the future from the _UPMC-
sponsored team sponsored,
which included redshirt
sophomore Durand John-
son, and incoming fresh-
men Jamel Artis and Josh
Newkirk.

Newkirk scored 21.8
points per game to ﬁnish

. fourth among qualified lead-

ing scorers in the Pro-Am,
with the highlight of his
summer league coming July
1 when he scored 33 points.
N ewkirk showed an efﬁcient
offensive game that might
be called uponin reserve of
Robinson, as“ he shot 50.6
percent from the field and
50 percent from 3,-point
range. ‘
Newkirk’s performance
resulted in him being named

the league’s top freshman.

Alongside Newkirk,John—
son scored 21 points per
game in his three games on
37-percent shooting, and
Artis took strides to im-
prove his game with aver-
ages of 14.3 points and 6.8
rebounds per game.

For Artis,th'e experience
of the summer league was
valuable for him and his

teammates as they estab—-

lished a baseline of com-
fort with one another on
the ﬂoor.’ ‘ ’
“It’s very important.
We’re getting to know each

other a lot,” Artis said. “Get ‘

some experience against ‘col-
lege-level and athletes and
good players from overseas.
It’s a good experience.”

In addition, Artis’ goal

‘for the summer was to improve his phy-
sique as well as to adjust to the collegiate
game.

‘ “I’m losing weight and getting stron-

Artis said.  ' ’ >7
Next to summer workouts, the summer
league was the first step taken by Pitt
basketball toward its new era playing
 the ACC. Robinson, who replaces last

Overall, the experience of every Pitt

contributions are necessary across the

“Obviously I was excited,” Savage said.
“But I’d be a fool to take it any more than
that. Especially with what’s happened to
me in the past, I can’t become complacent
with it.” , '

While Savage earned the privilege of
starting against No. 13 Florida State in
Pitt’s ACC debut, Chryst cited the impor-
tance of Savage to continue improving as
training camp runs its course.

“I think [he can improve upon] his tim-
ing with the passing game,” Chryst said.
“Not just with the receivers, but with his
«own timing and when to stay with a par-
ticular guy and when to get off and work
through his progressions.”

Chryst said he informed Savage that
he would fill the starting position, leav-
ing Chad Voytik as Savage’s backup. Pitt
entered camp without a clear starter at
the position, with Voytik and Savage in
contention for the role.

“We still think that Chad has made re-
ally good progress,” Chryst said. “There
are a lot of opportunities to develop play-
ers in practice, and we’ve got to continue
with that.” ‘

While Savage is the starter this season,
Voytik will back him up and is the future
when it comes to who calls the signals for
Chryst next season after Savage graduates.
Both Chryst and offensive coordinator
Joe Rudolph cited the need to continue
to develop Voytik and also noted that the
decision hasn’t altered either quarter-
back’s attitude.

“I don’t think Chad will miss a beat
in his approach,” Rudolph said. “I don’t
expect him to relax one bit.”

Todd Thomas (#8) returned to the team after leaving the program. Pitt News ﬁle photo

    
 

The other big news of the day came '

on the defensive side, as redshirt junior
linebacker Todd Thomas returned to the
Panthers.

“He’s back on the team,” Chryst .said__,«
“That’s all I’m going to talk about there.”

Thomas informed the coaching staff
last week that he intended to leave the
program, but was at practice Wednesday.
He was not in pads but did participate in
some drills.

The return of the linebacker should
certainly bolster an already impressive
defense that returns 10-of—12 starters froni
last year’s unit, which ﬁnished No. 17 in‘
the nation at 330 yards allowed per game.

Thomas missed the first four games of
the 2012 season, but started seven of the
nine ﬁnal games. In those games, Thomas
registered 59 tackles, 1.5 sacks, ﬁve pass
breakups, one interception and blocked
a punt against Louisville, which he re-
covered in the end zone for a touchdown.

Thomas entered camp as the prohibi-
tive favorite to earn one of the starting
outside linebacker positions, but was
replaced on the first team by redshirt
freshman Mike Caprara. Chryst said the
tactic was designed to motivate Thomas,
but the following day Thomas informed
the coaching staff of his intent to leave
the program.

Since the decision, Thomas remained
in contact with Chryst, culminating in his
return to the team.

“I was able to talk to Todd every day ‘

and had continued discussions with him,”
Chryst said. 3

 ' ally simple,

  

The return of a few of last year’s key
contributors, coupled with the success of
off—season workouts, has Cordier excited
about this season’s team.

“We are better prepared this season
than last year,” Cordier said. “Hopefully
that preparation will translate to wins
on the field, and we can surprise some
people and silence some of the critics.”

And Pitt certainly needs to lean on that
preparation. The current ACC — includ-
ing Pitt, Syracuse ‘and Notre Dame -
features seven NCAA tournament teams
from last season, three top—10 teams in
the ﬁnal NSCAA coaches poll and five of

‘the last eight national champions. _
The Petersen Sports Complex and Am-
A brose Urbanic Field will host four NCAA

Tournament teains — Boston College,
University of North Carolina, Xavier and

Wake Forest — from last season, in addi- '
tion to former Big East rival Virginia Tech .

and two—time national runner—up ‘Duke’.

The biggest tests for the Panthers will
occur on the road this season, where Pitt
will visit six different opponents: 201:2
semiﬁnalist Maryland; former Big East
rivals Notre Dame and Syracuse and new

i I rivals North Carolina State, Virginia and

Clemson. 

This year’s ACC opponents were 126;
69-32 last season and boasted a combined
.646 winningpercentage. And while the
ACC is ranked as the No. 1 conference this
season, Luxbacher feelsthat the ACC is
not a bigger challenge. '

“To me the ACC is not a bigger chal-

’ A  . lenge,‘ but a similar challenge,” Luxbacher

said. .“Every_ gamelwill be a difﬁcult 
because every team in the ACC is a top

team, and there are no average‘ teams.” 4

And while the Big East enjoyed plenty

of soccer success, the ACC takes it to_ja/ '

new level. . g . ’ 
The ACC is home to ﬁve out of the last

. ‘ eight national. champions and consisfi.

tently features ranked teams. . 

As a result of the success, nine of the:
current 12 schools have stadiums with
capacities of more than 2,000 people,
and four schools have stadiums that can

fit more than 5,000 spectators, includ— -

In a little under a week, Pitt women’s soc-
cer kicks offa daunting 19~game season,
its inaugural campaign in the Atlantic
Coast Conference in which the Panthers
face eight opponents from last year’s top-
zié rankings. '

y ‘ But on a luminous Friday morning in
early August, the team gatheredgat the
Petersen Sports Complex for a much less
arduous event. The women’s on—fie1d fo-
cus was not their first ACC match against
Boston College on Sept. 12, nor their Sept.
 bout with reigning NCAA champ North
Carolina, nor their‘Root Sports televised
game at Duke on Oct. 27. T

_ Not yet ﬁxated on any matchup, the
Panthers took to Ambrose Urbanic‘ Field
for the team photo shoot and individual
player headshots.

g‘ Sure, team photo day is in no way
preparation forithe season. The atmo-
sphere will be much different on the turf
for Pitt’_s ﬁrst home game Aug. 30 against
Bucknell.

The environment will be raucous, and
the players will engage in fierce tackles

The pictures from this summer morn-

manent ﬁxture to identify a face for each
player’s name. And with a team that has
its incoming freshman outnumbering
.its 11 returning players by one-, estab-
lishing an identity is going to be key for
the Panthers on both the roster charts
and the ﬁeld.
That identity, according to second-
year head coach Greg Miller,‘ is built on an
unwavering effort, an unrelenting motor,
“We’re very hardworking,” Miller said. .
“We’re going to be competitive in every
outing, and regardless of whatever the
score line is, we’re going to compete to

in the offensive third and help maintain
possession, Miller said.

Junior defenderjackie Poucel does not
at all believe that the defense will falter
without Meier because of the leadership
and confidence present within the unit.
In particular, Poucel cited strengths in
senior center back — and co—captai~n —
Morgan Sharick as well as inredshirtju—
nior keeper Nicole D’Agostino. «

“[Sharick] has really helped me with
my game personally, not only tactically
and technically, but also with my confi-
dence level,” Poucel said. “Even ifI make
a mistake, she has my back all the time
and vice versa. We have a really good re—A
lationship back [on defense].”

Poucel issued similar votes of recip—t
rocating confidence for D’Agostino, who
started every game last year and finished,
fifth in the_Big East in save percentage at
73.1 percent.

The midfield nowfeatures the motor-
ing Meier, two veteran players in senior
Katie Lippert and second senior co-cap-
tain Caroline Keefer, as well as aburgeon— '
ing star in sophomore Roosa Arvas.

Arvas, a. native of Finland, was a,

fourth—team All—American and paced the t

Panthers with 14 points all while acclimat-
‘ing to a new culture and lifestyle.

Miller said that Arvas will transition
more smoothly this year already having
experienced college play and because her
“Al§‘ést buddy,” Ella Vanhanen, is now a ‘
freshman midfielder on the squad.

Arvas carved out a niche as the team’s

excelling in pinpointing free kicks, So

“Playing with_Roosa is always reassur-
ing,” redshirt junior forward Alex Char-_
lebois said. “I know she will put the ball
in the same spot every_ time, and it is my7
job to get on the end and ﬁnish.”

_Like Arvas, Charlebois is looking for
an incoming freshman to help build on

Pitt. A transfer from Missouri, she led the
team with five goals, two of which were
game—winners.

ery time he drops back to pass. Also,
their flexibility is welcomed in a year
when the Panthers are particularly thin

at wide receiver.

Running back

The most glaring hole for the Panthers
is at the running back position, where a
group of talented but unproven backs are
battling it out in camp for the majority
of the carries.

Following the departure of Rushel
Shell and the graduation of Ray Graham,
junior Isaac Bennett —— who has 87 career
attempts .— is the most senior member
of a somewhat unknown backfield. A

True freshmen James Conner and
Rachid Ibrahim will both compete for

‘ carries in camp, but one has to assume

Bennett will attain the first crack at the
Seminole defenseon Labor Day.

A running—back—by-committee ap-
proach is most likely to be put in place.
Chryst and his team will ride that hot

- hand just like they did last year when
' Shell and Graham split.carries. !

Notice that all these notably uncer—
tain positions exist on the offensive side
of the ball. That’s because headed into
camp, the defense is set in place for the
most part, returning 11 starters to a unit

that finished 17th overallin the nation. 

I like the makeup of this team, but the
depth — (or lack thereof—— scares me.
In my best effort to be a realist and not
a die—hard, I’ll say the Panthers will win
seven games this season.

PANTHER HOLLOW

  A Augtisi 20,‘ 20i 3 {The Pitt News [A vwi/‘\N.piiineWs.iciom

Local pair envisions new Panther football stadium  

Patrick McAteer
Editor in Chief

Pitt’s mascot,’ the Panther, was
named after the mountain lions
that once called Panther Hollow
home.

This relatively isolated sec-
tion of the neighborhood, a
section of Central Oakland that
runs along Boundary Street, has
been cited by some —- includ-
ing a group of enthusiastic Pitt
alumni —— as a potential area
for a new on-campus football
stadium. But don’t expect the
modern day Panthers to call the

..Hollow home any time soon.

’ Although Pitt and local com-
munity organizations have ex-
pressed their skepticism, Mike
Andra and John Mack, two Pitt

‘alums, are adamant that an_ on-

campus stadium will benefit
not only the University, but the
Oakland community as a whole.

For Andra, it boils down to
two simple factors: the game-
day experience and economics._

“If the game-day experience’

«As fun, people will go as opposed

to watching on TV,” Andra said
in an email. “If people hang out
before the game because there
is more to do and see-, people
will spend more money. Money

‘. in Oakland small businesses and

University pockets is a good
thing.”
Beginnings ,
According to Mack, a 1977
graduate of Pitt’s School of En-
gineering, his grassroots efforts

;~=sto introduce a plan for building

an on-campus stadium began
after he and other users of the

‘ Pitt fan blog, Pitt Blather, began

discussing a post on The Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette’s community

.blog,,written byjohn Baranows-

ﬁn-.4

' ki. The post originally appeared

on Bleacher Report.

The discussion garnered a
number of responses, and one V
of the respondents was Andra,

' a1992 graduate. At that point in

.,T:"*“"t'vime, Mack had already created

a website dedicated to the idea
of‘ building a new Pitt stadium in
Panther Hollow. Andra said he
was highly impressed with the
website, especially since Mack

,.;,,admitted that he had little expe-

_rience in website design..

on their love of Pitt and their
passion -for a new on-campus

about 12 other members to the ,

group.

The Plan _

Mack and Andra’s plan is far
from short—term. Both men con-
sider the plan a long-term solu-
tion to Heinz Field’s inevitable

 deterioration within-'20‘ to 25 j

’ years. ‘They say vthat‘-Pittfneeds

to consider «where the football ’

team will play if the Pittsburgh

Steelers decide to build their
next stadium in a location out-

~ side the Pittsburgh city limits.

From the outset, Mack knew
that he didn’t want the new fa-

A cility to serve-simply as a home V
to the football team. In addi-
tion toa stadium that could hold
from 44,000 to 50,000 people,‘

fice space. ‘

But in his opinion, the most
crucial portion of the plan is
itspemphasis on highlighting’
the aesthetics of Pitt’s campus,
which factored into his decision
to pinpoint Panther Hollow as
the decided location. ‘

-‘‘So I thought about it and

said, ‘What makes Pitt “Pitt?” _

stadium’s open entrance.

Of course, Pitt’s urban cam-
pus presents a number of space

constraints. In order to make _

room for the large new com-
plex, a number of properties in

Panther Hol_low between Jon-V

caire and Boundary streets and
Yarrow Way would need to be
purchased. In addition, Mack
said the_Frick Fine Arts Building
would need to be moved onto
Schenley Plaza, and Mazeroski
Field would. be demolished,

though he said the new stadium A

would also include a Pittsburgh
Pirates museum. V
The next area of concern for
Mack and Andra is parking and
transportation. . i . _
Mack said the plan includes
‘the building of a multi—leve1
parking garage that couldshold
betwe_en 1,200 and 1,500‘ ve-
hicles. He also said that the Al-
legheny Valley Railroad could
expand its commuter service op-,
erations and extend into Panther
Hollow using the pre—existing
railway. _ v i
In a project of this magnitude’,

cost is always a factor, and Mack .i
and Andra readily admit this. '
They project that, in total, the,

project_would cost $700 ‘lnillioin,
with all funding corn'ing'fr'o.m;
alumni benefactors. They also‘
projected that_the new stadiunrg
would lead to about $47 million;

Andra said in an email that
cost and revenue projections

were based on a cost analysis j

recently performed by Colora-

do State University in regard to? _'

building a stadium on the'uni-,;
versity’s campus. He said a proj-:3

' ect of this magnitude wouldn’f

begin until a funding source is
— guaranteed. ’ 7
Though the plan is in its
early stages, Mack said they’ve

formed a nonprofit .organiza-.
tion_ and are beginning talks’
with an architectural firm to”

create a number of.renderings".

New head coach hopes to help Pitt write ‘different story’ in ACC

Caitlin Hinsey
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh women’s volleyball looks to build
upon its last season in the Big East as it transi- '
tions to the Atlantic Coast Conference.

The team held a 17-14 overall record while
going 7-8 in its ﬁnal season in the Big East, but
the Panthers hope their inaugural season in
the ACC will create a different story for them.

‘The team returns ﬁve physical, core starters
from last year’s team and 12 players overall,
providing the girls with veteran leadership that
will hopeﬁilly help them achieve their goals for
the season. ' W

“I think we are a pretty physical squad. We
have height and a lot of good arms. We can put
a lot of pressure on teams offensively,” head
coach Daniel Fisher said.

With the team returning the majority of
its players this season, the Panthers have an
opportunity to make a run for their ultimate
goal: a chance to compete in and win the NCAA
tournament.

Helping the team to try and achieve this goal
is new head coach Dan Fisher. Fisher’s ﬁrst sea-
son at Pitt is backed by two years ofhead coach-
ing professionally and a proven track record.

Fisher held the head coaching position at
Concordia University in Portland, Ore., where
he compiled a record of 75-2, which constituted

a .974win‘ningpercentage. In his last season at A

among others . Pitt News ﬁle photo . '

Concordia, Fisher coached his team to a perfect  .

38-0 record while leading members to their
ﬁrst—ever NationalAssociation oflntercollegiate
Athletics national championship title.

Fisher hopes to continue his postseason
success by leading the Panthers to their twelfth

NCAA appearance and their ﬁrst—ever national *

championship.

Some players who Fisher-anticipates to have
a great upcoming seasonthis fall arejunior set-
ter Lindsey Zitzke, senior outside hitter Monica
Wignot, junior libero Delaney Clesen and junior
outside hitterjessica Wynn.

“Based on our spring season, Lindsey Zitzke,
Monica Wignot, Delaney Clesen and Jessica
Wynn are the players that Pittfans should watch
out for,” Fisher said.

Zitzke led the team in assists last year with
909, almost 700 more than any other team-

mate, and Clesen led the team in digs with 292. 7’

Wynn led the team with 267 kills while Wignot,
whowas a second-team All-Big East performer,
produced 80 blocks forthe Panthers.

Not only is this season an exciting one for

_ the Panthers because they will return 12 of last

season’s players, but they will also face some

' new opponents — in conference and out of

conference. The Panthers will face four of the

top ﬁve teams inthe2Q12 ACC rankings intheir
inaugural season. _ _ A

Some of the tougher ACC opponents that the
Panthers will face on the road include Florida
State and North Carolina. Theﬂl also have home
matches against stout ACC opponents such as
North Carolina State and Clemson. 4

Assistant coach Lindsey Campbell has high
expectations for the season, but she under-
stands the difﬁculties that the Panthers will face.

“We expect to compete in every game and
make a push for the NCAA tournament,” Camp-
bell said. “But how that translates into wins and
losses is tough to predict.”

The most thrilling opponent that the Pan-

thers face is Tauron MKS Dabrowa Gornicza on
Sept. 3 at the Fitzgerald Field House in the Pitt
International Classic. .
“This competition will give our team a
chance to compete against one of Europe’s best

’ teams,” Fisher said.

Tauron MKS Dabrowa Gornicza is a profes-
sional team in Poland that plays in the Liga Slat-
kowki Kobiet, also known as the Polish Women’s
Volleyball League. The team captured the silver

medal in the CEV Champions League in a tour-
nament that brings together 24 teams from all
over the European continent. One member of
the Dabrowa team was even a participant in the
2012 Summer Olympics for Poland.

To Fisher, though, winning isn’t everything.

“I expect the team to compete for every
point, but to be great teammates as well,” Fisher
said. ' .-

While he “expects the team to compete for

‘ every point,” he also emphasizes that they need

to be “great teammates” to one another.
He also hopes the girls on the team realize
that playing collegiate volleyball is a great oppor-

tunity that most people aren’t able to experience. A

This sense of humility seems already present in
the team’s attitude, particularly when looking
to its most recent out—of-the—gym experience.

Team members took time out of their latest
preseason training to help teach special needs
children how to rideltwo-wheeled bicycles at
the Amazing Bike Camp, which was held in
-Monroeville. Giving back to the community,
according to Fisher, is “something [the team]
will continue to do.” I

Hockey maybe a better alternative than football for youth

Patrick McAteer
Editor in Chief

Anyone who has ever played tackle football
understands what it feels like to be “ear-
holed,” or to have a blocker ram his face
mask into the side of a defender’s helmet.

It’s the type of hit that leaves a lasting
impression. A headache and ringing ears
affect a player’s short—term play, but it’s
the mental impact that’s often detrimental
to future performance. Strangely enough,
picking himself off the turf after a blindside
hit of this nature, a player almost always
feels fortunate the impact didn’t leave him
concussed.

Unfortunately, hits like this are all
too common in football’s developmental
leagues, such as Pop Warner. Certain players
are simply more physically developed than
others, which can often lead to serious head
injuries. As troubling as this trend is, there
might be a solution. Oddly enough, it can be
found in Michigan’s-youth hockey program.

Unlike many other states where young
players often travel hundreds of miles to play
countless periods of .hard—hitting hockey,
Michigan has begun a transition toward a
system based on player development rather

cerns over the direction of the NCAA. Some,

-like the ACC’s]ohn Swofford and the Big 12’s

Bob Bowlsby, have suggested that it’s time

p for “transformative change.”

“We have supported and continue to sup-
portthe NCAA as the appropriate governing
organizationfor intercollegiate athletics,”
SEC commissioner Mike Slive said during
the SEC Media Days. “But at the same time,
however, we will continue to push for chang-
es we believe are in the best interest of our
student athletes.” '

Emmert can’t ignore the powerbrokers
from the Big 5 conferences when they start
beating the drums of change. They lead the
leagues with all of the money and all of the
power. They are the ones who are looking
to gain the most from reform.

The heat is on, and Emmert is beginning
to feel it. ’

The low point came in April when, dur'-
ing a news conference for the NCAA men’s
basketball tournament, Emmert became
combative and deﬁant while answering

questions from the media about the way

he handled problems.
“I know you’re disappointed,” Emmert

“ said, “but I’m still here.”

Emmert’s tune changed during the next
few months, especially when the questions
came from conference commissioners in—_

stead of reporters. In fact, he’s gone out of

his way to become more ‘agreeable when it
comes to changes for the future.

But just what is wrong with the NCAA?

“I think they are seriously behind the
time,” said Gail Sideman, a national sports
publicist. “Twenty years ago, [the NCAA]
was ﬁve years ‘behind and now it’s 40 years
behind.” ' V .-

“It has the interest of student athletes

‘in mind ifjit was 1960,” she added. “I think

they are seriously behindthe time.”

Sideman said the NCAA can’t keep up
with everything from technology to re-
cruiting and it’s frustrating school officials
across the country. The NCAA rule book, for
instance, is close to 500 pages.

“Who in their right mind can digest that,
let alone a university compliance ofﬁcer,”
Sideman said.

To his credit, Emmert has acknowledged
that the NCAA sometimes gets bogged
down in legislation and proposed a more
streamlined version of the rule book. Yet
even when the organization tried to simplify
things, it only seemed to create more chaos.

The NCAA Rules Committee introduced
new recruiting legislation earlier this spring
that was supposed to make things easier
for recruits and coaches. Instead, it caused
major concern about the pressure it would
put on high school athletes and was tabled
until it could be restructured.

So what can be done?

“I think the thought, by many now, is

that maybe the governance of college ath1et- -

ics isn’t needed through the NCAA,” Lugin-

bill said. “Whether it is or it isn’t, there’s ‘a _

lot of people of believe they can formulate
a bett_erplan.’.’ ‘l A ' " -

‘COLLEGE FOOTBALL

Florida State faces major transition year

W Chris Dufresne

MCT Campus

There will be plenty of fresh faces
at Florida State games this season
and one very old one.
 After years of irreconcilable
differences, former coach Bobby
Bowden has agreed to be honored
at the football kingdom he built
from scratch in the 1970s.
Bowden, after 33 years, was
pushed out after the 2009 season
and hasn’t attended a game since.
He said he wanted to stay
behind the‘ scenes to let Jimbo

' Fisher develop the program, but

there was no denying a lingering
bitterness.

‘ That ends this year when
Bowden returns for “Bobby
Bowden Day” on Oct. 26 against
North Carolina State and then
again Nov. 17 versus Syracuse as

part of the 20-year anniversary
tribute to the 1993 national title
team.

Bowden also won‘ a national
title in 1999 and dominated
the Atlantic Coast Conference
from the moment Florida State
joined in 1992. His 389 victories
rank first among major-college
coaches. J

It’s nice to see both sides have
agreed to bury the spear.

Bowden will see a team he
would have loved to coach, very
young but very talented.

He wouldn’t like the way they
rush quarterbacks to the lineup
these days as Bowden always pre-
ferred third—year juniors.

With E] Manuel off to the NFL,
however, Florida State will be
youngest where it counts°most,
the only reason the Seminoles
aren’t ranked higher.

That doesn’t mean Florida

‘State can’t be good. There has’

been_a growing buzz about red-
shirt freshman Jameis Winston
since he dazzled everyone in the
spring game.

(6 feet 4) and bigger (227 pounds)

Winston has the personality
to attract voters with his love
for cheese balls and distaste for
boorish behavior.

“If I ever get Manziel disease, I
want all of you to smack me in the

Winston said at media day.

Plenty of “non-starters” from

COLLEGE FOOTBALL COLUMN

Manziel investigation reveals

Matt Murschel

 MCT Campus.

When is a signature worth more
than the paper it’s written on?
When that signature belongs to
Johnny Manziel, apparently.
Aweek after it came to light the
Texas A&M quarterback was being
investigated by the NCAA for alleg-

edly accepting cash in exchange for A
his signature on helmets and pho- “

. gggraphs, Manziel went from the
NCAA’s most-wanted to poster boy
for injustice in college athletics.

Critics cried foul that athletes
like Manziel or South Carolina’s
Jadeveon Clowney, Ohio State’s
Braxton Miller and USC’s Marq-
 Lee make millions of dollars
for the NCAA and their respective
schools, but they receive little be-

' yond tuition in return.

Rules are rules and NCAA by-
law 12.5.2.1 clearlystates an ath-
gte cannot proﬁt from his or her
own likeness in any way. It’s a rule
taught to athletes from Day One
right after where the dining- hall
is located and what time is curfew.
Is it fair?
Absolutely not. But until change
enacted, it’s still a rule and must
‘be followed. _ «
However, the NCAA didn’t help
its case when it decided to sell'spe-

H-

ciﬁc player memorabilia on its own
website. 7 -

The NCAA’s dirty little secret
was exposed by ESPN college has-
ketball analystjay Bilas, who took
to Twitter last week to point out
that a simple search on shopncaa-
sports.com for Manziel’s. name,
brought up a Texas A&M jersey’s

with Manziel’s No. 2 on it. A similar -

search for other well-known play-
ers names returned similar results.

If that wasn’tbad enough, Bruce
Feldman of CBSSports.com high-

lighted a search on the site that V

found autographed photos of for-
mer USC player Reggie Bush going
for $180 apiece. The NCAA made
money off Bush while telling USC
it had to disassociated itself from
Bush, one of many sanctions levied
for impermissible beneﬁts Bush
received while at USC.

NCAA president Mark Emmert
offered a mea culpa, admitting the
NCAA shouldn’t‘be in the memo-
rabilia—selling business. Calling it
“hypocritical,” Emmert said the
organization would no longer be
selling team-related items on its

-website.

Too little, too late if you ask me.

Signed memorabilia is big busi-
ness and one that does not beneﬁt
amateur athletes.

Do a search for a player such as
Manziel on a popular website like
eBay.com and at any given time

you’ll ﬁnd hundreds of items up

for"“auction. A white Texas A&M .

helmet signed by the Heisman Tro-
phy winner was listed at $2,000,
while an autographed photo was
available for $6. Items signed by
Clowney, Miller and Lee also bring
in big money. From footballs to
jerseys, helmets to photographs,

However, for every child, there are

Conference re—alignment consolidating power in college football

Chris Dufresne
M C T Campus

*LOS ANGELES _ Welcome to the season
Urban Meyer, Mark Emmert and Johnny
Manziel ‘can’t wait to get started.

All three of these -men, in some form
or fashion, had issues with their snooze
alarms.

Oregon skips merrily into fall camp
like a schoolchild after getting a proba-
tionary wrist slap only a few years after
the NCAA sent USC to San Quentin for
jaywalking. . '

USC-coach Lane Kifﬁn is reportedly

not on the hot seat despite what hap-

pened last year on the surface ofthe Sun
Bowl. e .

And get this: UCLA not only won its
first NCAA baseball title with its brand
of gutty—little-Bruins ball, but it also has
been picked toifinish ahead of USC in
football for the first time since 2001.

Can’t wait for the new improved show:
“Whose Town is it Anyway?”

Football was put on Earth because it
is fantastically fun but it has also loath-
somely become a “Bonﬁre of the Vanities”
of power, control, greed, money, access
and more power.

This is the 16th (and last) year of the
tired Bowl Championship Series as the
sport dramatically transitions, recali-
brates and uncomfortably squirms.

While England rejoices over the birth
of young Prince George, everyone here
knows the Southeastern Conference is
king that lords over its subjects. The
league has won seven straight national
titles and will be favored to win its eighth.

Commissioner Mike Slive, an avuncu-
lar guy who calls himself a “recovering
lawyer,” opened his SEC state of the union
news conference with his usual “brag
bag” of accomplishments.

Bully (pulpit) for him.

The operative word moving forward,
though, is “change.”

Some of it has already been formally
rubber-stamped.

A new four-team playoff is coming
in two years but not until the Rose Bowl
hosts its 100th game on Jan. 1 and the
last BCS title game or_1]a‘n.6.

Schools are switching leagues almost
as fast as coaches are switching schools.

The change gurgling below, though, is
about the consolidation of power.

Darwinism has already claimed Big
East football and left five power leagues
to distribute $5.6 billion over the next
12 years.

Protecting. .

Thebig boppers are the SEC, Big Ten,

' Pac-12, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12,

who have severely separated themselves
from “the Group of Five”: Mountain West,
Mid-American Conference, Sun Belt,
Conference USA and the new American
Athletic Conference.’

The Power Five controls about 75 per-
cent of the new money and wants to use it
to pay its scholarship student—athletes a
“full cost of attendance” stipend ranging
from $2,000 to $5,000 per year.

It’s a noble gesture and also a conve-
nient power grab to further segregate
from the working class. . ‘ .

The move, though, is being blocked by
a majority of 348 schools in“the NCAA’s
top division (those ungrateful, whiny,
non—football powers).

The Big Five could choose to break
away from the NCAA and form its own
organization.

“I donzt seesecession as a legitimate
point of leverage except as a last resort,”
Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said
at media day. .

It was news, though, that Bowlsby eve
mentioned the “S” word. -

The five power commissioners have
strategically -used increasingly magni-
fied NCAA dysfunction under Emmert
to launch its_ agenda armada. _

The commissioners, one by one, al-
most in orchestrated concert, started

1»

laying out the future in their media-day ~

addresses. _
Bowlsby said, “Transformative change
is going to have to happen.”

Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany, ,-

more of a traditionalist, framed it this
way: “I think there’s a lot of momentum
for the tradition, but there are also head
winds out there also.”

Slive mentioned in his address, “The
NCAA has not been successful in meeting
the full cost of attendance of our future
athletes.” ‘

Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said
Friday the message was not necessarily
coordinated among the commissioners.
He ‘said everything just sort of chain-
reacted after Slive’s opening-salvo com-
ments. , 7

Scott thought Bowlsby’s comments
about secession could have been misin-
terpreted. .

Scott said the major football confer-
ences can, and should, solve their prob-
lems as members of the NCAA.

He said, “I believe it would be a colos-
sal failure by everyone” to take major
college football outside the system.

The power brokers simply want to use
their wildly disproportionate amount
of television money the way they want.

The commissioners who cut the hu-
mongous TV deals have taken a strangle-
hold over the sport since the Supreme
Court ruled 30 years ago the NCAA was

-_. a monopoly with no right to dictate how

many games could be televised.

“You can’t lose focus on the fact that
before the NCAA lost control of college
football TV, we had one game on a week,”
Delany said at Big Ten media day.

The ﬁve power conferences could
opt to form another division within the
NCAA.

“It’s an option,” Scott said Friday, “but

it might not be necessary.”

Scott thinks the bureaucratically
bogged down NCAA simply needs to be-
come more “nimble and flexible.”

Emmert, who has maneuvered himself
into a box, seems agreeable to this and
has promised signiﬁcant change within
a year. _

Some would say: What other choice
does he have?

History has proved that, in most cases,
you should never bet against power and
money.

In the college world, football is power,
and football is money. i

 

Fox Sports 1 to challenge ESPN

Joe Flint
M CT Campus

LOS ANGELES _ “I think it’S time for ESPN
to get a little competition, don’t you?”
That tough talk is coming from an un-
likely source _ 81-year-old Regis Philbin.
The former daytime television talk show

. host and David Letterman foil is one of the

faces of Fox Sports 1, the cable network
launching Saturday that is the latest David
looking to knock off ESPN’s Goliath.

Given that Philbin is more accustomed
to speaking to housewives and is more than
twice as old as the viewers Fox Sports 1 is
hoping to attract, his hiring seems unusual
to say the least.

“It is a bit out of left ﬁeld, but that’s
what we do,” said Fox Sports Co—President
Eric Shanks of the hiring of Philbin to host
“Crowd Goes Wild,” an afternoon round
table that will also feature former Balti-
more Raven Trevor Pryce, Wall StreetJour—
nal columnistjason Gay and Katie Nolan,
best known for her racy sports-related
YouTube videos.

“I never thought I would be on an hour-
long sports show,” Philbin said, adding
he wasn’t even aware Fox was launching
the channel when he was asked to meet

NCDRT  L

(fl il<T:~?  .~

with Shanks. Since then, the hard—core
Notre Dame football and New York Yan-
kees fan has been taking a crash course on
the rest of the sports world. “From now
on I’m going to have to keep my eye on
everything,” he said, adding that he’d been
reading about Ryan Braun, the Milwau-
kee Brewers slugger suspended for using
performance—enhancing drugs.

The launch of Fox Sports 1 and small-
er sister channel Fox Sports 2 highlights
the dominant and growing role sports is
playing in the industry. At a time when
broadcast and cable networks are strug-
gling to keep viewersin front of their sets
and off the Internet, sports has become
their sureﬁre antidote to Web surfing and
cord-cutting.

Fox, which has made a career out of
taking on giants, first with its broadcast
network and later with its cable news chan-
nel, will be starting this ﬁght with one
hand tied behind its back. Fox Sports 1
doesn’t have distribution deals locked up
with some of the nation’s biggest pay-TV
operators, including Time Warner Cable
and DirecTV. There’s agood chance that
when Fox Sports 1 goes live.Saturday with

a NASCAR race that much of Los Angeles g

won’t be able to see it.

l20 ‘

The competition is formidable. “It is not
a hill they have to climb, it’s the Grand Can-
yon,” said Mark Shapiro,'a former ESPN
executive. “ESPN has built such a big moat
around itself the Russian army of the Cold
War couldn’t get in.” -

Moreover, while no one in sports broad-
casting likes to hear it, there is not exactly
a shortage of product out there. When
ESPN launched in 1979, the consensus
was there‘ weren’t enough sports or fans
to sustain a 24-hour cable network. Flash
forward 34 years and now the sports that
critics used to make fun of ESPN for car-
rying have whole networks of their own.

_There’s a channel devoted to fishing. An-

other aimed at horse racing enthusiasts.
Big game hunters have two networks tar-
geting them. ‘

There are more than 2 _0 national sports
networks that don’t have the letters E-S-P-
N in their names. The NFL, Major League
Baseball, the NHL and NBA all have their
own channels on top of the billions they
rake in selling their games to other na-
tional and local outlets. Tennis and golf
also rate their own networks. Several col-
lege conferences including the Big-12 and

Pac-10-have launched their own channels.
The big broadcast networks and cable
channels also have a heavy diet of sports.
CBS, NBC and Fox all carry the NFL _ and
at a hefty price; the league now pockets
an estimated $7 billion a year from media.
In Los Angeles alone, the Angels, Lakers
and Dodgers each have separate channels.
And that ever expanding universe, more
than -beating ESPN, is what is mot_ivat~
ing Fox. “In the shaky swampy world of
television programming,.the one solid
granitelike area is sports,” said David Hill,
a senior executive vice president of Fox
Sports 1 parent 21st Century Fox and the
self-proclaimed father of the new network.
Hill, who ran Fox Sports for decades
and now oversees “American Idol” and
“The X-“Factor,” is known as an innova-
tive producer. It was ‘Hill who first came
up with what now seems like an obvious
idea to have the score and time left in a
game superimposed on the screen. He put
microphones inside bases to bring fans
closer to the action. "
“We spend more time and effort on
audio than anyone else,” hesaid proudly.
“Close-up audio is far more emotive than
close-up video.” ‘ '
Shanks ‘said Fox Sports 1 has hired a
couple hundred people in front of the cam-
era and behind the scenes. 'I;he majority
of the shows_will be done on the Fox lot in
Century City where a huge new soundstage
was recently completed. For Shanks, who

« started in production at CBS'Sports, the

trick is to give fans an “information pill

_ with a little bit of sugar.”

1 Itsflagship show “Fox Sports Live,” a
nightly three—hour recap of the clay’s high-
lights and news,’ will be anchored by Jay
Onrait and Dan O’Toole, two unknowns
imported from Canada, where they hosted
f_‘SportsCe'ntre” for the TSN sports chan-
nel. Thepair are known for their morning
zoo style, poking fun at the absurdities of
sport with an ironic sensibility inspired by
Conan O’Brien and Letterman.

. While some sportscasters are obsessed
with statistics and overanalysis, Onrait and
Q’Too,le want to keep it light.”We’re not
good enough broadcasters to be serious,”
cracked Onrait, who resembles a young
Vince Vaughn. ‘

_ The two have been compared to Dan
Patrick and Keith Olbermann, whose stint
as hosts of ESPN’s “SportsCenter” in the
1990s helped make that cable channel part
Of the zeitgeist.

According to Shanks there is a simple

litmus test for Fox Sports 1 personalities: _

‘.330 you want to hang out and have nachos
with our guys?” ’ V

g V’ But Fox Sports 1 will need more than a
pair of wise—cracking Canadians and a spry
Octogenarian to bring ESPN to its knees.
Not only does ESPN have a more than 30-
year head start, it also hasljust about every

major sport including the National Football _

League locked up for the next several years.

While Fox has football on its broadcast net-
work, a cable package may remain a dream
for the time being. Wednesday, Fox did seal
a high proﬁle deal to telecast the U.S. Open
men’s and women’s golf championships.
ESPN is the engine that drives its par-
ent Walt Disney Co., making close to'$1o
billion annually in subscriber fees and ad
revenues. It is often, especially during
football season, one of the most—watched
cable networks. Last season’s “Monday
Night Football” games averaged 13 mil-
lion viewers.
' Hill knows changing the habits of sports
fans won’t be easy. “The first thing we have

to battle is inertia,” he said “We understand .

that. We know it. We get it.”

Fox isn’t going into the ﬁght completely
unarmed. It has rights to NASCAR, a big
chunk of college football, ultimate ﬁght-
ing, lots of soccer and starting next year
Major League Baseball. “We’re starting

from a pretty strong position,” Hill said. A

On his wish list are the NBA and the NFL,
but the latter could be locked up into the
next decade.

Hill and Shanks point to Fox News as
evidence that there is room not only for
it to exist but to perhaps one day even
topple ESPN.

* “Would you pick this point in time to go
into a business that people think is mature
and people think, ‘Gosh, do you need an-
other national multi-sport network?’ And
the question is, did people think therewas
enough news when CNN was giving people
24 hours of news every day?” Shanks asked.

The addition of a new sports channel

will give media buyers something to lever- .

age against ESPN. “Competition is good,”
said Sam Armando, a senior.vice president
in Chicago at SMGx, a media buying ﬁrm.

While Armando doesn’t think Fox Sports _

1 will immediately challenge ESPN, it has
enough big sports to get a serious look
from advertisers. ,

-ESPN President John Skipper isn’t

sweating Fox Sports 1 and doesn’t think '
. the Fox News analogy works. “If CNN'had

exclusive rights to the inauguration, elec-

tion results and weather,” he said, “Fox -

News wouldn’t have snuck up and whupped
them.”
ESPN has been shelling out billions to

, lock up marquee events, including the Bowl

Championship Series. Besides its roster of
professional sports, it has rights to prac-
tically all the big college football confer-
ences and marquee tennis events, includ-
ing Wimbledon tennis. “We bought up a
lot'of beachfront property,” Skipper said.
Still, it’d be foolish to dismiss Fox Sports
1. CBS made that mistake 2o years ago
when Rupert Murdoch swooped in and
outbid it for rights to the NFL,“a deal that
lifted the Fox network into the big leagues.
Hillis optimistic Fox Sports can get
on the map quickly. “It will take us two or
three years to create a visible and emo-
tional bookmark in people’s minds to say,
‘I’m going to switch on Fox Sports 1.”’ ﬂ
