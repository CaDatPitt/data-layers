New Course Numbers

    Foul Textbook Orders

Changes in course numbers, greater than expected reg-
istration for some courses, and late requisitions by profes- .
sors, are some of the factors contributing to the difficulty
students may have in procuring certain books at the Univer-
“sity Book ‘Center.

Reports On

Lab ACTH

After testing synthetic ACTH
(adrenocorticotropic hormone) in
humans, University researchers
have found it-s biological activity
close to that of natural ACTH.
The source of the natural hor-
mone is the pituitary, or “master,”
gland. It triggers the release of
cortisone and other steriods from
the cortex, or outer shell, of the
adrenal gland into the“ system.

Cortisone is employed in the
remedial treatment of rheumatic
arthritis, rheumatic fever, and
other diseases.

Dr. ‘Klaus Hofmann, who last
year directed the work to obtain
-synthetic. ACTH, reported the re-
sults of its first clinical trial to
scientists attending the Laurential
Hormone Conference in San,
Francisco, California, last Tues-
day. A

In his report, Dr. Hoffman in-
cluded the test procedure. Nine
healthy adults and one female
patient received intramuscular

. injections of the synthetic hor-
mone once each day. The nine
adults were treated for a period

of seven days; the patient, for
14 days.

No adverse effects or local re-
actions developed in the group,
and the female patient improved
to the same extent that she had
after a dose of natural ACTH.

Dr. I-Iofmann also reported that
the synthetic hormone has prop-
erties unique from those of the
‘natural ACTH. These, he stated,
may show that it is possible in
the future to form synthetic mole-
cules which would house speciﬁc
beneﬁcial effects.

Supervising the clinical trials
were_Dr. Thaddeus S. Danowski,
professor of medicine, and Dr.
Campbell Moses Jr., director of
the Addison H. Gibson Labora-
tory, both of whom are at the

mass starts at 10 a.m.

This year graduate students along with undergraduates
have been hit with curriculum revisions in the University’s
attempt for an intensiﬁed academic atmosphere.

The University Graduate Council ruled that writing

theses should no longer be mandatory for candidates for

Book Reviews

Slated For Fall

Prof. Lawrence Lee
A Set For First Program
The Fine Books Room of the

University Book Center will offer

book reviews of new releases‘ ev-
ery two weeks.

These reviews are held to stim-
ulate interest in current litera-
ture and in current events, as
many of the reviewed books deal
with current situations.

. The reviewers may be well
known personalities from the
University, the city of Pittsburgh
or the general literary world. At

times an author will be present‘

to review his own work.

The first review will be on
' September 28, at 4:15 p.m. in the
Fine Books Room. Prof. Law-'
rence Lee of the English ,De-
partment will discuss “To Kill
a Bockingbird,” by Harper Lee.

A new series of records is av-
ailable at the Book" «Center, en-
titled “Time for Ideas.” These re-
cords will be broadcast in a ser-
ies under the same name over
WDUQ-FM every Friday night at
9 p.m., beginning Oct. 6.

The series features voices of
great minds in the areas of let-
ters, social men, political
thought, American history and
philosophy.

The Book Center also announ-
ced a new series of ﬁve minute
broadcasts over WKJF-FM, Mon-
day through4Friday at 9:55 p.m.,
entitled “Inside Books.” This ser-
ies will include taped sbrief re-
views of current books by person-
nel of the University Book Cen-
ter or other offices of the Uni-

versity.

‘Nightmare At Pitt’

Registration Confused This Term

\ Many students experienced reg-
istration this year as a nightmare
with all the trimmings of long
lines, incubator weather and miss-
ing invoices.

Richard Hodges, director of Stu-
dent Records, cited many reasons
for the ordeal which University
members‘ witnessed or smothered
in last week.

The trouble "began in June when
the Liberal Arts bulletin came off
the press, indicating that many
new and attractive courses would
be offered in the Fall. Students
started then to alter the schedules
that they had set up in the early
part of the Spring term in order

to include some of the new
courses. ’
. Undesirable Saturday classes

and poor advising on the part of
instructors were other reasons
mentioned by Hodges for schedule
changing.

In addition to these familiar
problems, there were more rea-
sons for the chaotic registration.
One cause is ‘having new, but‘
unexpected, faces at the Uni-
versity this term.

When registration changes were
made on Friday, Hodges said that
50 per cent of the people present
in the Commons Room were new

students. On S a t u r d a y, 70 per '

cent of the people packed into the

 

 

Cathedral were also new people.
Not Enough Working
Hodges explained that not ex-
pecting these students, “we just
didn’t have enough people work-

ing to take care of all that were

trying to register.” a He added that
this is the good thing about reg-
istration this year—the student
body will be much larger than
was expected.

Also standing in the registra-
tion lines were the students who
never received their kits through
the mail. Although the 10,683
kits for part and full-time stu-
dents were mailed out to the
out-of-town students by Aug.
22 and to the Pittsburgh stu-

‘the masters degree.

Three choices now lay open for
department heads: thesis writing
can be eliminated entirely, the in-
dividual student can decide his
own fate, or the thesis can remain
as the basic requirement for a
masters degree.

Many departments have set i.

up seminar systems whereby i
each student is required to coni-

' plete his masters training in two
trimesters. In that time a sig-

, niﬁcant ‘amount of research
writing will be required, accord-
ing to Albert J. Martin, dean of
the School of Liberal Arts.

Dr. George Crouch, head of the
English department, said that
graduate students seeking masters
degrees in his department would
write out seminar projects instead
of theses.

“We felt that too much time
was being spent on the thesi's,”
Dr. Crouch said. “Since the thesis
was used to judge the graduate’s
potential in research, we feel that
seminar papers can perform the
same function with less time in-
volved. In this way a graduate
would have more time to complete
his Ph.D.'’

Dr. Crouch considers the Ph.D.
paper as a publishable. contri-
bution to knowledge, while mas.-
ters papers are usually ﬁled
away and rarely referred to.

The History Department has

substituted intensive research for
thesis work. Like the English De-
partment, they will rely on grad-
uate courses and papers written
for the classes.

Two reading courses, selective
problems, and two research semi-

nars will give the graduate stu- L

dents more emphasis on research.

MC Names New
Secretary; Plans

Future Programs

Men's Council, at their Thurs-
day meeting, appointed a new
Council secretary, set a policy for

day.

Howard Solomon, arts sopho-
more, was named to replace Step-
hen Pearson as Council secretary.
Pearson, elected last trimester, has
transferred to Indiana State Col-
lege.

In other action, the group de-
cided to admit new members who
present petitions signed by ﬁfty
undergraduate men. These men
will become voting members of
the council when approved by

Seminar Or Thesis

With the elimination of a masters thesis’ in many uni-
versity departments, graduate students have been initiated
into the race with time. The leisurely pace of research
and assimilation has been crammed into a two term sem-
inar program, therefore each student is required to turn
out twice as many major papers in addition to attending
supplementary ﬁeld courses.

Superﬁcially the above paragraph summarizes the re-
vised graduate curriculum at the University.

But with competition as it is today and the -number of
students now continuing their education, the masters degree
is fast losing its prestige just as the bachelors degree fell
in value ﬁve years ago. If the extra year used by most stu-
‘dents to write their theses can be dropped, more Ph.D.

‘candidates will be able to complete their doctorate training

in the idealistic three years.

In addition, the idea of-a 200 page dissertation on an
original subject is psychologically more appealing when
‘freshly approached rather than ground out immediately
following a major thesis. Hopefully such a situation will
encourage more students to continue their education.

Academically, the revised program provides such stim-
ulation. The same process of advising and supervisionris
retained from the old method, but more emphasis is placed
on the fundamental requirement of the quality of a.. scholar.
If a student’s class work fails to measure up, he will be ad-
vised to forego .Ph.D. training, at least at this university.

And here’s the rub. In its own way the University has
discriminated against the individual in favor of the or-

_ ganization, or in this case, the ﬁeld. An intensiﬁed academic

program builds a kind of tension seldom found in the work-
ing world. ’

In both ﬁelds it’s a battle of minds—-the one for, ma-
terial superiority, the other for intellectual growth. Unfor-
tunately in both, production means achievement.

The question switches to one of quantity rather than of
quality. Afteribeing carefully channeled into an intensive

U study atmosphere, the student must produce both quantity

and quality. But nowhere has provision been made for the
individual assimilation, so important to individual produc-
tion.

A speed up graduate program culls out the hangers-on
and provides the academic atmosphere needed by a scholar,
but it leaves little time for him to enjoy the depth of that
atmosphere needed to cultivate his intellectual roots.

The Tinderbox

By" Nathan Firestone

Statesmen have repeated overand over again
that the Berlin crisis places‘ us in the greatest
danger of war since 1945. And the attitude that
Premier Khrushchev has been showing to the
world is doing little to ease the tension. This is
certainly an attitude that causes
one to believe that the Soviets
are misinterpreting the resolve
Kennedy’s
words on allied rights to Berlin.
No one can yet say whether or
not it was a mistake to.merely
initiate a stiff protest against the,
communist closing of the East-
West Berlin border. At that

ment announced that if the West
were to impose ‘economic sanc-
tions, the strongest possible measure, at the time,
“Berlin would be. blockaded. The West did not ini-
tiate the economic‘ sanctions because it did not
want to push the crisis beyond a point_where suc-
cessful negotiations would no longer be possible.
Take. Take. Take I _

But the Soviets have been pl.ug‘ging, away at
Allied air access rights again in the past few days,
apparently taking the view that they may as well
get as much as they can before negotiations. start.
There are .two inherent dangers in this line of
thinking. The first is that the more they try to
take now, and get away with, the less there will
actually be for the West to negotiate.

As an example, the question of sealing off the
East-West sector border‘ is? a violation of four-
power rights in Berlin. But obviously, ‘the East
German government had to stop the refugee flow.

A month ago, this could have been a conces-
sion the Communists might have demanded from
the West. No more. The communists did it and
that's that. O ‘

The second danger is that of ,miscalc1_ilation. In
their desire to ‘get all they can, the communists
may grab too much, and touch a vital point which
the West cannot answer with only a protest.

These are the immediate dangers that lie ahead.
More will be present when the negotiations start.
It is apparent that the Allies place a greater prem-
ium on the value of world opinion than do the
communists. After the initial shock of the Soviet
announcement on resumption of nuclear tests wore

But the “neutralist” mind is such, that, on the

dismay at the Sovietannouncement, and, on the
other, demand that the West come to terms with
the Soviets, on the assumption that “its better to
be Red than dead.” ‘ *

And insthe weeks and months to come, “neu-
tralists” will put greater pressures than ever be-
fore on the West’ to surrender in the face of Soviet
threats. This thinking somewhat parallels that of
the people who advocate unilateral disarmament.
For some obscure reason, it is always‘ the West that
must disarm to show the Soviets it is acting» in good
faith, and not the other way around.

To meet this threat, the West can do a number
of things. The ﬁrst, and most important, is to work
out a really strong,’ uniﬁed standsat the foreign

And this does not mean that Washington .and

There is a certain measure of truth in his reluct-

Without careful groundwork to assure at least some
success, the summit will fail. And a summit failure
at this stage of the game would be suicide.

The West can and must intensify its propa-

Mild Registration

For Winter Term

dents by Aug. 25, many students’
never received them.

‘Financial difficulties also pro-‘

voked some of the hysteria dur-
ing registration. Hodges said that
the comptroller’s office, located on
the 24th ﬁoor,..Cl, has been. just
as swamped with work as the Of-
ﬁcei of Student Records. Students
paying by mail have not yet re-
In many
cases, he said, this occurred be-
cause the student failed to include
an envelope with his Pittsburgh
address on it.
“Not Surprised”

In addition, many students from
out-of—state have applied at the
comptroler’s office for exemption
from the higher tuition charged to
non—Pennsylvania students.

Not surprised by the registra-
tion that resembled one of those
of» the good old days, Hodges
said that he had warned other
University members to expect it.

“But everyone had already for-

» gotten what registration was like

in September, 1959,’? he continued,

“just“ like they’vé forgotten the»

past three smooth ones.”
. Predicting a smooth registration
for the winter term, Hodges ex-
plained that the past registration
both alarmed and alerted students,
advisors, and administrators. He
said that “iey will do as much as
possible to stop a reoccurence.
The Office of Student Records
will also be making some new
plans for the winter term that

every student, It is, primarily, a
yearbook and, as such, the pack-
age presents as complete a story
of the University’s past year as
would a bound volume of the
year’s editions of The’ Pitt News.

The most impressive ‘feature
of the weighty volume is, of
course, its photographs; The
shots of the social and academic
life of theschool, as well as the
athletics, activities, organiza-
tions, , physical plant and sur-
rounding area have obviously
been chosen with painstaking
care.

“The Owl” is available at the
Book Center at $7.50 per copy, or
$8.50 for the deluxe edition.

Aimed also at the entire student
body is the recently revamped
“Polaris.” Not named for a guided
missile, the book has been design-
ed to act as a guiding star for all
information-seekers on campus.

Mainly, this publication offers
the day—to—day calendar of events
and holidays for the entire year
which, in the past, cost sixty cents
alone. ‘

But the book is also packed
with information for which even
seniors grope. Phone numbers
and locations of oﬁices and or-
ganizations in and around cam-
pus are included, as well as list-
ings of regulations, cheers and
songs, University history and
traditions and hours of business
for school eateries and stores.

Editor Bob Pannier has sparked
the book with bright notations,
drawings and photographs, which
keep the guide from taking on a
“phone-directory dullness.”

“Polaris” may be purchased for
a dollar at its office in the Stu-
dent Union and at various places

on campus.

MARSHALL GOLDBERG —— Act II

Dr. John Bain Sutherland, a Scottish bachelor who coached Pitt
football teams for 15 years (1924-38), was almost a recluse. His
staid composure was seldombreached. ’

“Jock” strayed from his reservation once. “If I was a father,”
hesaid, “I would want my son to be like Marshall Goldberg.”

He was speaking‘ of a Jewish farm boy from Elkins, West Vir-
ginia, who almost went to Notre Dame, but came to Pittsburgh
instead, where his name will remain embossed forever in the
school annals. . _

“Mad Marshall" was a two-time All-American, who led the
Panthers to a national title, a Rose Bowl game, and two Eastern
championships. He scored 18 touchdowns and rushed for 1,957 yards
in three varsity seasons —— still the all-time high at Pitt.

Campus Hero

Goldberg was a swarthy hook-nosed fellow with electrified hair
tossed in waves like a turbulent sea of black. He was an ebullient
young man, relaxed and outgoing, the epitome of the regular campus
hero, e.g., it was rumored that he dated Olivia de Havilland during
a stay in Hollywood.

He was a brilliant athlete, a one-in-a~million shot, a physi-
cal miracle. He was the paragon of football skill. As a sopho-
more, he was compared to the incomparable Harold “Red"
Grange, the “Gallopin’ Ghost” of Illinois. a

The son whom Sutherland longed for has been born. Marshall‘
Goldberg, Jr., was born 19 years ago. His father is now the vice-

‘president of the Emmermann Machinery Company in Chicago. The
son is not a farm boy; neither is he ebullient. He is an only son in
whom his father has wrapped all his dreams. _

An atom-age Marshall Goldberg mustahave a price on his head.
Society’s.fangs await his arrival just to prove his validity as a
failure, not even a reasonable fascimile of ol’ “Biggie.”

Don't Even Try

George Connely remembers the original. Conneiy used to drive
the bus that transported the athletic teams at Pitt. Now he is so
arthritic that he leans on a cane. “You’ll never be like your old
man,” he told young Goldberg. ‘‘He was a jewel . . . never be any-
one like him. Don’tleven try!” ‘

   
   

Marshall has tried. He is still struggling to gain recognition.
He acquired delusions of grandeur during his childhood. Only
he was not‘ cut out from the heroic Horatio Alger pattern. He
is not hungry. And his dream castles are starting to tumble
down around his cars.

It would take a bit of a miracle for Marshall to realize his
dreams. He has, however, a big treasure of talent which he’s not
entirely certain how to handle. He has much to learn you might
think, but also much to forget. But you only forget when you ain’t.

When someone says something that slights him, he is hurt. He
may conceal his hurt, but this makes it no less real. He is honest,
terse, hurt in a way that counts.

"Typical Jewish Boy"

_ He can be hard and ironic; he has learned his words well within
the prison walls of his hard-earned loneliness and individuality. His
-perceptions are formidable and really illuminating when he lets his
mind go to town.

Marshall was sitting alone in the dressing room at the pre-

season training camp at Allegheny College. He was unshaven, dark-

Leeson Loathes ‘Lost’ Linemengg

Running Excuses Poor Blocks

‘Missing Link’ May
Help 1961 C-Boys

Rick Leeson indulges in
about the least contact work
of any Pitt football player in
the daily srimmage sessions.
The tow-head fullback can-
didate, who resembles a vig-
nette version of “Crusher” Lisow-
ski of the grunt and groan sport,
does not shy away from contact,
he’s just alergic to it.

.'Only the frustrated would—be

as Leeson moves like a leaden
marionette over, around and

The defenses just can’t contain
the former All-America high-
schooler who is ﬁnding himself
again. «

The coaches will tell you, how-
ever, that he can’t block. This
virtue is a prime essential in the
make-up of a Pitt fullback in
their power-play offense. The
Browns’ Jimmy Brown and the
Colts’ Lenny Moore “ain’t no
blocker either,” but their scoring
helps to offset the deﬁciency.

Blocking Not Sharp

Pitt’s blocking‘ strength last
year, in general, was sadly defic-
ient. Most. skeptics belittle the ef-
forts of Fred Cox and Bob Clem-
ens in 1960, not realizing that the
blocking assignments were not ex-
ecuted as sharply as the previous
campaign when that pair sprang
loose for the long gainers.

“Recruiting Difficulties

Only 26 Frosh Gridders
Receive Scholarship Aid

By BOB SMIZIK

Pitt’s valient effort to maintain
big-time football despite the con-
tinual raising of academic stand-
ards seems" to be running into a
little trouble. Only 26 scholarships
were doled out to football players
this year as compared to, numbers
in the mid 30’s -during the last two

, seasons.

This in no way means that the

5,1961 frosh -football team‘ will be

weak, but it does prove that the

, Panthers are having some trouble

getting ‘players due to their high
academic standards.

Such outstanding football talent
as Tom Krzemienski of Beaver
Falls, Curtis Vick of Braddock and
Ted Harris of Westinghouse would

have been unable to attend Sky-   ”

scraper U. if they had desired ad-
mission.

Coach Bill Kaliden is quick to
point out however, that “quality
wise We have as good a team as
ever although I will admitiwe are

Bmintrusts Belt Dummies. ».
* ‘I *
As an indication of the type of
players the football team is get-

lacking somewhat in quantity.”
Perhaps Director of Admis-

frosh gridders have entered. They
are all either pre-med, pre-dental,
law or engineering students.
Regardless of the kind of stu-
dents they are, it all boils down
to one thing as Kaliden puts it,
“if they like to hit like last year’s
team we’ll be in good shape.”

“It Goes On . . . ”

(Continued from Page 6)
yeomplexioned, with six pair of eyes and a heart‘. that wouldn’t lie.
“I was a. typical little Jewish boy who got a. sucker from
i his mom whenever he wanted one,” Goldberg confessed. “I went
to day camps and all that stuff. I was a real mess, fat and sloppy.”

“I’ve never hadmore than two ﬁghts in my life and none of
them was signiﬁcant enough to say that I even won or lost.” He
ifeinted with ﬂailing arms to show the absurdity of his ﬁsticuff
experiences. “We’d ﬁght like this. I only wish that more kids would
have really kicked the hell outta me when I was young.”

Another Ponfius Pilaf-e

Goldberg was frantically washing his hands. He wasn’t using
soap and water, of course, but he was simply going through the
motions of purging himself of any associated guilt.

“All my life I have thought that I would be as good as my
father, but I can’t even beat out the other fellows on my team,”
he said. “Chances of my. topping my. father are about a billion
to one. But I want to be the greatest.”

“I didn’t have to come to Pitt. But I have some friends around
here. I ﬁgured that at least they would be hoping for me, at least
they would be sympathetic.” ‘ .

“I just don’t have that“Mike Ditka meanness.’ But I have as
much desire as anyone. But when I try to block a guy, I don’t try

out the recruiting difficulty.

“Every year we ﬁnd thatwe are

going into deeper competition

with the Ivy League schools for
’ athletes.”

to kill him, just knock him down.”

I Desires Respect

Goldberg said this almost apologetically. He is a slap blocker
with the impact of a feather duster, and it haunts his mind. “I
thought thecoaches were calling me ‘chicken’ sometimes for miss-
ing blocks, as if I were ‘doggin’ it. Sometimes I felt just like I was
dirt on their cleats or something.”

Goldberg has palatable verbal reﬁnement. How to win and in-
ﬂuence friends? Marshall could give Dale Carnegie a few, lessons.
But he has failed to win and inﬂuence the friends he craves most—
his teammates. “‘I want their respect,” he said.

Some solace may be offered Goldberg from a poem which his
own father authored in a ‘journalism class at Pitt. He ﬁrst “got that
way about writing poetry” when he met up with Notre D.ame’s
Shakespeare. The last eight lines of “Red-Dawg, Forgotten Gridman,”
are reprinted here: ‘

Fans forget how they gained,
Yes, in less than a year,

He’s ahead of those halfbacks,
Who scored in the game,

For he’ll know how to work,
While they loaf on lost fame.

Thus “Biggie” sympathized with the substitute, the bench-
warmer. His boy is such. But he is a fine boy, that is enough. He
is the kind of son that Jock Sutherland would have been proud to
claim as his own.

 

“Station Systern”

Higher Standards Cause

By ED HOWARD
With two outdoor practices
completed, Panther soccer
coach, Lemis Bemis has de-
cided that his newly-installed
“station system” of practice
is a booming success.

Under the new setup, players
make their own way through a
series of 14 “stations.” At each
one they perform a different drill,
anything ranging from warmup
calisthenics, to dribbling, to prac-
ticing heading the ball through a

.makeshift pipe goal.

Why the new system? “There
are two basic factors; to be con-
sidered in laying outian effective
practice schedule,” says Bemis.
“These are team conditioning and
the development of specialized
skills by the individual players.
The ‘station system’ lets the boys
do the most possible work in
these two areas.”

Bemis got the idea several years
ago from some English visitors
who used a similar setup for gym-
nastics. Of course, there are the
conventional full-team drills fol-
lowing the new workouts. Here
the men integrate their newly-

V college so soon,

Early Admission Plan
Continues Popularity

By JIM NELSON 3

How would you like to have
ﬁnished college at the age of 19,
prepared to continue study for a

,masters degree or equipped to en-

ter the business world two or
three years before the average
college graduate?

This has been possible since
1959 when 13 early admission stu-
dents entered the University as
freshmen from their junior year
in high school. The carefully
screened test students ‘were given
the same rights and privileges as
any entering freshmen. The idea
was that they be completely inte-
grated into the student body.

This first test group was
cessful without exception, en-
couraging the University to con-
tinue and broaden the early ad-
mission program. In the fall of
1960, 18 females and one male
were admitted on this basis.

This time, however, the suc-
cess was not complete. Several
students found difficulty either
in social or academic programs
and seemed to regret coming to

according to
Bernard Adams, special assistant
to the chancellor.

This year the requirements have
been made more stringent to pre-
vent reoccurrence of past mis-
takes. The student must have a
colleg board score average of 600,

SLIC-

with an excellent high school re-

cord. The majority of the 1961
early admission students are in

the upper percent of their junior‘

class.

They are a group of 12 students,
five men and six women, from
different high school»s—eight from
Allegheny County, one from
Maryland, one from New Jersey,

Had a mind that was keen and so last!
when the sirens’ attraction

Drove his men to distraction,

lie just stapled them all to the mast!
