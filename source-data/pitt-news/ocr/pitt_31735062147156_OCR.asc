G. B. Shaw Play,
‘Candida,’ Slated
For February 19

Minister’s, Poet’s Battle For Love
Theme Of Second Production;
Rehearsals On In Earnest

Rehearsals for- “Candida,” three-act
play by the ﬁery Irishman George
Bernard Shaw, have begun on a three-
night-a-week schedule. February 19
has been deﬁnitely set as the date for
presentation of the play, says Carl
B. Cass, faculty director of Pitt
Players.

In the cast are Louise McKirdy,
C36, Herrymon Maurer, C36, Marquis

Patterson, C36, Betty Knop, C37,
Charles Blaker, E37, and William
Kunkel, C39.

Louise McKirdy portrays Candida,
wife of the Reverend James Mavor
Morell, a beautiful -woman in her
early thirties with a strong maternal
instinct‘ that prompts her to take
_under her sheltering wing, in addition
to her husband, one Eugene March-
-banks, poet extraordinary. Morell .is
played by Herrymon Maurer and
Marchbanks by Marquis Patterson.

A Mere Youth
‘ Marchbanks is a mere,Youth—-—only
'18 years old. But-he is already used
to the “slings and arrows of out-.
rageous fortune.” He is possessed of
a peculiar, disconcerting frankness
that prompts him, shy and retiring as
he is, to tell the Reverend James
Morell he is a pompous ass and not
worthy of so ﬁne a wife as Candida. 3

Marchbanks, of course, considers
himself the ideal man._ He-‘and Can-
dida (he has already committed the
impertinence of calling her by her
ﬁrst name) understand one another.
They would get along admirably to-
gether. So the youthful poet begs
Pastor James to make a gracious exit.

Pastor James at ﬁrst. laughs. The
idea is preposterous. He tells March-
banks all men fall in love with his
wife. He doesn’t mind; it only makes
him appreciate her the more. ‘

But Marchbanks gets more and
more downright insulting. There is a
limit to all things, and in time the
Reverend James loses his head. He
angri»ly='clutehes=th'e‘°poet-by“the collar
and threatens, not at all gently, to
knock the presumptuous young thing
into something resembling a cocked
hat, and calls him a “little sniveling
cowardly whelp.” Marchbanks recoils
and cries, “Let me alone. Don't touch
me!” The physical advantage is
clearly on the side of the pastor.

But Marchbanks seems to have the
moral advantage. He succeeds in
making the minister doubt the secur-
ity of his place in the affections of his
wife.

But Affairs. Develop

Matters eventually come to a
head, and Candida is asked to choose
between the two. She reprimands
both, telling the poet he is a “bad
boy.” Evidently, she has never been
aware of the presence of a “problem.”
She has known all along the state of
her own mind, if not theirs. So. things
are adjusted very easily, after all.

Other characters in the play are:
Miss Proserpine Garnett, played by
Betty Knop, who is a plain, efficient
little typist harassed by a romantic
affection for her employer, the Rev-
erend James Morell; Mr. Burgess, 21
“man of sixty, made coarse by the
compulsory selfishness of petty com-
merce,” played by Charles Blaker;
and the Reverend Alexander Mill, who
is magnanimously offering the East
End of London the beneﬁt of his uni-
versity training, played by William
Kunkel.

‘Y Boys Leave Home’ is No Myth,  
Whole Outfit Moves Into Cathedral

It’s ﬁfth hour at the Y hut——a
month, a year, ﬁve years ago.

Near the door, a concerto of the lat-
est jazz, today it would be music
goin’ round and round, is drummed
out on the battered red piano by a
pianist who stops to pull out the keys
that stick. Students sit around the
tables eating lunches and sipping
chocolate milk from half-pint bottles.
The pointed billiard stick meets the
white ball with a, crack and sends it
to smash into the "blue and yellow
ones that spin about on the green-
topped table.

At a corner of one of the tables,
an engineer works away at an algebra
problem. Coats are piled up on the
back of the sofas, on the tables, and‘
draped over chairs. Bill Mendenhall
calls the freshmen into a lon.g room
for the regular freshman Monday.
Luncheon fllub. Two .studen.ts sit
motionless, staring at the pieces on a
red and black -chess board.

There is the click, click of the white
ping pong ball being slapped across
the table, and ‘then, one of the play-
ers crawling underneath the chairs
recovering it. ” Handclapping comes
from the luncheon room as the week’s
speaker is introduced. A conversa-
tion ﬁlls. the room with loud voices,
The piano goes on, the noisy jollity
goes on,. and the rtimegoes on;

Today the Y Hut’s the same building
externally, but inside all is changed.
The curtainless windows let in- the
light to an empty room. The piano
concerto is quiet; there is no slap of
the ping-pong ball, no clock of the
billiard cue, no -chess match, no

luncheon meeting,
high, no voices.

The Y was officially moved into
Room 801, Cathedral, on January 6,
ten years and a day after its moving
into the Hut.

Since 1925, the little building grad-
ually grew to be the center of stu-
dent activities, and only in the last
few years were they gradually moved
to less crowded quarters. The Pan-
ther, Owl, and The Pitt Weekly offices
were all located there at one time.
The old office of the Panther is still
there, papered with covers from ex-
change magazines from other schools,
and one of the rooms still bears the
inscription “Journalism Department.”
For years, the rollicking chorus of Cap
and Gown did -its preliminary prac-
tice at the Hut and caused the _ﬂoor
to give and _crack. When the boys’
went into their routine, one of them-
recalls, they thought the building
would tumble down from the vibra-
tion. .

All of the Hut’s occupants even down
to Toney, the janitor, who spent his
time picking up the cardboards of Mrs.
Lane's lunches and went to sleep dur-
ing evening Pi Tau Phi meetings
have‘ moved out.

William W. Mendenhall, executive
secretary of the YMCA, says that the
move———only atemuporary one-—has
made- necessary the disposal of the
Luncheon Clubs, ping pong, billiards.
general recreation, and the fellowship
groups. However, Bill is happy that_
the Y is‘ located where‘ it is closer‘
to the student‘ center and a. place
where- the organization is able to
contact more people.

Professors Return, Report
Varied Convention Activities

 

By Chester Harris

Members of the departments of So-
cial Science who attended the various
professional.conferences held over the
Christmas holidays reported their ﬁnd-
ings to the fourth regular meeting of
the Social Science Seminar, Friday
afternoon, in the private dining room
of the Faculty Club.

Dr. Oliver Reiser, associate profes-
sor of philosophy and chairman of the
seminar, opened the meeting and after
telling its purpose immediately called
upon the speakers. Dr. Manuel C.
Elmer, professor and head of the De-
partment of Sociology and Director of
division of social work, asked Dr. Neva
Deardorf_ professor of sociology at C0-
lumbia University, to present the re-
port of his department. Dr, Deardorf
pointed out that from the conference
in this ﬁeld, she believed that sociol-
ogists were rapidly coming into pos-
session of an “expanding body of in-
formation about community life.” She
explained that this information was
both purposeful and directful and
named several studies which she de-
scribed as helpful. Among these were
the Vvickersham Crime Report, and
the White House Conference on Child
Health.

At the conclusion of Dr. Deardorf’s
report, Dr, Charles-Tippetts, dean of
the School of Business Administration,-
addressed-the seminar in behalf of the
department‘ or» economics. Dean Tip-.
Detts -remarked‘ that he-hadrbeen dis-.,
appointed -w.ith-the--’con'vention he at-
tetitiedu fl-Ie,-.;,rema1jked.. that .. there had-

sentiment and conservatism. He sug-
gested to his listeners that speakers
such as Mr. Tugwell, undersecretary
of the Department of Agriculture,
were decreasing in popularity and
probably would continue to do so until
the next depression. Dr. Francis Ty-
son, professor of economics, took op-
position to the report of Dean Tippetts,
stating that the conference in his
opinion had been very progressive and
possibly radical. He also mentioned
that social control seemed to be an un-
derlying issue of the conference.

The conference of the American His-
torical Association was summarized
by Dr. N. Andrew N. Cleven, professor
of history, who presented the program
of the meeting and remarked on the
usual interest displayed by the dele-
gates and the large attendance. Dr.
E. Douglas Branch, research professor
of history. also spoke for the Depart-
ment of History.

Dr. Richard Hope, associate pro-fes—
sor of philosophy, told the seminar
that there were ﬁve main topics dis-
cussed at the department of philoso-
phy’s convention. These were: “The
Min-d and Body Problem,” “The Phil-
osophy of History,” “The Philosophy
of Plato,” “Symbolic Logic,” “Philoso-
phical Implications of Probability.”

The annual convention of the Amer-
ican Political Science Association was
discussed by Dr, ‘Roger V. Shumate,
instructor in political science, who
said that some weak and ineffectual

papers had been prese_nted‘but.stated - -

‘The [Music Goes
’Round’——1f Prom

Dancers SaySo

Jack Miles has faithfully promised
to play “The Music Goes ’Round and
’Round” at the Junior Prom, if enough
people make known. such a request‘.-

Unless, of course, you do11’t want
him to play it; in which case, he has
faithfully promised not to play “The
Music Goes ’Round and ’Round.”

For Miles and his Band of Bands
liave wisely remained immune, ad-
vance releases tell us, from the novel-
ty rage that seems to take hold of so
many‘ bands.

He plays a marked dance tempo
(tempo Lombardian) with delicate
shadings of his own individual ar-
rangements-.

Moreover, the band, featured over
both NBC and CBS networks and on
the Lucky Strike program, brings with
excellent vocalists and
.l'ack’s ow-n smooth brand of trombone
solos.

You must know already that the
formal dance takes place Friday night
from 10 to 2 o'clock in the Hotel
Schenley ballroom; tickets may be
purchased for $3 from committee
members announced on the bill-
boards; the name of the dance is the
Junior Prom.

For Males Only

With a few sly digs at the faculty
and a number of rapier-thrusts into
the already mutilated body of mid-
semester examinations, the 1936 mod-
el of the Panther will appear on the
ca.mp-us Wednesday.

Miss Irene Matveak, C37, is the
young lady who goes atilting with

scholastic -forces in her article, “A
System for Professors.”
That Pitt Pourri columnist, Ben

Baskin, C37, has some things to say
“For Men Only.” It is rumored, and
the rumor has not been checked as to
sources, that Mr. Baskin’s article
will spill a few hitherto-unknown facts
about certain campus luminaries——or
is it “luninaries?’ The editors 01’ the
Panther, and this is conﬁdential, are
looking for an increase in circulation
because of an anticipated increase in
feminine purchasers. But, well—“the
event.”

If you want to get a look-in on the
mental workings of great minds, Miss
Bernice =Goldman’s article “Interview
With a Genius” is the source You must
consult. _

As usual, four outstanding students
will have their secrets bared in the
VVho’s VVho section. Milton Lehman,
C38; Charles D. Miller, C38; and Alan
Lloyd, C36, will also be represented
among the contributors.

In addition there will be cartoons.

Student Faculty Assembly will be
prepared to listen to and discuss any-
where from one to 15 committee
reports, as the ﬁrst month of activity
for newly created working groups
draws to a close.

According to the agenda for tomor-
row’s meeting, issued by VVilliam Har-
vey. Q36, chairman of SFA, each new
committee chairman will be asked for
a report or account of the activities of
his commi.ttee,'but “it is impossible
to state which committee will be able
to make complete reports.”

Any student of the University will
have the privilege of speaking from
the ﬂoor for the ﬁrst time tomorrow
evening. Recognition by the chair
is necessary. This measure was ap-
proved‘ by a close vote at the last reg-
ular meeting of SFA on December 10.

Also to be passed upon is the exec-
utive committee's plan of procedure
for the recognition of new organiza-
tions. This plan was put in its pres-

tion of all ﬁfth hour classes, co-chair-
men of the committee in charge, Ro-
berta Nern, E36, and Lois Follansbee,

ing showed the group evenly divided
on the subject, and consultation with
J. G. Quick, registrar, was advised.

First on the agenda are scheduled
reports of committees working under
and in conjunction with the executive
committee. These include the social
committee, headed by William Mc-
Quade, E37, the appointments commit-
tee, headed‘ by Charles Allcroft, C37,
and the organizations committee, the
work- of which is at present being
handled by the executive committee.

Oldbusiness to be brought up, ac-
cording to members of SFA, include
the questions of why steps have not
been built behind Heinz House, and
why hat and coat racks have not been
placed at vantage points in Alumni
Hall, as agreed upon during earlier
meetings of the assembly.

And, as the agenda says: “If you
have been asked to do any work or
make any investigations, be prepared
to present both a written and an oral
report.”

Chairmen of the 15 committees who
will be asked to report are:' Charles
Hera.ld, C36, of the forum committee;
David Racusin, C37, of the Sub-Fresh-
man Day committee; Herrymon Maur-

Business Opens
Year With Gains

District Recovers From Decrease
Made In Final Week Of 1935

Business in the Pittsburgh. district
last week recovered most of the de-
crease recorded in the final week of
1935, according to the weekly sum-
mary of business conditions issued
Thursday by the Bureau of Business
Research.

Expanded industrial production ac-
counted for the major part of the rise
in the index last week. The index of
iron and steel production rose from
70.4 to 77.6. This index means that
the steel industry was operating in
the ﬁrst week of 1936 at 78 per cent
of normal for that week. Industrial
electric power production and coal
production showed moderate increases
for the Week. Originating shipments
also increased moderately last week
owing to decided gains in shipments
of coal.

The Bureau also announced in its
“Monthly Summary” that while the
course of business in the district was
upward during 1935 the movement of
the index was extremely erratic. In
the ﬁrst nine months, the index mov-
ed’ sharply upward _ three different
times, only to reverse the trend-and
lose the-. gains. The current -rise, how-
ever,‘ which began early: in-‘- October
has carried 1 the 1 index to‘ the «higihest
levels-‘since"ear,ly':ir£ -1931. -.1 ., ' :

Grand1nother’s Lesson

NOE AGAIN WE SWING into the home

0 stretch of the ﬁnal two weeks before examin-

ations and the end of the semester. Now is

the time for the great army of average students to

roll up its sleeves, sharpen its pencils, and get to
work.

'1‘o be sure, there are some among us who aren’t
looking forward to anything of the sort. These are
the hardy souls who found the sun of September
not too inviting, the mellowness of October not too
distracting, and the heavily loaded social calendar
of November and December not too diverting.
Blessed indeed are these, for they are not many.

The others of us are_ busily engaged in a re-
trenchment from activities calculated to bring us
out of the woods by January 28. Then, too, one
must remember, it is term paper time. The lines
at the library become longer, pencil-sharpeners are
overworked, and the added consumption of ink
brings joy to the hearts of the manufacturers.

It has never been discovered if there is some rule
prohibiting term papers from being written before
the last month of the term. A wise idea might be
to stagger the assignments of these papers. For
instance, history papers might be assigned one
month, English papers the next, and so on. Then
again, that might not be practical, or the profes-
sors may ha.ve learned that everyone waits until
the last weeks to do the papers anyway.

Therefore we will now be engaged in a series of
almost sleepless nights, cups of black coffee, initial
cracking of the book in the course, and concerted
sorties against the library attendants, who some-
how manage to live through it. There are many
students who will assure you that the last minute
policy is as good as any. There are many who
enjoy “bearing down” at the eleventh hour and
feel a great personal satisfaction as each piece of
work comes elf the assembly line closer and closer
to the deadline, circles under the eyes and an in-
crease of classroom snoozes regardless.

This is not intended in any way to change the
habits of the universal University student. It has
been going on this way for too long a time to sup-
pose that any written words will convince students
to spread their work over a larger working period.
No matter how black we might paint the picture of
the ﬁnal two hectic weeks, we wouldn’t dare to say
that it might cause even one person to do consist-
ent studying right from the beginning of next
semester.

Thus endeth grandmother’s lesson for today.

The acme of something or other was reached
Friday when someone called the ofﬁce of our next
door neighbor, the Pitt Panther, and asked if he
might borrow the Panther skin!

A Little Stranger-—Than Fiction

An early morning event recently threw members liv-
ing in the Kappa Kappa Gamma. house at Ohio State into
consternation. While eating breakfast, the girls were
attracted to the back yard by strange noises coming
from the roof of their house. There they were startled
to see a big bird, with a very long bill, standing on one
long leg on the edge of the chimney and making what-
ever kind of noises that particular bird makes.

Immediately the girls began to look at one another
suspiciously. Finally, one had the brilliant idea of call-
ing the local ﬁre department to get the bird down. A
ﬁre laddy went up a.nd retrieved the long-billed fellow
without objections from the billbous one.

Upon closer scrutiny of the bird, everyone seemed
quite relieved to learn it was only a blue heron, which
had escaped from a local zoo.

Letter To The Editor

Editor, The Pitt‘ News:

Alliance’s aims anything substantially

cast reﬂections on SFA; and SFA

Although I am not a member of Stu-
den\‘. Alliance group, and have no
present intentions of joining, I feel
that it has not been given exactly a
square deal by the SFA Executive
Committee and Assembly.

Undoubtedly SFA acted’ within its
jurisdiction in refusing to consider
the recent application for a charter
submitted by the Student Alliance.
SFA refused to consider the applica-
tion because it was not properly pre-
sented (i. e.) it lacked two faculty
sponsors); for this reason SFA, in
effect, refused Student Alliance a
University Charter.

There are two opinions on this mat-
ter: ﬁrst that SFA had no choice but
to return the application for its fail-
ure to comply with the customary
regulations. Second, SFA could ex-
ercise its own judgment concerning
applications; this is the opinion that
the weight of precedent is behind.
However. if the ﬁrst opinion be true,
then SFA has acted correctly; but
if the other be true, then SFA has
something to explain. Incontroverti-
bly, then. in this situation SFA
thought Student Alliance was not
worthy of a charter. If so, why? The

technical disqualiﬁcation is merely
incidental.

F“-or" what I know of Student Alli-
ance, I can understand that there

might be objection to it: but I have
yet to hear of an objection valid or
strong enough to refuse official rec-
ognition.

“To crystallize and integrate stu-
dent opinion” is part of the avowed
purpose of this group. I fail to ﬁnd
in this or in other parts of Student

dissimilar to the programs of other
campus organizations (of similar na-
ture) already organized. Obviously
the desire of the Student Alliance is to
form a more or less permanent asso-
ciation in which students, not nec-
essarily members of Student Alliance,
could discuss in their own fashion cur-
rent social questions with a deter-
mination to achieve a comprehensive
and a. just viewpoint concerning these
things; and possibly in the interests
of truth or intellectual curiosity to
bring before the group as guest speak-
ers men and women qualiﬁed to speak
on these things.

Few of us will deny that crystalliz-
ing and integrating student opinion on
a campus is a necessary corollary to
formal class instruction; to deny that
would be to set one’s own opinion
Quixote-like against the seasoned
judgments of scholars the world over.
If SFA does not think that Student
Alliance is capable of performing this
function it should say so deﬁnitely:
that alone would prove that SFA is
acting on evidence and not on whim.

If SFA considers the program of
Student Alliance to be an unnecessary
duplication of work already carried
on by other campus bodies it shoutd
say so. However, there is more than
reasonable doubt that such a position
would be difficult to maintain.

Some members of Student Alliance
claim that there have been instances
where SFA has not enforced the char-
ter regulations to the limit in each
particular, but that in the case of
Student Alliance the regulations were
enforced to the hilt. I do not know
how true these charges are, but they

must reply, for the charges cannot be.
dismissed lightly as absurd.

If Student Alliance resubmits its
application for a charter, as I think
it will, SFA should pass upon that ap-
plication quickly. But SFA should
consider the matter on a broad and
intelligent basis, not upon unim-
portant technicalities. If SFA should
decide not to grant the charter, the
grounds for the refusal should be
given explicitly. And those grounds
should be substantial grounds.

By Sam Williams
Making scientiﬁc instruments that
are accurate to a millionth of an inch
is an every day task of the Gulf Re-

search Laboratory at Harmarville, ac-
cording to R. J. S. Piggott, head of
the laboratory. He spoke at the com-
bined AE-ME seminar Thursday.

An example of the precision is the
surfacing of metal blocks to a smooth-
ness measured by the wave length of
infra-red rays. Two of these blocks.
which are parts of delicate instru-
ments used in detecting oil ﬁelds,
could not be separated when placed
together because of the cohesive
forces of such smooth surfaces.

The gravity pendulum is one of the
instruments constructed here. Time
of completion is no objective in its
manufacture and one of these instru-
ments cost nearly $10,000.

This delicate instrument operates
in a high vacuum and is so well con-
structed that, although it has many
complicated parts, the vacuum will
remain unaffected for weeks. VVhen
the pendulum is set in motion. it has
a swing of six centimeters. Four or
ﬁve hours later, it makes an arc of
about four centimeters. This shows
its perfect construction because there
is no machinery operating this pen-
dulum, as it depends ‘entirely upon
gravity for its motion.

The gravity pendulum and many
other instruments are used for locat-
ing oil pockets. According to Mr. Pig-
gott, a truck, complete in every re-
spect even to the installation of a
short wave radio set for use in com-

municating with ﬁeld parties, is sent
out to some region which they wish
to study. Here gravity pendulums.
seismographs, and other instruments
are set up, tests made, and “math
more complicated than that studied in
college” is used. The result is a rec-
ord showing the characteristics of the
ﬁeld. From these records, a geologist
ca11 usually determine whether oil or
gas is present,

By the use of scientiﬁc instruments
instead of the method used in “wild-
cat days,” it is possible to predict the
presence of three out of four wells.
Back in the days of chance and the
divining rod, only one out of four sites
ever yielded oil or gas. As the cost
of drilling such wells often runs into
six ﬁgures, the advantages of the
more accurate method can be easily
seen.

Mr. Piggott also explained the cause
of the trouble experienced when
cadmium plated bearings were used
in automobile engines. This trouble,
which necessitated the replacement
of hearings in many ca.rs several
years ago, was attributed to the high
grade oil which had just been placed
on the market. It seemed that the
users of cheaper priced oils were not
affected.

It ﬁnally developed that because of
the high speed of motors (4,500-5,000
r. p. m.) and the inadequacy of pres-
ent oil systems when such speeds
were attained, the oil was frothed un-
til no lubrication reached the bear-
ings. The moral: there is a demand
for a scientiﬁc oiling system; hence,
a ﬁeld for mechanical engineers.

Faculty Triumphs
In Bridge Match

Defeats Students In Team-of-20
Tournament Thursday Night

By a score of 51%, to 48%, the fac-
ulty bridge team defeated the stu-
dents in a team-of-20 match Thurs-
day night.

The tournament, held in the confer-
ence room in Room 801, Cathedral,
featured the regaining of their laurels
by a previously defeated team of fac-
ulty members which came through at
the right moments to win.

Although the faculty piled up the
greater total, a student team of four
consisting of Leonard Seder, C37,
Frank Hockensmith, E36, William
Sprague, E37, and Arthur Sachs, C39,
had the highest rating with 15 out of
a possible 20 points.

Following closely with 14% points
was the top faculty team of Mr. Claude
W. VVoodsi_de, instructor in commercial
education; Dr. John J. G‘eise,.assist-
ant professor of history; Dr. Gebhard
Stegeman, professor of chemistry;
and Dr. Jules Labarthe, Senior Indus-
trial Fellow of the Mellon Institute.

The evening’s play was dotted with
freak and colorful hands, one of which
was void in two suits. The chances
are, according to Seder, about 8280 to
one against such a hand appearing.

Faculty members competing besides
Mr. Woodside, Dr. Stegeman, Dr. Geise,
and Dr. Labarthe include: Dr. James
S. Taylor, professor of mathematics;
Mr, J, (Howard Dice, University libra-
rian; Captain Donald C. Tredennick,
assistant professor of military science
and tactics; Mr. Stephen J. Tracy, in-
structor in mechanical engineering.

Mr, Vvilliam J , Martin. assistant pro-
fessor of history; Dr. Mont R. Gabbert,
professor and head of the department
of philosophy; Dr. Vvilfred N. St.
Peter professor of physics; Mr, Mar-
tin J. Feely, assistant professor of
physical education; Mr. Theodore A.
Siedle, assistant professor of educa-
tion; John Harpster, graduate assist-
ant in history.

Mr. Reginald H, Johnson, assistant
professor of modern languages; Mr.
Robert F. Edgar, assistant professor
of civil engineering; and Mr. John
Dambach, professor of education and
director of courses in physical educa-
tion.

Irish Continue To Hold Field

Goal Complex

Over Panthers

 

Big Last Half Rally G-ives

Notre Dame 43-35 Victory;

Nowak Stars For Victors, Roderick For Pitt

 

By Harry E. Robinson ,

Mr. Marty Peters, the gentleman from Notre Dame who sunk the Panther
gridders with a ﬁeld goal last fall, didn’t bother the cagers at all last Fri-
day night at the Stadium, but he had ﬁve or six teammates who did. As a
result the Pitt cagers suffered their second straight loss, bowing before a
whirlwinll second half attack by the Irish to lose, 43-35.

A near-capacity crowd watched Coach Carlson's boys come from behind
in the ﬁrst half to take the lead at the midway point by a 20-19 score, in-

crease
during the ﬁrst part of the second
half. and fade before a deluge of
buckets from Nowak, Moir, and Wuko-
witz in the closing minutes of play.

This setback broke the spell which
the Carlsonmen have held over the
Irish in the last four starts between
the two clubs, but it took a good
Notre Dame quintet to do the trick.

As in the Tech game where the
name Greenberg was sounded fre-
quently, that of another one was add-
ed to the list of Pitt nuisances, that
of Tom Nowak, tall gangling center
from South Bend, who dropped in
seven ﬁeld goals and a pair of free
throws, accounting for more than one-
third of the Irish total. Captain Ted
Roderick sunk ﬁve beauties for run-
ner-up honors in individual scoring.

Field goals by Meyer and Nowak-'
sent the Ramblers off to a 6-0 lead at
the beginning, before Pete Noon toss-
ed a ﬁeld goal. More two-pointers
by Nowak, Moir, and Wade gave the
big boys from the midwest a 12-2 lead
with about nine minutes in the first
half played.

Roderick replaced Loucks and his
pair of baskets, along with a long one
by Radvansky and a foul shot by
Noon brought the score up to 15-9,
Meyer having hit the hoop for two
points and Nowak contributing a foul
for Notre Dame.

Radvansky |H'elps Close Gap

Rags Radvansky went on a scoring
spree to close up the gap. tallying six
points shortly before the half-time
whistle blew. Garcia made the score
16-11, and Radvansky ran the count
to 17-16 with two goals and a foul.
Bob Johnson, who played a ﬁne de-
fensive game for Pitt, turned in a
foul shot to even matters at 17-all,
but Nowak with another two-plyer
gave the lead back to Notre Dame. A
beautiful long shot from the center
by Roderick tied the score a 19-all,
and Radvansky’s penalty ﬂing allowed
the Panthers to go to their dressing
rooms sporting a 20-19 lead.

With six minutes gone in the ﬁnal
half. Zeleznick had run the count to
28-21 with a ﬁeld goal and four free.
throws, and it looked as if the Irish
were going to need more than ﬁeld
goals to win. Five minutes later the
score stood at _29-2_8__ in the visitor's
favor, with Nowak, Ford, and Moir be-
ing responsible for the change.

Johnson’s one-handed shot gave
Pitt the lead for the last time in the
ball game. Field goals by Nowak.
Moir. and Wokewitz ran the score up

’ to 43 in spite of Roderick. Noon, and

Johnson's ﬁve points which gave the
Panthers their 35-total.

Coach George Koegan of Notre
Dame had a difficult time sticking to
his allotted space on the bench, time
and time getting to his feet to give
the referee a piece of his mind, to yell
at Nowak, or to keep the timekeepers
on their toes. To prevent any recur-
rence of a “long count,” Coach Carl-
son selected Joe Bach to watch the
minutes of the meeting.

Chem Engineers Win
Title Defeating EES

-Chemical engineers evidently know
how to mix acids with ﬁeld goals, for
they copped the School of Engineer-
ing title by defeating the Electrical
Engineers, 44-17. The game topped
the card on the annual smoker held
last Thursday in Trees Gymnasium.

Tiinmins and Rosckowski were high
point men for the winners while On-
cha, Harry, and McDonald played
best for the losers. The CEs were de-
fending champs.

The Chems advanced to the ﬁnals
by beating the Industrial Engineers’
team, and the Electricals arrived at
the last bracket by virtue of a for-
feit.

Helm and Timmons, forwards,
Smith at center, Rosckowski and Petri
at guards made up the Chem quintet.
For the losers, Oncha, Macaluso,
Walker, McDonald, Hinkey, and Harry
formed the team.

to be head and shoulders above the
other ﬁve ﬁnal prospects on the basis
of a terriﬁc last-lap quarter that al-
most nipped Fred Kiger in the home
stretch to erase a 25-yard handicap
in Friday's time-trials.

Kiger, ex-captain and former star
4-40-yard dashman, ﬁnished a 3:38
mile on a lead that was built up
mainly through the efforts of Andy
Lasky, Jim McConnell, and Johnny
Vvoodruff, freshman. The tentative
“varsity” lineup which suffered a de-
feat by a scant yard included James
Van Kennen. Art Thomas, Charles
Groat. and Connelly. It was called
“varsity” only in name since both
Lasky a.nd McConnell rate at least on
a par with this quartet, excepting the
standout, Connelly.

Coach Olson after Friday's try-outs
classed Connelly, Groat, Thomas, Mc-
Connell, Lasky, and Van Kennen in a
sextet from which he will probably
pick the four starting positions for the
Millrose classic.

Lasky Takes Lead

Lasky stepped out immediately for
the “varsity” to lead Van Kennen by
several yards on the ﬁrst of the three-
lap “quarter-mile” in the Track House.
Van Kennen’s pass on the third lap
was poor to Thomas, widening the dis-
tance from one to 16 yards on the‘ mis-
cue. Thomas, however, made up 14
of’ the yards before passing the baton
to Groat with the “varsity” still be-
hind.

Woodruff for the “challengers” in-
creased his lead over Groat in that
thiy-d— “qua;-t.er-” -to--almost 20 ---yards.
Kiger was away like a. ﬂash after the
“pass” for the “challengers.” It-was
here that Connelly caused the 35-odd
candidates in other events to shin‘.
their interest from the pits, shots,
and rope-climbing to shouts of en-
couragement as he slowly ate up the
yardage separating Kiger and him-
self.

He almost made it. but Kiger just
clipped the tape a fraction quicker
than Connelly’s desperate lunge for
the ﬁnish. Olson was pleased with
the workout.

Eugene Taano, versatile Finnish
stylist in the javelin, with marks of
better than 200-feet in this ﬁeld event,
shows promise of developing into a
pole-vaulter of some note. The ‘blond
Taano, hailing from Ashtabula, Ohio.
where he was runner-up in the na-
tional scholastics, looked almost too
husky to pull himself way up there as
a pole-vaulter but he does it.

Swimmers Meet
Delewa re Team

Here On Friday

After getting their ﬁrst taste of
competition on Saturday evening
against the powerful Buckeyes, the
Panther swimmers will spend the next
few days preparing for the opening
meet of the Eastern Intercollegiate
Swimming Association against Dela-
ware here next Friday,

Last season Coach Corr’s natators
sprayed the Delaware lads with a 50-
18 beating, and a victory over the vis-
itors would send the Pitt boys off to a
good start in the battle for league
honors.

Practice sessions will be held from
5 to 7 o'clock on today, tomorrow, and
Thursday afternoons and from 7 to 9
o'clock on VVednesday evening. Sev-
eral of the varsity men failed to re-
port until recently, thus retarding the
conditioning of the team. However,
by Friday, Coach Corr believes that
the Panthers will be able to pit full
strength against the invaders.

Walt Nowotny, freshman star,
paced the ﬁeld in the 220-yard free-
stroke feature on the Senior AMA
swim carnival held Thursday at
Homestead Library. His time was 2
minutes, 31.8 seconds.

Mitt Tournament
Novices To Begin

Entry List Closes Today At Four;
Fun Begins At Same Time

Final work-outs having already
been completed, the 40 or more am-
bitious ringmen who will compete in
the fourth annual intramural boxing
tournament are taking it easy today,
prior to answering the ﬁrst bell at 4
o’clock this afternoon.

Entries are still being accepted at
the Stadium office, and the deadline
will fall at 4, when lots will be drawn
for matches.

Immediately following the drawing,
the weighing-in ceremonies will coni-
mence. All candidates in the 119, 129,
139, and 149-pound classes must be
present. ‘

Climbing over the ropes for the
opening bout will be two 119-pounders.
The remaining preliminary matches
will be completed today and tomorrow
in the Stadium ring. On Wednesday,
the successful survivors will mix it up
in the ﬁnals to determine the winners
of the gold and silver awards.

While the members of Jack
Shricker’s varsity aggregation will not
be eligible to participate, they will
have an active part in the proceed-
ings, anyway. In addition to lending a
hand in running off the elimination
matches, they will be available see-

onds to any contestant who wants a '

man in the corner. -

Conducting the tourney strictly in
accord with the rulings of the Marquis
of Queensberry rounds will consist
of three minutes of action and one-
minute rests.

Would A Few Peeled
Syracuse Oranges Do?

Birthdays usually call for some
sort of presents, celebrations, and
congratulatory messages, but
these are not what Jack Schricker,
head boxing coach, wants for his
next birthday.

Vvhat Coach Schricker wants is
wrapped up in terms of jabs, hooks,
haymakers, and clinches and may
be obtained up in Syracuse, New
York, on January 18. It so hap-
pens that the Pitt boxers meet the
Orange on that date, and Schricker
would like nothing more than a
tidy verdict over the crack Syra-
cuse team for a present.

I~Ie’s reticent about telling how
old he'll be on that day, but he’s
not a bit backward in telling what
he hopes the Pitt boxers to do on
that day. Well,, Christmas only
comes once a year and Santa was
pretty liberal last year, but per-
haps he’ll make a special visit to
Syracuse on the 18th to make
Schricker happy.

job after his absence for a week, the
Panther matmcn are going through
their ﬁnal paces in preparation for

The coach expects to have the team
in top form by Friday night, and fol-
lowing the ﬁnal intra-squad matches
for berths on the varsity, which will
take place this afternoon and tomor-
row afternoon, he will begin the taper-
ing off process.

An important addition was made to
the team last week, when Luther
Richards, varsity football playerand
a winner in last year’s intra-mural
wrestling tourney, reported for the
squad. Richards is entered in the
heavyweight division.

Those trying for positions on the
team are: 118-pound class: Eugene

Freshman Quintet
Shows Excellent
Record For Start

Carrying on from where they left
off last season, Dockey Kowallis and
his Panther freshman team are again
off to another good start and from the
looks of things right now, another
successful season, Thus far this sea-
son, Dockey and the boys have swept
through four games without a. defeat.

In the opening game of the season
the freshies duplicated the feat of
their big brothers, the varsity, and
whipped the Washington and Jeffer-
son ﬁve. During the Christmas vaca-
tion the Cubs defeated the Lennox
Junior College quintet, and on their
return to school won over the Carne-
gie Tech Plebes. On Friday night at
the Stadium they continued their
streak by taking Kiski.

In each of the four games Kowallis
has used a different starting combina-
iion. ;For the most part, though, he
has banked on the ﬁve that started
the Tech game last week as his fresh-
The players used then
were Jack Scott, of Mt. Lebanon, Bill
Bradley of North Braddock, Joe Fable
from ‘East Pittsburgh, George Lind-
sey of Avalon, and Ed Lowry from
Kiski. But as Dr. Carlson is doing
this season, Kowallis has been using
almost his entire squad as substitutes
in every game. Manny Hyatt, Ed So-I
behart, Bob Keene, Jules Rivlin, John-g
ny Smith, Emmett Morrison, and sev-
eral others have seen plenty of ac-
tion as substitutes.

The Panther Cubs have eight more
games scheduled for the remainder of
the season with the possibility of sev-
eral games being added later on.
These will probably be with local and
district high school cage teams.

Next Saturday the Little Panthers
go to State College, along with the
varsity, to meet the State yearlings.
One week later_ the 25th, the Cubs
meet West Virginia on the Stadium
ﬂoor in the preliminary to the Pitt-
Mountaineer varsity drag. February
8th ﬁnds the Pitt freshies down on the
Bluff to face their city rivals, the Duke
fresh, and the 18th has the reverse

of that with the Dukes coming here.

Year"s Activity Average Lower;
-- - Committee Contacts Women
 Who Do Not Participate

'-Seventy-eight and -ﬁve-tenths per-
cent‘ of undergraduate women partic-
ipate in student activities, according
to ﬁgures released by the VVSGA Ac-
tivities committee in its report to the
WSGA Commission on Thursday eve-
ning.

Of that group, 673 by actual count,
there are 256 women who serve on
committees of WSGA. This number
exceeds the number participating in
any other single organization.

"Although the percentage of partici-
pation in activities is higher than that
of colleges comparable to the Uni-
versity, the ﬁgure is much lower than
that of last year, which showed that
slightly over 89 percent of the women
students participated in at least one

activity.
Included in the report. given by
Mary Frances Brice, Ed36, commit-

t'ee._chairma.n. was an account of the
special WSG-A activities ﬁle that. the
committee plans to keep. When com-
plete, the ﬁle will list all undergrad-
uate women who have been contact-
ed“ for work on; any -.VVSGA commit-
tee from the sophomore through the
senior year. .

special ﬁle, are being taken from the
general activities point scale ﬁle
kept by the dean of women’s office.
In addition Senior Court keeps an ac-
tivities eligibility ﬁle. _ L

if According to the chairman. the ac-
tivities committee will attempt to
