 University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Vol. 73, N0. 83

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

The University Senate Council’

yesterday moved to appoint a
search committee, (including at

0 least one woman and one minority

person) to fill vacant or newly
authorized faculty positions.

The resolution, presented by Dr.
Gerald J. Massey of the faculty
section of the University affirma-
tive action committee, states that if
the committee contains no such
women or minorities, it must seek
the assistance of the Director of
Affirmative Action in identifying
such persons.

In other action, the senate voted
to aid Pitt’s "Homecoming
Committee by asking instructors
not to schedule tests and to allow
students to make up work on Oct.
12, the day before Homecoming
and the culmination of a week’s
worth of student activities. Student
government president Stan
Galanski originally requested that
classes be cancelled for the

afternoon to encourage student
participation.

According to Galanski, two years
ago, classes were cancelled at noon
andlast year, when they were not,
it -“somewhat diminished par-
ticipation by students and faculty.”

Galanski also said that the board
has completed distributing

‘allocations for the coming ﬁscal
year, dividing $272,000 among
approximately 50 student
organizations. Galanski said the
board believes that the student
activities fee should be increased.

“I realize that’s something that
has been batted around for years,”
Galanski said. “But there has been
a demise in the quality and
quantity of student organizations.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar said
the university’s budget will r1o‘t be
presented at, today’s board of
trustees meeting as the situation is
still uncertain. Posvar, who
attributed to the 4.5 percent
increase as “the inadvertant result
of money being chewed up by

'© 1979, The Pitt News

inﬂationary increases,” said that
he looked for increased funds from
Harrisburg in the future. .

Posvar also -commented on
students defaulting on state-
guaranteed loans.

“In our case, we have worked
hard to get the number of unsolved
cases down to 18 percent,” said
Posvar. He added that Pitt has
cracked down by increasing its staff
and taking legal action against the
defaulters.

“We. want to get the number
down to 12 percent in the near
future,” said Posvar.

Posvar praised the efforts of the
university’s security staff following
last week’s power outage after
explosions rocked Duquesne light
facilities along Forbes Avenue.

“Our security force did an
extraordinary job,” Posvar said.
“They distributed walkie-talkies to

key personel, set up a command’

post in my office, and in an hour
and a half they evacuated the
campus.”

Pitt’s Campus Nursery

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

In this, the International Year of
the Child, Pitt’s Campus Nursery
Center is thriving and growing,
although a bit hindered by a lack of
publicity. Barb Murphy, director
of the center, said she thinks it is
about time people know that the
school exists.

According to Murphy, the
campus nursery, located at 4100
Aliquippa St.., has more to offer
than most institutions for pre-
school children. The daily schedule
is based on the needs of the
children enrolled in the school,
offering both play and structured
educational activities.

Children attend the Nursery‘
Center from 8:00 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.
five days per week, 46 weeks per
year.

In the morning, children may
freely choose their activities
ranging from puppets, block
building, sand and water play,

. Fits Childrens’ Needs

outdoor activities and art work,
Murphy said.

“Our program provides cogni-
tive experiences by the LRDC
(Learning Research and Develop-
ment Center) in classification,
quantification, and perceptual
motor skills,” Murphy said.

Teachers from _Falk School,
which includes grades kinder-
garten through eighth, teach the
children music and art once a week
and travel to Falk School for weekly
visits to the library and gym,
according to Murphy.

Murphy said the children also
grow socially and emotionally by
interacting with other children of
different races and ethnic groups.

“We try to keep a balance
there,” she said.

The teacher/ child ratio is one to
seven with the addition of three

', more helpers in the fall, the ratio

will be one to five, according to
Murphy.

Pitt’s Board of Trustees, which
has approved tuition increases at
its past four spring meetings, will
table this years’ tuition question
when it meets here tomorrow
afternoon.

The trustees are expected to
schedule approval of Pitt’s 1979-80
budget, and any resulting tuition
hike, for the board’s Executive
Committee meeting in June.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar yes-
terday told Senate Council mem-
bers that until the state budget
situation in Harrisburg‘ becomes
clearer, Pitt’s budget “remains
uncertain.” I

The board’s Budget-Audit Com-
mittee, which normally recom-
mends any raise in tuition at the
May meeting, will “merely report”
the budget situation tomorrow,
Posvar added.

The state legislators, currently

recessed for the primaries, are

unable to agree to Gov. Richard
Thornburgh’s $6.3 billion budget,
which includes . a 4.5 percent
increase in appropriations for Pitt.
Democrats want to out $48 million
from Thornburgh’s budget and
raise appropriations, for state-
related schools to seven percent. If
the General Assembly fails to pass
a budget by the end of the summer,
Pitt could be forced into a situation
similar to two summers ago, when
the university was forced to borrow
money to compensate for lack of
funding.

If the board decides not to
approve the budget tomorrow, that
leaves the ‘June meeting of the

‘ Executive Committee as the last

chance for approval before June 30,
the end of the ﬁscal year.

The committee is composed of

just 12 members, including Posvar,
Board Chairman Roger Ahlbrandt
and Vice Chairman Robert Kirby.
But any board member is permitted

to attend an Executive Committee ,

meeting when an important deci- ‘

sion is to be made.

In addition to delaying approval
of the budget, the trustees are not
expected to render any decision
concerning the Titusville campus
problem.

The ﬁnancially depressed branch
campus was ﬁrst brought to the
attention of the trustees at last
winter’s meeting, when Posvar
stated that a committee, headed by
Provost Rhoten Smith, had been
formed to investigate the campus.

The committee reported in March F

that a preliminary study of

Titusville indicated the school may L

have to be closed.

“There is enough evidence to
warrant closing, the campus,”
Robert Nossen, associate provost of
regional campuses, said at the
time.

But university officials said this
week the campus was “still under

Successful Child Care Center Based on Parent input

(Con rinuedfrom page 1)

Currently, there are four
teachers and a child care worker to
attend to the 30 children enrolled in
the nursery center, said Murphy.

Murphy called the school a

success, based upon parental
evaluations of the program.

“Parents indicate it is a good
program and have recommended
the nursery school to their
friends,” he said.

Not only is the program good for
pre-school children, it provides
good practical experience for
college students interested in the
ﬁeld, according to Murphy.

Strong Turnout For ‘Short Eyes’

By MARK HOLAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
Carnegie-Mellon University’s
Department of Drama completed a

  highly successful seven perfor-

mance run of “Short Eyes” this
weekend at Theater Express.

The play had originally been
scheduled to run only four nights.

; Three additional performances

were added, however, because of
strong turn-outs.

“Short Eyes,” a prison term‘ for
a child rapist, won the New York
Inner Circle Drama Award in 1974.

The play, written by Miguel
Pinero, deals with a group of young
convicts and their harsh reaction
when such an offender comes into
their prison block.

In addition to their performances
at Theater Express, CMU also took
their production to the Youth
Development Center, a maximum
security juvenile unit in New

Castle. Although there was jeering ,

and heckling at the beginning, the
80 inmates in attendance (all
seeing a staged play for the first
time) eventually settled down and
became captivated by the drama.

Bill Cosby tells
why Red Cross needs
your type of blood.

“Every day of the week,
there’s somebody who needs
your type of blood.

“But the thing about blood
is: it doesn’t keep very long.
Which means we’ve got to
keep the supply coming con-
stantly. Donors are needed
every day.

“Sorry to say, there are
never enough donors.

“In fact, five people out of
every I00 are doing the whole

job. That’s right, five percent
of the people give 100 percent
of the blood that’s donated.
“If you’re between 17 and
66, and generally healthy. you
can help change all that. And
your one blood donation can
help up toﬁve people to live.
"Call your Red Cross Blood

Center and make a donor
appointment soon. It's one way
you can help keep Red Cross
ready. . . to help others."

 

Keep Red Cross
ready.

Perhaps only a small coinci-
dence, CMU’s success with “Short
Eyes” might be partially attributed
to the recent television documen-
tary “Scared Straight” which won
a Pulitzer Prize. Still, most of the
credit should go to director John
Wells and his actors.

grants, nominate new trustees and

The three o’clock meeting will be

' for the investigation

Spring has finally arrived fullfledged in Pitts-
burgh along with green lawns, blossoming flowers
and peeling sunburns, today brings that ultimate sign
of spring-—the primaries. However, the list of can-
didates vying for the Democratic slot on the ballot
for county commissioner clashes appallingly with the
more pleasant symbols of the season. ‘ '

The two big names amoung these contenders are
Coroner Cyril Wecht and Sherriff Eugene Coon.

Wecht is currently under investigation for his

alleged use of public- facilities for private gain. He

has charged that the investigation of his acceptance
of fees for private'services performed at the morgue
was politically inspired, charging that the in-
vestigation is the result of‘ a conspiracty between
Coon and the media: ’

Coon, for this part, says that Wecht’s explanation
“‘verges on paranoia”. Of
course, Coon has always been on hand to. make a
quick comment or two on -Wechtfs alleged activities.
Whether he indeed had anything to do with the in-
vestigation breaking on the dawn of the primaries is

This is the time of year when newspapers urge
readers to voice their opinions at the polls. We, in the
past, have not been exceptions’ to the rule, but we
believe this year's race for county commissioner is
nothing to shout about.

Wecht’s image is dubious and ambiguous; Coon is
more interested in glutting in Wecht’s carnage rather
than taking a stance on anyissues. In all honesty, we
feel that neither is fit to hold the position of county
commissioner, and would urge our readers not to
vote for either. ’

Except that would pave the way for incumbant

else. The county has stagnated under his leadership.
But the price for change may be a bit too high.

pure conjecture, and not the issue.

We do not condone Wecht and his activities, but at
the same time, there is no defense either for Coon,
who has primarily built his campaign on the residual

from Wecht’s crumbling credibility.

The jejeune mudslinging between Wecht and Coon
is appalling, and vies with the fuel crisis squabbles

. Every generation has a fad for
which it is remembered in the
future. Most fads usually involve
some type of prank and are
generated by and identiﬁed most
with college students.

The most prestigious of the

’ professional associations for col-

lege administrators is considered to
be’ the National Association of
Student Personnel Administrators.

They meet annually, and at their

‘April: conference in Washington,
'D.C., one session dealt with the
V new wave of behavior hitting.

America's college and university
campuses. 1 The session titled
“Animal House: Fact or Fiction”

‘ was conducted by three administra-

tors from Texas A & M University.

P The conference program noted that

the session “will explore the
behavior exempliﬁed in the movie
“Animal House” which was
popular with college age students
earlier this year. Is this behavior
fact or ﬁction? What is the
psychology behind a behavior trend
in the college age student, and how
can some of this energy be
harnessed and turned to positive
direction?”

The session, which was opened
with preview trailers from the
movies “Animal House,” “Satur-
day Night Fever,” f‘Grease,” and
“Rocky Horrow Picture Show,”
was broken down into three
sections: (1) a discussion of the
prevalency of “Animal House”
type behavior around the country,
(2) a discussion of reasons for the
latter behavior, and (3) ways the
behavior can be channeled to

a constructive ways.

Ron Blatchley, director of stu-

dent affairs at A & M, developed
the session idea after what he said
was “the biggest food ﬁght we had
ever had.” A one-page question-
naire regarding such behavior was
written and sent out from his ofﬁce
to 80 institutions around the
country. He said thatthere were 60
returns and that every return noted
that there was some type of
evidence of behavior from the
movie. “The behavior itself is a
release from pressure of grades-
over 60 percent of the returnees
said, and 68 percent said it was a
nostalgic trace,” Blatchley said.
One of Blatchley’s colleagues
said that the behavior is a
combination of several reasons and
used the ﬁndings of renowned
researches such as Abraham
Maslow and Henry Murray to
support his presentation. He also
read comments from various
sources regarding the movie. From
persons involved in the making of
the movie came these comments:

1979

John Landis, director, calls the
behavior the “humor of outrage.”
John Belushi, star of the movie:
“My character says it’s okay to
screw-up.” Chris Miller, script
writer: “Today’s kids have no real
era of their own.” From practicing
psychologists came these com-
ments: “It takes the place of
driving social issues—latch on to
something they can enjoy and
exploit;” “Gives students the
chance to see who he or she is;”
and “...testing——ﬁnding out what
their limits are.”

Student personnel administra-
tors commented: “It is the result of
media exploitation;” “It’s this
generation’s opportunity to rein-
vent the wheel and rediscover
sex,” and “There’s a lack of
sufﬁcient role models.”

Students responded: “It was
crazy. It was fun. It was good
bull;” “It is something» to share
with friends;” “...good music;”
“It pokes fun at fraternities;”
“...good excuse to get weird;”
“It’s (“Animal House”) original;”
“It was like you remembered it;”
“...opportunity to belong;” and
“One last chance to be young and
blow it off.”

The third A & M administrator

Reasons Behind ‘Animal House’ Craze Explored  

offered ways to rechannel “Animal
House”-type behavior. Some good
suggestions were made regarding
orientation and academic calendar
scheduling, but most of the
discussion went back to rechannel-
ing the behavior into identical
behavior that was being rechannel-
ed. The administrator said that
“unusual or illegal activities”
could be developed. These include
jello ﬁghts, parity raids, beer
parties, and places “where we
could bend the rules a little.”
Along with fads come discus-
sions attempting to analyze reasons
surrounding the behavior identiﬁed
with the fads. If so much attention
wasn’t focused on the behavior, it
would probably go away quicker
than it does. Nothing is really ever
the matter. \
As one audience member com-
mented after the session: “I really
don’t think students are doing
things that are really that different.
We’re focusing on itbecause of the
media. It is not necessarily
anymore of an escape than it was
five or six years ago.”

Pitt News Staff Writer

Led by triple jumper Larry
Kinney, the men’s track team
showed its hometown crowd just
how much they have progressed
this season. Kinney, a ﬁrst-year
leaper from Philadelphia, was
named as the Pitt Invitational’s
Most Valuable Athlete in the ﬁeld
events. With a jump of 51-6‘/2

 Kinney came to within 5‘/2 inches

of qualifying fogr the NCAA
championships in two weeks.

Kinney was chosen as the
Invitationals’ ﬁeld MVP by a vote
of all the coaches attending the
meet. Panther head coach Mike
Agostinella spoke of the improve-
ment that Kinney, ta walk-on, has
made since ‘coming to Pitt.

Triple jump winner Larry Kinney.

“Looking at the accomplishment

that Larry has made since his
arrival at Pitt has to go back to what
his jumping has come from”, said
Agostinella. “His best jump in
high school was 48-5, which means
that he is now jumping a little over
three feet more than he did in high
school.”

A number of Panthers fared well
in Saturday’s meet, which was
condensed froum two days to one
because of the heavy downpours in
the Pittsburgh area Friday night.
Friday’s trials were run in part
earlier Saturday morning,

Pitt opened up its invitational
with a second place finish in the
400-meter relay. The quartet of

Larry Shippen, Dwayne DeFoor,
Buddy Morris and Keith Leckenby

as the’ anchorman ran a time of
41.83 to ﬁnish behind Penn State.
In the javelin, Pitt’s Steve Roebuck‘
placedthird with a throw of 65.3
meters. Joe Wagner from nearby
Carnegie-Mellon took top honors
with a 67.18 throw. In the
remaining field events, Pitt’s Mike
Wallace placed third in the
hammer throw with a hurl of 128-11
and ﬁfth in the shot put with a 50-2
throw. In pole vault competition,
Panther Gene Roach tied with
Marshall’s Rusty Millendorf as the
two cleared 14-6 to place fourth.

The high jump competition was
won by Ken Glover of Hagerstown
with a jump of 7-0.

Other top-six ﬁnishers for the
Pantherskwere Joel Albers in the
800-meter run with a time of
1:51.8. The winner in that race,
Bruce Banter of Purdue, was able

to set one of ﬁve meet and stadium 1

records with his run of 1:51.0. In
the 400 meter intermediate hur-
dles, Curt Goltz of Pitt placed ﬁfth
with a 54.7 run.

Finishing second in the 5000
meter run for Pitt was Gary Siriano
with a time of 14:31.5. Siriano had
won this event in the Penn Relays
a few weeks ago. Of his
performance Siriano commented,
“My place was good but my timing
was slow,” said Siriano. “There
still is a long way to go before

nationals and I’m pretty optimistic I

about it. In the last two meets I’ll
just try to go and runs for the
qualifying time.”

The 1600-meter relay of
Leckenby, Bud Cooper, S/hippen
-and DeFoor ﬁnished third. After a
mixup on the last leg which ended
in Leckenby being spiked in the leg
by a fallen runner, the team still
ﬁnished third and recorded their
best time of the year of 3:14.5.

Anchorman Leckenby was disap-
pointed in the teams misfortune
but thought the overall meet went
pretty well for the Panthers. ‘

“The 400 meter team (of which
Leckenby runs the ﬁnal leg) went
well for us, ﬁnishing second,” said
Leckenby. “Our 1600 meter just
didn’t work, although it was our

Batmen Split Pair in Cleveland; 
 NCAA Playoff Chances Slim

By KAREN KADILAK

’ Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s baseball team (14-6) closes
its season this afternoon with a
makeup double-header against
Buffalo (21-13) at Trees Field.

The Panthers split Friday’s

A double-header’ with Cleveland

State at Cleveland’s Municipal
Stadium and probably are out of
NCAA playoff contention. They
lost the first game, 3-2, but won the
second, —8-3.

_“We have played good ball this
season,” Panther coach Bob Lewis
said Sunday. “The only bad game
we had was against George
Washington, when we made a lot of
errors and didn’t play well.

“Our trouble this season is we
haven’t been able to get the hits at
the right time,” Lewis said.
“We had nine men left on base in
last Monday’s loss to Bucknell. »\

“If we had hit better,-awe could
be 18-2 instead of 14-6,” Lewis
said. ' 

The lack of timely hittingg

according to Pitt team captain and
starting catcher, Jim Pastin, hurt
the Panthers in Friday’s loss
against Cleveland State.

“In the second game, we hit with
men on base,” Pastin said.
“But, in the ﬁrst game, we
couldn't get any runs for Allen
(Lachowicz). He’s pitched well for
us, but we never seem able to get
any runs for him when he’s on the
mound.”

Lachowicz (3-2) dropped his
second straight one-run decision.
The freshman from McKees Rocks
also was the losing pitcher in last
week’s 1-0 loss at Penn State.

In Friday’s ﬁrst game, Pitt led
going into the bottom of the
seventh inning, but Cleveland
State scored twice on a combination
of a walk, a hit batsman,‘a single
and a throwing error by Lachowicz
to win.

The Panthers fared better in the
second game, collecting four runs
in the second inning, two in the

third and single tallies in bothith
‘fourth and ﬁfth innings. A

Pitt outhit Cleveland State, 10-6,
in its win. Every Panther except
ﬁrst baseman Chuck Mesiano had
at least one hit. Mesiano, however,
walked in Pitt’s four-run second
inning.

BASEBALL NOTES: Don Koller
was the winning pitcher in the
second game. The junior from
Pleasant Hills is Pitt’s most
successful pitcher with a 4-1
record...Kol1er and Lachowicz will
start against Buffalo. Lachowicz
has a blister on his right hand, but
will pitch...Sunday’s game against
Temple at Trees Field was
cancelled because of threatening
weather...Lewis said the Panthers
were “thrilled” to play in
Cleveland’s Municipal Stadium...
“They had the scoreboard going,”
the Panther coach said. “Every
player had his batting average

posted.” ,_

“Maryland.

Four years ago, the Pantherette
track team placed fourth at the ﬁrst
annual Eastern Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women championships. ‘

Last weekend, only three mem-
bers of that team remained on the

Pitt squad, but ended up seeing the‘

Pantherettes place third out of 68
schools. This was Pitt’s highest
Eastern track finish since that
fourth-place showing in 1976 and in
the process edged out defending
EAIAW champ Penn State.

Led by the first-place 800—meter
medley relay team, the Panther-
ettes finish the first day of
competition in second place,
behind eventual team champion
Temple, paced by
several outstanding sprinters,
eased past the Pantherettes
Sunday and from there it was a
matter of holding off Penn State

. and the University of the District of

Columbia.

Leslie Palmer (100), Cissy
Wilborn(100), Linda Mitchell (200)
and Gwen Murray (400) broke the
EAIAW record in the medley relay
with Murray holding off a ﬁnal-lap
challenge by UDC’s Liz ._Young.
Their time 0 1243.5 was followed by

Tuesday, May 15, 1979-—Page 7

 Panﬂiereﬂe Track Team Places Third at EA IA W's

UDC in 1243.6 and Temple in

. 1:43.7.

Murray was a second-place
ﬁnisher behind Young in the
400-meter dash, while Palmer was
runner-up to Maryland’s Paula
Girven in the 100-meter hurdles.
Also taking a second-place (and
attaining all-East honors) was Peri
Jude Radecic in the discus.

The same runners from the
medley relay placed third in the

400-meter relayibehinid Temple and .

Maryland. Radecic was third in the
shot put.

In the scramble for team points,
the Pantherettes were at an
advantage when they placed in the
ﬁnal two events, the javelin and
high jump. Senior high jumpers
Karen Krichko and Marie Ribik,
who have consistently placed in
EAIAW championship competition
throughout the past four years at
both indoor and outdoor meets,
ﬁnished third and fourth, respect-
ively. Maryland’s Paula Girven
and Jalenel Chase, both having
cleared six feet, were top ﬁnishers
in the event. *

Pitt’s Carmen Scherich com- A‘

pleted 1‘the scoring with a sixth-
place in the javelin. ‘
