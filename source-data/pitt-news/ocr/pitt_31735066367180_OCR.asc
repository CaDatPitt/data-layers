A native of Marion, Ohio,
Thomas graduated from Princeton

Seminary. He was ordained a
Presbyterian minister in 1911 and

lem Church in New York until
World War 1. _ 9
Since his paciﬁst views were,
not accepted/ by the elders of
the church, Thomas resigned his

position in 1931.

Although he has never held a
public office, the 75-year-old So-
cialist ran for president ,ir_i 1928,
1932, 1936, 1940, 1944, and 1948.

In this time he has also written,

WEDNESDAYT SEPTEMBER 28, 1960 

Board Claims Act . s
Violations 9,

, of the University’s Pershin Z
S Rifles_Dri1l Team, blasted the Student Union Board today for

evicting his unit from its oﬁices in the Student Union.

“We were evicted supposedly for violating certain rules
and regulations of the Student Union,” Engel said. “But we
have never received a list of compulsory regulations. If we

had, we might have been able to‘

adhere to them."

Engel questioned the allocation
of his unit’s former offices to two
other organizations at‘ the Univer-
sity; the Inquiry Club and the Na-
tional Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People.

Objections Stated '

“The Inquiry Club is a new’ or-
ganization not widely known here
at the University,” Engel reasoned.
“The N.A.A.C.P. should not be
given office space in the Student
Unionbecause it is a national po-
litical group,” he said.

Engel said the abolishment of
the office of the Pershing Riﬂes
will curtail much‘ of the unit’s
activities. “We have represented.
the University ably at many
public performances all over the
country but bias was shown in
the evictionof my group.” he
said. _

Members of the Senate invited
Dr. William Cooper, director of
the Student Union, and Dick
Moriarity, president of SUB to at-

tend next Monday?s meeting of

the Senate to further explain this
situation. _
Reevaluation Needed

Also, at the meeting, Dr. Ronald -

Pease, assistant to the Dean of
‘Men and Senate adviser, asked
the members of the Senate t6 con-
cern themselves more with the
lack of “spirit” and “apathy”
among Pitt students. “There were
more band members than students
at,last Friday’s Pep rally,’.’ he
said... I _
Alan Schadt, senior senator.
said the administration can be

__held partly responsible for lack

of school spirit “What can be
more conducive to a build-up of ,
spirit. than a spontaneous at-
tempt to tear down the goal
posts aftera victorious football
A game?” he asked. 1 ,
“But now the University has
created seemingly indestructible
goal-posts, covered with grease,

and encircled by police.“

Dismissal of Classes —— Some Say

Spectator spirit which has back-
ed the Pittsburgh Pirates in the
1960 baseball season is strong
amid‘ University students.

Much to the dismay» of these
avid Pirate fans, classes will be
carried on as usual during the
days of World Series ball games.
Students expressed several opin-
ions in answering the question
“What effect do you think the ser-

pus activities?”

Mary Ella Lipchak, Arts, soph.:
“I think classes will be attended,
and activities ,will receive their

. Activities Will Suffer

Sam Simpson, Engr., jr.: “Class-
es should be called. I don’t think
activities will have too much sup-
port ‘during the
series.” *
Kathy Malloy, Arts, fr.:
“There shouldn’t be any classes
on the afternoons the games‘ are.

scheduled. Local students and
Pirate fans especially should be
excused and be allowed to
watch home games from the-
36th floor of the Cathedral.

Residence Hall
Population Up

By Over 40%

Three hundred ninety-eight
more students are living on
campus this year, as compared
with last.

1370 men and women, as op-
1370 men and women, as com-

posed to 972 in 1959. This in an
overall increase of 41 per cent.
Of the 1370, 812 are men and 558
are women.

The ratio of men to women in
the dorms is 1.45 to 1, a much
lower ratio than exists for the
University as a whole. This fall
saw an identical increase in men
and women living on campus, 199.

The largest single block of
residence students are freshmen,
of which 242 are women and 400
are men. Most of them live in
the "co-ed dorm, Holland Hall.

Holland Hall is the latest addi-
.tion to University living quarters.

Other buildings Ior the men in
addition to Holland are Dithridge,
Schenley, Salk, and Varsity Halls
and the Stadium. Women live in
McCormick, Amos, and Bracken-
ridge Halls.

The la.rger number of resident
students living in the University
dormitories should increase stu-
dent identification with the Uni-
versity and increase participa-
tion in activities, according to
Donald Van Houten, director of
Men’s Housing.

He also feels that it is invaluable
experience to the individual to be
able to live with others of different
backgrounds, from varied commu-
nities, and of contrasting ethnic
groups.

THE PLEDGE YOU SAVE
MAY BE YOUR OWN

Today’s column is directed at those young female under-
graduates who have recently pledged sororities and are wor-
ried, poor lambs, that they won't make good. I‘-‘ollovvingz, is 3.
list of simple instructions which, if faithfully observed, will
positively gu2n'a.ntee that you will be a mad success as a.
sorority girl. ,

First, let us take..up the matter of housemothers. The
houcsemother is your friend, your guide, your mcntor. You
must treat her with respect. When you wish to speak to her,
address her as “Mother Sigafoos” or “.\la’am.” In no circum-
stances must you say, “Hey, fat lady.” ’

Second, let us discuss laundry. Never hang your wash on
the front porch of the sorority house. This is unsightly and
shows a-want of breeding. Use the Chapter Room.

Third, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing
meals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your
cook goes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu Varied
and nourishing. The least you can do is show your apprecia-
tion. Don’t just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim with
delight, “What delicious pork jowls 3” or “What a yummy soup

bone!” or “What scrumptious ﬁsh heads!” or “What clear.

water!”

Fourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance re-
ﬂects not just on yourself but on the whole house. It was
well enough before you joined a sorority to lounge around
campus in your old middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now
you must take great pains to dress in a manner which excites
admiring comments from all who observe you. A few years ago,
for example, there was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk
at the University of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to all her
sorors. Camille hit on the ingenious notion of suiting her garb
to the class she was attending. For inst-ance, to English Lit she
wore a buskin and jerkin. To German she wore lederhosen and
carried a stein of pilsener. To Econ she wore 120 yards of
ticker tape. Her shiningest hour came one day when she
dressed as a white mouse for Psych Lab. Not only her Chi

Omega sisters, but the entire student body went into deep.

mourning when she was killed by the janitor’s cat.

   

  
 

      
 

I725 M7/;<' ’
Z. 5 s Q Q
refer, of course, to dating.

As we have seen, the way you dress reflects on your sorority,

Next week the University will meet with a most un-

academic situation as thousands of fans descend upon Oak-
land for the World Series. ;

This, no doubt, will raise problems for those intent
upon study. Lectures on the nature of tragedy will be in-
terrupted by periodic roars from Forbes Field. Vibrating
cheers will disturb delicate lab experiments.

Resident students will lie awake nights as jubilant fans

dents have plans to cut classes, either t_o attend the name
across the street or View it on television. Hopefully, classes
will not be cut by professors. ,

I

Commuters will ﬁnd parking in the area even more
difficult than usual. Finding transportation in and from the
area will be a problem, as sports enthusiasts pack into
every trolley, bus, and cab.

Hundreds of people will invade the University build-
ings, and out of town visitors will insist that they be taken
to the top floor of the cathedral.

But students can sit back and knowingly smile at these
antics. For in the not too distant future Forbes Field and
its noisy crowds will be gone from Oakland.Where base-
‘ball games are now being played, University buildings will
stand. '

And allwill be quiet.

Don't Take Advice

By Tom Bryant

Joseph Addison, in his essay
“The Spectator No. 512,” writes
“there isnothing which we re-
ceive with so much reluctance as
advice.” -

Everyone, at ,
one time or an- "
other, follows, '
with some un-

certainty, t h e
advice of others,
only to later ;

admit to one’s
con 5 c i e n c e_:
“y o u w e r e y
r i g h t; I .;'
shouldn’t have
done it.”
Unable to resist,

I recently
took the advice of a newspaper

promotion which was subtly
stated: “get more out of life; go
out to a movie.”

Dragging myself away from
the hypnotic eye of the little

black box in the livingroom, and

with money in hand, I set out to
see if movies really were better
than ever.

The two hour epic (27) that I
struggled through was Sinclair
Lewis’ “Elmer Gantry” or else
that’s what it was supposed to
be.

Decorus Mockery

The basic theme of the story
was the mockery that many of
the early “revivalists” made of

 

religion during the 1930’s. The
producers of the picture were
careful to assure the audience
that no religious sects or organi—.
zations were being ‘ridiculed or
slandered. This seemed to be the
only part of the picture that was
in goodtaste.

The main characters, and be-
lieve me they were characters,
were “Sister” Sharon Falconer,
a revivalist, and our hero Elmer
Gantry, an appliance‘ salesman
turned preacher. The two travel-
led about the countryside, gen-
erally turning religion into a
circus-type affair, what with the
brass bands, clowns, parades,
and a meeting tent, strangely
reminiscent‘ of the old Ringling
Bros. big tops.

In addition to this chaos, au-

I thor Lewis managed to mix ro-

mance, sin, and comedy into his
book. As usual the movie ver-
sion eliminated all but the sin.

Elmer Gantry was portrayed
by Burt Lancaster and “Sister”
Sharon by Jean Simmons. Al-
though many critics have ac-
claimed their performances as
the best of their respective ca-
reers, if I were they I would
want to forget about this picture
as quickly as possible.
Sweet and Innocent

The most surprising role was
played by Pittsburgh’s Shirley

Jones. After seeing Miss Jones
play the “sweet young thing” in
“Oklahoma” and “Carousel,” it
was a welcome relief to see her

drop the sugar-coated parts and
do some real acting. Putting her
in the -role of one of the most
enterprising lasses of the pic-
ture’s red-light district was in-
deed brilliant oﬂi-beat casting.

The conclusion to this wide-
screen “Tobacco Road” was a
real Clyde. After “Sister” Sharon
was called the modern Joan of
Arc (by her manager of course),
the plot ended after Joan, ’er
Sharon was trapped and burned
in her blazing “tabernacle.” This
was a suitable ﬁnale for “the
new Joan of Arc.”

Somehow, while leaving the
theatre, I sensed the taste and
smell of rotten eggs being left
behind. Justto be sure, I hur-

ried home and washed my mouth

out with soap.

Later that evening, while
viewing a 1929 movie on televis-
ion, I was sure that “All Quiet
On The Western Front” would
be remembered long after Elmer
Gantry had marched in his last
parade.

The moral to this story is very
simple: “get more out of life,
stay HOME and watch a GOOD
movie on TELEVISION . . . and

and changes which are every-

Le’r's Keep Pace . . .

don’t take other people’s advice.”

Freedom Is.   Absent

By Kathy Maser

Our university is growing and improving in

than ever — and more to come. Each freshman
class is larger than the last, and we notice the
addition of a greater number of Andrew Mellon
professors each year. We have
here at Pitt at least a satisfac-
tory‘ physical plant, by many
standards an excellent one, and
the quality of instruction is un-
deniably superior in many areas.

However, the rate of change
in the academic structure has not
kept pace with the expansion

where evident. What Pitt lacks
for the serious undergrad is free-
dom. Being compelled to attend
a certain number of classes per week is stifling to
many students who would rather spend the best
working hours of the day reading 'material of spe-
cial interest in a particular course.

They would like to have time for perusal in the
library, a solid stretch of three or four hours to
spend on something which may be too important
to put down at the sound of the next bell. There
is often the feeling that the hour which he must
spend in class at the next bell, because his grade
depends on it, is not worth the time lost from
individual reading.

A Basic Need

Many universities have solved this basic need
for study by variations of a system of tutorials,
where students are given a lengthy reading list and
a broad topic assignment for research. They have
the privilege either of meeting with the professor a
few times a semester to discuss speciﬁc problems
or attending his lectures when a particularly in-
teresting topic is scheduled to be discussed. In
this way, a student is not compelled to attend lec-
tures of material he already knows.

Pitt has not established a free academic system
to keep pace with the remainder of its progress. It
is disappointing in a university which has so much
potential that the head of at least one department,
well known in his ﬁeld and recognized as a ﬁne
scholar, should base part of the grade of his upper-
class courses on class discussion. It is a pity that
this aspect of education is found beyond the sixth
or seventh grade.

Going under the assumption that a lecture from
the head of a department is much more valuable
than random comments from several students, it is
safe to object that an upperclass course should not
be partially graded from class discussion.

A look into the classroom on any given day will

- ._ , >,i::..»'

» show the reason.‘ We have the virtuoso with the

   

 

wait. ’til I graduateso I

intense, eager eyes, hand poised for ﬂight at the
first sign of diminuendo from the professor; those
who set slouched a la chaise lounge with the om-
niscient stare and the “if-I-can-prove-you’re~
wrong-I’ll—get-a-brownie-point” attitude; and then
there are those who would like to know more
about the material and who wish that every one
would shut up so they can learn it.

When the conscious object of student discussion
is a visible grade on a transcript the whole pur-
pose of academic freedom is being defeated. There
is no room for such an indidious cause of dishon-
esty in a classroom at Pitt.

The place for discussion of speciﬁc material ‘is
in a seminar of four or ﬁve qualiﬁed students in
their senior year. Any other type of discussion is
not based on research but on opinion, and if
progress of any kind were based on opinion we
would probably still be living in the middle ages.
Attendance Should be Voluntary

If Pitt is to become the respected institution
which it promises to be, attendance. should not be
required of the upperclassman. It has always been
true that those instructors who have the most to
offer have never had to enforce compulsory at-
tendance. Students come anyway. Moreover, every
senior should be expected to participate in a semi-
nar in his major ﬁeld and should be responsible for
completing individual, original research, somewhat
on the order of an undergraduate thesis.

Opportunity should be provided also for original
laboratory research of a long-range nature. Per-
mission could be granted for research to be done in
any free time, not just a few speciﬁc hours a week.

And it is certainly a sign of academic medioc-
rity when many students are able to carry 19 or
20 credits without a severe loss, if any, in grade
point average. This is not permited in many ﬁne
schools. The students with this type of schedule

emust work much harder and hurry himself, ulcer-

ridden and hollow—eyed, to complete just the bare
minimum requirements of each course.
Fails to Benefit

Pitt must do more for those especially bright
students whom we know exist, who feel stiﬂed by
lack of academic freedom. Sometimes they quit
school sadly after even 3 years, ‘or perhaps they
transfer several times feeling at each place that
something is missing. Part of the fault lies with
the student —- lack of maturity or plain laziness.
But a great deal may be with the institution which
may not provide enough real incentive for study
and yet may punish the student who therefore
must seek knowledge on his own by failing himfor
absence.

Deﬁnite changes must be made in this most im-
portant aspect of our university, or many students
will continue to say, as one student did, "I can’t

I Stuclenfs~Praised

Master-Planners
Given Recognition

Editor, The Pitt News:

A common topic on any col-
lege campus is the alleged
apathy of the student body. The
assertion is that the student is
al\'.'ays ready to complain about
his lot but seldom willing to give
oi.‘ his time and talents toward
the l‘L'SOlutlOl’1 of his institutions,
real or imagined problems. 

The contributions of students;
who do involve themselves inf
the planning and implementationi
of programs contributing to theirl
own and the University’s, wel-l
fare should, on certain occasions,’
be given public recognition.
Such is the purpose of this let-
till,

Three undergrad‘uat.es partici-1

patud this year in the planning ‘

and the production of the fresh-
man orientation program. With
their committees, they“ gave free-
ly of their time and their en-
ergies during June, July, and
August —- months which hardly
encourage vigor./and imagina-
tive effort. 3 ' V
Immediately before and during
Orientation Week, these students
devoted practically full time to
their very heavy responsibili-
ties. 
Every enterii g freshman, and
the undergraduate body as a
whole, should know that the
Prcccptorial Program, the Fresh-
man Outing at Kiski, and the
Introduction to Student Activi-
ties were the special responsi-
bilities of these three students.
The success of each program
was a tribute to the organiza-

tional skill, the hard work, and .
the devotion to Pitt so much a

part of each of them. .\

On behalf of the University
Orientation Committee and the
entire Pitt community, I would
like to thank and to give com:
pletely unsought public recog-
nition to Tom McClure, to Sue

For ‘Outstanding’ Job

Editor, The Pitt News:

During.the past two weeks, I
have heard many students opin-
ions on the Presidential ‘Cam-
paign between classes, in the
Tuck Shop and other places
where students gather.

Most of the people with whom
I have conversed with have us-
ually remarked that Kennedy
would be almost a shoo—in if he
were not Catholic. I know many
Republican supporters will scoff
at this statement but neverthe-
less this is a remark I have
often heard while talking with
both Kennedy and Nixon sup-
porters.

Almost immediately after this
topic comes up, the question of
the anti-Catholic campaign
against Al Smith in 1928 arises.
There is some truth to this but

historians have proven that
Smith’s stand on the prohibition
issue lead to his defeat. How-
ever, one cannot discount the
anti-Catholic feeling that was
prevalent at that time.

I feel that 1960 is a far cry

I

from 1928. Times have changed.

considerably since Smith’s time.
Although religious prejudice _is
impossible to stamp out entirely
religious tolerance on the part
of various denominations has in-
creased since the l920’s.

Since we are at the beginning
of a new decade, I think that all
eligible voters should follow the
oft-repeated advice and vote for
the candidate who has the best
presidential merits.
done America can conclusively
prove to the Communist coung
tries of the world that we are
truely a land which believes in
freedom and justice for all.

For Re-organization

A letter calling for -the complete re—organization of the’
Graduate Student Organization has been issued by Forrest
Jewell, acting president of/the group.

In the letter Jewell states a need for the change, and pro-

poses that the new system be composed of various commit:
tees. At present there is a_‘ forum of jcwenty—ﬁVe represen-

A.

tatives. ‘ ,
The letter suggests a social, an
action, a program, a student in-

formation", and a publicity com--

mittee. These new committees
would work individually, having
their own executive council. How-
ever, they will still be under one
group of officers. ,, ,
This proposed system will be
presented to the graduate stu-
dent body at an open imeeting‘
this Monday at 5 p.m. in» the
Schoolof Public Health Building
auditorium." A guest speaker
will highlight the meeting. .
Jewell said, “The representative
form of organization which we
have been trying may and does

work at other universities. It does .

The programftis an attempt to
create an awareness in students
of the need, for closer relations

As‘Kelly points out, “There is a

Louis A. Allen, who just re-

All the hostesses had nothing

‘Team in Good Shape
As Cats’ Injuries Heal

By JACK SMITH
After weeks of being rated as a potential powerhouse,
the Panther gridders ﬁnally look like they are ready to ex-
plode against Oklahoma at Norman, Oklahoma, this Sat-

,9

‘furday.

I‘

Plans to have the game televised on closed—circuit tele-
vision, have been cancelled. Under NCAA rules, a team on

 

probation cannot appear in a bowl¢

game or before a television audi-
ence. The Sooners were caught
last year for illegal methods of
recruiting.

This will have little effect on
the Panthers, however, who are
hungry for the first win of the
campaign. Two» weeks ago they
lost an 8-7 decision to UCLA be-
cause of two disputed calls. Last
week Michigan State tied the
Panthers 7-7.

Sophomores Improving

“The only time I saw Oklahoma
was three years ago when they
‘beat us 26-0,” Mike Ditka said.
'*‘This year is another story. I feel
that we have the team to take
them,” the Panther captain stated.

The Panthers have faced the
Sooners four times. The Cats
have yet to topple Oklahoma.

“With our experienced sopho-
mores improving we will win our
share of games,”-Coach Michel-
osen said. “Basically we have a
sound club. The inexperience in
our line has hurt us, but the soph-
‘omores are'improving and will be
more effective in our remaining

S/games.”
Vignali Doubtful Starter

Michelosen was. referring to
John Draxler, Ralph Conrad and
Gary Kaltenbach who have been
called on to ﬁll the gaps caused by
Panther injuries.

Regis Coustillac returned to
action last week after sitting out
the UCLA game with a broken
thumb. Michelosen used Cous-
tillac mainly on offense where

«-vi there was less chance of rein-
kjuring the thumb.

-7»

 

RON HDELFINE
Hungry for Cat Victory

Larry Vignali, who received a
bruised shoulder in the UCLA
game, is a doubtful starter for
Saturday. “Vignali’s absence has
been felt in our lineup,” Michelo-
sen said. Vignali is an all-Ameri-
can candidate and one of the
Panthers leading linemen on both
offense and defense.

Mills Leads Defense

Taking over the chore of hold-
ing together the Panther’s line is
Dick Mills. A senior this year,
Mills is an important cog in the
Panther’s defensive machine that
has limited the opposition to one
touchdown per game. A rugged
blocker and tackler, Mills can
only be described as 230-pounds
of rhythmic savagery.

Another of the Panthers’ most
consistent linemen has been End
Ron Delﬁne. Although often un-
heralded, Delﬁne is rated by op-
posing linemen as one of the
Panther’s best. Delﬁne often
teams up with teammate Mike
Ditka to give the Panthers one
of the biggest threats to oppos-
ing passers.

Delﬁne received a bruised knee
against the Spartans but is ex-
pected to be ready for the Soon-
ers. Conrad, in the same game, re-
ceived a small cut over the left
eye that required two stitches.
Apparently the rest of the team is
in good shape.

Several Panthers claimed after
the Michigan State game that the
Spartans didn’t tackle‘ nearly as
hard as UCLA. Maybe it was a
good thing, for the Cats can’t af-
ford any injuries to key men, es-
l pecially on the line.

‘Open Season At

:Indiana State

MARSHALL ROMEO

,, ‘The Pantherx Cubs meet Indiana-
‘ State at Indiana today in their first

game ofthe year. i
Coach Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi
predicts a good season now that
his linemen have developed into
‘I’ a strong forward wall. “The backs
A were never a problem but we had
quite a problem with the linemen,”
said Cecconi. _. . A
They have been tutored by two
ﬁne coaches, Bob Pollock and Nick
Carr, and have learned fast. The
forward wall will be led by Ron
Marini a n d Jerry Cherry at
 ckles, John Zabcar and Joe Gut-
<~r~4{t:inbar at guards and Jack Cullen
5"? enter;

The backﬁeld seems set with
Paul Martha at quarterback, and
halfbacks Bob Gutshall and
John Gregg ﬂanking the highly
touted Rick Leeson at fullback.
Leeson was the star of the
scrimmage against C a r n e g i e
Tech and will carry the brunt
of the running attack against the
Little Indians.

Cecconi will use both offensive
and defensive units because the
state teacher’s conference rules
recognize two—platoon football. He
will use the strongest one way
players on their respective units
instead of eleven two-way men.

Cecconi feels that many of the
players on the defensive platoon
could move into the offensive po-

Harriers Seek

At Ohio U.

Coach Carl Rees’ Panther
harrierswill be looking for
win number two.this Satur-
day when they meet Ohio
University an‘d Central State

in a triangular match at
Ohio U.

The Cats will be favored to
out-distance both teams in Satur-
day’s ﬁve mile cross country
jaunt. For the past two years the
Panther harriers have shut out
Ohio U. 15-40 both times.

Central State is a new opponent
for the Blue and Gold. Bill Hinch-
berger and Reed Clarke, Panther

co-captains, ﬁnished third and
fourth respectively last year;
against Ohio U. Ron Rush and:
John Christoﬁ, 1960 graduates,§
ﬁnished ahead of the Cats co-
captains.

Harry Stokes is expected to
carry the load for the harriers
this year. In the pre-season
practices, Stokes has been run-
ning the fastest with Hinchber-
ger, Vance Carter, Clarke, Bob V
Tarkany following close behind. 

In last Friday’s victory over
Slippery Rock the Blue and Gold
had their ﬁve leading runners
ﬁnish one after another with only
a 46-second time spread between
the ﬁrst and fifth man.

“The most important element
in cross-country running is to
have your men ﬁnish near each
other,” said Rees. “If you have
a couple of minutes elapsing be-
tween your ﬁrst and ﬁfth man,
then you are in trouble,” he con-
cluded.

Backing up Stokes will be
Hinchberger and Tarkany, who
ﬁnished second and third respec-
tively against Slippery Rock.
Hinchberger is in his senior year
and has been singled out by Rees
as having as much potential as

Rooters Face
Slippery Rock,
Then Ohio U.

By JOHN FLEMING

This week the booters will
be put to the grind. Today
the Panthers meet Slippery
Rock away and Saturday the
Blue and Gold will make their
home debut against Ohio Uni-

versity. The booters plan to knock
them both off although it will be
tougli all the way.

This afternoon the Pathers meet
one of their big soccer rivals in
Slippery Rock.
In their last ﬁve E;
outings with the  ’

Cats have post-

Defense Question Mark
"On the other hand, their de-
fense is a big question mark.
Slippery Rock lost most of their

Sooners Seek Revenge

Oklahoma Ready to Upset Cats

In This Week’s Game

at Norman

By ART FLEISCHNER 6
Seeking revenge for last
week’s 19-3 loss to Northwest-
ern, the Oklahoma Sooners
are hard at work preparing to
meet the Panthers. After the
unexpected defeat, the Soon-
ers will definitely be up for this
Saturday.
According to Head Coach Bud
Wilkinson, “The team had a very

good spring practice from the
8 8 *

standpoint of interest, morals and
a desire to improve. Our line has
adequate potential but our back-
ﬁeld situation is the weakest _I
can recall since coming to Okla-
homa.”

With the loss of such players as
quarterback Bobby ‘Boyd, right
halfback Brewster Hobby, and

All-American fullback Prentice
Gautt, the Sooners had better im-

prove the backﬁeld problem
*-

if

they hope to have a successful
year.
Problem At Quarterback

The kicking situation should be
more consistant this year. The
passing department will probably
be about the same. Rushing and
total offense will definitely not be
as good as the previous season.
The overall defense in all prob-
ability will not compare to 1959.

As is the case with most
teams, the quarterback problem
must be solved. It is hoped that

.Jimmy Carpenter, a sophomore
starter at left half in 1958, can
recover from a sore leg that kept
him on the bench last year and
ﬁll in as the ﬁeld general.

Oklahoma has fullback Ronnie
Hartline and tackle Marshall
York as its co—captains. Hartline
who was voted the greatest high-
school back in the nation in 1956,
and who was voted the outstand-
ing player in several different
games, is expected to be named
to many All-American teams at
the end of the season.

Six Starters Lost

Although losing six starters and
four alternates from last year’s
squad, Coach Wilkinson is hoping
that the five returning starters
and seven alternates will ﬁll in
adequately.

Tackle Tom Cox is counted on
to be one of the mainstays of the
line. Guard Karl Milstead. a
junior, is the best since Bill
Krisher in 1956. As Oklahoma’s
middle guard. he is especially
agile on the draw play. 1

End Ronnie Payne is also a jun-
ior. He is a standout on offense
but can use some improvement on
defense.

Another starter is Junior Center
Jim Byerly. He moves very well
for a big man and can be counted
on to aid the Sooner offense.
Jerry Tillery, the only senior of
the five returning players is ex-
pected to anchor the right end
position. He is an excellent all
around player.

Two sophomores who may
crack the starting line-up are left
guard Duane Cook and right’half-
back Bill Meacham. Cook was the
top freshman on last year’s Soon-
er team and never makes the same
mistake twice. Meacham, if a knee
injury heals, should see action in
the next game.

IM Dorm League
Opens Today; Sigs
Delis Win in F rats

The Intramural dorm football
League opens its season today at
Schenley Oval. The competition
will .be rough with a wide range
of talent being tapped,

Interfraternity action last week
saw PiKA get stopped by Sigma
Chi and Delta Tau Delta edge out
the Phi Ep.’s in overtime both by
the score of 7-6.

The Independent League opened
last week. Leading the “opening
round play were last year’s
champs the Chinese Bandits along
with last year’s runnersup the Psi
Omega’s. Both have 2-0 records.

The Bandits are led by Jerry

Matulevic and Alex Perinus, a
combination which makes them
the team to beat. Starring for
the Psi Omega are Cookie Dara-
hesi and Dave Johnson.

Dave Starret, co-head of the IM
league, said, “We are looking for-
ward to another good year in IM
league football. The way things
have started it looks like we are

going to have it.”

Therefore, the Panthers are never

sure what to expect. ,_
After the Slippery Rock gam

the booters will come home to

meet a strong team from Ohio

‘University. “The whole Ohio U.

team is solid,” stated‘ Coach Be-
mis, “and they are a sound de-

' Ohio Has Terrors

The Ohioteaml has several ter-
rors to which the Panthers have
been alerted. The co-"captains, Ed
Butler the left fullback and Neil
Monroe the’ center halfback,
should be able tohandle the club

in ﬁne style. Besides the co-cap-

tains, Joe Esterreicher and Al-
Rawi should give the Blue and
Gold a lot of trouble.

The Panthers will have to
shift players to make up for the
loss of “Corky” Cuthbert. Al-
though the booters certainly feel
the loss of Cuthbert, they should
be able to do without him until
his leg is in good shape ‘again.
Even though the Cats are ﬁelded
against two tough competitors,
they have a good chance to post
a 3-0 record at the end of this
week.
