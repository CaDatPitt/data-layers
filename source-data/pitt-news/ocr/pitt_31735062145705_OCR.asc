1200 Parents, 175
Faculty Members
Expected At Fete

Choose 150 Students To Serve
As Escorts To Guests At
Chancellor’s Reception

Takes Place Next Friday

One hundred and seventy-ﬁve mem-
bers of the faculty, including the
heads of every department of the
University, will have conferences with
the expected crowd of 1,200 parents
who will attend the twelfth annual
Chancellor’s reception to the parents
of freshmen at 8 o’clock next Friday
evening in Memorial hall.

In addition nearly 150 students have
been chosen from various representa-
tive branches of the University to
serve as aides and escorts to the
parents so that they will have no
trouble in ﬁnding their way through
the hall.

The guests will be received in the
main auditorium of Memorial hall and
will assemble and be seated while the
student orchestra is playing several
selections.

Dr. John G. Bowman, Chancellor of
the University, will then address the
parents. After his address they will
be escorted to the third ﬂoor, where
they will receive the grade cards of
their children for the first seven-week
period of study at Pitt. They will
then confer with the faculty adviser
and the various instructors of their
son or daughter,

These conferences have proven very
successful in the past, according to
Theodore Biddle, assistant dean of
men. They have cemented ﬁne re-
lationships between parents and in-
structors, and many times the
parents have been able to correct the
scholastic difficulties of their in-
dividual children after one of these
conferences.

Invitations from the Chancellor
have been sent to the parents of
every freshman attending school at
Pitt. The reception, however, is open
only to the parents of freshmen; no
freshman students will attend.

Following the rather lengthy period
of individual conferences there will
be a social hour, featured by the serv-
ing of refreshments,

The list of students chosen to act]
as escorts and aids to the parents
was not complete when this edition
of the Pitt News went to press. Thirty
of them will be members of the Pitt
Riﬂes, honorary military drill platoon.
The remainder will be a rep-
resentative group chosen by Thyrsa
W. Amos, dean of women, and The-
odore W. Biddle, assistant to the dean
of men.

tomorrow at the game, according
to all predictions, and the open

Held Up‘!

Printers, Censors Cause
Delay Of Panther
Issue

 

The Pitt Panther’s International
Art number will appear on the
campus this morning!

Scheduled to be brought out
Wednesday, the magazine was
held up by mechanical difﬁcul-
ties at the Panther printing shop.
A rush shipment of paper late
Tuesday afternoon was necessary
in order to have the kitty ap-
pear today.

Substantial reports from the
chiefs of the publication yester-
day afternoon intimated that, in
addition to the mechanical difﬁ-
culties, the 'gazine.’-s censors
haven’t ﬁnishe their scrutiny of
the issue which, the editor claims,
is Rabelaisian, to say the least.

Satirizing the current Interna-
tional Art exhibition, which is tak-
ing place at -Carnegie Institute,
the magazine offers saucy car-
toons, clever articles and subtle
satire. The cover, reminiscent of
Rembrandt, shows two classic
statues poking fun at the exhibit.

Yuletide Festival

Student Relations Committee
Chooses Dent Chairman
Of Pre-Holiday Dance

Grotto Named For Aﬁair

John Gourley, D34, was selected at
a special meeting of student relations
committee of Student council Monday
afternoon as chairman of the annual
Yuletide Festival Dance, scheduled
for Friday, December 15.

Gour1ey’s petition was favored over
those of four other petitioners:
George Blum, E34; King Derr, C35;
Lucky Joseph Shumaker, E34; and
Charles Johnson, BA35. Gourley is
a member of Psi Omega, dental fra-
ternity.

The Yuletide Festival is sponsored
by student relations committee itself;
hence, the chairmanship appointment
was in the hands of this group and
not in those of Student council, which
usually selects the chairmen of Uni-
versity dances.

Although Gourley has not yet sub-
mitted the committee list to the office
of the dean of men, one deﬁnite ar-
rangement has already been com-
pleted, the hiring of the Grotto ball-
room.

Present plans call for no inclusion
of a pageant in the Festival program.

was a feature of the event,

Informal Dance Climaxes Round
Of Events For Conference

 

A full schedule of round table meet-
ings, luncheons and discussion meet-
ings, climaxed by an informal dance
at the Schenley Hotel, will feature the
annual conference day sponsored by
Interfraternity council a week from
tomorrow.

Deﬁnite places have not yet been
set for the various events on the pro-
gram, according to Robert Willison,
BA34, general chairman of the con-
ference. The luncheons for pledges
and for active members of fraternities
will probably be conducted at frater-
nity houses, as will the majority of
the meetings.

Al Buhl and his Red Peppers is the
orchestra selected for the dance, and
will play from 9 o’clock to midnight.
Since the affair is taking place on a
Saturday night, dancing will be halted
at 12 o’clock. Tickets for this affair
are on sale to fraternity men for $1.50
per couple.

The inclusion of a pledge luncheon
among the conference events marks
the carrying out of a recommendation
to Interfraternity council by a com-
mittee under King Derr, C35, advocat-
ing the arranging of such an affair.
Until last year an annual pledge ban-
quet had been sponsored by the Greek

that through the scientiﬁc approach Cwen will attend at least one meet-
toward religion, one’s religious be- ing of every unit group.

In addition to these committees
there will be several “ﬂoating” mem-
bers who will attend a diﬁerent meet-
ing each time. The purpose of this
plan is that the Cwens and the fresh-
man women may become better ac-
quainted. The membership committee
is composed of: Betty Glass, C36,

Pitt Meli-aces
Husker Hopes
For Title Bid

Matesic, Timmons Replace
Sebastian And Rocker
In Starting Lineup

Sauer Nebraska Threat

By Robert E. Badger
Pitt News Sports Editor

Today the big, bad, burly boys from
the University of Nebraska are in
town. Tomorrow afternoon at the
Stadium they clash with what we
hope to be the bigger, badder, burlier
boys from good old Pitt.

The Cornhuskers this year are just
as big and able as ever. Thus far
they have defeated Texas 26 to 0,
Iowa 20 to 0, Kansas State 9 to 0,
Oklahoma 19 to 7, Missouri 26 to 0,
and Kansas 12 to 0. A victory over
the Panthers tomorrow would in all
probability just about give the Rose
Bowl bid to the Huskers, After to-
morrow they have only Iowa to play,
and should they defeat the Panthers,
Iowa should cause them little trouble.

By defeating the Cornhuskers to-
morrow the Panthers can very much
enhance their chances for the myth-
ical football championship of these
United States, If things pan out the
way we have them ﬁgured, that is
Minnesota to beat Michigan, Notre
Dame to defeat Army, and Southern
California to defeat Oregon and
Georgia, then who will have a better
right to the mythical title than Pitt?
Princeton and Duke may still be un-
defeated, but what of it?

There will be two changes in the
Panther starting line—up for tomor-
row’s game. Bob Timmons will start
at left end in place of Harvey Rooker
and Dick Matesic will be in the game
at right halfback in place of Mike
Sebastian, who is still suffering from
an injury suffered in the Duquesne
game. Sebastian may not play Sat-
urday but he should be in good shape

Inquiry Forum I-Ias Discussion On
Theories Of Eugenics

 

“Certainly I favor sterilization of
the eugenically unﬁt in the United
States,” said Roswell Johnson, Uni-
versity professor, now on leave of
absence, and co-author of Applied
Eugenics, in answer to a question dur-
ing his address on “Nativism‘ and
Eugenics” to the Inquiry forum Wed-
nesday.

“Germany has the most nearly ideal
law,” he explained, “which legalizes
sterilization of feeble-minded, insane
and those capable of transmitting
hereditary defects. The consent of the
guardian and the recommendation of
three medical authorities are required
before such an action can take place,”
he said.

Dr. Johnson stated that while the
equalitarian opposes sterilization on
any grounds, the nativist would not
permit it within the race, and that
the eugenist is the only person strong-
ly in favor of eliminating bad hered-
itary strains wherever found.

In summing up his talk, Dr. John-
son gave his program of applied
eugenics, which he said would some
day have to be adopted in one form
or another if a better race of men
is to be developed.

classes, a.nd will turn in the answered
questions to Turner. Results of the

‘Queen’s Husband’

First Dramatic Group Offering
Well Received At Opening

 

Last night at the Schenley hotel
the Pitt Players’ ﬁrst production of
the year, “The Queen's Husband,”
opened and closed. A large crowd
doubled and trebled itself in the mir-
rored walls of the ballroom. Occa-
sional bursts of distant guns and the
roar of too nearby cannons rever-
berated down the aisles,

Associate Professor Marvin T. Her-
rick, of the English department, who
has studied and taught and partici-
pated in dramatic work for many
years, will write a synopsis and crit-
icism for the next issue of the Pitt
News.

After the production last evening
those actors and technicians who
were responsible for the show, cleaned
off their grease paint, stacked away
the scenery and joined their other
Pitt Player friends in a supper party
at the hotel.

Effluvia

“A Subtle Emanation”
By Saul Weisberg A

Editor’s Note:——The opinions expressed in this col-
umn are the personal views of the writer and are
not to be taken to be in conformance with the edi-
torial policy of the Pitt News.

HETHER IT WAS TRUE OR NOT, the report
. published lately that several Japanese airplanes had
been shot down by the Russian defenses on the Siberian
border may be taken as an indication of the tension that
exists between. the Soviet and Nippon at present. It is
on this Siberian border, in northern Asia, that we ﬁnd
the real tinderbox of the world, ready to blaze, through
a mere spark, into a new world conﬂagration.

The Japanese militarists are in control of the Ja-
panese government and there is no other group of men,
including Hitler and his associates, who are looking for-
ward to war more avidly. The Russian rulers are, on
the other hand, still desirous of peace as they have been
for the past ﬁfteen years. Thus, the Russians have been
attempting for quite a while to obtain a non-aggression
pact with Japan, but the Japanese have refused to coop-
erate. The Soviets know very well that they are, hardly,
as yet ready for armed conﬂict. Yet, they have reached
the stage when they are beginning to feel more conﬁdent
of their might, and they are not quite so ready as they
have been in the past to give way before Japanese
threats.

JAPAN REALIZES, OF COURSE that the longer it ab-
stains from conﬂlct with Russia, the more chance
Russia has to conquer it. The Russian air ﬂeet is still
not as large or well equipped as it should be and their
industrial outﬁt is still faulty in many ways. But the
Russian air ﬂeet is growing ever larger and the tech-
nological equipment is becoming better and better.

Japan has always been afraid of the action of the
United States in case of war with Russia. But the
American government has repeatedly given the Japanese
government assurances that it is not interested in aiding
any country which takes part in an Asiatic conﬂict.
Russian recognition by the United States will not change
this decision of the United States, which may be taken
as being sincere, and will not deter the Japanese from
war.

The main purpose of Japan, of course, is to wrest from
Russia northern Siberia, thus gaining for Japan complete
control a.nd domination in the Far East, at least until
China makes some advances. Russia. will never permit

such a huge chunk of territory to be taken fromher’

without putting up a desperate struggle. And such a.
struggle seems likely to be needed if Japan persists in

l

l

her intentions of making her islands and her position on
the Asiatic mainland secure. It must be remembered,
also, that Japan suffers from overpopulation and that
she needs extra territory. The Nipponese islands have
more than 65 million people concentrated in an area of
150,000 square miles, which is about the size of the
state of Montana.

HE MILITARY OLIGARCHY WHICH dominates Ja-

pan, at present, is supported by the almost fanatical-
ly patriotic Japanese religion, Shintoism. And the im-
perialistic forces derived from the extensive industrial
technique in the islands have been a basic factor in
driving Japan towards war.

The Japanese people are poverty-stricken and desti-
tute to an even greater extent, perhaps, than the work-
ers in the rest of the world. There have been many re-
ports of persons starving to death in Japan, even while
great industrialists have been receiving huge incomes.
There is also a strong revolutionary movement there, as
a result of the terrible conditions. But the Japanese
government with customary ferocity has repressed any
liberal or radical revolts. The poverty and the .radical-
ism of Japan is another force driving Japan towards
war. The militarists feel that, through a war, they can
arouse the patriotism of the people and get the support
of the masses. This is an old trick of the ruling classes,
of course. But it is dangerous, also, since, if the war
takes a long period, the people may easily revolt.

As a result of the various conditions in Japan, the
Nipponese militarists have been waging an aggressive
campaign against Russia. Russia is ﬁnally showing
signs of resistance. At present, each country is reported
to have massed over 100,000 soldiers at the Siberian bor-
der. And when rival forces oppose each other across a
border, anything may happen to cause open hostilities.

Thus, despite all the talk of war in Europe, the Sibe-
rian border ‘and events transpiring there is the place to
watch and study. For it is there that war is most likely
to come. And it is there that a new World VVar is most
likely to start.

Lamp-post

By Wilbur D. Clark

Dear Mister:

I am writing this to you in order
that you may know the anguish you
are causing the members of our
Council. You have undoubtedly heard
of our -Council; you may have even
met some of us. We are known as
The Council For the Fostering of
Better Taste and work for the best
interest of humanity. VVe believe that
no one except the members of our
Council has good taste, but we are
trying by divers methods, such as
this, to educate the public, and hope
that in time we will in part, at least,
accomplish our purpose. For cen-
turies our guild has been working
towards this end, but the public is
awfully ignorant, even as you, mister,
and so far we have found it necessary
to take in as members those few
persons we ﬁnally educate to the
principles of good taste, because all
the time we are getting older, and
occasionally some of us die. But any-
how, mister, I want to point out
some of the things that you do in
your column that keep the members
awake nights,

Inasmuch as I have not a lot of
time to write this. I can mention only
a. few things. Your last column about
the man in the bath tub was terrible.
The Council rooms were ﬁlled with
groaning on this account. You
shouldn’t write about people in bath
tubs, mister. It isn’t nice. Right now
I can’t take the time. to explain why
it isn’t, but the Council is praying
that your next columniwill be of a
more discreet nature.

About your sentence, “Or the Sat-
urday afternoons at Cloe Dam with
the creek chasing down, splashing
over rocks and fallen logs, under a.
screen of rhododendrons, ﬁlling the
valley with the silence of rushing
water.” Mister, it is terrible! The
Council weeps. We have decided that
in the ﬁrst place you can’t ﬁll a.
valley with anything. For instance,
suppose that you ﬁll a valley full of
water. Then you no longer have a
valley; instead you have a lake. You
get it, mister? Also, we can’t under-
stand how rushing water could make
so much silence. You just can’t say
that, mister, because our Council says
it isn’t good taste, and after all when
men like we are devote our entire
life to this work, we ought to know
what good taste is. Don’t you think
so? We do.

“Midnight skiing trips to the sum-
mit of Corry’s Round Top, for in-
stance, when the quiet of the snow
made you sure that there must be a.
God.” That is another sentence which
the Council thinks is terrible, It is
sloppy and sentimental, mister. Don’t
do that any more.

The Council wishes to thank you in
advance for the attention we are sure
you will give this letter. We are sorry
that we don’t like anything about your
column. But if you would just: do
like we say, mister, then you would
have good taste, and some one be-
sides your mother would read Be-
tween You, Me and the Lamp‘ Post.

Yours, for better taste, ‘

Tommy Rot, Sec’y.

Rivalry!

Three Members Of Same
Family In Race
For Ph.D’s

 

 

Who’s going to be the ﬁrst doc-
tor in the family? ,

That’s what all the rivalry is
about in the psychology testing
class on Saturday when Chester
B. Story and his son, Chester, Jr.,
graduate assistant in the psychol-
ogy department, get together.

Mr. Story, a professor of Eng-
lish at Schenley high, is out to
garner his Ph.D. ahead of his two
sons. A graduate of Tufts, he al-
ready has an M.A. and six or
seven credits for his doctor’s.

But Mr. Story, Jr., says the
head of the family doesn’t have a.
chance. Though still working on
his M.A., he is conﬁdent that his
work as graduate assistant will
soon enable him to forge ahead.

And then there’s Winthrop
Story, who has just received a.
B.S. degree from Tufts. He’ll
be in the running next semester
when he enrolls at Pitt as an en-
gineering student.

-Carlson’s Cagers
Work For Opener
With Georgetown

 

Annual Basketball Clinic For
College And High School
Coaches To Be Staged

To Open December 9

With the football season very deﬁ-
nitely on the wane and December 9
barely around the corner, the Pitt
hopes for the coming basketball cam-
paign are hard at work every even-
ing upon the Stadium ﬂoor. The
cagers are not in the habit of inaug-

urating their season against set-up
opposition and the opening COIII9-St
with Georgetown’s Hoyas isn't any
exception. To make it tougher still,
the home lads will be performing be-
fore a large group of high school and
college ﬂoor coaches after staging
demonstrations for these guests in the
morning and afternoon at the annual
basketball clinic.

None of the 20 varsity aspirants
has lost sight of this tough starting
assignment, if the seriousness of their
work in the practice sessions is any
indication. The boys seem less
chipper this year than before, but
they are sinking their shots with
regularity and the passing is excel)-
tionally “hot" for so early in the sea-
son.

Thus far, Coach Carlson has con-
ﬁned his sessions to a variety Of
games which emphasize the all—im-
portant fundamentals of bal1—handling,
dribbling, and shooting. “Now is the
time to improve,” is Carlson's advice.
Four groups of ﬁve men each have
been competing in these games, with
the winning group earning the right
to use the “new ball” in the succeed-
ing game. Carlson and his assistant,
George Kowallis, have lost no time,
however, in giving the basketeers a
very thorough grounding in the Pitt
system.

Just who will comprise the ﬁrst
team is, at present, problematical. To
date, there has been only a haphazard
grouping of men for the series of
games. A group composed of Cribbs,
Wainio, Hughes, Ochsenhirt, and Wil-
son has been doing a great deal of
playing with the “new ball,” while the
combination of Mccamant, Kuno,
Noon, Roderick, and Patrick runs it
some very stiff competition.

While it is just a bit early to fore-
cast anything, it might be well to
watch the two towering aspirants for
the center job, Cribbs and Noon,
when the scrimmages get under way.
Cribbs was the varsity pivot man last
year and did a creditable job. Noon
was a satellite on the frosh outﬁt but,
of course, he cannot rival Cribbs’ ex-
perience, Nevertheless, the play of
these two giants will bear watching.

Nebraska Game

 

 

(Continued From Page One.)
for the Turkey Day clash with Car-
negie Tech.

The big shot on the Nebraska team
this year, as has been mentioned many
times, is a fellow by the name of
Sauer, a 190-pound fullback who gave
the Panthers plenty of trouble in their
scoreless tie at Lincoln last year and
who this year is up to his old tricks.
Two other Nebraska bids for All-
American honors this year are Master-
son, quarterback, and Kilbourne, the
receiving end of the Husker passing
attack.

It you were one of the betting fra-
ternity (not a new one on the campus)
you probably would not be able to
get better than even money on the
Panthers for tomorrow's game. The
Cornhuskers were tough enough to
hold a great Pitt team scoreless last
year. Whether they are able to beat
just as great a Pitt team is the ques-
tion to be settled tomorrow.

Tomorrow For Eastern Meet

 

Tomorrow night at midnight, the
Pitt cross-country men will board a
train for New _York, where they will
compete Monday in the Intercollegi-
ate association of amateur athletes of
America cross-country runs.

Coach Olson is expecting to take
the following men: Wagenhouser,
Albright, Kirkpatrick, Lawrence, Mu-
sico, Watkins, Cook, and 'I‘ost. Tost
will compete in the freshman event.
Manager Di Marche will accompany
the team.

The Panther harriers are in splen-
did condition for their biggest test.
The injured leg which hampered
Wagenhouser in the recent Tech meet
is no longer causing the Pitt star any
trouble. The rest of the boys are in
good trim. Olson has been pushing
the runners this week in practice ses-
sions which have been ‘devoted to
shorter distances and more speed.
Gloves and sipple-caps have been wel-

year, will head the list of 224 entries

vania will enter a one-man team and
that man will be none other than

teams, they came out of the game with a loss, for that sector, of two yards.
Skladany only played a portion of the Centre game, but found the Colonels
willing to try his end four times. Final score, Skladany ahead by three
yards. Duquesne, unbeaten and untied, made the same mistake six teams had
made previously. The Dukes were willing to try ﬁve running plays around
Skladany. A Duke fumble, recovered by Skladany, and costing the Dukes 10
yards, boosted his total to the day to 12 yards ahead. The Dukes were
“sold short."

The ﬁgures quoted above do not include the tackles made by Skladany-
while backing up guards and tackles, as well as the secondary on occasions-

It is quite possible that Skladany’s total would be much better if the aux-
iliary tackling were taken into account. However, the ﬁgures show:

Number of attempts around Skladany’s end . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 67

Net yardage lost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 281/;

Therefore, even counting the Minnesota gain, Skladany is still ahead by at
least 3% yards. Won’t someone please take notice!

Prediction of the Week

Nebraska has its usual good material plus something missing in the
past, brains. The Huskers are plenty smart and have power to spare. Pitt
may be minus the services of Mike Sebastian, and may be due for a let-down
that would be fatal. In addition, the Huskers have too much to lose to ta.ke

If you are nervous . . . inclined
to “ﬂy off the handle”. . . change
to Camels. Your own nerves and
taste will conﬁrm the fact that
