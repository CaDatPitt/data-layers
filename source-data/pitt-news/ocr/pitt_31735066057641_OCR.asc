While some Pitt stu-
dents gained quick
boosts of power during
their lunchtime meal at
the William Pitt Union,
others gained power

them for the rest of
their lives. The power
to vote.

At the Student

meeting last night,

members discussed the
voter—registration pro-
ject, which began yes-
terday and will continue
throughout this week.

Board member Andy
Wuertele said the pro-
ject is a national func-
tion started by the
National Student
L e a d e r s h i p

' Foundation.

“They are trying to
get as many students
registered as possible
because legislators and
politicians generally do
not pay attention to stu-
dent concerns,”
Wuertele said.

Board member Julie
Crowell announced that
99 Pitt students regis-
tered in the first day of
the drive, and said she
hopes to have similar
success throughout the
week.

“If we could have a
hundred or more stu-
dents register each day,
it would be wonderful,”
Crowell said.

Speaker relives performing abortion

By Aimee Paquette
For The Pitt News

As a young student in medical school, Dr.
Henry Van Zanten was learning the ropes for
becoming a man who would save lives. What
he didn’t realize was that in his effort to save
lives, he would be asked to take away a life —

a life he would never forget.-

“There I was, a few inches away from a
young lady whose baby was about to have its
life snuffed out,” said Zanten, a family doctor
currently practicing medicine at Sharon
Regional Hospital in Mercer County.

The Pitt student organization Students for
Life featured Zanten at their meeting last night,

Zanten graduated from Temple Uni,versity’s
medical school and later went on to do post-

graduate work at Albert Einstein Medical
Center in northern Philadelphia.

During his training at Albert Einstein, Zanten
was asked by a resident student to perform an
abortion. Zanten performed a prostagland abor-
tion. which involves using suppositories to

induce the uterus to contract. A few hours later,

which was held in the William Pitt Union.

AIS provides options for scholars

By Linda Wisniewski
For The Pitt News

For a Pitt professor, communi-
cating with over 6,000 people
from all over the world in one
day will soon simply be busi-
ness as usual.

The Association for
Information Systems is a profes-
sional society trying to promote
the development of technology
by holding its organizational
meetings over the Internet.

“I consider myself the epicen-
ter of this organization,” said

William King, a business school
professor and one of the group’s
founders. '

The association is aimed
toward business school scholars
and has its headquarters at the
University of Pittsburgh’s
Joseph M. Katz Graduate School
of Business.

The AIS plans to affiliate with
existing national, regional and
special interest organizations of
information systems academics
and to promote the development
of such organizations.

“In this way, we can achieve

global goals while addressing
local interests and issues,” said
King.

The organizing committee,
comprised of 45 academics from
15 countries, uses the Internet to
discuss a constitution and
bylaws for the society.

“Our nomination committee,
which is in charge of finding
members, is mailing out approx-
imately 6,000 member solicita-
tions,” said King. “In fact, we
just received our ﬁrst application
back this morning.” ’

the fetus was born and Zanten went back to the
room where he had performed the abortion,
only to realize that the baby was still alive.
“The child that I was involved with was
tossed into a garbage can, seizuring and gasp-
ing for air,” Zanten said.
Zanten said he had difficulty accepting the

Candidate
for Congress
discusses
Contract
with America
ByAmyFmk

W, 

Republican candidate for
the U.S. Congress John
McCar/ty discussed the
signing of a contract with
America last evening at the
meeting of the College
Republicans.

Republicans have a great
opportunity this year to_
capture the State House,
State Senate and the
Governor’s Office, accord-
ing to McCarty. For the
first time in 48 years,
Republicans have a chance
to gain the majority of the
40 seats available.

According to McCarty,

“If all forty seats are filled
by the Republicans, the
Contract of America states
that in the first 100 days,
they will approve several
reforms.”
- The first thing McCarty
said they would do would
be to make Congress sub-
ject to the same laws to
which all citizens are sub-
ject. Currently, members of
Congress are exempt from
some laws.

One of the goals for
McCarty is to get people
out there to vote.
According to research, only
35 percent turned out to
vote in the last election.

“We want to push for
meaningful term limits, to
limit the terms of congress-
men,” said McCarty.

McCarty has certain
issues on his agenda.

CAP-HAITIAN, Haiti —
Haitians danced in the streets last
week when lights twinkled on
for the first time since New
Year’s Day, but it will be very
difficult to move from that sym-
bolic gesture to a dependable
electric grill. .

As soon as the U.S. military
provided diesel fuel, the lights --
or at least some of them — did
switch on, providing a change a
businessman described as “psy—
chological.”\ Electricity was last
provided for a few hours on

PANAMA CITY — Dozens of
Cuban refugeesin the Panama
camps, where the United States

holds about 3,000 boat people

near the U.S.—run Panama Canal,
launched a hunger strike over the
weekend to demand that the
United States grant them asylum.

As many as 96 refugees had
stopped eating Saturday,

although only half remained on
strike by Sunday, according to
U.S. military officials in charge
of supervising the camps.

The refugees are angry at
President Clinton’s policy —
aimed at discouraging future
waves of Cuban boat people —
that the refugees must return to
Cuba to apply for legal emigra-
tion to the United States. —

WASHINGTON — Jordan and
Israel agreed Monday to a vari-

development undertakings to
further their move toward a
peace treaty, President Clinton
said.

“They have agreed to adopt
basic principle to guide the future
development of the Jordan
Valley including projects dealing
with the environment, water,
energy and tourism, to open a
new northern border crossing for
third-country nationals by Oct.
15, to establish a Red Sea Marine
Peace Park with assistance from

Clinton said after White House

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti —
An American soldier was shot in
the stomach in an exchange of
gunfire outside a military com-
pound in the southern coastal
town of Les Cayes, said the com-
mander of the U.S. forces in
Haiti, Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton.

It marks the first time an
American soldier has been

wounded in Haiti since 20,000 W

U.S. troops began arriving two
weeks ago to restore democracy.
The special forces soldier
was reported to be in stable con-
dition after surgery.

Shelton said the soldier was
approached by armed men
Sunday evening as he went to
the bathroom. The soldier was
hit by one shot and fired back,
apparently killing two Haitians.

vice that seems to be abused.
McCarty said, “It is meant to
give people a helping hand
while they bounce in and out
of the system.”

Government has to nurture
them until they are able to
get along independently.
Once they receive their jobs,
their benefits will slowly
decline as their finances
strengthen.

Pro—family reform . is
another priority. According
to McCarty, he will enco'ur- C
age adoption and marriage.

“Right now, married cou-

 

ples that have two incomes
pay more taxes than a couple
who just live together. We
need people to be a family,”
said McCarty.

College Republican mem-
bers had concerns on other
issues. One member wanted
to know McCarty’s opinion
about illegitimacy. McCarty
responded that if teenagers
were living at home while
theyraised children, there
should be no reward from the
government. .

“We shouldn’t be reward-

- ing people for irresponsible
behavior,” said McCarty.

According to McCarty,
people on welfare have a
responsibility to the govern-
ment to try and get back into
the workforce and to educate
their children so that they do
not make the same mistakes.
There has to be a way to get
people out of poverty. -

Another member of the
College Republicans asked if
he was considering reform of
Social Security.

The government says that

‘by the year 2026, Social

Security will not exist.
McCarty said the Social
Security fund is part of

the nation’s general revenue.
It could be dangerous if
it becomes a separate
trust fund, because taxes
would rise and/or govern-
ment would have to

cut spending somewhere.

else.

Vice president of the
College Republicans Jarrod
Caruso said, “I thought that
he handled the questions
well. He has good ideas ‘for
different reforms.”

McCarty closed his speech
with an announcement
about volunteers campaign-

ing forthe Republican plat-

form.
According to James
Everlof, president of

the College Republicans,
“McCarty sends a strong
message of reform to the
political process in
Pittsburgh, and it is helping
to get the Republican mes-

sage across to the closet con-

servatives.”
The club is focusing’ on the
overall national, state

and local elections, and after
November the group said
it plans to spread the

conservative word around

campus. -

concept that life was being
born in one room while life
was being taken away in
another. -

“As one baby was being
born from a cesarean, another
was being aborted,” Zanten
said. “It’s simple. One baby
was wanted; one baby
wasn’t.”

Although Zanten described
the experience as negative, he
said that he has made the best
out of it and that it has encour-
aged him to become involved
in the pro-life movement. .

Zanten began demonstrating
his pro—life concern in 1988
when he attended the March
for Life event in Washington,
D.C. Shortly after returning
from the march, Zanten was
elected chairman for Mercer
County’s Pro-Life group,

where he served for three—

years.
After relating his personal

experience with abortion,
Zanten went on to explain his
concerns for the future of the
pro—life movement. He said he
would like to see more
involvement in the political
aspect.

“We haven’t made a whole
lot of progress,” he said. “We
need to be persistent.”

Zanten compared the pro-
life movement to that of the
abolition movement in the
mid-eighteen hundreds. He
said it took 100 years before
anything was accomplished,
so there is hope for the pro-
life movement.

“We need patience for
something big to happen,” he
said.

Zanten concluded the meet-
ing with a message for the
members of Students for Life.
“Hang fast with your convic-
tions, stand strong and stand
up for what you believe in,”
he said.

King said most professional
societies started before comput-
ers were used as widely as they
are today. “We plan to make this
a global organization,” he said.

Using computers will elimi-
nate the problem of coping with
time differences between coun-
tries and will make it possible to
communicate with thousands of
people on the same day, which
could not be done through con-
ference calls.

“Language differences are not
an issue,’.’ said King. “Almost
all business schools operate in

English.”

“The idea for this organiza-
tion started two years ago. The
actual work started about a year
ago,” he said.

The organizing committee
plans to meet here in Pittsburgh
in the near future and would
like to develop a vision for the
future by enhancing opportuni-
ties for members and by creat-
ing an identity for information
systems academics.

The organization publishes its
own journal and would like to
remain a “free-standing” associ-
ation.

In addition to voter—registra-
tion, SGB President Pro-
Tempore Elizabeth Mania dis-
cussed the topic for the first
President’s Council Meeting.
The meeting will focus on
public safety and sexual
assault and will include mem-
bers of all campus governance
groups.

Mania said the topic for the
meeting was sparked by an
editorial written in The Pitt
News last week. The editorial

discussed the lack of coopera- .

tion between campus groups,
particularly the Campus
Women’s Organization and
the Department of Public
Safety.

“When we saw this editorial
in The Pitt News, we felt the
President’s Council was the
exact forum where we could
address these concerns,”

Mania said. “Everybody
agrees that we all want to
work together and prevent
any conflict in the future.”

In addition, SGB announced
Pitt’s new Governmental

Leibowitz. Also, SGB

Homecoming is outdated

Well, it's that time of year again, when Pitt’s campus is inun-
dated with black and white cardboard signs with the picture of
some beautiful person on them ——- a person who will strangely
grow a mustache and new hair style in the near future. Yes, we
are referring to the Homecoming election, that time-honored tra-
dition which is in reality little more than a Greek popularity con-
test.

Isn’t a homecoming election more appropriate for high school,
where it actually meant something and people cared about it?
Granted homecoming elections in high school are largely popu-
larity contests as well, but at least in high school it is possible
for everyone to know who these people are. In college, we
oftentimes see posters of people whom we have never seen
before or will ever see again. Furthermore, there is nothing else
on these signs but the person’s face. Is this nothing more than a
beauty contest?

And what is the purpose of this contest other than fraternity
and sorority bragging rights? What do these people do other
than stand at midfield during halftime of a football game? It is
time for Pitt to either get rid of the Homecoming King and
Queen elections or to change the format, basing victory on more
criteria than simply facial beauty and the popularity of your par-
ticular Hellenic organization, and giving more duties and
responsibilities to the eventual winners.

SGB elections important

And now for elections of a different nature  the Student

Government Board elections are rapidly approaching (vote on
Wednesday, Nov. 9). An advertisement ran in yesterday’s The
Pitt News stating that petition packets, for anyone interested in
running for election, are now available in 639 ‘William Pitt
Union, with a deadline of Oct. 14.
‘ The Pitt News strongly urges anyone with any desire to run
for Student Government Board or SGB President to go pick up
these information packets. A large number of people compet-
ing for SGB is very healthy, especially for a university the size
of Pitt. Last year was a strong year for student elections with
six people running for president and 14 for board, and it would
be ideal if we could build on that momentum. Past years have
too often been noted for the lack of attention and interest in
Student Government elections.

Having a large field forces the candidates to work harder to
get elected. This accomplishes a number of things. First of all,
it tends to insure that a dedicated person is elected to the
Board. Furthermore, the ‘elected person will in turn learn more
about Pitt itself and be a better board member or president if
they identify themselves with particular issues in order to get
elected.

All in all, a high interest in Student Government elections
can only help Pitt by promoting interest and involvement in
student and university affairs.

A private little war for Big Bill

t a recent meeting in?
the Oval Office, a new
staff member meets

the President of the United
States.

“Mr. President, this is
Jimmy Smith. He’s our new
Assistant to the Assistant
Vice-Assistant of White
House Assistants.”

“Fine, Leon. Nice to meet
you, Jimmy. I’m sure you’ll
make a strong addition to our
team. Now, fellas, let’s get
down to business. First thing
on the agenda is Haiti.”

“Yes sir, Mr. President.
Looks like President Carter

“Ex-President, Leon! Ex-
President! Make sure you
remember that!”

“Sorry, sir. Ex-President
Carter seems to have put a
damper on our plans in Haiti.”

“Dosh-garn that guy, any-
way. First we make a swell
plan to make war against
Korea and he butts in and
spoils everything. Now he
ruins our chance to invade
Haiti. Planes in the air, ready
to strike and ...” the President
blows a raspberry. “Nothing.
Not a shot fired. He arranges a
peaceful solution. Phooey.”

“Yeah. What’s that guy up
to anyway? Campaigning for
the Nobel Peace Prize or
something?”

“Really. The nerve of that
guy!” «

“Well, he’ll be out of my
hair for a little while, at least.
Sent him back to Korea.”

“Brilliant, sir. Now’s our
chance to pull a big one off.”

“Yeah, Iguess. We’ll have

‘ to shelve‘ Haiti, though. Here,

Smith, put this in one of our
policy baskets, will you?”

Smith whispers to the man
next to him, “Which one? The
‘Positively-Always-Yes’ bas-
ket or the ‘Absolute1y-Never-
No’ basket?”

“What are you, a wise guy?
Either one. He’ll just shuffle
the stuff from one basket into
the other, tomorrow.”

“Quiet guys, please. This is
bad, fellas. How’m I supposed
to look like a strong, macho
President without a good war?
I mean, Bush had the Gulf
War and look what it did for
him!”

“But sir, he lost to you.”

“Right, but during the war
he was really popular.
Approval ratings through the

O roof. He just mis-timed the

war, that’s all. If he waited a
bit longer, we’d never have
been able to beat him. Look,
he had the Gulf. Reagan got to
bomb Libya and invade

Grenada. Carter, well  say,

he didn’t do anything like that,
did he?”

“No sir. Just that botched
rescue attempt in Iran.”

“Right. And he didn’t win
re-election, either. Heck,
Reagan might have won a
third term if they’d let him run
again. Dadgum it, we’ve got
too many congressional seats
on the line this November. We
need a boost, a good military

action.”
“Sir? You did have
Somalia.”
“Sorry, Mr. President.

Smith’s new here. He doesn’t
know any better.”

“Okay Leon. Just don’t let
him use the ‘S’ word again.
Any other suggestions?
C’mon guys, think!’

“What about Bosnia, sir?”

“No, that’s no good. Too
complicated. Even we have a
hard time keeping track of
who’s fighting who. We need
something clearer, simpler.”

“Rwanda?”

“No way! More starving
Africans? What are you, nuts?
Not after  Well, you know.
No, someplace else. Hey, any
chance that this Quebec seces-
sion thing could heat up
soon?”

“Probably
November, sir.”

“Too bad. Wait a minute.
What about the baseball
strike?”

“Our timing’s off, sir. We’d

not before

be too late. Now that football
season’s started, nobody
seems to care about baseball.”

“Sir! I think I’ve got it!”

. “Out with it, please.”

“Well, the hockey players
are considering a strike.”

“That’s perfect! Any chance
Carter could get involved,
there?”

“I don’t think ice hockey’s
too big in Georgia, sir.”

“Great! Should be an easy
victory, too. They’re almost as
poorly armed as the Haitians
were. Just those hockey sticks
and a few pads.”

“Gee sir, our dashing young
soldiers up against those ugly
brutes  It’ll look great on
CNN.” »

“If there’s any pictures shot,
make our guys all have nice
teeth, will you? It’ll make a
good contrast.”

“I’ll have the Joint Chiefs
draw up battle plans, sir.”

“Excellent, Leon. Make sure
they’re thorough, too. Those
hockey players look like a
rough bunch.”

“Yes sir. At least that
Lemieux isn’t playing this
season. He’s supposed to be
pretty slippery.”

“Sir?”

“Yes, Smith? What is it, this
time?”

“The hockey players, sir‘...
well, their uniforms are so col-
orful. Maybe we could perk
up those drab green army uni-
forms. lt’d make better video,
s1r.”

“Great idea, Jimmy. You
know, I think you’ll fit right in
up here.”

“Thanks, sir.”

“Leon, draft a memo: New
uniforms. Flashy, maybe red,
white and blue. The public
will eat it up. See if we can get
whoever redesigned the New
England Patriots’ uniforms.
Yee-haw! This election’s in
the bag now, right fellas?”

“Check, sir.”

Defense
plays   role
of great
provider

thing
can

  
 

J .
 be said

\ about Pitt’s
defense —
they certain-
ly are a gen-
erous group
of young
men, espe-
cially when
it comes to the opposing
team’s running backs.

Each game, barring
the barely Division I
Ohio Bobcats when the
Pitt defense held their run-
ning back Lakarlos
Towrisend to 53 yards, the
Panthers have been more
than fortuitous to the other
backs.

The fact of the matter is
the Panthers step on the field
and magically turn an aver-
age running back into a
Heisman Trophy candidate
—- or so it seems.

Dating back to the first
game of the year against a
pass-oriented Texas
Longhorn squad, Texas ran
Pitt into the ground. The two
Longhorn backs, Rodrick
Walker and Anthony
Holmes, humiliated Pitt for
189 rushing yards.

“As a man and as a
defense, we have to take it
personally,” linebacker
Jason Chavis said. “It’s a
slap in the face. We have to
stop the run. Any team that
can run on you, will run on
you.”

Week two against Ohio
State, a team that was sup-
posed to be in flux about its
running attack, ran through,
over and around the Panther
defense for a total of 295
rushing yards. Tailback
Eddie George, who entered
OSU coach John Cooper’s
doghouse in the previous
game against Washington,
rushed for 126 yards.

It seems that Pitt’s. run
defense stumbled into the
title of the great provider
and can’t seem to shake it.

Against Boston College’s
less than mediocre tailback
David Green, Pitt’s defense
continued the gracious trend.
Green, who rushed for 168
yards in the three games
prior to the Pitt game, ran
for 186 yards and averaged
over five yards a carry.

“It’s not basically just the
running backs,” Chavis said.
“I think it’s a lot with us on
defense, us making mis-
takes. If we make mistakes,

By Keith Pompey

Senior Sports Writer

.Curtis Martin leads a long
listof Panthers who are falling
by the wayside due to injuries.
Martin, currently fifth on the
Pitt career rushing list with
2,361 yards, might be kissing
this season goodbye.

“He is out indefinitely at this
present time,” Pitt head coach
Johnny Majors said. “It’s some

i complications and he is out

indefinitely. There is no other
way to tell you anything dif-
ferent from the prognosis.
From the estimation from the
doctors report I got this morn-
ing, he is out for certain.”
Martin, the senior tailback,

seriously injured his right,

American candidate has been
recently spotted limping

Women's

Clarion

By Tawnya Adams
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s tennis
team was in good spirits last
night after sweeping its sin-
gles matches against Clarion
University at the Cost Center,
winning the match 7-2.

“We played real strong sin-
gles today,” head coach
George Dieffenbach said.

Tammy Keister was still
suffering from an injured
wrist, but she gritted it out to
win her match 6-1, 6-0.

“I put the injury out of my
head to win my singles
match. I was determined to
win this week, because I lost
last week,” Keister said as
she laid on the floor with ice
on her wrist.

Fran Davis, a freshman
who is 7-0 this season, sealed
her win by sweeping the
match in two sets, 6-0, 6-0.

“I hit my ground strokes‘

well, and my serve was on.

“He is a great player,” Pitt
linebacker Jason Chavis said.
“He is a great friend. We have
known each other since we
were little. He is really frus-
trated going through this, and
I’m just going to try to support
him. I really do hope he does
the best thing for him. The
team comes first, but Ijust
hope he does the best thing for
himself.”

Other Panthers who are suf-
fering from injuries this season
are Tom Tumulty, Daryl Cash,
Curtis McGhee and Mark
Butler.

Tumulty, a Butkus Award
candidate who is currently
leading the Panthers with 61
tackles, suffered a bruisedleft

of Saturday’s loss to
Louisville.

Despite leaving the game
early, Tumulty, the backbone
of the Panther defense, man-
aged to record nine tackles.

“Whenever a Tom Tumulty

Men score

big at
Eastern
Michigan
Invitational

By Tawnya Adams
For The Pitt News

The long trip to the Eastern
Michigan Invitational this past
weekend gave the men’s tennis
team a better idea of where
they stand.

The men won six singles
matches against strong schools
in the Mid—American
Conference.

“It was very strong competi-
tion. It gave [us] a much better
idea of where we stand within
our team,” head coach George
Dieffenbach said.

The men are 3-0 in their sea-
son, but this weekend was the
true test. They played some of
the _top players in the MAC,
and this was good experience
for them, said Dieffenbach.
The first match of their season

Dismantlecl Piﬂ lacrosse team stumbles in Chic

By Jerry Klayman
For The Pitt News

The Pitt lacrosse team trav-
eled to Ohio this weekend to
compete in the sixth annual
Wing Invitational Lacrosse
Tournament. The tournament
is a time for the teams to get
together and play before the
start of the regular season,
which is in the spring.

The fourth—seeded Pitt team
held its own, but managed just
one win and three losses. Pitt’s
first opponent was the
University of Northern Illinois.

The Panthers prevailed, 9-7.
Sixth—year head coach Gary
Neff said of the victory, “Last
year’s team would have had
less difficulty with Northern
Illinois. I’m glad the team
came together and pulled out
the victory.”

In the Panthers’ second-
round game, their opponents
were the Kentucky Wildcats.
This time, the team was not as
fortunate and succumbed to
Kentucky’s over—powering
defense. The Wildcats scored
five times while the Panthers
managed just two scores.

In the consolation game on
Sunday, Pitt suffered a heart-
breaking loss to the Purdue
Boilermakers, 5-4.

During the tournament,
many Pitt players shined.
Outstanding performances
were turned in by senior Matt
Shea and junior Dave Walters.
Shea scored three times
against Purdue on Sunday and
finished with six in the tourna-
ment. Walters had four scores
of his own. Senior captain
Luke Fox had an impressive
tournament on the defensive
side of the field.

“His defensive skills were
on display this weekend,”
teammate Pete O’Hara said.
“Luke is the heart and soul of
our team.’,’

Over the past three seasons,
the Panthers have turned in an
impressive record of 51 wins
to only seven defeats. The
team captured the national
championship two years ago.

Last season, the poor sched-
uling of the National
Collegiate Lacrosse League
officials kept the Panthers out
of the national championship
tournament. The tournament

was held during Pitt’s finals
week.

The Panther team that went
13-3 last season has been dis-
mantled. Losing 20 seniors to
graduation is the reason for the
rebuilding process. Fourteen of
the 18' players who played this
weekend were either of the
freshman or sophomore vari-
ety. Neff is very enthusiastic
about the team’s chances of
success this season.

“Our team had a very posi-
tive weekend. Right now, I’m
not really concerned about the
amount of wins that we post.
The experience that they are
getting is invaluable. It will
help us out in the future,” Neff
said.

Neff needs only 15 more
victories to pass the century
mark here at Pitt.

Neff can maximize his play-
ers’ abilities better than any-
one else.

For instance, Pete O’Hara
came to Neff as a freshman
and said that he wanted to play
lacrosse but had never played
before. O’Hara is going to start
this season.

The next home game for the
Panthers is scheduled for Oct.
23.

Wait, the list continues.

Last weekend against
Louisville, Anthony
Shelman, another no-name
back, scampered for 160
yards, 84 coming in one
touchdown run.

“I attribute that,” defen-
sive tackle Mike Halapin
said of the opposing run-
ning success, “to giving big
plays.”

A tough, but the other two against

Youngstown State and St.
Francis College were a little
easier.

Pitt’s No. 1 seeded player,
Braden Doherty, played Alan
Pintaric from DePaul
University. Doherty lost 6-2,
6-2, but made a big comeback
in his consolation match
against Eastern Miehigan’s
Derrick Dabbs, by winning 8-2.
His third match was won by
default.

The number two seed, Brad

. Wade, lost his first two matches

but pulled out a win, 8-0,

against Neil Raychaudhuri of
Eastern Michigan in his conso-
lation match.

Matt Mills showed his
integrity by fighting it out to
win his third match, 8-3,
against Bob Yonker of Bowling
Green University after losing
his first two matches.

Dieffenbach said this was a
good confidence builder for the
team because of the strong
competition they had. It will
help them mentally for the rest
of the season.

“The players are only as
good as the competition they
play,” Dieffenbach said.

The Pitt News, 'Iluesday, October 4, 1994

Tennis

‘From page 7

come out as well as the sin-
gles, for they are changing
partners and it will take time
for the partners to get used to
each other.

“Even though we only won
one of the three doubles
matches, I like how they
are playing," Dieffenbach
said.

“They are going to the net
and being very aggressive.”

The doubles team of Marla
Zielinski and Fran Davis won
6-4, 6-3. They are 2-0 in their
first season playing together.

“We closed out really well

at the net,” Zielinski said.

“We are getting used to
each other,” Davis added.

Alison Baker and Keister
didn’t come out ontop in
their doubles competition,
but this is understandable
since they played together for
the first time yesterday.

“We have to work on com-
plementing each other’s shots
more during practice,” Baker
said.

“We had a close matchwith
Clarion last year, but we
were more prepared this year
because we have more expe-
rience on the team,”

Dieffenbach said.

The women play Robert
Morris College today at 3:00
p.m. at the Cost Center.

“We are ready for Robert
Morris,” Zielinski said.

Dieffenbach said the sin-
gles aregood, but they will
keep working on the doubles
in practice. A

“I’m not worried about the
singles for the Robert Morris
match,” Dieffenbach said,
“but I think the doubles are
going to be a big factor. We
have to concentrate and be
very aggressive for them
tomorrow.” ~
