. -Dr. Carroll A. Whitmer, assis-
tant professor of psychology, has
given up his professorship at the
_University to become director of
special education for the Pitts-
burgh board of education. He will
continue to serve on the Univer-
sity faculty as a lecturer in psy-
chology.

New assistant professor in psy-

position was director of the be-

Once upon a time, the telephone
company got a marvelous idea.

They would tabulate the num-
ber of calls handled by the Uni-
versity switclﬁoard. A trained girl
was sent out to count the number
of calls.

The poor girl’ nearly went mad.‘
She finally sent for a helper. An-
other girl came, and as the day
wore on, they tore their hair to-
,gether. Finally, they left in des-
peration. The phone calls never
did get counted, and one more

good idea bit the dust.

There are only two women who
can tame the tangle of wires and
flashing red lights; Ann Flaherty
and Elizabeth Bodnar. Ann has
been at the switchboard - since
1917.

Each day, from 8:20 to 4:30,
they sit in room 358% and an-
swer, “Hello, University."

Except for the two brief periods
of registration each year, most of
the calls are for the school of ap-
plied social science, Ann claims;
but every» department gets its
shalre and it all adds up to a very
busy day. Still Ann does not com-
plain, because she says that there
are so many interesting calls. Some
people phone every morning just

by then I was a raving baseball fanatic who had

That is how Elaine Kahn, C44, believed to be
the only woman writer on men’s sports in the United
States, begins the prefaces to her “book” dedi-
cated to the Pittsburgh Pirates and presented re-
cently to Jimmy Long. ‘

Elaine started writing about baseball two years
ago when the editor of her high school paper at
Peabody could not ﬁnd anyone to cover a game.
It was an opportunity to prove that what she had
always argued was correct——girls can write about
men’s sports

And she proved it!

But that was not the end of

her struggle against the old prejudices against a girl_

Gazette knew she could do it, and he praised her

in his column. He also called the Pitt News to
tell them how good she was.

Elaine is an English major at the University;
but from'her freshman themes, which incidenttly
form the various chapters of her “book,” one
would judge that baseball still rates ﬁrst. She
admits, however, that she is not particularly good
at any sports herself. In fact, Elaine's gym grade
from high school is far lower than any other
marks in her record. .

At last we have found a girl who can talk sports
-—-and that should interest all you fellows who
complain because your dates can never keep up
an interesting conversation. Our only tip to you
before you go dating her is that youﬂetter know
your stuff, and not let her deﬁnitely feminine ap-
pearance fool you. Here's a girl who knows more
about baseball than the fact that Gustine is the
only bachelor on the Pirates team or that Thurs-
day is ladies’ day at Forbes Field.

Alex Zelenski’s only comment about her writ-
ing is, “Wow! She’s good-terriﬁc!”

'Jack de Benedictis, editor, says that she is
really a great ﬁnd, and that he would have never
imagined a girl could do it.

What does she want to do after she "gr duates?

At The Nikon

Chances are that there will be"

np laughter at all in the Nixon
next week. To replace the whacky
Ed VVynn, there an-j,ves on Mon-
day the stage adaptation of Rich-
ard Wright's “Native Son.”

The author clothed his novel,
not in wit but in violence, not
in comedy but in melodrama, and
with Orson Welles responsible for
the staging the play, we may
anticipate an exciting and proba-
bly not a little lurid tragedy.

The company comes here with
Canada Lee still in the title part.
Except for a brief excursion into
dramatics with the Federal The-
atre project when Mr. Welles was
staging the Negro version of “Mac-
beth,” Mr. Lee has had little ex-
perience as an actor. Most of his
time before "Native Son” was
spent in the rings of Brooklyn and
New Jersey ﬁght clubs.

Mr. Welles
from their association .. together
in the Negro “Macbeth." When
Welles began seeking a Negro
performer for the role of Bigger
Thomas in Mr. Wright’s play,‘ he
at once recalled the ‘powerfully
built Mr. Lee and entrusted to
him the difficult role.

Mr. Welles, who has not been
represented on the local theatri-
cal front since his touring ver-
sion of the modern “Julius Cae-

A_p0sses,')slin,g a mechanical type seismograph when the present plans of
fTDonalid}i‘C'. Bradford, head seismologist in the physics department,
* materialize ' in December.

,,Groundbreaking for the- new darthquake recorder was begun this
summer by the Building and Grounds department, and although the
“parts for the new graph are here and ready to be assembled, Brad-
forddoes npt expect the construction to be co'mpleted until Christ-

, mas recess.

“This is due, primarily, to the delicacy of the operation, for great
care must be taken in‘the placement of the instrument because of

Tits high zensitivity.

One improvement of the seismology depa1~t1i1ent.ew additi.on
 is that it will not necessitate a 24-hour delay in viewing the tremors

A stylus, much on the order of a long aluminum pen“ point bent
 ‘at its contact point, will be connected with a horizontal pendulum,

‘recording immediately on smoked paper all ground tremors at the

j moment -of their occurrence. Thispaper may be read easily as the

 lW"itl‘1l the present instruments earthquakes may not be known for Research Made 

s.loI'ig‘“as 24 hours after they occur.

Good Grades
Defer Students

Georgia selective service head-

work which i-s satisfactory to the
college and to the local board.”

Major Charles J. Brockman,

recommendation will include all
college students not yet placed in
classiﬁcation I-A.

Local boards already had been
authorized to defer students» tak-

lLdrge Squad Reports
LP or Swimming Drills

The outlook for a successful
swimming’ season is pretty good
according to Ben Grady, Panther
swimming coach. Grady said that
this year he has what he lacked
most last season,'men who are at
least willing to try to swim. Not
that last year’s squad didn’t try;
there just weren’t enough of them
onthe team.

\ Back from last year's varsity

W ujuad are Herb Cosgrove,'captain

dot the team this year, Gus Wilde,

Marty Kramer, Joe Orloﬂ’, Bob

V ‘Soles,.and Al Samson. Al Fedor

 would also have been among those

present had not Uncle Sam told

" him to be ready to enter the army
in about two weeks.

Freshmen Up

’About ten of last year’s fresh-
gnan squad are vieing for a var-
sity post. Among them are Jerry
Zaslov, Ralph Wilde, Hal Mason,
llsrael Grossman, Herb Krongold,
Joe Donahue, Steve Bilowich,
— _Vince Matera, and Sutnich.

Of the above, Jerry Zaslov is the
best prospect. He is fast and can
go for a fairly long time without
becoming exhausted. He probably
will be groomed for the long dis-
tance spot on the team. A

Bill McCaﬂ*‘erty, George Papada-
kos, Jackson, and Kaule give the
Panthers a fair diving squad. Also
there is a chance that one of last
yes-.1-’s freshmen may be good
enough to dive competitiveely.

Men Wanted

Grady emphasized the fact
that last season he didn't have
enough men, but now with more
than the minimum needed, he
said that he should be able to pre-
sent a better team than he had
last year.

Although he has a fairly large
squad out now, Grady stated that
he could always use more material.
Anyone interested in swimming
should report to him at the Trees
pool thi; afternoon at 3 :30 o’clock.

Mainstays ol Harrier Team

Working out daily at the track
house, high on the hill behind the
stadium, the Panther track team
is fast rounding into shape as they
prepare for their first meet of the
year.

The local cindermen open their
season against Michigan State, Oc-
tober 18. There is a possibility,
however, that another meet will be

scheduled before the tentative
opener with the Spartans.

The most promising men on the
squad thus far are captain John
Broslry, Bill Miller, Jim Saunders,
Ben Foote, and Bob Graham,
seniors; Marcus Allias and Bob
Davis, juniors; and sophomore
_Bill Curtis.

Saunders is the most improved
man on the team. The ﬁrst year

Bowser Has Tradition Plus Eleven

21" ootball Players On His Side Saturday

By ELAINE KAHN
There will be twelve players on
the team Charley Bowser sends
ibut against Purdue-on Saturday.
No, they haven’t changed the rules
‘again, nor is Mr. Bowser going to
 any of the accepted ones.
,”Just the same No. 12 is going to
be inﬂiere every minute of the

game, even though you won’t be
“able to see him. For No. 12 is
Jreither man nor mouse. No, he is
 not Yehudi. He is, however, going
to have a lot to say about who
"wins Saturday's contest. Wrong

‘fagain. He is not Nostradamus.
'_There’s a Draft

‘ No. 12 is Tradition. He is the
“tradition built around the fact
that in 34 home openings P1“

up to last year Pitt had never
lost an opening game anYWh°"°*
Only once has there been even
the slightest doubt that tradition
would fail to come through. Thls
rwas in 1933 when the Panthers
gngag-ed in a scoreless struggle
with W & J. There were only three

minutes left to play, and all seem-
ed lost, when Izzy Weinstock boot-
ed a perfect ﬁeld goal that gave
the Panthers 21 3-0 advantage. Tra-
dition had been saved! Exactly
two minutes later Howdy O’De1l
lent a dramatic ﬁnish to things by
dashing forty yards for a super-

F or Intramural Entries

Director James Potts, intramural
‘orogram head, announced today
that all entries for the fall compe-

tition must be in his office no later

’-than Wecln=1sday, October 8. First

games are scheduled to begin TueS—
day, October 14 in touch football,

tennis.

ed among the fraternity, en-

7 gineer, and independent leaS“°5-
Each one of these leagues will
operate independently until their
respective winners have been de-
‘ cided. The winners will then
proceed to playoffs to determine
the "intrampral champion.

Only Two Losses

In football, a team will be com-

posed of seven men and any num-

ber of reserves. Touch football

‘is scheduled in double elimination

ﬂights, which means that any team
losing two league games is auto-
matically out of any further com-
petition. Last season, the Punks,
~AE&ME, and Phi Gamma Delta
squads were declared winners in
their respective league.

In thirty-seven opening games
both here and abroad the Panthers
manag_ed to collect an amazing
total of 1052 points against a
feeble 66 for their opponents,
thirty of which were contributed
by Ohio State last year.

an awful kicking around since

ing pretty strong at the Stadium.

Oh, Gee, O"Dell
After looking at the records it
doesn’t seem as though Bowser
has to worry anymore about
Benghauser and the draft. He
doesn’t have to worry aboutVre-
placements for Konetsky and
Thurbon. ln fact, he doesn’t have

to worry about anything.

All he has to do is put the boys
out to graze in the Stadium next
Saturday at 2:30. Tradition will
do the rest.

point where he is today one of the

Coach Carl Olson announced
that a promising group of fresh-
men have already reported to him
and are being put through their
paces daily. However, as in other
years, Olson stated that he wants
everyone interested in running to
report to the trackhouse. Even if
no experience in the sport has been
