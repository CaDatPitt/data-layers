Students to beneﬁt from SGB fund surplus

By  Grieco
News Editor

Student Government Board Allocations
Chairman Gil Borok announced last week
that he has reached an agreement with
administration officials on how to use the
controversial reserve fund. There is $72,323
in the fund, almost twice as much as had
been estimated.

The SGB came under fire last year when
it was revealed that there was money
taken from student activity fees accumu-
lating in a bank account without any plans
from student government for its use. There
have been no expenditures from the fund
since the board bought a neon sculpture
for $30,000 in honor of Pitt's bicentennial
over two years ago. '

According to Borok, the fund was set

up “in case of a budget deficit, or for major
capital, expenditures. We still need the
fund for these reasons. However, we
should spend some of the money if there
is a large sum in theiaccount.”

Borok’s plan calls for a ceiling figure of
$50,000, so there is money if it is needed.
Once the fund has reached this amount,
however, the SGB can make a proposal
for the-use of the extra money.

“I’d like to see the extra $22,323 spent
on a special speaker,” Borok said. “It
could be anyone from Ronald Reagan to

«Johnny Carson. Of course, it is the board’s

decision.”

Because the money in the fund was
allocated to student groups but was not
spent, Borok said that there is no need for
a proportional increase for all groups, as
he had indicated earlier. He added that

because of this, he plans to be less conser-
vative about funding during the original
budgetary processes. He also noted that if
the money put into the fund is not enough
to reach the ceiling figure, money will not
be taken from other areas to build it up.
Money not allocated will continue to roll
into the next year's budget, as it always
has.
_ Borok maintained that it was important
for the board to make the decisions on
how to spend the extra money, because
“the board has been elected by the stu-
dents, and [board members] have a certain
amount of responsibility vested in them as
student representatives. We can’t go to the
students for a decision on every capital
expenditure.”
According to Terrence Milani, associate
director of student activities, he is “totally

behind Gil. Much of what he wanted to do
has always been in grasp. It just took-
someone with Gil’s effort to make the
improvements.”

Other reforms designed by Borok to
improve the efficiency of the allocations
process have also been approved by ad-
ministration officials. There will be written
justifications for budget denials so that the
groups will know as soon as they call why
they have been turned down. In addition,
there will be a new supplies requisition
sheet that.wi|l be easier to use.

Borok will also be outlining a proposal
for all competitive sports teams to be
funded by the Athletic Department, in-
stead of student government, as many of
the clubs are now funded.

by Pitt President Wesley Posvar.
The Chautauqua Conference will
bring 250 Soviet leaders and citi-

the largest and most eminent
public diplomacy effort between
the two superpowers.
' This conference, scheduled
for Oct. 29 to Nov. 3, is the first to
be held in a major American city.
The Soviet delegation will be
headed by Valentina Tereshkova,
the first female cosmonaut, and
will include Soviet writers, com-
posers, foreign ministers and
other citizens. Sen. John‘ Heinz,
R-Pa., has been named confer-
ence chairman.

“These are historic, fast-mov-

ing times in the Soviet Union,”-

Posvar said at Monday’s press
conference. “The future of per-
estroika and its implications for
U.S. trade and economic policy
are far from clear. This "fall’s
conference affords us a most
timely and extraordinary oppor-

Soldiers and Sailors’ lawn site of new garage

By 8. Jerome Lehmann
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh‘

has received approval from Al-
legheny County to begin con-
struction of a $17 million subter-
ranean parking garage under the

‘front lawn -of the Soldiers and

Sailors Memorial Hall. _
The National Development
Group of Oakland has been
contracted to build the four-story,
950—space garage, and construc-
tion is set to begin in September.
Pitt’s Assistant Director of Public
Safety Walter Waters said that the
garage, which has been in plan-
ning for a year, is expected to
ease the mammoth parking prob-
lem in Oakland. The facility will
be used by faculty and staff for
the normal fee of $48 a month.
Waters added that “night stu-
dents will definitely be allowed
to park in the garage, but the
decision as to whether daytime
s'udents will be allowed spaces

has not been decided.”
University officials decided to
build the more costly under-
ground garage instead of one
above ground because they feel
an obligation to the community
to maintain an aesthetic environ-
ment. After completion of the
construction, the front lawn of
the memorial will be returned to

its original landscape, with the
addition of new walkways, a
sprinkler system, and a handicap
entrance. '

“The one thing Oakland does
not need is another austere con-
crete building. The underground
garage will provide needed park-
ing while keeping the area visu-
ally pleasing,” Waters remarked.

The university has agreed to a
45-year lease on the underground
property and will pay the county
$2,083 per month during con-
struction, which is scheduled to

last approximately 18 months.

After completion of the garage,
Pitt will pay the county $250,000
annually for the first five years of
the lease. For thejfollowing 10

 

-and-—i

years the university will be obli-
gated to pay a sum which will be
compounded by $5,000 each yea r.
The university will then pay
$300,000 annually from the 16th
to 45th years, plus a fee deter-
mined by the current consumer
price index.

At the end of the 45- year lease
Pitt will have paid the county a

total of $12,775,000 in payments.

Waters said that the high cost
of the project might “possibly
force- the university to raise the
parking permit fees on all lots to
help subsidize the garage."

The terms of the lease prohibit
Pitt from.using the garage as a
public lot for revenue. At the end
of the 4§___,ye.ars the university has
the opti3'r'f*to“téxtend the lease or
the garage will be turned over to
the county.

.The county, which has been

losing money on the ‘memorial,
wanted Pitt to pay enough yearly
rent on the property to at mini-
mum cover the memorial’s an-
nual operating costs. »

The 16—person staff of the S01-
diers and Sailors Memorial Hall
will not be adversely affected by
the garage. The staff has an
adequate parking lot next to the
building. However, patrons of
the memorial will not be allowed
to use the garage and will have to
find parking elsewhere.

BEIJING (AP) — One million
people in Beijing and tens of
thousands in other cities marched
Tuesday to demand that Premier
Li Peng resign. There were signs
Li might be losing a power
struggle with more liberal fac-
tions of the leadership.

In the first official illumination
on the backstage struggle since
Saturday, when Li declared mar-
tial law in parts of the capital,
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said
Communist Party General Secre-
tary Zhao Ziyang remained in
office.

Zhao, who heads a more lib-
eral faction, favors meeting with
the students who have occupied
Tiananmen Square since May 15

to demand a dialogue on demo-
cratic reforms. He reportedly
offered to resign shortly before Li
ordered troops in to quell the
protest.

Qian’s comment to European
Community ambassadors, re-
ported by diplomatic sources, was
the first official word on Zhao’s
status.

under orders not to be deterred
by roadblocks or the Panama-

added.

Two convoys have been run so

one official, who insisted on
anonymity. The first two involved
a run‘ from the Atlantic coast of
Panama to the Pacific Ocean and
a run moving in the opposite

Kinko's is sued by publishers over alleged copyright infringements

Byllirik Kridle

Asst. News Editor



at

Q)

in

Eight publishers have recently ﬁled a
lawsuit in New York charging 12 _counts of
copyright violation against Kinko’s G raphic
Corporation.

Ifthe court rules in favor of the publish-
ers, “the real losers will be the students,”
said Andrianna Foss, Kinko’s corporate
communications director. “The lawsuit
tries to reinterpret the Fair Use clause of
the copyright laws, which allows faculty
members to make multiple copies of copy-
right materials for classroom use,” she
said.

Kinko’s vice president Kurt Koeni g said,
“Professors across the country depend on

Kinko’s to help them provide up—to-the-
minute course materials, and clearly the
ability to use timely materials is vital to the
quality of education that students receive.”

Both Koenig and Ross said that the
outcome of the lawsuit could have consid-
erable effects on professors’ rights to cre-
ate anthology text books for use in future
classes.

The lawsuit against Kinko’s centers
around several anthologies made by

Kinko’s at the request of one New York ,

University and three Columbia University
professors. According to the challenging
publishers, which include Harper & Row,
Penguin Books and McGraw-Hill, Kinko’s
failed to request copyright permission
from the publishers before copying.

The publishers claim that the materials
found in the anthologies did not fall under
the jurisdiction of the Fair Use clause, and
therefore Kinko’s should have contacted
the publishers for permission to copy their
copyrighted materials, which Kinko’s did
not do.

Kinko’s denies the charges of copyright
infringement, claiming protection under
the Fair Use clause (section 107) of the
federal copyright laws.

Foss said that Kinko’s Graphic retains a
staff of 10 full-time “co—workers” at its
national copyright center that contacts
publishers to obtain permission to copy
their materials when those materials do
not clearly fall under the jurisdiction of the
Fair Use clause. R

“What we consider to be a gray area and
what the publishers consider to be a gray
area are entirely different,” Foss said.

The publishers, however, say the Fair
Use clause is clear-cut in its intentions and
is not easily misinterpreted.

Virginia Antes, assistant director of
copyright for the Association of American

Publishers, said, “The eight publishers are ’

suing because Kinko’s broke the law,
plain and simple." According to Antos,
there is no question on the publishers’ part
that their lawsuit is legitimate.

However, Kinko's is firm in its de-

fense. “Wc ﬁrmly believe that Kinko’s is _

a friend to the publishing industry and that
we share the same basic interests,” Koenig

Pitt grads honored as Distinguished
Alumni of the School of Engineering

Two graduates of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh were
honored as Distinguished
Alumni of the School of Engi-
neering at a dinner for the
university's Engineering Alumni
Association.

Joseph F. Lagnese, Jr., a na-
tionally known environmental
engineering consultant to in-
dustry and government, and
Selwyn D. Berson, group vice
president of United Technolo-
gies Corp.’s largest business
entity, Pratt & Whitney received
the awards at the dinner held
last week.

Lagnese graduated from Pitt’s
School of Engineering in 1951
with a bachelor’s degree in civil
engineering. He went on to
obtain his master’s degree in
sanitary engineering. In addi-
tion to consulting, he provides
forensic engineering services
in the area of water pollution
control. He has lectured on
environmental engineering at
Pitt and on wastewater design
topics at both Carnegie Mellon
University and the University of
North Carolina.

Berson graduated from Pitt’s
School of Engineering in 1949

with a bachelor’s degree in
mechanical engineering. He
received his master's in me-
chanical engineering at Pitt in
1954, and in 1987 was named
to the Board of Visitors of the
School of Engineering. In his
current position at Pratt 8:
Whitney, he has senior respon-
sibilities for all aspects of the

Some suggestions for the

3” use of the reserve fund

Qt

»William Pitt Union,.used exclusively as an information E

Qt)

The student reserve fund is in the spotlight once again
as new plans are being formulated concerninghow it
should be spent... The latest suggestion from Gil Borok,
Student Government Board allocations chairman, is that
$50,000 of the $72,323 should be saved as a safety net in
case of budget overruns. This leaves $22,323 which can
be spent on some project or funneled back into the
allocations budget. I T

It is imperative that the money be used to benefit the
students who have contributed to it. ‘While it is an
attractive option to let the money build up for a few years
so that something more impressive can be done with it,
this is a problematic solution. If the fund sits inactive for
more that a year, over 6,000 graduating students will not
§ee tliebenefits of their money. ..   .. .. ., .

We would like to suggest two possible uses for this
money. The first is the construction of a computerized

-kiosk, like those in Forbes Quadrangle and Thackeray

Hall. A computerized kiosk is an information terminal
using a video display to give information about registra-
tion procedures, campus technical services, etc. We
suggest that one be installed in the Towers lobby, with
dorm information, cafeteria hours and menus, and the
locations of campus buildings. This is a heavily traveled
area; the usefulness of such a device is readily apparent,

A second suggestion we have is for the construction and
staffing of an information booth to be established in the

retrieval and dissemination center for student organiza-
tions. By acting as a year-round activities booth, it would
not only help keep interest in extracurricular activities at
a higher level, it would also allow freshmen an easy way
to find out about these groups after they have become
acclimated to the university and the city. The first months
of freshman year is a hectic time, and by the time things
slow down enough for students to even think about
joining a group, most of the information is no longer
available. The information booth would keep any litera-

- ture the groups might have. It would have information on_
the locations and representatives for each group.’ Special ‘

events could be advertised there. After building such a
booth, there would still be more than enough money left

- over to pay for students to ‘manthe booth. This idea

combines the attractiveness of an immediate dividend for
the students who have paid into the fund and the
usefulness of doing something that will make a lasting
contribution to the student body. A i

There are many possibilities, and we ask only that the
SGB keep two things in mind. Spend the money on
something functional and useful (no more neon sculp-
tures), and spend our money before we graduate. We
want to see what is being done with it.

The solution to the Panamanian crisis

Should the United States go to

war against Panamanian Gen.‘

Manuel Noriega?

Should we send in the Army,
the Navy, the Air -Force, the
Marines’ — hell, the National
Guard and the Coast Guard, too?
Would it be a good idea to wipe
that drug-dealing scum—of-a-dic-
tator off the face of the earth?

 

Absolutely. Gently caressing
your ‘pet ~ éloive ,1 you  focus your
downcast eyes upon me. A woeful
expression darkens the features
of your somber face and you say,
“I don’t want a war against Nori-
ega. American men and women
die in war. The thought of
American blood being spilled in
Panama sickens me.”

Hey, it sickens me, too. But
gimme a break. I’m not advocat-
ing the death of our fellow coun-
trymen. Hardly. What I am sug-
gesting is this: Let’s give Noriega
and his henchmen the chance to
commit suicide.

Panama is a country of roughly
1.4 million citizens. As already
evidenced in P'anama’s recent
election, the majority of Panama-
nians are opposed to the Noriega
regime. *

played havoc on my bladder, and

power and ﬁrepower of the armed
forces of the United States of

result would be the greatest
mismatch since the war in Gre-

rectly, it would end just as quickly.
Before you could shout, “Viva

A Freedom!” the people of Panama

would be living in a democracy.

Forcibly overthrow the cu rrent
Panamanian government? Just
the thought of it causes your
liberal jaw to drop down to your
chest, and with your eyes wide

if I’ve completely lost my mind.

Well, what would you su ggest?
A diplomatic solution?

In ‘case you haven't been keep-

It “all” started with the Descen-
dents’ punky—pop style of hilari-
ous rock ‘n’ roll. Milo was the
band’s symbolic leader, roaming
through life’s adventures, which
took him straight from birth right
up to graduate school as a nerdy,
suburban punk.

Punk rock was the big thing
then, and though the Descen-
dents played the music, there
was always a tone of sarcasm in
every song, poking fun at the
parts ofthe “punk scene” that the
band members disagreed with.
Name just about any subject, and
the Descendents sang about it:
drugs, music, sex, parents, flatu-
lence, smelly feet and a host of
other very human subjects

Eventually, after a total of nine
Descendents releases, Milo (then
the lead vocalist) headed off to
graduate school, and the band
was left with a big decision: ei-
ther wait for his return, as they
did with the Milo Goes to (,'(>ll(eg(a
LP, or find a new singer and go
on.

Fortune struck quickly in the
form of Dave Smalley, a former
Dag Nasty member, so the band
reformed under the name. All,
with the intentions ofcarrying on
the Descendents’ saga. A spritely
character by the name of Allroy
took over as the band’s cartoon

Cl‘C3[Ul'C.

/tllroySez was the group’s first
LP, followed by a single (lust
Pevfec/) and two EPs (Allroy for
Prezand S‘/.7e’s My Ex). While the
rough Descendents sound re-
m:tin(_-.(l, Smalley brought with
him just a touch of seriousness
that was still hidden behind the
band’s humorous attitude.

The institutions ofhigher learn-
ing pre.ye.d on All as well, claim-
ing Smalley, who went to Pasad-
ena to pursue a graduate degree
in political science

Smalley was replaced by new-
comer Scott Reynolds who is
featured on the band’s most re-
cent Ll’ release, Allr0y’s Revenge.

All has broken out of the
Descendents’ mold for the most
part, developing a distinctively
different style over the years.
Most ofthe brash punk inﬂuence
has been set aside for a more
homey rock ‘n’ roll sound.

The lyrics have taken on an
even more realistic tone than
before, but not at the expense of
/\ll‘slove forfun.Songslike“Bub—
blegum,” and “No Traffic,” may
not sound very serious on the
Slll‘l:'l(’(t, but deep down there are
sorne lit‘-:ti‘tft‘~.lt messages being
(‘0ll\’(T\'(‘(l.

Love seems to be a favorite
subject, as witnessed by songs

like “She’s My Ex," and “Mary,”
but then again, these guys have
always been fascinated by fe-
males.

All, as well as the Descendents,
have constantly placed a great
deal of emphasis on their live
performances. The energy they
receive from the fans boosts their
performance, and their interac-
tion with the audience is a very
important part of the music.

All set out on the Allroy’s Re-
venge tour back on April 20, with
45 prospective cities set on their
agenda. Tonight they stop in
Pittsburgh where they will be
playing with Half Life and
Slugworth at the Electric Banana.

Unpretentious, catchy, super-
pop rock. That's Sweet Baby.

This Bay area foursome’s
debut album, It’sA Girl, is noth-
ing short of fun, raucous and
rock ‘n’ roll. The songs are short,
the melodies are quick, and the
lyrics are simple.

All of the songs are about girls
(hence the title It’s A Girl) and
Sweet Baby covers all bases of
teenage puppy—love, crushes and

heartbre.aks.

Comparisons to the Ramones
and even early Beatles are cer-
lainly valid, but there's some-
thing more to Sweet Baby. They
add a refreshingly innocentqual-
ity to the music. Nothing on It’sA
Girlis incredibly unique, but their
fresh approach to the tried and
true staple of pop/punk rock is
readily accessible.

Vocalist Dallas Denery and
guitarist =\1att Buenrostro started
working on songs together dur-
ing their high school years, but it

wasn't until they reached college
and teamed up with Richard
Bu cher (bass) and Sergie Loobkoff
(drums) that Sweet Baby was
born.

Now, two years after their
formation and release of their
album, the band's lineup has
changed. Stepping in for the
departed rhythm section are Ivy
Dubois (bass) and Aaron Elliot
(drums).

The rain that fell on the St.
Clair Country Club golf course
yesterday didn’t seem to bother
D.A. Weibring as he shot an
amazing 10 under par to win
the two-round Sixth Annual
Family House Invitational.

Weibring, who shot a 67 in
both rounds, pulled ahead of
veteran Lee Trevino latein the
second round, stayed ahead of
a solid performance by Mike
Hulbert and held off a good
comeback by Tom Kite for his
victory.

“It’s great to play well and to
have this feeling,” said Weibring.
“Obviously it’s nice to win the
money, but what feels good to
me is to play well. I haven’t
played as well this year as I
would like. I’ve played OK up
to the green, but I haven’t been
putting real well.”

Weibring admitted his troub-
led putting continued up to the
first nine holes of the second
round. After that, he seemed to
forget all of his troubles. His
score on the second nine holes

Paul Azingcr and Hulbert were

Weibring and Trevino to play

always draws a big ‘crowd, or

inspiration to Weibring.

When the NCAA holds its
annual Outdoor Track Champi-
onships in Provo, Utah next week,
it will be a special meet for a
variety of reasons.

First, it is a national champion-
ship. The people who will be
competing have dedicated a good
part of their lives to track. As a
result of this dedication, they are
competing with the best this
country has to offer. A c -
cording to Pitt women’s track
coach Steve Lewis, dedication is
only one of the qualit'i'esCf,ll‘i'at a
person needs to even attempt to
compete on the national level.

“First of all, you need talent.
Then you need self-motivation,
desire, and then dedication,” said
Lewis.

One individual on the women’s
track team who possesses these
qualities is Keisha Demas. Demas
will be competing in the 400-
meter dash in Utah. She qualified
by running a 53.08, which was
well under the 53.14 qualifying
time.

The fact that one needs to
qualify also makes the national
championships special. By set-

 

Pitt ’s Demas strives
for NCAA track title

ting tough qualifying standards,
the NCAA tries to put together a
meet in which the top 18 athletes
in each event are competing.
Lewis said that in addition to
her other qualities, Demas is team-
oriented. This is evidenced by
the fact that Pitt has an opportu-

nity to qualifya teaminthe 4x400
relay event, of which Demas
would be an integral part. As for
the national championships,
Lewis feels that Demas has a
chance ofbeing an All—American.

Demas feels the competition in
Utah “will be tough, but I'll trymy
best."

She also hopes to be on the
Olympic team in 1992. She was
invited to the Trinidad Olympic
trials, for the 1988 Olympics. At
the beginning of this season she
was not 100 percent sure that she
could qualify; however, she now
feels that, “qualifying was a real
boost to my confidence. I just
need to do my best every time I
step on the track.”

Panthers absent from, Big East list

Providence, RI — Villa-
nova’s Gary Scott was named
Big East Player of the Year
while teammate Gene Schall
was voted Big East Freshman
of the Year. Seton Hal1’s ace
Kevin Morton took Big East

a .570 on-base percentage.

For the second consecutive ‘

year, Scott was named the all-

Morton broke two Big East
pitching marks this season
with six wins and a .92 earned
run average. He did not lose
a conference game (6-0).and
led all hurlers with 51 strike-
outs, holding a 0.00 ERA
through four Big East starts.

The University of Pittsburgh's
men’s and women’s track teams
will be hosting a track meet this
Friday at Pitt Stadium, starting at
4 p_.m. This meet’s primary pur-
pose is to give many talented
athletes another chance to qual-
ify for the NCAA track meet which
takes place in June.

Not only are several Pitt ath-
letes still trying to qualify for this
meet, but many other athletes
from a variety of schools are as

Well.

Pitt men’s coach, John Vasvary,
said, “This won’t be a big meet in
terms of numbers, but there will
be tremendous quality in some
events. The women’s 400-, 800-,
4x/I00-meter, and mile relays will
all have good competition. The
men’s 110 hurdles, 400, 800, 400
hurdles, and mile relay, will all be
outstandingly competitive races.”

For example, the men’s 110
high hurdles features Quaddray
Pisher, who was the No.1 hurdler
in the cou ntry last year. Also
competing in the 110 hurdles will

For The Pitt News

Several members of Pitt’s men’s
track team competed last week-
end at the lC4A track meet. The
IC4A meet features all of the best
track performers in the Eastern
United States.

Vasvary, the results were both
“good and bad."

In the 110-meter hurdles, Eric
Cannon took first place by run-
ning the second fastest time ever
in the meet’s history. It was also
the fastest collegiate time in the
country.

Vasvary said, “He really estab-
lished himself.”

Also in the 110 hurdles, Elbert
Ellis tripped over the last hurdle,
but still managed to take second
place in the event, and qualify for
the NCAAs.

In the 4x400 relay, the team of

Neil Malobicky, James Stephens, '

Chappale “Chop” Burton and
Dave Price took fifth place. Dave
Moore took sixth in the 800.
