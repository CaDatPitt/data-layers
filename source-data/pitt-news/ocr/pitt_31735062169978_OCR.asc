U.C. Recommends
Curriculum Revisions

By PAT BORKOWSKI
Staff News Writer

The Undergraduate Council proposed curriculum revisions

in the areas of distribution of studies, the language requirement

and the pass fail system at the Faculty Senate meeting today.
The proposals are to be voted on my a mail ballot before Wed-

nesday.

Concerning distribution of studies, th e Undergraduate
Council has recommended that the requirement be revised so a
student must earn nine credits, rather than 14 or 15, in each of
the three areas of learning (humanities, social sciences and
natural sciences) with credits taken from a minimum of three

departments,

Students will not be limited to specific courses, but may
elect any courses for which they have met the stated departmental
prerequisite. An interdisciplinary course may still be substituted for

a departmental course in meeting
the requirement.

The council has also recom-
mended a major change in both
the grading and philosophy of the
pass fail option. The grading sys-
tem will be changed from P F to
S U with “S” denoting satisfac-
tory (A, B or C) achievement
and .“U” indicating unsatisfac-
tory (D or F) achievement.

“S” grades will count as credit

toward graduation, but will not be i

used in computing a student's
QPA. “U” grades will carrylnei-
ther credit nor quality points.‘

Under this proposal, a student
may elect one S U course of his
own choice each term ‘(maximum

,of eight). although the student

may not elect any S U course in
his major or related area without
the approval of the major depart-
ment.

Concerning the language re-
quirement, the Council has rec-
ommended that students engaged
in language 1, 2, 3, and 4 courses
may either take such courses for
quality grades (A, B, C, D or F)

or elect the S U grading system ’

  Dean Pease Passes Judicial Board

By JIM MARGITANI
Staff News Writer

After several meetings with
members _of the Men’s Dormi-
tory Council‘ and the Direc-
tor of Housing David Ginevin,

Dean N. Ronald Pease has

passed the Judicial Board
for the Men’s Residence Halls.
Under this Board, male residents
accused of violating dorm rules
will be tried by their fellow stu-
dents.

The Board is composed of sev-
en justices, a non-voting secre-
tary and a non-voting advisor.
Four justices are selected in the
winter term and the other three
are selected in the fall. They may
serve for only the two terms, fall
and winter, and must reapply for
the position if they so wish.

, Among the responsibilities of
i the Board are:

—-to state what actions consti-
tute a violation of dorm rules
and to make public the penal-
ties that can be imposed

—to give ample notification of
the charges to the student and
aid him in obtaining witnesses
in his behalf

—to refrain from punishing -an
entire group of students for the
actions of one

Decisions of guilt and dismissal
require a two—thirds majority of

45*‘ the justices. All other questions

   

A. ll. -

require only a simple majority.
Furthermore. recommendations

the University must be approved
by the Dean of Students. If con-
victed, the student may appeal his"
case, but must do so within two
days of the decision.

The Bylaws also list the rights
ofstudents, among which are:

The three-day teach-in came to
an end at noon Friday as repre-
sentatives of the Concerned ‘Stu-
dents and Faculty met with the
public media for a press confer-

. ence.

A group of approximately 15
tasters. waited until after the con-
ference to indulge themselves in
their first meal since that pre-
vious Tuesday at noon.

Lenny Orr presents one of pub-
lic statements.

Prof. Hays’

Statement

(Editor‘s Note: The following

v statement was issued by Samuel

Hays, chairman of the History De-

f partment, at the conclusion of the

three-day tree university.)
The student teach-in at the Uni-

.‘ versity is now coming to a close.
Much

information about the
events of these three days has
been reported in the media. Some.
of these reports have been accu-
rate; others have not. It seems ap-
propriate, therefore. now to set
the record straight.

It is especially important to
stress that in no way did the

_ teach-in disrupt or interfere with

the life of the University. Even
when the students occupied the
Common Facilities building the

issue was not one of disruption. '

actual or potential. The students
‘there as well as in the Social Sci-
ence building scrupulously took

. pains to see that no interference

with the normal life of the Uni-
versity would take place. They
readily agreed to use only those
rooms which faculty representa-
tives designated for use and took

C V the initiative to make sure‘ that

such use would be appropriate.
They agreed not to use any facil-
ities in such a way as to interfere
with activities in the building,
‘and as _a regular occupant of the
building I have seen nothing
which would indicate that this
agreement was not carried out
precisely.

It seems important to stress that
_the way in which the teach-in
was conducted was an example

. of open, vigorous, peaceful and

effective debate which is healthy
for the University. Whether we
agree with the special substantive
ideas of students is not the ques-
tion. Many of us do not. But we
do seek to construct a climate of
open and free discussion of the
issues which students, as well as
faculty, raise. The manner- in
which the students carried on this
teach-in, therefore. should be
;commended as a demonstration of
peaceful, non-violent, and con-
structive involvement of students
in the life of the University.

Free University

Joshua Chasen, graduate teach-

ing fellow in history, explained.

to the press that the group of
about 150 were presently gather-
ed there at the Social Science
Building to “bring together
ideas" and through the press. to
“present a message to the Pitts-
burgh community.”

Lenny Orr, teaching fellow in
philosophy, explained that the
participants of the free universi-
ty “learned a lot of things that
will help us” and have realized
“how we have to explain what
we’re about to the Pittsburgh
community.” Orr stated that
“we’ve created our own univer-
sity. We created our own com-
munity of what we think a uni-
versity is. We don't want’ the
message to be lost on the Pitts-
burgh community.”

In the Concerned Students and‘

Faculty statement (see Pitt News,
Friday, March 14). Dr. David
Houston, professor of economics.
also commented on the impor-

tance of the “relationship be-,

tween the University and the com-
munity.,". The group's proposals
included. among others, the equal
availability of all University phy-
sical education facilities to the
immdiate community, Univer-
sity aid for those displaced by
expansion. and at categorized list
published of all University de-
fense contracts.

Dr. David Houston reads the
Concerned Students and Facul-
ty Statement lorthe press.

In answering the charges of
violence during the three days.
John Seidman. graduate student.
presented a petition signed by 81
faculty members testifying that
the teach-in had been “scrupu-
lously non-violent.” Some signa-

tures, according to Seidman.,

came from the most “conserva-
tive" members of the faculty.

Houston was asked by the press
if the proposals in the statement
were demands or requests, to
which he replied that “rhetoric
is not what’s important; the pro-
posals are. We would expect the
administration to be responsive.
If not, we'll face the problem
when is comes. We don’t want to
threaten the administration.

Chasen reaffirmed this point of
view. “We want to get away from
threatening. We did this non-vio-
lently. We bent over backwards
several times. We're trying to cre-
ate a non-violent context. and
were being very reasonable and
tolerant. If the administration re-
jects our proposals. they will be
denying the spirit of the Univer-
sity that we've» been trying to cre-
ate."

John Wills. graduate teaching

fellow. elaborated that the open‘

university is a “course without
structure. open 24 hours. for con-
tinuing discussion and research
of the university itself." Orr em-
phasized that the “open universi-
ty is for everyone.” He said that
he was aware of the problem of
the lack of communication among
students. and for that reason, the
Concerned Students and Faculty
had proposed a forum with engi-
neering students to discuss their
place in society.

(A petition had been circulated

neering students asking to support
the administration's stand on the
open university. A speaker from
the audience, an engineer, stated
that 300 of the 1,500 in the sem-
inar had signed.)

Asked what the teach-in had
accomplished, Chasen stated that
“we’re beginning to talk. We’ve
showed the faculty, the adminis-
tration, Harrisburg. and each
other that we’re reasonable."

Free Thinking

‘The fast is over, and the proposals are drawn-up. After

_ three days, three nights, and three buildings, the Free Univer-

sity is history. But if everyone experienced a fraction of the men-

, ‘ tal exercise that those who had to make decisions did, then it
V . -_ was a huge success.

To my mind, a Free or Open University encourages think-

 ing. Real, hard thinking. Not memorizing. Not regurgitating or
" mouthing the thoughts of a few. but free, open, tedious think’-
? . ing. Thinking before, during, and after decisions are made.

' This is exactly what the administration had to do last week.
This is what the leaders of the Free University had to do. This

' ‘ is what those who discussed, argued, or merely listened to the
' various options for action of the Free University had to do.

But the -sad thing is that three very important groups more
than likely failed to experience this thinking process.

One of these groups is the majority of students and faculty.
This is not toV say that they should agree or disagree with the

? Free University and its ideas. It is to say only that they should

learn them and think about them. Another group is the com-

I ‘ munity. The taxpayer, the newspaper-reader, the television-

watcher. They. too, should think about what was being said.

I "V I even though it happened to be a minority group saying it.

The third group is the State Legislature. They should
think about a movement to “build,” and not write it off as a
movement to “tear down." Thinking about what the Free Uni-
versity means and how those who advocate it acted during the
three days it lasted could cause a change of heart toward the
Fleming bill and similar legislation.

The free University had quite a bit to say about thesitua-

' tion here. If you draw an analogy between the present situation
V here and the present situation all across the country, the Free

University had a lot to say about society. government, educa-
, tion and numerous other elements of our lives.

Whether or not one agrees with what was said. it would

do everyone some good to investiage the ideas presented. Think
about it! ' ' Vi

gentry allowed another winner to
slip away when Jim O‘Brien—one

-sssssss. I   ass: Over The Edge 
I Can’t Feel Anger;
 Feel Truly Sorry

. by DAVE ROSENBLUM
The tragedy of Wesley Posvar drew closer to its inevitable
« finale last Tuesday night.

In an action that can only be described as heinous, the
Chancellor of this University called the Pittsburgh Police and
gave them permission to remove the students who were peace-

fully conducting their “Free University” inside the Common

   

 

 

Jim O*Brien — a Pitt graduate — I

Facilities Building.

When the students told Posvar that they would not leave
the building they had chosen to hold classes in, the Chancellor

obtained a?
court injunc-
t i o n t h a t
would have
been backed
by police force
had the stu-
dents not left.
But in order to
get the injunc-
tion, Wesley
Posvar had to   
conjure up the ROSENBLUM
most flagrant set of lies that I
have ever had thevmisfortune to
read. .- -- ’ V

In the exact words of the in-
junction, Posvar claimed that stu-
dents “have unlawfully and con-
tinue to prevent the officers and
employees of the (University)

A from conducting normal univer-

sity business, that (students) have
interfered with the free ingress,
egress, and regress to the Com-
mon Facilities Building . . . That
students have unlawfully seized
and occupied the Common Facil-
ities Building. . . . The (Univer-
sity) will continue to suffer great
and irreparable damage. . . .”

As anyone attending the f‘Free
University" knows. there was no
blocking of exits or classrooms.
no seizure of the building. and no
threat of “great or irreparable
damage.“ The Chancellor lied
about the conditions inside the
building in order to obtain his in-
junction.

Ido'not feel anger towards Pos-_

var. because I cannot feel anger
towards quaking. frightened men.
I feel truly sorry for the Chan-
cellor who must resort to lies to
control his students. Some people
will claim that a great amount of
pressure was eminatihg from
Harrisburg. but I cannot accept
that as an excuse. '

When the students made it clear
that there would be no violence
and that no university function
would be interferred with, Posvar
should have -called a press con-

ference. His remarks could have

been:

“There has been violence on
many university campuses across
the nation. but today a group of
student have met to discuss
changes for this University in a
peaceful. responsible manner.
They have enough respect for the
responsiveness of the administra-
tion to feel that violence is un-
necessary to effect change. I
commend these students and will
make myself available to discuss
whatever they deem appropriate."

A statement such as this would
have shown that the Chancellor
could control his studentsgand
more importantly. that he respect-
ed them. But instead he called in
the police and proved to many

soon appear at Duquesne Univer-
sity‘ and Point Park College.
where Jim O‘Bri_en could do "a
most capablejob. ” .

Jim has wide range sports
knowledge. ‘He is progressive in
his thinking. likable. and out-.
standing in public relations work. _ -

students that his statements about
tr_ying to commuicate with the
younger generation‘ were just
other rabbits pulled from his hat
of lies.

Yet the real tragedy of Wesley
Posvar did not affect the admin-
istration, but rather the students
who still held some hope that ad-
ministrators would respond to rea-
sonable action. '

V The first night of the "Free
University" both the former pres-
ident of Student Government and
the current editor of this newspa-
per urged the students to leave
the building because they felt
that it would be in the best inter-
est of. the “student movement."
But the following night, after
realizing that responsible action
did not affect the Chancellor.
they both advocated remaining in
the building.

Such a change of heart is the.

true tragedy for this University --

and this country. Slowly. but very
surely. the young of America are
seeing that the people in power
do not fear only change through
violence, but change through any
means. They are seeing that the
power structure will react to non-
violent change with violent force.
Wesley Posvar‘s request for the
men in blue is a glaring example.

When the 700'.students who at-
tended the night of infamy reach
this level of awareness and sense
of futility, non-violence will cease
as a form of dissent. The only
form possible will be computer
center takeovers where students
will have to threaten to destroy
million dollar machinery in order

to make the administration re- ,

spond. -

The students of the “Free Uni-
versity” created a list of requests
for the administration, and as
surely as the night follows the
day. they will be half-answered
or sent to committees. After bow-
ing to the violent threats of the
administration too many times.
one can only lower his head and
hope no one will be hurt.

But if it comes to that, I want
every student to remember who
the orginal advocates of non-vio-
lence were. and I want every stu-
dent to remember who found it
necessary to react violently when
peaceful men gathered to better
this University.

But above everyone else I want
Wesley, Posvar. wherever he may
be next year. to remember who
set this despicable precedent of
violence at Pitt. I want him to
read the descriptions carefully
and watch the television intently.
Remember the Genesis. For then.
and only then. will the tragedy of
Wesley Posvar be complete.

together. pulling no punches and
reported to his listeners (WEEP
radio) and readers (Pittsburgh

Weekly Sports) in a way they en-'

joyed and understood.

In my opinion. Jim O'.Brien's
work is reminiscent of the report-
ing of the late Dan Parker. and

the other great spor'ts'analyst-

SG Reform
Necessary

b BILL ROSEN
SG Senator

After serving as a senator for
two months, I am convinced
that Student Government. in
its present structure. is ludri-
crous, has no legitimacy. and.
in some cases. is detrimental
to the welfare of the student
body.

Some of the
recent “impor-
t a n t ’ ’ bills

been: . cancel-

condemning or condoning the ac—g;"‘,.

tions of other students. Instead
of SG supporting the baseball
teams effort to raise money, SG
should go out and actually raise
money for the team.

As Senator Andy Swartz said at
the last SG meeting. “When are
we going to stop talking about
all this trivial B.S. and discuss
something important?“

Well, something important was
discussed; who will be the next
chairman of the Arts and Sciences
Cabinet.

A selection committee. compos-

ed of Scott Baum. president of SG.’

Ken Schueler. past president
of SG. and Joe Kociubes. out-
going chairman of the ACS. nom-

- inated Mike Fabricant for the

position. It islthe Senate’s job to
approve a new ASC chairman.

Kocibues spoke to the Senate
for 45 minutes‘ explaining the
duties and accomplishments of
the ASC over the past year.

Many of the Senators, prior to.

Kociubes's speech. were ignorant
of the acutlal function of the ASC.
The same Senators then had to
vote on the chairman of the cab-
inet! ‘

After questioning Fabricant on

his ideas, the Senate did not ap-»

prove his appointment. This
means the ASC will not have a
chairman for at least two weeks,
(when the Senate meets again.

The main point of this whole
issue is that. under the present
structure of SG. the chairman of
the ASC may not be selected for
months if the Senate can not ap-
prove of someone. Such action
would destroy and progress made
by ‘the Cabinet and actually kill
the entire purpose of the ASC.

The time for SG reform is now.
At the la_st meeting a bill was pas-
sed which will establish a com-
mittee to review the function and
structure of SG. Lets ‘hope the
committee can present a legiti-
mate structure for SG in_place
of the joke we have now.

‘Misunderstancling’ Set

  

lAright By Student

Editor. The Pitt News:

Miss Barbara Sargent. in her
March 10 letter to The Pitt News,
unabashedly displays to the Uni-
versity community either her
gross misunderstanding of the stu-
dent power issues or her lack of
intellectual honesty.

Apparently she is aware that
some students resent the present
grading system. have complaints
about the curriculum. and find
fault with certain course require-
ments. Such students indeed exist
and have recently vocalized and
articulated their criticisms. Their
views have been expressed at
numerous public meetings and
have repeatedly been published
on handbills and in this student
newspaper.

The only place where evidence
has appeared to support Miss Sar-
gent's claim that such students
also "do not want to attend lec-
tures.“ "balk at learning facts."
“resent writing (sic) examina-
tions." "dread having the qual-
ity of their work and thought . . .
evaluated." and "prefer their own
opinions and interpretations . . .
to those of scholars" is in Miss
Sargent‘s mind.

One may disregard the rest of
her letter on the grounds that the

' conclusion of an argument with

false premises is irrelevant.

intent was to dis-

There are students who object
to the present curriculum because
they believe that a university cur-
riculum should be related or re-
latable to contemporary social
problems outside the university.
that said curriculum should lead
to a more incisive understanding
of self and of one‘s personal en-
vironment and that courses should
stimulate and sharpen ones in-
tellectual talents.

It would be only fair to state
that this university's curriculum
in part already satisfies the above
criteria. However. the fact that a
student is required to normally
carry five courses and cannot pos-
sibly devote enough time to five
or even four courses in a trimes-
ter in order to make the material
personally meaningful. evaluate
the discipline critically. and re-
tain any substantial portion of 15
weeks lectures and reading goes
a long way towards negating the
advantage of quality curriculum.

As for required courses. it.

seems reasonable that students
should protest having to take
courses that neither have interest
in nor -expect to benefit from.
clearly because such courses re-
duce the already limited time one
has to pursue what one is inter-
ested in and regards as valuable.

If Miss Sargent believes in om-
niscient people who can deter-
mine the educational needs of
several thousand students. she
may also believe in all-knowing
government officials qualifie.d..to
decide the spiritual needs of
many thousands of citizens.

As Miss S_argent stated. there"

are people in universities who do
not belong there. Such peopleare

characterized by their propensity -

to distort the opinions of others
when a vested interest in threat-
ened. and by their demonstrated
inability to View the situatio.n-b_e-
fore them both lucidly and hon-.
estly. ‘ ‘  '

Editor. The Pitt News;

While reading Friday's Pitt
News, it came as a ‘surprise to
us that some “foreign students"
feel that their opinions are rep-
the foreign
students at Pitt. The foreign stu-
dents of this University come
from many countries and cultur-
al backgrounds. and it can not be
assumed that all of us react in
the same manner to our experien-
ces in this country.

_ For instance. we. as foreign
students. are not opposed to be-

ing asked about our-countries. It
is true that some people may ask
seemingly foolish or embarrass-
ing questions. but we feel that
there is no better source than the
foreign student himself to clarify
these misconceptions. In fact.
we are pleased and proud to tell
Americans about our countries.
We also feel that for those Ameri-
can students who are really inter-
ested in other countries and cul-
tures. it is more appealing and re-
warding to talk to a foreign stu-
dent instead of going to a book.

Rock and Revolution

Synthesis of Movements

by JOE ANDERSON
Staff Feature Writer

Rock and revolution seem like

.the_y should always work well to-

gether. Both are such explosive
and dynamic phenomena that one
wonders if a combination of the
two would not result in a move-
ment of cataclysmic proportions.
Both are electric. elastic and spon-
taneous.

Yet no one has successfully
joined the two life styles. The
folk-protest movement united a
staid and sedentary musical form
with political dynamism and the
resultant incongruity was ineffec-
tual and ultimately frustrating.
The Fugs tie rock in with politics
(among other things» but due

_ solely to their lack of seriousness

and school-boy theatrics. no one
takes them to heart.

To date. the most successful
synthesis of rock and the politics
of revolution has come from the
work of the Rolling Stones and
Beggar’s Banquet. But sadly
enough the only media open to
the Stones of late has been the
FM rock stations and the record
pla_yer. Without their direct and
constant participation in the

movement through live perform-
ances and planned guerrilla con-
certs. the Stones‘ music loses most
of its exigency.

Since the Chicago massacre
there has been a increasing de-
mand for sort of commitment by
the rock cult to the growing re‘-
sistence. The MC5 have rather in-
eptly attempted to meet this de-
mand. Their albums on Elektra,
Kick Out the Jams (EKS-74042)
is a chaotic compendium of the
new rock revolution. The trouble
with the MC5 is that most of their

' appeal comes from senseless po-

litical invectives.

Their music depends too much
on noise and sheer high decibles
which quickly turns off the audi-
ence. The vocal is bad and un-
intelligible. If the MC5 is saying
something it‘s impossible to make
out what. Nobody is going to take
hislelothes off and run into the
street if he knows not the reason
for doing so. The MC5 does have
great potential which could easi-
ly be actualized if they would
only pay greater attention to their
presentation.

Steppenwolf has an almost fan-
tastic new album entitled At Your

THE ONLY showing in Pittsburgh of the most recent film by the Bea-
tles, Magical‘ Mystery Tour, will be held Friday in Carnegie Music Hall.
Shows are scheduled at 7 p.m., 9 p.m. and '11 p.m. with a $2 admisstion

charge.

Magical Mystery Tour, in color, was intended as a TV super-spec-
tacular. The Beatles wrote, produced, directed, filmed, edited, and star-
red. in the film. While it was shown on British TV, the American net-
works were unwilling to meet the price asked by the Beatles, and conse-
quently it was not shown in”this country. Recently, Nemporer Artists,
Ltd., a company controlled by the Beatles, has released the film in a few
university communities, but it will not be shown in theatres anywhere.

Also on the program is Ingrid, a short distributed by the Beatles’
Apple Corps., Ltd., and two underground shorts, Scott Bartletts’ Off-On,

and Will Hindle’s Fetch.

Birthday Party IDSX-50053l. If
_you can get by the corny album
title and the even cornier jacket
design. then you'll find the rec-
ord well worth the bother. The
material is for the most part typ-
ical hard blues with a few digres-
sions. sometimes successful and
sometimes not. The best of the
cuts are “Chicken Wolf." “lupi-
ter Child" and “Rock Me"—hard,
raunch rock which makes the
Steppenwolf so appetizing.

There is even a tongue- in-cheek
country and western piece,
“Round and Down.” The lead vo-

.cal, John Kay, wtih his harsh grav-
_el voice, is a very convincing

blues singer when he takes the
time to get into it.

If you take the new double al-
bum by the Rascals. Freedom
Suite (SD 2-901). and just forget
sides three and four you wont

-be disappointed. The Rascals

seemed to have a fecund talent
for taking simple. almost naive
ideals and making memorable
songs out of them le.g. “People
Got To Be Free“ I. Where the al-
bum really falls apart is when the
Rascals. get into the instrumen-
tals (the entire second disc i. There
is a 13 minute-drum slowly.
“Boom." which even Ginger Bak-

‘er couldn‘t pull off much the less

Dino Danelli.

It‘s just all so much wasted
space. But when the Rascals get
into their concept music. they
more than make up for the obnox-
ious instrumentals. The Rascals
have always been into white soul
music and by now they are the
undisputed masters. So much of
the music on Freedom Suite
sounds like an old time gospel
meeting. The choral arrange-
ments fit real well into the Free-
dom Suite concept of the album
and are goodexamples of restraint
and calculation devastation. It
seems that at a moment‘s notice
the Rascals can propel an audi-
ence to the brink of emotional
oblivion.

The latest album by the Gary
Burton Quartet (which has un-
dergone a few personnel changes»
is one of the better jazz albums
to come out so far this year. Coun-_
try Roads and Other Places (LSP-
4098) is well worth both the mon-
ey and the trouble to get into.

Kuhn Manages Fourth;
Payne Misses Tourney

by ROY JACOBS

PRINCETON, N. J. — Penn State’s Clyde Frantz modestly
accepted the Outstanding Wrestler Award for the 65th annual
Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Tournament.
then posed for photographers and the television camera. While
flashbulbs popped, varsity wrestling coach Dave Adams stood
across the floor and quietly observed.

Someone standing next to Adams turned to him and said. “Just 3

think. that could have been Mark Payne."

Sadly. Adams nodded assent.

The previous day, a beaten
Bruce Unangst had forced a half-
grin and admitted that he had been
“a little too sick, a little too
bad. You name it.” He could
have been speaking for the entire
varsity squad that weekend.

Only heavyweight Ralph Cind-
rich and 160-pounder Bob Kuhn
realized anylof the bright hopes
Adams had for his squad in the
tourney. Cindrich completed
an undefeated season by cop-

 

ping the unlimited class cham-

pionship in his first try. Kuhn‘

placed fourth in his class.

Beyond those two. the squad
fell flat. Only two other grap-
plers even won one bout. But the
cruelest mishap of all struck be-
fore the tourney even began Fri-
day afternoon.

At 3:30 a.m. Friday morning,
Mark Payne, second seed in the
‘I37-pound weight class and one
of the varsity’s best chances at a

title. suffered a kidneystone at- “

    

  

tack (Pittdom?). After some pre-
liminary treatment by assistant
coach Bob Fehrs, Payne was
rushed to the hospital.

-There, he was plied with fluids

in an attempt to reduce the size of‘

the stones and perhaps flush the
stones out. The pain was reduced.
but Payne’s weight went up to a

pound and a half over the limit

‘for the 137-pound class; so he
couldn’t have wrestled even if he
had felt up to par.

“I think losing Mark sort of
emotionally drained some of the
guys — all of us, in fact,” figured

Adams. “The next guy to turn.
to was Bruce. When he lost. we
went flat and never got regroup-

ed."

Unangst hadn’t wrestled all sea-
son but received a second seed on

the basis of last year. He drew

winning takedown came with 15

seconds left.

Following that loss. Larry Cuba
(130), Tom Grant (subbing for
Payne at 137). and Pat Lavery
(145) fell in quick succession, and
things looked really had until
Buddy Morris managed a win at

generate much momentum.

7 Thinclads ‘Left Out’

At N.C.A.A. Finals

by ED CONLEY
A Things got pretty exciting
. at the NCAA championship
i_.fJtrack meet in Detroit over the
weekend. but Jim Banner and his
thinclads who were there must
have f'elt left out when the action
reached its peak.

. Kansas and Villanova battled
down to the wire for the national
title. with the Jayhawks coming
out on top after Jim Ryun edged
the Wildcats‘ Marty Liquori in
the featured mile race. Both run-
ners crossed the finish line in

4:02.6. but the officials gave the

A win to‘Ryun by a few inches.

Jerry Richey was in that big
race. finishing sixth with a time
_of 4:07. Richey. however. had lit-
tle chance of upsetting either one
- , of the starts. The trackster got
caught in the pack and couldn't

— get out to challenge them.

“He ran well,” Banner said,
 « “but once he got caught it was too
5.. . late.”
. The other thinclads at the clas-
' - sic were farther away from the
best parts of the meet. Bryant
Salter looked like a strong varsi-
J; .1 ty entry until. he injured himself
'? on his first try in the triple jump
' and Smitty Brown failed to make
A , the cut-offs after the trials.

‘ . Salter traveled a distance of
 48'4" on his first attempt in the
 triple jump. He hurt his heel on
 f, the jump and had to bypass his
 other leap. taking seventh place
 in the event.

 

' was hurting, too — he couldn't go
» _ on,” Banner noted. “His first
 jump . . . he really looked good."

 

The" jumper" came back to test‘

the high jump field despite the
 injury. though. He couldn't do
 any beter than the starting height

 
 

 of '6'?" and had to leave the Mo-'
" tor City without placing in the_

 event.

 

, L” ' anyway. Ron_ Jordon of Florida
 _, won the event with a meet record

SMITTY BROWN
Inexperience Hurts

Brown saw less action than Sal-
ter. The speedster went to the na-
tionals with optimism after his
performances in the IC4A’s last
week. He was eliminated in the
trials in Detroit, though, after
clocking in at 1212.6 in the 600-
yard dash.

Banner figured that it was in-
experience that contributed to
Smitty's sub-par showing. Like
the other two thinclads. Brown is
a sophomore and this was his first
look at the nationals.

"I didn‘t run well at all." Smit-
ty decided. “I really ran a stupid
race." I

“I gained a lot of experience;
that will be a help,” he added,

Coach Bill Grant was pleased
with the performance of his div-
ing star. "Dave looked real good
in both of the events.“ he com-
mented. "He lost_to the winner
of the one meter dive by just 18
points. and he came very close to
coming in second or third. He
showed himself to be a top diver.
and proved that he can do well in
big meets.“

His performance in the East-
ern’s, earned Wessel a berth in
the National Championships to be
held this week at Bloomington,

Smitty should make it to the‘
nationals-next year. too. and he
probably won't get to view as
much of the competition from the
stands as he did this time. Ban-
ner knows this and is happy all
three of the sophs got to see what
the NCAA meet is like.

"They all did a good job get‘-
ting there. with all of them being
sophomores." he mentioned. “It
was a pleasure for me being
there." -'

Now. it‘s a three-day vacation
for the tracksters since the indoor
season is over. Wednesday or
Thursday they start to get ready

to finish only 17th in a field of 36 squads.

Sophomore Dave'Wessel was the only mermen who was able to
score points for the team. In the one meter dive. Dave finished in the

one and three meter dives.

None of the other tankmen
were able to place in the top 12
positions in any of the other
‘events. Likewise. the relay teams
were unable to place in the top

“Paul Allen did a very fine job.
It was the best he wrestled all
year." said Adams. Down 4-O af-
ter 20 seconds, Allen bounced back
to win his preliminary 9-7. He
met Co1gate’s Gene Detwiler. the
top seed. in the second round and
lost a controversial referee's split
decision after tying Detwiler 3-3 in
regulation and 1-1 in overtime.

Detwiler was injured and had to

default his-next match. thereby de-
priving Allen of a shot in the con-
solations.

Tom Grant. who spent most of the

year at 123. filled in for Payne at

' 137 and also received commenda~

tion. “Tom came down here not ex-
pecting to wrestle and he did a

nice job.“ Grant lost a tough con-

solation match. 5-4, to F&M’s John

Homiak, and could have won it’

the referee would have given him

a predicament on a close call.
