Faculty expresses discontent

‘By Ingrid Smith

The Pitt News

At the Senate Council meeting on

. Monday discontent was expressed

by faculty members to the adminis-
tration concerning the plan to evalu-
ate segments ‘ of the‘ university
departments.

According to Professor Jack Mat-
thews, the conﬂict began at the
Administration Assembly last week.
Matthews said that the planning
process to evaluate certain depart-
ments within the university by the
administration allowed faculty
members a period of 90 days to
express their concerns before any
decisions would be made by the
administration.

However, Matthews said that
some members of the faculty believe

Burned out

homeless.

—--—lnside Today

A fire last Saturday left some Pitt students

that they haven't been given the 90-
day period to make adjustments.
Furthermore, Matthews claimed
that certain faculty members feel as
though the administration has
already made certain decisions, dis-
regarding suggestions that have
been submitted.

“Some of the faculty at the
Administration Assembly became
very upset because it appeared that
decisions were being made by the
administration. However, on Mon-
day at the Senate Council meeting,
the administration claimed that
there haven’t been any decisions
made as of yet," said Matthews.
“However, there still seems to -be a
great distrust from the faculty
toward the administration.”

Matthews blamed the confusion
on a lack of communication between

administrators and faculty. “But tra-

ditionally, in any university,” he
added, “there has always been a cer-

tain amount of misunderstanding
between the administration and
faculty.”

The dream a

Speaker recalls  

King’s struggle

By Christopher L. Wells
The Pitt News

“Although I may not get to the

promised land, we as people will get

to the promised [and together.”
-—Martin Luther King Jr.

“It's not enough to celebrate King,
we have to vindicate him,” said
Lerone Bennett, senior editor for
Ebony Magazine, in a speech yester-
day commemorating Dr. Martin
Luther King’s birthday. The speech
was sponsored by Pitt’s _Black
Action Society. at

Bennett stressed that the King
crusade is real. “He is a living sym-
bol who speaks to us’. It is my con-
tention that it is not enough just tc.
celebrate him ~— we must have a
volunteer commitment to push on
his message for freedom, not only
for black America but for all of
America. We continue to struggle,
and it is the same as it was.”

King’s struggle for freedom in the
'60s is something that Bennett feels
should be alive today. “King showed
us how to struggle, how to dream
and*how to dare,” he said. However,
that dream is threatened by what
Bennett calls “the black depression.”
This depression is due to a lack of
spirit and affirmation within the
black community. “A new spirit of
reaction has made racism respecta-
ble,” Bennett said. “Never before
have we needed the King more.”

Bennett explained that King,
through his teachings, showed the
black community how to be strong
as a whole, thus creating an inner
satisfaction among individuals.

Another point that Bennett
stressed about King was the non-
violence (King called it the “love
ethic”) that he believed in and tried
to establish among his groups. King
believed that non-violence, which
was his way of life, was also a politi-
cal technique that promised certain
results in the 1960s. ‘Bennett
emphasized that today, non-
violence in black America has to

take precedence over crime. “If we
intend to do more than play the
game, we have to commit total
struggle for black love." Bennett
added that black people should
affirm themselves in their communi-
ties. “We’ve got to assume personal
responsibilties,” Bennett said. He
continued by saying, “We owe it to
Kings name to widen the circle and
to avoid back-biting and gossiping."

Bennett’s main point stressing the
idea of non-violence in black Amer-
ica was the notion that to advance
King's dream, the black community
must go out of their way and speak
to their fellow “brother and sister” to
build a strong communication force
among the people. “Let there be
peace and understanding in black
America,” Bennett said.

King dealt with the social forces
that were hurting his dream. Bennett
said that these forces were turning

King’s dream into a nightmare. To ,

overcome these social forces, Ben-
nett told the audience, to set up a
challenge for themselves “to live and
struggle and achieve goals.”

The final topic that Bennett talked
about was the need for the black
communities in America to pick up
King’s torch and take a stand against
political issues such as racism, mili-
tarism and socialism — issues that
King took a firm stance against.
Bennett said that some people were
“saving themselves for the revolu-
tion.” Bennett told those people to
make King’s light shine in their lives
today and ask themselves the ques-
tion, “What can I do to make sure
that King didn’t live, dream and die
in vain?”

Bennett went on to say that King “

lives, challenging, breathing in ev-
eryone’s lives.

In closing, Bennett told the
audience that the final gift in the
legacy of King was hope. Bennett
said, “We have not yet gotten to the
bottom of the King movement. The
dream cannot be saved unless it is
saved for everyone.”

Bennett ended his speech by again
quoting King in his final speech in
Memphis: “Keep the lamps trimmed
and burning  the work is almost
done."

Pitt joins in AIDS‘research

By DII1-I Kaufman
The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
recently joined a group of four other
universities in an intensive study of
the Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome. A new laboratory in the
Graduate School of Public Health
has just been funded and is slated for
completion in midsummer. The
National Institute of Health has
given Pitt $300,000 to complete the
laboratory.

Pitt will be working In conjunc-
tion with Johns Hopkins University
in Baltimore, Northwestern Univer-
sity in Chicago and the University of
California campuses in Berkeley and
Los Angeles. I A

Dr. Lnarles R. Rinaldo, assistant
professor of clinical pathology and
microbiology, said yesterday that
the funding for the laboratory will
be used to “help support and
develop new research at Pitt. We will
be looking more at the virus in an
attempt to analyze and characterize
It.” '
was discovered largely because of
the efforts of Dr. Robert C. Gallo of
the National Cancer Institute. The

virus is called HTLV-3 (for human
T-cell lymphotropic virus).

Rinaldo pointed out that the
focus of AIDS research has changed
dramatically since the discovery of
the virus that carries it. This virus.

At present, the Pitt men’s study,
which (researches) the factors that
cause the spread of AIDS among
men, has about 1,300 men under
study. Originally, they had expected
to accept 7,000 to 10,000 men for
study. The factor that changed the
number needed was the discovery of
HTLV-3. “We feel strongly that
HTLV-3 does cause AIDS. Before
we knew what virus caused the dis-
ease, we felt the need to cast a wide
net to determine first what caused
thedisease,” said Rinaldo. Nowthat
the probable source has been pin-
pointed, the amount of cases neces-
sary for accurate study has fallen off
sharply. Said Rinaldo, “Now that
we have a marker for the virus, we
do not need as many people."

Pitt was chosen as the center of
research because of the lack of
reported cases here. Researchers
hope to determine why there are
fewer cases here through study of
what the gay community here is
doing that enables them to avoid

contraction of the disease. There
have been only 20 cases reported in
Allegheny County, in comparison to
New York City, which has an aver-
age of 2,606 cases, and San Fran-
cisco, which has 826. These two
cities have the highest number of
recorded cases in the country. AIDS
has killed more than 3,000 people in
the last three years.

AIDS consists ofthe uncontrolled
destruction of cells that are the basic
structure of the body’s defense sys-
tem against disease. When these cells
are broken down, the body is left
defenseless against serious disease,
including pneumonia and a rare
form of cancer.

The research at the laboratory will
consist of interaction between the
five schools in the group called the
Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study.
The schools will share information
gathered and responsibility in cer-
tain phases of the research process.
Pitt will work “very closely with all
four other schools,” according to
Rinaldo. Extra work will be done
with the two closest schools, Johns
Hopkins and Northwestern.

The independent study that Pitt
does will revolve around the Pitt
men’s study and will attempt to
determine what causes the onset of
the disease. “What we have are
healthy young men carrying the
virus. We are trying to determine
why these healthy young men are
not showing signs of the disease,”
explained Rinaldo.

Rinaldo hopes that more funding
is on the way for an increase in
research. He said that the group is
negotiating for more funds from the
government, adding, “You can
never say that you have the money
until it has been approved, and even
then, you’re taking a chance.

Much debate has surrounded President Reagan’s
Strategic Defense Initiative, dubbed “Star Wars” by Sen.
Edward Kennedy. The president and his secretary of
defense, Caspar Weinberger, have hailed research into
the futuristic defense plan as a supreme humanitarian act.
Most members of the media, congress, andthe scientific
community have hailed Star Wars as a foolish idea con-
ceived by an old man too much enamored of modern
technology. The general public, meanwhile, seems to
have mixed and changing attitudes toward the scheme.
One might be inclined to believe, therefore, that there is
nosound and watertight argument concerning its value.

Not so!

_ Officially, the government has absolutely no idea
whether any such fantasy as Star Wars technology can be
» realized, what the device is to look like, what it shall be

made of, or whether it shall be land- or space-based. Over

the weekend the president’s select group of scientists

(who appear to be held in dim regard by their colleagues)

broached the subject of whether the device will shoot

lazer beams or particle rays. This is tantamount to won-
dering whether one ought to use a pigskin or cowskin ball
before even assembling a team or even a sport.

Meanwhile, Secretary of State George Schultz has
announced that he and the president hold Star Wars in
high esteem, and that the Soviets had better not entertain
the idea of making them scrap it while at Geneva. At one
point last week, the ability of the Reagan administration
and the Soviets to agree on a plan for the real limitation
of nuclear proliferation seemed threatened by that very
desire for Star Wars weaponry.

For perhaps the first time since the «beginning of the
arms race, the major nuclear powers of the world are all
in a position to give up dangerous weapons while not
losing credibility as world powers. The president, sadly,
wishes to haveall and to have it his way. One hopes that
the Soviets won’t decide to take their ball and go home, as
an insistence that they accept Star Wars as a sacred cow is
likely to inspire them to do. The Strategic Defense Initia-
tive holds all the value of a hole in the bottom of a

near-sinking ship.

Letters to the Editor

A Parody

The task force was of the opinion
that University of Pittsburgh inter-
collegiate athletic teams have not
fared well recently (e.g. football
1984) and also that their high costs
could and should be reduced at a
time when university resources are
increasingly limited. The task force
therefore recommends that individ-
ual sports be reorganized into larger
groups that combine sports with
similar purposes and methods. Such
a reorganization will result in a
smaller number of larger teams of all
the best players from the existing
separate and individual teams, ena-

bling these players to achieve inter-

disciplinary excellence in sports.
Marginal and low productivity play-
ers can be released and their uni-
forms and lockers assigned to new,
more productive recruits or to estab-
lished players as second uniforms
and overﬂow lockers.

There is no reason in today’s
world to perpetuate traditional
separate identities of sports. Sports
have more in common than they
have differences. For example, foot-
ball, soccer and basketball are
played with inﬂated bladders which
are run with, to and fro, or passed on
a court or ﬁeld to score points,
which are added to determine the
winner. Golf, baseball and hockey
are played with hard objects struck
with sticks, bicycle racing and foot
racing share common objectives,
and javelin, discus, caber and shot
throws are identical except for the
object thrown.

The new configuration for athlet-
ics at the university will be four divi-
sions: inflated bladder sports, stick
sports, propelled objects sports and
miscellaneous.

Consolidation of existing small,
numerous and scattered teams into
larger, comprehensive and central-
ized entities will make sports more
accessible to spectators (one loca-
tion), increase efficiency of the sta-
dium (utilized every day) and reduce
the number of trainers, officials,
ticket takers, etc., needed to support
the enterprise. The aggregation of
sports into larger entities will create
critical masses of resources (players,
balls, uniforms) that will attract out-
standing coaches who will win
games, increase attendance and TV
revenues and cause sports to flourish
at the university.

(Iniversity’s
Purpose

The university has been an impor-
tant part of my life for the past three
years, and going here says some-
thing about me. I always made it a
point to explain to people why I go
to Pitt. I grew up here, and going to
Pitt didn’t have the trappings of, say,
going to USC, but that was part of
why I liked it. The feeling I got
instead was that the philosophy here
was to bring all types of learning to
the people of western Pennsylvania
and the emphasis was on making it
available in these plain surround-
ings. Someone like myself, confused
about career ideas and plans, could
come to Pitt and find programs in
anything he wanted to study, pro-
grams to let him work and see differ-
ent fields, hands on, in health care,
social work, child development,
library sciences, journalism, etc. Pitt
let you see what it was like in virtu-
ally any field, and that was the key
for me. It meant a lot to me that the
whole picture of learning was there,
that this was not a professional or
trade school or a technical institute.
It meant a lot to have a geography
department. To call a department
“dead wood” because job opportun-
ities are limited or it does not bring
in big grants is to sell down the river

the educational system of which I
was proud to be a part.

The whole concept of “university”
learning hinges on the universality
of the pursuit of knowledge, the
enrichment of culture. From the first
outdoor university of the time of
Aristotle till now, “academic" stu-
dies that are not traditionally the
hottest or most lucrative fields have
been important nonetheless to give
thewhole picture. But the justifica-
tions demanded by the Five-Year
Plan committee have pushed this
emphasis on financial success and
on prestige in the media to absurd
lengths with the indefensable attacks
on the education, GSPIA, phar-
macy and other schools, all fine and
important to education and society.

Already, Pitt grads from around
the country have done much work to
stop the _, unbelievable Five-Year
Plan. Many Pitt grads now in the
legislature have been waiting impa-
tiently for the appropriations hear-
ings this year to take the university
administration to task on the irres-
ponsible proposals. In all the press,
‘none outside of the committee
speaks for the cuts.

The legislature has already begun
to take the administration officials
to task over the proposals. Several
members of the legislature, GSPIA
grads, have been waiting impatiently
for their chance to question the
administration officials at the
appropriations hearings. That very
small, non-representative group that
made the study was truly working in
a “hot-house” condition, feeding off
and believing in their own self-
importance, and hearing only their
own echoed voices’, pretty far
removed from rationality. To trust a
mystifyingly chosen and run com-
mittee and to, in the course of their
little study, redefine and reshape the
“mission” and goals ofthe university
isjust as foolish and irresponsible as
the Five-Year Plan and the com-
mittee itself. The situation has many
parallels to the Nixon White House,
with Posvar as the president and
Benjamin et al in any of the roles
from Dean to Nessen. I believe that,
in the context of learning as a whole,
it is clearly a mistake to cut whole
programs or take funding from tra-
ditional departments like mathe-
matics to build up the current hot
fields such as computers. It is a mis-
take on many levels. Perhaps the

’ most symbolic cuts of all are the cuts

to the school of education. Consi-
dered “dead wood,” the school has
been maimed by the committee and
“education” lies suffering, just from
the proposal of its dispensibility.
From a research point of view
alone, there is no value that can be
set on work done in the school of
Pharmacy, with Cyclosporin and
anti—rejection research, sickle-cell
anemia and anti-cancer drugs. No
foolish committee’s mathematics on
the size of grants can say a damn
thing about the death and suffering
to be saved and those being helped
right now by Pitt Pharmacy stu-
dents. One of those people is presi-
dent Posvar. The entire university
wishes him well as he recovers from
a painful bleeding ulcer at Presby.
He and his doctors as well use medi-
cations sent up to him in full confi-
dence ofthe finejob done in Presby’s
pharmacy by pharmacy students,
training and working to help pay for
their education here by working in
the many fine university health cen-
ter pharmacies. But forget all that,
forget the 100 percent employment
of pharmacy graduates. Consider if
such a committee had made its
recommendations before Jonas Salk
made his breakthrough. Consider
the millions oflives saved worldwide
by his vaccine, which was developed
here. Who are those people on that
committee anyway? They are no
authorities and clearly neigher rea-
sonable nor responsible. Even
further, though, putting all the eggs

in a few baskets, concentrating on
programs with “worldw1de reputa-
tions” is clearly folly of the worst

i kind. Every surgical resident in the

country would give his first-born to
be “matched” to Presby or Child-
rens, thanks to Starzl, Hardesty,
Rosenthal. et a1.-.nd the tremendous

surgery department here. This was

not always the case here, and not so
many years ago surgery was just an
average department. Now, in a big
city teaching hospital, there are
always opportunities for prospective
residents in cutting, for medical
companies in trying out new equip-
ment, but based on the lack of big
“grants coming in and its average sta-
ture worldwide, the department of
surgery in the school of medicine not
so many years ago could easily have
qualified for the committee’s axe
(hypothetically, for we all know that
surgery has always been one of the
most glamorous departments 21
school can offer). The problem is not
an isolated or logical one. The cuts
damage the whole university; learn-
ing suffers. We’ve got to realizejust
how enormous the cuts proposed in
the F ive-Year Plan are, how this tiny
group proposes to carry off such an
upheaval in our interest. *

S.B. Tomasic is right to be skepti-

' cal about the figure on Soviet geno-

cide. We should never accept serious
accusations casually. However, I
must add in this instance, the figure
of 67 million dead is quite plausible.
At least 50 million and perhaps as

many as 80 million people were mur— 1

dered by the Soviet government
between l9l7 and the present day.
Murder on that scale does not
always reduce population. Popula-
tions of countries are never static;
there is-always a turnover of births
and deaths. A nation of 200 million
people with a four percent birthrate
and a_ two percent deathrate expe-
riences four million’ deaths every
year, which is 40 million per decade
and,400 million per century. If the
death rate rose to 2.5 percent,
another 100 million would die in I00

years and the population would still .

increase.

In the case of the USSR, some 22
million peasants died in the forced
collectivization of agriculture and
the famine which followed in in the
1930s. Seven million people were
shot in the purges ofthe late ’30s and
nine million died in smaller purges
and mass deportations during
World War II. Between 20 and 40
million people died in the labor
camps under Stalin (from exposure,
starvation and shooting).

Although the Nazi holocaust has
received some attention lately, many
people are still unaware of what hap-
pened in any detail. I don’t know
why a country as suspicious of the
USSR as ours makes so little men-
tion of Soviet genocide. Of course,
the modern USSR is not Stalin’s
regime. Khruschev did his level best
to shut down the labor camps, and
the present “collective leadership"
policy may be an attempt to intro-
duce checks and balances into what
once was the world's most repressive
dictatorship. But we should not
forget that it is still the world’s most
powerful dictatorship, and that it
once murdered huge numbers of its
own people in the pursuit of rapid
industrialization and “national
security.“ -

A Guide to

The inauguration of President
Reagan is approaching and it prom-
ises to be a grandiose spectacle of
patriotic fervor. Reagan has speci-
fied that he wants for entertainment:
n3on-union, all—American per-
fofrmers who will work for free. This
is certainly his right, and it is hoped
that everything will go as planned. I
would like to suggest, within the
President’s guidelines, of course,
some acts which would most reson-
antly communicate the essence of
the Reagan administration and con-
temporary America as well. The
inauguration, after all, is supposed
to provide the country with a sym-

From Where I

bolic representation of the man
whom they choose to lead the free

world. Here follows my personal
vision.
The band, a I50-piece outfit

dressed in MP uniforms, half with
just crew cuts and half wearing large
white cowboy hats, would start the
festivities with an elegant version of
“Hooray for Hollywood." Follow-
ing that, they would proceed to play,
without breaks; every American
patriotic song imaginable, one
segueing into the next. They would
do this for as long as the inaugura-
tion takes, repeating some songs if
necessary.

Stand/

The first act would consist oftwo
rows of men and women, 20 to a
row, lined up on either side of Penn-
sylvania Avenue. Dressed in red,
white and bluejumpsuits and wear-
ing plastic, smiling Donny and
Marie masks, they would synchro-
nously beat, with gold-tipped Amer-
ican flags, 40 beefy hardhatted men
wearing black shirts that say “Local
666.” This performance would be
entitled “Reaming the Labor: A
Century-old Tradition.”

Next would come “Nancy’s
Cavalcade of Mutations," in which
Nancy, or a reasonable facsimile,
dressed in spangled spandex, would

Dirk Kaufman

dance in circles holding a long leash
with small black children, bag
ladies, welfare mothers, and other
non-“white bread“ types attached.
The nine or so leashed entertainers
would follow Nancy’s circles, with
the munchkins on the yellow brick
road as the prototype.

After the cavalcade, the parade
would start, headed by a long row of
papier-mache MX missles mounted
on pick-up trucks and straddled by
nubile young girls waving lassos.

Next would come the floats, the
first of which would be a huge red,
white and blue breast, nipple and all,
emblazoned with dozens of corpo-

rate logos. Periodically, a door in
the breast would open and a moving
statue of Ron would come out and
do a little waltz with the sparkling
dollar sign at the head of the ﬂoat.

Somewhere in the procession
would, of course, be Ron. In front of
his limo, Frank Sinatra would be
standing on a flatbed truck, with a
string quartet, crooning “Hail to the
Chief.”

Whether or not the organizers of
the inauguration follow up on any of
my suggestions, it will be a glorious
day of American pomp, befitting the
president who has put style back
into the White House.

The White

This is a story about white lines
and life. Vertical lines streaming
from edge to edge ofa random sea of
humanity. All of us will cross the
path of these lines at one time or
another in our lives, glancing from
side to side in anticipation of the
exact moment to take charge, move
on, step out into the black, fast-
moving asphalt river that is part of
the environment of the white line. I
speak, of course, of the great Ameri-
can crosswalk.

In this case there is a particular
crosswalk that affects me. The lines
that run to the sidewalks ofthe Wil-
liam Pitt Union and the Cathedral
are filled with stories of near tragedy
and tragedy itself. Only yesterday on
my way to class, I witnessed the fear
and rage that comes about from
merely crossing the street.

As it happened, the time was
around I p. m. and many were out in
the cold, heading for class or lunch

or what have you. Now, if you can
imagine 18 degrees and the neces-
sary apparel, you will see many
bundled—up people wearing scarves,
hats, gloves, heavy coats and
upturned collars, with eyes squint-
ing from the cold wind. Many of us
stood on the edge of the road, or in
the middle of the road. In this kind
of weather, objective No. I is to get
your body indoors as soon as possi-
ble. Glancing from side to side, we
dashed and darted between cars
making their way downtown.

In the middle of this chaos, one
girl trotted quickly ahead of the
crowd, making her dash for the
other side. A greer: Pontiac sped
toward her, hoping to beat the
changing light. Their respective
paths were moments from meeting
when both screeched to a halt; The

to begin breathing again, then took
advantage of the chance to finish
crossing the road. Perhaps the thing
I recall most clearly was watching
the girls knee approach the bumper
and vice versa. It was a gruesome
experience. The other strange thing
was that we all felt ashamed that we
were crossing the street.

When I got to the sidewalk on the
Cathedral side, I heard a man blurt
out within earshot of the girl, per-
haps to comfort her in some way,
“Motorists don’t even know what a
crosswalk is.” The interesting thing
is that all of us that were crossing the
street at that time were sometime
motorists. So, what have we here?

Are the people behind the wheel at
fault? Or is the cold pedestrian who
steps in front of a moving automo-
bile taking his or her own chances
and therefore responsible for the
wreck, should it happen?

In this case, perhaps because I was

so close to the incident (not to men-

with a quick gesture and silent

Jobless

Congressman William J. Coyne
last Friday charged that the recently
released national unemployment
figures which show only a slight rise
in the jobless ’ rate dramatically
underestimate the level of unem-
ployment in economically distressed
regions of the country.

The real rate of unemployment in
the Pittsburgh metropolitan area,
according to Coyne, is substantially
higher than the 10.4 percent claimed
by the Department of Labor for
October, 1984.

“The Department of Labor tells
us that the national unemployment
rate is 7.2 percent. That figure does

not count as unemployed the 5.6

million workers who, in December,
1984, were working part time for
economic reasons, nor does it
include the 1.3 million so-called
‘discouraged’ workers who have

1 given up looking for nonexistent

jobs,” Coyne said.

“Exactly how many underem-
ployed and discouraged workers
there are in the Pittsburgh area is
difficult to determine statistically,”
said Coyne, who represents Pennsyl-
vania’s 14th Congressional District.
“But the figures released recently by
the Full Employment Action Coun-
cil reflect more accurately the depth
of the jobs problem in our area.”

According to the council, which is
a coalition of labor, religious and
urban groups, the “real rate” of
unemployment for the Pittsburgh
metropolitan area, which factors in
underemployed and discouraged
workers, was 18.5 percent in
October, 1984. The October rate
listed by the Labor Department for
the Pittsburgh area, which did not
include underemployed or discour-
aged workers, was 10.3 percent.

“The Administration’s acceptance
of a national unemployment rate of
7.2 percent as ‘good news‘ rings a
little hollow in Pittsburgh," Coyne
said. “The Full Employment Action
Council estimates on ‘real rates’ of
unemployment puts Pittsburgh at
the top of the list in joblessness
among the nation’s 20 largest metro-
politan areas.

“When we look at the big picture
on joblessness, Pittsburgh is clearly
no better off now than it was four
years ago," the Pittsburgh Demo-
crat stated. The council estimated
the “real rate” of unemployment in
the Pittsburgh metropolitan area as
l l.7 percent in October, 1980, com—
pared to 18.5 percent in October,
l984. ,

The threatening smell of smoke
and charred wood still lingers. Piles
of broken glass and rusty nails lie
near the doorway, and massive ceil-
ing beams are strewn about the soot-
covered floor.

The blaze that tore through the
apartment houses in the 3,500 block
of the Boulevard of the Allies left in
its path $150,000 in damages. There
were a few who were lucky enough
to have the fire spare their apart-
ments and their personal
belongings.

Ling Zhang, a University of Pitts-
burgh student studying in the
department of linguistics, lived in
one of the row houses that was des-
troyed by the blaze. Zhanf said, “We
were talking until about the time the
fire began. My roommate said he
smelled cooking gas, and then we
saw smoke coming from the apart-
ment house next door. We called the
Fire Department and they came
immediately.” Zhang has been in the
United States for a short time, and
he is presently staying with'a friend
until he can find a new place to live.

The Red Cross and Howard
Johnson’s let the homeless victims
stay in their buildings until today.
The YMCA also housed about 20
people.

Another "university student was
living in one ofthe apartment houses
when the fire began. Mahmoud
Abdelgawad, an Egyptian student
studying in the Department of Lin-
guistics, was lucky enough to escape
injury, and his apartment has no
damage except for a broken door.
He was sleeping at the time of the
fire, ‘which fire officials said began at
approxiamately 2:28 a.m. on Satur-
day morning. “I was sleeping whena

friend of mine who lives downstairs
said he smelled smoke. I was still in
my pajamas when I left my apart-
ment.” Mahmoud hasbeen in this
country exactly one year.

Fire officials have determined the
cause of the blaze to be arson. The
owner of the building, Nafesa I.

Jayarawau, is now visiting his home-
land of India; he cannot be reached
for comment.

If the homeless victims are having
trouble paying for another apart-
ment’s rent, they can contact the
Red Cross who will pay for the first
month’s rent.

Applications are now being
taken for the positions of Editor-
in—Chief and Business Manager

will be accepted no later than

Discovery

Beauty found in
microscopic photos

By Ilona Segedy
The Pitt News

Man has been probing the myster-
ies of the infinite from the time he
looked to theheavens. His desire to
comprehend what his naked eye
can’t see has culminated in a quest
that penetrates the invisible inner
world of matter -- those atoms,
molecules and unseen particles from
which our visible world is made.
This search has revealed strange
shapes and colors, dramatic and
unfamiliar beauty.

The world of technology is no
exception and has a beauty of its
own. AT&T revealed just how
intriguing and compelling the hid-
den art of high technology is in
“Microscapes,” a major photo-
graphic exhibition running until
Feb. 17 at the Hunt Library,
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
exhibit is on a 2-year, l2-city tour of
the United States.

This unusual exhibit of 47 origi-
nal, large-format color, and black
and white photographs focuses on

, the seldom seen world of advanced

developments in microelectronics
and lightwave communications. The
exhibit reveals that technology is
more than applied science ~ the

materials and processes that fashion .

modern electronics produce a

microscopic landscape rich in
images and colors.

The subjects of most ofthe photo-
graphs, taken by AT&T photo-
graphers and scientific researchers
in the course of their work in the
development of advanced communi-
cations systems, are unrecognizable
and thus intriguing. Substances
magnified many times their original
size appear to assume new identities.
The diffraction pattern of a helium-
neon laser looks more like rings
around a low-lying moon; a silicon
chip for echo-free conversations
resembles the American flag; corro-
sion pits on copper film metamor-
phose into a golf ball; and a
soldering iron tip appears to be a
cross section of a tree trunk.

The photographs reveal strange
and colorful landscapes that are rich
in shapes, shades, textures and hues
which are typically inaccessible to
most photographic techniques.
These techniques are so advanced

that some of the photographs were a

shot at exposure speeds of
l/720,000th of a second, with mag-
nifications of up to 67,000 times the
actual image size.

N In addition to the artistic elements
of the exhibit, “Microscapes” is also
of value for children and adults as it
includes freestanding displays that
demonstrate the technology of
advanced microelectronics.

Israeli troops pull out

ISRAEL (UPI) — Israel_plans to
begin pulling l0,000 troops out of
Lebanon in five weeks, but Israeli
leaders vow the Jewish state will not
tolerate a recurrence of guerrilla
border attacks.

Both Prime Minister Shimon
Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin warn that ifthe PLO or what
they call “terrorist elements” resume
attacks, Israel will respond quickly
with military force.

Israel invaded southern Lebanon
more than two-and-a-half years ago.
It justified the move as a bid to wipe
out Palestinian rebel strongholds
that threatened northern border

Monday, the Israeli cabinet voted
16-6 in favor of a three-stage with-
drawal. The first phase will be to
withdraw from southwestern
Lebanon. Later, troops will draw
back from the eastern Bekaa valley.

Still later, they'll leave the country

entirely.

Lebanon has yet to give an official
response to the plan. Israel broke off
U.N.-sponsered talks with Lebanon‘
last week.

News of the withdrawal arrives
with a new threat to ﬁve Americans
kidnapped in Beirut.

A Moslem fundamentalist group
that claims to be holding them said
the five will be “tried” as alleged U. S.
spies. The Islamic Jihad also claims
responsibility for killing two French
observers Monday. It said they, too,
were spies.

NATO facility bombed

BRUSSELS, Belgium (UPI) —
There has been another bomb attack
on a NATO facility in Europe. This
time, it’s in Brussels, Belgium, where
a car bomb exploded outside a
NATO library early this morning,
slightly injuring: two guards and
causing extensive damage. The
group Communist Combatant Cells
claimed responsibility in a call to a
Belgian newspaper.

Brazil cheers democracy.

BRAZIL (UPI) —— A huge banner
hung outside the Brazilian congress
yesterday read “Good Morning
Democracy." The country is choos-
ing a civilian president to effectively

end 21 years of military rule. Crowds‘

have gathered in city squares
throughout the country in a carnival
atmosphere of samba bands and
folk dancing.

Accident still unsolved

WEST GERMANY (UPI) -
Rocket experts investigating the
Pershing-2 missile accident that
killed three U.S. soldiers in West
Germany last week said they’ve
found nothing to explain why the

page 9

fuel in the missile ignited. An Army
spokesman for the group said a
motor was being moved with a crane
when the fuel in it caught fire.

Teens shot at checkpoint

BELFAST (UPI) — An incident
at a security checkpoint outside Bel-
fast left one teenager dead and four
companions injured early yesterday.
Police said an army patrol opened
fire on a car that tried to get past the
checkpoint. Three soldiers suffered
minor injuries. Police said the
youths were joyriders —— not sus-
pected terrorists. The 17-year-old
boy was the first person to be killed
in Ulster this year.

Chernenko ill

BULGARIA (UPI) — A Warsaw
Pact conference set for yesterday in
Bulgaria has been postponed for an
indefinite period, apparently
because Soviet President Cher-

nenko is too ill to attend. The official ».

Soviet news agency Tass has made
no mention of Chernenko’s health in
announcing the summit delay. But,
sources in Moscow said the 73-year-
old Chernenko’s illness ruled out
what would have been his first trip
abroad since succeeding Yuri
Andropov last February.

Winter grips Europe

(UPI) — Europe is still fighting a
record cold wave. The continent got
more snow today, causing the
Danube river to freeze and driving
wolves into Hungarian cities in
search of food. In Romania, snow-
drifts of six to seven feet built up and
energy shortages reached emergency
levels. The Italian region ofTuscany
sought disaster aid and more than
one-and-a-half feet of snow fell on
Spain’s Costa Brava beaches.
Almost 250 deaths have been
blamed on the weather in the last l0
days.

Events planned to honor '

birthday of King

(UPI) — Speeches and marches
are planned across the country in
honor of Martin Luther King Jr.,
the civil rights leader who would
have been 56 years old yesterday.

But many also will be targeted at
specific alleged abuses or aimed at
the policy of racial separation in
South Africa.

Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massa-
chusetts is addressing the apartheid
system in speeches to Boston
audiences. He just returned from a
trip to South Africa.

In Childersburg, Ala., a march
protested the shooting of a 15-year-
old black boy last month. Police said
they thought the boy was armed but
no gun was found.

The Rev. John Nettles, who led
the march, said there are “a lot of
Childerburgs in Alabama.” And if
King were alive today, Nettles said,
he would be marching with them.

iWarship causes dispute

(UPI) — A verbal standoff has
developed between the United
States and Nicaragua over a U.S.
warship and what it may or may not
be not carrying.

Nicaragua charged Monday in a
pro-government newspaper that the
USS Nimitz — the biggest aircraft
carrier in the U.S. ﬂeet —— '3 posted
off Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast.

The Sandinista paper further
charged the Nimitz has 40 planes
armed with nuclear weapons.

The United States has declined to
discuss the allegation. Military sour-
ces in Washington said the Nimitz
left Norfolk, Va., last week, but they
refused to comment further.

First Lady irritated

(UPI) — First Lady Nancy Rea-
gan said it “irritates” her to hear sug-
gestions that President Reagan is a
“disengaged" leader who lets aides
run the White House. She told UPI
the suggestions, which she called
“i-naccurate," also annoy her
husband.

Raw milk disputed

(U Pl) —- The government is under
a court order to decide whether to
outlaw sales of raw (unpasteurized)
milk. The Food and Drug Adminis-
tration has been trying to get it off
the market for a dozen years as a
health threat. It estimates there are
about one million Americans who
drink raw milk.

The school district said today that
as a result ofthe poor showing, 8,796
additional students will be enrolled
in specialized reading and math
classes.

A preliminary analysis of the Tells
Program by school officials found
most of the students identified as
eligible for remedial aid are already
receiving academic assistance.

School officials found that about
45 percent of students not enrolled
in special education classes failed the
math test while about 51 percent
failed the reading test. .

Of all the special and regular
classes combined, 57 percent failed
the math test and 64 percent failed
the reading test.

Reactor restart a maybe

HARRISBURG (UPI) — Local
officials want to make sure south-
central Pennsylvanians know — and
complain — about the possibility of
a Nuclear Regulatory Commission
vote to restart the undamaged Three
Mile Island nuclear reactor. Offi-
cials said they want citizens to voice
their opposition to TM]. The NRC
is reportedly close to voting on re-
starting the plants undamaged
reactor.

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) — Offi-
cials said Philadelphia Electric’s
evacuation plan for the area sur-
rounding the Limerick nuclear
power plant in Montgomery County
isn’t adequate in the event of an
emergency.

Officials told the Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission Monday
that inefficient planning is among
the problems with PE’s proposed
escape procedure.

Students’ rights upheld

HARRISBURG (UPI) — Legis-
lation to allow child victims of sex-
ual abuse to give their court
testimony by videotape is needed to
give children a fighting chance in the
legal system, according to the bill’s
sponsors. Senators Stewart Green-
leaf and Michael O’Pake said Mon-
day they introduced the legislation
and hope for its speedy approval.

Easy As It Looked, St. J ohn’s Cruises by Pitt

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

Really, he tried to be as diplo-
matic as possible about the carnage
his basketball team had wrought.
The sincerity is emphasized because
Lou Carnesecca remembered the
last two losses St. John's suffered at
Fitzgerald Field House and he knew
the Redmen would easily be damned
to revengehood by Pitt for any sign
of mercilessly disfiguring the
Panthers.

One revealing action was. leaving
Chris Mullin and center Bill Wen-
nington — the two combining for 29
points and 13 big rebounds ~— in
until two minutes remained before
the Panthers fell to 9-4, l-2. Another
was the suffocating offense Carne-
secca deployed until a buzzer shot
that gave St. .Iohn’s two more
points, although it had this one
wrapped and ready to go with Shel-
ton Jones’ 5:36 layup, spreading the
margin to a second-half high of 22.

Carnesecca need not have wor-
ried, despite a Cold War handshake
with Coach Roy Chipman after-
ward, since the Panthers’ inside,
offensively and defensively, self-
destructed. Still, Carnesecca played
it safe after the 87-56 whack in the
face.

“Yeah, you’re right, Pitt missed
shots tonight,” he said of Pitt’s 35.8
percent from the field against St.
John’s 64.7. “IfI missed those shots,
I'd be saying the same thing. That’s
it, in a nutshell. But ifl did say that,
I'd be out of ajob.”

“Where we were hurting, we were

not taking the best shots in the
world,” Chipman said. “The halls
weren't going in the goal. That sort
of broke our backs.”

St. John’s performed like any 12-
1, 4-0 record would indicate. It
taught the suddenly struggling
Panthers the essence of playing for
keeps in the Big East. Even more, it
told 6,670 fans that Mullin can blend

in, his standout play is that equaled
by his teammates.

“They put on a clinic,” Chipman
added. “We played like a young
team."

What was earlier a careless game
took a more definite mold when
Mullin, left winging them, canned
four shots midway through the first
half, sparking the Redmen to their
38-25 halftime lead. He collected 12
points by then, got only two more
later and missed only onejumper all
night. This, after he shrugged off a
technical and vocal harrassment.

“We were going to the side with
Walter [Berry] and Willie [Glass],
then Chris takes the pressure off by
dropping those bombs,” Wenning-
ton said. “It hurts teams. It takes it
out of [opposing teams] when you
can open it up like that.”

“Mullin just got into the seams of
our zone,” Chipman added.

They were more like canals. Ber-
ry’s 15 points, not to mention moves
that dazzled, matched Wennington’s
output while guard Mark Jackson
coasted in with 13 and a game-high
eight assists.

On defense, St. John’s played the
man —- quality unaffected by and
unprejudiced toward substitutes.

“St. John’s had a lot of opportuni-
ties we didn’t get as far as fast
breaks, loose balls that helped them
out,” said Keith Armstrong, Pitt’s
center, who sat out the second half.
Armstrong, a junior who seemingly
found his way at the pivot last
month, has, after two games, drawn
the ire of Chipman.

Against St. .Iohn’s he had no
rebounds while committing two
turnovers in 16 minutes of play. In
the loss to Connecticut, Armstrong
could muster only six boards.

“Here I got a center at 6-9, 240
lbs., who can’t get a rebound in the
first half,” Chipman fumed. “I don’t
know what to do to motivate him.
He’s yet to work. He’s got to do
something. I don’t know what’s
going through his mind.”

Dabkowski’s gymnastics career is over due to tendon injury

 

Injury ends gymnast’s career

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

-—-Press Box

Brooklyn Ruler

St John's guard Chris Mullin stuck to close to
home when choosing what college to attend.

See page I3.

It seems unfair when a person
struggles for years to attain a dream
only to have that dream shattered by
one slight mishap -~ an injury that
ends a career. Last year as ajunior,
Debbie Dabkowski had her best sea-
son as a Pitt gymnast, setting her
collegiate highs in all events. She
was looking forward to an even bet-
ter year with the gymnasts as a
senior, but an unfortunate incident
crushed her hopes ofever competing
again.

‘‘I tore my Achilles’ tendon at the
end of September, tumbling. I knew
right away that I tore it and that I
would be done. This was going to be
better than last year, and last year
was my best year," said Debbie. “I
was pretty upset about that. I
thought I’d be letting the team down
because I wouldn't be competing."

Easy Does it

The Pitt wrestling team anticipates a lightweight
Youngstown squad.

See page 16.

It wouldn’t be unusual for an ath-
lete to turn bitter after such a
mishap, but Debbie feels that her
coach and teammates were very sup-
portive. Although she is unable to
compete, Debbie remains a very
active part ofthe Lady Panther gym-
nastics team.

She said: “They even elected me
captain  even after they knew I
wasn’t going to be competing all
year. I was really surprised when I
found out. I like to go up every day
to help out a little. Even if I can't
compete I still try to give them some
support.”

According to teammate Kristy
Picters, Dabkowski has not lost her
passion for gymnastics even after
her injury. “Before Debbie got hurt
she was an excellent gymnast. She
interacted with everyone on the
team well. Then she got hurt. But she
still goes to practice and her enthusi-
asm is still there. That helps our
team tremendously.“

kowski began her gymnastics career
at the age of 11. She competed at a
private club before she decided to

attend Pitt. As a freshman, she was"

unable to compete after knee
surgery, and she spent her sopho-
more year concentrating on rebuild-
ing her strength. Last year was an
exciting one for Dabkowski; her
highest scoring events were the floor
and uneven bars.

“I always liked the ﬂoor and I
hated the bars but I came to like the
bars when I came to Pitt and it ended

up being my best scoring event, too,” /

Dabkowski said.

The only senior on a predomi-
nantly freshman team, Dabkowski
is currently attending physical ther-
apy sessions to help regain mobility
in her leg. She doesn’t feel she will be
returning to gymnastics even after
recovery except possibly to coach
part-time in her old gym back home.

‘Funnyman’ Garren still can improve his routines

The Pitt News, Wednesday, January 16', I985

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

In any team‘s season, the time for
oddsmakers to make predictions is
early on when they know they won’t
have to pay for their mistakes until
later. Specialists such as Jimmy
“The Greek” and Pete Axthelm con-
tinue to amaze audiences with their
abominable percentages of success.
The case. of sophomore gymnast
Kevin Garren, however, would
make any analyst forecast the year
1985 to be successful in all respects.

After a strong freshman year,
Garren missed last season with a
medical redshirt. This year should
upstage his first, as Garren is
expected to make a huge contribu-
tion to the men’s squad.

Garren is known as a comic,
according to assistant coach Dave
Smith. “He’s funny and comical in
practice and in public but still saves
his strong, competitive attitude
when it counts,” he said. “He is defi-
nitely a key to the stability of this
team."

While a freshman at Reading
Central Catholic High School Kev-
in’s interest in gymnastics was
sparked by his soccer coach. A short
while later, Garren joined a gymnas-
tics club in Reading, which enabled
him to master his basic moves,
greatly benefiting his pursuit of the
sport at the college level. His interest

“As soon as his [Garren’s]
routines improve, his
scores will skyrocket  ”

—Frank D’Amico

in Pitt increased after he was offered
a scholarship, but Garren com-
mented that his positive impression
of the campus sealed his decision on
coming here.

Even with an athlete of Garrens‘
caliber, head coach Frank D’Amico
feels that with any athlete, there is
always a need for improvement.
“We can always depend on Kevin to
produce, although he still hasn't
done his best yet,” D’Amico
remarked. “He’s still not making sets
and routines with consistency, as
evidenced by his performance this
past weekend. As soon as his rou-
tines improve, his scores will
skyrocket.”

Because he competes in the all-
around, however, Garren must
exhibit well-balanced skills. In plac-
ing third in all-around competition
in Pennsylvania his junior year of
high school, he proved his posses-
sion of those true skills but said that
“competing in California and Utah
during 1980" had to be one of his
biggest thrills. Kevin's long-term
goals — “To make Nationals, All-
East, and maybe someday an All-
America.”

Garren looks for big year

Garren respects D’Amico's coaching
methods which are an important
reason for his attending Pitt.

He said, “His training techniques
are solid and he never pushes more
than we can handle — he’s very‘
injury-conscious.”

Because of the squad’s slow start,
it could be expected that the team
spirit may be a little low. However,
this isn’t the case. As Garren adds,
“If we come together and work hard
enough, this team has the potential
to definitely break into the Top 20.”

The Panthers will take to the road
this Saturday to compete at the
James Madison Invitational. This
will be their second meet of the sea-
son after bringing home a win over
Temple last Saturday, and they are
hoping to improve upon their pre-
vious scores.

“We have a couple of injuries on
the team now but I don’t think it will
hold us back much," said Pieters.
“We won our first meet with only a
week’s practice. I think we should do
pretty well.”

According to sophomore Alisa
Spector, the team’s goal is to hit this
meet better than their first meet and
to keep improving with each compe-
tition. “We just want to go up and up
and up until we hit regionals,” said
Spector,

Captain Debbie Dabrowski will
be there to help.her team pull off
another Victory and to offer support.
“Debbie has a lot of courage and
she’s a good role model for our
team,” said Spector. “As a captain
we couldn’t ask for a better one.”

Q‘

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

It looked like a good day for a
basketball game -— anything
indoors, really. The snow was falling
from a dismal sky, resting only on
more snow, and the temperature was
dropping with the sun.

Indeed, Monday did prove to be a
good day for basketball, at least for
St. John’s. The Redmen had no
trouble in disposing of the Pitt
Panthers 87-56 at the Fitzgerald
Field House. The Redmen have little

trouble with most teams they play -

because of the efforts of Chris Mul-
lin, the All-Everything senior from
Brooklyn, N.Y.

Mullin pumped in 14 points on
Monday, two below his season aver-
age. But that statistic tells only a
fraction of-what Mullin means to the
team. He is the unquestioned team
leader. Mullin handles the ball more
than anybody else on the floor and
he plays more minutes than any
other Redman (averaging 38 min-
utes per game this season). Clearly it
is an obvious truth, “As Mullin goes,
so goes St. John’s."

But characteristically, Mullin
passed the credit around after Mon-
day’s blowout. “My points come
because of my teammates. They are
the ones who allow me to get open
and in position to take shots. I don’t
do'it alone.” Somehow, Mullin also
found something good to say about
Pitt’s performance. “I wouldn’t take
anything away from Pitt. They have
a great team. They are very physical
underneath. They play a lot like a
Big Ten team thay way." But even
one of the game’s premier players

’was at a loss when asked to explain

the overwhelming St. John’s win. “I
really can't say why. I don’t know if
it was nervousness or tentativeness
63 iliéif part 6? what. But the margia
of victory is really irrelevant. We
played good and we won; that’s all
that matters. Ifyou win by 100 or by
two, it’s still the same."

*****

Monday was the type of day Chris
Mullin must have seen many ofdur-
ing his youth in Brooklyn — the type
of day when the snow falls on Flat-
bush Avenue and quickly turns to
slush under the never-ending traffic.
And it was on those types of days,
over on Troy Avenue, that Chris
Mullin would learn to play basket-
ball. He learned it better than most.

Basketball became more for Mul-
lin than a game to play when it was
cold, and when most kids concen-

wtrated on the fundamentals of hit-
Lifting and sliding in Brooklyn little

ball. He would look for a game
wherever he could find one, in the
gym after school, in the playground,
in his driveway with his brothers.
Anywhere. Just play some ball.

The Legend of Chris Mullin
began when'he played his first game
for Xaverian High School. Mullin
was a transfer from the aptly named
Power Memorial High in Manhat-
tan, the school that sent, among oth-
ers, Kareem-Abdul Jabbar to
national basketball prominence. But _
Mullin had a run-in with Power’s
coach and he packed his bags back
to Brooklyn. In his first time in a
Xaverian uniform, Mullin had 38
points and he eventually led the
team to the New York state
championship.

Courted by most Eastern basket-
ball powers, Mullin opted instead
for nearby St. John's, one borough
away in Queens. The place will never

, be the same. “A once in a lifetime

player” is how St. John’s coach Lou
Carnesecca describes Mullin. The
St. John’s basketball yearbook

_ simply says he is “the most honored

 

,Chris Mullin’s Star Still Rising

player in St. John’s history." In his
seasons at St. John’s, the Redmen
are 67-26. Mullin has shown St.
John’s the way to a national promi-
nence greater than they have ever
had. There are so many impressive
statistics and awards that they
become monotonous and lose their
meaning when piled on top of each
other (things like 33 points vs.
Georgetown last February, first

team All'Big-East two years, two,

consecutive years of at least a share
in the Big East Player of the Year
Award, Big East Tournament MVP,
an Olympic Gold Medal, first-team
UPI All-America, etc.).

Virtually the only thing Mullin
has yet to accomplish at St. John’s is
winning the national championship.
But there is still his ﬁnal NCAA
tournament to come.

forget. With 10 seconds leftinatied-

Bruce Closes in on Record

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

The Pitt women's basketball team
takes its 3-2 conference record north
when it faces the Eagles of Boston
College tonight at Chestnut Hill.

Jennifer Bruce is fresh off of a
25-point performance against Seton
Hall on Saturday night and is slowly
closing in on Clyde Vaughan’s
career scoring mark of 2,033 points.
Bruce“ shattered the women's mark
of 1,941, previously held by Debbie
Lewis (Junie’s sister), against Seton
Hall.

Joining Bruce on the front line
will be senior Ellen Gilhooley and
sophomore Jenny Tyner. Tyner, a
6-5 center, has begun to come into
her own after being hampered by
inconsistency earlier in the year.
Tyner tossed in 14 points and
blocked four shots against Seton
Hall, and will be looked to for the
same type of play against Boston
College.

Kim Tirik and Lisa Fubio will be
Pitt’s outside threats at the guard
positions. Both players scored in
double figures at Seton Hall, and the
pair also added eight assists and
eight steals.

Boston College will counter with 3

some fire power of its own. The
Eagles boast the league’s third lead-

The Eagles are under the direction

ings for team defense throughout ~

to put forth a solid team effort ifthey
want to move closer to the top spot
in the conference. Kim Gannis and
Stephanie Collins will be key players
off the bench for Pitt.

Pitt is 2-1 on the road this year,
and Coach Judy Saurer’s squad will

the season. Pitt returns home to face

In a blind fit of reasoning, the
extended meeting was premature —
given the 13 remaining conference

‘ games -- and in want of explanation

besides the anesthetizing loss.

St. John’s had just runeup the fat-
test point advantage as a foreign
team in nearly 20 years at Fitzgerald

The Panthers craved no such reas-‘V
surance. One court appearance with "

the Chris Mullin, Bill Wennington
and Walter Berry personalities is
enough to alter the earlier formu-
lated anticipations begotten from
“on paper.” A 31-point loss made
believers out of the blue and gold.
It also escorted them into this lit-
tle predicament, a two-game losing
skid. The treadmarks are relatively
fresh, too new to conduct a team
captains’ meeting after the coach

'35? does his thing?

Viewpoint

Ah, but the two-gamer will likely
balloon to four with Georgetown
and Boston College (on the road)
beckoning. After Coach Roy Chip-
man went through the standard

post-op procedures administered.‘-,

following such unmistakable mis-
matches, seniors Chip Watkins and
Andre Williams prescribed some of
their own medication.

“It seems every year I’ve been

I here, we’ve gone through the trauma

of losing four Big East games [in a
row],” Watkins said, staring at a
ﬂoor.h“We’re trying to avoid it
[again]. In past years, we go into a
slump and we just have to let the
younger players know it’s not the
end of the world.”

The Louisville product left the“

basketball-crazy state of Kentucky
not knowing that Pitt would, one
year later, join the Big East. Since
that commitment, quality in the
Northeast has since surpassed that
in blue grass country. But not with-
out a price — for the Panthers.

In two years of conference play
they have registered three 0-4
stretches against Big East members.
Excluded here is the first-round
playoff loss to St. John’s in 1983,
introducing a five-game losing
streak that would expand to eight
before Pitt rearended St. John’s last
year.

Now in their third Big East year,
the Panthers can easily become the
least of the nine. Saturday at noon
Georgetown tips off before what is
expected to be a capacity crowd of
16,532 (largest in Pittsburgh basket-
ball history). By then it should be
I6-0 after tonight’s home lab experi-
ment against Providence.

Expect the usual. Coming into the
week, Patrick Ewing was hitting for

the league. Michael Jackson, a sharp
point man, heads the assists board
with 7.2 a game. Factor in some
more double scoring for Bill Martin,
David Wingate and Reggie
Williams.

Does anyone see a leak in there?
Does someone believe Pitt is going
to do what no one has since St.

Md., win last year? In February.
Nearly a year ago.

Gymnasts learn in Chicago

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

The men's gymnastics team (0-2)
left for Chicago this past weekend
with one goal in mind: victory. Their
I I-hour trip was spoiled at the hands
of Western Michigan and the Uni-
versity of Illinois (at Chicago). With
junior All-East performer Mark
Klafter sitting out with tendonitis,
the Panther squad managed to score
249 total points — three behind
Western Michigan and six behind
Illinois.

Assistant coach Dave Smith com-
mented, “Normally, we should be
close to the 265 range. Mark's
absence had some effect because we
had to go with some inexperience.
They did a good job for us, though.”

The Panther squad received
strong showings from Ed Miller on
rings, Kevin Garren and Matt Peters
on high bar and Mike Mealie on the
horse. Additional stand-outs
included Steve Powanda on vault
and Peters on parallel bars.

Junior Marty Comini said of the
results, “I never felt lower since I've
been here. We were capable of hit-
ting but just didn't." He added, how-
ever, “This meet has been a learning
experience for the entire team. Our
unity held together during the low
times. We just have to put it in the
past now.”

The attitude at this week's prac-
tice is optimistic, looking forward
to the James Madison Invitational
this weekend. Klafter, who will com-
pete, said: “Come Friday, we’re
going to need consistency. By just
mtting our routines we should do

Hitting routines was something
they couldn't manage in Chicago,
missing nearly 20 of 35. Smith
attributed the defeat to this inconsis-
tency. “Because it was our first meet
of the season, I think we were a bit
rusty and weren't totally ready.

The Panthers will not be faced
with much of a challenge tonight
when they face the Youngstown
State Penguins. Why? The Penguins
are not able to field a full team.

“Youngstown is definitely strug-
gling this season, and they shouldn't
pose too much of a problem when
considering the overall outcome,”
explained head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer. “Yet their team [has]
members who can contend for indi-
vidual wins.” ‘

Those individuals include Dom
Mancini and his brother, Frank,
who will be challenging Pitt's John
Hnath at 126 lbs. and Steve Frank at
142 lbs., respectively. Panther Ken
Hackman will face Aquilino Mora-
los at 177 lbs. By the time Youngs-
town fields Rich Brunot at heavy-
weight, the Panthers hope the
match’s outcome will have already
been decided.

things out."

When asked about preparations
for the weekend meet, head coach
Frank D'Amico had three words to
say, “Routines, routines, routines."
He added, however, “If we take out
our unneccessary major breaks, I
feel we will have large success. We
had way too many this past week.”

Win BIG

“I guess we shouldn't look way
ahead before the match has even
started, but they will be forfeiting a
number of weights, and since our
heavyweight Curt Conner has been
injured, we'd prefer not to (have to)
subject him to such competition
unless it's absolutely necessary,”
explained Stottlemyer.

Despite a disappointing loss to
Cleveland State on Saturday after-
noon, Stottlemyer is not discour-
aged. “The team members learned a
very val_uable lesson from their loss.
They've been forced to accept that,
in order for them to win, each indi-
vidual must do his part. It's a total
team effort, and unless each member
contributes that which is expected of
(him), we won't be able to enjoy
team victories.

“The guys are still encouraged by
the season, however,” he continued.
“They're a young team and they've
been doing well. We're proud of
them and they should be proud of
themselves. Nonetheless, it wouldn't
hurt to see their hard work reﬂected
in the score."

Cocky? No, but a standard appli-
cation of psychology one employs
when faced with the prospects oflos-
ing the next two (and more?) games
against Top 20 material.

Back to Monday night for a
moment. “In the first half we played
with them," Watkins said, staying
clear of cursing St. John’s. “In the

‘second half we came out with a spurt

Pause.

“But at some point we played with
them and [the Redmen] saw that.
Somewhere in the back of their
mind. That might be the lesson to be
learned by the younger players.
They played a third-ranked team.
But they're just not playing a third-
ranked team, they have to show it.

Watkins, as a sixth man, fared OK
against St. John's with six points in

the starters. Keith Armstrong:

no rebounds in the first. Charles

INERESTED IN HAVING FUN & STAYING IN SHAPE??

It was the fall of 1978. I was a
freshman at North Catholic High
School. High school was a new
experience for me and an enjoyable
one at that. Iespecially enjoyed the
football games. Unfortunately, it
was the end of the season and we
were down to our ﬁnal game. North
Catholic usually closes out the sea-
son by playing rival Central
Catholic, and this year was no
different. -

When Friday night came, I was
excited about my first North-
Central game. It had been built up
like the Notre Dame-USC rivalry.
Both schools were (and still are) rich
in football tradition. We even have a
victory bell just for that one game.
Yes, just like in the movies.

But as I stood there in the stands,
something in my curiosity had yet to
be satisfied. Why had the quarter-
back for Central gotten so much
publicity? One local TV news station
even did.a feature on him the week of
the game. A mere few minutes into.
the game, I knew what the outcome
would be and why everyone fussed
over this quarterback. His name?
Dan Marino.

Surprisingly, we only lost by one
touchdown. But even if it had only
been by one point, something told

you that even at that tender age of
17, Marino was destined to win.
That is the mark of a true superstar.

In a day when everyone who
makes one big play on national TV is
deemed a superstar for life, Marino
shows the true definition ofthe word
every time he steps onto the playing
field. When Doug Flutie (who is a
good quarterback and will make it)
steps onto the field, you cheer for

him. Will he win? Won’t he win?‘

There's always that excitement in
the air. It is never over with Flutie.
With Marino, you expect him to
win. There is a common feeling that
nothing can stop him.

Think about it. It’s Saturday night
and Boston College just played this
afternoon. Youjust missed the news
and did not hear the score. You see a
friend walking down the street.
“Hey, how did Flutie do? Did he
win?” —
Now it’s Sunday night and you
missed the news again. Along comes
another friend down the street.

“Marino won, didn’t he? How many‘

touchdowns did he throw?”

If you are honest, you can proba-
bly recall asking both questions in
the exact same manner.

When Joe Louis fought, you I
asked in what round he knocked out

his opponent, not whether or not he

Thinking about last season, how-
ever, was not a luxury Mullin could

to the Olympic tryouts in Blooming-

him. “I think playing on that -team

I faced, I couldn‘t help but become a
better player.”

A better player. That is something
Mullin has never ceased to be. In
every year Mullin has improved. So
it came as no surprise, when earlier
this season Mullin found himselfin a
“slump,” that the press was wonder-
ing what happened to Mr. Auto-
matic. But Mullin was reluctant to
call his decreased scoring a slump. “I
wouldn’t really call it a slump. You

guys said it was," he said to the
assembled media in the locker room
after the Pitt game. “I can still put it
down whether people believe it or
not."

When you reach the upper strat-
osphere of American sports, as Mul-
lin has, there is an added dimension
to your life. You become a public
property. Everything you say and do
becomes instant news. Just ask Bill
Fralic what life up there is like. It
isn't easy, but it is not without its
rewards. In a few months Mullin will
sign a contract with some NBA team
for several million dollars. He will
never have to work a day in his life
outside giant sportsarenas.

But Mullin has grown accus-
tomed to the spotlight. He knows all
the right moves and he knows what
to say. Yet somehow it is hard to
believe it’s an act with Mullin. He
seems, well, too real, too much like
just another kid playing basketball
for any high school in America.
Maybe that is why Mullin is special
to so many fans. They readily iden-
tify with him. He is to the winter of
‘85 what Doug Flutie was to the fall

of ‘84. A real-life hero, an honest-to-
goodness “Aw, shucks!" role model.
Like very few athletes of Mullin‘s
stature, his record is unblemished. It
is fitting that 'Mullin still lives at
home. He is the son every mother
would like to have.

A group of small boys were
gathered a few feet away from their
hero after Monday's game. “Hey
Chris, this is Timmy,"someone said.
Timmy slowly advanced a few feet,
his eyes turned upward, looking out
from underneath a Steelers tossel

cap that was too big for him at the -

6-6 giant in the blue and red sweat
suit. A smile broke across Mullin‘s
face. “Hi, Timmy. You look like
you're all ready for the snow. Do
you like the snow? I do." Timmy’s
eyes were now as open as they prob-
ably ever would be, and he con-
tinued to stare at Mullin. “You want
an autograph?” Mullin asked, tak-
ing a program and a pen from the
boy’s hands. A few minutes later as
Timmy was led from the room, he
turned around. He was smiling now
and holding very tightly a program
that he will always keep.

That incident was vintage Mullin.
The heart ofa kid. And the talent of
one of the best collegiate basketball
players ever.

celebrating a win for the Lakers
without even watching the shot.

When Terry Bradshaw got his
hands on the ball in the fourth quar-
ter of Super Bowl XIV, you knew
there would be a celebration in the
Steel town that night.

It is company like this that
Marino is fast approaching. It is the
true superstars who are remembered
far beyond their years. Because of
their achievements, they retain their
youth and their memories never
grow old.

That reminds me of one of my
favorite movies, Francis Ford Cop-
pola’s “The Outsiders.” In this clas-
sic tale of teenage gang life, a poem
by Robert Frost found its way into
the story.

Ponyboy and Johnny were the
two youngest members of a tough
street gang. Dallas (fellow member)
was their “hero.” At one point in the
movie, Ponyboy told Johnny about
the only poem that Dallas ever liked
of all the ones that he learned about
in school.

It was called “Nothing Gold Can
Stay.” They never knew what it
meant, but they knew it meant some-
thing special.

Finally, near the end ofthe movie,
Johnny revealed the answer to Pon-
yboy in a letter.  I been thinkin’
about that poem and that guy who

sold... Boy

wrote it. He meant you’re gold when‘
you’re a kid, like green. When you're
a kid, everything’s new. Dawn. Like
the way you dig sunsets, Pony.
That's gold. Keep it that way, it’s a
good way to be ..."

Minutes later, the movie closed
with a song by Stevie Wonder called,
“Stay Gold." It was about finding
something good while you're young
and staying that way.

Stay gold, Dan Marino.
