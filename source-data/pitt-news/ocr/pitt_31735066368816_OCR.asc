Final vote next week

SGB Recommends Emergency F

By TOM KUKUCKA
and MIKE KANE

The Student Government Board
voted Wednesday to cut some
$5,800 from its own budget for the
purpose of distributing additional
funds-to ﬁnancially troubled WPGH

‘radio. V . *

This “represents a substantial
cut from the board’s budget,”
according to Josh Baylson, SGB
president, “and includes $1,000
from the/l5oard’s contingency fund
and $1,000 from the mailing fund,’
as wellas money from travel funds,‘
food service and "office wmainten-
ance. It represents a 21 percent cut
in the'board’s budget. -'

“We came up with some place we .

could squeeze money.fro_m,” said ‘
‘board member David Hesidence.

The SGB asked the allocations

A committee to consider the budget

cuts and submit a recommendation
at next Wenesday’s board.meeting..
‘ ‘Our option now is to wait untilit
(the ' request) comes out of
(allocation) committee and then
vote on it next week,” said board
member Stan Galanski. L
.Wednesday’s vote in tentative,

‘ and WPGH will not actuallyreceive ‘

the funds until another board vote

Jeff Couch, ‘station general

manager, suggested Wednesday 1

that letters he sent to other student
organizations requesting. that un-
used funds be returned. The board

‘decided to phone individual organ-

izations ‘instead.

The Pitt ‘Choral Group and the,‘

Campus Crusade. for Christ also

requested additional funding, but to
a much lesser extent.

“Although the actions of the

~ board did not definately give us the

funds" we need for the new

(carrier-current) system it was a

0 positive step in the right direction. ’ ’
said Couch. “The vote was a result \

of lobbying on our part and the
result of the support of some board
members, Stan Galanski in part-
icular.”

Galanski is a dis-jocky at WPGH.

WPGH shut itself off the air last
March because of defects discover-
ed in the carrier-current broadcast
system. ~ Although some repairs
were initiated this fall, Couch
decided more repairs and more
money were needed. .

-In other areas, the board passed a
resolution urging the University to

 divest its- interests in corporations .

with holdings in South Africa as a
protest of that country’s apartheid
government. ‘ . _

T he board_ was presented a
survey conducted by the National

 Council of Churches, which showed

that many corporations affiliated

_ with Pitt had investmentsin South

Africa. ,
“Pitt has 38 percent ' of its
investments in corporations in

 - South} Africa, ’ ’ . said. Bob» ‘Wagner, .
representing Pitt’s Anti-Imperialist.

Student Union. “We feel that
investments in South Africa aid the
South African government. ”

According to Wagner,_ 15 of 54
members of Pitts board of Trustees
are also members on corporation
Boards with holdings in South
Africa. ', . - '

mittee will try some hand-offs to
launch its voter registration cam-
paign at Pitt’s first home bout.
Students -waill, pass out Pitt-
Temple rosters advertising the
drive planned for next week.
Todd Park, PGRC chairman, said
registration booths will be set up in
the Student‘Union, Cathedral and
Towers dormitories September 27,
28 and 29. Members of the
Interfraternity Council and the
Resident Students Association will
man the booths.
Park also announced the appoint-

of Kevin McGune, a freshman _

from Chicago, as lobby coordinator
at PGRC’s Wednesday meeting. A
freshman was chosen because the
committee is “trying to build” a
foundation of expertise it can
expand in future years, Park said.

As at last week’s meeting, PGRC
ofﬁcers stressed that the goal of the

committee is to become involved-in '

community affairs. People’s
Oakland, a local group operating to
overcome obstacles in all.aspects of
community life, has offered to work
with the PGRC, said Tim Kearney,

-PGRC-public relations director. _ '

‘ ‘To work with the community we
must know ‘what the current

problems are. A tour of Oakland‘

(headed by People’s Oakland) will
indicate major points of conten-
tion,” he stated.

PGRC/People’s Oakland efforts
would be directed toward‘ crime
prevention, housing situations and
University-related conﬂicts that
Kearney said include community

resentment-over Pitt expansion and

current pressure to abolish the
Leisure Learn program. Leisure
Learn, a program People’s Oakland
supports, offers non-student Oak-
land residents an opportunity to
use University gym facilities
several hours a week. -
The state senatorial scholarships

were also discussed. The Senate.

Rules Committee voted Tuesday to
introduce a resolution to abolish
the scholarships. _ —

“We really don’t know what
standpoint we will take on this
issue,” declared Park. “It’s true
there is abuse of these scholarships
but then again, if they are
eliminated completely, that's so
much ‘more money students won’t
see.” 7 ~

Likewise, the PGRC does not
know what side it will lean toward
in the conﬂict over a proposed
$10.4 million state allocation to Pitt
for a research -center‘. _ Opponents of

Fire Breaks Ou’rOver Louisiana
Oil Reserve; Two Men lniured '  

By the Assoclaied,Presa
' HACKBERRY, La.—A 200-foot-
high pillar of ﬁre topped by a
column of smoke roared above a
294-million-gallon underground

reserve yesterday.
State _,police reported two men

-«. were burned and taken to a hospital
. in Lake Charles, La., about an hour
" away.

The ﬂames exploded at the ﬁrst of
the underground storage caverns
being filled with crude oil shipped in
from the Persian'Gulf, to be kept as

. an vergecy supply. _

“A workover rig was performing
a standard oil ﬁeld operation,
drilling a hole into the caver, when it
blew out and ignited,” said Bill

Parker, deputy project manager for’

the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

“We don't know what happened -

but it's an awesome sight.
We’ve got every trick in the book
working to try and control it.”

Parker said 7 million barrels of oil
were in the cavern under‘ pressure
of 650 pounds per square inch,
which was _forcing oil back up
through the well hole.

Oil well troubleshooters were
among those summoned to try to
blow out the towering ﬂames, and
then close the well hole, which
extends down 3,240 feet into the
roof of the .,

The cavern is in‘ an isolated
swamp area, about 20:iles south of
Lake Charles, La., with no
residentialsection involved. It sits

some 50 miles east of Beaumont, ‘

Texas, where an unrelated blowout
at a gas well drilling project forced
the evacuation ’of about 1,000
nearby residents Thursday.

Rea Wins Praise of
Testimonial Dinner

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s Board of Trustees, admini-
strators and faculty members
honored "retired trustees chairman
William H. Rea at a testimonial
dinner Wednesday night at Car-
negie Music Hall.

Rea, who retired last May after
serving 10 years as chairman,
received praise from representa-
tives of the board, the University
faculty, new board chairman Roger
S. . Albrandt and Chancellor
Posvar.

Rea, who once taught at
American University of Beirut,
Lebanon, in 1934, stopped teaching
because “he felt he didn’t have the
patience,” according to Posvar.
“Of course it takes no patience at all
to be chairman of the Board of
Trustees.”

f‘I have been deeply honored to
have been associated with William
Rea the past decade,” added
Posvar, who became chancellor one
year after Rea assumed the position’
of chairman. , I

Rea received’ the chancellor’s
medal, becoming only the seventh
person to receive the award.

— Albrandt presented a resolution

from the board thanking Rea for his

duties in the past. —
“Be it resolved,f’ the statement
reads, “that the members of the

Board ‘of Trustees express their

gratiﬁcation for all he has done for
the University.” _
Through his leadership,” - it
continues, ”...he is actively sup-
portive and strongly committeed to
the educational goals of the city of

Pittsburgh and the state.”

Rea, in accepting the chancellor’s
medal, had some praise of his own
for the city and Pitt ofﬁcials, saying
he felt most were pleased with the
fact he knew or recognized most of
the people at the dinner. A

“It's been frustrating, but it's
always been exciting and challeng-
ing in Pittsburgh,” Rea said. “It’s
been a fabulous experience. I think
the _second renaissance will be a
great at the first.

“What we see today at the
University is the tremendous
accomplishment of Wes (Posvar)
and his administration and
faculty,” he said.

Rea also praised faculty members
for remaining with University
during the “trauma years,”—the
mid ’60s—when'the University had
accumulated at $27-million debt by
1967 before receiving state aid.

“It was a really phenomenal
thing,” Rea said. .“T here would be
no’ University of Pittsburgh today if

you hadn’t stuck by use,” he told .

faculty members.

Rea also said he was pleased by
alumni response in recent years.

‘ ‘The alumni have gone to- work, ’ ’
he said. “This is absolute basic to
any institution. There isn’t any
university in the Untied States that
has shown the increase in annual
giving than we have the past five or
six years.

Rea, who will remain active as a
trustee, said he was conﬁdent in
Pitt’s future.

“I have been privileged to be on

the inside and see it all happen,” he .
said. .

NEW YORK (AP)—Americans
rating of Jimmy Carter’s per-

formance has rebounded sharply, ‘

rising 16 points in the afterglow of
the Camp David summit, a new
Associated Press-NBC New pool
shows.

But the surge, coming after

months of decline, has left virtually
untouched the public perception
that Carter is not doing such a good
job handling the nation’s economic
and energy problems.

This suggests the ballooning of
Carter’s overall rating after the
triumphant announcements of the
Camp David agreements could be a
fragile phenomenon unless the

president makes progress on other
issues, particularly domestic ones.

Forty-two percent of the public
rated Carter “excellent” or

' ‘ ‘good’ ’ for his overall performance

as president, the latest survey
found. That’s up from the 26
percent combined rating found in
an August AP-NBC News poll. _
Carter got “only fair” iratings
from45 percent of those inter-
viewed, down form 53 percent in
August. Twelve percent rated his
work “poor”, down from 20
percent last month. In both
months, 1 percent was undecided.
The jump puts Carter’s overall

 Skills at Special Pitt Classes

To many students, this is an
important function of the classes,
since they tend to speak their
native languages only in their
homes. ’

Role-playing is an important
aspect of the classes, giving the
students a practical learning
experience ‘they can enjoy. One
particular skit requires students to.
pretend to return an item to a

. department store for a refund. All

the students help each other,
pointing out mistakes and encour-
agingeach other. They use the
situation to discuss what difﬁcul-
ties would arise in such a case.

Supervisor for the classes is J ann
Huizenga, and the other instructors
who are all qualiﬁed in dealing with
English as a second language are
James Bernhardt, Laurie Cohen
and Barbara Klueber.

Dr. Howard Kleinman, spokes-
man for the Allegheny Inter-
mediate Unit stated that the
classes, which are sponsored by the
Pennsylvania Department of Edn-
cation are geared" to teach
functional English for survival in

the community.

This concept is working in thses H
_ English. classes

because there
exists a close tie among all the
international students—-—- the
English language. As Buniak puts
it, “We have to speak English in
class. That’s why it’s so helpful.”

West Bank evictions

Settlers Use Fists in Fight With Israeli Troops

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP)—Would-
be Jewish settlers used ﬁsts to ﬁght
Israeli troops who began to evict
them yesterday from an outpost set
up on the West Bank of the Jordan
River in defiance of the Camp David
accords.

A Defense Ministry spokesman
said soldiers had to carry ‘demon’-
strators one by one down the rocky
slopes to the road a mile away.

Israel radio said seven soldiers
and seven settlers were injured in
ﬁstﬁghts when the army moved in
on the unauthorized camp near the
Arab town of Nablus. Other settlers
barricaded themselves in huts, the
radio said. ' . I

“Our people will not go by
themselves,” said Zvi Slonim, a

spokesman for .the conservative
Gush Emunim movement. “Our
main bloc of 250 people is standing
together hand to hand.”

On Tuesday about 100 settlers
moved into the camp, but the
government ordered them out later
that day. Troops surrounded the
site, but more sympathizers slipped
into the settlement.

Slonim said three Parliament
members, Geula Cohen and Moshe
Shamir of the ruling Likud bloc and
Haim Druckman on the National
Religious Party, were at the camp.
The three say they are part of the
Gush Emunim movement, which
has no registered membership, but
are not settlers.

occupied the site to protest the
U.S.-mediated accord signed at the
White House yesterday by Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin
and President Anwar Sadat of
Egypt-

The settlers claim a God-given
right to settle anywhere in the West
Bank, the biblical land of Israel, and
fear a proposed Israeli evacuation of
Sinai settlements could set a
precedent for dismantling Israel’s
50 settlements in the West Bank.

The Israeli Parliament is to
decide on the evacuation of the Sinai
settlements within two weeks.
Egypt says it wil not sign a peace
treaty with Israel until the 20 Sinai
settlements are gone.

Defense Minister Ezer Weizman
and Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.

"live got Pabst Blue Ribbon an my mind.”

Raphael Eytan visited the West
Bank site Wednesday to ask the
group to leave voluntarily. On
Thursday Israel radio reported that
the settlers agreed to an offer. by
Eytan to move into a nearby army
camp, but Weizman vetoed the
deal. '

The government apparently
wanted to avoid a confrontation
similar to violent clashes between
the Gush Emunim and the Labor
government of former Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin three years
ago.

In 1975 Gush Emunim settlers
made eight attempts to settle at

. Sebastiye, also near Nablus, an area

heavily populated by Arabs. Seven
times troops tried to remove the
settlers. prompting Jew-against-

Jew clashes that traumatized the
nation.

The government ﬁnally allowed .. _
the settlers to move to the nearby“ .. " 

army camp at Kaddum.

5* Student Government Board’s Anti-Apartheid Resolution

v Prompted by the Anti-Imperialist Student Union,
the Student Government Board has passed a

I resolution urging the University to divest itself of

stock holdings in corporations that do business in
South Africa. In so doing, the SGB joins ranks with
the student governments of several other universities

- in advocating concrete measures designed to combat

the apartheid policies of the Pretoria Government.
The SGB’s resolution is not likely to have much ef-

fect on the administration here, however. Pitt, like

other universities faced with similar resolutions,
almost certainly will make no changes in its stock
portfolio for the sake of justice in South Africa.

Still, the SGB and the Anti-Imperialist Student

' Union are to be commended for the symbolic gesture

they have made.
Put simply, investment in South Africa is
profitable—largely at the expense of that country’s

‘black majority. The low wages, poor working con-

ditions and political repression imposed on South
Africa’s blacks (and, to a lesser extent, on its Asian
and “colored” minorities) are largely responsible for
the growth and strengthening of state capitalism in
that country. The political consequence has been the

-advancement of the racist Nationalist Party gover-
J nment

United States Steel, IBM, Exxon and other

‘ American multinational corporations with holdings

in South Africa may in fact, as they claim, provide

' both black and white workers with relatively good

wages and working conditions, at least when com-
pared to companies that are strictly South African

 held. But it must not be forgotten that investment in

American corporations operating in South Africa .

goes a long way toward strengthening the economic
position of the present government, and therefore
contributes directly to the continuation and expan-
sion of apartheid.

One of the most persistent arguments against
withdrawl of American investment has been the
claim that blacks would suffer the most from such an

V economic penalty. The fact that the Pretoria gover-

nment itself often argues along this line is an in-
dication that the polemic should be viewed with some
skepticism. i
It is, in fact, probably true that a decrease in or
withdrawl of American investment would~result in a
rise in unemployment among blacks, especially urban
blacks. But it also appears that many blacks, in par-
ticular those who work in the urban areas and are
forced to live in such unattractive places as Soweto,
are willing to pay the price. Speaking of the United
States’ foreign economic policy in an interview con-
ducted shortly before his death, Steven Biko, leader
of South Africa’s black consciousness movement,
said: “If Washington is really interested in con-
tributing to the development of a just society in
South Africa, it [will] discourage investment in South
Africa. We blacks are perfectly willing to suffer the
consequences.
fering.” V
-That a black South African could say such a thing

is a frightening indication of how bad conditions are '

in that country, and how hated the system of apar-
theid is among blacks. And Biko has not been the
only one to say it. .

We are quite accustomed to 'suf- V

There can be little question that black ‘rule will
eventually come to South Africa—historical
precedent and common sense provide evidence
enough of that. ‘The big question now is how the
transition will take place. More and more, it looks as

I if the transfer of power will be a violent and bloody

one, whether it comes as a result of domestic strife or
as. a consequence of cross-border intervention. But if
there is any chance, however small, that economic
pressure can help the ‘blacks and whites of South
Africa avert a violent confrontation, then those
measures are worth trying. It is in this sense that—no
matter how negligible its effect on actual University
policy—the SGB’s resolution is both eminently
justifiable and worthy of praise. ' J

With Jimmy Carter's recent
success in the Middle East peace
negotiations, he now may sit back

‘ and wait for the new public.-opinion

polls to be released. They most
likely will show a positive response
tothe Carter presidency. ' I A

people did not really feel he was

, earning his pay in the White House.

With the next presidential

, election two years away, journalists
and politicians have begun tossing

around names for the next election.
One name that was mentioned, for
the umpteenth time, was Mass-
achusetts Sen. Edward “Ted”

Kennedy. This time, however,
Kennedy did not remain in the back
ground when questions surround-
ing his candidacy were raised.
Instead, he called the president a
“poor leader?’ at the end of July,

and when he attacked Carter's,

National Health Plan in August,

pollsters started working on the.
people’s response. »

It was found that Americans

would choose Teddy over  if -‘

would overwhelmingly defeat

Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan,

7' ublican party chose to throw at
‘him. ' 5 ‘ ' '

What does Ted Kennedy have the
qualiﬁes him to be President? '

First, his name.

Americans have been in love with
the Kennedy family for half a
century now, and they will be voting
for John, Robertand Ted's sons in
future years on that qualiﬁcation
alone. There is a first family named

I am writing regarding the

dents. He encouraged spying on
student protest organizers during
the late 1960's on many of our
nation’s campuses. And, of course,
he was involved in the Watergate
scandal, in which he lied and plotted
against the American people.

By scheduling Ehrlichman’s lec-
ture, the PUPC is saying to everyone
around the University of Pittsburgh:
“We can learn from this man.” The
only thing anyone will learn from this
man is deceit and the art of
corruption.

I dislike, as I said above, using
student funds on a felon and helping
him to become rich from his criminal
activity. I also protest the using of
University property, supported by
my tax money, to be his podium.

I hope the PUPC will reconsider.

Commission Unaware of Castro Plots,

By the Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP)-—Former
President Gerald R. Ford conceded

yesterday the Warren Commission
was unaware of CIA plots to kill
Fidel Castro when it ruled out the
possibility of a conspiracy behind
President John F. Kennedy’s
assassination.

Ford agreed that with this

knowledge, the commission would -

have broadened the scope of its
investigation. But he voiced doubt
that a such an inquiry would have
changed the commission’s’ basic
conclusion that Kennedy was shot
to death by a lone assassin -- Lee
Harvey Oswald.

“Had the Warren Commission
known of assassination plots
directed against Castro, this might

have affected the extent of the

the House assassinations com-
mittee.
“It certainly would have required
the commission to_ extend its
inquiry into those operations,” he
added. “But I don’t think they, in
and of themselves, would have
changed the conclusions.
Ford, one of only three still-
living members of the panel setup
by Lyndon B. Johnson a week after
Kennedy’s. murder, also acknow-
ledged that he secretly briefed an
FBI official on the goings-on within
the commission. '
' But Ford insisted that only two
such contacts were made with
Cartha DeLoach’, a top aide‘ to
then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover,

Police Drop Extradition
Plans for Surratt

BEAVER, Pa.—Beaver County authorities said yesterday
they don't plan to seek extradition of Edward Surratt,

A convicted on rape charges in Florida, to face a murder

charge here. .

District Attorney Edward Tocci said it would be senseless
to bring Surratt back to Pennsylvania, where he is accused in
the shooting death of a steelworker, since he faces four life
sentences in Florida.

Surratt, a 36-year-old truck driver from Aliquippa, was

~ convicted in Deland,.Fla'., Wednesday on charges of raping

a woman and her daughter at gunpoint. _
He also has been charged in the January shooting death of

~ Baden, ’Pa., steelworker John Shelkons and the beating-of .
. Shelkons’ wife; the murder of a‘ 66-year-old West Columbia,
.S.C., man on June 1, and the beating death of a 70-year-old

House Votes to End Wiretap Ban

HARRISBURG (AP)——The House voted overwhelmingly
yesterday to end a 21-year ban on wiretaps in Pennsylvania.

Egged on by reports of increasing organized crime in the
state, the legislators agreed to allow district attorneys and
the attorney general to use electronic ‘eavesdropping
equipment with the approval of Superior Court. ’

The bill, approved 183-2, was sent to the Senate, where
similar legislation was passed earlier this week.

Prospects ‘for ﬁnal passage of the bill appear good, since _,

neither the House nor the Senate version differ radically.

If the wiretap bill is approved and signed by Gov. Shapp,
it would allow telephonewiretapping for the ﬁrst time since
1957. All eletronic bugging was outlawed by 1974
legislation. ‘ .-

Erie Official Calls  
For Cut in Program

By the Associated Press

ERIE, Pa.,—Erie County Ex-
ecutive Russell Robinson doesn’t
want to kill the goose, but
he said yesterday the county can do
without a few golden eggs in the
form of state and federal programs.

“I think it’s wrong to accept
every dollar available from Harris-
burg and Washington. We can’t
afford it,” he said.

Robinson, elected to his ﬁrst
political job last fall, said matching
fund requirements on a number of
state and federal programs simply
can’t be met by the county in 1979.

The county faces a $750,000
deficit in the '_ upcoming budget.
One way of trimming the shortfall
is to eliminate programs that
require matching funds _on the
county’s part, Robinson said.

“I would estimate we’d lose
about $4 million in state and
federal funding,” -he said in a
telephone interview. ’

The county has a budget this
year of $35 million. About $12
million is raised through local
taxes, most from a property tax of
15 mills. The rest comes from
other government sources.

“If left unchecked, weiwould
have a tax increase every year to
support our share of "these
programs,” Robinson said.

“We’re not only saying we can’t
afford to do it, but I think we have
the responsibility to say that with
Uncle Sam running anywhere
from a $40 billion to $80 billion
deﬁcit, he can’t afford it either.”

Most of the programs involve‘
human services, such as child
abuse, group homes for the
emotionally handicapped and drug
and alcohol abuse.

“We won’t turn down help for a
child that’s abused,” Robinson
said. “But government cannot bé

all things to all people and the best

government is the smallest.”

He said he had no clear idea of
how many people would be affected
if any programs are dropped. “We
will just have to draw the line as to
what is urgent and essentia .”

Robinson concedes that talking

-about fund cuts may be much

easier than doing so. For one
thing, some federal programs at
mandated.

“We’re studying that right now.
If we must haye a group home,
ﬁne. But I don’t know that we need
40 group homes,” he said.

His proposal has stirred up
opposition, which he ‘says comes
mainly from personnel involved or
volunteers who fear their program
will be cut." ' '

The Jordanian indecision makes
the attitudes of the Saudis even
more important. As custodians of
Isl’am’s holiest shrines they are
regarded as religious leaders in the
Arab world, and their oil riches and
huge aid programs give them
considerable sway over Jordan and
other poorer Arab states.

The objections the Saudis have
expressed to the Camp David plan
are the same as those voiced by
Jordan’s Ibrahim - that it does not
guarantee a total Israeli pullout

In the West Bank yesterday,

New Pope Voices Opinion on
Divorce to American Visitors

I By the Associated Press

VATICAN CITY, Pope John Paul
I, calling himself ‘ ‘just a beginner, ’ ’
took on the issue of divorce with a
group of American bishops yester-
day and urged taht saving troubled
marriages be given top priority.

‘ ‘In particular,‘-the indissolubility
of Chirstian marriage is important.
Although it is a diifficult part of our
message, we must proclaim it
faithfully as part of God’ s word, part
of the mystery of faith,” the pope
said.

In his first major address on an

.ethical issue since his election last

month, the pontiff said he intends to
follow the course of his predecessor,
Pope Paul VI. “His teaching is
ours,” he said.

Controversial issues-such as birth
control, abortion and priestly’
celibacy are ‘dividing the Roman
Catholic Church, but the pope’s

only specific reference in yester- .

day’s addresswas to marriage.
Ina throne room audience, I Pope

John Paul received nine bishops

from Oregon, Washington, Idaho,’

Montana and Alaska. They came
here with 45 other. American
bishops currently studying at the
Vatican.

Clad in brilliant white robes and a If ‘

white skullcap, t-he pontiff first read

an address in halting English,‘

participants said, then dismissed
his aides and said to the Americans,
“Now you ask me questions.”
“Pope‘Paul would never have
done that,” said Bishop Silvester
Treinen of Boise, Idaho.
Treinen said thepope told the

group “I can't speak English very‘
‘’ well” and that Bishop Anthony F.

lvlestic-v.-‘ 2-" .2.-:. Bronx, N.Y., acted as
an interpreter. ‘ s ‘

’ The Idaho bishop saidvthat when

one asked what should be done

when someone approaches a priest I

with a marital problem, the pontiff

replied: . - I 4
“Just be priests. Be more

pastoral and less administrative.”

This is a favorite theme of the
65-year-old former patriarch of
Venice, elected to the throne of
Peter without any Vatican admini-
strative or diplomatic experience.

The pope singled out for praise
“those, especially priests, who
work so generously and devotedly in
ecclesiastical tribunals, in fidelity to

the doctrine of the church, to
safeguard the marriage, bond, to_

give witness to its indissolubility in
accordance" with the teachings of
Christ, and to assist families in
need.” . 4

He said it wasthe church’s task to
support and defend families and
that ‘ "parents with special problems
are worthy of our particular pastoral
care, and all our love.”

At the conclusion of the audience,
the bishops shook hands -with the
pontiff and Bishop Robert Whelan
of Fairbanks, Ala., gave him a small
state of an Eskimo.

Nolte Film Best of the Vietnam Movies

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Who’ll Stop the Rain
Directed by Karel Reisz

If 1977 was the year of women’s
ﬁlms, then 1978 is the year _of the
Vietnam picture. The trend started

,with “Heroes,” starring Henry
’Winkler as the lovable but psychotic
vet, and continued with “Boys in
Company C, ” a standard war ﬂick.
The celebrated “Coming Home”
was a soap opera in disquise, with a

P relentless ’_60s score that blared as

persistently as the vintage '50s

  ﬂENTERTAlNMENT

radio beat of “American Grafﬁti. ”
“Who’ll Stop The Rain,” latest in
the line of Vietnam ﬁlms,is likely
the best of that genre.

Based on Robert Stone’s excel-
lent novel, “Dog Soldiers,”
(“Who’ll Stop the Rain” is lifted
from a popular Creedance Clear-
water Revival song of the early
'70s), “Who'll Stop the Rain” deals
with one of the issues of the;war that
Hollywood tends to glossiover in
favor of moral dilemmas. _

A war correspondent _ (Michael

_ Moriarty) is leaving Vietnam and-
wants to latch onto a quick bundle

by smuggling heroin into the states.
Too nervous to do it himself,
Moriarty enlists the aid of Hicks, a
Marine sergeant (Nick Nolte), to
carry the stash back home, where
Moriarty’s wife Marge (Tuesday
Weld), who just happens to be a
junkie, is waiting for the delivery..
But a team of what ﬁrst seems to
be government agents and later
turns out to be your average crew of
mercenary goons‘ learn about the
transaction and follow» Nolte into
San Francisco intendingto grab the
stash. Headed by Anthony Zerbe,

theylet Nolte and Weld know they

mean business and proceed to chase
the duo across the southwest.
Nolte, lacking the charm of his
“Rich Man, Poor Man” perfor-
mance, but easily topping his
laconic Redfordesque routine from
~“The Deep,” is good, not great, as
Hicks. But this is to his credit—he
does not outshine the story line or
the’ other performers. Nolte gives a
strong, but balanced characteriza-
tion. . .

Moriarty comes across rather the
same as he did as the Nazi in
“Holocaust”—nervous and

intense. His high, almost squeaky .
voice, which usually detracts from
his performances, is oddly '
appropriate here. ‘

Weld does her usual ﬂaky '

neurotic role, so good in “Play it as
it Lays” and “Looking For Mr.
Goodbar," but falls ﬂat here. Her’
childish vaperings - and cloying
cuteness get monotonous. “

Even apart from the current \ ,

Vietnam boom in movies, -“Who'll
Stop the Rain”is the only ﬁlm "of.
this sort, sofar, that can stand on its
own. “

  'Sgt.Pepper' Should be Biistedto Private 

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer

r_ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club

Movie Case P
RSO Records

If youenjoythe Beatles for their
meaningful songs, you’ll hate the
soundtrack from the "movie “Sgt.

A _ Pepper’s Lonely Hearts -Club

Band.“ ' y

The album is overly-commercial-
ized sagcharin, turning the Beatles’
message-to-the-people style into
sellable, teenybopper-pleasing
dance tunes. ,

The only ones who come out
smelling like roses are Aerosmith,
Earth, Wind and -Fire and Sandy
Aerosmith’s only cut-
“Come Together”——is in the same
hard rock style used by the Beatles,
Vbutiwith more guitar that ﬁts into
the song. ‘ 1

   

Earth, Wind and Fire do a jazzy
justice to “Got to Get You Into My
Life,” upbeating the then-rol1ick-
ing John Lennon-Paul McCartney
hit. - .

Farina’s voice is pretty on

“Strawberry Fields Forever,” but" '

she sings it as a love ballad. The,
Beatles never intended it for that

' purpose. ‘

Others: don’t escape abomina-

- tion, however. Alice _Cooper_ruins _

“Because,”- using chant instead of
singing; Frankie Howerd and his
androidsp turn “Mean Mr. Mus-
tard” into a circus; Dianne
Steinberg’s voice is pitifully thin on
“.You Never Give Me Your
Money;” George Burns scratches

his raspy was through “Fixing A ,

Hole;_” and Steve Martin and Bllly
Preston use their styles to do little
for “Maxwell’s ‘ Silver Hammer”
and “Get Back,” respectively:

And then there are the stars of

the whole ‘show, Peter Frampton.’
The four_

and The BeeGees.
musicians collaborate to ruin more
songs than they popularize.

At times, one of the four tries to
fancy-up a song, destroying the
original meaning; Frampton uses
voice trills and ﬂuctuations to try to
make “With a Little Help From My
Friends,” and “She Came Through
The Bathroom Window” ’ cute.
Robin-Gibb does the same to “Oh!

creating a thicklv sweet atmos-
phere about the song. it (wasn't
belong.

What songs the BeeGees do V

straight are also disasters because
the arrangements don’t take the

Beatles’ ‘original meanings into '

zonsideratipn; - “Getting (Better, ’ ’

‘-‘She’s Leaving Home,” and the
title. cut are awful.

Only two of the songs by The
Be'eGees are worth hearing. The
group adds the, right amount of
carnival atmosphere to “Being for
the Beneﬁt. of Mr. Kite” and does

I well to ‘capture all the meaning in
an updated “A Day in the Life.” “ '

But other than that, none of the

. meaning the Beatles put into their P
* songs appears in this purely’
commercial version. Beatles fans i '

should buy the album just to break?

  Mark Schubert Spurred
  By Acidic Sports Story 

ByMARlASCIULLO
Pm News Staff Writer .

The Pitt News maynot realize
it, but one of its writers has helped
to make Mark Schubert a better
kicker.

Actually, according to Schubert,
something written in-_the paper.
alongthe lines of ‘ ‘Pitt doesn't have
a kicker"-made him decide to work
all the harder.

The junior place-kicker from
Springdale said he felt fortunate to
have so many others helping him
with his game, including Scott
Jenner and head coach Jackie
Sherrill. 

“A kicker is only as good as the
holder,” he emphasized. “When
I'm out there Scott has about 1.2
seconds, to set the football up for
me, and I'm lucky to have someone

_ as good as Scott up there, not to

mention Walt Brown (the Pitt
center).

“Walt is probably the best
snapper in the country,” Schubert
said. “He takes a personal interest
in his snaps and will ask if
everything went OK. In a spot in
which kicking is one-third of the
game, Walt’s one-third of each
kic .”

Last Saturday, when the Panthers
were in a last-second drive for the
goaline, Sherrill opted to try for the
touchdown rather than a field goal.
Schubert felt the same way.

“If we can score a touchdown,

P ﬁne,,I would rather see that,” he

said. "“Coach Sherrill knows what
he's. ,doing, and I'll support

anything he decides. If we are in a

possible kicking situation on the

‘field, he'll ask me, ‘Do you think

.1

you can make it?’ If] really believe I
can, I'll say so, but sometimes I
know Dave Trout would be more
capable, or maybe the angle’s not
right yet, so I have to be honest.”
This year, the NCAA has some
new ﬁeld goal rules. Missed
attempts will be returned to the line
of scrimmage this year, rather then
placing the ball on the 20-yard line.
Long attempts therefore become

PM News Statl Writer

The best water polo team in
Canada will be there; the No. 6 team
in the United States will be there,
and of course, Pitt's old nemesis,
Bucknell will be there. "There” is
the Fourth Annual Pitt Invitational
at Trees pool this weekend.

The Panthers and their new
coach, Jay Fisette, will be looking to
regain the championship that has
.eluded them the last twoyears.

The tournament is a’ round-robin
affair with  playing the,
other three teainsin its bracket.‘

Following this preliminary. round.

Ham's Axed

Larry Harris, who last season
became Pitt's leading career
basketball scorer, was included
in the first group of players
released by the NBA’s San
_Diego Clippers at their presea-
. son camp.
I Harris, a 6-foot-6 shooting
forward who led Pitt in
scoring the past three seasons,
had been chosen during the
fourth round of the NBA draft
by the Buffalo Braves, who
later movedto San Diego and
were renamed.

somewhat riskier. The Panthers’
strong . defense, Schubert noted,
will make things easier for the
kickers, despite the new rule.

“I think the opposition could be
much more highly motivated after a
missed‘ attempt—they’d feel they
got a lucky break with better ﬁeld
position—but we (the Pitt kickers)
are the lucky ones. Often we're
ahead in the game because of our

‘big-play offense, and, of course, our
defense is just so strong they can
take care of the situation if
something should go wrong.”

Kicking is a lonely part of the
game. You have to like being by
yourself, but according to Schubert,
maybe it just appears that way.

‘ ‘When I'm out there on the ﬁeld,
I'm certainly not thinking about
myself like, ‘Hey, nine or 10 points
out there today would make me look 2.
good, ” he said. Ikick for the team, I =1‘

works so hard and, of course, I'm V  _

pressure because it's not really I

‘ ‘What I mean is, I'm responsible

else’s, because I should be able to
kick no matter what. I do my best
and if I succeed, then that’s the way
it's supposed to be. But if I don’t
succeed, Iknow there is a reason for
it. Whatever happens, happens.’

It's all in His hands and while this

probably seems like a lackadaisical ‘

attitude, I'm saying I don't feel the
pressure because I just do the best I
can.”

As a- defensive-offensive tackle in

high school, Schubert learned about

series of injuries, including a
concussion, torn knee cartilage and
stitches over one eye. Sports has
not always meant success.

receives from Schubert, a psycho-

better kicker,” he said. “I use if
kicking to bring me closer to Him.
In anything you do inlife, that’s how
it is. . " ‘

“Football and macho go togeth-
er, and I guess being a Christian
isn’t a macho thing. But then again,
neither is kicking,” he joked.

Mark Schubert and-holder Scott Jenrier work well together.

“To me, the scariest thing about 2‘

football is to be overconﬁdent,” he

added. “You just can't put yourself ‘

above anybody, and that’s how it is
in everyday life, too."

Zaring Daring Enough to Attempt Comeback .    *

_By ANNA ARLOTTA

Making a comeback on the sports
ﬁeld is a tough job for any athlete
to undertake. Pitt soccer has such
an athlete in senior striker Jedd
Zaring.

When coming to Pitt four years
ago from Wilson High School in
Reading, PA, Zaring was looked
upon as one of the top candidates
for Panther soccer. He became the
starting fullback and lettered his
ﬁrst year.

Zaring played his entire sopho-
more season with a torn cartilage in
his . knee, hampering his play

"soccer that year the cartilage tore
completely, and an operation was
performed.

Zaring came back his junior year

  Pantherette Volleyball Hopes to Cash in an Interest

By JEFF DUROSKO
Volleyball is one of the fastest-
growing sports in the United States.
There is a professional league, and
Olympic team interest rapidly is
increasing.
Pitt’s women’s volleyball team
hopes to cash in on this interest this
season, when it opens tomorrow
‘with a match at West Virginia.
Pitt has placed fourth in the East
for the past two years and hopes to
qualify for the national champion-

According to head coach Mike

Hebert, the women had “a

as a starting striker. After scoring
two goals in four games, the
cartilage was torn again, and
midway through the season Zaring
decided to quit and give the knee a
rest. -

“After two years of problems I
didn’t think I would ever be able to

play again,” said Zaring. “I had
lost my speed, which is so
important to a wing,” added

Zaring, “and I lost a lot of
conﬁdence due to the fact I hadn’t
played much.”

This summer Zaring decided to
get back into shape and give Pitt
soccer another try in his senior
year!’

“I made a decision to come back,
although I wasn’t really sure I
could play,” said Zaring. “In June
I started training,” he said. “I got

This training paid off for Zaring,
and he has seen a lot of playing
time for the Panthers this season.
The striker situation is run so all
the wings are getting equal playing
time.

Zaring has shown improvement,
as he came within inches of scoring
a goal against ‘Mexico in the

scoreless home opener. In the

Panthers 4-0 win over Bethany,
Zaring was credited with a goal.

“Scoring against Bethany picked
up my conﬁdence a great dea ,”
said Zaring.‘ “Now I know I can
score, and I’m going t/o.”

While some had a good summer,
the team is not without its
problems. Injuries are Herbert’s
big worry, as six of the nine women
are injured or coming off injuries.
He particularly is concerned with
the health of Maria Perez. Last
season she was redshirted because
of knee problems.

“Knowing that Greg can’t play
will make each of us concentrate
more on what we've got to do to win,
and that will make us a better

I came to Pitt,” said Zaring. “In
fact, I think this will be the best
team since’ Pitt went. to the NCAA
palyoffs in 1962. With a little luck
and some growth in fan support I
believe we can get a bid to the
NCAA playoffs.”

Zaring believes Pitt soccer is at
turning point.

“I think Pitt can be considered to
play the best soccer in Western
Pennsylvania,” he said.. “The

thing we’ve got to do is make Pitt ’

students realize there is a varsity
sport on campus called soccer.
Working toward this exposure,”
said Zaring, “is as important to me
as playing the game itself.”

Hebert. “A lot of our success
depends on her health.”

The only other problem Hebert
notes is his team's lack of

conﬁdence, which has hurt in past

years.

‘ ‘I think we’re past that stage now,

but we’re really behind in
preparation due ‘to the injuries,”
he said. “I think that we’ll get off to

offense and defense that we’re
using.”

same calm, relaxed attitude he had
in the ﬁrst three games.

“The same things we did we’re

$00 vill Joins Nit Club

By the Associated Press '
STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—When
Brad Scovill opened the game at
tight end for Penn State last week,
he joined a select club of Nittany
Lions—the walk-on starters. ‘
The chances of a walk-on starting
for a Penn State football team are
about as good as those of an
earthquake striking Philadelphia.
But coach Joe Patemo has had a
few of note—Neal Smith, who
played defensive back on two
unbeaten Nittany Lions’ squads
(1968, 1969), and Ron Coder an
offensive lineman in 1974 and 1975.
Tom Bradley, leader of this year’s
special teams, was a walk-on for
three seasons. He received a
scholarship this year. ’

2 There may have been others, but

the memory of Penn State Sports 

Information Director John Morris
can’t produce any more in the
Paterno regime.

 On his ﬁrst move against Ohio A
‘State last Saturday,

Scovill, .a
199-pound sophomore, jumped
offside. But after that, the 6-foot, 3
1/2-inch tight end from
Wyomissing, Pa., did a ﬁne job.

. Scovill caught two passes for a
total 22 yards. One was a 13-yarder
that produced a ﬁrst down in a drive
that led to one of Matt Bahr’s four

" ﬁeld goals. It was early in the fourth

period and gave the Lions a. 16-0
lead. I
