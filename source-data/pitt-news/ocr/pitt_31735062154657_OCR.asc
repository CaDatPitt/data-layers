Gentlemen:

Replying. to your circular letter of
June 29, be informed that your sample
packages were. received. With them

received the pamphlet describing
your product, which. I was able to
enjoy-‘reading because there was not
in the circular matter the usual die-
tasteful sales talk which makeslthe

obligated ‘or uncomfortable.‘ .
I believe your practice: of "giving -

your prospect a. sum le and then

etting_him make up is own mind
will gain you many more customers
than will the usual modern sales prac-
tice of pushing the product down the
prospect’s throat. As a matter of fact,
since receiving your sample and your‘
advertising matter {I smokedup the
_sample'package' and have since"pu'r-
chased a number of ' cans. from ne1gh—.-
