The trouble with early morning classes is that you’re too sleepy.
At late morning classes you’re too hungry. Atlearly afternoon

If you’re always too hungry or too sleepy for class, then let’s
hold classes when you’re not too hungry dr sleepy: namely, when
you’re eating or sleeping. _ '

,Classes while eating are a simple matter. Just have a lecturer
lecture while the eaters eat. But watch out for noisy food. I
mean who can hear a lecturer lecture when everybody is crunch

contain your ecstacy, lest you disturb the lecturing lecturer. '

Review of “Youngblood Hawke’

“‘“ New Herman Wouk Novel

Called T rite,But Interesting

By JAMES O’BRIEN

Herman Wouk has reincarnated
Thomas Wolfe in “Youngblood
Hawke” (Doubleday, $7.95) and
buries him countless times in his
733-page searching inquiry into
the agonizing problems of author-
4’ ship (taxes, how to ge the highest

bid for movie rights, etc.)

Wouk dismembered Wolfe and
used the pieces to put together his
novel’s author-hero. He arrives in
New York from Hovey in Letch-
worth County, Kentucky. Wouk
leads you to think ‘that Hawke’s
happy teeth are ﬁlled with hominy
grits, but the corn soon falls off
the-cob. , '

The publishers at Prince House
J had_never seen a larger or more
untidy manuscript '— or for that
matter, a larger and more untidy
author.‘But he claimed the bosses
in much the same way, as Dizzy
Dean probably wooed the radio
broadcasting industry.

ExuberancelPays_ Off

“Well, you are an exuberant
writer,” the publisher says. “I’m
reminded of Dickens, of Dreiser,
perhaps a bit of Dostoyevsky.”

“You’ve nailed “me,” Hawke

for success. He would make a mil-
lion dollars, and he would write
the great American novel.

Five years later, with ‘two
best sellers and a Pulitzer Prize
to his credit, it seemed as if
nothing could check his amazing -
career — if he would only stop
crawling in the wrong bed at
night.

One patron of the arts, a 40-
year-old lover‘ named Frieda Win-
ter bought him an $800 a month
apartment’ in The Park Tower.
“Did you want to make love to me
in-your loft,” she tells him, “under
your hanging wet socks?”

Loves Another ‘_

The girl he really loves, how-
ever, is a beautifuleditor named
Jeanie Green, who, by day, pen-
cils the superfluous from Hawke’s
chapters, and by night, she is his
lady love. Not all night, of course;
Wouk heroines are good girls.

She‘ substitutes for Wolfe's
priceless editor, Maxwell. Per--V
kins (remember -the. guy that
Jeff Chandler played in Return.
to Peyton Place?).

To ensure making a, million

Management,

an abortion on Thomas Wolfe.
The gross offense of distorting a
man’s life can be justiﬁed to some
extent if it helps the novelist to
capture the-quality of a man’s
spirit, but there is no literary or
historical justiﬁcation forrthe cy-
nical trespass Herman Wouk com- . ~
mitted in Youngblood Hawke.

 To Hear‘

Featured speaker at the Wed-
nesday meeting of the University

By Matthew Nesvisky

ination at the University which.

,, ‘appears on this page refers to
 ' an incident commented upon in

an editorial here a few weeks

 ago. It is the second written ex-

pression of student opinion on

A ~ the subject which has been pub-

lished in The Pitt News. The
first was drawn up by the pres-
ident and vice-president of Stu-
dent Government who “looked
into the matter” and concluded
that “the matter
dropped” as the moral backyard

~0lf the University “is in order.”

The two students who sent to-
day’s letter, however, assert
thatpafter conducting their own
investigations, “Pitt's back yard
is still as full of humbuggery
and hypocrisy as it ever‘ was.”
"Anyone may have his opinion
published in the newspaper, but
these letter-writers, in addition
to numerous students and non-
students who have voiced com-
mentary on the incident, seem
to have been misled by one

should be '

common misconception: that the.

University eondones a policy of
racial discrimination. This is, of
course, untrue and was not in
any way meant to be implied
in the editorial of October '10.
The University administration
has clearly stated its stand on
the issue on. several occasions,
one of the most recent being last

‘year when a Negro newspaper

questioned the school’s racial

» _policies‘ in its athletic program.

In addition,, after being contact-
ed by The Pitt News about the
incident concerning the African
student, Dr. Alan C. Rankin, As-
sistant Chancellor for Student

 

     

 

The  

and General Affairs, said the stu-
dent has completely misinter-
preted the action involving the
c'ase. '

But rumor, suspicion and
further reports of other discrim-
inatory-happenings on campus
still abound. "Other incidents
were mentioned in the Editorial
of October 10. Another is men-
tioned in the letter appearing
in today’s issue. Other students
have privately presented a num-
ber "of additional cases. I

None of the "actions reported
is publicly condoned by any
level of the University. But this
does not mean that problems of
such a nature -should be‘sup—
pressed without the opportunity
for all voices to be heard.

Prejudice is difficult to de-
ﬁne, diflicult to deal with, difﬁ-'
cult, at times, ‘to recognize. Dis-
crimination is the outward, phy-
sical expression. of prejudicial
thinking. Such action often
causes discomfort or pain for
discrimination‘s targets., ,

Some student.s here have rea-
son to believe they are being
discriminated against or have
witness such action taken
against fellow students. It is felt
that it would be most harmful
to adhere to the advice that such
matters “should be dropped.”
,Ending prejudice "is a long battle,
but stopping discrimination can
occur if incidents are reported
and discussed openly. Making
public all reports and opinions
either to this newspaper, ‘Stu-

dent Government or the Uni-
versity ofﬁcials is fully en-
couraged. ’

Mother: “For once, I think 'you’re right. What
I’m going to do now is turn this thing off and go
. to bed.” ' ‘

I see by the recent perusal of certain aged
articles in divers newspapers thatgonei of the many
positive attributes shared by the chancellor of the
University and myself is the eschewal oftelevision.

Now I have no doubt, of

course, that the chancellor is one
of those last-of-the-race Faulk-

nerian types who has purposely

bought a television’ set in order

to stalk past its blank face at

eventide, triumphantly scorning

a menage of intellectual pablum

he is strong enough to resist.

But since I am-of weaker

- stuff than the chancellor, I‘ am
forced to do my television spurn-
ing by the adoptionof the simple
expedient of not owning‘ one. And this is asyit
must be, since I, lapserian ‘creature that I am, have
my snobbish disdain ripped into pathetic shreds
each time the grey’ eye stares ﬁxedly into mine.
For example, wheneve-r I go to visit my aged
mother (who does own one -of these ingenious
machines) I cannot take my leave at about nine"
o’c1ock without the transpiring of a scene similar
to that following: '
Myself (catching sight of the ﬂickering screen):
“Just what is this brainless scene we have before
us, anyway?”
V Mother: “Well, that man in the white suit is a
young and inexperienced doctor, don’t you see, and
he is about to do a delicate trepanning operation
upon that elderly geezer, who is, by the way, the
young _doctor’s father. Only the young . . .” ' .
’ Myself (lip a-curl .in a. monumental sneer):
Phaugh, what puerile

“Doctor doesn’t know it.

Myself (my eyes all aglaze by now): “Hold.
Let’s just see ‘how this tomfoolery will turn out.’.’

The trap, friends, has slammed shut, and will
not open again until two a.m., when the rocket-,
trimmed din of the National Anthem proclaims the
arrival of a" few hours of sputtering fuzz and the
end of another broadcasting day. Stiﬁeyed, I t-u/rn_

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Back Yard Hypocrisy
Criticised by‘ Students’

Editor, The Pitt News
Pitt’s back yard is still as full

of humbuggery and hypocrisy as w

it ever was, and Judy Die-
thorn’s letter representing the
studentbody, Student Govern-
ment, or whomever she was
trying to represent,’contributed
nothing to The Pitt News efforts
to clean house. ' ’

A policy of interference with,"

the personal relationships of
“Pitt Women” and foreign stu-
dents .is a little-discussed’ but
very important part of the “so-
cial regulations” carried out by
the Dean of Women. We first
saw evidence of this fact when
a young woman of our acquaint-

ance was told by ‘her head resi- '

'dent that she shouldn’t eat in the
cafeteria with the African stu-
dents because “it didn’t look
good.”

It was soon thereafter that
their campaign against the
“white girl student” in question
was begun.‘They telephoned the
room-mate of the girl and told
her to drop hints to the “white
girl student” that she ought to
go to the school psychiatrist.

Later, because the room-
mate refused to be a party to
such action, the suggestion was
made more directly. What fol-
lowed was related precisely in
the editorial. _

The actions taken by the “Af-
rican” after the removal of the
girl from school are asfollows,

in his own, words‘: “I’ve been

one was scared to discuss this
thing with me. d

“When I came in, they turned
their heads and stared at the
tops of their desks while they

,talked with me. There's a .black

cloud hanging over the Univer-
sity, and everybody’_s scared of
it.

after her letter was in the pa-
per. She said she’d made a
thorough investigation, but she
didn’t talk tome, to the gi'rl,:or

even to the Dean'of Women.
-She only talked to Asst. Chan-

cellor Rankin. _ _
“They brought us to "America

to learn American. democracy.‘

I wouldn’t_ object sovirriuch if
they had‘ called me up and spo-
ken to me personally. But all
they did wassneak around be-
hind locked doors.”

Overand‘ over be emphasized‘

that his major _’complaint was
with the ‘handling of themat-
ter. He feels that it was a ser-
ious affront to, him >_ that all
measures of the Dean‘ of Wom-
en's oﬁiee were indirect ones
toward th
that nobody at any time con-
fronted him face-to-face.

Is this any’ kind of example
of‘ the open, honest, American
way of handling matters? As our
friend commented bitterly, ‘.‘Yes,
I’ve seen American democracy
at work.”

We have been warned by
many that we incur. retaliation
from above for this type, of ex-
posure of the facts, but it must
be*made. Would this sort of
thing‘ happen at the-
ones‘ near the top

dent declared, “In, Europe, such

However, the_ students felt we

’m All Right,  Mother

 Janie Stokes kept the Cadillac at an even seventy when
Cher mother wasn’t looking at the speedometer. The two
nijjlolclock sun had hogged both lanes of the Pennsylvania
Turnpike for the last two hours.
 “God, it’s hot,” Janie said, opening" her side window as
. jgfarhasn it would go. {
‘W ‘ A‘ ''.‘‘Must be eighty,” her mother said. ’ . ”
. “Eighty? It’s gotta be at least a hundred-thirty.
'. “Want to put the top down?” I
y _ ‘-‘No, it’s worse. Mother, I still don_’t see why ‘we had
to leave today.” ' v V .
 _ . “Keep your eyes on the road, Janie.” .
“They are. Why couldn’t we leave tomorrow like every
“other freshman in the world?”
 “We’ve been all overtthat,” Mrs. Stokes said, her nose
.*wr'inkling up the way it did when she was, upset. “,I just
ouldn’t sleep nights knowing things weren’t Just so.

“Mother, you read in the universityycataloguethat all
the rooms are the same; all clean, all big. What do you ex-
xpect-_—-air conditioning and wall to wall carpeting?”

“You mean the rooms aren't air conditioned?”
, “Mother!”
“Well, Janie, how ,will you ever take the heatl?”

Janie pushed the car to seventy-five. “You’re

right, Mother. Absolutely. I’ll probably go crazy.
I’ll probably do something drastic like open a
window!”

“Now stop being nasty, Janie, and slow down.
You’re doing’ eighty.”

“I am not.”

“You” are.”

“I am not. It only looks like that from your
side. I just don’t understand it, mother.”
“What?” ~

“What could possibly go wrong today that
wouldn’t go wrong tomorrow?” A

“Plenty, Janie. First of all, there’s your room-
mate.” , I

“Ma, my roommate won’t even be there today.”

“Tha_t’s just the point, Janie. Honestly, you can
be so naive sometimes. We’ll get there before she
comes and gets the good drawers.”

“I don’t believe you said that, Mother.”

“Janie, dear, your mother knows best. No girl

from a hicktown in. Pennsylvania is going to steal '

my child’s closet space.” /
“God, I don’t believe you said that. “There are
two closets, Mother, and‘ Harrisburg happens to
be the capital of Pennsylvania.”
“Janie, .I' don’t care if it’s the capital of the’
world. I'don’t trust this girl.”
“Ma, we’ve' never met her.” _.
“Wel‘l,'who ever heard of Harristown or what-

ever it is? No dear, -I know what I’m talking’

about . . .” .
“All right, Mother. Just leave me alone. There's
another tunnel.” '
“Put on your lights, dear.”

Theyarrived at the University‘ at -four o’clock.
They spent the‘ rest _of the 'day unpacking. Mrs.
Stokes seemed satisfied with the room, "small as it
was, and quick1y‘f:i1led the top’bureau with Janie’s
sweaters and underwear. ‘ ;

Janie wondered {what Johnson, Barbara, L.,
Harrisburg,. Pennsylvania, »would say -if she were
there watching her mother steal ‘another~ drawer
for a’ single cashmere sweater. It_'didn’t. matter
though, she would ré-arrange the drawers as soon
as her mother left.‘ _ ,

As soon as her mother left.

“Mother,” Janie’ asked, “When are ‘you leav-_

ing?” .

What kind of a question was that? Mrs. Stokes
wouldn’t think of leaving without taking "her little‘
girlifor a ,“last supper.” Did Janie get it? A “last
supper?”

The joke, was ‘properly received, as was the
dinner, and Janie now stood by the car saying her‘
last good—bye. __

“Well, dear, I guess this is it,” Mrs. Stokes said
as if she were going to die in the next half-hour
or be seriously injured at least. Her nose started
wrinkling the way it did. ‘‘You’ll be all right, won’t
you?” - '

“Of course, Mom. Thanks for everything.”

\

 

 

 

“Don’t be silly dear. What are mothers for?
Especially when her baby is going to be gone
for so long. Remember what I told you, dear. Any
trouble, call right away. I’ll come right down and
get you. And you have the bank account?”

“Yes, Mom, everything. Will you tell Daddy
good—bye for me?” ,

“Yes; Janie. How often ‘will you— write?”

“As much as I can, Mother. You won’t forget
to tell Daddy.”

“I won’t, dear.” She started to talk slower and
Janie knew a scene would be coming if she didn’t
get going. Mrs. Stokes had played Lady Macbeth
in college.

“Oh, my baby,” she cried, the tears picking
up speed as they rolled past her rouged cheeks.

“Now, Mother, get going./I’ll be fine,” _Janie
comforted. “I’ll miss you, Mother-.” ‘

The words- seemed to cheer Mrs. Stokes up a
bit. She started the car. “I love you, baby,” she
said, her nose twitching simultaneously with the
beat of the motor.

“Good—bye,” Janie said.

“Good-bye,” the car -echoed, as‘ it pulled out of
the quadrangle. ~ A

Janie sighedithe sigh of the relieved and walk-

- ed back to her room. It was still hot,'even with the

sun down, and she decided- to ‘take a bath. ‘She
looked in the drawer for her itowels. She found
them.in the bottom of the bureau; her mother had
even moved in there. Janie shook her head a little.
She'd have to remember to re-arrange the drawers
before her roommate came. If she ever knewlv

“Hello," Janie said softly, trying her best to

sound the way she. had practiced; the way she

‘would talk allthe time from now on.

“John McGackin. You don’t know me. I saw

“I-ley, yousound as swinging as you look,” John

McGackin said. “The reason I called was, I ﬁgured ’

5 shouting “Hello.” John kept saying “How ya do-
? ing? How’s it going?” as he led Janie to a booth‘.
to their table almost
immediately. She had long dark hair that stuck to-
gether about her face the way the peel of a ban-
ana folds about its fruit. “Hi, love,” she said,

looking at John as she slid a basket of potato
chips on the table.

A waitness came over

 “Hi, Angie,” John said, reaching for one that
was so limp ‘it looked like a leaf.

“What’ll you have?” Angie asked, her ‘back
turned to Janie.

“Iron City.”

"And you?” Angie asked Janie, without turning

her body so she had to strain her neck to ask the '

question.

. Janie was prepared. She remembered the beer

her father drank when he came home from the
~. ,course. “Miller’s please.”

“Miller’s? What’s with thischick?” Angie asked
.John, winkinggat him like they had known each
other all their lives.
“Hey doll,”»John said, putting his arm around
Janie, “have Iron City.”
,“Okay _with me,” Janie said, wondering what.
the hell Iron City was. ‘
_ “That’s my girl,” John said squeezing ‘her a
little.
bdi Angie -spoke suddenly. “Hey,

sis, you got an age card?”

What the hell is- this age crap,
Angie,” John said. “Just get the
beers.” V

Angie gave Janie a dirty look,
but Janie returned it.

“What does she think I am,”
Janie asked, “a child?” _

“Hey, babefyou swing,” John
said and‘ moved closer. “You
. really swing,” he repeated.

 3;; Janie smiled at him. That’s
ti, ' , all it took, she thought. It’s that
' easy-_  V .
Her eyes were beginning to
get accustomed to the darkness
and she "looked. -around. There
was a bar in the center of the
room and booths placed all
along the ‘back. The place was
pretty empty. Only one other booth was taken by a
group of ki~d’s Janie-’s age. At the bar, three boys
were standing drinking beer from bottles. A wom-
an, at least fifty, was sitting witha man. She was
fat and her body drooped over the side of the
bar" stool. She was talking in a loud voice and
she kept call_ing the man “Charlie Boy.” Janie
wondereddwhat a woman like that was doinglin
a place like this. She started to’ realize that she
never really knew what type of people came into
these places. Well, she was going to know from
—_» now on.‘ That was for sure. I
S “Drink up,” John said when the beers came,
taking a swallow as if he hadn’t drunk anything
for a week. “Hey,” he said, “some of the fella_s
are going to meet us here about _ten. You’ll like
‘A them.” , t I
Janie smiled. Of course she’ll like them. ‘And
theylll like her. They’ll love her. Things would
be diﬁerent from now on.
 She took her beer and swallowed a hard gulp.
,-4, It tasted funny," like the time ‘she swallowed salt
water by mistake, but she kept on drinking. No-
thing was going to stop- her.any more. She was
going to make up for all the fun she had missed.
She laughed suddenly ,not knowing why, and
moved closer‘ to John. ‘
The “fellas” arrived any hour and three beers
later. They didn’t seem to notice therdarkness
and walked right up to John. There were two of
them: one, tall and dark, the other shorter with a
blond crewcut. Janie noticed the smaller one right
A- away. He looked like her cousin, Al, she thought.
Everyone was introduced. The tall one was
Bruce;-the one that looked like her cousin, was
Mark. They moved into the booth, Mark sitting
right next to her. He sat so close she could feel

.-his leg pressing on hers beneath herskirt. They’

ordered more beers, and when John asked Janie,

“Another?” Janie replied “Sure”, and almost
meant it. The beer hadn’t tasted so bad any more.

Angie ‘came over with the beersand Mark
caught her by the string on her apron. “Hey,
Angie,” she said,’ “Where ya been hiding your-
 self?” ‘ '

‘ Angie -shot_ a ‘dirty look at John, then- smiled
eoyly at aviark." ,-“Right -here, baby,” she »said._

“Where you been?”
“Suddenly I can’t remember,” Mark answered".

.“VVhat time ya through?”

“Twelve.”

‘Twelve? Yea? That’s the time I was ﬁgur-
ing on cutting out.” '

Angie winked her wink at Mark, then swung

around so violently, Janie wondered how she
avoided breaking her hip.

Janie took a sip of the new beer, not noticing

the heavy foam. She started choking.

“Hey, doll, what’s the matter?” John asked.
“Nothing, just went down the wrong way.”
Mark started laughing. “Hey guys,” he said,
“fill her in—nothing‘ goes Clown the wrong way.”
‘The’ guys started howling at this. Janie con-
tinued to cough and excused herself, afraid she
was going to be sick. ‘ J‘
“Hope everything‘ comes out okay,” Mark said,
ordering another" round of laughter. ‘ I
When Janie stood up, everything seemed to
be spinning. She walked slowly! to the ladies’ room
and once inside, had to brace herself on the sink,
in order to hold her balance. She felt like she
used to feel when she’played too much tennis, and

it occurred to her that she must be drunk. The

thought thrilled her for a min-
ute. A wave of excitment ran

pricklings at her hair line. She
became dizzy again. She looked
«in the m i r r o r. Her eye-
liner‘ _was .- smeared underneath
the eyes that looked like cloud-
ed marbles. She looked for a
kleenex, but there wasn’t any—
‘she had to use toilet paper to
wipe the paint from her eyes.
There was a bug, .a big black
one on the floor near _the waste
basket, and’ she stepped on it.
She could feel the insect’s back
crunch underneath her shoe. She
looked at the ﬂoor where’ the
bug was still struggling, his rear
legs pinned to the tile. -She
_ shuddered and felt a wave of_
nausea grip her. She suddenly ’wondered if ‘this
is what everyone felt..like ‘When they were drunk,
and if it was, why in hell did they keep drinking.
The light from theceiling hurt here eyes’ and she
was scared to look back at the ﬂoor. She shud-
dered again and left.
_ “Excuse me," she said to Mark as she return-
ed to the _table.

Mark put his legs to one side so that she
could get by. She felt his knee run across the top
of her legs as she passed him. it

“What’s the matter, doll?” John said.
look green.” _ ’

“Oh, she’s all right,” Mark said. ‘‘She’s fine.
Just ﬁne.”

Janie glared at Mark-and he motioned for
her to come closer. He whispered something very
low and she only heard the word “tomorrow.” He
looked like he was waiting for an answer but
she didn’t have one and was too annoyed to think
of one. She was thinking he had no right touch-

“You

cousin, after all.

Suddenly, there was a loud thud from the bar
andeverybody looked up. The woman who was
sitting with Charlie Boy had fallen from the stool

' and. ‘now sat on the ﬂoor with her legs sprawled

out in front of her. v
“Old Mrs. McClosky’s atit again,” John said
as if it were one way of telling time.
“Aren’t you going to help h_ei'?" Janie asked.
_“What’s the use?” was his answer. “She’ll just
fall back down anyway.” i A
The other boys nodded at this as if it were

some kind of scientific" fact. s

Janie glared at John. His thin neck seemed
long and awkward and she noticed, for the first
time, that .he was badly in need of a shave. He’s
practically a bum, she thought, and started with
the realization of the truth of that thought. She
looked at the others at the table. Mark was drink-
ing beer as if nothing had happened, 'and Bruce
was watching the scene like someone watching a
ball game.

The woman was still struggling and falling,
and the people around her started to laugh. Janie
looked at ‘Charlie Boy. She couldn’t quite make
out the features of his face. All she saw was his
mouth that was stretched, at the sides in? an ugly

We went to the mountain to
make 1963 Ford-built cars.
90 30,000 to 100,000
miles ‘between major
chassis lubrications

Quite a task faced Ford Motor Company
engineers when they set out to eliminate the

' traditional trip to the grease rack every
1,000 miles.  .'

Like Mohammed, they went to the mountain- .
Bartlett Mountain on the Continental Divide in
Colorado. More molybdenite is mined there
than in the rest of the world combined. And
from molybdenite ore comes the amazing
“mo|y" grease that helps extend the chassis
lubrication intervals for Ford~built cars. This
grease sticks tenaciously to metal‘, stands up
under extreme pressures and resists moisture,
pounding and squeezing. It is slicker than
skates on ice!

New, improved seals were developed. Bushings,
bearings and washers of many materials were
investigated. Slippery synthetics, like nylon
and teflon, were used a number of new ways.

_The search for means to extend chassis lubri-
cation also led to New 0rleans—where_
experimental suspension ball joints tested in
taxicabs in regular service went two years ’
without relubrication.

it took time. And ingenuity. But the effort paid

off when Ford-built cars were the first to build '

in chassis lubrication good for 30,000 miles or
~ two years—whichever came first.

Another assignment completed—another
“Ford First" and another example of how Ford

MORGANTOWN—-Jim Markel,

West Virginia’s soccer coach, can
_ foresee a 9-1 record for his team
‘ which is 4-1 now, losing only to

' Pitt. 5-1.
When his team lost to Pitt,
Markel said, “This Pitt team

should have stomped us by at
least .15 goals.” The Mountaineers
went on to beat Frostburg, 4-1,
a team which bowed to the Pan-
thers, . 2-0.

Slippery Rock, 3-2 

The drenched Kennard Field
seemed like an ideal place for
Slippery Rock’s frosh team to play
soccer, but Coach Bob lVIcNulty’s
yearling booters upended their
plans, 3-2.

It was a comeback effort for
the weary winners who trailed 1-0
at halftime. The Rockets were
substituting new units every ﬁve!
minutes, while the Cubs only in-‘
serted three subs. _

“They tried to run us off the
ﬁeld,” McNulty said. ‘I was
proud of the way my boys held
up and fought back.”

George Jarmolenko‘ (“he’s our
big gun”) evened the score with
a successful penalty kick.. Then
the high-scoring center forward
took a pass with his back to the
goal, pulled the ball to the side,
and hammered it in.

George Sommérs, an inside left,

took ‘a shot on goal which the
Rocket goalie dropped and Som-
mers blasted it in. Now 4-0, the
