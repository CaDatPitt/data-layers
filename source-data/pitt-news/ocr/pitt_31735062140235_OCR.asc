game next fall between ‘Washingtonf
and Jefferson College and the Uni—:
versity was dispelled last week when‘
announcement was made that Davidi

Morrow, the new manager-coach oil

the Red‘ and Black, and Laurence 
Hurst had signed con-tracts, thel
actual signing of the documents hav-
ing taken place. .

This announcement was received-

with general rejoicing by University
students, as rumor was abroad in the
land that the annual VV. and J. game,
the big game of the football year,
would not be played. Immediately after
Morrow announced his acceptance of
the manager-coach position at Wash-'
ington, and Jefferson he received from
Manager Hurst a tender of a game.
He at once took the matter up with
the athletic authorities of the college.
who soon authorized the closing of
the deal. The game is scheduled to
be played at Forbes Field on Satur-

.day, November 18. '

MaiiagerVHurst stated that the con-

- tract this year was. similar to those

of the past few years with W. and J.,
there being the same division of pro-

ceeds decided on and the general -

conditions surrounding the annual
contest being unchanged. As in 1910,
W. and J. again this year, in playing
Pitt, agrees not to invade the Pitts-
burgh territory‘ with a football game
during the -season of 1911 without the
consent of Pitt. This means that
and J. will meet neither Penn

burgh ‘during the coming season.

GEORGE WASHINGTON.

The annual celebration of the. birth
of one whom the country has seen ﬁt
to call the father of the nation, brings
to mind the sterling qualities that made
the man a rea_lly great person. The
myth told the youth of the day, that
George Washington was never known to

a utter a falsehood is a triﬂe to the tale of

Santa Claus and other childish fancies of
the modern time. The immortal George
may have been so truthful, but it is a
poor precept, because no man is perfect,
and surely _one of themost simple temp-
tations is the act of misrepresentation

in small orlarge-things. It is not hard
to suppose that the leader of the revo-

lutionary forces was often called upon

«to decide issues very quickly and truth-

fully, and it is equally easy to imagine

that the peerless general did not hesitate

to diverge from the straight path of

‘truth, if the case was an. urgent’ one.

and in View -of the circumstances, insti-
fiable. This mere. quibble about a really.
great personage is; more of a contra-

, deceiving inﬂuence than an aid to the
amemorya of the :man’s character.

Tt is
the folly -of the American people in
choosing some small point of glorihca—-
tion to lose the essentials of true emin-
ence-. George Washington is entitled to
the position he occupies, ‘because he
stepped into the breech of danger when
his country was imperiled and by an
almost indefatigable effort led the un-
trained rustic army to victory over the

'.polished soldiers of England. It was an

‘example of ‘patriotism that few nations

have ever seen, this son of a weai'i:hv

and noted family in the front line of
the struggling colonial SOlCll(‘1":T. Tlie

Stars and Stripes iskbeing lost in the
mad desire of ‘America to place her

Jet us appreciate the men of the naI.ion"s

history as real, ‘living creatures, who

‘ have experienced the temptations of life
 and have succumbed like the rest of us.
.but who._have struggled on in spite of
A the hindrances.

The false halo that the
present day historians persist in weav-

have gone before, is ludicrous; the men

athletic affairs with a strong grip, as
indicated by his complete and well-
arranged football schedule announced
last week, and the thorough Way he
is going into the business affairs of

Thomas made the ’varsity nine here.

Although one of the expected im-
portant games on the 1911 schedule
———that with Penn State——has been
lost, Manager David C. Morrow, of
W. & J., has booked the threebig

engagements of__his season. The clos-

ing of contracts for the Pitt engage-
ment, consummated last week, was
the most important action of the new
football director’s short‘ career to
date. This gamewill be played in
Pittsburgh on Saturday, November
18. Previous to this the game with
the Navy had been accepted for Sat-
urday, October 14. Within the past
week Morrow .-has closed with West
Virginia University for Saturday, No-

at Morgantown.

West Virginia.

Since the close of the football sea-
son last. year there h.as been practi-
cally no activity in athletic’ matters
at the West Virginia University. This
dullness is due chieﬂy to the fact that
the University does not have a
basketball team owing to a two-fold
reason. The first is that there is no
place to play, the armory having been
refused the boys several months ago
owing to their rough usage of the
ﬂoor, making it unﬁt for dancing. The
second reason is that the University
Council has decided that there ought
to be atleast one term in the school
year devoted to study, since two of
the terms are taken up with baseball
and football. ‘

The indoor baseball work, which
has ‘been in progress practically ever
since the opening of the winter term
on January 5, has been suspended for
two weeks owing to the annual ‘1’I’llll-‘-
tary ball and the departure of Coach
George R. Kaler of the Cleveland
Americans. Coach Kaler left Thurs-
day in response to amessage from
Manager McGuire, notifying him to
join the squad at once. It had been
hoped to have Kaler remain in‘ Mor-

the demands‘ of his manager could
not be ignored.

E. A. Woods Dwells on Necessity of
College Men in Life Insurance
Business.

Last Friday morning E. A. Woods,
of the Equitable Life Insurance Com-
pany, addressed the students on the
topic of, ‘The College Man in Insur-
ance.” The points made were highly
interesting and went to show that the
day of the trained man in all the
branches of business is at hand.

It is the expectation of the editors to
publish at a future date the entire ad-
dress of Mr. VVoods.

There were represented on the vari-
ous teams men who had at some time
or other won honors for their various
schools and clubs‘.
first meeting of the factory relay
men spells assured success for this
event which Chairman G. Costin
is working so hard to make the most
notable event of_ the entire carnival
program. .

Chairman Dravo is getting together
an entry of college teams that will

make this competition, at least as an ’

indoor event, the greatest that has been
held in V\/estern Pennsylvania in some
time.’ In addition to the big uni.Ver_sity

relay, in which Mike‘Murphy will send

the pick of University of Pennsyl-
vania distance men against one of the
big Eastern ’v:arsity teams, a great
lineup of Western Pennsylvania
colleges has been-secured.

One of the latest to be heard from
is W. & J. Dr. Kirschner sent word
that he was ﬁnally able to announce

that they would come to Pittsburgh ~

on March 10 to battle for the indoor

Western Pennsylvania c-haimpionship. »

W. & J. has a very strong team and
in addition, owing to the fact that
much of their training isdone on a
small indoor track, are especially cap-'
able at indoor running. They hope
to be in such shape that they will be
an important factor in the college
championship.
