A < . Yang visits Mainland China

.Prof finds Chinese sobergloyall

by aoN LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor
The most striking change in
China since the Revolution has

been "the change in people." re- .

marked Dr. C. K. Yang, profes-
sor of Sociology here, at a special
press conference -last Thursday.

v Yang recently returned from a
28-day tour of the People's Re-
public of China. where he was

with the first group of American
social scientists to be admitted_to

that country.
“It was the professor's first re-

_ turn there after a 20-year absence.

According to Yang, the most
notable changes were in the in-
habitants’ character, commit‘-
ments, and attitudes “toward

. themselves and society,” parti-

cularly the attitude of the young
generation toward the old.

Yangalso said that the "people

once did.

' "The attitude is generally se-
rious. They’re dedicated, disci-
plined.“ he said. "I would say the
vast majority are loyal; dedicated
to the government."

Yang said he found the Chinese
to be politically conscious people,
re-
garding their nation’s acceptance
into the United Nations.

Yang also said that he and his
associates were allowed great

’don’t smile as much“ as they.

“freedom of discourse” with the»

Chinese‘ people. He recounted-an
exchange..that- occurred between
one of his colleagues and a mem-

* ber of the Red Guard—a highly in-

doctrinated youth. Theyoungster

States was never mentioned in the
discussion.

In fact, the people’s reactions

to him as an American were quite’

favorable,.stated Yang. who was
"welcomed with an ocean of ap-

Based on his own experier,ices.,

queries that “President Nixon
should get much more enthusiasm
than hostility" on his projected
trip to the East. ‘

Yang’s "journey took himito six

"Programs were arranged ‘for,

“but wewere free to detach our-
selves" and venture elesewhere.

Because of the shortness of the
trip. Yang said he felt his impres-
sions to be somewhat "superfi-
cial and limited." However. he
said he noticed material changes

mentioned‘earlier.- —

Though there has been substan-
tial progress, the Republic “re-

mains a country. behind in the

"If you look, the cities probably-

show . a bit of decline in com-

merce. business. and so on."_

"But. continued Yang. “I would i

say that what-history has dictated
has come to their (the Chinese
people's) benefit.

He noted that one no longer.ob-
served‘ signs of_ starvation, desti-
tution, or beggars in the streets
such as once existed. The average

income is 35 American dollars

per month per worker, but Yang
pointed out that the cost of rice
is only $14 per hundred pounds.

“The rent is unusually cheap,“

he said. “Housing varies from

made over,units to. brand-new
ones.“ Price: $1-4 per month. a

Medical costs were also found
to be extremely low. While away.
Yang received free
of charge treatment for which he
would have -paid $14-100 in the
states ‘and was told ‘the same
service was available to anyone,
simply for paying between 30

cents and $1 every month.
The workersalso enjoy retire- _ ’

ment benefits, said-Yang, with the
precise age fixed by the‘ individ-
ual’s own work group. A person
may collect 70-100 per cent of his
former pay, depending on need.

But. according to Yang. it is the
children who are given special at-
tention. Yang said he found the

More time needed "

The Student Affairs Advisory
Committee voted Thursday to
postpone its decision on the pro-
posed Student Association Con-
stitution to allow more time to
review the document in detail.

Steven Kaye. chairman of the
Constitutional Review Subcom-
mittee. read the committee’s pro-
posal to the Advisory Committee
(SAAC) and answered some of the
questions raised by SAAC mem-
bers. Other committee members
present detailed the reasoning be-
hind the proposals structure.

Jan Miller. the only committee
member who failed to endorse the
document. said . that the commit-
tee had been under too much pres-
sure to come up with a workable
solution. and although the docu-
ment had many good. qualities.
there were.‘ too many gaps and

' » loopholes still to be resolved‘. _-

Magistrate Earl (Harris agreed Friday morning, when University 1

One of the students,who were arrested Nov. 11, said they have not  
been advised what the judiciary proceedings will be, though their law -

_ yer has offered to represent them if they are permitted counsel. - ' ' ‘

“Actually,” the student said, “it’s such a relief to get off the crim-.

inal charges, no one has been in too much of a hurry to find o_ut aboutthe ~ 

judicial proceedings.”

Probably, actionibefore the University.J'udiciary will be delayed’

until the office of adjudicator for the judiciary is filled. The announce— ’

ment of his appointment is said by informed sources to be forthcoming.

Thursday, Alfred Moye, dean designate for the Office of ‘Student 

Affairs, released a statement concerning University policy.

Quoting the interim Student Conduct Regulations, Moye said? '  ' A
"The University will‘not enter into or authorize the entrance into a'pri-‘ -‘ C

vate office or living area except inicases authorized by law or where"
immediate maintenance to the area is required.3'

He defined cases authorized by law as “where a violati
imminent peril of serious personal injury is involved.”

He said that University police officers would be expected to abide‘, 77
peace officers when seeking entrance to a ' 

by the same rules as other
"student's room.

“Generally, they would be required-to have a search warrant au- .

thorizing their entry," he said, “and. additionally. they would be

obliged to state their identity and purpose."

The campus policemen who made the arrests Nov. 11 entered the ;  I

student's room without a search warrant. on the grounds that the situa-

tion was a possibleemergency.

Whenever possible, Moye said, officers would be expected’ to h
la-Housing employee present when entering a dormitory room.

No Housing employee was present when the campus policemen en- 

tered the room Nov. 11.

Moye emphasized that “the University police are authorized to in-5 
‘vestigate and initiate appropriate legal action in cases arising under," 3

the dangerous drug laws.“

serious and blatant violations.”

A cardinal value of the University community. Moye said, “is ‘re=— 

‘-15 .

He added, “The dormitories are not a sanctuary for conduct ofun-
lawfulactivities and the University should not, and will not, condone

spect for the dignity of the individual'.‘'

Commenting on Mo_ve‘s statement. Gil‘ said. "I agree wholeheart-A ”'.f.

edly with the stated. need for respect for privileges of the individual\

and that is what we have attempted to practice in the past. The da"y-to-x  :.._-
day practice of the police department is to

for the individual."

SAAC postpones Constitution

Wade Lawson,‘ Student Asso-

ciation Committee’s Commission-' ,

er,_ asked that any vote on the mat-
ter be postponed until ‘after the
Thanksgiving recess since “the
time element should not dictate
the decision in a matter as impor-
tant as this.”

However. members of both com-
mitteesweminded him that they
would have to make a decision
quickly. since they were close to
the end of the term and student
government elections were sched-
uled‘ early next term.

In a compromise move suggest-
ed by SAAC member Ken, Kren-
icky. the members of both
groups agreed to meet Friday to
discuss specific items after they
had had time to examine the pro-
posal in detail. . - ' .

According to James Naughton. White House
correspondent for the New York Times, the Nixon
Administration has erected a wall between itself
and Washington newsmen.

“This is an administration which wants to get
to the public. but not through us (the news media).
Newsmen do not mingle with higher-ups in the ad-
ministration." Naughton told a speech class here
last week.

The slender journalist explained that this lack
of personal contact with Nixon officials prevents
reporters from understanding the men and conse-
quently the politics they represent.

‘'It is to their disadvantage that the press
doesn't see the real" Richard Nixon. We don‘t know
Nixon. and don't get that side of the story." Naugh-
ton said. A

_"We get the version they want us to have. But
when things are left out it may color or distort the
the story for the public.“ Naughton declared.

Nixon’s press secretary Ron Zeigler, claimed
Naughton, also represents an obstacle between
newsmen and the facts.

"It is hard to get an answer from Ron Zeigler.
and White House correspondents are continually
trying to interpret his ambigious statements."

Nixon ’s ‘iziggles’ rapped

Naughton said.

"Zeigler frequently says he can‘t answer a
question or doesn't agree with the premise of a
question." Naughton added.

Washington reporters have coined the term
“ziggle” to describe a noninformative answer and
Naughton did not hesitate to lampoon the briefing
tactics of Zeigler.

“If it were positively rumored that Nixon was
to meet with Alice in Wonderland. Ziegler would
probably tell us. ‘there is at present no information
I can give you on the possibility of such a meeting.”
Naughton joked.

The Times correspondent also criticized the
White House for releasing statements without spe-
cifying the person responsible for the statement.

/ He also condemned officials who although telling

journalists the story, deny the facts to the public.

“Today in Washington there is a tendency for
public officials on the hill and in the executive
branch to say things ‘off the record,’ not for rec-
ord,” Naughton said.

In’ reference to recent criticism of the media
by Nixon officials. Naughton said. "People in the
administration say that Nixon had the worst press
of any President this century. He may well have de-

I served it."

Yang noted that the ideas of

Chairman Mao are imprinted in
children's minds right from the
beginning.

“The mentality of that genera-
tion will be very telling 10 years

from now,” he predicted. ‘
Discussing other aspects of the

educational‘ system. Yang re-
marked that compulsory educa-
tion through high school is follow-
ed by a period during which each
youth must work for at least two
years. Reports on work perform-
ance form a large basis for col-
lege acceptance.

Steered according to his desires
and abilities, “the freshman

commented Yang. The you_t_h thus
obtains "a clear definition ’6I:;¥~.i._s

Yang denied that the objective
of the cultural revolution is to
smash the family. citing instead
its ‘two major objectives as over-
coming revisionism (backtrack-
ing) and traditionalism (lack of
progress). Yang concluded that
he found the Chinese family “re-
duced in functional importance.
but structurally it has kept its sol-
idarity more so than in the West."

DR. MARINA WHITMAN, Economics p
dent's Price Commission, believes public cooperation is vital to Phase
I |l’s success. _

 

WhitII'l(tIl tcrnts price
bortrcl plan “realistic”

by JUDY DECKER-

Marina Whitman, University
economics professor and mem-
ber of President Nixon‘s Price
Commission. explained the Com-
mission’s program during a re-
cent press conference.

“It is a realistic system with a

. good chance of working and it has

a better chance than any other al-
ternative,” Whitman said of the
Commissions policy.

However, she emphasized that
the program's success depends on
the cooperation of the public and
that “it can succeedonly if the
people want it to work.” '

Whitman said that the present
‘period is one of uncertainty. but
that this is bound to happen in the
transition from a "simple” Phase
I to a more flexible, complicated
Phase II. She said that this uncer-
tainty will dissolve as specific
problems are presented and de-
cisions are reached.

When questioned on the Price
Commissions amount of power.
Whitman said that the Commis-
sion’s approach is not to replace

the market. but to have it operate 4

within the standards set by the
Commission.

SCULPTURE by Donal J. Smoley

rently on view in the Velar

of Industrial Administration at
Carnegie-Mellon University.
The Gallery is open to the pub-
lic Monday through Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The ex-

.hibit will continue through
Nov. 29. ‘

Therefore, she said, the actual
“power” of the Commission is
quite limited practically, in that
Commission members want the
economy to function in as normal
a way as possible.

Whitman said that as an econo-
mist she basically doesn‘t like
economic control but that at this
time a short term control is ne-
cessary. There are many strong

’ reasons for this control. she said.

and a break in the inflation cycle
was needed.

Although Whitman is the only
female member of the Price Com-
mission, she reported that this
has had no impact on her work-
ings with the other six members.
In the meeting room, she said. all
members are equal, and her sex
"couldn’t matter less.” '

Whitman also said that the

rotessor and member of the Presi-

members of the Price Commis-
sion work very well together.

“There has been a considerable reduction in in-

Jack Gibson. one of the first
black radi0._announcers in Ameri-

mass media not to "take the little
piece they want to give you."

"You‘ve got to be involved." he
said. "You have to make a com-
mitment; I have made a commit-
ment to help my brother."

Gibson helped operate the first

black radio station. WERD. in At-
lanta in the early 50's. “We devel-
oped black radio to such a point
that it was a powerful media in
our town."

Today there are 600 black ra-
dio stations in the U.S., but only
eight of these are black-owned.

“Black radio has been a‘ farce. ‘

practice by enforcing the rule which prohibits al-

Blacks are even moving into TV
now. If you are entertainingythe
idea of entering the record busi-

time is right.“

' He said black music is getting
bigger today. "We really didn‘t

The decision I on whether to continue enforciingid
the rule will be made by the Athletic Department. ,
Casimir Myslinski, director of Athletics, was 
unavailable for comment on the future of the rule. '

Despite the booze ban, a few ingenious-students _
have found ways-to smuggle their school spirits pasts:
the security men. 3 “ .-

One fan related how she carried two bottles. of

Pot smoke baffles cops
    in C escapade of errors  

A if The campus police, by and large, ‘are highly regarded by students.
*;T_hat reputation was marred on the night of Nov. 11, when two cam-
,pus_po_I‘icemen arrested nine students in at Tower A room for possessin
an" ounce of iriarij uana. ’ I
,_  The two officers apparently stumbled onto a pot party while re-

ponding to a complaint about a “disturbance.” Arriving on the scene,
ztlie-y— allegedly saw “smoke coming from under the door” and assum-
;ed‘there. might be a fire. On the grounds that the situation wasa pos-
gsible emergency, they used a master key to enter the room. Inside,
‘they found the s.tartled students and the marijuana. ,

_— Although no formal rules on the subject exist, it is generally un-
derstood that a master key is to be used only in case of emergency.
‘And, given the evidence, the officers should have‘ been able to discern
that an emergency situation did not_ _exist. M
i ‘_ ~.T_o begin with, the officers were not merely responding to a call
about a "‘disturbance_.” According to one of the officers, the radio mess-
age also mentioned “something like the possible smoking of mari-

  

I f With this in mind, the officers should have been appropriately cau-
iv,-tious. Police procedure in case of drug usage is very different from be-
havior in case of emergency, and the officers ‘should have determine
which situation confronted them. ‘

y  When they arrived,. one of the officers claims, they saw “smoke
‘coming out of the room.” If the officers actually saw marijuana smoke,
they are to be commended for their extraordinarily keen eyesight.

smoke, one of the officers ‘said, “I’m not in a position to say whether
,i_t’.s?p'ot that’s burning or a blanket that’s burning.” P l

 If the two officers could not identify the odor, they could have
asked. Outside the room was one of the room's tenants, who was using
aipho_ne that slid under the door into the room.  A — _

 ' Maybe he didn’t have a cold and would have been kind enough to
tell, them that ablanket was not burning. ' ~

‘ t- f At the very least, the officers could have asked the student whether

anyone was inside before they barged into the room. V
{ 4 “In all actuality, I didn’t even consider the fact that there were

5ther- people in the room,” one of the officers has said. Presumably,
the ‘tenant moved his phone outside his room’ to admire the texture of
the Towers’ walls. A

Since people were obviously inside, why didn’t the police ask those
inside to open up, instead of using a master key? V

right to decide

by ELLEN GANLEY ..
1 1 Night Editor_
The Constitution guarantees every man and
woman the right to free speech and the right of
assembly. ’

Last Saturday, there was a serious attempt to ‘

deny pro-abortion women both of these rights.

An abortion rally and seminar was scheduled
for 3 p.m. on Saturday in L-9 Clapp Hall. When some
of the women planning the seminar arrived before

the meeting, they found signs on the building’s doors - '

that read“‘Abortion Rally Cancelled, Nov. 20: ”

After finallygetting into the building, they were '

told by the custodian that someone had told him at 8
am. that the rally. was being called. off and that he
should lockthe door and turn off all the lights.

When we arrived at the rally at 3 p.m. the doors".

were open, the lights were on, but there were only

,35 women waiting for the rally to begin. Apparently,

women had come for the rally, seen the signs, and
left. The signs. seemed to keep reappearing. When
one was taken down, another.would appear within
10 minutes. «

Three of us”'were sitting on the floor of the lob-C I

by of Clapp, discussing theepisode, when the lights
went out. We searched until we found the master

Editor: '

Of the four years I’ve spent eating atthe Tow-
ers cafeteria, three of those were spent eating Saga
food. — ‘ ’ '

To me, Saga food was the worst thing ever de-r
vised by modern man. The food was the was constantly ,

found to be poorly cooked, raw, and tasteless. It

was truly somethingwhich the stomach could not‘-

take without some pain involved in the process.

In light of this fact, Ieagerly looked forwardto
eating the food of the new service called Szabo, now
several months old. For the first time, I waited in
anxious anticipation of the food of which ‘I was about
to partake. V

My first reaction to the meals was extremely
favorable. This was due to the fact that the meat
was cooked well, potatoes and vegetables were_gen-
erally not raw, and -the various desserts were fresh.

Except for the hamburger and hot ‘dog diet ev-

ery day at lunch,fI was fairly happy with the new
service. .

 

Soon, however, strange things began to happen.
Fruit flies and regular flies began appearing, be-
coming rather annoying at times.

One day in particular‘, I remember ablack bug,
very much alive, popping out from what'I thought
was my broccoli. However, at the’ time I thought I
wasimagining things. ’ i I -

And then came the ultimate. On Monday, Nov.

P 15, I prbceeded to-pick_;a few pickles from the tray
with a‘ ladle, being an avid pickle lover. Upon sitting

_ down I found a strange specimenbetyveen, the pick-

les, a pickled miller, well-preserved.

For those of you who have no idea what a miller
is, it’s of the moth variety but is not as nice looking.

The only suggestion I have is for Szabonto elim;
mate the flying insects and‘ more carefully examine

, the food they are preparing to insure sanitary con-

ditions. Ralph‘Nadar, where are you?

switch and turned the lights back on. The saboteur
was still in the building.

But the “phantom’s” efforts were to no avail
Of course, many people were discouraged from at-
tending the rally by the signs, but the people who
were there participated in a very interesting group
discussion, listened to knowledgable speakers, and
heard testimonials by women who _have had abor-
tions.

Many of us left the rally feeling enlightened,
encouraged, and very angry.

Our anger stemmed from a number of issues,

Besides the way in which women are categorically
being denied the right to decide whether or not they
want an abortion, there was the whole fiasco with
the signs. There were many suggestions as to who
were the culprits, and more than one suspicious
glance was aimed at the demonstration going on at

Magee Hospital and the airplane flying over the.

Pitt-Penn State game, trailing a streamer that read
"Abortion Kills.” ' -

‘ But responsibility for the act is not the main
issue. It was done and it was an effective political
tool. What really concerns me is that an anti-abor-
tion group felt the need to resort to such a Mickey
Mouse tactic. Are they really that afraid of what
we're saying?

 Health Center response

Dr. Joseph Hinchliffe, director of the Student Health
Center, from the Undergraduate VWomen’s Union.) a

A Dr. Hinchliffe: ,

We, the members of the Undergraduate Wom-
en’s Union, feel that in View of your present actions,

the following demands should be acted upon imme-

diately: V

-——'—Priorities should be set immediately for tem-
porary cutbacks in services and staff hours to
‘help deal with the present budgetary crisis. C

——The decisions of where these cutbacks will oc-

cur must not be made until a mass meeting of

' ‘ ., all concerned undergraduates is held and their
‘ priorities are voiced.

———.Emergency measures must be taken immedi- I

ately to supply women with gynecological treat-
ment. We feel that this demand must be met in
no more than a week. . V

———No policy decisions about gynecological serv-
‘ ices should be made unless the Undergraduate

Women’s Union is consulted. We feel this is '-

tives of Pitt women in this matter.
——We demand that the Health Center’s budget be

warranted as we havevbeen active representa-

~ printed in the Pitt News with an explanation of ‘

why the deficits have-occurred. Included in this
report would be a detailed plan and budget of
the recent remodeling program. ’ ’ i

——We strongly feel that an intensive investigation

‘ into the administration of the Health,Center is . ”

warranted in view of the recent policy. deci-
’ sions and budgetary deficits. C

The undergraduate women of the University
are angered by your attempt to use us as political
tools. We refuse to. be usedas a means to bolster
your request for more money from the administra- ‘

We hope you take these demands into consid-
eration and act immediately upon them.

Audience rudely. bubbles

Arena facilities dim 'Supe1'star”

by BOB GEDEKOH

Jesus Christ, Superstar, the rock
opera that originated as a record
album, became a hit Broadway
play and will soon become a mo-
tion picture. struck Pittsburgh
last Wednesday and Thursday
nights like a thunderclap.

The appearance of a concert

company at the Civic Arena pro-
duced massive traffic jams and
a variegated audience of nuns.
priests. Sunday school members.
children, teenyboppers. hard rock
fans, and Lawrence Welk enthu-
siasts.
_ The play concerns the last week
in the life of Christ and his cruci-
fixion. emphasizing Christ as a
man ratllier than as a deity. It asks
the question. “How would we re-
act if. Christ were to appear on
earth today?"

Hence we are presented with a

— hip Jesus in blue jeans, Mary

Magdalene‘, a sweet but confused
prostitute, and a black Judas who
betrays Christ for the love of his
country rather than for 30 pieces
of silver. -

’ The apostles are portrayed as a
crew. of egotistical and drunken
idealists who attach themselves
to Christ so that someday they
can "retire and write the gospels.”

Bruce Scott‘ handled the role of
Christ quite well. with the vocal
endurance required to sing the
difficult rock music for an extend-
ed period of time. However. it
took a half hour before he turned
away from the orchestra and
started singing to the audience.

Holly Lipton performed well in
the role of Mary Magdalene; her
voice was similar to that of
Yvonne Elliman who sang the

role on the original album and is
now appearing in the New York
cast. '

Carl Anderson as Judas ex-
hibited a fine rock style with a
touch of soul thrown in for good
measure,

The orchestra. under the direc-
tion of Irving Joseph. handled the
accompaniment well. although the
pauses between each song were
distracting and an open invitation
to unwarranted audience applause.

The play was presented in con-

lcert form at the arena. without

props or extensive costumes. This
is directly opposed to the treat-
ment given the play by director
Tom O’Horgan (Hair, Oh Calcut-
ta) in New York. which included
extensive visual efforts and cos-
tumes.

Critics in New York may dis-
dain O‘Horgan’s stage tricks. yet
I cannot help but wonder if a little
more showiness wouldn’t have

helped the Pittsburgh performance.

One woman mourned, “Never
before have I paid so much to see
so little.” She wasn’t complaining

'about the quality of the show, of-

the performances, of the actors.
Rather. she was riled at having
paid $5 to see a concert at the far
end of a hockey rink.

It is-nearly impossible to be-
come involved in characters when
you can’t even distinguish their
faces. To many individuals it was
like attending a flea circus at
Three Rivers Stadium.

With the new Heinz Hall. the
Syria Mosque and the Nixon The-

ater all in Pittsburgh. I wonder
why Superstar was presented in
the Civic Arena.

Perhaps Judas was not tempt-
ed by the silver pieces. but the
show‘s producers obviously were.
No doubt they made a handsome
profit by packing the arena full
two nights in a row, at least more
than they would have cleared had
they scheduled it for a smaller
auditorium for a longer run.

The inadequacies of the Arena
were emphasized by the poor (or
nonexistant) stage direction. The
entire cast was packed onto one
side of the stage, soloists got only
as far as the middle. A

This certainly added to the sus-
pense. if nothing else. because it
gave the audience the impression
that the cast would all roll off the
stage at any moment. The few
ingenious lighting effects that
were attempted were dwarfed by
the massive arena. 

Nor did the behavior of the au-
dience enhance the performance.
Both young and old individuals
babbled rudely throughout the
show. One girl even broke into
hysterical laughter when Judas

-- betrayed Jesus with a kiss, and

the audience provided thunderous
applause at some. very inoportune
moments. '

If the experience was a little
less than what one might have ex-
pected‘, it was hardly the fault of
the performers or the material.
Rather it was the’ fault of the fa-
cilities, the staging, and the audi-
ence.

AN EVENING OF MUSIC is scheduled for St. Paul's Cathedral Sun-

'\

day, Dec. 5, at 8:30 p.m. The event marks the ninth anniversary of

"Strrmge noises’ mar

lmroque performrmce

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

An ever—growing interest in
baroque music has been evident
these past months. especially this
past Saturday when the music de-
partment continued its explora-
tion of this period with a program
of Bach. Couperin. and Handel.

Despite endless rainfall and bit-

ter chill. a capacity audience fill-

ed the Frick Auditorium for an
evening of pleasant. unobstrusive
listening. 4

Don Franklin. harpsichord. and
Frank Trificante. viola da gamba.
joined New York Pro Musica
member Herb Myers for the open-
ing.offering. a Sonata in C for re-
corder and continuo by G. F. Han-
del.

Myers’ alto recorder technique
is basically sound, although it
strikes one as being perhaps too
anemic as far as performance
quality is concerned. One could
not help but sense a certain un-

‘ easiness throughout his rendition.

 

A -glittering interpretation of
Francois Couperin’s Eighth Suite
for harpsichord followed as Don
Franklin ably demonstrated his
keyboard technique toathoroughly
captivated audience.

What makes Franklin’s per-
formances so clearly enjoyable is
the fact that he feels every note
that he plays and, at the same
time, conveys to the audience the
joy he receives from being so in-
volved with the music. '

His understanding and execution
of the many complex rhythms and
harmonies found in this suite are
praiseworthy indeed. It is always
a pleasure to hear "Le Grand”
performed in such a very grand
manner. ‘

Another sonata followed inter-
mission as Trificante and Frank-
lin collaborated in the Second Son-
ata in D for viola da gamba and
harpsichord by J. S. Bach.

The performance was not an es-
pecially first-rate one in that
many strange noises consistently
-found their way into the music.
These strange noises were evi-
dently wrong notes and as such,
they gave the entire procedure a
rather sloppy sound.

Polyphony continued to reign as
the program concluded with
Bach’”s cantata for the Sunday af-
ter Christmas, Walk in the Way of
Faith. We all had "faith” in our

performers as they took their
places on stage. but doubt had
soon replaced any such feelings
as the chamber group rushed its
way through the opening sinfonia.

All the instrumentalists were
indeed‘ going places but not at
quite the same tempo. Bass
Thomas Dean then made his con-
tribution with an aria and a recita-
tive series. much‘ more mel-
low and as resonant as ever.

The next aria was performed by
soprano Mary Ann Doody who
seemed to have considerable dif-
ficulty with her voice, especially
in the higher range.

Doody and Dean then concluded
with a balanced duet in which
neither voice overpowered the
other. It was a satisfactory per-
formance as far as the audience
was concerned. but one doubts
whether J. S. Bach would have
felt the same.

°Dance1's’ delightful

by ART ROSENBERG
Drama Critic

The Truth About Russian Danc-
ers is the second dance produc-
tion given by the Studio Theater
since last Janua-ry. Last year‘s
production. although well—done.
was of limited appeal since its
contents were expressed solely
through the medium of modern
dance.

Dancers, by James Barrie. who
also penned Peter Pan, incorpor-
ates the traditionalacting form
with ballet to make it appealing
both to those familiar with this
more traditional area of dance, as
well as to that audience new to
ballet as a form of artistic ex-

pression.._
It is a delightful fairy tale that-

is short, to the point. and quite en-

. tertaining. The story deals with a

Russian ballerina who comes to
visit an English home and the
weird events that happen during
her visit.

Choreography by Jeanne Bea-
man is appealing and artistically
accurate. In its subtle intricacy is

GIVE THE NATION
BACK TO ITS PEOPLE

John W. Gardner, Chairman
Common Cause

Former Secretary
of Health, Education and Welfare

Who said citizen action is futile? Populism in the
nineteenth century left an indel-ible mark on the
nation.‘ Citizen action won the vote for women in
1920 and brought the abolition of child labor. The
labor movement, the civil rights movement, the
peace movement, the conservation movement ‘— all

began with concerned citizens. If we had waited for- .

‘the government or Congress or the parties to initiate
any of them, we'd still be waiting. Try to think of a
significant movement in our national life that was
initiated by the bureaucracy. Or by Congress. Or by
the parties. ’

For a while, we lost confidence in our capacity to
act as citizens, but the citizen is getting back to his

feet. And citizen action is taking on a tough minded .

professional edge it never had before. Never has our
society needed more desperately the life-giving
spark of citizen action. We must make our instru-
ments of self-government work. We must halt the
abuse of the public interest by self-seeking special
interests. ’

The special interests buy favor through campaign
gifts. What flows back is literally scores of billions of
dollars in tax breaks, in lucrative defense contracts,

in favored treatment of certain regulated industries,-

in tolerance of monopolistic practices. And the tax-
payer foots the bill. - ' 9 -

To combat such pervasive corruption, we must
strike at the‘two instruments of corruption in public
life,—money and secrecy.

To combat the corrupting power of money, we
must control campaign-spending and lobbying, and
require full disclosure of conflict of interest on the
part of public officials. ‘

To tear away. the veil of secrecy, we must enact

. “freedom of information.” or “right to know" statutes

which require that the public business be done pub-
licly. And that’s only ‘a beginning. We can regain
command of our instruments of self—government.

' To accomplish this, each citizen must become an

activist, especially the college student with his ‘

newly acquired right to vote. He must make his voice
heard. Common Cause, a national citizens’ lobby,
was created to accomplishjust that. it hoped to en’-
roll 100,000 membersin its first year, and got that
number in 23 weeks! On its first anniversary, it had
200,000 members. -

- It was the chief citizens’ group /obbyinglor the Constitu-
tional Amendment on the 18-year old vote.

° It joined with environmental groups to defeat tile SST.

- It brought the first real challenge in a generation to the
tyrannical seniority system in Congress.

- It helped bring the House of Representatives to its first
4 recorded vote on the Vietnam War.

- It has sued the major parties to en/oin them from violat-
ing the campaign spending laws. , i

There is much more to do. And the time to do it is
now. The American people are tired of being bilked
and manipulated- |t’s time to give this country back
to its people. For additional informatiomwrite Com-
mon Cause, Box 220, Washington, D.C. 20044.

which is exciting to watch, both
visually and technically.‘ It is wov-
en into the story so that both
dance and dialogueare insepar-
able. Each, however, is separably
entertaining.

Looking at form. movement.
and transition in the execution of
the dance. three deserve special
mention.

Tanya Cocuzzi displays a fine
style. Her interpretation of some
difficult and demanding choreo-
graphy is well—done. and her over-
all presentation is consistently
executed. —

Both she and Gail Olson display
fine form. As a member of the
Corps de Ballet Maureen Pricci
presents a good deal of delicate
and well-balanced movement
while maintaining a controlled and
consistent interpretation through-
out the show.

In the role of the Maestro, J. B.
Nader is delightfully sinister. An
effective and accurate portrayal
is given via expression, delivery
and movement. Steve Pellegrino,
as Lord Vere, gives an equally ef-

" fective portrayal that is energetic

and consistent.

Buiilliling Quixote cliases (Iream

by CINDY NI()RGA.\'
Entertainment Editor

The Twin Coaches. premiering
its first season of dinner-thea-
ter. began with the well-chosen
favorite. Man of La Mancha,
starring Canadian (Jary Farr.
also one of the show's producers.
as Don Quixote.

The stor_v opens during the
Spanish Inquisition at the end
of the sixteenth century in a
dismal prison. Writer Miguel de
Cervantes is forced to defend
himself to the prisoners in order
to prevent his manuscripts and
costumes from being destroyed
and distributed among the mot-
ley crew. I

In doing so he begins the story
of Don Quixote and his travel-

T ing companion Sancho.

And so Gary Farr (Cervantes)
instantly dons a few extra whis-
kers and applies shoe polish to
his hair, and transforms himself
into the 16th - century bumbling
Mr. Magoo-type character who
mistakes -windmills for ogres,
and a town “barmaid” named
Aldonza for a beautiful prin-
cess for whom he chooses
the name Dulcinea.

Fairs portrayal of this knight

 

in rusty armor with his bent cork-
screw sword is one of the most

moving characterizations pre-
sented in this area for a very
long time. He will make _you

swallow a lump in your throat.
and also make you laugh.

His acting is totally superb.
his voice strong and vibrant. yet
sounding like you would expect
an old man's to sound (though
Far is only 30 l.

His dialogue rings loud and
assured. and he gives the musi-
cals most popular song. The Im-
possible Dream, drive. emotion.
and meaning.

Dulcinea—Aldonza is lustily
portrayed by Pamela Bennet.
who reminds you a little of Eli-
zabeth Taylor in the Taming of
the Shrew.

Bennet skillfully allows you
a glimpse of the soft-heart which
lies beneath the surface of the
supposed hard-hearted, man-kick-
ing shrew.

She is confused when she fin-
ally meets a man who "loves
pure and chaste from afar“. and
kisses her hand. instead of throw-
ing a sack of coins at her and
expecting her kind favors in re-
turn.

Her voice cries. demands at-
tention. and breathes fire into
one of the musicals key charac-
ters.

The staging. at first.. promised
to be incredibly annoying. and
audience members felt they
might have a difficult time see-
ing the action if they happened
to be sitting farther toward the
back of the room.

But as the lights went out, no-
body had trouble at all. The sets
were totally realistic, but with-
out the skillful lighting of Wil-
liam Dreucchi, the effect would
certainly have not been as
splendid. The shifts in lighting
transformed the same set into
the prison one minute, and the
tavern the next.

The music. directed by Ben-
jamin Sloane. was crisp. quickly
paced. and clear. and with lit-
tle imagination. you could hear
the approaching “clip—clop" of
Quixote's and Sancho‘s horses
in the overture.

This production of La Mancha
was a credit to its producers and
director. who paid remarkable
attention to detail. and also chose
one of the most fitting casts ever
assembled for production.

wove  
102.5 FM

Each role. from the Innkeep-
er to the Moorish gypsy dancer.
was skillfully and professionally
developed. never spoiling rhythm
or emotional impact of the audi-
ence.

Most noteworthy of the other
characters were Sancho, Jim
Mikuoa, and Padre, Michael Sor-
rentino.

Sancho was loveable. and prov-
ed the perfect. faithful side-
kick to a man such as Quixote.
a man who often got himself into
trouble with his good intentions.
He was most memorable as he

—n4ﬂ3ClFMﬂ

humorousl_v sang. “The Massive"
and "I Really Like Him" to Al-
donza.

The Padre. though a relatively
minor role. was outstanding. and
demonstrated his clear. versatile
voice in his final tune. “The
Psalm.“

The Man of La Maneha jux-
ta;oses the life of the writer
Cervantes with that of the myth-
ical Quixote. who is really Al-
onso Quijana. who is considered
to have gone “insane“ by his
relatives when he leaves his
comfortable home to become a
knight.

Both individuals must learn
to face reality in the form of
death, Cervantes most memor-

ably in the hands of the Inquisi-

tioners.

Perhaps The Man of La Man-
cha is about man choosing to
live in the face of reality or de-
ciding to be idealistic.

Or perhaps it is being able to
live through all the turmoil any-
way. but “trying to right the un-
rightable wrong." and to "beat
the unbeatable foe.“

The cast swept the audience
into the dream. which for them.

seemed far from an impossible‘

task. It is a shame that one has
to drive as far as Route 51 and
Interstate 70 to see possibly the
best musical production now
being offered in the area.

_With Mitchell, fullback Tom
Donchez, and quarterback John
Hufnagel running through, over,
around, and in-between the Pan-
ther defense, the Lions’ offens
K moved at will. ‘

Hufnagel‘ also found_ the air
lanes quite open as he threw for
three TDs in the first half. Two I
were bombs—a 52 yarder to tight
end Bob Parsons, and a 49 yarder
to split end Charley Herd. Both
men were wide open in the Pitt-
secondary. 4

In the secondhalf, Coach Joe
Paterno alternated. his first and
second units as both teams scored
three touchdowns apiece. Pater-
no explained his use of the first
string while leading 48-12 by say-
ing, .“I_got nervous-I was just
afraid what could happen’ because
it. looked like Havern got the hot
hand.”

Havern’s “hot hand” connected
with Moyerc _on two touchdown
passes in the third quarter, and a" _
final-minute strike to Les Block-
for the 18 Pitt tallies. ‘

Pinochle partner pulls. in Pitt passes

by JERRY MYERS
Sports Editor.

Little did I know. when I first walked into my dorm

 . room freshman year. that my roommate would turn out
 to be one of the greatest pass receivers in Pitt football
' ' history.

Steve Moyer sat comfortably on one of the beds as I
cautiously entered the pie-shaped room. We introduced
ourselves and in time I was soon immersed in the world

‘.1 Vof Pitt athletics—exposed to. yet not a part of. the daily

practices. the block rosters. the training tables.and the
grueling routine of college football.

Steve came out of Upper Perkin-
men High School. a no-less-than four
letterman. He played shortstop for
the baseball team. ran for the track
team. started at guard for the bask-
etball squad and quarterbacked the
football team. With all that behind
him. the native of Pennsburg. Pa..
a small town just south of Allentown.
set out for Pittsburgh. . '

MYERS “I narrowed my choice down be-
tween Pitt and Penn State,” said Moyer at the Pitt foot-
ball luncheon last week where he was one of the two guest
football.players. “I chose Pitt because I liked the people

' I met out here and I wanted to be part of the building pro-

gram.”

Saturday. before 39.000 people in Pitt Stadium. .\Ioy-
er showed how valuable he was to the "building program"
that he longed so much to be a part of. Besides breaking

I ’ Bob Longo's career record for most passes received

1106). Moyer caught two touchdown passes. fielded punts

A and was prepared to take snaps for Eric Knisely on PAT

attempts if Dave Havern got hurt’.

The transition from high school quarterback to col-
legiate receiver came early in Meyers undergraduate ca-
reer.

“I was a quarterback for about a day,” joked the six
foot senior. “Every day during practice my freshman
year, they used to send some guys up to the varsity to run
patterns against the defensive ends. I went up there and
caught a couple." ,

' "Coach (Bill> Lewis. who recruited me. said that

‘maybe I should work out at flanker or split end. That was

the last time I was a quarterback."

Living with a college football player is certainly a
dynamic experience. Playing pinochle until dawn. engag-
ing in snowball battles at three o‘clock in the morning. and
staging water -fights in the hallways were all part of that
unique freshman experience. As the years go by that ener-
gy becomes channeled into other outlets.

With his wedding coming up on Dec. 4, Steve is very
concerned about his future. He has hopes of going into

the pros but shies away from anything resembling opti-»

mism. A teaching profession is his most likely alternative.

"I'll be student teaching next term and then I hope I I

get a teaching job next year.“ ‘commented the veteran
flanker.

Although he lacks the large size and the blinding if

speed thathavebecome commonplace in the National Foot-
ball League. Steve has quickness and probably the best
set ofhands on the team. His success at Pitt will certainly
get him plenty of consideration when the pro draft rolls
around in January.

Steve’s seven receptions against Penn State Saturday
upped his total to 113 careerwise,’ 33 this season. His 106

yards marked the first time in three years that Moyer
had an “over-a-hundred” yard game, pushing his receiv-
ing yardage to 1,219. Impressive to say the least.

With one game left Steve looks back on his years at
Pitt nostalgically. "It was a lotiof fun. I just wish we had
a really great season. It would have been great to have a
bowl experience. That would have been fun."

Along with the fun. there was plenty of hard work
