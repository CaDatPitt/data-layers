__ .,By Anita. Barone

Alexander Brook of New York was
announced as ﬁrst prize winner of
the 1939 Carnegie International at
the Founder’s Day exercises held in
Carnegie Music Hall last night.

Featuring an address by Archibald
MacLeish, recently appointed Li-
brarian of Congress, the exercises
preceded the formal opening of the
International, the only annual exhib-
it of its kind in the world, and the
awarding of the prizes. With the
award, Mr.. Brook will receive $1,000
for his painting, “Georgia Jungle.”

Second prize of $600 went to Ya-
suo Kunivoshi of Woodstock, New’
York, who though born in Japan has
an important place among American
artists. His canvas is entitled “Lay
-Figure of 1938.”. A
Third Prize ‘

Marc Chagall, Russian born but

' ranked with the French artists, was

awarded third prize of $500 for his
painting “The Betrothed.”

The jury which made the awards
was composed entirely of artists.
They were Gerald L. Brockhurst of
London, England; Hipolito Hidalgo de
Caviedes of Madrid, Spain; and Eu-
gene Speicher and Edward Hopper,
both of New York“ City. Homer
Saint-Gaudens, Director of Fine
Arts of Carnegie Institute, was chair-
man of the jury.

pean paintings were in Pittsburgh
before war was declared, and the re-
maining ones were received after the
outbreak of hostilities.

Pitt’s Team and Coach
Make Good News

VVe think the following editorial, reprinted
from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette of ill/Iionday, O’ct‘0’-L
ber 16, is self explanatory. V .

Perhaps there are schisms at Pitt. They may
affect the trustees, the faculty, even the stu-
dents. But there are no schisms in the football '
team. " "T ,

Saturday’s game called for not only team '
work but a spirit to win. A little ﬂagging of,
that spirit and Pitt would have been "snowwefd L
under by apteam which was fully its equal. But
Pitt won the hard way, coming up from“-behind
once to tie, and once to do better than that.
Time after time alert individual members of the I
Pitt team struck down their opponents behind
the line of scrimmage, a. perfonnance which Duke
could not match. Out-kicked by the southemers,
the Pitt players had to depend on their heads as

A well as their feet. ' ’ .

It was a. demonstration of will to win that
may not be duplicated again this season in the
whole country, and an evidence of sportsman-
ship that will stand in Pitt’s football annals.

To the above editorial, we would like to add a

ley, who is quietly going about his business and
becoming a candidate for coach of the ‘year.
P-robably no one is less concerned with the latter
possibility than Bowscr himself, but if the Panthers
continue to play the amazing football which they

will certainly deserve consideration for the inyth-
ical title.

If any (';()d.(i'll ever was on the spot, Charley
Bowser was that man last spring. He came to a
school wliose football team had be”en»directed by
Jock Sutlicrland for 15 years. Sutlierlaiid was
leaving as 21 popular hero. Any successor would
have been vicwetl by the public as an unwelcome
usurpcr. A w '1

Charley wisely stayed in the backgrou1id._,. wait-
ing until the shouting had died. But. while he
stayed in the background, be molded a foot.ball
team the likes of which has never before been seen
wearing Pitt jerseys.

It’s a smart team, a gambling tcaiii, a colorful
tcani, and it is deﬁnitely Charley Bowser’s' team.
The fans like it. The fans are begiiiriing to like
Charley Bowsei‘. And that, in the face of wliut
has passed, is a triumph for the man whose job
was supposed to be too big for him.

In the first place, there has been no cliange of

To The Editor

Band Drum Major

Dislikes News Comment
Editor, The Pitt News:

After reading several articles in the Pitt News con-
cerning the ability and reputation of the Pitt Band, I
have reached one conclusion: that, when criticizing a
musical organization such as the Pitt Band, someone
with musical ability and experiences should be the one
to do it. Miss Welfer may be a fine feature writer but
when judging band music well, conﬁdentially.

About the SMU Band, well, there should be abso-
lutely no comparison. They have a swing band; we
have the finest military band of any college, SO WHAT!

So in closing let me say that whether the band is
brassy, off tune or not, that is a question for a MUSIC
CRITIC to decide, not the editor or Miss Welfer.

JIM HUNTER, BA42,
Asst. Drum Major,
Pitt Band.

If Mr. Hunter would reread Miss Welfer’s column
of Monday, he would discover that it was written as a
humorous comment onthe letters received from Pitt
Band members last Friday. Miss Welfer’s column was
not intended as an adverse criticism of the Band.
‘ ’To clear the record, we repeat the substance of the

. comment which we made Monday about the Band. We
'- like the Pitt ‘Band, and we think that it is doing a fine

job. A To cdoptiithe motto of our Sports Editor, “We

Pittpourri
j By The Kristufeks

It’s reliably reported that although he made the
first touchdown (also the second one) in the Pitt-Duke
game, “Dandy Dick” Cassiano refused that offer of a
free supper and kiss made by Dolly Dawn. And here
we were under the impression that Richard was a gen-
tleman. , .

Our hearts develop a few more cracks every time
we see Miss Scott in the Dean’s of Women’s oﬂice and
realize that some lucky fellow has taken her out of
circulation by means of an engagement ring. We hates
engagements. , V '

Seen chewing their ﬁngernails while watching the
spirited action at Duquesne Garden’s_ Roller Derby
this 'week were D. J. Bailey with Nancy Sundstrom,
John Hughes with Midge Frobuck, and Harold ‘Net?
with “Pat” Patterson, the Alabama Kid . Inci-
-dentally, we believe that acting in the professional
rassling racket is developed to a higher degree than
that of the skaters. _ '

Those frequent telephone calls that Bill Marshall,
BA39, a freshman law student at Harvard, makes to
Ruth Rea, Pitt lovely, puts quite, a dent in his weekly

allowance. One frogskin per three minutes of ‘ chat-
ter. _ L -

Those SFA assembly meetings are more fun than a
barrel of monkeys. Some of the verbal battles are real
pips. Rugged i“-dependent, Jack Hoeveler, can bandy

‘ words with the best of them. '

That phrase, “Beautiful, but dumb,” certainly doesn’t
apply to Marjorie Johns, pride of Mount Lebanon.
After founding and editing “Charmyle,” women’s fash-
ion magazine, she sold it for three grand, which money-
she is using to ﬁnance her education here at Pitt.‘ Hey,
lvlarg, how’s about a date?

Seen yelling for dear old alma mater at the Pitt-
Duke hair raiser -last Saturday were Virginia Worek,
Charlotte Harris, and Adeline Butera. No wonder the
Panthers won If the Screw—ball Hop isn’t a
howling success, it won’t be the fault of the committee.
They certainly have a lot of novel publicity ideas.

Those two purty freshies who iwere kissed by
“Big Chief” Kish before the newsreel camera’ man’
at the Pep assembly last week will be disappointed to
knowthat there wasn’t any ﬁlm in the camera at the
time. Oh well, girls, you made Ben happy, any-
way Speaking of the games. the gang will be
out at the Willows for the football rally tonight.‘

, For this week’s Pittpourri Hall of Fame we“ are
honored to have two of our outstanding seniors, Patricia

Elmer and Dick Weiss- ZTA “Pat” is the daughter of '

Professor Flmer, head of the Sociology department, and
she is president of WSGA. Besides being president of
the Sophomore class, she was assistant editor of the
Owl. was a member of SFA, a member of Xylon, sec-
retary of WSGA, and won the Junior spoon award. A
good student and avcapable worker.

Tall, dark. and popular are the words for Dick Weiss,
Pi Lambda Phi prexy and editor of the Owl this year.
Among his other activities are Druids, Inter-fraternity
council, Cap and Gown business staff, and member of
the publications board. Dick’s main ambition now is
to make this the best Owl ever, and we are sure that
it will be.

They’ll Be Gunning for Panther Saturday


JOHN YURCHEY

Undefeaited Duquesne  ine Spot
Of Week Against Panthers at Stadium Saturday

A glance at Pitt’s schedule showsy

the Panthers playing host this Satur-
day to their neighborly rivals, the
Duquesne Dukes.

Thus far, the Panthers! have given
the leading sports experts a real sur-
prise to say nothing about the oppo-
sition faced as. to date.

Duquesne will enter the game the
underdogs, the same position occu-
pied by Pittiwhen the boys took the
ﬁeld" "against Washington and Duke.

The Dukes left town Wednesday
to prepare for tomorrow’s tussle and
have every intention of upsetting
the dope and disproving the sports
.writers’- contention that the Golden
‘Panthers are the number one team
of the_East. I

A radical change in the starting
line-up is planned by the Bluff coach
with Carl Nery, kicking star, moving
over to left tackle from left end, and
senior George McMillin will be at the
left-terminal at the opening kickoff.
'_ ‘Teaming with McMillin and Nery
{on the opposite side of the line are
-;;John Yacina,; 190-pound sophomore,
ﬁand Aldo Mazzoni, rugged 211-pound
senior. The center triumverate con-
sists of guards Sirochman and Corbo
{and center Demao.

\ Notre Dame’s shift will ‘carry on
?in‘the backﬁeld with either senior
Johnny Yurchey or sophomore John-
:ny Petchel barking signals, Chatonic,
and Donelli, juniors, carrying the
§mail from the tailback positions, and

Dukes Seek Revenge

Revenge for last year's 27-0 defeat
will be the Duquesne motive when
they take the ﬁeld this Saturday.
Many of the squad played as regu-
lars against the Panthers last year
and nothing would please them great-
er than a Duquesne win (after Pitt’s
surpising victory over the Duke
“Blue Devils.”

Guarding one of the terminals for
the “Night; Riders” and handling the
punting assignment is Carl Nery.
Springdale, lad, remembered as the
player who boomed one for 73 yards
to put the Oakland entry back on its
heels last fall.

Showing exceptional speed and
agility in the hilltopper backﬁeld is
young Allan Donelli, brother of the
rival coach. Al has been going great
guns in all three games played so far
and will give the Pitt secondary
plenty of trouble.
iVrhova»c at Center '

Holding down the center of the
line and playing the same brilliant
type of ball as his predecessors Gra-
binski and Basrak will be Nick
Vrhovac, junior from Brownsville
High. On one side of Nick is Walt
Padlo, senior, and on the opposite
side is Bill Nopper, junior from Pitts-
ton, or sophomore George McMillin.

Although Pitt’s cross-country ag-'

work cut out for him again this Sat-
urday when he toes the starting line

1938.

In whipping Smith, Fehr helped

for the sum of their bombardment.

If someone would condescend to shoot both Fordham and Washington,

we of The Pitt News could boast of a better prognosticating average and
a perfect prediction on last week’s winners.

Of the nine games listed in this

column, seven were selected on the

right side of the ledger with Washington’s defeat by Washington State and

Tulane’s triumph over Fordham going

against the grain.

"Seventeen games have been pre-9
dicted within the past fortnight, and
12 have been right for an average of
71 percent. ~ “ ~ .. ‘

ﬁnd Pitt the winner over the Bluff
eleven after a busy afternoon. The
Dukes waged a tough battle against
Manhattan last week and came off
the ﬁeld victors by a 7-0 score. How-

Dr. Williams Analyzes Present
Trend on European Continent

By Alf

The continent of Europe can maintain only one or two nations built in"

Schnur

accordance with the long range political, economic, and military operations

demanded by the present-day world.

This is the opinion of Dr. B. H. Williams, professor of political science,
who this week declared that scientiﬁc prediction of the future is now

impossible.

Although declining to make abso-9

lute predictions, Dr. Williams agreed,
when interviewed, to make the fol-
lowing interpretations of the pres-
ent trend in world affairs.

“This war arises partly from a
conflict between large scale economics

and small scale nationalism in which

the economic ‘factors will probably
prevail. The tendency will then be
toward political organization on -a
larger scale,” he declared. -

German Conquest V .-
“Europe may be made into one or

two larger states by appealing new

doctrines that may spring from the(

necessities of life and from the des-
peration following a terriﬁc war.”

German conquest of a large part
of Europe is another possibility, Dr.
Williams presented. 3

A third interpretation is that after
the,European nations have spent their
energy in ﬁghting each other, Russia
might step in to pick up the pieces.

The democratic states on Europe’s
western fringe might -well be com-

bined into one state by an -as yet;un- *

developed system of political organ-_
ization, Dr. Williams also stated. The
ﬁrst step—alliance, the second—-con-
federation, the third-union.
Small States

The states in the corridor reaching

from Finland to Greece seem to Wil-_

liams, to be too small to survive.
Most of these states will very likely
be absorbed into greater and more
powerful states. It is possible’ that
the people of these states .may. be
able to secure some autonomy even
though they lose their political iden-
may take a ‘considerable time, Dr.
Williams is ‘sure that it is on the
way. .1 *. .

If Great Britain ‘ and France sur-
vive the war, their governments will
probably turn to the left.

Economic Competition

When Dr. Williams compared the
rise of the British Empire with the
rise of other ‘states, he noted that
the empire has been losing ground
since 1890 in the race for world power
and leadership. ’

The loss is a result of this previ-
ously successful world economic unit
being surpassed industrially by other
countries. The British Empire has
for some time been feeling the ef-
fects of the ﬁerce economic competi-
tion of successful rivals.

Dr. Williams concluded that liberal

democracy is ﬁghting a losing battle
in Europe.

‘Haitches’

‘Life’ Begins to Err
With F raternity’s Name

All that stood between truth and
inaccuracy was the letter “h” in last
week’s issue of Life, weekly picture
magazine, when it printed a picture
of one of the rooms of the Gamma
Sigma chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha,
social fraternity house, “under the
caption “Phi Kappa Alpha.” ‘

Will Parker, San Francisco youth,

versity campus on his way to the
New York World's Fair, was the sub-
ject of the magazine’s feature article.
He hitch—hiked the\ 3,100 miles ‘in
twelve days, getting rides in 29
cars. 1‘

Indiana, Parker was picked up‘ by

and was taken to Pittsburgh. Thomp-
son and other PiKA members fur-
nished Parker with lodging for the
night. _
In the magazine picture Parker is
found asleep on a cot in the Pi Kap-
pa Alpha house. A Pitt pennant
decorates the background.

York’s Mayor and “Little Flower,”
came to Pittsburgh to address the
American Public Health association
at the Hotel .Wi,11iaf,m Penn on Wed-
nesday, he was brought to the Uni-
versity, "‘to get the real atmosphere
of Pittsburgh,” as Cornelius D. Scul-
ly, mayor of Pittsburgh, ‘said.

LaGuardia was entertained at a
luncheon at the Faculty Club after
being given a rapid view of the Ca-
thedral. “The entrance to the Uni-
versity is very impressive, and the
art work is beautiful,” were the first
words spoken by the mayor. '

Sport fans will remember LaGuar-
dia for his interest in New York base-
ball teams. However, the stocky
leader isn't so well up on his football
teams, for he says that Fordham will
have to win when the Panthers jour-

The key-giver of ‘New York city
(not Grover Whalen) is vitally.inter-
ested in student opinion on world pol-
itics. Concerning the" present em-
bargo act, he claims that the Amer-
ican students’ opinion is divided on
this issue just as opinion is divided
outside of college circles on the same
question.

For those interested in whether a
visiting dignitary_ has any eating pe-
culiarities, the case of Mayor La-
Guardia may be cited. He doesn’t
care for an appetizer, likes black
coffee, and does without his dessert.
After a meal he is content to chew
on a large black cigar.

At present the hive houses about

to determine the life span of a bee

Each day newly hatched bees will
be painted. The ones hatched on
Monday will be colored blue, those
on Tuesday yellow, and so on. Each
day careful records will be kept of
the number that die. These data will
