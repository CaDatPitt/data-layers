Piﬂ kicks out Zeta Beta Tau

Fraternity has five days to appeal decision

By‘Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pitt fraternity Zeta Beta Tau,
already on probation for violating
alcohol policy, was permanently
kicked out of the university yester-
day.

The fraternity has until Tuesday to
appeal the decision, which stems
from the arrest of three ZBT brothers
in October for taking nude pictures of
Pitt students while they showered.

“As far as I’m concerned, they’re
history,” said Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Student,Affairs
Dennis Donham. “I don’t think they
belong here — _ever.”

The decision was released in a let-
ter, of which The Pitt News obtained
a copy, written by Donham and sent
to ZBT president Steve Rosenthal.

“Effective immediately [the] Zeta

Beta Tau fraternity no longer exists
as a recognized student organization
nor as a fraternity recognized by the
university,” wrote Donham in the let-
ter. “I am making this decision to
protect the university community
from any further misdeeds.”
Rosenthal said he had no comment,

and a fraternity brother who answered '

the door of the ZBT house yesterday
afternoon also refused to comment.

The letter states that ZBT has five
days to appeal Donham’s decision. If
it does not, or if the appeal is turned
down, a housing problem could arise.
Currently, the fraternity lives in a
university owned house on University
Drive.

“The university will consider termi-
nation of the house lease,” Donham
wrote in the letter. However, Pitt offi-
cials were uncertain what would hap-

OZBI} page 3

The following is an excerpt from the
letter Dennis Donham wrote concern-
ing Pitt’s decision on ZBT

The time has come for the fraternity
to be judged by its actions not its words.
The university cannot afford to wait
for someone to be harmed from exces-
sive drinking, nor can it wait for the
brothers to realize that the women on
this campus deserve to be treated with
respect and dignity that is due every
individual at the university. The univer-
sity is not obliged to recognize fraterni-
ties whose members behave in such a
detrimental manner.

I therefore am informing you that
effective immediately Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity no longer exists as a
University of Pittsburgh recognized stu-
dent organization nor as a fraternity.

Finals are near, students can study safely

By Melissa Pearlman
Staff Writer

Backed—up printer lines,
overcrowded library tables
and pressures of exams are
the major obstacles that stu-
dents will be facing as the
semester comes to a close.
With all this added stress in
mind, it is important for
students to be aware of the
safest study options when
preparing for finals.

Once again, the Student
Government Board has des-
ignated five safe study areas
spread out over campus to
ensure that students have a

safe place to study at late
hours of the night.

The William Pitt Union,
Hillman Library, the
Cathedral, Scaife Hall and
Benedum Hall will all be
open until 2 a.m. through
Dec. 14.

Along with the safe study
areas, SGB, in conjunction
with the department of
Parking and Transportation,
has instituted an additional
shuttle.

The Safe_Study Shuttle

' will run a route between all

the. safe study areas. It will
begin at the William Pitt
Union and circle through

campus to all areas, running
every 15 minutes.

“We want to do every-
thing we can to make sure
that students get from study
spot to study spot safely,”
said Abigail Schlesinger,
chair of the Public Safety
Committee.

In conjunction with the
Safe Study Shuttle, all other
shuttles will be running
their regular routes. The
PAT bus will be an option
for students as well. This
year, however, there will be
no shuttle service during the
winter break, due to low
student response in past

years. The shuttles will
resume their regular sched-
ule on Jan. 4.

“Students were not utiliz-
ing the service, and this
year we have the PAT buses
for students to use,” said
Michelle Moors from
Parking and Transportation.
Moors also added that the
64U and 74U will not be
running from Dec. 17 to
Jan. 1.

Gary Moses from Public
Safety, ensures students that
all Safe Study Areas will be
well lit and patrolled by Pitt
Police officers.

MOSCOW — A car bomb

The attack, which occurred
at lunch time in the center of

several homes, hurled one car

PASADENA, Calif. — A six-
year odyssey will culminate
Thursday when the Galileo
spacecraft becomes the first
craft to orbit Jupiter or any of
the four giant outer planets.

Over the past six years, while
travelling 2.3 billion miles,
Galileo has flown by Venus
once and Earth twice, observed
fragments of comet crashing
into Jupiter and endured intense
interplanetary dust storms.

It faced its share of setbacks,
as well, like a jammed antenna,
but it has met a long-range goal
— orbiting Jupiter. It should
arrive and swing into an orbit of
Jupiter to embark on at least
two years of observation of the
planet. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

Vice Chancellor for Student
and Public Affairs Leon Haley,
who will make the final deci-
sion if ZBT appeals, could not
be reached for comment.

Donham said he hopes‘ the
entire campus, not just fraterni-
ties, gets a message from this
decision.

“They [ZBT brothers] are
adults, and they are responsible
for the consequences of their
actions,” Donham said.

ZBT was already on social
probation for having a keg in
its house at a party and serving
alcohol to people under 21.
The probation was scheduled to
end soon after the brothers
were arrested.

“They ran pretty close to los-
ing their status once before,”
Donham said. “They were

As students look forward
to going home for the holi-

“Take home all small

Moses said. “All buildings

On Nov. 1, Pitt Police_put out
arrest warrants for Scott
Borsky, Gregory Gallina and
Michail Losifidis, the three fra-

ternity brothers involved in the 

incident.
Police said that on Oct. 29

the brothers stormed through 

women’s bathrooms in Tower
B, ripping down shower cur-
tainsand taking pictures of
naked women.

They were stopped by police,
and the pictures, along with a
Polaroid camera, were found in
the backpack of one of the stu-
dents.

The day after Pitt Police
issued the warrants, the
students turned themselves
in. Donham said the students
will still have to face the
Judicial Board individually.

As Susan walks off the ele-

_ vator on the day she goes to

thing she notices is the sign on
the wall above a table. It reads,
“Please sign in under a name,
and you’ll be taken in that
order.” Susan thinks that’s
strange.

‘But PATF understands
anonymity is important for
many clients. Cummings

Opinions

i Good job, Pitt

Finally. The university has finally decided to take some action
against people who violate the rules. The immortal '(or infa-
mous) fraternity ZBT isofﬁcially no longer a campus organiza-
tion. “

Because of the stunt pulled at the end of October by three
brothers of ZBT, the fraternity has been officially kicked out of
Pitt.

In a certain aspect, it is a shame that the stupidity «of three
individuals can be such a detriment to any of the ZBT brothers
who had nothing to do with the picture-taking. Some of the
brothers are just your average fraternity brothers who wear three
letters on their chests and live with a bunch of other guys.

Unfortunately, the brothers who had nothing to do with the
incident did make a mistake of sorts. They chose to associate
themselves with others who had the potential to get them into a
lot of trouble. Clichés may be trite, but they still hold a grain of
truth: you will be judged by the company you keep. In a Greek
organization, this is scripture. Greek life revolves around a
sense of brother or sisterhood, and the members of any organi-
zation are supposed to stand or fall together.

ZBT better hope there is a pile of feathers wherever lands.

The fact is, ZBT has been in trouble before, as have a lot of
other fraternities. The university has had many opportunities in
the past to set an example for fraternities which break the rules,
but, until now, Pitt has let their transgressions go with a slap on
the wrist. Last year ZBT was put on social probation for violat-
ing IFC and Pitt regulations by having a keg in its house. The
probation was supposed. to end soon, but before that could hap-
pen, PhotoGate exploded in ZBT’s face like a flash.

Since ZBT violated its probation, it is entirely appropriate that
“effective immediately Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity no longer exists
as a University of Pittsburgh recognized student organization
nor as a fraternity ...” (Dennis E. Donham, Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs). Anything less would have been
an unacceptable punishment.

(It would not have been enough if only the three members
directly involved were punished. Because the pictures were
taken as a part of a fraternity activity (regardless of whether or
not instructions were misunderstood), the entire fraternity
should be prepared to accept responsibility for what happened.

“The time has come for the fraternity to be judged by its
actions not its words,” wrote Donharn. ZBT used up its apology
excuses in the past, and this time it finally learned that actions
do have consequences. Sorry, guys, but we don’t apologize for
this.

Dennis Donham should be congratulated for making this deci-
sion. He chose the correct course of action for dealing with the
situation, despite the inevitable barrage of hate mail he’s going
to receive. It’s about time Pitt found someone with the nerve to
stand up to fraternities that don’t play by the rules.

Promote awareness in all cultures
to understand their true meaning

Many people seem
opposed to the National
Education Association’s
proposal to include homo-
and bisexual history in our
public schools’ curriculum
by having an awareness
month. From the informa-
tion which I have heard and
seen, this month is going to
start on a small scale. By
hanging posters which sim-
ply promote sensitivity
towards lesbian, gay and
bisexual people, I think that
the NEA will be successful
in influencing children and
teenagers that gays and
bisexuals are human.

For example, an idea for
one of the posters is to have
a group of nameless chil-
dren with a caption saying,
“Which one of these chil-
dren looks like a homosexu-
al?” How can a simple
poster like this harm? Why
should something natural be
hidden? Instead of people
shoving this issue under the
carpet for most of the for-
mative years of childhood
and suddenly being forced
to confront the issue when
one possibly goes to college
and finds that his or her
roommate is gay, why not
begin education early?
After all, if you were to ask
any bi- or homosexual if
they were going away,
they’d say no!

So deal with it earlier,
promote sensitivity earlier.
In my eyes, the more aware-
ness that is spread about
other “lifestyles” or cul-
tures that are present in
America is the only way
that we can have a truly
united nation. Thus, it
deeply troubles me to see
people vehemently opposed
to this awareness month.

Let me propose a couple
of questions: are there more
black people in America

Columnist
Amy Sitnick

now that there is a Black
History Month in public
schools? No. Is there more
awareness of essential con-
tributions in history that
were previously left out of
public school textbooks?
Yes. Are there more females
in America now that there is
a Women’s History Month?
No. Is there more aware-
ness? Yes. (I think that I
should quickly interject that
I included these two points,
because many people are
seeing the NEA proposal as
a “recruitment” to the bi- or
homosexual lifestyle, and

this frightens them.
However, it is far from
this!) -

Both of these are impor-
tant steps to lead the United
States to become a more
“informed” country. Having
an awareness month
wouldn’t affect the number
of homo/bisexual people in
our nation. It would spread
awareness. But would it
reallymatter? As we all
know, America is a melting
pot of cultures. If we "aren’t
accepting of all facets of
life, how can we really be
the strong country that we
crave the rest of the world
to portray us as? We must
stop the war within our own
country!

So, maybe in my eyes, the
acceptance of bi/homosexu-
al month is representative
of society in general. We
need to stop fighting each
other! People rejecting peo-
ple because of their sexual
preferences must stop. The
racial tension must end.
Females‘ and males are
equal, yet unique. A

Our generation is respon-
sible for cultivating change.

We are the ones who are left
with the decisions that are
being made. For-example,
the baby boomers boomed
and left us to deal with the
deficit. So, what do we do?
If you see something that
bothers you, work to change
it. Making a phone call to
your state representative to
save your financial aid or
joining a cultural group or
volunteering or studying in
a foreign country or really
paying attention in your
Russian history class, etc.
are fabulous things. Take
advantage of the endless
diversity around you and
make it unity.

I want to steer clear from
any political standing and I
am not saying that any party
right now is right or wrong,
but if you see something
that you believe in, take a
stand, even if it doesn’t
affect you directly.
Obviously, I’ve graduated
from elementary, middle
and high school, but I
learned on my own that the
rumors in 11th grade
English class that Walt
Whitman was a homosexual
were true. To return to my
original point, being bisex-
ual, lesbian or gay isn’t
even the big deal. Not
including people who are in
history books is. I’m sure
that many bi/homosexual’
people had a great deal of
influence in our past.
However, I didn’t read
about it in my public school
textbook. .

If you could further edu-
cate me on this proposal or
would like to comment on
my stance on this issue. feel
free to e-mail me at
alsst42+. Thanks!

fradition is said to be the
essential DNA makeup of
any society. It’s the core
of our actions, beliefs and over-
all way of life. And without tra-
dition, we would be lost We
would be hopelessly searching '
for a common ground in which
to function as a cohesive whole.

But oftentimes tradition is
what binds us to stale and out-'
dated philosophies because peo-
ple are reluctant to change our
sacred past.

Professional baseball effec-
tively altered its storied tradition
when it moved to a three—divi-
sion playoff system in each
league. '

It’s time for college football to
make a similar change.

With the exception of the
Fiesta Bowl, which features No._
1 Nebraska and No. 2 Florida,
the rest of the bowl games are
meaningless. The winner of the
Fiesta Bowl will be crowned the
national champion. But what
does the winner of the Holiday '
Bowl gain?

Nothing. All the other bowl
games have no national implica-
tions, no real importance and
nothing to get excited about.
Who really cares if North
Carolina or Arkansas wins the
CarquestBow1? Sure, the win-
ner will own the proud rights of
being the Carquest champion,
but what then?

’ That's the point. There is noth-
ing else. The current bowl sys-
tem is not only crooked and
inconsistent, it lacks the excite-
ment that college basketball’s
March Madness generates.

College football must kill its
glitch-ﬁlled bowl system and
move to some sort of playoff. A
clear example of college foot-
bal1’s loopholes is last year when
Penn State and Nebraska tied for
the national title. Because Big 10
champion Penn State was bound
to the Rose Bowl, it couldn’t
play Nebraska for sole posses-
sion of the title, thus taking away
from the luster of the two best

. teams playing against each other

at the end of the season.

If there were a playoff system,
it would avoid having co-cham-
pions and create more excite-*
ment for college football at the
same time.

Here’s a simple solution: The

The Pitt lady Panthers dropped all four of
their matches at the National Invitational
Volleyball Championships last weekend in
Kansas City and ﬁnished the season at 19-15.

Pitt accepted a bid to the NIVC after failing
to» get a bid to the NCAA Toumament for the
ﬁrst time in six years.

“It was definitely hard not to make the
NCAAs,” coach Cindy Alvear said. “This
group of seniors has never not gone to the
toumament.”

The Lady Panthers opened up play Friday
facing 22-10 Fresno State. Pitt dropped the
first two games 16-14 and 15-10 before
bouncing back to take the third game 15-7.
Fresno State controlled the fourth game 15-
10 for the win.

As a team, Pitt hit .286 and had_ only 19
errors. Jennie Driscoll had 17 kills and hit .429
in the loss. Sarah Mikla, Sara Mitchell and
Armemarie Tarara each added 11 kills. Mikla
had a match-high .526 hitting percentage.

Pitt went on to meet up with the Lady
Badgers of Wisconsin Friday night. Heather
Dodaro’s 16 kills, along with Lauren Bumy’s
10 kills and .400 hitting percentage, sent the

. Lady Panthers reeling to their second loss,

this time in three straight games 15-13, 15-10
and 15-9.

“In our second match, we faced the team
[VV1sconsin] that eventually won the tourna-
ment,” Alvear said. “We could not scout the
teams we played, and that really hurt us. At
that point I think the seniors saw the writing

afternoon. The Lady Billicans took the first

in the fourth, to force a deciding ﬁfth game.

as Saint Louis prevailed 15-13.

Indoor track seniors
shine at Kent State

By Geoﬂ' Moak
Staff Writer

If the ﬁrst meet of the season
last Saturday at Kent State is any
indication, the Pitt men’s and
women’s track and ﬁeld teams
have a lot to look forward to. No
team scores were kept at the
meet, but several outstanding
individual performances high-
lighted the day for the Panthers.

“There were three borderline
phenomenal performances,”
coach Steve Lewis said.

The star of the day was
Najuma Fletcher‘. En route to
qualifying for the ECAC cham-
pionship in the pentathlon,
Fletcher qualiﬁed for the national
championship in the high jump
with a leap of 6-1 1/4. VV1th that
jump, Fletcher broke her own
school record of 6-0 1/2. Her
time of 7.81 seconds in the 55-
meter hurdles, is the second
fastest in Pitt history. Only
Allison Williams, currently on
the Pitt coaching staff, has run
faster.

The third phenomenal perfor-
mance of the day belonged to
Angie Martin. Martin broke her
own school record of 2:07.30 in
the 800 meters.

“That time would be number
-one or two in,the nation right
now,” Lewis said. “But she won’t
get the recognition she deserves
for it because she was second in

1 the race. Angie took second to

the runner-up at nationals last

« year.”

It was a solid meet even for
those who didn’t break records.

Pitt dominated the 55-meter
hurdles, with both men and
women taking the top three
spots. Fletcher is a provisional
qualifier for nationals in the
event with her time. Second-
place finisher Tonya Mullins
qualiﬁed for the ECAC champi-

onship at 8.16 seconds. On the

men’s side, Jay Murphy (7.58),
Orrel Green (7.65) and Jerel
\V1lliams (7.72) all qualiﬁed for
the IC4A championships.
Williams also ran the second-
fastest 200 meters in Pitt history,
22.06 seconds.

The women also trampled the
ﬁeld in the pentathlon, taking the
top four spots. Fletcher easily
won the event-with 4,228 points,
only 67 points off the school
record Shana Fadis came in sec-
ond, Tonya Mullins in third and
Megan Ferrara in fourth with a
career-best score of 3,110.

“We had outstanding perfor-
mances from our seniors,” Lewis
said.

In addition to seniors Fletcher,
Mullins, Murphy and Ferrara,
Ayne Allen won the 400 meters
with a time of 57.44 seconds,
qualifying her for the ECAC
meet. Allen also qualiﬁed for the
ECAC meet as a member of the
winning 4x400-meter relay team

Staclium facility project
increases recruiting
competitiveness  

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

(Editors Note: This is the ﬁrst of a two-part series on the new Pitt ath-
letic facilities and their effect on recruiting.)

The hallway ﬂoors are covered with such trippy, patterned carpet-
ing, the setting would be a perfect place for ﬁlmmaker Stanley
Kubrick’s next work

There is enough weight equipment in the weight room to turn every
student on campus into the next Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The state-of-the-art rehabilitation equipment is owned only by peo-
ple like Pope John Paul 11.

Phase I of Pitt’s The Second Century Fund, an eight-phase plan, is
completed as Pitt football tries to round the comer in the battle for top
recruits and to recapture the glory years of the 1970s and early ‘80s by
reinventing the look of Pitt Stadium. .

“I can’t understand why Pitt can’t get the recruits over the last seven
years or so,” said Tony Dorsett, Hall of Fame running back and Pitt’s
all—time leading rusher. _ ‘ .

The project, spearheaded by Pitt head coach J ohrmy Majors, athletic
director Oval Jaynes and Pitt alurrmi came about after Majors’ retum
to Pitt three years ago and his amazement at ﬁnding the same facilities
that were there when he coached 20 years before. .

“For one thing, when I go back to Pitt and I look at the same facili-
ties that were there when I was there, I would say it would be pretty
hard to get quality athletes to come into an environment like that,”
Dorsett said. “And if you’re going to play the Penn States, Notre
Dames and the Michigans, you’ve got to be on the same level as them.
You’ve gotta have the same type of facilities.”

Jaynes said, “In terms of what has been completed so far, we are‘
comparable with any program in the country.” '

Phase 1 provides the expansion of gameday operations for the foot-
ball program. The phase, with a total cost amounting to $6.6 million,
placed new structural elements to support a new Level D at the ﬁeld

A new Gate.3 was created, and the old Gate 3 is now used as a load-
ing dock..

injured players from the football
ﬁeld.

Down the hall a little from the
restrooms lie Pitt’s humongous
weight room and the first ever
women’s locker room at Pitt
Stadium. The weight room, one
of the largest in college football, is
equipped with 85 pieces of
power-lifting machinery and over
eight tons of weights. The weight
room also has open windows and
a view of campus. A computer
located in the center of theroom
keeps track of each Panther’s
training progress.

“The weight room and rehab
areas are deﬁnitely in the top 10
in the country,” said sports infor-

mation intern Dave Ablauf.

During Pitt’s‘ glory days 20
years ago, the weight room
looked more like a garage, yet Pitt
continually produced standout
defensive and offensive linemen
such as Fralic, Chris Doleman
and Bill Maas. ‘

“There was a time when the
Pitt program was one of the most
prominent programs in the
nation,” Dorsett said. “And all of
a sudden it fell off, and when it
went down, it went way down.”

The weight room can also be
seen from Pitt Stadium’s main
gate, Gate 1. Gate 1 renovation is
included in Phase 8 of the Second

be put there for easier access to
the upper sections of the stadium.
There will also be room for retail
activities and a multi-purpose
room, as well as more room
around the ticket windows.

The renovations already com-
pleted dealt with only 35,000
square feet. The area is restricted
because of Pitt’s urban setting.

Phase 8’s projected cost stands
at $5,760,000. That, behind Phase
1’s $6.6 million cost, is the sec-
ond—most expensive phase in Pitt
Stadium’s rebuilding project.

On the other side of Pitt’s top-
ﬂight weight room is Pitt’s state-
of-the-art rehabilitation equip-
ment, put to good use by the num-
ber of injured Panther football
players this year. The training
room is three times larger than the
old one.

- The rehab area is open to all
Pitt athletes. Dr. Freddie Fu has an
ofﬁce there. Plus, there is a piece
of equipment for any imaginable
injured part of the body.

“Our rehab equipment is the
best rehab equipment,” said
Jaynes. “It is available to all our
student-athletes.”

The highlight of Pitt’s rehab
center, however, looks more like a‘
recreation area. Despite its
appearance, the hot tub can pro-
vide therapeutic comfort for up to
10 athletes at a time.

That’s not to mention the Swim
X. Pitt Stadium is one of six
places on college campuses
across the country to have such a
machine. A person climbs in and
swims against a current that keeps
the person in place. Undenieath
the Swim X is a viewing area for
doctors to watch the movement of
the swimmer and track therapy.

The Swim X, one of only two
such machines in Pittsburgh, is
also owned by 25 National
Football League teams and Pope
John Paul II.

“We wanted to have the most
modern equipment we could
have,” Jaynes said. “I would say
that this has been very positive in
the recruiting process.”

The new players’ entrance onto
the ﬁeld also was part of Phase 1.
The ﬁeld entrance is an electronic
door that has a sensor that will
automatically open when a person
passes under it.

Phase 1 of the Second Century
Fund is the key part of the plan in
recruitment, since these are the
facilities that future players will
use the most.

“There are also plans to build
locker rooms for the soccer teams
and other teams that use the stadi-
um,” Ablauf said.

elimination playoff system
which would start right after the
regular season ends. This elimi-
nates the argument that a play-
oﬁ’ would take too much time
for student-athletes. The maxi-
mum games played wou1d_be
three, and the loser would go to
the consolation bracket —
which would give a definite
one-through‘-eight ranking. And ,
the championship game would
still be played on New Year’s
Day.

For those unforttmate teams
that didn’t make the playoffs,
they’l1 play in the worthless
bowls. Because after all, we
don’t want those schools to
miss out on the real reason for
bowl games — money. Bowl
games create incredible rev-
enue, and in this scheme, every-
body makes out. The schools
are still taking in the cash, there
will be a deﬁnite No. 1 team

can have something more to
