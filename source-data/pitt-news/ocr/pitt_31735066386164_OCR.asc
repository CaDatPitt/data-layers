Craig Street Standoff ..

Gunrnan’s five—hour plea

By Karen D. Speece
Stajf Writer

Although Paul A. Fisher Jr.’s
arsenal of a riﬂe, a handgun and
over 300 bullets kept Pittsburgh
Police and North Oakland
residents at bay for five hours, it
soon became apparent this wasn’t
just a standoff, but a suicide vigil.

“He said, ‘Why aren't you
shooting me now? Go ahead,
shoot me.’ I’m afraid it was a no-
win situation,” Pittsburgh Police

Chief Mayer DeRoy said. “He
said he just wanted attention. He
stated that he didn’t mean to hurt
anyone.”

The stalemate ended at 5:05
p.m. when Fisher, 30, fired a .25-
caliber shot through his right
temple and fell off the parapet,

plummeting 16 stories amid the

cries of onlookers who had
gathered around the tower. Police
had allowed traffic to open at
approximately 4:15 p.m., when
Fisher surrendered his .22—ca1iber,
semi-automatic riﬂe to police. At
that point, police believed the
immediate danger to the public
had subsided. V

Students crowd into BAS events

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor
Poor attendance was one

problem the Black Action Society
did not have during this year's
Get Acquainted Weekend.

There weren’t enough chairs at
the Indaba; they had to turn
people away from the dance, and
rain forced them to crowd their
picnic indoors.

“I see many people standing in
the back. I’m glad to see a lack of
seating did not deter you,” said
BAS Chairperson Doug Ligons at
Friday night’s Indaba, an informal
discussion session, which
featured black—studies professor
Barbara Sizemore speaking on
“Black Self-Reliance.”

“The original Black Action
Society, the original founding
members who took over the
computer lab back in January ’69,
numbered not even half as many

students as we have here in this
room, and they effected a
significant change,” Ligons said.

The dance held after the Indaba
was “packed to capacity,”
according to BAS Deputy
Chairperson Marta Effinger. “We
couldn’t get any more people in
there. We had to turn people
away.”

“lAt] the first party, you get a
big draw,” said Vic Tarry, who,
along with Sekou Coleman, was
a disc jockey at the dance.

Get Acquainted Weekend
events were held in the William
Pitt Union.

“Many of us, myself included,
often come [to Pitt] with distorted
perceptions of how we got here,”
Ligons said at the Indaba. “We
think that we’re here because we
had the greatest parents in the
world or because we did well in
school, got good grades, high
[Scholastic Aptitude Test] scores

and the like. And the truth of the '

matter is very much the contrary, ”
he said.

“Back in the '60s and ’70s,
before students began to watch
and participate in the civil-rights
movement, you could have had
all these qualities and all these
resources that I listed behind you
and yet still couldn’t have gotten
into a major university,” he said.
“They just didn’t want African-
Americans on campus, and Pitt
was included.

“But these students, the on ginal
members of the Black Action
Society, went out on a limb to get
us in here, and it is up to us to
make the most of‘ the
opportunity,” he said.

Ligons introduced “the means
of getting the most out of Pitt,”
who were members of campus
organizations, including the

riﬂe. He still had the handgun; he
refused to surrender it. He then
cupped it around his head, and
of course, we knew what was
going to happen. Butwe couldn’t
get close because obviously had
we attempted to, he would have
jumped anyhow,” DeRoy said.
Fisher entered the William S.
Moorhead Tower, a complex for
handicapped and senior citizens

‘on North Craig Street, and scaled

a drainpipe to move from inside
the building to his position on
the edge of the parapet. DeRoy
said Fisher’s vantage point
hampered police efforts to bring
him down safely. .

“We couldn’t rush him because
we would either have been shot,
or he would have jumped. It
would have ended in tragedy,

and unfortunately it did end in
tragedy,” he said.

According to DeRoy, Fisher,
who lived on Bi gelow Boulevard,
wore a bright orange Day—Glo
cap, making him a more visible
target for police.

Although early reports called
Fisher a sniper, his semi—automatic
was recovered without a scope.
Police blocked off a six—block
area around Moorhead Tower
after Fisher began shooting at
approximately 11:50 a.m. “Before
[Fisher] fired any shots, he claimed
he was up there half an hour and
nobody was paying attention to
him. Of course when he started
to fire the weapon, he got all the
attention that was necessary,”
DeRoy said.

Novacor may revolutionize heart tloempy

Byjim Tezak
News Editor

Brian Williams walked out of
Presbyterian-University Hospital
in rnid-August as the first patient
with an implantable heart- assist
device to leave a hospital.

Now the University of
Pittsburgh is at the forefront of
what many hope will be a
revolutionary treatment for end-
stage heart disease. The National
Institutes of Health announced
last Thursday that Pitt, along with
St. Louis University in Missouri,
will receive a five—year, $1.6
million grant to develop a fully
implantable Novacor heart—assist
device. ‘

“The permanent devices will
probably revolutionize [treatment
of heart drseasel," said Steve
Winowich, a biomedical engineer
at Presbyterian—University
Hospital who has worked on the
Novacor project since June 1988.
“We think that it has an excellent

-chance of being a successful

According to Winowich,
each center will do 10 implants,
which must remain in the patients
for at least two years. First,
however, the present Novacor
system must be modified, and
candidates for implantation must
be screened. He said that actual
surgery is still probably two years
away.

If the program is successful, it
will provide a much—needed
alternative for those patients with
congestive heart failure. Currently
a patient’s only option is to get a
heart transplant. However,
Winowich said that the patients
on the transplant waiting list are
five times more numerous than
the available donor organs.
Twenty-ﬁve percent of those
waiting for a transplant will die
before an organ becomes
available, he said.

Winowich pointed out that
Novacor has several advantages
over artificial hearts, such as the
Jarvik, which requires the removal
of the patient’s own heart.

so it’s not as traumatic to a
patient’s system. It’s not a totally
artiﬁcial heart. In the case of
Novacor, your own heart is
actually working,” he said.

Nationwide, patients with
Jarvik hearts risk a greater chance
of infection, and ‘defects were
recently found in the Jarvik heart
that led to the federal government
banning its use, according to
Winowich.

Another advantage, Winowich
said, is that Novacor is powered
and driven electrically. The Jarvik
heart is electrically powered but
is driven pneumatically so an
external air supply is needed.

Novacor operates by giving
the heart left—ventricle support. A
tube is inserted about one and a
half inches into the left ventricle.
Blood flows through the tube
and is pumped into the aorta.

Winowich said that this system
can be modified so that it can be
permanently implanted.

Currently, as in Williams’ case,
N ovacor is used only as a “bridge”

stages of heart disease alive until
a donor organ becomes available
for a transplant.

Twenty Novacor implants have
been done at Pitt, more than at
any other center in the country,
according to Winowich. Patients
at Presbyterian-University
Hospital have spent 1,000 days
total on Novacor without , any
negative incidents related to the
devices.

Williams spent 121 days with a
Novacor implant before he was
transplanted on Aug. 28.
According to Winowich, Williams’
condition actually improved while
he was on the device.

W/hen Williams left Presby to
go to Family House on Neville
Street to await a donor organ, he
was riding an exercise bike and
lifting hand weights. According
to Winowich, Williams was
questioned by hospital personnel
several times when he used a
hospital elevator that was reserved
for patients only.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 10, 1990

Scholars say Soviets will support U.S. in Middle East

 

By Margaret Swisher
For the Pin News

Soviets will give President George Bush
moral and political support during the
Middle East crisis,,Soviet scholars told Pitt
faculty and students on Thursday.

“ Bush Will get [assistance] — absolutely,”
said Professor Alexis Vasiliev, the Middle
East adviser to President Mikhail Gorbachev
in Malta.

The colloquium, “The Transition of Soviet
Policy toward Iraq and Kuwait,” featured

two scholars from the Institute for African
Studies of the Academy of Sciences in the
USSR and was sponsored by Pitt’s Center
for Russian and East European Studies.

“We are friendly to the American policy,”
Vasiliev said. “We also want to get rid of
the regime of Saddam Hussein.”

Vasiliev was in disagreement with the

opinions others have of previous Soviet.

actions. “Voices are saying [to] stop
exporting arms to the Iraqis, but I disagree,”
Vasiliev said. “There are 15 major arms
exporters in the world, and if we hadn’t

given them arms, they would have
immediately gone to another country.”

Vasiliev also fears for the 200 Soviet
military technicians in Iraq. “If we pull
them out, we could be provoking an
unpredictable regime," Vasiliev said. “We
want to be cautious and maintain as low
a profile as possible.”

Professor Konstantin Trouevtsev was
also featured at the colloquium. T rouevtsev
has studied and written extensively about
Iraq, Kuwait and both parts of Yemen, but
said that current knowledge of the Middle

3

East isn’t sufficient to predict the Iraqis’
next move. G

“The Middle East crisis is more a matter
of speculation than calculation,” Trouevtsev
said.

He also spoke about the changing social
roles of women in the Middle East. “Women
entering the army is a revolution in itself,”
Trouevtsev said. “It is a great destabilization
factor.”

T rouevtsev concluded his predictions
about the Middle East by predicting

Studio CBS bigbligbts Campus Fest

By Donna Terrell
For The Pitt News

There was no frisbee throwing
or ball tossing, but the Bigelow
Lawn of the William Pitt Union
bustled with activity last Thursday.

The excitement was over
demonstrations, games and free
gifts — “Campus Fest ’90" — a
two—day, back—to—school festivity
featuring local and national
advertisers. .

Campus Fest, created by the
New Jersey-based Marketsource
Corp., is a marketing strategy
which allows companies“ to
personally advertise their
products to college consumers
while creating “an atmosphere of
fun, excitement and camaraderie,”
according to Campus Fest director
Chip Underhill.

The major attraction at Campus
Fest, which ran Sept. 6 and 7, was
Studio CBS, where students acted

out a scene from the daytime
soap opera “The Young and the
Restless” and received a free
videotape of their performance.

Rain on Friday forced the
festival into the ballroom of the
William Pitt Union, where there
was no room for a platform and
video equipment. Nevertheless,
Studio CBS managed to give away
50 videotapes on Thursday.

Marketsource representative
Chris Galli considers Studio CBS
a success, saying the participation
of 50 groups of students is average
for a school the size of the
University of Pittsburgh. Galli said
that the true measure of success
will be in the form of ratings,
since CBS hopes that acting out
a scene will get people to watch
the show.

IBM was another favorite
among Campus Fest-goers. The
company featured demon-
strations in an effort to “get

Michael Yurich, who represented -

IBM. The best part, according to
Yurich, was his being there to
answer questions and help
prospective buyers get “hands-

Calvin Klein Obsession, L’Oreal
and Sunshine Biscuits were
among major companies which
gave away free gifts and chances
to win prizes. There were
drawings for compact-disc
players, gift certificates and an
Isuzu automobile.

Junior Cary Page was left with
the impression that the university
is “into its students’ overall well-
being.” Pitt senior Rema Nassar
thought ‘the atmosphere was
beautiful, but she wished that
“you didn’t have to shoot a basket

“Our facilitator this evening is a

“The University of Pittsburgh is
not exactly user—free and user-

“The next was a problem that

they are not being addressed in

satisfies African-American
students,” she said.

“Your Black Action Society can
help you work out these problems
if you belong to it. If you felt that
it was necessary to solve these
problems, it would best beidone
with group action [rather] than by
individuals. There is always
greater strength in numbers,” she

after the takeover of the computer

of the black community who said,
‘For 300 years blacks and whites

it can be a little wimpish one that

“Keep in mind that the African-

the group, not to do the electric

Nobody would take
your dumb selfin there
with a 2.0,” she said.

“African—Amer—
ican organizations were
created to uplift the
group, not denigrate it.
And if we are letting
our organizations fall
apart, itis because there
is something wrong
with our commitment
to the collective,” she
said.

“So re—examine
what you do. Re-
examine what you want to do.
Re-examine what you think is
necessary for your success here
at the University of Pittsburgh,”
she said. “One thing I want you

 

to know for sure is that if you are
an African-American and you get

tough row to hoe.” —
“The Indaba was informative. I

Greaves said she liked “having

not just beneficial, it’s necessary,”
she said.

Freshman Duane Pettus said
he enjoyed the Indaba. “I had a

The BAS presented Sizemore

While many in the large crowd

speculated that he “was just

remembered him differently.

“I passed himon my way to

Dietz, 31, of North Craig Street. “I
said, ‘Hi, Paul.’ He said, ‘Hi, Dave.’
He was carrying a big bag. I see
him all the time. He’s a really
intelligent guy. He works with
computers. I just can’t believe
that’s him up there. I can’t believe
that he would hurt anybody.

“He was going to be called into
the reserves, but something
happened. He was real bummed
out about it,” Dietz said.

“He had a circle of friends. A lot
of people felt he had some kind
of problem,” said Mark Brown,
an Oakland resident and a friend
of Fisher’s. “He was going through
a period of unemployment. He
took some pride at being in the
Navy, [but] he was blowing off
weekend drills. His behavior had
been getting irrational.”

Rust unrelated to Roe. . .

The George Bush administration is once again attempting
to overturn Roe vs. Wade, this time through a case
unrelated to the 1973 Supreme Court case that allowed
women to terminate unwanted preganancies.

This time the weapon is the unlikely Rust»:/s. Sullivan,
which is arguing whether federally funded farnily—planning
clinics’ personnel should be prohibited from providing
information about abortion options to patients.

Supporters of this bill say that the government should
not have to spend its money on abortion counseling.
Critics contend that the law violates the free-speech rights
of both patients and clinic employees. ..

This case is an important one in its own right. The
simple fact that this case involves abortion does not make
it fair game to overturn Roe. If the Bush administration
considered the real issues of Rust rather than the issues
of Bush’s campaign speeches, it might better grasp the
fact that the two are unrelated. '

But Rust really has nothing to do with the 1973 ruling“
because of its very nature. The case is attempting to stop
discussions in farnily-planning concerning abortion, not
the fact of abortion. This is a case that should be handled
as a clarification of the First Amendment, namely free
speech. Roe is based on the right to privacy.

With the retirement of Supreme Court Justice William
Brennan, the court now has only three staunch advocates
of a woman’s right to choose. If Bush has his way, David

A Souter will be the next justice appointed, making five

opponents of Roe on the court. Justice Sandra Day
O’Connor, widely considered as a swing vote before
Brennan’s retirement, will become a non—factor in abortion

cases.

A brief released by the administration said, “We continue
to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should be
overruled.” But Bush is needlessly testing the court,
using any case concerning a facet of abortion to overturn
a Supreme Court ruling, even if the cases are not directly
related to Roe. He is, in fact, overlooking the important
First Amendment issues of Rust to place his own morality
on the women of America.

Mandela : true leader or rebel?

. When Nelson Mandela
walked out of Victor Verster
Prison several months ago, he
was greeted as a hero by the
entire world. Since then he has
embarked on a worldwide tour,
embracing David Dinkins in
New York City, getting standing
ovations in Congress and in
Canada’s House of Commons
and meeting with Margaret
Thatcher in London. His
popularity and inﬂuence are

far greater than that of many,

heads of state ——— proof of his
personal charm and integrity.

While there is a great deal to
admire in Mandela, he cannot
remain totally immune to
criticism if we are to formulate
a responsible South African
policy in this country. There
are a great many troubling
aspects of Mandela and his
African National Congress that
warrant our attention
immediately, considering the
major role he is playing in a
Changing South Africa.

Most disturbing of these is
Mandela’s continued belief in
Marxist theory and a socialist
economy. The ANC is closely
allied with Joe Slovo’s South
African Communist Party, with
25 of the 53 top leaders of the
ANC belonging to the Stalinist
organization. Together they
sponsor the Spear of the Nation,
a paramilitary organization
implicated in some of the most
brutal acts of terrorism ever
recorded. Mandela himself
speaks often of establishing a
“people’s democracy” through
nationalization of industry and

redistribution of wealth, all
hallmarks of Marxist political
thought.

It is hard to tell if Nelson
Mandela has any idea what true

democracy is. He defended the \

repressive regime of Kenyan
President Daniel Arap Moi by
stating that “black democracy is
not the same as white
democracy.” The “black
democracy” in Kenya he was
visiting at the time is a one-
party state that deals harshly
with political opponents. In
more publicized statements, he

Rob
Lewis

supported Fidel Castro,
Muammar Khadafy and Yasir
Arafat as principled men and
defenders of democracy. Such
statements make one wonder
about the uses the word
demo cracyis put to these days.

The ANC under Mandela prior
to and afterhis imprisonment
and in the interim under his
wife Winnie went to
extraordinary means to
eliminate black opposition to
its power. The self-appointed
representative of all blacks in
South Africa, the ANC has
employed numerous brutal
methods against rival groups in
the townships and in the state
of Natal — including the
infamous “necklacings” of
gasoline-ﬁlled tires that are then
set on fire. Winnie Mandela
herself has been implicated in

the beating death of 14+year—
old Stompie Seipei, a member

of her private bodyguard squad ‘

(ostensibly Mandela United
Football Team). Some sources
report that she participated in
the beating herself, although
this cannot be confirmed. It
should be remembered that
Nelson Mandela was
imprisoned in the first place for
blowing up several government
buildings after he unequivocally
rejected the non-violent
principles that guided such
other fighters of injustices as
Henry David Thoreau,
Mahatma Gandhi and Martin

V Luther King Jr.

I know of few in this country
who will defend apartheid in
South Africa. But opposition to
this policy need not mean that
we should totally support
Nelson Mandela or the African
National Congress, especially
when there are other
responsible black leaders in
the country. Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi of the Zulu tribe, for
one, recently founded the
Indaba movement: a multi-
racial party that advocates a
free market, an end to sanctions
and an end to all-white rule.
Chief Buthelezi often speaks of
a confederation of ethnic groups
in a democracy with protection
under the law for all, a system
that would surely beneﬁt South
Africa better than the totalitarian
socialism it risks with Nelson
Mandela and the ANC at the
helm.

Panthers finally defeat
Boston College at home

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

If you’re going to do it, you may as well do it right.
The Panthers overcame Boston College’s 1.0-year reign over Pitt

Stadium by tying a school record for interceptions, setting another ‘

for the longest punt in Pitt history, and stomping the Eagles 29-6 in
front of 35,409 fans on a glorious Saturday afternoon. ‘

The Panthers picked off six passes on the day, tying a school
record set, coincidentally, back at BC’s Alumni Stadium in 1977.
Strong safety Louis Riddick and free safety Doug Hetzler each had
two interceptions, and Hetzler ran one of his back for a 15-yard
touchdown in the third quarter to put the Panthers up 22-0.

“I was free to roam {on that playl, and I was just watching the
quarterback. I broke where he was looking, and he threw right at
me,” Hetzler said.

Both Willie Hicks, BC’s starting QB, and backup QB Glenn Foley
threw a few passes right into the hands of Pitt defenders. This was
more than a‘ case of sheer athletic ability on the part of the
defenders, for the coaching staff had done its homework thoroughly
in preparation for this game.

“Boston College has tended to do some of the same things in [its]
passing game over the past four or five years. We were in the right
defense at the right time, and that’s because the coaches knew what
to do,” Riddick said.

“Willie Hicks was running all over the place in the beginning of
the game. As long as the [defensive line] was chasing him around,
he wasn't going to throw too accurately. If you saw the first couple
of interceptions, they were thrown right to us, and that’s a credit to
the defensive line.”

Senior linebacker Craig Gob and game standout cornerback
Vernon Lewis accounted for the other two INTS.

Head coach Paul Hackett and special-teams coach Scott O’Brien

have been saying since the beginning of the year that special teams

Olanda Truitt is no longer concerned with catching 50 balls for 800-900 yards and 10 TD's.

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

Olanda Truitt boldly
announced his personal goals for
the 1990 season a month ago.

“The way things are looking,
I’d like to catch 50 balls this year,
maybe 800 to 900 yards, 10
touchdowns,” said Truitt at Pitt’s
Media Day, which celebrates the
start of fall camp.

Sure enough, now that the
season is under way, Truitt is on
target to reach those figures.
However, he see ms to have grown

a bit more hesitant to re—utter his,

chances of reaching those
numbers since that day.

“I’m not focused on those [goals
anymorel. My role is to contribute

to the team in any way I can, and

that means to catch every ball that
comes to me,” said T ruitt after the
Boston College game last
Saturday. “If at the end of the
year, that total comes up to 50
catches and 900 yards, then that’s
fine.” 1

It’s a good thing for Pitt Coach
Paul Hackett that Truitt’s talent is
a bit more consistent than his
modesty.

O.T., as his teammates call him,
had five catches for 10] yards in
the Panthers 29~6 win over the BC
Eagles last Saturday, including
four for 81 in the first half, before

Truitt redeﬁnes his previous goals during season

Coach Hackett went solely to the
running game to run out the clock.

For the season T ruitt now has
nine catches, 175 yards and 1 TD
in Pitt’s two games. Multiply those
numbers out over 12 games (1et’s
assume for a moment that Pitt
makes a bowl game), and you get
54 catches, 1,050 yards and six
TDS.

If he continues at that pace, the
first two numbers would be Pitt
records — Bryan Thomas also
had 54 catches in 1982, and Henry
_Tuten set the yardage record last
year with 975.

Although it’s only been two
games, and the opponents have
been Ohio University and Boston
College, Truitt has also shown
that he can perform in the big
game. He grabbed four catches

for 124 yards in Pitt’s 51-28 John ,

Hancock Bowl triumph last year.
Thus, in the three games where
Paul Hackett has been head coach,
T ruitt’s totals are up to 15 catches
and 299 yards, and Pitt is 5-0.
This year, Truitt’s yardage total
equals almost 50 percent of Pitt’s
receiving yards, and his five
catches accounted for five of Pitt’s
17 first downs against BC, two of
them coming on third down. Not
bad for someone whom the

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 10, 1990

There have been many of the press seemed to get a bit picture. Toner started his run up stands. Pitt players and coaches

arguments concerning the instant
replay in professional football.
Let me not bore you with them.

But maybe they should bring it
into college ball. Maybe they
should have television monitors
at Pitt Stadium, perhaps even
wide-screen television on the
sidelines so that players, coaches
and fans could witness a
questionable call by an official
over and over again.

If there is one aspect of any
sporting event that seems to linger
in people's minds, it is the endless
debate over “bad” calls and how
a team got hosed because of some
incompetent official.

Questionable calls seemed to
abound “this past Saturday at the
Pitt-Boston College game.
Coaches were screaming; fans
were in an u proar; even members

emotional at times.

Let me take you back 

Late in the first quarter, Boston
College started out first and 10 at
their own 2-yard line after a Scott
Stark 39-yard punt. Eagle fullback
Ed Toner ran off the left tackle
and was apparently dropped in
his own end zone for a safety. For
some reason, the officials didn’t
call a safety and placed the ball
on the l—yard line.

Pitt Stadium went nuts. The
Panthers sure looked like they
dropped him for a safety. In fact,
Toner was tackled about three
yards deep in his own end zone.
Heck, I thought it was a sure two
points for Pitt. How could that
idiot who was right on the play
miss such an easy call?

But thanks to television, the
instant replay showed a clearer

the middle and did in fact make it
all the way to the 1—yard line before
Ricardo McDonald and Charles

Williams dragged him back to the

 

Mike
Rampa

left side of the end zone.

Forward progress. Good call.
Chalk one up for the men in the
black and white.

On Pitt’s first drive in the second
quarter, Alex Van Pelt ran to the
left side and apparently dove into
the end zone for a touchdown.
But alas, the refs said no, that Van
Pelt stepped out of bounds at the
2-yard line. Again, mayhem in the

irate. But hey, they're not in the
press box with a television
monitor.

Van Pelt’s left foot did in fact
blatantly hit the sidelines. Not a
toe, not a heel, but his entire foot
was in the white. OB. Good call,
No. 2.

Same drive. Same player. Van
Pelt carried twice on a QB sneak
from the 1-yard line. Twice the
refs said no dice on the
touchdown. Pitt Coach Paul
Hackett was still a little miffed at
the post-game conference.

‘‘I’m impressed with myself
because I did maintain my cool
through a number of rather
remarkable calls,” he said. “How
a man could not call that a
touchdown the second time Alex
carried ...”

Now there is a valid point. Van
Pelt was lying in the end zone
with his waist on the goal line.
Since he is 6 feet 2 inches tall, that
means about three feet of him
was over the goal line. Well, the
prevailing guess was that his
forward progress was stopped
when the official blew the whistle;
maybe his knee touched the
ground before he was in. Who
knows?

The replay didn’t help. No one

guess what? That play was a
judgement call.” Ironic term, isn’t
it? A judgement left to people that
most players and fans wouldn’t
trust as far as they could throw
them. But it is a distinct right given
to officials. Now, guess what?
Everyone has to live with it.
Finally, in the second quarter,
Boston College faced a second-
and—nine situation from their own
2-yard line. Willie Hicks threw a
pass to tight end john Ragan,
which looked like an
incompletion because it was
caught so close to the turf. The

officials said it was complete;
everyone in the stadium
disagreed.

Enter instant replay. Ragan did
in fact scoop that ball just before
it hit the ground for a five-yard
gain.’

The plain fact of the matter is
this: None of those so-called
controversial calls had any real
impact on the game. As it turns
out, only one (V an Pelt’s negated
TD) was even questionable. If
this had been a big game, only
one call might have been wrong.
But that is pure speculation.

One questionable call in any
game? Worse things have
happened.

Continued from page 8
was going to take on a new
meaning this season. Pitt’s best
players have been manning the
lines on kickoffs, punts and
returns. However, the only things
those great players needed to do

‘for punter Brian Greenﬁeld on

Saturday was block.

On fourth and 13 from the Pitt
21-yard line, Greenfield hit a
perfect spiral bomb which didn’t
come to rest until it wound up in
BC’s end zone 79 yards away. The
kick is a new school record,
surpassing Larry Swider’s 77-yard
effort against Georgia Tech in

‘1976.

Hackett has also been saying
that the run would be the key to
the offense and success this year.
However, the running game was
far from successful on the
afternoon, especially in the early
stages. On Pitt’s first drive, Curvin
Richards and Glenn Deveaux ran
the ball a combined six times for

Tia net total of 12 yards.

Twice the Panthers were on the
BC 1—yard line and couldn't put
the ball in the end zone. In the
second quarter, Alex Van Pelt
carried three times, and tailback
Glenn Deveaux carried once from
the Eagle 3-, 2- and 1-yard lines,
but neither could come up with
the TD.

In the third quarter, Pitt’s first
drive began at the Eagle 2-yard
line. Deveaux carried twice,
netting a yard. Richards went
around the left end for no gain on

E;

third down, and Van Pelt threw
an incompletion to Olanda Truitt
in the end zone on the ensuing
play. Nothing doing.

“I don’t think that there's any
question offensively that our
football team is a long way away
from where we have to be, and I
think today showed it," Hackett
said.

“We are not what we were a
year ago in terms of [running]
straight ahead. I was terribly
disappointed with Curvin
Richards’ effort on the sweep — it
was run totally incorrectly,” he
added.

Richards ranthe sweep down
by the Eagles’ goal line and was
stopped for a_ short gain. When
asked about it, he said he didn’t
remember. But he did remember
some other things.

“I think most of it [today] was
my [fault]. The offensive line did a
great job blocking, but I wasn’t
making the right reads. 1 think I
was rushing a little bit out of the
backfield,” he said.

But if the running game was
slightly disappointing, Van Pelt’s
passing was right on target. He
connected on 18 of 26 passes for
181 yards and one interception.
Ironically enough, aside from
Hetzler’s score, Pitt’s other two
touchdowns came via the run, as
Deveaux and Richards scored in
the second and third quarters,
respectively.

However, Pitt’s drives were
fueled by the pass. T ruitt pulled

down ﬁve catches for 101 yards;
Richards caught three passes for
17 yards, and Hosea Heard caught
two for 20 yards. More
importantly, the passing game set

.up the run inside BC’s 20-yard

line and enabled the Panthers to
score.

“There’s no doubt in my mind
that we can pass,” Hackett said. “I
don’t think you win
championships passing. We’ve
got to run the football. And if we
run the football, then we’ll have a
chance against the people we
have to play this year.”

’ And Pitt has to play the mighty
Oklahoma Sooners this Saturday,
who beat UCLA this past weekend
34-14. Despite the shaky start of
his running game, Hackett is eager
to show the country what his
football team has —— on national
television.

Truitt’s totals would probably
be even higher, but Pitt’s two
games have both been blowouts,
and the Panthers have only
attempted a combined 13 passes
in the second half during the two
games. ‘

Hackett has said the running
game would be the weapon to
take Pitt to the promised land,
and not the much-heralded
passing of- Alex Van Pelt.
However, it was Pitt’s air show
that beat the Eagles on Saturday.

“We know we can throw the
football. I think you saw what
Olanda Truitt can do,” said
Hackett after the BC win. “Now if
we can just run the football, we’ll
have a chance."

Truitt was an all-state selection
at A.H. Parker in Birmingham,
Ala.., and he said that he received
interest from Pitt, Louisville,
Florida, Miami, UCLA and the
entire SEC. But when it came
down to signing time, it was only
Pitt and Louisville that Truitt

“I liked the atmosphere here —
the coaches really impressed me,”
said Truitt. I

“Olanda is the type of person
you love to coach because he has

a great work ethic,” said wide—_

receiver coach Skip Peete. “Every
time he steps on the field, he is
going to give you 110 percent.”

Truitt’s forte is to catch the ball
and turn upfield to gain more
yardage, and he models himself
after the San Francisco 49ers’John
Taylor and Jerry Rice in that vein.

He also possesses an incredible
jumping ability which allows him
to sky above defenders to pull
down passes. .In high school,
T ruitt qualified for the state track
and field championships in four
events and has high-jumped 6
feet 4 inches and long jumped 21
feet 11 1/2 inches.

Truitt’s ability has gotten him
off to a fast start which could land
his name in Pitt’s record books
before too long — no matter how
modest he gets.

defense in the draft, using their
first four picks on defensive
players. Coach Jim Mora believes
that defensive. linemen Renaldo
Turnbull and Joel Smeenge will
improve a defensive line that
needs to put more heat on the
passer. Defensive back Vince
Buck will see some playing time.

Both teams will try to establish
the running game tonight. The
Saints feature running back Dalton
Hilliard. He gained 1,262 yards
last year and scored a league-
high 18 touchdowns. He
possesses incredible balance and
tremendous leg strength. Craig
Heyward has to improve his
intensity level. He can be brilliant
on one play and blow an
assignment on the next.

The 49ers had problems
running the football throughout
the preseason. The offensive line
has been juggled around, mostly
because of holdouts. If the line
can gel quickly, Roger Craig and
Tom Rathman will be traveling
over a lot of real estate. Some

people feel that Craig has lost a I‘

a factor as some might think.
Craig's role has been reduced.
Rathman has taken over a big
chunk of the receiving and
blocking duties, while Dexter

situations. It is essential for the
49ers to be able to run the ball so
that teams can not just sit back in
deep zones waiting for Jerry Rice
and John Taylor.

If the Saints can keep Montana
and Co. off the field by’
establishing the run, they can" win

tonight’s game. They will also go

after left cornerback Darryl
Pollard. He has been exploited at
times. Defensively, the Saints must
generate a strong inside pass-rush
and get in Montana’s face. It is
hard to-get to Montana from the
outside when he takes the three-
step drop. Cornerbacks Robert
Massey and Toi Cook will have
their handsfull with receivers Rice

and Taylor. It is important for them i

not to miss tackles so that Rice
and Taylor do not do V more
damage after the catch.

The 49ers simply have to be the

49ers, and they will win the game. A

Don Griffin and Pollard have to
play solid man-to—man defense
on receivers Eric Martin and
Perriman, so that the linebackers

can concentrate on shutting down '

Hilliard. San Francisco must also
neutralize the pass rush of outside
linebacker Pat Swilling. A good
night by Craig would be a plus.

Look for a hard—hitting, exciting A

game tonight. The Saints are not
the Broncos. This will" be a close
one, with the ‘Niners taking their
