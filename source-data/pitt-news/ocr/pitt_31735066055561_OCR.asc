PH! fraternity wins national award

Erin Lindeman
Senior Staff Wrlter

A video about responsible party-
ing, dealing with fights and helping
rape victims was part of a risk—man-
agement program now being used-by
fraternities across the country.

The Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity

' video teaches how to safely escort an

intoxicated person home. It also
shows the potential dangers of a party,
such as illegal drugs, beer bottles,
kegs and beer games, and teaches the
proper way to sign guests in and out of
a party.

“Whether a party is dry or wet,
fraternities and sororities alike need to
know how to reduce the risk of prob-
lems,” said AEPi President Eric
Frank.

AEPi’s national Director of Risk
Management, Scott Cohen, awarded
Pitt’s chapter first place at AEPi’s
International Convention, which was
held in August in Atlanta. The chapter
beat out- 19 applicants from across
North America.

Frank accepted the award on
behalf of Pitt’s entire chapter during
the Annual Foundation Luncheon..

Frank said during the convention
other fraternity presidents from
around the nation expressed an inter-
est in borrowing the video to show
their fraternity brothers. g .

“I had heard great things [about
the video] from Kerry Daley,” Cohen
said. “They had done an all-around
excellent job of risk management and
risk reduction on campus.” .

Daley, Pitt’s Greek adviser, wrote

the fraternity a letter of recommenda-
tion to submit along with its applica-
tion.

Mike Levinstein, last year’s AEPi
president, developed the concept of
the video.

“I wanted to leave something on

campus before I was done with my
office,” Levinstein said.

Pitt’s Alpha Epsilon Pi chapter,
produced the video with assistance
from Theta Chi fraternity and Delta
Delta Delta sorority.

The video is a mock party held at

Pitt’s Alpha Epsifon Pi Fraternity
won nationaf attention with its
risfc.-management program and
video.

the AEPi house. The three Greek orga-
nizations involved in the project set up
scenarios in which they broke
Interfraternity Council guidelines.

During a seminar involving Pitt
Greeks, the presidents were asked to
write down all of the guide lines they
saw broken in the video. According to
Levinstein, there were between 20 and
30 in the movie, and no president rec-
ognized all of them.

For the chapter to win the award,
it had to excel in reducing risks on-
campus and must have participated in
risk—reduction programs within the
past 16 to 18 months.

AEPi’s risk—management program
consisted of two seminars. One was
held on—campus last fall, and because
it was so successful, Frank was invit-
ed to the AEPi President’s Convention
to present its program and video.

“The initiative they [AEPi] took
was excellent,” said Daley.

Daley noted the importance of the
video, saying it shows college stu-
dents who are plagued with substance
abuse issues and also teaches the audi-
ence how to “party smart.”

“[This fraternity’s accomplish-
ments] have been excellent,” said
Daley. “Both locally and nationally
the leaders I’ve dealt with in the past
few years have been good representa-
tives of the entire Greek community.”

Pitt’s AEPi chapter was awarded a
cash prize of $500, a plaque and a 20
percent reduction on its liability insur-
ance premium.

Cohen said the chapter was select-
ed for its all-around risk—management
program.

Pih‘ may narrow gap between values of B+ and A-

Jason Galllnger
Asslstant News Edltor

A student government committee
has been working on a proposal to
increase the value of A+ grades since
the spring.

To see how many quality points
other universities award for A+’s, the
Academic Affairs Committee requested
copies of the grading scales of the 60

- schools in the Association of American

Universities, to which Pitt belongs.

A majority of the universities that
have responded to date assign four
quality points to both A’s and A+’s, as
Pitt currently does. However, most of

those responding schools assign more
points to B+ grades than Pitt.

Now it seems that if any grade will
increase in value, it will be the B+,
allowing Pitt to bring its grading scale
more in line with those of other AAU
schools and to reduce a large disparity
between an A- and a B+.

Under the earlier proposal, A+
grades would rise to 4.25 quality points.
Only 10 of the 30 universities that have
sent copies of their grading scales
assign more than four points to an A+.

On the other hand, 28 of the 30
responding schools give 3.33 quality
points for a B+, as opposed to the 3.25
points Pitt gives.

Only Carnegie Mellon University
and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology offered something other
than 3.33 points for a B+. Other schools
responding so far - include Yale,
Michigan State, Tulane and Duke.

George Mongell, the chairman of
the Academic Affairs Committee, said
he is waiting for the remaining univer-
sities to send their grading scales before
he can say with certainty which, if any,
grade might be given a higher value.

Frederick Koloc, director of advis-
ing for the College of Arts and
Sciences, said he did not see any down-
side to raising the value of a B+.

“I certainly see nothing wrong with

that if it helps give a student a boost in
his QP ,” Koloc said. “It’s going in the
right direction.”

Koloc has also endorsed raising the
value of A+’s.

Overall, A+ grades are a glaring
minority. CAS handed out 52,658
grades in the spring semester. Only
1,820 of those, or 3.46 percent, were
A+’s.

Mongell said that while increasing
the value of an A+ would benefit stu-
dents who excel, there is no pressing
need to do so.

“This is a project that a lot of stu-

The Taste That

For The Pitt News

After excelling in its first four
tournaments this semester, the
William Pitt Debating Union is now
ranked fifth in the nation.

‘The team and its coaches are
looking forward to continuing their
debating activities in intercollegiate
policy debate competition and public
debate this year. Beating out such
top-ranked debate teams as Cornell
and Northwestern leaves the team
looking forward to what the year will

- bring. 4 \

Junior Lisa Corrigan stomped her
way through the first tournament of
the year at King’s College in Wilkes-
Barre, Pa., in September. Corrigan
was voted the best speaker out of the
54 debaters in the varsity division.

The team of Corrigan and sopho-
more Phil Elwood soared to the top
of the team rankings, placing second
overall. They won five out of six pre-
liminary rounds and beat the touma-
ment-winning Cornell team in the
final round.

“You rarely see that kind of dom-
ination of one team in a tournament.
It was very impressive,” said Gordon
Mitchell, an assistant professor and
the director of debate.

Junior Brendan Delaney also
shone at the tournament, capturing
sixth place in the varsity division.

In the novice division at King’s,
first-year students Laura Hutchings
and Heather Logue made their debut
in style. As a team, they won seven
out of their 10 rounds and advanced
all the way to the final round.

Another novice team of first—year
students excelled at the tournament.
Melissa Montenes and Denise Olczak
argued their wa’ into the elimination
rourds, stepping over the Navy team.

Freshman Claire Fehsenfeld
dominated the tournament at the
University of Richmond last week-
end. She rose to fourth place in the
varsity division.

Fehsenfeld and partner Andrew
Stangl claimed third place in the
overall varsity team rankings.

Mitchell said he is especially
pleased with Fehsenfeld’s perfor-
mance, as the tournament at
Richmond was only her second colle-
giate debating competition.

Stangl was also ranked as the
seventh varsity speaker, and Carrie
Weletz captured ninth place.

he said.

What is more of a concern, he said,
is the gap between the )A— and B+. At
present, an A— counts for 3.75 quality
points, and a B+ counts for 3.25, twice
the difference between other grades. A
B counts for 3 quality points, and a B-
counts for 2.75. Raising the B+ to 3.33
points would narrow the difference.

Although there was some discus-
sion about making the A+ point change
retroactive, that issue has not yet been
discussed with regard to the B+.

While Koloc said he had not really
thought about the gap between A—’s and
B+’s in the past, he agreed that the dif-

ference is significant and that raising
the value of a B+ would make the dif-
ference more equitable.

Whenever discussion of increasing
the value of a grade has come up, so,
too, has the issue of grade inﬂation.

Koloc said he does not see where
grade inﬂation would come from as
long as faculty make a good faith effort
to give students grades they deserve.
Faculty, he said, should have a straight-
forward grading policy that would
inform students of the criteria for each
grade.

“A B+ should be an accurate reﬂec—
tion of a student’s work,” he said.

Koloc added that he knows the Pitt
administration puts a lot of stock in
what the other AAU schools do and
said he would not be surprised to see
the University increase the B+ value.

Once Mongell has received the ‘

grading policies of all AAU schools, he
will present his findings to Beverly
Harris—Schenz, CAS’ associate dean for
undergraduate studies, who will review
the data and decide if the proposal
should proceed to higher administra-
tion. The ultimate decision will be
made by the Faculty Council or the
board of trustees.

statement that this year, Pittsburgh
has a full complement of extremely
powerful and talented speakers,” said
Mitchell.

The team attended two other
tournaments earlier this month, in
Columbia, S.C., and Lexington, Ky.

With six new William Pitt
Debating Union scholarship recipi-
ents on the team, Mitchell and his
fellow coaches are looking forward
to a stellar year. He describes the
new members as “top-notch” stu—
dents and debaters, as they all are
recipients of University scholarships
and eligible for the Honors College.

Another addition to the team is
coach and graduate assistant Marcy
Halpin from DePaul University.

With key debaters and coaches in
place, the team is turning its atten-
tion toward preparation for national
policy debate competition.

The topic for this year’s national
intercollegiate policy debate is
“Resolved: That the United States
federal government should amend
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, through legislation, to create
additional protections against racial
and/or gender—based discrimination.”

The Debating Union will com-
pete at a tournament at Duquesne

Michigan death echoes others across the nation

Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud

Mlchlgan Dally

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (U-WIRE) —
The tragic death of ﬁrst-year student
Courtney Cantor last Friday morning is
the latest tale of sorrow in a national out-
break of recent tragic accidents on col-
lege campuses.

In an eerily similar incident last
Thursday, Rosamond Huntoon, a sopho-
more at Colby College in Waterville,
Maine, plunged three stories from her
residence hall room window. She
remains hospitalized in critical but sta-
ble condition.

Another Colby student has been
charged with furnishing Huntoon, a
minor, with a place to consume alcohol.

One in three college students drink
to become intoxicated, according to lit-
erature from Mothers Against Drunk
Driving. In addition, 42 percent of col-
lege students reported they had partici-
pated in binge drinking — deﬁned as
ﬁve or more drinks at one time.

Stanford University student Michael
Howard’s recent behavior is apparently
consistent with that statistic. He

-emerged from a coma yesterday after

dropping from the balcony of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity house in Palo
Alto, Calif., on Oct. 10.

Howard, a Phi Delta Theta fraterni-
ty member, reportedly had consumed
alcohol, which contributed to the 20-foot
fall.

p Stanford ofﬁcials emphasized that
the recent incident
was uncommon and

nity, which had been

Cantor’s death “was an odd inci-
dent, but it could have happened to a lot
of students in a bunch of different
ways,” Hartford said. “We had a lot of
students out drinking that night.”

While Howard escaped death, oth-
ers were not so lucky. Rutgers
University student Jason Greco died
Oct. 11, three days
after falling down a

Theta Chi fraternity

university before. Brunswick, N.J., the

for Student Affairs .

ing in a local bar and
reportedly was intox-
icated.

In a statement
released last
Tuesday, Rutgers President Francis
Lawrence called the death “a tragic loss
to his family and to the entire Rutgers
community.

“It is wrong by every sense of right
that we possess  when we see death
come to a college campus,” Lawrence

wrote. “Such a thing simply should not I

happen.”
The consequences of alcohol-related

deaths can be exacting for fraternities.

Last month, the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity at Louisiana State
University pled no contest to 86 criminal
charges in connection with the death of
LSU student Benjamin Wynne, the LSU
Reveille reported.

Wynne died Aug. 26, 1997, from
acute alcohol poisoning. Tests later
showed Wynne’s blood—alcohol level to
be .588 and revealed traces of drugs in
his system.

At Syracuse University in Syracuse,
N.Y., the local chapter of Sigma Chi fra-
ternity was suspended after a student
became dangerously intoxicated Sept.
24 when he was given a bid for the orga-
nization and taken out drinking with
brothers.

Hartford expressed worry that many
students will not learn from the death of
Cantor.

“There were a lot of people in pain
today,” Hartford said. “My concern is
that people won’t connect that grief
when they go out drinking the next
time.”

Playboy survey: more virgins in college

Nada El Sawy

Dally Trojan

LOS ANGELES, Calif. (U-WIRE)
—— Less sex, more virgins. This seems to
be the trend in sexual attitudes among
undergraduates on American college cam-
puses, according to a recent survey con-
ducted by Playboy magazine.

The editors announced a surprising
increasein the percentage of virgins and
students in monogamous relationships on
Oct. 7 at a press conference at Playboy’s
New York headquarters.

Although it is unclear whether USC
students have experienced the same shifts,
a similar survey is conducted on campus
every two to three years.

The “Youth Risk Behavior Survey”
was last taken in 1995. Another survey is
scheduled to be mailed later this year. It
will consist of multiple—choice questions
addressing issues of sexuality, as well as
nutrition, exercise, smoking, drugs and
alcohol.

Questions about sexuality included
“In the past 30 days, how often have you
had intercourse?” and “How many times
have you had sexual intercourse in a life-
time?”

According to the 1995 statistics, about
33 percent of women on campus have
been pregnant sometime in their lives.
Only 23.2 percent of students at USC have
never had sex. In comparison to other uni-

versities, Celina Gorre, a health educator
at Health Promotion and Prevention
Services, said that USC is “pretty on par.”

“We’re certainly not lower, but not
much higher,” she said

However, the number of people who
have had sex is hard to say.

“People can deﬁne themselves as vir-
gins, but what does
that mean?” Gorre
said.

She said that
some students may
consider themselves
virgins because they
have never had sex
sober.

The survey origi-
nally started in the
1970s, but was
stopped until the editor
decided to start it again
in 1996. Since the
1996 survey, the per-
centage of students
who are virgins has
doubled. Of the stu-
dents who identiﬁed
themselves as virgins, men said they had-
n’t foimd the right person and women said
they were saving themselves for marriage.

Playboy used the convenience sample
method, surveying more than 2,000 stu-
dents at seven large and small, public and
private schools in California, Oklahoma,

He Said

Mississippi, Louisiana, Pennsylvania,
Michigan and New York The names of
the schools were not mentioned.

Students, unaware that these surveys
were for Playboy, were asked 86 questions
and 10 essay questions about their sexual
activities. The 1996 questionnaire asked
152 questions and 10 essay questions.

Results of the
biarmual survey are
featured in the
November issue of
Playboy, now on sale.
Some of the notable
ﬁgures include the per-
centage of students
who have had sex with
only one person in the
past school year: 54
percent of men and 70
percent of women.

Based on the
survey, students
seemed less concerned
about AIDS, Playboy
reported. In 1996, 39
percent of men and 35
percent of women had
taken the AIDS test. The numbers have
dropped this year to 26 percent of men and
29 percent of women.

Playboy deﬁned being a “virgin” as
not having had sexual intercourse. The
deﬁnition does not include oral sex.

Bruce Cohen, the spokesman for

Playboy, said that this was the attitude of
the students surveyed, and the interpreta-
tion has remained relatively constant.
“The deﬁnition hasn’t changed in
decades,” he said
Some students at USC felt that this
ignored the consequences oral sex brings.
“In terms of disease, both situations
should be considered,” said Scott Smith, a
sophomore majoring in cinerna-television.
Gorre said the survey’s shift in sexual
attitudes could be explained by students’
abilities to rationalize their actions. People
tend to think that if they love a certain per-
son, or if they choose their partners well,
then they are not at risk, she said.
Another misconception is that college
provides a sheltered environment from

- sexually transmitted diseases.

“STDs are more prevalent in college
campuses than among those who didn’t go
to college,” Gorre said

The socioeconomic status of many
students at USC lead to the misconception
of being safe. The survey’s decreased
number of students testing for AIDS prob-
ably reﬂects that, Gorre said.

“People probably don’t know that
person’s sexual history,” said Crystal
Murphy, an undeclared freshman. “They
could be cheating on them; they could be
hiding something from them.”

“When you sleep with someone, you
have slept with everyone they have slept
with,” Cohen said

L

Gulf between B+ and A- needs
to be reduced

Student Government’s
Academic Affairs Committee
has proposed that Pitt raise the
value of a B+ grade.

A boost in the quality points
(from the current 3.25 for a B+
to the proposed 3.33) can only
benefit students. Though it does
represent grade inﬂation (a trend
which some analysts call dis-
turbing — note their concerns
withinflation in SAT scores that
have occurred alongside an
apparent decline in the quality of
education), it could not possibly
undermine Pitt’s academic
integrity. »

As long as professors give
out grades fairly and have a
straightforward grading policy
in their classes, there won’t be
any problems with grade inﬂa-
tion. . ,

An increase in the quality
points assigned to the B+ would
bring Pitt in line with the other
59 colleges in the Association of

A American Universities. .It would

also help reduce the large dispar-
ity that currently exists between
the B+ and the A- (3.75).

Right now, Pitt students
receiving B+s are in essence get-
ting lower quality points for that
particular grade than students
from other colleges receiving a

B+. If a student has been consis-
tently getting B+s at Pitt, that
student’s QPA would be in the
region of 3.25. But students
from the 28 of the 30 AAU
schools that sent their grading
policies to the Academic Affairs
Committee with the same
amount of B+s will have a
slightly higher GPA.

Since the proposal is still in
its infancy, discussions as to
whether the B+ adjustment
should be retroactive or not have
not been held. If this proposal is
passed by the Faculty Council or
the Board of Trustees when it is

2 presented to them, the retroac-

tion should be taken into
account. ”
As well as having a grading
scale that matches other AAU
colleges, the increase in the
value of the B+ would greatly
help students with scholarships.
To keep scholarships or grants,
students have to maintain a cer-
tain QPA (usually in the range of
3.0 and above). Since a B+ is not
so far behind an A- as grades go,
the gulf between them quantita-
tively should not be so large.
The disparity between B+
and A- grades should be made
smaller. A 0.08 increase in the
value of the B+ is the way to go.

Pinochet’s role shouldnot be that of scapegoat

I was visiting relatives in Santiago, Chile,
some years ago when I passed by Augusto
Pinochet’s residence (so my aunt informed
me) and was surprised to ﬁnd a plain, upper
rniddle-class house where I expected a gaudy
mansion. This minor observation further rein-
forced my evolving belief that Pinochet
abused his dictatorial powers less than the
typical authoritarian head of state. In the
course of several visits to my birthplace, I
have witnessed Chile’s astonishing progress
since Pinochet relinquished power, and I have
some thoughts inspired by the recent arrest of
the former military dictator in London on
Spanish charges of crimes against humanity.

Under Pinochet’s regime, several thou-
sand people were murdered, for political
motives — estimates tend to converge around
3,000. There is no doubt the regime enforced
political repression — anti—communism espe-
cially was a top priority for
Pinochet.

My aim is not to justify the
regime, let alone to excuse the
murders. However, the repression
should be placed in the appropriate
context, and Pinochet’s culpability should be
measured against what he in fact knew - how
violent his repression was relative to the
repression of other dictators (i.e. just how
contemptible was his regime?) and how Chile
developed under his rule.

J

Chile was in an economic crisis in 1973,

the year of the coup. Much of the crisis must
be blamed on the policies of Salvador
Allende, who, in spite of winning the presi-
dential election with a minority of votes,
charged ahead with an ambitious socialist
program that soon paralyzed the economy. It
was not just business interests and the upper
class but also the middle class who placed
pressure on the military to intervene. I’m
tempted to call the coup an expression of the
general will.

Pinochet took control and established
order, as people with the military mentality
tend to do. The military mind has little under-
standing of dissent —— it thinks that an ideo-
logical impasse is dealt with through violence.
It must be said that such intolerance was mir-
rored by communists, and, indeed, leftists
generally did not refrain from violence toward

the accomplishment of their political objec-
tives in Chile. The soldiers killed more com-
munists than vice versa because, after all, sol-
diers are expert killers (while communists are
more often expert propagandists, perhaps).
The least defense of Pinochet’s repres-
sion is that it was signiﬁcantly less horriﬁc
than the repression of other dictators. If one
were to construct a gruesome list of state mur-
ders by regime, there would be few in which
the statistic falls below 10,000. Franco, to

How many citizens died under our very own
Abraham Lincoln? Pinochet’s repression sim-
ply does not compare in magnitude against
the horrors of most dictatorial regimes, and it
is likely that much of the hatred directed at
Pinochet is strongly connected to his consis-
tent anti—communism. That those who con-
demn Pinochet are less likely to
‘ condemn, say, Castro, bolsters the
latter claim.
There is, too, the disturbing

leading the country along the road to social-
ism? Given the examples of other countries
who experimented with strict central plan-
ning, it would not be unsafe to say that Chile
might be in ﬁnancial ruin and social chaos
today instead of being stable and relatively
prosperous. Would more people have died
and suffered had Allende not been deposed?
Perhaps Pinochet’s preemptive action averted
a civil war. But such thinking is too specula-
tive, I admit

Pinochet should not be remembered
fondly. However, in a potentially catastrophic
situation, his actions yielded a consequent his-
tory less morally repugnant than other imag-
inable and plausible possibilities. This is a
thoroughly ambivalent opinion, but any opin-
ion less ambivalent cannot reﬂect” accurately
what is a genuinely problematic situation. The
murders of thousands should not be excused;
but Pinochet should not be a scapegoat, lest a
supposedly legitimate system of justice once
again be used for illegitimate ends.

I. Gielata wonders if Pinochet has ever read
Isabel Allende ’s novels.

Lisa Inﬁeld
Columnlst

I was shocked to see the Oct 6 Pitt
News cover story, “Alcohol barmed in dorms
as Pitt tries to end abuse.”

Whether or not one supports the drink-
ing age of 21, we have a designation by law
that tells us when people are old enough and
responsible enough to drink. The University
should not restrict people of legal age from

, drinking responsibly.

It may have the power to do so, but that
does not make its decision right. Are Towers
AandB andAmosHalltheﬁrstofmany or
theonlythreeresidencehallsthatwillbe
designated alcohol—free? What if the
University extends this to Lothrop,
Sutherland and others?

There are many 21-year-old students
who liveoncampus. Despitethemany prob-
lems with campus life, it is simply easier and

THE P111 Nraws: OPINIONS

Keeping alcohol in dorms does not

encourage vomiting in the bathrooms or
noisiness in the hall (problems the
University wants to avoid). It simply allows
people who choose to live on campus some
of the freedoms they
would have in an off-
campus apartment.
The law says these
people have to the
right to drink and can
handle it.

In fact, this new
ban may actually
encourage strange
drinking habits. If
someone who lives
on campus wants to
drink some wine, he
or she would have to go the liquor store, buy
thewine,ﬁndsomeplacetodrinkit,andﬁn-
ishthewholebottle.Thisisanextremecase,
I realize — most people have off—campus
friends. Nevenheless, it is a real possibility.

On another note, let’s talk about Amos

I am certain the University is not assum-

sororities have more

Size doesn’t
matter

How could anyone not root for Doug
Flutie?

The current Buffalo Bills quarterback
started building his huge fan club some 13
years ago, when he was scrambling
around in the backfield of Boston
College.

He wasn’t the biggest, and he sure
wasn’t the strongest. But at 5-10 and 170
pounds, he put up mammoth passing
numbers.

In his four years at BC, Flutie threw
for a staggering 10,579 yards and 67
touchdowns. I

The miniature quarterback is proba-
bly best remembered for his dramatic,
last-second “Hail Mary” pass to beat
Miami in 1984.

Flutie’s scrappy playing style and his
blue-collar work ethic carried Boston
College to three postseason bowl appear-
ances, including the 1984 Cotton Bowl, in
which the Boston College Eagles beat
Houston 45-28. '

The gutsy little quarterback’s popu-
larity skyrocketed, and he won the 1984
Heisman Trophy. '

But once his decorated college career
ended, something perplexing happened.
Flutie lasted until the 11th round of the
1985 NFL draft, until he was ﬁnally
selected by the Los Angeles Rams.

How could 284 other players be
selected before the best college football
player in the country?

The answer is easy: his size.

The NFL only likes players with pro-
totypical NFL size, and with Flutie’s small
stature, every team in the league passed
him up thinking he was too small to play.
9 This is a rediculous practice that has
existed in the NFL for years and is still
prominent today.

If a guy can play, and especially if he
can win, what difference does it make
how big he is?

Flutie never made the team with the
Rams, they cut him in training camp.

He signed on with the Chicago Bears
that same year and ended up winning a
Super Bowl ring  as a backup to starting
quarterback Jim McMahon.

Over the next four years, Flutie
played sparingly for the Bears and later
the New England Patriots, but rarely got
an honest chance to play. When he did, he
made the most of it, going 9-5 as a starter
(on some pretty bad teams) during his
ﬁrst NFL stint.

After the 1989 season, Flutie went to
the Canadian Football League, in which
he excelled for eight years.

Panthers out-S-duked at invitational

“Disappointment” is word that has
been used quite a bit lately to describe
Pitt sports. This weekend’s performance
by the Panther men’s and women’s cross-
country teams at the Duquesne
Invitational was no different.

The women ﬁnished third out of 11
teams overall and second among
Division I teams, while the men ﬁnished
eighth overall out of 12 teams, fourth
among Division I teams.

Despite strong ﬁnishes by Wendy
Larnpart and Lauren Fittz —- who placed
fourth and sixth, respectively —— coach
Dave Sobal was less than satisﬁed.

“I’m more than a little disappointed.
We had beaten Duquesne a week before,
so I don’t understand what happened,”
said Sobal.

In fact, the Pitt women were 2-0
against the Lady Dukes coming into the
meet, and they expected to be undefeated
afterward as well.

“We need to have ﬁve or six people
to pull through each and every week, and
unfortunately, that hasn’t happened,”
said Sobal.

The men’s team would like to have
that many people just to compete. The
men seem to scramble every week to ﬁnd
six runners, and it’s even harder to find
six cross-country runners. The sixth run-
ner this weekend was Brian Johnson,
who is primarily a decathlete.

“It’s going to [require] a bunch more
men to do well, and it doesn’t help when

‘ only three out six guys run fairly tough,”

said Sobal.

That’s an understatement, consider-
ing that Pitt’s best runner, Mike
Orzechowsi, was feeling ill all weekend
and still managed to ﬁnish third among
the Pitt men.

“Men’s cross-country is in a situation
where it’s counting on quality individuals
to come in and walk on,” said Sobal.

The times at the invitational were
relatively slow. According to Sobal, only
a few people ran better times than they
did last year.

“We’re trying to ﬁgure out the slow
times, not only internally, but all of the
coaches whose teams participated in the
invitational don’t know what happened.”

Both the men and women will have a

Walk-on Ponko proving he's worth a chance

Mario Machi
Staff Wrlter

All Mark Ponko wanted was a chance.

Now that the Pitt football coaching staff
has given him a chance, Ponko is proving his
worth to the team. This year, the redshirt
freshman from Franklin Regional High
School in Delmont, Pa, has made immedi-
ate contributions to special teams, as well as
in the secondary.

Ponko had scholarship offers from a
few Division 11 schools, but he decided to try
to walk on to Walt Harris’ Panther squad.

“I had no guarantees when I came here.
Ijusthadtoworkhardandirnproveinorder
to earn a spot here,” Ponko said

Ponko was one of the most highly
regarded defensive backs in the Western
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic
League during his senior year at Franklin
Regional, but he came to the Pitt largely
unknown and was redshirted last season.

Anyone who watches a Panther practice
can see how much Ponko’s teammates
respect him Special teams coach Brian
Wrlliarns said that Ponko’s work ethic is the
key to his success.

‘Mark is very aggressive and disci-
plined We knew coming into the season that
he would have some role on our special

teams, based on the way he practiced last
year and during the spring.”

According to defensive backs coach
Bill McGovern, Ponko is “an aggressive
young player who likes to practice. I wish
everyone on the team was as eager as him.
He had a good spring for us, and he has done
everything we asked of him He gains more
knowledge of our schemes every day.”

Ponko is still a walk-on at Pitt, but there
is a chance that he will be offered a scholar-
ship before next season. Such an offer will
most likely depend on whom the Panthers
recruit and how many scholarships are avail-
able. But his coaches agreed that Ponko
should get some consideration.

Williams remarked, “I wish we had a
thousand guys like Mark Ponko. The size of
his heart is carrying him here.”

Wrlliarns went on to explain that on
Sunday nights, the team gets together to
watch ﬁlm of the previous day’s game. He
said that these occasions are when Ponko
endears himself to his tearmnates.

“TheyseeMarkoutthereworkinghard,

Ponko is taking this season in stride. He
knows that one mistake could cost him his

 his years north of the border,

Flutie wonltwo  Cups (the CFL’s ver-
sion of the Super Bowl). He was also the
league MVP six times and the leading
passer ﬁve times.

It took eight years of excelling there
to even get another chance at the NFL. I
guess it didn’t matter how many games
Flutie won —— the NFL is blind if you’re
short.

But this summer, the Buffalo Bills
called; they wanted Flutie to come and
back up Rob Johnson, the team’s
unproven, overpaid starting quarterback

Flutie signed on and impressed in
training camp. He accepted his backup
role and watched as Johnson and the Bills
got off to a 1-3 start.

During the Bills ﬁfth game against the
Indianapolis Colts, Johnson left the game
with an injury, and Flutie came in and ral-
lied the team to victory.

Last week, with Flutie at the helm
again, Buffalo shocked the undefeated
Jacksonville Jaguars. The Bills won in the
garne’s ﬁnal play, a dramatic, naked-boot-
leg touchdown rtm by Flutie.

Flutie is slated to start again this
week, while Johnson continues to nurse
his injury. But the saddest thing is that
once Johnson heals, he will once again
step into the starting position, no matter
what Flutie does.

When will the NFL learn?

Teams are blind. Every year teams
pass over countless standout college ath-
letes because they are a few inches too
short or a few pounds too light.

A talented smaller player is better
than a big player who has nothing to offer
but size.

 , Look iati the ‘Steelers’,-e,h.Jamain.

Tirafted in" ﬁrst round three years ago
simply because of his 
 . He has done virtually nothing but take

up a whole lot of space and money on the

Steelers bench. A guy like former Pitt
Panther Tony Orlandini, who is on the
Steelers’ practice squad, has more talent
but wasn’t drafted because he doesn’t ﬁt
that prototypical NFL mold.

No team drafted former Pitt quarter-
back Pete Gonzalez last year, despite the
fact that he threw a Big East record 30
touchdowns in 1997.

The reason was because he was too
small. But I always thought that touch-
downs, not inches, win football games.

The Steelers signed him to be an extra
arm for training camp drills. But in the
preseason he played better than any quar-
terback on the roster, even Kordell
Stewart.

It took all that for Gonzalez to unseat
the unproven Mike Quinn, who played
poorly all preseason.

Who would you rather have on your
team right now, Pete Gonzalez or “can’t
miss” former ﬁrst—rounder Rick Mirer?
How about a choice between Flutie or
Heath Shuler, another quarterback who
hasn’t done a thing in the NFL?

There are those exceptions when late-
rounders make it to the big time, such as
Terrell Davis (seventh round) or Chris
Carter (fourth round), but there are so
many more who never get a fair shot
because they’re too small.

If you don’t believe me_, take a look at

country-season, it is a good measuring

knows its importance.

“How we run that weekend deter-
mines the season. Everything else we
have done means nothing. Our quest is
for the Big East title, and it’s going to
take a supreme effort from the entire
team,” he said.

Women's ‘rugby expects big

win against Fairmount State

Dan Sauder

Staff Wrlter

Rugby can be very confusing at
first, according to members of the
Pittsburgh Angels women’s rugby
team. However, for Lori Altenderfer,
the team’s president and co—captain,
the view of this _week’s upcoming
match couldn’t be any clearer.

“We expect to pretty ‘much kick
their ass,” she said.

The match Altenderfer is referring
to is Saturday’s against Fairmount
State. Her prediction not only had
some wishful thinking behind it, but
also some validity. The team beat
Clarion University, the last collegiate
team it faced, with a final score of .35-
0.

According to Altenderfer, the few
colleges that have women’s rugby
teams do not usually fare too well
against the Angels. This season, the
team’s record is 2-1-1. However, the
Sept. 19 matchup against Indiana
University of Pennsylvania, another
collegiate team, didn’t add to their
win total; they tied with a final score
of 5-5.

The Angel’s next matchup after
Fairmount State is Nov. 7 against
Ohio State University. .4

Their one loss of the season came
in Indianapolis, when the women
played two other city club teams. The
team lost to Columbus 0-8, but
bounced back between matches to
beat host Indianapolis 12-7.
According to freshman team member
Ashley Koonce, there was only five
minutes between matches to recuper-
ate or to think about a way to improve.

As with any sport, in rugby, being
physically fit is of great importance.
According to player and coach Leslie
Bertel, most potential members never
make it to the first game.

“They [people trying out for the
first time] pretty much leave after the

first practice,” said Bertel, 42, who
has played rugby for 16 years.

Bertel is a rarity on the team this
year and, for the most part, in rugby in
general. According to teammate Erica
Love, more than half of the members
of the team never played rugby before
college.

“I never even heard of it before I
got here,” said Love. _

Love is a junior who joined the
team during her freshman year
because she was looking for an athlet-
ic outlet and just happened to see the
rugby table at the activities fair.

“I played my first game after one
hour of practice,” she said.

Bertel and other members of the
team admit this season is considered a
rebuilding year and said interested
players are always welcome. But most
rebuilding teams do not usually have a
winning record or look forward to the
future.

Bertel said any woman who is
interested in playing a sport, likes to
travel and likes to release “aggres-
sion” should call new-player coordi-
nator Hannah Kellener.

Panther volleyball
loses twice in Arizona;

Ashley George

Staff Wrlter

The Panther volleyball team had
a tough weekend, losing two match-
es and dropping to a 10-10 overall
record. The women traveled to
Arizona only to be defeated by both
the University of Arizona and

. Northern Arizona.

The Panthers played the
Arizona Wildcats on Saturday, los-
ing, 9-15, 8-15, 14-16. Despite the

loss, the women played Arizona
closer than many expected. The
powerhouse Arizona squad has
racked up an impressive 16-2
record overall overall record.

Pitt rounded up 36 kills and 27
digs, but was only able to come up

falls to 10-10 record

with five blocks. Tara Haefner gave
the Panthers 29 sets out of a team
total of 33.

On Sunday, the team traveled to
Flagstaff, Ariz., for a match against
Northern Arizona, which beat the
Panthers, 15-10, 15-7, 9-15, 15-8.

Marcia Thiesen contributed 13
kills to the The Panther effort,
while Melissa Alpers, Jenna Birkel,
and Paula Zemrowski had their
share with 10 each. The team had a
total of 11 blocks, giving up only
nine blocks to the Lumberjacks.

The Panthers will play at home
this weekend against the Rutgers
Scarlet Knights and the Seton Hall
Pirates. The team is looking for a
couple of wins to get back to a win-
ning record.

Pitt lacrosse teams. set to
warm up in fall season

Rehan Naslr

Staff Wrlter

Fall is the time for exhibition.

Or Fall Ball, as the lacrosse folk
call it.

With the lacrosse preseason com-
ing to a close, both the men’s and
women’s coaches are optimistic
about the spring season —- the one
that counts. ‘

The men’s team, coached by Rob
Heaps, will finish its season
Halloween weekend in Slippery
Rock. A member of the National
Collegiate Lacrosse League, which
consists of over 100 schools, this
year’s Pitt team is evolving into one
of the best ever.

“This year,” said coach Heaps,
“we have a lot of diversity in the
group and a lot of ability to draw
from. Also, Pitt is very supportive of
us. They’re giving us time and space
to practice.”

The Cost Center and the field
behind it are the current practice and
game fields for the team.

When the spring season starts,
the men will play 15 to 20 games
against powerhouses such as Penn
State, Ohio State, Grove City and
Salisbury State.

But beating hard teams will be

only half the challenge.

“We need to be careful in playing
the local teams such as Carnegie
Mellon, whose programs aren’t as
strong,” Heaps said. “We put them
away easily, which makes the team
more confident than they should be.”

With a_ young squad, the
women’s team is hoping to deal with
its opponents easily. ‘

“Most of the team are freshmen
and sophomores,” said Gary Neft,
the women’s head coach. “We have a
larger group this year than in the
past, and they_ show great promise
and talent.”

The women’s team belongs to the
Women’s Collegiate Lacrosse
League, which is made up of lacrosse
clubs across the country.

There are six divisions of the
league, and Pitt plays in division
two. Pitt shares this league with Ohio
University, Ohio State, University of
Dayton, Kent, State and West
Virginia Wesleyan. '

This weekend will end the exhi-
bition season for the women, when
they travel to the University of
Michigan.

Both the men and the women
hope to improve on last year, when
both teams lost in the first round of
the playoffs.

,5 "At a time when

“ii children suffer from
perhaps the gravest social

problems of any group in

the u.s., how do we ensure

that they grow up in the best

environment possible?
(TIME Magazine, February 3; 1997)

 

YOU can be part of the growing movement to prepare to
meet the needs of tomorrow’s children by enrolling in the
University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work’s Program in
Child Development and Child Care. Through a combination
of hands-on practice in a variety of internship sites, and
classwork, you will learn how to use developmental relation-
ships, counseling skills, activity programming and program
design to promote positive child and youth development.

For further information and application packets for both the
upper division B.S. program and M.S. program, call
624-2909, send e-mail to narr+@pitt.edu, or call in person
at 1717 Cathedral of Learning.
