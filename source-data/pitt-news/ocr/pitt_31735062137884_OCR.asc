negative side of the contest, which
will take place in an Oakland audi-
torium as yet unnamed. Selection of
men for the affair. will be made with-

7:30 o’clock, will likewise include in-
formal entertainment and refresh-
ments_

“We are anxious to see as many
men as possible preparing for the
Oxford affair eliminations,” Goldberg

contest. From a large group, we are
more likely to ﬁnd possible material.”

consist of two prominent members of
the Oxford Union society.

Leroy Will Play
At Grotto Again

“VVe hate to part with a good thing,”
explained Don Campbell, ’35, and
Oscar Schlossberg, ’35, president and
social chairman, respectively, of the
College association, in announcing
that Bill Leroy and his Town Tattler
orchestra have been booked for the
informal dance next Friday night.

Leroy’s band has been engaged for
every ﬁrst semester association in-
formal for the past three years. The
unit is. composed almost entirely of
students and alumni of the University.
the leader being a senior in the
School of Business Administration.
Bob Johnston, E35, Jack Conley,
Med36, and Bob Rial, BA35 are also
student members.

Maintaining a tradition of a few

years’ standing, the association has
contracted for the Grotto ballroom on
the North Side for the affair. The
largest indoor dance ﬂoor in the city
and reputedly one of the most beauti-
ful in this section of the state, the
Grotto each year has been a popular
site for University social events.

Membership tickets, priced at $2,
are now on sale with association cab-
inet appointees. These tickets cover
admission _both to Friday’s informal
dance and to a formal affair sched-
uled for November. All students in
the University are eligible for mem-
bership.

Italian Students
Visit University

 

Chancellor Bowman Welcomes
Visiting Delegation
I

In gay, colorful jackets and uni-'
forms, and in striking hats of green,
blue, and red, almost 350: Italian Uni-
versity students on an exchange tour
throughout the United States, spent
Tuesday morning visiting the Cathe-
dral of Learning.

The party was officially welcomed
by Dr, John G. -Bowman, Chancellor
of the University. ‘As a token of re-
spect, Dr. Poli, Secretary-General of
Italian university alumni, then pre-
sented Dr. Bowman with a large tome
describingltalian universities and a
Latin scroll expressing gratitude for
the reception, which Dr. Poli read be-
fore the assembly. The group then
visited the top- of the Cathedral and
other schools in the city.

From 110011 to 12:30 o’clock, the
Italian students attended a radio pro-
gram broadcast in English and Italian
over KDKA and transmitted to Italy
by WSXK. The program consisted of
musical selections by a group of the
students; an interview in English be-
tween John W. W. I-Iallock, executive
secretary of the General Alumni as-
sociation, and one of the students, in
which the student asked about the
origin and history of the University
and the Cathedral; a short talk by
Dr, Sircana, the Italian consul; a
short talk by Joseph Natali, one of
the leading Italian-American citizens
in Pittsburghh; and ﬁnally, an inter-
view in Italian between M. A, De-
Vitis, associate professor of modern

 

professor of economics in the Univer-
sity of Pisa.

After lunch the Italian group left
for Cleveland, Ohio. The visitors ex-
pressed the hope that American uni-
versity students might be their guests
at the dedication of University city
in Rome next spring.

The committee in charge of the re-
ception included Mr. Hallock, general
chairman, Mrs. Ruth Crawford ,
Mitcliell, and Mr. DeVitis.

Thursday, October 11 «

All freshmen in the Schools of Edu-
cation, Business Administration, and
in the College will be required to take
psychological tests on October 11 in
Memorial hall, according to Dr. Omar,
C. Held, personnel assistant to the
dean of the College. Letters are be-
ing sent out now through the various
schools.

There has been a gradual increase
in the grades on these tests every
year. The improvement has been co-
incidental with the fact that each year 5
the majority of freshmen! have had
higher class standings in high school.

 

No Noticeable Decrease
In Language Department

Although the language requirement
. in the College has been reduced, there
Eliave been no marked drops in the en-
Erollment for modern language courses

iton, professor and head of the depart-
' ment.

Money And

The College Association, which pre-
sents its semi-annual informal dance
a week from tonight, maintains a
function that is not generally known
but perhaps justifies its existence
substantially more than the fact that
it conducts two inexpensive dances
each semester.

The original purpose of the associa-
tion is to sponsor a student loan fund,
which places small sums of money
with needy students in the College
for short time periods. These loans
seldom run over $40, with the aver-
age being between $15 and $25. Loans
are granted for a mzszximum time from

News Appiican ts
Register To day

 

Each year the Pitt News has avail-
able a limited number of positions on
both editorial and business staffs for
students of any classiﬁcation who can
qualify.

This afternoon at 1:30 o’clock in
the News office in Room 801, Cathe-
dral, Jack Tibby, C35, editor-in—chief,
will interview upperclassman editorial
candidates; Ellis H. Tumpson, BA35.
business manager, will meet with all
students applying for positions on
his staff; Marjorie Reich, C35, associ-
ate editor, will conduct a meeting of
upperclass women editorial appli-
cants; and freshman men desiring to
do reporting will meet with -Charles
B. Holstein, C36, associate editor.

The News, now publishing three
times a week, more than ever can use
students with some experience in high
school or metropolitan journalism.

Work on the paper requires a great
deal of time from staff members, but
repays amply in experience. The pro-
cesses involved in publishing a tri-
weekly substantially parallel those
followed on large city dailies.

Incidentally, practically all alumni
who rose to responsible positions on
the News in previous years have since
found highly acceptable jobs in out-
side journalism.

 

Hey Frosh!

No Sophs Will Bother
You As You Relax Or
Play At Sporty Y Hut

How about shooting a game of pool?
Or a round of pingpong? If you are
not so athletically inclined there’s
also chess and checkers. They don’t
even throw kibitzers out of the Y hut,
there. in the shadow of the Stadium.

If you don’t go in for any of the
more strenuous indoor pastimes you
can ﬁnd plenty of recent magazines
and newspapers to p-ass an hour be-
tween classes. Or if that history pro-
fessor has soared you into work,
there are a number of easy chai.rs that
are more conducive to sleep than to
study. Even if you just want to‘ talk,
there are interesting fellows just
waiting to discuss anything from the
Cathedral elevators to our chances
with Southern Cal, Radio and piano
are there if you’re musical. Go up and
look. around and if nothing interests
you, then you'd better step down the
street to the Falk clinic.

Abbreviations Foliowed
By Pitt News Explained

 

 

   

There has been some confusion on
the part of freshman and transfer
students in interpreting the symbols
used by the Pitt News to designate
the names of the various schools of
the University, For their conven-
ience, the following list is published:
College, C; Business Administration,
BA; Education, Ed; Engineering, E;
Mines, M; Medicine, Med; Law, L;
Dentistry, D; Pharmacy, Ph; Gradu-
ate, G; Petroleum reﬁning, P.

Subdivisions in Engineering are
designated thus: Aeronautical, AE;
Industrial, IE; Meclianical, ME;
Chemical, ChE; Civil, CE; Electrical,
EE.

Students’ class standings are indi-
cated by the numbers of the year in
which they graduate, thus: senior in
the College, C35.

Open House Planned By
Downtown Student Group

The Student organization of the
Downtown division will hold open
house every night next week in its

E Pluribus!

They Are All Gentlemen
Says Only Woman In
l Bental School

Bertha Kreimer, a senior in the
School of Dentistry, and incidentally,
the only woman there, is a few years
up on the report recently released by
the Institute of Women’s Professional,
Relations at the University of North
Carolina,

This report reviewed the growing
ﬁeld for women in dentistry, especial-
ly in clinic, children’s and preventive
work. “The evidence from women
dentists shows that they have an
equal opportunity in the School of
Dentistry in spite of their very limit-
ed numbers; that they do not meet
opposition from their male colleagues
and that the general public is now
willing to accept them,” the bulletin
concluded.

Miss Kreimer, when talking about
her work in the School of Dentistry,
said her interest in the work was
centered. about her visits to her
brothc.-.r’s office. W'orking with the
dentistry students, although all are
of the opposite sex, “is a pleasure,”
she stated, “and they all are perfect
gentlemen.” Asked why more women
did not enter dentistry, she admitted
she didn’t know. Miss Kreimer is
not certain what she will do in the
future in her profession.

What will likely be the outstanding
game in the country tomorrow will
get under way at 2 o’clock in the
Stadium when the 1935 edition of
Pitt’s football varsity stacks up
against the Presidents of Washington
a.nd Jefferson college. The VVasl1-
Jeff boys will be out to better last
year’s remarkable exhibition against
the Panthers, that of ..holding Pitt

scoreless for more than three-quarters
of the game. Dr. Sutherland’s men
will be set to take care that no such
thing happens.

Starting lineups for botl1 teams
are now pretty well certain, with the
exception of one position on each
team. For VV. & J.., the problem
lies at the fullback post, where both
Bill King and McBurney are capable
performers, McBurney is perhaps
the fastest fullback the Presidents
have had in years, and the memory
of King cracking the Panther front
line last season is still fresh in the
minds of those who saw that battle.

No Escort Worry
For This Dance

Senior Mentors Will Provide
Co-Ed Prom Partners

Freshman women will soon be busy
making original garden hats from
blue and gold crepe paper for the an-
nual Co-ed Prom to take place in the
Twentieth Century club Wednesday,
at 7:30 o’clock. The blue and gold
paper can be purchased today for ﬁve
cents at either of the VVAA candy
stands, in Alumni hall or on the tenth
floor of the Cathedral.

No freshman woman need worry
about an escort, because escorts will
be p1'ovi<:led by the senior mentors.
The mentors, members of Mortar
Board, and members of the governing
board of VVAA will form the stag line.

Dress for the evening will be infor-
mal, summcr party dresses for the
freshmen, and white ﬂannels and dark
coats for the escorts.

Steve Stoffan’s orchestra has been
scheduled to play for the. prom. A
program has been planned between
dances. Miss Elizabeth Rearick, phy-
sical education instructor, is training
a group of eight girls for the
qu.adrilles. Carolyn Hall, C36, pro-
gram chairman, and not master of
ceremonies, has promised a quartette
and several solo dances by Bernice
Simpson, C37, Mary Jo Kunkle, C37
and Louise Kelly, C36.

Clever favors on which the fresh-
men can mark down their dances will
also be distributed at the dance.

Mary Gertrude Herron, Ed35, is
general chairman of the affair.

Freshman Women Know Their Minds,
Vocational Aspirations, Survey Shows

And what do they want to be, those
200 freshman women with the green
arm bands? Actresses, social serv-
ice workers, scientists, and lawyers,
or so they say on the vocation cards
they filled out at registration.

Call it elementary education, tutor-
ing or secondary instruction, teaching
leads by a wide margin in the survey,
being the ﬁrst choice of over 100
women. Away behind, comes social
service work with 20 votes. The Pitt
News will have plenty of reporters
next year if the 14 women who chose
journalism keep their word. Eleven
Women are physical-educationally in-
clined, and as many have the busi-
ness world as their goal.

Remember the high school days
when every sophomore girl wanted
to be a nurse, a librarian or private
secretary to the president of the Mel-
lon bank-? They probably have
changed to sociologists, dieticians and
chiropodists by now, for only 12 fresh-
men have chosen the old stand-bys.

Technicians, chemists, bacteriolog-
ists, research workers and just plain
scientists get their quota of votes for
vocations along with the ﬁve for mu-
sic, three for writing, two for art and
tour for acting.

If everything goes well, by the
graduation of the present freshman
class there will be one more certiﬁed
public accountant, commercial artist,
publisher, advertising manager and
interpreter. Buyer, government work-
er, costume designer, religious edu-
cator, and administrative officer all
get one vote as a vocation.

The professional school will be rep-
resented by the class of 1938 with
nine doctors, one dentist, one pharm-
acist, and (of all things) one chirop-
odist.

There is the husband with a gun, the
wife with romantic ideas, and the in-
evitable poet, In his quoted verse, the
poet’s heart certainly does throb like
the engine of a Model T. The letters
of the two free lovers do smack of
nights spent reading True Story

sound funny to other people.
But When—

But when the husband has a confer-
ence with the poet, leaving him with

I think the American press would
be doing a great service. to democ-
racy if it at least made an attempt to
raise the social and ethical ideas of
the highly lauded average man a few
degrees above the standards of bar-
barism. That is a time-worn plea, of
course, and one that has grown into
sentimental piping in its "old age.
Yet it is not a serious matter of up-
rooting the divinely-inspired doctrines
of rugged individualism. It will sure-

advertisers to suggest cancelling their

To Sponsor Peace
Poll In Colleges

A “Peace Poll” of the opinions of!
all college undergraduates iii the na-
tion is to be held in January by the
recently-formed Association of College
Editors. The poll will be taken in an
effort to ﬁnd the reactions of Ameri-
can students toward war. The poll
will be taken with the cooperation of
the Literary Digest.

The poll will not be taken immedi-
ately because of a belief that there
IS a lack of sufficient interest among
the college students at present. John
1-Morison, editor of the Harvard ‘Crim-
son, explains: “Of course ACE would
gain a. lot of favorable publicity and
a good send-off, if such a nationwide
‘Peace Poll’ of undergraduates were
conducted immediately.

“But we don’t feel that the under-
graduates in this country are ready
for such a poll. We should launch a
concerted editorial drive to arouse in-
terest in these matters, try to under-
stand them. Then such a poll would
prove something.”

As a result of this idea, college pa-
pers belonging to ACE throughout the
country are planning to publish edi-
torials on the subject of peace and
war prior to the taking of the poll,

 A Week-End Night Club

Keeps Students On
College Campus

One answer to how to keep col-
19'-sians on the campus has been found
by the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, through its night club on
the Memorial Union Terrace, which
is operated during the week.ends_

The Terrace, unique among educa-
tional recreational facilities, is built
on a tree-canop-ied grotto in back of
the Memorial Union club house along
the shores of Lake Mendota. It is
the most popular student meeting
place on the campus. Here beer ﬂows
to order, and meals are served as
well as lighter refreshments; and all
at strikingly low prices.

The board of regents of the Univer-
sity of \Visconsin will not permit the
sale of anything stronger than 3.2 bev-
erages in these days of post-prohibi-
tion. But because of the attractiveness
of the surroundings which the Uni-
versity has provided, no local night
club, tavern, or roadhouse in the vi-
cinity boasts of an equal volume of
sale,

For the fall and Winter evenings
the night club has a ﬂoor show with
a master of ceremonies.

Tennis Tourney
Starts Tuesday

 

All Undergraduate Men May
Compete In Tournament

 

An opportunity long-awaited by
University tennis enthusiasts has
come with the announcement that Dr.
David O’I.-ouglilin, coach of the var-
sity tennis team, will begin a tennis
tourney for men on Tuesday, October
2. The tournament the ﬁrst of its
kind in University history, is 09931 I10
all University undergraduate men, in-
cluding varsity players.

The entry blank below must be de-
posited at the office of Dr. O’Loughlin,
in the Stadium, promp-tly by noon
Monday.

Last year’s varsity tennis team,
with Dr_ O’Loughlin in his ﬁrst year
of collegiate coaching, had an excep-
tionally good season, registering
twelve wins and only one defeat, that
being administered by Navy. Ganger,
captain and ﬁrst ranking player last
season, went through the entire sea-
son without losing an intercollegiate
match. Joe Madden, last year’s num-
ber two man on the squad, did nearly
as well, being defeated only once.
James Slocum, Roy Heckler, James
Thompson, and his brother Lloyd, the
remainder of the ﬁrst six ranking
players, are all back again this year,
which promises another good season.
Ganger was the only team member
to graduate.

Included in the 12 victories in the
last season were double wins over
Carnegie Tech and Duquesne, making
the Panthers the class of the local
collegiate tennis teams.

W-J Tomorrow

(Continued From Page One.)

The Ellwood City boy is recuperat-
ing from a series of injuries but it
is quite likely that he will be at least
able to relieve McBurney at some
time during the game.

Pitt’s question mark also lies in the
backﬁeld. A three-cornered ﬁght,
among Bobby LaRue, Heine Weisen-
baugh, and Leon Shedlosky for the
right halfback position will in all
probability not be settled until game
time. Each of the three combines
plenty of running power with good
interference ability and each sparkles
on defense The case rests.

Wash-Jeff’s outﬁt, although suffer-
ing from the loss of ten varsity men
of last year, will be pepped up for
this game as they will be for no other,
and, consequently will be very tough.
Pitt’s eleven, or it may be termed
“Pitt’s thirteen,” will also be lacking
a good number of the stalwarts of
last year. The new offensive forma-
tion, now being called the “Highland
Fling" is deference to Jock Sutherland,
will get a baptism of ﬁre and upon
its success will rise or fall Pitt’s
chances.

1934 Pitt Football Team
Lighter Than ‘33 Regulars

 

 

 

Two hard weeks of practice at
Camp Hamilton, and another hard
week of practice on the campus right
through some hot afternoons, has
quite a lot to do with the reduced
weight of the Panther football team.

As a result the average weight of
the line and the backﬁeld of the team
this season will be slightly less than
the average weights of the line and
backﬁeld of the 1933 team.

The line this year will average 183
pounds. one pound less than the line
of 1933 averaged. The ﬁgures show
that there is a greater diﬁerence in
the average weight of the two back-
ﬁelds. The average weight of the
four men probably starting in the
backﬁeld in the game with Washing-
ton and Jefferson tomorrow afternoon
is 177 pounds. Last year the Pitt
backﬁeld that started against Wash-
ington averaged 180 pounds.

The starting halfback combination
on last year’s tea , Sebastian and
O’De1l, averaged 1 2 pounds, com-
pared with the 170 pound average of
the probable starting halfback com-
bination on the team this year, La
Rue and Nicksick, the Panthers will
be a shade heavier in the halfbacks
than they were a year ago.

Prospects Bright For Strong
Varsity, Freshman Outﬁts

 

Candidates for the cross-country
team are hard at work in preparation
for the opening meet against VVest-
minster on October 13. Coach Olson
is holding daily workouts at the Sta-
dium, getting his charges into shape
for a strenuous campaign. Starting,
running form, and endurance are the
three points which Olson stresses in
his training workouts.

Hopes for a successful season are
bright, what with ﬁve lettermen being
back for the squad. Wagenhouser,
last season’s Allegheny Mountain As-
sociation champion, will again be
available. as will Albright, Kirkpat-
rick, Connelly,, and Musico. The ad-

dition of several stars from last
year’s freshman team will make the
varsity really strong.

The outlook for a freshman team is
yet very much in doubt. A squad of
more than sixty has been p-racticing
daily, and of that group ‘Coaches Ol-
son and Potts hope to ﬁnd an outﬁt
that can match last season’s team in
going through the season undefeated.

VVhen the sixth annual Middle At-

pionships start next Monday morning
at the Greenbriar Tennis club, White
Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, Pitt
will be represented by Joseph and
Robert Madden, the former being No.

the latter, No. 1 man on the yearling
team. They will enter both singles
and doubles competition.

The brothers will not be lacking in
practice, having played in most of
the local tournaments this p-ast sum-
mer with considerable success. Bob
annexed the West Penn Junior crown
along with the Center Court title. and
was runner up to Frank Broida, form-
er Harvard ace, in the Western Mary-
land championship at Mountain Lake
Park. In the very near future, he
meets Dr. John O’Loughlin in the ﬁnals
of the Beaver Valley tournament. Joe
reached the semi-ﬁnals in the DuBois,

with Broida, won the doubles.

In the National Junior Champion-

The Pitt News

Tomorrow afternoon when the
Panthers line up for the kick-off in
the Pitt-Washington and Jefferson
game, it will mark the eleventh con-
secutive year that Dr. John B. Suther-
land has had the coaching responsibil-
ities of the Panthers.

During the ten past years of coach-
ing at the University, Dr. Sutherland’s ,
teams have met the outstanding foot-
ball teams in the country playing 92
games (excluding post-season games.)
Of the 92 games played in the last
10 years the Panthers have won 72,
lost 12, and tied 8,

Behind that remarkable record of
games won and lost are ﬁgures show-
ing the defensive strength of Dr.
Sutherland’s teams. In the last ten
years the average number of points
scored by opponents has been less
than four per game. On the other
hand, the Pitt teams have scored an
average of better than 21 points per
game.

The 1933 Panther team ﬁnished the
season with the distinction of being
the team to hold opponents to the
lowest scoring level since Dr, Suther-
land started coaching at Pitt.

The 1933 team held nine opponents
to 13 points. Minnesota and Navy
were the only teams able to push one
across on the Panthers. The 1928
outﬁt held nine teams to 15 points,
which was the best defensive mark
made by a Pitt team until last year.

Not one bad year in ten seasons is
Dr. Sutherland’s record, His ﬁrst
year at the University found his team
losing 3 games, the most games he
ever lost in one season since he has
been coaching at Pitt. In 1926, 1928,
and 1930 Pitt teams lost two games a
season. In 1925, 1931, and 1933, Pitt
was defeated but once per season.
In three different years 1927, 1929 aand
1932, the Panthers did not lose one
of their scheduled games. '

High Scholastic
Average Made
By Athletes

Pitt athletes have shown them-
selves capable of a serious regard for
studies, maintaining a ﬁne
scholastic average throughout the
athletic groups.

The quality point average for the
athletic group was 1.3 which compar-
ed favorably with the student body’s
average of 1.1 and the minimum re-
quirement for graduation is .75. In
addition, the past season in athletics
e.t‘Pitt was one of the busiest and
most successful. As has been the
case for several years, the riﬂe squad
has had the highest average. The
sharpshooters’ mark was 1.3, and VVil-
liam Frabotta of that team took high
honors with a 3.0 average, which Is

equivalent to a straight “A” record.

The golfers were next with a 1.52
record, while the tennis players fol-
lowed with 1.44 average. The Pitt
swimmers attained a 1.42 mark,

On the athletic honor roll requiring
$1 2.0 or above average twenty of the
athletics won recognition. Bill Atkin-
son of the track team was second be-
hind Frabotta with a 2.9 mark. High
among the athletes on this honor roll
are Captain Cha.rles Hartwig of the
football team, Captain Regis Wolff of
the golf team, Joe Schmeiler, swim-
miug and Arvel Fleming, track star.

And It’s Not Over

The feline colony which in-
habits the basement and ground
floors of the Cathedral was aug-
mented by four new arrivals early
this week. Mother and kittens
are doing very well, having taken
new quarters near the elevators
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

Popular belief has it that the
cats are located in the vicinity
for the purpose of catching rats,
and that is correct. The original
number of cats is unknown, but
now the population has been in-
creased so that the census can
never be very accurately taken.
