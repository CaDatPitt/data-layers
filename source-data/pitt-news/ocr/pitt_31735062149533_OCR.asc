Mr. Berlin Hears About
Two Sophomore Girls

Mr, Irving Berlin, Esq.,
New York, N. Y.
Dear Irv:

The jig is up.

A couple of sophomore girls here
at the University of Pittsburgh
have gone and written themselves
a song. VVhat’s more, a Washing-
ton publisher has started writing
them letters, and he’s not just writ-
ing for their autographs, either.

It seems that these girls-——Jean
Barnes and Ethel Shrom, both of
them C38, whatever that means—
wrote a little number for a wo-
men's interfraternity sing contest.
They didn’t win the contest, so they
had the song copyrighted and in-
duced a local orchestra to play it

at a couple of dances. It went
great.
Last week-end the orchestra

played the thing at an Allegheny
College dance. lt’s called “It Hap-
pened in Connecticut,” but still it
wowed them in Meadville. At about
the same time this publisher got
interested, and that’s the story.
011, yes, they claim they have about
16 more just as good.

Eerily yours,

Ghost Writer No. 456.

Ball Ban;d’s

Press Notices Come At Last!

 

Chairman Charles Ebert, Jr., C,
breathed a sigh. Business Manager
Ralph Appel, BA, duplicated ‘the ef-
fort. For what dance chairman and
business manager wouldn’t do just
that when N. Robert Seidle, assistant
dean of men and faculty adviser to
all worrying dance chairmen, receiv-
ed a bulging brown folder from the
Music Corporation of America. ‘

Yes. the Senior Ball publicity re-
leases have ﬁnally arrived. Now
Ebert guarantees a wide smile and a
“scotty” dog to every couple that at-
tends the ﬁnal major dance of the
school year.

Frank Dailey’s 14-piece “Meadow-
brook Orchestra,” featured over the
Columbia Broadcasting system on an
average of four times each week, is
by this time moving eastward and ex-
pects to arrive in Pittsburgh early
Friday afternoon.

It was 15 years a.go that the Seton
Hall College senior. together with
four schoolmates. conceived the idea
of organizing a dance band. During
the ﬁrst few years the collegiate ﬁve
advanced rapidly, playing fraternity
and school danccs in the East and
iiiid-West.

Four of the original ﬁve—Frank
Dailey, leader, John Clearey, pianist,
William Burger, troinbonist, and Phil
Biard, trumpet p1ayer——are still mem-
bers of the “Meadowbrook” dance
band, and are partners in the Mead-
owbrook Club at Cedar Grove, New
Jersey.

Dailey’s orchestra played under the
title of “B. A. Rolfe and his Mead-
owbrook Orchestra” for cigarette
commercial broadcasts in 1925. For
the past 14 years the band has played
in some of the ﬁnest “hot spots” in

* — Alpin

lthe Metropolitan district, including a

 

ﬁve months’ engagement at the Hotel
McAlpin in New York.

In the round of theater, hotel and
night club engagements, the band
was featured at the Palais d’Or, the
Twin Oaks, and the Arcadia in New
York and at the Pavilion Royal at
Valley Stream, Long Island. Since
1931, with the exception of the Mc-
engagement in 1935, Dailey’s
outﬁt has been broadcasting regular-
ly from the Meadowbrook.

Decorations for the Senior ﬁnale,
under the supervision of Margaret
Speer, C, will be in the form of black
and gold Mortar Boards. A diploma
will hang from each of the 14 boards
decorating mirrors in the Hotel
Schenley main ball room.

A ﬁve-foot model of the Mortar
Board will be suspended from the
wall over the band stand.

Dress for the affair has been an-
nounced as Summer Formal, tradi-
tional for Senior Balls. This, to the
uninitiated, means just about any-
thing for the men, with the exception
of shorts. swim suits, street suits, or
sweaters.

Me“-. will wear white suits, dark
coat-white trousers, tux, mess jacket,
etc., combinations. For the ladies-
well. “most ladies understand sum-
mer formal and probably know much
more about it,” according to Ebert,
“than the committee.”

Dancing will begin at 10 o’clock,
continuing until 2 .o’clock, with the
Grand March, at which time programs
will be distributed, scheduled for
11:30 o'clock.

Tickets sell for $2.50 a couple, and
may be purchased from any member
of the committee, at the dean of
men's oflice, Room 801, Cathedral, or
from Bill Daufenbach, Alumni Hall.

Panther Stays In Lair
Until Covers Get Here

“They double-crossed me,” be-
wails Panther Editor Russell Con-
nolly. “Here we had the June
Panther all ready to go to press
last week and they didn't ship us
the covers. And we can't bring
out a book without covers, not in
this changeable weather, anyway.
As a result 1,000 eager readers
will have to wait until Friday for
their copies.”

“Make it 2,000,” interrupts Busi-
ness Manager Alfred Dixon, ever
the business manager. “Shucks!
Had I known that, we could have
held the senior announcements
sale open another day or two.”

All this means that the June is-
sue of the Panther will not appear
on campus today as was previous-
ly announced in The News. The
magazine will appear Friday, as
good as ever. “After all,” con-
cludes Connolly, “two days more
won’t make much difference in the
age of the jokes.”

'I.‘he committee for the interfraternity formal at the

Dr. William Few, president of Duke University, says
that the cost of education should be higher, otherwise
we build “a race of half-educated and sometimes half-

Probably Took Gum-pvtion

-One coed at the University of Syracuse won ﬁve sticks
of gum on a bet a short time ago when she demonstrated
the system of the fire escape from the third ﬂoor of a
dorm. The ﬁre escape, called “Daveys,” consists of a
piece of sash cord on a pulley. She had been wondering
how one of the things worked when someone said they
would give a pack of gum to see it work. She climbed
out the window and dropped to the ground.

On Itineraries

‘When Johnnie Parks, Andy Cox,
Jackie Lally and a dozen other Uni-
versity students of today used to
rnope around the house because they
had to take their music lessons when
the other kids were outside socking
home runs into somebody’s. flower
garden, they probably never dreamed
that some day those darned-old les-
sons would get them a mo-nt'h’s free‘
trip to Europe and back.

And if their respective mothers
became respective old meanies by in-
sisting upon a full practice hour on
the brightest of bright days, maybe
the niothers will get a. little retribu-
tion for all that this summer in the
form of some lovely perfume from
Paris or a smart tea set from London-.

All of this may happen because a
trio of dance bands, made up for the
most part of University students, will
supply the music for three European
cruises this summer. Each band will
be called the “University of Pitts‘-

It’s a good thing the Senior Ball

the dance, might go walking out
onto the Nixon stage while Miss
Eva Langbord, who-plays the fem-

swinging down the grand march

The two girls hear something of
a resemblance to each other, a re-
semblance so strong, in fact, that
a ﬁrst edition of one of the local
dailies ran Miss S'epp’s picture
above Miss Laiigbord’s name, no
doubt a. surprise to Miss Langbord
as well as to Miss Sepp.

All this comes just» as The News

recent effect achieved by the same

 Syrian Student Solves
Mosque Script Puzzle

For years University stud‘ent=s=£
have trudged past the Syria

.the‘ ornate scribbling which sur-
frourrds the building and wondered’
, what, if anything, it was all about. .

But: now, defying the Ori‘enta‘l‘i'
architect who concocted the whole
thing, comes Edward Ghorra with
a translation of the mysterious .
iS'C1’€lWI. For it is Arabic, and Ed .
is—i1ot an Arab—-a Syrian. He is: r
 here as a special student this" year"
tand will enter the School of Law,
having graduated from the Ameri-
- can University in Beirut, Syria-

_ The inscription on the Syria
Mosque, he says, means, “There is
"no greater conquerer than G‘od‘.""
It is repeated several times as a
decorative motif around the top: of
the building and appears in differ-
ent places lower on the wall’.

There a.re other words written
in various places, but even Ed is
puzzled by these. “They’re too»
complicated,” he says. “Someday

Panther Golfers
Meet N otre Dame
Squad Tomorrow

Irish Favored To Defeat Snyder
Outﬁt On Alcoma Golf Course;
Souchak Faces Win Day

 

By William K. Trosen

“Last but not least,” an off—quoted
quotation, ﬁts exactly into the picture
tomorrow afternoon when the Pan-
ther golfers close the current golfing
season, taking on the Notre Dame
linksmen on the Alcoma course in
what is easily the feature match of
the year,

Even in the golfing circles the good
old Pitt-Irish athletic rivalry ﬂares up
again. This year we have the Pan-
ther outﬁt attempting to wipe out a
last year whipping by the Notre Dame
boys. Vlfhile on the other hand, there
are the Irish who aren’t easy to erase
at any time, if they have anything to
do or say about it,

According to advance news releases,
the six Notre Damers will have lots to
do and say tomorrow afternoon. They
possess one of the crackiest teams in
the mid-west and seeing that they
have always been of the “XKX’ bot-
tle label variety to the Panthers the
match tomorrow should live up to its
feature expectations.

Irish Are Hot

This season the Irish linksmen have
clicked out seven victories in eight
matches against the besta of the
westa. Only Louisiana State has de-
feated the Irish while Chicago, North-
western. Washington, Illinois, Purdue,
‘Wisconsin, and Ohio State lost to the
South Benders.

As could be expected, the reason for
the Notre Dame record is that the
Irish_ers have almost as many stars
as a Betsy Ross ﬂag. Captain Win
Day, the No. 1 man, lays claim to the
University championship for four
years and to being a quarter-ﬁnalist
in the 1934 National Open.

Bill Taylor, a sophomore star, owns
up to" the fact that he holds the record
over the Notre Dame course with a
three under par," a 69, score. Then
there is Bob VVilke, who like the Pan-
thers’ Souchak, plays on the varsity
football team. On the golf squad he
lines up as the No. 2 man.

Souchak At No. 1

And that-’.s' not all. There is Pa:
Malloy, brother to Princeton’s Jack
Malloy, both"-of whom are crack golf-
ers, Lou Fehlig, brother to last year’s
Irish captain, and Bill Castleman, an-
other sophomore star. In case this
isn’t enough there is Bill Cole, No.’ 4
man of 1935, to step in and take a
whack at the ball.

On the Panther varsity, Frank
Souchak will remain at the No. 1 posi-
tion and attempt to take over Win
Day. If it's “Chow’s" Day, he will
close the season with ten.victo_ries
and nary a defeat. U

The other ﬁve posts on the Panther

team will be ﬁlled by the same quin- .
.tet.that started the esason. .Pat Sy-

monds, Bob Mease, J_ohnny.Wasco,

Sam Musico, and Bob Baughman are

the Panther starters. To date, this

‘season has found the Snyder boys win-

ning six of their 11 matches, with a

‘tie with W & J thrown in. _  ».

Grove City’s golfers just couldn't
putt enough on the ball up at Grove

City Saturday afternoon and the
Panther linksmen trapped them into

their second 9-0 match of the season.

It was Frank Souchak, Panther No.
1_ni:-in. who again led the Snyderites to
victory. Q-ank clicked off his eighth
straight victory of the season, but not
before a tough 2 and 1 match with
Grove City’s - Henderson. Souchak
was medalist of the day with a 74. -

All of the other Panther starters

{had a relatively easy time of it all.

Pitt Track Teams
Top Mountaineers

Varsity Scores Third Successive
Win Over \Vest Virginia, 76-50

“Yes, sir, that West Virginia air is
great stuff,” explained one member
of Coach Olson’s track team in ac-
counting for Pitt’s varsity and fresh
victories at Morgantown over the past
weekend.

Of course, he might have added that
it was the same air_he had breathed
before enrolling at Pitt, and you know
these VVest Virginia “snakes” are very
proud of their air. .

At any rate. the day was ideal for
the record-breaking‘ efforts of the
Panther-Mountaineer cinder path
duels and also for the Oak Hill red
devils and Charleston terriers who
staged a two-way ﬁght for the State
school-boy title. « - -- . ..

At the end of the hot afternoon of
competition on the 1/5 mile Mountain-
eer track, three champions had scored
repeat victories. The Panther var-
sity pounded out its third successive
win, 76-50;_ the Little Panthers virtual-
ly duplicated the efforts of their more
experienced mates, 74-43.

, Tost Breaks Record _

However, Harold Tost was re-
sponsible for the greatest individual
feat of an afternoon packed with rec-
ord-breaking performances. “Red” up-
set West Virginia’s great Barney
Gedwilas in the mile, as he ran a
beautiful race, timing himself perfect-
ly to ﬁnish in the very respectable
time of 4221.8 minutes to crack the
tri-state record for the distance.

Jol1i1ny'Wo0di'uff, lanky freshman
middle distance runner, caused the
timers to blink several times, mur-
mur a couple of “Oh’s” and “Al1’s”,
and then ﬁnally shake their heads be-
fore announcing the Pitt yca.rling’s
time in the half-mile as 1:54.9 min-
utes. ,_ V A

The long-legged Connellsville run-
ner seemed just to breeze through
that half as he walked away from the
field. His mark eclipses any previous
varsity or freshman mark at the dis-
tance in University’ history, ‘and
stamps him as a potential "rival to Ben
Eastman, Chuck Hornbostel, and some

Caught ‘Shorts’
Joe Madden In Shorts

Stopped By Cops;
Gets Ticket

   

Joe Madden was caught “shorts”
on Monday. No, it wasn’t in the
classroom. The G-men on the local
police force added another notch to
their Safety Driving campaign by
catching the prominent University ac-
tivities and tennis man for failing to
stop at 3. “Through Street Stop” sign.

The elder Madden was driving his
younger brother, Bob, to school for
an 8:30, and had the law not stepped
in, would ha.ve made it. Coming down
Bryn Mawr Road, Captain Joe, seeing

that trafﬁc was clear on Center Ave--

nue, shifted into second gear to start
up Center Avenue. ’I“here» a couple of
motorcycle -cops thwarted his prog-
ress.

Noticing’ that Joe was clad in
shorts and ﬁnding that he lacked a.n

.owner’s card and an operatc_>r’s li-

cense, the policemen decided to cart

Madden to the Center ‘Avenue Police

station and lock him up. ' 0
“But I have to get my ‘brother to

.school on time,” said Joe. . -

“Neither one of you boys will. -need
to worry about school where we’re
gonna take you,” answered the Law.
“How do we know this isn’t a stolen
car?”t , f -

“Well, I have my driver's card with
me,” replied ﬁob. “That proves I'm
a Madden.” Then after seai'ching
through the pockets of the car, Bob
found the owner’s license.

This proved a great ﬁnd, for it
helped the cop in making out the
ticket, allowed Bob to hurry off to
school, and gave Joe a chance to air

pear in Tramc Court today.

Final Mushball Oar-nes
Postponed By Feely

Just as the Intramural program was
sailing along under what seemed like
a. clear, blue sky, one black cloud
came along and changed the entire
picture. That one black cloud brought
one and a half hours of rain, enough
to inter'l"ere with the mushball
league’s ﬁnale and the tennis tourney
premiere. .

lVIushba.ll, all set to go into" the
championship play-offs, was set back
one day. The rain started at 4
o’clock, which was exactly the time
the Kappa Sigma-Phi Kappa and Phi
Delta Theta-Pi Kappa Alpha games
were scheduled to begin. Wiperl out
on Monday, these contests were post-
poned to yesterday.

Two other play-off entries are Pi
Lambda Phi and Lambda Chi Alpha.
Although beaten Friday, 12-2, by the
Sammies the Pi Lams are still there.

Another Steak
Story, Fellows

Say, fellows, these University
trips are getting us down.

Remember a few weeks ago there
was a News story on a newspaper
trip down to Newark, Delaware?
In it there were a couple of steak
stories-—remember ?

‘Nell, this last trip to the VVest
Virginia foothills where the freshie
and varsity track teams tangled
with the Mountaineers brought
forth a few more gems on the steak
story topic. Here’s a couple.

Lunch on the way down was
‘served at the Hotel Jackson in
Waynesburg. Since the gang was
all trackmen the waitress ups and
serves us with very rare steak, so
rare it bled. One of them Pitt
runners takes a gander at his ﬁery
looking piece and cracked, “They
might have killed this cow but
that's all they did to it!”

V Isn’t that lousy? Well, the for-
mer editor wasn’t looking.

Unbeen Netters
Meet W&J Outﬁt

Seek 15th Straight In TomorroW’s
Match At Little Washington

Pitt’s undefeated tennis team moves
into Vlfashington, Pennsylvania, tomor-
row afternoon to trade volleys with
W & J’s net outﬁt in the second meet-
ing of the season between the two
teams. _

A victory for the Panthers will give
them their 15th straight match tri-
umph, just two away from the all-time
University record of 17.

Chances for No. 15 appear very
bright inasmuch as the shorts-clads
swamped the Presidents, 7-2, in the
ﬁrst engagement a few weeks ago at
the Stadium.

Coach O’Lough1in will probably
start the same sextet that faced Grove
Citylast Saturday, with Bob Madden,

Ralph Bald, Captain Joe Madden, Irv

Solow, John Mogan, and Roy Heckler
being used in that order. Mogan mov-
ed up from No. 6 position to No. 5, and
Heckler, veteran for the past two
seasons, dropped a notch.

After tomorrow’s encounter, the
varsity will get set for the home
ﬁnale against Penn State next Satur-
day. Last year the Pitt boys were
jolted to the tune of 6-3 at State" Col-
lege and willbe seeking revenge In
the coming contest.

Swamp Grove City, 9-0

Sweeping all nine matches, the net-
ters registered their 14th consecutive
victory by taking Grove City’s outfit,
9-0, at the latter’s stamping grounds
last Saturday. » 1

Every singles’ match was taken in
straight sets by the invading Pan-
thers.
6-3, and Ralph "Bald experienced little
diﬁficiilty in trouncing Peterson, 6-3,
6-4.

Captain Joe Madden kept things

moving with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over ‘

Morehead, andpsolow defeated Bing-
ham, 6-4, 6-1. Mogan and Heckler add-
ed the two remaining singles’ points,
Mogan beating Cliatham, 6-4, 6-2, and
Heckler taking Diehl, 6-1, 6-2.

In the tandem contests, the Mad- _

den-Bald duo scored a 6-2, 6-4 triumph
over Faivre and Peterson; J. Madden
and Mogan defeated Morehead and
Bingham, 6-4, 6-4; and Solow and Mc-
Kenna won a three-set affair from
Chatham and Diehl, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.

entirely made up of demonstrations of
play in the various positions, both of-
fensively and defensively. Most of
the demonstrations will deal with the
fundamentals of football.

The lunch sessions will be taken
over by H. 0. “Fritz” Crisler, Prince-
ton coach, and Wallace Wade, coach
at Duke University. Crisler will speak
on “End Play and General Defensive
Tactics,” while Wade takes the other
side of the question with “Offensive
Line Play.” They will speak "in the

ActingU nit Gives,
Group Of Three
Modern Dramas

Three light comedies in a. modern
setting formed the program presented
by Lambda Delta, freshman acting
unit, at the Falk Elementary School

last week.

Geraldine Marcus, as an eccentric
midle-aged woman whose secret ambi-
tion was to endow a fashionable girls’
school, accidentally became an unwill-
ing‘ participant in a sorority initiation
in “Cold Water and Cash.” Florence
Miller, Dorothy Dering, Juliette Deu-
telbaum, Mary Lou McLain, and Betty
Garrett took care of the other roles in

play.

As a playwright, actress, and sten-
ographer, Rita Blasik, Silvia. Briggs,
and Ella Goldblum were involved in
“Mothballs.”

In the cast of “Ghost of a Chance,"
were Ann Helfgott, Alice Hirsh, Elsie
Eckstrom, Mary Campbell, Betty
Adams, and Beatrice Rice.

All three plays were under the di-
rection of Frances Goodwin, C36, sen-
ior adviser to the unit, and Ione Wil-
liams, Ed38, sophomore apprentice ad-
viser. Miss Adams is chairman of the
unit.

Flowers For

Madam Senior

That contraption at the foot of
Heinz House steps today is there
because the sophomore women are
honoring the senior women by pre-
senting each one with a corsage
for the day.

It appears that the class of 1937
started a custom last year when
they honored the seniors on May
Day with a corsage. Janet Hallock,
president of the sophomore class,
says the seniors last year liked it
and the class of 1938 thought it
would be a nice idea to give the se-
niors of 1936 a thrill again this
year.

Lucy Conn, vice president of the
class, with the assistance of the
cabinet, will present the ﬂowers.

Fine Arts Class

an opportunity to watch him at work.
The fresco in the fine arts studio is
in strong white perpendiculars against
a‘ blue background and took Maurer
about two weeks to complete,

Another large fresco in the studio
is a copy of Piero de Franceschi’s
“Legend of the Holy Cross” (1492),
which four student. assistants are
completing under Mr. Elliott’s guid-
ance. Students working on the fresco
are: James Cowan, C38; Ruth Rich-
ards, C36; Mary Snyder, C37; and
Ruth Donley, C38.

The other students are working in
fresco at present on the two pillars
in the studio on which the four races‘
of mankind will be represented by
eight ﬁgures.

The exhibit, which began Monday,
will continue-- in the afternoons
through Saturday of this week. Among
the students exhibiting work are:
James Sandor, C38; Sarah Harris,
C36; Mary Watts, C37; Miss Snyder;
Miss Donley, May Labarthe, special;

Freshman Women
Entertain Senior
Mentors At Tea

Although mentor training was over
last semester, freshman women have
not forgotten the seniors who init-
iated them into their University life.
In appreciation, the Freshman Coun-
cil is sponsoring a tea in honor of the
mentors at Heinz House this after-
noon from 3:30 to 4:45 o’clock.

Forty-two corsage adorned seniors
will be entertained by members of
the ﬁrst’-year class, each freshman be-
ing designated as official hostess, and
four units preparing a program for
the afternoon. Songs by the glee
club unit, a play by the acting unit,
a dance by the sports unit, and a pup-
pet show by the stagecraft unit, will
demonstrate to the seniors the prog-
ress made by their protegees since
last fall.

Miss Thyrsa W. Amosgdean of wo-

men, Misses Isabelle Anderson and
Helen P. Rush, assistant deans of
women, and Miss Mary Garber, sec-
retary in the office of the dean of
women, have been invited to attend
the tea.

The affair has been arranged by a
committee composed of Virginia
Wray, Mary Annette Campbell, Hilda
Beck, Betty Adams, Lea Goldstein,
Grace Augenstene, Ruth Hilsenrath,
and Ann Whippo. '

 

Leaders in the ﬁeld of commercial
education in the Pittsburgh area pa.r-
ticipated in a panel discussion under
the chairmanship of D. D. Lessen-
berry, director of commercial educa-
tion, Saturday morning. Graduate and
undergraduate students interested in
commercial work were guests at the
conference_ which was held in Room
828, Cathedral.

Members on the panel for the dis-
cussion of comiiiercial training were:
Edward Gallup of Ginn and Company,
Mr. Roberts, principal of Prospect Ju-
nior High School, Miss Edith ‘Win-
chester and Mrs. Margaret Ely of
Margaret hlorrison College of Car-
negie Tech, and G. G. Hill of Indiana
State Normal School.

Chairman Lessenberry started the
discussion with a general question on
consumer education. Mr. Hill replied
that commercial training has a broad-
er purpose and wider range of mate-
rial to cover than many other ﬁelds.
Consumer education, he said, must
necessarily be a part of that training.

The trend of the discussion soon
led to the subject of the possibilities
of high school graduates receiving
jobs upon graduation. According to

o'clock in Room 801, Cathedral.

Dixon Injured

Russell A. Dixon, instructor in eco-
nomics, narrowly escaped a serious
i_njur_v to his eyes over the week-end

was greasing his car struck the upper
bridge of his nose. Reports from his
hoineindicate that the injury will not
impair his eyesight and that he will
probably return to school late this
week.

that the average age of women enter-
ing the business world is nearing 20
years of age. Following up the job
angle, Mr. Hill declared that a course
to teach young people to sell them-
selves would be of the greatest value
in the curriculum as a part of sales-
manship.

Another member of the discussion
group added that salesmen are not
born but may be trained by special
courses. People oozing with person-
ality may be failures in salesman-
ship because they do not work, do
not understand their material, and
will not put themselves out to ana-
lyze the needs of the buyer. But it
has been shown that many who have
numerous handicaps may overcome
these by mastering the aforemen-
tioned things.

Further points on the social studies
were brought to the attention of the
listeners, Emphasis should be placed
on developing individuals as social
beings rather than purely technically
trained men and women, agreed the
panel members.

The panel closed with an open
forum in which leaders of the discus-
sion as well as students contributed
