WASHINGTON _‘ Congressional
leaders are negotiating an end-
game for the “super committee”
that could come as soon as Mon-
day as Democrats‘ and Republi-
cans blame .each other for what
appears to be the- panel’s failure
to come up with a $1.5 trillion
deﬁcit—reduction plan.

Despite a ﬂurry of last—minute
proposals and closed meetings, it
appeared increasingly unlikely
that members of the bipartisan
committee could compromise on
the contentious issues of taxes
and entitlement spending that
have deadlocked the talks.

As President Barack Obama
returned from a weeklong trip to
Asia, the White House urged the
committee to accomplish what it
set out to do.

“Avoiding accountability and
kicking the can down the road
is how Washington got into this
deﬁcit problem in the ﬁrst place,”
White House spokeswoman Amy
Brundage said. “So Congress
needs to do its job here and make
the kind of tough choices to live
within its means that American

, A Pitt graduate spending the year

in Tanzania working to help peo-
ple infected with HIV and AIDS
has been named a 2012 Rhodes
Scholar. A '
Cory Rodgers, who graduated
‘from Pitt in August 2011 with a

Bachelor of Philosophy degree

in Africana studies and history
and philosophy of science and
a Bachelor of Science degree in

biological sciences-, is the sev-
enth Pitt undergraduate-degree
recipient to win a Rhodes schol-
arship, according to a statement
from Pitt released Sunday. '
The scholarship, which is one
of the oldest and most prestigious
international study awards avail-
able to U.S.i students, provides
the 32 winners with two to three
years of study at the University
of Oxford in England, according
to the statement from Pitt. The

Rhodes Trust pays for all univer-

sity fees and provides a stipend
to cover necessary expenses,
including transportation to and
from England.

“The coveted Rhodes Scholar-
ship is one of the highest honors
available to young adults who
successfully combine intellectual
excellence, positive character, ef-
fective leadership and a genuine
concern for others,” Pitt Chancel-
lor Mark Nordenberg said in the
statement.

“This prestigious award pub-

licly recognizes individuals who
have built an existing record of
high achievement and impact and
who are judged to have excep-
tional potential for future service
to humankind,” he said.
Rodgers was not immediately
available for comment.
Rodgers, from Somerset,
Pa., is 'a first-generation college
student coming from a family of
bricklayers. He is spending the
year in Tanzania working on a

and Aids in Rwambaizi.”

The press release states that
Rodgers’ program is working to-
ward developing an HIV-positive
person’s capacity to raise free-
range chickens as a sustainable

‘and growing source of food and

income. He is also trying to ex-
pand existing social structures
within the Rwambaizi AIDS
support group that is already in
place.

In his time at Pitt, Rodgers
worked as an undergraduate
laboratory researcher in chem-
istry, was a member of “Keep It
Real” and Phi Beta Kappa and
worked with Habitat for Hu-
manity through Pitt’s Alternative
Spring Break.

While at Oxford, Rodgers will
study medical anthropology and
migration studies, with the goal
of becoming a medical practitio-
ner. He wants to work “among
people affected by displacement,
urbanization and cultural plu-
ralism,” according to the state-
ment.

He is one of32 students from
18 U.S. colleges and universities

to win the award this year. The ,

winners, who were announced
on Saturday, are chosen based on
academic achievement, personal
integrity, leadership potential
and physical vigor, all of which
offer the promise of effective
service to the world in future
decades.

Recipients begin their studies
at Oxford in October 2012. .

families make every day.”

The co-leaders of the panel,
Rep.Jeb Hensarling, R—Texas, and
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., in
separate appearances on Sunday
talk shows, said they held out
hope for last-minute progress
but saw little chance of breaking
the impasse.

“Reality is to some extent start-
ing to overtake hope,” Hensarling
said on “Fox News Sunday.” “It is a
huge missed opportunity.”

The deadlock focuses on fa-
miliar economic themes that have
divided Congress all year and will
underscore the choice before vot-
ers in the 2012 elections.

Republicans blamed Demo-
crats for being unwilling to seri-
ously revamp Medicare and the

‘other health programs to reduce

government spending.
Democrats say Republicans re-

- fused to substantially break their _
anti-tax pledge, insisting on a deal.

that would preserve the George
W. Bush-era tax breaks for the
wealthy.

“There is one sticking divide,
and that is the issue of whatI call
shared sacriﬁce, where everybody
contributesin a very challenging
time for our country,” Murray said
on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“That line in the sand, we haven’t
seen any Republicans willing to
cross yet.”

The committee has until
Wednesday to vote on a proposal
that would reduce the nation’s def-
icits by $1.5 trillion over a decade.
Talks continue behind closed
doors, but with the requirement
that any deal be posted by Monday
evening, prospects for a compro-
mise havedimmed. 3: 

In bringing negotiations to a
close, leaders are seeking to sal-
vage what remains of Congress’
already dismal approval ratings,
according to those familiar with
the private talks but who were not
authorized to speak publicly. _

some had discussed "°‘°°"“°‘”"



proposals for a vote
only to see them fail along party
lines. —

“There’s no reason to burn the
house down as you leave,” said one
aide familiar with -the talks.

Publicly, at least, there has
been little progress since both
sides balked at each other’smost
recent proposals as House Speak-
er John A. Boehner, R—Ohio, and

. Senate Majority Leader Harry

Reid, D-Nev., stepped in to swap

_ offers late last week.

Obama has largely stayed away
from publicly intervening in the
committee’s work. That has drawn
criticism from Republicans, even
though Democrats say they keep
in constant contact with the White
House. '

If no deal is reached, domestic
and Defense Department accounts
will face automatic spending cuts
that would be triggered in 2013.

 

 

l Defense hawks are angling to pro‘-

tect the Pentagon, however.

Sen.lPatrickJ. Toomey, R-Pa.,
said on CBS’ “Face the Nation”
that it was important to “change
the conﬁguration” of the manda-
tory cuts to soften the blow on the
Pentagon in particular.

But Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-

Ca1if., said. on Fox that it would-

be “wimpy” to_undo the so-called
triggers. ‘ * ’ A
In the committee’s ﬁnal days,

. the Republicans’ latestoffer was a

package that would cut $640 bil-

lion off deﬁcits over a decade _ far -

below the committee’s goal, but a
fallback proposal that could make
a down payment on reining in fed-

eral deﬁcits and limit mandatory -

reductions. It included $3 billion
in new tax revenue that would
come from closing the loophole

MCT Campus

that allows a tax deduction for
corporate jets. ~
“Our Democratic friends said

, no to that offer because it didn’t

raise taxes,” Sen. Jon Kyl, R—Ariz.,
said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Democrats initially sought
more than $1 trillion in new taxes
as well as more than $1 trillion in
spending cuts as part of a broader
package, a level of revenue Repub-
licans called a nonstarter. Their
more recent offers sought less tax
revenue.

 ,“We didn’t come here to do

another tax cut to the wealthiest
people,” Sen. John F. Kerry, ‘D-
Mass., said on “Meet the Press.”
Even if the super, committee
fails this week, members say their
work will continue. Already, some
lawmakers are discussing where to

pick up from the panel’s work.

Piracy bills
counterproductive

College students, who often frequent
illegal ﬁle—sharing websites, are un-
likely to support any legislation that
forces them to pay for music or mov-
ies. But every citizen, college-aged
or not, should rally against two bills
making their way through the House
and the Senate — the Stop Online
Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act,
respectively. ..  ; 2 . I  . 

* The bills, like 200_ ’S PRO-IP Act
and 1998’s Digital Millennium Copy-
right Act, target copyright infringe-'
ment. Unlike those laws, however, they
allow the attorney general to designate
websites thatlnternet service provid-
ers, payment providers, search en-
gines and advertising networks must
block. In theory, only sites devoted
to sharing pirated content would be
affected. In reality, many of the acts’
provisions would encourage over-
censoring and stiﬂe new, innovative
companies. - ‘

First and foremost, the Stop Online
Piracy Act would hold websites ac-
countable for any infringing content
theirusers post, regardless ofwhether
they remove said content once they’ve
been notiﬁed of its existence. In other
words, if someone uploaded a music
video to YouTube without the record
labels consent, the website itselfwould
be held liable.

Inevitably, this law_would impede
small startup companies that don’t
have the resources to police their
content. According to The New York

Times op-ed contributor Rebecca
MacKinnon, Weibo, China’s version
of Twitter, employs roughly 1,000
people to ensure users don’t post
anything critical of the government.
AlthoughtheAmericanbills don’ttar-
getfree speech, theyrnight necessitate
similarly rigorous enforcement.
Online service providers would

- V— also bear gregiter responsiliﬂityfgrpi-

rated material Underthe Stop 
Piracy Act, private companies could
sue providers for even unknowingly
hosting  content — a pros-
pect that might encourage them to err
on the safe side and block anything
remotely suspicious._

For the above reasons, many on-
line entrepreneurs, including Google
executive chairman Eric Schmidt,
have decried the bills as inane and
misguided. But their disapproval is
counterbalancedbywidespread sup-
port from reputable entertainment
organizations, includingthe American

Federation ofMusicians,theDirectors 1
Guild of America, the MotionPicture
Association ofAmericaandthe Screen .

Actors Guild.

Copyright infringement is a seri- V

ous problem; according to a recent
MarkMonitor study, websites offering
pirated‘ content attract 53 billion hits
each year. But anti—piracy legislation

' all too often neglects nuance in favor

of all-encompassing stringency. The
online community deserves a better
solution.  ‘

GOING MENTAL

Coping with eating anxiety

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

  

Thanksgiving is a harvest holiday,
a celebration that very literally re-
volves around dinner. Many-people
— myself included — cite “real
food” as one of the most antici-
pated perks of going home for the
holidays.

At a time when one in six Ameri-
cans struggle with hunger, accord-
ing to FeedingAmerica.org, hav-
ing plenty to eat is still cause for
celebration. But for some people
who do have enough to eat, worry-
ing about food during the holidays-

— doesn’t endfwith--putting in a few
V hours at the local soup kitchen.

Even for many‘ of the fortunate,
this food-centric celebration is a

[source of mixed feelings + or even

unmixed dread.
According to most clinics,

._»roughly 10 percent of Americans
"suffer from some type of eating

disorder. On college campuses, es-
timates are even higher. Consider,
in addition to these grim statistics,
the number of Americans — many

uring Thanksgvin

of whom are healthy and meet none
of the criteria for obesity — who
are trying to lose weight, and the
number of people whose families
are critical of their bodies. It isn’t
surprising that chow-down holi-
days can be anything- but relax-
ing. '

A Google search of “holidays
with eating disorders” turns up
3,640,000 results. Most empha-
size the same piece of advice: Plan
ahead. If you’re in recovery and
have a nutritional plan, stick to it
as well as you can. If you don’t think
there will be any “safe foods” ——

foods you feel comfortable eating

even when you’re not feeling your
strongest —- at your family’s big
holiday meal, make or buy some-
thing and bring it along.
Haveiisomeone you can call for
support if you’re in a crisis during
the holidays. Discuss your respec-
tive schedules before you go home,
and alert him or her to the possibil-
ity of an S.O.S. call. If someone you
trust will be at dinner with you,
develop a‘ signal you can give if you
need him or her to invent an excuse
for you to leave the room and col-

  

MCT Campus

lect yourself.

If you have a loved one who suf-
fers from an eating disorder —~ or
who you suspect does — do not try
to force him or her to eat. Do not
draw attention to his weight, even
to fuss about how thin he is getting.
Do not harp on what she eats or
doesn’t eat. Don’t be offended if
that person passes on your famous
apple pie.

In short, don’t badger — feeling
scrutinized can trigger eating-dis-
ordered behaviors even in people
who are in recovery. Attempting to
practice tough love is guaranteed
to do more harm than good. The
best thing you can do for a fam-
ily member affected by an eating
disorder is to ﬁnd out what his or
her safe foods are, make sure those

"foods are available and then steer

the dinner—table conversation to-
ward anything and everything that
isn’t body size or food.

Even for those who don’t suffer
from eating disorders, Thanksgiv-
ing dinner isn’t always a relaxing
prospect.

That’s because most people

have families. For some people,
going home means enduring your
less-than—under’standing relatives’
ignorant comments about your
choice to be vegetarian or vegan, or
it means trying to maintain healthy
portion sizes while supervised by
an Italian grandmother who will
cry if you don’t take seconds. And
for some people, going home to
the family means going home to
a never-ending storm of criticism
about weight and body’size.

I’m consistently shocked at how
many of my perfectly healthy and
beautiful friends have been called
fat, have been raked over the coals
for negligible or imaginary weight
gain or who simply have been skew-
ered with disappointed looks and
declarations of “You haven’t lost
any weight” when they went home
to visit their families. Mothers seem
to be the most common culprits,
but fathers, grandparents, aunts

If this is the type of situation
that awaits you at home, go in pre-
pared with a list of aﬂirmations you
can use to brush off hurtful com-
ments. If you can tell yourself, “My
doctor says I’m healthy” or “I’Ve
gained muscle this semester,” you
can keep rude remarks in perspec-
tive.

Remember that critics almost
always have their own reasons for
tearingyou down. Maybe your mom

 

and uncles can also be guilty.

Panthers win two games over weekend
Kiesel, Davis shine as Pitt defeats

Jasper Wilson '

Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team rode ca-
reer days from Brianna Kiesel and Marquel
Davis to a win over Central Michigan on
Sunday afternoon.

Withthe 77-70 victory, the Panthers
(3-1) have now won three consecutive
games.

Sophomore guard Davis, who ﬁnished’

with a then career—high 17.points in Fri-
day’s game against Loyola, scored 26
against Central Michigan. Kiesel, a fresh-
man guard, bested her previous career-
high of 17 points from two games ago by

putting up 24. A

Both players said they didn’t notice that
they were working on career-highs during
the game because they were focused on
the task at hand. I

Kiesel said that for her, staying focused
meant continuously being aggressive and
driving to the basket. The drives helped
her set a Petersen Events Center record
for freethrows attempted with 17 and free
throws made with 15.

Despite her recent strong performances,
Kiesel said she still hasn’t quite gotten used
to the fact that she’s a college player.

“Every game Fm still nervous,” she said.
“I still have those jitters.”

Tlie Pitt women’s basl<etl3all team defeated the Loyola Greyhounds 65-59 on Friday
afternoon in front of5,000 local children in attendance for the Scliool Day event.

Chris Fanelli
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team overcame
two scoring runs by the Loyola Greyhounds
to pick up its second win of the season on
Friday afternoon.

Loyola started the game on a 7-0 run and
then put together an 8-0 run to start the sec—
ond half, but the Panthers — the youngest
team in Division I — came away with a 65-59
victory.

“I think it’s tremendous,” head coach
Agnus Berenato said of her team overcom-
ing adversity. “It should show them a lot.
I’m proud of this team because they stayed
together, and I think this will be great learn-
ing experience.”

Over 5,000 local children made the trip to
the Petersen Events Center for Pitt’s School
Day event. Pitt’s Marquel Davis and Kyra
Dunn treated the students to stand—out per-
formances.

Davis led the Panthers with a career—high
17 points to go along with a career—high ﬁve
rebounds. She was aforce in the second half,
scoring all but two of her points after half-
time. I

Sophomore forward Dunn put up her first

career double-double with a career—high
10 points and a career—high 13 rebounds.
She added six blocks, and the Greyhounds
couldn’t ﬁgure out how to avoid Dunn in the
paint. A

“I take pride in my defense, especially
knowing that once I get a rebound or a
blocked shot, that’s what gets my game go-
ing,” Dunn said. “I don’t need to score in order
to get going.”

Berenato called a timeout only 2:09 into
the game in order to stop Loyola’s run and
calm her inexperienced team. The players
responded. 

The Panthers took an 18-16 lead whe
co-captain Abby Dowd secured an offensive
rebound and knocked down a three from the
right baseline.

Fellow co-captain Ashlee Anderson helped
extend the lead when she saved the ball un-
derneath and fed Leeza Burdgess for an easy
lay-up.

Dowd scored 11 points, but the co-cap-
tain’s greatest contributions won’t show up
on the stat sheet. In the midst of both runs
by the Greyhounds, she hit shots that kille
their momentum. ~ '

Pitt women’s rugby qualiﬁes for nationals  

Jasper Wilson
Staff Writer

After completing the season undefeated
in the Allegheny Rugby Union for the sec-
ond consecutive year, the Pitt women’s
rugby club team has continued its win-
ning streak into the postseason.

Club sports teams compete with
teams from other universities, but their
athletes aren’t on athletic scholarships
and the teams aren’t governed by the
NCAA. Pitt women’s rugby reached the
championship game of the Midwest
Sweet Sixteen — the playoffs for the
Midwest Rugby Football Union — and
qualiﬁed for nationals in April. The Mid-
west Rugby Football Union is one of four
territorial unions that govern regions
of collegiate and amateur rugby in the
United States.

Pitt didn’t allow any of its four oppo-
nents in the ARU to score more than five
points in a single game, but the team still
had to win conference playoffs to qualify
for the Midwest Sweet Sixteen.

It accomplished its goal. While senior
captain Chelsey Mitchell said that any

the Midwest Sweet Sixteen proved that
the team can compete with the best in
the country.

“A trip tothe national Final Four is a
very realistic goal,” Simasek said.

In the ARU playoffs, Pitt easily dis-
patched Clarion 48-5, setting up a meet-
ing with rival Slippery Rock.

Andrews said Slippery Rock gave Pitt
its toughest game yet, saying “it was the
first game where [the team members]
were really challenged.” In the end, Pitt
prevailed by the close score of 19-12 and
advanced to the Midwest playoffs.

There, Pitt defeated No. 8 ranked

While both Pitt and Winona qualiﬁed
for nationals by winning in the semiﬁ-
nals, their matchup still had signiﬁcance
as it helped to determine seeding at na-
tionals in the spring. , -

Pitt lost to Winona 31-10, which gives
Pitt the second seed in Midwest region.

Simasek attributed the loss to the all

In preparation for nationals, the team
will take December off and begin a winter
workout program once classes resume
in January. -

The workout program is crucial, Si-
maseksaid. After seeing his team com-
pete against higher—level opponents, he
said it’s clear that the players need to get
stronger and faster before nationals.

In addition to the workouts, the team
will practice two to three times a week at
the-Cost Center until the end of February
when the practices can move outside.

Pitt will play in three tournaments to
help prepare fornationals.

Panthers never trail in close win over Chippewas

‘ Central Michigan 4 7'

Michigan went on a run.

“I was really focused on  how we were
going to ﬁght back on whatever they did,”
Davis said.

Head coach Agnus Berenato said both
players got it done when it mattered.

“Whenever we needed something
clutch, these two ladies came through,”
she said. V _ .

After getting out to an early 10-2 lea
against the Chippewas (0—3), Pitt allowed
Central Michigan to ﬁght its way back into
the game with an 8-_0 run to make the score
14-12. '

V The Panthers led 32-28 at the half. ,

Pitt began the second half by scoring
eight" unanswered points for its largest
lead of the game, 4o—28.

  Each team was

 

playing each
possession like we
were fighting for
our ‘lives’.

—Agnns Berenato



\

"When Central Michigan reduced the Pitt
lead to 64-60‘ with less than ﬁve minutes
remaining, Davis responded. She drove
the\length of the floor to convert a layup
and hit a free throw after getting fouled
on the play. ‘

Sophomore center Leeza Burdgess had
her way inside with the much smaller Cen-
tral Michigan frontcourt, compiling 13
points and eight rebounds.

Berenato said Burdgess played a key
role in the victory.

“[She] camein and really gave us a spark
that was amazing,” Berenato said. “She’s
becoming a powerhouse and a strength
off the bench.”

Burdgess’s back-to-back layups with
three minutes left made the score 72-63
and put the game out of reach for the Chip-

i

pewas with 2:30 remaining.
“Each team was playing each posses-

' sion like we were ﬁghting for our lives,’’

\ '

Berenato said.

Berenato said she thought the Panthers
won the game at the free throw line. The
team’s goal was to shoot 80 percent from

the line, she. said, and Pitt achieved that‘

goal. The Panthers hit 20 of 24, foul shots
(83.3 percent).

Pitt never trailed in the game, but the
Chippewas kept it close. Central Michigan
went on a 15-8 run in the last nine minutes
to make the score 68-63 before Pitt pulled
away. . . V

“Whatever they did, we came back 10
times harder,” Kiesel said.

Central Michigan was led by Crystal
Bradford’s double—double of 18 points
and 12 rebounds and]as’Mine Bracey’s 18

- points and eight rebounds.

The Chippewas ﬁnished with 26 turn-
overs, whereas Pitt turned the ball over
25 ‘times.

Davis said the key to withstanding Cenﬁ‘

tral Michigan’s various runs was Pitt keep-
ing its composure.

“I think that’s what we did best,” Davis
said. “The main thing was to not panic and
just stay focused.” I

Davis leads
crucial run
for Pitt  

Loyola 4 7D

The clutch plays by the co-captains were
just the beginning of a 19-4 run over the last
12:45 of the ﬁrst half. ‘

The Greyhounds managed to make just
ﬁve of 23 shots in thé ﬁrst half, after hitting
their ﬁrst three attempts. '

Loyola started the second half on an 8-0
run that lasted 3:38. Anderson stopped the
run by making a lay-up while absorbing a
foul. She. hit the free throw to put the Panthers
Loyola wouldn’t get closer than three
points the rest of the game. ' 3

The Greyhounds cut the lead to 38-34 with
9:54 left, but then Pitt sophomore guard Davis
took over.

She went on a personal 9-1 run to put Pitt
up 47-35 and was able to repeatedly drive the

—MarqueI Davis

lane in the second half.

She also thwarted the Loyola press, which
was, giving freshman guard Brianna Kiesel
trouble after the break. She turned the ball
over seven times in the second half.

Davis’ personal run began Pitt’s 15-1 run
that put the game out of reach for good. The
Panthers extended their lead to 18 with 6:17
remaining. .

“Going into the second half, my teammates
just said calming things to me,” Davis said. “I
just had to calm down. And when you calm
down, the game just kind of comes to you.”

The Greyhounds cut the lead to three with
29 seconds left, but the Panthers prevailed.

The Panthers forced 24 turnovers and
scored 31 points off turnovers — the most
points off turnovers for Pitt since Dec. 16,
2008, against Wagner when the Panthers
scored 36 points. ‘

“Our defense deﬁnitely created our of-
fense today, and I think that really showed
in our points on offense off of turnovers,”
Berenato said. I
