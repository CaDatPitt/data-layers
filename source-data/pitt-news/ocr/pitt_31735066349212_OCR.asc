Library Budget Study Slated '

BY TOM WENSTON

An investigation and analysis
of complaints from the Senate

/rlribrary, Committee concerning

§’atlarics of library employes and
proposed budget cuts is needed,
Chancellor Wesley Posvar said at
Friday's University Senate meet-
ing. ,

Posvar said Vice Chancellor for
Planning and Budget Jack Free-
man will direct an investigation
comparing the operations and
expenditures of Pitt's library
system to those of 12 other
universities.

“I am disturbed by the informa-
tion in the Library Committee's
report," Posvar said. “I also feel
perplexity about what the situation
in the libraries is now." ~

,9-..:l‘he Library Committee's com-

‘ b

, Research Libraries

.-...,,2"~;tints. presented at the Senate

Council meeting November 10,
involved reports that of the_87
members of the Association of
(ARL), Pitt
ranked last in beginning salaries
for professional employes, and 67th
for median salaries.

Also coming under fire from the
Library Com-mittecpwere the
budget .euts planned by Pitt
administrators over the next five

years. despite the rising cost of

library material.

“The Office for Planning and
Budget will make a profile of the
expenditures of _the libraries,”
Posvar said. “We’ll then compare
them with expenditures of a dozen
other ‘universities. ~ .

“A study of salaries by the Office
of Business and Finance will
compare the salaries of Pitt library

employes to salaries at the dozen‘

other universities.

“We're looking at a vital
institution," Posvar added. “The
librariesat Pitt are important for
the University and the com-
’munity." ,

In other business. the Senate
passed a resolution to send to the
Board of Trustees a set of proposed
guidelines outlining. opportunities
for tenure stream status for
part-time faculty members.

"The fully qualiﬁed person
entering the University at the rank
of instructor or assistant professor
whose only limitation is in
availability of time may, upon
request, be considered for appoint-
ment to thetenure stream faculty
on a part-time basis." professor
Richard C. Tobias said.

“They should be considered full
members of the _faculty of the
University will all the rights and
responsibilities of such faculty."

Student Basketball Seat 1 

Allocation Remains Samen

BY DAVE KIRSHNER

Two hundred “no-show” tickets
have been implemented into the
student basketball ticket allocation
this year, according to Dr. Kenneth
Metz, chairman of the ad-hoc
committee dealing with ticket
problems.

’The announced plans for the-

distribution and allocation of

basketball tickets are similar to last .

year’s, except for the additional
200 tickets. This season, 2,600
student tickets will be available,
although there are only 2,400
student seats.

_ Metz explained in a written
proposal that the “no-show”
tickets are a reaction to the small
percentage of no-shows at most
games. A

“This system is essentially what

we used at the end of last

asketball season," Metz said.

“We found it to be the most
successful." ‘

According to the proposed
system, tickets for basketball
games will be distributed from the
Student Affairs ticket booth on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral. '
Tickets will be made available on
the day before the date of the game
and. on the day of the game.

The ticket booth will be open

according to the following sched-
ule:—The day “before the game-—
4:30-8:30 p.m. '

The day of the game—l0 a.ni.-_ I ' 

game time (8 p.m.)

For Saturday and Monday

games, the ticket office will be
open on: Thursday before. the
game—4:30-8:30 p.m. V
Friday before the game——l0 a.m.-S
p.m. . .
Game day—_-10 a.m.-game time

The system calls for students to
present student IDs and current
validations when obtaining their
tickets.
will be accepted.

According to Field House Ticket
Manager Mel Cratsley, this system
has several strong points.

“People will know ahead of time. ‘

whether they’ can get in or not," he
said. “We won't be closing doors
in anyone's face.” ’

Metz said his committee feels

that» the system, « with the 2001-“ 
additional tickets, “will providefor.  '

greater student access to the sell-
out game and still presefve the
normal safety standards regarding
crowd control."

He also said the system will not
require coupons.

FAS Kills Tenure Changes

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS), killed two proposed changes
in the tenure procedures of its
school last week, including the
Schulman Resolution, by an 18-66
vote. _ Also rejected “was an
amendment by Jonathan Harris
and Herbert Chestler that was
defeated, 36-56.

The current system provides for
departmental elections for tenure
and promotion candidates, gwith
veto power held by the FAS"
Dean Jerome Rosenberg.

.The. Schulman Resolution would
have substituted a three-level
review ‘of tenure and promotion
cases. first at the departmental
level. followed by a review by
experts and a panel comprised of
faculty elected from University-
wide departments.

Thepanel was to be drawn from
a standing committee that would
advise Rosenberg on the short- and
long-range goals of the school. -.

The FAS is the largest faculty‘

body at Pitt, comprising 629 faculty
positions. - .

“I think it indicates that the
faculty isn't too unhappy with the
present tenure procedures," Ros-
enberg said.

“Of course the matter isn't over
yet. Someone else "can bring up
another resolution, and the Univer-'
sity Senate has parts of the Tenure
Report on its agenda, but as of now
nothing is before us; we have a
clean slate." . . ‘ I ,

Associate professor of history
lrwiii Schulman. the author. ofthe

ehiil
2" " V ._

          

, cqtijiinented his.

       

“This makes Pitt the only school
I've been to that doesn't have a
committee of faculty to advise the
clean on tenure matters,” Schul-
man said, “But we've had a very
good discussion of the matter, and
the vote indicates to me that the
faculty is satisﬁed with the status
quo."

Schulman speculated that the
defeat of his resolution came about
as a reaction to the defeat of the
amendment by Harris and Chest-
ler, which had received support
from the Pitt Professional Union,
one of the organizations involved in
developing a faculty union on
campus.

“I suspect that basically the
more conservative faculty voted
down my_resolution and that the
more radical faculty voted down my
resolution because they couldn’t

agree with it, following the defeat '
of their amendment.

Associate professor of economics
Chestler, one of the cosponsors of
the Chestler-Harris Amendment,
said there was confusion over the
change in tenure procedures, and
that it was viewed by some as an
issue involving unionization.

“We were accused of politieizing
the University," Chestler said,
“when all we said‘ was that there
was potentially differing views on
the needs of the school.

“The procedures fortenure and p

the question of faculty unionization
are two distinct» problems. I
\\'0.1ll(lll"l say the vote against our
ameiidnteiit wa‘

'mt;e~. It: s’ too’ simplistic a. label

     

  
 
    

_, a g conseif*vative_'t_ ,

The Harris-Chestler Amendment
provided for a single pool of
faculty, elected in numbers of up to
two for each department,”'—from
which the faculty member, the

dean "and the advisory committee g 

itself would appoint two members

to review all promotion and tenure » ‘

decisions in the school.

The Harris-Chestler Amendment '

differs from the Schulman Resolu-
tion in that it makes no provision

for studies on short- and long- "

range goals of the school in terms
of employment, Chestler ‘said.

The FAS Council is slated to hold . .

a post mortem meeting on the

defeat ofthe Schulman Resolution ‘- 
and Harris-Chestler Amendment‘

this week. _

Pinter's ‘Homecoming’

Ignites Family Setting

BY DAVID ASHLEY

“...A door can open at any
moment and someone will come in.
We’d love to know who it is, we’d
love to know exactly what he has on
his mind and why he comes in, but
how often do we know what
someone has on his mind or who
this somebody is...?”

—Harold Pinter.

In The Homecoming, the third of
Pinter's longer plays, a man and a
woman arrive at a shabby house in
North London. Teddy is returning
to his old home with his wife Ruth
after spending six years as a
college professor in the United
States. The house is occupied by
his father, Max, his Uncle Sam,
and his two brothers, Lenny and
Joey.

With the exception of Sam, the
neat and decorous chaffeur who
strives to distance himself from the
brute physicality of his kin, the
occupants of this house are
repulsive in their animality. As
Teddy's family begins to interact
with his wife, whose existence was
unknown to them, strange patterns
of exchange are generated.

Lenny makes a perverse play for
Ruth as he tells her of a diseased
prostitute he once beat up and an
old woman he abused. Ruth,
unruffled by Lenny’s brand of sex
and violence. reciprocates by
provoking him erotically, referring
to him as “Leonard," a form of
address peculiar to his dead
mother. Jessie. When Max is
introduced to his daughter-in-law,
he describes her as “a smelly
scrubber...a stinking pox-ridden
slut." Since Jessie died. he
explains, “I've never had a whore
under this roof before." Later, as
the feebleminded Joey observes
Ruth's immodest position on the

inoldcring armchair, he shouts to.
Max: “Christ. she's wide open.
Dad. look at that. She's a tart."
With his sister-in-law's acqui-
csccnscc and under 'l'cd(l_\"s
impassivc stare, he proceeds to
(lr_y—hump hcr upon a Ilea—bitten
couch while Lenny strokes her hair.
The play culminates with the
family (Teddy included) suggesting
that Ruth remain in the house while
her husband returns to America.
Lenny addes helpfully that he will
set her up under his tutelage as a
whore in Greek Street so that she
can augment the family's income.

The rest of the time, Ruth can coo‘;-"“,._.

and clean out for them—and keep
the family satisﬁed. After forcing a
few concessions from Lenny about
business matters, Ruth agrees to
the new arrangement.

The play ends with Max, on his

‘knees. whimpering before Ruth:

“l'm.not an old man...Do you hear
mc?...Kiss me." Joey's head is in
her lap while Lenny looks on
hungrily. The ‘‘Homecoming'’ is
Ruth's not her husband's.

How does an audience begin to
understand this bizarre family and
this improbable turn of events‘?
Pinter does not give us “objective"
biographies for the characters he
introduces in any of his works. The

information given is invarib,1;“‘f

ambiguous. The subjects them-
selves struggle to distinguish
between fact. and their own
projected fantasies. Plot becomes
secondary to language, which is
controlled by the playwright with
craftmanslike precision.

The elliptical nature of a Pinter
script, notated with pauses and
silences,.is not designed to confuse
the audience. Pinter may be
concerned with the subconscious
mind as much as conscious reality,
but his plays are nevertheless
profoundly realistic. The success
or failure of a Pinterian production

hinges upon the audience's abilit_,u.,\_

to experience what the subjects 
feeling—to become part of their

order, which only from the
“outside" seems so perverse.
It is therefore a stroke of

brilliance that in the Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theatre's Production of
The Homecoming, under the
direction of Bill Royston, the
audience of 18 people is ushered
into the family's large living room,
where they take their seats around
the perimeter of this space only a
few feet away from Lenny, who

DeJong said. “Particularly astron-
omy, because the physics depart-
ment has been able to hire several
astrophysicists. Following the
merger, they became part of our
section.”

According to DeJong, no compli-.

cations have resulted from joining
of the two departments.

“There will remain separate
tracks within the department,” he
said. “Admissions committees and

examination procedures Wlll re-
main entirely separate.”

DeJong also explained that the
impact of the merger on students is
not particularly great because for
the last two years students had
been able to take courses from both
departments.

He also said the existence of the
combined department has in no
way_ affected students who are

NEW YORK (AP)—.Iohn D. ‘ I

Ehrlichman, one-time aide to

- Richard M. Nixon, says the report

by a‘ Senate Committee on

Intelligence on. CIA operations is an _ I  

example of second guessing.

In an interview in Newsweek
magazine, Ehrlichman said the
report, which disclosed a number
of, CIA murder plans
foreign ofﬁcials, was an example of
failure to view events in context.

“The press, courts and public
opinion have a hard time measur-
ing events in context. They tend to
measure the past in terms of the
present. It almost amounts to
situational ethics of a perverse
kind,” he said.

‘ End of Sexual B'as
An effective implementation of the provisions of Title IX of the 1972
Education Amendments willprovide Pitt students with equal learning
opportunities regardless of sex.
The title addresses itself particularly to student discrimination in

programs and activities that receive federal assistance.
Pitt Afﬁmtative Action Director Maryann Bishop has said the

. University ﬁrst must locate the areas of sexual bias and then devise

means to overcome them. I

Depending on what the investigators ﬁnd, successful implementa-
tion may step on a lot of toes.

We hope ofﬁcials take a particularly close look at physical education

- classes, athletic programs, student admissions and educational hiring.
' These areas have proven to be the trouble spots in many schools’

compliance with Title IX across the country.

No matter how thorough a study is conducted, various cases of
sexual discrimination undoubtedly will be overlooked. Because of this,
we hope those who have been the victims of discrimination come
forward to.report unfair practices.

Whether the problem stems from an academic area or from extra

— curricular activity, male and female students now are guaranteed by
. - . law the right to the same opportunities at an educational institution
?- . ﬁnancially supported by the government.

The time it takes a student to ‘report an act of discrimination to the
University is practically nil compared to the centuries it’s taking to
enact this country's promise of social equality.

Now that we have the laws, let’s use them.

 Great Panther Season

4  There is little for Pitt fans to be sullen about with this year’s regular

football season over. . . j
The Panthers have had their best season in more than a decade. We

have a well-rounded team and some nationally known stars who can '

come through in a clutch. After starting from scratch on a 1-10, 2-9

. reputation, the coaches, players and fans have plenty to be proud of in

building so formidable an adversary in so short a time.
In light of the ups and downs of both Pitt and Penn State this season,
to claim that the Nittany Lions beat the Panthers, even by one point, is

V to make a rash judgment.

The sound thrashing of Notre Dame opened a _new era in Panther
football. Pitt’s clear domination of Penn State cannot be set aside on;
the paltry oounter-evidence of a mere point. We now have a spirited
team that is in major contention for national honors. No one next year
will take the Panthers lightly.

' It’s ironic that a team whose scoring has relied so-much on individual
performance (i.e., Dorsett, Walker, Jones) should lose its season’s
ﬁnale through an individual. a

But Carson Long has nothing of which to be ashamed. The great

I majority of his kicks are right on target, and he ‘certainly has been a

factor in the swift rise of the Panthers. 2

Those who have harsh words for him because of his unsuccessful
booting Saturday are like the same fair weather fans who deserted 10
years ago. It’s unfortunate, however, that like public glory, public
rebuke also is concentrated on the individual. The players we most
heartily applaud, like Tony Dorsett, never will have to bear Long’s
burden, and for this we can but admire long more than we can the
others. —

Defeat, if you wish to call it that, never comes under such singular
terms, like one point or one man. Defeat takes on huge proportions,
like the game statistics that showed Penn State losing to the Panthers.
Or the thousands of long faces that streamed out of Three Rivers
Stadium—but that was self-defeat. ‘

The Pitt Panthers have known little defeat this year. And the
“victory over Penn State” editorial we had planned for this space will
just be ﬁled away, since we’re conﬁdent we’ll use it next season.

The Panic of Thanksgiving,  

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

With Thanksgiving only a few

_days away, we all should fold our

heads and bow our hands in thanks
for those things for which we
should be thankful. Now for just
what should we be thankful? I
suppose we could be thankful that

Pittsburgh is not New Jersey, or

that Tiny Tim is not Wesley Posvar.
But Ifor one am thankful that I am
not a turkey.

The oppression of turkeys is a lot

’ more serious than one maythink.

Sure, millions of Americans stuff
themselves on the big birds every
year, but we have been brainwash-
ed into thinking that the turkeys
happily accept their fate, satiating
themselves with the pleasures of
overeating before being painlessly
killed. One would think the turkeys
do not know any better. Nothing
could be further from the truth.

My investigation of the Acme

turkey farm began when I ﬁrst

i heard rumors of the oppression of

turkeys there. I wanted ﬁrsthand
information, but I could not let on
to thelowner of the farm what my
true intentions were, so I masquer-
aded as a reporter for a farming
magazine, doing research on
turkey farming. It worked, and I
was given free run of the farm. The
following is my report.

THE PLACE

The farm. consists of five
buildings, two long narrow build-
ings that house the turkeys, an
ofﬁce building, a slaughtering

Zionism and the Arab Loss

BY BILL KALMAN

Jack Romberg, in a recent
column appearing here, attacked
the U.N. vote on Zionism as a
denial of the national rights of the
Jewish people. This attack is
off-base.

Zionism, from the very begin-
ning, was expounded by Theordor
Herzl as a means of colonizing an
“empty area” in the colonial
world, enslaving or driving out the
nonwhite, non-European popula-
tio'n..When in the 1930s Zionist
colonization began, Palestine was
overwhelmingly Arab. Settlement
was undertaken under the slogans:

“Conquest of the Land,” “Con-
quest of the Labor,” and “Pro-
duce of the Land.”

David Hacohen, a leader of
Golda Meir’s party (the Mapai
party)’ described this policy as fol-
lows: ~_“I would not accept—Arabs in
my trade union, (the Histadrut) [or]
buy at Arab stores...we stood
guard at orchards to prevent Arab

 vavorkersafrom getting jobs there, '

poured kerosene on Arab tomatoes,
attacked Jewish housewives in the
markets and smashed the Arab
eggs they had bought...”

David Ben Gurion, first Israeli
prime minister, was frank about
the “need" to drive out the Arabs.
“Our aim," he stated, “is to make
Israel as Jewish as.England is Eng-
lish.” The majority of Palestinians
were driven out beginning in No-
vember,’ 1947, a process com-
pleted by the outbreak of the 1948
war. On December 31, 1947, the
Zionist organization Irgun bombed
the Haifa oil reﬁnery, the only
installation hiring Arabs and Jews.
On April 17, 1948, the Arab village
of Der Yaseen was destroyed and
the bodies of 245 men, women and
children were thrown down a well.
On April 29, the inhabitants of
Katamon were butchered. By May
of 1948. prior to the war ‘between
Israel and the Arab states, 22 Arab
villages outside the area the United
Nations had voted as a “Jewish
zone" in November, 1947, were

attacked ‘by the Irgun or E the .
.. Hasaanah (tbs. l§r?91i,-atmyi-.Th¢

Hagannah dropped leaﬂets in Arab
areas warning, “all people who do
not want this war must leave toge-
ther with their women and child-
ren to be safe." It was the Zionists
who drove out the Palestinians.

Arabs living in Israel have been
and are second-class citizens. For
years.. legal restrictions are im-
posed against Arab membership in
trade unions, attendance at uni-
versities and voting. Though some
of the legal restrictions have been
lifted, discrimination against
Arabs continues.

Romberg urges the Arabs to ac-
cept a West Bank state, as if the
Arabs were the obstacle. But in any
case, this would be a denial of
the rights of those Arabs driven
out of Israel in 1947-1948 and those
living as second-class citizens in Is-
rael today. Only a renunciation of
Jewish exclusiveness and the end-

ing of the domination .by Zionist

organizations such’ as the Histad-

rut, the Israeli army and the 'Ma- ,

pai party,can'pave the way for_ jus-
tice for the Palestinians. And this is
what -the U.N. -resolution —is_ all

. . about.. : .

house and a packing house. The
land surrounding the farm is very
plush and green, but the plight of
the turkeys is obvious from the
beginning. Their houses are long,
narrow and very _dirty (no one
cleans up after them). Further, the
turkeys are never allowed out of
their pens, so they are kept
ignorant of the rest of the farm.
Above, the door of the slaughter-’
ing house is a plaque reading “Old
turkeys never die’, they just quietly
fade away.” Every year in the
weeks preceding Thanksgiving,

' thousands of the oldest and fattest

turkeys are taken into the houseto
be killed. The turkeys never realize
they are to be killed until too late,
as they are told that they are
merely being moved into a more
luxurious setting, because they
have grown so old and fat.

The result is that the turkeys
fight for food, because if they can
get fat faster, they will be able to
leave their dirty, crowded pens.

THE PREJUDICE

The attitude of the humans
toward the turkeys is best summed
up by one of the slaughterers.

“Turkeys are basically stupid
creatures,” he said. “All they do
is complain about their pens.” He
paused to smash the head of a
waiting, unsuspecting turkey with
a mallet. .

" “Do you always kill them in one
stroke?” I asked.

He answered no, so I asked why
he did not use a less painful
method of killing turkeys. He gave
me a dirty look and muttered, “I’m
a butcher, not a surgeon.” So I
left.

One of the feeders was more
helpful. I asked him why the
secrecy about the slaughtering
house was necessary, and he told
me of some recent trouble the farm
had been having with the turkeys.
It seems that not too long ago, one
of the turkeys was able to sneak out
of the pen and witness fa" killing.

The next day when one ‘of the,

feeders went into the pen, the
turkeys rioted and he had to be
rescued by a squad of armed men.

Now there is an extra fence
inside each turkey house. While
this allows men to enter and feed
the turkeys-without touching them,
it has created "more crowded
conditions for the turkeys.

THE REVOLUTION

By far the most enlightening part
of my visit was when I went into
one of the turkey houses. At first I
thought the fence would prevent
me from talking to the turkeys, or

' that they would be afraid of me, but

as soon as they found out who I
was, they crowded around the
fence to talk.

The turkeys told me they know
they are being killed in the building
next door. Most do not believe

anything men tell them: Atﬁrsﬁ. 

some of the more radical turkeys
protested by not eating, hoping to
preserve their lives to prove to
other turkeys what was going on.
But the head feeder found out
about this and weeded out ‘these
radicals and slaughtered them
anyway. The result was that the
radical movement was discredited
and many people got particularly
thin turkeys for dinner.

One turkey told -me turkeys
wouldn’t mind providing our
Thanksgiving meals if only“ they
were treated decently while alive.
He told me that in the old days.

turkeys considered the hunt a fair __
way to go. It matched skill agarnsa 5.3’,

skill, and if the turkey lost, he knew
that a bullet was quicker and less
painful than getting smashed in the
head.

While there are still some
turkeys who believe they will move
on to ﬁner’ living quarters, the
Turkey Re-education and Action
Program (TRAP), is fast gaining
followers. The turkeys are moving
to liberate themselves, but they
need our help. ,

So I, for one, am thankful not to
be a turkey. On Thursday, I will
show my support for the cause by
having fish for dinner: "But before I
forget, Happy Thanksgiving. And

-most important: Turkeys of the

world, ‘unite.

Can $11 Make a Magazine?

ltl l\'ATHRt’N KIMBALL

Is it possible to run a student
literary magazine when all you've
got is 600 copies of last year's
edition. a small office and $11?

That's what the people on this
year's Ideas and «Figures staff are
trying to find out. And they aren't
just trying to keep the magazine
alive. They want to publish two
issues this year instead of one.

But why is the magazine in such
a disheveled condition?

When last year's staff dissolved,
it neglected to apply to the
Allocations Committee for addi-
tional funding, which left this
year's optimistic crew with no
budget at all.‘ V

"Student Government is not
allocating any more money, but

English writing major on this
year's staff said.

in the meantime. the staff

earned $ll from the sale of last
year's magazine, not much of a
sum with which to work. The only
thing the staff can do right now is
judge submissions. So far, -it has
received only three.

"A guy came in a couple of
weeks ago with a whole folder of
manuscripts. but when he saw the
condition ofthc office and heard we
had no money. he wouldn't leave
them." said sophomore English

writing major Alex Levin.

"The condition of the office"

painted on the walls, including
various obscenities and the word
“dada." 7

“Last year's» staffers were into
dadaism. an anti-art destruction
and recreation movement." Levin
said.

They dubbed their publication
"an illiterary magazine."

The present staff is determined,
however, not so much to salvage
the student magazine as to start a
new one from scratch.

“In the past, the Ideas and
Figures staffs have chosen to blow
their entire allocation on a single
slick paper extravaganza," Levin

‘said. “We have decided to spread

the money out. If our allocation
comes through we intend to, put out
one magazine in February and one
in April.”

Women Netters Fall
In Quarterfinal Play  

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette volleyball team

‘ was eliminated in the quarterﬁnals

of the Regional Volleyball Compe-
tition on Friday, by the University 0
Maryland, 15-2, 16-4. «

Carrying an 18-2 regular season
record into the competition at New
Haven, Pitt placed ﬁfth among 16
teams. _ ‘

The Pantherettes had played
first—ranked Maryland during Fri-
day’s round robin competition and
had lost, 15-4,‘ 15-11. . But by
defeating Central Connecticut and
East Stroudsburg, Pitt qualiﬁed for
the winners’ bracket, which con-
sisted of the top eight teams.

In Saturday’s quarter-ﬁnals, the
Pantherettes once again faced
Maryland. The Terrapins, who
play 40 games during the regular
season (twice as many as the
Pantherettes), had the added edge
of experience and Pitt succumbed’
to it. .

“Wereally gave them a ﬁght in
the second game," Pantherette
-Head Coach Mary Kromer said.

“There were comments made to
me from other coaches that we

that will be performed by the Pitt
Aquaettes tonight.

The Aquaettes are Pitt‘s sy_n- '

chronized-swim team class‘ club.

Every year the -team plans two .

water shows, one during the
holidays and one in the spring.
Tonight’s show, “Holiday
Dreams,” encompasses everything
from stripping turkeys to bubbling

Franceto a Thanksgiving prayer.

pool. O A _ _, .
Besides putting on water shows,

. the Aquaettes participate in AAU

competition.

“This is our eighth year in
competition," said Coach .Virginia
Grindle. 1 “We competed in our
first Midwest Intercollegiate _meet
two years ago andtctook eighth

. place."-

‘‘It takes time, practice and a
special dedication to keep _up this
skilled level." * . . _ '

— were the only team ever to rattle

Maryland. We weren’t totally
dominated; the experience Mary-
land had made the difference.

‘‘I think it was a highly
successful season. They’re a

‘tremendously dedicated group. I

was extra proud of their showing
throughout the season and during
the Regionals——-they’re no longer
amateurs,” Kromer said.

And though the season ended
with a defeat, the Pantherettes
have every reason to feel pride in,
their accomplishments. i

With the completion of their
second year as a team, they’ve
improved consistently. In ’74, they
ﬁnished the regular season 14-3,
and made the consolation bracket
competition at the Regionals.

This year, playing an expanded
schedule, they ﬁnished with an
overall record of 18-2 and in the
upper third of the best volleyball
teams in the East. -

And so, in view of_ these
accomplishments, it's probably
demeaning to pull out that ﬁnal
cliche of high-school sports writers.

Apologies to you, Pantherettes-
but'there’s always next year.

wet, rainy nights in Pitt Stadium,

Akron. the lady who kept shouting

  Harriers Off To State

The Pitt cross country team
meets the nation’s ﬁnest runners
today at Penn State in the NCAA

strong third-place ﬁnish in the
greatly respected Central Colleg-

‘ along with Washington Stat_e, Penn »

es, Holds Off Pitt,

and picked off a pass from the
stumbling State offense.

Dominated most of the game,
that is. . . i

The fourth quarter saw the Lions
put together a typical State drive:
time-consuming, with most plays
on the ground.

Finally with a fourth down and a
few inches for a ﬁrst on the Panther
28. halfback Steve Geise hit the
center of the line and bounced
outside to daylight and six points.
Placekicker Chris Bahr booted the
extra point and the Nittany Lions
had another victory.

As usual, or so it seemed.

“Pitt has overplayed Geise,”
Paterno said. “He was going for
the ﬁrst down and if he got some
room to the outside he was
supposed to move out.” They were
in a short yardage defense and left
the outside open.”

But the Panthers showed they"

were still full of ﬁght after the Lion
score.

The Panthers were to get within
Long ﬁeld goal range three times in

the next ﬁve minutes, onlyyto be_

tossed aside for inexplicable
reasons. _

“It just seemed like it wasn't our
day," said Panther Head Coach
Johnny Majors. “I’m' not taking
anything away from Penn State;
they played a heck of a game. In
fact, it was the hardest hitting,_ best
defensive game I think I’ve ever
seen.” "

Following the State TD, quarter-

back Matt Cavanaugh, who played -

“superbly,” in Paterno’s eyes,
guided the Cats to the State 34,
from where Long tried a 51-yard
ﬁeld goal. The kick was right on
the money but a bit short.

Taking’ over, Lion QB Chuck
Fusina, only a freshman, wasugang
tackled and fumbled the ball to

the prc-football game matches and
the like? 1
, Despite a _5-7-2 season record,
the Panthers have played very well.
“As a team," Head Coach Leo
Bemis said, “we had our peaks and
valleys. Some times we rose to the
occasion."

They sure did. Some of the more
memorable moments were the tie
with Akron, the exciting yet tough
1-0 loss to defense-minded Buck-
nell. a 1-1 tie with always powerful
Davis and Elkins and a disappoint-
ing 2-1 loss to Temple.

As for the valleys, there were a
few, but it's interesting to note that
of the seven losses, three came
against NCAA playoff-bound teams
like Penn State, Bucknell and NAIA
playoff-bound Slippery Rock, not to
mention two losses to playoff-
hungry, West Virginia and Temple
.(once ‘ranked , fourth in the

sey poll).. i

. The‘defense_ was mighty respec-
table. Pitt gave up only 25 goals in
the 14 ‘games, an average of 1.78
per game. four of them shutouts.
This was because of the tough play

of goalie Frank Bucci (named to the

West Penn Collegiate All-Star
Team) and backs Andy Behrend,
Chris Connolly, Kim Blasko, Mark
Gannon. Ernie Gross and Mark

Not only have the younger Pitt

“We should be capable of

“We can have a better team-with-

The seniors naturally will be
sorely missed. Jutca, Morahari;

Grove City win was dedicated,

BREAST, CANCER FINDINGS

The University Health Center of
Pittsburgh's Breast Cancer Detec-
tion Center (BCDC), which official-
ly opened last November. has is-
sued a report ofthe ﬁndings on the
5,649 women who were screened
during its first year of operation.

The Center also announced‘fund-
ing has been awarded to continue
the project for a second year.

Established to demonstrate the
efficacy of various methods of
breast cancer detection, the BCDC,
3515 Fifth Ave., is one of 29
such facilities in the United States
funded by the National Cancer
Institute and the American Cancer
Society. Dr. Bernard Fisher, di-
rector of oncology at the Health
Center and professor of surgery in
Pitt’s School of Medicine, is di-
rector of the BCDC.

Screening examinations are of-
fered at no cost to asymptomatic
women. ages 35-75, in the Western
Pennsylvania and tri-state area,
with particular emphasis placed on
recruiting women who might not.
otherwise seek such an examina-
tion. As of September, 1975,
of the first 5,400 women screened,
13 cases of breast cancer were de-
tected. Of those 13 women, four
were in the 39-50 age group,
ﬁve were in the 51-60 age group,
and four were over 60.

“The 13 malignancies detected
represented approximately 0.2% of

“However, we must emphasize
that the women screened were
asymptomatic and therefore may
not be representative of the re-
gion’s female population. We con-
tinue to stress the importance of
yearly examinations, and breast
self-examinations for women of all '
ages, especially those who may
have a family history of breast
cancer. Any woman who suspects
she has a problem should see her
own doctor immediately.”
' During the next year an addi-
tional 5,000 women will be
screened. The total of 10,000 wo-
men will return annually for five
years for follow-up screening. The
ultimate goal of the project is to
determine which women are most
prone to developing breast cancer.
