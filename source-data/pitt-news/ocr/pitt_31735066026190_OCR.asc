Klayman suspendedfor embezzlement

Co-conspirators must return the $4,000 and are suspended for one semester to one year

Anthony Breznican

Editor in Chief

Gerald Klayman, the man who once
controlled ftmding for all Pitt student
groups, has been suspended from school for
three years after the University Judicial
Board found him guilty of embezzling
thousands of dollars from the student activ-
ities fund last year.

Klayman conspired with live other stu-
dents —~ one of whom has since graduated

“I hope they’ve learned an important
lesson,” said Gallagher.

As part of their sentence, the students
must return all of the money they stole,
according to Gallagher.

Among the other students found guilty
is Alfred Gaspari, who is Klay1nan’s room-
mate and the president of the’ Panther
Automobile Lovers Club —— one of the
phony organizations created as a way to
funnel money to the conspirators.

Pitt suspended Gaspari for one year,
according to sources in the student govem—
ment. The University suspended the other
three students still enrolled for either a
semester or a year, depending on the extent
of their involvement in the fraud, according

to Gallagher.

He said the student who has graduated
must return the money and has not been
punished.

University employees are forbidden to
reveal the names of the students involved
due to privacy laws. Many student mem-
bers claimed to know nothing about those
charged, and have refused to comment
about the sentencing.

Neither Klayman nor Gaspari returned
numerous messages left at their home.

Gallagher said that although criminal
charges could be ﬁled against the students,
the University will seek no further punish-
ment.

“Once we made the decision to go with
our Judicial Board, we felt that justice
would be reasonably served,” he said.
“Perhaps we could have gone further but I
feel that
we handled it fairly and that those involved
—— including us — have learned something
from this very unhappy experience.”

Staff writer
Aaron ‘Smith thinks a lot of people

stay away from art because they are L

intimidated by it.

“I think there’s this idea out there
that art can’t be done, that it is something
outside of ourselves,” he said.

But Smith, who is the resident direc-
tor of Schenley Quad, said he feels that

exposing students to art will make them

more comfortable with it —-—- and, he
hopes, more eager to explore it.
That is the idea behind the Arts in

the Residence Halls program that Smith .

directs. It is a program that brings differ-
ent kinds of art into the dorms to make it
more accessible to students.

The sixth instalhnent of the program
was held in McCormick Hall last night
with a combination poetry reading and
art exhibit. Smith worked with sopho-
more Matthew‘ Novak and freshman
Elizabeth Pearson to organize the event,
which drew more than 50 students.
Some read their poetry aloud while oth-
ers chose to listen. Several student artists
also showed off their works of painting
and sculpting. A .

There was art to appeal to the ears as
well as the eyes. Pitt student Phil Boyd
entertained the group with music from
his guitar and harmonica. He played two
songs, “Cramps in Your Foot” and
“Black-Clad Country Love,” both of
which he wrote.

Recently, the Provost’s Office began
to give ﬁnancial support to the event,

allowing the organizers to offer prize
money to’ the winning artists. The $50
first prize went to poet Matt Wilson.
Margot Douaihy and Phil Boyd each
won one of the two $25 second prizes.

Karen Themstrup, one of the judges,
enthusiastically said she was impressed
with Mike Romani, Matt Wilson and all
the other poets who read.

“This is amazing,” she said. “I’m
really encouraged by the level of creativ-
ity and artistic expression these students
are showing.”

Themstrup, a painter and poet, is an

'M.F.A. student of poetry and instructor

of the Introduction to Poetry class. She
has read her own work at
Hemmingway’s and Barnes and Noble,
and has shown her paintings at the South
Side Gallery Women’s Work.

Smith eagerly agreed with
Themstrup’s critique of the event.

“This is incredible,” he said. “The
event is blowing me away. The students’
enthusiasm to express themselves and
the quality of that expression is amaz-
mg.”

Past events have offered students the
opportunity to meet several well-known
poets. Irene McKinney, the poet laureate
of West Virginia, and Toi Derricotte, a
widely published poet and instructor at
Pitt, have made appearances.

Poet Margot Douaihy called the
event a “gift to the students.”

“I give so much credit to the school
and the RAs for giving us the chance to

see the talents of other students,” she 

said.

LOS ANGELES— Iitanic won 11 Oscars
last night, including best picture — tying
the record set by Ben Hur in 1960. Among
the blockbuster ﬁlm’s other awards: best
director for James Cameron, original song,
original score, ﬁlm editing and art direction.
Jack Nicholson picked up his third

LA HABRA, Calif. — Police say they
have a man in custody who suffocated a
young boy, cut his body into pieces, encased
some of the remains in concrete chunks and
then scattered them

They say they’re not sure how John
Ghobrial could have done all that, because
he has only one arm.

Police had originally arrested seven

9 people in connection with the case, but now

they’ve released six of them.

A police captain in La Habra says some
of the remains of sixth-grader Juan Delgado
were found in two blocks of concrete. And
one of those blocks weighed 200 pounds.

Police say they don’t have the evidence
to suggest a second person was involved.

Ghobrial is charged with murder. He
faces arraignment today.

The boy was last seen at school on
Tuesday. He was reported missing
Thursday. His mother said he’d been
known to stay away from home for days at
a time.

A man found one of the concrete
blocks on his property Saturday, and found
blood oozing from it.

conclusion.

Gallagher said his only regret was that
prosecution of the students “took longer
than hoped.” -

He said he expects the students who

received short suspensions will return to

Pitt but that someone suspended for three
years will “probably graduate somewhere
else.”

_ Klayman — who was a senior this year
— may enroll in another school, but in most
cases only about 60 credits will transfer to
another college.

The fraud began to unravel after all 10
members of the allocations board resigned
last September to protest a misuse of funds
by then-SGB President Justin DalMolin.

The members questioned DalMolin’s
numerous summer business trips in which
he stayed at luxury hotels, spent exorbitant
amounts of money on food, and rented a
Lincoln Town Car. As Allocations
Committee chair, Klayman signed off on
these items without the approval of the
other committee members.

DalMolin maintained that the expenses
were legitimate, but he and Klayman were
criticized by students and Pitt administra-
tors for the spending.

‘Though [DalMolin’s] judgments
were out of line, the spending was not out
of the boundaries of what was allowable,”
Gallagher said.

But while signing olf on DalMolin’s
expenses, Klayman also began funnelling
money to himself and others by creating
bogus organizations‘ and signing off on
expenses. Most of this activity occurred
during the summer, when most the student
government members were away, accord-
ing to Gallagher.

At that time, the allocations chair could
approve any expense under $500 at the
time. Because of this incident, the
University has since changed that policy.
Advisers must now examine almost all
expenses from the student government.

The students were able to take ﬂie
money by requesting funding for speakers
who either never spoke or were not the

T experts they purported to be, according to

Gallagher. The students also forged receipts
for recruitment dinners for their false orga-
nizations.

An investigation by Pitt auditors and
the Pitt Police uncovered this evidence in
December after newspapers reported on the

 

conspiracy and SGB members asked the
Oflice of Student Activities to look into the
matter.

Early 1998

The University Judicial
Board found Klayman,

for their involvement in

Making himself
look guilty

Bill Clinton might have rrrade a big mistake
last Friday when he claimed executive privilege for
two of his aides — Bruce Lindsey and Sidney
Blumenthal — to protect them from having to tes-
tify in the Paula Jones proceedings.

Executive privilege is an optionafforded the
president so he can protect information which, if it
were released, would seriously cripple the adminis-
tration. The Supreme Court aﬁirmed this right pro-
visionally in 1974, even while in the process of
denying it to Richard Nixon, who wished to use
executive privilege to keep his audio recordings
private. ,

If the current case makes it to the Supreme
Court, the court will most likely not deny the priv-
ilege to President Clinton, ‘as the case under inves-
tigation does not seem so serious as to warrant an
overriding the privilege.

The Watergate case was about a president who
was alleged to have employed several departments
of the federal government — including the FBI and
CIA — to obstruct a very serious criminal investi-
gation. The Paula Jones case is a civil dispute con-
cerning a far lesser oﬁense, and those who enjoy
comparing the two scandals should remember this
diﬁerence. . ,

But the fact ﬂrat Clinton was charged with a
lesser crime makes it all the more puzzling that he
would claim executive privilege now. The worst
thing his aides might say, if they were put on the
stand, is that he told them about some extramarital
affair of his, or that maybe one of them passed a
note to an intern in a hallway. And most of the pub-
he no longer seems to care about the case (as evi-
denced by the fact that the article about executive
privilege was buried 11 pages into The New York
Times.)

The only end this move served was to make
Clinton look guilty. And the White House advisers
who have criticized Republican leaders for saying
just this have just rrrade the adnrinistration look
even more foolish. Republicans may very well be
engaging in partisan politics, but they are still just
stating the obvious.

Executive privilege can be a court-aﬂirmed
method of obstructing justice (or rather, obstructing
an investigation, if the obstruction itself seems just).
But for Clinton to have exercised it cannot help him
inacasewheretheveryquestionathandiswhether
he has obstructed justice in the past.

waitress with a college degree, I'm
close to the edge, people.

The edge of the table? No. The
Edge, of sanity, insanity, ‘and all
things in between. Yes, that's right,
I'm ready to start looking for a Real
Job, and or make my own. The grad-
uate school applications are more or
less in, the GRE scores are, on the
whole, less than spectacular, or spec-
tacular in the wrong way, and
frankly, I'm getting a little freaked
out. If the graduate school thing
doesn't pan out, then you know
what's next. Yes, it's the time when
paranoia and poverty start stalking
the concious mind —— like two giant
stalking things.

What kind of jobs are out there
for us creative, perhaps somewhat
impractical types? I believe that's
where creativity can work for us. We
start creating our own jobs. For
example, I« know several people who
actually make a living from doing

or work con-

such things as being freelance por-
trait artists, photographers, clothes
designers and writers. The one key
ingredient of making one's own work
is simple. You
have to get up in
the morning (and
this can be loose-
ly defined, with-
in reason) and,
here's the key,
start working for

Unfortunately, in
the nascent
stages of this
supercreative
phase, you will
also have to

I personally have to play all
kinds of little tricks with my mind to
get myself motivated, but you may
be lucky enough to have the type of
mind which simply gets on with it
without having to be tricked, cajoled
and caressed into submission, in
which case you probably aren't wast-
ing precious tirne reading this. If not,
then here's some advice:

1) Getup several hours before
you go to bed. This ensures plenty of
time for ’you to work on freelance
projects.

2) Eat all meals at the same
time, and thus save several hours of
valuable time; plus, it jump-starts
your metabolism into really working
for its living as well.

3) One week contains 168
hours. Subtract 40 for your regular
job, plus commuting time. Don't you

think you should spend at least as
much time on your own work? Do
the math. Hopeless, isn't it?

4) Remember to be optimistic at
all times. Its un-
American to be a
loser.

5) If you
are a loser, make
it work for you.
Go on talk televi-
sion and talk

6) Ask
yourself this: Do
you really want
to be a loser with
a college degree
for the rest of
your life? While
this is arguably
better than being
a loser without a
college degree, isn't this in fact a
rather meaningless distinction once
the "L" word has reared its ugly head
in your own or others‘ description of

.you?

While getting a college degree is
marginally more difﬁcult than losing
one's virginity, it may be the case that
both achievements qualify one, at
least in one's own mind, as an adult.
Being, or becoming an adult, is prob-
ably a different and ongoing process
for everyone. Having the drive to go
for what you want, as opposed to tak-
ing whatever falls into your lap, has
emerged as the latest deﬁnition of
adulthood for me. If I could just do it
before I get old.

Relaxing in a soothing, warm, bubbly brown ooze

Rehan Nasir

Photo Edltor

Thursday evenings my roommate
and I try to enjoy a nice, quiet cup of tea
over a discussion of. what we want to do
in the next few months. This past
Thursday, however, was a little bit differ-
ent. '

"Roomie" as I like to call him, decid-
ed to take a bubble bath in our suite's tub.
He walked out the door with lotions and
scents neatly arranged in a little ﬂoral
basket. As the tub ﬁlled, he walked back
in to collect some candles to make his
experience perfectql, on the other hand,
sat silently on my bed, trying to ﬁgure
out what tasted so funny in my cup of tea.
Little did I know of the foreshadowing
that I held in my, hands.

Roomie came back after a few rnin-
utes. and things went something like this:

Roomie: "Rehan! Come look at this
water. It's brown." .

Me: "Huh? Are you loopy on bus

e fumes?" '

I then ventured into the bathroom to
see this spectacle for myself. The tub was
empty, so I turned the hot water on all the
way. After 30 seconds and seeing that the
water was as clear and probably as tasty
as ever, I slowly walked back into the
room. The ﬁrst thought that crossed my
mind was that maybe Roomie had
slipped and fallen and was now delusion-

Me: "The water looks as lovely as
always."

Roomie: "No. Give it some time."

Roomie and I then walked back into
the bathroom. As I looked at the tub, I
realized how horribly wrong this picture
looked. The water in the tub was a light
golden color. This color made me think
back to my days of beautiful sunsets in
Lancaster. However, much like
Lancaster, this pleasing picture had a
nasty side to it. The reality of this hit me
like that familiar smell of manure —— that
this, this water, that cleans me of
Pittsburgh each morning, is actually full
of rust, dirt, and possibly rat feces.

My first emotion was depression.
The entire concept of always being able
to take a bath on the spur of the moment
had pleased me very much. But now it
seemed that I have to drive four hours
back to Lancaster for a clean bath. Even
then, I'd have to deal with the smell of
manure permeating through the walls.

As we continued to stare at the dark-
ening mass, I tried to ﬁgure out what we
could possibly do to make things better.
After draining the tub, we noticed that the
"water" had left a brown signature.

The depression that I had previously

’ felt went away with the water. The brown

stain brought about a revelation and a
sick grin on my face that scared away my
roommate. I began to think to myself,
Self, does it really matter what color the
water is? Up until this time, you've taken

close to 200 showers and there haven't
been any side effects. And as far as the
color of the tub, won't it still do its pur-
pose if it's brown? What would have hap-
pened if the tub had been brown to
begin with? Then we would
never have realized that the
water was brown, Roomie
would be taking his bath
right now, and I'd be

something. Upon return, you see how

there's no worry here. Simply take

the beauty products, unload them
into the "water" and enjoy the
experience. Have you ever
seen brown soap bubbles?

No, of course not. That's

because they don't exist.

Over the last few weeks, many Pitt
undergraduates, several of their par-
ents, and not a few staff members with
kids of college age have asked me for
specific examples of how "tagging the
undergraduate bucks" — mandating
that income generated from, or on
behalf of, undergraduates be used
exclusively for undergraduate purpos-
es — could improve the undergraduate
lot at the University of Pittsburgh.
Here is a compelling example.

Currently, the Pitt biology depart-
ment has 28 regular tenured/tenure-
stream faculty members (this number
excludes administrative and privately
sponsored personnel). Assuming an
average two-term salary of $50,000
plus fringe beneﬁts of 29.1 percent for
each of these 28 individuals, a reason-
able but rough estimate of the cost to
the general University purse for the
tenured/tenure-stream biology faculty
is $1,807,400. In return for this money,
the University purportedly expects
each faculty member to teach the
equivalent of two three-credit under-
graduate courses per term.

The accompanying chart shows
the actual undergraduate teaching
loads of these 289 biology faculty for
the fall and spring terms of the 1997-
98 academic year (comparable charts

anticipated teaching effort is being
delivered — 36 courses/sections of
courses rather than the expected 112 .
If the University purse paid only for
the teaching it was providing, the fac-
ulty salary budget of the biology
department could be cut from
$1,807,400 to $581,700 with the
roughly $1.2 million difference being
returnable to tuition payers/subsidiz-
ers. Nor need the faculty members who
teach less than four courses per two
terms be discomﬁted —— the short fall
in their salary would be picked up by
the research contracting agenciesl grad-
uate students who represent the major
focus of those faculty members‘
University effort.

It is doubtful that the University of
Pittsburgh will remedy this sad situa— -
tion on its own. So, let's encourage the
Harrisburg Legislature to "tag the
(undergraduate) bucks)" on your
behalf. A petition to that effect can be
signed at the BioHelp Desk in the
Commons Room of the Cathedral of
Learning on Monday and Wednesday
evenings and on Tuesday afternoons
during the remainder of the term (par-
ents are very welcome).

n the
Neddy Award
goes to...

While Titanic was racking up more
awards than allowed by law at last night’s
Academy Awards, I decided to focus on
something much more important than
movies. Namely, the NCAA Tournament

I’ve made up my own set of awards,
but instead of calling them the Sesame
Street—sounding “Oscars,” I’m calling my
awards the “Neddys.” Of course, I may not
have Billy Crystal hosting my awards, but
Darryl “Chocolate Thunder” Dawkins is
next in line.

Ladies and gentlemen, the envelope
please

Best Actor: Tough call, but I’m giv-
ing my Neddy to Stanford point guard
Arthur Lee. “King Arthur,” as Dicky V.
called him, poured in 26 points against
Rhode Island and proved he could take the
Cardinal somewhere Brevin Knight never
could: the Final Four.

Best Supporting Actor: Andre Miller
of Utah registered a triple-double in Utes’
25-point upset of Arizona Miller showed
up Mike Bibby, the man most people con-
sidered to be the best point guard in the
West.

Best Director: Postgame tirade aside,
Jim Hanick almost led Rhode Island to its
ﬁrst Final Four ever.

Best Producer: Since the Neddy
Committee doesn’t understand the differ-
ence between director and producer, the
award goes to Rick Majerus, whose bril-
liant triangle-two defense stymied
Arizona’s vaunted guards and forced the
Wﬂdcats into 28-percent shooting.

Best Makeup: Kansas. With their 34-
3 record entering the tournament, the
J ayhawks looked to be a lock for the Final
Four. But Coach Roy Wﬂliarns, who con-
tinually hyped his squad, fooled us again.

Best Costumes: This Neddy was
easy. St. John’s, with its hideous maroon,
box-cut tank tops, made even Felipe
Lopez look awful. Versace would not be
proud.

Best Screen Play: Fresh off a
Mississippi upset and down by two to
Florida State, Valparaiso’s court-long pass-
and-tip play to Bryce Drew (who knocked
down a three), made the Crusaders the
tournament darlings.

Best Picture: Stanford was able to
overcome a seemingly impossible six-
point deficit to Rhode Island in the last
minute to earn their ﬁrst Final Four since
1942. A late three by Lee and subsequent
steal and lay-in by Michael Madsen gave

Championships

Pitt gymnasts Samantha
Saylers and Danielle
“Freddie” Alba came close
to perfection this past week-
end at the East Atlantic
Gymnastics League tourna-
ment.

Unfortunately, the
Panther team didn’t. Pitt ﬁn-
ished sixth in the eight-team
event, with West Virginia
taking the EAGL title.

Pitt finished with an
overall score of a 192.225.
The meet was very close in
the third through sixth spots,
with places being decided
by fractions of a point.

Saylers notched a 9.9 on
the uneven bars for the
Panthers, leading the team
in that event. Alba scored a
9.9 on the balance beam,
equalling her feat from a
week ago, when her first 9.9

of her career broke Pitt’s all-
time beam record.

“I was really proud of
them,” said Head Coach
Debbie Yohman of the two
tumblers and their team-
mates. “This ﬁnish is great
going into regiona1s.”

Pittsburgh will be host-
ing the NCAA Eastern
Regionals this year at the
Fitzgerald Field House on
Saturday, April 4.

The team’s best score of
the day came in the vault,
with the Panthers register-
ing a 48.1. For the second
week in a row, Lisa
Fronhofer led the team on
this event with a score of
9.7.

Floor exercise, normal-
ly the team’s best event, fell
just shy of the vault, as the

score, ﬁnished with a 47.85.

Rules changed to combat deadly wrestler weight-loss workouts

Brlan Knavish

Staff Wrlter

Rob Loper lost eight and a half pounds
in under two hours by riding a stationary
bike in a steam—ﬁlled shower roon1. Chad
Jesko lost 16 pounds in one day by contin-
ually exercising in a plastic suit. Larry
Sprecher starved his body and worked out
threetimesadaytocutdownfromanatur-
al weight of 175 pounds down to 142.

The practice of weight-cutting is a nec-
essary but dangerous part of wrestling.

. Necessary because a grappler wants to drop
‘ to a ﬁghter weight class to avoid the disad-

vantage of facing a stronger opponent.
Dangerous because severe dehydration can
be life threatening, as proven when three
NCAA wrestlers died while cutting weight
this season.

“We’re pretty much willing to do what

V it takes to lose the weight, but unfortunately
* some guys take it too far,” Jesko, a junior on

the Pitt wrestling team, said. “No one
makes us do it, we do it on our own because
we want to lose the weight [because of the
competitive advantage it brings].”

The idea is that a wrestler who natural-

The “wrong way” is to eat anything

ly weighs 165 pounds will drop to 150 and desired, then embark on a crash diet, and
have a strength advantage at the lighter through treacherous exercise, force intense

weight class.

It becomes quite neces- 
sary because if he stays at 165, 
he wouldn’t actually wrestle
other 165-pounders, but much
stronger 180-pounders who
cut weight to drop down a
class.

The common criticism of
this practice is simple: If
everyone stays at their natural
weight classes, then the same
people will end up wrestling
anyway. It’s a waste of time to
cut weight. _

The problem is just as »
simple to ﬁgure out: One grappler will try to
beat the system and lose ﬁve pounds to drop
a class, sparking a chain reaction of other
wrestlers who want the same advantage.

There are two ways a wresﬂer goes
about losing weight. The “right way” is to
eat sensible, low-fat foods year—round while
maintaining a steady workout program

  

Part t of 2

sweating in the days prior to weigh-in.

“We want guys to work
out and do it the healthy way,”
Pitt Head ‘Coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “But guys
say, ‘Why should I train and
eat sensibly all year round,
when I can take the easy way
out and cut cheap weight the
week before the match?’ ‘

“It’s like studying for an
exam You know it’s better and
the effects last longer if you
study a little bit at a time, but
it’s easier to cram a few nights
. before the test.”

According to Eric Aboocl, head athlet-
ics trainer for the Pitt wrestling team, cut-
ting weight the “right way” is healthy, but
the wrong way is dangerous because “meta-
bolic breakdown occurs. The body is
severely dehydrated and can only keep up
for so long.”

In recent years, the NCAA gradually

"—--m~ .....-n—

 

changed its weigh-in rules which actually
seem to encourage the “wrong way” until
the last year’s deaths caused a dramatic
swing back toward older regulations.

The deaths — a freshman at Campbell
University who died of cardiac arrest, a
senior at the University of VV1sconsin—
LaCrosse who died of heat stroke, and a
junior at Michigan who died of kidney fail-
ure — were all caused by extreme dehydra-
tion, increased body temperatures and
overexertion.

Until earlier this season, wrestlers were
permitted to wear tight—ﬁtting plastic suits
that make them sweat more but are danger-
ous because of the high body temperatures
they cause. Athletes were permitted to work
out in saunas and steam rooms.

Traditionally, weigh-ins were just
before match time. But a few years back,
the NCAA bumped the weigh-in time back
to 24 hours prior to the match and eventual-
ly 72 hours.

That meant that a wrestler who had a
match on Saturday could make weight on

WEIGHT

Wednesday. This huge window
between weigh-‘ins and match
time enticed many wrestlers to
drop to an even lower weight
class. ,

Under this 72-hour method, a
grappler could afford to be utterly
dehydrated and too weak to wres-
tle when he made weight because
he had three days to recover and
put much of the weight back on by
the time he hit the mat.

Many experts consider this
dramatic bouncing up and down
of weight the most dangerous
aspect of weight—cutting. This

_ prompted the NCAA to change its

wei -in policy mid-year.
Plastics, saunas, and. steam

rooms are now forbidden. Weigh-

ins now occur two hours before

FROM PAGE 9

match time so wrestlers wouldn’t
have time to recover from an
extreme weight cut.

Because the rule changes
occurred rnid—year, everyone was
give a seven pound allowance (a
wrestler competing at 134 could
weigh as much as 141). .

But next year there will be no
allowance, which will many
wrestlers to move up at least one
weight class.

Most college wrestlers have
been cutting weight long enough
to know the limits of their bodies,
but there are those extreme cases
when the practice can be deadly.

Sprechers quest to lose one-sixth
of his body weight in one week.)

trademark dropcurve pitch, which makes bat contact
—ifany-—spiketheballintofoulterritory. LeViere
said she had the hardest time learning her change-up
pitch — a slow pitch that originates from a fast
windup to confound batters.

As she practiced with her father, Laura learned
enough to become an assistant coach on his traveling
team, the Pittsbmgh Spirit, which draws its member-
ship from the top female players in Pittsburgh. Rich
LeViere says his daughter has been “instrumental” in
helping to coach the Spirit, which he began four years
ago largely because there were no All-Star-type fast-
pitch teams in the city for his daughters to play on.

This experience, coupled with the assistant
coaching she does for Northgate High and instructing
the 200 to 300 yearly attendees of some of her father’s
softball clinics, has reinforced Laura’s own training.

“The reason I know why [girls I coach] are doing
it wrong is because I’ve done it wrong,” she said.

LeViere said she and her Pitt teammates have
conﬁdence in themselves and each other and she
thinks the team’s two semesters of practice are set to
pay off. Her teammates’ perfonnance in practice, she
said,hasshownthateachmemberisanintegralpart
of getting Pitt softball recognized and on the road to
national titles. '

At a recent practice, LeViere stood among a sea
of blue Pitt shorts and white Pitt athletic T-shirts the
team practices in, and focused intensely on the play-
ers rounding bases in a practice drill. Her short con-
versations with teammates waiting in a line that
wound to the home-plate starting point was occasion-
ally ptmctuated by a “C’mon!” or other shout of sup-
port to teammates on the ﬁeld.

“We’re really all on the same page,” I.eV1ere
said “Wealltriedoutandweal1madeit.”'I‘henshe
added, quite modestly, “No one really sticks out.”

It is a conﬁdence exhibited in both directions.

Junior Jessica Lytle, who plays ﬁrst base for Pitt, said
LeV1ere—theﬁrsttospringtoherfeetaﬁerabreak
and walk into line for a drill — “leads by example.”

“She’s kind of quiet but gets her point across that
way,” Lytle said “She’s the best pitcher that I’ve ever
seen  She’s got a good glove and a good arm.”

Pitt Assistant Coach Jen Wagner called I_eV1ere
‘Very much of a team player” and respects her ball-
placement ability on the mound.

“She understands the batter’s weaknesses,” said '

Wagner. “She’s pretty good at hitting her spots and
likes to challenge the batters.” '

Head Coach Michelle Phalen said that the 19-
year—old LeViere, junior Jen Mannick and junior
Shelby Scrabis have emerged as the team’s best pitch-
ers, noting that LeViere throws a “pretty nice change-
up and curveball.” Rounding up her arsenal, LeViere
sports a fastball that averages, 62 mph and has been
clocked at 64 mph.

Because Pitt’s ﬁrst series last weekend at Robert ’

Morris College was rained out, Phalen said she hasn’t
been able to see what the Pitt pitching staﬂ’ will do on
the ﬁeld. Phalen said she’s anxious to see the same
tenacity and dedication from LeViere and her 18
teammates that she’s seen in practice.

This Wednesday’s 5:30 p.m game against St.
Francis in Pitt Stadium will be the team’s, and
I.eVrere’s, ﬁrst chance to show this dedication.

Here at Pitt, I_.eV1ere is working hard with the

pitching staff and Phalen so she can lead the rookie I

team to a competitive ranking in the next two years.
LeViere says she feels that she’s still learning and that
Phalen is an excellent coach.

“I really want her to help rrte. She works well
with the bullpen,” I.eV1ere says. “I think she knows a
lot.”

Inside this star pitcher, there’s a woman who’s
still willing to watch and learn through the fence.
