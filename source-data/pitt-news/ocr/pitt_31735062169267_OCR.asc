SG Chooses Levitan,
Weingarten for Board;

Ed. Cabinet Approved

by PAUL STOLLER

Student Government (SG) picked two members of the impor-
tant three member University Review Board. Out Of the ﬁV€ P90-
ple nominated only David Levitan and Michael Weingarten were
elected by the necessary two-thirds vote of the SG Senate. Accord-
ing ‘to Ken Ferderick, SG president, the University Review Board
will serve the function of being an organizational disciplinary com-
mittee. “The Review Board will also serve as a judicial arm °f.SG:”

added Frederick. _

Because of the importance of
this body, the usual voting pro-
cedure was altered a bit. Each
of the ﬁve nominees was con-

sidered separately. “This,” stat- _

ed Frederick, “will enable us
to consider these people solely
on their merits.”

-Since the Senate had approved
only‘two members of the three
member Board, some Senators
wanted to ﬁll the committee.
Senator Vic Willem moved that
the Senate reconsider the de-
feated nominees. After a long
parliamentary hassle, the nom-
iness were reconsidered. The re-
consideration, however, was in
vain because none of the pre-
viously defeated nominees re-
ceived the necessary two-third
consent of the Senate.

The Senate also discussed a.
number of important bills. One
bill which‘ was passed ~unani-
mously ‘establishes a School of
Education Cabinet. In the tra-
dition of the Engineering and
Mines and Pharmacy Cabinets,‘
the new School of Education
Cabinet‘ will serve as a vital
communications link between
education students and their re-
spective administration‘.

The second bill which was
proposed by Mike Bryson called
for the establishment of Stu-
dent Union fund drive. Accord-

ing to Bryson, “The purpose of

the fund drive is to get enough
money so that a new Student
Union building could be built as
soon_as possible.” The bill stip-
ulated that the fund drive would
be initiated in the fall.

During the discussion- Ken
Frederick pointed out that a
fund drive of this nature would
conﬂict with other building fund
drives already scheduled for the
fall. After ~ a long debate, con-
corning the feasibility of such
a fund drive, the -bill was de-
feated.

Two campus organizations
were granted emergency alloca
tions from the Allocations Com-

mittee. Students for Peace re- ‘

ceived $335‘ for their proposed
Angry Arts program and other
budgetary expenses. The Wil-
liam Pitt Debate Union was
granted $250 to cover the ex-
penses of the National. Debate
Tolirnament and other addition-
al debate trips. All the allocw
tions were approved by the Sen-
ate.

The committee also presented
the Senate with some revised al-
locations procedures. One such
revision "is that all recognized
campus organizations must sub-
mit yearly budgets to the Allo-
cations Committee befroe the
new allocations were accepted
by the Senate. (Further details

Students Engage City Police I
During Three-Hour Escapade.

by BILL CABIN
(Furt/ze7' details on this story will
appear in Wednesday’s Pitt News)
"City of Pittsburgh police
have declared Pitt a riot zone.
The declaration came after
three false alarms brought
seven fire trucks, fifty po-
licemen, and police canines
to encounter nearly 2500 stu-
dents here last night. “We
are treating this as a riot
now and will be patrolling
around tomorrow (today). There

will be no leniency, no grace,”
said Superintendent‘ of_ Police

. James Slusser.

A crowd of 75 students loiter-
ing on the Forbes St. Towers
patio steadily swelled after ﬁre
trucks came at 9 ‘pm. Fire
equipment blocked traffic bring-
ing several’ police cars from the
Oakland station.

Students began jovially har-
rassing police gathering at the
Forbes St. steps. ‘Soon’ water
balloons and toilet paper fell

. profusely from men's and wom- .

en’s dorms. As police kept stu-
dents off the sidewalks, a wave

.of students migrated to Fifth

Ave. to block traffic in sit-down
fashion.

Police wagons blocked off
Fifth Ave. and Forbes Ave. be-
tween Bigelow Blvd. and Bou-
quet St. Students then led police
on a three-hour wild-goose chase
between Schenley Qudrangle,
Bigelow B_lv.d., Bruce_ Hall steps,
and the Towers patio. At the
height of the chase students
lined both sides of Forbes and
were periodically chased back
by police wielding billy-clubs and
canines. Students continually

Vietnam Discussion ‘

  Teach —

by IVAN ABRAMS

Friday night’s Teach-In on
Vietnam was “not a demon-
stration, nor a simple de-
nunciation of the govern-
ment, but much more. It was
an exchange of ideas and re-
actions to the greatest prob-
lem facing thenation today,”
stated Dr. Eugene McCreary,
the programs’ moderator.

Speaking first on “Viet-
nam: A Question of National
Interest,”. historian Dr. Jos-
eph Burke told the audience
of 1400 packing the Student
Union Ballroom that “the
war on the battlefield is
dwarfed by a struggle within
ourselves, between our princi-
ples, our practices, and our mis-

guided sense of what national
honor is.”

Following Dr. Burke was a‘

panel discussing the War and‘
American Foreign Policy.‘ fljhre
‘ﬁrst speaker, Dr. Jonathan 1H§r-

ris, decried the assumption tliat ‘

possibility of Soviet interven-
tion on the North Vietnamese
- side does exist.
Dr. Robert Singer, speaking
on “How Undeveloped Nations
View American Foreign Policy,”
said that many nations view the
United States as a world po-
liceman, ready to exercise its
vast power at the slightest hint
of anti-American sentiment.
Dr. Ray Richman, the next
speaker on the panel, said that
_“the United States is engaged in
a war for the dominance of a

narrow ideological group which I

directs the government policy
machine.” “
Richman said that “the war
is directed against the US na-
tional interest, against the poor
and the w0rkers——-their sons die
and they pay taxes to continue it.”
Dr. Thomas McCormick, chided,
“If you dig the Jefferson Air-
plan on love, you can't shoot
guns and kill people.” He con-
tinued to decry the empire alli-
ance system of the United States.
McCormick was followed by
Dr. Robert Newman who stated

that the cause for government

periors what they want to hear.

A panel on ‘Policy Alterna-
tives began after a short pause,
with Dr. Irving Shulman as the
ﬁrst speaker. He said that the
United States presence in Asia
is a threat to Chinese security
and for this reason they want
us to leave, but that China is
not considered, even by the Pres-
ident's advisors, to be expan-
sionary.

Dr. Richard Cottam, speaking
next, reviewed the civil nature
of the Vietnam conﬂict and re-
minded the audience that any
action of escalation by the US"
may have drastic repercussions.

The concluding speaker, Dr.
Robert Colodny, recalled the
words of Tacitus, “They have
made a desert and called it
peace.” “We call it not just
peace, but freedom, democracy,”
he decried to the assembly. “We
must realize,” he continued, “that
we are a violent people in need

and frightened by power. You

Kurtzman etter Issued it

For the past two nights, University students have been
celebrating what has come to be known as the academic rites
of spring. Last night, the affair ca-me close to being a tragedy.

The motivations are understandable. The academic year is
coming to an end. Final examinations are just a week away.
The pressure is mounting, and there’s a natural inclination to
let off steam. Under the year-’round calendar, there's no time
to make it to Fort Lauderdale, so it happened here. All well
and good, as long as no one gets hurt.

Last night, ‘a policeman (who, incidentally, was not har-
rassing, threatening or cajoling anyone, but simply standing
in the street in front of a crowd of students) was hit in the
forehead by a rock, knocked to the ground, and injured. A
student crossing the quadrangle under the Tower dorms had
his lip cut open by splattering glass thrown from the window
of an upper ﬂoor. The opportunities for disaster were even
greater. The tension of the civil authorities grew very near
to the breaking point. The whole situation came close to be-

ing much worse.

The superintendent of police has told us that he cannot
run such risks again. In any future instance, he will have to _
take early and serious action in a manner that would have
major, long-term consequences for those involved. Such .8. Sit-
uation would be beyond t-he University’s control and would
directly involve the student, his family, and civil authorities. V

The University may well have to consider its own dis-
ciplinary action. The University feels that student freedoms
extend not beyond the point where they endanger the" well- '
being of others. That point was exceeded on several occasions

last night.

The leaders of Student Government and student organi-
zations and I_, therefore, strongly and sincerely urge you not
to let such conditions arise again, and to discourage any who .
would foster them. We urge you, not simply for the good
name of the University, but for your own good name and _

safety.

_(with-Ken Frederick, president, Student Government;

j,‘ . , , Tom Meisner, vice-president; and

. New Legislation Threatens

by PAUL YEAGER

Confronted with the pend-
~ ing ratification of President
Johnson’s proposed “Fair”
revisions and the possibility
‘ of undergraduate deferments
= being’ Withdrawn, students
will soon face prospect of
having to abandon college to be-
come a soldier. A logical ques-
tion here is how can a‘ student,
A facing-the demands of the draft,
" ‘continue his college education
uninterrupted.
Such means as declaring him-
 self a conscientious objector or
defecting to Canada are possible
answers to this question. How-
ever, there is one solution that
‘ would perhaps be attractive to
the more conservative student.
_ It is found in the form of the
‘_.Army ROTC program.
, The University’s Army ROTC
sponsors a program that could
 provide a student up to nine
years of draft-free education.
_This includes four years of ‘un-
dergraduate work and a possi-.
“ble ﬁv_e years in graduate-school.
*_"’I_‘he, programs necessitates the
undergraduate student to par-
’ ticipate in four years of ROTC
, ‘training along with his regular
academic work.
' ’ At the end of his training and
to graduation from college, he is

  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
   
   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  

ant in the Army Reserve. He
now has the regular commit-
'\ ment _of two years active and
four years reserve duty to ful-
’ 7 ﬁll, but this can be defered if he
— desires to enter graduate. school
__ and until he earns his advanced
“ degree.

‘ The program is basically di-
vided into two phases. First, any
male United States citizen over
14 years old who is physically
ﬁt and enrolled as a full time

 Students responded with laugh-
ter and a chorus of “For He's a
Jolly Good Fellow.’_’ Kurtzman
retreated to the Towers lobby
under a scattered shower of wa-
ter Vballooons. There he prom-
ised students, “We realize it’s

commissioned a second lieuten-

ization of the Army and its func-
tions.
’ The second part of the pro-
gram is called the Advanced
Course and provides intensiﬁed
training, primarily in military
leadership. This is the selective
part of the program. Only those
students who have proper rec-
ommendations, acceptable QPAS,
and good scores on physical and
mental tests will be accepted.
A student can apply and be ac-
cepted for the four year pro-
gram and his draft deferment
as early as his freshman year.
He signs a “statement of intent”
that declares he will apply for
and enroll in the-Advanced
Course if accepted. At this time
-he automatically receives a 1D
deferment which places him out-

side the draft pool until he com- ‘

ples his undergraduate program
and if desired, his graduate
work. Students who are not _ac-
cepted into the Advance Course
will be placed back in the draft
pool.» >

If a student did not enter
ROTC as a freshman, he .is still
eligible for this program at the
end of his sophomore year. The
entrance requirements are the
same as the entering freshman.
However, he attends a six week
summer camp which, if success-
-fully completed, will enable him
to go into the,Advanced Course.

Men May Lose Deferments’

This six week ‘camp represents
the equivalent of the ﬁrst two
years of ROTC training.

There is a quota of students
that are allowed to take part_in
the Advanced Course. It is de-
termined by the Department of
Army in Washington. The quota
for each university or college is
determined by three basic fac-
tors: the quality of the school's
ROTC program in the past, qual-
ity of past ROTC graduates, and
the academic facilities of the
school. \ __

According to Colonel David
Clagett, newly assigned head of
the University’s Army ROTC,
our ROTC program is excep-
tional in all ‘these areas. From
this promising statement it can
be implied that in the future a
large number of students will
be accepted into the advanced

\training and, therefore, reecive
draft deferments.

The number of students in the
ROTC program has grown from
200 students in the fall of 1965
to 500 in the fall of 1966. Colonel
Clagett feels more students
should participate in -ROTC, for
it is their duty to develop their
leadership qualities. The pur-
pose of ROTC is to “determine
who the leaders are and give
‘them background in the mili-
tary,” according to Colonel Clag-
ett.

Opinions About Draft

Recently a poll was taken of

a group of freshmen and sopho-

mores on the draft and its alter-
natives. The students were ask-
ed whether in the absence of
draft deferments they would
rather be in an ROTC program
a.nd receive an uninterrupted
college education or devote their
entire time to academic work
and take a chance with the lot-
tery system.

The latter choice requires stu-
dents to participate in two tri-
mesters of the University’s phy-
sical education program which
is taken instead of ROTC train-
ing.

One comment by freshman
John Lang expresses the opinion
felt by all: “I would rather be
in the athletic program, because
I feel it is more worthwhile.”
Even ROTC cadets interviewed
expressed doubt of the effective-
ness of the ROTC trainings, es-
pecially the ﬁrst two years.

At present, it seems most stu-
dents have little desire to take
part in ROTC. However, as they
feel the clutching hands of Un-
cle Sam, they will probably re-
consider the ROTC program, for
it will be one of the few ways
to receive an uninterrupted col-
lege education.

  The Apathetic Syndrome

 
 

question whether or not this adage can be applied to the communications
problemat our University. Out of an undergraduate population of several
thousand, Thursday’s Student Government (SG) Forum on Student Involve-

S ment in\Decision-Making boasted the following attendance figures: four

panel members, eleven SG senators; eight University administrators; and
fifteen members of the student body. The above figures register the maxi-
andout during its course. ' -
We can find three reasons to explain this shameful turnout: students
simple do not care; students are satisfied; or students feel that their par-
ticipation would be useless, since little would result from any outcome.
Disregarding the excuse that students are satisfied, we must lay

1‘ some of the blame on the apathy that perennially pervades the walls of
5 this University. Should we be satisfied with the highlight of the year in

terms of student involvement: 3,000 voters in the SG election?

We know some students care, since the Pitt News receives a steady
stream of letters from dissatisfied students, who often propose construc-
' tive' alternatives, and we must conclude that there is a concerned element

 in our student body. Witnessing the activity of our political activist-

groups, for example, we commend their drive but lament that students are

' directing their energies almost solely toward political issues and bypassing

an area where theyare desperately needed—student affairs.
A. list of the officers of our campus organizations. reveals unnecessary

“duplication of students in leadership positions due to this lack of student

involvement. These students are not always the most capable; they are

1 ' often the most ambitious. This explains why they often accept the status

quo in the area of ‘student affairs, with all of its limitations. They acknow-
ledge that they can only achieve so much and are frequently powerless to

Hope may spring eternal in some cases, but we have to seriously.

mum total of attendance during the one-hour forum, as people wandered in

   

act, but they do receive recognition and status for their participation.
These “leaders” often establisha rapport with various administrators and
are incorporated into the administration by virtue of their submission to
these officials. They do not represent our student body! Their thinking is
much more akin to that of an administrator’s.

Students who do advocate measures to improve our current state of
affairs will often vo_calize our needs effectively but are not geared towards
constructively contributing by actually participating in key student ac-
tivities for a lengthy period of time. They appear on the scene during
election time and ably point the finger at many poorly-handled areas. After
Election Day, however, the victors occupied with administrative duties,
and the defeated candidates retreat into an 11-month period of hibernation
until the next SG campaign. . r

The lack of student leadership is lamentable, but it does not fully ex-
plain the belief of the segment of -our student body who feels that attend-
ing a forum on student involvement in decision-making is a waste of time,
since little would result from any such discussion. Students have been ex-
cluded from decisions to the point that we cannot even criticize them for not
acting——they’ve never had the chance. We’re paid lip service in most in-
stances, but We rarely play an active part in actions involving our student
body. _ . .
We recognize that student leaders have only limited powers, but we

stress that these leaders are rendered completely ineffective if opportunities _

such as the SG Forum, where our Chancellor appeared on the panel, reveal
that so few students care. The rows of empty chairs were blatant and dis-
gusting apathy and proof of the utter alienation of the majority of students
at our University. Regardless of previous experiences, students must now
show that they are concerned. Otherwise, the future will bring more of the
token respect for our opinions that has marked the past.

Incidentally,. there is a clear
indication that the police officers

First ‘You’re-In’
Planned for Quad

Editor, The Pitt News:

’ Two weeks ago they had a Be-
In in New'York. Just this past
weekend we had a Teach-In here
at Pitt. Everywhere one reads
about Sit-Ins, Talk-Ins, Walk-
Ins, etc. Never before, however,
has there been a “You’re-In.”

A You’re-In is a time when
graduating seniors get together

to congratulate each other on i

being accepted to graduate
school. Amidst an,_ atmosphere
of festivities and joy they greet
each other and acclaim, “You’re-
In! H” (Of course, they are care-
ful not to slur the R's when
saying this.)

-Naturally, a You’re-In is not
complete unless all students
come to add their sympathetic
and congratulatory comments to
the occassion. Therefore, every
student is urged to attend the
First Annual You're-In for the
Graduating Class of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. The You’re-
In will begin at 4:00 this Fri-
clay and will be held in the Quad-
rangle. Remember to be there
and bring your friends. Let’s
make this the biggest You’re-In
that Pittsburgh has ever seen.

By ‘Door’ Secret S

Editor, The Pitt News:

“The ‘secret’
Door.”

On the evening of Wednesday,
March 8, I attended Greek Sing
at the Carnegie Music Hall. I
found the presentations of most
of the fraternities and soror-
ities most enjoyable until num-
ber 20 appeared on the show.
Number 20 was Kappa Sigma
Fraternity’s rendition of “Green
Door.” I found the roaring 20
style gangster costumes rather
amusing, but what I did not ﬁnd
very amusing was what was
behind the “Green Door.” The
"secret” of the “Green Door” I
found to be derogatory and
passe. The “secret” of the “Green
Door,” a white man with‘ his
face and "hands painted black
doing what is commonly known
among Negroes as the “ham-
bone” — a rhythmic thigh slap-
ping routine, belongs in the Al

Jolson era. This .“secret” had no

place in the Greek Sing of March
8 or any other Greek Sing any-
where in this nation at any
time. One could probably ex-
pect this to happen at Ole Miss,
but here at the “liberal” Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, I ﬁnd this

,most intolerable. It is my feel-

ing that the brothers of Kappa
Sigma fraternity should have
kept their “secret” of the “Green

- Door” — a secret.

Girls’ Comments
On Draft Scored

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am quite amazed that the
women of the University are
taking such an active interest
in the draft situation. Women
in this modern age seemingly
don't feel their duties are ex-
clusively home directed. Many
men aren’t sure whyiwomen are
taking such an interest. Should
_we be overjoyed that women
are sacriﬁcing their time and en-
ergy to ﬁnd the best solution
to the draft problem, or is it
another movement in sex equal-
ity‘? If the former is true, we
are thankful, however, should
the latter be the truth, why
hasn’t a movement been start-
ed to include the women in the
draft? ,

Tennis Team Expects ;l‘ough VYVU Opener
  ptimisticMitters Open Against St. Francis

'1‘-he tennis team traveled
to West Virginia today to
start another season which
again appears destined to go
unnoticed and unsupported
by the student body. A,win-
ning season could help things a

little, but it will take a lot of
hard work and a lot of luck.

Coach Ben Pope's starting
lineup was ﬁnally decided yes-
terday when Robert Kellman, a
junior from New Rochel1e,gN.Y.,
was named sixth man. Earlier,
the coach :had decided on his
ﬁrst ﬁve.

Bill Nichols, a junior from
Edgewood, is again in the team's
number one spot. Bob Salem-
bier, another junior and num-
ber two man, now appears to
be in close competition for the
top spot. Selembier is a trans-
fer student from the Bradford
regional campus. Bill Goldstein,
a junior from Atlanta, Ga., is
the third man.

(‘The top three players are,

outstanding,” Pope says.

The fourth and ﬁfth men,"

Erik Lieberman and Marty Lie-
bowitz, respectively, are senior
returnees from last year's team.
Lieberman is a local boy and’
Liebowitz is from Brooklyn, N.Y.

The reserve, number seven,
position is still up for grabs.
Pope will probably keep Elliot
Sainer, a junior from Teaneck,
N. Y., but James Auerbach has
been giving him competition for
the spot.

The team hadn't practiced out
doors until Saturday. They then
used the new clay courts behind
Trees Hall. Home games cannot
be played there, however, be-
cause the state prohibits play
until a paved road to the courts
is constructed. Presently, a bum-
py dirt road leads to the courts.

Coach Pope expects a tough
match against West Virginia.
The Mountaineers have not been
scouted so Pope doesn’t know
the calibre of his opponent. 6

“West Virginia has always had
real tough teams,” recalls the
coach. “They’re topnotch every
years.”

Pope counts on a better bal-
anced team and hopes for a few
breaks. Last year, the Pitt ten-
nis team ﬁnished with a miser-
able 3-11 record, but “we lost a
tough 6-3 game and three match-
es by one point, and those could

’ have gone either way,” pointed

out Pope.

Pitt’s second match, against
Bucknell, is at home April 8.

Hart Needs Quarterback Key

To Unlock

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor

Before the Panthers face
another Fall season with the
likes of Notre Dame and
UCLA popping up, head
coach Dave Hart needs a
quarterback.

It might be said he has every-
thing else, after watching Satur-
day’s scrimmage; But presently,
Hart is in a bind. He has depth
at this key position, but not one
standout.

“Our quarterbacks are run-
ning hot and cold, how do you
say it, sporadically,” related
Hart.

On the Panther depth chart,
candidates are battling for the
starting berth. Bob Bazylak, a
5-11, 178 pound McKeesport, Pa.,
senior is listed number one, but
the chances are even for every-
one.

The other challengersare
sophomores. Frank Gustine, at
6-1, 190, from Pittsburgh's Cane-
vin High, was described as “hav-
ing the best shot at quarter-
back,” by Hart after the 1966
season. The number three and
four signal callers, both from
the Buckeye state, are Jeff Barr,

Face West Virginia Today

Collegiate golf is a rough sport on spectators, and it’s

Newcomer Rick Golden came
the closest to victory, losing to
Middie Bob Cuccious on the ﬁn-
al hole of competition. Golden,
a transfer from the Bradford
regional campus and in his ﬁrst
year of competition, shot the
varsity’s lowest round of the
day—an 84 which actually tied
Cucciuos in strokes. The varsi-
ty_’s other six golfers didn’t fare
nearly as well.

_ a good thing there weren’t many around to watch the golf-
, ers open their season at Annapolis Saturday. Navy’s squad
iblanked the varsity duffers, 7-0.

Dick Winter lost 6 and 5; Karl
Quinn was edged 5-4; John Del-
laverson fell 3 and 2; Bill Bry-
on was topped 8 and 7; Terry
David was downed 4 and 3;
Golden, of course, lost 1-up; and
John Mandell was beaten 4 and 2.

The golf squad only has to
win four matches this year to
better last season. They travel
to West Virginia today.

a 6-1, 190 Canton product, and
Chuck Winters, a six foot, 196
pounder from East Liverpool.

“Baz is running ﬁrst string
now. No one else is looking bet-
ter,” explained Hart. “But all of
them sure have improved since
we began spring practice three
weeks ago.”

Poor weather conditions, in the
first two weeks of drills,.hamp-
ered the quaterbacks. “This is
one position where the weather
really hurts you. There were
days when it was so cold they
couldn't grab the football," noted
Hart.

“And a quarterback must work,
work, work at it (his timing).
More than anything, this weath-
er killed us,” he said.

But for the most part, the
Panthers’ second spring practice
under Hart is greatly improved
over, last year. It not only shows
in the number of players, 68 to
59 of last year, but it is evident
in thequality of play.

“All of our lineman are block-
ing, and now we have guys who
want to run,” pointed out Hart.

Hart feels that are at least 11

sophomores who have done a
ﬁne job to date. Listed as ﬁrst
stringers, on the offensive in-

6-4, 205 pounds at tackle; War-
ren Allen, 6-1, 190 at guard; and
Dave Magyar, 6-3, 218 at center,
all have warranted praise from
the staff.

And those guys who “want to
run” are tailback Denny Ferris,
a six foot, 195 soph from North
Catholic, and wingback Joe Mc-
Cain, another soph at 5-11, 190.
Ferris is listed ahead of letter-
man Joe Jones, who also will

Despite poor field condi-
tion, the baseball team tries
to get off on the right foot
tomorrow when they open
the season against St. Fran-
cis at Leech Farm Field at
2 :00 p.m.

Because of the poor weather
for the past month, Leech Farm
!has been in pretty bad shape,
according to ‘baseball coach Bob-
by Lewis. “I talked to them last
week and they said that the out-
ﬁeld was so soggy they couldn’t_
even get on it.”

But, the dry weather over the
past few days has given the-
ground crew a chance to’ work,
and Lewis now believes the ﬁeld
will be ready “if there’s no rain
between now and Tuesday.”

, The dry weather has also giv-
en Lewis his ﬁrst opportunity
to see the players perform out-

side. Until the past week they
had been operating out of the
limiting conﬁnes of the -Field
House.

After four intrasquad games
over the weekend, Lewis ﬁnally
settled on a tentative starting
lineup, and it is composed main-
ly of familiar faces in unfami-
liar positions.

Opening at ﬁrst base will be
Tom Smith. Used mostly as a
pinch ‘hitter last year, Smith won
the ﬁrst-sackers job with his hot
bat in the squad games. “He hit
a couple of long balls and we
need that,” . explained Lewis.

Smith's arrival in the lineup
has moved last year's ﬁrst base-
man, Christ Mitchell, to catch-
er. “He looks good catching,”
Lewis noted. “He has a strong
arm and he’s been handilng the
pitchers real well. He hasn't
been hitting‘, but I think he's
been pressing.” Mitchell batted
.300 last year.

Another newcomer, Ken
Cooke, has moved Steve Kienzl
from the shortstop spot he held
for two years, and forced him
to take up new residence at sec-
ond. “Steve’s looking real well
there,” explained Lewis. “He
makes the pivot real well. He
has a strong arm and can snap
the ball on the dou|bleplay.”

The only inﬁelder returning
to the same spot as last year is
third baseman and team cap-
tain Tom Beckett. Last year,
Beckett batted .246, but “his hit-
ting is picking up now," accord-
ing to Lewis.

The outﬁeld is the one place
where the lineup is not ﬁrmly
set. Lefty George McKenzie is
ready to open in center and an-

other southpaw, Tom Stickel,
will be in right. But the left-
ﬁelder will either be rightand
hitter Phil Nasrallah or switch-
hitter Warren Sordill depending
on the Frankies pitcher.

If they open with a lefty on
the mound, Nasrallah will get
the call; if it’s a righty, then
Sordill will start.

The mound chores for the mit-
ters will be divided between sen-
ior righthander Don Stock and
junior southpaw Dave Welty. “I
think it’s too early to test one
of them all the way,” Lewis ex-
plained.

Welty will open and hurl the

front ﬁve, then Stock will take-
over and pitch the ﬁnal four.

Torpedo Thinclads

by ART ROSENGARTEN
Coach Jim Banner’s thinclads opened the spring track
season just as they closed the Winter season, in defeat. They
lost at_Navy, 131-23 Saturday, but the statistics do n-ot tell

the whole story. .-

Banner thought “the margin “

of victory would have been even
bigger, as Navy is an extreme-
ly well-balanced team, being
three deep in almost every posi-
tion.” Navy has a squad of 70
men, compared to the tracksters’
17.

With only three days of prac-
tice outdoors, Banner was pleas-
ed with the transition made by
the runners from the wooden
boards to the cinder track. He
felt that the good‘ conditioning
of the boys helped in this transi-
tion.

Junior Wayne Bodenheimer
had the team’s only ﬁrst place,
that in the javelin. He had three
throws over 190 feet, including
his winning toss of 208 feet.
Coach Banner attributed these
“real good throws” to the excel-

7 (lent physical condition Wayne

kept himself in all winter.

Frank Handleman ran the
fastest time in his career, 1:55,

but placed third in the half mile: ‘’

Chet Woj ciechowski and Mark
Pollack each placed in two events.
Wojciechowski took second in
the 220 yard dash and third in
the 100 yard dash. Pollack took
thirds in the discus and the shot
put.

Two runners, sophomore King-
man Davis and junior Jack Ney-
er, who Banner expects big
things from this season missed
the meet due to  Their
absence was felt, especially in
the 440 and mile relays.

SPRING GAME

The football team will hold
its annual Blue-White intra-
squad game this Saturday,

‘ practices, will start at 2 p.m.
Admission Will be by-JD

the general public.

when You Mu_s_t Keen Alert

When you can't afford to be drowsy,
inattentive, or anything less than all
there. . .here's how to stay on top.
VERV Continuous Action Alertness
Capsules deliver the awakeness of
two cups of coffee, stretched out
up to six hours. Safe
and non-habit-forming.

Both of these relays were ex-
tremely close, with Navy ahead
at the tape. In the mile relay,
Roger Holly ran a 49.2 seconds
quarter-mile, in which he chop-
ped 12 yards from the 15 yard
lead which the Navy man held
in the race. Navy's margin of
victory was one-tenth of a sec-
ond.

Considering this was the ﬁrst
meet, Banner feels the team will
improve as it gets more practice
on the outdoor track. The next
three meets are relays, and he
feels the team should ‘make a
better showing.

‘We have the type of team-
which will do better in the relay
meets, as the size of the squad
is not a major factor in determ-
ining the outcome.” In the dual
meets, the trackmen lose 18
points at the start, as there are
no athletes who compete in the
pole vault or javelin event.

"The Bowling Green Relays are
next on tap for the depthless
track team.

 

Hart Recruits
New York’ 3
9.7 Sprinter

Dave Hart recruited his 27th
player for the 1967 fresh-man
football team. He is Mike Con-
nell, out of Portville Central
High and he is a fast one.

Presently, he holds the west-
ern New York state 100 yard
dash record of 9.7 and last year
he was voted outstanding track-
man in that area.

He lettered four years each on
the track and football teams. As
a halfback last season, he gained.
970 yards, averaging six yards
a carry and caught 12 touch-
down passes. As a quarterback,

-he completed 24 of 36 passes
"for 312 yards.

‘‘There’s no substitution‘ for

great speed,” Hart related. “We I

can use him at ﬂanker or split
end because he is a ﬁne re-
ceiver or even at quarterback.”

Four or ' ﬁve more ‘recruits
will be announced at the Spring
game.

UPT Presents ‘
H. Pinter’s    
“Caretaker”

The University of Pittsburgh
Theatre will present Harold Pint-
er’s The Caretaker Friday at
7:30 p.m. and Saturday at 2:30

ﬁrst produced in .London and
New York, it rivaled the suc-
cess of his current offering, The
Homecoming. The Caretaker is
at once funny and disturbing,
arresting and haunting. Seem-
ingly ordinary events and peo-
ple are charged with subtle over-
tones and meaning. Out of situa-
tions that border on the grotes-
que and the ridiculous, Pinter
carefully pierces his characters’
protective facades and reveals
men steeped in loneliness, des-
pair, and terror.

An old tramp, Davies, is offer-
ed shelter in a cluttered room
of an abandoned house occupied
by two strange brothers, Aston

 L . and Mick. The old man over-

stays his welcome and the ten-
sion’ reachers frightening ’ pro-
portions as a curious struggle
for power ‘begins ‘between the
three characters.

Jeffrey Embler appears as-
Davies, Dan Nalbach as Aston,

V and Hamish ‘Patrick as Mick.

The production is directed by
John Krich and is part of the
University Theatre's Friday
Night Repertory Series. Tickets

I ' are on salelfor 75 cents at 1117
