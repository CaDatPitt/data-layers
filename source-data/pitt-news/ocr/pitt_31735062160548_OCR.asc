Cure or Parking Sought

By NATHAN MARYN

The University is deﬁnitely planning to provide parking‘

spaces for student use in the near future.

This revelation was announced by Dr. Charles H. Peake,
assistant chancellor for student affairs, Dr. Peake said that
the parking problem affects the University deeply.

“It is a problemlthat deepiyo

concerns us,in every way,” he
said. “Situations, however, must
be taken care of as they occur
while long range plans are taking
ﬁnape and being put into effect.
“Parking is a problem which
concerns the University in all
of its planning and the only
cure is special consideration for
the problem as a whole.”

He added that the University,
therefore, has the problem in all
of its thinking. Long range plans,
which’ cannot be definitely an-
nounced now, include considerable
reserve space,’ which would be for
the sole use of the University.

Attempts To Limit Parking,

In the meantime the University
must cope with current. problems
as they occur. Attempts have been
made by. both the City and the
Oakland businessmen to limit
parking in the area.

In each successive attempt the
University has voiced its ofﬁcial
opinion through the proper
channels. However, many of its
protests have not been heard
when they reached the City oili-
cials in charge.

In some cases the University has
been successful in maintaining the
“on-street status quo.” ‘Dr. Peak.
said that the University will con-
tinue to make itself heard in these
matters until it-is able to provide
its own parking for the Univer-
sity family. , N

Land”‘Price High
The problem; which is currently

  

facing the Universitycis the “sky

high” price of land in the Oak-
land area. More important, how-
ever,‘ is the fact that the proper
locations on the perifery of the
campus are “just not available
now.” 1

Addresses

" Omicron D elta Kappa’s
Gamma Circle held its forty-
first anniversary b a n q u e t
Monday evening in the Stu-
dent Union Supper Room. '
The feature speaker for the
banquet was the local chapter’s
newest honorary initiate, Dr. Ed-
ward H. Litchﬁeld. ODK is the
ﬁrst undergraduate fraternity to
add the Chancellor to its ranks.
Another outstanding innova-
tion was the use of the Chapel
for the initiation ceremony. Dr.
Donald E. Swarts, played selec-
tions on the organ during the
‘ entire ceremony.
 Dr. George W. Crouch, chair-
man of the English. department,
was toastmaster and introduced a
dozen prominent ODK alumni be-

“A new value for learning,”
said Chancellor Litchﬁeld, “is
the most demanding need to arise
out of the recent Sputnik launch-
ing by the Russians. The learned

of respect and reverence’ in his
community.”

Americans must be “prepar-
ed to make the ﬁnancial sacri-
ﬁce” to correct our “disorganiz-
ed educational system.” Fur-
thermore, We should seek -to
p r e v e n t “one—sided people”
from emerging from our uni-
versities and “allow women to
realize their full potential.”

This responsibility falls ‘not
only on loursecondary schools,
colleges, and universities, accord-

struction.” .
At the same time we must al-
low a degree of independence
.for the student to delve into
many areas, eliminating any
possibility of the “regimented
mind,” a condition which cov-
ers the entire Russian educa-
tional picture. V
In addition to Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld, four associate members and
nine undergraduate » m e In b e r s
were initiated into ODK.

LOVE IN THE LAUINDIRY

Last month we got the follow-
ing letter:
Dear Van H eusen, you rats:
p ’ Thanks mucho for breaking up
the hottest romance since Scarlet
and Rhett. Me and Laundry
Mark :c1,28Fy might be honey-
mooning in Palm Beach today
if it wasn't for your so-called
smart ideas. G0 shoot yourselves
in your ulcers. Respectfully
yours, Dorothea J omes.
We tgacked down the story
' behind 1t and found that Miss
J omes worked a steam-iron at
the Acme Laundry in Eastpox,
N. J. Last year, while ironing
a shirt belonging to Laundry
Mark x428Fy,.she had noticed
a small piece of paper pro-
truding from the slot on the
collar. Curious, "she pulled it
out and read: “Whoever you
are, I love the way you press

 my shirts. I think I may love

you too. ‘ Interested?” She
blushed, but daringly wrote
her answer — “Interested,
sorta,” and slipped it in the
collar-slot. Ten days later came
another shirt from x428Fy
and, sure enough, another
note: “If you can cook like you

can write I may be smitten
beyond recall. Fascinated?"
This time she almost swooned,
and wrote back, “Wow, am I!”
Anyhow, note followed hot
note and Miss Jomes began .
thinking of turning in her
steam iron for a marriage man-
ual. Until one day‘ tragedy
struck. x428Fy’s shirts arrived
as usual, but when Miss J omes
turned to the slot she found
it sewn-up. Frantic, she tried
to rip it open. No luck. She
could feel something thin in-
side, but she’ couldn't get to
it. And that’s how it’s been
ever since! ,_

You see, x428Fy had sw»'tch-
ed to slotless Van He en .
Collarite _shirts—-with sewn-in
stays! You should, too! These
micro-thin stays can’t get lost,
keep your collar flat, and
launder with your shirt! Spec-
ify Collarite next time.

And don’t feel bad about
Miss Jomes. She took her un-'
happiness out in hard work
and was promoted to assistant
manager. We expect a thank-
you note from her any day

industrialists, educators—-one hundred leaders who studied
at Pitt or who are working for Pitt sat on the edges of their

‘ his most signiﬁcant speeches. . '
They were members of ODK who heard his words‘. And

‘ But he was a man who had assumed leadership and who
was speaking before students and his peers who also had
assumed leadership in civic affairs. He was a man with a
message. They were listening. ~~

He warmed up to his message, considering the contem-
porary problem of ﬁrst—rate interest, and he contrasted
basic difference of the Russian and American education sys-
tems giving to each its merits. - i ~

developed into a speech of primary signiﬁcance. A man who

A Pied Piper     ‘  a

.3 ‘By Gordon Clowney
The results of recent polls of teen-agers seem
to be causing some concern to

throughout the country.

It seems these polls are bringing to light the
fact thatpmany teen-agers are holding the unions
‘responsible for the friction between labor and

management.

Mr. T. C. Carroll, president of
the Brotherhood of Maintenance
of Way Employees, declaresthat
“the youth of today is highly, in
favor of the ideals and princi-
ples of labor, but critical of some
of itspractices.” , ‘

Critical the man says, and why
shouldn’t they be if other unions
throughoutthe country are act-
ing as xinconsiderately toward
their companies. and the public

our standard of living to its present high. How-
ever, along with the good sometimes comes the

bad.

The following quote is taken from a letter writ-
ten toone of the downtown papers by a man who
was a trolley operator around the turn of the cen-

tury. ~

‘ “We were treated like slaves until we organized.
The extra men receizved 18 cents an hour, the reg-
ular men 22 cents—l'2i hours a day, seven days a
week . . . But the pendulum has swung the other
way. Organized power is dangerous to the public.”

This is the opinion of a man whose job was’
made better because he belonged to a union. "It
seems teen-agers aren’t the only ones aware of the
fact that unions, in. spite of their recognized good, .,

can become too powerful.

In their current strike ‘against the Pittsburgh

one of the striking operators. “They have the facts

you sit in on their meetings.”

money already, but those slick talkin’ guys con-
vinced me we are going to make all kinds of money
once this thing is settled.)
Teitel Surprised .

Gilbert Teitel, business representative K of the
union, in commenting on the membership’s over-
whelming rejection of the last company offer stated,
“We never e‘xpec_t,ed such conﬁdence.” . .

“The members showed their true feelings" and
it was areal surprise.” (Wow! I know we were
doing somefast talking before the vote but we
Imagine those guys turning down a good offer

Mr. Teitel again, this time commenting on the
counter—proposal the union has promised the com-
pany. “We feel we will come up with something-—
if and when another meeting is called by the
mediators.” -

“But we have been out seven weeks——another
day or, two won’t matter” (Those strikers don’t
look like they’re starving yet so we still have
plenty of time to make the company come to us.)

Union officials seem to think the term collective
bargaining means to wait until your opponent con-

An example of this share the wealth plan ad-
vocated by union leaders isthe statement made to
strikers that there is “six million dollars of com-

I pany money in the Chase National Bank, New

(Regardless of whether thisstatement is true or

appears to be guilty of violating
this principle. In assessing each

Saturday, the leaders have taken

With approximately« 800 fra-

Council is assured at least $1,200

Naturally; this cannot all be con-

The Interfraternity Council

will have only a small portion, if

; any, to give toward its

purpose for having the concert in

What all this discussion
amounts to is this: the Interfra-

absolved itself of the responsibil-

Letter to Editor

Editor, The Pitt News.‘-

This past year I transferred to
Pitt from Bucknell University.
Bucknell is a small school in
central Pennsylvania. Therefore,
it follows that a person from a
small school has small ideas.
People at Pitt have “big” ideas.

Upon entering Pitt, I became a
member of the University’s dra-
matic organization, formerly
called Pitt Players. Subsequent-
ly, I, became publicity manager
of this organization.

I found that Pitt is so “big”
that it permits one organization,

ers have their ﬁnal performance
of their current play, “Skin of
Our Teeth.” Unfortunately, we
will play tonan empty auditor-
ium.

Everybody will be at the jazz
concert sponsored by the I. F. C.
The show will lose money be-
cause of this.

One would think, that the peo-
ple in the administration oﬁice
would have enough regaigd for

its organizations not to permit this,
to happen. Or, perhaps, this is the
way they have of proving Pitt’s

sure the strikers that there’s plenty of money to

surveys have determined that the company is not‘

in a position to meet the demands of the union.
Instead of being satisﬁed with “a bird in the

hand,” the union seems determined to try for the

from each member, whether or‘

not there is any individual de-
sire to hear the concert.

There is nothing like ‘a. guaran-_‘

those who should be selling the
program to the students.
Interfraternity Council may
very well go ahead this week

now, however, there has been
very little indication that this

There is little question that the
“S” Award is a worthwhile pro-
gram. Perhaps the good inten-
tions of the Interfraternity Coun-
cil cannot be doubted either. But
the method they have chosen to

highly undesirable.

If an assessment is the instru-
ment for assuring success, it can
result only in alhollow success.

Former Diplomat
Takes Position As

Host To Foreigners
By DONNA CONSIDINE

His wide background in in-

ternational affairs has made
Colonel J. J. Sustar a natural
choice for the position of ad-
ministrative assistant to the
Cultural . Exchange Program
of the University of Pittsburgh.

Former soldier, diplomat, and
‘resistance leader in Czechoslo-
vakia during World War II, he
has interpreted and predicted
world events with emphasis on
the Cold War since his coming to
this country in 1948.

His role‘ in R the Cultural Ex-
change will be to host foreign
visitors to Pittsburgh when they
come under the auspices ofone of
the following groups: Department
of Health and Welfare; American
Council on Education; or the
Committee of Leaders and Spec-
ialists, a part of the Government-
al Affairs Institute of which
Chancellor Litchfield is chairman.

Select leaders in ﬁelds such as
education, industry, business, or
The Governmental Af-
fairs Institute sets up their pro-
gram and itinerary in the United
States. A six-to-eight week pro-
gram is average. a
The visitor has his choice of
locations. If he decides to visit
Pittsburgh,.Mr. Sustar sets up
a tentative schedule for him,
and they confer upon the vis-
itor’s arrival. ‘
The schedule is flexible. Ac-
cording to C01. Susta-r the visitor
has absolute freedom to see any-
thing he wishes. It is not a ques-
tion of our showing him what we
would like him to see. “Thus, he
can gather impressions from his
own experience,” th/e news an-
‘alyst added. »
Hopes To Fulfill Ideas
Col. Sustar applied for the
position because he felt _ that
through it he may fulfill some of
the ideas which he has promoted
in his speeches for a long time.
He said, “The exchange pro-
gram is one way we can teach
other peoples, and at the same
time, learn about them, for it is
only in knowing people and un-
derstanding the conditions in

\

which they live that we can
ever attain peace.”

He calls upon the whole Uni-
versity for support in making this
program succeed from the admini-
strators, faculty members, stu-
dents, and University employees.

Shows True Life

“I want to show visitors the
true American life in all ﬁelds be-
cause I know from personal ex-
perience that they have an un-
clear picture of what. American
people are like,'what they intend“
to do in the international picture,
and how they feel about world
leadership,” added Sustar.

His new appointment will not
interfere in his communication
activities. Col. Sustar writes a

syndicated column" for
VVorld Press Association.

He broadcasts over WCAE on
Sundays from 10 to 10:15 p.m. on
“Sustar Reporting” in an impar-
tial analysis of the news in which
he uses spot interviews with
foreign guests.

He telecasts two programs on
WQED. “World Headlines” is
heard Mondays and Fridays
from 6:45 to 7 p.m., and “Espe-
cially for You,” Tuesdays from
3 to 3:45 p.m. -

Col. Sustar spent 23 years in

the military and diplomatic serv-

ice in Czechoslovakia until 1939
when he helped organize under-
ground resistance there, in Pales-
tine, and in England.

WHAT TO Do‘ TILL "ma
PSYCHIATRIST COMES

Once upon a time at the University of Virginia there was
a coed named, oddly enough, Virginia University who was
handsome and kindly and intelligent and ingeniously con-
structed and majoring in psychology. Virginia went steady
with a young man on campus named, oddly enough,
Oddly lﬂnough who was supple and fair and lithe and ani-
mated and majoring in phys ed. ' »

Virginia and Oddly enjoyed a romance that was as
idyllic as a summer day, as placid as a millpond. Never
did they ﬁght-—never, never, never !-—because Virginia,
who was majoring in psychology, did not believe in ﬁght-
ing. “l<‘igl1ting,” she often said, “settles nothing. The sci-4
entiﬁc way is to look calmly for the cause of the friction.”

Soiwhenever she and Oddly were on the verge of a
quarrel, she used to whip out a series of ink blot tests and
they would discover the true underlying cause of their
dispute and deal with it in an enlightened, dispassionate
manner. Then, the irritant removed, their romance would
resume its tranquil, serene, unruftled Course.

After six montlps of this sedate liaison, Oddly was so
bored he could spit. He loved Virginia well enough, but
he also believed that people in love ought to tight now
and then. “It opens the pores,” he said. “And besides, it’s
so much fun making up afterwards.” .

But Virginia would not be provoked into a quarrel.
One night Oddly tried very hard. “Hey,” he said to her,
“your hair looks like a bat’s nest and your ears look like
last year's turnips and your face looks like a pan of worms

and as for your head, I’ve seen better heads on newel .

posts.” .

“My goodness, we’rc hostile tonight!” said Virginia
cheerfully and whipped l20 Horscliacli cards out of her
reticnlc. “Come,” she said, “let us examine your psychic
apparatus.”

  

 

43%.

Oddly tried again. “Who makes your clothes?” he
snecred. “Bethlehem Steel?” ,

“Hmm,” said Virginia thoughtfully and lit a cigarette
“This sounds like an anxiety neurosis with totemism,
anagogic trauma, and a beltlin the back.”

“I hate you,” said Oddly. “I hate your. looks and your
clothes and your toenails and your relatives and the
cigarettes you smoke.”

“Now, hold on, buster!” cried Virginia, her eyes crack-

‘ ling, her color mounting, her nostrils aﬂame. “Just keep a

civil tongue in your stupid head when you talk about
Marlboro! Nobody’s knocking that ﬁlter, that ﬂavor,
that ﬂip-top box While there’s breath in my body! It’s a
great cigarette, it’s a doozy, it’s a dilly, it’s a bear-—and
anybody who says a word against it gets this.”

By “this” Virginia meant a series of combinations to
the head and liver, which she now delivered to Oddly and
turned on her heel and stormed away. '

Oddly brought her down with a ﬂying tackle. “I love
you,” he said.

“And Marlboro?” said she.

“And Marlboro,” said he.

And they kissed and plaited love knots in one another’s
hair and were married at Whitsun and smoked happily

PanfhersiEnpd Season In Miami;
Gridders Need Victory V

For Successful Season

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

The Panthers and the Miami Hurricanes will bring the
regular college football season to a close on Saturday at the
Orange Bowl. The two one-time inter-sectional powers will
be striving, in the pleasant atmosphere of southern Florida,

to ﬁnish the season on a note of respectability with a win.
- The Jungle Cats are outvto bring their season’s record to

5-5 slate while the Miamians can?

‘improve their slate to 5-4-1, if
they triumph. The local football-
ers leave the chilly premises of
Pittsburgh on Thursday smorning
on a chartered plane. They will

\ practice in the Orange Bowlon

Friday morning.

Sa'turday’s: ﬁnale will begin at
4 p.m. (Pittsburgh and Miami
time), after the blistering heat of
the tropical day has subsided. An-

other reason for the late start is

to avoid conﬂict with the Steeler-

R Giant game which gets under way
" at Forbes Field at 1 p.m. on Sat-

urday afternoon.
Season Finale
“With a little bit of luck.” the

_ intrepid football ﬁend can catch

both contests: the pro game, in
person, and then the Panther tilt
on television.

The video boys have sched-
uled the Blue and Gold-IIurri-
cane clash as their last regular
season offering for the second
year in a row. In last ycar’s
battle the Panthers knocked the
Miamians from the unbeaten
(but tied) ranks with a solid 14-
7 victory. L

On the record books the Sky-
scrapermen have taken arms
against the Floridians four times.
They have split even by winning
and losing two. The wins have
come in alternate years and thus
the Panthers ﬁgure to lose this
one if the precedent continues. .

Injuries Healed

The oddsmakers, still pick the
Blue and Gold to win. Their con-
ﬁdence in the Panthers of 1957
is a result of the 14-13 win over
Penn State and the improved
physical condition of the fabled
“Injury Club” members. ‘

Even the oﬂ"icers of the or-
ganization, who are the most
seriously damaged individuals,

for the ﬁrst time since the Syra-

who became the Panthers’ most
dangerous runner at mid—season,
has recovered from multiple abra-
sions and sprains and should
prove a useful cinder in the

Cub-Johnstown
Opener Carded

The freshman basketball squad
begins; its sixteen-game schedule
tonight at the Field House with
Johnstown Center providing the
opposition. Game time is’set for

7:00 p.m. This contest will be a.

preliminary to the Varsity’s home
opener with Michigan. ,
Coach Carl Peterson will be

working with a hustling ball club
this evening. At center there’s 6’-

’ 5," John Fridley, the team’s tallest

member who has been the leading
rebounder on the freshmen squad
during practice sessions.

Paul Lazor, 6 -4", and How-
ard Lockhart, 6 -3", will start
at the forward berths. Lazor has
a wide variety of shots with the
hook being his best. Lockhart
shows great promise with his
improved ball‘-handling and
playimaking.

. Darwin Smith, 6'-2" w,i1l ﬁll
one of the guard positions- Smith
has shown 21 lot of skill as a ball-
handler and uses his weight well

‘ under the boards. The other guard

slot will be, ﬁlled by either Nick
Sutyak,‘ 67-3”, or Dick Falenski,
6'—2”. Both players have good
shooting ability, but Sutyak excels
on offense while Falenski shows
top defensive form.

Jim Foley, 6'-2", Pete Sudor,
6'-1", Bill Malarkey, 6’-21", and
Rick Bickel, 6’-2", will also see a
lot of action. Bickel, having been
out with an injured hand, has
been moving up with increasing
speed and hard drives under the
basket.

The talented Panther yearl-
ings have the drive and hustle
that will prove tough for their
opponents, including tonight’s
opposition. Johnstown Center
usually ﬂoors a good team and
this year is no exception.

The Westminster frosh have
been added to the schedule. They
will travel to the Field House this
Friday to compete with the
Panther Cubs in the game preced-
ing the appearance of the Pitt-
Furman tilt. Game time this Fri-
day will also be seven o’clock.

season ﬁnale between the Panthers and the Miami Hurri-.
canes this Saturday. '
As last year’s contest, this one will be flashed across the»
nation via television camera and will take place in the Orange

Bowl, home of the Hurricanes, iné
the ﬁrst week of December.

Butlright here is where any
comparison between the 1956
and 1957 games stops. Last year
at this time the Panthers had a
6-2-1 record and the Hurri-
canes’ chart read 8-0-1. The
respective records are now 4-5
and 4-4-1.

The Panthers won’t have a
chance to ruin Miami’s record as
they did last year when they
knocked the Hurricanes from the
ranks of the unbeaten, 14-7. The
Orange Bowl tenants have already
been ruined.

The ‘Hurricanes own victories
over Baylor, Kansas, Villanova,
and Florida State, and a scoreless
tie with North Carolina ‘State. But
Houston, North Carolina, Mary- *
land, and just last Saturday night,
Florida, have drubbed them. JOHN VARONE
