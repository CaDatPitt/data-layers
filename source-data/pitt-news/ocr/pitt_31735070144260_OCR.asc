ears shed, goodbyes said at S GB

Sembr Strzﬂ IV/‘ilcr

The 2008 Student Government
Board concluded its tenure with a
heartfelt session of reverence for
the accomplishments of its board

members.

Next year, seven new board
members, returning board mem-
ber Nila Devanath and president-
elect Kevin Morrison will change
power and take their seats on the

SGB, which controls the alloca-
tion of the $2.4 million student
activities fund. '

The board felt more inclined
to reveal its personalities and
friendships than in normal meet-

ings, and some members became
tearful.

Outgoing president Sumter
Link, who is graduating at the end
of the semester, said he looked
forward to hearing about the ac-

complishments of the new SGB.

“I have enjoyed serving as your
2008 Student Government Board
president, and I think this year’s
board will be successful,” said
Link.

PHILADELPHIA 4 Gov.
Ed Rendell presented a plan
yesterday that could affect stu-
dents by creating jobs domesti-
cally. I

The nation’s governors got
to work on Tuesday, taking
their case for a $136 billion in--
frastructure spending program
to the president—elect. The
governors hope the plan will
funnel _ immediate government
money toward bridges, roads
and rail lines in the hopes of
creating jobs and spurring the
economy out of recession.

It’s not a handout or a bail-
out, insisted the host of the
economic forum, Rendell, the
chairman of the National Gov-
ernors Association. Rather, it’s
the “best remedy for getting
America back to work,” he
said. ,

“We think that we can cre-
ate literally millions of new
jobs and at the same time lots
of orders for concrete and
steel companies and asphalt
companies and lurnber compa-
nies andthe likej’ said Rendell.
“None of the bailouts have

PPC hosts
gingerbread

house contest

by Alie Gensheimer
Staﬂ l»Vri[er

» Forty Pitt students faced
two major challenges last night:
The first was to create the most
visually appealing gingerbread
house in the room, and the
second, most trying task, was to
resist the temptation to devour
their edible works of art.

For the third consecutive
year, the Pitt Program
Council hosted the popular
holiday Gingerbread House
Competition in the \William
Pitt Union’s Kurtzman Room
as part of its Finals Survival
Week.

Unlike other years —- in
which students competed for
gift baskets —- this year, they
were fighting for $100, $50
and $25 Visa gift cards that the
Program Council awarded to
the top three winners.

"The event was so popular
that we had to turn people
away," said Sarah Ollio, director
of the contest and member of
the Pitt Program Council.

Though students knew the
task at hand was not going to
be easy, some were determined
not to lick even a finger until
they had constructed a winning
masterpiece.

“I’m going pro,” said Pitt

C sophomore Emily Coulter, who

modeled her structure to look

like Pittsb_urgh’s PPG Place.

created one new job. Infrastructure can
create, the economists say, 40,000 jobs for
every $1 billiongof infrastructure spend-

- ing. \Well, that’s a huge lift.”

At least 41 states are expected to face
budget shortfalls this year, in part because
the slowing economy has decreased tax
revenue that states depend on for their

annual spending plans.
Those shrinking state coffers come

even as hard times and layoffs force more _

people to apply for unemployment and
other state—administer,ed beneﬁts, includ-
ing Medicaid. And declining property tax
revenue in states with high foreclosure
rateshas hurt local governments, which
depend on that money to provide local
services. i

Obama on Tuesday pledged to move
as quickly as possible on a stimulus pack-
age_that could hasten an economic turn-
around, beginning at the state level.

“I recognize that every single one of
you is struggling to come up with a bud-
get at a time when you’re facing great and
growing needs,” said Obama, who asked
the governors for the meeting. “More and
more people are turning toyou for help
for health care, for affordable housing,
to prevent foreclosures’ even as the credit

- markets are tightening and tax revenues

are making it more difﬁcult to provide
that help.”

The cou‘ntry’s economic woes require a
bipartisan approach, Obama said. He told

the Republican governors at the meeting '

that he was offering “the same hand of

-other Republicans on board ~

friendship and cooperation that I offer our
Democratic governors. We havea strong
and vibrant democracy. We compete vig-

orously during an election. But with the A

end of that season comes the time to gov-

ern together — and that time is now.”
Most governors were on board with

the infrastructure spending proposal, in-

cluding high—prof1le Republicans such as _

Arnold Schwarzenegger of California. .

However, there was an undercurrent
of dissent, led by Republican Gov. Mark
Sanford of South Carolina. Sanford ar-
gued that it might not be possible to solve
an economic crisis created by running u_p

' too much debt by piling on more govern-
ment debt.

“There are very legitimate questions
by any number of different folks  on
whether or not this will indeed make the
difference,” said Sanford.

The ‘overriding sentiment among the
nation’s “top executives, however, was to
begin building, and as quickly as possible.

Rendell cautioned that all U.S gover-

nors are prepared to make sacrifices and

cut spending in other areas, and in many
cases they have already done so in the face
of slowing tax collections. Pennsylvania

has slashed $311 million from its budgets I

and will trim up to $500 million total in
the coming days, he said.

“Every governor in this room has dealt '

said.

the returning board member, gave an infor-
mal best board member award to Devanath
and a best committee chair award to aca-
demic affairs chair Jonathan Adams.

“Nila, you can be the mom now,” said
Ecker. “You have eight new babies.”

Link praised board members Amanda
Reed and Ryan Haddad for their work on
Pitt Make a Difference Day, when students
traveled to different parts of the city to vol-
unteer. -

“It was hands ‘down one of .. the best.

projects we did this year and that SGB has
done in past years,” said Link.

Board member Perry Servedio said his
job could be difficult.

“We were all kind of thrown into this
in January,” he said. “You’re going to break
some hearts along the way  it’s a thank-
less job. And in the end, you look back, and
it was worth it.” '

Some board members emphasized what
they admired in the members they disagreed
with. Devanath said she respected Haddad’s
outspokenness. ’

“I know we don’t see eye—to—'eye on
maybe everything, but that’s OK,”_said De-
vanath. “We need a diversity of opinions.”

Several board members said Francee
Varner served as the funniest and most sar-
castic board member. »

“I never have a report,” said Varner jok— ,

ingly. “Giving anyone the panthers would
discourage them.” i

Ecker told new members of the board
—— only Morrison and. incoming board
member Max Greenwald were present at
themeeting —— that their projects would not
be the mostimportant part of their job.

“What’s really important is that you
know what you standifor and what you be-
lieve in,” said Ecker. “Remember why you’re
there. It can be hard, because not everyone
is going to like it.”

Outgoing board member Gary Sander-
son said he believes ir1 Pitt.

“We all love Pitt, and we did this for the
betterment of the University,” he said.

Obama, Biden and T

Palin  meet once again

Jobs, page 6

gress Hall in Philadelphia came just a
day after Schwarzenegger declared a fis-
cal crisis in the nation’s most populous
state. Schwarzenegger called for what he
described as “hundreds of billions” in
spending on ready-to—go infrastructure
projects, including 328 billion alone in
California during the next several years.

The California Republican also backed
a $10 billion investment in high—speed
rail.

“There’s ‘no reason in America we

should be traveling the same speed we

were 100 years ago,” Schwarzenegger
said.

Other governors chimed in with their
proposals for restoring the economy, in-

T cluding programs out of North Carolina

and Florida that aim to slow foreclosures
and keep people in their homes.

Alaska_ Gov. Sarah Palin '—— who on a

Tuesday met with Obama and Vice Pres-
ident—elect Joe Biden for the first time
since the election — stayed largely out of
the limelight, but said that like Sanford,

she has some doubts about accruing ad-

ditional debt.

“We still have great concerns about,
perhaps the philosophy even, when much
of the economic problems we’re facing
today were caused by too much debt,” she
said. “And solving the problems will not
come from incurring more debt.”

Alaska, however, is looking toward a-
massive infrastructure project to ensure
the long—term economic stability of a
state where oil revenue fuels the, budget: a
$40 billion natural gas pipeline that Palin
said she spoke about with Biden.

Almost all of the nation’s governors‘

attended the session, held in the same
historic buildings where, in the 17805,
the country’s founders grappled with a

‘C transition in power, how to pay for a war,
. increasing government debt and rising in-

ﬂation. _
_ Of the 59 state and territorial gover-

T nors who are.members of the NGA, 48

Yesterday, Pittsburgh City
Council voted in favor of a pos-
sibly ineffectual new gun con-
trol bill. '

According to the legi_slation,
Pittsburgh gun owners who fail
to report their lost or stolen gun
within 24 hours will be charged
with ﬁnes and could, even be
sent to , M

The bill states that those who
do not report their lost or stolen
guns can face a $500 ﬁne. If it
happens again, violators will
face a $1,000 ﬁne and the likeli-
hood of 90 days in 

It is now up to Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl to decide whether
to veto the bill. Ravenstahl told
the Pittsburgh Tribune—Review,
“My concern is that this legisla-

Ravenstahl is correct. There
is no doubt that guns are dan-
gerous weapons that, when in
the wrong hands, leadito dan-
gerous criminal activity. But this
particular piece of legislation
might not work. _

A similar lost—and—stolen gun
reporting law in Cleveland, for
instance, has been difﬁcult to
implement. The law, which has
been in effect for 12 years, has

Philadelphia’s lost—and—sto-

problem in 1996. The issue was
sent to the state Supreme Court,

‘ which ruled that it is the job -of

council, to write gunlaws.
Ravenstahl told the Pitts-
burgh Post—Gazette, “It’s just a
matter of whether it is a legal

would all agree that it’s not.”
W/hile ending gun crime is
an important and positive goal,
lawmakers seem to have lost
their focus in trying to reach that
goal. Legislators should look to

the examples of Cleveland and ,
Philadelphia to reevaluate the A

The Giles Files

Obama fails

   

by Giles Howard
Caiumrzidt A

The keystone of the 
can Party’s national strategy over
the past few decades has been the

carefully cultivated public impres-'
sion that Democrats are “weak on *

defense.” _
From pictures of Michael Du-
kakis looking ridiculous in a bat-
tle tank to the scurrilous attacks
against Sen. John Kerry’s military
record, . the Republican media
machine has largely succeeded in
painting Democrats as unable to
protect our nation. '-
These attacks, when perpe-

trated by the right wing, are so

commonplace as not _to be no-
ticed in today’s political discourse.
However, in the course of the last
week, the Democratic president-
elect has actively undermined his

own and his. party’s defense cre-»_

dentials.

By announcing I the retention‘

of Robert Gates as secretary'of
defense, Barack Obama has es-

- M sentially capitulated to Republican

propaganda.

To campaign against the poli- 0

Defense Department and then re-
tain Gates as its director in his new

cabinet is not only inexplicable ——i

it’s an abomination.
Put simply, change and conti-

nuity are two different things, and

although Obama campaigned on

'the former, he appears to be ac-

complishingthe latter. .
The only reason that Obama

was a viable candidate in the first,

place was his clear and‘ early op-
position to the war in Iraq. Obama

This isn’t'just about winning
the propaganda war between the
two parties.

The public perception that
hawkish Republicans better serve
the defense ‘of this nation than
their Democratic colleagues has

justiﬁed too many disastrous for- -

eign escapades. .
Simply think back to 2002 and
the debate leading up to the war in
Iraq, when Democratic opponents
of the war were publicly ridiculed
and their commitment to their
country’s security was mocked.
Facing the pressure of a rnid—
term election and a masterfully
executed propaganda campaign
mounted by the right, Democrats
capitulated and authorized the use
of force against Iraq. ‘

Students, stop using dining dollars today

my dining dollars here and there, -

by Matthew Diabes

Colummat

It’s getting to be that time
again. One day mimics summer;
the next day is a small blizzard.
The winter holiday, some snow-
ﬂakes and ﬁnals are hanging in
the air. Yes, it’s a feeling I have
come to know quite well. A

Actually, that’s not true at all.

I’m a freshman. I’ve never expe- ,

rienced a time like this before.
However, despite my lack of
knowledge about much of any-
thing (including the existence of
Student Government Board) on
the college horizon, I -have decid-
. ed to disclose one piece of advice
from my position of knowing
nothing. . I i ,
This is directed to other
freshmen who also have no col-
lege experience. Don’t be fooled
7- exams are not the things on
. everybody’s minds. Exams are
not what you should be think-
ing about or preparing for. Don’t
even worry" about getting a new
coat to deal with the Pittsburgh

 

- weather.

What needs to be your top pri-
ority soon — or better yet, right
now — is simple: dining dollars.
Don’t spend them.

Like all good leaders of a
movement, I have not followed
my own advice. I already have
bailed ‘myself out, one might say,
and it has_given me the freedom

\ to give any piece of advice I deem
worthy. ‘ I ' .
- About a month ago, I left with
my breadsticksj at Schenley_ Cafe,
and I was told I had a balance of
$293.15. That’s when it hit me.
I had fallen into the rhythm of
Market‘ Central that seemed so‘
trendy at the time.

I almost completely forgot I
had this other half of my meal
plan. I was so well-adapted to the

Market Central way of life that ‘

I caught myself swiping for a
cookie, a soda, a glass of milk or
sometimes just to walk by Tutto
Fresco and reminisce about the
squash gnocchi. I even purchased
my own fork to bring with me
just in case. I i i

I started frantically using up

buying cartons of milk, fruit to
which I was allergic, candy to
share with friends, large mochas
at every cafe I passed —- anything
to get rid of these pesky dining

‘dollars so I didn’t feel like my en-

tiresemester of eating had been
in vain. However, ' something
even- more frightening -began
to happen as I started replacing
my 3605 with Chick-ﬁl-As and
my Basic Kneads with Freshens.
I- had more than 100 dining hall
passes!

This was an emergency. I called
together my advisory board (look

for us in future SGB elections:

Our slate is Students Eat) and
demanded that a plan be brought
forward on this issue before our
next meal.

_ This is what we came up with:
Go to Quick Zone before the last
two weeks of the semester. Use
up all remaining $293.15 on tea
and Starbursts, and for anythingl
might need the rest of the semes-
ter, frivolously swipe into'Market
Central.—— even if it’s just for a
napkin or two.

What an experience that was
at the checkout of Quick Zone.

“How many teas is that?”

- “35.” A

“Oh.”

“I think I’m ‘using some of
these as gifts.”

In fact, I had to be checked
out on three separate receipts
because so many items had to
be rung up. Quick’Zone should

I definitely invest in a quantity but-

ton, too, because the lady at the
checkout had to push the button
35 times. -

It was all a bit awkward. The
kid behind me had two cartons
of chocolate bars. I assume he
was there _for the same reason.
And I bet there’s no button on.
the register for an entire carton
of chocolate.

Anyway, I have successfully
whittled down my dining dollars
to $15.23, and I have more than

, 50 dining passes that I am work-

ing on wasting. I definitely feel a
sense of accomplishment know-
ing that, as a freshman, I have
sidestepped the horrible rush
on Quick Zone in the ﬁnal week

of the semester. For the rest of
mypeers in the freshman class,
I recommend that you just claim
ignorance and let your dining dol-
lars disappear into the fathomless
black hole of winter break.

But .why would I suggest
such a waste of money? Maybe
if enough people say they didn’t
realize it, they will be able to
get some sort of refund. I don’t
know.

I’m probably just being self-
ish. I probably don’t want the

nice ladies at Quick Zone to push .

the tea button on the register
anymore. Plus, if you just “didn’t
know,” I’m sure that would go
over much better than what I said
to my parents. I mean, imagine
what my call home was like when
I told them, “I spent more than
$250 of your money today — no,
not on that winter coat I’ve been
needing — I spent it on candy.
Oh yeah, and eight boxes of ce-
real.”

Need some more excellent advice?
How about a’ box of tea? Serioaxl ,
just take one: maa'750@pz'tz‘. edu.

In appointing Gates, Obama betrays campaign for change

Howard, page 10

Iraq possessed "no weapons of
mass destruction. I '

Obama had a chance to articu-
late this message clearly when he

chose his national security team. .

The decision to nominate antiwar
Democrats to key cabinet posi-
tions such as Defense and State
would have served as a clear rebut-
tal to the Republican machine and

‘' its allies in the Pentagon who got
us wherewe are today. - _
Regrettably, Obama chose to
retain in his cabinet a man who
envisions a long-term presence for
I American combat forces in Iraq.
The question now is whether
Obama will move forward to'de—
liver on his campaign promise to

extricate U.S. forces from Iraq ‘

swiftly. His choice of Gates seems
to signal that he’ would not be
moving in this direction.

This is a huge political and

ideological setback for both the

American left and the Democratic
Party. ' .

A partythat needed to be 

lied in order to govern this nation

‘effectively during economic and

foreign -crises  now face divi-
sions over what should have been

one of Ob_ama’s simpler choices.

The character and direction
of Obama’s presidency is being
revealed. in the individuals he is
choosing to lead key government
departments. A

Certainly, recreating the Clin-
ton adrninistxation with just _ a

_ tinge of Bush conservatism is not

what the American people elected
Obama to do. ,
Gates is but one indicator that
the Obama we thought we knew
during the election will not be
moving into the White House in

January.

There are many childhood fantasies that will
never come true. People don’t grow up to be
pirates or princesses, and they can’t ﬂy through
space or walk with dinosaurs Or can they?

“\X/alking with Dinosaurs” is a theatnical
production at Mellon Arena featuring 15
animatronic dinosaurs and more than 200
million years of evolution, ﬁom the deserts of
the Triassic period to the prairies of the later
Jurassic period.

The character Huxley," a paleontologist, guides
the audience on a prehistoric adventure Based
on a BBC television series of the same name, the
show depicts interactions among the dinosaurs
set against the backdrop of the environmental
changes that shaped — and ultimately ended — i
the lives of the prehistoric giants.

“This has been six years in the  Quite

Vista cusing even more problems for Nlicrosoft

by Donald Campbell  ii‘

Colummldt

    
 

Microsoft has done it again.

Everyone remembers that
when Vista came out, it had some,
well, compatibility, issues. Some
machines were‘. simply too slow

to be compatible. Vista proved
to be a rather memory-intensive
operating system with its primary
visual features enabled. "Microsoft
suggests, in order for Vista users
to be happy, that Visf:a'—runnmg

- machines be rather hefty.

Microsoft is in a spot of trou-

ble, as it claimed that many com-

puters were Vista basic before the
average computer on the market’

was able to meet the demands of
the upper echelons of the Vista
operating system family.
Microsoft is in so much trou-
ble that court proceedings have

begun; the case is now consid-

ered a.class_action suit, much to

the  of Ivﬁcrosoft execu-
tives. Th :proceedings are also
serious engiugh to require Steve
Ballmer,.  fcrosoft’s CEO, to tes-

': Microsoftis excessive

  

protests. 

To illustrate the point the plain-
tiffs in this new anti—Microsoft
case make, take a typical example.
My old Pentium 4, running at 2.8
gliz, can run Vista. It is, however,
a little intimidating. If I ever want
to continue using my machine
efﬁciently, I have to downgrade

arrison Keillor brings prairie to Pitt

by Samantha Stahl
S tzzﬁ’ l/VI'£.f6l'

Garrison Keillor

Heinz Hall
Dec. 3, 8 pm.
A 412-392-4900
Tickets available only for Pittsburgh
Speaker Series subscribers

Garrison Keillor, the American writer
and radio A personality known for his
satirical sense of humor, will speak this
evening at Heinz Hall as part of Robert
Morris University’s‘ Pittsburgh Speaker
Series. Q . ‘

As a freshman at the University of
Minnesota in the l960s,.Keillor began his
radio career. He ventured through various
shows while simultaneously working on
his writing. In 1974 he "began “A Prairie
Home Companion,” a variety show now
played on NPR featuring musicians and
comedy skits. '

With 12 books under his belt, an
advice column on Salon.com and writing

   ‘

published in The New Yorker and The
Atlantic Monthly, Keillor has managed
to leave his mark on just about every
medium.

Keillor is much more than an author

or radio host — he’s a cultural icon. His

deep voice is frequently used in Honda
UK commercials and parodied on “The
Simpsons.” They Might Be Giants credits’
him as the inspiration for its first venue
song, while Pennsylvania—based singer

A Torn Flannery wrote a song titled, “I Want

ajob Like Garrison Keillor’s.”

“Sometimes we include in a season’s
lineup an evening of humor, ‘particularly
when we feel the person’s’ humor is
brilliant and enduring, such as in the case
with Garrison-:«Keillor,” said Bill Conrow,
president of Cambridge Speaker Series
and the organizer of the series here in
Pittsburgh.

. This year’s series will also feature
distinguished lecturers like investigative
journalist Bob Woodward and
environmental researcher Jane Goodall.
Conrow explained that Cambridge Speaker
Seriesworks with agencies about a year in

Vista-‘capable labels lead

to lawsuit for Nlicrosoft A

Vista, page 12

to Windows XP. Mycomputer is capable,
though, of running Windows Vista Home
Basic. Microsoft and Dell specifically la-

beled my. computer — retroactively - as Vis- T

ta capable. My Dell Inspiron, running an
Intel Core Duo 1.6 gHz machine capable
of running the l\/[icrosoft Windows Vista

_ Ultimate installations provided by Pitt, was

labeled as “Vista Ready.”

So, run" Vista Basic. There is a prob-
lem with this, however. Many people do
not fully consider this Windows Vista, as

it does not include a series of keyifeatures ‘

that Microsoft touted as being new addi-
tionsto Vista. _ _

Although Vista Home Basic includes the
basic core of the Vista operating system, it
does not give the user interface that is»syn—
onymous with an upgrade from XP to Vis-
ta. A quick view of the Microsoft Website

I yields the conclusion that Windows Vista

Home. Basic‘ is extremely stripped down
and provides almost no useful features. - A
Microsoft doesn’t even put a check
mark next to “Easily make DVDS ...” when
discussing Windows Vista Home Basic.
Fine. Don’t buy Vista Basic, and contin-
ue to run Windows XP. The problem with
this is that people bought their computers
to be Vista machines in good faith. They
put their conﬁdence in the fact that Micro-

soft and its hardware partners accurately

. estimated the capabilities of their machines

and would not in any way inﬂate their abili-

ties to‘ include the updated Microsoft oper— '

ating system. The class action suit alleges
that Microsoft made money it would not
otherwise make had it accurately portrayed
the requirements of Vista and not pushed
to have the label “Vista-capable” placed on
machines that were only capable of com-
fortably running Windows‘ Vista Home
Basic. , ’

Microsoft responded to the initial. suit
by alleging -that the circiumstances were

too complicated to make a tie between the

“Vistaapable” label and any malicious ac-
tions by Microsoft. .

The judge ruled that because of the
questionability of the -‘feature list included
in Windows Vista Home Basic, the suit

should be considered 'a class action, and j
- arguments from the plaintiffs should be

heard as such. .

If you bought your machine after about
Christmas 2006, you should be ﬁne for
Vista. You might want to hold out for Win-
dows 7, though. After all this hype about
Windows Vista, Microsoft seems to have
abandoned it and is looking to the future.
I wonderwhat Steve Ba1lrner"will tell the
court. _ '

The show also won aTl-IEA Award in 2007 in
the Outstanding Achievement in Touring Event
category, a distinction recognizing excellence in

\X/hile the show’s educational slant is geared
toward younger children, Ross said it is definitely
an experience that all ages can enjoy. “We all
remember learning about these animals in science
class when we were younger, and to actually see
them and be taken back to that is pretty exciting
for anyone. I’ve deﬁnitely seen people on first
dates come to the show.”

A show as unique as this comes with unique
challenges. Ross remarked on the nature of the
show’s stars. A

“In most theatiical shows, you’re working
with a lot of actors. \Well, our actors are
dinosaurs And as much as we maintenance
them, they can be unpredictable. Not being able
to communicate with them poses a challenge.”

Despite the four engineers who travel with

the show to provide daily tuneups, the dinosaurs '
, sometimes malfunction or even cease working

altogether. Ross assured that this is a rarity and
that the majority of shows go without hitches,
which is impressive given the complexity

' involved with staging the production.

A team of three people operate each

Pittsburgh rivals clash tonight

by Ben  '
Staﬁ’ Wrtter

It might not be a rivalry as
notorious as the Backyard Brawl,
but whenever Pitt and Duquesne
match up, there’s always a special
feel. V A

The Panthers are coming into
Wednesday’s game ranked No. 3
in the nation. - . .

A 7-0 start for Pitt, combined
'with a Louisvilleloss on Sunday,
propelled the team to the rank-
ing. '

Duquesne started the sea-
son strong, winning its first four

’ games before being torched by

, Duke at Cameron Indoor 95-72

on Friday afternoon.

Even with the loss at Duke,
it’s tough to argue against the rise
in the Duquesne program as of
late.

After only winning three
games three years ago, the team
has won seven more games in
each of the past two seasons. 4

The Dukes kept the game
close against Pitt one year ago.
The Panthers, who were ranked

I No. 19 in the nation, grinded out

a 73-68 win.

Sophomore forward Gilbert
Brown said he knows that the
game will have a special ﬂare
come tip—off. J

“It. may not be as big as the
West Virginia game, but it’s just
as good,” said~Brown. “It’s an
inner—city rivalry, and we’re go-
ing to have to go out and play our
best.” ‘

' Pitt coach Jamie Dixon said he
agrees with Brown, claiming that
the game isn’t just an ordinary
out—of—conference matchup.

“There’s definitely something
different when we play a team
that’s in the city,” said Dixon.

The biggest game story, how-
ever, might be the matchup be-

tween two guards: Pitt senior

Levance Fields and Duquesne
senior Aaron Jackson.

Jackson averages nearly 16

' points and six assists per game

this season, while Fields averages
12 points and six assists.

Dixon said that he knowsihow
important Fields is on the floor
to his team and also knows what
Jackson means to Duquesne.

“I have great respect for Jack-
son,” said Dixon.‘ “He’s a guy that
plays hard, and he’s . really im-
proved.” '

The Panthers also Swill be

forced to address sophomore
forward Damian Saunders, the
team’s leading scorer.

Saunders is coming off a 22-
point effort against Duke, going
9-of-13 from the ﬁeld and snag-
ging 10 rebounds.

In Pitt’s matchup
Washington State, the Cougars
double—teamed DeJuan Blair
every time he touched the ball,
which turned out to be a very ef-
fective strategy.

Blair was held to a season—low

Pitt fans, take a deep breath.
You deserve it.

On Friday afternoon, your
Pitt football team escaped with a
 against West Virginia, Even
more than that, it escaped from
Pat White, who might be the best
dua1'—threat quarterback ever to
play college football. Thankfully
for you, he’ll never turn the Heinz
Field turf into a track again.

Don’t think has the best? At
least look at the numbers.

White’s 4,385 yards rushing

0 is more than any quarterback in

NCAA history. He has more than
double the yards on the ground
of any other Big East quarterback
in history, and he has put together

Panther Women look to
on streak tonight

Pitt sophomore guard Sophronia Sallard and the rest of the Panthers’ guards will be
facing a tough group of Duquesne guards tonight. ,

On a_ night when the Pitt men’s basket-
ball team plays its annual “City Game” against
Duquesne, the Pit women’s basketball team will
do the same

, Heading into tonight’s game at the A].
Palumbo Center, the Panthers (4-1) are riding a

land them at No. 24 in the latest AP poll.

Duiing the  Tournament at Pitt,
the Panthers rolled- past-Elon and Youngstown
State by an average of 44 points per game

Duquesne (6-1), which is  led by first-
year coach and Pittsburgh basketball legend Su-
zie McConnell-Seiio, heads into the game on a
sour note after suffering its ﬁrst loss of the sea-
son to Towson 59,-56. _

Serio, a Pittsburgh native and member of

had a storied career. She played and coached
in the WNBA, won a gold medal with the US.

Duquesne, a team that relies on its guards to
carry it, is counting on senior guard Kristi Little
and junior guards Ken Pryor and Rachel Freder-

Little leads the team in scoring with 13.3
points and is followed closely by Pryofs 11.7 and
Fredeiick’s 11.4. " _

But Pitt has some guards of its own who
have shown up to play this year.

Pitt bowl

by Kyle Craig
Staff W/riter

With one game left to play in the regular
season, it still isn’t clear where or when the
Panthers will play _their bowl game. In fact,
there are a handful of bowls in which Pitt
could ﬁnd itself, depending on how the last
week of action unfolds.

_Technically, Pitt could participate in the
~Papa]ohns.com Bowl, the Meineke Car Care
Bowl, the Sun Bowl, the Gator Bowl, the In-
ternational Bowl or the St. Petersburg Bowl.
Still, they’re not all legitimate scenarios.

This week, Sun Bowl chairman John Fol-
mer told the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette that

he might be interested in bringing Pitt to El .

Paso, Texas —— that is, if Pitt is able to beat

Connecticut and Rutgers defeats Louisville.
A Rutgers victory would make the

Knights bowl—eligible and would contrac-

tually prevent the Sun Bowl from selecting

Notre Dame.

Otherwise, if ' Pitt loses to Connecticut,
or if the Sun Bowl is allowed to select Notre
Dame, the Panthers could travel to Birming-
ham, Ala., for the Papajohnscom Bowl to
play a team from the Sun Belt Conference.

Itwas initially believed that Pitt had a
chance to land in the Gator Bowl and play
on New Year’s Day.

   

SCHOLARSHIP

But it now appears that the Gator Bowl
will be selecting a representative from the
Big 12 Conference. _

The entire bowl picture is far from being
settled, and because of a number of differ-
ent stipulations, the ﬁnal result is difficult to
predict.

 

Our guys would like to end up with
nine [regular season] wins. That
hasn't been done around here in over a
quarter-century.

Dave

Wannstedt

 

With that in mind, Pitt coach Dave
Wannstedt is trying to focus on the things
that the Panthers can control.

“Our guys would like to end up with
nine [regular season] wins,” said Wannstedt.
“That hasn’t been done around here in over
a quarter-century. That would be a nice 
for our football team to accomplish. That’s
kind of our focus more than what bowl
[we’re going to play in], because wehave no
clue.” '

picture still a bit hazy

More Honors for McKillop, McCoy

Middle linebacker Scott McKillop was
named Big East Defensive Player of the
Week for the fourth time this season.

This week, McKillop was "recognized for
his efforts that helped stymie West Virginia’s
powerful offense for a second straight year.

McKillop ﬁnished Friday’s contest with a
team-high seven tackles against the Moun-
taineer offense. _

He currently leads the nation with 6.91
solo tackles per game and is 12th in the na-
tion with 10.27 total tackles per game.

The senior linebacker is also -making
progress in Pitt’s record books. He now has
320 total tackles throughout his collegiate ca-
reer, a mark that ranks 12th in Pitt history. '

McKillop only needs eight more tackles
to tie former-Panther Ramon Walker for
11th place. .

Meanwhile, Pitt tailback. LeSeani McCoy
will enter Saturday’s game as the reigning
Big East Offensive Player of the Week. The
sophomore running back ran for a career-
high 183 yards against West Virginia and

scored two crucial fourth—quarter touch-

downs.

seven points and only tookitwo ﬁeld—goal
attempts that night.
It wouldn’t be a surprise for Blair to see

similar defensive strategies from Duquesne. ll

Pitt’s standout forward said that dealing
with the double team is something that he
needs to improve.

“I was getting really frustrated when
they doubled me,” said Blair. “But we
worked a lot on dealing with [it] in prac-
tice.” H '

It’s no mystery why opponents are try-
ing to keep the ball out of Blair’s hands.
He’s currently shooting an incredible 70

percent from the ﬁeld, while the next high— 

est shooting percentage_ by a starter is Sam
Young’s 52 percent from the field.

If you’re not convinced this is a rivalry,
ask the Panthers what they thought of the
chants of “overrated” coming from .the
Duquesne fans in the ﬁnal minutes of last
year’s contest.

This time around, the Panthers are try-

ing to ensure the word “overrated” isn’t A

heard.

UPMC seeks smokers for research on the
shortterm effects of a Food and Drug Admin-

(varenicline), on smoking behavior, craving,
and mood. This is not a treatment study.

You will first have a brief physical exam.
The study has two phases, each three weeks
long. Each phase involves a brief practice
quit attempt over 5 days. You will visit

the lab for 10-15 minutes on three to ﬁve
days each week. Visits will be scheduled
between the hours of 11 am. and 6 pm. i
You will be asked to take study medication
that may or may not contain Chantix.
Participants who complete the entire study,
will receive $595.

All participantswiii be given free written
materials on quitting smoking at the end
of the last session. Optional treatment
involving brief counseling and Chanﬁx will
also be offered without charge.
