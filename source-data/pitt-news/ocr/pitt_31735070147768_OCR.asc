Amnesty policy passed in state Senate

Mallory Grossrnan
News Editor

A new bill could challenge
Pitt’s longstanding stance
against an amnesty policy.
.The Pennsylvania State
Senate unanimously passed
legislation last week -that
would provide legal amnesty
for minors if they call emer-

gencywservices to help another
intoxicated person who needs
medical attention.

Senate Bill 448, sponsored
by State Sen. John Rafferty,
R—Montgomery, would grant
immunity to a minor who,
when underage drinking is
involved, calls 911 for a friend
who needs emergency ser-
vices. '

The onlystipulation is that
the caller must provide his or
her first and last name to the
911 operator and must stay
with the person until para—
medics arrive. The bill now
heads to the House for con-
sideration.

Pitt has a zero-tolerance
policy when it comes to under-

age drinking, and in the past

has declined to implement an
amnesty policy. Currently, the
University’s policy does not
address the issue of under-
age students seeking medi-
cal attention for intoxication.
Underage students who are
caught drinking by Pitt police
are subject to criminal cita-
tions and University judicial
sanctions, according to the

Student Code of Conduct. ’
In‘ 2009,11 students were

given campus disciplinary’

referrals for liquor law Vio-
lations —— four of which took
placelat on—campus facilities
+ and 108 were arrested by
the Pitt police, according to
the Pitt police’s crime report.

Dixon highest paid Pitt official again

Alex Oltmanns
Assistant News Editor

Jamie Dixon, Pit_t’s head basketball
coach, topped the University’s sal-
ary rolls in 2009 with nearly $1.7
million in total compensation.

According to federal tax forms, 3

Dixon topped the list of University
employees for the fourth straight
year.

The salaries for the Pitt employ-
ees are on the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice forms ﬁled two weeks ago by
the University, which can be found
on the Oﬂice of the Chief Financial
Officer website. Tax-exempt, pri-
vate organizations like Pitt have to
report ﬁll out IRS form 990 by May
15 which releases the earnings of

their top ﬁve non-officer employ-
ees as well as other organizational
employees.

The forms also include the total
amount that University officials re-
ceive in non-salary compensation,
which is sometimes considerably
more than their yearly pay. In Dix-
on’s case, he received more than
$830,000 in incentives in addition
to his $690,000 base salary.

Dixon is joined by three other
athletic ofﬁcials in the top four,
with former head football coach
Dave Wannstedt at No. 2, athletic
director Steve Pederson at No. 3
and women’s basketball head coach
Agnus Berenato at No. 4.

Associate vice chancellor for
global health and dean of the Grad-
uate School of Public Health Donald

Burke rounds out the top ﬁve, with
$464,017. .
The form released earlier this
month, states Dixon, who’s led the
Panthers to the NCAA Tournament
in each of his eight seasons as Pitt’s
head coach, earned $1,692,852 in
total for the year, including perfor-
mance incentives outlined in his
contract. '
Wannstedt, who resigned as
head coach in December 2010,

earned $1,434,331 in total com-

pensation.
Pederson made $599,807 and

Berenato earned $495,004 in total.

compensation. 3
The ﬁling also includes informa-
tion on the University’s top-paid ad-
ministrators. The highest earning
University administrators for the

year were Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg, who took in $691,413 in
total compensation, and Dr. Arthur
Levine, who earned $803,707 in
total compensation as Pitt’s senior

- vice chancellor for the health sci-

ences and clean of the School of
Medicine. ' '

Former Provost James Maher
earned $440,215 in _total compen-
sation while Executive Vice Chan-
cellor Jerome Cochran and Chief
Financial Ofﬁcer Arthur Ramicone
earned $537,099 and $396,339, re-
spectively in total compensation to
round out the top ﬁve paid univer-
sity senior ofﬁcers.

The information on the IRS form
was for the ﬁscal year endingjune
30, 2009, but the information was
for the calendar year 2008. I

State policy might change

the students.

Alex Zimmerman, an SGB Board
member, met with Pitt’s Alcohol Task
Force in March to discuss possibly im-
plementing a school amnesty policy.

Zimmerman, along with two other
SGB board members, met with the
task force and other Pitt administra-
tors to discuss Pitt’s alcohol policy.

Alex Zimmerman:

Likewise, the student who calls uni-
versity police or the EMS for the in-
toxicated student will also be granted
amnesty if the student remains with
the intoxicated person until medical
help arrives. ‘

Pitt spokesman John Fedele de-
clined to comment on the new leg-
islation and what it would mean for
Pitt.

[There are e lot of stories that

emergency.

Zimmerman said that the meeting ——
which discussed the policy that affects
the entire student body — was con-
ﬁdential and couldn’t speak about it.
But he did have an opinion as a student
on the new legislation and the effects
it would have on campus.

Speaking on behalf of himself and
not the Board, Zimmerman said that
he is really interested in the new leg-
islation that would require colleges
and universities to take student health
seriously.

, “One reason I’m interested in this
project is because I think alcohol poli-
cies aren’t reﬂective of the realities
of drinkingon campus and student

R health concerns,” he said.”

Zimmerman said that he thinks stu-
dents shou1dn’t necessarily have to be

‘concerned with legal ramiﬁcations

help for a medical emergency.

Dr. Donald Yealy, the chair of the
department of emergency medicine
at Pitt, said that Pitt’s emergency
services never‘ call the police speciﬁ-
cally for an underage drinker unless
another event, such as aggressive be-
havior, is involved, or if people need
transport home.

He said that emergency services
contacting police is a “false urban
myth” based on students telling part

of a story. .
“We’re not in the business of iden-

tifying underage drinking. We’re not
in the law enforcement business, and
we don’t want to be,” Yealy said.
Rafferty, who has also been the au-
thor of tougher laws to prevent under-
age drinking, said on his website that
the purpose of this new legislation is
“to protect public safety and prevent
needless tragedy.” »
“Underage drinking is a serious
matter, and we don’t want to give
minors a free pass,” Rafferty said on
his website. “But if kids are in trouble
and need medical attention, we don’t
want to discourage those who can help
them from seeking assistance.”
Zimmerman agrees with Rafferty.
“There isn’t a whole lot of data
available to me of whether or not Pitt
police are citing a lot of underagers
that would fall under an amnesty pol-
icy if we had one,” he said. “But there
are a lot of stories that really make it

"clear that students are afraid of con-

tacting the police or medical services

an alcohol emergency.” E

Procrastination did not stop a Pitt neu-
roscience student from winning a pres-

tigious summer scholarship.

Sophomore Tim Ohlsen was awarded
a place in one of the Fulbright Commis-
sion’s Summerllnstitutes, which will
take him all the way to Newcastle, in
Northeast England. He will leave later
this month to take science classes at

_ Newcastle University for ﬁve weeks.

“When I found out I got in, I really
freaked out,” said Ohlsen, who willbe
going to England for the ﬁrst time.

The application process involved an
initial‘ application that the Fulbright

ic excellence but a focused application, a

activities, demonstrated ambassadorial
skills, a desire to ﬁ1rther the Fulbright

turning,” according to the press release
issued by the Fulbright commission.

The Fulbright program is a bilateral
exchange program between the U.S. and
the U.K., established in 1948 as a way to
build a special cultural bond between the
two countries. ‘ ‘

Ohlsen said that the point of the Ful-

Commission described as “rigorous” ‘

understanding, and he said he is looking

“When you get into more special-
ized ﬁelds, people in that ﬁeld are not
going to just be from Pitt, or just from
America. They are going to be from all
over,” he said.

Ohlsen said that cross—cultura1 under-
standing is an important tool for scien-
tists, pointing to one global neuroscience
study that encompassed 400 scientists
from all across the world as an example
of collaboration across cultures.

“I only see more of thatsort of thing
happening in the future,” he said.

Ohlsen’s former mentor, A. Chan-
dan Khandai, a graduate neuroscience
student who worked with Ohlsen in
J. Patrick Card’s lab, saidthat Ohlsen
stood out from other students he has
mentored. »

“Tim stood out because of his tenac- ‘

ity,” Khandai said. “If there is a setback,
he will keep working at it until it be-
comes successful.” . ' .

Khandai also praised Ohlsen for his
pragmatic vision for the future-

“He understands that if things don’t
work out for you, you need to make them
wor ,” said Khandai. He said this is an
attribute that he thinks will make Ohlsen
successful abroad. _

Even with that drive, Ohlsen still said
he fell into the same trap as a lot of col-

lege students do‘: procrastination. He
said he had yet to make summer plans

when he came across the summer pro-‘

gram in, an email from the University
Honors College.
After the initial application, Ohlsen

also completed an interview before re- p ‘

ceiving the position during Finals week
last month. ’ ‘ .'

He said he "sent his application in on
the day it was due and .had to spend ex-
tra money to make sure the Fulbright
program got it on time. . ’ ‘

“They got it two hours before it was
due,” he said. .

Ohlsen was one of 50 students from

both countries selected to participate in '

this summer program. .
The program will cover all of his costs

and allow him entrance into the pro- ‘

gram’s alumni network, which includes
notable politicians,‘ Nobel Prize winners,
judges, and other professionals.

The Fulbright program selected

Ohlsen for his academics as well as his .

extra-curricular activities. Ohlsen taught
a chemistry recitation for Michael Golde
and does research studying neuroanat—
omy under]. Patrick Card.

, Ohlsen said he is a big sports fan
and coaches basketball in his free time.
As a native of thetseattlef area, he said
he observed a subtle change in culture
between the West Coast and'East Coast
and wanted to continue to keep an eye
out for that while learning about English

’ culture. V.
_ But for_Ohlsen, this trip won’t just be
about studying science and culture. ‘He

says he plans on traveling throughout
England and Scotland, and he wants to
spend time learning about history as

well. . .

“I don’t know if I’m a history buff, but A

I enjoy it,” he said. ‘ .
Despite his interest in science, Ohlsen
is looking forward to learning about Eng-
lish history more than the formal science
classes he will take. , s
“This might sound bad, but I’m

- most excited to see the castles,” Ohlsen

said. I '

GOP coverage too
personality-focused

Pop‘ quiz: How much do you know
about presidential candidate Newt
Gingrich?

 If you’re like most Americans,
you’ll volunteer three facts: He was
speaker of the house in the mid- to
late-’90s, he had an affair during the

» Monica Lewinsky scandal, and he’s

been married multiple times. Hispol-
icies and ideology remain nebulous
— a footnote in the more we1l—known
narrative of his personal life.

Unless you’re a political jour-
nalist, we don’t blame you for your
limited breadth of knowledge: Thus
far, the coverage surrounding the
Republican presidential race has by
and large focused on a single topic:
candidates’ eccentricities. Gingrich
and his wife’s enormous credit line
with jewelry company Tiffany & Co.
between 2005 and 2006 has been the
subject of countless news stories over
the past few weeks. His ﬂip-ﬂopping
on Paul Ryan’s budget plan has mer-
ited considerably less attention. With
the exception of certain frontrtm—
ners -—- Mitt Romney is typically cri-
tiqued in relation to his Massachu-
setts govemment-mandated health
insurance plan —— character is the
chief criterion by which candidates
are analyzed.

Accordingly, the more C0lOI'ﬁ1l
the contender, the more media atten-
tion he’ll garner. Take, for example,
the only recently dissipated frenzy
surrounding former presidential
hopeful Donald Trump, whose lack
of a coherent agenda didn’t stop news
outlets like The New Yorker, The New
York Times and Slate from fervently
publicizing his egotistical charades
— making him, for a time, the most
visible ﬁgure in the entire race. And
now that’s he’s stepped down, there
are other, equally ostentatious can-
didates that will likely take his place.
The Tea Party-cheerleading Michele

Bachmann, the ever—unpredictable.

Sarah Palin and even the outspoken
but politically inexperienced former

CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, Herman
Cain.

We don’t think this cult of celeb-
rity is damaging merely because it
obscures the merits of worthy can-
didates. Rather, itchanges the na-
ture of the race. When politicians are
noticed only for outsized personali-
ties, it forces everyone to campaign
accordingly, inﬂating their stage
presence and streamlining their
agendas.

Of course, if our previous experi-
ence is any indication, the media’s
ﬁxationon personalitywill eventually
abate.]ournalists are wary of making
too big a hubbub about acandidate’s
stance on a certain issue early in the
race forfear that every candidatewill
turn out to share that person’s posi-
tion. Once the lineup thins out, prob-
ing candidates’ policies will become
considerably safer.

Nevertheless, the current one-
dimensionality of coverage is dis-
heartening and sells short some of
the most viable ﬁgures in the race.

In fact, here’s another pop quiz:
Ever heard of Jon Huntsman ]r.? A
former ambassador to China with
business experience and a socially
moderate outlook, the erstwhile gov-
ernor ofUtah might just be the most
genuine threat to the Obama presi-
dency if he indeed decides to run.
But Huntsman is not an eccentric,
and he has little in his personal life
to merit attention, besides perhaps
his Mormon faith. So for the time
being, his more ﬂamboyant, more
illustrious colleagues have largely
precluded his entrance into the pub-
lic consciousness. .

We’ll likely hear more about
Huntsman later down the line —
Time Magazine, at least, recently

proﬁled him 4- but for now, he’s-

an extra in a show devoted to the
Sarah Palins of the GOP. Hopefully
the media will readjust its priorities
before the end of the Republican
primaries. I

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

 

Dispatches fm a fal

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

20th-century classical music of-
ten feels like an assault on the
ears, but‘I do enjoy some pieces;
particularly when they have a very
good ‘reason for sounding strange.
A textbook_example is “La Valse”
by Maurice Ravel. The number
begins in an unsettling fashion
with some muttering of the wood-
winds and gradually develops
into a-grandiose and pompous
waltz. Then the sound begins to
disintegrate and sag under a kind
of weight, slowly breaking into a
series of grotesque and tortured
fragments. Finally, the piece ends
with five sharp notes, dissipated
and unresolved. ‘

Ravel intended this piece as a ,

commentary on 19th— and early
20th-century Europe, which,
while glittering on the outside,
rotted internally, dying its own
tortured death in the mud of
World War 1. “La Valse” seems
especially appropriate when con-
sidering the decline and death of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
which left a legacy of decaying
architecture and the present
chaos in the Balkans — a chaos
that embroiled America’s military
in the 90s, and threatens to do so
again, if a new, malignant power
emerges

This predicament has weighed
heavily on my mind the last few
days because I’ve traveled through
some of the ashes of that empire
— starting in Krakow, Poland,
going through Budapest, Hun-
gary, and winding up eventually
in Zvornik, in eastern Bosnia and
Herzegovina‘. -

The remnants of Austria- Hun-
gary’s dual monarchy l—' which
collapsed in a series of revolu-
tions and partitions and other
strife after being on the losing

end of World War I — are both‘

visible and invisible and, in all
cases, depressing. Baja, in Hun-
gary, has all the markings of a
once-prosperous town: The city
hall takes up half a block and is.
ﬁve stories tall, with a kind of
bogus-Vienna type facade. The
town square is imposing and
well-lit, ringed by hotels that
once hosted thelikes of Hungar-

For The Pitt News

Now that I’m back at home for the
summer, I’ve had to rekindle my re-
lationships with my old roommates
— that is, my mother, father, 17-year-

a old brother and 14-year-old sister.

And although I’ve been absentfor
almost eight months of their lives,
some things will never change. My
dad will always love maps and hate
GPSS, my mom will forever cringe
every time I drive her anywhere, and
my brother’s room will constantly

smell like Axe body spray. When it

comes to my sister, however, I am
forced to arrive at a new and startling
conclusion: Immature, innocent Sar-
ah has a more solid life-after-college
plan than myself, the sophomore in
college. .

I picked her up from the bus stop
one day, and, amidst her usual chat-
ter about middle school love and
which teachers smell the worst, she
started asking me some questions I
couldn’t answer. “So which graduate
degree will you’ go for? Do you even
have an internship lined up for this
summer? Why don’t you just switch

The limits of advanced planning

to the business school, because
who even cares about psychology
anymore?” I was a bit taken aback.

‘ She continued by explaining to me

her “Life Project,” an undertaking
required for eighth-grade graduation
in her school. For this project, kids
hypothetically plan out their lives
for a few years following their sup-
posed college graduation. They pick
amajor, search on Monster.com and
Craigslistfor entry-level job openings
—— they aren’t allowed togo to grad

school in this project — and then I

undergo afake “interview” with their
teacher, who will then tell them if
they landed the position. The teacher
informs them of their salaries and
then sends the children off to set up
a budget for a place to live, food and
other expenses. '
Sarah, oddly enough, received a
job as an“Assistant Zoologist” at the
Philadelphia Zoo (although I’m pretty
positive this-position doesn’t exist
at entry level, if at all). She lives in a
small apartment in Swarthmore, Pa.,
with another one of her classmates.
Their food budget is depressing:

. cereal for each breakfast, a cheese

sandwich for lunch and a choice of
one-quarter of afreezer pizza or one

ﬁst-sized piece of pork for dinner.
In the end, she was spending $400
more than she took in every month .
Really living the dream, huh?

At ﬁrst, Iwas bewildered that this
project was part of an eighth-grade
curriculum. When Iwas 14, I gave no

, thought to picking majors, let alone

the state of the job market. If I were
she I would’ve already had a nervous
breakdown about not being able to
afford clothes or relatively interest-

ﬁgured out while I’m still struggling
to solidify my major and dig up some
sort of resumé—building summer em-

~ ployment.

At the same time, as valuable as
this experience has been for her, I
can’t help but wish that she saved
these kinds of worries for her years
in high school, at the very least. It’s
natural for a junior in high school to
be anxious about college and beyond,
but eighth grade seems a little young

Immature, innocent Sarah
has a more solid life—after-I
college lan than myself,
the sop omore in college.

ing food. Despite the fact that she is
still afraid of thunder, she took all
the ﬁnancial instability in stride,
understanding to an extent how the
economy affects the job market for
freshly graduated young adults. She
now has a better grasp of the impor-
tance of doingwell in school and be-
ing well-rounded. Sad as it is for me
to say, she seems to have everything

to be adjusting your interests to ap-
pear more marketable.

Sarah despises all science, yet
chose to pursue -a hypothetical ma-
jor in biology simply because, even
at her age, she knowsthat liberal arts

majors have more trouble ﬁnding

employment with just a bachelor’s
degree. She constantly hounds my
dad about how, if he were in college

now, he would’ve never gotten into
Columbia’s medical school with a

major in religious studies and only 4

a minor in biology.

There’s something to be said for
preservingone’s innocence and keep-
ing one’s options open. After all, if
there’s one thing I’ve learned from
a mere one year at college, it’s that
life is too unpredictable to be inflex-
ible. Yes, we all must be prepared in
order to succeed, but what we must

' simultaneously keep in mind is that

nothing is ever set in stone. Itworries
me abit that my sister and her peers
are already feeling the pressure to
lay out the blueprint for their lives
at age 14.

Graduationwill be a reality check
for all of us who can’t imagine college
ever ending, and maybe some of us

‘ really do need to get our lives in order.

But in the end, Sarah’s Life Project is
just that: a project, a simulation of the
unpredictable future. Lessons canbe
learned from being prepared, but I
don’t plan on stressing too much. In
my experience, good things come to
those who work hard, regardless of
their majors, and, if it turns out I’m
wrong in three years, I’ll just have to
recalculate and move on. I

In this atmosphere, it is very easy
for aspiring despots to ﬁnd an
audience by saying, as Hitler did,
“We would still be great if not for

CONCERT REVIEW

 

Natalie Bell
A&rE Editor

On Sunday, as opening band The
Triggers left the stage without
ever announcing its name, the au-
dience chattered anxiously wait-
ing for Weezer. Flying W’s went
up whenever someone walked
on stage, and calls for the band
pierced the already noisy atmo-
sphere.

Weezer’s frontman Rivers
Cuomo greeted the audience at
Stage AE’s outdoor arena and an-
nounced that it was the band’s
first concert in Pittsburgh in nine
years. Those who’ve been wait-
ing all those years weren’t disap-
pointed as the band’s 90-minute
fast-paced set included seven
songs from its 1994 self-titled
album.

It seems that the new indoor-
outdoor concert venue has
sparked the desire for many big
names like Weezer to revisit the
’Burgh. As he wandered across
the stage during the third song

Weezer’s 90-minute show was a nerdtastic event that included all the oldies that launched the

sporting his signature thick black
glasses, Cuomo made a point to
profess some love for the Steel
City.

As an intro to “Undone —— The
Sweater Song,” he talked about
his early admiration of the Steel-
ers, expressing his childhood de-
sireto be a professional football
player. Cuomo explained that,
much to his dismay, sometime
around adolescence he realized
he’d never have the physique for
the pros —— lucky for the audi-
ence.

Weezer’s nerd rock sound was
only aided by the rawness of a
live performance. The spot—on
vocals and harmonies made for
a sound not too far off from the
band’s recordings.

The energy of the crowd sing-
ing alone and the animation of
the band —— Cuomo in particular
—- perfectly ﬁt Weezer’s garage-
band vibe.

The band launched into “Un-
done” with the shouted accom-
paniment of the audience. And

the crowd was familiar with all
the songs, even the lesser—known
jams.

When the band launched into
“Memories” from its 2010 album
Hurley as its ﬁrst song, its staying
power became immediately obvi-
ous — fans all knew the lyrics.
The crowd was refreshingly dedi-
cated, not just attending the show
for “Island in the Sun” —— which
the band did play .— but also for
songs like “Photograph.”

In return, Weezer played to its

« audience. Cuomo splashed him-

self and-the crowd with fountains
squeezed from water bottles and
grabbed the outreached hands
at the edge of the stage. At one
point, the singer climbed down
from the stage and moved out

When the band finally left the
stage, it didn’t wait around long
for an encore. Coming back out
quickly, the band left the audi-
ence with “(If You’re Wondering

and, ﬁnally, “Buddy Holly.” I

Comic prep for Batman

Fans should read these before the movie arrives

Randi Alu
Staff Writer

Production of the third installment in
Christopher Nolan’s “Batman” series
has officially begun, according to a
Warner Bros. press release from last
Wednesday. To the surprise of few
but the delight of many, Pittsburgh is
listed among the cities in which “The
Dark Night Rises” will be ﬁlmed.

So to prepare for the oncoming

Pittsburgh “bat-gasm,” here’s a few

I Batman classics that can help you C

learn the roots of the Dark Knight,
if you are so inclined.

V “Batman: YeariOne”

FrankMiller, astaple author of the
Batman series, does afantastic job of
explainingthebeginnings of Batman
while weaving in the origins of Cat-

woman andiﬁonnnissioner Gordon
— before he was commissioner, of
course. Anne Hathaway is slated by
the Warner B“r5s;‘15re'ssEé1éase to play
Selina Kyle, Catwoman’s alter ego.

' This graphic novel paved the way
for many Batman comics in style as
well as tone, and Nolan’s ﬁlms draw a
lotfrom “Year One”—-— from costum-

. ing to blocking.

If you like f‘Batrrjan: Year One,” I
also recommend “The Dark Knight
Returins.” Like Year One, this is classic
Miller. The plot is starkly different
— set in the future where the older
Batman comes out-zof retirement to

ﬁght once again. , '
“Batman: The  Halloween”
I The sequel to"“Year One,” “The

Long Halloween” by Jeph Loeb fur-
ther develops the comic’s villains and

heroes. The Batman and Catwoman1ove—hate
relationship is in full bloom at this point, and
the storyline will help readers get a jump on
understanding it in preparation for “The Dark
Knight Rises.” The book also features othervil—
lains like Poison Ivy and the Riddler. “The Long

Halloween” is well-known for containing the’

Harvey Dent/Two—Face origin story.

If you like “Batman: The Long Halloween,”I
also recommend “Hush.”]eph Loeb also penned
this comic, and it ﬁirthers Batman and Cat-
woman’s rocky love affair to its climax.

“Batman: The Killingjoke”

If you are in love with thejoker of “The Dark
Knight,” look no further than “'I‘he Killingjoke”
by Alan Moore.

9 It includes ﬂashbacks to the origins of the
Joker, but the villain himselfkeeps it a mystery
by saying, “If I’rn going tohave a past, I prefer
it to be multiple choice.” Now if that doesn’t
remind you of Heath Ledger’s portrayal, I’m
not sure what will. .

This graphic novel is pure genius — dark,
disturbing and psychologically complex, a style
for which comic master~author and epically
bearded Moore is legendary. The graphic novel’s
plot draws a parallel between the Joker and
Batman that questions the Dark Knight’s sanity
without providing a reassuring answer. “The
Killing Joke,” while short, is one of the most
inﬂuential series installments.

If you like “The Killingjoke,” I also recom-
mend “Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on
Serious Earth” by Grant Morrison. The Joker
—- in his insane element ——leads a takeover of
Arkham Asylum and holds its staff hostage in
this graphic novel.

 

.,_ 

3.

“Batman: Vengeance of Bane”

Tom Hardy is listed as playing the villain
Bane in “The Dark Knight Rises.” His character
is one of the more interesting villains.

“Vengeance of Bane” by Chuck Dixon ex-
plains the origins of the man. Bane is incredibly
smart and virtually unstoppable physically. He
was born in a prison and ‘is later used as a test
subject at that facility for a drug that he needs
to have pumped into his brain every 12 hours.
The complexities of the comic-book Bane and
how Nolan translates him into the “gritty real-
ism” of his trilogywill be intriguing to witness
on the big screen.

If you like “Batman: Vengeance of Bane,”
I also recommend the trilogy “Knightfall” by
various authors, which begins with anotherfun
Arkham related villain free-for—all and shows
the culmination of the Batman and Bane con-
flict..

it’s importantto rememberthat Batmanwas
born in the comic world before hewas a movie
star, and the world of comics is a strange and
fascinating.place. '

Every new author brings the possibility of a
new directionfor the storyline and characters,
and sometimes these can take place sirnultane—
ously. That tendency in comics, combined with
the multiple movie reboots, not to mention
cartoons andTVshows, makes for one confus-
ing bat—universe. '

For this reason, it’s helpful to begin with
graphic novels and compilations rather-than
individual comics when reading up on your
favorite mammal-themed vigilante, and keep
an open mind. No interpretation is more “right”
than any other, including the movies’. Happy
reading, bat-fans. I 

Alan Moore’s “The Killingjoke” is a graphic novel that presents uncomfortable
comparisons between Batman and the villainous Joker.

This year’s Three Rivers Arts Festival will
add 14 city blocks and a little more jazz to
the formula.

The jazz festival will be held in Pitts-
burgh’s Cultural District, between Tenth
and Stanwix streets, starting this weekend.
While the Three Rivers Arts Festival ex-
tends over a 10-day period, June 3-12, the
jazz festival will take place only during the
ﬁrst weekend of the arts festival, Friday
through Sunday. The half-century old arts
festival showcases art, music, dance, food
and theater in-Downtown each summer.

The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust an-
ticipates that the free jazz festival will -
generate exposure for Downtown Pitts-

, burgh, which includes six performance

theaters, multiple art galleries, restau-
rants and shops, said Veronica Corpuz,
spokeswoman for the Pittsburgh Cultural
Trust.“By having bookend events, there
will be a connectivity of performances, art
and fun throughout the entire 14 blocks of
the Cultural District,” Corpuz said.

Officials for the Pittsburgh _]azzLive
International festival hope that the es-
tablished tradition of the arts festival will
draw Pittsburghers to the new jazz por- 4
tion, Janis Burley Wilson, the director of
jazz programs forJazzLive International,
said.

Wilson began organizing the jazz festi-
val three years ago, thinking that “it might
be nice to expand the jazz program into a
festival of music.” The prospects of the j azz
festival have already grabbed international
attention in the magazines DownBeat and

Jazz Prime._ . ,

The Pittsburgh JazzLive International
festival will feature the talents of the Blind"
Boys of Alabama, Center of Life, Roger
Humphries, Sean Jones, Bettye LaVette,
Les Nubians, Gretchen Parlato, Gregory

Porter, Bobby Sanabria, Soulive with Nigel .

Hall, Tom Tom Club and local musician
Chelsea Baratz. Each performing group
features distinct elements to form a lineup

that Burley Wilson says will “provide a_

broad spectrum of what is jazz.”

On Friday,JazzLive will kick off with the
JazzLive crawl from 5:30-9 p.m. The crawl
will feature 20 different venues through-
out the Cultural District presenting live
jazz music.

~ I The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is also

hosting walking tours during the jazz
festival to familiarize attendees with the
galleries in the Cultural District and to
encourage families to return to the arts
festival throughout theweek.‘

Wilson hopes that the young and fresh
featured artists will get people interested
in the Pittsburgh jazz scene.

“After all,” she said, “Cleveland has a
Jazz Festival. Why shouldn’t we?”.

Local jazz musician Benny Benack III,
of Benny Benack III and Friends, is excited
to be a play trumpet during Friday’s jazz
crawl and thinks the line-up will show the
talent of Pittsburgh’s jazz scene.

“Pittsburgh’s jazz musicians are as good
as it gets anywhere in the world, and to

' have showcases for that talent like the '
.upcomingJazzLive International Festival

andjazz Crawl do wonders for keeping live
jazz music alive,” the Manhattan School
of Music junior said in an email. “There’s
nothing like live jazz.” I »

FILM REVIEW

Hand puppet stars  ‘Beaver’

Patrick Wagner
Stajfwri te‘r

“The Beaver”

Director: Jodie Foster

Staring: Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, Anton
Yelchin

Grade: B+

Mel Gibson is depressed and getting older,
with nowhere left to go .— at least that’s the
part he plays, in Jodie Foster’s extremely
dark comedy “The Beaver.” ‘ .
Gibson’s character, Walter Black‘, ﬁnds
solace in the form of a beaver hand puppet
with a British accent that he uses to separate
himself from the problems that affect his
personality. While Walter struggles against
depression with his furry friend, his teenage
son Porter (Anton Yelchin) struggles both
to win the affections of cheerleader Norah

(Jennifer Lawrence) — who has some unex-
pected qualities —- and to present the exact
opposite of his fathe_r’s sullen image. '
When The Beaver enters the family’s
life, it immediately seems to ﬁx numerous

FILM REVIEW

‘Kung Fu Panda 2’ goes deeper into
Po’s history, leaves room for more

Larissa Gula

“Kung Fu Panda 2”
Starring: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, An-
gelinajolie, Gary Oldman

Director: ]ennif'er_Yuh Nelson
Grade: A

A villainous peacock is out to take over China
and must be stopped by a band of epic kung
fu warriors — one of whom has a personal
connection with the terrifying enemy.

It sounds laughable, but Dreamworks
managed to convert this incredible concept
into a legitimately dramatic and tearfully
emotional plot in the making of “Kung Fu

Panda 2.” The animated action comedy might
now become a, six—part series as its success
continues. - ‘ ‘

Fans of the ﬁrst “Kung Fu Panda” should
remember how the adventure began: A panda
named Po (Jack Black) worked with his father
in a noodle shop while dreaming of being a

kung fu warrior ﬁghting alongside the Furi— »

Following his role in the last year’s thrill-

Pitt eliminated from Big East tournament

~ Kenny 0g I St hotgh

Pitt catcher Kevan Smith (No. 12) helped lead the Panthers to a 33-23 overall record and a No. 3 seed in the Big East tournament.

A Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Big East Championship

W hopes ended with a 12-2 loss to
‘ Louisville in the losers’ bracket,

and the senior—laden Panthers
didn’t receive an at—large bid to
the NCAA Tournament.

The Panthers ended the season
at 33-23, the team’s best regular

‘Ha’-1 season in six years, before moving

on to postseason play.

Pitt did win its ﬁrst game of the
tournament, defeating Louisville
7-2 in Clearwater, Fla.

Junior pitcher Matt Iannazzo

ﬂu threw a complete game to improve

S his record to 8-3 on the season,
and senior Sluggers Kevan Smith
and David Chester both belted
home runs as victory took the Pan-
thers into the winners’ bracket.

“In tournament play, you have

”>“”'to do everything possible to stay

out of the losers’ bracket,” head
coachjoejordano said in an email.
“We played a solid game against

Louisville.” ~

The Panthers moved on for a
matchup with the No. 2 seed and
defending champion St. John’s.
Despite the fact that the R_ed
Storm had already swept a three-
game series from Pitt earlier in the
season, the Panthers entered their
second game with conﬁdence.

“Even though they swept us, we
played them tough in those games,
and we knew we could beat them, if
we played our best game,” senior
Corey Baker, who took the mound
for Pitt‘ against St. John’s, said.

In a tight game throughout, the
St. John’s offense scored one run in
six different innings and heldoff
an eighth-inning Pitt rally. -

The Panthers almost tied the
game then, after scoring runs
off singles from Smith and Ches-
ter. But Smith was called out at
the plate when he attempted to
score on a wild pitch, ending the
inning. ’

The Red Storm added an insur-
ance run in the next inning, and
the Panthers dropped the hard-

‘ fought 6-4 decision.

“Game 2 against St. John’s was
a very tough loss,” Jordano said.
“We really played hard. We made
a couple of mistakes that cost us
and two critical calls went against

I us. Itjust‘didn’t go our way.”

In the ﬁfth inning, the Panthers
failed to turn a double play, allow-

3 ' ing the lead‘ runner to advance to

third and eventually score.”
The loss dropped Pitt into the

Z losers’ bracket, setting up another

game with Louisville.
“We have a team full of seniors
and knew thiswould be our last

game ifwe lost,” senior outﬁeld-

er Zach Duggan said. “It didn’t
matter who we were playing, we
wanted to leave everything on the
field.”

A In the second matchup be-
tween the two teams, Louisville’s
offensive explosion proved too

I much for the Panthers’ defense,

which has struggled at times this
year. I

The Cardinals struck early,
scoring two runs in the bottom

of the ﬁrst.

The Panthers cutthe lead in
half in the top of the second, but
Louisville pulled away with two
runs in the ﬁfth and" sixth in-
nings. , V

The Cardinals then sealed the
victory with a six-run eighth in-

ning, ending Pitt’s season with a-

12-2 loss.

The loss ended the careers of
the 11 seniors on Pitt’_s roster. The
seniors led the Panthers to three
consecutive years with 3o—plus
wins and four appearances in the
Big East Championships.

“We’ve done some really good

' things at Pitt, and I’m deﬁnitely

proud of these four years,” Baker
said. “Hopefully in the next cou-
ple years they’ can make the ﬁrst
NCAA Tournament for Pitt.”

Fellow senior Duggan said that
Pitt has a winning program.

“I really like everything coach '

Jordano has done, and with the
new ﬁeld and new recruits, this
program can continue- to get bet-

. ter,”.he said. I

   

.G_¢ﬂL|\L|_|!
Mavs,
Heat get
rematch

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

I was hoping that the Miami Heat
wouldn’t get this far. i

As soon as LeBronJames ﬁnished
“The Decision” special on ESPN in
July, I started hoping that a clash
of egos between James, Dwyane
Wade and Chris Bosh would lead
to an underachieving season of epic
proportions forthe teamfrom South
Beach.

For a while, it did look like the
Heat were going to struggle. But
then they caught ﬁre — no-pun
intended.

So now the NBA Finals are set
to begin.between the-Miami Heat

and the Dallas Mavericks. There’s ‘

noquestion who I’m going to be
pulling for. .

My preference for the Maver-
icks doesn’t even completely stem
from howjames acted when he left
Cleveland.

My disdain for the Heat doesn’t
end with the image ofjames, Wade

-and Bosh prancing around on stage

in their uniforms with ﬁreworks go-
ing off around them before the sea-
son even started -— although that
deﬁnitely didn’t help.

One of the main reasons rm
pulling for the Dallas Mavericks
goes back to the 2006 NBAsFinals
against the Heat. This was when

James was still with the Cavaliers,

and Cleveland had a sports team to
care about. ‘ ‘ V

The Mavs hada 2-0 serieslead
over the Heat after winning the ﬁrst

games by double digits. It looked ,

like Dallas was going to run away
with the. cha1npi‘onship.,Then sud-
denly, the referees decided to make
the foul line Wade’s new_ home.

Wade’ shot a record number
of free throws over the next four
games, averaging about 25 per game,
as the Heat went on awinning streak
to take the championship. Needless
to say, passionate Mavericks owner
Mark Cuban wasn’t pleased. p

In fact, he was ﬁned $250,000
after Game Five for charging onto

Mavs.) 13

TENNIS

Young Panthers look to improve

Nate Barnes
Staﬂ" Writer

While falling short ofboth awinning
season and a berth in the Big East
Tournament, the Pitt women’s tennis
team managed to ﬁll the record books
with individual achievements. .

The team ﬁnished 8-12 (2-7 Big
East), with its ﬁrst losing record in
six seasons. The last time the Pan-
thers ﬁnished with a losing record
was 2005, with a mark of 9-11.The
disappointing year has returning

players focused on improving their .

individual games in order to help the
team rise in the Big East standings.

“I had a lot of close matches last .

year that I lost in the third set, and
I’m really working on improving cer-
tain elements of my game to help me
winthose,” rising sophomore Kimmy -
Borza said. “I’m focused on improv-
ing my serve and getting as much
time in on the courtwith some team-
mates as possible.”

The Panthers earned the No. 10
seed in the Big East Championships
in 2010 and the No. 8 seed in 2009.
But this season, Pitt’s youth and an
injury to 2011 graduate Elizabeth
Adams contributed to keeping the
Panthers from  one of the 12
seeds in the bracket.

But Pitt returns ﬁve of six start-
ers next season, including rising
sophomores Borza and Jocelyn Lu,
doubles -partners who tallied 25 and
32 overall victories, respectively. Ad-
ams envisions a bright ﬁxture for next
year’s team as the athletes continue
to progress. ,

“This is still a very young team,
there were a lot of freshmen,” Adams

said. “They all have a lot of room to a

grow and develop, and I know they
will do verywell. Iwish them the best
of luck going forwar .”

Adams assumed her place in the
record books by reaching second
place in all-time victories among

_ Panther tennis players with 138.

With seven singles wins and 10 in
doubles, Adamsjumped three former
Pitt players in the record books to
take hold of second place.

“We did well for our age. We were
avery young team,” Adams said. “We
didn’t do as well as we hoped, but
this year was great for the younger
girls. They got a lot of playing time

and experience.”

Adams entered the season with
122 career victories, trailing Carlie
Smith (135 wins), Annie Davies (126)
and Fran Davis (124), whose records
she later surpassed, as well as Pitt
all-time win record holder Kristy
Borza. . ‘

Unfortunately for Adams,-her
season was slightly derailed by
multiple injuries, most notably to_

’ her shoulder. Although she missed

only four matches total, she did not
participate in a number of singles
contests after playing doubles with
her partner Gabrielle Catanzariti.

While Adams was injured, rising
junior Catanzariti stepped into the
No. 1 spot. She won 21 matches —
third on the team — with nine wins
in singles and 12in doubles.

Adams still managed 17 victories
overall, which put her four-year total

. in second place behind that of Kristy
Z Borza,acurrentassistantcoachwho

still has the most all-time team wins
with 176. ,

The only key loss for the Panthers
this season, Adams provided much of
the experience on the Pitt squad and
her injury accounted for some of the
Panthers’ struggles as the relatively
inexperienced group attempted to
navigate the Big East.

The team was made up of three
seniors, two juniors, three sopho-

mores and four freshmen. Seniors
AdelaAprodu and Sarah Dieffenbach
ﬁnishedstheir careers with 44 and
four career wins, respectively. Adela
played in three singles matches last
season, and Dieffenbach played in
none. A

Withlzwinsinsingles playand13
in doubles, Borza posted the second-
highest season victory total of any-
one on the team. Lu brought back 20
singles wins and 12 indoubles play, to
lead the team in each category. '

The duo of Borza-and Lu com-
bined to post more than one—third
of the team’s entire win tally with 57
victories of the team’s total 154.

“It was exciting to rack up some
wins this year,” Lu said. “I just fo-
cused on going out and playing my
best and having ﬁm.”

Despite not making the Big East
Championships, the team did man-
age to hit several memorable mile-

' stones. Head coach George Dieffen-

bach recorded his 300th victory as
coach of me Pitt tennis team.
Brittney Russell and TaylorWash-

i ington, both rising sophomores, won

14 and 10 matches respectively.

With Borza, Lu, Russell and Wash-
ington, Pitt has a core of four young
players to rely on over the next three
seasons. The group ﬁnished with 81
of the team’s 154 victories.

Heading into this season, Lu said
she wants to improve her focus.

“I need to  not worry about los-
ing previous games or points, but to
really have a handle on the moment,”
Lu said. “As a team, we needed to
work hard for every point and work
on not giving any free points away to
our opponents.”

Rising senior Minh Evans and
rising junior Karma Parbhu also
contributed to the team’s efforts this
year, postingwin totals of 15 and 18,
respectively. .

the court to yell at the referees and
later using profanity during inter-
views.

Despite Cuban’s outburst, ref-
eree Danny Crawford and the crew
continued blatantly to protect Wade,
and, as a result, the Heat hoisted the
trophy at the end of that season.

Even if James and Bosh hadn’t
joined the Heat and even if James
hadn’t announced his decision in
over-the-top fashion on national
television, I’d still be pulling for the

Dirk Nowitzki:

who I’d love to see ﬁnally get one. '*'

One of the main differences be-
tween Nowitzki andjames? Nowit-
zki chose to stay. James promised
Cleveland a championship, then
bolted as soon as it got too tough
in order to join two other superstars;
in Miami.

Not only did he leave, he told the
world he was leaving in dramatic
fashion on ESPN. Sorry LeBron,
nobody is that important.

Nowitzki, on the other hand,

I’m trying to win it for this
organization, for the owner, 
for myself and for the team.

Mavs to get their revenge.

I might be pulling for the Mavs
anyway. I love Cuban. I think he’s a
fantastic owner. Every day I wake up
hoping he’ll buy the Pirates.

He says what he thinks although
it often leads to a ﬁne. He’s been
ﬁned 16 times in 12 years. But the
thing about_Cuban is that you can
tell that he cares. He’s visible and
ﬁery, and he sticks up for his team.

There is no doubt that Cuban
loves the Mavericks and the game
of basketball. Some people say he’s
as easy to hate asJames, but I dis-
agree. At least Cuban is loyaL

. Plus, he was born in Pittsburgh
and attended Pitt for one year. So
if you’re in Pittsburgh looking for a
rooting interest in the NBA Finals,
there you go.

Then there’s the Mavericks’ Dirk
Nowitzki, one of the greatestplayers
in the game today. Like James, he
doesn’t have an NBA Championship.
Unlike James, he’s a likable player

stayed with the Mavs despite the
fact that the Lakers and the Spurs
in the West repeatedly defeated
them. While James spends a lot of
time talking about himself, Nowitzki
tends to focus on the team.

“I’m not really worried about all
that [my legacy] ,” he told The New
York Times. “I’m trying to be on the
best team. I’m trying to win it foiu
this organization, for the owner, for
myself and for the team.”

There’s no player I’ve enjoyed
watching in the NBA playoffs more
than Nowitzki. His jump shot is a
beautiful thing.

It will also be a beautiful thing if
the Mavericks take this series from
the Heat.

Not onlywill the Mavericks earn
redemption for the 2006 loss to the
Heat and the referees, butjames and
his teammates won’t have a reasaiif
to get up on a stage in Miami again
— although they didn’t really need
a reason last time. ' |
