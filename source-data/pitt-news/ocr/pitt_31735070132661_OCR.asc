tudents open about Islam at MSA’s, open house

ANDY MEDICI
Staff Writer

In Islam, serving one’s parents is a duty
second only to worshipping, and it is the
parents’ right to expect such service.

Aisha Qureshi, a junior at Pitt, plans to
have her parents live with her in their old
age, and she has never thought about putting
them in a nursing home.

“It is something we can do to pay them
back for raising us,” Qure_shi said. “To give
them the same respect and love as they gave
us when we were younger.” ‘

house on Islam, hosted by the Muslim
Student Association.
V Janrila Marr, a junior and president of

the MSA, said the main reason for the event -

was to educate people about Islam and dis-

pel stereotypes associatedwith Muslims.
“We did this because we noticed mas-

sive discrimination and misunderstandings

on campus —- that women are oppressed, _

and that we are all terrorists — especially
after Sept. 11, 2001,” Marr said.

Marr also gave her opinion on the
Israeli and Palestinian conﬂict.

“I don’t agree with the occupation. If

. According to one of the posters at the
open house, Islam only permits ﬁghting in
self-defense, in defense of religion, or on
behalf of those who have been forcibly
expelled from their homes.

Marr also attacked the idea of the
Muslim women are oppressed through the

» clothes they wear.

. “Her physical beauty is notimportant.
It is her mental beauty,” Marr said. “So, in

the corporate world, you can get the job you ~

want because you are smart, not because
you look good in a miniskirt.”

Just like any other students at Pitt,

Student Government Board members are

lool<ing.forward to summer.

“To all those people who. think. their I

professors are Satan incarnate, summer is
almost here,” SGB member Charis Jones
said

some 'of the confusion ‘ and humor that
occurred during the meeting.

“I assure you, this is not our ﬁrst board
meeting,” said Moms, who also joked about

his age. “Yes, I am 29 years old, for those of 1

you who ask .”

The meeting provided an opportunity
for the board to recognize the works of peo-
ple and organizations on campus.

Jones spoke about the Pitt Project
Oakland, which organizes events for stu-
dents to help clean up the area.

“It is pretty cool, and it’s outside,” Jones
said. ‘

SGB President Brian Kelly also recog-
nized Students for Political Opportunity, for
their efforts in bringing politicians like John

Kerry and Pennsylvania Governor Ed

Rendell to campus. _
“They have been really integral in

 [Kerry and Rendell] to campus,” »

Kelly said.

Kelly also responded to Morris’ request
that SGB vote to add the membership fee for
United States Student Association, without
sending the application through the alloca-
tions committee. 4

‘”That’s not a precedent we want to set,”
Kelly said.

The board agreed to vote on a resolu-
tion dealing with the issue during its next
meeting.

Free food, meetings fill a day for Brian Kelly

ANASTASIA STERANKO
Staff Writer

He’s big. He’s bad. He’s the Student

Govemment Board president.

Two Pitt News writers spent time tag-
ging along with Brian Kelly on March 26,
to ﬁnd out what the big man on campus
does all day. We started our day with
Kelly at 8:15 a.m., when he briskly strode
into SGB headquarters on the 6th ﬂoor of
the William Pitt Union. Kelly apologized
for being late, as he was up late studying
and he slept through his alarm.

An SGB planning session occupied
the ﬁrst place on the agenda. Sitting at the

head of a rectangular table, Kelly listened
to the opinions of the board as they dis-
cussed current issues. The debate became
rather heated when members began dis-
cussing controversial topics, such as the
decision to cut some funding for the
United States Student Association.

Tensions lightened when the board
began talking about getting free food for
later in the day.

At 10:01 a.m., we escorted Kelly

. back to his office. Kelly informed The Pitt

News that a former SGB president once
proposed getting the Pitt emblem imposed
on the rug of the SGB office, in a style
similar to the President’s seal in the Oval

Office.

The request was rejected.

Though small, Kelly’s office is
impressively equipped, complete with a
stereo, which Kelly makes use of during
his down time.

After an hour of discussing Kelly’s-

past involvement in student groups like
the Blue and Gold Society, we followed
Kelly to his favorite class: Portuguese, at
11:00 a.m. Ana Paula Carvalho, his pro-
fessor for the class, is Kelly’s favorite
teacher -—'he waited until second semes-
ter to take Portuguese 2 so that he could be
in her class.

Instructed to complete an exercise,
Kelly opened his book.

“I want to_go to Brazil,” he said,
pointing to a picture of a magniﬁcent
mountainside in his book.‘ A

After class, Kelly and The Pitt News
writers were famished. Luckily, we were

» scheduled for a free lunch in the WPU

Ballroom that featured diverse food from
local restaurants. The lunch was held in
celebration of Diversity Week. Kelly put
his size XXL Diversity T-shirt on over his
button-up shirt before digginginto the
free food. LI

As weate our international cuisine,
Ke1ly’s intern, Rebekah Bambling, dis-
cussed her internship. ' -

“Who better than SGB president to
intern with?” Bambling asked, explaining
that she helps keep Kelly organized‘.

“He really lacks organizational
skills,” she said. Kelly did not deny the
usefulness of her assistance. »

“My office is really messy,” he admit-
ted. T

But Bambling didn’t place all the

A blame on Kelly.

“He just doesn’t have time for all of
it,” she said. ‘ P ’

After lunch, we stopped by the Pitt
Program Council art show in the Union to

visit Mike Kelly, Brian Kel1y’s old room-
‘ mate. The two are not related. A

“He’s a lot of fun to live with,” Mike
Kelly said. “We always had fun. There

It’s not easy to eat 60 ounces of rice,
beans, chicken and cheese as quickly as
possible.

But that’s what Qdoba Mexican Grill
called on brave contestants to do in the sec-
ond annual Qdoba burrito-eating contest,
held Saturday in the restaurant located on
Forbes Avenue in Oakland.

Winners had to eat three burritos as
quickly as possible, using only their hands,
without throwing up or making a trip to the
bathroom.

“Let’s hope there’s not much hurling

this year,” said Qdoba owner and operator ,

Chad Brooks, balancing his young son,
Sam, on his shoulder. Brooks stood in front
of the counter and supervised the making of
the burritos, which were soon to be gobbled
up by the 18 participants in the competition.

An assembly line of Qdoba employees .

quickly compiled the burritos, putting an
assortment of salsas on each burrito. Each
contestant had to consume a burrito with
mild, hot and extra hot salsa to win.

Meanwhile, the contestants sat at the
square,‘ steel tables, sipping water out of
small plastic cups and seeming surprisingly
conﬁdent.

“My whole life has been in preparation

on Pitt senior Sam Audia as he chews his way to victory in

THE PITT NEWS

Students rely on rice, gluttony,
drugs to be burrito champions

for this,” explained 25 -year-old~J on Scott of
Squirrel Hill. Scott said he had not done
anything in particular to prepare for his bur-
rito eating competitive debut.

Another man at the table had indeed
done a little something to help him get his
munch on.

“I smoked some pot right before I
came down here,” he said, smiling gleeful-

ly, with strangely blood-shot eyes.

The contestants at the next table took
more serious preparatory action. But previ-
ous Qdoba burrito eating title-holder,
Ashley Wmgert, left his burrito-eating
preparations for this year’s contest undis-
closed. ,» ‘

“It’s a training secret,” he said slyly,
adding that he did not want anyone to know
because they might use his secret to out-eat
 Last year, Wingert ate several cups of
rice each day to prepare himself for th
contest and subsequent victory. '

Another tablemate used the theory of
sheer gluttony to prepare for ‘the touma-
ment. \ , \

' “I [had] like ﬁve oranges, two liters of
water and a half—pound of potatoes last
night,” Carnegie Mellon University senior
Chris Murtland explained.

Employees ﬁnished piling the meat,

having multiple wives in Islam.

“You can have up to four, but it is best
to have only one. You are only allowed to
marry a second wife if the ﬁrst one agrees,”
Boumaza said.

Hami Ramani, a sophomore at Pitt and
a self-described atheist, attended the open
house to talk with others and learn more
about Islam.

“It’s important to expose yourself to
different things,” said Rarnani, who dis-
cussed how religion can cause animosity

among people. He added that the messages
conveyed by religions reach beyond con-
ﬂicts.

, “The message of Islam is beautiful, just
like Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and
others,” Rarnani said.

Irnan Moawad, a sophomore at Pitt and
secretary of the group, stressed that Islam is
non-violent, and that there would be less
violence if people were better educated.

“I think that so much of the violence
that happens is because of ignorance,”
Moawad said. “By doing this, we can make
a more peaceful and understanding world.”

Kelly gets just

next year. Tired of the perpetual smell of
beer in South Oakland, Kelly said he was
contemplating the beneﬁts of living
across the river. After all, he does have his
own free parking space on campus.

When he returned from apartment
shopping, Kelly ﬁelded more questions
from The Pitt News. We asked Kelly who
he would most want to see featured in
another “A Day in the Life of” article.

After much consideration, Kelly
answered, “J aron Brown.”

The Pitt News spent time getting to
know more about what it’s like to be the
SGB president.

“I have time,” said Kelly. “It’s not
like there is always something going on. I
still go out a lot.”

Kelly encouraged students to become,

more involved in student government.
“There is nothing that makes me
[happier] than [when] »a person who has
never gotten involved, comes up and gets
involved.” H A
‘ “I don’t think students realize we
have power,” he added.» “We have money.
We have [about] $800,000.”

“When you’re in class 15 hours a
‘week, you still have 25 extra hours. It’s
not like college kids do 25 hours worth of
homework.” Kelly said, responding to the

, common excuse of lack of time "that many
students give. , " »

Kelly told The Pitt News that he has
met a lot of people through his experi-
ences with studentinvolvement.

“I .walk around campus and I feel like
I’m in my house,”,.he said. '

At 7:00 p.m., Kelly attended a Greek
Week meeting for Greek Sing. In addition
to his involvement with SGB, Kelly is
also a Lambda Chi Alpha brother.

But the meeting did not mark the end

_ of Kelly’s day. After the meeting, Kelly

cleaned up with more free food at a dinner
.welcoming the _ Declaration of
Independence to campus.
After eenjoying coconut-covered
shrimp and gourmet desserts, Kelly was
prepared to end his day with an alloca-

tions meeting. Wrapping up after rnid- V

night, Kelly was ﬁnally ready to go to
sleep, sq he could be prepared for another
day. t _

Victor eats quick 60 ounces of burrito

Burritos, page 3

cheese, rice and beans into soft shells,
wrapped each burrito in foil, and dropped
them into paper bags.

Brooks, speaking to the contestants
and the small crowd gathered to watch the
competitive chomping, announced that the
three burritos totaled about 60 ounces of
burrito. 7

“Anybody want to feel the weight?” he
asked, dropping a bag into a participant’s
hand. The contender looked stunned by the
sheer mass of the burritos, as her hand
dropped several inches before grasping the
bag tightly.

One contestant mentioned how the
burritos didn’t look quite as menacing
when they were tucked neatly in the white
Qdoba-logoed paper bags.

Scott, in anticipation, yelled to an
employee to join him in-eating the burritos.

' “I can’t even handle half of one,” she
responded, laughing. ‘.‘There’s no ‘way in
he .” '

Once the burritos had been passed out
and contestants had arranged them in an
appropriate eating order, the biting, slurp-
ing, chomping and regurgitating began.

. _ 6 The majority of contestants ate the bur-
ritos at a moderate pace, sipping water and
trying to gain composure every few bites.

Wmgen, on the other hand, had a
unique burrito-eating technique. He began
by eating the soft shells of each burrito, and

then inhaled the insides. Rice and beans
were smeared across his face as he held up
the tinfoil burrito wrapper and lapped up
the contents.

Murtland’s binge fest was not enough
for him to get his three burritos down. He
began the competition by sucking and
slurping, but soon his head was in the
garbage -‘can, and he was burping and barf-
mg.

Unfortunately, regurgitation or trips to
the bathroom meant instant disqualiﬁca-
tion, and thus Murtland could not ﬁnish his
bunito binge.

While Wmgert was eating his burritos
in a dog-like fashion, Pitt senior Sam Audia
kept his burritos intact, and was coming up
ahead of Wmgert. Audia reached his third
while Wmgert was still slurping up a mas-
sive pile of burrito innards.

“I think he has an abnormally large
stomach,” a companion of Audia’s com-
mented, as he’ watched his friend inhale his
third and ﬁnal burrito. A

The crowd cheered, and nine minutes
after the eating begun, Audia took his ﬁnal
bite, stood up, looked at. his friends, and
made an inquiry.

“Dessert?” he asked.

Brooks went to congratulate his new
burrito-eating ﬁend and present him with a
cash prize and an Oakland Zoo T-shirt.
Other eaters still feasted on the burritos,

$100, so that was cool,” Audia said, clasp-
ing the fresh bills in his hands. ,

Wmgert, obviously upset with the loss
of his title, continued to consume the burri- A
tos.

“There’s a t-shirt to be won,” he
explained, slurping more rice and beans.

Contestants Paul Buyanovsky, a CMU
sophomore, and Lucy Lascelles, of
London, munched slowly on their burritos
even after Audia had taken the title.

Lascelles, perplexed by the American‘
pleasure in competitive food consumption,
admitted that it gave her insight into the
culture.

“It was a_ liberating “experience,” she
said. .“I thought we should have been able
to use knives and forks, though.”

Lascelles was the only female partici-,
pant in the burrito-eating contest this year.

A call for financial transparencytfrom Pitt

The Petersen Events Center is ‘a
beautiful, modern facility. It’s a stu-
dent hub, makes a great picture for
brochures and"is a hell of a basketball
arena.

Consequently, it cost a lot of
money to build. That shouldn’t come
as a surprise-to anyone. As with most
construction projects, too, final costs
were far higher than initial estimates.

At first, the projected cost of the
building was $35 million. The final
figure was $119 million — more than
triple the estimate. Taxpayers’ contri-
butions wound up totaling $66 mil-
lion," after Pitt said it would take no
more than $13 million in public
funds.

Building projects are known for
running over budget and longer than
expected. When that happens, it can
be a public relations nightmare, but it
is incumbent upon the entity spend-
ing the public’s money — Pitt, in this
case —- to be forthright" about it. In
terms of public relations, it is poor
form to miss a chance to apply spin to
information. And it is always poor
form to conceal important informa-
tion. i

Neither Pitt nor the state was
willing to «admit to these increases,
despite official documents, uncov-
ered by reporters from the Post-
Gazette, indicating both knew when

construction" began in June 2000 that
the cost would be much higher than
estimated. ‘ A
The Pete is an investment inthe
university, the region and the state. It
is useful for basketball recruiting, as
well as for bringing big-name musi-

cal acts to perform in Oakland. It is a .

big expenditure for certain «interests,
with rewards. As such, those interests
deserve to know where their money is
going.

If more is needed for justifiable
expenses, Pitt needs to say so, and to
say why, and then to make the needed
adjustments in funding. While there
would have certainly been an outcry
at Pitt grabbing for more money, it
would have been aboveboard, and
thus far more honorable than the cur-
rent scenario. v

In light of the cost .more than

tripling -—— which is unrealistic, even‘

in terms of expected cost increases —
it seems Pitt was not in touch with
reality from the outset. If it was an
honest mistake, however, Pitt should
have proceeded as though it had noth-
ing to fear, instead of hiding known
financial problems.

It is embarrassing for Pitt stu-
dents —- living, breathing symbols of
the institution — to be enjoying the
products of a university with such a
credibility problem. i I '

It was aully-fun giving yinz advice n’at

Dear Sex N’At‘ Readers:

You hold in your hands my ﬁnal
effort as sex columnist for The Pitt
News. Don’t worry, it’s not going to be
a weepy, “I’m going to miss college so
much, but real world, here I
come!” kind of column —
that’ s next week, when Irun
my ﬁnal-ever Pitt News col-
umn, for which I reserve the
right to be maudlin, weepy
and pseudo—philosophical.

This week, I’m just
going to address the unbe-
lievable amount of fun I’ve

had having the honor of ' Melissa Meinzer
' Opinions Editor

being your go-to gal. I’ve
been recognized out more
than I ever thought possible.
I’ve dealt Texas Hold ‘Em poker in a

dress I never thought would. see the out—-

side of my closet. I got to autograph an
engineer’s Wang in the back of a crowd-
ed bar, for god’s sake! '

1 I get creepy come—ons ahnost every -

day. I hear details of the sex lives of
strangers -——.in all honesty, one of the
best and weirdest parts of the job. My
parents  oy  my poor parents. My
parents probably know or can infer

-more about me than I would ever tell

them without the relative impersonality

that print and 300 miles affords me.
There is a lot of truth in this kind of

writing, and that can be good or bad.

' Advice writing can take two tacks +-

either from first-person experience, or a
more general approach. I decided early
on that the literal details of my own life
between the sheets would never directly
make it into the paper. I’m the one that

signed up for this gig, and not anyone '

else, no matter how close they are to me.
. But I’m sure Ijtested the patience of
some wonderful people‘ in my life —

Fabio, you were and are amazing, above ~

reproach, and you put up with a lot of
crap; and Stork, you let me put parts of

 

 

your life. on the dissecting table that
happened when we were just kids, after
all. Thanks, lads.

I’ve gotten lots of hate mail from
Christians and moral authorities, andthe
disdain of a lot of folks who miss my
cute little columns about
rats and defrosting my

6 borhood spies that my par-
ents don’t brag about what
I’m up to nearly as much.

I honestly rankle some-

that sex is all I know, and is
all I do here at The Pitt
News. This column, while
the most visible thing I do at
the paper, is the one that
takes up the least amount of

my time and energy. I earned my job as '

opinions editor through blood, sweat
and journalism. Sex N’At just sort of
fell into my lap, where it proceeded to
wriggle and misb_ehave and  yeah.

I have loved my time inthis job. I
loved getting e-mails that were obvious-
ly written by inebriated folks. The pub-
licity has been nice, and the advice and
criticism from fake Hotmail accounts
has been hilarious, especially when
attempted anonymity on the part of a
questioner has failed miserably. I think
the column has been a success, and I
hope you enjoyediit half as much as I
did. I leave you in very capable hands
— next year will see two sex columnists
at The Pitt News, so every question can
be athreesome. . I

Don’t let my cappuccino fool you; I’m no liberal bastard

I became a columnist for a few reasons. First excusive justification.

of all, I wanted to educate everyone about impor-
tant issues such as peeing, boogers, '
how much Canadian beer sucks and
how much I hate it when people
steal my seat. Secondly, I wanted to
do so in an entertaining manner.
Any time I can provide a funny
story about dead hookers or how I
turn women into lesbians, I try to
use those stories to make the learn-
ing experience of reading my
columns more fun.

However, every now and then, I —
fall behind on the current events
involving poop, and have nothing _
fun to write about. That’.s the situation I’m in right
now. So, I apologize for the seriousness of what
you are about to read —— or throw it aside like my
mother does with everything I write to her.

Now, what’s really been bothering me is
something that happened to me the other day. I
found myself eating a blueberry bagel with a
hazelnut cappuccino while reading Descartes.
While I have an explanation for all this —
Einstein’s ran out of chocolate chip bagels, I did-
n’t know what a cappuccino was and I had to
study — I fear that my explanation is just an

 

Christian Brubaker

Columnist

Some people probably see no problem with
what I was doing — plenty of people
have done similar things. While I am well
aware of that, I am also aware that the
only men who would do this are either
gay or liberal ——not that there is anything
wrong with homosexuality. But I like
boobs way too much to be gay. I

Which leads me to a scary thought:
What if I’m one of those liberal bastards
I hate so much?

While I’m not the most conserva-
tive person, liberal whining pisses me off
more than it pisses off most others. I

- ' agree with some liberal viewpoints, but it
scares me to think that I might be one of those
idiots who oppose everything Republicans do just
so I can fulfill some need to think of myself as
someone who has a cause for which to fight. I’m
worried that the disease of liberalism is taking
over my head. If it is, it will only be a matter of
time before I’m’c1assi_fied as stupid.

Then I could join theranks of those who feel
it essential that they must always be bitching
about some aspect of 'America’s foreign policies.

My response has always been that if America is]

bad enough to warrant constant criticism, then get

the hell out. Go live in France, eat cheese and
walk around with your arms up, waving white
ﬂags. Or, for those who protested the war in Iraq:

Go try living in an oppressed country where your .

constant bitching about the government is punish-
able by death. V

Perhaps then, some of you would realize that
while you consider yourselves to be so freaking
“open-minded,” you’re actually ‘very limited in

your capacity to understand how‘ things operate 4

outside of the perfect, magical land you "created in
your heads. Maybe some of you would also.real-
ize that you and your hippie friends can’t out-
smart the entire U.S. government between bong
hits.

I’m glad that peoplemﬁse their freedom of
speech. It makes me glad to know that I live in a
country where people are free to have varying
viewpoints that they can express. I just get tired
of opening newspapers and reading about what
Johnny, Billy, and Suzy think sucks about the
United States. The United States is the best damn

~ country there will ever be. I just wanted to say

that now, before that liberal disease spreads and
makes me become one of those people who don’t
understand the greatness of this country.

E—mail Christian Brubaker at cdb24@pitt.edu.

One of the few things that I dis-

teeth, in bed by 11, eat your veggies, quences. Could it be that the music

.What’s more worthy of a song, partying naked or being truly happy?

is necessary to discard the past.

like about music and quotations is
the vast array of different signals
that they send. Our radios may serve
as the Greek chorus of our daily
lives, yet it’s hard to gain much
sense of direction on certain matters
when I can go from hearing “don’t
go for the one you‘ can love, go for
the one you can’t live without” to “if
you really love something, you
won’t fight if it wants to be let free.”

Either philosophy sounds pretty
facile to me. So where does that
leave me? Confused. As John
Cusack pondered in “High Fidelity,”
“Do I listen to pop music because
I’m miserable? Or am I miserable
because I listen to pop music?”
Every song I come across seems to
pinpoint exactly all the things I find
wrong with me ('let’s face it, John
Mayer’s lyrics are going to survive
the test of time; he’s simply explor-
ing the rite of passage that is not
being appreciated in his own time -
not without glib remarks of disdain,
anyway). .

There is, however, one point on
which it seems all of the music
world has joined in unison over —
that living a “full life” basically
amounts to being as reckless and
free (or uncaring) of responsibility
as possible.

Think about it. When’s the last

time you heard anybody croon some-«

thing along the vein of “brush your

-.,..» —, ’‘,VV - .—,--,-.1-«»_j._,- -- ..~.,...v-.—‘..-cu»- 7*‘ ... . ... ..,._,_.. ..

on your way to heaven” outside of a
lullaby? The only
instances in which the
virtues of a responsible 9-
5 existence are extolled is
when used to ironic
effect, sneering down on
such practices as the mark
of society’s prisoners, a
classic Radiohead staple.

It’s simply just not as
sexy to promote a bal-
anced lifestyle when
matched up against every
“party naked” anthem out
there. This could simply be because
it’s a hell of a lot easier to do for free
abandonment, but there is still some-
thing misguided about the 20-some-
thing who proudly proclaims he’/is
defined by his culture, adorned in a
Bob Marley T-shirt and bobbing to
Blink on their headsets — en route to
a calc recitation from a Young
Republicans meeting. Or the friend
with “live like there’s no tomorrow”
as their AOL instant messenger info
— with an away message reading
“studying for the next six hours,
blech”.

I could just be reading too much
into this. After all, mild—mannered
folks ﬂock to action movies simply
because of how detached the world

presented is — it’s a chance to vicar-

iously live through someone else

without suffering any of the conse-

“Is this the story of Johnny Rotten? ’i" _
-Neil Young, “Hey Hey, My My”

MONDAY, APRIL 12, 2004

CHRISTINE CLAUS
’ Staff Writer

“Hello? ... Hello? Anyone there?”

“Yes, Johnny.” ~

No, it’s not the familiar Charlie calling
in to speak to his Angels; it’s Johnny Rotten
callin’ in to shout out to his fellow college
partiers.

And where is Johnny? .

Chillin’ on the beach in Cancun, »
Mexico sipping on a Margarita — that’s
where.

J.R. makes occasional calls from the
beach to his newly opened Oakland joint.
J.R. will ask those in charge to offer free
drinks, Mardi  beads or cash giveaways
to students who can answer random trivia
questions. ‘ -

Located in ‘the heart of Oakland on
Forbes Avenue, Johnny Rotten’s is the “l8-
and-over college joint your mother warned
you about,” as their slogan says.

. The concept of Johnny Rotten’s origi-
nated from Gus Grekis’ college experiences.

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

Adifferent environment for stents

Despite being one of the biggest college
partiers at UCLA, WVU and Pitt, he noticed
something missing from each college cam-
pus experience.

“Often when I was in college we’d get
a group of people together and either wound
up going to a dirty house party or up on the
hill [at the fraternity houses], but there was-
n’t a place where friends - both under 21
and over 21 — can get together to socialize
and hang out,” Grekis said. “Johnny
Rotten’s' oifers just that.” .

The “joint” is funded by Diversiﬁed

Night Clubs of America, of which Grekis is‘

an OW1'lCI'.

“We have a few other 18-and-over’

places to give college students a chanceiﬂto

hang out somewhere other than an apart-

ment or house party,” said Bernie Firman,

director of operations for Johnny Rotten’s.
Open every Thursday, Friday and

Saturday from 9 p.m. to 2 am., J .R.’s offers

free soda and'$1 hot dogs steamed in beer.
A hot dog for a dollar, who does that?
Johnny does, of course.

over college "students at the entrance to Johnny Rotten’s.

“We do also offer free beer for those with a
valid over-21 I.D., but they must have a
valid college I.D. as well, to keep in strictly
a college crowd,” Firman» added.

So, how much does it cost to get into
this college-only, free beer-offering (E of
legal age) establishment? ’

Well, if you’re over 21, it’s free — no
matter your sex.

Under 21? Then you’ll have to pay a $7

A cover — except on Thursday nights when it’s

only a $3 cover for females, because it’s
ladies’-night. .

Don’t like to dance, but still want free
beer and a chance to meet someone new?
J.R.’s also has video games, sports trivia,
darts and Mega Touch machines, as well as
a quieter room to just stand around and talk
to friends. '

And there7s no DJ. needed here.

J .R.’s offers a computerized music sys-
tem free from turntables with pulsating
sounds bumping out of large speakers on
every wall. Techno beats keep dancers’
hearts pumping all night.

“We made it up really nice, so it’s not a
typical college dump,” Firman said. “Most
college bars just want to take the college
kids’ money, but we’re offering students the
chance to relax, party and socialize in a
secure environment.”

With ﬁve largely built security men and
two Pittsburgh police SWAT oﬂicers at the
door, they are hoping to “provide a safe and
fun atmosphere for the under-21 college
crowd, while allowing those older than 21 to
drink free beer in a sectioned—off room with
a strict doorman,” Firman said.

“Our security staff plays a very active
role in the night’s events,” Grekis added.

Johnny Rotten greets incoming visitors to
his joint. In the entranceway, neon lights
blink off the almost too-shiny silver wrap-
ping over the front doors. The front of the
joint has large glass windows that are cur-
rently covered with eye—catching and very

“It’s a service we’d like to offer students in
thanks for them coming here.”

Grekis explains how they hope to work
with the university as much as possible in
terms of student organizations to raise fund-
ing and boost enrollment in various student
groups.

Maldoror takes listeners on a musical journey

I Ma/doror

Erik Friedlander

Brassland Records

ﬁtsksk

Recommended if you like:
Experimentalist or concept
albums, Harry Partch, Laurie
Anderson, Philip Glass

Classical music is great. The best
part of it is the amount of work put
into creating scores. When I think of

21st century composers, I almost

expect painstakingly engineered
works of art. There’s so much to con-
sider when writing music — time
signatures, key signatures, writing
for other instruments, rests, etc.

Here we have an album that fea-
tures a cello. Maladoror is a solo
work of improvisation, so toss all of
that previous theory out the window
for now. It was exciting to discover
that Berlin’s Erik Friedlander has
worked with musicians that included
avant-garde saxophonist John Zorn
and electro—acoustic pioneer Laurie
Anderson.

Further reading on Friedlander
revealed that this was a concept
album of sorts, based on surrealist
poems of Lautreamont, described in
the album’s press materials as,

“Intense, mystical and beautiful, it is
a journey into music’s darkest
heart.”

That sounds like quite a powerfu
experience. ‘

The album is 10 improvisations
long, or about 40 minutes, and each
song was done on a single take. I
tended to see a strong inﬂuence from
Laurie Anderson, with her very artsy
and cathartic buildups that rise and
fall repeatedly, climaxing several
times within the same track. If you
were expecting the second coming of

Beethoven or Bach, I’m sorry, this

record isn’t for you.

Quite bluntly, this album is crazy
and creepy. Paranoia sets in with
every track, as pieces such as the
closer, “A Sewing Machine and an
Umbrella,” sound like the diary of la
mental patient put to the soundtrack
of a lone cello. If you were under the
effects of hallucinogenic substances,
I would stay far away from this. I
don’t think it’s one of the last things
you want to hear at night before you
go to bed, either. But if you’re.pre-
pared for a ro1ler—coaster ride that
will shake you and break you with its
experimentalist tracks, hallelujah
This might be the album you need in

The death metal scenes in

one trend seems to be

— a solid defense.
Following a year in

what is happening to his fellow linemen.
“Right now, we have no depth, which worries 1ne,”
Simonitis said. “We have to run-block better. Once we get
back healthy we will be all right.” —
Both the Blue and Gold squads combined for 58 car-

can’t block, you can’t run.”
The Blue squad got on the scoreboard first

Luke Getsy ran right and pitched to DelSardo,
who was running left, for the score to put the
Blue squad on top, 7-0.

Neither‘Getsy, nor Tyler Palko, who

“[The defense] watched ﬁlm ‘of last year, and

Both defenses seemed to have no problem
tackling on Saturday, and only gave up a total of
20 points. The 20 points might seem rather low,
but it should not have been that high. The first
touchdown was on a reverse to Joe Del Sardo for
a 33-yard touchdown, and one of the field goals
was set up by a Joe Clermond interception right
before the half.

The trick plays used by the offense was an
indication that they knew they needed to do
something to move the ball on this defense.
Besides -the reverse to Del Sardo, a second
reverse was run late in the game to Larry Moore,

and at least 20 screen passes. All of these plays
were attempts to keep an aggressive defense off

  Wade should be NBA

Rookie of the Year

 

As the National Basketball.

Association wraps up another sea-
son, rookies LeBron Jarn.e_s’“.and
Carmelo Anthony’s teams -are bat-
tling for their playoff lives.

A-s of ' yesterday, James’
Cleveland Cavaliers sit two games
out of the post-season with two

. games remaining on their schedule,
-while Anthony’s Denver Nuggets

are tied with the Utah J az_z for the

final playoff spot in“ the Western

Conference. ' V . —

./ One of these two players will
most likely be named “Rookie_of
the Year,” regardless of whether or
not their team qualifies for the post-
season. -

But in the midst of all the hype
surrounding these two players, one
rookie has put together an excellent
season and taken his team to the

place to which James and Anthony’

are aspiring.

Pitt fans should remember him
well. He scored 20 of his 22 points
in the second half of last year’s
regional semifinal NCAA
Tournament game to. lead Marquette
to a 77-74 victory over the Panthers
that ended their season and Brandin
Knight’s extraordinary collegiate
career.

‘ That man, Dwyane Wade of the
Miami Heat, has averaged slightly
more .than 16 points , and four
rebounds per game during his first
professional season in helping the
Heat to a .500 record, good enough
for the fifth playoff spot in a weak
Eastern Conference.

A‘ solid season by anyone’s
standards, Wade has produced con-
sistently for the Heat despite being

for “Rookie of the

on the" Cavaliers and Nuggets,
James and Anthony average approx-
imately 21 points per game apiece.
Wade manages to score 16 points
per game on a team that features
two other players .who average
more than 17 points.

Unfortunately, most people who
vote- for the “Rookie of the Year”
don’t take into account“ the perfor-
mances of the candidates’ teams,

_similar to the people who vote for

the WoodenL?;Ai5vard for the most
valuable player int’ college basket-

For “instance, the Wooden
Award’s voters seemed to forget
that Connecticut’s Emeka Okafor
led his team to both the Big East
and National ‘championships,
whereas St. Joseph’s Jameer

Nelson, the ‘Wooden Award winner,

failed to earn even a conference
title.

Anyway, back to Wade’s case
Year.”
Considering that during the last two
years Miami had a combined record
of 61-103, with no playoff appear-
ances, the benefits of adding Wade
become even more apparent.

With Wade, the Heat is in the
“post-season for the first time in
three years and is -two games away
from a winning record for the regu-
lar season. A ,

While Wade may‘ not have the
flashy numbers that James and
Anthony do, he has been more suc-
cessful in ‘his career thus far and
should at least be recognized for
that. I A
And while James and Anthony
might be making plans for early

summer vacations, Wade and the ~

Heat will be playing for a champi-

a significant achievement of a dif-
ferent type.

Pitt.
Remember the drill? Turman
would play a few series and then,
just when it looked like he was
getting into a’ rhythm, Harris
would send Priestley out
with the offense.
Sometimes it worked;

sometimes it didn’t.
Sometimes it was just plain
confusing.

In Harris’ defense, it
would be impossible to
decide on a starter, mainly
because of the injuries to the
offensive line — a unit that was
never mistaken for the Washington
Redskins’ Hogs last season..The best
way to describe Pitt’s offensive line
in 2003 is porous, and when a
position that bad loses three
starters, it goes from being a
leak to a ﬂood. -

But even in that situation
—.having to run for your life on
every single play — there is the
possibility that one would per-
form better in that situation
than the other. At
times, Getsy seems
to have a better feel
for the pass rush, _

Quarterback, running back
still remain open on offense

Offense, page 17

completion being only nine yards. Despite
the low numbers, he did show poise in the
pocket, preventing potential sacks by
throwing the ball away in the face of the
oncoming rush.

“It’s frustrating,” Getsy said. “We
can’t do what we want, but we have to
play with what we’ve got.”

Palko completed six-of—13 passes for
49 yards, with one interception. His
longest pass was a 16-yard strike down-
ﬁeld to tight end Steve Buches. Palko also
tried a few option plays, most of which
were unsuccessful. He ran six times for
-15 yards.

“I’m not up to what I feel like I can

play at,” Palko admitted Saturday: “I did
not practice up to my expectations. No one
has higher expectations for me than
myself.”

Getsy also admitted that the ﬁerce
competition between the two quarterbacks
is great for practice situations. Every prac-
tice now turns into a game between the
two quarterbacks. Harris did not announce
who will be the starter come the fall. He
wants to give the two redshirt sophomores
an equal chance to win the job.

“Both guys are competitive, and they

our deg—re:

are not going to make my decision easy,”
Harris said. “Right now, I have not had a
fair enough evaluation yet to make a deci-
s1on.”
VV1th the loss of Kris Wilson to grad-
uation, Pitt is in need of a tight end. Both
Buches and Erik Gill are competing for
the spot, but Saturday wasn’t exactly the
best showing for either of the two. Both
tight ends had only one reception apiece
and both went down with minor injuries
that forced them out of the game. 2
Third—string quarterback Joe Flacco
threw the lone touchdown pass. With time
winding down in the fourth quarter, Flacco
hit Terrell Allen in the left comer of the
end zone at Heinz Field for a 34-yard

touchdown to cut Blue’s lead to 13-7.,

Flacco went 10-of-18 passing for 91.
yards, a touchdown and an interception;

. After losing Brandon Miree to gradu-
ation, the Panthers are also looking for a
starting running back. Raymond Kirkley
redshirted the 2003 season and is the front-
runner forthe job, but Jawan Walker also
tried to make a statement Saturday, hoping
to eam the position. He ran nine times for
26 yards, while Kirkley ran seven times
for 28 yards. .

VV1th the ‘offensive line not in sync, it
was hard for Pitt to run the ball in general.

Kirkley can ‘get "through it.

Therefore, the Panthers ran several screen
plays. Walker had the most receptions for
the Blue squad, ﬁnishing with four catch-
esfor 25 yards. Kirkley caught two pass-
es, but both plays were stopped behind the

" line of scrimmage.

“[The offensive line] affects us,”
Kirkley said. “But we understand a lot of
guys are hurt. There are 11 people on
offense and we have to work as one.”

After the game, Harris made it known

Clint Session (left) and Azzie Beagnyam (N . 41) close aihole before Raymnd

    

‘ill -_J

that Marcus Furrnan, who also sat out
Saturday with a hip injury, will be back at
the running back position in the fall. He
will provide Pitt with a third option at the
position. '

The offense will__have to wait out the
summer to see how well it will be in the
fall. The offensive line and tight ends need
to heal before Pitt’s offense can truly eval-
uate its quarterback, running back and
wide receiver situation.

his own four—yard line. That set the
tone for the defense.

The four key experienced line-
backers for the Panthers finished the
scrimmage as the four leading tack-
lers.'Sessioni led the team with 12
tackles, Blades had 11 and both Brian
Bennett and Malcolm Postell finished

-with 10. These tackles were accompa-.

nied by several big plays.

“I think we will be" a lot better with
me, Clint [Session], Brian [Bennett]
all playing together another year,”
Blades said. “We all play much faster
cause we know what is going on now.”

One of the many big plays

occurred early, when Session tipped a V

Tyler Palko pass and fellow linebacker
Postell made the interception. Session
would add a half of a sack to his.day,
which he would share with Bennett,

' who finished with two-and—a-half

sacks. The sacks seem to be a product

 of better pass rushing.

“Our defense has done a better job
of rushing’ the passer,” head coach

V Walt Harris said. g

All these improvements might be
a. result of two guys from Florida,
Blades and Session. These two seem
to be taking the lead of the defense and

, trying not to allow what happened last

year to occur again. -

“Defense is from the heart. You
got to play nasty and you got to play
dirty. Just can’t let someone come in
and take over like last. year,” Blades
said.

This seems to be the way the

defense is headed and it is a necessary A

change. “It .doesn’t matter where you
are from, we [Blades and I] came in
here trying to do it right, and trying to
spread that out to everyone,” Session
said.

After . a successful spring, the
defense is well on their way,.but there
is one goal they still have to achieve as
a defense. . '

“Last year we made mistakes. This
year, no excuses, we are just trying to

be the No: 1 defense in the nation,”.

Blades saidn. 1 ,
The defense will getra-chance to
stake their claim to that on‘ September

4th in South Floiiida.

With no clear favorite to be the starter, Harris could possibly go with both

Madness,page 19

but having a sixth sense for a 300-
pound defender doesn’t necessarily
put points on the board.

With neither quarterback separat-
ing himself from the other, Harris has
to go into the fall with both taking an
equal amount of snaps. That’s the
only’ way he can attempt to figure out
which one is ready to ' fill Rod
Rutherford’s shoes.

But he won’t. Harris will want
you to believe that he’s looking for a
starter, but chances are that he’s
already decided to use both.

With the numbers they’ve put up

in the mpinuscuplepf._-playing time
they’ve‘ received, ..ne';i.ther Palko nor
Getsy has the stats to_ put one ahead
of the other. i “ .p   _ .

Palko has played in six games -
all during the-2002 season + and
completed ‘two passes for 13 yards

and one ; rushing touchdown. Getsy‘

has alsoplayed in»six games'—— all
during the 2003 season, including a
start, in the season opener —— and
completed three passes for 32 yards
and has rushed for another 34 yards.
Neither one put up great numbers
in the spring game — Palko and
Getsy combined to go 13-of-23 for
85 yards and an interception. In fact,

the best quarterback on,Saturday was
Joe Flacco, who threw for a game-
high 91 yards and the game’s only
passing touchdown.

The quarterback situation now is
extremely similar to the one in 2000.
Turman could throw the deep ball
and make big plays, but Priestley got
things done under all different cir-
cumstances.

Harris’ two current quarterbacks
are the same way -— Palko has a
decent arm, while Getsy seems to
have a better feel for game situations.

Both are listed in the spring
prospectus as standing 6 feet 2 inch-
es and weighing 220 pounds. What it

could come down to is the fact that
Getsy is right-handed while Palko is
a southpaw.

That could work for Harris. If the
Panthers hold a small lead in the
fourth quarter, they could go with the
hard-throwing lefty to close out the
game or bring in the crafty right-han-
der to finish the job.

Or Harris could make a decision
and choose one over the other now
rather than eight weeks" into the sea-
son.
