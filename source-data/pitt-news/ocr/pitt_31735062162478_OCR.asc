Bargaining Unit Concepts

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Pitt faculty organizations and the
administration will argue their
respective concepts of an “appro-
priate" collective bargaining unit
at public hearings conducted by the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board (PLRB) scheduled to begin
September 23.

A collective bargaining unit is a
group of employes with.a common
interest who band together for
collective bargaining purposes.‘

The PLRB hearings will settle a
dispute over the proper composi-
tion bf the unit . among the
administration and the faculty
organizations bidding to represent
the Pitt faculty.

The Pitt Professional .Union
(PPU) claims the “appropriate"
unit consists of all faculty under_ the
Provost's direction, librarians and

I graduate teaching assistants.

Pitt's administration disagrees,

however, contending that faculty in .

the Health professions should not
be excluded from a bargaining unit
which involves Pitt faculty.

The American Association of
University Professor's (AAUP) will
conduct a referendum among its

It all started in October when

Delta Sigma Chi

BY IRENE SCHMIDT
Plans by the Ad Hoc Committee
on Intramural and Recreational
Sports to create new basketball and
tennis/volleyball facilities outside
Frick School are presently “a dead
issue" according to representatives
of the Pittsburgh Board of Public
Education.
The proposal presented for Board
approval stipulated that Pitt would

resurface the entire Frick play-
ground area across Fifth Avenue
from the Towers Dorms, construct
5‘/2
combination tennis and volleyball
area, and install lights for
nighttime use of the facilities.
“Frick was to have ‘exclusive use
of these facilities during all school
hours, including any summer
activities." said John Soboslay,

Frat Probation Restrictions Reduced

BY TOM SMITH

Director of Student Activities
Dan Meloro. has reduced by one
the number of restrictions on Delta
Sigma Chi in connection with his
order placing the fraternity on
probation for the fall term. A
meeting has alsobeen scheduled
this week to discuss a possible
appeal by Delta Sigma Chi.

Delta Sigma Chi has been placed
on probation effective September 1
for serving alcoholic beverages at a
party during freshman orientation
last month in violation of a directive
from Vice-Chancellor of Student

Panel's Vote

Monday to televise such proceed-
ings. ‘
Along with a 306 page summary
of evidence against the President,
Doar last week submitted to the
Committee 29 proposed articles of
impeachment--some drafted by
committee staff and some by
members--representing ap-
proaches -to the five central areas of
Presidential misconduct. They are:
--Obstruction to justice in
Watergate and related scandals.

--Abuse of Presidential privilege
in matters concerning government
agencies. '

--Contempt of Congress and the
courts in the President’s defiance
of subpeonas for evidence.

--Failure to maintain that the
laws be faithfully executed--an
explicit duty of a President.

--Bringing the office of the
Presidency into discredit for failure
to pay correct amount of income tax
and the use of federal monies to
improve personal property.

Staff members of those on the
Judiciary Committee have ex-
pressed the opinion that the latter
two areas will not be considered as
heavily as the first three.

Members of Delta Sigma Chi will
noxz be permitted to apply fo_r a
loa from the IFC emergency loan
fund as a result of Meloro’s most
recenttlecision. This had been one
of seven‘ restrictions placed on
Delta Sigma Chi.

Meloro changed his original
decision because the provision
affected in'dividual chapter

members and not the fraternity as a
group entity. “I changed it
because it penalized individual
members, whether they had
anything to do with it or not,"
Meloro said.

“It was not fair to cut them off

which was in the line of _a possible

action against the fraternity. ' I
made the error and it was not my
intent‘ to do that.”

George Kostelnik, President of
Delta Sigma Chi, agreed with
Meloro's decision, but is still

dissatisfied with the probation
order. “I think it is only right that
he changed the restriction," said

According to Dr. Robert Stucken-

rath, director of the Smithsonian’s i ‘

radiocarbon laboratory, who per-
formed the analysis, the dates from
last year’s fifteeen samples consti-
tute “one of the most consistent
columns of dates we've got

anywhere in the eastern U.S.” Dr.
‘Adovasio says they ‘represent

perhaps the longest continuous
documented sequence of human
habitation in the East and one of
the longest in North America.
Except in Alaska and a few places
in the West, he says, the first signs
of human habitation on the
continent begin about 9000-10,000
BC, and hundreds of samples have
tested out in that range.

Fortunately, the site has never
been discovered by relic hunters,
or, for the most gart, disturbed by
burrowing rodents.‘ The various
floors of soil are level and relatively
easy to distinguish from one
another. In addition, the dryness
of the site. a function of the
enormous rock overhang, has
preserved artifacts to a degree
extraordinary in this part of the
country.

The other six restrictions will still

_ rights and privileges, participation

i as long as “the participation is not
 as a group entity.” He
 p"---commented, “Action has been
i V takenﬂagainst the fraternity on the
asis of a group entity. Their
M activities will be quite similar, for
 example, they can participate in
 intramurals, but not as the group
' ‘entity, Delta Sigma Chi.”
' Kostelnik, meanwhile, has sent a
 letter to Meloro protesting the
decision. The letter reads, “Delta
* Sigma Chi Fraternity feels that the
restrictions set forth are extremely
severe and detrimental to the very
existence of our organization. We
would appreciate a conference with
you in the near future for further
discussion of this matter."

The conference has been
scheduled for Thursday evening.
According to Dina Natali, advisor
‘to the lntrafraternity Council and
theiPanhellenic Association, the
_ letter .from Delta Sigma Ch'i
 represents a formal appeal.

" according to Meloro is to “discuss

superior. If everything is status
quo I’m still comfortable that it’s
strictly under my jurisdiction.”

The probation order will be
rescinded in January, according to
Meloro. “as long as Delta Sigma
Chi does not break any other
rules."

In addition,‘ a dismissed mentor,
Mike Lessing, claims his dismissal
from the mentor program by
Director of Orientation, Jacqueline
Mullens, is related to the Delta
Sigma Chi incident. Lessing is also
a member of Delta Sigma Chi, and
the only mentor from that
fraternity.

“l was called into Jackie
Mullens‘ office the day after the
party," said Lessing. “She asked
me if I was serving alcohol and,l
told her I wasn't." Later that
afternoon Mullens dismissed Less-
ing “for conduct unbecoming a
mentor because my attendance at
the party portrayed a bad image of
the University."

Both Mullens and Orientation
Chairman Michelle DeJean claim
Lessing’s dismissal has nothing to
do with the party at Delta Sigma
Chi. “It’s his personal thing,” said
Mullens. “This has to be put into
perspective. There are two definite
things involved that are unrelat-
ed.”

The orientation committee and
staff were informed the following
day of Lessing's~ dismissal. “I told
the mentors thay were not to
assume it had anything to do with
the Delta Sigma Chi incident," said
Mullens. They were not given the
specific reason for his dismissal
and told to contact Lessing if they«
were interested. H

Margie Masilunas, a member of
the Orientation‘ committee said,
“Nobody heard the real reason.
Jackie told us there were other
reasons, but I couldn't believe it."
She added Lessing could have been
dismissed due to “personality
conflicts with Jackie." 

Masilunas added, “There were
rumors that he had bought alcohol
for freshmen, but if that were the
case then a lot of «people would
have been dismissed. I know one
mentor -had a wine and cheese

party in one of the nationality
rooms."

Lessing maintains he knows of
no other reason for his dismissal.
DeJean commented. “If he isn't
talking about it, it's not because he
doesn't know."

Mullens agreed. "Put yourself

in his position," she said. “It
would be very unpleasant for it to
be public. Would you be

comfortable sharing it with some-_

one?”

Lessing said, “I have a feeling
I’m being shafted. I don’t have a
feeling, I know I’m being shafted.
I don’t know why I was reported. I
don’t know why I was kicked out.
Jackie didn’t tell me the whole
story. lknow that. The only reason
she gave me was the party. If there
is something else I don’t know
about it.” r . -

Lessing plans to appeal the
decision, and claims the support of
the mentors in his case.

Mullens, however. maintains
there is no formal appeal process.
“Dr. Moye supported my de-
cision," she said. Lessing can
appeal to the Orientation Commit-
tee, according to Moye. “It was a
decision made by the student
committee. and he can appeal it to
the student committee."

Bike Racks

Bicycle theft prevention at Pitt
will be stepped-up with the use of
special racks and locks as a result
of action by the Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB), the University
Office of Business and Finance and
the Campus Police.

According to SGB President-

Furick, Pitt is_ planning to order
new bicycle racks similar to those
now in use at Carnegie Mellon
University [CMU].’ The racks have
bars which fit through the wheel of
the bicycle and is then secured with
a lock by the owner.

Initially '10 racks, holding five

effort to curb the theft which
claimed 73 bicycles on campus this
year. V '

Additionally. the Student Govern-
ment is planning to buy heavy case
hardened locks to sell at cost to
students. These locks have also
been used at CMU. “We have a
lock." said Furick, “that's guaran-
teed uncuttable. We hope to sell it
in the Student Union or the
Bookstore." The Campus Police,
according to Furick, tested the lock
and were unable to even dent it.

If students take advantage of
these- new racks and locks, and
their use proves successful addi-
tional ones will be ordered, Furick
said. '

The racks and locks should be
available sometime ‘in September,
according to’ Furick.

Furick added that this bicycle lock
and rack combination has cut thefts
dramatically at CMU. '

The Campus Police .have also
taken measures to curb bicycle
thefts.

his decision to vote for impeach-
ment.

“The evidence convinces me that
my President has lied repeatedly,
deceiving public officials and the
American people,” Hogan said at a
Capitol Hill news conference.

“Unless Richard Nixon is re-
moved from office and this disease

'of Watergate which has sapped the

vitality of our government is
purged from the body politic,
government and politics will
continue to be clouded by mistrust
and suspicion," he said.

Hogan's action initiates interest
in how other Committee Republi-
cans might vote on impeachment.
All Democrats, according to many
Congressional aides, are expected
to vote for impeachment, thus
focusing attention on the "swing
votes," or votes among the
Republicans which might go either
way.

According to one Congressional
source, there are seven Republi-
cans who are opposed to impeach-

ment and who will vote accord-J
ingly. They are Charles Wiggins‘

IR-CA], Edward Hutchinson [D-
IL] ranking Republican,‘ Charles
Sandman [R-NJ], Delbert Latta
[R-OH], Wiley Mayne [R-IA],
David Dennis IR-IN], Henry Smith
IR-NY] and iCarlos Moorhead
[R-CA]. ’

Eight other Republican mem-
bers. according to the source, are
considered “swing votes.” They
are: Robert McClory (R-IL),
Thomas Railsback (R-IL), Hamilton
Fish (R-NY), Caldwell Butler
(R—VA).
and Joseph Maraziti (LR-NJ).

William Cohen (R-ME) has
indicated he might vote for
impeachment, while Lawrence
Hogan (R-MD) announced his
intentions yesterday.

The predictions were similar to
those forecasted in this week's
edition of Time, except that the
weekly magazine thought Hamilton
Fish would vote for impeachment,
and that Wiley M_ayne' was more
inclined to vote against it.

Since more evidence is not likely
to be forthcoming before the entire
House votes on impeachment,
members of the House, after
examining traditional factors, will

The Pennsylvania State Educa-
tion Association (PSEA), another
teachers organization vying to
represent Pitt faculty, has not
committed itself to a deﬁnition of
an “appropriate” unit.

Another group, the Pitt Law
Faculty Association, contends that
law professors should be in a
separate unit from other Pitt
faculty members.

The unionization process began

at Pitt last year when two groups,

the PPU and AAUP, began
soliciting “authorization cards" .
from Pitt faculty who were

interested in forming a teachers’
union on the campus.

Once 30% of the cards (a
percentage required by law) were
collected by the "PPU, it petitioned
the PLRB asking that an election be
held among interested organiza-
tions to name a representative for
Pitt faculty. _

Law School Fund Grows

BY ANDREA ZIPF
2 The Sarah Scaife Foundation has
pledged $250,000 to Pitt's School of
Law Building. The pledge is part of
the school's $2.1 million fund
raising campaign: headed by
William J. Copeland, Vice Chair-
man of Pittsburgh National Bank.
The school's campaign is part of
the University's current overall $35
million fund-raising effort.
According to the Scaife Founda-
tion, the grant will be made in five
annual $50,000 installments. The
pledge -boosts total gifts and
pledges to the School of Law’s
portion of the University fund
campaign to $931,000.

The School will use the $2.1
million it hopes to raise in six
different areas. The money will be
used to furnish and equip the new
law building under construction on
the corner of Forbes Avenue and S.
Bouquet Street. The law library
will also be expanded by 150%.
The library presently has about
85,000 books, many being in
storage because of the lack of space
in the Cathedral of Learning where
the Law School is presently located.

“The law library is the very heart
of the law curriculum, which is
based largely on readings of case
histories in law,” said Law School
Dean W. Edward Sell. “Right now
we have an invaluable community
and University resource packed
into spaces scattered over four
floors of the Cathedral of Learning,
with thousands of books in storage.
We simply do not have enough
shelf space and, in consequence,
we have had to limit our
collection.” A

The library to be constructed in
the new building will more than
double the capacity of existing
facilities.

The campaign money will also be

/used to endow a distinguished

professorship. to establish a
program of continuing education
open to all bar association
members of Western Pennsyl-
vania, andlto fund a program of

_basic legal research.

Finally the funds will be used to
establish four teaching fellowships
in the law school. “The fellowships
will provide for a year of
post-graduate study after law
school,” said Wydo. “The four
students would also teach some
undergraduate courses in basic
law, courses which the College of

.Arts and Sciences would like to

initiate, but have been unable to
do.”

The new law building is expected
to be completed by the late fall of
1975 and could possibly be in use
by January 1976.

New Bike Racks

To foil Theives

(Continued from Page 2)

Campus Police Chief, Charles C.
“Curt” Graham, said patrols and
surveillance of- the areas where

students lock their bikes have been

increased. This increased effort
has proven somewhat successful,
according to Graham, as in the first
six months of 1974 there has been
15 recovered bicycles and 12
arrests, as opposed to five
recovered bikes and no arrests for
all of last year. Despite these
efforts, however, bicycle thefts
over the first half of this year have
already exceeded by 50%
number of thefts for all of last year.

Graham noted the Campus Police
havela perfect convi_ction rate on
those arrested. “We will continue
to do the best we can, but we

depend upon the student taking-

preventive measures,” he added,

urging students to never leave their . I

bikes unlocked or unattended.

Graham suggested bicycle owners '

record the serial number of their
bicycle and keep some proof of
ownership. In order to recover a
stolen bike, he stated, ownership
must be proved.

Graham added the Campus Police .

also have a bicycle registration
program in which the bicycle is
engraved with an identifying
number that cannot be removed.

’ “Once abicycle is stolen, the

owner should report the theft as
soon as possible to the Campus
Police," Graham said, because
once it leaves campus the chances
of recovery are slim."

this project is in our, mutual
interest," said Coble. “I have
written to the Superintendant, Mr.
Olson, asking "him to reopen the
matter. At this point I have not
heard from him. .

“I. would like to meet with the
Board and with representatives of
the objecting parents, and I’m very
willing to include Pitt students in
this meeting, if they’re interest-
ed."

Pitt was not at the meeting of the
Board and the representatives of
the objecting parents groups,

according to Donald O’Rourke,

Principal of Frick School. “Pitt has
been very flexible throughout the
discussion of this project. I think
they wanted to let the parents and
the Board come to an agreement
before they stepped in. It turned
out that nobody was completely
opposed--there were just certain
conditions raised by the parents.”

The lack of parental input and
approval of the project before its
presentation to the School Board is
a major reason for the shelving of
Pitt’s plans, according to Deforest
McArthur, Chairman of the Parent
Representatives of Frick School.

“This was a last minute thing
pushed at the parents. We knew
nothing about it until two days
before its presentation, and it was
being presented as if it was OK
with everybody."

According "to McArthur, the
parents feel the proposed improve-
ments “would be a good thing for
the kids,” but the permit arrange-

merely result in a great deal of

  on The Evidence

 

    

 

 

 

r’ .

The House Judiciary Committee has completed its hearings and will
begin debate on the question of impeachment today. A vote by the
Committee is expected next week to recommend to the House of
Representatives, and justiﬁably so, the impeachment of President

A ‘Richard Nixon for high crimes and misdemeanors.

For the most part the committee has taken its responsibility very
seriously not allowing partisan political differences to interfere with the
impeachment processes. Most members have been complimentary of
Doar’s presentation of the evidence against the President.

Both he and nominal minority counsel, Albert Jenner, have urged
the committee to recommend impeachment. Doar was quoted by one
member as saying, “Reasonable men acting reasonably would ﬁnd the
President guilty.”

Twenty-nine articles encompassing ﬁve areas of impeachment have
been presented to the committee by the counsel. The ﬁve areas
include: obstruction of justice in the Watergate burglary and related

crimes, abusing the powers of his office in the treatment of

governmental agencies, contempt of Congress and the courts by

" defying subpoenas sought for evidence, failure to carry out his

constitutional duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,
and abusing his ofﬁce by underpayment of income taxes and use of
Federal funds to improve his personal property.

The evidence against the President is overwhelming. The President
has not only sanctioned but encouraged a cover up of the Watergate
scandals. After accepting the resignations of his closest assistants,
John Elirlichman, H. R. Haldeman and John Dean, Nixon has

- , continually refused to supply the American people with all the evidence
available, which the President maintains will exonerate him.

', The White House has sanctioned and encouraged the use of
governmental agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service to award
friendships and punish enemies.

The President has sanctioned and encouraged the break-in and

A coverup of the break-in of Dr. Lewis Fielding, Daniel Ellsberg’s
t ‘psychiatrist. He has wrapped the Ellsberg case in a cloak of national

security. One of his top aides, Charles Colson, says his involvement in

_ the Elsberg case was initiated only on the orders of the President.

The President sanctioned and encouraged his tax accountant to
include as a deduction the President’s vice-presidential papers.
Addit_ionally, the General Accounting Office has concluded

" improvements of the President’s homes were made at the expense of
O American taxpayers for his personal improvement and not for the

increased security of the President.

Most importantly, though, the President has refused to honor the
subpoenas of the House Judiciary Committee and the Special
Prosecutor’s Oflice. Yet, he maintains this evidence will exonerate
him. If the President is subjecting the American people to a tragic
impeachment process when he is innocent he is doing agreat
disservicenotonlytotheAmericanpeople, butalsotoAmericaas an
institution. '

For example, the President and the Special Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski are engaged in a court battle before the supreme interpreter
of the Constitution, the Supreme Court, to decide crucial questions of
presidential powers and privileges. The framers of the Constitution
failed in some areas to specify the relationships among the executive,
legislative, and judicial branches. The nation has survived nearly 200
years of that ambiguity. “ .

That was done deliberately, and the President’s challenge to the
Supreme Court to interpret deﬁnitively this relationship is A, a great
disservice to the constitutional processes he has sworn to uphold.

The President has decided his course and that is to ﬁght and resist.
Now, the Judiciary Committee must recognize its crucial responsibility
in the impeachment processes. The evidence is there for all members

to evaluate. Each and every member must decide for himself either to .

vote yes on impeachment and accept their responsibility to uphold the
constitutional processes of government, or vote no and deny the basis
for existence of the nation.-

Not only can reasonable men ﬁnd the‘ President guilty of.

impeachment, but members of the Judiciary Committee who are not
charged to pass verdicts on the basis of guilt or non-guilt, should have
little difficulty in ﬁnding reasons to impeach the President, and bring
his case to a Senate trial.

A vote of impeachment will fortify the American system and
preserve its integrity for future generations.

One Last Chance for Nixon

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Giving a guy one last chance is
the American way. just like in those
war movies where the GI reaches to
help the insidious Nazi otit of the
water. and almost gets knifed for
his effort.

Superman even gives Brainiac
one last shot. Batman has an
amount of compassion for the
Joker. l am giving Nixon one last
chance. It is an American
tradition.

In the wake of the Watergate
Follies, we have strewn about the
country the floatsam and jetsam of
what was once one of the most
tightly organized executive bran-
ehes this country has ever
witnessed. l will go so far as to say
even Adolf Hitler or John F.
Kennedy looked sick in comparison
to Nixon’s clique of powermongers.

Following’ the incredible man-
date of the last election, Nixon and
his slap-happy crew set out to
convert this country into a place we
could all be proud of, a nation with
forward-looking advisors gathered
around the chief.

These men were under pressure.‘
Long nights at the office, gallons of
coffee and novels full of innocently

' obscene language were consumed.

'An esp_rit de corp was formed, a
bond of suffering, of shared goals.
These men knew each other from
top to bottom, from cell to cell.
They could be frank and sincere.
They were a family, a brotherhood
dedicated to the goals of the Nixon
administration, often turning down
more lucrative jobs in the outside
world.

Letter

To the Editor:

Since most of the damage that can
be done has already been done, it
may be too late to suggest that Tom
Smith be given something to do
that is more socially useful than
living out his fantasy of being a
great post-Watergate investigative
reporter.

The reason that l and most other
English Department members have
chosen not to discuss the disputed
tenure cases with him is that we
wished to avoid a situation in which
three decent and (as we see it)
eminently deserving people might
be casually destroyed in an
essentially invalid adversary pro-
ceeding. The real issues have to do
with professional philosophy and
institutional governance, and these
questions will be resolved for our
time and place not by Mr. Smith or
me or the three unfortunates who
surfaced at the wrong historical
moment but by the collective

\wisdom of the whole University
body when it debates, throughout
the coming year, the tenure
regulations that have been
recently proposed. The English
Department by and large holds to
one model, the Dean to another.
The Dean is a decent and honorable
man, with a passion for justice
according to his lights. We are a
decent and honorable faculty, with
a passion for justice according to
our lights. But deans and faculties
have been misguided before, and
what we all need at the moment is
more dispassionate light and less of
the adversarial heat that Mr. Smith

willing,to walk over his grand-
mother for Nixon, and although
others might not have been quite as
radical. I'm sure they would have
been willing to step on at" least a
close uncle or two.

A handful of press agents and
liberal Congressmen found this
arrangement not to their liking.
Snubbed perhaps by the seeming
close—knit relationships. they im-
mediately jumped on a relatively
innocent prank, called the Water-
gate break-in aiid howled’ for the
destruction of the Nixon govern-
ment.

How can this innocent curiousity
be called a conspiracy to overthrow
the Constitution? How can these
groups of professionals dictate the
direction of the country? i

The fact is that the‘ Eastern
Liberal Establishment did not elect
President Nixon to office. But,
through the slanted ravings of the
press and the machinations of a
Democratic Congress. they are
trying to reverse the national
mandate of 1972.

People overseas, men who have
experience in politics and selective
programs and are neutral in this
matter. have expressed amazement
that America would so willingly
crush this poisonous issue to her
breast.

“How can you hound this great‘

man?” they ask- “A man who
more than any other President
contributed to the hiring of Henry
Kissinger as Secretary of State?”

Is it true about a prophet having
no honor in his homeland? Must
American always devour its own
genius in fear?

With Red China pacified, with
Russia as a growing and trusted
friend. with Europe COIlll(lClll in
our ni_iclear might. with our money
purchasing peace at any price just
about everywhere, Nixon remains
for history to name as the man who
finally engineered the global Pax
Americana. '

And now the powerful liberal
minority makes noises and sly
remarks about the Middle East
settlement, claiming Nixon has
been parcelling out nuclear capa-
bility like so much catnip to the
warring hordes of Arabs and Jews.
Liberal pansy prudes who never
worked a day in their soft lives put
over what they call reprehensible
locker-room banter between Nixon
and his friends. ,

There is a limit, Mr. and Mrs.
America. We have let the issue
blind our sight too long. Our nation
has much work to be done. A
second ice age is coming. lt is time
to crush the hand that feeds the
mouth that bites us.

There you are readers. You have
just actually read a pro—Nixon
column in a campus publication run
by students with leftist or at least
dubious leanings._ ,

Rabid Nixon supporters will,
obviously, love it, which is a heavy
judgment upon their taste, cred-
ibility and intelligence.

Nixon opponents may take heart
in knowing that if nothing else,\the
forms of free speech have been
obeyed. which is what you’re
always yappingabout anyhow.

to the Editor

One of the things" that one hopes
to inculcate in the course of liberal
education is the difference between
fact and truth. The telephone book
is crammed with facts, but there
isn't a truth in it. Most ofwhat Mr.
Smith has so far published about
our tenure cases is factually correct
but as remote from truth as it is
from basic human decency. If I
may adapt Oliver Cromwell, in the
bowels of Christ I beseech ye, Mr.
Smith. think ye may be mistaken.

A New Morality from Science;
Beyondism
by Raymond B. Cattell, Ph.D.,
D.Sc.
Pergamon Press, 1972, 482 pp.
Hrdbk, $17.50; pbk, $8.00

Over forty years ago the Spanish
philosopher Jose Ortegay Gasset
warned his readers against “new
moralities," which he considered
contraband excuses for compla-
cency and hcdonism. Few people,
then or later, paid much attention
to Ortega's advice, but the ethical

chaos of the 19605 seemed to
cnipltasi/.e his point. “New
moralities" were invented each

year by some or another aspiring
free-lancejournalist, wcrejockeyed
to the top of the best sellers‘ lists,
and were then quickly dumped as
soon as sales fell off. Morality-
making for fun and profit became
an American phenomenon, as
people anxious to enjoy themselves
sought and bought book-length
justifications for conduct which

, would have been inexcusable even

a few decades before.

Dr. Raymond Cattell is the latest
author of a “new morality,” but it
is easy to see that his book will not
become a best seller. To begin
with, Cattell is highly qualiﬁed to
write a book on scientific morality;

_ he is not a journalist and does not

live in Greenwich Village. Instead,
he has been Distinguished Re-
search Professor at the University
of Illinois since 1945, and has been
centrally involved in post-Freudian
physchology. ‘He has authored 30
books and ten times as many
technical articles, holds a ‘Darwin
Fellowship, and has been honored
by the New York Academy of
Sciences.
ln short, his is just the type of
important work which has been and
will.continue to be ignored by the
readers of best sellers, who do not
expect much and invariably get
what they deserve. .
The book‘s title indicates that
Cattell intends to" construct a
.morality from science, and the first
chapter is devoted to explaining
why the two traditional moral
sources, religion and art, are
inadequate. “The meaning of ‘the
truth of a statement,"’ he
maintains, “is its ‘fit’ to the outer
‘world including its predictive
value, tested by fact and logic."

Neither religion nor aesthetics can
meet this standard, because both

are essentially emotional and
irrational.

A new morality from science--but
from which science? Biology
chiefly, coupled with psychology.
Beyondism--a utopian vision which
dares to assert that a species with a
higher intelligence and more
refined‘ sensibilities than man is
possible and desirable--is based
upon Darwinian evolution, which
Cattell sees as the single most
significant scientificdiscovery of
our time. “Here seems to be the
message and the meaning written
still mysteriously but large across
the face of our universe.” lf
morality has to do with goals, the
goal of Beyondism is the promotion
of man’s evolution.

Cattell argues‘ forcefully for his
morality on rationalistic grounds,
but for those readers who remain
doubtful he advances a “forced
choice“ argument reminiscent of
Pascal's Wager. “If when all is
said we remain with legitimate
doubts that evolution is what we
think it is .the only logical
decision must still be to commit
ourselves to evolution. For only by
evolving in intelligence and know-
ledge can we reach the answer.”

Evolutionary ethics have been
proposed previously, most conspi-
cuously by Herbert Spencer in the

. 19th century. The Achilles Heel of

many past attempts has been the
very vagueness of_ the term
“evolution" itself. A.C. Ewing
asked in 1953 whether “more
evolved" meant “in accordance
with the main trends of develop-
ment," and then answered: “One
of the main. trends of human
development has been that people
have shown more and more
efficiency in destroying each other
in war. Does it follow that it would

continue?"

Cattell has no easy answers to
such questions, and that, paradox-
ically, may be one of the more
appealing aspects of his morality.
An a priori ethical philosopher
would be little troubled by such a
challenge: he would simply sweep
it aside with a wave of impressive
logic. Cattell, because he is an
empiricist, cannot skip with such
abandons through the moral
mineﬁeld; early in the book he
cautions that “the chief fault of
logic in practice . . . is that it sets
up too few and too simple premises
for logic to operate on--relative to
the real facts in a complex reality.
There is usually nothing wrong
with logic per se.”

ln answering Ewing's objection,
for example. a Beyondist could
point out that conflict between
human cultures has been one of the
prime components of past evolu-
tionary advance; war, to the extent
that it promoted this advance,
could then be seen.as good, or
more properly, “beneficial."
Ewing is right in maintaining that
most naturalistic ethics, Beyon-
dism included, are concerned only
with an instrumental good; but
several thousand years ,of unre-
solved moral debate seems to
indicate that intrinsic goodness is
an illusuory--if appealing--chimera.

With the caution so characteristic
of a scientific pioneer, Cattell
nevertheless outlines a number of
the properties of social evolution.
These criteria are: ‘‘(I) level of
complexity of the social organiza-
tion maintained; (2) size of the
populatin per unit area maintained
at a standard of living adequate for
effective citizenship; (3) the degree
of control over‘ the physical
environment--against ﬂood, fam-
ine, disease, earthquake, pollution,
etc.; (4) creativity in demonstrating

process to

   

adaptability to even wider sections‘
of the environment, e.g., coloni-

zing climatically difficult regions,

space travel, resilience to major

catastrophes; (5) movement in a

direction opposity to toleration of

problems long suffered in the past,

particularly the reduction of. . . the

welfare-econoniic-genetic

burden."

Herbert Spencer’s vituperative
critics assailed him for advocating
the Law of ‘the Jungle.as a code of
conduct between individuals.
Cattell believes most people have
misunderstood Spencer on this
point, but he is even more anxious
to make his own position clear.
Following the eminent British
anthropologist Sir Arthur Keith, he
points out evolution operates not

Human Space &Wet Fish"

BY J ORDIE DELLIQUADRI

“Form and space is like fish and
water; if we were all ﬁshes, water
would be our space," (notes on
space and form, Ming Fay.
sculpture instructor).

The existence of-visual pheno-
menon in space interprets the
sculptures by Pitt art students
currently on exhibit at the Up,
Gallery.

Seeing, or visual awareness, in
relation to the exhibition is
negative space--nothing--giving
position to positive form, as they
exist harmoniously in one another.
Upon entering the gallery, directly
in front of one’s space, balsa wood
sculptures thrust forward demand-
ing attention of their advances.

Existing in the same area, Doug
Simmons independently manipu-
lates space with energy. Construc-
ted of a plastic material attached to
an electric fan, his sculpture results
in form and time in space. It
operates at five minute, on-and-off

intervals, which require the viewer - 
to participate visually through its
holes as well as in the time that it * 

takes the form to fill with air or

_.Game.

"A“If we have to we will organize
boycotts of baseball ticket windows
later in the year,” he said. “And
we plan to move on pro football this
season, too.”

_r I He charged there are no starting
.black quarterbacks, head coaches
or general managers in the
‘National Football League.

 “It has to change." he said. Pitts,
"executive director of the Black
Catholic Ministry, said the Atlanta
Braves are in a “great position to
make a positive step."

‘- The Braves, who ﬁred Eddie
Matthews as ﬁeld boss -following
Sunday’s 6-2 loss to Pittsburgh,
have Tommy Aaron, younger
brother of home run king Henry
Aaron, managing their AA Savan-
nah, GA, farm club.

“_lt,_would be perfect," said Pitts,
"but I don’t expect it to happen.
There have been too many chances
in the past, and each time baseball
-management has come up with
some tired old face who just was

The demonstrators did not get a
major response from baseball
officials. Most headed to other
exits when they noticed the
marchers carrying signs.’

Pitts surveyed the pickets and
commented that “maybe baseball
officials think we look like a bunch
a damn fools.‘ But if they don’t take
action soon, we will have to take
other steps. »’

“We will do whatever we have to
in order to make our point to the
owners,” he said. “And if that
means blacks don’t go to baseball

Ken Brett of the Pittsburgh Pi-
American
Leaguer. was the winning pitcher
with two shutout innings of relief
and Luis Tiant of the Boston Red
Sox was the loser. He allowed three

rates. a , former

runs in two innings of work.

That really was the American
Leagues only lead and wiped out
an early 1-0 National League lead
which had been produced by Gar-

third baseman Ron Cey.

After Gaylord Perry had easily
disposed of the first five’ National
League batters. three of them on
strikeouts. Garvey singled and then
circled the bases when Cey dou-
bled.

That run had the standing-room-

ionly crowd of 50.706 roaring for

the home favorites. but the Ameri-
cans. who had pledged to all out to
win this game in light of their many
failures. quickly struck back.

Catcher Thurman Munson_open-
ed the third with a bouble off start-
er Andy Messersmith. Perry‘s sac-
rifice bunt moved Munson to third.

Then Rod Carew walked. With

neris struck out swinging. but John-

right and bounced, into centerfield.

ing Carew to third.

Messersmith. apparently unnerv-
ed. walked Reggie Jackson and

then Allen singled. scoring Carew

for the American Leagues short-
lived 2-1 lead.

The Americans would have had
more except that Garvey made a
diving stop on Bobby Murcer‘s shot
toward right and neatly tossed to
Messersmith for the final out of
theinning.

Perry protected that lead through
the bottom of the third and then
Tiant took over in the fourth.

And the National League came
roaring back. .

Bench and Jimmy Wynn opened
with consecutive singles. Then it
was Garvey‘s turn again. He dou-
bled. scoring Bench with the ty-
ing run. Cey immediately followed
with a grounder that scored Wynn
and put the National League on top
for good.

In the fifth the National League
made it 4-2—thanks mainly to
Brock. The veteran St. Louis Car-
dinal outfielder opened with a pinch
single then took off for second. slid-
ing safely as Munson's throw
bounced into centerfield. Brock

scored a moment later on Joe Mor-
gan‘s sacrifice fly. .

Free Agents Flourish
I r During NFL Strike

The National Football League
strike has provided golden days for
free agents and former ‘_‘ne'er-do-
with a yearning to play
professional football.

And each day that the NFL
veterans remain on the picket line
means additional scrutiny for the
youngsters by the league's coach-

es--and another chance to make the

club.

Each training camp traditionally
has its unusual players bidding for
a random spot on the team--a

basketball or track star, or a
soccer-style kicker.
But this year, many teams

_signed numerous free agents in

expectation of a mass exodus by
veterans. - .

“The goal," explained Pat
Peppler, director‘ of personnel for‘
the Miami Dolphins, “was to get
enough people in positions so we
could have good workouts for high
draft choices and other players.

“You can’t have workouts and
teach other people if you don’t have
enough people.

“We were also concerned about
the fact we have to field a team for
scheduled games, not knowing how
many players might come in."

The result of the uncertain
situation has been golden oppor-
tunities for people like Henry
Youssef-Ahmadabadi, an Armen-
ian kicker from Iran.

Youssef-Ahmadabadi went to
college at Clemson, but didn’t try
out for football, because he was a
Seventh Day Adventist and was
forbidden to work on Saturdays.

This ~ summer, he has been
kicking off for the Dallas Cowboys,

that_":s _ﬁ_ne."r

 

played football, but ‘‘I watched

some games on television."

“I'm not afraid," said Youssef- _

Ahmadabadi. “lsee these kickers
run off the field after kicking the
ball. Why be afraid?".

_Tommy Prothro, San Diego
Chargers’ coach, admitted he had
never heard of Mike Lee when the
team’s camp opened July 3. And _
samll wonder...Lee spent last year
playing semi-pro football with the
Las Vegas Casinos.‘-

“He might never have had a
chance like this if it weren'tifor the
strike," Prothro said.

Miami Coach Don Shula is
another coach with a lot of names
he doesn't connect with faces.)

“We needed some bodies,” said
Shula who had 20 of his 52 players
in training camp listed as free’
agents. “Most of these players
would be gone by now if it wasn’t
for the strike.” .

The Dolphins have gone in for
young players, who might surprise
them.

So far, quarterback Kenny Polke
has been a big surprise.

“We brought him down here
with the idea of having a guy
strictly to hand off the ball,” said
Shula of the, graduate of Dayton
University who was offered a $500
bonus; “But he’s done some
things we’re pretty happy with.”

Polke realizes his position. Like
most free agents. when the strike
ends, his chances of remaining
wit_h the team will become slim.

“I have no high hopes of making
this team and being an all-rookie or
anything like that," Polke said. “If
I can get my.foot into the door

The Rose Bowl has become a
second home for USC's Trojans-—
they've played in the New Year's
Day classic six times in the last
eight years—-and John McKay is
looking forward to another out-
standing season in 1974.

"I see no reason why we
shouldn't be better than last year."
says the Trojan coach. as , he

prepares for his 15th season. “Our
offense should be stronger, while
our defense should be quicker and
more experienced."

USC's record the last two and a
half seasons is 29-2-2, and the
Trojans have gone to the last two
Rose Bowls. ’

“I think we’ll have a better
record than last year [9-2-1],” he
says, “although I was very proud of
our 1973 team. Theyiperformed
well most of the season under
tremendous pressure. After all,
they had to follow a national
championship team that might
have been the greatest in college
history.” -

The 1973 Trojans scored 322
points. but they allowed 202, which
was 74 more than in 1972. The
season ended with a 42-21 loss to
Ohio State in the Rose Bowl.

The defense, says McKay, “will
improve this year."

Fourteen starters return, seven
on offense and seven on defense.
McKay considers four ofithem as
All-American candidates, including
quarterback Pat , Haden, tailback
Anthony Davis. split end Johnny
McKay and. of course, linebacker
Rich-ard Wood, already a two-time
All-American’.

Replacements must be found for

_AlI-American flanker Lynn Swann,

the leading pass receiver in Trojan
history; All-American safety Arti-
mus Parker, the leading interceptor
in USC history; All-American
offensive tackles Booker Brown and
Steve Riley; fullback Manfred
Moore, inside linebacker Charles"
Anthony, outside linebacker James
Sims and middle guard Monte
Doris.

“But we have several very fine
people returning," says McKay.

"and I'm also pleased with our
crop ofjunior college transfers. In
addition. we expect help from some
of the freshmen who will enroll in
the fall."

USC snagged eight JC transfers
this spring. three on offense and
five on defense.

A position by position break-
down:

BACKFIELD--“With Haden."
says McKay. "no team in the
country will be better off at

quarterback than we are. He had a
super year his ‘first as a starter."

As a 1973 junior, Haden was the
Pae-8 leader in total offense.
threw 247 times and completed 137

passes-—both school records--for
1,832 yards and 56 per cent _
completion average. He also tied

the USC mark with 13 touchdown
passes and wound up by complet-
ing 21 of 39 passes in the Rose
Bowl, despite ‘having several
dropped.

His backup, Rob Adolph, re-
turns,_along with five sophomore
condidates. Rob Hertcl. Mike
Carey. Howard ‘Studdard, Mike
Sanford and Jack Davis. McKay
says Hertcl and Carey appear to
have thejbest chances to play this
season.

At tailback, Anthony Davis will
be trying" to become the first USC

"runner to rush for more than a
thousand yards for three straight
seasons. As a junior,_A.D. whirled
for 1,1 12 yards and 14 touchdowns
and returned a kickoff 80 yards for
another score. He's run for 2,303
yards in his two years.

Behind Davis are senior Allen v

Carter, who has averaged 7.5 and
6.8 yards ‘a carry the last two
seasons, despite a series of
nagging leg injuries and JC
transfer Ron Jamerson [College of
the Canyons]. “We also expect'to

get help from two or three
freshmen at tailback,” says
McKay.

He"

At fullback are senior Kenny
Gray. junior Dave Farmer and.
junior Mark Wilczynski, along with
sophomore Ricky Bell. who has
been moved from outside line-
backer where he saw action as a
freshman.

WIDE RECEIVERS--“We
should have an outstanding group
of receivers." says McKay.

His son. Johnny. at split end’. has
caught 54 passes in two years for 10
touchdowns. Last season Johnny
averaged 15.5 yards a catch and
finished by grabbing six passes in
the Rose Bowl. Sophomore flanker
Shelton Diggs. a 9.7 sprinter.
averaged 22.3_yards on his four
catches as a freshman. He'll be
coming off shoulder surgery,
however.

Other veterans include junior
Kenny Randle, a 9.5 sprinter and
NCAA 440 finalist as a freshman
and sophomore Brad Rice. There
are two JC transfers, Junior Lee
|Long Beach CC] and _Mike
Robinson [Contra Costa JC].

TIGHT ENDS--“Jim Obradovich
had a fine 1973 season," says
McKay. "and this year we expect
him to be one of the outstanding
_tight ends in the country."

Aiscnior, Obradovich caught 17
passes last season, averaging 16.7
yards a catch. The Trojans
desperately need a good backup
man, however, and have candi-
dates in sophomore Joe Shipp and
Mike Howell.

INTERIOR LINE--“We’re losing
two very fine players in Booker
Brown and Steve Riley,” says
McKay. “They’re two of the better
linemen who have ever played for
USC. But with the development. of
several sophomores and two
redshirts, Greg Beard and Claude
Millard, we should have a better
line than last year’s. It will be big
and quick.” ' V ‘

Three starters return, senior
center Bob McCaffrey. junior

The military-backed govermnent
of Greece fell Tuesday in the
“aftermath of bloody turmoil on
-Cyprus. and the president of the
“island's rebel government re-
. signed. Archbishop Makarios said
he expected to return to the Cypriot
presidency in a few weeks.

These developments came in

quick succession in advance of a
scheduled Cyprus conference set
-. up by Britain with Turkey and
 . Greece in Geneva. The conference
 was to open Wednesday, but a
United Nations spokesman in New
York said he understood -it would
be delayed because of the
resignation of the Greek govern-
: ment.
, I Greece charged at the United
in Nations on Tuesday that Turkish
forces were expanding their hold
on Cyprus. and warned that unless
 halted..their advance ‘fcould lead
~ to a general conflagration."

. A meeting of the Security
"Council was called at the urging of
the Greek ambassador. Constan-
tine P. Panayotacos.

lJ.N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldhcim said he was “deeply
concerned about violations of the
ceasefire" in Cyprus. He said U.
N. peacekeeping forces on the
island are ‘in communication with
Greek Cypriot forces. but the
‘Turkish invasion force had not
_ made contact with the U". N. troops.
_i Former Greek Premier Constan-
tine Caramanlis. who had called
' the overthrow of Makarios a
if f "national disaster." was invited by
 Greece's military president to

Piff Young Dem Tapped

For Platform

Betty Nelson. a member of the
Pitt College Young Democrats. was
appointed yesterday to the Plat-
form Committee of the Democratic
Party of Pennsylvania.

The Platform Committee is a 21
member commission charged with
the formulation of the state
Democratic party platform. Nelson
was appointed to the committee by
Dennis E. Thiemann, chairman of
the state Democratic party.

“I am elated." Nelson said.
“This is the first time any member
of the College Young Democrats or
of college age was appointed to the
commission. It's truly an honor."

Nelson speculated that she might
have been selected because the
party was trying to select someone
to the committee that would

and racial differences. In fact.
when given its proper expression,
it requires that all men cooperate to
sustain and produce such differ-
ences. and give their lives to
testing their validities.','

Cattell refers to his morality as
The Great Experiment. and indeed
it is. At times frightening. always
challenging. it is an experiment in
which we and countless past and
future generations are inextricably
involved. but which we are only
now able to some degree to
comprehend and affect.

The first third of A New Morality
from Science lays down the ethical
premises; the rest of the work
draws the Beyondist conclusions.

“represent most of the views of the
Pennsylvania Democratic Party."
and because she is “a woman. and
a youth who is actually involved in
politics."

Nelson has held offices in the
Democratic Party for the last three
years. She has served as treasurer,
vice president, and president of the
Pitt College Young Democrats, in
addition to being state President of
College Young Democrats, and
treasurer of Young Democrats of
Allegheny County. She was
recently elected a committee
woman from the Knoxville area.

The Platform Committee will
hold hearings on August 6-7.at the

Penn—Harris Motor Lodge in
Harrisburg.

One wished that Cattell Uh"-ad‘
devoted more space to the

t‘outtdations of his ethics and less to
its tangible applications. Certainly
there is much more to be said about
the very concept of evolution. and
Cattell's critics are likely to
challenge him on a number of
epistemological problems. Never-
theless he has written an intelligent
and admirable book for the lay
reader and specialist alike. It is a
thinking man's book. and of such
stuff best sellers are rarely made.
But the power to provoke thought is
the first trait of a classic; perhaps
that is the fate marked out for this
work. I ‘ 0
