Posvar: Pitt’s Tuition M

By TIM PETTIT

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG AP—

During a budget hearing Mon-
day, three university presidents indi-
cated they would have bleak tuition
news, unless lawmakers prove to be
more generous than Gov.
Thornburgh.

lf the Legislature enacts the five
percent appropriation increases pro-
posed by the governor, tuition will
rise by at least $82 at the Pennsylva-
nia State University, $206 at Temple
University and as much as $‘2l5 at
the University of Pittsburgh, the
university presidents said.

The students‘ lobby, protesting
the repeated tuition increases, noted
that the state's funding for higher
education ranks last in the nation.

Thornburgh proposed a $|33.7
million appropriation for Penn
State, an increase of $6.7 million.

Penn State President John
Oswald, who had to raise tuition by
10.5 percent last year, said the uni-
versity “already has built in a tuition
increase of five percent into the
budget and it may have to go
higher." Undergraduates now pay

' $1,641 in tuition a year.

The proposed $74.5 million
appropriation for Pitt, an increase
of $3.5 million, will resultina tuition
increase “on the same order as the
rate of inflation, about 11 or 12 per-
cent,” Chancellor Wesley Posvar
told the House Appropriations
Committee.

The current undergraduate tui-
tion at Pitt is $1,790 a year. A l2
percent increase would be about
$2l5.

The tuition outlook at‘Temple
looks even worse. University Presi-

Tower C-Residents Complain»AboutElevators

By BONNIE E. THOMPSON I

Pitt News Staff Writer

“We got the shaft but no eleva-
tor,” proclaims a poster presently
gracing the wall above Tower C's
three elevators. Residents of this
university dormitory have been
without dependable elevator service
for the past seven months. p

Last August", an electrical fire
began in the machine room and
‘worked its,'way on down the center
elevator shaft. Consequently, all
-three elevators needed repair.

“Since September, the middle ele-
vator has been totally out of com-
mission, and only within the past
two weeks have the others» been
functioning properly and on a
steady basis,” said Peggy Romen-
tcheck, Tower C resident director.

“At thebeginning of the year, the
only working elevator was shut
down from l_l at night until 8 the
next morning for nearly a month,”
recalled Mark Warner, a sixth-floor
resident of the dorm. “We (the
students) were told that 24-hour
round-the-clock ._ work was being
done on them.”

Eventually, two of the elevators

I were repaired but neither one has

operated consistently. _ ,
“They are ‘always messed up,“
complained one resident, “and many
of the students have been inconve-
nieced all year.” i

Romencheck reported‘ seeing “a ‘

guy'on crutches hobbling down six-7'
teen ﬂights of stairs because all three
elevators were not working.”

A Residents confined to wheelchairs

' who had previously used the middle

must now go through Tower A to
ride the elevator there. “This is a

Living Units. Available In Fall   

By LINIDA MILLER

Pitt News Stott Writer

Two new co-ed living units i
designed to improve individual
health and-promote ecological living
in an urban environment will offer
students alternative lifestyles in
dorm life next fall. P

Both the Fitness Living Unit and
the Ecological Living Unit were
designed by resident assistants who
see a need for such units and the
long-term beneﬁts of each. i

FI'i‘NESS LIYING _UN1r~

After taking a survey-that deter-
mined a need fora living unit dealing
with mental and physical fitness,
Stacie’ Murrer and Jim Malenka
submitted a proposal to the Office of
Residence Life (ORL) and received
approval.

The results of the survey taken in
January indicate that 599 residents

. would like to live in the unit. Ofthe

599, 2l0 residents plan on living in
the dorms next fall and are willing to
move to the residence hall ﬂoor
designated as the unit. ' .

Murrer said the unit will be

in
Brackenridge Hall.

‘According to the proposal sub-
mitted to the ORL, this co-ed envir-
onment “will enhance the growth of
theresidents and simulate the ‘real

world‘ and interactions.” g _
Emphasis‘,in- the unit will be
placed on the direct relationship

betyveen physical health and.mental 

health. .
“When a person doesn’t feel good, “

PITTSBURGH AP-
From under a white dome that
shields an old but powerful refract-

_ing,telescope, astronomer George

Gatewood searches for clues that
may prove the existence-of unknown
planets.

-Because of an instrument he dis-
igned that improves measurement .
accuracy, the director of the Allegh-
eny Observatory at the University of
Pittsburgh is in the vanguard of an
exciting search to find planets’ out-
side our solar system.

Since planets around stars other
than the sun can’t be seen through
existing telescopes, Gatewood and
his crew at the observatory hope to
find them by electronically observ-
ing the motions of stars.

“It’s just like looking for a firefly
next ‘to la Searchlight. You’re just
blinded by the stars,” Gatewood’
says. “The star gives off more than a
billion times more energy than the
planet.”

“I'm extremely optimistic that
there are planets out there,” says Dr.
William Brund, director of plane-
tary astronomy for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion in Washington.

“Whether or not they will be
found is another question,” he says.
“lt’s not because they’re not there.
It’s because-we are limited in the
number of stars we can examine

I with the techniques we are using

from the Earth’s surface.”

lt’s theorized that planetary sys-
tems are the natural by-products of
star formation. If that's the case,
there should be lots . of planets
because there are many, many stars.

“There are 200 or 300 billion stars
in our galaxy. We know of a few
hundred million galaxies, probably
each one with a few hundred billion
stars," Gatewood says. “And there’s
no indication we‘ve found the edge.”

Just as there is the possibility of
planetary systems outside our own,
there is also a chance that life exists
elsewhere. I ,

“We find throughout innerstellar

‘space the basic molecules from

which life is formed. The likelihood
of these same molecules being found
on earth-like planets is very high,"
Gatewood says. -“The question is
how long does it;take for life as we
know it to form from these
molecules?” _

Allegheny Observatory is one of
five groups being funded by NASA

' to investigate various techniques

that could be used to prove the exist-
ence of planets outside our solar
system. ‘
“We are trying to explore as many
possibilities as we can," says Dr.‘
David Black, NASA project.man-
ager. ‘‘It’s getting very creative.”
“If we can ﬁnd that there are planets
around nearby stars, I can imagine
their existence would pose a chal-
lenge and a lure to mankind in the
next century much like the moon in
the l960’s,” Black says from the
Ames Research Center in Califor-

nia. “I think we’ll be driven to go A

there. It's very exciting.”

Just as the Earth and other
planets slightly affect the orbit of the
sun, astronomers believe extrasolar
planets would disturb the regular
motions of their primary stars.

A field of stars must be watched
night after night for the telltale devi-
ation in orbit. Ifa star has no planets
it is expected to move in a straight
line. If planets ‘or other celestial

bodies revolve around the star, a

variation in "orbit ‘should be

. detectable.

“This little wavy pattern. That’s
the signal we’re looking for,”
Gatewod says, doodling on scratch
paper. ‘‘It’s small though.
extremely small.”

Gatewood ‘designed and builtta

linked by a computer to the observa-
tory’s telescope, is much faster and
more accurate than previous
methods.

Foreign Students Housing A Success 

By LINDA MILLER ‘ I
Pitt News Stqil Writer

When Mohamed Faci, an interna-

. tional student from Algeria, came to-

Pitt four years ago, he had a difficult

time adjusting-to U.S. culture and _
F meeting people."

That all changed, however, in his

-. sophomore year when he moved

,,into the newly-created International
Living Unit‘ in Bruce Hall.

“While living here for the past
-three years, I’ve learned a lot about
other countries, about values, and
that people are not really different
‘after you get to know them,” Eaci

A said.
That is what Dr. Ralph Morrison,

. I tional Services, (OIS), had iii mind

.o-

 

 when he proposed -the unit in I977.

\ « '

The students in the unit come
from every continent in the world,
including such countries as India,
Pakistan, Japan, -Spain‘, and the
Netherlands.

“Living in the unit has given me a
better base to understand our cul-
ture after seeing it from someone
else’s eyes,“ said ‘Sam Cazanow, a
U.S. student and second-.year resi-
dent in the unit.,“The cross-cultural
exchange.is a unique experience."

The International Living Unit
could be described as a close group.
The unit has its own "steering com-
rnittee, goes on camping trips, and
hosts international dinners. '

Bob Mar_ra, the resident assistant '

_for the unit, said he has gotten to
know personally every member of

I the unit; something he doesn't think A“
would -have happened elsewhere. _.

It provides more information in

“lt’s a fairly straigh_forward sys-
tem. It’s just that the components
didn’t exist before to build it,” he
adds. “When.I first had the idea, I
thought,‘.This is simple. I’m sure
somebody else has donethat.’ ”

A prototype ‘of Gatewood’s
instrument was successfully tested in

I980 and a larger operational system ‘

is being ‘built. The astronomer esti-
mates the new detector will be ready
to begin long—term observations by
this summer. _ «

“Thefirst sample may only com-
prise of 25 stars or so—not—a large
number. Gradually it will be
increased to about 50 stars,”he says.
“We may eventually do hundreds of
stars.” ‘

It will take several years before the
Allegheny Observatory will be able
to follow the complete orbit of a star
that may have planets.

“I think they’re outithere. But I
have ‘no idea what the "frequency is.
If the frequency is high, we’ll find
them quickly. If the frequency is
low, it may take a little longer,”
Gatewood says. M

About $140,000 has been spent on
the system so far and Gatewood says
it may cost another $ |00,000 before

the work is done. The cost is being ,

ECOLOGICAL LIVING UNIT

Bob Marra has proposed the Eco-
logical Living Unit which is still ten-
tative with the following goals:

—learning to become ecological
within an urban environment
without sacrificing modern con-
veniences.

—~becoming more conscious of
man's role in the environment.

—-fostering habits and ideas for
leading a more self sufficient life.

“An urban setting is where a lifes-
tyle that minimizes man’s impact on
the environment is most needed
now,” Marra said.

Some of these programs might
include: planning and cooking their
own meals; sponsoring‘ an ecological
week; starting a recycling program;
and solar construction building.

While Marra said the Ecological
Unit is oriented towards the out-
doors and conserving, he indicated
the direction the unit takes will be up
to the students living in it.

An open house is planned for
tomorrow night from 8:30 to 9:30 in
McCormick Lounge and all inter-
ested students are invited to attend.

Tuition--

continuedfrom page one

dent Marvin Wachman said tuition
would have to be raised by 10
percent—from $2,068 to $2,274-if
the school received an appropriation
increase of $8.5 million.

However, the Thornburgh prop-
osal was less than half that amount.
Thus, Temple students might face a
tuition increase of as much as 15
percent or $310, based on remarks
made in January by Wachman.

Penn State, Pitt and Temple cur-
rently rank among the top five pub-
lic universities that charge the
highest tuition and fees in the
country.

During the budget hearings, a
‘couple of lawmakers seemed unsym-
pathetic toward the universities’
financial woes.

Rep. Walter DeVerter, R-Mifﬂin,
questioned whether the schools were
duplicating and developing pro-
grams _“without the proper eco-
nomic factors being looked into.

“Have we reached.-the point where
institutions are stretching ‘their dol-
lars beyond what they ought to?” he
asked.

Rep.‘ Carmel Sirianfni, R.-'

Susquehanna, suggested to Pitt’s
Posvar that if university instructors
had their teaching hours “boosted
"two or three more hours aweek, you
would. balance your budget a little
more easily.” ‘

But Posvar and Penn State Presi-
dent Oswald said productivity
among professors is increasing.

“Since I972, student enrollment
has grown by 17 percent, while our
full-time faculty has decreased by
4.8 percent,” Oswald said. “Clearly
that is a measure of productivity.”

that a distinction should be made
between recipients through a

Presently,“ the ability‘ to rob
that dependency income is ot

mined by status. Therefore, “Sle-
singer continued, “a child can be

ents left him a million dollars.”
Slesinger added that the rea- _,

so high ‘is because the fund was
designed to take care of old age

and not a slew of dependents.

Reagan's‘ program will affect
the schools indirectly through a
“trickle down” effect, Slesinger

be giving out fewer handouts to

the states, which in turn will give

out fewer handouts to the

iApp'roximately 20 percent of the
V population suffer from severe sleep
disorders. However, since sleep'itself’,.
_ is so mysterious, the reasons for
 sleep disorders are a mystery, too.
The Sleep Evaluation Center,
 located in Western Pyschiatric Insti-
T -' tution, is trying to take the mystery
out of sleep and- sleep disorders.
“People need to be more tuned in
A to the signiﬁcance of sleep prob-
lems,” said Pat Coble co-director of
the Sleep Evaluation Center.
. . “Research has now discovered '
- enough about the process of sleep to
i 5’ identify the differences in sleep dis-
orders,” said Coble. The center’s
“major life’s blood” according to
‘ Coble, is research. The Sleep Clinic,
A, where people with serious disorders
are’ sent by their doctors, is an out-
, growth of that research. ‘

Theicenter was established in July
1974. Formerly a nurse (5113 is 3“

' RN), entered the sleep research field
in 1970. She and David Kupfer (3150
co-director of the center) came to

on sleep.

People’s need for sleep varies.
Some ned eight hours, others only

three" or four. “There is a tremend-.

ous amount ofactivity going on-dur-'
ing sleep,” according to Coble.

Sleep is categorized into two
major areas: NREM (Non Rapid
Eye Movement) and ITEM (Rapid
Eye Movement).'REM sleep was

first discovered in 1953 by physiolo.-,-

gists. Eugene Aserinsky and Natha-
niel'Kleitman. They suggested that
the rapid eye movement was the
dreamer’s eye following the visual
movement of his dream. It is
believed that approximately 85 per-

‘cent of all dreaming occurs in the
REM stage, which is 20-25 ‘percent -

of total sleep time.

NREM sleep is categorized into
four stages, from the onsetof sleep
into deep sleep. NREM is consi-
dered more “restful" REM sleep,
though sleep walking and night ter-
ror (like a nightmare, but not
remembered by the sleeper) begin in

Massive earthquakes will devas-
_ tat-e California, the Hawaiian
, Islands will be wiped out, the Great
Lakes will pour into the Gulf of
Mexico, and Atlantis will rise again.
These are the late Edgar Cayce, bet-
ter known as the Sleeping Prophet.
And Joseph Hilliard Jr., author of
several astrology-related magazine
,_ _ articles, believes these and more will
' . (‘come to pass.

 
   
  
  
   
   
   
 
 

_ ,‘:‘The ‘Jupiter-Saturn conjunction
. in‘ particular isalso known as the

_‘C_urse’.o_n the Whitehouse’ that has
affected every president who's held

.A office during a conjunction, or every

' __ A 20. years," Hilliard said.

7

 "Since President William, Henry

Harrison, the cycle has claimed
seven presidents. Harrison died in
l84l. Abraham Lincoln was inaugu-
rated in I86] and was assassinated in
I865. James Garfield died in I881.
William McKinley ‘was re-elected in
I900 and died the same year. Warren
Harding was inaugurated in l92l
and died in I923. Franklin Roose-
velt, elected to a third term in 1941,
died in 1945. The last was John F.
Kennedy, who was assassinated in
l963._ ‘ I

“Not every Jupiter-Saturn con- --

junction has signaled the death ofa
president, but every one since Harri-
son has. There are differences
between the date they’re'elected and
the date they die, but thejinx is basi-
cally that if elected in a conjunction

year, ‘death-sometime afterward is

possible," Hilliard said.

“The planet Jupiter takes approx-
imately l_2 years to circle the zodiac,
while Saturn takes 28 and a half
years. Every 20” years or so, the two
meet and form a great conjunction

that looks like a star," Hilliard

explained. “In fact, it is believed by 2

some that the Star of Bethlehem was

the final state of NREM sleep.

Adults sleep in the NREM stage
for 70-99 minutes before going into
their first REM sage of the night,
which lasts 5-15 minutes. This is the
least intense REM stage of sleep.
The second REM stage occurs about
three hours into sleep and is _more
intense .psych_ologically. REM and
NREM sleep then succeed each
other in 90-minute turns throughout

the night, with the REM periods g
becoming more intense as the night‘

goes on.

This cycle of sleep is tied to the-

24-hour Circadian rhythm of our
bodies. This is what enables“normal
healthy" people to fit into the 24-
hour cycle of the sun, but many;pe"o-
pie with sleep ‘disorders have erratic
Circadian cycles. Without indica-
tors of time, such as clocks and the

a sun, the body would -still stay in this

rhythm.

’ It was once believedthat people
deprived of REM sleep could turn
psychotic, but this hypothesis has
been found to be untrue. However,

[REM-deprived sleepers tend to be

The conjunction is taking place

-for the first ‘time in an air sign‘
instead ofan earth sign; before'it was

Capricorn.

“This is taking place in the sign of
Libra. Being an air sign, it has more

of an effect on nature which explains
the destruction I talked about,” H/il-‘

liard said. -

‘~ “Also, the two volcanoes, Pele

and Vesuvius, may erupt in addition

to land rising from the ocean which ’

refers to Cayce’s prediction that
Atlantis will rise,” he added.

According to Rebecca Pet_tes of

- It is estimated that 20
"_percent of people going
to their doctor complain
of having problems in
getting to sleep, and 6
percent of Americans
say that they’ are insom-
niacs;

TheNational In-stitute
of Medicine is now
recommending to. doc--
tors that the dru.g dagl-‘
mane should ‘not be used
' in treating sleeping
problems. "Tests have
shown that it lasts longer
than previously thought '
and accumulates in the
body, thus affecting the
person during the day.

that d'reams are needed to work out
the problems,bu'ilt up through the
day. - ‘

But not all dreaming occurs inthe 

__tiniied. “That California would be
destroyed would be "influenced by
Pluto entering Scorpio. Scorpio
means upheakvals.” ‘

.Hilliard added, “The other

‘ straight-linelalignment of ‘every 179

years we’re looking at means_,a lot of
things. Because.of the gravitational

pull on the earth, faults, such as the . A g
‘ di,RA forthe sixthh ‘ﬂoor Holland’:

fault that scientists agree is weak.”

Hilliard said that the gravitational

occur ‘as we fall into sleep even

Sleep’s “X-ray" is the electroence- .

“The job of the clinic is to play

Coble stressed that sleep disorders
are almost always a sign of another

resolved, the sleep problem will
disappear. ' r

A physical and psychiatric exam
is done on the incoming patient and
then, if necessary, the patient is put
on a two-week drug withdrawal.
Often, according to Coble, this in
itself causes great improvement.

“Shoving sleeping pills into peo-

The Call For V
Unionizaetion  

Gollective bargaining.,.better working conditions...in-
creased salaries...These phrases are usually associated with
striking "miners, truckers, and baseball players. But because
of increasing inﬂation, decreasngsalaries and a dismal eco-
nomic outlook, university professors are beginning to call
for unionization. '

Pitt faculty unionization may be close to becpming a
reality. Unless organizatioiis representing faculty members
begin to work quickly and work together, Pitt professors
may be reaching for an unattainable goal. '

Professors around the nation are now in a desperate.situa-

tion. Incomes offaculty members of colleges and universities

, declined 18 percent during the 1970's. The future outlook f
isn’t much better, either. 0'

“If present trends continue, low ranked academicians will
enter the ranks of the working poor in'the 1980's and full
professors will join them by the year 2000,” according to
Richard Thorn, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the
American Association of University Professors.

Pitt faculty members are not without representation. The
Pitt Professional Union (PPU) has received 25 percent con- I
L ﬁrmation by faculty members to authorize them to-act as
collective bargaining agents for the university. The PPY
must have 30 percent authorization to be legally recognized ‘
as a faculty organization. '

( .

The AAUP is also competing for representation of -.
faculty. The AAUP recently asked for 5 one year delay on '
decision to form a coalition with the PPU. The "coalition,
which would be called-United Faculty of the University of

- Pittsburgh, would act as the faculty’s sole representative.

I

The reasoning behind the AAUP delay is the need to
consider alternative methods to collective bargaining.
Although it is wise for both ‘groups to consider the best
/ . methods possible to a<fhI€\é¢ thetr. goals, the factvremains that
- the current situation is not likely to get better.

Members of both faculty groups should realizelithe need, '

By John Haugeland
We can better appreciate this his-
torical pattern if we look at the two
most conspicuous examples that do
not fit it: geometry and astronomy.
These are special because they were
already technically developed and
sophisticated in" early antiquity; in
other words, they are as old as philo-
‘sophy itself. The same is not trueof
physics, linguistics, psychology, pol-
itical science, and so on. It's not that
the Greeks weren’t interested in
theses topics, or didn’t talk about

~them; but most of what they said was
'more like speculative educated

guessing than like science. They
were ingenious and even insightful,
but they lacked a systematic, precise
theory which a group of specialist.
professionalscould use in making
and checking detailed predictions. '

Furthermore, later history shows
that discovering such a systematic,
precise theory for the use of special-
ists is what generally starts a new
field branching off from the philoso-
phical stem. What does this mean? I
think t-he lesson in anutshell is: whe-
never investigators become confi-

_ dent that as a group they know what. .
they're doing (so now it’sjust a mat-

ter of doing‘ it), then they stop‘
regarding themselves as philo-
sophers and start regarding them-
selves as scientists. Our present .
concern, of course, is with the flip
side of this coin: what are the philo-
sophers up to? By implication from

_ what was just said, they are the ones

who are not confident that as a
group they know what they‘re doing
(though each individual may be con-
fident that he or she knows.)

The point is not that philosophersé
are more cantankerous or mutually-
suspicious than other folks are
(though that may be true‘); the point

concerns rather the questions stu-

died than the people who study
them.'I think the most general char-
acterization is this:_ philosophy is the
motley collection ‘of all those big
intellectual questions which nobody .
really knows how to answer. Any of
you who have studied philosophy in
college may already have noticed
this feature of philosophical issues.
But if you have gone on to conclude
that philosophers are just wasting
everybody’s time asking a lot of
unanswerable questions, then I
think/you've made a mistake. Philo-.
sophical questions may be
unanswerable now, but that does
not mean that they are unaniswera-'
ble ever. "And even if a_ few of them
are unanswerable ever, I defy any-
body_.to say, in advancejustwhicli‘
ones these are- I

Sometimes people say that philo-
sophy never ‘makes any’ progress.

Take -any philosophical problem,
they say, and very likely some form
of it was known to the Greeks. And
moreover, nobody has been able to
solve it since; Bt that’s thewrong
way to look at it. Of course any
problem that’s still philosophical is
unsolved; that’s why it’s still philoso-..
phical. But many, many philosophi-
cal problems have been solved-that’s
where the sciences came from.

There’s' one final misconception
that’s worth clearing up. It may seem
that if nobody really. knows the right
answers to philosophical questions,
then anybody’s answer is as good as
anybody else’s; kooks. quacks and
madmen arejust as legitimately phi-
losophers as the most distinguished
professor. Now I admit that it's
occasionally hard to tell whether
[‘somebody is a kook or a genius. The
mad genius is a popular folk hero;
and" it’s notorious that serious mis-
identifications arelmade from time '-
to time. But, for the most part, it’s
not so hard-to tell the one from the
other, and there are reasons for that.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 4, 1931

answer is a most emphatic, “YES!”
Coming to the University of Pitts-

burghiin the Fall of ’78, a green '

freshmanfrom a high school some
500 miles away, was an exciting and
also a somewhat frightening expe:
rienée. I was the 18 year old girl from

the “sticks”, plunked in the big city '

to “get an education.” It was here I
was told -I would gainthe “wisdom,
knowledge, and maturity" to pre-

pare me-for my future career. It was__
at this point in my life that I decided

what an education was really about.

.

To some people, an undergradu-
ate education is just plain, hard,

“book learning.” Four years with’

your nose to the grind stone”, cram-
ming for tests, wearing out highligh-

'1

ters, and “pulling all nighters.”

To others, being an undergrad
and the word partygwere
synonomous. ‘

Personally, I needed a middle of
the road approach. Sorority was a
part of that.

College is a once in a lifetime
experience. As a famous song says,
“We may never pass this way again.”
My philosophy is, “'If the opportun-
ity is there and it is worthwhile, why
not go for it?” So  did, and as a first
term freshm-an, I pledged a sorority.

Being a “greek” has opened many _

doors for me, and given me more

_ opportunitiés than I ever could have"

irig or swallowing all tend to create
effective and dangerous obstruc-
tions.

The easiest way to prevent this
from happening is to remove the
gum from your mouth when you
start to feelsleepy. Gum that is left in
the mouth while sleeping can easily
create an airway obstruction due to
the fact that you are lying on your
back with a pillow under your head.

The normal automatic reﬂex
would cause you to turn over allow-

-ingthe gum to fall from your throat.
However, if the gum is still ﬁrmly
lodged, you wil begin choking and
coughing. This will awaken you and
hopefuly, dislodge the gum. _

If your coughing is not forceful
enough to expell the obstruction, or
the airway is blocked enough to pre-
vent coughing, you will need‘t0\ per-
form a manual maneuver to reopen

the airway. If someone is readily »

available, have them perform the
Heimlich maneuver (a procedure
which is taught in First Aid and
CPR classes). If not, 'place the

Pm News Sports Writer

During halftime of the game last
night, Sam—Clancy told Pitt coach
Roy Chipman, “For once in my life,
I want to practice tomorrow."

“When Sam said that. I knew he
was ready," said Chipman following
the Pitt Panthers‘ 67-62 victory over
the Rutgers Scarlet Knights at the
Fitzgerald Field House last night in
the first round of the Eastern Eight

. Tournament. Pitt will advance to

the semi-finals at the Civic Arena in
Pittsburgh Friday to meet regular
season conference champ Rhode
Island.

Pitt had a four point halftime
lead, 37-33 against" Rutgers, ateam
that Pitt has never beaten in Eastern
8 play. In past games, the Panthers
had always fallen behind the Scarlet
Knights and had to play catch-up
basketball. Last night was no differ-
ent as a crowd of 4,460 witnessed
Pitt _fall behind early once again by
as many as 12 points before coming
back toward the end of the half.

Rutgers scored l6 unanswered
points against the Panthers to take a
commanding lead, 20-8, with just
over 12 minutes to play in the first
half. The Scarlet Knights were led by
Darius Griffin, who had seven ofthe
I2 points during the spurt. Roy Hin-
son and Clarence Tillman added
three and four points respectively.

“We have a history of getting
behind against Rutgers,” said
Panther guard Carlton Neverson.
“We start real tough but fall behind.
It’s typical."

Then the Panthers began to turn
the game around by scoring eight

_ consecutive points of their own, cut-

ting the Rutgers‘ lead to five, 22-l7.
Darrell Gissendanner and Steve
Beatty, both coming off the bench
led the Panther charge that got the
team back in the game.

PittDefeatsRutgers, Advances to Semi-Finals

Sam Clancypulls up for two of his game high 1_6__points in his final appearance at the Field House.

“I felt that the key to the game was
the first half substitutions of Gissen-
danner, Beatty and Clyde Vaughn,”
said Chipman. “They helped to calm
us down because we had no momen-
tum. They were responsible forthe

39

Win.

Beatty finished the game with l0
points, Gissendanner finished with
eight. Beatty also had feight
rebounds to supplement -Clancy
underneath the basket against the
Rutgers’ front line of Kelvin Troy,
Tillman and Hinson.

Pitt continued to control the
tempo of the game and was able to
take the lead,’ 31-30 with two min-

utes remaining in the half, on the
strength of two baskets by Clancy
and one each by Neverson and
Beatty. Neversonscored two more
baskets and Beatty tipped in a third
to give the Panthers their four point
halftime advantage.

“We felt ‘pretty good going into
the half,” said ‘Chipman. ‘-‘Rutgers is
a tough basketball team. Theyhave
the best defense we’ve played against
because they match-up so well.”

“The key to the game was getting

the lead at the half,” said Neverson.; .
“The guys ’ (Gissendanner . and ,

Beatty) coming off the bench did a
hell of a job.”

Gissendanner,Beatty Come
Of Benchto Key PittVictory

By AMIN Gil-‘IOSSEIN

Pitt News Assistant Sports Editor

The big Pitt victory ‘over Rutgers
was not decided by ,a Sam Clancy

dunk or a Carlton Neverson steal. It-

was not the defense that keyed the
win although it played well. No,’ this
game was decided by a couple of

ballplayers who don’t usually figure

in the ﬁnal "score.

The score was 20-9 Rutgers with
12 minutes in the first half. The.

Panther play was lacksadasical and »

uninspired. The Rutgers guards
were giving a" clinic onhow to pick-
pocket and run~a fastbreak. Some-
thing needed ‘to be done before the
game got out of hand.

Enter Darrell‘ Gissendanner and '

Steve Beatty. By the time the half is
’over Pitt hadja 37-33 lead. How did.
it -‘happen? Start ‘off with a Beatty
jumper then sprinkle‘ in a spectacu-
lar underhand layup by Gissen-
danner. Rutgers halted the Pitt duo
with a time out, but it is only a short
reprieve as Gissendanner came back
- with another Iayup'. Well, you get
the picture. By halftime Beatty had

/

 

l0 points while Gissendanner had 6.
That's 16 very key points off the
bench.

And no one injtheir right mind_

would have expected‘ it.

For§teve Beatty, revenge was on
his mind. After being badly out-

played by Rutgers’ Roy Hinson last‘ =

Saturday, Beaty was eager to play
the rematch.

“I was kind of depressed after Sat-
urday, I-Iinson outplayed ,me there,
so tonight I tried to front him a»little
more.”

A gangly 6'9”, Beatty is not ‘afraid
to’ mix it up underneath with someof
the bigger Scar1et‘Knights. I

“I may not have the ‘weight, but
getting hit by» bone hurts too,”
Beatty said. ‘

It has not been a great season for
Darrell Gissendanner. The reat-
quick junior harrrot seen much
action but after last*night,’s perfor-
mance, the season might just shine a
little brighter.

WI.

Coming off the bench he poured
in 8 points and steadied the Pitt
offense with some heads-up play.

‘His modestyafter the game was as ,

evidentias his quickness during it."

“I just try to come in tiliere.and get
the job done. [just wanted,to con-
tribute," Gissendanner said.

Utilizing his superior quickness,
Gissendanner was able to sneak free

for several backdoor layups. Along '_

with his drives Gissendanner was
able to can two jumpers. The second
one was spectacular as he pulled up
with 6'7 Clarence Tillman and 6’l0
Roy I-Iinfson in his face and sank a

tough l5footer. Gissendanner’s play ,

put to rest, at least momentarily, the
belief that the Panthers cannot play
wellwithout Dwayne Wallace.

Sam Clancy and the crew have
had many a day in the sun but last

, night it was two reserves, Beatty and

G-issendanner, who came through
when it counted most and delivered
off the bench. 'For the two, it was a
night to be remembered.‘  A f

Having the lead at the half was
one thing, but sustaining it over the
remainder of the ‘game was another
thing. The Panthers "came outwith
the same ‘intensity with which they
ended the first half and quickly

T extended the lead to eight, 43-35,

four minutes into the second half.

“Taking the lead in the first half
was important,” said Dwayne Wal-

lace, “but keeping the same intensity.

to come out for the second half was
also. That was the difference mine
ball game.”

 Wrestling team

, finishes last _

By BARRY BARTUSIAK

Pill News Sports Writer

\ Though the panther grapplers fin-
ished last in the Eastern Wrestling

League Tournament this past week-
end, there was one bright spot. Mike _

Bond, Pitt’s 150 pound:re‘presenta-
;tive, finished second in his weight
class, which earned him a trip to
_NCAA tournament, March 13 and
14 at Princeton.

Bond, who was the ‘Eastern
runner-up last year, didn't have an
easy pathto the ﬁnals. After winning
his first match, he had to go into
overtime to ‘capture his semi-ﬁnal

match.i‘Wrest1ing very effectively

throughout the entire bout, Bond
found himself down by two points
with only 20 seconds left. But with__a
dramatic flair, he scored a reversal
to knot theimatch score and send-it

into overtime. The extraperiod was _

.5,-‘— all Bond, as he won going away.

Pitt men ’s team travels to Regionals

Swimmers Try for Eastern Crown

R By SEAN BARNES

T ifitt News Sports Writer

The Eastern ,Champion Pitt
Panther swim team travels to Cleve-
land State to defend their title this
week against 20 of their best men’s
teams in the East. A long season of
tough competition has the Panthers
ready to not just win, butito set new
records.

Pitt’s strongest competition at
Easterns will be West Virginia, Penn
State, and Maryland. These teams
not only have individual standouts,
but also the depth to put together

"strong relays. Pitt’s 400-yard medley
relay of Stu Swanson, John Wald-
man, Mike Lehto, and Rick Carter
is currently seeded first ahead of
WVU and Maryland. Also seeded
first is the Panthers’ 400-yard frees-
tyle relay of Carter, John McCrillis,
Jerry Zaleski, and Scott Shearer.

Both relay teams will be-going for I

the Eastern record as well as the win.

Pitt should also dominate the
individual swimming and diving
events. Three of the individual frees-
tyle events currently have a Pitt
swimmer seeded first, including last
year’s Eastern champion (50-and
I00-yard) freestyler Carter. Carter is
also seeded third in the 200 freestyle,
with Pitt’s Scott Shearer seeded

first.

Although seeded second in the
200-yard individual medley, Sandy
Pidgeon is a Panther who has
strength to overcome the three-
tenths of a second separating him
from Virginia’s first seeded
swimmer. Pigeon will also swim the
400 Individual Medley and the 200-
yard breaststroke. Maryland’s Kirk

Sanocki will prove to be good com-,

petition for both Pidgeon and Wald-
man, Pitt’s fastest breaststrokers
who are currently seeded first and
third respectively.

Senior Panther co-captain Swan-
son, Eastern Champion in the I00-
and 200-yard backstroke his first
three years at Pitt, will be trying for

four in a row‘ and a third NCAA ..

All-American 200-yard bacakstroke
title. Swanson’s graduation this year
will leave a large hole in the team

that will be hard for coach Fred Li
‘ meter Eastern Champion and was

Lewis to fill.

. Pitt’s Greg Pelto_n is seeded first in
the 200-yard butterfly with a time
that broke the longest-standing Pitt
team record. The old standard was
by I three-year Eastern Champion
butterfly~Mark Schuman.

The Panthers’ only weak poin_ts

are in the long distance freestyle‘

events. Although Pitt has the 1978'

Eastern Champion in the 500- and
I650-yard freestyle, co-captain Jeff
Trew, medical problems have kept
him from repeating those‘ outstand-
ing times. Trew will be swimming
both events at Cleveland St., but
West Virginia is favored in both
events.

Pitt divers, Pat Greenwell, Mike
Minik, and Bob Lambert have all
had a good season under coach
Julian Krug. Pitt’s schedule this year
has already pitted the Panther divers
against the‘ best Eastern competi-
tion, Penn State and West Virginia.
Brown and Greenwell (Pat’s
younger brother) from PSU will be
in top form as well as WVU’s Daily
and Treasurer. Dalaman and Kar-
ban from Cleveland will have the

. home-poiol advantage and should

also be good competition.
Pat Greenwell is last year’s one-
the 1979 Eastern Champion on the

three-meter board. He is the favorite
again this year and has a chance to

win Most Valuable Diver at the l98l _

Easterns. Minik has _had a very
strong first season with Pitt, and has

been successful in tapering his prac-.

tice dives the past couple weeks, giv-

in him strong dives with high.

V By MARIE HUFF

Pitt News Sports Writer

. This is not deja vu; you are really

i I reading this. The Pitt Pantherettes
 basketball team face, yes, Rutgers,
in the first round of the Eastern (

Regional play-offs at Rutgers Satur-

' '-day night. The game will be the

second meeting of the two clubs in
the last week. The squads contend-

' ing for the coveted Eastern title and

advancement to the National Cham-
pionships are, in the order seeded,
Cheyney State, Rutgers, Maryland,
Penn State, Villanova, Seton Hill,
Pitt, and Montclair State.

_ The task ahead of coach Judy
Saurer and the Pantherettes is a
tough one, to say the least. The Sca-
rlet are undefeated (28-0) on their
home court in the past two years.
Last year, the lady Knights went to
the “Final Eight” in the AIAW
National‘Championships. losing to

. the eventual champion, Old Domin-

ion, in third-rdund action. This year,’
Rutgers is currently ranked fourth in
the nation.

“It will deﬁnitely be consideredza
major upset if we defeat them,” says
.Saurer. “Many coaches feel that
Rutgers will be in the ﬁnal four at
the Nationals, but I think we can
: prevent that.” Rutgers defeated the
Pantherettes last Saturday night
here at Pitt 87-73.

  I  Women face R

Saurer will be going with Debbie

Lewis, Lori Dolby, Penny Welsh,

Pam Miklasevichfand Gail Augh-
burns as probable starters, relying

' on Carol Dugan, Lynn Love, Lori

Arent, Sue Koziol, and Beth Tarasi
to come offthe bench. Lewis, Dolby,
Welsh, Miklasevich and Aughburns
all average in the double-digits.
“Our defense is going to have to
hang tight with Rutgers," Saurer
explains. “We can't let them get
ahead by more than seven/or eight-
points, because they‘re atough team

' to play catch-up with.“

The Pantherettes are well aware
of this,-as Rutgers jumped to a 23-6
lead in the Pitt regular season finale,
and Pitt could not close the gap.
However, the Pantherettes did play.
the Lady Knights even in the second
half of that game. 1 ’ A

“There’s no question that we can
keep up with them,” says Lewis, co-
captain of the Pantherettes. “Like
coach Saurer said, we just can’t let
them get ahead.” V

Rutgers will be going with the
same starting line-up as the last
game. Of those five, All-American

. Kris- Kirchener, Joanne Burke and

Terry Dorner are consistently scor-
ing in double figures. The Coyle-sis-
ters, Patty and Mary, round out
coach Theresa (irentz’s starters. Kir-
chener did the most damage to Pitt
in the last game, pouring in 26

iitgersiiini first-round action

/

points. ’ ‘

“Kirchener is good, "but we can't
concern ourselves with just her,”
says Saurer. “Patty Coyle and Terry
Dorner put in l4and l0 respectively.
Jennie Hall came off the bench to
score l0 points, so Kirchener isn’t
our only concern.” _

On, the rebounding side of the
ledger, Rutgers has a slight edge.
Kirchener pulls down 9.7 rebounds a
game and Dorner grabs 7.9 every
contest. As a team, the Lady Knights
haul in 48.7 caroms each outing.
Pitt, on the other hand, gathers in
45.4 stray shots per game. The Pan-
therette rebounding contingent is
led by Aughburns, who is grabbing
10 rebounds a contest, and Miklase-
vich and ‘Welsh are each snatching
over eight caroms an outing.

To win, the Pantherettes are
going to,have to stay out of foul
trouble. Pitt’s Aughburns, Miklase-
vich, and Welsh are going to have to
stop the inside game of Rutgers as
well as control the boards.'The tran-
sition gamewill also be a factor, one
thai seems to favor Pitt who is the
quicker team. ‘

‘‘I’m not the type of coach who
would tell my players they could win
if they were down by 50 points at the
half,” stresses Saurer. “I believe that
you have to deal with them honestly,
and I have no reservations in saying
that I believe we can win this game.”
