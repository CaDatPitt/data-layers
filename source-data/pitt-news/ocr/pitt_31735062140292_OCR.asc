The Conservatory of Music in

Juniors Get The Spoon

Annual Ceremony Occurs Before
Spring Vacation — Marshall
and Halleck Make Speeches.

On the morning of March 22d the
annual presentation of the spoon to
the Junior class by the outgoing Sen-
iors took place. J. J. Marshall, for
the class of l9ll,—in a rambling tirade
of the Juniors and all things -con-
cerning them, presented the spoon to
the class of—l9l2. The speech of ac-
ceptance was made by John Halleck,

,who reversed the first speakers re-

marks in favor of the third-year men.
Both addresses were witty and bril-
liant, but -the inclination upon the part
of the’students to resort tolhorseplay
spontaneous humor a largely
marred the oratorical -efforts of_speech
makers. _

The old tradition of the spoon is
a worthy one, but it seems the accom-
panying disorder is entirely out of
place and «should be suppressed to
make the fun really enjoyable.

FARMER IS ELECTED CAPTAIN.

Basketball Player Is Chosen To Lead
Baseball Nine This Year—Was

Homer Farmer, a Senior engineer,
was last week chosen as’ captain of
the university baseball team for the
coming season. The election was held
by the men in college, who were
awarded baseball letters -two years
ago. Farmer is a -capable player of
wide experience and should prove to
be a very successful leader of the var-
sity team.

ments to be Almost Perfect.

Building to Overlook Trees Ath-
letic Field-— Seating Capacity
of New Field to be About
l6,000—Track Fifth of a mile
in Length. . -

Plans for the erection of the Trees’
gymnasium are about complete and
work will be begun on the structure
in a very short time. From theslight
glimpse of the appearance ‘of the
building given by the architect in a
hurried survey, it will be noticed that
the university is to have a gymnasium
second to none in the country. It
will be placed in such a way that the
building will overlook the athletic
ﬁeld, which will be on thecampus fac-

ing west, north of.the School of Med-

icine in the line of Allequippa street.
Following is the architect’s descrip-
tion of the new addition to the uni-

_versity group:

The gymnasium will be an oblong
building 50xlSO feet, and will contain
in the central portion "a swimming
pool and gymnasium, and the two
ends, which are four stories high,.wi1l

contain each, ‘locker rooms, fencing-

rooms, chest weight rooms, physical
examination rooms, boxing rooms,
small club rooms and showers, for
men and women, respectively. The
swimming pool is 30x60 feet, will have
a visitors’ gallery around it, which

will also be used as~an indoor run--

ning track. The gymnasium is 50x80
feet, and will haveone end. a stage,
and at the other end, opening out on
to the gymnasium ﬂoor, will be a
large room which will contain all the
wall equipment for athletic exercise.
The exterior is to be of brick and ter-
ra cotta, to be crowned by cornices
and.to have a ﬂat roof. It will be

thoroughly ventilated, and furnished: _
with the latest and best athletic and

gymnasium equipment.

The field proper will contain a
fifth-mile track, ample room for base-
ball and football, and when the con-

crete seats that surround this field
will have been built, they will accom-~
modate about l6,000 people. ’

. No Classes Friday.
In accordance with the usual cus-
tom there will be no classes heard in
the uni\'e:'sity this coming Friday.

THE RIGHT PLAN.

In another column will be found -a
communication from a former stu-
dent of the university, who ‘takes up

} with special care the problem of ad.-
vertising solicitation by the students

 . of the University of Pittsburgh. The
5 . T writer\has touched the vital point of
P the argument when he suggests that
the student—publications be supported
by the university, .when a deﬁcit be-
tween the subscriptions and the cost
of printing occurs. -The idea is not
.beyond the bounds of accomplish-
ment, as might be thought at the first
glance, because one -dollar taken from
the tuition of each student in the.uni-

i. versity‘ would more than cover the
cost of printing for a publication of
this character. The -day is not far
distant when the_college and uni-
versity administration
must face the fact that advertising
has passed from the charitable state
to T the how-much—can-I-get—for-
my-dollar p_osition.
not a display -of colored ink and a
tasteful arrangement of type; it is the
venture of a -business man to gain
more trade, an-d if the undertaking
be 5 the stamp of results, then most
-‘surely it is proﬁtable. College papers
A ‘are by their very natures limited to
an extremely small cir-cle of readers,
-and must of necessity cater absolute-

Ly’ to their subscribers, which means
that circulation is conﬁned entirely to

A» the students and- friends of the insti-
A ptution. The most optimistic cannot
deny that the average business man,
the one who has real good ‘American’
blood in his veins, does not see the
chance of returns from such condi-
tions. Sentiment and loyalty have
their place in poems and songs, but
[not in advertising—it is a purely com-
mercial proposition. A careful study

of college advertising brings out the
Jfact that the death knell of philan-
thropic contributions to the display

THE PITT WEEKLY

It was not the intention of the
Weekly to conﬁne criticism to the
track programs, reference to which is
made in the letter addressed to the
editor this week. The students are
invited to a careful reading of the ex-
cellent statement of the alumni mem-
ber, which appears in this issue.

"INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY.

The erection of the building on the
campus for the purpose of carrying
out the plans of Professor Duncan in
industrial chemistry indicates a new
era in the history of the university.
The value of research work in the

‘commercial paths of the world is a

comparatively novel thing to the mo-d-
ern mind, but one which possesses
consequences of immeasurable worth.
The scope of the work to be under-
taken in the University of Pittsburgh
has already been outlined in these
columns, and will not need to be re-
peated at this ‘time, because the stu-
?dents are familiar with the task at
hand. It is especially gratifying to
note that the plans are being accom-
panied with action of the proper kin-:7,
and it will be only a few niqmths ‘un-
til the entire scheme of reseflrch work
will be in operation. ‘ The quarters
provided for the new department will
be adequate for the prc;-gent needs of
the irivestigators.

THE GYMNASIUM.

In the news columns of this issue.

appears the first announcernent of
the Trees gymnasium and the plans
for its erection.
University of Pittsburgh are exceed-
ingly fortunate inpossessing such a
temple erected to the perfection oi

‘physical -accomplishments. The, speci-
ﬁcations as outlined in the initial ar-
ticle for publication indicate that the

similar structure of its kind in the
United States. An effort has been
made to make the different depart-
ments of the gymnasium both spacious
and comfortable in the extreme. Mr.
Trees has given a strong arm of up-
lift to the university in this most
splendid vd\onati»on,_an-id it is to be
hoped that the students will make the
most of the opportunity offered to
them by the Trees gymnasium. A

The Junior engineers believe
school-room work much easier than
shop tasks. The co-operative plan
has started.

A firm in South America wanted a
I doctor. They requested one from the
University of Pittsburgh. A star for
South America, please!

The annex to the School of Edn-
cation is a thing of beauty. Now
don’t ask which is the School of Edu-
cation.

Someone has deﬁned the presenta-
tion of the spoon to the Junior class
as a polite rough house. The truth
is certainly evident. A

One rule to avoid becoming con,-
spicuous in the University of Pitts-
burgh——do not attend chapel.

Our Tilxetter Box

To the Editor of The Pitt Weekly:

I have read with a great deal of in-
terest your editorial, entitled “Athletic
Programs,” in the currentissue of the
‘VVeekly, and am glad to note that you
have taken up the matter of the
sale of the program privilege for ath-

letic events_ and fully concur with you‘

in .the stand that you take. The only
objection to and criticism of your ar-
ticle that I have to make is that you
do not go quite far enough. Why
pick out the athletic programs and
make them bear the brunt of the at.

ta-ck when for a handsome percent-

age an advertising concern handles
the Cap and Gown Club’s program
yearly? The Glee Club also pu-blishes
aiprogram, but I conﬁdently believe
that the proceeds of the latter pro-
gram go entirely into the Glee .Club’s
funds and the business transaction is
entirely free from the tainted com-
mercialism of which you complain.
Q0 e.ven further, and state the facts
of the arrangements made by the Pitt
Weekly itself’ with an advertising ﬁrm,
whereby, to quote from your own ar-
ticle, “the back—bone .of aicollege pa-
per” was sold. No-w consider also

' whether or not the advertisers in for-

mer Owls really got their money’s
worth. They bought advertising
space, but I doubt if they got value
for their money——and I feel qualiﬁed
to express an opinion.

Now-that the case has been more
fully stated, let us stop and see what
the solicitation of advertising for the

athletic programs, the Cap and Gown .

program, the Glee Club programs, the
Pitt Weekly and-the Owl means for
the good of the ,university—for the
welfare of ~'~.the‘2un/-iversity is the 4-‘ﬁnal
issue. True, the more advertising that
is gotten for'the various publications,
the better will be the issues, and if
the publications are good, «creditable
publicity will be -given to-the univer-
sity. . But it is a question in my mind
whether For nbt this good publicity
otitweighs the damage that is done
to the university in the solicitation of
advertising for the various publica-
tions, no vmatter even if the solicita-
tion is free from the taint of com-
mercialism, as the ﬁrms who -take
advertising space do it more in the
spirit of a direct donation to the uni-
versity than for the value of the ‘ad-
vettising, and then when the real
legitimate call for support for the uni-
versity itself goes out, these same
ﬁrms or ind-ividuals do not feel like
contributing, for they think that they
have already done something. And
there is justice in the stand they then
take, for some of the firms are seen
and “tapped” for advertising space
not less than six times each year.
Now with this information at hand,

let the Student Senate take the mat-
ter up in its true sense and petition

the Board of Trustees of the univer-
sity and ask that all solicitation -'.on
programs and Weeklies and annuals
be ordered stopped. If the'univer-
sity needs the publicity given to it

by properly arranged and published‘

1

..are .concerned, whatever the '*differ-

rHi«: rrrr WEEKLY

.programs,»wh~ether for athletic, theat-
rical onmusical activities, then let
the university foot the bill.

As far as the Weekly.-and the Owl

ence in the cost of publication and the
total subscription .money amounts to
let the university pay. The Weekly
and the Owl are just as truly uni-
versitypublications as are the Bul-
letin and the Catalogue,.and it would
seem laughable to solicit advertising
on these two latter publications.

Surely at .this stagepof the publica-
tion game, the Weekly and the Owl
know approximately the cost of pub-
lication and the amount of money
available from all sources other than
advertising, and the university should
make an appropriation to cover the
difference. If the university ofﬁcials
think that the publicity to be gained
from properly published programs is
worth the expenditure, then let the
university paythe bills for the pro-
grams, as the Athletic Committee, the
Cap and Gown Club, and the Glee
Club are suliiciently saddled with ex-
pense, and the publicity from their ac-
tivities all len<d prestige to the univer-
sity proper. But it is high time that
the advertisers be given a rest.-

I sincerely trust that you will give
this letter the same publicity that was
given your editorial. You may use
my name if you are so inclined.

Cordially yours,
C. VV. VV. ZIEG, ’l0.

Poor weather has been the cause

a rule have shown an inclination to go
slow during the unfavorable weather.

In the above terse statements there
is a beautiful little story concerning
the recent trip of the class in Social
Economy to the George Junior Re-
public. It seems the price of lodging
and eating in the quaint college town
is like the protective taritf, a little
high. Adhering strictly to the prin-
ciples of economy, three m-en among
the party previously mentioned re-
fused to pay their hotel account and
were given. a merry chase to the rail-
road station by the proprietor of the
city hostelry. The Pitt men prove-d
the proposition, that in speed there is
safety, and managed to elude the out-
raged host. This is a garbled ac-
count of the happening, but if names
were given the fun would not be half

so great, so ask a member of then
' party for full particulars.
