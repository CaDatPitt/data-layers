a safety campaign starting Mon-
day, according to Edwin Ellis, C39,

“We believe that University stu-
dents are careful, cautious drivers,”
claims Ellis, “and they will be
proud to advertise this fact by our
stickers and posters.”

He also feels that the University
should lead other colleges in aiding
the city in the “No-Accident”

Ludlow Bill

Council Accepts
New Amendments

After dismissing the war refer-
endum aniendmeiit bill, intro-
duced in t,.‘m1g'1'es.s by li'.‘pl't"S(?lllil-
tive Ludlow. of Indiana, the Pitt
Peace Council adopted the bill
with few dissenting votes, at‘ a
meeting held Wednesday afternoon,
in the Swedish room. '

As revealed in the thorough dis-
cussion, led by Bernard McKenna,
C39, and Robert Saffron, C39, the
two purposes of the bill are: (1) to
allow citizens of the United States
to vote for or against a war on for-
eign territory; (2) limit the war-
making power of the president, that
is, his control of the army and navy,
and especially his control of foreign
affairs.

These are explained in a pamph-
let, by Saffron, which will be dis-
tributed on campus.

However, Abe Wolovitz, C40, sug-
gested that this bill would weaken
United States as a world power. Dr.
Benjamin H. Williams, professor of
political science, remarked that
United States cannot help being a
world power, regardless of her for-
eign relations.

Further plans for securing sup-
port for the bill were adopted.
Starting Wednesday and lasting un-
til Friday of next week, a campaign
will be conducted on campus by
members of the council, who will
circulate petitions, addressed to
Pennsylvania congressmen, urging
passage of the war referendum
amendment.

A short council meeting will be
held on Tuesday, composed of mem-
bers of the sponsoring committee of

-activities leaders and members of

the Council, to secure petitions and

copies of Saffron’s pamphlet for dis-

tribution on campus.

Members of the sponsoring com-
mittee, and time and place of the
meeting will be announced Monday.

order out of the present international
anarchy.”

“Neutrality is not a practical poli-

éered by the investigating committee
to the SFA executive committee in
closed session last Tuesday after-
noon. The report was released ‘for
publication today.

A summary of the conversations,
which were held on November 22 by
Dr. Weber and the committee, indi-
cates that: _ _

1. The freshmen athletes will be
treated fairly. .

2. Tl1_ere are not and will notbe
athletic scholarships. '_

3. The University's “Code of
Conduct for Athletics” was adopt-
ed to conform to the “general na-
tion-wide trend in the conduct of
college athletics.” '

4. There is no rift between 
Sutherland and the Administration.

5. The provision of permanent
eating facilities will be the next
large undertaking in the Cathedral
and the construction will be started
as soon as money is made available.

6. The use of an adviser to pub-
lications will continue and the
present plan is expected to “work
out satisfactorily.”

Information previously known
concerning the freshman football
misunderstanding was repeated in
the committee report, which stated
that “an adjustment would be made
which would be fair both to the
freshmen and to the University, “if
the freshmen maintained their claims
of misunderstanding the University’s
intentions.

Conﬁrms Statement

Dr. Weber said “that in the fu-
ture there will be no possibility of
misunderstanding.”

Dr. Weber’s statement that there
will be no de—epmhasis, which was
quoted in Wednesday’s News, was
substantiated by his talks to the
committee. He told the committee
that the code was necessary for the
making of schedules with other uni-
versities, that the University in-
tends to “adhere strictly to the pro-
visions of the Code, and that the
University will continue to have
good football teams.

To answer current rumors con-
cerning the Dr. Sutherland-Admin-
istration lift, Dr. Weber referred to
Dr. Bowman’s speech, which was
given before the student body earlier
the day of the interview. Dr. Weber
reafﬁrmed the chancellor’s “complete
denial,” and pointed out that ‘Dr.
Sutherland’s present contract ex-
tends to 1941.

The portion of the report dealing
with the eating facilities stated that
the incomplete plans call for the
ﬁnishing and enlarging of the pres-'
ent space used by the Tuck Shop.

Building Plans

Other facts relevant to the “com-
pletion and extension” of the Uni-
versity are (1) a Women’s gymnasi-
um is planned for the ground floor
of the Cathedral; (2) a student union
building on Frick Acres is “still far
in the future,” and that restricted use
of Foster Memorial is necessary in
order to be “in harmony with the
purpose of the building.”

Both Dr. Weber and the SFA com-
mittee members agreed that the pres-
ent plan of supervision of publica-
tions “has not been in operation long
enough to be judged fairly.”

Plans for a committee to meet with
administration officials were formu-
lated at the “one less than quorum”
meeting of SFA, which was held
on November 15.

The committee, appointed by John
Downie, BA39, president of SFA and
chairman of the committee, consist-
ed of Ray Dimit, M40; Gene Taano,
D39; Bob Adams, C40; Mary, Gr-egg,
C40, and Patricia Elmer, Ed40.

The next assembly meeting, which
is open to the student body, is sched-
u‘er.l for December 13.

Student Teachers
All those expecting to enroll for
student teaching the second semes-
+m-. nnd who have not made appli-
lation should do so immediately.
Application forms may be obtained
in 2030 Cathedral, according ‘to Dr.
George Gould, director of student
teaching.

“Good Eartli” Brought Award

Although Pearl Buck has written many short stories,-

essays, novels. and biographies of late, it was probably
her first novel “The Good Earth,” that inﬂuenced the
Swedish Academy of Stockholm.

_ _ It was Miss Buck’s knowledge of Chinese life, plus
-her somewhat new point of view that the Oriental cul-
t‘urc did not need transformation by missionaries that
7.-ittractcd so much interest. Many people were sur-

l1'i§1'ised and even shocked to learn that the Chinese had
a philosophy of life in many ways superior to ours.

‘According to Mr. Mayer, assistant professor of Eng-
ljsh, Miss Buck cannot even be considered a good sec-

,ond-rate writer. Commenting on her style, he said,
“She writes skillfully and professionally, but she lacks

.:a certain distinction necessary to a really good author.”

Quaintness Due To Bible

4, .Miss Buck explains the quaintness of her style in
“The Good Earth" as probably due to the influence of
the King James version of the Bible which her mis-
_si0nary father used to read aloud to his family and, in
2.1 lesser degree, her t'amilia1‘ity with the Chinese lan-
guage.

The fact that the Nobel prize has come to America
for the third time has real signiﬁcance. Perhaps the
judges honored Miss Buck not so much for her literary
talient as for recognition of American literature in gen-
eral. It is only in the last few decades with the awards
to Sinclair Lewis and Eugene O’Neill that the continent
has been aware that America has a literature of its
own".

Previo=.'vsly, the output from the New World was con-
sidered unworthy of serious consideration or a bad imi-
tation of European models. If the award to Miss Buck
'is_ symbolic of growing intelligent appreciation of
Ameican literature, it has served its purpose.

Dr. VVeber's announcement that improved eat-

supplement the the present inadequate Tuck shop,
was welcome to us who have so long -;leplored the

ent lack of facilities iii the building.

news to campils organizations who have had to
either take their functions to outside locations or

‘will. be anxiously awaited. But they should really
be construed as temporary expedients, instituted
due to the present ﬁnancial inability to provide the
needed facilities for student activities and social

‘gnditor, Pitt News, .

‘5 As a representative member of E
the student body and also as a sen-
ior manager of the football team,

lto the very unappropriate publicity \_
tthat members of our varsity and?
:freshman football teams have beeni
‘greceiving recently.

ithis university a “bad name.” I}
"agree to that. Our university Sis,i_
without doubt, receiving publicity
that does not add to the prestige ‘of
a higher institution of learning.

But what about the publicity that
those innocent freshman football
players are receiving? Do you think
that they are deserving of such pu-
blicity because of certain admin-
istrational blunders? I sincerely
feel that they should be defended“
with regard to this. After all, those
boys are merely asking for a col-
lege education, which they have been
promised. There is absolutely no
other profit motive involved.

As for the varsity football men,
this‘ present athletic situation can
not help but reflect on them. If
you know Goldberg, Stebbins,
Chickerneo, Lezouski, and the others
as I do, you will readily agree that
such fine students and athletes are
very undeserving of such black pu-
blicity, thattheir fraternal organiza-
tion, the football squad, is receiv-
mg.

I honestly believe that somebody
owes an apology for such publicity,
and I am positive that it is not the
members of the football squad who
do.

Sincerely, ,

Friend Legion Argues
War Referendum

By Robert Saffron

My old friend, whose name is Le-
gion, has indicated in advance that
he will not sign a petition asking for
the passage of a war referendum.

I pointed out that now is the
time for us potential cannon fodder
to insist on a chance to say “No”

1 for the war drums are beating once
more; the administration in Wash-
ington views with alarm the lack
of teeth in our neutrality act and
a fascist invasion in South America
and‘ the _possibility of Eskimo
threats from the North. ’

By Jane Epping and Mercedes Shiring

The amendment
that, except in the case of invasion of
continental United States or its pos-
sessions, Congress would not declare
war until after a nation-wide refer-
endum.

No. 1 hideout honors of the past Dismal Durham
week-end go to Sportsman Len “Lover” Levison . .
He arrived, by the stout eﬁorts of his thumb and for
the return trip stowed away in a bunk on the Pitt spe-
cial, carrying the team . . The order"‘Stay Out, one
of the Pitt tackles is suffering terriﬁc pain in there and
can’t be disturbed” protected Lenny, no relation to the
“Of Mice and ’Men” character .

That is until Walter “Stooge” Good poked an ever-
inquiring nose into the car . . Payment of train fare
was promptly demanded and Lenny was just about to
leave his watch in lieu of debt, when up stepped a dele-
gation of Pitt blockers—Petro, Merkovsky, Dannies, and
Chickerneo—which led interference for Lenny off the
train and into the safety of the station lobby .

And anyhow, Good—old fellow, Len had his rights.
He was taking the place of Dick Fullerton, reserve cen-
ter who didn't make the return trip——hopping up to
Wash. D. C. to visit his parents .

“It is futile,” said Legion. “Con-
gress declares war because of pop-
ular pressure and war fever.”

This is not exactly true. The Pres-
ident, by his conduct of foreign af-
fairs, threatening notes and procla-
mations, can create .a situation which
forces Congress to comply when he
asks for war. This is what happened
in 1917. _ . , ,

Popular support came after the
dcciaration; it was helped by the
song-and-dance spread by George
Creel. The only authentic public
opinion at the time was recorded
by Representative J. Hamilton
Moore. who queried his constitu-
ency informally before he voted in
Congress. His district was eleven
to one against America’s entry.

“But,” Legion came back, “this is
a bad bill because it would (1) crip-
ple the president in his conduct of
foreign affairs; (2) it would en-
courage other nations to think they
could violate American rights with
impunity.”

To the first charge, my rejoinder
was: “Good!” Diplomatic rela-
tions as carried on by the presi-

. dent, mainly without the advice of
A Congress, are simply power poli-
tics, bluff and threats. This card
game (with private lives as chips)
is called “American Rights.”

American rights abroad are actual-
ly private persons’ rights: private in-
vestments, private properties, private
ships carrying supplies to combatants
these are the hazy national rights
for which Americans have died in
the past.

The president, therefore, would
be careful in blufﬁng and raising
when he is not certain that the peo-
ple would support him if he should

, be called to show.

1 “But the people are just dumb
ienough to vote for war when the
; propaganda hits them.”

3 Possibly. But when they real-

thev will be less subject to the
pressure of loud minorities and the
hope of ﬁnancial gain than Con-
gress will be.

It has been said that, had all the

First Practices Scheduled Monday
For Volley Ball, Gymnastic Teams

Following the plan used in the de-%

velopment of a varsity soccer team,
the Athletic Department will or-
ganize varsity gnmastic and volley-
ball teams with the ﬁrst practices
slated for Monday.

The gymnastic coach will be Karl
Oermann, instructor in the freshman
sports program and a member of the
intramural staff. Practices will be
conducted _for several weeks until
Oermann determines the extent of
his ‘material, after which a schedule
will be arranged. All men interested
should report at Trees Gymnasium
at 4 o’clock ‘Monday.

Inter-Squad Games

. Charles Radi, also of the intramu-
ral staff, will hold the ﬁrst practice
of his volleyball team at Trees Gym
on Monday at 5 o’clock. Asin soc-
cer, the boys will hold inter-squad
games until a deﬁnite varsity has
been selected.

In addition tothe formation of the
two varsities , a life saving and
s_v_vimming program will be conduct-
ed with Red Crossglife saving cer-
tiﬁcates as the ultimate goal. Oer-
mann will instruct all those interest-
ed in the program, and will hold his
ﬁrst meeting in Trees Gym at 4:80
Monday.

While soccer, volleyball, and life
saving are of prime importance at
present, plans for the regular Intra-
mural Winter Program go on undis-
turbed. Competition in, all three
leagues begins on Wednesday, De-
cember 7.

Each of the thirteen social frater-
nities has entered a team in the Fra-
ternity League, and will participate
in all of the ﬁve sports, basketball,
xandball, bowling, ‘table tennis, and
volleyball. Fraternities are remind-
ed that one man may play in no more
than two sports per season.

Joining the national pastime. of

largely responsible for consistent
gains by the Mets. . - I -
Park “At ‘Full
Teamed at the halfbacks are Larry
Katz of Pi Lambda Phi and lAlAck-‘
enhcil, one-man ball club, of the
Civil Engineers. Katz topped all
scorers in the Fraternity League by
tallying five touchdowns in four
games. Ackenheil captained the
CE’s, ran, passed, kicked, and wound
up the season with 24 of his club’s
31 points. I '
The fullback spot goes to Paul
Park of Phi Delta Theta. Not a
ﬂashy player, Park’s consistency still
played a major role in the Phi Delts’
march to the intramural champion-
ship. His ability as a pass receiver
resulted in the scoring and setting up
01' touchdowns which otherwise
might not have been forthcoming.
Ends on the “dream team” are Lar-
ry Smith of the Phi Delts and Harry
Holt of Delta Tau Delta. Oﬁensively
and defensively, Smith fulﬁlled all
requirements of an ace ﬂanker, while
Holt, former Shadyside Academy star,
was a familiar ﬁgure in opposing
backﬁelds.
Dimit On Again
Ray Dimit, Phi Gamma Delta, and
Paul Ashman, Metallurgists, perform
at the tackle spots. Ashman, re-

teams are entered in all of the sports.
Any team which was unable to get
an entry blank into the Intramural
Oﬁice before November 23 may still
compete in the winter program if
its entry is received by Tuesday of
next week.
Engineers Ready

Six clubs are already listed in the
Engineering League. The Metallurg-
ists, touch football champs, are out
for new honors, while the Civil En-
gineers the Electrical Engineers, the
Chemical Engineers, the Industrial
Engineers, and the Oil and Gas out-
iii are set to stop the Mets.

Newman Club heads the Indepen-
dent League entries followed by the
Ramblers, the Bunnies, the Pitt Club,

the YMCA, and the Danes. At least
two more clubs are expected to en-
ter the Independent and Engineering
circuits.

Because of frequent interruptions
in the schedule, it will be neces-
sary to use the time available to the
utmost in order to complete the pro-
gram. Competition will begin at 3
o’clock in the afternoon, and con-
tinue until 10 o’clock.

Volleyball, handball, table tennis,
and basketball will have Trees Gym-
nasium as the locale for matches, al-
though -some basketball games will

’ be played in the Stadium. All bowl-

ing matches will be run off in the
Strand Bowling Alleys on Forbes
Street.

Pitt Skaters Tie
John Carrol, 2-2

Playing hockey that at times
sparkled with championship possi-
bilities and at others looked like a
back alley shinny game, the Pitt

icers were ‘held to a 2-2 tie by a ‘

star studded John Carrol outfit. To-
morrow night the Panther
again takes the ice, this time against
the Duquesne "university team.

Last year Pitt split the league
meetings with the Dukes, but beat
them out in the Eastern Division
playoffs.” '

The_ Bluffites took the newly

formed Panther team in their first
game of the season and adminis-
tered a decided 3-1 beating. Inex-
perience -and lack of training marked

_. II. BUILDING PROGRAM

 venient smoking rooms and lounges,

and that many phases of this pol-
icy have in the past been explained
either incompletely or not at all.
The committee believes that if the
aims of lfniversity policy were
better explained, the student body
would have a better understand-
ing of the problems which Univer-
sity officials must face, and a
greater feeling of conﬁdence in
the administration.

Acting on suggestions given by
Assembly members at the Novem-
ber 15 meeting, the committee de-
cided to attempt to obtain infor-
mation on University policy, per-
taining to student life, particu-
larly as it affects athletics, the
biiilding program, and the student -
publications.

Following is an outline of the
points which the committee dc-
cided to discuss witli a representa-
tive of the administration:

I. ATHLETIC PROGRAIVI

A. The case of the freshman foot-
ball players, and their receipt of
bills for tuition after a. member
of the Athletic Department al-
legedly told them that the
promissory notes which they
signed would not be collected.

VVhile the facts of the case
have probably become confused
in the heat of the controversy,
the committee decided to con-
vey to the administration the
general feeling of‘ the student
body that the freshmen had just
cause for complaint, and the
hope that an adjustment could
be reached which would be fair
to the players and satisfactory
to the University.
The reasons for the adoption of
the Code for the Conduct of
Athletics, commonly known as
the “Code Bowman.”

The committee believed that
the Code, which was instru-
mental in causing the present
crisis, should be explained, since
many students evidently do not
understand the reasons for the
adoption of the Code and the
de-emphasis of athletics.
Student interest in the relation-
ship between the administration
and Dr. John B. Sutherland as
head football coach.

The committee felt that this
point should be discussed along
with the freshman incident and
the “Code Bowman” in order to
gain a. more complete under-
standing of the athletic situa-
tion.

A‘ The _comniittee decided to discuss
the need for better eating facili-
ties in_ the Cathedral, more con-

reasons for the restricted use of
Foster Memorial, and to inquire
into the possibilities of better pro-
vision for social activities, and for
a student union building.
III. PUBLICATIONS

The committee decided to ask the
administration representative for
an explanation of the reasons for
adopting the new policy of super-
vision of the student publications.
The committee realized that Dr.
John Weber, Secretary of the Uni-
versity, had announced the adop-
tion of this system to the members
of the Student-Faculty at its first
meeting this year, but believed that
a further statement by him would
serve to answer the questions of
students interested.

The committee met with Dr. John
Weber, Secretary of the University,
on Tuesday, November 22 to discuss
these problems. Following is a sum-
mary of the points brought out dur-
ing the Committee’s conversation with
Dr. Weber:

I. ATHLETIC PROGRAM

Dr. Weber declared that the Uni-
versity had no intention of dealing
unfairly with the freshman athletes.
He pointed out that the Wording of
the papers signed by the athletes at

-taking begun in the Cathedral.

the same basis as other schools in
their regulation of athletics. In fact,
the code was not-actually written at
Pitt, but is‘ a verbatim copy of some
of the codes in use in the eastern and
mid—western schools.

Regarding the relationship be-
tween the University administrators
and Dr. Sutherland, Dr. Weber re-
ferred to Chancellor Bowman’s speech
to the student body. He reafﬁrmed
Dr. Bowman’s complete denial that
the administration is in any way dis-
satisﬁed with Dr. Sutherland. He
stated that he joined with the stu-
dent body in the hope that Dr. Suth-
erland would remain with the Uni-
versity for many more years. He
also stated that Dr. Sutherland’s
present contract extends to 1941. The
‘current rumors about strained rela-
tions between the administration and
Dr. Sutherland have been spread by
parties who have no official connec-
tion with the University, and the sit-
uation has been complicated by peo-
ple who have no knowledge of the
facts, declared Dr. Weber. He added
his hope that the student body would
discount such rumors and have more
faith in the good intentions of the
University administrators. A
II. BUILDING PROGRAM
The University’s building program,
as Dr. Weber explained to the SFA
Assembly earlier in the year, can be
pushed forward only as money for
construction is made available. Such
funds are not included in the Univer-
sity’s regular budget, and the Cathe-
dral of Learning can be ﬁnished and
other improvements made only as
gifts to the University are received.
The committee pointed out to Dr.
Weber the pressing need for im-
proved eating facilities in the Cathe-
dral, emphasizing that students were
especially anxious that action be
taken on this problem before other
important improvements are made in
the Cathedral.

Dr. Weber reported that a perma-
nent eating place to replace the Tuck
Shop would be the next large under-
It
would probably be the completion
and extension of the present space
used by the Tuck Shop. He was un-
able to name a deﬁnite date for the
beginning of the work, because of
the need of completing plans. In the
meantime, steps will be taken to im-
prove the Tuck Shop and to satisfy

Commenting on the restricted use
of the Foster Memorial, Dr. Weber
explained that it is important that
the use of the Memorial be in har-
mony with the purpose of the build-
ing. Another factor which compli-
cates the problem of assigning the
Memorial to student groups is the
calendar for use of the building,
which is made out far in advance.

The possibility of a student union
biulding on Frick Acres which would
provide adequate facilities for stu-
dent activities was discussed, but it
was agreed that such a building is
still far in the future. Cost of an
adequate studentunion would be 11,é
to 21/; million dollars.

The Committee explained that stu-
dents do not intend to be critical of
the University’s building. program,
but that they do feel that serious
practical needs for an eating place,
smoking rooms, lounges, and other
facilities should be met before other
improvements are made which are
not so vitally necessary at this time.

III. PUBLICATIONS

At the ﬁrst meeting of the SFA As-
sembly, when Dr. Weber announced
the plan of employing a full-time ad-
visor to the student publications, he
explained that this action places the
publications on the same basis as
other student activities, with an ad-
visor prepared to give his full ‘time
to organizing and advising the work
of the students.

When the appointment of Mr. Rob-
ert Machesney as advisor to the pub-
lications was_ announced in Septem-
ber, it was explained in The Pitt
News that “Mr. Machesney plans to
organize the student publications on
a basis that will make them as far as
possible representative of the whole
student body and a credit to the Uni-
versity, and also afford training to
the students of the University who
are interested in reporting and writ-
ing for the publications.” .

It was generally "agreed that the
present plan of supervision has not
been in operation long enough to be
judged fairly. Dr.» Weber feels, that,
with the cooperation of the students,
the present plan will work out satis-
factorily.
