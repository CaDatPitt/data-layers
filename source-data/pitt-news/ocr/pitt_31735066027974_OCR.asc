Campus reaction helps police
Shooting suspects to be tried for attempted murder

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief '

With the help of a few compassionate

Pitt students, police were able to arrest.
three suspects in the shooting of a student

last month. ’ ‘

Three Pitt students wrote letters to local
newspapers, including The Pitt News and
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, asking _people
notto forget Kevin Cecil. - i

A day after publication of the letters, on
Aug. 17, Pittsburgh City Police arrested
two juveniles and one adult,~Robert
Bledsoe, of the North Side. Pittsburgh
Assistant District Attorney Cynthia

Franklin said she would _try tocharge the
two juveniles, ages 13 and 17, as adults,
and all of the suspects would be charged

, with attempted murder. The suspect

accused of pulling the trigger in the shoot-
ing had just tumed 13, according to Pitt
Police.

Cecil, 21, was walking a woman home to
Webster Hall on Dithridge Street and Fifth

Avenue the night of July 13. The couple .

heard, a noise behind them as the female
was putting the key in her door. A bullet
was fired, hitting Cecil in the back and sev-
ering his spinal cord. Doctors_have said
Cecil will be a quadriplegic for life and
will never walk again. -

Monday, the two juvenile suspects
appeared i ‘ Allegheny County Court and
the judge s" id he would consider having .
the suspects tried as adults. A final deci-
sion will be m de at a hearing. on Sept. 18.

Since the s oting, some Pitt students.
including Cqcil’s roommate Mike
Sofranko, have ‘worked hard to make the
entire Pitt community aware of the shoot-
1ng.

In late July, Sofranko organized a meet-
ing at which the Pitt police chief, the vice
chancellor for student and public affairs
and the director of parking and transporta-
tion were present. Concerned Pitt students.

Buying _books is not an
option. You have to do it to
complete almost any class at
Pitt, -

to buy them, and information
on how to keep_book_s safe
from theft. '

Presently, the two local and
credible places to purchase
textbooks are the University
Book Center at Schenley
Quad and the Campus
Bookstore on Forbes
Avenue. '

Mike Chizmar, owner of
the Campus Bookstore, says
competition between the two
bookstores benefits the stu-
dents. *

“There is a lot of education
for students that takes place
out of the classroom, and one
of the things they have to
learn is to compare prices
and buy where -they feel
comfortable.” Chizmar said.

‘However. the Pitt commu-
nity offers a choice of where-

Buying your books

Chizmar opened_ the
Campus Bookstore in
November of 1993. Though
the opening of his store
caused some concern
because of competition, stu-
dent popularity has estab-
lished him as a fixture in the
community.

“Generally, everyone at
Pitt, has settled down about
us. We are a part of the com-
munity and have a value to
the university,” Chizmar

- said.

Jim Crowley, operations
manager at the University
Book Center, acknowledges

Chizmar’s presence but-

affirms that the University
Book Center _has the respon-
sibility to stock all needed
textbooks for all non-medical

 ‘Pitt classes.

“_‘We are responsible for a
total order of all necessary
textbooks for every class,”
Crowley said. “We cannot

Pitt begins a new season with interim
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg. .

Earlier in the week Nordenberg
announced that certain offices, including
media relations and institutional research,
will now fall directly under the chancellor's
office. In addition, he has brought two
assistants —— one a Pitt employee, the other
a former Pitt worker + onto his team for
the transition period. —

Appearing to be left out of the loop are
Leon Haley and Ben Tuchi, two administra-
tors brought in by ex-chancellor O’Connor.
Haley is currently the vice chancellor for
student and public affairs, and Tuchi is the
seniorvice chancellor for business and

Haley has been under some criticism for
the past year, since taking over the office of
both public and student affairs. Many insid-
ers and outsiders at Pitt felt that combining
the two offices presented a conﬂict of inter-
est. Haley’s predecessor, William Harmon,
was only responsible for student affairs.

.“I am going to spend more time with stu-
dent affairs,” Haley said about his new
role. '

Haley also recently moved from his spa-
cious office in the Cathedral of Learning to
one in the William Pitt Union. He is now
amongst other student activity officials,
such as Dennis Donham and Joe Cavalla.

“There is a great opportunity to further
expand and improve the quality of life on

_the Pitt campus,” added Haley.

Nordenberg could not be reached for
comment on Haley or Tuchi,.because he

Robert often not nearly as difficult as the
Gallagher psychological aspects of separa~
'—'.-''-'':'’'''tion from one’s family. Separating
psychologically, i;e., establishing your own identity,
is a difficult process that begins in early childhood
and continues long beyond the college years.

I The drive for separation and individuation is most
pronounced in the adolescent years when teenagers
explore many ways of differentiating themselves
from their parents. In the minds of most adolescents,
the process is complete when they leave the house-
hold to head out for college. Many, of course, find
the process not quite finished when they arrive at

- college, because college poses a whole new set of
challenges.

Some students make the transition to college fairly
easily. They may have been at odds with their parents
during high school andfind the separation from them
a welcome and needed respite. Others have a hard
time leaving the familiar setting of home, and their
feelings of uneasiness in the new setting make it dif-
ficult for them to initially participate in university
life. Still others make the break in dramatic fashion
by escaping into a flurry of activities, party going
and romantic involvements.

All of these students are struggling, in different
ways, to find answers to those universal questions:
“Who am 1?,” “Where do I fit in the world?,” “What
do I believe in?,” and “can I stand on my own?” In
order to separate psychologically from the powerful
influences of the past, we need to understand what

ry, Fort Pitt also covers gener-
al history of the city.

On the North Side, The
Mattress Factory is a contem-
porary art museum that _spe—
cializes in site-specific specta-
cle installation art.

In this approach, an artist is
given a space to create what-
ever they want.

“This allows viewers to be
surrounded by an artist’s work
instead of going to a gallery
and viewing a different piece
every three or four feet,” said
Sarah Niles

The Mattress Factory is
located in a six-story ware-
house that used to be a real
factory. It became a popular
meeting place for area artists.
and when the museum
opened, the name stuck.

In addition to the permanent
collection, the Mattress
Factory also has a residency
‘program where artists come
here to live for a period with-
out prior knowledge of what
to create.

Alleged sexual assault victim files lawsuit
' A 19-year-old Pitt student who alleged

'0 _.__that she was sexually assaulted at a fraternity
A‘ party last September filed a lawsuit against Pitt
. . and the three fraternities involved.

The woman attended a party at the Phi

Delta (FIJI) fraternity house and consent-

ed to sexual relations with one man. But she

alleged that several others broke into the room and
sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated.

Pitt took disciplinary action after adminis-

trators reviewed the incident, placing the fraterni-

. ties on social probation and requiring them to do

community service. Besides FIJI, the other frater-
nities at the party were Sigma Chi and Delta Tau
Delta. ‘

Pitt administrators said they could not
comment on the lawsuit since it was in the middle

Detre successor search put on hold .
The search for the next senior vice chan-
cellor for health sciences was puton hold and will
not resume until a permanent chancellor is found.
The senior vice chancellor for health sci-
ences works very closely with the chancellor,
overseeing the sciences of medicine, dental medi-
cine, public health, rehabilitation and pharmacy at
the university. Currently held by Thomas Detre,
the position is the highest paidand second-most
powerful at Pitt. .
Since Detre announced his resignation in

1992, Pitt ‘has formed two search committees and
spent at least $50,000 to find a successor. The first
committee disbanded after the finalist took anoth-
er job. Faculty members have speculated that the
job may be difficult to fill because the position is
also subordinate to Jeffrey Romoff, president of
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

“The incoming person would need to
know they are in full control of the medical
school,” former University Senate President James
Holland told The Pitt News in May.

was prompted by pressure
from key board of trustees
members. including incom-
ing chair J.W. Connolly.
Board members said that
O’Connor’s “lame-duck sta-
tus” may have also influ-
enced his decision.

O’Connor said he
would take a four-month
academic leave and one-year
sabbatical. then will consid-
er returning to Pitt as a pro-
fessor of biology in 1997.
Former law school Dean
Mark Nordenberg was
appointed by the board of
trustees as interim chancel-
lor.

Board approves tuition
increase

To compensate for
disappointing enrollment

’ figures, budget and finance

administrators proposed a
4.5 percent tuition increase.
The increase was
approved by the board of
trustees in June and goes
into effect this semester. It
will raise the full—year
tuition for full-time. in-state
undergraduates by $220 to
$5,184, and for full-time.
out—of-state undergraduates
from $10,786 to $11,270.

Board approves severance
package for O’Connor

Faculty and students
expressed dissatisfaction
with parts of the compensa-
tion package approved by
the board of trustees for
O’Connor. It included
tenured professor status with
a $180,000 yearly salary if
O’Connor were to decide to
return to Pitt to teach biolo-
gy in 1997.

Director. 1‘ \of

Communications Ken
Service told The Pitt News
that the salary was “com—
mensurate with standard aca-
demic practice,” but former

University Senate President‘

James Holland said it was an
outrageous amount; espe-
cially within the context of
Pitt’s tight_ budget. The
salary is about $100,000
more than the average salary
of professors in”the natural
sciences department.
Overall, O’Connor
was promised an exit pay of
$313,792, basedion a four-
month academic leave. and a
one-year sabbatical.
O’Connor will be paid that
sum over the next 16 months

Dr. Detre will stay

Detre announced he
will stay at least one more
year as senior ‘vice chancel-
lor for the health sciences
while receiving administra-
tive help from James
Herndon, who was appoint-
ed as associate vice chancel-
lor for the health sciences
and vice-president of
UPMC.

University Senate
President Keith McDuffie
said he was concerned that,
Herndon was being groomed
to replace Detre. That would
ignore the democratic prin-
ciples of allowing a search
committee to seek the best
candidate to replace Detre.
McDuffie said it would have
made more sense to appoint
an interim senior vice chan-
cellor because many faculty
members are ready for a
change.

However, Leon
Haley, ‘ vice chancellor
for student- and public
tr affairs,“ defended the

' new arrangement when he
said that because of it, Pitt
will be able to take advan-
tage of Detre’s vast experi-
ence and knowledge for
another year.

The Senator John Heinz

be opening in April of 1996.
The Center will offer a, com-
prehensive history of Western
Pennsylvania.

This project of the
Historical Society of Western

300—seat theater, a discovery
hall for children and a world-
class research center and

The Historical Society also

Presently, the facility is only

A famous architectural and
cultural museum and exhibit
is Fallingwater, located south-
east of Pittsburgh.

Designed by Frank Lloyd
Wright, Fallingwater is the
preserved home of the
Kaufmann family, owners of -
Kaufmann department stores.

The most striking feature of

this architectural wonder is
the house is cantilevered over
a waterfall, meaning that the
terraces hang over the water
with no visible means of sup-
port. . _
“The art and home of the
Kaufmann family has been
preserved so that it is intact as
when the Kaufmann’s lived
here,” said K. Hauger from
the reservations department at
Fallingwater.

Hauger said that along with
the architecture and art, the
home itself is’ of great cultural
value and importance to this

what the Campus Bookstore
might sell.”

Though Crowley knows that
the University Book Center is
still the main outlet for univer-
sity textbooks, he agrees with
Chizmar that competition is
good for the students and
community.

. “The presence of the
Campus Bookstore in our
community is good,” Crowley
said. “Students need to look at

’ all competition to see if they

can save.”

” In a sample price compari-
son between the two stores,
the Campus Bookstore offered
savingson all compared texts

' with a difference ranging from

thirty cents to five dollars. The

compared textbooks were all

used texts. ‘
However; the Campus

I 4 "Bookstore does not carry grad-

uate level or foreign books.

' Those texts need to be pur-

chased from the University
Book Center or checked out at
the library if on reserve.

_ When purchasing textbooks a
at the University Book Center,

students take their registration
form "or syllabus downstairs
and find their own books.
Crowley said there are over 14
assistants available to help in
locating texts.

At the Campus Bookstore, a
buyer takes their registration
form to the attendant who

. goes into the basement and

retrieves the books. This elim-

. inates confusion for new stu- f

dents and can also save valu-
able time.

“With an experienced sales-
man, we can retrieve all avail-
able books in five minutes,”
Chizmar said. “Last term, I
think the longest anyone wait-
ed for books was fifteen min-
utes.”

An informal survey of Pitt
students revealed that the short
wait for books has drawn
many to buy their books at the

' Campus Bookstore.

Sophomore Mike Rummel
\purchased books at the
University Book Center his
first term, but since then he
has bought from the Campus
Bookstore.

“The Campus store is cheap-
er and easier to get books at.
You give them the paper and
they get the books for you.”
Rummel said. "

Sophomore Erin Goodreau
also buys books at the Campus
Bookstore.

“The lines aren’t as big there
so you can_get books faster.
They’re usually less expen-
sive, but on some new text-
books they don’t always have
what you need,” Goodreau
said.

But because the Book

' Center is closer to the heart of

the Pitt campus, and since it is

required to have all the text- .

books needed, some students
will pay the extra money to
buy at the Campus Bookstore.
“Everyone wants a good
price, but you have to get
books where and when it is
convenient,” said Tammy

Harp, a biochemistry major
who has used the Book Center
since 1988.

Harp also said that she buys
from the.University Book
Center because she is used to
going to that location.

To offset the cost of buying
textbooks, students can also
sell their books back at both
the University Book Center or
the Campus Bookstore.

But since you will get con-
siderably less than what you
paid for, if anything at all, you
should consider whether it is
worth selling.

_“If the student is selling a
book that we need, we will try

and pay half of retail if we are
not overstocked,” Crowley
said.

“Sometimes books are used
one term then not used the
next." In that case we tell the
student to hold on to the book
to see if they can sell it in
another term,” Chizmar said.

Chizmar says that he sells
his books at a lower price

‘because he has four sources to

buy from, and because he does
not have a theft problem;
“Since the sales staff are the
only people who have access
to the books until they are
sold, we have eliminated
almost all theft,” Chizmar

said. We don’t lose money that

way and we convert it into
"savings for the students.”
Chizmar and Crowley both
maintain that textbook theft is
a major concern and that stu-

dents need to mark their books

in an inconspicuous place. By
doing this, if the books are
stolen and then brought back
to the store to be resold, the
thieves can be caught.

Crowley said that students
need to report.all textbook
thefts to the Pitt Police imme-
diately so that if the perpetra-
tor is caught, charges can be
filed.

Dave Daniels, book buyer at

Schenley Quad, has been buy-
ing textbooks back from stu-
dents for over eight years.
Though books are usually
bought back at a price much
less than what they were sold
for, he pays full national mar-
ket value. ‘

“The only person that peo-.
ple hate more than me is the
person that gives them parking
tickets,” Daniels joked.

Daniels also guides students
to otheroptions of selling their
textbooks, like selling them to
other students if they are not
happy with the purchase price.

He also is the person that

some of whom did not even
know Cecil, also attended.

Sofranko discussed how
important he felt it was for peo-
ple not to forget about his
roommate. He also wanted to
make sure that students who
were away for the summer, and
new students, were aware of
the shooting.

One of the students who
wrote a letter to the newspa-
pers, Kathleen Delaney, had
never met Cecil.

“It really hit me. It made. me
angry.” she said. “I live a few
blocks away, and my roommate

. was walking home that night.”

. Pitt administrators said they

were happy with the concern
and support shown after the
shooting. .

“I thought it was expected

from Pitt students,” said Leon
Haley, the vice chancellor for
student and public affairs. “I
was delighted and satisfied to
see the reaction.”

“It’s a rare occurrence when

someone gets assaulted or shot
and a town meeting is called,”
said Pitt Police Chief Rick
Boyd. “It is a healthy sign for
Pitt that this ‘reaction came
about”

“Everyone identified with

the ball rolling on the arrest,”
said Dennis Donham, assistant
director for student activities.

Boyd said he was very proud
of the work his officers put into
the investigation, but the peo-
ple who deserve the accolades
are the detectives at the Major
Crimes Unit at the Pittsburgh
City Police Department.

The detectives who had fol-
lowed up on the tip that led
to the arrest were just finish-
ing a shift and thought about

- waiting until the next day.

However, the detective's
resiliency and dedication was a
key factor in the arrest, accord-

_ ing to Boyd.

sometimes has to confront
would-be thieves that try and
illegally sell stolen books.

Without telling Daniels who
he was, a reporter from The
Pitt News approached Daniels
with two textbooks. One was
purchased.for $25 at the Book
Center three months, prior.
Daniels offered $6 to buy it
back.

The other text was a brand
new book that was going to be
used for the first time in the
fall. There was no reason to
re—sell this book because it
could have been returned to
the Book Center for a full

5‘ I99? Alt\"T

refund, but only with a receipt
and an add/drop form.
A book thief would not have

this kind of proof and might

try other ways of getting
money for the book. So the
buyer should suspect that the
new book had been stolen.

Daniels asked for the
reporter’s Pitt ID. He then
took three steps back and
asked him why he was trying
to sell a brand new textbook.

“The next step was for me
to c-all the police,” Daniels
said after being told that the
person was a Pitt News
reporter.

Daniels reiterated what
Crowley and Chiz_mar said
about marking textbooks and
reporting incidents. He said
students should mark their
books with their name on the
page number that matches the
last two digits of their social
security number.

“That way you won’t forget
what page you put it on, and
after the book is reported
stolen I can look for it,”
Daniels said. '

Chizmar said he also looks
for stolen textbooks if they are
marked and reported to police.

“People ‘don’t believe we
check the books but we do,”
he said.

Haley

°From page I A
was in Johnstown earlier in
the week.

With regard to Tuchi.
Nordenberg wrote in a letter
to the university community
that “the elimination of over-
sight responsibility will have
the added benefit of enabling
[Tuchi] to ‘devote even more
time and attention to matters
more directly related to busi-
ness and finance.”

The two people brought to
Pitt by Nordenberg will both
serve on an interim basis.
Jerome Cochran worked at
Pitt for 17 years until he
earned his law degree in
1989 and moved on to a
downtown Pittsburgh law
firm. Among the roles
Cochran served at Pitt were
interim dean of the School of
Pharmacy and assistant
senior vice president for the
health sciences. He will act
as the assistant chancellor.

Vijai Singh, a professor of
sociology in the Graduate
School of Public and
International Affairs will
serve as associate chancellor.
He will give up his current
position as director of the
University Center for Social
and Urban Research to assist
Nordenberg.

“I think my role will
involve different activities.
This is a new role, and it will
be an evolving process.” said
Singh. who will take office
on Sept. 1.

In the letter. dated Aug. 25.
Nordenberg wrote that these
“organizational changesvwill
better position us to achieve
the university’s important
academic goals."

Smokethem if You Got ‘em

nother
Robert -Abattle
Chesnavich i s
underway in
Washington. This one comes
straight from the commander
in chief, as Clinton has asked,
the FDA to highly regulate the
tobacco industry in order to
combat teenage smoking. The
regulations that he is asking
for have been countered by a
lawsuit from Philip Morris
and R.J. Reynolds, the two
major American tobacco prod-
uct-makers. ‘

The tobacco companies
have always walked ‘a fine line
between giving in to govem-
ment demands when it seemed
to their at-most minimal dis-
advantage, and opposing them
as they are now, when the reg-
ulations would too greatly
damage their profits. Make no
mistake, with more than 2
million smokers either dying
or quitting each year, the man-
ufacturers have a tremendous
stake in not having their rush
season interfered with.
However, the regulations that»
Clinton wishes to impose are
entirely too controlling and
unfair, and on several counts
simply will not work.

First on the list is an item
requiring the major tobacco
companies to spend $150 mil-
lion on an anti-teen smoking
campaign. When was the last
time that you were required to
spend money on something
that was designed specifically
to combat directly with your
livelihood? The government
forcing an industry to fork

. over money for a campaign to

tell a certain constituency not
to use their product is danger-
ously close to the government
outlawing that industry entire-
ly.

Next is a federal mandate to
prohibit sales to those under
18. We have this law already
here in Pennsylvania. In case
none of you were aware, I’ll
let you in on a secret: it
doesn’t work. There are sim-
ply too many clerks and man-

agers who don’t care if
teenagers smoke for this to be

anything more than minimally.

effective.

Included also is a provision
banning the sale of clothing
containing advertising for
tobacco products. So essen-
tially, if you like smoking
Newports, you aren’t allowed
to tell anyone, so burn that cap
right now before the Feds see
it. Since the idea of censoring
the net to protect minors from
corruption fell through, many

apparently feel that they must

try another approach.

The list goes on: ‘no bill-
board advertising within 1,000
feet of a playground, no indi-
vidual cigarette or small-pack
(less than 20 cigarettes) sales
to anyone, and no stadium
advertising. The idea here,
essentially, is to remove any
possibility that any under-l8
individual might find out
about cigarettes or obtain
them, regardless of how many
groundless intrusions the gov-
ernment must make along the
way.

This is all an example of
one of the well-meaning but
seriously flawed theories of
government: that if an indus-
try gets “too powerful”, it
is the government’s job
to control it. The fact that
the power of the tobacco
industry allows itself to
extend to the under-l8 crowd
is something that leads many
to believe that the government
must step in. However,
an industry can only
become powerful. through
consumer choice. Therefore
it can only be justly con-
trolled the same way, regard-
less of how monumental

a task that might be. Any

intrusion into the supply-
demand curve means cutting
off what consumers want.
Regardless of who wants them
or why, there is no justifiable
reason for the government to
assume that intervention is
best for any individual. In this
case, consumers want to

smoke too much to see any-
thing happen to the tobacco
industry, as much as they
might complain about it. And
if you think individuals are
somehow helpless to actually
battle giant industries in this
modern era if" they actually
came together and chose to,
take a look at what has hap-
pened to major league base-
ball.

One thing I should say here

is that I am definitely not a 
Jesse Helms wannabe. If there i

is any industry whose nicotine
stained-neck I would like to
choke. it is this one. The
major manufacturers, if they
haven’t already. should be
coming out with statements
like the ones I used to read
when I worked in a Uni-Mart,
stating that they are opposed
to underage smoking. And if

you believe that,'I have a a

tobacco field to sell you. Ask
them, however, why they are
opposed to it, and you will get
a vague, “There are just some
things kids shouldn’t do” type
of answer. And therein lies the
point, one which they cannot
say: there is only one reason
that smoking is an unhealthy
practice for teenagers, and that
is that smoking is an
unhealthy practice for anyone.

But don’t expect either the‘

tobacco industry or hypocriti-
cal parent smokers to point
this out anytime soon.
Between my hatred for the
tobacco companies and the
fact that this is probably just

political posturing on_the part_ *

of Clinton, it would be easy to
just ignore this one. This,
however, is most likely a first
step towards the total ban of
cigarettes which, as much as I
prefer to eat in non-smoking
sections, would be as abhor-
rent and totally against the
purpose of government as
these current proposals are.
But when has that type of mis-
use ever stopped ours?

Schenley to its first Pittsburgh City ~-
League championship game in 44 years.
Asia senior, Dinkins threw for l,l27
yards and alsogained 422 more on the
ground. -

?‘I have always loved playing quarter-
back, especially at Schenley,” Dinkins
said. “I did not usually intend to run the
ball as much as I did, but when things
broke down I had to take off and run.”

Following his excellent senior season i
at quarterback, Dinkins was named The
Pittsbur I11 Post-Gazette City League
Player of the Year and was also voted
onto the Post"-Gazette Fabulous 22. \

On the opposite side of the ball.

, Dinkins excelled at middle linebacker.
recording a team-high 86 tackles. He
eventually played his way into the "pres-
tigious Big 33 All-Star Game that pits
the best from Pennsylvania against the 4

he played at linebacker rather than quar-
terback in the game. .

cism hurt me more than it helped. I mean

ly would have loved to play QB
instead,” Dinkins said.

There were numerous schools in the
hunt for this prize athlete, including‘
Clemson, Maryland and Virginia Tech,
but Pitt finally reeled in the star.

“From the start the Pitt coaches were
great to me, and the other schools just

‘ did not stack up to here,” Dinkins said.
“I ruled out Maryland early, the coaches 
were not great at Tech, and Clemson was
learning a new offense. If I went down
there, the linemen would be learning and
I cﬁild have gotten myself killed._”

For The Pitt News

The month of August is upon us again, and that means the
start of another yearof Pitt athletics. As most people know, the
football team is‘ looking forward to its up and coming season,
but so are coach_Steve Lewis and the track and field team.

This year’s track team has added a new face to the coaching
staff. Taking over this year's cross- country duties is Dave
Sobal. . - '

Sobal comes to the University of Pittsburgh from
Christopher Newport‘University, which is, according to Sobal,
“a Division III powerhouse.” He has been involved in track
and cross country for most of his life, running cross country in
high school and college. Sobal considers himself to.be a “stu-
dent of track and field.” ' ‘ ' ' '

For the next three months the cross country team will be ,

competing throughout the country. The season officially begins
September 9 at Oxford, Ohio, home of Miami of Ohio.

For Lewis, the cross country team has high expectations.

“We will definitely be a better program than we were last
year,” Lewis said. “We were "very young and hard working.
The whole team was young men and women.”

Lewis believes that the one thing the team ll: .' as an added
advantage is L‘‘.\‘_[.‘Ci‘lC!'tL‘.C. .

is confident about his future at Pitt.
“The biggest part o_f being a good quarter-
back is having mental toughness. John Ryan is

not the best QB in terms of pure talent, but he

is extremely tough mentally,” Dinkins said. “I
know I have the talent to be good, but when I
acquire the toughness upstairs I feel I can
eventually be the best quarterback in the
nation.”

Coach Curt Cignetti, recruiting coordinator,
said, “Darnell is quite ‘possibly the best all-
around athlete in this class, and that is saying
a lot considering the guys we have. He wants
to give it a shot at QB, so we are going to give
it to him, but time will tell.” -

A1though'Dinkins may have what it takes to
become the next great Pitt signal-caller, for
now he must focus on becoming the best Pitt
QB named Darnell.

Dinkins may be the biggest name in this
recruiting class’, but the Panthers have brought
in some excellent talent, including some des-
perately needed depth in the backfield.
Demetrius Harris, a 5-10, l80—pound tailback,
has opened many eyes with his great moves
and 4.4 speed. Karim Thompson, a 6-0, 190-
pound native of Roanoke, Va., will also see
time for the Panthers.

A Thompson is one of three late signees for
Pitt. LB Darius Wesber and RB Lorenzo
Woodley also were pleasant surprises.

“We had been following these guys all

along, and when they finally qualified acade-

mically we went after them,” Cignetti said.
“Luckily, we had some extra scholarships, and
we feel these guys will give us depth.”
Woodley has, however, left camp for per-
sonal reasons.
Wiry Leon Murray joins Dinkins as the

other quarterback "in the freshman class.‘

Murray, a 6-3, 185, two-sport star from
Shreveport, La., also hopes to play for Ralph
Willard and the men’s basketball team‘. At
C.E. Byrd High School, Murray not only
holds the record for all-time passing yards.
but he also was named a Street and Smith
Honorable Mention guard for hoops.

These quarterbacks and running backs have
to be protected. Enter Justin Wade (6-4, 295),
Raheem Johnson (6-3, 280) and Ethan Weidle
(6-5, 285). These three recruits are as big, if
not bigger, than the current members of the
offensive line and will likely anchor the line
down the road for the Panthers.

On the other side of the ball, Pitt looks to
have hit the jackpot. Cignetti and Co. reeled
in talent at nearly every position on defense.
The trench warriors include Ty Butler (6-3.
255), Chris Dilba (6-3. 258), and Trey
McCray (6-3, 240). Juco transfer Maurice
Harris is also a new and welcomed face on the
front line.

Phillip Clarke heads a incoming crop of
linebackers. Clarke, a 6-foot, 225—pound
Miami native, was ranked as one of the top 15

“Chris has been very impressive so far, and he has as good a

be in the hunt for the nation-
al title. A new coach, a quar-
terback controversy and
looming NCAA sanctions
will make this team only
seek redemption faster and
harder. It is virtually a top
five lock.

No. 3: Penn State. I am one
of the biggest Penn State
haters in the land, but you
cannot deny the greatness of
this team. Bobby Engram
will help a young quarter-
back, Wally Richardson, to ~
mature quickly. The defense
is young, but with a high-
powered offense to ease the
pressure and a home sched-
ule that sees Ohio State and
Michigan coming to town,
the Nittany Lions are book-
ing their trip to Pasadena
once again.

No. 2: Nebraska. Last
year’s national champs have
two starting quarterbacks in
Tommy Frazier and Brook

2 Berringer behind a strong

offensive line. The defense
should be solid once again
for the Cornhuskers.
However, Florida State will
be waiting in the Fiesta
Bowl.

No. 1: Florida State. This
team’s offense will explode
this season. Danny Kanell
has matured into one of the
nation’s top quarterbacks,
and with a running back tan-
dem of Warrick Dunn and
Rock Preston, this team will

, put up some amazing num-

bers. The defense is untested
but will be there when called
upon. This team will be the
national champion even
though it is everyone’s pre-
season number one.

So there it is, one person’s _

take on the college football
season. You may not agree
with any of it, butjust
remember that since the
NCAA has not instituted a
playoff system, sportswriters
like myself select the nation-
al champions.

Ed Ziegerzfuss is a staff
writerfor The Pitt News.

ers meeting
