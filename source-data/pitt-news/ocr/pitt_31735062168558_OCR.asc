UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Dr.HallidayAnnounces
Secret $ Allocations

For Classified Research

__ is‘
4‘.

DR. DAVID HALLIDAY
Dean of the Natural Sciences

by MARY LYNN BROWN

Eight per cent of the mon-
ey allocated to the Univers-
ity’s basic research effort is
being used for secret re-
search. This fact was reveal-
ed by Dean of the Natural
Sciences, David Halliday at
last weeks meeting of the

University Professors ‘

In his speech on “Secret Re-
search at the University,” Dr.
Halliday brought out ‘an issue fac-
ing professors around the coun-
try—should they have the priv-
ilege to do classiﬁed consultant
work for the government?

“A security clearance is re-
quired to this type of work,” re-
marked Dr. Halliday, “and it is
the individual’s perrogative to de-
cide to do secret research off
campus.” He emphasized that
while there is no administration
or faculty policy preventing sec-
ret research on this campus, spe-
ciﬁc departments do have con-
trol of what is done in the pri-
vate labs. , ‘

At this time, said Halliday, the
University has notdeveloped in-
dependent labs to do classiﬁed
research. However, out of the to-
tal 1,500 research projects in pro-
gress here, ten classiﬁed research
projects are being carried on by
seven principal investigators.

Halliday pointed out that he
had had no trouble ﬁnding out
what these projects were, des-
pite the fact that most are classi-
ﬁed “conﬁdential.” One of these
is located in Washington, the
others. are here at the University.
According to his ﬁndings, there
is no project which takes up the
full-time of any professor, and
there are not “hot issues” involv-
ing warheads or the CIA.

The University of Pennsylvania,
said Halliday, has been doing se-
cret research in biological war-

liam Matthews will discuss his

fare for some time. The Universi-
ty of California has been assem-
bling nuclear warheads, and the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology has ‘developed guidance
systems for ICBM rnissles. All of
these projects have been public-
ly discussed recently, and, al-
though the press has given con-
ﬂicting views, Halliday believes
that new secret research has been
banned at Penn.

Halliday contends that argu-
ments against secret research are
“protests against the war in Viet-
nam on the emotional level,” and

that the existence of particular-

programs has raised the issue.
But, he said, there is always the
question of whether these prod-
ucts would be needed in time of
peace. <

He explained that the problem
has been turned over to the Uni-
versity Senate for action and that
the Natural Science faculty has
voted in a questionnaire ‘as to
their preference in allowing se-
cret research at the University.

One professor at the meeting
volunteered to describe his ca-
reer in secret research since
1962. He said that had had some
knowledge of air-ﬂuorescence
(now being used to monitor the
atomic test ban) since‘ World
War.

Questions Arise Despite    
Rush’s OK on Constitution 

(See Editorial “Counseling, Confi-
rlentially and Reviewi”—page 4.)

Although ‘formal approval
of the new Student Govern-

ment (SG) constitution has-

now been given, there are
questions about-the proposed
Review Board which may

have to be cleared up ﬁrst. These
questions arose in a WPGH in-

terview with Dr. David Kurtz-
man, acting chancellor of the Uni-
versity, last week. '
Formal approval of the consti-
tution had to be granted by Dean
of Student ‘Affairs Helen Rush
before the document could be-
come effective. Dean Rush ac-
cepted the favorable decision of
the Recognitions Committee,
which reviews major changes in
the constitution and by-laws of

Bishop Dodge Predicts
Violent African Revolt

by NAN ISEN

“The minority ruling the
majority, the people against
colonial rule, the haves vs.
the have nots,” sums up the
basic problem in Rhodesia
today, according to Bishop
Dodge, a Methodist Minister
who Worked in Salsbury,
Rhodesia. Dodge was asked
to leave by the government
due to his political views.

In the past ten years, 35 new
nations have been created in Af-
rica. The majority of the 26 mil-
lion Africans are ruled by the
four million white caucasian mi-
nority. Each nation" is only con-
cerned with its own affairs, and
the Bishop compares these na-
tions to -post- colonial United
States, where “local loyalties su-

_perceeded national loyalities.”

In Rhodesia, there is an organ-
ized African movement against
the government of Prime Minis-
ter Ian Smith, however, the -mo
political parties which comprise
this movement must operate in
exile, because laws prohibit meet-
ings of more than three people
at a time without government
consent. Helicopters keep a con-
stant watch on the people and
break up such groups. The gov-
ernment may also put a person
in a detention camp for up to
ﬁve years without trial.

Bishop Dodge believes that if
the Rhodesian Africans‘ stage a.
violent outbreak it will take
place within the next year, but

only if present conditions worsen
and the people become desperate.
Dodge also believes that such an
outbreak will have the support of
the Communists. Students who-
have completed the -equivalent of
eighth grade, and who cannot
ﬁnd jobs in the cities will be the
main protestors.

TBISHOP DODGE
Methodist Minister from Rhodesia»

Before further action can be
taken on the part of the Africans,
Bishop Dodge stated that the A1‘.-
rican nations must unite eco-
nomically. The nations are sep-
arately too weak to stage an ef-
fective protest. The economic

union will take one or two gen-

erations to form, but, Africans
will be a stronger, more prosper-
ous continent for it.

student organizations, and of the .
approximately 1,800 students who
voted in the referendum. The
constitution will take effect with-‘ D
the SG election in J anuary.‘

However, as Dr. Kurtzman
stated, “The question is how far. 4
the Appeals (Review) Board can
go and what kinds of problems:
they should be involved in?” ‘ ‘

Kurtzman feels that, in indi- “
vidual disciplinary cases, stu-
dents should not have to discuss" 
personal problems before nine 7 '
people (the Board’s membership) 
but should be able to discuss _'
such problems with the Dean of;
Student Affairs in a more conﬁ-
dential manner. A “logical” area
for the Board, says Kurtzman, i
would be cases involving groups, S
such as fraternities.

_ Jon Meyers, SG senator and a
member of the Recognitions Com-
mittee, feels that the Review ,
Board ‘‘will only have the pow- 
er’ that the Dean of Student Af-A :1"
fairs wants to give it. A The ‘Re-= --
view Board will not be an ulti-__
mate authority,” continued Mey-‘
ers. “The student has the right ‘A
of ultimate appeal to the chan-. ,1, «
cellor.” ‘ . ‘. 

The constitution itself states:.h;.l..~;~"
that the Board is to decide on_ 
the constitutionality of SG ac-  ‘
tions when a question is raised.’
It must also consider disciplinary.
cases only when asked by the
Dean of Student Affairs or the
dean of the school in which a
student is enrolled. There is no"
explicit provision allowing appeal, .
of disciplinary cases by students. ‘

UMDC Weekend
Funds Refused .

The Allocations Committee
again refused to grant Men's Dor- ’
rnitory Council (MDC) $3,200 re-
quested for a “Dorm Weekend?"
In a special meeting Thursday,
Student Government (SG) ap- ‘-
proved this decision of the Com-

Originally, the committee had-
also refused to grant the funds,
but SG had asked for a reconsi-
deration of the request.

SNCC Dialogue

Civil Rights Movement Discussed  

by PAUL STOLLER ‘

Is the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee
(SNCC) harmful or ‘helpful
to the Civil Rights move-
ment? This was the topic of
discussion between Dr. Mor-
ris Berkowitz, associate professor
of sociology, and Rabbi Richard
Rubinstein, chaplain to Jewish
students, Friday night at the
Crumbling Wall Coffee House.
‘Speaking ﬁrst, Dr. Berkowitz
stated that he had contributed
money to SNCC in the past and
would continue to do so in the
future ’  paddedhthat  ‘is

things done. According to Dr.
Berkowitz, “SNCC has not had a
history of violence and any con-
nection between SNCC and vio-
lence is a violence to SNCC.” Dr.
Berkowitz could not understand
how other Negro groups could
sit around and wait for their
rights.

Rabbi Rubinstein countered
Berkowit*z’s position by stating
that violence is not the method
to gain rights. “Being a Jew, I
have learned,” he stated, “that
the power equation is weighted
against minority groups, and that
they do not gain their rights

"through violence. "Negroes must_

stein supported his thesis that
violence has had a bad effect by
citing the primary victory of
Georgia's Lester Maddox, a seg-
regationist. The Rabbi went on
to predict that the effects of Ne-
gro violence will aid Ronald Re-
gan in his attempt to win the
governorship of California.
Professor Berkowitz retorted by
stating that the election of Mad-
dox and Reagen would have a.
good effect because when in of-
ﬂee they would show their re-
spective constituencies what bad
effects their policies would cause.
Rejecting Dr. Berkowitz’s opin-
ion, Rabbi Rubinstein stated that

After a number of questions’
were raised from the ﬂoor, the
discussion turned to riots. Berk- I

like riots, but riots can have pos-
itive effects by stating that riots.
would drive the slum lords away.’

Rubenstein Discusses

Radical Theology Roots

by ROBERT ZAVOS

“Radical theology is not some-
thing which was discovered by
Time Magazine last Easter Sun-
day,” began Dr. Richard L. Ru-
benstein at the second lecturein
his series on “Radical Theology
and the Death of God.”

“The ultimate roots begin in
the Bible where it says: “man
shall not see me and live.” “This
implies that there is a great dis-
tance between man and God and
there is no way any human can
grasp God's existence,” remark-
ed Dr. Rubenstein.

He continued, “We can never
tell what God is——we can only
tell what he is not. God’ em-
braces everything and to know
what a thing is you must know
what it is not. Thus, God can-
not be a thing. God is, therefore,
nothing.” To be speciﬁc, Dr. Ru-
bens-tein’s God is the “Holy Noth-
ing.”

Another root of radical theo-
logy begins with Hegel’s dialec-
tic of the Master and the Slave.
In all encounters between two
people each tries to dominate the
other. The one who surrenders

A ﬁrst is the one who fears destruc-

tion and cares more about life;
he becomes the slave. While it
may appear that the‘ slave is
worse off, it is really the oppo-
site.

The master becomes dependent
on the slave, while the slave is

dependent on himself: The slave
can identify with what he pro-
duces, but the master cannot,
since he. has not produc_ed any-
thing. Hegel’s dialectic goes on"
to say‘that the slave will make
a good bourgeois and eventually
will take over from the master.
This theme continually pervades
the writings of Karl Marx.
The connection between rad-
ical theology and the master and

the slave _becomes .clear if we"

consider God to be the" master
and man to be the slave. In order
to be fully autonomous man must
overthrow the “gods” which so
totally dominate man’s life. Ac-
cording to Karl Marx, men are
chained to .a -ﬁgment of their
imagination and must break the
chains to live a fulﬁlling life.

Dr. Rubenstein cited the fol-
lowing example of man’s enslave
ment to God. On a eostal island
011.’ Spain, the inhabitants have a
week of religious ceremonies
every year during which they
bring out all of their beautiful re
ligious symbols which are worth
a fortune. At that time a visitor
may walk through the town and
see the great poverty of the peo-
Dle. People starve as the millions
of dollars worth of religious or-
naments are paraded through the
streets.

(Dr. Rubenstein continues the
series tomorrow at 4:30 p.m. in
Room 45 of Skibo Hall, Carnegie
Institute of Technology campus.)

Here are 7 knotty problems

facing the Air Force:

canyou help us solve one?

‘I. Repairs in space. if something goes
wrong with a vehicle in orbit, how can it
be fixed’? Answers must be found, if large-

scale space operations are to become a.

reality. For this and other assignments Air
Force scientists and engineers will be
called on to answer in the next few years,
we need the-— best brains available. '

2." lunar landing. The as
exact composition of
the lunar surface, as
well as structural

and propulsion char-
acteristics of the space
vehicle, enter into '
this problem. Important study remains to
be done—‘and, as an Air Force officer,
you could be the one to do it!

  

3. life-support biology. The filling of:

metabolic needs over very extended peri-

ods of time in space is..one of the most —

fascinating subjects that
Air Force scientists are in-
vestigating. The results
promise to have vital ram-
ifications for our—|ife on
earth, as well as in outer
space.

 

 

7. Pilot performance.

 
 

 

4. Space orientation. The orbital prob-
lems of a spacecraft, including its ability
to maneuver over selected points on the
earth, are of vital importance to the mili-
tary utilization of space. There are plenty
of assignments for young Air Force physi-
cisls in this area.

5. Synergetic plane changing. The abil-

also be crucial to space operations.Where
but in the Air Force could Sc.B.'s get the
chance to work on such fascinating proj-
ects right at the start of their careers?

and greater distances, pro-
pulsion—more—than any-
thing else—will become the
limiting factor. New fuels
and new propulsion tech-
niques must be found, if we
are to keep on exploring
the mysteries of space. And
it may well be an Air Force
scientist on his first assign-
ment’ who makes ‘the big
breakthrough!

6. Space propulsion. As our
space flights cover greater

   
   
  

Important tests must still be
made to determine how the
pilots of manned aero-
spacecraft will react to
long periods away from

the earth. Of course I
not every new Air
Force officer be-

I comes involved in research and develop-

ment right away. But where the most ex-
_ - citing advances are

'  taking place, young
Air Force scientists,
administrators,
pilots, and engineers
are on the scene.

    

A good way to start is through Air
Force ROTC. Superior students may qual-
ily for Air Force scholarships. Many col-
leges and universities also have a special
2-year Air Force ROTC program. For de-
tails, contact your nearest Air Force rep-
resentative, or mail the coupon today.

Counseling, Co

A proposal on paper can often sound like a grand boon to humanity.
But once it’s put into practice it seems like {nore trouble than its worth.
Such is slowly becoming the case with the recently approved University
.Review Board (part of the new Student Government Constitution.)

‘ As the Wheels of the Board are about to go in motion, several ques-
tions arise. Will the Review Board be able to hear cases brought before it
by students as well as administrators? The new Constitution states that
only the Dean of Student Affairs and academic deans can bring cases be-

‘fore the Board. It makes no mention of a student being able to initiate
review of a discipline case. At the same time thelConstitution states that
the Review Board will be able to decide on its own procedures.‘ It would-
seem ridiculous to maintain a Board which is only empowered to review
cases initiated by a Dean. It would most likely be a hot day in January

xg.

when a.Dean would submit his own decision for review.

If students would be allowed to initiate ‘review another problem
comes up. A student might present his views on the supposed infraction

- of the discipline. But in defending the University’s decision, a dean might
‘have to present confidential information to the committee which the stu-
dent had not wished released. This student shouldbe aware that in the
process of review his name would dragged through the semi-public mud of

the committee.

BLARING THROUGH the

Mahoney’s campaign slogan

“" representative sample of the

key issue in the 1966 elec-

Unfortunately, Mahoney’s
gubernatorial campaign tech-

theme that is forming a dis-
tinctive and disturbing pat-
tern throughout our nation.
In Chicago’s 11th Congres-

GOP Alderman John J} Hoel-
len, campaigning against in-
cumbent Rep. Roman Pucin-
ski, -declared, “I don’t believe
God meant for robins to mix

The approach of the back-
lash candidate ranges from
Hoellen’s veiled utterance to

 ’ . Arkansas Democratic guber-

natorial nominee James D.
Johnson’s blatant remark
that “separation of races is
better for both races.” Since
the primary, Johnson has
“softened his stand,” though,

West. GOP gubernatorial
candidate Reagan recently
appeared before California's
Real Estate Association to
deliver an attack on open oc-
cupancy laws.

And in the North Illinois’
senatorial race claimed a
new candidate, Mayor Rob-
ert Sabonjian of Waukegan,
who plunged into the Paul
Douglas-‘Charles Percy con-
test as a write-in, with a
blunt appeal for "backlash
votes. Immediately, Sabon-
jian “-found a ready-made
block. of votes in the ethnic
neighborhoods where Martin
Luther King marched last
summer,” reported the Oct.
17 issue of Newsweek.

Do these candidates rep-
resent a majority of ‘our

voters? According to sur-

veys by pollster Louis Har-
ris, 85 per cent of all whites

are opposed to any sort of

Civil Rights demonstration,
which is an increase of 16

points since the Birmingham

incident of the summer of
1963.

MAHONEY AND ‘Reagan

were evidently representing
51 percent of all whites
and 69 pe-r cent in the low
income brackets, who oppos-
ed fair housing laws. Har-
ris included that racial ten-
sions are now at “a higher
point than at any time since
the Negro revolution be-
gan.”

Regretfullyf the Negro’s
drive for equality is far from
a fait accompli. Our nation
has obviously made strides
towards granting the Negro
his due, but the process is
far from complete. As Presi-
dent Lyndon B. Johnson

preaches equality, Mary-_
rland’s Mahoney’s sound

trucks keep booming refrains
of “Your home is your cas-
tle.” And the American peo-
ple are placed in the uncom-
fortable predicament of wait-
ing to see which voice will
ultimately prevail.

GraduateStudent

Questions Fee

I am grateful to learn that the
undergraduate Student Govern-
ment (SG) is vitally concerned
with the“‘role of graduate stu-
dents in campus activities” and
that SG has deemed it in the best
interest of the graduate student
body to assess it for an “activ-
ities” fee of $5 per student.

I would ask in return, how-
ever, that SG publicly answer the
following questions;

1. Why were graduate students
not informed of the proposed as-
sessment prior to the passage of
the measure so that they might
be represented for purposes of
discussion and voting.

2. Why were graduate students
not permitted to vote on such a
measure by means of a public
referendum?

3. “A graduate student inter-
ested in skiing or folk dancing

can join groups organized around

these activities.” This was one of
the justiﬁcations oﬁered for the
assessment, i.e.,. it seemed unfair
to permit graduate students to
participate in these activities
without paying an activities fee.
This might be true'if these groups
were presently subsidized by the
student activities fund; such is
not the case. Why didn’t the SG
Allocations Committee allocate
any funds for these groups?

4. Can SG point to any student.
organization whatsoever which is
both presently subsidized by ac-
tvities fees and is the focal point

p of widespread graduate student

participation?

5. A graduate student can at-
tend “the Student Union Board
Lecture Series” or attend the
“free SUB movies.” It is also
true that any member of the Uni-
versity community can do like-
wise — whether faculty member,
administrator, part-time student,
guest or friend of the University.
Why is it suddenly so important
to “charge” graduate students for
this privilege.

6. The William Pitt Debate
Union was recently allocated $3,-
700 from the student activities
fund. A substantial part of this
money will be used to send four
debaters to Europe. The remain-
der of the allocation subsidizes
transportation for one or two

Letters‘ to the Editor

When all is pared down the only really logical area for review would
be actions taken by the Student Government. At present there is no group
to judge the constitutionality of proposals passed by the Senate.

It must be remembered that the recognition granted the Constitution
is only temporary and at the end of a year the worth of the document will ,
be reappraised. The Recognition Committee at that time will have to decide
whether first of all the Committee has not been overtaxed, having to hear
cases more often than expected. A situation could easily arise where it
takes several weeks or months before a case could be heard. The efficiency
of the University discipline case could be fowled up in the process.

Moreover, the Recognition Committee will have to judge whether
the presentation of confidential information concerning one student to nine
people is in the end deleterious to the reputation of the student and the

IIIIIIIIIHIIIIIIIE

other debaters. How does this e:x-
penditure “beneﬁt” gaduate stu-

dents, or any students other than pg

those involved?

7. The Heinz Chapel Choir re-
ceived an allocation of $3,000.
Once again, this is a subsidy for
transporttaion. Is this a “beneﬁt”
to graduate students?

8. SG received a bounty of
$450. Why and what for? Gavels?

9. Nine thousand dollars was
allocated for “Homecoming Week-
end" in order to subsidize enter-
taimnent for the fortunate 900
ticket holders and .their dates.
Where is the “beneﬁt” to the
other 3,700 students who paid an
activities fee but are foreclosed

~ from attendance? Graduate stu-

dents, who are allegedly getting
a “free-ride” for campus activ-
ities, are not so fortunate this
time: they will be charged $5 in-
stead of $3.50.

10. Another $6,000. will be al-
located for “Winter Weekend.”
Once again, a minority of stu-
dents will be subsidized at the
expense of the majority. Why?

11. The senior yearbook re-
ceived $1,025. Since when do grad-
uate students appear in this pub-
lication?

12. It is dismaying to note that
the Hill Education Project was
allocated $375 .after requesting
$2,200. Here was an opportunity
for the Allocations Committee to
make a sound and productive in-
vestment and to create immeas-
urable good will for the Univer-
sity. Is HEP less important than
“big-name” entertainment for a
one-night stand?

13. The Men’s Dorm Council,
directly represents over 1,600 fee-
paying students, requested $3,000-
for a “Dorm Weekend.” They re-
ceived $0. What is the reason for
this action? Would too many stu-
dents be “benefited” if the mon-
ey was allocated?

14. “We look very selﬁshly to
see what will beneﬁt the stu-
dents who pay the activities fee.”

. Where is the evidence to support

this statement by the Allocations
Committee?

15. Who are the members of
the Allocations Committee? What
are their qualiﬁcations for man-
aging a fund of $32,500, other
than the somewhat perverted
sense of humor which they have
displayed thus far?

Acting Chancellor Kurtzman pointed out that the logical area for
the Committee would be group discipline cases. But most group discipline
cases in recent years have concerned fraternities which have been decided
by the highly efficient Interfraternity Council (IFC) Judicial Board. The
relation between the IFC judicial board and the Review Board ‘presents a

Michael Harrington's THE OTHER AMERICA has been credited with playing an important
role in starting the War on Poverty. As Eliot Fremont-Smith wrote in The New York
Times, ‘‘It therefore has the distinction of being one of those rare books that directly
influence political action."

')‘ In his new book. THE ACCIDENTAL CENTURY, Michael Harrington examines the cultural.
and intellectual crisis confronting the United States and the rest of the Western world
in the 20th century. This crisis has been brought about by the “accidental revolution,"
in which an unplanned social and creative technology has haphazardly reshaped our
lives and put in doubt all our ideologies and beliefs. The resulting decadence threatens
to destroy Western civilization and with it the Western concept of man.

 

This exciting and provocative book by one of the most brilliantrsocial critics of our time

 A Offenses Lack Punch

But Defenses Kicking

As Booters Tie Kent 1- 1

by MIKE BROURMAN
KENT, OHIO — Sandwiched between two scoring
thrusts, the booters and Kent State played 80 _minutes of
scoreless soccer. But, if anyone believes scoring is the key
to an exciting game, he should have seen those eighty min-

utes.
For, between two offsetting
goals was played some of the

 hardest soccer of the season. Both

teams left the ﬁeld with their
fair share of bumps and bruises;
the referrees passed out warn-
ings like politicians pass out elec-

_ tion promises.

The booters scored in the open-
ing three minutes. Bob Racunas

, . ﬁred a hard shot that the Kent

State goalie deﬂected, but could-
n’t hold. In the ensuing scram-
ble, Ernie Mouen scored. The
lead held until, in a similar
scramble, Kent’s Tom Goehring

A ' evened the score with three min-

utes left.

In between these two goals
came the real ﬁreworks, most of
them lit by the soccer team._ As

.usual, they had no trouble get-

ting shots. But they couldn’t con-

‘ vert them into. goals. Sal Tavares

and Gary Foertsch kept coming
close, but not close enough.
Kent gots its offense going in
the ﬁnal half, and this served to
increase the punishment dealt
out by both sides. Foertsch was
warned for running into the
Kent goalie. Later Vince Barto-
lotta was ejected for a similar
move. He left with a lump the
size of a baseball on one leg, the
result of a previous encounter

6 with a Kent payer. Bill Zurzola

’ was forced to leave with a knee

_ injury.

 

On the other side of the ledger,
two Kent players and the goalie
were forced out with injuries due
to the booters’ hard hitting.

Two overtime periods result-
ed in no winning score, but in

' » countless more aches and bruises.

 

 It’s no wonder that when Kent

WEST POINT, ‘N.Y., October 22-—Army, remembering ‘D

General Custer'smassacre nearly 100 years ago, must have
had venom in their hearts when they met and embarrassed
the Panthers, 28-0, at Michie Stadium, Saturday.

Dave Hart, surprised by Army
coach Tom Cahill’s corps as was
Custer by the Indians, actually
couldn’t say what the season's
ﬁfth defeat means.

“I am at a loss for any an-
swer,” Hart said. It's midseason
for college football, but it’s ques-
tionable whether Panthers will
reach their form. And on whom
does the blame fall? I

“I don’t blame the kids,” Hart
said. “They’re tired, beaten kids.
It’sjmidseason and they are lag-
ging already. They’re so tired
they can’t respond. In a game,
there’s no one to spell them.

“It’s just tough,” Hart contin-
ued, “and that’s the way it is.”

Leading the Cahill assault o-n
the Panthers, cadet quarterback
Steve Lindell looked like the
Swamp Fox to would ‘be tacklers.
Five times Lindell was trapped
for a loss and each time he evad-

ted Panthers and -gained ten or-
more yards for a ﬁrst down. His .

net yardage was 49*.
For the game, he completed
nine of 16 passes for 156 yards

and two touchdowns. Lindell’s‘

ﬁrst arial score traveled seven
yards to tight end Gary Steele,

who caught it between three de- I

fenders in the end zone.

Lindell’s second big toss landed . if

in end Terry Young's hands on

the Panther 29-yard line. Young 

ran the rest of the way for a 66-
yard scoring play. Except for
sub-quarterack Jim O’Too1e’s 11-

yard touchdown run in the ﬁnal 

quarter and an Army safety on
a blocked punt, Lindell had a‘

hand on every score. He kicked 43  

29 and 34-yard ﬁelds goals and
two placements. O =

On the Panther side of the
ledger, the offense totaled only‘
150 yards. “Army had a real
strong defense, but it’s the same
old story,” Hart said, “the of_-
fense didn’t move the ball.

Before the half ended with
—Ai-my leading 3.0, quarterback Ed
James injured his throwing arm.
With the Panthers one big offen-
sive weapon eliminated, the sec-
ond-half was like Hart’s last

‘ stand.

“I hate to think of the next
two weeks,” Hart said as he
thought of the upcoming games

F rosh’s   Weak Practice
A p parentatN otreD%ame

by ROY JACOBS

It’s hard to get angry, or even upset, with the freshman-

footba11er’s 29-0 loss to Notre Dame, Saturday. There really

isn’t anyone to blame.

After all, it’s a little tough to
come up against a defensive line
that averages over 250 pounds
and has been working together
two hours a day for weeks when
you’ve only practiced a combined
total of 45-50 minutes together
in the week preceding the game.
It’s also a little tough to play
good defense at a position you’ve
had to learn by reading your as-
signments on paper without prac-
ticing there.

But it’s a fact that the varsity '

has no depth, and the Cubs have
to be used to help out. As one
freshman put it, “We have to suf-
fer for Michelosen’s mistakes.”
Of course, it doesn’t help ei-
ther when Notre Dame outrushes
you, 184 yards to nine. In two
games now the Cubs have gained
a total of 32 yards on the ground.
The frosh had their good mo-

to you?

 

Let's accept the idea that you
need life insurance . . . now. And
you'll need it more as the years
go by.

One of the smartest things you
can do now is to talk to your
College Life representative. Let
him tell you about the BENE-
FACTOR; the life insurance pol-
icy that is individually tailored to
your specific needs.

You are a preferred risk—that
means your life insurance will
cost you less. You can benefit
from deferred deposits.

THE LIFE AND THOUGHT OF FRANZ ROSENZWEIG

Writing in the August issue of Commentary, Milton Himmelfarb asserted that Franz Rosenzweig, a -

little known German-Jewish layman had had a greater impact upon the thought of contemporary
Jewish thinkers in America than in any other thinker, including Martin Buber. Rosenzweig’s most creative
period was during the nineteen-twenties. He was a religious existentialist and a student of Hegel. In
some ways, his career calls to mind the carer of a German Christian who has enormously influenced
American Christianity, Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Dr. Rubenstein’_s course will be in effect an introduction to
Jewish religious existentialism. Thursdays at 3:00 p.m. beginning October 20th.
