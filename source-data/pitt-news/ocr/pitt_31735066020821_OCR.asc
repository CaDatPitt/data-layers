Protesters

march for
rights to

abortion

By Brendan Kevenides
Senior Staff Writer ‘

The Pitt Coalition for Abor-
tion Rights, along with 25
other Pittsburgh area organiza-
tions, will march on Sunday to
protest the actions of anti-
abortion groups and the deci-
sion by the Supreme Court to
reconsider the legality of
abortion.

According to Jeanne Clark,
national chairwoman for
reproductive rights for the Na-

tional Organization for Wom-
en, the Supreme Court made
abortion legal in 1973 dueto
public pressure.

Today, the pressure is com-
ing from the other side and
that must change, said Clark.

”We’re no longer calm and
quiet. We're getting rowdy
here,” said Katherine Robin-
son of the Pitt Law Womens’
Association and Pitt coordina-

° "tor for the Pennsylvania chap-

ter of NOW. .

Clark said the reason that
anti-abortion groups seem
more vocal on the issue could
be because pro-choice groups
simply took it for granted that
they had the right to legal
abortions.

”There is no precedent of
this. We didn't expect our
rights to be takenaway,” she
said.

The Pitt Coalition, which is
workingwith NOW, is made
up of five established student

organizations that have agreed _

to co-sponsor the march. The
Pitt Law Women's Associa-
tion, The Campus Women's
Organization, The New Stu-
dent Network, The Student
Action Union and The Pitt
Democrats have committed
their groups’ participation in
marching and recruiting stu-
dents to join the coalition.

”We have four days and we
need thousands of people at
the march,” said Robinson at
a Tuesday night coalition
meeting.

“Our r'r1arch_wil| start at the

Federal Building, to symbolize '

Pittsburghers’ concern about
the Supreme Court justices’
decision to reconsider the law
making abortion legal, (Roe

vs. Wade, 1973),” said Phyl- '

lis Wetherby, president of The
First ‘Pittsburgh National Or-

Students trained for archaeological dive

By Katherine Furlong
For The Pitt News

Pitt's first underwater archaeo-
logical diving class will be held
this weekend at Trees Hall.

The class includes the construc-
tion of a grid for mapping an un-
derwater archaeological site that
will be simulated on the bottom
of the pool.

The course will be taught by
certified underwater

department and Dick Bradshaw,

the aquatics director at Trees

instructor.
‘Jim Dwyer of Pitt's archaeology

Hall.

The training is being offered
through a federal grant that
Dwyer received to make an un-
derwater archaeological survey of
Lake Erie. Dwyer has had ex-
perience diving at sites off the
coast of Israel.

”There is a bad rapport be-
tween the professional archaeol-
ogist and the sport diver,” Dwyer
said. ”We want to utilize the

sport diver to find archaeological .

sites and train them in the proper
techniques.”
Dwyer said that this is the first

program of its kind.

The class is open to anyone
who already has an'open—water
scuba-diving license.

This weekend's class is limited
to eight people and is already full.
However, Dwyer is planning
another program for the . first
weekend in May. He hopes to
offer a regular course in under-
water archaeology through the ar-
chaeology department next
semester. ‘

Bradshaw said that he is excit-
ed about the program. ”It looks
like there is quite an interest from

the student body. Courses are fill-
ing up faster than we can offer
them,” he said.

’’In scuba diving, you can crash
to the bottom and destroy the
site. We teach skills like hovering
and moving in a gravity-neutral
atmosphere. You have to be very

‘careful. It's not the same as land

archaeology,” Bradshaw said.

After exploring the controlled
artificial site at Trees, Dwyer
hopes to take the class to dive at
authentic sites in Pennsylvania or
Florida in the spring.

City residents participate in AIDS survey

By Suzanne Sabol
Staff Writer

Allegheny County residents
will be opening their doors and
rolling up their sleeves for Pub-
lic Health Service researchers
conducting a pilot AIDS study
this month.

From the 480,000 households
in Allegheny County, 350 were
randomly chosen for the survey.

Since only permanent housing

was counted, no Pitt dormitory
students will be included in the
survey, said County Health
spokesman Guillermo Cole.
The subjects chosen for the
study received letters in the mail

from Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop, explaining the test and ask-
ing for cooperation. Throughout
January and Februaiy, their
homes will be visited by a two-
person research team.

A technician will draw a blood
sample, then an interviewer will
conduct a survey concerning
high-risk AIDS factors, such as
intravenous-drug use and sexual
behavior. The survey is complete-
ly anonymous and voluntary,
Cole said. After completion of the
survey, a $50 cash payment will
be given to participants for their
time and effort. -

”So far, the study is going very
well. The public response is ex-

cellent,” Cole commented} .
He added that the goal of the
study is actually to test public ac-
ceptance of an AIDS test. They
want to ”see if people are will-
ing to cooperate.” I
The results of the Allegheny

County study will determine the‘

feasibility of a national AIDS
study. Cole said there will also be
a larger AIDS pilot study in
another city, with a sample of
1,200-1,500 people.

Allegheny County was chosen
as the first test site for two rea-
sons, Cole explained. First, the
Pittsburgh area has an economic,
racial and ethnic mix that is a
good sample for the national

study.

Second, ,”Allegheny County
has a strong, active local health
department that has good rela-
tions with the community organi-
zations supporting the AIDS
testing program,” Cole said.

The survey should be complet-
ed by the end of February, and a
report on the subject will be is-
sued by early April. This report
won’,t reveal the number of Al-
legheny County residents with
the AIDS virus, but it will com-
ment on the effectiveness of the
methods used in the pilot study.

The report will include recom-

mendations on how to improve

Blue Cross said the number of
new AIDS patients among its
regional subscribers may reach
331 in 1989, an increase of 130
new cases over last year.

subscribers in the five-county
southeastern Pennsylvania
region.

The report includes the first
analysis of medical costs incurred
by patient-subscribers with AIDS
over the patient’s lifetime.

From 1984 to 1985, the num-
ber of AIDS patient-subscribers
increased by about 69 percent,
followed by an increase of 51
percent from 1986 to 1987.
Guided by those figures, Blue
Cross analysts said the estimated
number of new AIDS patients in
1988 would range from 175 to

 

196, and from 264 to 331 in
1989.

_ The report shows hospital
charges for AIDS patients be-
tween 1984-87 amounted to
$13.3 million, involving 865 in-
patient hospitalizations totaling
10,781 days.

Briggs [said that in 1989, In-
dependence Blue Cross ”will in-
cur anywhere from $17.7 million
to $22.2 million in AIDS treat-
ment costs for new AIDS patients.
The figures are still coming in for
last year. But it appears that we
will have spent between $11.7
million and $13.2 million for the
treatment of new AIDS patients in
1988.”

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January I 9, 1989

Problems and I ines

By Megan Reese
For The Pitt News

As the winter term Add/Drop
period drew to a close on Jan. 18,
many students found themselves
without the courses they needed
due to closed classes.

For Pitt Stud.€fJ_IS,,:t)lIe problem

, _s of getting into the classes neces-
0‘sary for graduation is a familiar

one. According to the registrar's
office, Pitt offers approximately
6,900 classes, the majority of
which are closed.

One department that always
finds its classes closing quickly is
the English department. Accord-
ing to Fiore Pugliano, an adviser
in the English department, this is
not unusual.

Part of the reason can be at-
tributed to the general education
requirements specifying that stu-
dents must take composition and
literature courses, causing them
to fill up almost immediately.

The School of Education has
begun a new curriculum which
involves phasing out its under-
graduate five—year program. This

_\ rogram causes Add/Drop con-
gestion by promoting closed

classes.

According to Pugliano, these
changes encouraged the recent
rise in the number of English
majors at Pitt.

The history department also
finds closed classes a problem.
General education requirements
also include public policy and

. -Q)reign culture, both of which are

offered by. . the
department. ‘ ’

According to an adviser in that
department, ”History has such a
broad range of topics which ex-
tend beyond history that it can be
used to satisfy general education
requirements, such as public poli-
cy and foreign culture.”

When students elect to take the

history

wgourses offered by the history

department to satisfy require-
ments,—classes close more rapid-
ly and fewer special permissions
are granted.

The number of special permis-
sion slips given out to students is
also an issue in the English
department.

“formed by Add/olrop

According to Pugliano, ”The ‘

number of special permissions
given out depends upon the in-
structor. Usually two to four spe-
cial permission slips will be given
out, although no teacher has
been told that [he] must take a
student into a class.”

Some instructors are unable to

grant students special permission '0

to enter a class because the regis-
trar will say the course is closed.

Dr. Susan Harris Smith, a
professor who teaches contem-
porary drama, is in this position.

”Right now, I have 18 or 19
students in a class that can take
22. I've been turning away stu-
dents who need this course be-
cause the registrar says it's
closed.” _ '

She also added that on the first
day of the course, she asked the
class to alert her if anyone would
be dropping the course. She said

that only one person had the

courtesy to let her know.

”If a student is going to drop a
course, then the instructor should
be told, otherwise students who

_ really want to take the class are

being cheated out of their oppor-
tunity to take the course.”

She also feels that the registrar
ought to send the instructors a
preliminary class roster so they
can gauge how many students
should or should not be permit-
ted into a class.

”It works both ways. This
semester I'm turning students
away from the class, and I have
room for them. On the other
hand, last semester I admitted
four or five students that there
really wasn't room for because I
was unsure about my class size,”
she noted.

Smith said, ”All I want to know
is: Who exactly is registered for
the class?”

One issue surrounding the
problem of closed classes is the

,. usual: ”The demand for a class

goes beyond the limit available,”
Pugliano said.

Smith feels that a class roster of
students circulated to teachers
early in the term would create
”fewer disappointed students if

many students they're initially
dealing with.”

The different departments
would be able to better meet the
academic needs of the students,
thus eliminating the problem of
questionable availability or over-
crowding, she said.

Pugliano also noted thatithe En-
glish department tries to open up
as many 30- and 50-level courses
as it can, since these courses
count as level-on'e requirements
for literature and tend to fill up
quickly. '

As graduation nears, some stu-

dents overlook required courses
necessary for graduation. As the
student attempts to get into the
class needed, many times the end
result will be disappointment due
to closed classes and an inability
to gain special permission.
”One issue is why it takes so

Researchers examine,

smoking and bulimia

Pitt researchers are examining
the effects of nicotine on women
with bulimia. This study is the
first in a series being conducted
by researchers at the Center for
Overcoming Problem Eating at
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic.

Dr. Cindy Bulik, who is head-
ing the study, said that there
seems to be a pattern of poly—drug
use in bulimics. In a previous
study, Bulik found that 48 per-
cent of bulimics abused alcohol
and that 23 percent were alco-
holics. .

Studies of the effects of alcohol
and other recreational drugs led
Bulik to believe that more com-
mon drugs such as nicotine and

. caffeine could also have an effect

on the bulimic population.
Women who participate in the

study will meet with researchers
on four consecutive mornings.
Results of the study are gathered

entirely from the participants’
self—reporting of their moods. '

Participants spend each of the
four mornings in a research

room, similar to a hotel room. Ev-

ery 30 minutes, participants areO~
asked to report through a com—'
puter terminal how they are
feeling.

in order to study the effects of
nicotine, participants will be per— ’
mitted to smoke on alternate days
during the four—day period.

Bulik said that through this
study, researchers hope not only
to gain an understanding of how
nicotine effects the moods of
women who are bulimic, but also

how these women may beff

helped. .

‘ State control of gun

stores may be answer

A gunman opened fire in a school yard Tuesday with
an AK—47 semiautomatic rifle and killed five children. He
was a convicted criminal, and yet hewas able to buy a
semiautomatic weapon that fires 400 rounds per minute.
'9-i The controversy surrounding firearms and how they are
bought and sold is not a new one. Many states require
a waiting period to allow a comprehensive check of the
purchaser's history. However, not all states require this.

Even a national waiting period would be ineffective in
dealing with this problem. Weapons could still be pur-
chased through underhanded dealers, and law enforce-
ment would be next to impossible.

One possible solution‘, however, is government-

controlled gun stores.

I  The Pennsylvania government controls drugs and alco-

hol. Why not guns? With the elimination of the "middle
man (the private gun sellers), the government could have
direct control of the firearms market and.would be much
more effective in preventing the selling of guns to con-

victs or known hoodlums.

The objective of such a move would not be to restrict
the right of law-abiding citizens to buy arms. In fact,~it

gwould probably take a government-managed outlet less

time to check a buyer's record than it would take a pri-

‘ vate one. But it would allow better enforcement of the

gun laws now in exsistence. Most important, it would pro-

tect a person's right to live.

  George Bush's $25 million partyafact, notopinion

In response to the latest Pitt
News front page anti-Republican
headline, ”Bush starts term with
$25 million party,” The Pitt

News has displayed [its] typical .

irrational whining before [it

 knows] all the facts I— the way [it]

approachs all matters concerning
President-elect Bush. It's funny;
after all that was written in the ar-

. ticle — which almost directly im-

plied that we Americans are
confronted with ”another" un-
caring, self-interested,
spending, bureaucratic, partying
(unlike JFK and Marylin Monroe)
and even ”drink spilling” presi-
dent, from the very beginning of

‘fthe Bush term — there is no men-

tionthat the $25 million for the
Bush inauguration party was do-
nated and funded completely by
private corporations, not Ameri-
can citizens. The only victims
from this presidential event are
not American tax payers or the
homeless, but once again The
Pitt News, strictly due to [its] own
sheer stupidity and habit of print-

 ing any anti-Bush headline before

 

revealing all the facts.

A ban on the word ’awuknwak’

It is interesting to note that John
Berger's essay on human suffer-
ing, ”The evil that men do...”
Uan. 16], comes in the same is-
sue as his article on the shanty
built in front of the William Pitt
Union to attract attention to the
plight of the homeless. He report-
ed on. the impoverished and
man's taking the responsibility to
help his fellow man, and then
asked some ‘thoughtful, lucid

questions about a God. seeming-
ly indifferent to the pain one man
causes another.

William Young, ‘however,
ridicules this theological question
(”...isn’t worth wasting my breath
on”), recognizing only that suffer-
ing exists, and then flippantly
throwing up his hands in disin-
terest. Some» of the world's
greatest minds — David Hume,
Bertrand Russell, Gottfried Leib-
niz, etc. — have ruminated on the
existence of evil in a world
watched over by a benevolent
god. While exceptional minds
 continue fn nnnrlnr this queg.

After rereading the article, my
attention was caught by (for those
keeping score it is in the third
paragraph) the phrase ”the big-
gest and most expensive inaugu-
ration in U.S. history.”

I had my focus. After carefully
choosing my words, I ran out the
headline Bush starts term with
$25 million party.

This isan objective headline.
The truth is that the Bush party is
going to cost $25 million.-It is a
fact — etched in stone. It is not
an opinion. ~

This column is.

So, all right, the $25 millio
was donated by private corpora-
tions and not citizens. Gee, I
wonder why? I can just see it
now.

Fade to the Oval Office.
Bush Aide: Mr. President, Rowan
Shenstein from Automated

A Productives would like you to

contract his company for the
production of Army wrenches.
George: Can you brief me on
why he is the optimum choice?
Bush Aide: Well, his donation for
the inauguration party helped pay
for the gold-encrusted napkin
rings.

tion, Wi|liam_Young will avoid
the issue because it ”only results
in depressing people and
depressing conversation.”
More disturbing than this vacu-
ous concern is Mr. Young's pas-
sive acceptance of human
suffering. He says, ”...there real-
ly isn't a damn thing anybody can
do about.it besides putting up
with it.” The students sleeping in
the shanty in front of the WPU in
an effort to raise the collective

consciousness of the university —

as well as food and clothing for
the homeless — would beg to
differ. Consider also the courage
of Bishop Desmond Tutu and the
late Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.].

”Awuknwak,” whether uttered
by New Guineans or Pittsbur-
ghers, translates as apathy and
blind acceptance. In an age when
man seems more able than ever
to unscrupulously and technolog-
ically inflict suffering on his fel-
low man, this is a dangerous —
if not lethal — attitude.

Fred Hetzel Jr.
CA5 '89

George: Turning away in his
chair, fingers tapping. I'll take
that into consideration.

Ridiculous? Maybe, I but why
would companies contribute
money to the party in the first
place? From what I gather,
George will not be able to sport
an ”Al’s Trucks” sticker on his
lapel, despite Al's contribution to
the January party.

And what of the contributions
themselves?

The amount to be spent on the
celebration is asinine. In the let-
ter, the first two groups men-
tioned when speaking about
”victims” were the ”tax payers or
the homeless." If I were George

I Bush, and thank God I'm not, I

would have a little trouble sleep-
ing if they were planning a $25
million party for me, and I could
look right out of my lavish White
House dorm room and see men

and women who didn't have the I

luxury of a toilet seat.

Perhaps that is something soon-
to-be ”King” George could do.
He could take some of the money
donated for his party and do a
crazy thing like pump a couple
million into the homeless. relief

 

 

Holiday shouldn't be moved

I don't know if many of you
realize that a celebration of a
great man's birthday has been
changed by the university. Not by
the United States government,
but by the University of Pitts-
burgh administration. It makes
me wonder if [it] can move any
other holiday to another day just
for [purposes of convenience].

Our government originally had
set aside the third Monday in
January to celebrate Dr. King's
birthday. Yet our university
chooses a Friday, four days later,
to honor him. If you ask me, this
is not honoring a great man but
slapping him, and those who be-
lieve in his dream, in the face.
Without Dr. King's efforts in civil

rights, many of us, black and .

white, would not enjoy some of
the rights we have today. I think
every student who believes in the

_ views of Dr. King should show ‘
some sign of protest toward the J
. administration, to let [it] know

this will not go unnoticed.

Anthony Scott .

effort. C’mon, take out $10 mil-
lion, that still leaves you enough
of a kitty to buy 550,000 kegs of
Budweiser, 30,000 fifths of Jack
Daniels, and $5,000
munchies.

Or even better, forget the
bureaucracy. Invite all of the
homeless people you can find to
the party. Give them a party. No,

I've got to stop, it's apparent I've J

lost my head.

Basically, the point of this
column is that whether The Pitt
News is forjor against George
Bush is academic. And as a news
editor, I can say that any personal

feelings about George Bush are .

saved for the Perspective page.

Paul, if you reanalyze the con-

tents of our newspaper since the - 5

you will find that the trite modi-

fier ”sheer stupidity” is simply « ' I

not the case.

THE PITTPNEWS, Thursday, January l9, T989

By Patricia Lomando White
Staff Writer

America, a wealthy land,
where any who sought it could
realize the promise of freedom
and opportunity: It is to this land
of riches and promises that, in
1909, Haskell Harelik comes,
leaving his beloved ”Mother Rus-
sia” in search of this freedom and
a new life.

The play, The Immigrant: A
Hamilton County Album, written
by Mark Harelik, premiered at
the Denver Center Theatre Com-
pany in 1985. A true story, it tells
of Harelik’s_, grandfather's im-
migration from Russia to Gal-
veston, Texas.

_ In a plan developed by philan-
thropist Jacob H. Schiff, many
Jewish immigrants were being
redirected to Southwestern states
to alleviate ghetto conditions in

the large Eastern port cities.

The play, which opened at the
Pittsburgh Public Theater last
Wednesday, is impossible to talk
about without first describing the
uniquely functional set designed
by Kevin Rupnik. The dark,
wooden rolling planks on the
stage, and the bushes to the sides,
give the impressiqtggof the out-
doors, while the nearly invisible
tracks in the floor allow furniture
to be brought on and off stage
mechanically, creating the
indoors. ,

At the back of the stage is a
porch, behind «which a white,
wooden wall reaches nearly to
the theater's ceiling. This serves
as the front of the house as well
as a projection screen.

On this screen, the story be-
gins. Pictures from Harelik’s fami-
ly album and those depicting the
slaughter ofJews, taking place in
Russia at the time, appear on the
back wall. A boat's whistle, and
a photograph of thousands‘ of im-
migrants on the banks of their
new land. A flash of light, and a
man silhouetted at the front of the
stage. _

Through the clever use of pho-
tographs and effects, the au-
dience learns a brief history in a
few short minutes. The man in sil-
houtte, looking into the darkness

-and the unknown, makes us feel

the fear and loneliness of the im-
migrant in a strange land.
Once again a photograph. This
time a house, signaling a change
in setting. Haskell (Bruce No-
zick), his only English:
” ’Pananas,’ a penny a piece,”
wheels a cart full of bananas in
front of the Perry house. .
lma Perry'(Carole Lockwood),
a Christian woman and wife of
the town's banker, Milton
(Richard_Thomsen), gives Haskell
some water and buys a few

 

   
  

an

AHamiltonCountyAlbum  

 

bananas, despite her husband's
objections. The next day lma
again meets Haskell, this time in
the marketplace. Later that even-
ing, Haskell comes to the Perrys’
home asking for a-room. Milton
initially protests, but lma per-
suades him to let Haskell stay.
As time passes, the Perrys be-
come more and more supportive
of Haskell, practically adopting

V him as a son. While only men-

tioned, the Perrys have lost two
sons 4 one through death and
one due to separation. This could
account for their attachment to
Haskell.

We see their parental concern
when several neighborhood
toughs shoot at Haskell while he
is peddling his fruit. The Perrys
then help him to open a perma-
nent store. Their frustration and
hurt is apparent when Haskell in-
troduces the unknowing Perrys to

A mixed bag, but more good news than bad news this time. First
the bad news...Craig Street's Phantom of the Attic is phasing out
their record stock, leaving Oakland without a steady source of great
independent music. Don't blame record buyer Dave Martin,
however, as he's done a good job‘ of getting the good music to
starving youth. Most records at Phantom are on sale. How's that
for free advertising...Since they reopened several months ago, the
Decade hasn't had a single independent band. Remember Pixies,
Membranes, Agitpop, etc.? Call and complain...WYEP returned to
the air two years ago with a professional but diverse format. Now
their Modern Times show is intentionally trying to become the new
WXXP by playing all commercial music and no independents. One
would think that an independent radio station would want to use
its 12,000 watts to promote non-commercial music. For shame.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday,vJonuary I9, I989

y 59 national stations

By Linda Ryan

For The Pitt News

Move over, MTV! Pittsburgh's
own WQEX is offering exciting
new videos in an entertaining
weekly show called Videospin.

With the demise of WXXP in
August of 1988, new—music fans
have felt displaced. Videospin, a
half—hour show on WQEX (chan‘—
nel 16 on UHF or channel 32 on
city cable) helps to fill the void by

showcasing the latest videos from

a variety of artists. Videospin airs
twice a week: Wednesdays at 8
p.m. and Sundays at 6:30 p.m.
With hosts Thom Downing and
WDVE’s morning DJ Scott Paul-
sen, Videospin presents videos_
followed by brief commentaries
by Downing and Paulsen. In ad-
dition, there is a weekly music
quiz when viewers can call in an-
swers and win prizes such as con-
cert tickets, albums, or tapes.
Videospin is the brainchild of
co—host and co—producer Thom
Downing. WQEX was regularly
using videos asgfillers between
scheduled shows, an_d when the
supply of videos exceeded the
demand, Downing put together a
video show. The idea originated

» in July, and six weeks later (Sept.

7, 1988 to be exact) the first
Videospin was aired.

According to Downing, there is
definitely a niche for new music
in Pittsburgh. ”The popularity of
WXXP was [shown] by the sell-
out concerts whenever a band
was featured on WXXP.”

The difference in ”style and for— I

mat at WXXP, compared to other
stations, was'also a source of
popularity,” added Downing.

While the format of Videospin
is a part of its success, it does not
overshadow the music. Downing
calls the conceptgof Videospin
”MTV meets PBS.”

While Downing insists that
music news and format take a
backseat to the videos, it is the
show’s format that contributes to

.Videospin’s popularity. Both

Downing and Paulsen are candid
in_their opinions of thevideos
shown, yet they are also‘quite
laid—back. Their ”cro'ss talk” is
completely ad-libbed, and the
show itself is not formally re-
hearsed. As a result, the audience

‘feels_”right there" in the studio.

Both Downing and Paulsen ap-
peal to a wide audience, with
Downing attracting the college-
age viewers and Paulsen attract-
ing his listeners from WDVE.

Paulsen, who has been the
morning DJ at WDVE for the past
two years, contributes his
knowledge of the music business
to Videospin. Making the adjust-
mentfrom radio to TV has not
been difficult, but he admits that
while it is awkward watching
himself on TV, he enjoys doing

the show.

Together, Downing and Paul-
sen complement each other.

They do not always like a partic-

ular video, but their opinions are
always interesting. .

Besides videos and commen-
taries, Videospin features music
news, local concert information
and a weekly pop quiz. So far,
audience response to the quiz
has been overwhelming, with the
number of viewer phone calls
averaging 100 per show.

As for concert news, Videospin
highlights both national and local
groups. One local musician,
Norm Nardini, was recently fea-
tured in a live, in-studio perfor-
mance. All of this activity packed
intoone half hour never over-
shadows the show’s focus, which
is on the videos.

is no ”target audience” because
there is no specific kind of video
being shown. In fact, there really
are no labels that could describe
the music, b_ut Downing has ven-
tured to callsthe videos ”progres-
sive, not dangerous.”

There is truly something for A

everyone, both punk rockers and
yuppies alike. According to
Downing, ”When a show has a
balance, then viewers will find
something to grab onto.” I
Obtaining the actual videos is

relatively easy. Five or six record .

companies send videos to
WQEX, featuring everything from
the eccentric to mainstream.
But keeping in line with the
show, Downing chooses the
new, different, or offbeat while
steering clea_r of top 40. For in-
stance, Videospin, featured
Michelle Shocked and Tracy
Chapman before their national

concert debuts. Videospin was

also able to show Neil Young's

, satirical ”This Note’s, For You” af-

ter it was banned by MTV.
Other artists featured on

Videospin have included Timbuk7

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 19, 1989

‘D311  

(.311

By Tim Azinger

Assistant Showcase Editor

'5 Vincent: The Life and Death of .

Vincent Van Cogh is a flam-
boyant portrayal of the world-
renowned painter and his art.
Director Paul Cox combines Van
Gogh’s paintings, background
scenes from the areas where he
lived and worked, and dialogue
from‘ his lettersto his brother,
Theo.

Vincent picks up with Van

Gogh faltering at evangelism. It is
at this point that his artistic career
begins to unfold. Van Gogh
produced detailed charcoal
sketches of the scenarios he en-
countered in hopes of keeping a
sort of pictorial journal of his ex-
periences. With his life in the
clergy having failed, Van Gogh
left home and directed his full at-
tention to painting.

From here, the film labors
through the succession of jour-
neys on which Van Gogh em-

barked, each in an attempt to
expand his artistic insights and
discover new inspirations. Includ-
ed in these adventures are Van
Gogh’s unreciprocated love for a
cousin, his self—mutilation (he cut
his ear off), his fluctuating men-
tal stability and his suicide on July
29, 1890, at the age of 37.
John Hurt narrates the excerpts
from Van Gogh’s letters. His
raspy, downcast voice recreates
a very Van Gogh-like, moody
tone that captures the emotional

t

swings of the artist.

Cox's precise combination of
dialogue, background _ and art
work, each corresponding to the
same time period, renders impor-
tant details that might have other-
wise been overlooked in the case
of simply viewing Van Gogh’s
works.

While Van Gogh’s art has al-
ways been highly acclaimed, Vin-
cent lends a bit of understanding
to hiswork. Hearing in his own
words the moods and inspirations
he credited for his masterpieces
enhances one’s appreciation for
.them.

The film captures Van Gogh’s
severe emotional swings with
fleeting background shots, fluctu-
ating intonations and most impor-
tant, the varying color scheme.
His works mimic his depression
through drab blues and earth
tones and illuminate his joys with
brilliant yellows, oranges and
reds. All of his works become
even more impressive when

viewed on a large screen.
Van Gogh’s dialogue elevates
the film almost as much as his art.

His almost poetic excerpts fill the _'

void of any uncertanties about his
work that viewers may have, His
writing proves to be on the same
literate level as his painting.

Cox has taken care not to turn
the film into a Van Gogh exhibit
by limiting the number of works
that are shown. This seems bleak
at times, but the splendid scenes
taken from the Dutch and French
countryside wholly make up for
It.

Vincent skillfully depicts the
emotions and tribulations that
”starving artists” encounter. It
represents a melancholy genre of
artists who struggle through their
lives, die apparent failures and
then achieve fame after it is too
late for their own realization of it.

Van Gogh died feeling his life
was meaningless, but Vincent

rectifies his stormy, purposeful

existence.

Videospin aired, viewer response
has been excellent. During the
fall and winter pledge’ breaks,
viewers increased the amount of
their pledges. Pledges also came
from non—traditional donors,
proving to WQEX that there is an

audience for a show like
Videospin. '
The qualities that make

Videospin popular in Pittsburgh
have made it attractive to pro-
gram developers around the
country. At the Eastern Education-
al Network-lnterregional
Programming Service conference
in October, PBS executives
gathered to review new programs
being. offered by other PBS
stations.

The annual conference works
like a program fair. About 150
stations were represented, and to
date, 59 PBS stations (represent-

his newly immigrated wife, Leah
(Devora Millman). And like par-
ents, the Perrys feel their trust has
been betrayed.

Mi|to_n’s motivation for assist-
ing Haskell, at times, seems to be
only that he wants Haskell out of
hishouse. Yet, what parent hav-
ing an adult child still living at
home wouldn't want to see that
child living independently?

Under Howard J. Millman’s ex-
pert direction, the actors perform.
admirably, giving life and sub-
stance to Hare|ik’s family history.

The story, while about the

.r"Quthor’s family, speaks to many
Americans whose ancestors

found their way to this ”land of
opportunity.” And especially in
Pittsburgh, a city rich in ethnic
heritage, we feel an affinity to this
play and to Harelik’s family.

Looking at the projected pho— »

tographs, of those often unsmil—
ing faces, stirs within us an
admiration for the courage it took

ﬁhese people to leave all that was

familiar and loved for a strange
new home. Those of you whose
ancestors were immigrants are es-

ing 59 cities) have picked up I

Videospin. Some of the cities that
will be showing Videospin, start-
ing in April, include Boston, At-
lanta, Sacramento, Philadelphia,
Memphis and San Diego. With
59 PBS stations showing
Videospin, there is a potential au-
dience of 32 million television
viewers.

According to Downing,
Videospin is the ”only weekly,
nationally distributed program in
Pittsburgh.” In public television,
national distribution is consi-
dered ”a benchmark of success.”
So tune in and see what fellow
Pittsburghers are talking about.
Don't miss out on the latest mus-
ic videos and remember, MTV
fans: You'll see it first on
Videospin!

Proposal 42 — discrimina-
tion, justice, or catch—22?
According to the initial votes
of NCAA-member institutions,
it's none of the above, merely
a new way to regulate both
academics and athletics in an
athlete's freshman year.
According to Georgetown
basketball coach John Thomp-
son and a now ever—growing
. slew of collegiate coaches and
administrators, it is ”racist.”
The proposal was passed by
a 163-154 vote, and by press
time, another university will
probably revoke its original
tally. _ '
Why? Namely, Thompson.
The Georgetown coach is in
the second game of his self-

MATT
MARTIN

imposed coaching hiatus, pro-
testing the alleged discrimina-
tory nature of Proposal 42.
When a ”name” coach like
Thompson takes such a severe

‘  stand on ‘an issue, people are

bound to stop and listen to the
problems presented.

Proposal 42 was passed at
the NCAA Convention last A
week and will go into effect in
1990. In effect, it will take
away some of the emphasis
put on college athletics and
make academics the primary
concern, at least ideally. A

Under the rule, student ath-
letes would have to hold a 2.0
GPA in a core curriculum of
11 subjects and score a 700
(out of 1,600 points) on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test, or a
score of 15 on thelAmerican
College Test. ‘

Same as Proposition 48,
right?

Uh-uh.

Under Proposition 48, stu-
dent athletes who do not meet
the standard requirements are
forced to sit out their freshman
year of athletics, either accept-
ing their scholarship and for-
feiting a year of eligibility in
the process, or protecting all
four years of athletic eligibili-
ty by paying their own tuition
for, their first year of classes.

By Proposal-42 rules, the
same student would not be al-
lowed to enroll at the given in-
stitution without paying that
first year of tuition, and he
would still lose a year of eligi-
bility. . 2

The problem here is that stu-
dents who will most likely be
affected by the rule, although
not exclusively, are black ath-

letes who usevcollege athletics .

to gain a higher education
and, in some cases, hopes of
a professional sports career
and the financial security that
accompanies it.

THE PITT NEWS

By Jenna Hunter
Staff Writer

Coaches Deb Yohman, Ben
Rovee and the Lady Panther gym-
nasts will have their hands full at
Trees Hall this Sunday, Jan. 22 at
1 p.m. when they host the Buck-
eyes of Ohio State and the Wol-
verines of the University of
Michigan.

”Ohio State has a reputation of
always being one of the top
teams in our region, and this year
should be no different/’. said Ro-
vee in this month's gymnastics
newsletter.

Yohman, in her third season at
Pitt, said that this year’s squad,
consisting of two seniors, two
juniors, six sophomores and three
freshmen, is more than ready for
the season to start.

”We need a meet,” Yohman
said. ”I’m not sure who's going
to be able to compete, but
whoever I put out there will do
real well.”

Despite the flu, some minor in-
juries and youthful experience,
this year's team should prove to
be a promising one, according to
Yohman. , A

The team has a lot of depth this
year and can back up those inju-
ries with all—around competitors
such as junior captain Shelly

__ Sleith, sophomore Carrie Carne-

sale, who is coming back from
major knee surgery last year, and
freshman Jennifer Butkovich,
who brings a high level of
difficulty in her routines to this

' year's lineup.

-Returning for their final season
are seniors Stephanie Megill and
Trish Aser, one of the most'con—
sistent performers on the squad.

Megill is just coming off an in-
jury, but Aser, who excels on
beam and floor exercise, should

continue to be a tough competi-
tor for Pitt. ,
Junior Hope Celani will be a
possible all-around competitor,
as will sophomore Kathy Wallish.
Sophomores Robyn Borchers,
Jeannie Vecchio and Ohio State
transfer Tina Taylor have minor
injuries but will possibly compete
in some events, and sophomore
Yolanda ”Yo” Powell should see
some action on the uneven
parallel bars and floor exercises.
Adding more difficult tumbling
and beam skills to Pitt's routines
this year is freshma '

Women gymnasts open season

zia, an all—around competitor
who will be a strong addition to
the Lady Panthers.

Another freshman, Tracy Jung,
specializes on beam and floor but
will miss the season-opener due
to the flu.

With the experience of the up-
perclassmen and the addition of
the incoming freshmen, this
year's team could be one of the
strongest in recent years, and the
season-opener against Michigan
and Ohio State in particular, will
give the Lady Panthers a good
idea f h stand.

Senior women swimmers leave PS U
Lions with not-so-kind remembrance

By Chris Bosak "
Staff Writer

Before the Pitt women's swim
meet against Penn State last Satur-
day, a small ceremony was held

in honor of the senior swimmers

and divers. They were given roses
and gifts of appreciation for their

dedicated service to the program

over the last four years.
It also signified the beginning

of their last dual meet at Pitt. They

finished their home dual-meet
career on a high note by destroy-

- ing Penn State, 171-129.

The seniors are Betsy Hobert,
Maureen Cleary, Tricia Rickertt
and Margie Paulick.

”The seniors have done a real-
ly fine job of leading this year,
and you always want ‘your
seniors to go out in style,” said
head coach David Belowich.
”The team is following what they
are doing, and they are leading
them in a nice direction.”

Paulick, a diver who won both
diving events against Penn State,

. said it's not a hard taskto help out

the younger team members.

”| just try to let them know
what lies ahead of them and an-
swer any questions they may
have,” said” Paulick.

Riekert, a freestyle swimming
ace, added that she knows how
difficult it can be for freshmen to
learn the system but added that

the younger members have more

to add than just their swimming
talents.

”You have to explain why
some things are how they are to
the younger swimmers,” said
Rickert. ”We all depend upon
Dave [Belowich] as our coach,
but in a way ' we're all each
other’s coaches.”

Holbert, a senior backstroker,
agrees that every member makes
up the team and added that uni-
ty is one of things she will miss
when she graduatesgfrom Pitt.

”You get to know everyone on
the team really well, and when it
comes right down to it, we're all
together,” said Holbert.

Cleary, a breaststroke and
freestyle swimmer, noted the
growing-up process which occurs
during a college career.

”When you're a freshman,
everything is new, and things
happen around_you,” said
Cleary. ”When you get older,
you have to make things happen.
Actually, I can't‘ believe I'm
almost done swimming; I've had
a great time in my four years

here.”

Paulick, a former Big East div-
ing champion, has worked hard
on her consistency and has a
legitimate shot at becoming a Big
East champion again this year.

”Margie has done a whale of a
job for us,” said Pitt diving coach
Julian Krug. ’’-I’m going to miss
her steady diving, as well asher
personality. I've certainly ‘en-
joyed working with her over the

last four years.”

”I have more confidence in
myself now,” said Paulick. ”I
may not be a lot stronger now,
but now I know how to use my
strength. Before, I didn’t.”

In fact, all of the senior swim-

‘ mers have shown dramatic im-

provement since coming to Pitt.
According to Belowich, all the
seniors have swum their best
times in their events while attend-
ing Pitt. " -

However, with all the terrific
freshmen and sophomore swim-
mers Pitt has this year, the perfor-
mances of the seniors are
sometimes overshadowed. But
this does not discourage or cause
any envy in the classy seniors.

”They haven't pouted. Rather,
they're excited for the future of

the team," said Belowich.-

”They’re all consummate team
members. I will miss them all a

lot, and I'm real proud of them.” ’

Pira tes, Bonilla a void

(AP) ~ The Pittsburgh
Pirates said Wednesday that
they reached contract terms
with third baseman Bobby
Bonilla for the 1989 season.

Bonilla, 25, a .274 batter in
1988, is the first to sign of
eight players who filed for ar-
bitration Monday prior to the
noon deadline. Two others
who would have been eligible
for arbitration, pitcher Brian
Fisher and outfielder RJ. Rey-
nolds, agreed to tenns and
avoided filing.

Bonilla was named to the

arbitra tion, sign deal

National League All-Star squad
as the Pirates’ starting third
baseman. He tied Pirates
center fielder Andy Van Slyke
for‘-third in the league with
100 runs batted in, and he tied
for fourth with 63 extra-base
hits.

He was the National League
Player of the Month in April,
when he had a .341 batting
average with seven home runs
and 18 RBI, and in May, when
he was .344 with six homers
and 25 RBI.

(AP) — Pittsburgh Penguins
goalie Tom Barrasso is expect-
ed to be out for a week or two
because ofa pulled groin mus-
cle, and on Wednesday the
team recalled Wendell Young
from Muskegon to replace
him. '

Barrasso, a key force in the
Penguins’ surge to the top of
the NHL’s Patrick Division
during the past two months,
left in the second period of
Tuesday night's game against
the New York Islanders. The
Islanders went on to win 5-2.

”There’s no question it's go-
ing to hurt us,” said Penguins

Barrasso out, Youngin

Coach Gene Ubriaco.

”lt’s a big loss for us,” said
star center Mario Lemieux,
”but we can't look for excuses
now.”

Barrasso was acquired in a
Nov. 12 trade with the Buffa-
lo Sabres. .

Young was assigned to
Muskegon of the Internation-
al Hockey League on Jan. 9.
He played two games for the
Lumberjacks, allowing a goals-
against average of 3.36 in one
win.

ly 90 percent of all athletes affect-
ed have been black.

It has been claimed that the
SAT is racist, using terms and
figures that are not common in a
black household, and as a result,
black students’ SAT scores suffer.

Indeed, the average score for a
black student is 737, nearly 200
points below the average score of
a white student.

If the test is indeed culturally
biased, then many blacks are be=
ing denied the opportunity to at-
tend college, let alone play
collegiate sports, and Proposition
48 and PropQs_a| 42 should be re-
evaluated, if not done away with
completely.

But the entire problem is that
college is ideally designed to fur-
ther an education, and by allow-
ing athletes who have not
achieved satisfactory academic

standing in high school to even]

enroll, albeit without a year of
athletics, an institution stomps on
the rights of students who have
matched or exceeded their aca-
demic expectations.

But the NCAA is faced with the
concept of improving its image as
an enforcer of the rules it creates,
and more guidelines seemingly
make that job easier.

By creating Proposal 42, the
NCAA has put itself in an even
more precarious situation, partic-
ularly considering the recent sus-
pensions it has levied.

Consider this: If a star athlete
cannot afford to put himself
through his first year of school, he
certainly will not be left out in the
cold. An alumnus will undoubt-
edly pay for his tuition every
time. 0

Instead of freeing itsef from the
toil of investigations, the NCAA
committee has actually created a

new loophole for athletes to take
advantage of.

And whether these athletes
take advantage of the Proposa|—42

mistake to upgrade their educa- -

tion or just play college ball is not
the point — it will happen.

Is this a racial issue? It shouldn't
be. The history of the SAT and
Proposal 48 seems to show that
black athletes are singled out in
this matter, but the main concern

here should be the education that 

the student athlete wants.

Duke University has had a per-
fect graduation rate of basketball
players since 1975, and in the
past four years has been one of
the powerhouses of the national
hoops scene. While not every
school has the dual appeal of
Duke, every school should de-
mand the best student athlete it
can recruit, period.
