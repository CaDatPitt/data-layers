Failure Of Amendment Eight
Means Huge Losses
To State Units

Pitt Interests Involved

Registrar J, G, Quick, chairman of
Allegheny county committee for the
General Alumni association Amend-
ment 8 campaign, has completed his
county organization of Pitt alumni
that will work with him during the
drive.

The complete set up is divided into
37 districts throughout Allegheny
county and is covered by 124 Pitt
men and women representatives.

These Pitt alumni will work toward
the swinging of favorable public senti-
ment to Amendment 8 of the state
constitution, and the passing of the
issue at the November 7 polls,

Amendment 8 provides for a bond
isgueof $25,000,000 to defray expenses
of the state for two years. .

Failure of this bond issue will not
only mean a loss of a Federal loan of
$20,000,000 to the state, as the nation-
al government has stipulated that it
will only match funds appropriated by
the states for welfare and relief work,
and seriously cripple hospitals and
welfare organizations, but directly in-
volves the future of state aided uni-
versities and schools, of which Pitt
is one.

John G. Bowman, Chancellor of the
University, stated in a message to_ the
students of Pitt, “The University s
state appropriations, already reduced
by $132,000, will-receive a. further re-
duction of $396,000 (if Amendment 8
fails to pass). _Such_a result would
cripple the University for years to
come.”

Registrar Quick has appointed the follow-
ing representatives in these districts: Brook-
line, Theodore Biddle, Dr. William McClel-
land, Albert F. Randolph; East End and
Morningside, E. A. Batchelder, Stanton 0.

Soph Hop Tickets
Sell At New Low

Price Reduction And Later Hours.

Are Dance’s Added Features

The actual ticket selling campaign
for the Soph Hop on November 3, will
get under way this morning. Assess-
ment is $2.50 per couple, which is the
lowest price ever set for this annual
formal dance-

Arthur Stroyd, C36, chairman of the
committee, announces that guests at
the Hop will be given an additional
hour of actual dancing, The affair
will take place from 10 to 2 o’clock,
instead of from 9 to 1 o’clock as most
University affairs are scheduled, The
change in time has been effected, he
states, in light of the fact that most
couples rarely arrive before 10 o’clock
anyway, and when the orchestra sig-
nature number is played at 1, a gen-
eral feeling pervades that the end has
come much too soon.

Paul Specht’s Columbia recording
orchestra and interiiationally famous
broadcasting unit will play for the
four hours of dancing at the Hotel
Schenley ballroom a week from Fri-
day. Specht will bring with him the
band that was received so well at the
Inaugural Ball in March.

Melvin Vatz, C, and Wilbur Baer,
C, have been added to the committee,
bringing the membership to 22,

Student- Written Show
Is Cap And Gown
Possibility

“When winter comes, can spring
be far behind?” With that thought
in mind, work has already started

ment upon this score comes from

all those having anything in the
way of a book for the coming
show to meet in the Faculty club
rooms of the Hotel Schenley.
There the authors may air their
ideas before the entire production
committee.

That a student-written show
may become somewhat more than
just a myth is intimated by Mr.
Rome in calling this meeting.
Members of the committee, in ad-
dition to Rome, are: Dr. John S.
Ashbrook, known as the “Father
of Cap and Gown”; Dr, Benjamin
Levant, responsible for many a
hit song of past shows; G. Nor-
man Reis, author of last year’s
‘‘All to the Point” book; Gus A.
Schnabel, musical director of the

again feature the Panther radio
broadcast tonight. Going on the
air over WWSW at 9:15 o’clock,
Lucius will appear just as if noth-
ing had happened after his radio
debut,

Directors of the program de-
clare that letters have piled up
amazingly on the Panther desk
since last Tuesday’s initial air
effort. Although most are in the
same handwriting, it is believed
that Hassenplug is generally de-
tested. Accordingly he will be
ready to iiauseate his hearers once
more this evening.

“A prominent member of the

Pitt Students ,

Ellis Tumpson, C36, advertising

manager of the News, is in charge of
a committee sponsoring the ﬁrst Pitt
News Fall and Winter Style show,
scheduled for next Wednesday. The
affair will take place in the ballroom
of the Hotel Schenley and will follow
the procedure set by the Spring Style
show conducted last semester.
Twenty of the most popular women
students on the campus will shortly
be designated by the student body as
models for the show, and will display
the latestand most desirable feminine
clothing in the stock of some of Pitts-

 

bui-gl1’s leading stores. They will be
supplemented by 20 men, also elected
by campus vote, who stack up as the
“sinoothest” dressers at Pitt.

A ballot will appear in the next
issue of the News, which readers of
the paper are urged to ﬁll with their
male and female model selections.
Executives of the News will act as
ﬁnal judges in the elections.

Although arrangements are far from
completed, Tumpson declares that an
orchestra will be obtained to play for
dancing at the completion of the
fashion display. The show will begin
about 2 or 2:30 o’clock, and will last,
about two or two and a. half hours.
The remainder of the time until 6:30
o’clock will be devoted to’ dancing,

Program Covers
Two-Year Period
Says President

Outstanding Sophomore Each
Year To Receive
Honor Plaque

Will Work With YMCA

The Druid two-year plan in de-
tail will be found on page two of
this issue.

 

At the ﬁrst regular business meet-
ing of the year last Wednesday,
Druids, sophomore men’s honorary
fraternity, adopted an ambitious two-
year program for that organization's
work during the ensuing two-year
period. The nine-point outline is the

ﬁrst to be offered by a Druid group
in advancing interests outside of its
regular functions.

Edward l)ll1‘K1l1, C, president, out-
lined the program, stressing the op-
portunity Druids has to come to the
fore by offering constructive help to
men students, “For some years,"
Durkin said, “outsiders have come to
look upon the Druid organization as
one of a. purely passive nature. It is
our duty to prove to everyone on the
Pitt campus that Druids is vitally in3
terested in conducting projects other
than tea dances in addition to our
own private affairs. Our group is
sufficiently capable to begin to rem-
edy the situation this year.”

Foremost among the proposed
points of the program is one provid-
ing for the appropriation of sufficient
funds to furnish and equip a lounge
for men on the ﬁfth‘ ﬂoor of the Ca-
thedral, All men students are to _be

will be known as "The Druid Room.”

Another outstanding proposal pro-
vides for a Druid scholarship to some
meritorious student chosen by, the
University. Proﬁts from Cwen-
Druid tea dances will betapped to
supply funds for this reward, It is
expected that in two years’ time
enough money will have been accum-
ulated to make this Druid scholarship
worthwhile to a. deserving man.

Cooperation with the YMCA in all
of its freshman activities is to be
carried out on as large a scale as
possible to give Druids a more open
chance to come into contact with a
great many freshman men.

The most discussed point of the
program concerns inscribing upon a
plaque the name of a sophomore
outstanding in scholarship, activities,
and character. This point was’?~-_in-
cluded in the Omicron Delta Kappa
program and then handed down to
Druids with the decision that the
sophomore society would be better
able to follow the plan closely. After
several opinions were heard relative
to the membership of the award com-
mittee, the discussion was concluded
by a vote which selected Walter
Rome and Theodore Biddle, assistant
dean of men, and the upper-classman
adviser to Druids, as.the board to
make the selection.

Remaining points of the program
deal more directly with Druids, par-
ticularly in the matter of elections,
which have come under some crit-
icism and scrutiny in the past. Pro-
visions whereby a deﬁnite check will
be made regularly with activities
leaders are expected to keep Druids
in very close observation of each
freshman’s participation in activities.
After petitions have been turned in,
a ﬁnal survey of the petitioner’s work
will be made with the leaders by let-
ter. These letters will be read at the
beginning of each nominations meet-
ing.

A pamphlet containing a history of
the Delta chapter of Druids, and a.
list of names and activities of all
Druid men now enrolled at the Uni-
versity will be published and dis-
tributed to freshmen as part of a cam-
paign directed at the men of the class
of 1937 to foster more interest in
Druids.

Additional business of the meet-

ing dealt with plans for the Cwen-
Druid tea dance, scheduled for No-
veiiiber 15, and arrangements for the
initiation of the three fall tapees,
; Fred Riblett, C, Joseph Rodgers,
 and Leon Wohlgemuth, C, will be
{formally initiated at the ceremonial
;on Sunday evening, October 29. The
ii-ituals will be performed at the Kappa.
Sigma fraternity house on North
Dithridge street.

“Dictatorship” And Recovery
gc OME COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE a dictator-

ship have a ﬁve or three-year plan. We have
no dictatorship, but I believe we shall be able to
reach our objectives in a much shorter time.”

With these words, uttered at the inauguration of Dr.
Gilbert Mead as president of Washington College, Presi-
dent Roosevelt openly makes an attempt to calm the
ubiquitous American phobia of “dictatorship” or any
other change in our “democratic” government. Even the
most subtle departure from time-honored American
methods of doing things in governmental and diplomatic
aﬁairs are cause enough for self-appointed patriots to
cry “dictatorship” or the equally alarming “socialism.”

And while he opens negotiations with the government
of Soviet Russia, negotiations which will result in recog-
nition of the Soviet state, President Roosevelt, by virtue
of statutory decrees passed by Congress in good “demo-
cratic” fashion, stands as one of the most powerful of
world “dictators." The only logical economic step that
could have been taken with Russia, a step which will
mean millions to American industry, is decried as a
move bf “dictatorship!”

When a. certain bewildered Congress met in a fateful
March, President Roosevelt was given the following
“dictatorial” powers:

1. To control and administer all business and in-
dustry in the public interest;

2. ‘Po govern production, prices, proﬁts, competi-
tion, wages, and the hours of labor;

3. To determine the economic policy of the coun-
try . . . that is to say, whether it shall be national
or international;

4. To debase money in behalf of the debtor class;

5. To produce inﬂation in the interest of certain
classes;

6. To reapportion private wealth and
throughout the nation, in his own judgment;

7. To reduce the gold value of the dollar one-
half . . . that is to say, simply by proclamation, to
double the price of everything that is priced in dol-
lars, and to halve the value of every obligation pay-
able in dollars, such as debts, bonds and mortgages,
insurance policies, and bank deposits.

Although these powers expire under certain limits of
time and circumstance, they have rendered the Presi-
dent the most powerful governmental ﬁgure on earth.
The fact that Mr. Roosevelt has seen wise not to use his
powers to the letter, and the fact that he has allowed
industry and business to voluntarily seek recovery may
be the causes underlying the storm that rages about the
NRA program today.“

Whether recognition of Russia is disturbing the funda-
mental capitalist philosophy of our industrial and busi-
ness leaders is at the moment neither important nor re-
levant. The problem today is to get factories, and stores,
and farms in operation, and the get millions of our labor-
.ers, and workers, and merchants at work again.

’ If American capitalist philosophy is going to wait for
a Eurasiatic war, inevitable soon, to boose production;
if the Russian trade agreement is looked upon as a mild
hypodermic to keep things going until the war breaks;
if social planning and social outlook in America are to
undergo the euthanasia of war prosperity; then Presi-
dent Roosevelt's “dictatorial” powers would better be
gilded in gold and saved until sometime in the nine-
teen forties when economic conditions resulting partly
from the next great war will make them again applic-
able.

Are We Still Interested?
Minnesota 7 . . . Pitt 3

ITT, SUPPORTING A FOOTBALL TEAM that is

ranked among the greatest in the country, has de-
veloped a winning habit, and when that happens, it usu-
ally reﬁects on the student body. The Pitt student body
hasgrown accustomed to victory in the past few years,
and has lost whatever interest it ever had in the success
or failure of its team. The team has become a unit, and
the students have become another unit, each one apart
from the other.

In a small college, where the winning habit does not
persist, the team knows the student body, and is really
a part of it. In turn, the student body is at liberty to
speak to and know, familiarly, the members of the squad.
It is quite likely that such association at Pitt would be
regarded as sacrilege. Of course, we cannot blame either
Dr. Sutherland or the members of the football team. The
wizardry of Dr. Sutherland has elevated the Pitt football
teams to a position of prominence, and the football men
have found out that only a small minority of the stu-
dents cares whether the team wins or loses. 1

Several attempts have been made in the past to rem-
edy thesituation. The alleged “pep rally’’ has become
the best known of the attempts to arouse student en-
thusiasm. These have failed for two reasons: the of-
fairs have not been spontaneous, and the persons in
charge haven't made much of an appeal, leaving the
burden on the shoulders of the invited talent. Naturally,
the athletic officials desire the students to back the vari-
ous teams, and as yet, the students haven't done their
part.

Tomorrow anoher “pep rally” has been called in prep-
aration for the Notre Dame game. The big question is
whether the students have enough spirit left to attend in
a body and back a team that does not have a perfect
record and faces one of the hardest scraps of the sea-
son! Tomorrow will tell the story, and a large turnout
will undoubtedly be much appreciated by the boys who
meet the “Irish” this Saturday.

“A Subtle Emanation”
By Saul Weisberg

Editor's Note:—The opinions expressed in this col-
umn are the personal views of the writer and are
not to be taken to be in conformance with the edi-
torial policy of the Pitt News.

HERE ARE TWO PRIMARY FACTS about the pres-

ent setup of American and world capitalism which, I
‘believe, doom capitalism as the dominant form of eco-
nomic organization. They consist of the modern intense
maldistribution of wealth a.nd of the recent constriction
of the world market for manufactured goods. One must
bear in mind these two developments when accepting or
rejecting any program such as the NRA which is hailed
as the possible savior of capitalism.

As almost any economic textbook will tell you, the
only real purpose of capitalism is to furnish proﬁts to
individuals who take advantage of the opportunities
presented them. The more proﬁts the better. The suc-
cessful person while seeking his proﬁts will build and
run one factory, then enlarge it, perhaps buy out or
merge with other factory owners, until he with a few
other individuals will control one or two or more indus-
tries and receive huge incomes. It is, of course, a well-
known fact that the great part of the wealth and the
power of this country rests in the hands of a compara-
tively small handful of persons.

HILE WEALTHY INDUSTRIALISTS are receiving

an ever larger share of the nation’s income, the
great mass of the people obtain only a small return In
money. Now, in order for the capitalistic system to en-
dure and to return proﬁts to the exploiter, goods must be
sold at a price high enough to make transactions worth
while.
ceiving only a low wage and possess only :3. small share
of the total income of the country, their purchasing
power is not equal to absorbing the huge volume of
goods put out. And the 10,000 or so millionaires, having
only a limited ability to wear suits and eat cake, can
buy only a limited or small amount of goods. In other
words, a few men take the major part of the income,
leaving an insufﬁcient income to the rest of the people
to buy the products of industry. As a result, goods are
not bought, factories are shut down, men are thrown out
of work, and we have a depression.

Hypothetically, the above may be illustrated in the
following way: John Smith as a wealthy industrialist or
banker receives an income of $1,000,000 3. year. Richard
Jones, a laborer, receives an income of only $1,000 a
year. Richard Jones spends all his income upon food
and clothing, consumption goods. John Smith, through
the inherent laws of nature, spends only $50,000 of his
income upon consumption goods. There are 40,000.000
Richard Jones and 10,000 John Smiths. Thus, approxi-
mately 40 billions of dollars are being spent for goods.
Meanwhile, products worth 80 billions of dollars are
being thrown on the market. Therefore only half the
goods on the market are bought, the other half is sur-
plus, not bought up, and the depression comes on.

OW, IN THE PAST, the United States was able fre-
quently to move out of depressions and depressions
themselves were not so severe because we usually could
sell our surplus goods abroad. Most foreign countries,
especially in South America, in the Danubian section of
Europe, and in the Far East, were not industrialized and
were willing to absorb our manufactured goods. But one
of the outstanding changes in the world since the World
War has been the rapid industrialization of backward
countries. No longer are we able to export our steel
to Russia or our shoes to Czecho-Slovakia. Those coun-
tries have their own factories and do not want our
goods. As a result, the United States and Great Britain
and Germany and Japan are being forced to sell their
goods at home through this world constriction of market.
But at home, there is no market for the goods because
of the maldistribution of wealth.

This condition is ever growing worse. The wealthy
individual has an excess of income and he spends this
excess by investing it in new factories, which only turn
out more goods with no market for them. And the re-
cent technological improvements only aggravate the sit-
uation, by making it possible for even more products to
be created with no place for these products to go.

How capitalism can solve the dilemma in which it is
in and still remain capitalism I have not the faintest
idea. As a matter of fact, I do not believe it to be pos-
sible. Fascism is a.n attempt to save capitalism from its
impending crash. But I do not believe that Fascism can
serve its function, for reasons which I have not the
space here to give . But, if capitalism is doomed, what
will come next? Communism? Guild Socialism? Some
new form of society as yet unseen? I, naturally enough,
have only suspicions on the matter. But of this I feel
quite sure. That in the next decade or so, we, the stu-
dents of today, are going to witness lots of exciting
things, and take part in many important events.

Letters
To The

Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

Perchance as editor of a large uni-
versity paper you could plan an 0&-
edition of the Pitt News between
football editions devoting itself to a
serious phase of thought. We all, I
believe, enjoy a “luxury” or “recre-
ational" edition devoted to athletics
or fraternities, but at the same time
the majority of students, it seems
plausible to say, have moments of
more serious thought; and an edition
devoted to, say, some phase of the
economic, social, political, etc. life
of which we are all an interwoven
part would be appropriate.

You could, for example, devote an
edition to future outlooks, That is,
something like this: “As an engineer-
ing student, when approached as to
my outlook for the future of my so-
far chosen profession, I say this: ‘A
war is bound to result within the
short future and that will start steel
agoing O, K. and we engineers will
be setting pretty then.’ ”

Such was the reply I received from
an engineering student when I asked
him his outlook. I, of course, replied
that excluding war-possibilities, what
is the outlook? “Well, the present
set-up of machinery can't go on in-
deﬁnitely. There is bound to be a
revolution in the engineering ﬁeld.”

I thought perhaps you would be in-
terested in this piece of news. I
merely cite this one incident, as I
have had many of the same nature
since on the Pitt campus this year,
for an example as to the possibilities
a serious piece of work on the part
of the Pitt News could undertake.

Your staﬁ could collect views from
all types of students, and then pub-
lish an edition of The Pitt News with
representative opinions from students
studying everything from domestic
economics to atomic research.

An edition of such a nature would
be something new and worthwhile,
and few can doubt the fact that there
is room for new innovations in col-
lege journalism.

Sincerely,
HAROLD J. RUTTENBERG.

Add Foerster Pictures

To Nationality Rooms 1

 

Two pictures by Emil Foerster,
prominent Pittsburgh painter between
1850 and 1906, have been placed on
the walls of Room 13-09, Cathedral, of-
ﬁce of Ruth Crawford Mitchell, ad-
viser to the nationality rooms in the
Cathedral. These pictures, which
supplement another work of Foot‘-
ster now in Mrs. Mitchell's office, are
smaller than the large central paint-
ing of the Foerster family, usually
considered his masterpiece.

One of the two new pictures re-
ceived shows East Liberty as it ap-
-peared to the painter in 1872. The

other picture is one of Neville island

in 1880. All these paintings were
given by the painter’s granddaughter,
Mrs. Elsa Foerster Michael. She has
also given the nationality rooms his
palette and some other personal ef-
fects.

No more dumb freshies! At least
that is true about the Heinz House

of averages.

After only four weeks of school,
these coeds know where the library
is, how many women walk to school
daily, how to appear nonchalant when
that certain sorority asks them to go
to lunch, what the history instructor’s
ﬁrst name is, and that the president
of P. D. Q. is Lucius R. Hassenplug.

Persons responsible for all this en-
lightenment are the mentors, who,
under the disguise of the impressive
title, are simply seniors. These men-
tors, each in charge of a group of
6 or 7 freshmen, have been meeting
with their little classes on Fridays

ings the informal air for which the

only be acquainted with Pitt lore, but

Just ‘A Lucky Break’
For Panther Radio

Entertainers
‘When Allen Haid, the an-

nouncer at radio station WWSW,
broke in on that duet number on
the Panther program last Tues-
day night, he saved somebody
about $250. The mixed duet, bill-
ed as “Dottie and Gene,” was a.
welcome last—minute addition to
the festivities and they went on
the air without having had a
chance to check their selections
with the announcer’s list. As
luck would have it, the two chose
“You’re An Old Smoothie," a
number from the current musical
comedy hit “Take A Chance,”
and the gentlemen who wrote
this song had put it on the list
of “by special permission of the
copyright owners,” which permis-
sion, of course, had not been ask-
ed. Immediately, the announcer
went to bat at the mike and
stopped the song, Without bat-
ting eyelashes, the duet came
through, somewhat appropriately,
with “When Nobody Else Is
Around.”

feature of a week of conference dis-
cussions sponsored by Panhellenic

Ta_ano Cops Javelin Throw

 

By Charles Ruch

Twenty—six novice track aspirants
will be awarded twenty-eight med-
als and fourteen ribbons at the track
and ﬁeld get—together in the student
activities building this evening at
7:30 o’clock. The awarding is the
climax to the second annual fall
track and ﬁeld games, which came to
a conclusion last Friday, ‘

Gold medals for ﬁrst-place winners,
silver medals for second-place win-
ners, and ribbons for those who cap-
tured third places comprise the award
arrangement. Every one who com-
peted in the games is invited to the

affair tonight.

The meet uncovered a new star,
who should help future Pitt track
teams. It was Peter Aviziemis, C37,
who stole the show from the other
weight-tossers on the ﬁnal day of
the games. Three times Aviziemis,
former star athlete at Mt. Carmel
high school, trotted over from the
corner of the ﬁeld where the fresh-
man footballers were busily chasing
forward passes, to take his trials in
the discus throw, the twelve-pound
hammer throw and the twelve-pound
shotput. Each time he bettered the
marks of the other contestant.

Aviziemis threw the discus 111 feet,
5% inches; the iron ball 108 feet,
217,‘; inches; and the shot, 47 feet. 2%,
inches.

Eugene Taano, C37, became the
other ﬁrst-place winner of the day
when he hurled the javelin 169 feet,
4 1-5 inches, 9. mark which easily
bested the eiforts of all others in this
event. The only other boy to come
through in a big way was William
Bright, C37, who garnered a. second
place in the discus throw and came
in third in the javelin and hammer
events. .

Coach Olson was well pleased with
the number of entries to the games and
the results which were recorded. “Of
course,” said Olson, “we could not ex-
pect quite so big a crowd for the
‘weight-events as we had out on Wed-
nesday, because a boy has to have
considerable heft to do well when it
comes to heaving javelins, shots and
the like. If, by any chance, the games
did not bring out all those men in-
terested in track, I again extend an
invitation to them to give it a try.
Also, I repeat the invitation to all
those who participated in the games
to attend the track and ﬁeld get-
together on Tuesday night.”

Summing up the results of both
parts of the meet, it is found that
Aviziemis and Robert Gerrety, C37,
head the list with three ﬁrst places
apiece. Close behind the leaders are
Harold Tost, C37, who added a sec-
ond place in the hammer throw to
his ﬁrsts in the mile and two—mile
runs; and Andrew Lasky, Ed37, who
took second place in the shotp-ut in
addition to copping both the hurdle
races on Wednesday.

Results of the ﬁeld events are sum-
marized as:

_ Javelin t.hrow—Eugene Taano. C37, first;
A. B. Shaffer, C37, second; William Bright,
(337 ; third. Distance: 169 feet 4 1-5 inches.

Swimming Strokes Get
Strict Observation
By Pat Corr

Coach Pat Corr is seeking the
aid of the physical education de-
partment and the foremost swim-
ming coaches in the country to
determine whether a peculiar in-
dividual stroke is harmful to a
swimmer from a health stand-
point. He maintains that if
swimming is not beneﬁcial to the
individual or an aid in correct-
ing a physical deﬁciency it should
be dropped from every sports’
program,

To determine what each Pitt
swimmer considers correct form,
Corr issued a questionnaire to
each member of the squad, If
what a swimmer considers cor-
rect form is found to be injurious
by the physical education depart-
ment, he will have to develop a
stroke that the department will
approve, or he will not be per-
mitted to represent Pitt in swim-
ming competition.

closely you may ﬁnd it is concerned
with, of all things, basketball. At the
end of the two weeks’ preliminary
practice, Coach Carlson is issuing to
each of his varsity men a basketball
handbook, containing all the forma-

have been practicing during the past
fortnight.

In order to allow the freshman-
novice tournament full sway on the
Stadium ﬂoor, and to give the cagers
“a chance to study up on their pa-
pers,” varsity practice has been sus-
pended for two weeks and will take
up again in earnest on November 6,
in preparation for the opener against
Georgetown here on December 6.

Defeat Ct Season

Weinstock Kicks Second Field
Goal Of Season For Only
Pitt Score

Pass Scores For Gophers

 

Bernie Berman’s Minnesota gridders
handed the Golden Panthers their
ﬁrst defeat of the season Saturday
at Minneapolis, scoring in the ﬁrst
quarter of the game to triumph 7 to 3,
The Panther score was the result of
a. ﬁeld goal place kicked by Izzy
Weinstock in the second period. The
ﬁeld goal was the second of the sea-
son for Weinstock, who kicked one
against W & J.

The Gophers scored when Francis
Luiid, Minnesota halfback, threw an
underhaiid pass to Tenner, left end,
for 14 yards and a touchdown. Bevan
place-kicked the extra point.

The defeat was the ﬁrst for the
Panthers, save for the Tournament
of Roses whipp-ing last January, since
the Notre Dame game of 1931.

HE GOLDEN CAT’S TWO FLASHY fullback stars who have been

ﬁghting for the Pitt berth through the ﬁrst three games this season.
Both hard-hitting and fast, Heinie and Izzy have been going great guns
in the Panther backﬁeld. With an injured leg, Weinstock has been
playing under a handicap during the last two games, and Weisenbaugh
has been ﬁlling his shoes capably. They’re both set for a certain South
Bend football team Saturday, and whoever Jock Sutherland picks will
give the Irish plenty to worry about.

Sportorial . . . .

By Robert

E. Badger

Pitt -News Sports Editor

It all goes to show how foolish it
is to try to “dope” football. Just for
the fun of it, how many in the room
picked Minnesota over Pitt, Tech over
Notre Dame, Salem over West Vir-
ginia Wesleyan, or Oregon State to
tie Southern California? Howwe hate
to call anybody a prevaricator but
after all. . . . ,

The defeat of the Irish by our
friends across Panther Hollow should
not make things any easier for Jock’s
boys. Never have the two teams
from Pittsburgh won over Notre Dame
in the same season. Plaid teams
scored triumphs over Rambler teams
in 1926 and in 1928. Neither year did
the Panthers meet Notre Dame, In
1930 and 1931 the Irish won over
both Pitt and Tech. Then in 1932
the Panthers triumphed for the ﬁrst
time, and Carnegie Tech was smoth-
ered unler a 40 to 0 score. Thus if
past experience means anything watch
out, Panthers!

The Irish will not be feeling any
too good, as it is. Like the Texans
who remembered the Alamo the Notre
Dame"s players are remembering that
unexpected 12 to 0 defeat of last
year. Add to this the fact that thus
far their record this year is one vic-
tory, one tie and one defeat, the least
impressive record of a Notre Dame
team since way back in the Dark
Ages, you can bet your last activities
key that the Irish won't make the
game next Saturday a pink tea. Don’t
be surprised if some of the boys come
out of the game looking a little worse
for wear,

The big gun of the Not.re Dame
backﬁeld this year is a young soph-
omore fullback by the nom (we
French‘, you know) of Don Elser.
This young man weighs somewhere
in the neighborhood, and what a neigh-
borhood, of 225 pounds. When he hit
the Carnegie Tech line last Saturday
the telephone ofﬁce in East Liberty
was ﬂooded with calls asking whether
an earthquake had taken place some-
wheres near,

The road ahead for the Panthers Is
anything but smooth. Notre Dame,
Centre, Duquesne, Nebraska and Car-
negie Tech have yet to be met. The
