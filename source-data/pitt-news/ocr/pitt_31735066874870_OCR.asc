Salk Serum

Ten million shots of the
Salk polio vaccine have_ ap-

parently disappeared accord- I

ing to di_stribution ﬁgures on
the vaccine. The loss may
only be a discepancy in the

oiﬁcial records but no expla-

nation has been offered to date.
Two weeks ago the Department
of‘ Health, Welfare and Educa-
tion announced that 17,200,000
cubic centimeters of the Vaccine
would be ready by May 1, On
Tuesday, May 3, the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
stated that it had received only

7,200,000 cc.’s of the vaccine for , =

use in theinnoculation of school
children in the ﬁrst and second
grades. This total was short by 10
million shots of the expected
amount of available vaccine.
No Reason
Dr Hart Van Riper, president
of the Polio Foundation, could
offer no reason for the shortage.
Withholding of the Cutter
Laboratories’ vaccine by the
government pending its inves-
tigation by federal a gpencies, ‘
would have little effect on the
national supply. The Cutter firm
was counted on for little more
, than 10 per cent of the avail-
able stockpile. ..
The National Institute of Health
normally takes only twenty-four
to forty-eight hours to “clear”~the
Vaccine for release.
«First shots have "not as yet been
administered to all first and sec-
ond graders in New York and sev-
eral other Northeastern states.
Second, or booster shots are now
‘planned for children of the same
agegroups in Southern and Far
Western states.
Supply is Tight. ~

MARCH ON—Depicting an age long since past, a fraternity
ﬂoat representing Alexander the Great’s conquest marches in a
past Pitt ﬂoat parade held during Spring Festival Week. This
year’s parade will feature nine ﬂoats. Classes will be dismissed

during the ceremony.

Foundation’s supply will be very
tight within the next few days if
the missing vaccine is not forth-
coming. Some of the booster shots
will have to be delayed as a re-
sult of the continuation of the
shortage.

Religion Given
Consideration
With Services

University officials are consid-
ering a revision in the Freshman
Chapel Service next fall in which
the Catholic, Protestant, and Jew-
ish students would have their own
programs.

It is felt that the present service
beneﬁts no one, because the Cath-
olic students may not attend; the
service is inadequate to the needs
of the Jewish students, and it has
been toned down so that it has
little value to the Protestants.

To'replace the Chapel program,

religious leaders an opportunity to
acquaint students with religious
life on campus.

No word has yet been received
as to the ﬁnal decision of the
officials.

Conference In

Puerto Rico

By DON MILLER

“The Caribbeanis advanc-p

ing faster than we think,”.isi
the opinion of Mrs. Glenna!
W. Mars, Pitt associate pro—i
fessor of Public Health Nurs-E

ing and health expert; Mrsj
Mars recently returned from}
the Caribbean Public Health As-3
sociation Conference in San Juan,i
Puerto Rico, where" she spoke as
an advisor from the States.

“There’s been amazing progress
in Puerto Rico since ’48 and even
sinceilast year when I was there,”
she said. The islanders are ex-
tremely interested in the part oc-
cupational health plays in stabil-
izing their economy. '

Mrs. Glenna W. Mars, Pub-
lic Health Nursing, Ellsworth
Center, is speaking on “Pitts-
burgh Report,” WJAS radio
program, May’ 14, at 7 p.m.
about her Puerto Rican trip.

Industry goes tax free till 1960,
but there are strict health require-
ments that industrialists must
maintain for the safety of their
workers. ’ '

Roosevelt Housing Project
H o u s in g developments have
speeded up terriﬁcally. The largest
development for workers is the 50,-
000.-home Roosevelt Housing Proj-
ect, named for our late president.
New rulings are slanted to help
the island-born-industries get into
the swing of things to bring great-
er prosperity. ‘ 0
Besides giving technical aid
during her trip, Mrs. Mars feels

she . did something for U. S.

diplomacy, too. “When I got
there,” she says “the mayor of

San Juan greeted me on my ar-

rival along with important mem-

bers of civic organizations, man-
agement, and, of course, hospit-
als.

 “In my speech during the con-

States needs Puerto Rican help,
since they have no widespread
mental illness.” In America four
out of ﬁve hospital beds are ﬁlled
with mentally sick.

' America Helps Out , . 1

Up to now all they had to do
was to‘ appear a little in distress,
and our government would step in
and attend tothe situation without

cpnsideririg the ' Puerto Ricans. ,

Things are changing for the bet-
ter at last. President Eisenhower
recently appointed a Negro gov-

ernor of Pueto Rico.”

Extends for Two Days

The University of Pittsburgh
has been selected as one of the
ﬁfty test centers for the annual
“Certiﬁed Professional Secretary”
examination to be given today and
tomorrow. Only leading four-year
colleges and universities are

L chosen.

The twelve hour CPS exam will-
extend over two, days and will
include: personal adjustment and
human relations; business law;
economics, business administra-
tion, and accounting; stenography
and office procedures. ,

Secretaries must pass all parts

of the exam before they can re-

MRS. GLENNA W. MARS
Returns from Comm
A :1: at as
Mrs. Mars reports ironically
that Puerto Ricans felt some-
what proud last year when for
the first time in their history a
few cases of polio developed.
She states that statistics show a
high standard of living and polio
seem to go together. -Puerto Ricans
felt that this was a sign of their
island’s coming up in the world.‘
The most moving experience of
Mrs. Mars’ trip was visiting a new
inﬁrmary, built with American aid
high in the mountains of the in-
terior. The whole town had turned
out for her. They had got an odd-
piece band together. I
Band Strikes Up
“After I spoke, the band struck
up the “Star—Spang1ed Banner.”
They were playing it in my honor,

but I hardly recognized it. They’

were playing it like a mambo!”

Our charming health expert
also visited the Negro» republic
of Haiti as the guest of . Dr.
Athenas Bellevive, ,’vice-presi-
dent of the U. N.’s World Health
Organization (WHO) and chair-
man of the Caribbean conference
in San Juan. ’

“I asked to be taken to a voodoo’

ceremony just outside of Port-au-
Prince. Since Dr. Bellevive is well
known we :had little trouble in
seeing the dances. What we saw
seemed no more bizarre or weird
than an American night_club show
on Saturday night.”

Voodoo is part of Haiti’s culture
and is accepted. It’s completely
natural for a native to nearly hyp-
notize himself in a dance ‘lasting
all night» and then go to church
early Sunday morning.

Return to Haiti
Mrs. Mars plans to return to
Haiti where malnutrition is a prob-
lem. In spite of Haiti’s being an
“island paradise,” many workers

582 of these professional secretar-
ies in the United States.

These tests are sponsored by the
non-proﬁt National Secretaries

Association and are administer-

ed by the Institute for Certifying

placing secretaryship on a pro-
fessional level and make it possi-

The CPS examinations are open

ting sugar cane. The law requires
sugar plantation owners to pay
workers unemployment compen-
sation. Maximum wage per hour
for a cane cutter is 85 cents——high
pay according to island standards.

In addition to her work in the
Caribbean, Mrs. Mars worked’ with
the Chippawa Indians in Wiscon-
sin when she graduated as a regis-
tered nurse from the University of
Minnesota, and was also a health
educator for the American Dental

. Association.

A true international cosmo-
polite, Mrs. Mars is often irri-
tated with the complacent, su-
perior attitude of the ‘average
American towards foreigners.
“I’d ratherlive in America than
any other country in the world,”
she says. “But this idea about
America being best in every-
thing is just not so. For instance,
in mental health, we suffer from
lack of experience. We can learn
from other nations how to get
along with ourselves.

Puerto Rico has hospitals for
those born mentally incompetent,
but not one for the mentally ill.
They have no need for one as yet.
If a typical island, a child can live
till he can walk, he is almost im-
mune to anything. Every home
doesn’t have a bathtub, but there’s
a chance to take a dip in the sea,
often along with the barnyard ani-
mals in many places,” Mrs. Mars
added. ’

“Repeatedly I heard:v‘Money‘ is
not what we Want. We ‘want ac-
ceptance.’ They want to be Amer-
ican so much. But are they strong
enough to resist Communism? I
think so, but only with American
understanding. They deﬁnitely
-don't want to be pushed around.”

Teaches Full-Time

Besides teaching classes full-
time at Pitt, Mrs. Mars is working
on her doctor’s ‘thesis in sociology
at the University, and speaks to
P.T.A. and hospital groups on her
experiences in occupaﬁtional health
services. 

Her secret dream is to go to
the Orient, where she has yet to
travel. to help improve indus-
trial health and health in gen-
eral. She would like a founda-

tion to send her to Turkey Per- .

sia, or India. Grants acceptable.

Student Congress to Pay.

 
  

        

 

Delay Of AidiFeared 

The tentative allotment of money to be given by student
congress to the proposed literary magazine and Men’s De-
bating Association has been held in suspension, and may
result in both allotments being cut in half.

In an announcement made by Bob Sedler, S. C._presi-

dent, on Wednesday, it was

learned that unexpected ex-

penditures have caused the delay and possible reduction of

the allotments.

A bill of $60 for Pitt Chest, and
approximately $125 for sending
Miss Pitt ‘to the California Festival
next year, are the causes of S.C.’s
budget tightening.

At last Monday’s meeting, SC
members allocated between $60
and $90 for the proposed maga-
zine, pending the budget report
to the executive committee. An
allotment of $150 was also tenta-
tively smade to MDA pending a
budget report.

At this time it is not known ex-
actly what amounts will be given
to the two groups, nor what effect
this will have on the publication
of the magazine.

Parking To Be

Speech Topic
“The,Parking Situation in Oak-
land” will be the topic of dis-
cussion this afternoon from 12:30
to 1:30 p.m. in the English Room
as Lieutenant Patrick White of the
Pittsburgh Traffic Division leads a

discussion on this much discussed
subject.

Commuting students who drive
to Pitt each day mustcontend with
this difficult situation which -stems
from the University’s location in
the heart of a suburban business
district. Now, with the Pirates
playing home games during the
school week, the situation has be-
come even more dilficult as
Schenley Plaza is parked solid
thereby blocking in students who
park there for morning classes and
would, ordinarily, leave during the
early afternoon.

Admission to the discussion is
free and Lieutenant White will
answer all questions which stu-
dents present in regard to the

parking problem.

H Discussing Religion

Religion is such a personal concept that it requires a.

great deal of individual discretion by those on campus who

I A are afﬁliated with a religious organization. It is an emo-

 

tionaltand quite often sensitive topic to handle. However,
in order for the university to properly administer those
religious programs that have been established for students,
it must be thoroughly and repeatedly discussed. ' '

One of the religious events that has annually confronted

the freshman, and caused consternation among a few, has

been the Freshman Chapel service. Such services have
not attracted the assemblage that they might. Religious
differences is the reason. The Religious Workers’ Fellow-
ship headed by Chaplain Luccock has informally discussed
the problem. '

"Catholic students who have strong belief do not or-

Adinarily attend.services of other faiths because they don’t
_ emphasize their primary ideals.

Jewish students, while
they are not limited in attendance "at services of any faith,
ﬁnd the chapel service inadequate to express their tradi-
tion and ritual. The Protestant student ﬁnds the service
so “watered down” and so-much expression voided in
order to open up services for the others, that it becomes
of little meaning. . ’

For the entering freshman this presents a problem.
Students already established know that for very formal

. services, they may attend those of campus religious groups.

But the freshman feels obligated to attend that traditional
Chapel service and possibly unhappy that such a conﬂict

need occur whether he should go or not. .

Religious workers have expressed a desire for a revi-
sion in that tradition. They offer as a solution, a “Chap-

‘ lain’s Assembly” for the newcomers. At an open meeting,
_ students will be introduced to Chaplain Luccock and then

to each of the chaplains who heads a religious organiza-
tion on campus. An early introduction to these people

might well be the beginning of “Religion-in-Life Week” ‘

friendships being continuous throughout the year. .

‘ After the “Chaplain’s” meeting, freshmen of all faiths
would be directed to services being sponsored by the in-
dividual foundations which have been established for these

purposes. Then, the university will adequately and consid-

erately provide a meaningful religious
ing freshmen. - . .
We like the idea. What do the student body and ad-

program for incom-

T ministration think?

SC Pulls . . .

Another Boo- Boo C‘

By Joan Thomas

The 1955 Student Congress has ended its regime
in true form, abandoning a project that they once
tried to give birth to. Following their proposal for
revival of a student magazine, SC conducted an
extensive poll, results of which showed whole-
hearted student support. And then they dropped
it.

Publications picked it up. Jim
DeWeese made a tentative dum-
my copy for the necessary appro-
val by Publications Board. Print-
ing costs were obtained, bids
were taken, anyeditorial staff was
set up, and editorial policy was
determined. Along the content
line, articles were submitted,
pictures were taken, and art
work was done. And, looking ‘ * ,
ahead to next year’s costs, members of the ﬁnancial
staff are already working on ads.

Publications Board Convinced

DeWeese made the ﬁnal, presentation at the
April Publications Board Meeting. Plans were con-
vincing enough that only three descending votes
were cast out of the 22 present. For once a proj-
ect was not sucked into channels and sub-com-
mittees. If the necessary. funds are obtained, be-
tween 2 and 3,000 copies of the magazine will
be on sale before May 27, last day for graduating
seniors. '

It is the magazine that SC advocated. It would

 

contain full features on Dr. Salk, Chancellor Fitz- V

gerald, varsity debaters, and the new core cur-
riculum. Selected short stories from writing classes
will be included. Human interest will be handled

through such columns as carried by the Saturday ‘

World Affairs Program . . .

Evening Post, passing along humorous (and em-
barrassing) incidents for all to -enjoy. Incident!
will be under headings such as The Perfect squelch.
Life in This University, and Slips of the Tongue.

A Pitt Pride

It will be a magazine that Pitt students can"

really be proud to claim, extending excellent Uni-
versity publicity.
doctors and dentists, many of whom are Pitt grad-
uates, to have in their waiting rooms. The annual
MSS publication, limited by costs to 32 pages, is
an effective spokesman for Pitt. The new maga-

  
     
   
 

It will be available for local K

zine, the University of Pittsburgh Omnibus, will ‘

also be 32 pages, but proposed plans call for 0
editions a year. Six times as eﬁective.

More students will have an opportunity for a
creative outlet. Important, readable features will
have at last found their place in this publication.
Student interpretation on school and foreign mat-
ters will be available to those who persist in duck-
ing out of the classrooms and into the exits.

What SC Wanted

It’s what Student Congress wanted, and more.
Others did the work for them, and‘ now it is handed
over on a proverbial silver platter. They are now
asked only to donate a part of the funds necessary
to complete the project they once supported so
enthusiastically. A

"If they believed in their project enough to jus-
tify expense of printing polls, justify the time of

people passing them out, along with explanations,‘

justify the students’ time of ﬁlling them out, then

_ they should believe in it enough to give it a start.

Subsequent editions would be paid by advertise-
ment. First it must prove itself. And it will. First
Student Congress must prove itself. Will it?

‘This Sorry Scheme’

By Jack Olender

Ah, love! Could you and I with
Him conspire ,
To grasp this sorry Scheme
of Things entire,
Would not we shatter it to bits-
and then ‘
Rernold it closer to the
Heart’s Desire?

—-Omar Khayyarn

-The attitude expressed many
centuries ago by the Arabian
tentmaker is one that is shared
by a good many of us—privately.

But the desirability of publicly
advertising such an emotion is

doubtful. A superior, omniscient, A

savior-like attitude is not con-
ducive to pleasant relations
among men—_-or nations. _
“Mike” Mansﬁeld, a member
of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, was one of the
speakers at the ' ﬁfth annual
World Affairs Forum’ held the
last two days at Hotel William
Penn. As his share of the dis-
cussion on the “Challenge of
Asia,”‘ Senator Mansﬁeld com-
mented upon the United States’
responsibility to Asia in general
and Formosa and the coastal
islands of China in particular.

Not Medieval Days

No Cramming .
-He is of the opinion that way
of thinking cannot be crammed
down a person’s or a nation’s
throat. “Peace cannot be bought.”
It must be “based upon ‘mutual
understanding.” Mansﬁeld cited
the_ Asiatic’s ‘tendency to in-
terpret U.S.‘policy as one of

force.” ,,
According to the Senator, the
Republic of China which is now
holed up on Formosa has no
chance of wrestling the main-
land fromthe Commies. So for

, the Unitedstates toidefend the

off-shore islands, of Quemoy and
Matsu would be for her to be-
come involved in a civil‘ war.
Senator Mansﬁeld would rele-
gate to the background the role
of power in dealing with Asia
and its Communist’ problem.

"lsm's" Detested

Communism has made capital
of any Western act in Asia that
bears. any resemblance to that
most detested of “ism’s” in the
East—Imperialism. Asia is a
century or two behind the West
in bulging her muscles and going
off on a revolutionary kick. Now
that she is ﬁnally awakening,
she does so, not necessarily as a
satisﬁed friend, but more as a

Women - Second Class ? -

By Dolores Fortini

Recently, sociologist Dr. Flor-
ence R. Kluckhohn, concluding
a report by the American Coun-
cil of Education’s Commission on
the Education of Women, stated
that the women of the nation are
now suffering “an unhealthy
feeling of confusion which in
time creates emotional disturb-
ance . . .”

Facing the varied channels in
which the woman today is in- -

_volved, we can, to an extent,
respect Dr. Kluckhohn’s state-
ment. Automatically, the woman
is summoned to ﬁll the positions
of mother—housewife a n d/o r
career woman, culture bearer,
and status symbol of her kin-
positions which might have stag-
gered h er female ancestors.

. Despite these component roles,
she is expected to fulﬁill effort-'~

lessly; she is accused of being

pampered, aggressive and super-'

ior -in attitude.  -
On the other hand, as I. A. R_.

 

Wylie, author of “Candles for
Therese” believes, if ,she does
succeed in these endeavors of
mother, career woman, culture
bearer, "etc., she should be con-
fronted by a" psychoanalyst who
will try to discover what is the
matter with her. -
Sugar and Spice

Her attempts at attaining
recognition in the phase of mas-
culine achievements has erased
the “sugar and spice and every-
thing nice”, and replaced it with
a great big question mark.

No sooner is a woman prom-
inent in the ﬁelds of politics,
culture, or what-have—you, than
she is immediately accused of
being disturbed, as by Margaret
Mead in her article, “What
Women Want” . . . “. . . the
persistent fact is that the most

articulate, the best-educated, the

most mobile group of American
women is disturbed.”

Trying to emerge from the
ancestral woman whgse intelli-

belligerent and resentful
pendent _

To ‘display military might to
aid Nationalist China in any
place other than Formosa and

-the Pescadoras means to‘ attain

the role of a belligerent—a role
which is not looked upon with
favor by the neither-ﬁsh-nor-

. foul belt of countries which ex-

tend in a great semi-circle from

japan, through Southeast Asia
_and the Middle East, and even-

tually up into Germany.

Western Blueprints? .

The “Challenge in Asia” can-
not be met with mere power.
We will have to do more than
just giving economic aid to Asia
and presenting her with blue-
prints—-Western b1ueprints——-for
her development. Asia is poten-
tially powerful and she knows it.

Asia does not want the U.S.
to solve her problems. She
craves for self-expression.

First, we must develop under-
standing; we must try to make
the East and West “meet”. Then
it will be possible to attain a
feeling of mutual respect. And
only then will economic and
cultural cooperation exist be.-
tween the East and the Free
West.

gence became inert from con-
ﬁnement in the home to that of
educated and cultured home-
maker engaged in various act’-
ivities, who can answer her chil-
dren’s questions without-dashing
to the ‘nearest child Psychology

, book, today’s woman is regarded

as being confused, befuddled and
frustrated.
Still A Woman

While gradually becoming 'a
greater factor in the develop-
ment of an industrial nation, this
woman still has that tender
corner in her heart reserved- for
her husband, children, friends,
and even strangers. She’ll still
cower at the sight of a squealing
mouse, still sob in the movies,
still listen to her husband’s re-
ports of his working day; yet, at
the same time, she will be able
to contribute to the conversation,
not ignorant of the world outside
the home. ~ .

It’s time we realized that to-
day’s woman is not a second-
class human being. A‘ "

will be entertained by court
jesters, Squires, and scenes from
their lives.

of the arrangements being plan-
ned by the committee of juniors.

Tuck Shops open.

  Visit Stadium
To Provide Test for Olsonmen

. By STEVE BUTCHOCK .

.Local track fans will get to see Coach Carl ,Olson’s
thinclads at home only twice. this season, andCtomorroW’s
triangular meet with Army and Ohio State at the Stadium
starting at 1:30 pm. should be one of the most exciting

#1 .

in recent‘ years.

The contest looms as one of the Blue and Golds’ most
rigid encounters of the season with both the Cadets and

Buckeyes loaded with star per—¢

formers.

“It’s going to be a great meet
with only the efforts on the ﬁeld

, deciding the winner,” stated Olson

as he looked at the talented per-

V sonnel of the three.squads.

Relay Broken Up
With sprinter Bill Green def-

" initely out for the season because
.. of a spiked heel, the burden has

become heavier on the shoulders
of Arnie Sowell, and the other
dashmen. ‘.
-Unfortunately, on the wake of
one of their most sternest tests of
the ‘season, the Jung1e..Cats have
been forced to break up their mile
relay team that so far has met
with success. ‘
The original quartetiof Green,
Sowell, Joe Dudas, and Ed Saun-
ders now ﬁnds Dave Peays re-
placing the injured Green and
Chuck Fritz taking over for Saun-
ders who has been switched to
the 220-yard low hurdles.
Gridder Leads Cadets
Spearheading the West Pointers
is footballer Bob Kyasky, one of
the best all-around athletes the
Military Academy has ever known.
The versatile Kyasky is practica-
ally a one man team as he is a cer-

tain scorer in the l0O,ijavelin, high
jump, and broad jump. He may
be slightly handicapped at the
Stadium Saturday, however, be-
cause of lack of practice due to
spring football drills.

Although the Cadets have Ky-
asky, they will ﬁeld at compara-
tively unbalanced, team whereas
the Buckeyes have that all-im-
portant pre-requisite required of
a consistent winner-depth.’ The
eight firsts they captured in a
mid-week tuneup with Miami will
attest to ‘that.

George Jones, Lee Williams, and
Alan Roberts head the Buckeye
sprinters. Jones is expected to give

Sowell a real battle in the 880 if he ~

runs the distance in 1:55.6 like he

did this week against Miami. He_

is- also a member of the mile relay
team that has been clocked at less

today’s attempt for their sixth

and one for the whole match.
Chalking up themaximum three

points was Ken Fisher. Other
panthers who broke into the scor-

Team captain Bill Stockdale
amassed 21/2 points and newcomer
Dick Siegal one, to round out ‘the
scoring. The triumph, the linkers’
ﬁfth consecutive after two early-

As Coach Is Hospitalized

 

JIM TULLY
Net mentor hospitalized

*

MIKE BAER

, While his tennis squad has been rolling to victories over
Washington & Jefferson and Duquesne, Coach Jim Tully
has been conﬁnedto a room in Mercy hospital where an
old arm injury has returned to haunt him.

In 1936 Tully,’ then the nation’s number one professional

squash player, had his left arm

‘smashed in an automobile acci-

dent. Today, 19 years and four
operations l.ater, Tully is once
again in the hospital faced with
perhaps another operation.
Playing without their mentor,

the netsters have continued their.

winning ways with 6-3 victories

over W&J and Duquesne. Coach.

Tully is thankful that his arm
didn’t start bothering him severely
until he was able to settle the
Panther’s lineup and have the
team going the way he would like
them to. '

Tully gained, national promin-
ence in 1936 when he won the

United States professional squash
title; The same year the accident
put him out of compettion. After
the second World War Jim once
again entered professional squash
competition and in 1949 he went
to the finals of the Nationals be-
fore being defeated. ‘

In .1951 Tully climaxed a Ben
Hogan type comeback when he
beat Scotty Ramsey to once again
take the U.lS. squash title. In 1953

Pi Lambs Down Kappa Nu, 1-O
On Strength of One-hit Pitching

» BY JOHN BASTOLLA.
Lenny Schnitzer, righthanded ﬁreball sensation of the

. Phi Lambda Phi softball team, hurled a one hit shutout at

the Kappa Nu nine and drove in the only run of the game
as the Pi Lams eked out a 1-0 victory in an IF league game

played Wednesday at the Schen-6

ley Oval.

The Pi Lam pitcher had a no-
hitter going for 5% innings when
Al lWeitz, leftﬁelder of the Kappa
Nu’s, lashed a line single into
rightcenter ﬁeld for the only hit
of theafternoon for the losers.

In gaining his shutout, Schnitzer,

besides limiting his opponents to

one hit, struck out seven batters
and walked only two.

Just a triﬂe less spectacular was
the pitching of Bean Levine, KN
moundsman who after giving up a
single to Stan Stein in the ﬁrst
inning, pitched hitless ball for 4%
innings.

Then, with one out in the ﬁfth,

 Moe Linden drew a walk, Mike

Gruber sacriﬁced him to second,
and then the hero of the day,
Schnitzer, lined a single to center
to score Linden with the only and
deciding run of the seven inning
tilt.

Levine, the Kappa Nu ﬂinger,

gave up only two walks and struck
out ﬁve besides giving up four hits
during the fray. ,

— Kappa Nu’s only threat occurred
in the last inning. With one out
Levine and Hugh Casper drew
successive walks. Irvin Jessie
bounced out pitcher to ﬁrst mov-
ing Levine and Jessie to third and
second respectively. Then Schnitz-
er forced Arnie Silvers’ to foul out,
ending the ball game.

The win for the Pi Lams was
the second as against two setbacks
in league play, while the defeat
marked the ﬁrst loss after two vic-
tories in IF competition for the
Kappa Nu’s. .

D Moving into the second half of
the season, the Panther tennis
squad is looking forward to ﬁnish-
ing as strongly as they started and
completing what may be the most
successful net season in years.

When the servers meet Juniata
tomorrow they will be beginning
the second half of the season. The
ﬁrst half had only one team,
Allegheny, able to top the Pan-
thers. The Pittites record now
stands at six wins and onedefeat.

Wednesday the netters stopped
Duquesne, 6-3, when the city
rivals met at Mellon Park. Harry
Black of Duquesne whipped Pat
Hughes 6-2, 6-3 in the number one
match, but the next four Pittites,
John DeCoux, Herb Thompson,
Art Derbasse, and Jerry Davis all
came through with victories.
Thompson scored a 7-9, 6-3, 6-4
win‘ over Duquesne basketball
sensation Sihugo Green.

Thompson and Derbasse scored
a victory in the doubles as did
Davisand Neil Zwieg. Hughes and
DeCoux absorbed the only doubles
defeat in the match.

Syracuse Hosts M itters Today ‘

Juniata Does Same Tomorrow

By AL PELAEZ
The Orangemen from Syracuse will serve up the curves
and fastballs to the Panther mittersthis afternoon in the

second of a three game road

trip for the locals. The trip

will conclude tomorrow with a game at J uniata.

Syracuse, a new member

to the baseballers schedule,

isn’t expected to give the Lewis-6

men too tough a time as they at-
tempt to continue on their win-
ning ways.

Saturday’s game, however, may
offer the Blue and Gold stiffer
competition. They’ll be facing
J u n I a t a, a
school which

until the Indians blasted Don Mil
ler and Doc Shanafelt, the Pan-
ther’s top pitchers, for a 10-4 vic-
tory.

Ronnie Moog, Carl Lindstrom
and Bob Barrickman are sched-
uled to see action in the week-
end’s activity. Moog will, in all
probability, get the call against
the Orangemen. The sophomore
moundsman will be after his
third win of the season, high for
the Panther hurler.s

Lindstrom and Barrickman will
try for their second victories if
they get the call from Coach
Lewis. .

Defensively and offensively the
Panthers have rounded into top
form. The only weak spot is the
pitching——which tends to be some-
what erratic at times. Like Coach

Lewis commented earlier, “If those
sophomore pitchers come through
we’ll be in good shape.” So far
the prophecy has held true to form
——with sophs racking up four of
the five Panther victories.
Leading the Panther sluggers
are second baseman Ken Krapf
and outﬁelder Bill Schmidt who
are both hitting well over the
400 mark. Schmidt is also the
leading extra—base hitter on the
club.

The play of the infield has also
come in for some praise from
Coach Lewis. “They’ve sure look-
ed great the last few games,” add-
ed the freshmen mentor. Jim

played good baseball and have

Builds Strong Te'et7i’

Good Health Aids Baby

Dr. Samuel M. Wishik, professor of maternal and child
health at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of
Public Health, recently reported that babies’ teeth need at-
tention before birth.

s Speaking before the Annual Conference on Dental Health
at Mellon Institute, the doctor said that mothers must have
“good general health” during pregnancy if they want their
babies to have found teeth.

“We know,” he said, “that a
period of poor health on the part
of the mother during pregnancy
will result in deﬁciency of the
structure of those parts of the
teeth that are being formed at the
time.”

He said that if a baby’s teeth
are checked after they come in,

weak spots can be seen indicating
just when the mother had been ill.

at

Wishik also stressed the fact that
baby teeth should get the same
kind of dental treatment as the
permanent set. Cavities shouldbe
ﬁlled promptly.

The doctor concluded by prais-
ing fluorides.
ﬂuoridation of water such as Pitts-
burgh employs help build strong
teeth in young children through
their mothers.

YOU GET MORE deep-down smoking enjoyment from Luckies
than any other brand. The reason, plain and simple, is that
Luckies taste‘ better. They taste better, ﬁrst of all, because
Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco. Then that tobacco is
toasted to taste better. “It’s Toaste ”—the famous Lucky
Strike process-—tones up Luckies’ light, good-tasting tobacco
to make it taste even’ better . . . cleaner, fresher, smoother.
You’ll enjoy the Droodle above, too; it’s titled: Three on a
match—-Luckies, of course. Whenever smokers put their
heads together, they agree you can’t match a Lucky for ﬂavor.
Come light-up time, enjoy a better-tasting Lucky yourself!

SHOWS IN THE AMERIICARNL
VAL TELL OF LIFE, REAL AND
IMAGENED IN THESE UNITED
STATES.

A CllAlRlVlAN’S MESSAGE

By Yale Rosenstein

Spring Festival —-~ that magic,

word! A word that means sweat,

‘tears, »laughter. The word that
brings out the “carny” instinct
in everyone, participants and
spectators.

This year Spring Festival is
built around the theme of the
“Great 48.” In it we are trying
to build for you some of the gay-
ety an traditions that are ours.
This nation has been known as
the melting pot of the world. The

differences that make this
country great are part of our
heritage. The ‘Montana lumber-
jack, the Hollywood star, the
Pennsylvania Dutch, and the

Georgia “you all” are a part of
each one of us. ~
‘The, basic theme, which is a
close and a very real part of the
students’ life, has been devel-
oped to give the Pittite a chance

Viv.

 

to show «his pride in being an
American and to further his un-
derstanding of American differ-
ences.

The five traditional events of
Festival are integrated into the
idea of the Great 48. Each one
furthers the Americarnival theme
and becomes a fundamental part
of it.

The governors of each state
were notified of our experiment
and have sent us a letter of con-
gratulations and encouragement.
This shows some of the depth of
our purpose and its ready. ac-
ceptance.

To all of you who are particip-
ating in Festival, let me wish
you good luck. To all of you who
will see Spring Festival, let me
assure you of a wonderful and a
most enjoyable experience.

Governors Sent

Letters

The Governors of almost every
state in the “Great 48” have sent
to the University of Pittsburgh

letters of congratulations and en- ‘

couragement. These letters gave
inspiration to the committees ef-
forts. ‘This gives to the Univer-
sity a realization that its efforts
are recognized and an apprecia-
tion of its standing among the
other schools. ,
The-se letters will be displayed

on a map near the adminstration’

  10- CARNIVAL snows .;. 10

1. Alpha Epsilon Pi and Delta
Tau Delta’s show, “Logger Ry-
thyms” opens withl“-Hooray, Hear
Those People.” This is the most
fitting thing I can say about this
show... lSelma, who is in doubt

about a lumber jack sings thr-

sparkling “I’m ‘Not at All in
Love.”

2. Phi Epsilon Pi and Pi Kap-
pa Atlpha do a ‘Hollywood expose’
in “California Confidential". This
show has something different in
many respects. Since it has an all
male cast, we can only think
“who knows what lurks in the cel-
lars of Pitt?” —

3. The Phi Gam and Tri Delt
show, “Drool in the Sun.” has
some wonderful songs. In Atlan-
tic !City Captain Be-mo, is attemp-
ting to launch his electric sub.
The difficulty he has with science
and women make for an interest-
ing show.

4. Chi Omega and Delta Sigma
Phi do ‘iHayseed Holiday.” It 
a bouncy homespun yarn. The

Tau Alpha booth. Sigma Chi will
have an electric gambing wheel
with pandas as prizes. Lamb‘

Chi is selling «Carnival souvenirs.

city girl turns out to be too much
competition for the country. girl
arid. the ‘battle begins. Th-ere is
a professional air about it that
makes it delightful.

5. Alpha Delta Pi and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon do “Kentucky
Babe.” In Mountain De-w, Ken-
tucky we find Dan and Babe.
Entangled in their love is the
Kentucky Derby and a rich col-
onel. Moral——lMon-ey isn’t every-
thing. A

6. Tri isigma and Sigma Pi
show is “On the ‘Slaughter Front.”
Spacemen invade ‘Chicago. The
poor guys are having women
troubles and the show girls from
the Roxy help the visitors. A
drunk, upon seeing this is forced
to give up his DTs.

7. Kappa Alpha Theta and Sig-
ma Chi give their version of “Pil-
grim’s Progress,” or How Far Did
Miles Get? Take a bunch of p-il-
grims, add some Indians, and sea-
son with witches and you have
some real progress for the pil-
grims. ‘What was the name of
that rock?

8. Delta Zeta and Kappa Nu——
“Texas Tempo.” The clock moves
slowly to the dot of twelve. Sher-

10. Phi ‘Delta Theta and Kappa
Gam-ma’s Presentation, ‘“La Louis-

Quarter of New Orleans. With
all the color and gaie-ty of the
can-can the show tells of a new
love. In the background gambling
raids hang in the air, but all ends
well for the college youth in their

“New Orleans ’ Holiday.”
