Night Times Changes;

New Editor

By TERESA SOKOL

Pitt News Staff Writer 7

When the Night Times resumes
publication in July, changes in
policy and distribution, as deter-
mined by the Night Times Review

’ Committee, will be implemented.

The Night Times,‘ which had been
the student publication of the Col-
lege of General Studies, suspended
publication in February when editor
William Means resigned and CGS
found that they had no ‘monies to
fund further issues of the paper,
said Thomas Hajduk, president of
the College of General Studies Stu-
dent ,Cabinet.

The review committee, composed
of faculty and CGS students, has
reestablished the primary function
of the Times, and has also ap-
pointed a new editor for this
publication, said Hajduk.

The commi_ttee’s purpose, Haj-
duk said, was to put the Night
Times on an ‘feven keel,” since,

Hajduk added, “The paper seemed —

Affirmative Action At Pi

By SETH H. LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer

It was standing room only in the
chancellor’s ofﬁce on Monday,
May 18, 1970, as 20 members of the
University Committee for Women's
Rights (UCWR) staged a surprise
teach-in at Dr. Wesley Posvar’s of-
fice. . -

The women’s rights activists who
sat on the carpet and leaned on the
secretary’s desk consisted of staff
and faculty members. Led by Dr.
Ina Braden, president of UCWR,
they arrived unannounced with a
list of demands concerning
discriminatory hiring practices
within the university.

But Dr. Posvar had a number of
other things to worry.about. Pro-

editor.” The committee, which had
been formed in September 1979,
wanted to_ develop continuity in the
publication, Hajduk said.

In an effort to stimulate this con-
tinuity, applications for the
editorial position had been reviewed
since April, said Hajduk. On
Thursday, May 15} the Student
Cabinet appointed Cathy Miller, a’
former editor of Backspace who is
currently earning a second degree
through CGS, as editor of the
Times.

When Miller becomes editor, it
will be in conjunction with a Night
Times with a new goal, said Haj-
duk. The Night Times’ status will
be that of an “official newsletter of
the CGS‘Student Cabinet,” accor-
ding to Hajduk. I

ed as that material which, in a time-

students and faculty from colleges I

and universities throughout the
country. The opportunities provid-
ed fall into two types of programs,
full-time academicdinternships, and
special programs. ‘

The full-time ‘internships are
those which last. for an academic
term, for which academic credit is
given. This program provides
placement, supervision, evaluation,
counseling, special events and sup-
port services. The special programs
are colloquia which combine lec-
tures, small discussions, brieﬁngs
and site visits. These programs

spreading across the country, and
Pitt stadium was being resurfaced
with Astro-Turf at a cost of
$300,000 plus.

The chancellor made. two pro-
mises to the group: he would give
his written reassurance that no
recriminations would be taken
against the women who attended
the teach-in, and he would give a
“high priority” to the study of their
proposals. -

The surprise teach-in was only
one in a series of formal protests the

mative action at Pitt clashed head-
on with established academic hiring
procedures and opposition to any
form of quota system.

Earlier Efforts

Previously, in early April, 1970,
UCWR submitted a formal com-
plaint to Secretary of the Depart-
ment _of Labor George Schultz,
Pennsylvania Governor Raymond
Schafer and Senators Hugh Scott
- and Richard Schweiker.
Supported by statistics concern-

ing the number of women in “top
level” university positions, UCWR
accused the university’ of
“discriminatory practices” in hir-
ing, promotions and admissions.
In addition, the letter demanded
“not only the elimination of present

discriminatory practices but affir-.

mative action such as child centers,
availability of part-time study pro-
grams and a large number of
scholarships for women in areas
where they are currently excluded
or restricted.”

The complaints were then sent to
the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW).
Representatives from AHEW in-
vestigated Pitt in June and again in

October, 1970.

Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic of the University Health
Center of Pittsburgh got a major
boost last week for expansion of its
library with an additional grant of
$175,000 from the Pew Memorial

' Foundation to complement other

local and national grants. Comple-
tion of the new library wing, part of
‘the proposed multi-story Education
and Research Center,— is scheduled
"for mid-1981.

The WPIC Library is one of the
largest and most comprehensive
libraries for behavioral sciences in
the country, serving researchers,
educators, clinicians, and mental
health personnel with over 40,000
volumes, 500 different journals,
and a storehouse of audio-visual
tapes and facilities, according to

(Head Librarian Lucile Stark.

As well as being open to the
public, “people from all over the
-country use research material
here,” said Stark. .

“This will triple our space and
production,” said Stark, who in-
itiated a funding drive for the pro-
ject after it was getting difficult to
accomodate new material and in-

“We were playing musical chairs
with new tapes and volumes,”,she
said. \

The $794,000 expansion will ac-
comodate new facilities for WPIC’s
growing Au"dio-Visual Learning
Center. The audio-visual service
uses tapes for training and research,
stores research material on affective
disorders, nonverbal communica-

film and slide viewing. V

The new facility will provide six 

individual carrel spaces for audio-
visual use,. as well as group and
private screening rooms.

The expansion will also increase
shelf space, provide individual car-
rel study space, and include new of-
fices.

'ing to the Review Committee find-

ings.

The primary goal of the Night
Times will be to provide a sense of
community and a learning ex-

‘ perience for those writing for the

newsletter, said Hajduk.
Hajduk said that the committee’s,

‘ﬁndings had indicated that an in-

dependent ‘publication, similar to
The Pitt News, wouldn't satisfy the
needs of the evening student.

The committee’s findings, Haj-
duk said, also allowed that “the
right of the Student Cabinet Coun-
cil to influence the character of its
own official news organ is unques-
tionable.”

Hajduk said that the Cabinet’s

\

direction of the Times editorial
policy was deemed necessary to pro-
vide ‘CGS stude ts with a newswor-
thy publication relevant to their
needs. '

When the Night Times resumes as
a monthly publication, said Haj-
duk, it will be mailed directly to
CGS students. Approximately 1000
extra copies will also be distributed
on a delayed. schedule‘around cam-
pus, noted Hajduk. A

Hajduk said mailing the newslet-
ter would be expensive. However,
he added that these innovations are
designed to “elevate the image of
the newspaper.” Hajduk added
that publication on a monthly basis
would‘ “alleviate the burden” on
the Night Times editor and staff.

ships will be awarded to students in '

good academic standing who show
a need for financial aid, and will be
awarded over a two- to four-year
period. Medical school tuition at

discussed singularly during each ses-
sion.

The center, established in early
1975, was originated to provide
students an opportunity to integrate
theory and practice in a pro-
fessional setting.

An internship, according to
Sheila Quinlan of the Office of
Cooperative and Field Experience

-,1 Education, is a “structured field
learning experience that com-

pliments a students’ academic in-
terest and field of study while offer-
ing the opportunity to test the
students’ interest, gain exposure to
the actual field setting, and bring
personal experience back to the
classroom. ’ ’ _

The center is growing rapidly, ac-
cording to Sharon Armstrong,
Public Relations Coordinator of
WCLA; from the 50 original

students, over 300 are expected to
participate in the fall 1980 program.

The value of the program can be
evidenced by the satisfaction of

Terri Hoffman and Josie Gagliardi,
both recent participants. Hoffman,
a self-designedtheatre arts major,
found that the experience she ob-
tained was “the best thing that hap-
pened” to her. Placed in the New
Playwrites Theatre for the fall 1979
semester, Hoffman was provided a
work/study situation that Pitt
could not fulfill in. their curriculum.

“I did everything from assistant
directing to stage management. It’s
all what you make of it, the oppor-
tunity is there, so why not use it.”

Gagliardi, on the other hand, is a
political science/Spanish major,
whose experience with the
Spanish/American Legal ‘Agency
Ayuda (translation: help) helped
develop career goals.

“Through the program, I became
certain that I wanted to go to Law
School,” said Miss Gagliardi. “I
also became aware of the need for
bilingual attorneys and found an in-
terest in the field of immigration.”

Other students who recently‘ par-
ticipated in the programtfound the
setting in the Nations’ Capitol a
valuable asset. Franklin Quow, a
political science/urban studies ma-
jor, found the Washington D.C.
setting provided him with a “cul-
tural awakening” and that
“meeting other students with
similar backgrounds from different
parts of the country, while in the
Nations’ Capitol, was very
stimulating.” ‘ .

There has been discussion in some quarters about
including all student media at Pitt under the Student
Publications Media Board proposed constitution.
The proposed constitution, in its present form, in-
cludes only four groups: Backspace, the Owl, The
Pitt News, and WPGH Radio.

Inclusion of the other media groups under the Stu-
dent Publications and Media Board would defeat the
original purpose, of the board, which is to provide

’ funds to four major media groups without these

groups being subjected to a politicized allocation

' process.

~ If more groups are included under the board’s
jurisdiction, the predetermined percentage of the stu-

, dent activities fee (allocated to the board) would have

to be split into smaller proportions. The result would
be chaotic. _ ~  - ,-
First, each media organization would resort to lob-

E112 iﬂttt 157

/

groups that have no business taking part in politics.
Also, the individual media organizations would
receive relatively small chunks of the available funds,
perhaps placing each group in “the red” financially.
The administration has proclaimed that the pro-
posed constitution of the Publications and Media
Board, which has been met with vehement opposition
by leaders of the campus media, was designed to im-
prove student media both fiscally and in terms of
educational value to the students involved.

If all media is brought under the board, each group
will suffer fiscally, defeating one of the purposes of
the board.

While this newspaper fundamentally objects to the
Publications and Media Board proposed constitu-
tion, in its entirety, we hope that the administration
sees fit to include only the four major media under its
jurisdiction, should the proposed constitution be in-

 
 

 

,bying for funds, a tactic which should not be used by

stituted.

By CINDY COHEN

Despite the good wishes that the
people of Michigan had for George

ﬂBush, and the fact that he won the

Republican primary there, Ronald
Reagan now has a dozen more
delegates than he will need to get
the Republican nomination at his
party’s convention this summer.
And the record books could
possibly add a new item in the
presidents’ list: George Washing-
ton—surveyor, Harry S. Truman-—

haberdasher and. . .Ronald Reagan
—actor. The press will have a field
day. And I hope that Shirley Tem-
ple still has some sort of royalties
agreement with the film companies
which will undoubtedly sell her old
movies with Reagan to television . . .

NBC’s next “Big Event.” I wonder.

if, in case of a nuclear attack,
Reagan would preempt himself or
wait fora commercial?

One fact that seems rather
ominous is that Reagan's main
complaints about Carter are ones of

which he himself could be accused.
Reagan harps about Carter’s lack
of federal experience and about his
lack of experience when it comes to
foreign affairs.

But the last time I checked, the
governor of California had no in-
herent advantage in terms of gain-
ing foreign policy experience over
the governor of Georgia. Heaven
knows there is a lack of unity
abounding in our foreign policy,
but as of now, Reagan hasn't any
foreign policy experience either.

Heaven also knows that we need a
sounder fiscal policy, domestically
and internationally, but has there
ever beena time when everyone was
happy with the domestic economic
condition? ‘

Reagan feels that it is time for a
change in leadership and policy,
and as of now it appears that he is
most definitely going to give Presi-
dent Carter a run for his money in
November. - -

But the one query most often ask-

Walter Cronkite As Vice Presideni...lt's Possible Nowadays

_ By EA\R‘R¥ EUNSFORD"

Uncle Walter isn-"t7 running for
vice‘ president‘. .

’l‘~'hat—"st the word from “CBS
Evening News” anchorman, Walter
Cronkite, inregard to a report in
New-‘ Republic magazine that the
veteran newsman would be honored
to join John Anderson's White
Irlousebid. Even though he didn’t
deny the magazine report, Cronkite

announced that he wasn't interested ‘

in‘: running for political? office.
Whenl first heard“ the report that
the newsman would entertain the
notion» of running as Anderson's
vice‘ president on an Independent
ticket, I was elated. I am one of
those millions of Americans who
annually cite Cronkite as one of the

most trusted persons in the country. A

In fact, Uncle Walter has been nam-
ed‘ by pollsters as THE most trusted
person in the country for many con-
secutive years. --
It’s that fatherly (or unclely,x_in
my case) image that Cronkite has

portrayed to his viewers for at least

' two decades that most likely gains

him the support and trust of so

many people. That in itself would '

be a poor reason to have him run
for vice president of the United
States, but that is not the real
reason that the newsman should
consider the thought.

Although he has not had first-
hand experience in government, the
63-year-old‘ newsman has dedicated
himself to five decades of resear-
ching, analyzing, investigating, and

-reporting the intricacies that make

government run. He knows this
country, and he is knowledgeable
about world politics and foreign af-
fairs. ,
Perhaps his ingrained knowledge
isn’t enough to qualify him for this
particular office, but look who runs
for office these days. A former
peanut farmer and a retired
Hollywood actor currently are
guaranteed to be their parties’
nominees for President following
this summer’s national party con-

ventions. So why can’t a television
rlewscaster run for vice president?

In its May 3 edition, the New
Republic reported that Anderson
was considering Cronkite as his
running mate and Cronkite might
accept. The magazine quoted the
newsman as saying: “I’d be so
honored to be asked, I wouldn't
turn it down. It would be the right
party. I've been an independent all
my life.” Cronkite later said that
the article's author misquoted him
and “misinterpreted our conversa-
tion.” The New Republic's ex-
ecutive editor, Morton Kondracke,
said the magazine would stand by
the story and added: “I don’t know
how we could have ~misinterpreted
what he said.”

Anderson, who recently dropped
out of the race for the Republican
nomination for President, also said

‘that the report was not true.

“I have not personally, nor have
I authorized anyone to speak to

anybody to discuss the vice
presidential nomination,” Ander-
son told. an Associated Press
reporter. '

Thus far, Anderson is meeting
with much more success than he
and political analysts predicted in
getting his name on state ballots for
the November election. Although
the Illinois Congressman does not
expect to win the November elec-
tion outright, he does believe that ‘if
the election could be thrown into
the House of Representatives, his
colleagues there might opt with
him. The last time the latter occur-
red was in 1824 when no candidate
among John Quincy Adams, An-
drew Jackson, William H.
Crawford, and Henry Clay gained a
majority of the electoral vote, and
the House of Representatives,
voting by states and with each state
having one vote, chose Adams on
the first ballot. '

The professional pollsters are

reporting that the majority of

Americans don’t like any of. the
choices that they have to choose
between for President, and with the
largest number ever of indepen-
dently-registered voters and with a
heavy cross-over vote in November,
the election possibly could be
thrown into the Hduse. And since
Cronkite has already announced
that he plans to step Qlown as

“Evening News” anchorman early S

next year, he might just change his
mind. In another interview recently
in Parade magazine, Cronkite said
that he looked forward to relin-
quishing the CBS position so that
he could begin to voice his opinions
publicly on national and inter-
national affairs—a freedom he
hasn't been allowed thus far by
CBS officials. He might just decide
that the vice presidency would offer
him the best soapbox available.

And that’s the way it is on May
22, 1980.

 Who Has Rights? Individuals Or Corporations?

By BARRY GLUNT

Freedom of the press exists for
those who own it. Simple state-
ment, like saying that you have to
be alive before you can think. If
human beings want to develop, and
they do, they must be able to con-
trol the conditions of their ex-
istence. Freedom is only freedom
to grow, it is not "freedom to be free.
It is not utopia. It is society.
Human rights are simply the rights
to grow and develop in society.

Who grows and who dies? Look
at it. The answers are in your news-

- paper: Tuition grows, oil company

profits grow, massive white quads
of concrete grow. Student
autonomy is dying along with
enrollments of students from work-
ing class and black families. For
years now, it’s been the 70s, and
student autonomy has been
sentenced to a permanent vacation.
All too often student activists have
slept in the sun ‘by their own choos-
ing, but now it’s becoming an en-
forced fact of life.

Other facts of life: “Nobody
cares, man.” e- .‘‘It’s almost
summer,” “I’m graduating next
year,” “I’m worried about the
draft.” Students are all so split in a
million schools and majors, hopes,
dreams and part-time jobs. As in-
dividuals, it seems impossible to
control the "conditions that deter-
mine our lives.

That’s why the question I of

\

human rights is an important one to
understand. For over two hundred
years, at least, human rights have
been defined as the rights of the in-
dividual. The rights of the in-
dividual are what this country is
based on, right? Wrong. This
country is based on the rights of
corporations to make as much pro-
fit as they can, to grab up and own
and exploit or burn as much land as
they can. Corporations are legally
people, but what was the last time
you saw a major automaker con—
victed of murder, or PAT Transit
of Robbery? What’ was the last
time you breathed asbestos dust or

thought about how cool you’d look

smoking a cigarette?

Civil rights are given to you by
law. Human Rights are yours by
birth. When we try to charge a cor-
poration with murder or a nuke
operator with infanticide, we ‘are
exercising our civil rights. If you

~-protest nuclear power you stand a

good chance of being labeled a
criminal or crazy. A

For the past ten years the Native
American (Navajo) residents of
Burnham, New Mexico have been
fighting a civil battle with ‘Consoli-

dation Coal Company over the con— .

struction of a coal gasification,
facility and stripmine.

Last month, despite court injunc-
tions temporarily restraining them,
Consolidation Coal began leveling
and moving the earth of the Navajo
nation in New Mexico. They began

to assemble the bright orange strip-
mining machines. Within hours,

2‘ nearly 20 persons, including Bur-
jnham residents and supporters ar-

rived at the mine site. Within
minutes, 27 police cars each carry-
ing a pair of cops rode up on the site
and surrounded it. The protesters
moved back one hundred yards
from-the site and set up a camp with
a large tent. A sign on the tent
declares that a new area office of
the “Commission on Whiteman Af-
fairs” has been set up. ’

‘At the camp, 30 plus occupiers
hold meetings

whom face relocation. This is what —

jo nation and the shovels of Con-

Native American organizers now
in Pittsburgh hope to show that the

represents more than “local

Contractors with 50 or more

When the UCWR took their
complaints to HEW, it was not a
precedent. At the time, Harvard
University had already had $60
million withheld under the orders.
But the UCWR complaints were
marginally effective, and measures
were taken to recognize the prob-
lems of women at Pitt.

A University Advisory Board on
Women's Opportunities was form-
ed by the chancellor, drawing its
membership» from women among
the student, faculty, administrative
and staff sgctions. And the deadline
for drawing up an afﬁrmative ac-
tion plan to be submitted to HEW
was speeded up according to Dave
Powers, the assistant to the
chancellor for Academic Affairs at
the time. .

‘-‘The issuance of ' complaints
against the university by the women
may have caused the report to*be
due earlier,” Powers had said in
The Pitt‘ News of November
13,1970. '

Pitt sent in, four studies on
August 17, 1970, but they were

judged incomplete by the govern-
mental agency. And on October 8,
1970, Pitt was given 30 days to
“resolve the deﬁciencies that led to
the termination of non-compliance
or non-responsibility,” or face the
consequences, meaning the federal
government could withhold the
estimated $15-25 million in federal
research grants and monies the
university was expecting.

However, UCWR was dissatis-
fied with the 224-page report
submitted on November 7, 1970. in
a letter sent to HEW on November
16, 1970, Judy Czachowski, the
new president of UCWR stated,
“Our understanding of an Affir-
mative Action plan includes identi-
fyingexisting problems, originating
and implementing procedures to
relieve conditions that exist based
on practices of discrimination. No
goals, time tables or ways to,imple-

ment speciﬁc methods are included H

in the university report.

A“Again, we have been disap-
pointed by the failure of the ad-
ministration of this university to

employment opportunity.

CAMPUS BUS TIME SCHEDULE

The Campus Bus will load in front of the Cathedral of Learning the following times:

take advantage of what we consider

‘to be a unique opportunity to

originate and carry through on a
plan of action that would end
discriminiation here at Pitt.”
Criticism from UCWR centered
on a lack of speciﬁc documentation
of statistics, missing proof of the

/method the/administration used in

arriving at its figures, and a lack of
specific deﬁnition of the profes-
sional positions women hold.‘

UCWR Continues Battle

:,Controversies Mark Development :

“flagrant violation of civilrights,
including that of free speech.”

But David Powers, the spokes-
man for the chancellor, countered
the allegations, saying only one of
the women had actually been
dismissed—three, resigned for
various reasons, one had been laid-
off, and one had not had her con-
tract renewed.

“Prior to the imposition of any
sanctions and penalties, reasonable
efforts within a reasonable time
must be made to secure compliance
through -conference, conciliation,

mediation and persuasion, and the '1
contractor must be afforded an op- ‘

portiinity for a hearing,” according
to the “Higher Education
Guidelines for Executive - Order

, 11246” published by HEW.

The complaint went as far as
HEW, but the university was
cleared in seven of thenine cases

- charged by UCWR.

‘In’ its report to the University,
HEW said that Pitt “was not using
repressive measures to stifle UCWR
complaints of sex discrimination,”
and did not attempt to pressure
women to leave their jobs because. ‘
of their women’s rights activities..

The federal agency further stated
that “the allegations are for the

sex discrimination in job applica-

Cathleen Gentilcore, who had
worked for a year shelving books in
Falk Library, said when she in-
quired into an opening at the cir-
culation desk she was met with the
response that the “job required a
male.”

Ms. Gentilcore said she was told,
“a male was preferred because of
the job dangers at night’. During
the night, not as many people are in
the library and in’ the streets.”

explanations are a requirement in
preparing an affirmative action
plan to be submitted to the federal
government. _

However, the change in job titles
and redeﬁnement of duties by the
university had become an issue in a
class action suit ﬁled by Ms. Gen-
tilcore with the National Organiza-
tion for Women. The university
then offered her the denied job as a
standard practice to the grievance.

Another point that Ms. Gen-
tilcore questioned in the settlement
“proposed by the university was the
compensation of back pay. The
university was ‘willing to give her
back pay from June 1, 1973, to
September 1, 1973. This was the
time a man was hired and filled the
position for which Ms. Gentilcore
initially applied.

The university was allegedly un-
willing to extend back pay after the

resignation of the man on
September 1. Gentilcore’s legal
counselor, Jerry Gardner, had said
he believed Pitt’s logic was
discrimination ended when the man
resigned.

Affirmative Action in the 80’s

And now, after ten years since its
implementation, the affirmative ac-
tion program at Pitt is still alive,
despite all the criticism it has receiv-
ed from numerous civil rights
groups. ,_

The original directorship of the
program was under Edward J.
Blakely, who had resigned in 1974
as director of affirmative action and
director of personnel.

Then the program went under the
direct auspices of the chancellor
when Dr. Posvar appointed Dr.
Maryann Bishop Coffey as director

of affirmative action and assistant
to the chancellor. Ms. Coffey
reports directly to the chancellor
and is not on the staff of the per-
sonnel division as in the past.

Ms. Coffey had assumed her post
on July 1, 1975, after serving as
chairman of the Affirmative Action
Committee of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences.

In 1973, the Affirmative Action
Committee was divided into three
subcommittees: the faculty commit-
tee, the staff committee, and the
student committee.

The three committees maintain’
informal communications
throughout the year, and twice a
year, the three committees meet for-
mally “to give each other
feedback,” according to Ms. Cof-
fey. _ '

“The problems are often the
same.” Ms. Coffey said.
