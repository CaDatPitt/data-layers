President Posvar’s multirnillion-dollar
retirement package is a “shockingly
generous severance settlement," said the
chairperson of the University Senate

budget-policies committee.

Posvar will continue to receive $201,000

of his present $242,000 salary for life, A

along with $3.3 million in university
retirement funds and an agreement by Pitt
to suspend repayment of $700,000 in low-
interest mortgages until Posvar’s death.
The package was approved by the Board
of Trustees in 1974 in attempt to keep

Posvar at Pitt. »
Posvar has been contributing 8 percent

of his salary to Pitt's Teachers Insurance
and Annuity Association/ College
Retirement Equities -Fund, in which Pitt
puts 150 percent of each staff member's

contribution. This account now contains.

$ 1.3 million. Posvar’s second TIAA/CREEF
A is worth $2 million and provides him with

$108,000 per year for the rest of his life,
along with $938,000 in cash, after taxes,

on the day that he retires.

“It just seems incredibly generous,” said
Donald McBumey, chairperson of the

A new dorm “which will be better than
any existing dorm on campus” will be
ready for occupancy by fall 1992, according
to Dennis Donham, Pitt’s' assistant vice
president of student affairs.

The dorm, which is expected to cost
$20 million, will be built over the tennis
courts between the Pi Kappa-Alpha and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity houses.

‘fit will have a cafeteria, study space,
recreation space, larger rooms and a

SGB course evaluation
book off to slow star

The Student Government Board proposed an academic-
review handbook last spring, for the students andlby the
students, to evaluate professors and courses. Little has been
heard of it since, and many students are wondering if the
project is still being developed or if it has fallen by the wayside.

Board member Gil Golden said the SGB has not forgotten
about the handbook, and while students will not see a
handbook in the fall, the project will eventually be completed.

Golden blamed the “horrible” method for distributing
the surveys for the handbook’s slow start. Surveys were
available at the Towers lobby, Towers cafeteria, Schenley Café
William Pitt Union information desk and other campus buildings.

Pitt plans research Withjapanese company

By David T. Welch '
For The Pitt News

The United States and Japan

v often seem to be involved in an

economic tug-of—war, but a
biomedical research
collaboration between Pitt’s
Medical Center and Kanebo, Ltd.,
a Japanese pharmaceutical

corporation, is evidence that-

some cooperation does exist.

The agreement, which
concluded a year and a half of
negotiations, includes two five-
year cancer—immunology
research projects between the
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and
Kanebo.

Dr. Takashi Nose, director and
general manager of Kanebo’s
Pharmaceutical Research Center
and Cancer Research

Laboratories, said in a statement
that he wanted to work with Pitt

 

established. Therefore, we
welcome this opportunity for a
long and fruitful collaboration."

“Why did Kanebo pick
Pittsburgh and not an institution
like Harvard?” Dr. Ronald
Goldfarb, assistant director of
basic research at the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute, asked.

“Because Pitt is gaining
increased recognition as a center
of biomedical research and
science,” Goldfarb said. “PCI has
been named a National Cancer
Institute—designated Comp-
rehensive Cancer Center. There
are only 24 of them in the nation.
We are very proud of this
recognition.”

This collaboration means “a
strong presence of Kanebo in the
United States. Kanebo may put
its American research
headquarters in Pittsburgh,”
Goldfarb said.

 

 

he said. ,

Goldfarb said that in the short
range, he didn't see the
collaboration affecting university
graduate or undergraduate
students.

“But in the long run, Kanebo
could provide students with
summer employment, internships
and lab rotations. The greatest
immediate effect will be
opportunities for post—doctora1
fellows,” Goldfarb said.

There are two joint projects
already agreed upon. The first
includes researching the
stimulation of lymphokine-
activated killer cells, which are
located in the immune system
and can be treated to kill cancer
cells.

The other project involves the
testing of anti—cancer therapeutic
drugs being developed by
Kanebo.

Goldfarb was unsure about
future projects.

“At this point people from
Kanebo are interacting with Pitt
to see where they have common
interests. Their scope seems rather
large, and many possibilities
exist,” Goldfarb said.

Dr. Thomas Detre, president of
Pitt’s medical center, said he is

looking forward to the joint

venture.

“Collaborative ventures in
biomedical research between
academia and private industry
can capitalize on the unique
strengths of both, combining the
rigorous methods of both with
enterprising discovery,” Detre said
in a statement.

Kanebo of Osaka is 100 years
old and boasts a work force of
25,000 employees.

The $3.8 billion corporation is
also involved in textiles, housing,

National Academy of Sciences
selects Pitt biology professor

By Matt Rettger
For The Pitt News

Mary Edmonds, a professor in
the biological sciences
department, was elected on May.
3 to the National Academy of
Sciences, an independent advisory
organization to the federal
government on science and
technology.

Edmonds and Klaus Hoffman
of the medical school’s protein-
research laboratory are the only
NAS members from Pitt. Edmonds

is among 60 members who were 9

elected this year. Election to the
academy is considered to be one
of the highest honors that can be

* ’ awarded to an American scientist

or engineer. .«
Edmonds received her
doctorate in biochemistry from

“ the University of Pennsylvania in

1951, but she got an early start in

A science. Around the age of 10,

ﬁx
1)..

she made use of her brother's

« discarded chemistry set.

“In those days, the chemicals
came in nice wooden containers,
and you could go to the corner
drugstore and get things to mix
together. I liked to see what would
happen. It’s fun — like playing
games,” said Edmonds.

Edmonds completed two post-
doctoral fellowships at the
University of Illinois at Urbana—
Champaign and at the University

(Across from
Children's Hospital)

of Wisconsin at Madison. She
came to Pittsburgh in 1956 and
secured a research position at
Montefiore Hospital.

“I would have liked to have
been a faculty member at the

University [of Pittsburgh], but.

there were no women on the
faculty at that time,” Edmonds
said. “lDoctoratesl for women in
the sciences always existed, but
until you did something
outstanding, the chances for a
faculty appointment were almost
nil.”

Edmonds said that women had
to work ,within the social
pressures against chgoosing
science careers.

“You can’t raise the
consciousness of a whole society
until everyone realizes that there
actually are obstacles. Then we
just said, ‘That’s the way it is’ and
worked hard to show that we
could achieve something,” she
said.

She was hired at Pitt in 1965.
Edmonds said the. biology
department today has as many
women graduate students as men.
She is impressed with the

toughness and organization of
those who manage family,
children and a graduate career.
Edmonds has devoted much of
her research effort uncovering
how messenger ribonucleic acid

(mRNA) works by delivering‘

genetic information in the cell’s
nucleus to the surrounding
cytoplasm. In 1971, Edmonds,
along with Maurice Vaughn and
Hiroshi Nakazato, published a
paper in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences
offering conclusive support for
the theory that heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleic acid (hnRNA)
is a precursor form of mRNA. The
paper became one of the
authoritative works in the field.
Edmonds has been teaching a
graduate course and an
undergraduate course each year
for the past 10 years. “I enjoy
undergraduate teaching; it's
extremely elastic. But cell biology
and molecular biology are such
rapidly evolving subjects that
undergraduates can’t be given all
the latest information without
having the framework to hang it

By Lane Hornfeck
Asst. News Editor

Complying with federal demands for universities to investigate
their research procedures, Pitt has chosen Dr. Jane S. Schultz to
fill the new position of research integrity officer. ‘ ‘

Schultz, an associate professor of pathology, will be responsible _

for coordinating all investigations of ethics in research at the
University of Pittsburgh. ’

“I am working to [investigate] such questions as falsiﬁcation,
plagiarism, fabricationof data and other things that are reported

__ within ‘research. It has nothing to do with the use of funds per

se,” Schultz said.

Schultz said the position was created because of federal
demands for research universities to follow strict procedures.
“Suppose someonewanrs to submit a grant—research application.
They must send along with [the application] information that
says there will be investigations” into the proposed research,”
Schultz said.

Dr. George White, former vice president of research at Pitt,
said, “I believe that there is increased and in some ways

irresponsible congressional pressure on research conduct at the

universities.” - *
Federal rules and regulations “mandate that there be a central

figure that coordinates any activities dealing with investigations -A

Hillman Library, said the new
Polish collection at Pitt is among
the largest in the United States.
A sampling of the items in the
collection is being exhibited in
the lobby of Hillman Library.
Prepared by Oleksy, Rondestvedt

and David Sleasrnan of the Special '

Collections Department at
Hillman, the exhibit coincides
with the 200—year anniversary of
the drafting of the Polish
constitution on May 3, 1791.
According to Oleksy, the
collection’s worth has been
estimated at between $3 million
to $4 million. Hesitant to put an
exact price tag on the collection
before it has been thoroughly

THLE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, May 29, 1991"

examined, Oleksy guessed it to
be worth somewhere between
$40,000 and $3,000,000.

The collection will not be set
apart in a special collections room
in Hillman, but will be shelved in
the stacks. Oleksy said he was
told that it would not be
“economical” to have the
collection in a special area.

Cataloging the collection will
be costly. According to
Rondesvedt, the cost of processing
is between $30 and $50 per
volume. Oleksy estimated
cataloging costs for the collection
to be “$1 million and a half to $2
million dollars.”

“I would like to get to the

Schultz.

Schultz plans to

Pitt professor researches

manipulation of Viruses

By Gregory Flail
For T be Pitt News

The research conducted in Lab 268 of Crawford Hall may be
beyond the scope of those who haven’t been studying molecular
biology for the past 10 to 15 years, but Richard J. Samulski,
recipient of the President's Distinguished Research Award,
believes that his research is not far removed from the lives of
most people, even non-bio majors. .

Samulski, a professor of biology, has been researching the
Adeno-Associate Virus, which in addition to being harmless, is
incapable of reproducing without a helper virus, such as
herpes.

“Through understanding the biology of viruses we can now
manipulate them to do things we consider advantageous,”
Samulski said. “We can take a good gene and put it into a cell
that has a bad gene  Think of all the genetic diseases, and then
you can think of all the potential genes you could put back.”

Samulski’s wife, Terry Van Dyke, is also a molecular biologist.
Van Dyke has been researching the genes responsible for
transforming normal brain cells into tumorous ones. Together,
Samulski and Van Dyke have been encouraging each other’s

' scientific pursuits since graduate school.

Samulski’s teaching, research and marriage are not without
conflict. According to Samulski, teaching and research “are two
full-time jobs. Anyone who says he can do both is either a liar
or doesn’t sleep.” , I

Fortunately‘, Samulski and Van Dyke understand when their
ideal five-day work weeks expand to five days, three nights and
some time on weekends. .

Such schedules are not easily understood by spouses who
pursue different professions. “Scientists,” said Samulski, “are
difficult to love. There’s a factor called lab time. A research
minute can mean two or three hours.” .

Samulski recognized the efforts of thescientists with whom
he works. “It’s like if you were a comedian and you were around
10 other comedians, you’d come up with more good jokes than
if you werekaround a.bunch of preachers.”

Carnegie Mellon University was
ranked 15th in the - U.S. News
survey. Shinn said that there was
no basis for comparing the
programs at Pitt and CMU. “CMU’s
program is more technical and
numbers-oriented, while Pitt’s
stresses a good grounding in the
fundamentals of general
management skills.

According to Shinn, Pitt’s first-
time appearance in the U .3. News

impression that the quality of the
program has rapidly increased.

“We’ve been one of the better-

Although Shinn said that she
was pleased with the Katz School’s
ranking in the U.S. News survey,

she was critical of the survey’s

ranking criteria.
Shinn said, “Ranking 21 program

doesn’t always indicate the quality

University Senate budget-policies
committee. “Posvar has a T'lAA/
CREEF pension, which anyone
else would have  that should
allow him to live very comfortably.
When you add the pension which
he didn't pay into, it seems hard
for me to justify” the retirement
package, McBurney said.

University Senate President
Barbara Shore refused to disclose
the terms of the senate’s statement
concerning Posvar’s retirement
package. Shore said she had
promised the statement would
be released in the University Times
first. ‘ ‘

“We’re expressing very serious
concerns” about Posvar’s
settlement, Shore said. ‘The letter
from the University Senate will
tell state legislators and parents
of students that regardless of
recent allegations of fiscal

- mismanagement, “Pitt’s a good

place and we work hard,”
according to Shore.

McBurney said, “This total
package is worth $5.3 million 
This will cost over $10 per student

per year for the rest of [Posvar’s]
‘ life The extra package, the part
 beyond what any other faculty '

and staff would make, is $4.1
million. What is shocking is that
this has been kept secret all these
years,” McBurney said. “The
board of trustees need to take a
closer look at their procedures.”

Criticism of Posvar’s retirement
package is mostly unwarranted,
said Student Government Board
President Brent Saunders.

“I think a lot of this is being
blown out of proportion,”
Saunders said. Posvar deserves
his retirement package because
of the good he has done for the
university, according to Saunders.
“After 24 years as president of the
university he deserves some sort
of golden parachute.”

When Posvar took office, “Pitt
had a $19 million dollar deﬁcit 
and it was a small commuter
school  Now Pitt’s a large
international university,”
Saunders said. According to
Saunders, Pitt has come a long
way during Posvar’s tenure. “We
need to look at the whole story 
I think people are losing sight of
all the good he’s done.”

McBurney disagreed. “Posvar
wiped out a $19 million deﬁcit. Is
our gratitude for that $4 million?”

“Is this [settlement] worth 24

-years of service? I think it is,”

Saunders said.

But Posvar earned a salary for
his service to the university,
McBurney said. According to
McBurney, a state-supported
university should not pay
administrators the exorbitant
salaries that corporations pay
executives. “That’s the corporate
mentality. This is not U.S. Steel,
Westinghouse or Gulf Oil. That’s
the way they treat their people,”
McBurney said.

McBurney said that Pitt operates
‘on a double standard when it
comes to ﬁnances. “It’s simply
indefensible. We're public when
it comes to sidling up to the
public trough. We’re- private when '
it comes to an outsider looking in
our business. That’s a position
which we cannot afford,”
McBurney said.

But Saunders said Pitt has been
more open about its ﬁnancial
records than other state-related
schools. “The other state [—related]
schools don’t release this
information at all. Pitt’s the first
one to do it. The fact that they
related the information is a step
in the right direction. Penn State
hasn't ; revealed‘ ‘anything -yet,.’’

years.

Pitt accepted 550 students and
enrolled 290. Ninety—eight percent
of the full—time MBA students
graduated in 11 months.

Pitt has placed graduates in
some of the nation’s most
prestigious corporations.

The Ford Motor Company has
hired more graduates from the
Katz School‘than from any other

. school except the University of

Michigan.

Saunders said.

Saunders said that most top-
level universities give their
administrators perks such as low-
interest mortgages. “It seems to
be a common practice.
[Universities] do it to draw high-
level administrators.”

Saunders said he is confident
that Pitt President-elect John
Dennis O’Connor, who will take
ofﬁce August 1, will be more
open about university ﬁnances.
“With Dr. Posvar leaving and Dr.
O’Connor coming in, I believe
Dr. O’Connor will have a practice

of open information to the public,” '

he said. O’Connor was up—front
with the public about the amount
of his salary, Saunders added.

The University Senate will “ask
O’Connor to be more open and
to have more academic values,”
said McBurney.

SGB member Gil Golden said
the retirement settlement “does
sound very excessive. It was quite
surprising — the total amount.
The president of the United States
doesn’t .get such a handsome
retirement package.”

University relations refused
comment on Posvar’s retirement
funds. 1

The US. News survey used the
rankings of academics and chief
executive officers in addition to

‘the numerical data.

SGB'Shinn said she questioned
the validity of rankings by CEOs,
because CEOs may have
knowledge of _a few programs,
but the recruiters who do most of
the hiring for the corporations
are more capable of assessing
MBA programs.

Shinn attributes Pitt’s ranking
to the dynamic nature of the

McBurney said.

“There’s a certain degree
of perks and beneﬁts that
any top executive could
expect, but I don’t really
see how something like
private grocery bills fit in,”
SGB member Gil Golden
said.

Saunders said, “If you go
to any other university, I’m
sure you’d ﬁnd the same
thing  like at the White
House, where the food is
bought with taxpayers’
money,” Saunders said.

But Saunders said he
found it objectionable that
Posvar’s children and
personal staff used the
groceries and supplies paid
for by the university.

University Food Service
also filled food orders for
Posvar. ,

Pitt’s business school will

is that the rankings will naturally

Pitt art history Professor Aaron
Sheon believes he has disproved
the widely held theorythat Dutch
painter Vincent van Gogh
committed suicide because of his
deteriorating relationship with his
brother, Theo. ‘

Sheon obtained 100—year-old
medical records from the curator
of the van Gogh Museum in
Amsterdam. The records listed
tertiary syphilis as the cause of

According to Sheon, van Gogh
thought he was suffering from
“degeneration,” the theory that
each succeeding generation
grows weaker and is in a constant
state of decay. The news that
Theo was in the final, incurable
stage of syphilis also contributed
to his suicide, Sheon said.

Theo supported himself and

recompense, Vincent promised

said Sheon, “that van Gogh did
not have to explain his paintings
to critics or people’s questions.”

Through this symbiotic
relationship, the brothers became
extremely close.

Sheon said this relationship,

“In ‘general, it will surpass the

receptive to the idea of having
students live near them,” said
Balta.

' Josh Kreithen, president of
Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity, said
the new dorm willhelp fraternity

“By housing more students,
the university is giving the
fraternities more possible
rushees,” said Kreithen, '

Donham denied rumors that
the new dorm might be an athletic
dorm.

“This will not be a jock hall.
That does not mean that athletes

will be denied housing there, but
it will not be an athletic dorm.
Besides, I think the NCAA is
outlawing athletic dorms starting
in the fall.”

Construction should start no
later than July, according to
Donham.

“From there, we will proceed
on a hectic, energetic schedule to
finish the dorm,” Donham said.
Pitt received a “favorable
decision” on the dorm from the
City Planning Commission on May
14.

William Harmon, vice president
of Student Affairs, will‘ head a
student committee to hear what
students would like to see in the
new dorm.

“Students for the committee
will be selected this fall. Students

will be nominated from the SGB,

organizations,” Harmon said

“The committee will probably
be 10 to 15 students, and they
will make their recommendations
for specialty considerations at the
end of the term.”

It is true, according to Sheon,
that van Gogh cut off a piece of
his ear and gave it to a prostitute,
but “he did this probably because
of an epileptic seizure. [It was] the
type of epilepsy where the patient
does fall to the ground  In this
type of epilepsy, the patient loses
consciousness but still acts and
talks and walks,” Sheon said.
According to Sheon, van Gogh’s
doctor had other patients with
the same form of epilepsy. A
number of his patients, when

' suffering from a seizure, also cut

For The Pitt News

Pitt Medical Center’s Heart
Institute has begun a collaborative
research program to test an
implantable blood pump for
patients who have end-stage heart
disease and are unable to receive
aheart transplant because of a
shortage of organs.

The Axipump, developed with
Nimbus Medical of Sacramento,
Calif., is unique because it does

‘not replace the diseased heart. It

  is attached to the heart, which

remains in place and survives as

 ~a vital organ. Small, turbine-like

blades in the Axipump spin at
more than 12,000 revolutions per
minute and create ‘most of the
body's blood flow. The heart still
beats, but the patient’s pulse isn't
as strong.

“Between 15,000 and 35,000

4 Americans are in end-stage heart

disease, and there are only 2,000

 , cardiac transplants performed

each year. There needs to be
some sort of
mechanical pump that can
support the failed circulation of
these patients," said Harvey
Borovetz, director of the
Bioengineering Mechanical
Circulatory Support Program of
Presbyterian University Hospital.

Robert Kormos, director of the
Artificial Heart Program at Pitt

’ and assistant professor of surgery,

said, “I see a flve—year time span
necessary for developmental
aspects of the device. In its

developmental stages, the
Axipump may be used as a bridge
device,” which provides blood
flow until a donor organ becomes
available.

Presbyterian University
Hospital usually does around 100
heart transplants per year, but
that figure has not been reached
in the last year due to a shortage
of organ donors.’

Kormos said he envisions a

permanent, entirely implantable A

model of the Axipump. Presently,
the Axipump‘ is powered by a
cable through the skin which is
attached to a console. With an
external console, a knob can be
turned to make the blade spin
more slowly or more quickly,
regulating the blood ﬂow.

“The benefit of having an
external system is that the patient
can operate the pump to some
extent, depending upon his

physiological responses,”
Borovetz said.

Borovetz said that a~
permanently implantable

Axipump would be powered by
energy transmitted across the skin
by a conducting coil. The power
source for the Axipump would
be self—contained. There would
be no need for a protruding cable.
or an external console, but there
would be no way to control blood
flow in response to a patient’s
emotional or physiological state.
Long—term research is being
conducted to modify the Axipump
to accommodate physiological
changes that follow sleeping or

exercising.

Borovetz — said, “To
accommodate for 1_ife’s many
changes is quite a task.'No matter
what you see about these devices,
keep [the heart] You have. It’s the
best you’re ever going to get."

It is estimated that the Axipump
would cost at least $20,000. In a
system where medical funding is
limited, many health—care
professionals have argued that
expensive medical devices which
beneﬁt relatively few patients may
siphon funds from routine,
inexpensive preventive care.
Kormos argued that the
technology isn't the main
expense. The hospital care
needed to keep a dying patient

alive waiting for a heart transplant A

is the greatest cost.

“We've got a transplant ward
with 8 to 10 patients who have
been waiting 5 months for a heart
transplant at -$2,000 a day,” said
Kormos,

Borovetz said research on the
Axipump symbolizes the cutting
edge of man's technological

capacities.

“We should spend this money
because it represents man’s

dreams very much like the space I

program did. Battling heart
disease has been a long-term
goal of 20th-century Americans
just like landing on the moon had
been. There has been pride to
see this technology applied to
give hope to a goodly number of
people who otherwise would not
be alive," he sai_d.

Surveys
' Continued from page I
There was also a full—page bulletin in The Pitt News.

Golden said, “Publication in the fall is practically impossible.
There are not enough evaluations per course. We passed out
4,000 surveys, and nowhere near that many were returned.
You can’t put out an incomplete course guide because it won’t
help everyone, and [if it is a failure], it will be that much harder
to get it started next year.”

SGB President Brent Saunders blamed the late start for the
difficulties the SGB encountered.

“We had to wait until the end of the school year because we
could not ﬁgure who has the power to say, ‘All the faculty has
to do this,”’ Saunders said. “The administration was supportive,
but no one wanted to publicly help us. This dragged on for
three months, so finally we decided to do it ourselves.”

Golden said that while nothing will be published in the fall,
“we [have gotten] some recognition, We are already at step
one, and there will be a step two."

Golden said he wants direct involvement from university
administration. '

“I would like to see the [Office of Measurement and Evaluation,
responsible for Pitt's current academic—review system] to
cooperate, possibly by handing out our survey with theirs,” said
Golden. “The next person I need to talk to is the provost  I’m
hoping he will say, ‘There is some way we can help you.”’

The SGB academic affairs committee is being formed to
compile the information gathered from the surveys.

“Letters were ‘sent to every academic department asking them
to recommend two undergrads for the committee. We got 30
names, and 15 were picked,” said Golden.

l'Jnsettling settlement...

Although Pitt President Wesley Posvar will be leaving
Pitt on July 31, the university will continue to pay a high
price for Posvar’s 24-year term. Posvar’s total retirement
settlement will cost the university $5.3 million, according
to the University Senate budget-policies committee
chairperson.

The retirement package includes $313 million in two
university retirement funds, from which he will receive
$938,000 in cash on the day he leaves and $108,000 per
year for the rest of his life.

The package also includes $201,000 of his present
$242,000 salary each yearfor life, and an agreement by
the school not to seek repayment of $700,000 in low-
interest mortgages until he dies.

The settlement was decided upon in 1974 by the Board
of Trustees in an effort to keep Posvar at Pitt.-. In response
to criticism that his retirement settlement is inordinately
high, Posvar has said he “could have made ‘a lot more
money elsewhere,” such as a major corporation. But
Posvar chose to accept a position at a state-supported

university and never should have required such a large

sum of money to work at a university supported by public
funds. ,

It has been estimated that $10 of every student’s tuition
each year will go toward Posvar’s settlement. Although
Posvar made great contributions to. Pitt, the students
should not have to overcompensate him for merely doing

his job.

Abortion information denied

The Supreme Court has forced the country to take
another step backward. In a 5-4 decision, the court ruled.
that federally funded farnily- planning clinics are no
longer allowed to inform pregnant women of the option
of abortionwhen counseling them. '

If a woman inquires about abortion, counselors must

now tell her that their particular clinic “does not consider .
—.abortion an appropriate method of family planning.”
The only option for those clinics who oppose the ‘

Supreme Court ruling is to reject monies supplied to them
by the federal government. V

By doing so, the government has no hold over the
information_ a clinic supplies to its clientele. "If clinics
refuse federal funds, they will be giving up substantial
percentages of their budgets. In the case of a clinic in the
Bronx, that’s $450,000 annually.

The court’s decision is a blatant infringement onnot
only the rights of women, but on the rights of doctors and
counselors to provide their patients with adequate,
unbiased service which is informational as well.

Affirmative action questionable

On April 8 a-student at
Georgetown’s Law School
printed an article claiming that
the academic credentials of white
and black students at that
university were “dramatically
unequal.”

That law student, Timothy
Maguire, was then charged with
illegally obtaining confidential
records while working as a clerk

at the school’s admissions ofﬁce. ‘

Timothy Maguire was wrong
to print the records he obtained,
but I think he was right to bring

' up the issue of affirmative action

programs on campuses. 'I'here’s
a lot of students nationwide that
need to learn more about the
affirmative action programs, and
how they are affected by them.

Affirmative action means that
some ignore- qualified,-students

' are goinglto be passed up so that

minority students can attend a
particular university.

I'm going, to question
affirmative action, at least until I
see it revised somewhat. In
1989, the total number of all
minorities in the undergraduate
program at Pitt was 2,528, while
their white counterparts
numbered 16,422. Hey, how
much has affirmative action
helped here? For every minority,
there are almost seven whites.

Skip Leezer

Minority students often have '

‘an uphill battle to climb in order
to getinto a prestigious university,
or any university for that matter.
White students often don’t have
to worry as much about money,
but I think this argument is
beginning to fade as the number
of middle class white families
continues to diminish;"'

In an article from the
Washington Post, “Targeting
Minorities For College,” minority
students fight such obstacles as
poor high-school education,
financial problems, poverty,
childhood pregnancy, marriage,
and a ‘need for full-time
employment

Darryl Wiley, the political action
chairperson of the Black Action
Society, says that minority
students find it harder at
universities because of cultural
differences. He says that more
minority students need help to
“adjust to the environment.”

Wiley ‘also said that black
students need more ‘of an
opportunity to learn about their
culture and not to be forced into

— studying about the European

communities. Black and minority

instructors are needed because
they help the material being
studied “relate better to the
students.” \

Could it be that students also
lose interest when they can’t-
relate to their professor?

Definitely! Face it. If you ﬁnd a '

class boring, a lot of the time it’s

because of the way it is presented

by the instructor. 2 _

I’m sure that affirmative action‘

has beneﬁted a lot__of minority
students, but I don’t think that
it’s ever going to stop the disparity
between whites and minorities.

Until the issues of culture, 0.

instructors, courses, money and

such are addressed, minorities. ,

will continue - to be
underrepresented at universities

and more importantly, at the ,'

graduation ceremonies at the end -
of the school year.

To Mr. Maguire, thank you for ' 

forcing out the issue of
Affirmative Action.. Now that it's
out in the open, let's all take a
good hard look at it and see why

it’s not working as well as it '

could. Hey, let's stay open-
minded enough to understand
that everybody deserves the
chance for a better education.

Until recently, I had held former
Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar in

Letters

firm, but when one considers
that the university annually comes

the highest esteem, viewing him
as an under— appreciated man who had rescued a
struggling university from possible fiscal collapse,
and brought the university into the sphere of world-
class educational organizations.

My opinion has been radically tempered with the
shocking revelations regarding Dr. Posvar’s posh,
lavish lifestyle, and his outlandish, stunning
retirement package, all financed by the student
body through tuition, and the taxpayers of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

The words that now come to mind first when I
envision Dr. Posvar are “thievery, greed, plunder
and obscene.”

Dr. Posvar’s lifestyle while chancellor and
retirement package would have been incredible

to the commonwealth hat—in-hand fog heavy
subsidization, government-sponsored “lush life”
becomes something outrageous and infuriating to
anyone who has ever given the university financial
contributions or paid state taxes.

This sorry episode will surely cripple Pitt’s ability
to raise funds, and forever tarnish its reputation.
How sympathetic to the alleged needs of the
university will alumni be when called upon for
support. .

Safeguards must be enacted so that such raping
of university and commonwealth funds never occurs
again. ' '

Madonna bares

By Ross Pasquale
Entertainment Editor

“I can’t imagine Madonna being

‘ I nervous,” a friend of mine once

said to me. Well, imagine it —
along with sexy, domineering,
mothering, rude, funny,
demanding, generous and bitchy
(surprise, surprise). These are the
poses she strikes in Alek
Keshishian’s Truth or Dare, the
fascinating documentary of her
.1990 Blond Ambition tour.
Madonna has been a
psychological litmus test for our
generation; the reactions she gets
from the general public range
from disgust to adoration, and
Keshishian’s documentary
explores as many facets of the
star’s life as she allows -— which
could be many or few, depending
on how one looks at it. Madonna
allowed the Harvard-alum
filmmaker to follow herfor the
approximate seven months of her
tour. His cameras were
everywhere but the bathroom,
and they. even made it that far
during a Venice party where the
mega-celeb confers with her gals
in the washroom.
' It takes an extreme exhibitionist

like Madonna to let someone ﬁlm

every minute detail of her life. But
I kept asking myself after I saw

V the film whether any of these

images were real. Some of them
had to be, right? She can’t be “on”
24 hours a day. Or can she?
Madonna’s skill at shedding
personas, like so many chrysalis,

' is her ticket to the millions she’s

made.- But I really want to believe

Primus .
Sailing the Seas of Cheese
Interscope

Primus’ third album, and their

- first non-independently released

album, is a_, rare gem among
records. To describe their sound
is very difficult. One possibility is
psychedelic funk—rock, but that
really doesn’t do them justice.

Bass player and lead vocalist
Les Claypool describes their
unique sound as “progressive
freak—out music, or even
Psychedelic Polka,” which is
about as good as anyone could
do. V

Spin magazine named Primus’
previous album, Frizzle Fry, one
of its Albums of the Year. Primus
has won Bammies’ (Bay Area
Music Award) Outstanding
Independent Album award for
both of its previous albums. This
year, Primus also picked up a
Bammy for Outstanding Bassist
and Club Band Of The Year, an
award written in by Spin fans.

The band moves smoothly from
groove to a quirky puck chaos to
biting social
commentary. Primus self-
produced the album, and is the
perfect description of alternative
music and that is

that I've seen the “real” Madonna
in at least some parts of this film.
The main theme of the piece is
family. Truth orDare chronicles
Madonna’s delight in nurturing
her mu1ti—racial singers and
dancers as a mother lioness with
cubs. She said that she tends to
surround herself with
“emotionally crippled” people,
and that they fulfill -her need to
mother. Her dancers are all, with
one exception, homosexual, and
she mediates conﬂicts between
the straight dancer, Oliver, and
the gay ones, who attend a Queer
Nation rally in New York. She

band that is easy to get into the
mist time you hear them. When I

i first heard them, I was not sure

what to make of them. I didn’t
tune them out, but I was not
enthralled by them. ~

After seeing them on MTV’s
Headbangers’ Ball, seeing the
video for “Jerry Was A Race Car
Driver" from their newalbum,
and listening to my roommate play
their music, I decided that they
were good no, make that great.

The» band redid the song
“Tommy The Cat” from their first
album, the live Sucle On This, and
Tom Waits made a special
appearance as the voice of
Tommy the Cat. I

The remake is great, but their
original is better because of a
longer intro and the bass solo.
Mike Bordin of Faith No More
fame also makes an appearance
on the album.

The band's social commentary
comes in the form of the songs
“Sgt. Baker” and “American Life."
“Sgt. Baker” is basically a
commentary about how military
life takes the individualism out of
a person and how it can take
away a person's dignity.

“Suddenly it appears to me you
got a bit much dignity for your
own good boy. Yes Sirl”‘ ilnd “I
will rape your personality,
pummel you with my own

each performance. She counsels
them and takes them shopping
and buys them gifts.

Madonna’s need to mother is
contrasted with her need for a
mother, when Keshishian films
her at her mother’s grave for a
private C?) moment. Her brother
Christopher looks on while
Madonna lays across the grave
and kisses it softly. Her recovering
alcoholic brother, Marty, also puts
in an appearance, as do her father
and stepmother.

. Celebrity visits include Kevin
Costner, who she says “has got to
_ go” after he calls her show “really
neat"; Sandra Bernhard, with

“Primus: The last word in undefina

 

philosophy, strip you of your self—
integrity, to make you all a bit-like
me," are the lines that really stand
out in the song. “American Life” is
basically about how we treat the
poor and the immigrants who
come to our country.

What really appeals to me,
besides the commentary, is the
funky bass grooves in “Jerry Was
A Race Car Driver” and “Tommy
The Cat.” It is hard to imagine
anyone playing music like this in
the ’90s. This is somewhat

whom she shares wine and
conversation in Venice, and of
course, Warren Beatty, who
avoids the camera like an STD
while the pop goddess beckons,

.“Warren, I want you beside me.”

Beatty plays camera shy -while
criticizing the very idea of a roving
cameraperson ﬁlming her entire
life. He also observes that she
lives every moment of her life on-
camera anyway, leaving us to
question if it’s all just a show.
Madonna’s actions can be seen
as a test: she’s constantly testing
the parameters of ‘what people
will tolerate. Her concert version
of “Like a Virgin” (seen as a video

reminiscent of the ’70s funk and
disco era. '
I In reality, they defy both
categorization and tradition. With
Larry LaLonde doing things never
done to a guitar before, Tim
Alexander giving the band a
superb drumming performance,
and Claypool working the bass

do, Primus is heading towards a
brighter and more popular future.

writhes in ecstasy and simulates
masturbation and copulation on
a bedwhile her dancers pump
and grind in the background. She
plays “truth or dare” with her
troupe, demonstrating how she
performs oral sex on a mineral
water bottle and daring two of
her male dancers to make out in
front of her. She repeatedly
displays her breasts for the
camera. She tests the people
closest to her by being short with
them. It’s like she’s asking, “No
matter what I do, will you like
me? How far can I go?”
Pretty damn far, it appears.
Madonna is out there at the
borderline of sexuality and
celebrity and is determined to
hold our attention as long as she
can. She’s never too far from the
pulse of the American public, and
she’s too savvy to let us blink long
enough to forget her. Once
heralded as a ﬂash in the pan,
Madonna’s multitude of images

the "forefront of the pop—music rat
race. Alek Keshishian’s brilliant
and compelling documentary is
interesting even to those who
don’t like Madonna. It’s an

public eye and is as entertaining
as it is, attimes, outrageous. About
two hours long, Truth ﬂashes by
like a‘ sparkling diamond. It’s a

Madonna. This is Madonna
pushing all the right buttons and

laughing all the way to the bank. - ,.

way Director Ron Howard

approached ﬁre was the highlight ‘

of Bacledrafz‘, his new movie
starring Kurt Russell and William
Baldwin.-

Bacledraﬂis about a ﬁreﬁghting
family. The prologue tells about
the father, a heroic Chicago
fireman who died in a blaze in
1971. Twenty years later, his two
sons, Stephen (Kurt Russell) and
Brian (William Baldwin)
McCaffery, follow in their father’s
footsteps. Stephen is already an
accomplished fireman, while
Brian, who witnessed his father’s
death, tries to prove himself.

You can pretty much guess what
comes next. Brian is assigned to
Ste phen’s ﬁrehouse and some not-
so—brotherly conﬂict ensues. The
plot is predictable and fairly
boring. Rebecca (yeah, those blue
eyes are real) DeMornay is
Stephen’s estranged wife Helen,
who can’t deal with Stephen’s
dangerous job and adds no new
twistto this oft—used character.
Stubborn Stephen obviously

needs to get that stick out of his
butt. The mystery, involving a
creative arsonist-murderer, is
hurried along and has a surprise
ending that cuts right through an
interesting investigation.

Let’s not forget the star. Over
half the movie appears to be shot
in one fire or another. The
photography is stunning, and all
the ﬁre scenes are worth watching.
The ﬁre in the movie actually
appears to have as much character
as most of the people in the movie.
“It’s a living thing. It eats, it
breathes, it hates. And the only
way to kill it is to love it a little,”
says Donald Rimgale, an arson
investigator played by Robert
DeNiro. Howard makes the
viewer believe it.

Two other bright spots in the

film are DeNiro and Donald ,

Sutherland, as arsonist Ronald
Bartel. DeNiro is terriﬁc, giving us
a view of an arson investigator’s
life that has more realism than the
main plot. DeNiro’s character
displays a fascination with ﬁre
which makes him interesting. He
makes you wonder if he would
be an arsonist if he wasn’t an
arson investigator.

, Sutherland plays one such
arsonist who is now in jail; sort of

a Hannibal Lecter with matches.
When Sutherland and DeNiro are
together in this movie, they are
great. Sutl1erland’s third scene
could have been from Silence of
the Lambs and was a huge rip-off,
as bad as‘his earlier scenes were
good. I
Bacledraﬂ had the potential to
be a really good movie. The life of
firefighters was a great untapped
storyline. When there’s a fire, the
movie is good. But when the ﬁre
goes out, Howard feels compelled
to keep up the pace by ramming

drama down the viewers’ throats
with soaring background music
and sweeping camera" shots,
which give the movie an artificial
feel. The scenes with DeNiro,
which are stark and simple, show
what kind of movie it could have
been.

As it is, Backdraﬂ is worth

seeing. The acting is as good as
the dialogue will allow, and again,
the cinematography is excellent.

There aren’t many movies worth V

the current price of a ticket, but
this is a movie that should be seen
on the big screen. This movie isn’t
worth seven dollars, but it is

deﬁnitely worth three at a matinee. ‘.

No one expected it would be
that easy. Particularly, the
Minnesota North Stars, who were
, quickly turned back to December
“  form by now Stanley Cup
Champion Pittsburgh Penguins
'’ -Saturday night, as Pittsburgh
» routed the Stars 8~0 in Game 6 of
 what became the Stanley Cup
 Final.

Beautiful, really, how the
ground birds rose from the lowest
depths of the NHL ice surface in
one long year to the top of the
world which only includes
Canada and the northeastern
United States, as well as certain
 -elite ‘Midwestern states, maybe
, California, possibly the unified,

"Germany, and a host of

_ Scandanavian countries, who may

; '~. not even know the thing is over
'f7'yet. . .

' .' Butitis, and we won!And in the
process, the Penguins (usually a
peaceful -bird) ripped the heart
out of the state of Minnesota_. Their

 Cinderella-story finale wasn't

 Cuppy love...

 Penguins claim Lord St

written by Mother Goose and her
clan, but probably came from
Andrew Dice Clay, or maybe even
Ice Cube.

The headlines told the tale: this
one from the Saint Paul Pioneer
Express —— “Pens Mightier Than
Stars.” Wait, it gets better —
“Lemieux and Company Maul
Minnesota in Cup Clincher” is
how the story went under the
headline. Kinda harsh, but right
on net. Oh!, and a beautiful save
by Barrasso.

So one city is delirious, while
the other is wondering, hoping

’' for another slapshot at glory.

Lets be honest, in all our
happiness and shock and all those
other things that led us to ‘this
state of hyperactivity for the past
80—plus hours, who do you expect
to see back in the Stanley Cup
sooner? Sorry, Minnesota, maybe
you’ll need Lee Majors (as either
the Fall Guy or the Six Million
Dollar Man, maybe both) to go
along with MacGyver (the

daredevil was a guest of Minny’

owner Norm Green Saturday
night) the next time you reach for

the cup.

I actually like Minnesota, but
this is how I show my happiness
— in ranting rips on a worthy

I opponent.

The Penguins went through a
consistent phase in all four of

their playoff series. Losing the first
game in each series set the tone
for the team’s gradual improve-
ment, and by the third
(Washington and Boston) or
fourth game (Minnesota, although
New Jersey proved a bit more
bafﬂing) the Pittsburghers had
leaked the gasoline and lighter
fluid and had the match in hand.

Of course, a vast majority of the
credit goes to the Penguins upper
management and coaching staff,
true arsonists, who showed that
given time, films and the games
themselves, they they could solve
any team that crossed their blue
line.

All that was needed was the
right personnel and Craig Patrick
(along with Bob Johnson, Scotty
Bowman, Rick Kehoe, Barry Smith
and a handful of scouts) studied
and planned and traded until the

mix was deadly.

For example, the Penguins were
able to completely snuff Kirk.

Muller of the Devils, Cam Neely of

Boston, and Brian Bellows of

Minnesota. (The Capitals don’t
have any goal scorers, so they

a'nley’s Cup and Pittsburgh’s heart .

don’t count.) Bellows didn’t score
a single goal against the Pens and
was never even a factor. This from
the man who trailed only three
Penguins (Mario Lemieux, Mark
Recchi and Kevin Stevens) in
playoff scoring before the series.

Lemieux was the difference,
though. He must have read my
analysis a few weeks back that
pleaded that he become the best
player on the ice every night and
want it. Surely [should be thanked

. for the cup insome way. Forget it,

Mario put his game and mind into
a new warp and showed a lot of
people his maturity and will. We
are all thankful and hung over.
But this is one of the greatest

moments in Pittsburgh sports

history and the whole city is
wallowing in the glow of the cup.
some 80,000 lunatics swarmed the
Point yesterday as the Pens

Clifford Rozier and Duke’s Billy

‘ McCaffrey should both wind up

already announcing his plans,

Then, the 6—foot-10-inch
forward visited Kentucky, but
that soured after Wildcat guard

. Sean Woods took Rozier to

Louisville, breaking a recruiting
law about how far a recruit and/
or ‘transfer can be taken for
“entertainment.”

As for Vandy, Rozier’s
apparent choice is baffling, but
he and McCaffrey will sit out a
year of eligibility before
becoming Commodores.

.McCaffrey, who was thought to

be headed to Stanford, indicated
he wanted to play more minutes
at the point guard position to
improve his professional
chances.

fill a role on the right team (say,

UNC’s Pete Chilcutt has been
impressive at postseason

willingness to bang and bruise

, his typical Tar Heel court sense.

Denver mountains would suit
his style well. '

-If, as expected, Pat Riley takes

T the head coaching job with the

New York Knicks, be on the
lookout for big changes.

Kenny Walker, Mark Jackson
and Eddie Lee Wilkens are on
the way out, while sharpshooter
Trent Tucker is being shopped
around in an attempt to land
another first—round draft choice.

Don't bet on it — Tucker is
aging and is limited to three-
pointers; he just isn’t worth a
first—round talent.

Assuming Jackson is run out
of Manhattan, the Knicker-

‘bockers will need a point guard
‘because Maurice Cheeks is

simply too old.

The Knicks select 12th overall
in this year’s draft and could land
a point guard with their mid-O
range pick, but that means the
rookie needs time to develop.

’ Thus, "look for New York to deal

for a ﬂoor leader.

How about Negele Knight,
who lit up the NCAA tournament
in 1990 as Dayton made one of

its patented seven—year

the worst position of the draft,

Syracuse and Stacy Augmon of
Nevada— Las Vegas being
projected stars. N

Seattle and the,Clippers don’t
have much to offer, but they like
Minny’s draft position (because
of the chance at Augmon).

This draft has some good

tr Eleven easy steps for a World Series in Pittsburgh  

 

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, May 29, 1991

 

.3“

‘ii

By Jason Hillman
Senior Sta_ﬂ"Pbotograpber

On Tuesday, May 28, 1991, the
Pirates not only lead the National
League East with a 27-15 record,
but they also have the best record
in baseball. This, my friends, is
the year the Pirates will go all the
way. Yes, this is the year the Pirates
will go to the World Series.

Skeptical? Are you saying, what
makes this team better than the
last three or four Pirate teams?
Could I give you 11 reasons why
the Pirates are going to go to the
Big Show? Well, it just happens
that I can.

1. The team is in first place even
though its Cy Young‘ Award-
winner and National League MVP
are in majorslumps. In fact, many
of the Pirates’ best players last
year haven't done much this year.
Bob Walk has only pitched 17
and two—thirds innings this year
due to an injury, and Jeff King is
currently on the disabled list.
Despite this, the Pirates have the
best record in baseball. Just

imagine what will happen when

these players get back on track.
(And believe me, they will.)

2. The Pirate pitching staff is
arguably the best in the league.
The starting rotation at the end of
the year should be Smith, Smiley,

Drabek, Walk and Tomlin. Smith, .

Smiley and Tomlin have been
pitching superbly, butDrabek and
Walk will come around, both
being accomplished veterans.
Neal Heaton and Vincente
Palacios can and, in the past, have
started. (Palacios is 2-2 with a 2.95
ERA as a starter this year.) The
bullpen, seven pitchers strong, is.
well-balanced with three left-

’ handers and four right-handers.

Bill Landrum is showing the form
he had in 1989, when he had 26
saves, and may become the closer
in the future, but the starting
pitching will carry the Pirates to
the pennant.

3. Despite all the noise about
the disappearance of RJ. Reynolds
and Wally Backman, the bench is
better this year. Lloyd McClendon
can play third, ﬁrst, catcher, and
all of the outfield positions. He is
batting .303 this year and has 3
home runs in 53 at bats. Curtis
Wilkerson can play shortstop and

second base. Mitch Webster is a’

better outfielder than R.J., and

Gary Varsho is better than john
Cangelosi.

4. Orlando Merced has negated
the loss of Sid Bream and has
temporarily satisfied the Pirates’
need for a lead—off hitter. Sid
Bream, in spite of how great a
guy he was, wasn’ta great baseball
player. Consistent, yes. Solid
defensively, yes. But not great.
With Merced batting above .500
and playing better than expected
defensively, first base is as solid
as it was when Bream played
there.

5. The team defense is great.
Van Slyke is one of the best
defensive center fielders in the
game. Barry Bonds, Mike
LaValliere and Jose Lind are well
above average, while Jay Bell and
Bobby Bonilla are solid. Mitch
Webster and Curt Wilkerson are
strong defensively as backups,
which gives Leyland a chance to
rest some of his starters. And
Merced is better defensively than
most people thought. Defense

6. Playoff experience. With a

National League Championship‘

series under their belts, the Pirates
will be more prepared for the
postseason Instead of being awed
by winning the pennant, they will
think of the Reds series last year
and be determined to win it this
year

7. Leyland is a great manager
and Ray Miller is a great pitching
coach. Leyland fully deserved his
manager of the year award last
year and will continue to work his
magic this year, using each player
to the best of their ability. [And
Ray Miller deserves most of the
credit for the Pirates’ outstanding
pitching.

8. Larry Doughty has been
competent in ﬁlling out the ‘roster.
Yes, Doughty made some stupid
moves last year, but he has quietly
added good players to the team.

_McClendon, Wilkerson and

Webster could be a major reason
the Pirates win the pennant this
yeah

9. The principal players are in

the prime of their careers. Van, 
Slyke is /30; Bonilla, 28; Bonds, 27. . "

Gary Redus is the oldest Pirate at

34, and Merced is the youngest at '1. 
24. That is a good combination of 

youth and experience.

. 10. Bobby Bonilla. Right now, 
Bonilla is the cornerstone of the‘ 
team, and it looks like he will 9'
have a great yearithis year. With“ 
free agency ahead of him, he has »

a lot of incentive, and he is a

winner at heart. He will be the V R 

workhorse, the star that leads the
Pirates to the World Series.

11. I want to go to, the. World 

Series. OK, I’m only 21 and will

probably have another chance to A

see one. But, sayl move to Denver
——who knows when they’ll geta
major league baseball team? And

if they do, I’ll be 60 before they ,- 

get anywhere near the Series.
Besides, ‘I really like this Pirate
team. They are exciting to watch
and fun to root for. And they are
good enough that when October

rolls around, I’ll have some World , ' I

Series tickets in my hand.
