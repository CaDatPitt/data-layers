U.S. lacks war support outside of Europe

By Jenna Ferrara
Copy Editor

U.S. involvement in the Persian,Gulf is mobilizing the
Arab world behind Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
said two Pitt professors at yesterday’s teach-in.

Political science Professor Richard Cottam and Spanish
Professorjohn Beverly opened the teach—in on the war
in the gulf with a discussion of background issues.

Americans are wrong to think the entire world
supports them, according to Cottam. “If you move
outside of Europe into the streets of Moslem cities
anywhere  they’re all against us,” he said. “lThe Iraqis]
know how brutal [Saddam] is and have chosen to
follow him anyway  The greater evil they see is [the

United Statesl.”

According to Beverly, the war in the gulf is an unjust
war. “I’m not a pacifist. I think there are wars which
should be supported,” Beverly said. “But the gulf war
is not a just war, ethically or morally.”

World opinion is against the United States partly
because it overthrows popularly elected governments,
said Beverly. “Brutal military dictatorships [followed],
which tortured and killed many of their fellow citizens
without too much concern from Washington, [D.C.].”

The United States has created many of the oppressive
regimes it tries to topple, said Beverly. “Sometimes, like
Saddam and [Manuel] Noriega, these tyrants are creatures
of U.S. policy itself.”

Some people do not want things to return to normal in the

Anderson said. ‘

Cottam. “And who’s going to defend Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait from the wrath of these people?” he said.
According to Cottam, the United States interferes with
Arab self-determination. “When we impose [a leader]
on’ another people, that regime will be de-legitimized

and despised,” said Cottam. Almost a quarter of the 40 -

million people of Iran demonstrated against the U.S.—

Israel shares the blame for the war in the gulf, said

Beverly. “If [Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak] Shamir had

been willing to [consider] a peace proposal and make ‘

concessions to the Palestinians,” perhaps the war could
have been averted, he said.

Desert Storm ten years in making

1981 was the year that led up
to the gulf war, according to
Christopher Hitchens, columnist

Anderson said the media is “deliberately trying to play
down the opposition.” Anderson said there are two wars in
progress: the war in the Middle East and “the psychological
war" that is being waged against the American public by the

Young said it is especially important for younger people to

they offered them weapons for

Yeager says amt/ersz'z‘y may oﬂer compromise on police reports

By Stacey Jakubowski
stag Writer

The university possibly will allow public
access to police reports, as long as the
names and information under investigation
are deleted, said John Yeager, vice
president for administration. V

Yeager, who announced on Feb. 6 that
police incident reports would no longer
be available to the public, said this option
could be offered as an alternative to the
short police summaries that are now being
released.

Yeager said starting this alternative
police-report policy is only a phone call
away.

“I have no problem releasing information
this way. The only reason I like the
summaries better is because I thought it

gave a better, more professional
presentation, as opposed to blotted—out
police reports,” he said.

There may have to be‘ other minor
deletions on these reports, according to
Yeager. For example, the campus police
will probably delete items relevant to an
active investigation, but Yeager said the
information would be omitted with
professionalism.

The campus police implemented the
new policy of not disclosing incident
reports to the public after the policy was
reviewed. .

Yeager said the policy change was based
on the media and the policy of having the
fullest amount of disclosure while at the
same time protecting confidentiality of
students.

He said that over the last several months

the campus police has been receiving
external requests for access to public-
safety ﬁles. The former practice of the
campus police has been to deny these
outside requests.

“Legal general council told me that there
is no legal obligation to provide this
information, and that was the original
basis for saying the police—su mmary policy
was reasonable to implement,” said Yeager.

He added that during the review, it was
decided that the campus police did not
have a very consistent policy because The
Pitt News, a media organization, was
getting access to this information. The
university’s legal general council examined
the legal background of the situation and
said a reasonable alternative would be to
provide summaries of the incident reports.

“Our intent is to provide the fullest

disclosure of information that is possible,
while at the same time protecting the

privacy and conﬁdentiality for our students, I

faculty and staff," said Yeager.

Yeager said the problem with the revised
policy may have been from “my
miscommunications to my people” as to
what information could be used in the
summary reports. '

“I think they thought that a brief statement

‘would be fine, and that’s what they-

provided," Yeager said. “I spoke with the
campus police about the brief statements,
and they have ‘supposedly made them
longer. I have not seen the summaries, but
I assume they are better."

The police summaries now should
include the time and place of incident and
the number of people involved in the
incident, Yeager said.

Pitt student organization officers
and members can improve their
personal and group leadership
skills at the Student Government
Board’s 16th Annual Leadership
Conference on Saturday, Feb. 23.

Following a continental

Pitt Union from 9:30 to 10:00
a.m., the conference, which was
organized by the SGB student-
relations committee, will be

divided into three hour-long
sessions with 10-minute breaks
between each.

The first session will include
workshops on group motivation,
planning and goal setting and
inter-organizational cooperation.
The workshops for the second

session are leadership
responsibilities, recruitment and
communication from the

leadership perspective.
Publicity and promotions,
policies and facilities and
conducting the effective meeting
will make up the final session.

The workshops will be
conducted by university staff,
student facilitators and members
of the Emerging Leader Program.

“We expect [the conference] to
work out well,” said Daryl
Grecich, graduate student
assistant in the Office of Student
Activities. “Last year’s went well,
so we’re basically following the
same format. Most of the sessions
are being repeated from last year
because they were so popular.”

StAR coffeehouse to address racial problems

By Lane Hornfeck
stag Writer

Racial problems on campus will
be the focus of a coffeehouse on
Friday.

Students Against Racism is
sponsoring the coffeehouse in
the Schenley Cafe at 8:30 p.m. on
Friday, Feb. 22.

According to Matt Sipple, the
vice president of StAR, “It is [an
activity with] an open
microphone. Everyone drinks
coffee, sings songs, reads poetry,
and we make a few
announcements.”

Sipple said he hopes the

coffeehouse will make the
campus aware of what StAR is
trying to accomplish.

“Basically, it is something that
a lot of groups are doing to make
everyone aware of what they are
doing,” said Sipple.

Sipple said there is a lack of
communication among all
students at Pitt, especially among
students of different races.

“I believe racism is when one
person believes himself to be
inherently superior,” said Sipple.
“Plus, they have the economic
backing to ensure that [certain]
people do not benefit from the
wealth of society.”

“There is no such thing as

difference between the reaction
to what has been done to your
people as opposed to denying an
entire culture of something simply
because of their race.

“Whites hate blacks, and blacks
hate whites, but is it the same
kind of hate? Whites hate blacks
because they feel they are
superior, and blacks hate whites
because they have been subjected

to this feeling of superiority,”

said Sipple.

StAR hopes to improve the
relations of all students on campus
because racial relations at Pitt are

poor, said Sipple.

According to Sipple, “In terms
of campuses across the country,
Pitt does not have many violent
incidents. However, the racial
climate is very poor. For example,
there is a two—thirds dropout rate

[among] the African-American.

students. Also, there is a definite
lack of minority faculty.”

Sipple said he does not believe
the problem lies solely in any

type of “forced segregation.”

“In the Schenley Cafe, you’ll

here and a white group here and
a Greek one there. There is a lot
of voluntary separation,” he said.

Brutus says number of blacks in combat too high

 

0

By Renee Crespy
Staﬁ" Writer

Professor Dennis Brutus spoke at the
teach-in yesterday about racism in the
Persian. Gulf war.

Brutus brought up five points about
blacks ﬁghting in the gulf.

-The number of blacks serving in the
military is disproportionately high.

-The reasons for this high number.

-Understanding why blacks enter the
military at this rate.

0 Lessons that should have been learned
about the high percentage of blacks who
fought in Vietnam.

-The way the media has manipulated
images about warfare.

. “Blacks currently make up 24 percent of

those that are in the desert. Blacks make
up 12 percent of the population, but 24
percent are in the military,” said Brutus.

Black men aren’t alone in the war,
according to Brutus. The number of black
women participating in Operation Desert
Storm is also high, he said.

“Black women make up 48“percent of
the women in the war today,”said Brutus.

Brutus said he is worried about the
black casualties in the gulf war, as
compared to the high number of black
casualties in Vietnam.

“Twenty-four percent of the military
was made up of blacks in Vietnam, and 51
percent came home in body bags,” said
Brutus.

He said blacks will die because only a
ﬁfth-grade reading level is necessary to

join the infantry. Also, many young blacks
who have not been able to get a strong
education join the military because they
see no other opportunities.

“Those who can’t afford universities
could choose to standon the corner and
hang out or sell dope, and there are more

‘ young blacks between the ages of 20 and

25 in prison than in college. But those who
wanted to make something of themselves
choose the military,” said Brutus. “Some
feel that it is a last resort.”

Brutus said the media persuades people
to join the military and sends out subtle
hints to the public.

“Not only has the media collaborated in
their process to persuade people to join
the military, but they have added a subtle
ingredient, and that ingredient is that if

you don’t support the war, that you support
Saddam lHusseinl,” said Brutus.

“It's like you can’t say, ‘I support my
country, but I think we made a wrong
decision,” said Brutus. “I believe the best
way to support the troops is to bring them
home and bring them home alive.”

Brutus said the human casualties of war
have been ignored, and that many people,
blacks and whites, will die because of the
“Nintendo Syndrome,” where people don’t
fully comprehend the notions of death
and destruction.

“War has been dehumanized. People
can dismiss the notion of dead people by
saying, ‘Did we have a hit?’ or ‘We didn’t
have a hit,’ just like you were playing a
video game,” said Brutus. “It desensitizes
people."

Television cannot be

only source of news
ByMilt Klopfer I

Senior Staff Writer

_ Fred Gustafson urged all those interested in learning
the truth about the war to turn off their televisions and
pick up a good news magazine.

Gustafson said that getting war information solely from
the television can be misleading, and magazines such as
The Nation or The National Catholic Reporter are good
alternate sources of information.

“What [most people who are relying solely on Cable
News Network] are seeing is pretty much a demonization
of the Iraqis and the lighting of a highly technological
war,” he said. “What you don’t see are the bodies.
Casualties in this war have been misreported or
unreported.”

He cited a recent episode of The McNeil-Lehrer Report
as an example of television's distorting power. Gustafson
said the panel which discussed last week's bombing of an
Iraqi air-raid shelter was the most biased panel of right;
wingers that could be found.

“lOne of the panelists] said that the casualties were
civilian employees,” he said. “You could look [at the
pictures] and see that [some oil the bodies were children,
but neither McNeil nor Lehrer challenged him.”

According to Gustafson, media coverage of the war is
distorted because the corporations controlling news
outlets are involved in interlocking directorships with oil
companies and major defense contractors.

“lThese corporations] have worldwide inﬂuences and
power,” said Gustafson. “They can topple governments.
When they have influence in the media, they can mislead
you in terms of why things are being done and how.”

Chatham College Professor Chris Michelmore
explained Middle East boundary lines and brieﬂy
outlined some Palestinian history during the teach-in
yesterday. A i

“Railways began to divide the country. Britain did
not want the Germans ‘to control the [Persian] Gulf
area, so Kuwait was sort of carved out," Michelmore
said. “The borders in the Middle East don’t represent
anything too permanent. The map was drawn on a

- wrinkled piece of paper. No one really knows where
the boundaries lie. Its like going from ~Ohio\ to
Pennsylvania; there is no firm line,” she continued.

Michelmore led the “Historical Issue in the War”
workshop. '

“The struggle [between Iraq and Kuwait] is of two
related people over one small piece of land. The last

History of Mia’-East conflicts examined  

its religion is strong, and it has enough oil to pay for

piece of this puzzle is that the Palestine issue will be
settled,” Michelmore said. ,
Although Saudi Arabia is not a strong military power,

its defense, according to Michelmore. Border disputes
are all caused by oil, Michelmore said. In the past,Iraq
has accused Kuwait of slant drilling while Iraq was a
fighting Iran.

Michelmore explained the difference between an
Arab—Israeli conflict and an inter-Arab conﬂict. The
first is over the existence of Israel or its borders; the
second is over who will rule the Arab world.

“We don’t necessarily want to see a uniﬁed Arab
nation. The state structures are too different and varied
to allow that," Michelmore said. “The Soviet Union is
worried that we’ll strike on our own. Their peacemaking
is their attempt to make sure that they are in the peace
treaty. They will continue to be an active player, even
though they have negative cards." I '

“I think what we’re looking at here
is a massive military presence in the
Middle East for the rest of our
lifetimes,” said Beverly.

Beverly said he disagrees with Pitt
President Wesley Posvar’s refusal to
take a stand against the war. “The
university is more often than not
complicit in war and aggression,” he
said.

Trudy Palmer, assistant professor
of English and a member of Faculty

for Peace, said she wanted more
support from the university for the
teach-in. “We would have liked to
have a moratorium [on classes]  To
remain silent [and not speak against
the war] is an endorsement of the
status quo,” said Palmer.

Pro-war speakers were not included
in the teach-in. “We decided not to 
present a perfectly balanced picture
because we felt the other perspeétive
is getting an enormous amount of
[press coverage] without our help,”

said Palmer.

'/ Palmer said events such as the '

teach-in aren’t necessarily expected

, to end the war. “I don’t think that

George Bush is going to say that, ‘Oh,
Pitt held a teach-in. Let’s end the war.’
I mean, who are we kidding?" she
said. “But  I think we have to look
at efforts now as  long-range
investments beyond this war —— so
that we are cultivating a generation
that  will not stand for this kind of
action again.”

Hate

Continued from page 3

Anti-American feelings in Europe and Third World countries
have been prevalent for decades, said Rovelli, who is from
Verona, Italy.

“Everyone in Europe knows what American bombardment is.
Six thousand people were killed in one night in Dresden.
Fifteen thousand people were killed in Berlin. Nagasaki and
Hiroshima represent the way America is perceived by the rest
of the world,” Rovelli said.

Standing up against the West makes [Iraqi President] Saddam
Hussein a hero to some Arabs. “In Pakistan and Algeria,
Hussein’s picture is in coffee shops everywhere,” said Rovelli.

Rovelli said the U.S. media have distorted Americans’
perceptions of the war. “Americans are unaware that huge
crowds gathered in Morocco to chant [for] the death of President
Bush. Huge crowds marched in favor of Iraq but got no media
coverage in the U.S.,” he said.

About 40 students attended the workshop.

In closing, Rovelli asked, “Do you want America to become
number one at the price of soldiers’ lives? Are you willing to kill
to help America become a superpower?”

Sta_[)“W1'iter

Jimmy Krenn sauntered down
the quiet hall of the William Pitt
Union towards the Pitt Program
Council office, toting a Bart
Simpson notebook. His black,
ankle—length Los Angeles Raiders
stadium jacket made swishing
noises when he sat down in the
swivel chair. _

“No, really, I got this thing on
sale,” said the 31-year-old
Pittsburgher in response to a

* joke abouthisjacket. “I wearit as M

a conversation piece.”

Krenn said he thinks of himself
primarily as a comedian, but he
is also half of a two—man show
on WDVE-FM with fellow disc
jockey Scott Paulsen.

Krenn performed last night in
the WPU Assembly Room after
comedian Foley Z. Krenn does

a comedy because he “likes to see

people laugh.” The money is
fine too, Krenn said.

“I graduated from [Indiana
University of Pennsylvania] in
1983 with a bachelor's of science
in business and did stand—up
there in comedy clubs,” he said.

He started to make a living 5

with comedy in January 1984.
His success at comedy clubs gave
him the chance to do his own
routine, and he has been doing
just that ever since. He frequently
does his act at the Funny Bone
downtown, he said.

Krenn grew up on the North
Side, near the Strip District, close
to where Metropol is today. A
friend of his, Dennis Miller of
“Saturday Night Live,” is one of
the many people trying to get
Krenn to move his act to Los

Angeles, the city where comics
have the chance to make it big.

“Pittsburgh is my favorite city.
I don’t want to leave the ‘burg,”
he said. His friends and family
are here.

“Within the next year or so, I’ll
feel comfortable enough with my
act  thatl could break into some
national stand-up [comedy]
shows."

has earned him the title of
Pittsburgh’s comedy “king” and a
groupie following fondly dubbed
the “Krennheads.”

“They’re mostly friends and
fans who keep coming back.
They’re nice people,” Krenn said.

“The craziest thing I ever did
was, Paulsen and I went to New
York for the “Hate the Mets”
broadcast,” he said. “We got about
20 death threats the moment Scott

Boonts

 

and I walked into the stadium.
They told us that we wouldn’t get

threats every day. We could

Krenn bounded onto the stage
in the assembly room to the

Traveling Witkowskis’ version of
the Dr. Who hit “Rocking the
TARDIS.” He jumped up and
down, throwing his arms in the
air to the beat of the music as the
raucous applause of the crowd
almost drowned out his voice.
His eyes darted around the
audience for a second, and he
paused, laughing.

Hitchens

Continued from page I
Hitchens’ audience asked why
the United States was in the war.
Hitchens spoke about the
AWACS controversy, in which
many of these military aircraft
were sold to Saudi Arabia, and

the U.S. tendency to rule by proxy.

“[Secretary of Statejamesl Baker
is always one for considering the
Arab proxy, and rule by proxy is
unstable and unreliable,” said
Hitchens. “The United States
needed a new superpower:

“Everything made from scratch
the old-fashioned way.”

proxy. ”
Hitchens said the victims of the
gulf war were predetermined.

“This is a war that has already
disclosed its victims,” said
Hitchens. “The only question
people are asking is, ‘Do we
have to pay for this with blood,
and if so, whose blood will it
be?’"

“The U.S. position in the world
is not an immediate issue, but
rather [the issue] is longevity,”
said Hitchens. “Bush says troops
will come home soon, but I have
no conception of that. I just don’t
know when that will be.”

to Johnson, people who believe that everyone should stand
behind our government and its policy in the Middle East are
asking Americans to forfeit their rights as members _of a
democratic society.

Molly Rush of the Thomas Merton Center questioned the
U.S. media’s casualty reports. “One thousand deaths to me
seems unbelievable,” Rush said.

She said Operation Desert Storm was the most censored war
in the history of the United States and said “the Pentagon
totally controls everything.”

All the speakers said the the next generation needs to
support the peace movement. Rush said she and her
colleagues were running out of energy and were hoping that
younger people would step in to relieve them.

discussed how this peace
movement differs from the one
during the Vietnam War.

“People today are trying to
distinguish between being against
the war and being against the
soldiers," said Young. “People
think now that the protesters of
Vietnam were wrong ‘Iby not
supporting the troops]. Now you
see bumper stickers that say
‘Support the troops; bring them
home.”

Philosophy Professor Tamara
Horowitz, the other discussion
leader, pointed out another side
to the war. “It’s like the U.S. is

them. You’re so drunk at the end
of the concert you’re gonna light

' someone on fire in front of you,”
_ he said, stopping to laugh at his

own joke.

The audience loved it. Krenn
would wrap people up in their
laughter and then suddenly stop
speaking. And then people
would laugh harder.

. “I am sooo sorry, man,” Krenn
said, imitating Sean Penn.

“The dude in front of us looks
like a big blue ﬂame.” The
crowd screamed. ,

Krenn’s repertoire is mostly
characters, he said. His favorite
is a guy named Stanley, the station
manager. His performance
centered around his experiences
in college. '

“The guy next to you,” he said
first in his normal voice and then
switching back to Penn, “is

drunker than you are and says, I

‘Wow, special effects. These guys
are wilder than Floyd, man.”’

you back a hundred years’ to
Third World countries. It's easy
to do this with minimal cost to
ourselves. Bombing other
countries as a tool of foreign
policy can be construed as a sort
of moral blackmail. It's wrong to
make Iraq an example.”

The gulf war was also compared
to World War 11 because it was
one of the most popularly
supported wars of all time. For
many people, WWII was a very
positive experience, Young said.
The belief that we had a right to
be involved helped rationalize
for many the loss of life as a
necessity to destroy such an evil
presence as Hitler, according to

Young.

Young said Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein has been
portrayed as.“a new Hitler” who
is so evil and despicable that he
needs to be fought against at any
cost. This gives a new generation
of Americans many of the same
feelings that their grandparents
had some 45 years ago, according
to Young.

Sophomore Mary Rendulic,
who had skipped two classes to
attend the discussion, believedit
was worthwhile.

“I got a lot of insight on people
against the war — the ‘hippie’
ideal of paciﬁsts. But it’s changed.
I still support the war,” she said.

war,” added Castek.

Students for Peace suggested several ways for students to be
involved in the peace movement. Students can write a letter
to their congressional representative. They can drop off a
leaﬂet in their representatives office. Students can participate
in marches and rallies.

They can stage a protest in the bookstore demanding that
pro-war items such as T-shirts be removed because this is the
university’s subtle way of taking a “position on the war,
according to Castek. D

Students can also demand that an equal number of pro-
peace items be placed in the bookstore. The group strongly
discourages violence. I

“Violence only breeds more violence," said Castek.

    pg Compromtsmg goals?

The University of Pittsburgh has claimed that by
withholding campus-police records, the university was
merely -trying to protect students from possible
embarrassment because of names associated with crimes

‘ on campus. Now that stance, even though it may not have

changed, has opened up a question. .
Yesterday, Vice President of Adrninistrationjohn Yeager,

, who originally said that the university would no longer
, give access of campus-police reports to the public,

offered a sort of compromise that would give all information
on the reports, except the names, to thepublic.

The university claimed that by doing this, everybody
would be happy. Unfortunately, that is not the case.

The release of these documents is a right protected by
the First Amendment. This means that the entire report,
with names, places and dates, is free for the public to see.
Any restriction of any part of those reports is a direct
violation of the First Amendment and the 1965 Pennsylvania
Open ‘Records Act. ' , .

The Pitt News believes that by withholding this
information, the university is restricting the rights of not
only the media but of the general public as well. Because
of this, we will not quit fighting to get access to these
reports. _ ' .

Ever since Yeager officially established the university’s

‘ stance on the police reports, he has slowly but surely

given us more and more information about the crimes.
Yeager believes that this still keeps the confidentiality of

the victim or suspect in check.

ButYeager’s fears, as we have said before, are. unfounded.

It has always been the policy of The Pitt News not to print

names in the campus police blotter.

Although many people see this as a sign of compromise,
we see it as something more disturbing: a lack of support
for that position. For if the university is so willing to
compromise on such an important topic, this could mean
that it is willing to compromise its intended goal — that
is to say, the confidentiality of the victims and/ or suspects.

John Yeager has consistently maintained that the
university will not allow the publication of students’
names. But by taking compromises further and further,
The Pitt News wonders if the university really cares more
about protecting the potential victim or protecting itself
from liability suits.

Sit down and llJI'it,BEl

Oh sure, blame it on the mob

The current goings—on in the
Soviet Union read like a bad
supermarket paperback. Mikhail
Gorbachev, the cherubic
president, once had it all —
power, prestige, and the adoration
of every living organism on the
planet (or so it seemed).

Then his empire collapsed -
the Baltics decided that the Soviet
Bear wasn’t very good company
after all, and the economy slowly
deteriorated. Now his cabinet
members are resigning left and
right.

Then, just as things were about
to hit rock bottom for Times 1989
Man of the Year and the 1990
Nobel Peace Prize winner, he
found a way out —— sort of. Last
Thursday, The Pittsburgh Press
reported that Soviet organized
crime was the source of some of
his economic woes.

The scary part about this: He’s
not kidding. Gorbachev said last
week that Soviet organized-crime
figures, in order to gain political
power, are attempting to pay off
the newspapers. This is an
impressive feat in itself,

considering that in the days before .

glasnost, only the government
was allowed to do this.

I don't know about you, but it
sounds to me like Gorbachev is
pretty desperate to start blaming
his troubles on organized crime.

.That’s a tactic typically used by

G—men and mayors of New York
City. National leaders tend to
blame everything on the press,
not the people who supposedly
control it.

I also have to wonder what
Gorbachev means by “organized
crime” in the Soviet Union.

Adam
Richter

Typically I like to adopt the
“Godfather” stereotype, but in
non-Western lands I never know
what to expect. After all, in the
Soviet Union, the “mafia” could
be everything from the street
urchins that sell illegal blue jeans
in Red Square to guys in outdated
suits and fedoras who are tossing
bodies into. the Volga River. Of
course, the latter group could
easily be confused with the KGB.

Now it’s anybody’s guess
whether or not Gorbachev’s
paranoia is justified. If it is, then
perhaps the great Soviet leader
should temporarily take up
residence in the Miami Hilton
until his country’s problems blow
over. If not, then I would
recommend something more
along the lines of Bellevue.

Actually, the economic, and
political crises in the Soviet Union
may be just the thing for the
Henry Kissingers and Zbigniew
Brzezinskis of the world. Think
about it — the collapse of
Gorbachev’s regime would mean
a return to the “old world order,”
which, I assume, was replaced
by Bush’s “new world order.” It
only makes sense, even though
no one has quite figured out
what his “new world order"
actually is.

As far as I can guess, the “old
world order” refers to a time
when our only enemy was the
apparently now-defunct
Communist bloc, and the
executive branch handled our

containment policy. Meanwhile,
our policy toward Third World
nations was handled by the likes
of the United Fruit Company. It
was a nice, neat, orderly system.

Then came the NEW WORLD
ORDER, which arrived after most
East Europeans discovered that,
for them at least, communism
was -just too much of a joke to
take seriously anymore. So they
turned in their deutsche marks
(or whatever) for dollars as their
national leaders either stepped
or fell by the wayside. ,

At the same time, we decided
that United Fruit, et al. was no

longer quite ﬁt to run Third World '

foreign policy, so we handed the
job over to the likes of John
Poindexter for a while. So now
we’ve ignored the Soviets and
focused our attention on deciding
which picayune leaders we liked
and didn’t like.

Looking at it, I think I’d prefer
the “old world order.” Call me a
sentimentalist, but nothing
Saddam Hussein says will ever
top Khrushchev’s “We will bury
you.” When it comes to
meaningless threats, no one can
top a Soviet presiderrt.

Well, who knows where
Mikhail Gorbachev’s underworld
delusions will lead us? It just may
be the nostalgic escape (OK, I’m
stretching this) that old stalwart
Republicans need. Whether his
claims are real or not, I doubt
things in the Soviet Union will
stay the same for long.

Perhaps Gorbachev had better
look into a Miami co-op.

While I oppose the university’s
action in forbidding you access to
campus-police records, I also
oppose the way you have
primarily excerpted “humorous”
reports from the campus police
blotter. There are real problems
with crime in Oakland and at Pitt.

Letters

You need to hire a serious crime
reporter to combine the more
serious crimes reported in the
campus police blotter with those

reported to the Pittsburgh police
(Squirrel Hill station). Then you
will be performing a real service

Road kill

Panthers finally prail in Capia Centre

By Scott Campbell
Assistant Sports Editor

LANDOVER, Md. ——- It took the Panthers
four months to produce their best game of
the season, a 94-85 victory over St. John’s
last Saturday.

But it took the team only four days to
top that effort. The Panthers beat the
Georgetown Hoyas 78-65 last night.

Sean Miller’s 17 second-half points keyed
the Panthers, who led from wire to wire.
The win improved Pitt to 19-8, 8-5 in the
Big East Conference. Georgetown fell to

15-9 (7-6). The win moves Pitt ahead of
the Hoyas into sole possession of second
place in the Big East and pulls the Panthers
within one game of the Syracuse ‘(9-4)
Orangemen. Syracuse lost to St. John’s 77-
72 last night. Pitt will shoot for its second
straight road win this Sunday at the Carrier
Dome. S A

“To win two in a row on the road,” said
Miller, “hasn’t happened since, like, I
don’t know when.”

It’s hard to blame Miller for not knowing.
The team hasn’t won two consecutive
road conference games since 1988-89,
when it defeated Boston College and
Seton Hall.

“This gives the team the different light
for the rest of the season. This gives us a
lot of conﬁdence for Sunday’s game,"

H In theseries’ last eight games at the
Capital Centre, Georgetown won by an
average of 18 points with a 62-57 game in
1987-88 the only close contest. “We haven't
had a lot of success. down here; in fact
we’ve had a lot of embarrassment,” said

. really” well.

Pitt Coach Paul Evans.

Despite the Hoyas’ recent shooting
struggles (56 out of 89 in losses at Seton
Hall and Connecticut), a Panther victory
last night seemed unlikely;

The Pitt victory also breaks several
negative streaks in the process: -

-They hadn’t won a road game in a
month. ‘

-The Panthers have never won at the
Cap Centre.

0 Georgetown had not lost three games
in a row since 1987-88.

It didn’t take Jeanne Dixon to predict a

defeat for the Panthers, but the team’s
fourth consecutive road loss was not to
be. The closest Georgetown could come
to Pitt was 65-57 with 2 minutes and 50
seconds remaining, but Pitt hit 17 of 18
free throws down the stretch and secured
the win.

Early on, it looked as if “Hoya Paranoia”
had taken on a new meaning, as the
Georgetown players seemed afraid to
shoot the ball.

_men Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo

Mourning have come under fire for not
shooting ‘enough. The two took a
combined 21 shots in the two losses, and
the 12,297 at the Cap Centre were letting
them know about it.

Mourning even got the old “air bal1”
chant from the home crowd after a first-
half brick.

Mutombo and Mourning combined for
35 points, but 23 came in the second half
after Pitt was comfortably ahead. 5

One look at Pitt’s list of all-time top scores in gymnastics
will attest to Tina Taylor's dominance on ﬂoor exercise.

She set a new record on ﬂoor on Saturday at Trees Hall,
with a score of 9.80. She eclipsed her old mark of 9.70 and
now holds the top 5 scores in Pitt history, as well as eight
of the top 10.

Pitt Coach Debbie Yohman realized almost immediately .

that Saturday’s performance was special. “I wouldn't
have predicted anything, but I knew it [the score] was
going to be high. Youcould just tell by the judges’ faces,
and they really didn’t have much to write down,” she
said.

Yohman described Taylor as “a VBFY dYn3miC
performer,” and said that her dance, choreography and
expression contribute a great deal to her performance.
She added that Taylor has made tremendous strides as an
all-around gymnast since coming to Pitt.

Taylor credits her older sister, Tammy, with sparking
her interest in gymnastics and giving her the opportunity
to take lessons. But the first obstacle of her career was her

mother.

“At first, my mom didn’t'want me to be in [gymnastics];
she just thought that it was too dangerous,” she said. “She
didn’t even pay for the lessons —— my sister paid for
them.”

Taylor quickly won her mother’s approval by displaying
her incredible talents. At age 9, TaY10f COmpeted in a
West Virginia state competition and ﬁnally convinced her
mother that gymnastics was the best thing for her
daughter.

“My parents have been really great. They didn’t push
me too much, but they have helped me out a lot,” Taylor
said.

Following her freshman year of high school, Taylor
moved away from home to dedicate herlife to gymnastics.
She transferred to Peters Township High School and
trained fervently with the goal of advancing to the U.S.
Olympic trials. According to Taylor, thiswas a major step

Miller, McNeal
head charge

By Bob Maselli
Stajf Writer

LANDOVER, Md. —- There may
be a lot of reasons why the Pitt
Panthers ended their eight—game
losing streak against the Georgetown
Hoyas at the Capital Centre.

One reason may be the way the
Panthers held Dikembe Mutumbo
and Alonzo Mourning to just five
and seven first-half points,
respectively.

Another reason may be the 28 out
of 33 free throws made by the
Panthers, something that Pitt head
coach Paul Evans described as
“something you’re supposed to do.”

But the main reasons were the
play of Sean Miller and Chris McNeal.

Miller played superior basketball,
scoring 20 points, 17 in the second
half while netting three three-
pointers in a row.

Georgetown Coach John
Thompson described Miller’s three
consecutive three-pointers as
“severely damaging psychologically”
to the Hoyas. _

“We tried to get him to do that,”
said Evans. “People don’t expect
him, except for the past three games,
to get the three—pointer. But when
we do that, it spreads. the defense

“T onightagain he made acouplej
of pull-up jumpers, and that’s
something he hasn’t been able to do
really well. He’s playing with as

much confidence as ever,” Evans v

added.

McNeal played exceptional
defense against the Hoyas. He
caused Georgetown to have
numerous turnovers while he was
in the game.

It seemed as though when McNeal
was on the court, Georgetown’s big

men did not score — a direct turn- ~

around from the way he played
against the Hoyas at the Civic Arena
on Jan. 27.

“We have been very happy with
him,” said Evans. “Tonight helped
his confidence.”

Lady Panthers win last home game over Boston College\‘

By Ryan Buncher
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Three seniors in the ﬁnal home
games of their careers led the Pitt
women’s basketball team to a 85-
70 win over Boston College last
night.

Forward Lorri Johnson,
returning from a one-game
absence because of a knee
problem, was tops on the team in
scoring with 21 points and
rebounding with 12. Her biggest
contribution was hitting some
key shots early in the second half
when a 38-30 Pitt lead at halftime

melted away to a two—point
advantage.

Center Connie Hurt came off
the bench to score 16 points,
grab 6 rebounds and block four
shots. Whitney Mack scored only
eight, but she played an excellent
defensive game and gave the
team solid minutes at shooting
guard when Lisa Fessler struggled.
Fessler hit only two of eight shots
on the night.

The win raised the Lady
Panthers’ record to 14-11 overall
and 9-5 in the Big East.

The Lady Panthers continue to
get solid play out of three

freshman starters. Erin Maloy
scored 1 3 points, including hitting
all three of the three—point field
goals she attempted. Jenine Joyce
contributed 11 points and eight
rebounds. One player who did
struggle was Janna Huemrich.
She had eight points and seven
boards but struggled all night
defensively and was visibly
frustrated.

“Janna is her own worst
enemy,” said Coach Kirk Bruce.
“She wants to do everything right.
When it doesn’t happen that way,
she gets down on herself.”

led all scorers on the BC team
with 26 points and all rebounders
with 13. Senior center Carla
Wenger had 16 points and 11
rebounds before fouling out late
in the second half.

After Johnson returned,
sophomore point guard Maureen
McConnell was back out of the
lineup. She had returned from a
foot injury to play in last Saturday’s
game against Seton Hall. Bruce
said she was held out of the
game to make sure she would be
ready for the Big East
Tournament. Starting forwardJil1
McElhinny also missed the game

due to a leg injury.

Bruce said, “We don’t need to
win the Big East to get in the
[NCAA tournament], but we need
to win the rest of our games. If
we win all the rest of them and
lose the championship game in
the Big East , we've got a good
shot at getting in. We would be
18-12, having beaten two ranked
teams (UConn twice), and we
are coming on here at the end.
That’s crucial for the pollsters.”

The two remaining games are
this Saturday at St. John’s and
Monday at 14th-ranked
Connecticut.

Taylor

Continued from page 9
for hercareer.

Her goal of reaching the
Olympic trials was dealt a
crushing blow when she suffered
a severe knee injury near the end
of her junior year. The knee
required major reconstructive
surgery, and extensive
rehabilitation followed.

' “After I blew out my knee, I
didn’t even think about the
Olympics,” she said. Instead, she
focused her attention upon
earning a college scholarship.

Despite the severity of the
injury, Taylor never doubted her
ability to bounce back. Her doctor
expected the recovery to take a
full year, but Taylor returned to
her old farm in only six months.
Her collegiate career began at

Ohio State, but she transferred to
Pitt after her freshman season,
looking for a complete
educational experience that
provided more than just
gymnastics.

“At Ohio State they put their
athletes up on a pedestal. It was
just too much pressure,” she said.

Yohman knew that Taylor
wouldbe capable of contributing
to Pitt’s program very early.
Almost immediately Taylor
established herself as a factor on
ﬂoor exercise. Since that time,
becoming the gymnast she is
now has been a gradual process
for her.

“Finally, this year, her senior
year, she has jelled and reached
her potential as an all-around
lgymnastl,” Yohman said.

, Henry Rollin spoken ord

«Qt

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

Those of you who were
disenchanted with Henry Rollins’
absence from his last scheduled
Spoken Word performance will
be happy to hear that he’ll be
back in town. Hopefully there
won’t be another divine
intervention or natural disaster to
impede his arrival.

Spoken Word virtuoso,
ex—Black Flag vocalist, singer and
founder of the Rollins Band and
Wartime —— these are just a few of
the projects Henry ﬁlls his ever-
busy life with. He averages two
books, two albums and 1 50 shows
through 16 countries in a year.
He lives for the moment, and the
more he can experience, the
better.

As a motivating factor behind
Black Flag’s success, Henry was
the epitome of the badass punk
rocker. He was out to burn shit
down, blow shit up and destroy
whatever got in his way.

The Spoken Word concept
grew out of the numerous
memoirs that Henry had collected
over the years on the road with
Black Flag. It burgeoned into a
powerful Rollins live performance
without the music.

Other musical performers
followed suit. Jello Biafra (Dead
Ke nnedys, Lard) and Lydia Lunch
are two orators who often appear

. on the same bill with Henry and

who have come to find that the
word really is more powerful
than the fist.

The first inkling of Henry’s
literary angst came on Black Flag’s
Family Man LP, which was part
spoken word, part music. “Here
I come, family. man. I come to
infect. I come to rape your
woman. I come to take your
children into the street  I want
to crucify you on your front door
with nails from your well-stocked
garage." This isn't the stuff
Hallmark cards are made of.

Time hasn’t mellowed Henry
in the least, but it has molded his
outlook on life. His painful
experiences have become the
catalyst for learning and
understanding. Henry has
funneled his restless,‘ violent
energy into a positive outlet.

His hyperactive childhood
(which he claims he spent
drugged up on Ritalin) with an
anything—but-normal family and
the crazy‘ situations he found
himself in on the road with his
bands are the basis for many of
his “parables.” To teach people
from his experiences and mistakes
is his gC>al.

Henry’s chats are filled with
intensity and honesty. He
oscillates from burning social
concerns to his confrontations

with the police (“pigs,” as he calls
them), but he always manages to
brighten the mood with his cynical
humor. He has no qualms about
making himself the brunt of his
jokes. You can’t help but respect
a man who can discuss his
masturbation techniques in front
of 200 people!
Whether it’s
cockroaches in his

tormenting
East

Hollywood apartment, recalling
his psycho mechanical—drawing
teacher from junior high, or
battling the white middle-class
attitude that he’s grown to detest,
Henry has a quip for it all.

Even the one addiction he
allows himself, women, is a
subject for hours of hilarious
rhetoric. My favorite is the one
about the girl who wouldn’t let

him finish his lovemaking
escapade. He waited until she
was asleep and then beat off onto
her head. “A lot came out, too!,”
he said. Then, to compound her
dilemma, he glued all the cases to
her Black Flag cassettes shut.
Henry might not sound like the
best guy to party with, but at least
he’s honest -— something that
doesn’t exist much in our society.

You can be as tough as Rocky
Marciano or as nice as the pope,
but if you’re not honest about
yourself, it doesn’t mean a thing.

Henry speaks, thinks and lives
entirely in the same mode: full
throttle. His dialogue comes in
well-thought, riﬂed blasts ——short
and to the point. To see Henry
Rollins live is the ultimate

Brecht/Weill musical takes on fresh meaning

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer

Sometimes circumstances have
a way of making things turn out
better than the original blueprint.
Such is the case with Happy End,
the Bertolt Brecht/Kurt Weill
musical now playing at Stephen
Foster Memorial Theatre.

Originally chosen because of
the new openness in Eastern
Europe, the musical now takes
on a fresher, more universal
meaning in light of the world at
war.

“Let’s forget our little quarrels
and stand together. The world
belongs to all of us. Let’s march
together and make it our own,”
urges Sister Lillian Holiday, a
modern—day saint at the local
Salvation Army. ,

In Happy End, the Salvation
Army is the spark needed to
change the lives of society’s
criminals and outcasts, men who
revel and thrive in a basement

StephenAnde1-sonandGregLongenhagen inPitt's theater production bar known as Bill’s Beer Hall,

nowhere else to turn for shelter
in 1919 Chicago. When 5iSt€f
Lillian and her hallelujah chorus
show up, women see that there is
an alternative to life in the beer
hall, although the men who are
regular customers only view the
Salvation Army sisters as sex
objects.

Bill Cracker, owner of the beer
hall and hit-man extraordinaire,
is the exception. He is genuinely
attracted to Sister Lillian, and the
feeling is mutual.

The basic premise of Happy
End is the age-old notion that
love conquers all, even a “fallen”
Salvation Army saint and her
opposition, a man on the other
side of the law.

Despite the focus on the power
of love in the urban jungle, Happy
End was originally written as a
follow—up to the highly successful
Three Penny Opera. Brecht and
Weill strived to create a musical
that would appeal to as large an

audience as Three Penny Opera,

controversially oppose the
Marxist cause.

Due to the social upheaval of
the time, the musical was not
well-received. Today the anti-
Marxist_ undertones seem mild.
The show’s biggest production
number, a song which recurs
throughout the production, has
beer hall patrons, including a
homeless mother, singing “God
bless Henry Ford and
Rockefeller.” It’s a strikingly
memorable scene to watch
people dressed in tattered ra-gs
joyfully belting out the perks of
capitalism.

As Sister Lillian Holiday,
Barbara Stuart brings zest and
fervor to her role. During her
long epic—like song when she
tells Bill bitter secrets from her
past, she reaches deep inside her
character and exposes a side Bill
and the audience have never
seen. She does this in a way that

makes us believe that she 

reliving this experience for the
first time. ~
Greg Longenhagen couldn’t

Cracker, Holiday's love interest.
He brings a smirk and a wink to
everything he says, capitalizing
on the image of the Chicago
gangster who actually has a heart
underneath the pinstriped suit.

For the Pitt News

The first Student Art Exhibition
and Competition, held at the
Conney B. Kimbo Gallery, opened
on February 11, 1991, and
involved 74 students of varying
backgrounds, interests and levels
of proficiency.

The acrylic triptych “Church”
by Melissa Ralke, a junior studio
arts major, is a non—composite
study of texture, color and
movement. The three panels are
hung in descending order from
left to right. The left panel is a
vertical composition of yellows,
oranges and whites with a very
smooth texture and a glossy ﬁnish.

It is unexciting, however, com-
pared to the richness and
experimentation that happens in
the other two panels. The artist
achieves marvelous things by
cutting into the canvas of the
center panel with a knife and
contrasting the horizontal cuts
with dynamic circular movement
of color.

A very intriguing and charming
piece by Tim Martin, a senior
philosophy major, is “Saltine Can
Mobile.” This small sculpture
consists of an old metal saltines
can that serves as the base of a
Calderian mobile. (A huge metal

mobile by Alexander Calder hangs
suspended from the ceiling in the
Carnegie Museum of Art.)

A thick metal wire juts in an
elegant curve out of the can lid to
support the precariously balanced
arrangement of thin metal rods
and triangular fins. The
composition of the piece is static
and contained. The juxtaposition
of a commonplace item an
abstract composition at the same
time makes the piece very playful.

A number of the works
exhibited depict — with varying
degrees of success — buxom
women. Among the less
successful works is an acrylic
painting by John J. Petrush, a
student at Pitt School of Law ,
entitled “Say Yes.” Abig-breasted
female torso in three-quarter view
is depicted in-front of a television
test picture. On the woman’s
shoulder is a cannabis tattoo.
Eroticism is acceptable in art, and
Petrush does exhibit comparative
craftsmanship, but the painting
has problems, nevertheless.

Breasts, stomach and the
background pattern are the only
developed elements in the
painting. The treatment of other
areas is incomplete. By contrast,
electronic engineering major
Kristopher W. Rhen’s pencil
drawing “Solitude,” which depicts

S—3

 

  Student Art shown at Union

a winged blonde woman
(wearing a two—piece bathing suit
and sitting on an overhang in a
mountainous fantasy landscape)
is much more successful. Not
only is the whole person shown,
but the ﬂoating rocks in the
background are as much part of
the drawing as the woman in the
foreground.

The winners of the art
competition are as follows:
Overall winner —— William V.
Ganis, junior/studio arts
(“Montage XXIV”), and Ann Marie

_ Photograph by Simon Crane
Gothic band And Also The Trees, a product of English countryside.

By Mike Kegg

For the Pitt News

Imagine stepping away from
your cumbersome and
industrialized 20th-century
existence into a realm crafted
from the brilliance of Thomas
Hardy or Edgar Allan Poe. A
landscape void of the trappings
of modern life, one of turbulent
romanticism and unending
hardship. Welcome to the world
of And Also The Trees. _

A product of the English
countryside, And Also The Trees

formed in 1979 and hail from
Worchestershire. The band’s
lineup has remained relatively
consistent over the years, with
Simon Huwjones on vocals, Justin
Jones on guitar, Steven Burrows
on bass and Nick Havas on drums.
Recently the musical progressions
and consequent growth have led
to the addition of keyboardist
Mark Tibenham, who joined the
quartet before the release of the
band’s third record, “The Millpont
Years.”

It is not easy to provide a
simple description of the music

of And Also The Trees. Inﬂuences

range from English Romantic «aw

literature to the modern cinematic
genius of Roman Polanski. “I’m
an avid reader of literature,” says

Simon, “but not of many modern

writers. That partly explains why

I so much of what I write is set in

the past. There’s also the fact that
I don’t consider the 20th century
to be very complementary to the
countryside. And since the
countryside is my single most
important inﬂuence, I tend to go
back to a time when man was an
integral part of the natural world.”

a vividly compelling
experience. When one discovers
the splendor of And Also The

ballads or quiet, melancholy

movement’ of 4AD recording
artists such as the Cocteau Twins
or Difjuz, and many early classical
composers who found themselves
inspired by the same situations
inﬂuencing And Also The Trees.

At other times, we witness the
band unleashing a frenzied,
euphoric intensity which remains
unmatched throughout the entire
progressive genre of music. The
combination of justin’s swirling,
hypnotic guitar arrangements and
Simon’s half—sung/half-spoken
lyrics leave you completely

enchanted.

And Also The Trees released
its first single, “Shantell,” and
self-titled album in 1983. Shortly
after this release, Robert Smith,
an avid Trees fan, invited the
band along on tour with The
Cure, thus providing the Trees
with the needed exposure to
promote their second record,
“Virus Meadow.”

1990 found And Also The Trees
back in the studio with Robert
Smith, this time to produce the
new single, “The Pear Tree.” Its
ambient and brooding quality

reﬂects the continual atmospheric
progression which And Also The
Trees seems to be creating. Once
again, the emphasis remains on
the environmental. “I spend days
without seeing anyone, sitting at
my window looking at the fields
and the vanishing countryside,”
says Simon. “It’s a timeless sort of
place. Nothing changes, and I
can feel a power from the ground.
There used to be a church where
we live and the village was wiped
out by the Black Death and
corroded into the ground. It’s a
mysterious place, and I can feel

Musical

Continued from page S-2

DeVincent are tremendously fun
to watch as Dr. Nakamura and
Sam Wurlitzer, respectively.

The music for Happy End
ranges from large ensemble
numbers to solos which serve as
monologues for the characters.
The larger numbers seem to work
better, but every song is
entertaining.

I could go on for 10 days about

Stephen Coleman’s direction, but
I don't have the space, so I’ll
recap the highlights. Each
character is painted as a vivid
piece of a much larger picture.
When a new character comes on
stage, they almost resemble a
Colorform (remember them?)
against an empty canvas.

One of the most technically
memorable scenes from Happy

End involves a bank robbery.

Through the use of strobe lights,
Coleman creates the look and
feel of a silent ﬁlm chock~full of
bumbling criminals and even a
stick of dynamite or two.

In the final scene, it’s Christmas
Eve, and everyone is celebrating
and relieved to kiss their lives of
crime goodbye. In the midst of all

the festivities, Santa Claus appears .
with a bottle of gin, trashed off T

his boots.
