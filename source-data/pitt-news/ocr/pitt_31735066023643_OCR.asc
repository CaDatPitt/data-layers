By PEGGY FERRI
Pitt News Staff Writer ‘
Mary Jo Wilson, after being on

the Staff Advisory Board (SAB) for.
the .

two (years, -resigned - at
September 10 meeting of the SAB
as ' Vice Chairperson" and the
representative of zone six, her area
of representation. ' ‘

The Staff Advisory Board of the
University of Pittsburgh is
representative of approximately
3,000 staff ,employees excluding
faculty, staff covered by collective
bargaining units and those located
on regional campuses. Sixty-five
elected representatives from 21
geographical zones meet_rnonthly to
provide a channel between staff and
administration on issues relevant to
the staff.

“My decision to resign, was

building; due to the manner in

which the proposal came to rewrite_

the by—laws,” Wilson explained..
“I have been around the universi-
ty for 14 years and.have seen’ some
very difficult times, but I have
always worked for people I

respected and in good working con-
ditions. So I can’t say I ran for the
SAB because I have a chip on my
shoulder, but I had the time and the
energy and I thought I could do a
service for those who didn’t.

“Let’s just say that I didn’_t agree "i

with Karen Adams’ ‘exclusionary
/and  elitist A methods of
recruitment,” Wilson said referring
to the cause of her resignation.

  A Review Of Pitt's

Pitt News Staff Writer
‘I Pitt’s revised ’ visitation policy,

 which wentintoeffect last May, is

‘currently «undergoing an “ongoing

 review,"’- according‘ to Office of

Residence Life ' Director JoAnn
Woodson.

The revised policy states, in part,
that oyernight guests must be of the

same sex as the resident host. An I

overnight guest is deﬁned as one
who remains in. a‘room between“t'he
hours of 2:00 and 8:00 a.m., Mon-
‘day through Friday,_according to
the policy. _

Previously, Pitt employed a 24‘_

hour “open”-visitation policy.

A catalyst in the board of
trustees’ decision to call for‘ it
change in visitation regulations last
October was a rape and murder in
the residence halls.

On the morning’ of January 4,
1979, the body of a Pitt student was
found in a trash room directly
below Tower A.

Andrew Young, Former U.N. 0

old Monica Renee Jones, a
freshman from Philadelphia, drew
attention to Pitt’s security pro-
cedures and raised questions about

the substance and enforcement of ‘

Pitt’s visitation policy.

" In early September of last year, 0

Pittsburgh’ policeman were ‘in-

_ves_tigating the possibility that

Sidney Brinkley, a- 24-year-old

Tower B room of his girlfriend
Estelle. Hill for five months accor-
ding to the mother of a resident of
Hill's floor. A

The mother reported that
Brinkley “went into the bathrooms

showers, and hung around‘ the halls
all the time.”

VISTA: Concerned  With  the Causes and Results

By JANE HOLAHAN ' '

Pitt News Staff Writer

In 1964 ‘President Lyndon
Johnson declared a war on poverty
and established VISTA (Volunteers
In Service To America) to help win
that war. Since then over 50,000
volunteers have served in VISTA.

The conditions, causes and
results of poverty are what concerns
the VISTA volunteer. The war on
poverty is far from over. and
VISTA’s main goal is to improve
the, quality of peoples lives who are
locked into the cycle of poverty.

This can mean anything from
forming consumer protection pro-
grams to helping to organize re-

“Part. pf the ‘problem in, the-
poverty comrnunity is the lack of
self esteem or self worth. VISTA is
trying to instill in people the notion
that what they do does make a dif-
ference,”, according to Garry
Schaedel, a VISTA volunteer "who

VISTA volunteers serve a one

Polly Gault, Ric/hard Schweiker’s

Gault acknowlegded.

The bill which included many 'H.R. 5192 revises the student

Hard wank and Satisfaction Raise Honors Program

By PATI‘ I LANGFOR_D

Pitt News Staff ,Writer

Stewart attributed this increase in
student participation largely to the

' challenge and satisfaction students

"have found in UHP courses.‘ He

The University Honors Program
(UHP) has found that hard work
and satisfaction do indeed go hand
in hand, as this term the program
reports an all time high enrollment
of roughly 560.

According to Dr. Alec‘ Stewart,
director of the program, registra-
tion for .honors courses has been
steadily increasing since the pro-
gram’s beginning in the winter term
of 1978, which saw only an
estimated 125 registrations.

1979-1980 honors program student
survey, which showed:

1) 83 percent of the students
found UHP courses “more” or
“much more”‘ challenging than
their non-UHP courses. '

2) 82 percent of the students
found that either “more” or
“much more” effort" was required

4) 93 percent reported that they
wanted to take more UHP courses.

Stewart explained that the survey
was a mandatory part of a quality
control system that enables the pro-
gram to judge’ the success of the
class as well as the performance of
the teacher’. ,

On the faculty level, the control
system demands a formal course
proposal stating faculty initiative
and a specified course content; he
added. ‘ A

Stewart emphasized that the pro-
gram is intended to be demanding

_of both faculty and students. “It is
basically a program for students,
-who are willing to work a little bit
harder to learn a little bit more, and
to feature faculty members who are
supportive of -their efforts. We
want the faculty members to be
conscientious,” he said.

Although the program maintains,

- that students with a QPA of 3.25 or

above can take honors courses with

“no ‘questions asked,” any student-
can participate in the program by’

filling out a special permission
form, if he/she doesn’t ‘fulfill the

f formal entry requirements.

“The thrust of the program is_to .,

Parents will ‘have to begin repay-
ment after 60 days with nine percent
interest. The amount of money that
can be borrowed will depend on the
cost of the individual school.

The bill alsohas a provision for
student borrowers to report to
credit bureaus their record of stu-
dent loan repayment. This will
enable students’ to establish their
credit record after they have finish-
ed their post-secondary, education.

Eduardo Wolle, Legislative
Director of the United States Stu-

,dent Association,’ thinks that this
. bill will-help the economy.

1 “Under H.R. 5192, there will be

_ a $300 million savings on student

loans for fiscal year 1981. And over
the five year period ther will be a
savings of’ $2.3 billion,” Wolle
said. ,  ,

students, who say we’re here to‘
work. To the best of my
knowledge, ahighly motivated stu-
dent, who has a reasonable
QPA_—maybe not a 3.25—and has
requested special permission, has-
never been denied that opportunity
to participate in the program,”
Stewart said. » ’

Residents of__the floor said that

— The resident assistant involved

’ refused comment on whether or not

she had received any complaints". '

ORL directoor Woodson said last
fall: “at this point, I can not
remember whether it was reported
to us or not, but if it was, it was

_ moreilikely taken through the area

coordinator at the time.”

Woodson alddedlthat sufficient
information concerning proper

had been distributed to students.

Brinkley was arraigned last‘ Oct-
ober on charges of killing Jones and

" Brinkley had also been accused in ~

the slaying of his girlfriend’s sister,
a Philadelphia teacher, and an
Atlantic Richfield executive.

‘ Brinkley is to stand trial next

month. .

The focus then turned from »

Brinkley’s fate to a look at visita-
tion regulations.  g l

“very strongly that they wanted a
change” in the residence hall
policy, Vice Chancellor for Student

year.

Kimboappointed a task force last
November to make changes in the
residence hall regulations. The task
force consisted of four students, a
faculty; member, the Inter-
Residence Board advisor, and John
Vrana,_assistant vice chancellor for
business and finance.

The final report .of the task-force(
recommended a limit of three con-
secutive days for students to host
overnight (12 a.m. to 7 a.m.)
guests. The report also. sugested
that students be allowed to have

overnight guests no more than 30..

days per term.

Kimbo studied the final report of
the task force, and drafted recom-
mendations, which were reviewed
by Senior Vice chancellor Jack
Freeman and other members of (the

~ administration’s senior staff. v I

. Pitt administrators announced in
early February of last yearthat they

had approved a new residence hall «

policy.

The policy prohibited residents
from hosting guests of the opposite
sex from 2 to ‘I0 a.m. and limited
each student to hosting overnight
guests for no more than 30 days per
term. .

Student leaders were unhappy
with the new policy.

said the new policy would be dif-
ficult to implement, and added that
“I still find’ it difficult to unders-

residence halls.

Three days after the forum, the
IRB held a meeting at which it was

announced . the IRB had retained “
the services of two attorneys to ad- .

vise the board on legal matters per-
taining to the policy. '

Butfl/ess than two weeks after 'ap- ‘
. proving a new residence hall policy,‘

Pitt administrators revised it I to
allow students to host overnight

guests of .th_e’opposite sex on_

weekends. ’

Ruggero Aldisert, chairman of
the board of trustees student‘ affairs
committee,‘ stated at the meeting
that the’ administration would sub-
mit a report reviewing how the
policy operated-, shortly after the
spring term. '1 '-

The _ said _that the decision to
review the policy was an important
result of the meeting. ‘

The review," operation and en-

similar to the Peace Corps there is
often culture shock. _
Schaedel had lived in Burlington,
Vermont before signing up for
VISTA and being sent to Helena,
Montana, with a population of

2500. -

“I had culture shock for a long
time. Therewas a sense of isolation
and individualism,” he recalled.

Schaedel’s job in Montana’s

Human Rights Division was to tell -

minority groups, “if you’re'
discriminated against do something
about it and conversely to tell
employers there was‘ a possibility
they could have lawsuits.”

Because much-of what VISTA
volunteers do involves Working
through the legal system, people
with legal backrounds are in de-
mand. _ .

VISTA volunteers work through

 

the legal system in such areas as
mental health. the environment,

_ and consumer affairs.

In dealing with consumer affairs,
lawyers or people with legal
backrounds might be asked to han-
dle class action suits for low income
groups on consumer issues, or
develop and implement work shops
dealing with consumer fraud,
deceptive trade practices, or truth in
advertising. ‘

VISTA lawyers and volunteers
with legal backrounds have helped
low income groups to participate in
selecting a site for a power station‘
and nuclear reactors, and likewise

helped people assert their right not '

to have the power stations an

_ nuclear reactors built. ' _ /-

I A legal backround is only one of
the many areas VISTA is interested
in. The ability to organize is often

. more important than any technical

«skill one might have.

Schaedel’s first job in Montana
was to get publicity for the Mon-
tana Human Rights Division. This
meant contacting the media, going
out on the road to meet people and
writng articles about the VISTA
program.

VISTA volunteers have to be able
to work with not only low income
groups, but also civic groups, the
business community and ‘local

government officials.

Often it is up to the VISTA

volunteer to convince the business —

community to donate money for a

neighborhood program or to work‘

with government officials to get un-
fair laws or policies changed,
according to Schaedel. V
He pointed to an example in St.
Louis: ‘
“Raw sewage was being dropped
into the drinking water in a low in-

 

come area. It wa's,a_ major concern»
but nothing happened. VISTA got_
people together to try to identify

The VISTA volunteers brought
large groups of people together,
enabling them to have a larger voice
and thus get things done.

“It was difficult to initially distill
that feeling,” he said, referring to
the feeling that they could not.do
anything about it. “But now» they

are ready -to take on new challenges, ‘

to improve the quality of their own
lives.”

This is the main emphasis of.

VISTA, to make people self-reliant,
to enable them to work themselves
to improve their lives.

Right now there are approximate-
ly 4,000 people_ in VISTA according
to Schaedel, but the number is ex-
pected .to rise to 5,000‘next year. I

During the Vietnam War it was
up to local draft boards whether or
not a VISTA volunteer was exempt
from the draft and Schaedel expects
thatlto be the case if the draft is

  

reinstated.

As it headslinto the l980’st_l1ree

things rank as priority concerns" for

VISTA; energy, independent living ‘

(people who had lived on welfare or
in institutions often need help gain-
ing independence in their lives) and
domestic abuse (child and spouse
abuse). . - I

Presently VISTA volunteers are"

dealing with almost every social ser-
vice in the United States. The dif-
ference with VISTA is that itstgoal
is independence. ' ~

in VISTA volunteers provide low
income people with resources, skills

and knowledge so that they have a"

greater voice in their lives and their
community’s life, and break the cy-

cle of poverty that runs through ‘

their lives.

‘To get more information contact .‘

“The Committee was absolutely
valid. Karen used all kinds of staff
people; some active now, some ac-
tive in the past, and some have
never been active in the
SAB. . .What we tried to do_was get
a cross section of the people and
their perspectives on the Commit-
tee,” said Waterkotte, acting SAB
chairperson.

79 percent of those on the by-
laws committee were current or

/former SAB members. 59 percent
were current, and 21 percent were
non-SAB members, according to
figures presented by Adams.
Adams, however, was unclear
about the composition of the non-
D_AB members: “I wrote down the

~ names of people whom I knew from
before,” Adams said.

“The idea was to address each
area of theby-laws separately. One
could serve on more than one com-
mittee and others did work on more

“As an idea for somethingto
work with,” Adams added, “I cut
parts from the by-laws and Senate
by-laws and sorted ‘them into piles
according to committee (elections,
representation, officers &"organiza-
tions, and mechanics). This was a
rough draft at the end, and because
it was so close to the September
meeting, I typed it up. It was put to
a vote and I was given the O.K. to
undraft the rough draft. Cole Van
Ormer, member at large, will be
working in the undrafting of
Representation and Elections and I
will be working on the undrafting

chaired the by-laws comrnittee, also
resigned. Achman had indicated to
Wilson that she had also not been
notified of all the vs_ub-committee
meetings -which were going on (to

' which she was assigned).

But concerning Wil§on’,s resigna-
tion, Waterkotte explain’ed: “Mary
Jo Wilson really. shouldn't be the
focus of the story. I’m not trying to
b_e difficult, it’s just that I don’t
want to appear to’ be slamming
anyone’. My first thought is to give
you a ‘no comment,’ but I want to
say that this is ‘a personality
issue. . .I’m sorry it happened.”

In addition, Dolores Gallagher,

first alternate to zone 17, resigned

September 11, 1980. The following

“Karen’s abrupt manner in try-\ is an excerpt of her Sept.‘ 11 letter of

ing to do it immediately because she

weeks in August didn’t sit well with
me,” Wilson recalled. “She came
with a list of people already assign-
ed to the sub-committees she had
created and tokenly went through
the by-laws chairperson to do this.”

Wilson wasn’t the only person to
resign. Sandy Haber, chairperson
prior to_ Wilson, was the first to
resiLn_r_e_cently.

‘resignation to Watterkotte:

“I believe that the greatest

weakness of the Staff Advisory‘

Board is its lack of commitment
toward dialoguing and com-
municating with Staff. I believe
th.at-communicating with the_ Staff
is the basic ingredient and reason
for the SAB’s existence at all.

Because this does not exist, the SAB
has become another bureaucratic
dimension in stc_z_[f_'I_ifg_—_i_t__.§/_z_ould_

Season:

 

K - .

a SERVICE to Staff. ” ,

She continued, “Another
weakness, as I see it, is the presence"
on the Board of long term members
who are able to inﬂuence the
Board ’s'thinking. . This is a difficul-
ty, because these individuals have
been part of the leadership of the

_ SAB that has been incompetent for

the duration of its existence. ”

Gallagher concluded, “It would
be better to have no SAB, than to
have an incompetent,‘ ‘ineffectual
organization. ”

On September 19, the SAB had a
meeting to review some of the pro-
posals and, as Watterkotte plit it,
“to make sure that everyone who is
interested can get involved in it.”’

' By ,a majority vote of the seven
SAB members, pfesent, the Pitt
News was not allowed ‘to , tape-
record the meeting, but was permit-
ted to take notes. Brieﬂy, the
restructuring proposals as stated in
a hand-out at the meeting were:

, \—the name of theSAB will be
changed to the “University of Pitt-
sburgh Staff Association,” and will
meet at least twice a year as an all-
inclusive staff assembly to maintain
adequate communications.

—a sub-group of the UPSA, the
Staff Association Council (SAC)
would consist of about 31 members
from four zones and will meet’six
times a year. ’

—one set, of officers: president,
vice-president, and secretary would

,- be elected to direct both the UPSA
A" and the SAC. : ' s '

“But you just‘ can’t give this
structure to the staff and expect ac-l
ceptance," contended Wilson. ‘,‘If
the grass roots is involved with the
planning from the word go, then
they would be more willing to ac-
cept the end result,” she emphasiz-
ed. ‘ . ' . i I
.‘_‘It’s a more effective process in
the end to involve the people involv-
ed,” Wilson added.

“Communications between/
members leaves much to be desired. .
The SAB has no budgetso we have

to go through Human Resources,
which has always been very‘ suppor-
tive of us, but we are always depen-
dent upon someone else doing
things for us, as if we weren’t
capable; The staff of this institu-
tion is just as much professionals as
anyone else on all levels. There are
many people out there besides
management who are capable of
writing these proposals and haven’t
been tapped, \

“And when there’s 'a chance to
really make the SAB workable for
everybody again, they bring in a
little elite group. Memos had been
sent out to SAB reps, alternates,
and volunteers, but that is a small
clickwhich is, by design and action,
still limited,” Wilson explained.

“A lot of people, and myself,
think that the Board is close to
dissolving. Dolores Gallagher said
that it’s been inept since the beginn-
ing andla new structure is not going
to change its ineptness.

“The only‘ time it does work is i

_money. But after the issue is taken

ple have to realize that in addition
to those issues, you’ve got to work
on the‘drudges, on the committees,
and on the proposals.

“The proper leadership and peo-

« ple who could commit all the time,

a tremendous amount, can save the
SAB. There would also have to be a
definition of who the SAB 531":

_ represents and how. It can’t be all

things to all people.”

However, Waterkott ' said she
does not feel the SAB is weak.
“No, there are no weaknessesin the
_SAB. A weakness now is what
we’re trying to improve.”

Nevertheless, Wilson does not
put all the blame on the SAB.

“I’m not saying the SAB is at
total‘ fault at how things are going:
but I think they are not the solution
to the problem, that they are not
the problem, but they certainly are
symtomatic of the problem.”

Living andleaming
  Democracy-Pitt Sstyle

Almost two 'years have passed since an 18-year-old
freshman, from Philadelphia was found raped and
murdered in a basement Tower A washroom.

Two classes of students have graduated since that cold

'-January night when a campus policeman and a university
custodian found the brutally beaten body of Monica‘Renee
Jones hastily stashed in a dormitory chamber.

- At the time of the Jones murder, many present day Pitt
students~were miles away from Pittsburgh, completing their
junior and senior years in high school. For them it is dif-

rt , i ficult to fully realize the fear and confusion that beset the

Pitt campusat that time. It is especially difficult for these
students to realize the widespread feeling of betrayal ex-
perienced by most when it was discovered that the accused

. murderer, “a non-student who has been found guilty of

" . , similarcharges in the Philadelphia area,” was illegally shar-

ing a Tower B room withhis girlfriend for up to five mon-

  ths before the murder. It is for theserstudents this editorial

is written. ,

. ‘Female Tower B residents interviewed by_ The Pitt News
last year said that Sidney Brinkley had in fact lived on and
many times harassed residents of the eighth floor of that

' building. I

According to those residents, Brinkley’s presence had
been reported to Office of Residence Life officials.
However, residence life officials said that these reports had

’ not been heard by the appropriate ears within that office.

As a result of the disclosure of Brinkley’s illegal presence

’ in the residence hall, Pitt drew negative publicity from

' sburgh National Bank! Even if I’m

‘ a C1lStOII1CI'.

S members of the local media. The university, which is at
present preparing for a projected drastic drop in enrollment
in the 1980s, could not afford the bad publicity nor the

» creation of the image of Pitt as an unsafe urban university.
To offset this bad press, the university was forced to quick-
ly formulate some course of action to assure that,’ or at least
give the impression that a tragedy such as the Jones murder
would never happen again. V

ll

Last spring shortly before the annual room lottery, Pitt
officials announced that a new residence hall visitation
policy would become effective with the beginning of the
springterm. Under this policy students would not be per-
mitted visitors of the opposite sex between 2 a.m. and 8
a.m. . ‘

The new policy drew furious‘.opposition from members
of the residence halls community, an opposition that still
smolders in the minds of many returning residents.

That opposition, which came in the form of boisterous
confrontations between residents and Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Conney Kimbo and a sit—in at the spring
board of trustees meeting, was based on the rights spelled
out in the Student Rights WITHIN the University Com-
munity, a document approved by the trustees.

.That document gives ‘(or did give) students the right to:

—asso ‘ate with whomsoever they please.

—to,be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, col- _

or, creed, religion, natural or gin or handicap. -

—to be. heard and have one’s views considered within the
university community. ' '

It would seem that this document is a genuine attempt to
protect the’ rights of the students here at the univer-
sity-—that is, as long as this protection does not interfere
with the image of the university.

It also seems that the university has been given the option_

of interpreting its policy statements to suit its‘ own needs,
policy statements containing rights very similar to those
outlined in the U.S. V Constitution. In the case of the
residence hall visitation policy, the university administra-
tion has overridden the policy that states that studentsmay
“associate with whomsoever they please.” And although
students were permitted to have"their‘ “views heard within
the university community,” it doesn’t really matter» to have
this right if no one listens. V ,

And although in this case, students have really not been

discriminated against on the basis of sex, color, creed,

Page 10—Monday, September 22, 1980

» /

religion, natural origin or handicap, what is to say that in
the future the university will not take it upon itself to inter-
pret policy to avoid the granting of these or other constitu-
tional rights. . .if such an interpretation would suit the
needs of the occasion. _

We here at The Pitt News know that this is an old story,
one that most of you heard time and time again when the

' visitation policy was first “discussed” last spring. But, as

stated before, there are new faces on the Pitt campus, faces
that have not yet grown accustomed to living and learning
in democracy—Pitt style.

_ But as the official student newspaper of the university it
is our duty to inform and sometimes remind under a right
to freedom of the press given us by the Constitution of the
United States—a right that to date has not yet come under
the administration’s interpretive knife. -

You probably thought you were
clever, demanding that the people

but I beat the system then. My
father and my employer both bank
at PNB, so I guess I was regarded as

 occasional reluctant teller who’d

check approved, but they always
came through.

When I went in the bank last
year, I noticed the wording on their
threatening signs had changed.
You must be a Pittsburgh National

said. That’s silly, I thought, expec-

The cashier innocently asked if

I decided to forego a confronta-

to an officer.

With my brand-new photo

an_.officer’s desk.

“May I help you?”

I smiled. ‘fl was hoping, you

My eyes narrowed. “‘No--”

She thrust it back at me. “I’m

“We can’t just hand seventy

to the Wilkinsburg office.”
I started to show her my full-

‘You Are There, ' The 1980 Debates‘

By WALTER R. WATSON

“Good morning, boys and girls,

and welcome to another integral.

part of American history in the con-
tinuing series of “YOU ARE
THERE.” I’m Dan Rather, your
host, and today, we are going to go
in a Baltimore
auditorium, where, five minutes

from now, two of 1980’s Presiden—.

tial candidates, Republican Ronald
Reagan, and Independent John B.
Anderson, are about to go before
the League of Women Voters, and
the American’ public, to‘debate the‘

issues of that time, offering their
opinions on why the incumbent,
President Jimmy Carter, should not
be elected to a second term of of-
fice. Mr. Cater, for reasons of cam-
paign strategy, has decided to
decline from entering the first of the
LWV debates, which in recent
years, have been found to be very
influential in forming the choices of
who the American public votes for
on.Election Day. It is September
21, 1980, and YOU-ARE-THERE!

REAGAN: Are you nervous,

ANDERSON: Why, Ron, do

back of the check. When he look-
ed at my Secret Service Press Pass,
he glanced up at..me ‘and asked,
“You a disc jockey?”

“No, I do news.”

He looked disappointed but
okayed the check anyway.

On the way home I realized
they’d done absolutely nothing but
make a, phone call and check my
identification. Why couldn't they
do that in Oakland? I'd assume
PNB can afford phones which
interconnect their offices.

The only motivation I can see is
that PNB was trying its best to
railroad me into opening an ac-
count in Oakland so I can cash my
checks. Well‘ forget it, PNB.

I don’t get along with checking
accounts. A bank in Santa Clara,
California gave away $375 of my
money without my permission this
summer——they convinced me that
banks are not the best way to han-
dle money. I rarely have enough
funds to warrant a checking ac-
count, much less a savings account.
Besides, there isn’t a bank around

.which pays interest faster than in-

flation eats money. Why save?
Oh yeah, PNB—Dad’s banked
with you folks for about twenty
years, but he’s giving strong con-
sideration to relocating his dollars.

Pi ii   Not

‘To the Editor: .

Thank you for giving me the op-
portunity to express my view? on
Higher Education to the students of
the University of Pittsburgh. As a

recent’ graduate of the University, I

am well aware of the financial
havoc caused by a tuition increase"

of $200 and the long history of such

increases ever since the University

became state-related. I am also
aware of the immense contribution
that Pitt‘has made not only to
graduates like myself, but to the
thousands of individuals who are
employed there. A
To answer your question directly,
I am in favor of a larger commit-
ment from the state budget to
Higher Education in Pennsylvania.

However, it is not a simple matter -

Gefﬁrig Fair Shd

of raising more revenues to meet
that need. It is rather a case of cut-
ting elsewhere in the budget to meet
that need. My personal feeling is
that Basic and Secondary Educa-

‘ tion gets the lion’s share of the state,

_‘ monies while Higher Education is
given the leftovers. Even our pro-

cess of designating Pitt, Penn State, -

Temple and others "as non-
preferreds clearly indicates this
.disparity. in commitment. That is
why I am a co-sponsor to Represen—
tative Cowell’s House Bill 158
iwhich proposes a constitutional
amendment to put an end to this
‘ ‘hostage’ ’ system_ of appropriating
money for Higher Education.

‘Yet’ that is not enough. Within
the category of Higher Education,

there are also disparities in the‘

 

distribution of funding. ,Why is it,
for example, that the state-owned
colleges and universities consistent-
ly receive larger percentage in-

creases in their budgets over those

of the state-related universities and
the community colleges?

__ cellence of -the professors at Pitt,
Penn State and Temple.
You should not forget that the

university itself is _not entirely‘
blameless either. I have yet to hear
a chancellor from any one of our’
major universities address this issue
directly. Perhaps they fear even

  

re, Rep says

Indeed‘. -I.
most of state-owned schools pay T —
higher salaries even though their
teaching staffs cannot begin to '_ ~
compare with the educational
backgrounds and ‘teaching ex-~

 

further ‘funding; reprisals. Never-

theless, the chancellors of the state- *

related universities, as spokesman
for that sector of the academic com-
munity, must take the responpsibility
for delivering this message:

\Higher Education is not get-
ting its fair share of funding vis-
a-vis Basic Education in Penn-
sylvania; and the state-related

2 institutions are not gettingtheir

‘fair share of the monies ap-
propriated in Higher Education;

Furthermore, the chancellors and
boards of trustees of our state-
related-universities have to get off
‘their high horse and begin dealing
with the realities of the l980’s.

Neither this state not any other will
long continue the practice of pour-
-ing public monies into massive
building programs that bear no

‘relation to future enrollments and ‘ J I

are not accountable to the citizens .
who pay for them. As the univer-
sities shift more and more toward ‘J

public monies as their source of in-
come, so also must they change
their ways of doing business.

I am hopeful that these com-
ments provide you with an idea of
my position on the issue oftfunding
Higher Education in Pennsylvania.
I am hopeful also that we can begin
changing our sporadic system of
distribution !into a fair and more
reasonable allocation based on
merit rather than political
fluence.

By SAM SCUILLO

“The heat wasn’t a factor, the

wind was a factor.”

Those were the words of Pitt
Coach Jackie Sherrill following. the

V 7 Panthers’ 18-3 defeat of the Kansas

‘Jayhawks at Memorial Stadium in

.' Lawrence, Kansas. The Jayhawks

*)__V  ~

weren’t Pitt’s‘only opponent Satur-
day. Winds at 25 miles per hour

combined with temperatures in the J

9015, made one wonder if either
team would be able to score a
touchdown. .

“I’ve seen a lot‘ of football games
here in Kansas when the ball never
crossed _the 50-yard line,” said
Sherrill.

Jayhawk punter Bucky Scribner

' didn’tseem to mind the ‘wind, pun-

ting 10 times for a 47.7 average.
P_itt’s Rick Ryan punted nine times
for a 27.3 average. But in most

' football games, the battle is won in

theinterior line play, and.Pitt was

. clearly dominant.

5 Following Terry White’s fumble

' of a punt, Bruce Kallmeyer booted‘

"a 20 yard field goal to give the

V Hawks their only points, and lead,

of the day, 3-0. / , ~

“The first quarter was a big fac-
tor in the game today,” said Sher-
rill. “There’s no telling what the
score would have been if Kansas

 capitalized on our turnovers and

  

their field position eﬁly in the
game. But weheld them off early.”
. Pitt’s initial score was aided by a
pass interference call against Kan-
sas. On a first and ten from Pitt’s
48, Artrell Hawkins took a pitch
out, ran to his left and threw for
intended receiver Dwight Collins,
who was illegaly bumped, giving
Pitt a first down at the Kansas 22.

Six plays later, "Dave Trout kicked a ‘

21-yard field goal to tie the score.
Pitt held, forced a punt and Dan
Marino hit Benjie Pryor for 21
yards to mid-field for a first down.
Again, Hawkins looked for Collins
on an ‘option- pass, and the
‘freshman flanker made an outstan-

Kansas. ‘

h At least two of the questions concerning Pitt’s
football team were answered in Saturday’s win over _

, Pantherssmother

ding catch to give the Panthers first
and goal at the seven. ’
Then, on third. and goal, Marino

‘ hit Pryor in the end zone to put Pitt

ahead to stay. It was the third
Marino to Pryor touchdown this
season. \ '

Late in the second quarter,
freshman halfback Joe McCall was
inserted” into the lineup and im-
mediatelypicked up ll yards on his

first collegiate run. tM’cCall’s per-«

formance could go a long way in

- determining who Pitt’s tailback will

be later in the season. Aftertthe
game, Sherrill hinted that McCall
would not be the starter against

. Temple next week, and that he

would continue to alternate with
Hawkins and Rooster Jones.

The Panthers asserted their
superiority at the outset of the se-

cond half, continuing to stymie the '

Jayhawk offense, —. while putting

together its best rushing perfor-

mance of the season.

“I was very pleased the wiy we

came-out. and played the second
half,” Sherrill said. “Our running

game took it to them. We came off ‘
the ball well and knocked them off 7

the ball.”
Midway through the third

, quarter, the Panthers started a drive

on their own 37. Jones immediately
scooted‘ around left end" for 25
yards, Pitt’s longest run ’ from

scrimmage this year, to the

Jayhawk ’38.
On third and seven, Marino hit

tight end Mike Dombrowski-for 12 ‘

yards and a first down at the Kansas
23.

Two plays later, that same com-
bination connected for a
touchdown, Marino lofting a spiral
straight downfield for Dom-
browski’s first career touchdown.
Dave Trout missed his second extra
point attempt of the season, and
Pitt’s lead was 16-3. ‘ M

By Samuel Sculllio

 

Joe McCall, from thesame Miami Jackson High
School which produced former Panthers El1_ott
Walker, -Cecil Johnson and Arnie Weatherington,
carriedthe ball 14 times for 74 yards, and was thrilled
‘by not only his, but the offensive line’s performance.

“The line really opened up the holes, and in the se-
cond half the running was real easy,” said McCall.
f‘I credit everything to the offensive line.”'

Collins’ switch from tailback also moved McCall
from behind Randy McMillan at fullback, to behind
Rooster Jones and Hawkins. _ ’

“At tailback, you get to see more,” McCall said in
answer to questions about the switch. “Lining up

seven yards behind the line of scrimmage gives you as

better view of the holes__and the blocking.”

And while the offense was making news, the Pitt
defense turned in its second consecutive solid perfor-

/mance, limiting the Jayhawks to four yards net

shutout,” he said. \“We’re a defense oriented team.
We try‘to get the offense the ball, and we do that.”

Tackle Greg Meisner, seeing his first-action of the
season, was impressed by Kansas’ determination, but
hinted that the J ayhawks were overmjatched this par-
ticular Saturday.

“They were really fired up for this game,’’’ said
Meisner. “They hung in there and never quit, but we
stuffed them pretty well.” '

t On the opposing side, Kansas’ freshman quarter-
back, Frank Seurer, who made his first collegiate
start, was a dejected man after the game ‘Saturday.

“I think it’s pretty obvious that Pitt’s one of the
best teams you’ll ever see,” he said. “I was expecting
them to be strong, but I thought we’d be able to do
more. They showed us a lot.”

And if Pitt’s offense can continue to improve, the
Panthersshould be well tuned for Maryland, Florida

  Booters Ploy Tough iBut Lose to Slippery Rock   -

By<ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pitt soccer team came ex-
tremely close to making it’s third
win but were defeated by Slippery
Rock in a close 2-1 contest on
Saturday. The Panthers went nose
to nose with the Slippery Rock
booters but lost by one. The game
was quite similar to two years ago
when the Panthers were defeated by
the identical score. I T
‘.‘It was a good, hard-fought con-
‘test, a typical Pitt-Slippery. Rock
( game,” said Coach Leo Bemis.

6 .

“3"Both teams had the opportunity
to score more goals than either one

of them did.’ ’

Bemis went on to say that he con- -

siders the Panthers to be at a big
disadvantage to many of their op-
ponentsldue to the manner of prac-
ticing that Pitt is forced to have bet-
ween games.
“What Slippery Rock has over us
and agnumber of other teams too, is
i being able to practice on a full size
field like the one that they will play
on in actual game situations. In our
case, we must adjust to a larger
field than -the one thatiwe practice

We only plays full field one day a

on a much smaller field. This causes
problems concerning bunching up

Pitt in the lead early in the game

showed a good effort on Norton’s

and the entire offense’s part in’
working the ball into the Rockets’ ,

half of the field. Norton’s goal
came with only 12 minutes gone in
the game. It was his second goal for
Pitt this season. _ I _
Slippery Rock were not to be
denied as they evened the score near

the end of the first half when Bob '

Black got one past goalie Scott
Thunberg. »
The second half went _scoreles
until Tony Hindley of Slippery
Rock went into action. Hindley, a
‘transfer player who is a newcomer

to Slippery Rock soccer; showed "
just how well he could work into the

system of play. With only 20
minutes gone in the second half,
Hindley turned on. the speed and

successfully pushed the ball left to .

score what turned out to be the win-

ning goal -of the game. Shortly’

before that he shot a ball that came
within inches of scoring.

The remainder of the half went
scoreless with last minute efforts by
the Panthers being unsuccessful.
Bemis believed that much /of the
problem throughout the afternoon
was due to the Panthers not being
able to take full control of the Slip-
pery Rock opponents. _

“No one was really able to take
charge of the game at most points,”
said Bemis. _“No one could effec-
tively set it up to score besides the

one by Norton. There were a

" number .of players that put in very

good efforts.” , ,
The Panthers will meet cross
town rivals Carnegie Mellon in a

home contest on Wednesday even- "i

ing. Game time is 7:15.

Although Pitt didn’t fare too well

 

Pitt players are walk-ons without

Dieffenback was optimistic. He was ./
especially pleased with White,

Wagner and Buss.

“They deserve a lot of credit for

very little recognition,” said Dief-
fenbach.

outstanding competition,” he said.

According to the coach~,_all of the

losing team, St. Bonaventure.
‘_‘Pitt is the only one without, and

 

that make it very hard to compete
with them, ” according to Dieffen-
bach. - .

Weinberg, Brand, and Wilson are
young and inexperienced, but the
coach was pleased. He “expects a
good future from them.” '

According to Dieffenbach, West
Virginia has a great team.

-3 iWomen Spikers Do Well   

By SCOTT STONE

A Last week Shelton Collier, coach

of the Pitt women’s volleyball
team, said he was “putting his cards
on the table,” and this week he

raked in the chips. At the fourth an- *
nual Pitt Invitational at Trees Hall,.

the Pantherettes finished third out
of afield of'2O teams. '

“We were in with the top teams ’

of our division,” Collier said, “and
we wanted to prove right off the bat
that we were the number one team

in the East.”

Pitt beat Georgetown in their
opening match 2-0 and advanced,
undefeated, to the semi—finals to
face Michigan State University.

“Our letdown came in the semi’s
against Mic11igan,”\ Collier said.
Frankly’, we lost because they

weren’t one of our east coast‘

rivals.” ‘ r .
M.S.U. beat Pitt two games to
one and went on to win the tourna-
ment in the final round against Nor-
thern Kentucky. _
“This is really great,” M.S.U.
coach Annelies Knoppers said after

her team’s~victory. “It’s just like we

fini d a marathon.” _ T

Indeed, the two-day event was as
much a test of endurance as it was
of power and skill. The tournament
was set up so that Bitt could butt
heads with its powerful. Eastern
competition. Pitt played against
Georgetown, ‘ Western Michigan,
Rutgers, and Penn State before the
first playoff round on Saturday.

“Fatigue was a factor with our
team,” Collier said, “but I think
it’s good for‘ the teain to play all day.
against top competition.’ ’

An unexpected development was ..

the" Cinderella-like emergence of

Northern Kentucky from the pack.
After an opening match loss to
M.S.U., Northern Kentucky came
back to beat" Cleveland State,
Rutgers, and Western Michigan,
and to land a spot in the final
round. '

.“They’re definitely the surprize
of this tournament,” Collier said.
“They upset team after team, and
last year they didn’t even qualify
out of their division.”

“We tried to stay consistant,”

Coach Scheper said of her unlikely-

contenders. “After the first match
loss to M.S.U., it was terrible. We
worked 10 hours a week and we just
didn’t play, so we went to the
sidelines and talked about con-
fidence, and after that we came
together as a team.”

For the Pantherettes, the second
game against M.S.U. in the semi-

’ finals _was a grueling encounter.
‘ That contest involved longvolleys,

penalities,’ and numerous ball

: changes without point scores. The
true story of that game is not re-'

vealed in the final count of '15-7,
M.S.U. ' A -

“They’re an experienced team, a
smart team. They don’t have any
tall girls to slow them down,” Col-
lier said. “We made a lot of smart
moves, played a strong defense; we
just came up short.”

Forthe Pantherettes, the loss to [H
M.S.U. marks the first in 15 mat- .

ches this season.‘ Overall, Coach
Collier was" satisfied with his
squad’s performance. _

“We defeated Georgetown, we
defeated Rutgers and Penn State,”
Collier said. “Of course we wanted
to win our own tournament, but
our primary objective was to defeat
the major teams in the East", and, in

the end, we definitely were the team A ‘

to beat in the East.

“In an event this long, where
everyone has come together to con-
tribute, it’s tough to single out any
individuals.‘ for praise,” Collier
said, “but I can’t overlook the com-
bination performances ‘of Maria
Perez, setter, and Linda Stadler,
spiker.”

Stadler, an impressive front-line,

person and according to Collier,
one of the most powerful players in
the East, is troubled with chronic
tendonitis.

"‘It’s one of those things you "

have to get used to,’-” Collier said.
“She has learned to play with
pain.” ‘ '

Collier was impressed with: his
team’s comeback power, as seen in
three comeback wins in tte early

"matches.

“We’ve come back to fight hard

in all of them,” said the Pantherette ‘

coach. “It’s very encouraging to see
that we’ve got so much"-fight and
life this early in the season.”

In preparation for next week’s 3

tournament at Temple, Collier is
concentrating on developing his
team’s overall defense. -
