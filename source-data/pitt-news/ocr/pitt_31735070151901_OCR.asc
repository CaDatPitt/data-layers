At Pitt’s Greensburg, Pa., cam-
pus, a group of students packs
into a coffeehouse each fall to
vie for the most sexual, violent
or cute literary reading.

In a “banned books” contest,
students can join the Sigma Tau
Delta honors society for readings
judged upon shock value, literary
merit and reading performance.

Eric Carle’s “The Very Hun-

gry Caterpillar,” the Bible’s “Song '

of Solomon” and Henry Miller’s

“Tropic of Capricorn” are among

popular titles. .
Jessica Craig, a sophomore

majoring in English writing and
microbiology, has spearheaded
efforts to bring Sigma Tau Delta
— an international English hon-
or society — to Pitt’s Oakland
campus. The society was founded
in 1924 at Dakota Wesleyan Uni-
versity, according to its website,

and has since established more -

than 850 chapters worldwide.

for the Pitt— Greensburg chapter,
which manifested in the early-

Snow may be pretty, but for resi-
dents of South Oakland, it can
also pose a serious threat.

With the recent arctic blast

blanketing Oakland with snow?

fall, proper removal of the ﬂuffy
stuff is a pressing concern for

 

those who must navigate the
roads and sidewalks of Oakland.

V By law, the resident or business

owner of a property next to a
sidewalk is responsiblefor re-
moving the snow on that portion
of the sidewalk.

But as Pitt becomes a bigger
part of the'Oakland community,
it becomes diﬂicult to tell who’s

area that technically belongs to the city.

Cara Masset, director of University
news, said University policy mandates
snow removal only on sidewalks adjacent
to property owned by Pitt.

“Pitt does an excellent job of removing .

snow on its properties,” Masset said. “We
clean the sidewalks on Joncaire until we

reach the point where Pitt no longer owns V

the property.” A —
Paul Supowitz, Pitt’s vice chancellor for
community and governmental relations-,

"said the conﬂict over plowing Joncaire

Street has been an issue for many years.
Supowitz said that although the University
wants to be helpful, it is the city’s respon-
sibility to clean its property.

Supowitz said the area around the
intersection of Joncaire and Boundary
streets is “a little off the beaten track for

the city,” but that the city must take care
of it. _

“The city needs to put this area on its
back,” Supowitz said. ‘ V

He also pointed to areas near Phipps
Conservatory and Schenley Park, city
propertynear Pitt’s campus where the
city clears the sidewalks. A

Kevin Kerr, Councilman Bruce Kraus’
community relations manager, said the
councilman wants students totake action
with problems inthe city and encourages

"students to dial the 311 Response Center:
or contact the councilrnan’s oﬂice directly

to ﬁx problems.

“[_]oncaire and Boundary] streets -are
city streets,” Kerr said. “If those aren’t
being plowed, then it’s the city’s respon-
sibility.” ,

Matt Milana, a Pitt undergraduate and
two—year resident ofjoncaire Street, said
he’s never really noticed a problem with
snow.

Student volunteer efforts contribute to
taking care of the parts of Oaklandthat are p

C beyond the University’s property lines.

o > Reb'ekkah‘Ranallo, communications
manager at Oakland Planning and Devel-
opment Corporation, runs a volunteer
program called Keep It Clean, Oakland!

to give back to the Oakland community.

Ranallo said students from Pitt’s Greek ’
Life, service organizations, and students
who have to complete community service
play a large role in Keep It Clean, Oaklandi, _
which works to clean up the neighborhood
by removing snow, picking up litter and
helping those in need. . ,

“There are some property owners who

   

l

are either disabled or elderly,” Ranallo
said. “Wetry to help out as needed.” _

_ Among the group’s projects is the
“Adopt-a-Lot program,” through which
volunteer groups adopt and take care of
an abandoned lot for a year, Ranallo said.

According’ to Giampolo,' this isn’t

"enough. He started his own community

organization, South Oakland Urban Litter,
and he hopes to convince Pitt to donate $4

, from each undergraduate student’s tuition.
to hire full-time lit:ter—removal workers. .

Giampolo sees a relationship between Oak-
land’s litter problem and its snow removal
problem. . ._ '

Giampolo said in-an email tha-tcity
workers plowed the area onjoncaire Street

, on Wednesday, Jan. 29, and Monday, Feb. 3.

“Things change for two reasons,” said
Giampolo, “tragedy and human dignity.
Let’s not wait for a tragic event to occur
before a permanent solution is made on
this issue._” I '

SOPHILTHY

Post—Super BoWllcritique':‘

‘Commercials

wrongﬁilly ﬁxate on American ideals

Sophia Al Rasheed
‘ ' Columnist

I’m.one‘ of those that only cares
about the Super Bowl for the po-
tential of the Steelers to play, and,
in the event of that not happen-
ing, a chance to over— eat and watch
commercials. - _
To be fair, this habit was set
on a certain precedent that Super
Bowl commercials normally in-
tend to be,well, funny and provide
something about which viewers
can get excited. I’ve developed a
genuine love for commercials, such
as the one-second Miller High Life
commercial of 2008 and the baby-
holding, glory-dad Taco Bell com-
mercials of 2012 because of the
time (and big bucks) that advertis-
ers spent to make us laugh. g
These offered subtle entertain-
ment between the harshness of
football for people like me who,
admittedly, might not understand
everythingthat is going on in the

game. In addition came my tradi-
tion of consistently missing each
~year’s ﬁmniest commercial by an
unfortunately predestined plan of
going to the bathroom at exactly
the wrong time. I’ve secretly loved
everything about this unfortunate
tradition.
I thought my love for Super
Bowl advertisements was embar-
rassing, but I deﬁnitely don’t feel

_ like I should be the embarrassed

one this year. The disappointing

and awkward result of this year’s .

advertisements resulted from a
new tactic of apparently appealing
to American pride and tapping into
sentimentality as ameans to sell
their products. Instead of receiving
multiple examples of the expected
comedic relief, we only received
a select few light-hearted com-
mercials about products such as
Greek yogurt and the subtle, quiet,
audience-instructing Honda com-
mercial with Bruce Willis and Fred
Armisen. Oh, and if it weren’t for

' the Full House reunion and Ellen
Degeneres’ modern-day-Gold-
ilocks commercial, we wouldn’t
have anything to talk about this

' week. .

Now, I’m all for a little varia-
tion while products and names are

being waved in front of my face; -

Even Ron Swanson would awe at
the Budweiser puppy—and-horse
commercial. But spending the
majority of the air time making
sure that America feels patriotic is
a Super Bowl advertisement char-
acteristic that I haven’t witnessed
before. And when you think about
what the American pride is actu-
ally representing (selling you on a
product), it comes to little surprise
that the outcome wasn’t exactly
pleasant, and created more harm
than good.

For one thing, it left many
viewers with the weird contrast
of weighing out American pride

Al Rasheed D 4

AL RASHEED

against a disinterest in a certain website, or
a deﬁnite appreciation of peace over conﬂict
with a complete disdain for Axe deodorant.
We couldn’t outright say that we hate a cer~
tain commercial because it would, to some,
imply that we hate these sentimental ideals.

But if you want a much more obvious
indication that these commercials didn’t

execute a smooth strategy, you‘ can read the ‘
outrage over some of these commercials, _

February 4, 2014 I The Pitt News | vwwv.pitlnevvs.Com

such as this year’s Coca-Cola commercial in

which “America the Beautiful” was sung in '

a variety of languages. If you look at «Twit-
ter posts in response to the commercial, _it

"would appear Coca-Cola lost some pretty '

racist consumers atthe expense of its thirst
for sentimentality. Although it’s incredibly
disappointing to witness anyone in 2014
-display these reactions, you can’t expect
to mix something as ﬂat as consumerism
and as complicated as a sense of American
identity and not stir up conﬂict.’ '~
The thing is, American pride isn’t some

thing you should forcetdown people_’s throats
like the appealof a new twist—off cap of a
beer, and it deﬁnitely shouldn’t be used as
a tactic to sell. These emotions that adver-
tisements are trying to tap into are created
through personal experience, not within

A the aisles of ayconveniehce store. to V
' * 5 Although on the surface it seems like we
should support the advocation of a racially A’

diverse, peace-promoting, worker-driven.

America, it’s important to remember that do

these agendas are directed by a team of

advertisers whose main goal is to appeal to

you as a consumer, and not your American

pride. Essentially, they’re trying to sell you‘ A

a product, no matter liovirpeace-_loving or
appreciative of different races you are, Hu-
mor is accepted as a digniﬁed way (if there
is one) of doing this because. it’s understood
as a neutral, innocent mediumfto appeal
to viewers. 7 l I V . V ' ~
Sentimental -commercialsthat rely on

, genuine feelings don’t quite have thatjusti— ‘

ﬁcation. Hopeﬁilly next year’s commercials
get the memo. _I_ . E g A  '- "

‘Heads’ takes poignant lookat wartime imprisonment

Gideon Bradshaw
Senz'0r_St4ff W riter

Warzones and prisons may be Americans’
favorite places; In the popular imagination,
both represent Hobbesian settings where
life is “nasty, brutish and short”«as charac-
ters blur pre—existing lines of social class
in the immediacy of their ﬁght for survival.

E.M. Lewis’ “Heads,” directed by john
Shepard and running at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse through Feb. 16, uses these
two compelling settings to create a play
that combines the chaos of war with the
isolation of imprisonment. In the play, four
Westerners 4- three Americans and one
Brit —— ﬁnd themselves kidnapped by ter-
rorists in Iraq in March 2004, a year after

the U.S.-led invasion.

While the play is a drama about people’
who find themselves stuck together, Lewis
and Shepard also try to show the injustice
and frivolity of events in wartime.

Before the lights come on, we hear a re—.

cording of President George W. Bush’s later-
derided “Mission Accomplished” speech
in all its irony, and later in the play, young
Iraqi children appear in a video projected
above the stage.

While these aspects are intended to re-
mind us of the failure of the war’s ostensible
goals and the devastation it inﬂicted on
Iraqi society, Lewis never fully develops
these arguments. Instead, each of the char-
acters — all civilians —- see themselves as
Victims of circumstance who were only in

awarzone to do their jobs.

Instead of trying to answer the question
of who carries ultimate responsibility for
the kidnappings — Bush, the captives or
the terrorists —— the play makes no’argu—
merits about the war and instead portrays
its fundamental injustices. '

The action takes place on two small,

— adjacent stages that simulate two separate,

grimy cells with bare lightbulbs hung over
the actors. The occupants of each cell can’t
communicate with those in the other, even
as they begin to suspect there are other
captives. .

In one cell, Harold Wolfe (James

' FitzGerald), an American engineer who has

adapted to captivity after seven months,
must now adjust to a new cellmate, Caroline

Conway (Diana lift), who is a spokeswoman
for the British embassy.

Wolfe encourages Conway to forget her
old life and simply adapt. Instead, Conway
clings to memories from the world outside,
talking incessantly about how much she
wants a cigarette and singing, then later
shouting frustratedly, the lyrics to “Lucy
in the Sky with Diamonds” by The Beatles.

In the other cell, jack Velazquez (Pat-

V rick Cannon), an impetuous freelance

photographer who claims not to have a
hometown but “sometimes lands in New
York,” and Michael Apres (Tony Bingham),
a buttoned—up news anchor from Hartford,
Conn., ﬁnd themselves stuck together in

just hours before the Super Bowl kickoff
on Sunday, news broke that Hollywood
lost one of its ﬁnest actors — Philip Sey-
mour Hoffman.

The story ﬁrst came to my attention
through a Facebook post that read: “Rest
in peace Philip. You were a great actor.”

Sure, Hoffman was a great actor, but
hardly a member of the A—list. Yet like
so manytalents taken too soon, he post-
humously became the biggest A—list star
— for a few hours. ,

It wouldn’t be much of a gamble to
bet that some of the mournful Tweeters
wouldn’t have recognized Hoffman by
name before his death. Upon browsing
his IMDb page and realizing that,
yes, he was an Oscar-winner
for “Capote” in 2006,

an arrangement reminiscent of “The Odd
Couple.” ‘ , '
The banter and verbal sparring between

. Velazquez and Apres carries the play’s ﬁrst

half. A ‘ — ,

S, . Bingham plays the straight man for
Cannon’s Velazquez, a ﬁgureof explosive
rage and brooding cynicism who prefers

danger and uncertainty to what he sees as.

the mundanity of everyday life.

Velazquez gleefully recites the transla-
tions for “f*ck your mom’?  Vietnamese,
Russian and several other languages, acting
as though his far—ﬂungtravels have done

nothing but give him"-more ammunition with '

which to wallow in the world’s callousness.

When Apres reveals that a beating at -

the hands of his captorsjis the ﬁrst time
he’s suffered in his life, Velazquez cannot
cornmiserate without showing his own ar-
rogance. ~' A S - . — -
“It’s” a rite of passage,” Velazquez says.
“Most of us go through it_when’we’re 9.”
Both men take turns succumbing to rage
against their unseen captors. During these

, moments of panic, the actors give perfor-
mances strong enough to make us squirm at «
being close to such raw displays of emotion; ’

As the resentment between Apres and
Velazquez gives way to a bond over their
shared captivity, this storyline goes from
tense to cliche. Luckily, the relationship
between Conway and Wolfe steals the show
as the storyline between Velazquez and
Apres dulls. ‘ . —

That Wolfeand Conway are a man and
woman forced to live together in close prox-

A imity creates a complex dynamic. They be-

come comfortable enough to revealprivate

details about themselves to one another. In

the play’s most jarring and human moment,
Conway tells Wolfe about the humiliation
she felt when she hadto explain to a teen"-
age male captor that she was menstruating.

It is ultimately Ifft’s performance as
Conway that’ gives the show its emotional
weight. In one convincing moment, Con-
way’s attempts to control herself give way
to exasperation when she admits she isn’t
sure how she feels about her captors, who
now provide her with food and water.

“I want them to come and I don’t want
them to come,” she says when she hears
footsteps outsideher cell. “It is a strange
sort of dependency we have on them.”- I

surprise that the warning signs for Hoff-
man’s recurring struggles with addiction
were softly reported and more likely to ﬂy
under the radar than those of other stars.

In May 2013, news surfaced that Hoff-
man had checked in to a 10-day detox
program after relapsing for more than
a year. He had been sober for 23 years,
but revived the abuse with prescription
pills and eventually heroin. «

It’s a sad reality that the “Philip Sey-

mour Hoffman checks into detox” head-
line will never be as seductive as “Philip
Seymour Hoffman dead at 46.” No matter
how fully-formed an actor’s depression or
troubles are, welike to imrnortalize‘ them
to a point where we won’t try to under-
stand their despair until it’s far too late.

'Drug addiction and perennial rehab

rities that readers can easily shrug off
a “detox” headline as just another part
of the job — standard fare for an actor
‘of his caliber. Unfortunately, maximum

too late. I —

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL’

Dave Uhrmacher
Senior Stqff Writer

Brianna Kiesel placed her hands on her
knees after she had been called for a per-
sonal foul late in the fourth -quarter’ of
the Pitt women’s basketball game Mon-
day night. She looked down, closed her
eyes and shook her head in frustration.

The moment captured the night for
the junior guard and her teammates,
as Pitt (10-12, 2-6 ACC) fell to Geor-
gia Tech, 77-66, in Atlantic Coast Con-
ference action at the Petersen Events
Center. "

“I think it is frustrating for us to
lose,” senior guard Marquel Davis said.
“In order to win, everyone has to con-
tribute. We aren’t a one-person team
where one person is going to go out and
it is going to be a win for us. I think all
of us have to have somewhat of a good
game in order to get the ‘W.”’ D

ﬁnished with a pedestrian performance,
scoring 11 points as she shot 2-of-10
from the floor, while fellow backcourt
member Davis led the way in scoring
with 20 points. '

Davis was the lone bright spot in the
game for the Panthers, converting eight
of her 13 ﬁeld-goal attempts en route to
a season-high scoringloutput.

“Coach [Suzie McConnell-Sergio] told I

me this was a game where I could get to
the basket,” Davis said. “I just took the
confidence she had in me and told my-
self to penetrate and ﬁnd the bucket.”

The first half provided plenty of
back-and-forth action, as Pitt managed
to keep the score relatively close for the
first 15 minutes.

Yellow Jackets’ size  
advantage costly for Pitt

Dan Sostek
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

The Pitt women’s basketball team’s season
took a dramatic turn on Dec. 16, 2013.
The Panthers were 7-4 at that point and
were coming off a 63-49 victory over Old
Dominion the night before. Then it was
announced that redshirt freshman center
Marvadene “Bubbles” Anderson tore her
ACL and would miss the remainder of
the season. »
Anderson was having a solid statistical
season. Thejamaican-born center out of
Rutgers Prep in Newjersey was averaging
a respectable 7.8 points and 4 rebounds
per game in her ﬁrst season of Division I

basketball. But it wasn’t those statistics
that the Panthers would miss most — it
was her height. When 6-foot—11 Anderson,
the tallest woman in Division I women’s
basketball, went down, the Panthers lost
their biggest presence in the post.

That lack of height was on full display
Monday night. The Panthers —- whose
tallest player without Anderson, reserve
player Chyna Golden, stands at just 6-foot-
2 — lost to the Georgia Tech YellowJack—
ets 77-66 at the Petersen Events Center.

Pitt once again trotted out a lineup
of four guards and one forward, start-
ing with Loliya Briggs, Brianna Kiesel,

Marquel Davis, Ashlee Anderson and Asia
Logan, who is tallest of the bunch at six
feet. Compare that to the three of Georgia
Tech’s ﬁve starters who are taller than
six feet, and it’s a little easier to fathom
the fact that the Panthers surrendered 42
points in the paint.

Pitt head‘ coach Suzie McConnell-Serio
understands that her team is lacking in

-the height department.

“Once we lost Bubbles, we just became
so small inside,” McConell-Serio said. “We
realize that. But that’s why we need to be
more efﬁcient offensively.”

The Panthers were anything but effi-
cient on offense Monday, shooting 22-for-
68 from the ﬁeld -—- a 32 percent shooting
percentage -— while making only ﬁve of
20 3_-point attempts.

Davis, a senior guard who scored a
team-high 20 points, didn’t want to use
the Panthers’ small lineup as an excuse.

“I think we’ve adjusted [to the loss
of Anderson] ,” said Davis, who also had
seven rebounds, ﬁve assists, three blocks
and two steals. “Having a paint presence
makes players kind of sit inside and opens
things upfor the guards. But we’ve had

games without Bubbles where the guards
have been open to shoot. We just have to
be more consistent.”

McConnell-Serio was impressed by the
Yellow Jackets offensively, particularly
with their ability to drive to the basket.

“When they go inside, they do a lot of
speed cuts,” she said, talkingabout the
Yellowjackets’ offense. “We didn’t defend
that well. We were just late.”

The weapons McConnell-Seriowas
referring to were Georgia Tech’s senior
guard Tyaunna Marshall, freshman for-
ward Kaela Davis and sophomore guard
Aaliyah Whiteside. The three of them
scored 23, 16 and 18 points, respectively,
with a good majority of those coming from
either the aforementioned speed cuts or

. free throws resulting from fouls on drives.

Despite the size differential and the
Yellowjackets’ 46-39 rebounding advan-
tage, the Panthers did manage to tally
more offensive boards (a margin of 13
to 10). Part of that is because Pitt simply
missed more often than Georgia Tech did,
but some of it might also be attributed
to the Panthers’ effort, something that
McConnell-Serio lauded after the game.

“Our players continued to ﬁght,” said
McConnell-Serio. “They continued to at-
tack.” I
