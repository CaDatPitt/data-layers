0 SGB Assumes Politicking Activities

9

By DEANNA LOUISE

Politicking will be part of Student
Government’s regimen this year,

Student Government Board (SGB) ,

President Bernie Payne said
yesterday.

“We don’t, live in a vacuum,”
Payne said after the board openly
assailed J.P. Stevens textile
‘manufacturers for illegal labor
practices earlier this week.

The board's decision to lobby on
political controversies deviates

The Allocations Committee began spring hearings this week for appeals to

from the priorities of last year’s
government, which was solely
campus-oriented.

.“J.P. Stevens is receiving
nationwide attention,” Payne said.
“lt’s of concern to students and
important to them.”

The Student Government Re-
search Committee will randomly
phone residents to gather a
consensus, Payne said, before SGB
advocates a cause,iincluding an
opinion on the Yusef Ali case
against Pitt.

their recommended distribution of the student activities fee among recognized

~campus organizations.

House Leaders Hint

HARRISBURG -— Democratic
leader K. Leroy Irvis was elected
House Speaker without opposition
Monday to succeed Herbert Fine-
man who resigned in controversy.

Rep. James Manderino, a
Democrat from Westmoreland
County was elected as majority
leader to replace Irvis yesterday.
Manderino’s victory gives western
Pennsylvania the two top leadership
spots in the House.

Irvis, a 57 year old legislator from
Pittsburgh, became the first black
man to take the top House position
in state history-.

He had been rumored as the
logical choice since Fineman
announced his resignation Satur-
day, the day afterhe was convicted
of obstructing justice in the alleged
influence peddling in medical
school admission cases.

In their first days as the men who
inﬂuence what legislation is voted
on, Manderino and Irvis hinted at a
possible tax hike to balance the

... budget.

“We think additional revenues
will be necessary this year if we are
going to fund what we consider an
adequate budget," the Monesson
native Manderino said.

Asked if he was leaning toward an
increase in the two percent income
tax, Manderino said, “I can’t tell
you that anyone is leaning in any
direction at this time. We are
preparing alternatives is additional
revenues are necessary. ”

Last week, Englehart, the
chairman of the Democratic caucus,
said House leaders were seriously
considering raising the income tax
to 2.3 percent.

Governor Shapp has proposed
balancing the budget by raising the
state sales tax from the present six
percent to seven percent.

Manderino, 45, is inhis 11th year
in the House. He rose to
prominence in 1974 as a member of
a Republican-dominated committee
whose investigation of kickbacks

Ali is appealing the non-renewal
of his three-year contract with the
black studies department.

The SGB did not take a stance on
the similar case of Marxist Paul
Nyden, whose contract was recently
extended after a year-long battle
with Pitt, because “no one
approached us about it,” Payne
said.

The committee researches issues ,

at the students’- request, he
explained.

In the case of Ali, the Black
Action Society, Ali himself and
independent student groups ap-
pealed for an SGB stance.

“We’re having some problems
gathering information from both
sides because the University is
reluctant to talk about the case in
progress,” Payne said.

He gave no hint of the
forthcoming decision, but said it
could be expected by next Tuesday.

“This practice is placed in the
realm of priority, ’ ’ Payne said of the
politicking. “It’s not top priority.”

The Pittsburgh Heinz Endow-
ment has awarded the University a

five-year, $1-million grant to’

establish a nutrition center.
The Heinz Nutrition Center will

provide research, clinical educa-

tion, and patient care facilities.

Tax H: ke

from state contracts was viewed as
an attack on Shapp.

Manderino served as the Demo-
cratic spokesman in defense of
Shapp during the committee’s
hearings.

In addition, courses at undergrad-
uate, /professional -and continuing
education , levels for physicians,
nurses, dieticians and other health
professionals will be integrated
with the center.

The nutrition programs at
Pennsylvania State University, and

the Thomas Jefferson Medical‘

College, Philadelphia, which are
also supported by the ‘Heinz
Endowment through the Nutrition
Foundation, Inc., will coordinate
the center's development.

The center will include three
interlocking programs: fundamen-
tal nutritional research, clinical
nutrition, and applied nutrition,
which focuses on education and
community service.

UN Guests
To Visit
University

A United Nations delegation will
be received here by Chancellor.
Wesley Posvar on June 12,- kicking
off a one-day visit to Pennsylvania
by the assembly’s permanent
representatives.

The trip, the second annual visit
to a U.S. state for the foreign
dignataries, is part of a program
designed to increase public
knowledge of the U.N. It also gives
therepresentatives reciprocal un-
derstanding of the United States.

Squads of city and campus police
will provide security for the
delegates. Each ambassador also
will be assigned a Pennsylvania
National Guard escort, who will
remain with him all day. _

Secretary General Kurt Wald-
heim will accompany the group,
which will be greeted early that
Sunday at Greater Pittsburgh
International Airport by several
state political notables, including
Governor Milton Shapp, Pittsburgh
Mayor Richard Caliguiri and Edgar

B. Speer, chairman of the board of

directors of U.S. Steel.

After their arrival in Oakland,
the group will tour the Nationality
Rooms, then proceedto Carnegie
Institute for a convocation cere-
mony in the music hall, which will
include Secretary of ‘State Cyrus
Vance. V I

Following an address by Wald-
heim, Posvar will present him-with
the George C. Marshall Peace
Award. ' -

Included in the day’s activities
will be: a luncheon with Pittsburgh
business leaders in the Carnegie
Institute Art Museum; and a
baseball doubleheader at Three
Rivers Stadium.

Sailing Off Course

After fighting long odds and enormous apathy in establishing a
student group assembly that just might work, and making good use
of summer activity fee funds at the noon cafes, the Student Gover-
nment Board seemed to be sailing.

But now, Bernie Payne’s Board has set a course that is at best
dangerous. Recently, there has been welcome silence from SGB on
non-campus issues t_hat do not directly affect Pitt students. Now,
however, the current Board appears set on ending that wise
tradition of using its resources on campus, where they can be best

i used. Its decision to take stands on issues" such as the case of J. P.

Stevens and Yusef Ali is not a good one. ,
_ There are several reasons the Board should not let its attention
wander past Pitt. It is doubtful SGB has the resources to

thoroughly research the causes it is aboout to embrace. ‘And if it.

does, these resources—often subsidized by the activities
fee—-should be used to make Pitt’s student voice heard, in matters
that affect them. . I g
' Also, it is doubtful these statements by SGB will be heeded by
anyone in a position to change things. SGB has enough trouble get-
ting students to listen, even when it’s for their own good. Anyone
who believes J. P. Stevens is waiting for word from the Student
Union is mistaken. g
And finally, there is the question of what SGB’s stance will
mean. Will it be a definitive gauge of Pitt student opinion?
Probably not, since few students are on campus with any frequency
and, more important, fewer care about these issues. SGB positions
on campus issues are valuable because, in most cases, the students’
logical choice is clear—cut and SGB advances that alternative.
But this is not the case with political issues such as the ter-
mination of Ali’s contract. Clearly, SGB shouldnot worry about
national health insurance, abortion and the defense budget when its

time would more wisely be spent working on lower tuition and in-

creased student services. kernie Payne’s Board should change
course now, before it gets i_n over its ihead.

A lustifiable Expense

In these days of tuition increases and academic cutbacks, it’s
I especially nice‘ to learn of an administrative move. that leads us to
believe they’re human over there, after all. .
Sorecent reports from Vice Chancellor for Business and Finance
Joe Dutton’s office that pm has launched a continuing plan of in-
vestment in an effort to make areas of the campus more accessible
to handicapped students and visitors are good news, indeed. A
common-sense approach laced with compassion is what was needed
and, apparently, that’s what was used. '

Recycling. . .the Solution to University Waste

As you finish a can of sugary
ﬂuid and toss it into a waste bin
(presuming you are at least a
superﬁcially litter conscious per-
son) do you ever wonder where the
can goes; how many beverage
containers are sold and disposed of
on campus each year; how much
waste in general is generated at
Pitt?

The answers to these questions
are rather shocking and emphasize
the ﬂagrant disregard for conserva-
tion and environmental problems at
this university.
generates approximately 36 thou-
sand cubic yards of solid waste.

Included in thissfigure are three 7

quarters of a million bimetallic
beverage containers. The univers-
ity pays about $79,200 each year to
have all of this intrinsically

valuable stuff hauled off to the:

Carnegie dump several times a

week. Our gargantuan consuming ’

and waste producing entity is doing
very little to change this situation.
None of the approximately 5,200

Atom Advocate Appeared Arrogant

John P/relich’s letter to the Pitt
News (“Nuclear Power is Safe
Power,” 5/19/77, p. S) betrays a
lack of thought and incredible
arrogance. Mr. Prelich correctly
worries. about the pollution from
coal and oil burning plants and then
proceeds to compare that to the
short-term pollution from nuclear
power plants when operating
normally. The comparison is silly.

~ The worry is not about short-term.

emissions under normal operating
conditions. The problem is first that
nuclear power plants do not always
operate normally and in many

instances have exceeded .‘ ‘normal’ ’
emissions, and second that over the
long run there is no way currently
known from preventing enormous
quantities of radioactivity from
entering the environment. There is
simply no place to put the waste
products from nuclear reactors.

Plutonium and other by-products of
fission reactors (both breeder

reactors and “conventional” light‘

distruction of the genetic code and
thus the basis for the continuation of
life itself. .

Mr. Prelich’s arrogance is as
great as his ignorance. He claims
that the environmentalists are
“almost invariably people of no
scientific background.” On the
contrary, the anti-nuclear move-
ment has been led by the Union of
Concerned Scientists headed by a
professor of physics from Berkeley
and another from M.I.T. I have lost
count of the number of Nobel

Laureates who have publicly.

called for a halt to the building of
nuclear power plants. The local
branch of Friends of the Earth,
which Mr. Prelich criticizes and to
which I belong, has as its
chairperson a computer analyst and
as its chairperson for energy a
nuclear physicist.

But that is beside the point. A
French premier once said that war is

‘too important to be left to the

generals. Pollution from nuclear
power is too important to leave to
physicists. This is a democracy in
which the people, not the politicans
or the experts, must ultimately
decide.

Mike and Harry Habbel:
Pitt ’s Twin Brother A at

By TOM FISHER

Mike and Harry Habbel, the recently graduated twin brother
members of the Pitt Panther’s tennis team for the last four years,
reflected on their background, tennis and its part in their lives, four
years at Pitt, future plans and their close relationship.

Mike and Harry started playing tennis in seventh grade. Their
mother saw a newspaper ad which offered free tennis lessons in a local
summer tennis league, and it wasn’t long before they started to show
their skills.

At Williamsport Area High School, Harry, on the tennis team for
four years, lettered his last three, while.Mike Habbel, a member for
three years, lettered all three.

The Habbel’s were, not just interestedin tennis, however. Mike
played baseball and was an intermediate league all-star. He wanted to
continue playing baseball.in high school, but no.team existed.

In the end, tennis appealed to
each brother but for different
reasons. “I liked the one-on-one

With the loss of many individuals .

throughout the season, it will be
impossible for Pitt to take the team

championship, which will probably
be contested between powerhouses
Michigan and Penn State. If the

Panthers placed in the top five, it
would be considered a job well
done.

The limited Pitt crew competing
in the two-day meet includes Willie
Walker, Larry Shippen, Keith

Leckenby and Kevin Carpenter in
both the 400- and 1600-meter
relays (Carpenter and Walker will

also be running in the open
200-meter dash); Bud Cooper and
Wayne Hursen in the 400-meter
run; Dan Dattilo and Rich Moore in
the 800-meter run; Tom Herrmann
and Gary Siriano in the 1500-meter
run; and Boyd, Nort McDonald and
Mark Studnicki in the 5000-meter
run. The field events will feature

Maydak in the long and triple
jumps; Keith, Taylor in the triple
jump; and Taylor and Goodyear in

competition,” Mike said. “In
tennis singles, I won because I was
better than my opponent. I was in
control of the game. In team sports
like baseball, there was nothing that
Icould do in the event of a loss even
though I might have had a good
game.”

“I could play singles and doubles

opportunity for Mike and me to play
doubles.” O

Although tennis can become a
time-consuming sport, Mike and
Harry benefitted by playing for Pitt.

Mike, who was team MVP. in his

sophomore year, explained, “Be-
cause of tennis and schoolwork, my
time had to be more organized. I.
became‘ mentally prepared for
studying and the increased pres-
sure of competition. I also improved
my volley game.” _
_ -“I gained a lot of confidence in
myself and learned a great deal
about the mechanics of the game,”
said Harry, who was team MVP in
his junior year. “I never expected
to reach the level of success that I
did.”

One reason the Habbel brothers
reached the level of success they did
was because of a strong personal
relationship between each other.

“One thing that helped us was
that we roomed together at Pitt for
the first three years,” Mike said.
“We did not have the added
pressure of adjusting to new
roommates. We were very close
and helped each other in adjust-
ing.”

As for the future, Harry is trying
to get into medical school (he
graduated with a degree in
biochemistry and a 3.4 Q.P.A.). He
is also considering entering dental
school and graduate school as he is
interested in hospital administra- .
tion.

Mike’s future plans include
enrolling at Pitt to study for a
master’s in mechanical engineering
(he graduated with a degree in
mechanical engineering and a 3.6
Q.P.A.) and eventually seeking a
job in industry.

Their feelings about their Pitt
playing days are easily summed up.

‘‘I improved a lot personally,”
Mike said. “I enjoyed it a lot and
have no regrets at all."

‘‘I love the school,” Harry
commented. “I want people that
knew me as a tennis player at Pitt to
know me as a winner.”

Purple Remains Hit
Skids In “Malice”

(Continued from Page 5)
late Tommy Bolin, and then
collapsed under the weight of bad
press and little fan interest.

The two who stuck out Deep
eight year existence.
drummer Ian Paice and keyboardist
Jon Lord formed a band with
ex-Family vocalist keyboardist
Tony Ashton.

Called PAL (initials of the three
men's last names)’ they have
released an album, “Malice in
Wonderland,” that——sorry to say-
is an embarrassment to all
concerned.

The album’s style is totally
different from Deep Purple’s, with
synthesizers and organs as lead
instruments and emphasis on funky
drumming.

The problem is, no one in the
group can sing. In addition the’
songs are downright stupid dealing
with booze-topics like getting

drunk on the road, seeing ghost
while drunk and leaving your girl

_ while drunk.

Paiceand Lord were not Deep
Purple’s key songwriters. On Deep
Purple’s album, the entire band
was given credit for writing the
songs. However, Blackmore
mainly was responsible for the
band’s themes and instrumenta-
tion. On “Malice in Wonderland”

‘this weakness shows.

The album‘s sound is good but
not exciting.

Deep Purple was a superstar
band. Blackmore was the leader
but Paice and Lord, along with the
two _sets of lead vocalists and
bassists, Ian Gillian and Roger
Glover from the Machine Head
days, and later David Coverdale
and Glenn Hughes from the Burn
and Stormbringer periods, com-
bined to make a very entertaining

Soaped Up “Plaza Suite” Not Up To Par

Plaza Suite
Directed by Harvey Medlinsky
Heinz Hall

By DAN KACZMARSKI

The program for “Plaza Suite”
describes the play as “a riot of
laughter from start to ﬁnish.”

Subtracting 50 percent of that

«statement’s hyperbole leaves one

closer to the truth.

The Neil Simon creation, offered
at Heinz Hall through Saturday as
part of the Broadway Theatre
Series, is undeniably funny. Long
on wit and urbanity, it certainly
beats sitting at home ingesting
three hours of crime ﬁghting, Kojak .

e » style.

However, Heinz Hall’s produc-
tion, directed by Harvey Medlinsky,
could use improvement.

“Plaza Suite” is a trio of short
plays, set in Suite 719 of New York’s
Plaza Hotel. The unchanging
scenery and the theme-——contem-
porary marriage at its worse—unify
the mini-comidies.

The production’s comedic tone
changes with each piece.

Simon’s view of life progressively
lightens, from the sobering opening
portrait of a deteriorating marriage,
through a pleasantly naughty tale of
extramarital activity and ending
with a farcical look at a feisty couple
hysterically trying to talk their
bride-to-be daughter out of a locked
bathroom.

Though the curtain closer is

replete with slapstick and visual

humor, the forte of “Plaza Suite” is

incontestably its dialogue.

Simon’s script is hilarious on
paper. There is enough hardy
humor present to survive even the
most blatant misreading, and the
cast is far from amateur.

In an apparent play for the
daytime television audience, the
producers ﬁlled the roles with soap
opera favorites. Somebody must be
watching those much-miligned
serials, for each character was

greeted with a round of applause as
he/ she appeared on stage.

Jeanne Cooper is outstanding in
her portrayal of Norma Hubley, the
beleaguered mother of the bride.
Also notable are Tom Hallick and
Janice Lynde as the reunited
teen-age sweethearts.

Though John Lupton and Jim
Sikking are spirited in the roles of
Sam Nash and Roy Hubley, they
have the disadvantage of being

young men cast as gruff 50-year-
olds, a disconcerting hindrance to
their believability.

Emily McLaughlin portrays Kar-
en Nash, a 48-year-old woman with
stars in her eyes and feet on the
brink of marital tragedy. Her role is

A probably the most fully drawn of all.

Rounding out the cast are Barrett
Nolan and Toni Berrill in minor
roles.

Though the players made the

sary—-it was.

most of Simon’s script, they
mishandled a number of lines
through poor enunciation. Several
microphones, hidden among the
props, apparently led the actors to
believe projection was not neces-

In general, though, anyone
familiar with the playwright’s work
and expecting an entertaining,
acerbic look at contemporary foibles
will not be disappointed.
