News Guns For Ayes, Nays
On Tri-Cornered Oratory

Long, Johnson, Coughlin Triumvirate Scored As Fracas,
Circus, Personal Exploitation, Revival Of 7 _0’s

 

By Charles Lipanovich

Soldier, priest, senator-—-all three
national ﬁgures—are now engaged in
the alleged greatest political contro-
versy since Lincoln and Douglas lock-
ed horns on the slavery question.

General Hugh S. Johnson, militant,
bombastic, ex-soldier, ex-“cracker
downer" of the NRA; Father Charles
E. Coughlin, Detroit’s oratorical Ro-
man Catholic prlest; and Senator
Huey P. Long, self-styled “dictator”
of the state of Louisiana, -have been
at it hammer and tongs over the ra-
dio for the past two weeks.

The Pitt News has interviewed
members of the faculty and student
body in an effort to obtain _a cross

section of campus opinion in regard’
to the merits of these men, who are‘

among the nation’s leading political
ﬁgures. They were asked the follow-
ing question: “What is your opinion

‘ of the Long-Coughlin-Johnson politic-

al controversy?

“All -three are mountebanks,”
said Dr‘. John M. Ferguson, assist-
ant professor o.f economics. “All of
them have their good and bad side,
but all three seem to b_e in favor._of
personal exploitlation." ‘

Leonard iMarks, president of SFA
said, ' ' “ ‘

“One vital service of this tri-cor-
nered debate is undoubtedly to

bring forth into theﬁopen many of‘

the controversial issues of the New
Deal. It is serving an admirable
purpose in interesting the public in
political affairs.”

Lois Milliken, vice president of
Panliellenic Council declared.

‘‘,I think the Long-Coughlin-Johm
son fracas is the best -thing for
‘the newspapers since the Lindbergh
baby was kidnapped. I am glad
there are three of them, .it makes

Sward Analyzes

, Jewish Patterns,

POW Psychologist Asserts Race
Shows ‘ 9 Anxiety Neurosis’ ’~

An analysis of “Jewish patterlls Of
temperament” was presented before
the psychology forum Monday after-
noon by Dr. Keith Sward, professor
of psychology at Pennsylvania Col-
lege for Vvomen.

According to Dr. Sward the Jewish
temper displays “an -inferiority atti-
tude or a mass anxiety nuerosis”
looked for in a people so long sub-
jected to race conflict.

Jewish individuals, he ﬁnds, mani-
fest this tendency in behavior char-
acterized by gregariousness, humility,
aggressiveness and emotional in-
stability. Such behavior is analogous
t.o the behavior of thwarted children.
There is no evidence that such tenden-
cies :-1:‘e native or genetic in nature;
their origin is rather social, cultural
and psychology.

Dr. Sw;-trd based his conclusions
upon a study of typical samples of
Jewish and non-Jewish “triads,”
(mother, father and son or daughter).
The Jewish subjects were of central
European origin, the gentiles of north-
ern European ancestry.

University students and faculty
ﬁlled the seats and overﬂowed into
the aisles yesterday morning when
“The Human Adventure” spread
from a volcanic mass far into the
third hour. By means of aeroplanes,
electrically-controlled balloons, “re-
lief” maps and the scientific voice of
authority of Charles Breasted, of
the Institute staff, the sec1‘ets of the
four World empires were brought
to light by the archeologists, dust-
ed by innumerable Egyptian work-

DeVitis Speaks

The story of Italian pioneers in
America was told to the Italian club
at its meeting Friday afternoon by M.
A. DeVitis, assistant professor of mod-
ern languages. Italian men, who
though unknown in history books, ﬁg-
ured prominently in the development
of] the country, were recounted in his
ta k.

it so much like a circus."

Commenting on» the matter, Dr.
George K. McC‘abe, assistant profes-
sor of economics, stated:

“Father Coughlin, like William
Jennings Bryan, appeals to the
smalldebtor class. iln a period of
deflation the creditors -have the ad-
vantage while in the boom times
the ‘debtors have :the advantage.

Bryan principles. Huey Long, the
Southern leader, is reviving the free

Personally I suspect Mr.
dandruff."

-Charles Roofnor, a ,freshm'-.1n polit-
ical science major, answered thus:

,“,Personally I think Huey is bril-_
liant in Congress, but a clown in
Louisiana. I don’t believe Father
Coughlin should meddle in politics.
Johnson seems to be willing enough
-to perform his duty, but does he
know his duty?”

Other students who were inter-
viewed were evasive and admitted
that they did not possess much knowl-
edge of the subject. Among these
were -Charles -Foreman, editor of the
Owl, .-president of Pitt Players, mem-
ber of Quill and a -member of Theta
Alpha Phi, whose answer to our ques-
tion was.

Tickets of ‘admission for the second
showing of artistic ﬁlms will be avail-
able to the general student body free
of charge toinorrow in Room .109,
State hall, according to Walter R.-

Hovey, professor and acting head of
the department of ﬁne arts.
Eisenste.in’s “Po_temkin,” Russian
ﬁlm, and Ralph Steiner’s "‘H20,"
American ﬁlm, are the two pictures
produced from an artistic point of
view which are -to be presented by
the department in the Falk Elementary
school auditorium Tuesday evening.

Philip C. Elliott, assistant professor
of ﬁne arts, will give an explanatory
talk of each ﬁlm to introduce the un-
derlying artistic elements._ According
to Mr. Elliott, his talk will consist of
a presentation of the ﬁner points of
the movie, so that students may be
able to compare it better with the
commercial Hollywood product. _

“Steiner's ﬁ.lm., ‘H20,”’ said "Mr.
I-Iovey in discussing the picture, “has
nothing to do with chemistry. It is a.
presentation of the theme of water
from an aesthetic point of view. The
theme is worked out as a background
like a stage setting. A combination
of this point of view and the emo-
tional point of view would ‘be ideal in
any drama. _

“In ‘H20’ the aesthetic theme is
used as a unit‘ throughout the picture.
We see water as‘ the ocean, lake,
river, ﬂood, rain, puddles a.nd streams.
Director Steiner is a master of pho-
tography.” ,

The ﬁne arts department decided to
move the project to the Falk Ele-
mentary school when a huge crowd
had to be turned away from the ﬁrst
showing in Room 817, Cathedral.

Charges Against Youths

Newspaper accounts of the Regional
Youth congress were the most
“blatant” examples of distortion and
misemphasis for circulation purposes
that “I have ever seen,” said T.
Winston Mcconkey, C35, chairman of
the arrangements committee of the
congress.

“The charges that the congress was
dominated by Communists are false,"
he continued. “Not more than one-
tenth of all the delegates at the con-

munistic group. We are not Reds.”

Dr. Craig Praises
Photographic Art

Change To Realistic Type Prints
Noted In Current Exhibition

Those who feel that an artist is to
be co.-iclemned for painting photo-
graphically, should investigate the
current photographic situation.

So says Dr. David R. Craig, head of
the Research Bureau for Retail Train-
ing and vice president of the Pitts-
burgh Salon of Photographic Art that
is open today in the Carnegie Museum
galleries.

“You may discover,” Dr. Craig as-
serted, “that photographers are be-
coming proud '
grapl1ic——and some of them are be-
ginning to criticize the others for
1131118‘ the camera as if it were a ‘brush,
and making photographic prints that
look like paintings.”

In the current salon the change
from the “painting” type prints to the
more realistic forms can be seen.
There are scores of prints of softened
landscapes, snow banks and sand
dunes, but character studies and
human interest bits are playing a more
important part than in any of the pre-
vious exhibits.

Dr. Craig also notes that in the
present show there is “better work-
manship in the presence of better ma-
terials.”

Debater- Writer Banks Discusses Kentucky,
Sales Tax, Women—And All In One Column!

By Edwin P. Banks
KNOXVILLE, Tenn., March 17.——-
Here am I with millions of words to
give away, and the traditional ribbon

of the Men's Debating Association’s
traditional typewriter has virtually
been torn to shreds under the vicious
attack of a debater-—yes, gentleman,
Israel Goldberg, who concluded his

dithvrambic version of the ~verjb_a,l ;a.1_n-;
, muiiition sales of the Merchants of

 

Breath to date.

_ Ribbon or ‘no ribbon, the sobering
inﬂuence of a. political columnist’s

give a proper perspective of this in-
vasion. While I will not -be held ac-

follow, they will follow. After all,
when a Mr. Walker can see Soviet
Russia for 13 days and then expound
author-_itative indictments of the U, 5.

can’t I adopt the same method?

The ﬁrst conclusion, which both of
us errant News men shared, by the
way, is that the movies have engend-
ered false hopes in the idealistic

the “Jumble Dansettes,” which begins
at Heinz House at 5 o'clock with jum-
bled dances and much merrymaking.

Guests will dine and then be feted

After the ﬂoor show, there will be
general dancing to a. Hungarian or-
chestra until 9 o'clock.

Heiuz H.ouse will be dressed with
modernistic decorations of black and
white, paralleling the -motif of the
modern dances. It will be accented

b_v table vases of roses and sweet
peas.
The jumble of dances will be

straightened out by a reader, Agnes
Calabrese, BA35, who will explainrthe
time and circumstance of each dance
on the program. The ﬂoor show will
depict folk .numbers, tap and ballet
numbers, Greek nature, primitive,
Oriental and modern modes of danc-

Beating The Panther
To The Wicket

This is a correction. The small
item on Monday’s second page ad-
vising all graduate students to ﬁle
monthly reports with their major
instructors should have read: “All
graduate students in chemistry.”
The News blames the mistake on
the spring weather, two liuotypers
and a misplaced comma splice.

This is not a correction. An “ear"
in Monday's News screaming: “As
the exhibitors would ballyhoo it:
‘The Human Adventure’—Stupend-
ous! Collossall . etc.” is not,
as ﬁfty million subscribers point out,
a misspelling of colossal. Our ear-
editor used to work in a theater
advertising department, and, so he
says, that's just how the exhibitors
would ballyhoo it.

“Rose Bowl Of Basketball”
Title Awaits Winner
Of Contest

Atlantic City Is Site

Pitt’s basketball season goes
011 and on. By virtue of their
taking the Eastern Intercollegiate
conference title in winning a.
playoff battle with \Vest Virginia,
the Golden Cats automatically

become eligible for a game at At-
lantic City on April 13.
This affair, called the “Rose Bowl

, of Basketball,‘-” will send the Panthers
_ against

the Louisiana State univer-
sity’s cage team. Deﬁnite action as
to whether or not the Cats will play
in the game will not be taken until
the University athletic council meets
and reaches a decision. C. D. VVettach,
council head, is at present conﬁned to
his home because of illness.

Unofficially, however, the Panthers
are as good as at Atlantic City right
now. Before leaving the city early
yesterday for South Bend, Indiana,
Dr. H. C. Carlson, head coach, said
he expectedth-at the Panthers would
play -the post-season game.

IV. Don Harrison, director of ath-
letics,» had not returned from Morgan-
town and could not be reached for a
statement. Harrison had, however,
intimated before the West Virginia
game that in the event of a Pitt win
the Atlantic City offer would ﬁnd

‘ favor with the athletic department.

Despite the fact that they have
played through 24 ball games, and
most of them hard ones, the boys on
the team are more than ready to go
again in the game down East. Ross
Emrick and Pete Noon voiced what is
probably the opinion of the cagers by
saying, “Sure we’ll play. Why not?"

Inasmuch as the loss of time in at-

tending classes, the chief bugaboo of
post-season affairs, is not concerned
in this case, the Cats’ chances of par-
ticipating in the game are virtually
assured.
V Coach Carlson will likely give his
outﬁt a rest for a. week or two before
whipping them into shape for the
Louisiana State tussle.

Fraternity Biiles
Violation Scored

Two Fraternities Reprimanded
For Infraction Of Rules

The fraternity committee, in its
meeting this month, reprimanded one
fraternity for a violation of the rules
of initiation and a member of another
for an alleged infraction of rushing
rules, ac-;‘01‘(ling to the report released
to The News Friday. This commit-
tee is the “high court of appeal" for
all honm-ary professional and social
fraizernities.

The charge against the fraternity,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, was that it had.’
initiated two members without ﬁrst
obtaining certiﬁcation from the ofﬁce
of the dean of men that these pledges
were eligible for initiation. In pass-
ing upon the violation, the committee
ruler “that Sigma Alpha Epsilon fra-
ternity be hereby reprimanded for
violation of -the rules of initiation and
that a different member of this fra-
ternity shall -report each week, that
school is in session, to the secretary
of this committee for a period of one
year."

In a case of an infraction of rush-
ing rules, in which a member of Delta.
Tau Delta was said to have called .3
prospective rushee on the telephone
the evening before the rushing period
began, the committee passed a motion
“that the ofﬁce of the dean of men
reprimand the offending member of
the fraternity and warn him against
future cases of this kind.” A change
in the fraternity rushing rules was
recommended in which the phrase--
“shall approach on fraternity mat-
ters" was deﬁned as including “com-
munication by telephone, telegraph or
by any other direct or indirect
means."

“Nobody Socks Gene Tunney”
OBODY, so the belief goes, socks Gene Tunney
when he walks down the street, because Gene
Tunney is so big and tough that he could knock
anybody silly. Even supermen l-ike Maxie Baer
and Priino Camera and Max Schmeling take one
look at Gene Tunney, and instead of socking him,
they _go home and work-out in the gymnasium.

»Eventually, some day, Maxie Baer might swing at

Mr. Tunney, partly because Mr. Baer is getting
tougher while Mr. Tunney is getting greyer, and
partly because Maxie Baer is that kind of a fellow.

_ But not for a year or two yet; say, ﬁve years.

There will be a war in Europe in a year or two-

say, in ﬁve years, the experts guess —- because

"France has been acting big and tough for so long
that it has caused a lot of suppressions. Countries
like Germany and Austria have had to step into the
gutter about every three weeks partly because
France has been too big to be jostled, and partly
because Germany and Austria have had arrested
development anyway. Meanwhile, though, Ger-
many particularly has been workiiig—oiit in the
gymnasium.

Two months ago, General Jan C. Sniuts, who has
seen more British trenches than most of the gen-
eral staﬁ“, began to be worried about German cal-
isthenics. He suggested “equality of status’.’ for
Germany, along with France and G-reat BI‘1'[-alIl., so
that Germany could walk on the sidewalk too, just
as if Germany hadn’t lost the last war. Moreover,
Lord Allen of Hurtwood-——whose reputation is not
so good as General Smuts’ because of having been
a Ramsey MacDonald socialist in the old days-
interviewed Germans like Adolph Hitler, Goebbels.
von Neurath, and others, and came to the conclu-
sion that:

“Germany accepted temporary inequal-
ity of status. If other countries continue
to inﬂict further. humiliatioiis upon her
new post—war population, which they do
not inflict on any other Great Power, there
will again grow up a warlike spirit, which
will cause her to hurl herself to destruc-
tion for a second time, even though _she
may know that all the odds are against
her.”

This was just like saying that Germany ought
to be invited into the parlor. But the men that
rule in France and England didn’t hear General
Smuts and Lord Allen, and they pretended that
they weren’t getting just a little bit greyer, ‘like
Gene Tunney, possibly. Meanwhile, Adolph Hitler
indicated that he was good and sick of having sup-
pi-essions, and so he called for “military conscrip-
tion,” which is just like saying that he rolled up
his sleeves.

Now nobody doubts anymore that the way to
avoid being socked is to be bigger and tougher
than anybody else, and so France and. England
will do what they can to become even biggerand
tougher than they are already. And Germany will
keep on working-out in the gymnasium. And the
only spot of satisfaction about the whole situation
is, that people like Dean Inge and Sir John Simon,
the foreign minister of Great Britain, who own a
lot of Vickers-Armstroiig munitions stock, will get
bigger dividends.

Louisiana vs. Pitt

OVVN in the caiiebrakes of Louisiana, Huey
Long's greatest—iuiiversity-in-tlie-world pre-
pares to send its championship basketball team
against the champion basketball team of the East-
Following the Pan-
thers’ defeat of VVest Virginia on Monday night,
the Eastern Intercollegiate champions would seem
to be Dr. Carlson’s young men.

This is fortunate for the Atlantic City promoters
of the “Rose Bowl of Basketball,” for a VVest Vir-
ginia team, playing in a post season ‘”Wash Bowl”
football game in the Atlantic City auditorium last
December drew only a few hundred spectators. It
would have been more proﬁtable to race the grey-
hounds as usual that night, or to have leased the
huge auditorium to the Scottish Rite Masons.

With teams like Louisiana and Pitt, however, the

~ Rose Bowl of Basketball (why not simply “The

Salt Cellar?”) should be more successful. "Pitt has
a legitimately great team, having proved that de-
cisively to teams from the seaboard; and Louisiana,
regardless of the quality of its basketball, bears
the colors and reputation of Huey P. Long, a con-
temporary shade of the Rebellion. It hardly seems
necessary to suggest to the promoters that General
Hugh S. Johnson ought to drop in at the half, to
lead cheers for Pitt.

.A SURVEY at a St. Louis college shows that the
average college girl has more spending money
than the average college man. The day the survey
was taken, the average girl had $3.61 in liquid as-
sets, and the average college man had about $2.25.
Strange as it seems, the difference in wealth seem-
ed to puzzle the St. Louis surveyors very much.

If a similar chaniielization of wealth exists at
Pittsburgh, we submit that $3.61 is about the cost

E of a ticket for the Military Ball, on Friday night.

And $2.25 is about the cost of one small orchid.

‘An Indian Legend’
0 r ‘ Po etic

Satire’

 

By Alan C. Lloyd

An Indian sage, though grey with age,

Still ﬁrm, could guide his arrow

With youngster’s strength a meadow length
And sheathe it in a sparrow.

His shoulders straight still bore the weight
Of tribal chieftainship, sir,

His face disclosed what none opposed——

He had a chieftain’s lip, sir!

Throughout the tribe were none to jibe;
They loved his ﬁne appearance.
They criticized but otherwise
They gave him true adherence.

It It I!
And then one day the man of grey
Dismayed, surveyed his village;
The huts he had were not so bad,
But all these huts of tillage

Were much too small for wives and all , '.
The kids, as well as sires, sir, - "
And in and out they pop and shout

Like popcorn in the ﬁre, sir!

It It 0

It happened that the year was fat;

And visitoi-s———it dazed them

To lose their ways in piles of maize-—

The maze of maize amazed them!

They often cussed the shocking dust ,
That made the air unhealthy. _ ‘
And all who came were put to shame

To ﬁnd a tribe so wealthy.

* II t

So when the bowman took the omen

And called the tribe together,

And passed a pipe among his tribe

And let them smoke some heather.

He gained their eyes, Deinosthenized,
And said, well in a word, sir,

That men of dollar thus in squalor
Was nothing but absurd, sir!

As you might guess, they all said yes
When he said, “Build a castle!
Let’s make a tower to show our power,
To educate the vassal!”
it it it
So many years they added tiers
And seldomstopped their helping;
But famine came, and then, for shame,
The cowards started yelping! 9

They hit and tore and barked and swore
“For days they hadn’t eaten!”

And while they rave, alone the brave
Denied that he was beaten.

Beside a wood the old one stood,

The tribe was all about him.

“See yonder deer? I’ll bring him here!"
And all the tribe did doubt him. '

“I’ll make him die before your eye,”
The Indian gruffly stated,

And he was gone, just like a yawn
That you anticipated. 5

Yet ere the day had sluiik away
Their bellies bulged with meat, sir!
The palace side displayed a hide-
The outside was complete, sir!

The hogan rose in sentinel pose,

And wreathed in clouds, was splendid.
And every line showed something ﬁne,
A beauty comprehended.

=l= * it

And then a. cur yelped forth a slur
——The cur was quite amusing-—

He had a knack, as a. matter of fact,

'01’ making things confusing.

The chief perceived the threat conceived,
And threw him from the palace.

And hidden yearners, faithless turners,
Obeyed the words of malice.

The redskin knaves—why call them braves -

At bar-be-cue were playing.

They stopped and hopped and clopped and chopped
The bowman they were slaying.

been appropriately impressed by it. Alas and alack, dis-
illusion, and so forth, they met no stranded actresses,
no beautiful, but independent lieiresses on the Grey-
hound (Tumpson, collect an ad for this), and the sadder,
but wiser Pitties had to be content with raking the ashes
of old love affairs for their mutual diversion,

Shared not only by the itinerant debaters but also by
Governor Earle, is the second conclusion: sales taxes
are vicious. and how. T‘nroughout Ohio and Kentucky,
wherever the needy Merchants lingered to purchase a

pack of cigarettes, a glass of milk, or a Corsage for moth-
er, the robber barons of the state exacted their tribute,
giving us in return the consolation of an interesting
stamp. Only once did they cease from their plundering-
when Goldberg, by this time patiently resigned, asked
them if there was any stamp tax on penny postage
stamps. It makes debaters too class-conscious.

Other observations continue in swift order. Kentucky
scenery from a train is rather flat and dull except for
the ﬂocks of young lambs gamboling as to the tabor's
sound along the blue grass hillsides. Southerners, as
Northern opinion accurately supposes, are leisurely,
easy-going, hard drinking folk. Tennessee is picturesque
if you can dissociate your aesthetic faculties from your
humanitarianism; the country we passed through so far
is rolling with pine tree hills jutting with lime rock
stratiﬁcations, and hundreds of scattered shacks, actual-
ly lived in, splotch the landscape with their gray wrecks.

I will rise nowand go down into the city and seek
refreshments, according to the Gestalt theory. for my
starving soul. ’

 

Modern Economic System
Unable To Care For Society

By Herrymon Maurer

OO MANY students on being graduated from high school see the world

clear, simple, and beautiful in all of its traditionalism. Each part of so-
ciety functions automatically and eﬂiciently; over each division there is a
proper authority who explains away any perplexity. There can be few dis-
turbing thoughts for the student in a. world so ordered. Placidity is inserted
into his mind, inserted by the simple statement, the repetition, the calm
voice of absolute dogmatism.

Since all preventives must be used to discourage those whose youth
might lead them to question the eternal absolutes, the dogma is reenforced
by two myths. The ﬁrst of these makes an appeal primarily to the indi-
vidual. It whispers conﬁdentially in his ear that he need
not worry, that determination alone is prerequisite to
millions, that his own desires are a genuine A1ladin’s
lamp, that they will bring him to the goal that all civ-
ilization considers high and supreme.

Since almost all persons, unless they have concien~-
tiously been brought up to seek their own interests ex-
clusively, cannot help being struck by the inﬂiction of
trouble either upon persons they know or upon large
numbers of the population, there is appended another
myth, the myth of the greatest good for the greatest
number. Let everyone do what he wants and everyone-
or almost everyone——will beneﬁt. Selﬁshness will be
controlled automatically by the beautiful regulating
device of competition.

The student hears this——we have all liea.rd it—at home,
in newspapers, from fellow students, everywhere, and lie is able to enjoy
the same emotional satisfaction as that which he receives when the heroine.
and hero, after suitable vicissitudes, walk forward in the brilliance of the
sunset. But, just as after a while the student begins to doubt the reality of
moving-picture vicissitudes and the truthfulness of happy endings, so he
begins to question the dogma, the dogma which was so conﬁdently fed to
him, the dogma which crumbles at the sight of reality. The discomﬁtures of
the depression increase the number of realities; they grind the dogma. to
powder. A depression deﬂates myths‘ as well as wages.

The wonder is that the myth of ability to get ahead existed as long as it
did. Many years ago when the frontier was still an actuality, when the
country without large corporations was just beginning to produce manufac-
tures it was possible for lucky men to amass fortunes. Today, when cor-
porations are ready and able to pounce upon any proﬁtable manufacture,
there is little chance for an individual, equipped only with determination,
without capital, without connections, to pile up any wealth at all.

Besides, the picture of a government stepping in to try to prop up a
collapsing economic system points quite forcefully the fact that the system
is feeble, that equal opportunity is non-existent. The codes stabilize wages;
they also kill a myth which was intended to pacify the public. The myth is
well dead.

Warped Men

The social approval of meii’s desire to get ahead led, of course, to in-
calculable damage to individual minds. One cannot follow exclusively the
dictates of his own selﬁshness without becoming warped; today weak cari-
catures of men bear witness to the destructive power of socially-approved
greed.

But there is the other myth, the greatest good for the greatest number
story, the story which calmly disregards the fact that the people who need
things most have the least amount of money with which to buy them. Once
the apologist for the present economic system would have suggested that a
person who wants shoes needs only determination, for determination was
once thought to be lawful currency—-—evei'ywhere but over counters and in
business oﬂices. '

Today, however, the apologist would not speak of determination. He
would be laughed down. Not only for five years, but for one hundred the
facts have belied the myth.

Competition was to insure quality, for consumers would buy from the
best manufacturer——but can you tell if silk is weighted?

Competition was to secure proper wages for workers, for they would
work in the factory which paid the highest wages——but when has there been
such a. shortage of labor that a. worker has had his pick! of jobs?

The “King’s Cloa ” Pierced

When the present economic system is viewed without its clothing of
fairy stories, its nature is somewhat unpleasant. One may disregard his-
tories of speciﬁc oppressions, and yet be horriﬁed by statistics of the number
of persons unemployed, of omnipresent separation of income and lowest decent
standard of living. The depression is only an intensiﬁcation of a_ situation
always completely impossible and oppressiiigly actual.

But apologists still announce that all will be well when we emerge from
the depression. Once again we shall go on to new heights, they say. But
the continual difference between wages to labor and the cost of articles pro-
duced shows us plainly that one depression over, we may look forward to
another. The employer who cannot spend all of his moiiey———for one can buy
only so many summer houses and so many shoulders of veal before becom-
ing bored and fat——can only use his money to produce more goods which
labor cannot buy. The articles begin to pile up on storeroom shelves; when
the pile has become too high, it topples. The abstraction which is called the
credit system adds its own overtowering complications to the entanglement
which it underwrites. Small wonder that our economic system ﬂounders
more and more.

The apologist have a. last resort. Confronted with their failure with
theory and statistics, they attempt a. psychological generalization. People
are lazy and ‘-inefﬁcieiit; they want to loaf. What were the loafers doing in
1929, we might ask; why did the epidemic of laziness come upon the liuma.n
race so quickly? But one generalization demands another quite as bold. We
may say to these Cynics who damn all human nature but their own indi-
vidual portions of it, that from our own experience most people are as ready
to work as the traditional cynics are to condemn.

The traditional authorities are dying. Today we seek new ones which
will show us how to repair the damage which the collapse of the old ones
has produced.

Cats Chase Mountaineers
From Conference Honors

 

Panther Five Comes Back Strong In Playoff Battle To
Avenge Last Week’s Morgantown Defeat

Them thar big city fellers ha

(1 a little too much on the ball for

those mighty Mountaineers down at Morgantown. The Mountaineers
were all set to collect more bounties on Panther skins, but the shoot-
in’ irons which had stood them in such good stead only a week ago

went back on them Monday night.

Meanwhile the Panthers of Pitts-

burgh marauded up and down the West Virginia ﬁeld house basket-
ball court and clawed out a 35-22 victory.

It brought the Pitts their third con-9

secutive Eastern Intercollegiate con-
ference cage championship and stamp-
ed them as one of the greatest of all
Pitt “money-teams,” meaning an outﬁt
that can go out and win when the
victory counts most.

Showing a complete reversal of the
rather puny form they exhibited in
last week’s losing battle with the
same Mountaineers, the Panthers
started off with a rush and ran up a
13-4 score on the West Virginians be-
fore the first half closed. During that
time the Mountaineers were held to
one goal from the ﬁeld. Skip Hughes,
Ted Roderick, and Ross Emrick only
had eyes for the hoop and the Mor-
gantown townspeople had to sit back
and watch their favorites be com-
pletely outclassed during these ﬁrst
20 minutes.

The Mountaineers decided to make
a ball game out of it as the second
half started and Squint Phares, Andy
Mestrovic, and Art Colebank put in
scoring eﬁorts to bring the count up
to 15-13. It was right at this time that
the smell of scorching leather began
to ﬁll the ﬁeld house as the Panther
passing attack moved into high gear.
In rapid succession, Messrs. Roderick,
Emrick, and J esko were ﬁnding them-
selves free under the hoop and regis-
tering ﬁeld goals on set-up shots. That
went on until the scoreboard read
23-16.

Here Andy Mestrovic decided to do
a little sharpshooting from the Moun-
taineer stronghold but his direct hit
for two points only served to start the
Panthers running wild again. This
time they ran in six points to bring
the evening totals to 29-18. Big Joe
Stydahar did another sniping job and
made it 29-20. -

Billy Jesko and Skip-p-y Hughes then
zipped through the Mountaineer de-
fense formations for the ﬁnal Panther
points. Red Gocke, whose sensational
shooting all year had been a big fac-
tor in the West Virginia success, got
his only points of the evening then, as
he dropped in two foul shots just be-
fore the gun sounded.

The Panthers appeared to have
Gocke and Stydahar, ace shooters of
the mountain boys, bottled up almost
completely. Together, the two scored
only ﬁve points. Squint Phares, a
sophomore guard who won all-district
recognition, was the leading scorer
for the Mountaineers, bagging nine
points.

Ross Emrick again led the scoring
for the Panthers, his four ﬁeld goals
and three fouls giving him a total of
11 _r.»oints. Skip H.ughes was not far
behind with seven markers, and Billy
Jesko and Ted Roderick tied for third
honors with six points apiece.

jabs ﬂoating around the Morgantown
ﬁeld house Friday and Saturday dur-
ing the annual Eastern Intercollegiate
boxing championships.

Coach Jack Schricker will enter a
strong Panther team hoping that a

nex individual titles. Best chances
for crowns appear to fall to Captain
Jimmy Giannatti, who will be making
his last bid for an Eastern conference
title. Vvitli Jimmy will be Bernie
Speigel_ who will cause opponents
pler.1t_v of trouble before he is through.

Al Paslowski will ﬁght in the 125-
pound division. Joe Kopp, Panther
16-5-pounder, will go into action should
his injury heal up in time,

The Pitt men will leave town on
Friday for their VVest Virginia home
for the week-end.

Erie Tech Wins
Interscholastics

Three Meet Records Lowered;
Two Pitt Marks Broken

In one of the most liotly-contested
meets in the history of the events,
Erie Technical high school, by the
margin of a single point, won the
twenty-ﬁrst annual Interscholastic
swimming meet held "at Trees pool
Saturday afternoon and evening.

Erie Tech copped the ﬁrst place
l.onor.s with 17 points. East High of
Akron was second with 16, and Mc-
Kinley high of Canton, the defending
champion, was third with 14.

Two new University records were
set up by Jack Denny and Russ Lind-
berg in the Pitt championships held
in conjunction with the scholastic
meet. Denny lowered the 100—yard
freestyle mark from 54.8 seconds to
54.6 seconds. Lindberg established a
new pool record of 2 minutes, 18.2
seconds in the 220-yard freestyle.

Bob Wagner, of Columbus East,
broke the 220-yard freestyle record in
the high school meet, making the dis-
tance in 2 minutes. 21.7 seconds. Ed
Pope, of Shaker Heights, Cleveland,
established a new time for the 100-
yard backstroke, swimming the dis-
tance in one minute, 5.2 seconds, and
Dobrolosky, Erie Tech star, hung up
a new mark of 55.6 seconds for the
100-yard freestyle.

Kappa Sigs Are Greek Gods
Of Frat Basket Ball League

 

Stop Delta Tau Delta, Champions of Last Year, By 27-19
Score In Fincil Tourney Game

The Ka.ppa Sigma Greeks replaced Delta Tau Delta, ’34 winner, as rulers
of Interfrat basketball Monday night on the Trees Gymnasium court, by
whipping last year’s champs, 27-19. it was the red and white of Kappa Sigma
all the way, with Marty Groat, former sta.r of the undefeated freshman club
of 1933, and John Michelosen, former Ambridge and All-WPIAL performer,

setting the pace.

The Sigs got oﬁ to a fast start immediately.

a ﬁeld goal by Michelosen, and then
a long shot by Beachler followed in
quick succession. Fouls and ﬁeld
goals by Groat and Hensley piled up
an 11-1 lead at the quarter for the
new champ-s, Kappa Sigma’s passing
attack with Miclielosen in the hole,
Hensley and Beachler in the corners,
and Great and Delicli throwing it in,
worked smoothly in this ﬁrst period
of play.

In the second quarter, play of the
Kappa Sigs was ragged. Michelosen
missed two set—ups under the basket
with no one near him. The Sigs pass-
ing attack sagged, and this was
countered by a Delt scoring spurt of
eight points. Al Duff, and Bobby Mc-
Clure, Panther gridder, started this
Delt drive, their only serious threat
during the entire game. The score at
the half stood 12-9, favoring the Kappa
Sigs.

In the third quarter, the red and
white Sig passers put the game on ice
with fast-breaking tip-off plays. Three
times in a minute during the second
period, the tip-off combination of
Hensley to Beachler to Michelosen
to Groat clicked for six quick points.

In the ﬁnal period, both teams play-
ed a rough, loose style of play.
Michelosen went out on four personals
and Great followed him. Long, wild
passes featured the closing minutes of
play. The ﬁnal score stood 27-19,
Kappa Sigma._

A foul by Beachler,

Groat was the outstanding man on
the ﬂoor, breaking up many Delt
passes and handling the ball to
Michelosen in the hole. Three fouls
and as many ﬁeld goals gave Groat
high scoring honors for the evening.

Kappa Sigma reached the ﬁnal
round, by defeating ﬁve league “B”
teams, Phi Kappa, Lambda Chi Alpha,
Phi Delta Theta, Sigma’ Alpha Epsilon,
and Pi Kappa Alpha. Delta Tau Delta
reached the ﬁnals by scoring victor-
ies in league "A” over Phi Epsilon
Pi, Pi Lambda Phi, Phi Gamma Delta,
Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Chi, and
Theta Chi.

Next week Kappa Sigma meets the
winner of the Tech Interfraternity
Tournament for the City-Interfrat ti-
tle.

More than 100 spectators lined both
sides of the Trees Gymnasium floor
to watch the Greeks battle it out for
the basketball olive wreath. The Kap-
pa Sig victory brought the Interfrat
honor back to North Dithridge street
after an absence of two years, when
the Sigs copped the honors in 1932.

Trachmen Set Up NewMiIe-RelayMarh

At Seventh Annual Armour Tech Meet 

 

Featured by its crack mile-relay
team, that set up its third straight
Armour Tech record in the last three
years, Coach Carl Olson’s Panther
track team for the -second time within
a week gave Mid-western track fans
another lesson in the art of running
by capturing the high honors in
the seventh annual Armour Tech re-
lays Saturday afternoon and evening.

The affair was held at the Chicago
university ﬁeld house.

Up against some of the strongest
track teams in the mid-west, the Pan-
thers again proved themselves one of

the best track outﬁts in the country. .

The mile—relayers, Kiger, Groat, Con-
nelly, and McDonald, lived up to ex-
pectations by cracking their own
Tech relay record hung up last year,
bettering the old mark by .8 of a sec-
ond in stepping the mile in 3 niiiiutes,
21.9 seconds. In three trips to the
Tech relays in the last three years,
the mile-relay team has shattered the
mile record each time. In 1933, they
established a record of 3 minutes, 23.5
seconds for the mile, and this Inark
bettered by .6 of a second last year.
Only 10 days ago they established a
new mile-mark in the CIC meet.

Each of the 11 men taken to the
meet managed to earn at least a place
in his particular event. Fred Kiger.
Panther leader, ﬁnished second in the
440-yard event, only a step behind
Jessel of Marquette. Arvel Fleming
placed second in both the 70-yard
low-hurdles and the 70-yard‘ dash.

In the mile, Sam Musico ﬁnished
ﬁfth, and Bonavita captured a like

position in the shot put. Two fourth
places were taken by Panther en-
trants, Cy Pelucha leaping to a fourth
position in the pole vaiilt, and the
medley-relay team of lViena_ker, Kirk-
patrick, Musico, and Connolly ﬁnishing
in that place. Blair, in the high jump,
tied for ﬁfth place.

Although no trophy was given to
the team ﬁnishing with the highest
number of points, the Panthers led
the other schools with a total of 23
points. Gold, silver and bronze medals
were given to the place winners.

Panther Deals Out Spring
Poetry, Bombshells Today

The bombshell of the ‘Military Ball
is exploded in today's issue of the
Pitt Panther, but the magazine is not
exclusively “Military Ball.”

in fac-t_ “hlucli Ado About a Satur-
day Night," a feature article by Helen
Rose Gibson, is anything but military.
In the center of the book, is the ﬁrst,
and perhaps the last, issue of the
“Daily Bugle" which plays up the
front page of a newspaper in EL way
it is seldom treated.

“This Thing Called Spring,” by Les-
iter Horn, attempts to ﬁnd out (-in
Horn's own way) just why spring
comes on lllareh 21.
