PITTSBURGH TREATY

Thomas G. Masaryk was the insti-
gator of much of the activity which
culminated in the Pittsburgh treaty
during the World war. This treaty
was an agreement among persons in
the United States interested in the
founding of a Czecho-Slovak re-
public.

As a result of the treaty, President
Wilson urged the founding of the re-
public in the post-armistice confer-
ence. Czecho-Slovakia was compos-
ed of portions of Austria-Hungary in
1919, and Masaryk was elected pres-
ident.

Hi.s son, Jan, became minister to
the United States, and shortly after-
wards minister to Great Britain,
which post he held until the recent
Munich pact. At present he is tour-
ing the United States.

GDK to Honor Prominent Seniors
By inscription of Names on Walls

BY Lewis Riley

Future University undergraduates
will cross from the Cathedral of
Learning to the Heinz Memorial
Chapel upon a University Senior
Walk.

Inscribed upon each sandstone
block of the walk will be the name
of a past senior man—one for each
year——who has been cited as the type
of student who best exempliﬁes the
qualities which the University aims
to produce: character, scholarship,
leadership, activities, and social bear-
ing.

Announcement of the laying of the
sandstone Senior Walk came late last
week from E. A. Batchelder, assist-
ant University registrar and secre-
tary of the University

honorary activities fraternity, spon-

‘sor of both the Senior Award and the 3

‘Veteran Coach Sends;
Letter to Chancellor 7 
Asking Leave to 
Decision to Quit Post Follows    ._
Talks With University Heads ] 3 

By Leonard Levison
Sports Editor
J ock Sutherlaiid has turned in his resignatioii.
Dr. Sutherland, varsity football coach for the past 15 ye.a.i‘s, "has.
requested to be relieved of his duties at the University, it was~1'e--

After two leiigthy conferences with ad1iiiiiistrat.ive oﬂicials last»
week, Snthei.-land sent a letter to Chancellor Bowman Saturday
' *°moi'ning.

“It was a very nice letter ofyrcsig-I
nation,” said Chancellor Bowman
when interviewed on campus late last
night. “But, I would not like to say
anything about itinow. This is a se-
rious matter and I want to be ad-
vised before I do anything.”

Sutherland’s contract with the Uni‘-
versity has a special t.wo—year clause
which stipulates that the University
must give him two years’ notice
before removing him from oﬁ"ice or
that Sutherland must give the’ Uni-
versity a two-year notiﬁcation b_e-
fore leaving himself. Bowman in-
dicated however, that he would re-
lease the football coach from this
restriction.

“Well, that kind of a contract real-
ly works only one way,” Bowman ex-
plained. “If a man wants to quit, we
can’t very well hold him to it.”

Sutherland’s request, many times
rumored during the past few years,
came as no surprise to University
athletic followers, who knew, since

administrative policy had made the-
Sutherland resignation an inevita-
bility.

That he had been on the point of"
resigning many times is also gener-
ally believed. Only reluctance to-
leave the University had been given.
as the reason for his staying.

Many times he had been heard to
say, “Pitt is part of me.” For in 1914
he entered the S-chool of Dentistry
and for the ensuing 25 years he has
been a continuous and integral part
of the University as student, dental
teacher, and as head varsity mentor
for 15 years.

Unable to be reached personally,
Dr. Sutherland did not have anything
to say anyway, a close source of in-
formation indicated. He will not
commit himself until a formal state-
ment of his resignation is made by
the University. ' '

Reports have him headed toward
the gridiron post at Mississippi State,

During his 15 coaching years oni
the campus, he developed Pitt info
the foremost football power in. the
nation. He, himself, had also becoméi
proclaimed as intercollegiate foot-~
bal1’s greatest coach, the number one
man in his profession. *

His Pitt teams won 111 games, lost“.
20, and tied 12. He produced seven-
Eastern championship teams —— in.

A Man, A Motto
And A Room

ll(-‘.s‘.% the unveiling of 2: bronze relief above tin:

Subject of the relief is the late Tliomas Crarriguc
Masaryk, founder and first president of the Czecho-
slovak republic; acconipanying the features of tile
late president is the motto of the post—wa'r re-
public “Pravda vitezi" or, translated
ionghly, “’l‘ri1th ».:oiiquc1's. "

~ :11; its program.

It seems to us p;u'ticularl_v ﬁtting that this relief
and motto should be the central feature in this,
iicwe.~'.t of the nzitioiiality rooms. -For M-asar_vk,l_
v.'i‘iliout il doubt the formnost ﬁgure in the recentl
hi:-.tory of his people, is also renowned the world
over as 2: brilliant statesiiiaii, philosopher, scholar,
and hiinizxnitariziii.

20 years of life in the true democratic traclition, be-
came known and 1'c:spcc'l;ecl cvcrywllere for its toler-
ance, its rapid progress, its high ideals. And its
motto, also the personal motto of the l'o‘under, was
not a mere wiuliow <lrc-.~;sing, but was the philosoph-
ical foundation stone of the ‘whole governiiient.

But at preseiit, all is not well with the now
l1‘\-phenatc-d Cze-.,-ho—Slovakia. The country and its
people, llllf()I'l11ll'clt€l}‘, have become the unwilling
pawns in the ganics played by both European clem-
ocfruclcs and uictator states. l)isine111bei'me11t and
(llSS0lulJl0l1 haunt the once secure republic.

Thus, the dedication of the little room on the
Forbes street side of the Cathedral will take on
added sigiiinczuice. Maiii address will be made by
the late leader ’s son, Jan Masaryk, who will. help
dedicate this room in the city where developed into

Men’s Glee Club 
Gives Recitals 

By Robert Brown §
The Men’s Glee Club, comprising 59 singer‘. pre-g
sented its annual pair of home concerts last Thursday?
and Friday evenings in the auditorium of the Foster:
Memorial. -1
This makes the fourth year I have reviewed these!
;-oncerts, and the performance I heard last Friday seem-
ed to be the most balanced of the bunch. The first tenor
section has been bolstered up, and the bass section does
not sing through its collective noses but provides notable
ground support. Director Finney has worked out the
difficult details of attack and voice blending. Pitch bor-
ders on the shady side at times.

Bach Number Best

In selecting the best number, I am admitting that I 
am biased when I single out Bach’s “Death, I Do Not
Fear Thee.” How this paunchy little organist, grinding
out thousands of works in the musty loft of St. Thomas’ ‘
church always managed to make everything he ever
wrote good must remain one of the most perplexing
questions confronting any student of music. Few recog-
nized the man’s genius, and yet, in the face of tremen-
dous obstacles and disappointments, Bach saw cosmic
forces twist and writhe at the command of his great
Lutheran God, and all of this is in his music.

The Glee Club sang this number last year. It was
wise of Mr. Finney to repeat it, for it is the club's big
number. The phrasing was clean and intelligent, the
climax overpowering.

Tschaikowsky’s “Nightingale” was another of the
better pieces. The solo tenor part gave Roscoe Byers a
good chance to use his milk and honey voice to advant-
age. The club dreamed along on this thing, and the au-
dience liked it.

But pitch reared its ugly head in two songs from the
Rubaiyat. of Omar Khayyam, set to music by Henry
Hadley, the American composer who died last year.
These pieces are difficult, and to make matters worse,
they were placed ﬁrst on the program. The tricky
chord changes and scoring were a little too much for the
hen before they were warmed up.

Feyka’s Lieder

Andrew Feyka, owning one of the best bass voices
heard here for a long, long time, was the soloist again
this year. He was weak on the somewhat artiﬁcial “Si
la Rigneur” from I-Ialevy’s opera, “La Juive,” singing
consi-stentl.y sharp. But in the two songs that followed,
namely, Schubert’s famous “Serenade,” and the beau-
Liful “Ye Who Have Yearned Alone,” by Tschaikowsiky,
he was great. It was Feyka’s first attempts at lieder,
but he sang them like a veteran who knew just what he
vs:-inted ‘to do.

The Varsity quartet nearly stole the show with their
renditions of Negro spirituals and numbers of the sort
wung after Rotary club banquets. Good stage presence
ll1Cl first rate singing put them across.

That the club has improved can be seen by a glance
In addition to the numbe‘3 mentioned,
the group tackled some difficult Southern folk songs, a
Czecho—Slcvakian dance tune, and kept in tune in all
of them. Mr. Finney has whipped the club into such
sliape that it needs no apologies on the part of anyone

It was a good concert.

After the New York board of censors started a mille-
balco, which to me was only an attempted publicity
stunt to boost the picture’s popularity, “Yes, My Darling
Daughter,” with three coats of whitewash and about as
“daring” as the polka, is currently showing at the Penn.

The most naughty line is spoken by “Granny.” played
by lovable May Robson, when she says, “God made the
trees and the flowers and the birds. I/Vhy did he have
to spoil it by inventing sex?” There, now, isn’t that
terrible? Tch, tch!

All this is an outgrowth of the
desire of Priscilla Lane and Jeff-
rey Lynn, unmarried, to spend a
week-end together before he sails
for a two-year stay in Europe,
where he will sell razor blades to
the Belgians. The two kids are
desperately in love and want only
to be alone to talk things
over.

Well, fellows, it’s‘ about time we
got down to cases. What good is, or
are, as the- case may be, (Bulletin In-
dex please note), politics? What
good is student government?

For some time now‘ we’ve been col-
lecting answers. Most of them seem
to amount to this: The only reason,
for the existence of SFA, Men’s
Council, etc._, is to provide “good
clean fun” and to act in an advisory
capacity to the administration.

That is known, over the beer
tables, as the “company union na-
tionale.” You all know what a com-
pany union is for. It’s. one of those
organizations which the bosses start,
control and end at will. It is a de-
vice to forestall workers from doing
anything on their own, and to build
up a loyalty which is often blind.

V/"ell most’ students seem to feel
that student government is supposedl

to do nothing more than a company i 

union- It is a paciﬁer to forestall
student action——like candy for a
baby—an.d it performs a few of the
more distasteful functions of school
administration. But it never, never
has any ideas that don’t conform
with the University’s notions on what
students should think.

As we said some time ago, we don’t
believe that students are incapable
of ruling themselves. We intend
from now on to present our case.

Every now and then we’ll add a bit l 

of evidence for our side.

Today we wish to present as our
ﬁrst witness, the top politician of last
year, Al Barr. Mr. Barr, incidentally
picked the late lamented Tech game

When last year’s plebescite was

tent argument on intellectual inde-
pendents: If we all go on in the
same side, the administration with

middle.
way and possessing a majority, we as
students will run things.

Unfortunately, there is no means of
testing whether this is true or not,
because nothing has happened in
SFA which might arouse any faculty
opposition. I

The second idea of Barr was to
send a representative of students di-
rectly to the board of trustees. Pre-
cisely what this representative’s pow-
ers should be, he wasn’t explicit.
But it’s still a good idea.

Next week grapevine reports on
the latest developments.

Washington, D. C.—Another crazy 6

twist in the you-beat—me-I’ll-beat-
you Eastern Intercollegiate Basket-
ball Conference was added here Sat-
urday evening when the Pitt Pan-
ther honked the Georgetown Hoyas
out of the title clincher, 44-39.

Even though the Panthers had
knocked off Georgetown earlier be-
fore in this hectic league season, they
were not expected to do the same
thing again the other night. George-
town was riding high in the Con-
ference first place position and a vic-
tory would have given the Hoyas
their ﬁrst plaque-hanging year.

Nevertheless, Pitt’s sophomoric
bunch of basketballers conﬁrmed the
report that they were no respecters of
form and earned their place among
the . thcr screwball teams in the cir-
cuit. They played the same kind of
fast, hard basketball that has dis-
tinguished certain of their better-
earned triumphs this year.

Starting fast, the Panthers clribbled
into an early game 6-0 lead. This
was about the most substantial mar-
gin they had during the entire eve-
ning. At the halftime, Dr. Carl-
scn’s ice-cream eaters were in posses-
sion of a slight one point lead, 22-21.

This lead was increased as the
second half progressed and it was up
to four points as the contest drew
to a close. Georgetown, possessed of
a few dead long-shots, tried desper-
ately to overhaul the Carlsonmen.
But, apt at freezing the ball and also
at close, aggressive guarding, the
Panthers maintained their edge.

This was the second of the home-
and-home games between the league
opponents. In the first meeting at
the Stadium a few weeks ago, Pitt
also edged out ahead of Elmer Rip-
ley’s Capitol City boys. The Panther’s
repeat win was further unexepected
because of the inadequacy of the
Hoyas’ floor, which has made them
prohibitix-‘e favorites in their home
games.

All of the points tallied by the
Panthers were made by their sopho-

Plfaffrath, and Kocheran, who have
been the leading Pitt scorers all sea-

MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1939

The “All Point” trophy has moved
across the street!’ ..

Phi Delta Theta stole this prized
trophy from under the noses of Phi
Gamma Delta and Delta Tau Delta
to have its name. placed beside its
neighbor, Kappa Sigma, as the win-
ner for the year of 1938-1939.

It was an eager quintet that met
last Thursday to total the points to
determine the winner. The meeting
was comprised of Mr. Corley, Bernie

munds of the Phi Gams, John Dow-
me of Delta Tau Delta, and the Pitt
News fraternity reporter. . A

Totaling the points scored by th
champs the sum reaches 520, just 11
points ahead of the second place
Fijis and 14 points better than Delta
Tau Delta.

Phi Gamma Delta had its mantle
dusted to house the huge trophy, but
a forfeit in a ping pong match cost
them 20 points and ﬁrst place.

Delta Tau Delta (so it is rumored)

3.2 with which they intended to ﬁll
the trophy after Friday’s I-F Ball,
but this will either be returned or
will be emptied from the ping pong
trophy.

Included in the scoring of the
‘points were basketball, indoor track,
bowling, ping pong, outdoor track,
mushball, sweepstakes, and scholar-
ship, all carried over from last year,
and this year’s events. which were
basketball, indoor track, bowling,
ping pong, volleyball, Interfraternity
Sing, touch football, and scholarship.

The total of last year’s sports of the
three leaders placed the Fijis ahead
with 223' followed by the Delts, 212,
and Phi Delts, 203.

Basketball and touch football points
gave the winning Phi Delts enough of
a margin to surpass its two chief con-
tenders. It was a" pure case of con-
sistency that brought the Phi Delts
to the front.

Delta Tau Delta failed to repeat its
performance of the second semester
in the class room and placed third in
scholarship, receiving only ﬁve points
instead of 25 which would have given-
chem the lead.

were hampered by several tough
breaks, the Phi Kaps showed enough‘
to convince even the most skeptical‘
that they would have won no matter
what the conditions were.

Dick Cassiano put in two foul shots
to open the scoring, but Joe Kristufek
tied it up with a ﬁeld goal from close
in. Before Joe sank a foul shot for
the Newmans’ next point, the Phi
Kaps had run the score to 8-2.

Chieﬂy through Joe’s efforts, the
Phi Kaps were able to hold only a
17-8 edge at the half, Kristufek’s six
points and Czyzewski ﬁeld goal ac-
ounting the Newman’s total.

Goodell, Wassell, and Ryan entered
the game for Phi Kappa to start the
second half while Connell, I-Ierron,
and Cassiano took a rest, but the subs
did as well as the varsity and kept
the ball rolling through the hoop.

Panthers Seek

Win Over Dukes

Revenge is the thing tomorrow
night when the Pitt hockey boys at-
tempt to shatter Duquesne’s 12 game
winning streak at John Harris’ Craig
street hockey palace.

The Dietrich Dazzlers have twice
included the Panthers in their list of
victims, but their lone setback was
at the hands (or sticks) of those same
Panthers in the third game of the
season.

Pitt took a 2-1 decision in that
match and since have lost to the
Dukes, 2-0, and 3-2. Of the 10 shots
pushed past goalie Bud Ellis so far,
six have, thus, been propelled by
Vance and Co.

The game means little as far as
league standing is concerned, since
should Pitt win, the Dukes would
still have to lose to either Tech or
Case while the Panthers took over
Penn, John Carroll, and Tech in or-
der that the McSorley Menace might
ﬁnish on top by one point.

All precautions have been taken to
avoid a recurrence of the riots which
marred the ﬁrst three Pitt-Duke
games. To prevent a repetition of
the charge of partial olﬁciating
league oﬁicials have promised the
two schools that two members of the
Hornet professional team will work
the game.

Woodruff, Bennett

Receive Honors

Johnny Woodrulf, Pitt’s Olympic
star, and Pete Bennett, University
high jump record holder, recently had
‘their names added to the 1938 Colle-
giate Honor Roll which consists of the
names of the outstanding track and
'ﬁeld stars of the United States.

The Collegiate Honor Roll is based
on performances by eligible college
men in the season of 1938. The rank-
ing is determined by votes of the
Rules Committee and representative
coaches from all sections of the
country.

Bennett was cited for his leap of 6
feet, 51/1;; inches in the I. C. 4 A. games
:in New York last year, while ‘Wood-
_ruff’s time of 47 seconds for the 440
'yard dash, and 1 minute, 51.3 sec-
onds for the 880 yard run were re-
corded as outstanding achievements.

‘Trncth ‘Conquers’

Theme oi Czech Natieiiality Room
Centers in Motto, ‘Pravda Vitezi’

By E. Seymour Kerber-

“Pravda Vitezi,” “Truth Conquers,”
is the motto of the Czech-Slovak
republic about which the symbolism
of the Czecho-Slovak Room is built.
The motto appears above the black-
board at the front of the room, on
each side of a bronze relief of presi-
dent-liberator Thomas G. Masaryk.

Panels forming the front end of
the ceiling contain eight portraits of
outstanding personalities of Czech
and Slovak history. These are the
eight men who the committee decid-
ed were those with whom young
Americans should be familiar.

The rosy grain of the larchwood
used in the room was brought out by
hand applications of linseed oil.

BEAMED CEILING

Art work on the room was done by
Mr. and Mrs. Karel Svolinsky, who
spent two months in Pittsburgh deco-
rating the room. The broad beamed
ceiling has been decorated in the
fashion of old Slovak churches, with
native ﬂowers. Carved notches on
the beams are painted red and green
and ornamented with Slovak geome-
trical ﬁgures.

The plaster walls, decorated with
colorful Moravian designs, are mel-
low white. Miraculous trees which
grow ﬂowers, birds, and insects with
irridescent wings are depicted on the
walls.

In a niche at the rear of the room,
painted decorations form a tree of
life design explaining the ancient
Persian origin of Czecho-Slovak art.
The branches of the tree of life
emerge from behind a beautiful illu-
minated parchment, the proclama-
tion of Charles IV, King of Bohemia,
when he founded the University of
Prague in 1348.

FURNITURE OF OAK

The furniture for the Czecho—Slo-
vak Room is of oak, upholstered in
red leather. The panels in the pro-
fessor’s desk and the panels in the
entrance door are of magniﬁcent
“intarsio” or inlay, such as is found
in palaces of the Czech Renaissance.

The panels in the ceiling contain
portraits of Cyril and Methodius,
Byzantium priests, who converted
Eastern Europe to Christianity; Knize
Vaclav, the “good King Wenceslas”
of the familiar Christmas carol; Jan
Hus, the great Czech religious re-
former; Comenius, the great teacher,
once offered the presidency of Har-
vard university; Jan Kollar, nine-
teenth century pan-Slav poet; and
Stur and Moyzez, the former the
originator of Slovak grammar, the
latter the founder of the Slovak in-
stitute.

Sandwiches Pity

For Social Center

EVANSTON, Ill. —- (ACP) — The
ﬁrst building in the world to be erect-
ed on a foundation of sandwiches

will shortly rise on the campus of
Northwestern university.

The building is Scott Hall, the new
student social center and community
auditorium to be erected at a cost of
$750,000 as a tribute to President
Walter Dill Scott, who will retire
next fall. In a very real sense it will
be built on a foundation of sand-
wiches, for a $200,000 Woman’s
Building fund, which was begun with
sandwich sales in 1911, has been
turned over to the Scott Hall fund by
the Woman’s Building association.

Determined coeds chose November
29, 1911, as the ﬁrst of a series of
“Sandwich Days” on the campus. On
these occasions defenseless male stu-
dents and faculty members were per-
suaded by feminine tactics to eat
sandwiches for the beneﬁt of a social
centerfor women.

Elliott Will Discuss
Oriental Art Techniques

Phillip C. Elliot, assistant professor
of ﬁne arts, will give an illustrated
lecture on “Notes on Oriental Tech-
niques” in the ﬁne arts library, Wed-
nesday evening at 8:30 o’clock.

One of Mr. Elliot’s water color
paintings won a prize in the exhibi-
tion of the Associated Artists last
year. He is a graduate of the Yale
university school of ﬁne arts.

cil’s latest aid to the student body,
according to Robert Corley, assist-
ant dean of men, and Richard

pose to show the student body how
they can put manners to good ad-
vantage in every day life.”

Forum discussions will be held

Mme. Majeslia Presents Views
On Modern lnterior Decorating

A
7

By Nancy Welfer
Addressing a group of undergrad-

uate women recently, Madame Ma-
jeska, noted designer and decorator
from New York, spoke of the inﬂu-
ence of color on mood.

“Most persons are not conscious
of what color does to them,” said
Mme. Majeska. She then Went on to
describe an apartment she had dec-
orated all in blue for herself. After
a few weeks of living in these sur-
roundings, she said she was ﬁt for a
psychopathic ward. Then she learn-
ed that the particular shade she had
chosen was the one. Egyptians used
for the inside of their tombs.
BALLET DANCER.

The famous designer, once a dancer
in the Russian ballet, prefers white
for her own rooms. Since there are
as many kinds of white as there are
other colors, she has much scope for
variety.

Her ofﬁce at Modernage, the ﬁrm
of New York interior decorators, for
example, has a white rug. “Of course,
it’s rather grey now, as I have from
12 to 15 thousand people going
through my office in a year,” she ex-
plained, adding, “But then it was too
white in the beginning.”

Two walls and the ceiling of this
office are a smoke-blue, almost black.
The other two walls are of'f—white.
Dark furniture stands against the
dark walls, and white furniture
against the others. This provides a
good background for showing colors
to clients.

GLASS CURTAINS

The l.ight in this room hits the
ceiling vertically and the walls hori-
zontally so as to give a feeling of
space.

Light colors are just as practical
as dark. even in Pittsburgh, claims
Mme. Majeska. Dark furniture is
allowed to get dirtier because the
dirt does not show as easily. Dark
rugs, however, show every bit of
dust and are liable to be stained by
anything dropped on them.

“I thing that people are much
more important than their back-
ground,” she explained as her rea-
son for preferring walls that match
furniture, not contrast with it.

gested for making windows appear

Continues Climb

During Wleek '

Gains in industrial production and,
in the volume of trade last week;
raised the index of business activity"
in the Pittsburgh district to a new;
high level for 1939, the University;
Bureau of Business Research report- i
ed today. |

Cancelling all of the drop recorded:
in January, the index reached 86.5:
per cent of the 1923-25 adjusted level, I
advancing to less than a point below ;
the peak reached the ﬁrst week mi
December, when the last recovery;
period terminated. Gains in steel-'
mill operations, blast-furnace activ-
ity, and bituminous coal production
brought the rise in industrial activ-
ity. Although department store sales
and electric power production de-
clined, working schedules of steel
mills were increased to an all—year
high level.

In the monthly “Pittsburgh Busi-
ness Review,’? the Bureau reports that
business activity in the Pittsburgh
district, in a comprehensive survey
of eleven counties, averaged 2-3 per
cent lower in January than in De-
cember.

The drop was due mainly to a cur-
tailment in the volume of trade. In
the ﬁrst three weeks of February the
average remained about the same as
in January.

Announces Kairys

The 1939 Owl will close its un-
dergraduate sales campaign on Fri-
day, according to Al Kairys, BA3’-J,
business manager.

“There are still some students
who would like to purchase an Owl
this year, but who do not seem to
be ﬁnancially able to do so,” says

1 Kairys.

“We would like to remind all
such students that they have this
week to make a down payment of

i only one dollar and ﬁfty cents, and

the rest of March, all of April, and
part of May in which to pay the
remaining two dollars.

“We feel sure that we have a
good yearbook, and we would like
to see all the students who can pos-
sibly do so make their down pay-
ment this week.”

According to Kairys, the Owl has
moved a desk out into the eighth
ﬂoor hall for the convenience of
anyone who would like to buy an
Owl and does not see a salesman.
