Max Blumenthal takes

rhetorical aim at Israel

Andrew Shull
News Editor

 Max Blumenthal, a best—selling
Jewish author and journalist,

launched a scathing verbal as-
sualt on “liberal Zionism,” or
the group of liberals in Israel
who support the Jewish State.

Blumenthal, speaking for an
hour in Posvar Hall to a crowd
of about 100 people, argued that
liberalism and Zionism are in-
commensurate ideals. He said
Israel, from the launching of
its state, was formed to be an
ethnic state, a state that favors
the ethnic majority.

“It was essentially founded
to become an apartheid state,”
Blumenthal said.

However, Sam Mellits, the
president of Panthers for Israel,
a pro-Israeli advocacy group,
characterized Blumenthal’s in-
vocation of the South African
system in application to Israel
as “absurd” and “offensive.”

“Arabs in Israel can ride on

the same busses [as Jews]. They
are members of Parliament.
They sit on the Supreme Court.
They can hold high ranks in the
military,” Mellits said.
"A Mellits contended that the
Apartheid in South Africa was
based on race and that no such
program exists in Israel. Mel-
lits did not attend the event
because of the Jewish holiday
Yom Kippur.

But Blumenthal argued that
the apartheid conclusion is val-
id. He said that the Israeli pres-
ence in the West Bank and Gaza
was meant to be a permanent
feature of Israeli society, not a
temporary condition.

Blumenthal’s conclusion fo-

cused on the nature of the two-
state solution, which would fea-
ture ajewish majority in Israel
and a Palestinian majority in
Palestine. He maintained that
a two-state solution, favored
by most peace seekers on the
Israeli left, amounts to segre-
gation, and the liberal ideal of
multiculturalism isn’t shared by
liberal Zionists.

“That puts them to the right
of neo-fascists [in the West],”
Blumenthal said.

He said that even far right
ﬁgures in America and Europe
would not adopt the policies the
Israeli liberals adopt toward
Palestinians.

He also maintained that the
occupation of the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip, two autonomous
Palestinian areas to the south
and west of Israel, were always
intended to be “pseudo-states,”
closely monitored by Israel.

Again, Mellits disagreed with
Blumenthal’s assessment. Mel-
lits saidthat Israel’s borders
were never supposed to be per-
manent. .He favors a two-state
solution that features fair land
swaps in terms of population
and the quality of the land.

While Mellits agreed with
Blumenthal that forming states
along ethnic borders might
seem offensive to Western, lib-
eral thinking, he said it was a
matter of fact on the ground.

“The world is made up of
nation-states,” he said, adding
that it makes sense to draw bor-
ders according to which people
would like to live in which state.

Blumenthal also aimed to

take down a few key myths he V

said exist regarding liberal Zi-

Students register to vote over dinner at Market Central

Mahita Gajanan
Staﬁ” Writer

As the Oct. 7 deadline for voter registration
approaches, student groups are ﬁnding cre-
ative ways to get students to register.

Student Government Board’s Food and
Governmental Relations committees teamed
up with Pennsylvania Public Interest Re-
search Group, a nonpartisan organization,
to hold a voter registration event called
“Rock the Vote” at Market Central Wednes-
day night.

“The point is to get people to vote before
the deadline,” said Gordon Louderback, an
SGB member and head of the Food Com-
mittee.

SGB and PennPIRG stationed a table at
the front of Market Central adorned with

posters and balloons and playing rock mu- .

onism. ‘

First, he argued that the “golden age”
of Israel, the period
between its founding
and the start of the
Six-Day War in 1967,
was marred by ethnic
cleansing, massacres
and a “war of expul-
sion” precipitated by
a pervasive “colonial”
mentality.

He pointed to nu-
merous liberal leaders
who committed war
crimes and expelled
Arabs from their
homes.

Blumenthal said
that while right-wing
Zionists are often
blamed for the tension
between the Israelis
and Palestinians, the
Israeli right and Is-
raeli left cooperated
throughout all of Is-
raeli history.

During this time
period, Blumenthal
said right-wing Zionists held the atti-
tude that “Secular Zionism is the don-
key. They will ride the donkey until they
establish ajewish theocracy.”

Blumenthal also argued that it was

‘Wt\Nas
essenHaHy
founded to be
an apanhem

state.”

Max Blumenthal

would be made immediately aware of the
event. On the table were voter registration
forms, which students could ﬁll out and give
back to SGB.

“We just wanted to have it in a casual
setting,” said Board member Natalie Rothen-
berger. “We ﬁgured Market was a good lo-
cation.”

To help make the event more exciting,
Market chefs served up American—themed
food.

The groups plan on emphasizing the im-
portance of registration in the upcoming
weeks. “Rock the Vote” is the kick—off event
to push registration. V

Ryan Mulson, a 2012 Pitt graduate, is
the campus organizer for PennPIRG’s new
voter project. He started working to regis-
ter voters at Pitt halfway through August,
and he plans to really push to get students
registered in the next two weeks.

“Our goal is to register 2,000 students,”

a myth that the liberal Zionists were
“pro—peace.” .

“Their kind of peace is different than
our kind of peace,” he said.

For evidence, he pointed to mandato-
ry military service even for the children
of hardcore liberal
Israelis who comply
with Israel’s compul-
sory military service
alongside his claim
that Israel wants to
create a permanent
occupation in the
West Bank and Gaza.

F i n ally, h e
brought 40 pages
of quotes featur-
ing Israeli liberals
saying that “time is
running out” before
Israel will become an
apartheid state.

“That’s like say-
ing this table could
become a table,” he
said.

Students for Jus-
tice in Palestine
president Ryan
Branagan said the
event was a success.
Even though Blu-
menthal’s rhetoric
put him, by his own admission, outside
the mainstream dialogue, Branagan
thought it was warranted.

“I think it’s the way forward,” he said.
“We need to have this conversation now.”

Mulson said. So far, PennPIRG has registered
about 300.

PennPIRG’s efforts include participating
in events like “Rock the Vote,” approaching
students on the street and giving students
the opportunity to print out registration
forms at the website StudentVote.org.

“Students can print out the forms, ﬁll
them out and take them to the SGB ofﬁce,”
Mulson said. “They have boxes where you
can submit the registration forms.”

Efforts to get students registered by
SGB,PennPIRG, Pitt College Democrats and
Obama for America have paid off in the num-
ber of Pitt students that are now registered.
Most students who came to “Rock the Vote”
were already registered. Aside from needing
to register, students had questions about
receiving their voter identiﬁcation cards
and whether their forms had gone through
properly, Rothenberger said.

“I think it’s exciting because it’s a lot of

people’s ﬁrst chance to vote,” Louderback
said.

As the election nears, the efforts to get
students registered grow.

“There was a study done in 2004 that
found that 80 percent of young people Pen-
nPIRG registered actually voted,” Mulson
said. “So we ﬁgure that getting them to reg-
ister is the most important.”

Mulson said that the event was not a
campaign for the Democratic Party, even
though most young people tend to register
as Democrats. ,

Mulson, Louderback and Rothenberber
would not say which candidate they sup-
ported in the 2012 election because SGB and
PennPIRG are nonpartisan groups.

“We’re nonpartisan,” Mulson said. “Who-
ever students want to vote for is up to them.
We just want to get them registered.” I

Peace Corps a_ virtuous, potentially dangerous job

Zach Harr
Staff Wrz'ter

It’s been 51 years since Presidentjohn F.
Kennedy founded the Peace Corps. And
since, according to its official website,
more than 210,000volunteers have been
assigned locations around the world to
complete his mission of promoting world
peace and friendship.

But packing up and heading to an un-
known part of the world can be a daunt-
ing mission, one that can be fraught with
danger and difﬁculty.

Rashawna Chapman from San Diego re-
cently returned from her 27-month com-
mitment with the Corps and described
her experience abroad as “the toughest
job you’ll ever love.”~ She presented her
experiences along with past Peace Corps
volunteer and now—recruiter]onnett Mau-
rer Tuesday evening at an info session in
room 538 of the William Pitt Union.

Chapman volunteered in the Common-
wealth of Dominica, a Caribbean island
northwest of Martinique, and Maurer
spent 2001 to 2003‘ volunteering in the
West African country of Togo.

Benefits to attract applicants that are
associated with the Peace Corps include
student loan assistance, travel to and from
volunteer service locations, full medical
and dental coverage and 48 paid vaca-
tion days.

“There should be no ﬁnancial com-
mitment on your part to serve in Peace
Corps,” Maurer said to the roughly 30
people in attendance. “There’s no fee to
participate. Everything is provided for
you.”

But interested applicants have to con-
sider the safety and security measures
surroundingjoining the Peace Corps.

Sarah Winston, a junior majoring in
Spanish and anthropology, was among
those who attended Tuesday night’s info
session. Winston understands the dangers
that could come her way as a possible
volunteer.

“The stories are out there,” she said. “I

really try to keep them out of my mind. In

terms of being prepared, I trust the Peace
Corps to give me the tools necessary to be
safe and make good decisions no matter
where I am,” she said.

“The safety and security of our volun-
teers is the Peace Corps’ top priority,” an
emailed statement from the Peace Corps
said. “Over the past couple of years we
have put in place new practices and safe-
guards to better protect volunteers and
ensure victims of crime receive compas-
sionate and effective support.”

The importance of keeping safety and
security strong for volunteers was reaf-
firmed in a testimony from Peace Corps
Director Aaron S. Williams in front of the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
in October 2011.

“The Peace Corps has had many suc-
cesses, but there have been setbacks too,”

“The Peace Corps
has had many
successes, but
there have been
setbacks too.”
Aaron S. Williams

he said. “In order to build on our achieve-
ments, improve our operations and ensure
we meet new challenges and opportunities
head-on, the agency has embarked on a
wide-ranging series of reforms.”
Among those reforms include hiring
the Peace Corps’s first victim advocate
for victims to turn to for help, issuing “a
set of core principles to ensure [the Peace
Corps employees] provide timely, effec-
tive and compassionate support to victims
of sexual assault” and improving previ-
ously provided sexual assault training.
A month after Williams’ testimony,
President Barack Obama signed the Kate
Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection

Act of 2011, named after and in honor of

a Peace Corps volunteer murdered while
serving in Benin in 2009. ‘

According to govtrack.us, a website
promoting government transparency,
the bill amended the Peace Corps Act to
require sexual assault risk—reduction and
response training while also establishing
the Ofﬁce of the Victim Advocate and a
Sexual Assault Advisory Council.

The ﬁrst three months of the 27-month
commitment are focused on training for
the remaining two years of a volunteer’s
assignment.

In an email interview, senior Priyanka
Kaura, who was at the information session
and is considering applying for the Peace
Corps, also said she has thought about
possible dangers and what she could do
to prepare. S

“I don’t think there’s much to do except
for taking a self-defense class, reading
about the area where I get placed and act-
ing conﬁdent while traveling,” Kaura said.

Chapman offered some advice to ap-
plicants wary of joining because of pos-
sible dangers. _

“[The Peace Corps] is not worth giving
up for possible dangers,” she said in a
later email. “We live every day of our lives
with possible dangers whether we live in
the U.S. or not. Push your way through
the long application process. It is well
worth the wait.”

The time from starting the application
to becoming an official volunteer can take
upward of a year or more.

Maurer stressed during the info ses-
sion that interested students should apply
before the Sept. 30 deadline to be eligible
to leave for an assignment in the spring
and summer of 2013.

While going through age statistics for ‘

those who serve with the Peace Corps,
Maurer gave an example which drew a
few mouths agape with surprise.

“There’s no upper-age limit,” she said.
“The oldest volunteer rightinow is 85, and
he’s in Botswana. So certainly, as long as
you’re able to serve and have skills to offer
and are medically able to serve, we will
put you into service.” I

were there. But camping outside isn’t ﬁxing
anything,” Grimes said. “They only way to ﬁx
anything is get people in power who want to
bring about the change that you see .”

So Grimes took the last spring semester off
to begin his campaign for U.S. Congress.

At ﬁrst, Grimes tried to get on the ballot as
an independent candidate, and he set out to get
the 1,961 signatures he would need to get his
name onto ballots in Pennsylvania’s 14th. After
personally collecting about 1,200 signatures,
Grimes decided his time could be better spent
elsewhere. ,r

“I started realizing that hitting the streets
wasn’t spreading the message as well as focus-
ing my energies towards tweeting and maybe
having a tweet go viral or something I said on
Facebook go viral,” Grimes said.

Since then," Grimes has run his campaign
mostly over social media and mostly by himself,
but from time to time he has recruited some of
his friends, including his tattoo artist Amber
Lambert, to do pro bono work.

“I’ve been tattooing Scott for a while,” Lam-
bert said. “And one day, I just came up with a
little picture forhimto use foracampaign ﬂyer.”

Lambert, a self-proclaimed soccer mom of
four who is tattooed from head to foot, said
she is not the kind of person who votes, but if
she were, she’d write in Grimes in November.

But potential write—in votes haven’t caused
any lost sleep at Rep. Doyle’s ofﬁce. Doyle’s
chief of staff, David Lucas, was not aware that
Grimes was still running and had assumed that
he wasn’t because Grimes never ﬁled with the
Pennsylvania Bureau of Elections to be on the
ballot. ‘ " .

Grimes might notbe headingto Washington

after Election Day, but he has learned a thing i

or two for when he runs for office again, which
he intends to do.
“Me just stepping out of the blue saying,

 I’m runningfor Congress,’ has created alot
giaf challenges for this campaign,” Grimes said.
 Next time he plans to take things a little

more slowly. V

“After the election, it’s my intention to get
involved in the local political scene  making
a name for myself so that come next election
cycle, people are well aware of who Scott Grimes
is,” he said. N V

Telefact’s budgeted $88,000 should be

spent on something modern 0

Rosie McKinley
Columnist '

What’s older: this writer, the Pi-
rates’ losing streak or TeleFact?
I’ll save you the ‘phone call on
this one:‘It’s TeleFact. And it is
time for TeleFact to go.

The decision to cut a beloved

quirk of our campus is not an

easy one. I love getting a free
TeleFact T-shirt at the activities
fair as much as everyone else.
And it sure is nice that someone
out there can tell me how many
blades of grass there are on the
Cathedral lawn. But the fact is,
in today’s world of ubiquitous
smart phones and economic re-
cession, TeleFact is no longer a
reasonable expenditure.

A lot has changed since Tele-
Fact’s founding in 1990 — pri-

marily, the world has been in-‘

troduced to a big thing called
the Internet. .

This thing has made Tele-
Fact obsolete. According to
the official University descrip-

tion, TeleFact answers ques-

tions about “campus activities,
sports, weather and local hap-
penings,” ranging from “Uni-

versity information to the uni-
versal.” They’ll«-answer anything
that doesn’t involve personal
academic or medical informa-
tion. All of that is wonderful.
And it is also all available on the
Internet. '

Speaking of the Internet, the
TeleFact website — the least
technologically advanced site
I’ve seen since the early 2000s
by the way —— does provide
some nice statistics about why
people call in. The main reason?
Transportation. About 16 per-
cent of calls are inquiries about
buses, yet my laptop or smart
phone can tell me through the
Port Authority website all about
busvroutes and when and where
to catch a ride.

In a pre—Internet, pre—smart
phone world like 1990, Tele-
Fact’s service was very sensi-
ble. But with my 4G iPhone, it
is downright paradoxical. Why
pay for a service to look up ba-
sic information when I am pay-
ing for the University to make
meta critical, self—sufficient hu-
man being? When information
was accessible only through

cumbersome encyclopedias or

reference books, TeleFact made
life simpler and more efficient.
But Pitt students today don’t
need someone to, type a ques-
tion into Google’s‘search bar for
them.

Maybe, despite it’s obvious
obsolescence, your romanti-
cized View of TeleFact as a fun
campus quirk remains. Well
then, consider this:

Each semester, non-College
of General Studies students pay
an $80 Student Activities Fee.
The resulting Student Activi-
ties Fund is a pool of about $2.3
million. When any of our 350
student clubs ask for funding
for things such as competitive
sports tournaments or academ-
ic conferences, it comes out of
this fund.

The fund also pays for Tele-
Fact, which is one of ﬁve for-
mula groups that receive a set
amount of money from the
fund. For TeleFact, it receives
about 3.4 percent for a total of
more than $88,000 each year.

ate student body — the only

COLUMN

Neither presidential candidate  
addresses issues of inequality  

Alex Zimmerman
Columnist

Last week was bad for people who
care about inequality. It actually
all began last May, when in an un-
characteristically unscripted mo-
ment, Republican ticket leader
Mitt Romney suggested to a room
of GOP donors that 47 percent of
Americans could never be per-
suaded to vote for him because of
their dependence on government
programs. He said, “I’ll never
convince them they should take
personal responsibility and care
for their lives.” Ouch.

Romney has attracted much— .

deserved criticism that ﬁts

squarely into the narrative that
he is out of touch with the middle
class and will protect job creators
(hint: 1 percent) at the expense of

' everyone else. While this analysis

isn’t totally wrong, it misses the
point: Neither presidential can-
didate is likely to do much to curb
the unprecedented and indefen-
sible concentration of wealth
among the super—rich.

Now that interest in the Oc-
cupy movement has effectively
evaporated, we’ve forgotten
about the pervasiveness of in-
equality in this country. Accord-
ing to Jacob Hacker and Paul
Pierson’s analysis of Congres-
sional Budget Ofﬁce data in their

book “Winner—Take-All Politics,”
the average annual household‘
after—tax income of the top 1 per-
cent increased by 256 percent
between 1979 and 2006. (ad-
justed for inﬂation and includ-
ing private and public beneﬁts).
They brought in, on average, $1.2
million per household in 2006.
In the same time period, the
poorest quintile rose a meager
11 percent. The yearly income of
the middle ﬁfth of household in-
comes increased 21 percent from
$42,900 to $52,100.

Apple’s new iPhone update not OMG Worthy, but still decent

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

The hype was considerable. It
always is. When Apple releases
something new, the world is ex-
cited. .

With the birth of the iPhone 5,
Apple released a new operating
system, iOS6, The company made
the software upgrade available
last Wednesday for those with the
now—antiquated products — the
iPhones 3GS, 4 and 45. As always,
iPhone users sat through a long
and painful software upgrade.

I was thrilled with the changes
back in September 2011.

After playing with the new
bells and whistles on my “old”
iPhone, I give it a resounding “eh”
overall. Maybe a six out of 10.

The Good:

iMessage brought us new
Emojis, those lovely emoticons
that we used back in the day of
AOL Instant Messenger. Even
though we’ve used them through
the Emoji app, iPhone users now
have even better smiley faces,
random objects and symbols
to better articulate our feelings
without words. I personally enjoy
the ‘ones that look like cats.

iMessage has a new blue color
scheme. It is aesthetically pleas-
ing. But that’s about it.

In terms of more important
things people actually consider,
the new “do not disturb” mode

is very promising. It allows me to
go, well, undisturbed, when the
option is activated or scheduled.
I can turn it on when I’m asleep or
in class and not have to worry if

i my phone is vibrating too loudly

as a friend calls me, wondering if
I’m meeting up with her for din-
ner.

iOS6 even gives me the ‘op-
tion to allow calls from certain

people who probably should not I

The new blue color scheme is pretty nice. MCT Capus

go ignored, like those from my
mother. V '
Even though my'iPhone is not
typically used for the purpose of
telephoning anyone, Apple has
surely added features thatimake
the phone, for its original pur-
pose, even more user-friendly.

The Bad:

The most‘ serious. complaint

 

that I have is one that is entirely
too common. Apple has replaced
its formerly Google—run maps ap-
plication with its own version.

Initially, I imagined that this
switch would be great. I heard
discussion of the turn—by—turn
navigation that Siri—compatible
phones would have, making the
phone function more like a GPS.
This sounded awesome, almost
as though the GPS unit in my car
could be eliminated.

Well, not so much. To say that
Apple’s Maps application de-
serves heavy criticism from users
is an understatement. It doesn’t
seem too trustworthy.

The Maps app has just missed
the mark. On the satellite view,
images appear blurry or some-
times as though the roads them-
selves have melted into the earth.
Less buildings and landmarks
are labeled on the generally less-
detailed maps. There’s even a
blog dedicated to Maps failures.

But the worst part is the
lack of transit integration. This
means if I were trying to go
downtown from the William Pitt
Union by bus, I could select ‘.‘bus”
as a mode of transport. However,
no bus lines or times would be
given. ’

I was shocked to ﬁnd that,
when I tried to get bus directions
on Maps, I was directed to the
App Store to download an en-
tirely separate appto give me the
information I was seeking.

User—friendly? Yeah, right.

The I’m-Not-So-Sure-Yet:

An entirely new feature here is
Passbook, which enables iPhone
users to store all of their loyalty
cards, tickets, boarding passes
and other things that weigh down
our purses and wallets onto the
phone itself.

This is great in theory. But in
order for me to ditch my CVS and
Rite Aid cards from my keychain,
these businesses will have to co-
operate with this new technology.

There’s nothing to suggest that
this will be as great as we have
imagined thus far. When I opened
the app, I selected “App Store” at
the bottom of the screen, only to
ﬁnd that there are a mere eleven
companies that have been inte-
grated. I’m hopeful that this will
expand exponentially once the
software upgrade becomes more
widespread.

Apple has certainly jumped
the gun here. The ﬂaws and un-
derdevelopment of certain new
features give the impression that
we were not quite ready for this

' new Apple revolution.

I haven’t been completely let
down, though I know others cer-
tainly have to the point of return-
ing to the old iOS5. I hope that
these ﬂaws will be tweaked based
on user reviews. Until everything
is up to speed, I’ll just continue to
play with the new Emojis. I

top ofthe income distribution.
This can’t be explained away by
the productivity of the rich and
implied laziness of the poor.
Rhetorically, it might seem
like Romney and President
Barack Obama have plans to
combat inequality. After all, they
both talk about getting Ameri-
cans back to work. Romney’s
plan involves cutting taxes across
the board by 20 percent to incen-
tivize job creation. Theoretically,

this will lead to an economic ex-
pansion that beneﬁts workers.
Obama wants our tax burdens to
shift so that those earning more
than $250,000 each year will
“pay their fair share.”

Forget for a moment that
Romney has yet to explicitly ex-
plain how these tax cuts will be
funded and that, unless there is
a signiﬁcant shift in Congress,
Obama will probably not be able
to meaningfully raise taxes on
the wealthy. Whether either of
these plans is politically feasible
is beside the point — neither will
change the picture of inequality
in this country, according to Jack
Ochs, an economic expert at Pitt
whose research explores ‘poverty
and inequality.

I asked Ochs what he thought
an aggressive agenda to combat
inequality would look like, and
he said, “We know that children
who are born into poverty have a

relatively poor chance of escap-
ing poverty as adults, in part, be-
cause they are poorly prepared to
enter school and never catch up.
There is signiﬁcant evidence that
intensive ear1y—childhood pro-
grams that develop important
non—cognitive skills would be
quite helpful in overcoming the
disadvantages ofyoung children
who are born into poverty.”
Neither candidate is likely to
get serious about policies like
this, because the poor can’t inﬂu-
ence elections with money — err
— political speech. This is the
ﬁrst presidential campaign since
public ﬁnancing became avail-
able in which both candidates
have waived their right to guar-
anteed campaign funds from the
government. It should come as
little surprise that as inequality
becomes more pervasive, candi-
dates will increasingly cater to
those who are capable ofwriting

big checks at $40,000-per—plate
fundraisers.

If we expect our politicians
to get serious about inequality,
there must be a sustained effort
to get unlimited and anonymous
soft money contributions out of
elections. I love freedom as much
as a guy in the top one-hundredth
of 1 percent, but do we really

i think that allowing multimil-

lionaires to disproportionately

shape the policy agenda serves

democracy? Unfortunately, in a
post-Citizens United world, it is
unlikely this will change any time
soon. But we should entertain the
idea of publicly ﬁnanced cam-
paigns anyway, so we can at least
imagine what it would be like to
have politicians who don’t have
to spend every waking hour beg-
ging rich people for money.

Two Yale professors, Bruce
Ackerman and Ian Ayres, have an
idea more plausible than simply

banning all campaign contribu-
tions and media buys. They want
to publicly ﬁnance a $50 ATM
card for every voter. It would act
like a voucher that would give
each voter a chance to contrib-
ute. At a cost of roughly $6 bil-
lion for Senate, presidential and
congressional races combined,
this new public money could
create powerful incentives for
candidates to propose policies
that appeal to average voters. It

wouldn’t take the money out of

politics, but it would help level
the playing ﬁeld. ,

Romney told some rich peo-
ple that 47 percent of Americans
will never vote for him because
of their dependence on govern-
ment. That’s not an indictment
of a guy who doesn’t care about
poor people. It’s an indictment of
a political system that won’t pun-
ish him for it. I

group that contributes to the fund, even
though the service is available to the rest
of the world for free —— is a population of
just under 18,000 students, each student
pays almost $5 to continue the opera-
tion.

For those of you who’ve called in won-
dering if the moon is bigger than the
Earth or questioning the legality of own-
ing a barracuda, maybe that more than
$88,000 is worth it. But for the majority
of Pitt students, we would beneﬁt more
from a different investment.

For example, how often do we find
ourselves searching for an available elec-
trical outlet in Hillman as our laptop bat-
teries dramatically dive deeper into the
red? Imagine if we could use that money
for more outlets in the library. Or what
if instead of closing at 6:00 p.m., we in-
vested the money into keeping the Ca-
thedral Cafe open an extra hour on week-
days so that it covered dinner? Heck,
with more than $88,000, we could even
contribute something to campus beauti-
fication: Posvar Hall could sure use some
creative murals in the hopes that a col-
orful interior would distract us from its
brutalistic architecture. Maybe we could
use some money to cover the electricity
costs of the victory lights for additional

victories. If football gets them for beat-
ing Gardner-Webb, shouldn’t the tennis
team light them up every once in a while
too?

TeleFact is just one ex-ample of a gra-
tuitous expense that the University could
invest elsewhere. Certainly the email

kiosks have fallen victim to the smart.

phone age, too. And there are other
things to question.

How many of us actually went to see
Cobra Starship at Bigelow Ba-sh last year?
Or how many of us really stand and Watch
those ﬂashy ﬂat-screen TVs throughout
campus as they repeat infomercials from
eager Student Government Board mem-
bers? As for Panther Prints, when was
the last time you picked up the college

yearbook?

The point is, even though Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg and the administra-
tion should be commended for taking
some necessary steps to keep tuition at
a reasonable rate, there are still many
ways to make Pitt a more cost—efﬁcient
university.

As the paying members of this institu-
tion, we should demand that our money
be spent on more than an obsolete, ex-
pensive service. You don’t need to call
TeleFact to know that.

IMPULSE

Lupe takes high stance on album, drops midway

 

Lupe Fiasco has worked to go against the hip-hop industry with his

music but has fallen short in past albums.

Rocks like: The death of-
a star

Grade: B

Lupe Fiasco is an enigma. From his
politically infused lyrics tohis on-
going battle with Atlantic Records,
the Chicago emcee has kept fans on a
rollercoaster ride the past two years.
And unfortunately, the ride isn’t over.

A/bum P2‘. 7. The newest album from
the controversial hip-hop star doesn’t
meet expected potential.

The last time I bought a physical
CD was in 2011 when Fiasco released
his previous studio album, L.a.rer.r. Al-
though I hadn’tbought a CD in nearly
a decade, the quality of Lupe’s ﬁrst

two albums — Food 2”?’ Liquor and
T/9e Coo/— left me no other option
than to support a fellow Chicagoan.
In the end, my attempt to back one of
my favorite artists in his battle against
big—business music resulted in disap-
pointment. _

From earning a dismal 57—out—
of—1oo rating by the popular web-
site Metacritic to provoking mixed
backlash from Fiasco’s faithful follow-
ers, Lwerrwas a ﬂop. Some believed
Lupe was to blame, while others be-
lieved that his record label, Atlantic
Records, was at fault. Both parties
were frustrated, as was Lupe himself.

After thanking his loyal fans with
an impressive rnixtape titled Hieizzl of
the People: I Fzg/at E122’/, I thought Lupe
was back. And when the singles for
Food <73?’ Liquor II: T/ye Greaz‘/l272en'mn

started to get excited. Tracks like
“Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t

about in his hit track “Superstar” — a

FILM REVIEW

‘Wallflower’ takes screen with infinite relatability

Kira Scammell
Staff W riter

“The Perks of Being a
Wallflower”

Directed by: Stephen
Chbosky

Starring: Logan Lerman,
Emma Watson, Ezra
l\/liller

Grade: B+

A group of outcasts, a helpful English
teacher and an overly enthusiastic
“Rocky Horror Picture Show” cast
make up Stephen Chbosky’s “The
Perks of Being a Wallﬂower” —— a
movie adaptation that shows “we
are inﬁnite.”

The simple, formulaic yet
thoughtful screenplay of this nov-
el—tumed—ﬁlm was written and di-
rected by the book’s author himself,
Chbosky. Its storyline might follow
a group of misﬁts through a year of
high school, but this is more than just

another teen movie.

On the surface, “The Perks of Be-
ing a Wallflower” is a coming of age
story. But beneath lies a myriad of
adult, real—life problems told through
the medium of adolescence.

It’s high school, and viewers are
reminded of this with every football
game, cafeteria ﬁght and rebellious
act of deﬁance throughout the ﬁlm.
But there exists an undertone of sin-
cerity and urgency to the movie that
indicates something real is wrong
with each of these characters, and
especially the story’s protagonist,
Charlie (Logan Lerman).

Charlie is a quiet high school
freshman tryingto ﬁnd aplace where
he feels he belongs. He ﬁnds solace in
a group called the Wallflowers, who
introduce him to drugs, alcohol, mu-
sic and “The Rocky Horror Picture
Show.”

The starring trio is rounded out by
Patrick (Ezra Miller), who is eclectic,
gay and compassionate, and his step-
sister Sam (Emma Watson), who is

WPTS COLUMN

Video game
creators
evolve
industry

Thomas Visco
WPTS C0m,‘rz'butor

Experimentation and innovation
define independent industries.
Art, music and film each have
their deﬁning innovators: those
who went against the grain of
commercial interests in favor of
pursuing an original idea.
Recently, video game design-
ers have also begun to push the
boundaries of their ﬁeld, form-
ing an avant—garde movement
known as indie gaming. No game
exemplifies this new develop-

ment more than “DayZ.”

Modifying the underap—
preciated title “Arma 2” — a
military simulator out of Bo-
hemia Interactive — “DayZ” is
a massive online, open-world
survival horror game set dur-
ing a zombie apocalypse in a
fictional post~Soviet Republic.
Launched in May 2012, “DayZ”
expanded quickly, reaching 1
million players in four months
and shattering expectationsifor
the relatively unknown project.

The game’s central mechanic
focuses on survival. Characters
require food, water and, in case
they run into trouble, weapons
and medical supplies. Play-
ers gather these necessities in
settlements and cities spread
across the map. But these towns
are infested with zombies, and
there’s also the near-constant
threat of running into other
players who might prove hostile.

The crux of this game is the
risk factor. If you want good sup-

plies, you have to risk your char-

acter’s life in dangerous parts of
the game world. And when your
character dies, you lose every-
thing, respawning without any
supplies from your former life.
This aspect of the game, known
as permadeath, makes “DayZ” so
different from canonical video
games such as “Call of Duty” and

“Battlefield” that it is jarring even to a
well-versed gamer.

With this feature, game designer Dean
Hall, known as “Rocket” in the gaming

The chaHenge

lies in how we

modern gamers rely on. Over the past
decade, the “Call of Duty” generation of
gamers grew to appreciate the triviality of
dying in game because one’s character can
simply respawn. Rocket and his ingenious
mod “DayZ” eliminated that safety net.

For Rocket, a good game doesn’t
arouse pleasure — or. even the satisfac-
tion of winning — in a gamer. Instead, he
thinks, video games should make gamers
feel something deeper. In “DayZ,” this
translates into the frustration and exhila-
ration of permadeath. The risk of dying
triggers a gut reaction to every decision
and every encounter. Rather than a super-
ﬁcial satisfaction, “DayZ” interacts with
the player on a visceral level. This un-
usual trend helps gamers understand how
“DayZ” fits into contemporary gaming.
Rocket is pushing boundaries; he is one
among many avant—garde designers, such
as Hidetaka Miyazaki, lead designer for
the critically acclaimed “Demon’s Souls,”
and the talented designers at Valve Cor-
poration, the team behind “Half-Life 2”
and “Portal.”

The avant-garde, often translated as
“vanguard” in English, began in 19th-
century France to describe a set of artists
who expressed themselves in innova-
tive ways. Oftentimes, this expression
went against norms established by the
academy, an elite class of artists. Notable
avant—garde trends can often be found in
countercultural or independent move-
ments, such as native Pittsburgher Andy
Warhol’s particular brand of pop art or
Nirvana’s progressive grunge music.

The challenge lies in how we under-
stand, appreciate and consume original
creations. If art is to be understood on
a superficial level, then the pleasure we

take from the consumption of a creative

act + viewing it, eating it or playing it —
might only rely on an initial gut reaction.
But art should be more than this. Great
art makes us feel something deeper, ap-
preciate something grander. It makes
us feel sadness and joy. It expands our
worldview, forcing us to contemplate
and worry.

Today, this sort of artist still exists in
the visual arts and music. Indie bands
such as Sonic Youth and Animal Collective
continually innovate their experimental
sound, challenging listeners to appreciate
talent even if the aesthetics don’t please
the ear. And often, one artist serves as the
vehicle by which the boundary-pushing
breaks through to the public. Skrillex, for
instance, popularized dubstep, a well-

established subgenre within the London
electronic scene.

In recent memory, video games have
lacked this sort of messianic figure. But
Rocket, an avant—garde and independent
designer, is changing the way garners
game. “DayZ” isn’t fun in the traditional
sense. It relies on shocking the player,
moving him or her between electrifying
adrenaline rushes and groan—inducing
frustration. In “DayZ,” the artist demands
the player to think about trust, worry
about every risk taken and even feel guilt
for wrongfully killing another.

In The explosion in “DayZ”’s player
base speaks for itself. The game has ex-
panded to 1.2 million unique characters
in just a few months. Not buying into the
commercial notion of satisfying gamers,
Rocket is pushing frontiers, challenging
gamers to appreciate something other
than immediate gratiﬁcation. For him,
gaming, like any art form, is never done.
“This is an experiment,” he said in an in-
terview with PC Gamer. “This is what we
should be doing as gamers, you know?”

“DayZ” constitutes a major shift in
gaming. Rocket is proving that a signiﬁ-
cant number of gamers crave something
more than AAA titles that guide players
through each level with gentle encour-
agement and hand holding. If it rewards
them, gamers will flock to a brutal, re-
alistic and nerve-racking experience.

FILM REVIEW ,

‘House at the End of the Street’  
less  more amusing

Hannah Webb
F or The Pzftvt‘ News

“House at the End of the Street”
Starring: Jennifer Lawrence,‘
Elisabeth Shue, Max Thieriot
Directed by: Mark Tonderai
Grade: D

If you’re looking to get into a festive Halloween
spirit without subjecting yourselfto the blood
and gore that many thriller movies have to of-
fer, “House at the End of the Street” might be a
promising alternative. P

But don’t have high expectations.

Jennifer Lawrence —— most notably rec-
ognizable for her recent role in “The Hunger
Games” — stars as Elissa, an inquisitive teen
who recently moved from Chicago to a contrast-
ingly wooded suburb with her mother Sarah
(Elisabeth Shue). Sarah bought the house in
a suburban area for an unusually low price
because — surprise! — the house down the
street was once home to a happy family of four,
before the mentally unstable daughter decided
to murder her parents and immediately disap-
pear from the neighborhood.

Soon after movinginto her new home, Elissa
encounters the murderous girl’s social—outcast
brother, Ryan (Max Thieriot). Elissa, beingacu—
rious and headstrong teenager, is immediately
drawn to this mysterious young man, who de-
cided to remain in the house where his parents

were murdered. The palpable sexual tension
between Lawrence and Thieriot foreshadows

a predictable teenage love story that inevitably ‘

outshines the ﬁlm’s anticlimactic plot.

Instead of saving it up to create a later el-
ement of surprise, “House at the End of the
Street” alerts the audience to one of the plot’s
most interesting aspects within the ﬁrst half
hour of the ﬁlm: The young murderer is still alive
and livinginthe basement ofthe house while her
brother attempts to keep her existence a secret.

But the ﬁlm will elicit more laughs than
shrieks from the audience, a bad sign for the
so-called “thriller.” A steady level of unoriginal-
ity pervades the movie, from the typical high
school party scene — complete with spin the

bottle, using Mike’s Hard Lemonade containers p

—— to a shot of the mentally deranged murderer
hiding in the woods, waiting to attack an unsus-
pecting victim.

Even Oscar nominee Lawrence has a difficult

time holding the audience’s attention for the

entire ﬁlm, which consists of nothing but the
repeated clichés present in most low-budget
horror flicks. If it weren’t for Lawrence’s already
established fame and her eye—candy physique,
this ﬁlm would have been an absolute failure.
Despite screenwriter David Loucka’s attempt
to produce an edge—of—your—seat thriller, he in-

stead offers the audience aperplexing combina- '

tion of your typical high school love story with
a minimal—suspense thriller. The plot seems to
be caught between the two genres, resulting
in a confusing ﬁlm without too much bump in
the dark. I

FILM REVIEW

Hysterical film capitalizes on
nerdy choir group popularity  

Quinn Keaney
Staff Writer

“Pitch Perfect” _

Directed by: Jason Moore
Starring: Anna . Kendrick, Brittany
Snow, Rebel Wilson ’
Grade: B+

In a world obsessed with talent competitions
and live performances, “Pitch Perfect” is
the perfect answer for anyone who has been
longing for a version of “Glee” with a little
more bite.

Snarky and sarcastic but with a whole
lot of heart, “Pitch Perfect” is a high—energy
comedy set in the dog-eat—dog world of com-
petitive collegiate a cappella groups. While
it spends a good deal of time making fun of
the “aca-people,” they’re the very ones with
whom the audience ends up falling in love by

the time the credits roll. It’s predictable and V
. 99tra:g*s9u%=.b:1E its also. I2r9b?tl?1>r tlzsmost

’ .4.-is ..as..u_.'-..a-a'...-;...  ad-V‘ , .-—-

ﬁm you’ll have at the movies this fall. Just give
in and let your inner show-choir nerd free.

Jason Moore makes his directorial debut
alongside writer Kay Cannon, who adapted
his work from the nonﬁction book by Mickey
Rapkin, “Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Colle-
giate A Cappella Glory.” The result is a some-
how nerdier, signiﬁcantly more hilarious mix
of “Glee” and “The Breakfast Club.” While ev-
eryone ends up setting aside their differenc-
es and coming together to the sound of the
eclectic soundtrack, which ranges in genre
from The Bangles and Simple Minds to David
Guetta and Bruno Mars, the cheese factor is
minimized by the stellar performances each
actor contributes.

The ﬁlm opens with Beca (Anna Kend- ,

rick), an alternative, antisocial D], aspiring
music producer and college freshman. Gone
is the usual high-strung, perma—srniling on-
screen persona that Kendrick tends to act,
and in its place is a girl as heavy on the sar-

casm as she is on her dark eyeliner.

While the role is a nice departure from her
typical character, Kendrick doesn’t remain
too sullen for long, letting her truly talented
vocal chords out to play and her smart likabil—
ity to eventually take center stage.

Beca ends up joining the Barden Univer-
sity Bellas along with a few other misﬁts, all

   

g. of whom are expected to dress like ’60s-era
ﬂight attendants and follow a Very strict set of

rules. Leading the Bellas is the harsh and over-
bearing Aubrey (Anna Camp) and her ﬂirty,
nicer counterpart Chloe (Brittany Snow).

The most important rule of all? Never, un-
der any circumstance, engage in a romantic
tryst with a member of the Barden Treble-
makers, the all—male a cappella group at the
school and the Bellas’ No. 1 rival for the na-
tional championship. Beca’s dedication to
the Bellas is tested when she begins to fall for
Treblemaker and nice guyrjesse (Skylar As-

’ tin), a Dane Cook look-alike with the voice of

an angel.

As the competition for the national cham-
pionship looms closer, Beca puts her Djing
skills to the test and shakes up the Bellas’
normal, somewhat tired routine with a few
of her own mashups. With her help, the Bellas
have a ﬁghting chance against the spectacular
Treblemakers.

The ﬁlm is just the right amount of fun
and funny, with ridiculous supporting per-
formances from Rebel Wilson, a breakout
star from last year’s “Bridesmaids” whose
character nicknames herself “Fat Amy” and
who delivers some of the ﬁ1m’s best — and
raunchiest —- lines. And Hana Mae Lee, who
also manages to steal a few scenes of her own
as Lilly, a character with a quietly quirky and
odd demeanor. John Michael Higgins and
Elizabeth Banks — also a producer on the

ﬁlm — provide notable additions to the cast ‘Z

as the broadcast team at the a cappella com-
petitions, doling out line after line of inane,
crude and side—splitting, ad—libbed commen-
tary.
‘ itch Perfect” is an irresistible romp that
will have you singing along to performances
ofjessie ]’s “Price Tag,” Miley Cyrus’ “Party in
the USA” and F10 Rida’s “Right Round” in no
time. Prepare to get pitch slapped, %

LUPE

Lupe who wasn’t happy with the government,

 

' 2 wanted peace on earth and used his giﬁed lyri-

cism as an outlet for his ﬁustration.

Pushing along, Lupe released the album’s
second single, titled “B*tch Bad.” As one of the
leading socially conscious hip-hop emcees in
today’s rap game, Lupe took it upon himselfto

, . discuss the mistreatment of women in today’s

society. “Bitch bad, women good / Lady better,
they misunderstood,” Lupe says in the tracks
chorus, seemingly tryingto act as the role model
he believes is missing from rap.

This brings us to the highly anticipated re-
lease ofLupe Fiasco’s Food c’9’Ijqu0rH: The Great

American  Pt. 7 in full form.

. “Blood, sweat and tears, police batons / Gas
masks and  create graffiti on corners /
Murals that salute freedom or death for liberty,”
Ayeshajaco raps in the album’s introduction,
“Ayesha Says.” The intro covers everythingfrom
the violence in the West Bank to the Trayvon
Martin case. It might not be Lupe’s voice, but
this is the Lupe style thatlisteners have grown
accustomed to, and for the ﬁrst time in a long
time, things were off to the right start.

The album’s next track, “Strange Fruition,”
serves as aforum for Lupe to voice his opinion.
Confusion, strife and sorrow hang over the song
like a rain cloud, ominous and ready to strike
as he laments over the state of America, the rap
game and everything in between. “That’s why
my sounds are sermons that’s so full of wrath /

Baptize your mind let your brain take a ba ,”
Lupe says, urging the people to join him as he
attempts to reclaim his world. Two tracks into
the album, and we’re still OK.

Then we reach the track titled “Battle Scars.”
Featuring singer Guy Sebastian, the track is
more reminiscent of a pop break-up songthan
anything Lupe seems to be striving for. It’s out
of place and not his style. Simply put, the track
doesn’tbelong on the album. “The wound heals,
but it never does / That’s' ’cause you’re at war
with love,” Lupe says. This is the track where
Lupe descends from the pulpit and turns the
dial to Kiss FM. .

The remainder of the 16—'track album tries
to regain the steam created in the album’s be-
ginning, but it fails to pick up where it left off.
Tracks like “Audubon Ballroom” continue the

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

    

trend, sampling The Game’s “My Life” instead
of following suit with earlier tracks such as
“Around My Way” and using beats from hip-
hop’s Golden Age.

Maybe he should have had a shorter track
list. Maybe the record company managed to
get its way once again in hopes of producing
something more mainstream. Whatever it is,
it isn’t Lupe, and even the album’s well—done
outro “Hood Now” can’t save the day.

Ewen the album cover harkens to the dark
themes of its contents, which focus on the
struggles of our times. Both sides of the jewel
case, as well as the album itself, are all black.
It’s as if Lupe is giving one last deﬁant blowthis
archnemeses — big record companies.

Unforttmately, it seems that the battle is one
he simply can’t win. I 2

While Charlie is intoxicated at aparty, he lets
slip to Sam that his best friend killed himselflast
May and also accidentally discovers Patrick’s re-
lationship with the high school quarterback. The
inforr/nation only brings the friends closer to-
gether, and soon the three become inseparable.

The ﬁlm takes place sometime in the late
’80s or early ’90s. N 0 one has a cell phone, and
everyone is listening to cassette tapes, which
would be admittedly cooler on screen if recent
trends weren’t emulating ’90s style so much.

The soundtrack is undeniably good. We hear
David Bowie, The Smiths, New Order and other
quintessential artists of those decades’, Music
weaves the movie’s scenes together as the char-
acters constantly search for the perfect song for
that rnixtape or exactly what to listen to as they
pretend to ﬂy through the tunnel while standing
in the back of a pickup truck.

While this movie isn’t doing anything inno-
vative, it also isn’t contrived. It’s familiar, but it

' avoids feeling like another after—school special.

MEWS SOCCER _
Nonconference undefeated streak

snapped by Navy

Andrew Stern
Staff Wrz'ter

Still off to its best start since
1986 only a week ago, the Pitt
men’s soccer team seems to be
watching its early season mo-
mentum evaporate.

After recording its first loss
ofthe season 1-0 to conference
foe Cincinnati on Saturday, Pitt
lost another on Tuesday night
to Navy, 3-1.

Head coach Joe Luxbacher
rued his team’s poor decision-

‘making in the defeat.

“We made a bunch of bad
decisions tonight, and it really
cost us. We need to play smarter
and make better decisions in
our own half,” Luxbacher said.

Pitt (6-2-2) opened up the
scoring early with a free kick.
CaptainJohn Cordier drove into
the box a perfect ball that Alex
Harrison knifed out of the air,
heading it into the back of the
net just 10 minutes into the
match.

The Panthers couldn’t build
on their initial success in the
attacking third. They were out-

shot 21-7, and Navy goalkeeper
Gavin Snyder only had to make
one save all game.

It didn’t take long for Navy
(5-2-1) to tie the score. In the
22nd minute, junior Alex Wilson
received a beautiful pass from
teammatejoseph Greenspan and
then eluded the Pitt defense to
send a shot blistering past div-
ing Pitt goalie Lee Johnston.

But unfortunately for the
Panthers, the equalizer was just
the beginning for the Midship-
men.

After Saturday’s loss to Cin-
cinnati, Cordier emphasized
the importance of securing the
backline and playing smart soc-
cer late in the halves, but Pitt
was unable to finish the half
strongly yet again.

In the 42nd minute, Navy
forward Thomas Shiiba picked
offa sloppy Pitt pass and trans-
ferred the ball to Geoff Fries.
Fries then sent a curling shot
over Johnston and into the top
part of the net.

“That was our one focus
coming out of Saturday’s loss
[to Cincinnati]. Today we once
again failed to close out the

half,” Cordier said.

After the break, Pitt showed
a little bit of life, almost scor-
ing off a volley from freshman
Nick Wysong. Wysong sent a line
drive that Graham Smith was

able to deﬂect on net, where _

Snyder calmly redirected it.
After that opportunity, Pitt
didn’t produce any more prom-
ising plays before Navy scored
its third goal of the evening.

After a Pitt surge, its backline

was caught out of position, al-
lowing Navy to counterattack.

Shiiba rocketed a shot on net
that Johnston parried. But be-
cause the defense hadn’t quite
transitioned back from the
offensive zone, Navy captain
Giiehti~Christian managed to
streak through the Pitt zone,
corral the loose ball and put it
in the net in the 79th minute for
his team’s ﬁnal goal.

Pitt never threatened again.

With their nonconference
schedule now complete, the
Panthers have seven games re-
maining. They next play the No.
5 Georgetown Hoyas on Satur-
day evening at Ambrose Urbanic
Field. I

 

BARNES BURNER

No reason to fret  
about the Steelers   

Nate Barnes
Staff Wrz'ter

The Steelers will be ﬁne. J V
It might not look it, given

their 1-2 record after logsing 
34-31 to the Raiders on Sunday.
After the defeat, consternation 

continues to rise among the
members of Steeler Nation, who
had high hopes for this year’s
team. A ‘

But I think fans might_=‘bléj
jumping the proverbial gun»1iere,»..- -

as there are still 13 games left to

play in the season. And if last‘_
year’s proceedings offer any in-

dication, the Steelers will really
start to put things together after
their current bye week.

Granted, the Steelers prob-
ably shouldn’t have lost tothe
Raiders. Pittsburgh shot itself in
the foot with the two lost fumbles
— one of which occurred during
an offensive drive toward the
end of the fourth quarter that,
if completed, would’ve sealed
the game. Unfortunately for the
Steelers, the Raiders scored 13
unanswered points in the quar-
ter to win their first game of the
year in dramatic fashion.

But that lossis in thepast. It
isn’t easy for fans or players to

swallow, but the team will learn .

from it, as the Steelers always
seem to do.

Anyway, back to the point
here. The Steelers will be fine. .

Bear in. mind, the Steelers
have played without two of their
best defensive players and one of
the league’s best running backs
for the better part of the month.
Linebackerjames Harrison and
running back Rashard Menden-
hall have yet to play, and safety
Troy Polamalu has missed the
past two games after starting
in the season opener against
Denver.

Mendenhall’s return will
boost the performance of one of
the league’s worst rushing units
statistically — currently No. 30
in yards with only 195 yards on
74 carries thus far. Although the
offensive line will not improve,
Mendenhall’s power and speed

‘jibe a huge upgrade. overli

will bring a new element’-to the
Steelers’ running game" thatno

Woodley. Although Harrisdifs
production has declined slightly
over the past few years, 
credible strength often pushees
opposing tackles back into lie
quarterback, collapsing"the

‘ pocket and bringing more ver-

satility to the defense. V

The same can be said for Troy
Polamalu, especiall  tip-
grade ovef5"(;l_i’y§i M _,  Like
Harrison, Polamalu is in the
declining years of his career but
is still one of the league’s elite
safeties.

With both Harrison and Pola-
malu in the lineup, the holes in
the Steelers defense will disap-
pear. .

Fans should also remember
that the Steelers generally take
a few weeks at the beginning of
each season to round into the
kind of team they are expected
to be. This progression is pretty
natural, since teams only really
find out what works and what
doesn’t once they start playing
games that matter, i.e., games in
the regular season.

That said, how about that Ben
Roethlisberger guy?

Big Ben already appears to
be in full form, having thrown
for 904 yards and a league-lead-
ing eight touchdown passes in
just three games. He has also
completed 68.3 percent of his
passes, earning himself a quar-
terback rating of 109.2, the
second—best mark in the entire
league.

On the other end of the pass-
ing game, Pittsburgh’s receiving
corps have also played impres-
sively over the course of the
team’s first three games.

FROM PITT TO PROS

Pitt in the NFL: Fitzgerald’s performance lone bright spot

Larry Fitzgerald became the youngest
NFL player to reach 700 ‘receptions on

Sunday. MCT Campus 1

Sean Corrado
Staff Writer

Former Panther Larry Fitzgerald ﬁnally
broke out in Week 3 after two mediocre
games, but he was the only player to
make Pitt proud last Sunday.

Most other notable Pitt alums cur-
rently in the National Football League
struggled in their games this past week-
end. In addition to Fitzgerald’s success,
a season—ending injury and a benching
highlighted an eventful Sunday for the
18 former Panthers in the NFL.

The Arizona Cardinals’ Fitzgerald
(Pitt 2002-2003) lit up the field with
114 yards in an impressive 27-6 win over
the Philadelphia Eagles. He scored on a
37-yard catch and run from Kevin Kolb

' to give Arizona a 17-point lead midway

through the second quarter.

Shortly after, Kolb hit Fitzgerald
with a‘ four-yard pass to give Larry the
700th reception of his career. He be-
came the youngest player in NFL his-
tory ——29 years and 23 days old .—- to
reach that mark. The second youngest,
Jason Witten, achieved the mark at 30
years and 133 days old. Fitzgerald will

likely continue to dominate next week
when the Cardinals take on Miami and
its subpar secondary.

As for the other Panther alumni, the

fweekend just didn’t work out in their
?favor.
S The New York Jets received bad news
upon learning that Darrelle Revis will
‘need to undergo season-ending surgery
on his left knee after he tore his ACL in
the third quarter against the Dolphins.

Revis (Pitt 2004-2006) left the game

after his knee buckled in the grass as
he tried to tackle Daniel Thomas off a
screen pass. He will undergo surgery in
a few weeks and is expected to need six
to nine months of recovery time.

With the loss of Revis, New York’s _

playoff chances have been cut nearly in
half. Considered the best cornerback in
the league, he only allowed one touch-
down in all of 2011. Since the Aliquip—
pa, Pa., native joined the team, the Jets
have never intercepted a pass without
him on the field. Kyle Wilson will now
start in his place.

LeSean McCoy (Pitt 2007-2008)
couldn’t get it going against the Arizona
defense. He ran for just 70 yards on 13
carries in the team’s loss to Fitzgerald’s

Cardinals.

Dion Lewis (Pitt 2009-2010) seems
to have lost his job as McCoy’s backup.
He was a healthy scratch on Sunday —
meaning he didn’t dress —— with Bryce
Brown now occupying second string on
the depth chart. Lewis —— if he sees the
field — and McCoy will look to improve
the Eagles’ offense against the defend-
ing champion New York Giants next
weekend.

Many fantasy football owners ex-
pected jon Baldwin (Pitt 2008-2010)
to have a breakout season this year,
yet he only saw four of Kansas City
Chiefs quarterback Matt Casse1’s 44
passes thrown his way in the team’s win
against the Saints. Baldwin only has 98
yards this season on six catches, with
Dwayne Bowe seeing most of the action
for the Chiefs.

San Francisco punter Andy Lee (Pitt
2000-2004) had three punts for the
49ers but only landed one inside the

20-yard line. He did, however, man-'

age to average 48.7 net yards per kick
— the difference of yards traveled and
yards returned —- his highest total this
season. j

BARNES

The slid play of Steelers’ quaterba Ben Roethiisherger should reassure fans that

there is no need to panic about the team’s prospects. MCT Campus

Brown, Emmanuel Sanders and Jerricho
Cotchery might make up the fastest, most
versatile and overall best group of receiv-
ers in the NFL. Brown has already racked

up 240 yards on 18 receptions, and Wal— V
lace has put up 234 yards on 17 catches of v
his own. Each of these four players acts »

as a threat to the end zone any time he
touches the ball.

Not to mention Heath Miller — who
broke out with 8 catches for 60 yards and
two touchdowns — and Leonard Pope at
the tight end spots.

So, yes, I think this team will do well

lieved at the beginning of this season the
Steelers would win 11 games this year, and
these first three haven’t done anything to
change that belief, especially consider:
ing the team played without three of its
primary contributors.

And I fully expect Pittsburgh to handle
Philadelphia without too much difficulty
this weekend. Quite frankly, this is an
Eagles team that really should be 0-3 af~
ter the team’s atrocious showing against
Cleveland and surprising close-call win
over Baltimore in Week 2.

The Steelers are going to be just ﬁne.
