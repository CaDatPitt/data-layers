was written and originally pub-

the Daily Princetonia.n,'the uni-

“Our professional curiosity was

aroused when the news stories ,

broke,’ said a Dial editor, “and
we got on the phone and called
Howard Smith at the Princetoni-

they said yes, and were in our

Pi Lam Rex Tells
Of Kidnapping

Editor, The Pitt News:
Kidnapping generally makes
good copy, yet last Sunday a
University s tu d e n t disappeared
without arising the least bit of
fanfare or‘ serious concern.
The pledge class of Pi Lambda
.Phi Fraternity, directing their 35-.

» odd minds over the last six or

seven‘ weeks, succeeded "in “pull-
ing of!” one of the wildest pledge
stunts this or any campus will
see. As victim of the scheming
my sympathies most naturally lie
with the pursued, but one cannot
help but credit these nuts for
their energies and imagination.

Through the gleeful co-opera-
tion of my date on Nov. 13, I was
manipulated onto the porch of
the Pi Lam house. Here I was
greeted by six henchmen, two of
whom were versed in karati, who
proceeded to tackle, tie-up, and
tuck me into a waiting get-away
car.

With all the drama of an Eliot
Ness adventure, the pledge rep-
resentatives drove around town
pointing out the more scenic
areas of Pittsburgh to their gag-

.ged passenger. It was explained

that as Rex (president) of the
fraternity I was/ the symbol of
that group, and, therefore, the
most likely subject for their mon-
sterous plot. All attempts to re-
sign from my position failed and

that they all relaxed somewhat,
baring that crib-sheet smile that
would last until I shared the sec-
ret of just what I_ was fated for.

It is always hard to credit a
pledge class with too much san-
ity, and when your life is at

stake, this thought grows para-‘

mount. So, when I found myself
at track 21 at the Pittsburgh
train station at 12:58 a.m., board-
ing “The "Spirit of St. Louis” with
a one-way ticket, a quarter, and
a prayer, well, “my faith in: hu-
manity" was not exactly restored.

A."lette‘r I was given at the
last moment explained that the
pledge class of the Pi Lambda
Phi chapter at Washington Uni-
versity in' St. Louis would be my
new caretakers, but all later

events _were really anti-climatic, ,

for, as the letter stated, “if you
are reading this letter, then the
basic idea has worked.” St. Louis
seemed no m‘ore,concerned with
my arrival than was Pittsburgh
with my departure. Yet this kid-
napping, press coverage or no,
has and will make good copy for
the spirit and memories of a most
imaginative pledge class and a
most grateful president. ’

Dorm Leaguer
Defends Referees

Editor, The Pitt News:

In lieu of the attitudes express-
ed in Frank Smizik’s editorial
“Intramural—Not NFL,”- I think
it is necessary to clear up a few
misconceptions that the editor»ex-
hibited. _  ;

First of all, Ron Mason is not

the director of intramurals. Leo;

Bemis is the University recog.
nized head of the intramural de-
partment with Ron Mason and.
Dave Pendegast as his graduate
assistants. Secondly, it isnot the
job of these two_ assistants to ref-
eree. Rather, they are to be ﬁeld
supervisors with the primary
function of directing not offici/at,
mg. * ,
Also, it should be remembered
that these two men are in charge
of all campus intramural football.
This year they had to run six
leagues with 37 competing teams
and more than 70 games being
played. Is the sports editor aware
of the number of available ref-

erees for these games? There are
seven! Due to this shortage, Ron
and Dave were pressed into serv-
ice. '

With only one referee to a
game, it is extremely difficult .to
see every facet of the game and
to penalize every violation. From
the tone of Smizik’s editorial it
is readily apparent that he has
never officiated. one of these
games ‘-or he would have been
aware of the difficulties. .

In reference to the section deal-

ing with diving at runners, he is.

again in error. While diving is
illegal, it carries with it no pen-
alty. The tag made by the diving
player is to be disregarded. This
rule has been enforced. Smizik
goes on to state that Mason
should penalize violators and
throw out troublemakers. As a
member_of the dormitory league,
I can attest to‘ Ron's and Dave's
ability to control the game and
throw out. troublemakers.

While it is true that the offi- ~

ciating for intramural games
could be improved it is highly
unfair to blame one individual
for the entire situation. A Special

"attempts should be made by the

teams involved to help the cir-
cumstances. Team captains should
attempt to control their own men



and keep illegal play at a mini‘- P

mum.

Smizik also seems to imply
that every game is haltedeby the
call for brain surgeons‘ and am-
bulances. The intramural reports
that there have been ﬁve injuries
this season, all of them minor..

Competitive spirit runs high in.

all leagues with everyone think-

.ing his game to be “most impor-

tant.” With six “most important”
leagues to worry about these men
should not be unduly criticized.
Criticism is only valid when it
seeks to improye \a "system that
has weaknesses . While Smizik
makes a lot of generalizations in
his article, I could, not spot any
Proposed solutions to the situa-
tion.

If the sports editor or anyone
else has a solution I'm sure the,
intramural department will beg
glad to accommodate him.Before
then, let's not criticize until i we

Penn State Critic
Receives Rebuff

Editor, The Pitt News:

People who live in glass houses
like Penn State should not throw
stones at cathedrals; this imma-
ture action does not show proper
respect for one’s elder. (The Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh was found-
ed in l787, Penn State in 1855.)

Gregg’ A. Diethorn, Penn State
U., ’68, in a recent letter to The
Pitt News, expressed his ignor-
ance concerning the University’s
fraternities. He‘ delved into the
subject so deeply that he didlnot
even know the correct number of
fraternities on our campus. His
guesstimate was” poor.

Regarding Mr. Diethorn’s state-
ment that University students
< “dress and act like adolescents

rather than adults” (sic), we

should like to bring to Mr. Die-
thorn’s attention that clothes do
not make the man, though in his

case they may. .

Mr. Diethorn should realize
that Penn State’s "might” does
not necessarily make right. The
Panther prowled Saturday.

Pitt News). I-can sympathize with
them because I have gone to
school in Europe for two years
and have traveled extensively
there several- times since.

My impressions have been quite
different from these seven stu-
dents. First of\ all, those who
went to school in‘ Europe last
summer met exceptional students
—not ones who went to summer
school because they needed to
make up_a course. It is, there-
fore, natural for these students
to have “biased” impressions
when matching the average Amer-
ican student with the average
European one.

Secondly, in comparing the
European with the American, one,

one must recognize the greater ‘

selectivity of the former. About
50 per cent of American high
school students go on to college,

whereas only ﬁve per cent of

European students continue be-
yond the secondary school level.
Thus the tendency to View the
European student as more in-
tellectually-oriented than his
American counterpart is partial-
ly correct.

Yet even the European student
isn’t so “ivory - tower” - oriented.
Students in European universi-
ties don“: have constant mid-term
exams, but they take a ﬁnal at
the end of the year. I dare say that
they could match any American
in the “grind,” three weeks be-
fore their ﬁnals. The point is
that mass leisure a Pamericaine
has had an impact on the Euro-
pean student. There is just as
much travel, movies, magazines,
beer-halls and rock ’_n roll in Eur-
ope and the European students
indulges as much as his Ameri-
can counterpart.

One feature more highly insti-
tutionalized in the American uni-
versity than in the European one
is an organized outlet to civic
participation (i.e. HEP, VISTA,
Student Government, and AEO
to name a few at the University).
In the world outside the univer-
sity from which students have
been traditionally excluded (and
hence have either retreated fur-
ther from or revolted against)
this civic outlet has proved ad-
vantageous as a; springboard to
later civic involvement and as a

«channel of non-violent self-ex-

pression. It all depends, I realize,
on whether one’s ideal of a stu-
dent is intellectual, pragmatic or
a fusion of the two. But this.is a
matter of values—not self-evident
truths!

A common belief or “myt ”
which I would like to dispel is
the cause of the ‘(degradation of
the American culture in Europe.

tourist alone. but also because of
those Americans who have cloak-
ed their tourism with a guise of

nativism. These latter have per-1 .

petuated the idea of an “uncul-
tured brother” from whom they.
have rid themselves. It is prob-
ably true that most American
tourists go over with the idea:
“I’m not like the rest—I’m more
tolerant!” but their ﬁrst disgrunt-
ling experiences in going through
French customs or looking vain-
ly for a Italian taxi-driver dis-
pels any sympath or tolerance.
These “pseudo-continentals” do
a greater disservice to their
American heritage than the pro-'
verbial “obnoxious tourist”' by
disowning the latter.

This ,is not to condemn the
European student nor to praise‘
the American one, but to put-
both in a more accurate perspec-
tive. After all there is a sizeable.
segment of intellectually-orient-
ed students in the U.S. and" these
might even be rated higher than
the European segment in terms
of their technicalland profession-.
al accomplishments as well as
their “intellectual instinct” for
internationl welfare.

\ Questioned

Editor, The Pitt News:

I was amused by Marsha Rehns’
“Where Are the Wide Eyes?”

her moral have been—-—to chide
her friend Ann about not having

BPM started singing. They voiced
full-ﬂedged support when the Ma-
jority launched a medley of
songs spoofing famous events
that nearly took place and a
series of “vignettes of Ameri-
cana.”

_By BILL JEROME
The Back Porch Majority
gave the Clean-Shaven Ma-
/jority its say last Thursday,
Linthe P.M. Series concert at
the” Stephen Foster Memor-

ial, and the overflow crowd
,_ iof Clean-Shavens protested only
once: when the Back Porchers
 left the stage after their second
. encore.
 " But the conquest did not come
easily. More than one University
‘student announced skepticism at
, seeing “another folk-song group,”
'_but these same people lost their
conscientious objections once the

The Back Porchers conquered
mainly through versatility and
balance. Their most warmly-re-
ceived numbers were. of varied
types: Linda Carey’s blues solo
God Bless the Child Who Gets
His Own, the folk-rock tunes
Same Old Huckleberry Finn and
Any Place I Hang My. Hat, and
On the Wings of the Wind, which
featured Mike Crowley's out-

 

standing banjo work.

A short history of the group
clearly accounts for its vitality.
They began as a “farm team” for
the first of the big folk groups,
the New Christy Minstrels, and
soon lost three of its trainees to
the varsity. But once settled and
increased in number from ﬁve to
seven, the BPM broke» off as un-
derstudies to try and go it alone.

They have survived ratherwell,
with many television and night
club appearances to their credit,
but list college ‘concerts as their
“major occupation.” The person-
nel now includes banjoist Mike
Crowley, bassist Kin Vassy, gui-

   

tarist Denny Brooks, and unny—
man Mike Clough and girls:
Blonde Linda Carey, redhead
Karen Brian, and spunky Ellen,
Whalen. '

For all the enthusiasm that
greeted the musical numbers, the
most winning efforts were the
satires of Americana and the
medly of “songs that almost made
it.” In these moments we saw
blackouts spooﬁng the current
television commercials ((“Mar1-
boro—a man’s ciggy-poo”) and a
series of songs by the legendary
Foggy Carbuncle, commemorat-
ing events that never took place
("Congratu1ations,,President Nix-

 

   

on, ppy Anniversary, Eddie
and Liz,” “Hip, Hip, Hoorary for
the Edsel,” etc.).

The Majority is as perfectly
balanced a team—farm team or
major league—as one could hope
to ﬁnd. The guitar and banjo
work by Brooks and Crowley is
complemented by the singing
prowess and visual wow of
Misses Carey. Brian and Whalen
Kin Vassy’s slap bass and South-
ern drawl adds a ﬁrm musical
“basement,” while Mike Clough
keeps everyone laughing between
efforts to get his tongue back
into his mouth. ‘I

The Phi Sigma Sigma Sorority
is currently displaying an art ex-
hibit in the Student Union Lower
Lounge to celebrate the nationa1’s
Founders’ Day.

The exhibit, entitled “50 Years
of American Art” was assembled
by rated art critic Dr. Virgil
Parker, for distribution to all of
Phi Sigma Sigma’s local chapters.

The exhibit " is a collection of
200 prints of works by major
American artists such as Andrew
Wyeth, “Grandma Moses,” and

Jackson Pollock. Besides collect-

ing the works, Parker has pro-
vided a commentary upon them
which is available to all visitors
at the show. Works included in
the exhibit date from the 1910's to
the present and are grouped into
ten-year periods. The year 1910
was chosen as a point of de-
parture by Parker because three
years later a revolutionary group
of American artisits, The Asso-
ciation of American Painters and
Sculptors, organized the Armory

opposed by the conservative cul-'

tural community of the time.
However, the Armory S ho w
broke the ice for these new tech-
niques,_ which soon made their
inﬂuence felt . throughout the
country and fostered “an artistic
explosion.”

Alumni Respond To Questionnaire
On Parental Occupation, Income

The majority of the stu-
dents, who receive bachelor’s
degrees from the University
come from families whose

,. income is below $9,000 a year
a survey, conducted by the
Office of Planning and General
Affairs revealed. More than 30
per , cent of the students who re-
plied listed their fathers’ occupa-
tion as craftsman, semi-skilled or
unskilled laborer, and that more
than 75 per cent of the students

fathers were “professionals,” four
per cent, semi-professionals; 23.7
per cent, manageral; 6.9 per cent,
clerical; 7.5 per cent, sales; 4.8
per cent service (including occu-
pations such as bus driver, beau-

_ tician, shoemakers, policeman);

13.9 per cent, craftsman or skilled
laborer; and 18.2 per cent, semi-
skilled or unskilled laborer. .
Of 982 graduates who respond-
ed to the question on the highest
education level attained by their
fathers, 1.8 per cent said that

/

are advancing their education be-
yond the level of their fathers.
Since April of 1962, the »Uni-
versity has been sending ques-
tionnaires'to all graduates of the
schools of liberal arts, engineer-
ing, business, education, pharma-
cy and nursing. Thus far, 1,043
graduates have responded and
the sampling is considered to be
representative of all graduates.
The University plans to continue
the program with each succeed-
ing group of graduating seniors.
‘ Of 893 graduates who answer-'
ed the question on family income
(the question was not asked one 0
year), the distribution ’ was as ’
follows: 3.5 per cent indicated a
family income below $3,000, 24.9
per cent between $3,000 and $6,-

$9,000 and $12,000, 10 per cent

 Soccer1nen’s Hopes

Sports Editor

“ACTION SPEAKS LOUDER THAN _WORDS”

The Athletic "Committee is starting to act. A meeting
was held on Monday; to decide the status of John Michelosen.
Frank Carver told, everyone that it '-was a friendly meeting
and that no decision has been made and won’t be made for
possibly two weeks. ‘

The committee consisted of acting Chancellor Dr. Stan-
ton Crawford, Frank Carver and Dr. Paul Masoner, chair-
men of the Athletic Committee and Dean of the School of

4 Education. This is the first time that ‘=Miche1osen has met

with the group. _ _

The purpose of the meeting was to cover the entire foot-
ball program, including the coaching. There will be another
meeting the near future, which should tell us more about
changes in personnel. _ _

The committee knows that there is something wrong
with Pitt football, as everyone does.'We only hope that a de-
cision is made quickly for the good of the football program.

It was a shame that the spirit of the soccerlteam wasn’t
enough to carry them through the ﬁrst round in their game
against East Stroudsburg. ‘They had plenty of opportunities
to score but they just couldn’t seem to put the ball past the

oalies. ’
g The game was played under the worst conditions pos-
sible and the ball handling on the part of both. teams was
hampered severely. A lot of credit should be given to Leo
Bemis for his ﬁne recruiting in putting this team together,
/and for keeping the teams spirit up throughout the season.

The soccer team went a long way without a good shoot— ,

gver. They had a lot of talent, but not enough scoring punch.

The varsity vs. freshmen basketball game showed two
things. One that Tim Grgurich has done an excellent job
both recruiting and coaching, and that the varsity will have
_to hustle more if they hope to win. _

The varsity has the shooters but they _don’t have the
rebounders and only Larry Szykowny showed he can con-
sistently steal the ball and make the team go. Ken Bollens
and Jim Lalley will have to show more rebounding

Booters Bow To Stroudsburg, 2 - O    

By GEORGE LIES

On a Pitt Stadium ﬁeld better suited to make
m'ud pies than play soccer, East Stroudsburg State
College dropped the blooters, 2-0, in the ﬁrst round
of the National Collegiate Soccer Championship.
Thi's:‘enabled East Stroudsburg to meet Michigan
State in the regionals while the soccermen packed
their gear and hung up the “Wait until next year”
sign. ‘

Nothing in the ﬁrst half indicated the game
would end with a winner. This was because of
the M-U-D. Players on each team soon learned

that to kick the ball meant also to dig two feet

of turf out of the ground.

Players continually overran balls, but still in
the ﬁrst half each team managed to threaten. Half-
back Vince Bartolla,» who later in the game in-
jured his left foot, shot twice from 15 yards and
almost booted the ball by the Warriors’ senior
goaltender John Petronis. Bartolotta and Sal Ta-
vares on a series of shots, again came a hair away
from scoring early in the second quarter.

After those two surges, the bo/oters found trou-
ble putting together a solid attack. Themain rea-
son was East Stroudsburg’s number eight, Rich
Flaherty. V

Twice Flaherty took clear shots _at goalie Lou

Cepanec and twice Cepanec sprawled to save sure.

goals. For Cepanec, this game was a new experi-
ence. The Warriors took more pot-shots at him
than did any team previously. .

In what could be cited as a psychological move,
the soccermen discarded their mud-singed blue-
gold shirts ‘for clean (for a while) shirts when
they reappeared for the ‘third period. As it turned
out, even this’ couldn"t help the hooters who fail-

ed to score on the best of opportunities.
The ﬁrst Stroudsburg goal resulted from Art‘
Richardson’s over-running of a ball near his own

goal. Flaherty, who seemed to cover the entire

playing ﬁeld, dug the ball from the slush, drib-
bled towards the nets, and cleanly shot past Ce-"
panec. Flaherty, assisted by left winger Jim Len- - .
nox, also scored the insurance goal in the fourth‘ __ _;
quarter. '

The other contributing factor to the soccer
team's dilemma was East Stroudsburg’s coach John
Eiler. In this game, he used three diﬂerent offenses. - -:
He started with the standard “W” formation, and ‘d 5
then he switched to a “2-3” alignment. In between 
those, he tried a. “Box 4” with one player roving, _ ~
around the middle. .

On defense, Eiler prefers to use only two full- .
backs where coach Leo Bemis utilizes three. “When
you have speedy fullbacks, you can use three,” 
and bring the halfbacks upon offense,” Eiler said. — "

“Since we lost two good ” fullbacks -through
graduation, I altered the defensive structure," con-
tinued Eiler; “Now I use two fullbacks in the mid-
dle while I have two halfbacks covering on the
outside.” ‘ 1.

In a pre-game interview, Bemis saw Eiler’s use

 

  

   
    
    
 
   
   
   
  
  
 

team. Bemis felt his wings could easily penetrate ,
Stroudsburg’s defenses. He proved correct, but
for the fact that his wings couldn’t put the ball 
into the nets once they did break through.. 

Approximately 250 of the 700 people who purb ‘
chased tickets showed for the game which was
played on a school day, during bad weather on a”
muddy field. For the hooters, it seemed nouungl
worked right. - . » —

With 2:57 remaining in Monday’s Varsity-Freshman basketball game, varsity

guard Larry Saykowny left the game with four personal fouls.
Szykowny reenter ed the game, the varsity leading 66-62. Two
ty to a 72-66 victory over the Fresh in

Robert Timmons. All Szykowny did was score sixteen

utes and contributed steals, six
in the second half.

It wasn’t quite as easy as it
sounds, though, because the frosh
led the hoopsters until midway
through the second half. With
8:57 remaining.

Nick Generalovich stole the
ball from Tony DeLisio at mid-
court and drove unmolested for
the basket, putting the varsity
in front to stay, 47-47. Following
a basket by Bob Lov_ett and two
four shots by Ken Bollens, the
Panthers had a ﬁve point lead
they never relinquished.

Two other big factors in the
win were Bob Lovett and the
varsity’s foul shooting Lovett to-
taled 26 points, scoring 13 in each
half.

Timmons was very pleased
with Lovett’s game, but “aside
from Lovett, we’re hurting in-
side. I wasn’t too happy with
the play of the other big men-
Bollens, Jim LaValley, and Bob
Thompson. Bollens has been#bet-
ter, though.”

After the one-and-one situation
went into effect with nine min-
utes remaining, the varsity didn’t
miss a foul shot, connecting on
12 straight.

“You can win a lot of games at
the foul line,” said Timmons.

“You’ve got to shoot at least 75
per cent.” The Panthers shot 72
per cent (18-25).

satisﬁed. I thought we could win,
and I thought we were going to.
All the moral victories in the
world can’t make up for one loss.
But you have to remember, we
were playing against boys with
three or four years of experi-
ence.

“Larry’s smart. He was killing
us. They put pressure on us.
We’ve got to work on it.”

The coach also pointed out that
the guards wanted to run and
could win, and I thought we were
dribbling too much and in the sec-
ond half the team wasn’t getting
the ball to the inside men. Two
guards, Tim Fisher and Dave
Welty, were also working under
the onus of four personal fouls.

Three frosh hit doubles ﬁgures
in scoring—Steve Stevenson, 15;
Len Kalata, 14; and A1 DiFris-
chia, 16. Kalata, 6-4 forward with
a long reach, also stole seven
passes. The biggest statistic,
though, was the frosh’s 18 lost
balls. .

Both teams open their season
a week from tonight against Car-
negie Tech. Unless the varsity

ﬁnds some support for Szykowny

and Lovett, it could be a long
season, especially against tall ap-
ponents. The fresh, on the other
hand, has good balance and
_should win a lot of games.

Joan MICHELOSEN shows some of the tension that he felt during
the second half of the Penn State game. He must feel the same ten-
sion as the Athletic Committee ponders his fate.

Sports Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to take this oppor-
tunity, as a University alumnus
(L.A., ’51, Law, ’54) and Pitt
Letterman (Varsity Basketball
Manager, 1950-51) to commend
your recent editorial comment re-
garding the present University
football situation.

You have stated accurately and
fairly the views of many Univer-
sity alumni, including former
athletes, not to mention the views
of thousands of non-alumni Uni-
versity fans. '

I thought your analysis was
extremely well presented and I
am in complete agreement with
your recommendation. You have
said what I have been saying for
years. A complete change of the
coaching image at Pitt is needed.
John Michelosen is obviously not
able to do the job required, nor is
his staff competent to meet the
demands of major league foot-
ball coaching. /

Since it apparently takes a dis-
aster at the University before
anyone decides to do anything,
what has happened this year may
well be all for the best. However,

Wednesday, November 24, 1965 — THE PIT!‘ NEWS — Page 11

I‘ University Grad Backs Paper’s Stand on Coach

the hour is very late, the rec-
ommendations you have called
for are absolutely essential if .to-
tal disintegration of University
athletics is to be avoided.

Therefore, I urge you through
your newspaper facility to con-
tinue the pressure. Only con-
tinued and unrelenting pressure
on the athletic director and au-
thorities will result in the desired
change.

If you ease the editorial pres-
sure, there is the very real dang-
er that the authorities may try
to sweep this season under the
rug and somehow rationalize the
disgraceful and degrading defeats
the University has endured this
season.

Incidentally, your analysis and
recommendations with regard to
football are also applicable to the
basketball situation, only more
so. The same situation prevails
there too, and the University will
never be a consistent winner in
basketball unless a complete
change in basketball coaching is
made. \ .

Please accept my thanks for
your editorial. Thousands of alum-

Pansies Meet Lawmen For Crown;

Frat Volleyball, Ping Pong Decided

Intramural football action
comes to a climax this week
as the Law School Lions
meet the defending cham-
pion Pansies for the All-
Campus title. Fraternity volley-
ball and ping pong tournaments
have also been concluded.

The Lions of the Professional
League reached the football ﬁ-
nals by defeating All-Fraternity
champ Theta Chi, 24-6, behind
the quarterbacking of Bob Hecht.
The Law School men grabbed an
early 8-0 lead as Hecht passed
four yards to Gene Julian and

Yale Gutnick ran for two extra »

points. Theta Chi drew to within
two, 8-6, but another Hecht to

.Julian score ended that threat.

Andy Connor took a two yard ﬂip
for the third score in the fourth
period. Bob Cohen and Ronnie
Heiman, defensive backs, led the
winners’ defense.

The Pansies victimized Haw-
thorne House, Dorm League
champs, 20-0, in their semi-ﬁnal
pairing. Jim Heath snared a 15
yard pass from Scott Grant in
the ﬁrst quarter, and that narrow
margin held up until Tom Henitf
caught a 50, yarder ‘from Heath
in the fourth period. Lee Hall
added insurance points, scoring
later that period on, a, ﬁve yard
pass from Grant.

Zeta Beta Tau grabbed the IFC
“B” titles in both volleyball’ and
ping’ pong, while Phi Epsilon Pi
and Pi Lambda Phi met in the-
“A” ﬁnals of both and‘ split the

honors. Phi Ep won the volley-
ball championship and Pi Lam
took the ping pong crown.

The Zeeb’s survived a second
round threat by Theta Chi on the
way to their volleyball victory.
Theta Chi won the ﬁrst game, 16-
14, but ZBT took the next two,
15-6 and 6-5, in .a time shortened
playoff. The Zeek’s'eas.il_v defeat-
ed Phi Gamma Delta, 15-8 and
15-9, in the first round and top-
ped Delta Iota ‘Delta, 15-4 and
15-13, in the league champion-
ships.

The DlD’s reached the ﬁnals‘

by stopping Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and Pi Kappa Alpha in -the ﬁrst
two rounds. The PiKA’s’swamped
Theta Chi, 15-6 and 15-2, for
third place in the standings.

Phi Ep, too, found some sec-

ond round diﬁiculties after ad-
vancing because of a ﬁrst round
bye. Delta Tau Delta defeated
the defending champs, 14-12, in

‘ the ﬁrst game, but Phi Ep took

the series, winning 15-2 and 5-3.
The winners had’ an‘ easier time
in the ﬁnals, dropping Pi Lambda

Phi,» 15-8 and 15-7.

In ping pong competition, each
team enters two singles players
and a doubles team. If both sin-
gles players win, the match is
over. But if they split their games
with the opposition, the series is
decided by a doubles match.

In the “A” league, Phi Ep and
Pi Lam each had’ﬁrst round byes.
In the second round, Phi Ep de-
feated Sigma Chi, who had beat-
en champion Delta Sigma Phi,
and Pi Lam beat Sigma Alpha
Mu. ’

ZBT’s duo of Henry Weiss and
Stuart Lowenthal stormed to
three straight 2-0 victories. Phi
Gamma Delta defeated Phi Kap.
