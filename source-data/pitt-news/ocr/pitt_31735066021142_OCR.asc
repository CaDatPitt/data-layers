Pitt's SHRP dean asked to resign

3 By Jenifer Crook

Staff Writer

The resignation ofjerome Mar-
tin, dean of the University of Pitt-
burgh’s School of Health Related
Professions, has been called for
by Thomas Detre, senior vice
president of Medical and Health
Sciences. _

In a letter to the faculty and staff

- of SHRP, Detre said that the ad-

ministrative change will ”further
the development of the academ-
ic program of SHRP and will lead

to a closer relationship between
the faculty of the school and the
clinical activities of the universi-
ty medical center.”

In a recent University Times ar-
ticle, Detre was quoted as saying
that the SH RP needs an ”academ-
ic, robust leader who has con-
siderable experience in research.

”Martin has done a good job of
moving the school forward in
many areas, but an academic
researcher should take his place,”
added Detre.

Both Detre and Martin refused

to comment to The Pitt News.
Martin became a tenured phys-
ical therapy professor in 1969. In
1976, he was appointed chair-
man of Pitt's physical therapy
department, and in 1980, he was
named assistant to the chancellor.
He became dean of SHRP in

‘I983.

Martin has a master's degree in
physical therapy from Boston
University and a doctorate in ad-
ministration from the University
of Pittsburgh.

Greenpeace rallies

against whaling

By Mike Hudson
Staff Writer

Members of Greenpeace held
an anti—whaling demonstration
Monday in front of the Oakland
Burger King on Fifth Avenue in
an effort to stop the restaurant
from purchasing fish products
from Iceland.

Greenpeace, an organization
that is opposed to whaling by
Iceland, is urging the public to
boycott the fish served in several
restaurant chains that hold con-
tracts with Iceland.

According to Lee Mittermann,
regional organizer of the lcelan-
dic fish boycott for Greenpeace,
Iceland is killing whales under a
”research program” and selling
the meat commercially to Japan

_ for food items.

”Burger King is investing in a
dirty country right now,” Mitter-
mann said. ’’If we get [Burger
King] and Wendy's to cancel their
contracts soon, Iceland won't go
whaling in June when their sea-

son starts.”

The manager on duty at Burg-
er King declined to comment
when asked about the.restaur—
ant’s position on the Greenpeace
campaign.

Pittsburgh was one stop in a
seven—city tour being conducted
by seven Greenpeace members
who are hoping to raise public
and corporate awareness of
Iceland's whaling practice.

So far, Long John Silvers, Red
Lobster, Shoney’s and Captain
D's restaurants have joined the
Greenpeace boycott.

Steven Rau, a University of
Pittsburgh graduate student who
participated in the protest, be-
lieves that it's wasteful to kill
whales and use such a small por-
tion of the meat.

”What’s happening is wrong.
It's not necessary I hope
[Greenpeace] is successful,” Rau
said.

Greek Week con tinues

with Olympiad games

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

Students strolling by the
Cathedral lawn Sunday afternoon
may have seen Pitt fraternity or
sorority members
watermelons around with
brooms.

Or maybe they witnessed the
transformation of Pitt Greeks into
a human cake right before their
very eyes — complete with the
necessary ingredients —— milk,
eggs, flour, sugar and whipped
cream.

But don't worry, the Greeks at
Pitt haven't gone crazy. They
were participating in the Greek
Olympiad. -

The Greek Olympiad is one of
many Greek Week events that are
taking place this week.

Although many of the Greek
Week events strive to raise
money for Special Olympics, en-
joyment is the main purpose of
the Greek Olympiad.

”This event is a spirit booster
to get people excited about
Greek Week. It's for everyone to
just get together and have fun,”
said Greek Week Chairwoman
Kristen Puntureri.

”We wanted to see the'Greeks
come together, make some
friends, and just have a general
good time," said Joe Kifer, Olym-
piad chairman.

pushing,

”It’s just clean, fun competition
between the different houses,”
added Samantha Pyzola, Olym-
piad chairwoman.

Although the weather was a lit-
tle chilly and drizzly, the Pitt
Greeks’ spirits were not at all
dampened.

”The support was fantastic,”
said Kifer. ”We had more people
than we ever expected here. It
was great.”

The Olympiad was divided
into two parts. The field events
took place Sunday afternoon,
while the water sports were held
last night at Trees Hall pool.

Six teams competed in the field
games on Sunday. Each team,
which was called a ”match
group," consisted of six members
from different fraternities and
sororities. Four members of each
team competed in the field
events, while the remaining two
members participated in the
water sports.

Although the Olympiad’s
primary purpose was enjoyment,
a competitive factor was in-
volved. Each year, Pitt's fraterni-
ties and sororities compete to be
named the ’’overall Greek Week
champions.”

Greek Week's winners are de-
termined by a point system, said
Chairman Ron Bizick.

Points are awarded for both

Club announces appeal of America's Cup ruling

SAN DIEGO (AP) ~— The San
Diego Yacht Club announced
Monday it will appeal a New
York judge's ruling which forfeits
the America's Cup to defeated
New Zealand challenger Michael
Fay.

The nine-member SDYC board
voted unanimously to take up the
appeal following Saturday's
recommendation by its organiz-
er, the America's Cup Organizing
Committee.

Pending the New York court's
final orders of its ruling Tuesday

disqualifying the SDYC’s catama— ‘

ran defense against Fay’s mono-
hull sloop, the America's Cup
will remain in San Diego's hands.

New York Supreme Court
Judge Carmen Ciparick’s ruling in
favor of Fay, a New Zealand mer-
chant banker, said the yacht
club's unprecedented catamaran
defense was illegal under the
Deed of Gift, a 102-year-old
document which governs Ameri-
ca’s Cup matches.

Dennis Conner skippered the
yacht club's 60-foot catamaran,

sloop in the best of three Cup ser-
ies off San Diego last September.

The New York court, which
serves as arbiter of America’? Cup
disputes, ruled that use of the
two-hulled catamaran created a
gross mismatch and violated the
spirit of the Deed of Gift.

Police officer sues
over Rosenblum case

(AP) — A suburban Pittsburgh
police officer who says he was
fired for making statements criti-
cal of a missing person investiga-
tion has filed suit in federal court,
claiming his free speech rights
were violated and his career
damaged.

George Galovich, 31, sued
former Baldwin police Chief Aldo
Caburri, Baldwin Mayor Samuel
McPherson, Lt. James Muse and
the borough.

Galovich was fired from the
Baldwin police force in April

1988, allegedly over his mishan-
dling of a bad—check investiga-
tion. He was reinstated by the
Baldwin Civil Service Commis-
sion last October.

In his lawsuit, filed Thursday in
US. District Court in Pittsburgh,
the seven—year veteran claims he
actually was fired because of in-
formation he gave investigators
from the state Attorney General’s

office in January of 1987. The  ‘mischief’.

officer said he told investigators
that Gaburri falsified records in
the investigation of the disappear-
ance of Michael Rosenblum of
Pittsburgh. ’
Rosenblum was last seen Feb.

14,_1980, and was the subject of.

the NBC—TV show Unsolved
Mysteries in January. His body
has never been found.

Coping on campus
Gallagher offers solutions for the painfully shy

I am a painfully shy person,
and it is causing many problems
in my life. What can I do about it?

Shyness is a very common trait.
It is thought that about 40 percent
of American students consider
themselves shy. Many of those
students are not unhappy with
their shyness because they have
become comfortable with their
style and find that people fre-
quently appreciate them for their
non—threatening and sincere ways
of relating to others. When shy-
ness is severe, however, it can be
crippling.

People, who, like yourself,
describe themselves as painfully
shy, often suffer from extreme
self-consciousness, have a
difficult time making friends, and
find it almost impossible to stand
up for themselves. Fortunately,
these problematic aspects of shy-
ness can be overcome. It really
does not matter whether your
shyness is genetic, as some ex-
perts claim, or learned, as others
believe. Just as a weakened limb
can be strengthened through ex-
ercise, social skills can be im-
proved with practice.

To change, however,'wil| re-

A number of people who have
overcome their shyness report
that they have developed many
techniques for practicing new be-
havior. Some practice speaking
more assertively by calling
libraries, department stores, peo-
ple who place classified ads, etc.,
to ask for information. Many
make an effort to say hello to a
certain number of new people
each week, and then gradually
begin to smile, look people in the
eye, and add a few other words
of greeting. Bank lines, doctors’
waiting rooms, bus stops — all
become practice laboratories for
these people. Others find that

staying current on politics, sports,‘

theater, etc., help to increase their
confidence in social situations.

It requires a real effort to learn
new skills and to overcome old
beliefs and attitudes, but the re-

wards in becoming more com-
fortable and skilled in social
situations are many. If you find
that you need more help than the
suggestions offered here, you
might try reading Philip Zim-
bardo’s book, Shyness, which is

.available in the Counseling

Center's Career Library and at the
Pitt Book Center. You might also
want to talk to a professional
counselor about your problem or
participate in a shyness group at
the Counseling Center.
Remember that many famous

politicians, educators, actors (and

a few psychologists I know)-

report that they, too, were once
hampered by extreme shyness.
All made up their minds to con-
quer this problem. You can also.

On Saturday, April 8, the
fifth annual ”First Ever Pitt Pro-
gram Council IOK Race” will
be run in Schenley Park.

Say what?

”The first race was called
‘The First Ever Pitt Program
Council IOK Race,’ ” said
Charlie Miller, chairman of the
PPC recreation committee.
”The next year, it was called
the second annual ’First Ever
Race,’ and the name just came
about from there.”

The race starts at noon and
begins and ends at Phipps
Conservatory in Schenley
Park. According to Miller,
most of the race will be run on
IOK jogging trails in the park,
but part of the race will be
along Overlook Drive. While
on Overlook Drive, runners
should stay to the left, facing

PPC sponsors annual

traffic for safety.

”|t’s a good thing for faculty,
staff and students to get in-
volved in,” said Dana Keefer,
the PPC program coordinator.

The Entry fee up until the
day of the race is $4 for Pitt
faculty and students, $8 for all
others. Late registration fees
are $5 and $10, respectively.

Trophies will be awarded to
the top overall male and fe-
male finishers and the top
male and female finishers in
five different age groups. All
people who run in the race
will receive a T—shirt.

Students can register for the
race in Room M-30 in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union.

’’It should be good ex-
perience for people training
for the Pittsburgh Marathon,”
said PPC Secretary Janice
Madison.

Bush strives for peace in Middle East

By Terence Hunt
AP White House Correspondent

WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi-
dent Bush, opening a week of in-
tensive talks on the Middle East,
met with Egyptian President Hos-
ni Mubarak on Monday and said
”a new atmosphere” must be
created between Israel and Arab
nations.

After more than an hour of dis-
cussion, Bush urged an end to Is-
rael’s occupation of the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, en-
dorsed the ”achievement of
Palestinian political rights” and
said a ’’properly structured” inter-
national peace conference could
play a useful role.

The tone of Bush's remarks sug-
gested the United States may at-
tempt to exert pressure for
compromise on Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who ar-
rives in the United States on
Wednesday and confers with
Bush on Thursday.

Shamir’s government has op-
posed any settlement based on
trading land for peace and has
been deeply skeptical about any

international conference.

Mubarak, standing alongside
Bush at a ceremony in the Rose
Garden, said, ”We found our-
selves in agreement on most is-
sues at stake.”

Bush did not specify whether
his administration was demand-
ing total Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank and the Gaza,
seized in the 1967 Middle East
war.
i"‘”N"di_,’,‘did- he define what he
‘meant’ by a ”properly structured”
international conference,
although a senior U.S. official
said Bush emphasized ”the key
factor of direct negotiations in
any peace process.”

U.S. policy on the occupied
territories has been to urge Israel
to trade land for peace while
leaving open the possibility of Is-
rael retaining some of the land for
security reasons.

In his talks with Bush, Mubarak
rejected Shamir’s suggestion for
elections among Palestinians to
find leaders who would negotiate
their future with Israel, according
to a senior U.S. official. Mubarak
said elections under Israeli super-

 

vision were unacceptable to the
Palestinians, the official added.

Rather than let the idea drop,
Bush asked Mubarak if other
forms of supervision would be ac-
ceptable, the official said, refus-
ing to discuss the matter further
or to be identified.

In a gesture of friendship after
the formal talks at the White
House, Bush took Mubarak to
Baltimore for the opening day of
the baseball season and a game
between the Orioles and the
Boston Red Sox. Bush left his

I guest briefly to throw out the first

ball.

Mubarak also will be the presi- I

dent's guest at a White House
dinner on Tuesday night.

The I5-month Palestinian up-
rising in the West Bank and Gaza
and Israel's tough tactics in deal-

ing with it have created pressure.
on the search for a peace set-

tlement.

”We share a sense of urgency
to move toward a comprehensive
settlement through direct negoti-
ations,” Bushsaid.

Sisterschool sends choir to Pitt PLO——

By Jim Tezak
Staff Writer

The Chamber Choir of the
University of Augsburg, West
Germany, will perform free for
the public on Wednesday, April
5 at 8 p.m. in Heinz Chapel.

The University of Augsburg is
a sister university of Pitt. Accord-
ing to Dr. Ursula Davis, the as-
sociate director of the Universtiy
West European Studies Program,
that means that there are ”very
close ties between different
departments of the two univer-
sities. I

”lt’s an information exchange,
not a legal exchange,” she said.

The 40-member chamber choir
is composed of members of Augs-
burg’s choirs, orchestras, vocal
ensembles, ‘chamber music
groups, folk music groups and
pop and jazz bands and is per-
forming at Heinz Chapel as part
of a national tour.

. The concert will feature selec-

tions ranging from classical to

contemporary. The group is espe-
cially well—known for its modern
interpretation and contemporary
pieces, according to Davis.

The concert at Pitt is sponsored
jointly by the University of Pitts-
burgh department of music, the
Heinz Chapel Choir, the Univer-
sity Center for West European
Studies and the Pitt Program
Council.

”Everyone’s pitching in tohelp
bring them here,” said PPC Pro-
gram Director Dana Keefer.

According to Davis, one aspect .

of the concert in Pittsburgh is
unique. While the choir is in
Pittsburgh, members will house
with faculty and members of the
Heinz Chapel Choir instead of
staying in a hotel. There will also
be a joint rehearsal of the two
choirs.

”During the whole event, the
Heinz Chapel Choir is going to
be very involved with [the Augs-
burg choir’s] stay here,” Davis
said. 4

Pitt and Augsburg have been
sister universities for 10 years,
Davis said. In the past, the rela-
tionship between the two schools
has included exchanges of stu-
dents and professors.

However, this is the first time
a group this large has come to
Pitt, according to Davis. She
thinks that it may start a new
trend between the schools.

compromise so that both sides
can win,” Bush said.

”Vio|ence can give way to di-

stand that the dialogue will offer
political gain,” he said. ”Egypt
and the United States share the
goals of security for Israel, the
end of the occupation and
achievement of Palestinian polit-
ical rights.”

Endorsing one of Mubarak’s
principal proposals, Bush said
that a ”properly structured inter-
national conference could play a
useful role at an appropriate
time.”

Circus atmosphere
pervades North trial

It's been in town for six weeks, and it has been
promised an indefinite run. It's the trial of Oliver North,
and so far, it has been full of the spectacle of the big top.

In the center ring, we have Fawn Hall bursting into
tears on the stand, sobbing for the man who, she at-
tests, has shown such tireless devotion. Over to the left,
just past the dancing bears, there is the famous illu-
sionist, attorney Brendan Sullivan, with one hand show-
ing that he is not a "potted plant,” as noted during the
congressional hearings, and with the other attempting
to unsuccessfully to subpoena Ronald Reagan.

To the right, we have Robert McFarlane’s amazing,
ever-changing testimony. Also, Adolfo Calero, of the
crowd—pleasing Contras: ”We're going to erect a monu-
ment for [North] once we free Nicaragua.”

For those preferring more sedate proceedings, the
defense hopes to introduce videotapes ofJohn Poindex—
ter, from the 1987 hit TV broadcast of the aforemen-
tioned congressional hearings.

Drowned in a sea of theatrics, emotionalism and the
unrestrained making of motions by attorneys on both

. sides, the actual question of the guilt or innocence of

Oliver North seems to be less and less important as the
days go on.

The defense has created an extremely effective media-
legal manuevering smoke screen to surround every step
of the trial. If, by the time the smoke clears, a fair deci-
sion can actually be reached, North's defense has
definitely ensured that North's recognizability will re-
main high. Keeping a high profile helps North in many
ways — boosting his speaking fees, collecting funds
from his supporters for legal costs; the list goes on and
on.

Whether he's guilty or innocent, he's hot. And
whether convicted or not, he will remain hot. If inno-
cent, he will find himself riding the crest of the biggest

‘ media wave in the history of television, and he has al.-

ready shown his ability to exploit telogenic qualities.

If guilty, well, he'll probably get a presidential pardon,
and find himself riding the crest of the biggest media
wave...

Justice is blind, but the eyes of Americans, all focused
on one man, can accomplish wonders,

Poor old house man

Bob Vila of This Old House has been guiding the legions of do-
it-yourself home repairers for 10 years now, but he is suddenly
unemployed as a result of an executive decision by the Boston
TV station that produces the show. Apparently, Vila has been ap-
pearing in commercials too often, and this was considered a bad
reflection on PBS that would interfere with "its ability to sustain
national and local funding."

That is a nice stance to take, but a poor reward for 10 years of
loyal service, and not that wise either. Any difficulties arising from
Vila’s appearance in commercials are infinitesimally small com-
pared to the difficulties that could be encountered if Vila decides

to go to a commercial network with his image, his experience and
his following. - »

Cheers for children's services

Cheers to television stations for
public service efforts to educate
families — children, in particular
— about the dangers of drug use.

In 1989, children are left to
learn about drugs in the same
way that they learn about every-
thing else — via the TV.

Although this is one of our so-
ciety's negative traits, television
stations are taking advantage of it
in a positive manner — to scare
kids away from drugs. And if a
child receives only one message

about drugs, I hope it is one of 1

several very effective commer-
cials that l've seen lately.

in advertisements, we've seen /

our brains on drugs represented
as an egg frying in a pan. We've
watched a lab rat eat cocaine un-
til it died. And we've heard that
”parents who use drugs have kids
who use drugs."

But among the most effective
ads are those which attempt to
expose drug pushers as slime,
and then end with the message,
”Kids, it's you against them."

In one of these, a young girl,
desperate for a cocaine fix, is
forced to go with a friend to her
dealer's house for a "party," the
implication being that the girls
will have to perform sexual favors
in exchange for drugs.

In another, a dealer has
manipulated a little boy into in-
troducing drugs to his._ school-

mates, explaining that "once they
become addicted; we'll make lots
of money." As they talk, we are
presented with foreshadowed
views of the little boy's friends —
grammar school children who
have become addicts and are
anxious to receive more drugs.
Admittedly, these are pure

 

MINDY  
BOFFEMMYER  

scare tactics. But, although some
might pose moral objections to
such an approach, I support it.
The producers of these com-
mercials might have chosen to
announce negative facts about
drugs in list form, or they might
have opted to preach against us-
ing them. But show me a child

who would have been interested‘

in that for very long. ‘These ads
definitely hold one’s»'aﬁention.
If frightening children is the

only way to keep them away

from something as harmful as

drugs, then we've got to do it.
Without this sort of horror sto-

ry, kids might only hear about the ‘

"positive" aspects of drug use —
the "high" and how "cool" it is.

Perhaps after hearing the negative’

side of the story, kids will be .

more inclined to turn away from
drugs.
The fact is that children have to
learn about drugs somewhere. If
9 parents and schools aren't provid-
ing this education, perhaps tele-
vision will beat drug dealers to
their targets. 9
Based on thelogic that children
are going to receive most of their
knowledge about drugs during a
30—second spot in between seg-
ments of Miami Vice, the televi-
sion stations are doing an
admirable job.
For a change, I've got a reason
to applaud TV. 4

Speaking out against Contra aid

"On March 18, a march down
Fifth and Forbes Avenues was
conducted by a group of univer-
sity leftists.” This broadminded
statement was the opening of a
column by Paul Kengor [The Pitt
News, March 15]. Paul is ap-
palled that these rampaging liber-
als  would oppose this "pursuit
of freedom.” He_thinks they're
confused.

Yes, Paul, the liberals are con-
fused. We can't understand how
our government could be so un-_
concerned about the basic needs
of the people of Central America.
You seem to think that the peo-
ple are grateful for our "help.”
Have you talked with anyone
from Central America? I have;
I've talked with refugees from El
Salvador and with people who
participate in relief missions to
Nicaragua. The Contras may

, want a revolution, but the people

things that you have, Paul. One
Salvadoran refugee, a highly edu-
cated woman, told me, "Please
tell your government that we
don't want their money. It's pay-
ing to kill our friends and fami-
res."  ‘

LETTERS

When I speak with people from
these countries I am ashamed,
not proud, of what my country is
doing. These people love their
homelands but cannot return.
They have, in most cases, fled for
their lives after seeing family
members murdered by the army.
They wonder if their families are
still alive and if they will ever see

their children__ again. This is not

 

liberal propaganda‘; when you

talk to these people, you can see _

the sorrow in their eyes. 

Coeli M. Hoover
CA5 '91

'[...] -

We know what the Contras a_re
tagainst, but not what they are for.
Many of their leaders were con- '

nected with the old Somoza dic-
tatorship and did not seem
particularly preoccupied with
freedom and democracy until'the
revolution kicked them out of
power in 1979. Has anyone
asked those "freedom-loving" Af-
ghan rebels Kengor isso gung-ho
about what they think about
equal rights./for women, or

Michigan wins NCAA Championship, 80-79

By Jim O'Connell

AP Basketball Writer

SEATTLE — Rumeal Robinson
made two free throws with three
seconds leftin overtime to give
Michigan its first national cham-
pionship and cap the improbable
ride of interim head coach Steve
Fisher with an 80-79 victory over
Seton Hall Monday night.

Fisher had taken over the
Michigan team just two days be-
fore the NCAA tournament began
and coached them to the six vic-
tories needed for the national
championship.

The championship game was
the fifth to go into overtime and
the first since Loyola, l|l., beat
Cincinnati 60-58 in 1963.

Glen Rice was the player who
carried Fisher and the Wolverines
to the title with 31 points in the
final, giving him an NCAAA tour-
nament record 184, breakingthe
24-year-old mark of 177 set by
Bill Bradley of Princeton.

Robinson, who finished with
21 points and 11 assists, got his
chance to be the hero when he
was fouledby Gerald Greene,
who had missed the front end of
a one-and-one with 1:17 remain-

ing and Seton Hall leading 79-76.

Terry Mills hit a turnaround
jumper with 56 seconds left to
bring the Wolverines within one.
Seton Hall worked the 45-second
shot clock down and John Mor-
ton, who finished with 35 points,
tossed up an airball with 11 se-
cond left.

Michigan brought the ball
downcourt and Robinson. began
a drive to the basket when he was
fouled before shooting. Robinson
nailed the free throws and, after
two Pirate timeouts, a final
desperation 3-pointer banged off
the glass and rim and Michigan

Wildca tswallop Pitt baseball team

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor
-The Pitt baseball team didn't
have much fun this weekend
when they traveled to Villanova
for a three—game"series.
”Wel|, let's just say it wasn't
fun,” Pitt assistant coach Larry
Wayman said. ’’I think it was just

one of those weekends. At times, A

we couldn't do anything right. It
was a tough one to swallow.”
The Panthers weren't close in
any game, losing all three by a
combined score of 40-6 (16—1,
16-2, 8-3). The losses dropped
the Panthers to 3-10 overall and
0-6 in the Big East. ‘
’’I think that Villanova is one of

man said.
them in the top 30 in the coun-
try. They are just loaded in every
capacity. They have a couple of
guys that will be top-round draft
picks this year. They have a good
system going over there.”

Pitt did get some hits during the
weekend series, but couldn't get
any in succession. That led to
their demise.

’.’Those back-to-back hits just
didn't come for us,” Wayman
said. ”Our pitching wasn't all that
bad; it just seemed that every-
thing we threw up, they were
able to hit. They found the holes
and were able to capitalize with

Rice opened the overtime with

Playoff-bound Penguins

primed for New York

(AP) — The Pittsburgh Pen-
guins, missing in action from
post-season play since 1982, are

P glad to be playing the New York

Rangers rather than Philadelphia
in their first-round NHL playoff
series that begins Wednesday.

The Penguins are happy to be
staying as far away from Philadel-
phia as they can for now, despite
winning their last two games in
The Spectrum.

’’I’d like to play the Rangers
first,” said left wing Kevin
Stevens. ”Philly is kind of an ex-
perienced team; they've been
through it all, and they've got a
tough squad. I'm not saying the

Rangers aren't a good team, but ‘

I think the whole team would
rather play the Rangers because
we've been talking about it for so.
long.” 

Coach Gene Ubriaco, well
aware of the Penguins’ 2-39-3
record in The Spectrum since
1974, agrees.

”We’d play anyone, but with
our record in that building, you
wonder about it,” he said.

The Penguins’ 6-5 overtime
victory in Philadelphia on Sunday
assured the Rangers of their third-
place Patrick Division finish and
their matchup with the sec-
ond-place Penguins.

Sunday's victory was virtually
meaningless to the Penguins, but
it gave them some added playoff
momentum. They have won four
of their last five since a six-week
post-All-Star Game slump, and
their second-place finish was
their highest in 10 years.

The Penguins’ 87 points are

Yankees’ lohn proves critics wrong

By Jim Donaghy
AP Baseball Writer

A new era starts for the New
York Yankees Tuesday night with
a familiar face on the mound.

Dallas Green, making his
regular-season debut as the
Yankees manager, will send Tom-
myJohn, 45, against Minnesota's
Frank Viola at the Metrodome.

John, who was given little
chance to make the team, is in his
26th season.

”Tommy was the best pitcher
we had in spring training,” Green
said. ”He knew what the situa-
tion was and he proved he could
still pitch.”

The ”situation” was that Green
did not want John on the
Yankees’ staff. But club owner

George Stienbrenner offered John
$250,000 to come to spring train-
ing and another $250,000 if he
made the team.

In five exhibition games, John
pitched 24 innings and allowed
only four earned runs.

’’I knew I could still pitch,” said
John, who will be 46 on May 22.
”People here know what I can
do. I just had to prove it to
Dallas.”

In other season openers Tues-
day in the American League,
Chicago visits California and
Detroit is at Texas at night.

In openers in the National
League, Pittsburgh visits Mon-
treal, Philadelphia is at Chicago
and Houston entertains Atlanta at
night.

When John appeared in his first

season opener for the Chicago
White Sox in 1965, Viola was 5
years old.

Last season, Viola was 24-7
with a 2.64 earned—run average
and won the AL Cy Young
Award. '

”The first I remember of Tom-
my John was when he pitched for
the Dodgers,” Viola said. ”He
has gone through a lot of changes
as a pitcher.”

Viola’s 93 victories since 1984
are the most in the majors, fol-
lowed by Dwight Gooden’s 91.
Chicago at California

New White Sox manager Jeff
Torborg will have no shortage of
experience in his starting battery,
with left-hander Jerry Reuss, 39,
throwing to Carlton Fisk, 41.

My professional nursing career began at Shadyside _‘

Hospital and has continuedto grow here over the
past 13 years. I came to Shadyside as a R.N. with
one year of nursing experience. As’ a diploma nurs-
ing school graduate who was enrolled in P_itt’s R.N.-
to-B.S.N. program, I needed an institution which
would support me in my educational endeavors. The
tuition reimbursement was, of course, most helpful,
but the support I received from my co-workers on
3 Main made it possible.

After four years I moved into a nursing education
position which opened an entirely new realm of pos-
sibilities for me. The support of nursing management
and my co-workers in nursing education enabled me
to develop my potential as a teacher and a nursing
leader. I was able to enhance that formally through
the Master of Science in Nursing degree in nursing
education at Pitt. '

A nurturing environment and the encouragement
to excell are critical components to professional
growth. I found both at Shadyside.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April 4, 1989

And in our literary section, Pitt
baseball coach Bobby Lewis has
refused to remark on a spicy new
sports book about the University
of Pittsburgh baseball team.
Authored by Pittsburgh-native
Michael Chabon, the book is en-
titled The Dysenteries of Pitts-
burgh and is scheduled for a May
release date.

0 One of Paul Evans’ first
recruits at Pitt, a skinny 6-foot—9
forward from New Jersey named

Chris Gatling, was the second-
leading scorer in the Sun Belt
Conference this season with an
average of.22.4 ppg. Gatling, a
Prop 48 victim while at Pitt, trans-
ferred to Old Dominion at the
end of his freshman year in the
spring of 1987.

Gatling was also named

when he threw out the
ceremonial first pitch at Shea

White, the first black to be
selected as a league president
in baseball, succeeded A. Bart-

0 The question is (to anyone
who can answer it intelligently):
Where the in the hell did Seton
Hall come from?

0 The Los Angeles Raiders ex-
tensively used the NFL’s new free

agent system in an attempt to bol-
ster its present pussycat defense.
New names on the Raider roster
include nose tackle Bob Golic
(Cleveland), linebacker Jackie
Shipp (Miami), linebacker Otis
Wilson and cornerback Mike
Richardson (Chicago).

0 Former Pitt Panther defensive
back Gary Richard signed a free
agent contract with the Pittsburgh
Steelers this past weekend.
Richard saw limited action with
the Green Bay Packers as a rookie
in 1988.

0 Did the Pittsburgh Penguins
improve that much this season
over the 1987-1988 campaign?

Well, last year the Boys of

Winter had 36 wins, 35 losses
and 9 ties for a total of 81 points
and a sixth—p|ace Patrick division
finish.

This season, those same stats
were 40, 33 and 7 for 87’points
and a second-place finish.

Not that much.

0 The Esposito brothers of
hockey are undoubtedly one of
the most meddlesome duos in all
of professional‘ sports manage-
ment. In yet another questionable
move, Phil (GM of the New York

Rangers) on Saturday fired the"

Leyland probably will ex-
periment with his late-inning
relievers as he did early last-
season, giving Robinson some
save opportunities. Robinson
had eight saves by early June,
but only one after that.

”My one philosophy has
been that it isn't always the
best staff that wins; in some
cases it's the most healthy,”
Leyland said. ”So I try to pro-
tect guys. I'm not trying to
knock any other manager, but
some of these guys who save

 

a lot of games get some easy
ones. With Gott, most of his
saves were legitimate.”

Leyland is somewhat con-
cerned about Gott, but said
there's not much he can do if
Gott continues to be in-
effective.

”If he can't do it, we're in
trouble,” Leyland said. ”Just
like if Randy Myers doesn't do
it, the Mets are in trouble, or
if Todd Worrell doesn't do it,
the Cardinals are in trouble.”

Is Gott worried?

”I’m concerned only be-
cause of a lack of strength in
my arm right now,” he said.

”Last year was my first in a
role of a relief pitcher. I wasn't
sure how to handle the off-
season so I talked to relief
pitchers around the league,
guys who had been around.
[Kent Tekulve] said he never
touched a ball during the off-
season.”

Gott decided not to throw
during the winter months, be-
cause, ”We had a bad winter
[in Utah], and there was a lit-
tle soreness in my elbow, so I
thought the rest would do me
good/’

 Iikejay Bell. He's a dirt-
ball; he wants to play. He's a
hungry player. He has good
instincts. When he swings the
bat, he's got a chance to make
things happen,” Leyland said.

”With Jay, you see aggres-
siveness, you see that he's able
to sting the ball and you see
that he has a lot of confi-
dence,” hitting coach Milt
May said. ”I’d like to calm him
down a little bit and still main-
tain that aggressiveness.”

The Pirates hope to get the
same kind of early-season
production from third base-
man Bobby Bonilla they got in
1988, when he was the Na-
tional League’s player of the
month in April and May.
Bonilla hit .407 with an NL-
high 25 RBI in exhibition play.

(AP) — Rennie Stennett, try-
ing to become the first major
leaguer to return to active duty
five years after retiring, has
been released by the Pitts-
burgh Pirates.

Stennett, who will be 38
Wednesday, batted .600 in the
Pirates intrasquad games and
was 2-for-3 as a pinch—hitter in
exhibition games. ’

”Rennie is one of those peo-
ple who will think he can hit
forever,” said Chuck LaMar,
the Pirates’ director of minor

league operations. ”We felt
[that] his speed, his arm and
his defensive skills had
diminished.”

Stennett accepted his
release without complaint,
although he said he was disap-
pointed, LaMar said.

Stennett, an infielder, played
in 1,079 games for the Pirates
from 1971-79 and the San
Francisco Giants in 1980 and
1981. He had a .274 career
average and was hitting .336
when he fractured an ankle on

Rennie Stennett, Tito Landrum
and two others cut by Pirates

Aug. 21, 1977. He never
returned to form after the

injury.

Stennett played two minor-

The Pirates also released

fielders Tito Landrum and

A free throwtby Daryll Walker

- V gave the Pirates a two-point ad-

vantage and Rice once again got
the lead back for Michigan with
a 3-pointer with 1:03 to play.

After Morton threw up an air-
ball with 53 seconds left, Michi-
gan ran the clock down to 34
seconds before Sean Higgins
made two free throws for the
three-point lead that was erased
by Morton's 3-pointer.

Michigan had a chance for vic-
tory in regulation, but Rice
missed a long jumper with two
seconds to play.

Higgins added 10 points and
nine rebounds for Michigan,
30-7. Rice added 11 rebounds.

Walker and Greene each
finished with 13 points for Seton
Hall, 31-7, which was making its
first Final Four appearance in just
its second NCAA tournament.

head ‘coach. Bergeron’s record
with the Rangers was 37-33-8.

And just a year ago, Tony Es-
posito of the Penguins canned
Pierre Creamer even though he
was leading the team to the
second-highest number of wins in
franchise history.

0 The Pitt basketball team has
beaten an NCAA tournament
finalist in three of the past five
seasons.

In the 1984-1985 season, Pitt
toppled eventual champion Vil-
lanova, 85-62, which defeated
Georgetown for the NCAA title.

In 1987, it tripped Syracuse
twice, 84-70 and 63-61. Syracuse
eventually lost the NCAA final to
Indiana.

And this season, the Panthers
defeated Seton Hall twice, 82-79
and 82-76.

Pa. court
upholds
Ali tax
ruling

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) —
Commonwealth Court on
Monday upheld a ruling that
helped former heavyweight
champion boxer Muhammad
Ali save his house in Lower
Merion, Montgomery County,
from being sold at a tax sale.

The appeals court said the
tax sale notice sent to Ali was
flawed because it was not es-
tablished that the person who
signed for the notice was -
authorized by Ali to do so. The
decision affirmed a 1987 rul-
ing by Montgomery County
Common Pleas Court.

’’I’m extremely happy,” said
Ali's attorney, Oscar Gaskins
of Philadelphia.

He said the house was sold
at a tax sale on Sept. 9, 1985,
for $20,000. Gaskins said All
had purchased —the house
some time before for $70,000,

- and it was probably worth
$120,000. The tax bill was for
between $4,000 and $6,000, -
Gaskins said.

Gaskins said the taxeshave

= since been paid, and Ali, who
lives in California, has given
the house to his teenage
daughter, Khalia. ,
A corporation, 850 Modena
Street lnc., had bought the
house at the tax sale and had
appealed the Montgomery
County Court ruling to Com-
monwealth Court. ‘ Attorney
- Alfred O. Breinig Jr., listed in
court documents as the attor-
ney representing the corpora-
tion, was not in his, office
Monday.

PREDICTION ,— Rangers’
are in turmoil due to coaching‘
changes and will enter the
playoffs on a five-game losing
streak. They have more playoff
experience, but the Penguins
have Lemieux, Coffey and
Brown, which should be
I enough to move them into the.
