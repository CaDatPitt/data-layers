Will heart trnsplants be obsolete?

UPMC cardiologists have high hopes for controversial procedure
Lisa Infield

 

 

UPMC cardiologists have per-
formed an operation that may delay
or even eliminate the need for heart
transplants,
but they have
virtually no-
knowledge of
its long-term
effects.

The operation, left ventricular
reduction surgery, has only been per-
formed at one other U.S. hospital,
and the procedure’s creator, Randas
J. Vilela
Batista, began
operating only
two years ago
in the jungles
of Brazil.

Rosenblum said that this type of
surgery could not have been per-
formed here if not for the success of
the operation on Batista’s Brazilian

 

patients.

“[Batista] performed no experi-
ments on animals beforehand,”
Rosenblum said. “[The surgery] is the
type of thing that would never have
been performed in this country with-
out expert data. But now that he has
done it, it is possible to do here.”

First results from the procedure,
which removes one-fifth to one-
fourth of the muscle in the left ventri-
cle area of the heart [see diagram],
indicate “an increase in cardiac out-
put from 3.5 to 6 liters per minute,”
according to Robert Kormos, one of
the doctors who performed the
surgery last month in Cleveland.

The operation is only performed
when enough damage is caused to the
heart muscle that it doesn’t circulate
a sufficient volume of oxygenated
blood.

“It’s for patients that don’t have
significant blockages in their arteries
as a cause of the weakened muscle,
patients who have heart failure for
unknown reasons. They are probably
the best candidates,” Rosenblum said.

There have been no recent reports
on the Cleveland patient’s condition,

Libertarian VP candidate

The vice—presidential candidate of the
Libertarian party tried to teach Pitt students
a little self-defense last Friday.

“I treat politics now as self-defense. 

feel I have to ﬁght to protect my life, my lib-
erty, and my property from Bob Dole and
Bill Clinton” said Jo Jorgenson, the
Libertarian party’s vice-presidential nomi-
nee.

J orgenson addressed approximately 30
people Friday in Forbes Quad about the val-
ues of the Libertarian party. When she saw
the crowd, she asked, “Is this an all-male
campus? Where are all the women?”

It was not the usual candidate stump
speech. Instead, she spent most of the time
discussing political issues with her audi-
ence.

“I’m only doing this because this is a

college campus and this is more philosoph-

 

ical,” Jorgenson said

In his introduction to Jorgenson, Dan
Sullivan, the vice chair of the Pittsburgh
Libertarian Party, stated that although the
Libertarian Party is comprised of left- and
right—wing members, it “has a right—wing
ﬂavor. It leaves a right—wing taste in your
mouth  because the Libertarian Party orig-
inally was made up of Republicans who
broke away from the party over disgust
with Nixon.”

According to Jorgenson, the
Libertarian Party is the “small—govemment
party.” She claims it is the only party ﬁght-
ing for a decrease in the size of government.

Although the Republican Party gener-
ally campaigns for “less government,”
Ronald Reagan signed thousands of bills
into law as well as recommending higher
spending every year he was in oﬂice,
according to J orgenson.

date, Bob Dole, raised taxes tvvioe the

’’Is Cuba so dangerous?” asks
Orlaida Cabrera Gutierrez.

Cuban official:

U.S. interests

Cesca Antonelli

 

America would beneﬁt from ending
the embargo against Cuba, especially in
health care, according to an oﬂicial from
that country and members of the
Pittsburgh Cuba Coalition.

Orlaida Cabrera Gutierrez, who
works at the Cuban Institute for
Friendship with the People as head of
their U.S. Affairs desk, told a group of 40
people at Frick Fine Arts Thursday that
the U.S. embargo, though devastating to
the Cubans, has also been hurting this
country.

“Cuba has confronted the issues of
health care, racism, crime, and sexism,”
said Ginny Hildebrand, a member of the
Pittsburgh Cuba Coalition. “And we all
need to learn from other countries -—- in
some cases, more successful countries
like Cuba”

According to Gutierrez, Americans
are not being given the opportunity to
beneﬁt from Cuba’s medical discoveries,
like the world’s only meningococcus type
B vaccine. More than 3,000 American
children are infected with this disease,
which can cause meningitis, each year.
This vaccine is now being used in South
America and Europe but is prohibited by

Dorm studen is react to
Legionnaires in water

  
  

Rachel

The superheated ﬂushing of the water

' lines in Litchﬁeld Towers is over, but stu-

dents’ nerves are still on edge over the
legionella bacteria found in the pipes this
summer. A

Once a statement was made public
about the bacteria in the dormitory water,
many students fell prey to the power of sug-
gestion and couldn’t tell whether ﬂu-like
symptoms were a result of the yearly com-
mon cold and ﬂu, or Legiomraires’ disease,
the pneumonia-like illness caused by the
legionella bacteria

Though Pitt released a statement saying
the bacteria was only harmful to the very old
or weak, students were still fearful.

“Everyone [on my ﬂoor] was panicldng
in general,” said Michelle Melonja, a resi-
dent assistant in Tower B. She said that many
of her residents on the 17th ﬂoor had cold-
like symptoms and didn’t know whether or
not they had contracted the disease.

Melonja complained that resident assis-
tants were not given enough notice or infor-
mation about the bacteria, and that the media
was the ﬁrst to know of the disease.
Residents asking questions and expressing
concern to their RA were simply given an “I
don’t know” answer.

Some students felt that the infonnation

that was eventually given to them about the
disease came too late. Micah Weglinski, a
TowerAresident, said the University was not
truthful.

“I want to know why something wasn’t
done in the summer after the Towers work-
ers got sick with Legionnaires’,” Weglinski
said.

Even when information was given out,
students still felt nervous about trusting it.
“No one drank the water even though they
[the University] said it was O ” said
Resident Assistant Neil English.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said the
treatment to rid the Towers of the disease was
completed as scheduled last Friday. One
tower was done each day.

Bathrooms were closed from 9 am to 3 .

pm. during the day and the water systems
were ﬂushed with scalding-hot water.
Service said the process was done during the
day while many students were in classes to
prevent the hot water from injuring anyone.

“The expectation is that there will be no
further need for action,” Service said The
results of testing to see whether the proce-
dure was successful in ridding the pipes of
thebacteriawillbeknownintwotothnee
weeks.

Service said small pockets of the disease
could still arise in the pipes, but in those cases
it will be possible to “spot treat,” as opposed
to shutting down all the pipes again.

Students volunteer in Oakland

Marc Nuzzo

   

Despite the rain and dismal skies,
Pitt students turned out to participate in
the second-armual “Pittsburgh Project”
Saturday to give something back to
their community.

More than 600 students were
directed to one of six locations to help
with speciﬁc jobs, while others went to
the streets of Oakland to pick up trash.

The Center Avenue YMCA,
Shadyside Boys’ and Girls’ Club,
Thomas Merton Center, VA Hospital,
the Pittsburgh Vocational Rehabilitation
Center, and the One More Time Thrift
Shop all beneﬁtted from the services
provided by Greek organizations, the
Pitt Band, the SGB, Pitt service groups,
and various individuals.

The groups which travelled to the
six locations did a variety of jobs.
Volunteers who went to the VA Hospital
met with patients, served ice cream, and
helped with tasks such as stuffing
envelopes. The Pittsburgh AIDS
Task Force was helped in making over
6000 safe-sex Halloween packages for
students, which included various pieces

-.-|.!._r‘s

of safe sex literature and contraceptive
devices.

The group which travelled to the
Center Avenue YMCA helped to clean
the kitchen and the homeless shelter
provided there.

Some groups walked through
Saturday’s drizzle to clean up the
streets of Oakland. According to Jane
Berger, co-director and student out-
reach representative, Pitt students
“were able to cover all of Oakland from
Schenley Heights. down into South
Oakland.” -

The $11,000 budget for the project
only required $2000 from the Pitt stu-
dent activity fee fund due to the support
from more than 20 Pittsburgh business-
es. Donations in the form of food, trash
bags, gloves, and even walkie-talkies
“made the program possible and cut
down on our expenditures,” said
Berger.

Organizers for the event were
happy with the overall turnout and
accomplishments.

“Fortunately, it all came together
this year,” said Justin Dalmolin, co-
director of the project. “The organiza-
tion of the project has been incredible.”

(Editors note: this is a personal account of
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer Russ Krebs’ experience at
last Fridays campaign speech by President
Clinton at Robert Morris College.)

I almost got killed — but I met the pres-
ident.

When I was being led upstairs to meet
President Clinton after his speech last Friday,
I was nervous as hell. To get to the room
where I would meet Clinton after his speech
and take his picture, I had to go outside and
come back in through the press gate again.
This meant I would have to be searched
again. .

On this day, I had become used to being
searched. Security around the president is
very tight, especially when you are behind
the scenes where he walks around freely.
However, this search was totally different

By this time, the walk—tl1rough metal
detectors had already been dismantled. This
meant the federal marshall had to use a
wand on me — not unlike the ones they use
on you in the airport when the plate in your
head sets olf the metal detector.

She passed the wand over my back and
my legs with no problems. Then a Secret
Service Agent, attempting to be a real stud in
front of this cute marshal], decided to try his
favorite comedy act on me.

When the Marshall went around to my
ﬁont, this “stu ” came up behind me, pulled

THE ‘PITT NEWS

out his gun and shouted, “How did you miss
this gun?Thismanhadagtminhispants!”
I don’t know about you, but to me this
“joke” was about as funny as standing up on
a plane and screaming, “Nobody move, I

have a bomb!” and then saying, “Just kid—'

ding.”

After he said this, Secret Service agents
in the area converged on me. As they came
running, the “stud” shouted out, “It’s just a
joke, I know her,” he said, referring to the
marshall.

Very funny joke, I thought, as I checked
my pants for wet spots and chocolate pud-

 

dangerous.

The day started out pretty routinely.
Clinton was supposed to arrive at 11 a.m., so
as part of the press, I had to be there before
10 a.m.

When I arrived at 9:30 a.m., I had to
walk through a metal detector and have my
bag searched. Since I wasn’t playing the role
of a terrorist, they found nothing and I
walked into the auditorium.

Once inside, I went back to the press
area, which was about 100 feet from the
stage. After standing there for a few minutes,
I saw my contact and he took me to the VIP

ding. Thank section. This place
God, I hadn’t was a lot closer to
eaten or drunk Clinton than the
anything yet that press area, so
day, so no mess. when nobody said

Apparently, anything to me, I
the other agents sat down and
didn’t ﬁnd it too stayed there dur-
funny either. One ing the entire

asked Joe Stud whose gun it was and when
he replied that it was his, the other agent
stemly said, “Why?” as he pulled him aside.

Hopefullyafterapranklikethat, atthe
possible cost of another man’s life (or at least
his dry cleaning bill), this stud’s most excit-
ing assignment will be cleaning Socks’ litter
box. The agent’s prank caused a complete
breach of security for the president — my
search was never completed, not even my
bag was searched.

Fortunately, the rest of my day —
though almost as exciting —- was a lot less

speech.

Public speaking is one of President
Clinton’s strengths, so it was no surprise that
he gave a crowd-rousing speech that left sev-
eral supporters with no voice.

While people were screaming and
cheering, I made my way over to the fence
where he would leave the auditorium to try
to get some pictures and possibly a quote
from the president. Even though I was
warned not to ask any questions, I just could-
n’t be this close to the president and not ask

him anything.

I Writer risks life and limb to meet President Clinton

As Clinton made his way to where I was
standing, I took several closeup pictures of
him. Finally, he was right in ﬁont of me.
After shaking his hand, I identiﬁed myself
and asked him why he thought he deserved
the vote of college students.

Clinton’s handlers shouted repeatedly,
“No quotes!” However, Clinton did grace
me with an answer — even if it wasn’t exact-
ly what I had wanted to hear. He said to me:
“I just gave a speech on that.”

I had listened to his spwch, so I knew
what the speech was about. I had just hoped
that Clinton would give me a printable
quote. Oh well, no harm in trying.

After the president had passed me, I saw
his local press secretary out of the comer of
my eye. She had promised to help me get a
picture of Clinton with the president of Pitt’s
University Democrats, Paul McKrell, and
she delivered ' A

She called Paul and I over to the back of
the stage and took us behind the scenes. It
seemed like every Secret Service agent that
we passed asked who we were, why we
were there, and then searched us.

After walking around behind the scenes
for a little while and after the incident with
Joe Stud, we were ﬁnally upstairs awaiting
President Clinton. ~

Finally, he came up the stairs. It was a
strange scene. Since most of the people
upstairs worked for him, nobody really
seemedtocarethathewasupstairs—

except Paul and I. It wasn’t
what I expected at all. There
were hardly any people
upstairs except for Clinton, the
Secret Service and some of his
aides. Oh, and of course Paul
and I.

Regardless of your politi-
cal beliefs, being that close to
the president of the free world
is one hell of a rush. I took a
few more pictures before being
told to go into a small room and
wait for the president.

There were about 20 peo-
ple in this room, mostly volun-
teers for the campaign and rep-
resentatives from the police
forces that were present that
day. Everybody was lined up
around the walls of the room. I
was the only one that stuck out.
But, the press secretary had told
everyone that I was a volunteer
myself (even though I don’t
volunteer for any political can-
didates), so nobody questioned
my being there.

After waiting a few min-
utes, President Clinton made
his way into the room. There
was an instant feeling of elec-
tricity in the air. Something
amazing was about to happen

first time that day.

Making his way around
the room, Clinton shook the
hand of everyone in the room
and had a few words for each
person. When he ﬁnally made
his way to Paul, I took the pic-
ture of him shaking Paul’s
hand. Unfortunately, Mu1phy’s
Law prevailed and the lighting
was tenible in the picture when
it was developed.

When President Clinton
was done with Paul, it was my
turn. Since I was wonied about
trying to take a good picture of
him, I hadn’t even thought of
what I might say.

Clinton came up to me and
thanked me for being there. I

cent a year.

Jorgenson said the Libertarian party is
based on the principle of upholding the rights
to life, liberty, and property guaranteed in the
Constitution. According to J orgenson,
Libertarians believe the best way to protect
these rights is through the smallest amount of
governmental intrusion into the life of
Americans.

They propose to do this by eliminating
the federal income tax and selling off all gov-
emmental commodities, such as national
parks, the U.S. Postal Service, and Social
Security in order to pay oif the national debt

The interference of the federal govem-
ment is the reason school tuition is so high,
according to J orgenson. The alternative is the
end of federal student aid, and Jorgenson

thinks that school and state need to be com-
pletely separated.

Vlfrth the elimination of the federal
income tax, the Libertarian party ﬁgures that
each family will have up to $8,000 more in
their pockets to use for the education of their
children in whatever manner they see ﬁt.

Jorgenson said that tuition did not start
to increase until the federal government
started to give student aid and the cost of
educationhad stayed level until the govern-
ment started to subsidize it. Then costs went
up. She said the only way to bring costs
down again is to eliminate federal student
aid

The only function of the federal govern-
ment in a Libertarian America would be to
provide the  courts, and protection.

The only purpose of the military would be to
protect America from threats within its own
borders.

The Libertarian Party’s candidates are

campaign qualiﬁed for federal matching
ﬁmds, they refused to accept them on the
grounds that: they would take no government

“We could have used the fimds for

made it easier to get into the debates. But we
don’t want to take any government money.
Ross Perot talks about reducing the debt, but
he just added $29 million to it.”

J orgenson also discussed Penot’s ﬁght to

Perot should be included in the debates, and
that the Libertarians have been ﬁghting for

“They used the criteria of whether we
stood a chance of getting elected in the fall to
keep us out of the debates. And I ask, then
what is Bob Dole doing up there?”

Tear down the trade
walls with Cuba

It is in America_’s best interest to end the embargo
on Cuba. Not only would we gain access to the only
meningococcus type B vaccine in the world, we would
also allow ourselves access into Cuba to change the
policies they have with which we disagree.

The embargo was started in 1961 for the very sim-
ple reason that Americans don’t like communism. It’s
as pure and straightforward as that. Obviously, as Cuba
is still a communist state and Fidel Castro is still in
power over 30 years later. The embargo is not a suc-
cess. ‘

The way for us to make a difference in Cuba is to
lead by example. It is time for us to try a little more of
the carrot, and a lot less of the stick. If we want Cuba
to become a more democratic society, the way to do
that is to show them the benefitsof playing ball with
the only surviving superpower, the United States.

By allowing American goods and services to be
traded with Cuba, our government will be showing
Cubans how our system works, and if our system truly
is the best, they won’t be able to resist shaking off the
chains of communism.

Cuba needs to be led into the free world market
with leadership and integrity. We cannot get them to
join us with the finger—pointing scolding of an embar-
go.

Besides the fact that we can bring Cuba into the
fold, we would greatly benefit from having access to
the meningoccus type B vaccine. This vaccine wards
off meningitis, which infects more than 3,000 children
a year in the U.S. Due to the embargo, U.S. law pro-
hibits its usage. '

This embargo has been ineffective since the early
‘60s, and the measures taken in February 1996 to
strengthen it have not made it any better. It is time for
our government to do away with this outdated and
pointless embargo.

They really do put mayo on tries

 

One of the many fun aspects
of living in another country is
trying new and exciting foods.
Since I’m sure you’re all dying

to know more about the
Netherlands, I’ll indulge your
curiosity by telling you a bit
about two speciﬁc Dutch foods.
First I’ll explain a food curiosity
that was made common knowl-
edge through Pulp Fiction.
Then, I’ll reveal a little-known
Dutch dish that’s sure to make
your mouth water.

I’ll gladly admit that what
John Travolta said is true: the
Dutch do eat their ﬁies with
mayonnaise. But it doesn’t stop
there. Before I expand upon that,
I must describe the places where
people get their fries. Fries are
the primary offering at snack
bars, which are the only places
you can get something to eat late
at night. There are two types of
snack bars. The one kind serves
the fries in a small, rectangular,
plastic dish with a separate com-
partment for the sauce. The other
type of snack bar serves the fries
in a very traditional point bag —
that’s a paper bag in the shape of
an upside-down cone. The sauce
is then plopped on top of the
fries in a big glob.

Both snack bars offer a wide
variety of sauces. Fries, inciden-

- tally, are cut fatter than they are

here and tend to be a bit crispier
around the edges. Anyway, back

.to. the _ sauces. ..The- infamous . — .

mayonnaise comes in two sorts:
either frite sauce or real mayon-
naise. Frite sauce is a yellower,
saltier, and cheaper variation on
American mayo. Real mayon-
naise is the same as the mayo
here. Then there’s also ketchup,
mustard, peanut sauce (from the
Indonesian inﬂuence), Tstatsiki
(from the Greek inﬂuence), gar-
lic sauce, war (which means
ketchup, mayonnaise and onions
together), Ranch dressing, rel-
ish, and curry sauce. In addition
to all these choices, you can also
get any combination of any of
the above. The standard is deﬁ-
nitely patat met which means
“fries with.” That automatically
means fries with frite sauce.
Whatever you choose, ‘believe
me, those steaming fries taste
great at 4 a.m. on the way home
from some crazy party at a hot
club.

Moving from that very salty
treat to a sweeter dish, I’ll now
reveal how the Dutch pancake is
unique. First of all, pancakes are
dinner when going out to a
restaurant for them. This may
sound odd, but considering their
size and variety, it’s actually
quite logical.

When going out to eat pan-
cakes, you go to special pancake
houses. The best on in Holland is
located in Hoog Soeren (that’s a
tip in case you ever go to the
Netherlands). Dutch—sty1e pan-
cakes are much different from
American ones. Whereas the
American pancake is small, fat,

and-ﬂuffy; the Dutch .one-is,the .-

size of a large plate and is much
more like a French pancake in its
consistency. You deﬁnitely can-
not eat more than one, and a lot
of people can’t even ﬁnish that
one. The selection at the pancake
houses is amazing. You can get
sweet or savory, even spicy
ones. The amount of choices can
run well over one hundred.
These range anywhere from the
classic raison and apple to ham
and cheese to ginger and pineap-
ple, all baked right into the bat-
ter. One of the "favorites was
called Pommetje ‘Prik and was
with banana, vanilla ice cream,
and Grand Marnier. Another
popular choice was cherries,
cream and cherry liquor. All pan-
cakes, whether sweet or savory,
are served with powdered sugar
and syrup as optional condi-
ments. In any case, I’ve never
heard of anyone being disap-
pointed with his choice. The
variety guarantees that everyone
can find some combination
appealing.

So as you can see, Holland
also offers some very special
and extremely tasty cuisine. As
far as price goes, both dishes are
within student reach. Fries go for
around $2, and a good pancake
is around $8. I deﬁnitely recom-
mend either of these magniﬁcent
treats to anyone who has a
chance to go to the Netherlands.
And next time you have some
fries, try them with mayonnaise!

Machteld de iWaard really miss-

..es -the extra raisin pancakes. .

The Gulf War was an ego boost, but not very effective

 

a few short weeks ago, Iraqi dictator Saddam
Hussein (probably responding to an incur-
sion by Iranian troops into Northern Iraq a
few weeks earlier and not attempting to chal-
lenge President Clinton, as some have
thought) accepted the invitation of a Kurdish
faction waning With rival Irar1ian—backed
Kurds to enter the city of Erbil. President
Clinton wisely launched a series of cruise
missile attacks against air defense installa-
tions in Iraq and extended the no—ﬂy zone
further north to punish the dictator. Now that
it appears that the situation in Iraq is sim-
mering down, people are beginning to ask
the question: why is Saddam in power? Also,
what can we possibly do about him?

For the past ﬁve years the United States
has been unable to do anything but watch as
Hussein put down coup after coup, execut-
ing anyone of whom he had suspicions of
disloyalty. He even executed his own sons-
in—law for defecting and then returning.
Unfortunately, we will probably be seeing
the Iraqi dictator for a long, long time to
come.

Former‘ chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Stall‘, General Colin Powell wrote in his
autobiography “My American Journey:” “I
expect, years from now, historians will ask if
we should not have fought longer and
destroyed the Iraqi army  It is naive, how-
ever, to think that if Saddam had fallen, he

would have been replaced by a J eifersonian
in some sort of desert democracy where peo-
ple read ‘The Federalist Papers’ along with
the Koran.” General Powell‘ added:
“Possibly we would have ended up with a
Saddam by another name.” General Powell
went on to note that military historians have
spent years debating the results of hundreds
of military conﬂicts.

While I understand General Powell’s
defensiveness, I believe it is the duty of
everyone in a

 

itary triumph, but the Bush administration’s
decision to end the war in 1991 has had dis-
astrous consequences for the United States
and the Arab world in 1996.

What went wrong? When President
Bush moved to eject the Iraqi army from
Kuwait (for which he deserves enormous
credit), he and his advisers gave little thought
to what would be done after the military

campaign.

 

Why did we not continue into Iraq?
President Bush and General Powell defend-
ed their decision to stop the war by noting
that the UN and Congress only granted per-
mission for military conﬂict for the purpose
of liberating Kuwait, and once the objective
was accomplished there was nothing left to
ﬁght on about.

However, would President Roosevelt
have ordered General Eisenhower to halt
American forces at the German border after
having ejected

The Persian Gulf War wasanenormous mil- removed from power or prevented from

wreaking havoc again.

After President Clinton’s cruise missile
attack, critics launched into a baﬁling series
of attacks on the President Why, they asked,
did the President allow the multinational
coalition that beat Saddam in 1996 fall to
disarray? The answer is simple: 1996 is a

much, much different year than 1991. The ,

Persian Gulf region is a lot more volatile
today than it was ﬁve years ago. The pro-

western governments of Turkey and Saudi
Arabia have become increasingly unstable.
The Saudis found it embarrassing to
acknowledge the presence of U.S. armed
forces in their country following the terrorist
bombing earlier this year. Coupled with the
rise of Iran and the weariness of other Arab
governments with the continuing presence
of American forces in the Gulf, ﬁghting the
mad dictator is more diﬁicult today than it
was in 1991.

So what can the United States do? A
massive land war to eject Saddam ﬁom
power is out of the quesﬁon because no
country in the region would agree to allow
the build-up within their borders. The CIA’ s
inept assassination efforts and attempts to
build up the Kurds have been miserable fail-
ures. Considering that President Clinton is
unwilling to attempt an air campaign against
the Iraqis for fear of losing the lives of
American pilots, his decision to use cruise
missiles was the right decision. These
weapons are very accurate and do not risk
the lives of American pilots. Unfortunately,
beyond preventing Saddam’s air force from
ﬂying and keeping his air defense network
pinned down, there is little the United States
can possibly do to remove the Iraqi dictator.
We can only hope that one of his own gen-
erals .will do our dirty work for us and ﬁnish
the job that should have been ﬁnished in
1991.

than any other person in politics today.

SPORTS

A bit of ‘dis ’n

    

Thought I ’d let you know:
- Pitt has been outscored 117-O the last two
weeks. And so far this season, Pitt has yet to
score a point during a television broadcast. If
that formula holds true, Pitt should defeat
Temple and Virginia Tech, but lose the
remainder of the schedule, ﬁnishing the sea-
son at 3-8, one game better than last year.

0 For the last decade or so, Pirates third base-
man Dale Sveum harkens to the nickname:
“The worst player in baseball.”

0 After Byron “Bam” Morris signed a two-
year contract worth $1.8 million with the
Baltimore Ravens this week, an anonymous
group of potlieads deduced that Bam would
now be capable of purchasing 1,636 pounds
of marijuana (paraphemalia is extra).

- For all those who now think Tony’

Zimrnennan’s career is forever jinxed after
being sacked and then fumbling on his ﬁrst
two college snaps Saturday: fear not. Pitt’s
greatest quarterback, Dan Maiino, threw an
interception for his ﬁrst collegiate pass.

- After the Pittsburgh Steelers dismantle the
Kansas City Chiefs next Monday night,
people will forget about one bad game
against Jacksonville and remember that hav-
ing the best defense in the NFL can always
win a championship.

- Oh, by the way, isn’t it nice obtaining the
AFC’s most intimidating runner (in Jerome
Bettis) for next year’s fourth—round pick.
Although the Steelers surrendered this
year’s second—round pick, they selected
Carlos Emmons, the guy they wanted to
take second, in the third round.

- Finally, I propose a solution to Pirates
owner Kevin McClatchy, who’s mired in
financial difficulties: get together with
Barn’s new stash and go ﬁfty—fifty on it.
Bam can supply the goods, and McClatchy
can move it. An anonymous group of pot-
heads deduced that at street value, 1,636
pounds of weed can amount to $5 .325 mil-
lion, covering the amount lost when general
partner Frank Fuhrer pulled out of his Pirate
investment.

Hurricanes pummel Pil-I, 45-0

 

Pitt’s Saturday game at Miami fea-

of freshman running back LeFann
Williams, and the transformation of
wide receiver Curtis Anderson into

defensive back Curtis Anderson.

Even with all the new blood and a
few new trick plays, one thing didn’t
change — the result. Pitt was blanked
for the second straight week, losing
45-0 to the Hurricanes and falling to 1-
4 overall.

“It never feels good when you
lose,” said Head Coach Johnny



Majors, “but, as ridiculous as this may
sound, I think we came out and played
pretty hard early on. We kept the game
close early, [but] we missed some early
opportunities.”

The team’s first opportunity on
offense ended quickly, when three Pitt
rushes netted nine yards and a fourth-
down punt. The Hurricanes would cap-
italize with a l0—play, 70-yard drive,
scoring on an eight-yard run by
Danyell Ferguson.

The drive was the first by
Anderson at comerback since his last
season at E.C. Glass High School. His
defensive rust showed on an early
third—down play, when Hurricane Tony
Gaiter got a step on the Pitt sprinter

. and kept the drive alive with a seven-

yard catch.

More rust showed up later, when
Gaiter beat Anderson for a 24-yard
touchdown. It was his second of three
on the afternoon, tying a Hurricane
record. Anderson wasn’t on the hook
for all of them and made his feelings
toward Gaiter known after the contest.

“I know Tony Gaiter,” said
Anderson, who has seen his fellow Big
East sprinter at track competitions. “I
wasn’t really impressed. They just got
the ball to him, that’s all. I see speed
every day, on the track and every-
thing.”

Speed or no speed, two second-
quarter scores by Gaiter gave the
Hurricanes a 21-0 halftime lead. The
Pitt offense stayed silent all half, with
Gonzalez completing under half of his
passes and the rotating backﬁeld of

The second year of the new
baseball playoff format should fea-

the road to the 1996 World Series.
Let’s take a look at each team and
their chances of winning it all.

1. ATLANTA BRAVES: This is
Atlanta’s fifth—straight postseason
appearance and the Braves’ pitch-
ing staff gives them the best overall
chance of taking it all. The only
thing that could hurt is having
young position players like
Jermaine Dye, Andrue, and Chipper

will help tremendously, as will the
acquisition of lefty Denny Neagle.
ODDS TO WIN WORLD SERIES
— 2:1.

2. NEW YORK YANKEES: The
Yankees can put up some big num-
bers with potent bats upand down
the lineup. Pitching, however, is
what wins championships, and N.Y.
will need veteran starters Jimmy
Key and David Cone to step up
along with closer John Wetteland.
The Yankees have waited too long
for a World Series to come to town,
and this could be their year. ODDS
—— 3:1.

3. LOS ANGELES DODGERS:
The Dodgers’ starting pitching and
ace Hideo Nomo have to shine if
they want to topple the mighty
Braves for the National League
Championship. Mike Piazza, Eric
Karros, and Raul Mondesi form a

intimidating one—two—three punch,
but the pitching is the Dodgers’ key
to playoff success. ODDS — 3:1.
4. CLEVELAND INDIANS: Some
holes in the Indians’ pitching staff
could be detrimental to their play-
off chances,_yet Albert Belle could
get hot and carry them to a title.
Their top three starters of Charles
Nagy, Orel Hershiser, and Jack
McDowell must provide good per-
formances and keep them in the
game. ODDS — 5:1.

5. BALTIMORE ORIOLES:
Brady Anderson’s power surge this
year surprised everyone. He, Rafael
Palmeiro, and Bobby Bonilla will
attempt to power the American
League wild—cards to the World
Series. Everybody’s waiting to see
Cal Ripken’s return to the World

Now you can add Wayne Gretzky to
the list.

In a division fully loaded with talent

. and blue-collar teams, the National

Hockey League’s Atlantic Division
looks again to be the most competitive
one in the 1996-97 season.

Last season, the competitive gap
between ﬁrst and sixth was smaller than

paign with 26 wins, a .904 save percent-
age and 2.68 goals—against-average.
While “The Beezef’ won’t be around for-
ever, he is still Florida’s most valuable

1. Philadelphia Flyers (last season: 45-
24-13, 1st)

Eric Lindros and company look to
rebound off a disappointing 1996 playoff
performance.

The Flyers have no worries on
offense. The loss of forward Shawn
Antoski is a blessing in disguise, making
room for enforcers Dan Kordic and
newly-acquired Scott Daniels. The 6-foot-
5, 220-pound Kordic will i get premium
time on the third and fourth lines this sea-
son. Daniels fmished last year in Hartford
with 254 penalty minutes.

Philly’s defense needs to step it up for
the ‘96-’97 campaign. Head Coach Terry
Murray’s team ﬁnished third in the league
defensively last season, but nobody could
tell when Florida ousted them in the con-
ference semiﬁnals. The Flyers added
some size and strength with rookie J anne
Niiminaa. Most scouts think he can make
an immediate impact.

The season, however, hinges on the
success of goaltender Ron Hextall. The
10-year veteran enjoyed the best season of
his career last year, leading the NHL with
a 2.17 goals—against-average. If Hextall
falls, the team does with him.

2. Florida Panthers (41-31-10, 3rd)

Head Coach Doug MacLean and the
Florida Panthers shocked the hockey
world last season, knocking out Philly and
Pittsburgh en ‘route to the 1996 Stanley
Cup Finals. Don’t be surprised if it hap-
pens again.‘ _

While the Panthers rely heavily on
teamwork instead of individual talent, this
squad is stacked with promising young
prospects. Rob Niedermayer, 22, ﬁnished
last season with 26 goals and 61 points.
As the future leader of this slowly aging
oﬁense, Niedermayer is due for a break-
out year.

If Niedermayer is the future of
Florida’s offense, Ed Jovanovski is the
backbone of the Panther defense. While
the young 6-foot-2 blueliner has only
been around one season, Jovanovski plays

for one more memorable campaign.

At 35, you’d think Messier had sold
his soul to the devil after putting up last
year’s numbers. The Rangers long-time
leader ﬁnished seventh in goals last sea-
son (47) and 13th in points (99).

If you watched last month’s World
Cup, you know 28-year"-old defenseman
Brian Leetch proved he’s just getting
started. If this team gels quickly, the Texas
native should put up some career num-
bers. Look for 1996 number-one draft
pick Jeff Brown to get some early playing
time with the Rangers. Brown, 18, stands
6-foot-2 and weighs 222 pounds.

After struggling through the second
half of last season, goalie Mike Richter
turned in an MVP performance at the
World Cup. If the 30-year-old Pa. native
can stay off the injured list, the Rangers
could play their way into June.

4. Washington Capitals (39-32-ll, 4th)

Head Coach Jim Schoenfeld and
General Manager David Poile have ﬁnal-
1y created the perfect balance of promis-
ing youth and crafty veterans for the
Capitals. The only problem is, they still
won’t score enough.

While winger Peter Bondra drarnati—

- cally improved last season with 52 goals

in 67 games, he also accounts for about 25
percent of the Capitals’ scoring.

‘ VV1th Joe Juneau out because of a
wrist injury for at least four weeks, who
else can give this team a solid start?
Realistically, Juneau has been a scoring
bust since he came over from Boston in
1993.

The saving grace of this team, sur-
prisingly, could be their defense. The team
shouldn’t be in bad shape after the retire-
ment of Rod Langway, thanks to rising
stars Sergei Gonchar and Brendan VV1tt.
Add nine-year veteran Calle Johansson
and the “thirtysomething” mo of Mark
Tmordi, Sylvain Cote and Joe Reekie, and
you’ve got a tough bunch of blueliners.

quarterback) gaining only 79 rushing
yards.

With the offense faltering, the
Panthers tried trickery. On the second
play of the second drive, Dinkins took a
handoff from Gonzalez on an apparent
end-around, then turned to throw and
tossed an incompletion that was later
called back on a holding penalty. In the
second quarter, Schneider unloaded a
fullback option pass that landed harm-
lessly in the end zone despite a diving
effort from Jake Hoffart.

“Chris has become a very good,
diverse player for us,” said Majors. “He
made a wonderful effort there, but it
didn’t work out. Close doesn’t count.”

Chris Ferencik lined up for a 35-
yard ﬁeld—goa1 attempt after the failed
fullback pass, but he too wasn’t quite
on target. The two near-misses in a row
were the closest thing to scores the
Panthers managed all game.

Any doubt of the final outcome was

erased by Miami in the third quarter.

Ryan Clement completed his third
touchdown pass of the day, a 17—yarder
to Nick Williams, and was replaced by
Scott Covington. On his second snap,
Covington hit Gaiter for an 85—yar
score to make it 35-0 Miami. ‘
Miami’s quarterback shufﬂe took a
backseat early in the fourth, when
Zimmerman took his redshirt off and
started warming up on the sideline. He
would take his first snap as a Panther at
13:33 of the fourth, getting sacked for a

 FROM PAGE 12 

loss of five yards after fumbling a hand-
off.

His dubious start continued on the
second snap when he fumbled again
and lost eight yards. Billy West rushed
for five yards on the freshman’s third
play, mercifully ending a disastrous
first series. Zimmerman would not
complete a pass all game.

“It was one of the toughest deci-
sions of my career, frankly, to play
Tony Zimmerman,” said Majors. “No
reﬂection on the two quarterbacks in
the last few weeks, but we haven’t won.
What are we saving him for?”

Majors wouldn’t name a starter for
this Saturday’s homecoming contest
versus Temple, but said he would give

Zimmerman some practice in the _

upcoming contests.

For the second straight week, the
best statistics on the Panther squad
went to punter Nate Cochran. The
senior kicker averaged 47.5 yards on
six punts, including a 66-yard spiral
that pinned Miami deep in their own
territory. The Hurricanes responded to
bad ﬁeld position successfully all day;
averaging over 70 yards per scoring
drive.

Williams would lead the Panthers
in rushing, piling up 55 yards on ﬁve
carries. Miami fared better on the stat
sheet, with Ferguson amassing 117
yards rushing and Clement and
Covington combining for 353 yards in

Playoffs

Randy Myers, Baltimore’s pitch-
ing is suspect. ODDS — 8:1.

6. TEXAS RANGERS: Ranger
fans finally have something to root
for as Texas makes their first—ever
postseason appearance. Juan
Gonzalez, Will Clark, and compa-
ny will try to power past the
Yankees. With no real aces in the
pitching staff, the Rangers have
too many weaknesses this year.
ODDS — 10:1.

7. ST. LOUIS CARDINALS:
Cards’ manager Tony LaRussa’s
return to the playoffs gives him a
shot at winning a World Series.
Dennis Eckersley, Ron Gant and
Gary Gaetti’s playoff experience
should help the younger players.
The pitching staff, lead by Todd
Stottlemeyer and the Benes broth-
ers, may have to learn the hard
way. ODDS — 12:1.

8. SAN DIEGO PADRES: M-VP
Candidate Ken Caminiti carried
the Padres all year and will try to
do the same in the playoffs. Greg
Vaughn and Tony Gwynn are also
fearsome hitters. A shaky pitching
staff led by Joey Hamilton will
likely equate a quick playoff exit.
The Padres chances of winning the
World Series this year are about
the same as Neil O’Donnel1’s
chances of returning to the Super
Bowl. ODDS — 15:1. '

THE PI'l"I' NEWS

Atlantic-

The Lightning finally turned the cor-
ner last season, proving they won’t remain
the “Minnesota Timberwolves” of the
league. Coach Terry Crisp has been with
Tampa Bay since its inception and GM
Phil Esposito made the right move in
sticking with him.

-Crisp has earned the respect of the
NHL with his squad, instilling a rugged
toughness into his players. And with
emerging grinders Alexander Selivanov,
Chris Gratton and defenseman Roman
Hamrlik, this team can only get better.

6. New Jersey Devils (37-33-12, 6th)

Last year, the Devils became the first
team in league history to miss the playoffs
after winning the Stanley Cup the year
before. It can be conﬁrmed that 1995 was
a ﬂuke. How the NHL let a team of trap-
pers win a championship is beyond com-
prehension.

Netminder Martin Brodeur deserves
better. The ﬁft_h—year goalie went 34-30-
12 in ‘95—’96 with a 2.34 goals against
average. His durability ranks up there

_ with the likes of Grant Fuhr. The Devils

better do everything in their power to
keep him healthy.

' 7. New York Islanders (22-50-10, 7th)

If you’re looking for this season’s
lock, it’s the New York Islanders at the
bottom of the Atlantic (no pun intended).
This is a team brimming with prospects
and raw talent. But that’s the point.

D They’re a team of the future.

The Isles have two solid future all-

with 43 goals and 87 points. Add second-

talk about in the near future. ‘
