ew
lifting
rule

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

The next time you’re holding 350 pounds over
your head, don’t drop it. A new University rule
banned “weight dropping” A

The rule came into effect earlier this
month when one student'ﬁtness club found
itself homeless after the group’s powerlifting
workouts apparently caused structural damage
to a University building. A

Panther CrossFit, a student group known
for its high—intensity weight lifting and p1yo—
metric workouts, was banned from using the
Belleﬁeld Hall heavy—lifting gym after repeated
“weight dropping” caused a meter-long crack
in the ceiling ofthe Aerobics Room, located
beneath the gym.

The nearly 30'-‘person club started working: ’ I '

out in Belleﬁeld injanuary 2010, after being
barmed from working out in Trees Hall, said
former CrossFit vice president and trainer
Zach Miller. '

Ryan “Bonecrusher” Johnston, Panther
CrossFit president, described the group’s frus-
tration last week. He believes that CrossFit
members’ intensity and dedication in the gym
can be off—putting, especially for those used to
more traditional workout etiquette.

“I would deﬁnitely say our workouts can be
disturbing to others in the gym,”]ohnston said.
“When you’re struggling to get a few hundred
pounds of weight overhead you’re going to start
shouting, and of course the other club mem-
bers aren’t going to stand by quietly either.”

Johnston said the club was kicked out of
Trees Hall for their rowdy workouts, which is
how CrossFit wound up in Belleﬁeld in their
own room.

‘-‘We knew we were being disturbing, and
we were tryingto keep it down as much as pos-
sible,” Johnston said. “We just want to be left

When Kyle Kendrick is feeling patriotic,
it shows.

Kendrick, a student at the Community ’ A’

College of Allegheny County, hasalready
dyed his hair red and white in anticipa-
tion of Independence Day. This week, his
girlfriend, Pitt junior Laura Bilski, plans
to add the blue to his American ’do.

“I think he’ll get a lot of positive reac-
tion with his hair,” Bilski said. “I think
people will be really patriotic. That’s what
[the Fourth of July] is all about.”

Kendrick will ﬂaunt his new look at
Point State Park for the holiday, where
he and Bilski plan to take in the city’s
fireworks display. With no official events
planned for Independence Day in Oakland,
many Pitt students are planning to join the
patriotic pair Downtown to celebrate the
United States’ birthday.

The ﬁreworks at the Point will be the
largest display in Pittsburgh and will begin
Sunday at 9:35 p.m., marking the end of
EQT Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Regatta.
Pittsburgh’s regatta is a three—day festi-
val featuring music, boat racing and stunt
plane performances. The event is also the
largest inland regatta in the country and
one of the top 10 largest Independence Day
celebrations in the United States.

Last year’s attendance for the regatta
topped 500,000 spectators. Event spokes-
man Michael Dongilli expects even more
people to attend this year’s 33rd annual
celebration.

“We’re going to have at least that many
and more, because the Pirates are playing
the Phillies,” Dongilli said. He expects that
baseball fans in Pittsburgh will attend the

alone and have a place to work out at Pitt.”

Panther CrossFit received two cease and
desist letters from Pitt administrators onjune
15 and 16 — one from Gabriel Lambright, Pitt’s
campus ﬁtness coordinator, and another from
Marilyn Ross, the director of intramurals and
recreation. Other complaints were report-
edly ﬁled by members of Pitt’s faculty and
instructors who teach in the Aerobics Room,
the group’s blog said.

Miller said the ﬁrst letter reported that
“much damage” had occurred in Belleﬁeld
Hall because of heavy weight usage and that
no one is allowed to use the space in either
room until the ceiling in the Aerobic Room
is repaired. ’ A

The second letter effectively barmed weight
dropping anywhere on Pitt’s campus. Weight
dropping involves lifting a barbell to chest
height or above, then dropping the equipment
onto specially designed ﬂoor pads.

Anyone participating in weight dropping
at Pitt will be subject to punishment dictated
by the Us1i.ve‘§i£yJ1sd.ic.ia! Iéqasd. 139-S? §"=‘§d.i‘.‘

the letter. They can also expect to be escorted
off the premises by campus police.

Terry Milani, assistant director of stu-
dent activities, stressed that the club was not
banned from campus because they were be-
having irresponsibly. ‘ _ : V"

“This isn’t an us-vs-them issue,” Milani
said. “We were stuck between a rock and a
hard place. They are a legitimate and successful
club, but like many other campus club sports,
we just don’t have anywhere suitable for the
kind of lifting they do.” "1

It is unclear whether the weight dropping
ban will be extended to other clubs or classes
at Pitt, but Milani said such a move is likely.

Pitt offers an Olympic and powerlifting
class, which will continue in the fall. Both lift-
ing forms often involve weight dropping in
excess of 300 pounds. ‘ 51 »

. The technique of weight dropping-is? safe
when lifting ona ground ﬂoor or in abasement,
Miller said, but can damage upper, weaker
ﬂoors, like the one in Belleﬁeld gym. For that
reason, Panther Crpssfit members said they

think an outright ban is hasty. ~
“Pitt’s power lifting class teaches many 0

the techniques we do every day,” Miller said.

“Are they going to shut them down too?”

Ross said the decision to keep CrossFit out ,

of Belleﬁeld was made exclusively for safety
reasons.

“We don’t have a problem with CrossFit,”
Ross said. “We just don’t have a place on cam-
pus where we can put them. '

Belleﬁeld is avery old building, it just can’t _

take heavyweight dropping. We’re hoping they
might be able to ﬁnd a site near campus,”

CrossFit members are worried about ﬁnd-
inga new location. ‘

Options include renting space at Pittsburgh
CrossFit headquarters Downtown, a move
that could potentially qualify them for SGB
allocated ﬁmds, the group’s blog said.

SGB President Charlie Shull did not im-
mediately return requests for comment, but
Miller said Shull has been in close commu-
nication with CrossFit about ﬁnding a new
location.

Trustees select
Pitt’s new provost

Beeson to take‘ over provost post as Maher retires

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

The search for Pitt’s new provost is
oven

On Friday, Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg named Patricia Beeson, current vice
provost of graduate and undergraduate
studies, as Pitt’s next full provost and
senior vice chancellor.

Beeson will replace current provost
James V. Maher, who is returning to a fac-
ulty position after 15 years of acclimated
service, on Aug. 15. ‘

“This is a momentous occasion in Pitt’s
223-year history,” Nordenberg said fol-

lowing the announcement, which came -

during the annual board of trustees meet-
ing.

“Dr. Beeson has made tremendous
strides for our undergraduate and gradu-
ate students here at Pitt, and her nomi-
nation as provost will certainly continue
that legacy.”

.Nordenberg_.selected Beeson from a

list‘ ofsix ﬁnal nom_i'ne”_es. Five of those  ’
nominees were from institutions and ;‘

positions outside of Pitt, Nordenberg
said. ' _

, Beeson was the only candidate from
Pitt.

“It’s an honor to have been chosen to
succeed someone who has been such a
terriﬁc provost at such a terriﬁc univer-
sity,” Beeson said upon accepting the new
position, following a standing ovation
from the trustees.

“We have a wonderful future ahead of
us here at Pitt, and I’m thrilled to have
an opportunity to contribute even fur-
ther.” .

Beeson, for her part, has already con-
tributed more than 27 years of service to

Pitt, where her ﬁery red hair and friendly
demeanor set her apart as one of the Uni-
versity’s top administrators.

“Patty is one of the most impressively
capable people I have ever worked with
during my career,” Maher said. “I’m posi-
tive that legacy will continue.”

Beeson joined the Pitt community as
an assistant professor in the department
of economics in 1983, where she achieved
a tenured position in 1990. She also held a

a visiting faculty position at the University
‘ of Michigan and research support from

various institutions across the country.

The provost search started in Novem- T

ber 2009, when Maher first announced
his intentions to return to a faculty po-
sition in the physics and astronomy de-
partment. V

The process began with a pool of 150
applicants and nominees, compiled by a
special search committee commissioned

by Nordenberg. Through a process of

interviews and resume consideration,
that group was eventually narrowed to

,;six;fi,gr;alists, Beeson among~__the_rn_ H . ._.
" I _e ﬁnal decision was up to-No, _d“en-‘-

   

berg. T It was a tough one, he "said, but
Beeson’s skill as a high—level administra-
tor, combined with her unquestionable
dedication to the University, set her apart
from the other candidates.

“Under Patty’s watch we have continu-
ally increased both graduate and under-

graduate retention and graduation rates,” _

Nordenberg said. “We have seen our aver-

age SAT scores climb, and today over half

of our undergrads come from the top 10
percent of their class. I am sure that Dr.
Beeson has the ability, ambition, experi-
ence and values to serve as Pitt continues

its never—ending question to define itself

a the finest and most productive universi-
ties in the world.”

Get the summit
out of the city

y now it’s a familiar formula:
BUpon hearing it will host the
next G.-20 Summit, a city
rushes to train and build up its police
force to prepare forthe commotion.
Downtown areas come to resemble
police states with the myriad rows
of badges and shields. Then things
get really ugly. Protestors clad in
black show up in droves and wreak
havoc in the streets. Windows get
smashed, cop cars are vandalized,
and onlookers too often get caught
in the chaos. We’ve seen it happen
right here in Pittsburgh less than one
year ago. In Toronto, it happened
again.

Ostensibly the G—20 Summit
is a meeting place for the world’s
leaders to ﬁgure out just how they’ll
resolve this global economic and en-
vironmental quagmire. While policy
agendas ﬁirther, the wreckage the

summit carries is a more memorable

scar. For a city hosting the summit, it
seems more headache than honor.
All the policing in Toronto costs
taxpayers $80 million, while the fed-
eral government paid $120 million,
the Toronto Star reports. It’s still
too early to place an accurate dol-
lar amount on the damages done
to local businesses. While Toronto
mayor David Miller wanted the
leaders to meet at the more eas-
ily securable Exhibition Place, the
federal government pushed for the
Metro Toronto Convention Centre

V — some speculated this location

was “chosen to showcase Toronto’s
ﬁnancial district.

While the ﬁxation with prestige
continues, hosting the summit in
more remote, less damageable loca-
tions would save money and lessen
the chaotic aftermath that’s sure to
ensue. If cities want prestige, they
should vie to host the Olympics.

Forget the food  

pyramid

emember the food pyramid
Ryou were shown in elemen-

tary school? Did you ever
follow it?

The dietary guidelines advisory
committee’s report to the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture and De-
partment of Health and Human
Services recommend that the 2005
dietary guidelines should change.

The report includes changes in

A the areas of total calorie consump-

tion per day and the percentage
of recommended carbohydrates.

‘We’re not too worried. The new

guidelines and food pyramid don’t
seem likely to make a difference in
the country’s overall health.‘

‘ e ‘Even the committee itselfrecog-

nized that “there’s a big disconnect

' between dietary recommendations

and what Americans actually eat.”

‘But it also seems important to
note that these are just guidelines.
Trying to create a roadmap for how
all the diverse people in the country
should eat is basically impossible.

2’

'!A‘s.'cukw<Arnr;,«:1'.z:-v. m . - . - ¢ u . n r mu.-

For example, vegans have to ignore
the meat and dairy portions of the
food pyramid, and those that are
gluten intolerant must ignore much
of the carbohydrates portion. If
you’re looking to lose weight, you
probably shouldn’t eat the allowed
total consumption of 3,000 calories
per day for men. If you’re a college
student, you probably shouldn’t
restrict yourself to the 1,600 mini-
mum calorie intake per day recom-
mended for_women. After all, that’s
only a few beers.

A Because it’s so hard to make a
food pyramid and guidelines that
can ﬁt everyone, it would be more
beneﬁcial to have individualized
dietary guidelines. Whether these
would be determined by one’s
doctor or generated online by a
government site, individualized
dietary guidelines would be more
suitable for combating the coun-
try’s health problems by catering
to people’s speciﬁc characteristics

and needs.

FOREPLAY on wonns

Womencan touch 
themselves too

“Acting like a lady” doesn’t have to mean keeping your hands above your waist.

 
   

Leah Trimble
Columnist

Masturbation is wrongfully con-
sidered a gender-speciﬁc topic.

‘ Most women won’t even admit
to one another that they touch
themselves, whereas a majority
of society seems to accept male
openness when it comes to public-
ly announcing their dirty deeds.

Before I call up my guy friends,
I have to consider thatl might be
upsetting their precious “jerk
time.” I’m forced to schedule lunch
dates around their masturbation
schedules. It’s almost as if their

penises have their own appoint-

ment books with ﬁve—minute
blocks — providing they even
need that much time.

Most guys also aren’t hesitant

to admit they’ve watched porn in
their lifetime. I can say with com-
plete certainty that all of my male
friends would be willing to —— if

A they haven’t already —— discuss

with me their favorite websites,
types, stars and whatever other
graphic details they decided to
throw in for good measure. They
would probably even be able to
rattle off their list of top men’s
magazine issues.

Why is it that women don’t
share this lack of censorship when
it comes to their sexual solo ses-
sions? Some ladies even seem
appalled by the idea of female
masturbation, as if it’s something
that’s OK for only men to do.

A female friend approached me
a few days ago for advice, knowing
Iwouldn’t be ashamed to speak my
mind on the subject. She wanted to
surprise her long-time boyfriend

in bed. Almost jokingly, I noncha—
lantly replied “just lay in front of
him and touch yourself.” Her face
was indescribable. It was like a
mixture of surprise, disgust and
horror. She returned the shock by
telling me that she was n’t sure she
could go through with it, but that
she really wanted to. _

Do reactions like this stem from
the age-old societal pressures that
women must conform to tradition
and “act like a lady,” leaving things
to the imagination?

One guy I asked explained
that “when women admit to it’,
they tend to look as if they want
to ﬂaunt it, making them seem
slutty and easy. But they shouldn’t
freak out and overreact about it.

It’s natural.” Another one laughed _

and said, “I wish girls talked about
it more. I picture them stereotypi-

Harry Potter revives hope for humanity

Wizarding world of Harry Potter brought to the “muggle ” realm via new theme park

 
   

Katie Azzara
Columnist

Last week, I visited the village of
Hogsmeade, drank goblets full
of butterbeer and took a magical
journey with Harry Potter him-
self.

No, I didn’t ﬁnally get my let-
ter from the Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry inviting
me to begin the magical education
that I’ve always wanted, but I did
the next best thing: I took a trip
to the Wizarding World of Harry
Potter, the new amusement park at
Universal Studios in Orlando.

The park comes complete with
an entire village straight out of the
book series, including a majestic
replica of Hogwarts castle. For

Harry Potter fans, the theme park A

was one of the most anticipated
events of 2010.

But my visit was not without
difﬁculties. Iwoke up at 5 a.m. and
waited in an endless line of fervent
Harry Potter fans for hours on

June 18, which just so happened to
be the grand opening of the park.
Obsessive fans short on sleep,
crammed in lines and facing Flor-
ida’s summer heat hardly sounds
like a magical combination. But by
the end of the day, .I wasn’t disap-
pointed in the least. Everything
about the park, from the Dragon
Challenge roller coaster to the per-
fect replicas of stores like Zonko’s

gether. Despite the crowds and the
lines, the heat and the sleep depri-
vation, everyone at the park was in
the highest of spirits, and we were
all connected through a mutual
love — fanaticism, might be more

appropriate — for the world J.K. ~

Rowling created. Somehow, ev-
eryone managed to stay friendly,
patient and courteous despite the
long lines and the hot sun. And

over long lines, crowded rides
and strenuous heat would ruin
the fantasy.

For one day, I, and all of the
other fans that were present, for-
got about their stress, worries and
other “Muggle” problems and were
able to enter a world that had pre-
viously only existed in the pages of
books, movie screens and the best
of dreams. Something about being

a fantasy, no matter how impossible it might seem.”

joke Shop, Honeydukes Sweetshop
and Ollivander’s Wand Shop, was
the realization of any Potter fan’s
fantasy, myself included.

Yet it wasn’t until I was well
past the gates of this new world
that I realized that this theme park
was enchanting in more ways than
one. I_began to notice that The
Wizarding World of Harry Potter
had a way of bringing people to-

that, I think, is pretty unusual, at
least based on my previous amuse-
ment park experiences.

But there’s a simple explana-
tion behind this. All of us were
as close as we’d get to the wizard
world. We were reminded that it’s
never too late to live out a fantasy,
no matter how impossible it might
seem. The park was a dream come
truezfor some fans, and moping

in the land of Harry Potter seemed
to change people, at least tempo-
rarily, for the better. And whether
that change involved overcoming
their fear of adventure rides, like
my mother, who rode the thrill-
ing Forbidden Journey twice, or
just permitting some skimping on

\

couldn’t help but think there was '

a touch of magic involved.

Some, like me, had been Pot-
ter fans for literally half of their
lives. Others, even longer, while

‘some were newer to the series.

Potter fans from all around the
country showed up to celebrate
the opening of the park. Infants,
elementary schoolers, pre—teens
and teens, college students, par-
ents and grandparents alike were
all brought together to join in the
official opening of the Wizarding
World. ,'

That’s one of the unique traits
of Rowling’s genius: Harry Potter
appeals to so many age groups.

Of course, I am grimly aware
that the great hero of the wizard-
ing world is a ﬁctional charac-
ter. Yet I can’t help but feel that
Harry Potter is managing to save
the muggle world, too. And if not,
he has ‘deﬁnitely succeeded, and
will continue to succeed, in saving
the day for all of those who wish
to visit the Wizarding World of
Harry Potter.

Pittsburgh pilsners a plenty

Unique and locally—made microbrews can be found throughout the city.

 

 
  

Chris Neverman I Staff Photographer

Local brewers at the Church Brew Works in Lawrenceville show off their unique brews.

Brendan Coticchia
Staﬁ"Wri ter

_ For a city of relatively modest

size, the beer community today
in Pittsburgh is buzzing with ac-
tivity. -

It is the home of several micro-
breweries, such as the East End
Brewing Company in Homewood,
as well as numerous brewpubs -
microbreweries that double as res-
taurants — including the Church
Brew Works in Lawrenceville and
Hofbriiuhaus in the South Side.

But this wasn’t always the
case.

When the doors of the Penn-
sylvania Brewing Company ﬁrst
opened in 1989, craft brewing in
the United States was still in its
infancy.

In Pittsburgh, the introduction

‘of the Penn Pilsner by Tom Pas-

torius, founder of Penn Brewery,
assisted in laying the groundwork
for what has ultimately become
a nationwide upsurge in craft

brewing.

Even so, the situation just a few
years ago was quite different, ob-
served Scott Smith, founder of the
East End Brewing Company.

“When I moved back to Pitts-
burgh after being away for about
15 years, I found that while there
was a lot of good beer being
served, there wasn’t much being
offered locally.” Smith said.

“There really wasn’t a local
beer like what was being served
out West.”

Smith’s brewery, based out
of what had previously been an
abandoned warehouse nestled
on Susquehanna Street, began
operations in December, 2004
and, in the years that followed,

blossomed into one of Pittsburgh

craft brewing’s most unbridled
successes. ’ ‘

“My goal with the brewery at
ﬁrst was just to survive,” Smith
said, laughing. “But we ended up
growing a considerable following
through word—of-mouth.”

Perhaps most surprising is

Smith’s admission that he spends

' nothing on advertising the brew-

ery — quite astounding consid-
ering that, for many patrons,
even locating the brewery is a
challenge, as East End’s nonde-
script location is marked only by
a simple stencil stamped onto the
steel door of the building that it
occupies.

However, the runaway success
of East End Brewing Co._ has al-
lowed Smith to engage in several
other pursuits, most notably the
Keg Race, an event co—sponsored
by bike advocacy group Bike Pitts-
burgh, which just concluded its
sixth year in May.

“Basically, we deliver the ﬁrst
kegs of Pedal Pale Ale, our summer
beer, by bicycle and give everyone
who participates a free beer at
the end when we reach our des-
tination,” Smith explained. “The
catch, though, is that the only
people who know where they’re
going are the keg-pullers, so you
need to follow them.”

Smith noted that the 2010 ed_i- _ ‘

3 .

tion of the Keg Race had seen the
strongest turnout yet, with 700
people in attendance. He added
that the ride is also used to “high—
light sustainability” because the
trip generates almost no solid
waste.

While small ventures such as
East End might seem to put the
micro in microbrewery, Steve
Panos, brewmaster of Home-
stead’s Rock Bottom Restaurant
8: Brewery, said that beer enthu-
siasts don’t necessarily need to
be frightened of the big bad wolf
commercial beer.

“Even the corporate brewpub
has its place,” Panos said.

Althoughlthe Homestead brew-
pub is part of a chain that includes
roughly two dozen separate loca-
tions, Panos stressed that “when
dealing with a local market, you
can’t justsell the same beer ev-
erywhere.”

“We don’t .have any sort of
‘corporate recipe.’ "Each brewery
operates independently of the

Eclipse
a lame
sequel

Bethie Girmai
Staﬁ"Writer

As a general rule, sequels to ﬁlms
pale in comparison to their origi-
nal counterparts. The “Twilight”
series has now perfected what was
once just a rule into an unfailing
art form.

As if the screenplays of “Twi-
light” and “New Moon” weren’t
bad enough, “Eclipse” sunk the
series to a new low. Fans will de-
light at the resurrection of Kristen
Stewart’ pained facial expressions,
Robert Pattinson’s ability to convey
emotion from his eyes and Taylor
Lautner’s bulging pectorals.

However, two hotties and a
mediocre, mute actress aren’t the
ingredients for a quality movie.

The plot of “Eclipse” is centered
on an army of newborn vampires
whose purpose is to destroy the
Cullen clan. In the interest of our
resident damsel in distress’ safety,
the werewolves form an alliance
with the vampires. Predictably, a
climatic struggle ensues between
the newborns and what I like to
call “Bella’s B*tches.”

However, the plot is probably
the ﬁlm’s smallest problem. As I
mentioned before, the “Twilight”
series isn’t exactly known for its
stellar screenplay. But in this
monstrosity of an installment, the
producers seemed to ﬁnd a solu-

V tion to this said issue. Every time

the dialogue turned weak, Taylor
Lautner seemed to ﬁnd a pseudo
reason to go shirtless. Which begs
the question: Does Taylor Lautner
even own a shirt?

Furthermore, I was disappoint-
ed to see the tension between Ed-
ward and Jacob ﬁzzle out. Their
feud came to a head in a scene that
suspiciously paralleled another
box-oflice hit from a few years
back. I’ll give you a hint: Edward
andjacob hide Bella in a secluded
section of forest, pitch a tent and
sleep in the tent with her. Edward

Plot sucks

and Jacob make somewhat of a truce and
share a moment of smirks and heated stares.
’ I couldn’t tell if they were going to ﬁght,
paint each other’s nails or start making out.
David Slade, the director of “Eclipse,” obvi-
ously forgot about Ang Lee’s “Brokeback
Mountain.” Sorry guys, you’re no Heath and
Jake. V

The problems above are just a few of sev-
eral problems in this movie. Not-only is the
acting terrible, but the casting also left some-
thing to be desired. For example, Dakota
Fanning is not believable as ablood—sucking
demon — honey, we all saw you in “The Se-
cret Life of Bees.” Billy Burke’s, portrayal of
Charlie Swan served as comic relief. But in
a movie where Billy Burke is the highlight,
there’s not much hope. — B

Regardless of how technically terrible the
movie is, there won’t be a shortage of fans lin-
ing up outside theaters in their Team Edward
and Teamjacob T-shirts. If you’re looking for
some quality romance, go elsewhere.

If you’re looking for some action, again,
go elsewhere, because werewolf/vampire
ﬁghts aren’t all that entertaining.

However, if you’re looking for jailbait with
an unnaturally sculpted body, “Eclipse” is
your movie. I would have complained a lot
less if I had sat through a three—hour still
picture of a nearly naked Taylor Lautner.

Nicole Atkins performed live at WYEP’s music festival on Friday in Schenley Plaza.

Microbrews 4 7

Local beer community  

Brewers aren’t your average cornpetitrlve business men

others and makes its own unique brews,”
he said.

Panos explained this approach by us-
ing the example that “in Pittsburgh,‘ you’re
going to sell a lot of lagers and German-
inﬂuenced beers. And while there is a niche
market for them, drinkers here aren’t near-
ly as hop-crazy as the IPA producers on the
West Coast.”

While the ownership of Rock Bottom
set it apart from independent breweries
such as East End or Penn, Panos said that
“any brewery, corporate or not, has a lot
of potential.”

‘ “There’s a lot of market share out there
for everyone, and beer’s not the kind of in-
dustry where you’re trying to eat everyone
up. It’s very communal.”

Indeed, the communal aspect of brewing
is one of the areas where Smith and Panos
share similar views, particularly the unique

form that it has taken on in Pittsburgh.

“It deﬁnitely seems to be growing here,”
Panos said. “There are a lot of bars out
there that really care about carrying good
beer, and when you compare Pittsburgh’s
brewing community to a city the size of,
say, Chicago, which only had a few brew-
eries despite being much larger, it really
brings things into focus.”

Smith, on the other hand, emphasized

the impact of the Internet in creating a
local network of beer enthusiasts, which

has evolved alongside organizations such
as Pittsburgh Craft Beer.
However, Smith added that while there

is no experience quite like sharing a good

brew with friends, he feels “beer is some-
thing very personal.”

“It’s something that you ingest into your
body. What could be more personal than

that?”

Sports helped teenager cope, teach

Challis 4 1

and supervisors.

“But that didn’t mean noth-
ing to him compared to when
he went out and shot one on his

".r1;OWn,” Scott said.

One chilly November after-
noon, a few weeks before John
finally got to play in a football
game, he called his dad at work
and shouted, “Dad, I got one!”

A sportsman’s club donated

‘Via crossbow to John and he took

it out into the woods by himself
and shot a 10-point deer. The
arrow didn’t immediately kill
the deer, so John had to track it
through the woods, down over

tea big hill, before he found the

dead animal. By then his cancer
was Stage IV. _

“That meant the most to him,”
Scott said. “Because he did it,
and nobody else helped him.”

n,._ John’s other sports adventures

included a trip to Yankee Stadium
to meet the Yankees players and

former New York Mayor Rudy
Giuliani, attending a Penguins
playoff game and meeting the

team and Mario Lemieux. He also

met the Pirates and Steelers.

“He did more than most
people do in two lifetimes,”
Scott said. “And that kept him
going.”

It was all of these experiences
that kept John going toward his
ultimate goal — graduating high
school with his class.

IfJohn knew that he was going
to meet the Penguins in a month,
then he knew he had to work to-
ward being healthy enough to
attend the game and meet some
of his heroes, Scott said.

_ Using sports as a way to rise
above the fear and pain that ill-
nesses bring can be an effective
coping strategy.

Stephen Russo, director
of sports psychology at Nova
Southeastern University, ' said

fans that associate themselves
with the team frequently have
an emotional response to wins
and losses.

“Being a fan in their mind is
being associated with the team,”
he said. “And they experience the
highs and lowsright along with
the team.”

If a fan experiences those
highs, he or ‘she can find the
strength to heal and cope, he
said. The people who manage to
find strength in sports are often
inspirational to others, and it is
tough to ﬁnd someone more in-
spirational than John Challis.

On every one ofJohn’s sports
adventures he gave speeches and
advice to the people he met.

' When he visited the Pirates, he

gave a speech to the team in the
locker room.

“He talked to them about how
this could be taken away from
you at any given time,” Scott

 

said. “You could hear a pin drop
in the locker room.”

One week before his death,
John told Ben Roethlisberger at
Steelers training camp, “Don’t
take this for granted.”

John was never star struck
when he met someone famous.

“They were people just like
he was,” Scott said. “We were
in A—Rod’s penthouse and John
was asking him questions like a
normal conversation.” '

“A-Rod called here about a
week and a half before [John]
died, andjohn hung up the phone

.with him,” Scott said. “He just

told him, ‘Hey, I gotta go.”’

But he was always respectful
to everyone that he met.

“Everybody was Mr. or Ms. to
him,” Scott said. “Mr. Roethlis-
berger, Mr. Lemieux.”

He met Pitt’s star wide receiv-
erJon Baldwin while Baldwin was
a senior standout at Aliquippa

 

-.:..-- u .1.» :_.'.’.':;-..-;a_<"'i .. .2

High School. John and Balwdin
both graduated high school in
2008, so John was speaking to
his peer when talking to Baldwin,
but he still referred to him as Mr.
Baldwin.

“[Baldwin] was such an elite,
great high school athlete. John
gave him the respect he thought
he deserved,” Scott said.

John never showed any fear.
One -of his favorite quotes was

1 from aJohn Wayne movie: “Cour— .

age is being scared to death but
saddling up anyway.”

“For an 18-year-old kid know-
ing he could die’ any minute, he
was so strong,” Scott said.

Scott said, Freedom isn’t very
good at football. John gave the

team a speech before its game ‘

against their rivals, Elwood
City.

Under his baseball cap that
he wore frequently, he had in-
scribed, “Courage + Believe =

Panthers improving at summer league

Gary McGhee dominates for his team, others focus on improving specific aspects of their game

Kelly Flanigan
Staff‘ Writer

For the Pitt men’s basketball team, summer
doesn’t mean vacation.

Just ask Gary McGhee, who led his sum-
mer league team with 22 points and 15 re-
bounds Monday. McGhee —— along with
the rest of the team —- has to balance his
summer with classes, conditioning and
basketball games. 1

Pitt forward Nasir Robinson seems to
be beneﬁting from his work-ﬁlled summer
as well. He scored 16 points while playing
against half his teammates. ’

“Summer league is good competition
for the team. These are guys we play against
every year,” he said. “It’s agood ‘chance for
us to come out and play our game every
night like we do during the season.”

The ﬁrst game of the night featured
three Panthers on either side of the ball.

Brown, Chase Adams and Talib Zanna
battled for The Lair.

The game was a competitive in the be-

ten.

Zanna battled hard on the boards to
collect 10 rebounds and 14 points, while
Brown excited fans with a block against the
backboard and several high-ﬂying dunks.
He shot 3-of-6 from behind the 3-point line
and ﬁnished the game with 23 points.

Duquesne freshman T.J. McConnell
scored 22 points for The.Lair.

In the second half, though, Robinson
stood out for SPK Law. He ﬁnished with
16 points after shooting 6 for 11 from the
ﬁeld.

Nasir Robinson:

Moore had 16 in the team’s losing effort.

PGT 74 vs. P&W Motors 68

Though the score indicates only a six-
point differential, the second game of the
night was dominated from start to ﬁnish
by the winning team: PGT.

Gary McGhee led PGT with 22 points,
15 rebounds and a single turnover. He con-
verted 10-of-17 shots from the ﬁeld.

Lamar Patterson had 12 points and sev-
en rebounds to contribute to the win. All
eyes were on freshman Cam Wright again
as he shot 4-of—11 from the ﬁeld and had

Summer league is good competition for the

team.

“My focus this summer has been a lot
on conditioning, ball handling and just
overall working on my shot, especially my
free throws,” Robinson said. A

Monday’s contest.

For P&W Motors, the Pitt players were
quiet. Dwight Miller posted four points,
while Nick Rivers collected two rebounds
and an assist, but no points. .

Instead, the team was led by forme
Robert Morris forward Dallas Green, who

shot 8 for 14 from the ﬁeld and collected
22 points.

In the end, however, McGhee’s domi-
nant performance underneath was too
much for P&W Motors to stop.

Center Court 73 vs. UPMC 72

Pitt fans watched as familiar faces
Ashton Gibbs competed for Center Court
and Travon Woodall competed for UPMC
in what seemed to be a shooting show-
down. ,

Gibbs ﬁnished the game with 25 points
and shot 4-11 from behind the arc. Woodall
sank 22 points, made all eight of his foul
shots and shot 7-13 from the ﬁeld.

Robert Morris’ Russell Johnson made
19 points and put on a very impressive
performance for Center Court.

Other Pitt players present were J.J. Rich-
ardson, who scored seven points for Center
Court, and Dante Taylor, who put up 11
points and grabbed nine rebounds.

The Richardson-Taylor matchup was
certainly a point of interest for Pitt fans to
watch, as well as Taylor’s progression from
last season to this summer, especially in
terms of his communication with his team-
mates and his overall ﬂoor presence.

All six teams will return to action to-
night at the Greentree Sportsplex.

Challis helps

others through sports

Foundation sends sick children on sports adventures

Life.”John used that notion in the locker
room to encourage his teammates to be-
lieve in themselves.

“There wasn’t a dry eye in the locker
room,” Scott said. He remembered think-
ing, “This ain’t an 18-year-old kid talk-
ing.” And Freedom won that night.

“People tell me he was a messenger
from God,” Scott said. “I’ll tell ya what,
I believe it.”

john’s story soon made it all the way
across the country. He was featured in
Sports Illustrated.

The Versus channel interviewed him
on national television, and'ESPN’s “Out-
side the Lines” proﬁled him. The Challis
family is also in talks with a movie pro-
ducer about making a ﬁlm about john’s
inspiring life. Scott Challis said that this
media exposure helped to inspire others,
and the family received plenty of letters
in the mail conﬁrmingjohn’s inspiration
toward others.

“People sent baseballs from all over
the country,” Scott said. “Someone even
sent us dirt from the ﬁeld where ‘Field
of Dreams’ was ﬁlmed.”

John achieved his goal of graduation,

but after that, the cancer took over. To
the end he was aware that he was dying.
When a worker from hospice care came
to his house in the summer of 2008, he
said, “I know why you’re here. You’re here
to make my last days easier for me.”
, One day that summer john was bun-
dled up in a blanket because he was so
cold, and he sat his father down to tell
him something very important.

“I will wear my white football game
jersey and my letterman jacket in the

‘ casket,”]ohn told his father. “Don’t screw

this up.” i

His burial clothing wasn’t the only
thing he was planning while he was dy-
ing.

He realized how beneﬁcial sports
were to him in battling cancer, and he
wanted other kids in his situation to be
able to go on sports adventures similar
to the ones he enjoyed.

So John and his baseball coach got
together and laid out the groundwork for
thejohn Challis Courage for Life Founda-
tion which helps send high school ath-
letes with life-threatening illnesses on
sports adventures.

Scott said that the Make—a-Wish
foundation allows you to only have one
experience, so if a child is awarded an
adventure through the Courage for Life
Foundation, then he or she cannot take
a Make-a-Wish trip.

“We tell people to take their Make— I

a-Wish trip ﬁrst, so it wouldn’t deprive
them from my son’s trip,” Scott said.

The ﬁrst recipient of a sports adven-
ture from the Courage for Life Founda-
tion was Taylor Dettore, a former tennis
player at Neshannock High School. She
also has cancer and she met john at the
hospital the night that john found out
about his own cancer. . ,

The Courage for Life Foundation treat-
ed Dettore to dinner, a hotel stay and a
limo ride to a Penguins playoff game last
year. When she arrived at Mellon Arena,
the Penguins gave her an autographed
Evgeni Malkin jersey.

Her cancer has been in remission for
two years.

- “I know my son is looking down to tell
us we did the right thing to make her the
first recipient,” Scott said.

Through sports,John lived out many
of his dreams before he died _— and he
used every opportunity to teach people
about life. i

He often told the people he met, “It’s
not how many breaths you take, it’s what
you do with each breath you do take.”
