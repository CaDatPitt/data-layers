Men’s Council
Plans Dance
F or Christmas

The Christmas Dance Commit-
tee of l\/Ien’s Council last week an-
nounced ﬁnal plans for this year's
All University Christmas Ball to
be held on December 8, from 9
p.m. to midnight in the Cathedral
Commons Room.

Music for dancing will be pro-
vided by Ernie Bastin and his or-
chestra. This group is well known
on the University oi‘ West Virginia
Campus where they have played

at numerous functions in and
around Morgantown.
The band is composed of 14

members. including a female vo-
calist who will render Christmas
selections throughout the evening.
“This dance will be the high-
light of the school season,” com-
mented Charles Lucas. general
dance chairman, “Anybody who
is anybody on campus will be
there.”

“I want to invite all students.
fraternity members, graduate stu-
dents, and especially freshman to
this dance, for this is the only
dance of the school year for all
the University community.”

The Christmas Dance, tradition-
ally formal in the past, was
changed last year to semi-formal
after a poll of the students re-
vealed that there would be a sign-
niﬁcant increase in attendance if
the change were enacted,

Semi-formal dress has been
deﬁned by the Dance Committee
as dark,’ conservative suits for
men and cocktail dresses for

_ women.

Tickets for the dance will cost
$2.75 and will be on sale at the
SU Desk, the Student Desk in the
Cathedral, the Student Desk in
Scaife Hall, in the Men’s Council
Office i:n 311 Student Union. and

from all Men’s Council members.

When asked her reasons
this move. Miss Teeters refused
to comment.

Sobota Speculates

SG president Rich Sobota said
that while he could only speculate
about Miss Teeter's motives, he
did “not believe that her resigna-
tion was prompted by any of the
activities of previous weeks.”

Sobota was referring to a re-
cent Senate meeting at which
Miss Teeters charged the SG
executive branch as lacking in
cooperation and coordination.

Mentioning that Miss Teeters
has not been in good health late-
ly, Sobota said “I think Pat left
her position because of her pro-

longed illness, not because of per-
sonal repercussions.
Fingeret is Capable

She has evidently found that
Jay Fingeret is entirely capable
of presiding over Senate meetings
and decided that she must resign
in favor of her health.”

Miss Teeters was elected to the
vice—presidency last February as
an independent candidate. In ad-
dition to her normal duties as
Senate president, she has worked
with the SG Parents Weekend
duirng the early part of this term
and helped to plan a program for
foreign students in conjunction
with the Ofﬁce of Cultural and
Educational Exchange.

A member of Mortar Board. a
senior mentor, and ﬂoor counselor.
she is also president of Delta

A lormletfr-er is being sent to
various schools asking‘ for in...
formation that will help the Al-

At ThLu'sclay‘s Committee meet-

Dresident. and one represen/tative
each from IFC. Men’s Council,
and Panhellenic Council discuss-
ed and approved the form.

They also talked about the na-
ture of bevera.{;es that would be
permitted beer or liquor in
general, and where it would be

served —— fraternity houses’ and
men's dorms. Nothing was decided
about the student Union, “We

don’t want to get involved in

either the selling or the serving

of alcohol.” Sobota commented.
Question Age Limit

Since the University is state-
subsidized. the letter. which will
be sent to major schools and uni-
versities on a list approved by the
committee. asks the school in

and what the state has set as the

The letter also inquires as to
the nature of beverages served,
where and when they are serv-
ed, to whom they are served.
arm whether or not chape:-ro>n<es

The committee also wants to
know the history of alcoholic reg»-
ulations at the school. how long
provisions for drinking have been
in existence, whether action on
the problem was initiated by stu-
dents or faculty. and if any
changes in the schools policy are
anticipated.

Finally, the letter asks for com.-

“l't’s my feeling‘ that many "men
‘want to stay because they have

to do a great number of term
papers,” he said. “This is a real
need; they wouldn’t give up going
home for the holiday unless they
really had work to do. We may
have to look into keeping the halls
open during Tl.1zml<sgi\7irig in the
future.”

Last year all rnen’s halls were
closed during the Thanksgiv-
ing recess. The main problem
is that staff members want the
holiday, Whalen said. This year

several ﬂoor counselors are
staying in the dorm during
Thanksgiviiig. Whaler: h a s

worked closely on the problem
with Helen Rush, the Dean of
‘Women.
ll/liss Rush explained that ac-
cording to the established con~
tract, the dormitories for women
will be closed and staff members
will take a. holiday.
Arrangements have been made,
she added, for graduate women
and those from foreign countries
to remain on campus. Along with
11 undergraduates who cannot go
home because of various reasons,
they will be housed in Bruce Hall.
The dormitories will re—open to

Doctor Urges
Diabetes Check

Dr. T. S. Danowski, professor
of medicine at the University and
a member of the national council

of theVAmerican Diabetes Asso-

ciation, has called attention to
Diabetes Detection Week.

“If anyone in your family’ has
diabetes,” he said, “your chance
for getting this condition is great-
ly i_ncreased..”

Diabetes, which ranks seventh
in the country as a cause of
death, develops when the body
cannot use certain foods, partic-
ularly sugars and starches.

Although diabetes is usually de-
tected in people over age 48, Dr.
Danowski suggests that students
should check with their "families,

and if 2.: history of diabetes exists, ‘

take tests for diabetes annually or
whenever seriously ill.

Early detection of diabetes leads
to a longer life and to easier con-
trol of the disease. Dr. Danowski
estimated that over one million
Americans unknowingly have dia-
betes.

He said that the tests for
betes are simple ones and that
checks by students into their tam-’
ily histories should not be re-
stricted to parents, brothers and
sisters, but should include grand~
parents, aunts, uncles. and cous-
ins.

Diabetes Detection Week was
held November 12 through 18.

Teeters Tatters

The resignation of Pat Teeters, who has been one of
the strongest advocates of Student Government, symbolizes
SG’s losing battle for existence. _

As demonstrated by her work in the past, Miss Teeters‘
has been one of the most active and unifying forces in SG
since her election as vice president last year. , I

During the summer term she upheld her duties as presi-
dent of the Senate by holding weekly meetings withthe
senators on campus and took on most of the responsibility
of the organization when the president, Rich Sobota, could
not be contacted.

I It was Pat Teeters who laid much of the groundwork
for Parents’ Weekend by sending out letters and working
with the committee inplanning the three—day program.

It was also Pat Teeters who helped plan a program for
foreign students with the Office of Cultural and Educational
Exchange and other campus organizations whereby dances
and informal get-togethers were scheduled to help orient
the foreign student to university life. I

These are only some of the achievements of Pat Teeters
during the nine months she has “been in office. These are
the achievements SG should be.proud of for the)’ Show

it?” what can be accomplished by senators and leaders who are

willing to put. in the time and energy for the students and
for the University.

* =t= *

Miss Teeters’ failure to comment on her resignation
leaves much to speculation, but on looking over the past
several months it’s not too difficult to piece together what
has happened. _

Individually, Pat Teeters has succeeded in whatever she
has endeavored, but SG as a whole has been unable to pull
itself together for effective action. Aside from the Pep Com-
mittee it has not found one concrete issue on which to con-

I centrate.

The failure of the Syracuse bus and the recent Meet
Your Senator meetings demonstrate the lack of initiative
and action on the part of the public relations committee as
well as other committees cited by the senators themselves.
If Pat Teeters is discouraged, it is no wonder. The presi-
dent of the senate should be a co—ordinator not the initiator.
Becoming bogged down in the work of senators could cer-
tainly disillusion any executive no matter what his orig-
inal ideas.

But Student Government has not been strong on cam-
pus for a number of years. While she could_ not be ex-
pected to know exactly what her position as vice president
entailed, Pat Teeters should have realized that her responsi-
bility would not be an easy one. Any important position
has problems which often seem unfair and all out of per-
spective, but quitting in mid-stream never solved anything.

Pat Teeters’ discouragement and disillusionment can be
understood and sympathized with, but her failure to accept
these obstacles once they were realized and to attempt to
overcome them cannot be commended. In fact, her fail-
ure to clarify why she has resigned is one of the most dis-
appointing factors in this issue. It’s true Miss Teeters does
not have to justify her position, but it is just as true that
she owes an explanation to those students who elected her
last spring. '

* * * ‘

If Pat Teeters has honestly re—appraised the situation
and feels that she can no longer give the time to an organi-
zation she feels is not worthwhile, it is her responsibility

as a student leader to point out where she feels SG is

failing and why.

There’s little doubt that Jay Fingeret has the ability to
fill the position vacated by Miss Teeters. but how much
stronger could SG be if they worked together not in place
of one another.

The problem presented here is twofold. SG appears

Schlesinger Speaks

By Nathan Firestone

Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. is an extremely per- ‘

suasive man. He is also Special Assistant to the
President. These two points have a direct correla-
tion, and if ‘Schlesinger appears as persuasive to
Mr. Kennedy as he did to reporters. who interview-
ed him at a press conference before his speaking
engagement last Wednesday eve-
ning, then I have supreme con-
ﬁdence in executive policy deci-
sions. .

Above all else, Mr. Schles-
inger is a “civilized man.” He is
civilized in the sense that he
has an extensive background of
scholarship to shape his deci-
sions. He appears to have a cer-
tain ability to emphasize with
the various elements in the
country affected by U. S. policy.
This was” so obviously lacking during the Eisen-
hower Administration-. Mr. Eisenhower was able to
empathize with Arnold Palmer, and Richard Nixon
could’ picture himself in Chiang Kai-Shek’s shoes,
but, apparently, this is as far as it went.

This ability to empathize is especially impor-
tant in dealing with the “emerging nations”, and
the comments of Mr. Schlesinger clearly illustrated
that our policy was being shaped intelligently.

Professor Schlesinger shows an obvious under-
standing of the attraction of communism to a de-

veloping area as “a short cut to development”, and ~

the administration‘s policy is being shaped to com-
bat this attraction. This realistic attitude is quite
a contrast to the pious but meaningless comments
of John Foster Dulles concerning the moral attri-
butes of capitalism versus communism.

Lights and Relights

Pausing occasionally _to light and relight a
long cigar (there was much speculation as to
whether or not it was Cuban), Mr. Schlesinger an-
swered a battery of questions ranging from unem-
ployment to war.

His answers ranged from an optimistic outlook
on business conditions to a rather guilty, unsatisfy-
ing retort to his part in the Cuban invasion. “It is
part of the American tradition to sympathize with
exiles wanting to return to their homeland,” said
Mr. Schlesinger.

Nevertheless, he had an impish grin on his face
as he reported that, “Castro’s inﬂuence in Latin
America has been steadily declining.”

He returned to a more serious attitude, as he

explained what college students “can do for their»

country.” He mentioned such things as prepared-

 
  

 

lic service, joining the Peace Corps, and perhaps

most diﬂicult of all, “The challenge to individuals

to determine what they can that will be in the best

interests of their country.”

Mr. Schlesing then turned to the CIA, as he ex-
plained that the best way to make it more effective
would be “to make it an instrument of complete
anonymity}? , .

He was obviously well prepared to field a ques-
tion on recognition of Red China, and said that he’
agreed with the administration view because he
“is a member of the administration.”



 

 

Later, the Pulitzer Prize winning historian I

(The Age Of Jackson, 1945) spoke to the Pitts-
burgh Chapter of the ADA at the Hebrew Institute
Auditorium. His theme was “The New Frontier . . ,
A Report for 1961".

Mr.Sch1esinger outlined the steps taken by the, '

administration for progressive domestic legislation
such as medical care for the aged, integrated hous-
ing, recessed area aid, and then turned to the field
of foreign policy. “The New Frontier is striving for
the spread of liberal democracy versus. commu-
nism”, said Professor Schlesinger, and he pointed
to the Alliance For Progress in Latin _AmeriCa,

Takes Broad Swipes

His address was accentuated by some ratheri
broad swipes at the conservative movement in the
United States, referring to Senator Goldwater as}.
“the darling of the left-wing of the John Birch So-
ciety.”

“Senator Goldwater,” said Mr. Schlesinger,” is
so handsome that a movie co/mpany is scoutinghim.
18th Century Fox.”

Mr. Schlesinger is probably typical of the other
Kennedy advisors such as Rostow and Bundy.
There is no doubt that they are intellectuals, for
the entire New Frontier is intellectually oriented.

But the important thing to remember is that
these are the “new intellectuals”, who are putting
their learning to work in the realm of policy-
making. Such books as W. W. Rostow’s The Stages
of Economic Growth, are good examples of this, as
as academic thoroughness is
thoughtful proposals for policy implications.

The fear that these intellectuals “do not have
their feet on the ground” is not justified, for they
are realistic thinkers, and their decisions reflect
this. Schlesinger reafﬁrmed how committed the
United States was to the defense of South Viet-
nam, and if this is indicative of administration
thinking on a global level, as I am sure it is, then
there should be no fear of these people advising
the President to surrender the country.

Peace Walk Defended
By SANE President

Editor, The Pitt News,

The editor of The Pitt News,
in her recent editorials on the
Inquiry Club and the Student
Peace Walkers has grossly un-
derestimated the political per-
ception and maturity of the stu-
dent body which The Pitt News
is supposed to represent.

It is surprising that the staff
of our newspaper, instead of
taking the lead in encouraging
and supporting students in their
efforts to join in meaningful, or-
ganized political inquiry and ac-
tivity, sees ﬁt to editorialize
against it-

The editor has suggested in

Monday’s editorial on the Stu- ~

dent Peace Walk that individual,
rather than group action, is the
most effective way for students
to deal with political problems.
It mentions speciﬁcally that we
should improve our personal re-
lationships with the foreign stu-
dents at Pitt —- each of us be-
coming an “individual good will
ambassador.”

Fine! But this is certainly not
incompatible with a morepublic
demonstration of our convictions.
The role played by foreign stu-
dents in their own countries has
certainly been far from an in-
conspicious and ineffective one.

If anything has impressed the
foreigngstudents at Pitt, it has
been exactly the kind of senti-

ment and activity displayed by
the Peace Walkers last Saturday.
What’ is most important, how-
ever, is that Peace Walkers help-
ed show ‘some of those unin-
formed or misinformed citizens
of our city who view the digging
of holes in the ground amidst
discussions of the ethics of shoot-
ing one’s neighbors at the shelter
door —— those citizens, like the
author of the editorial, “Home
Life,” who View the pitiful de-
gradation of everything decent
‘that we are trying to preserve in
the ﬁrst place —— as a “positive”
approach to the problem facing
us, that there are people whom
they can join who see that real-
istic steps consonant with our
nation’s highest ideals can be
taken toward peace.

Student Says Peace
Walking Tops CD
Editor, The Pitt News,

Your recent editorial, “Home
Life,” seems to indicate that you
Were not at all familiar with the
purpose of the Peace Walk
which you so freely criticized.
T h e students who marched
through Pittsburgh on November
11 did so as a part of a nation-
al student peace movement to
stimulate thought throughout the
country.

Although it ‘is true that people

do not want a nuclear war, it is

equally true that they are not‘

directing their efforts to promote
peace. Those who were at one
time worried about the possibil-
ity of a war are now more con-
cerned about survival in an in-
evitable nuclear conflict.

This is the result of the false
security provided by Civil De-
fense. As long as people feel
that they can survive a nuclear
war they will not fear a Third
World War.

You maintained in your edi-
torial that Civil Defense is a
means of preparation. When it is
considered that all sources of
food would be contaminated, that
we will have no communication,
transportation or sanitation, and
that the whole social structure
of society will collapse, it be-
comes clear that we are prepar-
ing Only for death from second-
ary radiation, epidemic, and
starvation. , .

Evidentally you have confused
theyaims and objectives of Civil
Defense with those of the peace
walk. It is the campaign of Civil
Defense which is leading to hys-
teria. The students who marched
through Pittsburgh distributing
leaflets and carrying signs on
Armistice Day did so to make
People realize that ‘there will be
no survivors of the Third World
War and, to encourage them to

.work for peace.

Tackle Downs O'Brien
For “Lacking Insight"

Editor, The Pitt News,

During the course of each and
every season I look forward to
reading the kindly, sometimes
critical, but never vicious com-
Pittsburgh's
writers in their daily columns.

ments of sports-

I have never know! one of

tliuii to violate the indefatigable
sense of fair play which typiﬁes
the unique world of the athlete,
the world in which sportswriters
live and make their living up
until now, that is.

Or maybe I wouldn". be dis-
‘ lusioned it‘ I assumed that The
Pitt News had no other title than

Sports Editor to plac... at the
head of Jim O’Brien‘s Column.

O'Brien started his column of
November 1.) with a ﬁne disser-
tation on the “Italian Influence
in the World of Music" and he
would no doubt have shown
sufficient insight in that ﬁeld if,
he had continued as such. As a
result, however, we get nothing
from O’Brien but the poorest at-
tempt to try to shuffle off the
loss of the Notre Dame game on
only one individual.

I have the greatest respect for
constructive criticism and the
utmost admiration for the donor
of such. I have also learned to
be kind to my eleven—year-old
brother when he tells me how
all the great linemrn should
block.

I know very little about “The
Italian Influence in Music” but
I do know that every play which
is run on the gridiron is, theor-
etically, a touchdown play if ev-
ery player fulfills his assign-
ment. ,

I also know that the coaches
can point out thirty mistakes

effort. The team wins and the
team loses. My eleven-year-old
brother has already learned that
lesson. As a team member, I will
be able to read “Why We Lose”
on Wednesday but my sense of
fair play would not permit me to
remain silent when an individual
was maliciously belittled for a
team loss.

My impression of a proficient
individual in any field is that. of
one who shows a good, it‘ not ex-
ceedingly great insight into his
field of endeavor. I have seen
O’Brien in the Field House, I
have seen him on each trip the
football team has made and I
have seen him in the locker
room after every game. His col-
umns. however, do not exuberate
any exceedingly great insight in-
to his ﬁeld of endeavor.

I sincerely hope that the fu-
ture will again permit me to look
forward to reading constructive
criticism by our Pittsburgh
sportswriters without the fear of
being faced with the malicious
drivel any intelligent reader so
greatly abhors.

Meetings ‘Clear Up Misconceptions.’ ’

 

  

Biologist Expresses

‘Appreciation’

By MATT SWETONIC
Mustapha Abu-Zahr, a visiting
instructor in Biology from the
Middle Eastern country of Leb-
anon. expressed his “deep appre-

ciation tor the great eiforts played '

by the Pitt Council for Interna-
tional Visitors” in enabling him to
meet with American families and
to “clear up a lot of misconcep-

tions concerning Lebanon and the
Middle East.”

“I have felt,” continued Abu-
Zahr in an interview last week,

‘ “that many things were not clear

between my country and yours.”

“There is a strong feeling in the
Arab world against the U.S. be-
cause of your ties with the great
colonial powers of Britain and
France. We have the feeling that
these powers have exploited us
and for this reason we despise
their colonial policy."

Solutions Is Unity

“However,” quickly commentecl

Abu-Zahr, “it is not true that if
you are not western then you are
communist, for we do not believe
in Communism as a means of
solving our problems.

“We believe that some kind of
Arab Union is the correct way

“There are two other problems
besides Arab unity currently
troubling the Arab world," con-

“First is the Palestine problem.

cause of the million and a half

“We respect the Jewish people
but are against their government.

is an Israel.”

Civil Engineers

Study Grant

The Pennsylvania Department
has awarded a
$79,373 grant to the University’s
Civil Engineering Department for
research on the durability of pre-
stressed concrete pavement.

The research, to be directed by
R. K. Lightholder and John R.
Smith, professors of civil engineer-
ing will be done for a concrete
slab, ﬁve inches thick, 12 feet
wide, and 530 feet long, construct-
ed -in 1957 by the Jones and
Laughlin Steel Corporation.

The slab is expected to have

much greater strength than con-
ventional concrete pavements and
to be ﬁnancially competitive with
pavements now in existence.

In testing its strength, scien-
tists will simulate the most se-
Vere highway conditions. A
two-axle vehicle with a load of

28,000 pounds per axle will be

inoved over the slab at short
intervals. '0

This motorized load represents
25 per cent greater axle weight
than 1S normally permitted on
Pennsylvania highways.

The test will be conducted in
the spring when effects of ex-
cessive ‘moisture on the slab and
its roadbed will be the greatest.

Previously tested by the Jones
and L3l1ghlin_Steel Corporation,
the slab withstood stationary
loads up to 66,000 pounds before
producing surface cracks. Within
f0U_1‘ days after removing the
weight, the cracks disappeared and
the slab returned to its original
state.

The University project will be
the first extensive repeated-load
test to be conducted on the slab.
One half of the research grant

will comedirectly from Depart-
ment of Highways funds with the
remainder being a portion of the
recent Federal Bureau of Roads
allocation to Pennsylvania.

to thrash the Pitts this

When the Cats return home to

they are expected tovsuccumb to

though Bob Ferguson won’t be

No Contests

All the dopesters figure this is
the way the form sheet must run,
and that the Panthers should be
content to get in practice games
against such worthy opposition be-
fore they face the “contest” sched-
ule. . .

A talk with individual" play-

ers on the team dosen’t indicate
such disastrous thinking, how-
ever. “Sure we realize that
we're up against two great
teams,” one of them said, “but
we’re not going to be so awed
that we’re going to just stand by
andwatch them.”
' Coach Bob Timmons has been
watching his own players closely
of late. "I really like this outfit,”
Timmons says. “l’ve never had a
team with such spirit. They hus-
tle all the time.”

Timmons isn’t speaking with the .

cliche dialogue of every coach in
the business either. Most of them
will tell a reporter the same thing,
but Timmons never said it last
year, and he may have reserved
the observation for a good bunch.

Wrestlers Clash
With Teammates

Intra-squad matches were in
order for the Panther grapplers
last week as Coach Rex Peery
divided the team into ﬁve-man
squads and let the boys wrestle
three periods.

After two days
Dick Martin’s team and Sherm
Moyer’s squad have two wins
against no losses, while the other
two squads headed by Daryl Kel-
vington andylohn Zolikoff are
winless in two tries.

Big upset in the matches was
Sophomore Tom Baily‘s l-O vic-
tory over John Zolikoff. Zolikoff
could have settled for a 0-0 tie as
he was on top of Bailey with little
time remaining. However, John
tried to go for the win and let
Baily escape so that he could take
him down. but such was not the
case as Baily stayed on his feet
until the end of the match.

Leading the way for Moyer’s
team are Freshman Tom Heniff,

Amid all the Homecoming
hoopla it was merely inci-

at the Stadium on Saturday.

That same evening the tanned.
skin members of the losing eleven
were trying to ferret out the one
secret entrance into the Cathedral
to attend the Homecoming Ball,
and shivering in their muddy
tracks.

“This weather is impossible,”
one claimed. “How can these peo-
ple stand this cold?”

Indian Summer

A native passerby informed the
foreigner that “this is our Indian
summer.” The Californian pulled
his overcoat a little higher around
his ears, and said, “I feel like
Frank Nitti (of Untouchable
fame). Rat-a-tat-tat-tat !”

“By the way,” another in-V
quired, “can we get in the
dance for free‘? We’re friends of
Fred Cox.”

shouldn’t hear such words. or the

Greek Week Chairman l

   

Announces New Plans

Bob Slotkin, chairman for this
year's Greek Week celebration,
announced preliminary plans for

the Week- at the Interfraternity.

Council meeting held last Wednes-
day nightlin Schenley Hall.
S10-tkin. commented that two
years ago Glenn Mi1ler’s orchestra
played for the Greek Week dance
and that it would give the system
a great amount of “prestige” if
they w ou 1 d have another big

name band to perform this year. A

“This would be,”. said Slotkin,
a real answer for thos~ who
want to know what we’re doing."

He also told the council that
since the Brothers Four were such
a success last year, he is going to
have another big name singing
group to highlight this years fes-
tivities.

Slotkin thanked the fraternities
for their participation in Home-
coming, emphasizing the fact that
there were “more housefronts this

66

. year than floats last year.”

‘‘This;’’ he contends, “shows that
support has not gone down, in-

 
 

l .

, _
l

«

  

stead it has increased.”

Art Pape, president of IF, also
extended his appreciation to the
Council chairmen for the work
they have done so far this year.
“They are a Tﬁne bunch of men
who are doing their jobs wel1,"
stated Pape.

Distinguished from that which has pirac-
tical application, pure research is ‘ con-
cerned with the discovery of fundamental
knowledge to widen man’s understanding
of himself and the universe.

Ford Motor Company's Scientiﬁc Labora-
tory in Dearborn, Michigan is dedicated
to the pursuit of knowledge in the physical
sciences. On its staff are scientists of
national and international reputation who
conduct independent basic research pro-

grams of an extremely broad nature.

Why does Ford Motor Company support
research which seemingly is unrelated to
the man u/acture of its products?

It is our view, anda pioneering concept
in our industry, that entirely new ap-
proaches to automotive development can
come only from unhampered scientiﬁc
investigation. Deeper understanding of
matter itself. and of the conversion and
storage of energy~aslde from widening
man's primary l<nowledge——may_ have
practical application in ‘tomorrow's vehicle
design.

Thus knowledge wrested from nature by
scientists will be taken by technologists
and applied to serve practical needs and
desires. Another example of Ford’s leader-
ship through scientific research and
engineering.
