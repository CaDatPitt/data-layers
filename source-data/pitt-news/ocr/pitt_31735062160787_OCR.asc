°Herman said that the step was

taken to give the senior women
a feeling of participating in a ﬁnal
event which will climax their
college years. A

She added, “We hope that th
occasion will set high standards‘
of which we can be proud.”
‘The award to the Mortar Board

Woman of the Year will be a spe-
cially made ring of selected gar-
nets of the same type as was given
to the Senior Queen in former
years.

All senior women and’ those
who were graduated this Feb-
ruary will receive a list this
week of all their classmates who“
have the 2.0 QPA required for
the recognition. This is the av-
erage for membership in the
honorary society.

« It is stressed, however, that the
recipient need not be a member
of Mortar Board.

Seniors will vote for one co-
ed whose name appears" on the
list in addition to their own if
they hate the scholastic quali-
ﬁcation. They should return bal-
lots to 1209 Cl. by Wednesday,

_ Apr. 23.

According to the president, the

chapter has compiled the names
of all those who qualify. The list,
however, is not official. , .
Other criteria to be cited in
the letter. are that the candidate
be a woman who has promoted
college loyalty, advanced a spir-
it of service and fellowship

among University’ women, rec-, »

ognized and encouraged leader-"
ship, and stimulated a finer type

college woman. These are the

ideals set forth by the national,
organization.

Nominees will be placed on a
second list and considered by all
members of Mortar Board who
will vote for three women. The
ten with the highest number of
votes will be placed on the filial
selection list. . _

Final "selection committee will
be composed of two members of
the administration, two faculty
members; advisers to Mortar
Board, and three members of
the current chapter who are not
on the list for ﬁnal considera-
tion. ‘ i

The chapter for the coming year
will also be announced on Tap
Day. Women chosen typify those
“who have rendered service with-
out hope of reward, have fostered
leadership without selﬁsh vain-
glory, and have honored learning
without display.” ' ‘

At last, all cotton drip-dry
shirts are a reality ! Van Heusen
has achieved this triumph in
the new Vantage shirt which
is‘ 100% cotton, drip-dries in
a jiffy, and needs no ironing!_
At only $5, it’s the all-around
shirt for college men, and also
has a few special uses which
you might possibly overlook.
You’re'expelled from school.
Since you have no money,
you’re forced to, walk home.
(you live in Lovelyville, 1,357
miles away). The Van Heusen
Vantage shirt is perfect for
this situation. First, you can
wash it in the many brooks
you pass as you trudge along
the open road . . . and, as you
catch a quick wink in a hollow
log, it will drip-dry and be
neat and snappy for the next
‘lap of your trek. Second,
because Vantage is all cotton,
it looks so smart that you
begin to feel well-educated.
People will say, “there goes a
cultured chap.”
You’re water bag on the foot-
ball team. Ideal spot for Van
Heusen Vantage shirts. We

you can wear them heroically

You owe the laundry $342.45.
Let us say you owe the laundry
$342.45 and are ashamed to
show your face there, and even
feel terror when you smell the
disinfectant ﬂoating out of
the Laundromat. A set-up for
Vantage! Since it drip—dries,
and needs no ironing, you need
never enter the laundry again.
And because it’s all cotton,
it’s so elegant—looking, you can
pass the laundry with
equanimity. The owner, seeing
you stroll by in your Vantage,
will say to himself, “No sense
dunning Morgan for that
dough. He’s so rich, he's bound
to pay mesoon.”

In Vantage, you inspire
conﬁdence. In Vantage, you’re
set for every college occasion.

in the telephone business.

We own and operate 1,696 cen
in 30 states.

We manufacture telephones, switches,
relays and other communications equip-
ment, for our own use—and for the 4,400
other “independent” telephone companies

in the United States.

And while — by the yardstick of size — we
cannot claim to be the leader, we find
ample opportunity for leadership in other

ways.

Take the telephone pictured here as an

example. It is our own design.

At first glance, it may look quite a bit like

other modern telephones.

But you will find’ three important

differences.

The surfaces just above the dial on each
side are contoured to guide the mouth-
piece-receiver or “handset” into place
unerringly.

An extra quarter of an inch is addedgto
the tapered mouthpiece and earpiece.

And the cradle whieh,receives the “hand-
set” is lower in front than in the rear.

The result: It is almost impossible for
an “off-the-hook” interruption to service‘
to happen. r

This is, as we said, one example of how
we seek to do whatever we do better than
it has been done before.

And this same ambition guides every
phase’ of our operation, from the develop-
ment of better equipment for telephone
central oﬂices, to the courtesy-training of
the people who represent us in dealing
with our customers.

Woman Of Tﬁe Year A

The decision of Mortar Board to sponsor the honoring
of the outstanding senior woman is the natural outcome of

/

s a chain of events.

iFor years the method of selection of Senior Queen,

predecessor of Mortar Board Woman of the Year, was crit-

icized soundly as covert and undigniﬁed. The ceremony by
which she was honored was obsolete and meaningless.

Finally, the senior women of last year’s class pressed

for abolition of both the ideal and the coronation. When

 they outvoted the ideal, .however, they left a void in their

college year where there should have been a climax. They

(claimed that no one among them was outstanding enough

' to merit recognition. Theywere equal.

5

The leaders of the present class felt this void strongly
until Mortar Board took up the lingering issue and decided
to select the outstanding leader in ‘thesenior class. Thus
the award has reached the proper source, for who better
than these women should be able to recognize the ideals of
higher character, scholastic achievement,“and leadership.

Pitt’s Mortar Board chapter, however is refraining cau-
tiously from expressing the hope that the decision will es-
established a precedent. Its members are afraid to feel that
they may be “inﬂicting” unwanted tradition upon following
chapters. Theirs is an enthusiasm with unnecessary re-

. S€I‘Ve..

/ .

A Presentation of the idea to the group was hindered
until now by the fear that the student body would compare
Mortar Board Woman of the Year unfavorably with Senior

I Queen. As the year progressed, they resolved to withstand

if pdssible criticism for the worthwhile cause.

Another obstacle stood in the way of the ﬁnal decision,
however. The promoters of the idea were met with corn-
plaints that their plan seemed-like a copy of the ODK Man

I of the Year,

It is true that the method of selection resembles the lat-
ter to- an extent, but’ the women have adopted a pattern

_which meets their own situation. ” ‘

A‘ If.the final result is parallel to ODK Man, Mortar Board
can hope, for nothing better. For the selection of the latter is
viewedhwith the dignity and respect proper to the occasion.

Such an outcome would realize the hope of the ‘women

. for an ‘event which “will set high standards of which we

can be proud.”
The Pitt News is fulﬁlling its promise of last Oct. 30

I when its editorial stated that this publication stands ready

to support a positive move to re-establish the honoring of
a senior woman under a different title from that of Senior
Queen., . .
The decision of Mortar Board calls for that support from
all phases of the University family. All should assist in es-

 ’The   ln's, The Outs, And Why

(Edt'tor’s note: This is the last of two articles
on the recent student elections.) I I 

By Murray Chess 4

For theivoter who was not ‘attached to either_

party, or who was attached but wanted to vote a
split ticket in the elections, it was diﬂicult to de-
cide which men, and women, to vote, for. The only
clear choices,he had were for the two spots of
Chief Justice and secretary of I
Men’s Council, for which the’

to slate anyone. . _

This lack of a complete slate
was one of two faults that could
be found with the'UI ticket. It
does not seem sensible that when
there are two parties, one of
them cannot ﬁnd enough good
men to run for office. This prac-
tice is actually as unfair to the
voters. _  I 

One object of a two-party system is to give the
voters more than one candidate from whichto
choose. In failing to do this, the Independents did
not meet their responsibility.

The other_ fault with this slate was the UI’s
choice for vice—president of Council, Bill Kaliden.
We hold nothing against Kaliden as an individual

and we do not doubt his ability as a leader and an —»

executive. We do, however, feel that because he is
an athlete, he should have stayed out of the politi-
cal picture altogether. 4

It has been proven too many times in the past
that athletes, and especially football players, are
not successful oﬁ°ice—holders. They simply do not
have the time to put in on a governmental body.
The most recent example is the case of Tom
Jenkins, a’ football player, who was vice—president
of Student Congress in 1956-57. «

Jenkinsno doubt had the brains and ability for
the job, but could _not put enough time and work

‘into it because of football. We’=hope we will be‘

proven wrong in Kaliden’s case.
Not All for the Best ,. ‘

As for the Allied Collegiate ticket, certain state-
ments were heard a'round election time that this
party did not slate the best men it had. This was
true, but it was more a case of-mbn not being.will-.
ing to run for positions rather than wanting to run
and not being slated. A ' o

A Man With  Country .‘::I ,

Cast-ro'~s Crusade

. «By Millard Amdur . , _
On April 12, twenty-three Columbians who had
just received their medical. degrees from local uni-
versities offered their services to'the Cuban rebels.
They offered them, evenpif their medical services
could not be of use, as soldiers. In Honduras, police
have arrested ' several men for it
gun-running to the rebel forces.
Like stories are .happening
every day in many nations in-1 A
cluding our-, own. Fidel Castro,

by many of the press, is sup-
ported inevitably by those who
get to speak with him,

A good example of just such a
thing is an article which .ap-
peared in the April 14 issue of
Time magazine by Sam Halper,

contributingeditor. He reached Castro’s hideout by

ponyback riding down the Sierra Maestra moun-
tainside. j "

Odds for Fidel

He spoke of the incredible morale of the forces
with barely enough to eat ﬁghting insurmountable
odds. As Castro says, however, “if they (Batista’s
army) had been ﬁghting for an ideal, they could
havebeaten us 30 times. But no man is supposed to
die for $30 a month.” — ' ’

Castro marches with his men, often for long
stretches with nothing to eat or drink in torrid
Cuba. Castro, appears not to worry about losing the
war. “If Batista loses, he loses for good; if I lose,
I will just start over again.”

Palmer says about Castro’s men, “They believe in
him (and hate Batista) fanaticglly; they believe
they are ﬁghting for their country‘s freedom.”

Edward Tomlinson, roving correspondent for a
newspaper chain, has echoed the view of many ob.-
servers in Latin America that the U.S. should stay
out of the dispute.

' His ideas about Castro are far different from
Palmer’s. Tomlinson, who has spent the past 35

— years commuting between the U.S. and Latin Amer-

ica ‘predicted that if the dictator’s regime fails, it

A will not be because of the rebel 1eader,gEide1 Castro. 7

‘to push through an amendment to the Men’s Coun-

cil constitution that would have added thirteen class
and school representatives to the ballot and to the
slates. These positions would have supposedly re-

placed the class ofﬁcer representatives which were

eliminated this year.

»-. But the amendment was wisely thrown out before

it could be voted upon. It is very easily seen how

this mbve, if successful, would have been harmful’

to the Independents. - ,
Now ‘into the election results themselves. This

year of 1958 should be remembered for a long time_

for its election surprises. The total vote itself was
the biggest surprise.,The 2044 total for SGA ballots

ll‘ .

cast was the greatest in the history ofstudent elec-*

ﬂtions. This beat the 1955 total by seven votes. .

Last year only 1314 students voted. This year’:
Men’s Council total was also much higher’ than
l957’s, 1449 compared with last year’s total of 1010.

Engineers D_id‘n'1' Show .—

Prior to the elections, most everyone conceded
the large majority of votes in the‘ Student”Union
and Engineering Hall to the Independents. It was
the Commons Room vote that the Collegiates would
need to win. And that’s exactly how it happened--
with one exception. '

The total vote in the two UI strongholds was too
small. This was especially true in Engineering
where only 147 students bothered to vote. This
small number was deﬁniteiy disheartening to the
hard-ﬁghting Independents who went put of their
way to inform tlie sleeping hill of what was
happening.

‘As a result, we‘un'fortunatel_y must remember to
forget the slide—rule bunch‘ for future elections.

One_last statistic may prove of some interest. The
AC Party needed only 92 more straight-ticket votes
to have won every SGA and MC positions but one.
This one would have been a sophomore SGA post.

Now that we?'have come to the end of this post-

mortem, we feel that it would not be complete with-
out one more thing. So,‘for all the politicians who"
may now be complaining of how they have been

criticized in these two columns or‘ for those who are

grinning and patting themselves on the back fora

plus point, here is a specially prepared scorecard:

(“X”,is for criticisms; “C” is for commendations.)

He called Castro “a little bush-\A<acke1"’ with a
small group of die—hard rebels who exist only.be-
cause seeking them .“is like looking for a needle in
a haystack.

Tomlinson asserts that one sign of trouble in the
Batista government is the high school ‘student
strikes which could swing the labor element for-
merly strongly pro—Batista away from him.
Chains About -l'o Break ' _

The reporter also believes that Bat-ista’s refusal
to go along with the Catholic’ Church leaders in
their compromise recommendation is a sign of im-
pending doom for the dictator. _ '

Castro plans “to ‘fight to the bitter end” in his

efforts to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. Although the p (K

Roman Catholic Church has played an active roll

in trying to quell a bloody rebellion, Castro rejected A

the mediation efforts and called on the nation to
“Be alert and tense . . . because your chains_ are

‘ about to break.” ‘ .
He accused the ‘government of using the church-

men to reach its own ends. The government in turn
accused him of consorting with the communists
which he denies vehemently. \ ‘

Castro claims that “nothing or no one can halt
us.” The extraordinary powefs granted Batista by
his Congress makes it seem extremely unlikely that
Batista will be defeated in the near future.
Newspaper Seizure Scored

The. fighting as of Sunday appeared to have
reached thecentral sector of the country.’ Havana
is quiet and under almost martial law.

Heavy fighting is now reported at Sagua La ,
Grande and Santa Clara,’ capital of Las Villas Prov- ’

ince, and skirmishes occur daily in Sierra Maestras
near Castro’s hideout. Government spokesman claim
that the a1l—out attack has ﬁzzled out, yet ﬁghting
is still widespread. I

The general strike, which Castro promised, never
materialized. The Cuban government’s use of troops

to seize a Havana daily newspaper’s plant was de-_

nounced by the Inter-American Press Association.
The government had used the plant to print false
accounts of the uprising. IAPA president, John

O’Rourke, also editor of the Washington Daily 

News, called the action“ ]o~rutal‘and degndding.”

The Panther Volleyball team is the-only College group
entered in the eight-team AAU Senior Volleyball Tourna-
ment which will be held Saturday at the Field House.

Sponsored by the Allegheny Mountain Association of the
Amateur Athletic Union, the tournament will feature YMCA

teams representing‘ Oil City,
Pittsburgh along with three inde-0
pendent teams from-Monessen and
Monaca.

Defending champion in the
double elimination tourney is
the Monessen Turners, but the
roll of the, tournament favorite
this year goes to the strong St.
Joseph team of Monaca. .

St. Joseph won the Cherry’ Blos-
som Tournament in Washington,
D.CA., last weekend, and they are
now ranked sixth among the na-
tion’s top-flight volleyball teams.

The Panthers, in addition to
wanting to‘ make a sucessful ap-

develop a well rounded team at-
tack as they prepare for the Na-

be held next month at Scranton.

take part in the spring football
drills, the Panther’s efforts may be

' -F or Initial Win

_r At Miami, Ohio
' By JOHN sU’nLivAN' I

Revenge for last Saturday’s
dismal showing against Navy
will be the theme of the Pan-
ther-Miami of Ohio track

- meet Friday afternoon when

Carl Olsen’s depthless run-

ners take to the Stadium cinder-
paths.

“The one thing which was evi-
dent in our showing last week,”
‘said Coach Olsen, “was our lack
of depth. We showed good strength
in some spots, but we just didn’t
have a well balanced attack.”
M Aiquick check of_ the records
from Saturday’s meet proved Ol-
sen_ right as only ﬁve men, Jim
Donaugh, Rege Goggin, Ron Rush,

.4‘-“

Paul Thrash, and Mell Barnwell, .

accounted for over two-thirds of
the locals 64 points.

Strong In Track Events

Olsen indicated that the Miami
meet on Friday will probably
shape up as a “nip and tuck af-
fair.” Individual results this week
should follow closely those from
last «week’s surprising two point
loss to Navy. . -

“We will pick up points in
the 100, 220, and 440 yard '
dashes,” said Olsen. “And we
should do well in the mile run

S and several of the ﬁeld events.”

. getters last Saturday will face stiﬁ

competition on Friday, and this

may hamper the team’s chances
of winning.

Goggin, Thrash Improve

Ron Rush, winner of both the
mile and two mile runs last week,

will face strong opposition from ,

Miarni’s ﬁne distance ace, Dave
Ron Rieke, ‘who
won both the high jump and the
high hurdles in the Miami-BOWL
ing Green meet recently, should al-
so prove troublesome to the Pan-
thers.

Rege lGoggin, steady high
jumper and surprise winner in
the broad jump last Saturday,
and co-captain Paul Thrash," a
reliable hurdler, should give a
good account of themselves.

The thinclads’ chances of win-
ning on Friday depend on the
:showing of pole vaulter Max
Kumer and distance men Vince
Timon: John Christoﬂ’, and Dale
Fauser. Kumer, who has better-
ed 12’ 6" in practice this year,
failed to score on Saturday, and

' Timon, Christoff, and Fauser fail-
ed to live up to past performances.

TENNIS

Women students interested in
tennis are invited to try out for
the Women’s Tennis Team to-
morrow. Students should report
to the Fifth Avenue Entrance at
2 p.m. with their equipment. A
university bus will transport
those interested to and from
Wildwood. Interested girls who
do not have available equip-
ment should check at 2928 C1.

ind move is to lift the weight
