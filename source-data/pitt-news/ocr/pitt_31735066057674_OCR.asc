probe

By Matt Serlin
Managing Editor

University authorities
are investigating a vul-
gar, threatening and
harassing E-mail mes-
sage sent to a Pitt stu-
dent Monday evening.

‘‘I was in shock,” said

Bill Gray, business
manager of the Bisexual
Gay and Lesbian

Alliance, who received
the message.

The author of the let-
ter wrote that he was on
another person’s
account who did not
know about the mes-
sage.

“You don’t know me.
I know that my user
name says kahstl3, but
that is not me,” the let-
ter stated.

Pitt student Kimberly
Heckman, whose
account was used to
send the message, said
she knows nothing
about the incident.

“I have no idea about
it,” Heckman said after
being informed of the
use of her account to
send the message.

According to Rick
Boyd, Pitt’s public safe-
ty director, the depart-
ment is investigating the
incident as possible ter-
roristic threats, harass-
ment by communication
or hate crimes.

The letter contained
vulgar language as well

City police, BLCE investigate death

By Sani Gresock
Graphics Asst.

Following the alcohol-relat-
ed death of a Pitt student last
week, city police and the state
Bureau of Liquor Control
Enforcement have initiated
investigations into the incident.

Atif Bhatti, a 21-year-old
Pitt senior, died Friday mom-
ing, two days after drinking
beer and 16 shots of whiskey

in less than an hour at
Mitchell’s Tavern in North
Oakland. A coroner’s office
spokesperson said the cause of
death was chronic alcohol
overdose, pending further
investigation.

Cpl. Kenneth Jones, district
office commander at the
Pennsylvania Bureau of Liquor
Control Enforcement, said the
BLCE has begun an investiga-
tion to determine if Mitchell’s

violated any state liquor laws.

“[Bartenders] are not permit-
ted to serve someone who is
visibly intoxicated,” Jones
said.

Jones said the fact that Bhatti
began drinking in Mitchell’s at
11:30 on the night before he
actually turned 21 is deemed
irrelevant in court, even though
he was technically underage.

Low turnout cancels NSA Career Day

By Tamara A. Goodman
For the Pitt News -

Out of 175 hospitals in
over 15 states, only five said
they could be present at the
Nursing Student
Association’s (NSA) Career
Day, which was scheduled to
be Dec. 5.

“It’s a shame that it has to
be cancelled, because it gives
students the opportunity to
network and make connec-
tions,” said Melissa
DeCicco, president of NSA.

“Due to health-care reform,
a lot of hospitals have had to
cut down on costs,- which
results in less job opportuni-

ties, said Ed Nosky, vice
president of NSA.

However, NSA did hold a
“job hunt” on Nov. 14. It
included workshops on how

petitive market. Taking the

Pastor speaks about ''Black Genocic|e'.'

By -Eric Smith
For The Pitt News

Self-proclaimed radical
speaker, Pastor Johnny
Hunter, spoke to a crowd of
nearly 100 students Monday
night in the union.

Hunter is the associate
pastor of the National
Community Church in
Washington, D. C., and
recipient of the 1990 Martin

Luther King Leadership
Award.

Billed on posters as the
“Truth ofBlack Genocide,”
the pastor spoke, yelled and
sang about his stand against
abortion and its affects on
African Americans.

‘‘Blacks are facing prob-
lems from the womb to the
tomb,” said Hunter.

He pointed out statistics
showing that while blacks
make up 12 percent of the

population, they account for
30 percent of all abortions.
He did not give the source
of the numbers.

Hunter spoke of the high
rate of incarceration for
young black males and the
prevalence of drugs in their
community. He acknowl-
edged the need to address
these problems but said he
felt the attention given to
them masked a more “insidi-
ous threat.”

“Abortion tackles us at the
root.-‘Drugs get us above the
root. If you survive that,
they have jail. More blacks
are being killed legally by
abortion than the KKK ever
lynched,” he said.

Alternating between
speaking softly and than
abruptly yelling to empha-
size a point, he was accom-
panied by “amen” and “right
on” from the crowd.

BEIJING — China will ban
sex-screening of fetuses and
will forbid couples carrying
serious genetic diseases to
have children under a new
family law to take effect in
January, officials said today.

Sex-screening, using ultra-
sound machines, has become
popular in China because of
the tradition of preferring
sons to daughters. Some par-
ents —— allowed only one
child — choose abortion
when they find out that the
wife is carrying a girl. This
has led to a rising imbalance
in the ratio of men to women
in China.

The law decrees that sex
identification of a fetus by
technical means is strictly for-
bidden, except when needed
on medical grounds. Doctors

, who perform such tests,

which are not difficult, could
lose their license under the
law. —— The New York Times

PARIS — Hundreds of pas-

will take a share of the heavy

minutes to go from Paris to
London through the $16 bil-
lion tunnel, the world’s

MYTH OF THE MONTH:
“Date rape will never hap-

There appears to be a
misconcep-
tion that only

raped.

U n f o rt-
unately, this
misconcep-

serves as a kind of false
sense of security against
the knowledge that anyone
can be victimized.

In my interactions with

sense that they mistakenly

believe date/acquaintance
rape will not/cannot hap-

believe that they are
“immune” to the power of
this phenomenon.
Ironically, the numbers
indicate that freshman and
sophomore women are
more likely to be raped
than upper

In order to
dispel this

He‘ was in constant
motion, never standing
behind the podium for
longer than a sentence,
and at one point his
wife, Patricia, sang a
tune written by Hunter
while he played the piano.
Unable to find an overhead
projector, his adolescent
sons, David and Johnny,
walked through the crowd
displaying newspaper and
magazine articles that
agreed with his perspective.

Hunter laid much of the
blame for the far—reaching
impact of abortion on
the media. He claimed
that it rarely covers African
American protestors at
clinics, citing a rally where
cameras were turned off as
they panned the African-
American crowd and
switched back on when the
crowd was white.

Most of his statements
regarding a societal
conspiracy to promote
abortion among African
Americans were non-spe-

spoke of its founder

Margaret Sander and her
connections at the turn of
the century with different
eugenics movements."
He spoke of her connec-
tions to Hitler and interest
in the Nazi movement
prior to the war. He cited
Sander’s book, “Pivot of

“blatantly racist” and pro-
moted birth control for
races and ethnic mixes she
deemed less than accept-

Hunter pointed to the fact
that PPFA clinics are locat-

Delaware that provides

“We thought we would

said.

She hedged questions
about the PPFA founder,
stressing the age of the

insightful, perceptive and
confident young woman.

(For obvious reasons, she
will remain anonymous.)

I was a sophomore. I had
been on Pitt’s main campus a
whole year and a semester. I
knew the area. I knew where
to go, where not to go, what

was and was not safe. I had a.

close circle of friendswho
looked out for one another.

W6 I1CVCI' let OIIC another g0’

out late at night alone or dur-
ing the day for that matter.
We were just like that, you
know, close. We trusted each
other totally. That’s why
when they introduced me to
him I thought nothing of it.
They liked him; trusted him;
more than that they thought
the world of him. My
boyfriend also knew and
liked him. He was popular.
Popular to everyone but me,
that is. I kept getting this
funny vibe off of him. It was
weird. There was just some-
thing about him that I did not
like. No, it was stronger than
that. It was a terribly uncom-

fortable feeling. Anyway,
they all trusted him so I
buried my feelings and trust-
ed him, too. I never believed I
could be raped. Until that
Easter weekend morning
when he came to my room. I
let him in and he raped me.
Who could I tell? What do I
do? What do I say? How?
Why?

That was two and a half
years ago. I didn’t get help. I
didn’t press charges. At the
time, I did not believe I could
handle that. I chose not to
associate any longer with the
people I believed were my
“friends.” They were more
concerned about fitting in
than true friendship. I’m
stronger now and more aware
of how to prevent this from
happening to myself again or
to others. I have a great life
and new friends. I have
learned to trust myself instead
of others. With every talk I
give or every word I write on
the subject, and every day
that I live, I feel stronger. I
am no longer a victim; I am a
survivor.

Hunter’s message was full
of optimism for the future.
He denounced the term
“Generation X,” saying he
preferred the term “Phoenix
generation” instead. He said
the group sitting in front of
him had overcome so much
simply to be enrolled in a
university.

Hunter encouraged the
students to challenge his
words and look up the facts
for themselves, and he sug-
gested marriage and
monogamy as alternatives
to birth control and a return
to responsibility on the part
of fathers.

Hunter’s talk was
sponsored by the
Organization of Minority
and Female Conservatives,
Pre-med Organization for

In closing, Hunter asked

Gray said he now fears for

Prior to receiving the letter,
Gray had written several let-

homosexuality.

“I didn’t think by writing
that I would receive that

He said cases such as this
have been thrown out by
Pennsylvania courts since the
persons in question were on
the eve of their 21st birthday.
“The courts don’t consider it a
violation,” Jones said. “We do,
but they don’t.”

Jones said the investigation
into the incident should take
several days.

“We’re going to work as
hard as we can and as fast as
we can,” Jones said.

The university has turned the
investigation over to city
police detectives and the
BLCE. Pitt’s public safety
department is not currently
involved in the investigation,
according to Pitt Director of
Public Safety Rick Boyd.

Campus police assisted in
the response to the call when
Bhatti was found unconscious
Wednesday morning, Boyd
said.

“The investigation has since

been turned over to the City of _

Pittsburgh [Police] and the
BLCE,” he said. “At this point
in time, it’s out of our jurisdic-
tion.” —

Bhatti consumed 16 shots of
whiskey and an undetermined
amount of beer last Tuesday
night and early Wednesday
morning while celebrating his
21st birthday. He died Friday
morning at Presbyterian
University Hospital after his
parents made the decision to
remove him from a life-sup-
port system.

I996 already?

It has begun — the 1996 presidential campaign that is. Not sur-

_ prisingly, after the overwhelming gains by the Republican party in

last week’s election, Republicans have been openly moving
toward the campaign trail. In the last week soon-to-be Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole, Texas Senator Phil Gramm and
Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter have all visited Iowa, the site
of the first presidential caucuses. Specter also soon plans to visit
New Hampshire, the site of the first primary. Gramm has openly
declared his candidacy, and Specter has declared his intentions to
find out if he has a chance at winning the nomination (i.e. he is
basically a candidate). -

The early start for Republicans is indicative of how vulnerable
they feel President Clinton is. But it will be a long road before a
Republican candidate emerges from the pack to directly challenge
Clinton. Besides Gramm, Dole and Specter, major players for the
Republican nomination include former Vice President Dan
Quayle, California Governor Pete Wilson, former Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp and an entire list of less likely but possible
candidates, including the retired Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman,
Colin’ Powell.

What effect will this have on the Republican party? It could
have a very large one. Specter has already announced that he
intends to run against the religious right. Specter is a moderate
Republican, and such Republicans have been overshadowed late-
ly asthe far right and the religious right have gained power and,
some feel, control of the party. It is one thing for moderates and
far—right ideologues to get along when the Democrats are in con-
trol of Congress, but now that the Republicans are in control the

- cracks may begin to show.

One potential fofitﬁhe fracturing of the party, besides the fact that
the election could be centered around soon-to-be Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich’s brain child, the Contract with America.
The Contract has been derided by the Democrats and the media,
including The Pitt News, for its contradictory attempts to simulta-
neously cut taxes, increase military spending and balance the bud-

’ get. Whether ‘Gingrich will be able to muster the votes of moder-

ate Republicans needed to pass the bill remains to be seen.

. However, even if it does pass the House, it is almost certain to go

nowhere in the Senate and would certainly receive a presidential
veto. This could create further animosity within the party, which
could spill over to the primary campaigns.

The Republicans have been given their chance to demonstrate
their leadership to the country, but there are hard choices ahead of
them. They must decide whether they wish to continue their poli-
cies of obstructionism, like the Contract, or whether they want to
work with the Democrats for bipartisan progress. Furthermore,
the party as a whole and individual members must decide on their
course of action for the 1996 presidential election. A far—right
candidate will have a difficult time defeating Clinton in ‘96, but
the religious right will be hesitant to give up its new-found power.
Senator Specter’s early willingness to run against the religious
right portends the possibilities of great schisms to come.

BAS and Hillel

In response to your
November 15 article
“Speaker, SGB help relieve
racial tensions,” I feel that
several points of clarification
must be made. First of all the
opening excerpt which
states, “tensions between
Pitt-’s Black Action Society
and Hillel have begun to dis-
sipate” implies that there has
been tension felt by both
organizations towards one
another. This is not the case.

The African American/Jewish
tension at the University of
Pittsburgh has been to my
knowledge felt solely by
Jewish students and faculty
who are active in Hillel, and
have attempted to initiate
activities with the Black
Action Society, without suc-
cess. This does not mean that
the Black Action Society is
unwilling to work with Hillel
or any other student organi-
zation. It simply means that
there are other issues which
understandably take prece-
dence on its agenda, hence
this tension is not evident to
them.

Additionally, the article
states that I organized the
student leader luncheon
which took place on
November 14. While I did
assist with the coordination
of this event, there are sever-
al members of the Hillel
Foundation and the Jewish
Community Relations
Council who worked
extremely hard and their
efforts are certainly laudable.

Finally and most impor-
tantly the article states that
“the primary purpose of the
discussion was to clear the
air between BAS and Hillel
....” Once again this implies
that there were definitive
problems between these
organizations which paints a

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

negative picture of both’BAS
and Hillel. The primary pur-
pose of the luncheon was to
meet Jeannine Amber who is
a speaker with a vested inter-

‘est in improving relations for

all different groups of peo-
ple. In doing so, a dialogue
could be established by any
interested parties — not two
specific organizations. In
conclusion, it should be
noted that both the lecture
and the luncheon brought
together various student
organizations for the purpose
of strengthening relations.
Such events are unprecedent-
ed and I was pleased just to
play a small role in their
coordination.

Frcil parties

I’m writing this  in
response to the article writ-
ten about fraternities in
Monday’s “Letters to the
Editor.” While I agree that
fraternities have changed
over the years, what disturbs
me is what Mr. Kaizar says
about women at frat parties.
The thought that obviously
or not, “women are set up so
that they cannot avoid hav-
ing sex” is completely
absurd! I have been onthis
campus for four years and I
have been to my share of frat
parties. At these parties I
have consumed alcohol and I
assure you Mr. Kaizar, l have
never had a problem avoid-
ing sex. And I am sick to
death of women being por-
trayed as weak, mindless
creatures.

Women are not stupid.
From the moment we arrive
at school, we are made aware
of the statistics of rape and

sexual assault on campus.
We also are aware of the
effects of alcohol in relation
to altering decision-making
processes. And like most
people, we learn our toler-
ances. Whether at frat par-
ties, bars or apartment par-
ties, we decide whether or
not to drink to excess. No
one pours the alcohol down
our throats, and I think we
are a little old to blame
drinking on peer pressure.
Because we have this choice,
we are responsible for our
actions.

There is a problem with
some men taking advantage
of girls in drunken states.
But to say that women can’t
avoid this or that this prob-
lem is exclusive to fraterni-
ties isboth ridiculous and
absolutely false. If women
want to avoid having sex,
especially sex they will
regret (or forget) in the
morning, then they can make
intelligent choices at night.
They don’t have to get drunk
out of their minds. They
don’t have to go off some-
where with a guy and do
things that in a sober state
they wouldn’t do. (Now
before anyone gets on their
soap box, I am not talking
about rape or any forced sex-
ual assault. I’m taking about

sexual acts of consenting ..

adults.) It’s time we stop
blaming things like alcohol
availability and certain orga-
nizations and start blaming
individuals who use poor
judgement.
given choices, and we are
ALL accountable for the
actions we take — men and
women. So please stop act-
ing as though women are
helpless to their surround-
ings. That simply is not true.

The sound of grinding teeth.

That whole take a shower,

routine.

However, the gold medal, far
and away, goes to the incessant
whining of a college football
fan whose team has been
slighted in the polls.

Nobody within a 3000-mile
radius of Morgantown could

i dispute that fact after experi-

encing the closing weeks of
last season.

After WVU upset Miami at
Mountaineer Field late last sea-
son, every radio talk show in
West Virginia was abuzz with
talk of national championship.

However, when the polls
came out, with the
Mountaineers receiving less
adoration than the faithful
deemed necessary, it all began.
That unmistakable, ear—split-
ting noise could be heard ring-
ing from every comer of the
state.

WAAAAAAAAAH! ! !!

The Mounties rode this tidal
wave of misguided sympathy
into a Sugar Bowl encounter
with Florida, where the Gators
dried those tears with a good
fist in the face.

Now, the ridiculous rating
system that is Division I-A
football appears to have creat-
ed another symphony for the
slighted.

The epicenter for this unnat-
ural disaster lies in State
College, Pa., where the Nittany
Lions are undefeated, unstop-
pable and second-best.

For the second week in a
row, the pollsters have placed
Penn State behind Nebraska in
both the AP and Coaches polls
— this after Penn State pulled
off the year’s greatest come-
from-behind victory while the
Huskers struggled against a
winless team. Uh-oh.

WAAAAAAAAAH! ! ! !

Don’t expect it to get any
better very soon. Essentially,
the only thing the Lions can do
to overtake Nebraska in the
polls before New Year’s Day is
to play out—of—control maniac
football, win the rest of their
games convincingly, and
maybe hope Nebraska loses
along the line.

Pitt edges Marathon Oil i 0

By Jack Becker
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt coach Ralph Willard
never saw a three-point shot
he didn’t, like — at least last
night he didn’t.

The transition of Pitt bas-
ketball from a bang-it-down-
in-the—blocks power team to a
free-flowing perimeter three-
point shooting came in a rash
of outside jumpers as Pitt beat

Marathon

in over-
time last
night at
Fitzgerald
F i e l d
House.

With nearly as many players
dressed in street clothes as in
warm-ups, Pitt buried 17 of
33 three-point shots, includ-
ing one by Sotiris Aggelou

that tied the score with a sec-

ond left in regulation, and had
six players score in double
figures to escape defeat in
exhibition play.

“I went into the game think-
ing I would have to use one of
the coaches to sub,” Willard
said.

Close. Actually, a team
manager, Mike Wernicki, suit-
ed up and played one minute
in the first half. The Panthers
are so depleted by injuries
that only eight players,
including Wernicki and walk-
on Charles Thompson,
dressed for the game. Chris
Gant, Chad Varga and walk-
on Mahdi Spruill all sat out
with injuries.

Pitt almost lost another live
body when Garrick Thomas

utes in the first half with a
sprained ankle. Thomas came
back to score 17 points on six
of seven (five of six on three-
pointers) shooting from the
field.

Chipping in on the three-
point barrage was Aggelou
(three of six on three-pointers
for 15 points), Jason Maile
(five of seven for 17 points)
and Andre Alridge ( four of
eight for 13 points).

Alridge, who replaced the
injured Jerry McCullough as
the starting point guard, hand-
ed out 10 assists and nailed a
crucial three with 13 seconds

left in regulation that put Pitt
in position to tie on Aggelou’s
three.

Alridge was the hero in
overtime as well. With the
score tied at 92-92, Alridge
was fouled by Marathon’s
Todd May with five ticks

remaining. Alridge sank the’

second of two foul shots to
give Pitt its final lead.
Marathon’s Fred Cofield was
unable to get a shot off after

Support Service teaches athletes to

By Erica Glasspool
Staff Writer

At one end of the room a
guy wearing earphones raps
out loud as he types a paper.
Behind him, a guy and girl are
arguing whether or not a girl
looks like a swimmer or a ten-
nis player. At the table next to
them, a group of people loudly
discuss an English assignment.

In walks Christopher
Stevens.

Stevens, a sophomore
wrestler, quietly sits down and
opens his notebook. He poises
his pencil, takes a deep breath
and stops. He just sits there.
Looking and listening to the
anthropology study group also
at the table.

After a few minutes, Cherise
Pollard, a second-year English
student working on her doctor-
ate and a tutor, calls Stevens
over to join her table.

Since last week, Stevens has
been showing up at Pitt’s
Student Athletic Support
Service (SASS) everyday due
to falling grades.

“I’m not doing good acade-
mically,” said Stevens.

“Well,” corrects Pollard.

“But now I can actually
write a paper longer than a
page,” replies Stevens.

The SASS is a program
designed to help student-ath-
letes not only to get better
grades but also to learn how to
balance their time between
academics and sports.

Getting involved in career
exploration, developing study
skills and conducting pre-
advising sessions are some
other things the program also
focuses on.

“We can encourage [stu-
dents] to come up, but once
they’re here they must want to
actually do something,” said
Dr. Ron Brown, Director of
Student Athletic Support
Services.

The graduate rate three years
ago for Pitt’s student-athletic
population was 75 percent.
The non-graduating 25 percent
was due either to an opportuni-
ty on a higher level or to ath-
letes transferring schools.

More impressively, Pitt has

five sports teams recognized
nationally for academics, as
well as several students select-
ed All Big East and one select-
ed academically All-
American.

“We help our student-ath-
letes stay on track towards
their degree. Our focus is get-
ting them graduated in four
years,” said Brown.

Senior Jimmy Morrison is
on Pitt’s baseball team and has
been going to SASS since his
freshman year.

Due to his busy schedule,
getting to the Learning Skills
Center during hours can be
difficult. Although the NCAA
rules state that athletes can’t
be involved in their sports
more than 20 hours a week,
this does not take into consid-
eration traveling, which may
force some students to miss
classes.

“We are here for an educa-
tion. You must love [the sport],
because sometimes it can be
more of a demand than a
source of relief.” said
Morrison.

Although Morrison’s life-

ets three
etters ot
intent

The Pitt basketball team
has received three signed let-
ters of intent from the four
recruits that gave the
Panthers an oral commit-
ment.

Since the early signing
period for high school
recruits began on Nov. 9, Pitt
has collected signed letters of
intent from 6-foot-3-inch
guard Vonteego Cummings
from Thomson, Ga.; 6-8 for-
ward lsaac Hawkins from
Baton Rouge, La. and 6-6
forward Michael Gill from
Washington, D.C.

The fourth recruit, 6-8 for-
ward Andre Howard from
Philadelphia, Pa., has yet to
send Pitt the signed letter of
intent that binds a recruit to a
commitment. Howard chose
to commit to the Panthers last
week.

The rankings on the early
signing period recruiting
classes have started to pour
in with Pitt earning high
marks. ESPN ranked the
Panthers as the fourth recruit-
ingclass in the country. USA
Today had Pitt second.

“Obviously we’re excited
about the class, but right now
that’s over and done with.
We’re pleased, but we’ve got
to concentrate on this year,”
coach Ralph Willard said.

long dream is to be a profes-
sional baseball player, he is
attending Pitt for pre—med
exercise science.

“You have to take school
seriously and keep your grades
up. If I didn’t, when I apply to
med-school they’ll laugh at
my application,” Morrison
added.

Tutor Mark Kruszczynski
holds a weekly anthropology
study group. As regulars Eric
Kasperowicz, a freshman foot-
ball player, and Jo Jo Guzman,
a sophomore basketball player,
begin to crowd around the
table, Kruszczynski asks if
anyone else wants to come and
play with them.

“Learning is hearing, seeing
and physical activity — just
like practice,” said
Kruszczynski.

“Unlike O.J. Simpson’s for-
mal trial, in which his crime
happened five months ago and
he still hasn’t gone to trial, the
BaMut_i system is very infor-
mal,” said Kruszczynski.

“They may discuss a crime
for days, butthey get started

on the process right away.”

Kasperowicz starts to study
the back of his notebook until
Kruszczynski brings him to
attention by asking him to
answer a question Guzman
has.

Kasperowicz rattles off the
answer and is ready for the
next test, but Guzman is hav-
ing trouble. She takes up
Kruszczynski’s suggestion and
types out the deﬁnitions onto a
computer.

Students at the SASS all
seem to know and support
each other. The informal set-
ting is a perfect arena for
diverse and obscure studying
techniques.

Over the last three years
SASS has gone from receiving
25 students a day to 120 and
has lost only five athletes due
to grades.

“This program is so effective
that it is being used as a model
nationally,” said Brown.

“We have become the stan-
dard.”

The SASS has an orientation
with all of the teams at the
beginning of the year.
Freshmen are then brought
back for a separate meeting
where their entire academic
life is laid out in front of them.

“Sports are much more
demanding in college than in
high school. We try to help
bridge the gap between high
school and college and make
[freshmen] more indepen-
dent,” said Jan McMannis, an
Academic Counselor.

The program acts as a liai-
son between the athletes,
coaches and professors. It’s a
big networking system that
lets the coaches know if a stu-
dent is in danger of falling
below the NCAA grade point
guideline of 2.0, while the pro-

‘ fessors let the tutors know

where the athlete is lacking.
“On the average, most pro-
fessors are cooperative and
interested. They really care.
But some professors have a
bad view of athletes in gener-

the Huskers, they will still have
to make minced meat of their —
Rose Bowl opponent in order
to convince the voters that they
deserve a national title. This
will be a problem, considering
the two most probable oppo-
nents for Penn State in
Pasadena are Oregon and USC
— not exactly the most respect-
ed powerhouses in the nation.
Meanwhile, teams like
Alabama and Miami are still in
the championship hunt, and
will surely have much more
appetizing bowl games.
These signs point to an

extremely un-Happy Valley for

loud nightmare for the rest of

In the end, this is just one
more indication that the current
system of deciding a national
champion is ridiculous. Forget
the purist’s viewpoint. Division
I-A football is the only colle-
giate sport not decided on the
field, and it needs a playoff sys-
tem — if for no other reason,
then for God’s sake, just to end
the torture for the rest of us.

Marathon sported five play-
ers that were at least 6-feet-8-
inches or taller.

Four of the five scored in
double figures, including
Robert Conlisk, who scored

19 points and grabbed eight 5

rebounds, and Jim
Shikenjanski, who had 16 and
seven. Marathon Oil was led
by 5-11 Joey Vickery’s 22

points.
However, Pitt center Jaime
Peterson countered

Marathon’s inside strength by
leading the Panthers in points

“It is incomprehensible to
play this style of play and
play this many minutes,”
Willard said.

Four Pitt starters logged at
least 38 minutes of playing
time, and Alridge led the
Panthers by playing all but
one minute.

“We just pushed it,”
Peterson said. “Today there
was only eight of us, so it was
kinda hard. In the locker
room, [Willard] said by
January we’ll be in really
good shape.”

Willard was pleased with
his players performances
under the injury circum-
stances and the fact that the
team is still learning an entire-
ly new philosophy.

“At no point in the game did
they die,” Willard said.
“When they got down at the
end of the game, they found a
way to come back and win.

“Guys really had to dig

al,” said Pam Smith, acade-
mics counselor.

Twice a year status reports
are sent to the coaches for
each athlete along with recom-
mendations on how to
improve their academic per-
forrnance.

These help to identify at risk
students with a Q.P.A. of 2.2
or lower.

Although athletes are not
required to go to the SASS.
some coaches recommend it.
If an athlete is having prob-
lems, some coaches have play-
ers sign in and out when they
go up to make sure they are
getting the help they need.

“We want our players to do
much better than the NCAA
minimum Q.P.A. Our teams
average Q.P.A. of 2.7 is direct-
ly attributed to support ser-
vices,” said Mark Jackson,
coach of Pitt’s baseball team.
