‘A blessing in a crisis’

After week of negotiations, late—night phone calls, Haitian orphans arrive in Pittsburgh

Liz Navratil

For dozens of American families, the
earthquake that killed an estimated
200,000 people last week brought
stressﬁrst.

And then, bittersweethappiness.

Fiﬁy—three Haitian orphans arrived
in Piusburgh late yesterday morning,
following days of worry, late-night

“Is it a blessing in the middle of a
crisis?Yes, it is,” she said. i

The arrival of tlie Haitian orphans
in Pittsburgh marks the end of a week

overcome with both panic and political
activism and the beginning of a larger,
national effort to bring aid to Haitian
orphans.

Like many movements, the one to
bringasmanyas 900 Haitianorphans

to the United States began with indi-

vidual families, those like Heaton’s.
Heaton and her husband, Scott, de-
cided before they were married that
they wanted to adopt children. They
adopted their ﬁrst, Nathaniel, who’s
now2o years old. Theirsecond, 17-year-

Together, the four decided years
ago that they wanted to adopt more
children. One of the family members
“came home with statistics from Haiti,
and it just staggering the number
of children that die of malnutIit1'on,”
Kristin said.

So three years ago, they began the
lengthy process of tryingto adopt Bet-
tania, now 7. Shortly after, they began
trying to adopt Dietmette, now 2.

Every three months, Kristin would
travel to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to take
the girls out of their orphanage for 10
days so they could bond with one an-

alized he should run, it was

too late. The Cathedral lawn
swarmed with G—2O security forces,
and Martin, who said he had been
out observing the protests snaking
through Oakland, was arrested on
charges of failure to disperse as well
as disorderly conduct. '

At his preliminary hearing four
weeks later, the Allegheny County
legal system presented Martin
with a choice: Fight the charges in
court, pay a $300 ﬁne or complete
50 hours of community service be-
fore the end ofjanuary. It was an
easy decision for the senior clas-
sics major. A

“I didn’t want a court battle
hanging over my head,” Martin
said. “And I deﬁnitely didn’t want
to pay. I took the 50 hours because
I wanted to forget that the G-20
ever happened.”

_ For Martin and about 90 others,
events surrounding the tumultuous

late-September Summitwill ﬁnally 
come to a close today. At another

court hearing —— on Jan. 20th for
some-and Jan. 22nd for others -
the students must provide proof
that they completed 50 hours of
community service. If they do so,

their charges will be.dropped, said _ .

Jemison looked at the stars. She

Reaching for the stars

Mae Jemison, the first African American woman in space, tells Pitt students about M artinLuther King and achieving dreams

live her dream at “Dr. King’s Legacy: A
Call to Action.”

She spoke infront of an auditorium
of students and families at the event
organized by the Black Action Society
and the National Society of Black En-

gtneers.
She told students what it took to

' become the ﬁrst African-American

woman in space — as Well as a lesson
her audience could take ﬁ'orn it.
‘Time, possibilities andresponsibil—
ity,” she said.
Very simply, she said, we have time.
There are 86,400 seconds in a day.

Thattimeisﬁlledwithpossibilities,
and we are responsible to take those
possibilities and make of them some-
thing positive, she said.

“Ifyou wait for tomorrow, tomor-
row comes,” Jemison said. “If you
don’t wait for tomorrow, tomorrow
comes.” A

Sossena Wood, president of the
National Society for Black Engineers,
saidJemison’s talkwas partofatwo-day
programofservice andaction. Monday,
Martin Luther Kinglr. Day, was the day
of service.

.“\/Vecalleditadayor1,notadayoff,”

she said. '

Wood said Kingbelievedinservice,
paraphrasing him: “LN”/erybody canbe
great, but everybody can serve,” she
said. 0

Keeping this ideal in mind, Wood,
Black Action Society members and
members of the National Society for
Black Engineers organized events
and service projects for the holiday,
including sorting books at the Carn-
egie Library on the West End, hosting

and helpingjumpstart, a tutoring or-
ganization.

That was the service part. _Iahma—
iah Lewis, president of Black Action
Society, said]emison’s talk was the ac-
tion part.

“We need to celebrate and sup-
port the heroes for Aﬁican—American
people, and she is one ofthose heroes,”
she said. “We justwantedto bringaleg-
end to campus so that she can inspire
stauden .” V

Jemison quotedfamous people and
proverbs, repeating phrases and the
reﬁain, “time, possibilities and respon-
sibility.” ’

But she cautioned that honoring
Kingslegacyis not about repeatinghis
speeches. It’s about acknowledgingand
developing our skills to effect positive
change. She paraphrasedjapanese poet
Matsuo Basho:

“Do not seek to follow others’

, footsteps,” she said. “Seek what they

sought”
Jernison sought the stars, and she
reachedthem. Speakingonthe ground

_ at Pitt last evening, she spoke about

enjoying all the substance other life.

She ﬁelded questions about the
movie Avatar, her favorite science
ﬁction novels and talked of her love
of dancing, chocolates, cherries and
cats. A

Time only seems to go forward, she
said. But it stretches backward as well.
Ourresponsibilities are not onlyto the
seconds inourdays, buttothoseofwho
came before us.

Jemison became an astronaut like
she dreamed notbecause she had arole
model, she said. She was the ﬁrst.

She said she realized her dream
because she realized the possibilities
that time offered.

“You canbetheﬁrstatwhateveryou
wantto be,” Lewissaid, ‘§As longasthe
ﬁrstwasn’t already taken.”

Greeks prepare
for spring recruits

Three major councils plan events in Union for recruitment

Johannajones
For The Pitt News

Many of Pitt’s fraternity and sorority or-
ganizations will kick off the spring se-
mester by beginning spring recruitment
tonight. » '

Pitt’s three main Greek councils —— In-
terfraternity Council, the National Pan-
Hellenic Council and the National Panhel-
lenic Conference — will hold events in the
William Pitt Union until Friday.

Each organization will" have tables with
current members representing individual
chapters. Spring recruitment is a lessfor—
mal, laid—back process and gives interested

‘ students the chance to visit all of the tables

and decide which chapter best fits their
interests and goals.

“There’s a spot for everyone,” Nicole
Ciofﬁ, president of Panhel, said.

The three councils serve different
groups within the Pitt community. IFC
serves fraternity organizations on campus
and has 17 individual chapters. Panhel con-
sists of 11 nationally ‘recognized sororities

Meet the Greeks will take place in the William Pitt Union today at 8 p.m. as an
orientation for prospective Greek members.

and two multicultural sorority chapters.
' NPHC consists of nine historically African?
American sororities and fraternities.
Jada Ginyard, the president of NPHC,
discussed what kind of members the or-
ganization hopes to recruit. ,
“We are looking for men andwomen
who have and will continue to serve their
community, achieve academically, have
good leadership skills and a certain zeal
about themselves,” Ginyard said.
IFC events begin at 8 p.m. in the WPU
ballroom. Each fraternity house will host
its own events during the recruitment pro-

, cess, which will endjan. 29.

Panhel’s recruitment registration will
begin at 8 p.m. in the WPU Assembly Room.
The recruitment process lasts a week and
culminates with “Bid Day” onJan. 27.

NPHC will begin events in the Lower
Lounge at 8:30 p.m. The council’s recruit-
ment lengths vary depending on its indi-
vidual chapters.

IFC President Derek Carless had advice
for possible recruits.

“Come with an open mind and ready to
be social,” Carless said.

‘We’re not trying to hurt any student’ s future’

District Attorney Stephen Zappala explains that Pitt worked with his office to administer communityrservice program

G-20 1 1

DA’s office has offered offenders a chance to ~

complete community service in exchange for
reducing or expunging their criminal charges.
Zappala said the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police
implemented a similar program last Febru-
ary to punish those arrested during demon-
strations following the Steelers’ Super Bowl
victory.

“I think I can speak for both the Pitt and

the Pittsburgh police departments and say
this program recognizes that students were
expressing a matter of principle, a matter of
belief,” Zappala said. “They may have vio-
lated the law, but they don’t deserve to have
a criminal record because of it.”

Zappala said 23 demonstrations took place
in Oakland during the G-20, involving more
than 10,000 people. Twenty of the protests

were considered lawful, he said, and three
were not. During the three illegal demonstra-
tions, which took place Thursday,_Friday and
Saturday nights, police arrested-about 200
people — half of whom opted to complete
community service. , .

“We asked Pitt to ﬁnd some activity where
‘ the students could help the University, and

the University could help the students,” Zap-

" pala said. “We’ve already had a large number

of students move through the program. If the
University tells us that they are satisﬁed with
the students’ volunteer work, then that is ﬁne
with this office.”

' Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedelé said the Uni:

versity’s Student Volunteer Outreach Program
sentout a letter directing arrested students to
local volunteer groups like Pittsburgh Care —
an online service that connects prospective

_ ‘volunteers with local nonproﬁts. He added

that Pitt did not assistvnon-students.
Martin, who plans to get a master’s degree

in education and eventually teach Latin, said ‘

he logged 44 of the 50 hours as of Monday
night through Pittsburgh Care and expects
to complete them by today.

He logged hours at a food pantry in South
Oakland and other hours renovating a di-‘
lapidated house in'Shadyside -4 repainting
walls and stuffing bags of groceries. While
Martin maintains that he did not deserve to
be arrested in the ﬁrst place, he has enjoyed
the community service process so far.

“I actually had a good time renovating that
house,” Martin said. “When I ﬁrst started, I
felt like I was beingwrongly punished. After a
while, though, it was kind of cool. I got to help
old ladies carry groceries around Oakland
and help rebuild a house. It was deﬁnitely
satisfying.” , -

Zappala said that people who entered the

program but fail to complete the 50 hours

will not necessarily be found guilty. Rather,

their charges will be reinstated, and the trial

process will start from the beginning. I
“We have found that most people, both

those who were arrested and those taking.

part in the prosecution, ﬁnd the program to
be very fair,” Zappala said. “I understand and

« support the actions of the police during the

G—2o, but still, we’re not trying to hurt any

A student’s ﬁiture.”

Scholarships help

ou don’t need us to tell you
that college is expensive.

Whether you’re an in—state '

or out—of-state student, you can ex-
pect to pay more next year if you’re
sticking around.

In 2009, the average cost at
public universities of tuition, room,
board, books and other expenses
rose by 518 percent, or $1,062, ac-
cording to U.S. News and World
Report. .

But behold the cash-strapped
college student’s ﬁnancial savior:
the scholarship.

Applying for scholarships isn’t
exactly the most exciting process
— there’s no such thing as free
money. So sit down and start typ-
ling, because you’ll need to craft
those 1,000 words that’ll convince
the esteemed panel your thoughts
on Shakespearian metaphysical
inquiries are the $10,000 answer
-it desires.‘

But the scope of available schol- A

arships might be broader than you
think. ‘ V

Some scholarships limit their
candidates on categories, such as
sex or area of planned study. But
how about a scholarship that’s only
applicable to former golf caddies or
those who don duct tape for prom
dresses? Yes, those are out there.

CNBC recently published a list of
some of the United States’ most off-
beat scholarships. Below are a few of
the lesser known, downright quirky
and perhaps underrated scholar-
ships out there. Some are limited
to high school students, but for a
few you can still apply.

If you’ve spent time on the green,
consider tryingto get some green
from the Evans Scholars Founda-
tion Scholarship to help pay for
college.

The requirements include that
you’ve been a golfcaddie for at least
two years, were nominated by a golf
club, have a solid academic record
and show need for the money. "

applicants.

Participants must enter in pairs
and wear prom outﬁts crafted en-
tirely from duct tape. First-place
winners receive $3,000 from
ShurTech Brands, the scholarship’s
sponsor.

The American Association of
Candy Technologists -— yes, this is
real — offers a $5,000 scholarship
to college students with an interest

. in confectionary technology and

who are majoring in food science,
chemical science or a similar ﬁeld
of study.

The National Potato Council —
yes, this is’ real, too ——- awards one
$5,000 scholarship to a graduate
student each year going into agri-
business.

_ The student, however, must
have a career goal that involves
bettering the potato industry as
well as marked academic achieve-
ment and leadership skills to be
considered.

Companies love getting their
names out, and the scholarships in
some of these cases seem a less di-

, rect form of advertising — all in the

name of promoting education.

But when the potato hits the
fan, we’ll take the help wherever
we can ﬁnd it.

 

Welfare state limits liberties

New sledding rules indicative of overbearing, pestering safety concerns

 
   

Giles Howard
Columnist

The Pittsburgh Department of Pub-
lic Works banned sledding on a hill
in Frick Park and one in Schenley
Park last week, erecting a number
of signs that read “NO SLED RID-
ING PERMITTED” in bold red let-
ters, the Post—Gazette reported.

-Described as a“public service
announcement” by Director of
Public Works Rob Kaczorowski,
the ban can be enforced by [the
police, but violation of the ban
is not punishable with a ﬁne, and
renegade sledders will not be ar-
rested.

Instead, the ban is an effort to
make “people aware that [sled-
ding] is not a sanctioned use of
the property,” Kaczorowski said.
Of course, with two incidents at
Frick Park the weekend before the
signs were posted, the ban is also
an attempt to limit the city’s liabil-
ity in the case of injury and protect
the city from lawsuits.

Without a plan of direct en-
forcement or a ﬁne for violators
of the ban — and with sledding
still permitted on the popular Flag-
staff Hill~—— Pitt students shouldn’t
be too inconvenienced by the new
signs in Frick and Schenley parks.
But the ban disrupted a winter
tradition for many Pittsburghers
who’ve now followed the sign’s in-
structions and ‘stopped sledding on
their favorite hill.

I’m not here to heap public
scorn on Public Works, and I do
take Kaczorowski at his word when
he said that he’s not trying to be
“the Grinch who stole sled rid-
ing,” but I do think that the ban
says something important about
government regulations: They too
often penalize all of society in an
effort to ensure the safety of the
reckless and stupid.

Laws mandating that motor-
cyclists wear helmets, motorists

wear seat belts or that the foods.

we all consume are free of trans fat
are examples of laws and policies
that deprive people of choice in
an attempt to protect them from

themselves.

While it is easy to rail against
these types of laws as unneces-
sarily invasive, such laws are the
logical conclusion of the welfare
state that we live in. After all, the
state has a legitimate interest in

the health of its citizens when the

state is responsible for providing
people with healthcare, education
and food. '
Because a welfare state assumes
these sorts of responsibilities and
pays for them with taxpayer ﬁinds,
our collective tax dollars are tied-
up as investments in other people’s
well-being. For instance, if a mo-
torcyclist chooses not to wear a
helmet, ends up in an accident
and doesn’t have insurance, the
taxpayer and everyone who does
have insurance pay for his medical
expenses through their contribu-

bonds of the welfare state broken

. and individuals forced to take
economic responsibility for their

exercise of personal liberty, the
government would no longer have
cause or justiﬁcation to regulate
a whole host of issues including
everything from what we eat to
what we buy.

The simple truth is that a purer
personal liberty is possible, but it
cannot be realized without sacri-
ﬁcing the public beneﬁts provided
to us all by the welfare state. If we
want to have greater control over
what we ingest and where we sled
— and I think we should —- then
we have to give up the free public
schools, subsidized higher educa-
tion and other taxpayer—funded
public services, like libraries, that
we all currently enjoy.

But this isn’t as radical or im-

The simple truth is that a purer
personal liberty is possible, but it
cannot be realized without sacriﬁcing

public beneﬁts.

tions to the system.

In this way, the economics
of the welfare state devalues in-
dividual liberty and emphasizes
what is economically best for the

‘collective.

If we don’t want to live in a na-
tion of seat belt laws and sledding
regulations, we need to dismantle
the welfare state and the welfare
economy that ties us all together.
If we lived in a city where-a private
police service or ambulance com-
pany responded to things like sled-
ding injuries, I would have no rea-
son to care if someone hurt himself
while recklessly sledding around
trees and cars because he — in-
stead of my tax dollars —— would
be paying for the consequences
of his actions.

Indeed, with the economic

possible as it might sound. Consid-
er that the University of Pittsburgh
operates its own police force, that
private schools consistently out-

perform public ones and that pri- ,

vate ambulance services already
exist throughout the country.
Dismantling the welfare state

_ and privatizing traditionally public

services promises to save taxpay-
ers’ money, increase eiﬁciency and
expand individual liberties as the
economic ties binding us all to-
gether are cut. Of course," it will
have the added bonus of allowing
city residents to sled where they
choose — at their own risk.

Here in America, it’s no secret
that we’re a little late in the game
when it comes to fashion trends.
We scramble to get into trends four

years after they make a European
debut. We’ll buy whichever iteration
we can get the cheapest, sacriﬁcing
ﬁt and quality in a desperate attempt
to appear ‘‘in-the-know.’’ ’

In America, we feel guilty about
everything — possibly a lasting
complex over that whole stomping-

something brings us pleasure, we
shouldn’t have it. We feel guilty about
free time, as if having a few hours to
ourselves each day is something to be
embarrassed about, like it must mean
we don’t work hard enough.

We feel guilty about wearing the

hand, will buy one solid outﬁt a sea-

is impeccable, of course. Sometimes I .

think it would be nice to feel satisﬁed
by buying one designer outﬁt a sea-

Instead, the beauty regimens of Eu-

beauty. They eat and drink to take
care of their skin. They can run out to

Girl meets racial prejudice ‘Next Door’

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ‘ Writer

The Black Girl Next Door: A
Memoir

Jennifer Baszile

Touchstone Books/Simon &
Schuster Trade Paperback
Grade:B

Confronting the idea of prejudice
and racism is not a comfortable ex-
perience as much as it is a necessary

' one. Brave authors and their mem-

oirs can recall experiences relating
to these topics and often open doors
to allow great insight on how to deal
with such issues.

Author Jennifer Baszile opens
another door with “The Black Girl
Next Door,” displaying an ability to
write prose that looks into the past
while being creative all at once.

As a young girl, Baszile grew
up in a time after the civil rights
movement -— a time when laws

were passed that promoted equal-

ity while prejudices still fought the
progression of human rights. The
years between then and now are her

focus.

Baszile lived in a California sub-
urb. In 1975, she was in ﬁrst grade.
She opens her memoir with a de-
ﬁning moment from her childhood
— she beats a white friend in a race
but is told it’s OK she won because
black people had something special
in their feet. ‘

Yet over the course of the mem-
oir, Baszile does not focus solely on
stereotypes and racism.

She easily switches between her
private and public lives, merging the
separate spheres in her memoir. She
recounts being a good black student
at a predominantly white school and
at home not totally understanding
for years the enormity of even being
able to attend such a school.

Her writing is easygoing yet tense
in tone — it allows time for emo-
tions to brew and yet entrances.

The tale of her childhood and ad-

stress of the prejudice he faced in

Dealing with paradoxes in life
while also dealing with puberty,
Baszile has to discover herself for
herself, rather than for a sense of

“When I was asbudent in ceramics, we always

  ‘Panthers not concerned with top-25 status

Even though the Panthers boast a surprising start and a No. 9 ranking, they are focusing their attention on Georgetown

Greg Trietley
Staff Writer

Picked to ﬁnish ninth in the Big East
in the preseason coaches’ poll, the
-Pitt men’s basketball team rose to
N o. 9 in the nation on Monday after
nail—biting wins over Connecticut
and Louisville.

However, Panthers guard Ash-
ton Gibbs said beingin the Top 25
doesn’t matter. '

T, “We’re not worried about rank-
ings,” Gibbs said. “We’re worried
about getting wins.”

What does matter to Gibbs
and his teammates are the No. 12
Georgetown Hoyas (13-3, 4-2 Big
East), who roll into the Petersen
Events Center tonight.

The rankings show Pitt’s im-
provement from the start of the
season, Pitt coachjamie Dixon said,
a start that included tight games
against Wofford and Duquesne.

,, _ “It’s a good run,” Gibbs said. “Ev-
erybody in that locker room knows

what he can do. We really have con-
ﬁdence in each other.”

According to Dixon, Gibbs has
helped Pitt (15-2, 5-0 Big East) to its
undefeated in—conference start, av-
eraging 2o points per Big East con-
test and playing almost the entirety
of every game. The sophomore av-

fends well.”

Gibbs viewed the playing time
as an opportunity to show what he
has. ~

“I’ve been ﬁne,” Gibbs said. “A
lot of ice baths.”

Pitt handled Connecticut’s tran-
sition offense and Syracuse’s 3-point

thers expectedtobe atthis pointin

However, the tell—tale signs were
there when the Panthers struggled
 nonconference games they
should havewon, eveni‘allingtocross-
town rival Duquesne at home.
“During our nonconference sched-
ule,wewerewim1inggamesbytwo or
three or in overtime to teams that we
“should have beat comfortably,” point
guardjania Sims said “We were able
to outlast those teams.” ,

Once the Panthers entered BigEast
play, they realized the same mistakes
they were making in nonconference
would leadtolossesagainstconference
opponents, Sims said. _

One of the major issues for Pitt
has been tumovers. In their past four
losses, the Panthers committed 74
turnovers, which is an average of 18.5
per game.

Againstwestvirginia onjan. 17, the
Panthers committedaseason—high23
turnovers, includingthree consecutive
miscues whentheyhadachancetotie
the game and potentially switch the
momentum to their side.

“West Virginia came down and
hit a three [after the tumovers] and
Ithought thatwas adaggerforus and
we never recovered,” Pitt head coach
Agnus Berenato said.

Another issue for the Panthers,
particularly against West Virginia, is
balanced scoring.

While Sims scored 18 pointsagainst

the Mountaineers, no other Pitt player
reached double ﬁgures. In Pitt’s loss
to Rutgers onjan. 10, only Taneisha
Harrison reached doubleﬁgureswith
13points. '

InPitI’sﬁrstloss to Westvirginia,
Sims onceagaincarriedtheloadwitha
career—high28 points. Brit1:aneyThom- '
as addedlo. Simswas also the leading
scorer in the Marquette defeat onjan.
2, scoring 20 points while Sophronia
Sallardadded 10. —

Afterthe secondwestvirginialoss,
Berenato noted that the lack of a bal-
anced attack contributed to the loss.

“We hadalot ofplayers score points
today, but they had ﬁve in double ﬁg-
ures, andwe onlyhadjania Sims with

.18,” Berenato said. “That was the dif-
_ ference.”

Sims said that despite the losing
streak, the Panthers remain conﬁdent
in their abilities. Once they earn their
ﬁrst Big East victory, Sims said, they
will start rolling.

The Panthers are off to an 11-1-1 start this year, including 290 in EWL play.

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬁ' Writer

Pittwrestlingopened its EastemWrestlingLeague
schedulethispastweekendwithtwo convincing
road victories. The Panthers, ranked 18th in the
nation, ﬁrst dispatched Lock Haven on Friday
28-9 and then Bloomsburg on Sunday 23-12.

The Panthers responded well to a demand-

ing weekend of traveling. After a night match
Friday at Lock Haven, the squad had just one

day to travel about ﬁve hours to Bloomsburg, go .

through weigh—ins and workout before Sunday
afternoon’s matchup. V

“It can be a demanding weekend,” coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “The guys dida really
good jo .” ' ‘

The victories pushed the Panthers to 11-1-1 on
the season and2—o inEWLplay. SixPittwrestlers
wentundefeated ontheweekend. AnthonyZanet-
tasweptdecisions inthe 125—poundweight class,

David Sullivan won both bouts at 174 pounds,’

Zac Thomusseit only yielded three points in his
two matches at the 184 division and Matt Wilps

at 197 and Ryan Tomei at 285 took all bouts for- v

the heavyweights.

Sophomore Tyler Nauman was perhaps the
most impressive on the weekend, dominating
the 141-pound class. At Lock Haven, Natunan
recorded the onlyfall ofthe day, pinning Nikkien
Fauntleroyin4:29. The pinwas Nauman’s eighth
this season and the 26th of his career. Nauman
followed up his performance Fridaywith another
impressive outing Sunday,VdowningBloomsburg’s
Frank Hickman 8-0 for a major decision.

Lock Haven

The Panthers won the ﬁrst match of the eve—.

ningbehind Zanetta, who tookthe decision 13-3,
but fell behind when they lost three of the next
four bouts.Jimmy Conroyfell tojohn Trumbetti
at 133 with a decision of 9-3, Eric Albright lost in
three overtime rounds to Brock Parker 3-2 and
Donnie Tasser lost another close match 4-3 to

Seth Creasy at 149 pounds.
A With Nauman’s fall at 141, the Panthers found
themselves down 3-2 with ﬁve bouts to go. They

‘ would not look back. Pitt swept the remaining

matches, including major decisions by senior
Sullivan at 174 pounds, sophomore Wllps at 197
andTomei, ajunior, at285. ' _ '_ . ‘

Bloomsburg

Freshman Zanetta again set the tone for the
Panthers, who took the ﬁrst three matches of the
day, including Nauman’s 8—o major decision. Pitt,
however, lost the next three bouts at the 149, 157
and 165 weight classes to three ranked Blooms-
burg wrestlers. The Panthers got back on track
with a21o victoryby Sullivan at 174 and didn’tlose
another match the rest of the afternoon.

“Bloomsburg we thought would be a big-

. ger challenge,” Stottlemyer said. “But the guys

brought a pretty good effort and stepped up to

the challenge. To always get a good start out of ‘

Zanetta, that helps a lot. It sets ainice pace.”

Tomeiprovidedanemphaticﬁnishto theday,
witha14—5 drubbingofzac Walsh. Tomeieamed
a major decision for the bout that included ﬁve
takedowns and a near fall for the bonus-point
Wm .

‘°I‘he guysreallystepped up,” Stottlemyer said.
“They wrestled hard.”

The Panthers next turn their attention to
matches at Cleveland State on Thursday and at
home Saturday against the University of Penn-
sylvania. Stottlemyer counts EWL matches as
doubly important and expects challenges ﬁom
both opponents.

Stottlemyer expects his group to continue to
improve asthe seasonwears on and hopes forthe
team to peak at the right time. ‘

“Wehop_ewe’re savingourbestforlastbecause ‘C
we’re gettingbetter,” the coach said. “Wewrestled
better on Sunday than we did on Friday. We’re .

anxious and lookingforward to it.”

“The guys have done a good job and they’ve
bought into the process of working their tail off
year round. It’s paid dividends for us.”

they do.” V ‘
Gibbs agreed with Dixon, notingthe Hoyas’
proclivity for screens and backdoor passes.
“They’re a tough team to guard,” Gibbs

said. “They can shoot the ball, so we got to

contest shots as well. It’s going to be tough
for us.” I “
‘ Statistically, tonight’s game unites the two

youngest teams in the conference, but the
senior-deprived Hoyas still have plenty of
experience.Junior guards Austin Freeman and
Chris Wright, sophomore guard Jason Clark
and sophomore forward Greg Monroe all see
plenty of playing time as Georgetown coach
John Thompson III keeps a short bench.

“Those four guys have played a lot of min-
utes from day one,” Dixon said. “Their starting
ﬁve is as good as anybody in the country.”

Freeman leads all Hoyas with 15.9 points

— per game. Dixon said that the third—year

starter has improved since his seven-point
performance in Georgetown’s 70r54 loss to
-Pitt lastjanuary. ’ ,

“Freeman’s gotten better off the dribble
and playing without the ball,” Dixon said.
“He’s always been a good shooter.”

Gibbs noted that although Freeman has
the ability to knock down shots, the George-
town offense still ‘revolves around the versa-
tile Monroe, who can play underneath the

basket as a center or handle the ball on the .

perimeter. .
“Monroe will play two different spots for

them,” Dixon said. “He’s -got an unbeliev-

able skill set for a guy his size.  He was the
