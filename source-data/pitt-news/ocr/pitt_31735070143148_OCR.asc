Pitt Officials saytheyhope the Univer-

vaccine distribution this fall.

Jay Frerotte, Pitt’s director ofer1vi-
ronmental health and safety, said the
University registered with the state
Department of}-Iealth, requestingper—
missiontodistribute the H1N1vaccine

mid-October. . ’

The University is “in a dialogue”

_ with theAllegheny County Health De-

partment to work out a plan for dis-
tributingthe vaccines when it receives
them, he added. S

The shots will be distributed on a
priority basis. Pregnant Women, chil-

sponders and medical professionals are
high onthe list Peoplewith underlying
medical conditions and college students
are also on the list, Frerotte said.
Aside from that, the priority listfor

For some, today marks year 2002

Ethiopians and Eritreansin Pittsburgh celebrate theirnew year with food, traditional dress and cultural reflection

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Today marks the beginning of a
new year: 2002.

Pitt student Weenta Girmay will
call her grandmother who lives in
Eritrea, an East African country
where the Julian calendar marks
the passage of time. There, the
clock runs from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Western time because the sun rises
earlier. People operate, in a sense,
seven years behind Americans.

Today marks the new year in

Ethiopia and Eritrea, two countries
that share a history dating back
almost 2,000 years.

Girmay won’t go to church to-
day and then come home to feast
on homemadecoffee, wine and in-
jera, a gray ﬂatb read made from a
native Ethiopian grain called teff.
She won’t pick the yellow ﬂowers
that grow in neighboring Ethiopia,
where her parents once lived, and
take them door to door, as Seifu
Haileyesus, owner of Tana Ethio-
pian Cuisine. in East Liberty and
himself an Ethiopian native, re-
members watching the girls in his

town do. _

“You know, it’s sad,” Girmay
said in an e-mail, ‘before ﬂying off
to study abroad in Bolivia. “A lot of
us are Americanized in the sense
that we’re running on American
schedules. You can’t just call off
work to celebrate an all-day new
year.”

So instead, she’ll settle for call-
ing her grandmother, who lives in
Eritrea and speaks the national
language 'ofTigrinya. Girmay never
learned the language, “So Itry my
best tounderstand her, but the
conversation is short, and mostly

it’s just about hearing her voice.”
Back in Ethiopia and Eritrea,
people will gather around a table
with a large communal plate cov-
ered with the injera, which they’ll
pepper it with different stews made
from ground» chickpeas or lentils
and ambasha, a type of round
bread they cut into triangular

_ pieces, almost like a pizza.

‘ They’ll grind coffee by hand,
brew tea and burn incense'as they

' eat until all the food is gone.

This all occurs, of course, after
they’ve gone to church to celebrate
the beginning of the new Julian

year, which most of the world
used until the late 16th century,
when the Roman Catholic Church
created a new one to better align
Easter with the spring equinox,
hence the gap between the Ethio-
pian and Eritrean new years and
the American one. ‘

Many Ethiopians and Eritreans
will wear traditional clothes today:
light, often handwoven, cotton
garments with colorful designs.
The women will wear scarves and

_ braid their hair into cornrows that

run from their scalps to the bottom
of their necks. S

Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.

He remembers the girls in town dressing
up in traditional clothing and going from

would welcome the girls into their homes

tej. The girls would hand them a yellow ﬂow-
er, which only blooms near the new year, A
before heading on to the next home.

In the evenings, Haileyesus -said, he and

Editorial

Pitt must give
swine flu stats

Swine ﬂu permeated Pitt’s cam-
pus at the beginning of September
—— we all knew it was coming.

Carnegie Mellon said it currently
has about200 students on its campus
with ﬂu-like symptoms, while Penn
State’s Health Services reported 30
cases on its campus. But how many
suspected cases does Pitt have? We
don’t know. Pitt is being t1'ght—lipped,
saying only the terse, all—too-familiar
assuagement: Don’t panic.

Jay Frerotte, Pitt’s director of en-
vironmental health, said he would
not specily how many students on
campus had reported ﬂu-like symp-
toms or had been advised to self-
isolate.

“We don’t want to get into the
numbers game. There are active
cases on campus, but there is no
cause for panic,” he said.

Amid the media hype and abun-
dant warnings — some of the most
recent caution signs include the
catchy W.H.A.C.K. posters around
campus and the swine ﬂu advise-
ment e-mail that Dean of Students
Kathy Humphrey sent to students
— perhaps the biggest fear is fear
itself. Ofﬁcials don’t want to start
a panic.

There’s a difference, however,
between not wanting to incite
panic and withholding information
from the student body. Perhaps Pitt
doesn’t know the exact number of
students afflicted with swine ﬂu, but
it should know how many have re-
ported ﬂu-like symptoms. Hopeﬁilly
our numbers aren’t as large as Car-
negie Mellon’s or Washington State
University’s, where it has reported
around 2,500 cases, or around 13
percent of its student body. But no
matter how looming the ﬁgure, Pitt

 

students should be informed, rather
than left in a state of dubious un-
certainty. ' V l

Pitt’s reticence on this issue also
makes us wonder: If there is no rea-
son to panic, why don’t they pro-
vide numbers? Should H1N1 become
more proliﬁc in the coming months,
ofﬁcials can’t hide behind the pro-
verbial “don’t panic” safety net for-

ever. Again, they’re trying to prevent '

panic, but at some point, soothing
becomes deception , a shallow at-
tempt at reassurance. At some point
there is legitimate cause for concern,
and students deserve to decide for
themselves when that point is.

If students aren’t apprised to the
numbers, especially if the number
of cases substantially grows, some
will continually ignore preventative
measures — such as hand washing
—— whereas they might not have had
they been aware of the number of
cases.

Also, when the H1N1 vaccine
becomes available to Pitt students
later this fall, students can more ap-
propriately judge whether theywant
to receive it if they know the extent
of their risk.

Of_ﬁcials seem wary that a panic
could provoke more students with
ﬂu-like symptoms to head for the

Student Health Center instead of do- I

ing what they’ve been instructed to
do: self-isolate. If Pitt is worried that
releasing the ﬁgures could encourage
more students to visit Student Health
rather than the recommended pro-
tocol, then it simply needs to further

its education campaigns, because -

being open about what’s going on is
the only responsible way to handle
this. ' '

When the ﬁrst plane hit the World

years ago today, Iwas playing-Snake on

move at the time — getting caught
with your cell phone in school war-
ranted a one—day suspension, and,
upon exhausting my lives, I wisely
turned it off. We discussed the ﬁrst
act of “Romeo and Juliet” without
fanfare.

As the events of the day trans-
pired, we were actively kept unaware
byfaculty, who were instructed notto
comment onthe chaos transpiring13
miles away so as to avoid disrupting
education as usual.

This precaution proved futile,
however. Over the course of the day,
my eighth grade class of 35 dwindled
down to, 13, as parents pulled their
children out of school for the day, one
by one.

. It wasn’t until eighth period that
those ofus remainingwerebriefed on

whyexactlyzz ofus were M.I.A. —our
biology teacher’s son worked in the
South Tower, and she hadn’t heard
from him all day.

She disclosed why she was emo-
tionallyinno shape to follow through
with her lesson on Darwin’s ﬁnches.
Then, her son called the classroom
phone with less than 10 minutes left
inthe period. ~

Upon leaving the building, I pow-
ered up my new phone to ﬁnd voice-
mails from both of ‘my parents, eight
hours aftertheﬁrstexplosion. I knew
thattheywere OK, and itwasn’t until I
got home and tuned into CNN that the
day’s events were paired with images
and ﬁrst-hand accounts.

In my case, the events of that day
emerged slowly, especially by today’s
standards.

My Nokia had been effectively in- -

In fact, many media scholars and

Say hello to my little rant

The new Pitt T-shirts displayed in Forbes Avenue storefronts don’t make any sense

Erik Hinton
Managing Editor

 

It is no secret that T—shirts with
sayings on them make their wear-
ers into rubes. Nothing commu-
nicates such lamentable cultural
ignorance as walking around with
“That’s what she said” splayed
across your chest.

Now, if this little tirade I’m
starting off on sounds tired, you
are exactly right. As American Ap-
parel and Urban Outﬁtters white-
wash the torsos of young adults
with bright, solid colors, the sun
begins to set on the rein of No Fear,
Bigjohnsons, the Hot Topic fran-
chise. All seems to be well.

is worrisome for reasons beyond

“Say Hello to my Little Friend”
tees are a bellwether pointing the
way to new heights of cultural in-
dolence. .
Stupid fashion is nothing new.
The ’8os were a decade devoted
.to pushing the boundary between
clothing and ﬂotsam and jetsam
(cf. “Breakin” and “Breakin 2: Elec-
tric Boogaloo”). The ’90s similarly
wrapped ‘trash up in a cutesy la-
bel, “grunge,” and the transition to
the aughts (2ooo—2oo9) brought
in a slew of ironic fashions (the
sarcastic shirt, the romper, big
glasses). ,
However, what separates these
cultural indiscretions from the
new Pitt shirts is that usually silly
fashion ties up with some broader

cultural move. The absurdity of

Boogaloo Shrimp’s clothing or that
of the chubby girl whose crew neck
alleges, “I slept with your boy-
friend,” is at leastmarginally co-
herent within its own community
(breakers, party chicks, etc.). Even

a little niche for its devotees.
“Say Hello to my Little Friend,”
however, makes pains not to be
recognizable. It is so vanilla as to
almost be an event horizon out of
which no traces of personality or
culture may escape. I
‘ I am ‘sure similar lines have
been penned about other superﬁ-
cially similar fashion, such as the
equally ‘strange Abercrombie/
Hollister/American Eagle tees.
Compare though, Abercrombie’s
somewhat new shirt that boasts
in bold letters, “Fiscally Republi-
can, Socially Democrat, Sexually
Liberal.” At ﬁrst, you might think,
“Oh, just another sex joke from
the'boys at A&F.” I, too, thought’
I was above Abercrombie’s shirt
untilI remarked, guffawing, “Isn’t
that what every Abercrombie shirt
says implicitly anyway?” Then, it
dawned on me:_ That’s the point.
Red-faced, I knew
Abercrombie had won.
Digressions aside, what this ex-
perience taught me was that a lot of
thought goes into making a cloth-
ing line that seems like no thought
went into it. Creating culture that
is shallow on top but rooted in le-
gitimate thought is hard work; It’s

g sleight-of-hand, a magic show with

less masks and less (read: just as

The danger in such seemingly
benign fashion is not that it en-
courages bad culture — there is no
such thing. It encourages people to
trade culture for a hodgepodge of
vaguely cultural references (in this
case, a school, a football team and
“Scarface”). Such a move frustrates I
the ostensible end of culture, to
bring people together, and tries
to trade being in a certain culture
for just being in culture.

Now, I am surely being unfair.
You could very well ask, “What
really is culture besides ‘a hodge-
podge of vague references’?” I
would not object too strongly.
Furthermore, as much as I would
like to say that the “Little Friend”
shirts are outside of any speciﬁc

. culture, they could very easily be

integrated into one. .

The point is, though, that cul-
ture and all of its trappings, even
silly shirts, deserve attention and
energy. Maybe you are the kind of
person who doesn’t value fashion
or looking any speciﬁc way, but
know that that, too, is a cultural
decision. Do not underestimate
its signiﬁcance by supporting lazy
cultural products.

Post—9/ 11 news

more accessible

Korman 4 6

all this -— since last Sept. 11, the Web
has evolved from a largely computer-
based medium into a mobile experi-
ence.

Today it’s all the more evidentthat
Sept. 11 forever changed the way we
experience breaking news and na-
tional tragedy.

Whenjapanese bombers hit Pearl
Harbor, radio stations covered the
event until newspapers hit stands
the next day, introducing listeners to
the ﬁrst truly live news event. Follow-
ing the assassination of_]FK in 1963,
all three major television networks,
for the ﬁrst time ever, canceled their
regularprogrammingand covered the
tragedy continuously, for four days
straight.

-~ Sept—.«11»passed~the baton to the
Internet, and today, it’s amid an explo-
sion ofhyperactivity. Blogs are emerg-
ing as a ﬁnancially viable publishing
platform. Political crises overseas
are disseminated in 140-character
vignettes, bypassingthe ever—present
media middleman. ,3 ‘

First and foremost, today is a day
of remembrance and reﬂection. Many
lives were cut short, amongthempar-
ents of my classmates, some ofwhom
remained unaware of the attacks until
eighth period.

Had today’s media landscape
been in place back then, the story
would likely have-found its way to us

i far earlier —— be it through one rogue
student who kept hisphone on or a
Web—equipped computer lab, we’d
have been able to share the moment
with one another, understanding and
empathizinginrealtime.AndinMrs.
Gentile’s class, we wouldn’t have dis-
cussed Shakespeare—we’d have dis-
cussed history, as itwas happening.

Indian Ocean meets the three rivers  

Global band Indian Ocean will perform at Carlow University ’s Antonian Theatre Sept. 12.

Natalie Bell
Staff Writer

One thing is for sure — a global
band with an upcoming show beats
the hell out of the Atlantic Ocean.

Sometimes it takes longer than
expected‘ for the world to catch on
to something special, like Indian
Ocean.

The Indian contemporary band
will be performing at Carlow Uni-
versity’s Antonian Theatre on Sept.
12 at 6:30 p.m.

With inﬂuences that range from
Indian classical to rock, the band
gets classiﬁed as anything from In-

dian folk rock to Indian jazz. Even '

Rahul Ram, bassist and vocalist, ad-

. mitted that the band hasn’t found a

“A lot of people ask us what
genre we’d be in, and we aren’t sure
ourselves,” Ram said. “Listento the

 

music and come up with where you
think we fall into.”

The band’s first album sold

“That ridiculous [of a response]
and most people would have given
up and gone home, but it sounded
so good to us that we said, ‘Look
we don’t care.’ The response of the
audience and our own conviction in
our music kept us going. We were
so convinced this music was good,
so we just did it,” said Ram,

Despite a discouraging start, In-
dian Ocean’s determination, contin-
ued belief in itself and hardwork
eventually proved the hand right.

Since then, the group has had
success with its albums, including

A ‘Real World’ intervention — the hard truth  

Kieran has a message for “The Real World”: Sorry, but you’re boring

by Kieran Layton
Ae9’E E9itor

 

Dear MTV’s “The Real World,”

I think we need to have a little
chat. No, please, no tequila, and put
the camera down. This is beyond th
Confessional. '

As of Wednesday night, yet an-
other season of your eponymous
reality show ended, and once again,
the mass youth consumers of trashy
television must go without their ﬁx
until spring when the next season
premieres.

Imean, I am in a personal frenzy.
What will I do without my weekly
dose of self-deprecating 20-some-
things sacriﬁcing their dignity and
livers all in the name of steady rat-
ings and 14-and-a-half minutes of
fame?

Nevermind   has W

volved from a poignant examination
of hot button topics like homosexu-
ality, racism, religion and AIDS into
a show with only the most miniscule
traces of social relevance — I pre-

fer my ‘guilty pleasures as guilty as

possible.

But see, thethingis, “Real World,”
you aren’t even a guilty pleasure any-
more. Over the past few (four? ﬁve?)
seasons, you have committed the
sin of the reality show universe —
you’ve become downright boring.

That’s why I think you should
seriously consider putting me in
the house of seven — scratch that,
eight — strangers to wreak havoc
and create some truly awesome
television.

Seriously, I believe I possess
many of the requisite traits you
look for in a cast member. Family
history full of painful memories?
Check. Alternativg outlook on life

and a  menta1ity?§(ep..

Apersonality that just begs to simul-
taneously attract and drive my fellow
roommates crazy? Deﬁnitely. A full

willingness to exploit IIIYS-elffor the I
.__-amusementvof-millionswofviewers? ‘

For sure. / V V

Isn’t this what you’re looking for,
“Real World?” I could certainly give
even the craziest characters in your
past a run for their money. Trishelle
from “Las Vegas,” eat your heart out.
Tyler from “Key West,” watch your

back.

You know what, “Real World,”
I understand your skepticism — I
also know your reputation for disap-
pointing your biggest fans. So even
if it’s not me, why not pick one of

 

 You have committed
the sin of the reality
show universe — you’ve
become downright

my many friends, or perhaps any
random Pitt student?

I know fora fact we would be I
‘morevinteresting’-than ‘any of the "

recent specimens of the college mi-
crocosm you have displayed in the
past few years.

The shenanigans that my friends
andvlv get into on a Friday night are
twice as entertaining as anything
from “The Real World: Cancun.”

E PI"? I

Penn State student Bronne throw-
ingaﬁre extinguisher off the balcony
of a hotel? .

Please, I have witnessed actual
people getting thrown off of balco-
nies. And if you’re looking for the
b*tch of the group, I know plenty of
them,too (myselfincluded).

But then again, I suppose you’re
already trying your absolute hardest
to ﬁnd the perfectly dysfunctional
cross—section of American college
students, which must mean the fault
for the lack of interest in recent sea-
sons of your show lies in the hands
of me and my peers.

Backwhenlwas in high school —
or even, GASP, middle school —— sea-
sons of “The Real World” enthralled
me with their unabashed displays
of debauchery and the promise of
similar times when I reached the

- then—elusive mecca of freedom that
‘is college.  ' l  I

Now, however, all of the suppos-
edly wild antics merely remind me of
how much crazier my college life is
than you, and also how much more
intellectually stirnulatinga conversa-
tion at Starbucks can be compared
to some of the “real” topics the cast

members discuss on your show.

Is this a symptom of growing up?
Probably — my younger sister and
her high school friends still eat the
show up on aweekly basis. The nov-

elty of you dissipated long ago — T’

have met some of your former vic-
tims/cast members and know others
loosely through mutual friends, and
the reality of their normalcy seri-
ously diminishes the attraction.

So, “Real World,” I guess there’s
really nothing left to be said. We
have just drifted, like many of my
television relationships, and I hate
to say it, but you have some serious
growing up to do.

Or maybe you need to ramp u_
the immaturity some more. There s
no such thing as an overload of trash-
iness in a tacky reality show.

Either way, I think it’s time we
take some time apart. I’ll look for you
next season —- the blogosphere says
the “Washington D.C.” cast looks
promising.

Until then,

Kieran Layton

P.S. I was only half-kidding about
being on the show. You’ve never had
a “Kieran” before. Call me!

World band brings Indian,

Indian Ocean 4 8

when we recorded that album, we took it to
all the music companies in India.

To get it into the iTunes top 10 is so much
a vindication of our conﬁdence in ourselves,”
Ram said.

The band has also had several ﬁrsts for
an Indian band —— a live concert recording
and a documentary. _

The group has also been asked to record
for several Bollywood movies, such as “Black
Friday.” - ‘

Indian music might not be a genre you’ve
thought of listening to before, but jhini, In-
dian Ocean’s latest album, is a combination
of sounds that you might associate with In-
dian music with clear inﬂuences from other
genres.

Jhini has a very interesting ﬂair and a
sound that’s almost impossible to describe.

It’s contemporary Indian music spiced with
ﬂavors of jazz, rock and folk — all blending
to create a deliciously different sound.
While a ﬁrst—time listener might be hesir
tant about delving into international music,
the energy of the musicians and captivating
sounds will erase any second thoughts.  2 ,
After hearing the album, _it’s clear why
the band is known for its live performances
The liveliness of the songs and performers,i_s
apparent even in the album and would be un-
doubtedly even more dramatic in concert.
“Frankly, we love playing live, and we
sound much better live than not, and a lot
of people who hear us for the ﬁrst time get
completely blown away,” Ram said.
“It’s not about sitting down quietly. Come

clap, dance, do whatever you want, just have A
a lot of fun.” I -

Pitt, Buffalo sizeeachotherupbefore game

Pitt prepares to counter Buffalo wide receiver Naaman. Roosevelt

Kyle Craig
Staff Writer

7-’?

The term “trap game” is often tossed
around when a team from a tradi-
tiénally superior conference goes
on'the road to playaprogram that is
irrelevant in the national scene.

- With that in mind, Pitt (1-0) at
Btiffalo (1-0) seems like the perfect
scene for unexpected disaster.

However, the Panthers have been

down this road before. Coach Dave .

Wannstedt knows that playing a
Mid-American Conference (MAC)
opponent at home or on the road can
be difficult. Losses to Bowling Green
last year and Ohio Universityinzoos
have taught him as much.

if Those results, combined with
Buffalo’s determined performance
in a 26-17 loss at Heinz Field last

season, should be enough to get
the Panthers’ attention. Wannstedt
discussed the challenges that Buffalo
presents during a press conference
on Tuesday.

“They’re playing with a lot of
conﬁdence right now,” he said.
“They had a big win on the road at
[Texas—El Paso] last weekend. We
know that this is a huge game for
them up there.”

Whilethis mightbe anormal out-
of~conference game for Pitt, Buffalo
is ready to make a national statement
on the heels of its MAC Champion-
ship victory last season. '

“I think we’ve done some things

that have established our program‘

[so] we are to be reckoned with,”
Buffalo coach 'I‘urner Gil said. “We
can compete against anybody. We
play to win, so I anticipate us to
play well and for us to win the ball

game.”

Wannstedt indicated that he
has discussed the importance this
game holds for the Bulls with his
own players.

“Our guys need to be aware of
the environment we’re going into.

4 They know that we’re facing a good

football team. We’re not going to be
surprised by anything,” Wannstedt
said.

Part of Pitt’s preparation is con-
structing a game plan to account
for standout wide receiver Naaman
Roosevelt. Last week, Roosevelt
caught ﬁve passes, including a 42-
yard touchdown reception.

“He’ll be as talented of a receiver ,

as we’ll face all year long. He has the
speed, the size, and he’s got good
handsto go with it,” Wannstedt said.
“He’s not a secret, and they’ll get the
football to him.”

On the other side, Gil had high
praise for Pitt’s defense. In particu-

Pitt a defensive challenge

Buffalo coach calls Pitt “the best defense that we face this year”

Football 4 11

lar, Gil highlighted the defensive front of Greg
l_{omeus, Jabaal-Sheard, Gus Mustakasand
Mick Williams.

’ “They probably will be the best defense that
we face this year,” Gil said. “The front seven
might be the best we’re going to face.”

_ Pitt’s defense will test sophomore quarter-
back Zach Maynard, -who went 12-o_f—19 with
a touchdown during his ﬁrst start. Maynard.
also possesses the ability to make plays with
his feet, a skill that other quarterbacks have
used to ﬁnd success against the Panthers in
the past. 1‘

One player who Pitt won’t need to prepare

’ for is senior running backjames Starks. Dur-

ing their last meeting, Starks rushed for 97
yards on 20 carries. This year, a labrum tear
in his shoulder has prematurely ended Starks’ '
career. ’

Attempting to replace Starks’ production
is junior Brandon Thermilusiand senior Mario
Henry. Together the two backs combined for
134 yards on 36 carries and two touchdowns
against El Paso.

As for the Pitt running game, freshman
Dion Lewis gets his ﬁrst opportunity to run

the ball in a hostile environment. While Lewis
impressed in his debut with 129 rushing yards
and three total touchdowns, he won’t have the
luxury of competing against Football Cham-
pionship Subdivision teams, like Youngstown
State, anymore this season. .6 ..
Three of the Panthers’ next four games
are away from Heinz Field. Traveling was‘: a

~ strength of the team last season, as it wenns‘-1

‘on the road, losing only to eventual Big East
champion Cincinnati. .  1

“We were apretty good road team last
year,” Wannstedt said. “If you’re going to Be a
good football team, you’re going to have to deal
with not just the adversity, but the variables
that go into traveling.” _ ‘

If Pitt hopes to have continued success away
from home, it will have to avoid becoming a
signature victory for a football program try-
ing to make a name for itself. The Bulls appear
eager for the chance to gain recognition? by
knocking Pitt off. :9; 'l‘

“We’re going to have a fantastic challenge,”
Gil said. “We’re actually looking forward to
it.” ' 1'5  .

Big East < 12

Alter that, itwas all Cincinnati, as
it rattled off 38 unanswered points.
It’s clear the best duo in the Big East
is Pike and wide receiver Mardy Gil-
yard, who caught eight passes for 89
yards and a score. Both will contend
for Big East Player of the Year.

. Thanks to Cincinnati’s per-
formance, the Big East has its
ﬁrst ranked team of the year. The
Bearcats came in at No. 23 in the AP
and USA Today polls this week.

 Before Monday’s game, the rest
of the Big'East went 5-1 all in out-of-

'. conference games. The lone loser

was Syracuse, which lost 23-20 in
overtime to Minnesota.

Quarterback Greg Paulus didn’t
look bad in his debut with the Or-
ange, as the team scored 20 points
inthe ﬁrst quarter, but he did throw
an interception in overtime to open
the door for Minnesota to win.
