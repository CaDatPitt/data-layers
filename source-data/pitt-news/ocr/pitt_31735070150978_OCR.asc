The Pitt volleyball season ended in
November at the Big East tourna-
ment, but for one weekend in Feb-
ruary,jasmine_ Dittrich returned to
the court and experienced some
intense competition.

USA Volleyball hosted tryouts
for its national team in Colorado
Springs, Colo., and welcomed a
record number of more than 250
athletes from across the country.
The purpose’ of the tryouts was to
identify potential players for the
United States women’s national
volleyball team program, a full-
time competition squad.

Dittrich, a middle blocker with
one year of collegiate eligibility for
the Panthers remaining, traveled
to Colorado and, uponher return,
reﬂected on her time spent with
some of the top volleyball players
in theination.

“Some of the girls at the tryouts
were ridiculously good,” Dittrich
said. “It was an honor "to have
played with All—Americans and
the best players in the country.
Needless to say, it was extremely
competitive and there was a ton of
passion on the court.”_

After transferring to Pitt from

- Minnesota in 2011, Dittrichmade

an immediate impact for the Pan-
thers, earning a start in 31 of the
team’s 33 matches. Last season,

Violence Against Women Act reauthorized

0

' Natalie Daher
' Stqff Writer

Changes recently adopted to the '
Violence Against Women Act could , ‘

lead‘ to new measures combating

sexual violence on college campuses

nationwide. ,
A revised version of the VAWA
was signed into law on'Feb. 28, and it

’ incorporated protections for groups

that were not previously recognized
in its initial 1994 draft. Congress
previously revised VAWA in 2000,
2005 and 2012, and the update this
year extended protections for immi-
grants and members of the LGBTQ
community as well as women. -

On March 7, President Barack
Obama included the Campus Sexual
Violence Elimination Act (Campus
SaVE) in the VAWA reauthorization.
This law will require institutions of
higher education like Pitt to take
preventative measures to address
issues regarding domestic violence,
dating violence, sexual assault and
stalking. '

Prior to the 1970s, “sexual ha- _

rassment” was a term that barely
existed in American political dis-
course. But the growing legislation

' against it — including the Civil
_ _ Rights Act of 1964, the Title IX Act

of 1972 and the Campus SaVE Act
of 2013 — exhibit the incremental

Pitt to comply with new m'te7'in

progress of the nation in recognizing
and combating the issue.
As an extended version of the

- Clery Act of 1990, which requires
, universities to disclose sexual crime
statistics publicly, the Campus SaVE _

Act takes an additional step by ad-
dressing the need for preventative
measures.

Sex crimes are prevalent on col-

lege campuses, but they are rarely ,

reported. A survey conducted by the
National Institute ofjustice in 2007

' reported that 19 percent of females

on college campuses experience
attempted or completed sexual ‘as-

of the project and a brief description of the
project idea.

The Board has received a total of six
project proposals through the link since it
was posted injanuary. Louderback said that
project ideas include more access to outside
basketball courts and more speciﬁc schedules
of campus shuttles that run in South Oakland.

Other proposals dealt with campus living. -
Louderback said one such project ideawas to

create a housing gallery to help better inform ’

Pitt students of their on—campus housing
options. He added that the Board would de-
cide at a later date whether it would pursue‘
the development of an open-house option
for students that would allow them to tour
different dormitories or a video that would
provide virtual tours.

“It’s a way for rising sophomores and

. juniors to get a View _of the residence halls

they’re applying to live in the following year,”
Louderback said. ‘ _

Another recommendation called for the
Board to provide a resource for informa-
tion on renting apartments and dealing with

landlords.

Board member Dave Rosenthal, who has
been working on lessening landlord and
apartment-rental issues, said that there is
a database of different landlords available
through the Ofﬁce of Oﬂf-Campus Living.
Rosenthal is working on getting classes or-
ganized to educate students who want to
move off campus on the matters of leases,
apartments and landlords.

Other Board members also provided up-
dates on the progress of their projects at the
meeting. . — . ‘=

sault, yet less than 5 percent of sexual crimes
are reported. The survey indicated that major
reasons behind keeping hush included fear of
others’ judgments, fear of retaliation by the
perpetrator and lack of knowledge on how
to report the crime. '

According to Pitt, a total of 15 forcible sex
offenses were reported on campus between
the years of 2009 and 2011, while 11 were
reported of campus.

Speciﬁcs of the Act

The Campus SaVE Act requires that uni-
versities take speciﬁc actions to prevent, ju-
dicate and eliminate sex crimes on campus.
According to the Clery Center for Security on
Campus, the act is anchored on platforms of
transparency,accountability, education and
collaboration.

Building its recommendations on these
four pillars, the act requires that schools create
annual reports of documented sexual crimes.
Furthermore, students or employees must be
provided with printed information about ac-
commodations that will be made for victims
of sexual violence. These accommodations
may include direct assistance from campus au-
thorities, adjustments to their schedules and
residences to evade hostility, clear descrip-
tions of their schools’ disciplinary policies and
contact information for medical, counselin
or legal services. '

Additionally, educational programs must

be instituted for incoming students and em-
ployees when they arrive on campus. These
educational measures include prevention and
awareness programs, information about se-
cure tactics for bystander intervention and
information about the red ﬂags of abusive
and dangerous behavior.

The SaVE Act establishes cooperation be-
tween the U.S. departments ofjustice, Edu-
cation and Health and Human Services. The
act has ‘also been endorsed by 29 organiza-
tions, including the Clery Center for Security
On Campus, the One Love Foundation, the
Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape and the
National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.

The legislation also demands that univer-
sities abide by minimum standards in legal

handlings of sex—crime cases. The proceedings -

must include a thorough and objective inves-
tigation, and each party involved has rights
to the accompaniment of an adviser and the
receipt of printed verdicts at the same time.

Politicians weigh in _ »
Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey introduced
the Campus SaVE Act ‘in 2010, and it faced
much congressional gridlock along the way.
Earlier this year, it passed through the Senate
by a vote of 78 to 22 and the House of Rep-
resentatives by 286 to 138, with Democrats
unanimously supporting the bill and 87 Re-
publicans voting in the affirmative.
According to an email from Casey’s press
secretary, John Rizzo, the senator “believes
the Campus SaVE Act is important because it
closes a serious gap in current law by requir-

ing colleges and universities to clearly spell
out their policies regarding sexual violence
on campus.”

House Republicans who refuted the re-
authorization of VAWA supported their own
version of the bill that included only limited
protections for Native Americans and mem-

bers of the LGBTQ community and didn’t in-

clude the Campus SaVE Act. This version of
the bill was rejected 257 to 166 in the House.
Laura Mengelkamp, the press secretary
for Repulican Sen.]ohn Barrasso of Wyoming,
said that although Barrasso supports VAWA,
he voted against the bill that Obama signed
into law because it “included a number of
controversial, unconstitutional provisions.”

Mengelkamp didn’t disclose why Barrasso
believed portions of the bill were unconsti-
tutional.

"‘As a doctor who has treated victims of
domestic violence, Sen. Barrasso has worked
throughout his career to help protect women,”

 Mengelkamp said in an email. “Because he

strongly supports VAWA, Sen. Barrasso voted
in favor of an alternative bill that wo‘uld4ad-
dress these concerns.”

VAWA on Campus ' . -
Pitt’s administration must now harmonize

. its current sexual violence codes with those

outlined in the Campus SaVE Act.

Ted Fritz, an associate general counsel at l

the University, said that VAWA will not create

4 too many changes for Pitt. He said that Pitt

has “always taken sexual assault and domestic

violence seriously” through such measures as
instituting an anti-sexual violence program
and preventative components such as the
SAFE program, which requires the establish-
ment of a sexual assault examiner program

‘ in hospitals,, a Title IX coordinator, Sexual A
Assault Services, a student judicial system and

a responsive campus police force.

But Campus Women’s Organization Presi-
dent Bella Salamone said that Pitt’s current
standards aren’t sufficient and that the Cam-
pus SaVE Act — particularly the educational
aspect of it — is a step in the right direction. As
a peer educator for the Sexual Assault Services

program inthe counseling center, Salamone '

is often disappointed by the turnout at non-
mandatory workshops about sexual violence
that she‘ runs.

- “If people aren’t coming to the workshops
because there’s not a requirement that your
dorm has to attend this workshop, then that
information isn’t going anywhere,” she said.

Additionally, Salamone said that she hopes
Pitt’s campus changes in terms of street ha-
rassment and allows women to feel saferwhile
traveling by foot at night. She feels that every

_ female student on campus could share an an-

ecdote about being taunted by a cat call while
walking Oakland during the late-night hours.

. She attributes this to a “hostile environment”
for female students.

“Obviously not everything is sunshine and

daisies,” she said. “But it would be nice if we '

have an environment where not every female

student has a story about suffering street ha— i

rassment.” I ~

Victoria’s Secret marketing move
no cause for moral panic  

Tracey. Hickey
Columnist

On Monday, I watched a 2011 docu-
mentary called “Girl Model” about
the international fashion indus-
try. Speciﬁcally, it’s about the way
modeling agencies recruit girls
as young as 13 from developing
countries, promise them wealthy
and glamorous lives as models,‘
exploit their labor and then send
them home thousands of dollars
in debt. The documentary follows
one girl, Nadya, as she travels -from‘
her home in Siberia to Tokyo and
struggles to make a living from ,
sporadic and underpaid model-
ing work. _ '

That is the dirty secret of the
modeling industry, even in Amer-
icawhen only American girls are
being used; it is a market relatively .
untouched by labor laws. A 12-hour
working day for a 15-year-old mod-
el is not illegal, nor is overtime
payment required. In fact, there’s
no minimum wage — models are
frequently “paid” with the cloth-
ing they wore in the shoot, despite
the vast quantities of money in the

- fashion industry and the physically

taxing nature of ‘a mode1’sjob. -
Meanwhile, people are com-
pletely freaking out about Vic-

toria’s Secret introducing a new
line of underwear — in the lingerie

t giant’s typically racy style that in— V

eludes ﬂirty sayings inscribed on
many of the, pieces —— geared to-

ward preteen girls. Blogs with titles

such as ‘-‘Victoria’s Secret Is Com-
ing For Your Middle Schoolers,”
petitions from Texas ministers and
boycott threats from concerned
moms have erupted across the
Internet as America collectively
decries our children’s descent into
scantily- clad amorality.

It would be irresponsible to
discuss the. new preteen lingerie
line without ﬁrst debunking a few
myths about teen sexuality. If you
watch the news, you might have the
idea that young people have gotten

- steadily more promiscuous since

the famed “sexual revolution” of
the 1960s; in fact, the reverse is
true. 0 ' ' V
According to the Guttmacher
Institute, “the likelihood that
Americans will have sex-before
marriage has remained virtually
unchanged since the 1950s,” with
only one in 10 Americans bornin
the 1940s abstaining from sex'be-
fore marriage. The average age of
ﬁrst intercourse. — around 17 5-
has also been consistent over the
years. Between 1995 and 2007,.the

number of younger teens having
sex actually decreased by nearly
10 percent. 

Contrary to popular belief, teen
sex also isn’t necessarily becoming

more casual. Fifty-six percent of

adolescent boys and 70 percent
of girls report that their ﬁrst sex-
ual experiences take place within’
steady relationships.

Teen pregnancy "rates have”
steadily declined since the ’90s,
dropping 42 percent since 1990

and hitting recordlows in 2008.

Most of this can be -attributed to
increased contraception use, but a
"small fraction reﬂects a decrease in
adolescent sexual activity overall.
Further, two-thirds of those teen
pregnancies occur among 18 and
19 year olds. Teens have been hav-
ing fewer and fewer babies since

the 19305, and the teen abortion ‘

rate has dropped, as well.
So whatever the Victoria’s Se-

cret move signiﬁes, it’s not cause‘

for yet another teen sex panic.
Additionally, the Victoria’s Se-
cret tween line does not mean that
middle school girls will — all of a
sudden — be wearing racy under-
wear. Many of the young girls who
will shop the new line were already

wearing racy underwear, no doubt some of it

from Victoria’s Secret; after all, people don’t
exclusively buy things that are marketed to

A them directly, and of no demographic is that

more true than girls who want to seem older
than they are. v f
It-also doesn’t mean that any of these

girls are doomed. Girls with ‘whom I went

tently purchased and wore a red string bikini

venture that I also turned out OK.
That young teens and preteens want to

feel grown—up and expe_riment with sex and
sexiness is less a symptom of a sick society
than a developmental fact. That intimates
stores would want to corner that eager mar-

ket is perhaps an inevitability of capitalism. - -

But one thing’s for sure: The urge to control,
condemn and punish young people —.— es-
pecially young women — for wanting to be
grown-up and sexy has failed, thus far, to
produce the desired result of adults with
healthy sexual expectations and boundaries.

_f That is not to say that the idea of a line of
Victoria’s Secret lingerie geared toward pre-

‘ teens doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable.

It does. It totally squicks me out because I
don’t think a girl that young necessarily has
the emotional maturity to handle the atten-
tion, wanted or unwanted, that she might get

if she chooses to ﬂaunt her sexuality in that
way. But being squicked out is not a basis
for rational decision-making, and it is not a
good place from which to advocate.
Certainly, there is some hypocrisy evident
in the notion that the colorful briefs that we
will not tolerate on a 14-year-old American
girl are acceptable for the 14-year-old Ukra-

nian girl who modeled them in the fashion '

show. e and made less than minimum wage
when all of her hours were totaled. If we
reallylhad an objection to young girls being
'exploited;in skimpy outﬁts, we would boycott

_ the entire fashion industry, not just a single
; line.of-underwear. But the dialogue around

the issue suggests that we are not invested in
preventing the exploitation of young girls as
much as we are angry about being forced to

confront the idea of our pubescent daughters
growing into sexual beings. ° ‘
Moral panics like the.Victoria’s Secret
crisis allow us to take the outraged high
ground without doing any of the cultural
heavy lifting that actually beneﬁts our kids. ‘ll
As a parent, it’s your prerogative to forbid
your middle—schooler from wearing lacy un-
derwear, but don’t think for a minute that’s
going to stop her from having sex — and

' don’t think, if you won’t talk to her about
safe sex or boundaries, that when the time.

comes she’s going to be any better prepared
to makehealthy sexual decisions than her
thong—wearing peers. I

SOFTBALL

The Pitt softball team faced a challenge
entering the new campaign: It needed to
ﬁnd a way to replace the ﬁve starters that
graduated after last season.

The Panthers welcomed nine newcom-
ers to ﬁll the void left by the departing
senior class,'and one freshman in particu-
lar has performed spectacularly for head
coach Holly Aprile’s team this season.

’ Tori Nirschl, who hails from Carlsbad,
Calif., has already proved herself to be a

‘ huge addition to the Pitt softball program.

-~ Through 26 games, the left ﬁelder

currently leads the team with a batting
average of .354, a slugging percentage of

.732, an on-base percentage of .449 and_

seven home runs.

After dropping its Big East opener to
St.John’s at home last weekend, Pitt (13-
13, 2-1 Big East) trailed the Red Storm

' 2-0 late in the second game of Saturday’s
doubleheader, facing a disappointing 0-2

start to conference play.

SPORTS    
 Freshman outﬁelder Nirschl begins Pitt career with a bang

But then Nirschl stepped up to the
plate for the Panthers in a huge way, both
literally and ﬁguratively. ' '

Her seventh home run of the season
cut the St. John’s lead in half in the sixth
inning, sparking a late Pitt rally that cul-
minated in a 3-2 extra-innings walk-off
win. . .

When asked what the most important
play of the game was, Coach Aprile said:
“Tori Nirschl’s home run to get us going
and get us within one run. She also had a
good at bat in the last inning, too.” ‘

Nirschl agreed, saying the momentum‘

of the game changed after herhome run.
“I think I did a pretty good job of

sparking us a little bit,” she said."‘We .'

did a better job of taking advantage of
our opportunities.”

Nirschl’s spark carried over for the
Panthers into the series rubber match
on Sunday, as the freshman outﬁelder
reached base in three of her four plate
appearances, scoring one run and driv-

Dixon should change style to

Jeremy Tepper
Stq/ff‘ Writer

There’s no harder sports team to be a fan
of than Pitt. Sorry, you can’t tell me oth-
erwise. ’ '

While some teams deal in extremes, ei-

“ ' ther consistently successful or consistently

awful, Pitt’s two primary sports programs
— football and basketball — are in a sort
of limbo: They’ll often give you hope, but
never break through. _

This is especially the case with the

{a men’s basketball team. There’s no doubt

that head coach Jamie Dixon’s team has
had tremendous regular—season success,
frequently ﬁnishing near the top of the
conference standings and making nine of
the last 10 NCAA tournaments. But those
quality regular seasons only make the dis-
appointing postseasons more painful.
Despite consistently entering the NCAA
tournament with a high seed, Pitt has only
made it to two Sweet Sixteens and one Elite
Eight under Dixon.‘,That’s it. i
The question,-of course, is why?
5': .First, we have to ﬁgure out what a team
needs to make a long tournament run, but

there’s no exact formula on how to win A

multiple tournament games. Many people

will say you need exactly this or exactly
that, but there are always exceptions. My

. rule, in general,'is that a team needs to
be efficient defensively, to be efﬁcient _

offensively (or cause enough turnovers,
to generate more possessions to score)
and to have a go-to scorer. So far, Pitt has
had only one team that ﬁts these criteria:
the 2008-2009 team that featured Pitt
greats Dejuan Blair, Sam Young and ‘Lev-
ance Fields. As expected, that team ‘made
it the Elite Eight. _

Besides that, all other teams have suf-.
fered in one or two of those categories.

This year’s team was no different. Al-
though the team operated efficiently on
both ends of the court, it lacked a go-to
scorer. oftentimes, the offense would go
stagnant and no one stepped up. Although
Pitt’s offensive system changes slightly‘

' year to year, there is a constant: It’s pre-

dictable. When Pitt comes across a very
good defense, chances are the Panthers
will struggle. That’s where the go-to player

A comes in.-Pitt needs someone who can get

good shots consistently and make them or
generate multiple looks‘ for others when
the offense is reeling. .

Until Pitt ﬁnds another playmaker like

that and supports him with a more-than— V

avoid, earlytournament exits

capable offense and defense, they’re likely
not winning a championship, or even mak-
ing a Final Four.

So where does the program go from
here? '

For the ﬁrst time, I’m truly questioning
Coach Dixon, who received a lengthy ex-
tension this week. He’s an excellentcoach,

there’s no question. But I speak for many i

Pitt basketball fans in saying I yearn for

‘a championship. I’m tired of early tour-

nament exits. Before this past decade of
Pitt hoops success, which Dixon is largely
responsible for, most fans would have been
happy with reggular-season success, despite
the tournament failures. ’

Things are different now.

No longer is Pitt basketball a bottom-
feeder program. The Panthers boast a

consistent top—25 program. And top—25 I

programs expect to contend for champion-
ships every-year. l . 4

With coach Dixon’s recent extension,
he’ll now be Pitt’s coach for the next 10
years, which comes with a salary of ‘approx-
imately $1.6 million per season, Especially
with Pitt moving to the more offensive-
based- Atlantic Coast Conference, I hope
he slightly adapts his coaching style.

First and foremost, he needs to let his

players “just play.” They need to be loose
and have some more freedom and fun. If
they turn the ball over or take a bad shot,
Dixon can’t be there to give them a quick
hook. Additionally, a faster-paced offense

' would be nice. Pitt has some great ath-

letes that would thrive in such an offense,
namely 5.]. Moore and Durand Johnson-
Although it seems Pitt is at a bit of an
impasse, all is not wrong. Actually, things
are looking up —- at least for next season.
"The 2013-2014 Panthers will be head-
lined by sophomore center Steven Adams,
who I expect to be a bona ﬁde star after a
year of experience. Additionally, sopho-
more point guard James Robinson should

do an admirable job of handling the ball. I

On top of that, the team will feature lead-
ership in seniors Talib Zanna and Lamar
-Patterson — who should be above—average
starters —— and one of the best benches in
the conference. - ’
One thing’s missing though: A shooting
guard who can be that go-toscorer. Pitt’s

hope lies injohnson, who has the raw skills .

to ﬁll the role. 3 ,
Without that piece, Pitt fans will still
be in purgatory, questioning the future of

‘ the program. 3

she led Pitt with 105 total blocks and an
average of one block per set, while also post-
ing a team—best .265 hitting percentage‘.

Dittrich redshirted her freshman year at
Minnesota and will be one of Pitt’s senior
leaders next season, and she saw an oppor-

tunity to improve as a player and increase “

her knowledge of the game by attending the
national team tryouts.

“The tryout reminded me just how much
I love the sport of volleyball. All I did was
eat, ‘sleep and play with the best athletes
in the nation,” she said. “It was an amazing
experience.”

Alexa Campbell, a graduating Pitt outside
hitter, competed on USA Volleyball national
teams in high school and knows that Dit-
trich’s opportunity will only help her and
the Pitt squad grow as players. 3

“National team tryouts bring together
top coaches and players, and, in the process,
you are exposed to such diversity,” Campbell
said. “Even a fewdays in that environment
can open your eyes to different styles of play
that you can bring back and incorporate with
your own team.” A

Fellow senior Margy Acton agreed with .

Campbell and expressed herppride and en-
thusiasm for Dittrich’s chance at trying out
for a-national team. ‘ —

“I am very excited for Jasmine,” Acton
said. “She works hard and deserves a chance
to showwhat she can do against the best
players in the nation. I know she will beneﬁt‘
from the experience and, in turn, so will the
entire 2013 Pitt team.” V

In Colorado, 57 middle blockers were
competing for a limited number of spots on
the national team. In early March,,Dittrich
received notice from USA Volleyball about
her status. 4

“I heard back from the tryout committee
that out ofthe 57 players at my position, I
ﬁnished at No. 11,” Dittrich said. “This means
I missed makingthe team by 3 spots. It is both »
upsetting to miss the mark by so little, but it
is also a great honor to receive that r"anking.”

Such a ﬁnish is indeed an impressive ac-
complishment for someone who picked up
the sport in high school while also competing
in track and leading her basketball team to v
the Minnesota state tournament. ‘.

ited the entire team for earning the two
important wins, despite her invaluable
contributions.

“Everyone did a really great job,” she
said.

This weekend wasn’t the first time this
season Nirschl helped the Panthers earn
crucial victories.

Leading her team to four wins in ﬁve
games at the ESPN Citrus Classic tour-
nament in Kissimmee, Fla., earlier this
month, the freshman scored nine runs
and hit a triple and a home run. For.her
efforts, Nirschl ‘received her first career

The freshman is almost halfway to
breaking the school’s single—season home
run record of 15 held by Jackie Haar in

DITTRICH

“I started playing volleyball my freshman
year in high school, and I fell in love with the
sport as soon as I began,” Dittrich said.

Most volleyball players that go on.to play
at the collegiate and professional level par-
ticipate in club volleyball in the high school
off—season. However, Dittrich was busy with
other athletic endeavors and did not play
for a club team.’Despite this, Dittrich’s tal—
ent and passion for the sport earned her a
spot on the Minnesota team  eventually
the Pitt squad.

Dittrich attributes much of her success
to her family members, who have been sup-
‘ portive of her decisions and attend as many

matches aspossible.

“I? am blessed to have an amazing sup-
port system,” Dittrich said. “My parents and
family have inﬂuenced me throughbut my
career and I am so grateful for all they have
done. Even while living all the way in Min-
nesota, my parents were able to make 22 of

my matches. They are truly amazing.”

Last season, Dittrich and the Panthers
compiled a 17-14 record and qualiﬁed for
the Big East tournament for the ﬁfth year
in a. row. Now; looking forward to her ﬁnal
year at Pitt, Dittrich understands that the Pitt
team will be different for several reasons.

“Our team is in a transition stage,” Dit-
trichqsaid. “We have a new head coach, Dan
Fisher, and we are moving to the ACC. We,
have a lot to prove, and I have high expecta-
tions for our team and our ability to have a
successful season.” V »

A new head coach can mean a new system
and style oﬂplay, but Dittrich is conﬁdent
that such a change will be welcomed by the
Panthers and used to their advantage in a
competitive conference.

“We are all very excited to be working
together with a new coach and expect great
things to come,” Dittrich said. “We all need
to buy in and have the willingness and ability
to adapt to changes quickly. We must trust

. the systems ‘implemented and work within

them.” . A

‘ Dittrich has high hopes for the 2013 Pitt
season, but also has expectations for her
ﬁiture in volleyball. Despite narrowly missing
a spot on the national team this year, Dittrich
looks forward to remaining involved with
volleyball even after graduation.

' “Whether it is coaching or playing over-
seas, I deﬁnitely plan to be around volleyball
in the future,” Dittrich said. “Life is ﬁlled with
opportunities. I never would have guessed
that I would have left home in Minnesota to
attend a school 14 hours away, but now I am
