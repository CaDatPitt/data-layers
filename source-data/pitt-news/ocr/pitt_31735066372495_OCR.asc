Fine Arts Building on the Pitt

1.

Tokar Lecture

Franklin Toker, internation-
ally recognized architectural
historian, will ' discuss the
results of excavations that have .
revealed an obscure sculptor as
one of the greatest architects of
medieval Europe.

The lecture, “The Church
Historians Forgot: Excavations
Below the‘ Cathedral of Flor-
ence,"‘wil-l be at 4 p.m., Jan 21
in the auditorium of the Fpick

campus. .-
’' T oker, associate professor of
fine arts at Pitt, has established
for [he first time the identity of
the architect who designed the
Cathedral of Florence begun in /
1296, but not completed until
I436. Generally cotisidered the
first great expression of the Ital-
ian Renaissance, the cathedral,
according to Toker, is in fact
Gothic in concept and was con-
ceived by Arnolfo di Cambio.‘
Until now, historians
believed that the catliedral had
been conceived by a committee
of 24 architects in I367. Toker’s
finds reveal the structure as the
last great utterance of the
Gothic impulse and not the
beginning of the Renaissaiice.
“For art historians,” wrote the
New York 'I’imes, “his asser-
tions amount to dropping a
brick into a placid pond."
The lecture, one in a series of
Phi Beta Kappa lectures, is co-
sponsored by the Center for
Medieval and Renaissance
Studies. The lecture is open to
the public.

Fine Arts building.

The program, co-sponsored‘
by Pitt’s Music Department and
the Music Performance Trust
Fund, is free and open to the

ublic. For more information.

Pitt Fa-cuItyGroupsVote To Merge 

By FREDERICK BEERS

Pitt faculty~is one step closer to

' unioiiizing, because two faculty

unions have voted to form a single
representative bargaining
organization.

Memebers of Pitt’s chapter of the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors (AAUP) voted 46-38
to join with the Pitt Professional
Union (PPU) in forming the new
organization, which will be called
United Faculty. The PPU, an affil-
iate of the American Federation of
Teachers, voted 55-0 in favor of the
merger. I

If approved, United~Faculty. will
seek to represent the approxi-
mately I300 faculty members in the
Provost’s Area, which includes the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the

A regional

campuses, the depart-
ments of engineering, education,
and social work, and the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs.

The schools of law, medicine,
nursing,
related professions will --not be
represented by the new union-

English professor Philip Wion,
who heads the PPU, said the“deci-
sions are a “very important step

' toward unity for.the faculty,” and

that the PPU worked hard for the
merger. He is “very pleased with
the directions things ‘are taking."
Wion said United Faculty will

peting voices" in their labor
relations. ' '

“strengthens the position of the
faculty and the faculty’s role of

’ governance here” W ion added.

, Economics professor Richard
Thorn, president of the AAUP
chapter here, is not as optimistic as
Wion. He said he believes the
faculty is still “undecided.” _

"The faculty is satisfied with the
present circumstance‘ and they
don't know whether the union
route is the appropriate route to
go,” Thorn said.

Thorn agreed that enabling the
faculty to speak with a single voice
is a clear advantage of the merger.

“The faculty’s diversity of opin-
ion," Thorn said, “is interpreted as

a faculty not being able to make up '

its mind.” . M *

Todd DeLuca was sworn in
as president of the 1982 Student
Government Board last night in
a ceremony at,Soldiers and Sail-

Outgoing president Bill

administered the oath to the
eight new board members:
Spencer Davis, Jeff Delmon-

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

It's not unusual for a newly

elected president to express optim- , A

ism about his coming term in.

office. By the time’ he takes his oath,
he has setihis goals and is prepared
to fulfill the campaign promises
that secured his election.

Newly
Government President Todd De-
Luca is no exception. He, like oth-
ers before him, expressed optimism
and enthusiasm about his coming
year as one of Pitt"s student leaders.

DeLuca said he expects this year
to be filled ‘with many diverse
issues important to the student and

the university alike. ‘Some of these

issues include fraternity housing,
the Schenely Hall renovations and,
most importantly,‘ according to
DeLuca, teacher evaluations.

One of DeLuca’s campaign
planks was the issue of mandatory
teacher evaluations. He believes

they are necessary for Pitt students, S

the university and the instructors
themselves. DeLuca said he wants

While outgoing president Bill
Abraham was cleaning out his desk
and packing his papers away, De-

L_uca spoke of ‘his responsibilities’

as SGB president.

“I am the official spokesperson.

of the students and it is my respon-

sibility to do the best that I can -

during my term of office,” he said.‘
He added that students often do
not realize the effect that the stu-

dent government has.oii the stu- .

dent population. While he admits
that SGB has no legislative power,
he stressed that it is the recognized
voice of the students and that the
university listens to what it‘ has to

EQIIRUM

TA/TF Appointment Procedures

By PEGGY FERRI

Each year Pitt graduate students
who qualify compete for teaching
assistantships that benefit the
teaching assistant (TA) by provid-
ing ‘him with financial aid and
experience in teaching. The uni-
versity benefits "because classes are
taught at a reduced cost. Duration
of the appointment is usually for
two terms unless otherwise indi-
cated and the termination of an
appointment is rare.

In this “Forum,” The Pitt News
looks at university's policy con-
cerning TA appointments and the
case of a former speech department
TA, Jonathan Gallup, whose reap-
pointment was denied.

Dr.I Jack Matthews
Speech

Department
Chainnan   I

“Technically, each department
chairman has the /responsibility of
recommending to the dean- the
appointment of a TA. It is unusual
for the dean not to follow such

- recommendations. After the stu-

dencaccepts in writing the
appointment, it is considered a

a contract between the student and

the university. The TA also

receives a standard salary.
“Reappointment is not guaran-

teed and termination is infrequent._

n In the event a TA fails to live up to

the expectations of an appoint-
ment, an‘ attemptis first made to

I correct the problem.)

“If a complaint of ineffective
teaching comes in, there is no
assumption that tht;_compIaint is
justified, but a consistent pattern of
complaints usually resultsin talk-

ing the matter over with the TA
and/or the parties involved, which,
again seldom comes up. The policy
is that of encouraging the student
and the TA to work it out among
themselves or with a supervisor.”

Herbert Rubin
Assistant FAS
Dean

"Each different department is
responsible for the orientation and
training of their TA in teaching. In
addition, each department is
expected to evaluate the perfor-
mance of that TA.

“The contract that a TA signs
when he agrees to the duties of his

‘appointment is legally binding.

The termination of the appoint-
ment is preceeded by a written
warning with respect to his perfor-
mance. Termination can also be
initiated if the TA has violated one
or more of the canons of responsi-

bility, such as coming to class»

unprepared.

“Gallup’s appointmentwas not
terminated‘; his reappointment was
denied. There is an appeals proce-
dure before an appointed appeals

committee. Gallup had the right to ‘V

appeal and did appeal, and was
turned down. Each appointment is
for no more than 12 months and
reappointment is not guaranteed.
\“One factor to be aware of is also
that with all the cutbacks in fund-
ing, there are cutbacks in the
appointments and the number of
spots available. When a person is

not reappointed, it would have.

nothing to do with the individual
personally". ‘ . I

 

Jonathan Gallup

Former Teaching
Assistant

“Even though I lost the appeal,‘

it was an educational experience.
In other words, if you are any good
at teaching college—don’t go to
Pitt; they want someone to read

I canned lectures and to play the.

game. 

“I’ve attended the university for

over seven years, finished require-
ments for a master's and started a
Ph.D. in the speech department.
.To get financial aid, I agreed to
assist teaching a public speaking
course and a class in mass
communications.

“I was notified and only had one
month to prepare for the commun-
ications class. I taught the class, I
think, as.a group of adults and
explained to the students that I had
done some research and that I
couldn’t give canned Iectures—-
pre-prepareed lectures that had
been offered to me so I would
appear better prepared. I said that
we would participate in our own
education instead of me telling
them that they were the empty-
héaded onesand that I would fun-
nel what they needed to them. The
students enjoyed the class.

“Around midterms, a student
‘showed up and wanted to take a
test. Up until then, the other stu-
dents had put a lot of work into
various projects instead of a test. I
didn't think that it was fair to let
this student take a test when the
others -had put so much time into
their work. I told the student to
read the book and make up a test.

“The student complained to the
advising center, which called a

 

faculty member. I later filed a com-
plaint against that faculty member
because he had tried to convince me
to give the student a good grade
and I thought that was unfair.
“When my financial aid was

' reviewed last April, I was charged

with not having my classes evalu-
ated and not having my syllabus on
file. I appealed it, and-the evidence
that Idid both of these things over-
turned everything.

“The «reason I was dismissed

...was that by pressing charges

against a faculty member..,,l had_

committed a breach of professional
ethics. .

“I have been told that reappoint-
ments in the speech department
aren’t usually turned down..

“It’s kind of ironic that the
department still paid for that full
academic year, even the summer.
But now I’m not in school because
the money ran out. I’ll be back
whe Icn afford it. '

DeLuca Looks Forward To Productive Year

continuedfrom page one

DeLuca stated that the fact that
he and the other eight board
members were elected is evidence
that their views must have had
some effect on the student body.

“We know from the campaign
that. what we spoke about must be
what the students want,” DeLuca
said.

Deluca said he wants to main-
tain a democratic relationship with
the board. He said he does not want
to have any control over any one
issue or any board member. His
job, he said, is to facilitate the
actions of the board.

“I want to initiate a working,
professional attitude with the
board from the very start,” he said.

On the night of the election tally,
several candidates who are now
board members grumbled about
their future co—workers. Most of the
complaints dealt with personality
clashes rather than professional
criticism. DeLuca said that under
his administration, personality
problems will not be tolerated if

"It's my responsibility to clear
the board of personality clashes,"
he said. “I’m going to facilitate a
professional—type attitude, not a
personality one."

He said that if there are problems
with personalitites, it is his job to
step in and eliminate the problem.

“We have to remember ourjob is
to work for the good of our stu-
dents," DeLuca said.

DeLuca was also positive about
having the ex-president of the Resi-
dent Student Association (RSA),
Robbie The’, and the former chair-
woman of the Commuter Affairs
Committee, Linda Hausman, on
the same board. .

“It is crucial that they work

.together for the board,” he said.

He said that Hausman will play
a key role in getting the commuters
involved in student affairs since she
is aware of their needs and wants.

DeLuca noted that although the
interests of residents and commu-
ters are different, Hausman and
The’ can combine those interests
for the good of both groups.

DeLuca said he does not think
that Pitt is a “commuter school."

iHe said it is also a resident’s school.

“Most schools don't even have
4,200 students let alone 4,200 resi-
dents," he said.

DeLuca added that‘ the new
board is “packed with quality peo-
pie" with many different ideas anti
interests. He said this diversity will
enable the board to start new,
across-the—board projects. H6‘ Said
there should be no limitations on
what the board will handle this
year.

DeLuca believes that because he
was a board member for a year, he
can better understand what the
needs of a board member might be.
He also said he was going to try to
convey his needs to the board.

“I’m not going to alienate myself
from the board," he said. “I think
the transition (from board member
to president) should be quite easy.”
quite easy.”

DeLuca said he expects the board
members to start setting their goals
immediately. He pointed out that
most of the goals may not be
accomplished in the course of the
year, but that is to be expected. 9

“If we can make the goals we set,
that’s good,” he said. “If not, at
least we set the groundwork for the
next board.”

United
Efforts

_ Half the battle for collective bargainin
, rofessors an
instructors this week as tie announced
results of D_ecember’s merger election
ensured a unified effort between the Pitt
Professional Union ‘and the American
Association of University Professors.
Attempts at unionizirig for collective bar-
gaining are always delicate subjects in the
educational field. We have become increas-
ingly aware_ of the growth of power in
teachers’ unions as more and more high
school teachers walk the picket line each
fall. But_ unlike -strikes by trade or construc-
tion unions, these walkouts usually erupt
into long, drawn-out volatile situations.-
Fortunately, our co‘ leges and universities
have been_ enerally s ared the ravages of
teacher stri es an_d.col ective bargaing bat-
tles. And the decision by P_itt professors to
]OlI1 in a unified effort signals astrong
intention of the faculty to seek a contract
through direct and concerted negotiation.
_ The merger of the facult _ unions _lS
important or two reasons. irst, it will
solve the intern_al stri_fe inherent when two
unions _‘prof_fertng different philosophies
coexist in a similar environment. bservers
of labor relations in the secondary schools
constantly see this conflict between the
American Federation of eachers, which is

affiliated with the AF L-CIO, and the Amer— _

ican Education Association

As an,AFL—CIO affiliate, the AFT rim- E

arily aligns itself with_ hilosophieso blue-
collar unionism whi e the _
follows the tr_ends of_ white.-collar,
professionally-oriented unions. Thes_e div-
isive philosophies sometimes derail the
common goals _sought_ by teacherunions in
negotiations with their school districts.

ut Richard Thorn, an economics pro-

. fes_sor who heads the Pitt AAUP chapter,

said this merger will .“,gr_eatly improve the
strerith of the organization and ive it a
more_rriod_erate, balanced approac 1.” '
Phil Wion an English rofessor who
heads the AFT-affiliated PU, said the
merger indicates a “very) good reason to
be-lieve that a large _num
are interested in voting for bargainirig.”
_ The second, andmost important reason,
is that the mer er prevents the obvious
spillover effect tiat intrafaculty disputing
would have_on the classroom si_tuation._The
primary mission of every university is to
provide quality'educatio_n—and such an
education cannot be provided when faculty

members are_ fighting among themselves

over bargaining rights and union
philosophies. - i
‘Barring _any unforeseen circumstances,
the executive boards of both Pitt unions
will approve th_e merger, and the new Unit-
ed Facultyi union W1 1 emerge to seek the

EA usually‘

er of th_e faculty r

rights to _negotiate the firstteacher contract '

1981: The Year In Review    

By LARRY LUNSFORD

A year ago we looked back on

A E980 in review and concluded that
t it had been a rather gloomy year.

Looking at _ 1981 in review, we
don’t see much apparent improve-
ment in the country and around the

a world; yet, the bad events basically

balanced with the good’.

The year started much on a high
note as the holding of the Ameri-
can hostages in Iran came to an end
after 444 days. The hostage crisis
had become a humiliating night-
mare forethis country, and ‘there
was jubilation at its end. The Iran-
ians added one further embarrass-
ment to the outgoing Carter

‘ administration as they released the

hostages’ on the day of President
_Reagan’s inauguration.

Reagan’s promises for prosper-
ity for the country have yet to pre-

vail, but most analysts admit thaf

the presiderit’s programs haven’t
yet had adequate time to work,
although he is losing supporters
faster than he is gaining them. Rea-
gan’s or another Republican’s
chances at maintaining residence
in the White House depend on the
success of what has been labeled
Reaganomics.

It was again a year oftragedies
and near-tragedies. Early ‘in’ the
year we were still mourning the
death of john Lennon when John
Hiiickley made an ‘attempt on Rea-
gan’s life. That was March 30. Less
than two months later, on May l3,
the attempt was made on Pope
john Paul II’s life. We are fairly
used ‘to our leaders being gunned
down by maniacs, but who would

liave thought someone would try to *

assassinate the pope? Yet, while
those two attempts failed, Egyp-
tian President Anwar Sadat was
fatally wounded by assassins last
October 6. It's all very scary, and as
we head iritol982_, we wonder who
will be next and how many are on
the list.

The year saw the deatlis of other
notables incliitling actors Ricliard
Boone, jiick .»\ll)ertson, William-
Holden, Natalie Wood and Melvyn
Douglas; singers Harry’ (Jliapin
and Bill Haley; boxer joe Louis;
journalist Lowell Tlioirias; Israeli
statesrnaii Moshe Dayan; and the
last reiiraining fiye—star geireral,

. ()tI1:tl‘ Bradley.

One of the top stories of the year
in this country was -the Sll('(‘(‘SSflll
l;tltt1('llll1g2ttl(llzttltlingtlffflflt’sp£t('(‘
sllttltlt' (loluinliia. lt was the first
time that a spirit‘ \'('l]l('l(‘ had been

inarice in space but at the same
time rt-iiewetl old questions about

‘ the valiie t)f'tll(' billions of dollars

spent on the space program while
our nation suffers with inflation in
a recession. '

One of the most frightening
moments of the year came when the
U.S. shot down Libyaniplanes in
the Persian Gulf. Much eofthe news
in 1981 focused on the growing
American conflict with Libyan
madman Moammar Khadafy, and
the conflict promises to dominate
the news again this year. --

Probably the top news of the year
came from Poland, climaxing with
the declaration of martial law in
December. When it appeared that
finally a dent was going to be made
in Russia's Iron Curtairi, the Pol-
ish leaders aiiclinilitary turned on
their own countrymen in defiance
of their cries for tleinocratfy. Lech
Walesa, Time magaIirie’s Man of
the Year, saw his dreams of free-
dorii for his coiintrytneii come to an
abrupt-end-—-not from direct Rus-
sian iriteryeritioii l)iit frorii the acts

In Peniisylvania, there was no
major event such as 'I‘l‘iree Mile
Island or the lottery fix as there had

.been the two previous years. Per-

haps the biggest story unfolded
near the end’ of the year and was
just corripletetl yesterday. That is
the l'.S. Steel takeover of Marathon

with

S anyone else.

Oil, which moved the Pittsburgh-
based steel giant higher in the list
of the nation’s largest corpor-

At Pitt, it again was a relatively
quiet year. One of the big news sto-

ries was the still-unresolved death

of Stonewall Stickfney, who fell or
leaped from the Cathedral last
October. The basketball Panthers
made it to the NCAA regionals and
won their first game before being
ousted by the national runner-up,

North Carolina. The football » in

Panthers had another ‘exciting sea-

son, holding on to the~No. 1 spot,

for three weeks‘(longer than any
other team last season) before their
final humiliating loss to Penn

State. “Iowever, they were vindi- _ .

cated by their impressive victory
over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl
and ended the season in the No. 2
position. _

These were the highlights of a
historical year. 1982 has begun
much tension—in Polant,
between the 11.8. and Russia, and

V at home with the economy. And it »

appears that efforts for some kind

- of handgun control in this country

will continue.

" Late lastyear, Joseph Albrightf

and Cox Newspapers ran a six-part
series, following extensive investi-
gation of the typeof weapon must
()f(’n used in murders, robberies,
muggings and rapes—as well as in
assassination attempts on Ameri-
can leaders. The series noted that
the guns ’were not the so-called Sat-
urday Night Specials, but rather
the short-range “snubbies." The
findings have ti‘igg'ered_new efforts
to resolve the gun control issue by

outlawing an instrument that is-
the first choice of criminals and off‘

Last year, Great Britain had
eight handgun deaths; Sweden, 21;
West ('.crniar1y,'l2; japan, 48; (Ian-
atla, 52; Israel, :38; and the United
States, 10,728. Surely something
has to he done, anti let us hope that
1982 will he the year to do it. We
hope this year will be a good one.

‘Sophomore Steve Beatty draws the starting assignment

Fast Start a

Hot Pitt ‘Faces Rutgers  

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Who would have believed that‘

after ten games. the young Pitt

‘ Panther basketball team would be

8-2, with victories over Tennessee
and Temple? Certainly not Pitt
Coach Roy Chipman.

When looking over his young,
talented, and raw squad before the
season, Chipman admitted that a
6-4 record going into tomorrow
night's Eastern Eight game against
Rutgers (7-3) at the Field House
would be nice.

Well, the Panthers’ 8-2 record is

beyond “nice,"‘ it’s downright‘

good! The team's been good when
it has mattered, too. Young teams,
who have not gone through the
rigors of a major college schedule
are expected to blow games at the

wire, and choke on their own inex-0
. perience. Not this team, notyso far.

With clutch last-second wins
over Tennessee and Temple, the
Panthers have risen to the occasion
when the game was on the line. It’s

a strange twist when you consider
that last year’s veteran team often

clutched defeat from the jaws of
victory. ; V m

Now, after an excellent ‘start,
Chip,man’s Panthers face the
toughest month of their schedule.
With no less than six league games

I-Iinson, the mostdominant center

in the league. At 6-9 Hinson is the

only center on a Rutgers roster that .
boasts butone senior. ’

Hinson embarrassed Pitt center
Steve Beatty last year‘in one game,
bfit» the then-freshman Panther
came back in Pitt’s opening-round
playoff game to redeem himself,
holding Hin-son in check.

Hinson may well be Rutgers’
chief troubleshooter but he’s by no
means their onlyone. Clarence ~
Tillman, a 6-7, 205 pound junior,
is the Scarlet‘ Knights’ leading
scorer. A good shooter, Tillman
was a high school All-American
from Philadelphia and originally
enrolled at Kentucky before

ently has found a home. As the top
returning scorer for Coach Tom

‘Young’s team, Tillman could he‘? .

the man to count on to open up
Pitt's l—3—l zone. It is a zone that has
not matched its success last year.
One explanation: A
“Players coming out of high

_school have to forget how "many

points they’ve scored, and concen-

I-trate on defense,” said Pitt Assis-
tant Coach Reggie Warford.

Although the Panthers have not
been on par defensively with last
year’s squad, they really don’t have
to be. While last year’s team, on
more than one occasion, was guilty
of repeatedly throwing up bricks
on the backboards, this year’s
Panthers have shown a better

shooting touclr. Led by leaditigm

scorer Clyde Vaughan, the Pan-
thers. have averaged close to 72
points per game while yielding 68
per game. V "

They will behard pressed to hit
those offensive figures against

_Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights are

the best defensive team in the

league, surrendering a measly 57.6--«~

points a game. Rutgers’ chief asset
is the same’ train Pitt relies on:
quickness. ' A

“They are very, very quick. And
they play a man—to-‘man defense,
basically. They are a very good
team,” Pitt’s Warford said. . ‘

Some of that. Rutgers quickness
will be missing however, as Rich

Brunson, Rutgers starting point _ 

guard, is out for the season. Brun-
son had to undergo surgery this
week for the removal of a cyst on
his lung. 0

Record-breaking
Efforts not Enough,
Michigan Nips Pitt

By JODY GIDLEY

Losing is always difficult to take.
But when you're on the road and
lose to your opponents by just a few
points, the impact of the loss is
sometimes harder to accept. An
example: the Pitt“ Lady Panther
swim team's narrow loss to the
University of Michigan, at Ann
Arbor.

Michigan, one of the strongest
swimming teams in the Midwest,
nipped the Lady Panthers 78-71,
over Christmas break. -

Before the meet, Pitt first-year

Coach Dave Belowich anticipated
‘a very close meet—anticipations
that proved to be half-accurate. He
had also expected the final score
would be in Pitt's favor.

“We knew it was going to be an

‘ extremely close meet and it was. In

 

some of the events, first and second
place was decided by 1/ 100th of a
second; and unfortunately we lost

a some of those close races," Belo-

wich said. »

Despite the loss, Belowich said
the team did swim very ‘well en
route to setting four school records
and four pool records.

Belowich hoped -the meet out-
come would be a good learning
experience for the team.

“For us the meet was frustrating,
yet sometimes you have to learn to
acceptlosing in order to appreciate
winning. iMichigan was a worthy
opponent for us and we were also a
worthy opponent for them, but a
deciding factor in the meet seemed
to be a lack of sharpness on our part
in certain areas," Belowich
reflected. “In a meet as close as this
one, you cannot afford to have any
letdowns. Unfortunately, we had a
few and Michigan was able to capi-
talize in those areas.”

Even though their efforts fell
slightly short of victory, there were
many bright spots for Pitt through-
out the meet.

Sophomore Sue Heon set a Pitt
record, a Michigan pool record and
qualified for nationals in the 1000-
yard freestyle with a time of
l0:06.87, then went on to accomp-
lish the same hat trick in the 400-
yard individual medley with a time
of 4:31.42. Heon also took first
place and set a pool record in the

The Pitt Panther wrestling
team, bolstered by some fine
individual performances in two
holiday tournaments, opened I
its dual meet season last night‘ at
Youngstown State.

The Panthers entered the
meet featuring a reshuffled
lineup, especiallyin the upper
weight classes, and two
wrestlers who are coming off
tournament championship
wins. .

Sophomore Joe Throckmor-
ton claimed the 126-pound title
at the prestigious Wilkes Open
Dec. 30 after roaring to a 4-0

A record in match competition. In

the final, Throckmorton
stormed to a 4-0 lead over
Bloomsburg’s Woody Fry
before an injury forced Fry to
default. The tournament,
according to Pitt assistant
coach Chuck Coryea, is gener-
ally considered. one of the top
two or three holiday meets in
the nation.

Pitt’s other tournament
winner was I42-pound senior
co-captain Glen Nacion.
Nacion rolled to a 5-1 recordin
the double-elimination C.W.
Post tournament, with hisonlv
lossicoming to the wrestler he
later defeated in the -final.

While the iPitt lineup in
lower weight divisions, led

Senior Glenn Nacion, 142-pound champ at the recent C.W. Post tourney, is one at r
the early season’s stronger performers.

N ew-look Grapplers Face YSU

lately by Nacion and Throck-
morton, appears solid, Panther
coaches Rande Stottlemyer and
Coryea have done some jug-
gling with the top tiers of the
lineup due to injuries and lack
of depth.

The most notable change is
the team's heavyweight entry,
Jeff Wilps, who is making a
leap from his previous 177-
pound slot over three weight:
classes to wrestle in the top di-
vision. At 185 pounds, Wilps
will be at an almost certain
weight disadvantage against
most of his opponents,
although Coryea said Wilps has
the strength and quickness to
compensate against his larger
foes. ‘

“Jeff’s strength is one of his
biggest assets and he is quick
enough to handle iiiihrlllie ump
is also easier to handle than it
would be in the lower weight
classes. Most of your top-notch
heavyweights now are around
210-215 pounds. The trend is
getting away from the 265-
pound wrestlers,” Coryea said.
“We’re confident he can handle
it.”

The unavailability of several
wrestlers_ has depleted the
higher weight classes of the
Panther team. Dan Kasper-
'kowski is still recovering from a
knee operation he had over
Thanksgiving break, while the

coaches have decided to redshirt
190-pounder Kurt Karanovich,
who has also been hamperedby
a knee he reinjured in training.
Karanovich -will return next
year for his final year of
eligibility. V. y

In the 150-pound slot, Jeff
Gordon will get the start over
injury-plagued Mike Bond, an
NCAA tournament participant
last season, and two freshmen,
the surprising Rick Esswein at
118 pounds and Frank Vulcano
at 190.

The remainder of the Panther
lineup is: Craig Ritchey, 134
pounds; Jeff Jelic, 158 pounds;
Eric “Pepe” Harris, 167
pounds; and Frank Rick, I77
pounds.

The tournaments over the '
holiday, as well as the scrim-
mage with Clemson and several
spirited practices, have com-
bined to make Coryea optimis-
tic about the Panthers’
upcoming season in the tough
Eastern Wrestling League.

“We made a lot of progress
and gained a lot of knowledge
over the holidays. The team has
been looking the best it has been
in my three years as coach
here," Coryea said. “Wrestling-
wise and attitude—wise, we’ve
improved. The guys know they
can win this year‘. We’ve gained
a winning attitude."

And some new ‘hopeyfor the
new season. 9

Canadian style—certainly .pres-
ented nothing foreign, just
winning and more winning, en
route to a third-‘place finish at the
Third Annual Canadian Excalibur
Classic Jan 2-4 at York University.-

It was Pitt's first appearance in
the Classic. Panther outside hitter
Bill Knuth gained All-Star honors.

In the best-of-five game matches,
Pitt defeated three teams: West
Ontario 3-0, the University of
Toronto 3-1, and the University of
Waterloo 3-2.

The Panthers’ only losses were to
the University of York (2-3), which
is ranked No. 4 in Canada, and the
University of Alberta (2-3), the Col-
legiate National Champion of
Canada.

Coach Ray Reilly’s spikers were
honored as the only American team
invited to the six-team
invitational.

Canadian collegiate volleyball is
in the middle of its season while the
Panthers don’t start their regular
season until Jan. 31, when they
travel to meet defending Eastern
champion Penn State. Prior to the
Canadian trip, the Panthers had
one month of practices.

Reilly was impressed with his
team's early performance.

“We did quite well with one
month's practice,” said Reilly. “I
was pleased with what we did.”

Reilly was also pleased with per-
formances by several of his key
players——Knuth, the tournament
All-Star, Gene Larson, an outside
hitter and junior college transfer
from San Bernardino, California,
and setter Dave Baird, who made

Pitt Opens Season Hobbled, butHopefuI  

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

On a team where good health is the exception rather
than the rule and preseason training has wrought as much
harm as good, perhaps only enthusiasm remains unin-
jured as the Pitt Lady Panther gymnastics team limps into
'its season opener tomorrow against New Hampshire and
Temple.

The meet, which gets underway at 2 p.m. at Pitt's Trees
Hall, is the only home meet the Lady P-anthers enjoy in
this month’s five-match slate, not to mention a stiffinitial
test for the team, last year’s Eastern runner-up and the

While graduation was kind to the team, which returns
all but two gymnasts, injuries have not been. The Lady
Panthers’ leading performer, sophomore Lisa Shirk,
heads the long list of casualties with a bone spur in her
ankle wl'ii(‘l’i will be operated on Wednesday.

. Despite the injury, Shirk, the nation’s No.2-ranked all-

around performer last season, will still compete in tomor-
‘ row’s meet.

Following her surgery, she’s expected to be out for at
least three weeks, according to Pitt Coach Donna Sanft.

Also hobbled are Karen Martin, Gretchen Spiech and
Roxanne "Evans. All three are nursing sprained ankles.

Evans’ injury is a chronic one that will limit her tojust one

event—the parallel bars—in tomorrow’s meet. Martin,
who injured her ankle the day before the team’s Christmas
break,.has had her ankle in a cast at times to aid the

healing. _ .

And the list goes on: Babbie Flock, ai iunior all-
Laround performer, is suffering from mononucleosis and is
I but indefinitely; freshman Debbie Dabkowski has been

redshirted due to a knee injury she first sustained last
summer. Another freshman, Patti Vishnesky, left the team
after fall term to return home for “personal reasons,"

season tomorrow at Trees Hall.

according to Sanft. Sanft expects Vislmesky to return to
Pitt next fall. H

III addition to the injuries, the Pitt team will have to
overcome a New Hampshire team that trailed the Lady
Panthers by just two points at last season’s Eatern
Regional Championships. New Hampshire sports a
strong freshman class and a fine 135 score in its opening
meet. For both reasons, Sanft expects the visitors to be even

\

Kstronger this year. I

The Temple team’s strength depends on the six fresh-
men the Owls will start. Tomorrow will also be the open-
ing meet of their season.

“We’re starting off with a tough meet. New Hampshire
should be improved over last year. They scored I35 in their
first meet, which is good for this early in the season,” Sanft
said. “Plus, its hard to know what to expect in our first I
meet. Almost everybody will be throwing new routines, so
we have to see what the judges Wlll think.”

Because of her patchwork lineup, Sanft hedged at ven-
turing a target score or goals for the team in its initial

- showing. I he coach did say she expects the team’s scores
to improve noticeably in the balance beam event——a per-'
sistent weak spot in last season. Practice performances on
tghe [beam so far have been “encouraging,” according to
.. an t. 

With allthe physical ailments plaguing the team, such
encouragement has been rare for Sanft thus far. As she
admitted, “Sometimes you wonder why these things keep
happening to one team.” «

Sanft, who guided the team toa sparkling I 1-1 mark last
year that included a 10-meet win ‘streak, still remains
optimistic. “All the girls in the gym are working «really ‘‘
hard. It keps us going. All the people there are doing their
best, so what more can I ask for?”
