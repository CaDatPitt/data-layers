VOLUME XCVIH, NUMBER 130‘

Universi        
NPHC to expand

NIKKI SCHWAB
Senior Staff Writer

Is bigger really better? _

As part of the University’s move to
create new standards of excellence for
Pitt’s Greek community, the National

.Pan-Hellenic Council’s organizations ,

are being asked to get bigger or poten-
tially face losing recognition.

NPHC is the smallest of the three
Greek governance councils at Pitt,
comprised of seven historically, but not
exclusively, black fraternities and
sororities, with membership ranging
from two to 15 students in each of the
respective organizations,

However, Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Birney Harrigan

. explained that all student organizations

must have at least 10 members to be
recognized by the University.

“It is nothing exceptional here, we
are not making exceptions.” Harrigan
said, “We are being consistent.”

According to NPHC President Ron
Coursey, the University is urging these
Greek organizations to grow to at least
five members by the fall and possibly
lO‘members in the spring.

“Realistically I feel that it will be
Very hard for NPHC organizations to
maintain the number standards on a

semester to semester, year to year ' '

basis,” Coursey said. “I can honestly

see a couple of the chapters here fading »

out or dying out because of lack of
numbers.” . .
Coursey explained that it would be
“very rare” to find NPHC organizations
with “5O or 60 or. 70” members active
on the campus during one semester in
comparison to Interfratemity Council’s
organizations which average about 30
members. ‘
I “We have organizations that have

i 10 members already, and we have orga-

nizations that have three or four,’-’
Coursey said.

asks  

He added that his own fraternity,
Omega Psi Phi,’ Inc. had five members
with two graduating this spring.

According to Francine P. Young,
the NPHC eastern regional director,
each affiliated fraternity and sorority
imposes their own rules for member-
ship, rather than NPHC having certain
standards across the board. There are no
NPHC national minimum numbers for
membership, while there may be a min-
imum mandated in an individual frater-
nity or sorority.

“If [Pitt] put that kind of sanction,
they wouldn’t be able to operate,”
Young said.

However, Harrigan said that most
schools, in addition to national require-
ments, also impose institutional
requirements and that any new stan-
dards created would not conﬂict to
national regulations.

“If anything they will complement
the [national] standards,” Harrigan said.

No additional schools were able to
comment by press time. C

Young also explained that the exis-
tence of NPHC on a ’ campus often
encourages black students to come to
schools that have a predominantly
white student body and with member-
ship restrictions NPHC would not be
able to enlarge.

“I think [minimum numbers for
membership] would be a disadvantage
all the way around,” Young said. ,

Harrigan said that the Greek orga-
nizations contribute to the retention and
graduation rates by virtue of the work
they do.

NPHC organization’s fraternities and
sororities they can be more effective in
that regard,” she said. '

State colleges strike avoided  

‘ DANTE RENZULLI
Staff Writer

The Association of Pennsylvania
State College and University Faculties
thanked Governor Ed Rendell for his
intervention in the negotiation of a

four—year contract for faculty mem- -

bers. .

According to APSCUF President
and Pitt alumnus William E. Fulmer,
the likelihood of a faculty strike at the
14 Pennsylvania State System of
Higher Education schools this August
would have been great. had the gover-
nor’s office not stepped in to moderate.

Some of the terms being pursued
by the APSCUF include a co-pay of

health insurance premiums and
restricting excessive use of part—time
faculty.

Fulmer remarked that an

“unhealthy level” of tension had arisen
among students because of the uncer-
tain nature of the contract dispute.

“Seniors in their final semester

‘ have worried that they would not grad-

uate on time,” Fulmer said. “We, the
faculty, are committed to our students
and want them to know right now that
the spring semester will proceed on
schedule and" will finish on time.”

Talks between APSCUF and the
State System began in August 2002,
but came to a halt in December 2003.
Rendell then asked labor representa-
tive Ken Jarin to assist the two parties
in finding a common ground.

The APSCUF bargaining team
pledged to provide the Association
with a “fair and faithful” presentation
of the agreement. I

The outcome of this contract will

The Value of a higher  
education taught earlyon

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

For many seventh- and eighth-
graders, the prospect of going to col-
lege is less imposing than their
impending high school years. But for
many black middle-school students,
the idea of going on to —— and staying
in — college can be even more
daunting,

During a recent visit to the Pitt
campus, organized by Pitt’s African-
American Coalition for
Advancement, Achievement,
Success, and Excellence, 45 middle
school students got to explore the
possibility of higher education first-
hand and hear from those who have
come before them.

On Friday, March 5, the coalition
hosted students from the Frick
International Studies Academy for an
event titled, “What’s the Hype? The
Importance_ of Pursuing Higher
Education.”

The visiting students began the
day in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom with registration and the
singing of the Black National
Anthem -— “Lift Every Voice and
Sing,” by James Weldon Johnson —-
before hearing a summary of the
events of the day. Students moved on
to workshops and meetings with cur-
rent college students, where the
young visitors got a chance to gain
some insight into college life from
representatives of various Pitt orga-
nizations, and a tour of campus dor-
mitories.

 

each group would get.
The Pitt News regrets the errors.

In Monday’s Pitt News, it was incorrectly reported that the Student
Activities Fee is paid only by students in the School of Arts and Sciences. The
fee effects all non-College of General Studies students.

The amount of money received by each group affected by the proposed
increases was misreported. The following chart includes the corrected amount

According to Pitt sophomore
Frances Taggert, vice—president of
the coalition, members of her organi-

-zation have spent about four hours

on Fridays at Frick for the past year,
running academic programming,
workshops and field trips for stu-
dents there. She said the events of
the day were the result of trying to
“bridge the gap between the two dif-
ferent worlds of public school and
university,” as well as an attempt to
meet the requests of Frick students.
“A lot of them haven’t been
exposed to higher education, and
they always ask, ‘How’s college?
What’s it like?”’ she said. “So we
just said, ‘We’ll bring you over and
show you.”’ ‘
The value of an older person
showing interest and relating her
knowledge and experiences to a
younger person led Taggert and a
group of other Pitt freshmen to create
the coalition in January 2003. She
recalled that, when she came to Pitt,
she was surprisedthat upperclassman
didn’t reach out to her and instead
expected newcomers to join estab-
lished organizations where, she said,
they didn’t feel they had a voice.
“So, we felt, ‘Here we are. We
were leaders in high school, and we
feel like we can’t lead,”’ she said.
“So we came together and formed

our own organization, which is based '

on service.”
' “I’m from Pittsburgh and I’ma
graduate of ‘the public schools,” .she

Large class sizes addressed
in the recent negotiations

APSCUF, page 1

Haven, Mansfield, Millersville,
Shippensburg, Slippery Rock and West
Chester universities of Pennsylvania.
In a recent interview, Fulmer said
that negotiations are still in process. In

the event that an agreement cannot be

reached, teachers at the 14 State
System schools will go on strike.
Fulmer also conveyed his dis-

‘ agreement ‘ with the actions of State

System Chancellor Judy Hample.

“We have a- chancellor who is rela-
tively new to the system and has
worked to implement policies without
consulting the faculty,” he said.

One of the policies Fulmer men-

‘ tioned was the chancellor’s attempt to

limit full-time credit maximums to 16
as opposed to the current 18. This
means that students would have to pay
extra tuition if they wanted to take
more than 16 credits per semester.

Fulmer indicated in a press release
that Rendell shares the APSCUF’s con-
cerns about growing class sizes at State
System schools. ‘

“We. especially appreciate
Governor Rende11’s willingness to help
us seek class-size controls through
other Venues,” Fulmer added. “This is

an important academic quality issue
for both faculty members and stu-
dents.”

“I prefer to have less students in
my classes because it’ allows the pro-
fessor to give me personal attention,”
Kutztown sophomore Megan Coburn
said. “As far as I know, class sizes
aren’t really an issue at my school. I
don’t take any courses that I would
describe as overcrowded.”

Justin Veisz, ad
Millersville, also did not see a problem
with current class-size controls.

“I’ve been lucky, most of my
teachers are Very against the strike,” he
said. “None of them are really unsatis-
ﬁed with their arrangement  The

_ teachers were supposed to go on strike

over the winter break, but then that
didn’t end up happening.”
-There are still several steps left in

A the approval process. APSCUF mem-

bership has yet to officially consent to
the terms set forth by the State
Executive Council. They are tentative-
ly looking to -ratify in two to three

' weeks. ‘ _
If all goes as plarmed, the 5,500 ‘

faculty members at the 14 state-owned,
universities would get their final

answer before the next academic year. .

added. “I went through. a system
where they don’t really force, or

enforce, higher education on the stu-

dents. That’s why our organization
was founded —— so we can give back
to the students who go through the
system we came out of.”

Rose Afriyie, director of pro-
gramming for the coalition, said this
visit was the first in—depth experi-

.ence with Pitt for many of the Frick

students, who usually view it from
their classrooms across Fifth Avenue.

“They were really excited to see
the rooms, and see where we eat, and
how we live, and what exactly it
takes to be an everyday college stu-
dent,” she said. “They were really
happy to actually get a glimpse into
this world, instead of just being on
the outskirts of it.” ’

It_’s this excitement about being
accepted to and attending a universi-

ty — and staying to complete a
degree — that has been shown to be‘

statistically deficient among black
students.

According to The Journal of
Blacks in Higher Education, which

College admittance harder now

in each issue collects statistics bear-
ing on the relative status of black and
white Americans, it has become more
difficult for black students to gain
admittance to higher education in
recent decades.

The winter 2002/2003 issue of
the journal quoted ‘findings from a
Trends in College Admissions 2000
survey, which found that While the
average number of applications
received by state-chartered, four-
year universities in the United States
fromblack students, between 1985
and 1999, had risen from 396 to 870,
_the percentage of black applicants
who were accepted ,for admission
over that_ same period had fallen
from 65 percent to 47 percent, and
that those who were accepted and
enrolled also fell from 59 percent to
37 percent. 1

That study also found that the
percentage of black people among all
first-time enrolled students at state-
chartered, four-year universities over
that period had fallen slightly, from
8.7 percent to 8.4 percent.

In addition, the summer 2002

make the organizations “more vibrant”

' and “more effective.” Having a mem-

bership of at least 10 is “a statement
that your _organization is working,”
Harrigan said.

Harrigan acknowledged that the
University has already talked to NPHC
about the new standards and is working
with them closely.

“We’ve asked them to submit
recruitment plans,” Harrigan said.

Coursey said that these new
requirements were unfair and unrealis-
tic because NPHC organizations face
different obstacles than those of the
IFC and the Pan—Hellenic Association.

Some of the obstacles include the
basic fact that NPHC is a minority
organization ‘and the minority retention
rate “is not very high at all,” according
to Coursey._ ‘

Also, a potential member must

“have already completed a certain man-

dated amount of college credits before
they can join one of the fraternities or

sororities as well a nationally mandated V
grade point average.

“You basicallyhave to be a sopho-
more in standing,” Coursey said, “It
prevents underclassmen from getting

focused on other things besides acade-

micsand also allows college students
to shop and explore the different orga-
nizations to see which one best they
fit.” ,

_One of the largest obstacles facing
NPHC right _ now, according to
Coursey, is the amount of money it
costs to join any of the organizations.
The dues range from about $800 to
$1,000 and have to be paid up front.

' While the dues are good for three years,

potential members may not have that

‘kind of money lying around to join a

Greek organization.

‘ Brothers of IFC organizations pay,
 their dues once a semester to IFC and

their nationals, and while the overall
costs may in the end be larger, NPHC
requires potential new members to pay
for their college career of membership
in whole.

“NPHC, although we may be lack-
ing in numbers, we have gone far and
beyond as far as service is concerned in
the university community,” Coursey
said.

Harrigan said that the NPHC orga-

nizations had to try to get their mem- A

bership up, but was unsure what route
the University would take if they are
not able to do so. ‘

“I haven’t decided what is going to
happen,” Harrigan said.

To help quantify what they could
do to get through college, each Frick
student received a “quick list” of
social, academic and professional
suggestions for things to try to
accomplish each school year from

Black Greek system may be in peril

By way of an incredibly wrong-
headed piece of reasoning, Pitt is con-
sidering placing a possiblyfatal onus
on the National Pan-Hellenic Council,
the governing body of Pitt’s black

’ Greek system.

At Pitt, student organizations
must have 10 members to be recog-
nized by the University. Pitt wants to
extend this requirement to the NPHC,
mandating that the historically black
fraternities and sororities on campus
must each have 10 members to keep
their recognition by the University.
This is a move that would be terrible
for black Greeks and the entire Pitt
community.

A minimum membership require-
ment is a fair distinction for the
Underwater Basket Weaving Club. It
is not a fair distinction for black fra-
ternities and sororities, which have
traditionally been exceedingly selec-
tive in choosing their membership,
and have a much smaller base to draw
from. _

Forcing black fraternities and
sororities to recruit more aggressively
— which they have been asked to do
— and accept more members will
serve only to cheapen the arduous and
tradition-heavy process of pledging
and membership. Some of Pitt’s old-
est organizations are black fraterni-
ties.

Bimey Harrigan,. associate dean
of Student Affairs, says that the move
is, among other things, motivated by a
desire to make the " fraternities and
sororities more “vibrant” and‘ “effec-
tive.” She says that increasing their
numbers will make them more effec-
tive, and can contribute to black
retention‘ and graduation rates.

But this is faulty logic.
Threatening small organizations
won’t make them more vibrant; it will
make them nonexistent. Given Pitt’s
dismal race-relations record, elimi-
nating black fraternities and sororities
is an even worse idea.

Public relations and lowered stan-
dards aside, it is completely unrealis-
tic to place the burden of recruitment

on individual" campus chapters — in.

the NPHC, membership decisions are
made at the national level. Therefore,
if a given fraternity or sorority chap-
ter in California is having a problem
and the national chapter decides to
put A a temporary moratorium on

accepting new members, a chapter at

Pitt could lose their recognition.

It isn’t up to the University to put
strictures on the black Greek system.
The system is small and private, and
has a right to remain so, with minimal

intervention. Unilateral action based.

on one person’s idea of fairness and
consistency is. not acceptable.

Photographs record and shape inemories

I recently had the opportunity to par-
ticipate in an alternative spring break
program, working for Habitat for

Humanity in Hawaii. Nobility of the‘

cause aside, I wouldn’t have been too
interested if we had been building hous-
es in Ohio. We still had plenty of time to
participate in the conventional vacation

experience. I gained a lot from the trip, O

most notably the experience of living
and working in the closest A

proximity imaginable with '
nine complete strangers,

memories. Yet as I reﬂect on
the trip, my most vivid mem-
ory is that of pulling my carn-
era out.

I used three rolls of ﬁlm

as a photograph? ‘

When I was younger, I would
always wince with armoyance at how
my dad invariably insisted on taking

endless pictures at not just every- family 

function or holiday, but even during
mundane moments on a daily basis. I
thought he should focus on living in the
present, rather than preserving it. Wasn’t
he wasting his time by
meticulously arranging pic-
tures in chronological order

It’s only now that I’ve
left most of“ the ‘familiar
faces oft-my life, that I
understand my father’s
thinking. It’s now I that am
armoying my roommates‘
with my incessant snapping

what scenery and group
arrangements were worthy of
documentation, I .subcon— _
sciously tried to create a version of the
trip that hadn’t really happened, captur-
ing only the images that would foster 
of the positive things I wanted to
remember — none of theebad times. As
the Robin Williams character in “One
Hour Photo” observes, “nobody takes
pictures of something they want to»—for-
get.” . ‘
My worst nights of the semester,
when I would come back to my room
after a failed test or doing badly in a soc-
cer game, I would find comfort in the
friendly prom and graduation pictures
lining my wall, longing for those happy
times when all wasright with the world.
Of course,.I never took a picture of all
those days of complete embarrassment
and teen angst that dominated the major-
ity of everyone’s high school experi-
ence. Is this practice of selective remem-
brance deluding? Is it foolish to believe
we could hold on to parts of our lives

of pictures at the most
seemingly trivial
moments. I now see that
even those moments are ones. I am going
to treasure eventually. As I begin to for-

_ get the last names (and first) of my casu-

al friends from junior high and am no
longer able to recall if I vacationed at
Rehoboth or Dewey Beach when I was
12, I want to ensure that I never forget
the things that truly matter to me.

My attempts might be as futile as
Jim Carrey’s desperate run through his
quickly disappearing memories in
“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind,” but I think we owe it to those
beautiful moments of our lives to resolve
to never let them fade away, whether it
takes a photograph or diary or conversa-
tion with an old friend to do so.

My friends often chastise me for
being “stuck in high school,” in terms of
my mindset and the fact that I can’t let
myself completely let go of my feelings

Misplaced military focus

In 2003, 1 .2 billion people lived on less
than $1 per day. Half or more of the popu-
lation in the 49 least—developed countries
are estimated to live at that
absolute poverty line. Another
2.8 billion lived on less than
$2.

That United Nations list
of 49 poorest nations in the
world runs like a who’s who
of the most unstable countries
in the world: Afghanistan,
Burundi, Central African
Republic, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Haiti,
Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra
Leone, Somalia, Sudan — on
and on it goes. Not surprising-
ly, and virtually without exception, these
countries have also witnessed tremendous
violations of human rights and the targeting
of civilians in military action.

In Israel and Palestine, the most visible
of the ﬁghts against terror continues. Over
3 million Palestinians are refugees without
a state. The West Bank is divided into
roughly 300 enclaves by Israeli check-
points, settlements and roadblocks.
Seventy—ﬁve percent of Palestinians live on
less than $2 a day and unemployment runs
well over 50 percent. '

The tie between poverty and violence
is not a coincidence.

What is interest, however, is that a
study of the 21 richest countries and their
commitment to the development of poor
countries ranked the United States 20th out
of those nations, ahead of only Japan. The
study, created by the Center for Global
Development and Foreign Policy maga-
zine, gauged policies concerning aid, trade,
investment, migration, peacekeeping and
enviromnent according to help or harm
done to poor nations. On a 10-point scale,
the United States scored above a 3.0 only
once, and our average was a jaw—dropping
2.6.

The delusion that we as a country con-
tribute a lot of money to foreign aid could
not be further from the truth. While we
account for a whopping 22 percent of the
entire world’s economy, only one-tenth of 1
percent of our gross domestic product‘ is
distributed in foreign aid. Meanwhile, we

  

Pedja Jurisic
Columnist

spend over 25 percent of our discretionary
budget on defense spending at a time when
the major security threat — terrorism — does
not require the colossal mili-
tary we employ, but rather
accurate intelligence and spe-
cialized forces. That quarter of
the budget equates to over 400
billion dollars; that is the most
in the world. It totals more
than the next nine countries -
China, Russia, France, United
Kingdom, Germany, Italy,
India, Japan and Saudi Arabia
— combined. Also, it is more
than four times what we com-
mit to education and health
care together.

Presidential candidates George W.
Bush and John Kerry are both in a heated
race to present themselves as more quali-
ﬁed in ﬁghting the war on terror.
Unforttmately, the debate is focused on mil-
itary credentials and voting on military
issues. And it is the wrong focus. This is not
an issue of Republicans or Democrats. It is
one of a collective American misconcep-
tion that the solution to terrorism is solely a
military one.

No military, no matter how strong, can
prevent acts of terrorism on civilians —
September 11, 2001, proved that. Terrorism
is a tactic and cannot be eliminated alto-
gether, but it can be dealt with through
efforts towards eliminating its roots.
Poverty plays an essential role in this com-
plex equation.

Unforttmately, our historical self-inter-
est manifests itself in our lack of concern
for plight, starvation and death, unless it is

 

. of consequence domestically. A sense of

moral responsibility to help those less for-
trmate — affordably, when comparing the
values of dollars to human life — nonethe-
less remains absent ﬁom our society. Still,
this is not a matter of initiating action by
way of guilt or idealistic humanitarianism.
Instead, our lack of commitment toward
improving the living standards of those
most desperate remains a fundamental hur-
dle to defeating terrorism in the long run.

Keeping memories to treasure

Christopher, page 6

for a particular girl from my past. I just
can’t accept the concept that “out of
sight, out of mind” is a positive philoso-
phy. Why would I want to forget the best
day of my life? Because of how my life
right now can’t compare? I’d rather have
the memory to treasure. It might be log-
ical to move, on, but just what are we
moving toward? Are we to discard future

memories if things go sour? Whatever
demons might eat at me, I know that
they exist because of how wonderful and
special my memories have been. I don’t

want to lose that. I don’t want my life to I

change. I want it to evolve.

11 songs about a

This Affair Never Happened
 And Here Are 11 Songs
About It

The Bigger Lovers

Yep Roc Records

7i‘r7,‘ni‘r

Recommended if you like:
Fountains of Wayne; fun, yet
affected, pop

The December 2003 issue of GQ
magazine characterizes _the ever-
neglected genre known as power
pop as having “... a catchy chorus,
big guitar riffs and an overall cheer-

iness. The music of Philadelphia-»

based band The Bigger Lovers fits
this definition perfectly, especially
in their newest album — released in
March This Affair Never

F Happened  And Here Are 1] Songs

About It.

Described as being recorded
sometime between Rosh Hashanah
and Halloween, the album itself is
its own fun little holiday. As the
foursome’s third major release, fol-
lowing 200l’s How I Learned to
Stop Worrying and Honey in the
Hive, This Affair Never Happened

is a wonderful collection of
tracks that, unlike much of the
music in the pop genre, is successful
at being playful and bouncy," yet
never annoying. From the get-go,
the album sounds like a combination
between a ‘one-hit wonder from the
late 1960s and a selection from the
early days of Elvis Costello.

p The album’s first two tracks,
“You (You, You)” and “I Resign,”
are upbeat, with rhythms that harken
back to Dick Clark and American
Bandstand. This sound is coupled
with jaded lyrics, «many of which

“deal with love gone wrong. At some

points, it’s almost amusing to hear
bassist/songwriter Scott Jefferson’s
voice cheerfully whine things like
“same old shit/different year/it’s
great to fear the things you can’t
control” over a toe-tapping beat. .
The rest of the album features
both engagingly powerful rock —
like the speedy “Blowtorch”— and
swaying ballads. “Ninja Suit” and
“Hollywood,” for example, are two
prom-dance slow songs accented
with guitar riffs that crescendo and
soaring, harmonized vocals. One
can hear the melancholy nature of
“Hollywood” ‘ as guitarist Bret

hard
shit is

Tobias sighs “it’s
sleep/when the

V to
ankle

deep/but I still dream/and in a funny
way/it’s not as bad as it might‘ ‘

seem,” adding to the ﬂowing, yet
sad sound of the song.

The album finishes with “For
Christ’s Sake,” homage to a cold
and lonely Christmas in
Pennsylvania. This clever track is
distinctive with its transitions

between a happy falsetto chorus‘

wishing a merry Christmas and
happy New Year, to lyrics begging,
“Come back to me, my love/for

Christ’s Sake.” By the end of the ‘

song, the listener does not know
whether to _start caroling or pine
over some long lost love.

This new effort from The Bigger
Lovers makes for a pleasing experi-

ence that is a' careful balance
between ‘cynical bitterness and
beautiful chords.

Fortunately, The Bigger Lovers are
taking their unforgettable melodies
on tour this spring. Look for them
during their stop in Pittsburgh on
April 7 at the Club Cafe.

played some roles that simply scream
funny.

Although the three movies mentioned
are not comedies, Tony has appeared in a
few comedies, including “Life,” with
Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence and
“Don’t Be a Menace to South Central
While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,”
with Marlon and Shawn Wayans.

So what does all of this mean? Well, it
means that Tony wants to take acting seri-
ously. It means that he can play a funny
character as he did in “Don’t Be a
Menace.” It means that he can play a seri-
ous role and sometimes steal a scene like
he did in “American History X.” It also
means that no matter what role he plays in
a movie, he can still be funny as hell on
stage. "

The chance to see his comedic chops
comes this’ weekend when Guy Torry

Steve Harvey, Bernie Mac and Cedric the

, ,_g.,g_otWthe idea for thefilm.

From Uwire: Filmmaker shows Viewers Scabble subculture

JAMIE MURNANE
The Columbia Chronicle (Columbia College)

(U-WIRE) CHICAGO - Obsession, desire,
anticipation, risk and unpredictability: A love
affair? No, it’s the cutthroat world of competitive
Scrabble.

Thanks to filmmaker Scott Petersen,
Columbia students will be offered a glimpse into
the Scrabble subculture with a screening of his
documentary, “Scrabylon.”

Presented by Columbia’s Michael Rabiger
Center for Documentary and C—Spaces, the
screening, accompanied by a 16-player tourna-
ment students are encouraged to sign up for, will
be held at the Conaway Center on the first floor
of the 1104 Center, 1104 S. Wabash
Ave. The tournament, monitoredpby
the ~ Chicago Scrabble League,
begins at 3:30 p.m. and a single win-
ner will be announced at 10 p.m.

Petersen filmed “Scrabylon,”
which has been dubbed “a real life
‘Best in Show,”’ primarily during
the 2001 World Scrabble
Championships that were held in
Las Vegas. Peterson said he also
took trips to Chicago (where he’s
originally from), Detroit, Los
Angeles and San Diego for the
National Scrabble Championships in
August 2002.

While Petersen said he enjdis a
game of Scrabble now and then, e s
not a “hard—core player like some of
the people in the movie.”

Ultimately, it was the Scrabble
subculture and the obsession sur-
rounding the board game, which was
created in 1948, that interested him.

‘‘There’s just a tremendous
amount of obsession,” Petersen said.
“People get obsessed with any num-

obsessed with making movies, and
people out there are obsessed with
Scrabble or stamp collecting or
Whatever. And it’s interesting to see
why they get that way 

“It’s funny because some people
think, ‘Wow, that’s really freakish,’
but it’s only freakish if you’re not
obsessed with it  This is just one
group’s obsession, and there are a
lot‘ of different facets of it.” _,
According to the National Scrabble
Association, there is no small
Scrabble subculture, but a large and
continuously growing one that tran-
scends culturesiand borders. This is
exactly what the focus of Petersen’s
film was.

“It’s sort of about Scrabble,” he
said. “But it’s really about the
obsession and the different person-
alities.”

John D. Williams Jr., executive
director of the NSA and one of the
subjects of “Scrabylon,” said
Petersen came to the NSA when he

  

“Basically, I told him what I could and told
him who some of the interesting players were,
and he started following us around,” Williams
said.

According to Williams, aka “Mr. Scrabble,”
the NSA represents more than 10,000 Scrabble
club and tournament players in the United States
and Canada. It also sanctions approximately 200
tournaments every year, organizes the national
and world championships and even publishes the
Scrabble News.

“We also run a national school Scrabble pro-
gram in 20,000 schools around the country,”
Williams said. “And, if Scrabble’s going to be in
the movies or a television show, we read the
script to make sure it’s depicted right.”

 

  Ea

t ‘til1i'-'3°am

Williams, who has been the head of the NSA
since 1987, said his biggest accomplishment
came about last year, when the first televised
Scrabble match in history aired on ESPN. The
next big tournament is the national champi-
onships, which also will be televised.

“It will be July 31 through Aug. 5 in New
Orleans, and we’re expecting 800 Scrabble
experts at that from probably 40 states and seven
or eight different countries,” he said.

Another subject of “Scrabylon” is Chicago’s
own Marty Gabriel, who will be at Columbia for
a Q-and-A session following the film’s screening.
Gabriel, along with his wife, is a Scrabble expert.

This documentary captures the strategic art of playing Scrabble

Scrabble, page 13

“Scott contacted me through the
local Scrabble club, and I was at the
time one of the top, if not the top
player,” he said. “I think he liked
the idea that my wife and I were a
couple that played Scrabble — sort
of the glamour couple.”

In the “Scrabylon” description,
Gabriel is identified as the player
who drinks vinegar straight from the
bottle to intimidate his opponents,
but that wasn't his main intention.

“Sometimes, you’re a little slug-
gish, like in the morning, and people
think a little bit of coffee will help,

but I feel like the vinegar sort of
peps me up,” he said.

“Now Scott wrote in there about
the intimidation aspect, but I think
that’s kind of a little bonus  any-
thing to give you an edge.”

‘Gabriel said his athletic build‘
from years of playing sports also
probably throws some players off.
‘7Most of the players who tend to
play in the clubs tend to be more
mild—mannered,” he said. “If you
look at the words on a Scrabble box,
the words  areusually ones like

_safe,«quiet, home. So one of the sur-

prisesgwhen I got:.i,11vo"lv»edc with

pScra'bble’was to realize how com-

petitive a lot of the players are who
play in clubs and tournaments.

“I told my wife they should have
a skit on ‘Saturday Night Live’ or
something  have people playing
Scrabble and,» you see these old
ladies kind of getting into as. war of
words not just"or1 the board but kind
of cussing e—acfh' other out, gloating,
doing a little touchdown dance. It’s
not like that all the time but it’_s cer-
tainly more competitive thanepeople
would imagine?’ T "

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Going into the final rotation of
the East Atlantic Gymnastics League
Championships on Saturday, Pitt
needed a score of 49.625 to take the
lead over West Virginia University,
who was sitting in first place with a
final score of 197.050. .

1 But the Panthers were not watch-
ing the score.

“All we knew was that we were
having a good meet and we had to

_ continue having» a good meet,” head

coach Debbie Yohman said.

Unfortunately for the Panthers,
their last event was the balance beam,
where the average score put up by the
other seven competing teams was
48.250.

Alyse Zeffiro recorded the high-

1 est score on the beam for the Panthers

with a 9.825, but Pitt went on to fin-
ish in fourth place with a total score
of 196.050 — one point behind the
tournament winner West Virginia.
“We knew it was going to be very
competitive,” Yohman said. “We
knew every tenth [of a point] would
count in the end.” '

The Panthers’ scores on the vault .

and the ﬂoor competition were what
kept them right on West Virginia’s
tail. . . .

Pitt’s Erika Goldberg -scored a

9.900 on her ﬂoor routine as she

stuck every landing. Diandra
O’Connor, Roslyn Singleton and
Jessica Garber all posted a 9.850 on
their ﬂoor routines to give Pitt a
score of 49.275 in the event.

On the vault, Zeffiro, who earned
the EAGL’s Most Outstanding Senior
Athlete Award, posted the highest
score recorded on the vault in the

tournament. She landed perfectly,

barely ﬂinching, and ran to her team
to give them high—fives as judges
gave her a near-perfect score of
9.950.

April Pearson also stuck her land-
ing on the vault to receive a
9.875.0’Connor’s all-around score
was 39.300, with her highest score of
9.875 coming on the uneven bars.

University of North Carolina’s
Courtney Bumpers posted the highest
all-around score. The EAGL

Tournament rests on the shoulders .
of seniors Julius Page and laron \.

Brown. '
For the third year in a row, the
Panthers enter the Sweet ‘16,

although some were skeptical about
how far this squad would make it
through the season. Prior to the start
of the basketball season, the
Panthers were selected to finish
fourth in the Big East Conference
and were ranked No. 22 in the pre-
season poll. Pitt has exceeded
expectations; it is currently ranked
in the top 10 in the country and won
the Big East Conference.

Page and Brown remain from
the team that made back—to-back
appearances in the Sweet 16 as for-
mer Pitt players Brandin Knight,
Donatas Zavackas and Ontario Lett
graduated. While Brown has been

pretty consistent offensively this ‘

season, Page has struggled. But dur-
ing his stretch of offensive woes,
Page has played steady defensively.

An ankle injury has slowed Page
this season, but he refuses to allow
it to be an excuse. You have to
admire a player who takes responsi-
bility for his shortcomings rather
than looking to make excuses.

In Friday night’s ugly victory
over the Central Florida Golden
Knights, Page scored 10 points and
was two—for-12 shooting from the
ﬂoor and scored. But Page hit a cru-
cial three—pointer to put the Golden
Knights away.

He appeared to build on that
performance by scoring 12 points in
Sunday’s contest with University of
Wisconsin. Again he nailed crucial

Losing three NFC Championships worked for Philly

Philadelphians have been in a state of depres-
sion for the past three years — I know this
because I call the City of Brotherly Love home.

The Eagles have lost three straight NFC
Championships and have on great criticism for
choking from the media and fans.

But could three years of choking have been
what Philadelphia needed?

Terrell Owens said in a press conference last
Wednesday, after being acquired by Philadelphia,
that it was the interactions he had between coach-
es and players on the Eagles that made him want
to throw on a green jersey. These interactions
were all made possible by their losing. 1

Let me explain.

There is only one perk to losing in the confer-
ence championship game, and that is that the
coaching staff of the team gets to travel to Hawaii
to coach the Pro Bowl team from their respective
conferences. A

Philadelphia head coach Andy Reid has been
the coach of the NFC Pro Bowl team for the past
three years as result of three NFC Championship
losses.

This fact has allowed Owens to play for Reid
and work with his coaching staff three years in a
row. The time spent together in Hawaii allowed
Owens to see how the Eagles’ organization runs..

In addition, Eagle quarterback Donovan
McNabb attended the past four Pro Bowls and
played in three. He even connected with Owens
for touchdowns in the 2001 and the 2002 Pro
Bowls.

«; '1
‘~}n':'.\°

 

‘X’. ,N_,_
ha. ~

Owens also chose the Eagles because of the style
of offense. Reid runs the West Coast offense,
which Owens is -both familiar and comfortable
with. All these things combined, it seems like los-
ing three years in a row isn’t so bad after all.

Especially since Philadelphia hasn’t exactly
been losing. They’ve won more games than any
other team in the NFL in the past three years. And
they just won big time by signing Owens to a
seven—year, $42 million deal — only losing a
fifth-round draft pick to, the Baltimore Ravens
and a defensive tackle, Hollis Thomas to the San
Francisco 49ers. Q ‘

With McNabb’s 12-year, $115 million deal he
signed in 2002 not running out any time soon,
these two Pro Bowl players" can hook up for
touchdowns until the year 2011.

This could open the door for something that
has not been seen in a while: an actual football

dynasty,-much like the last couple each headed by .

quarterback-wide receiver hook ups like Joe
Montana and Jerry Rice of the 49ers and Troy

Q

Aikman and Michael Irvin of the Dallas
Cowboys. 4

“To put him right in that mix with the other
receivers and tight ends and running backs, and
the support that our offensive linemen give us and
then obviously Donovan—— I just think it presents
itself to be an explosive package,” Reid said at
the press conference last Wednesday.

. The mix of McNabb and Owens can prove to
be one of the best quarterback-wide receiver com-
binations in the past 10 years.

“It’s chemistry in the making,” Owens said, in
reference to his relationship with McNabb. “I’m
excited to be here and to play with D-Mac.”

Owens also commented on how his off—the—
field troubles will not become a distraction in
Philadelphia. He looks at this as a new beginning
for him, and it is.

He is out of the organization, the 49ers, which

he has clashed with for the past couple years. And

he now_ has a chance to start over.

“Right now, I have a clean rap sheet , so to
speak,” Owens said.

_ And so does Philadelphia.

T»heelost NFC Championship games are now
forgotten, just as Owens’ Sharpie. incident is the
talk of yesterday. -

It’s a new beginning for Owens, for the Eagles
and for the passionate fans of Philadelphia.

Page’s aggressive playon
offense helped his scoring

Nocks, page 15 ‘

shots for the Panthers. Page has
been hounded for the last month
about losing confidence in his
shooting and has insisted that he
hasn’t.

I would have to agree with him.
It’s not like he stopped shooting
completely. Page was just missing
his target. Sometimes badly, and
other times just because of unlucky
bounces.

During his last two games, Page
has begun more aggressively open-
ing up shot possibilities. He has
been driving to the basket instead of
just opting to shoot jumpers all the
time. Against Central Florida,«not4
many shots were falling for him, but
I could see that if he continued to be
aggressive that his shots would
eventually fall and he converted
more buckets against Wisconsin.

In a way, Brown has switched
places with Page through the first
two games of the tournament. He
has not heavily contributed to Pitt’s
scoring in the tournament, but has

of the

done the little‘ things. Brown was
zero-for-five shooting field goals on
Friday night as he finished with just
three points, but bounced back to
connect on two of seven shots along
with four critical free throws for a
total of eight points on Sunday. ,

While Brown did not light up‘
the scoreboard over the weekend, he
contributed on the glass as he made
a critical rebound that sent him to
the foul line in the closing minutes
Panthers’
Wisconsin.

He also drewthe assignment of‘
guarding Wisconsin guard Devin’
Harris for the second half of the
game. Harris hit the Panthers up for
15 first—half points, and was guard-
ed by Page for the majority of the
half. Page played him tough, but a
few of Harris’ baskets were not able
to be contested due to! both fast
breaks and transition. , —

At 6 feet 4 inches, 229 pounds,
Brown was able to usehis 154-pound
advantage over the 6—foot-3-inch

‘ West Virginia was led by fresh-
man Janae Cox and Jessica Bartgis
who both posted 'all—around scores

nament. Both girls scored 9.950 on

North Carolina State finished in
