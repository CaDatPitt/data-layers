Pitt Subject of Budget Review

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Pitt administration is the subject
of a state-level report to be issued
tomorrow by Governor Shapp’s
management review team after an
investigation of University opera-.
tions. . '

The review team, which began
its inquiry in May, has drawn up a
list of recommendations for change
at Pitt as well as Penn State and
Temple.

A Harrisburg source said tuition
remission, a controversial reim-
bursement for tuition costs of
children of faculty, was questioned
at Temple, where the/ review team
felt it could-be eliminated, but was
not mentioned concerning Penn
State or Pitt. _

The source said the team’s
report on Pitt included the
following recommendations for
structural changes: ' '

--Pitt should merge-its Titusville
campus with the Clarion State

.Venango campus to increase

utilization, - saving

$200,000 annually.
--The University should establish

a consulting service for the

a projected

_industrial sector, to charge" as much

as a 30% fee for consulting work
using "University equipment‘, often
done now, against regulation by
faculty members. i 1
“University faculty are doing
private consulting work although
not officially permissible,” the
source quoted the report. ‘Some
personnel utilize school facilities
and support staff in connection
with their project, although the

Blacks Widely Accept BAS  

\

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

A majority of black undergradu-
ate students at-Pitt say they belong
to the Black Action Society (BAS),
according to a Pitt News poll taken
last week.

Sixty-four of 100 who were asked
the question “Do you belong to the
Black Action Society?” answered
in the affirmative, while 34 said
they did not and two were
undecided. .

Of the 34 blacks who said they
weren't members, 16 were aware
of the BAS policy to include
automatically all black students at
Pitt in the organization.

According to the group’s consti-
tution, every undergraduate black
student is a member of the BAS.

All students but one who said
they weren’t affiliated with the
organization said they read the
BAS News, the group’s bi-weekly
newspaper.

Almostievery BAS member who
expressed an opinion said the
organization was involved in a
struggle of one sort or another.

“The BAS is an active organiza-
tion that's.moving steadily against
resistance toward meeting its goal

of activating black students,-

bringing quality teachers into black
studies, and altering racist views
on campus,” according to Leevan

, Davis, a junior adminstrative

justice and psychology major. “It's
doing a pretty good job so far.”

Junior physical education major I,

Harold Williams agreed with

Davis‘ view of BAS goals, but gave
a less optimistic view of the
struggle.

“The BAS is striving to change a
lot of bad things on campus,”
Williams said, “but ‘the adminis-
tration is too set in its ways to let
them change.”

Levi Thompson, a junior ‘engin-
eering student, said the organiza-
tion’s ultimate struggle was a
monetary one.

“If the University funded more
money to BAS,” Thompson said,
“more black students could join the
organization and our social activi-
ties could expand.” ,

..Iunior biology major Sherwin
Wilcox also cited a shortage of
funds as a problem for the group.

“Until it gets more funds for
activities,” Wilcoxsaid, “BAS will
seem to be just a namesake
organization.”

Those students who said they
weren’t BAS members but were
aware of the BAS policy to
automatically include them in the
group, considered the policy as
an option.

“It's not a question of member-
ship to_me," senior English major
Dave Page said. "1 consider BAS
open to me—like student govern-
ment. 1 can actively participate in
the organization if I choose to, but
I'm not obligated.”

Dan Washington,
majoring in political science, said

1 he signed »a paper stating his

interest ‘in the BAS at an

organizational meeting this year,

a junior.

but hasn’t actively participated in
the organization’s work yet.
“Because I’m an athlete,”
Washington said, -“I’ve got very
little time to give to BAS. But I"
consider it an advantage to have
the option of working in the group
since it does provide many beneﬁts
for people inside and out of it.”
Nearly everyone ‘_who wasn’t

For Pitt-PSU Game

‘ New Football Plan Possible ’

BY TOM WENSTON

A modified student football
ticket-distribution plan might be
needed for the Pitt-Penn State
game on ‘November 22 if the
American Broadcasting Company
(ABC) decides to televise it,
according to Student Government
Board (SGB) member Craig Blue-
stein.

The game will be moved to Three.

Rivers Stadium if ABC picks up the
game. ‘
Individuals with different color-
coded coupons _ could not sit
together if seats are reversed,
Bluestein said, and ABC is not
required to announce which game
will be televised -until the Monday
before the game. Ticket distribu-
tion would _be"under way by then

University gets no revenue from
this activity.”

The Unive'rsity could save as
much as $300,000, the source said.

--By establishing a University
Health Service Corporation to
provide the School of Medicine
with faculty services, changing the

_current method of tenure for

practicing MDs, the University
could save $800,000.
--By cutting down on storehouse

inventory in the Physical. Plant_

warehouse, Pitt could net ‘$100,000.
--In making the University'Press 1
self-supporting, by more compre-
hensive planning of computer
usage in the Computer Center, and
by reducing copy machine usage,
the University could save $100,000,
$120,000 and $125,000 respectively

In the area of expenditures, the
source said, the report recom-
mends a $75,000 expenditure for
electronic surveillance equipment
in the dorms to improve security.

“Students consistently -utilize
the ﬁre doors and garage entrances
to gain access to the Towers dorms.

This breach of security provides
ready entrance to residential areas
by unauthorized persons. The
student press has emphasized the
need for improved security,” the

Trustee Intervention  
Asked in Cop Dispute

BY DAN KOHUT I

Pitt Board of Trustees members
are being asked to intervene in an

' ongoing contract dispute between

Campus Police and the University
involving a controversial subcon-
tracting clause, State House
member Joseph Rhodes, Jr. said
here Friday.

Rhodes, an East Liberty Demo-
crat, expressed concern with the
plight of Pitt campus police. “I am
asking State Representative K.
Leroy Irvis (Hill District) and State
Senator Eugene Scanlon (North
Side), both members of the

University Board of Trustees,’ to _

under the present plan.

“If the game is moved to Three
Rivers, students will still be
allotted 10,010 seats, but they may
be blocks of reserved seats in
different parts of the stadium,”
Bluestein said.

“We’d prefer a general admis-
sion section for all students, so
friends could sit together even if
they exchange their coupons for
tickets on different days,” he
added.

“The secvond problem is that
Pitt might not know until the.
Monday before the game where it’s

.going to be played,” Bluestein,

said. ‘_‘The usual coupon ticket
exchange begins on Friday, eight
days before the game.” ‘

 Athletic Director Casimir Mys-

 

 

report reads, according to the 4'

Harrisburg source. _

The review team called for an
automatic vehicle identifying sys- '
tem, card. readers and a central ;
monitoring system, and suggested
Housing Director Tom Albert sit

down immediately to discuss this

because it could entail less privacy
due to electronic measures. ..
The report also suggested the

assessment of a $50 fee to residents‘ V"

to be paid prior to occupancy.

Those involved in vandalism would

forfeit the fee.
The review

team at Pitt

conducted a study for one month in ' g V
a follow-up of a 1972 analysis —

conducted in all state and

state-related services in Pennsyl- 4.

Vania. .

The information compiled by the
management review team will be
made public with the release of the
report tomorrow.

The original report, filed in 1972,
suggested removal of the tuition
remission benefit, consolidation of .
Pitt’s library system, and a‘
reduction in administrative staff. _

Student leaders were invited by,
Vice Chancellor of Operation and
Finance Joe Dutton to submit

questions to the review team ‘for  

consideration. in the current study.

intervene,” Rhodes said.
“Campus police are competent
—doing a first-rate job,” Rhodes
said. “The police should be left
alone.” ' 1

Members of the Campus Police.‘ ..

union and the University Depart-
ment of Labor Relations will meet
in an attempt to resolve the current
contract issue. ' A ;
Robert Kolesky, steward for the
Campus Police chapter of Team-

_ sters Local -249, said he has hopes V‘ l_

"for a successful meeting. V -

- Kolesky said the police probably r

will not walk off their jobs.
(Continued on Page 3 ) I

linski said Friday it might be

possible to avoid implementing a 7

new student ticket plan. “Strictly

speaking, ABC doesn't have to
choose a game until the -Mondayl A

before the game,” Myslinski said.

“That's the rule, but we hope we’ll ' p

be able -to_ﬁnd out earlier.

“We’ll talk to stadium officials.._

and the unions at Three Rivers,”_
Myslinski added. “We’ll try to
eliminate the reserved seat situa-
tion, but we may not be able to.”

Discussion of possible alterna-
tive student ticket-distribution sys-,
tems has not started yet, according
to Bluestein. “I’ll be meeting with
(Assistant Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs) William Markus
this Wednesday to discuss" the

problem,”‘ Bluestein said. ;

   Unusual Foresight . . . .

One of the perennial problems of government at any level is turning
the works over to the next administration. The trouble lies not with the
- new leaders being unaccustomed to the job, but with the outgoing
leaders’ shortsightedness in providing for neat carry-overs on the big
issues. - c

deal effectively with the matter.

Admittedly caught unaware last summer when the 14% tuition hike
was announced, the Board is going to unusual lengths to make sure the
next Board isn’t in the same vulnerable position."

Much of the responsibility for the program lies with SGB member
Mark Satinoff, who was probably the most vehemently opposed
member to the tuition hike, and who plans to contact various
organizations in a search for ways to prevent rising tuition.

‘SGB President Larry Platt is correct in assuming we haven’t
necessarily seen the last raise in tuition. It’s to his credit that he seeks
to instill-next year’s leaders not only with the same watchful waiting,

butalsowithameanstoﬁghtnewhikes.

Exactly what this program will be is as yet unknown." But if
Satinoff’ s enthusiasm for the issue remains consistent, there will be
much work and investigation on his part for students to follow in the
months ahead. -

P   .. . . Successful Turnout

Another healthy sign on campus came last week at the Candidates’
Day Rally sponsored by the College Young Democrats and College
Young Republicans. _

Over half the candidates invited showed up and the student tmnout
was equally good. Though the indication wasn’t signiﬁcant enough to
conﬁrm a new student interest in politics, it was a good sign that recent
events in American govemment haven’t disillusioned students
altogether. .

’ Whether the candidates who decided to come were merely conscious
of campus votes will never be known. But face-to-face meetings
between local politicians and their constituents are much more
effective than the more popular meetings with national ﬁgures.

For this reason we hope the candidates came away with some
genuine impressions they'll be able to use if elected.

The campus political groups did students a great service in

« sponsoring the event, since. the level of government closest to us is the
one that ironically suffers the most neglect.

Every year around this time the
Allocations Committee begins‘ to
consider what changes should be
instituted into the allocations
process. The intent is to learn from
mistakes made in the past inherent

mendations to alleviate those
problems. ,

Despite these admirable inten-

the problems that perennially

appear in the allocations system.

Whats a Homecoming Queen?

BY TOM WASELESKI

Lately I walk across campus and
scarcely can believe this" is 1975. I
mean, really——-a homecoming
queen?

To be chosen from the fairest of
the fair, to be adorned in splendor
surpassed only by her radiant
beauty, to reign victorious, to sit a
queen.

“A homecoming queen,” she
writes, “should be honest and
loyal. She should like people and be
friendly. I think I can be a good
homecoming queen because of my
involvement with the campus
groups I have listed. Most
important of all, a homecoming
queen’ should have spirit because
without it she can’t be enthusiastic
about her team and serve as a good
example _for ‘ the rest of the

 

not to fund the hockey club is a thereby gaining. part] or all of the

prime example of this.

The people of the Allocations
Committee are not evil creatures
delighting in using illegal powers.
They are merely bureaucrats forced
into using these powers because of
deﬁciencies in the constitutional
structure of Student Government
(SG). . A

Last year, the committee tried to

institute reforms by changing the
funding guidelines and trying to
change the allocations process.

But no usable set of guidelines
could be formed that were less
arbitrary. Further, the actual
process of allocations, requests and
the sequence of interviews could
not be changed» without” an
amendment tothe SG constitution.
In fact, one amendment was
recomended by the committee, but
it -A was killed by — last -year’s

passed,’ the general effect would
have been minimal... No signiﬁcant

allocation reforms can take place

unless ’ - the whole . bureaucratic
structure-of'Student Government is

The -:;..most important change

vwould be to put the power of the

purse in the. hands of -elected
representatives. This is dependent
on increasing the number of
representatives.

If the board were merely
expanded, then a committee
composed partly of representatives
and partly of appointed bureau-
crats would be possible. But if the
representative body were larger.
then the allocations committee
could be composed entirely of
elected students.  v '

In either case it is important

those‘ elected take part in the»
research and interviewing process, _

‘real power. _

There is a dual purpose to any
reform. Not only should the
process be fairer to student
organizations, but any changes
should help to strengthen SG’s
power in dealing with the adminis-
tration.

-When the board two years ago
tried to get the athletic department
to fund the hockey club, there was
no real unity and strength in the
effort. The resolution was more the
result of an allocation’s power play
than the true feelings of ‘the board
and its president. ’

By putting the money more

directly under the control of the

elected body, it would be easier to
create a ‘war chest’ to be used in

battles with the administration .

at ,As the system. stands now-,Uthe

board has to submit a ‘request to
' .the:Allocations Committee, which

couldcause deadly delays if some

.. of its’ members disagree with board

policy. M
A The greatest. argument against‘

jhaving electedofﬁcials take care of

allocations ‘is it will be too

'burdening and willidetract from

their dealing with important issues.
This is doubtful because the ﬁnal
allocations usually breakdown into
three distinct‘ areas. q

The largestis comprised of six or
seven organizations who receive a.
sizable chunk of the activities fee
and whose services are most widely
used and beneﬁcial to students.

A These include such groups as the

Pitt News,» BAS, SG Programming
and Legal Awareness. These (plus

i a fewothers) take up over half of

' .~.-«:1,-—.».».

the activities fee.

‘ Instead of having these groups "

students....” _

I often have wondered what a
homecoming queen is, just as I'm
sure the queens often have‘
wondered what they really are.

Other than sexist competition,

(why not a homecoming king?),
what else can it possibly be?

Usually words crop up during the
judging, words -like “spirit” or
“represent,” and then I see her
circling the football ﬁeld in a shiny
convertible—her, spirited? Repre-
sent who, me? Where, at an
afternoon tea?

If it really has anything to do
with spirit, Ithink Tiger Paul would

” make a good homecoming queen. I

can see hi-m rol_ling all over__ that
track right now. He'd have more
people on their feet in that stadium
than would Tony Dorsett. Tiger
Paul wouldn’t last long in the back
seat of that car; he’d be throwing
his rosebuds into the stands and
waving his tiara to lead the crowd
in a rousing rendition of some
familiar cheer.

But then, if a homecoming queen
has anything to do with represent-
ing students, I'd like to see Larry
Platt as queen. I can see him
fighting for whatever homecoming
queens ﬁght for, defending stu-
dents against whatever homecom-
ing queens defend students
against, articulating those ideas

that students express ‘to their
homecoming queens, whatever
those ideas are.... _

The way these girls campaign for
queen, you’d think there was really
something to the job. And the
endorsements by campus groups,
as if it were a student government
election.

The BAS endorses this one, the
frats endorse that one, the Owl
endorses another one (yeah,
honest, the Owl). It’s as if each
group had a vested interest in its
girl, as if she were going to
institute some valuable and bene-
ﬁcial policy by which the group
would proﬁt.

But they’re just a bunch of pretty 5,.‘
faces. Pretty faces that dry out and’ ‘ ‘ '

wrinkle and look back into old
yearbooks at the pretty faces and

. say, “Ah, the year I was queen.”

And that’s as far as it goes.

It’ll be interesting to see what
little item they give away this year
to coerce students to vote for one of
the pretty faces. It really doesn’t
matter? since they garnered plenty
of votes one year for giving kazoos.

I’ll still be wondering, though, at

_ the top of Pitt Stadium, tooting my

new whistle or blowing my bottle of
bubbles, who that girl is behind the
pretty face and what does she think
she'll ever do for me.

Busing

\Vhat Can It Do?

BY CAL RITCHEY

Last month I put my name to a
Column in which I voiced serious
doubts about the efficiency of
busing students in order to provide
more racial balance in schools.

In the Pitt News of September
24, Mark Satinoff and Elwin Green,
representing themselves as coor-
dinators for the Pittsburgh branch
of the Student Coalition Against

Busing can succeed only in
eradicating the tenuous peace that
has grown between racial groups in
the past few years. When children
see their parents grow violent
(apparently) because the children
are being bused to another school,
it is natural that the children will
begin to repeat what their parents
say. I Eventually, the children
probably will look at the other

racial groups in the same manner
their parents do——something the
busing is supposed to circumvent.

But there is another excellent
reason for halting the busing.
When children--and I include
anyone still attending school
through the twelfth grade--are
taken away from their home
neighborhoods and transported
several miles to strange neighbor-
hoods, they are more prone to
mischief than they might be nearer
their homes. If the kids know they
won't be recognized by Mr. Smith
who lives next door, the tempta-
tions offered by their peers
becomes more enticing.

Monday, October 20, l975—-THE PITT NEWS—Page 5

Ask anyoiie.who_‘s_.fbeen' in. the .

armed forces; when men and
women get away from home and
are thrust by circumstances into
close-knit groups, the tend to lose
much of the inhibitions they might
normally experience. The same
holds true of the traditional college
experience: Remember some of
the things you might have done as
a freshman away from home for the
first time. Chances are good you
might not have acted that way back
home.

What I said about the logic of
busing still stands. I do not think
busing offers any solution to the

problems. Ftanqkly‘, 1 do not’ have
any miraculous antidote either.
But at a time when so many
Americans are protesting so much
violence, it seems stupid, if not
criminal, to endorse a “solution”
that has been proven to lend itself
to violence.

_The SCAR coordinators were
kind enough to invite me to‘a
lecture, which was to have taken
place on Wednesday, September
24. Unfortunately, I did not see
that issue of the Pitt News until
Thursday. If _ I have another
opportunity, I Wlll attend a similar
lecture.

and averred that the trouble came
from inherent and lingering preju-
dice ‘among members of the
communities [by inference, the

« ‘gwhite communities] in Boston and
‘ Louisville, both cities hard hit by

violence in the wake of forced
busing.

It is difficult to refute that
argument. In fact, I did not deny
that racism is the root of the
violence. I did deny that busing
will solve the roblems.

“The training gets us ready to
deal with people. We have to have
our own head together before we
can get on the phone and tell
someone else what to do. We also
get some indication of how
effective the members will be
answering the phones,” Barnett
said.

After learning to function as a
group, the members got down to
speciﬁc information on drugs,
sexuality and phone procedures.

During the drug session, mem-
bers were instructed on the use of
the Physician's Desk Reference
(PDR) and given general informa-
tion on different classes of drugs
and the effects of each. The PDR
contains information and pictures
of all pills manufactured by
American pharmaceutical compan-
ies. If a caller says'he does not
‘know what he took, the volunteer
can use a description of the pill to
look it up in the PDR.

“If someone calls and says

they’re strung out on barbituates,
can you tell them to take
amphetamines to counteract the
effect?” a trainee asked.

“No way,” Samulski said.
“They don't cancel each other out.
One chemical would be pulling him
down, one pulling him up, and’the
body would be ﬁghting both.

“The best thing you can do if
someone’s doing downs and thinks
they’re dying is to keep them
awake. Tell them to open the
windows, not to eat, take their

. clothes off and soak in ice water.

They can .turn on bright lights or
loud music, anything to keep the
brain functioning.

“If the brain’s functioning, it can
ﬁght it. Make them go to a
hospital. It’s better to overreact
than underreact.”

“It may sound cruel,” said
Craig, “but pain is one of the most
effective ways of combating a down
overdose."

General guidelines on how to‘

Little Help Volunteers—Just a Phone  Away

handle an overdose call also were
discussed. Volunteers were in-
structed to ﬁnd out what drug the
caller has taken, how much, how
long ago, and whether anyting was
taken with it. In addition, the caller
should be informed of the location
of the nearest hospital.
Information given to A Littl
Help is conﬁdential. ’

“A Little Help was originally
funded ,by the Mental Health and
Mental Retardation Emergency
Fund,” Barnett said, “but they
wanted us to keep records of the
names and addresses of the callers.

' This destroyed conﬁdentiality, so

we dropped our afﬁliation and are
now funded by the Undergraduate
Student Organization’?

The A Little Help hotline is open
from 8 pm to midnight. A 24-hour
answering service handles calls
during the rest of the day. A Little

  Cathedral: One Man ’s Dream

BY AMY C. HODGSON

— The Chancellor rejected sketch
after sketch, and discouraged

Philadelphia architect Charles Z."

Klauder ﬁnally quit drawing for a
few minutes and put a record on his
phonograph.

Former Chancellor John G.
Bowman and the architect listened
until, at 4 am, Klauder drew a
three-inch sketch that satisﬁed his
guest’s expectations for a sky-
scraper college, a Cathedral of
Learning.

If inspiration can translate itself

into perspiration, Bowman pers- '

pire_d a great deal during his early
chancellorship at Pitt. He
conceived the idea of building a
tower on campus and for several
was its only staunch

vote against building any structure
more than 100 feet tall on the
14-acre Pitt campus and the
unannounced groundbreaking pro-
ceeded to a bulldozer’s drone
instead of the rasp of a gold shovel.

Shortly before Bowman took
ofﬁce in 1920, Pitt's trustees has
spent $30,000'on fund-raising that
netted only $28,000 for the

' University. By the time the new

chancellor took ofﬁce, Pitt was in
debt $2 _million.

Bowman argued» with creditors
that they would have to support his
project if the school was to ﬂourish
sufﬁciently to repay its debts. Over
the years, the Chancellor’s tenacity
and energy won’ support from
philanthropists and local indus-
trialists. However, many local
groups opposed" an indebted
university undertaking such a
massive project.

Women's groups tried to rezone
the site on the grounds that a lone
tower would sway dangerously in
the wind. Though. no one ever
explained why students would
more likely _tumble from high
windows than low ones, a women's
group championed this fear as well.

Ideally the project would unite

Pittsburgh behind its university.
The community would express
itself by supporting the construc-
tion of “a tower singing upward

‘ that would tell the epic story of

Pittsburgh,” as Bowman later
wrote in his book, Unofficial Notes.

In 1925 several months of
campaigning brought in more than
$9 million in contributions for the
structure. Corporate contributions,
then a new idea, led the way.

shortened the structure by nine '

stories. After Bowman deﬁed the
trustee vote against the tall
structure, all related contracts
contained a paragraph allowing Pitt
to delay or cancel construction
without further obligation.
Through perseverance and luck,
the last steel rivet was driven home
on October 21, 1929. Most
masonry was completed a year
later, leaving the ﬁrst four ﬂoors

The prospect of a towering
university building attracted
nationwideattention, almost all of
it favorable, and the New York
Times ran one of Klauder’s
drawings the entire length of its
ﬁrst feature page.

Nonetheless, more than a year
before the 1926 groundbreaking,
several large contributors attemp-

I ‘Dog’ To Score With Oscars

Its “comedy” is strictly pathos
in a classic sense; the ﬁlm has to be
marked more as a character study
than anything. The action itself is
unnoticeably slow, while the actual
setting is quite static.

BY M. C. PILECKI

Not so very long ago Washington
columnist Art Buchwald was
_,--wondering in print if the same guys
'-'1.”"~'“who write the news write the TV
detective shows, and vice versa.

Something pretty close to that
has happened with Sidney Lumet’s
latest, Dog Day Afternoon, a tale
for which the old saw, “Truth is
stranger than ﬁction,” seems to
have been invented.

To be sure, the plot of Afternoon
is so preposterous that it would
have been dismissed long ago if it
weren’t for the fact that the ﬂick is
based _on a fairly ‘recent bank
robbery.

The case was quite a sensational
one at the time, and anyone who
was near a radio, TV or newspaper

,r..i__n ‘August, 1972, will remember
"""""—r’r'iost of the bizarre details. Two
amateurs bungle a bank robbery as
New York's ﬁnest surround the
building. To get out of one mess,
— the robbers demand a helicopter
and a free jet trip in exchange for
their hostages, the bank’s staff.
During the negotiations the reason
behind the holdup is discovered:
One of the would-be thieves, a
married man with two children,
needed the moneyfor his “other
wife,” a man, to get a desired sex
change operation.

Only in New York. And Brooklyn
at that.

.,.-3 The movie version portrays the

‘if-1'robbery as a continuous comedy of

errors and incongruities: as Sonny
(Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale)
are herding their hostages into the

‘bank vault, one demands to- go to
the bathroom; while passing the
time in the surrounded bank,
Sonny teaches one of the female
hostages how to execute a military
drill with his gun; when the police
agree to send out for pizzas for the
robbers and the hostages, Sonny
insists on paying the tab. And on
and on.

In retrospect, one can easily fault
the movie for making stick-up men

cutesy and bank robbery look like a _

lot of fun, and the satirists will
surely pick up on those later when
Dog Day Afternoon is an establish-
ed hit. Because, no matter what
else you can say about the movie, it
is never dull. That’s quite a
recommendation for any ﬂick.

Afternoon has a lot going for it.
Heist ﬁlms always have a certain
amount of popularity, especially
when mixed with comedy. And the
fact that a story is based on actual
occurrences--with an extra plus for
an event still fairly fresh in
memory--gives it an extra magne-
tism. 

But the truth doesn’t always
insure a bigbox ofﬁce (remember
Supercops, among others?), or for
that matter, a good movie.
Director‘ Lumet and actor Pacino
combined their talents once before
in the fact-to-ﬁlm entry, Serpico,
and came up with a winning
combination.

You see, Afternoon isn’t really a
“heist” ﬁlm. Nor is it a
cops-and-robbers ﬂing. And,
despite all the laughs the ﬁlm
provides, it cannot be called a

comedy by the longest stretch of ‘A;

the imagination. _

A far cry from institutionalized
religion, Chassidism is Judiasm at
a grass-roots level. Chassidic
music I is characteristic of this
unconﬁning free-ﬂowing view of
life. .
Often linked with Sholom
Aleichem and Fiddler on the Roof,
Chassidim maintain a unique
fairytale-like existence in today’s
changing times. Pleasure is
-derived from the simple joys of
living. Each dayis sacred. Proof of
their intensive rejoicing in living,
carried through warm melodious
song, can be observed at a peak on
Simchat Torah evening.
Rejoicing of the Torah, Simchat-

flag-waving ceremonies in which
the celebrants march around with
Torahs.

Last year, while in Jerusalem, I
witnessed an overwhelming public
celebration of such dancing and
singing. Especially visible were
expressive tears of joy distinguish-
ing the newly arrived Russian
immigrants. Such a display of vivid
public emotion would be greeted by
fire hoses in the Soviet Union.
Young and old joined hands and

hearts in unison.

as possible distractions from

The bottles of whiskey are
running low as it gets close to 11.
Having danced since 7:30, the men
grow, weary as they await the ﬁnal
reading of the Torah. The rabbi is
distinguished only by his black and

There is no pulpit to elevate him

Sonny, through the expertise of
Pacino, emerges as a tragic hero
whose destiny is clear as soon as
the ﬁlm starts.

‘Grease’ Be-bops I

BYMATTHEWKENNEDY

Grease, the ’50s comic musical,
ﬁnally made it to Oakland last
Friday and the results were
outstanding.

A cool, smooth-dressed ’70s

crowd ate up the primitive
sophistication of the characters.

First and foremost was Eddy, a‘
black leather-jacketed hood con-
stantly thwarted by his

inner

.j,._, 
fathers’ legs, indiscriminatory in
the tugging of jackets. So ends a
fun night of warm uplifting song
and dance with the Chassidim.

Four men and four women take
the stage in what has been billed as
an Israeli Chassidic Festival.
Wearing tight-ﬁtting jumpsuits in
various shades of blue, they leave
no doubt that they’re authentic
Israelis. Just as American pizza
parlors now compete with indigen-
ous falafel stands of Jerusalem, so
do the passionate Chassidic melo-
dies clash with these eight
beautiful young Israelis, prancing
around in sexy costumes.

One member of the group,
accompanied by staged disapproval

the songs to relate Chassidic
stories. Except for a few, most
stories are akin to Don Rickles

Entertaining a family audience,
the group performed well-known

TONY DORSETT

Tony Dorsett—No  
Change |nThree Yeals

BY JIM SPANOS

“My way of living hasn’t
changed in the last two years. I’ve
gotten a little more mature;that
comes with age. I’ve learned to
handle myself a little better around
people. I don’t want people to look
at me and say, well, I’m Tony
Dorsett, you got to treat me
different than you would someone

‘else. I’m just like any other human

being. You treat me like a man and
I’ll treat you like a man.”—Tony
Dorsett

When a fast-talking southerner
named Johnny Majors and an

equally fast running back from

Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, hit the
Pitt scene two years ago, little did
anybody know the “Major

Change” would occur as rapidly as .

it did.

What Majors has done with his
enthusiasm and his love fo_r
into the unknown,

and his heart. Within both men
there is something in the spirit and
the mind that drives a man to reach
his fullest potential and his own

- place in history.

Dorsett’s place in the annals of
Pitt football history is already a
secure one. Gaining 1,686 yards as
a’ freshman (including 265 yards
against Northwestern in one game
and 209 yards against Notre Dame

. in another) and l,004_.yards as a

sophomore was certainly no small
feat. ‘ ' ‘

That Dorsett was an exceptional
runner became evident almost as

soon as the .1973 season had.

started; that he was rugged enough
to take the punishmentof playing
against a physical defense did not
become known until a cold, windy,
snowy day -in -November; of. his

freshman year. Pittlost the game,‘
- 3l-l0, against Notre Dame, but

Dorsett rambled for 209 yards
against a defense well known for
being tough against the run. It was
the most yardage ever accumulated
against a Notre Dame team. V

Dorsett’s running style is as hard
to deﬁne as he is to catch once he

-gets in the openV ﬁeld. Watching

Dorsett run with the ball, one
immediately knows he iswatching
a great runner. But when the play
is over and Dorsett springs to his
feet, all that remains isa vision, a
picture, in the mind. He's there
one second and gone the next.
Smooth..Elusive. Deceiving. There

is almost something poetic about.
the way Dorsett runs with the ball-.

Army coach Homer Smith
certainly would agree. Dorsett
broke loose for 268 yards and four
touchdowns against Army. He
again shattered Pitt rushing
records. He broke his own
single-game rushing mark set
against Northwestern, and became
Pitt ‘ .
Pitt’s all-time leader in career
touchdowns with 34. And he
greatly enhanced his chances for
this third consecutive 1,000-yard
season. He needs just 271 more
yards this year to reach 1,000, and
if he gains 1,000 next year,.he’ll be
the ﬁrst runner in collegiate history
to do so.

“Anthony Davis was nothing like
Tony Dorsett,” Smith stated.
“James McA1ister was nothing like
Tony Dorsett. Archie Grifﬁn is not
as good as Tony Dorsett in the open
ﬁeld. '

“I have not seen a running back
like Tony Dorsett since O.J.
Simpson. His change of pace is so
subtle you almost can’t see it.”

‘‘I have some power, but that’s
not my style of running,” Dorsett
explained. “I try to avoid hitting
people. I really don’t want to hit
people unless it’s necessary.

“It’s a terriﬁc feeling to be able
to do some of the things that I can
do. I'm just blessed with some
God-given talent and I’m very
fortunate to have this. I'm just

hoping that I can stay healthy and.

keep in moving.”
Against Georgia, Dorsett’ started

~ the year with a typical “TD”
. performance, gaining 104 yards on

just 15 carries. In that same game,

quarterback. Robert Haygood car-

ried the ball 24 times, due in part to
the fact that Georgia, like many
other teams, was keying. on
Dorsett. After averaging 27 carries
per game as a freshman and 22- per

.gam.e as .a sophomore, Dorsett

hasn’t been as active this year.

Over the ﬁrst ﬁve games ’this_

season, he had been averaging 17
carries per game. So the logical
question was would Dorsett like to
have carried the ball- more?

“Definitely,” he stated _last
week. “I’ve talked to a few people
about it and they feel I should be
carrying the ball more.

“I’m not trying to say that I’m a
ballhog or a glory man or
something like - that, but I’ve
achieved a lot of accomplishments.

in my ﬁrst two years here and I feel I
that I have to live up to my laurels. '

WEST POINT, New York-Will
somebody please pity Pitt Head
Football Coach Johnny Majors? His
Panthers broke and tied so many
records in the mud while mauling
the Army Cadets, 52-20, no doubt
he will be suffering writer’s cramp
for a long time to come. -

Here are the records known to be
broken or tied, and who knows how
many more will be found:

Anthony, Tony, “TD,”
“Hawk” Dorsett, scoring his first
touchdown of the day, shattered
the all-time Pitt record for career
touchdowns—30 by Andy Hast-
ings, 1914-19,. and George McLar-
en, 1915-18.

Dorsett carried 21 times for 268
yards, breaking his own school
record of 265 yards set two years
ago against Northwestern.

The total Pitt offense was 610
yards, which shattered the old
mark of 577 set in 1929 against
Duke. _

Pitt’s total rushing yardage (530)

also broke the old record of 468, set
against Duke in ’29.

Dorsett tied the record for most
TD’s in one game with four.

Carson Long tied the record for
most extra point in one game with
seven. -

This was the ﬁrst time since 1929
a Pitt team scored 50 or more
points on consecutive weekends.

Pitt took the opening kickoff,
wasting no time running in for the
score. On 14 plays, 13 on the
ground, quarterback Robert Hay-
good took the Panthers to the Army
six, from where Elliot Walker, who
rushed for 107 yards, bulled in for
the score. Long made t seven-zip
with 7:54 in the ﬁrst quarter.

Following a strong rush by the
defensive line, Army quarterback
Leamon Hall threw a hurried pass
to Pitt safety Dennis _Moorhead,

Three plays later Dorsett picked up
his second TD, 20 yards up the
middle, and the ﬁrst quarter
ended, 14-0. .

“We through their quarterback
Hall did a tremendous job,”
Majors said. “Their wishbone gave
us trouble all afternoon.”

-Indeed, as they Vopened the

V second quarter, the Cadets looked

entirely different. Taking over on
its own 30, Army moved the ball
steadily on the strength of Hall’s
arm and the running of fullback
Tony Pyne.

With a second and 10 at the Pitt
23, Hall hit split end Don Briggs for
a touchdown, causing many to
wonder if the Cadets indeed were

ﬁred up for homecoming.

  Steelers SwatBears

BY YAIER LEHRER

No one can say the Chicago
Bears didn’t try when they played
the Steelers yesterday at Three
Rivers stadium, but trying hard
was just not good enough, as the
Steelers handled the Bears with as
much ease as they would swatting a
bothersome ﬂy, beating Chicago,
34-3.

The Bears came out hitting hard
from the opening kickoff and
appeared to have caught the
Steelers napping when they drew
ﬁrst blood with a Bob Thomas ﬁeld
goal. The Bears ran the ball right
through the Pittsburgh defensive
line, averaging 6.3 yards a canyon
their ﬁrst and, as it turned out, only
scoring drive of .the game. ,

“We might become the only
team in NFL. history to be ﬁrst in
defensing against the rush one year
and drop down to last place the
next,” said Andy’Russell after the
game._

The Steel Curtain had difﬁculty
with Chicago's running attack all
afternoon. Mike Adamle and Ron
Harper, both" reserve running
backs, rambled for 196 yards.

While the Bears rambled in the
ﬁrst half, the Steelers found the
going.roughV.against a young but
tenacious Chicago defense. The
Pittsburgh running backs netted 37
yards_in the ﬁrst half and it was
only a few good breaks that .got the

. Steelers onto the. scoreboard.

. With a fourth down and three,
the Steelers sent in punter Bobby
Walden, who passed to Donnie
Shell for 10 yards, keeping alive -a

. drive that culminated in a 37-yard
Roy‘ Gerela ﬁeld goal that put .

Pittsburgh on the scoreboard for
the ﬁrst time.

The key play on the next drive .
was a pass interference. call on

Nehemiah Wilson at the Bear

pass. Two plays later Reggie

Harrison took it over for the

touchdown.

“You can’t play like we played in
the ﬁrst half and survive in the
NFL,” said Steeler Head Coach
Chuck Noll after the game. “We
made a lot of mistakes in keeping in
the guys with slight injuries in the

game. They couldn't perform up to

par." - _ _
By slightinjuries, Noll ‘meant the

nagging injuries to Franco Harris
and Rocky Bleier he believes keeps
the dynamic duo from playing up to
its full potential. This may be true;
the Harris-Bleier combination
managed to pick up 85 yards. At
the end of the ﬁrst half, Harris had
run for a .7 average.

While the Harris-Bleier team did
not fare so well, the Bradshaw-
Lynn Swann connection fared
exceptionally well. Swann pulled
down four passes for 62 yards.

There was also bad news for the
Steelers’ receiving corps‘ after the
game. Frank Lewis injured himself
during the game and joined John
Stallworth on the Steelers’ injured
list.

“We may have to put in either
(Joe) Gilliam or (Terry) Hanratty to
catch-passes if -any more of our
receivers get injured,” said Noll
jokingly. “We had them running
patterns in practice last week.”

Despite the problems of the
receiving corps, Garret pulled
down two passes to highlight a ﬁeld
goal drive on the Steelers’ ﬁrst
possession of the second half, and

 -“Like O.J. Simpson says, the
more he carries the ball the better
he gets. But we have a lot of great
backs here and we have a lot of

, potential. The coaches have to give
_'the ball to other people and keep
_i them happy, too.”

‘Dorsett admits that during the

I ﬁrst two years he had some degree

of difficulty making it to the

A ' practice field.

“The first two years here, very

seldom ‘did you see me practicing
on Monday or

Tuesday or
Wednesday,’ he explained,

speaking slowly and quietly. “I’d

.“This year I haven’t missed a

practice because I’ve been healthy.

much, but then again we’re

executing much better and I’m

protected.

“I took a little pounding my ﬁrst
year and last year I sort of paid for
what I did my first year.”

The beating he took that year did
pay off;he became the first
freshman in history to be named
first team all-American, and it
quickly propelled him into the
national spotlight. Perhaps the only
personal achievement Dorsett has
yet to attain is the Heisman Trophy
award, which seems to be of more
direct concern to others than it is to
him.

“It’s not on my mind,” Dorsett
said. “It never was. You see, I set
goals every year. This past season I
made second team all-American so
my goal is to get back on top, be
ﬁrst team all-American and get
1,000 yards.

“I ﬁgure as long as I’m doing
these things my contention for the

Heisman trophy will take care of '

itself.’ ’

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette volleyball team
met Franklin & Marshall last year
in the regionals and won easily.
But if F&M was looking for

’ revenge last Friday night, it didn’t

find it here.

p About 50 faithful fans braved the
rain and treaded water up to Trees
Hall, dragging signs, clutching
kazoos, and praying for victory.
The Pantherettes didn’t disap-
point. '

Diane Zaken opened the scoring
in the first game, then Franklin &
Marshall retaliated, putting two
quick points on the board. Jamie
Andrews and Julie Richter com-
bined for six points.
Marshall tried to edge back,
narrowing the margin to 9-7, but
Zaken pushed the game out of
reach, scoring four points,-
Andrews and Mitzi Frye contrib-

 

Franklin & A

uted a point apiece for the final
score, 15-8.

Scoring started slowly in the
second game, with both teams
playing sloppily. Franklin -&
Marshall got the ﬁrst point‘ and
held onto the lead until Zaken
shoved Pitt into the forefront for
good, 3-2. Frye, in the best
offensive showing of the season,
scored eight straight points.
Andrews added a point and Debbie
Jones totaled the final three for the
15-3 win.

“We played like Pitt should
play,” said Pantherette Coach
Mary Kromer.

“They (Franklin & Marshall) are
basically a good team, but they just
seemed to lose their confidence.

I They got tight.

‘‘I would say it was a good
offensive game on our part.”

Cross CountryTeam
Runs Through Ohio U

The Pitt Cross-Country team
earned its fourth consecutive
victory by defeating Ohio Univer-
sity last Tuesday, 20-14. Pitt
runners took seven places in the
ﬁrst 10 of the dual meet.

Dave McDonald had a super day,
almost breaking the hilly six-mile
course record. However, he and
Mel Boyd had to retrace steps to
run the course within the official
boundary line. so the pair finished

fourth and third respectively.

Nick Martin took second behind
an Ohio University's runner’s
31:24. Terry Wile, Ron Wirick,
Tom Herrmann and Mark Studnicki
came in ﬁfth through eighth. Mike
McLaughlin and Bill Garver were
12th and 13th.‘

The next cross-country meet will
be the Kent State Invitational
Saturday.

Pantherettes Spike F&M, 15-8    

Kreeger offered no comments on
the game but praised the Panther-

‘ettes as “a very good team--hard

hitters and good serving.”

The Pantherettes, now 5-0 for
the season, will participate in a
tri-meet in Clarion tomorrow, and
will take on Duquesne here
Thursday at seven.

effort despite the mud,” Majors
said. “Tony’s performance was
excellent. He’s been running
better these last few weeks and
especially running north and south
(parallel to the line of scrimmage)
better than ever.”

Majors did believe the game was
hard fought despite the score.

“It entered my mind only once to
pull the entire ﬁrst team from the
game. I’ve never had that luxury as
a head coach and possibly never
will, but that Army team was
hitting just as hard in the last
minute of the game as they were in
the first.”

What about Dorsett, who has a
chance to be named offensive back
of the week?

“I’m very. pleased with my
individual record but our whole
offense is improving,” he said. The
line was ﬁring" out better in this
game and the downﬁeld blocking
was tremendous. As far as records
(Dorsett had a chance to break the
yards rushing record of 294 this

year), the coach makes all the"

decisions. I could have stayed ir
but it was his ruling and I obeyec
it.99 ‘
