Congress Fires Blast at News

For Degrading School Spirit

Student Congress. blasted
the “attitude” of The Pitt
News Monday, and voted to
send a letter of protest to be

written by President Cyril

Wecht.

On the recommendation of Sam
Shapiro, athletic committee rep-
resentative, Congress will write
to the News, “encouraging them to
bolster school spirit, not degrade
it.”

Shapiro Makes Motion

The motion by Shapiro arosei

out of protest among members of
Congress against a column by
News Sports Editor Don Murdock
which appeared Oct. 10. The col-
umn, according to Shapiro, was
detrimental to school spirit. Ac-
cording to WSGA president Nancy
Tear, the story “gave you a feel-
ing of complete kaput”
(Objections seem to have
arisen from Murd0ck’s statement
last week that “Casualties (of the
Pitt-Indiana game) were a sud-
den drop in school spirit and an
almost certain collapse of plans
for a student train to East Lans-
ing, Michigan, for the Pitt-Mich-
igan State encounter.”)
Milletary Disapproves
Disapproving of the measure,
Don Milletary, assembly commit-
tee chairman- protested, “We’re
getting‘”pantywaist in here——you
can expect that from a, newspa-
paper. We can’t stop them from
saying what they want to say.”

be reproduced by WDTV at a

It will be held from 2:30 to 4:40
p.m. next week in the Stephen
Foster Memorial social room. A

According to Dr. Albert B. Mar-
tin, assistant professor of p.olit-
ical science and faculty advisor to
the model Security Council, “The
session here will be as much like
a regular Security Council session
as possible.”

The program will be presented

EX-Allderice , Gridder Mixes Job

As Cop With Social W

By ISABEL LUBOVSKY

At 4 p.m. when most students are getting home and pre-

paring for dinner, Robert McNertney, a Pitt graduate student,
is patrolling traffic in Squirrel Hill.

The husky sociology student has been a policeman for

‘ over two years.

As- a youngster he never had
any ambitions of being a law of-
ficer even though his father was
a captain on the force. He just
thought it would be a good job,
took the civil service examination
in 1949, and passed.

. Surprises Teachers
To his former Allderdice High

‘School teachers Oﬁicer McNertney

must be a surprise.

If they had been asked, they
would most likely have said, “Mc-
Nertney will end up with the law,
but the exact opposite of a pro-
tector of the law.”

As McNertney puts it——“I caus-
ed a lot of trouble and grief in
high school. I did everything from
playing truant to heckling my
teachers.”

McNertney, however, stopped
being truant so he could play foot-
ball for Allderdice. His football
career was successful." He became
captain of the team and was vot-
ed “most valuable player.”

But without McNertney even be-
ing conscious of it, the football
coach, Robert Irvin, was not only

coaching him in football but was.

also being the most important
single factor in straightening him
out.

Appreciates Irvin

It wasn’t until he was in the air
force, after a year at Miami Uni-
versity' that McNertney realized
how much Coach Irvin had done
for him.

According to the 29-year old
ofﬁcer-student, “Mr. Irvin was
probably the only person that
thought I had any potentialities.
He treated me as an adult and in-
dividual.

When discharged from the army
in 1949 he entered Duquesne Uni-

7l’itIi Us or Against Us?

Ticket sales for the Michigan State special student train

‘ now stand at 117 or 238 short of the necessary 400. If sales

   

do not take adecided spurt this week and next the train

will be cancelled. . p
, A similar special train to the University of Pennsylva-
nia failed dismally in 1949, but theone to Notre Dame last
‘ year was an overwhelming success. In 1949 Pitt piled up ~

11 good record; last year we did a little less than good.
Obviously students went to Notre Dame not to cheer
Pitt but to Watch the Irish play. They didn’t ride the train
to Philadelphia because it was easily reached by auto. So
it seems that the quality of our team has little to do with

‘ the success or failure of special train-projects.

The really deciding factor in such a project is the sup-
port it is given by the student body, especially those groups
which are organized. Student Congress, WSGA and the fra-
ternities are probably the best organized and most active
groups on campus. '

So far Congress and WSGA have been behind the pro-
ject. But there has been no public expression of support-

from the fraternities. IF Council has not organized a way _
by which the fraternities can throw, their complete support .

behind the project. »
In fact, one fraternity has chartered a bus to take 37
of its members up to Michigan at 12 dollars per man.

‘ They will pay $3.60 for their game ticket so they are not

saving any money. _
, This leaves 19 other fraternities to support the trip. If
they can get/an average of 15 men from each frat to go‘

' on the trainit will pull out on time. If they charter any

more buses the train will assuredly not go. V.
IF Council at its meeting tonight should point out that

e the train is a University function, similar to an ‘all-school

dance. No fraternity schedules a dance on the same night
as an all-school dance. Which is most important: going to

'a dance which proves‘ nothing or going upto Michigan

._ and supporting’ the steam?

 
 
 

  
   
 
 
 
    
      
     
     

   
    
  
   

raw

Not only should IF point this out, they should take
some formal action expressing their disapproval of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon bus trip. , -

Fraternities are traditionally the rock upon which
school spirit and student activities rest here at Pitt. The
rock seems to be crumbling.

 why students Don't eirickeis 

Everybody expects a lot from 'college students.

And when a student doesn’t know the answers
to the Korean mess, or, better yet, doesn’t get into
a “movement” that knows the answers ‘to the
Korean mess or into a party that just despises
“government by crony’_’ people are kind of disap-
pointed. _ ‘

And people get . bitter when.-

 

on fraternity row, and hear th
laughter and the music, and
learn of such innocent deception
as a campus organization not re
porting a party to the Univer
sity social committee, b_ecaus
the truth of the matter is it’
a beer party.

Then these bitter folk hea    
about frostbite in Korea, and they cant square it
with what Chancellor Fitzgerald likes to call “a
crackling ﬁre in.the Commons Room.”

Lets Buy the Steelers

With the frightful spectre of -a barren football
season taking shape, the indignant noises made
bythe rah-rah. boys over lack of student support‘
for the team may already be heard.

And some pf the more heated arguments you
hear these days are concerned with the much
kicked around subject of school “spirit. I

iOne contention is that every
one in school should stand ﬁrm
ly behind the football team,f
cheering their lungs out after'
every play, good or bad, and
showering the players with ap-
preciation even after a crushing
defeat. Anyone who fails to do
doesn’t deserve to live.

On Wrong Track ‘ j

The idea is an admirable one,  .

Why do they stay in college, then,
enlisting? Not because they feel their
essential to the future welfare of man.

   

and those who hold to ‘it should get lots of credit.\>
' But they are so foolish in thinking that by shout-

ing “school spirit”, all over the place they can stir
it up in others. Lamentable as it may be, student
enthusiasm will stay at a low ebb until “we get
a winning team. ’ " . ,

School spirit, the collegiate version of esprit
de corps, can only be fostered by a feeling of pride
in an object or institution closely identiﬁed with
the university. Obviously, then, a campus object
or institution worthy of student pride is a prime

.. necessity. —

It doesn’t mean much, it seems, that we hold

forth within the walls of an architectural tour de —

ENROUTE FROM IOWA CITY—You would think the 1.
Panthers saw enough ‘I’s" before their eyes after Indiana and
Iowa handed them a pair of defeats. » 
But apparently Frank Leahy doesn’t think so. Pitt will
face at least one more ‘I’ when the Fighting Irish from South

Incidently, Pitt now decides

Leahy’s huddle.

step, in 116 particular order.

The ‘I’ formation, though, is
not a Leahy brainstorm. It orig-
inated several years ago at Vir-
ginia Military Institute. Several
Southern schoolsborrowed the ‘I’
but it took the Irish to ﬁx the of-
fense in the public eye.

Against Southern Methodist,
Notre Dame’s conqueror last week,
27-20, the Irish scored their ﬁrst
touchdown from the ‘I’. It came
when Paul Reynolds-—the dot in

for 26 ‘yards. _

Along with the standard T,
Leahy used the ‘I’ successfully
against Indiana and Detroit.

Sports Editor ,

ENROUTE FROM IOWA CITY—The Iowa Hawkeyes
got into the act last Saturday afternoon when they defeated
the Panthers, 34-17. The Blue-and—Gold loss marked’ No.

The loss was the tenth in the
last 11 played by the Panthers.
But the way most of this year’s

‘squad and coaching staff have
worked to break into the win
column it would be‘ a misjus-
tice_ to criticize the board of
strategy or its‘ team personnel. '

* >l= =l~‘
In fact two of Iowa’s regulars

.l1ad nothing but praise for the

Jungle Cats. Arnie Caplan, a
senior end, said, “Pitt hit hard and

fast, and their timing was terriﬁc,

but they lagged down. I thought
sure we were gonersin the third
quarter. Your best lineman is No.
.73 (Bob Brennen). Boy was he in
that ball game up to his neck.
John Towner, Hawkeye center,
added, “They were much tougher
than Purdue.” (Purdue licked the
Hawks, 34-30). — -

Hawkeye coach Len Raﬂ‘ens-
berger commented after the
game, “That was not too good a
football game. We were spotty.
We looked worse on defense than
I expected. Our running game
should be much more consistent.
,I still don’t exactly realize that
We scored 34 points.

footed halfback, who was a thorn

~ in‘ the Panthers side all afternoon,

picking up 104 yards in eight plays,
Showed more concern over the
pass he dropped about 15 yards
behind the Pitt secondary in the
_ﬁrst frame.

 He said, “I lost the ball in the

sun. Sure would have. liked to

catch the measly thing.”

Williams threatened to quit the

to show up at several practice ses-
sions, but was reinstated at the last
moment by coach Raﬁensberger.

The same spotty pass defense
that defeated Pitt’s varsity plagued
the Frosh-JV eleven in ‘ their
on

~The Middies were held to a
standstill by Pitt’s rugged line, but
took to the airlanes to score ﬁve
‘buchdowns and trounce the Jun-
gle Cubs, 39-6.

Instrumental in the Cub’s defeat

was Tom Hamilton Jr., son of the

Panther coach. Young Hamilton,

who quarterbacked at Shadyside
Academy last year, hit his re-
ceiver in the end‘ zone for the
ﬁnal'Navy Tally.

Pitt’s lone score came with two
minutes remaining in the ﬁrst half
on ‘a screen pass from quarterback
Rudy Mattioli to fullback Bill

Hoffman, who romped 21 yards’
behind excellent blocking for the!

touchdown.

Coach Ernie Hefferle substituted
freely after the Plebes had amass-
ed a 25-6 lead. Almost every
player of the 34—man squad saw
some action.

Talking to several Iowa students
before the game in an informal _in-

lowing remarks made by them
about Pitt’s schedule. .
A commercial student: “Pitt
could never be undefeated. It
would take a miracle to be up for
every game. Maybe an All—Amer-
ican outﬁt could tackle it.” An-
other student said, “The boys
should be given a helluva _lot of

say: “If Iowa had that schedule

there.”

Spanish art reﬂects- one of the most exciting countries
in the world, according to Walter Read Hovey, head of the

Department of Fine Arts.

Professor Hovey, who spent the summer viewing the

Health Prof Speaks

"Dr; Minnie L. Lynn, director of
health and physical education for
women at Pitt was the keynote
speaker at the_ Missouri State Fed-
eration of College Women at
Washington University, ‘St. Louis,

Dr. Lynn addressed delegates in
the opening general session on the
topic, “Sports Memo to College
Women.”

9 panish Arthe discusses in many

of his classes was impressed with
the country’s beauty and ‘wealth.

He waselikewise dismayed with
the poverty and backwardness of
the poor classes. 1

No .Middle Class

Profesor Hovey explained that
in Spain there is no “middle class.”
The rich and the poor live in
close proximity, with old world
practices and modern methods be-
ing maintained simultaneously.

Professor Hovey statesthat the
highlight of his whole tour was at
the Monastery at Guadelupe, one
of the few remaining monaster-
ies in the world to retain its or-
iginal -treasures. _

The monastery, located. in the
western part of the country,‘ is
one of the most isolated spots in
the world. He told of traveling
by train, private car, and bus be-
fore reaching it.. ‘ *

Rich in art treasures the mon—_
astery\ ‘contains two museums. It
is still maintained .by the monks
of the original order that found-
ed it many centuries ago.

Stopped at Orapesa

Another of Professor eHovey’s
stops was’ at Orapesa Castle in
Gartera, Spain. The castle is a
combination of Old World and
New, modernized only by the ad--
dition of electricity and plumbing.-
Everything else is maintained
much the -same as it was V during
1402 when the Castle was built
by_Henry III.
