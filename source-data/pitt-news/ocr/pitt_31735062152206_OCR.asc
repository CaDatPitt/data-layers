Emil jannings ‘Gives Sensitive _Portrayal As Doorman In

‘The Last Laugh,’ G‘ertrian,Movie That First Used

‘Moving Camera,’ Swinging Crane

- Movies shown at the second pro-
gram of German ﬁlms, sponsored by
the department of ﬁne arts Thurs-
day night, were ro,preseiitative of the‘
grc-pahadvancement over the primitive
films of 1896 shown previously.

Emil Jannings. in “The_ Last
Lang. ,” produced in 1.924, gave one
of the sensitive performances that
endeare‘d him to audiences of the day.
His portrayal of the old hotel door-

and stronger man, was typical of the
sentimental roles t-hat ma.de him fa-
mous both in America and in Europe.

_The old doorman, broken by his
sudden loss, which drainatically oc-
curs’ on the day of his daughter’s
wed-ding, steals the uniform taken
from him, and pretends to his family
and friends that all is well. l_Iowever,
he is _discovered in his deceit the next
day and the news is spread through-
out the neighborhood by the conven-
tional "gossipers. A

1924 niovies, liowevcr, it is vastly su-
perior to other ‘films of the day. If

cation Committee will inform fresh-
menabout fraternities and ru;;hing
rules. They will also be given cop-
ies of O Philos, the oflici-al Pa-nhcl-~
lenic publication which gives detailed
information about fraternities and
about deferred rushing.

The official -rushing rules will be
published in a later edition.

Univ-ersitpy -History Reveals Friendship  

The friendship of a Roman Catho-
lic priest and a pious founder of the
United Presbyterian Church in West-
ern Pennsylvania during an age long-
believed full of intolerance, has been
brought to light by historians pre-
paring a record of the 150 years in
anticipation of the University’s cele-
bration of its sesquicentennial.

Father Charles B. Maguire, pastor
of St. Patrick’s Church and profes-
sor of modern languages at Pitt, then
the Western University of Pennsyl-
vania, was the priest. The Protestant
‘pastor was Rev. Robert. Bruce, prin-
cipal of the“ University from 1822 to
1843. - '

Father Maguire was born in
County Tyrone, Ireland, in 1768, and
was graduated from~Louvaine Uni-
versity in France. Rev. Bruce" was
born in Scotland, and was graduated
from the University of..Ediubui'gh-.
~. Together, they brought to "little
Western University, only raised from
its status as ‘an academy in 181-9,
t.lie“'t'radit.ion' —of Old VVorld learning.

Father Maguircf. was Pittsburgh’s

Documentary proof of his wit, she
found, exists in the baptismal and
‘rnarriage record book of St. Patrick’s:

pastor of the Reformed Presbyterian
Church, Father Maguire, steered the

then had only two other men on its

in there were,,as now, only a few houses solidly

interested in the old council’s future. The “old

, coalition” had a “free hand,” and still the sit-
.-uation was much like it is today. Those few
- houses elected council officers and chairmen by
‘ a ‘strict spoils system. A few houses prospered

to some extent. All, however, struggled for
perpetuation. A few houses then, as now, monop-
olized the athletic honors. It seems that the old
adage, “Like attracts like,’.’ was as prevalent then
as now. The same houses Won scholarship
awards,‘ then, as now. Pledging, then, was much
as it is today. Today’s pledge leaders are vir-

:, tually the same'as they were in that ‘_‘group-

controlled” period.

Therefore, it seems that whether or not a house

.l'ias co-chairman of Interfraternity Conference,
. or chairman of, favors for the Interfraternity
'1"-'Bal_l,.has little vital effect on the perpetuation

ofthat chapter.’ .
. Last year the boys decided to vote by “mem-

ber”-—‘that is, each fraternity man had one vote.

It was then brought to light that six whole
houses held the upper hand over the other seven,

_ controlling a majority-of the vote. So, the seven

houses, a majority in the actual council voting
by “chapter,” adjourned, and therefore there was
no quorum to do business. That deadlock threat-
ened the very existence of I-F Council. A hasty
compromise meeting was called, and then began
a split that was to give each and every house
its just due. How lovely it all was! . . .

What has council done this year? Nothing
more than ‘it did the year before, or the year
before, etc. That is not the issue. Perhaps

, undergraduates in “responsible” positions should

do nothing more than a “rubber-stamp” job in

their respective capacities. It is hard to be ere-_

ative in the’ job of ruling over a group of men.
But there is- a definite opportunity to work with
men. Why decide Interfraternity Council jobs
by this Sunday—School method of distributing
the lollypops, or chocolate cones? Why not
‘put up the issue to a vote on the qualiﬁcations
of the men who are to direct the destinies of our

, Interfraternity group? The present system only

makes the Greeks weaker in their increasing
struggle for survival.

Tomorrow night I-F Council meets for its an-
nual squabble over election procedure. And it
probably Won't be long until they’re picking
their leaders out of a hat. A .. -

A. Cooperative Bookstore

HREE WEEKS AGO a group of Pitt stu-
dents met and discussed the possibilities of

starting a Cooperative Book Store at the Uni-
versity. Since that..,time the movement has ac-
quired momentum to the extent that now the
leaders of many important Activities on campus
have either actively supported or shown an in--
terest in the ‘Bookstore Coop. _

The purpose of the Cooperative Book Store

is threefold: _

1. To save the students money on new books;

2. To educate the students in the cooperative
movement!

3. To give students, especially those in the
School-of Business Administration, practi-
cal experience in conducting a business ven-
ture. - - .- 

 ‘At present the Cooperative Club is an inde-

pendent ‘student organization consisting of a fed-
eration of all types of campus activities, and
plans soon to go through the process of becoming

a recognized group.

The Cap ‘and Gown Committee vetoed all of the

result, G. Norman Reis, ’16, and Nick Spanos, ’38,
have been assigned to collaborate on a story with a
campus pl-ot._ Spanos was co-author of “Out for the

C&G plays. This year’s show_ will be presented either
the week of the 19th or the 26th of April.

Some System

Your blueprint grades were printed by the Dietzgen
(30-_ Of Liberty Ave. In one year they make 30,000
copies of the ﬁnalreckonings for about 6,500 University
students. Beginning at 8:30 o’clock Saturday morning,
January 29, and_ ﬁnishing yesterday at 6:30 o’clock,
that concern printed 11,500 grade reports for the
school. The blueprint idea of recording grades was
started here in 1927 by John G. Quick, registrar. Pitt
was one of the ﬁrst schools in the country to use that
system. Since then, over 50 per cent of the colleges
have adopted the blue and white reproduction method.

One of the ﬁles in the 1-cgistrar’s oﬂice contains
75,000 index cards with the names of every person
registering at Pitt since 1912. Other ﬁicsliave’ records
dating as far back as 1870. Every safe, cabinet and

OLITICA

 P ........... Li

l By William Stark ‘

Things have been happening fest
ind furious during the last few days.
The outstanding political move was
"hat of President Roosevelt in which
he caused a major furor in Washing‘
on circles by asking C°“gl'e5.§ t0 "*3:
vise the Federal judiciary. As was
expected, cries of_ “dictator,” “set-
-ing precedent” and the like have
1(:‘.(’ll raised. ‘ _
- Although conservative phrase-more
Te1's may have the advantage of
'i.igh-sounding phra.s:es on their side,
:.hey do notlnecessarily have supre-.me
season, Wash-ington, Jef‘r'ers.on, Jack-
son‘, and "I‘hcodorc‘ Roosevelt all
"ward the same arguments that our
_)resent President is hearing, but as
.-olumnist (.‘.-lapper says, “times out of
Eoint are not set right by irresolute,
:oliloquizing' political Hamlets."

General Johnson also scores a
strike when he says, "We can’! -
wreck our Constitutional system of
property rights against the recalci-
trance ‘of the 25 per cent of us
who are so rocky rugged that they
don't know the blasting crew when
they see it coming." .

‘One of the smartest moves that

we have heard in‘ some time con‘-. .-
‘ cerns the University’: own Dr. 
VVarren Madden, who temporarily
dropped his duties as chairman of
the National Labor Relations Board‘
to defend the Wagner Labor Relta-l
tions Act before the Supreme Court
in the Jones and Laugblin case.
Quoting directly from P|'¢Vl°“l.
Supreme Court decisions on the
"flow of commerce" theory, Dr.‘
Madden clearly bested Justice
Sutherland in their friendly dia-
logue." -

J. Stanley Reed. U. S. Solicitor
General, assisted Madden, and argued
for ‘the rightfof the NLRB to hear
complaints against employers’ in’
fringement of the riighit of workers
to organize.  ’

It is our opinion that General
Motors “took it on the chin” in the
recent strike. After GMC had inten-
tionally perpetrated the strike, be-
fore the union was ready, both sides
seemed to settle to a. long siege, with
only one purpose in mind-~-to save
their individual faces. This purpose
has been accomplished, seemingly
favorable to both sides. '

The United Ant-oniob.ile Worker's
Union has secured exclusive recogni-

 
 

ration of that t._ii_ne, xvi‘-ll have orga-
nizeil a majority of the auto workers.
General Motors has secured evacua-
tion of its plants, and now sets its
in~ac.hi1n-iii’ to work to g'P.t in at tlie
tail—end of the seasonal auto-purchas
ing rush. John L. Lewis, Governor
.\/Iurphy of Michigan,

Knudsen deserve great credit for
their ‘ splendid statesmanship. All
maneuvered with great skill. All

seemed to be satisﬁed with the re-
sults, and now are eager to settle
down to six months of industrial
peace.

Classieal Banquet
- Set For Thursday

 

On the night of the 12th day be-
fore the Kalends of March, at the
11th hour, unusually garbed persons
will gather to pay homage to Jupiter,
king of gods, and to Pen-ates and
l..-ares, gods of the household.

In plain English: on Thursday eve-
ning, February 18, at 5 o’clock, the
Univcisity Classical Club will hold its
lftoman banquet at Heinz House.

Although ﬁeld mice, :3. traditional
Roman delicz-1(‘_'v, will not be served,
the banqiiet will be composed entire-
ly of the favoi-itc-. dishes of the

tain guests, as the spirit moves them,
will act,‘ju~ggle, wri3s.r.le, and recite
poetry spontaneously. ‘ ’

All prospective baiiquetcrs are
-warned that the wearing of Roman
dress is a coiidition of‘ attendance.
The gentlemen may borrow a sheet
somewhere, while the ladies may
come attired in their best nightio:-—if
they wish.

They’re making quite a noise over
a5 boy by the name of Harry Evans.
those Pitt swimmers are, and they
have a reason. For in Harry Evans
Pat Corr has the fulﬁllment of his
wildest dream and desire —- a fresh-
man diver. "

For three months, ever since swim?
ming practice began, Corr has»l1ad‘—,the'>
“Wa~.nted_”‘ sign for. fresh diver‘s,.hang‘- .

bad, that freshnian coach Russ ~I>ind="-

freestyle -swimmer, up on- the board
and when Jim Lalor is-sent up to do
fancy diving, they certainly are hard‘.
up for divers.‘ _ ; .

But- Lalor won"t h_ave to "do any
more diving because- Evans will lie:
doing the yearling hoardwork. 'from_
now on. The ladwho gets the cigar
