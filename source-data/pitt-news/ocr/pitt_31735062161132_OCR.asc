UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Tenure unavailable for one-third of profs

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

At least one-third of all full-
time faculty members at Pitt will
never be eligible to receive tenure.

“More and more professors are
being hired outside of the tenure
stream,” said Professor Philip
Wion, head of the United Faculty
Unionf’ “And this is very
dangerous.”

Wion explained that without
“enure or the possibility of tenure,

ome professors are overly
cautious about what they do and
say because they are afraid of
being fired by the university.

He said that some faculty
members are reluctant to speak
up and that if they had tenure
they’d be free to say what they
want without fear of termination.

According to the faculty
handbook distributed by the
university, the purpose of tenure
is to assure a professor the
“autonomy and freedom of

inquiry required for the university
to7carry out its mission [and] to

.‘”‘;sure the university that there

‘ Veniamin F. Yakolev discussed govermental

ill be continuity in its
erienced faculty and in the
ictions for which they are

responsible.” “With tenure a
professor has job security. He
can’t be fired except under very
unusual circumstances,” Wion
said. .

According to Wion, the

university may be hiring people

6 outside of the tenure stream in

order to gain a greater ﬂexibility
within its teaching staff. He added,
however, that this is a poor reason
because there is already
considerable turnover within the

tenure stream, as many faculty
members retire each year.

Associate Provost Dr. Vijai Singh
said many universities hire outside
of the tenure stream and that this
is not a new practice to_Pitt.

“They can always apply to the
tenure stream if a position opens
up. Also, if they were afraid [of
being fired], they’d seek tenure
elsewhere,” he added.

He explained that professors
may be hired outside of the stream
if the university needs someone
for a short period of time, such as
when a permanent faculty
member takes a leave of absence.
He said that if one considers the
largeness of Pitt, the one-third is

‘not a lot.

Approximately 1,600 full—time
faculty members, (not including
those in the School of Medicine)
are presently outside of Pitt’s
tenure stream. Reading from the
University Fact Boole, Fall 1987,
Wion outlined the percentage of
professors in each school outside

of the tenure stream (see graph).

Wion said that he does not
know what type of person the
university is hiring outside the
tenure stream. He said, however,
that they could be people without
aPh.D. or another related degree.

Singh said that the professional
schools are more likely to have
faculty outside of the tenure

. stream because they tend to be

more research oriented. He
explained that faculty in the health
professions often get grants for a
finite amount of time and that
their contract with the university
will run out when the grant runs
out. ' /

Each tenured professor in the
appropriate department makes
his recommendation about
whether to grant tenure to a
colleague or not, Singh explained.

said. 1 ’
He added, however, that
research and frequency of
publication in scholarly journals
tends to weigh more heavily in
the decision over teaching skills.

be a better balance,” he said.

A tenured professor may be
released from the university
“under unusual circumstances”
such as in the case of a financial
crisis in the school, Wion said.
“But this is extremely rare.” 7

“To the best of my knowledge,
no tenured professor has been
fired since I’ve been here,” Singh
said. He came to the university in

1971.

According toSingh, if the dean’s
review of a faculty member’s
position is negative, that faculty
member may appeal the dean’s
decision to the provost’s office.

The United States and Soviet

A Minister of Justice Veniamin F.

Yakovlev said yesterday at a
Chautauqua plenary session.
“Nations arms themselves

separately, but they can only
F disarm together,” Yakovlev said.

Yakovlev appeared with
assistant secretary for human
rights and humanitarian affairs of
the U.S. State Department Richard
Schifter at the session entitled
“The Evolution of a Democratic
Society in the United States and
the Soviet Union.”

Schifter, who spoke first,

rights and democracy through a
type of history lesson, including
the background of the two
nations. '

evaluate the dean’s decision.
“The panel must recognize if
the decision made by the dean is
reasonable or not,” Singh said.
When as faculty member decides
to appeal the decision he may
seek the advice ofthe University
Senate Tenure and Academic
Freedom Committee. The
committee’s purpose is to “give

advice and help” to those who‘

want to know how to file an
appeal, said Sanford Golin, co-
chairman of the committee. It
will also help to resolve grievances
from faculty on problems of
harassment of any type.

“A fair number of people come
to us for help,” he said:

Government officials compare democratic evolution

“In 1776, under the winning
words of Thomas Jefferson, the
[American] colonies declared their
independence,” he said.

He went on to discuss America’s F

Declaration of Independence and
the Bill of Rights, including such
historical figures as Abraham
Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and
john Locke.

Schifter claimed that the United
States has come a long way from
the periods of absolute
monarchies in the 16th and 17th
centuries to a modern democratic
society. He continued by saying
that although the United States
had inherited distress from the
institution of slavery, we have
overcome the bulk of our
problems.

“As far as government and
society is concerned, I believe
that [the United States] has tried
its very best to establish equality,

Religious leaders cite theology as way to peace

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

The role of religion in
contemporary society was the
focus of a discussion between
Soviet and U.S. religious leaders
yesterday. ‘

Rabbi Jose ph H. Levine, director
of the B’nai B’rith Hillel
foundation at the University of
Pittsburgh, spoke from a U.S.
perspective on the role of religion
here. Levine said, “We face
the challenge of the free and
open society. We face this
[problem] as a promise and a
challenge. “

“Greater Judaism is now in the
making. We hope that our future
is as bright as our past. During
the ’30s, the trend was lforJewish

people] not to stand out. Now the *

task is to help the future of the
Jewish community to appreciate
its past.” ,
Dr. Carnegie S. Calian, president
of the Pittsburgh Theological
Seminar spoke on the roles of
religious institutions, religious

pluralism and U.S.S.R. exchanges.

Calian said, “Religious
institutions are a significant factor
in society. The churches
themselves must take a stand.
We live in a creative world without
boundaries.”

He also said that he was glad

that the United States and the

Soviet Union could have this
peaceful exchange.

“Religious institutions can foster
further dialogue between the two
countries,” Calian said.

He also said that this future
dialogue could be achieved by
supporting each other and making
progress known,
exchanges and encouraging
conferences, widening
perspectives and promoting grass
roots exchanges.

Poierkov Vladimir K. Yuvenalii,
metropolitan of Krutitsy and
Kolomna, spoke about the
mission of the Soviet churches.
Yuvenalii said, “Our mission was
to lay the foundation of the
Russian Orthodox church.

“We want to share the

developing

experience of ou: church [with
others]. Now is not the time to
celebrate, it is the time to work.
We need to realize all the
realities.”

Yuvenalii said that intensive
legislation involving religion is
now taking place in the Soviet
Union, and that the state opens
opportunities for the church.

He also said that churches are
in the process of being restored,
and that many people are
receiving religious training for
the churches.

In comparing religious
systems, Yuvenalii said, “We
have religious problems [in the
U.S.S.R.]. We were surprised that
the Americans mentioned only
one problem —- the Jewish
problem.

“We take to heart the problems
of society in general. We’d like
to heal the wounds in the body
of society.” . v

The problem of substance
abuse has no international
boundaries, U.S. and Soviet
medical experts agreed atthe
Tuesday morning plenary
session on the medical and
social aspects of drug and
alcohol abuse in the 19903.

Soviet speakers included
two experts from the All—Union
Research Center of Medical
and Biological Problems of
Alcoholism and Drug
Addiction, Nikolai N. Ivanets,
director, and Irina P.
Anokhina, deputy scientific
director.

Substance abuse does cross borders

Ivanets said that the purpose of
the All—Union Research Center is
the prevention and cure of
alcoholism and drug dependency.
The center works closely with
two U.S. institutes, the National

Institute of Alcoholism and the

National
Addiction.

According to Ivanets, there are
appioximately 4.5 million
alcoholics and 6 1,000 drug addicts
in the Soviet Union.

In 1985, there was a
governmental decree in the Soviet
Union to combat the alcohol
problem, Ivanets said. The
purpose of the decree was to

Institute of Drug

change the attitude of each ‘

individual and to make it more

difficult to obtain alcohol.
Ivanets said that the
production and sale of alcohol
has decreased, as well as the
number of alcohol-related
deaths.

Youths with drug addictions
are of great concern, he said,
adding that  main reasons
why youths use drugs are peer
pressure and to improve their
emotional state. They get their
drugs off the streets or produce
them themselves, and get
most of their information about
drug production from
television and movies.

irrespective of ethnic
background,” said Schifter.

»He added that although the

U.S. has not solved all of its
problems, they are signiﬁcantly
less than those of the Soviet Union.

According to Schifter, the
citizens of the West are given
legal and civil rights. The citizens
of the Eastare presented with
economic and social rights, but
they maintain an interest in
Western rights.

“When the people of the Soviet
Union have had the chance to
express their views through
election,” said Schifter, “they have
done so in favor of democracy
and human rights.”

He concluded by saying that

I the process of change in the

Soviet Union hasebeen by no
means completed-, but that the
progress in democracy has been
remarkable.

“Today. let us hope that the
Soviets achieve the life, peace,
andfreedom that has so long
eluded them,” Schifter concluded.

Yakovlev, a professor of law
from Western Siberia, began his
speech with the issue of human

rights. “We do not need a
supreme power, but instead a
supreme law, ensuring an
adequate life for every person,”
said Yakovlev. ' I .

He proceeded by saying that
the Soviet Legislature is aimed at
reaffirming the rights of Soviet
citizens and that the Soviet
Constitution enables the electoral
system to I become more
democratic.

There are Soviet legislative acts
underway relating to such things
as the common law of the citizens
and freedom of the mass media,
according to Yakovlev.

“We hope [that] our new
legislation will measure up to the
international standards,” said
Yakovlev. .

The new Soviet legislation also
includes overruling laws on land,
leasing and taxation. A: reliance
on these new laws will help in
Setting up a socialist market,
offering more opportunities for
individual enterprise and
entrepreneurs.

Said Yakovlev, “I think these
are major assets in our country
and should be preserved. We
will place more meaning on these

things, which means better»

performance of our economy.”

He went on to stress the
impossibility of judicial reform
unless the independent courts
are guided “solely” by the law.
These, he said, are guarantees of
protection for the Soviet people,
and will in turn ensure justice.

Yakovlev also claimed that the
criminal law of the Soviet Union
will be aimed toward greater
humanitarianism These changes
will help in reducing the number
of death sentences in the criminal
system. I

Although this system has not ‘

yet matured, Yakovlev claims that
many Soviets support the
abolishment of capital
punishment in their country.
Yakovlev concluded with an

‘outlook on future Soviet society.

“lThe Soviet’, Union] must be
ashamed somewhat of our past
history because we have relied
too much -on confrontation, but
new legislative acts are
underway.”

“Chautauqua has become very
symbolic. It is something we all
should treasure,” he concluded.

own culture.

Shaevich said, “We must know
our own culture before we
explore someone else’s. If we
don’t take action to promote
religion, there’s no future for us
[in the Jewish religion].

‘ “Education is necessary by
families and by tradition,”
Shaevich said. “We will have
many problems if we don’t
continue to teach [our religion to
our children].”

Shaevich said that the Jewish
temple has a lot to teach people,
and that they are hoping to build
a synagogue in the Soviet Union
to teach students in the ministry
instead of sending them abroad
to other countries for their
training.

“Charity has always been a
component of the church. It is
the task of religious communities
to care for the sick and hungry,”
Shaevich said.

’ Lack of teachers, literature and
space are many of the problems

facing the churches. At the next V

would like to speak not of the

accomplishments he has attained.

Archbishop Micardi spoke of
perestroika as a revolution for
religious freedom, and said that
he wants peace between the two
nations.

One question the panel
addressed from the audience dealt
with the availability of Bibles to
Russian citizens. Archbishop
Micardi said, “No religion is getting
any financial help from the
government. [However], religious
roots nurture values. Many

hundred thousand Bibles are’

available in Ukrainian.

“It is very difficult to get the

Yury Zanoshkin, Soviet

Kleber said that the drug war is a

government can not win the war

alone.

Kleber said that supply and
demand is an important part of
the drug problem, noting that
cocaine use in 1989 is nine times
higher than itwas in 1981, but the
use of marijuana has decreased
by 50 percent, even though there
is a high demand.

He also said that 37 percent of

Just days ago, Bush killed legislation restoring Medicaid
funding of abortions for poor women who became
pregnant through rape or incest.

crime in every other.

“The casual user is a role model
that gives the appearance that
you can have it all.”

An effort is being made to
crack down on the casual and
controlled user, Kleber said,
adding that the drug war needs to
be fought on a number of fronts,
including prevention and
treatment.

According to Kleber, education
in the schools, the workplace
and the community is the key to
prevention. He feels, however,
that education without a “firm

and fair policy” concerning drug

use is not sufficient.
There is a need to improve

I treatment, said Kleber, “It is clear

that treatment works. It is also
clear that treatment does not work
as well or as fast as we’d like.’’
Kleber said that improved post-
treatment patient evaluation of
drug addiction will help improve
treatment in the future. Kleber
concluded by saying that
legalization of drugs is an easy
and fast solution that would be a
disaster.

Anokhina said that the problem
of drug and alcohol abuse is
becoming more significant for all
of humanity.

People use drugs and alcohol
because they can simulate positive
emotions that are sometimes
difficult to experience under
normal conditions, according to
Anokhina. '

r Some experiments accepted

Does everyone agree that it is a step in the right
direction to work toward saving the lives of people with
life—threatening medical problems?

If the answer is yes, as most people would expect it to
be, then why is there such a resistance to the use of animal
experimentation which makes medical breakthroughs
possible? I . .

For example, the University of Pittsburgh recently made
one such breakthro_ugh toward prolonging the lives of

- patients who have received lung transplants. By experi-
menting with dogs, researchers found that certain antibi-
otics may protect recipients from pneumonia, which is a
major killer of lung transplant patients. I

If the promising results of the research upon dogs and
the four bumarz experimental subjects are any indication,
lung transplant patients may no longer be the quickest of
all organ transplant recipientsto die.

In order to test whether the drugs would work, the
researchers inoculated healthy dogs with pneumonia
bacteria and transplanted the infected lungs to other
dogs. They noticed that the healthy dogs did not develop

pneumonia,» however, the dogs with the transplanted,

infected lungs did. The ’ researchers then gave three
antibiotics to the donor dogs before the transplant, but
this time, recipients did not develop pneumonia.

Thus, if donors are given the antibiotics before they
donate the lung, the chance of the recipient developing
pneumonia after the transplant is minute.

This is not to say that researchers should be given afree
license to conduct any off-the-wall experiment that they
desire. There is no reason to torture or harm animals
merely to satisfy the curiosity of some scientist. However,

— whenanimal research can improve the lives of men,

women and children around the world, then it is not
wrong or cruel to do so.

This is not a lone example. Almost all of the major leaps
in medicine have been made possible through animal
experimentation. Instead of protesting the use of animals
in such research, mankind should be on their knees
thanking God that He has given us the means by which
we can help our species to survive.

If you have a gripe,
write a letter to the
  editor.

Are SoViet's new strides sincere

Skeptics of today’s global
consensus of ad more friendly,
Soviet Union contend that
Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of
glasnost‘ and perestroika are
nothing but a redolent, yet os-
tentatious, facade designed to
gain access to the economic
prosperity and technology of the

West. In that sense, the Red

V menace has adopted a friendly .

appearance merely to deceive
the West and exploit it for its
own benefit —— an exploitation
that unequivocally signifies a
more shrewd and still aggres-
sion-prone Soviet Union — erod-
ing the common belief of a less
aggressive Soviet Union.

Now, these critics are correct
in assuming that the Soviet Un-
ion is seeking reconciliation with
the West for its own technologi-
cal and economic benefits, and
that a more friendly Soviet Un-
ion is designed for and aimed at
these, goals. However, this
doesn’t necessarily make them
more militarily aggressive; after
all, you can't blame a militarily
powerful Superpower with an
inveterate Third World economy
for seekingnecessary economic
reforms.

What do constitute a threat
from the Soviet Union are eco-
nomic reforms, combined with
increasing military production
and continued billions of dollars
in economic and military sup-
port to Cuba, Nicaragua, Mozam-
bique, Angola, Ethiopia, Iran,
Libya, Syria, North Korea, Viet-
nam and “indirectly” to the FMLN
in El Salvador. This international

‘support and inﬂuence has been
benevolently and naively con-
doned by a euphoric West,
complacent about the mere fact
that glasnost and perestroika
reflect a more open and friendly
Soviet Union (Note: more open
and friendly doesn’t necessarily
mean less aggressive).

Although Gorbachev promised
a 14 percent reduction in the
Soviet military budget, a recent
U.S. Department of Defense
report states that the Soviet Un-
ion has increased defense spend-
ing at an annual rate of3 percent
over the last five years (during

which time U.S. defense spend-
ing has decreased by 11 percent).
The Warsaw Pact maintains a 16
to 1 missile advantage over NATO,
thanks to a Soviet modernization
program of short-range nuclear
missiles. The Soviets have added
more tanks and artillery pieces
since Gorbachev came into power
in 1985 than Great Britain, France
and West Germany combined.
And according to former Assis-
tant Secretary‘ of State Richard
Perle, Soviet military production
has increased to the point where
it has made up for weapons lost
through the INF treaty. ,
Once again, however, the
Soviet military threat was ignored

 

by the West when just last week

‘Gorbachev’s foreign minister

declared that the 1979 Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan was
immoral and illegal. Of course, in
response to this declaration,
cheers that the Cold War was
over rang throughout the giddy
American media. S

But if Sovietleadership feels so
terrible about the Afghanistan
invasion, then why do they con-
tinue to pump $300 million
monthly into their puppet regime
there? Why do they continue to

. airlift supplies to that regime in

an amount which is, according to
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, far larger than the 1949
Berlin airlift? Worse yet, why were
Soviet troops and weapons to
Afghanistan escalated from the
time of Gorbachev’s emergence
in 1985 until the Soviet with-
drawal in 1989?

If Gorbachev is so concerned
with military might, then why did
he agree to the Bush reduction
proposals for conventional arms
forces between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact? It comes down to
the fact that the two things hold-
ing the Eastern bloc and the Soviet
Union together — communism
and Soviet economic aid ‘—- are
both at the end of their ropes.

Furthermore, the Soviet troops in
the Eastern bloc countries have
served more as occupational
forces than defense forces —— a

new, friendly Soviet Union can’t

- afford that symbolically. Consid-
ering these facts, Gorbachev

would have no choice but to cut

them anyway.

Most importantly, and even
seemingly stunning, is that to-
day’s Soviet Union has allowed
Hungary and Poland to break
from communist doctrine for their
own economic salvations. How
can they allow these changes in

their sphere of inﬂuence which ’

they’ve always strongly con-
trolled? Well, realistically, Gor-
V bachevhas no alternative but to
allow these countries to take their
own course because a) he can’t
afford to rescue them economi-
cally, b) denying them opportu-
nities to reform would be a contra-
diction to his own revisionist
perestroika policies and c) if he
tries to stop them militarily, then
the claims of a more open and
friendly Soviet Union and Gor-
bachev would be once and for all
laid to rest as a devious illusion,
and any chances of Soviet eco-
nomic aid from the West would
be lost. How Gorbachev keeps
the Baltic states from revolting in
their quest for independence will
prove to be his ultimate test. .
There are many more ques-
tions: why did Gorbachev call
Bush’s proposal that the Soviets

pull their troops from Poland»

“propaganda”? Why did he state
that there was no immediate need
to tear down the Berlin Wall, as
Bush previously suggested?

But despite all the puzzling
questions, one fact is certain: the
Soviet Union has nowhere to go
but up. Hence, even the most
indifferent of Gorbachev’s
changes seem like giant leaps
toward a peace-seeking Soviet
Union. Let’s not deny the possi-
bility that today’s Soviet Union is
friendly and peace-seeking —

but let’s also not deny the possi— '

bility that it isn’t.

The 2nd Animation
Celebration, which starts Friday
at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, is
the the third and best cartoon
compilation film released this
year. The ‘1OS—minute film consists
of 24 shorts from around the
world.

_ Though hardly free from filler,
the Celebration has some

\ exuberanthighlights, particularly

“The Simpsons” by Matt Groeni g
of “Life in Hell” fame. A

Groenig, the man who brought
neurosis back to the comics,

“Simpsons” episodes for the
“Tracy Ullman Show. ”\X/e follow
the vulgar, lovable Simpson
family, led by a surly, bug—eyed
dad, through a funeral, a zoo trip

and a burping contest, among
other things.

‘The Simpsons” is less Complex .

and more mainstream than the
“Life in Hell” strip. That’s not a
complaint: it’s a joy to see
Groenig’s acerbic wit translated
to the more visceral art of film.
Celebration reaches a climax with
the hilarious family-portrait
session.

There are other superb shorts.
“25 Ways to Quit Smoking” lists
some morbid methods of kicking
the habit (removing your mouth,
keeping a pet tobacco beetle,
hiding your cigarettes in a blender,
etc.) with funny results.

In “Goodnight Norma
Goodnight Milton,” a bitchy
couple returns from a night with
their friends, setting the scene for
ghoulish irony. Many shorts look

Asst. Managing Editor

Heavy-metal superstars that
play ﬂutes and mandolins? That’s
what the Academy of Recording
Artists thought best embodied
the newly— formed Hard Rock/
Heavy Metal category last year,
as the Scottish band Jethro Tull
walked off with the controversial
Grammy Award for Crest of a
Knave.

A new year, new tour, and new
album later, Jethro Tull is on the
heels of its 20th anniversary with
the 1989 fall release of Rocle
Island.

In its third decade, Jethro Tul1’s
R00/e Island marks its 17th album
contribution (not counting live
recordings and compilations).
From the haunting “Another
Christmas Song” to the rocking
“Kissing Willie, ” the album stands
solidly as one of the band’s finest
Works.

combo’s founder/frontman/
songwriter/producer/mu1ti~ rt”
instrumentalist.

“We’d be considered far too
eclectic, and we’d probably be
unwilling to do the silly things
you have to do in order to become
successful,” said Anderson. “I
think we benefited from coming
of age during a period when
bands were allowed the space to
carve out their own territory, and
that’s one of the things that’s
made it possible for us to carry
on.” '

Rocle Island, recorded at
Anderson’s fully equipped home
studio, features Tull’s current
road—savvy lineup as one of the
group's strongest to date. Joining
charter member Anderson are
guitarist Martin Barre (a Tull
mainstay since 1969), bassist Dave
Pegg (a member since 1979),
drummer Doane Perry (who first
joined in 1984) and latest addition
Martin Allcock on keyboards.

Also participating on Rocle
Island is Tull alumnus Peter
Vettese, who contributes
additional keyboards on a few
tracks.

continues in the direction of Crest ‘

IMPORT NIGHT & MIXED DRINKS
No COVER

By Richard Turgeon
For The Pitt News

Director Johnathan Kaplan
(I—1eariI.ileea Wheel, 7beAccused)
updates John Hughes’ 1987 film
5be’5 Having a Baby with
Immediate Family, ‘a sentimental
“dramedy” about a middle-aged,
upper—class cou ple (Glenn Close
and James Woods) adopting a
child from a young, working-
class couple from the wrong side
of the tracks.

The product is pure ’80s; a slick
combination of television’s
“thirtysomething,” Tbe Big Chill
and montage built around newly
hip classic rock. Even though it’s
easily recognizable as a melting
pot of emotional manipulation,
it’s usually enjoyable when these
tactics are abandoned and the
attention is centered on the
interaction among members of
the experienced and well—chosen
cast

The movie gets off’ to a shaky
start as the childless, infertile
couple is introduced with a dry
exposition focusing primarily on
Glenn Close’s misery and James
Woods comforting her. It picks
up when Mary Stuart Masterson
comes. into the picture as the
couple’s salvation, offering her
unborn child through an adoption

agency. Her performance is an
extraordinary departure from her
other roles (At Close Range, Some
Kind of Wonderful), bringing real
emotion to the film and the
somewhat stereotypical scared/
confused, heavy-metal, pregnant
teen character mold screenwriter
Barbara (co-writer, Big Chill)
Benedek has created.

There are scenes of the couple
getting to know Masterson better
—’— illustrated by, among other
things, Close dancing with her to
Van Morrison’s “lnto the Mystic”
in an uncomfortably goofy aim at
endearment, and Woods and
Masterson cheering at a televised
‘football game.

Just when these circumstances
begin to become pointless, life is
breathed into the film in the form
of  yes, the father of the child
and Masterson’s Skid Row
boyfriend, yMatt Dillon, who’s

probably best known for his work '

in Platoon as the head—bashing
soldier Bunny. I

His prank at the meeting ofthe
two couples not only breaks the
ice between them, but between
the viewer and the film itself,
which, up to this point, has been
anything but a blast (not. that all

movies should be a blast, but A

at least interesting).

creating an exhibition of
significance and breadth.”

The exhibition is designed to
illustrate the entire history of
impressionism from its beginnings
in the 18605 to its end some 80
years later. Shown will be 85
paintings, pastels and sculptures

Gogh, Degas and Renoir.

This showcase will be

presented in three main sections.
The first shows the early
impressionist paintings of figure
subjects and coastal scenes,
along with works from the
heyday of impressionism, in the
18705 and ’80s, featuring

upon post-impressionistic works
by artists such as Gauguin and
Van Gogh, featuring the latter’s
painting, “The Olive Orchard. ” And
the final section focuses upon
Monet and Pisarro, the two artists
who remained dedicated to the

because contributing museums

permanent works from their
collections to big exhibitions;
yet these shows refused to stop
at the medium-sized museums,
opting for larger ones instead.

impressionist works of
exceptional quality, scope and
appeal to areas that are usually
neglected .

and concert series at the University

of Pittsburgh.

The concert will featurejohnny

Bailey (trumpet), Idris
Mohammad (drums), Arturo
Sandoval (trumpet), Donald Byrd

“There is something for

everyone — mainstream jazz,
funk and fusion. It promises to be
one of the hottest nights in
Pittsburgh entertainment history,”
said Davis.

This is the first time Sonny
Rollins has visited Pitt since his
induction into the International
Academy of Jazz Hall of Fame.
Last year Freddie Hubbard was

When asked about the old
image of Griffin assmall and
wearing bow ties bigger than
himself, Davis laughed and said,
“He hasn’t gotten any bigger, but
his sound sure has. You’ve got to
hear him for yourself.”

p According to a recent interview
with TbePittsburgb Press, Nathan
Davis knows that the general
public is looking forward to a
great concert. He also knows that
the musicians, are anticipating an
opportunity to work and play
together, as well as learn from

Unfortunately, after this all-too-
brief moment of fun, Immediate
Familyquickly returns to its slow
and dreary old self. Deliberate
ﬂashes of comic relief, usually
dealing with the family dog, in
this syrupy premise seem like
godsends and are often mistaken
as being hilarious because of the
ominous tone maintained before
them.

The story.isn’t as predictable as
one might think, and the nice
thing about it is that it really
doesn’t have any villains. Even
though its lack of credibility is
saved only by the ensemble cast,
they don't make up for its
unnecessary length or artificial,
sentimentally stained script.

Immediate Family can’t really
entertain in’ a light way because

 of the somber subject at hand; it
‘ doesn’t

work dramatically
because it tries too hard to make
the characters sympathetic. The

The Pitt soccer team completed
their 1989 season with a 1-1 tie at
Grove City on Tuesday. The
Panthers finished with a winning
record (8-6-3).

After playing to a 0-0 deadlock
in regulation time, the Panthers
scored in the first overtime period;
Huy Tran fielded a punt by Pitt
goalkeeper Jay Kapusta, nodded
the ball past a defender and
scored.

overtime when Kapusta slipped
on the wet field, allowing an easy
goal. 6

Coach Joe Luxbacher said the
game was typical of the entire
season for the Panthers.

“We dominated the game but
failed to capitalize,” he said.

The Panthers outshot Grove
City 22-6, and held the edge in
number of corner kicks, 7-1.

Tran, a freshman walk-on, was
the Panthers’ leading scorer this
season with seven goals and two
assists for 16 points.

signifying automatic ejection (the
Big East coaches were allowed to
make the choice for the
conference, and the vote was
almost unanimous in favor‘ of the
rule). The only other major
conference besides the Big East
to take the NCAA up on their
offer is the SEC.

Now, maybe this won’t make a
big difference in conference play.
Maybe the officials will call the
games the same way they used
to. Maybe the Big East players
won’t havelany problems at all
adjusting to having that extra foul
taken away once the NCAA
Tournament starts.

And maybe hell will freeze
over, too.

“I think I was the only negative
vote [among the other Big East
coachesl,” Pitt head coach Paul

Evans said. “I don’t like rules that .

don’t apply in the NCAA
tournament. You play all year
with six fouls and all of a sudden
its five fouls.

“A kid’s mentality all along is
that he doesn’t have to be
cautious. Then the rule changes.”

The rule can work both for and
against a team such as Pitt, whose
depth problems have been well-
publicized over the years.

“I personally like it,” Pitt forward

Tran did not begin the season
as a member of the team because
his freshman eligibility papers
were not approved in time.

“I didn’t even know about him
at the beginning of the season,”
said Luxbacher. ,

Other Panther leading scorers
were junior co—captain Mike Blatz
(six goals, three assists, for 15
points), senior Heinz Pak (two
goals, five assists, for nine points),

(three goals, no assists, for six
points).

aggression

Brian Shorter said. “I can be more
aggressive on defense and not
have to worry about getting in
foul trouble as easily."
However, it would be hard to
imagine the Panthers beating
Georgetown last year at the Civic
Arena if Mourning did not foul
out with several minutes
remaining in the second half. The
possibility exists that a huge team
like the Hoyas could have run

wild throughout Big East play. ’

“It’s gonna benefit a big team,”
Shorter said. “Anytime you have
a lot of big players, it’s always
good for them to stay in the

game.” L
“It’s going to allow teams like
Georgetown to be more

aggressive because they’ll have
an extra foul to give,” Evans
added. - “

Yet another aspect that has not
been addressed as much is the
impact that it will have on
officiating in Big East games. The

playing physical basketball, and

chances (than last year)," said
Luxbacher. “We just didn’t finish
them.”

“With a couple of breaks we
could have won two or three
more games.”

Luxbacher commended his
team for not allowing injuries to
affect their play. I

“They could have used injuries
as an excuse [for losing].”

Panther goalkeeper Jay
Kapusta, a junior, finished the
season with a 6-6-3 record and

allowed 1.36. goals per game with
three shutouts. He also recorded
a rare assist against Grove City.

“Jay has matured. He was much

Luxbacher. Throw out the 8-1

' Pitt basketball coach Paul Evans is not happy with the Big

East's new six foul rule adaptation.

.ILet them play in the world of college football  

By Chris Kuzneski
Staff Writer

In the world of college football, there
is only one thing that makes me nauseous.
No, it isn’t steroids; in fact, I enjoy watching
“juiced up” men knock the living slop out
of each other. And the commercialization
of college athletics doesn’t bother me

Qeither. I mean, if the NCAA wants to

rename one of it’s bowl games “The Al
Bennett Dealin’ Man Bowl,” it’s none of
my business.

The one thing that does bother me and
most true sports fans, however, is college
coaches that claim to care about their

layers. As far as I’m concerned, there is

A no room for love in amateur athletics.

The classic example of this syndrome
is Penn State’sJoe Paterno. Year after year,
Paterno preaches about the “ideal

standards” that every member of his team
must uphold, and year after year, his
players uphold these standards and make
him proud. YUCK!!!

Take this year, for example. Penn
State’s starting QB Tom Bill was arrested
for drinking in public, and was temporarily
suspended from the team. Of course, this
wasn’t done in order to publicly embarrass
Bill, or even to set an example for the
team. No, Joe Pa went out on a limb and
suspended him “in order to relieve his
athletic pressures; therefore, enabling him
to straighten out his personal life.” BARF!!!

College athletics doesn’t need this.
Give me a coach who will publicly
embarrass his players until they snap into
to shape, and I’ll show you a winner.
There is absolutely no room for sympathy
and caring in sports.

Unfortunately, this “plague of love

and caring” is spreading faster than trade
rumors in the Penguins locker room. The
latest, and most noticeable, coach to
subscribe to this sensitive style of coaching
is Notre Dame’s head coach Lou Holtz.
In a recent display of affection, Holtz
claimed his No. 1 Fighting Irish may not

participate in a bowl game because his

“team may not be adequately prepared.”
No, Holtz isn’t worried about his players
screwing up plays, or even being physically
drained from a very emotional season.
Instead, Holtz was concerned that his
players were being deprived of quality
time with their loved ones over the holiday
season._

Of course, Holtz does know his players,
and apparently Tony Rice would rather
sing “Deck the Halls” with his grandparents
than play for the national championship
against Colorado in the Orange Bowl.

Even though skipping a bowl“ game
appears pretty drastic, it isn’t even Holtz’s
most sickening display of public affection
in the last few weeks. ‘ A

Last Tuesday, shortly after a brawl—.
filled game with USC, Holtz claimed that
he would resign if similar events occurred
in any future Notre Dame game. Holtz,
however, didn’t make this pledge in an
attempt to threaten his players into
conformity, but rather to protect the
sparkling reputation of his players and the
fine institution that is Notre Dame.

This is the kind of thing that has to
stop. When I tune in to ESPN’s Sports
Center, I want to hear Chris Berman
imitating Howard Cosell instead of Lou
Holtz imitating Gandhi. Until the NCAA
takes measures to clean “love” out of its
sports, real sports fans will have to hang
their heads in shame.

Chris Bosak
Last Week: 8-5
Season: 65-39

Pittsburgh at Denver: The
Steelers are playing way too
inconsistently to beat Denver, no
matter who plays quarterback.

Detroit at Houston: Houston is‘

playing well enough tolbeat the
Lions, but then again, ‘the Pitt
intramural all-star football team
could beat the Lions.

‘Indianapolis at Miami: Miami

is still singing the same tune, “If

I I Only Had a Defense.” Even the

lax Colts’ offense will be enough
-to beat the Dolphins.

I N.Y. Jets at New England: Both

teams stink, but the Patriots have
a little fresh talent. Take the Pats.
Seattle at Kansas City: Kansas
City receivers will have a big
game and will win before their
home crowd.

L.A. Rams at Minnesota: L.A.
will lose their fourth straight. The
Vikings will ﬁnally get something
going offensively, and their
defense is always the best in the
league.

Cleveland at Tampa Bay:
Cleveland will be 6-3 and alone
in the AFC central lead by the end
of the week.

Chicago at Green Bay: Green
Bay is tough, but not powerful
enough to beat the Bears.

Buffalo at Atlanta: Atlanta has a I

decent team, but can’t win. Buffalo
will beat the struggling Falcons.
Philadelphia at San Diego:

N.Y. Giants at Phoenix: The
Giants won a slimy game against
the Vikings on Monday, and will
win again Sunday just because
they are playing a weak team.
Cincinnati at LA. Raiders: As I

Pittsburgh at Denver: The first-
place Broncos will increase their
lead over the Raiders in the AFC

.West by beating Bubby.

Detroit at Houston: Detroit will
remain in the cellar asthe Oilers
prevail in the “House of Pain.”

        
     
   

Indianapolis at Miami: Marino
will not get sacked this week,
and will instead throw for over
300 yards Miami. ,

N .Y. Jets at New England: I just
cannot bring myself to ever pick
the Jets in a football game.

, Seattle at Kansas City: This will

actually be an exciting game and
probably the most difficult to

pick this week. But I’m going’

with the Seahawks in an upset.
L.A. Rams at Minnesota: Oh, so
Minnesota plays a real team again
this week. Well, we all know
what happened Monday night.
Rams.

Cleveland at Tampa Bay: The
spread on this game is only three
in favor of the Browns. They will
win by much more than that.
Chicago at Green Bay: Upset of
the week! Packers to roll up in
America’s dairyland.

Buffalo at Atlanta: Atlanta just
keeps getting worse and Buffalo
just keeps improving. ’

Philadelphia will remain one back

I could think of no one better
to ask than the Big East publicity
director, Chris Plonsky.

“The coaches just felt that they
wanted this rule because
basketball is the only sport where
you can be disqualified for
committing a penalty,” Plonsky
said. “You don’t get thrown out
of a game in football or hockey
unless you do something
ﬂagrant.”

With all due respect to the Big
East mentors, I’ve grown
accustomed to distinguishing

basketball from the other team
sports. To compare it to a contact
sport is, for lack of a better word,
asinine.

The prospect of fouling out of
a basketball game is the one facet
of the sport which makes it
physically and mentally grueling
at times. It is as much a part of the
game as the slam dunk.

Taking that part of the game
away merely for the sake of
change was totally unnecessary
and will take excitement away
from the contests rather than add
thrills.

— Gynecology Exams

If you have sex and don't use an
effective form of birth control, you're
going to get pregnant.

For many young women, birth
control pills are the best answer.
They're safe, extremely effctive, and
as simple to take as a. daily vitamin.
Here are some questions you should
ask yourself about any birth control
_method, and some answers about
”the pill.”

O HOW SAFE IS IT? For
women under 30, the pill is just as
safe as any other birth control
method. It's also safer than
pregnancy and childbirth. A health
professional can tell you if there's a
good reason to use another method
instead.

e HOW Doss IT WORK?

either keep your ovaries from
releasing eggs—no eggsrng
conception—or change yo1lr\cervix or
uterus, making it harder for eggs
and sperm to get together.

  

O HOW WILL I FEEL? Today's
finely calculated dosages have
reduces the minor side effects you
may have heard about, like morning
nausea, tender breasts, and spotting
between periods. If side effects do
occurk they usually disappear as
your body adjusts to the pill. Weight
gain? Some women gain, some lose.
You can usually solve either problim
by adjusting your diet.
