Pitt Appropriations In;
a-State Money Still Out

By MARK MURPHY
Pitt News Staff Writer‘

The Pennsylvania House of
Representatives yesterday ap-
proved $300 million in non-prefer-
red appropriations, including $61.7
million for pitt, even though no
funds are available to allocate.

When the legislators return to
the Capital next week, they must
tackle the problem of ﬁnding the
$300 million, whether it comes
from a tax increase or deletion of
already authorized programs.

The appropriations approval is

Q-the ﬁrst step in the ﬁght for the

monies necessary to the economic
survival of Pitt, Penn State
University, Temple University,
Lincoln University and other
non-preferred institutions.

The 31 appropriations bills,
easily. passed by the House
yesterday, are expected to receive
similar treatment in the Senate.

In addition to Pitt’s $61.7
million, passed by a House vote of
154-60, the bills provided $69.7
million for Temple, $108 million for
Penn State and $3.6 million for
Lincoln. Other area institutions
were also affected; Western

-.Qf:B§ychiatric Institute and Clinic was

. "ox
L‘ I

granted $4.5 million and Buhl
Planetarium was granted $100,000.
Carnegie Museum’s request for
$100,000 was turned down, how-
ever.

In other action, the House
overwhelmingly rejected an
amendment that would have
allowed a $50 tuition credit to
Pennsylvania residents attending
state-related colleges full-time.

According "to the amendment’s
sponsor. Pittsburgh Democrat lvan
Itkin. the thrashing his proposal
took is a result of the attitudes of
many of his collegues.

“The mood of the legislators is to
cut . back,-
‘iﬂf-,‘get.” Itkin said. “They failed
to approve it because the cost of
giving credit to all Pennsylvania
residents in the state-related
colleges would have been $6
million."

Under a system that would have

not add on to the I

called for direct appropriations to
the schools and adjusted invoices to
students, Pitt would have received
$1.5 million, Penn State, $3.1
million, Temple, $1.4 million and
Lincoln, $32,000.

Itkin was prompted to propose
the amendment because higher
taxes now being contemplated in
the Legislature, combined with
higher college tuitions, will upset
“equity among taxpayers.”

“Raising taxes after colleges
have raised tuitions will cause a
double burden to parents,” Itkin
said. ‘‘If that family has one or
more youngsters attending a
state-related university, they will

be absorbing a disproportionate’

share of the costs of funding higher
education. My amendments would
at least distribute those costs more
equitably among all taxpayers.”

By BETSY NORMAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Betty Friedan, feminist author
and founder of the National
Organization for Women (NOW),
blamed the Sept. 5 suicide of Pitt
research associate Dr. Dorothy
Jean South on Pitt’s “institutional
sexism.”

Friedan joined Rev. Betty Bone
Schiess. one of the ﬁrst women
ordained as an Episcopal priest,
and local feminists at a memorial
service to mourn Dr. South.

“We must use the tragedy of Dr.
South to advance the case for life.”
Friedan said Wednesday at Heinz
Chapel. “So many gains have been
made and young women believe

_the ﬁght is over. They must be

shown the battle hasn’t ,been
won." ‘

South. came to Pitt in 1974 with a
National Institute of Health (NHI)
grant in biochemistry. Her
contract was terminated August 31.
ﬁve days before her death. She
submitted over 200 applications but
was unable to ﬁnd other employ-
ment.

Friedan Condemns University 'Sexism'

“South’s position is
unique,” Friedan said. “In an
economic retrenchment like today,
women are the ones who pay the
price.

In her address at the memorial,

service, Schiess said, “We come
together mainly to identify and root
out calumny in high places, to
muster strength, to make sense of
this tragedy, to give meaning to
this sacriﬁce, to redeem this sad
moment by rededicating ourselves
to the ancient ﬁght for freedom and
justice.

“The pinch of academic indif-
ference is not new,” Schiess
continued. “Some of us are dulled
by accomodation to it. There is
special poignancy and pain, added
outrage. We are forced to
acknowledge that women must
endure at this late moment in
history. massive humiliation from
such presumably enlightened
sources as our universities.”

Friedan accused Pitt of “refus-
ing to deal with the issue of sex
discrimination.” ‘‘In these_ past

ity has spent less than $500,000
ﬁghting these suits in the past ﬁve
years.

“Dorothy South, like so many
other women, put her hopes on the
Johnson case. The courts decided
in August that Pitt did discriminate
against women, but it was
impossible to prove in Sharon
Johnson’s case,” Friedan said.

“The loss of this case was a
terrible blow, and the Unviersity
told Johnson and her lawyers they
cannot talk about the case or sex
discrimination. Somehow I sup-
pose Pitt thought they could do
anything to women.

“What I think Pitt should do, if it
has any hunianity, is to have the
grace to be horriﬁed by the death of
South,” Friedan added. ‘‘Instead
of spending the taxpayers money to
fight sex discrimination suits, they
should use that money to set up
effective affirmative action plans.

“We’re all tired of ﬁghting,”
Friedan said. “But we must not
stop. Young woment must fight for
the opportunities South didn’t
have.”

Pitt's Buyers Unaware
Of J.P.Stevens Boycott

ByBETSYNORMAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s decision to boycott products
produced by the strike -plagued
J .P. Stevens Company, announced
ﬁve months ago, is still news to
University purchasere.

In the May 10 Pitt News, it was
reported the Chancellor had asked
that, until further notice, no
purchases be made from the
Stevens Company, according to the
Chancellor's assistant secretary
John Quatroche.

“We have a legal obligation to
conform to applicable rules and
regulations in the arena of labor
relations, ” Quatroche said.

But yesterday, the Chancellor's
assistant Helen Knox, said, “The

University has not taken, nor will it
take, any position on the J. P.
Stevens boycoot. We neither
condemn not condone it.”

Southern-based Stevens is the
second-largest textile manufacturer
in the United States and one of the
largest “Fortune 500” industrial
corporations. It has been found
guilty of violating several labor
laws, including the National Labor
Relations Act, the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Act and the
Occupational Health and Safty Act.

Stevens also has been charged
with racial and sexual discrimina-
tion and with violating federal
regulations on noise and dust levels
at its plants.

Academic Review Returns

The Undergraduate Academic
Review (UAR) will be published
winter term, returning after’ a
two-year absence.

Previously, academic evaluation
was done only by students, through
questionnaires. The system was
reviewed by a University Senate

. committee, whose purpose was to

submit recommendations to the
Provost’s ofﬁce for a policy on the

evaluation of teaching.

These recommendations were
approved by the Senate Council
earlier this year.

The review system now com-
prises a formal student evaluation
of courses and teaching methods
and a corresponding self-evaluation
by faculty members.

The evaluation will consist of
course materials, including enroll-

ment ﬁgures, published course
descriptions, syllabi and reading
lists, required texts, assignments,
examinations, examination results
(distributions of student scores,
sample tests) and student evalua-
tions.

Other relevant information, such
as evidence of changes and
improvements in the course,
graduate student evaluations and
evaluations made through peer
visitation, also will be included.

The UAR will be coordinated by
the Center for the Evaluation of
Teaching (CET) and distributed by
the Student Government Board.

According to the Senate Com-
mittee, the UAR will be consulted
when personnel decisions, such as
those for promotion and tenure, are
made. Other factors, including
accomplishments other than teach-
ing, also will be considered.

Unaware of

Knox explained that after the ﬁrst
announcement of the boycott policy.
Pitt’s legal counsel advised Vice
Chancellor Joseph Dutton that Pitt
“should not take a position on the
boycott.” '

Dale Newman, a member of the

University committee supporting
the boycott, was surprised to hear of
the change in policy.

“It comes as a surprise to me. I
thought there would be no more
purchases of Stevens products by
Pitt. The reasons given don’t seem
adequate to change their policy. No
one involved with the boycott was
informed of this change.”

History professor Dave Montgom-
ery initiated correspondence with
the ‘Chancellor that led to the
original announcement.

‘‘I don’t believe Dave knows of
this change. With the coverage
given by the Pitt News earlier this
summer when Pitt came out in
support, I would think there would
be coverage for this,” Newman
said.

Montgomery is on a leave of
absence and was unavailable for
comment.

ABORTION CONTROVERSY
STILL UNRESOLVED

WASHINGTON (AP)—Mem-
bers of a House and Senate
conference committee failed again
yesterday to agree on a government
abortion policy, but said their
impasse will not cut off federal
welfare beneﬁts for the nation’s

poor.
After an acrimonious, three-hour
session, committee members

agreed to try again on Monday to
decide when the government should
pay for abortions for poor women.
While the dispute will not affect
payment for most federal social
service program, it may mean a
reduced paycheck for thousands of

Friday,

federal bureaucrats unless it is
resolved by Oct. 18.

The controversy over federal
funding of abortions for poor
women is tied to legislation
providing $60.2 billion for the
departments of Labor and Health,
Education and Welfare.

The current funding authoriza-
tion for the two departments expires
on Friday, and approval of
operating money for next year has
been delayed in Congress by the
abortion dispute.

Integrity Code Revised;

Suspension Terms Eosed

By TOM KUKUCKA

Students found guilty of violating
Pitt’s academic integrity code now
are able to avoid the immediate
enforcement of sanctions pending
appeal, due to a revision in the
guidelines on academic integrity.

In the past, according to Dan
Harper, judicial advocate of the
campus judicial system, a student
found guilty of violating the code by
the Academic Integrity Board
immediately was subject to suspen-
sion from classes or suspension

In the past, according to Dan
Harper, advocate of the campus
judicial system, a student found
guilty of violating the code by the
Academic Integrity Board im-
mediately was subject to the

 

imposed sanction (for example,
suspension from classes or suspen-
sion from the University), even if he
intended to appeal his case.

The revision, “Process for a stay
of sanction pending appeal,”
permits the student to contact‘the
University Review Board (URB)
moderator about lifting the sanction
pending appeal.

The moderator, who conducts the
administrative and procedural op-
erations of the URB, then will meet
with another student and a faculty
member to hear the student’s
request. If the moderator’s ofﬁce
rules the sanction unfair in the light
of the student’s appeal, the student
will be permitted to attend to his‘
classes or studies until a decision on
the appeal is reached.

CARTER CHIDES SENATE
ACTION ON ENERGY

WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi-
dent Carter, chiding the Senate for
dismantling his energy program
and delaying a ﬁnal vote, warned
yesterday that “with every passing
day our energy problems become
more severe.

“The American people are
expecting the Congress to pass a
national energy plan,” Carter said,
in a news conference statement
aimed at the Senate as much as at
his national television audience.

While the" Senate continued its
battle over deregulation of natural
gas prices, Carter reiterated his
opposition to removing the price
controls and said ‘ ‘no interest group
or organization can be satisﬁed with
every part of our plan.”

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

 

Now Comes The War

Pitt has come safely through one of four votes necessary to
ensure state funding of the University and other state-related
institutions, but the fight for higher education appropriations has
barely begun, especially for Pitt.

Pitt’s appropriation is termed “non-preferred” by the
Legislature, meaning a two-thirds vote is necessary for passage. In
the state House, non-preferred appropriations require 136 votes.
Pitt’s funding attracted 154 votes; enough for passage. bl_lt 3150
enough to show that recently unfavorable publicity concerning the
University has cost Pitt some legislative support. Twice as many
legislators voted to deny Pitt’s funding as voted against Penn
State's. More than last year’s football score is to blame.

Three more votes must be taken—and won——before the checks
from Harrisburg begin to arrive. House Majefit)’ Leader James
Manderino chose to take up the appropriations bill before the also-
necessary tax package, believing it would create more pressure fora
tax increase. This may be good strategy. but the tax P3-me 5"“ Wfu
be a difficult one for either side to win. The tax Increases W111
require the approval of only a majority in each legislative chamber,
but the votes will come much more reluctantly than those for the
expenditure of the taxes.

That some legislators still are opposed to new taxes, even if that
stance means an abandonment of higher education, is
demonstrated by several recent actions. Almost 30 percent of the
House members voted against Pitt’s appropriation; 10 non-
preferred institutions, including Carnegie Museum, saw their
funding defeated and an amendment to cut the Governor’s
recommendations on non-preferred appropriations was brought to
avote.

The bills sent to the Senate provide $61.7 million for Pitt, an

amount slightly smaller than that recommended by Gov. Shapp‘

some months ago. Western Psychiatric Institute, closely affiliated
with Pitt, would get $4.5 million. ‘

These amounts are not what Pitt deserves, but we doubt if
anyone in the Cathedral is complaining too vigorously. Vigorous
action will be needed, however, if Pitt is to receive even this level of
funding. The Senate must vote for the expenditures, both the
Senate and House must vote for taxes and the universities must
work to ensure that all of this happens in the near future.

Let’s Not Forget Kent State I

Let us not forget Kent State. Let
us never forget Kent State. May 4,
1970 always must be an important
date in our country's history. On
that day, four students were killed
by the guns of National Guards-
men. Two women and two men,
demonstrating the Vietnam War,
were murdered.

I was 13. I knew that students

across the country were denounc- _

ing U.S. involvement in Indochina.
Time magazine showed me pic-
tures of it. My sister knew what

was going on. She even went to
Washington to demonstrate.

Playing basketball and riding my
bicycle were more interesting to

melilow I am appalled. The state of
Ohio wants to build a gymnasium
on the site of the murders. The
bulldozers already have started
work. Protesters have delayed
their progress. Something must be

Oileinissed the 60s. (I was too
young. A 13-year-old doesn't know

‘ much about the world around him.

Now I an 20, and myiinsides hurt
when I think about the tragedy.
Kent State has provided me with

      

‘I-

one truth as to what was real in this-/' I

60s and what is wrong today.
Reliving the past is senseless, but
remembering our history—the
tragedies and the triumphs-—is
important. These must be
preserved. Let future generations
be able to remember Kent State as
it was on May 4, 1970.

Imperialism Exploits Azanian People

So it seems Andrew Young rides
again, galloping through the pages
of the Pitt news, distorting and
ignor ing the true character of
United States involvement in South
Africa. United States imperialism
has been -super-exploiting the
Azanian (South African) people for
years, making incredible proﬁts
from apartheid, and it does not want
to give apartheid or those proﬁts up.
But the mass resistance of the
Azanian people and the support
from oppressed peoples all over the
world is forcing the United
States/British ruling class into a
situation of panic and a mad
scramble to work out sham
independence schemes in order to
preserve its proﬁts and rule.

Andrew Young and the recent
article in the Pitt News verbally
condemn apartheid and say they
support the cause of Africa’s
oppressed; in the next breath, they
tell the people that struggle against
apartheid is immortal and self-
defeating. After decades of
peaceful economic struggle proved
completely ineffective and armed
struggle was begun, Andrew Young
drop in and says, “Lay down your
guns and work through boycotts,”

Feminism Versus Man-Hcitingg

By MARTHA H. GARVEY

Feminists have been accused of a
lot of things. They don’t wear
underwear, and they have no sense
of humor. They are bitter and
frustrated. They are man-haters.
(This argument usually does not
stop to consider that there are male
feminists, and it's a little diﬁicult
to live your life in a continuous
state of self-loathing.)

_ This epithet has become parti-
cularly dangerous since Anita

Bryan‘ deddeé “'92 §!*9.~¥e§ .so.od. -

tor something other than selling
orange juice. Man-hating implies
woman-loving. If you are a
feminist and a woman and someone
calls you a man-hater in Dade
County, you have something to
worry about. But feminism and
lesbianism is another story. It is an
important story, but it is not this
one.

Feminism is not a synonym for
man-hating. If it is, then I'm in the
wrong movement. Feminism is
about possibilities. Feminism is

about open doors. At the core, at

-4’-

rC<W!"!*s€d.9'? P93 5).. - , -

the gut. at the place where you feel
things, feminism isn't even about
men and women. It is about each
human being having the fullest
imaginable range of possibilities
for his or her life. It is about being
aware of those possibilities and
being able -to act on those
possibilities.

I believe this is what most people
want. I believe this is important, as
important as having enought to eat.
Often. it is directly connected with
having enough to eat.

United States imperialism is trying
to play both sides of the fence in a
last-ditch attempt to fool people into
thinking it is progressive. Andrew
Young serves the ruling class as a
social prop, winning people over to
false conceptions of United States
foreign policy, to the Big Lie.

What are the facts that liberals
can’t as a social prop, winning
people over to false conceptions of
United States foreign policy, to the
Big Lie.

What are the facts that liberals
can’t or don’t deal with? United
States multinationals pay black
miners one-twentieth of what they
pay white miners——this ability to
generat super-profits is at the base
of iinperialism’s love affair with
apartheid, which "liberals say is
upheld only by crazy white South
Africans. In August, Citibank of
New York loaned another $60
million to mining companies in
South Africa. So much for
industry’s opposition to apartheid.

The Johannesburg Times re-
ported that South African “security
agents" are being trained in the
United States and are working in the
United States for the Voorster
regime in conjunction with intelli-
gence agencies. In June, United
States police agencies and agents of
the South African Bureau of State
Security (BOSS) joined forces to
crack a code used by a South African
political prisoner, poet Breyton
Breytonbach.

Ignoring the arms embargo to
South Africa established by Con-
gress in 1963, United States
weapons manufacturers have been
steadily supplying the South
African military for 14 years without
any United States government
interference. These United States-
manufactured and/or liscensed
weapons include armored cars,
tanks, personnel carriers, guns, jet
bombers, helicopters, etc. So much
for the government's opposition to

. -%1?%r.t1.1.ei.<l.-. . -

It is clear to the peoples of South

Africa that they are engaged ind}

life-and—death struggle against
United States imperialism. They
are not willing to continue living
under conditions of super-exploi-
tation, whether the head of state is
white or black. The Azanian people
will drive United State imperialism
to the sea. And in that process, the
people of Southern Africa are
keeping an eye on the back door to
prevent the imperialist Soviet Union
from sneaking into power and
setting up an oppressive regime like
in nearby Angola, where the people
are beaten down by Cuban troops
and Soviet advisors. Just as
Africans won't trade white exploit-
ers for black ones, neither will t!‘ v_
trade United States imperialism’ tor
Soviet social imperialism. Imper-
ialism.

History has proven how small
countries can defeat big ones and
how weak nations can defeat strong
ones if the people are mobilized in
revolution and are willing to
struggle. This is what is happening
and will continue to happen in South
Africa. There is no way United
States imperialism can endear itself
to the peoples of South Africa, p,0,

um

matter how hard Andrew Yorkie:

tries. United States imperialism
can’t even endear itself to United
States workers. The same
corporations that oppress African
workers oppress workers here:
African miners are super-exploited
while United States lose their
beneﬁts; Allegheny Ludlum rips off
workers on both sides of the ocean.
the struggle for liberation in
Southern Africa is the same
struggle workers have here,
because imperialism is a world
system. Therefore, the anti-
irnperialist struggle is a worldwigf”
struggle.

Man-Hating And
Feminism Controsted

(Continued from Page 4)

Many people get confiised and
upset when they see an angry
feminist. Anger is not attractive, it

'is not sexy. and it makes people
uncomfortable. Anger--I prefer
the word to hatred—is an emotion,
and emotions can be frightening.

But for each woman and man
who identiﬁes in some way with
feminism. anger is where feminism
begins. It could be the anger of a
woman refused a job, or the anger
of a man who never knows his child
well enough precisely because he
ahs to work, work, work. It is anger
at a door being shut, or anger at a
door never opened.

But the shut door is no one man’s
and no one woman’s fault. The
shut doors are attached to a
structure, and that is what I hate. I
hate the institutions that deny
women the possibility of work and
men the possibility of parenthood.
I hate the structure that makes both
rape and heart attacks possible at
40.

But what Ihate most of all is that
it is hard for us. men and women,
to talk to each other. Men and
women are raised differently. Is
this news to anyone? Men and

women grow up in dttterent worlds.
Like members of different.planets,
their languages are different.
Unlike members of different
planets, they must live and work
together. So when this member of
a different planet is someone I love,
when he doesn’t understand what
I’m saying, then I get frustrated.
And when we keep misunder-
standing each other, when .1 ask for
work and he gives me a house,
when I ask for food and he gives me
a handful of stones, then I get
angry.
but feminism is making the
jump. It is jumping from this very
personal anger—this hatred—to
the understanding that every man
and every woman goes through
this. Feminism is. trying to make
one language of two. What I have
tried to do here is translate.

I ask people who are frightened
or repelled by feminism to lookxland
listen to the anger again. Look at
the anger, and see that it is energy
trying to get a door open. Listen
to the hatred, and understand that
it has nothing to do with you, or
your sex——but everything to do
with the world you live in.

RSA  

Defends
Event

I would like to reply to the letter
by “Disgusted Senior” protesting
“entertainment in the Quad” by
RSA. RSA stands for Resident
Student Association. Every student
who lives in a Residence Hall
belongs to this organization. What
the RSA leaders try to do is get the
students (you)involved in some-
thing more than just academics.
They want to provide an outlet for
your talents, interests and ideas.

I agree that you paid for your
room and should be allowed to study
there. That is the purpose of quiet
hours from 8p.m. to 8a.m. Sunday
through Thursday. This week’s
RSA event, An Evening of Music,
was staged at dinner time (5p.m .) a
time when most students do not
study, and ended by 8p.m. when
quiet hours began. This type of
activity will be continuing during
the year indoors in the Student
Union Lower Lounge.

I’m sorry you do not want to be
involved in these kinds of activities,
pep rallies, coffee houses, corn
roasts, it is difficult to plan an event
that will be of interest to everyone.
That is why your input is valuable.
There are many means to express

your interest, such as RSA your
Resident Assistant, Hall Council
and Student Government. I hope
that instead of complaining about
‘inconveniences, you decide to take
advantage of one of these areas and
involve yourself in something more
suited to your interests.

Punk Rock Smashes
NYC Night Life

By MIKE SHIELDS

NEW YORK—At the end of
Greenwich Village, on the far
reaches of Bleecker Street, there is
an unprepossessing tavern club. A

tacky beer hall, CBGB’s is situated_

on the edge of one of America’s
most blasted urban ghettos——the
Bowery. It is an unlikely home for a
revolution in rock music, and an
unlikely revolution it is.

This revolution is called punk
rock. It began innocently. CBGB’s
originally slated by its owner for

i ‘country, bluegrass and blues-

hence the name—launched a local
bar band known as the Ramones.

The Ramones played rock music
divorced from most pop forms. It
wasn't disco music or countriﬁed
rock, like the Allman Brothers.

The Ramones’ music resembled
50’s rock and roll, but not in an
imitative Sha Na Na fashion. The
Ramone brothers cut their music to
skeletal frames, relying on guitars
and a single drummer. They
ignored melody or chord changes
and avoided any trace of 50’s
sentimentality.

The Ramones were discovered by
blase New Yorkers, and similar
groups started to emerge from the
same area. Tom Verlaine’s
Television, Blondie and Talking
Heads became cult bands.

But it was a New Jersey poetess,
Patti Smith, who gave punk rock its
ﬁrst national exposure. Smith’s
only previous musical exposure was
track with the Blue Oyster Cult on a
privately-released single.

Smith’s emergence, with the
critically acclaimed “Horses” al-
bum, would have been classic
Hollywood were it not for her
slouched, leather-jacket deﬁance of
K-Mart sensibilities. But the
spotlight was there and “punkers”

ecame a serious subject in the
minds of American music critics.
A teddy-boy rage in dessicated
England. The rest is rock pulp-mag
history.

  

So now Itravel to New York City,
in the hope of sluicing some
proﬁtable blood from this fattened
calf. I must guard against
preconceptions. Admittedly, I am

educated by the bulldozer general-

izations of Newsweek maga-
zine. Newsweek ran a recent article

designed to be the ﬁnal word on
punk rock. In truth, the article was

scholarly but the photographic text ’

was inﬂammatory. Pictures of

A Writer With Meaning

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer.

“It would be frustrating for a
writer not to be published,” Pitt
writing professor Mark Harris said.

Harris would be unfamialiar with

ﬂat situation; he's had articles,

fsays. reviews. stories. disserta-
tions. autobiographies and novels
published for many different ﬁrms,
ranging form Purdue’s magazine.
The Responsible Screw. to Alfred
A. Knopf. In fact. his latest
article——an essay on sports immor-
tal Lou Gehrilg—appears in this
"week's version of TV Guide,
perhaps the most widely bought
magazine in the United States.

Where does he find the time?

“I ﬁnd pleasure in working.”
Harris said during a recent

“interview. ‘‘I like to see myself
shaping my story. like a potter.
graphic artist or tailor. It's the
pleasure in the making of the work
I Cnjtiy.”

But the work he creates is more
than the cloth from a suit; there is
meaning in his words.

“There’s inspiration. idea be-
hind it that a tailor may not have."
Harris insisted. “Every syllable I
write has meaning. Robert Frost
once said. ‘Every phrase is a dipth
for depth.’ That's my writing-
meaning in every phrase."

Not that that meaning is

(;w§Nntcnti.»nall_\' planned before the

work is begun.

“I don't think I have a particular
reason for writing something."
Harris explained. "ljust begin and

see where I go. I don’t start with a
conscious idea of what I want to
say. .

“I ask myself. ‘How do you make
a movie on that kind of person?’ "
he added. referring to the Gehrig
piece. “Then I arrange data within
that theme.”

But Harris contends he is more
than an information ﬁle-—that he
has a different point of view on his
writing.

‘‘I don’t feel I'm tel1ing—I just
seee the world different way and if
people can see it that way. too.
then that’s my point of view."

Not that Harris’ view of life is a
confusing mishmash of mutated
every day events; it is a normal
one. with plenty of meaning. a life
that some writers don’t seem to
lead.

“Most writers’ stories today
have no meaning." Harris said.
“They believe that no meaning is
meaning enough-—regrettable but

true. _
“I think that what I write is

temperate and exact.” he con-
tinued. “Some people think it
doesn't have any meaning. It
doesn't. burst out against ideas and
mstttut1ons—it’s genteel.’.’

Harris’ work isn’t genteel, but
it’s not aggressive, either; he
merely writes the way he believes
the world should live.

“My writing imitates the kind of
life I'd like to see people live—a
rational. temperate life. I’m a
comic writer—I just laugh when I
wrtte."

Which seems a bit strange for
someone who once was a journalist.

“I haven't thought of myself as a
journalist for a long time.” he
insisted. “Now I can even decline
to do things if I want.”

But Harris didn’t decline TV
Guide. and in the future may not.

“I plan on trying to get my own
writing going." he conﬁrmed.
“Make me an offer and I'll ponder
it."

To TV Guide’s delight.

American cities, New York is both
terrible and fascinating, a center of
the American myth. So if the music
at CBGB’s seems brilliant in its New
York home, it may fade in the
unromantic atosphere of Pitts-

burgh or Cleveland.

Mentally armed, I ﬁnd myself
knocking, if not on heaven’s door,
on CBGB’s. First, the cover charge.

It would be outrageous for covers
here in Iron City. But 4 dollars at
CBGB’s is a Jimmy-the-Greek
gamble with rock history.
Certainly, there's a chance of
finding bands of unrepentent
mediocraity. But John Lennon, Bob
Dylan and Lou Reed all have tried
out their interpretations of punk
rock on this stage and CBGB’s has
become an elemental touchstone in

the music world. The stars may be

back tonight.

CBGB’s has all the problems of
most public places in New York
City——high prices, surly waitresses
and a run-down atmosphere. But it
does have an electricity, a sense of
vast talent and ragged emotions
boiling beneath the surface.

Talking Heads was playing the
night of my visit, and they are
probably a better representation of
what it means to be punk rockers
than Newsweek’s sordid babblings
of transvestite studs and leather
boys.

Talking Heads has a simple
working class persona—neat, unin-
dulgent musicians looking for an
alternative to life in the steel mills or
the construction industry. The punk
rock musicians’ and their audiences
are a good crosssection of David
Bowie’s young Americans—confus-
ed, slightly shiftless, embittered at
the- loss of neighborhood and
identity. Punk rock is white rock,

music that has come full circle from’

Elvis Presley’s rhythm and blues. It
still features guitar intensity, but is
now ﬂavored with a sense of

By DAN McKAY

Before a packed house at the
Stanley Theater, Ronnie Laws
proved without a doubt that he
could “do it all” on the saxaphone.

Opening his set with the funky
“Captain Midnight” from the
album “Fever,” Laws took the
audience through a tour of his great
musical virtuosity and variety of
styles, from the‘ boogying “Good-
time Ride” from his latest album,
“Friends and Stmagers” to the
subtle nuances of “Stay Still (and
Let Me I.ove You)” from“Fever.”

Most impressive was the expres-
sive, lyrical soprano sax lines Laws
masterfully carved on the latter
number. He packs a lot of emotional
punch in whatever he plays, but
“Stay Still” had to be the
knockout.Laws, in an interview
before the concert, that the soprano
is his favorite of all saxophones
because of its unique timbre.
Pressure, Law's band, opened the
tune with soft, sweet chords while
Laws talked to the audience about
life and love. “One of the greatest
parts (of life) is love. Do you agree
with that?” he asked. The crowd
responded
ranging from “Amen!” to“Alright,
brotherl”. After winning over the
hearts of the audience with his
beliefs, Laws hooked them with his
beautiful playing.

Speaking of his music Laws
said, ‘‘It’s an oulet for me; I enjoy
it a lot, but it's not number one.”
But his”family and God are. “My
lifestyle is guided basically by
Biblical principles.” These rinci-
ples translate into a very laid-back
approach, both in conversation and
onstage. Laws has a warm and
friendly air of imperturabilit)“

Throughout the performance,
Laws often switched between
soprano, alto and tenor saxaphones,
and played no bad notes on any of
them. When he wasn’t playing his
sax, he was busy shaking his
tambourine or beating other traps to
stay in the mainstream of the music.

Pressure, playing back-ups. Was
extremely tight together; they
reﬂected Law's laid-back manner,
even in the passages that cooked.

Chicago
Coming To
Arena

Chigago, one of the more
popular groups in modern music,
will make an appearnace in
Pittsburgh at the Civic Arena Oct.

S"In the late 1960s, when electric
bands and acid rock were in their
prime, Chicago presented a fresh.
vigorous, brass-oriented style that
became a big hit. Chicago has
been recognized for hits such as
“Does Anybody Really Know What
Time It Is?,” “Beginnings,” “25
or 6 to 4." Feeling Stonger Every
Day” and “If You Leave Me Now.”

Through their history, the group
has exhibited a variety of styles.
ranging from the lively guitar-and-
brass sound of “Beginnings” to
the mellow blendings of .“If You
Leave Me Now" to the vibrant
hard-rock and guitar of “25 or 6 to
4."

’1e-THE ~_l!TI

The band is composed of two

guitars, bass, keyboards and
drums. Laws believes “Friends and
Strangers, ’ ’ done with Pressure and
extra vocals, is “one of my best
albums.”

Ronnie Laws has had a broad
musical background; coming from a
musical family certainly was no
handicap. Speaking of inﬂuences in
his own style, he singled out John
Coltrane and Miles Davis, but
added “I’ve admired a loot of
people, a lot of artists, from blues to

actually trying to imitate them, but
just learning from them.”
Comparing his past experiences
and successes with his current
success and popularity, Laws said,
“I enjoyed the experiences I had
with them (Earth, Wind and Fire)
and I fully enjoy what I'm doing
now.” He pondered for a moment,
then continued. “To be able to be on
your own and be independent and
express yourself career-wise is a big
plus. I have no regrets.”

Public Theater

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Every day is Father’s Day.”

This line from the Pittsburgh
Public Theater’s production of
Oliver Hailey’s comedy “Father’s
Dat ’ ’ could refer to the commonness
of the plot development. Quite
simply, there is little, as the author
chooses to substitute brash ironies
and one-liners for character eval-
uation and deeper meaning.

The play opens in a luxuzry
apartment, where three divorced
women discuss their different
former and present life styles. Not
things like jobs or single life, but
more shocking topics like homosex-
uality, masturbation and love-
making techniques. Louise (the
hag) leads the way, and Miriam (the
blue-blood) and Estelle (the
innocent) supply sufficient subjects
for discussion.

In the second act, the
ex-husbands take over, touching on
the same subjects with as much
vulgarity. Tom, I.ouise’s husband,
discovers he’s been sterile since
birth and takes his wife and her son
to Iowa. Richard, Miriam’s
ex-spouse, who stills visits her
often, reveals he is bisexual but
enjoys living with his ex-wife as
much as he did when he .was

axaphone ‘F ather’s Day: ’ Strong
Acting, Shallow Plot

married, while Harold, Estelle’s
mate and co-orphan, announces he
plans to marry a DuPont (not the
rich one, he stresses).

One would think news like this
would have some serious effect on
the three women and the play in
general. But Hailey, who helps
write the TV satire “Mary
Hartman, Mary Hartman,” bails
himself out of meaningful messages
or stop-and-think morals by tossing
in vulgar name-calling and ironic

twists on speech so typical of 

television comedy he is part of.

In one section, when Louisa is
faced with losing her only son and
the ex-husband she still loves, there
is a confrontation between her and
Tom. Louise pours her heart out,
pleading with Tom to take her back.
“Please, please marry me
again—... l” she screams, crushing
a touching moment of under
standing between herself and the
audience.

Not that “Father’s Day” isn’t
funny; Hailey is able to i use
vulgarity, irony and shocking truth
to turn a typical play theme (_t,9*";e’
‘women in search of understanding
themselves) into an entertaining,
tantalizing comedy, creating truly

Presidents’ Voices Keep Frye Going

By NANCY J. WINTNER
Pitt News Staff Writer-

Impressionists Rich Little, Fred
Travalena, and Frank Gorshin may
impersonate prominent politicians
but David Frye was the first.

“I was the first one to do Nelson
Rockerfeller, George Wallace, Lyn-
end B. Johnson, Ted Kennedy,
Henry Kissinger and William
Buckley," Frye, 43, said. “Others
began to use them in their routines
after me.”

Born in Brooklyn, Frye’s show
business career began while he was
working for his father at the Anchor
Ofﬁce Cleaning Co.

Every time Humphrey Bogart
answered the phone, startled
cleaning company customers would
hang up and dial again, only.to be
greeted by Sidney Greenstreet.
Frye’s job lasted only a week and a
half.

Frye entertained at Greenich
Village coffeehouses and small
nightclubs before moving up to the
big time.

Although Frye’s been’imperson-
ating politicians and entertainers
for 20 years, it was only in the last
decade that he began performing
professionally. A

To adjust his voice to sound
exactly like those of celebrities
requires a certain “knack" or
ability. Frye said. He emphasized
that training one's vocal chord
muscles is very important.

“The more you exercise them.
the better you become."

Although "The Tonight Show"
was responsible for boosting Frye’s

career, he also appeared on other
television shows such as Merv
Griffin, Ed Sullivan, and “The
Smothers Brothers,” which contri-
buted to his national acclaim.

His public exposure led to
favorable articles written in News-
week and Time magazine.

With other professional impres-
sionists such as Rich Little on the
circuit today. Frye agrees there is
competition.

“But there’s always competition
in anything you do. Rich Little
concentrates more on the entertain-
ment people. ﬂ He does many
singing impressions.”

Frye complimented Little on his
“fantastic” success. He added
that he will never sing in his act
simply because, he says, “I can’t
sing.”

Although he currently does 75
impressions. Frye said he gets the
biggest response from his Nixon
and Jimmy Carter impersonations.

“I enjoy doing Nixon and
Carter." he said. “I like to choose
tlieose people who are always in
the news. They are the most
interesting."

Among his list of many personal-
ities include Kirk Douglas. Howard
Cosell. George Wallace. Billy
Carter. Lyndon Johnson. Tom
Snyder. Henry Kissinger. Walter
Kronkite. and Carl Malden.

"I \started to include Robert
Blake. Maude and Telly Savalas in

to my act. But sometimes it's hard
to keep abreast of television
personalities."

Frye has not only performed his

   

routine on television or before
night club audiences. but also for
those particular celebrities he
imitates.

“William Buckley's wife told
me. if Bill ever goes away. you can
do the short version.”

After performing at a dinner in
Washington years ago. Hubert
Humphrey approached Frye and
complimented him or his perfor-
mance. “I’m really proud you can
make us laugh,” he said.

Frye writes about 95 percent of
his material. including many of the
satirical spoofs he does of today’s
commercials.

"Sometimes I can write a couple
of routines in one night.” he said.

 

“But it depends on the creativity at
the moment.”

Frye’s current projects include
marketing his latest album of
Jimmy Carter impressions and
making arrangements for a televi-
sion special in the near future.

In the backstage

inteaviexv
Wednesday evening at 

Lawrence Hall. Frye’s energenic.
personable stage personality
changed to high-strung nervous-
ness. The entertainer. who
shortened his performance by 10
minutes that evening. apologized
for his off-stage behavior indica-
ting he had high blood pressure
and was quite tired from traveling
and the days activities

classical.” He said he was “not
commercialism in musical freedom
of creativity, Laws" emphasized that
“I have relative freedom to record,
pick and choose the music I want to
put out.”

The future goals Laws has set for
himself may surprise some, but
they ﬁt his Christian beliefs. He
says he would like to stay home
more with his wife Karmen and
their children, produce other
musician’s albums and help other

sﬁgwrrouns. If his track record is any

hilarious and original lines and

But at times, the humor becomes
axbit silly. Miriam’s tale of sexual
fetishes concerning high-heeled
shoes she saw in an A & P and
Estelle’s rememberance of how,
she, an orphan, used to sneak into
homes of large families, undis-
covered until after she was
mistakenly fed and bathed, are
totally foolish and unrealistic.

The acting is excellent, with
Broadway actress Elaine Kerr (the
evil Loretta Simpson on the
television opera Another World) her
catty best as Louise. Kerr lives the
part, so much so that one forgets
this is a production and not real life.

Sharon Laughlin is wonderfully
uppity as Miriam. Laughlin, who

character she portrays.

Monica Merryman is wide-eyed
and inquiring as the innocent
Estelle, anovice to the world of
divorce. Merryman is convincingly
introverted, soothing the roughness

of the other characters.

Robert Murch (Richard), Ivar

adding character to smaller,

Director Michael Flannagan does
an admirable job of combining the
ﬁne acting, good lighting and

attempt as can be made with a play
that is commonly shallow.

Gaustad’s Wish A Passing One

By KAREN KADILAK

Pitt News Staff Writer

If you happen to come across a
penny lying in the street, don’t
touch it—-call Pitt football player
Steve Gaustad. If you happen to
see a shining star, for heaven's

~< We‘, don’t wish upon it .prema-

turely. Instead, call Steve

Gaustad.

Gaustad has a very important
wish to make on behalf of the Pitt
football team.

He, is hoping the Pitt passing
game, seldom used since Matt
Cavanaugh went down with a
fractured wrist in the Panthers’
season opener against Notre Dame
three weeks ago, gets back on track
tomorrow afternoon against Boston
College

Why would a football team, a
defending national champion team
at that, and one of its up-and-com-
ing players resort to a bit of wishful

jg   in g ?

The answer is simple. The
Panthers have failed to get their
passing game cranked up the way
they would like it. With freshman
Rick Trocano playing quarterback.
Pitt head coach Jackie Sherrill and

offensive coordinator Bob Leahy _

have gone with a simpliﬁed offense
that places a heavy emphasis on
rushing and a minimal one on
passing. Although this type of
offense has paid dividends for the
Panthers in the last two weeks

 have won both games, 29-6

if over William and Mary and 76-0

over Temple), it hasn't given Pit
the balanced offense Sherrill
desires.

Neither has it given Gaustad
much of a chance to catch the
football, something he was ex-
pected tod o a lot of when
Cavanaugh threw the football.
In three games, the junior from
New Cumberland, Pa. has caught a
similar number of passes. A paltry
number for tne starting tight end
on a supposedly pass-oriented

,» - 53am‘
; Although the junior admits he is

’”disappointed" because he hasn’t
caught the ball as much as he
would like, he isn't downright
disheartened. After Saturday’s

Temples Owls, may not see action in
tomorrow’s contest against Boston
College. Wilson photo

76-0 pasting of Temple by the
Panthers, Gaustad sees things
getting better.

Against Temple, Pitt passers
ever started to look his way for
things other than ﬁnding room to
run.

‘ ‘I think they tried to throw to me
more often last week,” Gaustad
said enthusiastically. “Trouble
was we really didn’t have that
much of a chance to pass the ball.
We were inside the 20 three times.
You don’t need to throw much
when you're in there.

“We were just driving it down
their throats,” Gaustad added. “I
think we". scored every time we had

\. Delaney Makes Name

ByJIMI.EWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer
For once this season, the name

Lindsay Delany is being mentioned
seriously.

Not just as an aside, mind you,

but in the same sentence as the

phrase “starting lineup.

The hip pointer freshman quart-
erback Rick Trocano suffered in last
week's 76-0 bombardment of
Temple may be enough to force the
placement of Delany, another
freshman, into the slot against
Boston College tomorrow, Pitt head
coach Jackie Sherrill explained at
Tuesday’s press conference.

“If he (Trocano) doesn’t practice

this week we’ll have to replace
him,” Sherrill claimed.

“If he
doesn’t play, then it will be Delany
in the starting lineup.”

Delany? The same Delany that
was referred to merely as a “good
player to have around during these
injury problems” by Sherrill? What

the ball inside the 40. But they did
try to throw to me. One was
knocked down, one Rick (Trocano)
threw behind me and one I caught
for 30 yards.”

But, there’s room for improve-
ment, a fact Sherrill readily
concedes.

“We’re still trying to enlarge
and expand our passing. game,"
Sherrill pointed out. “We’re doing.
some things now where ‘we’re
hoping we get better each week.”

Gaustad hopes to see improve-
ment tomorrow in Boston. In the
meantime, he’s still looking for that
penny or star.

For Himself

Cavanugh, the man Trocano
replaced— isn’t he well enough to
step back in?

“Cavanaugh is back working at
practice,” Sherrill said. “He threw
the ball a little, but he won’t be able
to play until X-rays show his arm
has healed.”

Cavanaugh and Trocano aren’t

the only casualities who may miss
Saturday’s contest. Defensive line-
backer Dave DiCiccio will be out for
10 days with a broken finger, also
acquired against Temple. .
“That's one guy we didn’t want
to lose this week ,” Sherrill stated.
“Now we’ll have to move people
around or put a freshman into that
spot.”
Which is bad, considering the
very good

But Eagle coach Joe Yukika won’t
brag.

“Against Tennessee two weeks
ago (a 24-18 Volunteer win ) we
didn’t run well at a.l]—35 yards
total,” he claimed. “Last week
against Army we did better, al-
though the caliber of the team was
different.

“Pitt’s linebacking group is
tough, ’ ’Yukika continued.‘ ‘They're
well-balanced, with not too many
weaknesses.”

Last year’s linebacking crewwas
one of the best in the nation. Can
this season's squad match an aerial
attack not yet seen by the Panther
defense in the young campaign?

“At fall camp, we played against
Cavanaugh, ” Pitt linebacking
coach Fozie Fazio stressed. “We
worked against our own good
offense—that brought maturity and
experience to our group.

"If someone gets hurt. we're not
afraid to put in others like Jeff
Pelusi, Desmond Robinson or Steve
Fedell,” Fazio added. “We're
quite fortunate that our defense has
been able to rise to the occasion in
our past three games.”

If the defense can do that
Saturday, Delany—if he starts-
may earn his first quarterbaeking
victory.

The Pitt soccer team (2-2-1) gets

tonight at Pitt Stadium, where it
will meet the Temple Owls (0-2), a

called on them.-.

Former high school teammates
Mary Lou Susang and Mary Savage
shared duties at the other setting
position.

“I was quite pleased with our
performance," said Herbert. “but"
we still have a lot of mistakes to Iron
out.”

The Pantherettes must attend to
those’ mistakes by Friday, when
they host the Pitt Invitational. The
tournament will include eight of the
top 16 teams in the East, and will be
Pitt’s first major challenge of the
year.

While Pitt hopes to fare well in its
ﬁrst tournament Herbert has his
sights set on another big tourna-
ment.

time,” he said, “but we want to

all-America Bill Sauter, Jack Dietz,
George Lesyw, Joe Steffa and the
top high school player in the
Philadelphia suburbs last year,
Scott Land.

Temple's biggest problem has
been its inability to score goals. The
Owls’ goal production stands at
zero—both losses were shutouts by
Rider College and East Stroudsburg
State.

Pitt coach Leo Bemis summed up
Temple’s plight:

“They have outstanding talent,
but they’re struggling to score
goals,” he said

Pitt enters the game. having
recently defeated the Carnegie

Mellon Tartans, 5-0. The Panthers
don’t appear to be suffering from
the offensive inadequacies that
have hurt Temple. Pitt already has
scored 15 goals this year, which is
five more than it registered all of
last season.

But Bemis pointed out that his
team has done much of its scoring
against weaker teams, so the
Temple game will provide some
answers to the question of Pitt’s
capabilities. He also said it will
take a great team effort to bring
down Temple.

“We have to find out now if we
can score against the good teams
on our schedule,” Bemis said.

According to Bemis, the play of
defensemen Karl Nigh and Dan
Hamm has been exceptional, while
Marty Moyer and Bob Hughes lead
the scoring with three goals apiece.
John O’Hara has registered two
tallies thus far, and Goalie Frank
Bucci will be seeking his third
shutout in six games when he takes
to the nets tonight.

Panﬂierette Netters Gust  

Past Slippery Rock, 8-1

By CINDY N ATALI

The Pantherette tennis team
prevailed over a visiting Slippery
Rock team and gusty winds on the
courts last Monday, winning 8-1.

Sweeping all but one match from
their rivals, the team “played very
well,” according to assistant coach
Erma Pytka.

“Slippery Rock has a good
team,” she stressed. “It was good
competition for us.”

Winning her match in the sixth
singles position with a tiebreaker,
Jan Brownstein added a little
tension to the game. she won her
match over Ann Linton, 6-1, 7-6.

First-singles player Maria Paris
beat Ellen Cames» in straight sets,
6-0, 6-1. Jan Decostro shut out
Snelson, 6-0, 6-0, while third-
singles player Janice Irwin downed
Sherri Young, 6-4, 6-2.

Nancy Bellistreri dropped her
contest, 4-6, 3-6, to Cathy Pﬁster,
but Pam Bachman picked up a 6-1,
6-1, triumph over Ronnie Fuiyera.

With a Pitt victory already
assured, all the doubles teams won
in straight sets. Irwin and
Bachman downed Cindy Nadelman
and Holly Weber, 6-1, 6-2.
Bellistreri and Brownstein backed
up the win with a 6-1, 6-2 triumph
over Jackie Breegle and Kathy
Eckendorf. Freshmen Bernadette
McNally and Jennifer Mullan
finished off Chris Lorence Korb,
6-4, 6-3.

excited about having the oppor-
tunity to play in last week's season
opener.

‘‘I just wanted to make the
team,” she said. ‘‘I haven’t done
too much in the way of competitive
tennis. My game is improving
already, but Ihope to strengthen my
serving and forehand.”

Pytka, who has helped the team
unofﬁcially for the past couple of
years, has been working on the
squad’s serves—especially those of
the new pliyers. “I enjoy coaching
very much,” she said. “The girls
are easy to work with.”

Next stop for the Pantherettes is‘

New York. This is the first
tournament for the Pitt team this
season, and will run from Friday
through Sunday, with about 45
teams participating. The top six
singles players and their coaches

after a match with Indiana.
Making the trip are Paris,

Harriers Prepare
For Penn State,

West Virginia "5 

By MARIA SCIULLO

Cross country meets usually
don’t generate much intensity
among teams. The regional
closeness of Penn State and West
Virginia University, however, has
sparked such rivalry that tomor-
row’s double-dual meet could be
some what of a grudge match.

The Panthers would like nothin§&!..._

better than to repeat their 1975
upset of the Nittany Lions. This
year, Penn State does not have as
many individual stars as in recent
seasons, but it still is a team with
great overall talent. WVU may lack
the depth necessary to beat either
Pennsylania team, but still has
several outstanding runners.

Pitt's Bob Lee said the Panthers
may have a definite home-course
advantage. “Wehave a really tough
course,” he said, “and it helps that
we’re used to it.”

The race begins on Flagstaff Hill
at 11 am. It will be followed by the

By BOB LABRIOLA

Following in the fine tradition
of Oakland vs. Pittsburgh and the
Phillies vs. the Pirates. the Pitt
water polo team renews its rivalry
with Bucknell today at Lewisburg
in the first conference match for
both squads.

Since Miguel Rivera became the
coach at Pitt. the Panthers hold a
4-2 edge over their nemesis.
However. Bucknell gained an upset
victory over Pitt just last week, en
r§>ut€ to capturing last weekend's

 jilnvitational.

In traveling to Bucknell. the
Panthers will have to cope not only
with the Bisons’ physical defense.
but a considerably smaller pool.
This would normally necessitate
some defensive changes. but
because of the outstanding per-
formance of goalie Steve Feller,
Rivera is confident the team will be
able to adjust to the smaller pool.

Much of the furor over the
inadequacy of Invitational referees
has died. since Pitt has been
assured top-quality officials for
weekend's match with Bucknell
with either prove my point or make

 |t’s0fficial--Pitt vs. B

us look very silly, but I still
maintain that with goodcfficials,
Bucknell cannot beat us.”

Robert Simonetti may get his
first start of the season, as Rivera
feels his combination of speed and
powerful shot will be an advantage
in the smaller pool. With this lone
exception, Pitt will operate out of
the same offense it used through-
out the Invitational.

“Since we throw everyone into
the offense. we’re vulnerable to the
fast break.” Rivera explained.
“and the only way to protect
ourselves is to put the ball into the

Friday, September 30, 1977-TI-IE PITT NEWS-Pa8¢ 15

net. We’ll be shooting from a little
farther out than normal, because of
the smaller pool and the fact that
the Bucknell goalie is only average
at best.”

Rivera cited the play of freshman
Dave Diaz, Mike Mere and George
Machicote as high points of the
Invitational. Machicote scored
over 20 goals for the Panthers over
the weekend. “No one can steal
the ball from George without
fouling,” Rivera said.

“Luis Tom has not been scoring
many goals for us, but he is our
playmaker; he controls the tempo

uckneﬂ

and makes things happen.” Rivera
added. “At least six of
Machicote’s goals came on feed-.
from Tom.

“We were a little overconﬁdent
after we beat Indiana and that let
Bucknell get an early lead on us. I
don't think that will be a problem
this time. I think we’ll be ready,”
Rivera said.

After Fri‘day’s match with the
Bisons, Pitt will remain in
Lewisburg for Saturday matches
with Richmond and Cornell. It will
be the Panthers’ ﬁrst appearance
this year against either team.

batting champion Rod Carew. who

has more base hits than any other
major leaguer in more than 40
years? Would you turn »down
Richie Zisk. who almost single-
handedly kept the Chicago White
Sox in the pennant race for five
months? Would you reject RBI
leaders like Larry Hisle and Bobby
Bonds, just because their teams
didn’t ﬁnish first?

If you like a New York Yankee for
the award. do you go for slugger
Reggie Jackson. with 32 homers
and 109 runs batted in, or slugger
Craig Nettles, with 37 homers and
104 RBIs? Or do you reject both of
them for speedster Mickey Rivers“.
leading the club in hitting with a
.325 average? Don’t forget reliever
Sparky Lyle whose 13 victories and
26 saves, give him a piece of one
third of his teams wins.

Suppose you thought a Boston
player ought to win. How would
you choose between Jim Rice’s

200-plus hits. which include a
league-leading 38 home runs and
well over 100 RBIs, and Carl
Yastrzemski. Carlton Fisk and Bill
Campbell. who’ve all had superla-
tive seasons.

Baltimore’s candidate is Ken
Singleton. the only Oriole enjoying
a truly outstanding season and the
man who kept his club in the
pennant race. I-Ie’s among the
league’s leading hitters at .325.

Kansas City’s man‘has been Al
Cowens, who’s been his club's top
run producer with 111 and is hitting
.310.

So there they are. How do you
vote for one? Maybe you don’t.
Maybe instead, you’re on the
committee to select the National
League Cy Young Award. Lucky
you.

Start the Cy Young selection by
setting a criteria. Let’s say you’re
partial to 20-game winners. Then

Sunday, Octoba 9 is

WD VE Night

you must rule out San Diego
reliever Rollie Fingers, with 34
saves but a mere eight victories of
his very own.

And the 20-win club is crowded.
There’s Rick Reusehel of the
Chicago Cubs and Bob Forsch of
the St. Louis Cardinals. both
longshots because they never made
this race before.

How about Pittsburgh’s John
Candelaria and Larry Chnistenson
of Philadelphia with 19 and 18
victories. respectively? Aren’t they
legitimate candidates?

Then there’s Cincinnati’s Tom
Seaver, who survived tumultous,_
almost unbelievable pressure to
achieve his usual level of excel-
lence, and Steve Carlton of
Philadelphia. Both are past
winners and Carlton might have
the additional edge of pitching for a
division champion.
