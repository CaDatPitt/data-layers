Domestic
violence
results in
stabbing

By Suzann Gries
News Editor

The victim of a stabbing col-
lapsed in the courtyard between
Forbes Quadrangle and Hillman
Library yesterday afternoon.

Police identified the victim as
Anthony Davis of Oakland.
Davis was stabbed at the corner
of Forbes and Meyran Avenues
and ran to the Forbes
Quadrangle area before finally
passing out.

A Pitt professor and a student,
both of whom asked not to be
identified, called the campus
police when they saw Davis

lying near the yellow metal ~

sculpture.

Campus police said they
received the call at 4:50 p.m.
and responded immediately.
They administered first aid until
city police and paramedics
arrived and transported the vic-
tim to Presbyterian University
Hospital, according to assistant
director of Public Safety Gary
Moses.

Davis, who is believed to be
in his late ‘30s, is in critical con-
dition in the trauma center of
the Intensive Care Unit with a
stab wound in the left side of
his lower back, according to
Moses and hospital personnel.

When the officers arrived at
Forbes Quadrangle, Davis, who
was lying face down, said
another man had stabbed him,
according to police.

Following up on Davis’ story,
investigating officers returned to
the crime scene at Forbes and
Meyran Avenues and talked to a
young woman who identified
herself as the daughter of the
assailant.

T OCC questions public safety commitment

By Mike Lyczko
Staff Writer

Oakland residents questioned whether
enough priority is given to public safety in
the planning of Oakland’s future at a town
meeting last night sponsored by Oakland
Directions, Inc. and Oakland Planning and
Development Corporation.

An Oakland property-owner and Pitt staff
member said he had the option of living in
Oakland but wondered about the safety of
Oakland for his 13—year-old son.

“There’s not a lot of incentive to bring my
eighth—grader into the neighborhood. I’d
like to live in Oakland. I like the diversity
and the eccentric people, but I don’t like
the people who harass,” the man, who pre-

ferred to remain anonymous, said.

He said he had witnessed two of the
recent shootings, which occurred during
daylight. He added that he is an advocate
for community youth programs.

Another public safety issue at the meeting
was the arrest powers of Pitt police beyond
Pitt property.

Recent articles in the Post-Gazette that
implied campus police were shackled in
pursuing criminals are a misinterpretation,
according to assistant vice chancellor for
business John DeVitto.

“We’re sworn to uphold the law and get
the bad guys and send them to jail. If we’re
told there’s a robbery, and they run to
Schenley Park, we’ll chase them. It’s busi-
ness as usual,” DeVitto said‘. “If we see a

criminal, we’re going to stop them.”

Pitt has hired eight officers and five more
will be hired in the coming year, according
to DeVitto. “We’re on solid ground. We
won’t let felonies go on,” DeVitto said.
“People should go [to the Pitt policel if they
have a problem.” He said that a substation
will be put in for use by Pitt police and the
city police.

Wfhen a resident claimed that of the mil-
lions of dollars mentioned for various pro-
jects, nothing is mentioned about police

officers, Commonwealth Relations Director '

Dennis McManus said, “These details of

public safety have little to do with decisions 4

involving space.”

New lighting system to improve campus safety, says De Vitto

By Mike Lyczko
Staff Writer

Pitt has installed a new out-
door lighting system in hopes of
improving safety on campus.

“If you saw them, you
wouldn’t ask the question,”
John DeVitto, assistant vice
chancellor for business and
finance said when asked if Pitt’s
new lighting system improved
security.

The lights were installed out-
side of The Frick Fine Arts
Building, I-Iillman Library,
William Pitt Union, Cathedral of

Learning and Heinz Chapel.

Shahla Eberhardt, former
public safety chair for the
Student Government Board,
said the lighting issue was
already being worked on by the
SGB when her term started in
March 1992.

“They’re wonderful. People
have really noticed them, and
I’ve received a lot of positive
comments,” Eberhardt said.

‘They haven’t solved [the secu-

rity problem] entirely, but they
help. They’re an added security
measure — but nothing can be
complete.”

“We picked it up and worked
on it [until it was approved]. We
give credit to a lot of different
people,” she said. ”[Pittl did a
really good job, and I thank
them for their cooperation.”

Eberhardt said .\ll€ would like
to see security lighting extended
to more areas, such as up on the
hill by the fraternities.

“The lights are metal halide,
175 watts each. They’re a gener-
ally—used, high—efficiency lamp
for outdoor lighting. The cost to
operate them is a little less than
regular incandescent bulbs,”
Glenn Avick, director of engi-

neering and construction, said.

Groundbreaking was in April,
but city of Pittsburgh approval
took twice as long as the con-
struction, since most of the
buildings are registered l~i.<tori-
cal landmarks and the new
lights had to meet certain speci-
fications.

“They had to match the archi-
tectural and historical structure
of the landmark. You can’t have
styles that clash. That’s why
they have a turn—of—the-century
style,” john Morgan, assistant
director for transportation, said.

Once the lighting was

approved by Pitt, the city’:
Historic Review Commissior
had to review the proposal
according to Deborah Rouse, ar
architect who is associate direc-
tor of planning at Pitt.

“A significant portion 0
Oakland is within the Oaklanc

Civic Historic District.“They art - it

concerned that any new con
struction doesn’t detract from

the historical character,” Rouse‘

said.

Small changes can often be‘-
approved relatively quickly at a 5

staff level, Rouse said, but sig

Pitt buildings may not fall

By Jack Finn

Asst. News Editor

The ultimate fate of two of Pitt’s
oldest buildings has yet to be
decided and may not be for years
to come, according to L. Thomas
Hussey, associate vice chancellor
for Facilities Management.

Pennsylvania Hall and the
Mineral Industries Building, report-
ed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to
be slated for demolition, are still
being evaluated for alternative
fates.

“The O’Connor administration
has been very participatory in the
decision-inaking process, and any
decision on the fate of these build-
ings will include a number of
groups, such as the University
Planning and Budget Committee,
the master planning committee and
the Senate Plant Utilization and
Planning Committee," Hussey said.

The School of Rehabilitation and

Health Sciences, the occupant at.

Pennsylvania Hall, plans to move
to the Iroquois Building when ren-

ovations are completed there in
1995.

The Mineral Industrial Bt1ilding’s
main occupant, the computer sci-
ence department, will move to a
new academic complex on Forbes
Avenue and Bouquet Street when
that complex is completed in early
1997.

The university spends about
$260,000 a year on operations and
maintenance for the two buildings,
according to Hussey, but would
face renovation costs of over $5
million if the buildings were to be
modernized.

The School of Rehabilitation and
Health sciences won’t be out soon
enough, according to associated
director Wesley Rohrer, III. “The
building is leaking, crumbling, the
ventilation system is antiquated,”
Rohrer said.

The new facility will double the
schools’ useable space, according
to Rohrer. A

The decision on the fates of the
buildings won’t be made for at least
two years, said Hussey.

SAC still waiting

By Mike Lyczko
Staff Writer

The Staff Association Council said it has not received a
response from Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor to its
letter requesting that the recent benefits enacted for
same-sex couples be extended to different—sex couples.

“We have received no response from the chancellor.
He made the final decision [on the benefitsl, and we
have asked him to reconsider and extend the beneﬁts to
different—sex couples,” SAC President Darlene Harris
said. SAC’s original proposal called for the benefits to
extend to all domestic partners.

Neither O’Connor’s office nor Pitt administrators could
be reached for comment.

To qualify as a domestic partnership under the exist-
ing policy, Pitt employees who have same-sex partners
must sign an affidavit attesting to specific facts. They
must cohabitate in a mutually caring, committed and
ﬁnancially interdependent partnership that has been in
existence for at least two years. This policygwent into
effect on July 1.

Council members also discussed proposed changes in
the grievance procedure at a June 14 meeting. The old
procedure was a f1ve—level process, while the new one
will have four, according to Human Resources Director

John Wilds. “This takes Human Resources out of the

loop as far as being judgmental about a complaint, so
Human Resources becomes a facilitator. The role of
Human Resources will change substantially,” Wilds said.

nificant projects such as the
lighting fixtures take a lot of
planning and presentation.

“We work back-and-forth at
the staff level. Finally, a presen-
tation is made before the full
Historic Review Commission.
We went in with drawings of
fixtures, sketches, and other
details. We even brought in an

example of the light fixture, '

which is over three feet in
length,” Rouse explained. “It’s a
careful design process. We were
careful to enhance the historic
image.”

Discussions with the city start-
ed in Inid-fall of 1992. Final
approval came in mid-March,
Rouse said.

Although six'months may
seem like a long time, Rouse
said that actually “this was
approved very quickly. A lot of
hard work by the university, the
city and the manufacturer was
involved. Our relationship with
the Historic Review Commission
is very good. It is very coopera-
tive and we have very produc-
tive discussions.”

As for the lights’ effect on
security, Assistant Director of
Public Safety Gary Moses said
“it’s too soon to tell anything
substantial [about differences in
crime rates]. But there hasn’t

"been any crime in those areas

since the lights were installed.”

There has been no vandalism

of the lights, according to
DeVitto. '

“They burn brightly and
enhance the campus. It really
does do a job,” he said.

It's an idea whose time has come.

It's the new IBM PSNaIuePoint line of
computers——they're all lull-featured, all
industry standard, and all very

what it wants despite community opposition in such issues as
the convocation center. .

McManus said, “Now that funding is available, we will con-
tinue to insist that the building [convocation center] be built.
But the community has input into the evolution of this.
Whether or not the university is just paying lip service we’ll
find out through this process.”

“The hope is we’ll get a variety of views,” Caroline Boyce,
executive director of OPDC, said. “There are some in the
community who support the convocation center, while oth-
ers are against it.”

“The University of Pittsburgh has embraced cooperation
with the Oakland community in an unprecedented way. On
behalf of the university community, we look forward to
working together,” McManus said.

Addressing questions about the role of public safety in
future planning, Boyce said the Oakland community groups
will give serious thought to task forces devoted to public
safety, I

Come out ﬁghting?

After approximately seven months of working toward
allowing homosexuals in the military the freedom to
acknowledge their sexuality publicly, President Clinton
has finally announced his proposal. His proposal has
been termed by many the “don’t ask, don’t tell, don’t
pursue” policy.

According to the newpolicy guidelines, no longer will
applicants for service be asked if they are homosexual
or bisexual. ‘

Also, the plan specifically statesthat “sexual orienta-
tion will not be a bar to service unless manifested by
homosexual conduct.”

The military will also not be permitted to conduct
investigations solely for the purpose of finding out a
person’s sexual orientation.

Homosexual conduct is defined as “a homosexual act,
a statement that the member is homosexual or bisexual
or a marriage or attempted marriage to someone 
same gender,” as stated in the new policy. , 0 

Soldiers are permitted to march in gay pride parades,
read homosexual literature or go to gay bars as long as
they are not in uniform. The policy also states that
“harassment according to sexual orientation will not be
tolerated.

 

The issue may seem to be simply gays against the .

Pentagon, but what actually is happening is a violation
of civil rights. ’

With the ban, not every American is guaranteed the
same freedoms that we all are guaranteed. As they are
denied the right to acknowledge who they are, gays and
lesbians also lose the Freedom of Speech.

Although the plan may not be the best solution,
Clinton has taken the first steps necessary to gain total
acceptance. The compromise might lead to increased
legal action which may be beneficial in lifting of the
ban. The policy will now be examined through legal
and constitutional lenses compared to simply a political
one.

The plan also makes it difficult for the Pentagon to
prosecute gays who have been ousted. Rather, gays that
are discharged will finally have a justifiable court case:
they were kicked out simply due to their sexual orienta-
tion, with no proof of actual homosexual activity. Now
the Pentagon will have to prove that a person’s sexuali-
ty interfered with their military performance. Then they
may be justifiably discharged or dishonorably dis-
charged.

The first step is always the most difficult. Even though
in the military gays are stillnot granted the same civil
rights as heterosexuals, the plan is a good start.

As Gerry Studds, a representative from Massachusetts,
stated, “It’s a small step, but Clinton was able to do
something that makes life less awful, or less unbearable,
for some gays and lesbians.” '

Rape is not just Bosnia's problem .

Since the beginning of time, war has existed.
Since the beginning of war, rape has occurred.

Now we hear about the occurrence of rape in
the former Yugoslavia. According to Jodi Longo,
deputy director of the Mid-Atlantic Regional
Office for Amnesty International, between 20,000
and 50,000 women have been raped during this
war.

One surprise about the war in Bosnia is that the
occurrence of rape as a method of warfare has
been reported and condemned by leaders and
citizens worldwide. This pub-

There are many women within our own Pitt
community whose personal sense of safety has
been permanently shattered during the past few
years. I >

One such woman is a Pitt student who was
studying in Forbes Quad two years ago when a
man forced her to go outside into the nearby
baseball field and sexually assaulted her.

Another woman is a Pitt student who awoke
one night last fall in her North Oakland apart-
ment to find a man standing over her in the dark.
Two years ago another

licity is a novelty. It has taken a
few thousand years for rape as
a means of warfare, or warfare
as an excuse for rape, to be
named as wrong.

Bianca
Stoner

Pitt student was walking home
from a fraternity party near the
stadium when a man
approached her on the steps
coming down the hill and

So many Americans deplore
the rape situation in Bosnia and
say that the raping rampages are genocide.
Women should not be pawns in men’s war
games.

_What hypocrites we all are to pretend that the
situation in Bosnia is so terrible that it could not
happen in our own country where people are so
civilized and wonderful. It’s wrong tosay that we

' do not live in a warfare zone of our own. We call

the Bosnian rapes terrible‘ and disgraceful, yet we
go about our daily routines of protecting our-
selves without thinking twice, without getting
angry that it is necessary to be afraid just because
we are women.

In our society, there is an unofficial curfew on
women that says that if we are outside after dark,
then any harm that may befall us is our own fault.

We have to mentally check what we are wear-
ing to make sure that some guy will not interpret
our style of dress as “sexy,” and therefore, an
invitation to help himself to what he wants from
us. We live in a society where we need to have
multiple locks on our doors, carry whistles on
our keychains and hide cans of Mace in our purs-
es.

We even have to think about scheduling a pri-
vate meeting with a male professor, teaching
assistant or advisor, for fear of what may happen
if we are alone with an authority figure who
becomes a little too friendly. These precautions
are so common that most women do not even
think twice abr mi having to adhere to these unof-
ficial guidelines.

Since our country is not at war, there should be
no reason for one half of our citizens to live in
fear of what will happen to them if they let down
their guard for even a second.

raped her.

AnotherPitt student two
years ago was in her South Oakland apartment
and opened the door to find a man with weapons
who tried to rape her.

A Pitt student living in Holland Hall last year
was raped by a man whom she had trusted
enough to bring to her dorm room.

Many other Pitt students have been raped.
Statistics show that one in four college women
are raped.Imagine your four closest female
friends, and then imagine one of them will proba-
bly be raped.

We cannot deplore rape in a distant land
against women who we do not know when the
situation in our own country, even on our own
campus, is just as sickening.

War is just one of the many excuses that men
use to justify rape. If every American woman and
man who has deplored the situation in Bosnia
would take the time to look around them, they
would realize that we live in a war zone of our
own.

If every person who was angered over the
rapes in Bosnia was just as mad over the precau-
tions that all women must take, we begin taking
control of our lives.We cannot condemn rape in
another country until we condemn it in our own.

We must turn the feminist adage of “the per-

Potter’s ‘Orlando’ crisp and egaging fist fairy tale

By Bill Kirchner
Entertainment Editor

Orlando

Written and directed by Sally
Potter

Starring Tilda Swinton, Billy
Zane and Quentin Crisp

To call Sally Potter’s Orlando
a feminist fairytale might be sell-
ing the film short. But what else
would you call a film whose
heroine (hero at first) goes from
a young nobleman granted
favors and property by the
dying Queen Elizabeth I, to los-
ing those rights and property in
the 18th century on the discov-
ery that he is actually a female
and finally emerging in this cen-
tury having lost everything but
finding herself?

A tall tale indeed, but a
poignant one as well. Potter is
certainly not afraid of Virginia
Woolf, whose novel was the
basis for Orlando.

The most difficult task, as
Potter acknowledges, was to
translatelthe “abstraction and
arbitrariness” of the book into
something compelling on
screen. For Potter “cinema is
more pragmatic” and "there had
to be reasons -— however flimsy
— to propel us along a jour-
ney.”

And they are exactly that:
flimsy. To explain away the fact
that Orlando (Tilda Swinton)
never ages in her romp through
the centuries, Potter has Queen
Elizabeth (Quentin Crisp) tell
her to never grow old. Potter
also has Orlando turn down the
chance to marry and retain her
inheritance in perhaps the film’s
most ideologically symbolic
turn.

Far more compelling than this
is the wit and grace of the pic-

Gender benders Quentin Crisp and Tilda Swinton in Sally Potter’s ‘Orlando.’

ture itself. Early on, Orlando
addresses the audience directly
as Potter, throughout the film,
to give us the sense that bound-
aries can and will be broken.
There is a constant gag against
the patriarchy with Orlando
often running up against bald-
ing, pretentious and insidious
males trying to justify them-

selves and their power. The
humor is highbrow and clever.
Shot on location in England,
St. Petersburg and Uzbekhistan,
Orlando is about as lush as a
visual experience you’ll see on
film. If some of the scenes
remind you of a Peter
Greenaway film, congratulate
yourself. Potter employed two

of his production designers for

Orlando.

Besides Tilda Swinton’s
engaging presence as Orlando,
Potter scores a coup in casting
Quentin Crisp as the dying
queen. Crisp, perhaps Britain’s
most famous homosexual and
the “Queen of Queens” accord-

ing to Potter, sets the gender-

bending spirit of Woolfs story
in motion. Lets not forget that
the real Virgin Queen was quite
an androgynous figure herself.
Again, the blurring of bound-
aries, though witty and playful.
add up to an honest effort tc
free our preconceived screen
notions and accept the very
meaningful fantasy that is
Orlando.

You could argue that if Potter
and others were really con-
cerned with the plight of
women they’d be working to
get equal pay and the like
instead of making highbrow
fairytales. This is probably the
best criticism of Potter’s choice
in adapting Orlando and begs a
bigger question of the role of art
and feminism in film. For all the
intelligence of Orlando, it
seems unlikely that the film’s
commentary would trickle
down and make any difference
to the average woman. Just the
idea of ideology and power
trickling down to the masses
would be ironic coming from an
unempowered minority.

As a feminist vehicle, Or/andc
may be open to this criticism,
but as a singular work of film an
it is still often remarkable. And
the final scene of Orlandc
speeding through the 20th cen-
tury on a motorcycle with her
daughter strapped snuggly
beside her in the sidecar is
about as memorable as they
come.

With Orlando, Potter has
taken Swinton’s character and
us on far more than just an
excellent adventure, without
forsaking the humor and fantasy
that makes the film compelling
in ways that devout realism can-
not. .

As a running image in the produc-

Macbeth

Directed by Conrad Bishop

Performed by The Independent Eye
Company

It’s always been a timeless theme that
there is enough greed and corruption
in government to fill the Empire State
Building. Over 400 years ago, William
Shakespeare took this theme, expand-
ed on it, threw in some good old witch-
craft and churned out Macbeth, a tale
of political greed and murder in
Scotland.

Lancaster’s Independent Eye reperto-
iy brings this classic to the City Theatre
with all of the necessary doom and
gloom. The main difference between
this production and other productions
of Macbeth is that the Independent Eye
employs puppets and masks instead of
relying on a traditional actor venue.

MACBETH

City Theatre’s physical take
on Shakespeare’s classic play

Even though the puppets are static
and expressionless, the actors do a
good job of using their bodies, relying
on physicality for truly grotesque
poses. The actors almost have to
overemphasize bodily gestures in order

.to compensate for the inanimate faces

of the puppets. However, when the
facial expressions are employed and
we see the actor working through the
puppet, it’s as if we are seeing two
faces responsible for the same set of
lines. This adds to the tension and pas-
sion of the drama and surprisingly

never results in confusion. The compa-
ny seems to want to make a point that
the actors are the ones manipulating
the puppets, not the witches. And it is a
point well taken. In a play where
manipulation and greed spur action, it
would be easy to pass off criminal
behavior and rationalize that the pup-
pets are under the spell of the witches
just as it is easy today to finger rap or
heavy metal music for criminal behav-
ior. The characters have their own
motivations: greed, political power.
prestige, fear and guilt.

tion, the ceremonial smearing of blood
by the witches solidifies Macbeth’s guilt
from the blood on his own hands.
Ceremony is a big part of this produc-
tion. The set is sparse and gothic with a
capital “G.” Heavy velvet, candles and
a pentagram thatched together into
king-like paper dolls form the circle in
which the actors and the puppets
move. The lighting is dark and appro-
priately forboding, throwing long shad-
ows against a black curtain backdrop.

As with Shal<cspeare, it takes a few
minutes into the production to adjust to
the language and sometimes Conrad
Bishop runs his lines way too fast as
Macbeth. Other than that minor gripe,
Bishop, Elizabeth Fuller and Camilla
Schade do a first—rate job of taking a
classic and remaking it into something
fresh, insightful and cutting edge.

By Brian Gallagher
Sports Editor

LATROBE, PA. —- West Penn AAA has
no problem determining the actual dis-
tance between Johnstown, Pa. and a
grassy nearby knoll called Latrobe. The
eternal mileage experts say the two
towns are 41 paved miles apart.

Forgive Alex Van Pelt if he doesn’t
agree with the trip—tick and tow truck
people, at least in a figurative sense.

For the former Pitt star and current
rookie quarterback of the Pittsburgh
Steelers, the gap separating Johnstown
and Latrobe —- the respective training
sites of the Panthers and Steelers -— goes
beyond literal locations and mere mea-
surements. It involves dramatic disparity.

Between stability and uncertainty.

Between stardom and obscurity.

for three or four years -— then all of a
sudden, it’s nothing,” Van Pelt said after
morning workouts Monday. “Right now,
I’m just pretty much keeping my, mouth
shut here.”

As a record-breaking quarterback at
Pitt from 1989- to 1992, Van Pelt spent his
late-summer days training in Johnstown,
where he had the comforrt of knowing
his playing status for his final three sea-
sons —— starting quarterback.

At Latrobe, no such comfort exists.

Van Pelt —— self-proclaimed “fourth-
string” for now -— is for all intents and
purposesbattling Rick Strom for the
Steelers’ number-three position.

Not starter. Not backup. Third-string.

Not exactly a meteoric vault from the
college record books.

For Pitt’s all—time passing yardage
leader, while the adjustment to a backup
role has been “tough,” it doesn’t show.
Van Pelt practiced with the same hum-
ble, cocksure nature that drove him to

Women's track signs three top recruits

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

With the graduation of seven members
of Pitt’s nationally acclaimed women’s
track program, head coach Steve Lewis will
look to three incoming rookies to continue
the standard of excellence set by his recent
graduates.

This year‘s rookie class will be led by
Angela Martin, Jennifer Williams and
Pennsylvania’s own Stephanie Ellsworth.

Martin was one of this year’s most highly
recruited female prep track athletes in the
country and a recent graduate from
Denbigh High School. She is one of two
recruits from Virginia (Williams is the
other) to choose Pitt.

“I chose Pitt because I like the Pittsburgh
environment. The people I met at the uni-
versity were really friendly  they treat
you like a person, not a runner.”

Martin has accomplished many things in

her illustrious high school career. This past
winter slre ranked third in the nation in the
indoor 800 meters. She was also two-time
national champion in the 500.

During the outdoor season, Martin pos-
sessed tremendous range being able to
compete from the 100 to the mile. Her best
event in the outdoors is the 300 intermedi-
atelhurdlers, where Martin ranked 11th in
the country with a time of 43.55 seconds.

Coach Lewis feels Martin is capable of
running anything.

“She will make an impact on our team,”
Lewis said. “This year she will focus on the
500 meters.”

Williams, one of the top hurdlers on the
East Coast, ended her prep career in the
same state as Martin -— graduating from
Maury High in Norfolk, Va. She chose Pitt
over Georgia Tech, Georgetown, William

you feel that you are a part of a big family
once you join the team. Also, I like the
great hurdling tradition at Pitt.

“But most important, Pitt has a great
business school.”

The defending district champion in the
100 hurdles (12.44) the past three years,
Williams feels she can continue where
graduating Pitt All-American Allison
Williams left off.

“I think I can follow her footsteps and
carry it a lot further,” Williams said.

Ellsworth, a local runner from
Waynesburg Pa., will try to fill the vacan-
cies left by Laura O’Donnel, Carmela
Mariani and Judy Facey.

She is looking forward to the intense
competition of collegiate track.

“I think the better the competition is, the
faster I will improve,” Ellsworth said.
“That’s why I decided to go to Pitt. I know
it will be a learning process and I am
ready to learn.”

fozyrzes
reaches into
past for new
A$tAD

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

Last December, the Pitt ath-
letic department reached into
its past when it hired‘ football
coach Johnny Majors.

Two weeks ago, Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes reached
into his own past to find a new
assistant athletic director for
operations and facilities inan-
agement.

Mark Hollis, 30, will take
over that position next month.
Hollis had been working as an
assistant commissioner in the
Western Athletic Conference for
the last six years. Jaynes had
been the AD at Colorado State
(a WAC team) before moving
to Pittsburgh two years ago.

“I worked very closely with
[Jaynes] and probably the single
biggest reason for [me] taking
the [Pitt] job was watching what
Oval did while he was at
Colorado State,” Hollis said.
“He took a program that was
just in the depths of the confer-
ence and in a matter of two or
three years, he turned it into
one of the strongest programs
in our league for basketball,
football  \While he was here
it was the first time in a decade
they went to a bowl game.
They went to the NCAA basket-
ball tournament.

“He had his heart [surgery
last summer] and I know that
was a setback, but I know that
kind of success will come to
Pittsburgh quickly.”

When Pitt began to restruc-
ture its athletic department in
June, Jaynes said one of his pri-
orities was bringing in some-
one to handle games opera-
tions and facilities manage-
ment.

“Every university has had this
position and it is my under-
standing that Pittsburgh has
lacked in this area.,"’ Hollis
said.

A facilities manager becomes
even more important with Pitt
planning its new convocation
center.

“That was one of the other
exciting facets for me  having
the opportunity to get involved
with that,” Hollis said. “I do
have experience working with
architects [with the building of
Michigan State’s facility].

“I have been everything from
a manager to a coach to an
administrator and I think I
know the areas that are impor-
tant to all three of those. I think
those [and sports information]
are the four most important
areas when you are designing a
building. The number one fac-
tor in building a building is
making it friendly to fans.”

Hollis said that he will be

Vasvary hopes new recruits

Relying heavily on a nucleus of young run-
ners, the Pitt men’s track team progressed
nicely during the last few meets of the 1992
outdoor season. If improvement is to contin-
ue in 1993, head coach John Vasvary will
again have to rely on a strong base of new
recruits.

Both hurdlers were timed under 14 seconds

Another talented hurdler is Damon

Williams as a middle distance runner at Pitt.

Problems that he pointed to are
parking, finding a location, the
congestion and one other prob-

lem with the hill.

“I was there Friday and
walked my wife up the hill and
I had to drag her a little bit,”
Hollis said.

In addition to his experience
with the building of facilities,
Hollis has worked with the
scheduling of the WAC’s base-
ball and men’s and women’s
basketball tournaments.

“lWith the tournament] you
are scheduling facilities for
practices all over town and
scheduling a ton of games in
the period of a few days,”
Hollis said. “It’s kind of a con-
centrated effort of what I

would be doing [at Pitt], over a
long period of time.

"It wouldn’t be as intense at
Pitt at any one time, but it
would be more of a day-to—day
type operation.”

WAC Commissioner Dr. Joe
Kearney said his former assis-
tant wanted to work with a sin-
gle university. .

“One of the things he wanted
after an eight—year commitment
with us was to get on a college
campus,” Kearney said.

“It was very important,”
Hollis said. “I was at Michigan
State, with the basketball pro-
gram there. You get into a feel-
ing of family with the university

“Eveiybody’s pretty excited about next year
— how they perform is a different story.

"I don’t want to say any new recruit is a
standout and put the whammy on him,
because there is a lot of adjustment going
from high school to college,” Vasvary said.

“We were very, very young last year  so
our class will add youth to youth.”

have to keep that confidence
level up.” i

Less than a week into his first
pro training camp, Van Pelt is
blunt about his performance as
a Steeler.

“So far, I’ve been a little
rusty,” Van Pelt said. “Some of
the plays [I’m learning] are
starting to run together just a
little bit. I’ve just got to get that
rust off.

No small task considering the
talent he faces ever day. Ever
hear of Rod Woodson? Greg
Lloyd? These guys aren’t exact-
ly the Temple Owls.

For Van Pelt, the biggest dif-
ference between the pro player
and the college player is
speed. Lots of speed.

“In college, you have a lot
more time to make a decision.
If a guy’s open, he’s open by
three or four yards. Here, if

.he’s open, he’s open by a step.

'_l"hat"s all la quarterback] is
going to get.”

Van Pelt avoided waxing
about the auspice of playing
for the team he idolized as a
child. He never thought it was
much of a reality back then.

“I always followed the
Steelers,” Van Pelt said. “In the
Super Bowl years, I was such a
big fan of theirs. As far as
wanting to play pro football,
that never really crossed my
mind until college.”

Van Pelt expressed no bitter-
ness over the way his record-
setting collegiate career ended.
Sure, he’d have liked to leave
Pitt on a winning note, but he’s
not letting it affect his post-col-
lege life.

“Believe me, there’s a lot
more things I have to worry

about now,” Van Pelt said. “So
I try to forget about all that
stuff and just look ahead.

What isn’t past tense in Van
Pelt’s life is his relationship
with former Pitt head coach
Paul Hackett.

Though he hasn’t spoken to
Hackett recently ——- AVP kidded
that he had “his hands full”
with some quarterback named
Montana ——- Van Pelt did speak
with the Kansas City Chiefs’
offensive coordinator in April.

“I talked to him the day
before the draft,” Van Pelt said.
“He told me he’d do whatever
he could to help me out [in the
pros]. ,

While Van Pelt endured a

bulk of criticism during his final
season in Oakland, it hasn’t
affected his strong connection
to the Pitt football program.

“I think they have a good
attitude there [with Coach
Majorsl,” Van Pelt said. “I’m
looking forward to watching
them.

"I’m going to go over [to
Oakland] whenever I can and
support them.”

As for his goal in the coming
year with the Steelers? A roster
spot? Placekick holder?

“I’m just trying to have a
good practice this afternoon,”
Van Pelt said, laughing. “That’s
about it. I’m taking them one at
a time.”
