University Gets
Service Board  
For Deferment

Committee of Deans
Advises on Eligibility
[See editorial, page two]

By 1-"min LANGE'

Establishment of a University
board to handle student selective
service deferment was announced
today along with a list of depart-
ments in which students enrolled
will be “recommended for
most serious consideration” for oc-
cupational deferment.

Provost Rufus H. Fitzgerald re-
vealed that the board of deans, an-
ticipating student deferment sug-
gestions from national selective
service headquarters, formed a com-
mittee at the April 16 meeting to
inform draft boards of deferment‘
eligibility of faculty and students.

Occupational Deferment

Students enrolled in the follow-
ing courses are recommended to
be given “most serious considera-
tion . . . to the individual occupa-
tional deferment . . as necessary
men in activities necessary for na-
tional defense,” according to a let-
ter circulated to the selective serv-
ice state directors from national
headquarters: _

Chemistry; engineering: civil,
electrical, chemical, mining, metal-
lurgical, ‘mechanical, agricultural,
sanitary; dentistry; pharmacy;
physics; medicine; biology: bac-
teriology; and geology: geo-phys-
ics, meteorology, hydrology. and
cartography.

The “consideration” is to given
because of a probable shortage of
trained men in these ﬁelds, accord-
ing to the letter reprinted in the
bulletin on higher education and
national defense of the American
Council on Education from which
the information is taken. The bul-
Ietin was‘ received by Fitzgerald
Monday.

Individual, Not Group

Since the provision is not a group
deferment, each case will be dealt
with individually.

‘Students enrolled in the schools
which have been given “considera-
tion” should ﬁrst consult the dean
of their school and he will inform
the University board if he consid-
ers the case valid for deferment.

The University board will inform
the respective draft board of the

The Pitt News
Wins Highest
A CP .4 ward

Journalistic laurels came to the
Pitt News on Monday when the
Associated’ Collegiate press and the
National Scholastic Press associa-
tion annour1ced',All-American hon-
ors for the student tri-weekly.

The award, given for the ﬁrst

semester of the present year, marks

the first time the Pitt News has
reached that rating which is the
highest ranking honor. Six other
collegiate papers in the same classi-
ﬁcation, of two or three times
weekly with a circulation of 2,500
plus, received the All-American
award.

In 1938, 1939, 1940 the News was
ranked ﬁrst class, one step below
the present ranking.

Typographic excellence, “profes-
sionally madeup pages, usually
mature and pertinent editorial ma-_
terial, good sports coverage,” en-
abled the News to secure 880
points. All-American honors were
given to the -seven publications in
-the same class scoring between a,
high 925 points to a low of 825.

Complete ratings and their sig-
niﬁcances are All-American, su-
perior; First class, excellent; Sec-
ond class, good; Third class, fair;
and Fourth class, no honors. ‘

Commenting on the new journal-
istic honor, Rugy Aldisert, C41, Pitt
News editor, said: ' 2 '

“I am thrilled‘ to hear this an-
nouncement because it gives some
recognition to the; 75 2'“ men and
women. students responsible for
turning out the Pitt News three
times a week.

“Although. every staff member
has cont-ributed"t:oward* this honor,
a great deal of the credit should go
to Irv Kaufman, our managing
editor; Seymour Kerber, our copy
editor; and Bill McElwain, sports
editor, for their unselﬁsh endeavor
in supervising work on the paper
and the training of underclassmen.”

[Statements of the platforms and ideals of the campus political
parties were made by Fred Robie, Ed41, Indnependtent head and Alvin
Ludwig, BA41, Fraternity spokesman] ' ‘

FRED ROBIE

There is-only one issue in this
election: whether . student govern-
ment is to be run by_ a working or
shirking majority. The present fra-
ternity majority has said. “Vote for
good men!” for the past three years.
In these three years, these “good
men” have proposed nothing of con-
sequence for the average student.
' Independent candidates stand for
things the average student hopes
to gain—-surveys for cheaper books,
cheaper housing, cheaper transpor-

tation, and an engineers’ recreation

program.

Fraternities claim to support the
sameiaims, but not only have they
done nothing, but also the Inde-
pendents who initiated the program
deserve the majority to carry it out.
Because of our complicated elec-
tion set-up, the only way to obtain
that majority is to vote slate.

Independent slates are clearly
marked, “Independent.” We must
not be mislead by unmarked slates.

ALVIN LUDWIG
Today we face the opposite party
on the one big (and only) issue of
the campaign: which candidates are
the best. On this ground alone do

we differ, for we all know that once .

the election is over, the promises, if
any, go with the wind, and the suc-
cessful candidates, regardless of
party affiliation, sit side by side and
work within University—set limita-
tions to a common end. The results

‘of their work, of course, depend not
-‘on their party affiliation, but on

their individual abilities. For this
reason both parties are placing
emphasis upon quality and accord-
nigly we see that this year the can-

didates are, almost without excep- ,

tion, able people’.

The important thing is that we go
out and vote for the best man and
don’t become too excited over the
fact that there are two parties
running candidates. As parties we
differ only in so far as we run dif-
ferent people for office. ~

Health Services, Pitt News Launch
Anti-Tuberculosis Drive Next Week

Encouraged by the tremendous
student response to the anti—syphil-

most 1,300 students were blood test-
ed, the Men and Women’s Health
:service:.=,, in cooperation with the
Pitt News, will launch a two-week

Natiorvail Kappa Sigma ﬂffice
Revokes Pitt Chapter Charter

Kappa Sigma fraternity, which
had its charter revoked recently by
its national office, will close the
local chapter house at 272 North
Dithridge street tomorrow pending
application to the University for
permission to operate as a local fra-
ternity.

Richard Sonnenfeld, C41, presi-
dent of the local chapter, offered the
following explanation to the student
body concerning the action by the
national fraternity:

“The active brothers of Kappa
Sigma wish at this time to inform
all students of the University that
the national fraternity of Kappa
Sigma, feeling it is impossible be-
cause of peculiar local conditions to
sustain a strong chapter at this
University, has seen ﬁt to withdraw
the national status of this chapter.”

6 Speech Finalists

To Compete Today

Six students, remainder of a ﬁeld
of 20 after last Friday’s elimina-
tions, will compete in the ﬁnals of
the annual speech contest this aft-
ernoon at 3:30 o'clock in 251 Ca-
thedral.

Speaking in today’s ﬁnals are:
Harold Bleakley. C42; Irwin Rosen,
C43; Eleanor Thomas, C43; Dave
Tucker, C41; David Zaccharias,
C42; and Gerald Ziskind, C41.

At the ﬁnals this afternoon the
six winning speeches will be re-
peated, but a different set of judges
than those who officiated at the
eliminations will award the first
and second place prizes of $10 and
$5. Judges in the contest will be
Dr. Stanton C. Crawford. dean of
the College; Dr. John J. Geise, as-
sociate professor of history; and
George Yost, instructor in English.

In order to operate with Univer-
sity sanction as a local fraternity,
the group will have to receive per-
mission from the Men’s Fraternity
committee, oflicial faculty supervi-
sory board over fraternities.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men and chairman of the board,
stated Monday that the application
for local status had not yet been
made by officers or members of
Kappa Sigma. Members of the
Mens Fraternity committee will
meet to Consider such a petition
when and if it is presented, Dr.
Lanfear declared. The committee
is composed of faculty representa-
tives from each school of the Uni-
versity.

campaign on tuberculosis, begin-
ning next Monday.

Described by campus health lead-
ers, Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of
the Men’s Student Health service,
and Dr. Auleene Marley Jamison,
director of the Women’s Student
Health service, as being equally as
important as the Wassermann tests,
the campaign is a part of the gen-
eral health program of the Uni-
versity.

According to Dr. Carlson the
Wassermann tests were conducted
first because the procedure for
them is much more difficult than
the tuberculosis determining tests.
It takes a relatively longer time
though to establish the immediate
results of the tuberculin tests. Also
it is pointed out by Dr. Jamison
that positive test, indicating the
presence of the tuberculosis germ,
is a good sign in most cases.

If a positive reaction is shown
after the ﬁrst test is taken, either
the patient has tuberculosis or he
had the germ in his system and
withstood it. In either case a pos-
itive case is referred to Falk clinic
for a chest x-ray.

If the result of the test is nega-

tive the individual is in danger of
contracting the disease, and the test
should be taken at least annually.
It was further pointed out by both
directors that the danger of con-
tracting tuberculosis or harboring
the tube *culosis germ is exception-
ally high in the age group of col-
lege students. However tuberculo-
sis is a curable disease.

The test in itself is very simple.
A drop of the tuberculosis detect-
ing serum is injected into the arm,
and if in 48 hours no detecable spot
appears, a stronger test is given a
week later. If, however, a spot
forms around the place of injection,
the individual is referred to the
Falk clinic for the x-ray examina-
tion.

Because of the nature of the tests
which necessitate a waiting period,
the schedule for taking the tests is
irregular. The Women’s Health
service on the twenty-eighth ﬂoor
will be open for the tests on Mon-
days, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
The Men’s Health service on the
thirty-fourth floor will be open for
the tests on Mondays, ‘Tuesdays,
and«Wednesdays of the weeks be-
ginning May 5 and May 12.

Student Unions Depend on End.owment Funds,
Dues Rather Than on Universities for Support

[Editor’s Note: Following is the
second of a series of articles on stu-
dent unions by staff writer Fred
Lange. Subsequent articles will ex-
plain. the purpose of student unions;
and if, how, when Pitt will have a
student union]

Financially, student union build-
ings are not assets to most univer-
sities.

During a discussion in the Asso-
ciation of College Unions conven-
tion last December the question
arose, “How many unions are self-
supporting?”

“Only a few hands were raised
in response to this question,” re-
ported the bulletin of the ACU to
which 65 college unions belong.

Monetary assistance does not al-
ways come from the University.
Many unions have an endowment
fund which balances the budget. In
fact, only a few universities pro-

vide the heat, light, and power for
their union building.

Although most student unions
are not self-supporting, the uni-
versities do not give ﬁnancial aid
to the union. According to a sur-
vey of the ACU, 14 of 21 unions
questioned reported that no ﬁnan-
cial support was given by the uni-
versity. The report did not state
where funds in addition to the self-
producing revenue came from, but
it is supposed that endowments and
gifts aided.

Probably the most consistent
source of revenue, although not al-
ways the largest source, is the stu-
dent dues, paid year-y, by semester,
or even quarterly, according to the
ﬁnancial program of the union.

Student dues vary from 25 cents
per year in Vermont to $10 a year
at California and Harvard. The
average is about $6 a year, usually
payable by semester.

l\'IOSi of the dues entitle the stu-
dent to the use of the facilities in
the building with usually an extra
charge for use of the gymnasium.
The arrangement depends upon the
facilities of the union building and
varies from one school to the other.

Another source of income for the
student union is the facilities with-
in the building itself.

Cigar, candy, magazine, and
newspaper counters produce a rev-
enue which is an impor.ant factor
in the income of the building, ac-
cording to an article written by P.
B. Hartenstein, director of Huston
hall at the University of Pennsyl-
vania, the oldest union in the coun-
try, and published in the “Amer-
ican School and University.”

Rental from ballrooms used for
all university. class. club, and ira-
ternity dances should provide a
moderate income, writes Harten-

Political activity this year has not been as vigorous as in past years.
No spectacular p0l1thCal_ moves have come about in the past few months,

and so it is expected that ro record number of voters will be set today. '
Last year the total was 1641, far under the all-time record of 1900 set

The Draft Se-it-up
Is Clarified

During the past several weeks the Pitt News
has been stressing the fact that American col-
lege students should be more fully informed
as to how they stand with the draft.‘ _

A partial reply to our query came yesterday
in a letter from Lewis B. Hershey. deputy di-
rector. ‘which was made public by Provost Fitz-
gerald.‘ ‘ , . ._ e -

Because" we think director Hershey’s letter ‘is
important, we_ print in full the following:

“From studies which I have asked the Bureau of
Labor Statistics to make, I conclude that the supply
of manpower in the specialized professional ﬁelds
listed below, which have a deﬁnite and direct rela-
tionship to the national defense program, is at a dan-
gerously low level. It is necessary that this level be
raised by every means within our power. Certainly
the ﬁow;of trained graduates into these ﬁelds should

not be unnecessarily interrupted by the action of ‘airy "

agency of government. It is ‘my conclusion that the
national interest requires that students be encouraged
to continue their education in these ﬁelds and that
the principle of occupational deferment under the
Selective Service program may be used to assure their
future availability to all activities relating directly or
indirectly to the national defense program.

“The Bureau of Labor Statistics has beeii_repre-
sented at various conferences in discussing this gen-
eral problem and has,.on its own initiative,‘ inter-
viewed responsible people important in the special

i branches of the professions, with a view to getting a

cross section of opinion on the matter. It is_reported
that the uncertainties arising from the attitudes of
local draft boards have already affected the registra-
tion of students for graduate work in the professional
ﬁelds. Therefore, it is urgently recommended that
the most serious consideration be given by the. Se-
lective Service system to the individual occupational
deferment of students in the following courses, sollong
as theyi contin‘ue"‘to‘ be in preparation ‘or training as
necessary men in activities necessary to the national
defense:

Chemistry Engineering
Civil <
Electrical Mining and Metallurgical
Chemical Mechai: ical

“=~'I‘he above occupations have been especially studied
by the bureau and a dangerously low level of man-
power is found to exist therein. Therefore. the imme-
diate attention of Selective Service is requested to the
problem preventing any unnecessary increase of these
shortages so that the national defense program will
not be impeded unnecessarily.

“The following are professional occupations in
which authorities allege that a shortage will exist,

but which have not yet been studied by the bureau. 1

However, there -is cofnplete: agi'eernent’ among irrepre-
sentatives of industry, of American colleges and iini:
versities, and of the practicing professional groups that

the present and future demands of the national de— .

fense program for college-trained scientiﬁc personnel.
will transcend the normal supply of graduating stu-
dents that comes onto the labor market at the close
of the academic year.

, Engineering Biology and Bacteriology
Agricultural Geology

, Sanitary Geo—Physics

Dentistry Meterology

‘Pharmacy Hydrology

.-Physics Cartography

-lV[edlCll’T€‘

“The result of further research, as it becomes avail-
able", will be transmitted to you as a supplement to
this present report.”

“It is directed that this release be disseminated to
all local Selective Service agencies in your state as
an expression of the national policy in these ﬁelds.

“In applying these broad provisions there mus.t_be
no deviation from the clear statutory prohibition
against group deferments. The local board has full
authority and responsibility, subject to appeal, for de-
ciding whether or not a registrant is a necessary man
and whether he should be selected or deferred. It
must consider all the evidence submitted in connec-
tion with each individual case and must decide each
case on its particular facts.

“Part II: ~Prwo_cedure_ on Studeiit Deferments

“Local boards should approach the immediate prob-
lem of reclassiﬁcation of those students whose order
numbers have been passed over because of the tem-
porary student, deferment provided for in paragraph
345 of the regulations and the problem of original
classiﬁcation of those students who "are now receiving
their questionnaires, with due regard to the national
policy as expressed in Part I. /

“In order to assist local boards in applying the
bread. provisions of the above policy and general find-
ings of fact to individual cases, a suggested procedure
for presenting detailed facts to local boards having
jurisdiction. of cases of individual students has been
prepared by the American Council on Education and
concurred in by national headquarters of the Selective
Service system. .

f‘This procedure is set out in detail in the American
Council on Education’s Bulletin No. 10, Sl.lfﬁC.l€I_1tQ0p1eS
of which are being forwarded to your headquarters
un.der separate cover to allow for a distribution of one
per local board. In brief this procedure provides for
getting into the hands of the local board a “Student
Statement of Information” presenting the student’s
statement of his status and plans, and an “Affidavit of
the College or University” in which the college offi-
cials testify as to the student’s standing, courses’ and
occupational objectives, together with a general evalu-
ation of the student as a “necessary man.” This in-
formation should be considered by the local board in
the=sa—mel manner as a Form 42 in other occupational
deferment cases.

“It is requested that state directors cooperate with
colleges and universities in their respective states so
that uniformity of operation may be attained. Simi-
larity of procedure will be of mutual advantage.

LEWIS B. HERSHEY,
Deputy Director.”

The American Council on Education further states:
“Medical Students

“Students who receive their medical degrees this
June may apply for commissions in the Medical re-
serve. The Adjutant General has given positive as-
surance that men who are given reserve commissions
in the Medical corps will not be called to duty during
their initial year of internship. When called into
active duty at the end of one year’s internship they
will receive base—pay ($166.67 a month) and allow-
ances of the rank of ﬁrst lieutenant.

“Factors Affecting Attitude of College Students

“The attitude of students is today affected by sev-
eral factors: employment opportunities, volunteering
for service, and selective service. Calm judgment in
keeping a sane balance between meeting immediate
defense needs and maintaining long-range defense
values is imperative. It should characterize university
administration and be iinparted to the student body.”

"We think the above letter is, in the main. an
adequate answer to the college man’s queries.
VVe think the decision of the draft board is a
good one. Although college students should not
receive special favors, they sﬂould be exempted
when the nature of their studies will in the near
future beneﬁt the defense program.

But we must sigh and “carry rn” as we English
say. And I must tell vnu how dear Fm.-:‘~*nd is holding

up. She is truly holding up, for England’s never will
be slaves. Never.

My last week in England was spent at the country
house of Lady Brown. an old friend of my wife. That
was not a gay week at Edenhaven. The women were
lea;ning to knit and the men were in London dousing
incendiary bombs. .

Each day when it was time for‘ tea and scones-—oh,
how I miss those scones. You Americans simply do
not know how to make them, y’know-——Lady Brown
would rise with a tear lurking in her ﬁne eyes. and
excuse herself to the kitchen. There she would pre-
pare tea with her own hands. Think of it! With her
own hands. Needless to say, I was quite surprised
when I found out, for, I do not know if you American
people are aware of it, England’s better class never
prepares its own tea. But Lady Brown would always
return, smiling bravely, and explain to me how the
menservantswere with Wavell and the womenservantjs
were knitting like mad in London in those bombproof
shelters. .

After tea, Lady Brown and I would walk in the
garden where the neglected roses would never fail to
b;ing another tear to her eyes. She loved them so
much. It only-took half an eye to see'*‘that’;'"“ Then she
would tell me how much she wanted to get down on
her own knees and prune them tenderly (she has no
children). “But, convention is convention,” she would
say, “and my neighbors are such gossips.”

We would talk and speculate concerning how much
longer Hitler would be able to hold out. “It is so try-
ing,.” she would sigh, “to have to put up with that-that»

. German!"

The c=rinvers'i.tion would never fail to turn to Lord
Brown, her husband, who was also with Wavell. She
was ccnsta.ntly_ beset with a tender wrvrrv that those
African sands would so bring on that frightful asthma
of his. But she always took consolation in the thought
that Lord Brown had taken Beaverbrook’s advice to
see that quite a bit of money‘ should be tied up in

. Canada before the war set in.

A That grand and brave lady cameup to Londonito
see me off, and when I‘proteste_d,'she lauglriingly said
she had to help the Queen with her knitting anyway.
They are really jolly good friends, y’know.

I must close now, for my publishers insist that I
do not do too much “free writing,” as they say. It’s
bad for the old exchequer, y’know. But I cannot resist
showing you Americans how brave we English can be
with it all-. And please do not think we are envious of
your security. We would gladly prepare our own tea,
as it were, rather than let that beast of a Hitler defy
us on the Poland question.

Next week I will show just how the recent Britisli
evacuation from Greece may be construed as a bill-
liant strategic move,

Panther ‘cinder squadsince 1937,
and despite their abundance of ma-
terial, the Blue and White will be
the under-dog again.

Key man for the Lions is. of
course. Norwood (Barney) Ewell,
national intercollegiate 100-yard
and 200-yard dash champion. John
Glenn. high jumper from Norris-
town. also performs very satisfac-
torily for the Penn State team.

From the competitive standpoint,
the feature race of the meet will be
the renewal of the Carter-Ewell-
Stickel sprint feud. Bullet Bill and
Handsome Hap both triumphed over
the Lion ace indoors on different
occasions. In the ntunber one out-
door duel last week-end at Phila-
delphia, Stickel was out with an
injured leg.

Stickel’s presence among the Pitt
entry this weekend is still problem-
atical. but his injured leg seems to
be responding to treatment, and
may be ready Saturday. The teams
other cripple, Larry Ttﬁgoning, still
hasn't got his strength back, but his
running Saturday will be good
preparation for the Indiana meet,
May 10.

Amongthep annual features at the
Penn Relays last Friday and Satur-
day was the mediocrity of the pole
vault competition. None of the
competitors could clear 13 feet six
inches; consequently the bar was
lowered to 13 feet three inches, and
John Dick of Pennsylvania won
the match at that height. Doyle
Rhoades and Red Jessup went to 13
feet, but Jessup had a sprained
ankle and Rhoades spiked himself
on his ﬁrst jump.

FRIDAY, MAY 2

An improved group of Panther
netmen will be trying to break .1
two game losing streak ~_ against
either Slippery Rock today or Grove
City tomorrow, meeting both at
Trees ﬁeld. ' ’

Although the lineup for doubles
competition might be changed, the
regular group of racket wielclers
will play the single matches. These
include in order of play, captain Ed
Goehring, Frank Harmuth, Dick
Trimble, Frank Gaenger, Henry
Grance and Bob Nickeson. How-
ever, Bob Jordon, Jack Wynn and
Bill Reese are putting up quite a
battle for the two lower slots.

Both Ohio State and Penn State
have won decisions over the Panth-
ers,..while Slippery Rock decisive-
ly defeated Clarion Teacher, 9-_0.
Grove City's aggregation topped by
McClosky and Hutton, is almost
the same one that faced the 1940
Panther squad.

1941 Home Season

Pitt‘s...varsity golfers open: their
home season this afternoon with a
match against Slippery Rock at the
Alcoma Country club.

Captain Bill Kramer and sopho-
more Ed Simpson, only singles win-
ners in last Saturday’s Army match,
carry the chief hopes of Coach Art
Underwood’s squad.

Other probable point-seekers for
Pitt are Bob Seybold, Jim Butcher,
Jack Glenn, and Bob Jones.

match.

Race by Topping P111 Ixap Sluggers

With visions of a championship title spurring them on, the Phi Eps
will battle PiKA in tomorrow’s highlight game.

Opposing the Phi Eps’ ace twirler, Jay Silverberg, will be no-hit
Backing up Silverberg, will be a star studded in-
field Led by slugging Wally Hirsch, and a hard hitting outfield of Coplin,

artist Fred Davis.

Gould. and Deutlebaum.

Equal in strength is the PiKA
inﬁeld made up of Ralph Wilde,
Dick Fair, and John Syka, while
their outﬁeld composed of Carlson,
Anderson, and Gus Wilde is one of
the best in the league.

With the loss of pitcher Lou
Mendlow by graduation putting
them in the role of under—dog, the
Sammies, defending champions,
will tackle the Phi Kaps in another
headliner.

The Sammies will have to de-
pend solely on the efforts of “Red”
Silverman in the pitching depar-t-
ment and Hack White for driving in
the runs, while the Phi Kaps will
have their best pitcher, Mike So-
tack on the mound, backed by the
slugging of Tyberski and Dax.

With Sigma Chi still very much
in the championship running, their
game, with Lambda Chi Alpha also
looms as a top-notcher.

Although Lambda Chi Alpha has
not shown much this year, their
murderers’ row of Parke, Rose, and
Shiﬂer can easily spring an upset.

In another interesting game, it
will be the pitching of Marty Fa-
berman against the bat of Walt
West in the Pilams-SAE game.

Faberman has always been back-
ed ably by burly Hilliard Kreimer
in the batting ‘box and by Lenny
Wolk in the infield, but other than
that he has had little support either
in the field or at bat.

Phi Kappa Routs Phi Eps, 10-2,

Behind Sotack’s

Rain, forfeits, studies, and what
have you played havoc with intra-
mural athletics last week. "How-
ever, most of the games that were
played were better than average.

What was supposed to be the
best game of the day turned into
a rout last Thursday when the Phi
Kaps slaughtered the Phi Eps, 10-2.
The highly touted Neville street
sluggers were helpless against the
pitching of Mike Sotack, Phi Kap
ace. ‘

Flashing a pitching ‘orm com-
parable to that of his all-intramu-
ral predecessor, Lew Mendlow, Red
Silverman led the SAM nine to an
easy win over the Phi Delts, 12-0.
Silverman allowed only two hits
and struck out 1-1 opponents. The
winners played with only seven
men, but needed only two, Silver-
man and his able receiver, Harry
Abromovitz.

Led by Johnny Bitner, the Phi
Garns easily won from Theta Chi
14-3. Bitner hit two home runs to
pace his mates, and McCoy hit one
for the losers.

In a slugging exhibition, the
Delts ﬁnally beat the 1SAES, 12-11.
Newbury, Delt outﬁelder, hit for
the circuit-‘as did McCullough and
Stormer of the SAES.

Irwin “Hank” Greenberg, lanky
star of the Pilams, hit two homers
while his mates clubbed Sigma Chi
pitching with ease to win 13-3.

With Steve Zernich pitching shut-

out ball, APD breezed -to a win
over the disappointing Gamma
Gamma Woos, 15-0, while in other
Independent contest, the Cardinals,
led by the hitting of Jameson and
the pitching of Gleeson, beat the
Amity Club 12-5.

On Friday the Bus Ads shaded
APD, 3-1, with Bob Schmeltz hurl-
ing for the winners. Despite a
physical handicap, Schmeltz was
able to handcuff the APD hitters
with ease.

In the Engineering league, the
AE&ME seniors defeated the
Oil&Gas nine, 7-4, to close the day’s
mushball activities.

Page and Armagost, PiKA actives,
led their house to an easy win over
the Pilams in horseshoes, 5-1.

Norvo ‘V ill Play
At Sports Dance

As tickets for the Sport’s dance,
concluding event of Festival week,
went on sale today, it was announc-
ed that Red Norvo, leader of’the
swing band, will play for the affair.

Formerly with Paul Whiteman,
with a reputation as the world's
greatest zylophonist, Norvo gained
fame as a bandleader in the Satur-
day Night sessions. Paired with

-Mildred Bailey, he became known

as-the Mr.l’ot' the “Mr. and.Mrs. of
Swing.” "When Norvo brings his
Band to next Friday's all Univer-
sity sponsored ﬁnale, it will be the
first time he and his fourteen men
have appeared on campus. He will
come to Pitt from the Port Stanley
Pavilion, Ontario, Canada.

According to chairman Dick
Frankovich, C41, tickets for the
Finale are $2 and may be obtained
from committee members from to-
day until Friday, May 9.

University Wins ’
Speech Awards

In Peace Contest

A three-way win was scored by
the University at the annual Peace
Oratorical contest, which took place
on Friday at Bucknell university.

First prize of $50 went to Sam
Rodgers, C41, who won the state-
wide competition with his speech
“Legion and I,” the same one which
carried him through the elimination
contest held at the University last
February.

In his speech, Rodgers told his
audience that war is to be more
desired than the prospect of a world
living under a Nazi victory. The
oration took the form of a fantasy
conversation, in which Rodgers im-
agined himself speaking to the hosts
of college students throughout
America, whom he called “My
Friend Legion.”

Second major victory to come to
the University in the contest was
the naming of Roy H. Umble, in-
structor in speech, as state chair-
man for next year’s contest. Umble
has been connected with the contest
for the past three years, acting as
a member of the committee spon-
soring the event. ‘ I

The ﬁnal Pitt triumph was the
selection of the University campus
as the scene ofnext year’s contest.

Continued from page one
facts concerning the student’s eligi-
bility for deferment.

.D_eans E. A. Gilmore, E. A. Hol-
brook, and Stanton C. Crawford
are members of the University
board. More members will be add-
ed to include representatives from
all departments listed in deferment
“considerations,” according to Dean
Gilmore, chairman of the board.

The following statement was re-
leased from Fitzgerald's office:

“In anticipation of the procedure
outlined above (referring to tech-
nical recommendations in the ACE
bulletin), the board of deans at its
meeting April 16 authorized con-
tinuance of the present University
committee consisting of Deans Gil-
more, Crawford, and Holbrook to
serve as a central board to handle
all questions of faculty and student
deferment,» and to lay before appro-
priate draft boards all pertinent
facts concerning prospective draft-
ees and eligibility for deferment in
accordance with the principles
above set forth.

“Membership in the present com-
mittee will be increased to repre-
sent all areas concerned. In order
to insure uniformity of operation in
the application of regulations gov-
erning student deferment, it is the
desire of the University administra-
tion that all students who think
they might be eligible for defer-
ment under the above principles
(ACE bulletin) should take the
matter up first with the dean of the
college in which they: are register-
ed‘ who will investigate the case
and report thereon the facts and
his recommendation to the central
University board.”

Student Unions

Continued from page one
stein, and cafeterias are found in
almost all student unions to be an
excellent revenue agent.

Private dining rooms, widely
used by faculty and undergrad-
uate groups on special occasions,
are moderately proﬁtable, director
Hartenstein maintains. Dining rooms
with waiter or waitress service
usually provide only a small rev-
enue. ’ “

Billiard rooms and game rooms
are usually very proﬁtable, accord-
ing to Hartenstein, who writes,
“While they require a great deal
of attention and supervision, they
are recreational features which are
revenue-producers and in every in-
stance popular.”

Barber shops and theaters in
unions are not particularly proﬁt-
able, but bookstores, soda foun-
tains and bowling alleys are usually
proﬁtable enterprises, Hartenstein
claims.

Guests rooms, usually found in
student unions in colleges located
in small towns, are extremely
proﬁtable, the director of Huston
hall asserts.

All unions do not have all the
facilities which are mentioned -by
Hartenstein and each union has its
own ﬁnancial problems to face,
problems which vary as do the
buildings, facilities, and the size
and situation of the school at which
the building is constructed.

(Friday—Two big unions, one
worthy of a Time write-up, the
other with a taproom.)
