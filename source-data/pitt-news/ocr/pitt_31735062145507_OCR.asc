University To Be Nucleus
1 For YMCA District Plan

 

--:1

The University will have a key ‘po-
sition in the new plan for organiza-
tion of geographical areas within the
Middle Atlantic Field council of the
YM-YWCA as the result of a new
plan adopted at the council’s joint
meeting October 21 at West Ches-
ter State Teachers’ college near
Philadelphia, reported King Derr,
C35, Pitt YMCA representative there.

Pitt YMCA will be the integrating
unit for a district comprising western
Pennsylvania and the panhandle of
West Virginia. With this new posi-
tion they will be responsible for ‘or-
ganizing a district committee. King
Derr, C35, is the chairman of the
council. Miss Battrick, executive sec-
retary of the YWCA, was the woman
representative from Pitt.

The Council adopted a program for
joint action on projects within the re-
gion which are of mutual interest to
men and women students.

Early in March an intercollegiate
student conference for men an
women will be planned by the YMCA
district committee, yet to be appoint-
ed, and the present area committee of
the YWCA.

Welfare, YM-YWCA

 

Approximately 150 men and women
students will participate in the
Student Chest drive which will start
on the campus Monday, November 13,
John B. Holbrook, E34, president of
the YMCA, announced yesterday.
Scheduled to start with a luncheon
in Heinz House that day, the drive
will solicit every student on the cam-
pus to obtain funds for Student Loan,
Pitt-in-China, the Welfare Fund and
the University YM and YWCA.

Student Council approved the plans
for the drive, Holbrook announced,
and plans for the ﬁnal organization
are advancing under the leadership
of Homer Wadsworth, E35, student
chairman, and W. W, Mendenhall,
general faculty chairman.

Eliminating the Student Loan and
Pitt-in-China tag days, which take
place annually on the campus, the

vember campaign among the several
organizations assisting in the drive.

The campaign will be handled

Student Relations
Will Direct Drive

Committee To Hear Investigating
Group Report This Week

 

At last Thursday's meeting of stu-
dent relations committee, Ray Mc-
Cune, E34, chairman, announced that
the student relations group will su-
pervise the Welfare Fund drive on
the campus.

By Friday of this week, it is re-
ported, news will be forthcoming from
the investigations committee of stu-
dent relations. The probing commit-
tee, which is also directed by Mc-
Cune, has for the past two weeks

pus activities to determine the func-
tions and limits of student activities.

Thus far representatives of the John
Marshall club, honorary pre-legal
fraternity, and Druids, sophomore
men’s honorary, have conferred with
McCune’s group. As McCune declared
at student relations meeting last
week, however, “There has been no
reporter at our meetings and when
we report we shall report duly through
student relations, to whom we are re-
sponsible.”

partment, and director of the Gulf Re-
search corporation addressed the oil
and gas seminar Thursday on “Recent
Research in the Petroleum Industry.”

Problems met in testing oil well
equipment and in improving geophy-
sical prospecting methods were dis-
cussed by Dr. Foote. He explained
and illustrated by slides a new ma-
chine that has been developed in his
department, to take the place of 300
men in calculating results secured
from geophysical prospecting. The
experimental oil well drilled and

d equipped with various improved types

of pumping machinery, now situated
on the Boulevard of the Allies, near

conference offers an excellent oppor-
tunity for students in political science

All-Student Show

Group Meeting Last Thursday
Features Long-Sought Idea

As a result of the ﬁrst Cap and
Gown meeting of the year in the
Schenley hotel last Thursday evening,
hopes for a. student-written show in
April have risen appreciably.

Members of the production com-
mittee, it is reported, approved the
idea of an all-student musicale. Stu-
dents who attended last week and
others who have ideas on possible
"Cap and Gown themes are invited to
attend. The next meeting is sched-
uled for November 9.

Bernard Rosenson, BA34; Norman
Wolken, C34; Ross Colvin, C36; Stan-
ley Goldman, C35; Everett Pickering,
BA35, and Joseph Letteriello, C36,
were present at Thursday’s get-to-
gether. Pickering brought along two
books he had written and others pre-
sented their still incomplete plans.

Rosenson declared yesterday, “Our
biggest trouble in the past has been
lack of good, snappy dialogue, If we
can perfect our lines so that we don’t:
have to use the old, hackneyed, “I!
love you, dearest one,” too often,
our chances of success are much
greater.

Debate Forum Will Meet

For Zionism Discussion

 

On the assumption that college stu-
dents need greater opportunity to ex-
press themselves, the student council
of the YM-WHA is organizing a stu-
dent debate forum. The organization
meeting will take place tomorrow
evening at 8 o’clock in the YM-WHA
building under the chairmanship of
Joseph Swartz, BA34.

To start proceedings, Louis Shub,
C34, will speak on “The Student and
Zionism.” After the talk, the meet-
ing will be thrown open for discussion
on topics of interest. Experienced
coaches will help, and audiences will
be found for the debaters. All stu-
dents interested are invited to attend
the meeting.

the Tennessee valley and other Fed-
eral power projects. Local problems

to utility companies elsewhere,

Joseph P. Tufts, assistant director
of the Pittsburgh Housing association
and adviser to the commission on
housing and slum clearance, will talk
on private, public and co-operative ef-
forts toward better housing.

The view of Dr. J. P. Watson, as-
sistant director of the Bureau of
Business Research, toward taxation
and tax units and municipal govern.
ment ﬁnance is that the existing or-
ganization of local governments does
not ﬁt the community. He will form
his discussion around this point, show-
ing that out of this misﬁt arises the
demand for a metropolitan govern-
ment, under which the numerous com-
peting and conﬂicting taxing units
would be coordinated.

Municipal Issues, sponsored by the
YM and YWCA, with a discussion on
“What Are the Issues?” at 12:30
o’clock this afternoon.

Mr. Garland’s talk will be an in-
formal discussion on the present mu-
nicipal issues and good citizenship.
Mr. Garland stated: “My discussion
will be directed by students’ questions
rather than by any formal outline.
It is my opinion that only by this

day will be centered around four com-
mission meetings that will occur con-
currently between 3:30 and 5:30
o’clock in the YM and YWHA build-
ing on Belleﬁeld avenue.

These meetings will offer an op-
portunity to the students to investi-
gate under able leadership one of
the following acute issues facing the
citizens of Pittsburgh: (1) Public
utilities, under the leadership of Dr.
George K. McCabe, of the economics
department, (2) Judiciary reforms,
with Gustav L. Schramm, assistant
professor of political science. (3) Tax-

On Friday at the same time and
place, William N. McNair, Democratic
candidate for mayor, will speak on

if city government were run accord-

many of our present municipal issues
such as housing and extreme poverty
would be practically non-existent. Mr.
McNair will be introduced to the con-
ference by Dr, Mccabe.

Alumni Association Furthers Campaign For Passage Of Amendment 8

Giants Or Pigmies,
When They Weigh
9169 Pounds

Prior to the Minnesota gaII_1e.
the Chicago papers came out with
headlines about the “Pitt Giants.”
Other papers have been referring to
the Panthers as somewhat smallish
boys. In order to clear up this point
for people who might be interested,
the following ﬁgures have been com-
piled, with the help of an adding
machine and a certain circulation
manager, Charles Januska.

When the Pitt footballers trot
around on the practice ﬁeld, they
are putting said ﬁeld to no mean
strain. When all the boys gather in
one spot around Coach Jock Suther-
land that spot is subject to the
weight of 9,169 pounds, or an amount
just slightly under that which your
driveway bears when the coal truck
pulls up with ﬁve tons of bituminous.

Should the boys decide to take
their lectures standing up, that is,
one on top of the other, the fellow
at the top would be listening in to
the discussion from a height of 305%
feet. If this human stack should
move down to the Cathedral the top
man could look in on about the
twenty-eighth ﬂoor and probably
wouldn't see much.

Getting these calculations down to
somewhat more practical terms, we
find that the average Pitt football
player is a gentleman ﬁve feet ten
and one-half inches tall, and his penny
in the proper slot of a scale will send
the arrow wavering to the 176.3
pound mark. Which may, or may
not, prove something, or anything.

Forensic Group Picks Five Men;
Continues Tryout Discussions

 

Five new members were accepted

into the Men’s Debating association‘

as the result of extended tryouts
which took place Thursday afternoon.

Hubert Teitelbaum, C37, James
Boyle, C35, Joseph Chotiner, C36,
Daniel Dixon, C35, and John Vochko,
C37, were the successful candidates.

Tryouts, based on delivery and con-
tents of ﬁve-minute discussions on
the guarantee of bank deposits as
provided for in the Glass-Steagall
banking act, were judged by the de-
bate coaches, W. M. Parrish and Rich-
ard Murphy.

Applicants for further tryouts

Schramm Talks
To Inquiry Club

Juvenile Court System Subject Of
Address By Candidate

 

 

“Pennsylvania's juvenile court sys-
tem is in for a new deal."

This was the theme of an address
given before the Inquiry club last
Wednesday by Dr. ‘Gustav L.
Schramm, associate professor of po-
litical science, attorney, and Demo-
cratic candidate for judge of the
juvenile court.

For the first time in the state's his-
tory, Dr. hchramm said, the juvenile
court will have its own judge. This
is due to the new judiciary act passed
last May by the state legislature to
;take eﬁect in January, 1934.

 “Considering the fact,” Dr. Schramm
-‘explained, “that between ﬁve and six
:thousand cases are brought before this
jcourt every year, the system with one
~jud-ge in sole charge will be an ex-
itreme beneﬁt.”

3 ~ According to Dr. Schramm the fea-
-ture of the new court will be the ab-

"-sén'ce of any sentences. Each child
wviil be given individual training with
-the” purpose of reforming rather than
:p'uii‘ishing_

"Touching on the powers of the

fjiiifge, Dr. Schramm explained that
tire training, the choosing of homes,

State And City Leaders Laud Conference Here

I view every conference by
American college students and
other educated people in regard

to politics and other govern-
mental questions with great inter-
est, It goes without saying that
the foundation of democracy is
educated public opinion, and it
should be expected that the
American colleges will take the
lead in training men and women
for public life as is done in Eng-
land. I am going to get a great
deal of pleasure out of addressing
the Student Municipal Conference
at the University of Pittsburgh,
and I hope that I shall be able to
provoke an animated discussion
of the ideas I shall present.

Graduate Writes
NRA Theme Song

Johnson Thanks Epstein For
Campaign Composition

Joseph E. Epstein, BA31, has re-
ceived a letter of thanks from Gen.
Hugh Johnson, administrator of the
NRA, for his composition of a “Cam-
paign NRA Theme Song.” The words
of the song were adapted to the music
of the popular navy march, “Anchors
Aweigh.” It is at present in the hands‘
of the publicity committee, which will
sponsor it throughout the country.

Mr, Epstein graduated in June, 1931,
from the School of Business Admin-
istration, and is a member of the
Business Administration Alumni as.
sociation.

The words of the song are:

Hail, hail, the NRA,

“Buy the Blue Eagle Way."

And turn the wheels of industry

Once more in dear old USA,

So, let's join in harmony

Throughout the land.

Employer, consumer,
hand in hand

together

“And buy the eagle, buy the
eagle way.’’

I certainly am most enthusias-
tically for the organization of stu-
dents to improve local govern-
ment_

The failure of the American
student to take a vital interest in
the government of his city, state
and nation has always much im-
pressed me. This is, of course,
in direct contrast to European
and South American students, so
I am delighted to receive from
you an indication that there is
an awakening consciousness of
governmental problems among
students. I have come to believe
that this is a widespread change
in attitude. I am all for it.

One of the important things we
need to make government honest,
intelligent and free from graft
and inefficiency is the active in-
terest of the intelligent young
men and young women of the na-
tion. All power to you in your
public-spirited project.

with all good wishes for the
continuing success of your con-
ference.

“Locomotive” Cheers Greet Herron,

 

First-Hand Experience ‘On Raleigh, Bunyan Gained As
Students Prepare “Pittmen’s Progress”

 

Zzzziiiisssss! Boooom! Rah! Mayor
Herron!

Lusty cheers for Mayor Herron and
Magistrate Thomas D. Jones greeted
the announcement in Morals Court at

were free to leave Number One police
station and go back to study econom-
ics and zoology. Led by Edison
Struble, Pitt cheerleader and spokes-
man for the group, the cheers rever-
berated through the stolid, grim walls
of “good old Number One” following
an announcement by Magistrate Jones
that they were all discharged-

The Pitt group received ﬁrst hand
information on how Sir Walter Ra-
leigh, John Bunyan, and other writers
in history felt behind prison walls.
Following an unauthorized parade:
through town, organized to celebrate-
Pitt’s victory over Notre Dame, the
students soon found themselves in
“good old Number One” a la Raleigh,
Bunyan, et al. “Pittmen’s Progress,"
a new allegorical addition to Ameri-
can literature, might well be a result
of Pitt’s invasion of Number One.

The students were released late
Monday afternoon on their own recog-
nition and were ordered to appeal‘ 111
Morals Court at 9 o’clock Yesterday
morning. Following a hearing in
Morals Court, Magistrate Jones or-
dered the students held for court,
and 23 disappointed Pittmen retreated
to the side-rooms of Number One. At
12:45 o’clock yesterday, the group was

released after an admonition from
Magistrate Jones, Shaking hands

with patrolmen, sergeants, and cap-‘ , ,

tains alike, the Pitt boys left Number
One unanimously agreeing “They're
a. great bunch down here!” Loud
were their praises of Mayor Herron,
Magistrate Jones, and
Schnurr.

Walter J. Rome, assistant dean of
men, William Daufenbaugh, assistant
to the dean of men, and John P.
Bracken, C34, president of Omicron
Delta Kappa, worked yesterday and
Monday in behalf of the imprisoned
students. Contrary to other newspa-
per reports neither Bracken nor John
Holbrook, E34, was a leader of Mon-
day's demonstration.

Speakers Now!

 

Pitt students! Tomorrow and Fri-
day afternoon in 315 Alumni hall is
your chance to ﬁnd out what Pitts-
burgh’s two mayoralty candidates are
doing, saying and promising.

Mayor Herron will be here tomor-
row and William N. McNair Friday,
as speakers for the student.

Mr. McNair and Mr. Herron are
ready for any and all questions that
will be asked. The mayor has stated
that his entire talk will be extem-
poraneous and guided by student
questioning. Mr. McNair has decided

:to talk on a speciﬁc point of munici-

pal government; he, too, will endeavor
to answer as many questions as he
can,

Mr. McNair will speak on “Economic
Law in Municipal Affairs." McNair
will show that if a municipal govern-
ment were run according to economic
laws, that even high school students
are acquainted with, that the present
morass of economic, social and polit-
ical conditions in municipal govern-
ment would be considerably relieved.

Chi Rho Nu Plans
Events For Year

Committee To Decide Eligibility
Of Scholarship Candidates

Election of ofﬁcers and discussion
of plans for the coming year featured
the ﬁrst meeting of Chi Rho Nu,
men's honorary pre-medical fraternity,
which took place last week. Ofﬁcers
elected are: Edward Brethauer, C35,
president; Joseph F, Novak, C35, vice
president; Angelo Petralgia, C35, sec-
retary; and Paul Estep, C35, treas-
urer. Dr. A. B. Walgren and Dr.
Omar C. Held, the latter an honorary
tappee of the organization last year,
were appointed faculty advisers for
the coming year.

The scholarship award plaque
which the fraternity secured last year
was discussed, and the following com-
mittee, assisted by Dr. Held, was
elected to investigate candidates for
the award; Paul Estep, C35, chair-
man, Jaiiies Milligan, C35, and Angelo
Petralgia, C35, The award, which
will be made within the next few
weeks, will be given to some male
member of the pre-medical class who
has completed two years of work, has
maintained a 2.5 quality point average,
and has excelled in scholarship, char-
acter, and service to the University.
After the announcement of the award,
llilhtilll plaque will be placed in State

a .

Chi Rho Nu will hold its annual fall
tapping within the next month. Jo-
seph Novak, C35, chairman, Paul
Estep, C35, and Richard Nies, C35
have been appointed to investigate
eligible men.

Chi Rho Nu has been informed that,
from twenty-ﬁve of its members who
applied to various medical schools
throughout the country, twenty-two
have been accepted.

Several clinics and trips to some of
the county and state institutions have
been planned for the year by James
Milligan, C35 and his assistant, Jack
Kurtz, C35. No deﬁnite action was
taken on the discussion of plans for
a smoker for freshman pre-medical
students.

Hallock Says “Amendment
Must Pass For State's
Social Security”

Nov. 7 Is Voting Day!

There is a new chant in the Gen-
eral Alumni association ofﬁce and it
begins and ends with: “Mail those
cards!"

“These cards” refer to the penny
mailing cards that students, faculty,
administration members and alumni
will receive this week. The cards con-
tain vital information about Amend-
inent 8 to the state constitution. This
is a voluntary undertaking and the
Alumni association is depending upon
the friends of the University to carry
it on.

If Amendment 8 fails to pass the
voters on November 7, Pennsylvania's
1,000,0-00 unemployed and their 2,000,.
000 dependents will face hunger and
mlsery. even possible starvation.

Higher education, too, will be crip-
pled. The University's budget, for in.
Stance, will be slashed almost $400,-
000. The effect of this cut woum be
most disastrous to the University's
service to the community, not only
ifg; the present but for years to fol-

State-aided hospitals will have to
make drastic cuts in their aid to the
impoverished sick, and some hospitals
will curtail such aid altogether.

_ The state-aided educational institu-
tions that are affected by Amend-
ment 8, besides Pitt, are University
Of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State
college, Temple university, Women's
Medical college of Pennsylvania, Jet.
ferson Medical college, Hahnemann
Medical college, Philadelphia museum,
Pennsylvania Museum and School of
Industrial Art, Moore institute, Down-
ingtown Industrial and Agricultural
school, Commissioners of Navigation,
Nautical school, National Farm school,
ind Johnson Industrial school, Scran-

on.

“From the best of information,”
said J. W. Hallock, secretary of the
General Alumni association, “if the
bond issue should fail, raising of
enough money for unemployment re-
lief and hospital relief, by the quick-
est possible means, would not be
appreciable until March 1 of next
year. And since it is apparent that
many communities cannot carry on
their relief work, they are going to
suffer because of the lack of fore-
sight of our voters. Not only that,
but failure of the state to provide
its own relief makes it automatically
ineligible for federal grants. Amend-
ment 8 must pass for the social se-
curity of our state.”

H2504 Play Fails To Cinch
Chems’ Game Against Mets

 

Metallurgists, Chem Engineers Mount Up 0-0 Score In
Bloodless Battle At Practice Field

After three weeks of determined

practice the football teams of -the
metallurgy and chemical engineering
departments; met on the football prac-
tice ﬁeld to decide who was to control
the twelfth ﬁoor of the Cathedral. At
the end of an hour of bloodless battle,

the metallurgists became the moral.

victors, although the actual score was
0-0. (But what can you expect with
Arthur Johnson and George Webb,
chemical engineering instructors, act-
ing as referee and head linesman?)
The metallurgists, outweighed by
about 20 pounds, oﬁered resistance
like the steel they make in their blast
furnaces, and functioned like the
oiled machines in their department.
Such perfect unison made the famous
Chem HZSO4 play futile every time.
Steel absorbed the none too strong
acid. The poor Chems couldn't make
H and 0 into water, because the Mets
smothered their plays, and shut off all
the 0.
Among

the outstanding players

Formal

were: John Mclver, Met coach, who
played right half, and George Blean
who executed some fancy plays (and
a couple of Chems in the bargain).
Charlie Bower, the one half of the
Bower brother act, was supposed to
play center but usually was found in
the Chem backﬁeld, while Tom Col-
lins played fullback. Red Bedilllon
carried the ball so far that he became
too tired to reach the goal.

Strange as it may seem, the Mets
all agree that full respect is due
Joe Mastrucci, Chem half, who would
have made a better spectator than
player as far as they were concerned.

Now that the game is over, all that
the Mets have to fear is the fact that
the Chem oﬂice is just around the
corner. This was the ﬁrst game in a
series of three that ended in a score-
less tie, for the Chems won last year
and the Mets won the year before.
But we still credit the Mets with a
moral victory, though we can’t crown
the champion,

Today’s Conference

.l'i.‘ll l\lAYOl:l J OHN S. HERRON and Demo-

cratic candidate for mayor, \Villiam N. Mc-
Nair, heading the list of prominent speakers, the
YM-YVVCA Conference on Municipal Problems
opens on the campus at 12:30 o’clock today. Rob-
ert Garland, a mem-
ber of the City coun-
cil, will address the
opening meeting of
the affair on “\Vl'iat.
Are The Issues?”

Sliartiug with the
Model Political con-
vention which took
place on the campus
three years ago, in-
creasing interest has
been shown in these
conferences which
deal d i r e c t l y with
problems of govern-
ment and economics. The '[)lal',f0l'lll adopted by
the Model Political COll\'€lll'lCll three years ago in-
cluded most of the points in government as they
are being worked out today under President Roose-
velt.

The conl’crcnce today, in considering municipal
problems, iicachcs. the core of the present campaign
for city oftices. A.ltl1.ough by no means “polit-
ical,” the con ference will discuss freely every item
of governmental work in Pit‘tsl~nnfgl1 from taxation
to judiciary reforms.

The results of such a conference are two-fold.

First, attention is brought to the student body on
the campus of the intensity and importance of cer-
tain lnunicipal issues. Second, st,nde.nt.s are given
opportunity to discuss freely and to offer sugges-
tions concerning the vital problems of city admin-
istration.
' In addition to Mr. Hcrron and Mr. McNair, the
leaders who will appear before sessions of the con-
l’orence are men who liave had considerable expe-
rience in municipal affairs. Dr. Scllramm, Judge
Smith, Councilman Garland, Dr. McCabe, Dr.
\Vatson, and Mr. Ihlder are all experts ;in each par-
ticular field. The conference has everything it
takes for success.

Chartered Jurisdiction
‘VHBITIIJER OR NOT ODK and Druids should be
brought under charl:ers from student relations com-
mittee of f?ill2.tlOl1l'. Council  the first question of import-
ance that al'i'.‘~.‘(‘3 is-oni the activities of the committee
which is izivertigating campus organizations. Although
under the jurlscliclion of lZnl‘m-fra.ternit.y council, Druids
complied with the request. of the investigators and sub-
mitted themselves to the sc.ru.t.lny of the group. There
is notliing in the delegated powers of the committee,‘ as

far as we have been able to learn, that could have given -

them authority to force Druids to appear, had Druids not
wished to. Behind closed doors in secret session Druids
and the members of Ray McCune's committee have been
threshing things out and although it has been agreed
that nothing be cllsclosed early, considerable matter of
student interest has been uncovered.

Both ODK and Druids should be chartered organiza-
tions under student relations committee. If for no other
reason than to give investigations committees in the fu-
ture some deﬁnite jurisdiction. ODK and Druids, al-
though honorary fraternities, are closely allied to the ac-
tivities on the campus‘ a.nd should have some common
link. Most certainly we should not wish to disregard
the powers of lnterfrateruity council, and perhaps joint
cl1art.ers for ODK and Druids might be arranged.

Plahhing And Doing

OUR OF THE NINE POINTS in the Druid two-year

plan which was passed recently by the sophomore
honorary group deal direcl;ly with tapping and, as such,
show that Druids have recognized the weakest point‘ in
their o1'gam'zation. Tapping methods employed by
Druids have long been centers of conflict on the campus
and, disregarding personalities, Druids have been alto-
gether at fault. A

Point two in the program, the naming of the tappee's
activities and his degree of participation in them, is by
far the most progressive part of the program. Druids
have now made it difficult to “create” activities for

obtaining for Druids the most active freshmen on the

Requiring from activities leaders letters containing the
specific degree of participation in their activities of
Druid petitioners is another. commendable point. The

plan lies in the possible politics than CAN be played.
Mere laying down of-certain rules and regulations does
notexclude the ever-present desire to play politics.
The plan as a whole is commendable and is a step for-
ward which promises to work for the best interests of
Druids.‘ We are convinced that Edward Durkln, presi-
dent of Druids, is sincerely interested in the welfare of
that organization. We can readily forget the‘ activities
of Druids in the past if this year’s group puts forth all
its energies in their proposed two-year program.
However, Druids must be ever watchful of that native
huma.n‘ten'den-cy toplay politics. Ithasn’t worked for
thebest interests of Druids oz-any other orga.niza.tion in

NRA, unlike Gaul, stands divided into four parts. First,
the national a.:lm§ni.=;tration under Mr. Roosevelt and Mr.

found a woman hit with a car out in
front. They're bringing her in here.
Tliis is terrible. I think shes dying.”

They laid her out on the couch in:
the back room, her thin claw—like-,
hands rigid in pain, her g’1‘<"z~Y hail‘
falling in dirty profusion over the
pillow and the blood dripping off her
sharp nose and running down the
wrinkles of her neck. “Mayview. May-
viow,” she groaned. The room was
full of curious passers-by who stood
with their hats in their hands and
watched the blood dry and blacken.
Some one had phoned for a doctor.
Norman, with his arm aI‘01111d his
mother’s shoulder thought! “What 3
devil of a mess there's going to be
to clean up after this.”

An old man knocked on the door
and wanted to know if “This here is
the place where the accident was.”
He pushed his way through the crowd
to the side of the couch and with a
gnarled thumb pulled up her wrinkled
eyelid, ”

“Who is she? Do you know her?”
was asked around the room. “She’s
my wife,” the old man grunted. “l
work at Mayview. I called the am-
bulance. They’ll be here in a minute.”

By the time the ambulance got
there and a huge man who looked as
if he was used for his strength and
not for his gray matter, lifted her
on to the streizclier, she was singing-
“Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie."
The old lady was stewed.

There was a devil of a mess to
clean up after they took her away.
Norman went back to his typewriter,
and while his mother pulled the bloody
sheets off the bed, he wrote “A Short
Story, by Norman Rann” and two
lines of “Now is the time for all good
men to come to the aid of their
party,” tore the paper out of the
machine, threw it at the cat and
wished to the devil that he wasn’t
taking short story writing.

The grand march of the Soph Hop} T

 

Friday night will take place at ioﬁ

o’clock instead of at 11 o’clock, in the I —

Schenley hotel ballroom, according to
an announcement by Arthur Stroyd,
C, chairman of the formal affair.
There are a number of contributary
reasons for the step—up in time, Stroyd
states, chief of which is the fact that
during the march the surprise pro-
grams will be distributed. Rather than
have guests do without programs for
the ﬁrst hour of dancing, earlier dis-,
trlbution of programs will be effected
by an earlier grand march. ,
About the programs themselvesg
Stroyd says little. They are not mere-é:
1y programs in the ordinary senseg

of the word, he asserts, neither are;
they what could adequately be termed 
favors. However, a novel combina-I
tion of program and a clever attached ;

feature with future usefulness which;
will prove desirable and delightful to;
the feminine patrons has been de—,
veloped by the committee. At the con-pi
clusion of the grand march these will s
be passed out_ 

He wai'ns that dancers should not-
come expecting to receive elaborate,
favors such as used at University aft
fairs in the dim days 0t_ a1_m°St'f°‘"Z
gotten prosperity and of, inc1dentally,:
excessive dance assessments. On the!
other hand, Stroyd declares that the,
programs evidence. an attempt on the
part of the committee to make the
dance as popular and as profitable for
guests as a $2.50 assessment will make
possible. _ ,

The soph Hop this Week IS I119
most inexpensive one of its variety
on record. Last year the Same affim’
cost $3.00 per couple and although
the programs were decidedly novel
and clever, they Were. Says Stroyd»
of marked inferiority to the cards
fashioned for FridaY- FRVOTS were
not given at the ’35 Soph HOD. They
were also absent at the Senior B311
in June.

A committee of twenty-tW_0 S0IJh_0‘
mores has been meeting Wlth MUS‘
factory success so far in the sale of
tickets for the affair, according to the-
chairman. The ticket campaign W111
be supplemented, beginning today, by
a special booth on the ﬁrst ﬂ00I‘ Of
Alumni hall, where committee mem-
bers will be_ on duty each day until
5 o’clock Friday. _ -

Paul Specht’s Columbia_ and NBC
broadcasting orchestra, . internation-
ally famous for its quality of dance
music, will play for the four hours
of dancing at the hop. The same unit
that played the Inaugural Ball in
March, and which was featured at the
Casino at the Century of Progress.
will augment the well-known maestro
on the band platform at the affalr.

Tickets may be purchased from the

Dean Holbrook Attends
Scientific Coal Meeting

..—...__..

Dr. Elmer A. Holbrook, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines, at-
tended a gathering of the committee
of scientists from all parts of the
United States and Canada who were
interested in forming a complete and
uniﬁed classiﬁcation for the coals of
the two countries, on Thursday after-
noon, October 26.
Was fostered by the American Stand-
ards association and took place at the
United States Bureau of Mines build-
ing.

Dean Holbrook, a member at large
of the committee, presented proposals
for a complete nomenclature to in-
clude all coals of the two countries.
“The movement was started some sev-
en years ago as being largely of scien-
tiﬁc interest only,” said Dean Hol-
brook, “but the recent orders of the
United States government that all dis-
tricts must classify their coals has
made the work of this committee of
tremendous importance.”

S t u d e n t Attendance

At Grid-Graph
“Disappoints”

The student turnout at the Notre
Dame -grid graph assembly in
Memorial hall Saturday afternoon was
disappointing, James Danahey, C34,
chairman of Student Council’s grid
graph committee, declared yesterday.

“It is deplorable,” Danahey re-
marked, “that the Pitt student body
does not take advantage of such
meetings as the grid graph assem-
blies. What surprises me in the low
attendance is that admission was free
and still we could not attract a
large crowd. In buying the graph, we
in Student Council thought we were
supplying a need. I still do not think
we were mistaken.”

Players’ workshop, an old garage by
the side of the stadium.

A big yellow moon, used in the
Indian scene of last year’s Cap and
Gown show, is wedged between boxes
of properties and an oak-stained stair-
case, and a life preserver from the
good ship Stella gives a nautical ef-
fect to the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

Saturday is work day on the second
ﬂoor of the shop. Dorothy Miller and
Hazel Culbertson, in smeary over-
alls, slap steaming glue on a piece
of old canvas that is being done over
for the coming play. Spaulding Fegely
and Robert McConnell tote around
frames and scenery, and Alice Elson
shows how a leading lady can clean
up a poster room in record time. All
this activity goes on against a back-
ground of lighting ﬁxtures, tin milk
cans of dry paint, posters of chorus
girls and scenery, efﬁciently stacked
in wooden ﬁles. They’ve got every-
thing: gondolas, papier-mache trees,
ironing boards, trellises, book cases,
igloos, and electric light bulbs that
would cost you your week’s lunch
money. And of course there’s the
famous piece of property that Carl
B, Cass, director of Pitt Players, con-
structed for “Craig’s Wife" last year.
On close inspection, it is a brown
bench smeared with varied-colored
paint; on the stage it becomes a per-

fect replica of a grand piano, .

Right now Charles Foreman, member
of Pitt Players, has almost completed
a set. There is a secretary desk with
real joints, a bronze ink stand made
out of a hollowed bead, a quill pen
made from a. pilfered canary feather
dyed green, and a postage stamp
copy of the Saturday Evening Post,
the printing done under a hand mi-
croscope. And a set of furniture, up-
holstered in bright green explains why
a certain Pitt News reporter hadn't

Irish Hold Cats
To Ill--O Margin

Sebastian, Weisenbaugh Count
For Only Pitt Touchdowns

 

A much improved Notre Dame foot-
ball team succeeded in holding the

powerful Golden Panthers to a two-
touchdown margin of victory at South
Bend, Indiana.

The Panthers were held scoreless
in the ﬁrst period, but their superior
offense told, and in the second quar-
ter they scored twice, “Mike” Se-
bastian, southpaw halfback, broke
loose early in the period from the
Pitt 25-yard line to run 75 yards for
a touchdown. Onder place kicked the
extra point. Later in the period,
after a pretty pass from 0’Dell to
Sebastian had placed the ball in scor-
ing position, Weisenbaugh took the
ball over. He place-kicked the extra
point.

The defeat for the Ramblers was
their third defeat on their home ﬁeld
in thirty years of playing. They lost
in 1928 to Carnegie Tech and in 1931
to Southern California.

Harriers Meet Defeat
At Notre Dame, 26-29

The Panther cross-country team
went down to its ﬁrst defeat of the
season Saturday at South Bend be-
fore the strongest team Notre Dame
has put out in the past decade. Headed
by King, Canadian cross-country in-
dividual champion and member of
the Canadian Olympia team, the Irish
swept through to a 26-29 victory.

Wagenhauser, of the Panthers, put
up a splendid ﬁght and ﬁnished a
scant yard behind King. to take sec-
ond place. Albright ﬁnished in fourth
position for the Panthers, Kirkpat-
rick came in sixth and Musico and
Lawrence captured eighth and ninth
places, respectively, to give the locals
their total.

 

 

3O Novice Cagers
End Annual Meet

Six Teams Close Tourney With
Ice Cream “Chaser”

 

With a fast round of basketball
competition between six teams, the
Avalons, Emericks, Specs, Greens,
Roscoes and Lankys, the second an-
nual men’s novice basketball tourna-
ment came to a close Friday after-
noon. The outstanding feature of the
last day of the tournament was the
consumption of two gallons of ice
cream, furnished and served by Dr.
H. Clifford Carlson, head basketball
coach and sponsor of the games.

From Monday to Friday, the novices
donned their various basketball uni-
forms every afternoon at 3:30 o'clock
and got a real insight into the inner
workings of Pitt basketball as it is
played. The boys were under the
tutelage of Dr. Carlson, Dr. George
F. Kowallis, assistant varsity coach,
and Paul Zehfuss, freshman coach.

Fifty novices took part in the tour-
ney. That the aﬁair had no_ small
success is evident after watching the
boys in action on Monday and Tues-
day afternoons and then looking over
the same gang on Friday. Shooting
not even close to the hoop, passing
into the tenth row of the stands, and
displaying a surprising ignorance of
fundamentals, the novices lived up
to their name in every sense of the
word at the outset of the tourney.
Friday found them executing some
very intricate maneuvers based on the
Carlson “inside triangles” and “out-
side triangles” methods.

In commenting upon the tourna-
ment Carlson said: “It was great and
so was the ice cream."

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1933

By Robert

A DAY OFF

We thought that perhaps Pitt stu-
dents had really grown up, However
it seems as though some of them
are still like high school students . . .
anything for a day’s vacation from
school.

We thought perhaps they would
come to realize that when the Panther
football team wins, no matter who
their opponent be. it is no cause for

unusual celebration. Our question is,
“Why make a fuss over beating any
school in the country?” It’s for them
to celebrate should they be able to
beat Pitt.

We cut one class Monday but we
were going to see Mae West anyhow.

THAT ANNOUNCER

While we’re throwing bouquets let's
as well pan that NBC announcer who
murdered the Pitt-Notre Dame game
via the air. If we were a certain col-
umnist we would present him with a
whole bushel of onions.

Sportorial . . . .

E. Badger

Pitt News Sports Editor

"MIKE"

In our opinion the most dramatic
incident of the current football sea-
son was the 76-yard run of Michael
John Sebastian for the ﬁrst touchdown
against the Irish. You know history
repeats itself-

 

IRON MAN

While we’re throwing bouquets let's‘
toss one to George Shotwell, elon-
gated Panther center. He played
sixty minutes of football against, the
1I&ish' in Saturday’s game. A real Iron-

an.

 

NEXT SATURDAY

And now for Centre, The Panthers
should win easily, but there may be
trouble. Last week Centre defeated
Xavier of Cincinnati. the same team
that held Tech to a 3 to 0 score, by
a 7 to 0 count. They also held the
strong Boston college team, one of
the strongest in the east, to a 7 to
0 score. ’
