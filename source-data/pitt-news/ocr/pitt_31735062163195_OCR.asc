Chancellor Litchﬁeld pointed out
-that the number of applicants has
increased “dramatically” over last
year. There were 155 applicants
this year as compared to the '94
last year. ‘ '
Achieving Goal

“We are delighted that so many
have taken advantage of this un-
usual opportunity for advanced
study” Litchﬁeld. said. “It is
gratifying. evidence of the in-
creasing national interest in both
the predoctoral and postdoctoral
Andrew Mellon'Fellowship. It re-
presents substantial progress to-
ward realizing the goals which
the Trust and the University had
in view when the fellowship pro-
gram was established.”

The fellows will receive sti-
pends of $2,700 to $3,700 for
three ‘trimesters, or $2,000 to
$2,800 for two trimesters. In
eithercase the award includes
remission of tuition.

Anew night school program is
in the ‘planning _stage whereby
adults may earn a degr_ee inpsix
or seven years, instead of the cus-
tomary ten or eleven years.
The proposed School of General
Studies is designed for adults who

failed to reach college. It has
been approved by the University

cellor and the Board of Trustees
for their‘ approval. ,
Under this plan, a‘dults,would

be admi-tteda without taking‘ an en-
. trance or" aptitude test, and their

performance would ' de t e r m i n e
their eligibility to continue. '

Bachelor degrees would be
awarded in Liberal Arts, Educa-
tion, Nursing, and Business Ad-
ministration. The new school
would feature all the .upder-
graduate courses now given, and
some additional ones.

As the plan now stands, persons
under 21 would not beadmitted to
the school, since the‘ school would
be designed especially to meet
the needs of adults rather than of
younger students. .

A ‘ policy paper announcing
broad revisions in the proposed
School of General Studies was
presented by Dean Viers W.
Adams to the Senate ‘Council.
The school; is expected to" be:
launched in April 1961.

One of the ‘proposals is that
most faculty. members be drawn
from the current staff on the basis
of qualification and desire to teach
in such a program.

Evening graduate work shall be
continued by departments now

Changes Made  Degree

New University regulations gov-
erning the awarding of a Ph.D.
degree have been announced by
Dr. Putnam F. Jones, dean of the

graduate faculty. The purpose is
to strengthen the effectiveness
and increase the flexibility of
work done at that level.
7 The new regulations were draft-
ed by the University Council on
Graduate Study, and approved by
members of the graduate faculty
and the Chancellor, Dr. Edward
H. Litchﬁeld.

vAccording to the regulations,
the minimum -residence require-
ment for a Ph.D. applicant is six
terms of full time study or the
equivalent. The last three terms
must have been completed at the
University. _

0 should proﬁt from their pioneering.

 

During the past ﬁfteen weeks, students in a large urban
University have had a taste of small college life.

The ﬁrst spring trimester, with its enrollment of 5,000
full and part time students, is now drawing to a close. It
can be termed a success, and we can be reasonably certain
that it is here to stay.

‘Many students have expressed the opinion that there
is less pressure this term, makingit more pleasant than

A other terms. Perhaps the feeling of these students will in-

ﬂuence others to attend the third trimester. Then we will
have the hoped for equal enrollment in each of the three

' ‘ terms.
\

The improvements needed for future spring trimesters
have been pointed out by this ﬁrst one. Most importantly,

. -a more reliable way will have to be found to determine in

advance how many students plan to attend. Then a suffi-
cient number of classes and an adequate supply of text
books can be made available to students. "

A need also exists to attract more resident students.
This term less than 3% of the total number of students
enrolled were resident students. One of the purposes of

the trimester system is to utilize more fully the physical

plant. If this trimester is any indication, our increasing
number of residence halls will not be used.

The lack of facilities for outdoor recreation and of.

student activities is a handicap to third trimester success.
Hopefully, student groups will see the need for scheduling

events and planning meetings in the third term. The stu-

dent Union has set an outstanding example of planning
activities for a smaller student body. Other organizations

These are some of the changes that should be brought

«about by next spring. Indeed, they are minor criticisms
~_ when one stops to think how much could have been amiss
sduring the ﬁrst year of the trimester experiment.

The program skeptics’ have called “unrealistic” has
proved that it can work. All that remains is for a few

~minor ﬂaws to be corrected‘.

 Critical Moment . . .»

Troubles In The Congo

By Rodger D. Yeager
There has occurred an explosion in South West
Africa, an explosion which shakes the world as no
hydrogen bomb could.

In the recently created Republic of the Congo,
there are native riots against their former gov-

ernors, the Belgians. There is talk of provinces

pulling away from the union.
The premier himself has stated
that if the Belgian troops donot
withdraw, he will personally
seek outside military aid, per-
haps Soviet. And the Belgians
are defying this ultimatum.

To a people not schooled in
democratic tradition, democracy
comes hard. Such is the plight of
the Congolese. Having lived un-
der Belgian rule for over a hun-
dred years, they have had no ex-
perience with democracy.

An U nprepared Awakening

And since they have realized the concept of
the national state without the benefit of such ex-
perience, they have thus emerged, from a colonial
position to a national one without knowledge of
the concept of democracy, let alone its organiza-
tional aspects. . l

The fault, then, is not of the Congolese,’ but of
the Belgians. The rulers have failed to properly
educate their wards for the inevitable day when

Balcler — clashes . . .

By Jim Vaughan .' »

From several literary news sources, as well as
Time magazine, Pitt people have -been reading
about how the University. of Pittsburgh has be-
come a forward-looking progressive -center of

' learning. While reveling in this new-found glory,

the University has forgotten to clean out all of
its cupboards. In fact Pitt has
cluttered certain ones further.

In its foreign language re-
quirements for undergraduates,
Pitt has maintained and even
strengthened an archaic educa-
tional practice.

Students in the School of Lib
eral Arts must earn two years’
worth of credits in a modern

 

graduate. This they can do by
taking a language exemption
examination, by studying (and passing) one lan-
guage for two years, or by combining a test with‘
formal study. Regardless of the method, two years
they must. 1 '

Knowing this, most students decide to study a
particular foreign language for two years——often
one already studied in high school._

The ﬁrst day, textsin hands, they walk into

class. Seated they listen to an inspired speech on '

the merits of studying this foreign language, and
take notes on the assignment. Class over, they walk
out scared and impressed by the amount _of work
involved in learning the language.

Throughout the ﬁrst_ year, those who haven’t
dropped the language follow a- hard schedule:
they attend practically every class, suffer through
the hour trying to appear interested and hoping not
to be called on, leave class with sighs of relief,
proceed through the ‘day, go home, study that lan-
guage for a length of time disproportionate with
that spent on their other studies, and go to sleep
feeling unprepared for class the next day._This al-
most desperate struggle goes on ﬁve days each

week for the first year. \

.Almost Pleasant ,

Students ﬁnd studying their language a ‘little
easier the next year. Now they meet only three
days alweek. And they are beginning to discover
that they can almost make themselves understood
in another language, and, more important, under-
stand a little of. what they hear and read.

By the end of the second year these veteran
students of French or German or what not are
ﬁnally ﬁnished with their burdensome language
requirements. _

They happily pack their second-year texts away
in some dusty book case (besides their ﬁrst-year
texts) never to l_ook into them again. For the rest
of their lives most of them utter no more than a’
thousand words~in their- newly acquired tongue,
andtranslate probably no more thana hundred.

 

 

they would seek their freedom. They have, rather,
ruled them poltically while exploiting them eco-
nomically.

Even after serious independence riots in'l959,
King Baudouin made his intentions_clear when he
guardedly stated, “Our ﬁrm resolution is to lead
the Congolese populations, without harmful pro-
crastination, but also without undue haste, toward
independence.” Judging by the past record of
colonialism, “without undue haste” meant ﬁfty to
one hundred years. '

This period would provide, to King Baudouin,
plenty of time to democratize the Congolese. But
events were moving too fast. - _.___

Now, when independence has been achieved,
the Belgians continue to assert their un-democratic
colonial will.‘ The Belgian army still insists that
the'Congolese army’ constitutes Congolese citizens
with Belgian oﬁicers.

‘ The White Symbol

' ‘Is it any wonder that the Congolese react vio-
lently against not only the Belgians, but the very.
symbol of oppression,‘ the whites.

It is now the task of the democracies of the,_,_ ”.«.

world to encourage the Congolese in their nation-
alistic struggle and to aid them in t'he.develop-
ment of their own democratic tradition. ‘-

Congolese democracy will not be achieved by

 western condemnation, but will certainly be with

western help. Without‘ this help, there is only_ one _l

other course" of Congolese development, dictator-
ship, chaos and perhaps Communism’s ﬁrst strong-
hold in the dark continent. ‘

Merely Academic

But no. In a truly academic manner the Uni-
versity, instead, wastes the valuable time of many
good students by making them spend hours each

night for two years learning something which they

soon forget. This waste’ extends to graduate stu-
dents. — é 0‘ '

To this requirement the Division of Natural

Sciences had added another: Ph.D.s must now dem- J

The graduate student, after passing his compre-
hensive, ispand should be treated as a mature com-
petent adult.

But no, the language requirement says that he
cannot judge for himself. Worse yet, it causes him
a great deal of anxiety and wastes valuable time.
When he ﬁnally does pass his graduate language
exams, he proceeds quickly to discard these lan-'
guages supposedly learned at Pitt.

Pitt’s foreign language requirements are ves-
tiges of the early times when every student in
college studied Greek, Latin, and Mathematics in
order to discpline and sharpen his mind. It should‘
now be scrapped. And in its place the University
might consider making a new and revolutionary.

degrees to ﬁrst demonstrate reasonable proﬁciency

This theme is enough of the
story to ‘make reading the book

is that Ike-o Hartwell, around
