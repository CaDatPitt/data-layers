’Although this sport has gained much favor in several sections of the
country, notably on the Paciﬁc coast and in Philadelphia where the
‘Penn Relays*a*rp=aannnaily held, it has never caught the fancy of the

public-s-in‘.-.this district.

. * e_ﬁe'reasonifox‘¥1:his‘dappamdt=.lack- of-' interest rests in the nature of
the sport. Track and field does not involve the bodily contact which
characterizes such sports as football and basketball which have proven
popular. Even boxing in its first season here drew more spectators per
' match than did the track team of last Year.

You may blame this result on the animal nature in human

beings and argue that the killer instinct should have no place

in sports, much less in collegiate ones; but the people of the

~\tri-state district prefer the rugged sports over those in which °

bodily contact plays no part.

swimming, rifle, cross-country and tennis, which are simi-
‘lar to track and field in the above respect, have also failed to

attract even fairly large crowds during the time they have been

varsity sports at the University.

They require stamina, skill,

brains and speed of their performers the same as the other
three sports mentioned above do, but they lack that vital some-
thing which places the other three on the top rung of the popu-

larity ladder.

Another reason for lack of student enthusiasm has been the lack

_ of truly great performers in the sport.

And with such weightmen as Harlow Rothert,

To be frank, this district has not been lacking in feature perform-

Frank Shea in the 440, Ted Corbett in the 2-mile run, Gibby Welch in
the weights, Everett Utterback in the broad jump, Don Gwinn in the

Pitt to Meet
Navy Eleven

Schedule Eight Boxing
Meetsmfor 1933

 

 

A two year gridiron contract be
tween Pitt and Naval Academy, the

complete - Panther-«boxing. schedule .

for 1933, and a change in next sea-
son's basketball schedule were all
announced last week by the Pitt

athletic department.

The football pact calls for two
games between the Pitt eleven and
the Naval Academy team. The first
game is scheduled to take place at
the Pitt stadium on October 14,
1933, and the second to take place
in the following year at a place and
on a date that is, as yet, undeter-
mined. It is likely that the second
match will be held at Baltimore.

The two year series with the
Middles will supplant a contract of
equal length with the Army team,
which ends with the clash between
the Panthers and the Soldie.rs...next
fall.

The Pitt “B" eleven will again
meet the Navy “B" team during the
approaching season on the former's
field. These two teams met for the
first time last year.

The game next year will be the
sixth in grid history between the
two schools. Pitt has won three,
tied one and lost one to date.

The Pitt boxing schedule for
1933 contains eight matches, four
meets at home and four away. Five
meets will be staged in conjunction
with basketball games, two of
these at the Pitt Stadium.

The Pitt boxers will meet West
Virginia at the Stadium on the
samenight as the Panther five
plays the Mountaineers here, and
later in the season the ring team
will engage W. and J., here in a
meet in conjunction with the Pitt-
W. and J. basketball game.

The Panther boxers will also
meet Army, Navy and West Virgin-
ia in meets held on the same night
and at the same place as basket-
ball games,' but the sites will be
the home floors of the teams oppo-s-
ing Pitt.

Three new foes, Duquesne, Navy

olis, the other two at the Stadium.
Two schools, Penn State and Syra-
cuse, which were met last year, are
no longer on the schedule.

Five of the seven schools on the]
schedule are members of the East-’
ern lntercollegiate Boxing Confer-
ence, of which Pitt is also a mem-
ber and which was formed only
last year. Army and Navy, which
are to be met, are not in the Con-
ference. . ,

It was also announced last week
that the date for the Pitt-Carnegie

Beef Trust Assembles for
Grid Practice

 

 

The Congressional Committees
for eliminating trusts of all
kinds will soon be looking into the
matter of the-beef trust that as-
sembles daily on the practice field
behind Trees Gym where it listens
to the wisdom handed out by Coach
Sutherland and his host of assist-
ants.

Of course the University does
not control the beef market of

the world, but after creeping past-

several suspicious managers, and
observing at close range the as-
sembled tonnage, one can readily
imagine what the great plains of
the_West used to look like when
cowboys lulled the great herds of
cattle to sleep with their quaint
Western lullabies.. The scene shifts
to the practice field where the
coaches certainly do not try to lull
the beef into a passive state, and
most certainly do not use lullabies
of any kind.

Forty odd men assembled daily
to run through the regular forma-
tions, fundamentals having been
polished off. The boys are paired
off in elevens and run through
their plays under Coach Sutherland
and his assistants, Eddie Baker,
Ray Montgomery, Andy Gustafson
and Freshman Coach Skip Gougler.
After a signal practice and tackling
practice have been cove-red, the
teams are sent through regular
scrimmage sessions.

During the scrimmages, players
are shifted rapidly from team to
team, as the punishment for *not
knowing a play is dismissal for the
moment. -

To date, two regular practice
ga.mes have been held, with pros-
pect of another game in the very
‘near future. Not all of the letter-
men of last year are sure of their
berths at present, and the main op-
position is coming from the fresh-
men who have no respect for age
or experience, but can appreciate
beauty.

Rocker, Ormiston, Weinstock,
Shotwell, and L. Wodjidhovski,
head the freshman talent, but none
of those remaining can be definite-
ly counted out for a long, long
time.

Two varsity boxers are seeing
plenty of action, certainly much
more than last year. Francis Sie-
gel, captain elect of the ring squad
seems headed for a guard posi-
tion, and is being used regularly
by Sutherland at that position.
‘Jack Schricker, Eastern Confer-
ence 155 pound champ, has been
shifted from halfback to endand
seems likely to be seen in more
games‘ than last year‘.-\

cation a.t the university.

 

Select Persoimel for

Panther Golf Team

 

Pitt golf prospects have bright-
ened considerably in the past week.
Candidates were given a thorough
tryout last week at the Highland
Country Club and the team has
been selected.

The Wolff brothers, Regis and
Charley, will hold down the first
two places on the team and the
number three. and four positions
will go to Decker and Finlayson.

Regis Wolff, although only a
sophomore, is acting as coach of
the team, the second ‘in Pitt golf

The meet tomorrow will be pat-
terned strongly after the Olympic
carnival. The races will be dis-
tanced according to the metric, or
European system, which is the fash-
ion in the Olympic meet. The
weights will be staged as usual.
- The outstanding member of the
Ohio State team who will take
part in the meet tomorrow is, of
course, Jack Keller, great hurdler.
Keller was a national interschol-
astic champion while 8. student at
East High School in Columbus and

ords in both the low and high
hurdles.
Keller Sensational.

Keller has performed sensation-
ally since he entered Ohio State,
winning first places in outstanding
track meets over almost the entire
..eountry.

The captain of the Ohio State
team is John Black, also a. hurdler
of no mean ability. With Keller
and Black both available, the Buck-
eyes are almost certain to win the
first two places in both hurdle
events, no matter who represents
Pitt.

Two brilliant sprint stars are
coming from Columbus to Pitts-
burgh with the Ohio State trackers.
Don Bennett, sophomore ﬂash, will
run tomorrow with a great record
back of him. Bennett established
world interscholastic records for
the 100 and 220 yard dash at the
Stagg Interscholastic meet three
years ago, competing for Toledo
Libbey High School. .

«-‘Fazekas Great Sprinter.

He is possibly even a little faster
than Bennett in the 100 yard dash
although Bennett is conceded to be
somewhat the better in the 220
yard dash. Bennett hurt his knee
several weeks ago, but is epected to
run tomorrow.

Pete Wonsowitz is another Buck-
eye star. A sophomore pole vault-
er from Gary, Indiana, he has fre-
quently exceeded 13 feet and will
take ﬂrst tomorrow without much
trouble.

Teitelbaum, Lewis and Bittel

Lewis, Thiessen, and Simms will
run the hurdles. These boys are in
a hot spot, facingAKeller and Black,
and they can't be expected to do
much. McConnell and O’Dell will
pole vault, but they will hardly
fare so well against Wonsowlts.

Sebastian is Pitt's best bet in‘

the broad jump. Although not yet
in the best possible form, Mike
looks plenty capablebf taking the
event. From Stirling, Thlessen,
and Miller will come two others to
also take part in the event. If
Kirkpatrick competes tomorrow, he
will be ‘Pitt's hope in the high
jump. Stirling and Sebastian also
will high jump. ,

Valenti_ MacMurdo, and Harder
will shotput. Carver is possibly the
best Pitt discus beaver, and he will
compete in this event tomorrow
with MacMurdo and Valenti. Va-
lenti, MacMurdo and Harder wil.
hurl the hammer. Tormey and '
will throw the javelin.

,  N6 “Limitation?

‘N ANOTHER PART of today’s paper is a communication from

Franklin Kallfelp, who seeks to defend the recent action of
Studeht Council in excepting next year's Military Ball from any

limitation on attendance.

Mr. Kallfelz, in his letter, denies that the ball is a money-
making affair and asserts that with almost 800 students regularly

" enrolled in the R. O. T. C. course, it would have been unfair to
have placed the maximum attendance restriction. of 700 couples on

‘this particular dance.

  

But_ Mr. Kallfelz also admits that ainet profit of $468 was
made on the recent dance, despite the fact that the affair was prob-
ably the most expensive social event ever to be sponsored by un-
ﬁergraduates at the University. That result would seem to place

I the Military Ball in the money-making class!

And Mr. Kallfelz has also apparently _ _ J

- that several members of Student Council were willing to compro-
mise on the attendance problem, by increasing the limitation on

lost sight of theyfact

the ‘Military dance to the enrollment ﬁgures of the R. O. T. C. de-

‘ pertinent.

This would have permitted every student in the Mili-

tary department to attend the affair.

But perhapsthere "is little need to worry, for students may not
soon forget the rather unsatisfactory conditions that existed at the
soldiersieball last-month, which in itself may solve the attendance

problem next Spring.

To the Editor:

Your editorial referring to
the Student Council’s action in
excepting the Military Ball
from the attendance liminita-
tions recently prescribed by

_. the Council is unfair to the
D Council and to the R. O. T. C.

The 700 attendance-limit
prescribed by the Council could
not possibly affect any other
major social function than the
Military Ball, for no other
function this year has had an I
attendance of more than 500.
This limitation, (700) was a.
discrimination against the R.
O. T. C. whose present mem-
bership is now 750 and whose
membership next year will
greatly exceed that ﬁgure.
The Council's action was but

~. I an honest and fair correction’
, of this discrimination.

Your editorial stated “There
is no need of making thisone
dance 8. money making busi-
ness." This insinuatlon of
commercialization is absolutely
unfair. Must the Military Ball
be accused of “commercializ-
ing” solely because it is per-
haps the only major event of,
the University that has not in-
curred a deﬁcit this year? The
large attendance at the Mill-,
tary Ball was due primarily to
the fact for $3.00, the lowest
assessment for any ball on
the campus, the students were
offered a quality of dance mu-
sic that has been stated by
musical authorities to have
been “The greatest‘ musical
combination ever presented by ..
an-y University in the East.”
This music, the favors, and the
ballroom, and perhaps a
friendly feeling towards ‘the.

» R. O. T. C., induced the many

the Military Ball. As for the
“money-making” aspect, the
following speaks for itself.

Your accusations of: “The un- ‘
satisfactory conditions that

prevailed at the Military Ball”
is not substantiatedby any ev-
idence that you have produced.
On the other hand, the man-
agement of the Hotel. William
Penn, ina letter dated March
15, 1932, have said, “From the
hotel’s point of view, the re’-
cent Military Ball was one of
the most successful Univer-
sity dances we have ever had.
While the crowd was quite
large, it was easily handled
and exceptionally orderly.” On
what facts, Mr. Editor, can you
base the assertion to the con-
trary that you have made?‘

In fairness and in justice to
the Student Council and to the
Military Ball Committee the
Pitt Weekly should publish
this letter in its pages. Edi-
torial opinion and comment,
can be whatever you make

_ them, but onlyfacts can estab-
