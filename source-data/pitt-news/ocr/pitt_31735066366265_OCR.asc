Helm Sees Republicans
As ‘Party of the People;’
Urges Responsibility

W. Stuart Helm, secretary of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, told an audience of University Young Re-
publicans in the Student Union Lower Lounge Friday that
“the Republican Party should not consider itself a party of
conservatives or of liberals, but rather the party of the peo-

party.”

Helm cited the Democratic Par-
ty’s ability to close ranks after
hard - fought intra - party power
struggles, and stated that “this is
what we Republicans need to
learn.”

Helm stated that the upcoming
municipal election will be a “Very
important campaign.” The signi-
ﬁcance can be seen by the fact
that people are going to “elect
men that are closer to (them)
than in any other election?’

 Vincent Rovitto, Pittsburgh GOP

mayoralty candidate urged the
audience to “join the ranks. We
need your help. If we are going
to make a change (in city gov-
ernment) we are going to have to
work hard.”

State Senator Jack McGregor,
Allegheny C o u n t y Republican
Chairman George Pott, and YR
College Council State Chairman

. John Gilliland also addressed the

audience.

After the talks, a coffee hour
and general discussion was held
with the speakers.

Budget Crisis Curtails Band Trips;

BAND MEMBERS stand idly during second quar-
ter of home football game. Financial cutbacks

As a result of the Univer-
sity’s budget crisis, the Var-
sity Marching Band will go
on one away trip instead of
the usual two. Robert L. Ar-
thur, director of University
bands, said that the only trip the

pD._-./band would take will be to New

York for the Syracuse game.
The cut was made by Alan C.
Rankin, formepvice-chancellor of

Student Affairs Helen P. Rush
said the band’s budget was cut
out of necessity, although she
had hoped that the allocations

the difference.

Vice-Chancellor Rush added.

Vrana, Vice-Chancellor Rush’s
assistant. “Al1 money for Univer-

“Aside from the hand, all organi-

Too Late for Fall

‘I and AF’ Issue Canceled;

According to Irving N. Roth-
man, director of student publica-
tions, the fall edition of Ideas
and Figures, the University stu-
dent literary magazine, will not
be published as was originally
expected.

In a letter to Editorial Cultura,
the publishing company original-
ly scheduled to print the maga-
zine, Rothman stated: “I do not
believe that it would be possible
to have the fall issue available
before January.”

The reasons why Ideas and Fig-
ures will be delayed till the win-
ter trimester are twofold. Ac-
cording to Rothman, a letter was
sent to Editorial Cultura which
stated that the company was not
to begin work until Ross Daniel-
son, magazine editor, visited the
plant in Mexico. Danielson, last
year’s editor of Ideas and Fig-
ures, never visited the publisher.

The second reason for the de-
lay of the magazine was that Edi-
torial Cultura did not have the
typeface that Danielson had re-
quested and informed no one

about the problem.

Rothman felt that one of the
main problems that hindered the
publication of the fall edition was
“the lack of communication that

prevented our cooperation.” Dan- I

ment.

‘ /versity of Pittsburgh Press. Pitts-

burgh, 1965. 238 pages. Bibliog-

By WOLFRAM W. SWOBODA

_ Whether one believes as Car-
'lyle did that “history is the es-
sence of innumerable biogra-
phies,” or not, Margaret George’s

 -, volume is a brilliant insight into
~  the character of Tory leadership
I-in the 1930’s, and her biography

of this character is highly chal-
lenging and fascinating. Mrs.
George has built .a scholarly case
for a theory which has been felt
intuitively by some his-

"of appeasement was the result of
a fear of the dynamism unleash-

 ed by the Russian Revolution,
’-and challenging Europe’s middle

classes sickened to death by

World War One and by the eco-

nomic crises of the l920’s.
"Beginning with the Russian

0 Revolutions of 1917, Tory circles

began to envision a mediated

ll peace with Germany at the ex-

pense of Russia. -Especially the
October Revolution caused an in-
creasing identiﬁcation on part of
the British conservatives of the
,Bolsheviks with their own Left-
oriented working masses. The
lines between Bolshevism, social-
ism, and social-democracy disap-
peared, seemingly forming a mas-
sive threat, and therefore the
European middle classes tended
to react with interventions in the

  
  
 

R.S.F.S.R. and with reaction at
home.

Mrs. George’s lucid and care-
fully documented description of
the growing anti-democratic sen-
timents in Tory circles domin-
ated by the “league of the medio-
cre” assumes a high degree of
credibility in the light of her evi-
dence. She leads us step by step
into the fears of the solid Eng-
lish businessman and member of
the Cabinet, so that his actions
surprise us increasingly less. They
may amaze or appall us, but they
no longer surprise us. Hence,
Baldwin’s utterances such as: “a
dynamic force is a terrible thing;
it may crush you” is understand-A
able in the light of the conserva-
tives’ perception of the General
Strike of 1926. Churchill’s en-
dorsement of Mussolini, Locarno,
and the Anglo-German Naval
Agreement burying Versailles,
are all steps towards the infam-
ous policy of appeasement.

It is the conceptual framework
of the Tory elite, viewing the
rise of the Fascist dictators as
the salvation of the privileged
classes from the red spectre,
which is the main cause of the
British diplomatic disasters of
the 1930's. As a consequence, it
seemed absurd to Baldwin to sup-
port the League of Nations against
Italian agression in Ethiopia —
an uncivilized colonial "area. The
League was only to be supported
officially in public to-secure an
elective victory in 1935, while in
.actual foreign relations collective

Students Voice Views -

(Collegiate Press Service)
A “Bitch-In on the Multiversity,”
.a vocal referendum on the prob-
lems of student life, has been
scheduled early in October at the
University of Colorado. Modeled
after the teach-ins on Vietnam, the
bitch-in will be aimed at attack-
ing what the student thinks is
wrong with the university, why,
and what can be done about it.
Unlike the teach-ins, however,
there will be no formal planned
speeches. All comments and cri-
ticism will come directly from
I the students themselves.

  At Colorado University

As each student enters the audi-
torium, he will be given a num-
bered IBM card which he will be
encouraged to bend, fold, staple,
or mutilate. In numerical order,
each cardholder will have ﬁve
minutes to sound off.

Sponsored by the National Af-
fairs Commission of the Asso-
ciated Students of the University
of Colorado, the bitch-in is in-
tended not only to allow the in-
dividual student “to get it off his
chest,” but to provide a set of
goals and priorities for action on
the problems of students.‘

0c_;6bei?‘i3, 1965  g  “ ‘

The Warped Vision

 

security was dismissed as idiotic
and in favour of “national inter-
est” and the old balance of pow-
er game.

This “double policy” was only
part of the intricate diplomatic
ballet of rationalization and hy-
procrisy which these miniature
Machiavellis performed. Appease-
ment, as a result, became an
outright policy as demonstrated
by the Hoare-Laval Pact and by
English indifference to the Ger-
man military occupation of the
Rhineland, which was seen mere-
ly as “jerry going into his own
back-garden.”

The Spanish Republic’s call for
help was answered by an en-
dorsement of Franco as Spain’s
20th century El Cid riding in a
crusade against Communist bar-
barism, and by the notorious
“Non-Intervention Agreement”
which, as far as I can discover,

was designed to stop all interven- V

tion on behalf of the Republic,
but allowed 50,000 Italian troops
and the German Kondor Legion
to support Franco. From Spain,
it was only a step to Austria and
Czechoslovakia. Jerry was‘ now
apparently going into his front

’ garden and, after all, Chamber-
lain was only willing to to be"

forceful on “Large issues,” and
not on the behalf of small and
far-away countries. '

Throughout this it is note-
worthy that Britain consistently
refused to join France in an anti-
German alliance for fear of be-
ing “drawn into an alliance with
Russia,” despite the efforts of
Churchill, Eden .and Vansittart.

Margaret George’s case is ex-
tremely well argued and well

" documented, yet she seems at
. times to come dangerously close

to a mono-casual view of British
foreign policy. Certainly, there
can be little doubt as to the solid-
ity of her argument concerning

the ‘Tory vision of the Fascist
dictators. But this vision is not
the only cause of appeasement.
This policy was, .after all, de-
vised not only after the Russian
Revolution, but also after World
War One and its aftermath.

There can be little question as
to the popular desire for peace
at almost any cost, as evidenced
by Norman Angell’s eloquent ar-
gument. Surely to many (survi-
vors of that great tragedy, Czech-
oslovakia must have seemed not
worth the price to pay. To what
extent such considerations in-
ﬂuenced the British elite we do
not know; we do know, however,
that Mrs. George’s analysis of
the British view of Fascism is
certainly valid, and that that
view indeed was extremely in-
ﬂuential in the formation of the
appeasement policy. Her biogra-
phy is not tragic, however, since
there was nothing inevitable in
British foreign policy; there were
always alternatives not only of-
fered by the ‘Opposition, but in
Tory circles themselves.

Rather, her story is pathetic,
since this policy was based upon
illusions — things devoutly to be
wished. I sincerely hope that her
study will provoke controversy-

not for the sake of sterile aca-
demic debate, but because her
scholarship lays bare the many
faulty persuppositions of even
present conservative foreign poli-
cy. Thus, her volume is not a
footnote to the past, but also a
challenge to the present as long
as it is still the case, as Hegel
wrote, that “the few assume to
be the deputies, but are often
only the despoilers of the many.”

 ‘ ,The recently released program for the weekend displays a Void in creativity and
ttractive events. The only creative aspect is the banner contest.

 The contest was instituted last year to replace the ﬂoat contest. Although it is
different, its effectiveness is questionable. Last year there was good participation in part
_due_ to the credit given towards the Student Government spirit award. There is no SG
spirit award this year, eliminating a, necessary impetus for participation.

Homecoming is the big event of this year at all football-oriented campuses. Here

it is as-matter of formality with little of the enthusiasm, pride, and interest.

Letters To The Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:
I read with some interest of

- the resignation of erstwhile Pres-

ident Eric Stern. Of this merci-

. that nothing in it distinguished

it ‘quite so much as its dissolu-

Stern’s behavior suggests a

A‘ politics is the art of the impos-
sible. Never accepting half a loaf

of progress when a whole loaf
of polemics is at stake, he now
would have us believe that de-
mocracy is dead at Pitt.

I submit that this is palpable
nonsense. All that will be lost at

The

that .a Student Government is no
longer necessary. If the Commit-
tee continues to be so omnipo-
tent, weipropose that it center its
energies on improving the Uni-
versity’s ﬁnancial status, and let
the students determine how their
money will be spent on their ac-
tivities. '
However, if the Committee feels
that student affairs falls under
its jurisdiction instead of ours,
perhaps it would be wiser to dis-
pense with Student Government
elections and instead elect the
Student Aitairs administrators.

Seen As Active

Editor, The Pitt News:

Your editorial of Oct. 11 is an-
nother statement of your position
in relation to Student Govern.
ment (SG). Your position in the
past and now remains totally illo-
gical according to the statements
you make.

I was thoroughly amazed by
your editorial statements in this
issue (Oct. 11). You say that SG
must act now on the long range
issues of “allocation of the ac-
tivities fee, constitutional revi-
sion, revision of the University
Handbook, and re-evaluation of
the relation between SG and
Student Affairs Committee.”

By making this statement you
imply that these issues have been
overlooked by SG under the lead-
ership of Eric Stern. You fail to
admit that it was under Stern’s
leadership that these very issues
came to a head. If you will re-

 

1

call, SG’s. of the past have never
been active enough to even be
aware of these vital issues, least
of all act upon them.

It was the Pitt Progressive
Party and Eric Stern that made
the student !body as a whole,
and SG, aware of these issues

and urged them to think about

them and act accordingly.

You call for action now and
have done so continuously in the
past, but you seem totally ignor.
ant of the action that has come to
pass. It seems apparent that the
only action sanctioned by you is
that which remains within the
binds of control from above. This
is not true action, but a pretense
of action, a fairytale that appar-
ently satisﬁes your needs. What
you call for is submissive action.

I regret Eric Stern’s resigna-
tion' merely ,i because he was a
thorn in your side and one that
should not have been removed
so easily.

Expansion Problems

Down at Joe’s Bar

Mr. Janezic is a 1965 graduate of the University and‘ a former
news editor of The Pitt News. The following column is reprinted
from the Feb. 12 issue of the paper.

Everybody was down at Joe’s Bar last Saturday just
sort of sitting around and talking when one of the fellas

noticed his beer glass was dirty. “Hey Joe,” he said. “What-

sa matter. Don’t ya wash your glasses anymore?”

J oe, the bartender and owner, glanced up from drawing
a beer. “We’re "on an economy drive around here,’ ’he said.
“We only wash them every other beer now. Have to cut
down on water and soap suds. Dirties a lot of dish cloths,
too, washing and drying all the time. Nope. We’re just cut-
ting down on a lotta services, that all.”

“How about your kitchen helper?”

“Hadda get rid of him,” said Joe. “And Sally the cook,
too. Can’t afford to have them around.”

“Business bad, huh?”

“NOT THAT. Just that I tried to do too much at once,
that’s all. Things were ﬁne until I decided to build the bar-
room annex. But when I started that I went into the hole.
I just don’t have any more money to play around with,
that’s all.”

The customer looked into his beer. “Guess it kinda
shocked ya, runnin’ out of money.”

“Na. I really should have expected it. You can't expand
like I’ve been doing and not expect some trouble. And a lot
of my. relatives a-ren’t coming around much anymore and
this hurt business. They were pretty good spenders. I’m
not mad at anybody or blaming anyone. But it’s no fun.
I’ll tell you that.”

“What are you going to do, close down?”

“NO. THINGS are serious, but it’s not a catastrophe.
We’ll manage. We’ll just cut down on the unimportant
things, that’s. all. No more sweeping under the booths and
bar stools. No more changing burned out light bulbs. I ﬁg-
ure I’ll only wipe off the bar once a day and just keep the
neon light on for a couple of hours at night. And I won't
pay ole ‘Clem to shovel snow anymore. In time this ought to
set‘ me on .my feet again. Then I’ll start the annex again.
and__may_be hire back some of the help.” * » -'

—-“Is this gonna affect building your new garage?”

“No. Sue, and I already had money put aside for that.
There will be no problemthere. But We can’t start building
the outdoor barbecue like I’d planned. I’ll have to shelve
that.’3. ‘ . '

“How do you "ﬁgure you’ll get back on your feet, Joe ?”

“OH, ‘MY UN CLES and brothers _and I are having a.

meeting this week and we'll think of something. We’re al-
ready closed my alligator farm upstate because it’s obsolete.
But my cousin wants to ﬁnance -it for awhile so I suppose
I'll let him.” '

Hey, listen Joe. I’m sorry I got mad about the dirty
glass. I didn’t realize things were that bad.” _ - . ~.

“Oh that’s okay. Hey. How about taking your ‘f

Views on State Aid

Penn State May Lower Tuition Costs

(The following story is reprinted
from the September 28 issue of
The Daily Collegian, student
newspaper of Penn State. The
article, by reporter Joyce Mc-
Keever, highlights issues sur-
rounding state appropriations to
educational institutions such as
Penn State and Pitt).

Within the next few weeks
Penn State may be the only land-
grant university to make educa-
tional history by going back-
wards.

The tuition cut, provided in
both bills of the House of Rep-
resentatives and Senate, would
make Pennsylvania the only state
to reduce state university fees
for undergraduates while in other
states, oﬁicials are forced to
make a fee hike.

As both bills are pending in the
opposite committees of the House
and Senate, Congressmen in
Washington and leaders in near-
by states are eyeing its neighbor
with envy. ,

Most legislators in Harrisburg
and University officials, includ-
ing Edward E. Keller, vice-presi-
dent for public affairs, agree that
a bill cutting tuition will be pass-

ed before the end of this session.
Keller in an interview yesterday
seemed even more optimistic.

Last May when the House Com-
mittee on Higher Education quiz-
zed an army of University stu-
dents, faculty and administrators
in the Board Room of Old Main,
it seemed the University would
be lucky if it could get just what
it asked for.

What happened in the interim
to make Harrisburg go overboard
in its appropriations to Penn
State?

Basically it was the result of
a. slight oversight—a tax surplus
of about $35 million. In a bill
passed by the Senate, Gov. Wil-
liam Scranton earmarked 10 p_er
cent of the surplus to reduce
fees at the University.

However, the University ad-
ministrators also feel that some-
thing happened to change the
legislatdrs’ .attitude once they
completed their hearing in the
Board Room. As Keller pointed
out,"many of the legislators were
accustomed to metropolitan, uni-
versities. Many had never visited

The third annual Pitt October
Debates were held by the Wil-

day in the Cathedral from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m. with 14 schools
participating.

The 24 teams debated four

round each, each round" lasting
one hour. The issue was “Re-
solved: That law enforcement
agencies in the United States

should be given greater freedom,

in the investigation and prosecu-
tion of crime.”

the University Park campus. They
could not see, or adequately ap-
preciate, its problems.

But they’re out of the woods
now. There is a plan afoot to re-
duce fees to $115 per term at
Commonwealth Campuses, and
$140 at University Park. Keller
noted, that seems to be agreeable
to members of both House and
Senate.

Ironically, the question this
year is not a political one, but
which of the bills will ﬁnally be
enacted into law. Keller said he

. personally favors the House Bill

and would bet on a revised ver-
sion being passed.

Some flaws, however, still re- -
. main that might continue to press

the University. One is an amend-
ment to the House Bill, made by
James Gallagher (D.-Bucks) that
would triple the tuition for out-
of-state students.

The repercussions of the amend-
ment might be disasterous, Keller
said. He cited the U.S. Office of
Education “Report of Migration
of College Students,” which set
16,322 Pennsylvania residents en-
rolled in public institutions in
other states while only 4,687 non-
residents were enrolled in Penn-
sylvania’s public instructions.

Usually, as President Eric A.
Walker warned the Higher Edu.
cation Committee in May, any
tuition hike in one state would

be reciprocated by other states.
The results of such a hike
could bring almost 11,000 stu-
dents back to Pennsylvania. “We
would have to create another
University for them," Keller said.
Keller also cited the “squeeze”
(making a tuition cut at Univer-
sity Park and the Commonwealth
Campuses nearly identical) as
another “real problem.” The two
year extension center was design-
ed to save the student money by
living at home, he pointed out,
adding that a student at a Com-
monwealth Campus does not
have the same advantages as
students at University Park.

said. “Cummins helps us out by
analyzing the opposing defen-
sive ballplayers through the
ﬁlms.”

On many running plays, Qua-
ley must block a linebacker. The
Panthers have played against

three of the finest linebackers in,

the country. “I’d rate Casey of
Oregon as the toughest one to
play against,” he said. “Their
other linebacker, Tobey, wasn’t as
fast or as agressive.

“McAdams from Oklahoma,”
continued Qualey,_ “was the her-
alded defender. But he didn’t im-
press me that much, maybe be-
cause I managed to contain him
pretty well, especially on the
rush.”
~ Quarterback Kenny Lucas, be-
ing basically a drop-back passer,
depends a great deal on the cup
that forms in front of him on
pass. plays. Qualey enjoys the
pass blocking better than the
straight .ahead type of blocking.
“When it’s one on one,” he said,
“the challenge is there. The of-
fensive lineman picks out a de-
fensive man and makes sure that
that man doesn’t reach the pass-
er.”

Qualey and the other members
of the offensive line can now
tear up the pre-season reports

' that described their play .as weak

and uncertain. They’re a part of
one of the best Panther offenses
in the history of the school, aver.
aging 350 total yards per game.

it might become contagious, and
the rest of the team may think
positively about scoring,” Bemis
said.

 

Thus far most of the breaks have gone the other way.

“Remember to give our opposition a little credit too,” said de-
fensive coach John Steigman. “Just because several of their plays are
clicking it doesn’t mean that our tactics: are wrong.”

Steigman was referring to the accuracy of the down and out
passes of Duke’s Scotty Glacken. “That’s a tough pass to stop,” said
coach John Michelosen. “It’s the most effective pass form. Our strate-
gy called for letting up on the long passes and concentrating on stop-
ping the long ones. If we try to do both it would weaken the ground

defense.”

Such reasoning indicates that the present defensive personnel
isn’t equal to the task of working as an effective unit. The solution
of playing somebody like Crabtree both ways might help, but it would
give an opponent who is playing only one way the advantage. “It
would only work if that person is a superdooper athlete,” said Steig-

man.

“The necessity hasn’t materialized yet, but we're ready to if forced
into it,” said Michelosen. “After all We were in the same position last
year at this time using the old system.” ’

Dom Milillo Just

Wants To Finish
Out the Season

By GEORGE LIES

Coach Leo Bemis said this ’

year’s soccer team would
win if it played with a
team effort, but in the light
of team unity comes an in-
dividual. Dominico Milillo is
his name. . '

In every game this season, no
matter what the situation, Milillo
plays his type of game. “Every-
one else passes the ball, but Dom
is a dribbler,” said Bemis. “When-
ever he gets the ball, he keeps
it.”

Because Milillo plays a “keepsy”
game, he doesn’t start the game.
“Dom wants to play and this sea-
son he is hustling more, but Ferd
Sauer earned the starting posi-
tion over him because Sauer.is a
different kind of soccer player,”
Bemis said.

Sauer hustles enough to earn
his starting role, but Milillo ac-
cepts his own theory on why he
doesn't play as much as Sauer.
“I’m on his black list,” he said,
referring to Bemis.

Before the soccer team defeat-
ed Kent State last Saturday, the
hooters scrimmaged as they us-
ually do in practice, but Milillo
looked like a loner. In the scrim-
mage, he never -followed up the
offensive. plays. He never cut on
offense when his teammate had

the ball. He just waited for the

ball. He expected it.

“Milillo works well with one
man, but he has yet to learn to
think and play with a team.
Against Grove City, he worked
some pretty good give-and-go's
with Dave Shaffer, and once the
two combined for a score,” Be-
mis said.

DOM MILILLO shoots for goal in Kent game. Because he likes

to handle the ball, he doesn’t start.

“In that game, Dom did good,
but_ against an aggressive type of
ball team, he’s useless. They dou-
ble team him, and as one oppon-
ent attacks him from one side,
another steals away the"ball, said
Bemis.

 a player plays his
way, his. :mistakes stand out,
“Millio owns the bad, habit of

‘turning his back as hé's’-‘dribbling-a‘

toward the defensive man. He
does this on hiswpivot, and as he
pivots, his opponent can take the
ball from him,” said Bemis.

“In any game, the player who
plays on the offensive line has
to be a player who will face his
tacklers when he’s driving,” con-
tinued Bemis, “and during games,

Dom may fool, the opposition

once in a while, but as they catch
on, they steal the ball. In scrim-
mages, his teammates" know how
he plays, and Dom never looks
good.”

“Oh . . . I don't know . . . right
now I’ll play anywhere, even
goalie,” Millio said in his Italian
English. “This is my last year
and when the season started I
told myself I just would play out
the schedule and not open my

- month about anything.”

For the boy who was born in
the “heel” of Italy, this season
closes his soccer career. In ad-
mirationfor his professional soc-
cer-playing brother, Millo start-
ed his career as a youngster in
Italy, carried it to the United

States, and ended it here. Now _

it’s all over and Milillo is glad.

Frosh Coach Enthused
By Improving Booters

By ROY JACOBS

Sometimes a coach gains a faith in his team that ex-
tends a little farther than just confidence. This is the case
with freshman coach Bob McNulty.

“Our boys played a good game amidst some wild cir-
cumstances. Slippery Rock always has a large squad and
can substitute in gangs, taking advantage of a conditioning

edge. I’m proud of the way our
boys really hung in there.”

“We outplayed Slippery Rock,
and they knew it. We kept them
scrambling. Everyone we talked
to on their side agreed.”

The ﬁnal score of the game was
actually 1-1, including an over-
time period. Halfback and cap-
tain Dave Shimpeno scored Pitt"s
lone goal, while Slippery Rock
scored on a penalty kick. On the
other hand, the Panthers missed
a penalty kick and had the win-
ning kick in overtime nulliﬁed
by oﬁsides penalties.

“The defense, in my estimation,
did the better job,” explained the\
coach, who went on to single out
fu1lb.acks Dave Kozeil, Haldon
Schueler, and Mike Schalk, -and‘
goalie Dave Greenberg. “Don’t
forget Shimpeno, who besides
scoring the only goal, backed up.
and bolstered the defense.” Shim-.
peno is the only freshman booter
with a scholarship.

“The offense moved the ball
well and set up good plays, but at
times the out-thought them-
selves and moved out of position.”

This Saturday the team meets
the varsity of Fairmont State

The most effective way to evaluatea com-
pany in terms of its potential for dynamic
career growth is to examine its past rec-
ord, its current status, and its prospects
and planning for the future, together with
the professional climate it offers for the
development of your individual capabilities.

_ Boeing, which in .1966 completes 50 years

‘of unmatched aircraft innovation and pro-
duction, offers you career opportunities as
diverse as its extensive and varied back-
log. Whether your interests lie in the field
of commercial jet airliners of the future or
in space-flight technology, you can find at
Boeing an opening which combines profes-
sional challenge and long-range stability.

The men of Boeing are today pioneering
evolutionary advances in both civilian ‘and
military aircraft, as well as in space pro-
grams of such historic importance as
.America’s first moon landing. Missiles,‘
space vehicles, gas turbine engines, trans-

.- port helicopters, marine vehicles and basic _
research are other areas of Boeing activity.  .. - -

There’s a spot where your talents .can
mature ‘and grow at Boeing, in research,
design, test, manufacturing or administra- ,_
tion. The company’s position as world
leader in jet transportation provides a
measure of the calibre of people with
-whom you would work. In addition, Boeing
people work in small groups, where initia-
tive and ability get maximum exposure.
-Boeing encourages participation in the
company-paid Graduate Study Program at
leading colleges _and universities near
company installations.

We’re looking forward to meeting engi-
neering, mathematics and science seniors
and graduate students during our visit to
your campus. Makevanappointment now
