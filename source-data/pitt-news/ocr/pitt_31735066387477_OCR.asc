Philosophy tops

By Chih-Chen Yen _

For The Pitt News

The Greek philosopher
Aristotle would have been
proud. Despite a decline in in-
terest in the humanities since
the '70s, the philosophy
department at Pitt has
managed to survive and even
thrive.

Many people may not real-
ize it, but located in the

. Cathedral of Learning is one of '

the most distinguished depart-
ments at Pitt. The philosophy
department is recognized as
one of the most outstanding in
the country. As a matter of
fact, the department was
named the second best, be-
hind Princeton, ahead of Har- ’
yard, in a ranking chart by
Time magazine in 1983 and
has since topped charts and
surveys as one of the best
schools.
~ Dr. Joseph L. Camp, chair-
man of the department, said,
”The department was brought
to its present state by a group
of faculty who came to Pitt in

the early 1960s. They consist-
ed of Nicholas Rescher, who
is a university professor of
philosophy and present direc-
tor for the Center for
Philosophy of Science; Adolf
Gruenbaum, who is a Mellon
professor of philosophy; Kurt
Baier, distinguished professor
of philosophy, and Wilfred
Sellars, university professor of
philosophy. _

. ”They brought in several
other outstanding philo-
sophers over the. ensuing
years. At the same time, the
department recruited a large
number of very promising
junior faculty members who
were subsequently promoted
to tenure rank, ar/id the depart-
ment was gradually built up,”
said Camp.

Rescher and his colleagues
believed then that there was
still room in American
philosophy for another depart-
ment. They began with ‘a

. department for the philosophy

of science and gradually built
it up. J A '
The department sponsors a

t   P °tt
number of programs. A series
of lectures is conducted every
year at Pitt by leading
philosophers.

A large number of visiting
fellows come from all over the
world to give these lectures.
There are normally 10 to 20
lectures and conferences each
month. I

The presence of both the
philosophy department and
the department of history and
philosophy of science has
made Pitt an attractive place
for graduate students in the
department, the majority
working torward their Ph.D.

Virtually all the graduate stu-
dents come from out of state,
some as far as Australia.
”These students arevery gift-
ed. Entrance is extremely com-
petitive, and only 5 percent or
fewer are accepted,” said
Camp.

The graduate program at Pitt
is mainly geared torward
educating future professors.
Those receiving a Ph.D. from
the department have tradition-
ally gone on to become faculty.

Office within State
Department part of
covert ’propaganda’t

By Jim Drinkard

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —— An office
within the State Department en-
gaged in an illegal, covert ”w»hite
propaganda” effort to generate
support for the Reagan adminis-
tration’s policies in Central
America, according to congres-
sional investigators.

Since it was created in 1983,
the department's Office of Public
Diplomacy for Latin America and
the Caribbean at times arranged
news media interviews for lead-
ers of Nicaragua’s Contra rebels
and generated opinion articles
opposing Nicaragua’s leftist San-
dinista government for placement
in major media outlets, while
carefully concealing its own role
in the publicity effort, according
to investigators for the General
Accounting Office, Congress’ in-
vestigative arm.

For example, a March 11,
I985, opinion column in the
Wall Street /ournal on the offen-
sive threat posed by Soviet attack
helicopters in Nicaragua was at-
tributed to Rice University profes-
sor John F. Guilmartin Jr. GAO

Ku Klux Klan stages ,
demonstration near     

Lancaster

EPHRATA, Pa. (AP) - The Ku
Klux Klan will be back, a leader
of the white supremacist group
promised after a rally that brought
out many more opponents than
supporters and prompted the ar-
rests of six people.

Klan Imperial Wizard James W.
Farrands of Shelton, Conn., said
his group signed up 22 new
members after Klansmen burned
a 15-foot cross Saturday night in
rural Ephrata Township.

Some of the Ku Klux Klansmen
wore their traditional white hood-
ed garb. Others dressed in com-
bat fatigues. .

Police kept 300 people away,
including counter demontrators
and spectators. Six protesters
were arrested on disorderly con-
duct and other charges.

Later Saturday night, more than
.600 people turned out for an anti-

Klan rally in nearby Lancasterandﬁ
300 more dem0nstr@t¢d;i in 

 
  
 

said GuiImartin’s status as a paid .

consultant to the public diploma-
cy office and the office's collabo-
ration on the article apparently
were not disclosed to the
newspaper. . I
The GAO concluded that the
activities ”were misleading as to‘
their origin and reasonably con-
stituted ‘propaganda’ within the
common understanding of that
term” and violated a legal ban on
use of federal money for
propaganda not specifically
authorized by Congress.

In addition, the six—month‘

GAO investigation turned up

documents seen by investigators .  .
as relevant to Congress’ |ran- .- ‘

Contra probe but that were not
turned over by the White House
under a sweeping request for all
documents which could have a
bearing on the investigation.

’’It makes me wonder what else
is still being hidden from Con-
gress and the American people,”
said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,

chairman of the House Foreign .

Affairs Committee. Fascell re-

quested the GAO investiggationlg »

Despite the protests, Farrands

”Membership is ,going to be

Lithgow said he joined the KKK

recently and he and his son,ﬂ_S

to educate people about the new,

Before the rally began, pro-J

taunts outside Lithgow’s home. i

More aftershocks damage Los Angeles area

LOS ANGELES — A sharp after-
shock from last week's severe
earthquake jolted southern
California before dawn Sunday,
causing at least one death and
dozens of injuries, damaging
buildings, knocking out power
andsending jittery residents into
the streets.

The quake, centered in subur-
ban Rosemead about eight miles
northeast of downtown Los An-
geles, registered at 5.3 on the
Richter scale of ground motion,
said Don Kelly of the U.S. Geo-
logical Survey in Golden, Colo.

At the California Institute of
Technology the quake was meas-
ured at 5.5, according to a
spokesman, Robert Finn.

”|t wa_s pretty wild,” said Mark
Rosenker, who was on the 18th
floor of the Century Plaza Hotel
in Los Angeles. ”Let me tell you,
it does get you up."

The 3:59" a.m. quake was the

 22nd aftershock registering more

than 3.0 since Thursday's quake,
which measured 6.1 on the
-Richter scale and caused six
deaths and more than $75 mil-

Sunday's shock, centered
about two miles west of Thurs-
day's, was felt 40 miles west of
Los Angeles in Ventura County
and 100 miles south in San Die-
go. It was followed by three
tremors measuring 3.0 or more
within four hours. 

Power outages occurred in
numerous areas, and many resi-

gathered outside apartments and
houses, waiting for more shocks.
Others, camped out in a down-

been there since Thursday.

Bush gets praise from
Walesa on Europe trip

WASHINGTON — Polish
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
had just lavishly praised Vice
President Bush in Warsaw as a
man who "deserves to lead a

great nation,” when Bush was
asked how’ it felt to have the
equivalent of a campaign en-
dorsement from one of the
world's best known figures.

”The question is, how many
relatives does he have in Iowa?”
the vice president replied with
barely a pause. ”That’s the only
thing I want to know.”

Bush's jocular reference to the
state that will pick early delegates
to next year's Republican Nation-
al Convention demonstrated the
extent to which his official nine-
day visit to Europe Occurred
against a backdrop of domestic
politics.

Bush, who returned home On
Saturday, will meet with Presi-

dent Reagan to report on his trip

on Monday. He begins intensive
presidential campaigning on
Tuesday.

Already the front-runner in the
race, Bush will make a formal
declaration of his candidacy for
the 1988 Republican presidential
nomination on Oct. 12.

Bush insisted throughout that
the trip was an official one. and

FOXBORO, Mass. — New En-

deep Sunday, the earliest on
record for some places, and tem-

The heavy snow and wind

Comicbooks fun

In Europe and Japan, comic

reaching the United States. Some
of the most popular Japanese

comic books that are being trans-

Of course, who can forget V I

now is probably X-Man. It is
based on an international group

Eides sells about 3,000 comic
books per week, according to Jim

Operations Committee Chairman
Jack Brooks, D-Texas.

The public diplomacy office
was set up by the White House
in June 1983 to lobby Congress
for increased economic and mili-

’ tary aid in support of administra-

tion policies in Central America
and to head off ”crippling restric-
tions" on ‘such aid, according to
its first chief, political appointee
Otto J. Reich. Reich now is U.S.
ambassador to Venezuela.

The office has come under
previous criticism for its award-
ing of contracts to International
Business Communications, a
public relations firm that worked
closely with fired White House
aide Lt. Col. Oliver North on pri-
vate efforts to help the Contras.

|BC's president, Richard Miller,
along with conservative fund-

raiser Carl ”Spitz” Channell,

have pleaded guilty in the Iran-
Contra case_ to conspiracy to
defraud the government by ille-
gally using a tax-exempt founda-
tion to raise money for Contra
weapons.

Two days after the Wall Street
Journal opinion article appeared,

Johnathan S. Miller of the public '

diplomacy office sent a ”con-
fidential — eyes only” memoran-
~ dum to Patrick J. Buchanan, then
Reagan's director of communica-
tions, offering ”i|lustrative exam-

ples of the Reich ’White
Propaganda’ operation.”
In the memo, the office

claimed credit for the Cuilmartin
article in, the journal, noting that
its author ”has been a consultant
to our office and collaborated
with our staff in the writing of this
piece. It is devastating in its analy-
sis of the Nicaraguan arms build-
up. Officially, this office had no
role in its preparation.”

Larry Armour, a spokesman for
Dow Jones & Co., lnc., which
publishes the Wall Street Journal,
said Sunday that he was not
familiar with the Guilmartin
column. However, he noted that
the articles which run on the
newspaper's opinion page are
”opinion columns, and they
don't reflect Iournal policy?

Rally  

Continued from page 1

Klansmen yelled, ”KKK for
USA” and Farrands, speaking
through a bullhorn, told pro-
testers the Klan had a constitu-
tional right to hold a rally. A
contingent of state police and
police from seven municipalities,
some in riot gear, worked to con-
trol crowds.

Klansmen carrying a Confeder-
ate flag kept reporters about 50
yards from the rally site. They
later allowed reporters to watch
the cross-burning behind the
house.

’’I am a racist. I am proud of it,”
Farrands said to the. rallying
Klansmen. ’’I believe in the white
race. I am white. lam lily white."

Farrands and Klan leaders from

Pennsylvania and Maryland
decried blacks, homosexuals and

other groups in theirspeeches '

Saturday night. Farrands also op-
posed public programs such as
welfare, aid to dependent chil-
dren and student loans.

He claimed the Klan is ”the

‘ most powerful fraternal organiza-

S tion” and said it is the only group
”that fights for the rights of white
people.” 0

For the cross—lighting ritual,
robed Klansmen carrying torches

circled the 15-foot cross, which .

had been wrapped in burlap and

soaked with kerosene.
”Behold, the cross!” shouted a

Klansman. ”lt shall burn bright.

The cross is our inspiration, a .

symbol of faith, hope and love.”

After the rally, which ended
around 8:30 p.m., police began
urging the demonstrators to break
up. Police arrested one man who
tried to scuffle with Klansmen
leaving the cross-burning. Some-
one set fire to a Confederate flag
and threw it in the street.

Later that night, representatives
of more than 40 area civic groups
gathered at the two rallies in Lan-
caster and Ephrata, reading

proclamations against the Klan’

and holding candlelight vigils.

”This county stands for a whole
lot more than the Klan stands
for,” Louis A. Butcher, Jr., execu-
tive director of the Lancaster City-
County Human Relations Com-
mission told over 600 people

"-who huddled against the cold in
Lancaster_Square.

”We would like to laugh at the
Klan, as if it were a joke,” said
Barry Snowden, diretor of the
Lancaster County Council of
Churches. ”But there's a truly
tragic dimension to what is hap-
pening there — beside the fathers
and mothers at Klan rallies are
small children.” ‘

_’’l was a child of the 605,” said
Urban League board member
Deborah Davis. ”| protested in
the 60s, and we shouldn't have
to do it again. But if we must, we
will.”

At the Community Park of
Ephrata, nearly 500 people, car-
rying candles and singing songs,
gathered to promote unity and

peace.

Reporters were barred from the
president's speech ”because it
was a student assembly,”
McCummings' said. '

Student body president Steve
Edwards declined to comment on
the speech.

Computer center director Her-
bert Balian said Tuesday he and
the center's eight other em-
ployees were suspended when
they arrived for work. On Wed-
nesday, he said the center was
operating with all but one em-
ployee.

One suspension, he said, ap-
parently was ”still in the works.”

Cheyney, the nation's oldest
predominantly black college, re-
cently received re—accreditation
from the Middle States Associa-

tion of Schools and Colleges. The
association in 1985 pulled Chey-
ney’s accreditation, citing poor
fiscal management, weak aca-

demic programs and declining _

enrollment.

President McCummings, in a
statement Tuesday, said the com-
puter center’s nine employees
were sent home pending an in-

vestigation of ”improprieties in

the handling of student grades.”

Balian said the computer's
security system requires operators
to have operator and identifica-
tion numbers and a password,
and it restricts users from gaining
access to all information banks.

E. Sonny Harris, a math profes-
sor and president of the. faculty

-union, said he received 'a ”no-

details” briefing Tuesday on the
allegations.

Communication is
vital for partners
to succeed in -bed

Q: Why won’t my 42-year-old
/over have real sex with me? I am
a healthy 20-year-old woman,
and this puzzles me because we
do everything else — everything
that-I ever heard of, anyway. Is
it because I am still a virgin that
he is holding back on me? He

DR. RUTH
WESTHEIMER

 
seems to want me when we be-

gin; he gets erect right away and
keeps it a good long time, but
once he ejaculates, it doesn’t
come back. Is this because I am

not arousing him right? Is that all,

he is capable ofphysically, or am
I doing something wrong?

A: Your last question in that ser-
ies of questions is one that I hear
often — and the answer is not to
get it stuck iniyour head that
you're not exciting, that you are
doing something wrong, that it is
your fault when he does not act
the way you want him to act in
bed. People, both women and
men, are far too prone to decid-
ing that sexually they are in the
wrong.

If he won’t have intercourse
with you, if he gets erect one time
on a date and that's all you get,
then it is good-natured of you not
to blame him right away but
wrong to ‘ blame yourself.
Lovemaking is a cooperative ac-
tivity, and when a partner is'dis-
satisfied, it means that both
partners need to communicate
better about what is missing. Both
partners have to be responsible
for being stimulating and for
learning what the other one
wants. .

I can't tell by your letter
whether ”that’s all he is capable
of,” and I couldn't if you both
were in my office because assess-
ing physical capacity is not my
job. I don't know how to do it.
If there is a question of a man's
being limited physically as a

lover, he should go to a urologist.

for a checkup. I often send men
to urologists, women to gynecol-
ogists, before beginning sex ther-
apy because we all can use the
information a medical specialist

can supply. The specialists can

reassure us that nothing is amiss
physically,_ and that puts every-
one in a positive frame of mind.

I don't know that this is the
case with your 42-year-old, but
older men ordinarily have longer
refractory periods than young
men -— that is, they need longer
to recover from an orgasm before
they can have another erection.
This‘ does not mean they are
finished as lovers. But when this
is the case, you may be the most
sexually skillful and experienced
woman in the world and still
couldn't hurry him up to get
ready for another round of sex.

It is not only older men who
have longer rest periods between
erections. Among young men,
the length of the refractory peri-
od varies widely, and this does

not mean there is anything wrong ’

with the young guy who comes
back more slowly. It is simply an
individual characteristic, like the
color of his hair and eyes, the size
and shape of his ears.

Why won't he have intercourse

.with you? Possibly, he does not

want to be responsible for taking
away your virginity. It may very
well seem to him that having in-
tercourse with you would com-
mit him more than he wants to be
committed. The way things are
now, he can have fun with alive-
ly attractive young woman and
still back away pretty easily when
and if-you begin to think and talk
about the big M — marriage.

I suggest strongly you leave this
42-year-old behind you right
away. Not because he is older
but because he lacks commit-
ment to you. At 20, you have ev-
ery right to ask more of a man
than this one is willing to give to
you.

BETWEEN THE LINES
 

Call it one of those bizarre oc-
casions when life turns the tables

- and becomes a mirror of art — or

the mirror of TV, at least. Sonny
Crockett, beware.

Last week, the first 100
concealed-weapon permits rolled
off the presses in Florida under a
new state law allowing most
Floridians to openly‘ carry
sidearms.

Step right up folks, do—it—
yourself, Miami Vice bad-ass kits
are now available for the asking,
officially sanctioned by those
who love you most, your state
legislators.

Now the kicker: The new law
managed to drop an ’fopen car-
ry" provision from the old restric-
tions on gun permits which, in
the past, had prevented people
from wearing guns in plain view.

At the outset, to the average,
law-abiding Floridian, the new

law means losing peace of mind. .

But in the long run, the state, as
a whole, will no doubt pay a
stiffer price — in both money and

 lives.

Personally,‘ I think Florida's
state legislature is about due for
some psychiatric counseling.

Imagine being a clerk at an all-

If  ‘ night service station under these

   

new conditions. Or how about a
conveniece store cashier? How
would you feel if a person walked
in with a .38-caliber _revolver
tucked under his belt, moved
briskly toward you and asked
with a grin, ”Where do you keep
the Rolaids?” A little nervous,
perhaps?

What if you worked the coun-
ter in a jewelry store? What
would you be required to say?
”Yes sir, that's a real diamond, all
right — one of the hardest sub-
stances known to man. Go
ahead, take a whack at it with the
butt of your pistol. I guarantee
you won't break it.” Something
like that?

According to wire service
reports, situations have already
begun to occur. 1

Last week, Associated Press
reported that, in Tampa, at one
minute after midnight the day the
new law went into effect, police
were alerted to a possible rob-
bery in progress at a drug store.

When police arrived, they
found a man with a .45-caliber
automatic tucked into his
trousers. ‘ .

Police spokesperson Steve
Cole told AP that the man had
heard about the new gun law
and, since it was after midnight,
decided to ”take his gun shop-
ping with him.” He was asked to
put the gun in his car because it
made people a bit uneasy. He did
so without incident.

I doubt, however, that many
Floridians want to gamble that
such situations will always go
without incident. Bet on this: De-
bate is going to escalate.

Will merchants have the right
to refuse entry or refuse to do
business with an individual who
openly carries a sidearm? Under
the new law, if a gun-bearing cus-

tomer refuses to leave when.

asked to do so, he can be arrest-
ed for trespassing. But if the per-
son is causing no trouble, isn't
this a form of discrimination?

The new law was passed in
April after lobbying by the Na-
tional Rifle Association eased res-
trictions on gun permits, allowing
anyone to ” carry a concealed
weapon unless they are convict-
ed felons or areincapacitated. Is
this stipulation supposed to help
Floridians breathe a sigh of relief?

Habitual felons will carry side-
arms if they want to, new law or
not. And I've never really worried
about being threatened or at-
tacked by incapacitated individu-
als. Personally, I’m a little more
concerned about the robust, hot-
headed types.

Authorities predict 60,000
Floridians will eventually be li-
cenced to openly carry sidearms.
Approximately 1,800 applica-
tions for concealed weapons per-
mits have been arriving at the
Secretary of State's office in Tal-
lahassee peryday. As of last Tues-

The paper and your money, please

day, 32,444 people had
requested permit packets. About
3,700 applications have been
returned completed. .

I never really liked Florida to
begin with. I’ts always seemed
sort of culturally vacuous and
uni—dimensional. There's sand.
There's water. And that's about it.
But now, add danger to the list.

I'm interested to see how this
new law will affect law enforce-
ment in Florida. Worried police
departments have already issued
special warnings for officers to
use ”a degree of caution” in mak-
ing what used to be routine traffic
stops.

I'm also interested to see how
the new law will affect tourism in
the state. Look at it this way, lots
of places have nice beaches. And
I'd be willing to bet that many
people will seek alternatives to
Florida this year when vacation
time rolls around. I know I will.

Who are you going to trust now?

TIM
VAN GELDER

With all the talk of arms con-
trol these days, the old question
automatically arises —- can we
trust the Russians? Some people
have a gut reaction about this;
they say things like ”the Soviets
are just expansionistic dictators,
so of course they can't be trust-
ed.” Seriously! Invfact, I've heard
even stupider things from time to
time. But: enough listening to
people who let their guts do the
thinking.

There are a number of ways we
could try and work out whether
the Russians can be trusted. For
one thing, we could listen to
what they say — which of course
is not very smart, but then you'd
be surprised how many people
turn around and trust wily
weasels _like Weinberger and
Reagan. .

Better, we could take a good
look at the history of compliance

The time

That morning, I told her some-
thing was wrong with me. I didn't
feel muchlike doing anything,
and the price of gold was too
high. I wanted to buy something
to .make her love me, but I
couldn't afford anything.

I had always been told that the
path to the heart was through the
mind, not the stomach as some
insist. My experience points to a
refracted detour through the in-
side of a diamond. You can't buy

-love, but you can attract it with

shiny things, like a black crow.

When I was a little kid, I
remember liking the fall best. I
could stand on the hill behind my
house and pretend I was stronger

with arms control agreements, or
indeed treaties of any kind. Now
if we do that, the Soviets don't ex-
actly come out with a clean slate,
to be sure — but then neither do-
we, and presumably we can be
trusted. So not much can be
learned that way either.
Another way we might do it is
by looking at their domestic poli-
cies, trying to infer how they
might behave I internationally.
Surely tyrannical dictators at
home must be shameless oppor-
tunists abroad? Unfortunately, the
more you look at it, the more the
a priori link between behavior at
home and behavior at large
breaks down. Take the French,
for example —— all liberty, frater-
nity and equality at home, but
very nasty to foreigners — just ask

anybody In the South Pacific. Or,

take the Chinese — ruthless, com-
munists at home, but they pretty
much stop at their own borders.

Finally, we could try and assess
their national character. Now,
that's pretty hard if, like most of
us, you don't know too many
Russians. But there are ways. We

could learn something about their
history and culture, for example.
There's a lot of ground to be
made up here. According to a
New York Times poll, 43 percent
of Americans still believe that the
Soviets fought with the Nazis in
World War II. Obviously, every
little bit is going to help.

Take Marx, for example, histo-
ry’s most abused and misquoted
thinker. Few people realize that
atone stage, he believed that in
a communist state, the law itself
will ”wither away” and die, that
a coercive legal order is only a
bourgeois capitalist invention

"needed for the oppression of the

working classes.

How could Marx possibly have
believed such a crazy thing?
Well, it was a common enough
idea at the time, especially in
Russian intellectual circles. The
19th century Czarist government
was at times actually trying to in-
troduce some Western-type con-
stitutional reforms but met
resistance from the radical intel-
ligentsia, who thought that the

need for a unified legal order was

quite un—Russian. Their society,

they thought, operated on moral-

ly superior patriarchal bonds of

trust and love, not coercive legal

structures. In fact, they looked on .
the very idea of Western-type

constitutional reform as un-

patriotic,

Of course, Soviet society has
undergone great changes since
those days, but you can't eradi-
cate such deep traits of national
character overnight. If there real-
ly is such a thing as a national
character, it seems that operating
on the basis of trust is a pretty im-
portant part of Russian society.

All this, of course, by no me-
ans guarantees Soviet compli-
ance with the pending missile
reductions. But it does suggest
that we shouldn't simply assume
that they can't be taken at their
word. Cheating on an arms con-
trol agreement is certainly possi-
ble, but very un—Russian.

the necessity for it. Things don't

anything usually isn't better, that
things get worse. That with

Steeler players hold strike rall

By Eric- Poole
Staff Writer

When rich people want something,
they peel some bills off their roll.
When an athlete wants more, he has
to peel it off his hide — a very expen-
sive price. Does he deserve a reward
for that sacrifice? That price? Or is the
pain its own reward?

The Franchise, Peter Gent

In The Franchise, Peter Gent's
follow-up novel to North Dallas
Forty, Taylor Rusk, ”The greatest
quarterback ever to come out of
Texas,” argues in the passage above
that professional football players are
entitled to the same rights as the
general populace.

Rights such as freedom of move-
ment, the right to privacy, job secu-

rity and a pension plan.

In real life, the NFL Players Associ-
ation is fighting for these rights for its
membership. However, the public
seems intent on denying profession-
al football players the same rights that
they themselves enjoy. A

The Pittsburgh Steelers’ player

rrepresentative, Tunch llkin, believes
that that can be attributed to the
league.

”The NFL has the best P.R.
machine in the world,” said llkin.
”They give the press transportation,‘
free meals, access, stories. Who do
you think the press is going to side
with?”

llkin brought up a quote from Tex
Schramm, the general manager of the
Dallas Cowboys, which could be
taken as a veil_ed threat against the

press, ”Theplayers are only transient ers] are such good friends,” said

workers.”

”The press isn't telling the whole
story,” said offensive tackle Mark
Behning. ”Gene [Upshaw, the direc-
tor of the NFLPA] is talking about all
of the issues, but the only thing you
see in the press is free agency.”

Gent, a former wide receiver for
the Cowboys, contends that the own-
ers see the players merely as cattle
that can be replaced.

The owners seem to have proven
their point by playing out the sched-
ule with scab games.

This has caused many players, such
as the Steelers’ Mike Webster and
Earnest Jackson, to return to the scab
teams to play in the games.

”The worst part about it is that it
hurts because they [the strike break-

guard Craig Wolfley.

Behning contends that there will be
some animosity between the strike
breakers and those who stayed on
strike, partially because he feels that
the owners are trying to break the
union.

”Definitely the owners are trying
to break the union through the strike
games. If the owners wanted to fix the
problems, they would be at the
negotiating table.’’

llkin disagreed that the owners are
trying to break the union. ”They.,are
trying to rubber—stamp the union,” he
expJained.

But Ilkin does agree that the own-
ers should be at the bargaining table.
”If the owners were sincere about
ending the strike, they would be at

the table.”

In 1987, Tunch llkin is an NFLPA
leader. In 1982, the date of the first
strike, he was a third-year player, a
marginal prospect. ‘

The players who will lead the. Play-
ers Union into the 19905 are margi-
nal prospects now. What will stop
them from crossing the picket lines
now -— fear of losing their jobs? If the
borderline players cross, it could
decimate the union membership for
a long time, possibly permanently.

What will the Tunch llkins of the
19905 do in the coming weeks if the
strike lasts that long?

”[The defection of Webster and
Jackson] seems to have strengthened
our resolve, even that of the younger
players. It has unified the rest of us,”
said llkin. ’

Eagles zero in on Panthers, win 13-10

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

The easy thing to do at this
point would be to yell and
scream and pout and call for the
coach.’s head and just give up on
the Pitt football team as a whole,
at least in 1987 terms.

Ten points scored. Thirteen
points allowed. Pitt's second dis-
appointing loss in three weeks.
There are always televised col-
legiate games and strikebreaker
football, you know, the -USNFL
on NBC and CBS, to keep foot-
ball fans in the this area enter-
tained. V

Well, what the Panthers’ Satur-
day night loss actually should
mean to the Blue and Gold faith-
ful is a re—examining of expecta-
tions, maybe lowering the ceiling
on what second-year head coach
Mike Gottfried’s final product
should be. Maybe this team, sor-
ry to say, just isn't as good as
everyone thought. No, it's not
”maybe" anymore. It's fact.

Marks in the loss column back

that up.

The puzzling question remains:
Where is the Panthers’ offense?
One thing for sure, it wasn't at Pitt
Stadium trying to score points
through the Boston “College
defense. But then again, the scary

“side of all this, is that maybe it

really was.

Kickball

By Sam Tallarico
Assistant Sports Editor

0 Saturday night's loss against
Boston College was not a pretty
sight. The defense performed ad-
mirably, but the offense hasn't
been pulling its -weight. This
game disproved the theory that
defense wins football games.

Quarterback Sal Genilla com-
pleted 12 of his 23 passes for only
127 yards and four interceptions,
three which occurred in the first
quarter. Hissecond interception
was deflected, the third one was
tipped. In the early going, this

game showed signs ofithe Steel- _

”Offensively, I'm not doing a
very good job of coaching right

now. It’s very frustrating. The _

play-calling, the decisions -
that’s my area. I can't really
blame the players, although I
can’t_remember ever seeing a
worse collection of mistakes by
a football team.”

The Panthers’ first possession
was the bleakly ominous omen of

what was to come. Panther quar—u

terback Sal Genilla’s (12-23, 127
. yards, 4 int.) first pass was tipped
at the line by BC linebacker Matt
Kelly and intercepted by a left
tackle named Mark Murphy.
Three minutes later, an Eagle field
goal attempt sailed through the

uprights, and the visitors led 3-0.-

Just like the TV commercial
that offers the package of the
inside-the-egg egg-scrambler, the
Ginsu knife collection'(comp|ete
with ancient Japanese Ginsu
chef), the Pocket Fisherman and
the engraved, simulated-platinum
kitchen utensils — ”But that's not
all!” Pitt's second possession
went something like this: A quick
two-yard carry by tailback Craig
Heyward, a fumbled snap by
quarterback Sal Genilla which
resulted in four yard loss, then a
Genilla pass which was tipped at
the line andpicked off by Eagle
cornerback Vincent Munn. BC
booted another field goal, and
before you could say ”$19.95,”
Pitt trailed by six.

Genilla blamed only himself for
his misfortunes. ‘

”You have to fight through ad-
versity,” said Genilla. ”In the se-
cond quarter, there" were no
faults. The first two interceptions
were my fault.”

0 The Panthers installed a new
style of play. Let Temple head
coach Bruce Arians keep his
”bashball,” because Pitt has

In the second quarter, Genilla
pitched the ball to Louis Riddick,
who tried to pitch it to Craig Hey-

Riddick

By Vince Carey

Staff Writer

Until last week, Pitt’s»Louis Rid-
dick was an up-and-coming
defensive back. Now he is the
newest attack in the Pitt offensive
scheme. In Saturday's 13-10 loss
to Boston College, Louis carried
the ball 11 times for 54 yards.

”! just do wha ver is best for
the team,” said Riddick. ’’If it's at
running back, than that's where
I'll stay.” «

Riddick grew up in Quaker-
town, Pa., and graduated from
Pennridge High School. During
his high school career, Louis
played most of the time on
defense, but still managed to gain
960 yards on the ground in his
senior year.

Riddick came to Pitt as a free
safety, but may have found a per-
manent place in the Panther
backfield.

”Louis gives us an extra dimen-

sion to go along with Craig [Hey-

ward],” said Pitt head coach
Mike Gottfried. ’’I think he
played well enough to merit
more time there.”

Riddick also received praise
from BC coach Jack Bicknel.
”He’s_ the kind of runner that has
the combination of speed and
quickness. It makes it incredibly
tough on the defense. They can't
follow his flow.”

regains his running style of

The best part of Riddick’s play
is that with him in the backfield,
the defense can't key on Hey-
ward all of the time. This can
keep the defense ‘guessing, and
give Pitt a better opportunity to
move the ball.

”Lou did as well, if not better,
than I expected,” said Heyward.
”He really helped me out during
the game. His rushes kept me
fresh. They also had to change
their defense away from me, so
I didn't have as many people on
me when I carried the ball.”

Off the field, Riddick is a very
good student. He scored 1,100
on the_SAT, and is in the running
to be" a'R'h'oc'les Scholar.

On the field he still sees a good
makeup of the team. ”We had
some mental errors throughout
the game, and it cost us. We'll
just have to fix them in practice.

”As far as this game is con-
cerned, I'm not satisfied because
we didn't win. You could run for
200 yards in a game, but if you
don't win, it" doesn't really
matter.” .

The past week in practice, Rid-
dick practiced with the running
backs, but didn’t know if he'd see
much playing time there.

”During practice I practiced on
carrying the ball, but I was kind

of surprised that I was used so .

New Steelers keep

first-place status  

By Ed Shearer

AP Sports Writer

ATLANTA —— The smallest Oc-
tober crowd in Atlanta Falcons
history, 16,667, watched the
Pittsburgh Steelers win a battle of
NFL replacement teams 28-12
Sunday as quarterback Steve
Bono accounted for two
touchdowns.

Fans inside the stadium only
outnumbered union pickets out-

' side the stadium by 1-7-1. There

were 25,960 tickets sold, and a
crowd of over 40,000 would
have been expected had the regu-
lar Falcons not been on strike.

Mike Kenn, an NFL Players As-
sociation vice president, thanked
the 1,000 pickets for helping
keep nearly 30,000 fans who had
purchased tickets away from the
game. .

There was virtually no trouble
outside the stadium before the
game, with only one minor inci-
dent reported, and it did not in-
volve the players or other unions
helping them picket the game.

There were signs of support for
the replacement olavers scattered
around the stadium.

One said ”Fans for Falcons
Whoever ’They’ Are.”

There was another that said

”Support your local scabs” and.

another that said ”How ’bout
them scabs.” .

The small crowd generally sup-
ported the Falcons, although they
did begin booing in the fourth
quarter when it became apparent
Pittsburgh would win.

The outcome left Pittsburgh
with a 2-1, record and Atlanta
with a 1-2 mark. The NFL has

said the games will count in the ,

standings.
Bono, who completed 12.of 22

passes for 164 yards, scored on ’

a 1-yard sneak and threw _a 5-yard
pass 1 to Russell
another score.

Backup Reggie Collier hitloey .

Clinkscales with an 11-yard scor-

ing. pass, and the other Pittsburgh . ’

score came on a 1—yard run by

Earnest Jackson, a two-time. Pro.

Bowler who crossed the picket
line to join the replacement team.

Atlanta's scoring came on a
27-yard field goal by Greg Davis
and a safety when Bono, a form-
er UCLA quarterback, was called
for intentionally grounding a pass
from the end zone.

The Falcons scored a touch-
down with 1:57_left on Jeff Van
Raaphorst’s 19-yard pass to Mil-
ton Barney. '

what is best for the team. l’ll play

As of now, Pitt may be able to

take some of the pressure to car-
ry the Panther offense off of the
shoulders of Heyward. This
week, Louis Riddick was the an-
swer, and he looked as if he
could be around for a while.

”|,’m pretty sure that I'll be at
running back for the rest of the
season,” said _Riddick.- ’’I like run-

Game

Continued from page 11

”UnbelievabIe,” mumbled
Gottfried on the slew of his
team's fo_uI—ups.

That was the highlights, and
lowlights, of the first quarter. Both
teamsran the football and played
stingy defense in an all-out effort
to give the crowd of 46,000 some
siesta time. Doug Flutie, the
legendary miracle-working quar-
terback of the Eagles who was in
attendance to watch his brother
Darren play, had to be rolling in
his seat due to the lack of big—p|ay
offense. J I

But when you look back, the
Panther defense was nothing

‘ short of outstanding in that first

half. ”I was proud of the way our

  

This is rock ’n’ roll.

defense played,” said Gottfried.
”We played well enough on that
side of the ball to win.”

Boston College quarterback
Mike Power was sent scrambling
for his life out of the pocket —
that is, when Pitt's pass rusher
extraordinaire, Zeke Gadson,
didn’t grab hold of him and slap
him to the turf. The senior from
Frogmore, S.C., tallied a whop-
ping 5‘/2 sacks and 1 1 tackles and
did all sorts of mean things to the
BC backfield. Linebacker James
Turner had 12 tackles. A great
defensive effort yielded only 116
Eagle yards in the first half.

Starting at their own 42, (Semi-
la and company pieced together
10 straight runs which ended in

‘ 

Offensively, I’m not
doing a very good job
of coaching right now.
It's very frustrating.

— Mike Gottfried

a 2—yard shot up the middle by
Heyward. Impressive, down-
you r-th roat football for a 7-6 lead.
And with that drive, the Panther
offense seemed to make a
statement.

Come the third quarter, that
statement was ”Adios,

muchachos.” An interesting stat:
Pitt held the ball for 11‘/2 minutes
and had zero points to show for
it. Kicker Jeff VanHorne, who
booted a bit like his name was
Jeff VanBrasco, blew two field
goal attempts, one from 50 yards,
and one from 36. Genilla went
3-8, badly missing receivers on
several occasions. ”Things go
right sometimes, things go bad
sometimes,” said Genilla. ’’I’m
doing the best I can.”

Pitt again regained possession
early in the final period, this time
at midfield. A 19-yard toss from
Genilla to receiver Reggie Wil-
liams set up a VanHorne FC with
12:37 to play.

Pitt saw the ball for only six

more plays and went nowhere.

Boston College, behind an im-
pressive effort by tailback Jim
Bell, who had 139 yards on the
night, suddenly solved Pitt's
defensive puzzle. The Eagles ran
off 10 plays, then at the Pitt one,
a masterful fake—dive by Bell

‘duped enough Panther defenders

for Power to bootleg into the left
side of the end zone. 13-10. A
Genilla interception. End of
game. What's wrong with Pitt?

”Believe me, we practiced
hard for this game,” stressed Pitt
wide receiver Billy Osborne. We
knew BC was going to be the best
team we'd faced so far this sea-
son. But something just isn't
right.”
