Monthly lndex

Shows Decline

Business conditions in Pitts-
burgh, after having risen steadily
since April to a new high in Au-
gust, slumped during the month of
September, according to the Pitts-
burgh Business Review, a monthly
summary of Pittsburgh business
published by the Bureau of Busi-
ness Research.

Factors responsible for
down-trend, according to the Bu-
reau, are shortage of coal and
coke, due to captive mine shut-
down, lack of steel scrap, numer-
ous labor disputes, and open-
hearth repairs.

Along with gains in employ-
ment and the decline in Pittsburgh
payrolls came an ever-gaining rise
in the cost of living, both for this
district and for the nation. Large
relative gains were conﬁrmed in
the prices of food, clothing, house
furnishings, rent, fuel, and light.

Tait Announces New

SPA Morale Drive

Ed Tait, C42, vice-president of Student-faculty association,
today‘ announced plans for a “gigantic” student-soldier letter
writing day next Wednesday. November 12. _

Tait and Mary Bowen, C43, co-chairmen of the commit-

tee, called on all students and
faculty to “Spread cheer in
camp with a three - cent
stamp,” in the ﬁrst effort of the
newly-organized United Student
committee to raise the morale of
former Pitt men now in the armed
service.

Colonel Edward L. Kelly,’ profes-
sor of military science and tactics,
said that the letter-writing drive
was one of the ﬁnest and easiest
ways possible for‘ raising the
morale of the US~army.

Theodore‘ w. Biddle. acting

dean of men, said, “I canthink of
no better way to spend a- few mo-

1 ments of one’s time. I personally
shall help by writing my own
letter."

Tait outlinednthe aim of the pro- _

gram when he said that itvwas the

. purpose of the committee‘ to create

such stud.ent_in;terest in the. SFA-
sponsored drive that everyone in

the University, students and-‘: facul-

ty alike, would write at least one

' letter to a friend or to a-friend's

friend in camp. .
As an incentiveto the coopera-
-tion. of student and faculty, , Tait
announced ‘ that V: next‘ Nlonday
“reams of stationery". ‘I would be
placed in’ strategic parts of the
.Cathedral. V " ‘

Complete addresses of all sol-
diers will be provided by the com-
mittee and will be posted on all
bulletin boards in the Cathedral.

Tait suggested that 15 to 20
minutes of Armistice day, a stu-
dent holiday, be spent to write the
letters. A

He asked all fraternity men to
write to drafted brothers and ask-
‘ed pledge captains to use their
groups as aides in the capaign,
suggesting that each pledge write
one or two letters.

The word democracy implies that
each member of a community, con-
 tribute his share ofknowledge and
' . skill to some abstract totalityplike
‘ the community or ‘state. The uni-
versity, long a center of rugged in-
dividualism, is beginning to re-
r ‘evaluate its theory in terms of the
co'ncept——democracy.

   
   
   
  
        
   
  
     
   
  
  
   
     
   
      
  
   
    
  
    
   
  
  
    
   
     
   
  
   
      
    
    
  
 
    
  
     
   
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
   
    
  
    
 
  
  
 
    
   
   
   
    
   
   
 
  
  
  

The university of the future will
differ radically from the university
of today. It will serve its com-
munity to the best of its ability,
with humility rather than dogma-
tism. Adult education courses,
coursesfor the especially talented
and gifted, creative rather than
formalized courses in the arts:
these will be part of the university
of the future.

» Already within the university the
~ concept of democracy is being put
into practice. While formerly each
 department of the university was
isolated from other departments,
. the new trend in education is to-
ward correlation of departments.

Gas is the one obvious weapon
not yet used in ‘the second World
*l,War. Yet gas——along with tanks
:and ‘ airplanes---are the three’
 weapons Captain Liddcll-Hart con-
siders the backbone ‘ of the mili-
" tary machine of today. Ex—B1-itish
T. general staff and ‘London “Tele-
 fgraph” analyst Liddell-Hart has

: concisely summarized ‘the technics
. and objectives of World War II
by in a small, 15,000-word book call-
‘. {ed “The Future of War.”

The theory of army general
staffs from the time of’ Napoleon
to 1918 was that _wnrs— would
he fought by nations in arms:
total war in which the main
objective would be the destruction
of the enemy's armed forces. This
doctrine Liddell-Hart denies, and
his contention seems to have been
borne out by German war plans
during 1936-1941.

Liddell-Hart based his book on
: the idea that “the ultimate peace
.will be the guiding star of the

College students have, within the
past six months, become more
acutely aware of World War II
and its consequences. Last sem-
ester there was only general
apathy when the war was mention-
ed among college students. This
semester some quite lively discus-
sions have been overheard-even
in the Tuck Shop.

All this is an introduction to a
new book, “The Alternative," es-
pecially written for college stu-
dents who want an answer to the
question, “What part shall Amer-h
ica take in the present war?" By
using the fall of France as a point
of‘ departure, Leon Cotnareanuy
former editor of “Figaro,” inﬂu-
ential Paris newspaper, concludes
that, unless America is willing to
pay the price of war, it must face
oblivion and domination by Hitler.

The book is published by Dodda
Mead and sells for $1.50. Its vir-
tues are clear and concise answers

away from the blatant hysteria
found so frequently in books of
I this sort. It is slanted toward the

g  D. few ' tellectuals

to speciﬁc questions and’ a shying-e

large body of college students, '

Here at the University of Pitts-

burgh we have an excellent ex-
ample of this. The English depart-
ment, under the direction of Pro-
fessor Frederick P. Mayer, is work-
ing with the idea of correlating
work done in English literature
classes with other departments.
Tentative plans have been made to
tieup English with music, ﬁne
arts, speech, and the library.

The library had been consider-
ed, until the past few years, a sep-
arate branch of the University.
With the new plan of the Eng-
lish department, it becomes a vi-
tal and organic part of the stu-
dent’: education in English.

In "the Freshman Reading room,
for example, a well-chosen collec-
tion of novels, -plays, essays, and
poetry has been arranged for
freshman browsing. Freshmen are
required ‘to read in the Reading
room in connection with their Eng-
lish courses. It is hoped that in
this way students will develop a
reading habit, and that this habit

military policy,” that a.‘nation’s
weapons in wartime should be di-

rected against its enemy’s “nerve
centers and arteries of civil life,”
that the paralysis of the enemy's
will to ﬁght-.--not the destruction
of his armies——was the main, the
only» objective. This would scrap
the 1914 war-of-attrition idea, for

even when that method succeeded,

the victorious nations themselves
were exhausted-——c.f. . France and
England ‘in 1919.

The new warfare—-the warfare
of 193634-1-then, was to “strike
a single decisive blow_as easily as
possible against some vital point
which will instantly paralyse the
enemy's resistance."

This new idea, Liddell-Hart
points out, was discovered by the
British Tank corps general staff
during the summer of 1918: “a
scheme was evolved to launch a
ﬂeet of light fast tanks, under the
cover of a general offensive, which
would pass through the German
lines, and neglecting the ﬁghting
troops, aim straight for the com-

again the argument that Cots-

reanu states.

>3 is *

A recent article on “What_
Draftees Are Reading” in the Sat-
urday Review of Literature reveals
that the most called for book in
army camp libraries is “For Whom
the Bell Tolls," with “Oliver Wis-
well" running a close second. This
is amazing when compared to the
favorite book during the last war,
“Tarzan.”

And it is a fine thing, too. For

the draftee who reads a book of the
caliber of “For Whom The Bell

. Tolls” is much healthier, mentally,

than the draftee who read “Tar-
zan.” “Tarzan” is escapism; “For
Whom The Bell Tolls” is an at-
tempt to ﬁnd a faith to live for by
one of the great prose masters of

_ -our time.

Culture - minded Pittsburghers
can settle down to a fine winter.
The Nixon is going full blast with
its best season in a long time; the
Pittsburgh Symphony has hit its
stride and is going high, wide, and
handsome; the visiting orchestra
list is very pr;omising——last Friday
night's Philadelphia orchestra was

will make students more alert and
intellectually aware of the things
that are happening around them.

The Alldred room is the brows-
ing room for upperclassmen. Hav-

ing more or less “graduated” from A

the Freshman Reading room, stu-
dents will  expected -to spend
more time browsing‘ in the larger
Alldred room collection. Under
an honors system, also tentative,
students need not go to their class-
es, but may spend -part of their
class time in the Alldred room.

Then, there is the Reserve Book
room. All books dealing with Eng-
lish literature, under the new plan,
will be grouped together. This
should stimulate interest in back-
ground material for literature
courses.

(This is the first in a series ‘of
articles dealing with the correla-
tive experiment in the English de-
partment. Later‘ articles will dis-
cuss the correlation of English
with the phonograph and fine’
arts.)

mand and communication centers
in ‘the rear of the front. By the
annihilation of these, the disor-
ganization and capitulation of the
combatant units was visualized
. . . this plan was adapted as the
basic tactical idea for 1919.”

But it wasn't needed that long.
Germany's General Ludendorf said
in his memoirs: “August 8, 1919,
was the black day of the German
army in the history of the war . ..
mass attacks by tanks . . . became
our most dangerous enemy.”

The Allies dropped this doctrine
after the war; but the Germans
developed it in every respect ex-
Liddell-Hart
marks Germany as the natural
power to develop gas warfare be-
cause of its great chemical indus-
tries. .

But aside from slight Russian
reports . of captured plans, and
statistics of excessive arsenic im-

ports ‘into’ Germany since 1935,
there is no indication that the

* Nazis plan to use gas. It seems

even they have not devised suffi-
cient defenses against it, although
Liddell-Hart claimed its use would
eliminate the defenseless‘ infantry,
and promote the airplane and
sealed tank as the only two weap-
ons of the war.

You may say this doctrine has
become well-known in this country
since 1940; you may also say this
doctrine may not be true, since a
reported 6 million men have been
in action in Russia. But the point
of this comment is to remind you
that the core of this war is the
tank and plane, and not men.

The infantry in the Russian war
can be explained as a large-scale
use of what Liddell—Hart calls
“1and marines . . . advancing be-
hind ﬂeets of tanks, establishing‘
a chain of fortiﬁed bases, garri-
soned by heavy artillery . . . and
used to clear fortiﬁcations and
hill defenses under cover of ﬁre
from the tank fleet.” So many
men are involved in Russia simply
because it is a big country; and
so many men can be used in the
absence of gas.

Now that this country is com-
mitted to war, we should become
interested in military affairs. Un-
like most of military caste, Liddell-
Hart says it is the “normal citi-

' zens” that should ultimately decide
war policy in a republic.

Laborites dismiss Westbrook
Pegler with four words, “He is
anti-labor.” But such a brusque
dismissal of Pegler’s objections to
labor unions does not satisfy us.
To arrive at a proper» evaluation
of labor unions we ought first to
decide what are Pegler’s_ chief
criticisms of unions. Then we must

determine whether his criticisms

are logically right or wrong.

As I-understand Pegler, his in-
dictment of unions lists three ma-
jor charges: (1) that unions are
riddled ” with racketeers and graft-
ers (2) that unions refuse the
American worker his American
privilege of deciding for ‘or against
union membership (3) that unions
are controlled by leaders who have
set themselves up as dictators.

To Peg-ler’s charge of graft and
racketeering in unions, labor must
plead “guilty.” Pegler has proven

for the workers because graft is
present in their organizations.

All of us knowxthat even in out
government administration, local,
state, and national, graft is pres-
ent. Nobody, howcver, suggestl
as a solution to the problem the
abolition of government. ,
To condemn labor unions be-; 
cause of a Bioff or a Browne is 
like condemning‘ city government 
because of “Boss” Tweed or "Tam-. 
many Hall”-—like condemning 
state government because of a  
Huey Long or a Gene Talmadge--+ I’
like condemning national govern-. _,

Pegler-’s second charge is a more i
serious one. It presents labor um I‘

principles alien to the democratic

’ B1 JEAN GARLAND

Dr. Fritz Reiner led the Pitts-
orchestra

last Saturday night in the Syria
Mosque with Rudolph Serkin play-
ing the Brahms Concerto No. 1, in
D Minor, for piano and orchestra.
Mr. Serkin is well known and
admired here, after his perform-
ance of the Brahms B flat major
Concerto last year, and it was a
The

second and third movements of the

pleasure to hear him. again.

Concerto were especially congenial

to Mr. Serkin’s medium and man-
ner of expression. These move-
ments reflected the delicacy and
warmth of the soloist's musical
phrasing and feeling for the ro-
mantic in the long development of
thematic material.

In the ﬁrst movement, the solo
instrument was somewhat subor-
dinated to the orchestra. In the
last movement, which is rondo in

‘form, the piano achieves more

prominence and Mr. Serkin reveal-
ed his command of the keyboard
with considerable ease, and a son-
ority not easily forgotten.

It took the strange emotional
temperament of Wagner to paint
a tonal picture of such ethereal
beauty as the prelude to Act 1 of
“Lohengrin.” One feels, when lis-
tening to this music, an apparition
of the Holy Grail, a suggestion of
a monastary vision through the
vast space of the heavens._

The Schumann “Rhe.nish” Sym-
phony No. 3, is also a work re-
quiring great poetic and dramatic
insig-ht on the part, of the con-
rluctor. The name “Rhenish” is
implicitly authorized by the com-
poser who said that he wished to
convey some of the spiritual at-
nmsphere of the Rhineland.

AAUP Holds First
Meeting Today

At the ﬁrst meeting of the year
of the Pittsburgh chapter of the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors today, Dr. B. H.
Williams, pmfessor of political sci-
ence, will speak. The meeting will
begin at 12:30 o'clock in the Fac-
ulty club.

Dr. Ford E. Curtis, associate
professor of English and secretary
of the association, has urged all
members to attend since the dis-
cussion may decide the formation
of the policy of the Pittsburgh
chapter.

Peg]er’s Brusque . t. .

continued from page two
traditions of America. Pegler ob-
jects when a worker is forced to

‘ join a union. But what would hap-

pen to a union that did not insist
on a “closed shop?" The result
of such a policy is obvious. The
union would have little or no
power.

Employers, after all, are human.
Why should an employer hire men
who are organized for the express
purpose of forcing him to meet
certain conditions, when he may
hire men who are not so organiz-
ed? And what is to prevent an
employer from seeking only non-
union men, or from discriminat-
ing against union laborers?

Compare the principle of unity
in labor with that same principle
in government. Could a ‘state live
“outside of the Union?" Could a
local community demand indepen-
dence of its mother state? Silly
questions, aren't they, in the light
of what we know. We even fought
a war to force part of a nation to
remain in the Union. Why? Be-
cause we recognize that unity is
essential to strength.

The principle of ,“rule by the
majority” sustains in all these or-
ganizations. Why suddenly decide
that in unions the will of the ma-
jority should not prevail over the
desires of a minority‘! And when
moie than half the workers in a
plant. vote for a union. why
shouldn’t they insist that the re-
maining workers abide by their
decision?

The second part of Pegler’s in-
dictment is closely correlated with
the third—-the condemnation of
labor leaders as dictators. The
workers, complains Pegler, do as
their leaders advise. ln govern-
ment the people follow the advice
of their chosen leaders. In a busi-
ness corporntion who directs pol-
icy, thethousands of stockholders,
or the select board of directors?
Who directs activities in the clubs
to which we belong if not our
chosen officers?‘

The question we must decide is
not whether graft is present, not
whether unions should have closed

 --and —-not whether workers’

 

should follow the advice of their
leaders. The fundamental ques-
tion we must ask of ourselves is
whether we believe that workers
havethe right to organize them-
selves for their own protection.
If we grant that right, as indeed
our government and the courts
have, we must not prevent unions
from taking steps necessary to at-
tain that right. If you say that
you are for the principle of union
organization, and then if you pro-
test the attempts of unions to uni-
fy and consolidate themselves, you
are guilty of deliberate hypocrisy
or of inconsistent thinking. _

You may grant people rights by
the thousands. But if you prevent
them from realizing the beneﬁts
of your grants—have you given
them anything?

lt is no difficult task to find im-
perfections in union organization
and policy, just as it is no task to
discover flaws in any organization.
The difficult task is that of guard-
ing against proposals which pre-
tend only to eliminate flaws, but
which are aimed at the very foun-
dations of unions. Nor should we
be misled by the cries that “unions,
take away a man's liberties.”

The indispensable necessity of
any organization is that the mem-
bers must cede to it some of their
natural rights in order to rest it
with requisite powers. And ‘if you
wish to dispute this statement
consider‘ first that it was made by
an eminent American, John Jay,
in defense of a plan close to all of
us——the Constitution of the Unit-
ed States.

ing time out from the drudgery of ‘

able Ellington swing classics.

a sweet-tooth, we give you Russ
Morgan's waxing of WABASH
BLUES, Sammy Kaye's original A
FOOL WAS . 1, Blue Barron’:
NIGHT MUST FALL, and that
syrupy arrangement of Guy Lom-
bardo’s TEA FOR TWO.

out an assortment of boogie-
woogie music. Include Bradley’s
two famous boogies BEAT ME
DADDY, and SCRUB ME MAM-
MA, the Teddy Powell disc of

In official statements received

Two causes have been cited by

of Selective Service regulations

students drafted for military ser-

draft, and the monetary attraction
of industrial defense jobs. This is
especially true in the Pittsburgh

Sophomore pre-nursing students

 Students

Ingenuity 'n
Student ingenuityllmost often
comes to the fore in the ways in
which young men and women earn
money to pay for college tuition.

lt is estimated that at least half
the nearly 1,500,000 youths in
American colleges are working to
help pay their expenses, while 20
per cent are paying all their costs.
At one universit'y——-Berea college,
Kentucky—-every student is “re-'
quired to work at least part time.

‘One Massachusetts boy, 19 year
old Robert S. Fay, thoroughly dis-
liked his job of tending the coal
hopper on the_family’s stoker-fed
steam boiler. He perfected an ele-
vator to do it for him.

His lethargy was" rewarded by
his winning the Yankee ingenuity _
selsslszship of $500-rat ‘Worcester,

cent in the School of Medicine and
.3.3 per cent in the School of En-
gineering. _

This, is due to Selective Service
regulations, by which students in
medicine, engineering and certain
scientiﬁc ﬁelds are eligible for de-
ferment by local draft boards as
“essential men.”

Pitt, Carnegie Tech, and Penn

State show approximate decreases .

of ﬁve percent. West Virginia Uni-
versity’s enrollment decreased 10.
per cent, Duquesne’s remained the
same, and the roster of Pennsyl-
vania College for Womenishows
an increase of approximately five
per cent.

Ex-PittMen Get
Air Corps Posts

Two former Pitt students were
commissioned as second lieutenants
in the U S Army Air corps during
graduation exercises Friday at the
advanced ﬂying school in Barks-
dale ﬁeld, La.

They were Robert E. McLaugh-
lin, who attended the University
in 1939 and 1940, and Elmer S.

Waizenhofer, who was a student

in the College and in the School
of Medicine from 1933 to 1940.
Both men were appointed as air
corps cadets on March 17 and ad-
mitted to advanced training on Au-
gust 19.

Lieut. McLaughlin has been as-
signed to Barksdale ﬁeld as in-
structor and -Lieut. Waizenhofer
will be with the ferry command at
Stockton ﬁeld, Cal. ’

While at the University, Me.
Laughlin was a member of Sigma
Gamma Epsilon, honorary frater-
nity in the‘-School of Mines. Wai-
zenhofer was formerly a member
of‘ the 176th ﬁeld artillery of the.
‘Pennsylvania National Guard.

 Disp1ay
Job Finding

Fay made his machine from an
abandoned ensilage feeder and
parts of an old grist mill. For
power he harnessed an idle gaso-
line lawn mower motor.

A more novel way of paying
fees was employed by a University
of Cincinnati college of law stu-
dent, who, when paying his tuition
with 102 silver dollars, explained
that the money came from his side-
line as a justice of the peace.

But one of the easiest ways to
pay one’s tuition is to be born into
the right family——as evidenced by
the fact that prospective students
are eligible for a scholarship at
Princeton, and several of them at
the University of Pennsylvania, if
their father worked on the Penn-
sylvania railway.

T he Strange Visitor 
[ind  , Stinchcomib 

It was summer-——the ideal weath-

er for swimming, tennis, and sight-'~

seers through the Univ.ers.ity.

Within the ‘windowless, heavily
ornate Syria Lebanon room Dr.
James Stinchcomb, professor and
head of the classics department,
and six students were deeply im-
mersed in a. study of Homer.

In some manner this prompted
a_ discussion of brass and its use
as armor and shields. One of the
students had undertaken the ex-
planation when she was interrupt-
ed by the opening of the door.
Three persons stood in the door-

way. There was a tall,’ quiet-look-‘

ing man, a young girl,and an ex-
tremely loquacious matron.

Since it is customary to invite
visitors into nationality rooms, re-
gardless of whether a class is in
session or not, the students smiled
encouragement at the visitors and
then waited patiently for them to
leave.

The woman, however, had decid-
ed things otherwise. She entered
the room and seated herself beside
one of the students. Her com-
panions who seemed uncomfortably
conscious of the fact that all was
not as it should be, merely follow-

The woman then began to dis-
cuss the weather. lt was warm,
‘she said, though not so warm as it
was in her city; She then looked
hopefully toward the students, but
no one asked her where “her” city
was.

The student who had been recit-
ing before the interruption, at a
signal from . Dr. Stinchcomb, re-
sumed her discourse on brass---or,
at least, she tried to, for the per-

Revamped Pitt, Unbeaten Rams in

To Battle In series Final

Ringing down the ﬁnal curtain of the long and thrilling

series between the Panther and the Ram, Fordham’s unde-7

feated eleven will come to town next Saturday afternoon hop-
ing to leave an impressive blot on the Pitt record.

Coach Jim Crowley's boys are anxious to settle an old
score with the local gridders, and, if they had their wish,
would pile up as many tallies as possible to make the Pitt fans

remember them.

But it will take a much better football aggregation than
the present Fordham Rams to run up a large score, for a

ﬁghting and determined ball club is
hard to beat. That’s exactly what
the Pitts were last Saturday and

should be again this week.

Pitt surprised a lot of their fol-
lowers when they played the best
ball’ seen this year to extend the
powerful. Buckeyes, 21-14.

Fordham has been an erratic
ball club thus far this‘ year al-
though they hnve not lost a game.
In the inaugural against Southern
Methodist, the Rams gave the Mus-
tangs 10 points in the opening
half, then came from behind to
win, 14-10.

The following week they played
a mediocrevNorth Carolina squad,
and emerged with a 27-14 triumph.
In this ball game, the rabbit backs
of the New Yorkers kept them in
the ball game when the North
Carolina team kept knocking on
the Ram goal line throughout the
game.

West Virginia went to New York
for Fordham’s next game, and
came back to Morgantown sporting
a 27-0 loss. It was nothing unusual
for the Mountaineers, nor for the
Rams.

The following contest was played
with the Texas Christian team.
TC.U. was expected by many to
trip the Rams, but the Rams
weren’t to be tripped as they once
again came from behind in the last
half to win, 28-14.

Last week, one of Pitt’s earlier
opponents, Purdue, traveled to
New York for 1 look at the eastern
hopefuls for the Rose Bowl bid,
Fordham. The Rams hung to a
3-0 lead for two quarters then

scored two quick touchdown: to
annex their ﬁfth straight victory,
17-0.

After the

Boilermaker game,

‘ critics went into lengthy detail to

explain how great was this Ford-
ham combination. The Rams’ suc-

cess this season has been largely

due to the brilliant play of their
backﬁeld. Noble, Filipowisz, And-
rejco, and Blumenstock make up
one of the finest backﬁeld combina-
tion in the country. ‘

This quartet can run, pass, and
block along with the best of them,
and have been receiving nation-
wide praise for their stellar play.

As usual, For-dham’s ‘forward
wall is good. Although not as ter-
riﬁc as it was in the days of Wo-
jciechowicz, Pierce, and Franco, it
is better than average. Last week
against the Boilermakers the front
wall did not yield for one first
down.

Coach Charley Bowser gave his
footballers a much needed, and de-
served rest last Monday afternoon.
They did not report for practice.
until yesterday.

The head mentor intimated that
there would be only a few changes
in the lineup that started against
Ohio State. " V '

West, Jones, Dutton, and Saksa
will be the backﬁeld combination
against Fordham. Saksa played a
good offensive ball game, but
seemed to lac k the necessary
ﬁnesse in his defensive play.

Gervelis and Marty Rosepink
will be the starting ends. Rose-
pink entered the game late in the

third quarter for Hinte, and play- t

ed such good ball that both Stahl
and Hinte are out of varsity posts.
George Allshouse is a fixture at

Fresh Grid Squad Drills
Against Varsity This Week

Steady improvement is being
shown by the Panther frosh grid-
ders, as they go into the sixth
week of practice. Already in top
physical condition, the cubs are
running, kicking,_ passing, and
tackling a lot smoother than they
were a few weeks ago.

Scrimmage sessions are being
held at every practice. The squad
has not been cut on the part of the
coaching staff, but there has been
a decrease due to some members
dropping out of their own accord.
Those remaining will soon be di-
vided into teams.

These teams will be given Pitt
plays and" will be drilled in their
proper execution. Quite a few
members have been outstanding in
the sessions held so far. In the
backﬁeld, . halfback: D i M a t e o,
Catz, Cardicinni, Skertich, and
Smith, along with fullback: Bon-
jak, Montana, and quarterback Fu-
derick havegiven a good account
of themselves.

On the line, such men as Surina
and Resnik at center, McCurdy,
and Mathola at guards, Baker and
Brenner at tackle, and Pat West
at end are also proving their worth.

Of those named above, Pete Fu-
derich at 175 pounds has shown
that he is a speedster and a pos-
sible starter when the freshmen
scrimmage against the varsity.
Montana, in the fullback slot, is a
driver and may be a running mate
with Fuderick.

Glenn McCurdy, weighing 190
pounds, is working out at guard
and putting in a strong bid for the
first team freshman assignment.
Pat West, varsity quarterback
Wolfe West’: brother, is now on
thg Qsualty list, but is hoping to

recover in a hurry and take care
of one of the end positions.

End Novak has been switched to
a halfback position and the coach-
es expect to make more changes
like this one as soon as they get
a better line on the material at
hand.

 

FRANK SAKSA
keeps varsity post ,

the pivot post, while Bill Beng-
hauser and Bill Dillon will play at
guards. Dillon also entered the
game late as a reserve but came
through nobly. He was hurt on one
play and taken out, but will be in
tip—top shape ‘for next Saturday's
contest.

Bill Benghauser and Jack Duris-_

han will ﬁll the tackle slots. Duris-
han beat Kindelberger out of his
starting post prior to the Buckeye
contest, and played good, steady
ball throughout the contest.

  of the Pﬁ-

   

By VINCENT QUATRINI

Coach Novak’s Army Mules were
shod with their winning shoes last
Saturday morning as the West
Point harriers came out on the
short end of a 20-35 score to hang
up their second consecutive victory
over the Pitt thinclads in as long

. a time on a rain-soaked four and

one—half mile course at New York.

As gloomy and dreary as the day
was for the local runners, one ray

J of sunshine, however, broke

through. for the Olsonmen as Bill
Curtis, the ﬂashy sophomore, broke
the tape to win first honors for the
third straight time. Curtis was
clocked at 22:29 minutes.

The speedy Pitt flash took the
lead and was never headed
throughout the race. Captain. John
Brosky stayed on the heels of Cur-
tis for three and one-half miles
then was overtaken by six Army
spikers.

Rosell, luminary on the Service
cross country team, came in second,
twenty seconds later than Curtis.
Following himwere ﬁve other West
Point spikers with Densel in third
place, King in fourth, Dannocher
in ﬁfth, Warburton in sixth, and
Smiley in seventh position.

Only two other local boys ﬁn-
ished in the money. Brosky crossed
the ﬁnish line in eighth place and
Bob Graham trailed in tenth. Wil-
cox of Army captured the ninth
berth.

What follows, many will think
that the Pitt cross-country forces
are going to blame the defeat on
an alibi. This information was not
secured from the coach or any
member of the Blue and Gold
pack. lt isn't Pitt's athletic teams’
policy to make any excuses for
losing any kind of a contest, so
that is why we took the space to
inform our readers that what they
are about to read are facts.

After the results were in and the

BILL CURTIS
wins again

names of Marcus Allias and Bob
Davis didn’t appear in the first ten
spots, many questions of inquiry
began to pour in. It’s just one
simple statement as to the cause of
their not coming in as placers. Both
boys became ill with indigestion
along the course and were forced
to drop out.

However, this does not mean
that the Army Cross country ag-
gregation was not in its best
form because they had what it
takes to win a meet on Saturday.‘
Consequently, they came out of the
battle with the victor’s toga. Army
displayed hard running and a stout
hearted team on on the course.

The Panthers were up against
one of the strongest cross-country
teams in the country on Saturday.

Crowley, Rockne's Pupil,
Coaches Unbeaten Rams

By ‘ELAINE KAHN

Knute ' Rockne’s ‘famous Four
Horsemen have gone a long way
since they left Notre Dame. Don
Miller the quarterback gave up
football completely to devote his
time to practicing law in Cleve-
land. Harry Stuhldreher is now
coaching at Wisconsin and Elmer
Layden is czar of the National
Professional Football league.

James Harold (Sleepy Jim)
Crowley, considered by many to
be the most famous of the Four
Horsemen, is in his eighth season
as coach of the Fordham Rams.

Crowley is credited with being

Rockne’s number one disciple and

it is said that he, more than any

of the coaches who learned the
game at South Bend, best combines

Rock's ability and personality.

, The “Sleepy Jim” was tacked on
Crowley by Rockne himself.

It seems that Crowley complain-
ed -to him one day that, while he
slept all right at night and in the
morning and in the afternoon, he
has some difliculty in sleeping af-
ter practice. Rockne always add-
ed, however, that, although Crow-
ley might sleep everywhere else,
he was always wide awake on the
gridiron.

At any rate he was sufficiently

wide awake to merit being named,

All-American in 1924.

He was born in Chicago thirty-
nine years ago. When a small
boy, his family moved to Denver,
Colorado, and later to Green Bay.
He graduated from Notre Dame
in 1925 and went into coaching al-
most immediately afterwards. He
coached first at Michigan State
where his record of 22 won, 7

I i lost, and 3 tied resulted in his ap-

ham Rams. His Rams have, up to
this year, won 65, lost 13, and
tied 7.

This season’s team which the
experts have termed a “sure bet
for the Rose Bowl” won their first
ﬁve games.

According to a rather extrav-
agant statement in the Fordham
Press release “the coach who can
beat Crowley’s record for consist-
ency, is as extinct as the dino-
saur.” Be that as it may the facts
remain that he has had three sea-
sons where he lost three games,
three seasons in which he lost two,
six in which he dropped one, and
one undefeated year.

That undefeated year was 1937
when, with the Seven Blocks of
Granite line, one of the greatest
forward walls in the history of the
game, functioning with such per-
fection that no touchdown was
scored through it all season, Ford-
ham swept through unbeaten.

Officials who handled Fordham’s
games that year termed the Rams
one of the most smartly coached
squads they had ever watched.

Crowley is married. and has one
son. His wife, Helen, attended St.
Mary’s college which is near
Notre Dame, but the coach wants
it quickly understood that the
song “She Came From Old St.
Mary’s, He Came From Notre
Dame” was NOT inspired by their
romance.

Stories told about Crowley are
matched in number only by the
stories told about Layden. He has
a quick sense of humor and is as
noted for the stories he tells on
himself.

6 But, fortunately for his status
as a coach, his teams are superior
to his stories. ’

Army thus far in the current sea-
son in four meets is undefeated
and they have met some of the
toughest teams in collegiate com-
petition.

On the local menu for this week-
end will be one of the traditional
rivals of the Olsen coached pack of
Panthers. The Pitt thinclads will
make their third consecutive ap-
pearance on foreign soil when they
hit the road to State College to
take on the Nittany Lions« in a
fracas that will be in all probability‘
one of the hotest get-togethers in
the ’41 campaign for the Panthers.

If only they can hang up the
scalp of the Panthers, the Blue and
White cross country forces will
consider their season a success.
State has always been one of the
highest and most difficult hurdles
for the locals to hurdle. It will be a
cat eat cat affair.

The boys from Penn State will-

get a dose of poison that they
were not expecting, in Bill Curtis.
Curtis has already copped first
place in three contests and will
be out for his fourth triumph on
Saturday. Meet by meet Curtis is
slowly acclaiming national recog-
nition.

Probably those boys who have
been in the ﬁrst ﬁve places on the
roster of the Panthers will be cer-
tain to make the long journey up-
state. The sixth and seventh slots
will be ﬁlled by results of trials to
be run-off during the remainder of
the week.

 

Harriers Look To State/Axfter Army Loss

Unbeaten Punks Play
A P D Club Tomorrow

By MIKE HERMAN
This week’s football games

should go a long way in determin-
ing the ﬁnalists, for in both the

fraternity and independent leagues.

the two top ranking teams will
meet. In the Independent league,
it will be the Punks against a sure

Alpha Phi Delta team tomorrow‘

afternoon in what might be term-
ed “a battle for blood.”

Both teams are conﬁdent, and

are not unwilling to say so. John
Chaffo, Pitt News sportswriter
and APD spokesman predicts a
12-7 APD victory, while the Punk

representative said, “We’ll beat
them. Just wait and see.”
Both teams have won three

games. Five of the six victories,
however, have been forfeited to
these teams, with the Punks win-
ning over the Newman Club in the
only actually played contest, 53-0.
On the strength of that, the Punks
have been installed as the favor-
ites.

Meanwhile, the Fraternity
league presents a battle of giants
today when the Phi Eps ‘meet the
PiKA’s. The Phi Eps. were press-
ed hard to eke out a 13-12 win
over the Phi Delts last week, but
they have been pointing for this
game. The PiKA’s, on the other
hand, have been bowling over their

|¢u.4.4 jazz.-...,-. .,  

Jane Bolster, Ed42, chairman of
volleyball, announces that all wom-
en expecting to participate in the

not—too-distant volleyball tourna- .

ment should come to practice ses-
‘sions in the Cathedral gym.

Practice hours have been sched-

uled for Monday and Wednesday‘

afternoons, from 4:30 until 6
o’clock. At this time, equipment
will be ready for the use of all
members, and instructors will be
on hand to act as officials and
advisors.

This year, teams will be formed
of ﬁve girls in order to permit
more girls to take part, and more
games to run at the same time.
Also, with fewer members on a
team, an opportunity to really
learn the fine points of the game
will be had.

When the tournament has been
deﬁnitely scheduled, class teams
will be formed, with as many
teams entering from each class as

so desire. lnterclass competition
will then be held.

Mixed swimming, sponsored by
the Athletic Department, will be
held this evening and every Wed-
nesday evening .at the Trees pool.
All university students have been
invited to attend the mixed ses-
sions scheduled ‘from 7:00 until
9 :00 o’clock. ‘

Locker facilities will be made
available for all students. Students
should feel free to avail themselves
of this opportunity, as it is the
first time a program like this has
been sponsored.

Although the weather has not

but must be noted that when they,

meet the Phi Eps, they will be
meeting their strongest competi-
tion up to date.

The PiKA's will once again be

depending on the sharpshooting
passes of Gus Wilde and the block-

ing of Chuck Page to pull them ’

through, while the Phi Eps also
have a sharpshooter of their own,

Other games on the footfall
front this week show Phi Delta
Theta meeting the winner of the
Sigma Alpha Mu-Pi Lambda Phi
battle in a through-the-motions
game, and Phi Kappa meeting the
winner of the Delta Tau Delta-
Sigina Chi game. This last may
be important, for the Phi Kapi
showed a great deal» even in de-
feat, and the Delt pledge-class

made a very good impression in ‘ J J

beating the Phi Gams. Don’t count

. either of these teams out yet.

The ﬁnal game today has the
Newman Club meeting the winner
of the Dive
Chemist game. All three teams
have been defeated once.

erneriit System C
To Determine I

Cadets’ Aptitude

_A new demerit system has been

installed in the military depart-
ent to accurately judge military
aptitude of University cadets.
' Under the system, a certain
number of demerits will be given
for uniform violations, offenses in
, classrooms and ranks, and for oth-
er miscellaneous offenses.

Six demerits will be given for
 wearing improper or unauthorized
uniform, six for disorderly conduct,
20 for neglect of duty, and ﬁveifor
failure to salute. ‘

Lieutenant Ramon Dougan, as-
‘isistant professor of military sci-
ence and tactics, said, “The sys-
tem has been adopted in order to
judge more accurately a student's
military aptitude, a phase which
makes up half of a student’s
mark."

The demerit system will also be
used for entrance into Pitt Riﬂes,‘
honorary mi_litary organization,
and Scabbord and Blade, national
honorary military fraternity for
advanced cadets.

Students in schools sponsoring

University of Maine .to Stanford
in California were asked, “Would
you rather see football in your
school continue as an intercollegi-
ate sport, or would you rather sub-
stitute for it an expanded intra-

dents?”_

Eighty-seven per cent of these
students favored the continuation
of ‘big-time games while only ﬁve
per cent would rather substitute an
intramural program. Eight per
cent were undecided. '

Clearly indicating that students
think intercollegiate football is de-
sirable, results of the poll furnish
a contrast to the recent announce-
ment of President Robert M.
Hutchins of the University of Chi-

the school was getting along quite
well without intercollegiate ath-
letics. The game continues to
thrive in nearly every other univer-
