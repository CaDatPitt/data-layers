J Trustees vote to continue

selective divestment policy 

By Eric S. Poole
and Teresa Candori
The Pitt News

Pitt's board of trustees voted yester-
day to continue its policy of selective
divestment from South Africa. The
board based its decision on the
recommendations of an ad hoc ad-
visory committee to its investment
committee. =

O Posvar speaks out, page 7

The proposal -suggested that the
university continue to adhere to the
Sullivan Principles, which prohibit
racial discrimination in the
workplace; withdraw alljunds from
banks which provide new loans to
South Africa; and base decisions
about investments on reports from
the Investor Responsibility Research
Center, the Research Consortium on
American‘ Corporate Investments in
South Africa and the International
Council for Equality of Opportunity
Principles Inc. '

The proposal stipulated that the
board review its investment policy
next Mayland consider strengthening
the policy if ”reasonable progress
toward the dismantling of apartheid
and the creation of popular govern-
ment in South Africa has not been

achieved.”

the Sullivan Principles, has recom-

Executive Vice President Jack
Freeman is here to stay.

After a whirlwind summer which
began at Pitt, moved to Orono,
Maine, for a controversial two weeks
and ended with a surprising return to
Pitt, Freeman said he has no plans of
leaving again.

Last May, the University of Maine
System offered Freeman the position
of chancellor. He was to be respon-

the state. Healso would receive a
$114,000 annual salary, $35,160
more than the former chancellor,

David Flanagan, who was on the

chancellor, told the Portland Press-

necessary. ”If UM wants a resurgence
of quality at a national level  it has

said Tony Baldwin of the Black Ac-
tion Society. ”Now our Congress has
passed a law saying that the United
States should divest in South Africa.”

Tendayi Mundawarara of the Pitt
Divestment Coalition said,
”I am just totally flabbergasted that
after listening to Leroy lrvis’ impas-~-
sioned speech, that they could just
turn around, without even thinking
about it."

Posvar suggested that the matter of
divestment may soon become moot."

”I'm afraid to say that, when we
talk about timetables of 12‘ or 24
months, or in California, four years,
the issue is going to become moot,
because I think a violent revolution
will occur to such a degree in the
next two or three years that foreign
companies will pull out just for
reasons of physical safety,” he said.

In other business, the board ap-
proved resolutions creating the Jessie
Wright Award in Physical Therapy,
the Anne Pascasio Scholarship Fund,
the Frances Dilworth Lidiak
Memorial Fund and the Burrell K.

Bruce Lossein of the Office of

Development reported on the status- '

of the bicentennial celebration. He.
presented television Commercials

promoting the bicentennial, which

he said have been seen.nationaIly
during televised football games. The
Office of Development then
presented the members of the board
with bicentennial commemorative
neckties and letter openers.

Freeman told the Press-Herald he I
would be taking a ”modest loss of
salary," but that salary “was not the
attraction to come here.” He said he
was attracted by ”the challenge of the
job and the opportunity of serving the
system.”

On May 20, Freeman was official-
ly appointed chancellor of the
University of Maine System, effective
July 1.

Freeman cited these goals:
developing a community college
within the seven-campus system,
developing new links with industrial
and governmental sectors and
broadening academic programs.

He was apparentlyhappy, Maine
was happy, and Pitt was understand-
ing and supportive about his de-
parture. -

Things were smooth enough in the
beginning.

”Based on what I knew at that time;
it was a good opportunity to take an
institution that had not — probably
had never —— lived up to its potential
and to improve upon it and to
strengthen it,” Freeman said. ”I
thought it was an interesting
chaﬂengef’

Then came the problems.

”What I found when I arrived was

- that the financial situation under the

existing system far outweighed, in my
view, the potential for funding.

’’I knew, obviously, about the
financial situation, but I didn't realize
how serious it was.’“After an intensive
two-week period of probing, I con-
cluded that there was simply no _way

”Also, I had no idea of the intense
degree with which decisions at the
university were politicized,” he con-
tinued. ”There is heavy involvement
by the board of trustees and the
legislatures. I am accustomed to [the
people of] this institution being a

pretty professional type of people. I .
’don’t think that was the way of do-

ing business in Maine. It was simply
contrary to what I regard as the pro-
fessional way to act at a university."

”And so I concluded, after living
there for a certain period and ex-

it certainly didn't correspond with the

Executive Vice President Jack
Freeman has been with Pitt since
1967, the year that President Posvar
took the position as chancellor.

Posvar and Freeman had served
together in the Air Force academy for
several years. At the time Posvar
became chancellor, Freeman was
serving in the Pentagon.

”For personal reasons I reached the
decision to leave the Air Force,” said
Freeman, ”and since Posvar’s in-

Freeman said that right now things
are going extraordinarily well with

OSLO, Norway — Elie Wiesel, an
author and a survivor of the Nazi
holocaust, was awarded the 1986
Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday.

The prize committee said it chose
Wiesel because of his commitment
to human dignity and his efforts
against the forces of repression in the
world.

”Elie Wiesel has emerged as one
of the most important spiritual leaders
and guides in an age when violence,
repression and racism continue to
characterize the world,” a
spokesman for the prize committee
said.

Wiesel, 58, a naturalized American
who lives in New York City and is a
professor at Boston University, has
written extensively on a wide range
of human rights issues, including his
experiences in concentration camps
during World War II and the condi-
tion of Jews in the Soviet Union.‘

Wiesel, who spoke with reporters
after learning he had won, said he
hopes the major benefit of being a
Nobel laureate will be educating
those who do not understand the
holocaust.

”I don't want to forget the cost to

humanity,” he said. ”There is an

urgency. My people will remember
and be remembered."
The peace prize was the second of

day for their work in cell and tissue
research.

Reagan says summit
invite remains open

WASHINGTON —— In a nationally
televised speech Monday night Presi-
dent Reagan blamed Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev for the failurepto
achieve agreements in Iceland on the
reduction of nuclear weapons.

Reagan also said that despite the
apparently unproductive meetings in
Reykjavik, his invitation to Gor-
bachev to come to the United States
for a summit meeting was still in.
effect.

Reagan said he broke off the
meetings in Iceland rather than com-
promising on the Strategic Defense
Initiative or ”Star Wars” program.

The Soviets reportedly insisted that

‘the United States agrees not to per-

form any ”Star Wars” research for the

next 10 years in return for the Soviets

agreeing to an arms control proposal.

NEWS BRIEFS

ASSOCIATED PRESS

But Reagan did say that he is op-
timistic that an arms control accord
can still be reached.

’’I am still optimistic that a way will
be found,” he said. ”The door is
open, and the opportunity to begin
eliminating the nuclear threat is
within reach.”

Officials support
aid to Contra rebels

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador —
For the first time, sources have linked
American officials to the delivery of
supplies to Contra rebels fighting the
pro-Soviet Nicaraguan government of
Daniel Ortega.

Two sources said Tuesday that they
strongly support the effort to aid the
Contras and decided to speak out
because of the ”amateurishness” of
the operations to aid the rebels.

”If U.S. officials said the US.
government has nothing to do with
this, they are wrong,” said the
sources, who insisted on remaining
anonymous.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October l5_, I986

  Holocaust survivor wins Nobel Peace Prize

According to the report in the New
York Times, the sources backed cap-
tured American Eugene Hasenfus,
who told Sandinista officials that a
CIA operative was in charge of the
mission during which Hasenfus was
shot down.

Both sources said the man named
as a CIA agent goes by the name Max
Gomez, but his real name is Felix
Rodriguez. Rodriguez, they said, is
probably no longer directly em-
ployed by the CIA, but helps carry
out CIA projects in the area, and his
work may be ”indirectly financed by
the CIA through private Cuban-
American groups in Miami.”

President Reagan has repeatedly
denied that there is any U.S. invov|e-
ment in the airlifting of supplies to the
Contras and insisted instead that such
airlifting is being financed through
private financial groups.

‘Hope for survivors

Freeman

Continued from page 1

”It was simply a professional deci-
sion that I had to make,” Freeman
said. ’’In a situation like that, you
either get out before it's too late, or
you tough it out and make the best
ofa bad situation. I didn't want to do
the latter. So I resigned ‘and came
back here after President Posvar in-.
formed me the positi_on was still
open.’’

’’It was a source of great relief and
excitement when he told me he
would be coming back,” said Posvar.

The response in
kind.

”He really let us down,” said
Flanagan in the July 18 Press-Herald.
”He let the state down.” Flanagan

. said he believed Freeman's ex-

ti‘

/ﬁg.

perience would have enabled him to
deal with the problems he cited as
the reasons for leaving.

Freeman's criticism of the political
climate at Maine also disturbed
Maine Governor Joseph Brennan,
who said Freeman ”wasn’t here long
enough to make such judgments.”

Jessica Lowell, editor of the Bangor
Daily News, held a similar view. ”He
said he wasn't expecting it to be as
tough to get money as it was. I don't
understand why he didn't research
this more. It's a momentous move
from Pittsburgh to here.”

Maine was not

University of Southern Maine Presi-
dent Robert Woodbury, who re-
placed Freeman at Maine on Sept.
15, told the Press—HeraId the shock
of Freeman's leaving would subside

"and ”the system will continue to

grow and develop. -

”I had obviously only worked with
him a short time, but I thought he
would be good for the university in
general ‘and our campus, too.”

As far as Freeman is concerned, the
whole episode ”is water under the
bridge.”

’’In Maine they have selected a suc-
cessor, a person from inside the
system who may find it easier to deal
with their problems,” said Freeman.

Looking back now, Freeman said
he would have done things different-
ly. ’’I came very, very close in April
to turning the position down. But
then I received some assurances from
people there that certain things could
be done, so I decided to go.

’’I only regret that I didn't know
things in April that I learned in July,
or I would have never taken the posi-
tion. That would have made things
better for them, better for me and bet-
ter for the University of Pittsburgh —
plus I'm happier here. But sometimes
you can't foresee those things. Under
the circumstances, I'm simply glad to
be back here. I should never have
left.” I

Pitt thefts decreasedespite 
recent violence in Oakland 

By Jill Carell

Sta ff Writer

Despite the recent increase in
violence in Oakland since the start of
the school year, the number of thefts
on Pitt's campus has declined 1 1 per-
cent since last year.

I From Sept. 1 to Oct. 5, 1985, 73
thefts occurred on Pitt's campus.
Only 62 took place during these
same months in 1986.

According to Gary Moses, assistant

. director for Field Services, ’«’They [the

thefts] are not in any particular area,

' they are spread out evenly around the

campus area.”

There has only been one major
theft this year. During the weekend
of Sept. .12-15 a computer was stolen
from a professor's office in the Frick
Fine Arts Building. The professor,
who wishes to remain anonymous,
discovered his computer missing
when he entered his office the

- following Monday morning. ”They

[the thieves] must have used a master
key to enter my office,” said the pro-

fessor. ”l locked my office door
before I left on Friday for the week-
end.” According to police reports
there was no trace of a break in.

Although it has not been reported
to the police, a typewriter was said
to have been taken from the fine arts
building earlier in September. There
was no evidence of a break-in in this
incident either. ”If it was a universi-
ty typewriter, it should have been
reported. I don't see why it wasn’t,”
said Moses.

Of the 62 thefts that have occurred
this year, 20 arrests or detainments
have been made. All of these appear
to have been unrelated incidents.
There have been a few attempted

vehicle thefts in the garages, but ar- g

rests were made. The majority of in-
cidents have been petty thefts such
as books, knapsacks, money and
coats. ' .

According to Moses, the decrease
in thefts can be attributed to educa-
tion. Hillman Library has had the
fewest recorded thefts of all the
buildings on campus. ’’It is the safest
place to go and leave your belong-

ings,” he said. Moses believes this
comes from warning the students

who use the library to keep an eye- -

on their belongings.

Thefts at Trees Hall "declined 29
percent since last year. This can be

attributed to the guarded lockers near I

the entrance of the building. There
are also security guards in Trees Hall
and in the field house. ”Trees Hall
has been relatively quiet this year;
there have only been a few minor
thefts,” said Moses.

Not only has the number of thefts

this year decreased, but also the -

degree of the thefts has decreased.

Loss of money and valuables is

down. r

\

17 percent since last year. The minor
thefts include things such as food and
money.

The vast majority of buildings ‘at,-

Pitt are protected by electronic locks,

and a proportion of the buildings _

have alarms. They are also constant-
Iy"being patrolled by the campus‘
police. Judging by the statistics,‘these
measures seem to be effective.

 Iceland: a lot of
-stalk and that's it

Well, Reagan and Gorbachev had another summit last weekend.

sat down and talked face-to-face twice so far, and no substantive
agreements seem to have been reached. Why they even bother is
a very popular question these days. Relations between our two coun-
tries haven’t improved much since the two men have met, so why
do they bother to have summits? Should they continue to do so?
They must bother, and both leaders have to put forth the time and

J ’ V effort to improve the relations between the two dominant powers.’

The Vienna and Reykjavik summits are steps in the right direction.
But one summit a year is not enough. Especially-when the last one
was only two days long. Summits are progress, but such meetings
with no results are not enough. They must strive to come to
agreements concerning. the arms race. After every summit so far,
Reagan has come away ”hopeful”;”Gorbachev has also. Do these
men realize that the citizens of their respective countries are hopeful
before these summits, but afterwards grow increasingly disillusioned?
A Saying ”|et’s end the arms race” is easy. Acting on this is another
matter. Government officials are forever saying that progress is be-

H. ing made. Progress being made by whom and for whom? Enough

rhetoric. The U.S. and Soviet people want and deserve straight

. answers and legitimate improvements in relations between our coun-

tries. Enough idle talk already, let's see some real action.

Trustees are still
turning deaf ears

ty of Pittsburgh took place yesterday (Tuesday, Oct. 14). The main
topic of discussion was ”Wi|l Pitt finally and fully divest its holdings
from South»Africa?” The answer was no. The university will continue
on its current course of selective divestment.

Through the oftentimes thick rhetoric, one could and can see that
some progress has been made in regard to Pitt's program of divest-
ment. The process of divesting selectively is a slow one, but Presi-
dent Posvar was quick to point out that of the 100 universities and
colleges that have decided to selectively or totally divest, Pitt is ranked

’ '11th in terms of monetary value of South African—affiliated stocks sold.

Thirty-nine institutions of the aforementioned 100 have decided to
divest totally their South African interests. The value of Pitt's divestiture
so far is greater than all but seven. That's honestly not such a terrible
track record when one compares us to the rest_ of the institutions in
this country.

But don't we always try to stand apart from other schools? Pitt is

~ A always trying to come out on top — to be first in every endeavor and

department. To borrow a quote from Lee lrvis, a trustee for 16 years
and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, ”Why
is it we will be satisfied with being No. 11 in divestment, and we
want to be No. 1 in football?” Excellent idea, Mr. lrvis! That, and
a valid point.

‘ Is the board of trustees satisfied with where they are now? If so,
why?

Pitt's involvement in the racist regime of South Africa is immoral.
The university constitutionitself has a policy of non-discrimination;
l‘I0\?|/?Can anyone justify the lack of one in our investment policy as
we .

Last week, The Pitt News encouraged the divestment marchers to
re-direct their energies away from rallies and toward more intensive
lobbying efforts. Yesterday's board meeting proves that the marches
may have raised the students’ consciousness, but the board is still
out to lunch. Write them a letter and let them see your outrage.

tep definition

of ’Star Wars’ defense plan

Believe it or not, President
Reagan did the right thing in
”scuttling” the ”mini-summit” in
favor of the Strategic. Defense In-

' itiative or ”Star Wars.”

For those who are not quite
sure what SDI is, it is a space-

' based missile defense system pro-

tecting primarily the United
States and the "rest of North
America and, secondarily, our
allies against nuclear attack. In
the event. of a nuclear war, it,
would ideally destroy all or near-
ly all incoming nuclearmissiles.

Several systems have been pro-
posed on how to disable nuclear
missiles before impact.

Particle Beam Weapons project I

highly charged atomic nuclei
toward their target in a narrow
conical stream. A nuclear
warhead cannot be detonated
without computer control. These
highly charged particles would
scramble the on-board computers
of a nuclear missile and essential-
ly turn it into a highly expensive,
slightly radioactive chunk of
metal that would eventually fall
back to earth.

High-energy Lasers are beams
of coherent light that would
either disable the missile
physically (burn it out of the sky)
or would again scramble the on-
board computer systems. ‘ -

Electromagnetic rail guns
would use a magnetic field to ac-
celerate a mass of iron or steel
slugs to extremely high velocities
and knock out the missiles like
buckshot hitting a grape.

Air-launched ASATS (anti-
satellite weapons) currently con-
sist of a missile approximately 13
inches in diameter that can be
launched from the belly of an
F-15 into low orbit to knock out
hostile satellites. Now, though,
there. are several alternate
systems being tested, and they
will soon be deployed, including
several space—based options.

X-ray Lasers are presently what
are called our pop—up defense,
meaning that when an attack is
confirmed these would be ac-

tivated by the detonation of a
small ”pony nuke” (less than five

(

CHRIS
KAI.E'I'KA

kilotons). This would provide as
many as several dozen streams of
coherent x-rays, each powerful
enough to. nullify a nuclear
missile. _ -

No single one of these systems
would be used exclusively. They
would probably all’ be used
together in a ”layered defense
screen” that could conceivably
stop up to 99.9999 percent of all
incoming missiles.

SDI is an innovation, a wel-
come relief to the Mutual Assured
Destruction policy that we have
relied on for so many years. This
simply means that if you can an-
nihilate me, and I can annihilate
you, why would I attack you if I
would only be destroyed in the
bargain? This is total lunacy! It
doesn't take into account meteor
showers, accidental launches, or
quite possibly the sheer desper-
ration of a nation deluded into
the idea that it has nothing else
to lose. 50 essentially this means
that the world has been standing
around with a pistol cocked to
humanity's head for the last
quarter of a century.

When we build ”Star Wars,”
we will have freed America from
-the horrors of nuclear war. We
will have a shield, a defense not
only for America but for the rest
of the free world as well.

There are those who say that
”Star Wars” will not work. Ed-

ward Teller not only thinks so, '

but is willing to put his profes-
sional reputation on the line. Ed-
ward Teller not only helped build
the first atomic and fusion bombs,
but also worked on the Mercury,
Gemini, Apollo and Space Shut-
tle systems. He knows what he is
talking about. There have always
been negativativists and nay-
sayers, the perpetuators of
counterculture. They were there
when the Wright brothers flew at
Kitty Hawk, when the Germans
built the V-2 and when an
American walked on the naked
face of the moon. They are here

now. Pay them no mind, they
lack vision.

There are those who say it
won't be effective. If not, then
why Gorbachev’s reaction at
Reykjavik? Anything that can in-
timidate a Russian like thatjwill
certainly be effective!

There are those who say that it
is notrworth the cost. At what
cost? The lives of two billion peo-
ple who live in the free world? I
don't think that that would need
any further _iustification.

Star Wars is due to be deployed
starting in 1994 and to be com-
pleted before 2000. Only 14
years until the threat of nuclear
destruction is a thing of the past.

Let's face it, many people have
called ”Star Wars” insane, but
only the insane ‘would throw
away the only defense against
certain death. ”Star Wars” is well
worth a few paltry reductions that
would still leave our enemy
capable of our total destruction.

President Reagan acted only as
a man truly concerned about the
fate of his country could have
acted, trying to nullify a foreign
threat as best as he was able
without compromising the safe-
ty of his country or people.

Pictures
make me
envious

Q. I am a pretty good—looking
female, and I ’m used to eating right,
exercising and grooming to look my
best. Lately I have been feeling extra
competitive, and I feel nagged by
what used to seem natural. I look in
the mirror with a scared frown and
suppress it._I keep looking and try-
ing to appear better than the girls my
boyfriend looks at: the ones in the
girlie magazines. Maybe I am extra

‘worried because he is so good-

looking, the best-looking guy I ever
saw. When we first went together he
thought of no one but me, and now
I see him looking at those women.
It's interfering with my actual sexual

pleasure, too; I feel myself holding-

back.

A. I hear this about rivalry with the
centerfold women a good deal, and
usually I just say forget it —— it is
natural to look at other sex objects.
It doesn't mean he doesn't love you-
He is interested in women —— that is
why he is attached to you — but you
supply real companionship, you are
the one he wants to be with, not just
look at or fantasize about. If a guy
looks at a girlie magazine, the effect
is usually good. It stimulates him,

. keeps up his interest in sex general-

ly and you get the benefit. It is dif-
ferent if he spends hours alone with
these pictures and neglects you. That
would show an obsessive interest,
something to worry about.

But from what you tell me, you are
the one showing the obsessive signs,
because you are thinking about this
”rivalry" and worrying about it even

WESTHEIMER

when he is making love to you. I am
sure that you can see that this is
wrong and illogical, but that doesn't
get rid of it. Have a talk with a
counselor. Sharing your worry with
an informed listener just once or
twice may make it evaporate.

Q. The first time a girl has inter-
course, shouldn't there be some s_ign
of the hymen breaking? A friend of
mine was wondering. ’

A. We have a traditional mental
picture of this, and so we tend to
think it always happens. But it
doesn't, and nobody has to be upset.
Look, it isn't always a nice day for
graduation or a wedding, but you still
get a diploma or a ring. Nowadays,
as a matter of fact, we speak of the
hymen stretching instead of breaking
—- stretching is what really physical-
ly happens. Sometimes the hymen

stretches without any spotting at all. I

But if the woman has never had in-
tercourse with a man before, she
came to that ﬁrst time as a virgin, and
neither he nor she should think other-
wise. That there is always some
blood is just a folk tradition that has
caused a lot of needless anxiety both
before and after the event.

There is an alarming trend forming
in the land. .

I first noticed it when I had com-
pleted a conversation with a female
acquaintance. We weren't good
enough friends to part with a social
kiss, but we knew each other too well
for a handshake. So, I briefly put my
hand on her shoulder and said, ”See
you later.’’

Only, as I put my hand on her
shoulder, I felt as ifl had made a terri-
ble mistake. There was something
there.

It felt like a football player's
shoulder pad. I thought that she must
suffer from some embarrassing defor-
mity and that she was wearing the
shoulder pad as a kind of prosthesis.
I quickly removed my hand from her
shoulder and made a hasty retreat. I
was sheepish about what I had done.

In the days after this occurrence,
however, I began to notice some-
thing. On the street, in restaurants,
almost all women were looking
broad in the shoulders. It wasn't just
this one woman. Women all over the
place were beginning to look like
linebackers. .

One day I noticed a female friend
with burly shoulders, and she was a
woman with whom I felt comfortable
enough to ask about it. She laughed
and said, ”It’s just the fashion right
now. Women are all wearing shoul-

der pads. There's nothing physically ‘

wrong with the women. They just
like the shoulder pads.”

In the ensuing days, I began to pay
attention. And it was true, it was true;
women were striding the avenues
looking like Herschel Walker on
game day.

I found this confusing. The way I
grew up, men were supposed to have
broad, brawny shoulders. That was
the ideal look for a male. Women

 

-;

BOB GREENE

were supposed to have dainty,
rounded shoulders. That was the
ideal look for a female.

And now this.

Rather than brood, I consulted a
number of women's fashion experts
and asked them what was going on.

Sandy Kagan of I. Magnin said,
”They’re like pacifiers for women.

' They make women feel chic. You can

buy your clothes with shoulder pads
already built’ into them, or you can
go to the lingerie department and buy
them separately to put into your own
clothes. There are women who are
even wearing shoulder pads under T-
shirts now.-

”It gives a woman a good shape.
If a woman has big hips, the shoulder
pads will draw attention away from
her hips and will actually make her
hips look smaller.”

At Bonwit Teller, Mary Riley said,
”Shoulder pads balance out a wo-
man's silhouette. Obviously, though,
you can overdo it. If a woman wears
a blouse with shoulder pads in it, a
blazer with shoulder pads in it and
an overcoat with shoulder pads in it,

Stylish or handicapped?  

then she's not going to look like a
woman — she's going to look like
William Perry. We sell an undershirt
with shoulder pads built in. Youwear

it under your blouse and — voila! — - .

instant shoulders.” L

Joan Weinstein of Ultimo said,
”European women have been wear-
ing shoulder pads for years. The

reason you're seeing them so much,

now is that they're filtering down to

the lower-price lines, and more’

American women are wearing them.
And contrary to what you believe,
Mr. Greene, no woman wants small,
rounded shoulders.- All women want

‘shoulders in their clothes that l_ook as

if a hanger is already there.”
So it truly is happening. A female

executive at one leading women's. '

clothing store — who insisted on re-
maining anonymous, for fear of

offending some of her best customers

— said, ”There may be a subliminal
thing going on here. Women in the

business world may want to have’/,  I
shoulders as broad as men so that’,

they send: out the message of asser-
tiveness. By having broad shoulders,"
they may be saying that they are on
equal footing with their male col-
leagues.”

I must confess that some of the ex-
perts with whom I talked thought I
was making a big deal out of nothing.
When I asked Nena Ivon of Saks Fifth
Avenue about the grand meaning of
all this, she said, ”You don't want to
talk to a fashion person. You want to
talk to a psychologist.”

Still, it intrigues me. The next time
you go out, take a look around you
and see if you don't agree that it is
getting out of hand. These women

look as if they could blind-side you .

and flatten you. And yes — this is one
of those topics that I wouldnft mind
hearing your opinion on.

Pitt prof says U.S. wants to 
maintain edge over Soviets

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

The recent Iceland summit col-
lapsed because the United States
seeks to maintain superiority over the
Soviets via the Strategic Defense In-
itiative, according to Jonathan Harris
of the department of political science.

”The Soviets believe they have
achieved parity over the last few
years and that SDI upsets this delicate
balance,” Harris said.

Harris contended that Soviet fears
of SDI are twofold. For one, he said
the Reagan administration believes
SDI might someday enable the
United States to stop counterattack-

' ing Soviet missiles. Secondly, Harris

said SDI research, at least from the
Soviet perspective, could lead to the

”Gorbachev has been extremely-

critical of moving the arms race into

Despite Soviet fears, Harris said
that Reagan ”will likely remain un-

willing to give up on SDI.” The USSR
might therefore just put off |ong-term

‘ strategic talks with the next U.S. ad-

ministration. _

In light of the fact that SDI remains
such an imposing obstacle, Harris
said he is impressed by the wide

cussed in Iceland..

”What’s surprising is the scope of
the effort — most observers thought
they [Reagan and Gorbachev] would

put off the real stuff to a later date.
Obviously, this wasn't the case.”

Harris maintained that Soviet pro-

Posvar resents accusations of
protestors’ divestment chants

By Teresa Candori
Assistant News Editor

Referring to what he termed ”a

“ disturbing side issue” of the divest-

ment campaign, President Wesley
Posvar addressed yesterday's board
of trustees meeting about implied
charges of murder and genocide.

A common practice at campus di-
vestment rallies is the chanting of
slogans such as, ”Posvar, Posvar, you
can't hide; we charge you with geno-
cide.” Posvar said he resents this type
of implication.

’’Although I can understand hyper-
bole and exaggeration and rhetoric,
this sort of thing is not easy to take,”
Posvar said.

Board member and State Speaker
of the House Leroy lrvis, who earlier
in the meeting spoke strongly in favor

of a vote for total divestment, said he
had been unaware of such accusa-
tions and would have addressed the
matter earlier in the meeting had he
known about them. He promised
Posvar he would look into putting a
stop to such chants.

Posvar praised the discussions on
South Africa and said he was im-
pressed with the sincerity and con-
viction of Irvis’ address..

”The case for total divestment is
sincere and logical in its symbolism
and in the principle of sending a
message," Posvar said.

However, he argued, ”As long as

hwe can do some good, we ought to

stay there.”

Posvar said he hopes the universi-

‘ ty community can work together on

the need for social justice and equali-
ty of opportunity.

Most of the approximately 50 pro-
testers present left the meeting im-
mediately after the board voted to
continue the policy of selective
divestment and were not present to
hear Posvar’s report. *

tries and how to work together to

I bring peace and hope into their

futures. A curriculum emphasiz-
ing youth leadership is being
prepared with the cooperation of
Educators for Social Responsibility
to accompany the tour.

Locally, the tour will host
students from Lebanon,
Guatemala, South Africa, the
Philippines and two American
students. The Pittsburgh area
sponsoring committee consists of
members of local service, educa-

tional and religious organizations.

Plans include a day at the Pitts-
burgh Presbytery’s Camp Crest-
field near Slippery. Rock, a
church-youth event in the east
suburbs, a worship service at First
Presbyterian Church downtown,
an appearance on the Rev. Ron
Lengwen’s KDKA radio program
and an appearance on KDKA-TV’s
Pittsburgh 2 Day.

The children ‘will visit Plum

High School and Mt. Lebanon_ -

High School and meet with some
Pitt students. On Tuesday, Nov.

18, a special open program for '

high school students from any
school in the area will be held at

7500-year-old cloth

Pitt anthroplogy department studies ancient artifact

By Eric S. Poole
Staff Writer

A 7,500-year-old cloth, the oldest
perishable item ever found in the
eastern United States, is currently be-
ing studied by the University of Pitts-
burgh anthropology department.

The cloth was found at the Win-
dover Archeological Project in
Titusville near the Cape Kennedy
Space Center.

”A group of land developers, in-
cluding the owner of the Eckerd drug
store chain, were excavating when
they began to hit human bone,” said
James Adovasio, chairman of Pitt's

' ‘anthropology department. ”At this

point, they called in the Florida State

V University archeology department.”

Since then, the FSU crew,‘ headed

.. by David Dickel and Glenn Doren,

has found the remains of at least six-
ty people. Of those 60, 14 had suf-

"They have found a second textile,
but it is not as large as this one,”
Adovasio said, referring to the ar-
tifact.

The cloth, approximately 1.5 by
2.5 feet in size, was found at the Win-
dover site two weeks ago today.‘ it
was removed from the ground Friday
and arrived in Pittsburgh on Saturday,
packed in a 90-pound crate, and pro-
tected by spray foam, duct tape and
a sheet.

Adovasio said that the cloth is
either an article of clothing or a burial
shroud.

”|t’s still hard to tell until we can
examine one of the edges.  It is
worn in different places, which could
mean that it [the cloth] is an article
of clothing rather than a burial
shroud,” said Adovasio.

In order to examine the edges,
Adovasio pointed out, they first have
to be pulled awaygfrom the bones of
the 12-year-old girl who has been,
wrapped in the cloth for 7,500 to
8,000 years, according to 16 carbon
datings done on various human re-

6:00 - 7:45 pm

   
    
  

mains found in the bog.

”Litera||y, everything that you see
here that is not [human] bone is cloth;
it is just obscured in some places,”
said Adovasio. ‘

There are two ideal conditions for
the natural preservation of ancient ar-
tifacts such as the cloth now housed
at the Basketry Analysis lab in" the
basement of Forbes Quadrangle. The
first and most common condition is
dryness, such as in the caves in the
Far West, where many well-
preserved artifacts are found.

In most cases, if an artifact is
allowed to absorb moisture, it will
decay more rapidly. For this reason,
very few perishable items are found
other than in the dry caves of the Far
West.

The other condition is to keep oxy- 8

gen off the surface of the artifact, as
it is the combination of moisture and

oxygen that will decompose the ar- .

tifact.

developers, there was a presence of
tannic acid which repelled the
oxygen.

Since the moisture of the bog was
one of the preservatory factors of this
cloth, it was_ essential to keep the
cloth from drying out.

”lf it dries out, it will crack, and as
soon as it cracks, it will start to
decompose,” said Adovasio as he
sprayed the cloth with water.

Adovasio said that the cloth could
be exposed to air for only a brief
period of time. »

One of the things learned from this

find is that the culture of the Indians

of central Florida in the early archaic
age (8,500 B.C. to the beginning of
the pottery age) was more advanced
than previously imagined.

The cloth was made by twining. In
twining, fibers of plants are twisted
in pairs or more. The Windover cloth,
which is theorized to be Palmetto,
was an example of a complex triple-
strand twining, indicating that this
society had the time,to make a higher
quality of cloth.

Adovasio said, ”The find’s
significance lies in the fact that it's
weaving pattern is much more so-
phisticated than one would expect.
It shows  that their social and
economic organization was much

greater than suggested by stereotypes

of hunters and gatherers.”

Adovasio said that the triple-.

twining process took quite a long
time to do.

After Adovasio, Rhonda Andrews,
head of Pitt's Basketry Analysis lab,
and Joan Gardiner of the Carnegie
Museum record some more informa-
tion, they will return the cloth to FSU.

After the FSU anthropology depart-
ment completes its tests on the cloth,
it will presumably be placed in a
museum at Gainesville.

Adovasio worked at the Smithso-
nian lnstitute until 1972 when he
began to work at Pitt; He was pro-
moted to head of the anthropology
department in 1980. He is also the
head of the University of Pittsburgh
Cultural Research Center, the largest
of its kind in North America.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 15, I986

Bernier appointed as

dean of med school

By Brenda Bravis

For The Pitt News

George Matthew BernierJr., M.D.,
has been appointed dean of the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine effective January I987.

Bernier is currently a professor and
chairman of medicine at the Dart-
mouth Medical School and chairman

of medicine at the Dartmouth-,

Hitchcock Medical Center.

He will be the IOth dean in the
I00-year history of the School of
Medicine.

The appointment was announced.

last week by President Wesley W.
Posvar and Thomas Detre, the senior
vice president for the health sciences.
Detre has been serving as interim
dean of the School of Medicine since
1984, after the departure of Donald
Leon who resigned to return to full-
time faculty status at'the School of
Medicine.

”Bernier’s distinguished career in
academic medicine makes him ideal-
ly suited to lead the medical school
as it seeks to achieve new levels of
national and international acclaim in
research and clinical excellence,”
said Posvar. -

”The next decade will be one of
growth for the university's health
sciences,” said Detre. ”Bernier’s

credentials as a scientist, teacher and
clinician give him a special sensitivity

to the challenges and opportunities»

inherent in a dynamic academic
medical center.”

Bernier, commenting on his goals
here at Pitt, said, ”One thing I would
like to see is collaborated interaction
between the basic science depart-
ments and the clinical science depart-
ments.”

Before his position at Dartmouth,
Bernier was a professor of medicine
at Case Western Reserve University
in Cleveland, Ohio. He was also a
research hematologist at Walter Reed
Army Institute of Research. Bernier,
a graduate of Harvard Medical
School, is certified in internal
medicine with subspecialties in
hematology and oncology.

Among the awards Bernier has
been honored with are a five-year ap-
pointment as scholar for the
Leukemia Society of America, Inc.,
the Alumni Association Award from
Harvard Medical School and the
House Staff Award for Outstanding
Clinical Teaching at the University
Hospitals of Cleveland. He has writ-
ten and co-authored more than 75
journal publications and more than
35 abstracts, many chronicling his
research in immunology and on-
cologyr.

Be groovy.

SOUTH BEND, Indiana -— Notre
Dame students can't dance.
_ Remember in high school when

‘students just kind of waved their
A arms and smiled and maybe

shuffled their feet a little?
That's what you'll find at Notre

_ Dame.

The ‘(Senior Bar,” like every-
thing else on the campus, is very
nice. It was built for seniors at the
campus, and seniors are all you
will see there.

After you get through the turn-

_ j — I sti|e,at’the door and pay _your
*' . dollar cover-charge, you walk into

the first room of the building,

 which has a bar and a big screen
-TV and pool tables in the corner.
. There are chairs like the ones in a

high school cafeteria.
‘In the back of the building

A there's an open patio somewhat

nicer than Zelda's.

Well, a lot nicer than Zelda's.
No dumpsters in the corner or
anything like that. i

‘The patio was empty.
Then there was the dance floor.

 

   
 

Walking up to it, one just had
the feeling something was wrong.
No hip action whatsoever. The
good thing was, the students danc-
ing seemed to be happy, but they
looked so goofy. No one
screamed or yelled the words to
any of the songs.

If you happen to be a junior
and manage to sneak into the
place, there is one thing to worry
about. Getting caught.

It's not like things here, where
you just get embarrassed a little
bit, are thrown out and proceed to
find another bar to fake your way
into.

At the Notre Dame ”Senior Bar”
you pay a $100 fine, and the.
bouncer who let you in is fined-
also.

Talk about taking the fun right
out of college.

There was another thing about
the place that just didn't fit. The
guys outnumbered the girls by
about a zillion-to-one. This is
wonderful for the girls, naturally,
but what about the guys?

« DIRK
KAUFMAN

LOOKING BEYOND

Statistics at the university say
there are approximately three-and-
a-half males for every female at
Notre Dame.

After talking to one guy who
was spending Saturday night stud-

‘ ying in that building with the

golden dome on it which every-
one there loves so much, I came
to realize it's pretty upsetting for
the males. Again, the females
don't seem to mind it at all.

The poor guy talked about the
girl situation for about 30 minutes.
Listening to a lonely guy for this
longjcan get old pretty quick, but
here's part of what he said.

”Last year there was one girl a
bunch of us were chasing after all
winter. We thought she was
beautiful.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 15, 1986

’’When we came back after the
summer we realized she was,
well, fat. We couldn't believe all
of us were in love with the girl.”

This gentleman said the girls at
the school, and at nearby St.
Mary's, are extremely snobbish
and think the guys are ’’only after
one thing.”

”What we're looking for is com-

~ panionship,” he said. ”Most of us

aren't interested in anything more
than someone to spend time
with.”

Uh huh..

Since the guys can't seem to be
able to do this,'they drink a lot.
The campus population used to be
one of the highest per capita con-
sumers of alcohol‘ in the nation.

To stop this, the university
banned kegs from the campus.
Naturally, upon hearing this, one
must think, get serious.

It's true. No kegs. ‘

The guy I talked to said twice a
term the university allows these
huge parties to go on in each
dorm. Apparently the events go off

,Notre Dame students just don't dance too well

really big because the students
aren't allowed big-time drinking at
any other time.

Walking up the steps to one of
the dorms, I came across a
chaplain coming down — some-
thing I thought a bit strange.

I found out the guy lives on the
same floor with the students.

What fun.

Apparently, the students accept
all this as part of the Notre Dame
tradition. Part of that tradition in-
cludes winning football games,
which is something the Fighting
Irish have found a bit difficult of
late.

If the winning tradition of the
past isn't part of the future, how
much longer will the others last?

Ah, Notre Dame. Where the
men are men, the women are cold
and ruthless, and the football team
has won one game.

And they call themselves lucky.

ing to turn around another program
with three-point field goals.

VanHorne is Pitt's freshman place-
kicker. Since he has replaced Mark
Brasco in the Pitt lineup, the Pitt foot-
ball team has turned things around
sharply, partly because of VanHorne.
His 29-yard field goal in the waning
moments of the game gave Pitt three
points and a 10-9 victory over Notre
Dame this past weekend.

Biggest win of the season for tennis -

By Beth Froelich

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's tennis team is fly- _

ing high from an impressive victory
over West Liberty University.

The team was apprehensive about
the match because the West Liberty
team is one of the toughest on the
women's schedule. West Liberty
always gives Pitt a good test of their
competitive tennis prowess.

The Lady Panthers had nothing to
worry about though. They beat the
West Liberty team easily 8-1. By
securing the win, the team also
clinched a winning-season record of
7-3.

Leading the Lady Panthers in their
crowning victory was senior Jodi
Levine. In the No. 1 singles match,

Levine defeated Betty Bock of West
Liberty University in two straight sets
6-0, 6-3.

”This was a very surprising and
well-deserved win for the team. We
played well and gave our all,” said
Levine. ”The team has really im-
proved in the last few matches. We
are concentrating, and it shows when
we hit smart shots. It's all a matter of
thinking a shot through.”

Freshman Tracy Feltingoff con-
tinues to add to her collegiate tennis
wins. Her latest victim was Tammy
Townsend of West Liberty, whom
she downed 6-3, 7-6.

”We were all playing at the top of
our games against West Virginia,”
said Feltingoff. ”We worked hard and
were psyched for the match. I defi-
nitely feel that the confidence we are

gaining now will carry over into the
Big East Championships.”

Stephanie Nelson is always a
strong player for the Pitt women's
tennis team. She proved this once
again by beating Linda Valla of West
Liberty University easily 6-3, 6-4.

Nelson commented, ”After the
match I felt I could have played a lot
more aggressively. I made too many
mistakes in my singles match.

”Winning against a good team like
West Liberty and securing a winning
season will give us needed con-
fidence going into the West Virginia
match. Not only will we have a bet-
ter attitude and more confidence go-
ing into the Big East Championships
this year, but I think our team has a
lot more depth this year also.”

Consistent winner junior Carrie
deVera had a bit of a workout in the
West Liberty match. In the No. 4
singles match, deVera went for three
sets with Tammie Keller before
defeating her 5-7, 6-2, 6-2.

First-year player Bonnie Kartzman
suffered the only team loss of the day
in the No. 5 singles match. Kartzman
played a competitive match,
although she was edged out 6-4, 7-5
by Renee Bacha of West Liberty.

Rounding out singles action was
sophomore Karen Meade. Meade
played a very tight game of tennis,
only allowing her opponent the op-
portunity to score a few points off
her. Meade won the match easily 6-1,
6-2 in two straight sets against Kristy
Farrel of West Liberty.

The Pitt women's tennis team was
equally dominating in doubles play,
where they shut out the West Liber-
ty squad.

Levine and Feltingoff defeated
West Liberty's Bock and Valla 6-0,
6-4 in the No. 1 singles match.

Pitt's close-knit doubles team of
Nelson and deVera played well,

When Pitt entered Big East com-
petition last year, Smith was con-
sistently double or triple-teamed by
the opponent. He still averaged over
15 ppg and eight rpg, but he was not
the same Charles Smith.

’’It was real frustrating,” Smith ad-
mitted. ”I hated it — especially
against teams like Syracuse and Seton
Hall. They really collapsed on me.
Last year, Curtis and Demetreus
[Gore] would hit the shot, but they
would still [let] them shoot and col-
lapse on me.

’’It’s different this year,” he added.
’’If Curtis hits the jumper, they will
have to play him and deny him the
ball because it is worth three points
this year. That will open things up for

me. My opportunity to score and get
open will be much better.”

Aiken, a 6-0 native of Buffalo, N.Y.,
recalls what happened last year vivid-
ly. He knew he would have to shoot
the ball consistently this year for the
Panthers to be successful, but when
he heard the NCAA was installing the
three-point rule, he had added in-
centive.

”As soon as I heard about [it], I
started working on it,” Aiken said. ’’I
did not realize it was going to be that
short [191/2 feet] though. I was
shooting from the pro distance, 24‘/2
feet. It was trouble at first, and when
I finally adjusted, I found out it was
only 19‘/2 feet.”

While he was practicing his shot,
he was shooting with his new coach
in mind.

”When I shot last year, I shot with
a hand in my face,” Aiken said. ”I
remember watching Navy last year.
They had a guard like me, and every
time he shot, he was open. If Coach
can do that with me, I can have a
good shooting year.”

Aiken suffered through two
mediocre seasons his first two years
at Pitt, but he bounced back last year,
shooting 57 percent from the field.
He was dazzling in several games
and was even named Sports II-
lustratedPlayer of the Week once in
January following a 23-point perfor-
mance in a 78-75 loss to St. John's
and a 22-point effort in an 81-66 vic-
tory over Seton Hall.

— that was all. We could help him
in that area. I thought during the
Georgetown game [an 80-76 Pitt vic-
tory in which Aiken scored 18 points]
he really turned the corner. He shot

well, and he passed well.

”He just had to be told that he was
the best shooter in the Big East,”
Calipari added. ”Now when he
shoots, he thinks the ball is going to
go in. If you get him an open shot
within 18 feet of the basket, he will
hit that shot 65 percent of the time.
He is the best shooter in the Big

The Lady Panther volleyball team
finished first in their own Pitt Invita-
tional this past weekend.

Pitt defeated St. Francis 15-0, 154,
15-0 and dropped conference rival
Seton Hall 15-0, 15-2, 15-8. Then,
Pitt preceded to beat Youngstown
State 15-1, 15-2, 15-1.

Pitt faced St. Francis in the semi-
finals in three games. In the cham-
pionship match, the Lady Panthers

 ?

easily defeated Youngstown State
again 15-1, 15-9, 15-1.

The Lady Panthers, now 18-5 and
7-0 in Big East play, have won their
last 27 games in a row. Going into
last night's action with West Virginia
and Duquense, Pitt hoped to extend
their winning streak to 33.

The Lady Panthers played very
consistently in the tournament.
Coach Collier noted, ”We were‘ ex-
tremely strong, and everyone turned
in outstanding efforts.”

Starting setter Louise O’Shaugh-

nessey, who was considered for tour-
nament MVP, suffered a concussion
in the warm-up before the finals. She
was not supposed to play against Du-
quense or West Virginia last night. It
is not known if she will return to ac-
tion for either the Penn State or Ken-
tucky matches this weekend.

Freshman Lori Silk, however,
stepped in and handled the slot ve
well. 1

”Lori was very consistent,” said
Collier. ”For a freshman, Lori has a
real impressive, good sense of leader-

ship. She played to our advantage
during the final Youngstown State
match.”

The tournament MVP at the Pitt In-
vitational was Lady Panther Lisa
Stewart, while teammates Noreen
Coughlin and Sue Hoover were
selected for the all-tournament team.
Coughlin, against Seton Hall, had 12
kills in 14 attempts and only one
error.

Coach Collier pointed out, ”I was
very pleased with our performance
this past weekend. We played very

well in the [Fitzgerald] field house,
and I hope that trend will toIIow us
into our matches with Kentucky and
Penn State this weekend. We need
to make the most of our practices this
week if we expect to defeat the na-
tionally ranked Wildcats and Nittany
Lions.”

The Lady Panthers host the Univer-
sity of Kentucky Wildcats on Friday
at 7:30 p.m., and the Nittany Lions
will play in the Fitzgerald Field
House on Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Pitt
lost to Penn State earlier in the season

according to Weber.

”There were differences in what
we should work on. For example,
Leo worked on long passes, while Joe
prefers the short passing game,” he
said. ”Joe also expects more en-
durance. In his first year, we didn’t
use the weight room, but after the
next year, if you didn’t keep in con-
dition, you didn’t play. If you didn’t
work out during the off-season, Joe
didn’t look on you highly.”

The dedication Luxbacher
demands from his players also shows
a sense of discipline.

- ”On road trips, Joe talks about
representing the school, acting like
we are in college,” Webersaid. ”He
told us to dress like we aren't slobs,
act like we aren't kids.

”I don't think Leo impressed that
aspect on us."

”I think I was lucky,” Smith said.
’’I came in when a lot of the old
blood was going out. We had a good
team here my freshman year. Joe was
able to group everyone together.”

Pitt doesn't have the high-calibre
players that the top soccer colleges
in the nation have, but Luxbacher has
managed to blend the Panthers into
an cohesive unit.

”We don't have the outstanding
players,” Luxbacher said. ”The most
important thing when I recruit is find-
ing the players that can adjust to my
concept. We have good solid players
that make up for their lack of talent
by working hard and playing as a
team.

”Now, the players believe they can
win, and they have confidence in
themselves.”

With the success of the past three
seasons, Luxbacher has made‘ inroads
in- recruiting, especially in the
Western Pennsylvania area.

”We are trying to get the better
players from this area," Luxbacher
said. ”We have been fortunate to get
four players here that have helped
us.” '
Luxbacher said the arrival of junior
defenseman Dan Liberati has made
an impact on the team and in
recruiting. '

”Dan is our top defenseman and
the keystone of our team,” Luxbacher
said. ”Dan has the determination and
pride in himself to be a good player
— the type of player I look for when
I recruit. When Dan came to Pitt, he
set the tone as far as local recruits
coming here.”

Liberati was interested in top Divi-
sion I programs including Indiana
and Penn State.

”The offers from those two schools
weren't real good,” Liberati said.
-”They didn’t say I was going to get
a scholarship, but both Indiana and
Penn State wanted me to join the
team because of pride and just walk
on as a freshman. Joe was able to of-
fer me a package, and he kept his
promise.

”When Joe recruits a local player,
they know who I am from the youth
leagues. I've run into these guys

before.”

Luxbacher’s ties with high school
coaches have also helped in
recruiting players.

”I never saw Mark Hendricks [Pitt's
starting goaltender] play in high
school, but I knew his coach, Bill
Sterra, when I played with him with
Beadling [a local soccer club],” Lux-
bacher said. ’’Bill recommended
Mark to me.

”You sometimes recruit a kid in a
funny way.”

The future of Pitt soccer appears

. bright, even though Luxbacher said
the Panthers will, have a tough time I

returning to the Big East Tournament
from the Southern Division this
season.

”Seton Hall [who beat Pitt 4-0
Saturday night] has a Top 20 team,
and St. John's and Georgetown have

—improved,” he said. ”We also have

a tough schedule at the end of the
season.”

Pitt does have the potential to
become a strong Division I program,
according to Smith.

”Pitt has the biggest growth poten-
tial as far as college soccer is con-
cerned,” he said. ”We can offer a
great education, there are a lot of
great players in the area, and we have

the most respected coach on the East’

Coast.

”We have the resources to make
it into the Top 20.”

Lanza gaining respect on thesoccerfieldl

Sam Lanza and Rodney Danger-

mon. Last year, the two might have
been working toward the same goal,
but this year things have changed. In
one season Lanza has gained what
Dangerfield has been working
towards for an eternity — respect.
Lanza, a sophomore on the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh soccer team, went
through his first season trying to show
that he was worthy of being on the
field. After a year of hard work, the
Quaker Valley High School graduate
is now in the starting line—up and no
longer needs to prove his abilities.
”Last year I felt like I had to per-
form well to gain -the respect of the
other players,” the soft-spoken Lan-
za commented. "This year things are
different. I don't feel that I have to
prove myself anymore. I can just go

While he might not be trying to im-
press people, he has certainly
grabbed the attention of coach Joe
Luxbacher with his improved play
and is worthy of the praise his coach
bestows upon him.

”Sam hasyreally started to come on

for us,” Luxbacher said. ”He is gain-_
ing confidence. Not only is he able »

to score goals for us, but he is also
doing other things well.”

Lanza has been willing to make
sacrifices for the team. He started out
as an inside midfielder, but made the
successful transition to forward, a
position where his attacking ability is
a plus.

’’I’m getting more comfortable up
front,” Lanza stated. ’’It is definitely
a different role. I have my back to the
goal a lot. I'm getting used to it,
though.”

While Lanza's back may be to the
goal, his eyes are set firm on the net,
and when the time comes he is
pointed in the right direction to fire

that in two games this season, once
in a 6-1 victory over St. Francis and
the other, which proved to be the
game winner, in a 3-2 win over
Vanderbilt. It was his goal in that se-
cond game that led the Panthers to
become champions of the Marshall
Tournament.

The Panthers have been highly suc-
cessful this year, posting a 7-2-1
record to date, and Lanza credits that
success to his teammates and coach.

”We have not reached our full
potential yet,” Lanza said. ”Defen-
sively, we have played sound, but we
need to score more goals. We play
well but just can't seem to score.

”Joe has done a great job. He has

a great influence on the players. ‘

Some players are not used to his
coaching style because he is not that
vocal, but I am not that vocal either.
It is a perfect situation for me.”
Lanza has had a lot of luck with his
coaches. It seems that he has been at
the right place at the right time. While

at Quaker Valley, he gained All-
WPIAL honors and was coached by
Gene Klein. Lanza's freshman year
was Klein's initial year, and they both
saw the program grow into a power-
house in four years.

”Genejreally turned the program
around,” Lanza said in praise of his
former coach. ”He really helped me
out. I would never be here at Pitt if
it were not for him. He was the one
who, early on, got me interested in
Pitt and them interested in me.”

Irish
seniors _
digging in
§.Z,.?£?.'fi.,T

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — The luck of
the Irish seems to be running out.

Notre Dame is 1-4 in 1986 — the
victim of one blow out and three very
close defeats, games that could easi-
ly have gone in Notre Dame's favor.-

In the season opener with
Michigan, Notre Dame lost 24-23,
after completely dominating the
Wolverines statistically and finding
themselves on the short end of a very

_ questionable call which cost the Irish

a touchdown.

The next week Notre Dame again

found themselves losing a tight game,
this time to Michigan State.

After destroying Purdue and then
getting dogged by" Alabama, Notre
Dame was to play host to Pitt, a team
that, like Notre Dame, has had its
share of bad luck this season.

Pitt lost to Temple a week earlier
in a rain-soaked festival of mediocri-
ty. On paper, Pitt-Notre Dame
seemed like a game neither -team
could win. And in the end it almost
turned out that way.

Both teams played mistake-filled
games, each handing the other
numerous chances to put the game
away, neither team able to do it. In
the end, Pitt won because of a
blocked punt and a missed field goal.
Not the stuff of a great athletic en-
counter, but good enough for Pitt,
whose slim bowl game chances are
still alive with the win. ’

Both schools are undergoing a
rebuilding process, although Pitt at
3-2-1 may be constructing a little
faster than Notre Dame.

”This was an extremely depressing
loss for our football team,” Irish
coach Lou Holtz, said after the game
in a slow, southern drawl. One look
around the Notre Dame locker room
wou|d.have borne Holtz out com-
pletely.

’’Until we get everybody playing
together ...” Wally Kleine said at his
locker, speaking in a voice barely

-above a whisper. ”I don't know. I

mean, we try. A lot of things add up
— mental errors; Pittsburgh's a good
team. We've got Air Force next. week,
and I'll be damned if I'm going to get
down for that one. We're gonna
come back and play harder.

”But let me tell you something. I'm
gonna be 7-4 my senior year.”

Kleine was not the only Notre
Dame player in the dressing room
with a sense of mission. Quarterback
Steve Burlein echoed K|eine’s
remarks. '

”|’l| tell you what,” Beuerlein said,
”this senior class does not want to go
out as losers. We think we're a pret-
ty good football team. And we do
have a lot of confidence. Ourrecord
hasn't shown it yet, but we do.

”And Lou Holtz is a good coach.
Anybody who knows anything about
football knows that. He's been suc-
cessful in the past, and he'll be suc-
cessful here.”

The senior class notwithstanding,
it is entirely likely that the Irish will
wind up with a losing record. It will
be their second in a row.”I'his season
could wind up as being the lrish’s
worst since they were 2-7 in 1963.
The prime reasons for that are the
lack of a great quarterback and an of-
fensive line, a new coaching staff
and, the most obvious reason of all
— Notre Dame's schedule.

A comparison of the schedules of
four major independents shows that
Notre Dame's schedule is far more
challenging than those of Pitt, Penn
State and West Virginia.
