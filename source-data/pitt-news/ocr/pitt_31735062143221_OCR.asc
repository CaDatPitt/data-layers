Housing Group
To Maintain
Former Policy

The faculty housing committee
voted unanimously at .its Tuesday
meeting to stand by the policy
decided upon last August.

In the original report, dated
Aigust 20, the committee recom-
mended to the Chant-elloi that
the University refrain from at-
tempting to erect any temporary
housing facilities on its proper‘ty.

Holding that the space available

u as limited, the faculty members
concluded that this ;iace-imight
best be used for the expansion of
classroom and laboratory facilities.
They also .el.. that such housing
units as the school migh‘@p1'o-
cure could be used to greater ad-
vantage in schools where lack of
housing is limiting enrollment.
‘ The Tue.~-tlay meeting was called
by Theodore'VV. Biddle, dean oi
men and chairn.-an oi the com-
niittee. to learn if the committee-
men felt that their policy was still
wise in the light of recent de-
velopments

Not only did the committee re-
iterate
voted ‘not to"'recomme1id two new
‘propos.als. The first of these two
plans asked the University to rent
or buy vacant‘ lots. -md erect
tl mporary dwellings on them. The
second proposed that the school
rent large houses nearby. and con-
vert them into- .1pa.rt.mei.ts for
married veterans and their i".uni,-
lies.

In rel'Lising torecommend either
plan the committee said that, in
its opinion, all the time, money

game 9/tang»! Made

, Pitt students have been crying since the ﬁrst week_ of
 school about registration procedure. At last, a comprehensive,
V‘ fairly painless system, in comparison with our last-exhausting
ordeal, has been dumped in our laps. It isn’t exactly what we
asked for, but it is the nearest compromise that we could ex-
pect in the short space of one semester, and it is a great step
i toward getting University registrations down to a science.

A The chief faulttsof the old system have, in the main, been
corrected by the new plan, which provides for: student-faculty
interviews before registration Week, ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-served ap-
pointments, and distribution of class-cards byifaculty members
‘Who are authorized tomake on—the-spot schedule changes.
Nemesis of previous registrattions, the necessitated shuttling
back-and-forth between advisors and distributors of class—cards,
ill "be eliminated under the new plan.

This new system,‘ asdescribed. in detail on the front page,
is _a challenge to the student body. University oﬁicials have pre- ‘
sented us with a workable plan. If we -fail to report for study
lists and subsequent interviews prior to registration week, we
are only defeating our own purpose, _

We hope, however, that before the system .is perfected,
graduating students will be given registering priority. When
this last detail has been worked out, registration will be as

Editor, Pitt News:

Since the appearance of Bill
Catrow’s appeal to vets to wake
up before they hang themselves
(and I’m speaking aboutithe ones
for whom the shoe ﬁts) there has
been much .comment. And it
wasn’t good, at least not what I
read. So. I’d like to go on record
as one Pitt vet who agress whole-
heartedly with Catrow, and I nev-
éri met the guy, either.

Until people quit belly-aching
about what they haven’t got, and
start thanking God for what they
do have,‘ Pitt students will be
forced to read such juvenile
drivel from men such as Golight—
vly. There are too many scoffers,
fence - sitters, and hangers - on
squatting on the sidelines at this
{University anyhow. The quicker
we rid ourselves of the “gimme”
boys, the better.

A Four-Line Fault

So Mr. Catrow fouled up the
§fa_c,ts‘]' onwho asked for street-car
C’ asses for whom. That took only
our lines-—is that the only thing
{in the whole column you could
d to quibble about? Workmas-
er’s letter at least showed a lit-
, e more sense in discussing the
matter.

Pitt is an obstacle course, I ad-
jmit. I’ve got to pay full fare on
e street-car when I commute
to. school. I go into the ‘fuck shop
-for lunch and sometimes my wife
eets me; most of the time we
;can’t ﬁnd a place to sit. My back
is prematurely bent because I
have to carry those encyclopedia-
gsized law books with -me all day
and the baby around all night.)
locker is as scare as :1 ’45 Ford.

Room To Spare

The athletic department comes
ut with some crack—oot idea
bout “fair listribution of seats
,1‘ basketball ‘games. So I dash

to the. pavilion to find. seats for

   
    
  
   
 

 
  

    

     
  
 

-(Editor’s note: We would like to request once more that letters to
the editor be limited to 300 words or less, or approximately six inches
of print. It will be impossible in the future to print letters of any

wife and I ‘can’t go to the next
game because my ticket is punch-
ed. We,‘ hope Homer enjoys the
games.

(Editor’s note: See “New Ticket
Exchange” story on page 7.)

Things are rough. ‘.-:re, our
street-car stop school doesn’t
have must to offer us, but it’s a
damned sight better than I hoped
for over in Roku Roshi, and I’m
willing to make‘ the most of ‘it.

Chiang Kai-shek, in a letter to
J. Leighton Stuart, ambassador to '
China, commended the University
of Pittsburgh and other American
colleges for their contribution to-
ward the support of the thirteen
Christian colleges in China. ‘

The Generalissimo explained
that this help enabled Chinese
colleges to train expert techni-
cians and develop menof ideals
who_ will ﬁll important public po-
sitions.

The letter added that the need
for trained men is more urgent
than ever during China’s period
of reconstruction and restoration.
“It is my hope that those interest-=
ed will continue to raise funds so?

that with libraries and lost equip- _

ment replaced, operations in in-

YW, Continues

  Clothing Drive

. So many contributions have
been turned in to the YWCA since
the end of the food and clothing
drive that Mrs. Edna T." Batz, di-
rector of the YW, announced that
they will continue accepting do-
nations. These will be forwarded

to the Am-eric-an Friends Service

committee at the end of each
month.

As a result of December’s drive,
seven boxes of clothing and one
of food were sent to Europe. The
entire shipment went to Greece,
but now contributions can be sent
to_ any general area" that the donor
wishes.

Mrs. Batz stated, “If you attach
your name and a-ddress -to your
gifts, in most cases, the person
who gets it will reply. The idea

is ‘not to receive pers-onal credit,

but to further good will between
nations through individuals.”
Any person who wants to con-
tribute may take donations to the
YWCA office, 1204 Cl., any time
during the r/est of the school year.

Reporter Frank Langsdale, an ex-AAF cadet, takes the Univer-
sity’s Link trainer for a trial spin. The trainer, part of Pitt’s aviation
program, is located on the ground floor of the Cathedral.

Co-ed‘ Instructs Pilots
In Ground Floor ‘Link ’

K by Frank Langsdale
The tired pilot eases back in his seat as he follows the steady
hum in his earphones. He is “on the beam” to an unknown airport.
He radios ahead, requesting permission to land, and soon a lovely
feminine voice interrupts the hum to say, “You are now cleared.”
An amber light ﬂashes on the instrument panel, indicating that

the airport is only ﬁve miles away, and our pilot cuts the throttle,

gliding to a perfect landing. Switches click and the motor stops as
he lifts the hood and steps out--onto the ground ﬂoor of the Cathe-

dral of Learning.

Impossible you say? Not at all-—when that pilot is ﬂying the
“Link” trainer that is located behind Locker room No. 2 on the

ground ﬂoor. This is one plane
that doesn’t go anywhere, but
simulates ﬂight so closely it is
used to. teach pilots to ﬂy by in-
struments. It has been at the Uni-
versity since last semester and is
part of Pitt’s extensive aviation
program.

iThat “lovely feminine Voice”
belongs to Mrs. J .' W. Cartus, a
bacteriology major and an ex-
wave, who, during the war in-

structed Naval pilots in the Link A

at Vero Beach, Florida. Her hus-
band, a former ﬂight engineer on
a B-17, is an aviation. major and
is one of Mrs. Cartus’ best stu-
dents. C
iThe Link class, intended pri-
marily for ex-military or com-
mercial pilots, is a one-c\redit
course covering 10 one-hour in-
struction periods. There is an ad-
ditional arrangement whereby a
pilot, who needs brushing up for
an instrument rating, can take
time in Half,-hour sections at $3
per half hour. H

The coed-instructor explains
that ﬂying the Link, with its co-
ordinated group of bellows, mo-
tors, and relays, comes’ closest to
the actual “feel” of ﬂying a real

/ plane. _ »

The $8000 miniature plane will
accurately perform spins, stalls
and any other acrobatics that do
not require inverted ﬂight. On
the instructor’s control desk, a set
of duplicate instruments and a
three-legged metal contrivance
called a “crab” trace the pilot’s
course on an “approac ” diagram.
The Link will “cruise” at 160 mph
and climb at 120. ‘

Link training has become so im-
portant in instrument instruction
that the Civil Aeronautics admin-
istration ‘now allows a pilot ap-
plying for an instrument rating to
have half his time in the Link.

The price of instrument time in
an actual plane would cost the
student: at least‘$20 an hour.

Stdent ‘Congress Plas
Suggestion Committee

“Student response to the Suggestion Box has been most gratify-
ing,” stated Marshall Levy, Student congress president, after ad-
journment of this week’s congress meeting. “The more constructive
suggestions received, the more constructive action we can take.” '

A new set-up for the home basketball games was a~major topic,
as was the touchy subject of semi-formal dances. Students also feel
there is room for revision on the ruling of corsages at dances. ‘

Housing Group

(Continued from page 1)
should be devoted to finding a so-
lution of its most pressing prob-
lem—-shortage of clas.rooms and
equipment—so that the maximum
students from the Pittsburgh area
may be served.

“Housing, says the committee, is
essentially the problem of the in-
dividual veteran.

The University has never
promised any student a place to
live,” said Mr. Biddle. “We told
students when they applied for
admission, that we had no hous-
ing facilities to offer. We feel
that our ﬁrst duty‘ is to increase
our capacity to educate.”

The faculty housing committee
was _ appointed by Chancellor
Fitzgerald about a year ago. It
serves as an advisory board to
the chancellor in determining
school policy on housing. Mem-
bers of the committee include:
Miss Helen P. Rush, dean of
women; Vincent W. Lanfear, dean

of the School of Business Admin-

istration; Leland D. Baldwin, as-
sociate professor of history, W.
Irwin Short, associate professor
of civil engineering; G. S. Rupp,
assistant treasurer and bursar;
John Weber, secertary of the
University; William F. Saalbach,
assistant dean of men. ’

High-Pressure Synthesis Opens New.

A Challenge to Research Men
I and Engineers .

The use of techniques involving pres-
sures up to and above 1,000 atmospheres
(15,000 lbs. per sq. in.) has had a tre- .
mendous inﬂuence on chemical manu-
facture in the past twenty-ﬁve years.
The availability of unlimited quanti-
ties of nitrates via ammonia from nitro-
gen of the air by high pressure synthesis
has greatly aﬁected chemical economics

as well as agriculture.

The plastics industry, too, has bene-
ﬁted greatly by the reduction in price
of urea from about 80¢ lb. to less than
493, and methanol (to give formalde-
hyde) from $1.25 gal. to less than 25¢.

High pressure syntheses have also par-
ticipated in a major way in the devel-
opment of entirely "new products such
as nylon and polythene. In fact, starting
from coal, air and water, Du Pont now
makes over 120 widely used products.

In addition to improving the existing
processes of manufacturing ammonia,
methanol, higher alcohols, urea and
other important chemicals, Du Pont

, organic and physical chemists, chemi-
-cal, mechanical and metallurgical engi-
neers have discovered and developed
high pressure syntheses for the follow-
ing: ethylene glycol; hexamethylene
diamine; acetic, propionic and hydroxy-
acetic acids; methyl formate; C.-, C",-
and C.,.- alcohols; and numerous others.

Advantages and_ Problems

The use of high pressures offers numer-
ous advantages familiar to technical
students, such as: (1) forcing an equi-
librium in the direction of a Volume de-
crease, (2) overcoming the reversing
effect of high temperatures in exother-
mic reactions, (3) increasing reaction
and through-put rates and (4) provid-
ing, in some cases, a liquid phase which
might not otherwise be present.

The synthesis of urea from carbon
dioxide and ammonia is a good illus-
tration of some of these principles:

-—)

co, + 2NH_, ‘__

With three moles of reactants and only
two of resultants, increase of pressure
gives an expected increase in conversion.

 

CO (NH2)2 + H20

 

Essay Contest
Prizes Large

Three thousand dollars in prizes
will be awarded each year to
college students submitting the
best essays in an annual contest to
be sponsored by the Tamiment
Social and Economic institute.

A first prize of $1500, asecond
prize of $750, and three prizes of
$250 each constitute the winners’
takes.

“Roads to Industrial “Peace”
will be the subject for the Insti-
tute’s first contest. The purpose of
this award is to stimulate college
students to constructive thought
on matters of social and economic

importance.
The contest is open to all under-
graduate college students, and

each contestant may submit. only

At the same time, the gaseous reactants
are forced into the liquid phase to give
higher concentrations and again better
conversion. The reaction rate and there-
fore the rate of passage through the re-
action chamber are both increased by
increasing the temperature under high
pressure conditions. There are other
equilibrium considerations that aﬁ'ect
the industrial production of urea, but
they are too lengthy to discuss here.

Along with its advantages, the use of
high pressure gives rise to problems that
often severely tax the abilities of engi-
neers and chemists. For example, (1)
difliculties of design of packing glands,
valves, connecting rods, closures, etc.,
increase rapidly with increased pres-
sure, (2) extraordinary corrosion prob-
lems arise in which even stainless steels

ordinary steels are permeable to hydro-
gen at higher pressures and tempera-
tures. These are but a few illustrations
of the‘ challenge that high pressure
studies present to the technical man
and particularly to the metallurgical
and mechanical engineer.

High pressure synthesis has now be-

istry with an apparently limitless future.

In Brief -Unspoken Episode I ’

Catrow

The morning had the crispness common to winter. Campus grass
was still white with frost and an overcast sky gave emphasis to the

forlornness of the season.

With measuredlstep a blind boy advanced along the Fifth avenue /

5ideVV31k- To him the day's beginning may have been in\'igorating
——the briskness connoting a joy in merely being alive, the currents
in the air murmuring, “Life is good; you can be happy.”

The boy may have realized thatt
he was passing the Cathedral of
Learning, _a lofty monument to
education and intellectual integ-
rity, or he may have been pacing
blindly just another block along
a route known only by irregular
spots in the surface under foot.

A barricade
hol-e which held the new steam
transmission pipes, but a barri-
cade can ward off only those who,
by sight, take cognizance of its
presence.

From the opposite direction ap-
proached a man of rich but con-
servative attire, unspectacular but
impressive in that his bearing be-
spoke an interest in all that is ex-
istence.

Almost imperceptibly he length-
ened his stride so as to reach the
far side of the barricade before
the boy plodded doggedly into the
structure that had no place in an
orderly scheme of things.

>

surrounded 4 the _

Taking theilad b;the arm, the
portly gentleman led him to the
street and around the barricade to
a place where the pavement re-
sumed its normal regularity. Few
words were spoken between the
two. I

They parted and the boy trudg-
ed on, thankful to a man who
might have been an ofﬁce clerk. a
college student, a hotel manager,
or a street sweeper. Unseeing, he
could know nothing of the ap-

pearance of the man but only the
nature measured in terms of hu-
man kindness. The actors will

soon have forgotten the incident,-

but all who watched this drama of
generosity will remember it as a
pantomime which symbolized the
spirit that is Pitt.

wards the Cathedral to disapepar _.

DAN GER-—ZONE

The recent win over Penn State by “Doc” -C'arlson’s “Win Them
All—in ’47” courtmen still provides a warm topic of conversation for
the student body. ~

Any victory over the Nittany Lion, whether it be on the grid-
'iron or the tic-tac-toe court, provokes more than the usual amount
of excitement on the Oakland campus. It certainly can’t be attributed
alone to State’s formidability as an opponent, especially on the bas-
ketball ﬂoor. However the proximity of the schools plus the fact
that rivalry has always been clean makes a Penn State—Pitt match
something to behold.

Althought it was deﬁnitely a Carlson-coached ﬁve that trounced
the men of Nittany, the victory cannot be considered a triumph for

in the Pitt system this year is that there is to be
no shooting unless from under the hoop, via the
hook and layup method.

The contest had not yet grown old when the
Pittmen began to realize that there would be no
trespassing through the network of long arms and
legs that constitute the famed State zone defense.
It was somethime during the second period that
the Panthers forgot their orders and commenced
ﬁring from long range.

However lets not consider the move a case
of mutiny for that it wasn’t. Much more diplomatic
terminology is in order, perhaps “Floorman’s
Choice” will serve the purpose.

Fortunately for the Blue and Gold, diminutive Nate Apple was
sizzling. The Pitt captain blazed away from center court, the sides,
and from down under, and unerring accuracy caused 18 points to
pass through the cords. This provided the impetus for the Pittmen to
gain the victory. ' ,

It will be interesting to see what mode of attack Carlson will
use when the two clubs tangle at State College on Feb. 1. Although
State’s offensive guns appear woefully weak, their zone is effective
enough to halt the Panthers if they adhere to their battering. ram
type of offensive. . , ‘

“LONG JAWN” RETURNS

Track fans, far and near, will watch with unwonted interest the
coming indoor season in the East. For returning to competition again
for the ﬁrst time in many year’s, is Pitt’s incomparable John Wood-
ruff, 440 and 880-man supreme. Early last Spring, certain members
of Pitt’s track team were afforded an opportunity to talk with “Long
Jawn” while they were in New York for a meet. He seemed to in-
timate, at that time, that he would be interested in competing in the
1948 Olympic Games. So the long-legged vet starts back on the come-
back trail against aﬁeld of youngsters he could have beaten under
three-quarters speed in his prime.

WHAT’S MORE IMPORTANT

An innovation in college basketball locally this year is the prac-
tice of ‘staging two 20-minute halfs rather than the conventional 10-
minute quarters. All Pitt games this year will probably be played
under those time conditions and it is being treated with disfavor by
the players. The primary complaint is that it robs them of two badly
needed rest periods. ‘It has been ‘adopted as another measure to
speed up the game for the spectator. Isn’t it about time’ they give
the game back to the players? I .

Pitt Olympic Star
In Competition Again

‘ ‘Long John” \Voodruﬁ‘,

na.tionally-famous track star

from Pitt, has announced that he is planning to run again after

a six-year layoff.

The former Pitt ace expects ‘to compete in the half-mile
run in the Columbus Council Knights of Columbus games at
Brooklyn tomorrow night. The 31-year old comet from Connells-

ville, Pa. will probably encounter‘?

stiff tests at Gotham on Saturday
from Stanton Callender of New
York university, the indoor I-C-
4A 1000-yard champion, and
Fordham’s Joe Nowicki.

In 1936, Johnny captured the
half—mile meet in the Olympic
games at Berlin. While enrolled
at Pitt, he probably copped as
many individual records as any
collegian ever has during four
years of track competition. Wood-
ruﬁf also holds cinder conquests
in meets in France, Norway and
Japan.

After graduating from the Uni-
versity in 1939, the long-striding
athlete ran for a year independ-
ently; then, retired‘ from active
competition, later he entered the
Army and before being released

recently, he had been elevated to
the rank of captain.

Aside from a few exhibitions,
John has not raced since 1940.
This coming test will determine
whether the great Woodruff of the
late 3-0’s has lost any of his daz-
zling speed during the seven-year
lapse.

Hagan Sets Up
Ticket Plan

Athletic Director James Hagan
has announced that, due to the
number of unused tickets to the
Penn state basketball game last
Saturday night, there will be ‘a
change in the ticket distribution
policy.

The change, which will go into
effect for the Ohio state tilt on
January 20, is that the ﬁrst day
the tickets are released for ex-
change, they will be reserved for
th-ose who did not see the West-
minster game on January 13th.
Then, on the second and third
days, the entire student body will
be able to secure ducats.

Under no circumstances will
tickets be exchanged on the night
of the game.

lMr. Hagan also revealed that of
the 2000 tickets made available to
the students for the Penn state
game, only 1459 tickets were used,
250 of these being distributed at
the Stadium.

Headquarters for both men and
women’s exchanges will be at the
bookstore.

‘The Place To Meet and Eat

by John Golightly

_Hoping to continue the winning trend, Pitt hops oif for
their twentieth meeting with Army at \Vest Point Saturday

afternoon.

Hearteiieﬂd by their improved passing and effective de-
fense, the Panthers are hoping to bring back their ﬁrst win

over the Pointers in four years.

Panthers Druh
Carnegie Tech

In addition to a 60-22 spank-
ing, Tech’s Tartans are suffering
from a case of the hives. Wednes-
day night, Doc Carlson turned
loose his swarming Panthers and
they buzzed in, ov-er, and around
the helpless Tartans.

. At the end of the ﬁrst period,
Pitt was on the top rung by a
12-5 margin. But it was lithe
Sammy David who started the
rout.

He replaced Wally Zernich and
before the half was up dumped in
four baskets and a pair of fouls
to increase the Panther advantage
to 26-10.

This failed to satisfy Nate Ap-
ple. Through-out the third stanza,
black-that-ched Nate pumped in
lay ups, set sh-ots, and tip ins. For
the second time he topped all
scorers with 19 points.

Meantime the dutiful Tartans
continued to bring the ball up
court. What passes the hustling
Panthers di-dn’t intercept were
thrown wildly into the crowd. Oc-
casionally, Tech let ﬂy with a few
wild heaves which sometimes
landed near the basket — within
six feet, that is.

CAGE SLANTS . . .

Dodo Canterna chipped in with
some dazzling set sh-ots. His 11.5
average per game tops the Pan-
ther scorers.

Cecconi registered his ﬁrst
marker for Pitt. Aggressive Bimbo
dropped a free throw with 45 sec-
onds remaining.

The Bob Artman-coached Pan-
ther JV’s won their first outing,

blasting Tech’s “Bees,” 30-15.

Pitt copped a verdict in 1943.

‘Since then the Cadets won each

contest by at least 14 points.

Cadets Untested

Pitt is far ahead on game ex-
perience. Army opened with
Swarthmore Wednesday n i g h 1:
while the Panthers have six games
behind them. The Cadet lineup is
ﬁlled by ex-gridders Jim Rawers,
Bob Folsom, Arnold Tucker, Bar-
ney Poole, and Hank Foldberg.

Army’s lack of game experience
plus being held to limited work-
outs by late arrival of the ex-grid-
ders offers Carlson’s rolling Pan-
thers a ﬁne opportunity to catch
the Cadets off base.

Meet Tall Titans

The towering Titans from New
Wilmington drop anchor at the
pavilion Monday night. Sparked
by Chet Dembinski and Bill Me-
Lhinney, Westminster has waded
through nine games. They sport a
seven win, two loss record, and
rank seventh in the district.

Dembinski and McLhinney both
average 12 points per game. Tallest
man is Fred Paine, -vi}: foot, six-
inch guard. Don Heddleston at for-
ward and playmaker Tom Jones
at guard complete the quintet.
Westminster’s height average is
six foot, two inches.

Reserves Air Attack

Ability of Panther reserves Sam
David, Lou Cecconi, and Frank
Morris to ﬁt into the starting line-
L.p has aided the Carlson upswing.
Their improved play has been the
bright spot in recent victories.

Pitt’s lineup for both games will
have Dodo Canterna and Bill Cie-

ply paired at guard, Jack Boose _

at center, and Captain Nate Ap-
ple and Wally Zernich running at
forward.
