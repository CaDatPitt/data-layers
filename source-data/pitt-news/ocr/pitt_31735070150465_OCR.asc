Dean Humphrey inspires students to

Sean Corrado
Stcgj’ Wrz’ter

Pitt’s Dean of Students and Vice Provost
Kathy Humphrey agreed to trade in her
trademarkskirt suit for a T-shirt and a pair
of running shoes to participate in a 5K run
this Saturday, but her preparation to reach
the ﬁnish line has been anything but easy.
“I had no idea what I was saying yes to,”
Humphrey said. “I am doing something way

V outside my comfort zone.”

In an effort to raise awareness for the
Healthy U initiative, Humphrey will partici-
pate in the ZooZilla 5K Run/Walk on Satur-
day morning at the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG
Aquarium. She wants her presence at the
race to inspirestudents to live a healthy life
now and to develop healthy habits for the
future. Healthy U is a sector of Pitt’s Student
Affairs Department that focuses on helping
students “maintain more than just optimal
physical and emotional health.”

Senior Julie Hallinan, a member of
Pitt’s Student Government Board and of
the Healthy U 5K Committee, looked for
someone on campus to engage students and
get them excited to take part in the 5K that
Pitt now sponsors. She thought to herself,
“who would be abetter role model than the
dean of students?”

Originally, Humphrey said she thought
that Hallinan wanted her to attend the event
and cheer on students at the ﬁnish line. But
when the directors at a staff meeting con-

NEWS 

vinced her that running would get students

excited about the race, she wasn’t in a posi- '

tion to say no.

According to Hallinan, Humphrey’s
promise to run inspired many students to
join the 5K on the hilly terrain of the Pitts-
burgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium.

“She’s deﬁnitely made an impact,” Hal-
linan said. “Many students have been mo-
tivatedto get out there and do something
fun and healthy as a community?’

Along with Humphrey, more than 100
Pitt students are registered to race at 8 a.m.
Saturday morning. '

But working toward this day has proved

‘no easy task for Humphrey. Humphrey has

not previously found success in athletics,
and she admitted that her worst grades in
school from kindergarten on were in physi-
cal education.

Nevertheless, Humphrey made apromise
to Hallinan and the 5K committee to run
in the event, and she is not one to break
promises.

Starting in early October, Humphrey
trained with John Schneider, Pitt’s coor-
dinator of outdoor recreation, every Mon-
day, Wednesday and Friday morning before

started her off easy with some interval train-
ing. She had to repeatedly run for a minute
and then walk for a minute. This would be
a relatively simple task for an athlete, but

for someone who does not enjoy running, ,

' it would hit very hard.

“I thought like Iwas going to die,” Hum-
phrey said. “I am one of those people who
wants to stop running the second-I feel pain.”

Sherealized shehad much more work
to do to be physically prepared for the 5K.
The beginning was a struggle, but she used
her students as her motivation to improve.

“I was convinced I would be a good model
for those students who are not physically
active,” said Humphrey, who did not miss
a single training workout session.

Things began to get even worse when
Humphrey injured her knee during a work-

out, so Schneider altered the program to .

allow Humphrey’s knee to heal faster and
prevent her from re—injuring it.
Humphrey trained off her knee for a little"

. bit by working on the rowingmachine to

work. Schneider developed a workout regi- ‘

men that included cardio training, weight
lifting and core strengthening.
“I didn’t even know what.a core was,”
Humphrey said. ' ' ~
Humphrey also had no idea what she was
in for on her ﬁrst day of training. Schneider

Shawn Ahearn, Pitt’s Student Affairs of-

her work ethics in running shoes and dress
shoes.

“She is always pushing her students to
go beyond their limits,” Ahearn said. “Now,
she is going beyond her own.”

Humphrey is now conﬁdent that she will
ﬁnish the race. She has crafted a strategy to
work around the hilly course. If she runs all

-The home stretch of a horrible season

i Claire Eckroate 

Columnist

I can’t wait for next week to come
and go.

I have a lot of stuff going on, and
it’s stressing me out. Extracurricular
activities, papers to write, chapters
to read and research to do. But I’m

more interested in the end of this

presidential. election.

This seems strange coming from
a political science major who has
followed politics closely since before

i she was of a legal age to vote.

Naturally, I have a preferred
candidate. Naturally, I believe that,
if this man iselected, we would be
better off than ifthe other ischosen.
But really, I’ll be honest. I’m starting
to hate politics.

What has pushed me over the
edge and has driven me absolutely
insane during this election season
are the millions of links posted to
Facebook and the polarized tweets
from celebrities and my peers alike
about the election. The mudslinging
I’ve seen from both parties is simply
unbearable. . . -

We_knowas a general rule that

_ religion and politics should never

be the focusof dinner table discus-
sions or other polite conversation.
Why argue something when it’s a
different ﬁindamental belief forboth
sides? There is no way you, even in

1 ‘ your inﬁnite wisdom, will change
someone’s mind over spaghetti and ‘

meatballs. Though I’m sure you’re
_deﬁnitely the one who’s right, aren’t

- you?

This election season, the line

I between both of these subjects has

been considerably blurred. These

more often than not. And they’re

pitting people against each other.
Facebook posts with angry quotes or
religious verses displayed to prove
points, links to YouTube videos of
attack ads and overall snarky, often
ill—inforrned comments made from
both the red and blue sides attack
me daily. _ l

I know I have friends who have
different beliefs, backgrounds and
upbringings from myvown. We can
ignore these differences quite easily
under normal circumstances; we

‘have Democrats and Republicans

among us. When we go out for din-
ner or drinks, we talk about other
things — anything but politics —

_ no matter how much of a foreign

policy geek I might be. However,
everyonewears their affiliations on
their sleeves these days.

Why? When presidential elec-
tions roll around, everyone is sud-
denly a policy expert, an economist
and a source of facts on the state of
our nation. I am ﬁilly in support of
becoming educated on important
issues for one’s beneﬁt. I am also
in support of, more than anything,
everyone standing up for their own
beliefs.

But it’s these comment wars that
make my stomach churn. You don’t
need to prove your friends — or per-
fect strangers — wrong. Chances
are, they won’t see your point of View
as the truth anyway, no matter how
well you may craft your argument.

Just look at debatespeople start
on any Facebook post displayed on

"the official Mitt Romney and Barack

Obama pages. If you’re looking for
even scarier instances of bashing,
check out the oﬁicial pages of Bill
Maher or Rush Limbaugh. ‘

    

election, once the pre—election bash-
ing ends and the dust settles around
the results, can we agree to wish the
winner well for the next four years,
no matter how much you think he
should retire to his home state,
never to be heard from again in the
"political realm?

Because, in all honesty, there are
no further actions for us to take if
our preferred guy loses. The best
shot you’d have, based on what we
can learn in history classes, is work-
ing toward your party’s success in
the next legislative elections in two
years. Even then, you’re just going
to_have to wait.

Tell your friends of the other par-
ty “good game.” And mean it. Having
personally worked on campaigns, I
can tell you that it is unbelievably
hard. Rewarding and miserable, in-
spiring and frustrating. Both parties
have poured their blood, sweat and
tears into ensuring one candidate’s
success. But for one group, thatef—
fort will not be enough.

Bummer, right? Try to under-
stand how hard it is to lose when
the stakes are so high. Try to hold
back on the snide remarks. Try not
to rub it in someone’s face. Win or
lose, be gracious. But be brief about
it. In lnonpresidential election years,
like 2013, nobody wants to hear your
political ranting. I

On Nov. 7, we will wake up to
headlines detailing the results of
this year’s presidential election.
No matter who wins, there will be
a relative peace when, by the week-
end, the scathing online posts from
both sides will disappear. At least,
I hope so. I

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The last time the Pitt football team faced a
national—championship—seeking rival on the
road, one of the greatest upsets in college
football history ensued.

While the Panthers (4-4, 1-3 Big East)
aren’t as heavy underdogs as they were
against West Virginia leading up the famous
13-9 victory over the Mountaineers in 2007,
they still enter Saturday’s matchup at un-
defeated No. 3 Notre Dame (8-0) knowing
nobody expects them to shock the Fighting
Irish. The game will be played at 3:30 p.m.
local time and will be televised on NBC.

Pitt head coach Paul Chryst said that he’s
excited to head to South Bend for the op-
portunity to play one of the best teams in the
nation, but that he wants his football team to
stay calm and treat this game like any other.

“Emotion and keeping it in check is a big
part of it,” the ﬁrst—year head coach said at
his weekly press conference. “I don’t think
your approach is any different.”

. Chryst also said that playing in games like
this is one of the main reasons he decided to
come to Pitt.

“I think that’s the neat thing about Pitt —
it’s a part of some great series, and we get to
play this one this year,” he said. “I know I’m
pretty excited about it.”

Both teams enter Saturday’s showdown
— the 68th matchup between the two rivals
— coming off big wins.

The Fighting Irish demonstrated that they
want to be contenders for the national cham-
pionship as they crushed No. 8 Oklahoma on
the road, 30-13. Likewise, the Panthers routed
Temple, 47-17, notching their ﬁrst Big East

SPORTS  

win of the season. [V  

“Obviously, it was a good to get Satur-
day, and I thought a lot of .players impacted it,
and that was fun to see§i’r’i_Chryst said.

Pitt redshirt senior quarterback Tino Sun-
seri led an explosive offense in the Panthers’
win over the Owls, throwing for 321 yards
and three touchdowns as Pitt recorded an
impressive 528 total yards. _

After the game, Sunseri lauded the play
of his offensive line.

“We wanted to make sure that every time
we got the ball, that we would take advantage
_of it,?’ he said..“Obviously, the offensive line
played really well. You have to give a lot of
credit to those guys.”

Redshirt junior wide receiver Devin Street
ﬁnished with six catches for 140 yards and
a touchdown against Temple, but he knows
the Panthers need to improve if they want
to put up points when they face a daunting
Notre Dame defense. ‘

“I think we did some good things out
there, but there are deﬁnitely some things
we can improve on,” Street said. “We’ll go
back and watch the tape, but I think it’s just
going to be a huge week of preparation before
going in to South Bend. Notre Dame is a top-
ﬁve team, but we’ll get after it.”

If Pitt wants to pull off an upset, it will
likely need to win a low-scoring game. The
Fighting Irish’s defense hasn’t allowed more
than 17 points in a single game this season,

allowing an average of 9.9 points per game. 6

With the Panthers’ offense facing its stiff-
est challenge of the season, the Pitt defense
will need to keep N otre Dame’s offensive unit
in check. But that won’t be an easy task, es-
pecially after linebackers Dan Mason and
Manny Williams suffered season- ending inju-

ries in the Temple victory. Offensive lineman

Ryan Schlieper will also miss the remainder

of the season. _

With two of his better linebackers injured, ,

Chryst said the Panthers will have to make
some defensive adjustments.
“We’re going to make sure we’ve got it

covered,” he said. “We’ll have a couple.dif— 7

ferent plansandj just kind of see whereguys’
health is as we go forward.” O V ‘ V 

When those Panthers who are healthy
enough to compete run onto the Notre Dame
Stadium ﬁeld this Saturday -afternoon, their

jerseys will have a new feature to them,

Because of last week’s impressive per-
formance, Coach Chryst decided that it was
ﬁnally time to restore player names to the
back of jerseys. .

“I knew it was important to them,” Chryst
said. “I thought it was the right thing for this
group at this time, and also if we can give a
little bit of motivation, so be it.”

Chryst will now be hoping that his players
justify his decision by handing Notre Dame
the ﬁrst defeat of its season and giving the
Panthers their biggest win this season. I

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Taylor aims to grasp last chance to shine with Panthers

Brian Batko
Senior Stajf Wrz'Zer

When Dante Taylor left the Petersen
Events Center-Wednesday night, he looked
forward to going home and watching some
NBA action to relax and unwind from prac-
tice. _ , .

Just a few years ago, when Taylor entered
the -Pitt basketball program as a McDon-
ald’s All-American and a consensus top-15
recruit in the class of 2009, it would not
have been outrageous to think the senior

big man might be playing in one of those

NBA games instead.

But Taylor’s collegiate career up to this
point has been underwhelming. In three
years, he has averaged 5.0 points and 4.4
rebounds per game. He’s no longer found
in onlinemock drafts or rankings of top
college basketball prospects.

Going into his ﬁnal season with the Pan-
thers, though, none of that matters to ‘him.

“I never pay attention to the criticism or

' internet or things like that,” the Greenburgh,

N.Y., native said. “I never even read noth-
ing about no expectations. It was always,
I’d be in an interview with somebody and
they’d say,"Well, what do you think about

' [the expectations],’ and I’d just be like, ‘I

don’t know,’ because I’m not into stuff like

that. I don’t care.”

After underachieving inis first threeﬁyears with  mensietbaii team, forwa -

Dante Taylor hopes to have a big senior season with Pitt. Steve Garﬁnkeli For The Pitt News

“The No.‘ 1 person I care about is my
coach,” Taylor added. “If he don’t say noth-
ing negative, then I must be doing something
right.” i

Taylor can rest easy, as Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon had nothing but glowing praise
for him on the heels ofhis nine—point, 10-re-
bound effort in the team’s ﬁrst exhibition
game against Indiana (Pa.) last Friday.

“I thought he played really well the
whole game. I told the guys afterwards he

was probably the best player on the ﬂoor,”
Dixon said.

Trey Zeigler, a junior guard who has
known Taylor for the past six months since
he transferred to Pitt from Central Michi-
gan, echoes his coach’s sentiments about
his veteran teammate. _

“He’s been a leader, really. Being a senior,

he’s bringing that energy,” Zeigler said. “The '

biggest thing is he doesn’t care whether he
starts or not. He knows he’s going to play,

 

and he’s going to take advantage of his min-
utes, and I think he showed that in the exhi-
bition game. He’s going to take advantage of
whatever coach wants him to do.”

As a freshman, many Panthers fans
hoped the highly touted Taylor would beat
out then—returning junior center- Gary Mc-
Ghee for a spot in the starting lineup. He
didn’t. McGhee started the next two seasons
with Taylor as his primary backup.

Last season, as a junior, Taylor ﬁnally be-
came a starter. But he didn’t have the break-

out campaign Pitt followers hoped for, and -

the team missed‘ the NCAA tournament for
the ﬁrst time in 10 years.

Now, as a senior and an unquestioned
team leader, he’ll likely be relegated back to
reserve status to make way for ballyhooed
freshman Steven Adams —— a role that the
22-year-old Taylor is perfectly ﬁne with.

“I’ve never been the type of person to be
caring about if I start or anything like that,”
Taylor said. “I just know when I get in the
game, I just got to do what I got to do, and
that’s all that matters.”

Three weeks ago at-the team’s media day, l

Dixon said Taylor is as healthy as he’s ever
been to start the season. Taylor has battled
knee soreness and back pain throughout his

Youthful Pitt seeks improvement after miserable season

Megan Boyle
For The Pitt News

Forget about last season.

That’s the mentality of the Pitt wom-
en’s basketball team -as the Panthers enter
the upcoming 2012-2013 season, hop-
ing to recover from last year’s miserable
campaign. .

Redshirtjunior guard Abby Dowd be—_

lieves her team learned a lot from_ last
season and says it made the Panthers
eager to improve.

“No one wants to lose, and last year

f was difficult, but I think it motivated’

us and propelled us forward,” she said.
“It’s motivation-to get in the gym and get
some extra shots up. Losing, while it’s

, not ideal, there are things we did learn
from it. Last year happened, but I think ‘

it’s important to note we are not dwelling
on last season.”

After suffering a 0-16 conference re-
cord last season, head coach Agnus Bere-
nato entersvher 10th season in charge of
the Panthers with hopes that this will be
a much—improved team.

“We are‘ so excited about the upcom-
ing season,” Berenato said. “Last year
we had the youngest team in the nation
out of more than 350 teams. To be the

,a' ,3 . W1 '
. '.

coach Berenato is excited about her team
this season. Maia Woluchem | ForThe Pitt News

youngest is kind of daunting. We’re prob-
ably going to be in the top_five youngest
again, but I’m re_ally‘excited because we’re
a year older.”

Incredibly, for the second consecu-.

tive season, the Panthers will not have a
single senior on the roster, but with four
juniors and four sophomores with in-
game experience returning, Pitt should
finally have some continuity.

Dowd agreed, saying that the familiar-
ity between the players is helping team
chemistry.

’ “This year, I feel like everyone is very
confident and steadfast in their role on

the team, and they know what is expect-

ed of them,” Dowd said. “The chemistry
looks a lot better and feels ﬂuid. We are
very optimistic for theseason.”

With every key member of the team
returning, the Panthers enter this season
knowing who their go-to players are.

Returning sophomore guard Brianna .
_ . Kiesel is a favorite to shine on the court

this season. Last year, she led the team
with _13.6 points per game as a freshman.

Kiesel said she feels comfortable en- ,

tering this season as one of Pitt’s star
players.

“I feel a lot more confident this year,”
Kiesel said. “Coming in last year and hav-
ing a big role on the team, I was nervous
and excited. This year, those nerves have
gone away, and I am more conﬁdent in
myself and my team.”

Berenato also-made it very clear that

she wants Kiesel to be the leader of this
year’s Pitt women’s basketball team.

“I have said to her many times, ‘This is

your team. It’s not my team, it’s not Pitt’s
team, it’s not the community’s team, it’s
not Ashlee’s [Anderson] team or Abby’_s
team, but Bri, this is your team. You’re
the coach on the court,”’ Berenato said.
joining Kiesel in the backcourt, Dowd
and fellow redshirt junior guard Ashlee
Anderson will provide solid scoring op-
tions for the Panthers. Last season, An-
derson finished second on the team with
-10.6 points per game, while Dowd -— the
team’s 3-point specialist —— tallied 4.5
points per game. .

With ‘a talented core of guards and
forwards Kyra‘ Dunn and Chyna Golden
controlling the paint, Pitt’s starting line-
up will appear much more formidable to
opponents than it did last year.

But the keys to the Panthers’ success
this season could be staying healthy and
having quality depth. . '

Two of Pitt’s role—players — junior
guard Asia Logan and sophomore center
Cora McManus —- enter the season with
injury concerns. Both had surgery in the
offseason, but Berenato believes they’ll

Zeigler transferred to Pitt because
I of familiarity with program

Dave Uhrmacher
Stcyff Wrz‘ter

Trey Zeiglerwas thriving in his star role at Cen-
tral Michigan. _ <

Coming off a sophomore season inwhich he
averaged nearly 16 points and seven rebounds
per game and was the focal point for the Central
Michigan‘ squad, Zeigler was living up to the
top—75 recruit status he earned coming out of
high school; . -

But justas he was settling inwith the Chippe-
was, adversity struck. After an 11-21 (5-11 MAC)
season, the head coach of Central Michigan,
Ernie Zeigler — Trey’s father —— was relieved
of his duties. '

Followinghisfather’s ﬁring, Zeigler decided
to transfer out of Central Michigan. It didn’t take
much time for storied programs such as Duke,
UCLA, Michigan and Michigan State‘\to come
calling, and Duke appeared to be afront-runner.
Zeigler had turned the school down in favor of
playing for his father at Central Michigan just
two seasons earlier. '

Those schools pressed hard for Trey’s ser-
vices on the court, but they were all lacking one
thing Pitt was not: familiarity.

Zeiglerwas already somewhat aware of the
way the Pitt men’s basketball program operated
when making his transfer decision. Prior to
becoming the head coach at Central Michigan
in2o06, Ernie Zeigler had servedas anassistant
to Ben Howland — alongside current Pitt head
coachjamie Dixon— at Pittfrom 2001 to 2003.
During Ernie’s time here, Trey was fortunate
enough to develop a relationship with Dixon
and'then-star guard Brandin Knight, now an
assistant coach for the Panthers. ‘

“Knowing the coaches played a huge role,”
Zeigler said in an interview of his decision to

A transfer to Pitt. “Just steppingin and knowing it

was something I would be used to as far as how
things operate, plays, terminology, among other
things deﬁnitely played a factor.”

Soon after committing to Pitt, Zeigler re-
ceived a pleasant surprise.

» To the surprise of many college basketball
fans, the NCAA granted the shooting guard a
waiverto play immediately for the Panthers,
meaning Zeiglerwill not_have to sit out a year, as
most transfers are required to do by the NCAA.
In its decision, the NCAA made the determina-
tion_ that Zeigler’s decision to attend Central
Michigan was based solely on the fact that his

. , father was the head coach, and that he should

not be penalized for wanting to transfer.

“It was a blessing that they did allow me to
play,” Zeigler said. “And before I committed any-
where, I really didn’t know if playing this year
was an option, but I was happy with the ruling.”

Because of the special ruling, Zeigler will
have two years of eligibility remaining, as he is
a listed as a junior. ‘

Not accustomed to being in the national
spotlight at Central Michigan, Zeigler said he is
looking forward to the opportunity to display

.his talents against some of the country’s best

Trey Zeigler could start at shooting guard
for Pitt. Nishant Singh I Staff Photographer

teams inthe Big East. ,

“Looking at our schedule, we have so many
games on TV. Getting to play on the big stage is
going to be a lot of ﬁm,” he said. “BeforeI made

the decision to transfer, sitting there watching .
big games in the locker room and knowingl _

could compete in those games, it was hard.”
In the Panthers’ ﬁrst exhibition game against

Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Zeigler saw

time mainlyas a shooting guard off the bench. In

his 14 minutes on the ﬂoor, he recorded a total A

of ﬁve points, shooting 2-for-4 from the ﬁeld. He
tied for second on the team insteals with three.

The bulky 6—foot—5 guard said that he will
be happystarting or coming off the bench for
Pitt this season, stating that he is prepared to
do “whatever Coach [Dixon] wants.”

“We have a group of great guards, and who-
ever is on the ﬂoor can make plays,” he added.
“Coach Dixon has been stressing to the guards
that we have to defend. Whoever defends is
who will play.”

. Pitt senior forward Dante Taylor has been

_ impressed with his new teammate’s ability and

work_ ethic, and he believes Zeigler can deﬁnitely
help the Panthers. 

“He’s an older guy. Even though he’s new
here, he deﬁnitely has experience,” Taylor said.
“He’s a good player andwillingto learn, coming
into a new system and embraces us as brothers
like he’s been here since day one.” V

Taylor described Zeigler as a “slasher” and

Coach Dixon seemed to agree with that assess- ,

ment when discussing the shooting guard.
“He’s a good passer and playmaker,” Dixon

said. “He gets in the lane and gets fouled, and -

tl1at’s probably his strengths.”

With Zeigler’s willingness to play physically
and make rebounds, Taylor thinks Pitt fans will
enjoy watching their newest shooting guard
compete when he takes the ﬂoor for the Pan-

T thers this season.

“He’s an all-around good player,” Taylor said
of Zeigler. “I think you are all going.to like him
this year.” . -

‘Bubbly’ 6-foot-11 freshman from Jamaica will redshirt

Anna Weldon L
Impulse Editor

'~§j_iI\E/Iarvadene Anderson has a round face that
. she frames“ with straight hair. Her soft eyes
are open and alert, and when she laughs, ’

they sparkle with the same brilliance as her

_ smile. ’ — '

like most girls her age, she likes shoe

lshop'ping,and she has a playful personality

that resonates throughouta room._ 3 '

 _But Anderson, 19, isn’t likemostgirls

her age.

Standing at 6-foot-11, she’s the tallest
teenage girl in the world and the newest
member of Pitt’s struggling women’s bas-

ketball team. When she is ready to take the .

court, Anderson will playcenter. . .
Pitt women’s basketball head coach Ag-

lnus Berenato has high hopes for Anderson

because of her exceptional height." ‘
“She’s the only one in the world right

now. We have something special,” she said. '

Marvadene “Bubbles” Anderson has a
presence that exceeds even her height in
size, giving her a larger—than—life appearance
in all aspects. But despite the reputation
that comes with being an almost 7—foot-tall
woman, she still encounters the ‘same ob-
stacles any other college freshman would:
homesickness, tiny dorm rooms and the

tion to Performance class.

Born injamaica on May 1, 1993, Ander-
son said she was raised_ in a happy home.
She lived with her mother, Dianne Stewart,
and her 22-year-old sister Kimberly. An-
derson said people who knew her family
often noted they had remarkably similar
personality traits. ,

“We’re all similar,” she said. “People say
me, my mom and my sister all act like sisters,
‘because growing up it was always me, my
mom and my sister.”

Her nickname has been attributed to her
for as long as she can remember.

“I’ve had this nickname since I was a kid,”
she said, blaming her mother for the substi-
tution, “because of my bubbly personality.”

Garet Anderson, Anderson’s father, left
Jamaica when she was 6 years old to work
in England, where there were more job op-
portunities that would pay enough to sup-
port the family.

But Anderson insists her family found
happiness, -regardless.

“My family, we’re really simple, and we’re
happy,” she said in her distinct Jamaican
accent. ,

Growing up, Anderson knew almost im-

mediately that her height separated her from .

the crowd -— if only because of the several
inches she had over her classmates as early

as her preschool years. .

“I realized I was taller than most people
since preschool. I was always the tallest one
in my class,” she said. .

In ﬁrst grade, Anderson was already
taller than 5 feet and stood head-to-head
with her teacher.

Before coming to the United States,
Anderson attended Edwin Allen Compre-
hensive High School inJamaica, where she
played netball — a popular game in the
Caribbean (only played professionally by
women) that involves seven players on two
teams attempting to shoot a ball into raised
baskets without a backboard. V

But Anderson’s remarkable height and
outgoing personality suggested that she had

‘ a destiny of her island homeland.

At the age of 16, she moved fromjamaica
to the United States to attend Rutgers Pre-
paratory School in Somerset, N.J., where
she completed her ﬁnal years of high school
and began her basketball career under head
coach Mary Klinger, the twin sister of Pitt
women’s basketball associate head coach
Patty Coyle.

Despite limited experience playing the
game, Anderson averaged 21.2 points and
5.8 rebounds as a senior. She was named a
Courier News First Team All-Area selection
twice, and she won Most Valuable Player in

the Somerset County Tournament — her
most gratifying moment as a basketball
player.

Because of her height“ and stature, col-
leges began to notice Anderson as a seri-
ous prospect. During her senior year, she
began looking at American universities — a
huge achievement for the Jamaican native,
considering she is the ﬁrst of her family to
attend a university.

“My height got me to college. I’m the ﬁrst
one in my family who got to go to college,”
she said. .

Berenato said that she learned of Ander-

. son through Coyle.

“I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, there’s this
6-foot-10 girl transferring from Jamaica to
Rutgers Prep.’ I immediately went up to see
this kid,” the 10th-year head coach said.

But even with Anderson’s rare height,
Berenato and the coaching staff decided
that Anderson will redshirt, or sit out, this
year to get acclimated to the college game.
She will continue to practice with the team
and do the same workouts and exercises as
it does, but for her ﬁrst year, she won’t play.

“This will give her a great opportunity
to go ahead and work with her body,” Bere-
nato said.

defense, interior. presence and offensive
consistency struggled mightily all season.

Compounding the"oﬁ'ensive'woes, point l

guard Tray Woodall, the team’s primary ball
handler, missed nine games because of vari-
ous injuries. As a result, then-senior shooting
guard Ashton Gibbs was forced to play some
time at point guard and handlethe ball more
than he usually would, causing Gibbs’ scoring
to suffer —— along with the offense as awhole.

In the paint, no player was able to ﬁll
McGhee’s shoes, and Pitt fans were frustrated
by numerous poor defensive efforts from a
‘team that is usually praised for its ability to
keep opposing teams off the scoreboard.

And then there was that whole Khem
Birch thing, which left the Panthers down

another man after the talented freshman
forward transferred unexpectedly.

Overall, last'year’s Panthers just did not
have enough depth or talent to replace Wa-
namaker, McGhee and Brown. And they were
exposed when Woodall went down and Birch

left, forcing several players into action who

Panthers will need to pose more of an outside

After struggling immensely and not mak-
ing the NCAA Tournament ‘or even the NIT
last season, this year’s Pitt men’s basketball
squad has a great chance to make it to the
tournament’s Final Four for the second time
in school history.

No, you didn’t'misread that. _.

Before you dismiss me as a crazy optimist,
hear me out. '

There’s no doubt that last season was an
aberration. Even elite basketball programs
have down seasons, and last year was a per-
fect storm for Pitt to have their ﬁrst in more
than a decade.

Talented freshman Khem Birch transferred"
before conference play started, leaving the
Panthers without a game—ready center. Point
guard Tray Woodall, arguably the team’s best
player last year, missed signiﬁcant time be-
cause of nagging injuries. And Coach Jamie
Dixon tried various starting lineups —- involv~
ing star shooting guard Ashton Gibbs and
another guard running the backcourt — but
none of them came close to matching the level
of production when Woodall was healthy.

As a whole, ‘Pitt’ was a young team full of
players forced to take on bigger roles than they
were ready for. The result was a struggle—ﬁlled,
disappointing campaign.

But this season’s Pitt team is far different"

With Woodall and fellow senior Dante Tay-
lor healthy, the Panthers now have the expe-
rience and leadership. They have the depth.
And most importantly, they have the talent.
All of the components are there for this to
be the group that ﬁnally makes a run to tl£3_ ,
elusive Final Four.

After last year’s disaster, Dixon recognized
the weaknesses of his team. He needed ‘a
strong inside presence, a slasher and a backup
point guard. Those needs were addressed in
the form of freshman center Steven Adams,
point guardjames Robinson and Central Mich-
igan—transfer shooting guard Trey Zeigler.

Adams is the most hyped of the three new-
comers. The 7—foot, 250-pound New Zealander
was ranked as ESPN’s sixth best player in the
recruiting class of 2012, and he has certainly
looked the part through the offseason. Page ,
sessing elite size and strength, aboVe—average
athleticism and a quality skill set, Adams
should immediately become one of the Big
East’s best centers.

Once a top—40 recruit, Zeigler decided to .

bypass elite schools and instead play for his fa-
ther, Ernie Zeigler, at Central Michigan. Zeigler
scored more than 1,000 points in two seasons
with the Chippewas, but chose to transfer
after his father was ﬁred from the school’s

   , “mung; 0“ ‘kn town”  .   sas, aswell as Pitt, all tried to recruit Ander-

  ' I " A son to play for their_basketball programs.
But after many visits and some consider-
ation, she chose I_>itt because of the close
relationship she felt between the coaches
and players. i

“I visited a few schools, and on my offl-
cial visit here, I met the coaches, the staff,
the team, the girls,” Ande_rson explained,
saying that team cohesion was one of the
most important factors that went into her
decision. “_It’s like a family unit.”

Berenato tries to extend this familial
atmosphere by giving her ;-a_- ‘f‘little- bit of
home,” inviting Anderson toher house and
making home—cooked‘dinners_I{of the fresh-
man’s favorite food. ‘J '.  '

“I think that it’s so different for her be-
ing in America and in college. And she’s so
grateful,” Berenato said. V

Teammate and friend Chyna Golden, a
sophomore forward, agrees with Berenato
that the adjustment must be especially dif-
ﬁcult for Anderson, since she is so far from
her home.

“I’m only ﬁve or six hours away, and I still
miss home,” Golden said. “At the beginning,
she was really missing it. But being around
each other and being together, [the team is]

I like a mini—family.”

One of Anderson’s most difficult" real-
izations has been that her family has never
seen her play basketball.

“That’s a big difference from me and
every one of my teammates,” she said. “It
makes me feel sad sometimes. I look in the
stands and see my teammates’ family mem-
bers in the stands.”

But she doesn’t let that get her upset. 4

“‘I came here, and I met a lot of great
people and people who want the best for
me, and I appreciate that,” she said.

As for most new students, freshman year
has proved difficult for Anderson. She’s tak-
ing ﬁve courses, including Public Speaking
and Introduction to Performance, in which
she performed her first skit, acting as a sar-
castic doctor who waited a long time for her
patient. 7

Like other freshman students, Ander-
son is working to become more acclimated
to the University, but because of her move
from Jamaica two years ago, the transfer to
Pitt is an adjustment that she has some ex-
perience in making.

“I have to adjust a lot. But, you know, it’s
a different culture, and life is all about ad-
justment,” Anderson said.

Still, the tight dimensions of her dorm
and bathroom, where she squeezes to ﬁt in
the shower, cause her some inconvenience.

Anderson is even much taller than mast
, of her teammates. Courtesy Pitt Athletics

Anderson sleeps on an extra long bed to
make her nightly ‘slumbers less cramped.

“But I’m comfortable. I’m feeling happy
here,” she said.

Anderson’s height makes her one of the
most noticeable students on campus, and
because of her interview on “The Oprah
Winfrey Show” in 2010 -— yes, Anderson
was an interviewed guest on the popular
television show —' people often recognize
her on the street. And though some of this
unwanted attention can be annoying, An-
derson tries to make light of the situation.

“Sometimes I go out and people are like,
‘Are you the tall girl I see on TV that’s from
Jamaica?’ And I’m just like, ‘What are you
talking about?”’ Anderson joked. “I play
with them.” i »

And if she’s wearing her basketball
sweats when someone asks who she is, An-
derson chooses another sport to represent.

Instead of conﬁrming their suspicions, she v

tells curious bystanders she’s a tennis play-
er.

Even before she steps on the court to play
for Pitt, Anderson hopes her ﬁiture includes
basketball even after college. She plans on
studying broadcasting and communica-
tions, and after she graduates, she wants to
play professional basketball and help her
family emigrate to the United States.

“I would love to play basketball after col-
lege and get my family out of there from the
struggle,” she said. ‘

Until then, Anderson will continue to
work hard to make that future a possibility.

And in the meantime, despite her height,
she will wear her pair of two—inch heels, ig-
nore any negative comments and -— as her
personal motto suggests —— “keep it going.”

Last year’s struggles for depth at point
guard shouldn’t be repeated, as Robinson is
more than capable of ﬁlling in. The freshman
has already greatly impressed the coaches

‘with his high basketball IQ and trimmed-down

body. When Woodall comes out for a break,
Dixon should have no worries handing the ball
over to Robinson. ‘ .3

But it’s not just the new Panthers that make
this Pitt squad so intriguing. The veteran play-
ers are equally as impressive.

- Amongla number of talented returning
players, junior small forward Lamar Patterson
ﬁgures to be the best on the team.

Patterson showed a diverse skill set_ last.
year, shooting 41 percent beyond the arc and
averaging 9.6 points per game, in addition to
5.3 rebounds and.3.6 assists per game. With
another year of experience under his belt -—
and erﬁtter physique — Patterson’s play has
the potential to improve greatly.

Along with Woodall, Zeigler, Patterson and
Adams, Pitt"s starting lineup should be com-
pleted by redshirt junior power forward Talib
Zarma. Zanna has always excited Panthers fans
with his athletic gifts, and his strength and
scoring touch appear to ﬁnally be catching up .
with his raw talent. Plus, with the beneﬁt of
playing next to a true center in Adams, Zanna

‘ looks primed for a breakout year.

‘ With a bench featuring several guys that
would start for most teams around the coun-
try — namely Taylor,J.]. Moore and Cameron}?
Wright — Pitt has all the ingredients necessary
to enjoy an immensely successful season. It’s
just a matter of all the pieces ﬁtting together,
staying healthy and fulﬁlling their potential. »
Gibbs agreed, saying on Twitter that,’ “this
will be a Final Four year for Pitt. [They] got all
the tools.” " 1
As much as anything, this season is al)Q11ti:‘
redemption. It’s about this Pitt program prov— 
ing that it’s still one of the best in college bas- 
ketball. And they will get that redemption.
But that’s not theonly recognition the Pan-
thers could achieve. ‘ _ A
They just might get another Final Four ban- if
ner, too. ﬁ ' 5'

time at Pitt, but even with the nagging in-
sjauries, he never redshirted and has never
missed an extended chunk of action. A
contributor from the very beginning, the
former ﬁve—star high school player has
trouble believing how quickly his career
has ﬂown by.
M “It deﬁnitely went by fast,” Taylor
)"s'aid. “Just three years ago, I was a fresh-

man coming in not knowing what was
going on and just happy to be where I’m

at, and happy I had the opportunity to be_

here and make something of the oppor-
tunity.”

When he speaks of making the most of
his chance to play basketball at Pitt, he
doesn’t mean showing off for scouts or
having articles written about him.'What
he means is excelling in the classroom
and making sure he leaves the University
with a diploma.

“It’s something I deﬁnitely take a lot

of pride in. I don’t want to waste the op-

portunity, as far as being here. I’ve deﬁ-
nitely come a long way, as far as academ-
ics,” said Taylor, a social sciences major.

_“In high school, my first probably two
years, I didn’t have the best grades. But I I

just kept working hard at it, and it started
getting better and better, and each year I

_ just tried to progress. So when I got here,

I knew that was something I was gonna

need to stay on the court and to make my
mom proud by getting my degree.”

You could say Taylor, who even men-
tioned perhaps returning to Pitt at some
point to pursue a master’s degree, is a
simple man. He enjoys watching the tele-
vision series “Martin,” playing ‘‘Call of
Duty” video games and riding dirt bikes.

He doesn’t follow whether or. not the
Panthers are recruiting other centers or
forwards to compete with him. He never
even thought about basketball as a tick-
et to a better life until high school and
