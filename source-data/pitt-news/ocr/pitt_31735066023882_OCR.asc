Prof To Coach   Debaters On “Soviet Tour

By SCOT STONE _
‘ Pitt News Staff Writer

Tom Kane, professor at Pitt, has
been selected to serve as coach for
the U.S. debate team on its current
tour of the Soviet Union.

He was chosen by the Committee
on International ‘Discussion and
Debate of the Speech Communica-
tions Association (SCA).

Kane and his delegation, accor-
ding to the SCA, left for Moscow
on Friday, October 10, and are
scheduled to spend two weeks
speaking at six universities
throughout Russia.

Kane is an associate professor in
the Department ' of Speech and
Theater Arts, and, since 1967, has
been the director of the William Pitt
debating Union. I

Reaction to Kane’s selection has
been enthusiastic throughout the
university.

“Naturally I am extremely pleas-I

ed with_ his selection,” said Jack
Mathews, chairman ‘of the Depart-
ment of Speech and Theater Arts.
“His selection for a position of this
kind is a vote of confidence from
his colleagues across the country.”

“I learned of his selection about
a week ago,” Dr. Rosenberg,-dean
of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
said. ‘‘I think it’s great. Mr. Kane
is a splendid debate coach who has
not, only developed a first-rate
debate program here for our own
students, but has exerted his in-
fluence nationwide.”

These debates are part of an.

ongoing S.C.A. exchange program
with the Soviet Union that started
in 1976. According to Dr. Keele,
professor of Speech Communica-
tions at California State—Fuller-
ton, and member of the Committee

Debate, this exchangeis part of a
program thathhas been in existence»
for 58 years and has included ex-A
changes with over 50 nations.
“I took the American delegation,

two years ago, to the Soviet Union

and then last spring, when the.

Soviet delegation came to the
United States, I was their escort,”
Keele said. “Dr. Kane, taking the
delegation over this week, is the
.completion of that particular ex-
changef’ ‘.

According to Kane, debatein the
Soviet Union is not what we are ac-
customed to.

“They simply do not have a
system that would promote conflict
of ideas as a means of reaching
decisions,” Keeletsaid.‘ “They are
far more-into using what we would
call a discussion format and then
coming to a conclusion.”

Because of this, and because of
the tensions in U.S.-Soviet rela-

- tions, Keele believes it is important
to understand the premises and

values upon which the Soviets make‘

their decisions.

“I don’t think you can under-.

stand the Soviet system without
understanding their values,” Keele
- said. “The whole objective of the

— program is not to persuade anybody 2
of anything, but to make a forum-

available in which people can better.
understand the differing values of
another group.”

The topic question in this year’s
exchange concerns the respons-
ibility of the individual to the state.

“We know what their answers
will be,” Keele said. “But what the
debates make clear is how they
come to their conclusions.

“Their notion of ‘state’ is

something of an almost mystical

plain how the state evolved into an

entity whose most important func-_

tion, ultimately, was to guarantee
that any given person could max-
imize his or her identity.”

On previous trips the Soviets,
according to Keele, have been over-

whelmingly receptive.

“They were warm and very
open,” Keele said. “We debated at
six universities in the Soviet Union
in the fall of 1978, and Dr. Kane’s
delegation will make approximately
the same number of appearances.
The audiences ranged from very
knowledgab/le "and sophisticated,
around Moscow, to some of the

‘areas we went to where the, people

had never seen an American.”

.- Candidates for the American
team were discovered through a
search process that,” according to
Keele, blanketed academic pro-
gramsvand departments across the
country.
possessed. not only the ‘highly
polished skills of the debator, but

also, according to Keele, a ﬂuency ‘

in Russian, was a difficult task.
Out of a group of twelve, the Com-
mittee on International Discussion

and Debate selected three students _

to make up the delegation.

“lt’s a superb delegation,” Keele
said. “I took a very good delega-

tion and in 1976, there was‘ one_
outstanding member. But on the
. whole, in terms. of the strengths of

each individual person, they are the
best contrast we’ve been able to
come up with, representing the hard
sciences and the humanities. I just
think‘ it’s an "outstanding delega-
tion.”

Dr. Kane and his delegation are

scheduled to return from the Soviet

Council Defers Seaboard

By COLEEN MCDONALD

CAS council members, in a 7-2
vote, deferred approval of any
course for the Semester at Sea pro-
gram until the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences have acted on the program
at last.week’s meeting.

Professor Neal Galpern of the
history department, made the sug-
gestion for the deferral on" grounds
that a moral issue was at stake in
regards to the SAS program. He

2 , asked who had the right to propose

courses and what the education
value of the program was.

The S.S. Universe will be sailing
to Capetown, South Africa, said
Galpern. “

. “Is it not morally inappropriate
to send the ship to the Union of
South Africa?” asked Galpern.

The Union of South Africa was

established in 1910 under British im- ‘

perialism; In 1948, according to
Enclycopedia Brittanica, policies
were adopted by which there is now
complete domination of the state
and society by the white populata-
tion. There is enforced segregation
(of buses, trains, post, offices,
.libraries, places of business) in the
Cape Penisula. Galpern said that he
did not think students should be
sent to such a racist government.
Professor Richard Blackett of

. the black studies department was
asked to sail on the floating school ‘

but Galpern said that Blackett
"refused on account of the South

_ African destination.

“We must also consider the pro-

_ grams’ educational merits and the
.issue of academic control,” said

Galpern. ,

It is still unclear as to who has full
right to -shape the program and who
has the right to propose courses.

“At the moment, the SAS pro-
gram consists of seven-eighths
liberal ‘arts programs and one-
eighth business-course programs,”

said Galpern.

Dean Irwin Schulman, who
presided over the meeting,—said., he
had personal reservations toward
the SAS program. 7

“The new route is running‘ well, :  

Few students can afford $6500,”
said Schulman. “Also, it will be a
floating American environment
which only partially duplicates‘
study abroad.”

The formalprocess of approving
the program said Schulman, in-
volves two concerns, that of choos-_ «
ing faculty and courses. He has;
already chosen Keith MacDuffy, of I
the Hispanics department, as
academic dean for the voyage and

adivsory committee /has been ap-“
pointed to review all course’ pro--.

posals. Schulman added that there
will be 21-22 faculty on board to
cover 60 courses. '

Student representative, Thomas
Cohen, expressed concerns over
whether or not the chancellor_
should have consulted others atthe
university before informally com-

- mitting himself to the program.

Schulman said that hehimself
was consulted but as far as he

had adopted some form of informal
committment. F . '
Schulman said that the chancello

' met with the owner of the ship,

C.Y.. Tung, a Chinese shipping ‘
magnate, and was passionatedly in-'
terested in the program. _
“He (the chancellor) was obliged
to consult others before he madeup
his mind,” said Schulman, “but I‘
think he-was concerned with the '

_timing.”

The contract that the university _ .

has with the Institiute of Shipboard
Education is for a period of two
years and it requires a year’s notice
to terminate it, said Schulman.
Financial aid that will apply for

Another question was raised as to
why the University of Colorado
discontinued their affiliation ’with

the SAS program. Schulman said it '

was due to the result of'some ad-'
ministrative problems at Colorado.
“It was not because of academic
shortfall,” said Schulman. “There7
was no discrediting of the
program.” ‘ I

The new bus schedule and 

 

  SGB‘

By SCOTT STONE,
’ Pitt News Staff Writer
1 Because of our romantic analysis
of current problems, and because of
our nuclear capability, we may

stumble into a holocaust as a result -

of ’ political miscalculation. Dr.
‘Richard Cottam, Pitt profess or and
foreign policy expert, delivered this
message as part of the “American
Experience” series to an audience at

A Benedum Auditorium, Thursday,

October 15. I _
“We must, in this period that
we’re living in, analyze our pro-
blems with cold detachment,” Cot-
"tam said. “My worry is that our
» ideascrystalized in the 50’s and that
they’re frigid, and that we’ll look at

 the 80’s with theeyes of the 50’s.”

According to Cottam, we. are
romantic in our views of Soviet in-
tentions and about -our own
capabilities.

.‘‘In taking first; the intentions of
the Soviet Union, our primary
enemy, we tend to be romantic in
two very different directions,” Cot-
tam said. “There is the kind of
romanticism of the people who play
with the worst-case analysis, people
who think in horrendous scenarios,

  i met says Political Rotuﬁaniiéiztnigiteads -ro   Holocaust

\

and who look at themselves as being
realistic and hard-headed, and the,
second kind of romanticism, the
kind that people will engage in who
consider themselves peace-
makers.” .

The second model according to
Cottam - is the familiar case of
Chamberlin looking at Hitler, and
is the perception we developed after
W.W. II when the Soviet Union
showed signs of being transgressor.
But in the last l0.years, the first ’
view has been given consideration
by experts in foreign policy.

“Haven’t we, in pursuing this-
scenario (2nd), misunderstood our
enemies?” Cottam said. ‘‘In either '

.case, no matter how clever or self-

assured your practitioner (of
foreign policy) may be; we “can’t
trust the survival of civilization to
them.” “ ‘

According to Cottam, neither the
views of, the Soviets as aggressive,
or reactive, in their actions is exact-_
ly clear, and what is needed is a
more honest and objective analysis,
rather than superficial examination
and use of and_ ancient diplomatic
device, the probe. 7

The probe is a means of gaining

 

information about another nation’s
intentions." Unfortunately we only
have probe ability, according to
Cottam, in a military context. What
is needed is its use in a political one.
One such situation in which Cot-
tam believes the probe may have
been put to good usewasf in the
Iran-Iraq conflict. ' .

‘ “If we had gone to the Soviets
and made. a joint declaration of

neutrality, and an agreement, not to "

supply either side with arms,” Cot-
tam. said, “we could see if the
Soviets are interested in the stability
of South Asia. Whatever their reac-

.tion, we would be learning

something.” ' _

Cottam sees American roman-
ticism, also in how we analyse our
condition of power in the world.
Cottam makes the case‘ that‘we are
in a-natural decline. because of\the
re-emergence of the rest of\the

\world after W.W. II.‘ - '

“Why should we think that six
percent of the people of the wbrld
can exercise a level of control that
we exercised at the end of W.W.
Il?”Cottam asked. “The answer
that lbelieve we should accept, and
accept without a loss of pride or

“...we may stumble into a holocaust as a result of p'olltlcal mlscalulatlon.”

-Dr. Richard Cottam

with a loss of dignity, is simply the
fact ’ that we are ‘over-extended,
especially in South Asia.”

Dr. Cottam concluded his speech
by proposing a strategy of military
disengagement, and increased
economic relations with the entire
global community, especially the

“ Whether the Soviet Union is ag-

gressive or reactive, wehave to ac-
cept the reality of our power, and
the reality'of our power requires
that we begin in this era to set up a
process of disengagement,” Cottam
said. “If we do these things and we
find that the U.S.S.R. is not ag-
gressive, then the possibility of a
generation of real peace is one that
could be apparent to us.”

 Medial Board

Feedback on

' Nick Arnett’s article, ‘_fUse Per-
suasion, Not Force,” left out an im-
portant piece of information con-
cerning the administration’s deci-
sion to Sepervise the editorial
policies of The Pitt News. Namely,
what exactly was’ the administra-
tion’s reason for wanting to super-
vise The Pitt News? Is it because

¢ they wish to remedy the “lack of

journalistic quality” that The Pitt
News has been criticized for? Or is
the administration gwielding the
heavy hand of censorship? The ad-
ministration’s “use of force”
makes sense under the cir-

cumstances of censorship. In sucﬁa -

case, I would have been interested
to know the standards and rules
they set in judging.

However, Arnett’s article focuses

upon the needs to improve the jour-
nalistic quality of ‘The Pitt News.
That can’t be why the Media- Board

' is watching over student publica-

tions, is it? Is the quality of writing
so bad that there is -yet another
"‘editor” up there who has the final
word on what’s printable or not?

Arnett’s intentions are not clear
at all. If t)1e’Pitt News wants to in-
form students of the administra-

tion’s use or coercion in governing --

student publications they should be
forthright and tell us why and how
the Media Board is enforcing cen-

. sorship.

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Sports Editor
Although the West Virginia
Mountaineers had» a quarterback
named Luck and a running back
they called Alexander the Great, the
Mounties ‘didn’t have enough to

handle the Panther football team as

“Pitt defeated «WVU, 42-14,

on

A Saturday.

Running back Robert Alexander
gained only 37 net yards, his longest
run from scrimmage being an
ll-y_arder. Mountaineer. quarter-
back Oliver Luck was 10 of 28 for

' only 93 yards, but he threw for both

touchdowns \and was a tough man
to tackle. '

“He’s awfully tough to get
down,” said Pitt coach Jackie Sher-
rill. “He’s a great competitor, but I
think in the second half we started

-to’ get to them and wear them

down.” -

The Panthers did indeed wear
WVU down in the second half. In
fact, the Mountaineers were pretty
‘much out. of the game at halftime
when Pitt led 35-7. ‘

“lthought our- players bounced
back and played very well,” said
Sherrill. “The first half, our players
played and executed very well. In
the third quarter, we weren’t as in-
tense as we had been in the first

half.” ~

The Mountaineers played tough
in the early going and actually led

"up__until just a little over a minute
.was left in the first quarter. Both
‘teams had trouble moving the ball

in the early going and each punted
on its first possession. ~

_ On WVU’s second possession,‘
the Mounties punted to Willie Col-

’ _ lier who took the ball at the Pitt 12

and fumbled. West Virginia’s An-’

dre Gist jumped on the ball and the

i ‘ Mountaineers gtook little time to

:’ 3. 7-0 and

~ score. On the second play of the

drive, Luck saw Cedric Thomas in
the end. zone and hit him for a

"seven-yard touchdown. The extra
’ . pointwas good and WVU was up

 

 

 

 

  

 

the Pitt fans were in shock.

rightback to even up the score on
their next series. Joe McCall ran
first for eight yards‘ and then for 10

With a first 'and"ten- from the Pitt
37, Dan Marino hit Collier, who

~ was run out of bounds after picking

Two plays later, Marino threw
long to Benjie Pryor who made a

Rick Trocano came into the game
to lead the Panthers to their next
score in one of the most impressive
drives of the game. Starting deep in

- its own territory, Pitt moved 75
yards in 13 plays for a touchdown.

McMillan. bulled over the center
for the one-yard score. On the extra

point try, Ricky Jackson called the . .
audible ‘and ran the ball in for a"

two-point conversion and Pitt was
up 15-7. The Panthers never looked

On the first play Pitt’s next of-
fensive series, T rocano passed com-
plete to Dwight Collins who cut left
and ran for a 53-yard touchdown.
Trout missed the ,extra point and
Pitt led 21-7.

Things went from bad-to worse
for the Mountaineers as, on the first
play of WVU’s next possession,
Luck was ch_ased in the backfield
and fumbled. Pitt’s ' Bill Neill
jumped on the ball and Pitt took
over at the West Virginia 20. Again
lighting struck when on the second
play, after a five-yard procedure
penalty, Trocano threwto Collier
who ran down the right side for a
25-yard touchdown. Trout kicked
the extra point and Pitt was now up
28-7. 

West Virginia» fumbled away
another seven points on the next
series of plays as Luck-lost the ball
when he went back to pass. Jackson
recovered, this time at the WVU 24.

Four plays later,. McMillan
scored his second touchdown of the
game with just a minute left in the
first half. The half ended with Pitt
leading the Mountaineers 35-7.

The Panthers couldn’t get things
together in the third quarter as their

deepest penetration of that period»

was to the Pitt_45. Very late in the
third quarter, with asecond-and-12
at the 20-yard line, Trocano passed
to Pryor, but the pass was tipped
and intercepted by WVU’s Allen
Moreland. He returned the ball 16
yards-to the Pitt 20. Two plays

extra point closed out the scoring
for the Mountaineers.

Pitt’s“fourth quarter score was a
bit of razzle-dazzle by the Panther
offense. With a first-and 10 at the
50, on a reverse,.Collins passed long
to Collier who made a perfect catch
ir‘1.the end zone for the final Pitt
score. With the extra, point, Pitt
ended the day.’s scoring, 42-14.

\“Pitt’s TD in the second half was
one of the greatest offensive foot-
ball plays I’ve ever seen,” said
WVU coach Don Nehlan. “We had

it defensed perfectly, but Collins_

threw it 50 yards right on the but-
ton.” - - A
Jackson led the Pitt defense with

sacks. ‘ M
“Defensively, I feel that we were
more fired up--we had something to
prove,” said Jackson. “Today, we

didn’t have any busts defensively.” ' 7

One of the big’ questions is who

‘ will start at the‘ quarterback posi-

— tion Saturday against Tennessee. “I
‘felt Ricky came in and executed

very well,” said Sherrill. “We’ll ,

have to put him back at quarter-
back ‘until we know more about
Danny.” ’ ‘

Trocano was 11 of 18 for 150
yards and two touchdowns. He was
intercepted twice during the con-
test. In the time he was in, Marino
was four of 10 for\45 yards.

“It wasn’t any easier comingin
[for the second time but, basically,
l’ve seen WVU for ‘three years and
they played the same type of
defense that we play,” said
Trocano. “My offensive line gave
me great time to throw and split

routes. The coaches feel that I have

Oregon Ties USC

One by one, Alabama’s
challengers for national honors
keep dropping by the wayside. But
the Crimson Tide can’t do anything
about its biggest threat to
Southeastern Conference
supremacy.

Alabama, behind its sturdy
defense, i-stifled Tennessee, 27-0,
while sixth-ranked Georgia, led by
freshman sensation Herschel
Walker’s record 283,-yard rushing
show, swamped Vanderbilt 41-0.

Georgia and Alabama have 3-0
SEC records and so does unranked
Louisiana State, a 17-10 winner
over Kentucky. But Alabama and
Georgia do not play each other this
year. If they wind up with 6-0 con-

ference marks, Georgia will go to’

the Sugar Bowl.
.The .218-pound freshman shat-

, tered' Charlie Trippi’s 35-year-old

Georgia rushing record by carrying
23 times for.those’283 yards, in-
cluding touchdown" runs of 60—the
first time he touched the ball—48
and 53.

It would be interesting to see
Walker against Alabama since the
Crimson Tide held explosive Ten-
nessee to 59 yards in total offense in
what Coach Bear Bryant called

“one of the best defensive games
we’ve ever played.” .
While Alabama kept the Vols

withouta first down and to minus 2 ,

yards in first-half offense” en route
to its 27th consecutive victory,
Peter Kim kicked four field goals
and Ke_n Coley and Major Ogilvie
ran for touchdowns.
Second-"ranked Southern Califor-

nia, held to a 7-7 tie by Oregon, was .

the latest victim in this season’s rash
of college football upsets.

Southern Cal stretched its-

unbeaten streak to- 26 games, but
that includes two ties. This one was
somewhat controversial since the
Trojans scored on a disputed

38-yard touchdown pass from Gor-
don'Adams to Jeff Simmons in the-

second period.

Most of the pro-Oregon crowd in
Eugene thought Simmons was out‘

of bounds when he made a diving

catch deep in the end zone but the
Oregon ‘

officials ruled otherwise.
tied it on Terrance Jones’ 3-yard
run in the third quarter. And it was
Oregon, not USC, which felt it
should have won. V

“This tie is against a quality foot-
ball team,” said Coach Rich
Brooks.

Pitt’s victory against West Virginia on Saturday

I showed two things. First, the Panthers are capable

of coming back after a disappointing loss, and se-
cond, coach Jackie Sherrill may be starting the wrong
‘quarterback. ~ I

Marina and Rick Trocano, statistical_ly Marino seems

7 to be superior. After all, entering the West Virginia

game, Marino had moved into third place.on Pitt’s
all-time passing list with 2,859 yards, thus moving
Trocano down to fourth place with 2,818 yards. For '

’ a sophomore signal-caller to be ranked so high in the

team passing stats truly is remarkable. But there is‘
more to being quarterback than just throwing the

" ball.

The quarterback has to be the ‘field general, the
man who leads the offensive unit. The quarterback
has to be in complete control at all times. ‘When he-
falters,» the whole‘_offense suffers. That seemed to be
one of the problems against Florida State. When the ,
Seminoles took the early lead, that put the pressure
on Marina and the offense to score quickly and
often. "Faced with that challenge on enemy turf,
Marino seemed to be unsettled and unsure of what he

was doing. That perhaps caused the turnovers late in
the game that ruined any comeback hopes.

You could argue for hours .what actually was the

cause for the offensive breakdown at Florida State ,

but the most logical is that a. sophomore quarterback
just is not ready to take over the leadership role. That
was the first game where Marino ran up against both
trying to make-up a big’ deficit as well as having to
contend "against a‘ big and noisy crowd.» Plain and
simply, he is not ready to be Pitt’s team leader.

Recent past shows that Matt Cavanaugh wasn’t the
number one‘ quarterback until he was _a junior. He,
despite all his greatness, had to sit on the bench in
favor of a senior. When Rick Trocano became Pitt’s
number one QB in 1978 as a sophomore‘, Pitt was on-
ly 8-4 that season, a big disappointment: from what
was expected. Trocano just wasn’t ready to be the
leader of the team.

‘of accomplishing this task will be if Rick Trocano is‘
I the starting quarterback. ’ A »

substitute. For the quarterback position, it really
takes two and sometimes three years to be ready to
take over the controls ofthe offense. Marino, for all
his talent, does not seem to have the poise that is
needed.. He needs more experience. 4
When Marino left the game against the Moun—-
taineers in the first quarter with an injured knee,
Trocano followed to provide the Panthers some very

much needed leadership. The senior quarterback—- _'

turned safety-——showed no ill effects from not playing
his original position that much. He stepped right in
and moved the team in the air and more importantly
on the ground. In short, Trocano was i.n‘total con-_ '

more of them. The Panthers will have to face the test
of playing before approximately 97,000 people who»
are coach Johnny Majors worshipers. The Pan-
thers, especially the offense, will have to keep their
composure and be able to maintain a balanced at-
tack. Even if Marina is 100 percent, the best chance

aits for Chance it

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Pitt News Sports Writer

Julius_ Dawkins exudes con-
fidence. He doesn’t walk, he de-
fiantly struts, swaying his shoulders

' back and forth stating his belief in
himself; Dawkins is his own public ’

relations man. T

“I want to be the best receiver in
the NCAA. I think I can do that
when I get the chance.”

_Dawkins, ’ a sophmore from
Monessen, hasan ebullient disposi-
‘tion about.his.role on the Panthers.
One of the most sought after high
receivers in the country last year,
Dawkins did not play_ much as.a

freshman, but as he puts it, there‘

were circumstances beyond his con-
trol. »

“I injured my thumb last year
and although it healed I felt uncom-
fortable.__ catching the ball,” said
Dawkins. “A lot of times I couldn’t
hold on to the ball and I didn’t
know the offense too well. That
didn’t help either.”

In his second _year, Dawkins has
seen. considerably more playing
time. The thumb does not bother
him any more and the offense is-no
longer a mystery. All that is missing
is for that immense potential to
start reeping benefits. It has just

begun. . .

Dawkins, a speedburner with 4.5
speed ‘ in the 40-yard dash has
already caught 8 «passes for 144
yards. That’s an average of 18 yards
a catch. This -average further adds

7 to the belief that Julius Dawkins is a

big play receiver. ,

128 Ociklcind Ave.
687-2752

    

‘‘I definitely feel that I’m a big
play receiver but I just haven’t had
the chance to show that I c'an play.
One of my strong points is that I
can run very well‘ in the open field
but when I get the chance people
will know what they’ve missed out

Dawkins has reason to boast. As
a high school player, recruters

drooled over the prospect of having ‘fa.

Dawkins, 6-foot—2, 185 pound blue
chipper, settlingunder a pass for
their school. To Dawkins there was
never any doubt. . .

“I’ve always wanted to play for
Pitt because I’ve watched them on
TV all the time and felt that they
displayed a closeness among the
players that I wanted to be part
of.” ' a

With Willie Collier and Dwight
Collins and Dawkins, the Panthers
have a set of receivers thatat any
time _can break a long one. In Col-
lins and Dawkins Pitt has two
game-breakers ~ for the future.

Dawkins, who right now is backing
‘ up Collier, is_ just itching for his

turn. Dawkins realizes the reason
for his limitedvplaying time.
“Willie stayed here this summer

and worked with Dan Marino:

Their timing is real good, while
mine wasn’t as sharp,” said
Dawkins. “Willie and I weren’t
talking much during. camp because

we were battling for a job, -but now

we just get along great.”

Confidence is not lacking in
Julius Dawkin’s repertoire. ‘Only
Julius Dawkins knows that he will
be better than everyone expected. »

“I like to call run audibles. We
have a fine set of running backs and
I like to take advantage of that,” he
said. “When-I’m in there, I like to

The injury to Marino might not

Trocano has voiced the fact that he
