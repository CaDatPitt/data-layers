Maybe It’s Not Yet Spring,
But This Is A Spring Dance

Violet Hager

PRING IS IN THE AIR, say the engineers, and the above two, although
dodging any grand march, as engineers insist on doing, still lead tonight's

Spring Dance of the Engineering Association at Hotel Schenley.

It starts at

9, ends at 1, features Jimmy Bray’s 10-piece orchestra, costs a dollar, and is
very strictly informal. Britton is chairman, the young lady is his queen,

Heralding‘ _the early arrival of
spring, the Engineers dance in the
Schenley Ballroom tonight at their
annual Spring Dance.

William Britton, ChE36, chairman
of the affair, and Violet Hager of
Brownsville will mythically lead the
affair, for the Engineering Association
Dance is noted for lacking a grand
march.

Jimmy Bray’s teii-piece orchestra
will provide the music for dancing.
which is scheduled from 9 to 1 o’clock.

The chaperons for the EA dance are

Mrs. J. Elwood Amos. Guests of the
EA will be Mr. and Mrs. H. C.

Freshman’s Eyes
Hurt In Lalo Blast

William Davies’ Condition Serious
After Failing To Dilute Acid

Sometime today members of the

staff of the Ear and Eye Hospital on
Lathi'ope'_ Street will know the extent
OI the injuries to the eyes of lVilliam
Davies, Jr., C40, seriously hurt in an
inorganic chemistry laboratory ex-
plosion Wednesday morning.

Davies, experimenting with sul-
Dhuric acid. hydrogen peroxide, and
potassium permanganate, was splat-
tered with acid in both eyes by a sud-
den explosion in his apparatus. Im-
mediate attention by Laboratory Iii-
structor Tobias H. Dunkelberger,
graduate assistant, with ﬁrst aid
measures, and a rush trip to the hos-
pital were probably responsible for
any chance of full recovery he might
stand, according to authorities.

Cause of the explosion, it has been
determined, was Davies’ use of a con-
ceiitrated solution of sulphuric acid iii-
stead of a diluted solution, as had
been ordered.

Also splattered, but slightly, by
acid was John Firch, C40, who im-
mediately wiped the dangerous liquid
from his person. He suffered no harm-
ful results. Flying glass ricocheted
off, causing no damage.

There were 60 students in the class
at the time, ﬁrst to fourth hour inclu-
sive, under Dunkelberger, and Edward
F. Furtsch, graduate assistant.

Davies, a pre-medical student, just
turned 17, is a graduate of Carrick
High School, where he worked on the
school paper and stood ninth in a
class of 76.

-Druids Promise Everything

But Free Roadsters At Drag

 

“It may not be the most expensive
dance ever held, and it may not have
the best orchestra, but We are certain
that the Druid Drag is the most al-
lrterative dance ever to entertain the
Lllllversity students.”

In these and other words, Frank
Ellgel. E38. president of Druids, gave
advance notice that the two or three
students who stay away from the
Druid Drag Monday afternoon are go-
1113 to miss "a heck of a good time.”

Whether Mayor William McNair
will attend or not is still an unsettled
l”.'roblem. A delegation of 15 tried
men and true. fortiﬁed by the audition
of Paul Koliberger, C38, and Stephen
Goodale. C38, also Phi Ganis, visited
the mayor’s oflice Tuesday, but that
elusive individual had just had an en-
counter with his dentist, and did not
feel quite up to the task of talking to
a delegation of Druids.

But mayor or no mayor, there will
still be bevies and bevies of Univer-
sity women, all invited guests, and in
addition. the Cweiis from Carnegie
Tech will be there en inasse. Engel
revealed that there are still a few
-dances to be secured with the Kilties.
and that reservations may be made by
calling Druid headquarters any time
before 5:30 o'clock today. According

to Engel. who seems to know, these
Tartan lassies can even dance the
Highland Fling,

Latest reports from official sources
indicate that classes will not be dis-
continued after 2:30 o’clock Monday
afternoon, but, as Eiigel slyly remark.
ed, “Use your own judgment.”

Engel said to emphasize that all
University women are invited guests,
but also to emphasize the fact that
YOU can bring a date if you want to.
It's still included in the price of your
35-091“ ticliet (If You hunt around
long enough, you may ﬁnd a Druid
who has one left.)

The most. important feature of the
dance will be the tapping of two ﬁrst
seniester sophomores into the organi-
zation. If you’re ,a ﬁrst semester
sophomore man, it might be a good
idea. to show up Monday afternoon,
and if you're a woman who knows a
first-semester sophomore man, it
might also be a good idea to be there.

Earl Melleii and his melody trust,
a band of absolutely no more than
11 pieces, will play for the dance, and
Druids suggest that. if you’ve never
seen one before, now is the time to
come and see a dance with not only
no “stag" line, but perhaps a “doe"
one.

Fisher Expoiinds 
View On Money

Form Of Gold Standard Desirable,
Instructor Tells Dinner Forum

By Daniel Lichtenstein

Speaking at a dinner forum last
Tuesday, Allan J. Fisher, instructor in
accounting, expounded his theory on
the “Orthodox or Conventional Point
Of View Of MOIIGY.” The forum was
held in the Penn-McKeesport Hotel in
McKeesport.

Mr. Fisher made particular refer-
ence to the functioning of the gold
standard in pre-war days in compari-
son to the post-war periods. He said,
“It is desirable to maintain a form
of the gold standard as a safeguard
against inﬂation.” He has been inves-
tigating the experience of the British
Empire with the gold standard in the
post war period.

Fisher tried to impress on his audi-
eiice that, “The go'd standard is a
managed currency, although it is usu-
ally regarded as an automatic mech-
a.nisni.” Under the gold standard
there are certain checks on the man-
agement of currency, whereas under
a paper currency almost complete dis-
cretion is vested in the monetary au.
thorities.”

He further stated that, “A danger
of credit inﬂation arises in the United
States with gold holdings of slightly
over 10 billion dollars and excess
member bank reserves of about 3 bil-
lion dollars.” .

The other sides of the money ques-
tion were taken up by James Fulton,
author of books on money and interna-
tional trade, who spoke on “A Man-
aged Currency,” and Father O’Toole,
head of the Department of Philosophy
at Duquesne University. who discuss-
ed “Money from the Viewpoint of
Father Cough1in.”

Fulton contended that government
managed currency is not based on
gold, while Father O'Toole discussed
the age old question of the signiﬁcance
of interest and the justiﬁcation of its
payment. »

Seven Fraternities Are Assessed
To Cover Deﬁcit Incurred
By Greek Formal Ball

Pending approval of Undergraduate
Cap and Gown, lntei-fraternity Couii-
cil will hold its second informal dance
of the year on the Friday evening of
Cap and Gown week, April 20.

The sponsoring of this aifair jointly
with the undergraduate. club, if it so
desires, was approved at the last
Council meeting Tuesday, at the
Lambda Chi Alpha house. Ben Bas-
kin, C37, and VV. Gordon Rauck, C37,
were appointed to complete their in-
vestigations as to dance probabilities.

As reported by Philip Andrews,
M36, business manager of the Inter-
fra.ternity Ball, seven fraternities who
did not have their quota of members
present at the dance were assessed to
cover the consequent deﬁcit. Edward
Durkin, C36, Kappa Sigma, when con-
fronted witli a bill for $33, was heard
to remark: “It I had known that
Kappa Sigma was going to be host at
the dance, I'd have seen that some of
our boys got there!” .

Cups for the bowling championship
were presented by _William Housel,
C37, Delta Tau Delta, athletic chair-
man, to Phi Delta Thetitand Lambda
Chi Alpha, the f1"z1fél'llltlGi3il which took
first and second places, respectiv-ely.
Housél aiiiiounced that immediately
following the coiiipletioii of the bas-
ketball toui‘naiIiéiit, i-nterfraternity
ping pong, indoor track, and bridge
would be scheduled, all to take place
within the coming month.

N. Robert Seidle, assistant to the
dean of men and fraternity adviser,
opened a discussion of the initiation
tactics employed by certain of the
fraternities. Charging that fraternity
men going through “hell week” were
endangering their health, annoying
the faculty, and making themselves
seem ridiculous in the eyes of the
campus, Mr. Seidle cautioned the
Council to stop these actions before
“stringent penalties” are imposed.

Immediately before a. fuseblew out,
and du_ri_i_ig the ensuing darkness,
Council debated the advisability of
awarding keys to junior. as well as to
senior represeiitatives._ It was decid-
ed that every member who has served
 full term will be awarded an I—F
Council key.

In the three weeks following the
next meeting of Council,-April 7, at
the Phi Delta Theta house, elections
of oﬁicers for 1936-37 will be held.

Students Take Some Potshots
At F acism In Inquiry -Forum

 

By James Donoghue

In a panel discussion meeting Wed-
uesday that resolved itself into more
of an organized collective debate, ﬁve
students and three faculty members
discussed fascism, potential and pres-
ent, in the United States.

The panel was sponsored by Inquiry
Forum. The discussion was led by Dr.
James C_ Charlesworth, associate pro-
fessor of political science. Those par-
ticipating in the panel were: William
Young and Edwin Banks, graduate as-
assistants in poltical science; William
Stark, C38; James Eiclielberger, C38;
Katherine Monori, C36; Patrick Dil-
lon, C37; and Albert Brandon, C36,

The discussion followed four main
points: the nature of fascism; the con-
ditions implicit iii the States at the
present time which seem to point to-
ward fascism; figures and institutions
in American public life which seem to
stand for fascist principles; and meth-
ods of combating the growth of fasc-
ism.

There was a certain amount of dis-
agreement about the nature of fasc-
ism. Banks held the opinion that
four main features are peculiar to it:
dictatorship, restriction freedom, na-
tionalism and racial antipathies, capi-
talistic control. Dr. Charlesworth 111

company with a number of others
pointed out that these characteristics
are not peculiar to fascism. Its
concept of the state as authoritarian
and totalitarian is found, he said. Dr.
Verne C. Wright, assistant professor
of sociology, pointed out that fascism
is “an enforced capitalism.”

On the broad general points the au-
dience was more or less in agree-
ment with the idea advanced by the
chairman, Dr. Charlesworth, at the be-
ginning, “The point is not whether
fascism is good or bad; fascism is bad
and the question is just what fascism
is and what can be done about it.”

Change in the forces of traditional
motivation, an acute crisis in the
status of the middle class. concentra-
tion of industry, lack of unity among
the forces opposed to fascism were
advanced to assist the growth of
fascism in this country. From the
ﬂoor a student asked whether it is not
inherent in the nature of capitalist
economy that fascism is inevitable.

When it came to “nominating” al-
leged proponents of fascism in the
United States for a “Hall of would-be

founding fathers of fascism,” men’s
names came thick and fast. Wil-
liain Randolph Hearst headed‘ the

It Can’t Hapipen Here
The liluhlenberg Weekly tells of a case of real devo-

Any Local Interest?

After negotiating for ﬁve years, the officials of the

“many instances, church property has

deﬁnitely on its way as one of the
ﬁne a.rts,” opined Philip C. Elliott, as-
sistant professor of ﬁne arts, in an il-

lustrated lecture, “Photography and
Art,” delivered Vvednesday evening in
Sta.te Hall.

Photography, he said, can never
imitate painting. The camera records
objects impersonally and without dis-
tortion. At the time photography
came into existence, he continued,
painting was sentimental and literal.

But at the end of the 19th century,
Mr. Elliott continued, painters broke
away from literal meanings and be-
gun to seek pictorial values, starting
a movement which has its extreme
manifestation in the frank abstrac-
tions of Pablo Picasso, the French
modernist. It was then, he added,
that photography had to strike out
for itself.

Speaking to amateur photographers,
Mr. Elliott emphasized the importance
of good composition in photography.
“The photographer,” he said, “should
think in terms of masses rather than
objects, and not try to get too much
into the picture. Subject matter
should be chosen so as not to be com-
plicated.”

Vi«'ith regard to choice of subject
matter, Mr. Elliott said that the pho-
tng1'a1)‘ie:- must develop an intuitive
sense of design while looking for sub-
jects. C-bjects should be photograph-
ed for their pictorial value and should
be separated from their sentimental
rmin::~t.a{“i.'m as much as possible.
’ has lie‘ continued, the corrugated
surface of a garbage can is just as
pictorial as a ﬂuted column of the
Parthenon.

For subject matter, Mr. Elliott con-
tended, Pitlsburgli offers one of the
most fruitful spots for photographers
and has been all too little photo-
graphed.

“Myrtle, the sophomore turtle,” is
still on the campus.

Myrtle was presented at a luncheon
in Heinz House early last semester to
Miss Jlane Schermer, instructor in
physical education. Myrtle was meant
to symbolize the “slowness” of the
class, about which Miss Schirmer had
often grown irate.

After her coming-out party, which
earned brief mention in the Pitt News,
Myrtle was forgotten.

But she is still alive and happy.
She lives in a glass bowl in the wo-
men’s gym office up on the hill. Al-
though she cuts no ﬁgure in the world-
at—large, Myrtle is petted and pamper-
ed and given the best of care by Miss
Schermer and the girls majoring in
physical education.

Only one thing troubles her keep-
ers: she has never been known to eat
anything, however, she always seems
to be in the best of health!

Many stories, unsubstantiated, are
told about Myrtle. It is said that she
goes for a walk every afternoon,
usually down to the Medical school,
and sometimes does not return for
days. Her admirers also claim she
can stand on her head, shake hands,
and roll over 011 her back and play
dead.

She has been known to climb up on
a shelf above her bowl and dive into
the water. Recently, she disappeared
for two weeks. She was found sleep-
ing behind a door.

‘When l‘vIyrtle was brought out to
do her stuff before The Pitt News
reporter, she cocked her head and
winked one eye, as if to say, “So you
want me to show off do you? Well,
I won’t!”

Contrary, she withdrew into her
shell, and refused to come out, ignor-
ing the earnest pleadings of her in-
terviewer.

Commerce, the American Legion, the
Reserve Officers Training Corps, the
Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion, (who as Roger Baldwin said
here recently, “Don’t want to be the
mothers of another”).

Various methods to prevent the
growth of fascism were proposed.
One speaker advocated greater con-
centration of power in the hands of
the Federal government, in order
that Congress might move toward so-
cial security, farm beneﬁts, etc. An-
other suggestion on this line was the
proposal for the government to en-
gage more actively in business,
through greater loans by the Recon-
struction Finance Corporation. It
could then foreclose on business en-
terprises if they fail to meet the in-
terest or principal payments on the
loan.

But the proposal which seemed to
receive the support of most of the au-
dience and those on the panel was
the suggestion for increased unioni-
zation in industry. Other sugges-
tions were recourse to political ac-
tion, and a strengthening of the
“United Front” against organizations
of capital engaged in political action,
such as the American Liberty League.

Dr_ Charlesworth in summing up
the discussion expressed the opinion
that he “does not look for fascism to
come in the United States.” He
emphasized the fact that there has
been a. long tradition of self-govern-
ment in England and the US, where.
as in Germany and Italy there were
only short periods. “blinks of the eye,”
of self-government.

“Fascism does not follow a pat-
tern,” he said. “Types of government
are like the shapes of noses or of
heads. They are implicit in the na-
ture of the society in which they are
found. Wlien America has a reforma-
tion, it will be distinctly American.”

Mexico Has Zllost Adoanced
Labor Code, Says Hanson

 

By William Stark
“Mexico has the most advanced labor code in the history of capitalistic
The Mexicans have minimum wages; an eight-hour day; a seven-
hour night; no child labor; and labor dominates the national government.”
Thus A. \Vayne Hanson, international ﬁeld secretary of the YMCA, charac-
terized “Mexico Today,” in a lecture before Dr. Benjamin Williams’ interna-

societies.

tional relations class on Wednesday.

Mr. Hanson pointed out that Mexico¢
has a population of 16 million, speak-
ing 51 dialects. The population is
spread over 7-0 000 villages and sev-
eral cities. There are nine million
halfbreeds, six million “pure” na-
tives, and one million whites living in
Mexico.

“To a remarkable extent,” be add-
ed, “Mexico is still the prisoner of
tradition. One need not dig down
very deep into their present society
to ﬁnd strains of Aztec culture.

“Mexico has had in the past cen-
tury an average of two revolutions
a year,” he continued, “an average of
a new president every eight months,
and a new constitution every ten
years. The Mexicans have had over
4,000 revolutions in their history.
But now, their society is a cooperative
economic system tending towards
socialism. Formerly, the land prob-
lem was of primary importance; but
under the new system, a distribution
of land, a program of public works,
a speeding-up of education, and a bet-
ter foreign relations policy have
tended to improve the country.”

“Previous to the revolution of 191-0,”
he continued, “85 per cent of the ru-
ral land was owned by one per cent
of the people. Four thousand people
owned Mexico, supported by whip-
ping posts, the army, and forced "em-
ployment in any section of the coun-
try. Illiteracy was 80 to 85 per cent
and death rate was three times that
of American cities.”

“Since the institution of the new
government,” he added, “education
has gone forward on a large scale.
Many school buildings were construct-
ed on a cooperative basis, with many
of the furnishings bought with money
taken up in collections. Army mem-
bers volunteered for teaching service,
and education was spread over the
entire country. The schools have be-
come virtual social centers. About
13,000 such centers have sprung up
in the past two decades.”

“The socialism of Mexico,” he
emphasized, “is deﬁnitely not a Rus-
sian importation. The Mexicans be-
gan on their socialistic experiment in
1917, even before the Russian revolu-
tion had taken place. Furthermore.
they do not seem to be afraid of so-
cialism, as we Americans are. In in-
stituting socialism in their education-
al system, they have tended to drive
out religion, so that there are only
200 registered priests.”

Mr. Hanson pointed out that in
been conﬁscated, and priests have
been expelled.

In speaking of the power of lab.or,
he pointed out that the YMCA in
Mexico is the only place in the world
where the buildings are organized.
Several years ago, the Y building was
closed for 68 -days until the 90 em-
ployes joined a union.

Mr. Hanson concluded by pointing
out that American ambassadors,
Dwight Morrow, and the present rep-
resentative, Josephus Daniels, in par-
ticular, have built up a strong bond of
friendship between the two countries,
but that the Mexicans will tolerate
absolutely no interference in their at‘-
fairs on the part of the United States.

Engineers Relax,
Puzzle At’ Smoker

Dr. I-Iolbrook Is Principal Speaker
At Semi-Annual Group Affair

By Sam Williams

Not content with long daytime lab-
oratories in production planning al-
ternating and direct current, strength
of materials, intricate assignments
in calculus, and hours over drawing
boards and T-squares, membelrs of
Sigma Tau, honorary engineering fra-
ternity, took it out on themselves
and guests the other evening.

At the semi-annual smoker of the
organization recently, mathematics,
precision problems, and general ex-
aminations were passed out to and
puzzled over by 30 actives and 36
;;-rospective pledges.

“‘Ba.ttleship,” cube root of 35, 18
to the seventh power, in all 16 bafflers
were mulled over for a half hour.
Slide rules and ﬂying wedges were
barred.

First prize of a half carton of
cigarettes went to non-smoker Alex-
ander Hendrick. ChE37, for complet-
ing 14 of the 16 problems in record
time.

“Pathways of Progress” and “Dy-
namic America,” moving pictures of
electrical development in manufactur-
ing methods and transportation
methods, followed on the program.
_ O. D. Montgomery, EE36, president
of Sigina Tau, before introducing E‘.
A. Holbrook, dean of the Schools of
Engineering and Mines, and mem-
ber of the fraternity, gave a brief his-
tory of the national fraternity and
the local Psi chapter.

Dean I-Iolbrook outlined the three
qualiﬁcations for membership in the
orggaiiization. These are scholarship,
practicability, and sociability. The
sc‘.-*.-olarship requirements are a quality
point average of 1.9 for ﬁrst semester
juniors, 1.7 for second semester jun-
iors. and 1.5 for seniors. Practicability
pertains to the ability to apply en-
gineering knowledge to the solution of
practical problems.

The policy of Sigma ‘Tan is to rec-
ognize the student engineer and to
endorse movements which advance
the best metliods of engineering edu-
cation. Pledges for this fraternity
will be announced on Scholars’ Day,

Cats, Lions Battle Tomorrow
Night In League Encounter

 

Carlsonmen Score Revenge Triumph Over Georgetown
To Pad Lead In Eastern Conference Chase

Still shooting high for that ﬁrst conference victory, Penn State's
basketball team comes to Pittsburgh tomorrow evening for its second

crack at the Panther cagers Cm the Stadium floor.

It "s a game that

doesn’t make the slightest difference as to the Lion standing, al-
though it may make them feel mentally better by licking the Pan-
thers, but it is an important affair for the Carlsonmen.

Thus far this season, the State-

dribblers have been woefully weak in
conference games. Out of eight shots
at league rivals, they have missed
every time. Tomorrow night the
Lions hope to break into the winning
side of the standing sheet, and at the
same time give Pitt's title stock a
downward trend.

It was almost two months ago that
the Lions and the Panthers chewed
at each other on the basketball court.
At the time. the Panther took the big-
gest and greatest amount of bites.
with the result that the ﬁnal count-
up gave the Lions 43 scars and the
Panthers 23 teethmarks. Since then
the State boys have taken ﬁve
straight defeats at the hands of mem-
bers of the conference.

One thing unusual about the last
Pitt-Penn State clash was the Pan-
ther’s manner of taking their 43
bites out of the Lions. Every man on
the team, ten of them, all scored at
least one basket. Joe Garcia seemed
to be the most bloodthirsty, with his
eight counters. Four Panthers scored
four times, four scored four markers,
and one trailed with two points.

Only Mountaineers Remain

Tomorrow night’s affair closes the
home season for the Panther Cage
team. After that, only one game re-
mains on the Pitt schedule, that being
the VVest Virginia conference game
carded at Morgantown next We(lnes—
day. If the Panthers sweep through
these last two lea.gue battles with tri-
umphs, they are assured of their
fourth consecutive Eastern Intercol-
legiate Conference title.

As the preliminary to the varsity
game tomorrow, the Little Panthers
will play Braddock High’s strong
quintet. The preliminary starts at 7
o'clock, with the main attraction com-
ing on right after the ﬁnal gun of the
fresh game.

Ho:/as Stopped, 43-36

Way down yonder in New Orleans
they have a street named after (or
before) a Mr. Bassin. Today, the doors
are barred, the windows boarded up,
and the street deserted, but not half
so deserted as the Georgetown score
board would have been had not this
same Bassin been present Wednesday
evening in the Stadium pavilion.

I-ll Mr. Bassin did was score 18
points, or more than half of his team’s
total, as Pitt neared its third succes-
sive Eastern Intercollegiate Confer-
ence title by defeating the Capital
City ﬁve, 43-36, in an ultra-rough
brawl.

Bassin’s gang had the blues plenty
in the ﬁrst half, trailing, 28-11. at the
half. A new pass-score combination,
Noon to Rowe, clicked twice in rapid
succession to put Pitt ahead for good
in the ﬁrst two minutes of play. Coach
Mesmer’s hoyas couldn’t seem to get
set on their shots, playing erratic and
rough ba.ll during the ﬁrst period.

Georgetown’s ﬁery leader, Glbeau,
must have played on the opposite side
of “Canal Street (New Orleans), in the
Vieux Carre, from that of Brother
Bassin, for he just couldn’t seem to
hit the hoop consistently, However,
he did open a drive, picked up by Bas-
sin, that carried the Hoyas to within
seven points of Pitt with only ﬁve 1n1n-
utes remaining. .

Here, however, Bobby Johnson step-
ped in with his consistently ﬁne brand
of bail that stamps him as the coming
outstanding performer on the Panther
squad. Pete Noon shared in the rally
by contributing several of his now fa-
mous follow-ups (See Duqnesne) to
bring his total for the evening “D .t0

IG-4A Title-Event Tomorrow

Three new contenders were added
to the Panther party that left at
noon, yesterday, for the third Pan-
ther invasion of New York of the
indoor season. Tomorrow these three
aces who get their baptismal ﬁre in
"big-time” competition, Redmon Oden,
Franklyn Theriault, and Harold Tost,
join a quartet of relayers and the re-
cently-initiated Pete Bennett for the.
annual lC4A indoor‘ championships in

These eight performers, along with
W’. Don Harrison_. director of athletics.
and Coach Olson will arrive in New
York today. Coach Corr’s swimming
team will form a special rooting sec-

The same quartet that pushed Man-

Va rsity Natators
Co East To Meet
Manhattan Team

Varsity swimmers will head for
New York this evening, where they
will tangle with an Eastern Swimming
Association rival, Manhattan, tomor-
row afternoon in a dual meet.

While hopes for the league title
were dimmed by F & M two weeks
ago, the Panthers by trimming Man-
hattan can just about sew up second
place in the league standings. This
is their last cont'erence duel of the.
season.

Chances for a victory appear to be
bright inasmuch as both Tech and
Delaware, Panther victims, beat Man-
hattan in dual meets this season. Car-

negie had a close contest with the-

easterners, defeating them, 35-33.

Corr wil probably take an eight-
man team to New York, those being

l Panther Sluggers
To Battle Bisons

Mittmen Seek Third League Win
Against Bucknell Tomorrow

 

Seeking their second consecutive
ring triumph, the Panther boxers will
travel to Lewisburg to face the ‘Buck-
nell mittmen tomorrow night. Accord-
ing to Coach Jack Schricker, the squad
will leave the campus early Saturday
morning, making the trip in automo-
biles.

The Panthers will be favored to
drub the Bisons, since West Virginia
licked Bucknell, 6-2, while Schricker’s
proteges earned a 4-4 tie with the
Mountaineers earlier in the season.

A defeat will knock the Panthers
into second place in the Eastern In-
tercollegiate boxing conference, while
a victory will give them a ﬁrmer grip
on ﬁrst place.

Russ Vogel, diminutive Panther 115-
pounder. will be out to make Pitt fans
forget his last setback when he trades
punches with Stefano, Bucknell star.

Cap ain Al Paslowski, whose fast,
stinging left-jab carried him to victory
last week, will be out to repeat this
performance against Bailey of Buck-
nell.

Short, curly-haired Abe Konick will
try to shake off the “referee’s jinx,”
which has pestered him all season, in
his bout against Androski. Konick
dropped virtually all of his bouts this
year on disputed decisions, and looked
like a “sure” winner in the Temple
bout last week, but got only a draw.

provement in every match, gets the
nod against Ballard in the 145-pound
division_

Despite a long lay-off, Dines showed
flashes of rare form in defeating his
Owl opponent and will probably start
against Verga, the Bison middleweight.

Art Leonard, who scored a knockout
in his Temple bout and was the lone
Panther victor in the Wisconsin
match, seeks his third consecutive
victory when he faces Valentino in
the 165-pound mix-up.

Linderman and Patrick, who saw no
action in the Temple bouts, throw
leather against Mandrodt and Morre
to wind-up the evening’s festivities in
the 175-pound and heavyweight class-
es, respectively.

Charlety Congfoﬁf Cot Biggest ‘Kick’
Tossing Javelin For National Record

 

\Vhen the Greyhound bus roared through Nanty-Glo that June enroute
to State College for a meet with the'Nittany Lion track and ﬁeld teams,
few men in the Pitt bus realized that the home town boy they cheered
would one year later be headed west for the highest collegiate honors.

Charley Gongloff was just a. weight man then, throwing most anything

from the shot to the 35-pound weight. Charley was a consistent performer,

collegiate record for the javelin event.

International News Service flashed the word that an unknown, Charles
Gongloff o-f the University of Pittsburgh, was the new Intercollegiate jave-
lin champ and leader in the Nationals with the best mark compiled by a
collegiate performer in three years.
T0 Charley, “it Was a dream come true,” and undoubtedly
the biggest kick he has ever had in athletics.

Gongloff, overshadowed by Joe T'ormey, George Shotwell, and recent-
ly Nick Kliskey on the gridiron, served three campaigns as relief center to
this trio. Bob Hogans famous behind-the-goal kick that spelled defeat for
Notre Dame in 1932 was the best and most opportune “kick" Gongloff got
out of football. However, when his “shock-troopers” whipped or tied the
“varsity” in practice games, Charley thought this just about the “best kick

until last June. one year after that
trip through his home town, Nanty-
Glo.

Again it was Penn State against
Pitt, but this time Charley amazed
both teams when he picked up a stray
javelin and sent it hurtling 197 feet
to defeat Gene Taano, the Panther
sophomore sensation. At VVest Point,
the fans were still dubious about his
abilities with the spear, until he came
through with a 207-foot toss.

His spectacular throw up at West
Point won him a trip to the coast
where the National Intercollegiate
carnival was to be held in June.

On his ﬁrst cllicial toss, the ﬁrst
day of the NCAA championships,
Charley achieved the unexpected. All
that week he had watched others out-
throw him in practice, and as a result
observers took very little cognizance
of his chances for the title. When
the spear plunked into the ground,
the tape measure showed 221 feet,

Merit Panther Awards To Make Debut
Along With Mid-Semester Grades

 

After today there will be something
missing from the campus—the blue
and gold arm bands which have decor-
ated the arms of second-semester
freshman women since February 12.
This means the end of custom regula-
tions.

These arm bands displaced the
usual green ones after a test was tak-
en about the history, songs. faculty,
and student leaders of the University.
The test was given by the members
of the customs committee of V'SGA,
which acquaints freshman women with
life at the University.

l\-ierit Panthers, silver panther pins,
were given to freshman women who
attended events planned especially for
them. who maintained a one quality
point average with no failures or in-
complete work, complied with Cus-
toms Regulations, regularly attended
Senior Mentor meetings, passed Cus-
toms iest on the speciﬁed dates, show-
ed a true University spirit, and main-
tained a friendly attitude toward fresh-
man and upperclass women. the facul-
ty, and administration officers. The
pins will be (listributed when the
eight-weeks grades are received.

cle Francais de Freshmen, freshman
women's French unit, for a copy of

senling articles by the members of

modern languages, never ﬁnished the
second year of French in this Univer-
sity. yet he managed to complete sev-

en years of Latin and three years of
German.

A lLllGllllT SMOKE

OF RICH, RIPE-BODIED TOBACCO

All kinds of people choose Luckies,
each for reasons of his own. But every-
-one agrees that Luckies are A Light
Smoke of rich, ripe-bodied tobacco.
It is a rather surprising fact that the
leaves of the same tobacco plant may
vary far more than the leaves from
plants of quite different types. Chemical

analysis shows that the top leaves con-
tain excess alkalies which tend to give
a harsh, alkaline taste. The bottom
leaves tend to acidity in the smoke.
It is only the center leaves which ap-
proach in nature the most palatable,
acid-alkaline balance. In Lucky Strike
Cigarettes, the center leaves are used.

Luckies are less acid
