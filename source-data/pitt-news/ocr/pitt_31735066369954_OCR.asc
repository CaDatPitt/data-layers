Emptying The Shelves ‘

The convenience of food shop-
ping may end abruptly for Oak-
land consumers, including
hungry students, if contract dis-
putes between Giant Eagle
workers- and management are
not resolved by’ midnight,
Saturday. .

Contracts for meat cutters,
meat wrappers and deli workers
expire Saturday at midnight, and
the workers, members of the
United Food and Commercial

-Workers Local 23,, voted last

Sunday 522-9 to reject a contract
offer by Giant Eagle. Workers
have said that they will strike ‘if
an agreement is not reached by
Sunday. .
When asked where an'Oak-
_land resident would shop should‘
the Giant Ea‘gle,' thefbnly ‘major
food chain in the area, close, Jo
"Ann Turak, of the Peoples Oak-
land Community Group said,

1 “God only knows.”

The nearest, alternative super-
markets are the Kroger’s stores
in Shadyside and Bloomfield,
and the Foodland in Squirrel

_ Hill.

The major disputes between
the workers and the management
center around wage and beneﬁt
cuts and the installment of “in-
store" seniority as opposed to the
current policy, of “store-wide"
seniority, according, to- Richard
Flanagan, an organizer with the
Support Our Neighborhoods
Action Coalition (SNAC). This
group mounted a successful cam-
paign to stop the closing of

Nabisco’s East Liberty plant. ’

SNAC has tenativc plans to offer
shuttle service to inconvenienced
shoppers.

Giant Eagle is asking for wage
and benefit cuts that total nearly
$4.50 an hour. This would reduce
meat cutters’ wages to about $8

an hour.

“The company is doing a great
job in portraying tb the public
that all of the employees are
making thevtop wage,” Flanagan

said, “This is not true.”

According to Flanagan, many
of_ the Giant Eagle's employees
are part-time and have little or
no benefits. ‘

Members of the same union

their employers, Shop-N-Save

independently franchised.

“The union has in effect

Mexico Trip Offers Living Research

By ‘RON SMUTNY

Twelve Pitt students will have
an opportunity to travel to Mex-
ico during the spring session of
1984 to experience Mexican cul-
ture and carry out research pro-
jects through a program
sponsored by Pitt's Center for
Latin American Studies.

The trip, sponsored by the

Center For International Studies,

(UCIS), will take students to
Guanajuato, Mexico, for seven

and one-half weeks and will be‘

preceded by a three-credit
seminar in the winter term for the
12 students selected from
approximately 30 applicants.
The final selections are ‘made
through extensive interviews

and his assistants. The actual
research trip is worth six credits,
making the entire program
worth nine credits to the student.

The trip will be led by Pitt his-'
tory‘ professor Harold Sims.
Sims said the students will
develop research projects on
which to work while in Mexico in
the seminar and will also learn all
they can about the local econ-
omy, geography and social and-
political issues.

Sims po_inted out that not only
will the trip he a great expe-
rience, but also a great bargain.
The entire trip will cost the stu-
dents $375 plus tuition and
includes round-trip ‘airfare, in-
country excursions, plus room
and boardwith a Mexican host

" family. The $375 price isreally

only about one-third. of the total

be provided by the center a
through externalfunding. Sims '
said going on this trip “probably
costs less than it would cost the

students to stay in Pittsburgh

during that time.’’ a _
Sims said that the trip is for

A anyone, noting that the students

on such trips tend to come from
many different academic
backgrounds.

Shirley Krieger, one of the
trip’s coordinators, said the pro:
gram provides students with an
opportunity to do theirresearch
projects in an area of interest to
them on the undergraduate level.

Even more important, accord-
ing to Krieger, is the “actual '
experience of , living with a host
family in a foreign government."

The Student Government Board
Elections Committee voted Wednes-
day to disqualify board candidate
Laura Eliason from the upcoming
race due to a violation of the election
code. ,

Eliason," who said she misinter-
preted the rule, was disqualified for
hanging election posters 12 days
before the start of the official.cam-
paign period. _

According to the official com-
plaint received bygcommittee chair-
man Jim Brady, one of the other
board candidates spotted the posters
and reported the infraction, to the
Student" Government office. ' . .

“There was never, a-question, of

decide whether or not ignorance of

The final vote was 6-2 against the
candidate. The pair voting to have

rules, however, there is only one pro-
vision made for violating the code —

“I'm sure they disqualified me on
behalf of all the candidates that will

The Student Government Board

"is considering another way of

increasing communication between
student organizations and the
board, and the possibility of rein-
stating a student assembly was sug-

According to the bylaws of the
assembly, representatives from all

recommendations to the Student

Government Board on various areas
of concern to the student commun-

ity,” Davis said.

The assembly would be required
to meet at least twice a term, but it
can meet more often if it desires.

From Aristotle to Argentina: Lectures Fill Air

Citizen vs. The State,  
Defining the Roles A

By ussus ROSS

Because of the way our society
is today, and because we are liv-
ing in an enclosed geographical
area, citizens and the state are at
odds with one another, accord-
ing to the moderator of an inter-
national studies forum.

Ben Bart of e Western Euro-

pean Studies rogram said that
the individual stands on his or
her own rights, conflicting with
those of the state, which stands
on its own.
0 Bart delivered his remarks yes-
terday as he introduced three
professors at the University Cen-
ter for International Studies
Roundtable discussion.

Hans-Peter Stahl, represent-
ing the Classics department,
cited the ancient philosopher
Aristotle to emphasize that each
citizen shares in the administra-
tion ofjustice. Many ofthe inter-
actions that develop in a
confrontation favor “many, not
few,” meaning that the state is
more important than the individ-
ual in matters of democracy.

Stahl was joined in the discus-
sion by Fredrick Whelan of the

A political science department and

Helena Goscilo from the Slavic
department.

Whelan said that he believes
there are two ‘dichotomies con-
cerning citizens and their obliga-
tions to the state: public «vs.
‘private life and individual vs. the
state. Kr’

Does a person’s duty lie in his
responsibilities to himself or to
society? Whelan said that there
are problems with making the
state more important than the
individual. 0

Concerning the second dichot-
omy, Whelan said there is a need
for strong support of the individ-
ual so that he can be liberated
from a society of rules.

Goscilo said the quality of the
response to an individual’s
action determines the way that
individual behaves in a state.

Goscilo added that individuals
desire to make civic commit-
ments to themselves and to oth-
ers, but, she said, because
consistency rarely rules our lives,
we often seek solitude and
remove ourselves from public
life.

The take

actions, Goscilo said.

Congressman William Coyne
spoke to the Graduate school of
International and Public Affairs
yesterday about the questioned
need for additional U.S. funds
for the International Monetary
Fund and the Export-Import
Bank.

The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) is an organization ’
of 146 nations whose function is
“to promote international mone-
tary cooperation and to help in
the expansion and balance of
-trade," Coyne said. “To that end,
the IMF makes loans, especially
to developing nations, to correct
disfunctions in a given nation’s
balance of payments.”

The IMF gets its money from
quotas assessed to the member
nations. In 1982, the IMF Quota
assessed to the U.S. was $111
million. The new U.S. quota is to
be $8.2 billion, an increase of
47.4 percent. Coyne pointed out,
however that this figure repres-
ents only four percent of’ the
world’s total imports, and only
one percent of the U.S. capital
market. -

The U.S. quota is 20.6,percent
of the IMF’s total income. Coyne
said the increases are being
assessed because of the rising
debts of developing nations such
as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina,
60 percentof the total debt due to
a fall in oil prices, high interest
‘rates and the stalled economies
of these nations.

In the face of a $200 billion

federal deficit, ‘Coyne supported

  

Coyne Calls for increased IMF Funding

the increase by saying that in
doing so, “We will be reacting to
the world as it is, not as we wish it
might be".

Coyne also stated that failure
for the U.S. to contribute could
have “a distinctly ‘negative
impact, not only on the econo-
mies but on our own economy”
as well. ‘

Coyne cited that 20.percent of
all U.S. producton of goods goes

I a;% rcen

vital.‘ -

of those goods go to desveloping
nations. He added that eight out
of 10 newjobs created in the U.S.
over the last 12 years were a
direct result of exports, and that
every $1 billion in exports equals
25,000 U.S. jobs, so support of
the IMF supports employment.

Coyne also said that jobs can
be protected through increased
support of the Export-Import
bank, which promotes American

  

approvals.

Represti llllam Coye, speaking yesterdy at
Pitt, said the United States’ contributions to the IMF were '

exports by loaning money to for-
eign buyers at low interest rates,
“thereby. increasing the demand
for our products,” he said. “In
addition, the band helps provide
exporters with insurance against
political and economic risks
overseas.”

In his closing remarks, Coyne
said that “Our commitment to

direct effect on international sta-

A Tale ofTwo Minds

By MARTY. WILLIS‘

Will computers ever by capable of
thinking and speaking as intelli-
gently and creatively as human? The

evidence is very hard "to read,'

according to Pitt philosophy profes-
sor John Haugeland. ,

. Speaking Wednesday in a lecture
entitled “What Is Artificial Intelli-
gence?” sponsored by the University
Honors Program, Haugeland said

that the study of artificial intelli-

gence represents “a new way of stu-
dying our own minds.”
“Computers [already] do some
things that are rather like thinking,”
Haugeland said. In the ‘distant
future, it may become possible to
develop highly “intelligent” compu-
ters “that are as intelligent as people
in as broad and deep a way as people
are, ” he said. He cited speech behav-

 

between conscious and unconscious
processes, so nobody knows exactly
how to transfer that difference to
computers,” Haugeland said. He
indicated that the unconscious
dimension of human intelligence
may represent an insurmountable
gap for computers to bridge in any
attempt to match the creative level

_ of people.

Some philosophers have hypo-
thesized that “the meaningfulness of
words and symbols deries exclu-
sively from the meaningfulness of
thoughts,” according to Haugeland.

“Where does meaning originate?
Thoughts can have original mean-
ing, unlike words and symbols,” he
explained,but one question is still
unresolved — from what does the
meaningfulness of thought derive?
This question is what Haugeland has
coined “the mystery of original

.“Nobody really knows what the
essential difference is in humans
  between conscious and unconscious
processes, so nobody knows exactly

hoe to transfer
computers."

—John Haugeland, philosophy

r professor

p that process to

 

 

ior as the most critical area of future
comparison.

“If artificial intelligence is to.suc-
ceed in the way, certain assumptions
will need to be tested,” Haugeland
said. Perhaps most problematic is
the notion that computers will only
need more of the same capabilities
they now have in order to match
those of people. “The question is
.whether that’s enough,” he said.

. “Nobody really knows what the. “
essential difference isﬁin‘ humans

meaning.”
That mystery has relevance for
artificial intelligence technology,

according to Haugeland. Compu-

ters are currently able to work with
words, symbols and numbers only.
If the computer world will always be
a world of symbols and words, will

they ever really be able to think and '

create as we do? _ ’
Nobody knows the answer‘ in‘
I983, but Haugeland offers one

  Opinion

  It’s About
Time

After six years of waiting, hoping and wishing,

Pitt will finally have its own FM radio station in .

the next six to 12 months.

Last week, WPGH received a construction -

license from the Federal Communications Com-
mission (FCC), the last step in the long, often
drawn—out process of obtaining FM status.
WPGH will have to change its call letters
because of aconﬂict with WPGH—TV and will'be
located at 98.5 on the FM dial. Predictions have

' been madethat the station will be able to reach

between one and a half and two million people.
The implications of the FM status are quite
great. In the next year, both the Office of Student
Activities and all academic departments are
going to have to work together to help the station
make the switch. , '
Since the station will be reaching so many peo-
ple who are not affiliated with Pitt in any way,
some drastic changes need to be made and new
features need to be implemented. . ‘
For example, both on-air and off-air students
need to be trained in broadcasting, news report-
ing, public affairs and all other areas that com-
prise a radio station.
WPGH will be ~“the voice of Pitt” to many
people outside the dorms, and it_will have to
make a favorable, professional impression on the

T Pittsburgh community.

The F M status will also open‘up a whole new
academic field at Pitt — the field of broadcasting.
‘If investigated and utilized, the station would
make the perfect training ground for students
interested in entering the field of radio.

Not only could they receive classroom training,
but on-the—job experience as well — a necessity in
today’s job market. As it stands now, students
who wish to enter‘ thatparticular field have to
take time out from their hectic academic lives and

join the station as part of their extracurricular lg

activities. ,
‘ All of Pitt should be proud of the future FM

status of WPGH and should join together so that ’

it is a success for both the students and the
university.

Teacher Relieves MidtermBluesi

By CHRIS BOSSO

Students, particularly freshmen,
never fail to pose a numberiof pre-
dictable questions to their teachers

at the start of each term. As a public.

service to both students and
teachers, and to save time, I provide
stock answers to these oft-asked
queries:

Q: Do we have to read the
assigned books?

A: Of A course not. I only assign
these books for two reasons: (l).The
authors are good friends, and”they
return a percentage of their royalties
to me as a kickback. I do the same
for them. How do you think we can
afford our summer cabins in Maine?
(2) To make you look good. Imagine
how you can impress your girl/ boy-

friend with two shelves of hardbacks ‘
. alongside your Miller Lite and Styx

posters. Books are made to be seen,
. not read. - i

Q: Are lectures important?

A: No, particularly not on Friday
afternoons, Monday mornings or
any night when the Keg has cheap
beer. Lectures are unnecessary any-
way — most students use the time to
do crossword puzzles or write hate-
letters to The Pitt News editorial
staff. And they pass.

Q: Do we have to write a paper?

A: A waste of your abilities.
Besides, I would have to read them.

Q: What is ‘on the midterm / final
exam? .
A: I forget, but you can refresh my

memory with a $20 bill folded inside \

a piece ‘of paper.

Q: Do we need to -take notes?

A: I don’t. Why should you?

Q: Do spelling and grammar
count on exams? '
' A: Of course not. Who needs com-
plete sentences, accurate spelling or

correct punctuation anyway? Will it

get you a job with Atari?

 

Q: Which is .more important for
the exam, the book or your lectures?
A A: Both, and neither. I take 43.4
percent of the exam questions from
the book and 32.7 percent from my

. lectures. The rest I just make up after.

a half-bottle of Jack Daniels. And I
use the same test each term no mat-
ter what I’m teaching.

remainder are graded accordingfto
how far they make it across the lawn,
indicating various degrees of God’s

uncertainty about answers.
Q: Can we come to see you during

office hours?

A: No way. Office hours exist only I

Vandalism Burns Up   Reader

Dear Editor:

The Oct. 5 article concerning‘
the vandalism of the student
union really burnt me up. The
smasing of the atrium’s windows
was really the last straw. Since
arriving here ﬁve weeks ago, I
have dismissed countless other
“minor” acts of such destruction

as being “pranks” or “all in fun,”
but this is
inexcusable.
Many people complain that
our campus is a dump, but this
place can only be as nice as we
keep it. How manyyof these said
complainers think nothing of
throwing paper all over the place

completely

or something as extreme as-
throwing “glass objects” at the‘
union? Let’s go people! When is
everybody going to realize that
this place is our home? So let’s
start acting like it is.

Life’s Bureaucracies Perturbs Ptt Student

Dear Editor:

"The term “service industries" is a
buzz-word frequently used by
government officials and the media

‘ when referring to non-manufactur-

ing fields and occupations. We have
been led to believe that the service
industries will rescue the dislocated
factory workers from_the unemploy-
ment line and will be the new source
of economic growth in the United
States. (Both these assertions are
highly debatable!)-

Dissecting the term on a literal
basis, I found Webste__r’s definition

  

 

of service including “helpful,”
“friendly action,” “giving assist-
ance” and “performing for another.”
Contrasting these descriptions with
the current caliber of work per-
formed in these fields, I feel that the
term “service industries” is grossly

- inappropriate.

I canrecall a period when I would
feel compelled to write a letter to a
faceless big shot whenever! was mis-
treated by one of his or her
employees; I now. feel the urge to

“When I get to it."

These sentiments may be seen by
Pitt students when attempting to
deal with the university’s organiza-
tional structure. It is amazing that
some enterprises make a profit in
spite of their employees or that some
bureaucratic workers have not been
dismissed despite civil service pro-
tection and uncaring managers.

I am not professing that all
workers in‘ such fields are lazy,
insensitive, economic leeches. There
are many caring professionals who

enjoy helping people and take pride
in ajob well done; Ijust feel they are
becoming a minority.

I will not delve into organiza-
tional behavior, socio-economic
theories, etc. in order to explain the
causes or justify the state of “service
industries.” It would not change the
fact that the consumer has to toler-
ate less than adequate treatment
while spending those scarce dollars.

Behavior ‘Unbecoming’ I 

Dear Editor:

This is an open letter to Coach
Fazio. Since your loss to WVU, your
second in a row, the papers have
been full "of little elsethan excuses‘
for those losses. The fans are too-
noisy, the referees are partial to the
other team, an accident here and a
fluke. there. This sort of behavior is
unbecoming a coach of a major col-
lege power, as well as childish and
cheap.

You claim/the loss to. WVU was
mainly because the spectators made
so much noise the team was unable
to hear the calls. That noise you

‘heard was something called team

support and loyalty. If that much

volume of support is unknown to I

you; it boils down tqtwo reasons.
First, those who should be sup-

Krieger praised such programs

‘because they provide the stu-

dents with interest in the interna-
tional ‘sphere, including
international affairs, politics and
government. Many of the stu-
dents later obtain jobs in some
realm of international studies.

Krieger stressed the fact that
students are conducting research
on these trips and that the trips
are part of an accredited course,
unlike some international studies
trips on which only basic course
work is performed.

In past years, the center has
sponsored field programs to
Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela,
Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala and
the Dominican Republic. '

Pitt student Laura Mengon is
one of the students who traveled
to the Dominican Republic this
past spring, and she found it to
be a very rewarding experience.

“The trip gave me a better
understanding of Hispanic cul-
tures and greatly improved my
Spanish speaking abilities,” she
said. ¥

According to Mengon, the trip
also gave her .a much greater

awareness of poverty and other V

world problems.

Preserving The/lmerican Way

Dear Showcase:

thank you for the wonderful article
written by Richard Sater concerning
the Waitresses. ' .

I went to Heaven that night, and
the sound system was lousy. They

were an hour late, but with lyrics
like "I found a cure for gravitylyes
I'm addicted; to roofs and jets," and
songs like "Let’s Leave This Party,”
they are truly a refreshing change.
I thought for sure Showcase would
slam them, and I was ecstatic that
you didn't. (Almost, but not nearly as
ecstatic as I was over meeting Patty
D.) _, '

,,Pittsbargh Ballet Theatre Open   On I Its

By LINDA HENRY

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
opened its 1983-84 season last week-
end with a startling spectacle of
unusual choreography.

The first dance, Raymonda Variations,
choreographed by the late George
Balanchine, considered by many to be
the greatest choreographer in ballet’s
history, was a joyous expression of
classical movement and plotless

 form. Balanchine's motto was ”Per-

fection is the only standard.” He
would have been pleased with the
PBT rendition of his dance, especially
the performances of principal
dancers Evelyne Desutter and Ken-
neth Nickel. .

The French~born and trained
Desutter, although somewhat
smaller than the girls in the support-
ing company of dancers, has a power-
ful presence on stage. Watching herlis

magical sensitivity.

Nickel is a native Pittsburgher who
joined the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
in 1976. He is exciting to watch as he
takes command of the stage with his
undeniably masculine grace.

The second number performed by
the company sent some audience
members heading for the exits. Ballet
snobs who couldn't bear to watch as
the dancers .appeared on stage
(females included) wearing red satin
matador-style pants, white shirts and
thin red "ties. (These are the same

people who walk out of Shakespeare
performances if the actors are not
dressed in_Eliz_abethan garb).

The dance, titled Late Afternoon, was
choreographed by Belgian Luk de
Layress. Despite the unorthodox cos-
tumes and the Latin-flavored music
composed by Astor Piazzola, the
dance movements divided into seven
”tangos” were classic and precise;

playful, yet defined by the same disci- _ ~

plined control as any plotted antique
ballet.

Standout dancers were Mireille
Leterrier and the dynamic men: Brian
Bloomquist, Pablo Savoye and Scott
Jovovich.

The final dance performed Friday
night was Actuations: Stravinsky, with
choreography, commissioned for the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, by Daniel
Levans. This was. a stripped-down
dance done to music by the man
whom Balanchine once
remarked, ”without Stravinsky,
ballet would have died." The dancers
wore only leotards and tights as they
performed pure ballet movements
with a mime-like quality. As the tran-
sitions grew to include the entire
ensemble and the pace quickened, it
was a stirring end to a unique night in
the ballet theatre.

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre will
perform next on Oct. 31 through

. Nov. 2 with two worldpremieres;

and from Dec. 26 through 31 dancing
the perennial classic, Nutcracker. For
information, call 281-0360‘.

Mamet’s ‘The Woods’:

0 By IONATI-IAN KUNKEL .,

When the pre-show music begins
and the house lights fade on the pic-
turesque and unmasked set, one is
ready for a love story. The Woods, play-
ing at Pitt's Studio Theatre, is just
that, but playwright David Mamet
presents it in a way that is rarely
seen. _

The story, set in the" ,woods, is
about Nick and Ruth, unmarried lov-

stilted behavior throughout most of
the show. She seems to be aware that
people are watching her and that they

‘are on all sides of her — one of the
‘disadvantages of acting in the arena-'

ment, though, and seems to always

CI-IELLE  HRITZ
 
AS TIME GOES BY
By Elaine Bissell
Pocket Books

In this age of women's lib and the
fight for equal rights, there has been
a multitude of books written about
women "trying to find themselves."
Some books will linger in our minds
for a long time to come, and others
we will forgetassoon as we turn the
last page.

As Time Goes By is one of the latter
types. .

The story revolves around three
women —— Jenny, Liz and Kate -— who

meet while in a maternity ward on i

the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, after
each of them had‘ just given birth to
her first csnild. Their husbands are in
the arme services stationed in —

I you guessedit — Pearl Harbor.

Well, of course, the husbands are
killed, and the three are faced with
the. task of raising theirchildren
alone. Up to this point, the book has
great potential to be a tribute to

’ working women _who are forced to

work in order to support themselves
and their children, but the book falls
short of that; the book also would
have had a better impact because of
the period of time in which the major-
ity of it takes place.

After Jenny, Liz and Kate leave the
hospital, they seem to adjust quite
well to the fact that they have to go’
out and work for a living; they don't
even have a tough time finding jobs.
They don't work in factories like

Rubi éoloaﬁél‘

  

many women did during World War
II. They find jobs in advertising, act-

ing and newspaper reporting; fields '

that were particularly forbidden to
women in those days

The rest of the book centers
around the loves and lives of Jenny,
Liz and Kate as they remarry, settle
into their careers and raise their Pearl
Harbor babies. ,

A good point of the book deals with
the historical. accuracy. The World

~ War II timeline is correct and paints a

vivid picture of the events leading up
to and including D-Day. One of the
characters is affected by McCarthy's
witchhunt, and the book finally ends
a day before President Kennedy's
assassination.

As Time Goes By lacks one crucial
element, though, that is needed in a
book of this nature: character devel-
opment. One finds it difficult to feel
for the women as they experience the
major disappointments in life. They
seem like actors playing out a part,

- who are unaffected by the day—to-day

developments that surround them.
Only one of the characters, Jenny,

has any amount of depth to her.

Jenny was a career women who had
convinced the editor of a New York
newspaper that she could handle. a
reporter's job. After becoming preg-
nant (she wasn't ‘married at the time
but was talked into it by the father),

she was fired by the newspaper

because she was a wifeand a mother.

Through the majority of the book,
Jenny tries to break down the sexual
barriers that block ‘her because she is
a woman, and she does succeed. The

other two accept the barriers and live '

within them, suffering needlessly.
Jenny is refreshing because she is

v an 1980s’ woma-n before her time,_but

that doesn't stop herlfrom attaining
her goals.

' /is Time Goes By is not a ”must read"
by anyone's standards, but it is easy
reading and more interesting than all
those other "women's books." It has’

little sex, no men on white horses and ‘

no damsels in distress. p

RUBE GOLDBERG:
A RETROSPECTIVE
Commentary by Philip Garner
Delilah
"Accomplishing by complex means
‘what seemingly could be done
simply" defines a Rube Goldberg
invention. Goldberg (1883-1970), a

Pulitzer Prize—winning cartoonist,
invented monumental Better Mouse-
traps, using only his pen and paper
and imagination. His moveable parts
were midgets, cats, dogs, matches,‘
firecrackers, wheels, string, pulleys,
flowers, balloons, towels, the occa-
sional swordfish or polar bear_.... '

He built alarm clocks and auto jacks

— and various safety devices weekly in

his newspaper strip. Conventions
and all laws of gravity and probability
were ignored, and his cartoons are
still classics. Rube Goldberg: A Retrospec-

call her, and when he does show up,
he proceeds to disappear for days at a
time. Exhausted from the music busi-
ness and her relationship with Brian,
Lindel hides away in her apartment
for several . months, drinking and
smoking too muchand letting the
take—out boxes pile up. But, a record

exec's wife (who has designs on the  V

lovely Lindel) talks her into ‘going
away to Paris, where Lindel is con-
fronted by a starstruck fan who tells
her that her music "helped me get
through some really bad times" and
asks her when she's going to make a
new album. Lindel suddenly realizes
what her life is all about — music —
and, rejuvenated, she returns to New
York to put her‘ life back in order.
And that, my dear dreamers of
groupie-dom, is the insipid story of



Walk On Glass, a book which only adds '

to the idea that all rock singers/musi-
cians are s.tupid, pampered brats who
either drink too much or take too
many drugs and who are unable_to
hold together a relationship.

This book is especially disappoint-

ing because it was written by Lisa

Robinson, the near-legendary rock
columnist who first started the
infamous "Eleganza" column in
CREEM years ago, and who now
writes a syndicated column and is the
host for "Radio 1990" on "Night
Flight." Robinson is one of the most
respected journalists in the enter-
tainment field, but she's nota fiction
writer. Her characters are comprised
of several one-dimensional ones
grafted onto one another. Lindel, for
example, seems to be a bit of Stevie
Nicks, Laura Nyro, Pat Benatar and a
few others which, when rolled into
one character lessens the degree of
believablity that the book has, or
could have had. No one could dispute
that Robinson knows the world of
non-fiction like the back of her hand,
but she ought to leave fiction like
Walk On Glass to people like Judith»
Krantz. ' I

THE FRIENDLY COMPUTER
BOOK: A SIMPLE GUIDE FOR
ADULTS .

By Gene Brown Bantam Books

ELECTRONIC LIFE: HOW TO
THINK ABOUT COMPUTERS

By Michael Crichton

Alfred A. Knopf

All three of these books fall into the
same genre; apparently, book editors
in publishing houses feel that 40-
year-old executives have some sort of
gap intheir knowledge of computers
and what they can do with them. This
type of book can be dismissed rather
cynically as a trendy potboiler, but
those who are not really familiar with
computers would be the last to say
this.

Of the three books, by far the most
useful to anyone other than the
novice is Thexlllustrated Computer Diction-
ary. This bookyhas a number of useful
terms (over 1,000) and illustrations
to boot. Both the-neophyte and the
dedicated computer hack should be

able to find concepts and things in ‘

here that they did not know before. It
is at its best when it comes to deci-
phering al? -5 the acronyms that have
been devi ,.' -;3y electrical engineers
and computer science majors to des-
cribe corrséuter protocol.

A Arcane ‘terms like V ”I-IIT,S" and
’’PAB)('’ are there too, fully defined.
In fact, the real usefulness of this par-
ticular book may not be in the pres-
ent, but in the near future, when
some of the present technology has
become obsolete, and people working
with computers need to know the
meaning of some term that has gone
out of vogue. I

The Friendly Computer Book is indeed
as cordial as its name implies, but it is
also confusing. Brown cannot seem
to make up his mind whether it is a

history or how-to book, and itsuffers _

as a result. Brown writes compe-
tently — the information is there -
but an awful lot of history is there as
well. This is nice for someone who
desires to know the origins of mod-
ern computing, but for those who
would like to know how to pick out a
computer for home orbusiness pur-
poses, scads of_ information would
have to be sifted out before a reason-
able conclusion could be drawn.-
From an experienced user's stand-
point, however, the most galling
comment the book makes is on the
rear cover. ”Computers are like new
friends; get to know them and you
can always rely on them.” What kind
of stuff is this guy snorting, anyway?
But this is nothing compared to
Crichton’s Electronic Life. This book
manages to pull itself away from the
potboilers, but bar.ely. Self-
indulgence is written all over this
book — almost as if Chrichton said to
himself, "I need money and know lots

I about computers, so I'll write a book

and make a quick buck.”

On'the bright side of things (such
as they are), Crichton’s prose is very
readable and littered with anecdotes,
such as this one on computer prob-

lems: ”It’s amazing how many com— V

pany presidents know how to fix
computers.” Also, in the appendix are
some» useful programs that would
enable a novice to really get in touch
with his new'IBM PC or Apple II. The

paternalistic style works to Crich-I
- ton’s advantage here; it is really hard

to get angry‘ at this work. There is,
however, no excuse for him- to be
needlessly self-indulgent with his
knowledge of modern computing.

TRIO AND ERROR
Trio
Mercury/PolyGram "

If you were aware of a song
released last year called "Da Da
Da," then you probably know
that it was a stupefyingly sim-
plistic song that was saved by its
idiocy. Okay, so it was fun. But
who would have guessed that
the group responsible — three
Germans who call themselves
Trio —— could actually record a
whole album of material that
was worth listening to? Proba-
bly nobody, but they have, and
it's called Trio And Error (the

giving Trio /ind Error the feeling
of cohesiveness that it has, des-
pite the radical differences
between individual song styles.
Some cuts, like the aforementi-
oned "Da Da Da," are
synthesizer-oriented, while
"Out In The Streets” (no, -not
Bruce's song) and "Bye Bye” are
slow, honky-tonk blues
numbers, the likes of which
haven't been heard since the
Stones circa '72. A lot of the lyr-

ics are in German, and there's ,

even a reggae-ish version of
"Tutti-Frutti" that seems as if

;//:

it's sung in German, although
the sleeve says it's done in Eng-

cuteness continues).
These guys have a penchant

for the witty lyric and the dead-
pan delivery. Most of the songs
don't make a whole lot of sense,
but individual phrases often,
and satirically, hit home. Take
the lovelorn singer of "Hearts
Are Trump," for example: I
dream a lot of lo_ve—boolcs and of sex
and all‘ that stuff/I dream so/much
about it ‘cause I don't have it enough/
And I don't sleep so well —— I think
that's why I drink so much. Every-.
thing is sung in the flattest of
emotional range, adding to the

overall humor of the release and

lish. The strangest song of all,
however, is one called "7:;a0ra-
looralooraloo," which  cls as
if Lawrence Welk com; ".2 ~ -it as
accompaniment to Bob JEICI Cis-

'sy's dancing. Weird.

Supposedly, "the rest  the
musical world has already disco-
vered Trio" (this, according to
the bio sheet), and from the
sounds of Trio And Error, it's no
wonder why. C'mon,
America———get with it.

. LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

NO. 8
J.J.Cale
Polygram

Truth is, it's hard to get
excited over an old pro like J.J.
Cale when new kids like Stevie
Ray Vaughn and Double Trou-
ble are burning up the block

T with much more fiery interpre-

tations ’of R&B.

The era of the slow-hand is
waning, and along with it, musi-
cians like Cale and even Eric
Clapton are losing their spark.
Yes, they are some of the best
guitarists in the business, but
they're boring. ' ‘ ‘V ,y

I In fact, NO. 8 sounds quite
like an Eric Clapton release with
a touch more lethargy to it.
There's plenty of backwoodsy
guitar riffs from Cale and other
six-stringers like Richard
Thompson, replete with that
Tex-Mex aroma, but there's
Nery little excitement value.
"Losers" sounds like a remake of
"Tulsa Time," and who wants to
hear another version of that?
The rest is more-of the same,
except for "Reality," which is
reminiscent of Mark Knopfler's
Dire Straits and "Takin' Care
Of Business,” which is the-only
tune that grabs attention (It is
not a cover of Bachm'an—Turner
Overbore’s hit).

Of course those who do find
J.J. Cale and Eric Clapton enter-
taining will find NO.8 likeable,

‘ _even admirable; the rest of us

will just roll over and snore a lot.

FRANRHDIGIACOMO

"Puttin' on the Ritz"l"Cheek to

Cheek"
Taco
RCA

Stop this guy, someone;
please. He calls himself Taco —
no, that's not ‘why he's danger-
ous, although it's‘ good

-circumstantial evidence. But

what this guy is really guilty of
is heartless desecration of ven-
erable Irving Berlin‘ tunes. "Put—
tin’ on the Ritz" belongs to
Clark Gable, whose song-and-
dance version highlights the
film Idiot's Delight‘ (1939), and
"Cheek to Cheek" is tailored for

Fred Astaire‘ and Ginger Rogers

in Top Hat (1935); they are
perfect.

Taco is modern. His whiny
and affected voice is glued onto
cotton-candy synthesizings,
electronic backing vocals and a
"Stars on 45" rhythm track. It's
blasphemy of the most execra—
ble sort, and he actually takes
liberties‘ with the lyrics —
"Cheek" becomes a rap—type
number before it's done, and
"Ritz" has been discreetly
altered to remove "questiona-
ble" references.

The fact that such bastardiza-
tions can slide as high as
number four on the Top 40 indi-
cates a melancholy future for
pop music. The situation may
change, however. Remember,
only you can prevent Taco.

RICHARD SATER

PASSIONWORKS  
Heart ‘
Epic
Women are one of the major
forces in today's rock — just

 

I look at the Motels, Missing Per-

sons, Pat Benatar, etc. Passion-
works is an album that reminds

A the listener of theladies who

started it all: Ann and Nancy

.Wilson of Heart.

Heart has successfully kept
on top of the last decade's music
scene .with a variety of hits,
from the hard rock of the early
'70s like "Barracuda" and
"Heartless", to acoustic classics
like "Dog and Butterfly" and
"Song of the Archer,” to softer
rock such as "Tell It Like It Is"
and "Bebe Le Strange." Passion-
works is for the most part a revi-
talizedl sound for Heart,
exemplified by album's current
singles, "How Can I Refuse"and
"Allies," written by Journey
keyboardist Jonathan Cain.

Ann Wilson's voice is once
‘again the album's outstanding
powerhouse. Sister Nancy and
lead guitarist Howard Leeserare
at their usual proficiency with
the instrumental and back-
ground vocal blending. New

bassist Mark ‘Andes (formerly
of Spirit and Eirefall) and
drummer Denny Carmassi (for-
merly of Gamma, Montrose and
‘Sammy Hagar's band) fit nicely
into Heart's formula of the Wil-
son sisters’ (with collaborator
Sue Ennis) poetic love lyrics and

A good hard rockin'.

Aside from "How Can I
Refuse" and "Allies," the ‘other
outstanding cuts from Passion-
works (produced by Keith Olson,
who's also produced albums for
Fleetwood Mac and Pat
Benatar) are "Sleep Alone,"
"Blue Guitar," "Johnny Moon"
and "Beat By Jealousy."

The rest’ has its good,

moments but tends to fall more
into the band's previous sound.

Overall, Passionworks -..is a,
worthy offering from the pre-

mier ladies of rock and defi-.

nitely worth a good listen to
anyone who considers himself a
fan of good rock.

IS NOTHING SACRED?
The Lords of the New Church
A & M

Post-punk catalysm at its fin-
est. That's what you'd have to
call The Lords of the New
Church's second album, Is
Nothing Sacred? This new release
definitely confirms the band's
musical inclination toward psy-
chedelia. Yet, unlike most other
groups, this band has adapted to
a diversified sound in the post-
punk era. _

Brian James, notorious for his
lacerating guitar lick while he
was still playing havoc with The
Damned, is once again in top-
notch form; however, the bite
of James’ guitar isn't so fero-
cious compared to the work he
did on the Lord's debut album.
And of course, Stiv Bators, rec-
ognized for his past vocal work
with the lesser-known and
now-extinct Dead Boys, pro-
vides -us with a touch of moral
decadence in his penetrating
lyrics.

In their earlier days, Bators J

and James clearly were the driv-

ing forces in their respective-

bands. Now, they take on the
same roles — collaborating and
writing every song on the new
album.

It's hard to think that many
people still have a stereotyped
vision of the Lords as an assort-
ment of hard-core punk refu-
gees. OK. you might think this
way because of the radical musi-
cal approach they've had in their
past, but this is just not the case
at hand. These guys have some-
thing to say about corruption in
the world today, and they do it

"with a no-nonsense, straight-

forward approach.

LORDS OF THE NEW CHURCHWW

Repetitive in theme? Maybe.
But there's no loss of musical
creativity on the vinyl. For the
most part, their remake of the
Grass Roots’ hit "Live for
Today" takes on a radically new
approach of grasping life one
day at a time.

Todd Rundgren helped the

band produce that track, even
though many ‘Rundgren faith-
ful would not be able to distin-
guish his influence on the cut.

The ominous overtones of
"The Night is Calling" prepares
the narrator for a pilgrimage of
salvation into the darknessgln
the midst of a chaotic society,
the narrator feels this can be the
only release. "A Tale of Two
Cities" provides us with a vivid,
apocalyptic view of our "world
of tomorrow."

But amidst this refinement of
psychedelia stands ‘one unique
song, co-written by Bators and
James; ”Dance With Me," the
opening track of the album,

, introduces, for the first time on

the LP, the use of the sax and
trumpet. The interjection of the
brass adds a new twist to the
Lords’ musical integrity and the
deviation unmistakably enhan-

ces this outstanding cut.

The Lords of the New Church
are here for now. And, though
I'm sure they can feel the pres-
sure from many non-
enthusiasts, just remember:

pressure sometimes makes a

diamond.

"first live album. We already

"across America and Europe"
and make sure she sounds bear-

No, this can't'be. She's?

drowned out by her husband's
guitars on "Hit Me With Your
Best Shot" and "I Want Out."
That's okay, cause she sounds
just fine on "Fire And Ice" and
"I-Ieartbreaker." Should we
include ”Shadows of the Night,"
"Treat Me Right" or "Little Too
Late”? Or should we toss in the
leftovers from Get Nervous,
(”Love Is A Battlefield” and
”Lipstick Lies")? Now.,_ now
remember, we wouldn't want

the record to be a flop, now
would we?

And let's make sure we thank
everybody appropriately, even
if they don't deserve it. Should
we include her hairdresser?

J Maybe not, it might come across‘
. as narcissistic. Oh, but we can't

forget the audiences "who are
so much a part of this record."
It's a line of bullshit, yes, but"so
is the rest of this.

As the full auditorium indicated,

_ Americans have not tired of Secret

Service Agent 007, especially since it
is the second James Bond film
released in the space of only six
months. However, instead of Roger
Moore, Sean Connery returns to play
the aging Bond in Irvin Kershner’s
Never Say Never Again.

Most persons over 12 can recite the
Bond formula as equal to whirlwind
action plus spectacular scenery plus
society destroyers plus beautiful
women. Never fills all of these varia-
bles in a magnetically witty unfolding
of Bond fighting sharks, Bond
chained to a magnificent fortress in
Southern France, Bond battling the
evil SPECTRE (Special Executor for
Counterintelligence, Terrorism,
Revenge and Extortion) and‘ bond
dallying with the two leading ladies.

The film begins with_¢Bond trying
to get his aging ”licensed to kill” body

back into shape. In the meantime, I

‘ SPECTRE has

tapped " into U.S.
Defense to hijack two American
cruise missiles. SPECTRE, headed by
long-time Bond enemy Ernst Stavro
Blofeld (Max Von Sydow), then holds
the world for ransom and Bond is
summoned to save the world. The
road to disengage SPECTRE is a long
one (the film is 130 minutes in
length). . '

Connery, of course, is the deserved
star of Never, but he's backedby a
number of competent supporters.
Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera) is a
delightful villainess as she sadistically
blows away her assignrnentswith a
giggle. She especially takes pleasure
when Bond, with a gun to his head,

admits Fatima is the best lover he's
ever had. ’ '
Largo (acclaimed Austrian actor
Klaus Maria Brandauer) is a realistic
/villain whose evil nature comes out
 with such comments as ”I will slice

your throat if you leave me” (which ,

was said to his naive girlfriend,
Domino, after placing the soon-to
mean—something Tears of Allah
chain around her neck).

Come-dill

By MARK MARTINI

Dudley Moore and Mary Steen-
burgen had better start looking for
some new types of “roles. In Romantic
Comedy, Moore is almost too comfor-
table with the role of comedy play-
wright whose personality is Arthur,
only he doesn't drink quite as much.
Steenburgen’s mousiness is starting
to wear a little thin, too. What barely
saves this film, however, is the com-
bination of the two stars, alongwith a
nice performance by Frances Stern-
hagen as Moore's agent.

The premise the film uses to bring

the two together is that Moore has i

just lost his collaborator after a string
of hit plays followed by a flop. Steen-

  

burgen is a Vermont schoolteacher
whom Moore's agent picks to be the
new collaborator. They meet and
immediately fall in love. The only

.drawback is that they meet on

Moore's wedding day. The pair's col-
laboration sets up another string of
Broadway hits, some great lines and
some very funny scenes.

The problems with Romantic Comedy
are an’ over-used theme (love trian-
gles), disappointingly lukewarm per-
formances by Janet Eilber and Ron
Leibman as Moore and Steenbur-
gen’s spouses, too-familiar roles for
the two stars and a stock ending.

”Only two things can screw up
their relationship.” is the bold-print
claim at the top of Romantic Comedy’s
newspaper ad. What the ad doesn't
say is that Moore and Steenburgen’s
funny performances, along with
some funny twists to old plots are the
only things that redeem this movie.

Pitt, defending Big East vol-
leyball champion and winner of
five out of six tournaments this
season, was whistling Dixie after
last weekend’s intense battles.
This changed last night, though,
as the Panthers dropped the first
match of their invitational to
Mississippi at the Fitzgerald
Field House. -

“My reaction is that we are an
established team, and they came
here to win,” said Pitt coach
Shelton Collier. “They came
with the intention of knocking
off Pitt, and they achieved their
goal. I’m disappointed; the
team’s disappointed.”

Collier said that his players
were suffering a letdown after a
strong showing at the Purdue
'Classic last weekend.

“I was afraid that my players
would not_ be as motivated as‘
theirs, and it happened,” Collier
said. “There’s not much else to
say.” I

The Panthers seemed to forget
that the Lady Rebels did not

come North to play Pitt — they .
came to win. Pitt took the first
match on cue, l5-l0, butgot
severely stung in the second as
the Rebs took charge l5-5.

Pitt, who seemed to take the
hint that the Rebels would not
lay down and die for the home
team, quickly steamed to a 9-0
lead in the third game. The Lady
Panthers were back on track,
Pitt 15, Ole Miss 4.

The Rebels, cheered on by a
vociferous bench, fought back in
the fourth game-, letting Pitt take
the lead only once. Every now
and then, the Lady Panthers
showed the colors that played
them above l9 teams this ,/sea-
son, as well as some close losses
to highly-ranked teams. Every‘
now and then Pitt does not win
volleyball games, especially
against a team that was looking
to defeat one of the strongest
teams in the East.

I

Pitt lost the fourth game to the
visitors, l2—l5. The Panthers
picked themselves off the floor,
looking as if they wished some-
one would wake them from this
bad dream. The Rebels saw the
dragon faltering, and "they were
ecstatic.

Spikers Miss ThePoints

The ﬁfth and deciding game
was highlighted by some of the
longer volleys of the night.
Thumps from passes, the smacks
of well-aimed spikes, few words
and much squeaking of tennis
shoes and skin against the waxed
floor were all heard in Pitt’s last-
ditch effort against the upstart
Rebels, were reveled in the home
team’s disbelief and falterings.

Mississippi forged a 10-1 lead,
as Pitt ﬂoundered in the current,
swamped by sturdy blocks and
an unyielding defense. The Pan-
thers pulled together and
rebounded with 7 unanswered
points. The audience game a vis-
ible sigh. Pitt twice fought to
within three, 7-10 and 10-13, but
the desperation was plain to see.

The.Rebels pulled it off, l5-l0,
to upset Pitt in five games and
nearly two hours. While the
Lady Panthers trooped silently
off to the locker room, the Lady
-Rebels were standing around F
gabbing, trying to decide

between tacos and pizza.

After devouring Pitt’s Pan-
thers on theirown court, one is
left wondering how the Rebs‘
could possible be hungry.

...Pltt May Not Flnd
UofL Pupshover

By MARK A. SINDLER

Taking a gander at what Kentuck-
ians have in something called a foot-
ball team situated on the Louisville
campus, nothing worth mentioning
ever passes for meaningful,tavern
gossip. ‘

But there should be a differentia-
tion noted. On the one pole of the

football is a Cardinal team that, on ‘

the whole, looks‘ the part of Division
XIII talent. Yet, when travelling
across the stitches to the opposite
pole, there can be found a brewing
force.
’ Call it the Dean May Factor.
After six games, Louisville coach
Bob Weber is speaking of this in
season-saver phrases. The Cardi-
nals, 3-3, will play host to Pitt
tomorrow evening at 7 p.m. and
have nearly no one over whom to
rejoice but quarterback Dean May
for keeping a “6” out of that 10s
column. ~'
Bluntly speaking, the Dean Ma
Factor is Louisville’s) offensive
manipulator, his wide receiving
corps obviously playing a definite
part. At this, the start of the Cardi-

, nals’ second half, May’s stats read

1,370 passing yards on 115 of 222
attempts. ~ _

Louisville is so dependent upon
the‘ All-America candidate from
Tampa, Fla., that it has reverted to
gaining ground yardage only 26 per-
cent of the time. - \

Accordingly, the_Panthers stand
ready to face a team that is straight-
forward in predictability. The Cards
only average a little under 80 rushing
yards per contest. I

It makes forecasting the weather
as enjoyable as brushing your teeth
with barbed wire.

“Last year, Louisville beat Okla-
homa State (28-22 in Cardinal Sta-
dium), so we have to guard against
taking them too lightly,” Pittihead
coach Foge Fazio said.

Considering what Pitt has succes-
sively seen against Maryland, West
Virginia and Florida State, easier
said than done. '

“I know it’s been 60 minutes of
football the last three weeks,” Fazio
said. “They’ve ‘been three hard-
fought football games.”

Maybe any thoughts of a letdown
occurring tomorrow night, can be
suppressed by rendering Louisville’s
Air Attack useless.

The last time the Pitt basketball

Almost’ seven months ago to the

Doleman in Traditional Defensive Niche

By CHARLIE O'HARA
_, ,.,..-...:.._.,.

Junior Chris 'Doleman’s debut
onto the Pitt football scene came as
a freshma,n‘inmIr9__§l in anationally
televised gaihi: against South Carol-
ina. He hounded Gamecock quar-
terbacks, forcing four sacks and
deflecting a pass. I

The rest of that freshman year
Doleman created havoc as a starting
defensive end, with his efforts pay-
ing off in a Sugar Bowl victory over
Georgia.

Obviously, Doleman made the
transition from the competition he
faced at York High School and Val-
ley Forge Military Academy to the
major college level without
difficulty.

What has ocurred in the Doleman ‘

career hence?
“Chris is at very integral part of the
Pitt defense,” said defensive coordi-
- nator Bob‘ J unko, “[Since his switch
to dropping defensive end] he has
improved every week. He's practic-
ing better and better. When he
switched to drop end the only thing
he was lacking was experience, and
he’s getting more and more each
week.
“He’s the type of guy who makes
the big plays that win ball games.
When he’s covering on the pass he’s

» an "asset, but. when we bring him

'(blitz_him), that's when he’s most
effective; creating all the bad situa-
tions that he has for opposing
quarterbacks.”
Things-have not always been so
ripe for Doleman, though. During
the early stages of training camp at
Edinboro State University, he was
‘dropped to third team because of
loose ends ‘left untied back at the
-Oakland campus.
“I had to go back [to school] to
register for classes,” he said. “It was
my fault; coach Fazio forewarned us
- plenty of times and I just didn’t take
care of it."

Junior defensive end Chrle Doleman Is a menacing force In the face of opposing teams.

“I have a responsibility to the
team and to the parents,” Pitt head
coach Foge Fazio said. “Chris is
here to get an education.”

After taking care of his academic
business, it was back to camp to put
clamps on his defensive end
position.

Currently he is fifth on the team in
tackles with 42, including four sacks.

The defensive unit has been able
to bring out a few more facets of the
multi-talented 6-6, 22-0-l b.
Doleman. _

season's start was whether Doleman
could maintain consistency. He is
known as a big play man, but the
team now needed the solid player
that the two previous seasons’ teams

were able to do without.

They have received the consis-
tency._Aside from a slight l_eft

 

I

. shoulder separation that he suffered
in the Temple contest, Doleman has
been impressing the coaches with his
noticeable extra effort.

“I think I’m playing better than I
ever have,” he said. “With this team
you always have to keep on your
toes, though; 96 guys trying~for only
22 positions. That will tell you what
it’s like.”

Doleman found out all too soon.

“It was a tough adjustment,” he
said. “But it has helped me a great

deal in reading offenses. It has taken A

a little time but I think I feel comfor-
table now.”

Doleman had plenty of expe-
rience in how not to read a quarter-
back for his first two seasons at Pitt.

“The greatest quarterback that
I’ve ever faced is Dan Marino. You
can’t even see the things he does. We
do a drill every day in practice with
the quarterbacks. [In the pass
defense drill] I only picked him off
once in two years. He’s the best.”

Can Chris Doleman go pro?

“If it comes, it comes,” he said.
“College football is like an apprent-
iceship. If you do well enough, the
chance of making the pros is there.”

And if not?

“I would like to go into the law
program,” the administrative justice
major said. “You put so many hours
in up here, though. That makes it

. very tough. It’s like two full—time

jobs (school and football).”-
The season has resulted in no

I regrets as of yet for Doleman,

though , the disappointing losses
have had their effect.

Tomorrow night is the sixth game
of the season, marking Pitt’s half-
way point. Louisville has, shown
suprising offensive strength in post-
ing its 3-3 record.

Doleman and the rest of the Pitt
defense will be matching up with a
team whose quarterback, Dean
May, is averaging over 230 passing
yards per game, in addition to hav-

Swell For spikers

Fir‘.

By LAURIE KUBLI

Home at last.

From the wilds of West Virginia
to the seething surf in New Jersey,
not to mention the furrowed ﬁelds of
Indiana, the Pitt women’s volleyball

team is finally stopping in to see the"

old homestead.

The folks at the ﬁeldhouse may
wish to see IDs from the spikers,
who haven’t played a home match

 since, oh, the third week in Sep-

tember — four days before autumn
began. A
The volleyball team has been out

on a hunt for victory and prestige the ‘

past four weeks. The West Virginia
Classic, a tri-match at Duquesne,
the Big East Tournament at Seton
Hall and the Purdue Classic in
Indiana have kept the Panthers from
their lair.

Roaming the countryside has its
pitfalls, as well as beneﬁts.

“We've spent 36 hours in a van the

,5-g_past two weeks, which tends to take

../



something out of a team. We under-

stand that that’s the gnlypway we're

  

going to play nationally-ranked,
feams,’-’ Pitt coach Shelton Collier ’

said, “so I guess we consider it a
pleasure.”

Last night, Pitt hosted Mississippi
to begin the Pitt Invitational this
weekend. The ‘Lady Panthers will
meet Rhode Island tonight at 7 p.m.,
Hofstra tomorrow at 10 a.m. and
finally, North Carolina State Satur-
day night at 7 p.m. '

Collier believes the tournament
has double significance.

“I think it’s important for us to
re-establish our winning ways. We
need to win every match and the
tournament.

“We need to play well for two rea-

sons,” Collier said. “First, we need’

to improve our NCAA seeding and
second, we need to improve in a lot
of areas to prepare for the NCAAS.”

If the spikers win this tournament, V

it will be their sixth in seven attempts
this season. —

Pitt’s status in the hierarchy of
Eastern volleyball will be on the line
tonight. According to Collier,

sess a desire, perhaps akin to the
motivation that drove the Pitt squad
last weekend, against nationally-
ranked teams. These two teams
would like nothing better than to
dethrone Pitt.

“They are two of the fastest-
developing teams in the East,” said
Collier. “Both programs are very
progressive and are striving for
notoriety. One of their primary
goals will be to knock off Pitt, one of
the top teams in the East.”

“I’m very concerned about both of

our expense,” Collier said. _ “I’m
really hoping my team is up to the
challenge of playing a couple of
teams that are greatly improved and
intent on upsetting us.”

The challenge the spikers face this
weekend is quite different than the
one they faced last weekend at the
Purdue Classic. Pitt travelled west

, Collier admits there is a letdown .
in his players for this invitational.

.“I think there was a definite let-
down, and I have done-‘everything in

a my power to make that letdown_last
the least amount of time possible," "

said Collier. “Anytime you play the

, 5th-, 6th- and 7th-ranked teams in

the country and then play an
unranked team, there is a natural
letdown.” '

Collier went on to point out that
“the motivating factor has to be that
we’re not ranked either, and there's a
reason for that." ,

Pitt’s final opponent this weekend

- is North Carolina State, whom Pitt
defeated last season at North Caro-

lina, in three games.‘The coach said
it was one of the strongest matches
of the season. He is worried that his

. 1 team may not have enough intensity
this year.

“I think the team will remember
the 3-0 match record, but not how
well we had to play to do it,” Collier

v said. “We may take them lightly,

which could spell trouble, but if we
play with the intensity we’re capable
of, I think wc’ll win the match and
the tournament.”

Pitt’s spikers established them-
selves at the top in the east last year,
and have compiled an impressive 19-
5 record this season. Four of those
losses occurred against Top 20
teams, three of which were Top 10.
Pitt has lost only one game on its
home court.

However, the three matches Pitt
dropped last weekend may make it
difficult for the team to get back on
the winning track. '

Said Collier, “I feel that this week-
end is very important for the devel-
opment of ourteam. We need to.

work extremely hard to acquire the_

credentials to‘ get ranked. We're
hoping that this weekend, we can
continue to develop those
credentials."

Pitt is still searching for a spot in
the national rankings, but a win this
weekend will not assure them of that
hallowed spot. In fact, the possibil-

‘ ity is too remote to even consider.

Nonetheless, it is absolutely neces-
sary for the spikers to resume their
winning form and add the tourna-
ment to their list of victories.

Bengal Rebuttal...

Cincinnati Bengals general man-

ager Paul Brown has personally
asked NFL commissioner Pete
‘Rozelle to investigate the injury to
quaterback Ken Anderson in Mon-
day night's game against the
Steelers.

Brown said the face mask and
neck-jerking tackle of Anderson last
Monday night could have been
“another Darryl Stingley case.”

Anderson suffered a bruisedand
strained neck when Pittsburgh def-
ensive end Keith Gary grabbed his
face mask and swung him to the turf.
Anderson's neck was twisted far to

_ ‘the side, and it was initially feared

that he may have been seriously
injured. _ _ .

Anderson had to leave the game
late inthe first quarter.
‘ Brown’s reference was to the
former New England Patriots wide
receiver who was paralyzed five
years ago after a hit by Jack Tatum
of the Raiders.

New Go Of It....
The New York Mets have named

, Dave Johnson as their new man-

_ ager. Johnson, a veteran of 12 major
league seasons with four clubs, suc-
ceeds Frank Howard, who was fired
on the final day of the season. How-
ard will return to the club next sea-

» son as a coach.

Johnson led the Mets’ Tidewater
farm club to the championship of
the Little World Series this season.
. Mets general manager Frank
Cashen said the 39-year-old John-

son signed a two-year-pact. Terms '

of the agreement were not disclosed.
Johnson said his philosophy is not
much‘ different than any other man-
_ager; the two most important areas
to work on are attitude and work
habits. His top priority will be to
find players who can get on base for
George Foster, Keith Hernandez
and Darryl Strawberry.

A Real Ringer....

Fight fans around the world will
have the opportunity to view one of
the most anticipated bouts of all
time when undisputed middleweight
champion “Marvelous” Marvin
Hagler and WBA junior middle-
weight titleholder Roberto Duran
go head to head in a record-breaking
$20 million match on Thursday,
Nov. l0_(9 p.m. EST) at Caesar’s

The fight will be broadcast on
closed circuit television at the Civic

. Arena. Two giant screens, one each

at the north and south ends of the
arena, will_ accommodate up to
16,000 fans.-

Scheduled for 15 rounds, the bout
will be for Hagler’s middleweight
crown. Duran’s title-will not be on
the line.

Hagler is a champion with ‘three
belts —— WBA, WBC and Ring mag-
azine. Over his 32-fight unbeaten
streak, Hagler has successfully
defended his _l 60-lb. title seven times
-— all by knockout.

In his last title defense on May 27,
he stopped top-rated Wilford Scyp-
ion in the fourth round to raise his
career record to 57-2-2, including 48
knockouts. The 29-year-old Brock-
ton, Mag, native has not lost a bout '
in more than seven and a half years.

His opponent, Duran, better
known as “The Hands of Stone,” is

looking to become the first boxer in .

history to win titles in four different
weight divisions. ,

The three-time world champion
captured his most recent crown, the
WBA junior middleweight title, on
June 16 with a devastating eighth
round knockout of previously
unbeaten Davey Moore. Duran thus
became the seventh fighter in boxing

“They have a very good, explo 've
offense,” Doleman said. “May isa
pretty good quarterback and we're
all looking forward to playing him.

“We beat them easily last year [63-
14] but they play good football at
home.”

“They pass the ball well,” Junko

said. “We'll just have to do a good _  .

job on defense of being ' where we

Royalty No More....

A U.S. attorney has filed charges
of attempt to possess cocaine against
two members of the Kansas City
Royals. The players are 1982 Ameri-
can League batting champion Willie
Wilson and Willie Mays Aikens.

During a hearing before a U.S.
magistrate, Wilson pleaded guilty to
the charge, a misdemeanor. The
charge carries a maximum sentence
of one year in jail and a $5000 fine.

Wilson, 28, won his batting title
with a .332 average. He slumped to
.276 this season, with only two HRs
and _33 RBI.

Aikens, also 28, had his best sea-
son in 1983, batting .302 with a
career-high 23 HRS and 72 RBI. He
was the in World Series star for the
Royals in 1980, hitting .400 with
four HRS andidriving in eight runs.

Benched Bird....

It’s back to the bench for John
Lowenstein.

The veteran outfielder had three
hits, including a HR, in Baltimore’s
4-1 victory over the Philadelphia
Phillies Wednesday night.

With the Series knotted a one

game apiece and Game Three sche- -

duled tonight in Philly's Veterans

‘ Stadium, Lowenstein will return to

the bench. Gary Roenicke, the other

half of left field, will enter the lineup..,{;

“I do my job and Gary does his,”

Lowenstein said. “I’m no streak hit- I

ter, but I think Roenicke is.” V

The left ﬁeld combo turned in
strong numbers this season. Lowen-
stein hit .280 with 15 HRS and 60
RBI. Roenicke had 19 HRS, 64 RBI
and a .260 average.

ago, May went to the stratosphere
for 360 yards. Two weeks ago, Vir-
ginia Tech smashed Louisville 31-0,
but May had his propellor at full tilt,
winding up with 269 yards, estab-
lishing school records in comple-
tions (28) and attempts (54):

“Dean is a better passer,” Weber
said, “than a year ago at this time of
the year. But he’s got the potential to
do better. He’s a strong, physical
person."

While May works on improving
that “potential,” the rest ofthe back-
field to which Fazio alluded is not
picking up the four and a half yards
mentioned but works wonders on
third-and-short situations.

Davenport, the tailback, recorded
Louisville’s first 100-yard effort
against Cincinnati on Sept. 24,
cranking out 111 yards on 19 carries.
He leads in rushing yardage with
310, getting 4.2 per carry.

The fullback, Shelby, is no 18-
wheeler, .but he can get you four
yards a carry, as his 32 carries for
124 yards indicate. ,

Contrary to what’s been preached
about no balance, Pitt tight end
coach Carmen Grosso found other-
wise while scouting Louisville’s 42-
14 loss to Miami in the Orange Bowl
last week.

“Everybody that was down there,
about 50-60 kids, played,” Grosso
said. “They got the experience they
need and you want as a coach when
they’re going "back home to play a
Pitt football team. A

spent discussing Journalism Ethics ‘

101. Pressure built, Greenberg
resigned (since joining the Virginia
staff as a graduate assistant under
Terry Holland), Pitt screamed yel-
low press, Bruce Keidan snickered
and, to many people's surprise, Mar-
lon Ferguson became a Panther.
Part of Chipman’s busy work in
these first weeks of practice will be
erasing those events from memory
lest they become distractions. His

real job, however, will be putting,

some ofthe most promising pieces of
a basketball team Pitt has had in
recent years into a working unit. .

The only thing Chipman can be
sure of is that senior Clyde Vaughan,
the Big East's top scorer and a lead-
ing vote getter for the most under-
rated player in the country, will be
the axle‘on which this teams rolls.
The other starting’ positions will
somehow be divided amongst eight
probable candidates.

Included among those eight is a
guard who jumps like a forward .and
likes to play center and a forward
who runs like a guard andmay have
to play center. If Chipman can
decide what to do with the talent of
those two — Darryll Sheperd and
Jeff Robinson —— then his job and
Vaughan’s will get exponentially
easier. ' ‘

Chipman will also have to decide
whether he wants to take the smal-
lest back court this side of eighth
grade and make it smaller. If
Panther fans can remember the way
George Allen can jump, and they
probably can, then they _ should
steady themselves for the debut of
Aiken. The 5-1 1 freshman guard ran
out onto the Keystone Oaks High
School court last April for Round-
ball Classic practice and proceeded
to put on a dunking exhibition that
held the entire gymnasium
speechless. ‘

In between those decisions, the
matter of Andre Williams’ tender
knees and Keith Armstrong’s shoot-
ing touch will have to be addressed.

But opening days, in any sport,
are better left to ﬂashing Polaroids
andhosanas from coaches on high.
If nothing else, the Panthers can be.
called rested, something that could

not be said last. March in New York. ‘

  Pitt May Not See Louisville Pushover  

“They use a lot of trick plays and
almost scored on a trick punt.
They’ll run reverses, halfback
reverses and do some of the stuff
that I used to use as a high school
coach.”

If Grosso were still in the secon-
dary school ranks,’ he might
seriously consider using Louisville’s
defense as part of his own. That’s the
caliber Weber has to work with now.

Only one senior cracks the 11-
man surface, Mike Trainor at line-
backer. Nine starters took a
graduation hike last year, leaving
the Cardinals with less experience
than an infant confronted with a

computer terminal.

This terminal “disease’.’ is made
somewhat more bearable knowing
that Louisville has relinquished
about 25 points per game — dispro-
portio‘nate to the languished
defense.

But should Pitt’s all-around
offensive attack continue at the rate
established against the Florida State
_la_st week (202 yards/ air,
176/ ground), the Panthers should
worry. about nothing except becom-
ing soft at times. Now is the time to
pad those stats and fatten the record
in anticipation of renewed wars with
Notre Dame and Penn State in
upcoming weeks.

“Even though we’re 3-2.” said Bill

Fralic, Pitt's behemoth of an offen-
sive tackle, “I like to think we’re in
better shape than last week when we
were 2-2, even though it. was only
one victory.

“Hopefully we can play like we’re
capable, and if so, then we’ll just
keep rolling.”

The ball will be launched tomor-
row night. Only the Dean May Fac-
tor stands as a detour.
