Jack Wagner introduced his idea of an ideal community last night in the Kurtzman Room.

In comparison
with other cities,
Pittsburgh proves
to be a benchmark

By John Temple
Asst. News Editor

Pittsburgh has more affordable housing and
higher air quality than most United States metro
areas, but it also suffers a higher rate of poverty.

Yesterday, Pitt urban researchers released the
findings of “Pittsburgh Benchmarks,” a report
determining the area’s quality of life as com-
pared to the 50 largest counties and cities in the
United States. Pittsburgh has the 40th largest
population of U.S. cities and Allegheny the 19th
of counties.

Researchers from Pitt’s University Center for
Social and Urban Research spent 10 months
compiling the report.

The indicators selected for the report are
compared with national averages with
Pittsburgh faring better in seine areas than oth-
ers.

“Several of the findings surprised us,” project
director Ralph Bangs said.

The report’s statistics reveal that the
Pittsburgh School District had the highest rev-
enues per pupil in 1990-’91 among the 58
largest public school districts.

Pittsburghs housing was found to be very
affordable compared to most cities.

“Affordability was determined by comparing
average incomes with average rental housing,”
Bangs said. “We also found that there was little
overcrowding.”

Although Pittsburgh’s homicide rate has been
rising since 1988, its rate is still lower than that
of the other cities surveyed.

Negative findings include high rates of death
by cancer and heart disease, a result Bangs
attributed to the large number of older people

Wagner's future community involves youths

By Rachael DeVine
Staff Writer

Jack Wagner told his audi-
ence last night that he will
take Pittsburgh into a future of
less crime, a better economy
and a greater sensitivity of
public school systems if he is
elected mayor of Pittsburgh.

“The prime responsibility of
municipal" government is pub-
lic safety,” Wagner said at last
night’s University Democrat-
sponsored town meeting. “A
whole lot of tax dollars go to
public safety, which makes it
an important issue."

\Y/agner said he believes in
employing 300 more police
officers. When he was grow-
ing up in Pittsburgh there
were beat officers in city
neighborhoods that watched
out for and became a part of
the beats.

Wagner said he wants a
community policing program
for the neighborhoods of the

Delta Tau Delta and Chi
Omega gain Greek Week

points and Cathedral Award

By Matt Groff
Staff‘ Writer

Delta Tau Delta and Chi Omega were named Cathedral
Award winners on Friday at the Greek Week Formal, signify-
ing them as the top fraternity and top sorority on campus,
respectively.

“We have a very strong fraternity,” Delta Tau Delta house
representative Aaron Quiggle said. “We’ve worked together
this year to improve ourselves and community.”

The award is based on points achieved in 11 areas, includ-
ing Greek Week, alumni support, member educationland
sports.

The Greek Week Formal, held at the Sheraton at Station
Square, also featured the presentation of the Greek Week
Award to Delta Tau Delta and Delta Delta Delta for earning
the most points during Greek Week.

“We work hard all year to do well in Greek Week,” Delta
Delta Delta President Amy Doughty said. “All of our mern-
bers participate. We want to be known for our high achiev-
ing and well-rounded membership.”

Delta Delta Delta’s title is its ninth consecutive, while Delta
Tau Delta’s award-winning night caps off a year of local and
national recognition of the fraternity. Earlier this year, the Pitt
chapter was named by the national fraternity as one of the
top two Delta Tau Delta chapters in the country in a field of
150.

“We are glad to be back on top,” Delta Tau Delta member
and Greek Week business manager Brian Rifkin said. “It has
been an outstanding year for us in many ways.”

Following Delta Tau Delta were Phi Gamma Delta and
Sigma Phi Epsilon. For sororities, Alpha Epsilon Phi finished
second and Chi Omega, third.

According to Rifkin, overall the Pitt Greeks raised $93,450
for Pennsylvania Special Olympics and worked more than
16,000 volttnteer hours in doing so.

Sponsors play big

By Matt Groff
Staff’ Writer

As the excitement from Greek
Sing fades and the “suffering”
from the dance marathon
becomes only a blurry memory,
one thing that will remain is the
money raised through the Pitt
Greeks’ work in Greek Week.

In order to get the best results-

in their fund raising this year,
the Pitt Greeks looked to sever-
al people outside the Greek sys-
tem for support throughout the
Greek Week preparation
process.

“Without our sponsors Greek
Week could never work,” Greek
Week business manager Brian
Rifkin said. “Their seed money
gets us off‘ the ground and
makes possible everything we
do.”

According ‘to Rifkin, Greek
Week annually raises" over
$90,000 for its charity. This year
Pennsylvania Special Olympics
was chosen. R

“Greek Week is a great effort
by Pitt,” Pittsburgh city
Councilman Bob O’Connor
said. “It is a shame that Pitt gets
bad publicity about isolated
events when there are thou-
sands of people making positive
contributions in events like
this.”

O’Connor_is active in support-
ing Greek Week along with his
former employer, Pappan’s
Family Restaurants/Roy Rogers.
President Demetrius Pappan
backed the dance marathon and
provided T-shirts and trophies
for other Greek Week events.

Another active supporter of
Greek Week was former Pitt
basketball star Curtis Aiken.

part in fund raising
for Greek Week

Aiken, representing Cameron
Coca-Cola, provided banners
for several of the Greek compe-
titions. .
“Cameron Coca—Cola’s sup-
port has been phenomenal. This
year they specifically supported
the chariot race,” Rifkin said.
The third member of the three
main sponsors was Central
Blood Bank, represented by
senior field representative Dave
Edmunds. The blood bank was
involved in Greek God and
Goddess and the Greek Sing
events. In return, the Pitt Greeks
have supported Central Blood
Bank through periodic Greek
blood drives, which concluded
the week before Greek Week.
“These three firms have been
the foundation of Greek Week’s
success for many years,” Rifkin
said. “From there we have
branched out to find other sup-
porters and build on -that suc-
cess.”
‘ Donald Bayne of Bayne and

Associates is one ‘such support-.

er, donating T-shirts and tro-
phies along with helping the
dance marathon and Greek
Week formal become a reality.

The 5k Run’s high turnout this
year was primarily due to the
sponsorship of Bruegger’s Bagel
Bakery and D.D.F. and M.
Marketing, which has experi-
ence in marathon-type events
through their work with the
Boston Marathon.

In most of the Greek Week
activities, points were at stake
for the high finishers to be tal-
lied for the overall top Greek
Chapters in Greek Week. This
scoring was provided by

Dust control is major concern for par/eers

V

out scientific and
techno? lOgiC21l creativity

Byjulie Holaren
Sta_[7' Writer

Imagination and creativity were
the ingredients used to make the
floats in the Engineers Week
annual parade held last Friday.

The highlight of the week was
the skits that were perfomred at
the end of the parade that poked
fun at the competition.

Each of the seven participating
departments decorated a ﬂat—bed
truck to go along with the game
or TV show chosen as their
theme, and the floats acted as
stages for the skits.

“Everything was organized
great and ran as planned,” Vice
President of the Engineering
Student Council Mark Raymond
said. “Everyone seemed to be
having a blast.”

"Gilligan’s Island” was per-
formed by the mechanical engi-
neers by their versions of the
Skipper, Gilligan, Mr. and Mrs.
Howell. A life—size caricature of a
professor asked to perform but
refused due to stage fright.

The extra effort in having stu-
dents act as waving palm trees
and playing the theme song on
departure won this event.

The skits were taped the night
before on cassette to be played
ove.r a loud speaker to ensure that
the audience could hear. As a
result, the students not only had
to act but lip-sync their roles as
well.

The electrical engineers opted
to do their skit live because
“S:iturday Night Live" was the
theme. Billy Joel was the so—called
celebrity guest who gave a con-
cert mocking the other depart-
ments.

Due to unsafe weather condi-
tions, the Soap Box Derby sched-
uled for Saturday morning was
cancelled.

Saturday night at Per Favore
Restaurant in North Oakland was
where the overall and individual
event winners were announced.

Mechanical engineers won the
Monopoly and Ingenuity touma—
ments. Ingentrity required each
department to make a car out of
an ordinary mouse trap, powered
by the spring.

The winner of the blood drive
was the chemical engineering
department.

A Jeopardy game was held
Wednesday evening, and each
department sent two teams to
compete. Frank Grasha was the
student who stood in for Alex
Trebec and the electrical depart-

» ment proved to be the smartest in

categories ranging from cartoons
to song lyrics to Canadian
provinces.

The winners of “Gimmick,” fun
and embarrassing events such as
three—legged races and egg tosses,
were the industrial engineers.

The overall winner, the material
science department, received its
trophy from last year’s winners,
the chemical engineers. Along
with the trophy they get “brag-
ging rights” of being the strongest
and smartest department for the
upcoming school year.

Each department nominated
one male and female for the titles
of St. Pat and St. Patricia, other-
wise known as King and Queen
of the School of Engineering.
Voting took place all last week,
Jeannette Johnson, a civil engi-
neering major and president‘of
the Engineering Student Council,
was crowned St. Patricia. St. Pat
went to Tom Tomc’/ak, a student
in material science engineering.

“In general, the entire
week was a great success.
People participating had a
lot of fun," said Dorian
Moss, chairperson of Engineers
Week.

Panther Hollow parking lot owners are
concerned about negative reports about
construction on the Schenley Park Bridge
above them.

The Pitt News reported last Wednesday
that dust fallout from the bridge construc—
tion project may damage cars parked in
Panther Hollow below them.

But the owners and County Health
Department officials say that measures
have been taken to control the dust.

"We think it‘s unlikely that any dust will
fall onto Boundary Street," Air Pollution
Control Engineer Marc Itkin said yester-
day. “The work is being done within vir-
tually 100 percent containment. its as
close to airtight as possible."

Itkin said that monitors have been
installed in two places near the bridge to
detect dust in the air.

Owner of the new Panther Hollow
parking lot, Sol Gross said that pa-
trons were concerned about the
story though his lot is not even near the
bridge.

Women's Health Institute will study
disease prevention in women

By Judith A. Friedl
Sta_ﬁ'Wrt’ter

The National Institute of Health
(NIH) has granted the University
of Pittsburgh $10.5 million to
study ways to prevent the occur-
rence of a number of diseases in
women as part of a bold new
Women's Health Initiative (WI-II).

Heart disease is the number
one killer of women, according to
the NIH, and one in eight women
will develop breast cancer at
some point in her life. Despite
these statistics, women were
excluded from medical research
because of researchers’ concerns
that women’s cyclical hormone
changes might affect research
data or that women might

‘become pregnant during a study.

“The Women’s Health Initiative
will be able to answer important
questions regardingvthe preven-
tion of breast and colon cancer,
heart attack, osteoporosis and
spine and hip fractures among
women,” said Lewis Kuller, M.D.,
chairperson of the Pitt depart-
ment of epidemiology and princi-

pal investigator of the Pitt WHI
Pf0i€C£

“It will also provide the largest
data base ever collected among
women that will be able to help
researchers evaluate the causes of
cancer, heart disease, diabetes
and stroke,” Kuller said.

Pitfs Graduate School of Public
Health (GSPH), the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute and Magee-
Wornen’s Hospital will team up
to form one of only 16 Vanguard
centers in the country to take part
in the 15-year, $625 million pro-
gram.

Pitt will be one of only three
WI-II sites to study bone mineral
density because the university has
performed previous research in
osteoporosis.

Pitthas the most modem tech-
nology available for measuring
bone density, Kuller said.

“We are uniquely qualified to
investigate several avenues con-
cerning osteoporosis, including
the effect of hormone replace-
ment therapy and the use of calci-
um and vitamin D supplements
as preventative measures,” he

said.

During the next three years, the
Pitt research group will recruit
1,270 post—menopausal women,
ages 50-79, for a clinical study of
dietary and hormonal disease
interventions. These women will
receive educational programs on
lifestyle change and improve-
ment

Another 2,200 women will be
recruited as a control group and
will be observed only. About
160,000 women will be recruited
for the Initiative across the coun-
try.

Janet Bonk of the department
of epidemiology, recruiter for the
Pitt study, said recruiting will
begin in the fall of 1993. Bonk
will use mailings, the media and
individual approaches to contact
women for WI-II.

“College women should tell
their mothers and grandmothers,”
Bonk said “We want to get the
infomration out.”

Women interested in taking
part in the Initiative can call the
department of epidemiology at
624-4290.

Vintage Parks: taking
a stand for students
as Well as for himself

By Pete Oppelt
Staff Writer

Imagine the University of Pittsburgh’s astonishment when it
offered to pay Steve Parks’ tuition and he politely said, “No
thanks.”

As the Graduate and Professional Student Association presi-
dent, Parks is entitled to free tuition (and a free parking space,
which he also declined), but his gripe was that half of the
money would come from Student Activity fees.

Parks said he thought that the money would be better spent
elsewhere and that “if they pay me, they should pay all 14
[graduate] student representatives.”

After several exchanges, the administration reluctantly let
him use the money to hire student advocates, which he said
has paid off immensely. This semester they have been success-
ful in getting book scholarships and free legal advice for grad-
uate students. I

The episode was vintage Parks — fighting the establishment
for beneficial gains, all within a swirl of controversy. But for
the 29-year-old grad student, ideas for change are carefully
considered and never without purpose.

Take, for example, his reasoning for being GPSA president
in the first place. Not long ago, Parks’ wife, grad student Lori
Schorr, led a coalition for child care at Pitt, with ,which he
assisted. The couple worked on the project once they had
found no daytime care at Pitt for their own children, Sadie, 3,
and Eliot, 5.

“We needed access to committees and IPitt Chancellor _].
Dennis] O’Connor. We knew grad students didn’t have an
effective government,” he said.

So Parks ran for president, making himself eligible by attend-
ing one GPSA meeting prior to the election.

He won the post “with hardly any votes” over a longtime
GPSA official and the day after faced charges from the Student
Activities Office that he stole the election. He weathered the
accusations and is now in his second term and running unop-
posed for his third.

Again amid controversy, “Parks got what he wanted, and with 7

positive consequences. A few months later the childcare coali-
tion, led strongly by Schorr, persuaded Pitt to spend a million
dollars to institute a daycare program for students with chil-
dren.

It is this willingness to effect change and help other people
that motivated Parks to earn undergraduate degrees in philoso-
phy and English and, in grad school, to focus on critical and
cultural studies in the English department. His desire is to
teach literacy courses like general writing.

Parks knew he always wanted to teach but saidhis self-pro-__

claimed mentors “and fellow ‘teaclring assistants Chris Ross and
Donna Dunbar-Odom made him realize how worthwhile the
field is.

“They both taught me to see how important teaching is and
its practical effects in supplying skills to fundamentally change
lives,” he said. I

Away from teaching, Parks credits his inspiration to his wife ‘

of five years, Lori, a film studies major. They met in a psycho-
analytic literature course.

Parks says he admires his wife’_s activeness since, “She’s
doing the same thing I’m doing but with the baggage of moth-
erhood.”

If so, Schorr is a very busy woman.

In addition to his GPSA position, which requires “a fair .

amount of hours,” he works the midnight to 8 a.m. shift in the
Allegheny County Probationoffice and teaches one or two
classes a semester.

It was his wife’s childcare coalition, for which she won a stu-
dent leadership award, that he calls “a model organi/.ation for
how grad students could use their degrees and get something
done” — and he uses her formula to get results for the
GPSA.

Parks cites launching the Pan-African Graduate and
Professional Associations as one of his proudest accomplish-
ments. He and his staff have also vehemently lobbied against
the S30 safety/shuttle bus fee that is to be imposed in the fall.

Parks was mentioned in the Feb. 8 edition of the New
Republic after speaking at a writing forum. He was speaking
about whether it is the fault of students that they have trouble
writing or a flaw in the teachers’ approaches.

Parks said that teaching methods should be reformed and
quoted revolutionary Stokely Carmichael to emphasize his
point. The New Republic writer blasted Parks’ Carmichael anal-
ogy as “absurd" and even called Parks’ argument “dangerous.”

The GPSA president said he enjoyed his brush with fame and

was in his element — being caring and controversial. Vintage

"That is not a tough issue.

Pittshurgh area are rooted in
convention and tourism.

"\\"e are Son miles avvay
from (it) percent of the pop-
ulation in North America, we
have the most modern air-

is no reason that we cannot

he said.

Wagner‘ focused on state
government as an aim for
htiilding a convention town.

“\\"e need to get state gov-
ernment to do for Pittsburgh
what it has done for
Philadelphia." \‘<'agner said.

Philadelphia received $183
million to htiild a new con-
vention center while
Pittshurgh has had trouble
getting 88 million for the
reconstruction of an old
convention center, and
Wagner said that Pittsburgh
can no longer be denied this

way.

"Harrishtirg is going to

said.

Pitt students Erin Bush and

Yeltsinmania

The Russian author Dostoievsky once wrote in his classic novel
Crime and Punishment that “in beggary, a man is not driven forth
from human society with a cudgel, but, to make his condition more
humiliating is swept away with a broom 

Today, as news of a $1.6 billion dollar aid package for Russia hits
the streets, it also seems that Russian President Boris Yeltsin is
receiving help from President Clinton. The package includes money
for food and grain, medical supplies, oil pipelines and U.S.—SoViet
joint ventures. It is a decent gesture on the part of Clinton and will
do much to establish his foreign policy credentials — both home
and abroad. But while it may help to paint President Clinton in a
presidential light, in reality it will do little to assure the long-term
stability of America’s former enemy; it may just sweep Yeltsin away
yet.

To ensure the well-being of Russia, Clinton should have acted
with a coherent policy — not just aid. Aid will_not encourage the
long—terrn investment of foreign firms; aid will not transfer technolo-
gy to the embattled country; aid will not open Western markets to
Russian goods; and most importantly aid will not undenninethe
foundation of the political elites and their practices.

In short, President Clinton squandered an opportunity to assert
himself on the world stage. Rather than acting with a definitive poli-
cy he offered money and words: “We know where we stand. We
stand with Russia. We are with Russian reforms. We are with
Russian markets. We support freedom of conscience of speech and
religion. We support respect for ethnic minorities 

But support for Russia does not just mean aid to Yeltsin, it also
means tangible backing for the other countries of the former Soviet
Union. Thus far, the former states of the Soviet Union have gone
their separate ways and pursued different interests. As a result, for-
mer Communists have been able to regain power in Lithuania and
other states. If the West is not careful, the same thing could very
well happen in Russia.

There is no denying the importance of aid to Russia. Such mea-
sures, if used properly, will undoubtedly help Russia in its struggle
to survive. But aid is a short-term solution and does little to insure
the long-term stability of this nation. When the $1.6 billion runs out,
Yeltsin will once again go around with his silver cup and ask the
West for help. They will oblige.,And the story will continue.

Baseball needs minorities

The baseball season officially began yesterday all around the
United States, and it was special in many different ways.

The expansion teams started their histories — the Marlins getting
their first victory, the Rockies getting their first loss. But in Baltimore
it was a little different and not because the ﬁrst democratic president
in 12 years threw out the ﬁrst ball.

In Baltimore, the Reverend Jesse ]ackson’s sport commission pick-
eted the game between the Orioles and the Texas Rangers to protest
Major League baseball’s record on minority hirings and the comrnis-
sion’s disappointment with baseball’s minority initiative plan,
announced last Monday.

Both groups agree that there is a lack _of minority participation at
the higher levels of baseball. Only recently has the numberlof
minority managers come up to a respectable level.

Baseball management’s plan is definitely too vague. It sets noth-
ing but general goals and no timelines. For example, the first point
was “include minority candidates for jobs throughout their organiza-
tions ‘within a reasonable time frame.”

jackson’s commission’s plan is much more specific and time-ori-

‘ented. Baseball doesn’t need to adopt all of the 10 points of

Jackson’s plan, but it definitely needs to incorporate some of them,
especially some of the specifics, because generalities generally lead
to nothing.

Science and animal rights
Researchers follow guidelines when conducting tests

Recently, the work of
researchers at the University
of Pittsburgh was attacked by
an animal rights organization
whose stated goal is to put an
end to all animal research.
The organization’s statements
to the press and materials the
group distributed contained
many misunderstandings, mis-
information and inaccuracies.
As a graduate student and
member of the scientific com-
munity, I feel it is necessary to
make it clear that concern for
animals does exist not only
among researchers at the
University of Pittsburgh but
among biomedical researchers
at colleges and universities
nationwide.

One might reasonably ask
what safeguards exist to
ensure the welfare of animals
used in research. In general,
these safeguards exist at mul-
tiple levels. First, all
researchers are required to
receive training that ranges
from animal care and handling
to sterile surgical techniques.
This training is provided on an
ongoing basis by senior
researchers, experienced tech-
nicians and an animal care
staff and is overseen by a
departmental animal care
committee. In addition, more
formal training is provided
through courses taught by
university veterinarians.

Before beginning a study,
researchers wishing to pursue
a particular line of investiga-
tion must submit a detailed

experimental protocol to the
Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. IACUC is an
on-site committee consisting
of veterinarians, researchers
and at least one person not

affiliated with the university or‘

involved in research. Research

can proceed only after a pro-

tocol is approved by the
IACUC.

Most animal care guidelines
come from the U.S. Animal

Kath
Curtis

Welfare Act, which recognizes
that “the use of animals is
instrumental in certain
research and education for
advancing knowledge of cures
and treatment for diseases.”
The AWA, which is enforced
by the 1.1.8. Department of
Agriculture, promotes animal
welfare by regulating the
“transportation, purchase,
sale, housing, care, handling
and treatment of animals.” To
ensure these regulations are
met, the USDA conducts ran-
dom site visits to research
facilities to monitor the health
and care of animals.
Compliance with the AWA is
required of all institutions that
receive federal funds. For
example, research funded by
the National Institute of
Health, the largest source of
funding for biomedical
research in the United States,
must meet all AWA require-

ments for animal welfare.

Another indication of Pitts
commitment to proper animal
care is accreditation by
American Association for
Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care. AAALAC is a pri-
vate inspection organi7.ation
to which many universities
voluntarily subscribe.
Guidelines for animal care set
forth by AAALAC are even
more stringent than the feder-
al standards of the AWA.

Finally, the goal of all
research is to expand knowl-
edge, and this knowledge is
shared through publication in
specialized journals. Before
publishing a study, most
respected journals require
assurances that it was con-
ducted. in compliance with
their own standards for ethical
and humane treatment.

It is clear that safeguards to
ensure the welfare of animals
exist at all levels, including
the individual researcher, the
scientific community and the
government.

The current balance of indi-
vidual and professional com-
mitment and government reg-
ulation satisfies any concern
for the welfare of animals
while assuring continued bio-
medical advances through
research.

After holding the potent St.
John’s offense to just seven hits
and two total runs in Sunday’s
doubleheader, the Pitt baseball
team could not produce another
miracle against the Redmen yes-
terday afternoon.

Panther pitchers were banged
around for 17 hits in the 10-1
final at Trees Field to conclude
the three—game series.

“We just wanted to come in,
play the best we can and get a
good pitching performance,
which is what [starter] Mike
lKressl gave us,” St. John’s head
coach John Russo said. “The
kids got a little upset that they
got beat twice yesterday. Today,
we were more aggressive —
yesterday we were a little tenta-
tive with the bat. Maybe [the Pitt
pitchers] didn’t hit their spots,
but we swung at better pitches
today.”

While the Redmen bats were
thundering out hit after hit, St.
John’s Kress stagnated the
Panther attack, allowing only
seven hits and keeping a shutout
until the bottom of the ninth,
when pinch hitter Ken Strish
lined a fastball over the left—field
wall to ruin what would have
been Kress’ first shutout of his
four—year career.

“I threw a fastball and he got a
good piece of it,” he said. “I tip

my cap to him.”

Unlike the home run, which
would be the only sign of life in
an otherwise cadaverous
Panther offense, the Redmen
found no problems with rolling
over Pitt pitching.

St. John’s second baseman
Nick Cosmo led the Redmen
with a four-for-five performance,
including a solo blast to left cen-
[€12

Redmen catcher Kevin
Murphy and center fielder Jason
Loscalzo, who each went 3-5,
also paced the St. John’s attack.

The Redmen wasted no time
in getting on the board, scoring
their first run in the top of the
first. With a man on third, desig-
nated hitter Brett Bartkewicz
nudged a dribbler down the
third base line, scoring Murphy
to make it 1-0.

“They got some momentum
early and we couldn’t stop
them,” Pitt head coach Mark
Jackson said. “They got a run in
the first inning — the first time
they led in the series — and it
just relaxed them and settled
them down.”

St. John’s blew it wide open in
the second, with four runs on
five hits after two outs. Murphy
highlighted the inning with a
two-run double to left center. He
would eventually score on a
controversial balk.

Panther starter Brian Shaffer

It was a busy weekend for
the Pitt men’s track team. The
squad traveled to the Colonial
Relays at William and Mary on
Friday and then the sprinters
and hurdlers went to the
Gatorade Meet at the
University of Miami on
Saturday.

Scott Bailey placed sixth in
the javelin with a throw of 192
feet 10 inches, which qualiﬁed
him for the Eastern
Championships (IC4As).

“That was his best throw
ever,” Pitt head coach John
Vasvaty said. “It’s a nice way to
open up the season.”

The distance medley relay
team of Mike Umbleby, Wayne
Smith, Devvon Bradley and
Frank Nesko, finished third
with a time of nine minutes
58.2 seconds behind Bradley
and Nesko, who ran their best
times.

The shuttle hurdle relay team
continued its dominance at the
Colonial Relays as it won for
the second consecutive year
andfortheﬁfthtimeinthepast
nine years. The team was
made up of Jonathan Dixon,

more spots in IC4As

Jay Murphy, Wes Alexander

and Brian Whitley.
After the meet, Dixon,
Murphy, Alexander and

Whitley traveled to Miami so
they could compete the next
day.

Whitley qualified for IC4As
in both the 100 meter and 200
meter, sprinting to a time of
10.87 seconds in the 100 meter
and 21.68 seconds in the 200
meter.

Murphy improved on his
time since his last race and fm—
ished with a time of 14.54 sec-
onds in the 110-meter hurdles.

“I was satisfied with the time,
but I know I can run better,”
Mtuphy said.

Alexander exploded on the
scene as he won the 400 inter-
mediate hurdles with a time of
52.96 seconds.

“I was really relaxed because
I already qualiﬁed for IC4As,
there was no real pressure. It
just felt really good,” Alexander
said.

“That was a very good race
for Wes, especially this any in
the year,” Vasvaiy said.

Panther women’s trade
runs strong in Miami

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

All eight athletes from the Pitt
women’s track team who trav-
elled to the Miami Gatorade
Classic this weekend finished
near the top of their events
against a field including the
most successful teams in the
East.

Even though it was a non-
scoring meet, Panther track
Coach Steve Lewis said he was
sure of Pitt’s impact.

“We placed very well against
good teams from Florida,
Villanova and Boston College,”
Lewis said. “Each competitor
from Pitt finished between first
and fifth in their event.”

Leading the way for Pitt was
the 4 x 400 relay team (Tanya
Mullins, Monica Hockaday,
Ronise Crumpler, Kim Blair),
which finished first and was
one of many Pitt qualifiers for
the Eastern Collegiate Athletic
Championships to be held next
month. The 84 x 100 relay team
(Mullins, Allison Williams,
Blair, Crumpler) took fourth
place in addition to an ECAC
berth.

“Even though our relay teams
have been running well to this
point, we are still switching
lineups,” Lewis said. “We are

focusing on being competitive
at the national level.”

Individually, Williams is
looking to compete at the
national level next month at the
NCAA divisional meet as a
result of her NCAA—qualifying
finish in the 100-meter hurdles.
Williams and teammate Staci
Suggs took second and fourth
place respectively.

According to Lewis, he was
pleased with Williams’ steady
improvement but thought that
Hockaday, Tonia Malloy and
Katina Miles stepped up at
Miami and turned in their best
performances.

Malloy and Hockaday fin-
ished second and third respec-
tively in the 800—meter run and
both earned a trip to the
ECACS.

“Both of them responded to
the level of competition and
ran very well in the 800-meter,”
Lewis said

Katina Miles had to respond
to the absence of Najuma
Fletcher, a major factor in Pitt’s
field events this year who has
not been practicing due to sick-
ness. Miles finished fifth in the
high jump and javelin events in
addition to qualifying for
ECACs in the 400-meter hur-
dles.

Blunder

turns title
over to
Carolina

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

The CBS camera cap-
tured the situation
beautifully.

As Michigan forward
Chris Webber’s cold

eyes and icy stare filled’

the screen, the camera
faded into a tense
Donald Williams as the
North Carolina guard
stood alone at the free-
throw line for a chance
to give Dean Smith and
the North Carolina
Tarheels their first
national championship
since 1982.

The camera carefully
pulled away, revealing
Williams in his entirety
as he cooly hit both
ends of the penalty,
setting the Carolina
bench into a frenzied

explosion.
With the 77-71 win,
North Carolina, the

country’s number-one
team late in the season,
reached the pinnacle of
the NCAA basketball
tournament and the
mythical national title.

While Williams’ shots
were ones of intense
pressure, it was a mis-
cue by the All-
American Webber that
set the situation up.

With only 11 seconds
left, Webber rebound-
ed the second of
Tarheel Pat Sullivan’s
misses from the line.
Appearing first to trav-
el, a confused Webber
dribbled down to the
far corner of the
Michigan half of the
court and called for a
timeout— when the
Wolverines had none
remaining.

The mistake warrant-
ed a technical foul -
two shots and the ball
for North Carolina —
and, for all intents and
purposes, it ended the
season for Michigan.

“In the heat of the
moment, strange things
happen,” Michigan
head coach Steve
Fischer said. “We’re not
here if it’s not for
Chris.”

Webber’s boner, of
which he was hazy
after the game, was
reminiscent of former
Georgetown Hoya
Freddie Brown’s errant
pass to James Worthy

The long, horrifying ride

from National League East.

champion one out away from
the World Series to a team
with only miniscule hopes of
contending in the pathetic
NL Least is finally coming to
an end  and the damage is
extensive.

First came the heartbreak
of nondescript pinch—hitter
Francisco Cabrera’s moment
in the sun that sent the
Braves on and ended the
Pittsburgh season. Then the
bloodletting began. The
quality players streamed out
of town, with MVP Barry
Bonds and former Cy Young
Award winner Doug Drabek
atop the list.

Spring training brought
new hope with prospects
and fi1l—ins and a still—solid
pitching staff until another
blow came. Zane Smith’s arm
was in such bad shape that
he would have trouble
rolling the ball over home
plate.

Without Smith, the Pirates
have no shot in the NL East.
The staff is full of can’ts.

can’t lay claim to much major
league experience (25
innings at the end of last sea-
son). As for the bullpen, the
list of things closer Stan
Belinda can’t do is too long
for this space.

There is space for the
entire list of position players
the Bucs can count on —
Van Slyke (.524, 14 HR, 89
RBI), Jay Bell (.264, 9, 55)
and catchers Mike LaValliere
(.256) and Don Slaught (a
combined .297, six HR, 66
RBI). That list is way too
short.

Left fielder Al Martin, sec-
ond baseman Carlos Garcia
and first baseman Kevin
Young are all among the best
prospects in baseball, but
they are just that —
prospects. They can’t be
counted on. Veterans Jeff
King (third base) and
Orlando Merced (right field)
have shown themselves to be
very average players. These
are just too many iffy players
for a team to be counting on
to win a division.

Even if some of the kids
come through and despite
the magic of manager Jim
Leyland, the best manager in
baseball, the Bucs are head-
ed for no better than third,
maybe second, if Smith
comes back real soon. '

Panther lacrosse improves,
places second in Shootout

By Jeremy Swarbrick
and Sean Duncan
The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s lacrosse
team put forth its best effort
of the season, thus far, but
came up short against a
tough Virginia Tech squad,
7-4, in the finals of this year’s
Pittsburgh Lacrosse Shootout
yesterday.

The Shootout, held annual-
ly and hosted by both Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon, is in its
third year of existence and
showcases some of the best
competition among club
lacrosse teams in the nation.

Last year, the Panthers
stole away the Shootout
crown with a dramatic 10-9
overtime victory against
SUNY—Buffalo, the team that
many figured would be in
this year’s title game. Buffalo
did not reach the finals
though, losing to eventual
champ Virginia Tech in the
semis.

Pitt fell in the finals to a
we1l—defensed Virginia Tech
club. The Panthers got
behind early and played
catch-up the whole game.
Lead by senior captain Tim

Kenkel — who was named as
the tournament’s most out-
standing defenseman —— Pitt’s
defense played well holding
a high—powered Hokie squad
to only seven goals.

The story of the game was
the stifling defense of
Virginia Tech. Pitt had nine
open shots blocked by the
Virginia Tech goalie, who
was awarded the tournament
MVP afterward. Pitt’s usually
high—powered offense was
held to just four goals.

In the semi—finals, Pitt
avenged an earlier loss by

beating Pittsburgh Lacrosse .

Club, 6-4. The Panthers lost
to the club just a week ago at
Pitt Stadium. A

Pitt’s first game against a
feisty Shippensburg squad
was its toughest game of pre-
liminary rounds but was
behind superior team play by
Pitt handed the Red Raiders a
10-6 loss.

In their second game, the
Panthers breezed past
Messiah College 11-4 in what
Pitt Coach Gary Neft said
was the team’s best game of
the tournament. The
Panthers then proceeded to

Move to Northeast a plus for Pens

Every time you move, there’s
bound to be some good and
bad.

The Penguins will find that
out next year as they play in
what will be known as the
Northeast Division (not the
Adams). Still, the good out-
weighs the bad.

Sure, it’ll take time to get used
to the new neighbors, but
Pittsburgh will be seeing its
new—found friends only two
more times a year than in past
seasons.

And the Penguins won’t be
saying good—bye to the old
neighborhood. They’ll still play
their old Patrick Division pals
four times a year.

The moves Commissioner
Gary Bettman made to realign
the divisions and especially the
change of the playoff fomiat
should signiﬁcantly help the
NHL in the future. The playoff
system, which follows an NBA-
type format, allows the top
eight teams in each conference
to make the playoffs. That
means a scenario like last year
when Hartford made the play-
offs with 65 points while the
Islanders (79 points) and Flyers

(75) didn’t is less likely to hap-
pen.

The importance of the regular
season is also increased. Instead
of competing against the six or
seven teams in its division, a
team will have to compete with
12 or 14 teams in its conference.

And the concern that rivalries

Jim
Clark

will diminish shouldn’t worry
anyone. The Penguins have had
a rivalry the last few years with
the Bruins and they weren’t
even in the same division. The
format of five.games against
division opponents and four
against conference opponents
only opens up more rivalries.
The Pens will grow to hate
teams like Buffalo, Montreal
and Hartford, but that won’t
mean they’ll like the Flyers and
Rangers any more.

And the situation with the
Penguins joining teams like
Montreal, Boston, Buffalo and
Quebec should delight most

hockey fans. Fans of skill hock-
ey will be able to see the likes
of Pat LaFontaine, Alexander
Mogilny, Joe Sakic, Mats
Sundin, Vincent Damphousse
and Adam Oates all the more
while fans in those cities will be
able to watch Mario in action
more times a season.

The Northeast Division will
field some of the best goalies in
the NHL. Patrick Roy, Grant
Fuhr, Ron Hextall, Andy Moog
and Tom Barrasso will be duel-
ing each other five times a year.

And those fans of hard-hitting
hockey should like the smaller
ice surfaces of Boston, Buffalo
and Montreal. The notion of the
Adams Division (uh, I mean
Northeast Division) being less
physical isn’t true. Watch a
Boston/ Hartford or
Quebec/Montreal game some-
time.

So don’t fret over the demise
of the Patrick Division. At least
you won’t have to see the ugly
faces and dirty tactics of Dale
Hunter and Claude Lemieux
seven times a year anymore.

in the league.

The pitching staff lead by
ace Bob Tewksbury (16-5‘,
2.16 ERA) and closer Lee
Smith (43 saves) is solid and
deep. Omar Olivares had a
troubled spring, but rookie
Rene Arocha could take his
spot. They could get a major
boost if Joe Magrane can be
at all productive.

The Montreal Expos have
plenty of very productive
players, but they also have
glaring holes at first base,
third base and catcher. That
is assuming youngster
Wilfredo Cordero continues
what he started last season
(.302 in 45 games).

The only sure thing in the
infield is second baseman
Delino DeShields (.292,
seven HR, 56 RBI, 46 SB).

Aging car collector Jack Clark
and Gregg Colbrunn are can-
didates at first, while rookies
Sean Berry and Frank Bolick
vie for time at third.

The outfield is the strength
of this team and the best in
the National League. Larry
Walker (.501, 23 HR, 93 RBI,
18 SB) and Marquis Grissom
(.276, 14, 66, 78) have
arrived as top-notch players,
and Moises Alou may be get-
ting there.

The pitching is outstanding
at the top but thin. Dennis
Martinez (16-11, 2.47 ERA)
and Ken Hill (16-9, 2.68) are
outstanding, but the rest of
the staff is unproven. Despite

in 1982, which, ironically,
ensured Dean Smith’s first
title.

Williams shot five for
seven from the three—point
line and notched 25
points, receiving the
Chevrolet Player of the
Game for Carolina. Several
times he drained his
patented Williams three-
pointer— a high-archer off
the dribble in transition.

“As the game went on, I
felt more confident and
my shots kept falling,” he
said of his three—point
shoonng.

Michigan was led by the
undaunted Webber, who
scored 23.

Carolina captured the
lead for good when
Derick Phelps hit a layup
to put them up 68-67.
After a timeout, Lynch
performed a nifty up-and-
under to give the ‘Heels a
three—point lead with 1:18
to go.

With the game apparent-
ly in hand — the Tarheels
sported a three-point, 72-
69 lead and were taking
the ball out with :46
remaining —- Carolina’s
Brian Reece inadvertently
stepped out of bounds on

an inbounds play to ‘
give the ‘ball back to
Michigan.

~Webber put back a Jalen
Rose—missed three-pointer
to cut the lead to one.
After a foul to Sullivan,
who hit the first of two,
the score stood 73-71.

After the error, a deject-
ed Webber stood motion-
less on the sidelines.

The look of dejection

was a change from the
one of fiery intensity in
the first half.

The opening period was
an exchange of spurts,
with Carolina jumping to
a quick 5-0 run before
Michigan’s Jimmy King
sank two free throws to
make it 5-2.

Tarheel center Eric
Montross then fed George
Lynch with a beautiful
alley-oop to make it 9-4 at
15:30.

The Wolverines stormed
back with a stunning 11-0
run against the Tarheels.
Playing in its third finals
in five years, Michigan
stormed to three straight
three-pointers plus a
Webber runner to take the
lead at 15-9.

As if fate dealt a hand in
the evening, a Montross
dunk caught the back of
the rim and bounced away
— only to fall quietly
through the hoop.

The half ended with the
‘Heels up 42-36.

The championship game
was the second in a row
for what has become
known Michigan’s Fab
Five — a group of sopho-
mores who, near the end
of the 1991-’92 season,
became the first group of
all first—year players to
advance to the finals of
the NCAA Tournament.

Now sophomores, the
crew has had to battle
not only opponents but
also several critics, who
griped about their flashy
style of play.

Unfortunately for the
Wolverines, the most basic
of errors cost them a title.

tive hits to start the third. He
left after yielding eight hits
and six earned runs in two
plus innings, running his
earned run average from 5.59
to 9.25.

“Brian had a little difficulty
with his breaking ball. He
hung a couple and they hit
the ball well,” Pitt head
coach Mark Jackson said. “I
don’t think I called the best
game that I could call, so I
definitely take some of the
blame.” .

“The pitches were right
down the middle,” Shaffer
said. “I didn’t throw the ball
where I wanted to.”

While Shaffer struggled
through a short outing, Kress

was brilliant, allowing seven
hits as he picked up the com-
plete game victory.

“I don’t get nervous in
games like this. I’ve done
this before,” Shaffer said of
stopping the sweep.

“If the guys [St. John’sl hit,
the guys hit. It’s my job to
come in and shut down the
opposition. ”

“I was mostly just changing
speeds and sticking to the
fastball, slider and change—up
here and there.”

“IShaffer’s] key is location,”
Russo said. “He’s got to spot
the ball well — if you don’t
hit your spots you’re going to
be clobbered. The key was
to basically to throw strikes
and win the ball game.”

will be back as an outstand-
ing young closer, and Mel
Rojas (1.43 ERA in 68 appear-
ances) was one of the best
and most durable set-up men
in baseball last year.

While the Expos have too
many holes, the New York
Mets have too many ques-
tionable players.

Bret Saberhagen was still
struggling from the injured
finger that ruined a promi-s-
ing season last year. Doc
Gooden can change his num-
ber and his name as much as
he wants, but he can’t get the
magic arm back to what it
was in the mid-’80s. No mat-
ter how great Sid Fernandez’s
stats are, he never seems to
win as many games as he
should. Aging Frank Tanana
and unproven Pete Shourek
fill out a rotation that could
be great or terrible.
Remember, this group
couldn’t hang last year when
it still had David Cone.

John Franco and Anthony
Young are solid closing the
door, while Jeff Innis and
Mike Maddux might be the
quality middle relievers, this
team has been lacking.

Stop in Holland Hall South, Ground Floor.

Tony Fernandez (.275) was
a great pickup and finally
stabilizes the eternally shaky
shortstop spot for the Mets.
Eddie Murray is still a great
run producer and Howard
Johnson brings his 30/30
ability and lousy glove back
to third.

If Johnson, Bobby Bonilla
and Vince Coleman put up
the prodigious numbers they
are capable of, the Mets
could win the division, but
counting on Coleman is like
as re-assuring as managing
the Yankees with George
Steinbrenner around. Bonilla
has yet to show he can hold
up under the pressure of
New York.

In addition to those come-
backs, they are also counting
on youngsters Jeff Kent and
Ryan Thompson. Don’t for-
get, this is a team that goes
in knowing it won’t get any
production from its catclit l\'..

Another team with the pop
to win it but a lot of shaky
spots is the Philadelphia
Phillies. The lineup of
Darren Daulton (.270, 27 HR,
109_ RBI), John Kruk (.323,
10, 70 despite the tonnage),
Dave Hollins (.270, 27, 93)

The Undergraduate Economics Society
in Conjunction with the Department of Economics

presents
A Symposium on the Economics Major
1 TIME: 5:30 P.M.

DATE: APRIL 7, 1993
PLACE: 4P56 FORBES QUAD.

At this gathering you will have an opportunity to

learn more about economics as a major by speaking
informally with several faculty members and

and Len Dykstra (.301, 30 SB)
could be devastating if Wes
Chamberlain and Mickey
Morandini come through.
Without them, the Phillies
are shaky in the outfield, sec-
ond base and shortstop.

The pitching can finally be
good, if healthy. While Curt
Shilling was outstanding last
year (14-11, 2.35 ERA) and
Terry Mulholland is a rock
(.13-11, 3.81), the rest of the
starters have been plagued
by injuries and inconsistency.
Big right-hander Ben Rivera
showed signs of putting it all
together late in the year.

The biggest problem is the
bull pen. Closer Mitch
Williams is a heart attack
waiting to happen for any
manager, and there is no set-
up man of distinction.

The things the Chicago
Cubs have of distinction are
salaries. l’.\<_-ry once in a
while, they just throw money
all over the place and hope it
helps. .

Randy Myers and Dan
Plesac will finally stabilize
the relief corps, but picking
up Jose Guzman is not
enough to make up for the
loss of Greg Macldux in the
rotation. Guzman. and Mike
Morgan are a strong top two,
but the rest of the staff is
shaky.

The lineup still has Ryne

Sandberg (.304, 26 HR, 87 ,

RBI) and Mark Grace (.307,
nine, 64) and some solid
players such as Steve
Buechele and newly added
Candy Malclanado, but it
can’t make up for the loss of

_ Andre Dawson. The team is

also making the mistake of
relying on the chronically
unreliable Sammy Sosa.

At the bottom of it all will
be the Florida Marlins.
There is something really
wrong with a team that has a
shaky lineup and a terrible
rotation to go along with
what might turn out to be the

finest bull pen in the divi- '

sion. When healthy, Bryan
Harvey is devastating, and
right now, he is healthy.
Chris Carpenter and Jim Corsi
are quality set-up men. Too
bad they don’t have any
starters to get to the pen.
Benito Santiago is overrat-
ed and will be more so'sur-
rounded by this bunch. Dave
Magadan is an outstanding
hitter but has no power.
Speaking of power wannabe,
will everybody ‘please shut
up about Orestes Destrade. I
don’t care what he did in
Japan, this guy is not a good
hitter. ,
Outfielder/first baseman

I Jeff Conine, on the other

hand, is a quality prospect
who got buried in the Royal
system and could be this
year's Eric Karros.

Bret Barberie and Walt
Weiss form a solid middle
infield, but this team does
not have enough to get out
of the cellar. Hey, at least
they get to stay in Florida
and they did win their open-
er.

Another ECAC qualifier,

400-meter dash.

“We have far surpassed our
