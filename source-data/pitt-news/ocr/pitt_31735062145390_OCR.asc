Students Will Write April

Cap And Gown Production

Cap-Gown Adviser

Revue Will Have
All-Student Cast

Rome Sets Friday, January 19,
Deadline For Skits

 

By Israel L. Goldberg

This year's Cap and Gown produc-
tion, scheduled for the week of April
16, will be an all-student show.

After years of effort toward a stu-
dent-written affair, the Cap and Gown
committee, meeting with William
Marlatt, director, has decided to make
a revue of skits submitted by under-
graduates.

Ten men who have already sub-
mitted work to the committee have
been requested by Walter J. Rome,
assistant dean of men, to have com-
pleted skits in his oflice by Friday,
January 19, The only limitation upon
the skits is that they be from four to
seven minutes in length, and deal
with some aspect of Pitt life.

“VVe want it understood,” Mr. Rome
said yesterday, “that not only these
ten men, but any others interested,
may hand us their work for considera-
tion. Humor, dancing, and especially,
clever lyrics for topical songs will all
be accep-table features of the short
acts."

According to tentative plans, the
April revue will consist of approxi-
mately ten short skits and blackouts.
The continuous plot of past years will
be eliminated. In its place, tying to-
gether the various acts, will be only
the theme of University life.

William Marlatt, who has directed
“What’s Up?” “The Silver Domino,”
and “All to the Point,” among other
Cap and Gown successes, was in
Pittsburgh last Friday, conferring
with Mr. Rome and the student
writers. He will return to town after
the skits are submitted, and will pre-
pare for rehearsals, which usually be-
gin seven weeks before the inaugural
night,

As usual, only men will take part
in the show. Ballet and chorus num-
bers will feature an all-male person-
nel, as will acts without beneﬁt of
music.

General Assembly
Called For Friday

John Howard, Negro Quartette,
Feature Foster Program

 

 

A general assembly of the Univer-
sity will take place Friday morning,
January 12, at 10:30 o’clock in Memo-
rial hall. All third—hour classes will
be omitted.

The features of the program will be
a speech on Stephen Collins Foster by
John Tasker Howard, greatest living
authority on American music, and a
negro quartette, who will offer several
of Stephen Collins Foster’s songs.
The quartette is being sent here by
Josiah Kirby Lilly, of Indianapolis,
who has erected a shrine to Foster,
known as Foster hall, on the grounds
of his estate. Mr, Lilly, the inceptor
and sponsor of Foster hall is known
as the greatest collector of original
manuscripts, autographs, holograph
letters and a. mass of other material
pertaining to Foster. This material,
which is known as “Fosteriana,” is
lodged in Foster hall,

Mr. Howard, who will be in Pitts-
burgh for the commemoration of Mr.
Foster's birthday, Saturday, January
13, has recently completed a book on
Stephen Collins Foster, “Dear Friends
and Gentle Hearts,” the little phrase
found on a scrap of paper in Mr, Fos-
ter’s pocketbook when he died. The
book is dedicated to Josiah Kirby
Lilly.

Theta Chi, Theta  
Delta Psi Merge
Under National

Initiate Members Of Local Group
Into National Social
Fraternity

 

 

There is one less, social fraternity
on the campus since the merging of
the strong national chapter of Theta
Chi and the strong local chapter of
Theta Delta Psi on December
Negotiations, under way for more
than a year, were ﬁnally completed
two days before the vacation period
with the formal initiation of Theta
Delta Psi members under the Theta
Chi ritual.

General approval and sanction of
the merger was granted by all groups
interested in the move: the members
and alumni of both chapters, the of-
iice of the dean of men, and the Uni-
versity fraternity committee com-
posed of members of the faculty and
of three student representatives.

Theodore VV. Biddle, assistant to
the dean of men, through whose ofiice
many of the details of the merger
were aided, believes that the combi-
nation is a commendable move. “It

SDX Introduces
Illuminated Map
Of Pitt Campus

Cy Hungerford Drawing Done In
Bright Blue, Gold
To Appear

Every little shrub and parking place

on the University campus is immor-,

talized on an illuminated map to be

brought out next Wednesday by Sigma —

Delta Chi, national professional jour-
nalism fraternity.

The map was conceived and drawn
by Cy Hungerford, nationally known
cartoonist of the Post-Gazette. Hun-
gerford is an honorary member of the
fraternity.

The map is the only one of its kind
to be drawn of the University. It has
been done in the school colors, blue
and gold, and is on a gradeof paper
which makes it suitable for framing.
It shows much of the wit and humor
of Hungerford and yet gﬁies a ﬁne
perspective of the campus. Of
especial interest to some students will
be the cartoon of cupid unloosing his
fatal arrow in the direction of an un-
fortunate. And will the Dents like
that picture of the Dental school!

Every year each chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi has a journalistic project
which purposes to help its University
in some way. The local chapter feels
that bringing out this map fulﬁlls a
speciﬁc need.

The map will be sold at a price
which has been reduced to a bare
minimum. An extensive sales staff
has been organized so that the stu-
dent body will have easy access to the
maps. The maps will also be placed
on sale at leading agencies in Oak-
land and in the Downtown Division.

Campus Group Recognizes

Pre-Ministerial Fraternity

Phi Epsilon, a professional frater-
nity on campus for pre-ministerial
students, has been recognized by the
campus fraternity committee. The
organization, which has been func-
tioning on campus for three years as

an unrecognized club for pre-minis-

terial undergraduate students, was

carried through on this motion: “that
Phi Epsilon be recognized as a non-
pre-ministerial
with the understanding
that its program shall not be social
in nature or in conﬂict with any of

social, professional
fraternity,

the social fraternities.”
The officers of the fraternity are:

president, G. Washington Marshﬁeld,
C34; vice president, Alexander Tay-

lor, C35; and Adolph Behrenberg, C35,
secretary-treasurer,.

has the complete approval of this of-
fice,” he declared. “It will mean the
further strengthening of two already
strong existing bodies into a more
eﬂicient campus organization.”

The merger brings together into
one group 28 active members and 28
pledges, There are 16 house men in
the group. The former Theta Delta
Psi house at 151 N. Dithridge street
is the home» of the group,

Theta Chi has 50 chapters through-
out the United States, of which the
group here is the twenty—ﬁfth, or
Alpha Beta chapter. The local chap-
ter of the fraternity was organized in
1909 as Sigma Epsilon, and was
taken into the national group 20 years
later. It has been an active partici-
pant in all University affairs since its
founding.

Theta Delta Psi was founded here
in 1921. Many of its graduates are
now prominent members of the Uni-
versity administration, and through-
out its existence its ,members have
occupied outstanding student oﬂices.
In scholarship last year it ranked
fourth among the 15 fraternities af-
ﬁliated with Interfraternity council.

The oﬂicers for the combined chap-
ter, which will retain the same name
and designation of the Theta. Chi
group, are: George Caldwell, BA34,
president, who has served so far this
year as Theta Chi head; Fred Patrick,
BA35, vice president, who was for-
merly Theta Delta Psi president; J.
Kenneth Atkinson, BA35, and Jack
Brown, C35, who was also a Theta
Delta Psi executive, co-treasurers;
Elmer Hubacher, E34, secretary; and
Joseph Smith, E35, former Theta
Delta Psi house manager, who will re-
tain that office.

The national president of Theta
Chi, Professor George Starr Lasher
of the journalism department of Ohio
university, was here on December 17,
the day previous to the formal merger,
to help arrange for ﬁnal details.

Theta Delta Psi alumni interested
in becoming inducted in the national
group will be initiated at their annual
Founders’ Day banquet in February.
Theta Chi Founders Day is in April.

National Champ
Defeats Madden

Pitt Freshman Eliminated Late
In New York Tournament

 

After advancing to the quarter-ﬁnal
round of the men’s national indoor
tennis tournament in New York City,
December 26-31, Robert Madden, C37,
was eliminated from the running by
the eventual tournament winner.

Madden, seeded as eighth man in
the tourney, swept through all oppo-
sition until he met Frank Parker, de-
fending indoor junior champion and
ranked eighth in the men’s national
singles listings -this year. Parker
came out ahead of Madden in two
sets, 6-2 and 6-3.

The promising freshman tennis
star owns quite a record in addition
to his splendid showing in the New
York tourney, He holds the Harvard
cup singles title, highest award in lo-
cal secondary school tennis circles,
and was also the VVestern Pennsylva-
nia boys’ champion for the year 1933.

Doubtless, Madden will baa candi-
date fcr the Pitt freshman tennis
team in the spring. His elder brother,
Joseph Madden, C36, earned his nu-
merals on the Panther freshman team
last year.

Registration For
Second Semester
Continues Today

2,200 Students Begin Procedure;
Mr. Batchelder Announces
January 17 As Deadline

Registration for the second semes-
ter began Vvednesday morning simul-
taneously with the return of students
from their two-week Christmas vaca-
tion, The ofﬁce of the registrar was
rushed all day Vvednesday and
Thursday to supply study lists to the
hundreds of students in the College,
a.nd the Schools of Engineering,
Mines, and Business Administration,
who officially began their second
semester registration on those days.

Although John G. Quick, registrar,
became sick Monday afternoon and
was conﬁned to his home with a very
bad cold on Wednesday and Thurs-
day, the registration procedure was
carried on under the direction of
Endicott A. Batchelder, assistant reg-
istrar, Mr. Batchelder estimated that
out of 3000 students who could have
begun registration Wednesday and
Thursday 2200 had started the pro-
cedure before last night. Three
hundred of these, he further esti-
mated, had completed their registra-
tion and paid their tuition before
last night.

Today, students in the School of
Education are scheduled to receive
their study lists at the office of the
Registrar, eight hundred students are
eligible to register from this school,

The instruction sheet, issued with
the study list, pointed out that this
early enrollment is not a pre-registra-
tion but that it is the ﬁnal registra-

tion for the second semester_ It also
noted that the “late registration fee”

students qualiﬁed to register in Jan-
uary fail to do so and that reassign-
ment to ﬁrst semester sections can
be assured only in instances of early
registration.

Mr. Batchelder was emphatic in his
statement that all students will be re-
quired to register before January 17,
even if they are not prepared to pay
their tuition at that time_

The entire registration procedure is
being carried out on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of
State hall. The classes regularly’ sched-
uled to meet in room 3, State hall,
were changed for the remainder of
the semester so as to make room for
conferences between students and ad-
visers.

;Expends $300,000
{ In Labor Project

 

Plans Completion Of Exterior,
Installation Of Facilities

By Marjorie Reich

Students returned to classes Wed-
nesday with the whir of machinery
around them as the New Deal set the
wheels of labor turning on the Cathe-
dral of Learning. Under the Civil
Works administration, organized by
President Roosevelt as a measure to
aid recovery by the employment of
men and women in beneﬁcial public
projects, $300,000 is being expended in
labor on the Cathedral. _

One thousand men will be employed
in the Cathedral, although only 500
have thus far been hired. The project
will be unable to employ its full quota
of men until the smaller band of
initial workers has cleared the way for
the complete corps. The retinue of
men includes carpenters, electricians,
plumbers, riggers and other skilled
workers.

The men are engaged at present in
enclosing the lower ﬂoors with the
stone materials which the University
had previously purchased, When this
is completed the entire covering of
the Cathedral will be encased in
stone. The stonework represents
only 40 per cent of the work which
will be done during this peniod, as the
workers will then move inside to in-
stall additional plumbing, electricity,
and steam heat, which will make hot
water in the Cathedral a. reality.

No official word has come that
CWA assistance will extend beyond
the 15th of February, the date origi-
nally set for the closing of the Civil
Works campaign. Congressional en-
actment will determine this date dur-
ing the next few weeks.

John G. Bowman, Chancellor of the
University, said regarding the work
on the Cathedral: “The day is nearer
when Pittsburgh will know what the
Cathedral of Learning means. The
building is not merely steel and stone.
It is an idea, a way of life, the age-
old still small voice suggesting our
noblest selves to ourselves, The
value of such a gift cannot be meas-
ured in money.”

John Weber, business manager and
supervising engineer of the Univer-
sity, in speaking of the construction
work said: “The men employed seem
to be happy in their work. On behalf
of the University I wish to thank
James L. Stuart, Civil Works admin-
istrator of Allegheny county, and the
State Employment bureau for the ex-
cellent cooperation they have given
us in this project.”

Students at the University of Pitts-
burgh are as happy in the construc-
tion of the Cathedral a.s if they had
received a personal gift. The school-
house is going up»!

Finishing the Cathedral

Editor’s Note: The following editorial was
written and set in type yesterday before the ac-
cident occurred to the two workmen engaged in
construction work on the Cathedral of Learning.

Students of the University were greeted with the
welcome rat—tat-tat of riveting machines Wednes-
day as ﬁve hundred workmen continued con-
struction work on the Cathedral under an ar-

rangement between the University and the Civil
VVorks Adminis-
, tration.

  
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
  

In refusing a
 loan from the Na-
; tional Reconstruc-
 tion Finance cor»-
 poration a month
 ago, Chancellor
Bowman received
 much criticism for

issue. Chancellor
Bowman s t a t e cl

. meet an annual in-
terest payment of
a p p r o ximatcly
$90,000 0 n t h e
loan, as a matter
“of good business. Hope began to fade for the re-
sumption of any construction work on the building
until negotiations with CVVA were announced.

Today many skilled workmen are engaged in
the completion of the building. In addition to
supplying jobs for plumbers, bricklayers, engi-
neers, and masons, the project is closing in the
lower floors of the Cathedral.

Chancellor Bowman has again shown his ability
to work in the best interests of the University.
Despite criticism for his stand on the previous is-
sue, the Chancellor continued to work for the com-
pletion of the building, and the increased activity
evident about the structure today indicates his
success.

While we are still on the subject, students should
be warned about the possibilities of injury around
the Cathedral premises. It was reported to the
News Wednesday that a student barely escaped
serious injury in the Cathedral. Falling pipes,
bricks, and other building materials can easily re-
sult in serious accidents for students who let their
curiosity get the best of them and insist on tres-
passing in work—zones. 0

Students are requested to stay clear of the zones
in which accidents might occur. VVhile everybody
is pleased that work has been resumed on the Ca-
thedral, any accidents either to workmen or stu-
dents because of curiosity or carelessness will de-
tract from the pleasure of watching the completion
of the Cathedral.

Student-Written Revue

The University will ﬁnally get a student-written Cap
and Gown .show as plans for a student-written revue rap-
idly take form. Students on the campus and the Pitt
News for years have advocated a student-written show
and until this year these pleas were disregarded largely
because student authors had shown little or no interest
in the show.

Several books were submitted to the committee this
year indicating that students were interested in writing

‘ Hutchins with Eddie Dowling .

a Cap and Gown show. Skits from all the books submit-
ted will be used, in all probability, and the committee re-
quests other students on the campus to contribute books
or skits which they have written.

A preview of the plans for this year’s show indicate
that the most novel presentation in years will be offered
this Spring. Certainly enough interest is being shown
by the graduate and undergraduate Cap and Gown meni-
bers and students alike to make this year's show a suc-
cess.

Students And Politics

The Intercollegiate conference on World Political Is-
sues which opens on the campus next Friday, again gives
an opportunity to Pitt students to express their views on
the world political situation. Coming as it does when
President Roosevelt is announced in the public press
ready to “announce recovery achieved,” and when inter-
nal European disorders came to a climax with the assas-
sination of Premier Duca of Roumania, the time chosen
is an excellent one for the discussion of world political
issues. A

Under the leadership of John P. Bracken and Mar-
guerite Swank, the conference already promises to offer
interesting discussions of Fascism, Com-Inunism, Capital-
ism, and Socialism. Student opinions on these issues,
although tending to mirror the thoughts of professors in
economics and political science, are interesting, and in-
dicate that students on the campus are thinking about
international aﬁairs.

VVhether the United States is drifting toward either
Fascism, Communism, Socialism, or a subliniated state-
capitalism, will furnish material for excellent discussion.
We would also be interested to learn whether college
students themselves have preferences for any of these
forms of government or care not at all.

Starting three. years ago with the Model Political con-
vention, John P. Bracken has consistently headed events
of a similar nature which have awakened in the Pitt stu-
dent body an interest in affairs of politics and economics.
Miss Swank has an.envia.b1e reputation as a member of
the. Womens Debating association and as a student of
political affairs. With such leadership, the conference
should be the best of the series which Bracken started
three years ago.

The Pitt News suspects that Capitalism will be taken
over the coals at the Pitt conference. American college
students who are interested in international politics and
kindred subjects have a tendency to be liberal in their
political and social views. And since these same stu-
dents are those who will participate in the approaching
conference, we can expect a welcome touch of liberalism
in the reports of the various committees.

But whether liberal or staunchly conservative, the con-
ferencashould express nothing but the sincere thoughts
and opinions of students. Ideas gathered from class-
rooms in political science, economics, and sociology long
the pet thoughts of professors, should have little br no
place in the reports of the student delegates, students
should offer their own opinions on the various subjects

be they dyed a radical red or the gold of arch conser-
vatism.

Trolley Rates——A,gain, And Again!

During the Christmas vacation several Pitt students
expressed their opinions on proposed reductions in stu.
dent trolley rates in the columns of a downtown after-
noon paper. The opinions strongly favored the proposed
reductions in student trolley rates and indicated student
interest in the proposed reductions. Additional expres-
sions of student opinion on the matter are requested by
the Pitt News in an attempt to show that Pitt students
are really interested in the proposed reductions.

With the beginning of the second semester registra-
tion, students who plan to return to the University are
thinking seriously of the cost such a venture will de-
mand. Two dollars a week, merely for street-car fares,
is an item to be seriously considered in the budget of a
student expecting to return for the second semester. A
25 per cent reduction on this rate for students coming
from outlying suburbs will be a welcome change in the
ﬁnancial considerations of Pitt students.

The Pitt News STILL claims that trolley-fare reduc-
tions for Pitt students can be effected. Students on the
campus are asked to express their opinions through the
columns of this paper. If students are interested in the
project, the Pitt News will continue its editorial stand
for trolley-fare reductions.

Effluvia

By Saul Weisberg

T HAS LONG BEEN THE HOPE of many liberals and radicals
that the various “youth movements” in the United States would
some day be organized into a single group, large, powerful, and ﬁrm

in a single purpose.

Last week, sponsors of this idea made an at-

tempt to carry out their hopes with the staging in Washington of

the National Conference on Students in Politics.

was attended by delegates from the National Student league, the

League for Industrial Democracy, and¢

the National Student federation, or-
ganizations which were also having
conventions in Vvashington.

The conference was underpublicized
and little information has been given
out about it. However, as I under-
stand it, it was an effort to relate the
activities of the three organizations
whose delegates attended the larger.
convention,

with the ﬁnal aim ofl

more in sympathy with the demands

of the laboring group than they can

possibly feel with the desires of other

college students whose fathers are

wealthy industrialists and manufac-
turers,

URTHERM=O'RE, IT WAS useless

to think that two organizations

of the diverging creeds of the National

Student league and the League for

having an the Student Political groups l Industrial Democracy could meet in

in this country combine wherever pos-
sible in order to achieve some meas-
ures desired by all the organizations
concerned.
C‘-CORDING T0 WHAT was told
to me by Pitt students who at-

tended the conference, the convention
Was a rather miserable failure. In
the ﬁrst place, because of a ruling
concerning conventions taking place-
in the Chamber of Commerce build-
ing, no deﬁnite resolutions of any
policy could be passed, and thus the
conference was hamstrung from the
start, insofar as a possible platform
was concerned. In the second place,
a tremendous amount of squabbling
and quibbling went on among the
three groups attending, no agreement
was possible, and only a few pious
platitudes were issued as product of
the conference’s labor. In the third
place, those either attending the con-
ference or watching it as spectators
received the impression that the three
groups probably would never be able
to coordinate and harmonize their in-
dividual activities and views_

Such a result from such a confer-
ence could have been expected. It is
as idle to suppose that all students
have the same interests as that all
industrialists, laborers, and capital-
ists should favor the same policies.
Men and women in colleges are much
more closely related to the class from
which they originate than to the
groups in universities with which
they have contact. Those students
from City college of New York, who
are sons of clothing workers, feel

Women Present
Colorful Pageant

Student-Written Production To
Replace Former Programs

A colorful pageant depicting women
through their hundred years of uni-
versity life will be given in the ban-
quet room of Memorial hall on Fri-
day, January 19, at 12:30 o’clock,
when the women of the University as-
semble to celebrate Women’s Day.
This day is annually set apart in
commemoration of the coming of
women to the University.

The pageant, written by Lois Milli-
ken, assisted by Maxine Hirsch and
Ruth Eisenberg, is a deviation from
the past custom of having a prominent
woman speaker. The Women’s Coun-
cil of WSGA, which sponsors Wom-
en’s Day, asked.M,rs. Cornelia Brice
Pinchot to speak last year; and in
1932 Madame Sorabji, a prominent
woman lawyer from India, made the
address.

Fannie Hirsch, chairman, announced
the following appointments to com-
mittecs: properties, Selma Ries,
Beatrice Foster, and Margaret Chalm-
ers; publicity, Catherine McGuire and
Carolyn Hall; invitations, Ruth An-
derson; music, Helene Green; and
decorations, Martha Green.

harmony. The Student league is very
radical, its views resembling very
closely those of the -Communist party.
The League for Industrial Democracy
is a liberal organization, believing in
economic evolution, freedom of
speech and press, and all the other
policies to which liberals adhere. Be-
tween two such groups there is sure
to exist a bitter conﬂict, just as a
vicious hatred exists between Com-
munist and Socialist. And as a mat-
ter of fact, the ﬁght between the Stu-
dent League and the LID was a pri-
mary ‘factor in causing the confer-
ence to be so unproductive.

The above is not to say the Confer-
ence was in all its aspects, 3. worth-
less idea. If various student groups
cannot combine into a single unit,
nevertheless there can be some con-
nection between them, especially in
such an activity as the peace move-
ment. Here, all students can work
together without too much friction
and with a saving of great labor and
an intense concentration of energies.
All student movements can also join
without too great a straining of ideals
into a ﬁght to strengthen and put into
actual practice the principle of fac-
ulty and student freedom of ex-
pression, If only such things as these
were attained the combined student
movement would be indeed a proﬁt-
able and worthwhile effort. But the
hope for a single organization ex-
pressing the general opinion of the
great mass of American students——-
such a. hope is a futile one and one
which will probably never be realized.

Helen Bruun Will
Lead Prom With
Ellsworth Miller

‘William Penn Hotel Ballroom Is
Scene Of Annual Formal;
Tickets Sell At $3.50

 

 

Helen Bruun, Ed35, has been chosen
:by H. Ellsworth Miller, chairman of
:the Junior Prom, as his partner to
‘lead the grand march. The prom
..queen is secretary of the YVVCA, ex-

.change editor of the Panther, and a

{member of the hostess committee of
WSGA and the YMCA Inquiry club.

Miller announced that the prom
‘cilhls year will take place in the ball-
{T0011} of the William Penn hotel, and
ythat the affair will last from 9:30 to
:2 o'clock.

The p-rice for the dance this year,
it was announced. is $3.50, the lowest
price in the history of the University
for this dance. Explaining that the
.committee felt it might be more con-
venient for some students, Miller said
reservation tickets would be on sale
;at $1. Reservation tickets may be
exchanged at the door, the night of
the dance, or in the oﬂice of the dean
of men, January 17, 18, and 19, from
9 to 5 o’clock, or at the exchange
booth on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Alumni
hall, from 11 to 2 o’clock, on the same
.dates.

Although the name of the orchestra
has not been revealed, several nation-
ally known orchestras are being con-
tacted, and the results of the negotia-
tions will be announced soon, Miller
stated.

Although far from the number
aimed for by the committee for the

‘ber 15 attended the affair, 193 paying
couples were present, assuring ﬁnan-
cial success for the dance. A ﬁnan-
cial report secured by the News, in-
complete because a number of bills
have not yet been submitted, shows
an app-roximate proﬁt of about $8,

The proﬁt, though low, enabled the
committee to maintain the 1933 dance
tradition—a tradition of keeping all
dances out of the red. Not one major
affair during the last year suffered a
loss.

Al Buhl’s orchestra played for its
second University affair this semester,
again being received favorably by the
guests, The Grotto ballroom on the
Northside was the site.

Only seven tickets were sold at the
door, which was accountable, accord-
ing to the committee, to excessive
rain that Friday evening. These
tickets sold for $2 each, an increase of

Ring In The New

It ’s an odd fact but a true one that the curtain on the old foot-
ball season is rung down on the ﬁrst day of the new year.

Columbia ’s victory over Stanf

0rd in the Rose Bowl game New

7Year’s Day was a ﬁtting climax to a football season marked by an
unprecedented number of upsets and, if it means anything as the
beginning of a new year, presages another season of dope upheavals.

Without detracting in the least from any credit due Columbia,

one of the chief breaks Lou Little’s%

team got was in the weather. His
team did not have to compete under
a blazing 90 degrees sun which has
in the past handicapped Eastern
schools, While the rain doubtless did
handicap the light, fast Columbia
team, the aid it gave them far out-
balanced the harm. The Columbia
players did not wilt in the second
half as have other teams which have
in the past made the trip west.

Then too, the boys from the East
were more accustomed to handling a
wet ball than were the Indians.
Teams in the East must play in all
kinds of weather. Rare is their sea-

son when they do not play at least '

one game in the rain. The California
teams, on the other hand, play almost
all of their games under ideal condi-
tions. When they meet unfavorable
weather conditions they are ﬁgurative-
ly and literally at sea.

For the ﬁrst time in years the
western representative in the Rose
Bowl was forced to play under condi-
tions more unfavorable to it than to
its opponents. For the ﬁrst time in
as many years the eastern team was
given a better than even break in the
weather. The result . . . An eastern‘
victory,

To argue that the All—VVest_ team de-
feated the All-East team this Yea!‘ 15
not to answer the question. A young
man by the name of Sauer, from
Nebraska, who undoubtably knows
something about wet weather, was
the big gun of the western attack.
He did not hail from the sunny shores
of California.

VVe hate to say, “We told you 80,"
but we wrote enthusiastically of Co-
lumliiascliances in the last issue of
the Pitt News, Incidentally this was
before any of the writers in the down-
town papers hopped on the Columbia
bandwagon. _ _

An we’re still glad we picked Cliff
Montgomery on our All-American
team.

Panther Boxers
To Face Temple

 

Coach Orsini Unable To Decide
On Starting Performers

The boxing team will meet the Tem-
ple Owls in the ﬁrst intercollegiate
match of the 1934 season, Saturday,
January 13, in the Stadium.

Although the meet is only_a week
away, Coach Joe Orsini is still unde-
cided about his starting team. The
large squad of evenly matched boxers
is causing the real difficulty in select-
mg the starting team.

In all but three classes the 165, 175,
and heavyweight, which will be han-
dled by Kopp, McCue, and Greene ‘re-
spectively, there is close competition
for the starting assignments.

In the 115—pound division it is an
even bet between Junge, and Cohen.
Either Zeigler or Beers will box in
the 125—pound class in case Brailler‘
fails to make the weight. Konick is;
giving Jimmie Giannatti, 135-pound
veteran of last year’s team plenty of
competition in this division, Speigel
or Nadler are more likely to start in
the 145-pound class than any other
candidate. Captain Jack Schricker is
closely pressed for a starting position
by Niebel in the 155-pound Weight
limit.

Panthers Oppose
Temple Cagers
In League Game

 

Owls’ Strong Team Hopeful
Of Breaking Pitt Jinx
In Stadium Battle

Anxious to chalk up their second
straight win in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate basketball conference, the
Pitt Panthers will be out to take the
measure of the Temple Owls in their
game at the stadium ﬂoor tomorrow
evening.

At this early date, the Golden Cats
are leading the league, a victory over
Georgetown giving them a. clean ‘slate
for the season. Georgetown owns a
victory over Bucknell in addition to
their defeat at the hands of the Carl-
sonmen. The other teams have not
as yet engaged in league competition.
Just what combination Coach Carl-
son will start against the Owls is not
certain. Judging from the ﬁne show-
ing made by his original lineup in the
recent Ohio State encounter, it is
likely that the same ﬁve men who
started the season will take the ﬂoor
tomorrow night. This will have Mc-
Camant and Skip Hughes at the for-
wards, Cribbs at center, and Ochsen-
hirt. and Charley Hughes at the
guards. Roderick, star of the Minne-
sota game, is not far behind in the
battle for a forward berth and should
see plenty of action against Temple.
Coach Jimmy Usilton will bring a
strong aggregration to oppose the
Panthers. The Owls have always
found the Pitt boys a jinx, for no mat-
ter how ﬁne a team they have had it
always bogged down when meeting
the Golden Cats. Such has been the
case during the past ﬁve years and
Usilton’s men are anrious to break
this long spell and likewise earn
their ﬁrst victory in the eastern con-
ference.

That Basketball Team

Some people may think that there is absolutely nothing the matter with
the Panther basketball team, basing their claim on the fact that the Cats-
trollnced IWO high ranking Big Ten teams in one week. Other people, especi-
ally those that infest the upper North Side, regard the Big Ten teams as;
being quite mediocre, and insist that the Big Ten doesn’t go in for basket-‘
ball very enthusiastically.

There are arguments on both sides. First of all, the Panthers
looked pretty ragged, even while defeating Minnesota and ohio state_
Secondly, the Big Ten doesn’t go for basketball in a big way. Oh
no! Only to the extent of about eight or ten thousand cash custom-
ers per game.

The Panthers’ shots from the floor have been quite bad, and a
check of the attempts for ﬁeld goals in the Ohio State game revealed
that the Golden Cats were only able to make good on four occasions
in the ﬁrst half, missing on 21 tries. The second half produced bet-
ter results, with less shooting and more scoring. Fourteen attempts
were made on the basket, six being successful.

The matter of foul shooting has been especially atrocious, and we had?
better pass this matter by the board. One fact does speak Well for the Pan-"
thers however. When the score is either tied, or the Panthers are slightly“
behind, they waste little time in piling in the needed points.

The worst is yet to come, Temple and the Dukes. The nearest predic—-

tion we can aﬁord to make at the present time, is that the Panthers had:
better improve their play or both Temple and the Dukes will easily top them.-

Great Minds At Play

It really happened at the Stadium office one fine afternoon. It
seems that business manager Ollie Stiff was discussing the stadium
“rat” situation. “Mecca got a couple cats,” said Stiff, “and although
they’ll klII rats, they won’t eat them.” “I don't blame them,” snapped
graduate manager Jimmy Hagan, “neither would I.’’

Clipped, Capped, and Crabbed

program, he will be asked to name his idea of the best composite boxer,-
using the Pitt squad as material . . the big build-up for Izzy VVeinst0ck
