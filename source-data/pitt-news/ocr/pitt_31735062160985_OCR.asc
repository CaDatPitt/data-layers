The University of Pittsburgh
and Harvard University are cur-
rently conducting a research
project entitled CHECK to deter-
mine _ the health benefits of
nutrient supplements on blood
pressure.

”We~are still looking for volun-
teers,” said Nancy Reed of the
Pitt Graduate School of Public
Health. Volunteers are asked to
be between the ages of 30 and 54
and should have normal blood
pressure.

According to Reed, these
volunteers, over a two-year peri-
od, will be given daily nutrient
supplements‘ that are probably
deficient in their normal diets, in
order to examine how beneficial
they are in preventing high blood
pressure. ‘ '

”These are vitamins that some

people are already taking,” said.

Reed, ”such as potassium, calci-
um, magnesium and fish oils.”

Volunteers are scheduled to
visit designated testing centers
eight times per year during the
two-year period to have their

blood pressures taken and to

complete questionnaires.

The CHECK study designated
testing centers for the Pittsburgh
area are St. Francis Executive
Health Center, Pitt Graduate
School of Public Health and the
Pitt Applied Research Center.

”Participation is safe, fairly sim-
ple and really may benefit peo-
ple," said Reed.

Pittsburgh is one of 10 cities
participating in the nationwide
CHECK study. _

Reed may be contacted at the

commitment to ethnic concerns
and its concern over the presen-
tation of documents and histori-
cal facts,” said Stephen Zupcic,
one of the exhibition coordina-
tors from Pitt's Office of Urban
and Community Service. ”The in-
tent of the exhibit is to present the
Holocaust as not a purely Jewish
experience,” he said.

According to Zupcic, in addi-
tion to six million Jews, almost
one million Poles and Slavs were
murdered by the Nazis, along
with thousands of homosexual
men and,one—third of the gypsy
population.

Six different lectures are sched-
uled for the exhibition, all of
which are meeting either on the
main floor of FQ or in rooms
1P56 and lK56‘FQ.

The ‘first lecture, ”A Polish
Remembrance of Auschwitz,” is
on Dec. 13 from 2 to 5 p.m. and
is being presented by the Central
Council of Polish Organizations
and the Association of Polish Pri-
ests of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.

On Monday evening at 8 p.m.,
there will be the lecture ”The
Gypsy Slaughter” being given by
Professor Terrence Kaufman,
Department of Anthropology,
University of Pittsburgh.

The next talk will be on Tues-
day, Dec. 15 at 8 p.m., given by
Dr. U. Davis, University of Pitts-
burgh Center for International Af-
fairs, on "Resistance by German
Nationals to the Nazi Regime.”

”Homosexuals at Auschwitz: A

perspective from the Gay Com- _

munity” will be presented by

Richard Korb, Allegheny College, 9

on Thursday evening also at '8.

lssaih Kuperstein, Director of
Education at the U.S. Holocaust

Albert T. Primo, the creator
of the ”Eyewitness News”
concept, spoke at the Gradu-
ate School of Public Health
yesterday as part of Pitt's Third
Century Distinguished Visiting
Lecture series. ~

Primo, a Pittsburgh native, is
a graduate of Pitt's College of
Arts and Sciences. He began
his career in broadcasting at
the Dumont Television Net-
work and then went to
'KDKA-TV.

While reporting for KDKA,
Primo covered Nikita

couraged the ”bantering” that
is now used by most
newscasters. He has been
called the person "who almost
singlehandedly changed the‘
face of broadcast journalism.”

In 1972, Primo was promot-

ABC-TV, and in 1974, he be-
came executive producer of
ABC. He left in 1976 and
formed a television news con-

During his speech, Primo
talked about the many famous

worked with Howard Cosell in

Primo was also asked about

Primo, ’’It has always, been

6 WASHINGTON — President
Reagan and Soviet Leader Mik-
hail S. Gorbachev Tuesday
signed a historic treaty to
eliminate intermediate-range
nuclear ‘missiles and, together,
vowed to work toward a more
ambitious arms control pact dur-
ing their threedays of summitry.

”We can be proud of planting
this sapling which may one day
grow into a mighty tree of
peace,” Gorbachev said at an
elaborate signing ceremony in
the White House East Room that
was televised live in both nations.

”So let us reward ourselves by
getting down tobusiness,” he
said.

Said Reagan: ”For the first time
in history, the language of arms
control was replaced by arms
reduction, in this case the com-
plete elimination of an entire
class of U.S. and Soviet missiles.”

The president added that ”we
can only hope that this history-

V making agreement will not be an

end in itself but a beginning.”
First lady Nancy Reagan and
Raisa Gorbachev looked on from

' the audience as the two leaders

Reagan, Gorbachev sign

signed their names several times
on the leather-bound treaties and
other documents and then shook
hands vigorously and smilingly
handed each other their copies.

A band played “Hail to the the
Chief” as Reagan and Gorbachev
strode side by side down a red
carpet into the East Room.

The ceremony over, the two
men strode out of the room
together.

At one point in his remarks,
Reagan characterized the treaty
with a few words of Russian.
”Trust but verify,” he said in a
reference to the most stringent
provisions to guard against Soviet
cheating. .

Interrupted Gorbachev with a
smile, ”You repeat that at every

meeting.”
The laughter had scarcely died
down when Reagan said, ’’I like

it."

The 4-2 decision by the state's
highest court, handed down late

_ Several hundred million dollars

on the court's instructions.

DECEMBER 7, 1941

THE BAY THE JAPANESE
ATTACKED PEARL HARBOR

Gordon W. Prange with
Donald M. Goldstein and
Katherine V. Dillon

December 7, 7.947 is the culmination of
Gordon Prange's monumental Pearl Har-
bor trilogy, which has been hailed as a
classic work of military history and the
deﬁnitive study _of the day that brought
the United States into World War II.

At Dawn We Slept was a towering
bestseller that explored the days that led
up to December 7, the day that marked
America's greatest military disaster.
Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History ex-
plored the causes and aftermath of the
attack—and" pinned the blame on cer-
tain people involved. December 7, 7.947
is a moment-by-moment, richly detailed
chronological account of the day itself.
Based on Prange's lifelong, impeccable
research as well as on hundreds of inter-
views with ﬁrsthand witnesses on both
sides of the action, December 7, 1.947 is
filled with drama, action, and pathos.

The events of December 7 are re-
lated with the dramatic readability of a
novel. Prange" served in Japan under
General MacArthur after World War II,
andithe book is enriched with hundreds
of extraordinary reminiscences ofloffi-'
clers, both Japanese and American,
whom Prange interviewed in depth im-
mediately after the war, while their
memories of Pearl Harbor were still
razor-sharp. December 2 1941 has the
human dimension only oral‘ history can
provide.

With this major work—the long-
awaited final volume of the deﬁnitive
bestselling trilogy on "the day that will
live in infamy’-'— Prange, Goldstein, and
Dillon have provided us with the ulti-
mate Pearl Harbor story.

The late Gordon W. Prange. ‘Professor
of History at the University of Maryland, _
was former Chief of the Historical Sec-

- tion in Japan under General MacArthur,

and the author of the distinguished best-
sellers At Dawn We Slept, Miracle at
Midway, Target Tokyo, and Pearl Har-
bor: The Verdict of History. Donald M.
Goldstein is Associate Professor of
Public and International Affairs at the

‘University of Pittsburgh. Katherine V.

Dillon is a Chief Warrant Officer, USAF
lRet.l, and lives in Virginia.

_ Force treaty negotiated earlier this year. If the statements of the _

two leaders are to be taken at face value, this treaty is only to
be the beginning of a series of accords limiting most forms of
nuclear weapons and, eventually, even conventional forces.
T Many conservative analysts have predicted that the removal
of Western Europe from the umbrella of nuclear protection cu_r-
rently in place, which is the aim of the treaty, will tip the scale

significantly in favor of the Warsaw Pact forces. P

Another prevalent school of thought is that any agreement
limiting the spread and buildup of nuclear weapons can only
serve as a boon to the objectives of peace.

However, there seems to be another important question here.
While we agree that limiting nuclear weapons by any means
avaliable is a good idea, we have to wonder about the inten-
tions of the two leaders. ' I
' There has been considerable speculation from all fronts that

Gorbachev is merely using the treaty as a method for increas-
_ ing the value of the conventional forces under the command '

of the Soviet Union. Others believe that Gorbachev has a “hid-
den agenda” for the arms talks that includes more.careful ob-
servation of American military forces. I

Much of this speculation is based on a fundamental distrust
of the Soviets, quaintly referred to by Reagan as the ”evil em-
pire.” On the other side, a large number of Soviets are charg-
ing that Reagan is trying to increase the potential value of his

‘I SDI plan by limiting the Soviet nuclear presence in Europe.

All these arguments serve mainly to underscore an impor-
tant and frightening point. Most of the rhetoric surrounding'dis-
cuss_ion of the treaty thus far has concerned itself with the
benefits to both sides. The benefits discussed, however, have
not been those of peace. They have been, for the most part,
related to the abilities of both countries to wage war under the
limitations of the treaty. Which all seems a little strange for two
countries outwardly interested in the pursuit ofpeace.

In a nutshell 

I began to believe in nothing but

books and the wonderful world of
books -— where if people suffered, they

suffered in beautiful language, not in
monosyllables, as we did is Kansas.

vocate)

THE NAKED CITY

Caught between holidays, oh
woe is me. What to write? What

‘to say? Should I move the Earth

with my rhetorical sword? Should
I stand on the sidewalk and pick
my nose, feeling superior "be-
cause everyone else wants to but

- is too uptight to do so? Oh, woe

is me. ,
Well, this week, I'm going to
run some of the neat—o stuff peo-

’ ple have sent to me. Ms. Oreo in

May sent me a letter that may
very well set a new standard in
obscenity, and I loved it. I can't
run it, goodness knows,‘ but smut
can be such a turn—on. Oooh, I'm
all a quiver. ‘

So how was everyb0dy’s
Thanksgiving? You really don't
have to answer, but I thought I'd
be polite and ask.

The following is one heck of a
poem written and sent in to me
by Caroline Huch. I wish I could
run it as it appears in the original,
but these damn 11.6 point
columns are just not wide
enough, so he—e—e—e—e—e—re it is.

[untitled]
Affect me

Giant monoIith/ .
inverted coal mine bulging
skyward:/ harboring a myriad of
queer white eyes, sticky/ white
eyes which lodge in blank faces/
all set above sartorial flashes of
color/
The clear white eyes
translucent and tepid/ run
through
your bu|k/ up and down each
shaft/ circulating on each
level/ like a pale moisture or
lymph/

Affect me?

Mammoth Leviathan (the)/ per-
versely balanced on end:/ your
monstrous stone belly belabors
every morsell secretes to anesthe-
size/ digests in time to a Wagner
opera/

The infrequent cry echoes

dully off/ vertebral planes

of grey stone and mortar:/
help me
no one knows where I am/

Affects me.

Labyrinth honeycomb/
pillars, arches and passages twist-
ed into hardness:/ Chamber after
chamber haunted by drones/
tending the fragile cells, mindless
mated by the queen/ who is sta-
tus quo, the Safe/
And we are the puny unformed
beings/ in the wax ce|ls/ urged
to forget our voices and to/
discard ourtiny wings/

(Written while viewing the
Cathedral of Learning from the
second floor of the Henry Clay
Frick Fine Arts Library, just before
a storm.)

Thank you Ms. Huch. That was
fantastic and I'm sure that I am
not alone‘i‘n‘my identifying with
your tone. Send in more.

A friend and I were gossiping
today, and before he launched
into a particularly scathing little
tidbit, he prefaced by saying,’
”Not to be a Chatty Cathy, but
I thought it was funny. .

USA Today, that cornerstone of
lowest common denominator,
ran something really pitiful last
week. Theyhad a photo of Nan-
cy Reagan and one of Raisa Gor-
bachev, then they listed_ the
achievements of each woman be-
low her picture. In the same
fashion they do when there are
two boxers who are heading into
a big fight. It was sick, and I am
sure that it was read hungrily by
millions. The fate of the world is
at stake, and people are more
concerned with the hair dyes
used by the president's and chair-
man's wives. We live in a dis-
turbed world.

The following is a poem sub-
mitted by The Walrus. I don't
really understand it, so we'll call
it ’’conceptual’’ and ‘run it
anyway. - '

Pitt's chapter of the Society of
Physics Students has received a
plaque from its national chapter

 _ V for excellent work in promoting

the field of physics.

”lt’s because of what they [stu-

dents] did last year,” said Ralph
Kraft, vice president of Pitt's So-
ciety of Physics Students. .

”SPS is just a formal organiza-
tion of physics undergraduates,”
Kraft said. ”We have our weekly
seminars. We invite people to
talk about current [events] in
physics. There's like 500 chapters
in the United States. In some
places it's just a formation, I
mean, they don't do anything.
But here at Pitt we have our semi-
nars and other things that we do.”

’’I guess one of the reasons we

Society of Physics Students is hon

got the plaque is because'we’re
a really active chapter,-” said
Marc Felice, secretary of treasu-

ry for SP5. ”We have a lot more‘

activity than most chapters.”

Kraft said the chapter holds
seminars open to the public ev-
ery week, where guest speakers
discuss phenomena related to
physics. '

’’I'm in charge of arranging

seminars,” said Kraft. ”So it's in-
teresting, because I get to talk
with professors a lot more and to
talk with them about their
research. They talk about physics
and science fiction  we've seen
videos on different topics. ...”

Kraft and Felice said that their
chapter is currently in the early
stages of organizing two projects
for the winter term.

”The main chapter in Washing-
ton gives out awards for things,
and last year we got it for Phys-
ics and Astronomy Awareness
Week,” said Felice.

. The SPS officers plan to further
promote physics through a trip to
a computer center and through a
national television broadcast of
their own Physics Awareness
Program.

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

Appearing on television and
the silver screen and having tried
to sell America Arby’s roast beef
as well as a couple of joints to
Rodney Dangerfield in Easy
Money, comedian Jeff Altman
offered his views of life last night
to a packed William Pitt Assem-
bly Room audience.

Opening with a few arbitrary
shouts and whoops, Altman be-
gan hisschtick with an examina-
-tion of today's evangelical
leaders. Of Oral Roberts, he said,

-”There’s a guy named for the

wrong end.”
’ He reminisced about'his days
of. college at Johns Hopkins

University, remarking on his in-

famy of having the third lowest
SAT score of anyone ever admit-
ted. It was only in his final yea_r

of school that he realized why he

was having problems academi-
cally. ”I had been highlighting
with a black magic marker,” he
said. v

With calculus having gone
completely ‘over his head, he

I dipped into Jack Nicholson and

African and Carribbean dance

Letterman veteran

asked his professor, ”Pardon me
professor, I was just wondering if
you could tell me what the fuck
is going on?” I '

My dad would get so mad. 
He'd use strange metaphors.”
Some of these included, ”I’ll hit
you so hard your kids’|l be born
dizzy” ‘and ”Come over here,
and I'll flip you like a cheese
omelet.”

Women, men and the things

they do are a no-ho|ds—barred op-

portunity for Altman. He said that
while in college, he would de-
ceive young coeds by asking
them into his room to help him
with some tutoring. '
His libido‘ having taken him
over, he commented, ”That door

would close; I'd instantly become -

one of the mountain men from
the movie Deliverance. [Altman
sporting a thick country accent].
All right now, how ’bout you
dropping them pants. Take ’em
right on off. This here river don't
go to there, you done took a
wrong turn.”

Offering insight as to who has ‘~

said, ”Bottom line for you girls:

One of the prerequites of dat-

to a nice place to eat and get her
drunk. Unfortuately, most of the

called ”a professional drinker.”

characterizes Dunham’s work  

By Mary Campbell

Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK — During the
Depression, a young
dancer/choreographer
troduced American audiences to
the primitive dance movements
of the Caribbean.

Today, the magnitude of
Katherine Dunham’s contribution
to dance can be seen in a special
production by the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater.

The 78-year-old Dunham and
Vanoye Aikens, who was her
dance partner from 1943 until
1963, often disagreed as they
worked to recreate 15 of her
dances from the 19305 and '40s
for Ailey.

'”Once I choreograph some-
thing and put it on the stage, I put
it aside and go on to something

else,” said the woman who-

in-

founded America's first, major,
black dance company. ’’If I had
a photographic memory, I don't
think I would create as much as
I do. I've created maybe .150
dances. . —
”Van teaches now in Sweden.
He came back, along with three

. others from my company, to help

recreate these,” she added. Miss
Dunham’s dances were neither
photographed nor ‘written in
dance notation. Ailey hopes to
keep some of them from being
lost forever.

”The Magic of Katherine Dun-
ham” at City Center features such
Afro-Caribbean dances as
”L’Ag’Ya,” a folkloric dance/dra-
ma set in 18th century Marti-
nique. Choreographed in 1937,

the dance combines the storyof .

Romeo and- Juliet and Giselle.
There's also ”Shango,” a 1945

. dance illuminating sacrificial rites '

from Trinidad and Haiti. .

”Most rituals and ceremonies
are religious inorigin,” Dunham
said.”If you want to hang on to
something in its authenticity,
sometimes you have to go way
back, see which gods they wor-
shipped.”

Dunham, who was born in
Joliet, Il|., did not limit her studies
to dance while she was a student.
She was influenced by a Univer-
sity of Chicago anthropologist
and the chairman of African
studies at Northwestern Univer-
sity. She did field studies of dance
in Africa and the Caribbean.

She used those dances in her
own choreography, trying to
keep the spirit of the original.

Her first dance school opened
in 1931 in Chicago. Her compa-
ny of women performed at the
World's Fair in 1934 and at Car-

negie Hall in 1935;

and nauseous at the same time.”

Of his affiliation with David
Letterman, Altman told of the
time Letterman's talent co-
ordinator, a former Nixon aide,

[had arranged a meeting with him-

self, Letterman, Altman and the
former president. In the past, Alt-
man's act was largely based on
jokes about Nixon, and when in-
troducedto him, he claimed that

Nixon responded, ”Who the fuck
are you?” ..

Altman then closed with some

jabs at the mentality of profes-

sional boxers, thanked the au-
dience for the response they gave
him and vanished off into the
Oakland night.

The program was sponsored by”
the Pitt Program Council.

The intro to ”One Step Ahead

HowdoesPittsburgh rate as a rock birthplace?

By Jeff Maffe

Staff Writer

There was a time in the late
'50s and early '60s when bands
and groups from Pittsburgh
were making it big nationally.
There was Tommy James and
the Shondells and a variety of
other groups that had a hit or
two.

Then you also had George
Benson, who, of course, has be-
come a legend in jazz. Butthen
think about it. Who else_from
the Pittsburgh area has made it
big?

Think of other major cities
and the impact that some of
them have had on rock ’n’ roll.
In the _'60s, San Francisco was
the hub of hippiedom, and also
a hub for musicians. The Grate-
ful Dead and Jefferson Airplane
were two of the big name bands
to come from the Bay area. In
later times, Journey and Santana
formed in the bay area.

Los Angeles is the metal cap-
ital, with such groups as Motley
Crue, Ratt, Quiet Riot and a few
other famous head—banging

’ Mr. Misterdep

Broken wings? Mr. Mister soars on with a new sound that incorporates jazz and rhythm

for music with depth.
By Walter Berry

Associated Press Writer

After Mr. Mister’s last LP
produced a multi-platinum sur-

, prisefor RCA Records, most mu-

sic critics assumed the next al-
bum would simply follow the
same formula.

Go On has proved them
wrong.

”We felt it was important to
take the next step,” said bassist
and lead singer Richard Page.
”You want to stay on top. You
want to be successful and every-

, thing, but not at the expense of

just perpetuating a sound. I don't
find that to be very creative or ful-
filling. We just wanted to go on,
go a step further. Hopefully,
we've done that.”

The recent release was
produced in part by Kevin Killen,
who engineered Peter Gabriel's

‘done/’

\

smash album, 50. It is a stark
departure from Mr. Mister’s

ent, and it's a change for us, but
there's more depth to it. We wer-
en’t following any formula this
time,” guitarist Steve Farris said.

”lt’s less machiney, and the lyr-
ics are great on this record,” said
drummer Pat Mastelotto. ”We’ve
really come a long way.”

Most of the album's 10 songs
deal with world problems or with
the , struggle for spiritual
redemption.

”Dust” is a haunting, Third
World—accented tune about
Amerasian children who were
fathered by soldiers in Vietnam,
stranded there when the war end-
ed and now ostracized and or-
phaned in large numbers.

Royalties from the song benefit

which the address is printed in

THE PITT NEWS

Ex-Panther
unsure of
cause for
Seahawk
struggle

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

The Seattle Seahawks are in
trouble. And Tony Woods knows
it.

Woods, a rookie outside line-
backer from the University of
Pittsburgh, is painfully watching
his highly talented football team
slowly drift out of "playoff conten-
tion. Not being able to pinpoint
the team's problem makes it all
the worse.

‘'1 can't figure it out,” grumbled
Woods after the Seahawks’ 13-9
loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers this
past Sunday. ”This team is one of
the most talented in the league.
1 have no idea what the problems
are. We were doing so well ear-
ly in the season.”

Indeed they were. After an un-
expected blowout loss to the
Denver Broncos on the opening
week of the season, Seattle won
seven of its next nine games and
had itself in excellent position to
secure a playoff birth — especial-

ly when considering the medi-

ocre parity in the league's AFC
East and Central divisions.

Then came a Monday night
massacre at the hands of the LA
Raiders. Bo Jackson and compa-
ny rushed for a whopping 356
yards in pummeling Seattle 37-14
at the Kingdome, a place where
the‘ Seahawks rarely lose.

Next, Chuck Noll’s Pittsburgh
Steelers ‘churned out 209 yards
rushing and outslugged Seattle to
hand the- team its fifth loss.

The implication of these
defeats? Well, the Raiders were
basically all but eliminated, even
though the divisional loss could
become a factor in case of a tie-
breaker. But if a wild—card spot
came down between Pittsburgh

' and Seattle, the Steelers would
qualify as a direct result of head-

to-head competition.
Seattle is currently in_ third

place in the AFC West, while the

Steelers are tied for first in the
AFC Central. Both teams are 7-5.
The bottom line of the ’Hawks
demise is this: The run defense is
flat out failing. And December,
the month of the moment of,
truth, is the worst time it could

Seahawk rookie linebacker Tony Woods, seen here as a Pitt Panther, has made his presence known in the NFL.‘

have happened.

Looking back, this sort of thing
wasn't supposed to take place in
the Northwest —— then again, the
defending Super Bowl champion
New York Giants weren't sup-
posed to belly up like dead stur-
geon either.

Seattle was picked by many to
reach the Super Bowl after its
strong five-game winning streak

at the end of the 1986 season.
The Seahawks finished 10-6 but
failed to qualify for a wild—card
spot due to regular season losses
to Kansas City and the New York
Jets. -
The offense was already solid,
frequently explosive, and what
was considered to be the team's
only defensive weakspot, the
linebacking positions, was quick-

ly patched up in the college draft
with the selection of first-rounder
Woods, then Oklahoma's con-
troversial Brian Bosworth in the
supplemental draft.

Bosworth was handed a start-
ing position almost immediately
after joining the club, but it took
an injury to linebacker Bruce
Scholtz to thrust Woods into the
starting lineup.

Woods has performed quite
well at times this season. Playing
against the Steelers wasn't one of
thosetimes. He contributed no
tackles, no assists, no sacks. And
Pittsburgh ran at his left side all
day.

- ’’It seemed they knew what
defenses they were in,” ex-
plained Woods. ”They were call-

MacPherson hopes his team won't be left out

By Hershel Nissenson

- AP Football Writer

‘Oklahoma is ranked No. 1, and
Miami is No. 2, but not everyone
is convinced that their Orange
Bowl clash, the 23rd such game
in the 52-year history of The As-
sociated Press poll, will decide
college football’s national cham-
pionship. '

Syracuse University Coach,
Dick'MacPherson is among the

dissenters.

Only two teams have a shot at
going 12-0 — the Oklahoma-
Miami winner and fourth-ranked
Syracuse, which meets No. 6 Au-
burn, 9-1-1, in the Sugar Bowl.
Third-ranked Florida State, 10-1
with a 26-25 loss to Miami the
only blemish on its record, plays
No. 5 Nebraska, 10-1, in the Fies-
ta Bowl.

’’Oklahoma and Miami are

son said. ”Any team that wins the
Southeastern Conference is a
good opponent."

Miami completed its second
consecutive 11-0 regular season
by defeating South Carolina

which finished 11-0 two weeks
earlier, received 47 of '57 first-
place votes and 1,129 of a possi-

1,088 points went to_ Miami,
while Florida State remained
third with 1,018 points. The other

cuse, which received 955' points.

mained No. 6 with 847 points.

‘For university administrations,
the bowl season means anywhere
from one-quarter of a million to
six million dollars for the athlet-
ic department coffers. For the
players, the bowl season means
trips to exotic and exciting places
like Memphis, Tennessee. And
for the fans, particularly the foot-
ball junkies with cable TV, the
bowl season means 18 glorious
games over a period of 22 days.

The Orange Bow|’s gamble of
inviting Miami before the Hurri-
canes played Notre Dame and
South Carolina has paid off, as
Miami’ has crushed the Irish and
nipped the Gamecocks to set up
one of the all-time matchups.
Remember, the boys from ”San

that has proven capable over the
last few years of beating the

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, December 9, I987

  Landry remains
 Cowboys’coach

By Denne H. Freeman
AP Sports Writer

IRVING, Texas — Tom Landry,
in the face of criticism from the
team owner, said Tuesday he in-
tends to coach the Dallas Cow-
boys until 1989.

"I knew it would take three
years to bring the team back into

contention again when I signed _

my contract," Landry said.
"There is no magic to it."

Landry was heavily criticized
for the first time by principal
owner Burn Bright after Sunday's
21-10 loss to Atlanta that dropped
the Cowboys to a 5-7 record and
all but eliminated them from the
NFL playoffs. '

"|’ve been down a little bit, but
that's part of football. To receive
criticism from_ an owner was a
deviation from the past a little
bit,” Landry said.

Still, Landry said he expects to
keep coaching.

"Nobody can predict what's
going to go on. I don't intend to
retire before then, but you never
know.”

Club President Tex Schramm
also said he expects Landry to

~ continue coaching.

"What's happened this year in-
creases the challenge,” Schramm
said.

Bright said after the Atlanta

game that he was '.'horrified" at,

some of the play calling, and he
criticized Landry's failure to make
greater use of defensive lineman
Danny Noonan, the team's first-

round draft choice, and running -

back Herschel Walker.
Landry was asked if Bright was

suggesting plays to run, and he
replied, ’'If he wants to try one,
I'll welcome him.” ‘

The late Clint Murchison, the
Cowboys’ original owner, once
repeatedly asked Landry to try
Bob Hayes on a certain play. Lan-
dry did, the play lost 12 yards,
and the coach never heard from
him again.

Washington Coach Joe Gibbs
defended Landry in a phone
hookup with the Dallas media on
Tuesday.

"Coach Landry is a one of the
guys all the younger coaches in
the NFL would like to be like,"
Gibbs said. "He has been a suc-
cess over a long period of time.”

The Cowboys travel‘ to
Washington Sunday to meet the
9-3 Redskins who have already
clinched the NFC East.

"Washington doesn't have to
win the game except for what
they think about the Cowboys,”
Landry said. "They remember we
beat them twice two years ago,”
he said.

"We expect Dallas to be in a
foul mood. The rivalry is still
there,” Gibbs said.

Danny White will return as the
starting quarterback for the Cow-
boys, Landry said. ,

Steve Pelluer, who suffered a
knee injury on the fourth play of
the loss to the Falcons, was mov-
ing better on Tuesday and could
play. '

”I will work Danny in there
and see what he can do for us,"
Landry said. ''If White is going
good, then that is our best chance
to win the game.”

Iowa, Pitt and Penn State.

Last week, it was Oklahoma
State, Notre Dame, Clemson, Ge-
orgia, Texas A&M, Tennessee,
Southern Cal, Iowa, Pitt and Penn
State. The Top 20 consists of the
same teams as last week with
some minor shuffling of po-
sitions.

The last team to go 12-0 and
fail to win the national champi-
onship was Arizona State, which
finished second behind 1 1-1 Ok-
lahoma in 1975.

The Syracuse Orangemen be-
gan the season unranked and
didn't crack the Top 20 until the
fifth week of the season. Then
they climbed steadily from 17th
to 13th to ninth to eighth to sixth
and finally to fourth, where they
have spent the last three weeks
behind Florida State.

"Everyone thinksFlorida State
is for real and Syracuse is not for
real,'' MacPherson said. "If we're
12-0, nothing can go bad for us,
in my opinion. If we're not 12-0
—— see you later."

”We’ve all progressed to
where we can be. The NCAA
says we can't go any further [no
playoff], so we'll take whatever
they [the voters] give us."

ing the right plays, but when you
really come down to it, it was us
against them, man on man, and
they won. We knew [Pittsburgh]
would try to run the ball on us.
We couldn't stop it,and that's all
it came down to." _
Bosworth led the team with

-eight tackles.

Seattle can still qualify-for the
playoffs, even win the AFC West
outright, but it's not in control of
its own destiny. It must win the
rest of its games and hope a few
clubs do some losing along the
way.

But the road ahead is awfully
difficult. The Seahawks tangle
with division-leading Denver in
the Kingdome this weekend, then
they travel to Chicago (10-2) and
Kansas City to finish the season.

"I believe we can bounce back
from [losses to LA and Pitts-
burgh]," said Woods. "We've got
to concentrate on what we're do-
ing. We've had our opportunities,
but it's not all over yet."

Yeah, but it's getting awfully
close.

THE PITT NEWS,‘ Wednesday, December 9, 1987  

‘ROMAN

By Paul Nowell

Associated Press Writer

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Clemson
football coach Danny Ford said
Tuesday he has no plans to
change his conservative ap-
proach when he prepares his
Tigers for Penn State in the Citrus
Bowl on New Year's Day.

”I don't know if the game's go-
ing to be the good, the bad and
the ugly," Ford told reporters.
”But if it is, I hope we're the
good, the bad and the ugly.”

Clemson, 9-2, is a run-oriented
team for an obvious reason", he

- said.

”I wish w_e could throw bet-
ter,” Ford said. ”I’d like to have
a little more balanced attack. But
we're just going to do what we
do best."

Clemson ran all the way to the
Atlantic Coast Conference cham-
pionship and a Top 20 finish in
1987.

The Tigers averaged nearly 250
yards a game on the ground be-
hind the efforts of fullback Tracy
Johnson and tailbacks Terry Allen
and Wesley McFadden.

Ford was asked if he might con-
sider opening up his offense fol-
lowing the disappointing 20-7

S loss in the final, regular—season A
' game to South Carolina, in which

the Tigers were held to 166 total

yards. .
’’Absolutely not,” he said. ”I’m

as hardheaded as that wall. We‘

just need to do what we can do
a little better.”

Ford said he hasn't had the op-
portunity to review‘ films of Penn
State, which is coming off a 21-20
upset of Notre Dame on Nov. 21.
The victory improved the Nitta-
ny Lions’ record to 8-3 and ena-
bled them to hold onto their No.
20 ranking in The Associated
Press poll.

The Citrus Bowl will be the first
meeting between Clemson and
Penn State. '

”I see it as a good chance to _

see how CIemson’s_ program is
coming along compared with a
team that's been there many,
many years,” Ford said. ”They
have a solid program, and you
can't forget that they are the
defending national champions.”

Ford said he has been in-
troduced to Penn State's Joe
Paterno but said he wouldn't say
they are friends.

”I do know he'll beat your
brains out if you're not careful,’'
he said. ‘(They have a tremen-
dous amount of pride in their
football program.”

Clemson, which finished 14th
in the final regular season AP poll
released Tuesday, will have to
play a near-perfect game to beat

Clemson to stick with run

Penn State, Ford said.

”Right now after our last game

[South Carolina] we'd like to beat
anyone to get the bad taste out of
our mouths,_” he said. ”But I real-
ly like to beat the people with big
names like Notre Dame, Ohio
State and Nebraska. There's a lit-
tle pocket change there.”
' In order to beat Penn State, he
said, they will have to contain
tailback Blair Thomas, who post-
ed eight 100-yard games this
season.

Led by Al|—America tackle
Michael Dean Perry's 10 sacks
and 24 tackles for loss, Clemson
ranked second in the nation in
rushing defense, allowing just 80
yards a game.

”Coach Paterno has said Tho-
mas is the most exciting and
talented running back he's ever
had," Ford said. ”And he's had
some great ones. He's in some
pretty high cotton, I'd say.”
