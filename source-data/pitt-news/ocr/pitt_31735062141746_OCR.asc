Some Achieve Total

Nine of the fourteen nationality
room commi-ttees for the Cathedral
of Learning have obtained from one-
third to all of the funds necessary
for the complettion of their respective
rooms, according to reports present-
ed last week to Dr. John G. Bowman,
Chancellor of the University, at thei
annual dinner given by him for the’
Cathedral committee of the Univer-
sity.

Collect Funds of Two Rooms

Both the German and the Jugosla-
vian groups have obtained all funds
necessary to their budgets, while -de-
signs fon the,-Huvngarian, Russian, and
Italian rooms have been completed.
Final drawings for the Czechoslova-
kian, Polish, and Chinese rooms will
be ready for approval very shortly,
and the Greek committee is at present
working on plans for classical design
in the Greek room instead of the
Byzantine architecture previously
considered.

Because of conditions in that coun-
try there has been a hold-up in the
work of the Chinese room, but the
committeehas already collected'suf-
ﬁcient.’- funds and presented com
plete enough plans to be given offic-
ial status _-by the University, and de-
spite this condition, Dr. C. F. Lai,
Chinese committee head, has already
received assurance that the Chinese
government will make good its prom-
ise.

Organize New Room Committees.

To‘date only the Italian, Scandina-
vian, Lithuanian, French, and Scotch
committees have not collected suf-
ﬁcient. funds for official rating, and
of these the French and Lthnunaian
committees have been organized only
within the past few weeks. Of the
two committees not present at the
dinner the Roumanian group is rec-
ognized as official and the Scotch
commit-tee has 9 been too recently or-
ganized to present a deﬁnite report.

“Galen and H. rvey” will be the sub-‘
sect of a talk by Dr. James D. Heard,
professor of medicine, at a public
meeting of Sigma Xi at the Frick
Training School tomorrow evening at
8:15 o’clock. More than 500 people
are expected to hear the address.

Preliminary to the public meeting,
Sigma Xi, honorary scientiﬁc frater-
nity, will hold a banquet with Dr.
Heard as guest of honor at the ‘-Cathe-
dral Mansions at 6 o’clock. There
will be no dinner-speakers in order to
enable__ the Doctor and members of
the society to arrive at the Frick
school on time.

The talk is to be the ﬁrst of a series
of discussions on current topics trac-
ing the relationships of science with
other professions. In the course of
the evening, Dr. Heard expects to out-
line major signiﬁcances of the contri-
butions of Galen, the ﬁrst great
anatomist, and Harvey, discoverer of.
the circulatory system, to modern
medicine. He will alsoexplain fac-
tors in the lives of these two men
which were conducive to their dis-
coveries.

Dr. Williams’ talk will be the third
of a series dealing with international
problems, and will provide a supple-
ment to that of Harry N. Holmes two
weeks ago. Mr. Holmes, a world
Itraveler, provided the background. for
a discussion on the Lytton report by
explaining, “The Far East——World
Danger Zone."

Dr. Williaxn-s= returned early in--Octo-
ber from a. seven-weeks’ visit to Ge-
neva, Switzerland, where he studied
the relations of the League of Nations
to the United States. During his
stay, the ‘Lytton affair, and the Jap-
anese-Chinese controversy : in general,
’occupied"‘«'th’e* attention‘ of ‘the *league
almost to the exclusion of everything
else.

Harry N. Holmes told the Inquiry,,
“China and Japan must cooperate, if
they are to accomplish anything bene-
ﬁcial.” Dr. Williams will discuss
the possibilities of an agreement be-
tween China and Japan.

 

Dr. Graper Tells Frosh
He Is Against Sales Tax

 

Dr. Elmer D. Grapcr, head of the
department of political science, spoke
to the Thursday Fr-eshn1an’s Club on
“Economic Problems.”

In his talk, Dr. Graper stated that
the basic cause of the current depres-

sion is due to the unequal distribu-
tion of wealth and unfair taxation. He
expressed himself as being against
the sales tax.

Debt Payment Detrimcntol
To England,

Entire World

England's forthcoming payment to
the United States of $95,500,000.00 on
December 15, is contingent upon a re-
vision of the whole debt problem. The
rumpus and stir this payment is caus-
ing in the ranks of the French and Ger-
man peoples has become a matter of
concern, uneasiness, or just plain
amusem-ent to the average American.

Although England: will pay if we de-
mand it, Mr. Gerken thinks that such
a demand would be a severe blow to
her treasury. He says, “If England
could spend this money she is accum-
ulating for the meeting of her debt-
payment, for purchases of United
States products, the beneﬁt to this
country would be much greater.”

noon.

Speaking before the Men’s Club of
the First Lutheran Church last night,
two teams from the Men’s Debating
Association discussed the electric
utility situation in the United States
under present state regulation and
considered the merits of government
ownership of the utility industry.

Doctor Gives Symptoms

 

A lack of air circulation attending
the recent three-day fog which en-
veloped the city, has given rise to a
mild epidemic of inﬂuenza and has
wreaked havoc with school and: col-
lege attendance in the district. The
University's Student Health Clinic to-
day made public after a preliminary
examination of many cases called to
its attention, a diagnostic study of
the disease to check further spread
among students.

Cold ls Symptom

“The appearance of inﬂuenza,”
said Dr, H. C. Carlson, director of
the health service, “is seen by a slight
cold, running of the nose, watery
eyes, and a feeling of weakness, nau-
sea, and heaviness. A mild attack of
this disease may lower the resistance
of the body and make one more sus-
ceptible to a second attack, which
m-ay ﬁnally terminate in the patient’s
contraction of pneumonia."

The causes of inﬂuenza are laid to
poor bodily elimination, lowering of
body resistance, and weather condi-
tions arising from poor air circula-
tion.

Urging students to take preventa-
tive steps -toward checking the fur-
ther rise of the disease, Dr. C-arlson
urged that students take long rest
periods, use a restricted diet of light
and liquid foods, avoid drafts and
dress warmly.

Improper Ventilation

“One fact we have found in our ex-
amination of students,” said Dr. Carl-
son, “is that students using gas
stoves in their rooms to provide heat
forget a little matter of ventilation."
Windows should be left open a little
to drive out the stale air and the
gases resulting from heating by this
method, believes Dr. Carlson, to in-
sure an inlet of fresh air for breath-
mg.

No serious cases have as yet geen
found by the health service of the
University. “In the main," Dr. Carl-
son said, “an attack wll last for a.
period of three days, but the attack
leaves the student in a weakened
condition for a like period.”

“Drink plenty of water, keep track
of the little colds, and you won't
need to worry about pneumonia," be-
lieves the student health director.

Mease Wins

Students Direct Thiiee 

 

Present “The Lost Silk Hat,” “Fancy Free,” and “Pov-
erty” at the Falk Elementary School Auditorium

By Sam Honigberg
Three more students turned directors last 'l.‘luirsda_v night. when
“The Lost Silk Hat,” “I*‘ane_v Free,” and “Povert'_v” were present-
ed before a small student audience at the Falk El{‘ll'l(‘l1l£tl')" School
Auditorium. It was tlie second and last group of plays given by the
Pitt Players before the C-liristnias holidays.
Under the direction of C‘l1arlcs Foreman. Lord Dunsan_v’s well-

known “Lost. Silk Hat” served as

the curtain raiser. The story re-

veals the strange predicament of 21%

gentleman who had a. lover’s quarrel}
with his girl friend and in the hast-ei
of leaving forgot his hat. '

There he stands in the street stop-
ping passers-by and asking them to
get the hat for him. A dandy, a
clerk, and a. poet walk by. Here. the
director deviated from the original
plot. He omitted the parts of the
laborer and the policeman and sub-
stituted the dandy iiisteud. The act
ends with-‘ the caller himself entering
the house for the hat while poet re-
mains in the street reciting verses of
love. Herbert Fine stood out as the
dandy because of the clever way he
delivered the cockney accent. George
Strong, as the caller; Forrest Altar.
as the clerk, and Marquis Patterson
satisfactorily handled the other parts
of the play.

“Poverty,” a translation from a
Norwegian mood play, concerns a.
father. mother. and daughter. starved,
distressed, and aged with worry. The
act throughout is a powerful scene.
It was made more realistic through
Jeanne Clizbe’s. foi'cet’ul performance
as the daughter. The parts of the
father, mother, and son were well
played by John Neary, Agnes Cala-
brese, and Adolph Behrenberg. Bar-
bara Aiin -Ha.rt1nan’s direction was
good.

Stanley Hougliton’s sophisticated
little comedy, “Fancy Free,” under:
the direction of Edna‘ Landman, con-
cluded the evening‘s program. The
play is a. merry mix-up of wife, hus-
band, and their illicit sweetliearts.
The comedy reaches itspeak when
Fancy Free. the wife; and her “boy
friend.” me-t Fancy’s husband and his
“girl friend.” Charlotte Walker as De-
lie the sweetheart and Helen _Bair,
as Fa.ncy_ wore stunning gowns. The
latest styles in tuxedos were dis-
played by Charles Perrine, who played
Fancy-"s husband. and Herbert GWYGIG
who portrayed the “other man.”

Brandon, Duncun Debate
Arms At Monday Y Club

At the meeting. of the Monday

sent whirling down the alley.

This game set a new iiitex-fraternity
team record with the scores of 588-
605: 587-571; and 699-688. At the end
of the evening the team scores showed
only a. di1‘rTei'eiice of ten points for the
three ganies. the Theta C—l1i’s having
a total of 1864 with the “Sammys"
edging past with 1874.

The match was featured with ﬁne
bowling, \Voods and Beistel leading.
with Kaufman and Gladstone shining
for the “Sa.mmys.”

The scores for the Delta Tau Delta-
Pi Lambda Phi match were 530-495;
570-435; and 520-491. Neither the

Never Pressed For Lead

By Mesmer Team

 

.--——

Rule Changes Applied

The general impression after Satur-
day night's ‘Pitt-Georgetown game
was that the 1932-33 Pitt ﬁve is a,
well coached outﬁt that is probabl_v;
“going to town.” At. least the Pan-
thers had no trouble winning over a

mediocre. Georgetown ﬁve by the
score of 32-18.
Pitt's starting lineup of Captain

Smith. Hughes, Cribbs, Or-hsenhirt.
and McCamant repeatedly advanced
the ball down the court, never tarry-
ing long enough to test the new ten-1
second rule and popped away success- 
fully at the Hoya basket all nightf
Skip Hughes led the scoring for Pitt
with two field goals and four fouls.i
Ilargaden of Georgetown sank two'-
ﬁeld goals and six fouls.
Ochsenhirt Well Placed

The new lineup with Smith at for-§
ward and Ochsenltirt at guard seems'
a big improvement over last year
when Smitty was at guard and Dutch
at‘ center. Ochsenhirt pa1‘.t_icu.larly
seemed more at home, adopting an
aggressiveness that was not a notice-'
able part of his play last season.
Cribbs got the jump all evening and
controlled the ball well at the back-
board. Skip Hughes ﬁts nicely into
the fast Carlson system and McCa-
mant kept the Hilltoppers’ shots
down to a minimum. The team’s
ﬁnesse seemed to drop off noticeably
when substitutes entered the game.

Coach Mesmer’s ﬁve scored the
ﬁrst point of the game when M_urpl1'y
dropped in a foul. But soon after-
ward .Ochsenhirt’s ﬁeld goal_ placed
Pitt in the lead from where they were
never routed.

The Hoyas came within three
points of Pitt at the half coming.-
from behind to ma.ke the score, 14-11
after Pitt led 14-5. Don Smith, Skip
Hughes. and Russ Ochsenhirt scored
in rapid succession after the intermis-
sion to make the score 22-ll almost
before Georgetown could regain their
balance. Five minutes of the second
half were gone before Connors scored.
the ﬁrst points for Georgetown.

New Rule Applies

The new rules required but one in-
te.rpret.a.tion during the game. This
came when Charley Hughes accident-
ally stepped back over the line after
receiving a pass from out of bounds.

Officials Beggs Snyder and Leo.
lvlackey called thirt.y-three fouls dur-
ing the game. Pitt sank only eight
out of 15 and Georgetown only eight,
out of 18. Smith and Ochsenhirt of’
Pitt and Crowley and Carolan oft
('.leor,2:etown were banished on person-I
al fouls’.

 

Schenley Hizagers
Lose To Frosh 29-20

A not too good looking freshman
team started their season with a. 29-
2-0 victory over Schenley High school
in  preliminary to the varsity game.
Sullivan, former Homestead star, led
the scoring with four ﬁeld goals a.nd
two fouls. Dayoub, Doepken, and
Bache also found the nets.

VVhile the ﬁrst string played during.
the first half. the frosh clearly out.-
played the young Schenley team
though Gates, stout colored forward,
for Schenley gave a neat. display of
ball handling. During the second
half the Belleﬁeld high school boys
scored the same number of points, 10,
as did Pitt.

The varsity football squad and
members of VVAA have been invited
by Coach Pat Corr and his men swim-
mers to splash around at an informal
‘swimming party tomorrow night in
[the Trees Gym pool following the
5varsity-freshman meet. The meet is
lscheduled to start at 7:30 o'clock and
lthe party inimcdi-.1tel_\' after the end
of the races.

Coach Corr will be in charge of the
varsity swimmers while Georgre Lee,
assistant. coach of swimzniug, will pick
the entries for the frosh. The com-
petitive or team angle is being
stressed as much as possible in this
‘intro-team event in order to give the
"varsity swinlmers as much practice
i-as possible before the meets with
l.Ha.rvard and Yale, January 13 and 15.

Russell Lindbe1'g, former Home-
stead Library star, is calculated to
give the varsity much trouble. It- is
doubtful if any varsity freestyler can
‘keep "up with the diminutive fresh-
3man. The backstroke too, s likely
to go to the fresh with ilones and
Szawsuk easily stepping away from
the best the varsity can offer. Lcbed-
.<la may capture the 440, but there-
after any freshman superiority ends.

Breaststroke with Srhmciler and Ad-
llersberg is an assured varsity Sweep.

will probably come in the 160-yard re-
lay. vThe varsity team of Denny,

Student Relations’ Rules

activities leaders throughout the

It has long been felt that too little was known about Student

Relations Committee, its general

powers of formulating the rules

governing social affairs and entertainment, and its particular func-

tions in connection with the enforcement of these doctrines.
VVhether or not we care to admit it, the purely social aspects of

University life are more widely the concern of undergraduates than

are any of the other ﬁelds of interest outside the classroom.

A major

class dance or the annual Yuletide Festival excites more comment
and receives more direct support than does any _politica.1 symposium

or meeting of student religious leaders.
That '8 us as we are...

nothing could be more logical than that knowledge of the powers
of Student Relations Committee and its standing‘ rules should sup-
plant the widespread student ignorance on the business of regulating

their good times.

The pamphlet of “Rules for Student Orga.nizat.ions” was pub-
lished primarily for use by dance chairmen, org-anization officers
and social chairmen of campus fraternities. Many students, how-
ever, are-called to serve on dance and cn_terta.in_mcnt. committees from

time to time, their duties calling

for an exercise of authority that

places them under the jurisdiction of this important committee "of
Student Council. In order that such persons and all members of the
student body may have first hand knowledge of the powers and
duties of Student Relations, the News today has reprinted “Rules

for Student O1‘g'a11izations. ”

ll/Iiicli of the niisundcrstancling of the duties of this committee
and the ‘extent of its nifluence over campus events, we hope, will be
cleare_d up by the original publication and the present .reprintin,;-:.
Certainly the pamphlet will more than pay for itself in direct beneﬁt
to both the committee and those who receive it.

QR'FAR BOARD, women ’s hoiiorary activities f'rateruit_v, sock-
ing to enlarge on its program of service to the Uiiivcirsity, has

come forward with a plan for the establishment of a st11Cle11i' book

As yet. the proposal has not received official administra-

tlve sanction, and i'or."c.l1e time,bcing' rcniains under c(msid<=.1*a.t.im1.

The plan, as tentatively outlined, would provide. a clearing‘ house
for second hand textbooks, a studcnt—operatcd cxcliaiigrc which
would function only for a brief period between -.;cu'1cstcrs in Feb-
ruary and for a similar time before the opening“ of classcgs in Septem-
ber. The purpose of the cxcliangc is a worthy one. It would cmiblc
‘m.a.n_v students of limited means both to buy and to sc.'l.l tlie. books
required for courses in any school of the U nivcrsity.

I Dohner Says Engineers

Need Knowledge Of Art

Donald R. Dohner, director of art
for the Vllestinghouse Electric and
Maiuifacturing Company, was guest,
speaker at the regular weekly semi-
nar meeting of the student branch
of the American Institute of Electri-
cal Engineers, Thursday morning.

Mr. Dohner spoke on “The Need forl
‘holic content.

Art in Industry.” In the course of
his talk, he brought out his point by
citing the development of the Ford a.u-
tomobile, Tlfhen this machine was
first manufactured, according to Mr.

Dohner, it was made on a scale that‘

allowed wide sale amnog people who
otherwise could not afford cars. No
art or artistic embellishments were
needed. However. with the enroach-
ing into the cheap car class of so
many automobiles, the Ford, from
necessity, land to undergo a reforma-
tion. Today, the Ford, still a. cheap
car, has chromium plating. stream
lines. and a beauty to compete with
all cars of its class.

Cheer For Pitts

By Jack Bunker

“Prosperity is just around the con!

ner,” or so We heard in '30, in '31 the
boys who knew said, “Recovery is
just over the horizon," and now those
who have their golden opinions in-
scribed in the contemporary news
sheets of the clay, tell us, “Times are
improving; buy that baby carriage
today.” It may be right and it may
be wrong that better days are loom-
ing ahead; no one knows for sure,
and the economists who have opin-
ions are keeping them to themselves;
but We can get a bit of cheer from
the lastrissue-of the Pittsburgh Busi-
ness Review, monthly survey of
economic conditions published by the
Bureau of Business Research at the
University.

According to the Review, “Busi-

The political cartoons and editorials

that followed 1ast'lVLonday's unsuc-'

cessful attempt to jam in repeal bill
through the opening session of the
House of Representatives are getting
:1 little tiresome. If the public ex-
pected anything but defeat for that
bill, the public is a. good deal more
gullible than I would have believed.
People are expecting too much of the
lame ducks. WVe have never got much
from a disowned House of Representa-
tives before. And there is little or no
reason for the session ol;"'tl1e‘ year
1932 being different from the rest.
The chief complaint seems to be
that the office holders had a repeal
mandate from the voters, and that the
mandate was disregarded. That is
nothing pa.rticularly now. Hoover had

garded that. So far as I am con-
cerned, I wouldn't care if Congress
made a. practice of never considering
the folks back home. If Congre:-is
merely acted intelligently, I should be
satisﬁed.
An Ill-Advised Move

The fact that the Garner bill for
the repeal of the Eigliteentli Amend-,
mcnt was defeated is neither surpris-
ing no1' discouraging (for the wets,
of course). The introduction of that
bill so early in the session was cer-

]'d111 it through inn few hours smacked
oi‘ s_tea.m roller tactics on an lSS‘«.l9
which, if it is to be solved for all)’

length of time and solved well, will

In the first place. there are in the
House a. few men of intelligence who
do not run mad on an issue as soon
as their home town papers begin
printing bugle-call editorials on the
front page. From such men we can

expect little entliusiasm for such a,

bill as the one that was turned down
on Monday. They know that prob-
lems accumulated in the past. twelve
years cannot be repealed in an hour.
They know that a. carefully designed
law. not a demagogue;-.'s gesture, must
take the place of the Prohibition
amendment.

Besides. there are :1. lot of wobbly
Drys. They are willing to play ball
on  light wine and beer bill, If Con-
.‘2,rcssiona1 leaders are sincere in their
concern over America's parched
throat, they will give those Drys a
glove and bat, and let them play.
The opening innings of such a game
seem to be in progress right now.

The Political Panacea

Up to now the proposals for dry
law modiﬁcation have been for the
most part futile. Modiﬁcation is a
political sure-thing; it appeases the
bowling of the Wets a little, and the
Drys run no high temperatures over
the prospect of it. As one of our
humorous magazines remarked dur-
ing the fall campaign. “2.75 per cent
beer may be good politics, but it'is
damned poor beer.” Veterans of the
almost forgotten prewar days assure
me that the ﬁne Pilsners and other
Bohemian brews were all of high alco-

With even a more or less satisfac-
tory settlement of war debts, revenue.
prohibition, and the hundred other
problems that face Congress now.

there is a temptation to find fault
with the operations of both Houses;
It is :1 general belief that the best sub-,3
ject for a. wise-crack is the Federal;
Government. Most certainly, the!
House. of Representatives and thei
Senate have pulled stunts that inadef

Thwarted intellectuals

Wasliingtoii Works under the greatest
of difﬁculties. He not only must
guard against the thousands of lobbies
which continually offer him tempta-
tions, often subtle and insidious, but
he must always keep his eyes open
for bread and circuses in the form of
new post oﬁices and special. grants
for his constituents, If he depends
upon his salary as 3. public ofﬁcial for
his support, he works in constant fear
of defeat at re-election time, There
are always minority groups in his own
district, ready to misinterpret his
acts. He is in fully as 9. great dan-
ger as the political charlatan, if not
more; for the charlatan thinks in
terms of practical politics rather than
in terms of public welfare. It is a

+g«rea.t~ wonder that -we do have any‘

cool-headed individuztls in politics.
And it is a. great pity that they are so
little appreciated.

An attitude commonly taken by
writers in our “smart” magazines is
that some substitute for rule by the
masses must be found, usually with
the suggestion that only the intel-
lectuals (i. e., the writer and all his
dear readers) are ﬁt to govern.
Egotist psychology explains the popu-

larity of -such an attitude easily
<->noug'l1. The joker in it is that the
“smart” magazines are, consciously

or unconsciously, advocating fascism.
With a. childisli optimism, they as-
sume that the ills of government
must be cured, and that the best way
to cure them is the rule of brains.

No Government Perfect

can ever be got is a. good deal. It
would be wiser to hope for a fairly
good gove.-rnment. Perfect govern-
ment is not extinct; it has just never
existed. As for the assumption that
brains can do more than popular
stumbling, we have had a. few experi-
ments wit.l1 that "sort of thing, and
they-have proved the justice "of our
old faith in a decent compromise,

the most important of these is the
vast number of unemployed, who
have used up, in a great many cases,
all of their savings. In addition, tech-
nological improvement in industry is
expected‘ to continue replacing work-
ers ln -the future; the price situation
is still -severely unadjusted, and for-
eign trade is in a bad way.

Above is a chart prepared by the
Bureau that has been used by bus-
iness men all over this country and in
foreign nations. It shows graphical-

district, one of the mostdihportant
industrial centers of the whole world-,
since 1919. This pictoria1 evidence
of business during recent years is a
ﬁne means for a. comparative study
of conditions; it is interesting to note

.a decided up-trend. during the .1 last-

few months.

so far as the absurdities of our Amer-
ican civilization are concerned, it is
hard to name a nation that does not
produce parallels. The Japanese ﬂock
to the banners of their war-lords and
industrialists to die in wars which
mean nothing. The Italian masses
swallow the blood-lust propaganda of
the Fascists, And the Germans

.fu1 intellectuals) -- have». their -. Adolf -

Hitler. It took the democracies of
France and England more than ten
years to do something about the bar-
baric terms of the Treaty of Ver-

sailles. —

Our democracy is not such an awful
wa.sl1-out. Considering all the forces
that work against it, it is remarkable
how well it does operate.
