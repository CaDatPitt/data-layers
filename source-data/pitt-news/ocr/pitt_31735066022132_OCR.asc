Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh doctors

transplanted a heart "into the youngest '

person ever to survive the operation. The
baby girl, Sarah Kelton, received the heart
during a six-hour operation that began
Sunday at 11:10 pm".

Kelton was only in her mother’s womb
for 35 weeks before she was delivered by
caesarian section Sunday afternoon. She
was ﬁve weeks premature and weighed
about 5.2 pounds. ,

Dr. Pedro Del Nido performed the heart
surgery, assisted by Dr. John Arrnitage.

“The chances of the baby surviving are

S0 to 60 percent now. A We are pleased

where she is,” Armitage said.

Kelton is in critical condition and is
receiving the anti-rejection drug FK506.
The ‘most critical period will be her first
week of life, Armitage said. “At this_point,
infection is her greatest risk.” '

Kelton was first diagnosed as having
hypoplastic left-heart syndrome at
Allegheny General Hospital as a 17-week-
old fetus.

This syndrome is representative of a
group of abnormal heart conditions.
Kelton’s heart had only two chambers
instead of the normal four.

Dr. Eugene A. Scioscia Jr. of Allegheny
General said, “Many of these children get
into irreversible difficulty even before the
diagnosis canbe made. M

'"That was a tremendous advantage in
this case of having an answer, or at least

 

 

a partial answer, even before the child was
born,” he said. V «

After that initial diagnosis_Kelton’s’

doctors referred her to the Pediatric Heart
Transplant Program at Children's Hospital.
Nido and Armitage consulted with the

parents and told them they had three.

options. J
The first was to allow the baby to go full
term. 1

This option would have given the infant.

little chance for survival. Only 25 percent
of babies born with HLHS make it through
the first week of life.

After that the death rate increases, until
at six weeks almost all infants die fromthe

-syndrome.

The second option was to reconstruct

Kelton_’s heart through]*a series of

I.

 

 

operations, which would have still only
left her with one ventricle. ; _
The other option was transplantation."

Kelton’s heart condition was worse than » ’ 1
doctors had thought, and by the time they ,
were ready to transplant there were 

difficulties. ~.. g
.Kel_ton was also diagnosed as having

. total anomalous pulmonary venous return,

a condition where oxygenated blood does

not return to the heart because of I

Dear Pitt News,

My roommates and I had a

geeky guy showed up and ended

wanting to be rude, we listened
to what he had to say, forced an
occasional fake laugh at his lame
jokes and even managed to
conjure up a convincing “That’s a
good point” at his weak political
analogies and illogical ramblings
about current events. The
problem is that he has reappeared
at our door every night since the

Dear Greek,

Pledging a sorority is a_ big
‘decision, and a big commitment.
But it can be one of the most
rewarding decisions of your life.
The members of your sorority
are more than your friends -
they are your sisters. I am often
amazed to find that some of my
sorority sisters are as reliable and
as close to me as my real sisters.

All sororities have an exciting
social schedule, but you need to
be aware that there are other
obligations. Many sororities do
community-service projects and

all sororities on campus have
study hours for pledges.

If you have any questions about
the specific process of joining a

answer your questions. The rush
counselors will have a table in

Greeks questionnew alcohol policy

By Jake Brody
For The Pitt News

When the Office of Student
Affairs and the Inter-Fraternity
Council unveiled the new Greek
alcohol policy, they didn’t
realize the uproar it would
cause. As the implementation
of the policy begins, many
Greeks are confused and angry.

Some are unsure if the no-
keg rule is feasible. Others
wonder if the policy will only

‘ encourage the use of hard liquor
at Greek functions instead of
reducing the amount of “bulk
alcohol.”

Derrick St. Clair, social chair
for the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity, said, “I don’t see the
purpose of not having "kegs.
People will still drink, and with
a bring-your-own—beer policy,
people will be more intoxicated
than if they were being served
from kegs.

“The no—keg rule does not
limit drinking; it just will
create more problems. With
kegs, frats were able to control
the amount that people drink.
With bottles and cans, there
will be no way of knowing how
much someone has drunk or
what they have drunk,” St. Clair
said.

Karen Otto, a sister at
Chi Omega, said, “Hard alcohol
could be an alternative to
kegs.” ‘

The policy prohibits the
purchasing of alcoholic
beverages with chapter funds.

Members or guests of the
chapter cannot purchase
alcohol on behalf of the Greek
organization. '

The purchase and use of
bulk quantities of alcohol (such
as kegs) is prohibited.

"1 think that the new policyis
too restrictive in that the
university says that it gives us
more responsibility. But in
actuality, it is taking
responsibility away from us,"

said Bob Bonus of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity.

Rebecca Cohen of Chi Omega
thinks that no kegs will
“be more of a hassle and will
only result in smaller parties.”

“The Greek system will
become more important with
non-Greeks having problems
getting into’Greek parties on
the hill,” Cohen said. “The
parties will be more controlled,
and the Greeks will become
more elite.”

Travis Wellner, social chair
for Phi Kappa Theta Fraternity,
believes the new policy will
“make life more difﬁcult for the
social chairs. Although there
will be more control, there is no
way you can buy the same

amount of alcohol from cans
and bottles as you could have
with kegs."

Not all Greeks feel that the
no—keg rule is a bad policy. But
some said the institutors of the
policy should have consulted
more with the fraternities.

“lSigma Alpha*Epsilonl didn’t
have kegs last year, and
everything was fine. It’s just
going to take a while to catch
on, ” said SAE brotherjon Davis.

Andy Feldman, internal vice-
president of the IFC and Zeta
Beta Tau member, worked on
the policy over the summer.

“As student leaders, the Inter-
Fraternity Council felt that it
was necessary to take a pro-
active stance and to bring about
these policy changes instead of
having the university impose a
more restrictive policy upon
the Greek system.

“We would like to have
consulted all the fraternities,‘
but the policy was in legal
counsel with the university_for
three weeks. The IFC,
unfortunately, didn’t have

copies to distribute to the frats '

until the start of the term,” said
Feldman.

“But if there is any opposition,
frats, have the opportunity to

discuss the policy through their
representatives on the
monitoring committee, and
from there we can take any
amendments to the university
for consideration,” he said.

Feldman indicated that “a lot.

of chapters are restricted by
their national organizations
from serving alcohol at
functions, and with the new

policy we are attempting to

include the other fraternities
which could be held liable for
their actions.” ,
While some Greek members
worry that the university is trying
to phase out the Greek system
by restricting its actions,

. Feldman said, “Other schools .

like Maryland and Syracuse
have similar policies. Indiana
University has a dry campus
and an amazing Greek system.”

The new policy emphasizes
that fraternities and sororities
must abide by Pennsylvania
laws about alcohol,
consumption, possession and
use.

The policy’s goal is to reduce
liability to the fraternities and
sororities and concurrently to
the university, Feldman said.
The rest of the policy dictates

regulations about age
restrictions, notification and
inspection.

Randy Patrinos, president of
Delta Tau Delta Fraternity and
IFC secretary, said, “It was
inevitable, that this would
happen because both state and
federal laws apply to an
institution like Pitt, and with a
past history of a few Greeks
getting into trouble, you end
up setting yourself apart as
Greeks.”

Many Greeks understand that
the policy wants to limit
underage drinking but said they
didn’t see how a no-keg rule
will limit drinking when
students can go to any of the
local bars or drink privately in
their own rooms. ’ '

Former Pitt Professor John A.
Conley was arrested by the FBI
on Monday and charged with
planning to extort $350,000 from
a former business associate. The
arrest came after police saw three
of Conley’s accomplices trying to
set fire to the associate’s car.

Conley is accused of attempting
to extort $350,000 from Arthur N.
Greenblatt of Farmington, Conn.,
according to Detective Jay St.
Clair of the West Hartford. police
department.

Greenblatt, the managing
director of CDC Financial, helped
Conley finance a real—estate
development project in West
Hartford that fell through in 1984,
St. Clair said.

“Somewhere along the way
Conley felt that Greenblatt owed
him money,” St. Clair said.

Several men visited Greenblatt
and threatened him with violence
in May 1991, according to St.
Clair.

Conley was arrested in
Pittsburgh yesterday by FBI agents
after police in West Hartford

apprehended three alleged

associates of Conley for pouring - 

gasoline on Greenblatt’s‘ car.
Conley was released on $10,000
bond.

of the West Hartford police met
Conley and his three accomplices
in Boston Park. Lovett said he

posed as Greenblatt’s associate. .. . 
Conley threatened Greenblatt-

with violence if Greenblatt did

not come up with the $350,000, .

according to Lovett.
“Conley was the ringleader,_

and the three men were working _ _V._:“

for him," Lovett said.

"The federal grand jury in
Hartford returned indictments
against all four men today,
according to Lovett.

Conley retired from Pitt's School
of Social Work a year-and-a-half

ago and was also a member of '

Police distribute whistles

By David T. Welch

Asst. Newsliditor

The campus police are handing out free whistles to first—year
students in an effort to increase awareness of campus safety.

“The whistle has a symbolic purpose. It reminds the students
of their personal responsibility to protect their person and their
assets. It also can be blown to cause attention to our officers.
It has been shown that noise is an effective deterrent to criminal
activity," campus police Sgt. Charles Grier said.

The Department of Public Safety purchased 5,000 whistles.
They were handed out at the Student Activities Fair and will be
distributed to first—year students Sept. 17 to 19 at the William Pitt
Union from 1 to 4 p.m. Upperclass students can purchase the
whistles at cost for $4.20 at the university Book Center.

The Student Government Board, the Book Center and the
Department of Public Safety all contributed equal funding to

V the $6,300 program, according to Andy Gould of the SGB.

Student Affairs contributed $1,800.

Vice President of Student Affairs William Harmon likes the
idea of handing out the whistles. “It appears to be working well.
It was that or selling Mace, but we did not want that because
Mace could be used as a weapon against the students. We did
not want to see students testing it out on each other," he said.

There is some concern that students will test out the whistle
in unnecessary circumstances. “We're hoping that peer pressure
will eliminate a lot of those problems. We gave a videotape to

SGB about the whistle and appropriate instances to use it, and
SGB has promised to get the word out, and we’re- certainly
doing our part in emphasizing the program and when it’s not
appropriate to use it,” Grier said. a

Campus police gave out free whistles at orientation, but
distribution did not go as well as they had hoped. “We’ve had
six orientations with freshmen, and we've passed them out at
each one. Unfortunately many freshmen did not appear at our

V portion of the orientation, so only half of the whistles have

been passed out,” Grier said.

Public safety is taking other steps to decrease crime.. “In the
next month or so a crime-watch program will begin in dorms.
Resident Assistants will be the leaders initially, and they will
set up communications networks to begin with," Public Safety
Director William Brennan said.

By David T. Welch

Asst. News Editor

The battle to preserve the site
of the Syria Mosque has reached
a standstill as City Council voted
yesterday to delay deciding
whether to name the site as
historic until the proposal saw
due process of law.

The move was initiated last
week when council member Jim
Ferlo changed his proposal to
preserving the mosque site but
not the structure. Changing any
proposal after it has been made
requires it to be resubjected to
due process. _

The vote passed 5 to 1 with one
abstention.

“We did not want to eliminate

due process. The solicitor

general’s opinion was that the

bill was altered and there should
be a public hearing [Concerning
the mosque]’’ before any voting
could take place, Ferlo said.
City Council President Jack
Wagner agreed. “We cannot vote
on this. It must go through the
review process,” Wagner said.
The proposal to designate the
site must also go back to the

_ Historical Review Committee for

arecommendation before it can
be voted on.

Should the proposal pass when
it comes back to City Council, the
site of the mosque would be part
of the Schenley Farms Historical
District, which means that City
Council could control what type
of building is put on the site.

‘ City Council could then be sure
that the new building would be
in the character of the other

buildings in the Schenley Farms
District.

Council member Michelle
Madoff said the plans for the new
building seem to show that
the new building will preserve
the architectural integrity of the
area. ~

“I have requested a schematic
of what the proposal will be like

so that the property will be in .

keeping with the other buildings,”
Madoff said.

“What I have seen in the
preliminary drawings is that the
building is not a sheet of glass. It
has a garden courtyard. I think
there has to be some restraint on
that building,” Madoff said.

After the proposal goes through
due process, City Council will
decide on a date to vote on the
proposal..

For Hie Pitt News

They're people most students
see every day. You don't know

their names, but without them _

stomachs would be rumbling all
around the Pitt campus ——
introducing the food-service
employees of the University of
Pittsburgh. _

Talking with students is a
highlight for two-year rookie Nate
Penn, who works in the Towers’
cafeteria.

“I've given advice to lots of
kids. I even helped a student out
in a track race. I gave him a

tip, and he told me later it
worked!”

When asked about the new
president, Penn said, “I didn’t
know the old one. I don't expect
this one to affect me either."

According to Bill Burke, who
also works in the Towers, the
only aspect of his job he doesn’t
like is “when it gets really busy,
no one wants to move. Kids
swarm everywhere.”

His three years of experience
at Pitt have “been a lot of fun. It’s
amazing to see how many
different types of kids with
different kinds of personalities
there are," Burke said.

Mciver Jackson, a part-time
dishroom employee, has been
working here “thirty years
because I love it."

“My wife’s a nursing professor
here. We just can’t get enough of
the Pitt atmosphere,” he said.

Wilhemnia Payne, a line server,
hopes to be here for a while
because it’s a fast-paced job that
always keeps you moving. “The
beneﬁts are good, too," Payne
said.

Thoughts of improving the
cafeteria play on Charlene
McCoy’s mind.

“Students should be able to sit
together more. Table

arrangements need to be altered,”
suggests McCoy.

McCoy enjoys pulling carts and
getting acquainted with students.
She dislikes pupils who get in the
way of her job by being ﬂippant.
She demands a clean cafeteria
because she works there. “I guess
the pay’s livable," she added.

“It’s not a boring job  It’s not
sad. It’s just basic work. I’ll be
here for a while but deﬁnitely not
for the rest of my life," rationalizes
Allan Terry, a cafeteria worker
who tends the salad bar.

“It’s just okay for reasons I'd
rather keep to myself. The kids
are pretty good, but they’re not

John Bynum, affiliated with Pitt
cafeterias for nine years, has seen
a lot of changes.

But since the new food-service
management arrived, the food
has been of better quality, and
the whole atmosphere in general
has been more efficient and
productive, according to Bynum,

His duties include assorting and
stocking eating utensils.

Many of the food-service
employees at Pitt agree that
teamwork is the key to why
they're able to be successful at
their jobs.

“It’s a lot of work to prepare
and serve the food on time,” said
McCoy. “Pulling and doing things
together really make the even-
not—so-good times OK. The secrets
to our job includes patience and
the will to get things done and
get ‘em done right. We know that
the kids aren’t the only ones that
depend on us. A whole mess of
people do,” Jackson said.

Donovan Hughes and Emanuel
Perry are among the Pitt
employees that were placed in
DAKA’s management. All other
food-service employees were

“We just felt that we would be

Chandler hired Roger Bosse to
replace Perry as general manager
of food service. :

“We wanted to clearly separate
ourselves from. from what I
understand to be the activities
and people of the past regime,"
Chandler said. ’

DAKA has also changed the

instituting new financial
procedures, Chandler said. a

“Every single catered event is ‘

invoiced in a sequentially
numbered catering-function
sheet, and those catering-function
sheets have attached to them a

DAKA has also instituted a

It has also restricted the

All of these new policies are

Hughes is charged with theft

He is accused of taking a total
of $8,196.

If convicted,‘ Hughes could

face up to seven years in jail and
$30,000 in fines.

It is important to remember
that Pitt voluntarily brought these
matters to the district attorney,

“We are determined to see that
restoration is made. If there has

Food service scandal

Every day it seems that someone else is stealing money

price. .

Two officials of the food-service department have been
charged with theft from the university. But this time not
only are the numbers shocking, the reasons are, too.

Former Pitt Golden Panther Director Robert Heddleston
was charged in August along with Keith Fammartino,
former president of the Golden Panthers, of placing
$41,627 in a secret bank account. Heddelston was also

accused of taking an additional $14,656 from the club's

funds.
Apparently, Heddleston’s co-workers have followed his
lead. V

Emanuel Perry, former general manager of food services, ’

has been indicted for stealing more than $81,000. This
total, which is five times the approximate cost for a_ four-
year, in-state education at Pitt, was used to purchase
jewelry, liquor, steaks and holiday gifts for other employees
at the university.

Included in the erroneous expenditures are payments
of cash to employees “as a sort of supplement to their
salary so that they would not leave their employment.”
Perry also charged personal trips for himself and others to
Pitt, including a vacation to Ireland towatch the Panther
football team play.

One recipient of these trips was Donovan Hughes,

, former director and Perry’s boss at food services.

Hughes was also charged with theft by deception and
criminal conspiracy. Vacations to California, Washington,
Las Vegas and New York were allegedly included in the
total. , I ‘  '    __ “

Although the quality of the Panther football teamwas
worthy of a bowl game in 1989, the trip to Ireland to watch
a sure Pitt victory over an opponent like Rutgers was not
worth the bill that the university was forced to pay.

The company that Pitt uses to provide food services,
DAKA, fired 16 managers between April 1 ‘and August 16.
They are trying "to reorganize and “separate ‘ourselves
from what I understand to be the activities and people of
the past regime,” according to Mike Chandler, DAKA vice.
president for operations.‘

Three others were also named in the scandal, including
Alan Quinn, who was identiﬁed as a “driver” for Hughes,
since he has no operator’s license.

/This kind of theft at Pitt ‘must come to a stop now.
Students have been footing’ the bill for these outrageous
expenses for years.

Maybe now that DAKA has committed_itself to cleaning
up the food-service department, we can hope for less

.corruption within our administration.

that has chosen to ignore them. _

black and homeless. Joseph has been homeless for
five years, having hitchhiked to Pittsburgh from
California in May of 1991. He had previously spent
four years in prison on charges of attempted
murder. but had been sentenced with assault with
a deadly weapon. '

It was a case of self-defense that made a-prisoner
out of the victim. According to.JoVseph,, someone
was trying to mug him, and in the midst of
defending himself, he was arrested.

During the course of his prison sentence his wife
filed for divorce. When Joseph Torres emerged a
free man, he was bankrupt with only God as his
guidance. Joseph holds no regrets for the actions
that landed him in prison because he was only
defending himself. Any human being in such a
situation would do the same.

But Joseph doesn’t carry weapons with him
anymore. He states, “I carry the power of the Lord,
and I know that what has happened has brought
me closer to the Lord.”

After arriving in Pittsburgh he tried to get a job,
but-in a recession, a job for even someone with a
place of residence is difficult. Although he was
scorned by local employers and generally by the
people around him, Joseph had only one other
alternative to make aliving. Begging for money is
not something he is proud of, but when fate throws
you a curve you don’t have much choice in the
matter.

He didn’t choose to be homeless. In fact Joseph
was a plumber in California earning $45,500 a year
before his life took a turn for the worse. He hopes .
that in his everyday dealings with people he
doesn’t offend anyone, but he feels that. people
should not try to ignore the homeless because the
homeless problem will not disappear. The
homeless are increasing as more opportunities for
many Americans slowly disappear. ..

Joseph Torres is a man who relies on the well-
being of others, and through his travels he has seen
many people, some more generous than others.

Two young men approach Joseph and ask him if
he needs food. One of the guys has a freshly

anything to just ask them. “The
nicest peoplefjare here in Pittsburgh," he claims. 
" When the students left for the summer months he

imissed them because they had become like a

family. They‘ had even sung the blues together.

Joseph said that “they don’t just give money, but»

they give their support. ,

The people aren’t obligated to give me money
everyday,” and in fact‘ on some days Joseph will
refuse money from his buddies because he feels
that they have given him what he needs most: They
show a definite interest in him. Wheneverthey see
him, their first question tends to be, “Did you eat
vet”.

Joseph also said, “There are lots of rude people,
but as a human being you need to overlook those

people.” He believes the Lord will always help out-

in some way or another, and those people who do"
help and care are giving Joseph Torres something
he hasn't had in a while -,— support. '

Joseph has gone to ' some shelters and soup
kitchens, but there are a lot of homeless, nonhygienic
people who go to the shelters, which are often
overcrowded. He generally sleeps outside to avoid
theft by other homeless persons.

First-year student Greg Muyer comes by to check
up onjoseph and see how he is doing and what his
plans for the night are. C

Most of Joseph's buddies are first-year students.

Susan Chapman and Dan Rutherford, both first-' '

year students, approach Joseph, and they hold an
informal group smoking session. Dan asks Joseph
whether the soap he had given him was OK. '

Cheaters never prosper Without a good scheme

Welcome back. Enjoy yourself. Don’t
worry about the problems" going on at this
university; they won’t affect you  much.

This guide will be particularly rewarding
for engineers, but occasional snippets

,may help the liberal arts major. Always

keep your eye open for shortcuts.

- Eventually they may help you somewhere.

A hint to all you new programmers:
Change variables, alter REM statements
and manipulate the numbering on those
program lines. That way no foreign-bom
teaching assistant will ever realize that you
didn’t do it yourself. Anyone can write a
program. It’s the ability to make an existing
program your own that bespeaks
intelligence.

Another quick tip to survival in the more
concentrated ﬁelds: Find an older student
fast, and kiss ass sufficiently. That way
they may be willing to pass down the
homework assignments they got last year

Joe Babinsack

and maybe even copies of the mid-terms.
Then just sit back, and at the last minute
apply similar methods as if it were a
program. It's a sure bet to get a passing
grade for doing as little as possible.

If you can’t hook up with an older
student, look to the nerdiest member of
your own class. Chances are that he or she
will be so overjoyed to find a friend that
you’ll be easily able to “work together” on
assignments. . _

An important note on test scores: Don't
worry about getting anything over 50 on
your exams. Those prefabricated
homework grades do wonders for your
overall average. Besides, no one can really
understand that garbage they want you to
explain on a one-hour test, and only a

super-genius can score over 

Test cheating etiquette: Never place
formulas or answers on desk tops
beforehand to avoid making your own
personal cheat sheet Chances are great
that someone more intelligent than you
will get to class early the day of thetest to
search for your stupidity.

Remember: All =-those people who
showed up for the first day of class will
return for a test, so don’t expect to be able
to know ‘where to sit, and most professors
are wise enough to place you a seat away
from anyone else, anyway. Now if you
know a smart person who happens to
write large, you're in luck, but don’t start
straining yourself without properly
warming up. A good grade is not worth a
stiff neck.

Take it from experience: Pencil on
calculator is most effective. It's easy to
wipe off before you get caught, but don’t

get too nervous too quickly and waste the
effort. The old pen-on-shoe works well,
but with fashionable shoes running close
to a hundred bucks a pop, leave this
method to the really rich kids, or buy some
K-mart specials just for the purpose.

Sucking up to the teacher is ﬁne. But
only if you’re taking advantage of a teacher
of the opposite sex. Don't get your peers
jealous in a way in which they will be
more likely to spread nasty rumors. '

Now that you have all the rules, you're
ready to get into the school year. Just find
out where that party is this weekend, and
have fun.

What? You find this lifestyle to be
unintelligent, conforming and a waste of
your time and money?

Welcome to the real world.

Pitt Cathedral to become first gothic parking lot

PI'I’I‘SBURGH— _

Students at the University of Pittsburgh
are seeking an injunction today to halt
National Development Corporation’s
proposal to raze the 62-year-old Cathedral
of Learning to make way for the world’s first
gothic-designed, 52-story parking facility. If
built, the structure will surpass Britain’s
elaborate 47-story Simoleon Place, the
world’s only Baroque-inspired parking

, arena.

“What we are trying to see realized here
are the efforts and ideas of Dr. Bowman,”
Timothy Scheister, chief legal counsel for
NDC, told a group of angry reporters this
morning in the non-smoking section of the

Cathedral's Roy Rogers. “His best, interests. :
_ are, to some disproportionate de'gree,,our_ _

best interests.” When asked to elaborate on
that comment, Scheister declined, “I have to
leave now  a luncheon is being held for
me today at the Med Center [sic]. And you
all know that I can’t be late for that."

The University of Pittsburgh's Medical
Center has come under fire in recent weeks

when it was discovered that _the Medical‘:
Center — or was it Presby? Who's who? —

(operating under the guise of NDC) outbid
its owner, the University of Pittsburgh, by
approximately $5 million for the right to

Ed,U. Cayshiin

raze the architecturally significant, one-of-
ia-kind, (almost) historical landmark, the
Syria Mosque. ,

Some university students and faculty

members had hoped that new Pitt President A

J. Dennis O’Connor would save the mosque,
renovate the structure and create a multi-
cultural center to promote the arts, but this
will not happen. Why? Because in the Land
of P02, where misappropriations — the

plural must always be emphasized -- and ;

$50,000 grocery bills are the norm, art is
reduced to craﬁiness! ~ I , I
, Sorry. Anyway, reached outside his
Squirrel Hill mansion, O’Connor appeared
in a good mood and was willing to dodge
questions about the Cathedral’s levelling.
“We're really excited about the whole
thing,” he told a group of foreign investors.
“Of course I’ll have first dibs on where to
park,and the university has assured me
that I’ll. get a new ofﬁce.”
Last week O’Connor was criticized by

‘The Pitt News for failing to disclose

information about his recent $82,000 ofﬁce

renovations. “I was assured by President

Posvar that there would be more than
enough money in this university’s budget
to pay for a redecoration of this kind. But
toshow the people of this community how
sincere I am, my wife and I have decided
to forego the Baccarat Crystal Tea Service
she so dearly wanted and are instead going
with that really neat Faberge Egg.”

Others were not so gleeful.

When he learned of ..this morning’s
developments, Student Council Interim
President Iam A. Weasel was outraged.
“For the university to erect an indoor
parking facility of this magnitude andto
not inform my office is one thing, but for
them to assume that the Student
Government Board’s president will be given
a parking space on the 49th ﬂoor and not
raise hell over it is utterly preposterous! My
administration will not stand for it!”

NEXT WEEK: Tensions ﬂare as a group
of activists calling themselves The
Committee to Save the Log Cabin initiates
a sit-in on the Cathedral lawn and disrupts
the $1,000-a-plate dinner and ribbon-cutting
ceremony.

Voter apathy deﬂates any eﬁ‘orts

Protesting is a time—honored
activity on college campuses
across the nation. Colleges and
universities were the places for
the best and most violent protests
of the '60s. The Persian Gulf crisis
and subsequent war brought the
students out again to protest An
article last week in The Pitt News

‘dealt with Pitt students in

opposition to the university’s
accepting research work from
the Department of Defense.
Vincent Eirene, a peace activist
who worked with Pitt students

: this past winter, is back again to

mobilize protestors. Some
students even got arrested while
blocking a door of a research
building doing work for the DOD
at Carnegie Mellon.

But while students are’

becoming quite proficient at
protesting in the streets, how are
they making their voices heard at
the polls? Americans were given
the privilege of choosing their
own rzi-presentation via the
Constitu iion and then were given
free speech in the Bill of Rights.

Once people: reach the legal
voting age, they are supposed to
participate in the election of our
public officials. At Pitt, all students
are eligible to vote in Student
Government Board elections, yet
only 6.6 percent of the student
population voted. In 1990, only
36.4 percent of the eligible
electorate voted in the general
elections in the United States.
What does this low turnout
mean? One idea that affects the
meaning of that number is the
participation of older people in
elections. Their deep concern
over issues such as Social Security
and Medicare will make them go
out and vote. A higher turnout
among older people lowers the
number of younger voters.
Therefore the gray vote is more
powerful than the green vote.
Another consideration involves
the protesting generation of the
'60s. A group that was so intent
on making a difference a little
over 20 years ago should bolster
the turnout rate as they enter
their early to mid-40s. But instead

Ed
Kichline

of voters increasing, they are
decreasing. The college students
of yesterday are not voting.

So why are today's students
doing the same? One reason is
that they are not registered. My
government teacher gave me a
form in high school, but I am sure
not all students are so fortunate.
In my first political science class
at Pitt, the teacher told us he does
not vote. Teachers of such subjects
might consider offering regis-
tration forms to students who
would be interested.

‘Some students are registered,
but it is back in their hometown.
When November comes, they
cannot be at home and probably

- do not think about an absentee

ballot. Absentee ballots can be
obtained from the home county’s
board of elections. 0

A better solution is to re-register

is a relief to see that those of the
younger generation are taking
the responsibility to help those
who were abandoned by an older

concerned about the city.
Should $100 million dollars be

Should Jim Ferlo and his friends

Pennsylvania needs the best
support at the national level in a
period when the state is
struggling. Also that one vote can

in the special election for the

Democrats. Former governor and
Attorney General

Republican side. '

Aside from the aforementioned
important issues, Thornburgh is
considered a candidate to run for
president in 1996 or later. This is
an important race for
Pennsylvania and deserves the
attention of students as well as all
voters. The nation will certainly
be watching, as it is the only
Senate race this~year.

Make this the year you become
an active voter. If you cannot
vote here, get an absentee ballot

for back home. If you are not “

registered, watch for registration
tables on campus. From
Pittsburgh to Harrisburg to

at the polls. If that does not work,
you could always form a protest.

Pitt munches the CM Tartans 1-0 in r

By Jason Billings
Stajf Writer

Pitt midﬁelder Nick Liberati ran
off the ﬁeld during a second—half
time-out and shouted for a drink
of water.

He was answered with a bottle
of water and 20 minutes of
continuous rain.

At the beginning of the game,
you could have asked any one of
the die-hard, rain-soaked fans
who they would have predicted
to win the game. The obvious,
but wrong, choice wouldhave
been Carnegie Mellon, as the Pitt
soccer team defeated CM, 1-0.

In the first 30 minutes of play,
the CM offense dominated Pitt’s
defense, playing its own

" defensemen at half field, pushing

Pitt’s cowering offense back into
their own territory. The Pitt
offense seemingly fell apart,
taking a few measly shots on the
Tartan goal. and ending up
playing more defense than
anything else. _

* Although the Tartans held the
ball in the Panthers’ territory for
more than 60 percent of the first
half, they only managed one shot
on _Pitt’s- goal, which Panther
keeper Tim Sobelman stopped
easily.

But with 15 minutes to play in
the half, Pitt’s gold—clad offense
started to come alive and turn
around a horrendous start

After a misplaced corner kick

that a CM defender promptly
ejected into a tree, Pitt midfielders
Eric Prex and JR. Perdue both
hefted shots to the Tartan
goaltender within minutes of each
other. This set the stage for a
beautiful attempt by #17 Don
Overmier that sent him careening
into the CM goalie. Only a single.
Tartan defenseman stopped

“Overmier ‘s kick from finding

nylon within five minutes of the
half.

The CM offense never saw a
break in the Panthers’ drive, as
yet another try on the Tartan
goalkeeper wassent wide. At the
half, the Panthers retired to the
bench with six shots on goal (four
of which were taken in the last 15
minutes) to the Tartans one.

Heinz Pak, assistant coach for
the Panthers, (said that the
Panthers’ aim. for the second half
was to keep the ball away from
the CM midfielders. “We had to
keep the ball wide to spread out
their defenders,” he said.

In fact, the Tartan midfield had
been most responsible for keeping
Pitt from scoring in the last few
minutes of the half.

“[CM] had already played two
scrimmages, and this was their
second game,” said Pak. “This
was our first. We hadn’t played
yet,~due to a new NCAA rule.“

The NCAA recently instigated a a
rule that doesn't allow its teams to H

play until Sept 7, the second
week of school at Pitt, said Pak

and be very complicated; however it is a good
idea to keep it basic so the elected “commissioner”
(who is responsible for organization) does not

have to spend his entire Monday buried in the

USA Today sports section.

.Here are scoring rules that are relatively basic,
but they’re complicated enough to make the
initial draft a challenge:

-6 points for a touchdown pass, touchdown
run, touchdown reception and touchdown return.

-3 points for a fieldgoal.

. 0 1 point for an extra point. , .

-6 points for 300 yards passing and another 6
points for every’ 100 yards after reaching 300. (If
Warren Moon Passes for 500 yards, it is worth 18
points.)

-6 points, for every 100 yards rushing or
receiving and another 6 points for every 100
yards after reaching 100. (If Thurman Thomas
rushes for 100 yards and receives for 100 yards

scoringmles, you conduct your draft. In many
ways it is similar to the actual NFL draft As
draftnik Mel Kiper says, “You don't want to
make ‘too many reaches.” Although if there is
someone you really want and you do not think
he will be available in the next round — take
him! There is nothing more painful than watching
someone you really wanted score megapoints
for your archrival. ‘ ' .

First, randomly select a draft order, but make
it fair. The person with the first pick gets the last
pick in the second round. The person with the
last pick in the first round picks first in the
second round, etc. Then you want to select
offensive skill position players like quarterbacks,
running backs, wide receivers, tight ends and
kickers. A draft should consist of 20 to 25 rounds.

A good breakdown of personnel in a 20 round
draft would be three quarterbacks, six running
backs, six wide receivers, three tight ends and
two kickers.

' You might want to draft four quarterbacks and
go with one less player at RB, WR or TE. A
starting lineup of one QB", two RBs, two WRs,
one TE and one K should be submitted to the
league commissioner by 1 p.m. every Sunday.
The owner with the most points wins.

Here are some draft day tips:

- Don’t reach: no tight end or kicker is worth I
a first- round pick or a second- round pick either.

-Keep bye weeks in mind, as entire divisions
have weeks off. You do not want a starting
lineup of QB Warren Moon, RB Barry Foster, RB
Kevin Mack, WR Eddie Brown, WR Ernest Givins,
TE Eric Green and K Gary Anderson. This would

On days when the sports world

seemingly comes to a halt,"

occasionally the writers and other
interested folk sit around talking
about events, real and fictitious.
Sometimes we think of the story
ideas or headlines that will have
the most impact, most of which
test reality as we know it.

And eventhough none of us
ever came up with the headline
“Tyson indicted of rape,” it isn’t

really surprising. Of all the

professional athletes I can think
of, Mike Tyson would be the
person I would think of first
when the words “violent crime”
and “athlete” are used in the

. same COIIICXI.

Of all the things that he has
done and said and all the things
that have been said about him,
the most surprising to me comes
from Don King. Through his
spokesman, King called the
indictment “unfortunate” and said
that Tyson will continue to train

for his fight against_Evander A

Holyﬁeld in November.

Now if it is determined that
Tyson is innocent of the charges,
then all this mess becomes
irrelevant to the public. But
judging from Tyson’s past, his

problems in dealing with women-

on a human level are very real

a chance to really defend himself.
Yet I know of no other
.professional athlete whose

socially deviant behavior has been
condoned or written off for so

long. Tyson is a menace — to V

other boxers, to women, to
himself. He must face some
consequence for his actions.

In the ring, Tyson fights one
man. It is one-on-one. He alone
is responsible for his fighting

victories and mistakes. Sure, a '
manager has something to do q

with the guidance of a boxer, but
once in the ring it is up to'the
fighter to realize that guidance. '
Tyson lacks accountability.
I imagine that Tyson likes to

win boxing matches. He has said  A

that he enjoys inﬂicting pain.
These two “hobbies”
compatible only to a point. Tyson
must not be rewarded for inﬂicting
pain on people other than those
with whom he has contractual

Personnel choices may set Steelers bozo/e

By Michael Milliron
Staﬂ“ Writer

The Pittsburgh Steelers had
personnel decisions to make at
the end of the preseason. They
may have made some bad ones.

  GVERNMEN T

Pittsburgh is not a Super Bowl-
caliber team in 1991, as last
Sunday’s game demonstrated.
They are still a team of the future,
with building blocks that could
see them dominate the NFL in the
mid—’90s.

A major problem’ has been the
Steelers’ inability to beat division
rivals Cincinnati and Houston. In
games against those teams, the
opposing offensive lines have
dominated the Steeler defensive
front. Defensive ends Keith Willis

. J Paul Diamond/The Pitt News
Barry Foster and the Pittsburgh offense have to get their act in gear if the Steelers are to be successful.

 STUDENT

and Donald Evans have been
literally manhandled. That is why
it is curious that they were kept
and defensive linemen Karl
Dunbar and Lorenzo Freeman
were waived. '

Dunbar was a second-year man
out of LSU whom defensive line
coachjoe Greene liked. Freeman
was one of the few Steelers who
could match up size wise against
Oiler and Bengal linemen. He
can also play all the defensive
line positions. Willis is a player
who had one great year in '83
and has been an average lineman
in the '80s, but now it is the '90s.
He is not getting any younger.
Evans was a second-round choice
by the Rams as a fullback, and by
no means has he found his niche
in the NFL as a defensive lineman.
Dumping the aging Willis would
shrink the payroll, something the
Steelers have been known for
trying to do.

Bryan Hinkle was not protected
under Plan B. He was approached
by the ’49ers and Jets with some
serious offers; however he was
loyal to the Steelers and remained
in Pittsburgh, which is

"commendable. The Steelers

should have told him he was not
in their future plans and to take,
the best offer. Do not get me
wrong, Hinkle has been a good
linebacker and still is. Jerrol
Williams, however, is a potentially
great linebacker who does not
get enough playing time due to
Hinkle.

Continuedfrom Page 14
in the NFL, but isn’t it about time
the Steelers learned how to play
the hot hand’ Didn't it make
sense to run more at a Bill defense

that gave up 144 yards to Mark)

Higgs of Miami, .who had 251

7 yards total in his three-year career

to that point? In addition, now
that Tim Worley is on ‘injured
reserve, isn’t it time to see if
Foster can be a consistent feature
back? Everything he has done so
far has shown that he can.

One thing that no one should
do is panic". This was one game
against a great team. Few people
realistically expected the Steelers
to beat the Bills anyway. The play
of the offense was encouraging
at times. Some point out that
Buffalo was minus Bruce Smith,
but one of the Steelers’ main
weapons, Eric Green, still seems
"to be having problems with a
knee injury he had in preseason.
The defense and the entire team
will rebound. Even if that doesn't
cheer anyone involved with the
Steelers up, remember this
weekend’s opponent: New
England. That is a team you can
getvery healthy against.

The team has talked about the

paramount importance of a quick '

start. How does 3-1 sound? It
seems to be within reachfwith

the Patriots visiting Three Rivers
this weekend and a trip to
Philadelphia to face the Eagles
minus Randall Cunningham to
follow. Philadelphia is no
girnmee, but it is the kind of
game the Steelers must start
winning if they are to have a
chance at the/playoffs.

-Yet again, many seem ready
to write'off Joe Montana now that
it seems he may need season-
ending surgery on his injured
right elbow.

Betting against Montana is like
walking through a bad part of
town with a big wad of money in
your hand; you might as well kiss
the cash and other things
goodbye. With Montana, the
’49ers can overcome their other
weaknesses to get back to the
Super Bowl. Without him, the
magic just isn’t there.

-New Giant Coach Ray
Handley didn’t take long to make
his first major rr1istake.. It was
wrong to start Jeff Hostetler over
Phil Simms at quarterback
because a starter should not lose
his job due to injury.

Simms is simply the _better‘
player. There is no way the Giants
should score only 13 points
against the very weak defense of
the Rams. -

Williams is an athletic 6-feet, S-inches and 244
pounds. His only detriment, according to coaches,
is an occasional coverage mistake. Mistakes are
worked out through playing time. Williams will
be the starting left outside linebacker within two
years anyway, so why not give him the experience
he needs now? Hinkle is not that effective on the

blitz, but Williams could be. At age 32, Hinkle is.

not getting any younger, and his departure
would shrink the payroll.

David Little made his first Pro Bowl last year
at inside linebacker, but do not think for a
minute that 1990 was his best year. His Pro-Bowl
berth was more for recognition that he has had
10 productive years in the trenches than for
outstanding, All-Pro level play. Little’s contract
was up, and he elected to hold out until after the
preseason. The Steelers should have_ traded him
to the Dolphins for a third—round pick in 1992.
Shula would love to have Little playing next to
Pro Bowler John Offerdahl.

Third-year man Jerry Olsavsky has started for
Little, who will ﬁnally be activated for the Patriot
game. Olsavsky, like Little, is undersized and is
an overachiever with great desire and instincts
for the game. The Steelers also wish to groom
first-rounder Huey Richardson for the right inside
linebacker position. Olsavsky is effective, a Noll
favorite and the present. Richardson is the future
Karl Mecklenburg of the Steelers. This all means
that Little has little to offer beyond this year, and
Olsavsky is unlikely to give way anyhow. _I.ittle’s
absence would also shrink the payroll" and give
the Steelers an opportunity to acquire future
talent in trade.

-On a different note, I really wonder what
kind of free safety Carnell Lake would make. He
is very intelligent and could become quite adept

at reading quarterbacks. He_is very fast (running '
4.4-40s), big (6-1, 207 pounds) and athletic. Lake

could wreak havoc with a little more freedom
roaming the field. Thomas Everett is a good free
safety but would be better suited to nickelback
since his size (5-9, 180 pounds) seldom allows
him to play an entire season injury free. Everett
would take less pounding as a nickelback.

At strong safety, the Steelers could use the
promising Gary Jones when he returns from
injury or Delton Hall when he, too, returns from
injury. Yes, I know Hall is a corner, but his style
of play indicates that he would make a better
strong safety. Hall is big — 6-1, 208 pounds —

and loves to hit and mix it up. His man coverage

suffers because he cannot turn and burn when
a receiver goes deep. - .e cannot swivel his hips
quickly enough and lacks recovery speed. When
the play is in front of Hall, he makes opponents
P33’-

-It would be nice to see Pitt -fans out in force
this weekend at the Temple game. The officious
Owls have beaten the Panthers three out of the
last five years at Pitt Stadium. Not good. Last
yearl went to the Temple game by myself, as
virtually everyone I knew refused to go, but I
went ,with my Pitt No. 99 jersey (Hugh Green)
and binoculars to watch the action more closely.
Not good. I wound up sporting the Don Coryell
look of perpetual gas, as the Panthers lost both
the game and a brawl that broke out.

I’m looking for changes this year. It would be
nice to hear a lot of noise coming from the
student section. Let’s heckle Temple. I would
like to see the Owls’ third-string QB this week,
with No. 92 Keith Hamilton taking out the ﬁrst-
stringer, Trent Thompson, and No. 91 Sean
Gilbert taking out the second-stringer, Anthony
