Double Feature Movie
Is Named ‘Fate Worse
Than Death’ By Writer

OFFICIAL STUDENT TRLVVEEKLY PUBLICATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

 

By S. SIDNEY KALWARY

“A fate worse than death-
sitting through a double feature
twice,” jokes Mark Hellinger.
Read this twice and you begin
to see a serious side to scribe
Hellinger’s gag. Double ﬁlm
bills are a menace.

Not only do the bargain bills
hurt the moviegoers’ health and
bring down the cinema standards
(standards, incidentally, that we
have fought for), but they com-
pletely annihilate our aesthetic
sense.

We are growing less and less
satisﬁed to just sit and watch one
good production. The majority of
us are being conditioned to enjoy
only bills with two ful1—length
features—almost always trashy—
and several side dishes of cheap
comedy.

Can you visualize the glorious
Disney creation, “Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs,” on the same
program with some inane love tri-
angle? If you can, you should be
made to sit through it——and with-
out a Mickey Mouse cartoon, tool

Acid Analysis

Let’s analyize a typical double
feature: “She’s Got Everything”
and “Bulldog Drummond’s Re-
venge” and some sort of a musical
comedy short. The latter is too
poor to even warrant inspection.
The title of the ﬁrst flicker marks
it. Technically and logically, no
one has everything, least of all the
female lead, Ann Sothern.

The male lead is the pretty,
golden-haired Gene Raymond,
who always reminds me of a bot-
tle of milk-—he’s so irritatingly
healthy. In this ﬂimsie, Raymond
bobs around very big and author-
itatively, making grand gestures
of love to a spoiled, rich girl, sud-
denly become poor. He’s the boss
-—lousy rich, of course—and she’s
the working girl-—just lousy.

Miss Sothern runs the gamut of
a bobby-pin in love. She pouts,
spouts and spurns. Raymond
reverses the order. He spurns,
spouts and pouts! It’s a wonder
that the odor of these alleged
characterizations don’t crack up
the sound machine. The story is
as weak as an end that has been
blocked out all afternoon by a
Sutherland-coached eleven. “She’s
Got Everything” hasn’t got any-
thing!

Mudclled Picture

Occasionally the “Bulldog
Drummond” pieces are interesting.
But “Bulldog Drummond’s Re-
venge” is not one of them. There’s
not even a little hint anywhere in
the muddled plot about Drum-
mond’s or anybody else’s re-
venge. Captain Drummond, en-
acted by a good-looking chap
whose name escapes my memory
just now, does a fair job with a
pitiful part.

John Barrymore, still coming
back, plays an English police big-
wiggle who does nothing but as-
sume poses and utter crisp orders.
The Captain’s heart interest, Lou-
ise Campbell, screams four times
and faints twice. This was sup-
posed to be Miss Campbell’s big
chance. Somebody’s fooling the
young lady.

Hero Drummond has the uncan-
ny knack of tripping into and over
all kinds of mysteries. The ine-
vitable clues all trip and fall over
him. He could easily be an inval-
uable policeman on the “get-your-
man” force of every nation in the
world at the same time! The re-
venge angle must be mixed up
somewhere in the audience. For
the customers take an awful lac-
ing.

Double features, well, Helling-
er has the right idea. But it’s not
funny. It’s tragic. Double-bills
are killing what the movie pro-
ducers have strived for since Al
Jolson’s history making talkie——

intelligent entertainment — “The
Great Ziegfeld,” “Emile Zola,”
“Snow White and the Seven

Dwarfs.” This is the standard we
want maintained.

‘Pickets, Please’

To Use Scenery
From Gordon Hit

There may be a business re-
cession right now throughout
the country, but it isn’t' going
to affect, Cap and Gown’s
“Pickets, Please.”

According to James Lindsay
technical director of the all
male musical comedy, this
year’s production, which will be
presented during the week of
April 4 at the Nixon theater, will
have more lavish and brilliant
scenery than any show in the his-
tory of the organization.

Lindsay returned recently from
New York, where he secured the
scenery from Max Gordon, pro-
ducer of many of Broadway’s
greatest hits. Mr. Gordon has
'givcn outright to the University
the scenery from two of his mu-
sicals, “The Great Waltz” and
“Save Me The Waltz.”

BALCONY SCENE

This scenery, which is valued
at $125,000, will be adapted and
done over for “Pickets, Please!”
according to Lindsay.

When the curtain goes up open-
ing night, the audience will see a
balcony towering 12 feet above
the stage against a black drape.
On each side of the stage will be
a tall lamp post.

Scene 2 takes place in the dic-
tator’s office, and this set will have
large French windows in the
background.

In the last scene, which is in a
ballroom, the stage will be elevat-
ed in the rear. Cellophane chand-
eliers and huge columns will
bring Act I to a “dazzling” ﬁnale.

TWO BALLROOMS

The ilI‘St scene of Act II is in
the League of Nation’s conference
chamber and will be elevated 24
feet. The decorations will be in
red “to suggest the idea of pow-
er,” says Lindsay.

For the next scene, which is in
the palace gardens,- green velour
and “teddy bear” cloth drapes with
many garden cut-outs will com-
pose the design of this exterior.

The ﬁnale takes place in a grand
ballroom, and will be entirely dif-
ferent from the first ballroom set.
The main feature of this set will
be two huge windows surmounted
with five-foot carved wooden
eagles.

Group Achieves

High Average

Scholarship ratings for men’s
social fraternities during the
ﬁrst semester of this school
year show a slight‘ increase
over the same period last year,
it was revealed today by Rob-
ert R. Corley, assistant. dean
of men and faculty adviser to fra-
ternities.

Figures released by Mr. Corley
show that not only are the aver-
ages higher last year than the
first semester, but the all-frater-
nity average is higher than for
any first semester since 1933-34.

Compiled for the 13 fraternities
in lnterfraternity Council, the all-
fraternity quality point average
during the first semester reached
1.375. The nearest approach to
this ﬁgure during a ﬁrst semester
is the 1.'134 earned by the same
group during the same period last
year. This ﬁgure was 1.18 the
ﬁrst year, according to the records
in Mr. Corley’s oﬁ'ice.

AVERAGES HIGHER

The lowest individual house av-
erage has advanced from 1.05 last
year to 1.10 this year. This ﬁgure
has also steadily increased from
.48 for the first semester of the
ﬁrst recorded year. _

Highest quality point average
this year was 1.68, an increase
from 1.09 last year, ﬁrst semes-
ter. The 1933-34 ﬁrst semester
average for the leading fraternity
was 1.516, which ﬁgure has risen
fairly steadily to this year’s ﬁgure.
The ﬁrst semester of 1935-36, Phi
Epsilon .Pi.. far .9s..1ei.stas.ced the
other houses with an unusual av-
erage of 1.94.

PI LAMBS TOPS

Individual honors among the 13
men’s social fraternities on the

campus go to’Pi" Lambda Phi with‘

1.68. Second was Sigma Alpha
Mu with 1.66; and third, Alpha
Phi Alpha with 1.59.

Greatest individual increase
during a year was also made by
the winners who came from fourth
position last year. Only four

Four hundred and eight men
and 83 women, an amazing total
of 491 students, had taken the
free Tuberculin test at the end
of the first three-day week.

Proportionately, this figure is
much higher than the number
taking the Wassermann tests last
fall. At the end of the first week,
a five-day week, 567 students and
faculty members had taken the
Wassermann. At the present rate,

“Whereas, the Student Health

ord as heartily endorsing the
efforts of the Student Health

solved that each member of the
Assembly actively support the

Luziroeitz Reports To Peace

Group On. Washington Journey

Pitt Peace Council’s
Wednesday featured a report of
the recent American Youth Con-
gress’ pilrimage to Washington.

Joseph Lazirovitz, E41, the
Council’s delegate, stressed the is-
sue of civil liberties; told of flag-
tant discrimination against Negro
delegates, who were refused the
services, of “white” hotels and
restaurants; of the Negro slums,
a stone’s throw from the Capitol.

He was particularly encouraged
by the enthusiastic reception the
delegates received from the Presi-
and Senators O’Con—nor,
Barnard and La Follette. He de-
scribed the assembly as an “en-
thusiastic, but well-mannered and
orderly” group.

Lazirovitz also stressed the fact
that the pilgrimage centered

meeting ¢

}around “jobs and education,” that
peace was only indirectly a part
of the Congress’ activity.

Before Lazorovitz’s report, plans
for the April Peace Strike and es-
tablishment of a speaker’s bureau
were discussed. It was decided
that the Speaker’s bureau, and the
coming Intercollegiate Peace con-
ference to be held March 26, at
Carnegie Tech, be used to arouse
interest in the Peace Strike among
students and student organizations.
Committees were appointed to
plan a campaign to raise funds
and increase membership of Pitt
Peace Council. Committee mem-
bers were Rosemary Lutz, C39;
Bernard McKenna, C39; Laziro-
vitz, Jean Wald, C40; and Mar-
cella Grekin, C38.

Petitions are also available to-

Both CA and Men’s Council pe-
titions must be returned by
April 1.

After an extended discussion of
the advisability of holding a sep-
arate Senior Ball, assembly mem-
bers unanimously went on record
in favor of combining the Spring
Festival dance and Senior Ball.

Chief factor which inﬂuenced
the decision was the fact that the
Senior Ball has never been a suc-
cessful dance. Figures presented
by Theodore W. Biddle, assistant
dean of men, showed that nine of
the last ten Senior dances have
lost zoney.

Under the schedule decided up-
on by the assembly, the combined
Senior Ball—Spring Festival dance
will be held Friday, May 6.

SPRING FESTIVAL

This arrangement is necessitated
by the fact that Cap and Gown is
playing the week of April 4. The
Spring Festival committee hopes
to hold the festivities May 4, 5.
and 6, instead of during the pre-

ceding week, as scheduled in The

Compass, explained Mr. Biddle.

University assemblies will be
held once each month next year
if plans of the Special Assemblies
committee, headed by John Baker,
BA38, materialize. As explained
by Kairys, the assembly program
will include one meeting on ﬁne
arts appreciation and another at
which all University musical or-
ganizations will appear.

Centralization of the University
social program for next year, with
the SFA Executive Committee se-
lecting dates and halls for all
dances, was proposed by Rose. At
the first executive committee
meeting of the year. plans for the
social program would be prepared,
and the dean of men’s oiﬁce em-
powered to engage halls for the
dances.

almost certainly pass the 2,000

!test is simpler and locally more
important than the Wassermanns.”

Tuberc-ulin tests are being of-

ject is being carried on with the
cooperation of the student health
services and The Pitt News.

Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, di-

women’s participation in the Tu-
berculin tests, “The women of the
University are cooperating in a
grand manner with this important
project. Eighty--three women took
the test in the first two days, and
we have appointments all through
next week.

“However, it is not necessary
ifor the women to make appoint-

ments. If they will just come into

our offices on the eighth floor of

ple that it can be administered
immediately.”

Local Business

Shows Gain

Despite a moderate gain in in-
dustrial production, business in
the Pittsburgh district averaged
slightly lower in February than
in January, according to the Uni-
versity Bureau of Business Re-
search.

The decrease in the level of
business here was due partly to a
shrinkage in originating freight
shipments and partly to a smaller
volume of trade. Although busi-
ness receded throughout the
greater part of February, the rate
of decrease was considerably slow-
er than it was in January, and the
drop in January was far slower
than it was in December.

The Bureau’s seasonally ad-
justed index of business was 67.6
per cent of the 1923-25 average in
February; it was 68.8 per cent in
January, and 71.4 per cent in De-
cember, 1937. One year ago this
index stood at 123.3 per cent.

“What cigarette

do the tobacco.

HERE'S MISS REED’S ANSWER: “Yes,
I certainly bczve. Camels are different in
so many ways. Going through my stunts
over and over is a severe test of healthy
nerves. I smoke Camels all through the
day, and my nerves don’t feel the least
bit frayed. Being so mild, Camels are
gentle to my throat too. After a meal,
I enjoy Camels —‘for digestion’s sake.’
You see—in so many ways, Camels
agree with me.”

I-"OR REGREATSON Miss Reed
likes cooking . . . dancing . . .out-
door sports. And Camels! “Hol-
lywood seems to prefer Cam-
els,” she says. “I notice so many
of the stars smoking them.”

IONE REED, Hollywood stunt girl, after
a hazardous feat, asked for a Camel.
And that led to the question: “Do you
have deﬁnite reasons for preferring
Camels to other cigarettes, Miss Reed?”

DARING? Yes! Foolhardy? No! Ione Reed knows w/mt she’:
doing. And she smokes Camels, because, as she says: “It
means a lot to me to know that my cigarette agrees with me!”

Millions of other people find
that camels give them what they want in smoking!

Men and women in all walks of life say: “Camels agree
with -me!” If you are not now enjoying Camels, perhaps
you, too, will find as others have, that it means a lot to
smoke Camels—the cigarette that is made from ﬁner,
MORE EXPENSIVE TOBACCOS, Turkish and Domestic.

tive. "I know what hard work
is,” Miss Reed says. "Many a.
time I’m thankful for the ‘lift’
I get with a Camel.”

“camels — by a large

of tobacco bought by
each popular cigarette

T. N. Williams,
well-known grow-
er, of Winchester, .,
Kentucky, says:
“A planter knows
tobacco. My last
crop was the best
I ever had and the Camel people
bought my best leaf tobacco. There
isn’t any question where the more
expensive tobaccos go. They're in
Camel c'iga.rettes.”

bought the best

last crop. Paid a high price for my
ﬁnest grades. I smoke Camels-
because I know there isn’t any
substitute for more expensive to-
baccos.” -

 

Top prices, that’s
what J. B. Jackson,
successful planter,
got from the Camel
buyer last year.
“Camel buyers don’t
buy just any tobacco *'~
—they pay more to get the best.
That means ﬁner tobaccos are
used for Camels. I say quality has
got to be grown in tobacco. That's
why I smoke Camels.”

Worth Unknown

Furthermore, the wash-tubbing
of the Pitt athletic situation is an
event that has gained consider-
able public cognizance. There was,
on the surface, a tieup between
the Schwartz evacuation and the
“Code Bowman” inauguration.

These were the points that ap-
pealed to the downtown sports-
writers, and accordingly they
seized the event. Now let us get
down to the basics, let us examine
the situation in its objective real-
ity.

Schwartz, on the basis of his
performance on Mike Milligan‘s
freshman squad, was nothing
more than a good ball-player
who learned the Pitt system as a
blocking quarterback. Of course,
no judgment can be passed on his
respective gridiron attributes from
the exposure to the collegiate
game that he had as a freshman.

Lenny Schwartz decided to re-
linquish his college opportunities
for solely one reason. The imme-
diate results of being in business
had more allure for him than the
long-run campus experiences. And
whether this is a sensible attitude
or not is distinctly a relative mat-
ter. There is substantiation for the
arguments on both sides. ‘Suffice
it to say that Mr. Schwartz has
been doing rather well in a ﬁnan-
cial way, at this early moment
with his business venture in

neighboring Charleroi.
=3 =1‘ =16

Not Retroactive

The point that should be cleared
is that Schwartz was not dissatis-
ﬁed with his treatment here, that
there is no connection between
his action and the new athletic
rulings. Schwartz entered school
last February and did not come
under the “broom and window-
washing” phases of the “Hagan
Plan.”

He regretted giving up the op--
portunity of playing football un-
der Sutherland, but he only gave
that up so that he could get off to
a start immediately in the busi-

ness world.

‘WARGO FAVORED

The 125-pound class will see a
new champion, and he probably
will be John Wargo, sensational
Pitt star. Vvargo had cleaned up
all opposition until ‘last week’s
Bucknell match, when he was the

'victim of a slightly questionable

decision.

Captain Caruso of Pitt holds
the position of favorite in the 135-

Pitt Swimmers
Meet Buckeyes

Pitt’s undefeated swimming
team faces its stiffest assignment
when it entertains the visiting
Ohio State natators next Tuesday
evening in the Metropolitan pool.

The Ohio State team is generally
considered the strongest swim
outﬁt in the country. They mer-
ited such consideration by way of
their victory over Michigan. To
prove their superiority the Staters
repeated their win over Michigan.
Earlier in the season Michigan
had dunked the hitherto undunk-
ed Yale team, which ‘ates as one
of the best in the East.

All of this team beat that team
which beat the other team adds
up to the conclusion that Ohio
State has a very powerful swim
team. A win over them means a
strong claim on the national win
title for Pitt.

Thus far the Pitt team has
ducked every opponent. That Ohio
State will fall into this same cate-
gory is doubtful — very doubtful.
But then Pitt has some swimmers
that are capable of matching
doing a good bit of very efficient
swimming.

Johnny Has A Record |

By KEN

RYDEN

Once more Johnny \Voodruff's name pops up on the inter-

national track and ﬁeld front.

This time as a member of the

world record holding American two-mile and 3,200 metres relay

team.

In a recent meeting in Paris, the International Amateur
Athletic Federation rewrote the track and ﬁeld record books.

This was their ﬁrst meeting since‘v‘

just before 1936 Olympics, and
their decisions were eagerly
awaited.

Pitt’s long striding Olympian

lay team composed of Chuck,

Robert Young,
a n d H a r r y
W i ll i amson.
The race was

an exhibition!
taken by mem-
b ers of the
American con-
t i n g e n t o f
track and ﬁeld
s t a r s . T h e
accredited record is 7 :35.8.

 

Previous to this meet Woodrulf
had won the Olympic 800 metre
run which gained him the respon-
sible position as anchor man on
the “world’s fastest two-mile re-
lay team.”

Notable in reviewing the deci-
sions of the Federation is the
dominance of American names on
the record list. Only three Euro-
peans were honored with their
names on the list.

MILE RELAY ENTRY

Frank Ohl, Al Ferrara, Al Mc-

Bayzk, Pete Bennet, Ben Kopec
and Ed Routch will make up the
Panther contingent. The squad
will concentrate on the relays, en-
tering teams in the mile and med-
ley relay.

Frank Ohl, Al Ferrara, Al Mc-
Kee and Johnny Woodruff will
try for their third successive mile
relay Victory. This time their
chief heckler is the speedy quartet
of baton wielders from Ohio State.

The Ohio Staters have turned
in a time of 3.20 and 7-10 second
while the best Pitt time is 3.21 and
5-10. Somewhere along the line
one of the Pitt men will have to
drop a second unless Ohio State
cooperates by running a full sec-
ond slower. Meanwhile this dif-
ference of 8-10 seconds is making
Olson spend a lot of time worry-

around the odd distance of 9/2;
miles and hand the stick to Ben

Johnny Woodruﬁ is not entered
in any other event and will con-
centrate on the relays. Johnny
Bayzk, who seems to edge up
nearer with every meet, will enter

Daddio, Chick, Mark, and com-

in the game. The Thetas ran this
lead up to 20-5 at half time as

Melvyn scored freely.

Kappa Sigma, lead by Johnny
Micheloson, played a better game
of ball the second half but could
not keep pace with the Theta Chi
quintet. The third quarter end-
ed, 32-11. g

In the fourth quarter, “Mike”
made ﬁve points to head his team
in outscoring the victors, 9-5.

Theta Chi outscored last year’s
champs 15 to 9 from the ﬁeld and
7 out of 12 to 2 out of 6 from the
free throw line.

TRIPLE TIE

Chickerneo and Vernallis led
the victors with 9 points each
and Micheloson’s 7 points topped
the scoring for the Kappa Sigs.

From this corner it looks like
the Theta Chi’s will succeed the
Kappa Sigs as Interfraternity
champs. However, the SAE’s are
still to be reckoned with. Little
hope is held for them, however,
in the playoffs for the League B
championship, starting this Mon-
day night at the Stadium. The
Kappa Sigs should defeat SAE
and drop their second decision to
Theta Chi in the playoff. Theta
Chi will win both games and SAE

Jock To Continue
Teaching At University

LTHOUG-l-I a. bit late, these Words of con-
gratulations to Dr. John Bain Suther-
land, head football mentor, anent his recent
statement that he will not be a Republican
candidate for the position of Lieutenant Gov-
ernor, are still in order-

It still seems to us that the Republican gen-
tlemen took several things into consideration
when they asked Jock to become a candidate,
but the most important thing to them was
their party ’s opportunity for gains in the
for-thcomiiig election at the expense of Dr.
Sutherland.

'\'\'e believe that Jock did well by refusing
to lend his popular appeal to a cause which
would take him from the football ﬁeld where
his coaching is recognized as second to none
in the nation. \Ve commend his stand and
hope that he will be here to coach the Pan-
thers for many years to come.

Well...

Letters
Editor, The Pitt News:

The Chancellor has indicated by his speech given
in Memorial Hall that he intended the Commons
Room to be used as a “meeting place” for the stu-
dents. I am sure that we agree with Dr. Bowman,
but one thing is lacking.

 

We often get absorbed in friendly conversation-

and we don’t notice the time; as a result, we are
often late for class. I am sure that the sounding of
the chimes in the Commons Room would do much
to make it serve its intended purpose.

If the chimes were of the old, harsh, clanging

variety, I would hestitate to advocate this, but the;

soft, dulcet tones of the Cathedral chimes would
not mar the dignity of the Commons Room.

MILTON HOFFMAN, BA40.

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am quite surprised to observe in a recent issue
of The Pitt News that the Pitt Chess Club is peti-
tioning for a charter. As a former member of the
Pitt Chess Club and its secretary during the school
year of 1934-35, I am shocked and pained to hear
that they must, at this late date, petition for a char-
ter.

In the good old days (1932 and before) the chess
team was one of the most successful on the Uni-
versity’s list of competitive activities. VVe have
beaten Army as often and consistently as has the
football team to mention nothing of having fre-
quently made hash of other smaller fry in this
vicinity. I even remember that on one occasion we
syamped the then powerful Pittsburgh Chess Club
5 to O.

The University used, in those days, to send the
team to New York each Christmas to play in the
intercollegiate chess matches and, although our
boys usually suffered from the inconveniences oc-
casioned by their meagre budget, they acquitted
themselves nobly. Following the school year of
1932-3 the University was forced by adverse eco-
nomic conditions to withdraw their ﬁnancial sup-
port from the oldest of all games and the Chess

Club existed in only a haphazard manner for the
next two years.
In 1935 an energetic group of chess players in

the Pittsburgh district formed the Greater Pitts-
burgh Chess League and the University was repre-
sented by a team composed of Roger Ilsley, Chem.
 Sidney Magram, Chem. Sp. ’37; Leonard Hepner,
Chem. Sp. ’37; H. Sacks, C’37; and myself.

At that time Mr. Hepner and I called on the dean
of men’s office to verify our position as an ac-
credited activity and we were assured that we were
in good standing. The following year (I had grad-
uated and was not actively concerned) I believe
that the Pitt team won the Greater Pittsburgh
championship.

In view of these things and especially in con-
sideration of the fact that the Pitt Chess Club al-
ways has been a regular Pitt activity I fail to see
why they should now have to petition SFA for a
charter. In 1935 I was personally assured that our
charter was on ﬁle and no doubt a search will re-
veal it.

I hope that this letter has helped to throw some
light on the situation and I wish further to take
advantage of this opportunity to offer my services
to the club if I can possibly be of any help. I oﬁer
my best regards to you, Mr. Editor, and I sincere
hope that there will be no “Horse” play with the
“Game of Kings.”

OVCI‘

By Clarence Wible '

I noticed in the newspapers the other day that :1
general had designed a uniform. for himself. He
was highest in command, and this was his prero-
gative. Those who saw the newly-designed uniform
labeled it, “impressive and distinctive.”

Included in the makeup of the uniform was a
bright canary-yellow sash. This caught the eye of
everyone who viewed the uniform, and all com-
mented very favorably on the yellow sash.

The general must look very handsome in his new
uniform. He may possibly appear before Congress
and tell Congress that what this country needs is
a bigger and better army. The good old army was
always better than the navy.

Which is only a round-about way of saying once
more that there is something irresistable about a
uniform, something thatdeceives people into be-
lieving what they don’t want to believe about the
army and war. There must be something to this
old idea about the remote appeal of a uniform, be-
cause, again in the newspapers, I noticed that :1
ﬁfteen-year-old boy had enlisted in a Scottish regi-
ment, noted fo" their ﬂashy uniforms.

A Scottish Volunteer

The caption under the picture of the boy in his
regiment uniform stated that the regiment had ac-
cepted the boy because the army was very badly
in need of volunteers. In a more somber note, the
caption also read that the boy was to leave Glasgow
for Singapore, and that no one knew when he would
return to Scotland. No, I suppose that no one does.

In Italy, Germany, and Austria, we read of Black
Shirts, Brown Shirts, Mussolini’s uniformed Cubs,
Hitler's Vvolves with their toy riﬁes and sabers; of
swastikas, upraised arms, salutes, militaristic mum-
bo-jumbo, ritual, and badges. All the stinking rot-
ten ritualism of the army is paraded before the
eyes of the impressionable young of these nations.
Even the military maneuvers of war are gloriﬁed,
as we read of Mussolini’s son Bruno describing the
beauty of bombs bursting over the peaceful Ethi-
opian countryside.

And now in our own country we have the Junior
Legion, comprised of the sons whose fathers are
members of the American Legion. Their fathers
have equipped them with guns, and swords, and
bugles, and they parade around just like their
daddies did when they were “Over There.” And,
oh yes, they have nice uniforms too.

Ritualism And War

Many object strenuously to the ritual of the
church. They claim that it misleads the people.
But when we strip the ritual from the church, we
will ﬁnd a fundamental good which few deny.
Strip the ritual from the army, and we ﬁnd a body
of men who are marching away to kill and be
killed,

So, let’s forget the glory and color of the army
if we can. It is this wanton display of color and
glory that is and has been the heritage of armies
of all time, that is one of the real obstacles to clear
thinking on the subject of war.

Once we get over our natural susceptibility to
flashy uniforms, army bands, and army ritual, we
will have taken a deﬁnite step towards the eradi-
cation of war hysteria that inevitably claims even

the most sensible in times of war.

Modern Dance Music
Adopts Speciﬁc Detail

By Robert Brown

Uinversity dance-goers in general, and English majors and

professors in particular, will be

pleased t'o know that the spe-

ciﬁc detail is at last ﬁnding its way into modern dance music.
One cannot blame Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, and coin-

pany for waiting so long to put this literary clincher to their

lyrics. Literature is very old, but modern dance music did not

begin until Johann Sebastian Bach’
stepped up some of his bourecs
for dancing on the village green.
As yet, swing musicians and lyric-
ists have not put any phrase into
their music comparable to James
Joyce’s “snot-green sea,” but one
must give them time.
‘THANKS FOR MEMORY’

For example, look at the lead-
ing number on the Hit Parade.
“Thanks for the Memory” is the
catch line to bring back blissful
recollections to the unhappy lover.
“Thanks for‘ the memory of

rainy afternoons,

Swingy Harlem times,

And mot-or trips and burning
lips and burning toast and
prunes.”

Even the little dwarfs in “Snow 1

White” contribute to the newf

trend, when one of them sings:

“The minute I was born I didn’t 

have a. nightie, f
So I tied my whiskers round I
my legs

And used them for a didie.” 

All of this harangue is not writ- !

ten to decry the excellence of the 
old standards--“Stardust;” “Sweet E
Sue;” “Blue Skies,” etc. Moderni
lyricists have not yet coined a;
verb as good as “idalize,” that isi

'ing a change of heart.

Kline ticket
ggulls circling around the Ile de

used in “Ida, Sweet as Apple
Cider.” But the words to the old
tunes are so horrible that they are
never sung any more.

Even the tangoes are experienc-
“Mamma
Bong,” a recent addition to the
literature of this dance form, is so
hot that she “cannot sit still on
her patio.” In addition, she can
make fellows follow in her wake
from Brazil to Hong Kong‘.

‘FOOLISII THINGS’

From the viewpoint of the spe_
ciﬁc detail, the number “These
Foolish Things” should win some-
thing or other. “A cigarette that
leaves a lipstick’s traces; an air-
to romantic places;

France”——these are a few of the
reasons that this piece hit the top
in the nation’s favor before it was
succeeded by the two month’s run
of “Did I Remember?”

One positive result of this in-
fluence of the speciﬁc detail is that
it saves us from listening to such
things as the ubiquitous, “A Star
Fell Out of Heaven,” when it is
sung by such people as Curly
Stebbins and Helen Morgan. Cur-
ly Stebbins is OK, but Helen Mor-
can. . . . Well, anyway . . .

Harry Baur

Portrays

;Musician’s Life, Loves

Beethoven’s Compositions Form Background

For Story Of Poverty,

Heartbreak, Genius

By Estelle Kovacs

A symphony within a syinphony aptly describes the French-

niade ﬁlm, “Life and Loves of Beethoven,

at the Art Cinema.

77

currently showing

Harry Baur in the titular role is the dynamic and stormy

main theme in this photographic fantasia.

He outshines the

minor themes of the
Juliette, his life-long love, and the
Countess von Brunswick, the wo-
man who unrequitedly devotes
her life to the musician.

MUSICAL BACKGROUND

The pathetic story of poverty,
heartbreak, and genius that was
Beethoven’s life is artistically un-
rolled with a background of ex-
quisitely executed Beethoven mu-
sic. The picture plays up, right-
fully, Beethoven as the musician,
the erratic composer of the im-
mortal Fifth symphony, the Apas—
sionata, the Eroica, the Moon-
light Sonata—all faithfully repro-
duced as foil for the dramatic ac-
tion of the story itself.

Harry Baur as Beethoven shows
himself the master of pantomime
acting. Overlooking the language
handicap, the dialogue is in
French, the spectator is taken im-
mediately with the genuineness
of his portrayal of the immortal
musician.

OUTSTANDING SCENE

Outstanding is the scene where
Beethoven suffers his greatest
blow, the loss of his hearing. Viv-
idly executed, the audience is per-
mitted to enter Beethoven’s mind,
to hear the sounds that ﬁlled his
head prior to the great silence that
never lifted.

Probably the most dramatic
scenein the picture is the compo-
sition of the famous “Apassion-
ata.” Beethoven, with the renun-
ciation of Juliette, has retired to

STOP and (30

By Nick Spanos

Take it from me, you’ll get over
any mad you might have had with
the Fulton or with Universal or
Herbert Marshall or Gail Patrick
or even Deanna Durbin when you
see “Mad About Music,” by far
and away the best in Miss Dur-
bin’s short list of triumphs. It is
the cat’s pajamas, as they say at
the Delt house. 

There is nothing sparklingly
new about the picture and yet it
manages to be entertaining and
thoroughly so for two hours. The
story is the same used in the ill-
starred Bobby Breen opus, “Make
a Wish,” and it seems to know its
way around pretty well by this
time.

Deanna is the daughter of
Gwenn Taylor, at the moment
Hollywood’s leading combination
of amour and glamour. For rea-
sons, obvious even to your cor-
respondent, Gwenn could not very
well run around having cocktails
with casting directors with a 14-
year—old daughter on her hands.
And so poor Deanna is hidden
away in a Swiss girls’ school.

Here she develops a strange
complex which takes the form of
fantasies composed about the ﬁg--
ure of a non—existent explorer-
father. To back up her tales De-
anna writes letters to herself, sup-
posedly from her father and in
them she elaborates on his work
in the jungles. Unfortunately, one
of her classmates is a veritable
little witch, i.f you know what I
mean, and she pooh-poohs all of
Deanna’s stories.

Finally, to cap it all, Deanna
is cornered into having to produce
some sort of ancestry, in the ﬂesh.
The ancestry turns out quite hap-
oily to be Herbert Marshall and
his man, "Arthur Treacher. After
a few quite humorous complica-
tions and a song or so from De-
anna everything turns out just as
vou hoped it would.

the seclusion of an old water-mill,
where he lives as a recluse. In a
ﬂash of thunder and lightning, he
is inspired to write the “Apassion-
ata.” We get music interspersed
with thunder and lightning, the
whole effect producing a scene of
unimagined emotional height.

To the heart-rending strains of
the “Miserere,” Beethoven’s life, a
life of poverty intermingled with
genius, of suffering and untold
emotional crises, ends.
