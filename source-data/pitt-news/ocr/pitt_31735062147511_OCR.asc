Men’s New Rush
Season To Start
This Wednesday

Semi-Annual Social Events’ Whirl
Preceding Pledging Will End
2 O’Clock Sunday Morning

Fraternity rushing starts again
I/Vednesday.

With the beginning of the “open
season” for ﬁrst semester freshman
men, new students and old will have
a taste of the semi-annual whirl of so-
cial and conversational events which
precede the pledging of new frater-
nity men each semester.

At exactly 2 o’clock ‘Sunday morn-
ing, four days later, rushing season
will be officially closed, and will be
followed by a period of silence, dur-_
ing which no contact with rushees
may be made. -At 5 o’clock Thursday
afternoon, one week from tomorrow,
those who receive bids and accept
will be pledged. '

A new rule put into practice last
semester prevents any student from
pledging a fraternity for one month
after silence period closes, if he has
not accepted a bid immediately. In-
stituted to increase the number of im-
mediate pledges, it showed results
last semester, when a substantial in-
crease in the number of pledges was
reported.

Men’s rushing rules expressly for-
bid the contacting of any prospective
pledge before 8 o’clock Wednesday
morning, or after 2 o’clock Sunday
morning, and no rushee is permitted
to stay in any fraternity house over
night.

During all next week freshmen and
others who receive bids will be sum-
moned to the office of the dean of
men to make their choice. Thursday
afternoon a.t 5 o’clock the new pledges
will go to the fraternity house of
their selection for the pledging cere-
monies.

Last semester an average of 14
men pledged each fraternity, with Del-
ta Tau Delta and Kappa Sigma far
in the lead. The Delts pledged 25
men immediately after silence period,
and the Kappa Sigs 20.

‘Coincident -with the pledging of
new men %iritiw.. 55311» cam-
pus will begin the period of initia-
tion of previously pledged men. Ac-
cording to regulations set up by the
men’s fraternity committee, no man
may be initiated with —a scholastic av-
erage of less than 11 credits and eight
quality points. Interfraternity Coun-
cil, at a meeting late in 1935, put it-
self on record as opposed to any
lightening of the traditional ordeal
known as “Hell VVeek.”

Dr. Smith To Address
Social Science Group

Chicago Philosophy Professor To Talk
On “Custom, Gossip, Legislation”

ophy at the University of Chicago,
will speak before the Social Science
Seminar Friday in Room 1001, Cathe-
dral, at 1:30 o’clock.

The subject of Dr. Smith's address
will be “Custom, Gossip and Legisla-
tion.” In addition to holding a po-
sition on the University of Chicago

tor of the international Journal of
Ethics, and has also written a number
of books, some of which are: “The
American Philosophy of Equality,”

“Beyond Conscience,” and “Philos-
ophers in Hades.”
There will be a dinner in Dr.

Smitlfs honor in the Faculty Club
rooms Friday evening.

Follow TheArrow To The All-U Dance,
SFA Committee Markers Rlecommend

 

“Follow the arrow” may be just a
child's game, but there will be plenty
of University couples following the ar-
rows which the SFA committee has
set up all over the campus pointing to-
ward the Schenley ballroom, the
scene of the “All-U Dance” this after-
noon, from 3 to 6 o’clock.

Three judges will select the two
outstanding dance teams in’ a contest
dance scheduled to begin at 5 o’clock.
First prize will be two tickets to the
College Association formal, February
28, and second award will be two tick-
ets to the Engineering Association
(lance, scheduled for March 6.

Judges will be Carl Distelhorst, in-
structor in accounting; Miss Isabelle
Anderson, assistant dean of women;
Theodore Siedle, assistant to the dean
of the School of Education; and Earl
Mellen, lea.der of the orchestra for
the dance. In case of a tie, ‘William
McQuade, CE37, will break the dead-
lock.

Identiﬁcation tags will be worn by
all the couples at the dance. Intro-
ductions, therefore, will not be so

necessary. These tags will be used
for pass-out checks.

One feature of the dance which
no doubt will attract many is the
idea of every other dance being a tag
(lance. In the past this feature, or
bane——according to_ your opinion—has
proved popular at such events as the
Pitt News Style Show.

‘Chairman McQuade, of the All-U
Affair, intimated strongly-—some say
promised—tl1at there will be a big
surprise. Although he was question-
ed closely by this reporter, he refused
to give out any details, except that
the surprise would be announced at
the dance. And there that matter
rests.

The dance contest will begin at 5
o’clock. The competing couples will
go through an elimination process,
after which, the chairman hopes, two
couples will be chosen to the satisfac-
tion of all. However, as in other con-
tests, the decision of the judges will
be ﬁnal. -

The price of admission is 25 cents
a person and is payable at the door.

First CA Dance
Becomes Formal

Keiser Reveals Change Of Policy,
With Informal Coming Later

Reversing custom of past years,
Paul Keiser, ’36, president of the Col-
lege Association, announces that the
cabinet of that group has decided to
make its ﬁrst dance of this semester
a formal, instead of the traditional in-
formal.

Sponsoring two inexpensive dances
each semester, the -C‘A’s policy in the
past has been to lead off each series
of two with an informal, follow it up
with a late-semester formal.

Feeling that this time of year is
more conducive to the enjoyment of
formal affairs, the Association has
turned its schedule about, a.nd will
present its second semester formal
on Friday, February 28.

Tickets for this affair will go on
sale today at the-Association’s pecu-

.. li arly dnexpensive .rate.-of-.$-1-- az.-scrapie.-

The Schenley Hotel has already
been secured for the affair, but no
orchestra has been selected.

One dollar tickets will be available
beginning today in the office of the
College, Room 205, State Hall, in the
office of the dea.n of men, Room 8-01,
Cathedral, and are being sold by
members of the cabinet.

Last semester, the CA introduced
the idea of charging $1 for individual
dances instead of its customary pol-
icy of selling membership tickets at
$2 covering admission to both dances.

At a cabinet meeting of the group
yesterday afternoon, tickets were
distributed to cabinet aides and pre-
‘liminary plans drawn up. William
Hughes, '36, is social chairman of the
organization.

Druids To Interview
Applicants Tomorrow

First-Semester Sophomore Petitioners
Should Be Present At Meeting

Druids, men’s national sophomore
honorary fraternity, will interview all
students petitioning for membership
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o’clock in
Room 801, Cathedral.

Only ﬁrst—semester sophomores are
eligible for tapping at this time, and
must be present for the interview.
The interviewing committee is com-
posed of Frank Engel, Ed38, presi-
dent, and Joseph Morrow, C38, Frank
Souchak, Ed3S, John Baker, BA38, and
Alex Willson, C38.

According to Engel, any other
Druids who wish to be present for
the interview are also permitted to
attend.

Reduced Rates Offered
Students For Nixon Play

Tickets to Katherine Cornell’s re-
vival of George Bernard Shaw’s
“Saint Jban” will be available at re-
duced rates to students in Room 801,
Cathedral, on VVednesday, from 1 to
3:30 o’clock.

"The only seats available are second
balcony seats, priced at 61 cents. in-
cluding tax. Tickets may be purchas-
ed from Lawrence Greenberger. Wed-
nesday is the only day they can be
bought through the University.

Miss Mary Milburn, secretary to the
dean of men, has announced that no
reduced rates will be offered for
Walter Hampden’s “Cyrano de Ber-
gerac.”

Holbrook At Institute

E. A. !Holbrook, dean of the School
of Engineering and Mines, is attend-
ing the annual meeting of the Amer-
ican Institute of Mining and Metal-
lurgical Engineering all this week in
the Engineering buil=ing, New York
City. At this meeting he will present
a paper entitled “Safety Education in
the Mineral Industries.”

Mr. Holbrook will also preside on
Wednesday at the annual meeting of
the American Mining Standards
Committee of which he is the nation-
:11 chairman. .

Barton Checks Up,
Finds Prosperity

Demands For College Graduates
Show 300 Per Cent Increase A

Prosperity is returning. At least
that is the opinion of J. -Clyde Barton,
director of the University placement
bureau, who backs up his declaration
on the fact that demands of compan-
ies recruiting college graduates for
positions have increased by 300 per
cent over last year.

“Based on the number of advance
engagements for interviews with sen-
iors which have already been made
by representatives of the personnel
departments of nationally known cor-
porations, it appears that the possi-
bility of University graduates’ mak-
ing proﬁtable connections with indus-
try will be 300 per cent better than
last year,” according to Barton.

Since the ﬁrst of the year, more
organizations seeking employes have

.«in«tei~v-iexve-cl seniors at the Universi“

than for the whole of 1935. E. A. Hol-
brook, dean of the Schools of Engi-
neering and Mines, agrees with Bar-
ton by declaring that the ready mar-

ket for engineers will be the best
since 1930. Opportunities in other
professions are proportionally as

good as those for engineers.

Recent announcement by the Bu-
reau of Business Research that con-
ditions in the steel industry are on
the upturn is borne out by the fact
that all members of the 1935 class in
metallurgy have been placed in po-
sitions this year along with many
graduates of earlier classes.

Youth Is No Aid

In Engineering,

. . - . . . . o o

Holbrook Writes _,

Youth counts against a student who
studies engineering, E. A. Holbrook,
dean of the School of Engineering and
Mines, believes. In an article, “The
High School Boy Considers Engineer-
ing,” appearing in the current issue
of Careers and Hobbies magazine,

Dean Holbrook points out that gifted
young men who get through high
school quickly and then enter engi-
neering school often have trouble in
the last two years of their engineer-
ing training, due to immaturity .

“Most of the industrial corporations
that interview University of Pitts-
burgh students at graduation time
will not take engineering graduates
under 21 years of age. I feel that a.
boy should be at least 17 years old
when entering engineering school as
a freshman.”

Good health and a good scholarship
are two requisites for success in the
study of engineering, Dean Holbrook
points out. Students who do not like
mathematics and the sciences should
consider other ﬁelds, he says.

Knowledge of English is valua.ble
to the engineer, too, the article
shows. “There is a curious notion
.the—-.. writer says,
“that a boy who will study engineer-
ing need not pay great attention to
the study of English. Nothing could
be further from the truth. Sooner or
-later, the boy who expects to be a suc-
cessful engineer must learn to speak
and write the English language with
clarity.”

Elliott Scheduled To Talk
Before Sigma Kappa Phi

Philip C. Elliott, assistant profes-
sor of ﬁne arts, will be the speaker
tomorrow evening when Sigma Kappa
Phi, national honorary language fra-
ternity, holds its regular February
meeting at the University Cafeteria.

lFollowing dinner, which will be
served at ‘6 o’clock, M1; Elliott will
discuss “The Art of France.”

The organization is now making
plans for the Sigma Kappa Phi open
house which will be held Friday eve-
ing, March 6, and will be open to
everyone.

Connecticut Eccentric
Crowds 415 Words
Into Postcard

By Milton G. Lehman, Jr.

Radiating from the after-effects of
their debate on the Supreme Court,
given over the NBC network with
Stanford University on January 20th,
James Eichelberger, C38, and Frank
Doeringer, C36, upholders of the af-
firmative, are kept busy with the load
of fan mail from all parts of the coun-
try.

The debate received the compli-
ments of amateur debaters, high
school students, and political fanat-
ics: the parcel of fan mail, carried
uonchalantly by Israel Goldberg, C36,
intercollegiate manager of the debate
team, contained over 50 notes, post
cards, and typed letters. Requests
for copies of the speeches came from
California, New Jersey, Florida, New
York, North Dakota, Kentucky, Mary-
land, Michigan, Nebraska, Connecti-
cut, and even Schuylkill County, Penn-
sylvania. ,

Much of the fanatic mail bears rep-
etition. Probably the most astound-
ing note received by the men who so
assiduously tore down the power of
the Court, was one from a petite (we
judge so from the handwriting) young
high school miss of Avalon. The let-
ter, addressed to Manager Goldberg,
stated that she enjoyed the debate
immensely and would like the team to
send her ten reasons why we should
uphold the constitution of the United
States. She needed the information
for a high school theme.

The debate, as you may or may not
know, was interrupted before the Uni-
versity’s rebuttal was presented, in
order to broadcast a news ﬂash re-
garding the condition of the ailing
king of England. Several letters re-

flect the listeners' “attitude to the in-
terruption. A gentleman from As-
toria, Long Island, writes: “I am
afraid that I would have much rather
heard the end of the debate before
you presented the news concerning
the sinking health of the late King
George.” 1

Many of the requests for copies
were unique. A young girl from Chi-
cago states: “U11t'ortunately our ra-
dio has a disagreeable habit of fading
out at the most important points so
that I missed some of the key parts
of the debate. I would like to have a
copy of the debate. Enclosed ﬁnd a
stamped self-addressed envelope and
ﬁfteen cents. If there is any addi-
tional cost, please send them COD
. . . P. S. If not possible to obtain
both sides, I would rather have the
affirmative.” Then she omitted her

. address.

A Nicholasville, Kentucky, admirer
relates: “Out here in Kentucky we
happened to tune in this afternoon
(being snow bound on our little farm)
and heard the debate between the
University of Pittsburgh and Stanford
University. We are writing to ask
if you have printed copies of the re-
marks so heroically brought out by
your speakers.”

A woman from Orwigsburg, Pa.,
writes: “To the President of Pitts-
burgh University—Good Sir: In one
of our county papers I read of the de-
bate over radio between Pittsburgh
and Stanford. which I am sure was
very interesting. I cannot afford a
radio, therefore miss so much of in-
terest and educational. I am passed
man’s allotted years on this earth
but still take a lot of interest in
children and the world's doings. Only
when I am not raising children or
calling on friends do I have a chance
to enjoy radio speeches . . I am
sure it would be hard to know my
religion and my politics as I never
settle my mind for any. subject unless

It looks like a big day
for students, what with

planned for 11:50 and an
SFA 3 o’clock tea dance.

Engineers Take
Poll To Decide

Dance Location

A poll taken of the members of the
ﬁve engineering seminars last Thurs-
day has shown that the Engineering
Association’s dance, scheduled for
Friday, March 6, will be held at the
Hotel Schenley Ballroom. The deci-
sion has been announced by William
Britton, ChE36, chairman of the af-
fair.

Although the orchestra has not yet
been chosen, the committee is consid-
ering three local bands popular with
the engineers.

Tickets for the dance are now on
sale and may be obtained from cabi-
net members of the association in
Room 801, Cathedral, and at the of-
ﬁce of the dean of Engineering and
Mines, Room 104, Thaw Hall. These
tickets include membership in the
Engineering Association and permit
the purchasers to attend the Engi-
neers’ Smoker on April 7 as well as
the dance.

Robert Kerr, EE36, has been ap-
pointed chairman for the smoker.

‘Listener’ Lacking Set
Congratulates Pitt
3 Team Anyhow

I know both sides, I wish the world
would do that today.”

Probably the most maniacal com-
munication received was from a witty
fellow from New Haven, Connecti-
cut. The note, which contained a re-
quest for a copy of the debate, is one
of the neatest jobs We have ever seen
of crowding words into little space.
Straining.‘ our eyes to read, we count-
ed 415 words penned into the conﬁnes
of a penny postal card. While count-
ing the words was difficult, decipher-
ing the message was another thing.
\Ve copy the legible parts exactly,
and leave it to you to decipher.

“Not one human is represented in
Congress, etc. That’s why we have
cotton and gold a.nd copper kings,
timber counts, coal barons, (soft and
hard), steel and steal magnates. If
the president is dying no British ra-
dio is cut off—neither does the At-
lantic stop to grieve—and get seasick
from swallowing parts of England.
Hate the British? No. Glad you won
your debate.”

There has to be a crank in every
piece of good machinery. But not all
the comments were grotesque. A
friend of the debaters who tuned in
from Bismarck, North Dakota, com-
ments: “I never heard a better argu-
ment for what must happen if we
are not to be controlled by a political-
ly selected group of corporation
lawyers. The 5 to 4 decisions will
mean the eventual downfall of our
country if they are ever allowed to
continue, which, if it ever does hap-
pen, cannot ever be blamed upon the
common people. More power to men
who talked as these men talked.
North Dakota is wholeheartedly with

them."

Shorter Classes Enable
Session To Begin
At 11:50 O’Clock

At 11:50 o’clock this morning stu-
dents from all schools will assemble
in the main auditorium of the First
United Presbyterian Church to hear
an address by Dr. Henry H. Crane, of
Scranton. The subject of Dr.
Crane’s address is "Truths for These
Times.”

Although this is his ﬁrst appear-
ance at the University, Dr, Crane is
well known on other campi, having
made extensive lecture tours to ma-
jor colleges throughout the country.
He has addressed student assemblies
in more than 35 universities, and
has spoken before clubs and other
social groups in three-quarters of the
states of the Union,

Dr. Crane is vitally interested in
college affairs, having been active on
campus as a.n undergraduate. He
was leader of the glee club, member
of the dramatic society, and partici-
pant in several sports, being select-
ed as an All-American guard in bas-
ketball during his last year.

Dr_ Crane is the nephew of the late
newspaper columnist, Dr. Frank
Crane, and spent considerable time
with him in the Orient. They collab-
orated in the writing of several books
and articles.

Today's assembly was originally
scheduled for Memorial Hall, but be-
cause of reconstruction work being
done, the meeting was shifted to the
church auditorium. The building is
opposite the Schenley Apartments on
Fifth Avenue.

DI‘. Crane is scheduled to speak
before Tuesday and Wednesday ﬁfth
hour assemblies, also to be held in
the church auditorium. The meetings
will be open to University students.

 

Jefferson’s View
Quoted By Henry

Att_9rI}§y,,,§l',§411$§,,,B,efore Freshman
Debaters On Supreme Court

. “The opinion, which gives to the
judges the right to decide which laws
are constitutional and which are not,
would make the judiciary a despotic
branch,’ said Attorney John Henry,
quoting Thomas Jefferson’s. reaction
to the famous decisionof the Supreme
Court in Marbury vs. Madison.

Mr. Henry, author of the recently
published book criticizing the Court,
“Nine Above the Law,” spoke Thurs-
day evening in the Cathedral before
the freshman unit of the W'omen’s
Debating Association. Members of
the men's and women’s University de-
bating squads, and representatives of
Mt. Mercy, Carnegie Tech, and Du-
quesne, were guests of the unit.

The speaker stressed the fact that
the Court has often reversed itself in
its interpretations. “The Court re-
versed a hundred year precedent of
the Federal government's power to
tax when it nulliﬁed the law to
abolish child labor by taxation. Pre-
viously, it had approved a high tax
on oleomargarine colored like butter
and on sulphurous matches for protec-
tion of health.”

 

Oil Seminar Becomes
Organizational Meet

The oil and gas seminar, because of
the illness of Harold C. George, pro-
fessor and head of the department,
had no speaker Thursday. Instead a
general organization meeting was
held. Mr. George has been absent
since VVednesday with a bad cold.

Dr. Oliver L. Brandes, industrial fel-
low at the Mellon Institute, spoke at
the petroleum reﬁning seminar on
“Manufacture of Gas by Polymeriza-
tion.”

The chemical engineering group, at
the Fellows’ Room in the Mellon Insti-
tute heard Dr. Reginald L. Wakeman,
fellow at the Institute, speak on “Mod-
ern Plastics.” This was the eighth in
a series of technological lectures.

Editorial Briefs

Due to a strange malady, a girl in the midwest
has been sleeping for  period of ﬁve years. Doubt-
less our professors could point out several seniors
who are now but one year shy of tying her record.

Sentiment ran so strongly about a recentexpose
of student cheating at the University of North Car-
olina that the student body president resigned
after confessinghe had cheated in a- freshman
French course four years ago. VVell, anyway you
have to admire his memory.

It will certainly be a triumph for the Philadel-
phia“Chamber of Commerce if that city retains the
title “The City of Brotherly Love after next
summer ’s Democratic convention.

The government is now sponsoring a school to
teach women the art of speaking. Any day now
we ’re looking for someone to start offering a series
of swimming lessons for ﬁsh.

Tickets to future campus dances are being
awarded as prizes to the best dancing couples in a
contest at this afternoon’s SFA tea dance. \Ve
wonder if the committee has considered what to do
in case members of one of the winning couples

should go pffft before the date of the ‘dance.

We Don’t Doubt It

In the report of Haverford College it was revealed that
the infirmary was :1 more popular place than most people
thought. During the 1934-35 school year nearly one-third
of the entire student body spent at least one day there,
while each student made on the average ten visits for
treatment of minor ailments.

Wrestlers were found to need the most treatment.

An ldea
Before a recent dance at the ‘University of Minnesota
the daily paper printed ballots to be ﬁlled in by students
giving the titles of songs they did not wish to hear.

Oh, Doctor!

A short time ago :1 doctor from Austin showed movies
of operations he had performed for the beneﬁts of pre-
medical and other students of the University of Texas.
During the show the surgeon kept up a running. ﬁre of
explanations and wise cracks which kept the spectators
in laughter.

From time to time people had to leave and some faint-
ed and had to be carried out. The climax was reached
when pictures were shown of a very delicate operation
on the patient’s heart. Such a large crowd turned out
that policemen were present to keep order.

 

Hey, Schenckl
The Senior Ball at the University of Syracuse netted
a proﬁt of $364.

What, No Fire Insurance?
In 1930 college fraternities owned houses valued at
$75,000,000-

of a shovel.”

Graduates

Homer C. “Lefty” Wadsworth, Ed35, is now enrolled
in the Chicago Theological Seminary, which is aﬂiliated
with the University of Chicago. Wadsworth was presi-
dent of the YMCA here last year, was :1 member of SFA,
in which he was chairman of the Organizations Commit-
tee, made ODK, was a member of the varsity basketball
squad, and was outstanding in the furthering of non-
fraternity men’s welfare.

Marshall W. “Bud” Baker, BA35, is now a salesman for
the Hoffman Lumber Company, but that won’t keep this
Delta Tau Delta alumnus from attending Cap and Gown
Graduate Club meetings. Although Baker was outstand-
ing in numerous activities, his fame rests chieﬂy on his
charm as a. “feminine” lead for Cap and Gown shows.
He could slink across a stage like few villainesses, or
skip about with the best of ingenues. ODK members
called him “Brother.” '

all of ’35, who now are entrusted with the sacred task of
embuing growing youngsters with intellectual curiosity
and good citizenship . . etc.:

Cast Of ‘Candida’ Contains Former Waiter,
Philosopher, Freshman; Scholarship High

YVhen questionnaires were distribut-
ed by an impertinent Pitt News re-
porter to members of the cast of “The
Show-Off,” Pitt Players’ big show of
November last, some enlightening dis-
closures were made concerning the
more intimate side of the Players’
lives.

Heartened by the avid spirit in
which the public received these rev-
elations of the “stars,” the reporter
has repeated the questionnaire pro-
cedure for George Bernard Shaw’s
“Candida,” to be given by the Players
next Vvednesday and Thursday eve-
nings in the new Civic Playhouse at
222 Craft Avenue. And this in spite
of his edito1"s cruel query, “Don’t
y’think our 1°eade1's’ll get tired of it
the third time or so?”

One of the facts uncovered, which
the Players wish to have emphasized,
is the scholastic and intellectual su-
periority of the cast.
Maurer is a high honor student; the
rest are in the honor group, with the
possible exception of Marquis Patter-
son, C36, who failed to designate on
the typewritten form his precise
standing.

Louise McKirdy, 036, who plays the
role of “Candida,” was born in VVash-
ington, D. C., and attended Vvestern
High School of that city. She was edi-
tor of her class year book, She ap-
peared here in Pitt Players’ “xF‘ashion”
and “March Hares” last year, and is
overjoyed at the prospect of achieving
further fame in “Candida.”

Evincing her sincerity, she says: “I ,-

like my role in “Candida.” better than
any other I have ever had. I go home
nights in such an exalted state of

mind that I have difficulty getting _.l_ .

back to earth.”
Herrymon Maurer, C36, was born in

Pittsburgl1—to be speciﬁc, in the Per-  if

rysville Avenue district, In “Candida,”
he is Very Reverend James Morrell, a

stern Christian Socialist, who is al- E’

most chiselled out of a wife. Mr.

Maurer attended Dartmouth for two ..
years before coming to the University. ’

His hobbies are sculptoring and boat-

ing, and writing things of a metaph_vs- .1.
Last year, he attempted  ‘

ical nature.
to “destroy civilization in ten articles
in the Pitt News.”

As a critic, Mr. Maurer speaks of
“Candida:” “ ‘Candida’ is unique
among Shaw’s plays—-there are few
direct suggestions of social preaching
on the part of the author. The politic-
al—social credo of Mr. Shaw at times
seems a little stale and unreal today,
however much -it may have aroused
thought at the time it was presented.

“By telling his story in the terms
of human individuals, and by not lik-
ing them directly. Mr. Shaw in reality
p1'eaches far better and far more
thoroughly.” _

Marquis Beaucourt Patterson, C36,
takes the role of Eugene Marchbanks,
the poet of whose exquisite nature the
minister, James Morrell, is contempt-
uous until he feels its strength, Mr.
Patterson has done everything and
been everywhere. He was successive-
ly a head waiter, fry cook (consult
him to ﬁnd out what a. “fry cook” is),
and a clerk. He has been on the stage
since he was 14 years old, and has
played with amateur groups, with Jim
lHall’s Tent Players, Billy Bryant’s
Show Beat (on the Mississippi), and
with the Manchester Players.

Mr. Patterson played the part of the
little girl who gets hit on the head
with a bottle in “Ten Nights in a Bar-
room.” He played with dolls as a

H erry1no11 '

 

child, but has since graduated to pup-
pets. He has become famous for his
renditions of French songs (songs in
the French tongue).

Betty Knop, Ed37, who sang “Daddy
VVouldn’t Buy Me a Bow-wow” be-
tween the ﬁrst and second act of
“Fashion” last year, and was the only
person to make George Seibel, local
dramatic critic, laugh that evening,
will be Prossy, the little secretary who
has successfully repressed her roman-
tic affection for her employer, James
Morrell. Miss Knop graduated from
St. Xavier Academy in 1931. Her fa-
vorite hobby is performing panto-
mimes before a mirror in her bed-
room, and practicing reading in the
furnace room of Alumni ll-Iall, She
spends her pin money at the Nixon,

Charles W. Blaker, EE37, will take
the part of Burgess, “made coarse by
the compulsory selﬁshness of petty
commerce.” He played in high school

plays at South Hills High School,
and culminated his career there with
the lead in his class play. He had
considerable difficulty in learning
the Cockney dialogue necessary for
“Candida.”

William Kunkel is a newcomer to
Pitt Players. He is a freshman, hav-
ing graduated from Taylor Allderdice
High School last June with high
honor. He plays the role of Lexy,
the young Oxford graduate assisting
Reverend Morrell with his humani-
tarian work in the slums of London,

His chief hobbies are playing piano
and loaﬁng. His attitude toward wo-
men is Puritannical; he does not ap-
prove of girls who chew gum and
smoke.

All of the Players are delighted
with the acting opportunities in “Can—
clida.” They believe it to be one of
the most difficult tasks Pitt Players
have ever attacked.

Those Doughty Dukes
Will Return Tomorrow

 

Cats Hope To Surprise Hilltoppers In Second
Game Between Rivals At Stadium

By William K. Trosen ,
“Into the valley of death rode the 600” wrote the poet, but the
sports writer says, “Against those terrible Dukes ran the Pitt basket-

ball team.”
That was true ten days ago.

Tomorrow night Coach Carlson ’s

varsity cagers get a second crack at Duqiiesnes iniglity quintet, and
if the Panthers have their v.'a_v,'tlic above stateinent will be less ap-
propos than a valentine that arrives today.

It doesn’t take a memory expert toe

recall that not so long ago, ten days
ago to be exact, the Panthers and toe
Dukes, plating in a packed stadium
put on one of their usual swell shows.
Chick Davies’ boys we1'e Dlelltii’ 119i
that night. They popped them In
from al possible angles, long shots,
short shots, one-handed shots, until
the boys were themselves out walking
back to their positions for a new toss-
up.

At one time on that fateful night,
the Dukes led by as many as 17 points
and ﬁnally they wound up on the
happy end of a 54-42 count. A slight
built boy who answers to the Irish
name, Malackney, provided most’ of
the ﬁre-works of the evening by sink-
ing 21 points. He did everything with
the ball execept to balance it on hlS
nose and he could have probably (10110
that if he had tried.

Tomorrow night these two city
rivals get together again, and if there
are any gods of fortune ﬂitting around
the Stadium pillars, let them be fore-
warned of the prayers that will be ut-
tered in their direction tonight and
tomorrow. Both teams have played
one game since they last met, and
both are in tip-top shape for this last
meeting.

As a result of the trouncing given
the Panthers, the Dukes now possess
undisputed ﬁrst—place honors in the
city tit‘;e race. Davies’ boys had pre-
viously whipped the Tech Tartans,
while the latter nosed out the Golden
Cats, so that the latest returns ﬁnd
the Dukes with two victories, no
losses; Carnegie Tech with a.n even
split in two games; and strange as it
seems, the Panthers at the bottom
with two defeats. A loss tomorrow
night for the Panthers would put
them out of the running for the title
which they have shared the past two
years with Duquesne.

Dukes’ Record Impressive

The Dukes come to the Stadium to-
morrow night with a record of eight
straight triumphs and 12 out of 13
for the season’s total. Only Long Is-
land U. was tough enough to take
the Dukes, 36-34. Davies has done
wonders with his team this year,
building them up from practically new
material into a ﬁve that is called the
“perfect” team. In their 13 games,
they have averaged well over 50
points a game and have seldom been
pushed to win.

Chick will probably rely on the
same starting combination that click-
ed so well in the last game with the
Panthers, with the possible exception
of Pickles Kreiiing starting in Red
Malackney’s position. Kreiling held
down the varsity post until he injured
his wrist, then Malackney stepped in
with a. nea.t bit of substituting. It is
probable that Davies will give Malach-
ney the nod, because of his ﬁne show-
ing in the ﬁrst game.

On the other hand, Carlson, too, will
start his strongest combination. Billy
Jesko, the Pa11ther’s individual hero
in the last Duke downpour, is a cer-
tain starter, with either Captain Ted
Roderick or Miles Zeleznick at the
other forward post.
again play opposite Kweller and at
the guard places will be Bob Johnson.
another star of the Duke game, and
either Ed Spotovich or Rags Radvan-
sky.

The preliminary game again ﬁnds
the two freshman teams of Pitt and
Duquesne playing. They put on a
great game their ﬁrst appearance,
with the Panther Cubs taking the
game in a ﬁnal spurt, 28-26. This
game will begin at 7 o’clock with the

varsity immediately following, at ap-
proximately 8 o’clock,

Eight Marks
Fall ln News
Benefit Meet

\Vith several hundred pairs of eyes
focused directly on a picked squad of
40 thinclads in the Track House, eight
new records were set up amid an
Olympic ceremony that shoved a
Panther track team under the spot-
light Saturday and established the
University as the ﬁrst to aid in the
drive to ﬁnance the American team
entry for the 1936 Olympic Games.

Ken Ryden became perhaps the out-
standing freshman on the most prom-
ising yearling squad in Pitt track hist-
ory by virtue of cracking Irv Brown’s
mark in the 50-yard low and high-
hurdle events by a wide margin. First,
the lanky Ken stepped out to lower
the high-hurdle standard to 6.6 sec-
onds, one-tenth second faster than the
varsity record established ﬁve min-
utes later by Lasky. Topping this off
with a six-second record in the lows,
Ryden again bettered Fleming’s and
Lasky's varsity record by one—tenth of
a second.

Although cracking no records, an-
other yearling. Charlie Parsons, scored
no less than 24 points, ﬁnishing ﬁrst
in the hop, step and jump, second in
ﬁve events, and tying for ﬁrst in the
high jump with Snyder to win high-
scoring honors of the meet.

As was expected, Pete Bennett
broke Robusch‘s 13-year-old mark in
the high jump. Bennett’s last leap
cleared six feet, one and three-eighths
inches.

VVal"er Good, who has been improv-
ing meet by meet in the hop, step and
jump, pulled himself out to 44 feet,
ﬁve and one-half inches in addition to
soaring 21 feet, eight and one-half
inches in the broad jump. In addition
to cracking his own record in the for-
mer event, Good annexed high scoring
honors in the varsity competition with
17" points. Bennett copped runner-up
honors with a total of 12 markers.

Cooper clicked off 5.5 seconds in
the freshman 50-yard dash, cracking
Brown’s 5.6 mark. Then, he sped
through the two-lap championship
race in 34 seconds to register a. dou-
ble victory for the day.

Edson Routch hung up the ﬁfth and
ﬁnal yearling record of the afternoon
when he leaped 22 feet, four and one-
half inches in the broad jump, Andy
Lasky lowered his own record in the
high-hurdles to 6.7 seconds for the
third varsity and eighth meet record
of the day. He also tied Fleming’s 6.1
second mark‘ in the lows.

In the feature event. the half-mile
duel between Ha-rold Connelly and
Charles Groat, the indoor and outdoor
record—holders respectively spilled on
the south-west bend when Groat, run-
ning wide in the lead, and Connelly,
just a. step behind, accidentally cross-
ed steps. Groat went ﬂying to the
cin-ders and Connelly went over the
side-boards inside of the track.

The Pitt re‘ay team, composed of
Connelly, Groat, McConnell, and
Thomas, departs for Ann Arbor, Mich-
igan, today to compete in the Michi-
gan relays, scheduled for tomorrow
night in the Michigan ﬁeld house.

O A C H O L S O N, varsity track
mentor, hopes to reserve passage
on the United States Olympic boat. for
several of his 1936 squad.
Saturday, the largest track squad in
Pitt history showed promise of fulfill-
ing that hope.

Panther Passers
Down Owls, 48-42

Rally In Second Half Gives Cagers
Third Straight League Victory

 

Playing in Ten1ple’s own backyard,
the Pitt varsity basketball team get
revenge for last season's licking from
the Owls down in Philadelphia on Fri-
day night by putting together a strong
second half rally to beat them, 48 to
42, and advance to within striking dis-
tance of ﬁrst place in the Eastern In-
tercollegiate Conference. It was the
Panthers third straight league vic-
tory. ‘

On three different occasions in the
ﬁrst-half the count was knotted, at 12,
16, and 18-all. Coach Jimmy Usilton’s
boys headed for the dressing rooms
at half time with a slender 22-21 lead.

A typical Pitt rally during the ﬁrst
few minutes of the second half put
the game in the bag for the Pi"ts-
burghers as a barrage of ﬁeld goals
soon built a 37-24 lead for the Carl-
son-coaclied machine. Don Shield’s
shooting reduced the Panther lead to
eight points at 46-38, with about ﬁve
minutes remaining to play.

Captain Ted Roderick and Pete
Noon put on a great scoring show for
the 4.500 spectators, Roderick getting
15 points and the towering Panther
center sinking ﬁve baskets. Shields,
Owl forward, led the losers in scor-
ing with 12 points.

Jacobs Stars As
Lambda Chis Win
Leagzw A Honors

Defeat Phi Kappa, Delt Bowlers
In Exciting Playoff Match;
Face Phi Delt-s Tomorrow

By Leonard Levison

One point decided it. Pranson
“Jal«:e" Jacobs whipped the ball down
the alley. 'l"hree pins went over. One
pin tottered in the air, and then top-
pled over. Thus Lambda Cl1i’s won
the Iiiterfraternity League A cham-
pionship by the narrow margin of that
one wavering point.

It was a heart-stopping climax to a
thrill—packed tourney whose cliampion
gwz-isn’t decided until the last roll of
the last frazne. Lambda Chi was
battling the champion Phi Kappas.
Jake Jacobs raised his hand high and
with it went the fate of Lambda Chi
Alpha. He needed two strikes and
tour pins. His ﬁrst shot split the
center, clearing the ailey. His next

every pin tumbled down. The ﬁnal
shot, already described, made
Lambda Chi Alpha certain of at least
one cup and gave it the possibility of
making that cup a ﬁrst-place trophy.

So close were Lambda Chi Alpha,
Phi Kappa, and Delta Tau Deita.
matched that it required two play-oil?
matches to determine a winner. After
the three had completed their regular
schedule with a record of 14 wins and
4 losses, they went into a t.hree-game:
playoif, Thursday night. which ended
in a tie. Each team finished ﬁrst, sec-
ond, and third in this three-team
tliree-game match.

Playoff Match Decides

Finalfy, it was decided to match the
Delts against the Phi Kappas, with
Lambda Chi meeting the winner by a
comparative score method. Smother-
ing the Delts, the Phi Kappas rolled
through to three straight triumphs.
Johnny Urban paced the victors, scor-
ing over 200 in two ganies. Pritcliaro
turned in the highest total for the
losers. -

The Phi Kappa team scores were
680, 780, and 773, and it was these
scores that Lambda Chi Alpha had to
beat on Friday afternoon. In the first
game the Lambda Chis compiled 710
points for their ﬁrst victory. They
dropped the second, bowling" out a to-
tal of 663 to the Phi Kappa high of
780. Then with Jacobs in the leading
ro‘:e they knocked down a. 774 score,
topping their opponents’ 773 by one
lone pin.

Daniell, Cook, Sprowl, Sare, and
Jacobs formed the victorious quintet
with Ramsey serving as an alternate
in theﬁnal game. Jake Jacobs has
been the high scorer in the Lambda
Chi lineup throughout the competi-
tion. Incidentally his cup—winiiing
score was a 201.

Phi Delta Theta captured the
League B toga and is scheduled to ap-
pear against Lambda Chi Alpha in
the ﬁnal playoffs tomorrow niglit at
the tournament stamping grounds, the
Center-Neville Alleys

the Retail Research Bureau of the]
University, gives hints to coeds who
are planning their spring wardrobes.

Suits will still be the most popu-
lar daytime costumes on the campus.
The mannish inﬂuence will be seen
in suits, the Duke of Gloucester suit
being an example of this type. This
suit is modeled of grey ﬂannel with
wide stitched lapels that are rolled
to the second button.

The Fashion Reporter states that
the 38-inch topcoat is regarded as a
leading spring silhouette as a sepa-
rate coat as well as a third part of the
ensemble.

Another version of the suit, the
cape ensemble, will be seen this
spring. Smooth lines, a center plait

in the skirt, and contrast in color
and pattern are features of the cape
ensemble.

Gray ﬂannel, garbardine, wide her-
ringbone, Glen plaids, and checks are
important materials for suits. Color
accents for suits may be either pur-
pl‘y blud, yellow, brown, f-Dubonnet
red and white.

Jacket costumes of silks or wool
will make the most practical and
smart edition to the wardrobe for
daytime wear. They can be worn un-
der the coats now and later as 21 sep-
arate outﬁt. The sleeves of dresses
were designed to make waistlines
and hips look slimn1er—fullness at
the tops of the shoulders, in shir-
rings. tucks, and folds.

Light neutrals, black and navy with
white accents, or color touches or
print trimmings; ginger brown, cor-
al rust, ruby red, violet blues, and
grey blues are important colors for
spring.

Coeds To Try Out
Dickering Ability

Junior Women Schedule Rummage
Sale At East Liberty Market

 

 

At least 20 coeds will invade the
market house in East Liberty on the
corner of Broad Street and Larimer
Avenue Saturday, February 29, for
that’s the place and day the junior
women have scheduled for their rum-
mage sale.

After two weeks of gathering
clothes, lamps, old sheet music like

“-Glad Rag Doll,” and such, the jun-
iors will attempt to get selling expe-
ience on the day of the sale. The
committee will try to ﬁnd out which
is the better bargainer, the coed or
the customer, so they say.

At a cabinet meeting last week, the
following women were made chair-
men of class events: Dorothy Dress-
er, C, of the Mothers’ Tea which is
scheduled on April 22; and Dolores
Hoffman, Ed, of the picnic set for
May 22. Miss ‘Mary McKenna, in-
structor in English and class adviser,
will assist Miss Dresser in preparing
for the Mothers’ Tea. The Emerald
luncheon chairman will be announced
later.

The committee for the rummage
sale is asking junior women to assist
them by getting in touch with some
member of the committee within the
next three days. They are asked to
tell what they intend to contribute
and whether it will be necessary to
have some one call for the rummage
or whether it will be possible to bring
it to school.
