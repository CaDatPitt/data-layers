New Societies Need ,
Closer Study Gillin
Tells “Anthropologists

The out-going president of
the American Anthropolog-
ical Association on Saturday
exhorted anthropologists to
pay more attention to the
complexities of modern civ-
ilization as a whole, rather
than just to details of those
civilizations. The results, he said,
might help to stem revolutions,.or
larger conﬂicts.

Dr. John P. Gillin, professor of
anthropology at the University

‘told the 65th annual convention

of the association that no modern
complex sociocultural system had
enjoyed the kind of treatment an-
thropologists normally give to
aboriginal tribes. That treatment,
he said, involves an analysis of
the entire culture in both detail
and as a whole.

The meeting, attracting the

largest assemblage in the asso- C

ciation’s history — some 2,300 —
held at the Pittsburgh Hilton Ho-
tel.

Cohesive studies of modern so-
cieties, Dr. Gillin said, would be
of great value: “. . . Many break-
downs and revolutions could be‘
foreseen and perhaps avoided if
we and the inhabitants them-
selves had complete detail plus
holistic (or total) analysis.”

The kind of studies he is rec-
ommending would be done by

‘N Y Times’
Endorses

ACLU Plea

The New York Times ex-

. pressed strong support in a

lead editorial last week for
the letter sent by the Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union

(ACLU) to 900 universities
and college presidents (see Pitt
News, Friday, Nov. 18).

The letter urged them to vig-
orously resist any subpoena by
the .House Committee on Un-
American Activities for member-
ship lists of campus organizations
critical of U.S. policy in Asia.

The Times warned that “free-
dom on campus is indivisible for
freedom in the larger society.”
The paper also stated, “It is not
to the credit of university admin-
istrators that they had to be re-
minded of their responsibilities
by the ACLU.”

The University has not yet re-
acted to the ACLU letter, how-
ever, the Pitt News hopes to ob-
tain a statement from the Chan-
cellor’s office after Thanksgiv-
ing on this most important issue.

teams of specialists, and, if suc-

with some danger signals. He
blamed “inconsistency between
word and deed” as one of the
causes of the Castro revolution
in Cuba. And, he said “inade-
quate adaptation to a tropical en-
vironment threatens the stability
of the Congo state at the present
time.”

A generation ago, the associa-
tion president said, most people
thought of etlrnologists “as ex-
clusively concerned with describ-
ing and analyzing the customs of
exotic tribes living outside west-
tern civilization.” Those customs,
he went on, where “titilating but
bore little or no signiﬁcance in
solving the problems of the mod-
ern world. And many anthropo-
logists themselves were only too
glad to escape from what they
sometimes thought of as the bore-
dom and confusions of modern
civilization." ‘

“But now,” Dr. Gillin -said,
“whether we like it or not anthro-
pology his being drawn into the
modern world.”

Referring to the multitudes of
specialized books on modern cul-
tures, he said: “But one set con-
cerns politics, another econom-
ics, and so on.” And he added,
“Too often in the past, economist
and political scientists, for ex-
ample, conﬁned their studies
mainly to written and printed
documents plus perhaps some in-
terviewing of leaders.”

Two areas relating to the
problem of housing and civil

"attention are the inequities

of slum housing and the need
for open housing, according
to Reverend E._ Biegert of‘
Pittsburgh in a talk Monday

_ night. Rev. Biegert’s presen-

tation was sponsored by the Uni-
versity YWCA ‘chapter as part of
a series on “Urbanization.”

Rev. Biegert urged “better en-

for the slum problem. He sug.

more adequately and quickly.”

He also called for “new hous-
ing for those in low and middle
income brackets,” and that this
housing should be built in the
areas where those people lived,
in order to foster “indigenous,
strong, neighborhoods.”

Rev. Biegert stated that new
housing could be built privately
or publicly. In the first category, ,
he cited “new corporations ex-
perimenting in privately support-
ed low and middle income hous-
ing.” As for public projects, he
said that these endeavors would
have to incorporate “more sensi-
tivity and care in the type of

housing and the location.”

However, he believed that “those

REV. E. BIEGERT relates open housing and

would likely be ineligible, due to
restrictions based on family quo-
tas and criminal’ records.” Rev.
Biegert mentioned the “need for

an aroused citizenry and concert- -

ed pressure from the citizens.”

Turning to the question of open
housing, Rev. Biegert stated that
“this is 61 long run problem,” but
that the effort should be made
now anyway. He said, “there is a
tight money squeeze and not
many middle income families
could buy suburban homes,” even
if these homes were made avail-
able to them.

He conceded that there are
substantial open housing laws on
the state and city books, but that
“there is a problem of enforce-
ment.” He said that many real

Presenting The Drinking Song for Sprite:

"ROAR , SOFT-DRINK, ROAR!"

(_To the tune of "Barbara Fritchie")

 

Traditionally, a lusty, rousing fight song is

de rigeur for every worthy cause and institution.
But we wrote a song for Sprite anyway. We'd like you
to sing it while drinking Sprite, though this may
cause some choking and coughing. So what? It's all in
good, clean fun. And speaking of good, clean things,
what about the taste of Sprite? It's good. It's
clean. However, good clean things may not exactly be
your idea of jollies. In that case, remember that
Sprite is also very refreshing. "Tart and tingling,"
in fact. And very collegiate. And maybe we'd better
quit while we're ahead. So here it is. The Drinking
Song For Sprite. And if you can get a-group together
to sing it—-we'd be very surprised.

Roar, soft drink, roar!

You're the loudest soft drink
we ever sawr!

So tart and tingling, they
couldn't keep you quiet:

The perfect drink, guy,

To sit and think by,

Or to bring instant refreshment
To any campus riot! Ooooooh--
Roar, soft drink, roar!

Flip your cap, hiss and bubble,
fizz and gush!

Oh we can't think

Of any drink

That we would rather sit with!
Or (if we feel like loitering)
to hang out in the strit with!
Or sleep through English lit’ with!
Roar! Soft drink! Roar!
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, SPRITEI

   

SPRITE. SO TART AND
TINGLING, WE JUST COULDN'T
KEEP IT QUIET.

Kilocycles Stunned Into
Submission by Hawks

The Pitt News Hawks are soaring upward and onward. Once again
they have proven that they are tops in the media of communications,
downing the WPGH Kilocycles, 6-0, last Sunday.

' Maintaining their undefeated. untied, and unscored upon record,
the Hawks are waiting in eager anticipation «this week for a post-
season bowl bid. Oﬁfers are expected from the Yellow Journalism
Bowl committee and the Grantland_ Rice Compassion Bowl commit-
5 tee. But most people feel that the Hawks really deserve the biggest
- honor of all, being invited to play in the Westbrook Pegler Sarcasm

Bowl. As captain Tom “Alabama” Sacks says, “That's what we de-

serve the most.”

In Sunday’s game it was all

V blood an’ guts. Too bad he wasn't

there. The contest was more vi-
cious than expected because
everybody was trying to impress
the scouts from the New York
Times, the Washington Post, and
the -Chicago Tribune that were in
attendance. »

The only score came in the sec-
ond quarter when Ralph “Pussy-
whipped” Manning electriﬁed the
Kilocycles with a two-yard run.
The score had been set up on
successive catches by Sacks and
Jay “Flatbush” Rosensteln.

Dan Litchenstein won the
Sleeper award. He was still sleep-
ing at the start of the game. Mike
“Hawk” Brourman won the Sam
Huﬁ fair play award for the sec-
ond straight time. This time for
belting the referee in themouth.
Alan Disler copped the outstand-
ing center award. He was the cen-
tral attraction ’ with the right

Liz plays it in the movie the
Burtons are making in Italy.

A separate agency operating within the defense
establishment, NSA has a critical requirement for:

ENGINEERS. To carry out basic and applied re-
search, design, development, testing and evaluation
of large-scale cryptocommunications and EDP sys-

studies of electromagnetic propagation, upper atmos-

using the latest equipment for advanced research
within the Agency's fully instrumented laboratories.
Career programs are designed to develop the pro-
fessional engineer for a fulland satisfying future in
research or management.

MATHENIATIGIANS. To define, formulateand solve
complex communications-related problems in sup-
