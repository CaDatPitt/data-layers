INVITES LOCALS
T0 XMAS FETE

With a -special G invitation to all
students who will be unable to go
to their homes for the holidays, the
Calvary Episcopal church on Shady
avenue has invited all Pitt men and
women to a Christmas party on De-
cember 24. The affair is scheduled
to begin at 11 o’clock‘in the Cal-
vary house, adjacent to the church,
and will terminate with the regular
midnight service in the church au-
ditorium.

A letter received a few days ago
by Chancellor J. G. Bowman from
Dr.  J. Van Etten, minister, con-
tainsthe invitation:

My Dear Dr. Bowman:
I am venturing to turn

to you

I with a plan we have for this Christ-

Es

    
   
  

  
   
 
 

mas. It occurs to me that there
may be students who for one rea-
son or other cannot go home and
who will ﬁnd themselves more or
less lonesome at Christmas time.

We are planning an informal
party for all the young folks who
come home from school and college
at this season. At 11 o’clock on
Christmas Eve we are going to
have a sort of open house at Cal-
vary House, 311 Shady avenue. We
shall have hot ‘chocolate and other
simple refreshments and then we
are going over to the church for
the midnight service.

I wonder if it would seem to you
in order to extend an invitation to
ny of your students who may care
0 come to this very simple occa-
on held on Christmas Eve? We
all be glad indeed to Welcome all
ose who may care to come.
With appreciation of your kind-
ness, and with all good wishes.

Very sincerely,

Dr. Edwin J.‘ Van Etten,
Minister.

LIDVISES
WIDE READING
FOR STUDENTS .

Noted Author Speaks Before
Large Assembly Crowd

Sinclair Lewis, inventor" of Bab-
bit, “optimist with a little sadness,”
ﬁrst-class reporter and one of the
best writers of present-day Amer-
ica, ‘came to a University assembly
Friday and urged the students to
cultivate intellectual pursuits in or-
der to escape “the awful boredom
of college life.” . .

Speaking before a crowd that
nearly ﬁlled Memorial Hall, Lewis
illustratedhistheme by alluding to‘
some of the most promising. books
of recent years and asking his au-
dience if it had read them. He
named Thomas Mann, Bernard
Shaw, Thomas Hardy, Ernest Hem-
ingway, 'Karl Marx and Marcel
Proust as authors of varying‘ tem-
perament and purpose, typical of
the “free spirits” who have gotten
in touch with reality in the past.
Students unacquainted. with their
works, he maintained, should .not
complain of restraints on civil lib-
erties or freedom of speech. Lewis
then punctured the argument that
students have ,no time, for such
pleasures by asserting that the
boredom of which they complain is
largely due to loaﬁng. -

Roasts Students

Sinclair Lewis opened his speech
by takin out a packet of empty
note car s with the remark, “
laboring man must get out his
tools.” He then thanked God for
the verdict of “Not_ guilty” in the
case of Salvatore Accorsi, and de-
clared he felt as if he were enter-
ing a monastery in coming _to Pitt
from the reality’ of the court room
where the verdict‘ was pronounced.
This led him to complain of A the un-
reality of college life in general and
to “roast” the students, rather than
the faculty, for keeping it up.

He emphasized the ﬁne work“ of
the Theatre Guild in producing
Shaw’s plays and maintained every
student should see them, not for the
good of his soul, that would deprive
professors of their rightful duty, but
for sheer pleasure. He also recom-
mended highlythe Lynds’ “Middle-
town,” a study of the American
middle class for those who want to
know somet 'ng of reality. ‘Thack-
eray's “Vanity -Fai-r’~’=~he "cmentimed.
as a great work that should be read
twice by everyone; before he re-
ceives a college degree, except er-
haps “students of chiropody, ‘p r-
macy and business administration.”

Reveals Secret Longing

Lewis ridiculed that “strange,
nebulous affliction calledgwanting to
write.” The difference . between’
those so afflicted and? professional
writers, he pointed out, is that real
writers do not want to write, they
want to -do- anything else. He con-
ceded, however, that people who
could read Marcel Proust might be-
come successful authors.

The speaker revealed his‘ secret
longing at _one point inshis talk. It
is to write a book sometime with-
out the revolt motif and thereby be
disgraced so that he willnever have
to write any more books.

College life. was boresome to‘ Sin-
clair Lewis. He quit Yale after
three years. because, he could no
longer standgthe restraints. iAfter
a. few years of unsuccessful ‘wander-_
ing, he went. back and took his de-
gree from old Eli.

Blasting Forty Foot flills Common

.Mcn’s Schedules

Engineering students are partici-
pating in co-operative work ranging
from blasting a mammoth hill forty
feet high and changing the course

of a single stream four times in
order to build a direct high-speed

F highway through the hills of West-,

ern Pennsylvania, to testing air-
plane materials and making hang-
ars to nestle giant dirigibles.

E. Willis Whited, in charge of the
co-operative work which every en-
gineering -student is required to
take as a. part of his regular cur-
riculum, says that the jobs this
year seem to be more interesting
and more varied than ever before.

P. Mulheizler, C.E. ’32, is
working as an assistant inspector
for the state’ highway department’
on the new roadway being built be-
tween McKees Rocks and Coraopo-
lis. This job is particularly inter-
esting in that it will necessitate the
building of a concrete bridge forty
feet high, one of the largest bridges
the highway de artment has ever
constructed in t 's section of the
country. and the cutting through
two hills, oneof solid rock, of which
forty feet will have to be blasted
and the other soft sand which will
have; to be dug away. ’

'-In-E-one section of this roadway
the course of a creek was moved,
eliixliilating the building of two
bridges. On another job. near

aviation. .
plant of the Curtiss Aeriéilalle and

Georgetown, on which H. B. Tibbals,
‘CE. .’31, is working, the course of
a single creek had to be moved four

times to save the building of six
bridges.

In Zanesville, Ohio, J. A. McKin-
ley, E.E., '31, isassisting the Ohio
Power Company in building four
electrical sub-stations which will re-
ceive power from the main cross-
country -transmission lines and relay
it to Zanesville. One of these will
be. entirely underground. -

McKinley is making “progress ‘re-
ports” on the job and .15 keeping
cost records and sending them to
the home oﬂice of the‘ Power Com-
pany in Canton, Ohio.

One of the students is assisting V

Stone and Webster, engineers in the
construction of the Cathedral of
Learning. William Druschel, C.E.,
’31, checks the stone‘: work of the
Cathedral as it is -laid to see that
it is level and to see that_- every
stone is put in its proper niche so
that the engineers will not be a
story of stone short when the Cathe-
dral is completed. _ E

J. B. Roman, M.E., ’31, and J. S.
Baird, M.E., ’32, are working on
Roman is at the main

Motor Company, Buffalo, Y., test-
ing all materials that go into the
engines and bodies of airplanes to
make sure they will be able to with-
stand ‘all the strains to which they
will be subjected in the completed

ertson Company who make all the

At its last meeting, with. lll}-_

bers of the .student governing
body took ‘-up the intricate mathe-
matical problem of appropriating
sufficient funds for space in the

After reading the communica-

tion for the Owl which states that
single pages cost $17.50; two
pages with one standard picture
$30, and two pages with compo-
site picture $40,’ Miss Berenice
‘Greer, secretary, placed the con-
tract before the members. .
After serious consideration and
deep investigation~in the matter,
council ﬁnallyhit upon a rate of
$47.50 by adding up the ﬁrst two
rates instead of taking advan-
tage of the $40 rate which covers
their needs. , .
When questioned about the $7.-
50 Christmas present to the Owl,

At a special meeting of the
Uniontown Center student council,
held last Tuesday‘ afternoon, the

to the students was discussed.. Last
year the council body devised an
activity point scale for tlie activities
at Uniontown Center, but with
freshman and sophomores now reg-
istered, the scale was changed at a
meeting of council three weeks ago.

Since the change only six. stu-
dents : are now eligible to. wear ac-
tivitykeys, these students having
earned at least ten activity points,
the minimum required for a key.
-The students, John S. Albright, Her-
man Buck, Thomas‘ B. Cummings,
Samuel Gottesman, E_llis_S1iger and
Mary Frances Woods, will be pre-
sented. with keys designed by stu-
-dent council, with the aid of" the
heads of the various activities last
year,

Before awarding the; key, the
council body discussed at length
what activities of last year would
count points toward an activity
key. 1 Only‘ those activities which
functioned the entire , year were
considered in the‘ awarding of the
keys. Included in the list were:
The Junior Weekly, the official pub-
lication at the Center; basketball,
student.council’,.andE The W. S. G. A.

_ The dramatic" ‘club, chess club. and

intra-mural sports activities were
not included‘ in the list since. these
activities were not’ organized E until
after the beginning. of. the second
semester. . _ * ‘ ’ E E-

‘ The names, of the students eligi-
ble for activity keys were" pre-
sented to Dr. Tesh at the clos.e of
the meeting for his approval. ‘He
approved of the list. ' Several stu-
dents, registered, at Uniontown who
do not have the required number
of activity, points, ‘butwill be eligi-
ble in May, willibe announced‘ at

At a meeting of the‘ deans and administrative officers of the
University on Friday it was recommended that the mid-year con-

_ vocation be held_ Monday, February:*10, rather than on the cus-
tomary February 28, Charter Day. This means that commence-
ment exercises, granting, degrees and the celebration of charter
day will be heldon the earlier date, -February 10. '

Administrative officials were in favor ofthis plan so that grad-
uates will get their degrees almost immediately after their work is
completed and will not be held up

The policeman inthe story made

“came down to earth” he was es-

Until this time, he had refused

night with a Yuletide festival that

 

in respect to attendance. and pro-

gram“ greatly surpassed. a;._ previous

Last night’s festival. consisted of
two distinct parts; a program of
carol singing and Christmas read-
ings in Carnegie Music “Hall, fol-
lowed by three‘ hours of dancing in

audience made up of several hun-
dred undergraduates A and‘ almost an
equal number of parents and
friends of the-students. From -a
beautifully decorated ‘stage in the
center of which stood the huge 30-
foot high pine, resplendent with its
glittering 1 decorations bathed, in a
ﬂood of ,vari-colored, lights, ‘the
program of choral and: orchestral
numbers was -given;  ..  - ~_j-§« E
The program opened with sev-

eral seasonal selections by the Uni-

versity Symphony Orchestra and
the singing of “O, Come All { Ye
Faithful” by the audience. Follow-
ing the innovation, which was de-
livered by Rev. Robert McGown,Tthe
program. was given, over. to carol

glee: clubs and a male quartet. Dr.
W. M. Parrish, head‘ of the depart-
ment of public speaking, concluded
the program A with a reading of

Festival Ends? Semester’:
Glee Club‘ Activities

With its oﬂ“icial- activities of the
first -semester ended at the Yule-
tide Festival last night, the men’s
glee club will not-, practice again un-
til after classes are resumed in Jan-

uary. " Then E, Director ‘Walter H.’

Wright begins intensive practice for
the interco legiate contestto” be held
in February. ’ .

The concert... song which each of
the eight competing Schools‘ will sing
has been chosen, and, according to
Director Wright, will; be “Hark!
Jolly Shepherds!” by Christopher
Morley. The club will soon be work-
ing on that number and also ‘on an
optionalsong which will be an-

’ nounced later. E *

The third song Which the Univer-
sity glee club will present’ will be a
schoolsong of the club’s choice, and
will be thesame as that sung. last

year, a special glee. club’ arrange-H
f ‘ment of _‘

. Hail to Pitt!” -.
Immediately‘ after the ﬁrst 1930
practice, Director ~Wright — will begin
searching for .more ‘capable voices
for the 0 club. Only thirty of the
more than seventy which now com-
pose the organization will. compete
in the intercollegiate’ concert. Thus
the survival of the--. fittest, the
widest-ranged,
voices will prevail in the choral or-
ganization eliminations. .

such a good time last year. Last

policy of mailing no tickets. This
year's committee put its stamp of
approval on that practice by also
omitting tickets. They will be
mailed only on receipt of reserva-
tion card.

Early reservations will lightenthe .

work of the generalcommittee and

partment, but to the. other alumni,
and we are glad to quote from it
this week. I

This June marks the twenty-ﬁfth

ice to the -University. The ,Defpa1'.t-
ment of Chemistry is; planning to
hold a dinner in his honor at. the
University Club. The exact date is
not ﬁxed‘, but it will be near gradu-
ation time in June.‘ Alumni will be
notiﬁed of the exact date at least a‘
month ‘in advance so they canmark
the date on. their calendar and plan
to be there‘. -This will be a real; oc-
It will be a- formal affair
and a ﬁne. oppprtunity for, the. alum-
ni and -the staff to present“Profes-
sor Silverman ~wit_h some token“ as

‘ a mark of their friendship? and-1 ap-

preciation of his twenty-ﬁver’ years
of service.
‘ SAdd To Faculty. i

The faculty of the Chemistry‘ de-
partment now totals ‘forty-seven.

a dinner at the,Facultyi Club on No-
vember 7 to the? undergraduates
specializing in chemistry. There
were eighty-two present and this

Explosives 

BLASTERS’ HANDBOOK  

LL explosives are solids or liquids that can be in-
stantaneously converted by friction, heat, shock,
sparks or other means into large volumes of gas. That
sounds simple, butthisrfundamental principle of the ac-
tion of explosives is modified by a host of circumstances.

First there are “high" and “low” explosives. Then there are all the
circumstances of purpose, methods“ of loadingand ﬁring and han-
dling and storing. Explosives ‘are measured principally by these

eneral characteristics»: Strength, Velocity, Water Resistance
, , nsity, Fumes, Temperature of Freezing. and Length on

Chapter One of th__eBlastcrs? Handbook makes this seemingly com-
plicated subjectvery easily mastered. Charts and tables explain

- relative energy of" different strengths. Other characteristics are
explaiﬁed in classroom.terms, and amply illustrated.

Many of the leading technical colleges, universities and schools _ .,
are using the Blasters? Handbook in their classroom because of

its perfect practicality. Made up by du Pont field service men out

of their own experience in agreat many ﬁelds over a great many
years. The textbook of the “school of experience.”

« While Pitt followers have been

meets last year with the exception
‘f the Ohio State meet. He also

football and swimming this year
._in order to concentrate on track.
Aside from Captain Bowen in

In the jumps, the Panthers are
also fairly well fortiﬁed. Utter-

high. jump and over twenty-two
feet in the broad jump,‘ should win
these two events in a majority of
the meets this spring. Lewis will

In the middle distances the Pan-
thers-- also seem to.be well supplied
with. -good material. Moore, na-
tional A. A. U. cross-country cham-
pion, will run in themile and two-
mile races. Caesar, captain of
next year’s cross-country team, and
“Big Four” two-mile champion}
will~again compete in this special-
ty. Alberta,’ this year's cross-
country captain, will compete in the
half-mile‘, as -will Phillips. Jerpe,
a miler, ‘completes the list.’

‘In the weight events, ‘Pitt will
have Les Cohenof basketball fame,
Montgomery, McMurdo and Tully of
football team, and Knauff, a fresh-
Fman two years ago, who was not
in school last year. Knobloch will
also help these boys along in the
javelin throw.‘ _ '

The pole «vault seems to be the
only big. worry for ‘Coach Shea, as
Utterback is the only veteran vault-
er returning. However, some of the
sophomores‘ may be expected to help
him along. ,

Schedule Arranged .

The.-“first practice sessions for the
freshmen will gbeg-in. after ; the
Christmas holidays. About a month
later the varsity men will report.
They will engage in two indoor
meets during February and March

it will probably be ﬁlled with a
dual meet, with West Virginia.-Orx
May 31, Army will come here, and

‘ on June 7, the boys will compete in

/To Elect Captain

Ten eligible seniors will make the‘

Eddy Baker,: Whitey Walinuhus,‘ Ed-.

men who will serve the; Goldand ,

According to. precedent, a Pitt -
football captain IS usually a senior,
and one who has shown that he has
grit and natural ability to ‘general
‘his. teammates on the field. ,Lubby
Dimeolo has fulﬁlled his task as’,
captain of oneof the greatest teams
in .the history of the University,
with credit? to himself, his team- _
mates and his school. Although
Lubby is a retiring sort of as fol-
low, on the ﬁeld he‘ has prover: to
