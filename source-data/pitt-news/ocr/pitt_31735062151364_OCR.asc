VVith the participation of the Girls’

the first time in .twenty—seven y_ears

as greeted -by a large, en-
thusiastic d appreciative audience,
representi students, alumni and
friends of “the Universityeof Pitts-
burgh. There being -only one night of
this twenty-seventh .annua.l home con-
cert, itlie good seats were taken

program

quickly before the concert and only _\ The program was opened by pay-

a few seats in the much lauded “pea-
nut heaven” were vacant Friday even-
ing.

Every one of the seventeen numbers
was apparently well enjoyed, with a
few standing out even mo-re promi-
nently from the standpoint of applause
received. The readings of Mr. Rey-
nolds and the imitations of Mr. Mar-

while the Glee Quartet, with Messrs.
Marcus, Speck, Reynolds and Wright,
dispelled the glooms in like manner.
Mr. Yardum’s violin received the usual
-app.ro‘b.ation and MT. Este-p’s solo with
Glee Club accompaniment, “VVlien My
Ship Comes Sailing Home,” struck a
note that appealed to every one in the
huge audience. ,

The “Knitting Song” of the Girls’
Glee Club was pronounced “cute and
clever,” and -thecombined Glee Clubs
in “Great Is Jehovah,” was solemn and
impressive. The Mandolin Quintet,
with Godfrey, McMath, Francis, Tea
and Horva-th, offered a number -of’
The Mandolin
Cluib, under the /leadership of Mr.
Godfrey, exhibited a versatile pro-
gram. Director G. L. M'cNemry is to
be -credited with a large part of the
praise for the Mandolin Club, while
H. B. Gaul trained the Glee Club.

The usual policy of giving two num-
-bers in order to eliminate the neces-
-sity of an encore was not changed,
though the men were called Lipon for
encores -several times. ‘

Considerable credit for this concert
and the work of the Musical Clubs
for the entire year will go to the ofﬁ-
cers of the Clubs, including Manager
Anderson. The remaining ofﬁcers
took charge of the work, President

ANNUAL EXI

P. E. P.’S DISPLAYS
VERSATI L I T Y AT
BIT

Group displays of marching, gym-
nastics, apparatus exercises and
dancing featured the annual exhibi-
tion of the Physical Education De-
partment of the School of Education
last Saturday evening. The object of
the exhibition was to show the prac-
tical work done to train the forty
girls of the department for teaching
physical education. The groups were
led by Seniors. The program was
arranged by Professor T. W. Burck-
halter, head of‘ the department.

ing a tribute to the members of the
department who have ‘gone into the
service, by having a group of the
girls carry the service ﬂag around
the gym. This 'was followed ‘by
marching tactics lead by Miss Gr-ace
Gilson. Difficult Swedish gym-nasticsﬁ
led by Miss Janet McDonald and
clever club swinging led by Brenda
Wright displayed the versatility of
the girls.

Interest was stimulated when a
fencing contest by Misses Caroline
Welsh, Nellie Scott, Florence Straus
and Janet McDonald, under the su-
pervision of Miss Blanche Levy, was
given., Games which followed aroused
the spirit of competition among the
co-eds of the two classes, and ‘a. hard-
fought volley ball game in which the
Seniors defeated the Sophomores
amused the .-audience.

Dancing completed the last half of
the program. A group dance in gray
costume led by Miss, Welch and a

.—.folk -$‘dance._‘-led.-Shy-:aM?i&S 

displayed the grace of the partici-
pants. A variation in the program
was offered in two dances by three
children who were coached by Miss
Regina Sexton of the department.
Doris Hasey gave a toe dance re-
quiring balance and execution. A
duet, “Over There,” was .given -by
Dorothy Schar and Robert Held.
Morris dancing in brilliant old Eng-
lish -costunies was well executed by
six girls of the Senior class. The
dance of the Rose Ring and -the

_Tyrolean ‘Trio completed the group

dancing, which was followed by
solo dances. Miss Welch, dancing
“Nagya,” performed well, and Miss
Regina Sexton, dancing “Daisies,”
was forced to give an encore.

The program’ as -a whole displayed
versatility and ability on the part
of the girls. Professor Burckhalter
‘had a well organized program and
the exhibition was run off smoothly.
Social dancing for all those present
finished the program of the evening.

SOCIAL CLUB ’
HOLDS BANQUET

A banquet was held last week -by
the newly reorganized alumni chap-

ter of the Intercollegiate Socialist So-

ciety, of which the Social Science
Club at Pitt is a student chapter, -at
the Seventh Avenue Hotel. There
were ﬁfty present and the principle
speakers of the evening were Pro-
fessor A. B. Wright and Professor
Allan H. Willet of Tech. Speeches
were also given by the students pres-
ent and a lively discussion was con-
ducted on war topics.

Pitt men are taking an active in-
terest in the chapter and the plan is
to have these banquets twice each
month. The officers of the newly or-
ganized chapter are Harry Horlick
of Tech, president; Harry Gerstain,
Ec., ’l7, vice president, and A. Ep-
stein, Ec., ’l7, treasurer.

The weekly meetings of the‘Inter—
national Polity and Social Science
clubs were held last week, and yes-
terday Professor F. Tyson talked on
“Labor and the War” and aroused
some interesting discussion by the re-
marks he made as to what the policy
of labor should be during the war.

SPEAKER AT ,
-ASSEMBLY

The student body was addressed at
the General Assembly on Thursday,
April 4, by Attorney George R. W81-
lace, a member of the Allegheny
County Bar, on the subject, “The
German Menace.” Mr. Wallace ‘brieﬂy
outlined the history of the growth of
Prussian vandalism from the reign of
Frederick the Great down to the
“present time.

“The house of Hohenzollern," he
German,

 

said, “has transformed the
people ‘from a kindly, liberty-loving

race to a nation of -puppets who are

slaves to the will of their monarch."

“We are not ﬁghting the Kaiser or
the German army, but we are bat-
tling against thirty millions of German
people, and the war will not ‘be won
until they are absolutely defeated.”
He told his audience that it is the
duty of the American citizen to back
up the ‘boys at the front by being
willing to make .any sacriﬁce~ne-ces-
sary to the success of the war.

The speaker at tomorrow's Assem-
bly willbe Lieutenant Paul Perigord,

DEBATERS CLOSE
WITH VICTORY

\Vith three defeats and two vic-
tories the Pitt debating team com-
pleted the season. The fellows com-
peted their schedule last week with
a victory over the National Law
School in Vvashington and were de-
feated by State and Juniata. The
co-ed team in the only home debate
of the year were defeated by the
State girls in a close debate.

The debating teams this year were
composed entirely of new material.
The men’s team was -composed of
I. Swiss, E. Fried, W. Nicklas and
H. Jacobson. All of these men had
their first trial at collegiate debating
this year and upheld Pitt against
some of the best teams in the coun-
try. At the National Law School
they were awarded the victory by
two congressmen and a supreme
court judge, who were acting as
judges of the _debate.

The co-ed team was composed of
Mary Thompson, Mollie Davidson,
Dora Breskin and Eva Shamberg. At
the Schenley High School before a
large audience they upheld Pitt on
the negative side of a question which
has been the subject of discussion
by both teams: Resolved, That the
wartime scope of federal regulation
be extended in peace times. Mlost
of the decisions in the debates were
2 to l decisions showing the close-
ness of the contests.

At the tryouts for the annual Civic
Oratorical League’ Contest last week,
James R. Milligan, “College ’l9, was
chosen to represent Pitt at Colgate
this year. He had won a number of
prizes for oratory last year, winning
the annual conte.st for sophomores
and also winning «the Prohibition con-
test. '

WOMEN DISCUSS
VOCATIQN TOPICS

The purpose of the " Vocational
Conference. held .at ‘Wooster, Ohio,
and consisting of the women stu-
dents of Wooster College, the Ad-
visory Board, members of the faculty
and guests, was threefold; (1) to give
all the girls an intelligent insight into
ﬁelds open for women, which they
as college women should have, even
though they do not intend to enter
any of them; (2) to give those about
to teach a knowledge of business
affairs so. that they may be able to
properly advise the children under
their charge; and (3) to give assist-
ance and concrete help to those girls
about to enter upon their careers.
The conference, which lasted ,three
days, was met with such success that
plans are being laid for a similar one
next year. .

Among the topics discussed before
groups of girls were: “The College
Girl in the Factory,” “Social Service
in the_Community, in Business and
in Industry;” “New Occupations
Open to Women on Account of the
\/Var,” “VVornen in Agriculture,” “So-
cial Service as a Function of the
Public School,” “War Work for
Women,” “Settlement Work,” “Sec-
retarial Work,” “Commercial Art,”
“Y. M. C. A. Work,” “The Library,”
“Lunch Roonis,”,“Women in Chem-
istry,” “Nursing.” Several of the
Speakers were from Pittsburgh, in-
cluding Miss Esther Smith of the
Pittsburgh Collegiate Vocational
Bureau, Miss Rose of the Carn\egie
Library School, Miss E. Cornelia
Giddings, head of the Public School
Lunch Rooms, and C. ‘C. Cooper of
the Kingsley House.

Miss Pauline St. Peter of the Em-
ployment Bureau of the University,
who attended the conference, recom-
mends the securing of vocational
guidance for the girls of the Univer-
sity through the appointment of a
woman as Vocational Adviser. Miss

ing of successful men and women of

AN INFORMAL AFFAIR

The Senior dance IS assured! The
Hotel Schenley ballroom is the place
and I/Vednesday evening, May 29, is
the date.
Senior

The General Committee on
Graduation Activities has
ﬁnally decided that a Senior hop is
not only desirable but necessary.

Collegiate work will continue up
until the last day of May, which
makes it impossible for the class of
1918 to have .a May Day, a Class
D3)’, a play, or any of the usual
graduation performances.

The declared itself
unanimously in favor of an informal
Senior Dancein the Hotel Schenley
on May 29. Tickets are $3 per couple.
There was a feeling among some
members of the Committee that this
affair should be restricted to Seniors
only, but inasmuch as there was no‘
Junior Prom this year it is probable
that Juniors will be admitted.

Final action on this matter will be
taken later in the week. Tickets for
the dance will be put on sale Thurs-

committee

day morning through the Committee '4 I

members.

The last general assembly of the
year, to be held on Memorial Day,
will be en_tirelyvin the hands of the

dent William MoClelland will hand

 M A A "SENIOR DANCE, L

V The Seniors have assured an informal dance for May 29th.
 Wniors T especially welcome the news, while the dther classes
"re no less interested in a class that has surmounted many
_ stacles. Handicapped by a shortened term, wholesale de-
dletion» of numbers, conditions imposed by "war, there had been
much doubt as to just how the passing "war class of 1918 could
:'s_ocially cap’ its climactic year in the University. ‘

T It was not doubted that some such event was needed. The . T
group -of .’18 will pass forever from the realms of Pitt as a united

class. A" diploma will be the reward of four devoted years.
*Bu_t back of all the study there lies the memorable and lastiﬂg

‘riendships that have been formed during this short but event- -

11- period. A farewell dance brings all Seniors together .and
;.leave's a tender memento of the pleasure that Alma Mater can

‘re .to,"caI°ry through the life-hardening, future years.

 1;. It. is probable the Juniors will take part in this dance.

here are numbers of reasons for the ﬁtness of such action.

hooves tennis men to announce their
intentions at once. T

These men ‘should hand their name
to Mr. Miller at his office in Trees

the coaches. , T ,

An excellent schedule is, in pros-

J. M. VS/allace, a graduate student

follows: 7

“Before it was ﬁnally decided if I
should be commissioned in the Ord-
nance Department, an Order was is-
sued stating that no further commis-
sions were to be given to men Of draft
age unless they had ﬁr'st' had training
camp experience. Immediately after
I learned Of this policy I applied for
induction into the ordnance service
and requested -that I be sent'to an
‘ordnance training school similar to
that at the University of Pittsburgh.
I was sent to the Frankford arsenal
and was there until I received my
assignment to Penn State. When I
left Washington I was in the ordnance
production department as office man-
ager in the trench warfare branch.”
