UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH ‘ ~

Asst. News Editor

Things were not as expected

‘when Pitt student Lori Marsh

moved into her 409 Oakland Ave.
apartment last September.

“When we first moved in, there
was a cat sitting on mycouch
because the kitchen window was
jammed open, and we couldn't
shut it,” she said. “We walked
into the bedroom and started
moving furniture, and our desk
crumbled at our touch. Then we
noticed that our outlet was
popping out of our wall; we didn’t
have a kitchen table or chairs. We
had a hole in our wall; our
showerhead was green. It still is
green.”

Also worried about a crack in
her living room window that
worsened with changes in the

‘weather, Marsh said that Charles

J. Greve and Co. Real Estate, the
company she and her fiance, C}.
Wright, rent from, was anything
but quick to respond.

“We kept calling and calling,”
said Marsh, “but it was three
weeks before somebody came to
fix it.”

That wasn’t the only time Marsh
has experienced a maintenance
delay. . ‘

“We had water running directly
into our bathroom electrical
outlet,” she said. “It took them a
whole week to fix it. They told
me that restoring heat to the
building next door was more

important than water running into .

my socket.”

Last month, after reaching her
last straw with Greve and Co. and
concerned for the safety of both
herself and Wright, Marsh decided

~ to take further action.

“We decided that we were fed
up with trying to call him when
nothing was getting done. So I
called the health inspector and
the building inspector.” On Jan.
51, Marsh, along with Brad Stein,
who also lives in her building,
held a meeting so that tenants
could be informed of what actions
they could take. Approximately

-20 tenants attended.

The next day, a group of tenants
took a broken bannister from
their building’s main stairway and
set it in Greve’s office, demanding
that the maintenance problems
be fixed.

“I think they were shocked

that we did that,” Marsh said,’

“but they had to know how
infuriated weare at this situation.”

Marsh said she wanted other
tenants to know what steps she
took because “I didn’t think that
I could do anything about it
because I am a student, and if he
takes me to court, I will have no
money to fight him; but I do have

the right to a clean, safe
apartment.
“I want students to get

informed; there is stuff that you
can do. I don’t think that most
students know that,” she added.

As a result of her complaints,
Marsh’s apartment was inspected
and declared unfit for habitation
by the Allegheny County Health
Department, according to
information officer Guillermo
Cole.

“The tenants [Marsh and Wright]
have no ventilation in their
bathroom, and there is a small
hole in the ﬂoor,” Cole said.
“There is also a receptacle
hanging out of a baseboard, and
some windows in the apartment

are unopenable.”

Other possible health hazards
were found throughout the
building, such as missing stairway
bannisters, broken light switches
and electric violations. Cole added
that the building’s water heater in
the basement is missing a “drip
tube” which deflects water to the
ﬂoor in the case of a malfunction.

“If the pressure relief valve
breaks, boiling water will spurt
straight up; someone could get
burned on the face,” Cole said.

Greve and Co. has until March
5 to fix the violations or court
action will be taken. I

The company also has 30 days
to correct four violations found
by Dan Feeney, an Allegheny
County building inspector who
inspected Marsh’s building. They
are as follows:

-Greve and Co. must provide
self-illuminated exit signs.

-Emergency lighting for the
entire building must be installed.
“The way things are now, in the
event of a fire, the building would
be very dark,” said Feeney.

-The “rear dwelling units” --
apartments that to enter, tenants
must walk through another
apartment’s hallway — must be
renovated so that tenants have
direct access to the “fire tower”
or main hallway. “If there was a
fire in the front apartment, they
might have a hard time getting
out,” said Feeney. He added that
this correction may be difficult
since the front-dwelling
bathrooms are located off the
hallway and may have to be
knocked out.

-Greve and Co. must make

sure that no furniture is blocking
the entrance to the rear stairs
from back dwelling units. “It is
the landlord’s responsibility to
tell tenants what they can or
cannot‘ do through contractual
agreements,” Feeney said.
David Greve, owner of Greve

and Co., said that he will fix any I

violations the inspectors order
him to. In fact, Greve said that he
has already started the repairs.
However, he cannot understand
the problems tenants cited with
his maintenance service, since it
operates “24 hours a day, seven
days a week. I have an answering
machine that answers the phone.”

But some students disagree.

Posvar says Pitt, not alone in budget crisis, hiring freeze

By Jennifer Calabrese

Staff Writer

Pitt isn’t alone in the financial problems
that have pushed the university into a
hiring freeze, according to President Wesley
Posvar.

“In the larger perspective, other state
universities are in this same situation
because throughout the United States,
particularly the north eastern United States,
state-government revenues have fallen
sharply in the last 12 months. That means

I that lschools like] Ohio State and Michigan

are in great difficulty, many of them much
worse than ours,” Posvar said, as he
addressed the meeting of the University
Senate Council last night.

“Rutgers [University] in New Jersey has
been in a total hiring freeze in which [it is]
now going into [its] second year. So the
competition is suffering from some of the
same ailments that we are. That isn’t much

consolation, but it is important to
remember,” he said.

University Senate Presidentjames Mauch
responded to the vote of no confidence
regarding the hiring freeze that the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences gave Posvar last week
during his address to the council.

“After speaking to many of the faculty
members over the phone about these
recent events, I would have to say that
they concur basically with the views that
the chairs expressed,” he said.

Mauch announced two resolutions, that
the Faculty Assembly passed last week,
which criticized the administration for
instituting the freeze at such a critical time
in the recruitment year, urged the
administration to reconsider the hiring
freeze, and asked them to implement
planning processes that would include the
faculty to prevent a future freeze.

“My impression now, which has been
greatly enhanced by his report, is that

there are real problems of communication
and understanding,” Posvar said.

Posvar also responded to inquiries about
funds that the university is spending on
new projects.

“In respect to auxiliary enterprises, the
notion that building dorms, for example,
or building a big parking garage represent
resources that can be rechanneled in
academic programs, is false. Those are
auxiliary enterprises that have revenue
streams that are funded by capital provided
by tax—exempt bonds,” he said.

“The dorms and the garage are
investments; they are investments in
quality, and they are not in competition
with academic programs.”

Posvar said that he has also received
criticism about ‘expenditures in public
relations.

“People referred to the Chautauqua
conference. Well, that conference did cost
us about $100,000, butwe received literally

millions of dollars worth of good publicity
throughout the United States and
elsewhere. [Public relations] is a good
investment and Chautauqua was a fantastic
bargain,” he said. I

In other business at the meeting, Student
Government Board Presidentjulie Shepard
reported that SGB is making progress in its
involvement with the development of the
new dorm.

“From the student aspect, we will be
keeping on our part. We received a survey
which Facilities Management had taken,
also concerning what students‘ thought
about the new residence hall, and we will
be looking into that, hopefully before that
residence hall is far enough along that
everything is pretty stringent within it,”
she said.

She also reported that the SGB will be
donating over $1,000 to help an expansion
project of the weight room in Trees Hall.

‘Video art‘ shows history of CMU protests

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

Inside the Turmoil Room, a
Wilkinsburg pizzeria turned
alternative art studio, the history
of civil disobedience at Carnegie
Mellon University was recounted
by way of “video art."

The video, “No Victory Without
a Battle,” was shown on Sunday.
It mixed a documentary style with
a constant repetition of scenes to
recount four rallies against CMU’s
Software Engineering Institution
which were led by local protestor
Vincent Scotti Eirene over a two-

year period, 1987-89. He protested
there to show his distaste for the
nuclear- arms race and for the
institute’s contracts with the U.S.
Department of Defense.

The movie was created by Rick
Fishkin, producer of Peace TV,
which airs on PCTV channel 21.
Peace TV tapes peace rallies and
shows them in documentary form.

“We are an alternative to the
mainstream media which
represents the status quo,” Fishkin
said.

Fishkin makes no money from
Peace TV nor will he from this art
show. He supplies all of the money

for video production by
videotaping weddings and other
occasions for friends.

Despite the fun he has
videotaping protests, he said he
often becomes depressed due to
the lack of his success.

“Peace work is tough. You work _

and work and work and give 100
percent, and get almost nothing
in retum. This small turnout shows
this,” he said, referring to the
number of people who came to
Sunday’s showing.

“Being a peace worker is like
being a vegetarian amongst
Cannibals,” Eirene added.

At each of the rallies, Eirene
either got arrested or received a
citation for acts of civil
disobedience. The video shows
scenes such as Eirene being
dragged off by Pittsburgh Police
for acts like chaining himself to
the front doors of the institute.

He compares himself with other
civil-disobedience advocates such
as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and
Gandhi. He compares his cause
of fighting against the arms race
with theirs, stating during the
narrative, “Throughout history
there has never been a victory
without a battle.”

Continued from page 3

Brant and Mast said they
immediately called Greve and
Co.’s 24-hour answering service
starting around 6 p.m. and
continued calling every hour,
stopping at 2 a.m. No help arrived.

“We called again the next
morning,” Mast said. “Finally, they
came about an hour later. By
then, even our bathtub was
flooding.”

Brant, Mast and their roommate
Carol Kinlough said they have
had several maintenance
problems during the two years
they have rented from Greve and
Co. Many times, they have had to

wait days before getting a

response —— if there is one —— said
Kinlough, adding that it took
nearly two years for a pane of

glass in their kitchen door to beg
replaced. They are currently’

complaining about their ceiling,
which is starting to fall through.
Brant also said that the toilet of
the tenants above them is partially
visible through the ceiling of I
their apartment. “I’m scared it’s
going to fall through and hurt
someone someday,” she said.

When informed about the
ceiling, Greve said that perhaps
it was caused by students as
many maintenance problems are.

“Kids bring kegs into
apartments,” he said. “Maybe one
fell through the ﬂoor. I have no
idea.”

Another tenant, George
Yingling, said that the heat in his
apartment did not work for nearly

V a month. He said he continuously

complained, but Greve “told me

that were more important."
However, Greve said he has no
record of Yingling’s requests.
Although Marsh and Wright
are satisfied that some of their
problems will be rectified via the
inspectors’ reports, they are
angered that they had to resort to
those measures and said they
would never consider renting
from Greve and Co. again.
They added that they do feel
their meeting was successful
though since tenants got a chance
to voice their complaints, which
ranged from heating problems to

security concerns. For example,
Stein said that his key to the
outside door also works in the
front doors of four neighboring
buildings that belong to‘Greve.

“We all know to get promises
in writing. This is my first
apartment; I’m a student; I just
didn’t know any better,” said
Marsh.

Greve does not understand
why the meeting was necessary.

“Did they complain in writing?
They always have the option to
see me personally or write me,”
he said. “People complain all the
time; that’s part of the real-estate

But some students don’t think
they should have to take the time
out of their busy schedules to
write letters or to visit Greve.

“We’re students, and we just
don’t have the time to keep on
them, ” Mast said. “We’ve resigned
ourselves to believe that that’s
the way it is; things won’t get
changed. We used to be livid. ”

“I’ve had to miss work and
classes to get this done,” said
Marsh. ‘‘I shouldn’t have to do

that."

Apparently some students are
taking action against Greve.
Although he could not be specific,
Mark Galzerano, legal adviser to
Pitt students, said, “There are
definitely complaints made
against many of the largest
landlords in Oakland. Some
names do come up more
frequently than others, and I can
say that [David Greve’sl name
comes up quite regularly.”
Galzerano added that nearly 80
percent of the complaints he deals
with concern landlord-tenant
problems.

japan zeroing in on Moon

Though there is no doubt that Japanese technology is
booming at a rate competitive with modern U.S. technol-
ogy, Americans should pause to carefully take note of a
Japanese first that occurred a few weeks ago,

Japan recently became the third nation after the United
States and the Soviet Union to launch an unmanned
rocket to the moon. Japanese scientists are confidently

I optimistic. that the launch will mark a turning point in

Japan’s halting space program. a

Now, thislaunch does prove that Japan’s technology is
indeed increasing for the better. But it also proves that
perhaps.Americans have been a bit too paranoid over the
so-called Japanese “threat.” ' I ‘
» The nati.on._ofJapan, whose technological and econorni-

cal prowess has caused anxiety among conventionally

complacent Americans, is not as advanced as we think ‘--
at least not in the areaof space exploration, where the
United States still reigns supreme. After all, one might
have thought that this economic and technological super-
power would have launched a rocket to the moon a while
ago. (Perhaps a reason why they haven’t is because post-
World/War II restrictions by the United States on Japanese
financial contributions to military production has prohib-
ited them from conducting research in missile-and projec-
tile—related-defense: the typeof research which leads to
space designs and accomplishments.)

However, what ‘is interesting is that Japan’s space
program may quickly begin to blow away the economi-
cally deficient and defaulted Soviet Union. This recent
Japanese space achievement will probably be the catalyst
for that accomplishment. Henceforth, leading to a situ-
ation in which Japan will become the United States’ new,
top space competitor -4 replacing the Soviet Union — in
the world theater, a scenario which will certainly spawn
even more hostilities between the always-rivaling United
States and Japan. I I ,

One must also wonder whether, given the almost
nonexistent condition of the Soviet economy, the dreamy
joint U.S.-Soviet-manned mission to Mars will turn into a
U.S.-Japan one before it’s all over. Considering the rapid
counter-directions of the Japanese and Soviet economic
positions, that idea doesn’t sound too far—fetched. ,

It would be quite refreshing to see these two countries,
who bombed and warred with one another in World War
II, take planet Earth into the second millennium with a
joint, friendly mission into our solar system.

I \\
Matt Martin /5;  .
Editor in Chief   :; « Q92,/I  ..-=~ \\ L/‘Z,

The major news media is al-
ways talking-about the Japanese.
Japanese investment, Japanese
purchases of American—owned
businesses and the U.S. trade
deficit are common issues. The
general feeling portrayed by the
news media is one of fear. Japan
is investing lots of money and
buying lots of businesses. Ameri-
cans are buying cars, stereos and

.other Japanese goods. Some

news sources say that these things
are bad for our nation. But they
are wrong. Japanese activity in
the United States is not bad for
our economy. If anything, it is

I good.

Japanese investment helps our
economy. Goods and services
are produced. Jobs are also cre-
ated.

American imports ofJapanese-
manufactured goods is an inter-
esting topic. From the surface,
one sees that when Americans
buyJapanese cars, American jobs
are destroyed in the industry of
car manufacturing. However, in
a free market, jobs will pop up in

other areas. For example, for-

eign imports have helped in the
growth of the service sector of
our economy. Whether it be real
estate, accounting firms, retail
sales or fast-food restaurants, the
number of jobs in the service

sector has been increasing quite
rapidly. Furthermore, competi-
tion from Toyota encourages Ford
to improve the quality of its cars.

All of this increases our standard
of living.

Many years ago, modern farm

equipment put millions of farm-
ers out _of work, but new jobs
appeared, and our standard of
living went up. Imports of Japa-
nese goods do the same thing.
Foreign manufacturing aids in
the specialization of labor. If

  Daniel
  Alman .

somebody else can produce
something better and/ or cheaper
than I can, it makes sense that I
would buy it from them. It would
be a waste-for me to grow my
own bananas when I can get
them cheaper elsewhere.

Another issue is the buying of
American businesses by Japa-
nese firms. Some people are
alarmed at this, but I am not. If a
buyer and seller -freely decide to
engage in such activity, both of
them benefit. Just because the
buyer is from another country
does not mean that any harm will
come.

The Japanese government has
many trade barriers against the
importing of U.S. goods. Some
Americans want our government
to retaliate by doing the same
thing. That would not be right.
The Japanese restrictions hurt
the United States and Japan.
Further restrictions could only
increase the harm to both of us.

‘ England has always invested

a Nothing to fear from Japanese

more money in the United States
thanjapan has. Until very recently,

.52,‘

so have the Dutch. We don’t '

usually see a lot of people
screaming in fear of those
countries. This causes’ me to
suspect that it is not just a question
of economics that so many people
are dealing with. Could it be a
touch of racism? ’
Why are Americans so afraid of
the Japanese? Could it have
something to do with the second
World War? If so, such fears are
completely irrational. Today’s
Japanese investors are not
responsible for the attack on Pearl
Harbor- That was half a century
ago.’ The people responsible for
World War II are long dead.
If anything, having free trade

between the United States and
. Japan should increase good will

between our countries. The
Japanese have such a strong
interest in us that they-. would be
crazy to attack us.

Presently, U.S. corporations
engage in business activity with
England, the Netherlands, France,
‘Canada, Australia, West Germany,
Sweden, Mexico, Switzerland and
many other countries. It is very
rare for any of these nations to be
criticized for such activity. The
Japanese, on the other hand, are
hated by many Americans.

Racism, in any form, is" bad
news. “Japan-bashing,” as it has
been called, is becoming more
and more common. This worries
me.

Ya see, like I totally have these

problems picking up guys, It’s
like my nails aren’t right, or you
know, something like that. I’ve
been to all the frat mixers onthe
hill and like fer sure, the guys
aren't digging me. Like I know
it’s not bad breath. Susie told me
my breath was OK. But like,
you’re cool, what kind of things
do dudes like, you know, what

can I do to get dates and stuff?

Well, Hot and Bothered, you

Dear

Diamond

scream, “Hey You!” to the guys.
Try to add at least two feet to the
bigness of your hair. If it’s only
two feet bushy now, make it four,
if it’s only four feet bushy now,

make it six. Guys like big. Also

wear little outﬁts that match, from
the socks all the way up to the
earrings. Then you’ll be ready to
try your prowess with the men.
Go for guys who are fair-to-mid-
dling at first; as this will give you
the experience you need when
you want to take on the high
rollers. Maybe buy some new leg
hosiery; it always helps. And try
this pick—up line, “How about
