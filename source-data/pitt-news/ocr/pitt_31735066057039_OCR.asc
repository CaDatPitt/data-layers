Sexually abused by grandfather before the age of 5,
gangyraped at 18, raped by best friends husband at 19,
raped by the latter and ex—boyfriend together at 19,
attempted assault by stepfather at 20 and raped by hus-
band at 27.

This is not a random list of sexual abuses against
women. This is one woman’s diary of sexual abuse.

Foity—six-year—old “Sally,” speaking with a quivering
yet strong voice, listed one by one the sexual abuses
she has endured.

As she read, many of the nearly 500 people —— sit-
ting, kneeling, lying and standing — in the stulfy City
Council chamber, shook their heads in disbelief as
“Sally” unfolded her life.

She was a small but powerful part of Friday night’s
Take Back the Night demonstration, which featured
local musicians, other abuse survivors and a march that
lit up several Downtown blocks.

The procession of men, women and children
marched along sections of Wood Street, Forbes
Avenue and Grant Street, continuing into the City-
County Building.

Armed with ﬂashlights and escorted by city police,
the marchers, far fewer than in the 2,000—strong ‘89
Take Back the Night, were still able to make their
point.

“One, two, three, four, we won’t take it anymore,”
the group chanted, while some waved their lists. 0

Pittsburgh residents Deanna Nilsson and Susan
Wind, both survivors of sexual abuse, held hands tight-
ly as they sat on the ﬂoor “Indian style” a few feet from
“Sally.”

They, too, spoke openly about their abuse, particu-
larly their frustration of having nowhere to tum for
help.

“There wasn’t much to do lback thenl,” said Nilsson,
who was raped as a young adult in 1970, years before
any rape crisis center or counseling services were
established in Pittsburgh. ‘ ~

It wasn’t until three years after the rape that Nilsso
had enough courage to speak to anyone outside her
immediate family about the traumatic incident. She
broke her silence to classmates in a recently formed Pitt
Women’s Studies course.

Campus Women’s Organization co-President Jenna
Fenara, who helped organize the event, was thrilled
with the turnout despite the drizzling, cold Friday

ing Friday night's Take Back the Night march.

By Jason Hillman
Editor in Chief

Gov. Robert P. Casey
headlined the big names
from the University of
Pittsburgh, state and
local governments that
got together last Friday to
officially open PitI’s new
Center for Biotechnology
and Bioengineering.

“I can’t think of a more
powerful symbol of the
transformation of the
economy of Western
Pennsylvania than what
we witness here today,”

Casey said.
The center, which
encompasses 80,000

square feet, was built
through a $14 million
grant from the state
Department of General

Services and is expected
to house 60 to 100 scien-
tists, engineers and clini-
cians.

“This ceremony today
is a real symbol of the
brigly skies that are
ahead for all of us in
Pennsylvania,” Secretary
of General Services
David L. Jannetta said.
“Because today we’re
bringing together state
officials, local officials
and university officials to
open the door to
Western Pennsylvania’s
technological future.”

The center is located
on Second Avenue, on
property that used to be
an unoccupied steel mill
and is part. of the
Pittsburgh Technology
Center, a research park

that will also house a
structure for Carnegie
Mellon University.

“It’s a wonderful feel-
ing to have this occasion
happen,” Director and
Chief Scientist of the cen-
ter Dr. Jerome Schultz
said. “I’m very pleased
that were going to have
some excellent research
groups from the universi-
ty from several different
disciplines working
together in this facility in
a truly interdisciplinary
fashion.”

Many of the speakers
at the ceremony praised
the “partnership” that
worked toward the cre-
ation of the center.

“The university, and
indeed the larger com-
munity, is appreciative

and absolutely delighted
to have this center,”
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor said.
Chairperson of the
Allegheny County
Commissioners ..,.Tom
Foerster mentioned for-
mer Mayor Dick Caligiuri
and his ideas about revi-
talizing the region.
“When his untimely
death occurred, I guess
there was a little debate
as to how we should
memorialize Dick
Caligiuri. The majority
opted for the statue,
which is fine. I guess in
my judgement, but I was
outvoted, I wanted this
technology center to be
named after him. I can’t
help but think that one
of his visions has been

fulﬁlled,” Foerster said.

Dr. Schultz said that a
graduate program in bio-
engineering, jointly
sponsored by the School
of Engineering and the
Medical School, has been
started.

"“Today we sit at the
apex of a world-class
center to which the
entire world literally is
looking for guidance,
hope and progress in the
future,” Casey said. “And
it’s nice to know that
lives are going to be
saved by reason of what
happens in this facility.
And hope is going to be
given to people who
never had it before. For
better lives and longer
lives. And more produc-
tive lives.

Follefestioal hrings local
Latin Americans and
Carriheans together

By Steve Kozarovich
For The Pitt News

.The first floor of Forbes

'Quad was alive with the

sights and sounds of Latin
America and the
Caribbean on Saturday.

The 14th Annual Latin
American and Caribbean
Folk Festival is spon-
sored every year by the
Center for Latin American
Studies and the University
Center for International
Studies.

.“lt’s a chance for Latin
Americans in the area to
come together and cele-
brate our history and for
others to see our culture
firsthand instead of just
reading about it in text-

books,” said former
Pitt student Ron
Gonzalez. "

Nine hours of food,
dancing and culture were
on hand for all those who
were interested in experi-
encing the vibrant cul-
tures of Brazil, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Cuba, Peru,
Venezuela, Mexico,
Puerto Rico and many
others.

“I’m from Latin America
and I heard about this
through the Center for
Latin American Studies,”
Pitt student Jamie
Lawrence said.

“I wanted to experience
the other cultures, and I

especially wanted to hear.

believes to be the truth

By Phyliss Milligan
Staff Writer

Writing ‘can be many
things. A source of great
happiness, an instigator
of change and a voice for
those who cannot speak
for themselves.

For Maryse Condé, writing
represents a responsibility to
say what you believe to be
the truth.

Condé was one of
the speakers at a mini-con-
ference held last Saturday

entitled “Gender Rep-
resentation in African,
African-American and

Caribbean Literature.”

Also included in the con-
ference was Marita Golden,
author and founder of the
African-Americans’ Writer’s
Guild and Uzoma

Esonwanne, author, critic
and English professor at the

. Titttha,

University of Maryland.

The conference was spon-
sored by five campus groups
and departments.

Conference organizers
invited students from litera-
tureclasses to read papers
they had written based on
the authors’ novels.

Students were able to
get feedback from the
authors on their interpreta-
tions of characters and story-
lines.

Condé, a native of
Guadeloupe, an island in the
French West Indies, is also
the author of several play
and six novels. '

Her works include I,
Blacle Witch of
Salem, for which she was
awarded the Grand Prix
Littéraire de la Femme, and
Tree of Life, for which
she was awarded the French

What's up with SEAC

last week at the last Student Government Board-sponsored forum, sev-
eral student groups came out to express their concerns to Chancellor
O’Connor and other top—level administrators. Among the more vocal
groups that spoke out was the Student Environmental Action Coalition.

SEAC has mobilized in full force, trying to force the O’Connor adminis-

tration to retreat from the Mt. Graham Telescope Project. The mountain is

-home to an endangered species and is considered sacred to the Apaches

who live there.

Thus far, according to members of SEAC, most of the institutions that ’

considered funding the telescope have withdrawn — including Harvard,
the Smithsonian Institute and NASA. Although O’Connor did not give
names, he mentioned the possibility of several other institutions participat-
ing in the project. SEAC vehemently denied it, however, and said that only
Pitt and the University of Arizona remain.

O’Connor and SEAC seem to be at a stalemate. O’Connor has said that a
decision has yet to be made on the project and that all other options are
being carefully explored. SEAC simply wants O’Connor to state that Mt.
Graham is no longer under consideration and that the telescope will be
built at another site. ‘ ’

As it stands, there are 58 continental sites that were determined by the
National Optical Astronomy Observatories to be superior to the Mt.
Graham site. The question of “Why Mt. Graham” still has yet to be ade-
quately answered by the university. '

But while we agree with SEAC, . and think that O’Connor should choose
an alternative sight for the telescope, the group’s actions could prove
counterproductive if its members of are not careful.

At the forum, the members of SEAC showed a blatant disregard for
Chancellor O’Connor and made misinformed comments like “we hired
you as chancellor’ and “we pay your salary.” Both comments, which, by
the way, were made by CMU student Josh Knauer, have to make you
wonder whether these students are interested in protecting the Apache
Indians or if they have an ulterior motive to their actions. '

Trying to tie O’Connor’s hands will only make the goals of SEAC more
difficult to attain. As much as O’Connor wants to make the right decision,
he also does not want to be shown up and embarrassed if he has to back
down. ' '

As a university and student organization that believes firmly in the prin-
ciple of “cultural diversity,” we hope both Pitt and SEAC remember what is
at stake here. That is, of course, if both groups are committed to what they
preach. - .

Empowering women

One in six female students will be sexually assaulted or raped sometime
during her fourryears at Pitt. This past Friday night, some 300 women
marched along sections of Downtown to speak out against a society that
they feel exploits them. It’s called Take Back the Night. .

The real—life stories were tenifyingly grim. One 46-yearold woman was
sexually abused by her grandfather before the age of three, gang raped at
18, raped by her best friend’s husband at 19, raped by the latter and her
ex-boyfriend together at 19, attempted assault by stepfather at 20, and
raped by her husband at 27.

Listening to other women talk about their experiences puts faces to the
headlines and tears to the ﬁve-second news blurbs. But to an outsider,
mention of this type of night may seem nothing more than symbolic. It
will take a lot more than a march of 300 women to stop men from raping
and treating women as objects.

But, like the Civil Rights Movement, which was an impetus for the

' young black men and women of America to continue their struggle

against inequality, nights like this one will keep the injustices against
women in the forefront of people’s minds.

Most importantly, when 300 people meet together and share one
anothers experiences, it leaves these women with a tremendous sense of
empowerment and hope.

Three cheersfor Pitt Greek systeml

No one seems to know where
the notion that “all kids are bad”
developed, but it is a stigma that
has followed young people
through the generations. This phi-
losophy is not only mistaken, but it
does not apply when one consid-
ers the contributions of the young
men and women in the University
of Pittsburgh’s Greek community.

These fraternity and sorority
members have been spending their
spare hours volunteering at

A Pennsylvania Special Olympics

events throughout the region, help-
ing mentally challenged athletes
enrolled in the program improve
their lives through training and
competition in sports. The brothers
and sisters have staffed Special
Olympics fund-raising events, in
addition to sponsoring campus and
community—wide blood drives for
the Central Blood Bank.

Fraternities and sororities have
been long been associated with
drunken parties, mischief and
snobbish attitudes. The Pitt Greeks
have put those misnomers to rest
with their dedication to others,
above self.

The issue is lost

Joseph Noroski’s letter in the
March 30 edition of T19ePitt-Neus
exemplifies the reasons why the
abortion issue will not be settled in
America any time soon. The “main-
stream” pro-choice and pro-life
movements have gotten so
entrenched in their traditional
rhetoric that they cannot talk ratio-
‘ ell how can we talk rationally
to closed-rninded bigots?’

“Well how can we talk rationally
to baby-killers?"

You can just see these statements
coming from the two groups. Mr.
Noroski’s letter is perfect for show-
ing this. He says of his pro-life
friends that, “Etery pro-life friend I
know is a compassionate, rational
person dedicated to family and

life.” He refers to the entire pro-

choice movement as, “These radi-
cal, anti-family, anti—chjld, anti-men
feminists.”

The truth of the matter is that
there are good people and bad
people on both sides of the issue,
both of whom should be admired
for their convictions but not neces-
sarily their tactics, who simply have
different philosophical positions.
The same could be said for most
controversial issues. The problem is
that name—calling and polarization
tend to suppress intelligent, rational
discussion of issues.

And it is intelligent, rational dis-

cussion, not slogans and name-call-
ing, that produce solutions.

Mr. Noroski also referred to The
Pitt News’ editorial staff as “pinko
comrnies.” Sadly, there used to be a
time in this country [someone]
could be persecuted because of
alleged communist ties. Nowadays,
such tactics only make the accuser
look stupid. McCarthyism is dead,
hopefully political name—calling will
soon follow.

C'mon tell the truth

Cameron Harveys “eirlitorial” in
Thursday’s Pitt Aews, appropriately
entitled “Wondering about who the

victim is,” presents us with a prime

example of the bankruptcy of reac-
tionary rhetoric indicative of the
“Perspective” page opinion
columns. So far as we can tell,
Harvey’s thesis goes something like
this: “White straight men have had
some privileges as a ‘majority’
group, but now that they are ‘los-
ing’ majority status they are being
picked on by evil ‘minority special
interest groups” (like women who
comprise 52 percent of the popula-
tion).

Harvey tells us that Fred
Johnson, a high school graduate
and a fine, upstanding white
straight guy, lost his job at a local
steel mill to a college educated
woman because of evil machina-
tions of “affirmative action.-” Let’s
see  Fred is called into his boss’
office and told that he is no longer
able to work there because the mill
wants a totally unqualiﬁed worker
who (by virtue of her educational
status) demands a higher wage
from the company and will require
company resources to train her.
Does this sound unlikely? It is
unlikely because it just doesn’t hap-
pen that way.

Aifrrmative action programs are
meant to deal with prejudicial hir-
ing practices which preclude jobs
from being properly advertised to
qualified minority candidates. No
one is fired because of aliinnative
action programs.

Could we have a different ver-
sion of the situation illustrated by
Harvey’s Fred Johnson story? Of
course, lets try this: After 20 years
experience working in a local steel

mill, Fred Johnson, who happens '

to be straight, white and male, is
ﬁred because his union no longer
holds any clout and he, therefore,
has no redress aginst the compa-
ny. The -company knows that Sue
Jamison is willing to work for the
newly downgraded (non-union)
pay scale at the plant You see, Sue
is young, has no family to support
and, like her other college educat-
ed peers‘(white and black, male
and female, gay and straight) Sue
has not been able to ﬁnd a high-
skill, high-wage job. So, after look-
ing for months, Sue takes a job she
doesnotreallywantandforwhich
she is not fairly compensated

The company saves money (no
spouse or children on the health
plan, no union scale wages, etc.)
and the workers justifiable anger is
direaed toward those “self-serving”
minority groups. Who are the vic-
tims and victimizers in this sce-
nario?

Baseball cools off St. John's, wins two

By Cory Walborn
and Tom Schneider
The Pitt News

Looking at the St. John’s
baseball team yesterday con-
jured up images of a polar
expedition. With their big red
parkas and thick ski gloves,
the players seemed prepared
for the harsh weather.

However, they evidently for-
got to prepare for a baseball
game.

While their bodies may have
been warm, their bats were ice
cold and Pitt was red hot. ,

Using two stellar pitching
performances, timely hitting
and fantastic defense, the
Panthers beat the Redmen 2-0
and 4-2 in a doubleheader
sweep at Trees Field yester-
day.

Panther starting pitchers Bill
Junker and Jason Rakers scat-
tered seven hits and two runs
over 15 and two-thirds innings
while striking out 16 batters,
stymieing an inconsistent St.
John’s offense. This was an
offense that led the Big East in
batting last season.

“Both pitchers threw
extremely well,” St. John’s
head coach Joe Russo said.
“Both threw strikes, controlled
and moved the ball around
and mixed speeds well.

“We didn’t adjust well to
pitches at all "today, and it is
one of the worst offensive out-
ings we have had,” Russo said.

“We thought we had an idea
on how we could get their hit-
ters out,” Pitt head coach Mark
Jackson said. “The key is
pitchers throwing to spots. I
thought both of them were
able to get their off—speed
pitches over. You can’t contin-
ually throw fastballs to a team
like that and hope to get away
with it.”

Much of the Panther offense‘

was provided by second base-
man Brad Reese. Reese led the
Panthers with three hits,
including a solo home run,
while driving in two runs and
scoring one himself. First

T-Vfreez _
 R unbelievable  inning  

: ‘gr. Ezolcl   B if

, baseman Jason Roth also con-

tributed with two hits, driving
in two runs.

The Pitt defense, led. by
shortstop Danny Gonzalez,
did not let the choppy infield
disrupt its concentration.
Committing only two errors
and turning in countless out-
standing individual plays, the
Panther defense kept the
Redmen bottled up.

“We played good defense all
the way around,” Jackson
said. “Danny [Gonzalez] made
some nice plays, and that’s
what he is out there to do.”

Game one, however, turned
out to be a pitching duel
between Pitt’s Junker and St.
John’s lefty Tom Danulevith.
Each man went the distance,
striking out eight batters while
allowing only one walk each.

The only offense came in a
freaky series of events in the
bottom of the second inning.

Designated. hitter Jerry
Berteotti got things started
with a one-out single to left
field. After catcher Pat Walsh
walked and a groundout
moved the runners to second
and third, Reese hit a little
dribbler down the third—base
line, scoring Berteotti on the
infield single.

Then, with runners on first
and third, the Panthers
attempted a double steal. With
Reese off for second base, St.
John’s catcher Kevin Murphy,
suspecting the trickery, threw
the ball to shortstop Joe Toner
hoping to catch Walsh leaning
off third. However, Toner
bobbled the throw, allowing
Walsh to score Pitt’s second"
and final run of the game.

Aside from
inning craziness, Danulevith
(1-2) was on top of his game.
The Redmen pitcher allowed
only two hits and gave up no
runs the rest of the way.
Danulevith had an outstand-
ing move to first baselthat
fooled several Pitt baserun-
ners, picking off three.

“We just never figured it
[Danulevith’s move] out,”

the second I

Jackson said. “Lefty’s are
sometimes tougher, and he
was difficult. He is. one of the
better pitchers in the Big
East.”

But Junker (2-1) and the Pitt
defense held St. John’s score-
less for the entire game and
won the pitching dual in a
low-scoring 2-0 affair.

With the temperature drop-
ping rapidly, the Redmen’s
cold weather gear could not
protect them from another
outstanding pitching perfor-
mance in game two. This time
it was Rakers doing the job.

Using his fastball and curve
effectively, Rakers surren-
dered only four hits and one
earned run while striking out
eight in eight and two-thirds
innings.

Meanwhile, St. John’s starter
C.J. Nitkowski had his prob-
lems with Pitt’s ever—warming
offense. Giving up eight hits
and four runs in seven
innings, Nitkowski was rattled
early. With no help from the
Redmen bats, it was the only
offense Pitt would need.

Pitt broke the 0-0 stalemate
by scoring three runs in the
bottom of the third. With the
bases loaded and one out,

Pitt senior co-captain Genaro Severino earned
a spot in the NCAA Men’s Gymnastics
Championships this past weekend by scoring a
tremendous victory on the vault in the Eastern
Regionals last Saturday at the University of
Illinois at Champaign-Urbana

Severino, the Panthers’ top performer all sea-
son, earned his spot in the NCAA finals by taking
first place on the vault with a score of 9.55. His
mark, although not a career best, was‘ good
enough to beat out a field of some of the
region’s top talent. In both the Eastern and
Western Regional competitions, the top six
teams, along with the best 12 individual gym-
nasts in each event, compete for only three team
and six” individual spaces in the finals, which are
to be held on May 17 at the University of New
Mexico.

“Genaro is a great vaulter,” Pitt head coach
Frank D’Amico said. “He gets extraordinary

Severino reaches  gymnasticsﬁnals 

height and his vaults look good.”

Severino’s-trip to the finals is the first for a Pitt
gymnast since George Sanchez qualified on the
ﬂoor exercises in 1986.

“He really hit his vault,” D’Amico said.‘ “He
does a high degree of difficulty and he just hit it.”

Wiiat makes Severino’s accomplishment all the
more outstanding is that just a year ago he suf-
fered a season-ending injury in Pitt’s first meet.
This season, he rebounded and had one of his
most successful collegiate seasons ever, leading

M the Panthers to an ECAC Championship just a

few weeks ago. I

At the finals, Severino will compete in a pre-
liminary round where only the top eight gym-
nasts on each apparatus advance to the final
round for a shot at a national championship. Of
the final eight, the top six competitors after the
finals are named All-Americans.

“I am happy to have made the comeback,"
Severino said. “I did not think that I was going to
be able to go because the competition got better
while I was hurt last year.”

Women's gym caps solid season with seventh—place ﬁnish at regionals

By Todd S. Rimer
Sta_17‘Writer

It was a long road, but the Pitt women’s
gymnastics team finally reached the goal that it
had set at the beginning of the season.

This past weekend the team travelled to
Ohio State University to participate in the
Northeast Regional Championships, where it

ﬁnished seventh out a field of seven with a

team score of 183.50.

Pitt began the meet on ﬂoor where the
team earned a score of 46.20. Bethany
Toellner was the 19th-best gymnast overall on
floor with a 9.45 and Friend, with a 9.525, fin-
ished 15th.

On vault, the team tallied a score of 45.0
where the top competitor was Friend with a
score of 935 (12th overall).

A score of 45.375 is what the team was
given on the uneven parallel bars. The top

scores were provided by Deena Daller and
Karen Jorgensen, both with a 9.075, Brenda
Stevens (9.175) and Kristin Brown (9.225).

The team finished on beam, where the
gymnasts earned a score of 46.925. Pitt got
scores over 9.0 from Daller (9.275), Meg Johns
(9.425), Friend (9.55), Mikie Myers (9.05) and
Kristin Brown (9.625). Brown's effort helped
her to place eighth among all competitors on
beam, and Friend finished ninth.

The schools that finished ahead of Pitt were
Kent State University, which placed sixth with
a score of 184.40, the University of Rhode
Island (186.35 points), the University of
Massachusetts (186575), the University of
New Hampshire (187825), Ohio State
University (188.125), and the top spot went to
Penn State University, which dominated the
day with a team score of 190.525.

The Panthers finished seventh out of seven
with a very young team. Only two of the gym-

Pitt got its fourth and final run when Reese
settled into the batter’s box in the sixth inning.
On a one-strike count, Reese tookga Nitkowski
fastball letter high and tattooed it over the left

“The second pitch he just threw me the fast-
ball  it was right down the middle, and I took
a hard swing at it and it felt good,” Reese said.

Holding a 4-2 lead into the ninth, Rakers (4-
0) struck out the first two batters but got into

nasts were seniors and the remaining 11 were
of first year or second year status. Only
seniors, Kristin Brown and Karen Jorgensen,
had post—season experience (1991 Northeast
Regional Championship).

The team had injuries that happened before
the season. Shannon Brovm was rehabilitating
from surgery because of ligament damage in
her knee. Kristin Brown performed despite a
sore wria that caused her pain and discomfort
all season. Johns and 1-lalovanic were each
recovering from ankle injuries. Friend and
Myers had to fight through back problems
and Jorgensen was unsure of her status
because ofaninjurytoherwrist

There were more injuries once the season
began. Tracy McKenna was out for the sea-
son because of eventual surgery to her knee
caused by ligament damage and Stevens was
out of the lineup for the first seven meets.

With all the setbacks, making the regionals

was an achievement for the team, one that
was in question for a while.

Pitt had a decent start, but halfway through
the season the team went into a slump, scor-
ing below the 180 mark in one meet. But then
everything turned. A few gymnasts returned
to the lineup and this led to a renewed confi-
dence that carried the team into the playoffs.

‘We were happy to go to regionals consid-
ering that about a month ago we were not
even performing well enough to qualify for
the conference championships,” Friend said.

Northeast Regional Assistant Coach of the
Year Ben Rovee said that this was actually a
rebuilding year for the Panthers..

“We were young and we had numerous
injuries that we had to overcome,” Rovee said.
“We are losing only two gymnasts, and the
remainder of the team will have another year
of experience under its belt We will be ready
for next year.”

trouble when he allowed a walk and a double

to center field. In stepped first—year dynamo,

side—armer Matt Skokowski to slam the door
shut. Skokowski promptly struck out Murphy
to earn his fourth save of the year and improve
Pitt’s Big- East record to 3-1 (17-2 overall) and

to make people notice their improvement as a

team.

I had revenue sharing, and the

salary cap will kick in once the‘
players are making a large
enough percentage of NFL earn-
ings.

The NBA already has these
things but lacks the best feature
of the NFL’s free-agency system,
a rookie salary cap. There will be
outlandish salaries in the NFL
but not for players who haven’t
even played in a pro game yet.

For the Steelers, this system
means that, unlike the Pirates,
they will be able to stay competi-
tive without going broke.

Their work this past weekend
proves they are willing to pay
the money when it makes sense.
First, they retained Neil
O’Donnell by matching the
three—year, $8.125 million offer
sheet he signed with Tampa.

Instead of matching the
absurd one-year, $1.7 million
contract Jerrol Vﬁlliams signed
with San Diego, the Steelers sim-
ply replaced Wftlliams with ex-
Rarn Kevin Greene, who is a
better player.

Wﬂliants is ﬁve years younger,
but he would have been gone
after the one-year deal was up
and Pittsburgh was able to lock
up the 30-year-old Greene for _
three years.

The loss of Hardy Nrckerson
was unavoidable, and the
Steelers are close to bringing
Tyrone Stowe back from the
Cardinals to replace him.

Even if they don’t sign any-
body else, the Steelers have
proven they can compete in an
NFL with free agency.

said “My braking stuff wasn’t very
good”

Rakers stayed with his wicked
curveball in the second game, keep-
ing the Redmen dazed and con-
fused for 8 and two-thirds 

“I felt real good with the curve-

, ball, because of my arm [Rakers

pitched nine innings on Tuesdayl,’.’
he said “I had control of both pitch-

es [fastball and curveball] today, so
we just went with both of them.”

Their performance was so domi-
nating, in fact, that several times the
two made mistakes on the mound,
only to see them corrected with a
fantastic defensive play.

“Even mistakes were good pitch-
es, and any time you do that with
