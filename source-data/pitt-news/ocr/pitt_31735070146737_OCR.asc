Block winner talks food, baseball, life

Staff Writer

Author and journalist Mark Kurlansky
came to Pitt last night, but he had other
things to discuss before reflecting on
his successful writing career.

“Wasn’t it a beautiful thing to see the
Red Sox ruin the Yankees?”

Kurlansky cracked a‘ number of jokes
while he spoke in front of about 70 stu-
dents and faculty members in the Frick
Fine Arts Auditorium.

His lecture, which. covered his past
and upcoming writing projects, was part

of the Pittsburgh Contemporary Writers
Series, sponsored by the University of
Pittsburgh Book Center and University
of Pittsburgh Press. _
Pitt’s English Department named

thor has written several books including
“Cod,” “Salt,” “The Last Fish Tale” and
the most recent, “The Eastern Stars:

MTV should redirect
pro-student energy

By‘ deﬁnition, formalities are dull, time—de-
vouring and unpleasant. Have you ever seen
someone bubble with excitement atthe thought
of attending jury duty or completing general
education requirements? We certainly haven’t.
Neither have we seen anyone elated when faced
with the infamous queen offormal annoyances:
ﬁlling out monotonous forms. _

One such form that many of us have mulled
over is the Free Application for Federal Suf-

dentAid.Eventhoughthefederalﬁnancialaid “

form has already seen radical simpliﬁcation
and shortening, it still takes time to ﬁll out and
consists of multiple parts. But that doesn’t mean
expensive campaigns at ﬁll'tl1EI' simplifying the
form are worth the effort.

Given its recent FAFSA-simpliﬁcation cam-

paign, MTVNetworks would probably disagree. .

Working with the College Board, MTV is hold-
ing an open contest for the most innovative
way to simplify the FAFSA application using
technology — like creating a video game, for
example. .
‘As part of the “College Affordability Chal

lenge,” the company is offering a $10,000 prize
for the winning individual or team, and the
winners may work with a professional design
ﬁrm to develop their ideas with an operating
budget of $100,000. MTV thinks that the
complicated FAFSA form may dissuade ﬁrst-
generation college applicants or those with a
language barrier. A

The Pitt News applauds M'I‘V’s clear concern
for issues in education, but we question whether
the FAFSA contest addresses a real problem.

Forone, there’s little proof that the current
FAFSA form can skew the number of people
applying for federal ﬁnancial aid, let alone
dissuade anyone from applying to college in
general. Citing studiesfrom the College Board,
the Affordability Challenge website says that

 

“upwards of two million college students don’t
apply for ﬁnancial aid that is available to them
each year, and that ‘almost two-thirds of stu-
dents surveyed ﬁnd the process of applying for
ﬁnancial aid diﬂicult and time consuming.” But
don’t countthis as empirical support. V
For anyone who understands the difference
between correlation and causation, these ob-

;..S_:eI"AV3..lZl(;),I;_1";$7dl.I_llTl?lZ addup to_anythi_ng meaning-
,  million could haveother 
‘to pay or not even know about ﬁnancialraid,.

and even if ﬁlling in blanks or clickingthrough
electronic pages are a pain, it doesn’t mean
that people would actuallyforgo college before
completing aform. Z,

The FAFSA form has already been reformed
for greater usability.—In fact, afourth of the ques-
tions were cut last year and the online version
went from 30 screens to 10. And FAFSA’s on-

line instant messenger help desk and its 1-800 '

number’svoice—activated menu make applying
for aid as easy as it gets. ,

*7; Surely, the ability of an individual to‘ com-
plete afederal form should have no bearing on
his potential as a college applicant, and consid-
ering the unholy cost of today’s tuition, ﬁnancial
aid should be readily available. But realistically,
knowing how to tackle forms like FAFSA is a

modern-day survival skill — you can’t sign an ~

apartment lease, buy a car or get a job without

._.exercis;it1gp3=IperworkskiHs- 

At this stage, splashing colors on 'theFAFSA
screen or drawing aid-applicants through an
MTV-produced video game experience wouldn’t
help alleviate application difficulties for the
disadvantaged, if indeed those difliculties exist.
IfM'I‘V really wants to make a difference, the
company should sponsor ﬁnancial aid work-
shops at individual high schools. And We’re
sure many worthy scholarship ﬁinds are just
itching for a $110,000 donation. I

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
To the Editor,

I would like to respond to your edito-
rial piece yesterday on the forthcoming
Medal of Honor game. Your argument
has atfew key and irresponsible flaws.
First, your concern over its reception has
everything to do with an ignorant public
and nothing to do with the game itself.
Take issue with people, not EA. Second,
you make a large leap in the second half
‘to call the game “distasteful, disrespect-

{ful and inappropriate.” As stated in your I

article, the game has yet to be released,
meaning no one on your staff has played
it. In fact, EA has been unwilling to release
much information on the game at all, so
you wouldiseem to be without grounds.
to proclaim it as such. The attention to
detail EA has paid is not just to sell games

but to make them accurate, and there-
fore respect the men who are involved
in the conflict. Last, your wrap—up call-
ing games nothing more than attempts
at proﬁt is insulting and shows a lack of
awareness toward current media. If it is
inappropriate to make a game, it should
be as well to release any book, movie or
other piece of media. And that certainly
is not the case. Until people from other
media cease to regard video games as a
lesser entity, they will continue to ‘look
foolish, biased and ignorant as you have
made yourselves appear. But if you wish
to deem it nothing more than profit, you
cannot take issue with its impact. After

' all, it’s just entertainment right?

Hipster-riflc java joint

Vt'sit.Olt°ve1ﬁ’s new coffeehouse, but only if you’re hip enough

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

Access to a thriving hipster community is
one of the best things about life on a college
campus. Since everything from Bettie Page
to Betty Crocker is hip these days, hipsters
are clearly the way to go if you’re looking
to get a lot of bang for your entertainment
buck. Hipsters also have a lot of disposable
cash despite the fact that few of them are.
employed, which iswhy we have decided
to open our hip coffeehouse.
Coffeehouses have long served as ha-
vens for the hippest people around. Your
typical independent coffeehouse attracts
scores of scenesters, band kids, happen-
ingsters, gutter punks, trance-hoppers

and other in—the—know folks. Featuring
standoffish, incompetent baristas and
wallpapered with cheaply Xeroxed post-
ers touting unknown bands, these places

have supplanted the decaying industrial ,

sector as the driving force of our nation’s
economy.

Since there are so many coffeehouses
out there ——- 1,532,009 shops in Pennsyl-
vania alone, pouring nearly two billion
gallons of coffee perday — we need to
ensure that our hip coffeehouse is some-
thing special.  ’

First, we’ll need a hip location. Hip-
ster businesses are typically situated in
neighborhoods that are coming back.

These neighborhoods often have an arts
initiative in place, which provides impetus
for replacing disadvantaged people with
bike shops, vinyl stores and other services
that hipsters require.

Our hip coffeehouse will do the hipsters
one better: We’ll move every month, and
our location will always be in some place
that is coming back. Eventually, we’ll even
relocate to established neighborhoods on
the premise that they too might eventually
decline and thus need to be brought back.
What could be hipper than staying ahead
of trends that aren’t even happening?

Another thing that our hip coffeehouse
will need is a surly, distant staff composed
of the hippest people in the area. Our baris-
tas will be so hip that most of them won’t
even show up for work. The baristas who
do make occasional appearances will sit

with the customers, making coffee and '

cleaning tables only when the urge strikes
them. Instead of a cash register, customers

Baristas will compose,

perform onthe spot

our discerning hipsters from experiencing
the pain of listening to bands that have_
“sold out” by playing a gig where they were
heard by more than 50 people.

Our hip coffeehouse will host its share
of poetry slams, albeit with a twist that is
certain tolwin hus awards from the city’s
free independent newsweekly. Instead of
the formal deliveries of apostrophes to
parents that take place at these events,
our slams will consist of randomly selected
conversations between our hip patrons.

A Given the high caliber of hipster that at-

tends our hip coffeehouse, these conversa-
tions are likely to be better than anything
ever written by anyone, ever.

Now that the plan for our hip coffe_e— -

house is in place, we want to let you know

will just drop as muchmoney as they feel
like spending into a cool~looking hat that
resembles the hat worn by Marlon Brando
in that one movie. V

The coffee served by our hip coffee-
house will come from the various war~torn
lands that hipsters enjoy supporting. All
of this coffee will be guaranteed as fairer-
than-fair trade and will have been grown
organically in tiny plots overseen by arti-
sans who have thousand-yeartraditions
of sustainable farming as well as hard-to-
pronounce surnames. The coffee might
be tasty, but our lazy baristas will brew it
with so little care that everything we serve
will wind up tasting like a combination of
toothpaste and dishwater. Given our hip
coffeehouse’s commitment to sustainabil-
ity, this will make perfect sense: The water
used to brew the coffee will be dishwater
recycled from our ﬁlthy kitchen.

Like any hip coffeehouse, we will play
the kind of whiny, atonal music favored
by hipsters. Unlike most other coffee-
houses, this music will be composed on
the spot and performed live in the store.
Performers will never reappear and songs

will never be replayed, which will prevent

No, we can’t have that. You need to
stay in your room and try to catch up on
whatever the best hipsters are doing these
days. You’ll never succeed, though, be-
causecatching up isn’t what the clientele
at our hip coffeehouse will be doing. These
people will be ﬁguring out the way you
should wear your jeans (ﬂared is the new
tapered which was once the new ﬂared),
sunglasses (medium is the new small which
was once the new big), jockstraps (which
are the new briefs which were once the .
new chastity belts) and everything else
that matters. They’re so great, which is
why our hip coffeehouse will be too.

Local ‘cannibal culinary snobs’

‘Kayla Sweeney '

For The Pitt News

The last cannibal who dined in Pittsburgh ended
up becoming famous: people know him as Han-
nibal Lecter.

But Pittsburgh is not done with cannibalism
quite yet. Daniel Parme’s short story-turned—novel
“Hungry,” which tells the tale of an underground
society of cannibals in Pittsburgh, is due to be
burned into a movie and ﬁlmed here.

Parme, who tends the bar atjoe Mama’s, has
taken the project into his own hands, despite
never having written or directed a ﬁlm before.
One of his goals for the project is to show that a
good movie can be created without Hollywood’s
inﬂuence, using only volunteers, loaned equip-
ment and passion.

Parme hopes the movie will have a budget of
$10,000,whichwill mostlybe usedforinsurance
and permits among other expenses. The budget
will rely on donations from people interested in
ﬁirthering this movie and thus the Pittsburgh
ﬁlm scene.

Parme has set up an account to raise money
on the website www.kickstarter.com, which helps
tofund artistic endeavors donations. His
goal is to raise $2,500 by Oct. 29 and, according
to the website, he’s already raised $700. Ifthe

on Thursday at Cattivo on 44th and Plummer in
Lawrenceville and will feature music, prizes and
fun for a suggested donation of $10.

Parme has already arrangedto shoot theﬁlm

the Steel City, using local actors and actresses.

“The story belongs to Pittsburgh spiritually.
The setting couldbeanywhere, I suppose, but
the sense ofhumor and routine of activity is
very Pittsburgh,” Daniel Friedson, Parme’s
lawyer and member ofthe “Hungry” produc-
tion team, said in an e—maiL

Friedson, who met Parme injoe Mama’s, went
on to say that they will certainly take advantage
of the gorgeous vistas of Pittsburgh.

Parme, a Pittsburgh native, explained in an
e-mailthatthe inspirationfor “Hungry” came in
2005 after arock-climbing excursion with some
of his friends. “One day while my ﬁiends were
climbing, Ithought aboutwhatitwould be like if
there were some horrible disaster, and for some
reason I had to eat themto survive,” he said.

Fromthis macabre ﬂeetingthoughtwas born
a short story upon which “Hungry” was based.
Parme decidedtoturnthe short story into anovel

after watchingjay Leno interview Aron Ralston,

the now—farnous man that got his arm caught

The novel was inspired by an idea Parme had about having to eat his friends while hiking‘

undera boulder andwas forced to self-amputate
it with a dull knife to survive.

In Parme’s novel, a man and his friends are v

caught in an accident during a mountain climb-
ing expedition, and the main character, Travis,
is forced to eat his friends to survive. Afterbeing
rescued, his survival story becomes famous, and
he’s soon wooed by Pittsburgh’s cannibal elite.

' Parme published the novel chapterby chapter

FEATURE

Delicious
drinks for

the cold

Jennifer Hirsch
’; Staﬁ" Writer

The change in weather was distinct this
week: the chilling breeze, the ominous grey
clouds.

Though it seems completely gloomy,
there’s a bright side: It is officially the sea-
son of ciders, cocoas and hot coffees galore.

And if you’re looking for something exciting _

to spice up your old favorites, here are some
tips and tricks for enjoying both nonalcoholic
and spiked beverages.

Hot apple cider has that crisp taste that
reminds you of autumn. It smells heavenly,
tastes divine and will warm you from head to
toe. Although delicious on its own, adding a
swirl of caramel, using syrups or candy, or stir-
ring in a cinnamon stick can boost up the ﬂa-
vor. If you’ve got an extra minute or two, using
the stove instead of the microwave provides
a more even ﬂavor and sends an irresistible

. aroma wafting through the kitchen.

Hot chocolate also has its place among
tasty cold—weather drinks. Adding cinnamon,
caramel or — for those adventurous drink-
ers — even abit of chili powder can give your
cocoa a kick. If you’re a fan of mocha drinks
but can’t justify the cost, put a little cocoa
powder and milk in your coffee and you’ve
got a homemade version.

Coffee — a year-round favorite — has

been manipulated with everything from al- .

mond to caramel, but these kinds of additions
are elusive outside of coffee shops. If you’re
looking for something similar for your brew,
sprinkle some favorite spices — like those
used in pumpkin pie — into the ﬁlter with
the grounds. In a matter of minutes, you’ll
be in heaven. ~

These drinks can easily be made at home
or found at the plethora of Oakland coffee
houses. But if you’re looking for something
with a little extra kick to warm up a tailgat-
ing session or spice up a Halloween party,
those of you over 21 will have to don your
own barista hat.

Hot apple cider and spiced rum is a,delec-
table, easy-to-prepare blend that just can’t
go wrong. Try one shot of rum to 8 ounces

the liqueur folds itself into the envelopes of

Parme feeds
film budget

with donations

Hungry 4 6

Pittsburgh Film festival. So when the opportu-
- nity presented itself, Parme told her about his
manuscript for “Hungry.” She agreed to read
it on the flight home to L.A., and upon landing
immediately called to say she loved it.

Parme churned out the script, but due to
artistic differences, the two have since parted

“She suggested some changes which he didn’t
agree with. He decided to go his own way in-
stead of compromise his artistic vision,” Sean
O’Donnell, a writer for Ophelia Street, said in
an e-mail. _ V

One day, Parme picked up a book on how to
make independent movies on a budget, which
led to his building miniature sets in his kitchen,
picking out a cast of actors and editing and re-
writing the script, Friedson said. A

For those who get queasy at the very men-
tion of human cannibalism, never fear. Parme
explains that “Hungry” is not the gore-fest it
very well could be. The story instead takes the

t route of black comedy, a subtle look at moral
ambiguity that just happens to feature humans
eating each other. i ‘

O’Donnell said that, yes, it features cut—up
body parts and blood, but that itwillbe no worse
than what can be found on network television.

Although there have been movies and nov-
els that examine the age-old question “What
would you do to survive?” few accompany that
with, as Friedson puts it, “underground cannibal -
culinary snobs.” .

“Hungry” may deal with an unusual topic,
but Parme is conﬁdent in its universality.

“It is the story of a man who ﬁnds himself
in an extraordinary situation and is forced to
decide who he really is and what he must do. It’s
something everyone can relate to,” he said.

VOLLEYBALL

Pantherswin two in N.J. last weekend

Torie Wytiaz
Stajf Writer

Pitt needed a spark to turn around its pair of
most recent games in Newjersey.

Down 2-1 in the match and 12-7 in the set
against Seton Hall this weekend, head coach
Toby Rens gathered his team together. It was
time for a leader to step up, and senior Imani
Harper provided the spark that Rens was look-
ing for.“

Imani Harpermade an outstanding defensive
play which showed a lot of heart,” Rens said of
Harper’s diving effortfor aball. “Fromthatpoint
on, we showed great poise in the matc .”

That effort and poise led to a successful end
to a four-match road trip. -

‘Rutgers and Seton Hall, separated by a
30-minute drive, proved to be successfhl loca-
tions for the Panthers as they improved to 8-11
overall and 3-1 in the Big East.

After a Friday night 3-0 victory over Rutgers
(7-9, 0-3 Big East), the Panthers travelled from
Newark, N.J., to South Orange, N.]., where they
defeated the Seton Hall Pirates 3-2 (7-12, 2-2) on
Sunday afternoon.

Pitt 3, Rutgers 0
In their second straight-set victory of the year,

the Panthers defeated the Scarlet Knights with
set scores of 25-21, 25-21 and 25-8.

Seniors Harper and Amy Town led the Pan— -

thers’ offense and ended the match with13 kills
each, while junior Kiesha Leggs added seven
kills, ﬁve coming in the second set.

The ﬁrst two sets of the match proved to
be a challenge for the Panthers, with six lead
changes in the first set and an early Pitt deﬁcit
in the second. _ .

Yet, after Pitt secured the second set lead
at a score of 14-13, the rest of the match went
the Panthers’ way as they dominated Rutgers
inthe final set. ~

“I was pleased with our ability to sustain
a high level of volleyball in the mate ,” Rens
said. “We did not give Rutgers a chance to gain
control, especially in the third set.”

In that ﬁnal set, Town accounted for six of
Pitt’s 14 kills and added three more points with
three aces. K

Pitt’s serving, as an aspect of the game ad-
dressed in practices leading up to the Rutgers

match, proved to be an asset throughout the,

contest against Rutgers as the Panthers recorded
ﬁve aces. . - I

“We have been working on serving in prac-
tice,” Rens said. “It was strong against Rutgers '

and helped add another dimension to our
e.” P

Defensively, the Panthers were character— V ‘V

istically strong as sophomore Margy
Acton recorded a match—high 12 digs,
while senior Melanie Feldman finished
the three-set match with eight digs.

Pitt 3, Seton Hall 2

‘ Justdays before Pitt faced Seton Hall in

a conference match, Pirate outside hit-

- ter Sarah Osmun was named the Big East

Player of the Week after earning the most
kills in school history.

Osmun added to that total with a
match—high 21 kills, but the Panthers left
a highly competitive match victorious with
set scores of 25-23, 18-25, 20-25, 25-19
and 19-17. . ‘

Lucas Felakl Senior Staff Photographer
Amy Town and the Panthers went 2-0 in games against Rutgers and Seton Hall last weekend.

Seton Hall team still reveling in an im-
pressive conference victory.

“Seton Hall had been playing excep-
tionally well,” Rens said. “They had just
beaten Louisville in a 3-2 match after los-
ing a tough match to No. 25 Cincinnati.”

The Pirates jumped ahead with a 2-1
lead in the fourth set, but could not close
the match and allowed the Panthers to put
together a 10-4 run following the timeout

I and Harper’s stellar defensive play.

In the ﬁfth and ﬁnal set of the match,
the Panthers battled through 11 ties and

, earned a hard-fought match victory.

wr-

Dame always

draws intrigue

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt football team will enter the sp§t-
light once again this weekend with a chance
to prove itself on the national stage.

The ﬁrst two times didn’t go so well.

The Panthers stumbled in their season
opener against Utah, and then Miami throt-
tled them on ESPN to the tune of 31-3.

This weekend offered a glimmer of hope
when a rearranged offensive line toppled
Florida International University 44-17.

But that was Florida International. This
Saturday, it’s Notre Dame.

Sure, Notre Dame isn’t the Notre Dagae
of the past. The Fighting Irish are 2-3 and
unranked with losses to Michigan, Michigan
State and Stanford on their record. But it’s
still Notre Dame, the team everyone — ex-
cept Notre Dame fans and people who jump
on the bandwagon because they are Irish,
Catholic or a combinationlof the two —
loves to hate.

There’s a mystique surrounding Notre
Dame. There always will be. There’s a reason
why Notre Dame sells out Heinz Field, why
last year students sat in line in the cold for
hours and then nearly trampledeach otlmr
for wristbands. .

Simply put, it’s Notre Dame. Really, noth-
ing else needs to be.said.

The list of reasons other college football
fans dislike the Fighting Irishis long and
growing: the NBC contract that requires tglge

station to air all N otre Dame home games '

regardless of the opponent, the perceived
arrogance of theirfans -- even though
they haven’t been a team worth being even
slightly arrogant about since 2006, when
they went 10-3 and still lost to LSU 41-14 in
the Sugar Bowl — Touchdownjesus, Riiti-ya
and those previously discussed bandwagon

' fans. - -

And now, just to add alittle annoyance
for Pitt fans, Brian Kelly is the head coach.
Yes, the same Brian Kelly who coached Cin-
cinnati to that little victory at Heinz 
last year, keeping the Panthers from the 
East Championship and a BCS bowl game.

enough at critical points in the match to
win.”

The Panthers had four players con-
tribute double—digit ﬁgures in kills, as
Harper led the team with 19 and Town,
Leggs and Rachel Kalberer added 15, 10
and 14 respectively.

Acton’s defensive presence carried over
from the Rutgers match as she came up

their own challenges to the Panthers.

Panthers playing With conﬁdence

“Rutgers and Seton Hall have different
styles of play,” Rens said. “Rutgers is more
deliberate in their offense whereas Seton
Hall will try to push the tempo.”

But the Panthers seemed to take Leggs’
perspective on preparing for two distinctly
different teams.

“It doesn’t matter who the team is,”
Leggs said. “We can beat them.”

Big East play, will return home with con-

Pitt hoping

to continue

success vs. Irish

Kirschman 4 11

Here’s the good news for Pitt fans: The
Panthers have had some recent success
against the Fighting Irish. _

Last year, Pitt defeated Notre Dame 27-22
at,Heinz Field. The Panthers led by as many
as 18 points in the fourth quarter and held
off a late Fighting Irish rally. Lewis ran for
154 yards, Bill Stull threw for 236 yards
and a touchdown and Jon Baldwin had 142
receiving yards.

Two years ago, Pitt and Notre Dame
played a classic, four—overtim.e game in
South Bend. Conor Lee won the game with

 . a 22-yard field goal to-seal the 36—33'vic5

tory. The Panthers rallied back after falling
behind 17-3 at halftime, forcing overtime
with a touchdown pass from Pat_Bostick to
Baldwin with 2:22 remaining in regulation.

 ‘ LeSean McCoy rushed for 169 yards, and

Bostick threw for 164 yards.

In 2004, Tyler Palko threw ﬁve touch-
down passes, completing 26 of 42 passes
for 334 yards as he guided the Panthers to
their ﬁrst victory in South Bend since 1986.
He led the Panthers on a game—winning
drive late in the fourth quarter that ended
in a ﬁeld goal. ' _

Every one of those games is memorable.
Regardless of records, Pitt vs. Notre Dame
will always be an important game, one Pitt
fans circle on their schedules. It’s a rivalry
for the‘ Fighting Irish faithful, too, as Pitt
is NotreDame’s ﬁfth—most-played college
football opponent.» .

Ask Pitt fans aboutsome of the best
games in recent memory, and at least two
of those wins come to mind.

Would those victories have been as mem-
orable if they didn’t come against Notre
Dame? Maybe.

But it makes it that much sweeter that
they did. I »
