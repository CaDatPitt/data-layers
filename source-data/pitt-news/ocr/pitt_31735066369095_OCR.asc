Residence Life Institutes Steps
‘far To Increase Lothrop Security

By SUE McFARLAND
‘ Pitt Newsstaffwriter

The Office of Residence Life has
attempted to improve the security
at Lothrop ,Hall following the
alleged rape there in October.

“We’ve been meeting with a
committee of students at Lothrop,
and we've-made some agreements
about. what could be done to
improve the security,”, said Fred
Fonseca, director of the office.
“We came up with both long-term
and short-term alternatives to the

problems that we were faced with

in Lothrop Hall.” i _
Fonseca said extra campus police
have been assigned continually to

the dormitory since the rape. He '

added that a double security

system, checking students’ IDs at

two different points, has been

‘ asked for increased lighting around

the front of the dormitory and near
the entrance to . Presbyterian
Hospital. They also 0 asked that
~ locks be installed on thewindows of
the grand lounge on the first ﬂoor.
“I must admit that some of these
projects are not completed, but we
are working on them,’ Fonseca
said. He added,that he. did not
know when the projects.might be
finished. _. A
Fonseca cited other requests the
student committee made, including
the installation of change machines
in the main lobby area and sealing.

terian Hospital with the dormitory.

“Apparently the students said

moreitime to check IDs,” Fonseca
said. “But to close that «tunnel
between the hospital and Lothrop
involves so much more than just
‘closing it off and forgetting about
it. The tunnel was put there. to
provide trafﬁc between the two
buildings, and all the parties
involved must be considered.”
Fonseca said some re-examina-
tion of the main ‘entrance to the
building is underway now/ to spot
any deficiencies in the existing
security setup. '

Acc_ording to some- Lothrop V

residents, the fear and general
concern present during the weeks
following the alleged rape have
subsided somewhat.

    Discuss $2.9 Million Budget on

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH C

Pitt News Staff Writer

Univeristy administrators are
meeting this week to determine

‘wwiheire they can lessen ‘expenditures

to cut the University budget by $2.9
million. ' ' I A

The cut, announced by Chancel-

_ lor Posvar on Nov. 21, has become

necessary because this year’s

enrollment ' is 1,100 full-time

equivalant students lessvthan the
projected enrollment _for 1978.’

As a result, the tuition income will

be about $2.4 .million less than

expected. i T '

i In a statement on the budget cut,
. Posvar said the best way to cut the

budget would be to reduce

personnel by not filling vacated’

posts. ' _
The chancellor said it also might
' be possible to trim expenses in
areas such as part-time secretarial

services, consultation fees, travel, "

telephone costs and printing.
“They (the provost, vice chancel-
lors, deans and directors) should

consider reductions in areas such '

as faculty and staff vacancies,
sabbaticals, contract renewals,
part-time , staff, consluting and
travel',”‘Posvar stated?” ‘ 

Th drop in enrollment that led to

the budget cut became obvious as.

early as this July. At that time the
registrar’s ofﬁce found the gap
between the number of new and
continuing students registered last
year and those registered this year
to beabout 1,500. V "“‘ ‘f"‘"

The. drop in enrollment later

students by September.

‘ The chancellor said the drop_ in
enrollment seemed to be caused by
the high level of tuition and the
condition of the local economy as

0 decreased to approximately 1,000 .

well as deﬁciencies in recruiting‘

and admissions efforts.
“Our.-first action was the
installation this summer of a
vigorous an< effective recruiting
and admissiow operations, under
the leadersh: of an able new

director of ad 'ssions who should \

correct the p sblem next year,”
Posvar said. "From now on we
also want all

interest and persuade’ the most
able young people from this region
to attend Pitt.”‘ - . -

The drop in enrollment ' came
after the University agreed ‘to
increase salaries of employees -7

percent, improve fringe benefits 3

regional campus employees.

These agreements, along witha. - _' ‘
' state appropriation increase of less 7 
. than 5 percent and a committment
to help correct the medical school’s '
chronic deficit, left little ﬂexibility

in this year’s ‘budget.

Dr. Jack Freeman, vice chancel-K

The ad hoc committee’ to find
housing alternatives submitted
a revised “McCormick Com-
promise" on Friday to, Dr.
William ’Markus, acting vice
chancellor for student affairs.

The revision is in the lottery
part of the compromise, which
now is to be based on gender
instead of class standing, as
was first proposed.

Compromise, approved by the"
Inter-Resident Board on Nov.
17, combined a class standing
based lottery system and the
first-come, first-serve room-as-
signment system used in recent
-years. Students applying for
housing were to be given a
choice about which system they

The original McCormick"

wanted to use.

The revised compromise still
provides for the option of
standing in line on aflrst-come,
first-serve basis.

The committee also pre-
sented a second proposal to
Markus that would create a
lottery with separate drawings
by males and females only.

Committee member. Gary
Falatovich said the committee
believes the gender lottery was
more fair than the class
standing system proposed in
the original compromise. In
that systm, 10 percent of the
rooms would be made available

to seniors, 20 percent to
juniors and 30 percent to
sophomores.

The McCo_rmick revision
proposes that two ﬁshbowls be

Committee Sends LotteryA|ternotives. to Markus

used by students who’ opt for ‘
the lottery system instead of
the four that were to be used in
the class-standing‘ arrange-
ment.‘ , .. ‘

Males and females will pick
numbers from the two bowls.
Women will be allotted approx-
imately 57 percent of the dorm
space, which is the percentage
of women living in ‘the
residence halls this year,
according to Falatovich.

Falatovice said the gender
percentage will be more
balanced for the actual lottery
pick, however. He said
reserved rooms for chancellor’s
scholars and handicapped stu-
dents have a higher ratio of
females to males and,‘ although
scholars and handicapped are

' considered in overall statistics,‘,'

they will notparticipate in -the
lottery, lowering the percent
female advantage.

Falatovich said he did not
know what effect the revision
and the new proposal will have
on Markus-’ decision.

“'It’s up to _ Markus,” said
F alatovich. ‘ ‘He can accept the
revision, the second proposal
based on the gender lottery or
the original lottery proposal -
(based on class standing).”d

Falatovich said Markus indi-
cated earlier that he doesn’t _
want a housing system in which
students have to wait in line,
apparantly to avoid congestion
in the housing lines when
renewal came up. Markus will
review the proposals today,
and a decision is expected early ‘
this week.

JoAnne Miller, another Lothrop

“Right after it happened every-

  Stassen Seeks GOP Presidential Bid for Sixth Time

By The Associated Press

ST. PAUL, Minn.—It is not age
that Harold Stassen runs hardest
against. Churchill, he likes to
remember, saved a country in his
70s. And at 71, in his lightly
grayed toupee, Stassen looks more
like a big, somber uncle than an
aging grandfather.

What Harold Stassen runs
hardest against is the look that
came over Walter Cronkite’s face
last month when Stassen announc-
ed he was running for president
again.

It was the sixth time Stassen had

announced a bid for the Republican‘

presidential nomination since 1948,
and today many Americans see not
a serious candidate but a perennial
one with little hope.

This time, though, Stessen says
public financing will allow him the
money to make a serious run.
And he yearns to be taken
seriously.

On Dec. 9, 1939, in
off-the-record speech to Washing-
ton’s Gridiron Club, Stassen says,
he called for an end to international
isolation and advocated a United
Nations. Franklin D. Roosevelt,
who was there, named him a
delegate to the conference thélff
wrote the U.N. charter. _

As early as 1954, Stassen says,
he opposed intervention in Viet-
nam. President Eisenhower, who
had named him head of the Foreign
Operations_ Administration, was
under pressure from Vice President
Richard Nixon and Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles to help the
French. Stassen says he was one of
those counseling staying out-
which Eisenhower did. Later,
Stassen says, he met with Lyndon
Johnson and' told him to stay out,
too—which Johnson didn’t. In
1968, Stassen was
candidate in the Wisconsin Rep-
ublican primary.-

The issue of peace was one on
which Stassen made his early

a peace-

national reputation. He played a
central role in organizing the first
summitmeeting, an effort to end
the Cold War. ._In 1955, he was
given Cabinet rank as special
White House assistant on disarm-
ament. “If this is not to be an age
of atomic hysteria and horror, we
must make it an age of interna-
tional understanding and coopera-
tion,” he said then.

In 1956, Stassen took a leave
from the White House to lead a

move to dump Nixon as Eisen-
hower’s running mate. But it
failed, and Stassen wound up
seconding Nixon’s nomination.
Today, though, he points to his
effort against Nixon: “It’s not a
matter of whatl had against Nixon.
It was a matter of observing him
from across the table and making a
judgement of what the whole world
knows now.”

Stassen says his attempt to dump
Nixon destroyed his standing in the

GOP establishment.
was not the only one he offended.
Stassen was the first of Eisen-
hower’s advisors to publicly tangle
with Sen. Joseph McCarthy. He
was one of the first Republicans to
support Social Security, bank
deposit insurance, detente, and UN
membership for both Germanys
and both Chinas. He tried to get
the GOP to befriend labor. He
remains outside the GOP establish-
ment now.

Monitors ResponsibleforLessCrime
Residents Fear Big Brother Potential

By The Associated Press

PHOENIXVILLE—Some residents
feared Big Brother was spying on
them when police installed televi-
sion monitors in the downtown

district four years ago.
But the controversy has waned
with time because-of a combination

I of public apathy and what some

consider bureaucratic bungling.

The monitor system to curb
street crime is not judged a success
by most accounts—the only moni-
tor working properly can’t even
reveal a clear_ picture of a license
plate.

Still, Van Scott, operations
officer for the borough police, cites
statistics showing a 60 percent drop

in arrests for major crimes in the‘

down town district during the first
year of the operation.

But those ﬁgures——comparing
arrests for 12 months "ending
October 1974 to the 12 ending
October 1975-—are the only hard
evidence he has.

RESIDENT ASSISTANT POSITIONS FOR 1979-80
1 FALL-WINTER ACADEMIC YEAR
DEADLINE: 11 JANUARY, 1979

Scott says downtown crime
hasn’t risen during subsequent
years, and he attributes the
checked level to the deterrent value
of the monitors, installed in three
locations under 90 percent funding
by a federal grant. He says major
crimes in other parts of the
borough increased 24 percent
during the one-year period cited.

"It’s like a candy store, "’ Scott
explained. “Nobody’s going to
steal anything if the guy’s standing
there.”

The monitor equipment, he said
cost $11,500 to set up, with most of
the money coming from the federal

ministration. The other 10 percent’
was split between the state and
local governments.

The ofﬁcer said that to provide
the same protection with foot
patrols would cost $192,000 a year
in salaries alone, not to mention
beneﬁts. .

Paul Hogan, a member of "the

American Civil Liberties Union,
thinks the cameras are in invasion
of privacy, and something of a joke
as far’ as law enforcement_ is
concerned. .

“I really feel a tremendous
pressure.,personally, when I walk
down the street,” Hogan said.
“And all they do is drive them
criminals to the back doors or else
to other parts of the borough. '

“All of the research that I have
done shows that it is an invasion of

privacy,” he said, adding that the-<-.

issue of street monitoring has
never been carried to the Supreme
Court. .

He said that he has researched
other monitoring systems—in Mt.
Vernon, N.Y., Times Square, and
Atlantic City, N.J.——and found that
in each case the cameras have been
a failure. . '

The vision of one of the cameras
here has been blocked by the

ment ‘project, Scott said.

t  Discussing
Security
At Lothrop

After a series of incidents involving an alleged rape
and assaults against students, residents from the
Medical Center Nurses Residence and University of-
-ficials met to discuss new security measures for the
Lothrop street dorm. I j A «

And while precautions should have been im-
plemented much earlier, the Office of Residence Life
must be commended for meeting with students and
considering more security. .

New security already added by the ORL includes
extracampus police and a double security system
checking student IDs at two different points. Mem-
bers of the Lothrop committee have asked for in-
creased lighting at the frontof the dorm and near the
entrance to Presbyterian Hospital and locks for win-
dows at the grand lounge on the ground floor.

“Some of these projects are not completed,” said
Fred Fonseca, director of the office, “but we are
working on them.” .   --

Hopefully, these discussions will lead to a much
sounder security system for Lothrop students.

The question of more Lothrop security was raised
mid October, when a rape occured in the dorm,
‘followed by alleged sexual assaults and intrusions in-

to female showers that left severalresidents ‘fscared
stiff.” ’

One suspect was caught and is currently awaiting
trial for various charges.

While extra campus police were added following"

the assaults, apparently frightened residents did not
believe it to be’ adequate, as a “buddy”- security
system was formed by the students themselves.

That fear, according to some Lothrop students,.

has been eased now with’the extra precautions.

A “They’ve (ORL) really done everything within
their power to help us,” said Debbie Roberts,
president of the Lothrop Dorm Council.. “This was
something they didn’t plan on happening this year,

all these improvements were not worked into their
-budget.”

It is hard to understand why the University failed
to consider tighter security when the dorm was
opened to students years back. Thereason for tight
security in the Towers and the Quad is obvious:
most resident students are housed in those complexes
and the constant flow of ‘students and guests
traveling to and from their rooms must be observed
with greater scrutiny. _

But Lothrop Hall, whichhouses many fewer, is
not as close to the center of campus, is in a poorly lit
area and is surrounded by._a variety of complexes
where traffic is most frequent.

_ This is all hindsight, however, and thefact remains
that finally something is being done to assure proper
protection‘:
problem bred false rumors and frightened

many
students before action was taken. A

“Now everyone has s'ort"of forgotten about it,’_’ ‘

one resident said.‘ “They leave their doors unlocked
and really don’t seem to care anymore.” ,

But it is regretable that the security‘

Security shoud not be in the hands of_ the police
and the University alone. Students must also share in
the responsibility. Not caring anymore about locking
one’s door after a crisis has passed does not help of-
ficials who are responsible for the students’ protec-
tion. And signing in a strangerbecause he wants to
gst inside is a mistake too many students are guilty
0 . .

“Right now people are more anxious to know
exactly what the Office of Residence Life plans to do
in the way of makinginiprovements, likethe lighting
outside Lothrop by Presbyterian, ” Roberts said.

The new improvements are a start, but we strongly
urge that Fonseca’s uncompleted projects be finished
as soon ‘as possible. However, vigilance by Lothrop
residents must complement any phycial improvement

to the security system at Lothrop. Students must do

their part by locking doors.

I a crime.

What ever happened to that old
notion about the establishment of a
National Press Council to scrutinize
the nation's press?

The matter of press councils is a
relatively old idea but recently has
been back in the news following
landmark court decisions involving
the press, including the Myron
Farber case and the Stanford Daily

ruling. The Supreme Court ruled .

in the latter last June that police
have the right to obtain a warrant
and make unannounced searches‘ of
private property—particularly
newsrooms—to look for evidence of
Farber is the New York

Times_ reporter jailed last summer

for refusing to turn over notes used A

in investigating a dozen mysterious
deaths at the Riverdell Hospital in
Oradell, N.J.. in 1965 and 1966.
Again the question of , the
people's right to know is being
argued by journalists, and, recent-
ly, more of the latter arguments

A have been lost than won.

A press council is supposed to

serve as a critic or judge‘ of the .

press. Couricils are, however.
controversial and bitterly opposed
by most journalists. The New York
Times has been a persistent
o‘f!pmertf'5f‘§i1ch a proposal".

Back in December 1972, the
Twentieth Century Fund, a small
yet prestigious foundation, esta-
blished it was creating a group with
two missions: first, to investigate

‘ and report on allegations. against‘
-J.naj9.r_.. news

organizations - and
secondly, to attempt to speak for
the press when its is threatened by
official restrictions. The project
was the result of an -18-month study
by 14 jurists. educators and
newsmen. The establishment of a
15-member council of journalists

and others was recommended by '

the committee.

Twentieth Century Fund indeed
did establish its press council. and
a proposal even made it to
Congress. both to no «avail.

Congress has been split on the
matter as much as newsmen

themselves. ‘Newsmen agree that
the ‘press should ‘ben'critici'zed to
give the public the most unbiased
and representative reporting. The
question is: Who should do the
criticizing?

Some jolr_mali‘sts have ‘said ti!!!’
see no threat to press freedom from
citizens’, groups that have no power
to legislate or improve restrictions.
A New York Times -reporter has
disagreed, saying he fears a sort of
cumulative‘ effect, with various-
ground rules and attempts at
standards proposed’ by press
councils growing into a sort of body
of common law that in reality could
infringe upon the freedom of the
press. I

The First Amendment" of the
U.S. Constitution provides that:

“Congress shall ‘make no law
respecting an establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof, or abridging the
freedomof speech or of the press;

or the right of the people peaceable A

to assemble. and to petition the
government for a redress of

grievances."

Legislators DividedOj\/er Destiny  
Of State Compensation Board  

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG-—The Common-
wealth Compensation Commission
hangs like a wart on
Legislature’s nose. And despite
attempts to get rid of it, the
three-member pay panel is still
there.

“I wish it would just go away,’?
said Rep. Phyllis Kernick, an
Allegheny County Democrat who
led the drive to abolish the
commission and force lawmakers to
vote on all pay raises for
themselves. '

‘‘I don’t see the need for it. The
Commonwealth Compensation

‘ Commission is used as an excuse,” P

she said.
First thing next session, Mrs,

Kernick will re-introduce two’

measures that failed this year—one
to kill the pay panel and another to
make legislators vote on any
proposed raises.

Until then, taxpayers live with
the dread suspicion that the panel
will recommend a pay boost that

Legislature doing anything at all.

Not all lawmakers are at odds
with the controversial board, which
was created three years ago,
because it takes them off the hook
at pay grab time. It can issue a
report recommending a raise. And
if the Legislature fails to reject the
boost within 30 days, it takes effect
automatically.

Thats what happened in 1976,,

when the current salary of $18,720
a year was set. A boost was
recommended, nothing was done,
and the Legislature had a raise
without the embarrassment of
voting itself one.

Se|ectiveService Not Copcibleof Acting In Crisis

By The Associated Press‘-

WASHINGTON—The Selective
Service System is not capable of
mobilizing enough recruits to meet
Pentagon needs in time of a crisis,

'a congressional report said yester-

day. -

Even with the most optimistic
assumptions, the study said, it
would take more than twice as long
as the timetable set by the
Pentagon to deliver the ﬁrst

.recruits to boot camp.

A pessimistic estimate is that it

would take more than three times
as long, according to the report.

“Considering the present short-
falls in our reserve forces, the
present Selective Service situation‘
cannot continue,” Rep. Melvin
Price, D-Ill., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, said in
releasing the report.

Promising Congress will invest-
igate Selective. Service in,its next
term, Price said, “In 1976, the
committee found that the short-
comings in Selective Service were

an unacceptable risk to national
security, and if anything, matters
are worse today,” he said.

Selective Service is now in what
is called “deep standby,” with onlt
98 employees in its national and
regional headquarters, and no state
or local structure. With the
military depending only on volun-
teers, Selective ‘Service does not
register or classify potential re-
cruits. v p -

The system is supposed to be
able to put the first recruits in camp
within 30 days of a mobilization

order and deliver. 100,000 inductees
within two months‘, the study said.

Using optimistic estimates, it
said, it would take 65 days to
deliver the ﬁrst recruits,’ and 90
days to deliver 100,000.

Under a pessimistic set of
assumptions, the first recruits
would not reach training until 95
days after mobilization, and
100,000 recruits would not be
delivered until 120 days after the
ﬁrst order went out, according to
the study. ‘ '

It said Selective Service is
supposed to deliver 650,000 gre-
cruits to training 180 days after

G}.

mobilization, but that it actually’

would take 250 days to deliver that
number under the best of circum-
stances.

Gen. David C. Jones, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
recently the military chiefs are
recommending revival of draft
registration and classification of
military-age youths to improve
mobilization ability. 5

Hall and Oates Defy Expectations

If one were to put the words Hall and Oates together with a concert,
the vision perceived more than likely would consist of an audience of
enthusiastic, wailing pre-adolescent girls worshipping two macho rock
stars and their Top 40 hits. Nothing could be further from the truth,
though, as Hall and Oates electriﬁed a capacity crowd at the Stanley

The show, presented to a predominantly female audience, was
professional at the least. From the lighting work to the musicians, Hall
and Oates put on an extraordinary performance well worth the $8.75

The duo coupled songs ‘from its new album with old favorites and a

After opening the show with a song _from the latest release, “Along
the Red Ledge,” Daryl Hall (who alternated, work on the organ and
electric guitar) sang “Rich Girl” and “Do What You Want To Do.”
From there the pair went into a session of songs that included “I Don’t
Want To Lose You” and the 1960s hit, “My Girl” and was highlighted

The stage then became dark and Hall, before a clouded background,
sang the mellow love song, “August Day.” The rendition featured a
silhouetted sax solo by Charlie De_Shant, who played other woodwind

Hall and Oates then went into a dual -encore of songs from their

however, when Leonardo rises

The first play is set in a charnel
house (a morgue) in 1519. Lasca,
his wife Maria‘ and his son
Alphonso have before them the
prestigious task of embalming the
body of the great Leonardo Da
Vinci. Their task becomes stymied,

The three family members go off
into sundry dialogues. All depict

gets lost in vague analogies, crazed
conversations andpobscure meta-
physics".

Why the devil stirs at noon is
anyone’s guess. Midnight seems
like a more appropriate time. And
besides, how would a monk who

The family of morticians doesn’t
share-his ecstasy, however. After
several unsuccesful attempts to
make deals with him to exploit the
miracle, Leonardo is killed in order
to secure the ever-important profit.

The satire of "‘Leonardo’s Last
Supper” comes across well. That's
more than can be said for the
acting.

Dean Hyland plays Lasca. He
looks like a possessed Steve
Martin, but he slips on far too
many lines.

Romona Fisher as Maria sounds
too punk to be believable for a play

a set in the 16th century, and David

Lindberg is convincing as
Alphonso, but his voice is
unbearably high pitched. Harry
Cohen does well as Leonardo but
it’s hard to criticize an old master.

In “Noonday Demons” the

Crawford and Phil Thomson turn in

their supreme piety to one another
and to themselves.

That connecting link? You’ll
probably find it in St. Eusebius’
monologue at the beginning of the
second play. ‘ ,

In a schizophrenic dialogue with’

himself, he is tempted by the sins
of money, lust and power. He can
have the pleasures of each if only
-he’ll leave the cave and extend his
middle finger to the sky.

That must be it. Money, lust and
power. Three boos for humanity.
Unfortunately, that could be the
connecting link between just about
any two plays.

“Leonardo’s Last Supper” and
“Noonday Demons” are good
overall and worth seeing. But
don’t expect anything that's new or

The songs on “Totally Hot” are
all well done and there is nl ver any

If you think your album

“Totally Hot.” The quality and the

However, it. was Hall and Oates all the ‘way, as the tandem,
combined with powerful lyrics, left the crowd enthused. _

The opening act was City Bay, a group from Birmingham, England,
that should become popular as time progresses. L

Its music, best described as a cross between Queen and Sup.ertramp,
provided the audience with some first-class British rock that did not go
unappreciated. A Lead singers Lol Mason and Steve Broughton

‘captivated the audience with their enthusiasm, and the electric guitar

work of Mike Slamer is among‘ the best Pittsburgh has heard this year.
Playing songs from their latest album, “Book Early,”p and hits from‘

enthusiasm, stage antics, and a tremendous rapport with the crowd. '

ed Muscardelli. “It’s what people
deserve.”

High Society Snacks reflects the .

black and there are "studio lights
high on the ceiling. Above the

entrance there soon _will be a mural’

of a 30s cocktail party painted by
Paul Ellis.

On ‘its shelves, ‘High Society.

Snacks features the best in foreign
and domestic munchies. There are
yogilrts, soaps, crackers, cookies

and candies (including Godiva
Chocolates).

High Society Snacks is‘ more than
just _a food shop, however. The
store is also a showcase of art and
fashion from the 30s and_ 40s.

During an opening party before
Thanksgiving, the store featured a

fashion Show of vintage clothing on '

loan from Yesterday’s News, The
Vamp and Silhouette. The clothes
were modeled by students in the

moved toward a chair. The reason:
he was Pitt’s only big man at the
time.

worn by someone else since‘
basketball began at Pitt this

role and con-.

“We have to make up for the ,_

rebounding. ‘

A prepared Pitt coach Tim
Grgurich, however responded well.
He inserted a short and quick
lineup of Ellis (6-foot-6‘/2 shooting
forward), Carolton Neverson (6-
foot-guard), Knight (6-foot-5 small
forward), Pete Strickland (6-foot
guard) and Dave Olinger (6-foot

15 guard). /

And with that group came a
patterned offense called the
“pitch” that can best be described
as a bunch of Panthers running
around in circles. ~

But it worked. And, when added
to a defense that held the-

Minutement to 22 first-half points, ’

Pitt’s new offense allowed Pitt to
maintain a comfortable lead and
cruise to its ﬁrst league win.

Ellis led Pitt in steals for the
second time this season, with four,

ﬂ'ashing quick hands near the ball.-

“That’s just the defense coach
(Fran) Webster’s been teaching
me,” Ellis said. “He’s been
working with all of us real hard'."’

Several other Panthers noticed
the advantages of a quick, though
small, lineup.

“I think we did pretty well while,
he (Clancy) was out,” said Olinger,
“Even though I had to play a bit of
forward.” —

“Big men might even be a
detriment, the way we .were
playing,” said Neverson, who also
played guard and forward Satur-
day. . “You need ballhandlers and
speed with that offense.”

Pitt wove around Massachusetts’
defense for minutes and twice
freed Knight for layins while
reducing the amount of time Pitt
needed to defend its basket without
Clancy’s assistance.

Massachusetts, who size vwas

Tiger Paul Still Lights a Fire Under Field House Fans    

Some things wereiold and some things were new,

1 but Tiger Paul, the fans still love you.

A When the 1978 edition of the Pitt basketball team
was unveiled at home with 4,732 watching Saturday,

(several tendencies,‘ or their absence, became im-

mediately obvious.

One thing that never may change is the Field
House crowd. When it is written that “4,732 wat-
ched” the basketball game, thatis exa tly what hap-
pened. Students looking for a quiet pleicze to cram for
finals but find Hillman Library overcrowded should
walk up to the Field House any night the Panthers
play at home. For the most part, the handful of
people who think the first floor of the library is a
social center make more noise than the Pitt basket-
ball fans.

Except when Tiger Paul stands in front of the
student section. Although more reserved than he has
been in the past, Paul Auslander remains Pitt’s No. 1
fan. For Sam Clancy to get a reaction out of the
fans, he either has to rattle the foundation with a
dunk or blast an opponents’ shot off the wall with
onesweep of a huge hand. Tiger Paul simply has to
make himself seen for a standing ovation. .

Unfortunately, Auslander’s potential value to the
basketball team never may be: realized_. Digger
Phelps, basketball coach at Notre Dame, readily ad-
mits that an enthusiastic crowd (at South Bend, this

‘usually also means obnoxious) goes a long way in

 

First and Goal

By BOB LABRIOLA

helping the home teampwin games. The Field House
has all the ingredients. for being the scourge of the
visiting team—its age, its size, the fans are relatively
close to the court and half the allotted space is for
students, ‘who are typically more vocal than alumni
or casual fans.

The cheerleaders, no matterwhat they try, are
simply unable; to whip the crowd into a frenzy.
Saturday night, every" time the cheerleaders went out
onto the court, they were greeted, by a smattering of
jeers. While this display shows a lack of class (it
also may indicate the increasing number of
Philadelphia residents admitted to the university),
the message is clear: The fans are not going to
respond to the cheerleaders, but‘they love Tiger Paul.

What has changed, and for the better at that, is the
quality of basketball played in front of all those silent
figures. Gone are the days when the Panthers were a
show with a star and a supporting cast. -More than

.-.any time over the last three years, Pitt has a,basket—
ball TEAM.

The Panthers were supposed to have trouble with

Massachusett’s height with Ed Scheuermann resting
his 6-foot—1l body on the bench with a cast on his
ankle. The Panthers solved this problemby having
everyone play defense and rebound. When Clancy
went to the bench with his third foul, the Panthers
extended their lead with a lineup of mostly guards.

Rather than. being victimized by a ball-hawking
defense and a patterned offense that produces easy
layups, Pitt employed both of these to register its 70-
54 victory. , g

It appears coach Tim',Grgurich finally may have
the cast of characters to follow his script. However,
before the show can be billed as a box office success,
the fans must enjoy and become involved in what is
going on at the Field House. _

The cheerleaders need not play second fiddle; they
should only swallow some of their pride and give the
bull horn to Tiger Paul. The dance routines and the
acrobatics would be preserved, but the apathy of the
fans would not.

No matter how many. television appearances or

national award winners the cheerleaders sport, they --

--are not successful as a unit if the fans do not respond.

After all, the morale of the crowd should be top
priorityrof the cheerleaders, and whatever has to be
done to improve it (as is the case with the basketball

team) should be done. If Tiger Paul continues to be .

ostrasized, boos that currently lack class will become
I well deserved in the future.

Swimmers Open Season with 64-49 Triumph Over Tarheels

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt swim team (1-0) won
nine of 13 events to defeat North
Carolina, 64-49, Thursday at Trees
Pool. , .

Itwas an important win for the

Panthers, who hope to ﬁnish the

season ranked among the nation’s
top 10 teams. North Carolina, a

powerhouse in the rugged Atlantic .

Coast Conference, is considered
one of the strongest teams in the
country.

Finishing ﬁrst for Pitt were

freshman Rick «Carter (50-yard‘

freestyle), Mark Schuman (200-
yard individual medley), Mickey
Termin (100-yard freestyle) and Stu
Swanson (200-yard backstroke).

Pitt's top two divers also won
their events. Pat Greenwell, a
sophomore from Florida, scored
300.8 points in one-meter com-
petition and needs to accumulate at
least 290 points in another meet to
qualify for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association champion-
ships. *

Scott Winkler meanwhile totaled

307.65 points in three-meter
diving, needing 310 points in two
other meets to qualify.

Also ﬁnishing first for Pitt were
both the 400-yard individual
medley relay team (Swanson, Bob
Clemmer, Schuman and Carter)
and the 400-yard freestyle relay
team (Schuman, Termin, Tom
McGinlev and Carter).

TANKER NOTES: With its win
over the Tarheels, Pitt, 10-0 last
season. already may be thinking
about another perfect season. Pit‘,
defeated North Carolina last season
but had to come from behind to do
it. The Tarheels led until the ﬁnal
event...Pitt is coached by Fred
Lewis, who replaced Dick Brad-
shaw this fall.

Panther Hustle Wears Down Taller Minutemen

By MARIA SCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer
For openers, Massachusetts
had a decided height advantage

_ over Pitt, and the Panthers’ tallest,

most experienced inside man
watched the game from the bench
with his left foot wrapped from a
recent operation. Then two
starters committed three fouls each

with more than six minutes to play .

in the ﬁrst half.

So how did this bunch ever
manage to open a 12-point halftime
lead and, for the most part, control

A the game, which they won, 70-54,

Saturday at the Field House.

Pitt was equipped with a ﬁne set
of intangibles: determination,
momentum and a court advantage,
but, most importantly, the Panth-
ers had a great deal of preparation
on hand and used it to/«avenge a

three-point loss to the Minutemen
last season in Amherst.

“Our kids have been prepared
for just about anything this
season,” said coach Tim Grgurich.
“They knew about the possibility of
injuries and loss of starters because
of foul trouble. So when the
situation came up, they were ready
for it. We decided to compensate
for the height disadvantage by
applying pressure at both ends of
the court.”

The same press that resulted in
several forecourt fouls did, how-
ever, allow the Panthers to initiate
a running offense, leaving the tall
but slower Minutemen with a lot of
catching up to do. .

Pitt found it could get by without
Sam Clancy and Wayne Williams if
but for a short while, anyway.
When both picked up three fouls

before halftime, many feared that
Massachusettes would dominate
the boards much as the Panthers
had done against little Rio Grande.
Those fears were put to rest as a
guard-oriented lineup scrambled
for ‘loose balls, picked off errant
passes and continued to do so after
Clancy and Williams re-entered the
game.

“The offense we used tonight
works well with a lot of guards,”
explained guard Carlton Neverson.
“Sometimes it is even a detriment
to have the real tall guys in there to
have it work right. It was OK on
defense, too; we kept them down to
54 points, and that’s pretty good.”

It was Massachusetts’ big men,
however, who were on the
receiving end of Pitt’s fouls.

“At ﬁrst, Sammie Ellis was on
him (the Minutemen’s 6-foot-8,
220-pound Mark Haymore, who led
his team in scoring with 15
points),” said Clancy, ‘_‘but when
Haymore started fronting, I took
him. After that, I picked up some
easy fouls.”

With Clancy out of the game for
a stretch, Ellis “felt a lot of
pressure because I knew I had to
produce.’_’ He led the shorter

I Panther brigade in out rebounding

UMass, 43-26. In two games the
Panthers have collected 111 re-
bounds to their opponents’ 45.

Tomorrow night the Panthers
again must cope with some height

House a roster that includes two
6-foot-10 men.

ByMARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer 5
OK, Bruce’, Jenner fans, what
track event combines the endurance
of distance running, the strength
and _agility of high jumping, the
timing of hurdling and is not the
decathalon? Pitt’s- Randy Bailey
knows the answer. V p
“The steeplechase ' is probably
the most demanding running event
to master,” he said. “It takes so

’ much coordination to combine

hurdling, jumping "and running all
in one race.”

Bailey, who spent most of the 1978
cross-country season as Pitt’s third
man on the squad, starting running

the 3,000 meter steeplechase
outdoors as a "freshman last track

season and, in his first race, not only
won the West Virginia Relays but set
a new meet record as well. His time
of 19:19 qualiﬁed him for the junior
AAU national championships.

“It took me a while to get used to a

plot of -things,” lne said. “First, the

college race is longer (six miles, as

opposed to the high school three),

 

and then there was the adjustment to
running in the city itself. I had been

_so used to working out on golf

coursesjand on quiet back roads that
running down Fifth Avenue was
really a switch.”’ p
4 Actually, the idea of living in the
city and “seeing new faces
everyday,’ was part of the reason
why Bailey decided to come-to Pitt.

“I like having a lot of people
around. My high school graduating
class had something like 150 in it, so I
didn’t want to ‘go to a ‘campus’
school where everyone knows
everybody else,” he explained. _

Cross-country at ‘Neshannock
High School was a successful, major
sport (three WPIAL,and two state
championships during Bailey’s
career), which earned the support_of
the student body. Needless to say,
the runner found the situation at Pitt
to be quite the opposite. I

“It was easy to become motivated
for a race at Neshannock because
there was such tremendous support

and interest in our team,” Bailey"

said, “But it’s not like that here.

. _-"<.:-212' ..:*  ."*'3c * .,.";.:.,. _. f_;.»

' ff‘ '  ' ' A ~' - '7 -'  .'._‘._“j. .552»):-J

Could you imagine a pep rally for

cross-country? Anyway, I guess it grade I put most of my time into golf

was just one more thing to get used
to.”

The popularity of running at
Neshannock was what led Bailey to
begin running in the first place.

' "‘I started‘ running because. I
wanted to be on a winning team; I

;..=_~._-_‘_:_'_._‘..-.<., .._».;_: .-..~;.

hate to lose_,” he said. “Up until 10th

and then basketball but saw that»the
cross-‘country team was doing well,
and I decided to give ita try.

“I must admit that ‘although
running came fairly easy to me, I
didn’t really‘ enjoy my first year
because I found it so hard

physically,’ he added. “But like
anyone who has been running for a
while, it got a lot easier for me, and
now I find that running is not onl-j<,..a
competitive sport, it’s also a chance
to work out my frustrations as well.

“To be a good runner takes a
certain amount of dedication and I
find that this rubs off on other things
as well, like studying.”

Georgia Stings Yellow Jackets, 29-228

By The Associated Press

Two points...two weeks'..;too
late. ' I

That’s the sad story for the
11th-ranked Georgia Bulldogs, who.
trailed Georgia Tech 20-0 late in
the first half and eventually pulled
out a. 29-28 thriller when Anthony
Arnold caught a 42-yard touchdown
pass from Buck Belue with 2:24.
remaining and then ran for a
2-point. conversion. ’ A

game and (2) Georgia could have

‘Near Orlando, at the crossroads of Florida. I-4 and the Florida Tum-pike"-

usec .1 3-pointer two weeks earlier
when (‘mach Vince Dooley, ordered
an e.\;1.x-point "conversion with 5:18
leffand thereby settled for a 22-22
tie with Auburn. , '

A victory then would have put
the Bulldogs in.the Sugar Bowl.
As it'turned out, second-ranked
Alabama slipped past them into the

-Southeastern Conference throne

room Saturday by defeating Au-

‘ burn, 34-16, and setting up a
national championship Sugar Bowl -

shootout against top-rated Penn

‘ State.

’most celebrated -free agent, into

Georgia, meanwhile, will have to
settle for the Bluebonnet Bowl
against Stanford; ‘ ’

Elsewhere, ninth-ranked Hous- '

ton finally made it to the Cottof}
Bowl after stumbling a week ago.
The Cougars trounced Rice 49-25 in
a Saturday night game but actually
made it to Dallas earlier in the day
when Texas Tech, the only other
team with a shot, was crushed by
eighth-ranked Arkansas, 49-7.
Alabama’s triumph gave the
Crimson Tide a head-to-head shot

at the national championship it lost -

so disputedly to Notre Dame a year
ago when five teams finished with
identical 11-1 records.

“Penn State", we can’t wait; Penn _

State, we can’t wait,” the Alabama
players chanted in their dressing
room.

‘ " ‘If we beat Penn State, the No. 1
team, we ought to get it, according
to the way it happened last year,”
said quarterback Jeff Rutledge,

.who broke Joe Namath’s school

record for career touchdown passes
by throwing two to Bruce Bolton
and one to Rick Neal.

That gave him 30-Namath had
28-and also enabled him to tie the
Alabama single-game‘ mark, as
wellas the one-season record of 13
shared by Namath and Harry
Gilmer.

Rose Offered

Horsey Deal  

By The Associated Press

LEXINGTON; Ky.—The Pitts-
burgh Pirates may have the horses
need to carry Pete Rose, baseball’s

their camp. » -

Rose admitted Saturday that he
was fascinated by the offer made
by multi-millionaire John Gal-
breath, owner of Darby Dan Farm

‘ and the Pirates.

The proposal reportedly calls for
Galbreath to sell Rose several
broodmares already in foal -and
give him access to the eight Darby
Dan stallions, worth $20 million or
so. .

V The two men spent several hour?

‘at the farm near here .and both

agreed that any contract would be
for at least three years, perhaps as
many as five.

That would give Rose enough
time to get the National League
record he covets the most—Stan
Musial’s 3,630>career hits. .

Rose stopped short of saying he
would sign with the Pirates but said
he was taking Galbreath’s proposal-
back to Cincinnati and compare it

‘with the offers made by Kansas

City, St. Louis, and Atlanta.
Rose said he would make an

“ax
announcement no later than‘

tomorrow so that the teams he
rejects would be able to make other
deals at baseball’s wirter meeting

next week in Florida.
