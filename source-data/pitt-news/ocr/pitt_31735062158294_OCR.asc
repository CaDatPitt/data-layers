SGA M6ml).ers
Disagree About
Grid Ducat Poll

A motion to‘ conduct’ a_stu-
dent opinion poll; has left

SGA ‘uncertain as to proced-
ure, and discussion again was

it opened at last Mondayls meet-

ing. . V .
Tom Ribich felt that it was not
necessaryto take this poll con-
cerning admission and seating ar-
rangements for varsity football
games since little would be gain-
ed. “I think we know the general
feeling of the students,” he said.
Dennis Lichtman felt that SGA
should take a ﬁrm stand on the
issue-. “I see _no reason why a stu-
dent has to pay, to see ‘a football
game just because some students
don’t attend the games.

“This is an important part of
the University. I’m 'quite sure
that many Pitt students don’t
use the University library;
however, if they were to charge .-
a fee for taking out books not
many students would borrow
books; suchcis the case of the
football games. ’ '

The advantages and disadvan-
tages were discussed; however it
is certain that‘ the poll will be
taken and deﬁnite_action will be
taken with the Athletic Depart-
ment by Jan. 31. ‘ '

Kent Jarrell brought“ up the
question of Pitt's joining Who's
Who in American _Colleges and
Universities. He feels it will help
stir up student interest in activi-
ties and also be good for voca-
tional opportunities.

Ribich‘ however felt that it
was not consistent with the
general aims of the University
.'since most of the “Big Ten" do
not" belong to this publication. ’

Lois Capin. suggested that fu-
ture elections to SGA be put’ in
the hands of a nominating com-
mittee that would be_ responsible

. for electing candidates "to SGA.

- In answer te thisf Lichtman

ly in the best interests of the

- students -and that all organizations

should be permitted to put‘ up a
candidate for SGA. No decision
was reached on this issue.

ance.” -

Admission to the program is

‘Library Opens Open Book Stacks

..._,¢-*

‘-9.

(Continued from Page 1)‘

General botany, astronomy, ge-
ology, physics, chemistry and
mathematics books are included.
Students desiring speciﬁc books
will still have to go to the card
catalog on the ﬁfth ﬂoor.

Books are classiﬁed according
to topics. A large map at the en-
trance shows where particular
books are located. Small hand
guides to the stacks are also
available at the entrance. Stu-
dents may look at the books as
long as they desire and then to
take their selection to the check
out desk where they will show
their ID or registration card.

Less Staff Needed

The new open stack area uses
a super market style with one en-
trance and one exit with a check-
out 'desk. Fewer people will be
needed to staff the room. Ap-
proximately two persons will
work at the desk and a few pages
will be used to ﬁll the shelves.

All the books were moved
with the paid help of 14 stu-
dents during the two-week
Christmas vacation. By inext
fall, it is hoped two more ﬂoors
will be added doubling the cur-
rent amount of space. The new
capacity would be 220,000
books.

This new area was added be-
cause the University cannot 'p0S-K
sibly have a new library com-
pleted before 5 years and it has
been impossible to have an ade-
quate amount of books with the
present quarters. *

Installation by Remington-Rand

The stack is 97 percent mobile
and enables re—arrange_ment of
the whole stack. It was installed
by Remington-Rand, library spe-
cialists for many years.

The Remington-Rand design-
ers worked with University
planners. Together they were

ﬁfth ﬂoor.

BOOK DEPOSITS are made by Robert Surdick (left) and Mel
Barnwell at the new slots provided for this purposein the base-
ment and on the ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral. The new facilities
will allow students to make book deposits without going to the

able to put in many more books
than thought possible. V

The plans were completed last
February for the open stacks.
This idea is a new one having
originated in the last few years,
and is the trend among colleges
today.

‘New Book Deposits

New book deposits have been
placed on the ground ﬂoor and on
the basement ﬂoor to enable stu-
dents to return books without go-
ing to the fifth ﬂoor.

The stacks are open to all stu-
dents. The hoursifor the ﬁrst
semester are Monday-Thursday.
8 a.m.-9 p.m.; Friday 8 a.m.-6
p.m. and Saturday 8:30 a.m.-5
p.m. Second semester hours will

a

be‘ Monday-Friday, 3 a.m.-10
p.m. with Saturday remaining
the same..

Lorena Garloch, the head li-

brarian,\ said, “The University has
been criticized for low student use
of the library but I’m sure with
new modern stacks available, stu-
dent use will increase.” _

There. will be no trained li-
brarians in the stacks.’ Students
are reminded that help _may be

had from the six professional li-

brarians in the Reference Room
on the ﬁfth ﬂoor.

Periodicals will still be on the
ﬁfth ﬂoor and all _current litera-
ture from 1956 will be in the Al-
dred Room with the spoken rec-
ord collection.

After the Worker claims that the French de-
valuation of currency and “ﬁnagling” with the
currency ‘elsewhere in Western Europe is taking

newspaper goes on to comment about the beauties

‘some degree of subtlety. A few people do-sub-

‘ f The Board of Advisors of the

School of the Liberal Arts ‘was
created to help every student‘ in
the Lower Division (freshmen
and sophomores) to utilize, his
academic _opportunities to the

the Board is toassist all fresh-

- men and ﬁrst semester sopho-

For this purpose the Board’s

secretary reviewed the student’s

Office and, selected a time when

Under the old system of regis-

could be chosen by the student,
we have known many students
whose basis for selecting a par-
ticular course was that it-was

held between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' '~'~

on Monday, Wednesday, and Fri-
day. A few enterprising students
did obtain very desirable sch-

well-oriented program. With the

classes we believe more students

Wrdestlers Aim
To Make Terps

Second Victim

Matinen Take Opener

Over Michigan, 223-7;

Cop Third Wilkes Title

By TED COLTON

With one victory already
tucked under their belts the
Panther matmen will try for
two in a row Saturday when

they face Maryland at the ~l

Field House at 7 p.m. The

match will precede the Panther-
Syracuse basketball game which is

scheduled to get under way at ' ' .

8:30 p.m.

This will be the third meeting
between the two, and the men
from the Southern state are still
looking for their ﬁrst victory.

» In the.ﬁrst two matches between
the schools the Panthers have
scored a total of 47 points com-
pared to 12 for the Terrapins.
The Panthers posted their vic-
tor.ies in 1957 (26-4) and 1958
(21-8).

Moyer Takes Toughy

Michigan was unable to provide
the Peerymen with capable com-
petition last Saturday as the Pan-
thers completely outclassed the
Wolverines, 23-7. p

The Wolverines were never in
the meet as the Panthers scored
victories in the ﬁrst ﬁve matches.

The most exciting match was in

the 137-lb. class when Sherman

Moyer of the Jungle Cats pinned

VVill Hildebrandt with only

eight seconds left in the match

and the score tied.

Paul Powell, 123-lb. NCAA.
champion, won the ﬁrst match
when Mike Hoyles of Michigan
failed to make the 123 lb. weight.
In the 130-lb. class sophomore
Larry Lauchle defeated Larry‘
Murray of Michigan, 8 to 3.

Bubb, Skirpan Win

Bob Bubb and Alex Skirpan
completed the sweep of the ﬁrst
ﬁve matches for the Panthers as
they defeated Jim Blaker and Don
Corriere by the scores of 3 to 0,
and .:4 to 1 in the 147-lb. and 157-
lb. classes, respectively. /_

In the 167-lb. class Tom Al-
berts and the Wolverines Den-
nis Fitzgerald staged a thrilling

After a month of rest——since
their 48-38 win over Maryland-
the Panther mermen will open
their home season against North
Carolina State Saturday. The
tankers with an “up-and-coming»

splashed their way to a'57-29 vic-
tory.

Howard Tresser and Jim Emert,
both \sophomores, sparked the
tankers in the Maryland meet as
they won three events between
them and were on the two win,-
ning relay teams.

“We are anticipating a very
tough season this year but the
team morale is high after the
Maryland win, and if it stays that
way I am quite sure we will give
a good accounting of ourselves,”
Coach Ben Grady commented.

H o u s e. “Will
lack of depth
hurt us again
this year?”

Last season a
weak third man
in some of the
events led to
the gymnasts downfall in meets
with Army, Navy, and Penn State,
and that is the main reason why
the Panthers could ﬁnish no higher
than fourth in the Eastern Gym-
nastics League, which also .- in-
cludes Syracuse and Temple.

This is also.the seventh season
that the Panthers have had a gym-
nastics team. Neiger was the man
selected by Athletic Director Tom
Hamilton to assemble the team
and has been quite successful.

The Panthers will be starting

their sixth season in the EIGL.

For the last two campaigns Nei-
ger’s boys have recorded inden-
tical 6-3 records in dual-meet
competition.

In the Eastern Tourney, they
ﬁnished third in 1957 and second
in 1958 while in the Nationals the
Panthers have been among the top
ten teams for the last two seasons.
The schedule lists only six dual
meets for the Blue and Gold in
1959.

“We ran into a lot of difficulty
in making up the schedule and
that is why it will be short and
to the point,” Neiger commented.
This season’s opponents are
Army, Navy, Temple, Syracuse,
West Virginia and Penn State.

Syracuse will be the ﬁrst op-
ponents for the gymnasts at Syr-
acuse on Jan. 17. West Virginia and
Temple also will be met abroad
while Army, Penn State, and Navy,
will put in appearances at the
Field House..

The biggest losses from last
year’s squad are the two co—cap-
tains, Tom Darling and Jim Mul-
vihill. Mulvihill (was an Eastern
champion on the high bar while
Darling "took two consecutive, ﬂy-

’ - ,- - ~ ,:'- '-.1»

ing rings titlesin both the East-
erns and Nationals.

Cp-captains for the 1959 squad
are seniors Don Neeld and John
Cacolice. Neeld is ah excellent
tumbler and just missed the
title in the Easterns last season
while \Cacolice is Neiger’s lead-
ing rope climber. ’

Much of this year’s success will
depend on junior Dave Hirst.
Hirst missed all of the 1958 season
due to an arm injury that required
surgery. He was the leading
scorer as a sophomore and will
compete in tumbling, high bar,
and flying -rings this season.

Rounding out the rope climb-
ing brigade are John Felman
and Joe Battaglia. Battaglia also
takes part in tumbling andthe
rings. Tom Treese performs on
the ﬂying rings while Bill Cau-
ley and John Kadlecik compete
in the side horse and parallel
bar events, respectively.

Neiger has two iron-man per-
formers who both come from Mc-
Keesport. They are Don Kasner
and John Marcinko. 'Both men
will work the side horse, parallel
bar, and high bar events for the
Panthers. John Rainaldi may also
work the high bar. ’

Syracuse Comes Here Saturday With 7-2;
Cincebox, Goldberg Ready to Face Hennon
By LARRY HAGGERTY

“If we can play 40 minutes of good basketball, we can
beat Temple,” Panther Coach Bob Timmons declared before
his hoopsters left for Philadelphia for tonight’s game in the

Palestra with the Owls.

The Blue and Gold have been having a difficult time win-
ning away from home. Their only triumph to date abroad was

St. Louis Beats
Locals, 79-62

In Dull Contest

The St. Loiiis Billikens led
all but for the ﬁrst minute as
they downed the Panthers in
a dull game at the Field
House last Monday night, 79-
62. Except for a 1-0 Panther
lead, St. Louis never trailed. They
led at halftime 40-26.

The one bright spot, as usual,
for the outclassed Blue and Gold
of Coach Bob Timmons was the
performance of All—American
Guard Don Hennon. Hennon was
the leading scorer for the night
with 30 points. The Billikens’ high
men were Bob Ferry and Pete
McCaffrey with 16 and 14 tal-
lies, respectively. “

It was felt that the home court
advantage the Jungle Cats owned
might enable them to upset the
11th ranked squad of Coach John
Bennington, but it just wasn’t the
Panthers’ night.

Timmons had very little to

say in the dressing room fol-
lowing the tilt. “I feel that our
sophomores made too many
mistakes out there. Also we
missed the services of , John
Mills for grabbing those import-
ant rebounds,” added Timmons.

Mills turned an ankle midway
through the ﬁrst half and missed
the rest of the game. In his place
Timmons inserted another sopho-
more, 6-7 Don Keller, of Greens-
burg. Keller scored four points
but did not help much in re-
bounding. ‘ '

The comments on Hennon’s

outstanding performance varied
in the victorious Billiken locker
room.xJim Dailey, who ‘had the
job of guarding the Panther
All-American, shouted, “Hen-
non is a lousy - - -; nearly all
of his shots were lucky.” Dailey,
Hennon
registered all of his points
(Continued on Page 7)

vover Clemson in the Carrousel

Tourney at Charlotte, N. C.

Timmons "listed several factors
as to why his Jungle Cats have
been so disappointing up until
now. “First,” Timmons said, “we
have been very weak off both
boardsand the only two boys that
have done at least a half—de_cent
job ‘of rebounding for us are John
Fridley and John Mills.

Lack Height

“Our size has been hurting us,
but I can’t play Dave Sawyer very
much any more because it seems
as though he has developed a case
of ‘senioritis.’ Sawyer hasn’t given
us a good game since the Du-
quesne contest.

“I’ve had to bench Dick Fa-
lenski because he is making too
many mistakes and I can’t use
Francis Kondrad because he
won’t rebound even though he_
is the tallest boy on the present
squad. Also this team was never

» a group that worked well to-

gether,” the Jungle Cat tutor
continued.

Temple, meanwhile, r e t u r n s
from one of the greatest seasons
in its history. The Owls captured
27 of 30 contests last season. They
lost, however, ﬁve of the ﬁrst six
men.

Kennedy Replaces Guy

So this has naturally been a
campaign of rebuilding for Coach
Harry Litwack, and the recon-
struction is being done around the
lone returning starter Bill Ken.-
nedy (5-11), whom Litwack is
grooming ' in the image of All-
American‘Guy Rodgers.

Like Rodgers, Kennedy has
tremendous speed, can go either
way, is an excellent ballhandler,
and has a good shot. As a soph-
omore last season he averaged
13.5 points per game to rank
second on the Owl team. In last
year’s game with the Panthers,
which Temple won, 76-71, he
outscored Don Hennon, 22 points
to 18. -

Starting besides Kennedy for
the Owls will be Forwards Bernie
Ivens (6-2) and Ophie Franklin
(6-4), Center Pete Goss (6-7), and
Guard Joe Goldenburg (5-7).

Indiana J V ’s Down
Hoop Cubs, 78-59

By JACK SNHTH

Indiana Teachers JV basketball team took an early lead
and was never headed as it coasted to an easy 78-59 win over
the Panther frosh, Monday night at the Field House.

Led by the scoring of George Wise, Indiana held a 41-29
halftime advantage. Faulty ballhandling on the part of the
cubs enabled Indiana to increase its lead to 19~points at the

Panthers Face

Temple Tonite

(Continued from Page 6)

The reason that Timmons be-
lieves that. his boys have a good
chance to win is the fact that
Temple has captured only two of
their nine games to date. They
have trimmed Gettysburg and
Muhlenberg while losing to Le-
high, Kentucy, Princeton, Rutgers,
Villanova, Connecticut, and St.
Johns. I

' Donnie Awaits Orange

The Blue and Gold’s next home
attraction is slated for the Field
House this Saturday evening at
8:30 p.m. when the hoopsters face
the highly rated Orangemen of
Syracuse. This is the one game
that Skyscraper U. All-American
Hennon has been waiting for all
season. -

Last year at Syracuse Hennon
was assigned to cover the Or-
an'ge’s Ed Goldberg (5-10) and
vice versa. It seems the two
players were engaged in several
elbowing duels which the two
oﬁic/ials failed to notice: Hennon
didn’t care for this at all.

“If -I would try to strike back,”
Hennon recalls, “the officials
would call a foul on me; but let
Goldberg elbow me-and the ref-
eree would conveniently have his
back turned. Goldberg averaged
15.5 points per game for the 1957-
58 campaign.

Syracuse is led, however, by
6-7 Center Jon Cincebox who
tallied just under 20 points per
contest. Cincebox is a strong
rebounder and Orange Coach
Marc Guley considers his star
center a likely All-American
candidate.

Rounding out the starting ﬁve
are Forwards Pete Chudy (6-4)
and Tom Mossey (6-5) and Guard
Bruce Schmelzer (6-1). Chudy, a
sophomore, averaged 25 points a
game as a fresmman last year.
The Syracuse record to date is
7-2, and they are ranked nation-
ally in the top 20. The Panthers
won last year’s game by a 71-68
score;

¢ﬁnal buzzer.

Wise led Indiana with 20 points.
Bob Darling and Richard Crooks
added 15 and 14 points, respec-
tively.

Joe Schinitski was high man
for the fresh with 14 points.
Schinitski points came on jump
shots from around the key. Dick
Sankey had 12 points for the
losers.

The Panthers, playing their ﬁrst
game in two weeks, had trouble
with passing and ball control. It
was‘ evident from the opening
minutes of the game that ball con-
trol would be a factor, and the
Indiana JV’s.capitalized on every

break.

“A few of the boys played good
ball,” Coach Carl Peterson said,
“but I’m afraid the two weeks
layoff We had hurt the team. I’m
sure by our next game the boys
will be back in shape.”

Bemis Searches
For Weightlifters
To Form Squad‘ I

For the second straight year
Coach Leo Bemis has been put in
charge of the Panther weightlift-
ing club. ‘Workouts are held be-
tween 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. on week-
days. The club now has 25 mem-
bers. '

As part of the Pitstburgh Bi-
centennial Celebration the 1959
Collegiate Internationals will be
held at the Field House and Bemis
is anxious to “ﬁeld a team from
Skyscraper U. . .

Last year Ken Smythe, a mem-
ber of the club, won the Inter-
collegiate heavyweight champion-
ship, AMA Novice and Junior
meet, and the YMHA and YMCA
Championships.

The classes for the meet will
be 123 lb., 132 1b., 148 1b., 165 lb.,
181 1b., 198 1b., and heavyweight.
Anyone interested “should get in

tie. As the ﬁnal buzzer sounded
Alberts was awarded two points
that would have given him the
match. But the oﬁicial scorers
agreed that the points were
awarded after the buzzer.
Michigan’s victory came in the
177—1b. class when Karl Fink de-
feated the Panthers Len Vuocolo,
7-4. In the heavyweight division
the Wolverines were able to hold
the Peerymen to another tie as
Fred Olm wrestled the Panthers’

Coach Bennington disagreed
with his player and went along
with the consensus of the 1,396
fans present. “Hennon is truly an
All-American. I thought he was
tremendous against us last year in
St. Louis, but he seems to have
improved almost 100 percent since
then,” Bennington said.

The only time the Panthers
were in the game in the second

In that time Dave Sawyer, Hen-
non, and Dick Falenski scored
eight quick points and brought
the hosts to within six points, 40-
