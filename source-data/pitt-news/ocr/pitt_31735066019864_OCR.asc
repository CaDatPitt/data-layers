Questions
raised in
research

ﬁaud  

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

The recent indictment of Dr.
Stephen Breuning, a former
researcher at Western Psychiatric
Institute, for falsifying research
data, opens up many questions as
to the regulations and supervision
of research.

A federal grand jury in
Maryland charged Breuning, who
resides in Shaler, with two counts
of making false statements and
one count of corruptly obstruct-
ing an investigation.

In addition, the jury held that
Breuning falsely informed inves-
tigators that the incorrect informa-
tion was appended in another
file.

Breuning’s questionable
research was done at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Medical School
from 1982 to 1984.

Dr. Robert L. Sprague, a profes-
sor at the University of Illinois at
Champaign—Urbana, said he was
the first to suspect Breuning of
wrong—doing.

The alleged falsificaton oc-
curred with funds Breuning had
received at the Psychiatric Insti-
tute through Pitt.

On Sept. 22, 1983, Sprague
said he visited Breuning, whom
he had previously worked with
and ”one of the things he showed
me was a progress report. These
are required if you have a feder-
al grant.”

Sprague commented, “The
primary problem [with his report]
was that he claimed to have run
273 experiment days, and in that
year there were only 260 work-
ing days.”

He added that if Breuning’s
report was to be plausible, there
would of have to have been ”no
mishaps, no people getting sick
and no equipment breaking
down [in that year].

’’In the real world,” Sprague
said, ”this doesn't happen.”

On December 20, 1983,

I Sprague wrote a letter to the Na-

tional Mental Health Institute. He
said the letter contained six pages
of text, as well as 43 pages of ap-
pendicies of what he saw wrong
with Breuning’s findings.

After this, NIMH contacted Pitt
and an investigation was intiated.
However, as Sprague explained,
”The NIMH played around with
the the investigation for three and

a half years before they issued

New billt

By Diana Smith ’

Associated Press Writer

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The
furor over what happened to
$980,310 donated to help Ron-
nie DeSillers get a liver transplant
prompted a Senate committee
Wednesday to approve a bill to
establish stricter regulations of
charitable contributions.

The 7-year-old Miami boy died
last April while awaiting his
fourth liver transplant at Chil-
dren's Hospital in Pittsburgh.

Earlier this year, that state filed
an administrative complaint
against his mother, accusing her
of violating the state's charity law
by using some of the funds to pay
personal expenses, including rent
and a car telephone.

She was fined $1,000 but may

puters.

He first created and distributed
keyboards for the blind, which
impersonate and reproduce mil-
lions of different sounds. Several
blind musicians such as Stevie
Wonder and Jose Feliciano have
utilized the system. —

Perhaps the most famous of his
inventions was his next accom-
plishment, the Reading Machine
for the Blind, which enables the
visually impaired to read even if
they don't know Braille. The
machine is run over material writ-
ten in Braille and reads aloud
what is run over. I

. Also, he has produced an ap-

paratus called ”Voiceworks,”
which works as a reverse type-
writer. The user speaks into the
machine and the computer acti-
vates the commands spoken into
It.

Hoping that his new product
will be found throughout the
globe, Kurzweil said, ”lt’s excit-
ing for me to see technology
moving the world.”

Kurzweil Computer Products’
Pittsburgh distributor, Comdoc
Office System, is holding a
demonstration of the ”Discover”
at the Pittsburgh Hilton on April
27 and 28.

Comdoc said he is confident
that this system will be of benefit
to colleges and campuses in Pitts-
burgh, as well ones across
America.

Comdoc Senior Account Ex-
ecutive David A. Fisher said,
”We’ve had a lot of calls from the
university about the Kurzweil
product."

He also said , he envisioned
”many applications for students
at Pitt."

Individuals interested in attend-
ing a demonstration shou|d,con-

regulate charitable contributions

contest the fine at a May 10 hear-
ing in Dade County, said David
Adams, spokesman for the
Department of State.

Current state law says a charita-
ble account opened for a
beneficiary should be used only
for that person.

Maria DeSillers has denied any
wrongdoing, saying she doubted
the accuracy of a state audit that
showed she had received
$980,310 in donations for her
son's liver transplant and related
medical expenses. The donations
included $1,000 from President
Reagan and $32,000 from sailors

aboard the USS John F. Kennedy.’

Sen. Mattox Hair, D-
Jacksonville, said the case has
pointed out a need for better state
supervision of funds set up for
transplant patients and others.

In cases that draw national at-

-tention like Ronnie's, family

members are sometimes thrust
into the role of handling thou-
sands of dollars in donations
mailed from all over the country.

”A lot of these monies, the
funds received and expenditures
made, were not well document-
ed,” Hair said of the DeSillers’
case. ”The monies were used for
rental payments, for lawyers, for
personal expenses, and I under-
stand even some of the checks
were written to cash.

The bill (SB 380) approved
unanimously by the Senate Ap-
propriations Committee would
apply to people who collect
$10,000 or more in donations.

The legislation specifies that no
more than 20 percent of the do-
nations can be used for adminis-

trative costs and living expenses
and describes unused portions
should be distributed backto the
donors on a pro rata basis.

A trust fund would have to be
established in the name of the
person for whom the donations
were intended. Lists of the
donors, their addresses and the
amounts of money would have to
be filed with the secretary of
state's office. Such records would
be considered public documents.

A first-time violation would
result in a second-degree mis-
demeanor, punishable by 60
days in jail, a $500 fine or both.
Subsequent violations are punish-
able by a year in jail, a $1,000
fine or both.

The legislation now goes to the
Senate floor.

New Pa. poll shows Dukakis will crush Jackson

PHILADELPHIA —- Mas-
sachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the frontrunner for the
Democratic presidential nomina-
tion, has an overwhelming lead
in next Tuesday's race for 178
delegates in next Tuesday's state

primary,-according to a new poll

released Wednesday.

The Pennsylvania Poll, com-
missioned by the Philadelphia
Daily News and the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, questioned 647
Democrats last weekend. The
results showed Dukakis statewide
has 59 percent compared to 20
percent for Jesse Jackson, nine
percent for Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee, and undecided eight
percent.

Of those who responded to the
survey and said they planned to
vote, Dukakis had support from
57 percent, Jackson 23 percent,
Gore 12 percent and 12 percent
still undecided.

Sampling error was plus or mi-
nus four percentage points over-
all, or five points among the 411
persons who identified them-
selves as most likely voters.

In addition to the 178 delegates

to be chosen in the state’s 23 con-
gressional districts there will be
14 so-called ”super delegates” to
be named later, including Gov.
Robert Casey and other party
leaders.

NEWS BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED PRESS

 

”The poll showed Dukakis
with support of more than half
the Democrats, including every
age, religious and income group
and in every section of the state
except the city of Philadelphia,”
the newspapers reported. It also
showed Dukakis as the strongest
Democrat in head—to—head match-
ups with likely Republican
nominee George Bush.

”Dukakis is the only Democrat-
ic candidate to lead Bush am?-a 3
Democrats who think Pres‘  ‘.
Reagan has been good for -.;-.2
country.”

The poll showed that Dukakis,
among the Democrats surveyed,
was liked him 76 percent to 16
percent over Bush, while Gore
had a 57-29 advantage over Bush

and Jackson, 50-38.

Lloyd's raises gulf
rates by 100 percent

LONDON — Lloyd's of Lon-
don insurers are charging twice
as much to insure ships sailing
the Persian Gulf after U.S. and
Iranian forces clashed in the
waterway earlier this week, a
spokesman said Wednesday.

The war-risk premium doubled
Tuesday to 2 percent, said the
spokesman. For a 14-day voyage
to Kuwait, insurance doubled to
$200,000 on a $10 million hull.

’’It’s in response to the recent
incidents inthe gulf,” he said. ”I
think the [gulf insurance] rates
have moved in fits and starts. If
we have one or two weeks
without major incidents, I think
they'll go down again.”

Cargo insurance premiums re-

rmained largely unchanged, he

said

For voyages to ports of Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates in the southern gulf, the
rate doubled to 1.5 percent of the
value of a hull from 0.75 percent,

said the spokesman, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. Navy sank or
damaged six Iranian vessels and
destroyed two offshore oil plat-
forms Monday. It was the biggest
skirmish with the Iranians since
the U.S. Navy began escorting
I Kuwaiti ships in the gulf in July
last year. Iran claimed it downed
a helicopter.

Casey signs p tough
new anti-abuse law

HARRISBURG —— Legislation
that toughens a state law protect-
ing people from domestic vio-
lence and other abuses was
signed Wednesday by Gov.
Robert P. Casey.

The revised law expands defi-
nitions to include abuse by a sex-
ual partner and abuse by a
sibling. It would also provide
confidentiality to victims of
domestic violence.

The legislation, sponsored by
Rep. Joseph Lashinger, R-
Montgomery, goes into effect in
60 days.

The Student Committee for
a Free Afghanistan, a new stu-

ly certified this week and plans
to ultimately sponsor a volun-
teer medical team to work in
Pakistan.

According to Mark Brown,
chairman and field director,
”based on the large medical
community at Pitt, we hope to
find people who will spend six
months or more over there.

”Whether or not the war
ends, there will be a lot of

dent organization, was official- ’

wounded Afghanis. They need
medical people and, as right
now, there's a shortage [of
medical personnel].”

Brown, who has been to Af-
ghanistan, said he started the
SCFA because he's sympathet-
ic to the Afghani cause.

"The Soviets are committing
genocide on the Afghani peo-
ple,” said Brown.

Brown said the two short
range goals of the SCFA are to
sponsor a fact-finding mission
to Afghanistan and to find out
whether the Soviets will divest
from Afghanistan or not.

SCFA has requested $3,000
from the Student Government

Board to fund the ”fact-
finding” mission to Af-
ghanistan.

Craig Jackson, SGB presi-
dent, said ”We’ve never had
a group come in that wanted
to go overseas. It's a unique re-
quest. I’m not sure what we
can do.”

Jackson said that he feels
this is "a unique opportunity
for Pitt students to find, out
what's going on in Af-
ghanistan” and that this group
is definitely an ”educational,

not social” organization.

SCFA’s faculty sponsor is
Dr. Richard Cottam of the
university's political science
dept. He has also gone to Af-
ghanistan.

Cottam was unavailable for
comment.

”They [SCFA] havevone of
the biggest sponsors here,”
said Jackson.

Brown said SCFA will be
planning fund-raising activities
to offer ”non-lethal, hu-
manitarian aid” to the Afgha-
ni rebels and refugees.

”We’re interested in send-

Student group wants $3,000 to aid Afghanistan  

ing blankets, clothing and
medical aid to them," said
Brown, ”not guns and ammu-
nition.

”I’m very enthused and so
are my committee members.
It's important that the Ameri-
can public learns what's going
on in Afghanistan,” said
Brown.

”I’m really hoping I'll get the
money for the ‘fact-finding’
mission,” said Brown. ’’I’d like
to be in place by May 15 to a
tell the world whether or not
the ‘peace accords’ are disin-
formation or not.”

Corporate Executives Donald I.
Moritz, Jack McGregor and J.
Bruce Johnston, all graduates of
Pitt's law school, offered their
views on attorneys in corporate
business in a panel discussion in
the Templitz Courtroom of Pitt's
Law School Building.

”Attorneys move ahead in cor-
porations because of the back-
ground they are given here [in
law school] in decision making,”
said Moritz, chief executive
officer of Equitable Resources,
Inc.

”The corporate road is an ex-
cellent one to move up the lad-
der if you have that in mind,”
Moritz said.

Johnston left Harvard Law
School after his first year in ord-

of his father. ”I thought the
school [Pitt's School of Law] was

”and, of course, it has gotten
even better.”

Johnston told the law school
students in attendance that in cor-

way they do on law school ex-
aminations.”

Dukakis looks like
the bestcandidate

After presidential candidate Michael Duakakis’ clear-cut vic-
tory in New York, it appears as though he will be the Democrats’
choice in Atlanta. In what pollsters described as ”heavy” turn-
out, Dukakis came up with nearly double the number of
delegates of his nearest competitor, Jesse Jackson. Albert Gore,
whose campaign has been marginal at best since Super Tues-
day, vowed to stay in the race despite a dismal third place finish.

Dukakis has made it through his most difficult tests, in the
major urban centers of Illinois and New York. With Pennsyl-
vania, Ohio and Indiana still to come — all of which have demo-
graphics more favorable to Dukakis than New York — Dukakis
is virtually assured of overwhelming support at the convention.

' When the Pennsylvania primaries commence, Dukakis should,

judging from his 3-1 lead in polls here, sail to another decisive
victory.

The question of a running mate, among both the democrats
and republicans, is one that is best left to the conventions. Be-
cause of the large number of possibilities on both sides, an at-
tempt at prediction would surely be an excercise in futility.

As a result of the New York vote, it now becomes necessary
to examine the most likely presidential ticket for November,
George Bush and Michael Dukakis. Bush clearly has more ex-
perience in the machinations of the federal government.

‘ Dukakis has demonstrated more decisive managerial skills.

It is difficult, some say impossible, to predict the attributes
which will best serve a potential president. The crises he will
face have yet to materialize, the pressures have yet to develop.
However, at first glance, Bush is faring much worse in the
eastern United States, a traditionally working-class electorate,
than his most likely opponent. Actually, in a poll conducted
by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Philidelphia Daily News,
Bush came out on the losing end of a large number of possible
choices. He was seen as less acceptable than Jackson, Dukakis,

Core and even Mario Cuomo.

So far, Dukakis has appeared to be the least reactionary of
the candidates, the most level-headed. He staged no fiasco com-
parable to Bush's argument with Dan Rather. There have been
no angry accusations of spiteful voting. With the exception of
the Biden tapes released by a Dukakis campaign aide, his cam-
poaign record has been impeccable.

At this point, Dukakis seems to be the best choice for the
November election. Bush, for all his experience, lacks the neces-
sary strength of conviction that has marked our greatest leaders.

Sports al|—stars were skewed

Good job Pitt News sport staff
in choosing, the very masculine,
All-Pitt News team. Yes, you did
pick two female runners-up, Lisa
Stewart and Lorri Johnson. I con-
gratulate you on your choices.
However, Lisa definitely
deserved to be ranked higher on
the team than just runner-up.

In support of my argument, she
received MVP in the Big East
tournament, All-Big East team,
Yugo East-West All Star Classic,
Chamber of Commerce Female
Athlete, Division I team volley-
ball, MVP in the Ohio Classic
tournament and shared the senior
female athlete award. Note that
all of these accomplishments
were done this year. Of course
the awards were not listed in the
article. In fact, I didn't see any
profile on Lisa Stewart. Huh, I
wonder why?

Lisa is also still attending the
university. Amazing that she is a
runner—up. I guess if she had quit
the university, after criminal
charges had been pressed (and
don't forget dropped), then
turned pro, she would have made
the first team without question.

Could it be that since Lisa is fe-
male, and plays on a team that
does not receive much publicity,
that she only ranks as a runner-
up, according to the Pitt News
sports staff? No, a school
newspaper could not allow itself
to have such a bias. Could it?

Surely the fact that every single
contributing writer listed under
the article was male is simply a
coincidence.

I apologize ifl have in any way
embarrassed Lisa Stewart. I just
think she deserves more credit
than The Pitt News gave her. In
the future, I hope The Pitt News
will be more careful to give credit

Sell the dead’

I am writing in support of Scot
Ross’ article ”The crypt is a
monumental waste.” For as long
as I can remember, the burial ritu-
al has seemed an utter absurdity
to me. Passing the Flushing, New
York cemetery as a kid used to
give me nightmares, with all its
grey tombstones stacked one next
to the other for miles, lining the
highway like a border of stakes
with skulls above them. Why?
Ritual.

It is my belief that as popula-
tions soar, and as inflation grows

-and grows, the ritual of casket,

plot and tombstone burials will.
become as archaic and ignoble as
hunting buffaloes for their
tongues.

I will go one step further than
Mr. Ross in proposing more
utilitarian methods of burial and
body disposal which I feel are
even less of a burden both finan-
cially and environmentally than
Mr. Ross’ remedy of cremation (a
great waste of vital energy, in my
opinion). First, why not sell the
human body which, if still sound
and whole, is a plethora of need-
ed organs for the living. Organs
will grow in value each year as
transplant surgery moves toward
routine operation status. [...J

For the lesser quality cadaver,
there is science — always in need
of good experimental tissue and
willing to pay for it. Finally, in-
dustry. The body is a rich source
of phosphate and other valuable
minerals which are, no doubt,
easily exploitable by today's tech-
nological resourcefulness.

Though all of these ideas I have
offered are quite viable and for-
seeable, I am, nonetheless, a
romantic at heart and if I had my
druthers, I would want my body
disposed of as all Tibetian monks’
bodies are disposed of — they are
carried to the summit of a high
mountain, rended into quarters
and left for the fauna to feast
upon.

Missing the point

As usual, you all missed the
point. The Soviet imperialists
have begun to depart Afghanistan
with their tails between their legs
because Reagan went beyond
boycotting the Olympics or ban-
ning the sale of wheat to feed
hungry Soviet livestock. Going
beyond the support of the Muja—
hideen that Carter began, the
Congress and the President
armed the Afghan freedom fight-
ers with sophisticated weaponry.

Stingers, recoiless rifles and
diplomatic pressure accom-
plished what outraged ineffectu-
alism could not hope to do when
the Soviets snuffed out Czechos-
lovkia’s Perestroika some twenty
years ago. Obviously, you all for-
got that Bolshevism draws its
sense of legitimacy from its vic-
tory over White forces during the
Russian civil war.

With such an attitude, it is not
surprising that [when] faced with
a determined resistance, the
masters of the Kremlin opted to
fight until they could no longer
sustain their image as ”peace
lovers” in the world's eyes. We
helped to make their Afghan ad-
venture expensive and humiliat-
ing, just like they did to us in
Vietnam. That is why they want
out.

Let's keep in mind that there
are others who need our help to
resist Cuban and Soviet adven-
turism. We can do no less to help
UNITA and the Nicaraguan
resistance drive the power-
hungry mavens’ of Soviet Imperi-
alism to the negotiating table.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 21, I988

The things he won't miss

This is the last piece of writing

A I will do for this newspaper un-

der the title of editor in chief.
Emotional stuff, isn't it?

Not really. However, I can't say
this will be my last piece of writ-
ing for the newspaper.

Too many 1:30 a.m. produc-
tion nights at the paper have
made my academic transcript
barren.

' So now is probably the best

time to formally announce my in-
tentions to forgo the cold, cruel
real world (as if I haven't seen
enough of it already) for another
year at Pitt, in hopes of complet-
ing my academic workload by
next April. Cross my fingers.

Now that you've all breathed a
sigh of relief, we can only hope
that Jerome Lane decides to stay
also, albeit hopefully, for some
different reasons.

I must admit that since the be-
ginning of this school year, I've
wondered every day how I would
feel on April 20. I envisioned my
last production night as being a
very touching, unforgettable ex-
perience. No way.

I'm all drained out. The com-
bination of my credit load, string-
ing for The Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette and working as
editor-in-chief have burned me
out.

I've been anxious to get out of
here for the past two months. I've
grown a little weary of the day-
to-day operations of the paper. It
just isn't fun for me anymore.

I guess the only way to go‘ out
is on an ambivalent note, be-

cause that's how I feel. Of course,

I realize The Pitt News has done

 

JOHN
ENRIGI-I'I'

a lot for me. When I came here
as a freshman, I was lost. Maybe
I still am, but at least I think I have
a direction. That's the important
distinction.

Here's a list of things that I’|l.be
able to do without next year:

0 The incompetence of the ath-

letic department. For all you im-

pressionable freshmen, believe
me, you could have made a
much better collegiate choice if
sports is your bag.

0 The incompetence of a cer-
tain member of The Pitt News
staff. I just wish this person knew.

0 2:30 a.m. production nights
when you have a 10 o'clock class
in the morning.

0 Press releases.

0 People who have a personal
vendetta with someone and try to
use The Pitt News to their ad-
vantage.

0 Editors who forget we live in
Pittsburgh, and continue to put
Pittsburgh datelines on Pittsburgh
stories. I

0 Missing Import Night at
Peter's because of production.

0 Our Compugraphic com-
puter system.

0 Insolent athletes who won't
be heard from again after they
leave college.

0 Bad columns.

0 The Orientation issue, which
grows frighteningly larger every
yeah

0 Bad writing, in general.

0 People who mumble.

0 Ellen Goodman.

0 People who say things like,
"I can't do that gig. I've already
done my gigs and now I have to
soup my photos.” If you don't
know what I'm talking about, the
above is photography lingo.

0 Doing pays.

0 Bitching at people to turn in
travel and business expense
reports.

0 The noise of the Student Un-
ion elevators.

0 Zippy The Pinhead.

0 Rollie Massimino.

0 Some of thelentertainment
weirdos who've been here.

0 People who don't know how
to use phones.

And now the stuff I'll miss:

0 Road trips.

0 The people I've worked with.

0 My office.

0 Getting sloshed after putting
out a good issue.

0 Theta Nu Gamma.

0 And all the other seemingly
trivial occurrences of the past
three years that I'll look back on
with fondness and nothing but
bittersweet memories. A

0 John Enright was the editor in
chief of The Pitt News.

Last week, I went for a walk
through Panther Hollow at dusk.
It was really wild. Spring is just
about to blow up in our faces,
though the temperatures of late
obscure that.

I used to loathe this city, but
I've finally come to realize how
interesting it actually is.

Pittsburgh is unique in that
there are real, live woods right in

our midst. Last Thursday, the live a

part of "real, live woods"
described the hollow best. I saw
a mallard drake, a wood cock,
and more rats than I could count.
They were almost cute, too. They
were prancing and leaping all
over the place, just being happy
that they're alive on a spring day.

Exactly how I felt. It's hard to
believe that you're in the center
of a major metropolitan area
when you're down in the hollow.
So gang, when finals have made
you a total mess next week, walk
the trails in Schenley Park. There
is nothing more cleansing than
the chance to be alone in the
woods, and the Hollow is a per-
fect place for such activity. Walk-
ing down there by moonlight
isn't the best of times to do it, so
make sure it's daylight; we don't
wanna get nobody kilt.

I went to a party last Saturday
night, and everyone who was
there was from eastern Pa. It
turned out that everyone had
spent his or her "Senior.'Week"
(a strange custom that's very
popular in eastern Pa.) in Wild-
wood, N.J. So, we set out to
recapture the joy of our first week
as "adults."

We played quarters, listened to
Robert Hazard and Meatloaf and
traded stories about midnight
strolls on the beach, trying to get
into "The Penalty Box," having
Greene's Liquor deliver, eluding

the police, debated over which

section of Wildwood is the best
(The Crest, Wildwood proper or
North Wildwood) and we decid-
ed that they're all equally bad,
and that we would probably
never go back.

My point here? Well, it's a blast
to look back, even though I
would never trade where I am
now to return. That's kind of how
I look back on my affiliation with
The Pitt News.

This willbe my final column
ever to grace these pages. I've
been a columnist fortwo years,
and I look back on those years
fondly, but it's time to move on,
time to get a dog.

Someday, I may find myself
working for a newspaper, and if
.‘rI'..~I*. .w?.".*.‘r.‘

ir;\§»:6;+‘;+.'?l "‘..~."}

I do, I'm sure that there will be
other people who worked for col-
lege papers. Perhaps we'll get
together and try to recapture our
experiences as cynical pseudo-
intellectuals. We'll chain-smoke,
drink hard liquor, neglect
hygiene and pontificate, and fi-
nally agree that we don't want to
go back, even though they were
wonderful times.

‘ In the immortal words, of Janis
Joplin, ”Tomorrow never hap-
pens, man. It's all the same [ex-
pletive deleted] day."

Situations change, attitudes
change, but the person under-
neath them remains essentially
unchanged. Common sense, I
know, but it's hard to remember
that when you're young.

In my two years here, I have
gone from being the ultimate
young Republican to a screaming
liberal (well, sort of). I can kid
myself into believing that this

change in my views has some-

how changed the person I am un-
derneath, but all I have to do is
look in my wallet and see that I'm
still a registered Republican.
Maybe someday I'll even start
voting like one.

Don't get me wrong, my views
have changed parts of me, but
when I'm sitting in my bathtub,
all alone, I stilllisten to "The
Sound of Music" soundtrack.

Anyhow, it's been a great two
years. Thanks, and always try to
see things deeply.

The endless cycle
of circular motion

So this is what it all
comes down to, I'm think-
ing to myself. I own at least
one hundred ball-point,
fine—point and felt-tip pens,
and here I am digging
desperately in my coat
pockets (where I've been
known to keep more items
than I do my purse) for one
— just one — and‘ all I can
come up with are two pen-
cils. An ”Office for the
Evaluation of Teaching"
pencil (I know, I know),
and a Pitt Bicentennial pen-
cil that's been whittled

    

  FRANCES
SANSIG

down to "ennial". And
both of them are dun as  
hell.

Lord knows I've put up with more than my fair share of ink

blots and stains, and God, do I ever hate those, and here I am,

sitting in this laundromat, waiting for my sheets to dry, and
listening to an elderly man telling an equally elderly lady how
he spent 18 dollars on groceries at Giant Eagle like it was noth-
ing at all, and all I have to show for those years of irritating ink
spots are these two graphite writing utensils, one earring that
I don't have the match to, and a piece of paper with someone's
phone number on it who I'm sure I'm supposed to remember,
but can't —— and it's all as if it were for nothing at all.

For some reason, I wouldn't have felt so cheated if my pen-
cils were lead. I

I don't have anything to write on but the.magazine I brought,
something I do regularly when I go to the laundromat. But con-
sidering that I don't go very often, I guess it's not such a regular
thing. I wrote in a magazine once before, when I went to visit
my relatives the week before Easter. I took a bus back and be-
came so flooded with thoughts I didn't want to forget, I wrote
them all down in the pages of a Cosmopolitan. No one would
ever believe some of the things that happen to me, I think. But
I'll try to tell them someday anyway.

Like John Enright, I won't be graduating this year. There re-
mains, however, some sweet comfort to be found in the reali-
zation that although I may not have gotten a degree yet, I
certainly got an education.

I very recently wrote a paper on a short story by Edgar Allen
Poe — The Man of the Crowd. The crux of the story is based
on the assumption that man is like a book; however, he is like
a book which cannot be read. No matter how much we ana-
lyze ourselves, we cannot explain ourselves. There's really no
way to sum up an experience or truly explain it in a way that
anyone else could understand. Empathy is only an ‘unfair com-
promise between first—hand experience and man's struggle to
believe, as best he can, that someone else understands it.

I wrote in my paper that existence was like a crime of sorts.
It assaults us with questions, it thieves us of answers — and we
are imprisoned by it until death.

So, as I sit impatiently, waiting for the dryer to cease its
monotonous spinning, I watch my sheets in their circular pur-
suit of dryness. I look for pages with blank spaces in the maga-
zine so I can write more. I can't find any. So I sigh, frustrated
but relieved. I will not have to think anymore.

As I type this into the computer now, I can hear the other ”

editors arguing about whose turn it is to buy the beer. One of
our staff writers,_Jason Hillman, has been reading this as I've

been writing it and telling me that I'm hard to understand. I '

like it that way, I tell him. He says I'm intense. Will Young says
I'm goofy. Everyone's bustling about; it's the last production
night. J

Jon Wells, one of our photographers, is stirring his Slurpee
(he has one almost every night). I ask him what flavor it is. "They
don't come in flavors, they come in colors. It's red."
Marc Duchin is trying to size a photo. Trying is the key word
here. -

John Enright is uptight.

The entertainment people are huddled together. This is their
night. Joel Timulak's brought up some guy with a bandana on
his head. Nobody.asks who_ it is.

Will Young just turned his stereo up. It gets on my nerves. «

He plays it every night. Our desks are right across from each
other. He's always opening the windows. He knows I like it
warm. I shut them. He opens them again. And I shut them again.

Paul Anater, our beloved staff writer, sits -back at his"desk with
his suit and tie attire and his jeans and t-shirt attitude and tells
me he lives his life in the gutter. I know he's only joking.
. The sheets dried. But I take heart in the fact that .there will
always be more dirty laundry that needs to be washed. And
there will always be more stories to be told, and more people
to try to understand, and more books to try to read. And I'll
just have to be satisfied with that. ’

NEW YORK (AP) David Byrne
was in a hotel bathtub in Min-
neapolis when he wrote lyrics for
”No More Flowers” for the Talk-
ing Heads.

This is just one bare fact the

group revealed when talking

about themselves in an interview
to promote their latest LP, Naked!“
Byrne, the group's lead singer
and lyricist, was in Minneapolis
to visit his wife, costume design-

er Adele Lutz, who was doing a

play there.

’’I would work with this
microcassette recorder,” he said.
’’I would have it sitting just out-
side the tub. I would reach out
and speak into it. I'd be singing
in the tub. l’d catch a phrase that
I thought was apropos; I'd put it
on the little recorder.”

The album is on their new‘;

label, Fly Records. It jumped onto
Cashbox magazine's best selling
album chart at No. 20 on April 2.

”This record actually goes back
to our earliest songs and albums,
Remain in Light and Speaking in
Tongues, where we would each
contribute ideas,” said drummer
Chris Franz.

”We rented a rehearsal studio
in New York and each threw out
ideas. We had a little cassette
recorder and had all our instru-
ments there. We’d take an idea,
play it and play it, trading instru-
ments, until it fell apart. Then
we’d strike up a new idea. We
ended up after 10 days with
many snippets of songs.

”We went to Paris into a
recording studio ‘and com-
menced to put them all together
into song form.”

They went to Paris for several
reasons. They laid down tracks
with.Paris-based Third World mu-
sicians who play Caribbean and
Algerian—Moroccan styles. Franz
said they also wanted to hang out
together, which they're more apt
to do in Paris than in New York,
where they have different sets of
friends. ,

”My feeling is that lately, there

has been less openness here,”

said Byrne. ’’I wanted to get away
from that feeling. There is that
kind of vibe here that whatever
is Top 10 in the United States is
all there is. There is a lot going
on in other places.”

Byrne, Franz, and Tina Wey—
mouth met at the Rhode island
School of Design, and still design
their striking album packages.
They added Jerry Harrison to the
trio and put out their first album
in 1977.

The beat of the city is weaken-

”To get good gigs, we would
have had to play music that was
pretty much a prostitution, an
amalgamation of everything that
was popular at the time,” said

Lee Sharra, lead guitarist for the
now defunct North By North-
west. Sharra also feels that this is
one reason for the band's
breakup. V

to get people to come out and do
anything,” said Ron Esser, gener-
al manager of Graffiti, adding, ”A
show in Los Angeles that draws
2,000 people might draw 150 in
Pittsburgh.

Esser said the main problem is,

”There’s only a few places to play ‘

and a whole lot of bands.”
Kurt Voss, production manager
for DiCesare—Engler, explains
that, ”The audience here is not
receptive to new music that is
known by word of mouth, and

own, loca

this lack of interest leads to a lack
of outlets for the people who do
listen.”

Voss feels, however, that ”the
city's atmosphere is slowly
changing from a working class to
a corporate executive town and
the interest in progressive local
music is benefiting from this
change/’

Esser agrees, adding, "Every-
thing changes with time, but
there will always be that small
market. But increasing commer-
cial air time may help.”

WPTS and WRCT were the
only stations in the area to play
local bands’ music, but now
commercial stations wuch as
WXXP and WMYG are realizing
the potential audience for local
talent.

”There’s a new generation
growing up listening to these
bands. But this movement in rock
is different. There wasn't a Wood-

l music cries to su

stock in new wave, and if it
doesn't capture the youth, it's just
another form of music,” said Brad
Freeman, founder and director of
the college radio network, adding
that "youth rebellion and com-
mercial exploitation are the two
main things.”

However, Sharra said many
kids live in the suburbs and have
a hard time getting into the city
to hear the music and an even
harder time finding an ’/under
21" show when they do.

But Esser feels that if you look
for good music, you'll find it
here, no matter what age you are.
Graffiti frequently offers an ”un—
der 21" show preceeding its
”over 21" show, which usually
starts at 10 p.m.

Esser also said, ”A lot of peo-
ple are seeking a thrill through
music and associate good times
with the Pop 40 and, therefore,
are not willing to explore a new

rvive

Sharra said North by North-
west’s problems were mainly
caused by a lack of places to play
and the money that the places
paid. He said, ”When it quit be-
ing fun, it wasn't worth the
effort.”

"There's not much of a music
scene here apart from the cover
bands or bluesy-bar sound that
Norm Nardini or the Iron City
Houserockers played. No ‘ one
takes Pittsburgh seriously for
other types of music,” said John
Young, guitarist for Fusebox and
formerly of North by Northwest.

Steve Morrison, lead guitarist
for Fusebox and formerly of The
Affordable Floors, said he felt that
quitting the Floors was ”a very
logical and natural thing to do”
when it became more work than
fun, adding that, ”After a certain
point, ldidn’t believe in the style

Zapple Entertainment fails to award prize

By Joan Kane

_ Staff Writer

11th Hour, winner of Zapple
Entertainment's 1987 Tri—State
Rock Competition, has yet to
receive the prize it won almost a
year ago.

The prize, as stated on the flyer
advertising the competition, was
the ”recording, pressing and dis-
trubition of at least 1,000 EPs or
if Zapple and A.W.O.L. Records
chooses, 1,000 LPs.” '

’’I’m offering them the EPs,

”said John Antimary, president of

Zapple Entertainment, ”but they
won't accept it.”

The dispute is based on the be-
leif by 11th Hour's bass player,
Rod Schwartz, and manager

a Michael Whited, that Antimary

promised the latter -— the 1,000
LPs.
Antimary said that he did

promise the LPs, but only if the '

band submitted a demo tape so

. he could decide if they had

enough new material.

”Right after we won the com—
petition he asked for a demo
tape, ” said Schwartz, ”but then,
after he saw a couple of our live
shows, he said that he knew we
had a lot of good, strong materi-
al and we would do an album.
We had an oral agreement.”

After 1 1th Hour won the com—

petition, Antimary began setting
up and promoting shows for the
band. 11th Hour continued to
work with Antimary until
October.

”During all that time we
worked with him, after he had
heard and seen the new materi-
al, all we ever talked about was
an LP. He even began mention-
ing album titles,” Schwartz said.

Schwartz’s statement was sup-
ported by an article in the August
26‘September 1, 1987 issue of In
Pittsburgh, in which reporter
Scott Mervis wrote, "1 1th Hour,
a guitar band, is the winner of the
1987 Tri—State Rock Competition.
The prize is a single release, but
John Antimary of Zapple Enter-
tainment says the dance materi-
al, like the '86 winners The
Affordable Floors, is strong
enough to make a full LP.”

Originally, Antimary claimed
to have been misquoted and that
In Pittsburgh neglected to print a
retraction. Later in the interview,
he did not deny the statement
and said that the final decision on
whether to release an EP or LP
was up to A.W.O.L. Records and
not just Zapple Entertainment.

Zapple Entertainment's execu-
tives are John Antimary and Mar-
sha Little. In the March 7, 1987
issue of Billboard magazine it
states that A.W.O.L. Records’ ex-

Warner, who also worked at Zap-
ple, has since left both com-
panies.

”Last January, when we started
talking about recording our al-

bum, John said it would be an EP ,

since we didn't give him a demo.
Then he said if we did give him
a demo and did an LP, he was go-
ing to be tough with us. — he
wanted 100 percent of the profits.
We were promised fifty percent
orginally, just like The Affordable
Floors were promised,” said
Schwartz.

Antimary said that the Afforda-
ble Floors received an LP in lieu
of their prize, which was an EP.
When asked why they were not
just given an LP in the first place,
Antimary replied that it was
A.W.O.L. Records’ decision.

Shawn Harrison, singer and
guitarist for 11th Hour, said that
all of the trouble with Zapple En-
tertainment began when they
stopped doing live shows with
Antimary.

Antimary said that he stopped
working with 11th Hour because
they were losing money. ”They
weren't filling the venues, " he
said.

Schwartz said it was possible
that they hadn't drawn the crowd
sizes that Antimary wanted *0

see, but that it wasn't the band's
fault, but rather, the promoter’s.

”He’d do one of his bang up
promotion jobs,” Whited said.
”He’d hang up a few flyers and
that would be it. To get a good
size crowd, you've got to invest
money in the flyers, posters and

‘radio advertising. We did gather -

a larger following when we did
our own promotion."

The quality of the promotional
work was not the reason for the
split with Antimary. According to
Harrison, the band stopped using
him as a promoter or booking
agent because of a discrepancy
with the booking of a show at In-
diana University of Pennsylvania.

Nancy Costa, the l.U.P.
representative in charge of book-
ing the show, orginally wanted
The Affordable Floors, 1 1th Hour
and The Clarks, Schwartz ex-
plained. When she approached
Antimary, he told her that The
Clarks would be busy recording
an album and were unavailable
for the show, Schwartz said. An-
timary then talked to Costa about
booking another band, S.D.l

she didn't want them and she told
me that she did, but that An-
timary had told her that they were
busy, ”whited said.

No contracts between l.U.P.
and Zapple were ever signed. In-
stead, The Affordable Floors, 1 1th
Hour and The Clarks booked the
show themselves. They signed a
written contract and received
$1,200 to be split among the
bands.

Antimary claimed that he first
mentioned The Clarks to Costa,
but she told him that she had al-
ready tried to book them and they
were unavailable.

Rob Hertweck, guitarist for The
Clarks, said that neither Costa nor
Zapple had approached the band
about the show and that they
were not busy in the studio at that
time. —
Costa stated that she had COH-
tacted Antimary in hopes of
booking The CJafl(S specifically.
"john Apmnary said that The
Clarke would be in the studio and
were unavailable. I had no reason
to not believe him at the time.”

Even though The Affordable
Floors did not use Antimary as a
booking agent or promoter for
that show, Antimary took about
$140 from The Affordable Floors’
album profits. Antimary has con-
trol of The Sounding, The Afford-
able Floors’ album, and on an
itemized statement given to the

band, he deducted his commis- »

sion, approximately 12 percent of
the $1,200, for the l.U.P. show.
Antimary said that Marsha Lit-
tle and The Affordable Floors’
keyboardist, Kirk Botula, had
agreed upon that arrangement.
Botula stated that no such
agreement had ever been made.
In light of the situation, Harri-
son began to have second
thoughts about working with
Zapple Entertainment. ”| ex-
pressed my concern to John
Hayes [Pennsylvania Musician
writer] and he warned me not to
go against Antimary. He said that
we were going to get an LP, but
if we went against Antimary and
made him angry, he'd make it an
EP,” Harrison said.
11th Hour and Antimary at-
tended a meeting at Graffiti,
where the competition is held
each year. Tony DiNardo, own-
er of Graffiti, acted as an unoffi-
cial arbitrator. No settlement was
ever reached.
11th Hour said it would agree
to $1,200, the approximate cost
of pressing 1,000 pieces of 12"
vinyl. Antimary refused, stating
that if Zapple and A.W.O.L. were
to give a prize, their name must
be on the product. Antimary did
not want to give 11th Hour the
money to record an album
elsewhere.
in order to get 11th Hour to
either pick up the prize or official-
ly forfeit any claims to it, An-
timary sent the band a registered
letter.

The letter was incorrectly dat-
ed ”1987” instead of ”1988",a
band member's name was
spelled incorrectly and the drum-
mer’s name did not appear on it
all.

”We feel that if John is going
to bother to send -us a legal docu-
ment, at least it could be error
free," Whited said.

Whited stated that the band
was thinking about recording the
EP.

”Maybe we'll do an Afro-
rhythm-polka record," he added.

Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK — Andy Warhol's
huge and varied personal collec-
tion goes on sale this week, offer-
ing a chance to view — and buy
-—- the paintings and pottery
owned by the man who brought
Campbell's Soup to fine art.

Some say this sale provides a
prime opportunity to learn what
made the artist tick. If so, the les-
son won't be easy.

Confronted with the 10,000
items on the block, ranging from
Navajo blankets to Edgar Degas
sculpture to 134 cookie jars to a
Rolls Royce to a Superman touch-
tone telephone, a student of the
world according to Warhol could
be forgiven for resorting to Cliff's
Notes.

Warhol ”went shopping six
days a week, bless his heart,”
said John L. Marion, chairman of
Sotheby’s North America and its
chief auctioneer. .

”He was interested in form,
and shape, and various things
that fascinated him,” Marion
said. ”And, apparently, it fasci-
nated him more to search out and
acquire than it did ever to
admire.” E

Warhol, who died at 58 in
February of 1987, was not known
as a spendthrift. So there must
have been some method that led
him to accumulate thousands of
objects from a Federal four-poster
bed to a cache of Bakelite bau-
bles, and to hoard silver and plas-
tic in equal measure.

Marion knew Warhol for 25
years, yet he had no idea the ar-
tist had amassed such an impres-
sive collection of American
Classical 19th Century furniture.
Or Art Deco furniture. Or silver
of such quality — the auctioneer
says its like has never appeared
at auction before.

When Marion lifts his gavel on
Saturday, he will open one of
Sotheby’s longest sales ever for a
single collection — 10 days —- in-

volving what the chief auctioneer
termed ”the most diverse and lar-
gest group of things that we have
ever had on consignment.”

The six-volume catalog, com-
piled by an unprecedented 22
departments, is Sotheby’s costli-
est at $95 and its heaviest at 8
pounds

Sotheby’s budgeted at least
$500,000 to promote the Warhol
sale and Marion says, ’’I’m sure
that's been exceeded.” Road
shows exhibited portions of the
collection in eight cities in four
countries; there were exclusive

cocktail parties in Warhol's East

66th Street townhouse.

For the first time in its history,
Sotheby’s will hold a bidding ses-
sion on a Sunday - giving ordi-
nary folks a shot at some of the
more affordable collectibles. The
auction house even printed a
leaflet for neophytes explaining
how to bid. The first day's view-
ing drew 6,000 browsers — three
times the norm.

Officially, the sale is expected
to bring in between $10 million
and $15 million. But Sotheby’s
says the estimates are based sole-
ly on market value without the
”Warhol factor” that could boost
prices into the stratosphere. Pro-
ceeds go to the Andy Warhol
Foundation for the Visual Arts.

This sale offers a bit of Warhol
for just about everyone. The esti-
mates range from $50-$75 for a
”Campbell Kid” soup bowl (in-
scribed ”Andy”) to $350,000-
$450,000 for a Jasper Johns oil
painting titled ”Screen Piece.”

There are works by Warhol
contemporaries, including Johns,
Roy Lichtenstein and Cy Twom-
bly, and others by such artists as
Pierre—Auguste Renoir and Henri
de Toulouse-Lautrec.

There's a 19th Century ”Chip-
pendale Style” pine chest esti-
mated at $300-$400, and a ”Fine
Chippendale Mahogany Camel-
back Sofa" —- expected to fetch
100 times as much.

More than 1,000 pieces of
jewelry are on sale; Warhol col-
lected everything from Bakelite
bracelets to ruby and diamond
earrings.

’’I never saw him wear a single
jewel,” wrote Suzie Frankfurt in
the catalog, ”until one night at
Studio 54. l saw a slight bulge un-
der his Brooks Brothers shirt
which turned out to be a rather
grand emerald necklace, so I sup-
pose he occasionally wore them
in secret. '

There are also more than 300
watches, from Cartier to Popeye.
"During the years that I knew
Andy, he only wore one watch:
a woman's gold mid-seventies
Rolex,” wrote Rupert Smith.

Warhol's outstanding Art Deco
collection includes a spectacular
series of silver tea and coffee serv-
ices. The artist himself reported-
ly preferred to dine on Fiesta
Ware. That, too, is on the block.

Some, like Paige Powell, a
close friend of Warhol and adver-
tising director of Interview maga-
zine, say this diverse and varied
lot offers such a unique insight
into the artist that it shouldn't be
divided. ‘

Warhol was ”by far the most
important artist in the 20th Cen-

tury,” Powell said. ”The impor-

tance of [his collection] will grow
as time goes on.  Even King Tut
is a good parallel.”

Powell wrote to at least 30 art
patrons and other billionaires,
seeking someone to bid for the
entire collection. So far, she's had
no luck.

Marion responds to the idea
with one word: ”nonsense.” He

says there would be no purpose.

in keeping the collection
together, and maintains that
Warhol himself "would have
adored” the auction.

Powell disagrees on that point,
too. '

’’If you knew Andy,” she said,
”you would know that you
wouldn't know what he really
would have wanted.”

_ ”THE MEANING‘ OF GREEK LIFE”

Following the induction of our officers, a conference
of all sorority and fraternity presidents and both
executive boards of IFC and Panhellenic was held
at Hidden Valley. The purpose of the retreat was
training of officers, sharing of information, and
promoting of chapter relations. We re-e valua ted our
goals to establish a direction for the greek system.
Some very interesting issues that were addressed
included: hazing, situational leadership, and crisis
management. Without a doubt, every leader walked
away from the President's Conference with more
confidence and a sense of unity in our greek system.

From the President's Conference, the IFC and
Panhellenic executive boards went on the road to
Hunt Valley, MD as delegates to the Northeast
IFC/Panhellenic Conference. Over 85 schools were
in attendance. Speakers addressed current issues
such as: Legal Liability, Aids Awareness, and
Demythologizing the Animal House Image of
Greeks. The breakout sessions involved everything
from leadership burnout to rush. Our own Polyxena

. Speros (Panhel E. V. P.) was elected President of the

NEPC for 1988-89. Besides all of the knowledge we
brought back from the convention, we carried back
three awards. Panhellenic received awards for Rush
Recruitment and Philanthropy while IFC received
an award for Rush Promotion. The convention
served as a means to expand ourselves and boost
morale for upcoming events.

Back at the local level, Greeks at the University of

' Pittsburgh are on the move in the area of community

service. There are others out there that need our
help and we are here for them. We give our time
and effort in events like the All Greek Philanthropy
and the Hug-a-thon. Our Greek Week this year
raised nearly $90,000 for the Western PA School for
Blind Children. To sacrifice your time for others is
a quality of greek life and every, year greeks work
very hard to leave their mark with the University
of Pittsburgh.

Within our organization, Greeks give credit where
credit is due. As the winter term draws to a close,
each year the lnterfraternity Council and the
Panhellenic Assn. recognize the best in greek life.
Awards are given out in the areas of academics,
alumni programming, chapter service, intramurals,
rush, social programming and fraternity/sorority
education. We also recognize the outstanding
chapters in all areas with the Cathedral Award for
Chapter Excellence. This award reflects overall
excellence of chapter programming. The most
prestigious awards any greek men and women could
possibly receive in their college career at the
University of Pittsburgh are the ‘Louis K. McKlinden

I P and Sa vina S. Skewis awards. These are the highlight
a of the ceremony and represent individuals who gave

their all to academics, fraternity/sorority, greek and
university life.

Our organization is very challenging in respect to
the constant influx of new members each term. This
places a great responsibility on the active members
in the area of pledge education. Greeks care about
Greeks and we are making strides in the areas of
membership education. In the upcoming year, we
will be organizing seminars in the areas of AIDS
prevention and alcohol awareness. These are very

’ important concerns in everyone’s life and we have

committed ourselves to provide education to the
community, university and student groups. With the
cooperation of all the Greeks, our newest members
will be exposed to these important issues which will
result in 100 percent education of a Greek system
in four years. Striving for excellence in every aspect
of Greek life—OUR GOAL’!!!

A PUBLIC RELATIONS UP-DATE

By Marc Troke, II_-'C’s Public Relations Chairman
The lnterfraternity Council's Public Relations committee has recently been
developed into a useful and powerful tool for communication that represents
the Fraternities and as well as providing service projects which allow overall
IFC participation.

My task is to explain to the non-Greeks the aspects of the Fraternal System
at Pitt which are not evident. Actions would convey these aspects better than
words; and in the past year many such actions have occurred and received
an overwhelming response.

The ”First Annual Greek Fund Raiser” was held lanuary 30 through the
combined efforts of the IFC and the Panhellenic Association. This fund raiser
consisted of a 24-hour pool and ping-pong marathon held in the William Pitt
Union Recreation Center. Approximately $3,500 was raised through sponsors’
contributions for the Greek Week Charity. The Greeks interacted with each
other raising money for charity and through television coverage, from KDKA
and WTAE, the philanthropic nature of the Greeks were made evident to the
public. This event will occur in the future annually aiding in the Greek Week
Charity. I

However, we do not stop here. Many Greeks are involved with the student
government, allocations committee, varsity sports, and acting as resident
assistants. Sports also is sponsored by the IFC. This year's winner was Sigma
Alpha Epsilon winning 5 out of the 7 intramural sports.

Awarding the excellence of the fraternities and sororities is another duty
for the IFC. Awards were given in the ca tegories of alumni, pledge education,
social programming, and academics. This year's Cathedral Awards for Chapter
Excellence and Achievement were awarded to Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternities and Kappa Kappa Gamma and Delta Delta Delta sororities.
The outstanding Creek Man and Greek Woman were honored at the IFC
Second Annual Greek Chapter A wards Banquet. Iames Sluck of Pi Kappa Alpha
won the Greek Man of the Year and Noreen Cmar from Kappa Kappa Gamma
won Greek Woman of the Year award. These individual were honored for
their contributions to the Greek System. Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Delta
sororities won the most improved chapter award while Lambda Chi Alpha
won for the fraternities.

The fraternities at Pitt are determined to draw out the shouts of
misjudgements in the fraternity system and replace them with shouts of
philanthropy, athletics, and scholastics. From what I have seen in the last year,
we have only just begun.

A PUBLIC RELATIONS UP-DATE
BY MICHELLE NEILL, PANHELLENIC PUBLIC RELATIONS CHAIRMAN

Throughout the 1987-1988 academic year, the Panhellenic
Association of the University of Pittsburgh, the governing body
of all Pitt sororities, participated in a special conference, a
charity event, and earned an award for community service.

Panhellenic also participated in the Hug-A-Thon raising
over $164.00 for Woman's Place, a shelter for battered
women.

Recently, a philanthropic award was presented to
Panhellenic during Greek Week commending its community
service buy helping the Central Blood Bank and the
Harmarville Rehabilitation Center.

Michele Iedlica, President of Panhellenic, is proud of what
the Panhellenic Association has accomplished this past year
and is looking forward to future events with a positive outlook.

Iedlica said, ”I foresee an increase in growth, community
service, hours and money raised. I think we're getting more
acknowledgement for our achievements by our community
and the university.” '

Although the Pitt Panhellenic plans to sponsor the Area
for Panhellenic Conference, which includes 17 schools from
Pennsylvania, Iedlica said she would rather concentrate on the
various sororities’ internal affairs for the upcoming school year.

”For now I would like to emphasize internal growth in
the various sororities. My personal goals are to see intersorority
relations to come and stay a very intricate part of our
Panhellenic system. I would like to also see part of our
Panhellenic system become more active and responsible in
Pledge programs.” said Iedlica.

The Panhellenic Association plans to better its services and

better its members in order that its associates may gain positive
response from the university community. ‘By making
Panhellenic the best that it can possibly be, we will not only
be benefitting ourselves, but the university also. ” said Iedlica.

It was the Best of Times not the worst of times

‘By Patricia Lomando White
I Staff Writer

How often have people felt that
the world has taken a turn for the
worse and that things aren't as
simple as they used to be? Well,
in Winnie Flynn's latest musical
revue Best of Times, a nostalgic
and humorous look at our past,
present and future, we might just
realize that life doesn’t really
change that much, only its situ-
ations; '

Flynn, who wrote and
produced the show which
opened April 14, has been stag-
ing revues at the Holiday Inn on
McKnight Road in the North Hills
for seven years. She has also
produced musical revues in the
Pittsburgh area for 12 years.

The show opens with Dillon
McCartney strongly singing ”Best
of Times” as the rest of the cast
gradually joins in. It's a nice lead
in for the show’s theme, which is
that things aren’t so bad today, es-
pecially if you look at where
we've been. And amid much lo-
cal humor, the cast not only takes
a look at where we've been, but
also where we might go.

Achtung! It's the Arabs for West Germany 

By Manny Theiner

Staff Writer

The stagnant music of the West
desperately needs some positive
infusion. Line up the rotting
corpses of Western genres and
the futility of reinterpreting
centuries-old classics and recy-
cling time-worn jazz riffs be-
comes painfully clear. Popular
rock music has become a soul-
less corporate ogre, and ex-
perimentalists flounder about,
ever deeper in the mire of the oc-
cult and the destroyed.

It's time for a new spiritual
direction, one which requires us
to look beyond our own narrow,
cultural boundaries to the coun-
tries of the Third World. Reggae

was the first fruit to flow out of
what seems like an endless cor-
nucopia, but sorry, Rasta fans, it's
still only a drop in the bucket of
the sounds sifting slowly into the
mainstream which, for lack of a
better term, are grouped under
the heading ’’world music."
All around the world, new
music is being created by com-
bining different ethnic strains
with the appeal of popular mus-
ic, using the newest instruments
and recording techniques. Span-
ning the miles from Carribean
soca and salsa and African juju
and soukous to Arabic ra’i, Cel-
tic trad—rock and beyond, the
World Beat brings traditional
music to the forefront of the
revival of popular music.

The first appearance of the
World Beat in Pittsburgh, other
than reggae of course, will be a
German group called Dissiden-
ten, whose second album Sahara
Elektrik, on Shanachie Records, is
a big hit on local radio stations
WYEP and WRCT. What makes
Dissidenten different from the
average Berlin rock group is that
they sing in Arabic and their com-
positions are based on Moroccan
tribal music.

What are Arabs doing in West
Berlin? Well, one out of five Ber-
liners is non-German, and the
other reason lies in the mass
migration of North African
Gastarbeiter (guest workers) to
Germany over the past twenty
years. inevitably, the musical tra-
ditions of Mideast and West have
enmeshed, creating a hybrid
”ethnopop” in the same way that
black African slaves originated
the blues in America.

The fact that the Arabic pop is
upbeat and danceable is some-

what misleading. Underneath the
swaying, chantlike melodies, the
lyrics of Dissidenten are similar

to those in blues or reggae -— they .

emphasize the problems of social
and economic oppression in
North Africa.

The song ”Sahara Elektrik” re-
lates to the situation of of modern
Arab youth: *

They want to educate you/but

lead you into the trap/they intend ,

to uproot you/so fight against
those who pretend to be friends
in East and West.

The musicians of the North
African group Lem Chaheb assist
in the production of Sahara Elek-
trik. Their frontman, Cherif Lam-
ram, is also a poet of the new
youth movement and his lyrics
appear on grafittied walls in
North African universities. He
compares his generation of Arab
youth to mice in a laboratory —
the United States, Europe and
USSR conduct tests to discover
what makes the Arabs tick.

The proliferation of World Beat

emergence of Third World coun-
tries as influential in the ”big pic-
ture.” Arabic Fadela and Israel's
Ofra Haza, and the darker-tinged
outfits such as C Cat Trance,
Minimal Compact, and Aksak
Maboul readily integrate Arabic
modal scales and rhythms.

American groups like Saqqar_a
Dogs and Savage Republic (who I
recently played here) have in-
dependently evolved a similar
sound.

A night spent with Dissidenten
will offer a glimpse of the direc-
tion of popular music — only the
relative isolationism of North
America will keep us segregated
for a while from this worldwide
movement. A song that sounds
mysterious and exotic now may
just be commonplace for a future

Set against the plush surroundings of an exclusive
health resort, Casual Sex? revolves around the
lifelong friendship of Stacy and Melissa, two,very
contemporary women who are suddenly forced to
confront the ever—changing social and sexual atti-
tudes of the ’80’s.

Casual Sex? had its genesis as a three—song skit first
performed at the Groundlings, a West Coast reflec-
tion of Chicago's famed Second City. Written by two
aspiring young writer/comediennes, Judy Toll and
Wendy Goldman, it later evolved into a full—blown
play which ran for one year at the Groundlings
Theatre with Toll and Goldman playing Melissa and
Stacy.

Goldman, who appeared in a small role in Ivan
Reitman’s Ghostbusters, caught the filmmaker’s at-
tention when her name appeared in a trade paper
review of Casual Sex. He and his wife Genevieve
Robert were both impressed with the production
when they saw it, and Robert, who had just recent-
ly directed an award winning short film, A Little Vic-
tory, wanted to direct it as her first feature-length
motion picture.

Cast in the film version of Casual Sex? are Lea
Thompson and Victoria Jackson. The storyline fol-
lows the two women to a swankhealth resortwhere
they encounter several men who cause them bewil-
derment about modern dating and romance. The

Art

Continued from page 16.

Unlike other forms of printmak-
ing, which permit many impres-
sions to be made of one plate, the
monotype process yields only
three copies, or ”pu|ls.” Each
pull is different and fainter than
the previous impression, resulting
in images which are soft and
diffuse.

Predergrast’s monotype prints

are one of the largest bodies of
work ever produced in this
medium.

The artist was born in New-
foundland in 1859 and raised in
Boston, where he spent a large
portion of his adult life. Long‘
recognized for his oil and water-
color paintings, Predergrast made
his first monotype in 1891 and,
over a period of 10 years, creat-

ed about 200 works.

”Monotypes by Maurice
Predergrast” was organized by
the Terra Museum of Art, Evan-
ston and Chicago, ill. The nation-
al tour of the exhibition opened
at the National Gallery of Art,
Washington, D.C., in 1986.

more acoustic aspect of Bauhaus,
and features Daniel Ash on vo-
cals as well as guitar.

Ash and Haskins proceeded to
kick the bass player out of Tones
on Tail due to alleged drug
problems and personality clash-
es. Meanwhile, David J., after
playing on Bloody Nonsense
with the Jazz Butcher, rejoined
Ash and Haskins to form Love
and Rockets -- named after a

California-based comic book — -

in early 1985.

Ash stated that the name
seemed particularly relevant to
the most important thoughts on
the superficial minds of the
masses.

Later in 1985, Love and Rock-
ets released their first LP, entitled
Seventh Dream of Teenage
Heaven. The album is stylistical-
ly similar to the Tones on Tail LP,
yet is more cohesive and melod-
ic, similar to the Tones on Tail
songs ”Rain” and ”Christian
Says.” Songs like ”Haunted
When the Minutes Drag” and the
title track were the vein that Love
and Rockets were to find and ex-
pand upon in their next release.

Express, the 1986 album,
showed several sides of the band,
from the very electric "It Could
Be Sunshine” and ”Life in Lara-
lay” to the brilliant acoustic
pieces, ’’All In My Mind” and
”Love Me.” The band had indeed
grown and expanded, and main-
taining two lyricists/vocalists in
Daniel Ash and David J. provid-
ed for the depth in the band’s
material.

Love and Rockets latest release,
Earth.5un.Moon., hit the record
stores in October of 1987. It
holds nearly the same style as Ex-
press but offers various subtle
musical diversions. Side two is an
all-acoustic adventure, which
does indeed bear resemblance to
Pink Floyd in a good way.

This resemblance is especially
notable on ”Waiting For the
Flood,” ”The Telephone is Emp-
ty” and ”Youth.” The band also
mimics Marc Bolan to a great ex-
tent on the Daniel Ash composi-
tion of the T—Rexish ”Lazy.” The
album's heavy song is ”Mirror
People,” where Daniel Ash
wails: I wish I could be nothing
at all. While the album's fluffiest
track is the bumblbeeish pop of
”Welcome Tomorrow,” with the
lyrics ”by accident.”

Overall, the album is a progres-
sion for Love and. Rockets. Yet,
this progression is very subtle and
maintains the dynamic at-
mosphere and excellent musi-
cianship of. the band's past
albums.

Love and Rockets will be play-
ing live at the Syria Mosque on
Tuesday, April 26th at 7:30 p.m.
They will be dragging along with
them Echo and the Bunnymen

0 Spring football is in the air,
and every team — from mighty
Miami on down to Kansas State

pr is a national champion in the
spring. Prior to the 1987 season,
Pitt placekicker/guru Jeff Van-
Horne predicted the Panthers
would have an eight—win cam-
paign. Pitt, of course, won eight
games. So how many wins does
Van Horne forecast for 1988? ”At
least 10.”

0 In a recent Pitt News story,
Panther defensive lineman Marc
Spindler stated that one of his
goals in 1988 is to make the pres-
tigious All-East team. All-East
team? Whatever.

I would not be surprised, come

the end of next season, to find
Spind|er’s name somewhere on
the All-America team.

0 1988 might be the best
chance in years for two teams
from the same metropolitan area
to be in the World Series, and I'm

not talking about the Cubs and

the White Sox. There is no doubt
that New York's Yankees and
Mets and the San Francisco Bay

9 area's Giants and A's have the

firepower to go all the way.

Spring of hard work
gives Allen place on
Panther defensive line

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

If redshirt freshman Richard Al-
Ien continues playing as well as
he has this spring, he is assured
a starting position on the Panther
defense this fall.

With Jon Carter graduating and
Tony Siragusa out for the season
with a knee injury, Allen is ex-
pected to help fill the void in the
defensive line.

’’I don't think there is any ques-
tion that he will start with the loss
of Carter and Siragusa," said Pitt
coach Mike Gottfried.

Allen, although confident of
starting, knows that plenty of hard
work lies ahead. ”I feel I have a
good shot as long as I work hard
and concentrate on my assign-
ments. So far, my practices have
been going well," he com-
mented. *

This past season as a freshman,
Allen played in two games for the
Panthers before breaking his
hand, which enabled him to take
an injury redshirt. He was able to
use the time to his advantage.

’’It was a learning experience.
I was able to watch and learn as-
signments,” Allen noted.

While Gottfried will undoubt-
ably miss the experience that
could be provided by the injured
Siragusa, he is comfortable with
Allen on his defensive line.

”Richard is younger and less
experienced than Siragusa. He is

Footbal

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

When Pitt went into spring
football practice, there were a lot
of holes to fill. Now, five weeks
later, everything is starting to
come together.

”We are looking better,” Pitt
coach Mike Gottfried said. "We
have been a little banged up, but
everybody is doing gppd._'’ '

Sophomore Lariywanke has

going to have to learn to do the
things Siragusa has with his ex-
perience," said Gottfried.

However, Gottfried noted that
Allen has all the tools to perform
at a high level. ”He is very quick
off the ball and very strong. I
think he will be very capable in
the fall," observed the coach.

Allen was a three-year letter-
man in football at Benedictine
High School in Cleveland, Ohio.
As a senior tri-captain, he led the
team in tackles (130) while earn-
ing second team All-City honors.

During his senior year, Allen
was hotly pursued by recruiters
from North Carolina State, Michi-
gan State and Kentucky, as well
as Pitt. The Panthers were able to
secure the services of the stan-
dout lineman.

’’I liked the defensive tradition
at Pitt and I was very impressed
with coach Gottfried when he
came to my home,” recounted
the marketing major when asked
why he chose Pitt.

Allen hasla good working rela-
tionship with Pitt defensive line
coach Frank D’Alonzo. ”He is a
very good coach. We have a
friend relationship off the field.
On the field he is my coach and
I have learned a lot from him,”
said Allen.

This coming season, Allen will
have on-the-job training in the art
of playing defensive line at the
University of Pittsburgh. By all in-
dications, the Panthers are ex-
pecting him to succeed.

VINCE LONGO

State, West Virginia, Boston Col-
lege, and Notre Dame. They
might have opened the season
with a record of 3-2. Still, that is
no excuse for scheduling a home
game against a team such as
Northern Iowa.

At places such as LSU, where
every game is sold out no matter
who the opponent is, scheduling
Northern Iowa would be OK. But
Pitt, although exceptionally well-
supported for a school in a major
city, does not have the drawing

power to get a good crowd for
that game. Unless there is an ex-
plosion of interest in Pitt football
in the next few months, the ath-
letic department will probably be
tickled if 40,000 drop by.

0 For those of you who 
tired of the steady diet of Navy,
Temple, and Rutgers and eager
for a Pitt football schedule more
national in scope, Pitt hooks up
with Miami in 1989 and 1990,
Oklahoma in 1990, Ohio State in
1988, 91, 92, and 93, North
Carolina in 1991 and 92, Min-
nesota in 1991 and 92, and (yes!)
the University of the Pacific in
1989.

Redshirt freshman Richard Allen should see plenty of playing time next season.

team starting to come together

had the most time at quarterback
because of Darnell Dickerson’s
injury and seems to be respond-
ing to the call.

”Larry has been coming on
strong," Gottfried said. ”He
seems to be getting a hold on the
offense and seems to be working
hard. It doesn't help us any that
Dickerson is out. But the offense
looks strong.”

_ The offensive line returns most
of last season's starters, so there

was no real need in any of those
positions.

A running back, on the other
hand, will have to fill the void left
by Craig Heyward. The principle
character in that will be Brian Da-
vis — coming back after a two-
year hiatus.

"Brian has shown us some
good things during the spring,”
Gottfried said. ”He has missed a
lot of time dug to classes, but

when the season’r‘oll»s"arotlnd,” he "

should be ready to go.”

On the field, the offense seems
to be coming together according
to defensive end Burt Grossman.

”They are missing a few key
players with Darnell and Davis
missing practices, but they still
look ready. Teams aren't sup-
posed to be at 100 percent dur-
ing the spring, so I'd say they look
as good as can be expected.”

The defense had ‘more _h_o_|e§ toy

”We have had a few guys with
big springs,” defensive coordina-
torjohn Fox said. ”Louis Riddick
has been coming on strong at free
safety. Richard Allen looks good
on the line. I think we have come
a long way during the spring.”
The linebacker position is still
the biggest question mark for the
defensive squad.

get until the season begins,” Fox
said. ”We have some quality
freshmen coming in and they will
be expected to contribute.
”How much they play might
be a different thing. You hear
about how good players are, but
you really don't know how good
until you get them in your sys-
tem. I expect them to do good,
but you just never know.”
iox went on to say that the
anthers will use the same defen-
sive scheme used last season, but
the team will be a lot younger
and more unpredictable.
’’I’m not expecting the defense
to be as dominant as last season,”

Fox said, ”but they will keep us
in games.”

One of the standout players on
the defensive side this spring has
been Grossman.

”Burt has had a very good
spring,” Gottfried said. ”It may
be his best spring since I have
been here. We expect him to do
good things for us once the sea-
son starts.

"I think we are coming
together as a team,” Grossman
said. ”We are starting to do the
little things right. The defense is
just about ready to go. I guess
we’ll find out how good we real-
ly are when the fall comes
around.”

Orioles have a lot of ‘company
when it comes to losing streak

By Hal Bock

AP Sports Writer

As Baltimore's grounded Ori-
oles reached for the record, it
seemed appropriate to examine
more closely the 1904 Washing-
ton Senators, the‘ first major
league team to start a season with
13 straight losses.

The Senators had trouble be-
fore the first pitch that season.
Ownership and managerial
difficulties deprived the team of
a complete spring training, a con-
dition this group could hardly af-
ford. Eventually, the club settled
on catcher Malachi Kittredge to
fill out the daily lineup card. This,
apparently, was not a terribly
good idea.

Kittredge had been around. A
veteran of 13 seasons, he came

to the Senators the year before
from the quaintly named Boston
Beaneaters. That Washington
team finished last with a 43-94
record and manager Tom Loftus
was not invited back.

The 1904 Senators opened at
home with a loss against Philadel-
phia, then tied the next game
against the Athletics, 6-6. It was
a momentary respite from the bad
times that awaited them. There
was a 12-2 loss against Philadel-
phia, then three straight losses at
Boston, three losses at home
against New York and two more
against Boston. o

By then, the losing streak — in-
cluding three shutouts in four
games — had reached major
league proportions. It was clear
to all observers that this was a
bad baseball team and so it was

with some trepidation that the Se-
nators traveled to New York for
a four-game series.

Washington last the first three
but then ended the string at 13
losses with a 9-4 victory over the
Highlanders. As you might ex-
pect, the milestone victory was
accomplished with help. New
York committed eight errors.
Washington's heroes with two
hits apiece were infielders
Charlie Moran and Joe Cassidy,
outfielders Jack Thoney and Kip
Selbach, and catcher Lew Drill,
who was playing because Kit-
tredge had taken the day off to
concentrate on managing.

Beating the Highlanders did
not take the heat off for the
manager. When the Senators
dropped their next three games at

Bianco gives extra time to kids

By Sharon Haney

Staff Writer

When Pitt baseball player Matt
Bianco was just learning to swing
a bat, he had plenty of role
models. Three of his older
brothers —- Mike, Val and Marc
—— all played at Pitt under current
head coach Bobby Lewis.

After watching endless innings
of baseball at Trees Field, Bian-
co, from Carrick, Pa., decided to
follow in his brothers’ footsteps.

Now it's Bianco’s turn to in-

fluence youngsters. Bianco, a
sophomore, doesn't limit his
knowledge to the classroom or
the playing fields. On Fridays, he
participates in a student observa-
tion by teaching physical educa-
tion (his major) to two second-
grade classes and two fifth-grade
classes. Bianco said/’I wanted to
coach. Teaching phys. ed. is like
coaching. I love it. I have a lot of

‘fun. I like to make them laugh; it

keeps them interested."
Coach Lewis feels, ”Matt will

be a good coach and teacher. He
likes kids.”
This season, Bianco started off

with a bang. He belted his first ,

college home run in his first-at-
bat. '

But Bianco isn't concerned
with having.a high batting aver-
age. ’’I’m not worried about my
average,” he said. ”I just want to
hit when the team needs a hit.”
So far, it seems to be working

since Bianco is hitting .259.

Pat Cupid has been a consistent runner for the track team.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 21, l988

Cupid doing different type of

flying for Panther track team

By Debbi Edwards

For The Pitt News

Five years ago, Pat Cupid, then
a junior at Wingate Senior High
School, enrolled in an aviation
class because of her fascination
with the idea of flight.

Her enthusiasm fueled her
quest for knowledge and, within
a year's time, the teenager found
herself piloting an plane through
the happy blue sky.

”|’ve found that you have to
reach really high in life. You have
to reach for the stars,” Cupid ex-
plained. ’’It’s only then when you
fall the clouds will be there to
catch you.” .

Today, Cupid is still racing the
wind. As a member of the wom-
en's track team at Pitt, she takes
an on-foot approach toward mov-

ing swiftly.

”Pat is the most competitive
and consistent sprinter at Pitt,”
said Coach Steve Lewis. ”She is
dependable for a top perfor»
mance at all times.”

Cupid is an important link in
the new success and competitive-
ness found on the Lady Panther
track team. In the past year, she
has been a part of shattering four
school records, each as a mem-
ber of a relay team.

”A major inspiration for me has
been the support of our freshmen
— Clarissa Dudley, Keisha De-
mas, Michelle Morgan and Alexis
Archer,” Cupid said. ”They are
really here to do their best for the
team and that's whatwe need —
that's what will help us win a
championship.”

Team glories aren't often

it

thought of as something to work
for. After all, track is an individu-

. alistic sport. Team results have no

effect on someone qualifying for
nationals or even for the
Olympics.

Cupid, however, keeps alive
the dream of winning a Big East
championship.

”Our team is good enough thiég
year to win a Big East title. We
have the desire and the talent to
be recognized as a team to be
reckoned with,” said Cupid.

”We also need to win just to be
recognized on campus. It would
make a tremendous statement for
women's sports at Pitt. We need
to be acknowledged as doing the
work just like the men — even if
we have to be conference
champs first,” she added.

It takes hard work and dedica-
tion to compete all year long as

track members often do. They“?

compete in both an indoor and
outdoor season. The women's
team has shattered 17 school
records during the 1987 indoor
efforts alone.

Cupid names Lewis for having
a lot to do with her winning per-
formances on the track.

”He won’t let me short change
myself. He knows the ability I
have and where l’d like to go,”
said Cupid. ”Coach Lewis
respects his athletes and we
return his respect. That's what
makes him a good coach.”

Athlete and coach seem to
know where the other is coming
from, and in more ways than one.
Cupid and Lewis attended the
same high school in New York.
They also had the same track
coach, Saul Lerner.

Cupid has definitely come a
long way since her high school
days. The positive attitude she
projects has been an inspiration
during practice and at meets.

"Pat is a leader,” said Lewis.
”She is an athlete who leads by
example.”

Track has given Cupid more
than wins or losses. It's given her
a chance to develop and mature
as a person.

”The one thing I will always
have is my will to do the best,”
Cupid explained. ’’I have be-
come disciplined to put in the
time for something I really want
and be patient enough to wait for
the results.”

Bianco would like to improve

his play by strengthening his
defense. Bianco’s position in the
outfield is a relatively new one.
’’I never played in the outfield un-
til last year. I’m not used to it. I
think if I was a better defensive
player, I would be a complete
player,” he said.
&"Matt is a very versatile athlete
who can play at different posi-
tions. Plus, he’s a good hitter.
He's looking better swinging the
bat all the time,” said Lewis.

Time is something Bianco has
learned to manage. Balancing
academics and athletics isn’t a
problem for him.

”lt’s not as tough as people say.
The biggest problem is organiz-
ing time. But this term I'm doing

‘ 

I'm not worried about
my average. I just want
to hit when the team
needs a hit.

—-Matt Bianco

that better.”

One thing that could be better
is the Panthers’ record. Bianco
said, ”We always do better in the
later innings. We usually end on
a good note. We need to do that
earlier. Plus, we need to keep
playing aggressively after we
have a lead.”

Bianco is enjoying himselfthis
year, though. He said,”These are
times that l’|l always remember
because I'm having a lot of fun.”

Baseball isn't the only sport
which Bianco enjoys. While in
high school, Bianco won the city
championship in golf. This sum-
mer, he plans to take up his clubs
again. Plus, he plans to work for
his brother's construction
company.

One idea that works for him is
the philosophy of Boston's Wade
Boggs. ”He has super discipline.
if you construct your life the way
he does, baseba|l—wise, I can't see
how you could fail,” Bianco said.

It's likely that Bianco will find
the success he's looking for.

Philadelphia, Kittredge was told
to worry only about catching for
the rest of the season. The new
skipper would be right fielder Pat-
sy Donovan, an old hand at this
managing business. His creden-
tials included an eighth-place fin-
ish with St. Louis in the National
League the year before, perfect
for this crew.

another chance. He finished his
managing career with that 1-16
log, an .059 percentage.

The 1904 Senators batted .227
but were worse than that in the
field, committing 314 errors. First
baseman Jake Stahl led the league
with 29 misplays, a feat that so
impressed ownership it made
him manager of the team the next
year.
