angers

Jewish

students

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

For some Jewish students
graduating from Pitt in April,
reports that the university has
changed the graduation date from
Sunday, April 29, to Saturday,
April 28, present more than a
little inconvenience.

“We [Were] relieved about a
year ago when we heard that
graduation was going to be held
on a Sunday since we were
worried about a conﬂict with the
Sabbath. Then at the end of the
term we started hearing rumors
about the change. After the break

' I called Thackeray Hall and they
confirmed that it was now set for
Saturday,” said Leon Morris,
senior religious studies major.

Morris said that a public event
like graduation is not in
conjunction with the spirit of the
Sabbath.

“Activities on the Sabbath for
allJews are supposed to be restful
and family-oriented and a civic
function does not fall under those
grounds,” Morris said.

Morris said that the change
would affect Jews in a variety of
ways.

“For OrthodoxJews it will mean
not being able to attend because
they can’t ride in a car on the
Sabbath. For Reform Jews there
is no problem like that but simply
a religious conﬂict with the spirit
of the day," Morris said.

Nancy White, assistant to Pitt
president Wesley Posvar, said
that university officials would
like to keep the initial date, but
Civic Arena officials want to use
the building for another purpose
that day.

“We are still trying to negotiate
with the Civic Arena but it looks
like the hockey playoffs that are
scheduled for Sunday will force
us to have graduation on
Saturday,” said White. “Right now
we are trying to convince them
that we can proceed with
graduation on the 29th and be
out of there on time for them to
still have the playoffs."

Morris said thathe doesn’t think
the university explored all other
possible options before opting
for the change to Saturday.

“I spoke to an assistant in the
president’s office and I
understand that they are in a
tough bind but I think they were

ii too quick to make their decision.

Du/ee editor wins awardfor battling censorship

By Christopher McCall
For The Pitt News

Sean McNamara, the former
news editor of the student paper
at Duquesne University, has been
awarded the 1989 Scholastic Press
Freedom Award for ﬁghting the
attempted censorship of his paper
by Duquesne’s student
government.

The award, sponsored by the
Student Press Law Center and the
National Scholastic Association/
Associated Collegiate Press, is
given each year to a student who
shows outstanding support for
the free-press rights of students.

McNamara and the rest of the
staff of TheDuquesneDuke, their
student paper, found that the
Catholic university’s student
government closed its office on
Tuesday morning, Feb. 14, 1989.

Harold “Happy” Meltzer, the
SGA president, locked the staff
out of its office because of a birth
control ad published in an earlier
issue, saying that it was “in no

way consistent with the mission
statement of the university and
the values and traditions upon
which Duquesne University was
founded and operates.”

The office was reopened, but
he warned The Duke staff not to
run the ad again.

The staff republished the ad,
but this time with a disclaimer
stating, “this ad does not
necessarily reﬂect the views or
values of Duquesne University."

The student government then
silenced the paper by suspending
editor-in—chief Rebecca Drumm
and changing the locks on the
doors.

McNamara and TheDuleestaff
published and distributed a four-
page paper to tell students that
The Duke had been shut down
because they refused to be
censored. _

McNamara, in seeking to
expose the incident, received
everything from national media
coverage to harsh criticism of
Duquesne University in editorials

from the Pittsburgh Press and
Post—Gazette.

Student. government
representative Nick Cafardi said
that the paper had not been shut
down because of the ad but
because The Dukestaff had kept
an unauthorized checking
account at Mellon Bank and
questions had been raised about
the election process of Drumm.

“lThe election of Drumm] is a
serious problem because
whoever wins [the editorshi pl gets
a scholarship that pays for one
semester of classes," he said.

An editorial in The Pittsburgh
Press said, “One would expect
that action would have been taken
before this because she was
elected to her position two years
ago.”

Drumm never returned to her
position.

About TheDuke’sunauthorized
account, Meltzer‘ said,
“somewhere in the area of
$20,000 had not been accounted
for.”

Jay Biachin, a sophomore at
the time, said, “I think that if the
suspension of the paper was
because of the bank account, the
paper would have been closed
long ago. I don't see what the big
deal is with a birth control ad; this
is a college.”

The student government voted
to reopen the paper, but they
pursued charges against The
Duke.

During the controversy,
McNamara continued his hard-
hitting coverage of the student
government and found that
Meltzer used university funds to
have his car released from the
city impound lot and to send in
his law school applications.

“Happy came up to me in the
cafeteria very mad about the
stories. He was shaking me and
yelling. He wouldn't let me go
until I threatened to call the
police,“ said McNamara.

Meltzer, now at the University
of Miami Law School, had no

comment about his use of student
funds. '

“Attempts to control advertising
in student publications are
growing,” said Marc Goodman,
SPLC ‘executive director,
‘McNamara and The Duke staff
stood up for the principle that
censorship of advertising is no

more tolerable than censorship

of editorial content.”
Goodman, in selecting
McNamara for the Freedom Press

l

Award, cited the tireless efforts
of the journalist in using public
pressure and integrity to demand
press freedom for students.

The award was presented to
McNamara on Nov. 19, 1989, at
the Associated Collegiate Press/
College Media Advisors national
convention in New Orleans.

“The award and the recognition
were nice,” said McNamara, “but
whats personally disturbing is
thatlcensorship of college papers

continues, even at The Duke.
We didn’t win.”

McNamara now goes to St.
John Fisher College and writes
for its paper. As ﬁnal advice to
student journalists he added,
“We made mistakes at 779eDu/ee.
Those mistakes included the
account at Mellon Bank. We
gave the university a perfect
excuse to close or censor the
paper. If you’re going to be
good, then run your ship as
honestly as possible.”

Arm implant may be new contraceptive

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Twenty-four years and ' 16
million dollars later, developers
' at the Population Council, a non-
proﬁt organization that conducts
‘O Qesearch on birth control, say
they have come close to perfection
with a birth control implant called
Norplant.
“The advantages of Norplant
“ are incredible. There is nothing
to remember to take, and the
woman is protected against
pregnancy for up to ﬁve years. If
she changes her mind, the implant
» «can be removed, and she will
soon become fertile again,” said
Sandra Waldman, manager of
public information at the
Population‘ Council.

Norplant consists of six plastic
capsules, each a little more than
an inch long and a tenth of an
inch in diameter. The capsule
contains 36 milligrams of

«F. progestin, a hormone widely used
in oral contraceptives.

“Norplant is not made of new
ingredients. The innovation is in
the way it delivers the
contraceptive drug into the body.
The progestin diffuses through
the walls of the capsules at a

continuous low dose,” Waldman
said. ‘

The capsules are inserted in a
woman's upper arm in a minor
operation that can be done in a
doctor's office. Protection begins
within hours of the insertion.

“A very wide range of women
are candidates for Norplant.
Women can start using Norplant
about a year after menstruation
starts up to close to menopause,”
Waldman said.

Clinical trials with Norplant
started in 1975 and have involved
over 55,000 women in 44
countries.

“Tests have shown Norplant to
be more effective than the pill
and as effective as sterilization in
its first two years, ” Waldrnan said.

Women who weigh over 154
pounds and use Norplant have a
greater chance of getting pregnant
than their lighter counterparts
using the device.

“This problem has to do with
the hormonal levels in the body
and only starts after the first two
years,” Waldman said.

Norplant has already been
approved for distribution in 13
countries, and the Food and
Drug Administration is currently
considering approving Norplant’s



distribution in the United States.
“We are expecting Norplant
to be out on the market within

a couple of months," Waldman
said. .
Norplant is being

manufactured by a company in
Finland and distributed by
Wyeth-Ayrst, a pharmaceutical
company in Philadelphia.

“Right now we are not sure
how much Norplant will cost to
the consumer, but it will
probably be more expensive
than other forms of birth control.
However, when you consider
what something like the pill
would cost for ﬁve years it
becomes very cost- effective,”
Waldman said.

Though no serious side effects
have been reported with
Norplant, some women using it
have experienced a change in
their menstrual cycle.

“For the first six to nine months
there might be more days of
bleeding or spotting between
periods, but after this time it is
virtually worry— free,” Waldman
said.

Playboy twins deny
charges of tax evasion

BySteveMarshall

TODAY/Apple College

Information Network.

Twin sisters from the
Midwest who’ve modeled
nude in Playboy, frolicked in
a “cleavage” ﬁlm, befriended
a millionaire and now face
tax—evasion charges, say
they’ve been wronged.

“How are we going to have
a fair trial when we've been
made to look like whores?”
asked Lynette Harris. “I'm not
a criminal. I’ve never been a
prostitute.”

In their first newspaper
interviews, Harris and her
twin, Leigh Ann Conley, 35,
said they will plead not guilty
Friday at their arraignment.

Since their indictment
became public just before
Thanksgiving, the case has
attracted national attention to
Milwaukee, where the women
live.

“It's been kind of
astounding, really — I guess I
underestimated people’s
interest in this,” said Mel
Johnson, the assistant U.S.
attorney prosecuting the case.

The government charges
that the women failed to pay
taxes ,on at least $1 million
they_received in the mid—1980s
from David Kritzik, a self-rnade
millionaire, who was a
widower.

“The government never told .

me that I owed any tax, so
how can they get me for tax
evasion?” Harris asked.

Prosecutors charge the
women were paid for sexual
services.

“Our belief is that this
relationship was based less
an emotion than the provision
of services,” Johnson said.

Not true, say the women.

“He was my boyfriend, and
I loved him and he loved me,”
said Harris, who spent 1980-

87 with Kritzik.

“He was like a father to me,”
said Conley, adding she was never
intimate with Kritzik, whom she
met in 1982 when she had dinner
with him and her sister. _

Kritzik, unfortunately, can’t
shed any light on the case. He
died in June at age 89. Federal
investigators did take statements
from him, but Johnson, the
prosecutor, wouldn’t reveal what
was learned.

Appearing on the TV show “A
Current Affair,” Harris said if she
and her sister must face the federal
charges, so should thousands of
other women living as mistresses.

Both women say they checked
with Kritzik and their late father,

an accountant, on whether they '

owed taxes on the money Kritzik
provided.

Kritzik, Conley said, told her
“don’t worry, sweetheart — I’ve
taken care of it.” Their father said
as long as they didn’t “earn it,"
the money was a gift and they
didn’t need to pay taxes on it.

Kritzik, who “had othe
girlfriends,” Harris said, built hr
a home in Wisconsin. They als
spent time in his apartment an
in a vacation home in Pali
Springs, Calif.

“We went to dinner and ju
spent a lot of time alone,” Harr
said. “They've made me look lile.
a not—nice person, and I am
nice person.”

Harris began dating Kritzik :

introduced them, said hi

  Goodbye Gottfried. ..

After -four years of coaching football at the University of
Pittsburgh, Mike Gottfried was fired from his head-
coaching position.

N 0 one ever doubted Gottfried’s willingness to catapult

. the Panthers back to the college football prominence that

they held throughout the mid-1970s to early 1980s. The
coach had a yearning desire to win. But despite years of

outstanding recruiting which brought some of the coun-

try’s top high school football players to Pitt, Gottfried just
never seemed to be able to raise his team of top-caliber
athletes to national championship status, their potential
notwithstanding. I ~ ‘ , ,
When analyzing Gottfried’s coaching years at Pitt, one
might make an analogy between the former head coach

7-and that classic Thanksgiving Peanuts cartoon.

. . Like the determined and relentless Charlie Brown who
just couldn’t seem to kick that football through the
uprights no matter how hard he tried, Gottfried’s noble
attempts tocoach his team to Top 10 status were never
attained. There’s one important difference inthis analogy,
though; Charlie Brown had a good excuse — Lucy kept
pulling the ball away. .

Nevertheless, Mike Gottfried was a good person on and

1 off the field. We wish him the best of luck.

. . .HelZo Hozc/eett

The University of Pittsburgh has taken its share of heat
from its search for a coach to replace Mike Gottfried, who
-was fired in December. The university vowed to make an
exhaustive search for the right man to lead Pitt into the
19903 and return the program to the national prominence

it has been without since the early 1980s..

But the search committee needed to look no further
than the current coaching staff. Offensive coordinator
Paul Hackett was named interim head coach following
Gottfried’s dismissal, and just moments before the start of
Pitt’s 31-28 victory over Texas A&M in the Dec. 50 John
Hancock Bowl, he was awarded the job on a full-time
basis. V ,

It’s a wonder that Hackett, 42, was available. His name
was mentioned in the same breath with every coaching

’vacancy in the country. Many people speculated that one ’

year would be all that Hackett would last at Pitt due to his
popularity in coaching circles.

Since 1981, Hackett has coached with the NFL’s San
Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys and Cleveland Browns.
He spent 11 years at USC, three years at the University of
California at Berkeley and one year at Cal.-Davis. He has

. been a top prospect for a number of collegiate head-

coaching positions throughout his career, but his skills
were never rewarded. Until now.
We hope that Paul Hackett proves he has been an

‘ underrated commodity for the past decade, and that the

university allows him the time to forge his concepts and
develop the type of winning program that willereturn Pitt
to the forefront of collegiate football.

who write for this newspaper.
No, I am against gun control;
more accurately, I- believe in the
right to own a gun. In order to
reduce crime, we need laws that
punish criminals, not innocent
gun owners, more effectively.
Advocates of gun control ar-
gue that by restricting gun own-
ership, crime will be reduced.
But criminals, by definition, are
people who don’t obey the law.
So, while gun control prevents
law-abiding citizens from having
guns, it does nothing to deter
criminals from obtaining them.
Remember that lunatic in Can-
ada who recently gunned down
14 people and then shot himself?
Well, the front— page story of the
Dec. 7 Pittsburgh Press stated,
I “The riﬂe [that he used] is illegal

in Canada.” Despite gun—control ‘

laws, anybody who is willing to
disobey the law can obtain a gun.

When people are allowed to
possess guns, a burglar will enter
his victim’s home knowing that
he has a possibility of being shot.
If guns are banned, then it will be
much safer for criminals to ‘enter
people’s homes and do whatever
they want, while the victims
remain helpless.

Gun control is based on the
theory that if a few people are
bad, then everybody should be
punished. Gee, should automo-
biles be banned to end drunk
driving? Should knives bebanned
to end stabbings? Should bananas
be banned to prevent some moron
from throwing the peel in front of
a jogger’s path? I think not

Those who do commit crimes
with guns should be punished,
and I mean severely. Anybody
who threatens somebody with a
gun should get 20 years in jail.
Anyone who dares to pull the
trigger and hits someone should
get 50. And anybody who kills
someone should get life in jail or
death in the electric chair. (The

for good behavior, etc. These
things should be abolished. Like-
wise, furloughs, which let pris-
oners leave jail temporarily in the
midst of their sentence, should
be brought to an end. Plea bar-
gaining, in which a shorter sen-
tence is given in return for a

confession to a less serious crime,
should also be done away with.

One common misconception
states, “The criminal is a victim of
society, and should not be placed
in jail.” I see otherwise. In reality,
societyisa victim of the criminal,
and the criminalshouldbe placed
in jail.

We are often told that criminals
are driven to a life of crime by
things such as child abuse, pov-
erty, mental illness and a host of
other things. But in reality, the
only reason that a person com-
mits a crime is because he or she
chooses to do so. Murderers have
been found innocent because
they were determined to be in-
sane. This is hogwash. Just be-
cause a‘ person is crazy does not
give him or her the right to hurt
other people, or to be exempt
from punishment for doing so.

Many years ago, lawbreakers
went to prison for a long time.
Obviously, they couldn't cause
harm while behind bars. In addi-
tion, any potential villain knew
that he could expect a long sen-
tence if he did commit a crime.

' Today, things are different. People
. know that if they commit a crime,

they will probably go to jail for
only a short time, or maybe even
not at all. Thus, some jerk com-

. mits a crime, goes to jail, comes

 

1 Going back to long prison sen-

tences would end this in-and-out
syndrome and discourage many
people from committing crimes
in the first place.

Many people favor waiting
periods for gun purchases; the
idea being that there should be a
background check for any vio-

N

lent criminal activity beforeqegé

someone can buy a gun. But‘ if”
the prospective gun owner has
such a violent past, then why
isn’t he in jail? ,

Last December, a 16-year-old
shot a schoolrnate and then killed
himself on a bus. This and other

incidents of children misusing
guns have prompted public offi-

cials to push for laws that would 32!"

punish parents who keep their
guns where a child can get to
them. Such laws would be wrong.
As stated above, it is not right to
punish everybody for the actions
of some. Last year, a 16-year-old
friend of mine was home alone.
Two burglars attempted to enter,

but my friend scared them away ,§'§~‘g
with his father's gun. If he didn’t V’

have quick access to the gun, he
might have been dead today.
Even with children much
younger than 16, forcing gun
owners to keep their guns locked
up would be wrong. I can imag-
ine someone saying to a burglar,
“Excuse me. I keep my gunlocked
up. Give me a minute to go get

the key.” Parents who wish to‘
keep their guns locked up should _

be allowed to do so, but it
shouldn't be mandated by law.
I'm sure a lot of you out there
are calling me a “gun- crazed
maniac." Actually, I am not I
don’t even own a gun. But that is
my choice, and if somebody else
does wish to own a gun, I
wouldn't try to make that choice
for them. ' *4

EL PASO, Texas — Mike Gottfried had four years. Couldn't do it

Paul Hackett had 13 days. Did it.

Win a ball game is what.

As the ﬁnal seconds ticked off the clock in the Panthers 31-28
victory over Texas A&M in the John Hancock Bowl, several Pitt
players celebrated by drenching their coach with a jug of Gatorade,
unwittingly and ceremoniously baptizing Hackett into the ranks of
college football coaches. .

Just four hours after being hired. in front of a national television
audience, Hackett showed the Pitt administration what good coaches

Hackett was “acting” head coach for 12 days after Gottfried was
ﬁred because of bickerings with academic and administrative ofﬁcials
on team policies.

Although Pitt looked around, at Barry Alvares of Notre Dame and
Dave Warnstedt for instance, both the top brass and his own players
pretty much knew he would be named coach, that it was just a matter
of time.

.“We would have looked for Paul Hackett in California or Texas or
Timbuktu," Pitt chancellor Wesley Posvar told CBS.

Crossman said. “The way he took control down here and everything.

Inconsistency brings 0-2 start

The Pitt men's basketball team opened its Big
East season last week with consecutive losses to
Syracuse and Connecticut.

Stephen Thompson's three—point play with five
seconds left gave the top—ranked Orangemen a
80-78 victory last Wednesday at the Civic Arena.
Derrick Coleman led Syracuse with 23 points and
14 rebounds. Thompson added 24 points.

Jason Matthews scored 20 points for Pitt,

3 including three—for-three shooting from three-

point range, and Bobby Martin had 18 points and
nine rebounds.

Against Syracuse, the Panthers started quickly,
as they have so many times this season. A three-
point shot by Rod Brookin gave Pitt an early 8-0
lead. a V

Pitt maintained its lead throughout the first half
but seemed to fade toward the end. The Panthers
went scoreless for the ﬁnal 2:45 as Syracuse cut a
10-point deﬁcit to only four. Pitt Coach Paul

for Pant/oers in Big Eozstplozy

Evans said that two missed one-and-one free
throw opportunities at the end of the first half
were critical.

“The missed one-and-ones at the end of the ﬁrst
half were big,” Evans said. “It could have been an
eight-point lead; instead, it’s four.”

Both coaches said that the keys to the game
were rebounding and Syracuse’s fu1l—court
pressure.

The Panthers were out—rebounded 50-36 by the
taller Syracuse front line. Thirty of Syracuse’s
rebounds were at the offensive end.

Pitt center Bobby Martin said, “It was a rough
game. It's the Big East, though. We have to learn
to compensate for the lack of height. We have to
play harder. There’s nothing we can do about the
height. It's not frustrating; you just have to go out
there and try your hardest to get the ball.”

The Syracuse full-court press forced Pitt into
committing 15 turnovers and played a big part in
keeping the Orangemen, who shot only 37 percent,
in the game. The pressure limited Pitt to only 50

The Boise State wrestling team
put a damper on the Pitt Panthers’
weekend. Boise State won the
Panthers’ first home match 24-12,

16-5, to increase his season record
to 15-8. Senior Alan Utter (142

Unlike earlier in the year,
Stottlemyer did not seem too
optimistic; “We just don’t have
it right now. Boise State was

Markel was unable to fulfill

“We're not a great pressing
team, but they're not a great ball-
handling team. The key was,
when they turned it over, we
scored on it, " said Syracuse Coach
Jim Boheim.

Panther point guard Darelle
Porter said, “We had a little bit of
a problem with the press because
they were a lot taller, and we
couldn’t see over them."

After the game, Evans said
tough losses to highly-ranked
teams such as Syracuse and
Georgia Tech would be character
builders for his team.

“The kids played better than
the No. 1 team in the country for
39 minutes," he said. “I think it
will help them, but you’ve got to

Against Connecticut, the
Panthers’ play seemed lackluster
and uninspired as the Huskies
manhandled Pitt, 79-61. It was
Pitt’s first double-digit loss in its
past eight Big East re gular-season
games.

Again, the story of the game
was that Pitt was unable to handle
full—court pressure. The Panthers
committed a season-high 26
turnovers against the Connecticut
press and had the ball stolen 17
times.

The press prevented Pitt from
ever getting its offense in gear.
The Panthers, who had been
shooting 50 percent as a team,
shot only 38.4 percent, and for
the first time this season no Pitt

Connecticut guard Chris Smith
led the Huskies with a career-
high 28 points, the third time this
season that a player has struck
for a career—high against Pitt. Jason
Matthews scored 16 points for
the Panthers, whose record is
now 5-7 overall, and 0-2 in the
Big East.

The start of the Big East season
also marked the beginning of a
change that could beneﬁt the

’ Panthers’ lack of depth. Players

will be allowed six fouls, instead
of five, in the Big East this year
before fouling out of a game.

Pitt has already felt the effects
of the new rule. Four players
accumulated ﬁve fouls in the
Syracuse game, including
Orangeman center LeRon Ellis.
Ellis blocked a Jason Matthews
shot at the end of the game that
would have preserved a Pitt
victory.

NCAA, Bozik discuss shortening sports’ seasons

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

At their annual convention
being held in Dallas this week,
theNCAAPresidents’ Commission
is discussing the possibility of
shortening both the college
basketball season and spring
football practice in order to give
their athletes more time for
academics.

The current college basketball
season begins in early November,
and the‘ postseason tournaments
run until rnid-March. Preseason

practice officially starts about a
month before the first game.

“In principle, we are in favor of
[shortening the basketball
season], ” said Pitt athletic director
Ed Bozik. “The basketball season
is too long. We are in favor of any
legislation that would reduce that.
In basketball, the kids spend an
awful lot of time away from the
university. It's very difficult on
the kids.” » '

If the commission decides to
shorten the season,’

approximately one month of the
playing schedule will be

eliminated.

The PAC 10 athletic conference
already decided to do away with
their league's postseason
basketball tournament.

Bozik is also in favor of
shortening the length of spring
football practice. If the majority
of the commission feels the same
way as Bozik, the spring practice
session will be cut in half.

“It is consistent with our feelings
on the shortening of the basketball
season," said Bozik. “I'm

supportive of anything that would
cut down the time commitment
athletes must put forth to their

sport.

“I’d just as soon see spring
football practice abolished A lot
of coaches may disagree with
that, however."

The commission is also
expected to vote on whether to
have schools submit their athletes’
grades to the media for
publication. In the midst of all the
bad publicity Pitt's athletic

department has been getting
because of academics, one might
think Pitt would want to shy
away from something like that
Bozik feels the opposite way.

“We are delightedly looking
forward to that We've gladly
given [the] media our grades in
the past. No other schools have
volunteered that information. I
think once the records are
straightened out and our grades
are compared to other schools,
people will find that Pitt athletes
rank very high academically.”

EL PASO, Texas — Paul Hackett
did it for the first time, and Alex
Van Pelt and Curvin Richards did
it for the umpteenth time.

The trio triggered Pitt (8-3-1) to
victory over the Texas A&M
Aggies (8-4) at the John Hancock
Bowl, held over Christmas break
in the Sun Bowl Stadium.

Pitt opened the scoring when
Richards plowed over a right
tackle from 12 yards out for a
touchdown. Richards ended with
156 yards and 23 carries and

_ allowed Hackett to successfully

mix up Pitt's offensive scheme.

On the play previous to
Richards’ run, the Panthers faced
a fourth and one from the A&M
23-yard line. Hackett gambled
and went for it. Van Pelt sensed
an Aggies blitz and audibled a
call and dumped the ball over the
middle to tight end Lionel Sykes
who picked up 12 yards.

Lacrosse
team wins
debut in
Pittsburgh

' By Geoff Moskowitz

Staff Writer

The city of Pittsburgh has a
new asset. It comes in the form of
a new Major Indoor Lacrosse
League franchise which will bring
60 minutes of excitement to the
Civic Arena for four nights this
winter.

Their name is the Pittsburgh
Bulls, and their style of play is
synchronous with the team's
name. Friday night, in front of a
crowd of 9,213 fans, the New
England Blazers not only got beat
up physically by the Bulls (1-0),
but were also beaten by a final
score of 14-11. ‘That is no
indication of how one- sided _the
play actually was.

The Bulls not only proved to
be physical but also very capable
of shutting down New England's
power play, including twice while

. two men were down. Credit goes

to Bulls goalie Bruce Donaldson,
a 6-foot-S~inch mass whose frame
makes shooting at the goal like
sinking a putt with a basketball.

For those new to lacrosse, it is
North America's oldest sport,
originated by American Indians.
The Indians used lacrosse, in its
earliest form, as conditioning for
combat or for settling tribal

. disputes. The name was coined

by the French who thought the
stick used to play the game
resembled an element used in a
church ceremony.

The rules in lacrosse are simple
and few. Keep the stick away
from the face, but feel free to
swing or check randomly and
frequently. However, the strategy
is more complex: It is sort of a

See Lacrosse, page 15

“We knew they were a blitzing
team, and we knew we could
take advantage of that,” said Van
Pelt, who threw for 354 yards,
breaking Pitt's single-season
passing record of 2,876 set by
Dan Marino in 1981. Van Pelt
ended with 2,881.

The Aggies fought back and
tied the score at 10 when Pitt
took possession with 1:27 left in
the half.

Van Pelt threw to Olanda Truitt,
who darted 59 yards to the A&M
11—yard line. On third down, Van
Pelt hit Ronald Redmon on a
quick-drop pass from eight yards
out for a score, and the Panthers
went into the locker room a.head..

In Pitt's first possession of the
second half, Van Pelt and Truitt
hooked up again, this time for 32
yards down to the Aggie one.
Van Pelt sneaked in for the TD
on the next play, giving the
Panthers a healthy 14-point lead.

A&M rallied back, however.
Keith McAffee scampered left for

    
       
       
     
         
    

a 31-yard score, and went over
the top from one yard out for
another TD. Randy Simmons ran
it in from five yards out, and the
Aggies took the lead 28-24,
missing all three two—point
conversion opportunities.

Pitt got the ball back with 4:20
left in the game, and Van Pelt did
what he does best; airing it out.

On the third and 10‘ from the
Pitt 16, Lionel Sykes made the.
catch of the year.

Van Pelt’s pass was swatted
away by the Aggies’ defender
Chris Crooms, but Sykes tipped
the ball back in play with one
hand, caught the ball with the
other hand and sprinted up the
sideline before being pushed out
of bounds 28 yards later.

Six plays later, it was third and

_10 again from the A&M 44. Van

Pelt saw something he liked in
the Aggie defense and audibled,
sending Henry T uten long. Van
Pelt heaved a rainbow. The ball
slithered through the hands of

 i1\7o0IIt?Il’m€77i5€75i”50”7d'l3’7MJl-C

Aggie defender Kevin Smith and
into Tuten’s around the 12, who
raced past a stunned Smith for
the winning touchdown.

“You can’t fault Kevin Smith,"
said Aggie coach B.B. Slocum.
“He was in position; he just didn’t
make the play and [Tuten] did.”

“We were just looking for the
first down," Van Pelt said. “But
they showed blitz, and the
cornerback bumped up so he
could cover Henry more tightly,
so I sent him long.”

“There is not much that you
can say [about Van Pelt] that
hasn't been said all year,” said
Hackett. “The man understands
the game. There is no question
where the leadership on this team
is. It’s square on his shoulders. It
showed today."

Van Pelt was selected as the
game’s MVP, but modestly
attriibuted any praise to his
teammates.

“I’m just fortunate enough to
play with quality players,” said

Bowl victory gives new coach perfect record

Van Pelt. “They're the "ones that
made me look good.”

A&M had one last chance to
come back, however, and 2:19 to
do it in.

The Aggies worked the ball up
to their own 47 with 1:08 to go
when quarterback Lance Pavlas
decided to try for ﬁeld-goal
position in one play.

One pass was broken up by

Alonzo Hampton, another was

dropped by tight end Mike Jones.
On the third down Pavlas went
deep, but the pass was snatched
by Pitt cornerback Barry Threats
at the Panther 22.

“We weren’t going to let this

one get away for Coach Hackett,”
said Threats.

A record held by Dan Marino
was
catch for a winning touchdown
to cap a comeback for a new
coach in his first collegiate game.
“This was the perfect game to be
on television,” Pitt safety‘ Dan
Crossman summed up.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, January 8, 1990

WVU-t

A bit of word association to
start off the new year —— which
term in the following group does
not appropriately belong: 1)
boneheads, 2) those who wear T-
shirts which read “I Believe The
Hype,” 3) fools who prove that
the simple tool known as the pen
can amazingly be mightier than
the brain, 4) sportswriters who
voted for Miami as the No. 1 team
in-the country and 5) a Romaine
lettuce salad. ,

My apologies go out to Romaine
lettuce for even insinuating guilt
by association.

Here's the deal — under no
circumstances should the Miami
Hurricanes be the 1989 national
champs. Not that they couldn't
be, but that they just never proved
it.

So, despite my status of being
a self-proclairned non-fan of the

Notre Dame Fighting Irish, I am ‘

pleased to announce the final
standings of TbePx'tz‘News’College
Football Top 5. Forget AP and
UPI. Forget USA Todayand Soorts
Illustrated. This is gospel, the
truth. Trust us, we know what

, we're talking about around here.

1) Notre Dame (12-1)

2) Miami (Fla.) (11-1)

3) Florida State (10-2)

4)rTennessee (11-1)

5) Colorado (11-1)

The Miami Hurricanes were
voted No. 1 because they beat
Notre Dame rather convincingly
(27-10) in both teams’ last regular-

. season game back in November.

“That’s the outward and
seemingly only real reason.

But doesn’tstrength of schedule

like Wisconsin, California,

State, East Carolina and San Diego
State. Granted, they did play Notre
Dame, Pittsburgh, Michigan State,
Alabama and Florida State (which
crushed the ‘Canes). but hey,

  
  
  

those" other guys are just too
many cupcakes for even the
sweetest of teeth.

The combined record of all
Miami's opponents in 1989 was
74—61-4. That's a 53.2 percent
win slate. Take away Notre

 

Dame's record, and the combined
shrivels to 62-60-4. That drops
the win -percentage to 49.2.

' The average record for a Miami
Hurricane opponent was 6-5,
which adds up to 11 games. Which
means the average Hurricane
opponent did not see post-season
action, except maybe at a bar on
New Year’s Eve.

The rejoicing Hurricanes should
be ashamed of themselves.

Notre Dame, on the other hand,
tackled along the way Michigan,

media decided to base the national

championship on one game. “We .

had the best team against the best

going to say who was the best on

understandably irate Lou Holtz.

combination between basketball and hockey. Today, the
Canadian sport is played byamateurs on the Eastern seaboard
but is readily spreading throughout the West.

Brian Nikula is a prime example of the Western talent. Nikula,
the Bulls’ first game-MVP, had a sparkling offensive debut with
four goals and two assists for a total of six points.

Nikula, who arrived at Whittier College (Calif.) too late to
register, decided to play with the Bulls to stay sharp forthe
World Games.

“Talk about a warm reception,” Nikula said. “None of us have
had previous exposure to the city. We decided we’re going to
play with a physical style because it will be most appealing to
[Pittsburgh]. It was the difference in the game. No one was
knocking us down, so we took them out.” .. f

. Being from the West, Nikula -is the exception. In fact,-the
majority of the Bulls reside in Maryland, or the surrounding
area, and commute to the Baltimore-Washington vicinity,
where the team will practice. ‘ c

Patrick Hanley of Maryland added three goals for the Bulls.
David Pietramala and Butch Marino pitched in two goals
apiece. .

The Bulls’ next game will be in Philadelphia to face the Wings
on Jan. 13. I

1 § ' ' L THE P111‘ NEWS, Monday, January 8, 1990

By Thomas Danyluk
Beware the Ides of December 

Friends, students, faculty, lend me your ears.-
I have come, in a sense, to bury Gottfried, not to praise him.
The defeats that coaches suﬁfer live after them.-
The good is oﬂ interred with their bones;

So let it be with Gottﬁied. The noble Bozik
Hath told you Gottfried was ambitious.-

If it were so, it was a grievous fault,

And grievously hath Gottfried answered it.
Here, under leave of Bozik and the rest-

For Bozik is an honorable man;

So are they all, all honorable men —

Come I to speak in Gottfried ‘s departure.

He was a friend, accommodating and kind to me-
But Bozik says he was ambitious;

And Bozik is an honorable man.

He hath brought many victories home to Pitt,
Whose ransoms did the general coﬂerzsﬂll:
Did this in Gottfried seem ambitious?

When the team hath lost, Gottfried hath wept-

Ambition should be made of sternerstuﬂi

Yet Bozik says he was ambitious; '

And Bozik is an honorable man.

You all did hear of a sophomore walk-on in financial trouble
‘Til Gottfried presented him a grant-in-aid,
"Idon’t know thatyou’ll everplay a down, ”

He told Anthony jagers. “I'll tell you

How you can pay me back. Study hard. Graduate.
Be a good person. ” Was this ambition?

Yet Bozik says he was ambitious;

And, sure, he is an honorable man.

I speak not to disprove what Bozik spoke,

But Iam here to speak what Ido know.

You all did love him once, not without cause.-
What cause withholds you to mourn for him?

0 judgement! thou art based on wins and losses,
Thus men might lose their reason. Bear with me,-
My heart is in the empty office of Mike Gottfried.
Yet, regrettably, I force myself to

Understand why this event had to occur.

Shakespeare's tragedy is. alive and well in 1990.

Hackett

Continued ﬁmn page 9

We heard rumors.”

As soon as the CBS cameras
entered the locker room before
the game, the players realized
what was happening.

‘He [Posvar] didn't even get it
out of his mouth and everybody
was going crazy,” said
quarterback Alex Van Pelt,
Hackett’s star pupil.

Hackett looked visibly relieved
after the game, satisfied with his
coaching effort and his team's
performance. He was, however,
also relieved that it was all over,
at least for the time being.

“I’m so exhausted, so drained, ”
he said, “We've got a couple of
days off now, and you better
believe that I am going to take
them.”

His vacationwill be short- lived,

however, because of recruiting

season. Hackett knows that he is

I behind and thatthe recent political

thorn in the athletic department
may have driven some potential

recruits away. But the storm has

been weathered, and with Pitt’s
victory, some calm seas could be
about due. 0

“We’ve_ got a hell of a thing
going. We’ve got something to

- build on now [with a bowl win].

I think that’ll help," Hackett said.

Hackett came to Pitt last year
when former Dallas Cowboys
executive Gil Brandt introduced
him to Gottfried.

After Brandt and Hackett were
ﬁred from the Dallas organization,
Gollfried was impressed-and hired
Hackett as offensive coordinator.

“If anyone had told me a year

ago when I was with Dallas that _
I’d be with [the University oﬂ .,

Pittsiburgh as head coach, playing
a bdwl game, I’d have told them

L‘ D they were out of their minds,”

Hackett said.

After not talking to the media
all year, Hackett stayed and talked
to reporters after the game until
he finally had to be pulled away
by assistant Athletic Director Larry
Eldridge for a radio interview.
That length of time probably
surpassed Mike Gottfried's total
in Pitt's last three home games.

Hackett calls former Cowboys
coach Tom Landry as being the
most inﬂuencial on his coaching
style.

"You can't help but be touched
by him [Landryl," said Hackett.
"He showed me that you have to
have a philosophy on
football.You have to have a belief
that you can never waiver on."

, Hackett said his philosophy is,
that one man must be in charge

on the field, and at Pitt, that one
man is himself. Hackett added

that that is one reason why he I
i was pushed upstairs at Dallas. He

and Landry came to conﬂict about

A control on the field.
