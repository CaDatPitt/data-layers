Textbook

Proposal  
Forwarded

Student Government Pres-
ident John Vrana, in an ac-
tion consistent with the SG

resolution that the Univers- '

ity institute a 10 per cent
discount on all textbooks
and supplies, has forwarded
the proposal to Lawrence L. Mon-
nett, Jr., vice-chancellor for Bus-
iness Affairs.

Student leaders, for the last
several months, have tried with-
out scuccess to contact Monnett
in order to express the student
body’s support for a reduction
on the cost of textbooks at the
University Book Center.

In September, SG overwhelm-
ingly approved a resolution call-
ing for such a discount. Propo-
nents of the plan point to the
systems at Carnegie Institute of
Technology and Duquesne Uni-
versity—-not to mention the Ivy
League “cooperative” stores at
which full-time students receive
either a price reduction or an
annual rebate.

Over 2,000 undergraduates
signed a - SG petition, indicating
their support for. the resolution.
Both documents were duly for-
warded to_ Vice-Chancellor Mon-
nett in September. There was no
reply to the letter.

Since September, Monnett has
been invited twice to attend the
meetings of the Student Affairs
Committee, which is composed
jointly of students, faculty mem-
bers, and administrators. Mon-
nett declined both invitations.

In a gesture of compromis_e,
Vrana proposed on Dec. 11 that
the University grant the students
a ﬁve per cent discount on books,
effective as of the winter tri-
mester, Once again there was no
response.

In his letter to Monnett (Jan.
24), Vrana stated that student
opinion and pressure has been
mounting on this issue and that
a reply would be “in keeping
withthe goals and best interests
of the University.”

Vrana’s most recent correspon-
dence to the Vice-Chancellor, he
told The Pitt News, was prompt-
ed by the administration’s “com-

plete lack of response to our
specific recommendations.”

International Program

Experiments in Living

The Experiment in Inter-
national Living, a private,
nonsectarian organization in
the ﬁeld of international
education,'will send approxi-
mately 2000 Americans
abroad for homestay and
travel experiences in Latin
America, Western Europe,
Eastern Europe, the Middle
East, Africa, and Asia.

Founded in 1932, the Experi-
ment features a month spent .as
a member of a foreign family in
the belief that each nation has
its own perspective on its prob-
lems which can only be fully un-
derstood .when observed from
within.

The Experiment. also includes a
three-week traveling period with
Americans and young people of
the foreign country, not as tour-
ists, but as students seriously in-
terested in immersing themselves
in a different society. Experiment
groups will meet a country on its
own terms, seeing it through the
eye of its nationals and will re-
quire tact, adaptability and a

genuine desire to learn rather

than teach.

Although there is a language
requirement for Romance lan-
guage countries and the USSR,
of primary interest to the Admis-
sion Committee is whether an ap-
plicant can adapt himself to a
variety of situations, including
those which may be physically or
psyschologically uncomfortable.

The applicant must also ex-
hibit .an ability to make the
homestay experience as satisfy-

ing for his host as for himself ‘

and a sincere desire to contribute
personally to international good
will.

Past Experimenters include Dr.
Harlan Cleveland, assistant sec-
retary of state for International
Organization Affairs; Francis H.

Russell, United States ambassa-
dor to Tunisia; and R. Sargent
Shriver, Jr., director of the Peace
Corps.

Further information about the
Experiment in International Liv-
ing can be received by writing to
Putney, Vermont, or by contact-
in: the Office of Cultural and
Educational Exchange, 201 Amos

Hall.

All former and future parti-
cipants in the Experiment pro-
gram will meet today at 7 p.m_ in
201 Amos Hall to form an alum-
ni group. A ﬁlm will be shown at
the meeting.

Pill News

Reviews:

By MATTHEW NESVISKY
Stefan Lorant’s enormous

 

 package, Pittsburgh: The
‘Story of an American City

(Doubleday; 520 pgs.; $10),
virtually surpasses its sub-

-jects in beauty, organiza-

tion-, impressiveness and
over-all fascination.»

One is almost tempted to say
that Pittsburgh does not deserve
such .a startlingly exciting book.
At any rate, the ten years and
tens of thousands of dollars of
research which »went into the
production of the book have re-
sulted in a volume which is at
least equal to the very best of

. its .kind.

What attracts the eye ﬁrst off,
and rightfully so, are the pic-
tures-the book contains more
than 1,000, ranging from early
sketches of -Fort Pitt to the draw-
ings of the long-promised cultural
buildings to come. The best of
the art work lies in .a short series
of early paintings by Samuel Ro-
senberg which, as the entire book

 Pgh: Story of an American

succeeds in doing, captures the
essence, if not the totality of the
City.

The photographs are worth the
price alone, for two reasons: the
landmarks and the faces. The
landmarks, yea, even down to
the unique cobblestone levee at
Forbes and Brady, inspire in na-
tives that secret and silly munici-
pal patriotism, something akin
to that which stirs audiences to
whistling and stamping when an
actor slips in the name of the
hometown during some fast dia-
logue. Unexplainable but loads of
fun.

The faces in the photos are also
compelling. Face-watchers will
have a ﬁeld day following the
pans of the Indians, immigrants,
laborers, millionaires —- the uni-
verse which is Pittsburgh. What
can be read in the Dreiser-dreary
eyes of the l_910 tenants, the
1920 high-livers, the 1930 corner
fruit merchants! And what a joy
it is to pore over the familiar
territory of the mid-century Steel-

 

cs  

town faces (hey, there’s my Papa,
lower right, page 405!) Whatever
they are, they are Pittsburgh.
Occasionally the photo-editing
shows flaws: a few of the gaudy
color snaps of the Point belong
on the cover of the telephone di-
rectory .and nowhere else, and
occasionally the juxtaposition of

, shots is crude: the picture of the
. ’stee1worker’s

picnic is placed
next to that of a Fox Chapel bash
—eﬁective, but crude.

But if anyone photograph mer-
its a Best-in-Show award, it
would be Margaret Bourke
-White's frightening picture of a
pre-smoke control Tarnished Tri-
angle, a creation which best can
be described in J azzman’s jargon
as having “soul.” - ‘

Journalist Lorant’s accompany-
ing texts are straight-forward,
often emotional, .always enlight-
ening. He is, in turn, backed by
contributions from Henry Steele

ald W. J oshson and J . Cutler An-

Tower Conditions Viewed    
As Good Despite Complaints

By DENNIS BLAZIER
A year ago when the Tow-
ers Dormitories opened, the
men moving in complained

about taking showers in cold ~

water and studying in ‘the
dark. Today the shortcom-
ings which they point out
are of a more severe na-
ture - cost, standardness of
‘rooms, and amount of noise. Yet
many admit, in the words of
junior Roy Meckler, that the Tow-
ers “are some of the better dorms
in the country.”

When questioned recently, two
engineering juniors and a sopho-
more in liberal arts all agreed
that there is too much noise on
the individual ﬂoors and that it
carries through the walls too
easily.

One student stated that the
Towers should have a few pay
phones with booths installed in
addition to the ones in the lobby
and maybe on individual ﬂoors
of each Tower. Presently there
is a pay phone on approximately
every third ﬂoor of the Towers.

Another engineering junior dis-
liked the fact that the rooms
cannot be rearranged and that
the standard wall and ceiling
llshts are often insuﬁicient.

“Agreed,” a senior political sci-
ence major explained. They're a
Kafkaesque nightmare. They’re
symmetrical, cylindrical, and

. ‘ identical.”

The $200 a term room fee was
a major source of aggravation
to many who feel the price is too
high compared to rates off-cam-
pus rooms and apartments, which
have the advantage of being free

of University regulations. The

men also complained of the stip-
ulation demanding the purchase
of a $250 meal ticket for the cafe-

. teria.

One of the strong points of the

, dorms, according to Meckler and

others, is the house system,

- wherein every three floors is or-

ed to generate esprit de corps.
“The only trouble is,” commented
senior Tom Parente, “it” doesn't
work.”

Individual room size was also
considered generally good, and
many praised the heat controls
which keep the temperature at
comfortable levels. In spite of all
the complaints the men’s opinion
remained generally favorable to
the dorms. ,

The problems and student opin-
ion concerning the three Towers
were somewhat different when
they ﬁrst opened and received
their nicknames — Ajax, Babo,
and Comet-. At that time, in the
fall of 1963, there were still many
odds and ends in the completed
structure that needed tidying up.

   
  

open. Student reaction to the

Students were ﬁrst faced with
the fact that there were no show-
er heads in any of the new dorms
and no hot water on the top
nine ﬂoors of Tower A. At the
same time, no ﬁghting facilities
existed in any of the rooms and
the University Book Center set up
a desk in the main lobby to sell
$14 metal lamps to‘ interested
students. "

The process of getting the stu-
dents moved in also caused a few
problems. In the basement, the
unloading of luggage caused fre-
quent traffic jams while many
students arrived in the lobby
with no previous application and
asked for rooms. However, most
of the students interviewed then

, viewed the dorms favorably.

Discussions sponsored by the
Student Union Board.

The pieces under discussion
will include: ‘Mozart, “Diverti-
mento in B-ﬂat Major”; Bruch,
“Concerto No. 1 in G-minor for
Violin and Orchestra” with Itz-
hak Perlman as soloist; Debussy,
“Three Nocturnes”; and Britten,
“Variations on a Theme” by Pur-
cell. Refreshments will be served.

The SUB Special Interest Com-
mittee is establishing a service‘

_for depositing Pittsburgh Sym-

phony tickets which students
cannot use, at the SU desk so
that they may be used by other
students. A box for such tickets
will be at the desk beginning
tomorrow.

Three Ski Areas Near Campus ‘

F °l°t° A°d Sk" g G   th
Skiing is the fastest growing sport  the country, especially among college stu-
dents. Students at the University can find first-rate skiing close enough for an easy one
‘day trip-—if they know where to look.
Three of Pennsylvani'a’s major ski areas are within an hour and ahalfdriveof the

campus. All of these areas have ski schools to help both the beginner and the more ad-
vanced skier-to better enjoy the sport. The local. areas are Laurel Mountain, Hidden

Valley, and Seven Springs.

Fifty-ﬁve miles east of Oakland on Route 30, Laurel Mountain is Pennsylvania’s oldest ski area.
Laurel Mountain was developed in the late forties by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh.

It is unfortunate that Laurel has taken until now to improve its facilities. For years the one old
rickety T-bar was the only lift. Two new poma lifts have been added for this season.

The two new lifts are only a moderate improvement, however, since only two of the smal-
ler slopes are serviced. For those who want to be technical, the Laurel Mountain Ski School teaches

the Austrian method.

Hidden Valley is eight miles east of the Don egal interchange of the Turnpike. Visitors this sea-
son will ﬁnd many improvements in facilities. The base lodge has been rebuilt to include a large new
ski shop, along with rental, repair, and restaurant services. The lodge now even has an observation

deck for season-pass holders. Parking space has also been expanded.

The long poma lifts have been added along with a wide slope. This completes the Hidden Val-

ley lift development with a total of four poma lifts and one rope tow.

The Hidden Valley Ski School teaches the Canadian method, and conducts junior programs
which encourage family skiing. The moderate rates and junior programs at Hidden Valley will con-
tinue to add to the family type atmosphere of this Somerset County ski area.

The largest local area is Seven Springs, which is 12 miles from the Donegal interchange. Lift de-
velopment was completed two years ago. The area now has four double-chair lifts, two poma lifts and
two rope tows. Over the summer months a large new hotel and ski shop were built.

Of the three areas, Seven Springs has the largest variety of slopes with plenty of room for
the beginning and intermediate skier. Seven Springs is host to many local junior and senior racing events
and its ski school teaches the American method.Seven Springs, however, offers less of the friendli-
ness and informality among skiers that one ﬁnds at the less commercial areas.

All of these areas offer both day and night skiing. D.aytime hours are from 9 a.m. until 4:30
p.m., and at night from 7:30 until 10:30 p.m. Daytime rates are about $4.50 for lifts plus $4.00 for
rental of skis, boots, and poles. At night it: costs about $2.50 for lifts and another $2.50 for rentals.

More than local ski resorts are needed to make skiers happy. Skiers need snow. Let us all

then “think snow.”

Negro Football /Star

A Negro who was a foot-
ball star when he was a stu-
dent at the University years

"ago, Henry Ford, has been

‘ chosen Outstanding Young

Man of 1964 by the Junior
Chamber of Commerce of
Levittown, Pa.

Levittown, a suburban com-
munity of 60,000, was the scene
of nine days of violence protest-
ing the advent of Negroes in Aug-
ust, 1957. The $12,000’ ranch-
style house in which Ford now
lives was pelted with rocks, eggs
and garbage.

Ford attended the University
on a football scholarship and
played for four years without
missing a game. In 1954, he was
named the most valuable player,
and in that year was drafted by
the Cleveland Browns. They
traded him to the Steelers for
whom he played defensive back
in 1957-58.

Ford was recognized by the
Jaycees for his “untiring_vei.forts
in working with the children” at
the community center. He has
been director and progranr coor-
dinator of the center since last
spring, where in addition to

sports he has instituted an arts
and crafts program, a children’s
library, and a modern dance
class.

One of the leaders of the 1957
group formed to “restore our en-
tire white community” has since
changed his opinion and com-
mented:

.“Mr. Ford is a ﬁne fellow and
is doing a wonderful job for the
children. If all the‘ colored peo-
ple, in fact the people of every
race, were of his caliber, they
would be a credit to any com-
munity.” '

Ford teaches rmathematics in
junior high school and his wife
is a substitute teacher, active in
the NAACP. They have two chil-
dren, one and three years old.

There are now over 20 Negro
familes living in Levittown, and
there ‘have been no further dem-
onstrations since 1957, no mass
exodus of whites, and no drop in
property values.

Despite this reassuring instance

’ of integration and acceptance,

Ford still encounters racial bar-
riers. He would like a job coach-
ing, for instance, but his wife
comments, “The country just

isn’t ready for Neg!) _C9a.ches.”. .

A The mysterious Mr. Monnett is a very busy man. Not only _is he assistant chancel-
lor of business affairs for the University but he has recently been appointed president
of Oak Corp. Though he has repeatedly been invited to StudentAffairsmeetings;to our
knowledge, no student has ever seen him——except John Vrana who met him Monday

The Student Government president was disraught: since September the Senate_
and the rest of t-he student body has been waiting for a reply to a request for a stu-
 dent discount at the University Book Center. Although Vrana has written several let-
“ters to Monnett, including data suporting the proposal, he has received not one word of
It acknowledgement. In fact, the only way Vrana was re-inforced as to the man’s very exist-
-‘ ence is that Dr. Alan Rankin kept assuring the Student Affairs Committee that their in-
 vitation to Mr. Monnett to join them for a discussion was not being overlooked, that
 Mr. Monnett was dreadfully sorry but he was considering the matter.

Q The usual ‘ excuse was a conﬂicting meeting. One time, Dr. Rankin facetiously
' told the Committee that he would kill him self if Monnett could not make it for a lunch-
f eon the group had scheduled, and sure enough, Dr. Rankin and Monnett were grounded

For the Student Affairs meeting last Tuesday as well, Monnett was called into an
important Budget Meeting with the Chancellor, and Dr. Rankin explained byway of an-
V other apology the ﬁnancial straits the University is in at present. The students are try-
Ling to understand this ﬁnancial situation. They really are. But they would also like to
be given the courtesy of acknowledgement after four months time.

i. We commented in a recent editorial how the women’s housing proposals were
“ handled: the administration openly acknowleged the suggestion, held discussions, and
put the ﬁnal plan before a committee which included students. Similarly students were
'-included in a discussion of a new deferred payment plan the University is considering,
 - a noteworthy improvement over the suddenappearance of the Tuition Plan, Inc. last Au-
 gust- We have demonstrated our interest as well as our responsibility: the administra-
tion has begun a positive response which should not be damaged._ '

‘Frat Rat’
Diagnosed

Editor, The Pitt News:

The purpose of this letter is to
question the indirect but subtle
argument of Mr. Fred Frank
which appeared in the editorial
section of the Jan. 15 issue of The
Pitt News. Mr. Frank’s argument
was aimed (as I see it) to prove
the non-existence of the fra-
tassus ratassus in the so-

‘ called fraternity system of the
University of Pittsburgh. fra.
tassus ratassus is the sci-
entiﬁc name for what is com-

to’ use the scientiﬁc term in or-
der to avoid the negative connota-
tions of the vulgar—connota.tions
which are not at .all in accord
with my sympathetic point of
view.)

The main evidence which I
found that Mr. Frank offered to
support the above contention was
that garbage is carried out
“as ever” of the so-called frater-
nity hoiises. This implies, of
course, that there can be no FRA-
tassus ratassus in the houses
(It is well known that the nat-

Winston Churchill: Man of the Century

On the Cornish coast in the southeasten tip of England
there stands a promontory facing out across the stormy
western approach to the English Channel. There atop a
rocky crag, according to legend, the great arch - angel
Michael sits, scouring the sea and air for any sign of danger
to Britain. .

If one could scale that impenetrable height and catch a
glimpse of “the great vision of the guarded mount,” as Mil-
ton called it, there is little doubt but t-hat it would possess
the same granite features of determination as did Winston
Spenser Churchill. “ ‘

But who was this Winston Churchill who saved Eng-
land, and whose words are as famous as those of Hamlet,
Macbeth, or Jesus Christ? What did he do that inspired

I I I thousands to spend night after night kneeling in the winter

cold outside the London home where he lay dying, What
was there in him that caused the sailors of His Majesty’s
fleet to break out in wild celebration when the word was
ﬂashed in 1939 that “Winston is back” as chief of the Royal
Navy even though most of them were not yet born when he

left the Admirality the ﬁrst time in 1915?

EVEN THE MOST scanty references state that he
was, at one time or another in his long life, a soldier of for-
tune, journalist, historian, orator, First Lord of the Admir-
alty, Prime Minister, etc. Yet, England has had a habit in

 A ' her long history of producing men of merit in all these pro-

fessions. . .
It is true enough that Churchill rode in the last great
cavalry charge of history when Lord Kitchener slaughtered

' the fussy-wussy outside Khartoum in 1898, but T. E. Lawr-

ence _ was also a soldier fortune and was instrumental in
saving all of Arabia from the.Turk during the Great War.

During the Boer War Churchill served as a Journalist
and was captured by the Dutch. but managed to escape and
-made his way" half across. Africa to safety. But can this
compare with the exploits of the English Journalist Stanley

’ who found Livingston and charted half a continent?

Churchill was certainly an author of merit. He wrote

it \ sparkling histories of both World Wars, a ﬁve volume biog-

graphy of his famous ancestor the .ﬁrst Duke of Marlbor-
ough, and the Nobel Prize winning History of the English
Speaking Peoples. But England has also produced Macau-
lay, Southey, Gibbon and Carlyle, whose -histories are still
being devoured today.

AT THE BEGINNING of both World Wars, Churchill

served as First Lord of the Admiralty and helped the ﬂeet
during the crucial ﬁrst months of those conﬂicts. It was
Churchill’s idea to storm the Dardanelles in 1915, an oper-
ation that, if successful, might have saved Russia from
Red revolution by opening up the Black Sea ports to British
supplies and munitions. _
‘ Yet who would compare this with the accomplishments
of Lord Barham who piled combination upon combination
ti1l.the French and Spanish were so frustrated they sailed
to meet Nelson at Trafalgar? . _

And what of the _Pitts? It is true that Churchill was
the most gifted speaker of this century, and, as Edward

I’ Murrow said, “marshalled the English language and led it

forward into battle.” But these, things were __a.1SO Said Oftlhe

fl younger William. Pitt who boundthe ‘Islandpeopleftbgétheifi’

 
 

 Mauser. .. . .  .  ..

   

when Napoleon threatened from across the channel with all
Europe at his back. ' ’
Certainly Churchill became prime minister in one of

the darkest hours of his nation’s history and led it forward_

to victory, but so did the elder Pitt who arranged the cap-
ture of Canada and India and made the English nation into
the British Empire. Of him it was said, England has been
in labor for a thousand years and has finally produced a
man. - V

IT MAY SEEM from these comparisons that Chur-
chill has to be rated behind many of his fellow Englishmen,
yet there is a slight bit of illogic contained in the analysis.‘

T. E. Lawrence was never First Lord of the Admiralty,
Gibbon was never asked to become Prime Minister, Lord
Barham didn’t know a thing about writing, and neither of
the Pitts would ever have considered riding in a cavalry
charge. Churchill, however, did all of these things. ‘

He possessed, in a sense, a combination of the better
qualities and drives of Lawrence and Stanley and Southey
and Gibbon and Barham and both Pitts.

The sum total of his worth, however, cannot be arrived

. at by simple addition. Churchill was one of those mathe-
,matical curiosities who come out to be inﬁnitely greater

than the sum of their parts.

Multiply Lawrence by Stanley "by Southey by Gib-
bon by Barham etc." and the answer .3-Pproaches Winston
Churchill. . i

In those dark days when England stood alone and the
full might of the German Luftwaffe was hurled at London
and Nazi U-Boats prowled the Atlantic and strangled Brit-
ish commerce, Winston Churchill told his countrymen that
this was their ﬁnest hour.

WITH THE CARE of a’ physician using his most po-
tent drugs, he shaped the English language into a mighty
bludgeon and smoteunmercifully the enemies of democracy.

But more than that he was the heart of that Lion, if
not_its very soul. His black cigar, snarling expression and
V for victory sign characterized the determination of the
British people. Churchill was,_,in a sense, the vision of
England. —

‘His six volume history of the Second World War was,
in essence, the autobiography of this portion of his "life. In
the ﬁrst book of the work, The Gathering Storm, he set
forth the moral of the entire series, and, it might be said,
the moral of his whole life: . ’ ‘

ural habitat of the FRATASSUS
RATASSUS is garbage.) BUT this

- does not necessarily follow. It is

more indicative (1) that there is
a great deal of garbage in the
places mentioned and (2) that
great or even religious signiﬁ-
cance is attached to garbage. We
are told, for example, that in “the
best of all possible worlds . , . at
lunch . . . the sacred duty (was)
taking out the garbage.”

Also to support his argument,
Mr. Frank pointed out that the
so-called fraternity “brothers” no
longer take their “members-in-
training” to Panther Hololw or to
the county morgue, nor do the
new. members have to learn gro-
cery lists. Rather, the trainees
are now taken to lunch on North
Dithridge or North Belleﬁeld and
to dinner at a downtown hotel
(What’s wrong with the Web-
ster?) or country club andfinally,
in place of “a cat of nine tails,”

to the Symphony Ball.

All of this is encouraging to
know, but in the context of the
main thesis this latter evidence
may only mean that bigger and
better garbage has been found
elswhere-—a change which may
have been prompted by purely
practical necessities introduced

‘by new laws, urban pest control

Programs, etc. In short, better
conditions for the fratassus

in for a freshman English
class, ﬁfteen of them will be
ghost written or copied. “So
speaks the voice of experi-
ence -- thepstudent who
cheats._ ‘

Two “experienced” members of
the student body have been in-
terviewed anonymously. They told
how they cheat and where they
feel the blame for cheating lies:

> What kindof classroom is it
easiest to cheat in?

Any kind. It’s no easier in
large lecture rooms. They can
separate you there. .

—-Nah, it’s easier to cheat in a
big room. If you’re in a big lec-
ture room the teacher only has
one pair of eyes. Usually there
aren’t any proctors — and if
there are, they’re dumb.

> What techniques do you use
inside the classroom? »

—-Well, talking to a friend next
to you or switching tests, where
friends ﬁll in the answers you
don’t know and where you ﬁll
in the answers they don’t know.
Crib sheets and eye-checking are
very common.

There is a lot of taking tests
for other kids in large classrooms
where the teacher doesn’t know
you. The average test-taker is
paid $25 per exam. Once I took a

— test for another kid; I didn’t

charge. I got away with it. It was
a ‘math test with about. 200 kids
in the class. I just walked in.
Even when teachers take pre-
cautions, there’s plenty of ways
to beat the system. If they hand

out A and B tests and you’re sup- _

posed to have a B test, just pick
up an A test instead when they’re
being passed down the row.

me, and just look at other tests.
Looking is the worst of the three
evils. First of all the teacher will
sometimes catch your eye and
that’s very bad psychologically
for the cheater. And besides, you
lose your place.

Teachers are getting smart
though. Like for instance it isn’t
so easy to bring a blue book al-
ready written in. The teacher

will use only one package of blue-

books for the class and he can
tell by the staples if the blue
book is from the package he dis-
tributed, "

I’ve taken tests for kids too.
Usually it pays nothing. I did it
for a friend, to see the kid get
through the course.

It’s easy to copy things like
lab reports, too, There’s plenty of
methods like passing a question
sheet down a row with the an-
swers penciled in.

> How do you cheat outside
of the classroom?

—Ghost writing is very preva-
lent. I have a paper due on Fri-
day and I’ve been looking since
last Friday for someone to write
the paper for me; I’ve ﬁnally
given up. I couldn’t plagiarize it,
so I decided to write it myself.

A lot of the time if you pay a

kid to writemthe paper his fee Will -

be based on how good a grade
you get.

Another good method is get-
ting friendly with graduate assis-
tants. If they’re the opposite sex,
date them and make buddies
with the others. They’ll help you
out with your grades.

—Once we offered some guy
who took care of the supply cab-
inet $200 is he gave us the ﬁnal..

lies for cheating?

——Teachers. There isn’t a teach-
er in the school who doesn’t know
that cheating isn’t going on in
the classroom. In the moral code
of the University student body

 

no condemnation of

Two clutch foul shots by West
gave

Field House, 76-75. Two thou-
sand four hundred and ﬁfty-ﬁve
fans, mostly West Virginia root-
ers, saw the second meeting of
the season for the two clubs go
to the Mounties.

Cavacini made the ﬁrst of his
one and one foul shots and then
sunk the second with 11 seconds
left for the victory. The Pan-
thers got the ball 1‘ down court
quickly enough, but Roth Mc-
Nally missed everything with a
jump shot and the ball went
over to West Virginia.

Mild tempered Panther Coach
Bob Timmons anger was stirred
after the play by McNally and
several of the , oificia1’s calls.
“One of the more experienced
boys on the squad should have
told Roth what to do. We didn’t
have any time outs left so we
should have waited for a better
shot. ,

The so called home court ad-
vantage seems to apply every

where but at the.Fitzgerald Field
House. ’l‘immons was quite dis-
turb_ed at some of the calls. One
of the plays was a foul call on
Bob Lovett after he had pulled
down a rebound.

“The West Virginia man (Ben-
ﬁeld) was ready to raise his
hand when the official blew the
whistle, but the official called
it on Lovett. I thought it was a
poor call.”

Another important play late
in the game was a steal by the
Mountaineers Bob Camp. With
the Panthers losing by one point
Bob Lovett had the ball in the
right corner and started to go
into the key and lost. the ball.
This set the stage for Cava-
cini’s foul shots because the Pan-
thers had to get the ball again,
so they had to foul intentionally.

The loss made the Panther
record a disappointing 3-9 but

. the game was probably the best
the Panthers played all year.
They shot 46 per cent on ﬁeld
goal attempts and 85 per cent
from the free throw line.

The team also played together
very well especially in the scor-

 Win Battle For Mountaineers

ing department. When one man
was hitting his teammates would
pass to him. Bob Lovett scored
six straight points for the Pan-
thers and ﬁve straight near the
end of the game. Daryle Ruby
and Larry Szykowny had hot
streaks. At the end of the ﬁrst
half sub guard McNally hit two
jump ‘shots from 35 feet to give
the Panthers a 38-37 halftime
lead.

Bob Lovett was high’ scorer
again for the Panthers as he had
a deadly jump shot from about
15 feet that West Virginia could-

’n’t stop. He hit on eight of 15

from the ﬁeld and was ‘ﬁve for
six from the free throw line to
give him 21 points. Larry Szy-
kowny also seemed to ﬁnd the
home hoops more to his liking
as he hit for 19 points. Daryle
Ruby had 15 points.

High scorer for the Mountain-

eers was Bill Maphis with 16,
Cavacini had 15 and Dave Palm-
er and Bob Beneﬁeld had 14
each. The win for West. Virginia
makes the all-time record 102-100
in favor of the Mountaineers.

Rex Peery Predicted Poor Mat Season

By BILL CABIN
When the wrestling sea-
son - began three weeks ago,
coach Rex Peery. said, 5‘This_
"could be my worst season in‘
fourteen years.” After their
loss to Michigan State Sat-
urday, the matmen are 0-3,
and Peery’_s unpleasant fore-
cast seems right.

Peery’s main problem is lack
of depth. “We’re short’-handed in
the heavier weights,” said Peery,
“and we don’t have much depth
on the squad!’ Without depth,
Peery is unable to have competi-
tion among the wrestlers for
weekly positions.

Usually there are two or three
wrestlers in each division vying
for a chance to wrestle. Each
weekthe teams holds a “wrestle-

off” between the wrestlers in ’

each division . to ‘determine who
will wrestle in the next meet.
Peery still holds a weekly
wrestle-off, but there are only 14
varsity wrestlers V'ying for the
nine positions. Several times it
becomes a matter of elimination,
with the loser of the wrestle—oif
in one divsion getting the start-
ing position in the next division.
This week, for instance, Peery

has ‘four wrestlers vying for four
positions, and the decision will

- track competition but Coach Rees

  

MORT STANFIELD goes over the top for a high jump of five-feet
11 inches in Saturday’s track meet with Kent State.

Rees Pleased By

Track Showings

. Track coach Carl Rees is one happy man. And he has
a right to be happy after his team’s win against Kent State
on Saturday. “There's no question that our boys gained
some conﬁdence,” said Rees.

When high jumper Dave Sallach Wrenched his back
and still won -his event; when Jim Flanigan ﬁnished a strong
second in the shot put despite an injured wrist; when Jim
Studnicki proved he could run on a Wood track by winning
the 1000-yard run; when Bill DelVecchio set a Field House
record _ in the 600-yard run the
first time he ever entered the
event; and when John Bailey and
Dave Eichenlaub easily won the
two mile run. Coach Ree’s com-
ment that he was pleased with
some of the showings is a gross

Kent State is not in the same
class as the service academics in

still credits his team for some
ﬁne performances. “We have
some good boys and a lot of hard
workers,” said Rees. “I only wish
we had Slippery Rock scheduled
between the Army and Navy
meets for a sort of breather. We
have a ﬁne group of runners and
some good potential in the ﬁeld
events. This makes for a well
balanced squad.” ' 4 , -.

Recovering
From Insult

The gymnastics team is lick-
ing two wounds inﬂicted by pow-
erful Penn State last Saturday.
One is the 94-26 ‘drubbing and
another is an unintentional in-
sult by the Lion announcer prior
to the match.

His announcement concerned
three players who recently had
become ineligible for the squad:
Joe Leonard, Bob Davies, and
Jack Schwar. The number of per-
formers was correct but-the in-
eligibilty occurred prior to the
season.

For Tankmen

Hampered by inexperience and
academic difficulties, the swim-
ming team welcomes the return
of long-distance swimmer Frank
Reed who missed the .meet
against Ohio University because
of ’a bad cold.

Before missing the Ohio meet,
Reed had captured second place
ﬁnishes in the 200 and 500-yard
freestyle events against strong
Army and another in the 500 at
Maryland. Coach Ben Grady con-
siders Reed, a senior, and sopho-
more Mike Olesak his best long-
distance strokers.

Grady hopes Reed will be ready

for Miami of Ohio on Saturday. ’

“We only had seven men there
and I guess it was necessary to
explain this somehow."

Actually only one of 0 those in-
eligible players, Joe Leonard,
might have helped the squad, par-
ticularly on the horizontal bar.
The gym team is obviously short
in depth and Neiger realizes that
this is what is hurting them.

THERE'S A FUTURE FOR YOU WITH . . . 

 

It's been written that “variety is the spice of life.”
But at many companies it’s diﬂicult to obtain a
wide range of work experiences. A college gradu-
ate can join a company, get locked into one type
of activity and stay there and stay there and stay
there. That's not the way we do it at Ford Motor
Company where our young men may work in
several areas to develop their full capabilities. We
believe that a thorough grounding in many phases
of our business is one of the best ways to cultivate '

management talent. An example: Bob Anderson

of our ﬁnance staff.

Since Bob came to us in July, 1963, he’s been
actively involved in ﬁve important areas of the Company. As a member
of our ﬁnance staff, he has reviewed budget and_ cost programs of a division
marketing cars, another manufacturing tractors and subsidiaries engaged
in automobile ﬁnancing and insurance. In addition, Bob was selected to
assist in the 1964 national labor-management negotiations. His present
assignment is as a staff budget analyst for product engineering and styling.
Because of experiences like these, Bob will be able to channel his career
toward the activity that interests him ‘most.
As a large automobile concern, Ford Motor Company needs people who
can handle a wide variety of ‘assignments. Our college graduates come to
us with all types‘of educational backgrounds. And many of them move
into management positions unrelated to their degrees. If a fast-moving
career appeals to you, see our representative when he visits your campus.
He may have the spice for your future.
