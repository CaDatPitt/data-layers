The doctors, clinicians and _

legal were honored at
Benedum Hall on Saturday at a

Women’s Organization.

“No amount of harassment or
picketing my house will turn

Former M TV ’’Real

discusses ”real ” issues  

By Monika Colbert

Staff Writer

'-fevin Powell, former cast

gmber of MTV’s “The Real
World,” spoke on the real issues
of hip hop culture Thursday
night at the Masonic Temple.

“Hip hop is more than just
music. It’s all artistic expression
under that culture. It’s how you
wear your hair, your clothes,
language, art and form on
stage.” A

Hip hop is so broad, said
Powell, it has crossed over the
barriers of segregated neighbor-
hoods and into the lives of

mainstream ‘society. ‘It is not just
black youth any more who have
adopted the clothes and music
of this culture,.he said.

Even the media has jumped‘
on the hip hop bandwagon,
according to Powell.

“Hollywood can’t get enough
of hip hop. It has become the
basis-for movies like “CB-40,”
“Menace 11 Society,” “House
Party 3” and many others.”

Powell discussed why rap
music is viewed byjso many
people as-violent. He suggests
that people who think this way
should “think [about] what’s

Wade anniversary commemorated by students

Students for Life march in D.C. 

By Stephen Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

WASHINGTON, D.C. —
Slippery ice-covered side-
walks, frigid temperatures and
President Bill Clinton’s health—
care proposal couldn’t hold
back the enthusiasm of the
50,000 March for Life protest-
ers in Washington, D.C., on

Friday.

Protesters chanting, “Hey
hey ho ho,_Clinton has got
to go” and other slogans,
included a busload of 34
Pittsburgh college students
from Pitt, Duquesne
University and Carnegie-
Mellon University.

Pitt Students for Life helped

selves and others interested in
marching on the eve of the
21st anniversary of the Roe vs.
Wade decision that legalized
abortion.

First-year’ Pitt student Kristin
Michaels was one of several
first-time marchers who

thought the day was a success .

and exciting.

According to Kathy Wilson of
the National Organization for
Women, their ultimate goal is
individual and collective free-
dom, especially for poor
women. “The Casey administra-
tion has a total commitment to

obstruct poor women from

fare services and reproductive
freedom.

“How many women, how
many poor women, how many
African—Americans, how many
Latinos do you know that have

 .Forum focuses on self reliance

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

“Reach out and touch someone” is more
than just the old AT &T advertising slogan.

According to Dr. Andrew Billingsley, it’s a
major key to the advancement of the modern
African—American family. a

“We have a responsibility to reach out and
help those who are struggling,” Billingsley
said. “If we  help those in danger of losing
their way, we’ll have a better chance of mov-
ing the whole group ahead.” ,

Billingsley, a sociologist who specializes in
studies on African—American families, spoke
Friday at Pitt’s School of Social Work
Community Forum in Frick Fine Arts
Auditorium. His new book, “Climbing Jacob’s
Ladder,” consists of several stories about the
history of the African—American "family, current
problems facing urban families and ways to
solve them.

“The single—parent family is a problem,”
Billingsley said, “but my book is about solu-
tions.” .

Billingsley said through self—determination
and a bit of a helping hand, single inner-city
mothers can overcome their obstacles
and escape the drudgery of poverty. He told
a story of a young woman named Patricia
who turned her life around by leaving the
alleys of the inner city for the halls of higher
education.

“This single mother ‘had dropped out of
school to get a job to support her baby,”
Billingsley said. “A social worker told her to go
on welfare and go back to school.”

According to Billingsley, the woman
returned to school, but her success did not end
with her high school diploma. She enrolled at
Coppin State University in Baltimore and went
on to a career in medicine.

“She did so well [at Coppin St.l that by her

Bands, music encourage harassment awareness

By Cameron Harvey
Staff Writer

Benedum Hall rocked Friday
night as local bands played a
beneﬁt concert, sponsored by
the Campus Women’s
Organization, the University
Democrats and the Office of
Residence Life,-to combat sexu-
al harassment against women.

The proceeds went to
the Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape, Off Our Backs —— a
women’s literary magazine —
and the Sexual Harassment
Task Force.

“I know they’re all feminists,”
said Guin Grogan, a Resident
Assistant and director ‘of the
concert. “Skablins and Anti-

«Flag are personal friends 

What is important is that almost
all of the bands are men that

care and can make a differ- t

ence.”
The other bands playing were
Step Left Foot, Blind Sight and

‘special guest Liz Berlin of

Rusted Root. .
Blind Sight, in one of their

first public performances,
kicked off the evening with
a hybrid funk/African groove
as the singer chanted, “Don’t
harass the women, leave
them alone.” From that
point on, they played through
a 45-minute set, periodically
giving commentary on
the problems of sexual harass-
ment.

During set changes, Shira

Hassan, co-president of CWO, _

spoke to the audience about
the problems of sexual harass-
ment.

“There are "two terms that
apply to sexual harassment in
the workplace,” said Hassan.
“One is when a demand
is made ‘on a woman to
exchange sexual favors for
employment benefits.

The second is called ‘condi-
tion of work’ where sexual
advances exist as a part of
the job but are not explicitly
tied to a condition of employ-
ment.”

According to Hassan, “Your
body could be used at any

She went on to quote statis-
tics that the average model is
5’8” and 110 pounds whereas
the average woman is 5’4” and
140 pounds. “Approximately
3 percent of women represent
91 percent of our entire gen-
der.” '

Following Hassan’s speech,
Liz Berlin of Rusted Root took
the stage along with a drummer
to play, among other songs,
“Moon,” which deals with the
healing process of sexual
harassment.

Step Left Foot played next,
offering a set filled with
screechy, distorted guitars and
watery vocals from a singer
who never faced the audience
throughout the entire perfor-
mance. .

Next came Anti-Flag, a three-
piece punk band which played
a fiery set. The singer, amid
countless obscenities, asked the

audience to get up and “enjoy
themselves.”

Pat Thetic, drummer for
the band, said, “We believe
whole-heartedly in the cause. It
is definitely something to be
involved in. Punk is about the
oppressed, and women are the
oppressed.”

Finally came the Skablins F

to an excited audience. The
band is self-described as a mix-
ture between “ska, jazz and
punk.”

“Seeing so many men out
here is really nice. It shows that
some men really do care, there
are some good guys out there,”
said Bianca Stoner, co-president
of CWO.

Shira Hassan, also co-presi-
dent of CWO, said, “I’ve never
seen so many men with so
many ‘woman symbols’ on
them,” referring to the admit-
tance mark drawn on each con-
certgoer. “It’s kind of liberat-
ing.” '

Grogan said that she was
“amazed at the turnout.” Over
$500 were raised.

“We were walking up the hill
to the Capitol and looking at
all the people ahead of us,
and then we turned around
and looked back and saw
the people all the way back
from where we started,”
Michaels said. “It was pretty
amazing.”

After the march, Sfl planned
on meeting their local congres-

sional representatives, one of
whom was U.S. Representative
William J. Coyne.

“He chickened out,” Michaels
said, referring to one of Coyne’s
aides telling the group that
Coyne would be unable to
speak with them. The group
was able to speak with another
U.S. Representative, Rick
Santorum.

“I’ve never been that close to

someone that high up in power
in this country,” Pitt Sﬂ. member
Jenn Hogan said after the
group’s meeting with Santorum.
“I thought how down-to-earth
he was, and he really seemed to
care.”

According to Hogan, the deci-
sion to march is a complicated
one that not all people want to
make.

Bianca Stoner, co-president of
CWO, told the spectators not to
underestimate the power of the
religious right movement.
“lTheyl believe that all lives
are valuable as long as the
mother is white, heterosexual
and middle—class. So what if she
can’t afford to raise the child? As
long as she doesn’t have an
abortion, the pro-lifers see it as
a victory.

“As Senator Edward Kennedy
once stated, ‘Life, to the
pro-lifer, begins at conception
and ends at birth.’ Some pro—lif-
ers believe that all contracep-
tives are forms of abortion. If
we are complacent for one
moment, our rights will be
taken away from us,” Stoner
said.

nothing if no one is left to pro-
vide it,” said Suzy “Captain
Mom” Fischer, one of the lead-
ers of the Pittsburgh pro-choice
movement.

“This rally is to show respect
for the thousands of women
who died because they didn’t
have a choice  doctors don’t
need to be abortion providers.
They chose to do so, to [help
women] to control their own
bodies.”

According to Fischer, the goal
of the pro-choice movement is
to continue to provide escort
services as long as they are
needed. Not all of the escorting
is necessarily abortion-related
either. ,

‘‘\We’ve taken in a cancer
patient with her husband plead—
ing with the protestors to leave
her alone, ‘She has cancer.’ The
escorts will be there as long as

Escort Nancy Tilden said, “We
are trained to get the patient [to
the clinic] without getting
involved with the anti’s. Not
one of us had ever been arrest-
ed outside a clinic.”

Another escort, Michael
Pennock, said, “[The pro-lifers]
had all of 46 people out
there and I’m glad. T hey’re feel-
ing a little worn out, but they
haven’t left forever. I think that
this is going to be a long-term‘
fight.”

Spectator Rachael Barrett, a
Pitt junior, agrees.

“There is legislation at the
local levels to stifle abortion
such as not including it in
health plans and making
parental/spousal consent
mandatory. I don’t think that
the fight will end. The beliefs
held on each side are too
strong. You can never change

one of those people that didn’t
want to say that I wouldn’t

Hogan said. “That’s how most
people are. They don’t want to
get involved in a controversial
issue.”

Hogan decided to march for
the first time this year because
she finally wanted to take a
stand.

He pointed to the story of a

South Carolina by commandeer-

worked.

“The ship’s white captain
and crew went ashore for
some R&R, and when they
came back at 2 a.m., the
ship was not there,” Billingsley
said.

Billingsley said the slaves
drove the ship through
Charleston Harbor, picked
up their wives and families and
sailed north to freedom.

“It’s just one example of what
blacks have done for them-
selves,” he said. “They had
pride in their communities, and

families.”

pride if a community is to suc-
ceed.

He said people should look
at both sides of an issue
rather than seeing only the neg-
ative.

“There are many more of
us that are fortunate than
are unfortunate,”. Billingsley
said.

“If one—third of inner-city
African-American families are
poor, that means that two-thirds
are not poor  and if 25 percent
of black youth are in trouble
with the law, that means a
majority are not in trouble with
the law.

“Those who are privileged
and help those who are under-
privileged will leam much more
about the diversity of the black
community than we’ll ever learn
by comparing blacks to whites
on an item-by—item basis,”
Billingsley added.

In fact, according to

THE PI'lT NEWS, Monday, January 24, 1994

Billingsley, comparing people
may serve no purpose at all.
In “Climbing Jacob’s Ladder,”
he states that, on the basis
of research by archaeolo-
gists Louis and Mary Leakey
in eastern Africa in the 1920s,
civilization actually began
in Africa and not in‘Europe
or Asia as previously
hought

“Each year or two a new
discovery is made support-
ing the African genesis
of human civilization,”
Billingsley said.

“Africans moved out of
Africa to other parts of
the globe, and as they stayed
there they had to develop
and adapt their characteristics 
that’s Why there are so
many people looking different
today.

“We are one race —— the
human race,” Billingsley added.
“We’re all parts of that.”

happening to ourculture
and who’s controlling it.”
For example, Powell said
that it was some news
writer who pulled the
word “gangsta” out of a
song and coined the term
“gangsta rap” to which rap
music is commonly
referred.

According to Powell,
the reason why rap is con-
troversial and why the
people behind the per-
formers‘ control what final
product comes out to the
people is that it sells bet-
ter one way than another.

“It’s not threatening for
black people to get on
stage and say ‘f—— white
people,’ but if they spoke
out on white supremacy
or how guns and drugs
got into our neighbor-
hoods, then it would be a
different story,” said
Powell.

“Rap music is rhythmic,
American poetry. It is a
reaction to racism and cul-
tural imperialism, and the
first time voices of young
black people [have been
heard] since the civil rights
movement. Rap music is
the voice of our genera-
tion,” said Powell.

Audience member
Bryan Morrison said, “The
discussion given by Kevin
Powell was an enlighten-
ing and inspirational
event. The factual topics
should be more than just a
speech, it should bring
action and advancement
for our people.”

Change of focus

On Friday, Dr. Andrew Billingsley spoke at the
University of Pittsburgh’s School of Social Work’s
Community Forum. He was here to discuss his book
“Climbing Jacob’s Ladder.” The main point of his book
is that although broken homes are a problem, they
don't have to condemn their members to a life of
poverty and despair. Far too often, when these prob-
lems are brought to light, the discussion focuses strictly
on the problem and where to place the blame.
However in these exchanges, no thought is given to
solutions. Billingsley attempts to suggest solutions, and
this is the tack his book takes.

He makes the important point that, although there
are problems inherent in thesystem, self-determination
is the most important factor in living a better life.
People must change themselves despite the system. It’s
not a matter of pulling oneself up by one’s own boot-
straps, but of learning to make use of the resources
that you do have to increase your standard of living. As
Billingsley points out through the examples in his
book, what happens is usually an upward spiral.

Byacting on their own, people who try to make a
difference for themselves not only gain a better life,
but also gain more options for their families. While"
making full use of every option the system offers, one
should never forget the value of personal initiative. It is
personal initiative that provides the key to the doors
which everyone wants to open.

Opening lines .

Last Friday, the Campus Women’s Organization spon-
sored a concert to fight sexual harassment. Proceeds
went to Pittsburgh Action Against Rape; Oﬂ Our Bac/es,
a women’s literary magazine, and the Sexual

Harassment Task Force. Several local bands earned_

exposure, and a good cause was brought to the fore in
an entertaining way.

' It is imporiant to remember that although awareness
of ‘sexual harassment has grown, it is still a problem
faced by women today. There are common" actions in
everyday life which create a hostile environment for
people in allwalks of life. The positive aspect of this
rally is the manner in which it brings this problem to

. light. Using popular culture to educate people is better

than continuously reciting statistics" which people tend
to ignore or claim are not representative of the real

‘world. Awareness must come not only from statistics.

and studies, which should never be neglected, but also
from the mindset of currents in society.

The way to remedy a problem is to change the mind-
set of those lI1V-,QlV€Cl. To do this, people must be
reached in creative ways. The Campus Wom.en’s
Organization has set a strong example for other groups
seeking to make people aware of problems. Reaching
out into the culture of college students not only
‘increases awareness, but broadens minds. ‘

There were many who were
ready to write the obituary for
the “religious right” with the
election of its public enemy
number one, Bill Clinton, to the
presidency of the United States.
I tend to agree with that assess-
ment, but for different reasons
than most. With all its adher-
ents’ talk about so-called bibli-
cal Values, it’s clear the reli-
gious ‘right doesn’t believe what
the Bible says on anything out-
side of their own agenda,‘ and
that’s what will destroy their
movement.

I first encountered the reli-
gious right in 1980 as a student
at Georgia Tech. I was attend-
ing a fundamentalist church in
an Atlanta suburb. I only went
there because I knew people
who did. The pastor had had
major surgery and was out of
the pulpit for threefmonths.
When he returned, he began
preaching against “secular
humanism," and began to push
conservative politics from the

pulpit. As I don’t consider
v myself a conservative, I had

problems with that. The church
even endorsed Reagan for pres-
ident. At once, I realized that
something didn’t quite add up.
When I returned‘ to
Pittsburgh, I noticed that there
was a large-scale movement
going on. I learned about the
Moral Majority, the 700 Club,
Concerned Women for
America, Focus on the Family,
and other groups. The trouble
was, what they were teaching
didn’t square with what I’d
learned in the strict Calvinist
tradition in which I grew up.
The thrust of the religious
right, and its eventual downfall,
is its strange mix of conserva-
tive politics and liberal theolo-
gy (liberal in the sense that it
“takes liberties” with the Bible).
Its proponents seem to think
that by voting the right people
into office — that if we can
somehow “get back to God” —
thisnation will turn around
spiritually and morally.
Specifically, if Americans would

Religious right doesn't belong in ofﬁce

end legal abortion, drive homo-
sexuals back into the closet
and defend themselves against
communism then God will
bless them. They’ve called on
all evangelical Christians and
others to join their crusade.
However, there were a few
things that they didn’t take into
account — like t~heir_own
inconsistency. They com-
plained about “big ‘govern-
ment’’ in this counf,  d yet
threw their support t6 title mast
bureaucracy of South Africa.
They wanted government to
stop providing essential ser-
vices but proposed no practical
replacements. From the outset,
it was exposed for what it was
—— a power grab that misused
God. (See the . Third

 N owlin

Commandment.)
Furthermore, they barely
addressed social problems such

as racism, institutionalized_

poverty and crime. They said
absolutely nothing about cor-

porate greed. They probably,

couldn’t have without cutting
their own throats politically, as
they sold out to the business-
oriented Republican Party.

On top of that, a number of
their bedfellows couldn’t meet
their own moral standards. Jim
Bakker, jimmy Swaggart and
former baseball player Steve
Garvey all compromised them-
selves sexually. Nancy Reagan
consulted astrologers. George
Bush and Dan Quayle suppos-
edly had affairs. '

The religious right often
claims that the secularmedia is
biased against religion or God.
So what do its owh media out-
lets do? Slant stories so that the

conservative viewpoint can. be

justified. I heard a Christian
radio talk-show host refer to a
story in USA Today, in which a

woman in the state of Indiana
filed suit against-the Federal
Communications Commission
to get graphic anti-abortion
campaign ads featuring dead
fetuses off the air. The host
failed to mention the woman in
question was opposed to abor-
tion. I heard a story on a
Christian radio station about a
then 16-year-old boy whose
custody was given to his
deceased father’s homosexual
lava‘ iﬁgtsaa 8fH1§ ‘*tHH8&%88I
talist Christian mother.” What
was left out was that the judge
asked the boy whom he want-
ed to be with, and he chose
the gay man.

Finally, the religious right all,

but ignores whom it says is the
central figure of its faith —
Jesus Christ himself. He’didn’t
come to promote -morals for
their own sake, but to
announce the advent of a new

‘ kingdorn. His primary purpose

was to bring redemption to a

-fallen world by reconciling it to

God, through his death on a
Roman cross. You won’t hear
much about the cross from -the
religious right because its own
thinking would have to change.
It’s power hungry. Religion is
based on a set of moral
absolutes. Politics, especially in
a democracy such as ours, has
none. You do what you need

-to do to get elected, even if it
jmeans embracing positions you

find distasteful, and here is
where the religious right runs
into trouble. As quickly as its
candidates could belelected,
they could be (and were) just
asquickly voted out.

A number of years ago, evan-
gelist Billy Graham told Jerry
Falwell to shut up, and I

respect Dr. Graham for that. He S

sawthe problem wasn’t so
much God "inﬂuencing politics
but politics defining God. And
that’s the problem with the reli-
gious right. Its loyalists don’t
really know the God they claim
to worship and serve.

McCullough overcomes benching,

Panthers ride 22-point, halftime cushion to third conference road victory of season

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Give Pitt men’s basketball
head coach Paul Evans some
credit — he has guts. A Panther
team (10-4, 5-2 in the Big East)
without Jerry McCullough this
season is a scary prospect, but
Evans benched the point guard
for the first 6:24 of Saturday
night’s game at Villanova (6-7,
2-4).

With Ahmad Shareef at the
point and—Eric Mobley dominat-

ing inside, Pitt built a 16-4 lead V

by the time McCullough entered
the contest.

Mobley struggled the rest of
the way with foul trouble, but
McCullough took charge at that
point as the Panthers dominated
the first half 42-20 on the way to
a 81-70 Big East Conference vic-
tory at the DuPont Pavillion in
Philadelphia.

Overall, McCullough respond-
ed strongly to the benching

with 23 points, six rebounds, '

five assists and a key play every
time Villanova made a run at
Pitt’s lead.

“He is either very good or
very bad,” "Evans said of

McCullough. “He was very_

good, for the. most part,
tonight.”

Pitt took control on the inside
game during the 16-4 run. Chris
Gant and Mobley not only con-
trolled the boards and scored,
they passed well. Gant found
Mobley driving the lane for a
slam to make it 10-4. Mobley
returned the favor moments
later. i “

With the lead
McCullough took over the
offense. He sandwiched four
free throws around a three-
point shot, and set up a Jaime
Peterson trip to the free throw
line with a steal and pass.
Despite the late start,
McCullough had nine points at
the half. ,

Even after McCullough’s
return, it was the inside game
that put the Panthers in com-
mand in the first half. Pitt scored

All the Pitt women’s basketball team

new winning streak.

One game does not a streak make,

but it has to start somewhere.

That somewhere was a 73-59 Pitt
victory over St. John’s on Saturday.
Now the Lady Panthers, winners of
seven of their last eight, can talk about
continuing their one-game streak.

ﬁeld in the first half. Two three-
point shots from Kerry Kittles,
who scored 10 points in the
half, were the only real offen-
sive spark for Villanova.

Kittles sparked the Wildcats
as they rediscovered their
offense in_the second half of
play and ‘made arun at the
Panthers.

“[A lead is tenuous] with "a
team like this, which has three
or four guys who can, fire up
threes,” Evans said. “When you

ing them up with no pressure

Pitt ended the run with an
inside score by ‘ Orlando
Antigua, who had a solid game
with 14 points.

“He took the ball inside pretty
well tonight, which got him
some confidence,” Evans said.
“Then he hit a few jump shots.
He’s been consistent.”

McCullough stole a pass on
the next possession and drew a
foul. The two free, throws raised
the lead back to 16. The
Wildcats hit three treys, the last
two by point guard Jonathan
Haynes, but McCullough

 

 

’Cats, 81 - 70

answered the last two of them
with his own shots from beyond
the arc.

Villanova pulled close again, i

this time getting the lead down
to seven, thanks to a mistake by
Garrick Thomas. Haynes baited
the sophomore swingman and
Thomas shoved him, putting
Haynes at the line. His two foul
shots made the score 70-65.

Haynes returned the favor
with an error in judgement of
his own. He reached in as Pitt
tried to inbound the ball and
was whistled for a technical
foul. .
McCullough hit one of the
two free throws, then set up
Shareef for another trip to the
charity stripe, in which he hit
one of two also. I _

Pitt held on behind four free
throws by Gant, who scored 12
in the contest, including six-of-
six foul shooting, and grabbed a
game-high 12 rebounds.

"‘I think he’s back where he
was at the beginning of the sea-
son,” Evans said.

The 10—4 Georgetown Hoyas, ‘

Pitt’s opponent tonight at the
Civic Arena, were not back to
where they were whenthey

played last Saturday. DePaul
pounded the Hoyas 78-51,

which may help Pitt’s confi- -

dence. .
“Sometimes I think our kids

are afraid of Georgetown,” 4

Evans said.
“You want to tell [the Pitt

‘ players], they are not as good as

they have been in the past. At
the same time, you don’t want
them to think it is going to be
too easy.” ’ .

Evans’ plan for the Hoyas is

_similar to what many teams

have done to the Panthers this
season.

“We’re going, to play some
zone and make them shoot the
ball,” Evans said. ,_

“I don’t think they are a real
good perimeter team. If we can
play zone and keep them from
getting second chance shots,
we’ll be in pretty good shape.”

PSU drowns women's swim by 69

By, Brady Slater .
Staff Writer

Back on Nov. 11 when the .

Pitt women’s swimming and
diving team beat Miami, they
were able to take advantage of
their deeper lineup against a tal-
much smaller
Hurricane team;

But Pitt’s loss the following

week at Virginia and a third—'

place finish at the Pitt
Invitational proved just how
small the Miamiteam was.

On Saturday, the outnum-
bered Panthers (4—3) lost to
Penn State 183-114.

“It was a tough day,” said
senior captain Jennifer Burns.

“Penn State just had so much

depth in every event.”

The tough day started when
Penn St. opened the meet by
sweeping the top three spots in
the 200—yard medley relay. But
that start was something the Pitt
women said they expected.

“We knew going in that we

» weren’t going to win,” junior

Vicki Geubtner said. “We just
wanted to go for best times
against good competition.”

And some of the swimmers
were going for best times in
events that they weren’t really
used to swimming. Since the
Panthers’ weren’t expecting to
win the meet, head coach
Marian Cassidy juggled the Pitt
hneup. .

“Because we are a small team,
we sometimes get frustrated
swimming the same events all
the time,” Geubtner said. “It was
nice to be able to mix it up.”

One of the swimmers who
took advantage of swimming in
a different event was junior
Christy Knobloch. Knobloch,
normally a backstroker, won the
100—meter butterﬂy with a time
of 1:00.40. She also placed sec-
ond in the 100-meter back-
stroke.

Knobloch’s performance is
more impressive considering
she missed last week’s
Cleveland St. meet due to a her-
niated disk in her back.

“It was nice to do something
different,” she said.

“My back felt pretty good.
There was a little bit of pain, but
nothing I wasn’t going to swim
through.”

The best swimming event of
the day for the Panthers came in
an event that the swimmers
were used to. Sophomore but-
terflyer Jenny Doran beat sec-
ond place finisher, rookie
Charla Caponi, in the 200-meter

. butterfly. Doran swam a 2:09.35,

and Caponi swam a 2:11.22.

“The closest Penn St. finisher

swam a 2:14.62.

While the swimmers were
overmatched, the Pitt divers
continued their year—long suc-
cess. — Sophomore Sunday
Lewandowski won the 1-meter
and 3-meter diving, and Pitt
junior Kara Sixbury placed sec-
ond in both of those events.

Pitt (12-3, 6-1 in the Big

tied for first place in the Big

Hall (6-1) and Providence (6-

A hanging-in-the-lane
jumper by Jonna Huemrich
at the 19:10 mark of the sec-
ond half gave the Lady
Panthers the lead, 33-32, that

Morton said.

“A lot of our points came from transi-
tion into the break instead of having to
rely on the offense,” Joyce said.

The Lady Panther bench assisted in
keeping the run going as sophomore
T ressa Bolfert, who scored 10 points on
four-of-five shooting, hit layups on
three consecutive Panther offensive
possessions.

“That’s the best game Tressa has
played. She really contributed today,”
Joyce said.

Bolfert, who played 10 minutes in
the contest, saw her playing time
increased Saturday because reserve for-
ward Missy Thompson sprained her left
ankle in practice and did not dress for
the game.

Bolfert came through.

“Maybe in the back of her head she
knew that we really needed her in
there. She just took it to them,” Morton
said.

“Tressa did a nice job in there,”
Bruce said.

“Tressa doesn’t get those 10 points,
we do_n’t win the game.”

Two baskets by Huemrich, one by
Joyce and six free throws later, Pitt led
by 17 points at the 10:00 mark.

More important than what the Lady
Panthers did on offense is what St.
John’s wasn’t able to do. St. John’s
couldn’t keep pace and the Lady
Panther defense kept the Express’ top
two scorers from being that much of a
factor.

Pam Odom, who averages 15.2
points, -and Grace Kelly, 13.7, were
held to only one basket and two free
throws combined in the first 14 minutes
of the second half.

“That was a key here,” Bruce said. “If
you look at the shooting percentages
when they had to have a basket or
when it was critical, we might have
shut them down all together.”

When Pitt was in a man-to-man
defense, it was Joyce’s job to stiﬂe

Odom —— who scored only 12 points.

“lOdom’sl tough and she likes to take
the ball to the basket, but I felt like I
did okay on her,” Joyce said.

Joyce managed a little offense as
well, scoring 16 points in addition to
grabbing eight rebounds. But despite
the scoring prowess of Huernrich and
Joyce, Morton literally stole the game
out from under the Express.

Morton put merely five points on the
board, but racked up 10 assists and five
steals while turning the ball over only
once. Morton, who seemedto be
everywhere on the court at once, didn’t
think this was her best game of the sea-
son.

“No. Maybe on paper, but I didn’t
feel like I was doing anything extra
special,” Morton said.

The Lady Panthers struggled with the
Express in the first half, needing two
Erin Maloy free throws to take a 31-30
lead into intermission.

St. John’s suffered a decisive setback
at the 9:09 mark of the first half when

starting junior point guard Marcia Price
was lost for the season with a broken
arm.

Price had stolen the ball off of
Morton and was attempting a layup at
full speed. Morton slapped at the ball,
and Price never got a shot off. Price’s
momentum carried her headlong into
the basket support and broke her left
am.

“That’s the worst thing that could
ever happen,” Morton said. “That was
in my head the whole game.

“I saw her coming down and I knew
I could touch the ball. I didn’t intend to
foul her. I don’t even think I did per-
sonally, but I hit the ball and backed
off. She kept going into the thing, and
her hand twisted right around. It was
awful. I just hope she’s all right.

“I’m really sorry that I had anything
to do with it. That is going to be on my
mind for the rest of the season.”

Price was wheeled out on a stretcher
and taken to Presbyterian University
Hospital for treatment.
