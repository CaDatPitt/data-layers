Casey stable after dual-trans plant

Pa. Governor resting following 13-hour heart—liver surgery

Governor Robert ‘P. Casey has a 90 percent chance of
surviving the first year after his double heart-liver trans-
plant, according to Dr. John Fung, chief of transplanta-
tion and associate professor of surgery at the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

He is listed in critical but stable condition, which is
normal for people who have undergone double trans-
plant surgery, according to UPMC spokesperson Jane

Duffield.

“Were gratified with his response — the factthat he
has awoken and that his heart and liver function,” Fung
said. “He is communicating with his family with a
notepad; he can write and make expressions.”

According to UPMC cardiologist Dr. William
Follansbee, Casey was in good spirits last night and
gave him the high five after he finished examining him.

Doctors said they are pleased with Casey’s reaction to
the surgery and his condition and his responsiveness
when he awoke at 3:00 a.m. Tuesday.

“His heart was in terrible condition,” UPMC cardio-
thoracic surgeon Dr. John Armitage said. “The gover-
nor’s life was in immediate danger. There’s no question

about that.”

UPMC pathologist Dr. Anthony Demetrius said he
could not believe that Governor Casey was able to
function as well as he did and keep up with his hectic
schedule despite his damaged heart. _

Affer doctors completed a heart and liver transplanta-
tion into Casey at Presbyterian-University Hospital,
Demetrius was able to examine both organs and found
Casey’s heart to be twice the size of a normal heart.

“His heart was 700 grams —— twice the normal weight
of 500-550 grams,” Demetrius said. “In pathology, we
don’t often see the patients, they’re usually dead.

Caliguiri, Casey

Disease which fell

rare in occurrence

The same fatal disease that took former
Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri’s life was

within weeks of doing the same to
Pennsylvania Governor Robert P. Casey.

Amyloidosis, a progressive disease that
destroys body organs by generating surplus
proteins that other organs in the body cannot
absorb, is what necessitated Casey’s sudden
double-transplant operation.

After several tests to determine if the gover-
nor would be able to survive a liver transplant,
doctors "discovered his heart would not be able
to withstand the trauma and suggested the

Donor's family grieves loss, expresses anger over invasion of privacy

By Brian Gallagher
Sports Editor

Propped behind a sea of recorders and
microphones, Frances and Yvonne Lucas
held hands.

Facing the state media for the first and
likely only time since it was revealed that
their youngest family member -—— the late
William Michael Lucas —— was the donor
of both heart and liver to Pennsylvania
Governor Robert Casey, mother and
daughter clasped their respective left and
right hands as a show of strength and
solidarity.

For their slain brother and son. For
themselves.

But when physical expressions were

replaced by those of a verbal nature —
when the press conference began and
stoic pictures were enhanced by sullen
sound — diametrically opposed feelings
of anger and sadness separated the
Lucas family as years divide a genera-
tion. *'

“I’m angry,” sister Yvonne said. “[My
brother is] dead, and you haven’t heard
anything why he’s dead.”

“I’m hurt  and I don’t— know how
long this will go on,” mother Frances
said.

Controlled rage and helpless frustra-
tion are but two emotions levied by the
Lucas family yesterday afternoon at the
Center for Organ Recovery and
Education in Blawnox. It was the kind of

reaction one would expect from two pri-
vate citizens who, in the midst of moum—
ing the death of the family’s youngest
member, went public in the interest of
regaining their privacy.

It seemed doubtful, however, that their

privacy would soon be recovered. After 1

all, when a deceased family member is
forever linked to the head of state gov-
ernment, emotional wounds are
reopened.

“I‘don’t think it should have been
done like this,” Yvonne Lucas said of the
wrenching circumstances. “It’s not some-
thing that should have been public.

“I understand that the governor is a
public figure, but we aren’t. And now
our privacy is invaded.”

Going public with the name of the
donor and family is not normal proce-
dure, according to CORE executive
director Brian Broznick. But after the
media broke the story, the family asked
CORE to call a press conference.

“This is not our policy to let the media
know, or anybody else know, who the
[donor] family is,” Broznick said.
“Unfortunately, that has been found.”

Broznick emphasized that yesterday’s
press conference was the only opportu-
nity for the media to speak with the
Lucas farﬁily.

“If the media persists to come to the
family’s house, the state police will come

Pitt needs to pay more atten-
tion to its staff members, Vice
Chancellor of Business and
Finance Ben Tuchi said.

“The broadest conclusion
clearly indicates that the
University of Pittsburgh needs to
pay more attention to its most
valuable asset — staff employ-
ees. There are steps needed to
make Human Resources function
better. One of the points was that
the number of staff devoted to
Human Resources management
functions was less than that of
overr80 comparable uni-versitiesf’
Tuchi said. ,

Pitt’s Human Resources depart-
ment and various University
committees are analyzing a con-
sulting firm report on Human
Resources. A report will be avail-
able to the university community
within several weeks, according
to Tuchi. '

The report also analyzed pay
scales, but Tuchi said that Pitt
was already doing so. Ray
Fortunato and Associates, the

consulting firm comprised of
Human Resources administrators
at universities throughout the
country, took a week to do the
report, Tuchi said.

At a Staff Association Council
meeting on June 9, SAC President
Joanne Rosol said that changes in
Human Resources “are an ongo-
ing area. We need more [staffing]
at Human Resources. There is a
major overhaul going on [at
Human Resourcesl.”

SAC is working closely with
Human Resources on issues such
as transfers, classiﬁcation systems
and performance appraisals,
according to Rosol.

Another benefit being studied
is making personal leave avail-
able not just to the employee, but
to care for a spouse or relative.
“We are waiting for a response
from Hartford [Insurance Co.],”
SAC benefits committee Chair
Steve Zupcic said.

“In a time of ﬁscal constraint,
faculty and staff are working
together to save and to cut costs,
but not to denigrate current
health insurance,” Zupcic said.
He also discussed looking at

Same-sex partners of Pitt
employees will receive benefits
such as education, university ID
cards and services, and bereave-
ment leave, Zupcic said.

“The main purpose is to bring
the university benefits package in
line with the university non-dis-
crimination policy,” Zupcic said.

The new beneﬁts start July 1.
Extension of benefits to oppo-
site-sex partners is still being
studied.

“Benefits for opposite-sex part-
ners were part of the original
proposal. I don’t know the cur-
rent status of extending benefits
to opposite-sex partners. In the
original proposal, the cost for all
domestic partners under the
whole plan would be less than
$10,000. So the final cost will be
well under $10,000 per year for
the whole university. The finan-
cial impact will be very small,”
Zupcic said.

The biggest benefit would be
tuition remission equivalent to
that for spouses of faculty and
staff. With a maximum of six

credits per term or 12 credits per
year, a person in a degree pro-
gram pays $5 per credit.

Using census figures, Zupcic
said that based on the percentage
of unmarried domestic partners
in the Pittsburgh metropolitan
area, 7% of Pitt employees would
have domestic partners, of either
sex Because only one out of 30
married couples at Pitt currently
use the tuition-remission pro-
gram, well under 10 people per
year would use the tuition-rernis-
sion beneﬁt, according to Zupcic.

Even though the tuition is very,

low, people using the tuition-
remission benefit “fill otherwise
unoccupied seats. It also brings
money in through use of the
bookstore, catering, and other
things,” Zupcic said.

-SAC will sponsor an open pub-
lic meeting for Pitt staff on July 8
at the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room to discuss
changes in Human Resources,
parking and transportation prob-
lems and the budget. There will
most likely be video or audio
linkups to regional campuses,
according to Rosol.

Pitt student groups forced into conﬂict, says CWO

By Julie Sabol
Editor in Chief

Pitt’s Campus Women’s Organization
worked hard to build a strong and mutu-
ally beneficial relationship with the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance,
according to CWO co-president Shira
Hassan. .

They also worked to obtain office
space within the university.

But when the university offered them
BiGALA’s second office, what CWO got
was a conﬂict between an office and a
positive relationship with another uni-
versity organization, Hassan said.

“The administration is aware of how
strong both of the groups had become
and I think that really scared them. I
think they want‘to put the two groups
against one another in an effort to weak-
en them by putting us both in a corner,”
Hassan said.

Hassan believes that the university
wanted to diminish the power of the two
groups.

“I seriously do think it was because
they [the administration] wanted to seri-
ously weaken the two groups,” Hassan
said.

According to Director of Student
Activities Joe Cavalla, the university had

no intention of causing trouble between .

the two groups. ‘

"No one is conspiring against any-
body. Everybody wants space and all
options were looked at; no one should
be jumping up and down about conspir-
acy. No one is trying to break up any
relationships,” he said.

BiGALA co-president Sacha Layos said
that the university may not have con-
spired against them, but that they didn’t
consider how the groups would be
affected.

“I wouldn’t say a conspiracy, but I
think they were presented with a situa-
tion and that this seemed like the easiest
solution for them,” Layos said.

Layos also said that the university took
advantage of both organizations because
they are under new leadership.

“The leadership of both of these orga-
nizations has been very active and very
visible in the past. Now [the administra-
tion} thinks that since the leadership has
changed, that this is an opportunity to
make us think we can’t fight for what we
need or what we want simply because
we don’t know the ins and outs of how
the administration works,” Layos said.

Cavalla said he has worked with both
organizations, but another office is not
available.

“Space is tight. There are many people
waiting in line for office space,” Cavalla
said.

Cavalla and union manager Chris
Chergi searched the building for any
empty space that would be suitable for
the organization but none — other than
the BiGALA office — was found, Cavalla
said.

“At this time, this is the best possible
solution. I gave CWO an option. I felt it
would be a good office to have  I
wasn’t trying to hurt BiGALA. It’s a inat-
ter of space crunch,” Cavalla said.

Same—seX partners awarded benefits

Cavalla said he has always been sup-
portive of both organizations and said
they are both very valuable to the cam-
pus.

Other options were looked into but
Cavalla said he felt this was the only
solution.

“When we approached this and we
originally asked for space, we specifical-
ly said we did not want to take space
from BiGALA or the Black Action Society
because we knew those would be the
groups most threatened by our proposal
for an office," Hassan said.

Cavalla says that the decision was not
made to be detrimental to any organiza-
tion. I

“I’m trying to help an organization
where I can, not hurt another one. I
didn’t think I was hurting BiGALA."
Cavalla said. “This thing’s blowing up a
little bit and it shouldn’t.’’

Layos said the decision could result in

a negative effect on the relationship
between CWO and BiGALA.

Tuition cap promises

I Byjack Finn

Asst. News Editor

Pitt faculty, staff and administration
involved in same-sex relationships who regis-
ter as domestic partners will be awarded in-
house benefits beginning July 1 similar to
those provided to married personnel.

The benefits will include tuition remission,
bereavement leave and such courtesy benefits
as library cards and Pitt ID cards. Health insur-
ance beneﬁts will not be included.

The policy is in response to a proposal rec-
ommended by the University Senate and Staff
Association Council close to six months ago.
The original proposal asked to cover domestic
partners of both the same and opposite sex,
but Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
approved the proposal for same-sex partners
only.

“The proposal for opposite—sex partners to
receive these benefits is still before the chan-
cellor,” University Senate Council President
James Holland said. “A letter to this effect has
been sent to O’Connor, but we haven’t
received a response as yet.”

To qualify as a domestic partnership, Pitt
employees must sign an affidavit attesting to
specific facts that demonstrate they are in a
cohabitating, mutually caring, committed,
financially interdependent and unmarried
domestic partnership that has been in exis-
tence for at least two years. ,

“Financial interdependence would be
demonstrated by joint ownership of property,

joint credit, joint savings or checking or being
listed as a beneficiary on the other’s life—insur-

‘ ance policy,” Holland said.

“This new benefits policy for domestic part-
nerships acknowledges the diversity within the
university,” Vice Chancellor for Institutional
Advancement Lawrence M. “Weber said.

Original cost estimates were in the $10,000
to $12,000 range, according to Holland.

These figures were for both same sex and
opposite sex partners. There are no figures
available for same sex partners only, Holland
said.

But Pitt may run into future problems due to
a city ordinance prohibiting discrimination
based on sexual orientation since the policy
does not allow for opposite—sex couples to
apply for domestic—partnership status.

Sofronia Harris, executive director of
Pittsburgh’s Commission on Human Relations,
has not reviewed Pitt’s policy yet. She said she
is in the process of gathering the necessary
information to present to the commission in
August. _

“From the limited information I have, it [Pitt’s
domestic—partnership policy] appears to violate
our codes,” Harris said.

“Sexual orientation has never been recog-
nized by the Supreme Court as a legitimate
claim for equal protection or due process,” Pitt
law professor Susan Key said. “They recognize
sex and race, but not orientation.”

Opposite—sex partners have an opportunity

‘to marry, but under state law same sex part-

ners do not have that right, according to Key.

extra money for Pitt

The Pitt News

Pitt could receive an additional
$42 million in state funds if the

university holds tuition increases‘

to 4.5 percent.

Pitt assistant director of com-
monwealth relations Ann
Dykstra said, “My understanding
is that [Pitt is] planning to hold
the increases.”

Pitt has already been allocated
$135,085,000 in funding under
the state budget for the fiscal
year beginning July 1, which is
$12,000 more than last year’s
budget.

Funds for recruitment and
retention of. disadvantaged stu-
dents are the only line item that
was increased, according to

Dykstra. The budget, passed May
28, breaks down as follows: _
°$119,514,000 for educational
and general expenses.
°$312,000 for the recruitment
and retention of disadvantaged
students.

°$6,259,000 for the School of
Medicine.

‘$7,693,000 for Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.

°$497,000 for \VPIC’s suicide
prevention center.

‘$1,030,000 for the dental clin-
ic.

The $4.2 million is considered
a "tuition challenge grant” which
is an incentive for the state’s uni-
versities to keep tuition increases
below 4.5 percent.“The initial

posed that every institution

SGB plans for gazebo on the Union lawn

By Jack Finn

Asst. News Editor

The William Pitt Union will
have a new look for the fall
semester, according to Student
Government Board President
Jacob Brody.

Brody announced the plans
for a gazebo/bandstand and a
four-sided clock to be erected
on the. union lawn at its board
meeting held last Saturday.

The gazebo/bandstand is
expected to be between 35 and
40 feet in diameter and will cost
approximately S-”i5,(l()(), accord-
ing to Brody. “It will be used for
student groups. speeches, plays,
lectures and as a place for stu-
dents to just relax." Brody said.

be similar to the clock that is at
Carnegie Mellon University. “It
will enhance the appearance of
the union, and will help stu-
dents get to class on time,”
Brody added.

Funding for the two projects
will be paid for by the universi-
ty. for the most part, with a
small portion coming from SGB
funds, according to Brody.

The project has been turned
over to the Office of Facilities
Management for evaluation and
cost estimates. but has received
preliminary approval from uni-
versity officials, he said.

‘Brody also addressed the
recent request by the Graduate
and Professional Student,
Association to raise its activity

which would make the graduate
student fee $10, is still under
consideration.

GPSA would like to earmark
the additional funds for specific
programs benefitting GPSA.

Although the Senate Council
endorsed the $3 increase at its
meeting last week, Brody said
he still has concerns with the
fee. '

Brody said he felt that a con-
flict may arise if organizations
were allowed to increase fees
without sharing those increases.

where the undergraduate stu-
dent body is paying a larger
share of activities fees for vari-

Gays, lesbians, bisexuals celebrate the family

By Lauren Corcoran
For The Pitt News

Gays, lesbians and bisexuals will be
reclaiming the word “family” all next week
throughout Pittsburgh’s Pride Week cele-
brations.

Beginning on June 18 and running
through June 27, the gay, lesbian and bisex-
ual community is ce.lebrating Pride Week.

“lPride Week is} a memorial celebration of
the Stonewall Riots in New York City in
1969. It is the anniversary of the riots," Pride
Week co-Chairjoe Klements said.

The theme of this year’s Pride Week is “A
Family of Pride.” The choosing of this
theme was “done as a result of the rhetoric
of the presidential campaign  to reclaim
the word family,” Klements said.

Gays and lesbians were excluded from
the word family, supposedly because,
"They did not belong in families," according

I to Klements.

“The theme is chosen by consensus. The
consensus this year was to reclaim the idea
of family from groups on the right who
believe they are the only ones with fami-
lies,” Pride Week co-Chair Elizabeth French
said.

“When it comes right down to it we are
like everyone else  It’s not fair that this
would happen to my family just because of
who I am," French said.

Pride Week will include workshops, reli-
gious celebrations, plays, music and a
parade and rally.

“I would like to invite people to attend
various events of the week, and, also, to
pick up a Pride Guide not only at gay busi-
nesses but also gay-friendly businesses,”
Klements said.

Members of the Pride Week committee
said the festivities are not only for gays, les-
bians or bisexuals.

“Come regardless of whether you’re gay
or not. Please come and join what should

be an enjoyable day,” French said.

», Pride Week concludes with the Pittsburgh
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Pride Parade
which will end in a rally at Point State Park.
Klements said he expects to see more than
2,000 people there this year as compared to
last year’s 1,500.

French said she believes that the parade
and rally, and Pride Week in general, will
“give people common ground to discuss
things and not be divisive."

Highlights of scheduled events include:

United
Nations
air strikes

provoke
CMU rally

By John Brouder

For The Pitt News

Students and community
members rallied at
Carnegie Mellon
University’s campus
Monday to protest the
United Nations air strikes
on Somalia.

“Politicians feel we’re
supposed to become used
to these repetitive attacks.
We shouldn’t,''’ protester
Vincent Eirene said.

Eirene said the United
States provided weapons
to Third World and Middle
East countries during the
80s, which made the prob-
lem worse. “It’s the equiva-
lent to arming gangs in
New York City and being
surprised they're figliting.”

Tatsu Ikeda, who has
been doing peace work
for two years, said he was
shocked about the situa-
tion in Somalia. "We’ve
expected Bosnia to be
bombed, but not Somalia.
It’s hard to believe this
started out as a humanitari-
an mission,” he said.

Ikeda compared the
Somalia situation to the
disaster in Waco, Texas.
“It’s just like Waco, when
you mass a lot of forces on
a single place, it’s going to
blow up."

Eirene said many differ-
ent types of people were
at the protest.

Reverend Willy Ludlow
of the Community of
Reconciliation protested
during college against the
Korean War. He said his
basic philosophy is that
“the country hasn’t
changed. Instead of find-
ing jobs for the military.
we should find jobs for
people."

remove anybody from the family grounds,”
Broznick said.

The ordeal of the Lucas family began
June 6 around 8 p.m. That's when Michael
Lucas, 34, was beaten over the head in a
possible gang-related incident outside his
mother's home. After a week in the inten-
sive care unit at Allegheny General
Hospital, Lucas was declared brain dead
Sunday evening.

The family consented to the transplanta-
tion of Lucas’ heart and liver — as well as
his kidneys to two other recipients — 11
p.m. Sunday.

While much had been made of the trans-
plants to Casey, the family said the murder
of Michael Lucas has been overshadowed.

“I feel like the only investigation being
done has been done by me  and my
family," Yvonne Lucas said.

“Right now, my main concern is who did
this to my brother. Because if that wouldn’t
have happened, we wouldn’t be talking
about organs —— he’d have his organs and
we’d be home. And we would be normal
like We were.

“If there's anything that they know, we’d

like them to come forth so that we can
have these people [that killed Lucasl put
where they need to be put  and let my
brother rest in peace.

“We're not going to be at peace unless
we find the people who did this. And
they’re out there running around and they
can do this to somebody else. Who says
they’re not going to [kill] the rest of us,"
she said.

Even if and when justice is served, the
memory of Yvonne’s brother’s life, and
what he gave in death, will forever remain.

“I wish him and his family the best,”
Yvonne Lucas said. “We’ll go on and hope-
fully they’ll go on. They’ll keep him  and
we’ll just have our memories.”

For Michael Lucas’ mother, who has now
lost two sons (Eugene, 21, was shot to
death in 1972) to violent deaths, the image
of her youngest remains.

“He was a very warm person,” Frances
Lucas said. “Loved to dance, sing, tease
kids. It helps me [deal with Lucas’ death] to
know that somebody else is living from my
Michael.

“Someday I would like to speak with
[Casey], but I’m having a hard time now.”

"It could possibly be very detri-
mental because they specifically did
not want to take any space from us.
If that happens it probably won‘t be
understood or accepted by most
members of both groups," Layos
said.

Hassan said that CWO is faced
with a difficult decision.

“CWO is in a position at this point
{that} if we don't accept it we’ll have

Layos also said it is necessary for
BiGALA to have the extra space.

“It’s not necessarily a question of
two offices, it’s a question of space
because our organization serves
more than one purpose and we're
reaching out to people who might

be afraid to get involved with a
group that is highly political. We
need to let them know were here
for them personally," Layos said.

Cavalla said the group is free to
turn down the space, but he cannot
guarantee he will be able to find an
alternative.

"The administration is trying to
say that there is no space in the
union. However, I think that if they
did a comprehensive survey on
what space is being used and being
used wisely they would find that
there is plenty of available office
space for those groups that are will-
ing to fight to get them,” Layos said.

“I feel that what [the administra-
tion} did was attempt to pacify us,
not satisfy us." Hassan said.

Transplant

Continued from page 1
Sometimes when there is a par-
ticularly striking case, we won-
der how a patient was able to
function with this diseased
organ —— this was one such
case.”

According to the transplant
team surgeons, the surgery,
which began 7:30 a.m. and
ended 8:45 p.m. on Monday,
went well and was without
complications. A

“The procedure was flawless,"
said Fung “The next 48 hours
will give us a better idea of
heart and liver complications.”

The governor, who did expe-
rience some bleeding during the
operation, was placed on the
experimental drug FK5()6,
which is used to prevent the
body from rejecting the new
organs.

“[FK5()6l dramatically
enhances our success in trans-

plants,” Fung said.

After the double transplant,
Casey was moved to the cardio-
thoracic intensive-care unit
where he will stay until the doc-
tors are satisﬁed that his heart is
in stable condition.

According to Follansbee,
Casey’s new heart is performing
very well. His blood pressure
was stable Monday night.

Casey, 61, entered PUH on
Saturday in hopes of a new liver
to cure familial amyloidosis, a
progressive disease that plagues
body organs by generating sur-
plus proteins that cannot be
absorbed.

After several tests to deter-‘

mine whether or not he would
be able to have a liver trans-
plant, surgeons determined that
the governors heart was too
weak to undergo the liver trans-
plant, and suggested the dan-
gerous two—organ transplant.

Fung said that the advances in
the medical field —— particularly
in drug improvements — is the
main reason why he and the
team of doctors are so conﬁdent
about Casey’s chances of sur-
vival. _

Prior to surgery, Casey signed
a declaration of disability tem-
porarily transferring the powers
of his office to Lieutenant
Governor Mark Singel 5:00 a.m.
yesterday.

Singel lived up to his role as
acting governor by signing two
bills into law —— a first in the his-
tory of Pennsylvania.According
to a statement issued from the
Office of the Governor, Singel
signed House Bill 65, which
amends the state Sunshine Law
to require the local governing
bodies to set aside time at regu-
lar or special meetings to
receive comments from the
public who are in attendance.

risky operation that would replace both his organs.

The Appalachian variant of amyloidosis — or familial amy-
loidosis — is a genetic disorder caused by the liver’s abnor-
mal production of the protein transthyretin.

According to Pitt associate professor of medicine Dr.
William Calhoun, the liver transplant would be necessary in
order to regulate the production of the proteins.

“One of the kinds of amyloidosis can affect the liver, and
so the liver cannot break them down. They then collect in
other organs such as the heart, lungs or kidneys,” he said.
“With the liver’s inability to metabolize the proteins, they
must put in a new liver.”

Transthyretin is commonly deposited in nerves, the small
intestine and the heart muscle. ‘Casey suffers from this form
of the disease which usually occurs later in life than other
forms of inherited amyloidosis.

Recent studies in Sweden, Spain and the United States indi-
cate that liver transplants are an effective treatment for inher-
ited forms of amyloidosis.

Since 1990, 15 patients with amyloidosis have undergone
liver transplants. Fourteen of them are still living and pro-
gression of the disease has been halted.

Presbyterian-University Hospital has performed four heart-
liver transplants. Two heart-liver transplant patients died
shortly after the operation in 1985. The third received a heart,
liver and lung and died four months after the operation. The
fourth, Stormie Jones, was the longest survivor of such a
transplant operation. She received her new heart and liver in
February 1984 and lived until November 1990.

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 16, 1993  

Donors should not be forgotten

One is a 61-year old white man, the other a 34-year old
African-American man. One is in a position of authority,
the other was unemployed and from Monessen, a once-
productive steel town in Monongahela Valley. One is the
governor of Pennsylvania, and the other was a victim of a
gang-related beating.

On June 6, Governor Casey’s organ donor, identiﬁed as
William Michael Lucas, was beaten outside of his home in
Monongahela Valley, and died of head wounds one _week
later at Allegheny General Hospital. According to
Monessen Police Chief John Bachinski, “gang members
from Pittsburgh” were blamed for the attack. No arrests
have been made.

In 1986, Governor Casey visited Monessen during his

-campaign, promising to help the economically depressed

town hit hard by the decline in the steel industry.
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, “Casey had
promised  that the economically depressed Mon Valley
would be the first spot he visited if he were elected. The
morning after the election, the "governor-elect toured Lucas’
home area.” He said that his administration would try to
help revitalize the once—booming economy. ,

But Lucas lived in a town where violent crime took his
brother’s life and eventually his own. These tragic events
would have undoubtedly gone unnoticed by the public if
Lucas had not been the donor for Casey’s transplant.
Suddenly Lucas and his family were thrust under the spot-
light and into the media. Rarely is donor-recipient inforrna-
tion ever given.

“It is not our policy to let the media know, or anyone else
know, who [the donor’s] family is. Unfortunately, that has
been found,” said Brian Broznick, executive director of the
Center for Organ Recovery and Education. But in this case,
the name of the donor has become public information. It’s
not fair that the family had to be put in such a position. To
be on display and subject to personal questions seems
cruel, especially in light of the fact that Lucas’ death would
have been overlooked if it were not for his organ compati-
bility. »

When Casey entered the hospital, the media swarmed to
obtain information. But few knew about another man, a
less powerful man who was also dying.

Michael’s sister, Yvonne Lucas, said that Michael was the

second innocent victim of violence in her family. She also
said that her family has been left with not only grief but
also unanswered questions about why her brother’s death
has not been solved. The signiﬁcance of this organ trans-
plant highlights the difference between the two men
involved. One is a nationally known public figure; the
other is a private citizen. One is left wondering if the death
of William Lucas would be as significant if he were not the
donor, but just an average man whose life was violently
ended.

Queers want rights not privileges 

Over a month has passed since masses of peo-
ple gathered in Washington, D.C. to support gay,
lesbian and bisexual equal rights and liberation.
Now, Gay, Lesbian’ and Bisexual Pride Week is
set to kick off June 19 right here in Pittsburgh and
end with a march through downtown on June 26.
I attended the March on Washington, and now I
look forward to attending the Pride festivities
again.

I am often faced with questions from others (as
well as myself) about why events such as Pride
festivities are necessary. The main reason is self
explanatory -— to celebrate the ‘

The federal government has yet to pass any
legislation that prohibits discrimination based on
sexual orientation.

It’s a good thing that Pittsburgh has its own
anti-discrimination policy based on sexual orien-
tation, because without it I could justifiably be
fired from my job because someone read this arti-
cle and identified me as gay. I could also be pro-

hibited from taking classes, riding a bus or living l‘
in my apartment for no other reason than I enjoy 

kissing boys.
In Colorado this past November, voters passed
Amendment 2, which outlaws

pride we have in being queer.
It’s hard sometimes to be happy
with who you are when others
stigmatize you.

Pride Day allows us to join

Adam N ovak

the passage of state or municipal
civil-rights protection based on
sexual orientation.

What this means is that in
Colorado, no one can even try to

with other queers and remem-
ber that we are not alone in our everyday battle
against homophobia.

In 1969, New York police raided a gay bar in
Greenwich Village called the Stonewall Inn. This

was not uncommon. What was uncommon was‘

the backlash that occurred.

A crowd comprised mostly of bull dykes and
drag queens decided that they weren’t going to
take it anymore. Instead of going along with the
police, the queers fought back and began a riot
that would last three days. Many credit the
“Stonewall Riots” as the beginning of the modern
day lesbian and gay civil rights movement.

Some want queers to shut up and stop asking
for what they call “special privileges”. This simply
shows their ignorance about what we are asking
for. The govemment’s stance on gays in the mili-
tary is a hot issue for the media, but less familiar
issues are just as important.

For example, there is not one gay or lesbian
couple in America that have been granted joint
custody of an adoptive child, even though recent
studies show that children who grow up with les-
bian or gay parents are just as healthy and adjust-
ed as children who are raised by heterosexual
parents.

Also, queers are no longer allowed to have a
Pride Day Picnic at Kehnywood Park. According
to the Pittsburgh Pride Guide, Harry Henninger,
president of Kennywood, has stated that same-
sex hugging, kissing and hand holding are “orga-

' nized political displays.”

Kennywood has a policy prohibiting any overt-

I 1y political function. The last time that I went to

Kennywood, I saw many heterosexual couples
holding hands and'making out throughout the
park. In fact, if I remember correctly, my father
and stepmother got a little romantic as the sun
was setting. Next time we go I’ll remember to
warn them about this policy so they’re not
banned from the park.

pass a similar bill to the one we
have in Pittsburgh. In other words, voters in
Colorado feel that one of the basic civil rights is
the right to act on your hatred.

Of course there are ways to get around anti-dis-
crimination policies that do exist. For example,
our own university decided against getting rid of
a group on campus which discriminates against
gays and lesbians.

As a gay student, this truly gave me faith in the
university (If you can’t tell that I’m being sarcas-
tic, then go ask ROTC how many queers are
receiving valuable money for college from this
program).

If you truly feel that queers should have no
civil rights, then you should talk to Allen
Schindler’s mother. Schindler was a twenty—'two-
year old gay man in the Navy who was beaten to
death by two shipmates. Interestingly enough, no
one is willing to say if the death was linked to
homophobia or not.

“Many people told me that I shouldn’t embar-
rass myself‘ by coming forward and saying that
my son was gay,” said Mrs. Schindler when she
spoke at the March on Washington. “I thought
about it, and I knew that anyone could say or do
anything to me but there’s one thing that you
can’t do. That’s touch my children.”

On June 26, I will be very proud to march in
the Pittsburgh Pride Parade along with the shirt-
less lesbians and drag queens. But, I will also be
surrounded by students, teachers, doctors, moth-
ers, fathers, people of color, people of different
abilities, as well as many others.

A few years ago I would have cringed at the

thought of appearing in public as a gay man. But

now, I am ready to jump at the chance. Even
though not all of us share the same ideologies,
beliefs or values we can still be happy to show
our pride in who we are. And that’s one civil right
that everyone should have.

‘Swing low’ presents

"Swing low, sweet in the
mornin'" is a creative produc-
tion of an escape from slavery
in the South to freedom in the
North. shown through the eyes
of Harriet Tubman.

What's enlightening is that it
is based on an actual journey
through Pittsburgh to get to a
boat that touched the three
rivers to take the slaves North to
Canada.

A production of The African
Drum and Dance Ensemble,
“Swing low," takes the viewer
into village life in Africa,
through the hard labor of work-
ing on plantations and into the
bushes on their road to free-
dom.

in the black-studies department
in community education,
research and development.

Sharif conceptualized “Swing
low" with Anthony Thompson
writing and directing the piece.

"Swing low" has already been
performed at the Three Rivers
Arts Festival and as the last part
of a three—part workshop. These
lecture/performances will take
place this week at three

But knowing a little about film budgets

shot on the now—famous figure of seven
thousand bucks, an amazing achievement.

What El Mariachi boils down to is a

Woodstra eyes major

returns from recruits

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

After an up-and-down regular
season, an inexperienced Pitt
volleyball team claimed its
usual place atop the Big East
last season.

“That was like a gift,” head
coach Sue Woodstra said. “For
starting three freshmen and giv-
ing four freshmen a lot of play-
ing time — I think winning the
Big East and getting to the
[NCAA] tournament was a bit of
a luxury. This year we want to
do something.”

While last year’s team had to

deal with the loss of six players

due to graduation, the Panthers
will return everybody for the
1993 season.

“I am very excited. I know
the girls are,” Woodstra said.
“It’s unique to have your entire
team and add some people.”

Those additions come in the
persons of Pitt’s lone recruit,
five-foot—eight—inch setter/out-
side hitter Laurie Fernandez
and transfer Lisa Nallepa.

Fernandez, who went" to St.
Thomas Moore Catholic High
School in Hamilton, Ontario, is
the latest product of Pitt’s
Canadian pipeline.

In addition to two-time Big
East Player of the Year Ann
Marie Lucanie, the Panthers
have also started Canadians
Dee MacAulay, Michele
Adamson and Heather Hollands
in recent years.

The latest in that tradition,
Fernandez, will provide depth
for the Panthers as an outside
‘hitter and a setter.

“We’ve needed depth at the
setter position ever since I’ve
been here [since 1989],”
Woodstra said.

Pitt’s two setters in
Woodstra’s tenure — former
Panther Jenelle Lantagne and
incumbent junior Annemarie
Mernagh —- have had to play
just about every point due to

the lack of a reserve setter.

Woodstra was a bithesitant
to expect a lot from the new-
comer.

“Laurie will be a little bit late
because she is participating on
the Canada Games team,”
Woodstra said.

“She’ll be coming into our
preseason practices a little late,
and I think that is going to
make it a little tougher for her
to work into the system.”

Nallepa, a sophomore who
transferred from Penn" State to
Pitt in January, may have an
easier time.

“Lisa practiced with us a little
bit in the spring so she’ll be a
little more comfortable coming
in,” Woodstra said.

In addition to the two new
players, the Panthers’ lineup
will also be bolstered by hav-
ing a healthy Jenny Driscoll.

The 5’11” middle hitter was
the most heavily recruited gem
in a prize Pitt recruiting class
last year, but had to sit out her
first season with a shoulder
injury.

Driscoll practiced in the
spring and should be ready for
the opening of preseason prac-
tice August 15.

“lThe shoulder] is doing pret-
ty well,” Woodstra said. “She’s
doing a good job of working
out and she’s being pretty care-
ful, taking care of it and com-
ing back slowly.

In August, she’ll be ready to
go.”

In Driscoll’s absence, the
Panthers got a boost from oth-
ers in last year’s recruiting
class.

“It was really nice to see
other people plug in the area
we thought Jenny would help
out most,” Woodstra said.

“I think Alyssia Yannick did a
great job last year. I know that
she’ll be even better this year.
Hopefully we’ll have her
healthy throughout this sea-
son.” v

Bucs ’ last-gasp hopes crash with Slick 's collarbone

St. Louis’ catcher Erik Pappas drove a
Denny Neagle pitch deep into the out-
field at Busch Stadium Monday night.
Andy Van Slyke charged back to try to
save the day. Van Slyke specializes in
saving the mistakes of Pirate pitchers —
mistakes that have come far too often
this season.

This time the Gold Glove center field-
er did not come through and the
attempt cost_the Pirates more than a
home run by Pappas.

Van Slyke will be out until about_mid-
Augustlwith a broken collarbone, if
punchiﬁg another hole in the hull of an

» already-sinking Pirate ship. The pitching

continues to stumble and the Bucco
offense has fallen into mediocrity in
recent weeks. It seemed the Bucs had
reached bottom with a four-game
sweep at the hands of the expansion
Florida Marlins this past weekend, but
now it has gotten worse.

Catching the first—place Phillies has
been as likely as Barry Bonds producing
in the playoffs. Last week, Philadelphia
lost third baseman Dave Hollins, one of
the top run producers in the National
League and didn’t miss a beat. They
continue to be the best

luck. They have had little of either.
Priority one now is not to make any
panic moves. Here the Mets can serve
as the example of exactly how not to
run a baseball organization.
Last week,New York traded Tony
Fernandez to the Blue

team in baseball and
nobody else is even
close. Still, a winning sea-
son and a decent show-
ing in the NL East
seemed possible, espe-

Ryan
Buncher

Jays for outfielder Darrin
Jackson.

The Mets were so des-
perate to unload the
struggling Fernandez and
his big-money contract

cially with encouraging
performances from Paul Wagner and
Neagle since their insertion into the
starting rotation, and with Zane Smith
slated to return soon. Now, the loss of
Van Slyke to an already struggling
offense is the last nail in the coffin.

To have a solid season after the purge
of talent in the last off-season, the Bucs
needed good health and even better

that they ended up get-
ting another overpriced underachiever
in return. Jackson is not a great
prospect and provides little immediate
help. At best, Jackson will be a fill-in if
the Mets unload Vince Coleman, but
who would want him?

In addition to avoiding rash and des-
perate moves that could damage the
team’s future, the Pirates should turn

their focus to the development of their
youngsters. What do the Bucs have to
gain by playing a has-been like Glenn
Wilson and a never-was like Dave Clark
in the place of some of their young out-
field talent’

Maybe this is a good chance to give
Al Martin a chance to play everyday,
with Lonnie Smith or call-up William
Pennyfeather playing center and leading
off.

As for the pitching, it is time to send
Tim Wakeﬁeld down. A pitcher with
shaky control is not much help in the
bullpen. Wakefield could‘ really use the
chance to regain his magic from last
season starting against minor leaguers.

However the rest of the season goes,
the Pirates’ hold on hopes for this sea-
son probably broke along with Van
Slyke’s collarbone Monday night.

-Yo! Barry running back! It’s called a
contract. Okay, so maybe an all-pro
making just over $400,000 is unfair. So
is overrated has-beens making three or
four mill as they often do.

Truth is, Foster really hit below the
hip pads in lying to head coach Bill
Cowher about only missing part of
mini-camp. Cowher was the one who
stuck with Foster early last season
despite the fumbles and gave the star .
tailback his chance to shine.

0Sleazy moves with ticket prices or
not, props are due to Penguins’ owner
Howard Baldwin for saying he will not

the team’s broadcasting crew. The Pens
don’t need a guy who forgets that it is
the players on the ice, not the announc-
ers, who are supposed to be the show.

As for the ticket price thing: if you
don’t like it, don’t pay it. It’s called mar-
ket value, people.

It’s also called KBL.

-Remember when Marcus Allen and
Eric Dickerson were both in L.A. and
they were the two best backs in foot-
ball? Now both are trying to revive their

careers — Marcus in Kansas City, Eric in
Atlanta.

Allen is a class guy getting a shot in a
class organization. Dickerson fits in
Atlanta. He, Jerry Glanville and Deion
Sanders deserve each other. Here’s hop-
ing both get what they deserve as the
year goes on.

-Memo to Bob Costas: get a heart.
Drazen Petrovic’s body isn’t even cold
and you are asking Chuck Daly how the

night?

-Anybody catch Kelly Gruber’s line
when he returned to third base for the
California Angels a couple of weeks
ago? Sez he's still the best third base-
man in baseball! Sure, and Bubby
Brister is the best quarterback in foot-
ball. Thanks Kelly, we need moxie from
a guy who sits out games with hang-

a better pitching staff than
the Pirates have this year

Bucco pitching guru Ray
Miller deserves better.

again, tough guy!

-While we’re on the NBA, the CS
crew calls the Bulls—Suns series over by
Friday’s Letterman rerun (in five, for
you late-night virgins). MJ and the
Scotties semi—chilled through that
marathon-of-a—messy triple OT hoopfest
— seems they thought they were play-
ing the pre-desperation Sunburneds.

Don’t worry, it’s over.

°Hey, there was a Tim Wakefield
sighting in the Bucco bullpen Monday

So do Bucco fans.

-Streak or no streak, Cal Ripken Jr. is
not getting the job done for the Orioles.
Let’s just say Billy isn’t the only Ripken
who can’t hit anymore.

-Has anybody seen Bo Jackson lately?
Other than in another self-serving iced-
tea commercial?

- Caught Stealing adds its voice to the
chorus crying that this is no way for a
great one like Pudge Fisk to go out.
Hey Chisox, show some class.

-Aren’t you glad the Bucs don’t need
expansion draft departee Danny
Jackson (6-2, 3.21 ERA with the
Phillies)?

-All 116,770 people who placed All-
Star votes for Darryl Strawberry
(through last Sunday) should be sus-
pended from the stands for at least a
week. Strawberry should be gone at
least a month for impersonating a tal-
ented ball player.

°Has anybody noticed that the Detroit
Tigers actually have a good pitching
staff? With Bill Gullickson back and
pitching well, them Motor City Kitties
are definitely for real.

°Winning that tuff-stuff division —
the AL East — could be an even bigger
prize with the mess in the West. As of
Monday, the first—place Hal McRoyals
have the same record as the St. Louis
Cardinals, currently 11 1/2 games
behind the Phillies in the NL East.

-How about that College World
Series? No lead was safe. Do you think
that those relief pitchers in that series
have been using Pirates games as
instructional videos?

Rhymes ineligible, leaves Pitt,
Williams sprints to US. Nat’ls

The Panthers’ basketball
team lost a major contributor
from last season when guard
Marlon Rhymes decided not
to return to Pitt next fall.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
reported that Rhymes left
because he was declared aca-
demically ineligible by the
university.

After a strong start last
year, Rhymes’ productivity
and playing time dissipated
as the season wore on.
Rhymes played mostly at
shooting guard, starting three
games, but also backed up
Jerry McCullough at point.
He did not play at all in Pitt’s
Big East tournament loss to
Syracuse.

In a surprising attempt to
find some offense, head
coach Paul Evans

minutes as Utah ran the
Panthers out of the NCAA

than he had played in the
previous seven games.

Pitt officials did look into
the allegation at the time, but
John Bolvin, Pitt’s faculty rep-
resentative to the NCAA, said
it was dismissed for lack of
evidence.

The report comes as the
NCAA continues to conduct
its own investigation of the
Pitt athletic program.
University officials refused to
comment on the situation
with Hamilton.

Big East baseball seeks the national spotlight

By Tom Schneider
Stajf Writer

Another season of NCAA baseball 1
went in the books this past Saturday I
when the Tigers of Louisiana State shut
out the Wichita State Shockers to collect
its second College World Series title in
four years.

Despite the notable absences of
perennial contenders such as Miami,
Stanford and Arizona, this year’s World
Series featured mostly familiar faces.
Nearly all of the teams in the CWS this
year have been there before, and sever-
al of them have won the championship.

As has been the trend in NCAA
Division I baseball, this year’s tourna-
ment consisted of predominantly south-
ern and western teams without ‘much
representation from the northeast
region. And for baseball fans in this
area, the slugfest in Omaha was missing
one important thing — a Big East team.

As a matter of fact, since the confer-
ence began in 1985, teams have
advanced to the NCAA tournament and
compiled an overall record of 14-22. No
Big East team has advanced to the
CWS.

As a result, the Big East has tradition-
ally received little respect from other
conferences — as well as those in
charge of NCAA Division I power rank-
ings. Before the season began, the Big
East was hovering in the mid—teens in
terms of conference power out of the
33 conferences overall.

However, that was before the season
began,

Before Pitt transformed into one of
the strongest offensive forces in the
nation (.533 team BA, 8.85 runs/game),
and Boston College junior Mike Martin
finished the season ranked third in the
nation in batting (.462 BA).

Before, St. John’s and Connecticut
earned bids to the NCAA regionals +
with the Redmen dethroning defending
national champion Pepperdine on the
way to the West Regional finalagainst
Arizona State.

Needless to say, the conference as a

whole earned a great deal of respect
from the rest of the country with the
performance of its teams this season.
Attesting to that, the postseason power
rankings now list the Big‘ East at num-
ber seven.

A Now, the only thing left to do is to
find that final pieceof the magic puzzle
that, when completed, will propel a Big
East team into the national spotlight at

Matt Serlin/T he Pitt News
Pitt coach Mark Jackson is amajor reason for the Big East's success in 1993.

Omaha.

That final piece may be difficult to
find, however.

Over the past few seasons, as the
conference has improved, it becomes
more and more evident that the things
keeping the Big» East from reaching that
upper echelon are finance and schedul-
ing.

“We are trying to upgrade the sched-

ules  get an opportunity to play better
teams,” St. John’s head coach Joe Russo,
a member of the NCAA Division I base-
ball committee, said. “I feel [the Big
East] is already competitive with anyone
in the nation.”

“I don’t think it’s the cost [of travelling
to face western teams], as much as miss-
ing school,” Seton Hall head coach Mike
Sheppard said. “I think the Big East is
more academically oriented. Taking a
trip out west not only costs money, but
the kids would miss a lot of school.
That might be OK for some other
schools, but in the Big East, I think edu-
cation comes first.”

Another entity the conference lacks is
a true heavyweight —— rich in baseball
tradition — like Miami. '

Unfortunately for the conference,
baseball is the only sport that Miami
does not participate in as a Big East
member — opting instead for indepen-
dent status.

“I think it would be great if Miami
were in the Big East,” said Russo. “Since
[former Miami head coach Ronl Fraser
left, they haven’t been as good as they
were in past years. We very well could
see them join the Big East.

“I think it would do a lot of good for
the league.”

Perhaps the missing piece of the puz-
zle that will catapult the Big East into
the next level has already been found.

Maybe what the conference needs is
fresh ideas and bold tactics from the
new crop of coaches that have just
begun to lay down a foundation, coach-
es like Providence’s Paul Kostacopoulos
and Boston College’s Richard Maloney.

And especially Pitt’s Mark Jackson;

Jackson’s aggressive style that empha-
sizes speed and power is exactly what
the conference needs — a program that
can put up big offensive numbers on a
regular basis.

This is the same run—and-gun style
that Jackson used when he made Point
Park College a regular participant in the
NAIA Division I College World Series.

Who knows? Maybe it can give the
Big East its first ticket to the big show. .
