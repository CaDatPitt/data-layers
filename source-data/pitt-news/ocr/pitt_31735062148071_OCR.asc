During silence week fraternities
will submit their bids on individual
bid cards to the oﬁice of the dean of

their notices by mail instead of be-
ing contacted through their classes.

Upon receipt of a notice, the pros-

have made him.

Fraternity men who approach

with red and green, with alternate
designs of dragons with pearls of
wisdom in their mouths and a pair of
phoenix birds with the Mon-tan
ﬂower, symbol of happiness.

tral panel are smaller triangles rep-
resenting the four seasons.

At one end of the room is a like-
ness of K’ur_1g-Fu-Tsze (Confucius)
cut in a stone tablet. This portrait
is a painstaking copy of the original
in the Confucius temple in Shang-
tung province, the birthplace of the

Three thousand copies of the initial

committee for a really snazzy dance
last Friday. King Stark and Queen
Yorio led the dance in grand style.
The Newman Club followed up with
another highly successful shindig at
Carnegie Tech’s Thistle Hall the next
p. m.

Among the Pitt notables seen cut-
ting the rug were Pat Cusick, SFA
prexy, Bob Johnson, one of Dr. Carl-
son’s kids, John Bazyk, who throws
the iron-ball (shot-put to you)
farther than any other Pitt man,
Jack Glenn and Tom Holleran of the
Phi Kaps, and those _Pantherettes
Ruth McClain, Theo Kearns, ‘Mary
Ruth Hosey, and Jean Hanlon.

Note: That gleam inthe eyes of
' lovely Marianna Wolfe is not there
‘because of the ﬁne new crop, ‘of
freshman boys but because she’s
sporting an engagement ring given
by one Casimir Kopec, last year’s
cross-country star.’ Although he
works in Detroit, Cass manages to
spend every week-end in town
‘ here.

Cross Country

Discovered: Why handsome Frank

encouragement to the local beauties.
Her name is Estrea Davenport and
she’s the pride of Ashtabula, Ohio.

O.A.O. from Seton Hill around more-. 

often. She looks like the late Jean

Observations: After seeing Ma-

Sundstrom, Jane Spencer, Jean
Brink, and some of the other cam-

‘ pus cuties, we still think that the
Pitt femmes take the top rating.

News Pr“o'gnostic.ator   Sees Win
For Panther Eleven Tomorrow

By Bert Jaffe _

Keeping in step with other sport writers throughout the country,
your Pitt News reporter has taken upon himself the task ‘of picking
the winners of tomorrow ’s football games.

In picking out‘ the games to give the winners, it is the sole aim of
The News in following up Pitt and its opponents, past and future.

Pitt 20, W. Va. 6.
ﬂashes of power with Cassiano, Bon-
em, and Kish lugging the ball, and an
aerial attack the equal of the famed
“southwest circus” in trouncing
Washington, 27-6.

Mountaineers Tough

However, the. Mountaineers must
not be taken too lightly after win-
ning 44-O over West Virginia Wes-
leyan. Clark, Carliss, and McCann
are all ace runners, capable of break-
ing into the clear at any stage of the
game. I

Duke 14, Colgate 7. Duke should
come through after a tough afternoon.
Keep onithe look out for the two
McAfees. The “Red Raiders” of Col-
gate lost a heart—breaking 7-6, de-
cision to NYU while the “Blue Dev-
ils” conquered Davidson, 26-6.

Tech 28, Temple 0. With two sets
of backs able to “carry the mail,” the
Tartans should have little difficulty
pinning down the Owls.

Gophers To Win

Minnesota 27, Nebraska 0. The
Gophers ran wild against a weak
Arizona eleven, 62-0 and look like an
easy victor over “Biff” Jones’ Corn-
Lhuskers.

Penn State 13, Bucknell 0. It was
Bucknell’s game 14-0 last year, but
Lou Tomesetti received his sheep-
skin this past spring. ,

Fordham 14, Alabama 10. Ford-
ham looks like the powerhouse of
the cast, but the Crimson Tide may
provide an upset.

Duquesne 20, Waynesburg 7. The

Pitt showed’

Yellowjackets put up a courageous
ﬁght against Fordham last week but
wilted in the second half. It looks
like a victory, for “Buf”f’s” team to-
night.

UCLA 13, Washington 13. Wash-
ingtonshould bounce right back from
its defeat of last week and surprise
the U clans. The'nLos Angeles’ eleven
won its initial game last week‘ from
TCU, 6-2. B ' i ' ’

There you have it. If we’re stick-
ing our necks out too far, remember
that Thanksgiving is coming soon,
and the cannibals have_a word for it.

Commissioner. Receives Reports

Of Big Ten Athletic Practices

:spc«.~mi to "-“he. Pitt News

Chi<~:~go", Ill., Oct. 5.--Regular reports on the conduct of Western Con-

ference athletics are currently being received

office of the Big Ten’s Commissioner.

from member schools in the

Acting oinpthe principle that the 300 coaches and departmental associ-
ates in the ten Conference schools are most qualiﬁed to observe practices in
their area, the Big Ten relies upon their reports in the administration of its

standards. _,

“It is physically impossible for one
man or even a singlecoﬁice to report
on practices in a group as small even
as is our Big Ten Conference,” ac-
cording to the Commissioner. 

“As a consequence each Big Ten
athletic director regularly calls his
staff into session, asking for reports
on athletic practices as observed by
the men under him in their manifold
contacts.”

Conference Reports

“-It is obvious the Conference di-
rectors, as a result of the experience
of their men through their contacts,
are more’ aware of facts and prac-
tices in their group than any indi-
vidual pcissibly could determine in
any sort of cursory observation,” he
adds.

Reports or rumors of questionable
practices are forwarded to the cen-
tal office not in the form of charges,
but as questions. The questions are
then referred to the respective mem-
ber schools involved for answer or

explanation, and in event of the rare ,

unsatisfac'tory explanation or answer
an investigation may be conducted’
by the Commissioners office.
School Records-

“Such a, procedure not only brings
to light all questions of any sort
which may be current regarding any
incident involving a particular
school,” the Commissioners reports
“but in the manner o-f their submis-
sion a maintenance of friendly rela-
tionships ‘is positively assured.

That means of bringing tollight sit-
uations capable of creating misunder-
standings; if not so presented and in-
vestigated is supplemented by records
submitted by each Conference school
relative to its own practices and ad-
herence to Conference standards.

In addition to certiﬁcates of eligi-
bility for each athlete a complete rec-

on the old off-tackle attack to cope
with West Virginia’s pass defense.
The success of Pitt’s passing attack

can be traced to the fact that the’

passer is throwing the pigskin from a
more relaxed position and is having
an easier time spotting the intended
receiver.

Tomorrow’s starting team will be
the same as opened the game against
the Huskies with the possible ex-
ception of Dick Fullerton who is suf-
fering from an aggravated leg in-
jury. Steve Sinco may get the nod
from Bowser over Harry Hawkins.

LLOYD CHILD at Buffalo Airport, scene of his recent world record power-dive
—more than 575 m.p.h. in the Curtiss Hawk 75-A—— pauses to give his slant on
cigarettes: “I've smoked Camels for about ﬁfteen years. I knew that they were the
long-burning cigarette. That means more smoking for my money. On a pack of ‘
twenty, as those scientiﬁc reports show, it’s like getting ﬁve extra smokes per pack.
It’s the rigbt kind of smoking, too—mild and swell, cooler, non-irritating, better for
my kind of steady, day-after-daynsmoking.” Don’t miss the fun of smoking Camels!
Enjoy their matchlesslblend of choice tobaccos. . .while enjoying the economy of that
long-burning feature that_ma,k_e-s “penny for penny your best cigarette buy.”
