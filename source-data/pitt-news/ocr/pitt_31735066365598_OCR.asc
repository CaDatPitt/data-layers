The property, purchased by GSA,.was to have been
used for the proposed Phase I expansion program of
the University of Pittsburgh. It would have included a
law School complex, School of Education, and facil-
ities for various Social Science‘Departments, plus un-
derground parking. However, the plan was scrapped I
because of pressures from the city, the Shapp admin-

Consumer budget

, by LOIS LEVINSON

Nineteen hundred and seventy-two is being called the "year of the
consumer" and Donna Deaner. director of the Consumer Protection
Bureau of .-Xllegheny County. would like the County Commissioners to
support this statement by more than doubling her budget.

The Bureau is presently receiving $50.000 and is asking for $112.-
000. The bulk of the present budget pays the salaries of the six people
on the staff. who along with the desks and pencils.in Deane‘r‘s office.
have been borrowed from other bureaus.

Two campus policemen dismiss-
ed for their alleged involvement in
an assault against a fellow officer
have asked their request for re-
instatement with back pay be set-
tled by arbitration.

At a student newspaper press conference last week. Deaner-said
that government is "setting up consumer protection agencies but isn’t
funding them or giving them laws to work with.“ She said she wants to

hire more complaint mediators with expertise in relevant fields. Much‘

of the work is being done by student volunteers.
“At first, said Deaner, “we were going to get into every problem

V and complaint, but we soon found out that this would be spread_ing our-

selves too thin. Now we limit ourselves to buyer-seller relationships.”

Although it has no actual legal power. the Bureau's cases can end
up in court. Using an example of a complaint concerning a defective

carpet. Deaner outlined Bureau's procedure. -‘

After the complaint is called in. a.staff home economist is sent to
the home of the caller. If the—staff tnember agrees that the merchan-
dise is defective. the carpet company is contacted and usually makes ‘
amends. However.if.the merchant r_ef'uses to act on the Bureau's sug-
_‘  gestion._ the Bureau helps the. consumer prepare -his case and uses-the

of the officers touched the com-
plaintant.

_It was decided to take the grie-

fice. proved unsatisfactory.

hike proposed   .

- Thus far, the Bureau. has brought 15 cases to court and has won
every one, mainly, said Deaner, because of the weight of the staff’s
testimony. '

‘Deaner cited the most frequent complaints from students as those
concerning rent. She said that most students are exploited by landlords
who won't give back deposits. claiming damage that was never done.

To curtail -this. she suggested. “A system where by their apart-
ments are appraised as of day of departure by a board set up within

[the school to deal with student rent problemsf"

Another facet of the Bureau Deaner would like to see expanded is
its Educational Program for the Consumer that teaches people how to
spot phony licenses and contracts. '

"If people could make a phone call and check on salesman who
come around‘ selling home improvements..etc.."°she said. "they would
not have to call here later witha complaint.“ '

One of her projects is to get the County to license and bond home
ir'nprover_nent contractors to keep out “fly-by-night" contractors.

Stressing the need for all consumer protection agencies to work
together,~Deaner spoke enthusiastically about PIRG (Public Interest
Research Group). PIRG is a college student~funded program that will

hire a staff of professionals to investigate problems concerning racial _-

and sexual ,discrimination, environmental protection, and consumer
protection, and who will be empowered to take direct action against
offenders. * -

Deaner saidlthat PIHG will create an. effective lobb'ying force for
citizens interests in governmentand will be able, to go far beyond the
small areaher a'gency.can cover. " ' .  . v -’ . ,.

Annual Giving Ftintl
earns Pitt rccoirtl 

by LINDA SAVAGE

A record amount was donated
to the L'niversit_\' during the 1070-
71 Annual Giving Fund

A total-of’ $5519.91? was recei 1 ed.

Altiiiini contribtited .$:331.08.‘l.
while non-alumni donated $32.02;").
Lforporations contribtited $3-1.209.

Alumni from the School of Medi-
cine were the largest contributors
while alumni from the Law School
had the largest percentage of
graduates contributing. ‘

According‘ to the report ptiblish—
ed by theFund. the 1970-71 figures
surpassed the 1969-70 figures‘ by
15.2 per cent in dollars and 48.8
per cent in ntiinber of donors.

“The average individual gift de-
clined to $39 from the $50 level at-
tained in 1909-70.“ stated the re-
port. "However. the striking ad-
vance in the nuinerical base of
.\lIpp()l'l€l‘.\‘~—~l.600 additional don-
ors of whom almost 4.000 were
truly new first-timers—is both

In addition to its sponsoring of
the Annual Giving Fund. the Of-
lice of Alumni Affairs is planning
an additional survey of 3.000 Pitt
Alumni. Bernard Kopereck. direc-

is presentl_\' in its final planning
stages.

Because the results of the last
surve_v. taken in 1960. were not
comprehensive._ Koperek said. the
recipients will be selected by a
tormtila to ensure balance and a
meaningful statistical sample.

Members of the Sociology De-

tee of five alumni to plan the sur-
vey. Results will be determined
by computer.

The questionnaire consists of
60 questions covering three basic
areas: academic and social back-

Rostropovich sparkles despite
%Heinz Hall’s cavernous

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

Mstislav Rostropovich. cellist.
pianist. and general spokesman
for the freedom of the arts in the
Soviet Union, ‘received a warm
Pittsburgh reception last Satur-
day as he presented a recital pro-
gram at Heinz Hall.

Rostropovich is a performer

' whose talents have been recogniz-

ed not only by audiences wherever
he goes but by a great number _of
composers of such stature as Pro-
kofiev and Britten who have writ-
ten works with his abilities speci-
"fically in mind.

Rostropovich and his compan-
ion at the keyboard. Alexander
Detukin, accepted a musical
gauntlet spanning 200 years in
works by Bach, Beethoven,

guﬁtrauss, and Prokofiev. The pro-

gram opened with an Adagio by J.
S. Bach, a soothing and restful
composition. ending as the cell-
ist’s final notes recede into noth-
ingness. ‘

In complete contrastr was Bee-
t-hoven’s Twelve Variations on a
Theme from The Magic Flute.
Based on the famous aria of
Papageno’s from Mozart’s opera, a

jovial and playful flavor per-,

meated this entire work. Rostru-
povich’s technique was a delight
throughout.

The balance of the program was
devoted to two Sonatas of Richard
Strauss and Serge Prokofiev.
Broad bowing brought a wonder-

fully mellow tone to the slow
movement. while a series of flaw-
less runs brought the work to a
lively conclusion.

There are no doubts that this
was indeed a memorable recital.
But as far as the suitability of

. Heinz Hall as a recital hall for

Chamber music, that is something

else.

Intimacy is the important as-
pect in chamber music. The ar-

\....J

stage  

tists must be in close proximity
te the audience. It was certainly
not the case for those of us in the
Heinz Hall gallery who were al-
most unable to see the cellist far
below. The sight of two lone mu-
sicians on a cavernous stage sur-
rounded by a massive orchestral
shell is a bit ridiculous. As a re-
sult. the performance was hardly
as enriching as it might have been
under more suitable circum-
stances. '

Bach Choir conveys competence \

by DAVE KOLAKOSKI

A thoughtful performance of Johann Sebastian
Bach’s Christmas Oratoria was delivered by the
Bellefield Presbyterian Church’s Bach Choir this
past Sunday evening. '

. Stanley E. Tagg, organist and choir director at
the Eastminster UP Church in East. Liberty, dem-
onstrated his competence as he communicated his
sense of line and appreciation of the music to the
choir, and so to the audience. ’

Also under his baton was a fine complement of
musicians, consisting of members of the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra and students from local uni-
‘versities.

Outstanding exposure was given the trumpe-

teers. The music was techically very difficult, and
in spite of’ a few minor errors and a missed en-
trance, they displayed respectable competence.

The recitatives, ariosos. and da capo arias
were sensitively performed by four soloists from 10-

cal churches. Tenor David Evans. soloist at Cal- .

Such was’ the case with soprano Jill Weller,
former soloist at Eastminster. With the exception
of a slight shrillness in the upper register, and that
only on the difficult long E vowel, her vocals were
praiseworthy.

The most impressive of the four was Marge

Unfortunately. the delegation p'roc-rastinated until-next Jan-

Allowing freshman to participate in the two major collegi-

tensive effects on any institution or particular team as other"
changes had in,the past. Nevertheless, it will present many ad-
vantages to bothgthe teams and the prospective competitors.
Primarily, the quality of the respective teams should im-
prove for several reasons. Though no team with a strong pro»
gram should need to rely on many rookies. one or two ‘high
school stars in key positions may improve the‘squad's strength.
Furthermore. a team impaired by injuries late in the season can

would give freshmen and upperclassmen the opportunity to gain,
‘experience for varsity action. This could be an additional step;
in the direction of higher caliber teams.

For the athlete with definite aspirations of reaching the
pro field in‘ either sport, the new ruling is most’ beneficial. The ;
additional year of eligibility will give this athlete -the added ex-

‘ posure he desires.

A prime advantage to coaches will be the opportunity to

Before the Pitt Cubs defeated the highly regarded \\'est \-/'i.ginia
treshnien. 73-67. Tim Grgurich was a very relaxed coach.

"Allegheny Community was a big game for us." he calmly related.
"but West Virginia—xhas their greatest group offreshmen in a long

'while.“

Grgurichs ‘logic was rightly
justified as the Mountaineer
frosh sported an advantage in

_ both height and weight. With 6-10
Sam Kilburn. 6-8 Larry Carr. and

'5, 6-6 Scott MacDonald starting for
the" Mounties. it seemed evident

that it would takejmore than an
ordinary game for the Cubs to win
their fifth straight game:

“We’ve been working on the
press a lot,” continued—_Grgur-

l  “We plan to do the same thing’

‘we’.ve been doing. We’ll press and
try to runwhen we can.” 0‘
