An estimated 60-day delay in the
opening of construction bids for the
student union renovations has been
caused by the university’s failure to
take into account a l9l3 contracting
law. Re-design of architectual plans
to conform with the law may cost the
university upwards of $4,000 to

$5,000. according to George Sim-B

mons, project on . the
renovation.

The law, the Separation Act of
l9l3, specifies that construction
projects using public funds must
open the competitive bidding pro-
cess to at least four types ofcontrac-
tors (electrical, plumbing, etc.).

In Pitt’s case, nine general con-
tractors were invited to submit bids
August 3. The winning general con-
tractor would have then hired the
other contractors.

But after being informed by Ed
Richey, executive director of the
Mechanical Contractors Associa-
tion of Western Pennsylvania lnc.,
that it may have been in violation of
the law, Pitt decided to postpone the
opening of the bids Thursday after-

manager

, noon. Bidding will now be open to‘

five types of contractors: general
construction; heating; ventilation

  Renovations

and air conditioning; plumbing;
electricity; and elevators.

The project is being financed in
part through public bonds obtained
through the Allegheny County
Higher Education Assistance
Authority. The authority is still
awaiting final approval by the state
before any bonds can be issued.

The costs of conforming with the
law result from specification
changes the architects will have to
make to allow for different contrac-
tors, Simmons said.

“lt’s a nasty situation," Simmons
sid. “We’re putting quite a bit of heat
on the architects” to redesign the
plans.

John Vrana, assistant vice chan-
cellor for business and finance, said
that when plans were being'deve-
loped for the renovations, the uni-
versity had notanticipatcd using the
authority to finance part of the
project. -

The university decided to,use the
authority when it discovered--it could
obtain low-cost, tax-free bonds for
the financing of -projects such as the
student union renovations, Vrana
said.’ A fraternity housing complex

and construction of a business
school building are also being
financed in part by the authority.

“l wouldn’t say it's an oversight,”
Vrana said. “The primary goal of the
project was to get it moving."

“Delays in major kinds ofprojects
are not out of the ordinary," he said.

“They happen. The thing isto deal

with them as quickly as you can.”

Commuters coming into Oak-
land can anticipate additional
traffic headaches besides the
Parkway East for the next sev-
eral weeks because of utility
replacements that started this
week on Forbes Avenue.

Fred Just, a community
planner for the City of Pitts-
burgh, said that motorists on
Forbes will face a “major incon-
venience” until late October
because of the installation of
street lights and traffic signals.

The street lights on Forbes
between Craft and Morewood
avenues,wil| be replaced with
more modern ones. and all the
utility cables for these lights will

"A be underground, Just said. New
traffic signals to be installed in
the area will also feature under-
ground cables.

The $l-7 million dollar pro-
ject, Just said, is a result of the
Oakland Plan and encompasses
a‘ wide variety of renovations.

4 Forbes Repairs Begin

The Oakland Plan is a commun-
ity project devised last year to
upgrade the neighborhoods. the
business district and the educa-
tional facilities in Oakland.
Just said the new utilities will
increase the value of Forbes
Avenue. ‘
ln, addition to the utilities,
asphalting will begin on Forbes
between Atwood Street and
Morewood before winter. The
intersections are being worked
on first to avoid major problems
in the winter. The city expects all
the work to be completed by next
spring, according to Just.
One-way traffic on two side
streets will also be changed this
fall. The one-way signs on Oak-
land~Avenue and Bouquet Street
will be reversed between Forbes
and Fifth avenues, and traffic
signals will be installed. Once the
changes are made, motorists will
_be permitted to go down Bou-
quet and up Oakland.
Also slated for construction or

Pitt went to the first day ofschool
in the New District.

And Pitt will be involved with the
newly-forfned district—»the result of
a court-ordered merger of several
east suburban Pittsburgh school dis-
tricts to achieve desegregation~for
at least an entire year.

What is a nice urban university
doing, in the midst ofa controversial
suburban school district merger,
implemented despite court battles
and public protests?

Helping to implement it, of
course. Desegreghtion doesn’t
happen overnight, orjust because of
a court" order. Realizing this," the
New District officials turned to
Pitt’s Race Desegregation Assist-

-‘ ance Center for help in achieving

desegregation.

“Our goal is the maintenance of
quality education, and the ‘aware-
ness of cultural diversity," said Dr.
Ogle Duff, director of the center.

The l 1-year-old, federally-funded
center is the first such center to be
established in the North, and one of
only IS in the country.

lts purpose is to aid school dis-
tricts in Pennsylvania and Delaware
experiencing difficulties in desegre-

' gating. The center holds workshops

and hires consultants, dealing with

A each party involved in the desegre-

gation separately.
" During August, for example, the

T center held individual sessions for
, everyone involved in the New Dis-

trict, from teachers, to administra-
tors to security personnel.

“There’s a need for all representa-
tives in the district to have some kind
of training," Duff said. “They learn
strategies and techniques to enable

‘them to work successfully in their

new environment.”
For teachers and administrators,

tural diversity of their student
population.

But for the students themselves,
the key is inclusion.

“The students need to be included
in all aspects of the school’s social
system," Duff said. Student status
.groups——cheerleaders, class officers,
football players~—should represent
the entire student population not
just an individual group.

The importance of student status
groups is often overlooked by adults
who forget social structure of their
high school years, Duff added.

But parents of the students
affected by the merger are openly
hostile to it. So were some officials
of the districts, until Federal Dis-
trict Court Judge Gerald Weber
imposed a gag order in August bar-
ring them from criticizing the New
District or impeding its
implementation.

And when the New District inte-
rim operating committee announced
to a crowded Churchill ‘high school
auditorium that it had enlisted the
aid of the Pitt desegregation center,
the response was considerably less
than enthusiastic. Some parents
claimed the center workers used foul
language; others claimed it had a

poor track record on its other dese-~'

gregation efforts. '

This, Duff said, is merely propo-
ganda, aimed at anyone who is try-
ing to achieve what some parents are
opposed to.

“Our reputation stands for itself,"
Duff said. “They(the opponents) are
trying to discredit anyone focusing
on the desegregation process."

A school district does not pay for
the center's work because it is feder-
ally funded. The district invites the
center to help it, and if at any__time
the district becomes dissatisfied with

\the center’s work, the centers servi-

ces can be discontinued.'The center
is staffed with professors from Pitt's
School of.Education.

Duff said the center has worked
for several years with the Pittsburgh
city school districts. For a year, it
will work intensively with the new
district at desegregating the high
school; next year there is a possibil-
ity the center might work at the ele-
mentary level."

President Reagan‘s budget cuts
have reduced about 25 percent ofthe
center's funding, but Duff main-
tained that there is little possibility
the center would be eliminated.

“Who will these schools turn to
when they need help  desegregat-
ing if there is no center‘? she said.

SGB Gets

Ready
For Year

By scor sroms

News Editor

This year’s Student Government
Board is moving into its new offices
in Schenley Hall, and has plans to
move into several new areas of con-
cern to students.

According to Bill Abraham, SGB
president, the board has not decided
on when it will be holding its weekly
meetings, but sometime next week.
it will hold several planning sessions
to get organized and solicit student
input.

Abraham cited several issues that
will receive major attention by the
board this fall.

0 Affirmative Action: Last fall,
the SGB recommended that a spe-
cial committee be established to
improve understanding, among stu-
dents, ofthe various goals and impli-
cations of the affirmative-action
program. Consequently, last April,
SGB sponsored a workshop for stu-
dent leaders on the topic.

According to Abraham, the main
problem at Pitt, is the “perceived
segregation ofthe student commun-
ity.”

The new committee will co-
ordinate “educational" activities
aimed at the general student popula-
tion, and program a series ofspeak-
ers and events related to
affirmative-action.

0 Constitutional Revision: One of
the largest projects this year’s board
has before it is the reorganization of
their constitution. According to
Abraham, the constitution has been
in place for “five or six years,” and
the question now is whether that
document can effectively “provide

- for the needs of students inithe ’80s.

“There are a couple ofthings that
need to be tinkered with and some

SGB has moved into its new home and is
preparing for a new year.

things that have to be changed,”
Abraham said. “But how extensive
those changes will be, I couldn’t tell
you at this point.”

One proposal that will be consi-
dered is the formation ofan “execu-
tive council” to coordinate activities
of the four standing committees of
the board.

Abraham said that SGB created
an informal committee last year to
develop revision proposals.

Because the revised constitution is
scheduled to be on a ballot, along
with candidates for the board this
November, it is “important" to get
all the details worked out quickly.

0 University—Wide Student Ac-
tivities Recognition Policy: This
plan, being worked out in the Office

of Student Activities is designed to F

streamline and clarify the require-
ments for the recognition and fund-
ing of the various student activities
groups.

the actual guidelines have not
been published, but, according to
Abraham, they will set general rules
for all student government groups
that recognize and fund activities.

The goal of the new policy is to

s ,BREATHTAK,lNC__-. REA LlST|C - A MASTERIECE  

avoid redundancy in funding, and
clarify who, specifically, is eligible
for recognition.

Abraham added that the new
rules will still grant a measure of
autonomy to the individual gover-
nance groups, so that they may tai-
lor requirements to their own
specific requirements.

0 Tuition Hikes, Student Aid:
“The measure of cost in education is
the difference between tuition and
aid,” Abraham said.

it is this difference which has
grown over the last few years, thatis
making the cost ofcollege more and
more prohibitive.

Because of the increase in tuition
at Pitt, and the reductions in state
and federal aid programs, SGB is
planning a new approach in its lob-
bying efforts. Rather than approach
Harrisburg in December, after the
governor has announced his spend-
ing policy, Abraham hopes that

‘SGB pressure will forcethe gover-

nor’s office to consider a higher level
of appropriation, before he ‘drafts
his budget policy.

According to Abraham, SGB

‘ also plans to Contact officials on the

federal level.

Terrorism:

By PAUL UNDERWOOD

In Iran this week, a bomb ripped
through the clergy’s political head-
quarters, killing that nation‘s presi-
dent and prime minister. On
Wednesday. another bomb went off
in the center ofLima, Peru, again for
a political cause. A third bomb
exploded in a car parked outside
NATO air base in West Germany,

~ apparently as a protest against" the

U.S. position on nuclear
proliferation. ..

We are again witness_1ng the
rebirth of violence as a political
force. The threat of indiscriminate
destruction is a trendy political wea-
pon that fades in and out ofuse. The

previous popular tact was kidnap-

ping; higher stakes seem to have
made the means even more
desperate.

It is probably a misnomer to say
that violence is again in vogue; it
never really fell out of fashion. It
may be the legacy of the terrorist

groups spawned in the I960s that ,

makes bombings and destruction so
appealing. What made the Palestine
Liberation Organization viable——
and gave voice to its demands--was
its rocket attacks
bombings. Suddenly, the PLO was
transformed from a band of home-
less refugees to a nation without
borders.

Perhaps the most destructive ele-
ments of political violence is its
aftermath. Large bombings are

._—__._

and political ,

invariably followed by larger retalia-
tion. and retaliation is followed by
counterbombings. Rarely do these
tactics-—-either the initial action or
their oppositionm-result in the
desired end. The only certain conse— _
quenceof violence is that it promises :
more.

It is not ironic, then, that the rhe-
toric used by these terrorist groups
sounds so similar. Communication
is needless, really, since it is rarely
possible to give a rationale for vio-
lence. Destruction knows no logic;
whether the ends justify the means is
the province of the beholder. The
violence will continue in new and
more lethal forms, and the absurd
speechs of justification will attempt
to explain indiscriminate death.

A Gaggle of
Angry Motorists

Appearances often belie the truth. The line
at the Registrar’s office may look like two
hours, but three is a better guess. The syllabus
may seem impossible, but why worry since
you’lI ignore it anyhow?

In appearance, Pitt would seem like a
major university with 80.to 90 percent on-
campus residents—similar to Penn State. But
better than half of Pitt’s student body is com-
muter, which works out to something on the
top side of 15,000 people. .

Contained in that sect are lots of drivers.
The need for parking is obvious and has been
obvious for decades. The university is con-
stantly acquiring land and beginning new
construction, but rarely has that work been
devoted to providing more parking. ,

Perhaps this seems childish, especially to
someone who hasn’t experienced the thrill of
trying to fit an Oldsmobile in a space meant
for a Suzuki. But it isn’t childish when one is
forced to park in Shadyside and ends up late" 
for class. In.;iMaslowfs=_.-liierarchyl of needs‘-,“'*-‘H’-‘i*:‘l
starting thejday likefthis seem almost
life-threatening. ’ H 

Now the university is doing a feasibility
study of the parking area between Hillman
Library and Carnegie Museum. The study
would test the cost and time needed for
expansion of the area for more parking. This
idea has been around Pitt for years; in that
time, cost have skyrocketed, forcing the uni-
versity to now reconsider the entire project.

There must be a moral from this. Unlike
costs, the number of driving students is rela-
tively stable. An expansion of this lot would
provide spaces (and, no doubt, revenue) for
generations. The price of this project will not
go down, and the frustration experienced by
drivers can only worsen.

The next time the university buys up real
estate, the administrators should convert it
immediately into a huge parking lot—~
something resembling an Andy Warhol
nightmare. It may be ugly, but it’s a far prett-
ier sight than a gaggle of angry motorist.

By WALTER R. WATSON
It all started when I was a mild,
meek staff writer for The Pitt News
two years ago. I had written what I
thought was poetry since the third’
grade. The Pitt News had no room
for my creative pursuits. Showcase,
the entertainment supplement, put
up for me long enough to take
record reviews out of my grubby and
often clammy little hands. Most
situations between myself and the
editors of The Pitt News and Show-
case something like this:
Editor: Have you got it?
Walt: Got what?
Editor: You know wht?

  

 

Walt: Oh that. Sure.
Editor: Where is it?
Walter: What?

Editor: The story.

- Walter: What story?

Editor: The story that was duejust
before this conversation.

Walt: Oh, that story. Here it is.

Editor: Finally. I thought I'd
never see the story.

Walt: What story?

Editor: Never mind.

I soon found a place where people
appreciate creative writing. Not
mine, of course, but somebody’s.
Nonetheless. I was persevering. I
was a fool. I attended meetings of
this organization regularly. It was
called BackSpace and I was a
member by sheer implication. Con-
versation between veteran members

Backspace ne Editor’s saga

of~ the literary magazine sounded
very much like the following:

BackSpacer No. I: Who‘s that
Walter person?

BackSpacer No. 2: Who?

BackSpacer No. I: You know. the
one in the corner with the sweaty
palms, big Afro hairdo, biting his
nails off to the nubs?

BackSpacer No. 2: I thought he
was the janitor.

. BackSpacer No. I: No, thejanitor
died two months ago. This kid‘s
been here everyday for the last three
weeks. "3

BackSpacer No. 2: Does he speak
English?

BackSpacer No. I: Hard to tell.
His poems seem to be in college stu-
dent vernacular.

BackSpacer No 2: You don‘t
mean...

BackSpacer No. I: Exactly. ‘Hey
man. Like, y‘know, ‘cause like, y’see,
the thing oT“it-is...‘

BackSpacer No. 2: Great! We bet-
ter get him a membership card
before he changes his mind. Let’s tell
him. . .

BackSpacer No. I: We're too late.
He just shuddered right out the
door...

After recovering from terminal
shyness with recurring symptoms of
Woody’s Syndrome (i.e. massive
strokes of extreme paranoia fol-
lowed by uncontrollable ﬁts of nail
biting), I became editor of BackS-
pace only to find my office moved
from the fourth floorliof Schenley
Hall, the birthplace ofthe magazine
and its home for nearly eight years.
As in years passed, no one has over
known much about BackSpace
except that it harbored stray dogs,

served a mean cup of coffee (you
want mean‘? This coffee barks, rolls
over, plays dead,‘ and snarls when it
brings you the evening paper. We're
talking mean), occasionally publish-
ing the artwork, fiction and, poetry
of Pitt students.

So, Backspace is in the basement
of the student union, largely unno-

‘ticed behind its drab, grey card-

board walls. BackSpace is barely
shielded from the furiously busy
offices of The Pitt News. Their
editor-in-chief pounjds away at her
typewriter, which is maliciously
placed against an adjoining walljust
outside our walls. Our whispering
conversations oflife, art and the per-
fect cheeseburgerare drowned out
by the roar of flushings from the
basement restrooms and frequent
shouts of “Stop the presses.”

When this editor forgets the key to
his office, he simply climbs over on '
of the 8—foot walls and unlocks the ’ I
door (at best, an embarrassing expe-
rience). On a clear day, you can see
your hands in front of your face. It's
dark down here, and if The Pitt
News decides to call it a night, they
‘can turn off their light switch and
put us further in the dark than we
already are.

As the aggressive, self-assured
editor of Bac'kSpace, it is my duty to
invite your curiosity, indifference or
enthusiasm to our office. We desper-
ately need submissions. I haven't

groveled for anything since I made 3"!“

Remember

By MARK COLLINS

PM News Stall Writer

The parking was impossible. The
team won only three World Series in
65 years; and the wooden seats with
metal armrests became uncomforta-
ble within three innings. Yet the
place somehow had an intangible

Q class that made watching the Pirates

enjoyable.

But, as progress progressed and
the city wanted tojoin major league
status with a major league stadium.
Forbes Field was torn down to make
way for. the Steel and cement of
Forbes Quad. The end was uncere-
monious: The Pirates swept a dou-
bleheader from the Cubs and the
fans swept on the field to take any-
thing that wasn’t bolted down.
Three bricks and a box seat now sit
unceremoniously in my attic.

The opulence of Forbes Quad
provides a strange epitaph to the
simplicity of Forbes Field. The out-
field was built at odd angles to the
diamond (left and center were the
longest in the National League for
years: while right ﬁeld was the shor-
test). and the scoreboard was not
electric, but hand-lettered numbers
were placed in slotted grooves.
Every game, in both leagues, was
followed on scoreboard—inning by
inning. The crowd used to cheer
when the Cubs scored their lone run
in the bottom of the eighth, and
cheer again when the visiting team
thundered back for five runs in the
ninth. The consistency of both the
Cubs and the scorekeepers was
awesome.

So it is fitting that some kind of
reminder ofall those years would be
left untouched by the University.

But the University now plans to
put the Business School on that por-
tion of left field—supposedly to
teach breathless business students
about the mystique of supply and
demand. The irony is inescapable.

The building boom at this univer-
sity has a logic but it has no heart.
There are some——myself included-
who rate baseball and nostalgia as
the only true constants of life. Per-
haps this is simple whining from a
simple mind that harkens to simpler
times; but the ruthlessness with
which Pitt builds should be alarming
to anyone. ’

lt’s more than wistfulness, it’s aes-

ration of young and veteran talent.

JC players. eve gotten our
money’s worth out of them."

Counted on to provide some of
that immediate help is junior
transfer Tony Eason, a 6-4, 205-
pound .quarterback. Eason spent
last season as a redshirtand assumes
the starting job in the large shadow
of Dave Wilson, now with the NFL’s
New Orleans Saints. Wilson started
last year and finished the season
owning I6 Illinois and Big l0.pass-
ing records.

Eason was compared with Wilson
last season, when both transferred to
Illinois. Eason is said to possess the
stronger arm.

“We’ve been told that Wilson
took the starting job last year
because it rained during practice one
day and Wilson threw the ball better
in the rain,” Sherrill said. “Even
though he was redshirted, he did
practice with the team last year."

Still, Sherrill added, Eason
remains an unknown since Satur-
day’s game marks his first major col-
lege start.

“He’s a question mark,” Sherrill
said. “We'll have to see if he’s ready
to play against different coverages
and how well he can read defenses.”

Despite a new starter at quarter-
back, not much else would change in
the Illini passing offense, a system
White dubs the “Flare Flood.” The
Illini averaged roughly 50 passes a
game last year using the system,
which relies on short flares to the
running backs and on "tlooding” a
particular defensive zone with

receivers before the defenders can,

react.

“They’re probably not going to » I

change their offensive philosophy
much," Sherill said. “Personnel-
wise, they haven’t changed that

much.” _

and can also get those tough yards
inside. ‘Rounding out the starting
backfield is Danny White, in his
second year as Dallas quarterback.
White will once again be throwing to
some of the best receivers in the
game. Even if Drew Pearson decides
to hold out, the Cowboys will use
Butch Johnson as his backup. .Pear-
son could lose a job when he comes
back, because Johnson is that good.

The Dallas defense is solid except
in the secondary" where an injury to
(Randy Hughes could prove critical.
A solid rush from the front four,
however, will help the secondary a

i great deal. .
Overall, there are no major weak- A

nesses.Dallas has another
powerhouse.

2. Washington: Surprised? Don’t
be. The Re skins are the a most
improved team in the NFL.

With Joe Gibbs as the new coach,
Washington has not seen this kind of
wide-open offense since the days of
Sammy Baugh. Gibbs, offensive
coordinator for Don Coryell last
year at San Diego, brings with him
some wide-open ideas orh how to
move the football and score.

He also has the people. Joe
Washington, acquired from Balti-
more, could be the best trade acqui-
sition ofthe season; Running behind
John Riggins, who decided to end
his one-year holdout, Washington
could be a devastating runner and
pass receiver.

‘U
.5-

Dwight Collins will line up at sevéral positions, including tailback, in addition to-his
customary flanker position, according to Coach Jackie Sherrill

Joe Theismann will be the quar-
terback, and the fiery Notre Dame
grad has one potential superstar to
throw to-—Art Monk. All-Rookie,
Monk is All-Pro material, and
Gibbs will use him as a wingback to
take advantage of running ability.

The most improved part of the
Redskin team could be its offensive
line, which will be anchored by two
Pitt rookies, Mark May and Russ
Grimm. Both have looked excep-
tional in preseason, and if they can

. get by their inexperience in the NFL,

the Skins’
explosive.
The Washington defense is solid:

offense should be

‘it has one of the best secondaries in

football and a good,young lineback-
ing corps.

Gibbs will make his regular sea-
son coaching debut against Dallas,
so the Redskins will have an oppor-
tunity to show just how improved
they really are. My guess is that their
showing will be a successful one. A
wild card is within reach.

3. Philadelphia: The NFC chainps
have taken a sharp decline.

The retirement of guard Woody
Peoples is going to hurt as the offen-

_sive line has not looked good in pre-

season. Eagle coach Dick Vermeil is
trying to cajole Peoples out of retire-
ment; it spells touble when the head
coach has to ask a 36-year-old offen-
sive lineman to return to the football
field. I

The injury to Philadelphia’s
Leroy Harris is crucial. Harris, the
blocking back for Wilbert Mont-
gomery, will be sorely missed. As of
yet, Vermeil has found nobody to
replace him. _

Philadelphia’s best bet lies with its
defense, which is solid all the way
around.\

The Eagles‘ problem will be put-
ting points on the board. Unless an
offensive line and a blocking back
can be dug up, the Eagles will be a
big disappointment. ,

4. St. Louis: Not too much here.
The Cardinals have a great running
back in Anderson and not much
else. .

Jim Hart is still a capable quarter-
back, but his offensive line is not,
and Hart was never much of a
scrambler.

A fourth-place finish for the
Cards—they’re still some years away
from contention.

5. N. Y. Giants: The Giants may
have the worst offense in football.
With Billy Taylor and Bo Mathews
as their running backs and Ernest
Gray and Danny Pittman as their
receivers, the Giants are playing
with unknowns. Phil Simms, a tal-
ent who could be good if not great,
gets miiiimal protection from his
line and little production from
skilled position.

The Giants could keep some
games close thanks to'an above-
average defense. Pitt rookie Bill

ass; Scramble inAFC

Neill is the starting middle guard,

.which was a surprise, and the two

ends, Gary Jeter and George Mar-
tin, are both quick and strong. The
linebackers could be the best in foot-

_ ball with Harry Carson, Brad Van

Pelt, Brian Kelley and soon-to-be-
All-Pro Lawrence Taylor, a rookie.
The Giants will finish last, and
there will be no joy in the Big
Applewor the Meadowlands.

NFC CENTRAL

. l. Tampa Bay: In the worst div-
ision in football the Buccaneers
should prevail, thanks to a very
good defense and an offense that
could also be very good.

The Bucs slumped last year, but
the linebacking is strong with the
acquisition of Hugh Green, and the
front three, led by Leroy Selmon, is

tough time scoring against the Bucs.

The offense has some good play-

field, and’ Jimmy Giles, Gordon

  Bad Plans Cause Bucs’Fall

.edition looked so

By AMIN GHOSSEIN »
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pittsburgh Pirates had just
won the World Series, having beaten
the Orioles in an exciting seven-
game struggle. The team and the city

ebulliently proclaimed the’80s to be

the sole property of the Battlin’
Bucs. After all, had not the I979
invincible; so
tough in the clutch, so physically
and mentally tough that a prediction
of such magnitude did not seem out
of line. ‘

So what happened? It’s 1981 and
the once-proud Buccos are mired in
last place. Their play has been down-
right awful even though their start-
ing eight is by no means the worst in
the league. The Pirates are fading
away and, as the recent trades of
Phil Garner and Grant Jackson
seem to indicate, the management is
fully aware that something has to be

I done, and fast, if_the Pirates are to

become contenders again,

A bad Pirate team-could be disas-
trous to the management. Even
when they won, they never drew well
in the stands. A losing Pirate team
could set attendance records on the
negative side. But why has this team

, which two years ago was the toast of
l970s suddenly threaten to

the
become league doormats?

One answer can be supplied by a
look around the American and
National Leagues. The Pirates once

considered a shrewd organization

withsmart management and a fine
minor league system, have turned
just the opposite. Some of the best

v—G

talent in the Pirate systems were

"traded away. Look at the Oakland
As, who have Rick Langford, Tony L

Armas, Mitchell Page and used to
have MigueI’Dilonc, now with the
Indians. All four came in trade for
Phil Garner.

The current leading hitter in U16
American League, Richie Zisk, and
Al Oliver are ﬂourishing with their
new teams and the players they wee
traded for are long gone. Zlsk was
traded for Goose Gossage, Wh0m
the Pirates let go to free agency. Bert
Blyleven, who came to Pittsburgh
on the Oliver deal. was let go for a

 very small price.

Eddie Whitson, whom the Pirates
traded away for Bill Madlock. their
best trade in recent years, is now a
tough righ”t;hand’er who;a'lppeargs to

i be. headedcfor goodfthi.ng's."gRf—i'yck

 

 

Honeycutt, 8-3 with Texas and an

All-Star with Seattle two years ago,
was once in the Pirate organization.
But, possibly the team’s worst

trade ever was the cW’illie Randolph.
. for the Doc Medich deal. Randolph

is now a premier second baseman
with the New York Yankees. The list
goes on and on.

The Pirates have sapped their
young talent in the minors for some
established talent. The system is
woefully weak withthe top prospect
being Doe Boyland, a'26-year-old
injury-prone first baseman with a lot
of minor league experience and so
far, little major league exposure.

The I979 season happens once in‘

a long while. Willie Stargell got a
great year out of his aging body, Phil
Garner and Tim Foli hit in the high
.200s and Madlock was stolen from
the ﬁGiants. Moreno hit .280 and
Tekulve and Jackson got everybody

out. Everyone on the team appeared
to be on top of their game and at the
peak of their career. It’s unlikely to
occur again. - ,

When thesame players tried to.do
it again, they faded because of age
and injuries and there was no young
talent to help them out. Now that the
minor le_ague system is in“ shambles,

‘it seems the only way Handing Peter-

son expects to strengthen his ball-
club is through trades. As far as the
Pirates are concerned, there are few
untouchables.

Tony "Pena, the hard—hitting roo-
kie catcher is one and centerfielder
Omar Moreno is another. Dale
Berra will get a shotat second base,
as will Johnny Ray, recently
acquired in the Garner trade. The
pitching staff is old~Jim Bibby is
aging, and Tekulve is old and incon-
sistent. Tekulve has pitched much
better in the second season, but the
bullpen on the whole has not been
reliable. The Pirates are in trouble,
and the answer will not be found in
their system. The trade route is the
only sensible solution and to get tal-
ent they will have to give up talent.-

CFA follow-up...

The p-resident of Penn State Uni- .

versity says he will vote to approve a
television contract between NBC
and the Collegiate Football Associa-
tion.when memberschools meet next
week to ratify-the contract. ' _

Dr. John _W. Oswald made the
disclosure in a letter tovchancellors
and presidents of other CFA schools
that was made public by Penn State
Tuesday. I

The CFA schools, composed of
many major college football powers
in the country, excluding the Big 10
and Pacific 10 Conferences, voted
by a 3-2 margin Aug.2l to accept the
$180‘-million dollar pact with NBC.
Oswald said he approved the con-
tract then and would reaffirm.the
vote when the final ballot is taken
Sept. I0.

With Joe Paterno, Penn State
football coach and athletic director,
as one of the CFA’s leading suppor-
ters, it seems Penn State and Oswald
made'the announcement in an effort
to exert some leadership with the
CFA as schools wrestle their final
decisions about the contract. The
final vote is supposed to be a secret
ballot.

The NCAA has threatened to
punish any school that goes along
with the CFA-NBC package rather
than its own $263.5 million contract
with ABC and CBS to televise foot-
ball games from 1982-85. The CFA

deal runs concurrently with the

NCAA package.

The NCAA insists that it ‘has the
rights to negotiate TV contracts for
its menibers andthat any school vot-
ing for the CFA plan is subject to
disciplinary action. Oswald, along
with the CFA, disagreed. ‘

“The question is not whether we
intend to stay in the NCAA but
whether our property rights on tele-
vision, cable casting and like media
are going to be protected," Oswald
wrote to his colleagues.

The CFA publicly has scoffed at‘
NCAA threats of disciplinary
action, pointing out that its
members are among a large group of

the NCAA’s strongest members.

aren't too many better quarterbacks
in the NFL. But when he’s bad, look

hurt, however, are Jack Reynolds

be solid, especially now that Wen-
dell Tyler is fully healthy.

Illinois returns its top two receiv-
ers from I980, junior Mike Martin
(33 receptions) and ‘senior John
Lopez (32 receptions), along’with a
heralded newcomer, wide receiver
Oliver Williams. The offensive line
also returns mainly intact and aver-

“Four of their five starters are

The lllini’s penchant for multiple

son preparations, hoping the offen-
sive team can execute successfullv
enough to ease the pressure on the
Panthers’ defense.

A worrisome running game in fall
camp. however, could presumably
give the coaches some temporary
amnesia for running plays unless
someone emerges soon. Fullback
Wayne DiBartola, as always, has
been steady, but no one so far has
stood out at tailback, where sopho-
more Joe McCall will start.

Also a concern to Sherrill is the

‘lack of'work quarterback Dan

Marino and flanker Dwight Collins
had in the closing days of fall camp.
Both players missed much ofthe last
week. ‘

“With Danny out, ,we didn‘t have
the chance to do a lot ofthings we'd
have liked. Right now we're behind
offensively,“ Sherrill said. "It will
make usido a lot of thingsdiffer-
ently. We’d be in the shotgun by
now.” ‘ - '

Sherrill hinted that the offensive
has been able to work in a few new
wrinkles in time to showcase Collins
in more ways than just his custom-
ary ﬂanker spot.

“We plan to use Collins in a lot of
different positions Saturday,” said

n ‘Up in Air’

’ Sherill, specifically mentioning half-

back. “Dwight will line up in the
backfield and run the ball.” Also
look for Collins to line up at wing-
back periodically, as the Panthers
try to isolate him in one-on-one pass
coverage.

“Last year,.they had a problem in
the secondary matching up one-on-
one with (Anthony) Carter from
Michigan and (Rick) Donnalley
from Ohio State," Sherill said.
“We’re anxious to see if they can
match-up one-on-one with Collins.”

Make that anxious and hoping.

SherilI’s also hoping that his team
emerges from the game without any
serious injuries to test its depth,
which is thin, and without any
breakdowns on defense, which is
green. In general, he's hoping the
team is adequately prepared to start
the season.

“In the long run, we hope it (mov-
ing up the game) was the best thing
to_do," Sherill said.

Which is like hoping your car
starts when you’re stuck on the rail-
road tracks, with a train whistling
around the corner.

Thei‘Dolphins are not stacked, but

Shula’s teams don’t make mistakes, &

The running backs are good but
untested.‘ Vagas Ferguson is impres-
sive' but still young, while Don Cal-
houn is solid. A great offensive line
led by John Hannah gives Grogan
all day, but he seems to prefer run-
..ning rather than passing.

linebacker, where Steve Nelson has

\ been hurt often and a_ couple of roo-

kies are currently starting. ’
’ Another disappointment in

Roger Carr, and QB Jones can get
the ball to anybody.

Look for the Colts to ride as long
as Jones can sling them.

5. N. Y. Jets: A puzzle..New York
has a lot of talent, especially on
offense, where Richard Todd has
Wesley Walker and Johnny Lam
Jones. The running attack should be
good, especially with rookie Free-
man McNeil. The defense is oh, so
weak, however, and the schedule is
too tough.

AFC CENTRAL

_ l. Cleveland: By a nose. A great
offense ‘with terrific group of
receivers.

The Browns are one of the best
teams to watch, they gamble and
they're daring.

Brian Sipe isjust perfect in his role
as Cleveland quarterback." He’ll
challenge»-anyone, and usually he
wins. The defense has a lot of heart
and rises up to the occasion. If
Robert L. Jackson can stay healthy,
he could be All-Pro.

2. Pittsburgh: The Steelers are
strong but are not close to what they
once were. The running backs are
untested, and Franco Harris is get-
ting old. The receivers are the best in

football, and quarterback Terry
Bradshaw, if hungry. could be
awesome.

The problem is on defense, where
the Steelers must develop a rush.
Otherwise, the secondary will get
abused like he did last year.

4. Cincinatti: Some talent, espe-
cially on defense, but the running
backs are untested and the organiza-
tion is horrible.

AFC WEST

I. Oakland: The Super Bowl was
no fluke _last year. Ted Hendricks
was the most dominating defensive
player in the game and Jim Plunkett

was gutsy at quarterback. This is a‘

solid team that knows what it takes
to win.

The Raiders will win this division,
and they could have an easier time
than most people might think.

' 2. San Diego: The all—pass philo-

'sophy has not brought a title to San

Diego, and it won't this year, either
with Chuck Muncie in the backfield,
Coach Don must use him on the
ground, or else it would be a waste.
Not having John Jefferson might
sway his mind just a little bit.

3, Denver: Craig Morton ‘is more
suited to retirement than carrying an
offense. I

4. Kansas City: lt’s about time
Marv Levy’s squad starts to do
something. There is talent on this
squad, but injuries to Steve Fuller
and Bill Kenney hurt this team.

No better than third place.

5. Seattle: Jim Zorn will have to
do a lot of scrambling ifthis team is
to do anything.

ANNOUNCING THREE NEW
ARMY NATIONAL GUARD
PROGRAMS THAT CAN HELP

‘ YOU PAY FOR COLLEGE. V 7

If you're like many col-
lege students, the closer you
get to your degree, the deeper
you get intodebt. But, you
don't have to get in over your -
head. Not when ,ou join the
Army National uard.

1‘ Because now, the Guard
has three new programs to
hel you pay for college: the
Co ege Loan Repayment Pro
gram; the Educational

Assistance Program, and the
Enlistment Bonus ram.
And you don't have to wait for
graduation to take advantage
of them. You could join the
Guard right now.

You see, the Army Na-
tional Guard is part-time. After
your initial training, it takes
Just two days a month and two

. weeks of annual training a

year to serve. So there's plenty
of time left for your studies.
And you get paid for every
hour you put into the Guard,
so you'll have extra cash for
books, lab fees, and all those
other little expenses that
come up ;

. 0 course, there's more
to the Guard than money. It's a
chance to do somethin good

. for your country, as weﬂ as for

people right in your own com-

The Guard is

munity. The Guard can give .
you more options in your life-
and more control over your
financial future.
If that sounds like where

you want to be, see your ﬁ- .
nancial aidoﬁicer, contact
your local Army National
Guard recruiter, or use the toll-
free number below for com-
plete details on how the Guard
can hel you ay for college.
And he p in-a ot of other
ways, too. But hu ! These
special programs or college
students are available for a
limited time only.
