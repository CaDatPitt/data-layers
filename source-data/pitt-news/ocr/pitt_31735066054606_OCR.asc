Kappa

Sigma, Pitt  

meet again

Erin Lindeman
Senior Staff Writer

University oﬂicials and the Kappa
Sigma fraternity met Wednesday afternoon
to conﬁrm what both parties already knew
— the fratemity is living oﬁ campus and
violating a policy saying it must live on
campus to be recognized by the Inter-
Fratemity Council. '

This is the second hearing in a month.
The first was declared a mistrial because
the fraternity was charged under the wrong
code, according to Kappa Sigma President
Nick Moraites.

’ The University is expected to decide
within seven to 10 days what action it will

' take against the fraternity, according to

Kappa Sigma Alumnus Adviser Mark
Okrutny. _

Under University policy, Pitt ofﬁcials
are not allowed to speak speciﬁcally about
the trial until a decision has been made.

Kappa Sigma is violating a University
policy and was originally charged for vio-
lating the rule under the Student Code of
Conduct

But under the Student Code of
Conduct, only individuals can be tried for
allegations, not an entire organization.

Dennis Donham, assistant vice chan-
cellor of student affairs, said that if an orga-
nization 'was charged under the Student
Code of Conduct and he was asked to
declare a mistrial after the hearing, A he
would do so.

Donham said if this situation were to “

take place, the group would have another
hearing with the same charges, only this
time “under the correct code.” A

A group or organization on campus
would be charged under codes within the
Office of Student Activities. But a Greek
organization would be handled.» by the
Inter-Fraternity Council or by the
Panhellenic Association or, depending on
the severity of the charge, by the Tribunal
Council. a

The Tribunal Council consists of a
hearing panel of three individuals. Greek
adviser Kerrie Daley, coordinator of the
hearing, and Joseph Cavalla, director of
student activities, oversee the hearing. ,

Moraites said the second hearing was

Test hurts minority students, study shows

Lori White

For The Pitt News

Top minority students score lower than
their white counterparts on the Law School
Admission Test, according to a study by a
California company.

a Testing for the Public, a non-proﬁt edu-
cation research group based in Berkeley,
Calif., reported recently» that top minority
graduates’ scores are affected by racial bias
in the LSAT, which claims to predict fu
performance in law school. ’ ' _

Testing for the Public Director David
M. White informed the Texas House of

Representatives Committee on Higher"
Education about the. dramatic score dilfer-g

ences on the LSAT. -
White told legislators,_ “Students ﬁom
ﬁve elite colleges -—— Harvard, Yale,

- Stanford, UC—Berkeley and UCLA — earn

very different scores on. the Law School
Admissions Test if they are ﬁ'om different
racial groups, even when they are matched
only with students with the same grades
from the same college.”

Conclusions of the study were based on
applicants ﬁom the ﬁve colleges who were
all applying to Boalt Hall School of Law at
the ' University of Califomia-Berkeley
between 1996 and 1998.

Students from each minority group
were matched with those in a group of white
students from the same college. The stu-
dents involved maintained a four—year
undergraduate grade point average that was
nearly identical, plus or-minus .10 on a 4.0
scale. ‘ V .

Results of the study show gaps in scores
ranging from 9.30 in the African-American

group to 2.48 points in the Asian group.
White said the purpose of the study was
to give assurance to top minority students

‘I thatifﬂieyaredisappointed with their LSAT
score, they are not alone. He said lower

scores by minority students ‘ represent a
national trend that has been documented for
more than 20 years.

White said he also wanted to help
admissions oﬂicers who seek fairness and a

‘diverse atmosphere for all applicants.

“Comparing LSACI‘ scores without rec-
ognizing the signiﬁcant average gap
between -groups appears to be fair,” he said
“But [the LSAT] actually penalized the very
minority-group students who have already
demonstrated their academic skill in top col-
leges.”

Screams Fresh! PITT/OAKLAND/SHADYSIDE/BLOOMFIELD

Staff Writer

The everyday ironies of All My
Children’s Erica Kane will come to
the Pitt campus with the melodrama of
Pitt student life.

Rainbow Alliance will put a new
twist on the soap opera when it airs
“Abundant Life” at 8:30 p.m. in 203
David Lawrence Hall. The main
character, FiFi Tyler, who is played by
drag queen Freedom DeFury, is a 20-
year-old woman who grew up without
parents and is trying to make it on her
own. i

The citizens of the town are. gays
and straights who live in the make-
believe town of Roseville, R.I.

“No one knows anyone is gay
until the second episode,” said
Rainbow Alliance Public Relations
Chair Stephen Fugge, a Pitt sopho-
more. ~

Homosexuality is not the main
theme, added Fugge. It’s just the'sub-
plot, and everyone is welcome.

Fugge‘ created the soap opera
when he was a teenager. He wrote just
the outline of each episode, so when
the actors play their parts, they have

the freedom to improvise.

He said he never thought about the
outlines until he was trying to attract
more students to Rainbow Alliance.-

“It’s the only thing like it on cam-
pus, and it appeals to everyone,” said
Fugge. “There are gays and straights
in the movie, and they all have differ-
ent issues that they deal with.”

Fugge said the scenes are set all

over the Pitt campus with an ironic
twist to them.

“In the hospital scene, you see
Benedum Hall as the front and the
William Pitt Union as the inside,”
added Fugge.

The soap opera will air every
Thursday night in Room 203 of David
Lawrence. Admission is free, and the
shows usually last about 15 minutes ,
said Fugge, although the debut will
last a half hour. A

“Every episode leaves off at a
cliffhanger to make people come
back,” said Fugge.

He added that he wanted people to
get a sense of morals and enjoyment.

“I want to hear people talking
about the show like it’s a real soap
opera,” said Fugge, “Like ‘Oh did you
see what FiFi did this week?”’ ‘

National tuition hikes clouble current inflation

Sean Madigan

Minnesota Daily

MINNEAPOLIS, Minny (U-
WIRE) — The average annual in-state
tuition rate rose 4 percent nationally
this year, more than twice the rate of
inﬂation, according to a survey
released by the College Board.

To calculate last year’s inﬂation
rate, the College Board used the
Consumer Price Index, which rose 1.6
percent for the 12 months ending in
August.

University of Minnesota under-
graduates pay $1,025 more than the
national average in tuition and fees for
four—year public universities, accord-
ing to the survey released late last
week. The average tuition for all
undergraduate freshmen at Minnesota
is $4,458 and is slated to rise by an
average of 3 percent to $4,577 for next
year, said Tom Gilson, a senior analyst
for the Office of Planning and
Analysis.

Last year, undergraduate students
paid an average of $4,268 for tuition
and fees; that amount increased‘ by an
average of 3 percent this year.

“The average is 3 percent, but the
actual dollar amount might be more
for some students and less for others,
depending on the tuition structure,”
said Richard Pfutzenreuter, vice presi-
dent of the Office of Budget and
Finance. Upper— and lower—division
students pay different amounts.
Tuition costs also depend on the num-
ber of credits a student takes.

Minnesota’s average tuition and
fees rank sixth among the 11 schools

in the Big Ten. Northwestern is the’

most expensive, charging students
more than $22,392 in tuition and fees
annually.

Despite this year’s increase falling
one percentage point short of the
national average, Minnesota Student
Association president Nikki Kubista
said she is not pleased with the tuition
rate. A

“Each year, the students ask to
keep the tuition low, and each year the
University raises it a little, not neces-
sarily outrageously, but just enough
that students are less likely to mobi-
lize around the change,” Kubista said.

The association is currently lobby-
ing the Board of Regents to hold the
annual tuition increase to no more
than 2 percent. Each year that tuition
increases, the Minnesota becomes less
accessible to students in need, Kubista
said. 8

“This is a trend, that we slowly
increase tuition, but what are we get-
ting?” asked Kubista. Many of the
things students are getting are things
they should have already had, Kubista
said.

     

Pfutzenreuter said the tuition and
fees increase should not be compared
to the inﬂation rate but rather to what
goods and services the Minnesota pro-
vides to students. When the amount of
goods and services expands, more dol-
lars are needed for funding, he said.

Of the Minnesota’s $1.28 billion
dollar budget request, 94 percent of
what Minnesota President Mark Yudof
calls “the basket of goods” is being
funded by the state. Only 6 percent of
the funding for goods and services
comes from tuition dollars,
Pfutzenreuter said.

In years that tuition has increased,
the state and federal governments

 

wire

have supplemented the increases by
adding additional funding,

Pfutzenreuter said.

  Crime bill won’t help

U. Penn officials say

Ben Geldon
Dally Pennsylvanian

PHILADELPHIA, Penn. (U—~

WIRE) — A new federal law
designed to make colleges safer by
giving students and

prospective students a fuller pic-
ture of campus crime will probably
fail to accomplish its goals,
University officials maintain.

The law — part of the far—reach-
ing Higher Education Act which
President Clinton" signed into law
last Wednesday — seeks‘ to expand
what crimes colleges and universi-

ties must report to its students and _

the federal government.
In the past, schools could claim
that many campus crimes occurred

‘ in places that were technically “off

campus,” as defined by a 1990 law.
Earlier this year, aiyear-long U.S.
Department of
Education investi-
gation cleared

that itgwas inten-
tionally underre-
porting campus
crime statistics.

The new law
attempts to close
that loophole by
requiring colleges
and universities to
report crimes that
happenin

areas designated
as “non-campus,”
like fraternity
houses or other
buildings used by
student organiza-
tions, and “public property,” which
includes streets and sidewalks run-
ning through campus. _

Proponents of the law say it will
make current students more knowl-
edgeable about campus crime and
thus better able to protect them-
selves, while enabling prospective

 

, students to make an informed deci-

sion about where to go to school.
Penn’s top crime—fighting offi-
cial, however, said that while he
agrees with ‘-‘the concept of crime-
reporting,” the new bill probably

won’t make campuses safer-
“Crime reporting is important
and ought to continue,’_? said
University Vice President for
Public Safety Tom Seamon.-“I just

He Said

think that this legislation, an effort
to make the original bill better, may
have the opposite effect.”

He explained that the law will
now require the University “to
devote personnel and money in
equipment to do the crime report-
ing,” resources that could otherwise
be used to fight crime directly.

But Daniel Carter, the vice—presi—

dent of Security On Campus Inc., a _
non-profit group that lobbied exten-

sively for the «

new legislation, termedthat argu- A

ment “a bogus criticism.”

“The reporting burdens are not
that much higher,” he said, adding
that the information should be at
hand anyway

because “you can’t adequately
assign your campus. security
resources if you don’t know what’s
going on or what’s
happening.”

And John
Ullyot, deputy
chief of staff to
Sen. Arlen Specter
(R—Pa.), the law’s
sponsor, said the
crime-reporting is
“a worthwhile
endeavor... even if
it increases the
effort.” "

“It does
increase the burden
on the university,”.
Ullyot said. “But
that doesn’t neces-
sarily have to come
out of the
portion of the bud-
get that the university places on
maintaining a secure campus.”

Seamon also questioned
whether students review crime sta-
tistics at all, saying that perceptions
of safety are based more on a few
major but largely unavoidable ran-
dom crimes — like shootings -4
than on everyday thefts and bur-
glaries. ~~

But Ullyot disagreed. _

“Having accurate statistics, giv-
ing students and their families the
most accurate picture possible,
enables those students and their
families... to make the right deci-
sions about how best to protect
themselves against such crimes,” he
said. '

TEST

White suggests the gap may come
from the method used to maintain consis-
tency with the scores. Questions are thrown
out based on a negative or positive correla-
tion with a score. If a group of low—sco1ing
students gets a particular question right and
a high—scoring group gets that same ques-
tion wrong, it is thrown out to maintain con-
sistency.

Jason Willis, president of Pitt’s Black
Law Students Association, said he isn’t sur-
prised by the ﬁndings.

“T1rnes really haven’t changed that
much since the implementation of aﬁinna-
tive action in the 1960s,” he said. "The
LSAT happened to be a barometer of that
Aﬂiimative action is now being dissolved;

 reference to aﬂinnative action
can be seen in the fact that in ‘November
1996, California voters adopted Proposition
209, which declares the state shall not dis-
criminate against or grant preferential treat-
ment to any individual or group on the basis
of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national ori-
gin in the operation of public education or
public contracting. ‘

Many BLSA members said they think
the conclusion of the study goes deeper than
the LS/XI‘. They said they feel it begins early
in school and that standardized testing
across the board has yielded similar results.

White said that since the United States
is a nation with a past marred by racial prej-
udice, he thinks minority students are treat-
ed less fairly.

“Students should be judged by what
they have done, not what they are predicted
to do,” White said.

Racial biases
may have made
a test to become
a law student
harder for
Nicole Fisher
and Yvonne
Sallis to pass
than for white
students.

When Nathan Davis wanted to join

his high-school band in the ‘50s, the

director already had too -many people
playing saxophone, the instrument
Davis had been studying for three
years.

' So Davis asked the director what
instrument the band needed. When the
director replied that he needed a trom-
bone player, Davissaid, “Well, I’ll get
one.” J

Davis ran to a friend’s house that
day to borrow a trombone that had been
tucked away in the garage. It was so

.beaten—up that Davis had to soak it in

the bathtub to cleangthe grime and tape
the keys so he could play it.

He played the battered old trom-
bone until the director offered a new
one to whoever could play a piece the
best.

“So I played the shit out of that

apiece, and I got the trombone,” said

Davis.

Davis is now the director of Pitt’s
jazz studies program and a profession-
al musician; he has a room full of
dozens of instruments — from two gui-
tars and a trumpet to a piano and an
oboe. ’ V ,

“You walk in there, and it looks
like a music store,” said Davis.

Among the rows of instruments are
his saxophones — Davis’ principle
instrument and the one he used to
become a- world-renowned musician
and pioneer of jazz education.-

After two years as the artistic A

director for the awards ceremonies sur-
rounding it, Davis was recently induct-
ed into the International Jazz Hall of
Fame. The honor is given to jazz musi-
cians for their lifetime ‘ accomplish-
ments. ,

The Hall of Fame now recognizes
Davis as part of a pool of great musi-
cians that includes John Coltrane,
Horace Silver, Ray Charles, Count
Basie and Kenny Clarke. _

Davis has been involved in music
his whole life, playing several instru-
ments throughout high school and col-
lege and going on to play and teach at
music schools in Europe,

He came to Pitt 27 years ago after
the University interviewed numerous

  Piﬂ professor dev

people to teach in its newly fonned jazz
music program.

Almost every inch of his small
ofﬁce in the music building is covered
with images of jazz music — from the
collage of jazz musicians hanging in
the comer to the copy of John “Dizzy”
Gillespie’s Groovin’ High album rest-
ing on the ledge of the small piano at
the door.“ ~

And among the great jazz legends
whosephotos and music fill the room,
Davis’ name pops up again and again.

Davis’ involvement in jazz did not
begin with his. teaching the history of
jazz at Pitt. In fact, his involvement
began near the beginning of jazz histo-
ry: ‘Davis was one of the ﬁrst men to
study and teach jazz.

Davis grew up in Kansas City,
Kan., with his mother, a “semi-profes-
sional” singer. She performed at
churches, teas and conventions.

Every time Davis went to visit his

father, who was ‘divorced from Davis’ ’

mother, his father said, “I want you to
listen to this.” He then played one of
his large collection of Jazz at the
Philharmonic and Nat King Cole
records.

“He really was a jazz nut,” said
Davis. “I mean, he had everything.”

When he was 15, Davis listened to
a neighboring Methodist minister and
jazz buff’s record of Coleman

 

DAN 3AUDER/ STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

 

 

Hawkins, the first great musician to
introduce saxophone to the world.

While Hawkins’ sound emanated
from the record player, the minister
said to Davis, “You wanna play the
sax?” When Davis answered yes, the
minister replied, “Then you gotta get a
sound like this.” 

Davisworked day after day in a jit-
ney — a taxi cab answering service —
for $7.50 a week to save for the down
payment on a saxophone.

He finally got a Silvertone sax
from a Sears and Roebuck catalog, and
though he started learning the instru-
ment at the late age of 16, it didn’t take
him long at all to catch on.

“Within about two weeks, I .was
playing in clubs,” said Davis.

Soon afterward, his mother sent
him to a music school, the Kansas City
Conservatory. Since jazz music, and
especially the saxophone, weren’t
accepted in society at that time, Davis
studied clarinet.

A In the spring of his junior year of
high school, Davis and a piano player
he knew entered a music contest and
won first place. Davis went home and
told his mother, “I’m quitting school
and going to Chicago to play music.”

Davis went to Chicago, stayed with
relatives, and went to Crane Tech High
School. In most of his spare time, he
played in night clubs until December of
that year, when he moved back home to
finish high school in Kansas City.

» When Davis returned home, he
brought with him a new ‘knowledge of
music, gained from experience in
Chicago. In addition to the saxophone
and the clarinet, he began to study
other instruments, including the trom-

’ bone in the band.

Davis hoped to finally be formally
trained on the saxophone when he went
to college, but when he walked into the
audition for the music school holding
his saxophone, the man he was audi-
tioning for said, “What are you gonna
do with that?” Davis replied, “I’m
gonna play it.” The auditioner said,
“No you’re not.”

Jazz music and the saxophone still
weren’t accepted in high society, and
Davis’ love for music led him to major
in another instrument in the reed fami-
ly, one he had only a year of training in
—‘ the clarinet. , _

“I had to practice my butt off

because I wasn’t used to clarinet,” he -

said.

Davis involved himself in musical
ensembles within the school, including
the marching band and the symphony
orchestra. In each group, he tried to
play a different instrument.

But though he played other instru-
ments, Davis really wanted to learn
more “sax. So he played outside of

playing “with three girls singing up
front.”

“We used to pack it, you know,”
said Davis.

Davis‘ was drafted into the Army

after college and went to the Navy_

School of Music, where he taught
courses and “went jammin’ every night
in D.C.” , ‘

The music didn’t stop when he was
sent to Berlin while in the service. He
played in a bar one night with Russian,
British and American musicians out-
side the Berlin Wall. That night, he
played for a drunk audience of troops
and Charlton Heston.

“I said to myself, ‘Wait.
Something’s wrong here with this.pic-
ture,”’ said Davis.

After" he was discharged, Davis
stayed in Berlin playing in clubs. After
a while, Kenny Clarke, a jazz drummer

and expatriate whom Davis met while 

in Europe, invited Davis to teach music
composition and improvisation in Paris
at the Paris-American Academy of
Music.

After years in Paris, Davis was
asked to come to Pitt. He declined
three times, and Clarke said to him,
“You should really go, man. That
would be a milestone for jazz.”

After taking advice from many
musicians who told him that jazz need-
ed people like him — musicians with
academic degrees — to work in educa-
tion, he finally moved to Pittsburgh.
Here he helped the jazz curriculum

Marriage classes should turn
around divorce rate

The New York Times reported
yesterday that hundreds of
American high schools are offering
classes — some for two weeks,
some for a whole semester — on
how to make marriage work.

Two weeks to a ‘ semester?
Sounds like the length of most real
marriages.

The idea of taking a marriage
class in high school, in an America

' with a divorce rate of over 50 per-

cent, is a good idea if the course is
offered as an elective, such as the
one offered at Martin Luther King
High School in Philadelphia.

However, requiring such a
class would create a whole set of
problems. For a start, marriage is
not required of any high schooler.
Since it’s a good idea as an elective,
it should not be forced on them, as
students will most likely lose inter-
est.

Conservatives, liberals, leftists
and right-wingers all agree that

' marriage is not something to be

taken lighﬂy. Though these groups
are bickering about whether the

class should focus more on health ,

or religious or socioeconomic
issues, they‘ all agree that a class
like this should be offered in every
high school’s curriculum._

In California, several hundred
schools use the _15-lesson
“Connections” program; students
select a partner for a pretend mar-
riage, and for seven days they meet
to divide household duties, plan a
wedding and discuss career choic-
es. In essence, “Connections”

teaches high schoolers to deal with ‘

the “little” issues that can either
make or break a marriage.

With the current staggering
divorce rate, anything to help com-
bat this trend is well worth trying.
By teaching high school students
communication skills, even if it is
in the form of a mock marriage,
educators could be helping
teenagers overcome the difﬁculties
that have become reasons for
divorce.

Though courses are not likely
to teach students how to commit
adultery or use the “Kama Sulra” as
a required text, they should stress
the points that many feel make a
marriage work — communication,
the will to resolve problems, and
respect for the other person’s opin-
ron.

If these classes help turn
around the divorcerate, every high
school in the country would do well

' to offer them as an elective.

Take pride in your vandalism

I admit that I am not one who subscribes to

many beliefs. I try not to decide my stance on

controversies, instead attempting to be objective.
One thing that truly bothers me, however, is the
lack of creativity, originality and Puritan work
ethic demonstrated by those surrounding me
when proclaiming their beliefs.

This year, as well as last, the Students for
Life group exhibited its Cemetery of Irmocence,
a memorial to those individuals cut down in the
prime of life by abortion. The display was meant
to proclaim the travesty of cell tissue prevented
from becoming positive members of society, let
alone members of the new baby club.

The display’s neat rows of white wooden
crosses caught the attention of passersby. The
group’s feelings were stated simply, the symbol-
ism strong and easily understood. Obviously, the
168 crosses took time and hard work to plant

Last year’s exhibit was ripped
apart by someone who’ disagreed
Crosses were scattered and broken. I
was horriﬁed that someone would do
something like this; such a poorly
plarmed, half—hearted attempt to
show his anger and disagreement

I thoughtat the time, “Well, what does that
mean? ‘Me angry! Me knock down!”’ Iﬁgured
the act would have made a much’ larger'state-
ment had he taken the time to dangle wire coat
hangers on each cross, perhaps to symbolize the

women ‘who have died or been injured attempt-

ing to perform their own abortions. I mean, let’s
think before we act, right? The vandal who was
arrested by neither the Pitt Police nor the “good
idea police” could have learned a lot ﬁ'om an

, incident involving the Columbus statue in

Schenley Park Earlier that samemonth, a group
of individuals angry with Columbus celebrated
Columbus Day by pelting the 50-foot. bronze
monument with red paint-ﬁlled glass bulbs.

They also ‘painted the words “Murderer!” and ,

“Stolen Land!” on the artwork.

From the brand-new statement of protest,
viewers glimpsed the anger many people feel
toward the explorer. They were reminded‘ that
Columbus was not just an explorer who acci-
dentally found a continent, but also a, man who
brought death and disease to the Native
Americans. Never mind that Galileo proved the
earth’s spherical shape centuries before or that he
mistakenly called them ‘ dians” —- a name still

insultingly used today: Covered in blood,
Columbus was seen for the savage man he was.

Last year, during National Coming Out
Week, the streets and sidewalks of Pitt’s campus
were covered with pro-gay acceptance ,mes—
sages. Blurbs such as “If you’re smiling, you
might be gay?’ and “Be proud to be gay” were
scrawled in chalk during one night. .

Though the messages lacked the perma-
nence of previous years’ spray paint, the point
came across: “You or someone you know may
be gay. They’re no diﬁerent from anyone else.”

Another event during the week was “Gay
Jeans Day,” a very effective, but thoroughly mis-
understood attempt to further make the point
The day’s premise, explained in many ﬂiers and
signs, was to show "pride or support for those
coming out through the wearing of a normal, all-
American piece of clothing: jeans.

0 The cries of anguish and
angry shouts rang beautiﬁrlly in my
ears. No matter what anyone wore,
they were forced to drink about the
event. They were forced to under-
- stand that everyone wears jeans and
that if there were similarities so esoteric between
those of differing sexual persuasions, they must
extend further. They were forced to either make
a statement or 111151 around naked And closed-
minded individuals are rarely such fun.

But those who disagreed, those who felt
homosexuality was wrong" knew what to do:
They would abstain from wearing jeans.

These people had ﬁnally ﬁgured out how to
ﬁght a symbol. When a symbol offends you,
change it. Don’t like the positive message “Be
yourself’ on the sidewalk? Add the words “a«
monster.” See a cross on a wall? Make it into the

' “t” in “Crist Suks!”. (It is widely known that

atheists can rarely spell.)
Mypoint—protesturmecessary—is that
if you are so angered by someone’s beliefs in
material form, show some eﬂbrt. If you feel you
are capable of handling such heavy subjects as
abortion and race, and that your beliefs are so
much more important than others’, give those
beliefs the respect they deserve and proclaim
them as what you are inside. So if you are a van-
dal at heart, make those who think for you proud.
Otherwise, let the people speak

Chn's Griswold likes seeing stupid people upset.

Coming out against Bilae-inspired Irate

Michael J.

Nlazza

In his 1845 autobiography, former slave
Frederick Douglass offered a blistered

indictment of those slaveholders who used .

their religion to justify slavery and the vio-

lent abuse of slaves in particular. 1
Regarding one master who “found reli-

gious sanction for his cruelty,” Douglass

-recorded the following: “I have seen him tie .

up a lame young woman, and whip her with
a heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders,
causing the warm red blood to drip; and in

justiﬁcation of the bloody deed, he would

quote this passage of Scripture —— ‘He that
knoweth his master’s will, and doeth it not,
shall be beaten with many stripes’ [Luke
12:47].” A '

With this sickening image, Douglass
shattered a central argument of pro-slavery
Christians: the claim that using biblical prin-
ciples as the basis for the slave system would
lead to humane, loving treatment ofAf1ican—
Americans held in bondage. Instead,
Douglass illuminated an important truth:
whenever the Bible is used as a tool to mar-
ginalize or establish a hierarchy over a par-
ticular class of people, violence and blood-
shed inevitably follow.

This terrible truth has manifestedlitself

.over and over again in Christian, history.

Consider the rarnifrcations of Christian
obsession over Exodus 22: 18 — “Thou shalt
not suffer a witch to live.” In their study “The
Bible Tells Me So,” Jim Hill and Rand
Cheadle note that this verse served as justiﬁ—
cation for the imprisomnent, torture and
murder of approximately 300,000 people ———-
mostly women — who were suspected of
witchcraft. -

Even the genocidal orgy of the Nazi \
Holocaust had its roots in Christian preoccu- F A

pation with selectively chosen biblical pas-
sages. In his 1991 book, “Who killed Jesus?
Exposing the Roots of Anti—Semitism in the
Gospel Story of the Death of Jesus,” biblical
scholar John Dominic Crossan suggests that
the Nazi massacre of 6 million.Jews wasthe
logical outcome of centuries of Christian
failure to critically question the anti—Jewish
bias of certain parts of the New Testament.
Crossan’s research eloquently underscores
the '' bold declaration made by African-
American author James Baldwin in his 1963
essay “The Fire Next Time”: ‘The fact of the
Third Reich alone makes obsolete any ques-
tion of Christian superiority.”

This heritage of violence inspired by a
privileged gmup’s interpretation and appli-
cation of the Bible frequently manifests itself
today in attacks upon gay men and lesbians.
In 1986, U.S. Rep. John Conyers Jr. noted
that anti-gay/anti—lesbian violence had
become a national issue in 1979, when open-
ly-gay San Francisco City Supervisor

Harvey Milk was assassinated by a homo-‘

phobic gtmman. Since Milk’s murder, con-

cerned Americans have tried to stem the ti

of violence. -
Unfortunately, gays and lesbians remain

very much at risk nearly 20 years after
Milk’s assassination. Consider the murder of
22-year-old Matthew Shepard, a gay student
at the University of Wyoming. Just last
week, he was savagely beaten, burned, tied
to a fence and left for dead by four attackers.
E.N. Smith of the Associated Press reported
that Shepard’s attackers singled him out for
violence because he was gay and made anti-
gay remarks after the attack

What Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and
other homophobic preachers of the Christian
right don’t seem to realize is that their inces-
sant attacks on the civil rights and human
dignity of lesbians and gays help to create an
environment that fosters this type of vio-
lence. . F

Consider the commentary on Leviticus
20: 13 — which prescribes the death penalty
for sarne-sex intercourse between males —
made by Tim LaHaye in his 1980 book
“What Everyone Should Know About
Homosexuality.” Of this death sentence,
LaHaye writes, ‘This may seem ‘cruel and
inhuman treatment’ by today’s standards, but

our leniency has caused today’s widespread,

problems.” A

LaHaye’s comments notwithstanding,‘

many homophobic Christians today hide
behind the claim that they “love the sinner
but hate the sin.” However, this doublespeak
was morally indefensible in the past and con-
tinues to be so. After all, 19th century slave-
holders claimed that black slaves were loved

by their masters; it was the sir1 of disobedi-
ence, of trying to escape to freedom, that was
hated by those in power.

The Christian right also evades moral

" responsibility for its contribution to anti-gay

violence by claiming that if gays would only

“change” their sexual orientation, they

would no longer be stigmatized. Well, Jews
and Muslims could similarly “change” their
religious orientation through conversion;
does this justify the dangerous Christian
rhetoric that inspired the abuse and murder
of Jews and Muslims during the Inquisition
and the Crusades?

THURSDAY, 15 OCTOBER 1998

Tony Oliva

Columnist

“You’ve got to be kidding me!”

These were the words that sprang forth
ﬁom my mouth when I read last Thursday’s
issueof The Pitt News. There, on the ﬁont
page, was an article stating that the city was
actually considering narrowing Fifth

_ Avenue. Is it crazy or just plain Forrest

Gump stupid (stupid is as stupid does)?

The Department of City Planning is
using money to “study” whether narrowing
the street would improve safety. OK, so it
wants to cut one lane of traffic on Fifth
Avenue and widen the sidewalks with‘ the
extra space. I ﬁnd a couple of things wrong

    llshould besimple: Look

with that idea. .

First, if implemented, a lane of Fifth
Avenue will be cut out. Doesn’t anyone at
the Department of City Planning realize that
the street itself is the dangerous part? If you
remove a lane of traﬂic, that just means there
is less room for cars to drive. That will yield
more aggressive driving for the limited road
space, which.will, in turn, cause more acci-
dents, crashes and injuries. By the way, did-
n’t most of the pedestrians recently hit get
struck by buses? What good will closing
down one of the driving lanes do?

Second, the Department of City
Planning wants to widen the sidewalks.
Now, I’m not taking a cheap shot at Oakland
or anything, but it is Oakland, not downtown

Manhattan. Even at the busiest time of
pedestrian traﬂic, there is more than an
ample amount of space to walk What good
would wider sidewalks really accomplish?
From what I’ ve seen, it’s not like the subway,

' where people get pushed onto the tracks.

One of the ﬁnal resolutions that the
Department of City Planning is considering
is spending taxpayers’ money on several
attempts to improve the safety of students
and pedestrians directly. These include a
four-way stop light so no traﬂic is moving
when pedestrians cross the street. Am I the
only one who foresees the trafﬁc backup that
this would cause when all traﬂic is stopped
for 30 to 45 seconds?

Another brilliant idea (note sarcasm) is

What does your future hold?

both ways before crossing  

to build bridges over and tunnels under Fifth
Avenue. This may sound like a good idea,
but we don’t really need it Why waste all
this money and the hassle these projects
would cause when there are already truly
safe places to cross the street, such as in ﬁont
of the Book Center near the Towers? It is a
three-lane intersection. This means ‘ that
when the light is red, there is no, I repeat no
traﬂic moving across the walkway. And if
you’re rimning so late that you can’t wait a
minute for the light to turn red, it’s your own
damn fault.

Iarnnot sayingthatthereareno good
ideas out there to improve safety on Fifth
Avenue; we just have to go to old school. I
mean real old school  like kindergarten.
You know, look both ways before you cross
the street. Now, I know some of you
Pennsylvania folks come from one—horse
towns (literally) and that you might have one
stoplight and fewer than a dozen cars in your

village, but you’re in Pittsburgh now. Sure,‘

not a major metropolis, but a city nonethe-
less. _ '

It’s time you learn how to cross the
street And for the love_ of God, you must
ﬁnally realize ﬂiat Fifth Avenue is not a one-
way street. If people just realized that, we

‘ wouldn’t have a problem

If something has to be done, I am in
favor of police “cracking down” on those
dangerous jaywalkers  even though I’ll

probably be one of the ﬁrst ticketed. If tl1at’s ‘

what it takes, though, it’s ﬁne with me. -

' In closing, I will add that if anyone in
the Department of City Planning wants to
make a real safety improvement on a road-
way, how about closing that little bit of road-
way (Bigelow Boulevard) between the
Cathedral of Leaming arid the William Pitt

~ Union? Just because no one’s been hit there

inawhile doesn’tdeemit safe. Ithinkanice
grass ﬁeld would be a nice replacement for
an accident waiting to happen.

Pitt defense must
avoid another dose
of Scarlet fever 8

The Pitt football squad will wel-
come two old friends to campus on
Friday, then try to beat the stuffing out
of them. ‘ ’

Many remember last year’s Pitt-
Rutgers tilt as a coming-out party for
“Pistol” Pete Gonzalez. The current
Steeler threw for a school-record 470
yards and another school record of
seven touchdowns.

But Pitt fans forget that on the
way to their 55-48 loss, Rutgers piled
up 406 yards in the air. Of those, 269
came from Mike McMahon, then a
freshman who went 19 of 38 before a
wicked hit from the Panther defense
forced him out of the game in the
fourth quarter.

Brendan Edmondsfilled in and
brought Rutgers back from a 16-point
deficit to send the game into overtime.

Both quarterbacks decimated a
weak Panther secondary. Both quar-
terbacks took the pressure of a close
Homecoming contest and used it to
their advantage.

Both quarterbacks ' played at

Gonzalez’s level that afternoon.

And both quarterbacks
Pittsburgh this Saturday.

While the Panthers have the
ninth—ranked defense in the nation, the
team’s personnel in the secondary
hasn’t changed much since that long
afternoon in Piscataway last season.
Hank Poteat, who is leading the con-
ference in interceptions this season,
fell prey to a number of Scarlet
Knight post patterns. Secondary
members Chiffon Allen, Tray Crayton
and Chuck Brown fared little better.

Rutgers has yet to explode for 48
points this season, but going into last
year’s tilt with the Panthers, it was
justas unimpressive —- the Knights
had an 0-7 record before the Pitt game
and had scored a grand total of three

visit

points in their two previous contests.

Something just clicked for the
Scarlet squad when faced against the
mad dog defense  sort of like earlier
this season, when Villanova piled up
41 points against the nationally
ranked Pitt defenders.

A A 100-point shootout like last
time remains unlikely, but McMahon
and Edmonds could still victimize the
same squad that allowed 542 yards to
the Knights in 1997.

And Gonzalez can’t answer for
the Panthers. Sure, he attended prac-

~It’s ﬁnally Homecoming weekend,
and this year’s game is going to be a big
one. The Panthers will be looking to
bounce back after a tough loss last week-
end to the Tar Heels. Rutgers will be
looking for some respect in the Big East.
The Panthers have dominated
Rutgers in the past. They have won ﬁve
of the seven Big East meetings and are
9-0 4 against Rutgers at home. The

Panthers have also had plenty of .

Homecoming success. Since 1970, the
Panthers have posted a 19-8-1
Homecoming record. V

When these two teams faced off last
year, Pitt was supposed to obliterate the
Scarlet Knights. Instead, the Panthers
were surprised. Rutgers came close to

When Pitt plays its ﬁrst of six consec-
utive Big East Conference matchups this
weekend against Rutgers, it will be facing
one of the two teams to play in the
ﬁrst collegiatefootball game back in
1869.

Rutgers University has the nick-
name Scarlet Knights, which has its
origin in the mid-1950s, when the
New Jersey college changed its name
from the Chanticleers. The
Chanticleer was a character in
Geoffrey Chaucer’s ‘Canterbury
Tales.” * _

The school was known as
Queen’s College whenlit was char-
tered in 1766, and the athletic teams»
were referred to as the “Queensmen.”

That didn’t sit well with the stu-
dent body, so they adopted a giant
felt-covered ﬁghting bird for their
mascot in 1925. But the mascot
looked like a chicken. So in 1955, the uni-
versity created the Scarlet Knight.

Rutgers was hoping to spur the all-
around good athletic promise and ﬁghting
spirit, so it once again let the students

spirited white charger horse. This change
came to represent a new era at Rutgers, one
that was supposed to rejuvenate ﬁrst-class
football in\New J ersey..

Scarlet had already been the universi-
ty’s oﬂicial color since 1869, when it was
proposed in the campus newspaper. That
year, Rutgers squared off against Princeton
in the first football game. Princeton

 

watched as the Rutgers team members
donned scarlet turbans and kerchiefs for
identiﬁcation purposes. This was also a ﬁrst
for collegiate athletics. According to the
university, “'I‘l1e color scarlet has become

embodied in the literature and songs of ‘ .

Rutgers University.” q
Scarlet was actually Rutgers’ sec-
ond choice. It wanted orange for its

New Brunswick, New Jersey, but
the university could not ﬁnd an
orange ﬂag in the vicinity. So it
decided on scarlet, which hap-
pened to be the color in the coat of
arms associated with the heritage."
The scarlet ribbon was easily
obtained, and it has stuck with the
2 university ever since.

talizing spirit aching to come out. If
there’s a stiaddler here and there at
the game on Saturday screaming,

Tuunsonv, 15 OCTOBER 1998

ll/lcDonough makes

This is a big week in college foot-
ball. The Panthers have their
Homecoming game, and many of the
nation’s top teams are in action. The
Pitt News ran into CBS sportscaster
Sean McDonough in the hall, and he
made our first guest pick of the year. If
all goes according to plan, this will
become a weekly feature. So without
further adieu, this week’s picks led by
Mr. McDonough:

Guest pick of the week by Sean
McDonough:
Oregon (+10 1/2) at UCLA

UCLA has a strong team this year,
but the Ducks will give the Bruins a
run for their money. Look for a close
game that will be decided late.
Bruins 31, Ducks 28 P

Rutgers (+21 1/2) at Pitt
OK, the Panthers have had a rocky
beginning, but their defense is ranked

ninth in the nation. The Scarlet.

Knights have none + count them:
zero —— Big East wins. The =~Panther
offense has been anything but stellar,
but this game may be just what it
needs .to gain some confidence in
itself. Matt Lytle will try out the
option on the weak Rutgers defense,
and the Panthers should try to get their
offense healthy. Hank Poteat will look
to add to his Big East—leading four
interceptions against Rutgers’ passing
game, which is its bread and butter,

ring the ball for them,

along with the option. Look for Pitt to
come out fired up for Homecoming
and to treat the fans well. Pitt will
cover the spread and then some.
Panthers 56, Scarlet Knights 14

Syracuse (-13) at Boston College

The Orangemen are just too good.
They have a few key players injured,
including receiver Quinton Spotwood,
who is out for the season, but Donovan
McNabb is till throw-

and there are very few
teams, if any, who can
even stop him in their
wildest dreams.
Syracuse A should be
able to pass all over
this team —‘ that is, if
McNabb decides not to run for over

— 100 yards. Look for the Eagles’ fans to

be very disappointed this weekend.
Orangemen 45, Eagles 21

Minnesota (+37 1/2) at Ohio State
Wow! The Gophers are bad, and
the Buckeyes are good, but 37 1/2 is
ridiculous. It is almost impossible to
cover a spread this big. Andy
Katzenmoyer ‘and the OSU defense

should be able to hold the Golden

Gophers belo_w 30, but it will be tough
for the Buckeye offense to outscore
Minnesota by 38 points. In any case,
the Buckeyes aren’t No. l for nothing,
and the pollsters are right: OSU will

this year

 

cover the spread and then some.
Buckeyes 63, Golden Gophers 14

Temple (+34) at Virginia Tech
The Owls are very bad. They are"

competing with Rutgers for the title of ’

worst team in the Big East. The Hokies.
are still looking for the Big East title
and will not let the Owls stand in their
way. Virginia Tech’s quarterback tan-
dem of Al Clark and Dave Meyer will
' pound the weak Owl
defense, and the
Temple offense will
run the option all
afternoon whether it
works or not. The
Hokies will win but
will not be able to
cover.

Hokies 45, Owls 21

Clemson (+29) at Florida State
Chris Weinke is filling in for Dan
Kendra admirably  well, sort of.
Weinke started out the year very
rough. As a matter of fact, he was one
of the worst quarterbacks in Division
1. He has since improved a great deal,
and Florida State, always a national
powerhouse, once again is in the top
25. The Seminoles will be ready to
play at home. The Tigers really have
no chance in this game. Clemson is a
good team, but it is almost always out-
matched in the Atlantic S Coast
Conference. The Tigers will put up a

’s firslguesl pick

good fight and cover the enormous

spread, but they’ll lose.
Seminoles 34, Tigers 16

Kansas (+34 1/2) at Nebraska

The Comhuskers are pissed. A
defeat to Texas A&M last week cost
them their No. 1 ranking. The Aggies
upset Nebraska, and with Tom
Osborne’s departure last year, this
team has a lot to prove. It took a big
step backward last week and will look
to make that up this week. The com-
fed linemen at Nebraska will blow the
Aggie front into the state of Iowa.
Look for the Huskers to run, run and
then run some more before’ they run
into the end zone for a big win. The

Huskers will cover the spread with no *1

problem, and their big win will give
then hope for another national champi-
onship. '
Huskers 52, Jayhawks 12

This week’s best bet:

Oklahoma State (+20) at Kansas,

State .

The new version of the Purple
People Eaters resides in Manhattan,
Kan. The Wildcats are ranked No. 1 in
the country in defense, and that
defense will shut down the Cowboys’
offense. Look for a low—scoring game
for Oklahoma State and a big win for
the purple and silver attack of Kansas
State.

Wildcats 35, Cowboys 7

Long, grueling hours in the
trenches.» Waking up at 6:30 a.m.
only to hear the strategic planning
and raving of a person you have to
treat with the utmost respect.

Sound similar to the military?

Wrong!

It’s preseason football camp
with Pitt strength and conditioning
coach Buddy Morris, not basic train-
ing. Panther wideout Kenney
Ketchen is familiar with both.

During his stint in the military,
Ketchen served in the Persian Gulf
War, and he has seen the inner work-

‘ ings of the military. But he also has

seen the inner workings of Morris’
camp. 2
“Buddy’s program is much more
intense,” Ketchen said. 1 .
Ketchen spent time in the Navy
as an operations specialist on the
U.S.S. Independence and Kitty
Hawk aircraft carriers.
He has experienced difficult

competition before; however, he did‘

not experience organized football
competition until two years ago.

Ketchen’s story is far from that
of the stereotypical college football
player recruited out of high school.
In fact, he did not play organized
football until enrolling in Chaffey
College in 1996, _but that has not
stopped him from‘ picking up the
game quickly .— and, as a wide
receiver, he needs to be fast.

For Chaffey last season,
Ketchen caught 27 passes for 613
yards and made seven touchdowns.

Ketchen moves from carriers to catches

Of those 613 yards, 202 of them
.came in one game, setting a Chaffey
single-game receiving yardage
record.

Ketchen is 26 years old and
is considered a junior at Pitt. So
what is a 26-year-old Persian Gulf
War veteran from New York doing at
Pitt? The answer to that question is
probably the simplest and least con-
fusing part of his past few years.

“I found out about Pitt by doing
research, and they had so much past
prestige,” said Ketchen.

Because of his age, Ketchen has
some added life experiences behind
him, but when it comes to football,
that's not even an issue.

“I don’t even think they [his
teammates] know that I’m older. I’m
just a junior and new to the game,
and I’m learning new stuff all of the
time,” said Ketchen.

' Eleven other players are "also"
junior—co1lege transfers. There are

two other transfers, 12 redshirt

freshman and 18 true freshmen on
this year’s roster, making the
Panthers a young and inexperienced
team. This year, 14 Panthers, includ-
ing Ketchen, have seen their first
NCAA Division I action.

Ketchen has started in three of.

Pitt’s five games this seasoniand has
caught six passes" for a total of 39
yards. 1

He is currently majoring in soci-
ology, in which he hopes to posi-
tively guide children and possibly
pursue a career in teaching. One
thing is for sure: Kenney Ketchen
will have a lot to teach and talk
about. ’

tice on Tuesday and tossed the ball
around a bit, but all the Steeler can do
Saturday is watch the "Homecoming
game while he prepares for the
Baltimore Ravens.

Matt Lytle’s adventures in his own
end zone last week have cast a few
doubts on his ability to carry Pistol
Pete’s mantle. Even head coach Walt
Harris knows better than to try and
turn the big southpaw into a Gonzo-
esque gunslinger. The option has
become a staple-in the offense, and
Lytle would not throw 42 passes in a
game (like Gonzalez did against
Rutgers) unless Pitt’s running backs
got caught in traffic and missed the
first three quarters. ’

McMahon, however, could throw

FROM PAGE 11

142 times. He was on pace to do it last

year before his injury, and with the
Pitt secondary still somewhat suspect
(picture _all the dropped passes in the
Penn State game suddenly being
thrown to receivers who can catch), he
could find his stride very‘ quickly. .

If he doesn’t, Rutgers head coach

Terry Shea can replace him with
Edmonds, who threw for three touch-
downs against Pitt last season in 5:05
worth of playing time, give or take an
overtime or two.

Whoever the Knights have leading
their offense, ‘Pitt will answer with a
ﬁerce blitz, led by linebacker Phil
Clarke .and defensive end Julian
Graham. However, the blitz could be
without Pete Simonian and Bryan
Jacobs, both on the shelf with neck
injuries. .

McMahon and Edmonds had time
to dissect the Panther defense once
before. The results nearly killed Pitt’s
bowl hopes.

This year, they come to Pitt’s
Homecoming instead of hosting the
Panthers for their own. . _

The fans will make a difference,
but only barely: Pitt 41, Rutgers 30.

Even nationally ranked defenses
have off days.

Kevin Lilley is the senior football
writer for The Pitt News and watched
last year’s Pitt-Rutgers game from the
comfort of the Scarlet Knight press
box.

uct Mike McMahon, who will be
Rutgers’ starting quarterback. Last year,
he set a Rutgers single—season record
with 1,259 passing yards. He ended up
being ranked seventh nationally among
freshmen signal—callers.

That. defense has wreaked havoc on
its opposition. Pitt’s opponents are aver-
aging only 270.6 total yards per game.

Pitt’s pass defense, ranked 10th in the '

country, should cause enough problems
for McMahon. This portion of Pitt’s
defense is led by Hank Poteat, who has
four interceptions in five games. The
Panthers’ pass defense also ranks second
in the Big East with 16 sacks.

The Panther offense would like to
get back.on track after last week’s per-
formance. It has a good chance of doing
so against a defense that was giving up
45.1 points per game last time the teams
met and is giving big points once again
this season.

The Panthers have added the option-

to their repertoire this year, and that
could cause some confusion for oppos-
ing defenses.

The Pitt defense will have to watch
out for an offense that produced an aver-
age of 25.4 points per game in the last
ﬁve games of the season last year. That
included a 48-point performance against
Pitt. »

If Pitt plays the way it usually does
at home, it will probably come out with
a win. If it doesn’t, Rutgers could escape
with a big upset. ' I‘ -

This game is going to be very
important in the Big East standings and
in Pitt’s bid for a bowl game. A win
would make the Panthers 3-3, and they
would still have a good chance of going
to a bowl game as well as staying in con-
tention for the Big East title. A loss
would put a lot of pressure on the
Panthers.
