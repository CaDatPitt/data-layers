UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

PACS Assembles Saturday

To Discuss Timely Issues

College students throughout
Pennsylvania have joined to-
gether to voice their opinion in

\,the legislature through the Penn-

1

sylvania Association of College
Students (PACS) which will meet
Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30
p.m. in the Student Union Ball-
room and Supper Room.
' The theme of the second PACS
meeting will be “The Second Step
.” John Tabor, secretary of
commerce in Pennsylvania, will
give the keynote address at 10:30
a.m. James Gallagher, chairman
of the House Higher Education
Committee, will deliver the din-
ner speech at 5:30 ‘p.m.

The executive committee of
PACS plans to introduce four
resolutions for discussion. The
ﬁrst deals with drugs on college
campuses. It states that “con-
trary to the current emphasis of
the State Legislature, the viola-
tion of narcotic laws does not
solely or even primarily occur
upon college campuses.” PACS
believes the users are only a
small percentage of the state’s

gtlstudent body but by no means

F,"-

Irv

inconsequential.

University state-relatedness is
the subject‘ of the second resolu-

tion on the agenda. PACS urges

state-relatedness since there is a
deﬁnite need for a Western Penn-
sylvania university and the Uni-
versity “will be beneﬁcial to
higher education in this state.”

-A student minimum wage of
$1.25 is recommended if it does
not already exist, as noted in
House Bill 1639.

‘The fourth resolution
mends the Pennsylvania legisla-
ture for the creation of the schol-
arship fund and urges that a base
amount of $3.5 million to be offer-
ed to freshmen be increased in

. future years.

COIX1- .

PACS began February 26, 1966,
when a group of Pennsylvania
student leaders met to discuss in-
terviews with. legislators, state
administrators, c o 11 e g e officials
and lobbyists.

The constitution written by
PACS members includes promot-
ing inter-school contact both, on
the leadership level and individ-
ual level; initiating action on mat-
ters of concern to the member-

ship of the organization; serving
as a central source of inforrna-
tion concerning Pennsylvania ‘for
member schools and individuals;
acting as a lobby to encourage
legislative action favorable to the
college and university students

of Pennsylvania; and taking posi- ‘

tions and initiating action only
on issues that directly affect the
college and university students of
Pennsylvania.

Voters March in DC.
Try to End Viet War

Among a large delegation from
Pennsylvania in the recent voters’
march to end the war in Vietnam
were ten University students.
These students, all members of the
Society for Democratic Studies,
participated in what a- spokes-
man for the group said was a
“very sedate and extremely or-
derly” march. They also heard»
speeches from Dr. Benjamin
Spock, world-famed child psycho-
logist; Norman Thomas; and sev-
eral other speakers.

The ma-rch, which attracted,be-
tween 12,000 and 15,000 march-
ers to Washington, D. C., was a
part of a nationwide effort to get
voters to pledge their votes for
candidates who run on a peace
platform. The SDS spokesman
stated that approximately 73,000-
pledges had been received at the
time of the march and that the ﬁg-
ure was expected todouble.

Dr. Spock, the main speaker at
the march rally, was a professor
of child development at the Uni-
versity’s School of Medicine and
the director of child development
at Western Pennsylvania Psychi-
atric Institute from 19-51 to 1955.

4 Mortar Board To Meet

   
   

By BERNI McLEOD
The weekend of September 30,
Mortar Board members from sev-
en Pennsylvania and West Vir-
ginia colleges will visit the Uni-
-versity_ for an annual regional

 
    
   
 
   
     
  

convention.

Mortar Board is a national hon-
orary for senior women which
chooses its members on the basis
of scholarship, leadership and
school service. Each year chap-
ter representatives meet at a dif-
ferent host college to discuss im-
portant group programs, prob-
lems and activities.

This Fall, "the Mortar Board
members will try to ﬁnd new sol-
utions to old problems: What is
the best way» to select new mem-

bers? How can a chapter stretch‘

its funds. What are some good
service projects? '

The tentative program includes
Va1‘i01lS group ‘discussion’ groups-,
and a. talk by Mrs. Erma Meyer.
son,‘ professor of social group
work, Graduate School. of Social
Work, on “The Responsibilities of
an Honorary on Campus,”

The visiting Mortar Boardmem-
bets

   

     

will ‘also - receive . a ./ tour ’ pf . .

Spock attacked the war in Viet-
nam as morally, legally, and
strategically wrong.

Other speakers at the demon-

stration included Norman Thom- '

as, four-time -Communist candi-
date for presidency; I. F. Stone,
publisher of a prominent liberal
newsletter; and Irving Howell, a
professor of English at Hunter
College in New York city?‘
Howell’s speach was an answer
to President Lyndon Baines John-
son’s speech a day earlier at
Princeton University in which. he
called for the nation’s intellec-
tuals to join in supporting the
"Vietnam war. Howell contended
that ,the intellectuals could never
follow the President’s request, be-
cause they saw the inconsisten-
cies and faults in the administra-
tion’s policies. “

To Consult and Advise

Administration On

Non-Curricular Affairs   

(See Edz'torial—Page Four)

. The University Senate has
formed 2. ‘Student Affairs
Committee to consult with
and advise the administra-
tion on student problems, ac-
cording to Dr. Albert Mar-
tin, professor of political science
and a member of the new fac-
ulty committee.

Dr. Martin said that the Sen-
ate feels that “student affairs is
an important part of the Univer-
sity’s operations which requires
faculty, as well as administrative,
interest.” Another member of the
new committee, Dr. Paul McLain,
remarked that the Senate felt a
need for a committee with some
responsibility in the area o-f non-
curricular student affairs.

‘The Student Affairs Committee
will be working mainly with the
office of Helen Pool Rush, dean
in charge of student a1fairs.Miss
Bush said that she had‘ sent a
note to Dr. George Fahey, secre-

tary of the Senate, in which she-

sincerely welcomed the organiza-
tion of the committee. “We val-
ue the opportunity to talk With
the faculty and need to keep to-
gether in student affairs prob-
lems,” continued Miss Rush.

No charter has been drafted
yet which clearly deﬁnes the pur-
pose and scope of the new com-
mittee. Dr. Martin plans to call
a meeting ofthe committee late
this week to set up a charter and
to elect a chairman.

The committee members were

elected Friday by the University ,

Degree — M.Ph
j7'Yale University established a
new degree, the Master of Philo-
sophy, last week. The degree rep-
resents the same academic accom-
plishments as a Ph.D., except for
the completion of a dissertation.

John Perry Miller, dean of the
Graduate School, explained that
the new degree is designed to
help put an end to the shortage
‘of ﬁrst rate college teachers, es-
peciallyfor freshmen and sopho-
more level courses.
* The University of California
at Berkeley, as part of its recent
ireform proposals, called for a
 Doctor of Arts degree that would
 be much like the Yale M. Ph. But
1; some object to the new degree
[ on the basis that it would de-
[base the Ph.D.
However, the Yale proposal
 simply upgrades the master’s de-
 gree and eliminates the Masters
4 of Arts and the Master of Science
‘ degrees. '

  

      
     
   
 
 
   
  
   

Yale hopes that the change will
’ eliminate dilletantes who stay on
V for a year more without serious
[' .b intention to complete graduate
. work. “It will eliminate the draft
L dodgers and the women on the
prowl for husbands,” said one
Yale spokesman.

& Yale awarded the ﬁrst Ph.D.
fldegrees more than 100 years ago.
,,_.Before then American students
, had to study in Europe in order

Service Postdoctoral Research
Fellow before going to Tufts Uni-
Versity in 1954. '

Dean of the School of Medi-
cine Francis Cheever stated, “Dr.
Moldave’s contributions to medi-
cine's knowledge of protein chem-
istry have been hailed by his
fellow research workers; in addi-
tion, he brings with him the rep-
utation of being an effective and
dedicated teacher. We look for-
ward with keen anticipation to

the development of an outstand- '

ing program in biochemistry un-
der his leadership.”

The appointment of Dr. Mol-
dave ﬁlls a vacancy created in
1964 when his predecessor, Dr.
Klaus Hofmann, was named to the
Jonas E. Salk Commonwealth
Professorship of Experimental
Medicine.

 

Dr. Egbert de Vries has been
named professor of International
Development in the University's
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs (GSPIA).

Dr. de Vries is a former rector

Aptheker First A

TowardABetter Union

By Bill Cabin

“Which one is he?”

“I don’t know.” I

“The young guy on the right looks pretty dangerous.”

These were the remarks of two students prior to the
May 4 appearance of Dr. Herbert Aptheker. Such com-
ments typify a serious lack of political awareness and an
essentially prejudiced, anti-intellectual demeanor present in
[the student body.

SPEAKERS OF APTHEKER’S CALIBRE challenge
students to think about their ideological convictions. The
lack of such a continual challenge here makes it essential to
-- establish a University-sanctioned means for bringing more
. outspoken speakers to the University. One solution to this.
vacuum would be a Political Union.
A The Union would function as a non-partisan committee
 ‘ "=;;%;¥§ for selecting a series of social critics to
; speak here annually. Speakers would be
chosen on their ability to present—a point of
view on a social issue, not necessarily the
rightness of the viewpoint. Prominent edi-
tors and reporters, scholars, political fig-
ures, and representatives of speciﬁc inter-
. est groups would be included in the series.
One representative from each politically-
oriented group on campus would constitute
~ the Union committee. For instance, Stu-
jl CABIN dents For Peace, Liberal Forum, Society
Conservative Studies, Young Democrats, and Young Re-
. publicans would each have a representative. The commit-
- tee would also have an advisory board of professors and
circulate suggestion sheets throughout the student body. ,

_ FUNDS WOULD BE DERIVED primarily from the
Student Activities Fee with a fixed yearly allocation. Each
represented group would also contribute a nominal amount
to the committee’s treasury. _

Now, except on rare occasions, students get little op-
portunity to hear controversial social critics at this Uni-
versity. Programming of the Student Union Board (SUB)
is not designed to encourage a fervent exchange of ideas on
political and social issues. Unfortunately, the Board is the
only student organization sufficiently funded to contract
speakers.

The ideas in this column are only guidelines for a P0-
-litical Union and more formal Work is needed before such a
committee can submit for recognition by the University.
Despite the lack of formal plans at this stage, the need is
pervasive. Such a committee is justified because it will
help"‘develop more intelligent student opinion and prepare
students better for their roles as responsible, informed citi-
zens.

, The Union would be supported by student money, pro-
grjéammed by student members, and designed to benefit the
., student body. Such a committee has been non-existent too
"long, and only the initiative of active student groups can
make it exist.

miss the opportunity of studying under this man and the professor misses
contact with divergent student types.

Some professors have chosen to avoid student controversies, and at
the same time have proven to be" effective advisors to student groups.
Faculty members often know administrative ropes and can prevent groups
from breaking University regulations.

Having collegiate activity experience behind them, they can give
effective ideas for strengthening membership and developing purposeful
group programs. Because the advisor will often have contacts in the com-
munity and academic world he can aid in bringing noteworthy speakers
to campus and setting up panel discussions.

Since our return to campus,
The Pitt News has hit an all ‘time
low for both news coverage and
editorials. The format of its head-
lines resembles the “yellow
press” of Hearst fame in its at-
tempt to produce sensation with-
out fact to back it up.

IIIIIIIIIFIIIIIIIIIV
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIF.

For example, in the Wednes-
day, 11, issue, the headline
reads ~,“Campus Usage of LSD
Illegal,” with no further com-
ment. on this illegality within

the article. (However, it is men- -

tioned that the New York State
Legislature has action of this
sort pending. This, of course,
means it is illegal at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.)

In another stupendous article,
again on the front page, there
is a subheadline that the Rus-
kin Building is “To Be Used
for medical students, whether
ever, within the column its says
the apartments are to be used
for medicals students, whether
married or single.

The editorial, written by our
new editor, Frederick N. Frank,
is so poorly written that I could
ﬁll his entire 12-page gossip pa-
per with commentary. Without
regard to the content, any stu-
dent who has completed fresh-
man composition will easily no-
tice the poor sentence construc-
tion (almost childish) and the

senseless repition. The title of »

this “literary masterpice” is “Drug
Policy Needed,” but by whom?
According to Frank, “The Uni-
versity is not equipped to han-
dle such matters. This is clearly
a case for local and federal nar-
cotic authorities.”

I have held my tongue for the
past few issues, hoping this pa-
per would improve. (I had er-
roneously thought it could get
no worse.) But‘ now I ﬁnd it
an insult to my intelligence
I would suggest that we either
get a new staff or a new style
of writing‘ and fact ﬁnding.

Dictionary, Anyone?
Associated Collegiate Press

Among the many fascinating pieces of mail delivered to the
University o-f Richmond Collegian office within the past few weeks,
including Hugh Hefner’s “Playboy Philosophy” and “Fair Play for

Rhodesia” literature, the prize winner must stand as “Barron’s How"

to Prepare for the Student Draft Deferment Test,” by Samuel 'C.

Brownstein and Mitchell Weiner. -

Commenting on the book in an editorial, the Collegian said:

Not stopping to wonder why we were so honored as to receive
a free copy, we cannot but sympathize with those who are faced
with the necessity of either passing, the test or losing their student
draft deferment status. The vocabulary -section alone would cause
consternationto a Ph.D. in English. _

For example, the. following section is made up of a. few words
from th-e “s” section: “The sanguine and scurrilous man, While
studying sidereal bodies uttered the shibboleth to the saturnine scul-
lion who lived in a. salubrious area and had not a scintilla/_ of sen-
tentious, yet sardonic and sapient, remarks.” In another section the
stud-ent is asked to give antonyms for a number of words including
clandestine, obfuscate, amorphous, apothegm, chary and abstemioug_

Not to be outdone, the word relation section, where one is re-
quired to discover the relation between the ﬁrst two words and then
ﬁnd another pair which exhibits the same type of relationship, asks
the student to. ﬁnd the relationship between such words as chauvin-
ist: country; caclaverous: robust; antimacassar: sofa; purloin: bor-
row; and peaceful: halcyon.

Any person who ﬁnds himself inithe position bf havingto take
this test is welcome to look at our copy of Barron”s book. Moreover,
anyone who knows every word in the book, or even 80 per cent of
them, ought to be awarded the third edition of the Webster’s in.
tellect medal. ’

All is not lost. For those who must take the test and don’t have
time to memorize the dictionary, just remember that: “The proclivity
to a pristine proboscis in the progenitors of the Viet Cong does not
debilitate nor defalcate. the contumacious, yet condign- and conti-
guous, appurtenances.”

Letters’ to the Editor must
carry the complete name, school»
or address of the writer and
they should be typewritten and .
triple-spaced. Pen names will
be permitted or names will be
withheld at the discretion of

the Editor. Statements lacking
in good taste or fair play will
be rejected, and all letters wre

Would you believe two years-in the South Seas
working in education, health or public works?
There are problems in paradise, and the Peace
Corps has been asked to help solve them.

This is a brand new program.

On May 1, 1966, the Peace Corps was invited into
the Pacific Trust Territory which the U.S. manages
for the United Nations. Needed immediately are
liberal arts and science students who aren't afraid
to work —— hard.

It's one enchanted opportunity.

it Baseball Team -Faces
  St. Vincent Nine Today

At Leech Farm’s Field

By GEORGE LIES

Barring rain and traffic jams, the Panther baseball
team goes out on the road for two home games this week.
Today they meet St. Vincent, and Friday, they face Alle-
gheny. Both games begin at 3:30 p.m.

Leech Farm Veterans’ Field, a sort of a home away
from home, is the mitters’ playing field. However, it 1s a

good 20 minute drive from the
team’s practice ﬁeld. And for a
team which hardly ever receives
home crowd enthusiasm (one
home game since April 8), both
games are more away than home
affairs.

Don Stock, who has not pitched
in two weeks, starts for coach
Bobby Lewis against the Saints.
Pitcher Paul Helsel, who has been
injured for the past month, may
also see action.

If Lewis does replace Stock
with Helsel, Stock will shift to
the other end of the battery.
“Don has been a big help,” said
Lewis. “As a two-way player, he
has done a ﬁne job d-espite. start-
ing practice late because of a
broken ankle.” When Stock‘is on
the mound, Guy Bucci catches.

Dave Welty, another player
who holds the team together,
pitches Friday against the Indi-
ans. Besides leading the team in

A pitching with an earned run aver-

age of 0.77, he is also the leading
hitter at .385.

In today’s game, Lewis plans
to platoon Welty in the outﬁeld
with either Phil Nasrallah (.350)
or left-hand hitting Torn Stickel
(.231) depending on the pitcher.

Last season, the Saints drop-

who pitched a perfect no-hit, no-
run game against Washington
and iefferson last week. He struck
out 13 batters for his third shut-
out of the season.

Runs Against
Notre Dame

The track team travels to Notre
Dame this Saturday for their last
dual meet of the season. All that’s
left after that is the IC4A’s, the
last weekend of May.

Last weekend Penn State de-
feated the trackmen, 124-26. Ex-
cept for Dick Crout’s victory in
the 440—yard dash, Carl Rees’
team was shut out of ﬁrst place.
Of the 18 events, the tracksters
were only able to place second
three times—Crout in the 220;
Luddy Hayden, broad jump and
Tom Christie, the 440 intermedi-
ate hurdles.

By JOSEPH A. DIVACK
On May 9 the Center for Phil-
osophy of Science presented its
last speaker for this academic
year. Dr. Morton Beckner, asso-
‘ciate professor of philosophy at
Pomona College, spoke on “Non-
deductive Logic.” He supported
John Stuart Mill’s program of the
reduction of inductive to deduc-
tive logic, something which is
easily dismissed these days as “a
dead letter of philosophy.”
Inductive logic is the mode of
_inference used when we assert
that “the sun will rise tomor-
row.” Our grounds are generally
' a number of past cases. Deduc-
tive logic, on the other hand, is
’ well illustrated by the truths of
mathematics. These are true “in
all possible worlds.” One essen-
tial difference between induction
and deduction is that empirical
< evidence can falsify a correctly
made induction, but not a deduc-
7 tion.

 
  
 
 
   
   
 

Mill’s program states that every
induction is a species of syl1ogis-
tic argument with a suppressed
(unstated) universal’ premise or
ground. The unstated premise
makes reference to the uniform-
ity of the couse of nature.

Dr. Beckner believes that this
view has high initial plausibility.
He proceeded to describe Why it
has been criticized, what sort of
formal foundation is needed for
the program, and what of philo-
sophical interest could be built
on this foundation-.

Professor Beckner, while ad-
mitting that the Millian program
has never_ been made speciﬁc, de-
fended it against three main ac-
fended it against three main crit-
icisms. Some claim that the pro-
gram could not be carried out for
logical reasons. Others say that
nothing interesting results from
it since it explains nothing. A
third faction, headed by G. H.
Von Wright believes the program

is founded on the misconception
that the only valid inferences
are deductive.

The speaker cautioned against
a confusion of two questions in
Mill’s writing. The philosophical
dilemma of the justification of in-
duction is confused with a speci-
fication of the conditions for the
validity of inductive inference.
Dr. Beckner argued for the use-
fulness and meaningfulness of
the concept of non-deductive val-
idity.

This,m0ve is controversial since
the notion of validity has usually
been reserved for deductive argu-
ment, while inductions have tra-
ditionally been characterized
merely as more or less warrant-
ed, or strong.

Dr. Beckner argued that an es-
sential feature of rule-guided rea-
soning is its formal character. In-
ference warrants a transfer of
conﬁdence from premises to con-
clusion, and in this there is no

essential difference between in-
duction and deduction.

“The subject matter of induc-
tive logic is the relation of im-
plication between premises and
conclusion,” states Dr. Beckner.
He urged logicians to attempt the
construction of some formal sys-
tem to rigorize our intuitive no-
tion of inductive validity.

Philosophers are bound to dis-
agree over the validity of vari-
ous inductive arguments, but the
general goal should be the de-
temination of a class of v-alid in-
ductions while avoiding the para-
doxes of implication.
~ In the ﬁnal section of his lec-
ture, Dr. Beckner described 'the
applications of his Millian posi-
tion to probability arguments.He
ﬁnds nothing wrong with the re-
duction of the validity problem
to one of fair sampling. Using
population-sample and popula-
tion-case illustrations from his

biological background ,he showed
