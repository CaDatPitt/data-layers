Bond Drive
Nears Goal
Set Here

Sales of bonds and stamps in
the University war -bond drivc
reached a total of $6,833.25 here
Monday, November 27. The
amount, more than two-thirds of
the oﬂicial goal which is $8,275,
was collected by the War Finance
committee from individual stu-
dents and organizations during the
ﬁrst week of the campaign.

Fraternities leading in the pur-
chase of bonds and stamps are:
Phi Sigma Sigma, Alpha Epsilon
Phi, and Phi Mu. The total Dur-
chases of individual groups will
be posted regularly on a chart
located near the new bond booth

on the ground ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral.

Jackie Goodman, C, chairman

of the drive, said, “The committee
has certainly received the coop-
eration and good will of all the
students. However, the drive will
not end until December 16, and
the continued support and enthu-
siasm of Pitt men and women
cannot be emphasized too strongly.
The theme of the project, ‘Stop
rolling in clover; the war isn’t
over’, is one I hope will be kept
in mind. It’s true that our goal
has almost been attained, but the
more additional bonds and stamps
bought, the better. All campus
organizations are invited to par-
ticipate in the competition. The
booth on the ground floor is open
from 11:30 to 3:30 every day, so
'there’s always the opportunity to
buy bonds.

According to Louise Johnston,
assistant chairman, the healthy
competition among the fraternities
is a decided factor in the bond
sales. “Some fraternities have
invested thousands of dollars in
bonds and stamps. We hope many
other groups will follow their
example."

The purpose of the drive is to
purchase a “duck,” a two and a
half ton amphibian truck. Newest
saying around the campus is,
“Wanna buy a duck?”

Pitt’s ﬁrst all formal dance,
since the war began, the annual
Interfraternity ball, head.ed by
John Gallager, BA, will be pre-
sented Friday evening, December
8, in the Urban room of Hotel
William Penn. Bob Strong’s or-
chestra, playing at the closed af-
fair, will begin at 9 and end at 1
o’clock.

An innovation at this year’s
IF dance will be individual fra-

.ternity booths where fraternity

brothers and their dates can
gather, announce-d Nate Prashkor,

ence you will find it in the Pitt Players production, Tonight at Eight,
to be given at 8 o'clock in Stephen Foster memorial tomorrow and

Saturday.

Owl Pix Deadline
Set by Hurrell

Deadline for individual pictures
for the 1945 Owl has been
extended to Saturday, December
2, but, according to Circulation
Manager Dodie Hurrell, C, “This
deadline must be met in order

that the Owl may be released on
May 4 publication date.

Picture procedure for Owl buy-
ers, as outlined by Manager Hur-
rell, is to show the receipt
obtained from the salesman to the
person at the desk in the Owl
oﬂice. “The card that the buyer
receives here should be taken with
him to the fourth ﬂoor of the
Gimbel Bros. department store,
where the photograph will be
taken.”

booths will be decorated with each
fraternity’s colors.

George Smith, C, IF sing chair-
man, is attempting to arrange a
broadcast of the competition over
station WWSW. Arrangements,
however, are not yet deﬁnite. Each
men’s fraternity will enter ‘a
team consisting from four to eight
men. Each team will be allotted
ﬁve minutes in which to sing two
songs one of which must be a
fraternity song. Judges will be
Mr. Theodore M. Finney, director
of men’s musical activities, and
music cri-tics from the Pittsburgh
Press and Pittsburgh Post Gazette.

¢ﬁrst play considers the ever pres-

ent problem of world improve-
ment and ﬁnds an original solu-
tion in a World Without Men. A
Sunny Morning has a delightful
Spanish -background that creates
mood and atmosphere for the
tender love story of two sweet-
hearts. The third play, Wafr
Brides, is a story of peasant life
in a small war-torn country of
Europe during the early months
of World War I. In addition to
the three one-act plays, the pro-
gram will include a ten-minute
blackout sketch entitled Democ-
racy, which was presented by the
Pitt Players early in October.

Tonight at Eight will be an
entirely Pitt production with Miss
Ruth Haun directing and Pitt stu-
dents coaching, acting, building
the scenery, and working on prop-
erties. The staff includes: Mar-
cella Strutzel, Ed, general stage
manager; Bob Goldsmith, C, tech-

Chancellor’s Reception Friday

\

Parents Attend
Annual Affair

Parents of approximately 800
September freshmen have been
formally invitedito attend the
‘.wenty—fourth annual Chan°.el‘=cr’s
reception this Friday evening in
the Commons room. It/it‘. Theodore
W. Biddle, dean of men and
reception chairman, added, prior
to listing the general outline of
the program, “Replies received
Monday and before show that a
high percentage of those invited
will attend.”

Chancellor John G. Bowman
will highlight the reception pro-

gram with an irformal talk
directed to the parents of the
freshmen.

Preceding Dr. Bowman’s ad-

dress, Mr. Frederick Lotz, Univer-
sity organist, will play several
organ selections. A combined
Women’s and Men’s Glee club will
immediately follow Mr. Lotz on
the program, marking the first
appearance of a student organiza-
tion in the Reception festivities.
Mr. Biddle will then introduce the
Chancellor.

The idea of a freshmen-parent
reception was introduced at Pitt
by Dr. Bowman in 1921, his first
year as Chancellor. The signiﬁ-
cance of the affair, as written by
Dr. Bowman in the preface of
the program addressing the par-
ents, is:

“If you have a boy or girl who
is a student at the University, we
want you to ‘think of yourself as
a teacher and a ‘member of our
faculty. We want you to try with
us to be a great teacher.”

Under the direction of Mr.
Robert Arthur,’assistant to the
dean of men, and Miss Harriet
Glasser, assistant to the dean of
women, almost 200 men and
women students of the Univer-
sity will act as aides in presenting
parents to Chancellor Bowman
and the deans, serving refresh-
ments, and acting as guides.

In time, it has been said, human beings can become hard-
ened to anything through constant repetition. There is a deﬁ-
nite danger, today, that a hardening of our arteries of under-
standing and sacriﬁce may be taking place. The Sixth War
Loan drive is on. Signboards proclaim it; radios screech it,
our favorite crooner coos it; and movies illustrate it. Yet, I
wonder if all this advertising is as eﬁective as it once was. It’s
been going on for a long time now, and nothing can stay new
forever. , -

Suppose each of us could be transported in some mystic way
The
inﬂuence of pictures and paragraphs would pale into insigniﬁ-
cance in comparison with this actual personal experience. I
wonder how many of us could come back and say smugly, “I’m
buying all the bonds I can afford,” after an hour in a damp,
soggy, blood-spotted foxhole on Leyte. I wonder how content-
edly we could sleep after “sweating it ou't” with a ground crew
waiting for a ﬂock of heavies. to return after a visit to Tojo.
Would our life hold new meaning for us, after an hour behind
the sullen barbed wire of a Nazi prisoner-of—war camp? After
seeing the forlorn smile on the face of the tall young ﬂyer saying
goodbye to his bride, as he departs for destinations unknown,
could we go out and joy ride on black market gas, the gas
which in some foreign sky will keep life surging through his
plane?

Of course, we can’t swap places with any of them, -but if
we could, what a change in our outlook would result! We
wouldn’t concentrate on post-war plans and neglect the victory
necessary to bring them about, if we were face to face with the
unrelenting fury of this greatest of world conﬂicts. We can’t
see these things ourselves, but we can remember that only the
unquenchable spirit of our men and the enormous supplying
power of our war bonds are keeping us from seeing them. And
most important of all, we can remember that the need for con-
tinual bond purchases is as vittalas ever, and we must keep
alwaysin mind that the message of the Sixth ‘War Loan must
remain stamped on the consciousness of everyone of us.

, One day, whil.e I was walking down Diamond street, I was
struck by an odd contrast, a study in the perverse nature of the
human beast.

The junction of Diamond, Liberty, and Ferry streets was
the scene of the crime. On my left, supporting the wall of the
largest food market in the world, formed a queue of civilians

- waiting patiently in line for a pound of butter, all oblivious to the

Red Cross appeals for blood in the display window just at their

screaming posters at the Wabash station, was another line wait-
ing to stock up on bacon. THE BACON SUPPLY IS LIMITED.
Across the street, 011 Liberty avenue, Pittsburghers were wildly

jamming the doors of a drugstore that had just gotten in a sup-

While at the Wabash station all was peace and solitude.

gamin pigeons that pecked greedily at the crevices for break-

We m.ustn’t neglect to give blood just because the headlines
say we’re winning. Remember that when we’re winning it’s be-
cause we’re throwing more resources against the enemy and
therefore losing more men. Last month, our plasma stock in
Europewas so low that the British had to supply our casualties.
MUST WE DEPEND ON WARNVEARY ENGLAND FOR OUR

By Lee Mclnerny

into The
Pitt News ofﬁce Monday afternoon

Joe Hoeblow burst
and waved the November 22
issue in my face.

“Do you see this?” he screamed,
and ‘the veins in his neck turned
a ghastly red. “Do you see this?”

I couldn’t help seeing it, since
he was practically curling my
eyelashes with it.

“Now take it easy, Joseph,” I
said. “Just what’s your trouble?”

“Trouble!” poufed this lad, who
is now a sophomore after four and
a half years of «hard plugging.
“That isn’t the word -for it. It’s
scandalous!”

“You may -"tell me about it,”
said I generously.

“Do you see this list of student
tappees of ODK? Do you see any-
thing wrong with it?”

I looked it over. “No. Those
boys are all certainly deserving
of the honor.”

“Keerect, keerect! But where
are all the rest of the fellows?
Just show me, now!”

“Just what fellows do you
mean, Joe?” I asked cautiously.

Joseph sputtered. He lookeiiiat
me as though I were the epitome
of rank ignorance. “Why, the
fellows who should have been
tapped and weren’t! Write a col-
umn on it, Lee; Write a column.”

I started to usher the little boy
out of the ofﬁce. “Son, you’re
speaking of something I don’t
want to touch. Go to see someone
else about it. In the first place, I
think the members who tapped
the boys are -capable of choosing
whom they want, and in all fair-
ness. In the second place, this
list of names you’re so freely
shoving in my face may have
deﬁciencies that you don’t know
about. Did you check on their
activity points and their scholar-
ship achievements?”

-. “No, but . . .”

“Then leave, my boy.”

As I pushed him out of the
door, he assumed a hurt expres-
sion. “If I were the only one to
feelgthis way about it, it would
be different. But,” (with a mar-
tyred voice) “there are many,
many others. And we thought
you'd at least write a column on
it to express our feelings.”

“All right, Joe.” Wearily, I

accepted the list of names. I don’t
intend publishing them. He
beamed at me, then rushed down
to the Tuck Shop where he has
all his classes.

Now I sit, waiting for the criti-
cism, the comments, and the
inevitable deluge of people who
have been affected. I, myself, have
no personal -opinion regarding the
matter. This column was written
only because Joe Hoeblow (and
friends) wished it. You may
charge with your bayonets.

serving V-E (Victory in

Brazilian Finds
Pitt Friendly

The School of Applied Social
Sciences at the University of
Pittsburgh, as one of nine chosen
by South Americ'an students for
graduate study, is doing its part
to further the Good Neighbor
policy.

Helen Junqueria, nead of a
social science school at Sao Paulo,
Brazil, came to Pitt because it
offered the type of course and fac-
ulty best suited to her work. Miss

J unqueria is very much impressed ,

with the friendliness -of Pitt and
said she was made to feel at home
instantly. “My only difﬁculty was
getting used to classes conducted
in English,” she explained.

Miss Junqueria ﬁnds it unusual
for a university to have so many
schools all in one building; but
she likes the idea, because there
can be an interchange of ideas,
help from other schools, and the
use of many libraries. She also
likes the informal atmosphere
here at Pitt.

Miss Junqueria, who has been at
the university about seven weeks,
is one of a small group of South
Americans studying social work in
the United States under United
States government subsidy. She
expects to return to Brazil after

= her course is completed and con-

tinue her social service work
there.

Dean “On Time, Too’I’”Connell?y

Reigns Over Pitt Equipment

This is to be strictly a civilian secret, but you wouldn’t be study-

for a certain little man in the buildings and grounds department, Way,
way down in the basement of the Cathedral.

George Connelly, known as George or “Dean” to almost every-
one, handles practically all of the equipment for the University—-
plumbing, parcel post, electrical supplies, books and chemicals—oh,
the list stretches and stretches. Technically speaking, George is a

C Le r k. Speciﬁcally
speaking, he’s a receiving clerk, a
shipping clerk, a tool room clerk,
and a truck foreman. All this has
been going on since 1922, when
George ﬁrst started Working for
the University.

As for experiences since then,
“Dean” Connelly certainly has had
them! An all—around handy man,
he’s asked for special help at any

and all times from various sources. .

One of his favorite stories arises
from one of these occasions.

“There was a gas leak in the
basement kitchen of the Cathedral
one night, when the army per-
sonnel .was stationed here,” he
said. “I was asked to help“ move
all the food from the basement
to the cafeteria on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
so that 800 air cadets could’ have
breakfast in the morning. We
stayed up all night to move the
food, and you can just bet the
army was fed the next morning-
and on time, too.” ‘

George’s busiest days were dur-
ing the time of the Civil Works
Authority, when the outside ._of the
Cathedral was being completed.
During those months, he handled
tools for over 1,000 men.
busy, very busy,” sighed George.

He also didn’t have an easy time
of it when the army personnel Was
much larger at Pitt. ‘‘I worked
16 hours a day, seven days a week.
The army cooperated in every way,

though, so it was really lots of’

fun. “In fact,” he concluded, “it
has always been a pleasure to
work for the University.”

No doubt that last statement
has made you realize “Dean” Con-
nelly will be passing on your
books and test-tubes for a: good
many more years at Pitt—-“and on
time, too!”

tion.)

A. F. of M. LOCAL 49%,
Special Communique G

Last week Victor and Columbia
joined their satellites Decca,
Brunswick, and one hundred other
record companies by signing un-
conditional surrender terms with
our boy, Caesar. In just twenty-
seven months General Petrillo’s

"forces decisively crushed the com-

bined forces of ‘Victor, Columbia,
the Supreme Court (for the fourth
time), and the U. S. of A. headed
by President Roosevelt. It is
highly commendable that after be-
ing forced into conﬂict by the big
bad record capitalists the many
p o o r, woe-begone, emaciated,
peace-loving musicians will at last

— have the services of a fund which

will provide for the advancement
of musical culture in such places
as Hotsenfelder’s Ferry, Oregon
(which is just across the river
from Lower Meat Whistle, Wash-
ington). Well done, Caesar!
Bravo! Bravo! The glorious news
was reported to General Petrillo
via long distance telephone by the
frustrated representative of the
combined record moguls. When
pressed for a statement our Com-
mander said “Sic Semper Tyran-
nis.” (i.-e. Thus always to tyr-
ants.)

In the above way the nation’s
press has insulted and poked fun
at President James C. Petrillo of

the Musicians‘ Union. Before con-
tinuing further let me say that I
for one am one hundred per cent
behind Petrillo. I, together with
the great majority of musicians,
believe that he is one of the all
time great leaders in the music
industry. It is very easy for the
nation's press (which is controlled
by the same men that control the
recording industry) to paint a
black picture of the so-called dic-
tator in our midst. It is very easy
for them to at least partially con-

vince many Americans who be-
lieve only what they read in the
papers. But the pu-blic doesn’t
hear how Petrillo raised the music
industry from the very depths of
economic and social levels to an
industry with a reasonable chance
for expansion and development in
the future. No, the public doesn’t
hear of the days when ﬁrst-class
musicians were making three dol-
lars a night and wondering where
their next meal was coming from.
Personally, I'll take the man of
progress even if he has to step on
the toes of a few so-called big
shots in this country who want to
keep everything they have and
grab everything else they can get.
So bravo, Caesar, bravo! I for one
am behind you.

Frosh Health Rate

Improves In 411
Freshman women who entered
the University in June and Sep-
tember 1944, are healthier than
those who entered in 1943, accord-

ing to statistics compiled by Dr.
Auleene M. Jamison, director of
the,women’s health department.

Of the 380 freshman women ex-
amined by Dr. Jamison, 313 have
an A health rating, 52 have a B,
and 15 have a C. The B rating is
due to minor physical defects or
to asthenia, a weariness caused by
accelerated courses in school or by
working through the summer. The
women with C ratings have had
recent operations or have physical
defects which necessitate their
taking special work in gymnasium.
The number in the B grouphas
increased, but that in the C has
decreased. ‘

There are fewer severe eye con-
ditions, cardiac cases, and nutri-
tional problems than previously.
Dr. Jamison feels that Red Cross
and high school nutrition classes
have produced an increased na-
tional consciousness of both health
and food which is largely respon-
sible for the improved health of
college women.

Training Applied
By Retail Students

School will be out until January
2, 1945 for students enrolled in
the Research Bureau of Retail
Training.

The bureau students, who have
been working on Saturday and
Monday in seven d-owntown de-
nartment stores, started working
full time November 20 and will
continue until December 23. Their
work consists of supervising in
any department where they are
needed.

Of_ the 19 regular student en-
rolled in the bureau, seven are
Pitt seniors, two are Pitt gradu-
ates, and 10 come from other col-
leges. Beside the regular students
some department store representa-
tives are doing the same kind of
work.

Ruth Branigan, assistant profes-
sor of advertising, feels that this
work not only aids the department
stores, since they ‘are short of
clerks, but that it helps the stu-
dents to “apply their nine weeks
of solid thorough training.”

THE PITT NEWS

By Ursula Halloran

Psi O pinning this week, as a
follow-up on a column of a couple
of weeks ago, involves Jim Reber
and Jo Ann McGhee.

G i n n y King’s Thanksgiving
week-end cost her a ﬁve pound
box of candy, but rated her a
third ﬁnger, left hand ring. It
came from Carl Werlich.

And now for our latest feature,
the whothehell care.s department:
Ann Whitlinger can now bend her
knee (the auto accident, you fools,
the auto accident); ask Norm
Weissman what’s new up at Mich-
igan these days; the Beta Sigs eat-
ing fried eggs at Annette Coryea’s
house at three o’clock Sunday
morning (isn’t there something a
little more appetizing?)

Tri-Delt Homecoming Queen is
( s c o o p I ) Dick (Hose-Nose)
Briney. It was a tough ﬁght, but
he made it. (Frankly, we expected
to win ourselves on a write-in

ballot, but it seems that 27 times

weren’t quite enough times to
vote.)

Tension at the Zeta house Sat-
urday nite was thi-ck, what with
all members of the Jack Mount-
ford-Pattie Watt-Jack Davis tri-
angle present. The s-core we don’t
know; who’s flufﬁn’ and who’s
bein’ ﬂuffed?

Last Tuesday night the TPAs
celebrated the big sing by drink-
ing champagne (are you sure?)
out of cups at the G. B.

Saturday was Pitt night at
.Mazur’s. Phi Gams were with
fresh that night—John‘ny Ridinger

 

and Dick Barnhart

with Helen Reis, and Ray Yourd
with Ginny Barker.

’Twas good to see June Thom-
son and visiting Bob Burford
coupling again. Burf promises to
be in town for the IF.

Speaking of IF, which stands
for “IF I have a date I’ll be
there,” do you have a date? If not,
don’t despair.

Milt (Date-Switcher) Tokash
had a “ﬁne” time at the Sig Chi’s
‘hay ride Friday. He and Lou
Tierno enjoyed each other’s dates.

Headline news of the week con-
cerns Sylvia Herzberg’s spine. It
seems that she threw the thing
completely out of place in gym
class the other day. (What a sight
that must have been. That snaky
look, ya know.) - _

From the Kappa Korner we
have a catastrophic report!
(Sounds like a naughty word,
don’t it?) Bill Humes. and Jean
Walther aren’t pinned anymore.

At random we saw: J. C.
Thompson home and doing all
right at PCW with Jean Wallace,
who’s wearing his Delt pin now;
Marion White’s two dozen curtain
calls (not all hers, there were
others in the party—Dick Hudson
and six Lieutenants from Tech);
Ann Monteverde’s letter to Santa.
She wants a soldier named Bill
Henderson for Christmas; Lola
Ward’s and Jean Schorr’s obstacle
course from Wheeling to Pitts-
burgh on a cold, wintry night.,

now?) A

Editor’s Note: This is the ﬁrst
of a series of personality sketches
of Pitt students to be presented
monthly in The Pitt News.

“In my high school days, they
called me shadow,” says Bob
Buell, C, business manager of the

1945 Owl, and he ad-ds, “Here at
Pitt, my latest nickname is Bub-
bles.” When asked to state prefer-
ence, he replies with an amused
grin, “No comment.”

However, all kidding aside, the
genial gentleman behind what is
the busiest desk in the" Owl oﬁice
these days is very ‘well known on
campus. His activities include:
Heinz Chapel choir, religious
chairman of ‘the YMCA, Druids,
and Men’-s glee club. He is also
house manager and treasurer of
Delta Tau Delta. Bob attended
Wilkinsburg high school, where
he was business manager of the
school paper and a member of -the
activity board. He also attended
Allegheny College before trans-
ferring to Pitt.

Bob’s boyish face and sandy
hair somewhat belie his real busi-
ness ability. Nevertheless, after
watching him in action in the
bustling and crowded Owl oﬂice
for a while, his executive abilities
soon become quite apparent. He
manages to combine an easy—go-
ing sense of humor with a serious
purpose in life, as after his grad-
uation in May he plans to study
for the ministry at Drew semi-
nary in Madison, New Jersey.
Bob’s vital statistics include:

Height . . six feet.
Favorite sport . . bowling.
Favorite song . . . “Till Then,”

sung by the Mills -brothers.

Pet Like . . . Food.

Pet dislike . . . Inefﬁciency.

His hobbies are printing and
singing. When it comes to women
(and it does come to all of us,
doesn’t it?) he prefers brunettes
and likes his gals to be the “ag-
gressive type.” (Editor’s note: See
Buell f-or explanation.) Bob holds
a “live wire” interest in his work
on the Owl and takes leave of
people with the following choice

Explained by H ovey

In a recent lecture at the Cara‘:
negie museum Walter Reed Hovey,
head of the department of ﬁne
arts, presented his explanation of
the ﬁrst prize of the, Carnegie art
exhibit, Room 110, by Yasuo
Kuniyoshi.

Mr. Hovey stated that the idea
Kuniyoshi may have suggested in
this painting is the we.akness of
present-day civilization. The um-
brella, the tea rose, the bunch of
grapes, the crumpled sketch of
paper, the broken cast, and the
white vase, things with which we
are all familiar, may represent
the ideals of the current world
structure and the precarious man-
ner in which these objects are
placed on and about the ﬂimsy

Officers Elected
By French Club

At their ﬁrst meeting this
semester, Le Cercle Francais,
elected the following officers:
president, Judy Malone, C; vice
president, Sarah Demase, C; sec-
retary, Betty Jean Bendel, C; and
treasurer, Alice Wanger, C. Sarah
Demase heads the program com-
mittee which includes Yvonne
Roebuck, C; Louvoun Grob, C;
and Susie Davidson, N. Adrienne
Aldisert, C, is in charge of pub-
licity.

A program of French movies is
being planned for the group.
Members of the club bring their
lunches every other Wednesday
to the YWCA office where they
carry on conversation entirely in
French and sing familiar French
songs.

Miss Blossom Henry, club spon-
sor, has announced that all stu-
dents with a requisite of French
4’have been invited to join the
-club.

There will be a meeting of
the Owl advertising staff in the
Owl oﬂice today -at 3:30 o’clock.
It is important that all staff
members attend and bring with
them their reports of the work
done.

table suggests ‘the imminent col-
lapse of that structure.
According to Mr. Hovey, Kuni-
y0shi’s rejection of the Oriental
influence may be noted in his use
of the homely black umbrella and
the plain white vase, both being

of a -deﬁnite Western nature. Then, .

in contradiction of himself, Kuni-
yoshi renounces ‘the Occidental
trend in the colors. Mr. Hovey
-terms the many curiously-matched
and delicate shades tragic colors
which are pretty but not beauti-
ful. In this aspect Kuniyoshi
reasserts his Oriental background.
Thus ‘the artist, at one time stress-
ing his native Eastern strain and

at another his -adopted Western"

environment, is _a product of both
cultural worlds, yet belongs dis-
tinctively neither to one or the
other and so, in a sense, is a lost
soul.

Pursuing the aesthetic point of
view, Mr. Hovey added that as a
composition Room 110 is a ﬁne
piece of work. There is a direct
relationship -of all the -objects to
each other which gives unity to
the whole picture.

The aforementioned coloring is
an important feature in the beauty
of composition which gives a
charming and whimsical quality
to the picture. '

Room 110, a work typical of
Kuniyoshi, reveals the subtle
approach of its -creator and can
be judged as one -of the foremost
examples of non-objective paint-
mg.

 Phi Eps Cop[F

Grid Championship

PiKAs Downed, 18-0

A ﬁghting Phi Ep team grabbed the championship of the IF Foot-
ball League by defeating a determined PiKA squad, 18-0, in a deci-
sive game on Monday. Playing on a muddy gridiron, the PiKAs were
unable to use their superior weight to any advantage as the speedy
Phi Eps ran their way to victory and the title. The PiKAs dominated

the ﬁrst -quarter.

Pi K A’s looked like a shoo in.¢

Then, it happened . . and with
a roar. ‘The Phi Eps who, had been
battered and bruised from goal-
post to goalpost, suddenly came to
life. A PiKA punt was blocked.
That was the turning point. The
Phi Eps began blocking, running,
and passing with a spirit that was
inspiring. Olt was the kind of a
winning ﬁght that all men secretly
hope to wage against seemingly
insurmountable odds. After that
ﬁrst break, a ’ quick touchdown
thrust followed. From then on, the
Phi Eps dominated play until the
ﬁnal gun sounded as shadows of
darkness shrouded the ﬁeld..

Upon the outset of the Phi Ep-
PiKA game, it appeared as if the
favore-d PiKA’s would win again.
However, a rejuvinated Phi Ep six
had too much courage to let this
pass. Early in the ﬁrst quarter

kicking duel between Simon of
the Phi Eps and Wood of the
PiKA’s. The ﬁrst real break came
when Lubic intercepted a pass
intended for Wood. Racing down
the sidelines, he dodged several
PiKA’s, only to be trapped on the
thirty yard line. At this point he
lateraled to ‘Seewald who fought
his way to the ﬁve yard line. On
the next play from scrimmage,
Lampl ﬁred a short pass to Pearl-
man in the end zone. In despera-
tion the PiKA’s attempted a come-
back only to be thwarted when
Fenstersheib recovered a PiKA
fumble on the goal -line. Lampl
aided by the blocking of Weiss-
rnan promptly completed a pass
to Peanlman for the ﬁnal score.

Both teams exhibited clean
sportsmanship which has always
been present in the league games.
The league ended with the Phi
Eps sporting 6 wins and 1 tie, the
PiKA’s close behind with 6 wins
and one defeat, and the Delts in
third place with 5 wins 1 loss and
1 tie.

In the anti—climatic games of
the Week, the PiKA’s defeated the
Delts 12-6. The PiKA’s scored
early when Wood intercepted a
pass and outran the Delt team

for the score. The Defts tied the
score when ‘Thomson passed to
Buehl, with 23 seconds remaining
in the game Gallagher attempted
a long desperation pass which
bounced off the arms of three
Delts only to be caught by Wood
in the end zone. This defeat elim-
inated the Delts from the league
championship.

In the only other game of the
week, the Phi Eps defeated the
»SAE’s 30-0. The muddy ﬁeld ham-
pered the play but superb block-
ing was the standout feature of
the game. The ﬁrst of a succession
of scores came when Lampl threw
a long pass to Seewald who out-
ran the SAE team for a touch-
down. The other four scores came
on a assortment of runs and
passes. Outsanding for the -SAE’s
was A1 Sciullo whose ﬁne all
around playing caught the fancy
of all the onlookers.

Panther Win
Happy Ending
For Gridsters

Although the game with Penn

State is over and the '44 football
season is all but a memory, there
were still some high spots of the
season which no one will forget.
Pitt was deﬁnitely keyed up for
the contest with State and the
bulwark of the Pitt defense, the
line play, Was undoubtedly the
turning factor.

During the half time intermis-
sion, Coach Shaughnessy must
have really induced the Panthers
to go to town. Bernie Sniscac took
the kickoff on our seven yard
line and started straight up the
center of the ﬁeld. His interfer-
ence formed to the right and left
and bowled over the Penn State
team. Bernie kept on going‘
straight up the center of the ﬁeld,
and, once he broke through the
two or three closest tacklers, he
was off to the races, galloping
down the north sidelines for the
neatest touchdown run of the sea-
son. His jaunt was somewhat
reminiscent of the ‘dash that
Primo DeM*atteo performed against
Minnesota some years back.

After Sniscac’s journey of 93
yards for the initial pT.D. the Pitt
cheering 4
crazy. Hats went ﬂying into the
air, hands went ﬂailing about and
the cheerleaders turned somer-
saults, cartwiheels and threw mud
at each other.

Our “Raw-Raw” «boys were
really on the beam last Saturday.
Not only did they lead the Pitt
students in cheering, but they
were constantly on the move.
They were all over the ﬁeld,
tackling the State cheerleaders,
wrestling with the Lion, and
cheering the team on for their
goal line stand.

The long awaited-for coming

out for the Pitt band ﬁnally took L

place on Saturday. The band was
what had been lacking all year,

for with the appearance of the;

musicians the students seemed to
gather a great deal of spirit. Not
enough praise can be given these
boys for their swell cooperation
and excellent performance during

the halves and on cheers. .-

“Shoot that ball; pass ’em
harder; get your mitts on the ball.”
These shouts, and many more are
heard every day on the Pavilion
floor as the Pitt basketball Phan-
toms ready themselves for the
coming season. The boys are
about ready for real action, but
the schedule, isn’t, so they must
wait.

Dr. Carlson has the team about
sized up and it will not be long
before his deﬁnite choices are an-
nounced. Heading the list so far
are John Michalik from Ford City;
Canturno, a Freeport product;
Nate Apple, a Navy dent student
who was a standout on the varsity
last season; and Tay Malarky, one
of the highlights of Dr. Carlson’s
1942 quintet. Malarky was out
all of last season due to an injury
suffered in the grid encounter be-
tween Pitt and Notre Dame. Hank
Zellers has the center spot well
under control. Zellers is a Naval
med student who starred for the
Corbetts in the 'Muny Loop. Phil
Marder, another Muny League
court luminary, is also showing a
fine brand of basketball in the

practice sessions that are being
,held every day. Other boys who
have put a sparkle in Carlson’s
eye are Garnham, Jacobsen and
Spungen.

A few more boys are expected
to join the cage squad now that
football season is over. Leading
this group will be Constantino who
starred for last season’s Avalon
High quintet along with Morris,
another ﬁne prospect. The team
will officially dress up on Thurs-
day when the uniforms are issued.

70/talc/ta Know Mae?

By Moe Spiegel, Sports Editor

Things are getting mighty tough
around this place. Yep, mighty
tough. Just when I was about to

give up on the football team and
forget about the grid fame for a
while, the Panthers come along
and play the ball that everyone
knew they could do if they only
wanted to, and WHAM, Penn State
takes a trouncing. Boy, oboy, did
the papers in town do an about
face. Havey Boyle (notice that
I spell YOUR name correctly, Mr.
Boyle), Harry Keck, and Chester
Smith all were quite gleeful over
the Pitt triumph. They all wrote
with the “see I toldja they could
do it”_attitude. Oh well, I suppose
that a person enjoys a piece of
steak after eating hamburger for
so long.

He Who Waits——-

It took all season to provide
something to really talk about.
Now that the season is over,
everyone is still gabbing about
that 93-yard gallop by Bernie
Sniscak. That was really a lulu.
It seemed too good to be true.
With all the penalties that Pitt
was collecting, more than half of
the fans in the stadium felt that
the run would be nulliﬁed for
holding or clipping or something.
But it wasn’t (as if I had to tell
you) and Pitt had one of its most
welcome victories under a rather
loose belt.

Is Dr. Carlson Bashful?

I never suspected it before but
I now am coming to the conclu-
sion that Dr. Carlson (is there any
one who doesn’t know who HE is?)
is bashful.‘ Or, so it seems. The
good doc is just chock-full of
stories and he does not hesitate to
tell these little tales; but, Well——
I tried and couldn’t yank one from

iors. The ﬁnal score was 30-26.
Donna Shaver again proved to
be a standout courtwoman as she
made several shots from the mid-
dle of the ﬂoor. Ruth Chapiewski
was high scorer, however, with 18
points. Second in the scoring
column were Grace Ganter and
Miss Shaver, both with 14 mark-
ers. Gayla Nicely acted as referee.

him. Carlson, you might say, is a
slow starter. After a little coax-
ing, he will make with the Words.

It is the doc’s turn to start wor-
rying. Shaughnessy and his grid-
sters can take a rest, and do they
need one. But not for Carlson.
Nope. He and his gang are wait-
ing to get started on a schedule
that has yet to be announccil.
Doc gave me a little tip on Wing
is going to need the rest when the
season is over. “Did you ever
notice how many coaches die of
heart attacks?” This statement of
Dr. Carlson got me to wondering.
Seeing the puzzled look on my
face, the cage mentor proceeded to
rattle off a long list of names,
names that were impressive in the
sports world and still are. The
coaches he mentioned participated
in every sport, not just basketball.
“Did you ever notice how ‘many
coaches are prematurely gray or
bald?” My reply to that one was
“Yep.” Then I began to wonder
just how long the doc’s hair had
been the color it is. We all know

that Carlson is no youngster even
if he is always looking for a ﬁght.

I didn’t ask him about his hair,

however, but he will tell me when
I do ask him. That’s almost a‘
certainty. “The players will slow
down in a basketball game,” went
on Carlson, “because of the natural
instinct of self-preservation. But
the coach’s blood pressure will
rise during a game and stay at a
high level throughout the con-
test” The work of a coach isn’t
any soft job, from the looks of
things. This is another good rea-
son why it is not good to get ex-
cited. Just take it easy, every-
body. Take it easy and live longer.

materials urgently needed at the fronts and personal pack-

all civilian Christmas packages be sent before Dec. 1st.

So we of Railway Express ask you to help us (and

yourselves too) by doing these three simple things, in

addition to shopping early:

1. Send your gifts before Dec. 1st. Laundry can
keep to its regular schedule. When packages are

ready to go, phone the Railway Express agent.
2. Wrap your packages carefully and securely.

3. Address them clearly, with your own and their

By Buddy Lenchner and Margie Long

To begin, congratulations TPAs,
Chi Os, and Zetas; you prize
winning song birds of Inter—fra-
ternity Sing. Well, now I have
begun .

And so to continue, the Tri-Delts
under the leadership of Lois West-
bury, war activities chairman, are
becoming A-1 salesmen. They are
selling raffle tickets for a drawing
on December 11 at their house.
The prizes will be a $100, a $50,
and a $25 war bond and the pro-
ceeds will go to the China War
Relief Fund. Ten cents each or
three for a quarter is the price.
Sell a lot, kids!

Now for a great mystery, Pitt-
pourri may not have covered. Why
didn’t all the Kappas go where
they were supposed to have gone
the night of November 18?

The Phi Sigs have another en-
gagement to announce. Aileen
Lavine treated her sist-ers to a big
box of candy when she told of
her engagement to Lt. Harold M.
Cohen, a Phi Epsilon Pi who at-
tended ‘Pitt. Phi Sigma Sigma cele-
brated their Founder’s Day last
Sunday afternoon at their apart-
merit.

During Thanksgiving vacation‘
Delta Zeta president, Jackie Wil-
son, visited their Alpha Alpha
chapter at Northwestern univer-
sity to talk over old times with
the group ‘with whom she spent
her freshman year.

And now to conclude, the Beta
Sigs have planned a bowling party
for next Saturday night as one of
their weekly get-togethers.

After a week-end like this last
one I can’t write much of a col-
umn. Pm still hoarse from cheer-
ing at the game last Saturday,

Pitt Players’

The Phi Eps celebrated with a
dance at the Hotel Henry on Sat-
urday nigh-t. The boys all wore
white carnations to commemorate
their Founder’s day.

The Pi Lams are setting a
worthy example for the other fra-
ternities this Saturday evening,
‘They’re going as a body to the
show" and after-
wards they’re having a dance at
the house.

The P.i.KAs had a tea dance at
their house on Tuesday afternoon
for the Tri-Delts. No one remem-
bers whether or not they drank
tea, so I’m still in the d.ark about
that subject.

The Phi Gains also entertained
one of the women’s fraternities
yesterday. They had a party for
the Kappas at the Phi Gam
house.

In closing I might add (I have
to ﬁll space, so I might as well add
something), that my EIWO spies,
Marty and Harry report that this
year’s IF Ball will be a formal
affair at the William Penn, fea-
turing Bob Strong and his or-
chestra. That really promises to be
a big night for all frat men and
their dates. Addition is ﬁnished,
