Two Fraternity
Groups Contest

Council Election,

 

Interfraternity Council Split Over
Irregularities Charged In
Spring Balloting

 

That very horrid word which has
(logged campus political affairs for
these many semesters has again raised
its unsavory head. “Irregiilarities,”
a time honored Pitt noun, has been
taken from the musty ﬁles of rag-
paper editions of the News for the
ﬁrst time since Student council elec-
tions of last spring, dusted and hurled
at lnterfraternity council elections,
which took place at the April meet-
ing Tuesday night at the Phi Gamma
Delta house.

Smacking more of innuendo than
of mud-slinging, the charge was regis-
tered by a newly formed seven-fra-
ternity combine immediately after the
veteran fraternity coalition of SIX
houses succeeded in placing Robert
Vvillison, BA35, Delta Tau Delta, in
the presidency for next year.

Other ofﬁcers elected last Week
(and being protested now’) are: Jo-
seph Rodgers, C36, P111 _Ixal3Da. V109
president; Earl Israel, C30, Pi Lambda
Phi, secretary; and Robert Bowdler,
C35, Phi Gamma Delta, treasurer,

In the proverbial nutshell the
charges revolve about the fact that
the election meeting seemed, to the
accusers to have been clothed in
unusual cii-cumstances——circumstances
they say, which opened the way for
a landslide victoi‘Y_for ‘A1D_ha’ 00'
alitioii, now a minority group in couii-
cil.

The ﬁrst accusation is that the
present executive committee of the
council (soiid1v“A1pha”) failed to
signify in any way beforehand that
last week’s meeting was to Include
election of new ofﬁcers, a neglect
which was considered “ir1‘egu1a1‘;”
second, the usual method of_ inform-
ing representatives of the time and
place of the meeting was, for the ﬁrst
time this year, notfgmployed, 03118-
ing, say “Beta” coalition spokesmen,
three of their fraternities to be ab-
sent and losing for them their_ bal-
ance of power; third, the president
of council, during the course of the
meeting, either misunderstood or mis-
represented an article of the con-
stitutioii of the group to the_d1Sad-
vantage of the agg1‘1€V€d DaTU9S-

A new election will probably he
demanded by the defeated coalition.

“Alpha” combine, composed of six
of the thirteen campus social fra-
ternities, Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sig-
ma, Phi Kappa, Phi Gamma Delta,
131 I{appa, Alpha and P1 Lambda Phi,
has been in power not only in Inter-
fratei-nity council, but on campus gen-
erally for some time, possessing
inajoritv control of Student council
votes (and (lance chairmanships) and
of Druids, lioiiorary sophomore activ-
ities fraternity.

The “Beta” group sprang up,l_ast
seniester and includes the remaining
seven houses, Lambda _Chi Alpha, Phi
Delta Theta, Phi Epsilon P1. Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sig-
ma Chi and Theta Chi. Pi Kappa
Alpha was formerly a member of this
combine while it was still Omega
Delta, a. local fraternity, but switched
loyalty about the time of the Junior
Prom, the chairmanship of which
had been awarded by Student council
to H. Ellsworth Miller, BA, a member
of Omega Delta.

Besides the fact that no followers
of the “Beta." camp were notiﬁed that
elections were to take place at the
meeting, it is also contended by these
men that the neglect of the secretary,
George Stocker, C36, Phi Gamma Del-
ta, to send postcard notiﬁcation of the
meeting itself was particularly sug-
gestive of “irregularities,” as he is
not oniy bound by the constitution to

"issue notice of meeting,” but hasnot .
failed to do so for every previous I

meeting, They admitted, however, that,
except for one house, all fraternities
had been advised of the meeting by
telephone either on the afternoon or

evening of the election. Of the three_ _ _
“ ‘tries of the country increased operat-

fraternities not represented at the
meeting, Lambda Chi Alpha, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and Theta Chi, though,
the ﬁrst declared that the message
was not phoned until 6 o’clock that
evening, after plans had already been
made for a chapter affair which their
representatives, they say, unaware of
elections, were desirous of attending;
SAE representatives asserted that al-
though the message had been re-
ceived at their house, it had never
reached the correct persons (they

claim this would not have happened;

I
I
i

had postcards been sent); and Theta
Chi strongly maintained that no
message of any sort had been taken
at the chapter house.

M:-Claiii, in a statement to the News
declared: “This is not a ﬁght over
personalities —— over the individual

men who have been announced as the .

new ofﬁcers—but rather a protest
against the. methods the old coalition
has employed to save its face and
keep its strangle hold of political
bossisni when confronted by certain
defeat in a strictly regular election.”

Cathedral Guides

Hospitality Committee To Aid In
Building Finance Drive

Students at the University are do--

ing their part to make the “Finish the

Cathedral Drive” a success. Under
the direction of Theodore Biddle, as-
sistant to the dean of men, a hospital-
ity committee composed of 35 women,
under the chairmanship of Helen
Milliron, C35, members of Omicron
Delta Kappa, under the chairmanship
of William Havlak. E34, and members
of Druids, under the chairmanship of
Russell Connolly, C35, began work
yesterday acting as guides to show
people through the Cathedral.

The permanent schedule will go
into effect tomorrow. A group of six
or eight students will be available
for guides each week day from 2 to
5:30 o'clock, and on Saturday from
10:30 to 4 o’clock. Each student will
be required to work only one day in
every week of eight days. On Satur-
days, there will be two shifts, one‘
working from 10:30 to 1 o’clock, and
the other from 1 to 4 o’clock. Per-
manent headquarters for the hospital-
ity cominittee will be inside the Fifth
avenue entrance of the Cathedral.

In the main, the people to be shown
through the Cathedral will be possible
donors or workers in the campaign.
The inspection program is based on
the principle that Pittsburgh people
will be more interested in the Ca-
thedral and will work and give more
generously if they really see the build-
ing and appreciat its beauty and

Business Review Shows General
Improvement In Financial World

 

By John Hesselbein

General business continued to im-
prove through February and the ﬁrst
half of March, and most major indus-

iiig schedules at an accelerated rate
during that period. This was the op-
timistic report made in the current is-
sue of the Pittsburgh Business Re-
view,

The monthly magazine issued by the
University bureau of business re-
search pointed out many encouraging
signs, indications which seem to
prove that business is actually on the
upgrade, after over four hectic years
of falling graphs.

Even after making allowances for
increased prices, the total volume of
retail trade showed impressive gains.
This was especially apparent in the
sales made by downtown
stores, several claiming the largest
sales in four years.

The Review said freiglit carload-
ings in the past several weeks were
far above those for the same period
last year, and that the improvement
in the past two months has been the
ﬁrst sustained rise since last July,
when it rose rapidly to a peak, in
August, of 82 per cent of normal, only
to about 60,
where it has been hovering ever since.

This improvement in general busi-
ness, according to the Review, has re-
sulted largely from the exceptionally
rapid expansion in the automobile in-

(wmisom Israel had no “Beta” 01390‘ dustry and in the iron and steel in-
sition) showed that “Alpha candidates dustry, with the increasing prod-uc-

Other three other related industries such as the

have expanded operations sub-

Coal production has risen some-
what during the past six weeks,

whereas a seasonal decline is to be
expected at this time of the year.
The recent apprehension in the au-
tomobile and steel industries has at
least tentatively been settled, the
steel industry annouiiciiig a pay iii-

gestions by NRA officials relative to
i'urt.lic-r reductions in working hours
and inci'eases in pay are causing
some uneasiness, the Review claimed.

Manufacturing employment and pay-

rolls showed unusually large increases I

in F€‘i)l‘l,‘i2ll‘}'. According to the U. S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, employ-
ment 6.1 per cent, and factory pay-

rolls increased 12.6 per cent from Jan-E _ _
; We-niens

nary to February, the increase being
substantially higher than is usual for
that period of year.

Business in the Pittsburgh district
made large gains through February
and the first part of March, after 18%-
ging behind the rest of the country be-
fore that time. «

g A new, powerful, specially designed
Elightliouse lens replaces the neon
fbeacon atop the forty-secoiid ﬂoor of
[the Cathedral. The new light, ex-
gplained Dr. John G. Bowman, Chaii-
'cellor of the University, at the dinner
which took place at the official light-'
ing of the new beacon and to which
were invited many of the outstanding
industrial and business leaders of
Pittsburgh, is a duplicate of the two
,ii:-:hthouse lenses in use at Panama
canaL

The men attending the dinner are
to_ assist in the coming drive to com-
plete the Cathedral and the chairman
of the drive, Mr. ‘Williams, presided.

The light was installed under the
direction of Ray Coss, superintendent
of the office of buildings and grounds,
and Edward McLain, assistant busi-
HBSS 1113113391‘ of the University. Work-
l_11en Carried _the _heavy mechanism
from the thirty—sixth floor to the
fortieth and installed the new lens
at the top most part of the tall build-
ID“,

:The light, Dr. Bowman pointed out,
is intended in its illumining of the
heavens to stand as a symbol of Pitts-
burgli’s aspirations, which will be fur-
thered by completion of the building,
the tallest university in the world,

According to H, S. Hower of Car-
negie Institute of Technology, the iii-
veiitor and designer of the light, the
new lenses are nearly a yard in diam-
eter, weigh more than 100 pounds
each, are valued at more than $2,500
each and are made of hundreds of
sictioiis of glass. The lenses were ma.de
in Pittsburgh by the Macbeth-Evans
_I.. lass company under the supervision
,1-r=;‘ its designer. The lenses were re-

rciitly uncovered by C. V. Starrett,
fornier ‘editor of the Pittsburgh Rec-
ord, in the Carnegie Museum.

Dr. W. N. St. Peter, professor of
‘physics, who aided in the installa-
-tion of the liglitliouse lenses, says of
the construction of the apparatus,
“The refraction of light rays from
hundreds of curved surfaces has to
be ﬁgured out in exact detail. Often
many niontlis are taken up in ex-
periments. Tliere are many types of
glass, there is a great deal in the
polishing and grinding of each sec-
tion and the curve must be worked
out according to known formulas deal-
ing with the refraction of light. After
the designer has worked out his blue
prints, he must supervise manufac-
ture of the lenses even to the point of
training the workmen in the art.”

Applaud The Players

R. CARL CASS and his dramatic organization, de-

spite the diﬂiculties which they face, are doing
commendable work and deserve the plaudits of the cam-
pus. In the conditions imposed by physical circum-
stances at the University, the Players face almost insur-
mountable obstacles.

Cramped in small quarters in Alumni hall with the
men’s and women’s debating organizations, Mr. Cass’s
“ofﬁce” is certainly inadequate for consultation and for
the general activities of Players. The group itself has
a “central oﬂice” in a lone desk in the Cathedral. The
players rehearse in classrooms or wherever they can ﬁnd
ﬂoor space enough to move around. And yet, despite
these conditions, they manage to stage productions
which we compare with the best produced by amateurs
anywhere.

“The Torch Bearers,” the last production of the group
this year, was the ﬁnest piece of work Pitt Players has
done. It compares favorably with productions of insti-
tutions which l1ave schools of drama and with the best

of the little theater groups. The men and women who
are members of Pitt Players work tirelessly all year,
building sets and scenery, arranging properties, getting
costumes, rehearsing, and giving Pitt presentations of in-
disputable merit. VVe applaud you, Mr. Cass, and your

Players, for a real service to Pitt.

Elections Are Coming

HE PITT NEWS urges_every student on the campus

to take an interest in the approaching election for
representatives to the University assembly, Pitt’s new
governing group. The outstanding students on the Pitt
campus, presidents of honorary fraterliities, campus pub-
lication heads, heads of other activities, athletic repre-
sentatives, and others should apply for nomination. Any
student who is sincerely interested in the welfare of the
University and who has ideas about progress in curricu-
lum, athletics, publications, musical activities, student-
faculty relations, and other pertinent topics should ap-
pear before the nominating committee and ask that he
be placed on the ballot.

The Pitt News will ask each candidate to outline his
platform. Unless it is a platform for Pitt, we feel that
the candidate had better forget election day and concen-
trate on how he is going to pass that next exam. The
Pitt News invites students to send platforms to this
newspaper for publication. We are interested in Pitt
and a good government for Pitt. And we will encourage
and support students who show a similar interest.

Letters To The Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

Last week someone congratulated you for publishing
a. criticism on student attitudes toward war. You do de-
serve to be admired, not only for that article but for the
numerous others 111 which you gave the question a place
of‘clear-cut importance in the News. If is one of those
things that indicate that at a. university like Pitt there is
a broader sense of what education can mean in real life.

You seem to feel, however, that most students are
hopeless when it comes to arousing in them an interest
in peace. That is probably true in many cases. But I
believe that there hasn’t been the right approach tried.
It is taken for granted and much deplored that the
American college student has little interest in world af-
fairs. There is one thing that hasn’t been taken into
consideration. And that is, that it may not be uncon-
cern nearly so much as being out of touch with organi-
zations that discuss such problems, that keeps back
many opinions. There are many people who don't go
I0 1I1Clu‘iI‘Y, for example, who have definite ideas on the
questions discussed there, but who either cannot or
merely have never gotten into the habit of keeping in
touch with its meetings. They should be brought togeth-
er on this question of war.

If we are really sincere in wanting to arouse some stu-
dent feeling, shouldn’t we make an effort to appeal to a
greater number of students? Certainly there are a lot
of straight thinkers to whom the problem would appeal
if presented in a reasonable manner. You put the prob-
lem in Inquiry’s hands. But the number that regularly
attend that now doesn’t indicate the percentage of in-
dividuals who are interested in the question. To make
every effort with such a chance number would be to
fail to use the possibilities.

VVhy can’t the Pitt News hold a sort of publicity cam-
paign to ﬁnd out the real opinions on campus, by pub-
lishing ballots for the students and faculty, if interested,
to vote on one way or another on what to do if war
came? (Perhaps you would state it from another angle.)
Anyway, that would bring the students face to face with
the question itself and give it proper recognition as a
live issue. Then let Inquiry have meetings to discuss it
speciﬁcally, while it is ‘at the front.
mittee could plan some way to guide the discussion so
that so-me conclusions can be reached. VVe can then
see what position we as students can take. In that way
we would be getting down to the actuality of the situa-
tion and not just talking around the bush for the sake
of discussion.

But first of all We must make sure that genuine effort
has been made to reach all the students with an ap-
proach that appeals to their intelligence. Only through
some such an effort will we ever be able to work out a
practical means for students to express what they are
feeling about war and peace.

Sincerely yours,
ANNABELLE KNUPP, C37.

The Inquiry com-‘

Committee To Judge Entries
In Nation-Wide Contest

c...

Active participation had been ar-
ranged today for the students of the
University in the nationwide Mount
Rushmore National Memorial inscrip-
tion competition.

Chancellor John G. Bowman an-
nounced the appointment of Percival
Hunt, head of the English department,
as chairman of the University’s com-
mittee to receive and judge entries
submitted by all students. Faculty
members who enter texts on their
own behalf will submit them direct
iéo the Pittsburgh Rushmore commit-
ee.

Pitt's active part in the memorial
project follows the action of univer-
sities and schools throughout the
country. Leading educators have
landed the entire project as one of
the outstanding historical movements
of the world.

What is the memorial?

A national organization was formed
several years ago under the name of
the Mount Rushmore National Memo-
rial commission. It proposed the
carving in the granite sides of Mount
Rushmore in the South Dakota Black
Hills a monument depicting the na-
tion's glorious history that would last
more than a IIlllll0Il years.

Four immense ﬁgures, exceeding
400 feet in height, are being carved
on the east slope, These ﬁgures, as
well as the entire project, are being
carved under the genius guidance of
Gutzon Borglum, famous sculptor.
The ﬁgures are those of Washington,
Jefferson, Lincoln, and Theodore
Roosevelt,

national monument will be America’s
epic, carved in letters 13 feet high,
on the west slope. Here through the
ages, future citizens perhaps even in
a new civilization, will read what the
principles of American government
meant to those who founded it and
the succeeding generations that de-
veloped the ideals.

What is the competition?

That carven text will tell in 600
words the accomplishments achieved
through nine speciﬁc episodes of the
nation’s history. President Coolidge
originally was assigned the task of 5
writing that text. He died before iti
was completed.

Now an invitation is being extend-‘
ed to every man, woman, and child
to submit a text. The memorial com-
mission hopes to ﬁnd from the mil-
lions of entries already in the mak-
ing that one text which will form
the basis for the ﬁnal inscription.
The final selections will be made by a
national committee. President Roose-
velt is its chairman.

The commission’s invitation to the
country's citizens to have a part in
the monument is being extended
through the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph~
and associated Hearst newspapers.
That every participant can compete
on equal footing with all classes of
entrants, four divisions of awards
have been established as follows:
adults, university or college student,
high school pupil and grade school
pupil.

Awards in the college group are:
best in any college, $500 yearly schol-
arship for balance of his or her col-
lege four-year course; second best,
$300 scholarship for balance of his or
her course; third best, gold medal;

Nine Periods In American
History Due May 12

fourth best, silver medal; ﬁfth best,
bronze medal; pest in each college,
certiﬁcate of merit,

What is the subject?

The text entries must not exceed
600 words. The subject matter should
emphasize the beneﬁts gained by the
nation and its people through these
nine. speciﬁc episodes: 1—Writing of
the Declaration of Independence. 2—
Drafting of the American Constitu-
tion. 3—Purchase of Louisiana. 4-

lCeding of the Floridas to the United

States. 5——Entry of Texas into the
Union. 6-—l\/Iexican War and acquisi-
tion of California. 7—Settlement of
the Oregon boundary dispute. 8-—The
Alaska Purchase. 9—Building of the
Panama Canal_

Entries submitted by Pitt students
should be sent to Mr. Hunt, Room 219,
Alumni hall, and addressed for Mt.
Rushmore Competition. The entries
should contain the participants name,
address and school aﬂiliation. The
latter information is necessary for
proper classiﬁcation in judging.

All entries must be submitted by
12 o’clock noon, Saturday, May 12.
The four best entries from Pitt stu-
dents will be submitted to the Pitts-
burgh Rushmore Memorial comit-
tee, in care of the Pittsburgh Sun-
Telegraph.

Included on this committee are Dr.
Bowman, Dr. Thomas S. Baker and
the Very Rev, J. J. Callahan, as well
as other leading educational and pa-
triotic leaders. The selections made
by this committee will be sent to
President Roosevelt’s group.

Architect Linder Draws
German Room Sketches

Preliminary sketches of elevations
for the Cathedral German room were
submitted last Wednesday by lVlr.
Frank Linder, architect for the Ger-
man room in the Cathedral, to Mrs.

Effluvia

By Saul Weisberg

Poor Heywood Broun!

That charming columnist misses all the fun. He

writes columns for months and months about as many varied incidents and
accidents as he can possibly discover taking place in our society, and then,
feeling somewhat weary, decides to run off for a two weeks’ vacation in

which he can bask his 230 or more pounds in a Southern sun.

see Mr. Broun get his vacation.
time.

I was glad to

He had been talking about it for so long a
But it is rather a pity, for no sooner does he get away than up pops

this most delightful tempest in a teapot, the Wirt aﬁair, to furnish the long-

est and horsiest laugh in many a dull day. And Mr. Broun, whose satiric
comments are really the only ones that could do full justice to the case, is

away, resting his

heavy bulk and:

missing one of the best topics for-‘

discussion that has arisen in the last
few. years.

I may not be exactly fair to Mr.
Broun by intimating that Mr. ‘Wirt is
an object of ridicule worthy of Mr.
Broun’s talents. Yet it must be con-
ceded that the educator from Gary,
Indiana. has taken on an imposing as-
pect. Of course, all the credit does
not belong to Mr. Wirt. The various
conservative newspapers and other
publicity agencies who have been
hankering after President Roosevelt’s
scalp were only too happy when up
leaped this defender of American lib-
erties. They quite correctly saw in
Mr. Wirt an individual through which
all the conservative fears and opin-
ions might be strained, without great-
ly affecting in public opinion the real-
ly important reaotionaries. And so
conservatives jumped to the task, put
their shoulders behind Mr. I/Virt, and
the latter individual suddenly became
juicy meat for columnists and cor-
respondents.

I hope that Mr. ‘Wirt’s sudden prom- ’

inence doesn’t affect him too much. I
hope that it doesn’t turn his head.
Thus far, he has managed to restrain
himself to the publication of a series
of little pamphlets. But if he begins
to take himself too seriously, he
might reach the point at which he
will manufacture a. book. Now, a
book, despite the thousands that are
turned out, still retains a. certain holi-
ness, a certain importance. A book,
by its very nature, must be taken se-
riously. And a book by Mr. ,VVirt
would dispell the illusion that his af-
fair is something humorous, some-
thing that we can laugh at and then
disregard. VVe would realize that Mr.
Wirt is just another conservative with
a Red phobia and interests that de-
termine his views, not a rather mys-
tical creature, with information whis-
pered to him by some divinity from
above and purposes that are detached
from mortal desires and motivations.
For a book is revealing. After one
reads a book. one gets an insight into
the mental processes of the author,
and one sometimes picks up an opin-
ion of the author that is not always
complimentary. And then one would
have to read a book written by Mr.
W'irt, just to satisfy curiosity about
this individual who has so amazingly
used an elephant gun to shoot bebes
at the nonchalant ipersons cavorting
about in VVashington. And reading a
book by Mr. ‘Wirt, I have a hunch,
would be neither edifying nor amus-
ing. Of course, Mr. VVirt has not yet
written his tome. But give him time,
give him time. He will. They all do,
after they’ve done what Mr. Wirt has
done.

Mr. VVirt’s charges of revolutionary
designs on the part of the Washington
“brains trust” are, of course, simply
the product of an overwrought imagin-
ation bearing fruit through a. process
of immaculate conception. That opin-
ion holds true only if I have the same
opinion of what revolutionary designs
mean as does Mr. Wirt. I'm a. little
afraid to move into a discussion of
what a revolution must mean to Mr.
Wirt. Evidently, anything that has a
tendency to cramp the style of rugged
individualists is revolutionary to Mr.
Wirt. Then, of course, Mr. Wirt fears
that Secretary of Agriculture Wallace
might be revolutionary when he asks
the American people which way shall

they go: toward nationalism or inter- .

nationalism. ‘In Mr. Wirt’s comments
on Mr. Wallace, by the way, he seems
not to have realized that the Secre-
tary was only discussing nationalism
versus internationalism and not the
proletariat versus the capitalists.

And then Rex Tugwell, undersecre-
tary of agriculture, and Donald Rich-
berg, counsel to the NRA, have used
quite freely the word revolution. Mr.
Wirt fears that Mr." Tugwell and Mr.
Richberg may be not optimistic but
correct in their statements that the
revolution has con1e to the United
I believe that the two gentle-
men are being excessively optimistic,

their presaging the coming of a new
economic order in the United States,
their basis seems to be hope, rather
than fact. Personally, I haven’t seen
any red ﬂags waving over universi-
ties, nor have I seen any red borders
on college newspapers. At least, I
haven’t seen such red borders except
when the college football team do-
feats its age-long rival. Of course, a
revolution might come without red
ﬂags and banners, but after reading
conservative newspapers and maga-
zines, it would hardly seem a real
honest-to-goodness revolution. If we
are going to have a revolution, I want
the red banners and I want them to
wave wildly. For it’s been an illusion

of mine for a long time that the red

ﬂags are necessary. In fact, if we
can’t have the revolution with red
banners, then I won’t take the revolu-
tion. I’ll give it to Mr. Wirt, who
doesn’t seem to care what color the
flags will be, and even seems to be so
revolutionary as to accept a revolu-
tion without ﬂags. That’s sacrilege
to me, but mere pifﬂe to Mr. Vvirt. “A
revolution is a. revolution, no matter
what the accompanying baubles are,”
Mr_ Wirt would say. And quite right,
too, if somewhat severe.

Paying attention to Mr. ‘Wirt and
his accusations would be, of course,
rank silliness, as I was glad to see
the “brains trust.” understood. But he
has been too perfect a farcical charac-
ter for writers to ignore. They wrote
about him and did their best to be
funny. None of them, as usual, at-
tained the heights that Heywood
Broun might have reached. Mr. Broun
would have had the time of his life
with Mr. Wirt. Think of what he
would have. said and of the skillful
satire he would have turned out.

Twenty Years Ago
Today

By Irving Terner

The School of Medicine of the Uni-
versity was on February 24, 1914,
placed in class A-plus of the medical
colleges of the United States. This
rating is the result of a grading by
the Council on Medical Education of
the America..n Medical Association.
Up until this time the school has been
included in class A, but following a
close inspection, at the request of the
school, made by Dr. M. P. Colwell,
secretary of the Council on Medical
Education, the school has been placed
in the highest class possible. It is the
culmination of six years of re-organ-
ization, elimination, and concentra-
tion. The Medical School is in its
twenty-eighth year and has enrolled
125 students, of which 65 per cent are
residents of Allegheny County and 95
per cent, of the state of Pennsylvania.

‘There are now 27 medical schools
in the United States which are rated
in the A-plus class, while there are
altogether about 100 medical schools
in this country.

The class of 1910 was the ﬁrst to
place a. memorial here on the cam-

of those who graduated in that year
increase as time goes on.

Sutherland, Quick
Plan Room Drives
With Committees

Individual Campaigns Commence
For Raising Complete Quota.
During Cathedral Drive

Dr. John B. Sutherland, head of the
nationality division of the Cathedral
campaign drive, and his aide, J. G.
Quick, met Friday in the Cathedral
studio with a special international
committee composed of the officers of
the nine nationality committees who
have raised more than half their
quotas. The committees presented in-
dividual plans to raise their quotas
during the Cathedral campaign.

The Chinese. Czecho-Slovak, Ger-
man, Hungarian. Yugo-Slav, Polish,
Russian, Scottish. and Lithuanian
committees had representatives at
Friday's meeting. An example of the
divisions within each committee is il-
lustrated by the. Slovenian, Serbian,
and Croation sections of the Yugo-
Slav committee, each group having

one representative of the larger com-
mittee.

The entire nationality campaign
set-up under the main Cathedral cam-
paign is one of the ﬁve groups which
will work in the interests of the gen-
eral drive. The other four divisions
are the industries. initial gifts, citi-
zens’ committee, and women’s com-
mittee divisions.

ln the nationality campaign there
are two divisions: one composed of;
the committees which have already‘
‘raised more than half their quota,g
working under the leadership of Dr.‘
Sutherland aided by Mr. Quick; and-
the group of those committees who
have not raised one—half of their re-
quired quotas, who will work under
the leadership of Mr. Quick. Mr.
Quick and this group are evolving
plans to raise as much money as pos-
sible during the campaign drive.

Already the nationality committees
are organizing individual drives. The
Italian victory drive is completely or-
ganized, a11d will endeavor to raise
$25,000 in four weeks, beginning the
drive promptly at 9 o'clock Saturday
morning. The victory drive will be
headed by a. general and 15 colonels.
It will be divided into alumni and stu-
dent divisions.

Though many a student has been

and though robins are busily building
and moving into. new chapter h0uses,_
definite proof that it really is spring}
comes through an announcement by‘
Edward McBride,. C34, of the cabinet
of the College associaton.

For the fourth and last affair spon-
sored by that organization, the
Spring Formal, will take place this
Friday night from 9 to 1 o’clock, The
second-ﬂoor ballroom of the Univer-
sity club, one of the most beautifully
appointed dance ﬂoors in the campus
district, has been hired for the affair.
Music will be supplied by Fran
Eichler.

Tickets for the formal are now on
sale in the office of the College in
State hall, or with members of the
association cabinet for $2 per couple.
Membership tickets purchased at the
beginning of the semester will, of
course, be valid at the Friday formal.

McBride declared that there will
be absolutely no “bargain price” tick-
ets. He also warned against the prac-
tice of purchasing membership tickets
"previously sold to other students, and
stated that a strict watch will be
maintained at the door to guard
against this abuse.

Kappa Alpha Theta Buys

New House On Bellefield

 

Kappa Alpha Theta purchased a
new sorority house, located at Bay-
ard street and Belleﬁeld avenue, it
was formally announced today by the
Alpha Omega corporation of Kappa
Alpha Theta. The corporation in-
cludes the following Pitt and Theta
alumni: Mrs. J. Paul Baker, chair-
man; Miss Alena Horner, Miss Doro-
thy Satley, Miss Carol Farrar, and
Mrs. Homer Flint.

The house was the former home of
Colonel Hershman. one time owner of
the Pittsburgh Press, and for many
years a patron of the local chapter.
Colonel Hershman donated the furni-
ture for the house at 409 Neville
street which has been the home of the
Alpha Omega chapter since its install-
ation as a national fraternity in 1915.

In 1908, as a local sorority, Pi Theta
Nu, the group was the ﬁrst women’s
fraternity on the campus. The group

was also the first local group to go
national, becoming the Alpha Omega
chapter of Kappa. Alpha Theta in
1915.

Forum Surveys
Status Of Child

Dr. Teagarden Offers Method To
Eliminate Child Distress

 

Psychologists became sociologists
for an hour at the Psychology forum
meeting, Monday, March 26, when Dr.
Florence M. ’l‘e:a.garden. professor of
psychology, presented “A Brief Sur-
vey of the Present Status of Child
W'elfare.” The address featured a dis-

cussion of the effects which the de-
pression has had on child welfare and
the situation at present.

“Plato said long ago,” Dr. gar-
den stated, “that there are two cities
in one town: the city of the rich and
the city of the poor.” She said that
the economically competent cannot
understand the trials of the poor, and

Tea

cannot fully realize the plight of chii-;

dren who have been deprived of the
necessities of life.

“Many things hav. happened to
children.” Dr. Teagarden said, “which
cannot be measured in statistics. The
depression has had a devastating ef-
fect on the moral standards of chil-
dren. During the three or four years
of the depression, figures of juvenile
court cases have gone up. Last year,
however, the figures remained the

same. This may be an indication that A

economic distress was lessened dur-
ing 1933. Also, during the last few
years the number of children taken to
the home for truancy has gone down,
probably because the school was a
better place than home.”

Dr. Teagarden then pointed out the
effects of the national recovery pro-
gram on child labor. About 100,000
children from 14 to 18 have been
thrown out of labor. The new pro-
gram has also reviviﬁed interest in
the child labor amendment. This is
substantiated by the fact that al-
though only six states had ratiﬁed the
amendment up to January of last
year, 18 states approved the amend-
ment during 1933.

The Cam pus Scout:
The Weisenbaugh Case _

There has been quite a bit of talk making the rounds the past few days I
concerning the position that Heinie Weisenbaugh is to play on the 1934 edi-
tion of Jock Sutherland’s Golden Panthers.

It has been stated with assurance by several different individuals
who (if they are to be believed), actually run the team and let Suth-
erland take the glory, that the high-stepping Dutch flyer is scheduled
for a varsity halfback post when the fall rolls around, as falls often
do. This column has also been assured by several other gentlemen
that Weisenbaugh will retain his old post, that of under-study to Izzy
Weinstock, Pitt’s potential All-American full back.

If no one minds, and I’m sure no one does (Ed. note: you’re right; no
one reads down this far). I’ll attempt to take the case of Henry Weiseii-
baugh apart, and try to put it together for the best interests of the Pitt foot- ,
ball team as a unit. Naturally, I fear that what I say may have little affect, 4'
for the simple reason that Dr. Sutherland, and not myself controls the Pitt‘
team, which is well and good for the student body, the University’s athletic
reputation, and the gentlemen who hold bonds on the stadium. Disregarding
the above patter, we can now raise our hand, and go on with our story (Ed.
note: you had better; we're not paying by the inch).

Last year, Weisenbaugh was Pitt’s surprise package, the only
fullback in the country who could outrun any halfback on his squad.
The arranement was highly satisfactory as far as Pitt was con-
cerned, for the simple reason that Izzy Weinstock could go in and
batter an opposing line to pieces for three quarters, and Weisenbaugh
could follow up with some of the fastest running on any college grid.
Once Weisenbaugh was shaken loose, he was usually off for a touch-
down, or, at the worst, a very substantial gain. Weisenbaugh’s value
was especially appreciated in the latter stages of the game when the
opposing team was just tired enough to enable the flying fullback
to romp down the field. Even when the opponents had scouted the
Panthers and reported on Weisenbaugh’s speed, they were unable to
stop him. No team expects a fullback to outrun their fastest half-
backs, yet that is exactly what Weisenbaugh did. Check back on his
scoring record for 1933, and you will find out just what the Wein-
stock-Weisenbaugh combination meant to Pitt’s scoring chances.

This year, Weisenbaugh is a. senior, and many believe that he should be
given a chance at a varsity position, preferably halfback, instead of playing
fullback understudy for another year. Opposing Weisenbaugh for a halfback
post are Bob LaRue, Leon Shedlosky, Hub Randour, Leo Malarkey, and Mike
Nicksick among others. Each of the above, with the exception of Nicksick,
have at least one more year of varsity competition remaining after the 1934
season, and therefore, will be used whenever possible next season to give
them the necessary experience. Nicksick will likely ﬁll one halfback post,
and it is therefore up to Weisenbaugh to beat out the rest and provide an en-
tirly senior backﬁeld.

Weinstock, if he continues the pace he set last year, will not be
beaten out for the fullback post by anyone who seeks the position
now. Weinstock can smash the line with the best and better than
most, and he was the best man in the secondary defense last year.
Weinstock is too valuable to ride the bench for anyone, and will
therefore likely start at fullback. Most of the halfbacks that Weis-
enbaugh must beat out for a halfback position can pass and kick as
well as run the ball. Maybe Weisenbaugh can do the same, and
maybe he can do it better, but I think that the “Flyer” will not gain
a halfback post.

So we must come to a conclusion with a statement about something or
other. So be it resolved, that on the tenth day of April, in this year of
Depression, 1934, the Campus Scout makes a prediction: “That when the
1934 football season gets under way at Pitt, Heinie Weisenbaugh will be
playing reserve fullback, as he did in 1933, and that the result of such a
move will be to the advantage of the Pitt team as a whole, as it will cause
a multitude of touchdowns to flow in Sutherland’s direction. With that
schedule, the Golden Panthers will need them. Amen.” (After all, the foot-
ball teani is to be constructed for the good of the team as 3. UNIT, and
not for one man.

I’m sorry that I won’t be back next year to see whether my pre-
diction is correct, but l’ll have someone read me what's going on.
(Printer’s Note:. Someone read to you is right, you can’t.)

W

season for Pitt’s Golden Panthers
came with the naming of Claire
Cribbs, their star center, on the Lit-
erary Digest all-American quintet as
selected by Les Gage, noted sports
authority. Gage was aided in his
selections by an advisory board of
seventy-ﬁve prominent college coaches.

The Panther ace ﬁtted into a com-
bination of Cottom, of Purdue and
Krause, of Notre Dame, at forwards,
and Anderson, of New York univer-
sity, and Lee, of Washington univer-
sity, guards. Both Cottom and Krause
were named to first team positions on
the all-opponeiit ﬁve selected by the

Panthers. _

ln commenting upon the choice of
Cribbs for the pivot post, Gage said,
“Pittsburgh’s big, rugged jumper,
Claire Cribbs, is our center. He was
largely responsible for two late sea-
son defeats the Panthers adminis-
tered to Notre Dame. Cribbs was a
good ﬂoor man—an aggressive player
who was always on the ball, ﬁghting
 out for his teammates. He was a
deceptive ball handler, clever passer

at

and a capable all—around performer
who did eve;-ytliing well. The Pitt
cer.r.r-1' seldom failed to control the, Couple to

 at center jump and possessed ani
accurate shooting eye. This boy is the
latest of a long string of expert pro-
teges of Dr, H. C. Carlson, the em-
inent Pittsburgh coach.”

To top off the basketball season
with a ﬁne ﬂourish comes the an-
nouncement from the aforesaid em-
inent Dr. Carlson that the huge suc-
cess of the recent southern trip and
the generous welcome which has been .
afiforded the Panthers throughout the
realm of Dixie will ﬁnd another Pitt
excursion south getting under way in
1935.

During the Christmas holiday vaca-
tion the Pitt cagers will begin a trek
south that will wind up in Florida
and be followed with a more western
return trip. Invitations are already
on hand for games with Richmond
university, Duke university, North
Carolina State and North Carolina
university. The ﬁrst section of the
trip will probably include games with
