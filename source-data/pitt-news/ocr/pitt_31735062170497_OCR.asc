Survey Shows StudentElectian Apathy

by SHARON SEXTON
News Editor

A survey of college students on three of
Pittsburgh’s campuses, Duquesne, Car-
negie-Mellon, and Pitt, shows that students
support George McGovern or Richard Nix-
on with hesitancy and very little enthusi-
asm. As Nov. 7 approaches many feel they
are caught up in a dilemna of picking the
lesser of two evils.

This conflict is most apparent in Mc-
Govern supporters, who feel they could
never vote for Nixon, but don’t feel 100
per cent comfortable with McGovern.

’ “My objections to Nixon are intitially
subjective, but for the most part, they’re
backed up by fact. I think he is a callous,
shrewd political animal. I could never vote
-for him. So that leaves McGovern. But I'm
afraid that McGovern would he a failure as
an international politician. And as much as
I think our interestsjshould be shifted from
foreign to domestic concerns, McGovern
is too much of an isolationist,” said a stu-
dent at _Duquesne.

‘ Recent progress in the Paris peace
talks has robbed many McGovern sup-

porters of what had been their major issue
in the campaign. Their concern has shifted
to issues which they feel must be resolved
now that the end of the war is imminent.

Among these is a. change in priorities
from foreign to domestic concerns.

Many students agree with McGovern’s
programs for change in housing, welfare,
education. Of these, students, however,
several express an anxiety over McGov-
ern’s ability as a politician to realize these
programs.

“McGovern’s programs are groovy,
and they’re what we need. But nine of 10 of
his promises he’ll never be able to fulfill.
He just isn’t a dynamic enough politi-
cian," explained a Pitt senior.

During the primaries McGovern sup-
ported complete amnesty for draft dodg-
gers. Since his nomination, however, he
has modified his position somewhat.

‘ In attempting to explain McGovern’s ap-

parent indeciveness on the issues of am-

nesty and also abortion, a Duquesneco-ed
said, “I believe in McGovern. I hope he
felt that he had to play along with the sys-
tem and after he’s elected he will reassert

his position on these issues.”

Addressing himself to the question of
George McGovern’s indecisiveness, an-
other Duquesne student said, “Every pres-
idential candidate has platforms which he
knows are too idealistic to work, but can-
didates usually don’t admit this until after
election. McGovern’s problem is he’s too
honest for his own good. He shed the ideal-
ist image too soon and it made him look
indecisive. -

I Those students who support Nixon do

so because they like what he has done in
his four years in office and they think he
has earned another four. They admire
Nixon's “caution“ and are leary of Mc-
Govern’s “radical tendencies." Many ex-
press disgust over that they feel is a slan-
derous, mud-slinging campaign on the
part of McGovern.

McGovern supporters counter this by
arguing that it is Nixon who is waging a
dirty campaign because of his failure to
take the issues to the people.

“There are issues in this campaign
which desperately need to be clarified. But

Nixon knows it is not to his advantage po- -

illbeiaittiﬁem 5

litically to clarify them so he’s hidden him-

self away in the White House,” said a'stu- . .-

- dent at Carnegie-Mellon. ' V
One student was so disallusioned by the .

conduct of both ‘candidates during the cam-'
paign that he decided not to vote at all.
"These two are supposed to be the best our
country has to offer. Yet if you listen to
what they say about each other and believe

it you realize neither one deserves to be 

President.”

On all three campuses the McGovern ,1"

supporter is more visable and more vocal
than his Nixon counterpart. Those stu-
dents who do express an intention of voting

for Nixon do so with a certain timidity

which suggests that they are accustomed

to be challenged on their choice by their 

peers.

  Janeway

by BETH BELL _

A quiet woman with a soft voice
and graying hair stands before an
audience o_f female college stu-
dents and older women. “I see
women as human beings first who
happen to be female.”

The speakeris Elizabeth Jane-
way, a woman who believes in hu-
man liberation for men and wom-
en.

Janeway, author of Man’s
World: Woman’s Place, spoke
Wednesday night at Chatham Col-
lege on the “Role of Women in a
Changing Society.”

A well-known novelist, Jane-
way spoke_ on the women's libera-
tion movement in relation to his-
tory and anthropology, quoting a
study of two New Guinea tribes

.made by anthropologist Dr. Mar-

garet Mead.

Mead's analysis of the tribes
was that no temperment differ-
ences were seen between the sex-
es, including qualities of domi-
nence, courage, and objectivity,
state‘d Janeway.

Continuing to discuss the his-
tory of women, Janeway stated
that “in one ancient tribe, an ar-
tist had to be born with the um-
bilical cord around his neck. Two

- hundred years ago, our ancestors

believed that an ‘artist had to be
born with a penis.”

Mrs. Janeway statedthat "ma‘s

role is changing, too. It has been i

a man’s world, even if it isn’t to-
day.”

-“We stamp each other with la-
bels before we have a chance to

. know each other."

V Speaking about the trap men
also_find themselves in, Janeway
stated, “I have-sympathy for men,
but greater sympathy for women.”

Developing the theme of her
speech, Janeway said, “We see
women as interacting only with
the family." Citing several exam-
ples of primitive cultures, Jane-
way pointed out that in several
tribes. women are the traders,
and supply most of the agricul-
tural labor.

Janeway concentrated on des-
troying two myths surrounding
women, those of female weak-
ness and female power.

f‘Myths sustain the status quo.
They are easier to believe than
trying to figure out what to do.”

In describing the era of “Rosie
the Riviter,“ Janeway comment-
ed that 30 years ago women were
the center of the labor force.
working in aircraft and munitions
factories.

Women were urged to return to
the home after the war to make
room for men in the labor market,
stated Janeway, forcing them into
another role. “Women had to keep
house that a photographer from
the Ladies Home Journal could

walk into at 10 in’ the morning."

Attacks FeminineMyths . ‘

Janeway offers reasons for the
roles women have been assigned
in the past, simply being that
women bear children. “In past
times women were constantly
either pregnant or nursing chil-
dren, but women can now con-
trol their physical lives, and mus-

were discussed by Janeway, but

New‘Cata/ogue Format

The current CAS catalogue and
course description structure will
be scrapped and a new format for
the publication will be designed,
according to Dean Schneew-ind,
Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, and Ron Eskin, Chair-

I man of the CAS Cabinet.

Eskin said instead of one cata-
logue with outdated course des-
criptions, two new publications
would be published—1) a list of all
c'6iirses offered by the College and
its regulations to be sold for $1,
and 2) a separate book of course
descriptions and any material rel-
evant to the structure of, the
course, including requirements,
type of grading system, books
used, a list of those professors
teaching the course and the pro-
fessors background. "'. -

The meeting also introduced the

freshman pro-log program‘, ex-

pected to be in operation by next‘

fall. Under ‘this proposal, fresh-'1
man would be able to work with a_: '

professor for up to two terms,
being exposed to all sorts of mini-'

courses. It is hoped that this pro- I 

gram will allievate much of the
confusion and intoduct ry

courses that face the freshman _ '  '
student, and help him to better ad

just to college life. ~

_ Announcement was also made
at the meeting of the opening of
nominations for elected positions
on the CAS Cabinet.
ments for positions include: 1).

major; 2) the student must be . "

A coalition of existing women’s
organizations and interested in-
dividuals is being organized to
serve all women in the University
by providing a structure to effect
change. ‘

The proposal for a Women’s

. Center came in response to the
,Chancellor’s mandate to redefine .

the purpose and restructure the

 Advisory Council on Women’s Op-

portunities. Since the deliverance
of the mandate on February 8,

_ 1972, the ACWO met with various‘
 _women’s organizations and indi-

viduals to discuss the specific
concerns common to women with-
in the University.

From the information gathered,

the ACWO concluded, “A repre-

sentative organization forming a
coalition of existing women’s or-
ganizations and individualswould

ed behaviors and patterns of overt

and subtle discrimination.” The
proposal’s draftees feel the Uni-
versity is in need of more human-
izing influneces and that a‘ Wom-
en’s Center can meet this need by
cutting across traditional faculty,
staff, and student lines.

The problems the Center will
encounter, include maternity
leaves, health and day care, sal-
ary scales, fringe benefits, and
curriculum reform.

The Center does not intend to
only be a sounding board for
grievances, but also an informa-
tion center on women’s programs
and activities in the University,
in the community and nationally.
It will publicize relevant activities
on all levels.

The Women’s Center will also
sponsor special programs dealing
with specific issues of current
concern to women in cooperation
with other women’s groups.

The Women’s Center also hopes
to fill in the gaps that are now oc-

;

curring between the efforts made

by the major women’s organiza-

tions on campus. For example,
the Women’s Study Program is
taking initiatives into the aca-
demic areas of curriculum and re-
search to generate greater aware-
ness of women’s progress in the
past and stimulate current parti-
cipation. This new objectivity will
create and is already creating a
demand for services and informa-
tion that the WSP cannot fulfill,
i.e., child care or legal advice.
The center will assume this re-
sponsibility.

The Women’s Center plans to
be a more effective trouble shoot-
er and pressure valve for dealing
with the concerns of women at the
grass roots level. The center will

operate at some distance from
the administrative hierarchy
while cooperating with the Affir-
mative Action Office which com-
municates to the University on
more formal lines. '

Until the Women’s Center re-
ceives recognition by the Univer-

I sity Senate and receives alloca-

tions of office space, staff, and a
budget, the ad hoc committee is
holding meetings every Tuesday
from noon to 2 p.m. in room 1001
of the Cathedral.

Cynthia Vanda, acting Chair-
person, welcomes all response
and input in coordinating and pro-
moting the organization of the
Women’s Center -which has been
endorsed by the Student Govern-
ment. ’

past.”

After reading a poem by Phyllis
McGinley, Janeway described it
as “a naked celebration of (fe-
male) power in the home” and
lauded Norman Mailer for his
“romanticized and falsified” por-
trait of women, specifically the
“female ogre who bears men.”

Janeway, who stands as an im-
portant individual in the women’s
movement, and whose whispery
voice has entered the bloodstream
"of that movement, concluded by
saying she is “working for more

‘These statistics would seem to
indicate that in Pittsburgh at least
the younggvote might provide Mc-
Govern with the strength he needs
to seriously challenge Nixon.

The students’ attitude belies
this. Although they unanimously
agree that they are favor of the
legislation which gave them the
right to vote, they view the elec-
tion and their part in it with in-
difference.

They do not attribute the same

significance to their vote that
many political analysts do. Mc-
Govern supporters express a

sense of hopelessness and futility
as if they know they’ve picked a
loser, while Nixon supporters

are indifferently confident that
whether they vote or not their
man is going to win.

UAR to Begin Administering Course Evaluations

by LARRY PANSINO
The staff of the Undergraduate

. Academic Review will begin ad-

ministering course evaluations
for the winter term edition on
Wednesday, Nov. 8. Because of
the closed door policy at Pitt,
teachers may refuse to have their
courses evaluated.

Presently, only the Philosophy
Department has mandatory eval-
uation of all its courses.

In an effort to obtain evalua-
tions on as many courses as pos-
sible, the Review has instituted a
new policy. All teachers will now

have veto power over the evalua- '

tions of their courses. The UAR
will send them a copy of the eval-
uation for approval before publi-
cation; any evaluation rejected
will not appear.

The new veto option enables the

UAR to provide a service for the
instructors as well as students.

As in the past, the UAR will use
questionnaires to gather its infor-
mation; pointedquestions for spe-
cific appraisals will be included.
The evaluation will require about
20 minutes of class time and can
be scheduled anytime between
Wednesday and Dec. 8.

Any teacher wishing to have

his course evaluated should con-
tact the Center of Improvement

of Teaching at Ext. 364, or Room
928 Cathedral. .

Pitt Loses “Put-on" Debate

by MONICA CIROCCO

Pitt was a double loser this
Homecoming weekend, falling to
West Virginia, both on and off the
football field. -

On Friday, Nov. 3, the Pitt and
West Virginia debate teams clash-
ed over the question: “Is the Nix-
on-Agnew ticket part of an inter-
national Communist conspiracy?”

The debate was organized by the‘
‘Pitt team as a “grudge debate,”

but the audience was told in ad-
vance that it was a ‘.‘put-on” in
case they hadn’t already gathered
that fact from the debate title.

The Pitt team took the affirma-
tive position. Al Wynn cited four
major points that he considered
part of “Nixon’s Game Plan.”

First, he stated that Nixon has
one of the most convenient posi-
tions to act for such a conspiracy.
Secondly, he asserted that Nix-
on’s accusations that certain
world leaders are Communist are
mere “cover-ups”; these actions
actually contribute to the success
of the conspiracy. He \cited.Nix-
on’s foreign policy.as the third

piece of evidence, asking why, of
all the places in the world, he
chose to visit Red China and
Russia?

He answered his own question
by stating_ that Nixon actually
went to these two nations to get
more directions. Final1y,,in order
for a world «communist take over
to occur an internal revolution in
the United States must take place
and Nixon is seeing that it does.

Frank Cunningham began the
argumentfor the negative side.

He not only refuted Wynn’s points, __

he proposed the theory that Nixon
is not Communist, but a Fascist.

Cunningham claimed there can
be no international Communist
conspiracy if Communist nations
are fighting among themselves-
i.e., Red China and Russia. And,
if Nixon is a Communist, he ask-

ed, why does he go to church?_

Finally he asserted that Nixon is
an arch conservative who’s ac-
tionsare fascistic, asking, “How
can there be internal revolution
if the main point of Communism is
peaceful coexistence?” '

Jack Kennedy, the second Pitt
speaker, refuted Cunningham’s
points by noting that “Khruschev
wanted ‘peaceful co-existence’
and look what happened to him!
Furthermore,” he continued,

“Nixon goes to church merely to

obtain a moral leadership.” .

He then turned the tables on
WVU’s fascist argument by jok-
ing: “Oh, we don’t have to be con-
cerned, Nixon’s just a fascist! ”

Jon Pees concluded the negative
arguments by drawing correla-
tions between German fascists
and Nixon. “Nixon is an Indian-
giver because he gives North
Vietnam POW’s and then he wants
them back!” he joked, “Hitler
was an Indian-giver too! ”

Judge Bill Barnet of Carlow Col-
lege praised both teams for their
wit and cleverness.

He__awarded the victory plaque
to West Virginia, stating that they
were in a difficult position and
not only did a fine job of refuting
the affirmative side, but raised a
platform of their own to be dealt
with. ~

The next edition will.be pub-
lished and available in February,
before registration for the spring,
summer, and fall terms. Accom’-V
panying the actual course assess-
ments in the UAR will be the cus-
tomary articles of academic in-
terestwritten by UAR staff and
faculty advisors.

They were part of something
that began’ long before the Mc-
Govern campaign, part of a
great movement that found itself
engaged in the practice of de-
mocracy to an extent never be-

fore known in America. Mobil— -

izing a nation’s discontent they
deposed an incumbent president
in 1968, stemmed a military in-
vasion in 1970, and captured the
platform and nomination of the
country‘s largest political party
in 1972. And as unlikely as it
would seem. given the listless
state of university life today.
this‘ movement began on the col-

‘ lege campus.

It is difficult to tear away the
blinders imposed during this
campaign that «limit one’s ‘view
to the two__personalities in con-
tention for the office. But it
must be remembered that in
electing a president we are en-
gaged in selecting more than
one man, but’ in choosing a set
of political forces that will pre-
vail for the next four years. Jack
Newfield, a. speechwriter and
close associate of Robert Ken-

nedy and a delegate to this‘

ear’s Democratic Convention
Y

, helps put it all into some '~,per-

spective. He writes in “The Vil-
lage Voice”: ’

“Let me be blunt about Mc-
Govern."

“I will break my back cam-
paigning for him. but without
illusions. McGovern is a flawed
vessel for a great movement. Mc-
Govern is not tough-minded or
urban enough. He does-'3 not re-

Evaluate Nixon On
His Accomplishments

by WILLIAM A JOHNSTON III
College Republicans

It is indisputable" that over the past four years the world has
failed in achieving perfection under the Nixon Admininstration.
However, the criterion that one must use in deciding whether or not
the President deserves re-election is the improvements that have
been instituted since his inauguration.

First of all there has been more progress in the area of ‘civil
rights under the Nixon administration than in any previous admin-
istration. Therelare more women and members of racial minorities
employed in high level positions than in any previous administra-
tion.

In the economy inflation has decreased from six percent to 2‘/2
percent. The rate of unemployment has been continually on the de-
crease as we have shifted from a wartime to a peace time economy.
More Americans are employed today than ever before.

President Nixon in 1968 ran on a platform‘ of pledging to wage
a war on crime as it- was running rampent under the Johnson Ad-
ministration. The record shows that this objective is being accomp-
lished. The rates of increase is decreasing and there are signs that
if the President is re-elected that there will be a decrease in the ‘crime
rate. In Washington, D.C. there has been a decrease.

President Nixon is the first president that has declared the prob-
lems of the environment a national priority. ’

The activities of the military have been a most controversial
subject over the past decade. Defensespending in relation to the Gross
National Product is lower than it has been in twenty years. The
selective service-system is indisputably moreequitable than it was
four years ago. A settlement in the Vietnam conflict immenent.

The Democratic opponent on the other hand has been throughout

his campaign for and against bussing. He has been for and against ,

unilateral withdrawal’ in Vietnam. He has beenfor and against leav-

ing a residual force in Vietnam. He has been for and against am- ’

nesty, for and against legalization of marijuana, for and against.
guaranteed annual incomes just to mention a few. Democratic sup-
porter of the candidate, Hubert Humphrey, stated that “No respon-
sible president would advocate the magnitued of defense cuts that
he does that would result in leaving this nation a second class_—pow-
er.” His campaign thus far has time and time again continued to

mainfest his pathetic irresponsibility- Would you want this irrespon-

sible Democrat to be your President.’ I 1 _

In order for the President to continue his programs of improve-
ment and prosperity it is imperative that he gets four more years in
office. For that to occur he desperately needs‘ your vote and I urge
all Americans that want responsible government and leadership to
cast their vote for President Nixon this Tuesday. RE-ELECT THE
PRESIDENT!

Communist Clear Confusion

by NANCY BITENSKY
Hall-Tyner-Henderson Campaign Committee

The issues in the 1972 elections are without a doubt the most im-
portant aspect of concern for the -American people and people of the
world over. Thus the role of the Communist Party is tha't of clearing
up many issues used bythe two old parties to sow,the seeds of con-
fusion. ' - I

'1 ....We believe that the running of Gus Hall for President, Jarvis
Tyner for Vice-President and here in Pittsburgh Naside Henderson
for Congress in the 14th C.D. has in many ways moved the elections
further left. Of course, we understand that our party will not win
many seats in this election. Unlike other parties, we’re running on the
basis of the need forrreal change and not simply a seat in this or that

house. However, this in no way means that we’re_not interested in
votes. A vote for the Communist Party is the most important, long
lasting protest vote one can cast. In fact, it is the vote that will be
counted time and time again‘; -It--is the vote-that demandsjobs, hous-
ing, schools, hospitals, day care centers and peace from this gener-
ation on. . ‘

With the above in mind, it seems ironic that_those forces on the’

left who claim that the Communists candidates do ‘more harm than
good, should recommend that we withdraw and play into the hands
of the reactionaries. The truth is that Nixon would like nothing better
than for such shameful opportunism to take place in this important
election. We in the Communist Party feel that our campaign does
harm to Mr. Nixon's re-election effort and at the same time our cam-
paign tends to push a McGovern further left as opposed to the
' right. That isn’t, as many leftists claim, support for McGovern. The
reality is that it is support for the interests of the American people.

Support for the American people means winning any and all
gains possible. It means thedefeating of the reactionaries and the
election of progressives, black“ brown, women and working class can-

didates to public office. For Communists it further means a new-

stage in the struggle for a fuller broader based democracy. It means
a turning of the times in favor of the people and not the monopolies.
For these reasons and many more the Nixon Mis-administration did
all in its power to stop the Communist campaign. We faced numer-
ous. court battles because of/old anti-Communist laws which were
blocking our participation in the elections and other minority par-
ties as well. In this state we collected 40,500 signatures from the peo-
ple of this state to secure our place on the ballot. This again indi-
cates that the people want a more full democracy. In fact, the Com-
munist Party is on the ballot in 14 states.

We call for socialism, the/‘system in which the workers con-
trol the wealth they produce. The svstem that ends exploitation of
man by man, but as you know, socialism is not on the agenda of the
1972 elections. Therefore we call on the American people to voice‘
loud and clear their disatist'action,! their love for peace and their

need for change—thus we urge you to vote -Communist——pull levers

Undergraduate Review Reviewed

(Continued from Page 4)

Teaching. This survey consists
of fifteen questions. Some are
redundant, some are vague,
many are unnecessary. Ques-
tions No. 1 and No. 4 respective-
ly ask the student to rate the
professor's ability to increase
student interest and to stimulate
student thinking. A professor
who does either, does both.

Question No. 3 asks about the
teacher’s “ability to inspire
class confidence in his/her know-
ledge of the subject.” A low
rating in this area may be caus-
ed by poor course structure, in-
sufficient daily preparation, or
a simple lack of knowledge
about the subject. The ques-
tion is so vague that we cannot
determine which.

Questions 9-13 ask about the
relative effectiveness of lec-
tures, discussions, readings, as-
signments, labs and recitations
in all courses including that of
Inst Timmons (Remember Inst
Timmons?)

Question No. 7, which asks for
a rating of the teacher’s over-
all effectiveness, seems to be
the most important. The anony-
mous (name omitted by printing
error) author of the pompous-
ly titled “Report to the Faculty
and Students from the Cen-
ter for the Improvement of Teach-
ing” goes on at great length to
explain how the Center arrived
at the basis for this rating. After
long research they finally con-
cluded that students wanted "1)
to understand and (2) to be excit-
ed by learning,” and that stu-
dents judged their teachers on
that basis. Now who ever said
that you do not learn something
new every day?

Armed with that newer than
new insight, they constructed the
necessary “clusters,” “norms,”
and “deciles” which would
measure performance scientific-
ally. After six pages of this gar-
bage, J. R. Townsend answers

‘ ers S0

"What Does it Mean?” in one.
Despite the plethora of statistics,
all that can be said is that a
teacher is Superior, Inferior,
or Average.

The only remaining question
is, “Why is The Undergraduate
Academic Review such an
abomination?” The book sup-
plies a partial answer in a leng-
thy section on the tenure contro-
versy. For the most part the
three student authors merely
thrash the issue to death before
concluding (could you have gues-
sed it?), “It is definitely an issue
that should be further studied.”

Aggie Briggs, however, dis-

closes an appalling fact when"

she explains why the UAR cov-
few professors and
courses. “Professors now have
the privilege of declining the
evaluation and can prohibit
the publishing of a UAR-con-
ducted evaluation if whe/he so
decides.” The book does not
say just who granted this shock-
ing “privilege” to the faculty,
but I suggest that either the
Provost or the Chancellor im-
mediately revoke this unconscion-
able right of summary censor-
ship.

Ms. Briggs also suggests a
change.‘She recommends that stu-
dent evaluation of all professors
and courses be made manda-
tory. So far so good. However,
she says, “To meet such a man-
datory evaluation requirement,
each department can either ac-
cept a university-approved evalu-
ation form, or can devise and con-
duct its own evaluation.” Yes,
and General Motors can set emis-

sion standards and the super—.

markets can inspect their own
meat. Ms. Briggs seems to have

lost sight of “student” evaluations.

If the faculty now has the power
of prior restraint, can you ima-
gine how those departmental
evaluations would read? Would
you want to fill out a “univer-
sity-approved evaluation form”
and the accompanying 16 car-
_bons?

No, student evaluations should
remain in the hands of the stu-
dents. Faculty members can-co-
operate by requesting their de-
partment chairman to follow the
lead of Dr. Gerald Massey,
Chairman of the Philosophy De-
partment. He proposed and the
members of the Philosophy De-
partment consented to manda-
tory student evaluations of all
undergraduate Philosophy Cours-
es. Once those results have been
tabulated and rendered in simple

English, departments should keep ~

them in mind when making de-
cisions on tenure. Departments
which continually ignore student
responses to teaching perform-
ance will soon find their classes
as thinly populated as Pitt
Stadium is for a DePasqua-coach-
ed Panther team. Those depart-
ments should remember that ap-
plications for admission are al-
ready declining.

The Undergraduate Academic
Review should revert to its status
as an independent student publi-
cation by severing ties with the
Center for the Improvement of
teaching. At its rate of discov-
ery, it will be several years be-
fore the Center learns that tea-
chers actually want to be suc-
cessful teachers, and eons will
pass before they can make use-
ful suggestions. The UAR should
let the Center wallow in its de-
ciles, and get on with the busi-
ness of providing the student body
and faculty with a report on
teaching performance that is
comprehensive and comprehen-
sible. If professors co-operate,
fine. If they refuse, then the
UAR should follow the example
of course evaluations at other
colleges and universities, and
obtain the necessary information
by other means, recognizing
that their first duty is to the
student body.

According to Dr. Holbert Car-
roll’s recent report on univer-
sity governance, all segments
'of Pitt’s academic community,
students, faculty, administrators,
and even the trustees, agree that

   

this University’s primary mission
is to provide a sound and solid
four year undergraduate program.
A credible course evaluation book
would be an invaluable tool in
improving the program. Here’s
hoping for such a publication
here at Pitt. The present volume
is an insult to us all.

,tProminent Artists to
if Appear in Duke Concert

by BARBARA GERAUD

Brewer and Shipley, Buddah recording artists, will be appearing
at Duquesne University for one show on Wednesday.

The duo have been together four years. Before that, they each pla_v-

" ed various gigs around the country as singles. Their combined show

business careers total more than 20 years.
Their music reflects the many locales in which they have performed.

Mike Brewer, a Sooner from Oklahoma City, bumped around the cof-
feehouse circuit for a while before becoming a contract writer for Good

_ Sam Music, an affiliate of A&M Records.

'I‘om Shipley wanted to be a cowboy, but college and the hootenan-
nies craze got him steered into the music business.
H Shiple_y arrived in Los Angeles in 1968 and ran into Brewer. “I al-
ready had a publishing arrangement with Good Sam,” Mike says, “but
Tom didn’t, so he linked with me in my deal and after writing together

i for a year we decided to form a total duo and perform our own material.

Eventually L.A. got to them in a bad way. Mike remembers more:
“It was really a drag, andit was really foreign to us to have to face it
like a job, you know, just cranking out songs. We started to feel like a

if jukebox. And there wasn’t anything personal happening with anyone.
,..;. .:It wasn’t fun. It wasn’t making sense. And it has to be fun. So . . .

I we
split.”
'I'hey’re now settled with their families on a small farm in Mis-

souri. “People like Jesse James and Quantrell used to hide out around

here,” says Mike, adding, “We can keep in touch with the cities while
we’re on tour; that way we don’t have to live in them.”

Oncethey got themselves together, their first album, Weeds, came

’ out. The album sold moderately well and it gave an impetus to the duo.
, A promotion campaign was launched. ‘

7 By the time their second album, Tarkio, was released, they were
‘becoming firmly established. “One 'I‘oke Over the Line,” was pulled
» from the album and hit the top 10. Their third album, Shake Off the De-
’ mon, also went high on the charts.

' The concert promises to be a fun evening. Tickets are $3 for non-

, 1 Duquesneers and can be purchased at the gate.

Samurai Otters Culinary Spectacle

It has been recorded that the

warriors. In response to this tra-

While one can hardly help but

Japanese beer.

Presentation of the menu

this gourmand. A quick count
showed that there were only five

Warrior Dinner including an extra
large steak at an extra large price
was included in the list of entrees.

Orders having been taken, we
all sat back in preparation for the
performance at our table. Our
chef appeared and provided the
overture a flambe, the Teppayaki
shrimp appetizer which was re-
rriarkably delicious.

A brief intermission was called
as we consumed the onion soup
and salad which furnished the low
point of the entire meal.. The soup
was of “instant” caliber and was
filled with "seemingly dehydrated
mushrooms and onions. Asfor the
"secret Oriental dressing” of the
salad, I have tasted better bottled
dressings on many occasions.

Entree time brought a number
of interesting cutting and chop-
ping techniques by our perform-
ing chef as he.readied our respec-
tive selections. My sukiyaki strip
steak was tender, delectable, and
beautifully trimmed into bite size
pieces. The Teppanyaki sirloin
strip which my dinner companion
ordered was also artfully done but
was served apres moi, a practice
which can hardly be condoned at
any time (It is taken for granted
that diners at the same table will
be served simultaneously).

Balancing out the meal vegeta-
bly was a selection of rice and
bean sprouts. Since Oriental cook-

ing does not have a dessert course
per se, desserts at the Samurai
have been kept relatively simple.
One may have ice cream or sher-

bet topped with mandarin oranges‘

or a selection of melon. A deli-
cately scented green tea provided
the finishing touch to the meal.

Service is friendly and cordial
at the Samurai. One must ask for

some of the more common table ‘

ammenities such as water and the
serving traditionsare a bit unus-
ual by Western standards (we
were served our rice before the’
meat portion of the entree and our
bean sprouts after it); nonethe-
less, the restaurant's attempt to
recreate a sense of Oriental gra-
ciousness is’ quite successful.

Unfortunately, the Samurai is not
authentically Japanese “through
and through.” Rather than provid-
ing traditional Japanese cuisine,
it provides its Nipponese-Ameri-
can counterpart. Steak sauce, on-
ion soup, and other items reduce
the Oriental impact of the meal
and leave one with the feeling that
he has experienced a melting pot
escapade instead of an authentic
cuisine. - ‘ i

The Samurai is located at 2100
Greentree Road and is open for din-
ner from 5:30 p.m. on weekdays
and 4:30 p.m. on Sundays. The av-

erage prix fixe meal is approxi-

mately $8.50.

Rock and Roll ComesHome

by STEVEVLUBETSKY

As brilliant a musician and per-
former that he is, Edgar Winter
must have wondered when, if
ever, he would receive top billing
in Pittsburgh.

During a 10 month span, dating
from last December. the vibrant
Albino made three appearances
in the area, each time playing sec-
ond slot to such giants as Yes.
Traffic, and 'I'en Years After.

A The honor was finally bestowed
at Friday night’s Homecoming
concert at the Syria Mosque, and
Winter proved every inch worthy
of it. E

Wrapped in a kaleidescopic
black-orange cloak, Edgar Winter
proceeded on stage and shouted
his famous battle cry. "Does
everybody wanna rock ‘n’ roll?”

Armed with a mini-celeste

strapped around his shoulders,
Winter displayed his keyboard

virtuosity on rockers such as

“Keep Playing That Rock and
Roll” and “Let’s Get It On.”

Although his back-up group,
consisting of a guitarist, a bass-

?<..ist, and a drummer, was suffi-

\

cient, Winter impressed his fans
as being capable of leading a one-

man-band, as be integrated his
skills as a multi-instrumentalist
into his act. Playing percussion
in a duet with his drummer, he
proved himself equal if not super-
ior to his employee. Resorting to
his moog synthesizer, Winter ap-
plied his knowledge of electronic
music as his drummer accom-
panied him.

Winter performed an extended
saxophone solo on "Tobacco
Road.” which, as in all of his con-
certs, was the evening’s highlight.
Demonstrating a vocal range of
octaves reaching maybe 20
miles high, Winter exchanged vo-
cal intonations for instrumental
response riffs from his guitarist.

Edgar Winter and company
were going to terminate with
in New Orleans” and
"Long 'I‘all Sally,” but audience
members were so activated that
an encore was required to pro-
duce a gradient and calm the f-low
of adrenalin.

Winter, having been such a dif-
ficult act to follow the times he
appeared here previously, never-
theless discovered what it means
to have competition, as only a
hair’s difference existed between
him and second-billed Malo in per-
forming dynamics.

Without a program, the naive

observer may have conceivably
mistaken them for Santana, con-

. sidering the resemblance in mu-

sical style. The error would have
been justified, however, as there
are two Santana’s—one named
Carlos, who calls his band by his
name, and his younger brother,
Jorge, whose group Malo enthral-
led over 3,000 Pitt students Fri-
day evening.

.group’s first album,

As a guitarist. Jorge is slightly
more technical and refined stylis-
tically than his brother. and un-
like Carlos, is rather covert; as
his energies_are devoted primari-
ly to his instrument, which he
handles superbly.

Malo as a whole, however, is as
exciting and colorful as any mu-
sical "unit. The heart of the group’s
identity seems to derive from
lead vocalist Arcelio Garcia, Jr.,
who, with his hip shaking and mi-
crophone grasping, is reminis-
cent of a Latin American Joe
Cocker.

Backed by a drummer, two per-
cussionists. ,a horn section. a
bassist, an organist. and. of
course, Jorge Santana on guitar.
Garcia sang songs from the
including
their hit, “Suavecito,” and also
selections from their new effort,
Dose. -

Highlighting Malo’s perform-
ance was their finale which fea-
tured a lively improvised duet
between the twopercussionists. It
was clear from the audience’s re-
action that most people felt they
should have played all night.

Preceding Malo was the sur-
prise of the evening, Grin, a rela-

tively unknown group from Wash- ‘

ington, D. C. Piloted by Nils Lof-
grin, who plays guitar and piano,
the group got the program off to a
rollicking start as they offered
their fresh approach to rock and
roll.

What has been a relatively quiet
campus, music-wise, during the
first two months of the year came
to life at the Homecoming con-
cert, thanks to Edgar Winter.

Independent Filmmakers
  Present; ‘Mixed Bag’

by JIM RETHI

I can’t cop out completely as a critic and say that I didn‘t even
know what to expect. Actually, I have seen the work of independent
filmmakers before——last year—I caught three films that were showing
at a coffeehouse where I just happened to be. Nevertheless, when I
seated myself in Benedum Hall auditorium last Monday night, amid
people casually talking about the technical aspects of cinematography.
I do not think I was too far off in mentally coloring myself green.

I was there to view a group of films by independent West Coast

filmmakers, presented as one part of Franklin ‘Pangborn Club’s series

on independent filmmakers in general.

Punctually at 8 p.m. the lights went out, the whir of the distant pro-
,jector was heard momentarily, and a bright blue orb began throbbing
on the screen to the guttural tones of electronic music. I glanced down
at my program and saw that the first film was Loops. Before long, a top
view of the earth, including latitude and longitude lines—the kind al-
ways fround in junior high geographies—was flashing on and off, super-
imposed on the orb._ -

The music became louder, more intense, colors—brilliant shades
of green and pastel reds-—strobed and changed in striking, unsuspected
ways. and occasionally there were cuts to the mushroom of a nuclear
explosion. In five minutes, the bombardmentrof color and sound was
over, but for those five minutes, I was kept alert, even in suspense, by
what was essentially the same picture.

The next film, Epiphany, appeared immediatedly with a gritty A

black and white shot of an obese old man coming home, carryingan
armful of books. This strange character doesn’t speak to his wife at
the door, but goes directly to his desk and opening his books, began
working again. Later, apparently frustrated, he enters a room where a
lone candle burns on a small table and sits before it. After much con-
templation. he attempts to blow it out. But what? He disappears in-
stead!

The photography in this film was outstanding. The camera showed

“Cuckoo's Nest’ Dis

by JOHN METCALFE

The first purpose of a review is
to provide a clear and presum-
ably trustworthy opinion, so I’ll

' do that first. The Pittsburgh Poor

Players’ current production of
One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest is the best bit of entertain-
ment to come this way in a long
time.

Seats are on a first-come basis,
so come early. When all the pews
were filled last Saturday, there
was just enough room on the floor
to hold the late-comers.

The next purpose of a review is
to explain, and if possible justify
the opinion. Here goes.

The reason fortunate early pa-
trons of the arts were in pews is
that the University and City Min-
istry building, across Fifth from
the Cathedral of Learning, began
its career as a church.

It makes an interesting theater,

. with a space as high as it is wide

and -all the lighting exposed to
view. There is no curtain." This
leads to a few technical problems,
of which more later, but general-
ly makes for lively theater.
Breaks between scenes are more
gradual, and we are remined that
it is theater, and that it is work to
set a new scene.

_Without a curtain, scenes are

set mostly with lighting, and it is
donemasterfully. The timing is
impeccable. The first time day
came to the ward, in a burst of
fluorescent light, I was nearly
blinded with light and surprise; I
never quite got used to it, but the
transformation was certainly ef-
fective.

The ward, of course, is in a
mental hospital, where Randall
Patrick McMurphy gets himself
committed as an alternative to
remaining in jail. He appears to
be the hero of the play.

One Flew Over ‘the Cuckoo’s
Nest was originally a novel by
Ken Kesey, and a good one, and it
has survived translation to the
stage neatly. But, the first act
runs almost an hour and a quar-
ter, much too long. It is mostly
exposition, and the introduction

of characters who are already.

there to be examined. A forgiv-
able fault.

The second act is chock full of
revelations and action, much
shorter,- and paced as fast as a
Mozart rondo. The third is nearly
as quick, and builds to a satisfac-
torly climax, after a few false
endings, and relaxes into a short
coda of sorts. All excellently
paced and well made, with the
first act quibble excepted.

perfectly. At first he seems too
slight and not quite swaggering
enough to be the McMurphy des-
cribed by the other characters,
but his presence takes over. At
about the" same time that he be-
comes a persuasive force to the
inmates of "the ward he reaches
his full stature, and is very real
Mac indeed.

Throughout the action he plays
against the Big Nurse, Miss
Ratched, ably done by Pat Cohen.
She is starched, severe, humor-
less, and crosses the stage twice
as loud as anyone else can man-
age. She is the Enemy, and looks
it. Unfortunately, she sometimes
smiles while replying to a clever
sally of McMurphy’s with her sour
dialog. She bobbles an occasional
line, but carries the spirit of Big

-Nurse marvellously.

Ralph Rudolph, as Dr. Spivey,
is even more ineffectual than the
part seems to require, but he
manages.

The Aides, done by Matt Nei-
burger and Randy Nagy, some-
times looks more stupid than ne-
cessary, as if they had a private
joke going. Late in the play their
colleague, Aide Turkle (David
Crawford) does a noticably better
job. ' V

All the inmates are well played.

The best of them are Dale Hard- -

ing (Dean Hyland) and Billy Bib-
bit (Norman Rene). Bibbit gets
special attention from Big Nurse,
and responds admirably. His stut-

I ter comes and goes at just the ap-

propriate moments.

Harding, as head of the In-
mates’ Association minces effec-
tively through the play, snide and
clever. In McMurphy’s absence,
his rough-tough adoption of the
missing hero’s habits and speech
is stunning.

- Now for the real hero and the

plays Poor Players

problem with Kesey’s book and
the play. Breaks in the action are
signaled by—and the play is open-
ed with—a monolog by Chief
Broom, otherwise Chief Bromden.
He is perfectly expressed by Dan
Werntz.

In his monologs the Chief speaks
to his father, mourning the loss of
his free life and the fact that the
Combine was wiring everyone for
control and leaving nothing inside,
only rust.

In the action of the play he is
transformed from a biddable deaf
mute, satisfied to run a push-
broom all day to a dangerous psy-
chopath, and finally to a person

who could somehow make it on the '

outside. All the work and drama
in the Cuckoo’s Nest belongs to
McMurphy, but what change and
triumph there is in the Chief.
Christie Gesler was peppy and

clever as Nurse Snodgrass, but
nervous. Candy Starr was a bit

Merits

overdone by Katie Wise.

There was a bit of inadvertent
comedy as a result of having no
curtain. When darkness falls af-
ter a powerful speech it is annoy-
ing to see the shadowy character
pick up his chair and haul it to the
proper location for the next scene.

I won’t spoil any more of the
plot by mentioning it.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest is probably the most fun you
can have in public. It will be pre-
sented Friday, Saturday, and Sun-
day nights, Nov. 9, 10, and 11, and
16, 17, and 18, at 8:30 in the eve-
ning.

One last thought. In one sense
the play is as sad as a presiden-
tial term in office. If it were ter-
rible, it would play out its appoint-

.ed dates anyway. But, good as it

is, it will live its three weeks and
be gone forever.

See it while it lasts.

i 

The longest of the nine films shown was 13 minutes, and the entire
77 minutes of the show was more entertaining,’ and certainly more I
meaningful, than the last 77 hours of television I’ve watched.

Another inescapable discovery I made—-and this is largely where
the artistic value of these films rest—is that our sense of sight delights
in the novel, the unexpected, the indefinable. It is made to work again,
to pit the bizarre visions of an entranced man in Saint Flourhy, the
ever-changing animated drawings in Pulse,

What results is a revitalization of our ability to accommodate and
deal with new visual stimuli——elusive shapes that hint of the familiar, .
odd color combinations, wierd transformations—an ability that is dead-
ened and dulled by day-to-day living. ‘

West Coast—I guess all of us who haven’t been there have a kind
of naive, mysterious awe for whatever it_ is. But I think I may have
found the answer to one small question: ever wonder where all that
talent that’s missing in TV and Hollywood movies is going. '

A Hat Trick

With the-football season nearing the end. basketball is
slowly beginning to grab some of the sports headlines. And,
one of the highlights of the Pitt basketball season—-the Steel
Bowl——is just a month away.

‘ It was-recently announced that the Pitt Panthers would

play the Duquesne Dukes in_ the second game of this year’s
Steel Bowl. .

The pairings did not come easily, however. It was re-
¥‘ealed that the Dukes did not wish to meet the Cats the
irst night of the December 8-9 tourney.

-. Duquesne coach Red Manning did not want to rish hav-

ing his team lose to Pitt on such an early date. Pitt, on the
other hand, did not want to meet any other team ex-
cept the Dukes. \ ‘

“This way we guaranteedthe home town attraction and
also made sure that one of the Pittsburgh teams will make it
to the finals,” said Dean Billick. Pitt's Sports Information
Director. »

The whole "matter was resolved after the third meeting
of the opposing forces. The pairings were chosen out of a hat
by Post-Gazette Sports Editor Al Abrams.

Four hundred and sixty-five Steel Bowl tickets will go on
sale for that game on November ninth at the Student Union
ticket office. It would be advisable to get your tickets early.
Student tickets will sell sor $1.50 each. ‘

the same results, with the Mounties taking three of
those four contests.

The Mounties literally gave away the ball to the
booters several --times in the first halv and were
able to keep the ball out of their nets. West Vir-
ginia was called for 16 fouls inthe first frame and
lost the ball twice for commiting illegal throw-ins.

Pitt couldn’t capitalize although they had their
share of chances as the play becamefrantic at
both ends of the field. Play wound up at the mid-
point of the first half at Pitt’s advantage.

West Virginia got on the scoreboard, however,
with a goal at the 39:30 mark of the initial frame.
Manny Matos fired. a weak shot that barely drib-
bled out of the reach of goaltender Bill Haines,
who was completely screened on the play by two
Pitt fullbacks. I ‘

The second half was a complete turnaround of
the first, however, as the Mounties took con-

trol from the opening "kick. West Virginia turned‘

into a solid ballclub led by an excellent defense.
Joe Ohatku, the middle fullback for the Mount-

game. Ohatku was a third team all-Americanchoice
last season. ‘ ‘ ‘

' The Pitt defense was not as solid as invpi'e-
vious games but still played tough through the

second half. Fullback-‘Fernando Carriquiry and‘ if
Haines came up with several good saves. Haines 

robbed the Mountie forwards of opportunities on_
four straight chances on a single cornerkick.

The West Virginia defense was able to contain
Pitt throughout the second part of the final frame,"
keeping the play on the wings most of the time.
The booters did get a few chances on open shots‘
but were not able to find the range. '

The loss now brings Pitt’s record to 5-4-1 with

two more games to play. This coming weekend the
booters will entertain Indiana (Pa.) in a West '

Penn Conference contest but a positive date will

not be announced until tomorrow. ‘Presently sched- .« _ 
uled for Saturday afternoon, the game may conflict ‘

with the local high school playoffs. which are also
to‘ be held at Pitt Stadium.

If the Booters can pull a victory over Indiana,

they would clinch the West Penn title for the_'th'ird‘ ‘ " all

year in a row. Alliance College trails Pittonly
because they have a tie and eight wins in league
play to Pitt's perfect 4-0 record, with only Indiana
left to face in conference competition. On Novem-
ber 18 Pitt will host Penn State in the season

finale. '

Bernie Galiffa played a fantas-
tic game against Pitt on Saturday,
and was probably the single « fac-
tor that decided the outcome.

West Virginia’s total offense

_was 444 yards, and 304 of those
‘ yards came from the arm of Ga-

liffa. He completed 18 of 37 pass-

LAST Thursday the women's
varsity swim team at Pitt was
»downed by the Slippery Rock
Rockets by the score of 64-40.

,Despite the mermaids dis-
appointing Ioss to Slippery
Rock they still managed to
shatter five team records.

Marks were broken in the
200 yard medley relay with
Linda Ducsik, Anna Marie Crei-
Ii, Sue Price, and Mamie Here-
tick clocking a ‘2:06.8. Here-

’I tick broke the I00 yard indi-

es, including two for touchdowns.
Galiffa also moved into second

.place for all-time West Virginia

total offense with 3,634 yards.

He also was voted the game’s
outstanding player in the Press
Box. For most players, this would
be an exceptional performance
and would have them gloating
about all the scouts who were in
attendance.

“Oh, really, was I the outstand-
ing player?” bewildered Galiffa
replied in the locker room when
informed of the choice, “I won't
know how well I played until I see

I the game films on Monday.”

Galiffa is used to this kind of
performance, and so are his West
Virginia teamates. In the locker

eers coaches and the players who
did exceptional were thrown in
the showers fully clothed, Galiffa
was spared. Apparently, he has
been in the shower so many times
before that it’s no longer any fun
to throw him.

His modesty refuses to permit
to praise himself, but instead -he
gives credit to his receivers. “I
have a really great set of receiv-
ers,” he is quick to say. “They
make it easy for me.”

Both of the game's head coach-
es had plenty of praise for him.
“There’s no two ways about it,”
noted Pitt head coach Carl- De-
Pasqua, “Galiffa’s a great drop
back quarterback.”

His own head coach, Bobby
Bowden, put it this way: “Galiffa

real well. He is definitely an ‘All-

DePasqua also compared Galif-
fa to Florida States outstanding
signal caller Gary Huff, but was
quick to add, “Galiffa has better
receivers.”

Galiffa is a native of Donora,
Pa., which is very close to Pitts-
burgh. But outside of this, he had
no extra incentive to win.

He never played against Pitt
quarterback John Hogan, and he
was on the sidelines waiting to go
inwhen the tide turned and Pitt
pulled off the come—from-behind-
victory of all time two years ago.

ing, but Pitt was thwarted in its
efforts to repeat that perform-
ance this year.

Galiffa threw two touchdown
passes in the game, one of which
was questionable, as many ob-
servers felt that his receiver,
Nate Stephans, never had posses-
sion of a Galiffa pass which he
lost as he crossed the goal-line.

He teamed up again with Steph-
ans in the second quarter, this one
for a seven yard TD. Galiffa was
not perfect, however, he did

throw two interceptions (picked
off by Mike Bulino and Jim Buck-
mon) and his net rushing yard-
age was —39. He did win the game
though.

Harriers Finish
Second At Big 4

by LYNN HARRIS

The Pitt harriers tied with the West Virginia Mountaineers for sec-
ond place on Friday at the Big Four Invitational in Syracuse. N. Y.

Penn State, Pitt, West Virginia, and Syracuse all participated with
Penn State winning the meet, scoring 25 points; Pitt and WVU tying for
second, both scoring 64 points, and Syracuse coming in last with 81.

As a team Penn State took first, fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth, and
10th in the top 10 scoring positions. Penn State’s Matt Chadwick came
in first setting a new course record of 26.50.9. The previous record
was held by Bruce Fisher of Syracuse. — .

“Penn State is one of the toughest teams in the East,” commented
Coach Don Mollenhaur. .

“It’s the strongest Penn State team I’ve ‘seen since I've been at
Pitt,” he continued. —

West Virginia’s Don Sauer took second place with a time.of 26.56,
also setting a new course record. He was the only Mountaineer to place
in the top 10 scoring positions. _

“WVU’s balance and depth was not as good as it was at Morgan-
town,” commented Mollenhaur, referring to the Pitt-West Virginia
meet of October 13. I ' _

No one from Syracuse placed in the top 10. Syracuse’s top man,
Ray Morabito, took 14th place.

“Syracuse is a young, fair team,” said Mollenhaur.

Mickey Collins, Bob Steele, and Nick Martin took third, sixth, and
ninth places, respectively. Collins, with a time of 27.15, was the fourth
fastest ever to run on the Drumlin’s’Country Club Course.

I The harriers only ran. five men in the meet, Bob O’Neil went to
Syracuse but did not run at the last minute due to a sore throat.

“We did a tremendous job under the circumstances,” commented

' Mollenhaur. -

Bob Schurko was still fighting a virus and John Black had worked
out only one week of the past two due to a knee injury.

Spikers Win 2 ot3

by VICKY VETERE

The women’s varsity volleyball
team was two for three this week-

' end as they beat Chatham Thurs-

day evening and split in a tri-meet
situation with Slippery Rock and
Edinboro on Saturday afternoon. -

Both the varsity and the junior
varsity squads romped over Chat-
ham in consecutive wins. The jun-
ior varsity team won 15-12 and 15-
4 and the varsity team won 15-3,
15-9.

Team manager Eileen Surdo-
val summed up the match, “Chat-
ham is pretty inexperienced. It
was an easy victory for both my
A and M teams. But for a short
while there I started to worry. We
had the lead and began to let up.
Errors resulted from some sloppy
playing and Chatham started to
gain on us. But the girls soon s_et—
tled down and played their game.”

But Saturday’s clash with Slip-
pery Rock and Edinboro was

somewhat more challenging. Held -

at Slippery Rock, it was the
team’s first competition on the
road.

Pitt’s junior varsity team lost
to Slippery Rock, 3-15 and 5-14
(game called due to time), and to
Edinboro 12-15 and 7-15. But the
varsity squad managed to split
the bill, losing to Slippery Rock,
10-15 and 11-15, but edging out
Edinboro in three games, 5-15,
15-10, and 15-9.

“We put up a tough battle
against Slippery Rock,” com- ,
mented Surdoval. “But we had
less experience and it showed. But
the match was very spirited and
our serving proved effective.”

‘Slippery Rock was one of the
toughest hurdles on the women’s
schedule. “Their coach told me
that she had 60 girls go out for the
team and that they practive five
nights a week for two hours a
night. Our full roster is 13 girls
and we practice a total of four
hours a week. Considering that,
we did pretty well on Saturday,”
admitted Surdoval and then add-
ed, “And besides, they had a six
foot spiker on ther team I”

Edinboro proved _a less polish-
ed opponent. “They had some
problems serving so we picked up
points there,” said Surdoval.

Pitt’s men’s volleyball club ac-
companied the women to Slippery

‘Rock and played against the Slip-

pery Rock men’s squad just as a
practice session. The the men and
women joined forces and had
some friendly co-_ed competition.

The women’s varsity team rec- *
ord is now three and one and they
will put it on the line against CMU

in a home match on Thursday,

Nov. 16, at 4:30 p.m. “We could
use a little more fan support,”
urged Surdoval.
