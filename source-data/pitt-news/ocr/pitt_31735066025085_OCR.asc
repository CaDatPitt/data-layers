Center of the storm

O’Connor defends decisions and reflects on

By Gary Knapick

Senior Staff Writer

Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor, who will be
installed as chancellor of the university tomorrow, said
that maintaining Pitt’s capacity to attract the best
scholars and to educate the brightest students was one
of the greatest challenges facing the institution. '

O’Connor described his ﬁrst seven months at Pitt as
“wonderfully interesting and informative” and discussed
a few of the events and decisions that highlight his early
presidency.

“I think that we have attempted  to change the
operating culture of this institution. I would like to think
that we have been as successful as one could hope to

’ be in seven months,” O’Connor said.

“We have managed to make some substantial hires
after a‘ lot of search activity on the part of the faculty and
staff. We have managed to put in place a rather
substantial bond issue, which will give uslthe capacity
to renovate some badly ‘needed laboratories and
classrooms and computer labs. We have put together a

process which, over time, is going to be seen as a»

benchmark, if you will, for faculty involvement in the
budget process,” O’Connor said.

installation ceremony, which will be funded through
alumni donations, will cost an additional $92,550.

O’Connor said the university spends $720 million
annually and manages another $1.5 billion. “You’re
saying $500,000 out of two billion?” O’Connor said.

O’Connor offered support to his decision to tentatively
allow ROTC to remain on campus in spite of the
Department of Defense regulations that ban
homosexuals from military service.

“Right now, under current circumstances, it is my
conclusion that standing up and making [the expulsion
of ROTC] a part of University of Pittsburgh policy would
not resolve the issue of discrimination in the ROTC.
Consequently, I chose not to make that decision now.
That is not to say that in 1995 that might be a great
decision to make,” O’Connor said.

“Coupled with that decision was a‘ decision to work
with a substantial number of other  institutions to
convince the Department of Defense that their policy
is unwise.

“I’ve taken action. I haven’t taken the action that was

’‘ ‘I recommended by the [University Senate]. To take that

action doesn't resolve the question. Furthermore, it
puts in jeopardy the careers of many young men and

Fewstudents involved in natural sciences

By Heatller York ‘
suqr Writer »

The 19903 offer outstanding
opportunities in the natural
sciences, but few undergraduate
students are entering the field,
Edward —Str'icker, professor and
chair of Pitt’s department of
behavioral neuroscience and

bioscience, said at an
interdisciplinary discussion held
yesterday. .

Stricker moderated the

discussion, which was part of a
series of academic symposia held
in honor of Pitt President]. Dennis
O’Connor’s installation tomorrow.
Stricker called the lack of
students entering the natural
sciences an important paradox
and “something of a national
crisis.” , ,
The five panelists at yesterday’s
discussion represented various
fields within the natural sciences
and addressed the paradox. They
spoke about what the next decade
will bring in their respective ﬁelds.

The-panelists ‘were John
Cooper, professor and chair of
Pitt’s department of chemistry;
Robert Glaser, professorand co-
director of Pitt’s Learning Research
and Development Center; James
Maher, professor and chair of
Pitt’s physics department; Robert
Moore, professor of psychiatry
and director of Pitt’s center for
neuroscienceygand Larry J.
Shuman, associate dean of Pitt’s
School of Engineering.

’ Cooper illustrated successes in

chemistry by showing a cover of

Science magazine which named

the Buckminster Ful1erene_

molecule, a recently discovered
form of carbon, “Molecule of the
Year.”

“I am continually astounded by
the ability of this subject to
reinvent itself, ”' Cooper said.

The challenges of the next
decade, Cooper said, lie in
changing the perceptions of
chemistry, creating new roles for
chemists and solving problems
created in the past. Also important,

he said, are generational changes,
scale and diversity.

Cooper said it will be important
to train a generation of chemists
who can solve the problems
created by earlier chemists, like
chloroflourocarbons, which -are
depleting the ozone layer.

“We need to train chemists
who will create roles in the city,
helping people, not assuming
they will go to Exxon or DuPont,”
he said.

Robert Glaser spoke about
recent research in behavioral
sciences, ‘but he said the
boundaries between all sciences
were breaking down.

“In the past there were four
areas of scientific study: the small,
the large, life and the mind,” he
said. “Now the boundaries are
breaking down, and in the next
10 years many more scientific
walls will be smashed.”

Glaser said research in the
behavioral sciences has great
potential, and the next 10 years

Student Government Board opposes ROTC stance

By Christine Hanna

News Assistant

In an effort to show Pitt President J.
Dennis O’Connor their disapproval of his
recent decision to retain the ROTC on
campus despite the Department of
Defense’s policy that discriminates against
bisexuals, gays and lesbians, the Student
Government board released the following
statement at their meeting yesterday:

”The Student Government Board at the
University of Pittsburgh /i nds the presence

of the Reserve /Ojficers’/ Training Corps
(ROTC) in conflict with the institutions
non-discrimination policy. This policy
states: ’7he University of Pittsburgh, as an
educational institution and as an
employer, does not discriminate on the
basis of race, color, religion, ethnicity,
national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation
ormarital, veteran orhandicapped status.
This is a commitment made by the
university, and is in accordance with

federal, state and local laws and
regulations. ’

The Department of Defense (DoD)
directive 1332.14 states, Homosexuality
is incompatible with military service  ’
ROTC adheres to and follows DoD
regulations and does not allow persons of
a homosexual or bisexual orientation to
participate within its programs. This form
of discrimination condoned by the
university is deplorable.

Not only is a video phone a
reality in today’s society, but it is
here at Pitt. This Friday it will be
usedto broadcast the installation
of Pitt President J. l)ennis
O'Connor to all of the branch
campuses."

The system is called Picturetel,
and it can be used for interactive
video conferences between any
of the live Pitt campuses: Oakland,
Greensburg, T itusville, Bradford
and Johnstown.

“We're already using it for
instruction," said Dr. J. Fred Gage,
the director of the University
Center for Instructional
Resources.

Right now the system is being
used for classes between the
Oakland campus and
Greensburg,

In the fall it will begin to service
the other campuses as well.

‘‘It took the lPersianl Gulf war
to really make this technology

companies needed a way to
interact with branch offices in
different countries, since
travelling was not always
convenient. Video conferences
were the answer.

“It certainly will mean that we
will be able to strengthen a
number of programs at all of the
campuses," Gage said.

“A single class can be taught at
one location and be seen at
different campuses at the same
time,” said Kerry Harrity, an
electronics specialist at UCIR.

“The class can originate at any
location and be transmitted to
any or all locations," I-Iarrity
said.

Pictu retel works by transmitting
a video image over phone lines.
The image is transformed in the
same way that phones change
voices.

While the system costs about
$30,000 per campus to purchase
and install, the cost to run it is

Those are the same lines
used for phone and
computer-data transmission right
now.

The money to purchase the
system was taken from a special
bond issue set up for that purpose
five years ago.

The system will be useful for
administrative purposes as well.
Gage said the cost of transporting
administrative personnel from the
branch campuses to the main
campus for a meeting can total as
much as $450.

Picturetel would save both
time and money in these
instances.

For video conferences involving
three or more parties, the system
has voice-activated video.
Anytime one person speaks, all
of the locations receive that
transmission.

For situations involving only
two locations, there is a two-way,
continuous link.

teacher would be able to hear
the students on the other
campus at all times and vice
versa.

For O’Connor’s installation,
cameras will be set up at Carnegie
Music Hall, and the picture will
be sent through the phone lines
to a “bridge” in Atlanta. From
there the signal can be
strengthened and sent to the
branch campuses.

Viewing locations on this
campus include Forbes Quad
Room 1M56, Cathedral of
Learning Room 332 and the
conference room at UCIR in
Hillman Library.

Gage said he would like to
see this system expand to include
hospitals and secondary
schools across Western
Pennsylvania. A

“This system gives us the
opportunity to«bring in anyone in
the world through video,” he
said.

 NYC journalist to speak

By Heather York
Sta_[fW'riter
p Mark Singer, writer for The New Yorker magazine, will read
BY Christine Hanna from his work and lecture at the University of Pittsburgh next
News Assistant

Wednesday in Room 501 of the Cathedral of Learning.

Singer, who described himself as a wide—eyed, 24-year-old
when he showed up in New York City, said he got his job at
The New Yorker partly because he was in the right place at the
right time. And he had the right credentials, or lack thereof.

Singer, a native of Oklahoma who majored in English at Yale
University, had never lived in NYC. Nor had he any experience
as a journalist when he applied for the job.

But he said the approach he took toward NYC and his stories
was unique enough to capture the attention of the New Yorker
editor, who hired him to do the regular feature “Talk of The
Town.” Seventeen years later, Singer is still writing the column
that gives New Yorkers a slightly juxtaposed vision of the city
they have come to endure.

In addition to his regular feature, Singer has also written
proﬁles and features for the magazine, as well as an occasional
fictional piece. ’

A serialized story he wrote for The New Yorkerbecame his
first book, Funny Money, a chronicle of the collapse of the
Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City. The book spent two
months on the bestsellers list.

His latest book, Mr. Personality, is a collection of his
reporting pieces from The New Yorker.

The Accounting Association
hopes to put Pitt back on the
map of job recruitment with its
seminar next week.

In recent years, major
companies have lost interest in
Pitt’s business and accounting
departments. They have begun
to more heavily recruit students
from Duquesne, Penn State and
West Virginia University.

AA President Jim Geary said
there will be an informal
presentation Monday night to
give big firms and companies
the chance to see what Pitt has
in these departments.

Attending will be
Bank, the IRS, FBI, Graphic Arts
Technical Foundation, Price
Waterhouse, Coopers &

Lybrand, Peat & Marwick and
Deliotte & Touche.

“We are doing this to both
establish a better representation
with the business community
and, on an educational level, for
accounting undergraduates,”
Geary said. “This is also a golden

For over 10 years Pitt’s
computer-scienoe depa Itment has
offered a Help Room to aid
students with introductory and
intermediate computer-science
courses. Its goal is to assist
students in a step-by-step analysis
of their program to detect errors
and work out the bugs.

The program was started in the
late _’70s, when computer science
began to boom as a major,
according to Dr. Daniel Doud,
chairperson of the Undergraduate
Office of Computer Science.

He said this kind of help was
necessary because many students
in these courses didn’t have
previous computer experience.

Doud said difficulties arise for
today’s students because
“[programming courses] are
unique and are totally different
than any other course.”

Doud explained that students
in the early part of a computer

course can become discouraged
and lose interest in programming
if they do not receive help.

The Help Room is specifically
designed to aid students in the
computer languages QuickBasic,
FORTRAN, COBOL, Pascal,
Modula-2, C and PC Assembly
Language.

But Doud reminded students,
“The purpose of the program is
to offer assistance to the students,
not to do [programs] for them."

John Candee, a course assistant
who works in the Help Room,
said that while the program was
initially set up for computer-
science majors, generally students
from other majors use the service.

Candee said in some cases the
Help Room takes the place of a
teaching assistant because
introductory classes sometimes
have up to 40 people and it
becomes hard to get enough
individual attention. Candee said
he takes the students through the
assignment and helps to show
them how to do it.

women who have chosen to enroll
in ROTC on this campus."

O'Connor defended his
opposition to the proposed
Cowell “right to know" Bill, which
is now working its way through
the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives.

“I am against the law as
unamended. It is bad public
policy. We have offered to work
with Representative [Ron] Cowell,
and, indeed, we are. We have
sent to him a series of
amendments that we think are
both appropriate [and] helpful,
that safeguard items that should
be legitimately safeguarded,"
O’Connor said.

O’Connor disagreed with the
argument that Pitt should not be
excepted from certain aspects of
such legislation. '

“Why should we be different
from any of the state institutions,
such as Indiana, California,

Slippery Rock, et cetera? My

response is because we are
different. We are markedly
different. We have close to two
billion dollars a year in federal
contracts and grants for research
activity. We have an endowment
close to $300 million. We have a
library holding 2.5 million

[volumes] that we need to
nurture and enhance," O’Connor
said.

“We're a very complex,
multimission institution  with
extensive graduate and
professional education,"
O’Connor said. “We can’t respond
with simple solutions to complex
missions.”

Despite present problems,
O’Connor said he is proud of the
university and its renown among
other colleges.

“The Latin American Center at
the University of North Carolina,
when it thinks about Pitt, it thinks
about stealing people from here
because we have the best Latin
American center. When people
start thinking about business
ventures led by business schools
in Eastern Europe, they think
about Pitt because we're over in
Czechoslovakia trying to assist
that nation in getting back into a
market economy.

“When you think about
chemistry and you’re sitting in
Los Angeles, you think about Pitt
because we have, unarguably,
one of the best chemistry
departments in the country. When
people think about Pitt, most of
the people who think about it
think about it and say, ‘Damn,

what a great place,’” O’Connor
said.

O’Connor’s long-range hopes
for the university are simple.

“I’d like to see it doing what it's
doing, only more of it and better
at it,” O’Connor said.

Vice President of Student Affairs
Bill I-Iarmon said, “I don’t see
how [O’Connor] could perform
any better, in light of the financial
state of the university and the

way he found it. He hit the
ground running.”
SGB member Barbara

Rodriguez said she agreed.

“He’s coming in at a rough
time, and he’s going to take some
heat,” Rodriguez said.

Harmon praised O’Connor for
“openness and his vision for the
university itself.”

“I think he brought a sense of
fair play. The lines of
communication are open,”
Harmon said.

O’Connor is handling the ROTC
situation well, according to
Harmon.

“You knew where he stood.
He was clear and concise. He
made a decision on something,
and you can’t contest that. He
made the best decision, with
regard to the best interests of the
institution,” Harmon said.

Opinions on O’Connor’s
actions concerning ROTC
vary among student-group
leaders.

“Pitt can’t change the DoD’s
policy, so students with
scholarships shouldn’t be
affected,” said Jacinta Dvorak of
the College Republicans.

Dvorak said removing ROTC
from the university because it
discriminates against
homosexuals is analogous to
getting rid of the football team
because it doesn’t allow women
to play or expelling the Campus
Women’s Organization because
it discriminates against men.

“He tried to play it safe. I just
felt like he was trying to please
everybody,” Rodriguez said. “If
we allow ROTC to
discriminate, can other groups
do it, too?”

“I think that with the
information he had, he thought
that he was making the right
decision,” said Linda Jarrett, co-
president of Pitt’s Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Alliance. “He’s
making plans to mend the

‘situation, though. The case isn’t

closed yet, ”Jarrettsaid. "We don’t
like what he decided, but we
don’t think this is his final
decision, either.”

President Erin Bush said,
“[O'Connor’s] decision advertised
that the university would accept
discrimination and that he wasn’t
going to do anything about it.
Personally, I find that
embarrassing.”

Reactions to the university’s
much-publicized expenditures on
O’Connor’s office, residence and
installation ceremony were not
as mixed.

Joel Leonard, president of

University Democrats, said, “I do
think that $92,000 is too much for
the installation of a chancellor,
but I think it is important to
celebrate this occasion as a way
to remember the past and
look forward to the future of
Pitt.” .
“Anyone who comes into the
university after the devastation
that Wesley Posvar left and makes
those kinds of expenditures, I’m
very critical of,” Dvorak said. “He
saw what a distaste Posvar left
with the students.

“In the average Pittsburgh
suburb, you can buy a house for
the amount he spent to redecorate
his office,” Dvorak said. “Two
people could have gone through
CAS for four years [with $92,550].
It just boggles my mind,” she
added.

“Inside of Pittsburgh, Pitt is
getting a bad reputation,” she
said.

Bush said she agreed with
Dvorak. “It’s like Imelda Marcos
and buying thousands of pairs of
shoes when people were starving
in the Phillipines. People are
seeing this and going, ‘Geeze,”’
Bush said.

The right to know bill is a

necessity, according to the"

organization leaders.

“Right after Posvar left there
was a hostile environment
regarding the university’s fiscal
policies and extravagant
expenditures,” Bush said.

‘O’Connor’s reluctance to accept
the bill in its present form “made
things worse because it made it
seem as though the university
had something to hide," Bush
said. “If the university has nothing
to hide, why don’t they
open their records up?" Bush

."-"\§

asked. air: ' .

“Pitt is a public institution. The
students, the faculty and the
taxpayers have a right to know
where the money is going,”
Dvorak said.

. “I think O’Connor is wrong to
oppose or want amendments to
the Cowell bill. It makes [Pitt]
look like its hiding something.
You don’t see armed guard

“outside of research buildings,”

Leonard said.
Students said they thought

O’Connor’s monthly open forums 

were valuable to opening the
channels of communication in
the university.

"People have seen him. People
know what he looks like in
person,” Rodriguez said.

“There are, in fact, 35,000 full-
and part-time students at this
university. There are close to
15,000 employees. I regret that
there are only 24 hours in the
day, but I have tried to make
myself accessible,” O’Connor
said.

total education.
The Student G'—overnmentBoard
demands a separation of ROTC
as a university-affiliated
organization. We ﬁnd the DoD
policy to be destructive to thespirit
of cooperation which must exist
at an academic institution. We
find that the University of
Pittsburgh must take immediate
action and remove the hypocrisy
behind which it currently
operates. The board adamantly
opposes President O’Connor’s
revision of the [University] Senate
Council /c]ommittee’s rec-
ommendations. Discrimination,
in any shape or form, is wrong.
Although the DoD and ROTC
discriminates on the basis of
sexual orientation, the
university’s unwillingness to talee

the appropriate measures only"

serves to provolee discrimination
on all levels. President O’Connor
has allowed the injustice of
racism, sexism and hate toward
gays, lesbians and bisexuals by
allowing ROTC to continue this
practice on our campus. The
Student Government Boa rd ﬁnds
President O’Connor and this
institution at fault for allowing
this offensive policy to indeﬁnitely
remain at the university. We
recognize the beneﬁts that the
ROTCprovidesforitsparticipants,
butas long asdirective 1332.14 is

enforced, we can not and will not ’

tolerate the blatant discrimin-

ation practiced by our university

through the ROTC program. The

time has come for a new. era of
openness and understanding at

Pitt. Let us not hinder the coming

of this new era by advocating the

institutionalized practice of
discrimination by allowing the

Reserve /Oﬂicers’] Training Corps

to remain sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh. ”

SGB President Gil Golden said
the University of Pittsburgh has a
responsibility  wto fight
discrimination;

“A university can outlive public
opinion, governments and wars
when other-institutions collapse-
under these pressures. Possibly
this is because universities have a
different mission than most other
types ofinstitutions. Inherent in a
university’s mission is the
promotion and dissemination of
knowledge, and knowledge leads
to understanding.

Understanding discrimination
leads to the realization that
discrimination is morally wrong.
I do not wish to witness the
University of Pittsburgh know-
ingly commit such a potentially
dangerous act,” Golden said.

The SGB felt the need to present
a strong statement that they opp-
ose discrimination ofevery kind,
SGB member Jacob Brody said.

“We feel that the continued
coexistence of the ROTC program
and this university presented a
contrast of policies that we felt
must be addressed. This university
cannot state that it does not
discriminate and sponsor an
organization that clearly, clearly
within it’s directives mandates
discrimination,” Brody said.

SGB. member Melissa Smith
agreed.

“This stand against discrim-

ination is important because it .

reflects the thoughts of the new
generation. The military’s discrim-
inatory policies are outdated;
people of today do not mind

serving next to gays, lesbians and «

bisexuals. As an out, bisexual
woman I was appointed to the
Student Government Board and
have not hurt the morale of the
ISGBI or the university, ” she said.

In other business, Golden
confirmed that March 19 and 20
will be reserved for undergraduate
seniors with at least 84 credits,
incl-uding transfer and current-
term registration credits, to register
for the fall term.

March 23 begins open
registration for all students,
including graduate students.

Maher, from the physics
department, said research
opportunities in his field thrill
him, and he is puzzled by the
lack of enthusiasm in the
younger generation.

Educators must find ways to

excite undergraduate students _

who “glaze over” in lectures. A
big problem, he said, is that
undergraduate students rarely
experience one—on-one
education.

“Science is expensive,” Maher
said. “Introductory courses are
taught to casts of thousands.”

initiated new techniques to
encourage promising under-

said. Students have a greater

extending the progress of
molecular studies to behavioral
problems.

“Humans are the only
animals with concepts of past,
present and future. But these
constructs are‘ no more than
brain activity," he said.

Drawing students into his
field is hard, Moore said,
because students are drawn by
not only curiosity, but by the
desire to be rewarded with
money for their work.
Educators can do little about
society, but they can enhance

curiosity, Moore said.

“The most effective teaching
is by a teacher who enjoys his
subjects and has immense
enthusiasm in it,” Moore said.

Larry Shu man, associate dean
from Pitt’s School of
Engineering, said America has
too few engineers, and he is
concerned that the problems
will worsen in the next
generation. “Engineers create
rather than redistribute the
nation’s wealth. Keeping
students in engineering is a
major concern.”

SGB’s ajﬁrmative action
Yesterday the SGB released its findings in the battle

I against discrimination committed by the Reserve Officers’

Training Corps. Adding their voice to the various student
groups and individuals, SGB’s statement on the University
of Pittsburgh's ROTC policy reflects a firm commitment to
equality and fairness.

Two weeks ago, President O’Connor accepted all but

 one finding of the University Senate Council on

discrimination by the ROTC program.

O’Connor chose not to accept the 1997 deadline for
ROTC removal for failure to comply to Pitt’s non-
discrimination code. The University Senate clearly indicated
that ROTC removal was not its goal — it chose a date to
put pressure on the Department of Defense to end its
bigotry. Pressure is mounting across the country, as many
universities set dates for ROTC termination.

Unfortunately for our community, O’Connor failed to
approve the key strategy and allowed the program to
remain.

In response, to O’Connor’s action, the SGB statement
reads in part: “As an educational institution the University
of Pittsburgh must act in a manner which fosters openness
and community. The statement by the president serves to
encourage an attitude of tolerance for acts of hate and
discrimination at the University of Pittsburgh. Hate against
women. Hate against African-Americans. Hate against
gays, lesbians and bisexuals. Hate based on religion. Hate
based on ethnic origins. This hate is detrimental to the
academic mission of this institution. President O’Connor’s
statement in support of ROTC’s presence at Pitt undermines
the atmosphere of ‘multiculturalism that this university
finds to be a critical part of the total education.”

Hate is manifested in the DoD policy of discrimination.
Men and women are expelled, given dishonorable
discharges or even jailed before expulsion if they are
determined to be gay, lesbian or bisexual by military
inquisitors. _

It is outrageous to imagine jailing a woman who
happens to be a lesbian in the military. It is outrageous to
imagine a gay man being tossed out of ROTC and losing
scholarship opportunities.

r The presence of ROTC is offensive to individuals who
are hated because of their race, sexual orientation,
religion or ethnic background. . .

The University Senate reached a compromise everyone
could live with. ROTC students would not be impacted -
most likely the DOD policy will end discrimination as
more schools‘ '§€fﬁ ve‘W"Democratic
pres_idential nominee has vowed to do away with the
policy if elected.

However O’Connor chose to abandon and further
marginalize minorities and women.

Over the years, the SGB has remained silent on many
issues impacting the university. Now with a boldness, it
grapples an important issue head-on.

President O’Connor has already decided the strategy
that he wishes the university to follow. Now action is
needed from the Student Government Board to put its
money where its mouth is and to do the right thing.

Female condom alters women’s attitudes

At the end of this month American health experts
will decide whether or not to approve the women's
condom, which has already been approved by
France and Britain and went on sale in Switzerland
earlier in the month. It has the dual purposes of a

contraceptive and an additional barrier method

against AIDS.

We can now cut up and suck out and add in all
different parts of our bodies because we don’t like
how they look. Forget that Dow Corning now
admits that silicon breast implants can leak silicone
into the body, making the implants dangerous. It’s
not the toxic time bomb inside that counts with
people like us because "we’re big—breasted. And

I am split on my opinion of this i
new product. I think it is great
that women now have an
alternative way to protect
themselves against AIDS, yet at

Allison .
Irwin

doesn’t that make‘ us feel
important’ ‘ _
The female condom was
tested on prostitutes in Thailand,
and they found it uncomfortable.

the same time technology has
taken over our rationality —— we don’t need it
anymore.

We have been spending money like wildfire
trying to find a cure for AIDS, and there is no
answer yet. The disease is still spreading among
homosexuals, heterosexuals, adults and children.

In Sunday's Pittsburgh Press it was reported that
796 people between the ages of 13 and 16 have
contracted AIDS. Another source reported that
170,000 college students have died from AIDS
already. The number infected with the HIV virus is
much larger and still unknown. '

There is still no cure for cancer or for the common
cold, and that makes me wonder. if we can cure
AIDS. Medical technology can now treat cancer
even if we can’t cure it, but it has taken so long. A
significant portion of the population will be wiped
out or infected before AIDS can even be treated.

The female condom is trying to preventAIDS, but '

it is focusing our attention in the wrong direction.
We definitely need to stop AIDS, but designing new
technologies for prevention is not foolproof.

The problem is that AIDS needs to be stopped.
People need to change their lifestyles and take
action, not try to hide behind a safety net.

In and of themselves, technological advances
such as the female condom are very useful and
necessary. But at the same time they are eliminating
our rationalityjust take a look at recent technological
developments.

Norplant is also a new contraceptive, distributed
in Pittsburgh‘ through places such as Planned
Parenthood and Magee Women's Hospital. Norplant
is a set of Five flexible tubes inserted under the skin
on the inside of a woman's upper arm. This
contraceptive works for about five years by emitting
time-released hormones.

This new technology keeps people from thinking.
Insert some tubes in a woman's arm, and she is no
longer a reproductive being — well, for five years
anyway. It’s like sticking a microchip into a robot.

We have patches to stick on our arms if we want
to quit smoking. Rely on a second chemical to stop
dependency on -the first chemical. For some
chemicals this is necessary, but for smoking it’s a
luxury. If the luxury is there, you might as well use
it,’right? But it's the memory of how hard it was to
quit that keeps you from forming the dependency
again. When you use the patch, you don’t remember.
The patch will quit for you.

Add to that the fact that the
failure rate of this device is five percent because it’s

tricky to use. But that’s OK. We can sleep around 0-
again because we have more protection against‘

AIDS.

Cut up your breasts, and add some silicone. Slice
up the nose. Suck out the hips. Take Norplant and
use the female condom, and you're ready to go out

into the world. You can decide what you want your —

body to do chemically and what you want it to look
like, and technology will provide it for you.
Technological advances perpetuate the thinking

that there are “other” people andnot an “us.” We ~

don’t have to think of contracting HIV now that we
"have the women's condom, and that makes it
someone else’s problem. But in reality it’s no longer
“other” people’s problem. It’s_ everyone’s problem
because it affects all groups—sexual and nonsexual,
adults and children. , _ _
Women had problems with insecurity, so breast

' implants were developed as a solution. Then men

started getting implants, too, in their arms, legs,
chests and what not. But it wasn’t a solution; it just
created another problem: bodies that attack
themselves because of leaking silicone. Notice the
self-esteem thing never went away.

- Technology needs to keep the focus on AIDS.
The rate of infection is now increasing the fastest
among heterosexuals. But AIDS is everyone’s
problem, sexually active people, children, drug

- users and professionals in health ﬁelds. -

An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of
cure, but we need to focus on cure. That’s where
the money needs to be spent. There is so much
money being spent there already, but obviously it’s
not enough if we don’t have a cure or a treatment.
We need to spend it on developing the technology
to stop AIDS, not on things surrounding AIDS. Not
on installation parties and trips to the Cayman
islands. Not on beer advertisements and then
multimillion-dollar lawsuits against the
advertisement for sexism (although I do think this
is worthwhile). And not on more nuclear weapons
when we can’t even dispose of the nuclear waste
we have now, beside the fact that we passed
mutually assured destruction years ago.

The money needs to be spent on one of the
biggest threats to society today, one that’s spreading
faster than we can watch it. AIDS.

By Rob Pugliese

Senior Sports‘Wr'lter

The Pitt wrestling team closed out its
dual-meet season with a 19-16 loss at Kent
State Tuesday night.

Panther head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said his team was not completely into
wrestling this meet from a mental
standpoint, but it was looking ahead to the
Eastern Wrestling League Championships
on March 6 and 7.

“It was a frustrating night, but it’s behind
us now,” Stottlemyer said.

If the Panthers could have won just one
of the first six bouts, the victory would
have been theirs.

Neither junior Bobby Simpson (126
pounds) or first-year wrestlerJ.J. Fasnacht
(134) could produce the points Pitt needed
from the lower weights. Simpson will
wrestle at the 118-pound weight class for
EWLs, and this should benefit him greatly.
Stottlemyer said he was disappointed that
Fasnacht let a golden opportunity slip
away.

“He had a chance to win, and he just
didn’t grab hold of it and do it,” Stottlemyer
said. “He had an_ opportunity to win it in
the last 30 seconds, and that’s when most
good matches are won."

Junior Steve Budman (14-8-2) did not
wrestle because of a bruised knee. His
absence hindered Pitt’s chances. Budman
could have picked up crucial points at the
142- pound weight class. Sophomore Mike

timizes Lady Panthers, 90-47

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

The Pitt women’s basketball
team hoped its game against the
Connecticut Huskies would break
its recent losing skid and build
what little momentum it could
heading into the Big East
tournament. The final result only
made things worse — 90-47
worse.

The Huskies, now 19-9 overall,
12-5 in the Big East conference,
gained the opening tap, scored
the first bucket of the game and
never looked behind them. The
Panthers fall to 9-17 overall and
8-12 in conference action.

Meghan Pattyson led her team
in scoring with 17, including
seven—out-of-10 shooting from the
floor and three out of four free
throws. Thirteen of her points
came in the first half, when
Connecticut effectively put the
game out of reach. Pattyson
collected five rebounds.

Connecticut rookie Rebecca
Lobo victimized the hapless Pitt
squad for 15 points, 11 of those
coming in the first period of play.
She also snagged five boards.

The Panthers had their
difficulties controlling the
Huskies. Trying to foul to stop
them from scoring failed.
Connecticut worked a successful
strategy of driving the ball at the
frontcourt players, trying to make
them commit a foul or give up an
easy basket.‘

The shooting-percentage
statistic played a big role for both
teams. Connecticut shot 60.7
percent in the first half and 62.5

erwise dim game for Pitt.

with less than a minute remaining before
losing a decision.

Stottlemyer said if this match had been
vital, Budman could have wrestled, but
there was no sense in risking his status for
EWLS.

Instead Pitt fell behind 19-0 before
winning the final four bouts of the meet.
At the 167-pound class, Scott Hovan raised
his record to 25-3 with a pin.

Sean Gibbs continued to roll, notching
his 23rd win against only five defeats.
Sophomore Jeff Kloiber (190) has shown
signs of consistency the last few weeks,
and he came up with a 5-2 decision over
Kent’s Chris Albert. Kloiber, now 13-7-3
for the year, said Pitt should have won the
match, but is only thinking about
tournament time now.

“We didn’t wrestle well, but Budman
wasn’t in the lineup, and if he’d have been
in there we probably would have won the
match. Budman was a key,” Kloiber said.
“Maybe a couple of the guys were just
looking forward to EWLs."

Heavyweight Perry Miller scored a major
decision to conclude a stellar, 23-1 regular
season. Stottlemyer praised his four
stalwarts, who have combined for an 84-
16-3 mark.

“We didn't get started until 167, and we
blew them away after that," Stottlemyer
said. “Those four guys wrestle tougher
than shoe leather.”

Stottlemyer said he is not overly
concerne about losing this bout with

 

percent in the second for a 61.5

percentage for the game. The
Lady Panthers, on the other hand,
shot an abysmal 23.3 percent in
the first half and 28.1 in the
second, giving them a 25.8
percentage overall.

Few teams, let alone a
struggling one like the Pitt squad,
could overcome an opponent
shooting over 60 percent from
the floor to win a game. Combine
a hot-shooting opponent with
your own shooting woes, and
that shows immediate signs of a
long game.

“You cannot win any games
shooting like we did tonight," Pitt
head coach Kirk Bruce said. “It
was a combination of them
playing good, tight defense and
us just taking some questionable
shots. I’d say of the 30 shots we
took in the first half, over half of
them were shots that when we
normally try them, they do not go
in.”

While the Panthers’ low
percentage can be contributed to
bad shots, the Huskies mark can
be chalked up to taking a lot of
high-percentage shots. Of the four
main players in the Connecticut
frontcourt, no one shot less than
70 percent. Lobo and Pattyson
both nailed seven of 10 shots
from the floor.

Starting center Stacey Wetzel
hit all three of her attempts from
the floor, as well as both her
shots from the charity stripe on
her way to eight points.

Kathy Ferrier continued the
trend of hot shooting, canning all
four of her field goals and two
out of three from the line to finish
with 10.

“They made a lot of their shots

  
  

from the inside, and we have to
contribute that in part to our
defense down low,” Bruce said.‘
“We did a poor job of defending
down low. That in turn led to
fouls because [the Lady Panthers]
became to eager to try and stop
them the next time. One thing
just seems to lead to another.
Tonight it went from them scoring
on us to us fouling them too
much.”

Particularly hurt by the referee's’
whistle was Panther star forward
Jonna Huemrich. Huemrich was
limited to only 19 minutes of
play, four points and two boards,
all far below her season averages.
She played only three minutes in
the second half before picking
up her deadly ﬁfth foul.

Also picking up ﬁve fouls were
starting center Carolyn Miller and
reserve guard Carol Morton.
Morton fouled out with 6:35 left,
and Miller was disqualiﬁed with
2:21 to go, but not before she
scored 14 points and snagged
nine boards.

Pitt never really had a chance
in this game, tying it at the two-
and four—point plateaus.

The Huskies went on a 17-4
run that lasted almost nine
minutes, extending their lead to
21-7 before the Panthers could
catch their breath.

Pitt cut it back to eight at 6:01

before Connecticut took off and’

stretched its lead out to a 19-
point, 42-23 halftime gap.

The second half did not
improve things for the Panthers,
as the Huskies doubled their
second-half point total, 48-24.
UConn led by 44, 85-39, before
the massacre ended at 90-47.

O O
W1ll1s
To tell you the truth, I wouldn’t

be the least bit surprised to hear
this announcement in the near

A‘ future. Not after reading the flyer
which was distributed to students

attending Tuesday night’s Pitt-
UConn game, which in effect
told the students to sit down so
that people behind them could
see the game without standing.

This is an outrage. There is no
other word that can so aptly
describe the situation. Coming
near the end of what has been a
bright year for the team in terms
of fan support, this flyer of
suppression is ludicrous.

Here’s why: Pitt has no fan
tradition. I don’t have to go into
great detail to inform anybody
that the “crowds” at Fitzgerald
the past few years have been

silent and inactive. This year,
however, has seen some great
strides made in the area of
continual support: “The Field
House Fanatics" are just one
example of this. This one
innocuous letter puts a severe
damper on all that.

The ilyer reads: “Several years
ago our students began a tradition
of standing and clapping until
the Pitt team scores its first basket.
We applaud that and encourage
you to continue this tradition.
When that first basket has been
scored, however, we would ask
that all students resume sitting 
This has created a severe problem
for everyone seated behind them,
including other students and all
Ijcketholders in the upper stands.”

My initial reaction to this was,
“Oh, so those party-hardy fellows
in the Athletic Department are
gonna tell the students how to act
during games?”

That kind of ou tburst, however,
misses the real point. Pitt is a
university comprised, the last time
I looked, of students, faculty,
staff and administration. Students
play on the basketball team, and
most, if not all, of the people who
tend to cheer for the team are

Sit-down letter insulting to

students. If you take the students
out of the Field House, the
remaining crowd would be so
silent that Clayton Hartman, the
P.A. announcer, wouldn’t need a
microphone.

Those folks who can't see, or
who won’t stand up, in the upper
stands usually don’t cheer. Oh,
they’ll clap occasionally, but I
have never heard one single
chorus of “Let's Go Pitt” originate
from those sections. It’s the
cheerleaders and the students
who do the cheering, and to
suppress that is an insult to the
students, the cheerleaders and
the team.

As I read over the rest of the
letter, I noticed that the Pitt
cheerleaders’ title was attached
to the bottom, along with that of
the athletic department and the
Office of the Vice President for
Student Affairs.

This has to be another joke.
Why would the cheerleaders
endorse a request for the students
to sit? They wouldn’t, because
thatwould jeopardize all the work
they’ve done this season and
minimize their efforts during the
game. Generally speaking, the
goal of the cheerleaders is to get

the students to be as loud as they
can be, and this would seem to
be a step backward.

The main reason many students
stand is that they enjoy jumping
around, taunting the opposing
players and coaches and because
they like to make noise. Evidently
this isn’t important to the athletic
department, although I wouldn’t
discount its importance to the
team. It’s a lot harder to get into
the game and have fun while
sitting down. Just look at the
people in the upper stands. When
challenged, they’ll spring into
their well-known lethargy.

Most schools in major college-
basketball conferences would be
proud of students who showed
their support by standing
throughout the game. Right now,
I can't think of one program that
explicitly discourages it the way
that Pitt does. At Duke, the school
by which all other fans are
measured, the seats in Cameron
Indoor Stadium won’t have to be
replaced for years because no
one sits in them. Same thing for
all the schools which have a
tradition of great fan support.

Remember way back in 1989,

when Pitt beat then-second-

THE pm NEWS, Thursday, ‘February 27, 1992

Pitt students

ranked Oklahoma at the Field
House? I can remember it clearly:
The game was on a Sunday at
noon, and nobody sat down.
Throughout the long television
timeouts, every second of the
game, nobody sat. It was an
exhilarating feeling for those who
were there, as Pitt won in front of
the whole nation. Of course, the
athletic department probably
would not have wished that the
students sit down for that game,
so why now? The answer, as
usual, probably has something to
do with M-O-N-E-Y.

Someone in the upper stands
complained to the athletic
department about not being able
to see during games, and this
letter seems to indicate what really
matters to the athletic department:
the satisfaction of those who
purchase tickets and, on the
average, might give money back
to Pitt.

Every university should seek to
maintain good relations with its
alumni and the surrounding
community, but not at the
expense of its students. Yes, the
"administration has a point when
it says that everybody should be
given an opportunity to see the
game if they bought a ticket. But
not at the obvious expense of the
students, who are the main
supporters of the team at games,
anyway.

This is at students’ university.
The basketball team is made up
of students and is entitled to
receive the support of the
students, which should not be
unreasonably restricted. This
letter, this request, goes against
that, and it is a sham.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February 27, 1992

 

Pitt needs consistency to win again

The Pitt basketball team needs
at least one more victory to be
invited to the NCAA postseason
tournament. If Pitt plays like it
did in the first half against St.
John's last Saturday night, forget
it! If Pitt plays like it did in the
second half of the St.John’s game
and again in the Connecticut game
on Tuesday night, then maybe
the Panthers have a chance.

I think the Panthers made a
fabulous comeback late in the
second half of Saturday’s game.
It’s a shame Pitt was down by 20
points at halftime, though. That is
just too many points to make up,
especially on the road. But at
least such a -strong second half
shows some promise for the
Panthers going into the last leg of
their schedule. And they didn't
letup from thatsecond-half surge.

On Tuesday night Pitt stayed
hot and played like Wildfire,
beating a Connecticut team that
seemed like it couldn't miss. Chris
McNeal rose to the occasion and
scored 23 points on a night when
Pitt needed him to do so. He has
been criticized in the past for
being non—existent against top-
quality teams._

Also, Sean Miller played a
fantastic ﬂoor game after a night
where he had his poorest ﬂoor

Stephen
Flinn

game in quite some time.

Pitt's remaining schedule is not
easy. One game is at home against
Boston College, which beat Pitt
on the road. Two games are
away at Villanova and
Georgetown. Pitt beat Villanova
at home, but the Wildcats are

"always tough on Pitt when they

play at Villanova. Pitt’s ﬁnal game

is at Georgetown.

Not only did Georgetown beat
Pitt at the Civic Arena, but the
Hoyas are the hottest team in the
Big East right now. They are in
first place and just beat Syracuse
on Sunday in the Carrier Dome.

So all Pitt has to do is win its
remaining home game against
Boston College, and it will more
than likely be invited to the NCAA
postseason tournament. Any
other victories past that are gravy
and will serve to give Pitt a better
seed in the tournament. However
if this doesn’t happen, the
Panthers will have a chance to
pad their schedule during the Big
East postseason tournament in
March. That is Pitt’s wild card

among the nation's Top 25
teams.

Pitt defeated two Top 10
squads, Ohio State and
Clarion, as well as ranked
West Virginia and
Bloomsburg. Four of Pitt's
six losses came at the hands
of ranked opposition; Penn
State, Navy, Clemson and
Lock Haven. This was a

right now. Because with 16’
victories, Pitt is riding on top of
the NCAA Tournament fence post
and could fall either way.

We will have to wait and see
which team shows up for the
Panthers’ remaining games --
the team that played in the first
half of the St. John's game and
could do no right or the team that
showed up in the second half of
the St. John’s game and the entire
Connecticut game and played
great defense, pounded the
boards and had an offensive game
with some rhythm.

That has been a problem this
entire season for the Panthers.
Head coach Paul Evans and the
fans have no idea which team
will be playing the game on any
given night. The good Pitt
Panthers, who will rise to the
occasion and play over their
heads, or the poor Pitt Panthers,
who will underachieve and play
terribly. As was said on the game
show “To Tell The Truth,” will
the real Pitt Panthers please stand

up?

tremendous improvement over
last season's 4-12 dual-meet
mark, which includeda 1-6 EWL
slate.

After all the talk about EWLS,
the time has finally arrived for
the Panthers to solely
concentrate on them.

“I think everybody is really
looking forward to it. A lot of
the upperclassmen know what
they have to do,” Kloiber said.

The half-life of a comic
book can usually be
measured in months; if it's
lucky, years. Even rarer is
a comic book which
knows precisely when it
will finish.

Cerebus is slated to end
in March 2004, a life of 27
years. Only Dave Sim has
written, drawn and
published Cerebus, and he
will be the only person to
do so until it is completed.
Last weekend Sim visited
Pittsburgh as part of the
U.S. '92 tour promoting
Cerebus, attending a

for 12 more.”

In 1977 Cerebus began
as a mercenary, got entangled
in a bureaucracy to become
prime minister, quit after
becoming frustrated with
governmental impotence,
wound up a pawn of 3
powerful politician to be
catapulted to Pope and, after
riding a black tower to the
moon, was Pope no more.
This took roughly 110 issues.
The comic then slowed down
and dealt with more allegorical
themes (death, marriage,
love).

Cerebus then became an

convention on Sunday and
signing issues at comic stores
around the area on Friday and
Saturday.

Cerebus is an aardvark living
in a Middle Ages framework who
doesn't use personal pronouns,
and Cerebus is his life, more or

less. Sim gets somewhat
exasperated when people ask
him what Cerebus is about: “If I
could say what Cerebus was
about in five paragraphs, I
wouldn't have done it for 14
years. I wouldn't keep doing it

out lodging.

unwanted houseguest and
found himself battling an entire

Cerebus will end when Cerebus

Central in Sim’s mind, and to
Cerebus’uniqueness, is the idea

to end. Most comics don’t have a
consistent storyline in mind
because the number of writers
and artists who serve their

graphic-arts student, said Sim is
“best whenever he keeps his
verbosity to a minimum." Sim

time each have their own
vision. Instead, main-
stream comics frequently
rely on one-issue stories
which sell comics
(“Appearing in this issue:
The Punisher! Ghost
Rider! Spider-Mani”) but
are short on character
development and in-
volved plots, terms people
don’t normally think
apply to comics.

One of the obstacles
Sim has had to overcome
is the perception of
comics as kids’ stuff.
Neither people used to
reading comics nor

people new to comics were used

to the sometimes—wordless issue.

At the Phantom of the Attic in
Oakland, Sim’s first stop last

Saturday, several people
nervously milled around 15
minutes before Sim’s arrival. Half
an hour later, Sim’s fans packed
the store, and it remained so until
he left.

For two hours, the calm,
reddish—blond Sim stood behind
the front desk and shook hands
with all the fans before signing

their comics. Because there were ‘

so many, there was not a chance
for more than a few cursory thank
yous (“Great work on the book.”
“Thanks for your support. ”) until

Family life vs. career dféams fuels This Is My Life

By Lori M. Bossert
Staff‘ Writer

What happens when a single
mother’s lifelong dreams of
stardom come true? This 15 My
Life, a film by Nora Ephron and
Lynda Obst, attempts to find out.

Jewish mother Dottie Ingles
(Iulie Kavner) is the funniest thing
at the cosmetic counter at Macy’s
in New Jersey. She spends her
days using her ready sense of
humor to coax customers into
buying placenta cream and worse.
At night, she goes home to her
two daughters, Erica (Samantha
Mathis) and Opal (Gaby
Hoffmann). Their bedtime ritual
includes a “rehearsal” for her
dreamed-about appearance on
“The Tonight Show.” When

Dottie’s aunt dies, Dottie uses the
inheritance money to move to I

New York and pursue her dream
of a career in stand-up comedy.

Alternately narrated by Kavner
and Mathis, the film gives two
perspectives on Dottie’s meteoric
rise to stardom. She quickly gets
an agent (Carrie Fisher), an
associate of comedy mogul
Arnold Moss (Dan Aykroyd). After
meeting Moss, Dottie’s career is
put on the fast track. Booked for
the club scene in L.A., Kavner
tries to navigate the rocky road of
Hollywood stardom, while Mathis
and Hoffmann are given a series
of Dottie’s comedian friends as
babysitters.

Suddenly transformed, from part
of a close-knit -family to.-rthe
children of a star, the girls try to
adjust to their mother’s fame and
absence. They begin to see her
on television more often than

Julie Kavner plays aspiring comediene Dottie Ingles in This Is My

Life, Nora Ephron’s directorial debut.

they do in person. Supportive at
first, they grow increasingly
critical of their mother as she is
gone longer and longer.

The climax comes when Dottie
arrives home as a surprise, only
to find Erica giving a scorching
imitation of her. After the ensuing
fight, the family begins working
toward a more balanced life —
for all of them.

“‘I don’t know how to explain
what happened to’ me,” Dottie
explains. “It’s like I was shot into
orbit. The air was thinner. I lost
my mind. And I wish more than

 

anything that it happens to you.
Only I hope it happens before
you have children, because
afterwards it’s complicated. It's
very complicated.”

“This Is My Life” handles the
tough issues and choices faced

by the Ingels family with a
refreshing honesty which is rare
in Hollywood. No one is blamed
or absolved in this funnyjtouching
drama about career women and
the choices they must make.

Kavner is excellent as
comedienne Dottie Ingels. She
blends biting wit with a mother’s
tenderness and believably
presents both the joys and sorrows
of her character's rising star. Her
delivery as a stand-up
comedienne is convincing and
amusing.

Mathis does equally well as
Erica, the older daughter.
Reaching adolescence at the same
time her mother reaches stardom,
she is forced to deal with the
trials of her first love, as well as

Flashback: Sunday night, Oct.
13, 1991.

I wandered into the Upstage
Lounge‘ just as Sebadoh was
starting its set. It was loud — so
loud that it almost hurt.

But it didn’t matter. It played
some of the most memorable,
heartfelt post-punk-rock noise
I've ever heard.

Sebadoh (pronounced SEB-uh-
doh) left any trace of a we’re—so-
cool, we-don’t-have-to-be-in-
tune-or-tight attitude in the alley
behind the club. It just plowed
through the set. At the climax of
one dirge, bassist Jason
Lowenstein kept repeating, “It’s
just a f@#‘ing joke; it’s just a

’ f@#‘ing joke” until the song fell

apart. That summed up the band
right there: l)on’t take it too
seriously. Just listen. Methinks

QUIRKY, MURKY AND INDEPENDENT

Pussy Galore/ cracking jokes
like Thurston Moore/ pedal

there aren’t too many folks like
that these days.

“That was the epitome of all
that’s good about underground
music today," I told someone, as
the song ended. I went home a
changed man.

Sebadoh started out as a side
project for Eric Gaffney and
Dinosaur Jr. bassist Lou Barlow.
They made some lo-fi, homemade
recordings that caught the ears of
the folks at Homestead Records.

 

Homestead released the tapes in
1989 on the album 7beFreedMcm
around the time Lou parted
company with Dinosaurjr. Weed
Forestm came out a year later.
Both albums were a hodgepodge
of potential classics, half-ﬁnished
ideas and noise pieces. Most
people didn’t know what to make
of them: real band or just a studio
project?

All such questions were
answered last year. First,

Lowenstein joined on
bass and drums and
turned the band into a
well-oiled machine. Then
the single “Gimme Indie
Rock” came out, wherein
Barlow threw potshots at
his peers and old chums
in underground music,
lampooning the style I
would later praise him
for doing well:

“Hangin’ loose with

hoppin’ like Dinosaur,”
punctuating that last line with a
trademark Dinosaur screaming-

.boy-guitar lead; “It’s a new

generation of electric, white-
boy blues!” It was funny, and it
was right on target.

But the band’s high point
came with Sebadoh III, a bold,
23-song magnum opus.
Whatever dimension the earlier

albums lacked, Sebadoh made up
for threefold on this release.
Gaffney’s fuzzed-out pop songs
start out pretty and invariably have
at least one screaming ﬁt in the
middle. The album’s final cut, “As
The World Dies, The Eyes Of God
Grow Bigger,” is like a battle‘
between the id and ego. Barlow’s
acoustic love songs were the kind
that every insecure punk geek
wishes he could sing to impress
his girlfriend, insecure but sincere
as all getout. Lowenstein also threw
in a couple introspective numbers.
With so many bands out today
that try to write funny songs, it’s
good to hear a band like Sebadoh
write clever lyrics and not forget to
come up with some good music to
put behind them. -

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, February 27, 1992

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

So it is that a woman’s role is no
longer dependent upon her man.
Today’s women are balancing
their professional goals and
achievements against their private
ambitions, and Hollywood has
pumped female oxygen like this
right onto the big screen. As
women are forced to choose
between career and/ or family (i.e
husband, children), it seems
Hollywood is actively pursuing
the former and the independence
and inner strength that bear its
mark.

Along the way, female
characters are permitted to love,
weep, wail, find passion, usually
lose, but more importantly grow
and learn from their experiences.
Could it be that Hollywood is
coming to grips with reality?

The argument still favors the
negative for obvious reasons. Stop
Or My Mom Will Shoot and
Necessary Roughness, albeit both
“male—dominated” films, are
dually excellent answers. But
when it comes to female leading
ladies, the cinema seems to be
recoding female desires.

_ Take Barbara Striesand’s The
Prince Of Tides, where the
character rediscovers love (which
her husband had not been able to
give her), then loses it (despite its
hankie atmosphere). Her want is
to remain with Nick Nolte, but
her realization is that she always
knew he would return to his
wife. Allowing the character to
know she was going to get burned

' seems to play upon female

independence and its willingness
to re-evaluate Mr. Right. (Nolte is
all that and more to Striesand.)
While it may be a steamy affair
for both Striesand and Nolte, it is
also a shining example of

Seb adoh—

Continued from page S-4
Pa., taking hits off a scotchguard-
powered bong and recording
songs on their four-track recorder,
taking breaks only to get food at
El Taco Loco. The result: the new
Ween album, The Pod.

Whether Dean and Gene are
actually brothers is beyond me,
but all of the above is true. Ween’s
new double album is a potpourri
of twisted folk rock that sounds
right at home on the Shimmy
Disc label. The band runs the
gamut, from distorted T. Rex-
type vocals and songs recorded
on the wrong speed (slower, of
course) to one cut that has a man
ordering Mexican food. If you
needed a reason not to do
scotchguard bongs, here you go.
Better to just sit back and soak up
the aura.

What either ofthese two bands
will sound like at the Upstage
next week is anyone’s guess. Will
Ween feature a guest appearance
by comrade Mean Ween (a.k.a.
Shimmy Discman Kramer)? Will
Sebadoh make my life happier
once again?

There's only one way to find
out, and that's to show up on
Tuesday at the Upstage Lounge.
Get there early because locals Salt
Chunle Mary and Love Naplein
will get things going around 7:30
p.m. And don't forget your
earplugs.

tightly-wrapped, nuclear-family
structures, honesty and, “I just
want to be respected" as vehicles
for contentment in favor of selfish
(but is it wrong or even portrayed
as wrong) struggles,‘ thus
representing smart, self-
preserving women who are
willing to take the risks, lotto
winner or another wasted dollar.
The same goes for love, which
may be in the foreground, but is
not omnipresent or even
immortal. —

of the Gustave Flaubert novel,

The retlepicting of women ’5 passion in film  It  

Striesand’s inner strength and
cinema’s newfound female
heroines.

Also in this new wave is the
clash between sex and love. No
longer intertwined as needed for
both to forge as one, the new
female cinema underlines love as
the more powerful and sex as just
a part of the greater whole. (Of
course, not all movies are part of
this grouping.) In Prince Of Tides

this accent on love is the primary
staple between Nolte and
Striesand’s relationship, not the
traditional lust-ﬁlled, sex-crazed
excursions that fueled films such
as Fatal Attraction or newer
efforts like Lizzie Borden’s Love
Crimes or Final Analysis. (But
what can we expect from Richard
Gere and Kim Basinger?)

“The Way I Walk” and “Human

Alex Chilton, didn’t make any
kind of startling innovation or
rebellious statement against the
cock ‘n’ roll establishment so
besieged at the time by the punk-
rock usurpers. No, these here
Cramps didn’t invent nothin.’
What they did was bring the
mouldering corpse of rock ‘n’ roll
back to the lab and juice it with
the necessary voltage. They have

it ever since.

I’m talking about a genre. You
need a label?!? The Cramps have
psychobilly stitched in their
underwear. Lux Interior (vox)
and Poison Ivy Rorschack (geetar)
lay claim to its (re)bi.rth way back
in ’72, when Lux picked her up
hitchhiking. What it is is a dirty,
rotten mess of instrumental surf
rock, psychedelia (whatever that
is), '60s garage rock and the cult
of B—movie horror schlock  rock!
Awrtghﬂl?

Soon after Chilton (still
auguring, by the way) first put
the finger on The Cramps, the
1978 EP Gravest Hits snagged
them a seat on the U.K. leg of a
Police tour. I can’t imagine that it
was more fun to hang out with
Sting than Stiv Bators, but things
were deﬁnitely looking up. But
were they fulfilled?

Bovary

Continued from page S-5
I frankly have never read, but as
Chabrol himself says, “All the
dialogue, all the phrases of the
ﬁlm are taken, almost to the
comma, from the book.”

So going under his assumption
and subsequent reviews, the film
engages itself primarily upon the
madame’s life and struggles. Set
in the late 19th century in the
blatantly scenic French
countryside, Chabrol covers
extensive terrain pertaining to
the plot. The madame, Emma,
played grippingly at times by
Isabelle Huppert, is obviously
the focus of the film. She marries
a rniddle—class doctor, who at
first offers her an escape from her
boring, caretaking, countryside
manner, but eventually she
becomes disgruntled and cries
passion. Doctor Bovary, played
byJean—Francois Balmer, is a mix
between Peter Sellers’ classic
Inspector Clouseau and a drab
medicine man. The good doctor
is unable to satisfy his lover, not
that Clouseau ever could.

Thehcouple moves to a larger
French town, where Emma
discovers her wants and desires.
She is clearly in control of the
relationship, but she lacks love
and, more importantly, romance.
This film does wonders for the
idealistic view that all French do
is sit around and muse love in
scenic settings. After attending
an elite societal ball, she proclaims
that it was the most memorable

moment of her life and proceeds
to name her firstborn “Berthe,” a
name she heard dropped at the
ball. The problem is that Chabrol
doesn’t allow us to really grasp
the momentum of the ball, or of
Bovary’s desires. He only points
to them by showing her boredom
through knitting and the like. As
for the “most memorable” ball
scene, it is almost cinematically
forgettable.

Emma eventually takes lovers.
Leon (Lucas Belvaux), her first, is
a young law clerk seeking higher
societal advancement. He woos
her with romantic poetry that
sends her into a tizzy. If Leon is

her spiritual need—bringer, then
Rodolpho (Christophe Malavoy)
is her lustful and sexual fulﬁller.

A wealthy landowner, Emma risks
all for him, including a failed
elopement. In a Woody Allen
short story, “The Kugelmass
Episode,” the lead character is
magically thrust into the text of
Madame Bovary in a search for
sexual fulﬁllment. He finds it
eagerly in the ready Emma, but
Kugelmass refuses to jump into
the novel before she meets

Rodolpho, for fear that he will

even outswoon him and the

magic.

Rodolpho, rediscovers Leon,
spends all of her husl§and’s money
on expensive Parisian fashion,
realizes that her lovers were
nothing more than that and unable
to help her in her financial bind.
Things turn tragic as Bovary drinks
arsenic out of total frustration,
humiliation and unfulfillment.

The story is a tragedy that
harbors not on social or political
discourse, but solely on Emma’s
suffering. For her, sex is not
something to do because she is
bored.

She is bored because she has
social aspirations that her husband
is unable to feed, and she turns to
others in hopes of satisfaction.
Sex is not something she does for
pleasure, but because she sees it
in broad, romantic terms, full of
warmth and feeling and honesty.
She suffers because she cannot
find love, which she views as
something that can conquer

all.

While Hollywood grapples with
this question, Madame Bovary
shows both past and now—clearer
female cinematic expressions. As
love is shown as an avalanche of
all—surrounding happiness, Emma
struggles as she cannot discover
its rewards. But her search and
desire can be seen as a choice
that today’s career ladies
(something Emma had no
concern for in those drastically
different times) must also grapple
with.

I've seen a lot worse French

ﬁlms involving romance, but
Chahrol’s paved directorial ﬂair
injures Emma’s romantic needs
and desires. There ’splentyoftime
for you to malee up your own
mind. Madame Bovary runs
through March 26 at The
Pittsburgh Playhouse, 222 Craﬂ
Street right here in scenic
Oaleland.

The film also suffers from a
slow pace throughout Dottie’s
rise to stardom, coupled with a
resolution which comes a bit
quickly and jerkily in comparison.
Still, it is worth seeing for its
strong performances and honest
handling of some tough issues.
Funny and often-touching, it is
mostly a watchable film.

he doesn’t have to answer to

He isn’t such a cog in the

McFarlane [two popular artists
from Marvel Comicsl.”

Allen also pointed out Cereous
has been around longer than both
companies which distribute
comics to the East coast.

One of Sim’s main selling points
— to both distributors and retailers
-— is that Cerebus has been around
14 years and will be around for
12 more.

It won’t fade away like other
independent comics.

Asked about the reason people
not into comics are attracted to
Cerebus, Sim thought for a
moment and replied, “In this day
and age, if you have something
you want to get published, you’d
have to go to Tundra or be
distributed by Eclipse. Self-
publishing is something we
don’t want to run out of
completely.”
