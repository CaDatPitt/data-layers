  Abraham Over Watterson In Landslide Presidential Race

By ROBIN L; LUBIC
‘ Pitt News Stat'fWriter
Bill Abraham overcame in-

cumbent Kim Watterson 1,500 to
500 votes to clinch the Student
Government Board presidency,
Wednesday night.

Eight under graduates, Bernard
L. Palowitch, Janice Faller, Berna-
dette Herward, Joe Blazer, Alan
Mele, Martin Bertocchi, Walter
Burke, and Scot Hendler, all
secured places on the board.

, Burke’s position on the board

may change due to a discrepence of
campaign spending. Burke over-
spent the set $50 campaign
spending budget by four cents.
"According" to Mark Suekoff,
chairman of elections committee, a
hearing is scheduled for tonight to
determine whether or not Burke
should be disqualiﬁed. If Burke is
disqualiﬁed, Peter Germain will be
the next person in line for the
position.

last Friday, with all thereceipts, I
knew I was over four cents, but that
seemed a trifle,” said Burke.

Burke stated that 'the over
spending was due to the fact that
he neglected the calculate state tax
when ordering his campaign
posters. .

“If my election is going to, be
over for four cents, then 781
people’s choice doesn’t matter,”
said Burke. »

“I am happy to see that the
people did get out and vote.
Compared to past -voter turnouts it
was good, and that shows student
support which SGB cannot do
anything without,” said Abraham.

Bernard Palowitch stated that he
wanted to commend the people that

did turn out to vote, because it,

shows they.still have interest in the _

workings of the SGB.

The voting turnout was only a
12.5 -percent increase from last
year. According to Joe Blazer,» this
was really disappointing, but even

so, the newly elected board seems
excited about the coming year.

“I’m pleased with the new
members, I feel the people elected
and I are a very workable group.
We will get a long well together,”
said Blazer. .

Abraham stated that when the
new board meets for the first time
his priorities are to start with a new
atmosphere, and to begin to bring
SGB to the students.

Burke stated that he was ready to
get the show on the road, and
concurs with Abraham’s goal of
bringing SGB to the people.
He plans to accomplish this by
implementing the notion of going
from group to group to get input.

“By being circuit riders we
would demonstrate we really care
and we want the students to be
involved, whether they like it or
not,” said Burke.

Alan Mele cited his goal as

trying to receive more financial aid

Student'TempersF|are During Iranian Discussion

By«SUE McFARLAND
‘Pitt News Staffwriter ,

One of the initial displays of
unrest on the Pitt campus -over the
holding of American hostages in

Tehran surfaced Wednesday even-
ing. during an open discussion on
Iran in the Graduate School of
Public Health Auditorium.

The discussion, sponsored by the
Anti-Imperialist Student Union and
Americans for Justice in the
Middle East was
sporadic outbursts of emotion from
opposing forces of Iranian students
who want the shah returned to Iran

_ and Americans concerned for the

safety of the 62 hostages being held
in the U.S. Embassy in Iran.
Debbie Ehrlich, moderator of the
discussion and coordinator of the
,entire rally compared the ﬁght of
_;the— Iranians to America’s ﬁght for

ﬁndependence in 1776.

“In 1776, Americans fought for
freedom in a revolution, today the
Iranians are ﬁghting a similar
battle, one that the Americans
should .be able ’ to sympathize
with.” _‘

Ehrlich, who seeks the return’ of
the shah to Iran also drew
comparisons between the shah and’
Adolph Hitler.

Ehrlich introduced Hamid

attempted to convey what he
believed to be the plight of the
Iranian people under the reign of

Ashraph was greetedby shouts
of ‘Death to the Shah’ from one
faction of the audience and
choruses of ‘God Bless America’
from another group of students.

Ashraph conveyed his feelings

“In the 26 years the people of
Iran, didn’t even have basic
rights,” Ashraph said. If you’d'
ask questions ofthe government of
Iran, all you”d get would be jail,

torture or killing. - s

“I would like to appeal, t9,,all_,  

cause you’ve already had two bad

. experiences with that in Korea and _

then Vietnam.”

John «Beverly, professor of
Hispanic studies at Pitt compared
the shah’s regime to that of former
Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio
Somoza. ’

“Both dictators were brought in
bylan American CIA coup and both

dictators managed to maintain ,'

themselves by torture,” Beverly
said.. -

“Iran and Nicaragua are both
desperately poor countries, but
both the shah and Somoza. spent

much of the income of their :

countries on technology to build up
their countries’ armies—armies
that were later used against their
own people.” ' ’

said Mele.
Mele seems to feel that Germain

' and Daloni suffered in the election

because of their contestment of the
ESC. -

“All three of us wrote a letter to
the elections committee saying that .2
the ESC was using bribery for
votes, and as a result we all
suffered at Benedum. I had
enough support elsewhere to pull
through,” said Mele.

“Mele, Daloni and Germain
were interested in the student body

didn't appeal to the governance
groups. It isn’t right that the
governance groups should have
such effect on the outcome of an
election which is V set up to-
represent the student body as a

Iranian Talks Heated As
Student Tempers Boil

(Continued from page 1)
Beverly concluded by stating
that he wasn’t sure whether the
seizing of the U.S. embassy was

the correct method of seeking the _

return of the shah Iran, but that he‘
did believe the U.S. should begin
extradition procedures against the
shah immediately.

Later in the evening the floor was
opened up for discussion by the
more than 100 people in attend-
ence. I

There were several factions
apparent in the" audience——those
Americans who wantedthe Amer-
ican hostages returned despjte the
cost involved, those who sought the

_ return of the shah to Iran, _and

those who approached the "return of
the shah to Iran under any
circumstances due to fear of setting
some type ‘of precedent posing a

‘danger to all American tourists‘

abroad. »

“Speaking of free speech is
ludicrous because there is no free
speech in Iran,” said Bruce
Doebler, a member of Pitt’s
English faculty, and a member of

Wednesday evening's audience.~

“But if we give in to this, no
American will have any right to

safety, while traveling anywhere.’ ’

‘is a mass murderer.

The emotions Jof American
students in attendence were
running high, some voicing resent-
ment over the Iranian students
presence in the U.S., some
admitting their only concern

centered around the safe return 0:‘

the 62 American hostages, not the
welfare of‘ the shah.

.“I don’t want to see a war, but
there is no way to start an honest
intelligent conversation with us by
taking 65 people who had nothing
to do with this, who only a 9-5
job,” Pitt student Phil Cillo said_.

One Iranian audience member '

said the fate of the shah should be
placed with the Iranian people.

“The U.S. government should
not be concerned with the shah; he’
Return the
“shah to Iran and let the Iranian
people or any other people of the
world decide what to do.”

The heated discussion ended
with no major incidents of violence.

Pitt campus police were sta-
tioned outside the building while
plainclothed police patrolled the-
halls outside the rally.

According to campus police chief
Curt Graham, no violence has

occurred on campus as a result of '

the Iranian situation.

Goodluck

The Student Government Board elections are
finally over. Marked by scandal, backstabbing and
inordinate amounts of gossip and rumors, this year’s
election was the worst in recent memory, if one
considers the short amount of time spend by
candidates debating issues. Pitt students cannot
predict how this board will perform we can only wait
and see how the newly elected officials react to
situations-and decisions confronting them as their
terms in office progress. I _ .

The new board members have a tough job ahead of
them. They must learn the workings of the
governmental system at Pitt, how to negotiate with
stubborn administrators, and how to handle
academics while performing their representative
function efficiently.

In order to assist SGB president-elect Bill
Abraham and his eight board members, we would

MARK MUFtPHY,’Managlng Editor

 

like to offer some suggestions and pointers for them
to consider when performing their duties.

The most important priority right now is to set up
goals and objectives - the next twelve months.
Virtually every SGB in the past has done the same,
but they rarely follow with these plans. A common
mistake of these past boards has been that their list of
goals was much too long and unrealistic. The new
board should choose four or five programs or

' policies that they could realistically develop and

implement. .

A consistent mistake in the past has been that a
new board takes office knowing little about the
student government process, the university
bureaucracy, or the art of negotiation.
Administrators, particularly the Student Affairs
division, immediately offer ‘their help, making
suggestions and taking new board members'under
their wings. _

Beware of this phenomenon. _Learn to work wit
the administrators on a professional basis. Many
times in the past the board has_ simply become
another arm of the university, part of the massive
bureaucracy which has stifled so many student
government members in the past. It is important that

Page 4—Friday, November 16, 1979

the individual board members keep their

independence. -
Every board inherits problems and incomplete

projects from their predecessors. It is important that

-these problems are solved and the projects

completed. Good examples of ..problems and
programs that still need to be addressed are the
quality of the Food Service, the proposal to build an
FM radio station at Pitt, rerouting the campus bus,
and renovating the student union. . '
Internally, the new SGB should be wary of
developing alliances and/ or rivalries. These tend to

make the board ineffective, inconsistent,. and?

basically non—functional. In the past, board
members have spent much of their time fighting one
another whilereal problems, those that effect their
constituents pile up and are never resolved. Each
board member’s views and ideas should be respected
and considered equally; Pitt does not need‘ another
do-nothing student government.

The Pitt News wishes the new Board members
good luck with their new responsibilities. We only
hope that the new boardican mobilize support from
the student body and be a strong voice for Pitt’s
undergraduates.

Bored Individuals at Pitt Capita|izingOn Mid-Eastern Situation

I am neither Persian, nor was I
Neither “looking
foreign” nor having an accent
eliminates the possibility of one
,from being a citizen of the U.S. So
"stop asking me (and others) if I am
Persian. ‘

It was the Japanese, including
American Japanese, who needed
“protection” at one time; now it's
the Persians! Imagine, we are
forced to warn Persian students,
any Persian, and anyone who may
look or sound like one, to keep a
low profile!

There exist a number of bored
individuals who are capitalizing on
the recent issue, getting emotional,

and making their lives more
exciting by making others” quite
miserable. Since they neither have
enough imagination, nor a suffi-
cient dose ofjintelligence, these
“turkeys” show their allegiance to
the U.S. by asking too many ques-

tions to people who may be guilty ‘

only of being there at the wrorlg
time.

There seems to be a tendency for
some people to either cook up an
incidence or wait for an event to

“let it all out.” Following the

Steelers’ and Pirates’ victory

“celebrations,” I_ should not be .

surprised to witness violence or
harassment as means of satisfying
one's needs or whims.

It is unfortunate that these

I am not naive enough to believe

Administrative

Blunder

Chalk up another blunder to
Pitt’s Administrative branch. For
those of you who have not faced the
traditional joy of paying your
tuition yet, Watch Out! Pitt has
added yet~.another dimension.

I hate to spoil the surprise for
you. but you might be interested to
know that your validation card for

the winter term measures 8 inches _

by 11 inches.- Now try and stick
that in your wallet.

When questioned about the
change from the old validation card
(3% inches by 2% inches) the
cashier said that it had to do with
problems they have had in the past
with different billing services. She

said that I probably. 'wouldn’t be

able to understand it, and that I

should not worry about it..

Apparently the new tuition form is

supposed to ‘consolidate all the old

-forms into one, for organizational

purposes. . _ -

There are two problems with
this new form right off the bat.
First I don’t see why even with this
new form a corner could not be
perforatted (as before), to indicate
validation of tuitions paid. Second
is the fact that this 8-inch by
11-inch validation “card” may

' ‘defeat its own purpose,‘ that being

clarity of information. Maybe the
administrator who omitted the
smaller detachable card from the
new form has never carried an
8-inch by 11-inch sheet of paper in
his wallet for 4 months. '
probably that by the time the term
is ‘half over mine will be illegible,
not because of ill‘-usage, simply by
every day wear and tear, at least
from my own experiences in'the
past, that is what is likely to
happen.
" The only other comments on the
decision Icould get from G33 were:
“It wasn’t a decision of this
office.” I
“You probably won’t be able to

, understand it,” and “It makes it

nice jaw us, and it may be an
inconvenience for students, but..:”

It’s 4

and with a shrug of the shoulders...,*!++»-

u

  

By SAMUEL SCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer
If the Pitt Panthers can put all

‘ .that ridiculous, monotonous, HOU-

productive bowl talk out of their
minds for about three hours
tomorrow afternoon, they should

I - be able to raise their record to 9-1

by defeating the 2-6-1 Army Cadets

, in West Point's Michie Stadium.

Pitt will be going against a team

. whose lone moment of glory in 1979
_ was a 17-13 upset of Stanford

(Stanford ties Southern California
this year). But even Army Coach
Lou Saban, in his ﬁrst year at the

« service academy. found few 800d

things to say about his team and its

H win over Stanford.

“I don’t think it was a case of us
winning that game,” Saban "was

saying Wednesday. “They (Stan--

ford) just lost it. I think they turned

. the ball over eight or nine times.

And that isn’t all Saban had to
say about his team, which has
losses to North Carolina (41-3),

Baylor (55-0), and Boston College
. (29-16).

“In general, I can’t say that
we're a very good football team,”
he said. “There’s nothing I can

' honestly be optimistic about. We

haven't been able to do much with

‘~ our offense this year, and our

defense hasn’t been much better.”
Compounding Saban’sv problems
is the state of the United States,

, andlmore speciﬁcally, the attitude

of young Americans towards the
military. Not only does Saban have
to recruit outstanding athletes, but
he must also recruit great students,
and there is a mandatory five-year
commitment to the U.S. Army
following graduation from West
Point.

“It’s tough to get any young man
to commit himself to the military
life for nine years, so we have
problems there,” Saban explained.
“I do know that Army’s got a long
way to go to get back to where it

 

v ~ ‘

_   Panthers Bound toBow| Over lackluster cadets  

once was in football a long time
ago.” .

On the field, Saban’s team has
been hit with injuries, including a
crucial one to defensive lineman
George Mayes.

The. Cadets run out of the veer
formation, led by quarterback Earl
Mulrane, a 6-foot-3, 215-pound
senior. . _,

But, in all reality, any attempt by
Army to move the ball against
Pitt’s defense will be about as
successful as trying to stop Niagara
Falls with soup strainers, and
tomorrow's game is nothing but an
organized scrimmage before Pitt’s
chance to win at least the Lambert
Trophy, symbolizing Eastern sup-
remacy, in the December 1 game at
Penn State.

*#****II=

. Pitt Coach Jackie Sherrill is
aware of all the bowl talk, and is
trying his best to keep his players’
minds on the issue at hand—Army.

“We know we can’t stop the
speculation, but we have to "keep
our minds on Army this week,” he
said. “Our job will be to beat
Army, and if we do, good things
will probably come our way. We
have to put everything else in the
back of our mind.” -

On the injury list, defensive
tackles Greg Meisner and Bill Neill
are both questionable for tomor-
row. Sherrill might be wise to keep
his -two stalwarts out of action to
ensure they’ll both be at full
strengh for Penn State.

PITT BITS—Dan Marino needs
just over 200 yards passing to move
into the top ten of Pitt’s list of top
single season passing perfor-
mances. He was now thrown for
957 yards, completing 61 percent of
his passes, with seven touchdowns,
one more than Rick Trocano threw
all of last season...Pitt is a 24-point
favorite over Army.

Page :6—Friday, November 16, 1979

Randy McMillan and the rest of the Pitt football team travel to New York tomorrow to face the 2-6-1 Army_Cadets.

Will those Panthers from Pitt get left out in the cold,
even though they have an 8-1 record? Will anyone

get all the bowl bids? For these answers and many
more, tune in next week at this time, when everything
should be cleared _up.
This was supposed to be Army Week for the Pitt
‘football team, but so far it has been Speculation
Week. Everyone from my grandmother to the
neighborhood Monday morning quarterback seems
to know where the Panthers are going, and no one is
A afraid of voicing his’ opinion.
According to coach Jackie Sherrill, he knows as
much about the situation as you and me.
“The only information I receive comes from other

because of several ties in certain conferences, and
they still have to be decided before any bids go out.”

Sherrill is alluding to the three-way tie in the
Southwest Conference between Texas, Arkansas and
Houston, which should be resolved when Texas
meets Houston. All three will probably get a bowl
invitation, with the conference champion going to

the Cotton Bowl.

Every year, thebowl committees make their invita-
tions before the last game of the season. For Pitt,
this is an inconvenience, since the team plays Penn

want Florida State? Will the Southwest Conference

bowls,” he said. “The whole picture is muddled ,

out. Therefore, an impressive win over the Nittany

Lions would be irrelevant’. ; I ' _

The polls as well as the scouts do not seem to think
much of Pitt, the top Eastern team. Critics say that
the Panthers 8-1 record is due to a weak schedule.
This supposed weak schedule includes Temple (81-1

. and 16th in the nation), Washington (17th in the

nation and once fourth), Syracuse, which possesses
one of the better offensive units in the country, and
Navy (undefeated until the Oct. 27 Pitt game and
once 18th in the nation). -

Pitt has beaten all of these teams, and the team’s
only loss came early in the season against a good’
North Carolina squad. /.

If schedules were the main criteria for a bowl bid
(they obviously aren’t), Alabama wouldn’t make the
Alonzo Stagg Bowl. Consider their fierce schedule:
Georgia Tech, Baylor, Vanderbilt, Wichita State,
Florida, Tennessee, Virginia Tech, Mississippi State,
L.S.U., Miami (Fla.) and Auburn. Wichita State?
They would have a hard time winning in intramural

football, much less beating Alabama.‘ Vanderbilt,

7 oe fun.

. Tune in Tomorrow ‘As the Bowl Bids Turn’ For Pitt  

And now it’s time for “As the Bowl Bids Turn,” I Baylor and Miami are teams unlikely to upset the

Tide even if the Bear himself played quarterback.
Yet, Alabma is the No. 1 team in the nation.

According to Sherrill, Pitt ‘has, the luxury of
waiting an extra week before making’ its decision on a
second line bowl. . ‘ r.

“We can wait for an extra week and wait for the
outcome of‘ the key games. and then decide which
bowl will benefit us.the most,” said Sherrill.

This, however, could prove risky. If Pitt waits too
long to make its decision, itcould get left out in the
cold. I , '

Another factor that influences bowl officials is the
‘number of exciting players a team has to lure the big
T.V. such as Bucks, Major Ogilvie and Steadman
Sheally of Alabama, who are household names.
Hugh Green, Dan Marino, Randy McMillan, JoJo
Heath and company must be wondering whatthey
must do to be exciting. Maybe if they played Wichita
State and won 88-0 the scouts would be satisfied.

‘If Pitt goes to a second line bowl (Gator, Liberty
or Fiesta), it’s with the knowledge that the scouts did
not think highly enough of the best team in the East
to send them toga major bowl. The scouts are about
to make the same move they made in 1977 when they
sent Pitt to the Gator Bowl to-humiliate Clemson
while a much weaker Ohio State was getting beaten in
the Sugar Bowl. ,

By the way, whatis there to do in Memphis or
Jacksonville? I thought bowlcities were supposed to
