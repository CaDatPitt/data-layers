Discusses

Duchess

by DR. ROBERTWHITMAN
Professor of English

Of all that brilliant constella-
tion of playwrights subsumed un-
der the label of “Elizabethan
Drama,” by all odds the most‘
controversial is John Webster.
About the man himself we know
virtually nothing beyond what
can be deduced from the mere
handful of plays. he left with his
name attached. And even those
few plays have been the subject
of widely divergent opinions.

Shakespeare may have been,
as Jonson said, “not of an age
but for all time,” the same claim
could not be made for Webster.
Although praised in his own
time, his two best plays, The
White Devel and The Duchess of
Malﬁ, were rarely produced or
even read from the early decades
of the 17th century until the
second half of the 19th, when
they were in a real sense “redis-
covered.” Since then a wide range
of . critics and literary ﬁgures
have paid tribute to Webster’s
genius, many ranking him second
only among the Elizabethans.

It would be a mistake, how-

ever, to come to Webster with the -

assumption that because he was
an Elizabethan, his plays must
be like Shakespeare’s. There is in
Shakespeare's work a clarity of
preception, a sharpness of deﬁni-
tion, which, while neverlsimple-
minded, is curiously reassuring.
Whatever the ambiguities ; and
contradictions of human nature,
the order of the world is essen-
tially a moral one.

The world of Webster’s plays is
-a. far different one, lurid, melo-
dramatic, a little blurred. They
are dominated by Elizabethan
England's picture of Renaissance
Italy: violein-t, bloody, the home
of Machiavellian princes and un-
scrupulous malcontents. And in
VVebster’s hand this image of
Italy spreads out to encompass
the whole visible world. As one
offended Victorian critic put it:
“He had no sober vision of things.
His is‘ a world that reels in a
disastrous twilight of lust and
blood.” But the very qualities
that outraged the sobriety of a
Victorian optimist lie at the heart

of a. “vision -of things” our ownr

age can perhaps better under-
stand.

A later and more perceptive
writer has _described Webster’s
characters as “writhing . . . in an
immense night.” While it would
be misleading to call him an
Elizabethan existentialist or ab-
surdist, there is something pain-
fully modern in Webster’s recur-
rent motif of the struggle to ﬁnd
a meaningful system of values
in a world where values" have
been destroyed.

One of the characters in The

White Devil dies with the words:.

“When we look up to heaven, we
confound knowledge with know-
ledge. Oh, I am in a mist.” And
the echoes of that obscure but
disturbing cry reverberate
through The Duchess of Malﬁ.

Although the Duchess, at her
death, may find meaning and
consolation in traditional values,
the final act focusses on the trag-
ic failure of Bosola to ﬁnd the
Heaven he glimpsed in her eyes,
or to find any values that will
give his life or his revenge mean-
ing. As he says: his is another
voyage.

The Duchess of Malﬁ, for all
its blood and melodrama, is an
intensely —modern play. Those

If after all this time you still don't
know what a Uniroyal is, _\_/v_e_ (the U.S.
Rubber Co.) ought to be shot. Uniroyal
is the new world-wide trademark of the

U.S. Rubber Co. a_n<_:l it also replaces the

dozens of different names and trade-
marks we've been using in 150 countries.

But—what’s wrong with the good old-
fashioned name of U.S. Rubber?

The answer is—we have neither been
old-fashioned nor exclusively U.S. not
exclusively rubber for a very'|ong time.
Just look at some of the excitinglg-
rubber products we make:

    

Royalex,® a thermoplastic for auto and
truck bodies which is not only harder to
dent than steel but, if dented, pops back
as good as new under heat. Sexy Eski-
loos® boots for the ladies, and Keds,®
the famous line of soft, colorful family
shoes that are as easy to look at as they
are to wear. Wet suits for aquanauts. Poly-
crest,® our new olefin fiber, that's more
stain resistant than any other kind of car-
pet fiber alive. Alanap,® a smart weed
killer for fweeds that are too smart for
other weed killers. SBR, a synthetic rub-
ber (from which we make our Rain

-our new world trade-

whats a UniRoyal?

Tires” and Tiger Paws T“) that's tougher,
safer and longer-lasting than natural rub-
ber.

Now you can see why we had to change i

our company's trademark—we needed
a new trademark to better suit our
derring-do. But we're never going to for-
get our forebear, the U.S. Rubber Com-
pany. Neverl. In fact, some of us here
would feel a great deal
better in our hearts if

 

ma_rk read, ”Uniroyal,
son of U.S. Rubber.”

oThe present administration seems determined to build. dorms on the
.'upper campus and the best thing that students can do is to express the

reservations they have about the plan. The proposal has been discussed
further recently, and the idea of the dorms could be made acceptable lf

 
 

certain accommodations are made.

In Friday’s edition of the Pitt News, Dr. Kurtzman announced that
{the University and the General State Authority would jointly construct
‘1residen'ce halls for Pitt in the area of the Fitzgerald Field House. The
._'obvious problem is that of transportation of the students from the Cathe-

:‘ dral area to the dorms up above.

;_ At the University of Louisiana at Baton Rouge there is a small train
fcolltinuously running through the expansive campus. No student has to
wait more than ten minutes at Louisiana until the campus train comes
and takes him to another _part of the campus. If similar bus service were
I-established from early morning till late at night, then University students
‘living in the hill top dorms would have little to complain about.

But at this point the administration has not indicated whether it
“would be willing to go to the expense of installing such transportation.
jvHo,wever it seems a necessity if students are expected to live in the upper
campus and then attend classes and study in the lower campus.

,Another Type of Grind

 
 
  
  
  
  
   
  
 
  
   
 
 
   
   
  
   
   
      
   
  

THERE ARE two types of
grind in this University. One
hits the books for six straight
"hours a night, perhaps tak-
ing a break on Saturday
night. The other is less schol-
arly, but in even more of a
rut. He slams his shoulder
against a tackling dummy
for four hours a night or
grinds out the same ﬁve
miles of cross-country every
afternoon. \

The ﬁrst grind -obviously
 wants his 3.5 to get into med
 school or to keep his schol-
' arship or to keep his father
happy; but why would any-
one .want to plod "around in
mid autumn mud in a foot-
. ball uniform or kicking a
 soccer ball or just plain run-
. ing?

 Is it just to keep an ath-
' letic scholarship? In some
cases, but what about the
. boy whose father makes a
.?S- very comfortable living and
could send his son to school
‘with no ﬁnancial aid from
the university? Or what
about the boy who isn’t on a
 scholarship and who may not
[ even be offered one? Every
 sport demands a form of
sacriﬁce, so there must be
an attraction that participa-
tion on an athletic team has
to make a boy pay the price.

. The Sporting Life

by Dan Lichtenstein

Often the attraction is more
than just a scholarship, and
it is usually more personal
and more substantial than
just the glory of wearing
sweat socks for dear old
Pitt. ~

FOR MANY athletes, the
quality will make them work
alld sacriﬁce is a simple mat-
ter of love for their sport
and knowing that they are
out there doing something
which very few other people
are doing. One athlete told
me of a late Friday after-
noon a fewyears ago. The
football team and everyone
else had left the Stadium.
The only sound in the dusk
was that of own his steps as
he jogged around the track.
The next day, literally thou-
sands of people would be
cheering, drinking and
watching a football game
where he was running. But
he was al-one that Friday,
the only student in the en-
tire University jogging that
track in the half-dark of late
afternoon.

It is just this sense, not of
being special or better than
anyone else, but just of be-
ing individual, knowing that
you are doing something no
one else is that keeps many

  
  
   
  
  
    
  
  
    
   
  
  
  
  

EDITOR'S NOTE

The Editorial Board of the
Pitt News would like to clari-
fy its reason for printing the
{Letter to the Editor, entitled
“Kofsky Decries Column on
_. Trent,” which appeared in the
 Nov. 7 edition.
’ The letter serves -as an ex-
_~ ample of the continuing be-

’ lief" of The Pitt News that the_
campus newspaper must be a
,_ forlim of free expression of
 student opinion‘. We will print
, any Letter to the Editor that

the Editorial Board does not
‘judge to be lewd or indecent.
At the same time the Editori-
al board wishes to -aﬁfirm the
fact that the more printing of a
letter does not indicate a be-
lief that there is any truth to
the contents. It is the judge-
ment of the Editorial Board
that in every instance Mr. Kaf-
sky's statements had absoulte-
ly no basis in fact. But because
they were his opinion, we felt
he had afrigh-t to have ‘them
printed.

  

   
     
  
    
  
  
 
  
 

Letters to the Editor must
carry the complete name, school
or address of the writer and
/must be typewritten and triple-
spaced. Pen names will be per-
mitted or names will be with-

.‘ bheld-at the discretion of the

good taste or fair play will be
rejected, and all letters are
subject to condensation. Let-
ters should be addressed to the

boys on athletic -teams. Per-

_haps this is the sort of iden-

tity that they say everyone
in a huge university is look-
ing for.

Almost any athlete will
tell you that sports are a
form of release. When home-
work and tests or any other
problems create a load on
your mind there are few
things more helpful than go-

ing and kicking blazes out .,

of a Soccer-.bau or tI;3<,~ing to  civil rights. But, the speech

knock the stuffing out of a
tackling dummy. And it is
no secret that daily practice
for any team will rarely hin-
der and often improve time
spent on homework. “It’s
the best thing to help you

budget your time,” said one '

member of the cross-country
team. When you know that
at least four hours a day
you’ll be out running in
Schenley Park or catching
a football until 8 p.m., you
know you have got to get the
work done”; There is no time
to goof off and be a collegi-
ate athlete.

THE‘ SITUATION is the
same for all extracurricular
activities. No one needs the
aggravation of being Stu-
dent Government president,
or even of being a senator.
It is ﬁne prestige to be an
editor of the Pitt News or
the president of a fraterni-
ty, but anyone out for just
the prestige will soon be dis-
appointed.

But if a.student wants to
work hard in something
other than homework, if he
wants self satisfaction in
knowing that he’s doing
something useful or if he
just wants to ﬁnd that fa-
mous identity we’re all sup-
posed to be looking, for, he
will ﬁnd it in representing
other students or in seeing
his article in the Pitt News
or just running alone in the

. clusk- some afternoon with a’ ."

A second problem that should be quickly clarified is that of cafe-

o teria provisions. The male students should not be forced to eat in a facili-

ity where no"w-omen residents will be allowed to eat. If dorms are built

on the hill then residents should have the option of eating either at the
Towers cafeteria or the proposed cafeteria on the hill.

King’s Visit

It has been pointed out in recent days that the housing of undergradu-
ates in the hill top dorms would only be temporary. As soon as they could
be relocated on lower campus housing, the new dorms would be used for
students who attend classes in the Health Complex (which is close to the
proposed site). No one. can deny the administration that housing is one of
Pitt’s biggest headaches and there is an emergency need for residence halls.

‘ It is our feeling that student opinion would not object to undergraduate
housing on the hill, if it is just to meet a momentary crisis.

The most unfortunate part of the entire situation is that the an-
nouncement came of the proposed locations with little explanation of any
of the possible accommodations the University administration now has in
mind. When radical changes in course of student life are announced in
the future rejoiners will hopefully be included which not only explicate
but also soften the blow. V

i What Did It Mean?

THE SMOULDERING,
limited conﬁict surrounding
the recent Visit of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King has prob-
ably served to obscure King’s
actions and words them-
selves. This, along with a
“I’ve heard it allbefore” at-
titude may indeed lead one
to neglect altogether the
speech and statements of the
civil rights leader.‘

It is true that King’s
“pitch” here seemed to hold
no new ideas; nor did it
make any dynamic announce-
ments of new directions in

can be used as a guide to the
new emphasis —of the civil
rights movement. King’s
statements also serve to
show why he has been such
a consistently powerful lead-
er in civil rights.

The “new emphasis in civ-
il rights” is probably not
new to a conscientious ob-
server ofthe movement.
However, to a public inform-
ed only by newspaper head-
lines and television an-
nouncements, the demand
for equality in economic op-
portunity, especially in hous-
ing, is new. Until last year,
John Citizen (white) -has
heard about Negroes want-
ing the right to vote or to

- eat or sleep in public accom-

modations. These things are
easily associated with the
“American Ideal” so that the

degree of stiff, outspoken op--

position to equality in these
areas was not insurmount-
able. \ ’

AS KING said, however,
the move for equal housing
IS a step in a new direction
and one which is going to
“cost something.” The bitter
struggle ahead for Negroes

has been previewed by the’ A

failure of the Civil Rights
Housing Bill to get throgh
Congress last month. Per-
haps the answer for Negroes
seeking a solution to econom-
ic inequity may be the War
on Poverty. King recognizes
this. “It would be a shame to
spend $24 billion for the war
in Vietnam and not spend
just as much in the War on
Poverty,” said King. Even if
the money is spent, it may
take several decades before
equal housing and general
opportunity are attained.
King recognizes this, too.
Here is where his state-
ments showed one reason
why King has been the civil
rights leader since 1954.
King is a common-sense,

practical man who has had -

the genius for perserverance
needed to work effectively at
a great challenge. King also
has a sense for public rela-
tions that told him that the
adoption of a “militantly
non-violent” stand was the
only way to make progress
against the inertia of a con-
servative, white society.

This same sense gave King
the ability to see the prob-
lem of semantics when using
the term “Black Power.” He
had to explain to younger
advocates of civil rights that
this term is conotative of
Black Supremacy, and, as
such, is poorly chosen des-
cription of the civil rights
"movement.

KING’S METHODS have
recently led to signiﬁcant
progress in housing for Ne-
groes in the Chicago area.
In that same city, the “mili-
tantly violent” cause only
reactions of distrust among
the Whites. If it is true, as
I have heard more than one
Negro content, that the aims
of Dr. King are identical
with those of Stockely Car-
michael, it can only be his
methods that have made
King the acknowledged
spokesman of black people in
the United States.

All of these things were
overtones of King’s visit. A
“Mustang vs, Limousine”
conﬁict should not be used
by Negroes. to overshadow
King’s message of perserver-
ance and non-violence. Nor
should the conﬁict be used
by whites as a screen to cov-
er the Negro demands for
equality of economic. oppor-

Student Analyzes
Kofsky’s Letter

Editor, The Pitt News: ,
After reading Alan Disler’s
“Study in Demagogy” and Frank
Kofsky’s attack on it, I can't
help butlfeel that Mr. Kofsky is
using the same journalistic tech.-
niques he accuses Mr. Disler of
using. Without condemning or
supporting either side of the King

issue, I cite the following faults '

in Mr. Kofsky’s reasoning.

1) He castigates the” Dean of
Student Affairs‘ Office without
ever proving its relationship to
Mr. Disler or his article. As proof

of this relationship he makes the -

erroneous statement that the
Dean edits the newspaper, which
even if true (which it isn’t) does-
n’t mean that she put Mr. Dis-

ler’s name to her own article, or.

even favors his point of view.
2) Mr. Kofsky claims that the
University administration and
the Student Government are sy-
nonamous. Even is this is actual-
ly true, the interesting anecdote
about Eric Stern doesn’t prove it.
A bold accusation such as this
requires a detailed investigation,
not a summary ‘proof based on a
small bit of What may be hear-
say. Furthermore, Mr. Kofsky
has yet to show, that this sup-
posed Administration control ﬁlt-
ers down to the level of trans-
portation for SUB guests. '
3) Mr. Kofsky bases his belief
in" University discrimination on
the fact that a Negro musician.
was not picked up at the bus
station. It seems to me that a
mistake like that is hardly suf-
ficient for such..a generalization.

..Since there are Negro athletes

on Pitt’s teams, Negro scholar-
ship students, Negroes in student
activities (some in responsible
positions), and Negro employees
of the University, how can one

case suffice for such an accusa-

tion. - ‘
4) Mr. Kofsky accuses Mr. Dis-

ler of McCarthyism. He claims

that Mr. Disler is lumping many
students into the same category
as that great American bogey-

man, communism. This may be

true, however I think lVIr. Kof-
skly has done the same thing.
His terrible ogre is the Dean of
Student Affairs, in whose clutch-
es he places Student Government,
the SUB, The Pitt News, and Mr_
Disler. He hasn’t proved’ that

_these people are controlled by

the Student Affairs Office, or that
that office is really of the nature
he claims it is. He infers that
the whole authority in Student

V Affairs is submerged in radical

reactionary anti-“Liberal Ameri-
can” horror.

I_won’t claim that either Mr.
Kofsky’es or Mr. Disler’s View-

, points are right or wrong. I think

we should learn a few morepfacts

before deciding. '

fTweedleDum&Dee’

V Editor, The Pitt News:
J’ The Pitt News editorial of Nov.
 7, entitled “Shapp’s Progressive
CPlans,” leaves one with the im-
-pression that sanity will reappear-
in state programs (and more par-
' "ticulalarly the educational pro-
grams), if Pennsylvanians are
‘ wise enough to elect Milton
' Shapp, the Democratic candidate
for governor. Fortunately there
is another alternative, whose fea-
srsibility may be seen in light of
the following hypothetical de-
sign: Let us suppose that Milton
‘ ‘Shapp is Tweedle-Dum.
- vThen we must postulate that
‘Republican candidate Shafer is
Tweedle-Dee. We assume the gen-
. eric term “Tweedle” because
both candidates approach prob-
lems with the very same anti-
_ quated tool. (“Tweedle” has no-
- ‘necessary connection in this case
with Old Boss Tweed, whom you
will will remeinber was the in-
evitable outgrowth of a particu-
lar type of socio-economic sys-
tem). To continue, if Tweedle-
-‘Dum equals Tweedle-Dee, then
this basic identity should have
us concluding that there is really
only a one-party system in this
state.
And indeed, if. we concluded
\ this, we would not be far astray
of the facts. Over the many years
of Pennsylvania’s proud history,
she has continued to be plagued
by the same basic problems: un-
’ employment, poor or inadequate
educational facilities, pollution of
land, air and waterways, wages
that give the worker only a frac-
tion of his producing power,
slums, deplorable medical facil-

elderly . . . the list goes on and

The Tweedle-Dums and the
Tweedle-Dees have shaken their
brilliant bunting at these inde-
fatigable evils; pretty girls in
leotards have passed out cam-
paign buttons — politicians have
spoken of them with ample ver-
bosity, poverty programs have
and the general
population has become anaesthe-
tized with government handouts
and Ajax-clean Reform Measures.
But sadly enough, the Tweedle-
Dums and the Tweedle-Dees have
not been able to exercise the
evils. ‘It seems that their anti-
quated tool, the “Capitalistic Il-
lusion,” is no longer an able ser-
vant to its masters. Rather, it
perpetuates an endless fumbling
which makes it quite incapable
as an instrument to anything but
despair.

However, let us not despair!
For there is room in our hypo-
thetical design for a reasonable
man. He comes in the person of
George S. Taylor, the Socialist
Labor Party’s gubenatorial candi-
date. Mr. Taylor is not plagued
by the inoperative‘ “Capitalistic
Illusion.” Rather, he is equipped
with the facilitative device, the
“Socialist Alternative.” Surpris-
ingly enough, this device is dev-_
astatingly effective in emulsify-
ing the. supposedly immutable
evils. It is not an Cidealistic ma-
chine, but rather a practical one,
based on sound econmoics, and
a full understanding of human
nature. But alas! The facilitative
device will -only start if it re-
ceives the proper fuel-ejection
(votes) from an enlightened elec-
torate. So we see, hypothetically‘
(and may I propose, practically),
there is an alternative to Twee-
dle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee.

Trent Criticizes
Dis1er’s Column

Editor, The Pitt News:

Although I have been strongly
encouraged to ignore the reac-
tlonary attack of a Pitt News
column signed by an Alan Disler,
I think that it would be amiss
of me to fail to identify the true
source of these slanderous alle-
gations.- ,

Anyone who reads the article
immediately realized that Disler
was speaking as the chairman of
the Society for Conservative
Studies, ‘a campus organization
with three active members. Dis-
ler’s blatant and biased asser-
tions served as\ a means of pro-
claiming his conservative group
as the campus function of the
John Birch Socity.

Surely, he didn't think that he
could mar_ (sic) the reputation of
an organization like the Hill Ed-
ucation Project whose work has
been praised by Chancellor’s
(sic) Litchﬁeld, Crawford and
Kurtzman. I ﬁnd it hard to be-
lieve that the chairman of the
Society for Conservative Studies
would be so naive as to think
that Negro students on campus
have a sympathetic ear for his
propaganda. Finally, judging from
the total membership of the So-
ciety for Conservative Studies, it

"doesn't appear that white stu-

dentslhave or will pay him much
attention.

What is signiﬁcant is that Dis-

Imaginary models are similar
to theoretical models as they are
concerned with ideas rather than
p h ys i c a 1 representations. They
differ, however in that the ver-
bal models given do not have to
have any ‘‘real analogues” in
the physical world. Achinstein
stated, “There is no requirement
that electric lines of force actual-
ly exist. It is enough that by us-
ing this concept we are able to
more easily understand the phe-
nomenon of electricity.”

Achinstei.n criticized the cur-
rent semantic theory of models
that a scientist can make serious
mistakes when generalizing from
his model if he does not know
what kind of model it is. “If you

really think that there are lines
of force somewhere,” said Achin-
stein, “you are seriously wrong.
The only way to avoid these er-
rors is to keep in mind exactly
what kind of model is being em-
ployed.”i

Off - Campus Housing
GainsStudent Support

CLEMSON, S. C. — (IP) —The
increasing desire for “off-campus
living” by Clemson University
students is receiving careful ad-
ministrative attention here. “For
many students, off-campus living
is here to stay,” says Vice-Presi-
dent for Student Affairs Walter
T. Cox.

“There are many reasons why
students seek off-campus living,"
he said, “including the principal
one given by most students that
study conditions are quieter and
better. A prime contributing fac-
tor to the search for off-campus
housing,” Cox added, “is Clem-

«son's increasing graduate school

enrollment.
“Graduate students by their

Exhibits

Sculpture

An exhibition of the new sculp-

ture by Virgil D. Cantini, profes-
sor in the Henry Clay Frick Fine
Arts Department of the Univer-
sity, is currently showing at the
King-Center, 125] North Negley
Ave. The exhibition will run
through Nov. 16.

Prof. Cantini has been working
in the development of enamel
on metal, for which he has re-
ceived local and national recog-
nition. He has also worked in

A welded metal sculpture.

In 1953, Cantini was named as
one of the “Hundred Leaders of
Tomorrow” by Time Magazine,
and in 1955 was named the News-
paper “Man of the Year.” The
Arts and Crafts Center of Pitts-
burgh also awarded him “Artist
of the Year in 1956.”

His work has been shown in

_ the Sculpture Section of the 1958

and 1964 International Art Ex-
hibition at Carnegie Museum and
is in many churches in the tri-
state area, private collections and
the permanent collection at Car-
negie Museum.

very nature and educational com-
mitment search for living accom-
modations with a minimum of
distractions and maximum of
good study conditions. Most grad-
uate students seek privacy and
freedom of activity that off-cam-
pus housing offers.”

Clemson's climbing enrollment
and the amount of off-campus
living that goes with it has
prompted the private construc-
tion of eight or ten small apart-
ment buildings here in the last
two years.

“The factor of off-campus liv-
ing is one with which colleges

and universities all across the_

land are having to deal,” Cox
said. “Here, as on virtually every
other campus in the land, some
students will always insist upon
living in non-university accom-
modations.” -

The number of such students
is increasing, he said, but the
percentage of those seeking off-
campus living in proportion to
the total student body is decreas-
ing. Activity in this area has be-
come so constant that Clemson
has established an office of “off-
campus living” as a part of the
dean of men’s office.

Another Day I

Personality, Not Skill
Rules College Football

By Tom Sacks
SportsEditor

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

It might come as a shock to Dale Carnegie, but for
years he has been directing his personality and confidence
courses in the wrong direction—the world of business. For
the world of business isino longer -of primary interest to
the American public. The world of football instead has re-
placed business as the dominant concern in the minds of the
average American and this interest has made the job of
coaching football one of the most hazardous in the country.

These hazards of student and faculty interest, combined
with the pressure of alumni, have contributed to an ever
mounting casualty rate among college football coaches, espe-
cially.

There is no simple formula toward success for the aspir-
ing football coach, but in college ball it_has become evident
that what occurs during the off season is much more im-
portant than the actual fall action;

It is estimated that recruiting now consumes 80 per-
cent of a coaches time, with the actual mapping of game
strategy commanding the remaining 20 percent.

Bill Neal, defensive coach for the Panthers, says that
he sees less of his family during the recruiting period than

‘during the regular football season. ~

What this all adds up to is that no longer is skill the
primary requisite for a college coach. Instead, what will
probably make or break him in the long run is his person-
ality. -

For this reason alone the football program. at Pitt will '

be on the upswing during the next several years for Dave
Hart is a salesman and a good one at that. Whether or not
Hart is a better than average "coach would be difficult _to
discover, but it has been proven that he -is a better than
average recruiter. And once you get the horses even the
fair coachgcan’t help but be successful. _

Currently Hart and his staff are committed to roughly
25 high school seniors. How many of these that they will
sign only time can tell, but those 25 are the best that West-
ern Pennsylvania has to offer. Ara Parseghian told Hart
before last Saturday’s game that his staff is also seeking
everyone of those boys. T

The top boy on that list is Lloyd Weston of Pi.ttsburgh’s
Westinghouse High School. Coach Dick Bestwick, who has
been watching Weston, considers ‘him “the finest high school
lineman I’ve ever seen.” As Hart said, “If we can land
Weston, we’ll definitely be on our way.” ‘

This interest in Weston is unique for in the past Pitt
has demonstrated on ineptness in its interest and ability
to recruit the Negro athlete. At the same time Pitt coaches
demonstrated a remarkable ability in alienating Pete Dim-
perio, the Westinghouse coach. This year Harthasa made

» .. sure that Dimperio should not be-given the same feeling.

Hart and his staff know what they’re doing when they
recruit. They know how to be sincere and they realize when
flattery is called for. They arrange television coverage when
a boy decides to sign and are sure that the local papers rec-
ognize each signing. Part of their recruiting utensils are
flowers and candy for the parents. _

Hart was fairly successful last year. The Naponiks
and McCains could start right now. But until Hart brings
in another good class this year, he will be running scared
because of the current dismal Panther season. He realizes,
though, that this winter his personality will either make or
break his future as a head coach.

taker was one of the main reasons for the good

by GEORGE LIES -

Mineral Ridge in Ohio is a place where the
hard cider ﬂows and the ﬁddles play at gradua-
tions and weddings. It’s a small village and could
be compared to something from A1 Capp, but its
high school football team bred a tackle who made
the Big Time.

Ed Whittaker is his name, but call him “E-Z”
‘for short? It’s a nickname given him by his father,
who was sort of surprised when his little boy
grew up‘/to be six-foot-three inches and 220 pounds.

The nickname comes from the initials of his
ﬁrst name Ed and his middle name Zale. His father
followed the exploits of the boxer Tony Zale, who
was a champion in his weight class, and so the
initial “E-Z.” ' _ -

The players kid him about the nickname and
also about his hometown. They kid him on trips,
especially when “E-Z” sees Something for the ﬁrst
time. _

“I never saw Playboy magazine until I came
here,” said Ed, “and the guys always kid me when
we see tall buildings. They ask if Mineral Ridge
has them.” , ’

As a freshman last year, Ed probably would
have found more action in Mineral Ridge than he
did playing football. He was one of the 16 recruits
which coach Dave Hart inherited.

“I really didn't understand the situation,” Ed
said in a very serious tone. “Last year really hurt.
You would go up there and not do anything.”

Maybe that’s why he was nervous in his ﬁrst

game in a year, but he started at offensive left

game against UCLA. It was his ﬁrst organized ‘

tackle proving right the coaches who selected him i

All-State in high school. -

“I was tighter than a drum out there and I— 

would always be running in the opposite direction‘
to everyone else,” said Ed. He was until offensive
line coach Jim Royer came up and shook his hand.
“Keep you rear end lose,’ that’s what he said,”
Ed said. ‘ ‘
Royer does more than just try to keep the play-
ers loose. “His only gripe all the time is over the

little ﬁnesse points of blocking. ‘Those things make 

a good blocker,’ he says,” continued Ed.
Blocking is Ed’s mainstay, but once this season,

he was called upon to catch a pass on a tackle:— 

eligible pattern. “We worked on that play a week
before the Syracuse game, but I thought it was a
gimmick to keep interest going in practice.

“It was my one chance to catch a pass and
when they called it all I could think about was
catching it.” He caught the pass but a penalty
nulliﬁed his reception.

Frustrated perhaps in a season which ‘appears 

doomed, Ed found there was more to offensive

blocking than just carrying out an assignment. He

contributes this science-angle to Dave Hart.
“Coach Harts knows exactly what blocking play

is needed for any situation,” Ed said. “He is the B‘ 
reason our pass protection has been real good.’

He knows how to scatter block the defenders.”

Blocking is a challenge to “EZ” Ed because ff

he wants to outwit that defender and hit him hard-
er that next time. In his eyes there is future hope

‘ and maybe next year there will be a recruit from

Dogpatch to help him. ~

Confidence Restored

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was a dreary rainy day on
“Flagstaff Hill” in Schenley Park
and as usual the ﬁve man cross-
country team coached by Jim Ban-
ner was hard at work, preparing
for the next and ﬁnal meeting.

Junior Paul Greig, who has
been running under the shadows
of seniors Frank Handelman,
Fran Shor, and Larry Hubner,
was as usual listening to the in-
structions of coach Banner. Greig
has come a long way since his
high school days in Lockport,
N. Y. Even though he won the
Western New York cross-country
run two years in a row and was
undefeated in every meet he ran
while in high school, he was
quickly disillusioned by a num-
ber of factors when he entered
this University three years ago.
Following .a ,rat__h,e_1j dismal. ea

  

son last year, Greig has come
back under Banner to be an ex-
tremely optimistic and spirited
member of the harriers. ,

Last week, against Penn State,
Greig posted a time of 22:31,
which bettered by more than two
minutes his time at the beginning
of the season. Greig said, “The
reason for my improvement is
coach Banner’s ability to get the
best possible time from me. He

has restored my self-conﬁdence‘

which is one of the most impor-
tant aspects of being a successful
distance runner.”

Greig feels that Banner has done
a tremendous job with the team
as a whole. “Coach Banner knows
just how to apply the psychology
of distance running.” Greig’s
praise for Banner went on and
o “Baf£n’er‘_- __ a ‘”r‘ea

7 o ‘B B Cubs End Grid Season
Paul Greig Keeps Harriers Gomg

everything he does and it seems
to have worked.”

Banner in return said, “Greig
has done a tremendous job all
season. He has never let me down
and he has rebuilt his conﬁdence
which is most important in this
sport. I hope he can run under
22 minutes next season.

Greig loves cross-country, feel-
ing it to be a great conditioning
sport. I am very optimistic for

Panther Basketball Team Begins

COACH BOB TIMMONS kneels in front of a possible starting ﬁve.
They include Stan Falenski, Tony DeLisio, Jim LaValley (kneeling)
and Ken Bollens and Sylvester Stevenson (standing).

Panther Stats
Reveal Little

With only two games remain-
ing in the season, the Panthers’
statistics to date won’t be at-
tracting that many raves.

The Panthers have yielded 240
points while only scoring 68 of
their own. On the ground they
have gained 698 yards with Mike
Raklewicz responsible for 298 on
88 carries and Joe Jones, 295 on
84 carries.

The passing game, which has
stalled the past two games with
Ed James injured, has accounted
f01‘ 1.051 net yards. Bob Longo
remains the primary receiver

with 482 yards on 35 receptions.

Bench Strength Buoys
Hopes for Better Year

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
Optimism reigns before every basketball season. The
team’s shooters never seem to miss those 15 foot Jump

shots, the rebounders control both backboards, the ball han-
dlers set up plays that actually work, and even desperation heaves
somehow ﬁnd the basket at the buzzer.

Panther basketball is no exception. After last season’s team
scrambled to a 5-17 ﬁnish, anyone who isn’t more conﬁdent about
this year’s edition has a mighty dismal winter ahead of him.

Actually coach Bob Timmons says, “We’re much better overall
than the past two years.” And remember that three seasons ago, the
basketball team played in the NIT,

What transpired since has chieﬂy been the fault of an unreliable
bench. Opposing teams would rest their starters and send in capable
substitutes while Timmons could do little but pray that his starters
\wouldn’t get hurt or tired.

This year promises to be different. Timmons has reserves he
Won’t be hesitant to throw into a ball game. In fact Timmons feels
he can call on at least ten ballplayers, virtually a 100 per cent increase
over last year. V

Currently on the second-string am sophs Sylvester Stevenson
and Al DeFrishi-.1 up front, with sophomore Tim Fisher and senior
Pete Smith at the guards, and junior Bob Thompson in the pivot.

“All ten will play a lot,” Timmons says. “With this depth, we’ll
be able to speed up our attack. We’ll use a fast break offense from a
pressuring defense.”

Timmons is aware that five of the basketball players he’s count-
ing on are sophomores and that sophomores make mistakes. “I’m hop-
ing that Falenski and the other more experienced players will set the
pace,” he says. “The sophomores will come along.”

As freshmen last year they compiled a 12-5 record, the best frosh
season since the 1960 crop that went to the NIT as seniors. Kalata
(6-4) and Stevenson (6-3). were the leading scorers on a team that
usually presented a diversiﬁed scoring attack.

Of course, Timmons is hoping that his talented sophs can plug
the two positions vacated by last season’s co-captains Larry Szykowny
and Bob Lovett, the only two starters to graduate.

“The kids are working hard,” he explains. “The competition for
positions means that they can’t loaf out there. They know somebody
is pushing them for starting berths all the time.”

Since the ::Cl1e:.lule is about the same as last year, with the ex-
ception of a tougher Christmas tournament in Raleigh against N. C.
State, South Carolina and Air Force, Timmons feels that his “better
shooting” ball club will hold its

OWII.

It still, however, has the chron-
ic height disadvantage. “We need
a scoring and rebounding center,”
Timmons admits. “If we had one,
we’d be a pretty fair ball clu .”

As it is, LaValley (6-6) ﬁgures
to improve in both those depart-
ments as he starts his third year
of college ball. He’d better. The
cagersi need strong rebounding to
establish their fast break.

The pre-season optimism will
be tested three weeks from to-
morrow when the Panthers en-
tertain Carnegie Tech in the sea-
-son’s opener. Hopefully for Pan-
ther basketball that
won’t fade.

3 Bemis Makes Use of Film



 

Booter Defense Upsets kron

by MIKE BROURMAN

For 16 minutes of last Saturday’s soc-
cer game, the Akron bench was conﬁdent.
For the next hour they were hopeful. In the
last quarter they were desperate. They were wit-
nessing what most of ‘them couldn't believe. They
were watching the booters shut them out 1-0 at
Forbes Field.

Gary Fcertsch wiped the conﬁdent look off the
Akron faces after 16 minutes of the ﬁrst period
when he took a pass from Blaine Popp and drilled
a lower liner past the Akron goalie and into the
net.

The booter defense stymied Akron’s hopes for
the the rest of the game. Led by center fullback
Jim Snyder and goalie Lou Cepanec, they turned
aside every threat in handling Akron only their
second loss of the season against nine wins.

With three minutes left in the game, one of
the Akron players began muttering, “We can’t
lose this game. ,We’ve only lost to Michigan State.
We can’t lose to Pitt.” But the booters’ defense
was as unpenetrable in those last three minutes
as it was in theﬁrst 85.

Meanwhile, coach Leo Bemis has added an-
other innovation to the team. Last Saturday a
movie camera captured much of the game, and
Bemis and his assistants spent Sunday looking over
the ﬁlms.

“IT thought we looked pretty good on the ﬁlms,
especially our defense,” said Bemis. “The line play
was alright but it still needs some work. We should
have won 3-0. Early in the game Bob Racunas was
wide open, but nobody saw him. The same thing
happened in the fourth quarter.”

Bemis hopes his linemen have better vision this
Saturday against Bucknell. The Bisons extended
the soccer team last year, and Bemis expects them
to be improved this time around. -

Hawks Rout
Owls, 6-0 in
Toilet Bowl

The Pitt News Hawks main-
tained their undefeated and un-
tied record last Sunday when
they routed the Owl Owls, 6-0._
This victory in the annual Toilet
Bowl was extra sweet for the
Hawks, who were determined to

revenge last year’s 20-0 defeat.

The main reason for the. differ-
ence in scores was the absence
of Frank Smizik, whose presence
last year was a deﬁnite handicap.

The Hawks were so unmerciful
in this year’s beating, they even
decided to extend the game into
an overtime period. About all
they couldn't accomplish in four
regular periods of play was score.

And the biggest obstacle in the
path was their huddles. It was
estimated that each huddle last-
ed roughly ﬁve minutes, but the
Hawks felt it was a necessity to
type out a play-by-play in each
huddle.

It had been predicted that Tom
“Alabama” Sacks was the man
to watch and he deﬁnitely was
as he dropped two passes in the
end zone. For his efforts “Ala-
bama” was awarded the game
ball which had been stolen in
the ﬁrst place.

Mike Brourman was awarded
the Sam Huff fair ‘play award
for hitting Roy Jacobs in the
mouth while cheering on the
sidelines. Andy Swartz won the
can of molasses for his ability to

slow up the game on punt re-»

could see the ball around 6
o’clock. But four and a half min-
utes still remain to be played as
the Panzers lead by a point most- -
ly through the efforts of quar-
terback Tom Beckett.

So far Beckett has scored 14
points on runs and passed for
six more to Bob Petrillo. It is
now up to his defense to hold the
Lions for the remaining minutes.

The Phi Ep offense never got
moving and although the Delts .
had good drives going all after-
noon, they always muffed it when
they got near the end zone. The
losers’ best play, a halfback op-
tion pass, worked until Sandy
Warren picked off a pass and re-
turned it for the onlytouchdown.
