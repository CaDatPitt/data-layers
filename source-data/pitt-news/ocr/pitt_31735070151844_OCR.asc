STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Deadline
extension
meets mixed

reviews ”  

Danielle Fox
Staﬂ" Writer

During most electoral contests, candidates
drop out one by oneover time, but the Stu-
dent. Government Board is asking more
students to enter the race for its upcoming
election. ’ -

Nine students submitted campaign-

applicationsby the original deadline on
Oct. 23 — half the number of last year’s
applicants. To give voters more options,
Aaron Gish, Elections Committee chair-
man, extended the deadline to submit ap-
plications to Nov. 2. V t i '

The Elections Code grants Gish the
power to do what is necessary to facilitate
an efﬁcient election if there are no speciﬁc

. sections of the code that apply to situations

that arise during the process.

Two additional students submitted ap-
plications for'Board positions under the
extension, bringing the total numbertof
candidates to 11_. There were no additional
applicants for president of the Board, and
current Board member Mike N ites is the
only candidate running for Board presi-
dent. ‘ »

One Pitt student has combined traditional
campaign rhetoric with a You'I‘ube video and
‘ millennial vernacular to ask Pittsburghers for
write"-invotes. g

, “Four one two, I stand with you,” Scott
Sauter says in his video as he stands in front
of a map of Pennsylvania.

V Sauter, a senior history major at Pitt with
plans to eventually attend law school, is an

. independent write—in candidate running for

mayor of Pittsburgh. According to Sauter,
he decided to run to represent the college
students and service industry workers of the
Pittsburgh area, who he said are underrepre-
sented by current politicians. '
“This town has so many students and yet
so fewpolicies that directly beneﬁt us,” Sauter

Sauter said that while the “odds are

have the potential to inspire other young
people to take part in political elections.

His campaign posters boast that he is run-

ﬁnancial aid from paying city taxes regardless
of whether or not the students’ parents still
claim them as dependents.

Sauter said that although many students
come from middle-class families, it is unusual
to ﬁnd a student whose parents pay for their
schooling. , ..

“T-his hard fact forces myself and many, pp
many fellowlstudentsof mine to take out loans A

with grotesquely high interest rates, work
while in school to pay rent, live below the
poverty line and yet somehow still have our in-
come taxed at nearlyzo percent,” Sauter said.

Sauter plans to work with the Pittsburgh
Department of Finance, the Pittsburgh City
Council and University Financial Oﬂicials to
ensure that all Pitt students‘ who qualify for
ﬁnancial aid receive tax exemptions. He said
the exemption would beneﬁt the Pittsburgh

’ economyaswellbecause studentswouldhave

more money to spend on local businesses.

Additionally, Sauter said he would use
his position as mayor to address the lack of
grocery stores in many Pittsburgh neighbor-
hoods, which he called “food deserts.”

He described a food desert as a ‘neigh-
borhood withoutanaccessible grocery store
within a two-mile radius. 

Sauter said he wantsto see. more

the availability of healthy food in Pittsburgh
neighborhoods. He also said this wouldboost
local food production and reward systems for

Although he may not have as much po-

litical experience as some of his opponents, ‘

Sauter said he has always “sought the ‘advice

The campaign team operates without

Michael Goodhart, a political science
professor at Pitt, said that while candidates
can “mobilize” voters through social media,
the shift in campaign methods isn’t really

_ transforming the election process.

According to Goodhart, social media such

turnout only slightly, so by themselves they

"won’t change the political process.

Gish said students still have the option‘ to
apply for late presidency.

The code includes provisions for people
-to apply for late candidacy, whereby people
can nominate themselves after the dead?
line, up until one week before the election.

To apply late for the presidency, candi-
dates must turn in a petition with 500 sig-
natures and write a statement of less than
500 words explaining his or her reason
for applying late. Late Board candidates
must turn in a petition with 400 signa-
tures,.instead of 200, as is required in the
ﬁrst round of applications, and also turn in
the statement required of late presidential

’candidates.

Some students who have already entered

.the SHGB race disagree with Gish’s strategy

to increase the number of candidates.

Lauren Barney, a candidate for the
Board, said that Gish should have required
students to apply as late candidates and not
have extended the deadline.

“It shows that [the late candidates] are
actually dedicated, and the Board is moni-
toring their dedication and quality of the
candidate,” Barney said.

Barney said the situation was mishan-
dled because there is already a section of

the code that allows additional candidates

to run. _ .

i ,“I have no problem with making it easier
for people to get on the ballot,” Barney
said. “I want to make sure another opinion-
on this subject is heard. There is a huge
structural problem there.”

Barney said thatshe loves that the de—,

cision was made with the student body in
mind, but also said that she does not agree
with how the committee is “negating the
fact that there is an installed system.” Gish
said that members of his committee and
the Board believe that the relatively small
number of prospective candidates in this
year’s election constitutes an extenuating
circumstance and that they should do ev-
erything within their power to prevent an
uncontested election. . .

“Although this wasn’t technically break-
ing the rules, I can understand people’s con-
cerns,” Gish said. “I’m driven by the rules
in the code, but I can see the larger image.”

  Change

in NYC’   legal smoking

age not likelyto enact real change

Sophia Al Rasheed
Columizist

It was announced last week that
New York City will raise the n1ini- .
mum age for purchasing cigarettes
to 21 through a bill titled Tobacco
21, proposed by the City Council
in hopes of reducing the number.
of people who become addicted»
to thisform of tobacco.

“This is literally legislation that
will save lives,” said City Council
Speaker Christine C. Quinn in
New York Times article last week;

Increasing taxes on cigarettes?
has already lowered the incentive
for adolescents to purchase them.
And raising the legal purchasing
age for cigarettes would further
reduce the damage. The argu-
ment in place stilldances around

the main cure for cigarette addic-
tion —— omitting additives such as
nicotine that increase the likeli-
hood that the ﬁrst pack isn’t the
last. If government officials truly
cared about this issue," despite the
revenue of this lucrative business,
this is where they should start.
The passage of this bill is just
one of several tactics that will be
adopted to lower the amount of
cigarette purchases in the country.
The New YorkTimes article also
mentions that there will be “in-
creased penalties for retailers who

evade tobacco taxes, prohibition of

discounts for tobacco products and
aminimum price of $10.50 apack
for cigarettes and little cigars,” in
order to discourage purchases.

“I don’t think that’s going to

.wor ,” said 16-year-old Nicole
Spencer in the aforementioned
article. Spencer pointed out that
she has been smoking since she
was 13 and never had trouble find-
ing cigarettes.

Other arguments, similar to
those that criticize the legal drink-
ing age, relate to the opinion that
18 is old enough to make your own
decisions on such matters. a

“If at the age of 18 we can ﬁght
for our country and potentially die,
we should at least be able to have
a cigarette before we do it,” said
Sam Adler, a senior at Wagner Col-
lege on Staten Island. Adler wasn’t
alone in his opinion, as opponents
to thebill brought thisup in the ar-

cigarettes remain a highly addicting, highly

smoking are well—recognized, and cigarette
purchases remain steady, proving that ef-
forts thus far have been unsuccessﬁil. De-

people can choose for themselves whether
they want to partake in the habit, are more

The initial choice to smoke a cigarette is
obviously up to the individual, but the crav-

a cigarette in hand. Asidegfrom thestigma
we attach to smokers, there’s little we can

Privileging those above the age of 21 in
New York City to the regulated, toxic sticks,
and deeming those from the ages of 18 to 20
simply unable to make this decision, despite
the other duties they’re deemed responsible
enough to carry, only seems to insult the

Pitt makes

statement, _
improvement
in exhibition

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team’s ﬁrst ex-
hibition matchup against University of
California San Diego left much to be de-

sired from the Panthers. Friday night at .

the Petersen Events Center, fans likely left
a little more satisﬁed, as Pitt levied a 96-60
beatdown on Slippery Rock.

The theme of the week for Pitt, as en-
acted by head coach Jamie Dixon, .was
improvement. In a tangible sense, the
36-point win, compared to last week’s
13-point margin, showed just that.

“_I think we obviously accomplished
that,” Dixon said. “I think we had a lineup
that we’d been practicing with out there
most of the time, so that was good. We
improved defensively on our patience more
than anything, patience and understand-
ing.”

The defense allowed one more point to
the Rock than it did to the Tritons, but held
Slippery Rock to 33.9 percent shooting on
19—of—56 attempts. SRU made just 7-of—27
shots in the ﬁrst half as Pitt opened up a
39-20 halftime lead.

Pitt burst out of the break to start the

"second. When the Rock ﬁnally hit the

39-point threshold Pitt passed after one
half, the Panthers led 72-39.

‘Durand Johnson led the Panthers in
scoring Friday, with 21 points on 7-of-13

’ shooting in 22 minutes off the bench.John-

son led the reserves in minutes played,
and his 13 attempts from the ﬁeld marked
a team high. "

On a clear Saturdaynight the Pitt Pan-
thers fell by a score of 21-10 to the Geor—.
gia Tech Yellow Jackets, due in large

-part to another lackluster performance

offensively.

The Panthers collected just 17 first
downs in the game and failed to pick up
a first down on seven of their 11 drives.

“Give Georgia Tech credit. Obviously
they made big plays to win the game,”
head coach Paul Chryst said after the
game. “I’m truly proud that our kids put
themselves out there, but the bottom

_line is there are plays to be made when

the game matters, and tonight I don’t
think we made enough, while [Georgia]
Tech certainlydid.”

In the first half of Saturday eve-
ning’s game, Pitt’s offense (4-4, 2-3
ACC) seemed to struggle against a stout
Georgia Tech (6-3, 5-2 ACC) defensive
line, as the Panthers failed to record
a first down in the first quarter. As a

result, the Panthers faced a 7-0 deficit
at the end of the first quarter.

After failing to produce any offensive
success in the game’s opening quar-

'ter, the Panthers broke through in the

second quarter on a 44-yard field goal
by freshman kicker Chris Blewitt. The
successful attempt cut Georgia Tech’s
_lead to 7-3. j

The YellowJackets answered with a
touchdown, as Robert Godhighy took a
pitch to the outside for 35 yards and a
touchdown. Godhigh’s scoring scramble
capped a seven-play, 77-yard drive.

Pitt entered halftime down 14-3,
allowing Georgia Tech to amass 196
yards in the first half. Out of the break,
Pitt allowedjust 50 yards to the Yellow
Jackets in the third quarter.

“We made more interior adjustments
at halftime, while on the edges we were
pretty much the same,” senior corner-
back K’waun Williams said.

Meanwhile, Pitt pulled within four
points of the YellowJackets as the third

quarter ended. Led by freshman re-
ceiver Tyler Boyd, Pit_:t’s first drive _of
the third went 66 yards over six plays.

The final play of the drive was a

’ 12;yard back-shoulder fade pass from

quarterback Torn Savage to Boyd in the
left corner of the end zone that resulted
in a touchdown. Boyd followedhis per-
formance against Navy with another
good one Saturday, recording 11 catches
for 118 yards and one score.

“Everyone kind of linked together in
that moment,” Boyd said. “Once we hit
the first play [of the drive], we started
rolling from there. Once we hit another
play, then everything really started to
click. Once we get into that kind of
rhythm, we’re hard to beat.”

Pitt then had a golden opportunity

“at taking the lead when defensive line-

man Aaron Donald forced a fumble that
was recovered by defensive lineman
Darryl Render at the Panthers’ own 39.

FOOTBALL

Donald’s play was part of a day that saw
him record 11 total tackles, six tackles
for loss and a sack.

But Pitttwas unable to take advan-
tage of the big play, as -the team gained
just 6 yards before punting yet again.
Pitt’s defense forced a three-and—out
at the Yellow Jackets’ expense, and‘ the
Panthers regained possession at their
own 12.

With 4:09 left in the third, Savage
andthe Panthers reached the 50-yard
line‘ as the quarter ended. Once again,
Pitt’s offense stalled, and the Panthers
were forced to punt after a rush by ju-
nior running back Isaac Bennett went

2 for just 1 yard and a pass from Savage
‘ to Boyd fell incomplete.

The teams traded punts until, at the
10:04 mark, Georgia Tech took more

than seven minutes off the clock with a -

13-play, 80-yard drive that culminated
with Godhigh’s second touchdown of the
day. Godhigh finished with 89 yards on
just 6 carries, and his second score put
the Yellow Jackets up 21-10.

The Panthers seemingly had them-
selves set up to take back possession,
as Donald tackled Georgia Tech quar-
terback Vad Lee twice for a loss‘, which

, led to a third-and-17 at Georgia Tech’s

46. On the next play, Lee was flushed
from the pocket and forced to chuck a

.prayer downﬁeld into double coverage.

With Pitt defensive backs Lafayette

Pitts and Ray Vinopal each covering .

DeAndre Smelter, the Yellow Jackets’
6~foot—3 wideout outjumped Pitt’s de-
fense to pull in a 42-yard gain that set
up Godhigh’s touchdown.

 

   
 

Down by 11 points with about 2 1/2
minutes remaining, Savage attempted
to lead the Panthers to an improbable
comeback. But Savage threw an inter-
ception with 32 seconds remaining,
allowing Georgia Tech to close out the
game. 1.

Savage posted one of his better sta-
tistical performances of late, complet-
ing 25-of-37 passes for233 yards with a
touchdown and an interception. But he
was sacked ﬁve times and was unable
to complete passes in key situations.

Pitt’s inability to score once again
proved a recurring theme for the Pan-
thers, as the defense kept Pitt in Satur-
day’s contest but féund little support
from the offense. 1

“Our defense did an amazingjob to-
night,” Savage said. “We need to go out
and put points on the board, especially
when we get turnovers against ‘a team
like Georgia Tech because they don’t
turn the ball over much.”

The loss was third in four games for
the reeling Panthers, who must win two
of t_heir remaining-four games in order
to attain bowl eligibility.

.“We have to bounce back,” Savage
said. “We don’t really have another op-
tion.” I , ,
