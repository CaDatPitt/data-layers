UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH _

Cowell conﬁdent
Senate will pass
open-records bill

By Jenna Ferrara
T be Pitt News

State Rep. Ron Cowell received a Pitt faculty-
circulated petition last week signed by over 3,600
who support his bill to open the ﬁnancial records
of Pitt and other state—related universities.

The amendment to the state Right to Know law
is currently stalled in the state Senate. It passed the
state House by a vote of 202-1.

Cowell, D—Wilkins, said he doesn’t know why the
bill has been tabled since the summer.

“I don’t understand it. I don’t think [the senators]
have read it, to tell you the truth,” said Cowell, the
chairperson of the House Education Committee.
“The Senate has not been helpful to our cause.”

He also blamed the holdup on the commonwealth
trustees. '

“Some of them happen to be state senators and
have the power to make things happen or slow
things down,” Cowell said.

But he said the bill would pass “sooner or later
 We’re going to prevail.’’

The bill has the support of students, faculty and
staff at Pitt but is “opposed by a few high-ranking
administrators,” Cowell said. '

Cowell said he is open to negotiating what
records the bill should cover, but he said he is not
willing to back down to criticism from Pitt President
J. Dennis O’Connor that the bill would hurt research
by opening records to the public.

“Let’s start out assuming that everything should
be covered  I am not willing to start out saying
there are instances so specific they shouldn't be
covered at all,” Cowell said.

O’Connor approved of the bill before he came to
Pitt, but a few weeks at the university seemed to
have changed his mind, Cowell said.

O’Connor was unavailable for comment.

Cowell said he had proposed the bill before
scandals broke over the summer about former Pitt
President Wesley Posvar’s $3.3 million retirement
settlement. .

“I didn't introduce the bill because of the
controversy swirling at Pitt,” he said.

The idea for the bill came after Penn State
students had sued the university for access to Penn
State’s budget. A court had ruled that the state Right
to Know law did not apply to state-related schools.

According to Cowell, Penn State administrators
came to the state government shortly after the

Homecoming Queen Natalie Pecora and King Brock Hamula hugged after being crowned at Saturday's game.

Homecoming King and Queen crowned

The Pitt News

Pitt’s homecoming week ended in
victory for Natalie Pecora and Brock
Hamula, —who were crowned 1991
homecoming queen and king at
halftime of Saturday’s game.

Dozens of Pecora’s Chi Omega

sorority sisters and Hamula’s Sigma
Phi Epsilon fraternity brothers
swarmed down onto the ﬁeld to
congratulate the winners.

Prior to the crowning, Hamula said

he would really like to win. “People
laugh about it, but it’s important to
me. .“ »
Hamula added that he would like
to see homecoming nominee Natalie
Pecora win because “she’s done a lot
for the university.”

As the Pitt band, accompanied by
the Pitt Alumni band, finished its
halftime performance, homecoming-
nominee supporters pressed against
the fence along the track, waiting
patiently for that impending

announcement."

Pecora said she had been “nervous
all week,” while Hamula said that he
wasn’t nervous until ' “the last 20
minutes."

Last year’s homecoming king and
queen, Franz Jobson and Lisa Tate,
stood together on the side of the field
waiting to crown this year’s king and
queen. A

“I feel like my time is over,” Tate
said. “It’s someone else’s turn.”

Hamula’s and Pecora’s parents were

there to see their children win. -

Keg Roll

Pitt’s President]. Dennis O’Connor

beat Vice President of Student Affairs
William Harmon in the first race of
this year’s annual homecoming keg
roll, held Friday afternoon.
The Pitt Program Counci1’s event
attracted 17 student teams, which
competed through a grueling obstacle
course.

Each team consisted of four
participants. The first players rolled a
keg with a broom and ran through a
tire course to a spot where they
kneeled down to be “shaved” by

player two. Whipped cream was
sprayed on their faces and shaved off
with a popsicle sticks. The second
players then threw pies into pairs of
garbage—bag pants worn by their third
teammates. '

Players then proceeded to pass
balloons between their knees until
they reached other teammates, who
took over by jumping rope and tossing
eggs into buckets on the heads of the
fourth team members. Many
misguided eggs ended up splattering
the faces of the participants.

These players then hopped a few
feet in a burlap sack to a baseball bat
which had to be held upright and
spun around 10 times.

After regaining their balance, which
some had difficulty doing, the
participants finished the race by
guiding a keg through their lane and
to the finish line, where the rest of
their team waited and cheered them
on. "

“Everyone was just out to have a
good time,” said Shari Bienstock, co-
chairperson of the event. “It was
almost as much fun watching the

Abortion nez/erjnstifiea’, Representative Friend says

By Suzann Gries_
For The Pitt News

The single most important issue facing
the world today is human life, said State
Rep. Steven Friend ,R-Delaware County,
at a college pro-life conference Saturday.

Friend, who is running against Arlen
Specter in the Republican primary for the
US. Senate, said that defeating Specter is
“a moral imperative.

“Specter is a blazing, liberal Democrat
thinly disguised in Republican clothing,”
Friend said.

In an hour—long speech at Carnegie
Mellon, Friend outlined his position on
several important issues in his campaign,

such as abortion, capital punishment, the
appointment of federaland Supreme Court
justices and civil rights.

Friend considers himself the “point man
of the pro-life movement.”

Friend does not support abortion under
any circumstances, including cases when
the life of the mother is threatened or’
when the pregnancy is the result of rape
or incest.

Friend said that making exceptions to
abortion “makes no sense whatsoever.”

When a women has been raped, abortion
“does not make the rape go away; it
merely suggests that you subject the woman
to another act of violence,” Friend said.

Friend said that although there are many

people who disagree with him on the
abortion issue, the people who disagree
with him respect him for his honesty.

Friend also explained his views on other
controversial issues.

Friend said he thinks homosexuals
should be excluded in civil rights acts
because they have a choice as to whether
they are gay or not, and the choices they

makeare abnormal.

Friend supports the death penalty
because, “There are crimes in my opinion
that are so heinous they deserve death."
He added that the death penalty has pro-
ven to be an effective deterrent to crime.

If Friend is elected to the Senate, part of
his job will be voting to confirm nominees

"for appointment to the Supream Court.

Friend said he supports the appointment
of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
According to Friend, his campaign
pressured Arlen Specter into voting for
Thomas because Specter wants to be re-
elected and therefore had to vote for
Thomas in an effort to look good in front
of the Republican Party.

“This is an insult to conservatives or
people that have brains," Friend said.

Friend does not have the endorsement
of the Republican Party. “What I want to
teach Republicans is that the more we
move to the left and the more we move
away from the values we’ve embraced,
then we deserve exactly what we get.”

In another effort to keep the
Student Government Board
, accountable, the President's
‘ Council was formed to replace
the now-defunct Representative
Student Council.
9 The President’s Council was
formed last year by SGB President
Brent Saunders and member Gil
Golden as a replacement fpr the
RSC. The RSC was open to any
interested individual who wanted
to see what the SGB was doing.
, 9 However according to Golden,
the RSC wasn't working.

“It seemed the students lost
interest,” Golden said. “The
reason we formed the RSC was
‘because we wanted more student
,opinions.We would spend

' hundreds of dollars on ads in the
paper and a lot of time [planning
meetings], and maybe 20 people
would show up. We needed
something more efficient and
practical.”

The President’s Council’s

 

 

 

functions are to discuss what the
SGB is doing and to find out what
groups would like to see the SGB
do in the future.

“When we are making big
decisions, we want to bring it to
the student groups and get their
feedback,” Golden said. “This
will help us to make better
decisions.”

The President’s Council
incorporates the presidents of
the student governance groups
on campus. The Interfraternity
Council, Panhellenic Association,
Black Action Sociew, Engineering
Student Cabinet, Pharmacy
Student Association, Nursing
Student Association, Resident

. Student Association and the SGB

comprise the council.

“These are the core groups, but
the meetings are not closed. Other
[student] - groups can attend,”
Saunders said.

“We wanted to have the largest
groups on campus represented,”
Golden said.

“Anyone can call a meeting
when they want to discuss

something,” he said. J

“There have been problems in
the past with what the SGB was
doing,” Saunders said. “We want
to keep the SGB accountable. We
want students to know people
are watching the Student
Government Board. "

“Sometimes groups are afraid
of criticism, but we want to try to
use the criticism constructively
and‘ try to improve on what we
are doing,” Saunders said.

At its first meeting this year, the
council approved of the plans to
make approximately 4,000 passes
available to non-CGS
undergraduate students for

admission to the Carnegie
Museum.

In addition, the council
endorsed placing an SGB bulletin
board outside the Towers lobby.
The bulletin board will contain
information on what the SGB and
other student groups are
doing. 9

There was also a suggestion to
have “open, assembly—type

meetings with [Pitt President J. _

Dennis] O’Connor and the student
groups,” Golden said. “This is
still in the very beginning stages.”

Pitt President J. Dennis
O’Connor was unavailable for
comment.

Phipps Conservatory has
become a sinister, dark palace of
horrors for the Halloween season.

This weekend, people lined up
at Phipps Conservatory for its
annual “Fright Nights” to be scared

by the demons and monsters in“

Phipps’ “Boo-tanical” gardens.
The elaborate course took
visitors through twists and turns
and kept them guessing at who
or what would leap out from the
branches around the next corner.
The tour began with a scene
from the Addams Family and a
scene depicting Edward
Scissorbands, with eerie music
playing in the background.
Visitors progressed through
turns in the dimly lit trail, with
signs such as “Death Ahead”
guiding their way.
After an appearance by Andy
\X/arhol’s ghost, there was a scene
with Benjamin Pew in his coffin.

Witches, vampires and the Grim

visitors came upon a scene from
Little Shop of Horrors. “Venus de

chilling favorite.

After passing an eerie castle
scene, the trail led to a dark
tunnel with cave-like walls. At
the end of the tunnel, visitors
were treated to the sight of Day-
Glow tropical fish floating in an
underwater atmosphere. Mist,
along with light music and
bubbling sounds, produced an
effect that gave visitors the

along with sound effects, made

“I must have been in a bad mood that week, but it just I
tweaked me the wrong way  to hear someone speaking out
of both sides of their mouth that way,” Cowell said.

Administrators at Pitt also said the university was public when
asking for money but private when it came time to reveal
information, according to Cowell. “Every time Chancellor
Posvar came to us, he said, ‘[Pitt] is a public institution, and you
need to give us more money.”’

If bill 1075 were passed, “Somebody could go in and take a .

doing anything other than being
yourself, you are our best
marketing strategy,” he said.

Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie
Masloff, who attended Friday’s
reception, said she is pleased
with the appointment of
O’Connor and with the university,
since it is “the city’s largest
employer.”

Alumni, faculty, staff, students
and friends ofthe university were
-invited to the reception, which
was held in the commons room
of the Cathedral of Learning.

\X/arren.B. Dana, CA8 ’48, said
he has seen a lot of changes in
the university. “In a sense I feel
very old because when I was a
television director, the first
program I did was from the [yet
unopened] Fitzgerald Field
House. Now they are saying that
the facility is out—of—date and
inadequate,” Dana said.

Pitt student Linda Kazmerski,
who is runni-ng in the upcoming
SGB elections, said, “I wanted to
come because I felt the alumni
could give some important insight
into the types of issues I should
incorporate into my work as a
possible SGB member.”

Fireworks and Laser Show

Fireworks lit up the sky and
laser beams streaked across
Bigelow Boulevard on Friday
night, as the Pitt,Program Council

held a show that combined
pyrotechnics
technology to celebrate the
homecoming game.

iwith laser

Over 1,000 spectators gathered
to watch the show. The ﬁreworks
started with roman candles and
continued with brilliant bursts ——
both large and small —— of red,
orange, blue, green and yellow.

A truck with white tracer lights
was parked at the intersection of
Fifth Ave. and Bigelow Blvd. The
four tracer lights were spun
around on a rotating platform,
causing lights to streak across the
Cathedral.

The laser created images of an
eagle, a star, a trombone, a track-

runner, wavelengths, tunnels, and ~

an outline of the United States.
The images were projected on

/‘three triangular screens placed in

front of the Union.

The fireworks and laser images
were all done to the sounds of
pop and classical music, starting
with James Brown’s “Living in
America” and finishing with
“Rhapsody in Blue” by George
Gershwin.

The fireworks ended with a
loud, brilliant finale of many short
bursts, while the lasershow ended
with an image of a huge Pitt
panther running across the
Cathedral.

“I think that it is incredible that
Pitt is doing this,” said Harry

Gerdes, founder and owner of _

Centrak Lasers, the company that
brought the laser show to Pitt.
“I’ve done small fireworks and
laser shows at other campuses,
and I've never seen anything on
this scale before.”

“I can be an ‘artist in the sky,”
said Dave Lepley, one of only
seven full-time pyrotechnicians
with Zambelli Fireworks,
explaining why he loves his job.

a frenzy.

To eliminate some confusion, The Pittsburgh Press
yesterday published a detailed list of what items are now
taxable and what items are not.

Many mistakes have appeared in the past two weeks on
registers throughout the. state, mostly due to the
indecisiveness of the particulars of taxable and non-
taxable iterns._

Consumers have good reason to be confused, especially
after a careful analysis of the actual items. One of the
major problems with these taxes is the way in which they
were implemented.

Announcements came by way of the media, but all of
the specifics were not given to the purchasing public. To
alleviate the confusion, the administration may have sent
mailers to the residents of Pennsylvania explaining where
this revenue will be drawn from and, more importantly,
why. I f

_ It appears as though Casey and his administration have
decided to tax items they deem as “non-necessities.” For
example, suntan lotion is taxable, but sunburn lotion is
not. It is possible that suntan lotion is not required for
survival, and sunburn lotion assists in preventing skin
cancer, but specifics such as these only confuse consumers
and retail workers.

A shopping experiment conducted by Joe Grata, a
reporter for the Press, proved that cashiers were also
confused about what should be taxed and what shouldn’t

be taxed. A total of 14 tax errors occurred at Hills.’

Department Store and G.C.- Murphy Company, with an
“extra tax to the customer” totalling only $1.1 1. One of the
most ironic taxes encountered by'Grata_ was one for a U.S.
ﬂag. Although the ﬂags are considered non-taxable by the
Pennsylvania Department of Revenue, Grata was charged
6 percent tax on each ﬂag he purchased at the different
stores. a

The list of new taxes printed in the Presswas taken from
an issue of the Pennsylvania Bulletin, a_ state-sponsored
publication. Although the list included the tax specifics,
an explanation of why certain items are taxed and others
are not was not offered. '

It is obviously a ﬂaw in the Casey administration that the
public was not well informed of these new charges.

The public is not the only group left out in the cold
concerning this new policy. Merchants and other vendors
that directly charge the public do not have a clear
explanation of the taxes. ‘

As struggling college students, none of us take kindly to
paying extra money for “non-necessities.” However the
state is in debt, and although the deficit is not necessarily
our faults, we do need to contribute. Disapproval for the
administration is well-justified. These taxes should .have
been clearly defined before they were implemented.

War is hell and our fighting force is the best in
the world. However, it would hit home harder than
a yellow ribbon if we were facing down another
“America” that desired the same things we do. Why
do Americans, renowned for the uniqueness _of
their creativity, resourcefulness and ability, resort to
imposing their values on other countries?

We’ve found ourselves on the top of the heap
now that the Soviet Union ceases to exist, and so an
atrociw like the Gulf war elicits.

I’m not concerned about whether you were in ,

favor of the war or not. _
However, if Bush associates the results of the

Gulf war with his qualifications as the “foreign V»

policy president,” then in fairness to him we should
take a good look at his “new world order.” Like the
Vietnam War, (with the opposite effect) "the Gulf

Therefore, the Gulf war was good for the United
States and goodfor me too!‘ Right?!

Recently, National Public Radio broadcasted a
different evaluation of the Gulf war. (That’s funny,
it doesn’t sound like a radical “leftist” radio station.)
Senior news analyst Daniel Shorr drew three
conclusions from the Persian Gulf war:

oln the name of “liberating Kuwait,” the United
States forced Iraq’s withdrawal but restored to the
throne a feudal and despotic regime, indifferent to
fundamental human rights.

-Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was portrayed as a
threat to the economies of petroleum-dependent
Western nations. A year since Iraqi and Kuwaiti

’ petroleum exports ceased. Not only has oil continued ‘

to flow to the West, but gasoline prices have also
actually gone down. Yet destruction of petroleum
facilities and resources, as well as prices, will
increase in the long run because of military allied
actions. .

evil, remains in power. While Bush said our nation

control‘ over the United Nations. The United States

As the Cold War is over, one might have expected

to happen? Bush said he would like to commission

the construction of 75 stealth bombers. There are '

three B-2 bombers (stealth) currently operable, and
each costs $800 million.

Orangemen use ground game to bury Panthers 

Big day
for SU’S  
Walker

By Derek Willis J V
Asst. Sports Editor

Standing outside the
locker room after Saturday’s
.win, Syracuse tailback
David Walker was excited.
“This mightbe the only
comeback of my life,” he.
said. “It was just a great
game." ._ ‘
Opposing coaches had
better hope that Walker
limits his "comeback
performances to once a
year or fewer. Walker ran
over, around and through
the Pitt defense for 138
. yards , and four
touchdowns, leading the
Orangemen to a 31-27 win
over Pitt. '
Walker and quarterback
- Marvin Graves were “the v

which overcame numerous
‘mistakes on the road.
Graves pushed the team
down the field, and Walker
usually finished it off with
a short burst. For the day,
the yardage for "his scoring

and one.
 “I was just running hard,”
Walker said. “We wanted

Syracuse tailback David Walker scores one of his four touchdowns Saturday. Walker had a career-high 138 yards rushing.

Turnovers are usually the
difference in a football game.

In most cases, the team that
turns the ball over the most stands
a very real chance of losing the
game. Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett said earlier this year that
when a player fumbles, he
fumbles away the hopes of the
entire team.

Fate turned the tables on the
Panthers Saturday. Pitt had only
one turnover; the Orangemen
had six. Syracuse won 31-27.

The Panthers took advantage
of their chances. They scored 20
points directly after an Orange
miscue. However the one
turnover for the Panthers loomed
extremely huge.

Pitt got the ball when linebacker
Ricardo McDonald sacked
Syracuse quarterback Marvin
Graves, causing him to fumble.
McDonald recovered the ball at
the Orange 21.

With 2:22 left in the third
quarter, Pitt had the ball second-
and-goal at the Orange two. A
pass from quarterback Alex Van
Pelt intended for Jermaine

Williams dropped incomplete. On
third down, Van Pelt again
attempted to. pass for the score.

Syracuse linebacker Garland
Hawkins had a touchdown of his
own on his mind. Hawkins picked
off Van Pelt’s pass and raced 52
yards before being tripped up by
Van Pelt at the Pitt 46.

The second mistake that hurt

S the Panthers was not turnovers

but the inability to move the
football.

Since Curtis'Martin left the
lineup after the first series at
Notre Dame with a sprained toe,
the Pitt running attack has been

hobbling as well.

Jermaine Williams, the starter
at the beginning of the year, has
had his effectiveness hampered
by a strained ligament. Glenn
Deveaux has been sidelined with
an ankle injury. The rest of the
backs are either young or_
inexperienced.

Williams had 28 yards on 12
carries. First—year student Tim i
Colicchio had six carries for 40
yards in his first collegiate action.
All told, the Panther ground attack
amassed 69 yards on 20 carries,
with one TD by Williams.

Soccer loses final home game to Providence, 2-0

By Jason Billings and
Brian Gallagher
Sta_[f Writers

The Pitt Panther soccer team
bought itself a third consecutive
loss yesterday as it wrapped up
its ’9l home season with a 2-0
defeat at the hand of the
Providence College Friars.

“We had a super effort against
West Virginia,” head coach Joe
Luxbacher said, referring to
Wednesday’s matchup. “I’m at a
loss as to why we didn’t play with
any emotion in this game.”

After losing a tough battle 1-0
to the West Virginia Mountaineers
last Wednesday, the Pitt soccer

team ha°s'0een strugglingﬁo boost" 

its concentration during the game
as well as its Big East record. That
record now stands at 0-4-2, one
of the worst records in the BE. A
victory against Providence
College would have given the
Panthers a desperately needed
win as well as that emotional
high that they have sought all
season.

“The game was a total letdown
from WVU,” said Panthers
assistant coach Heinz Pak. “It
was a total lack of effort, like a
l80—degree turn.

“The defense didn’t play well.
It was just a really bad effort,” Pak
said. “I hope the guys were
disappointed,” he said.

“You have to love the gafne to

play it well. Maybe the guys just
don’t love it enough. They weren't
playing for themselves or the
university. It was just another
game.” '

The uninspired play of Pitt was
in stark contrast to its valiant
effort against the Mountaineers.
That game was marked by the

return of solid, defensive soccer .

that typifies Luxbacher’s
philosophy. The mental mistakes
that had plagued the Panthers in
previous losses were supposedly
corrected.

Pak was really impressed with
Pitt’s defense against WVU on
Wednesday. “West Virginia had a
quick passing game, so we knew

we had to play a passing defense" ‘

and not get too aggressive," he
said, “and once we did that, West
Virginia got ﬂustered.”

Unfortunately for the Panthers,
the same non-aggressive, “wait-
and-see” defense that worked
against WVU failed at home
against the fast—paced Friar
offense.

The Friars burned the defense,
using long passes that spread the
Pitt defense out. The Panther
zone never adjusted to the
different style and was repeatedly
beaten by the faster Providence
team.

Providence, which improved
its record to 6-5-1, was led by

,midfielder John Martin with a

goal ariﬁan assist. Hrs fssist was‘

aided by a Pitt defensive
breakdown in which the Panthers
failed to clear a carom from
Martin’s shot that hit the post.
Friar defenderJeff Scott pounced
on the rebound and buried it in
the right corner of the net.

The Panthers’ offense outshot
the Friars 7 to 6 but could not
capitalize on any of the
opportunities. “I think our most
talented players are playing, and
that’s why they are starting,”
Luxbacher said. “But we don’t
seem to be getting things done
with the guys we have in there."

The coaches have shuffled the
starting offensive lineup to
“generate offense. ” After the WVU

Steelers lose to Seahawks as _offense sputters again

By Ryan Buncher
Staff Writer

“I’m at your disposal,” Steeler
head coach Chuck Noll said after
his team’s 27-7 loss to Seattle. “All
you have to do is pull the chain.”

That seemed to be what his
team said to the Seahawks with
their performance. The Steelers
seemed to make enough mistakes
to give the game to their
opponents, who seemed reluctant
to accept at first.

They started their first drive
with a false-start penalty, had a
fumble by Barry Foster and a

de1ay—.of—game penalty, which
ended the drive with a dropped
pass by receiver Jeff Graham.
Dan Stryzinski got off a 53-yard
punt, but Jerrol Williams went
down field early. Patrick Hunter
blocked the next kick. Greg Lloyd
recovered the kick at the Steeler
21 and fumbled at the 25. Then
Richard Shelton jumped on it at
the 29.

The officials debated for five
minutes, decided to put the ball

where Lloyd fumbled and then _

put the ball in the wrong place:
the 21. The Seahawks went all of
two yards with the ball, setting

loss the lineup was changed to
give starters who are not
performing a “shock,” Pak said.

These changes do not seem to

A be working, though.

“Maybe I think we can do things
that we can’t do," Luxbacher said.
“The players have to accept
responsibility for motivating
themselves. We don't have
enough players that are
lmotivatedl.”

In the last four Big East games

‘the Panthers employed an

optimistic, revolving-door lineup,
but their opponents have
outscored them 10 to 2. The

possibility of changing the lineup
still exists, Luxbacher said.

_Changing a lineup can do two
things to a struggling team. It
gives backups an opportunity to
gain experience and a chance at
a starting position, and it gives
previous starters a chance to mull
over what they did wrong.

A problem with frequent
changes is that it does not promote
stability in the lineup.

The Panthers could find
difficulty in forming a cohesive
offense that must stand up to the
test of away games against
Syracuse and the undefeated, Big
East leader, Seton Hall.

Game

Continued from page 6
In contrast, Syracuse’s David Walker carried

the ball 25 times for 138 yards and four TDs.
The Panthers have only scored six times on
the ground all season.

Unlike last week against Notre Dame,
where both the run and the pass were
virtually eliminated, Van Pelt had decent
numbers through the air. He completed 18
passes out of 31 attempts for 267 yards and
two TDs. The problem with the pass-oriented
offense is the inability to sustain time-
consuming drives.

“When you are a passing team, you better
complete them,” Hackett said. “If you don't
keep completing them and you don’t have a
running game, your defense is in for a long
day. That’s what happened to us.”

The Pitt defense was on the field for 38:57,

almost double the time that the offense spent on the
gridiron. The Orangemen kept the ball a whopping
10:56 in the fourth quarter, a major contributing
factor to their comeback.

The biggest instance where the Panthers needed
to hold onto the football and could not occurred
with 5:59 left to play. Pitt got the ball at their Own
20 after a Walker touchdown cut their lead to 27-24.
Aftei two incomplete passes, Van Pelt completed a
short pass to tight end Dave Moore. The toss only
went for eight yards, and the Panthers had to punt.
Total time of possession: 1:04.

Syracuse drove the ball 73 yards for the winning‘
score, a one-yard run by Walker. '

The Panthers now enter their upcoming game
against East Carolina coming off two losses. The
Pirates enter the game after a bye. The previous
week they defeated Syracuse 23-20 in the Carrier
Dome.

but both Walker and Graves were
quick to credit the downfield
blocking as a key to the ground
game. “They didn’t catch a lot of
passes, but they were out there
busting their butts," Walker said.

Pitt .linebacker Ricardo
McDonald agreed with Walker.
“Their wide receivers did a
tremendous job blocking our
defensive backs. There was times
when I’d hit the quarterback, and
[Walker] would be eight or 10
yards upfield.” ' I

Graves recovered from a poor
first half to hurt Pitt. Despite
fumbles and interceptions, the
sophomore signal—caller came
back and engineered Syra_cuse’s
last two scoring drives in fine
fashion. “That’s a tribute to
Marvin,” Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett said. “The heat was on
him, and he had to make the
plays —_ and he did.”

With all of the attention
surrounding teammates Graves
and Qadry Ismail, Walker tends
to go unnoticed. But his
teammates and coach praised his
hard work' and ability.

“David Walker does not take
any plays off,” Graves said.»“He’s

. not that fast, but one man is not
going to bring him down.”

After last week's second-half
disaster against East Carolina,
Walker was not ready to give up
in the final minutes. “There was
no way we weren’t going to score
on the last drive,” he said. “We
were tired, but we just did it.”

That last drive put the Panthers
away and made Pasqualoni a
happy man.

One reason he felt so good was
Marvin Graves. Another, bigger
one was David Walker. “He was

. just outstanding today, and he
really deserves it,” Pasqualoni

said.

linebacker Greg Lloyd, who
decided to hit Chadwick instead
of catching the ball, which
bounced off Lloyd’s backside.
Lloyd proceeded to rough Krieg
on the next play, setting up a
touchdown pass to Chadwick.
Seattle took a 17-0 lead into the
half. ‘

The Steelers, again not scoring
any points in the first half, had
fumbled three times (losing one)
and taken 10 penalties.

Pittsburgh actually got back in
the game early in the third quarter
on one play. O’Donnell
underthrew receiver Dwight
Stone, who adjusted well, caught

_. the ball and sprinted into the end

zone for a 54-yard touchdown.

The Seahawks came out with a
four—receiver offense on the next
drive, moving the ball 66 yards
on 12 plays to set up a 21-yard
field goal by Kasay, extending
the lead to 20-7. More importantly,
the drive took 7:19 off the clock.

The Steelers had one more
threat in the fourth quarter, when
receiver Ernie Mills found some
open space deep. But O’Donnell
underthrew the pass, and Eugene
Robinson picked it off for Seattle.
Three plays- later, a blown
assignment in the Steeler
secondary left Tommy Kane wide
open. Krieg hit him with a short
pass, and the receiver ran it all
the way to the three-yard line.
Krieg hit tight endjohn Tice from
‘a yard out for the touchdown two
plays later.

For the game, Pittsburgh had
14 penalties, two turnovers and a
blocked punt. Center Dermontti
Dawson and guard T om Ricketts

each had three false starts..

Cornerback Rod Woodson had
two late penalties for
unsportsmanlike conduct.
O’Donnell completed 14 of 22
passes for 184 yards, one
touchdown and one interception.

"But the only score he led the

team to was on the badly thrown

ball to Stone, and he was sacked
four times. Barry Foster carried
only seven times for 36 yards and
two fumbles before leaving the
game with a sprained ankle in
the third quarter. Worst of all,
tight end Eric Green, the so-
called focal point of the offense,
caught only one pass for 18 yards.

The offense still can’t play in
the first half, and the defense still
can’t stop the short—passing game.
Krieg ended up with 25
completions on 31 passes for 266
yards and two touchdowns. The
margin of victory might have
been greater for the Seahawks if
they hadn’t run 50 times for only
65 yards.

Rugby dominates Cazlz'f0rm'oz

By Derek Wﬂlis
Asst. Sports Editor

Pitt’s rugby football club used an
overpowering team attack to prevail over a
tough California University of Pennsylvania
squad on Saturday, 14-4.

Three players scored a try each, but it was
the total domination by the pack that allowed
the Panthers to win. Cal came into the
match rated among the top ﬁve teams in the
Allegheny Rugby Union. '

“It was really just outstanding team play,”
John Lewis, a team member, said. “Most of
the scoring came as a result of total support
by the entire team. It was just a matter ofthe

scorer being in the right place at the right
time.” ,

Pitt’s forwards dominated the game against
a hard-playing Cal team, winning every
scrum.

The Panthers remain unbeaten at 3-0,
with two matches and a tournament
upcoming. .

Lewis, Neil Scott and Don Huber scored
tries for Pitt, and Brian Hannen added the
points after.

As a result ofthis weekend’s win, the Pitt
club willlikely receive an ARU ranking.
After playing a men’s club next week, the
team travels to Penn State on Nov. 2.
