HUAC For   Demands

For Organization Lists

by DOUGLAS STANTON
When a university supplies the House Committee on'Un-Amer-
ican Activities (HUAC) with lists of individuals in certain campus
organizat-ions, “. . . this may be a serious infringement of academic
freedom and freedom of speech,” according to Attorney Thomas

Kerr.

Kerr spoke Friday, sponsored by the Western Pennsylvania
Academic Council (WPAC) and the Students for Peace. The sub-
ject of his address was “Effect of War and Wartime Upon the Law

and Liberty.”

Attorney Kerr, who is chairman of the Allegheny County and

Pennsylvania State branches of
the American Civil Liberties
Union, further stated that, “The
privacy of such organizatiiion
membership lists should un-
doubtedly encourage more peo-
ple to participate in speech and
association.”

i “The most important effect of
war upon any aspect of liberty

is upon the freedom of speech,”_

stated Kerr. “And in wartime,
the desire for security or the
dedication to victory often out-
weights the desire for liberty.”

As an example of such a de-
sire, Kerr referred to HUAC’s’
subpoenas last summer to the
University of Michigan and the
University of California for
membership lists of campus or-

ganizations who had expressed .

opposition to the war. “There
may be a serious ‘infringement
of academic freedom and free-
dom of speech in requiring that
such lists be furnished to the
government," said Kerr.

“It is always a question wheth-
er we will be wise enough in
wartime to maintain freedom of
discussion so that full demo-
cracy can be continued,” said
Kerr. The attorney indicated
that he has been encouraged by
recent court decisions that the
United States was choosing de-

mocracy and not suppression of . '

free speech over the .Vietnam
War.

Referring to the fact that
young men may not have the
right to counsel when appear-
ing before draft boards, Kerr
stated that “perhaps they should
have the right to counsel in the
important early proceedings at

draft board hearings.”

Speaking before an audience
of about 20, Kerr called the Me-
Carran Internal Security Act of
1952, “the ﬁrst preventive de-
tention law everito be passed
by a United States Congress and

ATTORNEY THOMAS KERR-
ACLU Clzaxirnwn

perhaps the ﬁrst ever to appear
in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.”
The 1952 Act provides for pen-
alties for individuals suspected
of espionage.

Following his talk, Kerr ac-
cepted questions from the audi-
ence.

The question-and-answer ses-
sion became quite informal and
at times the speaker listened as
two individuals in the audience
argued with each other.
During the session, the secre-
tary of WPAC, Professor Rob-
ert H. Gibson, complained that

cu-t of 30 press releases sent out‘

by his organization announcing
Kerr's address, only two were
printed. The Pitt News was one
of the two newspapers that
printed the release.

Professor Gibson did not point
out that the release printed in
the Pitt News and many signs
around -the campus of the Uni-
versity gave the site of Mr.
Kerr's speech as 624 Cathedral
of Learning. The speech was ac-
tually held in G-24 CL.

Discusses Incoming Classes 

Chancellor Wesley W. Pos-

.var took office officially last _

Thursday, andthe next day
he met with The Pitt News

to discuss key issues that ,

concern the" student body.

The topic he concentrated on =

most heavily was the status
of out-of-state students at our

, University.

“The large increase in in-st-ate
students has produced a tremen-
dous surge of quality in the in-
coming class,” Dr. Posvar stress-
ed. “At the same time, we in
the administration -all feel that
a signiﬁcant representation of
students from other regions and
countries is essential to the cos-
mopolitan nature of our Uni-
versity.” .

When asked to comment on
the decrease of out-of-state stu-
dents in the incoming freshman
class, the Chancellor replied, “In
terms of statistics, there has
been strictly a temporary ad-
justment, which reﬂects more
than anything else the lack of
dormitory facilities.

The ﬁgure of out-of-state stu-

dents has dropped temporarily
to approximately 20 per cent of
this year's freshman class’, Dr.
Posvar stated, adding that “we
shall make every effort to bring
this ratio to wh-at we consider

the desirable area of 30 per cent.
When we do this, I think we
should bear in mind that it is
more important to obtain stu-
dents from more distant regions
and from abroad than from the
technically out-of-state areas of
West Virginia and Ohio. These,
in terms of cultural outlook, are

equivalent to Pennsylvania.”
Dr. Posvar requested the stu-
dents to make their own effort

to alter the out-of-state ratio to’
_a more _ favorable figure: ‘We _
urge all "students to write to

their cousins in Florida and Cali-

fornia and sing the praises of ~

Pitt.”

Off-Campus Housing Committee

AWS Booklet Helps Room Hunters

by BEVERLY LOY TAYLOR
Tohelp ease the transis-
tion from dorms to apart-
ments for Women who

choose to live off-campus, As-
sociated Women Students

(AWS) has set up an Off-
Campus Housing Commit-
tee headed by Susan Klein-
berg.’

The ﬁrst project for the
Committee is to publish a
booklet during August with
"the help of the Dean of Wom-

en's office. Miss Kleinberg said.

that “most people don't realize
what's involved in moving into,

tually means. or that they might

Language Requirements

Under Review At Harvard

The Harvard Policy Commit-
tee has recommended a review
of Harvard’s two-course lan-
guage requirement for all un-

. dergraduates. The recommenda-

tion was made in the light of
the disclosure that -about 50 Har-
vard students suffer from strep-
hosymbolia, a rare disease
which makes it impossible for
one to grasp a foreign language.
Another 25 to 50 students are
reported to have excessive dif-
ficulty with foreign languages.

Students at the University ap-

 parently are not as, susceptible

students, because Dr. Douglas
Thompson, director of the Uni-
versity Health Service, stated
that he has never treated a Uni-
versity student who had been
stricken by the malady.

However, students may have
excessive difficulty with a lan-
guage, and James A. Kehl, dean
of the School of Liberal Arts,
has said. that students may be
able to resolve the problem,
other than ﬂunk the course.

Although there is no official

policy,. students. -who “demons- ,

a. substitute means of fulﬁlling
the language requirement.

Linguistics or perhaps philo-
sophy may be substituted for
the language requirement. Dean
Kehl said that “it is not a new

idea to suggest alternatives” to _

the requirements.

He said that it is usually “the
science people who are oPIP0Sed"~
to the loosening of the language
requirements” because they

the beneﬁts of proﬁc'ien'cy. in
another _language. _g   A‘ g

supply of groceries from a su-
permarket a half -mile away.”
The booklet is planned as a
jumping-off point and as a
source to help girls avoid some
mistakes many people have made
in choosing apartments.

The booklet will contain some-
ideas regarding the pros and
cons of living off-campus. It
will include hints in ﬁnding an
apartment — furnished or un-
furnished, roommates, utilities,
location, landlords and real es-
tate agencies, budgeting for food’
and household supplies.

Miss Kleinberg emphasized"
that her committee will not dup-
licate the efforts of the Depart-
ment of Off-Campus Housing in
the Student Affairs area or the
Student Governmerit Off-Cam-
pus Housing Committee. Where-
as the latter two are primarily
concerned with ﬁnding housing
for students and maintaining up-

A to-date lists of available apart-

ments, the AWS Committee will
concentrate on suggesting meth-
ods of choosing apartments and
on ways of ﬁnding workable
arrangements of apartment liv-

‘ ing‘.

‘Miss Kleinberg stated that liv-
ing off-campus requires a dif-
ferent -set of skills than those
for living in the dorm.s or at
home. It is her commit-tee’s pur-
pose to acquaint people with
these skills.

-A -second project of the com-
mittee is to sponsor a talk sched-
uled for the fall by Captain
Charles Ray, head of the Uni-
versity’s Security Department.
His discussion will range from
house precautions to street safe-

ty measures. These are especial ,

ly important subjects since the

apartments areas near the Uni- Y

versity are poorly liglhted and
dangerous‘ to walk, day or night.

A long-range goal for the com-
mittee, according to Miss Klein-
berg, is to help in planning _Uni-
versity co-ops, that is, apart-‘
ment buildings owned by the
University for the use of stu-
dents.

The committee is getting its ‘

start this summer and welcomes
new members, noted the ’ chair-
man. Anyone interested in work-
ing on the cornmittee should
get in touch with Miss (Marcia

Buckbee of the Dean of Wom-'

en's office, 1209 CL.

Challenge

As Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar assumes the awesome duties of his
new role, he is confronted with a situation where his administration will
play the crucial role in determining thefuture of our University on almost
every count.

One of the most vital matters of concern in the attainment of a cosmo-
politan University is a satisfactory percentage of out-of-state students in
our total enrollment. Yet, as Dr. Posvar acknowledges, the lack_ of dormi-
tory space has forced out school to take a sizeable step backward and move
from the 70 to 30 percent ratio previously maintained to an approximate
80 to 20 ratio for this year’s incoming freshman class.

Werecognize the advantages in the highly competitive situation that

Pennsylvania students found themselves/in this year as they applied for

University admission. The high calibre of in-state students now attracted
our state—related University is encouraging, for it reinforces the value
of our affliation with the State.

However, the declining number of out-of-state students is an unfor-
tunate bypath that we are reluctant to accept. Our reluctance increases
as we acknowledge that it will be several years until the new dormitories
will be completed, and we will have to endure this unsatisfactory out-of-
state percentage until the added dorm space resolves the situation.

take a turn for the worse in the next few years ? Aren’t there any suitable
alternatives that will remedy this problem?

We feel that.it is a pressing obligation of our Administration, led by
our new Chancellor, to search for a means whereby students from other
regions and countries will be provided housing, even if we temporarily
establish wide-spread off-campus housing. Unless ways of maintaining a
satisfactory out-of-state ratio are thoroughly explored, it is unfair to
force our student body to accept this situation.

The students presently enrolled in our University should not be asked
to accept that their student body will be composed of almost entirely Penn-
sylvanians unless it is determined to the satisfaction of our University
community that we have no choice. As it now stands, we have been handed
an ultimatum and have not really been considered in any preliminary de-
cisions that paved the way for the establishment of that ultimatum.

We urge our Administration to set up a committee composd of admin-
istrators, faculty members, and students, for the express purpose of explor-
ing the alternatives, if any, that we have to the present situation of a de-
cline in out-of-state students. Unless the challenge is taken to meet the
problem of inadequate dorm space head-on and find alternative means of
housing our students until our dorms are built, our entire University com-
munity will suffer irreparably.

U.S. Must Aid Israel

TODAY THE world is clos-

fer to total war than at any

time since 1956.

In the fall of that year, Is-
rael, Britain and France, act-
ing upon Colonel Nasser’s
seizure of the Suez Canal,
launched an invasion of the
Sinai Peninsula.

Peace was restored main-
ly due to the efforts of the
United States which, as long
ago as 1950, had committed
itself to the preservation, of
territorial integrity in that
area of the ‘world. - »

TODAY THE American
government is faced with an-
other complex situation,
even more so than the one
which it faced 11 years ago.

When Nasser. seized ' con-
trol of the Straits of Tiran
and set up the blockade of

the Gulf of Aqaba he threat-

ened the very existence of
the State of Israel which
must live by the sea. Israeli
Premier Levi Eshkol label-
ed the action a belligerent

‘step and promised that Is-

rael would break the block-
ade.
. Had Israel struck at that

‘point, they would have won

an overwhelming victory. A
nation of two million would-
n’t seem to stand much of a
chance against the combined

might of 100 million Arabs, -

but Israel possesses many
advantages.

ISRAEL HAS always re-
lied upon her great mobility

and ﬂexibility and the light-

ing spirit of her people in
order to prevail ‘in any War
with the Arabs. Her total
forces of 270,000 (regulars
and reserves) can be mobil-
ized in a matter of hours,
and the army is built com-
pletely around the idea of
mobile ﬁrepower.

Added to this is the no-
torious lack of cohesion on

the _inferiority of their
of their armies.

But Israel did not strike
three weeks ago. She has
nothing to gain through war,
and with the urging of the
United States, she agreed to
let international diplomacy

»_-in the form of the United
Nations attempt to solve the

crisis; ’

THE PAST three weeks
has shown how. completely
bankrupt the arsenal of the
United Nations has been al-
lowed to become on matters
of crucial importance.

On Monday , Nasser attack-
ed Israel. The United Na-
tions is in session attempt-
ing to set up a cease-ﬁre sat-

isfactory to both sides. If

this fails. Israel will have no
alternative but to continue
the ﬁght against Arab ag-
gression. However, the cards
are not stacked. the way they
were three weeks ago. A lot
of reshuffling has gone on
in the meantime.

Arab armies are massed
along three of Israel's bor-

ders — Egypt, Syria, and

Jondan. Troops have been
flown in from Iraq and Ku-
wait to increase the size of
the «armies. Help has been
pledged from Algeria, Leb-
anon, Pakistan, Saudi Ara-
bia, the Sudan, and Yemen.

THIS ELIMINATES much

lofpthe former advantage ac-

crued Israel by her ability to
land the first blow. “In addi-
tion it divides her already
small forces into three
fronts.

While this military build-
up was occu.rrin_g,, political
fences among the Arabs were
being simultaneously mend-
ed. Nasser signed a defense
pact with former enemy Hus-
sein. The civil war in Yemen
has been stopped.

All of this has come about
as a result of Israel's faith

in the United States and. her
willingness to be patient.
What it angers for in the
event of. continued warfare
is more trouble than Israel
would have met earlier.

FACED WITH this dilem-
ma, the American govern-
ment is proceeding cautious-
ly. We are already engaged
in a land war in Asia and
have no desire to become in-
volved in another one.

But, four American pres-
dents have pledged theii.
support to Israel's mainten-
ence as a nation. These
pledges of support are clear
and cannot be misinterpret-
ed.

The war in Vietnam has
caused some dissention with-
in our nation. Some people
argue that we never should
have gotten involved; that
we‘ had no real committment.

THE GOVERNMENT ar-
gues that we do have a com-
mittment and we must hon-
or it. They insist that we
must stop the spread of com-_
munism and protect demo-
cracy. Whatever one’s per-
sonal feelings, there can be
no doubt that Vietnam is
clouded by ambiguities.

There are no such ambi-
guities in the Middle East.
The case is clear cut. Yet,
the American position in the

Guilt of Captain Levy?

An Ominous Beginning

by Paul Stoller

THE UNITED STATES has taken another step towards
achieving the authoritarian character of George Orwell’s,
1984. This step was taken last week when the United States
Army condemned Captain Howard Levy for making re-
marks concerning Vietnam that were considered a “calculat-
ed effort to undermine morale.”

In the Army's view, any enlisted man or officer can dis-
agree with the govermnent's foreign policy. Thus, Captain
Levy was justified in criticizing the Vietnam War. But ac-
cording to the Army prosecutor, Captain Levy tried to
“crush the spirit” of the enlisted men with violent criticism
f the war. Thus Levy was considered a subversive by the

rmy. . -

Charles E. Morgan, southern regional director of the
American Civil Liberties Union and Dr. Levy’s attorney
thought the charge of subversion was a shallow one. “If he's
a subversive, he's a pretty ineffective subversive,” said Mor-
gan. Homer Bigart’s writing for the New York Times, not-
ed that Morgan had said that the government had only pro-
duced 13 witnesses that testified to Levy's subversion.‘
“Thirteen witnesses produced out of a possible 12,500 (the
number of men that Levy had been in contact with) is
pretty ludicrous for a pattern of subversion,” Morgan point-
ed out.

NEVERTHELESS, THE 10 member military tribunal
found Levy guilty for willful disobedience and disloyal
statements. The ten member court sentenced Levy to three
years of hard labor. “He was also dismissed from the Army

and ordered to forfeit all pay and allowances,” according to . '

the New York Times. ‘

Captain Levy’s alleged guilt for making disloyal state-
ments has serious implications. It literally throws a clamp
on opinion in the armed forces. Thus, it virtually assures
the Army of the blind obedience of its future officers. In
any free soceity these assurances are dangerous.

The danger lies in the individual's right of dissent. Al-
though many of our current leaders deign to regard the
tradition of dissent, it is of key importance to the Ameri-

can future, and thus cannot be overlooked.

The Bill of Rights grants the individual the freedom
of speech. Yet, according to the slant of Army reasoning,
this does not apply to the Captain Levy. Thus, it’s all right
for any civilian to say what he wants. But when that
civilian gets into the Army he better watch what he says
and does.

ESSENTIALLY, THEN, the United States Army has
made itself a center for authoritarianism by finding Cap-
tain Levy guilty. -

Unfortunately, Levy can now be considered a semi-ma -
tyr to the cause of dissent. He was brave enough to stand
up for his principles. Now, he must pay.

Captain Levy is the victim of a grave injustice. Such
an injustice should not be tolerated in the United States——
the most democratic nation in the world.

AN CHORS AWAY!

There’s some of that traditional Naval Academy horse-
play at the Field House now that new wrestling coach Dave
Adams has opened his office.

Sportcoats wind up behind dusty ﬁling cabinets, a few
not-so-sporty ties are mysteriously “misplaced” in a wrong
closet, and the friendly bickering goes on and on and on.

Adams was Navy’s assistant wrestling coach last sea-
son, and after his appointment here last month, he found a
trio of ex-Annapolis coaches to greet him.

Dave Hart, Jim Royer and Bill Neal are currently in a
period of “relative relaxation” now that the football recruit-
ing task for the fall has been completed. But Adams’ re-
building of the anemic wrestling program has just begun.

HIS THREE Navy cronies have given him a head
start. Two of the freshman grid recruits also happen to
wrestle. Heavyweight Ralph Cindrich and 177 pounder Joe
Spicko were both tournament wrestlers in high school.

(Spicko incidentally, kicked a 52 yard ﬁeld goal last year.) -

Hart often makes sure Adamls doesn’t forget the help

-he’s gotten. “You can’t get recruits sitting on that chair,”

into Adams’ office. ,
Adams grins back -and
starts talking about his
prize recruit, Mark Payne.
He sold Payne on Pitt with-
out the aid of football staff,
and after being here for
‘barely a week himself.

PAYNE was last year’s

New York State champion
at 137 lbs. He finished the
season unbeaten, stringing
27 straight victories togeth-
er. Payne’s high school rec-
ord was 98-4, and he was the
runnerup in the state as a
sophomore. Adams enjoys
pointing out that Payne's in
the top 10% of his class, and
college board scores were
. . . 1397.

Adams admits he was lucky in getting Payne. “I had
been recruiting him for Navy,” he confided, “-but Mark
didn't want Annapolis. Then when I came here, I asked if
he would like to join me at Pitt. He had gotten to be a per-
sonal friend of mine, and if he had wanted Navy, I wouldn't
even have visited him. But he didn’t. He was confused over
all the offers.”

Adams’ personality wrested Payne from Oklahoma
State, Lehigh, Syracuse, and Michigan State, among others.

PERHAPS the announcement that Michigan’s Bob

Hart grins as he pokes his head

DAVE ADAMS

Fehrs, three-time runnerup in the NCAA finals at 123 lbs. i

would coach the freshman wrestling team made Adams’ job
easier. “Mark liked the idea of spending his first year under
Fehrs,” he said.

It's been awhile since Pitt’s had a freshman team and
Adams is doing everything he can to make sure he gets

one. “The Pennsylvania area is probably the best single area I
for wrestling in the country,” he claims. “Everybody re— A

cruits here. Pitt, Lehigh, _F& M, Penn State, the Service
Academies, and the Big Ten, to name a few.

“If there werejust two big schools here,” like in Okla-
homa, he continued, “say Pitt and Lehigh, we'd be national
champs every year.”

But Adams is realistic. So he's selling himself, educa-
tion and the future of Pitt wrestling to his prospectsf And
like his football buddies, he's getting results.

Tennis Team Notches First  
Winning Season Since 1962

by ART BOSENGARTEN

“They were a pretty dog-
gone ﬁghting team and they
had the spirit from the first

match on,” smiled coach Ben
Pope, referring to the 1967 ten-»
nis team. " I

“The boys were an alert, eager
group,” said Pope, “and it was
a pleasure -to be their coac .”

With new courts and a penna-
nent place to practice, the net-
ters came up with their first
winning season since 1962. They
ﬁnished the year with a 7-5-1
record.

After dropping their first three
matches, the netmen strung six
in a row. Pope blamed the early
losses on the weather which had
limited practice, but as the
weather improved so did the
netmcn.

The biggest match of the sea- _

son turned out to be the upset
of Bethany College, 6-3. Accord-
ing to Pope, “Bethany came into

the match feeling that they ,

couldn't be upset. The victory
was certainly a pleasant sur-
prise.”

The win snapped an 18-game
winning streak which had
stretched over two seasons. Also,
the netters’ ﬁrst singles man,
Bill Nichols, snapped another
Bethany streak. He ended a. 37
match skei-n of the Bisons num-
ber one man, Kirk Hunter.

SOCCER WIN

The varsity soccer team de-
feated the W110 celebrities
4-2 in an exhibition match Sat-
urday night. The hooters goals
(assists) were scored by Dave
Kozlell (Evangelo Stoyas),
Shelton Zvoma (Stoyas), Zvo-.
ma. (Mike Brourman) and Jeff
Heimberg (Stoyas) . Both WIIC
goals were “scored” by wrest-
lers carrying the ball into the
net at the end of the 15 mm-
ute game. Hurricane Hunt
scored on a. three yard plunge.
Batman scored twice on of!
tackle slants.

On the other side of the led-
ger, the greatest disappointment
of the season‘ was the loss to
Grove City, 5-4. “Grove City's
boys were a little more keyed-
np than our boys. They played
the best tennis of their season
against us,” said Pope.

Pope feels that “tennis is a
game of meticulous precision in
shot placement and one that re-
quires a tremendous amount of
conﬁdence." With this in mind,
Pope described his team as ‘be-
ing "50-50.”

He used this equation to chart
the play of the netmen. Three
of them, Nichols (.9-4). Bill Gold-
stein (7-5), and Erik Lieberman
(83), always played the same

_ consistent game. Tom Stromp
.1 (10-2) was “perfect in the num-

ber four slot,” said Pope, “but

needs more practice in order to
move up in the order.” Bob
Salaembier (7-5) and Elliot Sain-
er (5-7) had up and down sea-
sons.

The future looks bright for
the tennis team. »

Draft Deferments Studied

President Johnson recently
canceled plans for this fall’s col-
lege deferment tests in a move
preliminary to a decision on
whether to continue student de-
ferments. The following editori-
al from the State Press, Arizona
State University, Tempe, looks
at the pros and cons of the cur-

' rent and proposed draft sys-
terns.

To university students, the
most important of the far-reach-

_ .ing reforms proposed by the

President’s special. Commission
on the Selective Service is the
discontinuation of undergrad-
uate deferments. Thus students
would receive the same draft
consideration as factory work-

ers, ﬁle clerks, and ditch. dig- -

gers. Not surprisingly, this rec-
ommendation has not been met
with universal glee.

-The ‘question of «student de-
ferments is not black and white.
Both the present system and the
proposed reforms have advan-
tages. It is necessary, therefore,
to construct something of a bal-

’ once sheet.

On the credit side of the pre-
sent system is the protection
from the draft, at least tem-
porarily, of hundreds of stu-

= dents who -sincerely seek a high-

er education and have the abil-
ity to ‘make the most of it. The
military can offer them nothing,
and they can offer the military

 

tion is completed, his age makes
him more than ever ripe for
plucking. He is eager to begin
his career, but he is likely to be
drafted.

Second, the present system
encourages the hanger-on: the
guy who comes to school with
no intention of offering the uni-
versity anything and who takes
nothing from it except a diplo-
ma; the guy who makes it
through the graduation on the
skin of his teeth and his room-

mate's notes: the guy who shud-
ders every time he sees a uni-
form; the university parasite.

Since being a student will not
in itself offer any favorable con-
sideration from the draft -board,
the draft dodger will ﬁnd no
advantage in expending the min-
imum effort required to get
through school and thus will not
burden the university with his
presence. The loss will be the
gain of all sincerely dedicated
students.

To Be Posvar Aide ,

A new addition to the Chan-
cellor’s staff is Jack Freeman,
who will serve as Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar’s executive
assistant. Freeman, who has
worked in the Air Force Depart-

ment of the Pentagon for the ,

past three years, is a former
assistant professor of political
science at the Air Force Acad-
emy, where he worked closely
with Dr. Posvar.

When asked about -his new
position, Freeman replied, “It’s
a job that has not been in exis-
tcnce before. My job is essen-
tially to assist the Chancellor in
performing his job. I will be
respons-ible for coordinating
projects and activities and for
facilitating communications be-
tween the Chancellor and the
University.” .

In discussing what attracted
him to his new post, Freeman
commented, “I have great ad-
miraition for Dr. Posvar. He
needed someone who knew him
to work with him here. Also,

_ the ﬁeld of academics and aca-

demic administration presents a
challenging opportunity to me.”

Freeman received both his
bachelor's and master's degree
from Baylor University. In ad-
dition to teaching at the Air
Force Academy, Freeman taught
at the University of ‘Maryland
and Southern Colorado State
College.
