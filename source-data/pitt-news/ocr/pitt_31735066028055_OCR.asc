News Assistant

History and equality were two issues
agreed upon between opposing speak-
ers in last ’night’s debate_v,o_‘n.affirma-
tive action. .

Both sides said minorities have been
treated unfairly in the past and contin-
ue -to face obstacles due to their gen-
der or skin color.

But while former attorney general
Edwin Meese said he believes
inequality is wrong, he doesn't see
affirmative action as the solution to
the problem. He said that's the job of
laws like the civil rights amendment.

“I also favor affirmative action as it
was originally applied. But it now
goes against the grain of society
because of its unfairness,” said Meese.
“It has been corrupted into a system of
preference and discrimination. The
solution is to actively enforce the laws
already in place.”

His opponent, Betty Shabazz,
widow of Malcolm X, agreed that
laws have been created to enforce

Edwin Meese and Betty Shabbaz share their views during an Affirmative
Action debate in the William Pitt Ballroom.

Clash of opinons on
Affirmative Action

equality, but that laws are not the end-

all to equality and minorities must

continue to fight for their basic rights.
“A lot of people who look like

myself are not paid adequate salaries, M

are not granted admission to universi-
ties and schools of higher education
due to the color of their skin. Where is
the preferential treatment?”

Meese countered by saying that

- affirmative action’s set quotas and

preferential treatment is again not the
answer. In fact, he said it only aggra-
vates the problem.

“Discrimination in any form is
wrong. Quotas violate the fundamen-
tal principles of our society,” said
Meese. “And they often hurt those
they attempt to help, like those
minorities who reach their goals
through their own achievements.”

Shabazz said affirmative action laws
leave room’ for amendment, but should
not be eliminated. She believes it
should smooth the bridge from the
pastof slavery and inequality to the
future of freedom and equal rights.

Sentence in
the beating of
Pitt student

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

An 18-year old, who along with four
others beat a Pitt student into a coma last
January, was sentenced to three to 10
years in jail. 5

Timothy Craddock, 18, pleaded guilty
to aggravated assault and conspiracy, in
addition to. identifying the other attackers.

David Orsborn, a junior film studies
major at the time, was knocked uncon-
scious when Craddock and four others
kicked and punched him on the steps of
the Towers.

While Orsborn was being attacked,
around 11 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 13, Pitt
students were walking up and down the
steps. They had to maneuver around
Orsborn and his attackers to get up the
steps.

Eventually, Orsborn was thrown down
to the bottom of the steps, his head bang-
ing on each one, where he was found by
an eyewitness who found police officers.

Orsborn was taken to Presbyterian
University Hospital where he remained in
a coma for five days. He suffered facial
fractures and a severe concussion in the
attack.

After leaving the hospital, Orsborn went
through rehabilitation near his hometown
of Downingtown, Pa., for about six
months. ‘

Currently, Orsborn walks with a limp on
his left leg and has numbness on the left
side of his body.

Allegheny county Common Pleas Judge

Jeffrey Manning sentenced Craddock and
said it was a senseless, vicious act of vio-
lence.
P Three of the attackers were juveniles
and two of them, a 14- and a 15-year-old,
were found delinquent in juvenile court.
Charges were dropped against the third
juvenile .and the other adult, Toby
Ekunfeo, because of a lack of evidence.

Craddock apologized to the judge and
said he was drunk and didn't remember

Pitt Professor saves kids, wins Heinz award

By Christopher Lawrence
Staff Writer '

If you’ve ever put unleaded
‘gasoline into your car or used
interior paint toirefurbish your
bedroom, you’ve benefitted
from the work of Herbert
Needleman.

Needleman, a pediatrician and
child psychologist at the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, has spent the
last 40 years trying to eliminate

. products containing lead from
the market.

In a ceremony in Washington
last Thursday, Needleman’s

years of hard work were hon-

ored by Teresa Heinz as she
awarded him the $250,000
Heinz Award in Environment.

The Heinz Awards were creat-
ed last year in memory of Sen.
John Heinz, who died in an air-
plane crash in 1991.

Needleman received the
award for his contributions to
the understanding. and preven-
tion of childhood lead poison-
mg.

His Lead Exposure Study,
which began at Harvard Medical
School in the 1970s, produced
the ﬁrst evidence that low-level

exposure to lead could affect a

child’s IQ score. The continuing
study has shown that lead expo-

sure can cause attentional dys-
function, reading problems,

. speech problems and anti-social

behavior.

Needleman was instrumental
in decisions by the federal gov-
ernment to remove lead from
gasoline, to ban lead from interi-
or paints and to remove lead
from thousands of housing units
across the country.

The results of his work have
been dramatic. According to one
estimate, the average amount of
lead found in blood levels in the
United States has dropped 78
percent since 1976.

Needleman’s successes
haven't come without controver-

‘sy. In 1992, he was accused of

scientiﬁc fraud and misconduct
in his study.

An inquiry by a Pitt hearing
board exonerated him of all
wrongdoing, but he's still a fre-
quent target of criticism by the
lead industry.

“The only people who take
the misconduct charges serious-
ly are people in the lead indus-
try,” Needleman said.

As a result of the accusations
brought against him, Needleman
fought for and won the right for
those accused of such charges to
have an open hearing with legal
representation.

Congress gets a week to balance budget

World Events

BRUSSELS — Nearly three
decades after Charles de
Gaulle pulled France from

_ NATO’s military command,

the country announced on

Tuesday that it would resume

active participation in the
alliance’s military wing effec-
tive immediately.‘

The decision came as
NATO officers approved the
deployment of about 60,000
troops to enforce the peace in
Bosnia, the country where
French visions of European
emancipation from American
political leadership were
proven empty in more than
three years of fighting.

France has arranged to send
its defense minister to future
NATO meetings and to rejoin
the alliance’s military com-
mittee — recognizing that

 any European force will
' evolve within the alliance

rather than outside it.

MOSCOW — Three children
were killed and three injured
when a ransom-seeker who
took 56 children hostage at a
kindergarten on Tuesday
responded to a rescue attempt
by releasing two grenades.

It happened in Vladikavkaz,
a city in southern Russia’s
North Caucasus region that
has been subject to a string of
hostage situations. 2

A second attack took place
at the door of a parliament
office of an extremist nation-
alist lawmaker. There were no
injuries in the attack, which,
according to Parliament offi-
cials, is suspected to come
from a home-made bomb.

WASHINGTON The
White House said on Tuesday
that it would give Congress a
week to propose a plan that

would erase the federal
deficit in seven years, and
offered a detailed description
of how it would limit project-
ed spending on Medicare, one
of the most crucial issues at
hand. 0

The action was a genuine, if
small, sign of motion in a

political lock that has man- E

aged to block a balanced-bud-
get accord for almost one
yean

But as budget talks resumed
on the same day, following a
bitter five"-day face-off, nego-
tiators for both players con-
tinued to charge that it was
the other blocking the agree-
ment. Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

WASHINGTON — After
already sharply curbing the
creation of voting districts
designed to benefit minori-
ties, The Supreme Court may
be willing to pull the reins
even tighter.

The court’s conservative
justices looked skeptical of
the validity of five Texas and
North Carolina congressional
districts. Civil rights advo-
cates expressed pessimism
about the outcome.

They fear a conservative
ruling will slash minority rep-
resentation not only in
Congress, but across the
political scope. A decision is
expected in July. Pittsburgh

This is a test-run period
for the online issues, so we
encourage you to take a

look at _our web site and e— e

mail us with any sugges-
tions. This way we can

Sometimes newspapers
are limited by space.
Stories have to be short-
ened, and letters to the edi-
tor don’t make. it into print
as quickly as the staff

would like. But the
Internet doesn’t have that
problem.

Because of the laclg of
space constraints, you will
probably see things in the
online edition that didn’t
make it into the paper,
which gives the editors

more freedom in giving
the readership what they

“I’m still waiting to be paid
the wages my forefathers
earned,” said Shabazz.
“Some people don’t under-
stand history and want to
eliminate affirmative action.
It is a vehicle for blacks to
regain what their forefathers
rightly earned. Amend it,
yes. Eliminate it, no.”

Meese again returned to the
original idea of affirmative
action. He said its initial
intent, introduced by
President Linden Johnson in
1965, was as step toward
removing discrimination
from the workplace. It was to
be a way to expand recruit-
ment. '

“It was not intended to use
quotas nor wasit to give
preference to any one or two
groups,” said Meese. “And in
today’s form that it was it
does.”

In terms of the effect affir-
mative action plays on edu-
cation, Shabazz agreed that
although a lot of money is
put into recruitment, colleges
and universities don’t house
the resources to keep the stu-
dents in school once they’re
accepted.

Here at Pitt, two scholar-
ships directly target African-
American students. The
Challenge scholarships are
offered to more than 40 stu-
dents based on academic
achievement. Although

_they’re based on merit, the

amount awarded is based on
financial need.

The Helen Faison scholar-
ships are awarded to five
African American students
each year and provides full
tuition, room and board. As
far as Pitt is concerned, it is
primarily through the vehicle
of recruitment that they seek
to achieve affirmative action
goals.

Opinions
No fear of justice

Do you know who Timothy Craddock is? At least one for-
mer Pitt student will never forget — David Orsborn.

Craddock was one of the four or five men who beat Orsborn

into a coma last January. It happened right on the Towers
steps with a lot of people just walking past or watching.

Thanks to Craddock and his buddies, Orsborn’s jaw was
crushed and his cheekbones broken. He will never see out of
both eyes properly again. Orsborn also had a blood clot in
his brain. Thanks to Craddock, et al, he only has use of 90
percent of his brain.

And thanks to the justice system, one of the men responsi-
ble for changing Orsborn’s life forever will only spend 18
months in jail. _

Craddock was sentenced Tuesday to 3-10 years in prison. It
is highly likely, however, that he will be released on parole
in 18 months. (Convicted criminals are only required to serve

. a fraction of their minimum sentence before becoming eligi-

ble for parole.) Whether you view prison as a place for reha-
bilitation or deterrence, that is not enough.

The justice system has been continually lax in sentencing
violent criminals. Craddock received such a light sentence
because he is only 18 and a first-time offender. While the
three-strikes-you’re-out rule might be good in keeping vio-
lent criminals off the streets for good, what happens if you
are one of the first two strikes? What if you are someone’s
“first offense” and your attacker walks out of jail in 18
months?

If you are one of the people who thinks this could never
happen to you, fine. What if it is your sister or mother? Or
one of your children? A first offense is no less violent than a
third, fifth orhundredth. David Orsbom will not regain the
life he had last year because this was Craddock’s first
offense. Violent criminals should not be given leniency
because they never committed a violent crime before (or at

. least never got caught).

Another reason Craddock received such a light sentence
was because he testified against the other men involved in

O the beating. The message this sends is that if you want to do

something wrong, do it with friends, then rat them out. This
is almost guaranteed to get you a lighter sentence if not made
immune for prosecution; So next time you want to hold up a
bank, bring that sort-of-annoying friend along for the ride.

Two of the other men involved in the beating were tried as
juveniles and will probably spend a few years (at most) in
Schumann Detention Center. A third man was released
because Craddock’s testimony against him did not prove
anything conclusively. ' ,

It is time for the justice system to be re-evaluated.
Everyone loves to complain about increasing crime and esca-
lating violence. One of the causes behind those increases is
that the justice system poses little threat to criminals.
Citizens who do nothing wrong have everything to fear from
someone who might get bored or drunk‘ and beat them to
death, but criminals have nothing to fear as a result of their
actions. ‘

The long and grinding road

Well, here we are again —
ﬁnals time. One more week and

another term bites the dust. -

Some of the more fortunate stu-
dents can leave this weekend
and enjoy an extra seven days of
vacation. Then again, there are
also some poor souls who will
be trapped in the all-encompass-
ing gloom and doom that per-
vades the halls of this university
until next Saturday. (Feel free to
try and guess which group I fall
into.) 

Regardless of when you get to
leave, the fact remains that all
Pitt students must eventually go.
You have no choice in the mat-
ter, seeing as the university shuts
down the residence halls until
Jan. 2. While I can’t be sure
what the rest of you will be
doing, I think I have a pretty
good idea -— you’re going
home. I know I am. Which
brings me to the point of this
column. ’

Travelling home can be rough
sometimes. Believe me, I know.
I live roughly seven hours away
(OK, so maybe it’s more like six
since they raised the speed limit
to 65, which means I drive at
somewhere between 70 and 75
— but that’s not the point here.)
Anyway, I had a little adventure
when I left for Thanksgiving
which I will relate as brieﬂy as
possible before I get back to my
“leaving for Christmas” theme.

Needless to say, I was dozing
off before I was even halfway
home. So, at 1:30 a.m. I pulled
into one of the numerous rest-
stop/gas station/restaurants that
line the marvelous Pennsylvania
Turnpike. Once inside, I headed
straight for the gift shop and
picked up a package of No-
Sleep pills, (Why the rest stop
has a gift shop is beyond me, but
in this case I’m glad they did.)

In case you’ve never taken a
sleep-retardant_ pill, let me

describe the feelings they instill -

in you. The ﬁrst hour after you
takeone you’re relatively ﬁne.
You remember all of the words
to the songs on the radio, and

Christopher 8
Lawrence

you cease having to struggle to
keep your eyes open.

The next few hours are when
things start to get screwy. I call
this stage “Heightened
Awareness.” After Heightened
Awareness, you reach the final
stage of the No-Sleep experi-
ence, the part of the caffeine-
induced trip when you think
you’re God. I’m not kidding,
this actually happens. You
become omniscient. You see all,
hear all, feel all. Your ﬁve sens-
es merge together and form a
black hole —— nothing escapes
you. It’s like Heightened
Awareness to the nth degree.
(This may sound cool, but 10
hours of listening to your own
heartbeat is enough to drive
even‘God_insane.)

Now that I’ve (hopefully)
warned you of No-Sleep pills,
I’d like to suggest a few more
natural ways to stay awake.

First, kidnap someone and
drag them along for the ride. If
the trip is longer than three
hours, kidnap two people. (It’s
my experience that most folks
start to doze off at the two-and-
a—half hour mark.) Having two
people with you allows you to
establish a system — one person
sleeps while the other entertains
you.

If kidnapping is against your
religion and you wind up travel-
ling alone, I suggest you find
some cassettes or CDs and bring
them along. Pop one in the
machine, crank up the volume
and sing.

Sing loudly.

Scream if you have to. (It’s
amazing how a really sore throat
can keep you awake.)

Note: Make sure the only
music you have with you is up-
tempo and totally free of all
emotional attachment. The last
thing you need is to hear a
romantic ballad that reminds
you of your special someone.
Your mind will hearken back to

some glorious moment in your
relationship, you’ll close your
eyes (bad sign), begin to sigh
and BOOM! You and your car
have just become the hood orna-
ment on a tractor trailer that’s
heading back to the ‘Burgh.

My next suggestion is for
those of you who will be head-
ing east on the Turnpike. If
you’re going as far as I am (i.e.
the glorious state of New
Jersey), you’ll pass through four

tunnels. Five, if you count the i

one in Squirrel Hill. So here’s
my idea .—— hold your breath
when you pass through them.
I’m not sure whether or not it’s a

proven scientific fact, but I've -

found that cutting oﬁ’ the oxygen
to your brain for the amount of
time it takes to drive through a
tunnel really gets your adrena-
line pumping —— when your
adrenaline is up, so are your
eyelids.

Another note: if, for some
strange reason, there’s a traffic
jam and you’re moving through
the tunnel at 3 m.p.h., do NOT
try the hold-your-breath

approach. It won’t work.

Suggestion number three.
Open your window. According
to the folks at Telefact, the aver-
age daily temperature in
Pittsburgh in December is 31
degrees. If you roll down your
window and let the icy breeze
strike your hands and face,
you’ll stay awake. Of course,
you’ll also feel a little bit of
pain. Don’t worry though, once
the frostbite sets in, everything
will get numb.

Of course you could always
try drinking coffee or soda, but
then the odds are good that
you’ll have to use one of those
Turnpike stop restrooms. And
who knows where that might
lead.

Hopefully you’ll decide to use
one of these methods to keep
you awake on your ride home.
As for me ... I’m ﬂying.

a brush. Girl woner $§§§ﬁ§°§E §®§§%”§° tries not to get pissed on.’

Upon entering the studio of The Fab
Factory, I found primitive paintings deco-
rating the walls and enormous
silkscreens of pop-culture icons hiding
the peeling paint. Various tribal nudes
and finger—painted canvases hung
around the room. Racks of colorful
clothes lined one of the walls.

I peered around the corner and found
Karl Mullen rubbing cigarette ashes on
paper. Mullen greeted me with his deep
Irish accent that echoed in the air as cig-
arette smoke escaped his lips.

‘‘I am making rubbings out of my

1 ashes and burns. I need to smoke 75 of

them to make this series,” Mullen
explains. He was submitting a series of

burnt pictures that featured primitive.

cave images to Transmission magazine.
Before he sent the rubbings to the mag-
azine, he pissed on them. Three weeks

later he was Transmission’s featured
artist.

Mullen walked me around the room,
pointing out cowhide impressions of his
face, finger paintings on old advertising
layouts, experimental T-shirts and even
pressed mushroom mush. I cringed as
he showed me bottles of sausages he
had pissed in and let ferment for years.

' Mullen had used every possible material

to express himself in ways that chal-
lenge a viewer's deﬁnition of art.

The most exciting and avant-garde
pieces are his body prints. ‘‘I use my
body, my-blood, my semen in many
pieces," Mullen said. Mullen abandons
the convention of brushes and pallettes
to use his own anatomy as tools. The
body becomes a ‘Living Brush’ that
directs and captures personal impres-
sions. Influenced by French artist Yves
Klein, Mullen and fellow nudes paint
their bodies and lie on canvases. The
marks left by the painted flesh are erotic
and tantalizing. Mullen invites people
with open minds to explore every aspect
of the self as a work of art.

“Someone asked me what I think art

should be like and I said, ‘it should be I

everywhere and everything,”’ Mullen
remarked. “Even the cups we drink out
of should be art.” That is exactly what
Karl and his companions have done with
places such as Mad Mex and Kaya.
They are hired to metamorphose the
spaces into fresh innovative atmos-
pheres for young businesses. New
enterprising owners are attracted to
Mullen’s colorful use of materials and

‘ inventive decorations. The Fab Factory

has only been around for five months
and has already uplifted restaurants,
bars, coffee houses and adorned art-
work for rock’n roll groups.

The free-flowing images can be
admired in intimate places such as bath-
rooms. Kaya contracted‘ The Fab
Factory to transform their bathrooms
into Caribbean tribal sanctuaries. The‘

sexuality of these figures are exaggerat-
ed in loud colors and fill the room with
their presence. They cover every aspect
of a place so well that it’s hard to deter-
mine whether to use the toilet oradmire
it.

The Fab Factory’s biggest commodity
is their T-shirt business. Alex Hutnik,
Mullen’s partner, uses his energy to pro-
duce original and experimental designs
for T-shirts. Various establishments
ranging from lnka Dinka Doo Tattoo
Shop to Blue Duck Records adorn their
employees and followers with classy
modern logos that The Fab Factory can
provide.

  
   

“Things are getting too high tech, and
perfect. This leads to a crave for crafts
like quilts,” Hutnik says.

“People don't want white T-shirts so
we give them experimental originals,”
Mullen said.

Their Monongahela Mud Shirts come
from actual mud taken from the river
which is used to tie-dye shirt patterns.
Body printed T-Shirts are also part of
their creative tinkering. Tattoo parlors

and new store owners adorn themselves
with these crafty looks because they
resemble the freshness of the surfacing
art community.

“We want to be catalysts for artists,”
Mullen explains. The Fab Factory uses
poets, photographers, songwriters and
musicians when working on projects. In
November, The Factory brought these
peop|e'together in a Fashion Flux Show
at Rosebud. They transformed the entire
atmosphere into a gallery of culture and
expression. Poetscrecited pieces and

albums of the year. Of course,

some
may disagree like some gener-
ally do; if so, convince me of my
“error,” and give propers where
they're due. Remember, they
are in no particular order: ‘

1. Mobb Deep —— The
Infamous. These kids repre-
sentin’ the Queensbridge pro-
jects went from “Hit It From The
Back” in '92, to “Shook Ones,
pts. I & II” in ‘94 to spring one of
the tightest albums ever.
(“Survival Of The Fittest,” “Eye
For An Eye,” “Trife Life”)

2. Raekwon The Chef —
Only Built For Cuban Linx 
Another chamber of the infa-
mous Wu Tang Clan freaks
Shaolin techniques with his
partner Tony Starks to open the
masses like clams to retrieve
the pearl. (“Gui|Iotines,” “VerbaI
lntercourse,” “Ice Cream”)

3. Ol’ Dirty Bastard —
Return To The 36 Chambers:
The Dirty Version. The most
twisted chamber of t_he Wu hits
from the back right side of the
head with flave that spins you
360 degrees beforeyou come
around to believe his shit
explodes. (“Brooklyn Zoo,” “The

harcyde —
Labcabincalifornia.
Slept like Posturepedic the first
time around, these four kids
from L.A. bring it to ya raw once
again to get the props they
deserve. (“Runaway”)

5. Fat Joe — Jealous One’s
Envy. Honestly, I couldn’t
believe when I heard it. The Fat
one has finally lived up to his
name and brought it to us like
his image projects. Tight tracks
and rhymes. (“Success,” “Shit
Is Real rmx”),

6. Onyx — All We Got Iz Us.
With a self-produced sopho-
more effort, the screaming trio
brings it real and keeps it raw
for those that didn’t believe they
couldn’t do it again. Minus one
member, they still stand strong
and maintain for real. (“Live,”

“Wa|k In New York," “Last I

Days”)

7. Erick Sermon — Double
Or Nothing. Good flavor just
perpetuates; ask the ring leader
of the Def Squad. No lame
excuses about him using the
same samples this time; it’s all

buttah flave for the nine-sex. So ‘

what's next? (“Bomdigi,” “Open
Fire,” “Focus”)

8. Mic Geronimo — The
Natural. The long-awaited,
highly anticipated debut from
the Queens native lives up to
expectations to quench the pal-
let of the thirsting underground
hip-hop hedz that were left
open after “The Shit’s Real.”
(“Wherever You Are,” “Masta
I.~C. rmx feat. The Lost Boyz,”
“Time To Build”)

9. GeniuslGZA — Liquid
Swords. The Wu "general
returns with his long overdue
sophomore joint to add more
ammo to the chambers. A ver-
bal warrior that very few can
touch. Definitely one for the
thinker. (“Labels,” “Shadow
Boxin’,” “Duel Of The Iron Mic”)

10. L.L. Cool J _—- Mr. Smith.

On the sixth revolution, L.L.

brings it back to the essence of
his roots; raw flows and tongue-
and-cheek wordplay. At times,

he's very smooth, but not at all -

to be fucked wit’ kids. (“I Shot
Ya rmx,” “No Airplay,” ‘‘Doin’ It’’)

The “close, but no blunts”
awards go to:

1. KRS One —-- KRS One.
The joint’s tight, but the more
you listen, the more staying
power it loses. He does have
some buttas on there.
(“Represent The Real Hip Hop,”
“Build Ya Ski|Iz,” “Rappaz R N
Dainja”)

2. Das EFX — Hold It Down.
Definitely a step up from
Straight Up Sewaside, but
nowhere near the first album at
all. Although Books outshines
Dray on this one, flave can defi-
nitely be found. (“Buck Buck,”
“Comin’ Thru,” “Hold It Down,”
“Real Hip Hop”)

._    I by‘ p. d. williams

' New Jersey really hasn't written a chap-

ter in the rock n’ roll story. Well there's
Hoboken, which has put a footnote in the . -

story,_with bands like Yo La Tengo and the ‘

seminal venue, Maxwell's. However,
Hoboken is a suburb of New York City
and will be the alternative living arrange-
ment to Manhattan. Now, ou can search
elsewhere for a element o rock.

In last two years, the band Spent (from
New Jersey) has been poking through the
shellof rock community. Merge records
signedthem, and now New Jersey isn't
just a rest stop on the way to -New York.
Spent’s latest album, Songs of Drinking
and Rebellion, sounds like an introspective
of New Jersey life." The music is a subtle
blend of rock_and folk with indie-rock pop‘
elements. 4 ' _

Jim W‘ilbur_ of Superchunk said,
”Sometimes they get to get together to
practice but wind up drinking whiskey and
playing Scrabble instead.” This sounds like
a new drinking game. ”John took a photo-

graph of a guy who was throwing .up.
Ann joined a, band after they heard her
singing  the shower. Ed throws a party
every time something goes wrong in his
life. And Joe went on a date with a girl
once but didn't realize it ’til years _later,"g
said Wilbur. J ' -

Tonight! Bloomfield Bridge Tavern 9 p.m.
$5. Spent, with opening bands Sarastatic
and The Now Diversion (members of Tiny
Little Help). J '

Hearing The Johnsons’ live appearance
on WPTS’ local show, I found their music

‘almost inspirational. Their music is a mon-

tage of a creative upswing with ballads
using acoustic guitars, a stripped-down
drum set and a violinist, that draws tradi-
tions from folk and Johnny Cash's country
poems. A must see! Opening are Hellbelly
at Lascaux Gallery above‘ City Books on
the South Side. Friday, 9 p.m. A .

Tasty likeibittersweet sugar packs, i

Blindsight and The Blackwells will be play-
ing at the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern,
Friday, 10 p.m. - »

If you do want to drink, appoint a designated driver
who'll remain sober to drive everybody home.
Or, stay over where you're partying.

Or, call a cab to get you home.

We want to see you happy and healthy in '96!

hat all goes into the
pregame preparation
for a college basket-

ball player? Coaches give the
pep talk, trainers wrap the
ankles and the always snappy
team theme- clap makes its
way from the locker room to
the tunnel and ﬁnally to the
floor. There is something odd,
however, that has caught my
eye lately as I ingest the ﬂood
of basketball games each and

_ every night.

On-court fashion has
become as much a staple as
the snot-nosed coaches’
nephews whowipe up the
ﬂoor during time outs. All
you have to do is turn on the
TV between 7 and 11 p.m. on
any given night (noon and
midnight on the weekends)
and you will catch what the
‘‘cool’’ players are wearing.

It all started a few years
back when sneakers began
their downward trend. A
pump here and some Velcro
there, and you’ve got yourself
a $100 price tag. Luckily for
these disadvantaged student-
athletes, the footwear comes
free of charge. Whew!

With coaches signing fat
shoe deals, the players are all
forced to wear the same
sneaks. This is a good idea --
everyone’s attire is the same
from head to toe andthe team
looks smooth regardless of its
talent. Throw in a sharp suit
for the coach, and it doesn’t
matter how the team plays the
game —— they look ﬂy.

The players stuck with this
conformity for a while, but
they soon became fed up with
having their foot fashion-
sense stiﬂed. Who can blame
them? Shoes are the lifeblood
of sports as we know them
today.

OK, if the coach is pocket-
ing some moolah and making
commercials, I guess he can
tell them what brand to lace -
up. What they failed to
remember is that the feet are
only about 5 percent of their
bodies. _

Enter the baggy shorts. .

Pitt loses Big East pene

By Brad Isles    
SportsEditor , j — ; P

  

High percentage shots weren’t the problem in Pitt’s game against 0 ..
Boston College last night. The problem was shooting percentage. 

The Panthers (1-2, 0-1) dropped their ﬁrst Big East game of the sea- 
son 55-53 at Chestnut Hill, ﬁnishing the game shooting 33 percent  .
from the ﬁeld It was the Eagles’ (4-1, 1-1) second-straight conference f 
victory. .  3, .

“If we don’t shoot better [from three] we’re going to see a lot of  i 3'
zone,” coach Ralph Willard said. “We’ve got guys who have shot it — 
andcan shoot it, we’re just not making it.”  _ .

Despite shooting 29 percent in the second half, the Panthers were  *
able to keep it close. '

Jerry McCullough’s layup with a minute left in the game cut BC’s —
lead to one at 52-51. After two Danya Abrams foul shots, Jason Maﬂe
knocked down a jumper from the right wing keeping the Panthers :
within one. _ 

With 24 seconds left, Maile and McCullough had Duane Woodward -
trapped at halfcourt. But Maile got a piece of Woodward’s arm on-a
steal attempt Woodward made one of his two free throw attempts, giv- 3
ing BC a 55-53 advantage. ‘

On the inbound, McCullough pushed the ball up the court and
passed off to Andre Alridge, who was whistled for travelling with
seven seconds to go. -

“You need to make plays at that time, and we didn’t make them,”
Willard said. “That’s_another vestige of experience. Hopefully, we’ll : .
learn from this and get better.” ,-

The Big East opener for Pitt started out with forward Chad Varga i
trading baskets with BC the ﬁrst four-and-a-half minutes of the game.
He scored Pitt’s ﬁrst seven points, and his driving layup at the 15:30
mark gave the Panthers a 7-5 lead.

But BC countered with an 11-0 run over the next 3:20, increasing i , _
lead to 16-7. Antonio Granger sparked the run, nailing a three from the agamst B°St°“ (3011339-
top of the key and then stealing Pitt’s attempted inbound pass. He got halftime. ‘

ts Jerry McCullough had eight points and two assists last night

fouled and made one of two from the free throw line. Maile missed a
three, and Abrams converted a three-point play "after being fouled by
Mark Blount. Abrams led all scorers with 17, while grabbing 11
boards. ‘ - —

Pitt connected on only two of 15 attempts from behind the three
point line. .

“That’s tough to put a handle on,” Willard said. “But we’re not
shooting the ball well right now, and I think that comes down to spac-
ing and conﬁdence. It’s something we’ll have to keep working on.”

After a time out, Pitt came out in a 2-2-1 press and got itself back in
the game with a quick 6-0 run, cashing in on two BC turnovers. ‘

The Eagles ﬁnished the game with 21 tumovers.

“We did a lot of good things defensively,” Wrﬂard said, “things that
if you have a decent night offensively, you’re going to win the basket-

ball game. We’ ve got to ﬁnish plays, and right now we’ re not doing it.” '

The Panthers took their second lead of the game at 23-22 late in the

Along with shooting poorly from the outside, Pitt was miserable on
the inside, missing numerous layups and tip-ins. The Panthers shot 38
percent from the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst half.

“We didn’t ﬁnish inside,” Willard said. “We had a lot of great oppor-
tunities inside that we didn’t ﬁnish. That and the outside shooting were
the telling tale.” -

Varga finished the game as Pitt’s top scorer with 16, adding nine
rebounds. But he slowed down in the second, only scoring three points.
Gerald Jordan picked up Varga’s slack in the second, with eight of his
14 coming in the period.

BC came out in the second half and regained the lead at 31-27. The
Panthers held it close on four Jordan foul shots, the fourth giving Pitt its
last lead of the game at 38-37. A

Abrams picked up his fourth foul at the 15:16 mark of the second,
but Pitt couldn’t capitalize in the 11 minutes he spent on the bench,
mainly because of Mickey Curley. He had four blocks and grabbed six

fnst on a Blount jumper. Pitt held on to take a 25-24 lead going into

(Ea'it0r’s Note: This is part
two ofa two-part series on
the new Pitt athletic facilities
and their affect on recruit-

ing. )

The University of
Pittsburgh continues to work
on the eight-phase renovation
plan for the severely outdated
Pitt Stadium. Hopefully,
according to Pitt’s sports hier-

archy, the renovations will g

help Pitt turn the corner in the
revenue sports, particularly
football.

Phase 2 deals with the reno-
vation of the old locker rooms
vacated when the new rooms
were built. Renovation of the
old equipment, weight and

training areas will be done as
well. These places will turn
into a new, smaller but better,
visiting team locker room and
a band program facility.

The band program facility,
the first of its kind for Pitt,
will include offices and prac-
tice rooms.

The estimated cost of Phase
2 stands around $1,250,000.

Phase 3 plans to build new
football offices on Level C,
the level where all the play-
ers’ facilities are located. The
entrance to these offices will
be adjacent to Gate 2. There
will also be new team meet-
ing rooms, the ever—important
recruiting offices, and a play-
ers’ lounge. Speculation is
that a Pitt Hall of Fame will
be included in this phase. _

The estimated cost for com-

Phase 4 is the least expen-

one. For $224,000, the vacat-

converted into an interim aca-
demic support area. .

“Young student-athletes
want a pleasant environment,”
Pitt athletic director Oval
Jaynes said. “Of course, this
plan is for the improvement
of our athletic facilities, but,
also we are looking to benefit
the student in student-athlete

B into the Athletic

P Stadium iacilily project increases recruiting competitiveness

seen outside the stadium
through windows. The esti-
mated cost is $1,107,000.

The total estimated cost of
these stadium renovations
comes to approximately $20
million.

“To achieve our goals of
restoring Pitt’s football suc-
cess,” head football coach
Johnny Majors said, “we must
build a football facilities com-
plex that will have an imme-
diate, positive and dramatic
impact.”

Another addition to the
Second Century Fund is a
possibility of a reception area
for alumni. The reception area
would be on the opposite side
of the student section and will
have windows looking out on
the field. The area will be
near the field level.

So far, Pitt has achieved
moderate success last year
and in the first phase of this
year’s recruiting season.

Last year Pitt’s class ranked
in the top 25 in the nation in
many recruiting polls. Players
such as running back
Demetrius Harris, linebacker
Phillip Clarke, defensive back
Rasshad Whitmill and the Big
East’s first-team placekicker
Chris’ Ferencik were all inte-
gral parts of Pitt’s 2-9 season.

These players said they
came to Pitt for two reasons:
the expectation to play early
and because of Pitt’s renewed
commitment to turn the pro-
gram around.

Through this recruiting sea-
son, Pitt is off to a good start.
Ten players have committed
to Pitt, with the most bally—
hooed being Penn Trafford
quarterback Tony

. Zimmerman, the subject of a

large Sports Illustrated fea-
ture.

Recently, the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette released its
annual Fab 22. The Fab 22
consists of the 22 best foot-
ball players from Western
Pennsylvania. To this point,
seven of these players have
committed to play football at
Pitt.

“We want to provide the
young people a pleasant
atmosphere, and the people
who have committed so far
have made a difference,”
Jaynes said.

With Pitt’s horrendous
decline in football over the
last six seasons, the difference
will be if these new facilities
at Pitt Stadium can bring the
top-notch recruits that have
eluded this university.

of large drawers back in 1992.
Corliss Williamson and Scotty
Thurman pushed the envelope
a little too far and created a
monster.

The Fab Five up in
Michigan were the first to don
the black Nike socks that went
in their black Nike shoes that
complemented their shimmer-
ing Nike jerseys that were
neatly tucked into their calf-
length Nike shorts. There it
was, the versatile mallrat out-
fit that could double as bas-
ketball garb.

Allen Iverson was about 16
when these fashion gurus
made their mark, and he knew
his day would come sooner or
later. He would be strolling
down the catwalk, and he’d
best be ready.

All he came up with was the
cut-off undershirt, but like
tightrolls in blue jeans, this
tacky trend spread like wild-
fire. Addthe a1ways-too-
small-to-distinguish bicep tat-
too, and you’re dressed to kill.

All that remains is the head.
There seems to be little cre-
ative liberty for basketball
players and their skulls, but
some have been trying their
hardest. How about every-
body shaves their head? No
can do — not many white
guys look good with a smooth
skull. What about goatees? A
Strike two — can’t see Kevin
Willard with facial hair. That
leaves only one solution:
afros.

Given ample time, every
player, regardless of race,
could pull off the White
Shadow hairdo. Now that
would be the complete player.

Matt Grove, a columnist for
The Pitt News, would look
truly unique in an afro.
