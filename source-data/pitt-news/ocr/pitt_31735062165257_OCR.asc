- Lee Benjamin, Col. ’55, 1954
Bandsman of the Year, has not
quite followed the old advice
“Go West, young man.” Soon
after his graduation in Janu-
,.;_\ _gry, he spent six months of

northern extremes of Canada, as
one of a select group of citizens
that joined a contingent of naval
personnel going to the Distant
Early Warning line, the North
‘ American continent’s northernmost
radar defense. ,
’ « In March, 1955, Lee, who works
at the Hydrographic Office in
'Washington, D. C., took advantage
of an opportunity to join the ﬁrst
group of the season going up to
the DEW line.

A University- wide vocational guidance program for.
women, the Cavalcade of Careers, will be held April 16 and
17 from 12:30 to 5 p.m. on the 12th ﬂoor. The Cavalcade of
Careers is sponsored by the Vocational Committee of WSGA.

The purpose of the progr

urged to attend several different
conferences.

The representatives are out-
standing persons in their chosen
ﬁelds and are well qualified to
offer assistance and guidance to
undergraduates. " 1

All women will be contacted '

Tuesday‘ through Friday by mem-
bers of the’ Vocational Committee

by telephone. At'that time, the

appointments will be made for the
interviews. ‘ .-
These 3 15 - minute interview
will be held in separate rooms
and will be private or‘, in a few
instances, in small groups. . ,
Some of the ﬁelds which will be
represented are social work,ﬂbusi-
ness, library (clerical and pro-
fessional), journalism, television,
stenographic, personnel, psychol-
ogy, interior decorating, fashion
arts, law, occupational therapy,
education for special children, and
college teaching. Nursing will not
be represented. 7 ,

All women are urged ‘to par-

ticipate in this program, not only
to make the Cavalcade of Careers

a success,‘ but‘ for their own) ad-
vantage, WSGA ofﬁcers stated.

have good reason for preferring a given area, and
Du Pont has an opening there for which you're

I _ When Richard Cunningham, assistant »to the Dean of
Men, admonished Inter-fraternity Council Members for

lack of unity, he brought to light a smoldering situation
that the Greek letter men, themselves, were not willingto

, Strong dissension exists in the Council due to the
conﬂict of representation among small and large fraterni-
ties. Yet, they cannot afford to let such pettiness squash
what should be ‘a united front on a campus-expanding to
take on a great inﬂux of out-of-town students.‘ '

The great advantages of fraternity life on a campus are
intimate and lasting friendships in a constantly vigorous

_ discuss ‘openly. -

- group; however,_ the new student dormitories can well pro-

vide a happier atmospherefor the transients, free of bick-
ering and minor nationalism. ‘ ' p »

Certainly, fraternity organizations recognized an _up
and coming indepedent vote when they began .to lure the
individualists, although for purposes of the election they
have manufactured -far more unity than is possible to realize
came out of a desire. to assure the general welfare for the
University student body.‘ ‘

The University situation is more optimistic for the-

greeks, for a fraternity row is in the planning as much as
the other changes. But it is useless to develop houses with
fine ‘exterior when the interior can little measure up to the
stability and unity that good architecture attempts to‘ show.

' Gunningham did the men a great service when he told
them where they’re wrong. They now realize more clearly
than ever that theirs ‘is going -to be an -uphill struggle.

 a worthy challenge.

  Cultural Weekend

‘ It will doubtless be a ﬁne experience having the Hailey-

bury troupe from England perform “Macbeth” as it was
originally produced in Shake_spear’s time. And it is a good

signto see a University department using its resources to-

soencourage such superior performers to come to this Uni-
versity. y We’re expanding in many ways, culturally as well
as-physically. ’ . '

.The weekend they perform will be a unique one, for,

Pitt Players will also present a more difficult presentation’

than usual with Shaw’s “Pygmalion.” Trained in the best
traditions of the Shakespearean acting, the English troupe
will prove considerably stiff competition for Players as far
as theatrical abilityis concerned.

Although such conflict in scheduling is undesirable, the
weekend combination should
experience fOI'/’ students.

By Ted Jamison

The view of the All-Pitt Par-

ty concerning the political par-
ties on campus are very similar
to those of the opposite political
parties.

We feel that
permanent po-
litical bodies
on campus will
stimulate the
interest of the
student bo dy
to such a high
degree that the
organizations of
student gov-
e r n m e n t
haven’t any al-

‘Young, Yet

It is evident that political par-

than a year old, have shown
themselves to be ‘an integral
part of student government.

should have. . -

No Pressure .

After the election there was
no pressure .exerted on the elect-

Pitt of a dynamic student gov-._

We know from the evidence
of the large volume of petitions

interest of the student body in

crease, and the credit for this
increase of interest can be at-
tributed to the political parties.

Fit to Govern

I, myself, have heard the
comment that only —people i of
“fraternity material” are fit to

govern at Pitt. Why? Is a man-

with a pin on his_chest better
than a man withouhfraternity
affiliation? _ .
One fraternity, the Phi Gams,
have joined the Independent
Party, not as a fraternity, but
as independent thinking
' This is what we are trying to
promote: the integrating of fra-
ternity and independent people

Can any one fraternity group

We, of the Panther Party, re-
cognize this fact and, although

technicalities have prevented
us from slatingras many inde-

pendents as wehad hoped to,

" over a hundred independents
have joined the party and we

also have thebacking of many .

independent candidates.

Sincere Endorsement

Even .though we "are backing
a number of independents, none
of them are being endorsed sim-
ply because they are not.affili-

- ated with fraternities. They are s

also outstanding student lead-
ers in their own right, as are our
other candidates. '

has used far more discretion in

Party Questioned

We noticed in the Pitt News
of April 4 a review of the plat-
form of each political party.
While we feel that these plat-
forms were probably dr-awn up
in good‘ faith we would like to
make mention of one item, in
the Panther Party platform.

Point number two indicated
a desire to reorganize student
ﬁnancing -— particularly of the
Pitt News. We feel that this
point only goes to show the
complete ignorance of the peo-
ple involved. The fact of the
matter is that no one from the
Panther Party has ever inquired
as to facts and ﬁgures, the rea-
«sons why the Pitt News schedule
has-.been_-cut-~' -   v  -

  

men;

the Editor 

Here are the facts: (1) The;-}’"' “

    

for the school and the students.-

The integration of indepen-
dents into the All-Pitt party is,
we assume, very much along the’
line of integration of them into‘
the other political parties.

It can be witnessed by the
political slates, of the various
parties and ours shows that there
are quite a number of indepen-
dents and fraternity men slated.
We are sure that the student rec-
ognizes that the best leaders are.
not found in one particular
group but found in a cross—selec_-
tion of individuals from their‘
member groups.

It is for this reason alone that
the All-Pitt Party has integrat-
ed Independents into its own
ranks. We want to give the stu-
dents a large representation of
good leaders in student govern-i .
ment. ‘V I \

only 20% of the entire under- ‘- I

graduate popu1ation?,‘Only you
as independent and as’ inde-
pendent thinking people can

answer that question with .your_ I

vote. ' ~
Permanency Needed _.
The Independent Party also
feels that, under the existing ’
voting system, permanent poli-
tical parties are needed. It
would be the party’s responsi-
bility to make certainvthat their
members who are elected be re--

‘sponsible leaders and not the?

Hoped-for Garage
To Oakland Area

In an-attempt to solve Pitt’s
parking problem, the P011
Committee of Student Con-
gress will conduct an all-in-
elusive poll Monday, April 23',

between" 7:30 a.m. and 9 p‘.m. A

The committee expects to
post representatives at every en-
trance to all University buildings.
Interfraternity Council has voted
to provide most of the,222 men
needed to carry out the program,
through ﬁaternity pledge pro-
grams.

Don Kaiserman, Col. ’58,
chairman. of the committee,
stated in a letter to pledge-
masters, “the result of this poll
may go a long /way toward the
building of a long-sought park-
ing garage for the Oakland
area.”

He also stressed that each in-
dividual polled must realize the

, importance of the poll before it

can become a complete success.

Supporting the idea are Dean of
Men Theodore Biddle; Captain
William Fisher, director of. the
Physical Plant; members of the
Board of Trustees; and the City
Traﬂic Commission.

Poll results will be tabulated

and evaluated by a corps,olE- stat-.

isticians.
Mixer Dances
To Begin Soon

The Social Committee of Stu-

gram of mixer dances on four
successive Wednesday afternoons.

i‘The dances begin .April 11 and
T continuevthrough May 2.

These mixers~ are open to’ all

"students. Each of the four classes

has taken the responsibility for

‘ anlindividual dance, although the

initial fee has been paid by Stu-

,'dent Congress. The Sepior Class

Officers, both men and women,
will sponsor the first dance at

.. Stephen Foster Memorial.

The Social Committee stated

.. _that this will give both men’ and

women a chance of working. to-

‘ gether even though'on_ a small

scale. It will also give an op-

-. portunity for mixer dances that

are not limited to frosh women

Scaife said that the long Westinghouse strike slowed
the delivery of “vital installations” for the new medical
building acrossfrom the Stadium. He added, “If this material '

can be delivered within the next¢

two months, the building should be
ready for occupancy by the School

-of Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry

and Pharmacy in September.”

Other building and conversion
projects at"Pitt,_are “continuing
on schedule,” according to the
report.

Food Services Moved

“Food services maintained for

, students are to be ‘moved to the

Schenley Park Hotel, which goes
out of business July l,” Scaife
stated. Certain “student activities”
will be moved into the hotel by
this September, he said.

Work on the conversion of
the Schenley Apartments will
begin by May, 1957, although
tenants have from twopto three
years to vacate.

The original site selected for
construction of domitories and
student union building on Rus-
kin and Tennyson Aves. and

“other campus

development,’f
Scaife added. ‘

He said that the 173-acre tract

near North Park which was pur- ‘

chased recently for use as a rec-
reation area will also be employed
for classes in natural sciences and
educational conferences. '
To Raise $500,000 -
The report also revealed that

Pitt is trying to raise ‘$500,000 to- ‘

pay off the two-million-dollar En-
gineering Building which opened
last September.

Scaife also stated that “there is
no reason to doubt” that thei'ﬁve-
million—dollar building for the
Graduate School of Public Health

won’t be opened by next Spring."

George Hubbard Clapp Hall
will be ﬁnished by June 1 and
opened for classes in the natural
sciences by next September, ac-
cording to the board president.

Scaife went on to say that the

Guard, Center Spots

Pose Big Problems

No pre-season analysis of football team would be com-
plete without a so-called “critical point.” For the 1956 Pan-
thers, the most serious problem appears to be the middle of

the line where the guards and centers hold sway.
Three of the top four guards and the ﬁrst two centers

have graduated from last season’s Sugar Bowl. To ﬁll the
gap, the gridders must rely on untried returnees and a

promising group of sophomores.

I The battle to replace‘ Harold
‘Hunter at the left guard post is
being waged‘ among senior Vince
Scorsone and two juniors-John

-DAN WISNIEWSKI
Most Prominent Contender

VINCE SCORSONE

edge because of experience and
size. A

However, 215-pound Guzik may

his steady improvement. Crafton
is handicapped by his 1_80—pound
weight.

At right guard, letterman Dan
Wisniewski is the leading can-
didate to replace Al Bolkovac.
Back from ,_,the wrestling wars,
he is the only returning right
guard who was even on the
traveling squad last year.

Assistant coach Steve Petro is
high on Wisniewski’s potential and
asserts that he has great possi-
bilities. But due to the wealth of
untried prospects at this position,
right guard could be the most wide-
open spot on the team.

Mid1and’s Henry Suﬁoletta, a
210—pound sophomore, is rated as
one of the best guard prospects in
several seasons.

Scherer Makes Bid

Also in the thick of the compe-
tition is Dick Scherer, a junior
from Pittsbur_gh’s North Catholic.
Scherer was a leading contender
for an end position last year, but
suffered a shoulder separation
which ‘handicapped him at that
spot. '

At center, the locals must come
up with replacements for John
Cenci and Ed Bose. This is the
only position on the team for
which there is no returning let-
terman. In fact, Chuck Brueckman
is the only returning Eenter.

Cummins Praises Brueckman

Thus the snapper-back . post
might seem to be a weak link in
the chain,. but the coaches regard

, Brueckman as a sleeper who may

prove to be one of the season’s
big surprises.

Last fall, he was acclaimed by
assistant coach Walt Cummins
to be the best defensivecenter
on the squad—'Cenci and Bose
included. The 205»-pound junior

may well turnout to be one of__,

the East’s top line—backers and,.
if he comes along offensiri/fely,r a
great all-around center.’ '

But -here, any optimism must be
squelched. The need for two more
centers is sorely felt. Unless some-
one is switched from another po-
sitign, the ﬁght will be among
juniors Jim Sabatini and Gene
Uhlman, and sophomores Ken
Montenari and Tom Salwocki,
none of whom have ever appeared
in a varsity game.

“Yes,” she said simply. Theyiembraced then and squeezed.

For avtimethings went swimmingly. Then a cloud appeared.

‘ Mary Ellen, it seems, was arich girl and accustomed to. costly.
pleasures. Poseidon was bone-poor and he quickly’ ran out of
money. Unable to take Mary Ellen to the posh places she fancied
and too'proud to _tell her the reason, he turned surly and full_ of
melancholy. Senseless, violent quarrels developed. Soon .it ap-
peared that the ronfance, so -promising at the beginning, was
headed for a breakup, but at the last moment, Poseidon man-

’ aged .to blurt out the truth. " f ‘ '
“Oh, beloved agrarian!” cried Mary Ellen, grappling him _

close. “Oh, proud husbandman! Oh, foolish reaper! Why have .

you notatold me before? I have plenty of money, and I will con-

tribute according to my ability."

Poseidon, of course, protested, but she ﬁnally persuaded him
of the wisdom of her course. From then on they split all ex-
penses according to their incomes. Rather than embarrass
Poseidon by handing him money in public, a. joint bank account '
was. set uppto allow him to write checks. Into this account each.
‘week they faithfully deposited their respective allowances — 35
cents from Poseidon; $2300 from Mary Ellen.- ’

And it Worked ﬁne! Gone was all the arguing and bickering.
They were happy — truly happy! And whatfs more, when they
graduated they had a nice little nest egg —- eight million dollars
— with which to furnish a lovely apartment in Lubbock, Texas,
where today they- operate the local laundromat. '

The regular season of the

Evening School student Ar-

The ivories are two giant tusks
of one of the largest-kno_wn_ele-

bassa, Africa, early this _year.
Along with Kenneth J. Doutt,
head of mammalogy at Carnegie

Museum, Wells plans to (Exhibit,
the African specimens in the mu-

That elephant, from which the
tusks were removed, measured
twelve feet shoulder height and
20.feet around the girth. The tusks
are two of the largest-known and
weigh 144 pounds.

Kenya Texas-Size

That area where he hunted, the
northern frontier of Kenya, is an
English colony and “is as big as
Texas,” said Wells.

The safari was six weeks
long. Although the tusks are on
