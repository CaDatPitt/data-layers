State Board In tervenes

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

A. strike by Pitt police,
scheduled for 12:01 this morning,
has been averted and University
and Campus Police representatives
are set to meet with a fact-ﬁnding
board perhaps as early as
Wednesday.

»“We were all set to go out

/today,” Pitt police union official

Ofﬁcer Robert Kolesky said. “A
lot of us didn’t want to, but if there
was no_other way we were set.

“It’s off for a couple of weeks at
least,” Kolesky added. “We have
verbal notiﬁcation that the fact-
ﬁnding board should be ready to go
by Wednesday.” _

The call for a fact-ﬁnding board

I came at Friday’s meeting between

police union ofﬁcals and University
representatives in which the
parties remained deadlocked on the
issues of wage increase, elimina-
tion of subcontracting for campus

Univ. Plans

  New Housing
For Couples

BY NORM MARTELLO .

In an effort to provide more
housing for- married students, the
University has acquired recently
three Oakland Avenue houses from

r’,’»"«"’-y the former General State Authority

I

(GSA).

Four of the ﬁve living units in the
three houses are occupied now by
Pitt students.

The University also is renovating
two apartments on South Bouquet
Street and examining the feasibility
of renovating two ' residential
houses on Atwood Street.

“These will be for . married
students and married , graduate
-students if it's economically feas-
ible," said Jay Roling, assistant to
the vice chancellor
Affairs. “The properties should at
least recover the cost of proper
maintenance."

The leases and rights are under
the University, but the titles to the

 property remain with the state.

Roling emphasized upkeep of the
properties as necessary for the
University to be a “good neigh-
bar.”

“It may get to the position where
we can start improving the

residential life style and tend to '

stop-gap-deterioration of neighbor-
hoods,” he said. .

“We're at an apex now where
Oakland can change into the
educational center it once was or
turn into a ghetto in some
sections."

The GSA, which merged last _

Monday into the Department of

..r_ General Services, bought the

,in the mid-’60s. The plan included

part-time hours on the force. .

“We’re still deadlocked,” Uni-
versity Employe Relations Director
Tom Cherry said. “We made no
change on money and the union
rejected an offer concerning
subcontracting. ’ - We offered to
update the clause insuring men on
the force their 40 hours a week, but
they said no.

“On the issue of part-time hours,

well, this is a wage and
subcontracting re-opener on a
three-year contract. Part-time

hours are not negotiable.”
‘ The dispute between University
and Campus Police ofﬁcers comes
at a scheduled re-opener in the
contract signed in 1973 permitting
unions to/renegotiated wage and
subcontracting clauses.

According to Kolesky, the move
to fact—ﬁnding that postponed the
Campus Police strike was resisted
by the University.

“John Quinn (the state-ap-
pointed mediator) invoked the
fact-ﬁnding board. ‘We wanted it,
but the University didn’t. We
wanted to try any legal means to
put off going on the street,”
Kolesky said. .

“We've asked them (the Univer-
sity) time and time again to go into
binding arbitration, but they’re
fanatical aboutnot doing it.”

The fact-ﬁndin g board, convened
by the Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tions Board (PLRB), will hear
arguments from both sides in the
dispute and serve a ruling within at
least 40 days. The ruling will’not
neccesarily be binding on the_
parties involved, according to
Cherry. I

“You can't refuse fact-ﬁnding,”
Cherry said. “In this case neither
side asked for it. The mediator
(Quinn) said he felt it was his
responsibility to convene a fact-
ﬁnding board.

“If we refused, we’d be open to
an unfair labor practice charge,”
Cherry added.

The University opposes ‘use of
binding arbitration, a method of
submitting pleas to a third

BY NORM MARTELLO

A proposal for a series of ﬁre
escape bridges connecting the 10th
floors of the Schenley Quad
dormitories was presented by
University ofﬁcials last week to
members of the Resident Student
Association (RSA).

RSA representatives were asked
to provide feedback from student

’ residents on the half-million-dollar
_ project. Completion of the two-part

program is hoped for by next

September, according to Housing‘

Director Don Hughes.

The plan would provide for
construction of three bridges
connecting Amos Hall and Holland
Hall North, McCormick Hall and
Holland Hall South, and Bracken-
ridge and Bruce ‘Halls.

Deferred Accounts Director Jo-
seph Gil, who also researches

‘ special projects for the vice
‘chancellor of business and ﬁnance,

recommended horizontal bridges
because they cost less. “They also

maintain existing security. rather A

than having an additional egress at
ground level,” Gil noted.

Fire escapes were ruled out by
law on buildings more than three
stories high. Additional stairwells
inside the building would eliminate
housing accomocations for_ 300
students and cost $3 million, Gil
said.

Hanging enclosed stairwells on
the dormitories was considered,
but “Schenley quadrangle has
what amounts to a hollow space
with the garage beneath the
buildings and structurally could not
take the load,“ Gil said."

The second part of the program
includes a system of emergency
two-way communications from

Teaching Quality Unpopularligf,

buildup of smoke in ﬁre exits, the
installment of sprinklers and smoke
detectors in " corridors, lobbies,
stairwells and storage rooms, and
the replacing of furniture, as
needed, with pieces of low

“We attempted to look at it as a
total package,” Director of Physi-

cited lack of concern, poor
communication, disorganization

and use of incompetent teaching-

assistants. This opinion was shared

stairwells, bridges and lobbies, Gil
explained.

The hazard of slippery stairs
drenched by sprinklers was raised
by Susan Fitch, an RSA represen-
tative.

Martin replied he would look into
the economic feasibility of non-skid
treads for stairs. “It will be a
considerable ﬁnancial burden with
as many as 1,200 treads that would
have to be purchased, and labor
cost would be considerable,”
Martin said.

RSA members were assured that

“pressurizing” stairwells to keep
smoke from entering would not
prevent doors opening to the neces-
sary escape routes.

“All the things we’re talking
about already exist on this campus
or elsewhere. But the bridges are a
ﬁrst as a means of ﬁre egress,”

Martin said.

Construction of the enclosed
bridges, sprinkler system and fans
to “pressurize" stairwells are
scheduled for next summer when
most of the quad dorms are
deserted.

work required from April to

' be solved internally Cherry said.

' “I could see binding arbitration
if some union wanted $2 and the

company was going to give 10

cents,” Cherry said, “but in this
case we aren’t that far apart.”

Negotiations between Campus
Police and the University broke
down over union demands for a
$.65 an hour increase, the abolition
of subcontracting security work on
campus and the strict limitation of
the hours put in by part-time
members of the force.

In earlier statements, Kolesky

works today.

“They still want to kick us out
and replace us with security
guards,” Kolesky said more
recently, “and to our mind security
guards just can’t do the job.”

The use of security guard
personnel as’ opposed to armed

~ Campus Police ofﬁcegs was viewed

by Police Chief Curt Grahafn as a
method of freeing ofﬁcers from
“locked-building” details to street
work, where their training was best
utilized.

One instane Graham cited was
the use of an ofﬁcer at Pennsyl-
vania Hall, which has had an
“insigniﬁcant” showing on Cam-
pus Police recordslas a crime site.

The contract between Campus
Police ofﬁcers and the University
will expire nearly 11 months from
now, on September 24, at which
time the entire contract, including
any additions signed as a result of
the current dispute, will be up for
renegotiation.

August,” Martin said. He added
that he hoped smoke detectors and
the communications network would
be completed by next February.
“Much of the materials are custom
made," Martin explained.

“Work would be principally in
the stairwells and would require
drilling. In addition, there would be
a run down each hallway. You
would be disturbed about a day on
each floor to install communica-
tions and smoke detection equip-
ment. The last intrusion would be
by a design engineer for brief
periods,” Martin told the RSA
representatives.

The RSA board was assured
notices of working hours of those
doing the installations would be
posted and a system of checking
workers in would be initiated at the
dorm lobby. a

“While the University was not
bound legally to make improve-
ments,” Gil commented, “we were
not satisﬁed with not having -to do
anything."

The project grew when concern
was expressed by a student
representative to the Board of
Trustees.

Teaching

(Continued from Page 1)

“Instructors have first-hand,
practical experience, not just an
academic background in my de-
partment,” a senior in the School
of Special Education said. “That’s
how they teach me what I need to
know."‘

“I’m impressed with the quality
of the Pitt faculty,” said James
Hart, ajunior urban studies major.
“In my department, we have
experts who are good in relating
what they know to the students.”

“Teachers here show a deeper
interest in the’ student and his
progress than in the three other

universities I’ve attended,” Julie .

feminist group and backed up
Saturday's nominations more than
eight hours.

The count on the second ballot
was 1,132 for DeCrow and 1,034 for
Myers. The total needed for

than half the total number of

GUNMEN KILL POLICE I

.BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP)—Guerrillas firing subma-
chine guns and throwing hand
grenades ambushed two police cars
near President Isabel Peron’s
suburban residence Sunday, killing

.....

five policemen and seriously
wounding one, authorities said.
They said one of the ofﬁcers was
“executed next to a tree,” but did
not elaborate. —

The president was not home at
the time of the ambush, but taking
a weekend rest at a resort 250 miles
south of Buenos Aires. It was not
immediately clear whether the
terrorists were plotting to assassi-
nate Mrs. Peron.

FRANCO STILL GRAVE

MADRID, Spain (AP)--Gen.
Francisco Francois doctors said
Sunday he has “total lucidity,’.’ but
that his condition still is grave
despite a respite from attacks on
his failing heart.

The latest medical bulletin
reported the 82-year-old head of
state slightly improved but held out
no hope for recovery.

A Madrid newspaper said openly
what the nation and its leaders
suspected and what ,Franco’s
doctors so far have refrained from
saying. “Franco is dying,”
reported the Nuevo Diario, adding
that the general also was suffering
kidney complications.

Knievel had just guided his

crowd-——originally predicted at
70,000—to about 35,000, and
Knievel said that cut into his

Knievel landed on the roof of the

A good-part of Oakland's ills lies with students who know they'll be
gone in a few years and with citizens who take little pride in their
community. Citizen’s groups have been trying to spruce up their end
of town for years, and Pitt students should realize by the very layout of
the campus that if Oakland sometimes resembles a dump, then so does
Pitt. There's little togbe said that hasn’t been said already. _

The ofﬁcial University has been derided in the past by Oakland
citizens for its physical expansion in the community. Students now
come under ﬁre for the same type of thoughtlessness, when really all _it_

takes is to hang on to that paper cup until you reach the trash can at the
comer.

America in pieces

BY TOM WASELESKI

I . ' The rash of criticism taken by the

news media in the wake of the two
recent attemptson the life.of the

' ‘President is wholly unjustiﬁed and
_seeks to make one sector of .

American society the scapegoat for
a serious social ill.

We can take Lynette Fromme off
the cover of the newsweeklies. We

. can take Sara Jane Moore off the

covers, as was done, and show
President Ford shaking hands in a

. crowd. We can take Lee Harvey

;";:;',>‘~,:'”v-_;-;L_l=-sV;:'

Oswald off the front page, run him
on page 22, and make believe he
wasn’t the biggest newsmaker of
the decade. But then we’ll be
reporting the news the way Pravda

. reports it.

And what's worse, we wouldn’t
have done anything to solve the
problem.

To peddle the idea that violence

 A is nurtured by television is to push

some pretty shabby goods. If
anything, television has proven
people are insensitive to violence.
Consider Vietnam. For 10 years‘
a mass audience watched its
soldiers kill and get killed every

B V night, and still viewers couldn’t tell

the real gore from the kind

A .. .manufactured in Hollywood.

‘Americans were as much affected
by Lt. William Calley as they were
by John Wayne shooting his way
for the umpteenth time over the
sands of Iwo Jima. _
The natural expectation when TV
began reporting the news realis '

Watch against their  - -

cally was that people would abhor

‘violence, become sick and horriﬁed

at the sight of it in their very living
rooms and thus bring .about a
universal wave of human under-

‘standing, unprecedented in the

annals of history. We were
supposed to have realized that their
problems were our problems, that

 Blaming It on the

our bullets did as much damage as 1

theirs, and so forth.

The reason this didn’t occur,
according to social psychologists, is
that society needed a defense
mechanism to shield itself from the
terrible, and nonetheless true,
news that was being reported every
day. '

Why we so readily chose to

. defend our psyches from the horror

before ever trying to correct it has

— never been adequately explained.

That an international peace
movement was in full swing, that
Americans were better educated
and more informed than ever, and
that the foremost voices in the
media were liberal make this
sudden rush to the defense
mechanism all the more unbeliev-
able. .

All the media do is report the
news. They don’t inject the events
and trends of the day as if they
were serum for forcing a society to
behave a certain way. There is
nothing in a newspaper that
doesn't allow its readers to put it
down whenever they want. There
is nothing hypnotic about the blue
TV screen that forces its viewers to

  ‘Fun City’ after the Cras

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

With New York City on the
brink of destruction, there will be
many changes in the way this
country views its. cities. The

spectacle of New York collapsing

must bring out the bestin what
foreigners of all ages. have
described as “Yankee Ingenuity.”
1) Strip mining: From the best
available estimates, New York has
almost $50 billion in raw materials
tied up in pipes, subway systems,
skyscrapers, government ‘ forms,
restaurants and cobblestone
streets. '
An effective program» of strip-
mining, converting these precious
materials into marketable litems
such as steel, graphite and landﬁll,
could well be a stopgap measure
for raising the capital to keep the
City aﬂoat. t
2) Sale: With millions-of dollars
in investments pouring into this
country from all over the world, it
shouldn’t be too hard to convince,
say, an Arab oil baron by buy large
tracts of Manhattan at a‘ sensible
price. I
Again this money could be
shunted into New York’s strained
economy, even now feeling the
crunch in a shortage of quadrupli-

M d’

One thing done to gloss over the
cracks turning up in our society as
they were reported in the media
was the deception in the govern-
ment’s ‘jargon. Thus the Cam-
bodian invasion became an ‘-‘incur-
sion,” a bombing became a
“strafing,” an entire war was
referred to as a “conflict,” and so‘
on.

The government’s leading role in
not owning up to its shortcomings
was aped eagerly by an entire
society that realized it was sitting
on top of the world, and therefore
could gain nothing but could lose it
all.

The character of a society that
looks out for itself, that seeks
adventure in place of the boredom
brought on by technology, that
stresses competitivness as a way to
perfection, that sees its way of life
as something as divinely inspired
as the right of kings to rule in the

Middle Ages, would naturally ﬁnd .

difﬁculty reconciling itself to the
evil reported in the news.

To blame society's faults, one of
which is violence, on the media’s
purported “gloriﬁcation” in their
covers, headlines and lead stories,
is to ignore the whole picture by
zeroing in on only a part of it. , The
media merely reflects this picture,
and at times, since selling is the
nature of America and even the
media, unfortunately, must sell

themselves, they give the people '

what they want to buy.

cate forms and paper clips.

3) The Old Switcheroo: Change
the name of New York City to
something like Pdunk, NY. The
resulting confusion in the banking
industries,-etc., probably will give
the City a year or two to. scrape up
the capital to ﬂee to the Bermudas.
Initially, there would be problems
with mailing, but then, with no
mail, there are "no bills.

4] Revolution: Declare an in-
dependent country under a military
junta and begin to torture political
prisoners. The resultant influx of
funds from the CIA should do the
trick.

5) Threats: The most interesting
of all possible schemes is to

threaten to move everyone into,
,New Jersey, or Boston; or to gun

every car in the New York area,
with the resulting cloud _of noxious
gases laying waste to the surround-
ing boroughs. This last plan would
take some coordination, but by a

"simple ﬂick of the switch the City

could lock every Streetlight on red,

and the rest will take care of itself.

At this point Mayor Beame also
could threaten to take matters into
his" own hands, to assert his
authority and to cast aside political
concerns for the salvation of the
City. Certainly this will light a ﬁre
under federal powers
dormant. '

6) Hostages: Although the entire
population of New ‘York City ‘is in

effect being held hostage, no one_

HOW‘

really cares that much about them.

The trick is to be selective and lay
hands on important people. The
entire United Nations is at New

York’s disposal, not to mention _

Norman Mailer and thousands of
mid-level literary and artistic
sychophants.

7) Suicide: The present curse
should sufﬁce.

8) Appeals: A house-to-house
appeal by members of the New
York City government to raise
funds to stretch the City past its
default date could be coordinated
with a nationwide telethon with big
names like Jerry Lewis and Erica
Jong.

With these few suggestions,
omitting themore popular, such as
cannibalism and feudal control by
appointed ward chairmen, New
York City could well see its way
into the 1980s at least. By that time
those hippies and ‘yippies ‘and
young people would be old...enough
‘to take responsibility, and_it’ll be
something to see how those
bleedinghearts handle this one.

But New York has always been
“Fun City”, for those with enough
money to avoid the people who live
there, and there is no reason why
we should abandon it now.

Let us hope Americans every-
where will ﬁnd the same patience

"in this crisis that they exhibited A

during the Vietnam matter.

‘Problem’ Kids
And the Paddle

Is the only solution to the
disruption and deﬁance by children
in the classroom the paddle? How
easy it would be if the problems of
both child and‘ teacher were so
easily solved. The trouble is not so
much those unruly, difficult chil-
dren as it is our inclination to use

them as scapegoats for our failures. "

We would rather hide behind a
paddle than to face the real
problem—the sordid, terrible in-
adequacies of the places and

conditions under which these"

“impossible” children are attempt-
ing to grow in. Deﬁance and
violence in our schools is more than
just a behavior prob1em——it is a
symptom—a reflection of our

ﬁlIlllllllllllllllllllllllllll

society’s decaying standards.

What right do we have to
demand respect from our children
when we offer them no sense of
well being or security—when the
very society they live in is doing its
level best to make children feel that
nobody cares about them? If we
cared, really cared about our youth ,
we would not tolerate the pollution
of our air and water, the
unemployment, the decay of our
government, the destruction of our
natural resources. How can we say
we care when funds for day
centers, medical research and
education are being cut.daily—-all’
of which is influencing and
affecting the lives of millions of our
children? Any society that loses
sight of its children as its greatest
national resource can have no
future.

If we want our children to show
respect and caring for their fellow
man, we must begin by showing
concern for them and stop treating
them as subhumans. Punishment
is more often than not an arbitrary

_ g_ excuse of power by the parent or

.M‘onday;October~27, 1975:—~THE-PITT-NEWS+‘Page:5. If

teacher. The adult becomes-
prosecutor, jury, judge and
warden. \The only lesson a child
may learn from his punishment
is-—power is what counts. If adults
would begin to think logically,
rather than punitively, and start
treating children with respect and
concern, they would find that the
majority of these so-called “prob-
lem” children would in turn
respond by respecting them.

The general feeling that we as

individuals can do nothing to’

change the conditions under which

-children are attempting to survive

is false. We can make a difference,

and we must! The paddle is not the
answer. The answer lies in adults
within the community who care
enough to interfere and show our
childrenthat the way they grow is

important to us all.

in  Job Panic?
Visit the Placement Service

December grads will never venture
inside its doors.

The University Counseling and
Placement Service is comprised of
four separate areas: Psychological
Service, Career Development Pro-
gram, Learning Skills Center and
the Placement Service.

All these services are open to
students throughout the year, but

-‘the Counseling Center services I

only 10% of the student body,
according to one employe.

The traditional aspect of place-
ment——.just ﬁnd the college senior a
job—is out of date vis-a-vis today’s

job market. Economic conditions ‘
L are putting increased pressure on,

employers and even more pressure
on those looking for jobs.

A new emphasis infiltrating the
Placement Service is toward
helping students decide on career
possibilities throughout college
instead of during the last-year
rush. In the complex of Counseling
and Placement there is a whole
menagerie of information.

Raymond Oyler, the associate
director of Placement, said the
Placement Service is helping
seniors pursuing employment

"through recruiters on campus and

applying for opportunities off-cam-
pus.

All year round the Placement
Service provides graduating sen-

iors with the opportunity to sign up
for interviews with recruiters from
various corporations, businesses

and social agencies. Recruiters

come .on campus and are given
rooms for conducting interviews.
Outside you always can see a

A major wofry was health care
for young people. Soon after the
Clinic was founded, word got
around and today young people,
mostly from the neighboring areas,

- constitute the majority of .patients.

“We get more young women,
mostly white, _than any other type
of patients. This is changing,
though,” Davidow explained.
“More and more black women are
coming to us lately, especially in
the family-planning clinic. I think
this is because right now this area
is a major concern for black
families.”. . V

Over 100 people are involved in
the Clinic’s, volunteer program.

ience, others to getto know more

professions.

dents nervously awaiting their
ch_ances at the $10,000-a-year job.
There are 24% fewer recruiters
coming to college campuses this
year, according to Oyler. “Because
of the economic conditions, stu-
dents are hard pressed to interview
with these recruiters,” he said.

One chemistry student anxiously-

awaiting an interview voiced some
criticism of the Placement Service.

“Both April and December grads
are signing up for interviews at the
same time,” she said. “That seems
unfair to December- grads since the
April grads will have another shot
at it.” _

She said a solution to this
problem .would be , to have
December and April grads sign up
on different days. Since a student
can sign up for only two companies
at one time, this might prove a
good idea.

Any student opting for an
interview with a company should
become familiar with the opera-
tions of the company before the
interview. Stacks of information on
businesses and corporations are
available in the Placement Library.

‘ ‘Each employer looks selectively
at the graduate according to
academic excellence and the ability

‘_to communicate an understanding
‘of the business or, skill to which he

is applying,” Oyler said.

One recruiter discussed the pros
and cons of the Placement Service.
“Not enough students come in or
even know about the Placement
Service. It would be helpful to the
students (seniors) if they ‘were
required to come in and register,”
he said. “There are a lot of helpful

.iCli'nic Won ’t Turn Penniless Away

The volunteer program for the
fall is already under way, but there
will be openings again in January
and February. The Free Clinic is
looking for people willing to
commit themselves for six months
to work one night per week and
attent regular monthly meetings.

“The volunteers can be, of any
age, but we ﬁnd that we get more
young people than anyone else,”
Davidow added. “Older volunteers
had interests in ﬁelds like biology
or chemistry but today that is also
changing. _

“The training program emphasis
is on health care in general. For
example, people interested in
counseling receive on-the-job
training," Davidow said.

The Free Clinic maintains a day
contraceptive care clinic ‘and an
evening walk-in - clinic. - At the

The recruiter said on the whole
the Placement Service is valuable
to the students but he said the
ﬁling system. is not as good as it
could be.

To help students with opportun-
ities off-campus, the Placement
Service holds seminars periodically
teaching students how to apply for
jobs. They cover resume-prepar-

ing, interviewing skills, assertive- .

ness training for the applicant,
employment trends and direct
applications.

The Placement {Service has

videotapes of actual interviews to

show students what and what not
to do. Permanent ‘career and
reference material is available to all
students.

For students dead set against
remaining in Pittsburgh for a job,
the Placement Service also has
contacts across the nation with
other university placement centers.
Oyler said if a student is willing to

‘‘If a student limits himself to
one certain area, he may miss
out on opportunities elsewhere,”
Oyler said. “Geographic prefer-
ence deﬁnitely narrows job oppor-
tunities.”

very simple procedure to gain
access to help from the Placement

ﬁlling out a registration form with

The immediate services available
at the Clinic are screening and

diagnostic aids. If further help is’

needed, affiliations with Children’s

Central Blood Bank among others

will take care of the major
problems.
Monetary expenses such as

Season opener

Shaliko Unites with Brecht

BY TOBI ROSEN

A dollar can still go a long way
these days. But in the theatre
world, 99 cents takes you even
further. I

Dick Mennen’s baby, the 99 Cent
Floating Theatre, has grown in its
‘second season into a strapping
few

Last weekend's production of

.Brecht’s The Measures Taken by

the ' Shaliko company, however,
sent the forthcoming season off and

i a running.

This is a political play in the
truest sense of the word. Politics is
more than campaign managers and
kissing babies—-it dictates the
manner human beings choose to
interact on personal levels. _

The Measures Taken explores

« the role of the “single man” in

relation to the political whole. Is it
better for one man (or woman) to
strike out against injustice, render-
ing it temporarily wounded, or
combat social atrocities on a larger
scale en masse, ignoring the
immediacy of an individual situa-
tion?

A young Russian comrade is sent
to China to teach the classics and
spread the word of the propagan-

’ » dists. During one assignment, he

distributes leaﬂets to the textile
workers who are breaking the
workers’ strike and returning to
their looms. A cop discovers one
worker reading the propaganda
and falsely accuses another worker

‘of distributing the forbidden paper.

The -young Russian, disguised as a
Chinese, succumbs to his sense of
pity. He violently cries out against
the accusation and kills the police

‘ ' ofﬁcer.

The consequences of his actions
By striking out, he

“greater
cause?” The police force sur-
rounding the factory was strength-
ened, the strike was broken, and
he could no longer distribute
leaﬂets amongthe workers.

After numerous similar disas-
ters, the four other Russians must

- kill their comrade to protect the
=Party’s secret work.

. bring their case before a panel that
must judge their innocence.

And they

We as audience members are
To
anyone who has ever attended a

lecture in David Lawrence Auditor-«

ium, the role was a familiar one.
The Chatham College Theatre’s
construction was strikingly similar,
aiding as‘ a vehicle to facilitate the
student role.

As students we were being
oppressed. After each act, as
clearly deﬁned by Brecht, one
woman on the panel asked the
audience to make moral judgments
on the group's actions. I haven't
felt so manipulated since Mrs.

Dunn’s 10th grade English class.
Sure we were asked questions.
Most were a little more profound
than “Was he right? Did he do any
good?” But remember, we were in
10th grade.

Surprisingly, the most interest-
ing questions came from the
audience as they interrogated the
actor.

One.woman raised an interesting
point by comparing the ideologies
of Tolstoy to those of Lenin. But
the furor and support this company '
‘generated was truly exciting.
There was no doubt this group
clung to a speciﬁc set of political
doctrines. These people could be
stamped as revolutionary Marxists.
But as someone from your own
peer group, possibly your own
neighborhood, offered vocal sup-
port, many of the'defense barriers
between audience and actors were
bridged.

When the audience is given the
freedom _to participate, it can
become difﬁcult to decipher who
has the power and control in a
situation. In a true learning
experience, there aren't any power
plays; both sides remain open to
the give-and-take nature of the

relationship. Shaliko remained
defensive and quick on the draw,
offering rationalizations for each
accounted (and unaccounted) for
incident.

As a groug of revolutionaries,
the members of Shaliko were

willing to strip themselves of their .

identities to better serve the Party.
And as actors, they formed a solid
collective united in their cause.

Their movements were swift and
sure, their commitment far more
than cerebral. It traveled
throughout their bodies until each
wasn't an individual, only a part 0
the whole. '

Their singing, however, was
done in harmony. It might have
been a better choice to drop the
harmony to emphasize anonymity
of the individual voices. They
would be united not only in spirit
but also in song.

Yet they never lost sight of the
fact that this was still theatre, in
the Brechtian sense of the word.
The piano accompanist twinkling
her ﬁngers over a grand piano

  Stills: Adequate Voice,

Hilarious Flo & Eddie

BY DOUG GEBHARD

“I got nothing to do but today”
-Stephen Stills from Stephen Stills
II. ,

F10 and Eddie are hilarious. I
laughed my balls off, that’s why
I’m writing this review...I have no
courage. I haven't the courage to
deflate another superstar image
that’s "been going down for a few

years...I have been partially’

responsible for this, too.

It all has to deal with fame. Mark
Volmer and Howard Kaplan have
received very little fame as F10 and
Eddie, but as the Turtles they were
on the charts as number one. They
have since been on their own,
grossing out D.Is throughout the
nation and humiliating their
audiences abundantly.

On Saturday night they had not
held back for one moment.
Rightfully rebuking an “asshole”
in the audience and tearing down
racist slurs we hide behind, these

two bastards of rock music
bombasted the maidenhead of
homecoming.

Stephen Stills, on the other
hand, has appeared to slip back
into a comfort of days gone by and
fortune gathered to deliver a weak
and somewhat disappointing per-
formance. It can be attributed to

his band, and it seems to me this I

always has .- been one of his
problems.

His opening number was one
many people should have expected,
and CSN & Y fans know it’s the
opening number to all the recent
concerts (of the past summers).
“Love the One You’re With”
attracts the crowd immediately. He
chose “Johnny’s Garden” as num-

ber two because of its lyrics and -

soft Stills’ playing.

“Wooden Ships” was excellent
and displayed his best electric
playing of the evening with the
following acoustic set offsetting

  Pgh. Ballet Dances Benefit

BY A. IRENE SCHMl])T
The ﬁrst impression of Pitts-

_burgh Ballet Theatre’s beneﬁt

performance at the Syria Mosque
Thursday night was uncomfortably
pathetic. '

Women hovered by each door
with beribboned baskets bearing
“Please ﬁll my basket” signs. The
audience ﬁlled little more than a
third of the Mosque. Administra-
tors of the company issued pleas
for generous donations. Because of
the symphony strike, a scratchy
tape accompanied the dancers.

But before the evening ended,
the Ballet Theatre had proven its
excellence against all odds. The
audience response was amazing,
showing the sort of enthusiasm

more often seen at a rock concert '

than a ballet.

The opening ballet, “Pas de
Dix,-” could well have been a
movement from the Nutcracker
ballet. The impression of red
velvet costumes coupled with the
superb performances of Jo Ann
McCarthy and Alexander Filipov
seemed almost magical, like
Christmas, like a fairy tale.

Although there was nothing
faulty in the dancing of the corps,
McCarthy’s tiny ﬁgure eclipsed
everyone on stage. Her own
enjoyment of the dance is
infectious. The corps dances for
the audience—she seems to dance
for herself, smiling at the music
and her own skill. Even Filipov,
whose leaps and pirouettes brought

ﬁrst movement alone. It seemed
that many who had come simply to
support the ballet in its hours of-
need became aware of a company
worth supporting on its own merit.
not simply because it’s the city’s
only chance for professional dance.

When the curtain went up for the
second ballet, “Symphony in C,”
theibare stage was steeped in a
dusky blue glow. Under that glow,
the russet costumes moved dream-
ily, as though the entire first
movement took place under water.

This ballet served as a spotlight
for the talents of Jordeen Ivanov
and Terry Dorado. The interaction
between the two in the Pas de deux
made them seem almost parts of a
whole. The same was true, to a
lesser extent of the couples in ‘the
corps de ballet.

Ivanov’s style forms an interest-
ing contrast to Jo Ann McCarthy’s.
Where McCarthy is light ‘and
quick, Ivanov produces the image
of a femme fatale, proud but
somehow dangerous.

That stylewas shown perfectly in

New Change of Pace  

Guitar Prince Gives

BY TOM WASELESKI

Chewing Pine, Leo Kottke.
Capitol, ST-11446

CHEWING Illll

orrxl

 

This is a great change of pace
album for "those who like rock’s

strength but tire of its bulging‘

muscled electriﬁcation.
Leo Kottke, a prince of the six-

and twelve-string guitars, has‘

assembled an assortment of instru-
mentals with three vocals to
bedazzle your acoustical ears.
Most of the tunes are written by
himself, though all of them are
given Kottke’s original touch.

 irst off, the best cut on the
album——I just have to get to it right
away—is Procol Harum’s “Power
Failure.” If you know anything
about Procol, this is one of their

favorite concert pieces, and they-

can really lay it on with a piano, an
organ and four har.d-driving
guitars. R

Kottke might rightly be expected
to fall ﬂat on his face with this one.
I mean, this guy doesn't even
overlay any tapes when he

records—take one good studio run -

through the song and _send it down
to the presses, that's it. Instead,

,3.»-,5;he comes through with the best
"~c—3i"twelve-stringer I’ve heard since

M tion,

Mason Williams’. “Classical Gas.”

With every verse, there’s more
sound, more intricacy adding to his
voice, which by the way, does the
song more justice than Gary

-Brooker’s rocky bark on Procol’s
original. After some fancy soloing
in the middle, Kottke comes back
with a rollicking verse, this time

backup. Whether or not you like
the other cuts, this song makes the
album worth it.

“Venezuela, There You Go” (a
title almost as enchanting as
Jackson Browne’s “Jamaica, Say
You Will”) is an easy instrumental,
a little more electriﬁed this time,
though you hardly notice it.

A really light dance tune is
“Regards from Chuck Pink,”
though it's hard to say exactly what
you’d dance to it; the old soft shoe
might be close. ‘

“Monkey Money” would make
good background music for one of
those hillbilly chase scenes; “Grim
to the Brim” and “Rebecca” are
pure classical guitar, “Trombone”
is positively Spanish romantic.

humorous “Can’t Quite Put It Into

But we never forgot that this was
theatre. Instead of placards

There was a dual feeling of
reality. They were more than just

actors doing a “convincing” job of'
highlighting reality. They molded»

their own beliefs by choosing a
suitable piece of expression while
carefully combining the pace,

heighten a “higher cause.”

Here again
Filipov garnered bursts of applause

‘ for his one-armed ‘supports of his

The last segment. of _the
production included a series of
ethnic ballets, one Italian, one
Tirolean, one Spanish, and ﬁnally
the Gopak, a Ukranian folk dance,
featuring the entire company.

Most noteworthy of this ﬁnal
segment was the comedy relief.
The dancers pantomimed a ﬂirta-
tious love _triangle in the Italian
dance, and parodied bullﬁght
gestures in the Spanish number.
The costuming was ‘brilliant,

involving the audience in every
motion.

The ethnic theme climaxed in the
ﬁnal segment, the Gopak. In the
center of a laughing, clapping, ring
of dancers, several men from the
corps de ballet performed a spirited
series of intricate Russian (Cossak)
dances. At times, ballet came
perilously close to gymnastics. If
anything, that was an asset.
Within minutes the audience was
stomping and clapping to the music
which steadily increased in tempo.

If ballet companies would do
encores, the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre would have been forced to
stay for another hour.

Cubs Crush Tems 21-6,
  Close Out Season

-. BY JAN MATTHEWS

The turnaround may be com-
plete.

After the humiliating loss to‘
Potomac State two games ago, the
Pitt junior varsity football team
raised its record to 2-1-1 Friday

’ afternoon with a 21-6 trashing of

the Maryland JVs.
While the offense sputtered, the

defense ran like a smoothly tuned

engine.

Maryland could manage only 179
yards total offense against the
Cubs, but 123 of them came in the
ﬁnal ﬁve minutes of play after Pitt
had mounted a 21-0 advantage.

-Defensively, the Cubs were
equally stingy over land and

through the air.

‘,The Terps managed "only two-
and-a-half yards a pop on the
ground, and their big run of 15
yards was by fullback-turned-quar-
terback David O’Dell. Starting QB

Chris Ward fell victim to a Cub—
- blitz in the ﬁrst quarter.

O’Dell was ineffective as a
passer, completing nine of 29 with

three interceptions.

Defense led to the ﬁrst Cub
touchdown. After a recovered
fumble, Thomsindewald went over
from the one and the half ended,
7-0.

Neither team could move the ball
in the second half until Pitt QB
Chris Legree lofted a 58-yard
scoring bomb to Ron Medley,
making the margin 14-zip.

The defense, fittingly, was
responsible for the ﬁnal score. Don
Spiranae intercepted an O’Dell
aerial at the Terp 14 and Greg
McCray capped .the short drive
with a six-yard power drive late in
the game. .

Coach --Larry Holton was not
completely satisfied with his
team’s play.

“Although I was happy with the
over-all play, Iwouldn’t say there’s
no . room for improvement,” he
said. “We still have to work on our
timing and execution.”

With the Cubs improving every
game, it’s not likely they will have
to make another about-face.

The Pitt cross-country team won
the United Nations Invitational on
Saturday at Kent, Ohio. Pitt’s 37
points was sufficient to beat home-
team Kent State with 41, Edin-
boro with 42 and Slippery Rock
with 119.

Senior Nick Martin lead the Pan-
thers to victory over the fast
six-mile course in the near-record
time of 29:26. Kent’s all-American

- Mark Hunter was second, fol-

lowed by Pitt’s Mel Boyd.

Coach Mike Agostinella was
pleased with the team's perfor-
mance.

. “Ev-eryone did a super job,” he

said. “Although Dave McDonald’s
big, move in the finishing

a stretch was a turning point in the

race, it would be hard to pick just
one member who was exceptional
‘when each of the guys ran their
best races to date.

"Our training program builds on
100 per cent effort, not just to win.
If the runners all give 100 per cent,

they will _win almost all or
the time.

“Soon winning becomes a habit

and you are not afraid of any team.
Kent State was second in the Cen-
tral Collegiates last year and they
have not lost anyone and Edinboro
is ranked second in the nation for
small colleges, but we handled
them both.”
The Panthers, 5-0, now move to
the Central Collegiate Champion-
ship meet next Saturday at Penn
State.

BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

You might call it the Domino
Effect. When you line up a group
of dominoes and then push one
over, the rest tumble.

So it was for the Pitt Panthers
Saturday afternoon, Homecoming,
when the Navy Midshipmen shut
out a Pitt home team for the ﬁrst
time since 1968, 17-0.:

“It wasn’t really one certain
player who made a mistake, it was
more like everyone made errors,”
said Head Football Coach Johnny
Majors. “Once things start going -
bad, it’s hard to right them,
especially against an emotional
team like Navy.” »

Navy did live up to its advance
billing as the number-two defen-
sive team in the nation, as it met
the Panthers, a team with one of
the highest total offensive yardage
machines in the country. The Mids
limited Pitt to a total of 223 yards,
45 less than Tony.Dorsett’s total

=|||IlIlllllllllllllIIIllHllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE
WillllllllIII!lllllllllllllllllllllllilllllIIIIIIIIIE

yardage against Army the week

before. ' .

Bright spots? All in all there
were two for the day. As expected,
Dorsett got his 100-yard perfor-
mance, 18 for’122 yards, but could
get only as close as the one-foot

Kick Grove City, 2-0

line.

The other spot of light was the
ballet-like performance of fresh-
man split end Gordon Jones.
Called on to run back punts—and
he ran back a few on the
day—Jones couldn’t be brought
down; he showed balance and
moves the envy of any basketball
player.

' “We made more mistakes today
than we did in any two games up

_ until this time,” Majors said. “It

was frustrating.”

Mistakes. . Like in the ﬁrst
quarter, following one of Jones’
punt returns. Dorsett went into the
line with a ﬁrst and 10 at the Navy
16, but didn’t come out with the
ball. The Mids’ all-American
candidate rover, Chet Moeller, had
scooped up the pigskin.

Or the offside penalty three plays
later that kept alive a Mid drive
that led to the ﬁrst score of the day.

Or how about the 75-yard Dorsett
touchdown, a_beautiful weave from
the outside to the inside, only to be
called back because of a ﬁve-yard
penalty for illegal motion on the
ﬁne?

And that was only the, first"
quarter. Things didn’t get much
better for the more than 41,000
people in the stands.

In the second stanza, Navy found
itself with a fourth and nine on the
Pitt 36. Steve Dykes kicked the ball’
into the end zone on a ﬂy—no

problem, Pitt’s ball on the 20. But‘

no, folks, a ﬂag dropped and Pitt
was given a 15-yarder for illegal
blocking. Navy had an automatic
ﬁrst down. .

“That was the ﬁrst time this year
we’ve been called for that move,”
Majors said.

 

Luckily for the Panthers, a‘f‘§~-

43-yard ﬁeld goal minutes later was
short, but it didn’t help matters
much. The Panthers went into the
locker room at the half trailing by
seven.

The second half didn’t help

ONY 

Panther morale either. Receiving

the kickoff, the Mids took less than9€,_

ﬁve and one-half minutes and just
11 plays before tailback Gerry

Goodwin, who picked up 109 yards

on the day, went in from the two.
Navy 14, Pitt _0.

Jutca ‘Heads’ Booters To Win

BY JIM LEWIS

May it never be said the Pitt
soccer team doesn’t use its head.
Pitt high scorer Al Jutca scored
his seventh and eighth goals of the
season en route to the Panthers’
2-0 victory over outclassed Grove
City. _ -
Jutca’s two goals in the second
half broke a 0-0 halftime tie and
enabled the Panthers to increase
their record to 5-4-2.
Pitt didn’t seem to be concentrat-
ing in the ﬁrst half. The Panthers

passed the ball well out of their

own territory, but threw it away
most of the time inside the Grove
City 20-yard line.

“We didn’t play too well in the
ﬁrst half,” Coach Leo Bemis
agreed. “We couldn’t control the
ball in the ﬁrst half.

“We made too many turnovers, ’ ’
Bemis continued. “The first half
was ragged.”

There were a couple of reasons
why Pitt couldn’t go ahead. First,
the Panthers had the s_un and the
wind hitting them in the face.
Second, Grove City protected its
goal with nine of 11 players’ on the
ﬁeld. Everyone and his uncle was
playing defense when Pitt came
close to the goal.

But Pitt came out thinking in the
second half.

The Panthers then dominated
"Grove City, allowing only two shots
on goal in the second half.

“We lacked ball control in the
ﬁrst half,” Bemis explained. “The
insertion of Mark Nigh into our
lineup in the second half helped our
ball control. He’s a good
ball-control player.” »

Pitt broke the tie in the secon
half on a terrific second-effort goal
by Jutca. After his first head shot
on the Wolverines’ goal failed, he
fought to get another head shot.
He didn’t miss the second
opportunity, and put Pitt out in,
front, 1-0.

A few minutes later, the
Panthers went ahead‘, 2-0. Right
wing John Curley rushed down the
sidelines with the ball and lifted a
high shot to the left of the Grove
City goal. Jutca was waiting at the

past a disgusted Wolverine goalie
for the ﬁnal score.

“We got good scoring opportuni-
ties and made the most of them,”
Bemis said on the game plan. “I
felt we had the game under control
at the end.”

Pitt did have control of the game
at the end; after a very close ﬁrst
half, the Panthers never seemed to
relinquish the ball and ended up
outshooting Grove City by a 2-to-1
margin. |

Even though Jutca scored both
goals, he wasn’t the only hero on
the team. John Morahan, Ernie
Gross and Curley (along with
Jutca, the four seniors to whom the
game was dedicated) played well.

Andy Behrend, the Pitt lineback-
er, was especially instrumental,
making a great save on a sure goal
shot by Grove City when Pitt goalie
Frank Bucci was caught out of
position.

 

  
   

~ ,

The defense, made up oi“\v‘.-31;’

Behrend, Chris_ Connolly, Kim
Blasko, Mark Gannon and Bucci,
played well, shutting out the
offense that helped Grove City to a
6-2-1 record.-

“The entire defense did a good
job,” Bemis boasted. “I can’t say

-enough about their performance.

They deserved the shutout.”

The shutout was the fourth in 12
games for Pitt, which travels to
Lock Haven for a make-up game on
Wednesday. But the Panthers
won’t go down there with swelled
heads.

“That game will be a big one,”
Bemis warned.
will assure us of at least a .500
season.” .

The Panthers now are using their
heads——and that could mean
they’re headed for a winning
season. V

2-0 victory over Grove City this past weekend. Jutca is the leading

left side and again headed the ball _ scorer on the team with eight goals.

While most of us have a good

picture the agonies and ecstasies
these few blessed human beings
experience in their crawl to the top
of the listings.

The Yogi Feature is a tradition at
the Pitt News, taking up space on

strange, illiterate carvings on the
ancient "pyramids as the source for
this semi-religious fanaticism,
others turn over and go back to
sleep.

Since its inception, the grand
designation of “Yogi” has been
placed on the shoulders of many
Americans, some ofwhom are now
dead, others in the fields of
accounting, second-story robbery
and mufﬂei: repair., and still more
of whom are now dead.

Of the living Yogis quite a few of
these are dead too, or at least
awaiting a Supreme Court ruling,
but we can pass over their trials
and tribulations to approach a
much bigger problem: How do
Yogis feel about their profession?

“You don’t get much sleep,” the

“teams remarkably close in all areas
of play. The only problem was, the
Panthers couldn't get into the end
zone. They did come close in the
fourth quarter, only to have a
one-foot sneak by quarterback
Robert Haygood stopped cold.

“Navy did a trememdous _iob,”
Majors said. “We gave them a lot
but they earned just as much. - It
seemed at first as if they were
running down the defense’s throat.
But when they tightened, the
offense couldn’t move the ball. .

“The clock didn’t run long
enough today," Majors continued.
Sometimes it ran too fast, other
times it ran too slow.”

IRA ASKS RELEASE

MONASTEREVIN, Ireland
(AP)—Rory O’Brady, head of the
political wing of the Irish Republi-
can Army (provisional branch)
appealed Sunday for the release of
kidnaped Dutch industrialist Tiede
Herrema from a bedroom
“prison.”

“I appeal to the kidnapers to
release him, to release him now
and to release him unharmed,” O
O’Brady said in his presidential
address at the annual conference of
Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing.

The move was reported in Irish
radio bulletins in the hope that the
kidnapers, Eddie Gallagher, 28,
and’ Marian Coyle, 19, might be
listening, although it was not

certain they have ‘a radio with them

in the besieged house.

 

The Grand Wazoo, now in a
desperate, tooth-claw and zipgun
battle for the top spot with Hockey
Sybert and Smokin’ Stouffer (both
of the sports staff) could only
mutter, “It’s great to beat the
sports writers at their own game.”
V Smokin’ Stouffer, another con-
tender for numero uno, took time
out from ﬁling his teeth to
needle-sharp points to comment
the game was the be-all and end-all
of Western civilization.

“As sports editor it’s my
responsibility to go all-out in any
sports-related project.”

“My advice to aspiring Yogis out
there is simple: Drink beer.”

Dulbano In For Pens,

Boxing Match Begins

BY STEVE SYBERT

When Steve Durbano was put
at right wing early in the third
‘period of the Penguins-Flyers
game Saturday night you knew
something was about to happen.

.The Flyer right wing is a fellow
named Dave Schultz, the baddest
man to hit the ice since the
Abominable Snowman. With the
Penguins trailing 4-1 and not
mustering much of an attack, the
shifting of defenseman Durbano to
a forward position opposite Schultz
could mean only trouble._

Perhaps it was in Penguin Coach
Marc Boileau’s game plan.
Starting a ﬁght or an all-out brawl
is a-traditional method of getting a
hockey team’s adrenalin ﬂowing
again. What was once a hockey
game became a match of two
heavyweights in the Saturday night
ﬁghts at the Civic Arena boxing
rings, placed conveniently in one
corner of the rink and in the penalty

box. ._ - _
Philadelphia controlled the face- ’

off and knocked the puck into a
corner of the Pittsburgh zone.
Schultz went in after it with.

Durbano, a gleam in his eye visible
even from Section C, right behind.
Durbano came out much later with
ﬁve penalties worth 29 minutes and
an early shower.

Penalty number one—Durbano
cross-checks Schultz, living up to
the hockey fundamental of playing
the man and not the puck, with
“playing the man” used very
loosely. ‘

Penalty number two—Durbano
drops his stick and gloves andtakes
a swipe with his ﬁst at Schultz’s
head and earns himself two more
minutes for roughing. E

Penalty number three—Durbano
wins the ensuing fight and earns a
ﬁghting-major for his award.
Schultz is given the same for
finishing second.

Penalty number four--Both
ﬁghters want to go on to round two
and so by not reporting to the
penalty box, draw ‘ten-"minute
misconducts.

Penalty number ﬁve—While in
the box, Schultz still provokes
Durbano who throws a full water
bottle at his opponent’s head and
misses by inches.
