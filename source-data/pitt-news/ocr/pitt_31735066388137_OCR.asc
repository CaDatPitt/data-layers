police report: “The victim stated
that she was sleeping in bed when
awakened by someone in her
room. The actor was standing
over her with a pillow in his

kill you.’ She screamed several
times. He put the pillow over her
face. That is when he attacked

The city report lists the actor as

wearing a brown V-neck, waist
length jacket”

The incident, which occurred

Brennan said the report was
not released to him until
yesterday, a few hours after 779e

a city police detective.

The incident is being
investigated by city police. At the
present time, there are no
suspects.

SGB asks students

to purchase tickets
to basketball games

By Michael]. Lowe
Staff‘ Writer

The Student Government Board
has asked Pitt students to support
a proposal to charge money for
basketball tickets.

Dr. William Harmon, vice
president of Student Affairs, said,
“The university is experiencing a
ﬁnancial crunch right now, and
the students would directly benefit
from such a program.”

The SGB and the freshman
council are conducting a poll to
see if students would be willing
to pay $2 to $3 for the tickets.

Dean Billick, assistant athletic
director, said, “The decision to
pay for basketball tickets is a
decision that has to be made by

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Sta_,0' wruer

the students themselves.”

The athletic department said it
receives no money from the sale
of student football tickets and
would not receive any money
from basketball tickets. Billick
said he is concerned that students
will think that the athletic
department would receive the
revenue from the tickets. In fact,
money from basketball«ticket
sales would go into the student»
activities fund.

The SGB said the following
could be funded with the revenue:
late~night study areas and
residence-hall improvements,
including new televisions and
furniture, possible installation of
cable and videocassette recorders
and increased visitation privileges.

S!a_[)" Writer

Pitt has occasionally been
recognized as a national
powerhouse in many major
sports: football, basketball, men’s
and women’s swimming, pool.
That's right — pool!

At the regional qualifying
tournament at West Virginia
during the weekend of Feb. 8 to
10, Panther Pocket Billiards Club
member Anurag Mehta won the
men’s division, and Kim Kolesar
took second in the women’s
division. Both qualiﬁed for this
year's national tournament, which
will be held at Pitt from April 19
to 21.

Pitt has sent someone to the
ﬁnals for the last eight years. This
is the ﬁrst time that a school is
sending two students to the ﬁnals.

Mehta, known as Ani, is a
graduate student in his ﬁnal year
of mechanical engineering. Mehta
started Pitt at age 15. He is now
21 and in his ﬁfth and ﬁnal year
of eligibility.

“I started shooting pool in
January 1986, when I was a
second-semester freshman. I was
commuting. The atmosphere and
watching people shoot intrigued
me, so one day I picked up a

stick. The people were really
friendly. Chuck Farinella, who is
a four-time regional winner, and
J.R. Calvert, who were also both
mechanical engineers, taught me
to play pool by using physics.”

Mehta said, “IR. taught me the
game with free lessons that
normally would have cost at least
$20 an hour. I was fortunate to
learn from professionals and their
experience.”

Mehta’s first regional-
tournament experience came in
February 1988. “J.R., Chuck, Paul
Fine and I went to WVU. I didn’t
think I had a chance, but I came
in second afterl lost toJ.R. in the
finals. It was sheer luck!”

Mehta credits many things for
his success in pool. But most of
all, he said, "I need support. My
friends helped me win, and I did
it for them.

“Pool is extremely addictive.
For a while I stopped attending
classes, except for exams, and I
played from 10 [a.m.I to 10 Ip.m.].
But the time I spent down here I
would not trade for a 4.0 average.
I've met some incredible people
whose friendships will last a
lifetime. They are not just fellow
players. They are complete
friends," Mehta said.

“The billiards room has 14 4-

feet—by—8—feet tables and three
billiards tables. National
tournament regulation tables are
4 and 1/2 feet by 9 feet and are
being rented for the tournament.
There is room for more tables,
and we have often thought about
removing the great mystery wall
of the pool room. Storage is the
only thing back there, and we
really wish we could knock it out
and expand," he added.

According to Mehta, the
tournament involves the
traditional game of 8—ball, which
he enjoys. But he prefers 9—ball
for recreation.

“At the WVU tournament [Pitt
was] favored even before we
arrived. J.R. immediately placed
a 50-dollar bet on me as a form of
intimidation. Though I had little
to no sleep during the weekend,
I lost only one game during the
matches of the first two days."

There were 48 men there who
played in eightgroups ofsix. The
top two of each group advanced,
bringing the total down to 16.

Mehta said, “Eight of them
could do well at nationals, so this
explains how tough the

competition was. The ﬁnal key
to winning WVU was the music
playing. I started singing while
shooting, and it kept my mind in

the right frame and helped me
avoid nerves.

“When I got to the ﬁnals, I
realized that I had spent too much
money and time not to have the
plaque for winning. God was
completely behind me. I was
winning when a block of Eric
Clapton came on. He is a favorite
of mine, as I play guitar and lead
vocal in the band Pathos. When
Clapton came on I knewl would
win. I beat IMountaineer team
member] Kobayashi to ‘Badge’!”

Kim Kolesar, 20, is a junior
majoring in business and statistics.
She is also the ﬁrst Pitt woman to
qualify for nationals.

“We had a lot of fun at WVU,
and it was one of the best
weekends of my life, " said Kolesar.

The women’s competition was
a round-robin tournament with
the 12 participants split into two
brackets, each playing five
matches. The top two in each
bracket then played in the
semiﬁnals, where winning two
out of three qualiﬁed for the ﬁnals.

“Women are getting more into
pool all the time, and the
competition is becoming better
and better,” said Kolesar.

“I can’t wait until nationals. If I
put in a lot of practice, I think I

Moore becomes new
head of neuroscience

By Amy Kapusta
For The Pitt News

When Robert Moore was a
freshman at the University of
Chicago he planned on becoming
a literary critic. Today, Moore is
the newly appointed director of
Pitt’s Center for Neuroscience.

The road from being an English
major to becoming a doctor has
taken Moore across the country.

Though Moore was on an
English scholarship at the
University of Chicago he soon
decided he “didn’t like it and
wasn’t good at it.”

He then turned towards
studying the nervous system and
earned his masters and doctorate
degrees, respectively.

Moore soon became a professor
and worked at various colleges,
teaching since 1964. Within this
time, he taught at the University
of Chicago, the University of
California and at the State
University of New York at Stony
Brook.

Though Moore has changed
jobs many times in his career, he
said he plans to stay at Pitt until
he retires. Moore said he likes it
here at Pitt and feels it has “very
good faculty and students.”

Today, as director of Pitt’s

Neuroscience Center, he plans
on continuing some of his studies.
One of his most prominent studies
concerns circadian rhythms. This
examines the parts of the brain
that tell us to sleep at night and
be awake in the daytime, among
other things.

Moore is also a consultant at
the Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical
Research Center at the University
of Pittsburgh. He gives advice to
people who research Alzheimer’s
Disease. Moore has been a
consultant since 1984.

“Alzheimer’s Disease is a very
active area, and there are many
advances in treatment but no
cure can be made within the next
ten years,” he said.

Pitt’s Center for Neuroscience,
which was established in 1984,
encouraged the study of
neurology, pharmacology,
biochemistry and many other
fields. Started by the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, the schools of
medicine and pharmacy and the
Graduate School of Public Health,
the department has expanded
and improved greatly over the
years, according to Moore.

Moore said Pitt’s neuroscience
community is very strong
compared to that of other colleges.

College Republicans elect new officers

By Lynne Mosier
Sla_ﬂ' Writer

The College Republicans said
on Monday at its annual officer
elections that it is looking forward
to debating the recently
reorganized Young Democrats.

“We’re glad the Democrats are
back so we can have debates,”
said senior Toddjordan, outgoing
president of College Republicans.
“A two—party system is what this
country is based on, so it's good
to have it here at Pitt.”

Jacinta Dvorak was elected as
the new president. Her goals for
the organization include

mobilizing with Republicans from
Carnegie Mellon and Chatham
College and getting more in-
volved with Allegheny County
elections.

According to Dvorak, a junior
liberal-arts major, the College
Republicans were instrumental
in getting Rick Santorum and
Melissa Hart elected to offices in
November.

Rick Santorum is a junior
member of Congress, and Melissa
Hart is the first female state senator
in Pennsylvania history.

‘‘We’ve heard that we’re
infamous from [New Jersey state
Rep.l Chris Smith,” said Dvorak.

“The future is the youth, and I
truly believe that. Since the
situation in the gulf, I think more
and more people will be coming
to our side.”

The College Republicans have
50 to 75 members, according to
group member Rob Lewis. “We’re
a growing organization; we get
more people all the time," he
said.

The College Republicans’
priority until May will be the
county elections. According to
Tina Negi, a member of College
Republicans, Republicans have
not had control of the
commissioner’s seat for over 50

years.

There are three seats in the
commissioner’s office: two
elected positions and one

appointed.
Currently, a Republican
occupies one seat. Six

Republicans are running for the
two seats in the May primary, and
according to Jordan, this could
have a major effect on the the
balance of power in the county.
Other officers elected at the
meeting were Kevin Docherty,

secretary; Steve Barbery, business
manager; and Jonathon Kurland,

Boston journalist: Homeless need more than place to live

“Homelessness is a series of
losses,” she said. Most of the
homeless, especially women,
“have no coping mechanisms.
They become involved in

relationships,” according to
Hirsch.

This cycle leads to self-violence
and denial, she said.

Mehta said that Pitt is a superior

According to Mehta, “Pool

As a result of her experiences,

frame of understanding about
the homeless problem. Coming
from dysfunctional families, they
both retreated to the streets to
escape the violence they were
experiencingwithin theirhomes.

Hirsch said that in order to
combat the problem of
homelessness, “we need to
provide more than four walls
and a bed.’ She said that most of
the people living on the streets
don’t want to return immediately
to an apartment or “safe” living

environment because there is a
“profound sense of isolation.”

Hirsch said a culturally
determined value system, as well
as the lack of options in our
violent society, adds to the
homeless situation.

Hirsch, who has researched
and written about a number of
feminist issues as well as about
family, the workplace and child
care, will be speaking in different
areas in an attempt to create
solutions to homelessness.

Charging notfoul...

Although Pitt lost its second—round game to Kansas last
Saturday, the Student Government Board is still thinking
about basketball. The board, however, is thinking in
terms of next season.

The SGB is currently conducting a survey to see if
students on this campus would be willing to pay for
basketball tickets in exchange for certain luxuries. All
money, approximately $2 to $3 per ticket, would go
directly into the student—activities fund.

This plan calls for the money to pay for a shuttle to all
home games, including those at the Civic Arena. The
board also plans to improve the dormitories with the
money, possibly refurbishing and remodeling the lounges
and adding cable television.

Since the athletic department will not gain any money
from this charge, students will be able to profit from it.
Students will be able to see the tangible benefits of the
charge instead of wondering how the revenue is spent.

But for this plan to work, it needs to benefit all students.
Therefore, renovations of the dormitories should be
reconsidered; this is an incorrect target for the funds.
Although students in the dorms would reap the benefits
of new televisions and other luxuries, this would not aid
therest of the student population.

The proposed shuttle to the games, however, will serve
all students equally. With various stops in Oakland or
even at one stop such as the William Pitt Union, students
will be relieved of the task of hiking Darragh Street to get
to Fitzgerald Field House.

Nor will they have to worry about getting to the Civic
Arena.

Unfortunately, many students cannot go to Civic Arena
games, merely because there are not enough tickets to go
around. More Pitt students want to see and support their
team during marquee games, such as those against
Georgetown and Syracuse.

With the additional charge for tickets must come the
additional seating for students. Pitt must allow more
space than the allotted 2,000 student seats for these
games. This will benefit both the students, who are
ultimately paying for the service, and the university by
showing other teams that the student body is supportive.

All of the Big East basketball teams currently charge
their students for tickets. It is time for the University of
Pittsburgh to gain some benefits from student-ticket
revenues.

Last year, the Student Government Board was heavily
criticized for being out of touch with the students. This
initiative by this year’s SGB takes yet another step toward
ridding itself of that reputation.

Vague ideas from a vague mind

Not that it matters, but:

-Los Angeles Police
Commisioner Daryl Gates was
the focus of a 20-minute
demonstration by Los Angeles
Police Department officers, who
urged him not to buckle under
pressure and to retain his post.
Gates has been under fire since
last week, when four officers
violently beat a motorist.

Yesterday’s Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette ran parts of the transcript
of the conversation between one
of the officers in question and the
dispatcher. The officer stated,
“Oops  I haven't beaten anyone
this bad in a long time.”
Unfortunately, though the words
were different, the dispatcher’s
general attitude was, “Tsk, tsk,
bad police officer.”

Mind you, this is a man who is
supposed to uphold the law.

Whether or not this attack was ,

racially motivated is irrelevant.
The problem lies with the poor
relationship between the law
enforcement and the public. As
stated in yesterday’s editorial,
somewhere along the line
someone in power screwed up,
and the world has been paying
for itever since. Something needs
to be done to gain the trust of
both sides, so that law
enforcement can do what it is
supposed to and uphold the law
rather than break it to gain the
upper hand over civilians.

0 Speaking oflaw enforcement,
The Pitt News ran a story
yesterday about a stabbing on
Bouquet Street on Friday. Most of
the information from that story
came from city police reports.
Very little came from campus
police.

Now, if that stabbing had
occurred on campus, do you think
that we would have found out
about it other than from
secondhand reports from
witnesses? No, neither do I.
Anybody who believes that
campus police, even when it did
release reports, showed us every
report is extremely naive.

 

Jeff
Tatusko

This goes back to my earlier
comments. Trust has to start
somewhere. But through time,
the police forces of the world
became suspicious of the media,
and vice versa. Now, I’m not
suggesting that the media are
correct in all cases, either. But in
a world where mistrust and
cynicism are rampant, isn’t it time
for us to realize that nobody’s
perfect?

-The Soviet Union is going to
stay intact, at least for the time
being.

The Supreme Soviet announced
yesterday that the people of the
Soviet Union want to remain a
unified country. Had they voted
no, the country probably would
have collapsed, leading to open
civil strife. Big surprise” They
voted against civil war.

According to my cohort,
Professor Richter, Mikhail
Gorbachev received a C minus
for his crackdown on the Baltic
states. And although he has a
point, Gorbachev cracked down
in an effort to preserve his country.
National unity supersedes all
arguments as to whether or not
the states are legally part of the
Soviet Union. (Isn’t it nice to be
able to publicly disagree with
professors?)

Besides, at this point, I would
rather have a stable Soviet Union
than an unstable one. And
although Mother Russia isn’t
exactly a bastion of stability, a
civil war could lead to disastrous

consequences for the entire
world.

-Don’t look now, but this gulf
thing might not be over just yet.

Under the current rules of
engagement in the region,
American helicopters are
permitted to shoot down armed
Iraqi choppers if they are deemed
a threat.

Now, call me a pessimist, but
who’s to say that Saddam Hussein
might not send a small helicopter
force against ours, get them shot
down and start this all over again
—— this time ﬁghting solely in
Iraq? You have to admit, it's a hell
of a way to get world support.

Frankly, though, I can’t see his
people going for it. Seeing as
they are currently trying to gain
their own power over Saddam,
this conflict would be quick and
painful for them, and I tend to
think they know that.

-1 don’t know, maybe it’s just
because I’m a guy, but I think that
the National Enquirer has taken
this Gen. Schwarzkopf hype just
a little too far.

The cover of this week’s issue
says that Schwarzkopf is one of
America's sexiest men. Now
granted, Schwarzkopf is one of
the top minds in the U.S. military
and has a genius—level IQ. He
may even run for president one
day and with the success of the
war, he would probably win on
that basis. But calling him one of
America’s sexiest men doesn’t
help the war effort; it makes a
mockery of it.

-Finally, since everybody else
is doing it, I’ll make my pick for
the NCAA tournament. UNLV will
beat Arkansas by 12 in the ﬁnal
game.

Of course, seeing as I know as
much about basketball as I do
about the sexiest men in America,
this prediction is highly subject to
question. (And yes, I do realize
that I am wearing an Indiana shirt
in my picture.)

Midterms...  
World leaders graded on their performance in key areas

You can feel it in the air. The local 7-
Eleven is selling out of caffeine—laced
foodstuffs daily (actually nightly). Students
sign away their souls in order to gain some
time on a computer in David Lawrence
Hall. Jolt replaces Budweiser as the
preferred college beverage. That’s right,
folks. Midterm time is here again.

But Pitt students weren’t the only ones
who had to endure this torture. Last week,
a few world leaders were put through
examinations and evaluations, courtesy of
yours truly. Sometime around 2 a.m. last
Wednesday (I was doing a philosophy
paper —- the best time to do one), I
decided to subject George Bush, Mikhail
Gorbachev and a few others to midterrns,
something long overdue for them.

Bush was a difficult one to contact. At
first he told me that the timetable I set for
him wasn’t acceptable, so he wouldn’t be
able to return his test on time. So, being
the benevolent columnist that I am, I gave
him an extra week.

But you know heads of state. Give ‘em
an inch, and they’ll take a small nation.
After the extended deadline, Bush called
me and told me his exam was on its way
but had been held ‘up by Congress. I
immediately docked his grade for using
really lousy excuses.

Enough of that, though. Everyone’s dying
to find out how he did, right? OK, here are
his grades: (Remember. You saw it here
first.)

In Rhetoric and Communications, the

Adam
Richter

president received a C—plus. Sure, he made
a lot of good speeches during the Iraq
crisis, but his technique grew old fast.
Besides, I think my Dalmatian could sound
more intimidating than Bush did, even
when he tried.

If he wants to improve his rhetoric skills,
I recommend the president drop his
citizenship and become either a Latin
American revolutionary or the ruler of a
small Communist country.

I gave Bush an A in Military History.
Hey, the guy earned it when he said
Desert Storm would not be another
Vietnam. I have to admit, it was pretty
darn perceptive of him to point out that
the two wars weren't even fought in the
same place.

So far, George Bush gets a B overall. But
while his re-election is all but set in stone,
he has a lot of work to do if he wants to
make dean’s list. Still, he didn’t fare too
badly compared to some other world
leaders.

Carlos Menem, the president of
Argentina, scored a C-minus in Economics.
I tried to be lenient, but when you're
dealing with the leader of a country where
“hyperinﬂation” is a household name, it’s
hard to be generous with grades. According

to the December edition of Atlantic,
inflation in Argentina by the end of 1990
was projected to be around 5,000 percent.
Sufficient food for a family costs less than
$300 a month, but even professionals,
such as lawyers and doctors, earn less
than $200.

On the other hand, the people in
Argentina supposedly still believe in
Menem. For that, he gets a B in Public
Relations. I

Mikhail Gorbachev will really have to
cram come finals time. In Economics, the
guy has a D, pretty much for making the
Soviet Union’s economy look about as
bad as that of Argentina. He got an A in
Soviet Politics, but the results of that
country’s recent referendum may change
this. His treatment of the Baltic states
definitely hurt his Public Relations midterm.
In this I only gave him a C~minus.

Only one national leader flunked
Fundamentals of Democratic Reform --
Deng Xiaoping. Unlike his Eastern
European classmates, the Chinese premier
has yet to grasp the concept of crowd
control, much less popular opinion. I'm
afraid Chairman Deng had better transfer
to a smaller realm of international affairs
before it’s too late.

Of course, Saddam Hussein (You know,
the Bad Boy of Baghdad) didn’t fare much
better. In Rhetoric, the Iraqi leader gets an
A. (“Columns of bodies"—I love it!) But he
could learn a lot from Gorbachev in public
relations when it comes to dealing with

the Kurds. In this subject I had to give the 
guy a D. His Military Strategy grade —— also '
a D —— couldn’t save his average, either. It A

looks like Hussein is going on probation
soon.

All of these grades make it sound like A I

I’m a pretty tough grader. One world

leader, though, did exceptionally well. if

Helmut Kohl of Germany is deﬁnitely

honors-bound. With the reunification of 

Germany, the chancellor gets an A-plus in
both Public Relations and West European
Government.

Not only was he able to unite East and a
West Germany last year, he milked that I-
event for publicity so well you’d think he 

performed a miracle. So Saint -—I mean,
Chancellor —— Kohl receives pretty high
marks this time around.

Out of all the midterrns I gave to the

leaders of the world, only two never 

responded. Brian Mulroney, the prime
minister of Canada, threw out my midterm
offer when he saw it was postmarked
“United States of America.” Apparently he
thought it was another cold—blooded
American attempt to steal more of Canada's
hockey players, like we did with Wayne
Gretzky.

I also sent a midterm to Ramiz Alia‘, care
of the Albanian government. It came back
to me shortly after, though, with a stamp
on the envelope that read “Return To
Sender — No Such Address.”

PSfP ‘insulted’ by Posvar's denial of department

I’m writing in response to the
article published Monday, March
18, regarding the military contract
recently accepted by our
university. On behalf of PSfP
(Pittsburgh Students for Peace), I
would like to clarify why this
contract is indeed “appalling.”
Approximately three weeks ago,
PSfP asked Wesley Posvar to help
activate a peace and justice
department at this university. The
group’s position springs from the

fact that while the university A

promotes ROTC and has a number
of defense contracts, they do not
promote any sort of effort to raise
conscientiousness about peace
as an alternative means of
problem-solving. A peace and
justice departmentwould provide
a balance of ideas. While the
university is under financial

But then there are those of you

every day. We’re lucky if we can
get to our 1:00 classes, showered
and awake. We eat breakfast at
noon. We eat lunch at 4:00. And
yes, we’ve also been known to
crave “O” pizza.

So what is it that we do until
4:00 in the morning?

Well, nothing, really. It’s
difficult to study that late at night.
Nothing is on TV, and radio
stations have been known to
play “rock blocks" of songs like
“Ebony and Ivory,” “We Are The
World,” and “The Super Bowl
Shuffle.” Laugh if you will. It

constraints, it does not seem an
unreasonable request that at least
this idea could be looked into.
Mr. Posvar, however, disagrees.
He wrote to PSfP, rejecting our
proposition on the grounds that
"the University of Pittsburgh is an
educational, not a political
institution” Given this direct
quote, it is downright insulting
that he should turn around and
activate military research on
behalf of this school.l...l

that you are dangerously devoid
of any real knowledge of how
the [National Endowment for the

Arts] actually works. I am a film L

major here at the university, and
I can tell you that it costs money
to make films. This money comes
out of my own pocket, and I will
most definitely never break even
when doing small-budget student
filrris. Many times I have had to
abandon a film because of the
problem of not enough or no
money. The NBA helps people

mediums as well, who do not
have the money but do have the
creativity.

“mornin g people. " The difference
is, they watch the sun rise as they
get ready for class. I watch the
sun rise and get ready for bed.
Sunlight isn’t one of those things
I look forward to.

Is this a disease? Is there a cure
for chronic laziness? Maybe.

Someone suggested that I
should register for early classes
for next term, so I would be
“forced” to go to bed early.

Now that those of you like
myself have controlled your
giggling, allow us to chant in

Classes have nothing to do
with my laziness. If I had an 8:00

I get the sense that you feel that
just anybody can send in for a
grant and get it. This is not true.
In all cases a person who is
asking for a grant must enclose
copies of previous works,
credentials and a precise letter
stating if this would be a grant
just to produce, or a grant to
produce a specific piece. And, if
it were to produce a specific
piece, a budget forecast and
treatment for the piece would
also have to be included.

The NBA grants that you have
spoken of, Mr. Alman, have even
had an effect on your life. Many
directors that we see today have,
at one time, been funded by the
NEA. Some of 0 these directors
include George Lucas, Spike Lee,
David Lynch, Oliver Stone and
many others, both large and small.

Therefore, I assume there won’t
be a cure until I get into that “real
world” and get the 9-to-S that my
survival depends on. So for now,
I am content with being an
insomniac. I can deal with it. And
to those of you “morning people"
who enjoy giving me suggestions
on how to be more like you,
keep it to yourself for now. When
I get a real job and I need to wake
up, then you can fill me in on all
of your little secrets.

But, then again, there’s plenty
of night-shift careers. Hmmm  I
like that. Then I’d have a lifetime

Lisa Raﬁ’ is a lazy column is: for
The Pitt News.

I cannot say that if these directors
did not get funded they would
not be making films, but I know
for a fact that it is a lot easier to
make a quality film if one does
not have to worry as much about
its budget.

I sincerely ask you, Mr. Alman,
in the future to think a little
deeper about how things actually,
relate to you. No man or woman
is alone in this world, and even if
you do not think so, all humans

are interrelated. We would all be ,
shallower, smaller people if we .

did not have the arts, and our
country recognizes this. This is
why the NEA exists and should
keep continuing to exist.

The plan also includes improved
maintenance of the William Pitt
Union, shuttle buses to all Pitt
home games and an increase in
Pitt taxi services.

These programs are just ideas,
and “nothing is written in stone,”
said Brent Saunders, SGB
president.

Saunders said that initial
responses to the poll were
overwhelmingly positive. Results
of the poll will be available next
week.

Pitt student Glenn Rosen said,
“I’d be willing to pay because the
campus is in need of these
improvements.”

Mark Devich, another Pitt
student, said, “We pay for football
tickets, so why not pay for
basketball tickets?”

If student reactions are negative,
then the SGB will not go through
with the program, according to
Saunders.

“Now is the time for the students
to voice their opinion,” Saunders
said.

Saunders said he is soliciting
student opinions before any
policy goes into effect. This poll
gives students a chance to
respond to the SGB, he said.

For the past few years, the

“It’s been a couple of years

Ligons hopes the BAS continues

Front office spells Pens’ success

It is March, and the Penguins

. are in first place. This is not a

misprint or a dream; it is real.
This is the same team that as
recently as the beginning of this
season had a defense on the
same level as the Pitt basketball
team. In other words ——
nonexistent. This team actually
missed the playoffs last year. A
high-school team could probably
make the NHL playoffs, but not
last year’s Pens. How have they
become a contender so fast?

One answer is Coach Bob
Johnson. For years, new Penguin
coach after new Penguin coach
has sworn on his grandmother's
grave, or that of some other dead
relative, that he would make the
Penguins play defense. There
must be quite a few dead relatives
spinning in their graves because
“Badger” Bob is the first one to
actually accomplish_ this feat.
Believe it or not, even Mario
Lemieux is playing great defense
lately.

More importantly are the recent
acquisitions made by General
Manager Craig Patrick. Before
the season, he brought in veterans
Joey Mullen and Brian Trottier.
Mullen helped keep the Pens
together during their early—season
struggles before a knee injury
took him out of the lineup. Trottier
has given them solid play at both
ends of the ice. He has provided
leadership. Most of all he brings
toughness and respect.

Even though Trottier is no
longer the offensive force he was
early in his career, he is still one
of the most respected players in
the league.

A good example came in

Ryan
Buncher

Sunday's game against the
Rangers. When New York center
Bernie Nicholls got a little too
rough, Trottier confronted him.
Most players would be told to go
do something obscene with their
mother, but Nicholls backed off.

Patrick has continued to make
solid deals all year. The Penguins
needed a tough defenseman, so
he got Peter T aglianetti. In the
same deal, he acquired another
consistent blue-liner, who is also
a good scorer, in Larry Murphy.
When the time came to unload
the one-dimensional Rob Brown,
he was able to get versatile Scott
Young, who has contributed to
the improved defense and even
done some scoring.

Patrick also got center Jiri
Hrdina. The Czechoslovakian has
been surprisingly productive. He
has accomplished what he was
acquired for — to be a
combination translator—buddy for
rookie Jaromir Jagr. Jagr has
blossomed since his fellow
countryman arrived. People forget
how comforting that could be,
and thatJagr is only 19 Years old.

The topper is the recent trade
that sent John Cullen, Zarley
Zalapski and Rick Parker to
Hartford in exchange for center
Ron Francis and defensemen
Grant Jennings and Ulf
Samuelsson. The immediate
success of the deal is apparent. In
eight games since the swap, the
Pens have won six, lost one, and

tied one. The long-terrn effects
are in question.

Penguin followers question the
deal because of Cullen's talent
and popularity. He has become
one of the top centers in the NHL.
Another reason is Zalapski’s skill.

An answer is that these players’
most important value is on
offense, something the Penguins
have plenty of. A scoring
defenseman like Zalapski is very
valuable to Hartford, but the Pens
have Paul Coffey, Murphy and
sometimes Young to fill that role.

Francis can score, but he puts
his defensive responsibility first.
Samuelsson and Jennings won’t
score much, but they are very
good on the defensive end and
give the Pens a more physical
defense. Remember, at the time
of the trade, the status of tough
guy Taglianetti was questionable
because of a punctured lung.

The team did lose some youth.
Francis is 32 years old. Cullen is
26, and Zalapski is only 22. But
this is a trade for now. The
Penguins are a serious contender,
so it is not such a bad idea to give
up a little youth to improve the
team.

The Penguins aren't exactly
ancient T rottier and Mullen, both
34, are the only players showing
signs of age. Of the team's top
players, Coffey is the oldest after
Francis at age 29. Lemieux is 26.
All—stars Mark Recchi and Kevin
Stevens.are 23 and 25 years old,
respectively. Goalie Tom Barrasso
is 25.

The team also has two
outstanding rookies in Jagr and
23-year-old defenseman Paul
Stanton.

Yet another record for gymnasts

By John Labriola
Sta1flVriter

The Lady Panthers’ gymnastics
team ended its regular season on
a good note Monday night at
Trees Hall, when it defeated the
Mountaineers of West Virginia
University 186.90 to 186.50.

In its last home meet, the Pitt
squad once again broke the
school’s team record of 186.65,
the fifth time the team has
accomplished that this season.

The Lady Panthers opened
Monday's meet by paying tribute
to their five graduating seniors:
Robyn Borchers, Came Camesale,
Chris Petro, Tina Taylor and Kathy
Wallish.

‘We beat WVU finally, after
being so close,” said Wallish.

The meet opened with Pitt
working on the vault while WVU
warmedupontheuneven parallel
bars. The Lady Panthers
performed their vaults more
strongly than they have in the
past two meets, but it was not
enough to pull ahead of the
Mountaineers, who scored a 46.55
on bars.

The Pitt vaulting squad tied its
season-high vaulting score of
46.45 that it set during the meet

against Ball State. Turning in
strong vaults for Pitt were
Carnesale (9.40), Taylor (9.30),
Wallish (9.30), Gina Venezia
(9.25) andJeanne Vecchio (9.20).

The second round of the meet
found the Lady Panthers working
the uneven bars while the
Mountaineers worked the vault
The Pitt bars squad has proven
throughout this season that it is
aggressive and able to pull
together through its routines. Pitt
scored a 46.30 on bars, and the
Mountaineers scored a 47.00 on
the vault to widen their lead to
0.80.

Turning in strong bar
performances for Pitt were
Vecchio (9.65), Taylor (9.35),
Karen Jorgensen (9.20), Wallish
(9.20) and Carnesale (8.80).

In the third round of
competition, the Mountaineers’
luck took a turn for the worse.
Yvette Clark, who was performing
in the all-around event, injured
her heel in a freak accident while
warming up for the floor
exercises. As a result, the Lady
Panthers were given a one-person
advantage over the Mountaineers.
For the next two rounds of
competition, WVU would be
competing with only five

gymnasts instead of six.

During the third round of
competition, the Lady Panthers
were able to narrow the
Mountaineers’ lead down to 1.20
points by scoring a 46.30 on the
balance beam. WVU scored a
46.85 on the ﬂoor.

The Lady Panthers’ beam
performances were strong. Tight
performances were turned in by
Vecchio (9.60), Kristen Brown
(9.50), Venezia (9.25), Carnesale
(9.20) and Taylor (8.90).

The ﬁnal round of competition
for the Lady Panthers was the
floor exercise, in which they
scored a 47.70, while the
Mountaineers scored a 46.10 on
the beam.

“Actually, it wasn’t our best
performance, but we came back
strong on the floor. That's what
paid off,” said Tina Taylor.

The Lady Panthers’ ﬂoor squad
had improved and gained a
greater following as the season
wore on. Monday found the
audience clapping along with the
Lady Panthers’ floor music.

‘Awesome. We did great,” said
Camesale. ‘On ﬂoor we've been
doing awesome. Everyone hasn’t

Panthers’ win sired/e
snapped at six games

Jn I-Iii‘ lman/l A ‘h flew

Starting pitcher Ron Rojtas was part of a Panther pitching staff
that was shelled for 15 runs yesterday against Slippery Rock.

By Chris Kuzneski
sum’ Writer

After winning its last six
games, the Pitt baseball team
was confident going into
yesterday's game against the
Slippery Rock University
Rockets.

Maybe too confident.

The Panthers’ pitching staff
was rocked for 15 runs,
including six in the decisive
sixth inning, as Pitt (8-9) lost
its first home game of the ~
year, 15-11.

“We played terrible,
nowhere near the way we've
played in our last six games,”
said Panther pitcher Dennis
Terzich. “We didn’t come to
play. We just showed up
expecting to win.”

Pitt seized an early 1-0 lead,
but then the pitching staff
faltered, giving up nine runs
in the first five inningsand the
Panthers found themselves
behind 9-4.

With one out in the bottom
of the fifth, reserve infielder

Bryan Henne was called on to
pinch-hit with the bases
loaded, and he delivered a
game-tying grand slam. It
appeared that Pitt was on the
verge of another big win, but
it was not to be.

“It was the big hit of the
game,” said Terzich, “but we
still managed to lose
somehow.”

Pitt scored two more runs
in the inning and led 11-9
after ﬁve, but the pitching
staff faltered again.

Terzich was called in with
two on and no one out in the
top of the sixth inning, but he
was unable to hold the lead.

“It was the fifth time in five
days I’ve been worked,” said
Terzich. “I'm not trying to
make excuses, but my arm
was tired, and I couldn't hit
my spots. When you have no
speed on the ball and can’t hit
your spots, you're in trouble.”

CBS okay, Carolina on the wayup, Evans on the way out

After watching all but about
three hours of CBS’s coverage of
the road to the Final Four, I’m
amazed that I have retained my
sanity. I have to admit, however,
that the games and players started
to run together last Saturday.
About that time, I began to watch
things other than the games
themselves.

One other note: The CBS
coverage of the tournament has
been great. Their ability to stagger
starting times of the games is
heaven for us basketball junkies.
This way you do not have to
listen to Chris Berman and Dick
Yitale while waiting for a game to
start. Whenjim Nantz, Billy Packer
and Mike Francesa do stop to
preview and review a game, it’s
short and to the point. llere’s
some of the highlights and low
spots for this year’s spectacle.

Best Games:

0 Syracuse vs. Richmond —
The No. 15 Richmond Spiders
whipped the mighty Syracuse
Orangemen by playing ball-
control offense and crashing the
boards. What a concept. This was
one of the biggest upsets in
tournament history. No 15 seed
had ever won before since the
tournament expanded to 6/! teams
in 1985. Richmond was the perfect
candidate to be the first. It has a
history ofbeating the big teams at
tournament time. Whatever
happened to the Syracuse team
that put on the dunkfest against
the hapless Panthers at the Carrier
Dome at the end of February?
After winning the Big East regular-
season title, the Orange seemed
to have decided to take the rest of
the year off, figuring that it could
just slide by. It should have
learned after its first-round Big
East tournament loss to Villanova.
Oh, well. I guess what they say
about Jim Boeheim not being
able to manage a team in the
tournament is true, after all.

0 Iowa vs. East Tennessee State
—— Another David vs. Goliath
scenario, only this time Goliath
won. ETSU, like Richmond, has a
history of being a first-round
spoiler, and it almost pulled it off
again. It led most ofthe game but
fell apart after its leader, Mister
(Keith) Jennings, fouled out,
ending a great season for him
and his Buccaneer teammates.

o Villanova vs. Princeton ——
If you like coaching clinics and
crisp passing rather than fast
breaks and slam dunks, this one
was for you. Too bad Princeton
couldn’t hit a shot to save its life
in the second half, or the team
might have broken 55 points.
The last-second heroics of ‘Nova
forward Lance Miller was the
icing on the cake of a dandy of a
game.

— Don’t laugh. While the final
score wasn’t as close as some of

Bulls defeat Blazers in closest game of MILL season

By Ethan Lott
Sta_ﬁ' Writer

Despite playing without their
second-leading scorer, John
Wilson, the Pittsburgh Bulls
pulled off the closest Major
Indoor Lacrosse League game of
the year Sunday night, defeating
the New England Blazers 12-11
in overtime.

In sudden death, Brian Nikula

scored the game-winning point,
his fourth on the night, and tallied
the game MVP for his
performance.

The Bulls got a St. Patrick’s
Day gift when the final goal
deflected off Blazers’ goalie Bruce
Donaldson and trickled in. “We
ﬁnally got a lucky break,” Nikula
said.

The Bulls jumped out to an
early 3-] lead and led 7-6 at the

losing close games in Philly and
Baltimore this month, the Bulls
couldn’t relax.

The Bulls ended up trailing
11-10 late in the game, but Pat
Lamon scored his third goal on
the night with time running out
in regulation, setting the stage
for Nikula’s heroics.

Bulls’ general manager

Haswell Franklinjr, said he was

was especially happy with
Nikula’s play. “Nikula stepped

Nikula led the league in goals
scored with 20.

killing penalties, allowing the
Wings to score three power-play
goals. Against the Blazers, the

“The keys for us were that we

Nikula said.

already is the all—time winningest
team in NCAA history. It appears
ready to make a record 10th
appearance in the Final Four.
Richmond’s Dick Tarrant and
Seton Hall’s P.J. Carlesimo also
have gotten the most out of the
talent they have available to them.
Oh, the coach of that school out
in the desert of Nevada is pretty
darn good, too.

Worst Tournament Coach:
Definitely a toss-up between
Boeheim and Pitt’s Paul Evans.
Boeheim’s woes are well-
documented. Evans should be
fired for his tournament
performances and his blatant
inability to use his players’
basketball talents. CBS’s Billy
Packer made the statement that
perhaps Pitt’s seniors have been
underachievers because they
were overrated.

That is entirely possible, but
let’s think back to when Evans
first arrived. He had a starting
team that consisted of Charles
Smith, one of the NBA’s premier
young forwards, Jerome Lane,
Demetreus Gore, Curtis Aiken
and Mike Goodson.

This was the team that lost to
Oklahoma (when the Sooners

were still a year away from .

national prominence) in the

second round of the NCAAs in

Evans’ first year. The next year,

backcourt, the Panthers were
knocked out by Vanderbilt.
Following that was Ball State,
and now Kansas.

When will people wake up
and realize that Evans is not that
great of a coach? His fulfillment
of expectations is mediocre at
best. Even with David Robinson
at Navy, the farthest the
Midshipmen advanced was to
the Final Eight. This is a pretty
good accomplishment, but
Robinson carried the team that
far single—handedly.

When Robinson left Navy, the
Middies were left ﬂoundering.
Evans can come into a program
and get it back onto its feet by
getting a few recruits.

That, however, seems to be the
extent of his coaching ability.
Evans can build a program, but
he cannot keep up a continuous
streak of successful seasons.
