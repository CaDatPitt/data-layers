Pittdoubles Haiti relief effort

Pitt News

The Daily Student Newspaper of the University of Pittsburg - Vol. 100 - Issue 9' -

.,~.,»< )1, .-:.v.,.

The University buys twice the amount of buckets than originally planned for ‘Bucket Brigade’

Amy Friedenberger
For The Pitt News

The University doubled the size of its
“Bucket Brigade for Haiti,” aproject,
meant to collect supplies for victims
of last week’s earthquake in Haiti. '
Steve Zupcic, assistant director
of Community Relations, said Pitt
has now purchased 1,000 buckets
printed with the University’s name.
Student organizations can collect
new items such as baby wipes or wet
wipes, non-liquid soap, washcloths
and toiletries and bring them to a
collection of empty buckets placed
near the main information desk in

the William Pitt Union. Items that

‘could leak, such as shampoo, won’t

be accepted.

Haitian families will be able
to keep both the supplies and the
buckets, which they can use to col-
lect clean drinking water.

“The Bucket Brigade is something
the students can do,” Zupcic said.
“Filling those buckets is not some-
thing that is expensive.”

The Brother’s Brother Founda-
tion, a North Side-based group that
promotes international health and
education by donating medical, edu-
cational and other supplies to people
in need, will pick up the buckets Feb.

8 and send them to Haiti.

The University might extend the

deadline if student interest grows.
V Zupcic said employees in the
School of Medicine ﬁlled 12 of the
buckets and that he has received
more than 40 calls from University
organizations hoping to help the
drive.

The University purchased the
ﬁrst 500 buckets and placed them
throughout campus and resident
halls earlier this week.

Zupcic said the campaign would
have had a quicker start, but the Uni-
versity had trouble ﬁnding buckets.

They seemed to be in high demand I

after the Brother’s Brother Founda-
tion requested donations.
Zupcic said Pitt “has worked

a with Brother’s Brother extensively

every year” and that he hopes this
campaign will spark further student
interest in the organization and in
Haiti. " >
“I would like the student interest
to continue even after the Bucket Bri-
gade is over, and I would like for the
students to continue to be supportive
of those suffering in Haiti,” Zupcic
said. “When the earthquake is in the
past — at least a year from now —-— I
would like the students to make an
effort to ﬁnd out what’s going on.”

"Sudanese child slavery

survivor Simon Deng

‘ Five dollars will buy four candy bars,

1.78 gallons of gasoline or one milk-
shake from Dave and Andy’s.

For years, it was also the price of
a slave in southern Sudan.

Simon Deng might have been an
exception to the system. When Deng
was 9, a man abducted him from
Malkal, the city where his Chris-
tian family was taking reﬁige from
someArab men of northern Sudan
who were pillaging his hometown.
Dengbecame a slave for his kidnap-
per’s relatives.

“At that time, I knew only one
word, and that is ‘yes’ — ‘yes’ to ev-
erything,”‘said Deng, who is now in
his late 40s.

, He was the ﬁrstto wake up in the
morning. He was the last to go to bed.

, He slept with the family’s animals.
“At the age of 9, what do you have i

to do?” Deng asked a crowd of about
150 people gathered in the William
Pitt.Unionlast night. “I cannot defend
myself. A111 can do is cry for mercy,
and that mercy is not there.” I

How to get a global education  

The Study Abroad Office will host an International Fair today in the Union

Megan Kelly
For The Pitt News

An event today will feature study abroad
programs for Pitt credit, as well as differ-
ent ways to ﬁnd international classes and
activities on campus.

Similar to a career or volunteer fair,
the Study Abroad Ofﬁce’s International
Fair will feature different stations for stu-

dents to browse, such as language centers
from the English Language Institute and
food for sale by the English Language As-
sociation.

Ben Pilcher, outreach assistant for the I

office, said students will prepare food
from their native countries to sell at the
fair, and all of the proceeds will beneﬁt a.
food bank in Pittsburgh.

The ofﬁce hosts an international fair
each term, and thisjanuary, the staff hopes

to bring in about 800 students.

' The International Fair serves to educate
students about the global opportunities
Pitt offers and how students can globalize
their major.

Students can explore their opportuni-
ties in the Union’s Assembly Room from
11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today.

“We really want students to learn the
meaning of international education,”
Pilcher said.

He told himself he’dpnever speak about his

badge of honor. Slavery is taboo, and I don’t

Inspections unnecessary  

 
  

Jacob Brown
Columnist

Being an Ohioan isn’t easy. My
friends here often take jabs at my

roots, citing some of Ohio’s famous I

faults, such as Cleveland — other-
wise known as “ the mistake on the

- lake” — and its sports teams, or the

infamous environmental catastrophe
when the Cuyahoga River caught ﬁre
in1969. ‘

To retaliate, I’ve occasionally sent
these same friends pictures of the
Buckeye state’s forbidden fruit like

thebeerandliquoraisle atWal—Mart I

back home. I mostlytryto disregard
the foibles of our respective states,
though.

That is, until now. I say that pri-
marily because a questionable lapse
in Pennsy1vania’s state regulations
could have killed me a few weeks
ago.

Let me explain. Last August, I
purchased a used car to replace the
aging jalopyl had owned since high
school. The previous owner of my

‘ a new carbabied it, having it inspected

just before I boughtyit. V
While purchasing a used car is
always a gamble, I bought into the

popularized claim that Pennsylva-

nia’s supposedly rigorously inspected
vehicle market would supply me with
abetter carthan Ohio could. We don’t
have inspections back home.

I had nothing to worry about —— ’

or so I thought. But a month later,
most of the brake components failed
and needed to be replaced.

And this month, the brakes
stopped working again, forcing me
to replace almost every other pre-

cu

I had nothing to
worry about — or so I
thought.

viously unchanged part. Since Sep-
tember, I’ve effectively doubled my
investment in the car.

Fortunately, my car’s brake lines
and wheel cylinders burst in a park-
ing lot, leaving me there to roll to a
standstill. Had I been in trafﬁc at the

time, I might not have come away

unscathed. V
According to a study by Cam-

 see/zcesza
MCT Campus

bridge Systematics, atransportation
analysis company thathas worked to
analyze the effectiveness of Pennsyl-
vaniacar inspections, the state’s vehi-
cle safety inspections avert between
115 and 169 fatal accidents annually.

What might not be obvious is that, .

unlike the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration or the Insur-
ance Institute for Highway Safety,

Cambridge Systematics is a for-proﬁt .

institution.

I tried several times to contact '

Jay Evans, a top consultant for Cam-
bridge Systematics in the Mid-Atlan-
tic Region, to see how his company
could report its ﬁndings without bias,
but I received no comment. Of the
sources the corporation cited in the
report, 12 of the 17 were more than
15 years old. In fact, only four of their

SOLIFCES were CVEII ff om research

conducted after 2000.

Washington’s city council couldn’t
justify keeping its similar program,
so it stopped inspectingvehicles last
October. The phaseout came both as
a cost-cutting measure and because
DC Council couldn’t conclude that
its 81-point inspection really kept
motorists safer, according to The
Washington Post.

“It’s a really burdensome require-
ment on drivers that has no effect,”
the District’s DMV director, Lucinda

Motor inspections don’t make drivingsafer

Brown 4 6

Babers, told The Washington" Post.
It seems Pennsylvania chooses
to keep these inspections not be-
cause they serve to better the driv-
ing environment. Rather, they can
generatelnear $250 million for the
state, according to a study released
by PennDOT, They can also send tax
revenue back to the state and munici-
palities by requiring often expensive
and unnecessary vehicle repairs,
While I’ve heard people say that

Ohioans drive death traps, I canveri-
fy that my old cars brakes never went
kaput on me without notice, nor had
the car ever been a safety hazard.

If Pennsylvania really wanted its
drivers to be safer, a more effective
approach might be to improve driver
education — not mandating inspec-
tions. Just as you go to the doctor
when you’re sick, individuals will
have the sense to go to the mechanic
when their cars are no longer road-

worthy. A . .
According to a 2009 study from
GMAC Insurance surveying general
driving knowledge, Pennsylvania
ranks as possessing the 16th-worst
drivers in the nation — a rating lower
than Ohio, believe it or not. Pennsyl-

vanians answered just 75.4 percent

of the questions correctly.
That means that there’s a good
chance that overconﬁdent drivers

clue what to do if they ever encounter
a catastrophic mechanical failure on
the open road. Somehow, that doesn’t
give me a sense of security.
However, rather than mitigate the
lack of driver preparation, Pennsyl-
vaniawill continue to hide behind the
myth that vehicle inspections really
make everyone safer. Much like what
I’ve encountered on the local level
here, the state’s philosophy seems to

better than its citizens when it comes
to what’s best for society.

So Pennsylvanians, please for-
give me. In mostways, I like this state
much more than Ohio. But if ever I
had to choose between a few sports
championships or dealing with less
government bullying, I think I’d
choose the latter.

Your car stop working, too? Call

most likely won’t have the slightest

Webmaster of love: alumnaunveils new site

Natalie Bencivenga, Pitt ’06, wants to help young couples find relationship advice‘

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

Relationships. They give singles
headaches and frustrate couples.
But for one Pitt alumna, they are
inspiration for her new online
publication, twodaymag.com.

Founded by editor Natalie
Bencivenga and managing editor
Joseph Vineis, twoday magazine
is taking the step from a monthly
webzine to a full—time website and
operating magazine Jan. 18.

Bencivenga, a Pitt grad, de-
scribed twoday magazine as a
progressive publication that could
affect changes in relationships of
couples .of all ages.

“Nothing [in other magazines]
really fused  questions about
dating, about gay and straight
dating,” Bencivenga said. “[These
are] the questions that never get
asked and never get answered in
magazines  I think we’re still
very isolated even when we have
a partner. This is a way to change
it up a bit.” '

The new site features material
that couples can read together
rather than separately, which sets
it apart from the typical print style
magazine. The publications will

provide a guide for couples that

can be-updated daily.
, The magazine targets people
age 20 and older, according to

especially, because they are just
ﬁnding their footing and what
they want in life.”

Twodaymag, based in a New
York oﬂice, launched its revamped‘
website onJan. 18. It now includes
new articles about restaurants,

places to go together, interactive .

Don’t expect Globes to pick Wisely  

 

Kieran Layton
A8E Editor

  

This year, Sandra Bullock (best
known for her work as a butch-
cop-turned-beauty-queen in
“Miss Congeniality”) was the
best actress in a dramatic role
because she bleached her hair
and struggled through a Texan
accent —— at least according to
the Hollywood Foreign Press As-

' sociation.

Once again, the Golden Globes
proved to viewers that not only
should the HFPA reevaluate its
position as a group of critics of
quality and talent, but it should
probably stop giving out those
garish globes altogether.

Sure, the Golden Globes have a.

long—standing tradition of being

the “fun awards show,” but I find
nothing enjoyable about watching
seriously talented actresses Carey
Mulligan and Gabby Sidibe have
their stellar performances in “An
Education” and “Precious,” re-
spectively, overlooked in favor of
a mainstream joke of an actress.

The Best Performance“ by
an Actress in a Motion Picture
— Drama category was not the
only laughably tragic slight dur-
ing the show. “The Hangover,”
while a very funny ﬁlm, beat out
rom-com innovator “(500) Days

of Summer” and critical Meryl

Streep darlings “It’s Complicat-
ed” and “Julie &Julia.”

Jeff Bridges beat Oscar front-
runners George Clooney and Co-
lin Firth for Best Performance
by an Actor in a Motion Picture

— Drama. Toni Collette robbed the
Best Performance by an Actress in
a Television Series — Comedy or
Musical from the more deserving
Edie Falco (“Nurse Jackie”) and
Tina Fey (“30 Rock”).

I vow not to go into A
‘ A the show with any
real expectations.

And though I love Chloe Sevi-
gny in “Big Love,” Jane Lynch’s

Sue Sylvester on “Glee” is a role J

perfectly tailored to her — that
she didn’t win is absurd.

Of course, I am probably get-
ting too worked up over some-
thing that many — especially
Academy Awards voters — never
take too seriously. However, it’s

, disheartening to see what is ar-

guably the second most popular
awards show miss the opportu-

_nity to place the most deserving

performers, ﬁlms and television
shows as front-runners for the
Oscars and —- down the road —
the Emmys. '

It wasn’t all bad, though. My -

fanboy self was giddy overJames
Cameron receiving the Best Direc-
tor award for the thrill ride that
is “Avatar,” even if his acceptance
speech was a little smarmy. And

“Glee” winning Best Television
Series — Comedy or Musical made
me want to jump for joy and burst
into my own rendition of “Don’t
Stop Believing.” -

Ricky Gervais hosted the
event, and while I suppose he was
adequate, I was disappointed by
his performance in addition to
the actual award winners. Seri-
ously, Jay Leno/Conan O’Brian
jokes were old before the con-
troversy surrounding them ven
started. _

Next year, I vow not to go into
the show with any real expecta-
tions. At its best, the Globes are
just an excuse to watch celebrities
get drunk and feel self-important,
even if they don’t deserve to.

Sandra Bullock, that means
you.

Bridges’ redemption film lacking

’ Without conflict, an antagonist or originality, “Crazy Heart” accomplishes little

Noah Levinson
Staff Writer

“Crazy Heart”
Starring:_]effBridges, Maggie .
Gyllenhaal

Director: Scott Cooper

Studio: Fox Searchlight Pictures
Grade: D

Imagine if Jimi Hendrix, Kurt
Cobain orjohn Lennon were living
today. -

Would they stretch out oldies on

worldwide tours? Would they co1—. .
laborate with Lady Gaga and Ke$ha

to make the Billboard Top 100? Or
maybe they would do a Geico com-
mercial. g

' Itwould be stupid to say the Amer¥
ican culture doesn’t believe the good
die young. It’s rare for pure talent and
creativity to‘ last a lifetime, or even a
decade. _

» But some do attempt to keep on

rockin’ even as the death rattle of .

their career drowns out their perfor-
mance.
Considerjeff Bridges‘, the star of

   

“Crazy Heart”

Bridges stars as Bad Blake, a
once—famous country music star
who performs in bowling alleys and
small-town bars to keep out of bank-
ruptcy. ‘

B1ake’s got nothing going for him
until he does an interview for a band
mate’s niece, a spunky “go get ’em”
journalist played by Maggie Gyllen—
haal. '

This movie involves more people,
like afellow countrystar played by Co-
lin Farrell and an old bartender friend
performed by Robert Duvall —‘—— but
they’re unimportant. ’

Actually, nothing is important in
this movie.

People have hailed Bridges’ per-
formance as virtuoso, but one good
actor cannot save this stink hole of
astory. V

Hollywood reuses the tale of r —
demption like it reuses Nicolas Cage.
It keeps bringing back the basic out-
line of the story,‘ but its efforts go un-
noticed. .

Why? Because Hollywood tries to

make it different. It gives the storyﬂair _

—— or in terms of Cage, a moustache.
Every redemption story has the
initial heap of misery and regret.
Then, the naive young person slowly
reaches adulthood and makes the old
fart change and then usually avenge
some evilrival who has made itinthe
world, but through corrupt means.

_Sounds familiar, right‘? Remem— A

ber Pixar’s “Up”? I’llbetyou-do. Same
story, but with a twist.

. The guy’s in ahouse with balloons
and there are talking dogs, jokes and
Toucan Sam birds. The ﬁlmmakers
cleverly hide the redemption story
so that viewers don’t notice the re-
petitiveness.

But “Crazy Heart” doesn’t cover
it up. Heck, it’s running bare naked
through the Southwest. This movie
sings stereotypical redemption. The
only story pointthe directors change
is that instead of an evil rival, there’s
justarival. '

‘ The story has no conﬂict. There’s

no antagonist, unless you wantto call .

it alcoholism orBad Blake himself. But
that’sjus_t dumb.
Bridges does a pretty good job

playing a mean, rundown country
music singer, but that provides no

- foundation for a film.

Meanwhile, Gyllenhaal acts like
she’s reading cue cards hidden in
Bridge’s unkempt beard, and Farrell
doesn’t even take off his shirt.

“Crazy Heart” is repetitive and
boring. It has scenes upon scenes of
country music performances that all
end up mimicking one another end—

After losing to Georgetown despite leading in rebounds, the Panthers need to rethink defensive strategies

Diana Connor I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Gilbert Brown and the Panthers need to step up defensively.

Evan Burgos
Senior Stajf Writer

Ifthere is one thingPitt head coachJa-
mie Dixonpreaches morethananything
else, it’s defense. Going into every game,
Dixon sets ateam goal for the Panthers
to out—rebound their opponent.

On Wednesday against George-
town, Pitt did just that, pulling down
34boards to the Hoyas’ 33. As ituirns
out, though, rebounds aren’t the only
indicator of success. Two nights ago,
the hallmark ofDixon basketballfailed
the Panthers. -

“We win games with defense, but
we lost this game with defense,” Dixon
said following the 74-66 loss.

Dixon said that in games against
Connecticut and Louisville, the most
recent games prior to Wednesday, the
Panthers didn’t defend up to their po-
tential, but came away with victories

nonetheless. Wednesday it caught up
to them.

To have success as the season goes
on, Pitt has to sharpen its defensive
efforts. This team has no chance of

However, the Panthers (11-7, 0-5)
will enter their second and ﬁnal game
of the road trip at Providence (12-6,
3-2) Saturday at 2 pm. with no con-
ference wins and a ﬁve-game losing

Pitt takes on powerful Seton Hall Sunday

,,_,As highest scoring team in the Big East, Seton Hall won’t give Panthers easy avenue to redemption after loss to’Geo'rgetown

Alex Oltmanns
Staﬁ Writer

'73- .»Coming into Big East play, everyone
looked to the culmination of the
ﬁve-game stretch the Panthers just
ﬁnished as a deﬁning point of the
season.

Pitt went 4-1 in that stretch but
Panther fans are about to see thesixth
quality team inarowwhen they travel
to play Seton Hall (10-6, 1-4 Big East)
Sunday at 2 p.m.

Don’t let the Pirates’ record fool
you. They’re for real.

SetonHall boasts the league’s sec-

who comes into the game averaging

23.3 points per game. The team also '

has the Big East’s leading rebounder
in sophomore Herb Pope.
Pope is averaging 11.5 rebounds

per game for the Pirates, but he was.

to go far away to school. He chose
New Mexico State, but after coach
Reggie Theus left for a coaching job
inthe NBA, Pope decided to transfer
to Seton Hall.

We have to work
‘ harder. It’s as
simple as that.

Gilbert Brown '

The Panthers (]5—3, 5-1 Big East)
will need to bounce back and play
better defensively against Seton Hall
than they did against Georgetown
because the Pirates can score in
bunches. In fact, they won against
the Virginia Military Institute Dec. 12
with 134 points, the highest point to-
tal in Seton Hall’s 1o5—year history.

But no one has to tell the Panthers’
players what itwill take to straighten

things out after a tough loss.
“I think We’re going to bounce
back well in practice,” forward Gil-

bert Brown said. “We have to work .  I

harder. It’s as simple as that.”

The Panthers will look for sopho-
more guard Ashton Gibbs to get back
on the right track against Seton Hall
after going 3-16 from the ﬁeld in the

loss to Georgetown. In fact, a lot of '

the Panthers can have abounce back
game on offense against the Pirates.

While Seton Hall is the highest
scoring team in the Big East with 84.7
points per game, it is also giving up
the second most points per game with
74. Comparatively, Pitt gives up 59.1
points per game. . - ,

But not only will the Panthers
beneﬁt from playing one of the worst
defensive teams in the league, they’re
also looking to avenge their ﬁrst loss
in conference play.

“One loss doesn’t mean anything,”

A guardjermaine Dixon said. “We were

looking forward to going undefeated
[in the Big East] but everyone’s good
in this conference, you don’t have a
night off. We’re going to take it out
on Seton Hall.” '

Performance sagging,
Panthers stay positive

Conﬁdence remains that a single win will reverse trend

Women’s basketball < 11

Despite outstanding individual efforts, suchas
redshirtjuniorjania Sims’ 28-pointperfonnance
in Pitt’s ﬁrst loss to West Vrrginiajan. 5, the Pan-
thers have struggled to engage the entire team in
the offensive production. A

The Panthers would have to look back to
their Dec. 29 loss to Duquesne to ﬁnd a game in
which more than one player exceeded the 10-
point mark. ’

Asits recent71—69winagainstSyracuse shows,
Providence is excelling in balanced scoring.

In a victory over the Orange on Tuesday, the
Friars ﬁnished the game with three players con-
t1°ibuting49 of the team’s 71 points.

Marandola led the scoringwith 19 points and
was followed by fellow seniors Emily Cournoyer

and Brittany Dorsey, with 18 and 12 points re-
spectively.

Providence leads the all—time series againstthe
Panthers 27-18. The most recentvictory came last
season when the Friars upset a then-No. 19 Pitt
team at Alumni Hall in Providence, RI. E

Pitt and Providence appeartobe approaching
the middle point of Big East play from different
angles, but the Panthers arefocused on getting
thatﬁrstbigwininatoughconference thatleaves
little  for error.

“In BigEastplay, the teams are smarter, faster
and stronger,” Sims said. “We just need to stay
positive and leamfromwhatweare doinginorder
to get better and get awin. Once we get thatwin,
there will be no looking bac ”

Big players shouldn’ t
be such a big problem  

Although undersized, Panthers should improve defense

Burgos < 11

just eight turnovers. ’

“Defense is the biggest thing,” Dixon said. “I
really thought: our defense would continue to im-
prove  we didn’t get it done.”

What hurt the Panthers most was the perim-
eter play of Georgetown guard Chris Wn'ght, who
torched Pitt for 27 points. After the game, Dixon
lamented the frequency with which Wright was
getting into the lane for easybuckets.

“He hurtus morethanwe’vehadaguyhurtus

. before in penetration,” Dixon said.

Pitt also needsto improve its interior defense.
Smallertiianmostteams, especiallyevidentagainst
aHoyasquadthatb0asts 6-foot-11 stud sophomore
Greg Monroe and juniorjulianvaughn, abruising
6-foot—9 power forward, Pitt usually has to com-
pensate for its lack of size. But the Panthers have
provedthisyearﬂiattheycandefend againstbigger
teams. They showed it against Cincinnati, ateam
with the same kind ofheight and depth atthe four
and ﬁve positions as Georgetown.

But Wednesday the effort was lacking, and it '

was apparentto the Pit: players.

“We didn’t play as strong as we usually do,”
Gilbert Brown said. “We didn’t come out and play
the way we normally play on defense.” .

A GaryMcGhee,Pitt’stallestplayerat6-foot~1o,

was active offensively, but didn’t have enough of

an impact reboundingthe ball. McGhee grabbed -

onlyﬁve rebounds onthe night, while guard Brad
Wanamaker led Pitt with 13. But this season, the
Panthers are hitting the glass by committee and
McGhee is much improved in his physicality and
ability to make a difference helping defend from
the weak side. IfMcGhee can use his size to clog
driving lanes and beneﬁt from easy buckets on
offense, he will be avaluable commodity over the
rest ofthe season. '
