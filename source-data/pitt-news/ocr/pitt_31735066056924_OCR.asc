Oliver Stone said he was not

“We’re facing the most

“This is one of four locations

Deaf and blind communicate with Dexter(ity)

By Phyliss Milligan
Staff Writer

For many, communicating with
friends and family is just a matter of
opening mouths, but for people who
are deaf and blind the process is not as
easy. I
This is the dilemma of‘ an estimated
17,000 people in the United States and

7a dilemma that David Fleming, a Ph.D

mechanical engineering graduate stu-
dent at Northwestern University, said
he hopes to solve.

Fleming, credited with co—designing
Dexter, a robotic finger—spelling hand
that is a communication tool for the
deaf/blind, spoke to members of the
University of Pittsburgh chapter of the
National Society of Black Engineers
and Sigma Beta Epsilon sorority Friday
afternoon.

Fleming, who holds several degrees
including a B.S. in electrical engineer-
ing, an M.A. in architecture and an M.S.

in mechanical engineering, serves as V

the 1993 Honorary Chairperson for
Pitt’s Hand-In-Hand festival that was

held Saturday. , -
His speech,_ entitled “Applications of
Biomechanics in Quality—Life

Advancement of the Physically
Disabled,” stressed the opportunities
and challenges that face students who
enter the growing field of designing
products to help companies and insti-
tutions comply with the Americans
With Disabilities Act. The act, passed in
1990, requires that public places are
accessible to the handicapped.

Fleming urged students to find out
more about the handicapped and their
needs. “We need to know who the
audience is and what their needs are
before we can turn around and design
for them,” he said.

He initially came in contact with the
deaf and blind when he was a part of a
summer program housed in the
Maryland School for the deaf. Because
of that experience he decided to study
sign language. It was also through the
study of sign language that he became
interested in the devices that could
help the handicapped.

Out of that interest came Dexter”,
which was the result of a class project
by Fleming and two other codesigners,
Sheryl Horn and Gregory Walker.

The students were given the chal-
lenge of redesigning Dexter to make
him more flexible, smaller, faster and

Last Year

relatively more portable by the
Rehabilitation Research Center of the
Veterans Administration Medical Center
in Palo Alto, Calif.

“The motions of the hand were not
natural and we were actually pretty
limited in the range of positions that
the fingers could go through. Our goal
was to come up with a new prototype
that would more directly meet the
needs of the deaf/blind,” Fleming said
of the initial prototype.

Dexter uses the American Sign
Language alphabet to communicate
with the deaf/blind. Through a lap top
computer users can type in what they
want to say and the computer translates
the letters into finger positions that
represent those letters in sign lan-
guage.

Throughout the three—month project,
Fleming and the other co-designers
worked in close contact with the dis-
abled. “We went to the deaf/blind com-
munity and asked them what was
important to them, and .that’s how we
came up with the criteria,” he said.

“What a deaf/blind person usually
does is he/she will have a family mem-
ber or interpreter sign into their hand,

Last year alone our growth in commercial

largest. And our $6.5 billion research and
development budget is a full three times the
size of our nearest U.S. competitor.

All of which means that few computer

that the world's biggest computer company is

still home to some of the world's biggest
opportunities.

Greeks sing their Way
to a Win with the oldies

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

The oldies were golden to Pi Kappa
Alpha and Delta Phi Epsilon on Friday
night as they claimed titles in Greek
Sing. Both Greek chapters performed
songs from decades ago on their way to
winning first place in 1993 at Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Auditorium.

For the brothers Pika, it was their
slick ‘70’s style in performing hits from
“Sha-Na-Na” and Grease which earned
them the top honor for fraternities.
According to Pika senior John Gercher,
it was no surprise that the performance
went so well.

“We’ve been practicing twice a week
for at least two months and felt confi-
dent about it,” Gercher said. “We chore-
ographed everything ourselves an-d
thought we were in a decent position to
win tonight.”

Thenight belonged to Delta Phi
Epsilon in sorority competition, who
entertained the crowd of over 1,300
with their rendition of the “Rock
Around the Clock” medley. In their col-
orful “poodle skirts,” the performers
brought the ‘S05 back to the guys and

Speech and
Hearing Clinic
beneﬁts from
student chapter

By Phyliss Milligan
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
student chapter of the
National Speech-Language
Hearing Association (NSLHA)
donated $500 to Pitt’s Speech
and Hearing Clinic. .

“The donation was a part of
a larger movement within
NSLHA chapters across the
country to support hearing
clinics and to assist students
interested in studying audiol-
ogy and speech—1anguage,”
said Emily Crow, vice—presi—
dent of NSLHA.

The donation will be used
to purchase equipment and
supplies for the hearing clin-
ic.

“NSLHA has always been a
very supportive entity here at
the clinic providing us with
volunteers, funds and helping
out when needed,” said Ellen
Cohen, director of the clinic.

The university student
chapter of NSLHA was
formed in 1972 in an effort to
assist students in human com-
munication sciences to have
better access to literature and
increased interaction with
professionals in the field as
well as provide financial sup-
port for student research pro-
jects.

“By NSLHA supporting the
clinic we get to be a part of
the clinic while gaining expe-
rience, and we also get to
provide equipment for the
clinic which will help stu-
dents as well as the profes-
sionals,” Crow said.

supervision are able to assist

gals.

“We chose this music and dance to be
something different and eye-catching,”
Delta Phi Epsilon junior Stacey Hill
said. “It was a difficult routine but
we felt it would get the crowd worked
up and into our performance, and it
did."

The emphasis of Greek Sing is on
teamwork and dedication within each
chapter, according to several Pitt Greek
performers. They said the ability to
convert the practice and hard work to
onstage results is the key to winning.

There was a wide range of acts on the

‘Greek Sing lineup, but the most suc-

cessful were fast-paced and familiar to
the audience.

Phi Delta Theta’s version of “The
Music Man” fell short of earning them a
first place for the second straight event
of Greek Week 1993. The fraternity’s
second-place finish was led by Dave
Maron, who was named Greek God on
Wednesday night.

Kappa Kappa Gamma followed its
second-place finish in Greek Goddess
with second place at Greek Sing and its
performance of “You’ve Gotta Have
Heart” and “Mambo.”

Pitt students and Special

Hall courts yesterday after running
5 kilometers on Saturday in the
final competitive events of Greek
Week 1993.

Beyond the intense basketball
and the laughable obstacle courses
of the games, the Greek Olympiad
served a a deeper purpose. It
brought together the Pitt Greeks
and their charity, Pennsylvania
Special Olympics, to support each
other in events from volleyball to
swimming.

In addition to supporting the
Special Olympics, Pitt Greeks coin-
peted in the Olympiad to earn
points for their respective Greek
chapters.

“It is important that we are help-
ing with the Special Olympics ath-
letes, but the placement of frater-
nities and sororities also counts,”

Pitt Greeks run for

Carlton Urban said. Urban orga-
nized the event with Gretchen

Gruenner, Jen Ames, Larry
Sernovitz and Cesar Fojas.
According to Urban, the

Olympiad makes up 5 percent of
the overall Greek Week scoring.
Fraternities and sororities were
mixed in match groups and com-

peted in tournament style
matchups.
Officials from the Special

Olympics said the competition
level was very good and that Pitt
students took an interest in the
athletes.

“Pitt Greeks showed the utmost
respect for the athletes,” Western
Development Director of Pa.

said. “The athletes were treated as
part of the Greeks and their com-
munity.

UNFORTUNATELX THIS IS WHERE
PEOPLE ARE PUTTING
TOO MANY RETIREMENT DOLLARS.

very year, a lot of people make a
huge mistake on their taxes. They
don't take advantage of tax deferral and
wind up sending Uncle Sam money they
could be saving for retirement.
Fortunately, that 's a mistake you can
easily avoid with TIAA-CREF SRAs.
SRAs not only ease your current tax-
bite, they offer a remarkably easy way
to build retirement income-especially

for the "extras" that your regular pension

and Social Security beneﬁts may not
cover. Because your contributions are
made in before-tax dollars, you pay less
taxes now. And since all earnings on
your SRA are tax-deferred as well, the

money you don't send to Washington
works even harder for you. Down the
road, that can make a dramatic difference

I in your quality of life.

What else makes SRAs so special?
A range of allocation choices-—from the
guaranteed security of TIAA to the
diversiﬁed investment accounts of
CREF's variable annuity-—all backed
by the nation's number one retirement
system.

Why write off the chance for a more
rewarding retirement? Call today and
learn more about how TIAA-CREF
SRAs can help you enjoy many
happy returns.

For The Pitt News

Engineering students have a reason to smile
because this week is Engineer’s Week, which
means professors won’t schedule any exams
and almost all engineering classes will be
cancelled Friday to make for a long weekend.

Each event planned for the week is geared
for the seven participating engineering

. departments to enjoy themselves in good

clean fun and competition.

The winner receives a trophy that has been
passed down for years and “bragging rights”
for his/her department for the next school
year

Engineer’s Week, sponsored by the
Engineering Student Council (ESC), has the
theme of game shows and TV shows this
year. Each department chooses a different
show as its theme, ranging from “Star Trek” to
“Married With Children.”

Today’s event is Monopoly, but instead of
the traditional board game, engineers will use
a Pittopoly board with different buildings and
locations on campus as property. Each
department sends a team and builds the game

Engineering departments

piece from scratch to go along with its
respective theme. This will be held at 1175
Benedum starting at noon.

Tomorrow there will be a blood drive in

- the vending area of Benedum. Participation is

being pushed because of Central Blood
Bank’s blood shortage.

Tuesday is also “Engenuity Day” on which
each department is required to make a car
out of an ordinary mouse trap. The spring of
the trap is what powers the car, and the dis-
tance it travels determines the winner of this
event. . l

“The purpose of this event is for people to
get a chance to use their creative skills,” said
Dorian Moss, chairperson for Engineer’s
Week.

On Wednesday, each department will send
its smartest students to engage in a game of
Jeopardy. To get the faculty more involved,
two teams have been created for them to take
part in the competition.

Both Engenuity and Jeopardy will take
place at 7 p.m. in the Engineering
Auditorium.

The clinic is available
to university staff and
students at reduced

will be held. In this event,
each department will send
its best athletes to partici-

On Friday, “the creative
juices get to flow a little
again,” Moss said. At 10 a.m.
there will be a parade of
ﬂoats created by the depart-
ments, again going along
with their respective themes.

Each ﬂoat will be made on
a flatbed truck with the
parade starting at the
Benedum loading clock. It
will make a circle down
Bouquet Street, Forbes
Avenue, Bigelow Boulevard
and O’Hara Street, ending at
the Learning Research and

the floats will be used as
stages for skits. The skits
will be performed by stu-

will poke fun at the other
competing departments.

There will be a Soap Box

at 9. The departments
update their cars each year
and race down University

To wrap up the week’s
festivities, on Saturday night
is the Engineer’s Ball, a for-

booth set up in Benedum.
Tickets for the ball can also
be purchased at the booth
or in the ESC office. Tickets
are S25 per person or $45

“I think it’s really great
how so many students vol-
unteer their time for a day
like this,” said Rita Patel, a
junior economics major.

The festival began with
a rousing performance
from the Pitt cheerleaders
and band followed by
Beautiful Hands, a group
that uses sign language and
dance to communicate the
meaning of songs. They
focused on the children,
thrilling them with a sign
language version of the ABC
song.

“I think it’s a marvelous
idea because it’s an example
of the caring of the Pitt
students,” said Jo Ann
Woodson, director of
the Office Of Residence
Life. “I’m always in
amazement of the coordina-

tors of the program for
their selfless generosity
and time for providing

a fun day for disabled chil-
dren. lt’s very heartwarm-
ing.“

The food and prizes for the
games were donated by over
22 corporate and individual
sponsors, including the
University of Pittsburgh and
Student Government Board.

“This year it was difficult
because we didn't get
money from United Way

and some of the people
that usually donated, so
we had to send out more
proposals,” Mokelis said.
“But a lot of student organi-
zations donated money to
us, and that helped tremen-
dously.”

David Fleming, honorary
chairperson of the 1993 festi-
val, was invited because of
his work with the handi-
capped. Fleming invented a
robotic hand named Dexter
that will eventually help
deaf/blind people communi-
cate with the world around
them without the use of a
interpreter.

Vanessa Wright, president
of the Sigma Beta Epsilon
sorority, read about
Fleming’s work in an issue of
the National Society 0fBlac£
Engineers. She not only
invited Fleming to come to
the university but her sorori-
ty sponsored his visit.

“I think programs like this
are important because it is
important to extend yourself
wherever you are,"
Chancellor Dennis O’Connoi
said of the festivities. “This
really shows how committed
a lot of our students are tr:
reaching out and extending
themselves, and I think that
its an expression of human
generosity."

through Schenley Park.

Jason Bodnar took first place overall before
hundreds of spectators who were lined up on the
sidewalk in front of Phipps Conservatory. The first
Pitt Greek to cross the finish line was Dan Faaty
of Pi Kappa Alpha and the first female was Lisa Clifford
of Delta Zeta on a course which many said was a strug-
gle.

“Two-thirds of the route was uphill,” Sigma Chi mem-
ber Greg Simunick said. “The best thing was that the
end was downhill. The course was much tougher than
last year.” ‘

The majority of the 1,300 present took part in the 2-
kilometer walk, a new addition to the race this year.

“We made the 2k walk an option for those who want
to contribute but may not be up for a 5k run,” said
Abbie Campsie, co-chairperson of the 5k Run.

The Pitt Greeks and athletes mingled afterward and
had refreshments provided by Bruegger’s Bagels, Roy
Rogers and Frito Lay. .

Beth Yard, Public Relations Spokesperson for Pa.
Special Olympics, said the time and effort the Pitt
Greeks have put forth in all of the Greek Week events
is appreciated.

“Through all of the competition, the Pitt Greeks have
not lost sight of the goal,” Yard said. .

“They are having fun, raising money and helping PA
Special Olympics.”

“Americans dream Vietnam

“The Russians dreamed Stalin

Aware that critics think that
his ideas are hazy and false,
Stone said that it is his duty to
do the things he's doing.

“Many people make fun of
me and call me Oliver Stoned
and tell me that my ideas are a
little far out,” he said. “But you
have to believe in the power of

Stone said that the govern-
ment tries to gloss over contro-
versial events in history to bury
the seriousness of it.

“That history books try and
tell students that the assassina-

the act of one bad guy — Lee

According to PPC Lecture

Non—student Rick Patterson

Questionable reporting

Last Wednesday, WTAE Channel 4 provided perhaps the worst
piece of reporting seen in recent memory.

Following the incident outside the Original Hot Dog Shop, where
two Pitt football players and an NFL player were arrested for assault-
ing several police officers, WTAE decided to do a report on the crime
situation in Oakland. It turned out to be a blatant disregard for the
public and perpetuated stereotypes about the relationship between
the homeless and crime.

After giving a brief description of the incident, anchorperson Sally
Wiggin went on to deliver an unsubstantiated discourse about how
unsafe Oakland is. Reporter Ken Rice then attempted to penetrate
the street scene in Oakland to find the real story. He talked to an

individual behind a pizza counter who gave the infallible proof that

the Oakland crime scene is worsening by stating that, “Women walk
fast around here.” After interviewing a few students Rice then turned
his focus to the dangerous homeless people who line Forbes
Avenue. Substituting a factless editorial for reporting, he implied that
the homeless present a serious safety problem for the Oakland com-
munity. .

The University’s crime reports show that the supposition that the
homeless are prone to committing crime is simply untrue.
Connecting a report on an incident involving delinquent football
players with Oakland’s homeless is incredibly irresponsible report-
ing. '

The Pitt News also recently reported that crime in Oakland is
increasing. But our reporting was based on factual evidence, not ran-
dom commentary from a few bystanders. Our advice to WTAE is, if
you don’t know what you’re talking about, stay out of it.

Family values

Most students attend college with the hope of receiving a quality edu-
cation. Howeyer, as most of us realize, the university experience is
much more than that.. More than a few of them will meet that special
somebody with whom they hope to share the rest of their life. _

Unfortunately, recent evidence shows that only a few will end up real-
izing what has now become a storybook lifestyle — growing old togeth-
er. I
Today, in the United States, 50 percent of all marriages end in divorce.
For the children of these families the results seem to be devastating.

A recent article in The Atlantic, written by Barbara Defoe Whitehead,
disturbingly confirms the suspected: children from broken families are
six times more likely to be poor; middle class children of broken families
are two to three times more likely to drop out of school. Further
research conducted by Princeton sociologist Sara Mclanahan shows that
children from divorced homes are more likely to get pregnant early and
be out of work more often.

Such figures do not bode well for the future of this country. The ques-
tion is, what can be done to halt this downward spiral and keep our
families intact?

Unquestionably, as more and more evidence comes out, the govem—
ment will try to tackle this problem. Empirical evidence has shown us
that almost every time government tries to get involved with the family
all it does it create another bureaucratic organimtion and fail.

just as Clinton is looking to the market to help refomi welfare, so must
the government to keep families intact. Tax credits and lower interest
rates for married couples (since married couples default on loans less
often than single parents) are a good start toward keeping families
together.

But problems like this cannot be handled by the government. College
students must realize the implications of single parenthood. With chil-
dren comes responsibility, and what may be right for you may not be in
the best interests of your kids. It was The Economist who put it best 
when couples are boring rather than torturing each other, a bit more
boredom may be better than splitting up.”

The “American Dream” revealed

pring Break 1993 is finally

over. Within one week a

deer ran into my car, I
ended a relationship with my
girlfriend of one year and was
snowed in my house the last
two days of break. The good
news is.that all of the wounds
that my family incurred during
our all-out brawl on the sec-
ond day of captivity should
heal completely. With all of
this time on my hands and
refusing to do any academic
work, I started to formulate a
plan for success. All the bugs
are not worked out yet, but as
soon as I get God’s final
approval, it’s a go.

I enjoyed being locked up
in my house for two days, so I
thought, “How can I work this
to my advantage?” First of all, I
need some company. After all,
God has angels to keep him
company. I could start.by
choosing, say, attractive
females. Preferably between
the mature ages of 12 and 14.
What 12-year-old could resist
a charming prophet like
myself? If the parents are
“dedicated,” I can have the
mothers, too.

Now that the companion-
ship is taken care of, finances
are next. The most efficient
way would be to woo older
women near death who have
lots of money. This way, rev-
enue would be great while
production would be mini-
mized (good thing I took
Economics 0010). I will proba-
bly be required to provide a

service, so maybe I will let
them all live with me!

So far I have companionship
and income, but what about
protection from satanic gov-
ernmental agencies? The devil
packs automatic weapons
and, as God’s warrior, I must
protect myself. A good start
may be a stockpile of shot-
guns, then a 50—caliber

machine gun and maybe‘

even a rocket or two. This

is America, I can have as

much firepower as I want. I’ll
bet God never needed a per-
mit.

I still need an incentive to
keep my followers in the
house. It seems that one really
does not have to understand
or make sense about anything.

Tim
Desmond

As long as you are a good
speaker you can get anything
you want. The Bible has been
overused, I am going to use
The Wee/ely World News. What
better way to manipulate fee-
ble minds than to appeal to
their “intellect.” I
Some minor glitches, such
as my police record, should
not reallybe a problem. Prior
convictions and accusations
do not really concern the
authorities. However, I will
take care of those old parking
tickets. Uncle Sam says,
“Stockpile what you wish,

marry little girls and shoot at
your frierids but never forget
to pay parking violations
because ‘you’ll face the all-
powerful boot!”

A final concern for my new
plan for success is actually a
choice between three possibil-
ities: ABC, NBC or CBS. There
are only so many people to
collect donations from. I really
should think about long-term
financial security, because

_ royalties can last a lifetime. I
am starting to understand how _

David Letterman felt.
Of course you are saying,

, “Aren’t you taking advantage

of innocent people, stealing
their money, making babies
with their babies and corrupt-
ing their minds? Isn’t that
immoral, unethical and low?”
Absolutely not, I am a prophet
and that makes what I am
doing, well, heroic.

Please do not rush‘ to my
door just yet. This situation
seems oddly familiar so I fig-
ured I’d run it past the man
upstairs to get his opinion, but
it should not be a problem.
After all, this is America. We
were founded on disadvan-
taged people, corruption and
atrocity, it’s the “American
Dream.”

One last request I have for
you, the reader, is to come up
with a name for my newly cre-
ated group. Unfortunately, the
Branch Davidians has already
been taken.

nz'stforTbe Pitt News.

 

 

 
   

      

After 12-] Florz'a’a start, Part

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

After soaring to an impres-
sive 12-1 start, the Pitt base-
ball team received its first
taste of Big East play when it
traveled to Villanova for a
three—game series over
the weekend, splitting
the two games with the
Wildcats.

Villanova gave Pitt a rude
welcome in the first game of
a doubleheader on Saturday,
as Panther pitchers were
roughed up for 16 hits
and eight earned runs as
‘Nova took the opening game
9-1.

However, the Panthers
stormed back in the second
half of the twin bill, erasing
an early seven-run Wildcat
lead to pick up their first Big
East win of the season by the
final score of 13-10.

Panther rookie sensation
Matt Skokowski picked up
the win, holding the ‘Cats
scoreless for the »final 2 2/3
innings of the game, after
being brought in to stop the
bleeding of a porous Panther
staff.

With Skokowski keeping

‘the Wildcats in check, the

Panther offense finally
kicked in with five runs in
the fourth inning, followed

by three in the seventh and a
crucial addition of five more
in the eighth inning, which
won the game for Pitt.

Left fielder Kurt Allen

was one for four with two
RBIs and a pair of runs
scored.
Center fielder Al Lardo was
two for four with a pair of
ribbies and three runs scored
while first baseman Josh Roth
was also two for four in the
win, with two RBIs and a run
scored.

The biggest day, however,
was had by catcher Ed Walsh,
who recorded a two-for-four
day with four big RBIs to
help sink the Wildcats.

In the first of the two
games, Villanova received a
four-for-four, three RBI
performance from third base-
man Jack Stanczak and got
two hits each from center
fielder Dan Marinello
and first baseman Steve
Young.

Joseph Womelsdorf
notched two hits in as many
at-bats while driving in a run
to drive in Pitt’s only run.
Gonzalez was two for three
for Pitt.

Pitcher Tommy Herr picked
up the win for ‘Nova, allow-
ing only one unearned run in
seven innings, striking out
four.

Men's tennis lethargic at home

By Tom Schneider

_ Staff Writer

With a little less than a month to go before
sunny Florida and the Big East
Championships, the Pitt men’s tennis team is
trying to work itself into a groove.

The team carried a 5-2 overall record into
the Cost Center this weekend, when it split
back-to-back home matches against Robert
Morris College and the University of Buffalo.

The Panthers appeared lethargic on
Saturday as they barely squeaked by a weak
Robert Morris team by the final score of 5-4.
The biggest surprise of the day was in Pitt’s
top two singles spots, where top-seeded Scott
Smith and second seeded Alex Cobbold were
shot down.

Robert Morris’ number-one singles player,
Marc Kepple, surprised Smith and the
Panthers as he took three sets (6-4, 4-6, 6-4)
to defeat Pitt’s top dog.

“That team blew,” Smith said. “I never
should have lost that match. It was a total
freak of nature that those guys even got close

Mark Wallace gave the Colonials a 2-0
match lead when he shocked Pitt’s Alex
Cobbold in number-two singles with a straight
set (7-6, 6-3) victory.

“That was probably the worst match I have
ever played,” Cobbold said. “In 10 years of
playing tennis, I’ve never had a worse perfor-
mance.”

Cobbold reiterated Smith’s interpretation of

Women's tennis routs Buffalo

By Tom Schneider
and Chrissy Koch
T be Pitt News

The women’s tennis team came out of
hibernation this week to oil its rusty game
after a long winter break. It began its spring
season with a 9-0 spanking of the University
of Buffalo. -

The Panthers schooled Buffalo in every
aspect of the game. Senior top singles player
Julie LoPrinzi once again blew away another

Patricola in straight sets (6-1, 6-3).

“I felt a little out of shape, but everything
turned out all right,” LoPrinzi said. ‘‘I’m
happy with the way the season has gone.”

The Panthers did not lose a single set to

Buffalo — each match was a demonstration of
dominance. '

In number-two singles, first-year player
Alison Baker took out Buffalo’s Tonya
McCeary in straight sets (6-2, 6-2).

Panther Marla Zielinski blasted her number-
three singles opponent, Amy Kelly, by the
same score of 6-2, 6-2.

Pitt’s Barb McCarthy had comparatively lit-
tle trouble with her number-four singles vic-
tim, Tara Berman, beating her in straight sets

Panther workhorse Josie Neiswenter contin-
ued to impress as she disposed of her oppo-

loses two of tb ree games

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s lacrosse team, hampered by a lack of
consistency, dropped two of three games over this past
weekend at the hands of the Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club
and West Virginia University.

The Panthers, (6-3), did however manage a league
win Friday night at Pitt Stadium against Lock Haven
University, 18-2, to run their National Collegiate
Lacrosse League record to 2-0.

On Thursday night, PLC paid the Panthers a visit,
blowing open a close first half en route to a 14-10 victo-
ry. The home loss for Pitt was its first in almost three
seasons. V

In the game’s first quarter, Pitt looked as if it was
doing the blowing out. Goals by Brett Mulligan, Craig
Leslie and Josh Gochnauer gave the Panthers a quick 3-
0 lead just seven minutes into the game. PLC answered
the barrage with a goal, but Ed Croot scored just one
minute later, giving Pitt a comfortable 4-1 advantage.

But, as it would do all game, PLC’s offense got
cranked up, scoring three of the next four goals to knot
the score at four a piece at the end of the first quarter.

_ Leslie opened up the second quarter with a goal at the
2:30 mark, but again, PLC returned the favor, scoring
the next two to take a 6-5 lead. With time running out in
the second quarter, Pitt’s Gochnauer brought the
Panthers even, knotting the game at 6-6 just before the
half, a tie that the Panthers were fortunate to have.

The action in the first half for Pitt was remarkably
sloppy and inconsistent. Offensively, the Panthers
looked more like house cats, lacking the organization
and ferocity that have been trademarks for this ordinari-

HalZ—of—Famer Harris brmgspro cycling team to Pittsburgh

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

Franco Harris is best known for the
“Immaculate Reception,” the miracle
catch he made in the 1972 playoffs to
beat the Oakland Raiders and
advance to the AFC finals.

Now, Harris is attempting another
miracle, an “Immaculate Conception”
of sorts. Harris is the owner of the
Pittsburgh Power, one of 11 teams
that make up the National Cycle
League, and hopes to make the sport

of professional bicycling popular in
Pittsburgh and around the world.

The League, founded five years ago
by Peter O’Neil of New York, has a
view of making bicycling a major
sport in the United States as it is in
other parts of the world. In most of
Europe and parts of South America,
bicycling is second only to soccer as a
popular sport.

Even though bicycling is not con-
sidered a major sport in America yet,
it is a major pastime. According to the
Bicycling Institute of America, total

U.S. bicyclers number over 93 million.
Pittsburgh, which has been in the
league for three years, is one of three
teams in the Atlantic Conference
along with New York and Miami. The
Pacific conference is made up of Los
Angeles, San Diego, Tulsa, Houston
and Portland. Just this season, a
EuroConference was added, made up
of London, Amsterdam and Milan.
Harris said he enjoyed playing foot-
ball a great deal and was still interest-
ed in sports but never had any aspira-
tions of moving into coaching and

ownership of an NFL team was finan-
cially out of the question. He now
owns a bakery as well as owning the
Power.

“If you would have told me five
years ago I would have been selling
donuts for a living, I would have said,
‘You’re crazy!”’ Harris said.

The Power has given Harris a
chance to own a professional sports
team without the need to have mil-
lions of dollars lying around.

“I've never been a serious bicycler,

Indians’ boat tragedy chills baseball ’s Spring

All too often we would like to
think that the sports we cherish so
much and the talented athletes we
adore are in some way immune to
the violent nature of life in general.

But every so often, suddenly and
without warning, the microcosm of
American sports is intruded upon by
life’s cold, harsh realities.

Such was the case earlier this
week when two members of the
Cleveland Indians’ Major League

.baseball team were killed and anoth-
er was injured in a speedboat acci-
dent.

On Monday evening, a boat carry-
ing Indians relievers Steve Olin and
Tim Crews and starter Bob Ojeda
crashed into a dock not far from
their spring training site in
Tidewater, Fla.

Relief ace Olin was killed instantly
and Crews died later while undergo-
ing surgery at South Lake Memorial
Hospital. Ojeda suffered less serious
injuries and is expected to make a
full recovery.

This was the first time that two
baseball players were killed in the
same accident, and it was the first
fatality in the baseball world since
New York Yankees catcher and for-
mer Indian Thurman Munson died in
a plane crash in 1979.

As one would expect, the deaths
of Olin and Crews have had a
tremendous effect on the baseball

community.

From moments of silence before
every spring training game to
Indians Manager Mike Hargrove’s
display of emotion during a press
conference following the tragedy —
everyone and everything in baseball
has been turned upside down.

But perhaps the coldest reality of
this whole situation is that some-
times our feelings of grief for the
loss of two human beings is over-
shadowed by our concern for the
status of the team.

the American mentality.

For many people in this town and
around the country, sports is their
life’s blood. And when something
tragic happens to an athlete, most
discussion centers on the situation
his team will be facing.

It makes no difference if the per-
son is a new addition to the team,
like Crews, or a popular player and
fan favorite, like Olin. The welfare
of the team is always the primary
consideration in the mind of the die-

hard sports fan.

That’s pretty cold-
blooded, but it's true.
I noticed this reali-
ty myself on Tuesday
morning. Wherever I
went, and whomever

Tom
Schnieder

Not even a
player like Mario
Lemieux, who is as
important to the
Pittsburgh commu-
nity as he is to the

I talked to, the dis-
cussion was mainly about the
Indians’ bad luck rather than the
unfortunate, senseless deaths of Olin
and Crews.

“Typical Cleveland luck,” one per-
son said. “Just when it looks like
they’re gonna have a good year,
look what happens.”

“\Who’s gonna be their closer now,
with Olin gone?” said another.

Not one person I spoke to seemed
concerned about the pain that the
families of the victims must be going
through, but were only concerned
about what the immediate impact
will be on the team. But then, that's

sport of hockey, is
immune to this sort of judgment.

Lemieux is in the height of his
career, and when a player of
Lemieux’s stature goes down, there
is just as much concern about what
the Penguins will do without their
superstar as there is about Lemieux’s
health and well-being.

Think back to two months ago,
when shows on every TV station in
the Pittsburgh area were interrupted
and the announcement was made
that Mario Lemieux had been diag-
nosed with Hodgkin’s disease.

Of course, everyone who saw the
announcement immediately saw

their jaws drop to the floor and their
eyes bulge out as they waited to
hear the fate of the most idolized
member of the Pittsburgh communi-
ty.

But, what exactly was going
through their heads when the news
came forth? Was it something like
“Oh God, please let Mario live
through this?”

Chances are it was more like, “Oh
God, what are the Pens gonna do
now?”

The fact is that professional sports,
like any other institution in today’s
society, is a business. It’s just as
much a business as any other in the
nauon.

If a partner in a law firm should
die suddenly, a large concern at his
workplace would be who would
take over his cases. If a writer for a
major newspaper should happen to
pass away, one of the primary con-
cerns would be who is going to take
care of his beats.

And like it or not, the business
aspect of any sports-related tragedy
also immediately comes into play.

It’s a cruel injustice that our values
as members of a civilized society
have decayed to the point that we
are more concerned with how our
favorite team is going to cope with
the loss of a key member than we
are with the status of the athlete’s

_ In the third quarter, things
got even worse. PLC’s
offense exploded for seven
of the game’s next nine
goals, including a run of six
straight, to take a 13-8 lead
into the game’s final quarter.

Pitt’s Mulligan drew the
Panthers to within four, at
13-9, but each team could
only manage one goal apiece
down the stretch, leaving Pitt
on the short end of a very
long stick.

“We have not played well
all year,” head coach Gary
Neft said.

“We threw the ball away to
many times and against a
team as talented as PLC, that
will kill you.”

Friday night, the Panthers
looked to rebound as they
hosted Lock Haven, a team
they had never faced before.
This one was decided early,
however, and fortunately
for the Panthers, in their

favor.

At the start of the game, the
Panther offense looked as if
it was still reeling from the
defeat the night before.

Pitt missed opportunities
and allowed an obviously
inferior Lock Haven squad to
hang in the game.

At the 7:00 mark,
Gochnauer found himself at
the right place at the right
time when he picked up a
rebound in front of the net
and put it behind LHU goalie
Nick Luciana, giving the
home team a 1-0 lead.

That margin quickly
increased on goals by
Mulligan (2), Leslie, Brian
Barrett and Dave Walters,
and after only 15 minutes of
play, Pitt held a comfortable
6-0 lead. Pitt also scored the
lone goal in the second, leav-
ing the Panthers out front
and ' in control midway
through this contest.

Even with the game already
in hand, the Pitt offense con-

THE TRUTH GOES BONG!

Did you ever notice how the Truth goes BONG
and a lie goes PLINK? One of those old true silver
coins goes BONG when dropped, but a slug goes
PLINK! Phonies are easily detected. It's true with
metal; it’ 5 true with people, too. Abe Lincoln, Dr.
Albert Schweitzer, and Mother Teresa go BONG!
Hitler and the Ayatollah Khomeini go PLINK!

Now look at Christianity. There are millions of
people who claim to be Christian, but some are
counterfeits. How can you tell the difference? Well,
listen with your head and your heart for the truth. It
will ring true; it will strike a chord. When Jesus spoke
to the people of his day his words went

BONG!
BONG!
BONG!

He was no phony. Lives were changed. People
were encouraged because he was the Truth. The
results of his teaching had lasting effects. In fact, today
his light issues forth. His truth is still spoken, but you
must listen to those who profess a personal belief in
him and judge for yourself.

So give us a listen. We think you'll hear BONG!
Remember only valuable things are worth copying.
You never see counterfeit brown paper bags. You do
see counterfeit diamonds. Test all things and hold to
that which is true. Truth will always go BONG! Jesus
is the same yesterday, today and forever. He still goes

BONG!
BONG!
BONG!

tinued its assault on the Lock
Haven defense. Barrett
notched his second of the
game just 55 seconds into the
new half.

Minutes later, Leslie also
tallied one of his own,
putting Pitt ahead 9-0. Down
the stretch, the Panthers got
scoring from Tim Kaiser,
Mulligan, Gochnauer, Jeff
Shaner and Croot (2) to close
out the scoring and the game,
18-2.

The Panther defense played
exceptionally well, limiting
Lock Haven to just nine shots
on goal for the game and
only three in the second half,
while Pitt’s offense racked up
an incredible 49 shots.

Goalie Mike Shiner held
down Pitt’s last line of
defense, shutting out the
LHU offense for the first half
of the game. Back—up John
Foris finished the game in net
for the Panthers.

“This was a good game for
us,” Neft said. “We worked

together on both sides of the
field. Our team has realized
that we are not invincible,
but this game gave us some
confidence.”

Any confidence the
Panthers took away from this
game, however, was quickly
stripped away from them.

Saturday, Pitt traveled
down to Morgantown, W.Va.,
for a contest against the
Mountaineers in their own
version of the backyard
brawl.

In years past, the Panthers
have dominated this series,
but this time, West Virginia
sent them back to the Steel
City with their tails between
their legs, earning a 12-7 Vic-
tory that dropped Pitt’s
record to 6-3.

“We dominated the game,
but couldn’t put them all in
the net,T’ Neft said. “Our
offense just did not show up
and we gave up some things
on defense. It was just one of
those games.”

Although they played well,

As the game wore on,
though, those players wore

family and how it is dealing
with the loss of a family
member. -

Perhaps the lone exception
to how we View the death of
an athlete was in the case of
former Pittsburgh Pirate out-
fielder Roberto Clemente
who died in a plane crash
during the 1972 offseason.

Clemente played his entire
baseball career in Pittsburgh
and was nearing the end of
an illustrious career at the .
time of his death. By this
time, he was thought of
more as a pillar of the com-
munity -—- an important
friend to the people of
Pittsburgh — than he was as
a member of a major league
baseball team.

When he died, the whole
town died with him. But
their grief was more because
of the loss of a wonderful
human being rather than a
fantastic baseball player.
Everyone, of course, remi-
nisced on how great a player
he was, but his death struck
everyone on a more personal
level.

This is the way that the
death of anyone should be
looked at, and not just leg-
endary athletes whose
careers are over or are past
their prime.

Whichever way we look at
it, however, Steve Olin and
Tim Crews are dead and
nothing can bring them
back.

And though this horrible
tragedy will have no long-
term effects on the business
of baseball and its market-
place, I would not want to
be the one to tell that to the
wife and three children that
each man leaves behind.

Fortunately for Pitt, several

“The Power and the NCL has
given me a chance to follow
one of my dreams. This has
been everything I could ask
and more for me.”

Harris said that he sees a
bright future in professional
bicycling.

“Our goal by the year 2010

The Panthers finally started
to wake up in number-two
doubles, where the duo of
Smith and Kevin
Samburchino pounded Robert
Morris’ Wallace and Alex Hills
in straight sets (6-3, 6-1).

Pitt’s Campbell and Effrum
Garnett left no room for
doubt in the deciding match
of the contest as they annihi-
lated the Colonial tandem of
Jason Gray and Greg Peluso
in straight sets (6-0, 6-0).

“I think the lack of practice
during the week led to our
bad play,” Cobbold said.

“The doubles matches real-
ly came through for us in the
end,” Smith added.

The Panthers still looked
groggy On Sunday, as they
dropped a 7-2 decision to the
University of Buffalo.

Smith and Cobbold were
again the big surprise, as they
each lost their matches in sin-
gles competition.

After dropping the first set
six games to one to BuffalO’s
Kevin Humphrey, Smith came
back to take the second set
seven games to six.

He would eventually lose
the third set six games to four
after suffering an ankle injury
early in the final set.

“In the first set, that guy
[Humphrey] played out of his
ing mind,” Smith said.

“I twisted my ankle in the
third set, so I was obviously
sidetracked by that, having to
play with constant pain  I
still managed to come close
before lOsing.”

The only bright spot was
again in the final two matches
Of the doubles round, as the
teams Of Smith/Samburchino
and Campbell/Garnett
chalked up Pitt’s only two

O’Neil and the other owners
to make the NCL more excit-
ing tO an American crowd.

The Power is coming to
Pittsburgh for a meet on July
3, and, more importantly, the
“Super Bowl” of the NCL will
be held in Pittsburgh on the
weekend Of August 6 through
8 at Three Rivers Stadium.

“I want people to know that
just like all the other teams in
Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh
fans now have [a professional
bicycle team] to call its Own,”
Harris said.
