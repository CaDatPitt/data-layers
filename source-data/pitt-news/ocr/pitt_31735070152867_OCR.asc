According to Pitt’s Student Government Board,
the University is slow to bloom when it comes
to establishing an office to handle green ini-
tiatives.

One of three bills thatthe Board introduced
at its public meeting last night advocated for
the creation of an Office of Sustainability. Pitt
is one of the few member universities in the
Atlantic Coast Conference that does not have
an office devoted to sustainability and envi-
ronmental initiatives.

“This bill will pledge student government
support of the Oﬂice of Sustainability,” Board
President Mike Nites said.

The office would be a new University for-

mula group that would armually receive 0.35 _

percent —— approximately $9,000 —— from
the approximately $2.8 million Student Ac—
tivities Fund. According to the bill, the Pitt
Green Fund, which helps ﬁnance and support
student—nm environmental initiatives, would
receive about $5,000 of the cut. ,

The Office of Sustainability will help en-
vironmental student groups on campus col-
laborate on their green initiatives, accordingto
Environmental Chair Kacy McGill. According

Pitt students visit UPMC workers’ protest

Pitt students met with two UPMC employees during their weeklong workers’ right fast Tuesday. Mahita Gajanan |Assistant News Editor

Friday morning was the last time Mary
Hughes ate a meal.

Since then, Hughes, a transcription-
ist with imaging services at UPMC, has
fasted publicly to raise awareness of the
struggle workers who seek to union-
ize at UPMC face. Hughes and Chaney
Lewis, a patient transporter at UPMC
Presbyterian Hospital, will abstain from

eating until this Friday as a part of a

weeklong event called “Fast For Our Fu-
ture” through Make It Our UPMC, an
organization that works to unite people
to urge UPMC to unionize. '

Four Pitt members of the Pittsburgh
Student Solidarity Coalition —— an orga-
nization that helps students from univer-
sities in the area coordinate campaigns
for justice in labor and social cause —
visited Hughes and Lewis Tuesday to
discuss the impact of the fast.

“They are our neighbors,” Nick Good-
fellow, an organizer for PSSC, said. “Pitt

students have alstrong connection to
UPMC.”

Huddled in a tent outside UPMC’s
Downtown headquarters on Grant
Street, Hughes and Lewis talked with
the students and sipped water.

“I feel fine,” Hughes, 48, said.

Hughes and Lewis are part of a larger
force of non-medical employees who
have been pushing to ulnionize under the
Service Employees International Union,

to the Board, more than 500 students signed
apetition distributed by the Green Fund Advi-
sory Board, insupport of establishingan Office
of Sustainability. Isaac Freedman, coordinator
of GFAB, distributed the survey last semester
among student groups and online.

The previous Board passed asimilar reso-
lution last October advocating for the estab-
lishment of the Ofﬁce of Sustainability. The
Environmental Committee, GFAB and SGB
have been pushing for the oﬂice since 2012.

As previously reported by The Pitt News,
previous Environmental Committee Chairper-
son Mizanejohnson-Bowman said Vice Pro-
vost and Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
told the Environmental Committee in 2012
that the University would set up the office on
the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union. But

the University never established the ofﬁce.

According to the bill, Pitt administrators
would appoint one staff member to serve as
coordinator of the ofﬁce.

Additionally, the Board’s environmental
chair would work as the oﬁ'ice’s sustainability
intern. The intern would spend ten hours a
week in the Student Government Board and
Sustainability ofﬁces, with ﬁve hours in each.
The intern would receive a stipend of $165 a
month from the oiﬁce’s portion of the Student
Activity Fund. ' '”‘

Board members Mona Kazour and Abby
Zurschmit introduced the bill, which Nites,
McGill and former Board member Sarah Wm-
ston co—sponsored.

The Office of Sustainability, which has yet
to be created and given an ofﬁcial name by the
Board and Pitt administrators, would operate
within the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs.

McGill said the Board will discuss details,

such as location of the office and an ofﬁcial
name for the ofﬁce, over the summer with
Humphrey. ‘

The Board also introduced abill to raise the
currentAllocations Committeeﬁnalapproval
limit on allocation requests.

Currently, when the Allocation Committee
votes on a request under $500, the decision
reached by the Committee is ﬁnal, and the
request does not go to the Board for ﬁirther
deliberation. V

This resolution, which will be effective
with the start of the Board’s next ﬁscal year,‘
pending Humphrey’s approval, would raise
the approval limit to $1,200. ‘ A

According to Nites, the Board currently
votes on between 60 and 70 percent of all
supplemental allocations requests, which are
requests heard on aweeklybasis atthe public
meetings. ’

Nites said the resolution will no longer

make it mandatory that student groups come
to meetings to hear what the Allocations Com-
mittee has already recommended.

The current Allocation Committee ﬁnal
approval limit has not been raised since 1984,
according to the Board.

The Board also introduced athird bill that
will extend and make minor changes to the
Collegiate Readership Program.

Through the Collegiate Readership Pro-
gram, Pitt students can pick up free editions
of The New York Times and USA Today in
boxes, which are accessible with a student
ID, in Benedum Hall, the William Pitt Union,
Litchﬁeld Towers lobby and Posvar Hall. Two
additional boxes in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing and Sutherland Hall do not have swipe
systems.

Nites said the Board decided to add a

an effort that has seen contentious times
as SEIU claims UPMC partakes in unfair
labor practices and methods of intimida-
tion toward its employees.

Susan Manko, a UPMC media rela-
tions director, said SEIU organized the
protest entirely. Manko said she did not
have any additional comment on behalf
of UPMC on the fast.

Lewis, 31, said a lot of his colleagues
were struggling under current policies
and hoped UPMC executives noticed the
efforts.

“We mean business,” he said.

Goodfellow, a junior majoring in com-
munication, said the group members
wanted to support Hughes and Lewis in
their ﬁght for justice. L

The group members asked the work-
ers about their aims with the fast during
their half—hou_r visit with Hughes and
Lewis.

Julia Radomski, a senior economics
and anthropology major, asked the work:
ers what pushed them to publicly fast.

According to Hughes, the goal ofthe 

fast is to convince UPMC to allow its
workers to uniorfize. Fasting, Hughes
said, could affect people in a powerful
manner, as purposefully not eating sym-
bolizes the damage of not having enough
money for food.

“ [The protest] is more important than
other people’s comfort levels,” Hughes
said. '

She said Pittsburgh community mem-
bers could be uncomfortable with the
symbolic nature of the fast, but that the
issues at hand, especially the need for
higher wages, were important to pub-

licize.

So far, their efforts have garnered a

lot of support from the community. v

Kyndall Mason, a member of One
Pittsburgh, a community organization
that works to buildjobs and keep corpo-
rations accountable, volunteered at Fast
For Our Future. According to Mason, the
fast has drawn in a lot of visitors from
local unions, religious organizations and
UPMC.

Mason, 35, said many passers-by on
the street also stopped in the tents to
speak with the workers.

Mason and Glenn Grayson, also a
member of One Pittsburgh, manned a
tent adjacent to Hughes and Lewis’ where
they encouraged visitors to write mes-
sages to the workers in a guestbook and
collect buttons and ﬂyers.

“It’s been a community and worker-
driven fast,” said Grayson, 28. .

Members of PSSC signed the guest-
book and collected buttons before speak-
ing to Hughes and Lewis.

Alex Carter, a member of PSSC, said
it was very inspiring for him to see the
workers because he had the opportunity
to talk to them face to face.

“There’s a personal story attached
to the movement,” Carter, a sophomore
majoring in biology, said.

PSSC previously joined UPMC work-
ers March’3 in a large protest to demand
better jobs and higher wages. Mihir
Mulloth, another member of PSSC, said
partaking in the protest was his first
advocacy effort, and it took only one
event to spur his passion to show UPMC
workers support.

“We really have an interest,” Mulloth,
a sophomore majoring in neuroscience,
said. I

In recent years, the role of the federal
government in Americans’ lives has ex-
panded. This expansion has prompted
a national dialogue on the role and size
of the government in American soci-
ety. And still, despite the government’s
growing presence, little comprehensive
action has been taken on a sensitive, but
extremely important matter -—- mental
health.

Too often, mental health has been
considered taboo or of less significance
than more observable medical issues.
The time has come to be honest about
the inadequacies of our current health
system and not only talk about them,
but also directly address them.

Since 1955, the total United States
population has risen from about 165
million to 315 million. But in that time,
the number of psychiatric beds avail-

talkinational acti

PI IONS

able for inpatient care has declined
from 500,000 to 40,000. 1

Yet, roughly 11 million American
adults suffer from a severe mental ill-
ness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder or major depression. Further-
more, approximately 20 percent of chil-
dren ages 13 to 18 deal with a severe
mental disorder in a given year. And,
although veterans makeup less than
one percent of the total population,
they account for about 20 percent of
suicides each year. To combat these
harsh realities, bold action is required.

H.R. 3717, better known as the Help-
ing Families in Mental Health Crisis
Act, is legislation recently introduced
by Congressman Ti,m,Murphy, R—Pa. The
congressman is a Ifittsburgh clinical
psychologist wholreceived his‘ Ph.D.
from the University of Pittsburgh. His
bill has been praised by the National
Alliance on ’Mentali'Illness.‘Board Presi-

dent Keris Myrick as “the most compre-
hensive mental health bill we’ve seen in
a long, long time.” \

The bill addresses a lack of care for
major mental illnesses. For instance, of
the 11 million adults with severe men-
tal disorders in America, 2 million go
untreated. This hole in the system is a
detriment to all, including and most

speciﬁcally. the patient.
' Congressman Murphy’s act proposes *

funding for‘ clinics that meet scientifi-
cally supported standards, funding for
suicide prevention as well as increased
training for police officers and emer-
gency medical workers to help them
better identify and treat individuals

~ with mental disorders. In addition, the

act suggests thatpayments be made to
Medicaid in order to provide the under-
privileged with better mental health
services. _ I I '

' The bill also tackles theincreased

on must be taken to address mental illness

need for care and assistance at the pe-
diatric level. According to Murphy’s
website, “Signs of mental illness first
appear in a person between the ages of
14 and 25. However, there is a critical
shortage of child psychiatrists.” There-
fore, H.R. 3717 “would encourage pedia-
tricians to undergo additional training

in mental health care.”

As the legislative process transpires
around this bill, Americans should
think about the importance of action
on this topic. Too often,tragic events
stimulate reﬂection. And once that re-
ﬂection occurs, it is too late. The goal of
action should be.to prevent tragedies,
not be reminded by them, and to ‘help
the largest population of those afflicted
possible. In order to achieve progress,
we must act proactively, not reactively.
Mental illness and the state of mental

health care in this country cannot be
put aside. Action must be taken at the
national level in order to attempt to
aid those suffering from severe mental
disorders. And if we see the passage of
H.R. 3717, we as a nation can finally take
our first real step towards bettering
mental health. I

No. 8 Florida
State poses
tough test

Caitlin Hinsey
Stq/ff W'rz'ter

Pitt’s softball team might give validity
to the saying “things get worse before
they get better.”

After losing ﬁve straight games, the
Panthers will face one of their toughest
opponents of the season when the No. 8
Florida State Seminoles roll into Vartabe-
dian Field for a conference doubleheader
today. The ﬁrst game is scheduled for 2
p.m., with the following contest slated
for a 4 p.m. start.

The Panthers, though, are not afraid.

“We are going to come out ﬁring on
all cylinders like we have been trying to
do with every one of our opponents,”
redshirt sophomore second baseman
Maggie Sevilla said. “At the end of the
day, the ranking doesn’t matter because
the team who decides to perform the
best will win.”

Pitt needs a win not only to ﬁx their
current slump, but to gain some points
in the ﬁght to make the ACC tournament.

Going into today’s games, the Pan-
thers (13-22, 4-12 ACC) will have played
eight conference games in a row. During
this eight game stretch, though, Pitt has
picked up only one win, a 2-0 victory
against Boston College on April 6. Pitt
lost that three-game weekend series
and was swept by Virginia Tech later in
a midweek doubleheader. The Panthers
also fell this past weekend when Syra-
cuse swept them in a three-game series
at home.

Junior outﬁelder Carly Thea has a sim-
ple explanation to remedy the struggles.
“We need to come together as a team,
which we will, to get ourselves in a posi-
tion to win,” she said.

Though Florida State is one of the
country’s premier teams, the Seminoles
are also looking to bounce back after a
rough week.

Kevin VVheeler
For The Pitt News

The last time Pitt’s baseball team picked up
a road victory, Major League Baseball teams
were still toiling in Spring Training, Pitt stu-
dents weren’t completely frantic about ﬁnals
and “3oo: Rise of an Empire” was number
one at the box office.

at Presbyterian on March 12, but the Pan-
thers’ struggles aren’t limited to road games.
The team has dropped eight of its last nine
games, with a ﬁve-game losing streak.
After Tuesday’s scheduled game against
Youngstown State was cancelled because
of inclement weather, the Panthers will hit
the road today for a nonconference matchup
with Kent State (22-12, 9-3 MAC) at Olga

Pitt is coming off a sweep last weekend
at the hands of the now No. 17 Miami Hurri-
canes, dropping their overall record to three

Going on the road has been the biggest
struggle for the Panthers, who have lost 12
of their 18 games away from Charles L. Cost
Field this season.

Pitt coachjoejordano remains optimistic
that the team can escape its recent funk.

“I am not sure of why we are struggling on .

said. “We have not played well on the road

but I am conﬁdent we can turn it around. '

that staying loose during the game is impor-
tant to [help] the younger guys not press,”
Vranka said. _ ‘

Although the Panthers have been coming
up short recently, the team does notseem
to lack conﬁdence according to sophomore
inﬁelder Dylan Wolsonovich.

“We all believe that we can compete
against any team in the country when we
play our game,” Wolsonovich said.

When asked what the Panthers need to do
against Kent State in order to end the current
losing streak, Jordano offered his remedy.

“I am trying to simplify the process as
much as possible. We need to execute the
little things,” he said. “This team has played
fairly consistently all year. If you analyze our
losses, regardless of opponent, they have all
been competitive games.”

Pitt has been competitive during its re-
cent skid, with only three of its eight losses
this month coming by more than three runs.
Perhaps this is a sign that Jordano’ and his

Florida State (39-6, 16-3 ACC) had
its 17-game win streak snapped this past
Wednesday when it faced in-state rival
No. 2 Florida at home in Tallahassee, Fla.
Over the weekend, the Seminoles started
a series against No. 25 Notre Dame in
which the Fighting Irish rallied from
behind in the bottom of the sixth to win

game one 8-5. The Seminoles stole game ‘

two by plating four runs in the ﬁnal three
innings to beat Notre Dame 9-7.
Overall, Florida State has been a

_ strong team. The Seminoles were voted

as preseason favorite, and currently are
at the top of the ACC leaderboard for

1 points and in individual categories.

Redshirt junior shortstop Maddie
O’Brien, a two -time ACC All-Tournament
team member, has been a star by leading
the conference with a .448 batting aver-
age. Of her 60 hits, O’Brien has mashed
18 home runs and collected 67 RBI.

Junior pitcher Savannah King said she
doesn’t allow herself to become over-
whelmed with the opponent, partly be-
cause of her approach and partly because
of her performance on Feb. 9 ‘against

then No. 2 Oklahoma.

“I approach each hitter pitch by pitch.
I cannot allow myself to get overwhelmed
[because we] faced the reigning NCAA
champions and lost a one-hit game,”
King said of Pitt’s 2-1 loss, which Okla-
homa won with its only hit being a two-
run home run.

Preseason first-team ACC pitcher
Lacey Waldrop is also having a stellar
season. The right-handed junior has 26
wins —— more than the Panthers have as
a team — and an ERA of 0.87. Waldrop
also has struck out 210 batters.

Sevilla, who has nine home runs and
leads the Panthers in extra base hits, will
face Waldrop with a focused mentality
at the plate. '

“The keys are to control what we can
control individually and as a team,” Se-
villa said. “Keeping our focus on the pitch
and play at hand will be essential to our
success.’’ , . 4

Pitt will look to Sevilla and a scorch-
ing veteran hitter in Thea, who is bat-
ting a team-high .383  more than 100
points higher than her closest teammate
—— to lead the team. Thea said she has

high hopes that Pitt will come away vic- -

torious tomorrow.
“The key points for our success is

playing together, keeping our bats and
defense going and backing-up our pitch-
ers by being aggressive at the plate and
fielding clean for easy outs, while coming
up with the big plays and big hits when we
need a change of pace,” she said.

Even if it seems like the Panthers are
in for a real challenge today, Thea rests
assured that she can see the light at the
end of the tunnel for the team.

“We just need to continue to move
forward, learning from our mistakes and
continuing with the good we have been
doing,” she said. “Keeping our heads high
even when things aren’t going the way
we want because if we can do that, we
will succeed.” I

players are taking the recent struggles seri-
ously and are close to getting themselves out
of their slump. Or perhaps it’s evidence that
the team simply struggles to come through
when they need to.

Either way, Wolsonovich cited a few
things the Panthers need to do to get back

to winning, including capitalizing on op-
portunities with runners in scoring position
and playing clean defense.

“We have to play ﬂawless baseball, which
we know we are capable of,” he said. “So it
really just comes down to execution for us.”

The starting pitchers for both teams on
Wednesday are yet to be determined, but
Pitt will likely put the 6-foot—7 freshman T.].
Zeuch or junior Luke Curtis on the mound.
Zeuch has been consistent for the Panthers
in his six starts this season, pitching to a
1-2 record and a 2.36 earned run average.
Curtis, meanwhile, has only started once
this year, but in 10 relief appearances, he has
accumulated a 2.08 earned run average and
18 strikeouts in only 17 1/3 innings pitched.

Either pitcherwill have his hands ﬁill with
Kent State’s offense, which includes ﬁve hit-
ters with a batting average of .300 or better.

The hottest hitter of the bunch has been
inﬁelder Zarley Zalewski, who is currently
batting at a .409 clip and has knocked in 24
runs. Another dangerous offensive player
in the Kent State lineup is Alex Mildos, a
junior outﬁelder hitting with a .391 batting
average and three home runs to pair with
29 runs batted. I
