Meese’s

No. 2 man

resigns due
‘to scandal

By Pete Yost

Associated Press Writer

VVASHlN(}T()N (AP) -- In a
move that reportedly shocked At-
torney (ieneral Edwin Meese Ill,
the lustice Department's No. 2
official and the head of the
department’s criminal division
abruptly resigned Tuesday amid
a nearly year-old criminal inves-
tigation of Meese.

Deputy Attorney General Ar-
nold Burns said in a letter to
President Reagan, ”Unfortunate-
ly, I have regretfully concluded
that I must return to private life
this time." He did not
elaborate.

William Weld, who as an assis-
tant attorney general oversees all
federal criminal investigations,
resigned effective at the close of
the business day Tuesday, despite
a personal plea from other depart-
ment officials that he remain on
for several weeks.

Two of Burns’ aides and two of
Weld's aides also quit simul-
taneously.

CBS News reported, mean-
while, that subpoenas had been
issued in the investigation of
Meese in regard to a new area of
pcissihlc‘ illegality. The television
network said investigators for in-
dependent counsel lames McKay
are trying to determine whether
long-time Meese friend E. Robert
Wallach had used improper in-

0 fly a kite

fluence to help Meese's wife get
a job with the Multiple Sclerosis
Society in Washington.

Another tc)p Justice Department
official, Solicitor General Charles
Fried, said that the resignations
were leading him to reconsider
his future at the Justice
Department.

Despite the departure of the
top aides, Meese said Tuesday
night he has no plans to resign.
”No,” he responded to reporters
who asked him whether he was
about to step down.

After receiving a standing ova-
tion from his staff at a final meet-
ing Tuesclay afternoon, Weld told
his aides that the continuing in-
vestigation involving the attorney
general and ”Wallach” was cast-
ing a ”cloud” that was having a
negative impact on the Justice
Department, according to depart-
ment sources who spoke on con-
dition of anonymity.

Cathy Carr spent yesterday afternoon on Flagstaff Hill enjoying the simpler aspects
of pilotless aviation — kite flying.

Amnesty group seeks certification

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

A chapter of Amnesty Interna-
tional, a human rights group, is
currc-ntly being organized at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Mary Tidlow, a Pitt student ”in-
strumental in founding Amnesty's
Pitt chapter,” said that the goals
of the group directly correlate
with those of Amnesty Interna-
tional U.S.A., based in Washing-
ton, D.C.

Amnesty International U.S.A. is
a non-violent, non-political or-
ganization which al‘)ides by and
wishes to enforce the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,
which was accepted by the Unit-
ed Nations on December it),
1948, acc:ording to Susan Coke,

an Amnesty International
spolcesperson.

The declaration prc)ltil)its any
country to hold a person prisoner
unjustly due to conscience. This
condition would include cruel
and unusual punishment for any-
one due to their ethnic back-
ground or personal ideologies,
providing that person never used
violence. The dec laration also in-
cludes the death penalty as being
cruel and unusual punishment,
according to Coke.

”[Amnesty] works toward the
unconditional release of
prisoners of conscience," she
said, ”but we do not use
violence."

Coke explained that Amnesty
tries to enforce the declaration
mostly through initiating letter-

writing campaigns. Tliese carn-
paign-. direct Amnesty's i(i(),()()()
inernliers in the United States to
write l(‘ilt‘i's asking govclrriinerits
that violate the human rights
dec laration to rec c)ttsl(l(‘t their ac-
tions. (‘oke said that doing this
applies t)F(‘\Hlll'(‘ to that country
and alerts other nations to the
probleni at hancl_

"VVO never take full responsi-
bility for stopping an execution,"
said (Toke. She explained that
President Reagan, Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and Amnesty
all had a hand in postponing the
execution of the Sharpville Six, a
South African group scheduled to
be put to death by their govern-
ment because of their political
ideologies.

The sp(‘.tl\t*rs will foc Us on c on-
temporary social issues ranging
frc)m South African apartheid to
the revolution in Nicaragua.

Conference coordinator, luliett
Montaulc said, “the (()Hl(’l't‘Ht(’
will give people an opportunity
to learn more about socialism
and the things that young people
are facing today."

The conference calls on people
to defend their rights.

“[The people] will always have
to defend democratic rights,”
Montauk said, "as long as the
present system exists that sttt)—
ports racism and unemplownent
and candidates support the it(‘t’(l\
of big business and not the
people.

”The lran-(‘ontra scandal lids
made us aware that dec isions are
not made by Congress," sairl
Montauk. "They are made by the
people who own the country
the Roc ketellers, the (,}ir‘iiegies,
the Mellons,"

”\Nc>want a peaceful change,"
continued Montauk, "but when
you stand up for your rights, vio-
lenc e will always c onie from the
other side. The civil rights move-
ment organi/ed clemonstrations
peacefully, but always found
violence."

Montaulc said that the differ-
ent ct l)c*twc*c*n the Young Socialist
Alliance and other socialist or-
gani/ations is found in their in-
tc*rprc*tations of Marx.

"VVc> feel that the best exariiple
of soc ialisin is in (‘uba and
Nicaragua," Montauk said. "The
Soviet Union made good ad-
V.tt1(,(‘s in l‘)l7, but now a
bureaucrat y exists that does not
serve the interests of the people."

Pitt student Angie Hirsh, a
r'iiember of the alliance, believes
the conference will be worth-
while and will offer an opportu-
nity for students to organize into
political organizations.

”The conference is an example
of student activism,” said Hirsch.
’’It is an example of students con-
cerned [with] wanting to change

things and make them better.”

WASHINGTON — The Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
recommended overwhelmingly
Wednesday that the Senate rati-
fy a historic treaty to eliminate all
U.S. and Soviet medium-range
nuclear weapons.

”This is a small step away from
the nuclear brink,” said Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Ca|if., following the
committee's 17-2 vote.

”It means the elevator of
nuclear escalation will finally
stop and hopefully descend,”
said committee chairman
Claiborne Pell, D-R.l.

Cranston said his head count
shows no more than five senators
will vote against the Intermediate-
range Nuclear Forces Treaty
when the full Senate takes up the
treaty, probably late next month.
Ratification requires a two-thirds
Senate majority, 67 votes if all
I00 senators are present and
voting.

worked vigorously to derail the
treaty.

NEWS BRIEFS

ASSOCIATED PRESS
T

The resounding committee
vote papered over a bitter parti-
san dispute over an amendment
added to the treaty on Tuesday
with the aim of assuring that the
meaning of the pact cannot be
reinterpreted by a future presi-
dent without the consent of
Congress.

Many moderate Republicans
said the amendment represented
a partisan jab at President Reagan
and his administration's rein-
terpretation of the 1972 Anti-

Ballistic Missile Treaty to permit
the deployment of a Star Wars
missile defense system.

Several GOP lawmakers said
the controversy may cause them
to reassess their support of the
treaty, and Cranston said he may
be willing to search for a com-
promise when the Senate debates
the issue.

Police raid ring of
tainted meat sellers

SCRANTON, Pa. — Three fed-
eral meat inspectors and eight
other people were arrested Wed-
nesday for allegedly participating
in a ring that sold unsafe and
uninspected meat.

The U.S. Department of
Agriculture, assisted by the state
attorney general’s office and state
police, raided five northeastern
Pennsylvania meat plants at 6
a.m. Wednesday.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March 3l, 1988

According to a USDA spokes-
man, some meat was stamped as
inspected even though it was not.

The USDA identified those ar-
rested as William Stewart, own-

Dennis Stewart, manager of the
plant; Vincent Scavazzo, owner
of the Dotti Lou Meat Co. in

Meese should step
down — immediately

Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd has called for Attorney
General Meese to resign. Meese, when asked about his reac-
tion to Byrd's statement, said that it was ”business as usual”
at the Justice Department, and that he has no intention of step-
ping down. He claims that he has done nothing to warrant his
departure. 

For a man who has done nothing, Edwin Meese’s name has
come up on far too many summons. Earlier this year, there was
a disclosure that Meese had knowledge of a possible pay-off
to an Israeli political party to ensure the success of a proposed
pipeline in Iraq. No payment was made, and the pipeline project
fell through, but Meese kept the information to himself.

After conducting an investigation of the lran—Contra affair,

Meese concluded that there had been some oversights in judge-
ment, but that no further action was warranted. Faced with the
same ”oversights,” special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh has is-
sued broad indictments for four players, gotten a guilty plea
from another and has promised more indictments.

Throughout these and other investigations into possible sleazy
dealings in the Justice Department, Meese has maintained,
remarkably, a pose of dignified indignation. When two of the
four top Justice Department officials resigned this week, Meese
had little comment. Business as usual. That kind of thing hap-
pens all the time.

There is obviously a problem in the Justice Department. There
is obviously something very wrong there. The highest law en-
forcement officer in the country has been asked by numerous
members of both houses to step down. He has gotten no real
support from either George Bush or Ronald Reagan. This time,
it appears as though Meese is on his own. He should also be
on his way out. Soon. Very, very soon.

500 to see a blue collar?

Genesis. U2. John Cougar
Mellencamp. Just a few of the big
name entertainers who have per-
formed in Pittsburgh over the past
year.

But the most awaited concert of
the year, maybe the decade, took
place less than two weeks ago -
Bruce Springsteen and the E
Street Band.

Huge lines formed less than an
hour after ticket information had
been announced, and, despite
the dreary weather that night,
hundreds of fans waited up all
night on the streets of Oakland
for the chance to buy choice seats
for the show.

A few of my friends were able
to buy front row, as well as fourth
and twelfth row seats.

But why would three people
need 12 tickets in three different
rows? To get a better view of Clar-
ence Clemons? I don't think so.

One of my friends made
$1,000 by selling his set of tick-
ets, including five hundred bucks
for a front row seat. The other two
both made over 10 times their in-
itial investment of $20 per ticket.

True Springsteen fans, you ask?
Actually, yes. They said it was the

MATT
MARTIN

best show they had ever seen.
But what made it that much bet-
ter was that their wallets were
padded.

It seems it has become almost
trendy for concertgoers to buy as
many tickets as possible and sell
them for five times the face value.

But who is the first person in
line to buy the front row, middle
stage seats and offer them at re-
sale? Why does he have the right
to deny fans good seats without
paying more than the actual price
of the ticket?

He doesn't. It doesn't matter if
it's the Jimi Hendrix — Janis
Joplin Resurrection Tour; no one
should have to pay $500 for a
seat.

Ticket scalping is not a small-
time operation. It is a widespread
problem, and one that is not easy
to deal with. The performers have
no control over what happens to
their tickets after they have been
put on sale.

Bands and arenas have done

their best to curtail scalping by
limiting tickets to four per person,
but who's to stop three people,
like my friends, from buying I2
tickets between them, keeping
three and selling the other nine?
No one.

Scalping is against the law, but
apparently’ not deemed as a
major problem. Police who
patrol the ticket lines are more
concerned with enforcing the

open container law than the ille-

gal resale of tickets.

I And it's not as if scalpers work
completely through classified ads
and posted advertisements. Scal-
pers also approach those people
first in line and pay them to buy
tickets.

So what is there to do? Not
much. Sure, prospective ticket
holders could ignore scalpers, but
they would get stuck with inferi-
or seats. And it's easy to say you
won't buy a ticket from a scalper
— until your favorite band comes
to town, that is.

But something obviously has to
be done. Paying more than face
value for a ticket, whether it's for
the Grateful Dead or the Rat Pack
Tour, is simply ridiculous.

A letter wondering about America's newest fad

The following arrived at The
Pitt News a long time ago. I've
held it for myself since then,
thinking.

WALKING BY MOONLIGHT
PAIII. ANATER

While in the U.S. military serv-
ice, I volunteered for a tour of
duty, excuse the expression, in
Vietnam. I was 20-years—old at the
time and full of curiosity and
patriotism. I received orders and
was assigned to a military police
unit at Da Nang Air base, Repub-
lic of South Vietnam. To those
who served there before me, Da
Nang came to be known as
”Rocket City.” It didn’t take long
to find out why. Within hours of
my arrival, the base came under
attack, and I was introduced to
real fear — facing the possibility
that I may not make it home in
one piece, or not going home
alive.

It has been nearly 20 years
since I came home. Fortunately,
I received no disabling wounds,

mentally or physically, but there
were wounds of a different sort.
The kind of wounds that come
from being rejected by a society
that didn’t understand what we
had gone through. The kind of
wounds that come from reading
about a fellow veteran being shot
to death in a Los Angeles airport
because he had served in Viet-
nam. The kind of wounds that
come from being labelled a
”baby-kilIer." These wounds re-
main some 20 years later, and the
irony of it all is that they were in-
flicted by the American people,
not the enemy. Why?

Now, we are faced with the
war all over again. From the suc-
cess of Oliver Stone's Platoon,
we have been offered Full Metal
Jacket, Hamburger Hill and, of

course, the cleaned-up version of
the‘ war offered by CBS, Tour of
Duty. Many of us who were there
in Vietnam are drawn to these
movies by some invisible mag-
net, and the results can be deva-
stating.

I have seen every film and most
documentaries and TV shows
about the war. Fifteen years ago,
the TV scriptwriters would have
been lost if it weren't for the Viet-
nam veteran. How many times
did we see McGarrett or Barna-
by Jones track down the ”crazed
Vietnam veteran?”

For nearly 20 years, the Viet-
nam veteran has been misunder-
stood, discriminated against, and,
as I mentioned, even killed for his
part in the war. What purpose

does it serve to drag us through
these times all over again? What
is this sudden attraction to the
Vietnam War? Very few people
were concerned with it before,
and now it seems to be in vogue
to talk to a Vietnam vet, to try to
understand what it must have
been like. I will suggest to you
that it is quite impossible to feel
the effects of napalm unless you
have been exposed to it. I will
also suggest that it is quite impos-
sible to understand the terror of
running through the jungle in
complete darkness while in the
middle of a fire-fight. It is quite
impossible, too, to understand
what goes on in the minds of pi-
lots after dropping their bombs
on cities and villages. These
things cannot be put on the sil-
ver screen or the television set.

After trying to put the war be-
hind us for so long, here it is
again —- ”the living room war,”
brought back to the living room.

Will the Americans win the war
this time around?

For whatever reason, the war is
back. Perhaps the exposure to
this sort of mayhem will keep fu-
ture generations from having to
do the same thing. If this is the
purpose, then maybe it makes
some sense. The underlying
thought here, however, is that it
has turned itself into a commer-
cial enterprise that is lining the
pockets of Hollywood producers;
if there is a resentment, the
resentment is in that.

It's appalling that in a suppos-
edly moral society, this sort of im-
morality goes on.

If there is someone out there
who can tell me why we are back
in Vietnam, I would love to heart
your answer. You see, many of us
have never left.

Today's comic books are no
longer concerned with just super-
heroes who can leap tall build-
ings in a single bound. A new
form of comics has emerged un-
der the name of the graphic
novel

Graphic novels differ from or-
dinary comic books in a number
of significant ways. Most of them
are published in trade paperbacks
rather than in ordinary comic
book form. Their stories are also
more in depth and avant garde
than conventional comic books.

Graphic novels such as Raw,
Batman: The Dark Knight Returns
by Frank Miller and Maus: A Sur-
vivors Tale have all been critical-
ly acclaimed and have brought
new respect for the strip art.

Raw is a comic book that says
it is for ”damned intellectuals.”
In a story called ”Manhattan,” a
Frenchman living in the so-
named city becomes alienated
and depressed with city life. He
wanders the streets of New York
aimlessly until he can't take it
anymore, buys a gun and shoots
himself.

Dark Knight is a new look at
the popular comic-book charac-
ter and television superhero Bat-
man. It puts Batman to the test
like never before.

Maus is the autobiographical
story of Art Spiegelmen (one of
the editors of Raw) and his father,
Vladek, a survivor of the
Holocaust. V|adek’s story is por-
trayed by representing the Jews as
mice and the Nazis as cats. Spie-
gelmen also shows how he
learned to cope with his father
and his experiences.

One of the most popular graph-
ic novelists in Europe is Hugo
Pratt. Pratt, an Italian in his 60s
who has written Corto Maltese
since the late 1960s. Corto
Maltese is quite popular in Eu-
rope and sold over 50,000 copies
in France alone.

Maltese is a cross between In-
diana Jones and Magnum PI. In
the adventure Corto Maltese in
Africa, Maltese and his compan-
ion Cush — a warrior of the Ben
Ami tribe of Ethiopia — battle the
Germans and British in World
War I.

The Silent Invasion by Michael
Cherkas and Larry Hancock was
the winner of last year's Kirby
Award -— an award given by
comic book professionals for ex-
ceHence.

The Silent Invasion by Larry
Hancock and Michael Cherkas
tells the adventure of star report-
er Matt Stinkage who discovers
that his home of Union City was
invaded by aliens who have
taken over the minds of the town-
speople. Unfortunately, nobody
believes that the invasion is real.
This all takes place in the 1950s.
Also, the comic is drawn in pen
and ink.

Hancock said the silent inva-
sion was inspired by the science
fiction movies of the 19505 and
the detective novels of the 19305.

Hancock said that they set the
comic in the '50s because he and
artist Cherkas thought that it
would be very effective in black

and Cherkas will start a new

in July.

Hancock, 33, of Toronto,
Canada, is quitting his job as an
accountant for Touche-Ross in
Toronto, so he can devote more
time to his writing.

Terry Nanitier, of Nanitier,
Beall and Minostchine — the
American publishers of the Cor-
to series and The Silent Invasion,
said that he believes the critical
success of Raw and Maus has
helped his company.

Nanitier said he got the idea for
starting a graphic novel publish-
ing company while he was living
in France where one out of 10
books sold is a graphic n()vel.
Nanitier has been negotiating
with B. Dalton Book Stores to
open a graphic novel section.

Is there any social situation
Neil Simon hasn't written about
in his career?

We've had old age in The Sun-
shine Boys, divorce in The Odd
Couple, alcoholism and
homosexuality in Only When I
Laugh and adultery in The Last of
the Red Hot Lovers.

Now we get boot camp.

God, this guy's been through a
lot.

Biloxi Blues is the newest Si-
mon play to make it to the silver
screen. The second episode of his
”formative” trilogy starts with
Brighton Beach Memoirs (filmed
in 1986) and concludes with the
yet unfilmed Broadway Bound. It
concerns the further adventures
of the quintessential ”our hero,"
Eugene Morris Jerome. Here, we
have Eugene trying to fuel his
writer's data pool by enlisting in
the Army during the last months
of World War ll.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March 31, T988

The film opens with Eugene
and new forced-militia friends
streamlining down through the
countryside of heartland U.S.A.
on a train Eugene finds no less
worthy of his intellectual psyche
than if Woody Guthrie himself
were aboard. This is quite a jour-
ney for our young man —— it is the
first time he has found himself
anywhere far from the comforts
of his Brooklyn home and ”nor-
mally domestic Brooklyn Jewish
family, complete with matzo
balls and whining.”

As this platoon of the hodg-
epodge reaches its destination of
Biloxi, Miss., Eugene, in one of
the many of the film's genuinely
funny snippets of dialogue, is
taken aback by the heat. ’’I didn't
expect it to be this hot,” he
drones. ”This is really hot. Brook-
lyn never got this hot. This is Afri-
ca hot. Tarzan couldn’t stand this
kind of heat.”

The army of doughnuts and
U.S.O. shows of Eugene’s imagi-
nation is nowhere to be found.

  
     
   

o combat the Biloxi Blues "‘

Seemingly losing a pound
through perspiration with each
step taken, Eugene begins to have
second thoughts about not being
”behind the plow” (so to speak)
anymore. But, to his satisfaction,
he has found some new buddies
in this outfit — enough, he thinks,
to provide him several anecd es
for his memoirs already in
progress.

First, there is Wykowski, a lum-
bering, brutal stoic of a soldier
who will always do what he is
told and usually does it well.
Then there is Carney, an amiable
friend who only wants to get
through. Next, Selridge, a fop for
anything popular at the moment.
In other words, the eternal yes
man. And then there is Hen-
nesey, a generally Iikeable fel-
low, but one in whom dark civil
wars always seem to be ragiiﬁr
(the reason for this makes up one
of the films many subplots).

But of all of the members of Eu-
gene's new gang, the most
difficult of all for any of them to
comprehend, but especially Eu-
gene, is Epstein. Epstein is Eu-
gene's only fellow Jewish
soulmate, but he prides himself
so on being the nonconformist

' Being is believing for this motion picture experience

By Gina Landi

Staff Writer

The Unbearable Lightness of
Being is often comic, but by no
means is it light. It is an epic,
three—hour wallow in sex, rather

sketchy ideas and politics. The
film fairly revels in its own sen-
suality, which is self-indulgent
but never boring.

An adaptation of Czech Milan
Kundera’s novel, the film is set in
1968 Prague, at the time of the

Soviet invasion. It explores three
characters and the impact (and
lack of) of the invasion on their
lives.

Briefed on Kundera by a friend,
I wasn't surprised by the surreal
quality of this film and the

characters that populate it. In
Kundera’s strange literary
universe, there are two kinds of
people —— angels and demons.
Demons delight in the chaotic
absurdity of life, and hence, are
light, free spirits. Angels are sad-

died with morality and belief in
certain ”truths”; they are heavy.

Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis), the
womanizing doctor and male
lead in the film, is of the latter
dimension. He's as likely to
seduce women in the hospital as
anywhere else. Even surgery is
play —— he saws away at a patient
while humming along to an over-
heard waltz to the dismay of his
colleagues.

Day—Lewis is a fine actor, but at
first he doesn't seem very com-
fortable as Tomas. He's a self-
styled hedonist, to be sure, but a
little too mannered to be a true
demon. His mistress, Sabina
(Lena Olin), is a lot like him. A
free—wheeling artist, her medium
of choice is shards of mirror.

Tomas’ wife, Tereza (Juliette
Binoche), however, is the angel
figure. Somewhat of an artist, she
captures reality in photography,
a total opposition to Tereza’s frag-
mented mode. Like Tomas and
Sabina, she is highly sexual, but
emotionally dependent on
Tomas.

All of the characters in the film
are portrayed with great skill,
down to the most minor.
However, I think the screenplay
is a copout. The characters get to
mouth some profound ideas —-
the camera captures their expres-
sion — and that is about all. None
of them were explored satisfac-
torily. There is no real discourse

No Age comes of age in the 
last half of this century

Various Artists
No Age
SST

SST records, the biggest of all
independent labels, periodically
releases sampler collections of
selected artists to promote their
records.

Those specially priced albums
usually contain rare or previous-
ly unavailable songs from estab-
lished acts like Husker Du and
Minutemen as well as songs from
new and unproven acts. Follow-
ing of this trend have been all
three Blasting Concept albums
and the cassette, Program Anni-
hilator.

Since SST has signed so many
instrumental artists in the last two
years, a brand new compilation
of all instrumental music has just
been released. No Age is a two
record set that sells for less than
the average album, which is im-
mediately one of two incentives
to but it. The other is that No Age,
unlike some compilations, is ac-
tually consistent: it's good all the
way through.

The music on No Age ranges
from the atmospheric improvisa-
tion of Paper Bag’s ”Faith
Opaque” to the avant—garde
modern classical workout of El-
liot Sharp's ”Diurnal”.

Each artist has a unique style

that stands on its own. Glenn
Phillips, one time guitarist for the
legendary Hampton Grease
Band, is represented by the driv-
ing ”Vista Cruiser” from his Ele-
vator album. ”Cruiser" is a

melodic venture remeniscent of’!

Jan Hammer’s ”Miami Vice
Theme” — only better. If the rest
of his album sounds as good as
this, he's got himself an under-
ground hit.

The more well known SST in-
strumentalists like Lawndale and
Gone contribute two songs as do
several other groups. This works
will to show their versatility at
playing different styles and at

“It was a catch ’22' situation. I was graduating and I had the
perfect job lined up. But in all the excitement, I forgot to think about
how I would get to work. I needed a reliable car to get to my job,
yet I needed work to afford a car. And because I was just starting
off, I had no credit history.

I was pretty depressed, until I heard about SAMSON BUICK.
They have a program that allows 4 year or graduate degree holders
the opportunity to buy or lease a NEW SAMSON BUICK six months
prior to graduation or up to one year after. My lack of credit history
wasn't even a problem, all they needed was verifiable employment
commitment.

Thanks to SAMSON BUICK, I’m driving a new car...which, by
the way, I got for a fantastic price.”

Staff Writer

With the recent release of his
eighth album, Robyn Hitchcock
has finally garnered the respect
and attention that he rightfully
deserves. Since his days as found-
ing member of the influential Brit-
tish '60s revivalist group, Soft
Boys, Hitchcock has been
producing music that is uncom-
promising and original.

”Maybe I'm forever doomed to‘

play to heads and students and
yuppies,” he told “Musician. “My
songs are not designed to please
people — although they're not
designed to alienate people.”

Hitchcock, known for his ec-
centric lyrics and catchy melo-
dies, doesn’t believe in finishing
his songs too fast. He prefers to
craft them slowly and wait until
they feel right before recording
them.

He has said that his least

favorite album is Fegmania! be-
cause the material just didn't feel
right. Although he had no materi-
al ready at the time, Slash
Records had put tremendous time
constraints on him to produce
something. In order to meet their
deadline, he quickly wrote the
songs in the studio. Even though
it’s not one of his favorite albums
as a whole, it did contain one of
his most memorable songs, "The
Man with the Lightbulb Head.”

Robyn Hitchcock's bizzare lyr-
ics are well thought out and
usually quite funny. His lyrical
imagery is reminiscent of John
Lennon's post—Rubber Soul Bea-
tles era and Dylan's Highway 61
Revisited psychedelia.

He has a couple of themes that
recur throughout his catalogue:
bulbous heads (”The Man with
the Lightbulb Head” and ”Ba|-
loon Man”) and fish (”Midnight

Fish” and ”Luminous Rose” from ~

A Globe of Frogs). His fish fetish

' Robyn Hitchcock: former Soft Boy gets hard

verged on obsessive when he
dedicated a whole song, ”Bass,"
from Element of Light, to the
scaley critters.

”The juicy flounder and the
tender chub/ who swim around
you when you leave the pub/
their mouth’s are open and they
will not shut/ unless you kiss
them all behind the hut.”

While listening to Hitchcock's
music, one can't help but notice
that he is a man who enjoys what
he does. He told Musician, ”I
never wanted to be anything but
asinger. l have no ambition but
1 am very persistent.”

It just may be that persistence
which has gotten him to where
he is today. His Element album,
on Relativity Records, was the
first independent release to reach
No. 1 on the college charts, and
it stayed there for six straight
weeks. His Globe album, on
A&M, promptly shot to No. 1 -one

When Terence Trent D’Arby
hits the Syria Mosque Ballroom
this Sunday night,Ihe"s sure to lay
down the hardline on dancing as
heperforms songs from his debut

' album, Introducing the Hardline

According to Terence Trent D’Ar-
by. D’Arby’s show should be
charged with lots of energy and
excitement, as reviews of his
shows so far have been ecstatic,

and he is generally being touted I

as ”the next big thing” on the
music scene.

D’Arby’s music, a combination
of rock, soul and R&B, is laden

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March 3l, I988

with emotion rarely found in pop
albums. Part of the reason for the
”earthy” quality of his music is
his voice —a cross between Otis
Redding and Sam Cooke at their
best.

Another reason for D’Arby’s
success is the experience he

_ channels into his music. D’Arby

has lived the lives of more than.
one person in his 25 years, and
his bio proves it. Born in New
York City and raised in Florida,
he is oftennmistaken for being En-
glish because of his ‘monniker
(which he came up with for just
that reason).

D’Arby was intelligent enough
that he was often allowed to skip

grades during his education. ”I
could have slept through school
and still got very, very good
grades,” he said, reflecting on his
parents’ stern attitude of ensuring
he received an education.

While his musical influences
range from the Jackson 5 to Pen-
tecostal gospel music, his early
heroes were boxers — namely
Thomas Hearns and Muhammad
Ali. ”I was very tall for my
weight,” D’Arby said, ”and very
long-armed and very fast, the ob-
vious comparison was to Thomas
Hearns. And, of course, every kid
at that time tried to box like Mu-

hammad Ali. So I would say

those arelthe two people I pat-
terned myself after.”

D’Arby would have finished
his college education as a jour-
nalism major if he had not been
lured into the Army to pursue his
then—promising boxing career. It
wasn't until after he had taken a
severe beating during about in
West Germany that he decided
he needed a career change, so he
took off the gloves and joined a

band called Touch — which he .

later quit just as they were about
to be signed.

After wandering aimlessly
around Europe for a year, he fi-
nally settled down in England

Ah album quickly followed
and wasted no time going plati,—

ing a big signal to America to be
on guard for his pending release.
Since Hardline was released last
fall, it has climbed its way to the
brink of the Top 20 and is likely
to force its way into the Top 10
and establish D’Arby as one of
the leading artists to look for in
the next decade.

convincing a. person that, yes,
they should take note of the cool
sounds coming out of the Califor-
nia underground.

surf music style and their marri-
age of Dave Brubeck’s ”Take
Five” and Led Zeppe|in’s
”Whole Lotta Love,” donate their
”Days of Pup and Taco,” and
their surrealistic visit to a battle

3 plain in Hell —- ”March of the

Melted Armymen.”

The best thing about No Age is
that there are no real losers on
this album. There is a problem
with acouple of the songs in they
are a bit too repetetive but none
the less good. Nothing here is
outright boring either, although
one song does come close. Lee
Ranaido, of Sonic Youth fame,
has been experimenting with the
lock—groove sound loops and a
sample, ’’Florida Power,” is at the
end of the first side. The album
label suggests that you should
only listen for two minutes. But,
if you're too lazy to change
sides  .

SST’s marketing is sharp. The
fact is that SST is presenting a bar-
gain that even Dennis Miller
would approve of. It will proba-
bly tempt people into investigat-
ing the artist's respective albums.

Diverse backrounds give

Deadly By Desire variety

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

Deadly By Desire may not be
posionous, but their music is
definitely contagious. They've
been spreading their lethal rock
’n’ roll throughout‘ the city since
July of 1987, and it's paying off.

Last Friday night at the Tri—State
Rock Competition, they finished
in an impressive second place.

Bassist Dave Cattley and drum-
mer Ben Cortes were the catalysts
for the formation of the band.
They placed an ad for a guitar
player and vocalist. Mark Fern
answered. Together, the three
men experimented with different
musical concepts for seven
months. Desiring a fuller, richer
sound, they drafted keyboardist

' John Deley and thus completed

their lineup.

That fuller, richer sound could
also be the product of various
musical backgrounds and in-
terests. Deley has played classi-
cal piano, jazz, Top 40 covers
and, for the past eight years, rock
’n’ roll in numerous bands.

Cattley and Cortes played in a
band that performed rock ’n’ roll
covers.

”We did Van Halen covers. It
was a high school band,” Cattley
said. A

Cattley and Cortes cited artists
Led Zeppelin, Rush, Lynyrd

going on.

Fortunately, the locations and
events of the film are its true cen-
terpiece. Prague and Geneva, if
this is where Lightness was
filmed, are gorgeous. As is the in-
vasion sequence, which is filmed
in black and white and in color
news-film style.

And, of course, the highly tout-
ed sex scenes are incredible. This
is a rare American film that actu-
ally deals with sex in a frank, very
unromantic way. lt is kinky and
absurd —- really refreshing.

Despite its flaws, I found The
Unbearable Lightness of Being
quite good.

Skynyrd and Van Halen as
favorites.

”Stewart Copeland [drummer
of the Police] and Neil Peart [of
Rush] are my main influences,"
Cortes stated.

I Fern’s musical interests include
older jazz, soul and Motown. He
played in a band when he was
younger. Back in England, where
he is from originally, he played

‘ 

One thing we've strug-
gled for was to find a
style that was as much

as possible unlike

someone else’s.
— Ben Cortes

in ”an overrated band that used
a drum machine,” he said.

One good thing came out of
that English band -— the name
Deadly By Desire. lt'was the
name of a song Fern-’s band used
to do. When his present group
couldn't agree on a name, he sug-
gested the old song title, and it
stuck.

While their different interests
and backgrounds have broad-

ened their musical horizons, the
band members insisted that the
influences do not come through
in their music. They've worked
hard to develop their own unique
sound, so much so that they don't

believe in playing covers.

”One thing we've struggled for
was to find a style that was as
much as possible unlike someone
else’s,” Cortes said.

Lyric and music ideas are
usually written by Fern. His lyr-
ics are mostly ambiguous with a
focus on social situations and un-
requited love. People and atti-
tudes are his inspiration. Other
members work on their specific
parts. Everyone has to work
together for a song to develop

- successfully.

”We get along great, musical-
ly. We've never had a serious ar-
gument, and we're all friends,”
Cattley said.

”Being in a band is like being
married,” Deley added.

Deadly By Desire is proud of
what they do and how they're do-
ing it. It's true that the band gains
personal satisfaction from their
uniqueness, but their objective is
to please the audience.

Said Fern, ”The nicest thing is
seeing people you don't know on
the dance floor and seeing peo-
ple you don’t know applauding
and meaning it.”

within a week of release.

His fans are exceptionally loy-
al and each year multiply like
flies in a pretty girl's smiling
mouth. His move to A&M
Records should ensure wider ex-
posure due to the major label's
ability to distribute Globe better
than Relativity could.

Yet, Hitchcock remains cau-
tious concerning his affiliation
with A&M due to his previous ex-
perience with a major label. ’’I
just hope this thing survives A&M
with a certain amount of integri-
ty,” he shrugged at Musician's in-
terviewer. ”We’re not costing
them much, so it shouldn't be too
bad.”

Robyn Hitchcock burst upon
the American scene in 1985 with
Fegmania! and his newly formed
band, the Egyptians (the Egypti-
ans are Andy Metcalfe and Mor-

ris Windsor, both originally Soft
Boys with Robyn). The release
was coordinated with a video for
”The Man with the Lightbulb
Head” that featured a Ken doll
with a G.E. screwed into his
socket

That same year he released
Gotta Let This Hen Out on Rela-
tivity. Recorded live at the Mar—
quee in London, it offered a
sampler of his best material to
that point. His full—ti|t rocking and
his bizzare stories made him an
instant club attraction.

in 1986, Robyn Hitchcock and
the Egyptians released their im-
pressive Element. It had a diverse
range of styles that included titles
and ”Bass,” ”Somewhere Apart”
and ”Lady Waters and the Hood-
ed One.” ”Somewhere Apart” is
intentionally reminiscent oflohn
Lennon's ”Remember” from his
Plastic Ono Band album and

Larry Wanke
Sophomore Ouarierback

  

  

 

”Lady Waters” is probably the
only song about the bubonic
plague that will make you hum
along.

Shortly after E/ement’s release,
Relativity issued Hitchcock's first
couple of albums in America.
Black Snake Diamond Role and
the accoustic solo, I Often Dream
of Trains are exactly the same as
their Brittish counterparts.

Groovy Decay, Robyn’s sec-
ond solo album, was bought up
by Hitchcock and deleted. It
seems that he hated the sound
and wanted to rewrite history. He
remixed the original demos for
Groovy Decay and issued them

as Groovy Decoy. lt’s amazing
that this man's demos are better
than a lot of peoples’ completed
albums.

In 1986 Hitchcock also
released a compilation of post-
Soft Boys material made up of un-
released songs and B—sides. Invisi-
ble Hitchcock’s cover shot
pictured Robyn clutching a bun-
dle of radishes in his hand.

This brings everything up to the
present and A Globe of Frogs. His
latest album is a lot more stark
than the richly produced Element
of Light. The songs range from the
bouncy ”Balloon Man” to the

Beatlesque ”Flesh Number”
Tilbrook of‘

One.” Glenn
Squeeze, Metcalfe’s other band,
sings background vocals on
"Flesh/’ eerily adding to the
Beatlesque sound.

Peter Buck of R.E.M. also plays
on A Globe of Frogs. His distinc-
tive acoustic guitar appears on
”Chinese Bones” and ”Flesh
Number One.” Buck, who is
joining Hitchcock on several tour

that he alienates anyone and
everyone, including Eugene. His
antics throughout the whole of
the film, and especially his con-
frontations with Toomey, the pla-
toon’s drill sergeant, make for
several enjoyable sequences.

In an early part of the film,
these men play an after-hours
game in which they each discuss
their individual fantasies of what
they would do for a week if it
were discovered that was all the
longer they had to live. Selridge,
odd-man-in as always, discusses
carnal thrills with an impossible
number of women. Wykowski
takes a more subtle turn by satis-
fying his libido with only one
femme, the Queen of England.
Hennesey says he would spend
it with his family. This answer is
met with the expected number of

jeers which would be expected
from a military barracks.

But what becomes a preview of
what we as an audience can ex-
pect to see comes from Eugene
himself. He wants to accomplish
three things. First, he wants to
lose his virginity. Second, to fall
in love with the perfect girl. And
third,_to win a Pulitzer Prize in
fiction.

Just to clue you in, we have to
wait for a future film to see him
win his literary prize.

What makes this film work best
is surprisingly not Simon's script
but the performances which have
gone into it. Matthew Broderick
seems to have been born to play
Eugene, the role which original-
ly won him a Tony Award when
he played the role on Broadway.
And he has never been better in
a role on film.

Senior Flanker

Corey Parker as Epstein turns in
a substantially calculated perfor-
mance for a formidably meaty
role. And Park Overall as Rowee—
na, the receptacle with which Eu-

gene's first fantasy, is,
accomplished, is practically
perfect.

But it is Christopher Walken as
the benevolently sadistic Sgt.
Toomey who really deserves
great praise. This is not only the
best role he's been offered in
years, but he also does his best
acting since his Academy Award-
winning role in 1978's The Deer
Hunter.

in all, Biloxi Blues isa fine film
with which to be entertained. It
doesn't require much from the
viewer, but it provides some
heartfelt entertainment, and in
my book, that's not all that bad.

THE PITT NEWS

Volleyball team lands four

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

Pitt coach Shelton Collier faced

the inevitable task of replacing

four highly skilled athletes
(Noreen Coughlin, Louise O’-
Shaughnessy, Lisa Stewart and

Krista Ziener) from this past year's

volleyball team which compiled
a 37-6 record and was considered
among the best in school history.

Collier could hardly contain his
enthusiasm yesterday as he an-
nounced the signing of four qual-
ity recruits for next year's Lady
Panthers.

Signing letters of intent to play
for Pitt next season were Deirdre

MacAulay, Heather Hollands,
Julie Shells and Sue Zonnerville.
MacAulay and Hollands were
standout performers for the Scar-
borough Solars which won the
Canadian National Junior Cham-
pionships in 1987. They were
both members of the Canadian
Provincial Team, a stepping stone
to the Canadian Olympic Team.
Collier seems pretty convinced
that MacAulay -— a 6-foot middle-
blocker —— will be a key player for
the Lady Panthers next season.
”Deirdre is an outstanding ath-
lete who will probably play
somewhere right away. It is a
matter of not so much if she will
play as it is a matter of where she

Tennis squad evens
record with victory  
over Slippery Rock

By Vince Longo

Staff Writer

The Pitt men's tennis team
turned back a ”hostile” Slippery
Rock team, 5-3, Tuesday in a
match which head coach George
Dieffenbach hailed as a great
team effort and a turning point in
the season.

’’It was a very good match with "

lots of team unity," said Dieffen-
bach. ”The team really wanted to
win this one. It was a very good
team effort It's a turning point
for the season.”

Sophomore Vivek Kumar
agreed with Dieffenbach’s senti-
ments, and offered that the hostil-
ity between the two teams was a
unifying force for the Panthers.

”The team was really unified
today because their team was
really hostile,” said Kumar.
”There’s been bad blood be-
tween the two teams for years.
Their top three guys [were partic-
ularly] hostile. There were a lot
of arguments. It was really kind
of nasty.”

The Panthers, 7-7, started the

nastiness off with a singles win by
No. 1-ranked Neil Meyerowich,
6-3, 6-2, over Mike Karijanian,
followed by a win by the Pan-
thers’ Jeff Mills, 6-2, 6-2, over
SRU’s Jonathon Donado. Pitt's
Greg Campbell had a harder time
with his opponent, Scott Jackson,
but still won in straight sets, 7-6,

Malone

 

Mark Malone

7-6.

The Panthers’ Vivek Kumar lost
to Jere Woodyard, 4-6, 3-6, and
fifth-ranked Paul Maben lost in
three sets 3-6, 6-1, 4-6 to Drew
Dearborn. The Panthers’ Dan
Winicour fell to the hands of
Glen Gerbino, 2-6, 6-7.

The Panthers entered the dou-

“ Wbles matches needing to win two’
of three and came away with two
.. wins. The third doubles match

was cancelled due to darkness.

Mi|ls—Maben defeated
Karijanian-Jackson 6-1, 6-2;
Meyerowich—Campbell defeated
Woodyard-Dearborn 6-4, 6-0;
and Kumar-Winicour versus
Donado-Gerbino was 6-7, 7-6,
5-5 before it was called. Even if
Slippery Rock would have won
the set, the Panthers would still
have won overall.

Tuesday's singles victory by

. Campbell was career win No.46,

which puts him in a tie for the all-
time Pitt career singles victories
mark. The record will most like-
ly fall on Monday, April 4 at the
home match against Carnegie
Mellon. s
.Dieffenbach cannot say
enough about what Campbell has
done for the team.
”He’s an outstanding student 
a team leader, and he's been very
unselfish in helping the team.
He's a very hard worker.”
Starting time for the match
against CMU is 3:30 p.m.

may be

(AP) —— Quarterbacks Mark Ma-
lone and Bubby Brister said they
welcome the challenge of com-
peting with the newly acquired
Todd Blackledge for the Pitts-
burgh Steelers’ starting job.

But Malone, the NFL’s least-
effective quarterback last season,
is aware of rumors the Steelers
will trade him — or even release
him — before the start of training
camp in July.

”The Steelers have to do what
they have to do,” Malone said. ’’I
feel I can help this football team,
and I'm capable of playing, and
l have a lot of years left in me. If

will play,” noted Collier.

On the other hand, Hollands
brings with her that all-important
attribute for every successful
team + a winning attitude. Col-
lier commented on the 15-9
outside- hitter: ”We lost some
great attitudes in our graduating
seniors; Heather has that special
attitude along with being a fine
player.” 2

Once again, the Canadian
Pipeline proves productive for

Pitt. MacAulay and Hollands will’

join former Lady Panther stand-
outs Ulana Kohutiak and O’-
Shaughnessy as well as current
Pitt player Michele Adamson as
members of Collier’s Canadian

Connection.

The third Pitt recruit is.Sheils,
a junior college All-American.
Collier was pleased with the
6—foot outside-hitter’s decision to
attend Pitt.

’’It was sweet to steal such a
great player right out from under
Big East rival Syracuse. She will
help us tremendously.- Julie has
the ability to be a dominant play-
er at the national level and will
compete for the starting spot va-
cated by Lisa Stewart. She chose
our program over Penn State in
a hotly contested recruiting bat-

. tle,” said Collier.

The last Pitt recruit is Zonner-
ville, a 5-10 middle-blocker from

quality recruits

Rush-Henrietta High School in
Rochester, N.Y. Collier is happy
she decided to cast her lot with
the Lady Panthers.

”We had Sue ranked as the
second best high school player in
the East. A talented middle-
blocker, she will challenge for a
starting position immediately and
will definitely be an excellent col-
lege player at our level,’’ ob-
served Collier.

With the addition of four top-

notch recruits to his program,
Collier expects the competition to
be fierce for starting positions on
next year's squad.

Mark Malone

Brister, a third—year pro who
has a strong arm but little ex-
perience, said of Blackledge,

”Bring him on.”

’’I feel like l_’m in line for it, just
like anyone else. It's wide open,”
said Brister, the Steelers’ third-
round draft choice in 1986.
”Whoever does the job will have
it. You can't ask any more than
that.”

Steelers Coach Chuck Noll said
Brister is ”much more ready [to
play] this year than he was last
year at this time. He's coming to
a point where he has to be ready
to go. And he has to have an op-
portunity.” .

If the Steelers trade Malone,
Brister and Blackledge will like-

ly duel for the starting job in train-
ing camp. ‘
’’I hope to win the starting job,
and I'm going to do everything I
can in the next couple of months
to do that,” said Blackledge, who
shuttled between the bench and
the starting lineup in five seasons
with the Kansas City Chiefs.
Blackledge said he likes Noll’s
policy of picking a starting quar-
terback, then staying with him.
”There was never a real sense
of commitment to me as [Kansas
City's] starting quarterback,” he
said. ”So it was constantly an in-
and-out situation.”

 
 

Baseball team hurting

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team lost both
sides of a doubleheader to Vil-
lanova Monday at Trees Field,
bowing 22-0 in the opener and
10-3 in the second game.

The losses dropped Pitt to 1-7,
while Villanova improved to
10-12.

The Panthers also suffered
another loss Monday — the serv-
ices of catcher Jon »Weaver.
Weaver was hit in the mouth by
a pitch and suffered a broken jaw.

Head coach Bobby Lewis said,
”We now have two key people
out. it was tough losing Dave
[Westwood], and now Jon.”

Westwood injured his leg slid-
ing into base against Villanova
earlier this season.

”Some days you get the bear,
and some days it gets you. Mon-
day, it got us. We have to start
anew. Every game is a new game.
I hope our experience Monday
will help us this weekend,” Lewis
said.

The Panthers will travel to Se-
ton Hall for a series of games this
weekend.

‘I “This could be the best" or one

recruited two good players, and
I think that we have four.

”Time will tell, but we did sign

successful players,” added
