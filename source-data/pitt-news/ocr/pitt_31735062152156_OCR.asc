Working -in "dramatic shows on

asked to do the partzof. John Dillinger,
in a news .dramatization. The. -blond
senior was down at the time with a
cold that had roughened his voice and
made it ﬂat and low. I
Cliff Daniels, head announcer at
WCAE, liked McKee’s‘work as Dil-
linger, and’-‘fbegan casting‘, him_ in
‘larger parts. Then McKee became a
regular member ,9f_‘__-the .NBC station,
working in the evenings and goiilgto

versity. He has -_been active in Pitt
Players and on the University debate
team and will participate ‘in a debate

“with the University of Washington in

March, which will be "broadcast b_v

‘ WCAE over the Red Network of NBC.

The new announcer attributes his
radio success to nothingfmore__tha1i
a “break.” One o'f'the'regular' actors
of KDKA was out ‘of town when Mc-
Kee stepped into the office in search
of a job. “Can you be leading man?”
he was asked. “Sure,” he said. He
was tri_ed_ out, and’ soon became a

University Team Finds Real
Competition In Contest
On Electric Utilities

In a hotly-contested and somewhat
informal debate, two Marquette Uni-
versity debaters traded -words on the
advisability of governmental owner-
ship of electric utilities with a pair
of University representatives before
Inquiry Forum Monday.

With the Marquette team, made up
of Paul Noelke and Steven Keene,
arguing the negative side, an-d Ber-
nard Mclienna, C39, and Edward
Springer, C39, handling‘ affirmative
argtnnents, the four men discussed
the question, “Resolved: That All
Electric Utilities Should Be Govern-
mentally Owned and Operated.” The
debate was in the Oregon style.

McKenna Speaks First
McKenna, first speaker for the af-

firmative, declared that regulation of"

electric utilities by the government
is impossible because of the great
wealth available to fight it and said
that regulation would be “an insult
to public intelligence.” He reviewed
evils of private ovmership and eco-
nomic advantages of government
ownersliip, especially cheaper rates;
and a~;lvo-cared establishment of re-
-giona. monopolies. ‘ ‘
Ma.rquet.te's first deb-ater, Paul
Noelke, allexnpied to prove that there.
is no necessity for government own-
ership in view of cheaper rates and
more efiicient management.
clared that the problem
solved by governmental regulation.
“We favor,” he concluded, “moderate
discretion and discreet n1-odera-tion."

Marquette Starts Questions

Keane, the secon-d speaker from the
Milwaukee school, then quizzed
Springer. ‘His mai-n contention, dis-
puted very vigorously by Springer,
was that government ownership would
add enormously to the national debt.

Questioning McKenna, Noelke then
contended that “politics” would be
rife under governmental ownership,
while Springer cited examples of po-
liticalwire-pulling in the interest of
private utilities.

Keane closed the negative argu-
ment by emphasizing the possibility
of ineﬂicient _governmental manage-
ment and charging that the postoﬂice
system has been very ineflicien-tly ad-

from Cambridge University, will ad-
dress the Philological Society of the
University ‘on Friday evening, in

Dr. Solm-sen is an authority on
Greek philosophy._He was a pupil of
Professor Werner Jaeger, now of the
University of Chicago, and took his

convinced they're mild. Camels help my
digestion—and they never get on my
nerves or tire my taste!"

 
  
 
 
 

  
   

GARDNER W. Iaarrsou. Class of 1939, says: "There-are
plenty of reasons why it's Camels for me. Camels help
when rm in for a‘ long session- give me a ‘lift’ that keeps
me ‘going. I like my chow :00. Smoking Camels army
meals and afterwards puts me in fine fettle where diges-
tion's concerned. ‘I'd walk 2. mile for a Camel.” 

_ Camels set you right the whole day through. A: meal-_
times Camels aid digestion-speeding up the ﬂow of di-
gestive ﬂuids, increasing alkalinity—-‘- bringing you a‘ sense
of well-being. When you're tired, get an invigorating
"lift” in energy with a Camel. Camels set you right!

 
       
   
 

The subject of» Dr. Solmsen’s ad-
dress will be “Plato’s Religion,” a
topic on which he spoke at the Har- -
vard tercente-nary celebration.

tourney, but this year the sponsors,
Mazeski and Feely, ran into several
snags, not the least of which were
the innumerable worries of Mazeski
over a losing wrestling team, in
molding; the ‘tourney plans. NOW.
however, plans for botlrthe intra-

mural and intei~frate1'nity tourneys '

have been completed and the two
tourneys will be run off at the ‘same
time.  ' ‘

All of. the matches will be held in

fraternity meets in the late afternoon

winners of the independent matches
to determine the intramural cham-
pions of the school.

Coach Mazeski is offering the nov-
ices a chance to get into condition
by working out under his direction in
the Stadium any afternoon after 4
o’clock. Mazeski hopes to uncover a
few grapplers for his varsity and
freshman squads and a few good
scrappers in the 1_1_8 and 126 pound
divisions would be‘ particularly wel-
come.

If there are four or more com-
plete teams entered in the interfra-

the winner. Further information
about the fraternity meets will be
mailed to the individual houses by

SFA Acts

FA DID ITSELF proud last
night in the “801 lounge” at
its first regular meeting of the
new term. It did itself proud.
ﬁrst, because it became alive
to an issue which is really not
terriﬁcally important or wide in
its scope, by itself, but which
considered along "with other
things involves something quite
different in importance.

When SFA. recommended mi-
nority student membership on
the publications board by sug-
gesting that that board be in-
creased by two, bringing -the
total to six, the membership of
the board which selects the next
year’s editors and businessman-
agers of undergraduate publica-
tions each May, it only began its
latest and most ambitious pro-
gressive movement.

By accepting a proposal for
an amendment to change the
constitution so that a more dem-
ocratic election of officers, and
a lessening of administration-
faculty control can be achieved,
SFA took a big step in the direc-
tion Qf alleviating some ofthc
present incongruities of a repre-
sentative body. For such things
a student body should feel satis-
faction in knowing that the men
and women whom they have
chosen to legislate for them are
moving in the right direction.

For Beauty

UCH has been said on both
— _-.— sides of 21 controversy that
at most schools is really no con-
troversyﬁthat at‘ most schools
has really no sides, and that at
most schools does a great deal of
good for the university or col-
lege concerned. ,

This school year of 1936-37
has seen, forthe first time in
four years, the revival of a
movement to recognize beauty in
the women on this campus. But
out of,.a clear blue sky which
usually. “holds only "a balmy,
harmless little cloud, comes
somewhat of a small tornado.
The ﬁgure, perhaps, is bad, but
no more disconcerting to stu-
dents who ar'e_pot grinding their
own political axes, but merely
attempting to do some goodfor
their U:ni’versity_,\;than that flcecy
ball to people who like sky
3 conventional -blue. 

Butthat sort of conv ntio__ i
passing in ourliu '. I ‘ ‘ V , _
should be the ﬁrlst to"-'recogni-r.e

this. Our Rose Bowl tocnti-al.§
team should be an evidence -0. 7
that. High school students. pro-
spective collegc students. do not
only peer into libraries or labo-
ratories of a university in the
modern selection of their colleg-
iate alma mater. There is a bit
more than that today. We are
living in an age of jazz. pomp.
football maniacs, and the glare
of Hollywood glamour. At least
many of us are living thus
for a considerable portion of the
time. The University of Pitta‘-
burgh cannot yet compete with
Harvard, Yale and many other
institutions which enjoyed a
speedy. full, early growth. This
University is growing: the Cath-
edral alone substantiates this. _

But today We are dealing in
beautysqueens. Just what part
can they and do—they play in
our educational system? VVcll.
they are a minus quality in real
education, but very much a plus
quality in our modern advertis-
ing and publicity-mad age.
Then, too, a girl may have some-
thing on the looks, if not too
much on the books.

We say that a university must
advertise itself. Some schools
are in a retentive stage. that is.
the stage when an institution can
lean back and say, “Our class of
1829 had two presidents, five
poets, seven millionaires, two
great historians, etc. That school
can demand its students to come
to it, rather than it to them.

However, other schools are in
a pioneering, or the more ad-
vanced competitive stage. The
University of Pittsburgh is in
a competitive stage. Anyhow.
we think the ladies should get
a break.

The Courts Again

INCE THE‘ mad days of the
“Reconstruction” era, th e
United States has traveled a- long
and troublous road, and it seems
implicit inthe history of the last
ﬁfty years that the use of the
injunction in labor disputes is
out of joint with the times. A
clumsy and bitter device, the in-
junction operates to the advan-
tage of one party in the dispute,
warps out of true meaning the
phrase “in the public interest,”
which should be the guiding
theme of all governmental ac-
tions. : - '
Last week recourse was had to
this 19th century al'lElCl1l“0l‘1l.S1:l!:?
device when Judge Paul V.
Gadola of the Michigan Federal
District Court issued an injunc-
tion restraining the sit-clown
strikers from occupying the
property of the General Motors
Corporation. Although the pur-
pose of equity is to prevent the
doing ofan injustice, it seems
that by championing of one 
terest against another, the court
is a participating party to an in-
justice. ,

If the injunction is suc.ccssfui,
it can mean only one thing: loss
of the strike by the strikers. Yet
by the-. very fact that the strike
exists, there must be some griev-
ance on the part of the strikers
The effect, then, of the in.junc-
tion is to deny them the priv-
ilege—-and the right-«of enforc-
ing redress of those grievances.

Thus, by this one situation.
the old thesis that the courts
tend to uphold property rights
to the (letriment of human rights
is again clemonstrated clearly.
Far from being a. referee. the
courts are aligned on the siclr: of
the ernployers, They stand cou-
victed brr evidence o£.t11eir own

Why must 3. Pitt student publicize
the fact ('u1co1'1‘ectly. in our esLin1a-
tion) that Pitt girls go 01? campus:
for their dates and that men go over
to PCW, Tech, etc., for t.hei.r dates?
Such is really not the case. Or, per-
haps the anon:.*n1ous authoxroazs of
CLF is unable to procure a date vsilzh
one of the more desirable men on
campus and is thus cifectiiig a 1‘ai.l1er

it is our guess that the girl (sans
lipstick, a Simpson haircut, and the
ability to Westchester) who is be-
moaning the fact, sits at home the
evenings of all the big dances .
Regardless, either instance merits
some reply, and we feel that it is
within our realm to leap to the de-

"It’s preposterous,” a u d i e n e e s
claimed after seeing Tobacco Road.
“Things like that just don’t happen.”

llut they have happened-——a.nd with
a vengeance. Recently we read in
the paper of the I.nar1'iage of 9-year-
old Eunice Winstead to 22-year-old
Charlie Johns. And we wonder.

Sitting back in the luxury of an up-
holstered chaise, pulling: on a pipe and
reading Santayana is strangely ideal-
istic and it soothes our nerves. But
reading‘ of the “case of the moun-
tain bride” in our daily news sheet
je1‘k;'. us back, like the swing of a
weig;lIted pendulum, to a bizarre sort
of reality.

According to Attorney General J.
W. Wolfenbmger, whose circuit in-
cludes the remote town of Sneed-
ville, Tennessee, there is no law for-
bidding such n1arria.ges in the state.
A law prohibiting county clerks from
issuing licenses to persons under 16
years of age was repealed in 1935.

gully married, although the husband
several weeks ago gave his wife a toy
doll that shuts its eyeswhen you tilt
its head; although the young wife is
just completing her third grade in
grammar school; although the moun-
tain bride will be more adept at cut-
ting paper dolls than baking Tennes-
see niuﬁins for her six-foot husband.
* * *

Personal feelings in the Sneedville
case are apt to be nondescript. We
say, “My, that's awful!” and turn to
Heywood Broun. Or we scratch our
head, and then switch on the radio.

Yet there is something deeply sig-
niﬁcant, something that bores down
to the roots of human nature in this
unusual. segregated incident. It is
the primate spirit of pithecanthropus
er-ectus; it is the missing link between
the neanderthal and homo sapiens.

This is the animal in the man; the
se.lf—same animal‘ that we found in
Tobacco Road. Then, too, the ease
of the mountain bride would make a
vigorous drama,
