Pitt Chest Drive
Planning Underway

"A 100 in l--a hundredorganizations benefited by one!” That’s
the motto and the watchwords of the 1950 Pitt Chest drive, now in
the preparatory stage and due to start its first fund-raising cam-

paign November 8.

The drive, under the helm of Chairman Earl Jacob, aided by
assistant chairman, Marie Homisak, secretary, Ronald Ecker, and

Frat Splits

Over Bias

Phi Epsilon Phi national frat-
tetnity has been rocked by a wave
of dissension following the dis-
affiliation of its Connecticut Uni-
versity chapter, droppedb y the na-
tional council for pledging a negro.

In protest to the national office's
action with regard to the Connecti-
cut chapter, the City College of
New York chapter disaffiliated it-
self. _ _

Several other Phi Ep chapters
are expected to withdraw in protest
also, according to Melvin Linn,
chapter treasurer of the City Col-
lege chapter.

The Upsilon (Connecticut) chap-
ter was suspended after receiving an
injunction from the national office.

Irving Faigen, president of the
Pitt Zeta chapter here, says of
the situation, “Although we of
Zeta chapter are completely op-
posed to Upsilon’s action in ignor-
ing the mandate of the national
council, we wish to go on record
as being in favor of living up to
the spirit as well as the words of

-our constitution, that is; of being
non-sectarian.”

The local chapter is made up
entirely of Jewish students.

Cheer Bloc
Gets Brush

Under the direction of Ben Grady,
‘varsity swimming mentor, the Stu-
dent’Demonstration Bloc is being
whipped into shape for the first
home game with Rice.

With the aid of cheerleaders, Al-,
pha Phi Omega members, and drafted
men from the swimming team, the
section in the stadium used by the
bloc was numbered and lettered
ii Friday.

Varsity-. letterman will also be
used as monitors in various sections
of the bloc to distribute capes, main-
tain order and aid the ‘cheerleaders
in completing the formations.

The main difficulty so far has
been the lack of colored capes for
members of the section. It has been
suggested that paper or cardboard
squares could be used, or the end
and side rows could be eliminated
without damaging the effect of the

J formation.

Education Began in Nazi Prison

By CLARK SUTTON

Football games, cokes, dances, hayrides . .

. all the things

that American students expect from high school were not in the
curriculum of Paul Weiner, Czech-born Pitt student.
Weiner’s preparation for college was carried on behind the

bars of a German concentration

camp where there were no such

things as snap courses. Each question asked, each answer given

from professors who were fellow
prisoners, carried with it the pos-
sible threat of death.

These classes, banned by the
Germans, were carried on in se-
cret and were constantly interrupt-
ed by guards eager to carry out
orders.

, Paul’s long trip to Pittsburgh
began in 1942 when he and his
family were moved by the Germans
from their home in Prague to the
German concentration camp of
Terezin. Too young to work,
Weiner had much time on his
hands. When elderly professors
offered to teach the young priso-
ners, they grabbed at the chance.

llidden Education
For almost three years this hit-
or-miss education continued, even
though the Ger.mans came close to

1 discovering and eradicating these

hidden scholars. In 194-4, the older
people were moved from the camp.
Along with his teachers went
Paul’s father and brother-missing
to this day.

Now old enough to work, Weiner
joined in with the others in carry-
ing out the orders of those who
kept him in slavery. With inade-
quate and improper food, filthy and
unhealthy living conditions, Paul
and his former classmates manag-
ed to at least retain what they

PAUL WEINR

g o o 0
learned.

In 1945 the Russian liberators
rolled in Terezin and Paul and his
mother were free to return to their‘

home in Prague. Asked how he
felt about the Russians, Paul
replied, “They were my libera-

tors. To me they could have been’
anybody...Turks...men from mars...
anybody. We were free.” Today,
Prague is behind the Iron Curtain

Service Exam Given

Naval ROTC
Competitions Set

The fifth nation-wide examina-
tion for its College Training Pro-
gram has been scheduled by the
Navy for Dec. 9, 1950. It is open
to high school seniors and grad-
uates between the ages of 17 and
21.

The students selected by these
competitive examinations will be
assigned to NavalReserve Officers’
Training Corps units which are lo-
cated in various universities and
college in the United States.

If accepted by the college, they
will be appointed Midshipmen,
U.S.N.R., and will have their tui-
tion, books, and normal fees paid
for by the Government.

In addition they will receive pay
at the rate of 350.00 a month for
the four-year period.

Upon graduation they will be
commissioned as officers of the
Navy or Marine Corps.

Applications can be obtained

from Mr. Ebert in Room 809.

Players Card
Ticket Offer

Admission to Pitt Players produc-
tions thisyear will be sold in the
form of “chit” tickets.

The chits are general tickets which
must be exchanged at the Student
Desk for a reserve seat.

Last year, Players sold subscrip-
tion books of four tickets, sold for
the price of three. Each one of these
tickets was good for only one per-
formance.

Under a new plan for subscription
books, students can use the sub-

scription tickets for any of the plays.

If desired four tickets can be used
for one play.

Subscription tickets are the same
as "c;hit” tickets in that they must
be turned in at the Student Desk for
reserve seats.

Chapel Services

The Reverend J. Victor Murtland,i

campus pastor to Lutheran students,
will speak at the Wednesday service
at 1:00 p.m. on Oct. 11 in lleinz
Chapel. Reverend Murtland’s sub-
ject will be “What’s the Use?”

Doris Deliman, president of the
Pitt Lutheran Student Association,
will act as student leader.

The Heinz Chapel Choir, directed

A by Theodore M. Finney, will sing

the anthem, ‘'0 Bread of Life” by

' Isaac-Christiansen.

\

iCoast Guard
Seeks Officers‘

Competitive examinations for ad-
mission to the Coast Guard Academy
will be held in Pittsburgh on Feb-
ruary 19 and 20, 1951.

Unmarried men between 17 and 22
who have completed high school and
who possess the physical qualifica-
tions are eligible to take the exami-
nation. Further information may be
obtained from the Commandant (PTP),
U.S. Coast Guard, Washington, 25,

and Paul feels differently about
the Russians.

Left for America

When conditions in Prague began
to take on the aspect of the Cer-
man occupation, Paul and his
mother felt it was time to pull
out. They applied for entrance into‘
America. Pending their quota num-
her, they went to Canada, and in
19-19 they were at last allowed to
enter our country.

Moving to Wasliington, Paul
was eager to carry on his educa-
tion and selected the University
of Pittsburgh. The Phi lipsilon
Pi fraternity is furnishing his
room and board while he is paying
for his tuition and fees.

Impressed By America

It’s a great life for Paul. En-
rolled in the College, he hopes to
major in the social sciences with
an emphasis on political science.
_It’s quite different for Paul now,
this business of learning. In the

massive Cathedral, which still
awes him, he feels much more
academic freedom.

Fascinated by the American

way of living, impressed by the
fullness of a real education, gra-
tified by American friendliness,
Paul hopes that his future will be
much more pleasant than the past
in this land which he has “grown
to love and wants to see more of.”

As for American girls, Paul
echoes the world wide sentiment
upon seeing a beautiful girl..

“Gee whiz.”

A Discordant Note

The news that the marching band will go to the game at North-
western and not to the one at Notre Dame strikes a discordant
note.

It would be ideal, of course, if the band could attend both
games. Besides entertaining the fans at half time, giving moral
support to both the team and students, its excellence serves as
a good reflection on the University. Fiscal difficulties, however
preclude the band from performing at both games. It is here that
the discordant note is sounded. The choice of which game to
attend is unhappy.

' Under the special train rates to the Notre Dame game it seems
assured that more students will go to South Bend than to Evan-
ston. At the Notre Dame game it will not only receive more sup-
portfrom Pitt supporters but will also have more to give support
to. In addition, the Notre Dame game will be televised, thereby
giving the band a far larger audience than it will get at North-
western; and also giving the band more publicity than it would
otherwise get.

And another factor which we don’t like to consider and which
we hope doesn't happen, is that the Pitt team will in all prob-
ability not fare too well with the Irish. Their team will undoubt-
ably be the chief attraction. But we don’t think their superiority
extends to bands. And to use a sportcasters phrase, "the Pitt
band has never been defeated, tied or, scored upon.” We are
certain that our band would maintain this enviable record at
Notre Dame.

Okay, if

A rumor circulating on the campus last week had it that the
freshmen were going to revolt against the Men's Council pro-
gram and burn their dinks on ODK Walk. The uprising, however,
failed to materialize and the frosh are still loyally sporting their
dinks.

We view this abortive action with mixed feelings. It’s okay,
we feel, if the idea originated with the freshmen and was pro-
moted by ‘hem. They have a right to display their disapproval of
something which directly affects them. A better way to demon-
strate their opposition, however, would have been to select a
deputation to air their grievances before Council.

On the other hand, if the discontent was conceived and in-
stigated by upperclassmen, as some believe, then it is open
only to condemnation, Upperclassmen because they are older
and allegedly maturer, should guide freshman wisely, not mis-
guide them unwisely. Their influence should be constructive
and not the kind that inspires sensational irresponsibility.

ln Passing

The recently inaugurated. Tuck Shop style service in the
Cafeteria deserves a word of praise in passing. It certainly should
do much toward removing the congestion that is a permanent fea-
‘ture of the Red and Blue Tuck Shops.

Tip to some hustling economics major:
On the sly, make a quick six-weeks survey of downtown sport-
ing goods shops and department stores. Find out if the sales of

of those big car robes jump.

If student Congress‘ etiquette watchdog, Decorum Chairman
Andy Schurman, gets serious about cracking~down on Stadium
drinking, quite a few Pitt students and many of the trolley-car

alumni will have to find some way
to keep warm in that big wind-
swept saucer up on the hill.

Charlie and Harold, the elevator
operators, already have the hot
brick concession all tied up.

"Pool-playing” is not

That's a cue: ]ohn—Burbidge, an
English retail training student here,

ing the World Series on television
last week. He confessed his in-
terest wasn't just pure love of the
game, though he's “played a bit”
of cricket, baseball’s English
cousin. ‘

He said he had "put in for a
sweep" with fifteen other students.
Just like a conservative English-
man should, he picked the Yanks.

By JACK MARKOWITZ

Seems that nearly everyone
wants to go to college these days.

And that creates a couple of big
problems. First, what is to be done
about the large number of people
who want higher education but can-
not afford it. Second, assuming
that everyone who wants a college
education gets an opportunity to
have one, aren’t the professions
going to be terrifically overcrowded
eventually?

_Well Dr. James B. Conant, pre-
sident of Harvard, has been trying
to figure out a way of reconciling
the increased demand for higher
education with future employment
opportunities in the professional
fields.

Dr. Conant, in effect, would re-
serve, but not by edict, the four-
year college for those students
with professional ambitions and
ability. These students could pre-
sumably enter on careers of their
choice with a fair degree of con-
fidence, the professions not being
overcrowded with men of inferior
ability.

For chase of sub-professional
ambitions and aptitudes, the Har-
vard president would institute the
' ‘two-year community college plan. ”

As outlined in Dr. Conant’s
"Our College System: A Re-evalu-
ation” in the New York Times
Magazine of June 4, 1950, this’
plan would provide two years of
free higher education in centers
located near the students’ home.

The curriculum would include a
liberal arts course, and, more im-
portant, a systematic program of
vocational counseling and testing
with a careful view toward future
employment opportunities in the
sub-professional. fields.

Dr. Conant’s plan is admittedly
postulates on the student's will-
ingness to criticize his own capa-
bilities, and finding himself un-
suited to the professions, to ac-
cept a sub-professional career.
And that, I think, is the weak
spot of the proposal.

I think that the demand for
higher education is based, not so
much on a desire for intellectual
betterment, as on the attraction
the professions hold for the
modern student.

And those that do aspire to the
professionswould, I think, not be
satisfied, regardless. of their
capability or lack of it, with
anything less than the four-year
college. ’

But Dr. Conant assumes, and
not without reason, that eventually,
by the prospects of future “frus-
trations” in overcrowded profes-
sional fields, those borderline stu-
dents who may not have the stuff
to enter the professions would turn
to the community colleges._

Registration, bookstore, and

cafeteria lines aren’t the only

queues of tired, protesting students, these days.Collegiates
squirm under their blue and gold dinks as a dull tread from match-
ing recruits echoes through Skyscraper U.

And the uneasy feeling has spread over campuses throughout
the country. From The Crown, Kings College, comes the follow-

ing note on the problem.

Father Mahoney. Prefect of Reli-
gion. was conducting a religion class
last week and was attempting to
find out whether the class was pre-
doninantly Arts or Science students.

Firsthe askeit “Are you pre-med?"

No answer.

"Are you pre-law’). . .pre-dental?"
Still receiving no answer the good
father asked, “Aren't you pie-am-
thing?"

A voice from the rear of the room
promptly came up with, “Yes, Father,
Pre-induction.”

From the University of Detroit
comes an interesting idea Men's
Council may or may not profit by.
It seems they have a valuable prac-
tice of circulating five one dollar
bills among their frosh, with hasten-
ing acquaintance as the aim.

The bills are marked with a big
red X as an optimistic assurance
that they eventually will be returned.

But this fall, the first week of class-

es went by, freshmen were slappin,
each other on the backs in greeting,
and, as reported by Detroit’s Varsity
News, only two of the bills had been
returned.

What with cut budgets this year,
Men's Council probably wouldn't
care to run the risk, even if they did
alert all local bars of dinks with
red greenbacks. Friendship, expec-
ially in Detroit, can be too valuable.

ii! it!

At long last there comes a claim
to distinction for the students who
just don’t join anything. By trans-
ferring to Penn State, they can be-
come easily the most envied guys
on campus.

F roth, State's humor magazine, is
sponsoring a contest to find the Mr.
and Mrs. Nobody on the campus.
These two willbe the officers of the
Broken Wheel Hat society of the
Pennsylvania State College, founded
this fall by Froth.

It will be the modified single
wing of Alpha Epsilon Phi against
the T of Phi Mu on Friday at 3:30,
when the two sororities launch
what they hope will be the begin-
ning of intersorority touch football
competition at Pitt.

Schenley Oval will be the game

‘ site.

The contest resulted out of a
challenge hurled by AEPhi Joan
Reichman to Gerry Pendro of Phi
Mu. When Miss Pendro relayed the
‘challenge to her sorority sisters,
it was accepted and a call for
players went out among the Phi
Mu ranks.

Male Coaches
It is believed only one previous
intersorority football game has
been played between Pitt sorori-
ties. That game was back in 1948

and the contestants were the same
AEPhis mentioned above and the
tri-Delts. The game ended in a
12-12 tie.

The Phi Mus, new to the sport
of touch football, will rely on the
teachings of three male coaches,
Joe Kenny, Paul Black, and Alvin
Cappozi, to successfully work the
T. Some 13 candidates answered
the football call issued last week,
and several closed sessions have
been held at the Phi Mu practice
field (the backyard of the Lambda
Chi Alpha house.)

Weight in Line

Dolores (Dottie) Graf, 130-pound-
er from Oliver High, will perform at
the all-important quarterback spot.
Flanking her will be halfbacks
Gerre Seamens, 102, from Home-
stead, and Sue Delphy, a swivel-
hipped 105-pound runner from Pea-

‘Les F emmes’ Football Ret 

body.

More weight, however, will be
evidenced on the line. The ends
are Mary Grace Munn, 120, of Ali-
quippa, and Betty Dunlap, 118,
from Perry. Nancy O'Connor“, 120,
from Swissvale will be at center.

Although fielding an inexpe-
rienced squad, Captain Pendro
was confident of victory. She
stated:

"Being ladies, both on and off
the field, we look forward to a
clean, hard-fought victory.”

Secret Workouts

Meanwhile, in the Alpha Epsilon
Phi camp, Coach Joan Reichman,
lone veteran of the 1948 squad,
has been conducting secret work-
outs at an undisclosed practice
field.

A Freshmen Athletic Program

Set Up for Next Week

A second Freshman Week will
come to Pitt this fall, but it will
include only male freshmen. For the
first time in the University’s history,
the intramural program extends a
welcomed hand to all incoming
freshmen in an effort to bring out
their athletic potentialities.

The program has been branded
the Freshmen All-Campus Athletic

fWeek Sports Program bY its co-

authors, Ben Grady, varsity swim-
ming coach, and Leo C. Bemis,

".lM Director. The program also has

the complete backing of Athletic
Director Tom Hamilton.
' Freshman Week will start next
Monday, Oct. 16, and continue
through Friday, Oct. 20.

Several Purposes
Its purpose can be broken down
into three distinct categories:
1- To secure recognition for

w frosh students as athletic champ-

ions in their class.

2 - To acquaint new students
with their fellow classmates and to
introduce these new freshmen, as
potential members, to the honorary
athletic fraternity, Sigma Delta Psi.

3 - To give freshmen the oppor-

tunity to display their prowess not
i only to the varsity coaches but al-

so to pit their ability against that
of their classmates.

Gridders Barred
All male freshman students are
eligible to compete in all events ex-

cept those students out for fresh-

man football. Football players, if
able to shy away from practice,
will be eligible to participate in
all events except football. Varsity
coaches

gibility.

Pitt Stadium will be the scene of
competition for football, basket-
ball, track, and baseball events.

Trees Pool will host the mermen

and Schenley Golf Course will enter-

tain the golfers.

A detailed program of events and
a list of instructions for partici-
pants will appear in Friday's News.

will determine final eli-

varsity openings. Audrey Cohen,
110 pounds, and Helen Josephs,
a hard-charging 115-pounder, have
been running at the halfback. spots
while Coach Reichman, at 122,
operates at quarterback. A transfer
student from West Virginia, Ann
Roman, 112, and Joan Azen, a 120-
pounder from Mt. Mercy, are at the
ends while 125-pound Center Joan
Seiner, also of Allderdice, com-
pletes the varsity lineup.
No Ladies Here

Although not ready to comment
on AEPhis’ chances of victory,
Coach Reichman had this to say:

“Not having been ladies off the
field, we will be ladies on the
field. We will endeavor to give
our illustrious opponents a good
clean game. May the best ladies
win.”

State’s Easy 41-7 Victory
Dims Football Outlook,

Gridiron ‘Dog Days’ Here Again

By WILL DOERGE

COLUMBUS, OHIO - It’s going to be a long season for Len
Casanova’s Pitt‘ Panthers. Football fortunes at the University
have fallen into another depression era.

In Pitt's 41-7 loss to Ohio State here Saturday, it was evi-
dent that the Panthers aren't going anywhere this year, and may
consider themselves lucky to even win two games.

Rice comes to Pittsburgh this
Saturday to meet Pitt in the Stad-
ium opener, and the unbeaten Owls
figure to romp at-will, a la Ohio
State.

‘Dog Days’ Here
inept performance by the
against the, Buckeyes
marked the return of the "dog days”
of the Clark Shaughnessy "T” era,
and Mike Milligan’s 1947 team.
Casanova’s edition could easily
rival the 1-8 record of Mike's team
that year.

A kindly gesture on Wes Fesler’s
part prevented the Jungle Cats from
being humiliated more than they
were. The Buckeye coach removed
his first stringers from the lineup
with the score 41-0 at the half,
and let his Jayvees play the rest
of the game.

Panthers Befuddled

The Pitt backfield men were com-
pletely befuddled on defense by
Ohio State's passing, just as they
were at Duke the week before. Buck-
eye receivers easily outstripped the
Panther defenders, and passer Vic
Janowicz had no trouble pitching
perfect strikes to them for big
gains.

Janowicz threw three touchdown
passes in the first quarter, and a
fourth in the second period. He
added insult to injury by passing
for the extra point after the third
score.

The

No Offense

Besides not being able to stop
the other team's passes, the Pan-
thers could not fashion an offens
of their own. They plodded along
in the first half, content to crack
at the solid Buckeye line and get
nowhere.

Ohio State only had the best
rushing defensive team in the nation
Saturday. Pitt didn’t make a first

Quarterback Bob Bestwick didn't
open up and start passing until the
second half when they were hope-
lessly out of the game. Bestwick
threw a 13-yard pass to Sophomore
George Glagola for their only score
with a minute left in the game.

Most of the Panther Jayvees

Saturday’s 0SU Game

Was Lost in ’47

By MY RON KOPELMAN

Sports Editor

COI_Ih‘lBl7S, O. -- The menu for Pitt football fans this week
will, of course, feature fried Casanova. Well done on a high fire,

naturally.

But don’t buy it. It isn’t kosher.

It isn’t kosher because Satur-
day’s Ohio State game was, in
reality, lost ’way back in 1947.
And Coach Len Casanova was not
around these parts then.
Experience Locking _

Why 1947? Well, there is now
front line senior bacl<--
 field man on the
Pitt team, which
proves that the
recruiting of high
school backs
three years ago
must have been
_7 pathetic. Had
I some good backs
been gotten at
that time, they
would now be

providing expe-
_ rienced material,
which Casanova so desperately
needs if he is to field a winning
team.

In both the Duke and Ohio State
games, the Panthers’ collapse
started as soon as the green ‘pass
defenders revealed themselves to
be frantically helpless against
enemy aerials. Such a state of
confusion undoubtedly demoralized
the linemen, the result being a
total el foldo.

Now then, it was in the spring of
1947 that Mike Milligan took over
the head Coaching job from the
personable Wesley Fesler, who

(10! 8.

   
   

Milligan

     
 
 
 
 
  
  
 

had resigned to accept a spot at
Ohio State. Fesler, the charm boy,
had previously been successful
in wooing a few backs despite
the terrific competition from
southern and Big Ten scouts.

But Milligan, never a silver-
tongued gusher, apparently could
not pick up swiftly where Fesler
left off in the recruitment battle.
Effects Upon Us

Maybe he was concentrating less
the glamorous, much-sought
I   backfielders than
f on the high
‘school linemen.
-Or maybe his of-
fers were too
:puny next to
‘competing ones.
_ r ‘maybe he
-;wasn’t suffi-
iently tactful
and effusive.

OI]

  

Q ‘t.
Casanova

Whatever the case, Milligan was
not getting the backs. In later
years as he warmed up to his job,
Mike and his right hand man,
josh Williams, improved upon the
situation. But 1947 had already
gone down as a lean recruitment
year, in the matter of backs, and
the effects of that year are only
now upon us.

And Casanova
the rap.

Yogi Berra of the New York
Yankees was swinging and con-

missing with amazing ease.

the swamis, as Stan Skirboll
started his comeback by only

"I saw the Dukegame last week,”
he stated, “and I saw this coming.
Pitt absolutely has no pass de-
fense, and Ohio State just capital-
ized on it.

"Pitt still has a top line, but
they’re sadly lacking a pass defense
and a fullback,” the grid authority
continued. “And remember, this
is Columbus, that's Fesler out
there, and the Buckeyes lost last
week. That’s a‘"'2hard combination
to beat.”

* * *

The Columbus Evening Dis-
patch on the morning before the
game, said, “This year, the ex-
pected crowd of 75,000 will be
mighty surprised if the 41-0
score of 1948 isn't repeated.

Give that man a turban and
call him a yogi.

MC Book Store es
Cash to Forgetful 145

The Men’s Council Book Store owes money to 145 Pitt stu-

dents.

And the worst of it is, the 145 men and women seem to have

forgotten a bout it.

This long-neglected wealth was_upturned by Bookstore Mana-
ger Ronnie Ecker as he pored ox‘/‘er accounts for the thriving used

book store on the eighth floor pre-
paratory to closing it on Friday.

The money is piling up in the
form of checks which were drafted
to pay students for the used books
which they sold to the store in form-

er years. The students are not payed,

for the book until the book is sold
by the store. In the interim the “for-
getful 145" apparently just "plain
forgot.”
