SGB plans
to inquire
about new
block meal
system

By Kevin Kramer
For The Pitt News

Student Government
Board President Ross
Pasquale and other
board members
discussed problems
with Pitt’s newest meal
plan at its first meeting
of the semester last
night. -

The block plan,
which is mandatory for
all students who live
on campus, is not opti-
mal for many upper-
class students who

have used Choice
Dollars, according to
Pasquale.

“In the past, upper-
class students were
allowed tohave only
Choice Dollars,”
Pasquale said.

“When they would
buy something it
would only take off
that amount. Now, if
they go to breakfast
with the block plan
and only spend one
dollar, they are getting
three dollars taken
off.”

Pasquale said he
feels a disparity in
the amounts of

money. that are being
used, which is _why
he decided to talk to
Pitt’s food services
office about the prob-
lem.

In addition to meet-
ing with Pitt’s food
services, Pasquale
and other board mem-
bers said they met with
the recently appointed
Leon Haley, vice
chancellor for student
and public affairs,

SGB picks student as the president for a day

By Kevin Kramer
and David Saliba
For The Pitt News

The lottery winner on
Sept. 20 will not be awarded
cash or a new car, but
instead will become the
University of Pittsburgh
Student Government Board

president for a day.

Asa way to involve stu-
dents with governmental
procedures, SGB President
Ross Pasquale will provide
a Pitt student with an
opportunity to unveil their
leadership qualities.

“The purpose [of the pro-
ject] is to allow at least one

student to see how things are

run in this office,” Pasquale

said.

‘.‘[Our goal] is to try to
get students involved and
to show just how diffi-
cult it is to do something
in a very short time,” said
President Pro-Tempore
Elizabeth Mania.

Though one day may
seem too short to make
substantial gains, Pasquale
said he believes otherwise.

“It depends on what
their goals are,” Pasquale
said. “I’ve seen board
members make phone
calls and get things done.”

WASHINGTON —
Preparing for a possible inva-
sion of Haiti, the USS
Eisenhower was expected to
arrive in Norfolk, Va., yesterday
to load troops and equipment.

The Eisenhower is being
readied to serve mainly as a
platform for helicopters in the
impending invasion to restore
ousted president Jean—Bertrand-
Aristide.

On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher
warned the island nation that an
invasion was imminent.

“I hope they leave. I hope
they leave very promptly, but
their days are numbered and
they will leave one way or
another, either soft or hard.” —-

BERLIN — German police
intercepted 30 ounces of
radioactive material being
smuggled from Moscow to
Berlin by plane.

Police found the material —
believed by authorities to be
uranium ore — in the luggage
of a Zairean man, packed next
to some food.

Officials said the material
seized can not be used to make
a bomb, unlike the plutonium-
237 and enriched uranium
they’ve confiscated in four

seizures since May. —— Reuters

BERLIN — North Korea
reported Monday that progress
has been made in talks with the
United States regarding the
Koreans’ nuclear capabilities.

The talks between the two
countries have focused on North
Korea switching its nuclear
technology to a variety which

would make it almost impossi— y

ble to produce nuclear weapons.

Along with discussing the
change, North Korea has hinted
it would rather use a German
reactor than one from South
Korea, which insists its equip-
ment be part of any deal
between the two countries. -

WASHINGTON —-— The
U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency has found that dioxin, a
class of chemical compounds
used in herbicides and found in
fish and other foods, probably
causes cancer, The Washington
Post reported Monday.

In a 2,000 page report made
public Monday, the EPA will
stop just short of labeling dioxin
a carcinogen because that would
necessitate further studies.

The study estimates dioxin

and related compounds are

responsible for between one in
1,000 and one in 10,000 of all

cancers, including lung cancer.

Pitt donates its services
to Flight 427 aftermath

By Stephen Kozarovich
News Editor

Over 2,000 people gath-
ered in downtown
yester-

service for the 132 victims of
USAir Flight 427.

Pitt’s ties to the Thursday
tragedy in Hopewell
Township were also
mournful because of the loss
of members of the Pitt fami-
l .
yBut Pitt was able to lend a
helping hand in the after-
math.

Thursday night, a team of
eight people of the
Greater Pittsburgh Critical
Incidents Stress Debriefing
Team were at the scene of
the crash to provide stress
management to other rescue
officials on the scene,
according to Lisa Rossi, a

University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

“Their role is not to rescue
victims,” Rossi said, “their
role is  to provide emotion-
al counseling to those on the
front line.’’

Stress management pro-

grams serve to help
psychologically healthy peo-
ple deal with normal
responses to abnormal
situations, according to
Rossi.

The CISD team consists
of volunteers from all
over Allegheny County,
and they are coordinated
through the UPMC, Rossi
said. This group of volun-

teers included a local
police officer and sever-
al health care profes-
sionals. ~

At the scene, the CISD
team checked on the well-

Rush events 0 chance to mingle

By Erica Glasspool
For The Pitt News

Meeting 700 people in one week seems
pretty impossible to anyone unless that week
is Greek Rush Week.

“Rushing is a great way to meet people. It’s
exciting and fun. It helps freshman or trans-
fer students find their niche. It helps establish
a focus and provide a mentor,” said Kerry
Daley, assistant director of student activities
and Greek advisor.

Even though sororities are controlled by
the Panhellenic Association and fraternities
are controlled by the Interfraternity Council
the objective of Rush Week is the same -
recruitment.

Rush Week happens twice a year at
the beginning of each semester. This
semester, Rush Week for the IFC started
Sept. 7 and ends Sept. 14, while Panhel’s
rush starts Sept. 16 and runs through Sept.
21.

and the Towers’ lobby are set up for stu-
dents to register. While registration for frater-
nities is free of charge, sororities have a $15
fee to help cover the costs of events for the
week

Sororities are governed nationally, includ-
ing all events for each chapter and rush week
itself.

“[Sorority] rush is very mechanical. It
helps provide guidelines and a system of fair-
ness for all sororities participating,” said
Daley.

While sorority rush is more structured,
fraternity rush is more individualized.
The three rules all fraternities must fol-
low for rush are that there can be no

alcohol at any event, that a member
of the IFC must monitor each event and
that every event must be announced pub-
licly.

Rushees for sororities who are
registered by Sept. 13 are invited to pre-

GPSA '

-Frompagel

According to Thompson, starting this
fall if a graduate student wants to
attend a PPC— sponsored event with
the student discount, then they must
fill out a voucher. PPC will then send
the voucher to GPSA who will pay
the difference.

In addition to the voucher system,
the GPSA is working with PAT
buses to form a graduate student
discount because most graduate
students live off—campus and use the
bus frequently, Thompson said.

In other business, Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor opened the meeting
by passing out a packet concerning this
year’s freshman class.

“Nineteen percent of the freshman
class were in the top 10 ‘percent of
their high school class,” O’Connor
said. “The combined SAT score was
902 [and] that put us above the
Pennsylvania average and the national
average.”

James Holland, senate president,
spoke about the new food

court, Eddie’s, opening at Towers cafe-

teria.

“Eddie’s is in the space where one
of the cafeterias used to be in Towers.
It is very nicely designed," Holland
said.

Holland said one of the advantages of
the food court is its safe location.

“Late at night if you need a snack,
you can go to Eddie’s instead of
going out on Forbes Avenue,” Holland
said.

The Senate Council Staff Association
President Darlene Harris reported about
the success of the Day of Caring, a city-
wide event held Sept. 1.

“Approximately 220 volunteers par-
ticipated in a Day of Caring. It was
hard work but it was very rewarding,”
Harris said.

Harris added that in the future they
will try to have a Day of Caring that
is not on the second day of classes,
and she also said they would like
to get more people involved.

“We’d like to encourage more student
involvement in the future,” said Harris.

Also discussed at yesterday’s Senate
Council meeting:
°O’Connor announced a committee is
being formed to replace retiring Vice
Chancellor for Health Sciences Thomas
Detre.
°O’Connor welcomed Rick Boyd, new
public safety director to the university.
°O’Connor said he will try to get the
U.S. Advisory Council to hold a meet-
ing at Pitt in 1995.
°Holland said the Dental School
Survey was completed over the summer
and all results will be in by Sept. 16.
°Student Government Board
announced they are sponsoring a self-
defense seminar on Sept. 28, at 8:30
p.m. in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom. They encouraged all students
to attend.
°SGB President Ross Pasquale said
plans are being made to have a
“President for a day contest,” sponsored
by SGB. *
°Holland said the Scientific Integrity
Policy and the Post Tenure Review
Subcommittee are in place.

wrestling and the joust.

“It’s an original idea and
something fun for the stu-
dents,” said freshman Josh
Hubert.

Freshman Eric Milmaster
agreed and called the
Campus Fest “wild.”

Numerous events includ-
ed games such as a
joust, basketball, a bat-
ting cage, an obstacle
course and a bungee
run in which students
running against one
another struggled to run
as quickly as possible
from one end of the event to
the other while
strapped to a bungee cord.

For those students
who preferred to test
their intellectual
abilities rather than
their physical ones,
the game Totally Tunes
Trivia offered prizes
while stimulating the
mind with such questions
as “What was Motown’s
biggest selling group?” and

“Who is the lead guitarist
of the Red Hot Chili
Peppers?”

The Sports Illustrated-
sponsored event also offered
students the chance to relax
and enjoy themselves.

“It’s better than sitting in
the cathedral,” Pitt student
Adam Scherzer.

Campus Fest not only
encouraged students to relax
and enjoy the day with
their friends, it also had
plenty of displays adver-
tising
Gatorade, Right Guard,
American Express, and
Toyota to name a few.

Students had the
tunity to enter a number of
contests to test their luck in
winning prizes ranging from
free T—shirts and squeeze
bottles to the ultimate dorm
room and a Kawasaki jet
ski. I

Campus Fest also offered
students free food , includ-
ing fortune cookies,
chocolate candy bars and
free cups of Gatorade. While
there were plenty of fun
things for students to win
or to buy, there were also
items such as Computers
and think pads on display.

“It’s cool for the students,
and very ‘convenient rather
than carrying V a computer
with you,” said salesman
Jonathan Carvell.

Campus Fest is an escape
for students who are begin-
ning to feel the pressures of
the new school year. Simply
put by junior Kenny Bell,
“I’m having fun.”

The Festwill run today
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

separated themselves from
their sororities to participate

For the first two nights,
rushees go through an
event called 12 rounds.
Each night they visit six
different houses or suites
and meet the different chap-
ters.

On the third night, rushees
must cut four houses from
their rounds and visit only
eight. The next night four
more are cut.

Tuesday is preference

To promote fairness

of 65 sisters per chap-

“We talked to him about
the future of student affairs,

SGB also discussed their
revising of the . elections
code for student govem-
ment. Though the
code is changed every
three years, chair of SGB’s
Elections Committee
Heather Heinrichs said she
felt the previous code was
.somewhat unfair.

“There was potential
for . one candidate to
end up with a lot more
funds at their exposal for
the elections,” Heinrichs
said. “This just evens it all
out.”

Another topic brought
up at the meeting was
student safety and self-

Lower the volume

The Sports Illustrated Campus Fest ran yesterday and
today. Free food, free sports activities and prizes have been
advertised. But that’s not all Campus Fest brings to Pitt — it
also disrupts classes. Part of the extravaganza is some annoy-
ing creature with a loud microphone blathering about all the
“way cool” prizes we lucky students can win. Of course if
you are a student who has the audacity to attend class rather
than beat someone’s brains out with a pugil stick, you may
have heard all the noise while trying to listen to your profes-
sor. The microphone dude could be heard even up on the 35th
floor of the Cathedral of Learning, where windows were
closed so a student could give a report.

Pitt is an urban campus which means plenty of outside
noise. Furthermore, many of the classrooms (especially in the
cathedral) have rather bad acoustics. The last thing this cam-
pus needs is more noise, especially from a university spon-
sored event!

We are not saying that events like Campus Fest should
not be brought to Pitt, but is it really necessary to have
someone on a microphone shouting about prizes, let alone at
a volume loud enough to reach the 35th ﬂoor of the cathe-
dral?

This is not an isolated event either. There were a number of
events last year which deafened students in cathedral class-
rooms. Pitt’s administration should remember that this is an
academic institution not a social organization. It is not hard to
organize fun campus events without the excessive decibel lev-
els. In the future it would be wise to use some forethought
and test the noise level before running similar events.

Holland is right

Pitt Faculty Assembly President James Holland questioned
on Thursday and again yesterday Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s decision to align the departments of student and
public affairs. The Pitt News joins Holland in questioning
Chancellor O’Connor’s latest move.

‘First of all O’Connor did not consult any of the university’s
governance groups before making this controversial decision.
Pitt is not a dictatorship. '

Holland is right when he complains of the “lack of input and
lack opportunity of advice from elected faculty groups and
student groups.” A

Furthermore, we have to question the decision itself. It
seems to us that there is a fundamental difference, and perhaps
conﬂict, between student and public affairs.

For O’Connor to so cavalierly make a decision that i
so affects the student body, without at least consulting V

those groups who would have a vested interest in the decision,
is of doubtful intelligence. The least O’Connor could do is to
justify his decision to the university body; however he has
merely met Holland’s criticisms with silence — at least pub-
licly.

Religious rights threaten GOP success

F f e w
weeks
ago, I

ran across a
Post-Gazette
cartoon by
Rob Rogers
which depict-
ed President

Columnist Clinton writ-
Rlck . ing this note:
NOWlln “Dear right- ‘

wing regime:

“The people of your country
have selected a president.
May I remind you that you
lost the election? Back off
before I really get mad!

“Signed, Bill Clinton”

An aide asked, “Haiti?”

“No,” the president
responded, “the GOP.”

It is no secret that the con-
servative wing of the
Republican Party is out for
blood and will stop at nothing
to get it. The playing up of the
Clintons’ financial dealings
and the Paula Corbin Jones
case have only whetted con-
servatives’ appetite for fried
Bill and Hillary. ,

Here’s one prediction: They
won’t get it, and Clinton
will be re-elected in 1996,
should he run. I say this for
one simple reason -by that
time, the Republicans will be
hopelessly divided between
the power-hungry conserva-
tives and the traditionalist
moderates, and what the con-
servatives don’t seem to
understand is that the moder-
ates are still in the majority.
(For example, the GOP plat-
form since 1980 has opposed
abortion, while about two-
thirds of registered
Republicans support abortion
rights.) If the Democrats play
their cards right, the GOP
right-wing takeover will be
the best thing that’s happened
to them since FDR.

That fissure became public
during the 1992 convention in
Houston, when television
commentator and presidential
candidate Pat Buchanan and
Christian television personali-
ty Pat Robertson delivered
speeches trashing just about

,I'I1CI'

everyone in sight that didn’t
agree with their agenda; Some
say that those speeches cost
George Bush the election.
One of those people was for-
Vice—President Dan
Quayle, no moderate, whom
Buchanan attacked in a col-
umn in May. Now, if the con-
servatives can’t agree among

themselves, what makes any- .

one think that they can get
along with anyone else?

The conservatives have also
caused controversy on the

‘state level. Around 20 GOP

state committees have been
taken over by Robertson’s
Christian Coalition; that
group has flexed enough mus-
cle to wrest the GOP nomina-
tion away from a sitting gov-
ernor in Minnesota! They sup-
port convicted Iran-Contra
figure Oliver North in his bid
for the United States Senate
—— and as a result, a whole lot
of moderate Republicans are
now supporting Democratic
incumbent Chuck Robb or
independent Marshall
Coleman. ‘Even in
Pennsylvania, Johnstown con-
servative activist, Marguerite
“Peg” Luksik, who nearly
won the GOP nomination for
governor four years ago, is
considering running as an
independent, for the simple
reason that the endorsed can-
didates, Mark Singel and Tom
Ridge aren’t sufficiently con-
servative. Most experts
believe that she will hand
Singel the election.

There are two things that
need to be taken into account.
First, the GOP right has yet to
understand that the only
reason it won the presidency
in 1980 and ‘84 was
that snake-oil salesman named
Ronald Wilson Reagan. It
was not because of supply-
side economics, abortion,
“traditional values” or any
of that stuff that they say
that Americans want these
days (in fact, they really
couldn’t care less). Bush, run-
ning on a similar platform,
probably would have lost in
‘88 to a stronger candidate,

and he did lose in ‘92._
(Interestingly, Buchanan said
that, after the GOP conven-
tion, they were gaining on
Clinton before Clinton’s
attacks on them. I wonder if
he remembers that in previous
years they were comfortably
ahead.)

The other consideration is
that political parties are not in
the business of taking moral
stances for its own sake - their
main objective is to win elec-
tions. The Democrats learned
that the hard way during the
l980’s, with Jesse Jackson’s
stirring but often frightening
speeches possibly costing
them votes, so then-DNC
chairman Ron Brown muzzled
Jackson and reached out to
the so-called “Reagan
Democrats” during the 1992
campaign. Now, black leaders
castigated the Democratic
Party for doing that initially,
but a shocked Charles Range],
a black Congressman from
New York City, admitted dur-
ing the campaign, “The
damned strategy’s working.”
The Democrats had, in the
public’s eye, gone too far to
the left and corrected itself. In
the same way, the
Republicans are possibly
going too far to the right.

If the GOP right thinks it
can win elections by simply
pandering to the so-called
“family values” crowd, it’s
got a big, unpleasant surprise
coming. Already some moder-
ates are calling for the ouster
of the conservatives. The
patriarch of the hard right,
Barry Goldwater, is on record
saying that someone “should
kick [Jerry Falwell] in the
ass,” and locally, Elsie
Hillman actually targeted a
number of right-wingers run-
ning for the state committee
for defeat. The conservatives
might not like it, but she feels
she did the party some good
by trying to limit their inﬂu-
ence. She may eventually be
proven right.

Marino air it

a blitzing Rickey Jackson and
listened to a crowd that boast-

echoed “Green” on the other.

Marino and company
jumped out to an early 14-

shot at the national title.

Years later, that same kid
snuck into the student section

who had an extra ID, for the
1989‘ Penn State game. Late in
the contest Pitt’s Adam Walker
had his touchdown run called
back thanks A to a holding

16-13.

Of all the teams the Panthers

games. Penn State is missing
from the schedule.

This, of course, is not a
news ﬂash to anyone who fol-
lows either team. The discon-
tinuation of the rivalry last
year was highly publicized and
hotly debated.

The decision to break the
string of games, which lasted
58 years dating back to 1934,
occurred when Penn State
joined the Big Ten and just did
not have enough space on the
schedule to keep Pitt on it.
PSU still plays West Virginia,
by the way.

When the break in play was
announced, many speculated
that coach Joe Paterno was
punishing Pitt for joining the
Big East Conference in basket-
ball in the early 1980s.

Regardless, those who are
being punished now are the
fans.

For 58 years, Penn State was
the traditional end-of-the-sea-
son reward for Pitt fans. This
season, Pitt winds up the year
with the likes of Temple and
Rutgers. The Panthers do have
Miami sandwiched between
those two juggernauts as an
attractive draw, but one can

Saturday

By David Saliba

Two of the biggest names in
football for the University of
Pittsburgh might not be in the
lineup this Saturday at Ohio
Stadium when the Panthers
take on thel8th-ranked Ohio
State Buckeyes.

All-American candidates
Curtis Martin and Reuben
Brown are both bothered by
injuries that could keep them
out of Saturday’s nationally
televised game (ESPN).

On the last play of the first
quarter against Ohio U. last
Saturday, Martin injured his
ankle while throwing a block.
He left the game and did not
return.

“It’s a very bad looking

Olnjuries, page I 7

still, and I usually can’t now.”

But there was a valuable les-
son that Thornton leamed from
her accident. And the lesson
would prove vital for her in
years to come.

“I learned to deal with pain
since a young age, because that
was pretty traumatic,”
Thornton said. “I think I deal
with pain pretty well now.”

Priding oneself in having a
high threshold of pain usually
is not on the top of /one’s
attribute list, but for Thornton
it would be something she
would have to get used to.

In her sophomore year in
high school, she injured her
anterior cruciate ligament in
her right knee while skiing.
And when she came to Pitt as a

freshman, she was redshirted,

because she needed reconstruc-
tive surgery on the same knee.

Thornton played three years
after her surgery without hav-
ing any seriousiknee problems,
until she had minor arthroscop-
ic surgery before the start of
this season, again, on the same
knee.

After two surgeries, most
people would call it quits, but
not Thornton. The drive to
play volleyball was too strong
to hold her back.

“She has had to deal a lot
with her knee,” her teammate
and friend Annemarie
Mernagh said. “But you can
tell how bad she wants to be
out there just by talking to her.
She’s never been pain-free.”

“I don’t think injuries get in
the way too much,” Thornton,
a fifth-year senior, said. “I put

Men's Cross Country wins despite Nesko's absence

Women
fall at Kent

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

Talent and ability helped the
University of Pittsburgh men’s
cross country team defeat Kent
State University while inexpe-
rience and youth contributed to
the loss for the Panther
women.

“[The men] won under a lot

of adversity,” Pitt distance
coach Mark Schwartz said.
“Frank Nesko was missing,
Matt Clarkson was missing,

Dennis Kuntz rose to the occa-

sion and secured the victory.
“They ran like seniors,”
Schwartz said. “[Umb1eby] is

mate Dennis Kuntz.

“Dennis is finding out how
good he is,” Schwartz said.
“This is the best shape and

“We played at Kent’s level. We won and I’m glad, but we need

to perform better mentally.”

they didn’t even start the
race.”

Even though two of the top
runners for the men’s team
were unable to participate, ath-
letes like Mike Umbleby and

the best guy coming back
[from last year], he is one of
our main men.”

Finishing in first with a time
of 26:14, Umbleby was only
19 seconds faster than team-

preparation that he has ever
been in.”

Following Kuntz in fourth
place was Ed Adamson who
finished with a time of 26:44.

whole, Schwartz is glad they
won but feels they did not ful-
fill their potential.

“We played at Kent’s level,”
Schwartz said. “We won and
I’m glad, but we need to per-
form better mentally.”

Mental toughness was not
the issue for the women, rather
it was youth and inexperience.

“The women are young,”
Schwartz said. “Kent had all
juniors and seniors.”

Leading the women was
sophomore Angie Martin who
finished second overall with a
time of 19:46.

“She’s a leader,” Schwartz
said. “Angie went out very
fast, and in the end shegwas
challenged but didn’t accept
that.”

Martin turned out to be the
only bright spot in an other-
wise dismal finish.

Yet Schwartz will quickly
add that inexperience is a
major reason for the position
of the women’s finish. .

“They have done better at
this point than last year,”
Schwartz said. “We have a lot
of freshmen who will gain
experience with time.”

Stacey ‘Anderson, a fresh-
man, has the potential but
seemed overwhelmed by
Division I cross-country,”
Schwartz said.

“She looked around as if to
say, ‘This is Division I?,” said
Schwartz. “Stacy will
improve, she gave us a lot.”

According to Schwartz the
women’s team needs to run
more intelligently and respond
to challenges.

“Mental toughness is a key,”
Schwartz said. “That is some-
thing we need to improve

Thornton

°From page 11
season, Thornton is dominat-
ing the Panthers in almost
every offensive category.

Thornton has 93 kills, 44
more than Sara Mitchell, who
is second on the team. She has
the best hitting percentage with
.216, the most kills per game
(4.0) and the most digs (77)
and digs per game.

“I just want to go out with a
bang,” Thornton said. “I want
to do good this season.”

The reason for Thornton’s
inﬂated stats this season is her
move from the right side of the
line to ‘the more offensively
active left side.

“Carrie has come so far in
volleyball the past two years,”
Mernagh said. “She’s really
become a tremendous player,
and she’s a tremendous per-
son.”

“She has great skills,” head
coach Cindy Alvear said. “Her
arm swing is the best on the
team and one of the best
around.”

ﬁfth this year.

She led Norwin High School
in North Huntingdon, Pa., to
the 1987 WPIAL and PIAA
championships and was named

for team captain.

“It’s good being the team

easy for people to come talk to

attitude,” she said. “I can make
people laugh. I’m always goof-

and would rather talk about her

on the team’s well-being are

any situation seem light,”
Mernagh said. “She always
puts things into perspective.
She’s upbeat and no one can
affect her mood. On the court
she always knows what to
say.” 5

Thomton’s experience made
her a perfect choice for cap-
tain.

“I was honored that my
teammates voted me captain,”
Thornton said. “That makes
me feel great.”

Although Thornton is

friends and I when I was little
used to get together after
school and play school. I know
it’s ridiculous.”

Thornton has already
received her degree in sociolo-
gy. She is currently in the grad-
uate school of education and is
hopeful that she will teach in
the ﬁeld of social studies.

“She has always been acade-
mically solid,” Alvear said.
“She is more together person-
ally than most 22—year—olds her
age.”

Although Thornton says her
chronically-injured right knee
is OK, and she is well on her
way in her career, she’ can not
shake her nemesis ~—— the auto-
mobile.

Since Thornton was hit by a
car when she was little, she has
been plagued by cars. Just last
Wednesday her mom was hit
by a drunk driver as she was
coming home after watching
Thornton play against
Stanford. Thornton said her
mother is doing “OK.”

Recently, Thornton bought a
car, and a week later she was a
victim of a hit-and—run. Only a
week later she hit someone
else’s car, and it is difficult to
believe that but a month after
that she was a hit—and—run vic-
tim again.

“I have three dents in my car,
and it’s not even a year old,”
Thornton said.

“I guess I don’t have much
luck.’’

She does not, at least when .

it comes to injuries either to
herself or her car.

hardly consider it, in any way,
a rival game.

The lone true rival left on
the schedule is West Virginia,
but that game has characteris-
tically been played early in the
year, still leaving a lack for an
season-ending thriller.

The Pitt-Penn State rivalry
has been among the most sto-
ried in college football. The
two schools do not meet this
season. They missed each
other last year. In fact, Pitt and
Penn State do not plan on fac-
ing off again until 1997.

To this day Pitt students
habitually chant “P-E—N-N S-
T sucks” at every opportunity
no matter who the opponent,
despite the fact that the large
majority of students have
never seen a live Penn State

football game at Pitt Stadium.
Current seniors were freshmen
in 1991, when the Nittany
Lions last visited Oakland.

H.-nnlilam

Yet the fans may not be the
area hardest hit by the Pitt-
Penn State lockout. Both
schools used the contest as a
valuable recruiting resource.
The Nittany Lions, loaded
with talent and arguably one
of the top freshmen classes
again this season, has hardly
been affected in this respect.

Pitt on the other hand, in the
midst of a massive rebuilding
project, certainly has been.

Kids, particularly in talent-
rich Western Pennsylvania,
grow up dreaming of playi_ng
in rival-doused games like Pitt
and Penn State. Nobody grows
up dreaming of playing in Pitt-
Temple games. .

Since shifting to the Big 10,
Penn State has begun what
naturally will become rival-
ries, if only for the clashing of
mighty programs, with teams
like Ohio State and Michigan.

Pitt has lost its chief rival
and a top recruiting tool.
Despite the state of the pro-
gram in recent years, far infe-
rior to that of Penn State, Pitt
has desperately missed a
matchup that holds the pub-
1ic’s eye no matter the talent
level of the participants.

The Panthers have quietly
suffered, more so than the Joe
Pa crew, from the Pitt-Penn
State strike.

thing on film,” head coach Johnny
Majors said.

“He was very lucky to walk off the
field.”

For the most hailed running
back since Hall of Fame great Tony
Dorsett, Martin has amassed quite
an impressive statistic sheet for
less than two games this year. In
the opener against the Texas
Longhorns, Martin ran for 251 yards
on 28 carries. .

Before his departure at the end of the
first quarter against Ohio University,
Martin was able to gain 31 yards on 8
carries. .

Martin is currently ranked first in the
Big East in rushing with a 141 yards
per game average. ,

Much of Martin’s success is due,
in part, to Brown, a left tackle,
who missed last week’s victory against
Ohio University due to a wrist in-
jury. -

“We had some of our fine football
players sitting on the bench for that
game,” Majors said.

Brown’s injury dates back to

Wednesday’s practice prior to the
Ohio University game. He left prac-
tice early that day and has yet to re-
turn.

The loss of Brown and Martin’s early
exit in last Saturday’s game did not
hinder the performance of the Pan-
thers as they routed, the Bobcats 30-
16.

The talent that is lost in Martin
and Brown’s absence will be des-
perately needed against the Buck-
eyes.

“We are concerned about two play-
ers, Curtis Martin and Reuben Brown,”
Majors said.

Martin and Brown are both listed as
questionable for the game against Ohio
State.

“We will not know about Curtis

until he has X-rays [yesterday]

on his ankle. And we will not
know about Reuben Brown until, at
the earliest, Wednesday,” Majors
said.

Additionally, Pitt wide receiver
Curtis Anderson and linebacker Gerald
Simpson are both doubtful for the Ohio
State game.

receiver Chris Carter, who is
now one of the top receivers in
the NFL. He finished the season
with 13 total touchdowns.

The 5-feet—1l-inch receiver’s
season was culminatedagainst
no other than Pitt when he
scored three touchdowns. ‘

The amazing thing about
Galloway’s speed is that he tore
his anterior cruciate ligament in
his right knee as a sophomore,

an injury that some athletes,

and speed was one of the main
reasons why he earned‘ All—Big
Ten honors and was a third team
All-American. He collected 46
receptions for 946 yards, an
average of 20.1 yards every

receive, but he also assumes the
kickoff and punt return respon-
sibilities, as well as lining up at
running back once in a while.
Before his suspension, in the
first game of the season against
Fresno State, Galloway showed

why he is rated as one of the top
receivers in the country. He
amassed 152 all-purpose yards
and scored two touchdowns.

. Galloway’s suspension is the
second break Pitt has received
this season.

In Pitt’s home opener against
the Texas Longhorns, both of
Texas’ starting receivers, Mike
Adams and Lovell Pinkney
were suspended. That receiving
tandem was labeled as the best
duo in the country, and Adams
was an All-American candidate.

The receivers were suspended
after breaking an NCAA ama-
