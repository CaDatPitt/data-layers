Pitt senior Fred Sinkevitch,
who says he is one-quarter Lakota
Indian, is . trying to amend the
University's smoke‘-free dorm poli-
cy. And not just to be a rebel.

His actions stem from a
February 1996 incident in which he
was caught burning incense in his
Tower A dorm room as part of a
Lakota ritual known as "smudging."

Smudging involves burning a
handful of sage, cedar chips and
tobacco in a small clay bowl.

"The University's rule is inef-
fective," said Sinkevitch. "Students
smoke in their dorm rooms. They
burn candles and incense -all the
time, and they don't catch many stu-
dents. Maybe, if they're lucky,
they'll catch one in 10."

Student group at Pitt helps
save college financial aid

The main problem with obtaining
the funding was that the House and
Senate could not agree on a bill. The
House's version would have given $532
million more to the Pell Grant than does
the current Senate bill, and the Senate's
proposal would have provided $35 mil-
lion to the SSIG but eliminated the Pell

- Grant.

This paradox is what the USSA was

working to resolve. Pitt was the only

Students across the country can
now breathe a sigh of relief and thank a
group of Pitt students for saving their
financial aid.

After nearly two months of deliber-
ations by the U.S. House and Senate
over ﬁnancial aid for college students,
the federal government has guaranteed

$25 million to fund the State Student
Incentive Grant and $452 million to
fund the Pell Grant. Both programs
were in danger of losing their funding.

The decision was made after inces-
sant lobbying by the Government
Relations Committee, a group of stu-
dents who work under the United States
Students Association. The USSA's goal
is to give everyone the chance to attend
college, regardless of their race, ethnic
origin or ﬁnancial status.

The congressional deliberations
seemed to take a long time for "some—

school in the country whose branch of
the USSA mobilized to push the House
and Senate to decide, according to Flora
Sweeney, chair of the Student
Government Board's GRC.

‘Commenting on the GRC's efforts,
Spitzer noted, "It's been really exciting
around campus."

The GRC's hours of lobbying,
research, and gathering and sending
nearly 1,200 signatures to members of
Congress have paid off so far, although
the ultimate goal is $63 million in fund-
ing for the SSIG and up to a maximum
of $3,300 in funding per student for the
Pell Grant.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and

considering suing the University,
alleging ‘a violation of his right to

According to Marsha Bol,
associate curator for the Carnegie
Museum of Natural History, sage is
considered to be a sacred plant by
many Native Americans. It is
burned for puriﬁcation purposes
and is common in many cere-
monies, such as the Sun Dance.

Attorneys at the Pittsburgh
chapter of the ACLU say that
because Sinkevitch is smudging for
religious purposes, the University
may be violating his religious free-
dom. He doesn't want to sue the
University, but he hasn't ruled it out.

Fred Sinkevich publicly fought to pro-
tect his religious freedoms with a "smudge
in" Friday afternoon on the Fifth Avenue
side of the William Pitt Union.

Sinkevich, a Native American Pitt
senior, was protesting the University's posi-
tion on the religious ceremony he wishes to
conduct in his Forbes Hall dorm room The
ceremony, called smudging, requires
Sinkevich to burn sacred herbs in a small
pot. The smoke ﬁem these herbs is said to
purify the area in which they are bumed,
thereby making the area suitable for prayer.

The University maintains that smudg-
ing violates the residence hall's no smoking
policy and presents a ﬁre hazard

Sinkevich, who has been ﬁghting the
policy for three years, decided to inform the
student body of his ﬁght on Friday by
smudging publicly and handing out ﬂyers
explaining his ritual and the University's
reaction to it.

Sinkevich was joined by three fellow
Native American Students Organization
members, who helped him hand out 350 ﬂy-

"I don't think it's right that they [the

University] won't let him do a smudging cer-
emony in his room, so I'm supporting," said
Dupree.
Natalie Paull, a sophomore who is
NASO vice president and who participated
in the demonstration, believes that the
University's stand on smudging is ﬂawed,
due to the nature of the ceremony itself.

"The problem is there is no other place
you can smudge except at home. It is
designed to be done in the home," Paul] said.

Freshman Donald Gram took part in the
demonstration in the name of religious free-
dom.

"I'm not religious, but I believe we
should have the freedom of religion," he
said. "It's in the Constitution in the Bill of
Rights."

At the close of the demonstration, Paull
said the students were responsive to the
information that the demonstrators offered

"Generally, people we have approached
with ﬂyers have taken them," said Paull.
"Some people even came over to ask us
questions."

Sinkevich agreed, and he told many stu-
dents how they could support his freedom to

Across the Nation

NEW YORK — Pop star Janet Jackson
says she's emerging from a two-year bout
with depression that was so bad she
resorted to coffee enemas.

Jackson tells Newsweek it took six

‘ months to record her latest album, The

Velvet Rope, because she'd cry in the stu-

' die and have to quit for the day.

Jackson also says she used the ene-
mas to cleanse her system of "sad cells."

Jackson says her depression stems
from her childhood. She recounted one
incident in which a white teacher made
her feel stupid because she couldn't ﬁgure
out a math problem.

Jackson scored big with her albums
Control and Rhythm Nation. Her hits
include "What Have You Done for Me
Lately," "When I Think of You," and
"Let's Wait Awhile."

decries the fact that Nike has no U.S.

Sanders says members of Congress

through a bong can decrease its harmful
eﬁ°ects.

The ﬁve were -held for trial by

Around t_he World

LONDON — Scientists reportedly have
come up with a way to allow women to
put off menopause indeﬁnitely and
remain fertile, into old age. .

The London Sunday Times says
Harvard University researchers were
looking into ways to preserve fertility in
cancer patients. The paper says the scien-
tists found a way of stopping ovaries from
dying. I

The research is still at the experimen-
talstage. But the Sunday Times quotes
the lead researcher as saying the results
with mice were so good that the tech-
nique could be used on women right
away.

The research focused on young
women who become infertile because of
cancer treatment. But the therapy report-
edly could be used by women who want
to extend their child-bearing years or
avoid menopause.

Getting better with age: wine, cheese and Pitt students

Corrine LaFata

Staff Wrlter

If you are having trouble adjust-

ing to college life, you might be a

freshman.

The same might be true if you
are feeling homesick or frightened.

According to graduating Pitt
seniors polled in a survey last
spring, though, these feelings will
probably pass.

’ A survey conducted by Pitt's
Office of the Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs says freshmen have
difficulty adjusting to college life,
but there are ways to make the tran-
sition less rocky. '

Last spring, Robert Gallagher,
interim vice chancellor of student

affairs, distributed surveys to 40.

graduating seniors who were in lead-
ership positions. The surveys asked
them to reﬂect on their experiences
at Pitt.

A large number of the seniors
wrote that their first year at Pitt
made them feel overwhelmed,

scared, lonely or confused. They.

cited problems such as the difficulty
of being separated from family and
friends, of trying to make new
"friends and of adjusting to college
life in general. A

The seniors also wrote, however,
that they were able to resolve their

ideas

‘lmz llwvmlw ll W‘)/'
M

difficulties to have a "successful"
experience at Pitt. _

Gallagher said he was fascinated
"that these ‘high-achieving students
in leadership positions who are
ready to graduate came to campus
frightened and unsure. If that hap-
pened to our student leaders, what
about the rest of our students?"

Due to the findings of the survey,
Gallagher would like to further
address the needs of first year stu-
dents at Pitt. . . ‘

"We need to focus more on the
students and what we can do to make
the campus climate more responsive
to their needs, he said. "If they get
through that first year, they usually

stick it out. There are probably many
others who we might have been able
to salvage." .

So what is the chief way to over-
come this freshman problem of lone-
liness? .

Gallagher seemed to think that,
at least for the group he surveyed,
the key was involvement in student
organizations and activities.

Most of the individuals surveyed
got involved in the University
through different activities. Some
met other people by participating in
floor meetings or by joining campus
organizations. Others got involved in
‘community service organizations.

"The more students get involved,
the more likely they are to be suc-
cessful," said Gallagher. "Those who
get involved also seem to be students
who commit to studious activities."

Academic problems also seemed
to plague many of the participants in
their freshman year. When asked
how they overcame those chal-
lenges, the seniors noted how they
"studied more," allowed the "novelty
of being on [their] own and hanging
out until all hours of the night" to
wear off, and how they revised their
priorities.

According to the survey's find-
ings, as the students progressed in
their academic majors, they became
less concerned about personal prob-
lems and more concerned about the
University's institutional problems.

The seniors complained about
problems such as the housing short-
ages and how some of them were
forced to move off campus in their
second year. Some were not pleased
with the. quality of food services on
campus. Others mentioned that their
advisers gave bad advice, were not
well informed, or were just too busy
to give them the proper attention.

Many of the seniors used exist-
ing resources to work through their
problems. To ease registration chal-
lenges, they read the student hand-
book and learned how to make alter-
nate schedules. In other cases, they
became informed about the classes
they needed to take and learned not
to depend on their advisers for the
information. 

Gallagher believes that while the
results of the survey come from 'a
very limited sample of students, the
findings do suggest that the
University needs to focus more on
students‘ personal adjustment issues,
especially for first year students.

But for now, Gallagher's advice
to students is "not to give up. There
are lots of people around to help.
This is a wonderful time in students‘
lives. Get. the most out of it. Take
advantage of the resources around
you."

OPINION

In the name of the Father, Son and John   

James Maude

Woodward must deal

with our legal system  

A 19-year-old British woman was convicted of
murder on Oct. 30 in an American court of law for
_shaking and killing a child she babysat when he
wouldn’t stop ‘crying. British networks made it a
media circus, partly because laws to protect the
integrity of courtrooms prevent them from airing tri-
als held in their own country. Now, many British are
angry about the verdict and ranting about a “barbar-
ic” American legal system. The scary part is that

British opinion might affect American sentiments.

The British should mind their own business.

There are some legitimate questions that have
been raised about this trial which the judge, Hiller
Zobel, must deal with. Since the trial ended, many
jurors said they’ would have found the woman, au
pair Louise Woodward, only guilty of manslaughter
had that option been given to them. With only a
manslaughter conviction, Woodward would have
been sentenced to a lesser punishment than the life
in prison she now faces. Judge Zobel must now
decide whether to uphold the life sentence that see-
ond-degree murder carries with it.

But all this is legal technical detail. The fact is,
this woman committed a crime in America and was
tried in an American legal system.

She came here. She did something wrong. Now
she must face the consequences.

a British opinion should have no bearing whatso-
ever on our judicial system. She is subject to
American law the same as anybody else who comes
here, just as any American who commits a crime in
another country is subject to that nation’s laws.

We’ve had a teenager caned in Singapore for
vandalism. It may seem harsh to us, but it was their
law and his responsibility.

And we’ve had a young girl wrongly imprisoned
in Britain. She was falsely accused of being
involved in an IRA bombing. Evidence to prove her
innocence came out and she was freed — 14 years
later.

The judgements may not always seem fair, but
they follow a system, and tasteful to the British or
not, this is the system Woodward has to deal with.

At the very least, we can hope that public opin-
ion will have no effect on Judge Zobel. Whatever
Zobel decides, it must be done purely with regard to
the law and what the judge feels is right, not what

popular opinion would have of her.

Halloween — the most
sacred of American holidays.
Children in costumes running
around collecting candy, houses
decorated with garishly bright
orange pumpkin-shaped .oma-
ments, the crisp clear sound of
“Trick or Treat!” in the air. Well,
I’m not into all that rubbish, so I
thought I’d do something differ-
ent this time around.

My friends — all two of
them —- and I decided to have a
little innocent get-together. They,
after all, were here on holiday
from South Africa, and since we
never really celebrated
Halloween, we had to make this
an occasion to remember, or if
we became too drunk to remem-
ber, make it a damn ﬁne night
out anyway. Darren, Shaun and I
decided to partake in a nice little
Halloween pastime: Satan wor-
shipping and paganism.

We gathered up all our
resources needed for such a
bash. We used our fake IDs to
purchase the crates of liquor,
bought a dozen black candles
from Vlficks ‘n Sticks, grabbed a
chicken from Phi Sigma Delta’s
house and went to an Upper St.
Clair High School football
match and picked up three 16-
year-old cheerleaders who we
hoped were virgins (Virgin
cheerleaders? As Americans say;
“Yeah, right!”). All in the name
of jolly good irmocent fun.

Since the Cathedral lawn
was being used for the
Undergraduate Economic
Society Halloween bash (I
thought the UES president

The Pitt News

looked rather nice in her Average
Variable Cost Curve costume),
we had to ﬁnd another venue for
our outdoor activity. We spotted
an empty ﬁeld on the side of I-
79, and we thought it looked like
the dandy place for it. We lit a
bonﬁre, set up the candles,
slaughtered the chicken, covered
our naked bodies in its blood
then put the music of our master
on our portable CD player.
Nothing like a bout of pagan
activity in the moonlight — all to
the sound of John Tesh.

“Hail Tesh! Hail Tesh! Hail
Tesh!” we chanted as we danced
around the fire, New Age music
ﬂittering in the air. We then play-
er our master’s songs backward;
funny, it sounded pretty much
the same. Who knows why we
brought the three teenage cheer-
leaders — because our master’s
music is such a turn off? At least
we had the alcohol. We actually
thought our master was perform-
ing for us from the beyond at one
point, but it turned out to be a cat
caught in a barbed wire fence.

We did eventually get
around to “dealing” with the
cheerleaders, but this is The Pitt
News (and as long as we keep a
certain reporter under control,
not Hustler), so I won’t divulge
any details. Needless to say, it
was a fun experience, but we
were so tanked from the
Stolichnaya and worked up on
our master’s music, we could
have been having sex with the
Golden Girls and would have
been none the wiser.

After this night of depraved
activity, we had one of those
philosophical talks. Well, as
philosophical as people can get

According to yesterday’s issue of
The New York Trrnes, many states have
begun performance analyses of their col-
leges and universities. Similar to the
ranking systems that high school seniors
ﬁnd in many publications when they go
college hunting, these systems have been
looked at by states for determining how
much ﬁnancial support they will offer
schools, rather than basing such support
purely on enrollment numbers.

Someareleeryoftheranking sys-
tems, however, thinking that the factors
whicharequantiﬁed maynotbeaccurate
measures of quality.

For example, take graduation rates.

The common argument says that
schools which graduate most students in
four to ﬁve years are doing a goodjob
and that schools which don’t graduate as
manyinthattimeframearenotdoingso
well.

The Times article notes several dif-
ﬁculties with that ﬁgure, since it can be
manipulated by schools simply by rais-
ing admissions standards. The rates can
.alsobeincreasedbymakingco1nseseas-
ier and passing more students.

That story, however, as well as the

THE PITT NEWS

rating unit, misses a. very
important point; Staying in
school longer can be good for
students.

Students who spend an extra year in
school are not necessarily doing poorly.
Some may be pursuing a double major.

Some may have changed their majors
late when they discovered subjects that

really grabbed them. Some may have
taken extra time to take advantage of
opportunities‘ they may never have
again, like study abroad

Steven Jobs, co-founder of Apple
Computer, Inc., once gave a commence-
ment address to high school students,
recommending that they prolong ﬂreir
undergraduate days as long as possible.
Six years, he suggested. He told them to
take advantage of every opportunity that
college olfers them, because it’s a once-
in-a-lifetime experience, and the work-
ing world will still be there when they
get out

Cheers to Hugh Downs, who took

News is what’s important to peo-

ple’s lives, even when occasionally peo-
ple don’t know that it’s important.
Sometimes covering the news means
examining what a politician does on his
oﬁ‘-hours because he’s a public ﬁgure

and his integrity has a direct relationship ,   

with his job. But not so for a sportscast-
er. His personal life doesn’t affect the

Lavish spending. Embezzlement.
Assault. These are the words being tossed at
a bunch of high-proﬁle students this tenn.

Do you know "what Pitt administrators
are doing to guarantee that you understand
these accusations? Next to nothing, and sure-
ly no more than they have to.

Remember when you were a kid and
thought you could always trust the people in
charge? School administrators? The police?

Now consider these recent campus
developments:

Witnesses tell us Kirk McMullen, a
Panthers tight end, was anested for sending
two guys at a Halloween party to the hospi-
tal with busted faces.

Last Sunday, Pitt News reporters took
down the victims’ statements and called the
campus police for details.

But whoever was on duty refused to
conﬁrm the report. We were forced to hold
the story for 24 hours. The next day I visited
Deputy Chief Gary Moses about the inci-
dent. He hurried me away, refusing to dis-
cuss any details of the arrest. He said all per-
tinent information was in the police blotter.

Guess what —— the blotter didn’t even

list McMullen’s name. State law says that

campus police forces must identify in a daily

crime log the individuals they anest.

Pitt Police officials say the missing
name was an honest mistake. Other individ-
uals were listed in that particular log for
offenses like drunken driving and drug deal-
ing. Then again, none of them were high pro-

ﬁle students (or football players)" like
McMullen.

A few months ago, SGB President
Justin DalMolin was accused of spending
thousands of student dollars over the sum-
mer on luxury cars, four—star hotels and
extravagant meals. This money came from
your student activities fund.

The SGB’s spending habits created
such an uproar that Student Activities
Director Joe Cavalla conducted an “investi-
gation.” ‘ -

Guess what he found out? DalMolin did
nothing wrong. ‘

Guess what else? The details of this lit-
tle investigation are a secret. No one can
know what they looked at. Shhh. V

But he did nothing wrong, that’s for
sure. I guess we should just their word for it.

What a joke.

Ifthe overwhelming evidence they have
secretly compiled proves DalMolin retumed
the money he was over-allocated, and that
the extravagant car and hotel rooms were
purchased at a discount price, then tl1at’s

v

If he’s clean then there is nothing to be
afraid of. What’s the worst that could happen
— the proof ends up on page one?

I believe they didn’t provide the evi-
dence because it doesn’t exist. This silly,
clandestine investigation only makes me
more suspicious. More than $3,000 worth of
questions still remain for DalMolin.

Two weeks ago the allocations chair,
Gerald Klayman —- Da1Molin’s friend and
former roommate —- was accused of embez-
zling thousands of dollars ﬁom the activities

ﬁmd for his own beneﬁt.
Letmesaythisagain:Themanwhois
supposed to distribute funds to student orga-
nizations is being investigated under suspi-
cion that he pocketed more than $5,000 of
that money. Klayman immediately dropped
out of the SGB presidential election and

I resigned his post as the allocations chair. No

one’s seen his face on campus since.

For days, I begged student government
members such as Marquette Bowman, Ryan
Weidenrniller and David Eisenberg to

, explain what exactly they found that impli-

cated Klayman. Their answer“. It’s out of our
hands. Some leaders. ’

Bowman produced a two page report
full of bureaucratic nonsense last week that
he says exonerates SGB. It oﬁicially washes
their, hands of any wrongdoing, according to
Bowman. Too bad it doesn’t provide a shred
of evidence or any detailed information.

“Don’t you trust us?” Bowman asked
me, when I told him I wanted proof that
SGB had not misused ﬁrnds over the surn-
mer.

No. I do not trust them.
He still could not say exactly what
Klayman had done wrong.

Reporters have managed to scratch a
few more bits of infomration about Klayman
from Pitt spokesman Ken Service. Internal
auditors are looking at Klayman’s ﬁles. But
their investigation is secret.

Pitt Police are investigating Klayman
for criminal activity. Surprise. Their investi-
gation is secret, too. ,

There’s a slim chance that all of the
information uncovered about Klayman will

go public in the end, but I doubt it. If
Klayrnan’s innocent then they’ll never admit
to making erroneous accusations.

Just look how straightforward they were
when they “prov ” DalMolin did not mis-
use frmds this summer.

Pitt’s actions show that the University is
more concerned with image than the truth.
That’s a miserable shame for an institution of
learning. IfKlayman’s not innocent, if he did
embezzle that $5,000, then I predict the
proof will go to Pitt’s Judicial Board.

Then it becomes a matter of conﬁden-
tiality. The J -board is the ultimate secret
keeper.

- Klayman will then be hustled away qui-
etly and Pitt oﬂicials will cover their ears and
close their eyes until the whole matter goes
away.

But this is no mere strident. Klayman is
a public oﬂicial appointed by an elected
body. If he misused that money, if a person
in thatposition can become so corrupt that he
ﬂat out steals like a petty thief, then I demand
to know about it.

Everyone who has some stake in this
University should demand it too. It’s not too
late.

To the Office of Student Activities, to
the Pitt Police, to the Student Government
Board, to the internal auditors, I beg you -
don’t cover this one up. _

Give us a reason to trust you.

What have you got to hide?

Anthony Bremican is tired of people putting

Vonteego Cummings scored a
game-high 25 points to lead ‘ the
Pittsburgh men's basketball team to a
79-75 victory over Marathon -Oil on
Sunday afternoon.

Cummings scored eight consecu-
tive points for the Panthers down the
stretch, when the game was on the line,
to ice the victory for Pitt, which closed
out the exhibition season. _

Pittsburgh Head Coach Ralph
Willard was happy with the way
Cummings responded, but he was even
happier about the way the team played
as a whole, in only its second game
together.

“I was pleased with the way we
played from a defensive standpoint,
especially during the first half,”
Willard said. “They only scored two
ﬁeld goals on our man-to-man defense.
I think that is an exceptional job
because they have some good players
on that team.

“I also thought we did a good job
offensively. We shot 49 percent from
the ﬂoor, but we still have some things
to work on.”

The Panthers began the game on
fire. First, sophomore guard Kellii
Taylor nailed two three-pointers. Then
freshman center Attila Cosby hit a
jumper in the lane, and Cummings and
freshman Ricardo Greer each added a
three-pointer to give Pittsburgh an 18-4
lead.

women’s basketball team
lost a close exhibition
game to the Klondaika-

In the 75-67 loss,
Panther senior forward
Latia Howard led the team
in total points with 16, in
field goals with a total of
six, and in free throws
totaling nine.

Also adding to the
game were senior center

forward Alecia Balich.
Woods contributed 12
points to the effort,
including five field goals
and two free throws.
Balich also contributed 12
points and netted six field
goals.

Other high scorers
were junior guard/forward

and freshman guard

will be expected to lead
the team for the rest of
this season the way they
did on Saturday night.
Last year, Howard
was the team leader in
scoring, offensive and
defensive rebounds, and
free throws. She played in
every one of the team’s 30
regular season games and
ended the season with a
.502 average scoring per-
centage, an average of
.640 in free throws, and
223 total rebounds. Per
game, she averaged 14.9
points, 7.4 rebounds, and

Woods, the team’s
other veteran, also added
to the totals last season.
By playing in all 30
games, she averaged 14.4
points per game, had a
.725 free throw average,
and amassed 73 rebounds.

Many new faces were
also seen during the game
on Saturday night. All but

Akram contributed the most
points of the freshmen with three
field goals and also added one
defensive rebound. Toney was the
freshman leader in rebounds with
one on offense and two on defense.

Blanton contributed four points
to the score and also came up with
two rebounds.

Women's Head Coach Kirk
Bruce said, “We’re really a young
team, with six new players on the
roster, four being freshmen.” He
added, “We just have to go out there
and give it everything we’ve got.”

The team hopes to use its combi-
nation of young talent backed by
experience to improve its status this
season. The Lady Panthers ended
last year with an overall record of 8-

saying that “even though this team
has many new faces, we do have the

more forward Isaac Hawkins hit a
jumper in the lane and then minutes
later excited the crowd with a mon-
strous alley-oop dunk.

However, the Panthers began to
cool off, and Marathon’s Charles

' Minlend began to heat up. He scored 10

points to cut the Pittsburgh lead to 40-
32 at the half.

Marathon came out firing in the
second half behind six straight points
from Willie Murdaugh.

The Panthers, on the other hand,
began the second half with a scoring
drought. They didn’t score until the
16:32 mark of the second half on a
Cosby jumper.

“We came out [in the second half] a
little bit ﬂat and a little bit tired,”
Willard said. “We’ve been working our
guys hard in practice. We’re trying to
get them in really great shape because
we only have seven players [available
due to injury]. I had a feeling that our
legs would be a little bit tired.”

The Panthers and Marathon then
passed the lead back and forth with
numerous turnovers and fouls. At one
point, it seemed like neither team could
even buy a ﬁeld goal.

That’s when Cummings decided to
take the game into his own hands.

He was fouled on a three-point
attempt and converted all three of his
free throws.

The next trip down the ﬂoor, he

drained a three from the top of the key.
And on the next Panther possession,
Cummings began to drive to the basket,
then stopped and popped a jumper just
inside the three-point arc.

The Panthers never trailed again,
but Marathon didn’t quit and kept the
game interesting in the ﬁnal two min-
utes of play.

Marathon’s Curt Smith scored ﬁve
points to keep the game close. But Isaac
Hawkins tipped in a shot off his shoul-
der, and Cosby added a layup in the
ﬁnal seconds to secure the win for Pitt.

“I was really pleased with our over-
all effort and the fact that we were able
to play with the intensity we were able
to play with during the 40 minutes with
only seven players,” Willard said.

The Pitt coach added, “They are
learning to play in situations that nor-
mally [the freshmen] wouldn’t, and the
biggest thing is that they are learning to
play under fatigue. At different points
of the basketball game, our guys sur-
rendered to fatigue, but they are learn-
ing how to get through that, and they
will be effective.” ,

Willard said he was pleased with
Cummings’ effort, but he believes
Cummings could be even more effec-
tive by getting teammates the ball.

“I think the big thing with Vonteego
is for him to get the other people the
opportunity to score,” Willard said.
“They are learning to play with each
other and learning where guys like to
score.”

Cummings rallies Pill‘ lo a late second-half surge

Matt Grove

Staff Wrlter

Pitt men’s basketball Head
Coach Ralph Willard calls Vonteego
Cummings a lead guard. V

A plethora of basketball maga-
zines have labeled him a traditional
point guard. .

No. matter what adjective is
used to precede “guard,” junior
standout Cummings has shown that
he will be the nucleus of the 1997-
98 Pittsburgh Panthers basketball
team. '

Yesterday in a 79-75 win over
Marathon Oil, the 6-3 guard from

Baton Rouge scored a game-high 25 .

points on 11 for 15 shooting, includ-
ing 4 _for 5 from the three-point
range.

Cummings also was near per-
fect from the free-throw line, hitting
seven of eight attempts.

“I think I had to step up and
score because we really came out
ﬂat,” Cummings said. “Especially
at the beginning of the second half,
when there was a dead period.”

The sleek ﬂoor leader got
Pittsburgh out to a .fast start, knock-
ing down a three—pointer, hitting
two free throws and dishing out two
early assists as the Panthers jumped
out to a 12-0 lead.

“We’ve talked about this this
year, and we realize that his biggest
leap this year has to be getting other
people the ball. That’s what a lead
guard has to do,” Willard said fol-
lowing the game. “He scored 25
points today and only took 15 shots.
That’s a heck of "an effort. He’s just

~ got to get to the point where he can

get other people their shots.”

As Marathon Oil made it a close
game late in the second half,
Cummings stepped up his and the
rest of the tearn’s play to stave off
the rally.

With the score knotted at 62
with 5:01 remaining, Cummings
was fouled on a three-point attempt
and made all three free throws.

Less than 30 seconds later, he.

knocked down ‘a long three—pointer
to extend the Panthers’ lead to 68-
63.

Willard has_ attributed this high-
quality play to the hard work in
practice not only by Cummings, but
by the entire team. The Panthers’
lead guard deﬁnitely agrees.

“Everyone’s come out, and
we’re just trying to work hard,”
Cummings said. “We know that’s
what you have to do to succeed in
this league, and that’s what we try
and do every day.”
