After performing hand transplants, medical center’s review board will decide whether surgeons can give patients new faces.

Maura Natale
For The Pitt News

About a month after performing
its second double hand transplant,
the University of Pittsburgh Medi-
cal Center is considering using the

. technology to perform face trans-

plants. _

Dr. Joseph E. Losee and other
members of the center’s transplant
team have asked UPMC’s Institu-
tional Review Board — a group of
surgeons, psychologists and other
medical experts who work to make

sure the center abides by its ethics
policies —— to consider allowing it
to perform face transplants.

Dr. Vijay Gorantla, another
member of the transplantteam,
said he expects the board to make
its decision by the end of next
month.

Face transplants, he said, use
similar techniques to the ones
UPMC surgeons used in its hand
transplants.

For the hand transplants,
UPMC surgeons used a new tech-
nique, which some have labeled
the “Pittsburgh Protocol.” Before

they developed the protocol, doc-
tors would give transplant patients
three immunosuppresive drugs,
which keep their bodies from

ﬁghtingoff foreign cells, such as

bacteria. ,

col,” doctors give transplant pa-

Zach Miller and Andrew Manderi-
no said they’re used to taking their
shirts off— just not for money.

“We heard people [during the
auction] saying, ‘Oh look, they are
wearing matching shirts!’ and I
was just thinking, ‘No no no, we
wore these shirts to take them
off,” Miller said. “It was inevi-
table.”

Miller’ and Manderino of Pan-
ther CrossFit, a student exercise
organization at Pitt, were just
two of 20 students representing
various student organizations last
night at the 8th Annual Charity
Date Auction. Pitt College Demo-
crats hosted the event in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union’s Lower Lounge,
and all proceeds went toward the
American Heart Association.

Pitt student Nicole Pawloski
attended the event and said she
“came here to have a good time
with [her] friends and support a
good cause.”

The event featured groups such
as Pitt Crew, Pitt FeelGood, the
Alpha Phi Omega co-ed service
fraternity, Students Taking Action
Now: Darfur and more. Student
leaders such as Homecoming King

Dan Thomas and Pitt Pathﬁnders ‘

President Mike Pisarcik were also
auctioned. - , ‘

Dates were typically auctioned
for around $50 to $75. '

Alicia Harris, programming di-
rector of Pitt College Democrats,
started to organize the event in
December. - —

“We all used our connections on
campus to get people to volunteer
to be auctioned,” Harris said.

Beneﬁting a different charity
each year, Pitt College Democrats
chose the American Heart Asso-
ciation this year to raise awareness
of heart disease. , s _

The auctions at the event raised
$1,107 for the charity.

Andrew Sabo, president of Pitt

of the night, said he was very hap-
py with the results.

Lessons learned from Summits past

Toronto officials look to Pittsburgh for guidance as they prepare to host the next G-20 Summit this June

Olivia Garber

ForiThe Pitt News pp

Toronto ofﬁcials, who are preparing to host
the G-20 Summit this su_mrner, said they hope
they can learn from Pittsburgh’s experiences
last fall.

Adam Vaughan, a representative for Ward
20, the part of Toronto that will host the Sum-
mit, said in a letter to his constituents that he
wonders whether the city is prepared for the
foreign dignitaries and protesters whowill come
to the city for thejune 26-27 Summit.

“Summits such as this in Quebec City and »

Seattle have presented serious challenges to
host cities,” Vaughan wrote in the letter, pub-
lished by Canwest News Service. “Anti-terrorism
precautions, crowd control and the reality that
these meetings usually draw large numbers of
protesters, will mean that much of the wardwill
be severely impacted by security initiatives.”
This is not the ﬁrst time questions have been
raised about Canada’s chosen site for the Sum-
mit.Before movingto Ward20, the G-20 Summit
was tentatively scheduled to occur in Huntsville,
Ontario, where the smaller G8 Summit will be
held June 25-26. But despite thejnvestment of
millions of dollars into renovating Huntsville, the
Canadian government decided that the citywas
just too small to handle the larger responsibility

of a G—2O Summit, and the location changed to
Ward 20 of Toronto.
Vaughan is asking that they change it

333111
. “The folks organizing the event aren’t from

. Toronto,” Vaughan said in a phone interview._

“Theythink downtown closes at 6 p.m. We need
more communication between the government
and city residen .”

Representatives from Mayor Luke Raven-

4stahl’s office did not respond to requests for

Board. “It’s all about communication.”

She said she thought Pittsburgh could have
avoided some of the controversy surrounding
its Summit, which resulted in 193 arrests and
an estimated $50,000 in damage, if it had more
clearly outlined restrictions for protesters. i

“If ground rules are laid out, then all’s fair,”
Pittinger said, adding that one thingthat could

have been done differently is having a “more A

vigorous liaisonship” between police force and
citizens. '

   

It’s all about communication.

Elizabeth. Pittinger, executive director of the Citizen Police Review Board

comment, and representatives for the Pittsburgh ’

Bureau of Police declined to comment on either
Summit. . _
Other Pittsburgh ofﬁcials said alack of com-
munication was one of the principal problems
of the G-20 Summit.
“Communication,” said Elizabeth Pittinger,
executive director of the Citizen Police Review

Pitt emergency management professor Lou-
ise Comfort said, “ [The police] need to explain
to them thatwe’re not tryingto block you, we’re
trying to organize.”

While Vaughan said that he has apprehen-
sions about having the Summit in his ward be-

cause‘ of the lack of communication between

the government and city residents, he is not

concerned with Toronto’s ability to handle
the protests that traditionally come with the
G—20.

“Canada has aldifferent political culture, a
different approach to policing,” he said.

In May 2009, Tamil protesters gathered
in Toronto to protest against a civil war in Sri
Lanka.

“There were 10,000 people in front of the
U.S. consulate, and we resolved the demonstra-
tion without a single arrest,” Vaughan said.

Vaughan attributes Toronto’s ability to peace-
fully handle protests to the city’s “tolerance for
democratic rights,” a tolerance that will be ap-
plied during the Summit.

Toronto officials underwent an operational
review of Pittsburgh’s G-20 Summit to gain an
understanding of the scope of demonstrators,
Vaughan said. They hope to strike abalance be-
tween securityand democratic debate. Vaughan
sees the Summit as an opportunity to provide
a platform, not only for global leaders but for

those with a f'rusu‘ation of not getting heard to

present a different perspective.

The United States Secret Service, the Royal '

Canadian Mounted Police and the Ontario Pro-
vincial Policewillhelp the Toronto Police Service
to protect the event.

f‘Planningwill be crucial,” Comfort said, add-
ing that the police need to “take a  humane
approach in working with citizens.”

‘Tied into your body fabric’

Faces 4 1

tients one immunomodulating drug instead
of the three immunosuppressive drugs,
Gorantla said. When they use imrnunomodu—
lation, doctors both harvest a donor’s face
and take cells from the spinal cord. They

inject the stem cells into the transplant pa- -

tient before he undergoes surgery. This al-
lows a patient’s body to become used to the
foreign cells before the transplant, reducing
the chances of the patient’s body rejecting
the transplant, Gorantla said.

Dr. Gerald Brandacher, a surgeon at UPMC
and the founder of the American Society of
Reconstructive Transplantation, said UPMC
surgeons waited to perform the transplants
until they could develop the protocol. “We
were cautious because we wanted to come
up with a safe protocol,” he said.

Eight face transplants have been per-
formed throughout the world.

Losee said the immunosuppressive drugs
could have several serious side—effects, such
as cancer. Because the drugs weaken the
immune system, people with chronic condi-
tions, such as the Human Immunodeﬁciency
Virus, aren’t eligible for the transplants,
Brandacher said. i‘

Gorantla said people with facial defor-
mities are often willing to take the risks
because, “a face is tied into your body fab-

ric.”

Brandacher said the suicide rate for
people with facial deformities is above 90
percent.

Face transplants can givepeople with
facial deformities more movement and sen-
sation than even the best prosthetics could,
Brandacher said.

Losee said the procedure is often cheaper
than reconstructive surgeries. The costs of
the transplants vary depending upon the
person. A doctor who performed a face
transplant in Cleveland last spring told
the Associated Press that she estimated
that the cost was between $250,000 and

V $300,000.

The donor’s faces will look different on
the people who receive them than they did
on the donors. Doctors search for faces that
won’t look like a mask when they’re trans-
planted, Losee said.

Unlike traditional organ transplants that
simply require the donor’s consent, surgeons
ensure they have the approval of living family
members before selecting a face transplant
donon

If UPMC decides to perform face trans-
plants, it will be monitored by the Data
Safety Monitoring Board, a panel of -health
care workers. The board works to ensure
that UPMC meets the IRB requirements and
makes any changes necessary.

student would have to fill out and ‘submit
to the University.

Pitt senior Caryn Goldenberg said she
appreciated that SGB moved to Nordy’s
Place.

“I think it’s a nice environment to have
you guys here. I used to go up to the eighth
floor, and it’s deﬁnitelya little more open
and a little more informal,” she said.

But Goldenberg voiced some con-
cerns.

“It’s really hard to hear people, espe-
cially speakers,” she said.

She mentioned that the sounds of Nor-

dy’s Place might drown out speakers for '

people sitting far away in the audience.
The meeting last night began with mi-
crophone problems, as it did last week, but

,. the table was adorned with new ofﬁcial

name plaques of each Board member.

Board President Charlie Shull thanked
Caryn for her input and said next meet-
ing he would try to have a microphone
for speakers.

ing a group’s allocations decision when no

common, such as tuition and state appropria-
tions, she said.

“Eventhoughwe mayhave differences, Iurge
people to work together and look at the bigger
picture,” Smith said.

Smith said after meeting with the United
States Student Association and attending a Big
Ten Student Conference, she learned that many
other states have statewide coalitions as well.

Pitt Student Government Board President
Charlie Shull said he heard the coalition was
in the planning stages. Shull said persuing a
coalition is “tremendous” and by “pulling our
resources together, we can advance our own
institutions.”

Sean O’Connell, services review chair of the
Temple Student Government, said he hadn’t
heard about the statewide coalition but noted
that Temple’s student body president, Kylie Pat-

for more clout

terson, formed a similar coalition with Philadel-
phia—area schools — the Philadelphia Student
Government Caucus.

The caucus, whose ﬁrst meetingwill be held
March 20, includes St. Joseph’s, Drexel and La
Salle universities, as well as other schools from
the Philadelphia area.

O’Connell said representatives from each
school can put together issues to discuss at the
meeting. The caucus is designed to represent
students who represent alarge part of the popu-
lation and to give them “more of a voice in city
issues,” he said.

Penn State has worked with Temple in the
past to form a tuition coalition, and schools
learned from the project, Smith said.

-The lnition coalitionis much smallerinscale
than what is planned with the student govern-
ment leaders, Smith said.

ey for a good cause,” Sabo said.

The auction began with the pair of Miller
and Manderino, who inspired cheers and
whistles throughout an audience of about
80 students —- especially when showing
skin.

Miller enjoyed performing stunts such
as one-armed and clapping push-ups, while
Manderino unexpectedly carried out two
handstands. One lasted for ﬁve seconds.

“On the cover of the Sex Edition of The
Pitt News  need I say more?” Sabo said,

while auctioning off the pair to the audi-
ence.

Buyers received a gift card of up to $25
upon buying the featured student leaders
for their “date.” Local restaurants, such as
Joe Mamas, Fuel & Fuddle, Eat’n Park and
Hofbréiuhaus donated the gift cards.

The night was full of surprises, such as a
woman in a Feelgood bright-colored sand-
wich costume, a step-dance by two mem-
bers of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Panther
CrossFitter Ryan Samson’s shirt-toss into

the crowd and a rap song performance by
Bre Behun.

Andrew Voystock from Pitt Crew earned
the most money during the auction. Wearing
a shirt, tie and dress pants, his friend Eric
Eﬁnger “bought” him for $180.

“He is worth a lot more than $180,”
Eﬁnger said.

Emcee and Pitt College Democrats mem-

Digital billboard
blitz safe enough

p e’ve all seen some pretty
creative methods of ad-
vertisi-ng, like the Oscar

Mayer Weiner truck or taping ﬂiers
up everywhere around campus.

And now, the humble billboard
— a staple in the advertisingin-
dustry that’s more than a century
old — is being upgraded for the
21st century.

Currently, only about 2,000
of the 450,000 billboards in the
United States are digital. But the
advertising industry is making a
push to bring thousands more to
roads, according to The New York
Times.

Sure, such billboards take more
than a couple watts of electricity to
keep their products glowing, but
there’s a bigger issue surround-
ing their implementation: trafﬁc
safety. Michigan and Minnesota
lawmakers recently held hearings
on legislation that would delay the
construction of digital billboards,
because, even though the new bill-
boards already are and continue
to be installed on roads, legisla-
tures want to be sure they’re not
too dangerous of a distraction to
drivers.

Referred by some as “televi—
sion on a stick,” such billboards
will only cause more car accidents
given their bright, impossible-not-
to—notice displays that will garner
more than just a quick glance, crit-
ics say.

pp Still, these billboards shouldn’t
turn the highway into the Las Ve-
gas Strip, although the images
can change every six to eight
seconds, which is actually one of
their strongest selling points. One
billboard can be sold to multiple

advertisers as the ads displayed
cycle continuously. The signs can-
not use video or animation.

A 2007 study from the Virginia
Tech Transportation Institute that
looked at drivers’ in-car behavior
found that digital billboards didn’t
change drivers’ actions, although
opponents say this study was
funded by the billboard industry.
Still, with the plethora of driver
distractions — from talking on
cell phones to texting to deer wan-
dering onto highways — station-
ary, digital billboards hardly seem
a harrowing threat. Advertising
often involves displaying some big
logo or brief tagline that even a
quick ﬂash of the eyescan detect
and instantly recognize. Whether
there’s any subliminal recognition
is another topic, but as long as
the digital ads don’t require real
reading, they’re like their prede-
cessors, with the exception that
they’ll probably attract less spray-
painted graﬂiti.

Clear Channel, one of the na-
tion’s biggest billboard companies,
told The New York Times such dig-
ital billboards could be used for
purposes other than advertising.
For example, radio stations could
display sports scores, and news
organizations could ﬂash head-
lines. in a whole new way. There
need to be careful limits, however.
Anything requiring more than a
cursory glance could prompt a
legitimate distraction. '

Of course, these billboards add
to a world already ﬂooded with
advertisements. They could be an-
noying, but hopefully they won’t
prove dangerous should they be-
come more proliﬁc.

coverage you can handle, visit

For The Pitt News

A few days ago over breakfast, my
roommate told me the following
story: A guy came up to her while she
was out and leaned in with this ﬂirty,
trying-to-be—sexy voice to say, “Wow,
you really look like Britney Spears.
You really do.”

Althoughpinpointingthe similari-
ties between celebrities and “normal”
people has become a guilty pleasure
in modern society, she made it clear
to distinguish the two, adding that he
approached herthe samewaylaterin
the evening, all while giving her a se-
ductive smile. I never found out if she
would’ve been attracted to him other-
wise, but the thought ofhim referring
to her as the emotionally unstable pop
singer was a deal-breaker for her, es-
pecially after the second try.

It wasn’t long before I stopped
her to say that I had won the award
for worst pickup line that previous
night.

A kid visiting from one of our top
rival schools started off with “You

lookin’ sexy with that heart on your
necklace. I mean, I’rn throwin’ you
shots, and you hittin’ homeruns,
baby!)

Is this what happens when you’re
stuck in the middle of nowhere for so
long? Unforumately, this monstrosity
didn’t end here. After a couple hours
of mingling, he came up to me again,
and after a bit of small talk, walked
behind me and leaned in to whisper,
“Have you ever had abig d*ck inyour
a**‘?”

Are you freakin’ kidding me? I im-
mediately walked away, not sure if I
should laugh or slap him in the face.
Do people actually have the courage to
say these things to strangers‘? Ifso, I
mightnever date again. Seriously, Iwﬂl
not accept one dinner invitation.

I must admit for the sake of men
everywhere, this guy had the absolute
worst lines that I’ve ever heard, and
most of you don’t even come close to
this. Actually, I don’t think I’ve ever
felt so much disrespect for a dude. If
Iwere one ofhis friends, I’d deﬁnitely

Pickup line precautions

Think you’ve got the best pickup lines?

It works both ways. I am furious
when a girl shuts down a completely
respectable prospectjustbecause he’s
an inch too short. .

There’s also the girl I knew who
called one of my best ﬁiends around
thirty times — right before bang-
ing on every door and window of
his house -— because he went to the
bar and didn’t answer her calls. They
weren’t even together! Those are two
primary examples of reasons for men
to call all girls either shallow or psycho.
Acts like these are injustices coming
from both men and women.

Bad manners and distaste aren’t
just a_meet—and-greet affair. A bad
introduction leads to an even worse
date. .

About a month ago, a guy who I
metatapartyasked meoutonadate.I
forgot to save his number in my phone
(not purposely!) and when he texted
me, I had no idea who the heck he
was. But I went along with it anyway,
despite the oddtexts and evenweirder
invitation to dinner.

Hollywood suffers high-grossing redundancy

 
   

» Steve Kaszycki
For The Pitt News

Being center-right, I feel a bit strange
makingthis statement: Movie studios
have become, well, too conservative.

No, I don’t mean in terms of sub-
ject matter. Studios are still inclinedto
put out the same type of anti—warﬁlms
thathave been around since Vietnam,
and they’llstillpresent requisite other
“message” ﬁlms.

But when it settles down and the
studios are setting their vision for the
year, far too many have come to rely
ontiredformulas. Thistactic fosters a
blithe public that doesn’t discern cin-
ematic quality and instead goes into a
movie theater as if it were a McDon-
ald’s: “I-Iere’s my $5, give me a Happy
Meal. It’libethe exactsamethingl got
lastwee ” '

How else to explain the myriad
romantic comedies’ lack of quality
romance and comedy? Take for ex-
ample: “Love Happens,” “All About
Steve,” “Leap Year” and “The Ugly
Truth.” Or just check out virtually ev-
ery Matthew McConaughey movie in
the lastﬁve years.

These movies continue to get made
becausethey continueto makemoney.

On the non-romantic comedy front,

one of the worst offenders in recent
memory was “Wild Hogs,” which re-

ceived mostly negative reviews. It made
$168 million atthe domesticboxofﬁce,

and directorWalt Beckerfollowed itup

with “Old Dogs,” a movie remarkable

for obtainingeven worse reviews than
its predecessor — Stephen Holden of
The NewYork'I'irnes called itan“imbe—

cilic, mean-spirited farce, which sneers

at adults.” Astonishingly, it has been

substantially less successful, gassing
only $48 million as of Feb. 7 and lend-

ing hope to the belief that Hollywood

has perhaps ﬁnally scraped the moldy
bottom of the cinematic barrel

Comedies are hardly the lone of-
fender. The tort11re—pom sub—genre of
horrorﬁlms has merciﬁiily gone out of
style, but each year new, stupid slashers
appear. They’re cinematic meth: low
budget, easy to make and possessing
aniche audiencethatwillalways eatup
more. Remakes have been the craze as
oflate,withcritically lambasted retell-
ings of “Halloween” and “Friday the
13th,” among others.

Aciionﬁlms, includingwhatpasses
as sci-ﬁ, suchas“’I‘ransformers,” have
also deluged thescreeninwanton acts
of st1ipidity—-the “National Treasure”
movies, the “Fast & Furious” series,
etc. Notice the trend: sequels. It’s not

enough to have Nicolas Cage uncover
inane conspiracies in oneﬁlm. No, we
need to repeat the same plot with in-
consequential details altered. It’s the
same phenomenon that grips some
textbook manufacturers —the realiza-
tion that going out and craﬁing a new
productishardto do. Instead, it seems

reviews, didn’t make much at the box

few illustrations and the table of con-

and improved!

Directors who try to do some-
thing different have a rough time of
it. “Moon,” a 2009 ﬁitn made on a

paltry $5 million budget, received gen- ‘

erally favorable reviews. Roger Ebert
praised it as “a superior example of
that threatened genre, hard science-
ﬁction.” “The Hurt Locker,” ataut, non-
preachy war ﬁlm, made less than $13

clamors for a sequel, and a follow-up
should certainly be proﬁtable — just
not proﬁtable enough for many sui-
dios who have embraced a mindset
of searching out $100 million invest-
ments that will gross $200 ‘million.
And the studio hopes to make much
of that proﬁtmargin intheﬁrstweek—

DVD? Nope, not interested.

Havingassailedsequels, you might

wonder why I include a “Serenit3f’ se-
quelas anartistically defensible project.
Itisbecause, like “The GodfatherPart
11,” a“Serenity” sequelwould represent
the expanding of an epic story — not
the stale rehashing of familiar plot el-

-ements with disregard to character

development.

Interestingly enough, the mod-
ern race to the bottom seems to be
the opposite of the “Hays Code” era
of Hollywood —- a time when Holly-
wood enforced a morally strident set
of guidelines upon directors. These
guidelines restricted the manner in
which narcotics, ﬁrearms, “white
slavery” andother questionable ma-
terial could be portrayed in ﬁlms.
This era produced groundbreaking
ﬁlms as “Citizen-Kane” and “Sunset
Boulevard.” Within the conﬁnes of a
sometimes draconian system —— i.e.
interracial romances were frowned
upon — artistic ventures ﬂourished.
Sure, there was plenty of ﬂuff. Elvis
spent his career making rubbish that
rivals “Fromjustin to Kelly” for the
awardfor “most unintelligent effort.”

But there were also the visionary
efforts. Unlill see a“Serenity” sequel,

- I’ll remain forlorn about the state of

contemporary cinema.

When people say they’re “re—

one of three things: 1. They’re

into the industry — people
who go into magazine editing,

clothes, meaning they care
about dressing well. 3. They’re
into labels, meaning their taste

‘The Price’ isright at the O’Reilly Theater

Pittsburgh Public Theaterwill begin performing Arthur Miller ’s family dynamic— focused drama, ‘The Price, ’ on Thursday.

Brendan Coticchia P

“The Price”

March 4 through April 4'

index.php I P

In the practice of antiquing,
debating about the price-of old or
rare furniture is common.

Actress Chandler_Vinton hopes
that people will debate about “The

Price”vas well — not over a piece
of furniture, however, but rather
over the moral issues raised by
Arthur Miller’s antique-centric
drama.

“I think people will walk outpof
the play debating over who’s right
and who’s wrong,” Vinton, who
plays Esther Franz, said. “I would
love to see audiences discussing
[which character’s] truth is more
accurate.”

On Thursday, March 4, at the
O’Reilly Theater downtown, the
Pittsburgh Public Theater and di-
rector Tracy Brigden will bring

the distinguished piece of Miller’s

repertoire to a local audience.
“The Price,” Miller’s 1968 play,

was one of his most successful

and popular works after 1949’s A

“Death of a Salesman.” While the
play might be more than 40 years
old, it remains “totally” relevant
to a 21st-century audience, Mar-
gie Romero, the communications
manager, said.

“It’s about two brothers who
took very different paths in their
life, and each is unhappy with the
choices the other made,” Romero
explained. “They haven’t spoken

. in years but then get together to

clean out their father’s attic af-
ter he dies. They begin to talk
about their choices, many based
on economics and what they
thought their father wanted and

‘the price they’ve paid for those

decisions.”

Vinton said that the _ play —
like many of Miller’s works —— of-
fers a set of challenges for actors,
including herself.

“The relationships are so com-
plex, and they can be really hard
to nail down. It’s challenging, as
an actor, to get to the heart of the

character,” Vinton said. “Lots of
times it doesn’t make sense, but
in actually playing [the role], it
all comes together.”

Her character, Esther, is a
“tough lady” who has “walked

a long road with her husband,”

she said. Vinton felt that her cen-
tral dramatic struggle concerns
a “journey in the sense that you
get to a certain point in life and
you expect certain things to hap-
pen, and when they don’t, you
confront that and move on.”

She added that her character is

“not so nice all of the time,” “rid-

Band ‘Quarantines’
musical excellence

Pavement packs a lot of unique style into its new album.

Liz Keeney
Staﬁ” Writer

Pavement

Quarantine the Past: The Best of Pave-
ment

Matador Records

Rocks Like: The Fall, Sonic Youth
Grade: A- g '

It’sbeen nearly a decade since thelast
release from Pavement, so fans of the un-
derground band will be excited to hear
about its newest release, Quarantine the
Past: The Best of Pavement,

Don’t get too excited though, Quar-
antine the Past doesn’t feature any new

.— material from theband. However, it does
. include standards from Pavement’s heyday

in the ’9os.

Released in time to coincide with its
reunion tour, Quarantine the Past is like
a.trip down memory road for Pavement,
considered by some to be one of the most
underrated bands of the i905. With songs
such as “Cut Your Hair” and “Range Life,”
the compilation is reminiscent of the alt-
rock bands gone by. However, Pavement

. manages to gracefully straddle the line be-

tween your average grungy garage band
and its own individual style that is‘ both
intentionally sloppy and clever. Pavement
found its own sound by blending classic
rock, grunge, punk and even balladry, re-
sulting in a unique style.

_ While some might remember Pavement
more for its members’ unconventional per-

_formance.(i.e. drunken Lollapalooza perfor-

mances or drummer Gary Young handing
out cabbage to fans), Pavement has man-
aged to remain musically relevant nearly
10 years after they last took the stage, and
Quarantine the Past shows why.

 

Shearwater album ‘Golden’

Shearwater

Matador Records

Rocks like: Fleet Foxes, Sigur Ros 1
Grade: A-

Some albums seek to define a moment.
Others seek to convey a mood. But The
Golden Archipelago, the latest effort from
the Okkervil River side project Shearwa-
ter, seeks and accomplishes something
entirely unprecedented: to musically en-
capsulate the interaction between men
and islands. . '

At ﬁrst, this goal seems as ridiculous
as it is obscure. But then you begin the
ﬁrst track, and the solemn beauty of this
folk-pop tapestry seizes you. Kicking off
with a rhythmic tribal chorus, the album’s

11 tracks craft an atmosphere-of exquisite
sublimity, bringing to mind sunsets, for-
ests and yes, islands. If this sounds dull,
fear not: Steady percussion, asmart blend
of guitar and piano and the occasional
strings make Shearwater’s opus nothing
less than sonically breathtaking.
Keeping with the band’s transcendental
bent, many lyrics read like a Victorian-

On the surface, this luxury/discount

than the average lot on the racks. The
people who like labels get to stock up
on things they can wear and proudly
say, “It’s Anna Sui.” The designers get
to make some extra cash. '

In actuality, I think everyone loses.
I have never once — really, not once

Play full of raw. emotions

ing her husband throughout the majority
of the play.” Vinton expressed concern that
audiences might not appreciate the nagging
character in the way she hopes.

While at first glance the 650-seat
O’Reilly Theater might seem like it would
thréater1”the"deeply personal setting of
Miller’s play, which takes place in the late
1960s in a Manhattan apartment building

' 2 , E that has been scheduled to be demolished.

Romero said that “the O’Reilly is an inti-
mate theater,” and because “the audience
is around the stage on three sides,” it is a
perfect ﬁt for the emotion expressed in
“The Price.”

In addition to providing an appropriate
atmosphere for Miller’s play, the Pittsburgh
Public Theater was tasked with ﬁnding a
cast able to convey its story and themes
to the audience é not an easy feat as “The
Price” consists of only four parts.

.“You need actors with a lot of experi-
ence,” Romero said, adding, “Every one
of the actors must be able to play a wide
range of emotions.” '

“The biggest challenge for me is to not
yell the entire time. You can’t hit level 10
in the ﬁrst 10 minutes of the play, so it’s
all about modulating the ﬁghts,” Vinton
said. “All of the characters are very raw
emotionally, and there’s lots of anger and
resentment bubbling under the surface. It’s
hard not to let it come out, but you can’t

help it, and it does.”

The four actors cast for the play, an-
chofed by leads Joseph Adams and Sher-
man Howard in the roles of the two feud-
ing Franz brothers, have been seasoned

by work o‘n_P»roadway, in tel_evisi'on and 
in ﬁlm. .
“Comic timing is also necessary because

there aresome very funny parts,” Romero
said, commenting on how the work per-
formed by the actors will not beientirely
stone-faced and serious.

Finding a director for “The Price” also
provided a challenge for the Pittsburgh
Public Theater._ However, the selection of
Tracy Brigden, City Theatre’s artistic di-
rector, for the role was instrumental in
furthering the progress of the production.
Brigden has garnered positions directing
three recent theater productions, in addi-
tion to receiving many honors ‘and acco-
lades, such as being included in Pittsburgh
Magazine’s list of “40 under 40.”

“Tracy Brigden has the patience of a‘

saint,” Vinton said. “She has a very keen
eye for how the play is supposedto move.
What surprised me is how patient she was
and how she let us get muddled occasion-
ally with our characters. She lets you work
the character out.”

era poem. For instance, in the ﬁrst track,
“Meridian,” lead singerjonathan Meiburg
croons, “In the boom and swell from the
waves to the heights/reverberations of our.
old lives.” This sort of epic imagery perme-
ates the entire album, from the aforemen-
tioned lyrics to the album artwork to the
track titles such as “Runners of the Sun”
and “Missing Islands.”

Admittedly, many people might ﬁnd
Shearwater’s Thoreau—like'ruminations a
bit backward or dull. .

By the end ‘of the album, many listeners
might feel that the music’s hypnotic effect
has worn off. But one thing is undeniable:

glected musical territory. Nature lovers

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

 

Thomas, Cole carry limping Panthers

The two juniors have played well for the Pitt women ’s basketball team, especially on the offensive end, despite its recent struggles.’

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

If the Pitt women’s basketball team
is going to succeed in the Big East
tournament, the Panthers need
more performances like the ones
juniors Brittaney Thomas and Chel-
sea Cole turned in against St._]ohn’s
Monday night. ‘

In a season tainted with disap-
pointment, Thomas and Cole pro-

vided two bright spots during the

ﬁnal stretch of games.

In Pitt’s 77-65 loss to St.John’s,
Thomas and Cole were Pitt’s two
biggest standouts. Thomas scored
a career-high 27 points, while Cole
recorded her ﬁfth straight double-
double with 10 points and 16 re-
bounds.

They combined for 15 of Pitt’s
25 ﬁeld goals.

Thomas began a hot streak on
Feb. 15 when she scored 22 points
against Louisville.

“I’ve been talking to Coach and
thinking about a game like this,”
Thomas said after that game. “I
felt like when I got hot, I was re-
ally in the ﬂow of the game. My
teammates and coaches kept tell-
ing me to shoot. I just turned it on

from there.”

‘ Thomas followed up her per-
formance against Louisville with
several other games like that.

After the Louisville game, she
scored 13 points against Villano-
va and Seton Hall and 15 points
against Cincinnati, before closing
the regular season with her career-
high.

“She was really a spark for us
tonight,” Berenatowsaid after the
loss to St. John’s. “She really was
unafraid. She didn’t have any fear
offensively tonight.”

Through Thomas, Pitt has found
a player to step up and take the
critical shots.

Cole started her stretch by scor-
ing 15 points and pulling down 16
rebounds against Villanova. She
followed that performance by
scoring 10 points and grabbing a
career-high 22 rebounds against
Seton Hall.

Against DePaul, Cole scored 12
points and grabbed 18 boards. She
contributed 20 points and 16 re-
bounds against Cincinnati.

“Really, the light just went on
about six games ago,” Berenato
said. “We’re heading to the Big East
tournament, and she’ll continue
her wrath. We’ll hopefully go to the

postseason.”

If the Panthers are going to win
enough games in the Big East tour-
nament to reach the postseason,
they are going to need Cole and
Thomas to continue turning in per-
formances like they have down the
"stretch of the regular season.

However, they will also need
other players to step up.

It’s no coincidence that the best
game Pitt played in the Big East
came when ﬁve players reached
double ﬁgures. _

In that 78-56 victory over Seton
Hall on Feb. 20, Thomas and Cole
both reached double ﬁgures. Ta-
neisha Harrison joined the two
with a game-high 20 points and
Jania Sims and Shayla Scott each
added 10. -

After Pitt’s win over Louisville
on Feb. 14, Pitt head coach Agnus
Berenato said the Panthers needed
to have total team contribution be-
cause they “don’t have Shavonte
Zellous to put up a ton of points,” as
the standout from last year gradu-
ated and is currently playing in the
WNBA.

From that game on, Thomas and
Cole have done their part in con-
tributing. Pitt plays its best when
the other Panthers follow suit.

SOFTBALL

Pitt avoids sweep by winning last game of tournament

After dropping its first three games in the Tar Heel Invitational this past weekend, the Pitt softball team beat Fairﬁeld 14-1.

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt softball team went 1-3 at the Tar
Heel Invitational this weekend as Holly
Stevens and Kristen Cheesebrew earned
all-tournament honors at their second
tournament of the year. .

“We had a tough weekend, but both
[Cheesebrew] and Holly really stepped
up to take the lead,” Pitt head coach Holly
Aprile said. “Holly has come to the plate in
a number of crucial situations offensively,
and she just gets it done.”

In the Panthers’ (3-6) ﬁnal game of the
invitational, Stevens went 4-for-4 at the
plate, tallying ﬁve RBIs and three runs in
Pitt’s 14-1 victory over Fairﬁeld.

It was the first time a Panther drove in
ﬁve runs since Lisa McGregor racked up
ﬁve RBIs against Villanova in 2006.

Stevens, a freshman catcher, took over
for departed senior Sam Card. Card led
the team with 28 RBIs last season and
batted .277.

Aprile said that “losing a seasoned, full-

, time veteran” is difficult, but Stevens has

shown great promise in ﬁlling the role.
“She has a great deal of responsibility

on her shoulders, but she is a fast learn-
er and a tough individual,” Aprile said.
“ [Those are] qualities that are very useful
in the catching position.”

Cheesebrew, who went 2-for-3 with
three runs in the game, batted .538 over
the weekend. At the end of the invitational,
she totaled ﬁve runs, a stolen base and
an RBI.

“At the plate, she has remarkably good
bat control and a hard-nosed attitude,”
Aprile said. “When determination and
hard work meet up with talent, you see
the results in a player like Kristen Cheese-
brew.”

Aprile said that Cheesebrew is also solid
defensively, capable of handling both the
routine and dynamic plays in the ﬁeld.

The team dropped its ﬁrst three games
of the tournament. The first defeat was
a 5-4 loss to Fairﬁeld in extra innings,
despite Cheesebrew’s ﬁrst home run of
the year.

The Panthers scored first in the game,
off Cheesebrew’s homerun and Steven’s
RBI that drove in Reba Tutt. Fairﬁeld tied
the game in the ﬁfth inning, and then both
teams scored in the seventh and eighth
innings. That left the score tied at four
until the Stags scored the winning run

Corey Baker earned his second victory of the season in Pitt’s ﬁrst win of the weekend.

Alex Oltmanns A

Staﬁ‘ Writer

The Pitt baseball team continued its early season
success by sweeping all three of its games in the
Armed Services Classic in Memphis, Tenn., this
past weekend to improve to 5-1.

Led by junior pitcher Corey Baker’s strong
performance on the mound, the Panthers won
a3—2 game againstBradley on Friday He allowed

justtwo runs on seven hitswith nowalks andfour
strikeouts in 7.2 innings of work.

Pitt was being shut out through the ﬁrst four
innings butbroke outforathree-runﬁfthinning.

Juniorthirdbasemanjoe Leonard knocked intwo
runs whﬂe catcher Cory Brownsten ﬁnished the
game 3-for-4.

In the second game of the series, Pitt needed
another big inning to win. Trailing 8-5 going into
the ninth, the Panthers led offthe inningwithback—
to-back singles byjohn Schultz and Leonard, who
came around to score with one out after :1 Travis

Whitmore triple to cutthe score to 8-7.

A Phil Konieczny ﬁelder’s choice to third
brought Whitmore home to tie the game ,and
Konieczny reached second on a wild pitch. Two
batters later, Kevan Smith singled home the go-
ahead runandPitt keptthe Tigers offthe board in
the bottom of the inningto preserve the win.

Leonard, with three hits, andwhitmore, with

runs and collected three RBIs.

In the ﬁnal game, Pitt blew by Toledo 11-3.
Leonard continued his hot hiuing with two more
hits andRBIs onhiswaytobeingnamedtourna—
ment MVP. Danny Lopez had three hits whereas

Rodgers and Cheesebrew hit consecutive
singles but were left stranded.

O’Connell gave up three hits and struck
out six. ‘’

Berliner pitched all ﬁve innings of Pitt’s
victory over Fairﬁeld. She allowed one run
and three hits.

“The pitcher’s job is to keep the game
in striking distance for the offense and
for the most part, we have done that,”
Aprile said.

However, she added that she would like
to see the Panther pitchers cut down on
walks. In Pitt’s four games in the invita-
tional, Panther pitchers issued a total of
12 walks. »

Overall, Aprile said she thought the
team did a good job of battling back when
they fell behind, but she said their offense
still needs work.

“We need to continue to improve on
offense with both our execution and our
ability to put the ball in play,” Aprile said.
“Situational hitting is a huge key for us.”

Next, the Panthers travel to Morehead,
Ky., for the Morehead State Invitational
March 6-7. Pitt will face Morehead State,
Oakland and Indiana University-Purdue
University.

All curious to see who drafts Tim Tebow

With the.NFL Draft less than two months away, ESPN.com is here to help answer mcm’s most pressing question.

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Everyone has questions they think about
constantly — some of .which they might
never know the answer to.

Questions like, “Whats the meaning of
life?” and “Where do babies come from?”
are among these. ' V

Numerous people have hypothesized the
answers to all of those questions through-
out history, but how can anyoneanswer any
of them accurately? ‘

N ow, we have one more great, important

‘question to join the ranks along some of

life’s greatest mysteries:

Which team will pick Tim Tebow in the
NFL Draft? ' ' ‘

But unlike some of the other great won-
ders of the world, we’ll ﬁnd out the answer
to this question when the draft takes place
April 22-24. We’ll probably ﬁnd out earlier
rather than "later, as April 22 is when the
ﬁrst round takes place, and it would be
near-sacrilegious not to draft Tebow in the
ﬁrst round.‘Though since you can’t predict
any drafts, the second and third rounds
take place April 23 whereas rounds 4-7’

are on April 24. A _
Tim Tebow ——- for those who don’t know

0 —— is the former quarterback at Florida.

There, he won two national championships,
became the ﬁrst sophomloreto win the
Heisman trophy, currently holds numer-
ous SEC records and spent one offseason
circumcising children in the Philippines.

Clearly, the NFL isn’t getting,just a quar-'

he throws, and his passes aren’t the most
accurate or well thrown.

Yet football fans are on the collective
edges of their seats waiting to see which
team drafts Tebow — some undoubtedly
because they’re hoping the teams they root
for aren’t that team. ‘

Knowing this, ESPN.com’ unleashed
something yesterday so great,'so amaz-

 

Yet football fans are on the collective edges of their seats wait-
ing to see which team drafts Tebow -—— some undoubtedly because
they’re hoping the teams they root for aren’t that team.

terback —— it’s getting an exemplary hu-
man being. _ .

Even with all his success in college,
many people don’t think he’ll be effective

in the NFL. Sure, he hardly took any snaps _

under center while in college and showed
difficulty doing so in Senior Bowl practice
-— and yes, he has a long windup before

ing that it needs to be read by all footbal
fans. "

Yesterday, at 11:37 a.m., ESPN uploaded
on its NFL Nation blog a comprehensive ar-
ticle called “Where Will Tim Tebow Land?-”
The article lists all 32 teams and their “draft
probability” of selecting Tebow, ranging
from “no chance” to “medium.”

According to the ESPN.com staff, 16 of
the NFL’s 32 teams rank “low” under “draft
probability,” 10 rank “medium,” ﬁve are
given “no chance,” and only the Houston

Texans arethought to have a “super low” =

chance of drafting Tebow.

It doesn’t end there. ESPN.com also has
‘a blog for each of the NFL’s eight divisions.
The writers of those blogs also wrote ar-
ticles breaking down the likelihood that
Tebow will end up on one of the teams in
their respective divisions. Yes, there are
eight articles about where Tebow will land
built around one list ranking the prob-
ability, of someone drafting him. He is,
of course, the only draft prospect getting
nearly this much coverage on ESPN.com at

an

the moment — and rightfully so because’ l

he’s so great. -

So, football fans, we can only hope that
as the draft nears ESPN, its army of Tebow
draft stock writers will continue to update
its master list. I know I planon checking
it regularly, and I assume as April 22 gets
closer, most teams’ “draft probability” will
increase as they all see why drafting Tebow
would be a great move. Of course, it could
also go the other way.

If it does, at least there will always be
children to circumcise.
