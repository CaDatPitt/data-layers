BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Student Government Board

(SGB) President Larry Platt said-
Friday his administration is explor- ~

ing more effective ways of
representing students—possibly

through unionization—and that

broader-abased student support is
necessary to combat arbitrary
decisions made by the University.

At a press conference in David

‘Lawrence Hall, his first since he
_,_was elected in January, Platt said

he saw a division between the kinds
of policies on which Student
Government can now have impact
and those on which it cannot.
“Those issues which directly
affect the financial status of the
University are the type students

, have the least input toward,” Platt

said. “Student government power
at this point is minimal in
combatting those kind of things.
“The only way to increase our
inﬂuence, besides bringing law-
suits against Pitt based on the

Sunshine Law, is to build a power ,

base of organized -students to

the state legislature." _
The Sunshine Law opened
public-agency hearings to the

‘ public.

Platt said the present SGB
leadership is only. as strong on

ﬁnancially .related issues as the
student base from which it
operates. In the current absence of
this student power base, he noted,
“We’re not very strong."

Platt added that the SGB is
gathering information on the
building of student power bases at
other universities and perhaps

_7;a.,.,,would use them for models here at
i‘-wt’ Pitt.

‘One of the methods he cited as
being under consideration at- other
schools is the unionization of
student bodies. When asked if he

thought_a union of students. would
work at Pitt, Platt answered: ‘‘I’m
not too sure it would.”

Platt answered in the affirmative
when asked if he believed the
University had a tendency to make
arbitrary decisions over the heads

of students, such as in the recent’

coupon-exchange controversy and
the relocation, of the Towers’
pinball machines. He offered two
methods of reversing the trend.
“Pressure has to be kept up in
the Pitt News and "the students
must write letters to the legisla-

BY BRIAN DUNN

Philadelphia state legislators
have much "more inﬂuence on
Pennsylvania appropriations deci-
sions than do their _Western
Pennsylvania counterparts, House
‘Majority Leader K. Leroy Irvis said
here Friday.

Speaking to a political science
class in the Cathedral, Irvis also
defended the size ,of the. state
legislature, often criticized _for
being bloated and unwieldy.

“We are by no means as
cohesive a group as the legislators
from Philadelphia,” he said,
“because there’s no coalition-
consciousness among Western
Pennsylvania legislators. ' .

“We’_ve tried to correct that

situation, but we’ve,'failed,” he‘-_

tors regularly," he said. “And,
number two, we’ve got to develop a
broader-based support among stu-
dents.” . .
Platt noted the SGB had received,
strong support from the student
body during the coupon contro-
versy, but said the University “had
to save face once it decided there
was a problem with student
seating‘ for this season’s home
football games. -
“They (the administrators in-
volved) maintained we had a
problem and we couldn't convince
them otherwise,” Platt said.
“They; came to .that conclusion
completely without student input.

“Given proper participation in '

the formulation of policy, we
would’ve been able to convince the
administration no problem ex-
isted."

Platt also said student support
for the SGB rests heavily on the Pitt
News’ ability to adequately explain
what the Board is trying to do.
After this is done, he said, it
depends on whether students

money because “they have trem-
endous problems.” He also said
Philadelphians more readily unite
because they see‘ themselves as
constantly under attack from rural

legislators who are “anti-big city.”'

The House currently has 203
members, each ofvwhom represents
approximately 57,000 people.

He said a move to enlarge each
constituency to 150,000 people
would result in districts as large as
100 by 35 miles. ‘

“Are you not reducing the
chance of people getting to
communicate with their legisla-
tors?” Irvis asked.

He said a cut in the size of the
legislature also would increase the
chances of corruption. He made an
obvious reference to two recently

  

Optional Grade Policy

An|"|0Lmced for Winter

BY CONNIE GIEL

The University officially will
adopt a new grading policy next
term, Assistant to the Provost Ray
Steele said recently. The policy
guidelines will be announced
following final modiﬁcations and
approval by the individual schools,
and will go into effect January 1.

‘ A tentatively adopted outline of
the policy was released in the
winter-term time schedule two
weeksago.

Steele said the deans of the 20
schools within the University had
accepted a new grading policy last
January. The plan was undertaken
to‘ make grade policy options
available to all parts of the
University, heiadded.

Since the initial deliberations,-

the policy has been revised several
times to make it acceptable to the
diverse faculties within each school
and department. - -

' “The bulletin containing grade
descriptions will be inaccurate for a
while,” Steele said. He explained
that the schedules had to be

‘ printed before the final policy was

decided upon, but the guidelines
given in the schedule are funda-
mentally correct.

Pitt has no absolute "standard
grading system, Steele said. There
are, however, standardized defini-
tions of grades.

“An ‘A’ in_ Engineering equals
an ‘A’ in biology,” Steele said.
“We make no distinctions of that
kind.” ,

He said a new grading policy was
needed to make University records,
especially student transcripts, con-
sistent. “The whole point of
keeping records is to use them
later,” Steele said.— “Hopefully,
this policy will get the University
records. into a system that will
accurately report what must be

' reported.”

Once the policy is implemented ,
' at the schools, students’ grade

transcripts will be more manage-
able and accurate, he added.

The University will establish
broad parameters, but each school
is free to set its own limits within
those parameters. The school’s
policy, if consistent with . the
University’s will override individ-
ual departmental policies.-

’ “Many schools have made some
modifications in terminology,”
Steele said. “But not necessarily
their policy of ‘determining
grades.” -

For example, a school may have P

offered both’ Pass/ Fail and Satis-
factory/Unsatisfactory. . “There's
not a whole lot of difference, so we

suggested the ‘school adopt one or , ‘V Z‘ 1“

the other,” Steele -said. -

Twenty-four different grades will I"

be offered, as well as six additional
options. _ ‘

Standard A,B,C,D andiF ldesuig.-~ 1. ’ "

nations may be offered with “plus”
or “minus” modifications.
and “I” will indicate incomplete
work. “W” as before, will mean
withdrawal. Grade. designations
offered for the ﬁrst time will be
“H,” honors; “Q,” qualiﬁed;
“K,” competent; “N,” audit; and
“NE,” no entry. ‘

SIG!’ -, 

The new grade options available H‘

For
will

are combinations of these.
instance, “H”/“K”/“U”

indicate that a course was taken for V

honors, competent or unsatisfact-
ory designations. . -
Students may choose any option

_approved by the school, depart-

ment and faculty member teaching
the course. The time schedule

warns, however, that once made,
the decision to take a course on a.
grading option basis cannot be
changed. A grade of oneqsystem
cannot be changed to a grade ‘of
another systemwithout the approv-
al of the school’s dean.

as viable ways of_ promoting

. ,g.‘c.hange.

' 7 When pressed to say if he was
getting enough support from his six
fellow SGB members, Platt ap-
peared ambivalent.

“I'm being backed up On many
of the things I'm doing," he said.
“As to whether all Board members
are doing as much as they can, I
don't think they are."

Platt said members of the’Board
who had not worked as hard as
expected were berated publicly at
the open SGB meetings-and that
one (Steve Tarnock) was asked to
resign during the summer.

He also announced a new

,/“‘F'.x,tudent Government proposal call-

~ Ilig for the standardization of
academic course descriptions, .

The proposed standardization, to
be presented to the Provost at
tOday’s Senate Council meeting,
includes the listing of purposes and
objectives of the courses, together
with books required, and the
criteria for the determination of
grades. '

“There will be no change, really,
in the format of the course
description,” Platt explained.
“We're just trying to standardize it
and ensure that every professor
teaching a course provides all
relevant infOrmation."p

Platt said faculty members

).i<.§JlIould be forced to comply with the
' standardized format, but hoped
that step wouldn’t be necessary.

Ideally, according to Platt, if
faculty members didn't supply all
necessary information in course
descriptions. it would be evident to
students who noticed .the absence‘
of data in certain categories, and

resultant pressure would force
them to comply.

On the issue of the possible
formation of an undergraduate
student employes union. Platt said.
"After receiving several employe
complaints. I have suggested we
begin to think of how student
workers are being treated at the
University. ‘

“We can approach the problem
in two ways: We can develop a set
of regulations of how the University
can treat student employes, Or the
more extreme measure would be
for students to unionize'."'

Asked to view the job he and the
rest of the SGB have done this
year, Platt responded that his

administration has been very active
in isolating and working on

problems. with a special ‘emphasis .

on consumerism.
“I think we’ve been active and

successful except with the crises.

we weren’t prepared for," he said.

“When the University hit us with
sudden decisions we couldn't
prepare for, we were not success-

' ful.

“We've isolated 12 to 15 major
issues this year and we've been
working on’them all along. We
may not finish them all this year.
but next year's _Student Govern-
ment will be able to‘ pick up the
issues where we left Off right

Making the Best Choice

. The proposal by Student Government, Board (SGB) President Iarry
Plart that all course requirements be listed publicly -before registration
is one that deserves much consideration.

Such a comprehensive listing should ‘include ‘not only course
prerequisites, ‘purposes and objectives, but also the means for
evaluation, the type of assignments given, and the required textbooks.

~ Though a student may not decide to drop a course just because of the
text used, it is helpful to know what type of book one is expected, to use
the next term. _

Some course descriptions, particularly those for literature courses,
have a bad habit of leaving "it up to the instructor to decide
.“eventually"' which bool$ to use. '

When the description says the “great novels of the period will be

‘ examined,” does this mean ﬁve books or 10? Does this mean books the

size of Hemingway's 'Ihe‘0ld Man and the Sea, a scant 125 pages, or
books more along the line of the 400-page For Whom the Bell Tolls?
' Sure, the credit load is detemiined by the amount of time put in each
week, but everyone knows some three-credit courses demand twice as ‘
much work as others, and apart from that, the difﬁculty of the work
depends on the student. - ‘
Platt’s call for a more complete course deﬁnition is _certainly not
without good cause. It's ‘questionable that there would be fewer

I add/ drops under an expanded course description, but it’s foolish to

predict there’d be more. _ .

When professors complain that there is not enough time to decide on
‘texts, assignments and means of evaluation before the next term’s
course descriptions go to press, the impression arises’ that they see.
their roles as instructors in a term-to-term basis, rather than as a part
of an evolving didacticism. ' .

If students are expected to plan their terms in succession while
keeping an-eye on the overall pattern, it stands to reason that educators
should be able to provide them with the means to do it. Afterall, the
great majority of courses scheduled for next term already have been
offered, so it’s not as if professors were starting from’ scratch.

A more complete course description also would save students that
great shock on the ﬁrst day in the bookstore when every course is seen ~

'

YC’s bright side‘

V" explore students’

in terms of dollars and cents. . A ,
Registering for a course without knowing all the facts is like signing

.up for a trip to a foreign country and ﬁnding out when you get there

that you have a series of innoculations to undergo ‘and that your money

has been devalued.

A comprehensive course-description catalog would be able to show I
students what kind of trip they’re embarking on, long before they. even

set foot on the boat.

  Being Served?

It is hardly possible to pick up a
‘copy of the Pitt News anymore
without reading an editorial or

_guest column attacking labor,»

unions. Striking musicians, federal
employes and various other
workers come in for their share of
abuse, but the main editorial ﬁre is
concentrated on the unionization
drive here at Pitt. Intentionally or

‘not, the authors of these attacks Q
perform valuable dirty work for the _
I - Pitt administration by attempting

to divide students and faculty
‘unionists. In doing this, the Pitt
News has promulgated a number of
myths about faculty unionization at
Pitt. Let us take a closer look at
these myths.

Myth #1: FACULTY UNIONI-
ZATION WILL HURT STUDENTS.
Thefacts show otherwise. The
campus unions- oppose tuition
increases and the AFL-CIO repre-

sentative on the Board of Trustees.

was the ONLY member to vote
against the last hike. The labor’
movement has consistently favored
quality education in the universi-
ties, and low tuition rates to make

' this education‘ accessible to all.

Unions at Pitt will ﬁght the
administration’s drive ‘to have
fewer faculty members teach larger
and larger classes. And at least
one union has written to the
Student Government Board to
role in the
‘collective bargaining process_.

Myth #2: PITT IS ONE BIG

‘HAPPY FAMILY AND THE

UNIONS WILLCHANGE THAT.

__ In reality all major decisions are

made by the Board of Trustees and
the administration.

For instance, take the, latest
tuition hike. ' Did "students or
faculty have a voice in this
decision? «How about ‘faculty

Pitt’s “happy family.” The PPU
has proposed an excellent afﬁrma-,

American Federation of Teachers

Myth #3: ‘FACULTY ARE

PROFESSIONALS WHO DON'T '

professionals. This does not
logically mean, however, that they
have no need of unions;

Professionals must eat too, and the
salaries paid to faculty members at

Pitt are now below those earned by .

the unionized faculty at Slippery
Rock or Lock Haven State Colleges.
The salaries of the teachers at Pitt,
are wretched by any standards.

The “productivity drive” of the
State Legislature is a slap in the
face of any qualiﬁed teaching
employe. The yearly budget cuts,
in which the administration either

are a direct‘ threat to professional

departments. 11;. faculty are to

conditions in the 1970s (or, in the
case of part-timers and the
graduate employes, to gain them).
they must turn to unionization.

Students at Pitt should support
faculty unionization, as it is in our
interests to do so. The aforemen-
tioned Pitt News articles serve no
one's interests but the administra-
tion. ‘ '

I'm in favor of "Human Sex”
and I can't seem to get it in this

university. I'm referring to
Current Problems 16, “Human
Sexuality."

I am going into. my last term
here. I've» been’ trying to get
Human Sex ever since they started
offering it," and I got shut out every
time. But‘ since I could register on
the very ﬁrst day of registration
this time, Iﬁgured I could get that
course without any problem. So,
after seeing myladvisor, I went

" over to the Health Center Business

Ofﬁce to get my permission slip
for the course. The lady there’ told

me that the course had closed for-

senior females half an hour ago, at
10:30.

Apparently, they want an equal
quota from each sex and age group
to ﬁll this course. I don't think
that's fair. At least if this course
operated like all the others, seniors
would get preference. Maybe the
sophomores and juniors would
have to wait till senior year to take
it. but that's OK. I waited. . f

And 1 got screwed. I'll never get '
to have Human Sex now, and that's

"a shame. because I had a lot to

contribute to that class. You see,

’ Further,

fervor, the country seems to be
losing sight of the gravity of the
situation, especially if New York is
allowed to default. President Ford
seems to think that defaulting
would teach the City a lesson and
set an example for all those ‘other

*municipalities that operate in the.

red. -

The solution, the President
believes, is to declare New York
bankrupt and a ward of the court
and to force the City to balance its
budgetiand cut down on spending
in such areas as welfare, City
services and municipal employe
pensions. In short, the same
“tightening of the belt” policy that
has been failing since Ford took
office.

To Pittsburghers, the" idea of a
city defaulting must seem strange.
Their own city budget is supposed
to have a $5.8 million surplus this
year. But one only has to drive the
City's streets to see how that‘
money has been saved; Pittsburgh
potholes are almost legendary.
Pittsburghers suffer
through poor public transportation,
inadequate social services and
rising utility costs. Still, there is
that $5.8 million surplus, whatever
good it does anyone.

While the social services in New
York are nowhere near perfect,
there is an attempt to provide the
City's citizens with a wider range of
services than any in other major
U.S. city. New Yorkers, for
example, get free water. And
while the city college system is
certainly not the best educational
system in the world, the philosophy
that a free education should be
available ‘to all is not a scandalous
one. Finally, the City supports a
host of other public services,
ranging from the free library to the
American Museum of Natural
History. '

In Ford's mind, and indeed, in
the mind of most people in the
country, these are excesses that
could be either ' reduced or
eliminated entirely from the City
budget. They are not just services,
.but the fat that has helped make
New Yorkers the "fat snobs
everyone considers them, a sign of

. - decaying times. And like any true
I country boy, Ford dribbles glee-

fully as the biggest of the big
stumbles. I

The case for saving New'York is
a good one, but the first ‘and most
important point is that the problem
of the City's default is really the

Another reason why federal aid
is desirable is that Ford's plan not
only ignores the problems and
complexities of New York, but also
could wind up costing the federal
treasury more than a plan for
federal assistance because of the

Since the P1anetarium’s first
exhibit, 22 years ago, Bowdish has
designed the railroad and personal-
ly hand-crafted the buildings,
animations and special scenic

remarked, “He’s our main man.
"Without him we don't have
anything.” ’

In June, Buhl’s technicians start

' to build the exhibit’s framework,

and the controls for the six trains,
boats, lighting and special effects

are installed. The train track is laid -

by September and placement of the
buildings and the animations
begins. ‘

One technician grimaced about
his work and said, “It’s built from

its place, one thing at a time. It’s
taken us ﬁve months to -put it
together. We started it in June;

Frank Zappa Smashes Myth

BY JAMES SPARK

“You’re going to see whom?”

* guy with the double-decker mous-

tache. ’ ’

“You must be crazy man, it’s a

1 total waste of money to see Zappa

live. His band’s a studio group.
Stinks in concert!”

But after seeing Zappa live at the
Arena‘, I reached the conclusion
that Frank Zappa and the Mothers
are deﬁnitely not a studio group,
tied to their tape recorders by an
inability to improvise.

Zappa had brought his sidekick
Captain Beefheart, a sax player, a
drummer, abassistand a keyboard
player. They opened the night with
an unusual version of “Stink
Foot,” complete with a “$1.99
variety stuffed puppy” to play the
part of Fido. The band’s use of
visuals cancelled out the rougher
texture of the music as compared to

Throughout the whole show,
Zappa soloed fantastically on his
pair of guitars, doing a lot of
material not on any of his LPs. His

/

guitarwork was probably the high

standing ovations were as common
as cow patties in Wyoming.

Fortunately, an encore was
forthcoming, which culminated
when the “Grand Wazoo” himself
explained that he “had to go.”
The show contained a lot of visual
material that won’t translate onto a

So, who says Zappa’s band is.

Despite Strike, Pgh.
Symphony Plays On

BY PAMELA EUSI

You might think a concert given
by a striking symphony would have
a sparse crowd in attendance.
Friday night undermined this
theory. The remnants of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
gave their second free concert since
striking on September 28. Pitts-
burgh is literally symphony-starved
——-so far four symphony concerts,
two ballets and one opera have
been either cancelled or postponed.

Wielding the baton at the concert

"was principal flutist, Bernard

Goldberg. The strong and forceful
style in his cues and downbeats
begged for feeling from certain
sections. a

The Carnival Overture, Opus 92
by Anton Dvorak was the first work‘
of the program. From the opening
notes you were immediately caught
up in thislively festival of sounds‘
and musical colors. After a brief
introduction of the main theme by
the entire orchestra, an exciting
oboe solo vibrated as the theme‘
passed from section to section. A
tender string melody, later echoed
by the woodwinds, led into an

‘ interlude emphasizing the percus-

sion section through its use of
strong rhythms, tambourines and
castanets;

A short pastoral setting, empha-
sized by the call of a ﬂute and a
violin solo, remained somber
through the low throbbing of the
string basses and cellos. Sudden
life appeared in the contrasting

- string parts and bold brass tones.

The trombone sectionled the way
to a recap of the festive opening
moods.

- In this last part, the orchestra at
several points almost ran away with
the piece and the conductor.

Finally the frenzy cooled off in a —

long ﬁnale containing stirring
downbows of the strings alternat-
ing with blasts from the brass.
Charmian Gadd, famous violin-
ist, soloed with Finnish composer
Jean Sibelius’ Concerto in D Minor
for Violin and Orchestra, Opus 47.
Sibelius lived until 1957 and his
works are somewhere between the
old and 'the modern, with an
individual ﬂair that sets them apart
from others of the same period.

Muted strings began the piece
and set the mood for the haunting
violin solo to follow. Initially,
clarinets and bassoons, cellos and
bassesadded a dreary background
to the capers of the violin. An
English horn solo paved the way for
a free, wild solo section, with‘Gadd
waltzing and dancing her way
between the viola accompaniment.

After various ominous-sounding
orchestral‘ chords, the soloist

challenged the orchestra in slides‘

and string crossings until she
earned her victory through a
superb solo without any orchestral
accompaniment.

Gadd seemed a bit unsure of

herself in -the higher notes and 

some sounded really ﬂat. But she
ramblings
down the scale with the tumbling
speed of a waterfall. .
A sorrowful solo part illuminated
with French horns and eerie
trumpet chords provided ‘what
seemed like a background to the
orchestral parts. This solo part
developed until it came quietly and
peacefully to a slow ﬁnish.
Suddenly galloping, challenging
string sections led the solo into
what was probably’ Gadd’s most
effective playing of the concert.
Keeping up with the nervous

~ energy of the orchestral back-

ground and performing the ex-
tremely technical violin solo, Gadd
astounded the audience in her
combination of very high (near the
bridge) notes, tricky rhythms and
toying_with the brass section.

After, intermission, a standard
orchestral piece, Tschaikovsky’s
Symphony No. 5 in E Minor, Opus
64, was performed.

The highlight of this symphony
came in the second movement, in
which the French horn played what
is perhaps the most beautiful,
lyrical solo ever written for this
instrument.-Quite a few years ago,
someone used this melody as the
tune for a pop song entitled “Moon
Love." _

’ After hearing both versions, you
can’t help but ask yourself why
anyone felt the need to create lyrics
for this melody. Its message came
across loud and clear without the
use of popular poetry to muddy the
music. ' .

  Awaiting Recognition

BY RALPH SPARKLE

The Pitt cross-country team
defeated Penn State last Friday at
.Schenley Park by the score of
27-29. .
The win was no ﬂuke for the
young Panthers. Underrated and
unnoticed early in the season, the
Pitt team went on tolbeat all its
opponents, except, in its only
three-cornered ‘competition, 3rd-
ranked Michigan.
Penn State’s Coach Harry
Groves, commenting on Pitt’s
performance, said, “Pitt ran very
well. They were in trouble in the
4th and 5th mile,
themselves together and won.
They showed a lot of poise and
determination. Sometimes I- think
we (Penn State) are overrated.”

A Senior Nick Martin won the fast
6‘/4-mile race in 30:33, breaking his
own record set earlier this year.
The ﬁrst four home all beat the
previous record, but team perfor-

. mance is what counts.

Martin and Mel Boyd ran on the
heels of Penn State's Paul Stemmer
and George Malley throughout the
ﬁrst part of the race. After ﬁve
miles, however, Martin opened up
a big lead and ﬁnished well ahead
of the two Lions, who just managed

but pulled “

. in dual meets.

The Pantherette volleyball team
edged up in ‘the race for the
regionals by taking the tri-meet at
lndiana University (of Pennsylvan-
ia) on Friday night.

Pitt had an easy time with the
home team, winning 15-9, and
15-2. Although IUP was responsi-
ble for a notch in the Pantherettes’
loss column last year, Edinboro
gave the real competition.

Edinboro won the ﬁrst game
15-4, but the Pantherettes forced a
split with the second, 15-10, and
then took it all with an 11-8 win.

“They (Edinboro) are probably
the toughest team we've played,"
said- Pantherette Coach Mary
Kromer.

T helregionals bid is expected
sometime before the ﬁnaL,game
next Monday.

The Pitt Hockey Club will
present “Score-0” on Wednesday.
at noon on the Student Union
Porch. The object of the game is to
score on a Pitt goalie. Three shots
are 25 cents. Tickets to the Pitt

. Hockey Invitational can be:won by
dlgo-"m'p‘-etVi‘n"g.I"d'lOl.>I>o‘IO1l':t-II‘!Vivvvh‘

to keep Boyd in 4th place.

Although the race was unusually

hard, Terry Wile, Dave McDonald,

Bob Lee and Ron Wirick ran
exceptionally well and were vital to
Pitt’s win. Wile and McDonald,
running together on the last half of

the race,.split up PSU’s tight pack

and"ﬁnish'ed 6th'and 7th respec-

tively.

The meet was still in the balance
after the ﬁrst eight finishers. With
Pitt needing the next-place ﬁnisher

to win, Lee and Wirick sprinted

down the , ‘home stretch, thus
clinching the victory. '
.“Everyone ran their personal
record for the distance and gave
110% effort,” said Head Coach
Mike Agostinella. .,“We have a
very young team this season. and
should be tough next year.
“Penn State had very formidable
credentials which got them their
national’ ranking, but when‘ you

-beat quality teams, the NCAA has
to notice.

Then we'll get our
invitation to the National Champ-
ionship.” -

The Panthers have a 6-0 record

Morgantown, W. Va...How long
does it take to destroy a year’s
work?‘ How long to dash
somebody’s hope for an outstand-

a ing season? How long to shatter a

dream?

If your name is Bill McKenzie
and you play football for the West
Virginia Mountaineers, it ' takes
four seconds. The walk-on
sophomore from Warwood, sW.
Va., took just that much time on
Saturday to boot a 38-yard ﬁeld

goal and give the Mounties a '

stunning 17-14 win.
Actually the game very\well

Booters

Bow to C
Mounties

As you probably know, last week
was .“l\/Iountaineer Week” in West
Virginia. Well, the West Virginia
soccer team created a 1-0 lead in
the second half, and that mountain

_-was too large for the Pitt Panthers
to scale, as the Mountaineers held
on for a 1-0 victory.

After_ a. stalemated ﬁrst half,
West Virginia’s offense exploded.
The Mountaineers ﬁred 30. total

shots on goal, compared to the 
r paltry two‘shots- Pitt got.

But
most of those shots were from long

range, and it appeared that the
game would end tied.

"That was not to be‘ the case.

Midway through the second half,

John Colombo won it for the"

Mountaineers, who won their 7th
game of the season.‘ Pitt’s recor
fell to 5-6-2. -

The Panthers must win their
ﬁnal_game at Penn State if they
have any hope of ﬁnishing with an
even season.

But Penn State is a pretty big 2.

mountain. to climb.

‘Monday, November 10, 1975%THE PITT NEWS—Page 7. r

 WVU Shatte Panther Dream, 17-14 3

could have been divided into two
equal parts. The first half was all
defense, with Pitt’s deepest pene-
tration to the West Virginia 38 and
the Mountaineers’ to the Panther
47. '

In the second half, both teams
took turns marching up and down
the ﬁeld as if defense had gone out
of style. ~ '

West Virginia was the ﬁrst to
tally, scoring on the second
possession of the half. After ‘a
10-play effort to open the half
produced nothing but a fumble by
Mounties quarterback Danny
Williams, the Panthers had a ﬁrst
and 10 at their own ﬁve. Two plays
later, it was WVU’s ball again
when Tony Dorsett fumbled into
the hands of linebacker Ray
Marshall on the_16.

Then eight plays later, fullback
Ron Lee bulled in, and McKenzie
made the score 7-0. v

The Panthers came back to open
the 4th quarter. With a ﬁrst and '10
on the West Virginia 28, quarter-
back Matt Cavanaugh dropped
back and hit. “the man with the
hands,” Gordon Jones, who

brought the ball down between two A 

players for the six-pointer.

The Mounties came right back
following the tying score.
WVU’s other quarterback, Danny
Kendra, the hill folk got to the
Panther 23. From there it was all
up to “King” Arthur Owens. ,
Getting 23 of his 101 yards for the
day, the all-time leading rusher in '-
West Virginia history danced’ his
way into the end zone and the

hearts of his fans, giving the 

hometown team a seven-point lead.
Pitt, not to be outdone-—at least
not yet—came right back on a

nine-yard pass play, Cavanaugh "to . ..

Dorsett, and the score was knotted

‘ at 14 with 7:55 left in the ball game.

Again the Mounties seemed

destined to score, until a fumble by 

With ,

Ron Lee gave the ball back to the "

Panthers with 57 seconds left. _
’ Larry ‘Swider’s punt gave the *

Mounties the ball on Pitt’s 48, from- ‘

where Kendra hit tight end Randy
Swinson for 26 yards before-

McKenzie played hero for the »

crowd. « _ .
Four seconds can ruin a lot of

dreams. .

You can sometimes control the
direction of the ball by where it

hits your paddle. If it hits the
center it will go straight. A

If it hits the right edge,

it will go right,
etc. Flicking the
paddle to get a spin
might work but

is less controlled.

Avoid the sharp angle shots s-ince
they tend to slow the ball and

his line
of play.

AND‘ THEN . . .
PRACTICE

UP WHERE
YOU SEE

P mzs SIGN.

are easy to return. The most ef-
fective angle shots are those that rebound
closest to your opponent, the deadliest be-
ing the shot that rebounds just as it hits

Shots down the middle are bor- '
ing and slow. However, late in
‘ the rally after the ball has speed-
ed up, a middle shot can
be a killer if used de-
liberately to surprise
your opponent.
