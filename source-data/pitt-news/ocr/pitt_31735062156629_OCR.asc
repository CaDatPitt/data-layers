SEND THE BAND’ DRIVE LAGS

Over $2100 Yet Needed
As Deadline Nears  

With a final deadline of noon Monday, Oct. 30, set for contri
butions to the ‘Send the Band to Notre Dame’ fund, fraternity men
yesterday gathered in $249.84 toward the $2500 goal.

A score of the fratmen circulated about campus all day with

improvised collection boxes, collecting everything from pennies

to $10 checks. Organized by Interfraternity Council, teams of

men from each of the participating fraternities will plug the cam-

paign all week.

Although several fraternities de-
clined to participate actively in
the campaign, reports that the
drive was being sabotaged were
evidently without foundation, al-

Biddle Backs SC in Ban

Promises
Probe Soon

"Violators of University drink-
ing regulations will be prosecuted
as they have been in fl" past,”
Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle
‘said today in a statement con-
cerning Student Congress’ recent-
ly-proposed Stadium drinking
ban.

The dean's statement was
first University comment

the

on the

_liquor is sue.

The SC drinking ban came as a
result of a note sent to SC Decorum
Committee chairman, Andy Schurman,
by Capt. Tom Hamilton, athletic
director, who suggested that "drink-
ing and rowdyism” during football
games be dealt with at once. Don
Ewart, SC representative to the Uni-
versity athletic C0ﬂ1I11itt€€.,had pre-
viously suggested that “-some means,
such as student proctors," be pro-
vided to insure that no intoxicants
be brought into the stadium.

SC Policy Reversed

Ina reversal of Congress’ original

«policy, Andy Schurman said, “We
 of the Decorum Committee cannot
ghope to eliminate drinking in the
 stadium, but we do hope to put down
: bottle throwing and rowdyness and
 make whatever drinking there is re-
, spectab le.”

Schurman said he observed con-
sidernble drinking and throwing of

. beer cans and liquor bottles clogging

the passageways in Section 16 during
the ' Pitt—Rice game. Schurman,

in the Panther costume,

my tail.” There was "much distur-
bance and drurks running around
everywhere,” he added.

Investigation Promised

Inhis statement Dean Biddle said:
"I will‘ investigate this alleged
drinking by students in the stadium.
If conditions are as bad as some
say, University action will be taken.”

"It was reported last year that
there was drinking in the student
section at football games and con-
sideration was given of this fact,”
Dean- Biddle said.

"Students were disciplined at the
time; however, the individuals and
the discipline involved were not
publicized in consideration of the
students concerned,” he added.

"It is contrary to University regu-
lations for alcoholic beverages to
be consumed at University events.
This regulation is applicable to stu-
dents at football games,” Dean
Biddle concluded. "Good student
citizens appreciate the wisdom of
this rule and cooperate accordingly.”

Miami Promises
Flavor to Homecoming

Dixie

A bitofthe Old South will find its way into Pitt Stadium during
the Homecoming game with Miami on Oct. 28.

According to Ben Grady, advisor to the student cheering sec-
tion, the Miami Chamber of Commerce is sending several crates

of Florida oranges and other deli-
cacies to the game. ,.

The entire Homecoming program
will be made more colorful by the
Miami varsity band -- reputed to be
the showiest in the South. Who will
get the oranges is a question not
yet decided.

The night before the game there
will be a torchlight rally on the
Bellefield side of the campus. Im-
mediately after the rally, all frat-
ernities will hold open house for
tha alumni.

Interest in the Homecoming game,

the pre-game rally, the Varsity
Letter Club dinner the evening
before, and the alumni luncheon

preceding the game is growing
every day, Homecoming officials
say. Tickets for each of the events
are going very rapidly according to
J. Clyde Barton, alumni secretary.

Backers of the drive feared that.
unless permission from the Univer-

would fall short of the $2500 goal.

With 385 in checks from alumni

as well as providing entertainment

University leaders, fearing that
the drive would give the impres-

Dean’s Letter Needed
For Induction Delay

Last Tuesday the News published a summary of regulations
regarding the draft deferment of college students. _Between the
time of their receipt by the News and their publication, however,
those regulations were changed. Here, then, are the details of the

ones now in effect.

Every college student now en-
rolled in a full time course and
doing satisfactory work, as certi-
fied by the dean of his school, is
automatically eligible for a post-
ponement of his induction until the
end of the current academic year.

Dean Supplies Letter
Certification of the student’s

status will be supplied by his
clean in a form letter which will
contain all the information re-

_ quired by the draft board.

The letter should be obtained
"as soon as induction ‘becomes
imminent,” or at the time the stu-
dent receives his notice regarding
the physical examination.

No Deferments Yet
It should be noted that "post-
ponement of induction” is not the
same as a deferment. The student

,who has his induction postponed

still retains his IA classification
and merely has his induction put
off until a later date. Deferment
means the inductee is reclassified
and no longer considered for induc-
tion.

It is anticipated that regulations
regarding the deferment of college
students will be announced before
the end of the present year.

More students are coming under
the arm of Uncle Sam’s draft law.

According to a recent Interna-
tionalNewsService release,married
non-veterans will be eligible for the
draft under an executive order soon
to be issued by President Truman.

This change in policy resulted
from Selective Service Director
Lewis Hershey's plea that married
men may have to be drafted if we
are to maintain an adequate army.

The present draft act authorizes
the President to regulate exempt-
ions. Mr. Truman some years ago
issued an executive order deferring
married men. Recent events have
caused Mr. Hershey to ask the
President to rescind his original
order.

P.-or Will Head
Panel on Labor

Jacob J. Blair, professor of in-
dustry here, will head a panel of
experts who will discuss the quest-
ion, "Wages, Prices and Strikes --
Can We Get the Facts?” at a town-
meeting in Carnegie Lecture Hall
on Oct. 26 at 8:15 p.m.

The town-meeting, open to all,
is sponsored by the Hungry Club.

The question discussed will be
whether fact-finding boards having
access to the records and books
of companies, as well as general
economic facts regarding price and
wage levels, can help the public to

 

form opinions on threatened strikes.

The need for wage increases in
some industries, before the impos-
ing of wage controls, will be in-
cluded in the discussion.

Irish Room

Bids Taken

Room 127 on the first floor of
the Cathedral is slated to become
the seventeenth nationality room.

According to A.A. Klimpcheck,
University architect, work on the
proposed Irish Nationality Room
will be started near the end of the
year.

At the present time the planning
department of the University is
taking bids to estimate the approx-
imate cost of the work.

New Motif

Compared to the other rooms,
the design for the Irish room is
entirely different in that it will be
made completely of stone, repre-
senting the turrets and battlements
of ancient Irish castles.

It is estimated that approximately
990,000pieces of separate carved
stones will be used. Among these

are sandstone walls, hard flagstone
floors, and imported stained-glass
windows.

Plans were given to the Univer-
sity by the Irish government under
the sponsorship of Ireland’s presi-
dent, Eamon De Valera, and re-
ceived by the Irish room committee.

College Emblems Planned

The coat of arms of three Irish
universities, Trinity College, Na-
tional College of Ireland, and
Queens University in Belfast, will
be placed in the room.In addition,
the arms of the families of Lein-
ster,Ulster, Connaught and Munster
will be incorporated into a shield
and placed directly over the door.

Job Outlook Bright in Pittsburgh

The employment outlook for the
Pittsburgh area in the next few
months looks definitely brighter.

That’s the conclusion of a re-
port recently issued by the Penn-
sylvania State Employment Ser-
vice.

Total employment in the Pitts-
burgh area is estimated currently
at 900,000 with women represent-
ing 227,200 of this total. This
total employment figure is ex-
pected to rise to 910,800 by Nov.
15, 1950.

Unemployment declined to 58,000
during the months of September and
October, and over the past year
employment totals are estimated to
have increased about 4.4%.

Workers Needed
Employment increases are anti-
cipated in food products, apparel,
lumber products and furniture, and

Civil Service

Jobs Open

The U.S. Civil Service Com-
mission has announced its 1950
examinations for junior manage-
ment assistants to fill positions in
various Federal agencies in Wash-
ington, D.C.

The purpose of the examinations
for these positions which pay en-
trance salaries of $3,100 per year,
is "to bring promising young men
and women into government ser-
vice and to train them for future
executive positions,” according
to the commission.

Applicants must have completed
an appropriate 4-year college course
or have had 3 years experience as
a staff manager or professional
assistant.

Applicants must also be between
18 and 35 years old and be able

limits will be waived for veterans.

Further information may be ob-
tained from the placement service
on the 8th floor of the Cathedral.

College Dean Replies

To Criticism in °Life’

‘By JACK MARKOWITZ

1

Dr.

Stanton C. Crawford, dean of The College, says that a

recent Life Magazine article criticizing practices in the nation’s
liberal arts colleges is "an excellent one,” but that it does not
apply to the University of Pittsburgh.

The article, "Know How vs. ‘Know Why,’

)

written by Dr. Ber-

nard Iddings Bell for Life’s special Oct. .16 education issue, is

a critical attack on what the author
believes to be a tendency in all
phases of American education to
respect quantity instead of quality.

In an appraisal of the college
aspect, Dr. Bell contends that col-
leges are being converted into
"education factories.”

Herding of Unfit Students

Dr. Bell concludes that "the effect
of this is?o‘i herd an increasing num-
ber of unfit persons into colleges of
liberal arts, whose proper business
is to help students of exceptional
intelligence to understand human
affairs and to develop sound judg-
ment therein.” .

‘This, Dean Crawford says, is not
necessarily an indictment of the
liberal arts idea or of most liberal
arts colleges. A

It is true, the College dean adds,
that certain colleges do have low
entrance requirements which encour-
age and -attract inferior high school
students.

This is not true of The College of
‘the University of Pittsburgh, Dr.
Crawford says, since few students
are accepted from lower than the
upper two-fifths of their high school
‘classes.

Leadership aGoal

To Dr. Bell’s contention that the
liberal arts college’s purpose is to
prepare students of exceptional
intelligence for eventual positions
of leadership, Dr. Crawford answers
that Pitt’s conception of "leader-

Town Meeting
Hears Debate

The opening of the Pitt Town
Meeting series Friday will be high-
lighted by a debate between the
Men's Debate Association and a
team from Western Reserve Uni-
versity.

and the representatives of the
Cleveland school will support the
negative.

For several days following the
town meeting debate, the two teams
will visit several high schools in
the Pittsburgh and Cleveland vici-
nities and debate the high school
topic. ‘Exhibition debates before
high school audiences are an an-
nual activity of the Western Re-
serve and Pitt teams.

The first intercollegiate tourna-
ment will be held tonight at 7:30
in the Cathedral of Learning with
six teams participating.

War Jumps Cadet Quota

The current international situa-
tion has affected Pitt’s ROTC pro-
gram.

According to C01. Holland L.
Robb, head of the department of
military science and tactics, cadet
quotas here have been increased-
in both the army and air force
branches.

Enrollment in ROTC has also
increased but its quotas have not
been filled.

Another expansion move was
that of allowing senior veterans to
take a one-year advanced course

and air force reserve corps at a
considerable saving to the govern-
ment.

Pitt’s 1950 ROTC graduates
outnumbered the largest West Point
class prior to World War I, the col-
onel said.

Although most of the 1950 grad-
uates received only reserve com-
missions,a good manyof them have
already gone on active duty or are
expected by Col.Robbto be called
in the near future.

For several weeks before the drive to send the band to Notre
Dame began, there was a lot of discussion about how wonderful
it would be if the band could make the trip. Now that it seems
possible that the band will go, we can translate our enthusiasm
into hard cash.

Twenty-five "hundred dollars will send the band to Notre Dame.
We have figured that there are about five thousand fulltime stu-
dents who would be willing to contribute 50 cents a piece. So
far we have only received a ten dollar contribution from one stu-
dent. _This does not reflect overwhelming enthusiasm. ‘

From Alumni and outside contributers we have fared a little
better. They have come across with about 100 dollars. This is a

fair indication of the pop.ul arity of the band among outsiders con-
sidering that relatively few people other than students know about
the drive. _

Itis still too early in the campaign, however, to be pessimi$ic.
We feel confident that campus organizations, students, alumni and
friends of the University will let their support of the band be
known. We plan to let everyone know of their support by running
in each ed-ition a list of those who contribute a dollar or more.

Get on the bandwagon and Send the Band to Notre Dame.

Mrs. Florence Bowman

We wish to extend the sympathy of the entire University to
President Bowman. The tragic death of Mrs. Bowman is a great
loss to the community.

Notre Dame NiOl'eS By LEONARD BAKER ~

This is the first in a series of background articles for the Notre Dame
game. Articles will appear in each succeeding Tuesday issue.

On November 11 over 300 students will get off the Pitt Special
in South Bend with but one cry-— "Kill the Irish!” The possibility
of seeing Pitt slaughter the Irish this year might not be too

strong, but it's not impossible.

Of 16 previous encounters Pitt has lost ten, tied one, and won

five.

The Pitt-Notre Dame series started
way back in 1909. Pitt lost. In the
next two games Pitt took another
defeat and made the only tie of the
series. In the last of these three
N-D had on its side a young player
named Knute Rockne. Pitt didn’t see
N-D or Rockne again until 1930.

The game attracted the first capa-
city crowd, about 65,000 people, to
Pitt Stadium. Rockne, who was to die
the next year in an airplane crash,
watched his team score 35 .points
in the first half. Mercifully he sent
his second and third teams in for
the rest of the game. They only
scored 19 points against Pitt.

Things were black for the Blue
and Gold. But the Panther was on
the go. The tide was due for a change.

The next game, played in South
Bend, went to the Irish whose deep
passes brought the score to 25°12.

Thencame 1932. Notre Dame had
been undefeated. Pitt, also unde-
feated, had been tied by Ohio State.
The Stadium was filled by specta-
tors who breathlessly watched the
two teams hold their lines for the

first three quarters. Then in the
last quarter Pitt scored two touch-
downs to beat the Irish, 12-0.

That was the start of Pitt's win-
ning streak which lasted for five
games. These victories brought some
thrilling moments to the spectators.
In 1935 Pitt squeezed a 9-6 victory
by a field goal in the last quarter.

Notre Dame suffered one of its
most decisive losses in 1936 when
Pitt with 26 points kept the Irish
scoreless. In the 1937 game, the
last of the series, Pitt hadn't scored
by the end of the third quarter and
stood behind N-D by six points.
Then in the last quarter the Panther

The series started again in 194
and lasted through 1948. The games
were in all cases tremendous vic-
tories for the South Benders.

The game on the 11th starts a
new series. The experts are putting
the odds on the Irish but whatever
the outcome, the Panthers will have
all the spirit any team needs when
the Pitt Special pulls in.

way, did you know that Dr. Edwin '

Peterson taught a course in fly-
tying this summer? His 10-year-old
daughter, Peggy, acted as his lab
assistant.

Laifolity Points Go Begging

That may or may not be true, but
I can quote page and column from
an article in the Miami Hurricane,
the school paper, which says that
free quality points were going
begging last Spring down in Coral
Gables, Fla.

Under the Miami plan, a student
could get quality points by reading
books in a field outside his major.
Even the Miami students didn’t
believe it. In theory it's and excell-
ent plan to encourage that "well-
rounded education.” But a brief re-
port to a faculty member was the
only assurance the schooldemanded
from the student to prove he had
read the book.

Can't you see us now, all straight
‘A’ students if we transfer? On
graduation day we could modestly
say we owe our success to glanc-

ing at every tenth page of some
dull tom‘: while hiking down to
the beach for our deep-sea fishing
class?

Fashion Leaders

Seriously, though, Miami is a
great school, and they have some
people down there with real cour-
age. Like the guy pictured inthe
Hurricane who showed up at the
big school dances in one of those
short-pants tuxedos -- bony knees,
hairy legs, horn-rimmed glasses,
starched shirt and all.

The Hurricane is one of the
country’s best college Weeklies,
but I thought they had made a boner
when I glimpsed the name Long-
more on the sports page.Now Long-
more (pronounced Lawn-mower
when he was a high school stu-
dent, but seldom when Ralph was
around) is the surname of a Duq-
uesne U. football player who is
built like Ferdinand the Bull, only
not so gentle.

My suspicion that the ‘Canes had
Pitt and Duke halfbacks mixed up
turned out to be just a cock-'n-bull
story. It seems a Miss Pat Long-
more had won the campus badminton
contest.

Record Set
By Mahanna

Sparked by Ken Mahanna, the
Pitt cross ‘country team defeated
the Case harriers on Saturday at
Cleveland, 22-33.

Expecting a fairly easy triumph
the Pitt thincilads had to go all
out to notch their third win of the

-season. Pitt’s Mahanna set a new-

course record of 22:54.1 for the
4.2 mile run. This was the third
time this year that the 19-year old
junior from Washington, Pa., had
finished first in collegiate competi-
tion.

The results of Frosh Week, how-

EVANSTON, Ill. - Northwestern’s Wildcats were glad their game

with Pitt ended when it did, for .they felt that if the game had gone an-
other five minutes, they’d have been licked.

Their opinion of the Panthers
echoed the sentiments of the Rice
Owls, who the previous week were
extended by Pitt in the final period.
It seems Pitt has become a strong
second half team and lacks punch
in the first half.

One Panther player said,
“Some day we're going to put a
whole ball game together, and
then watch out." i

Unknown Osterhout
Sharp in Regular Role

in WILL pounce ~

EVANSTON, Ill. -- Pitt seems to have the knack of coming

up with a new quarterback for every new opponent -- even if
Coach Len Casanova has to go the Jayvee ranks to get one.

First it was Bob Bestwick.

Then it was Fred Botti against Rice, and last Saturday it
was “Bullet Bob” Osterhout, a relatively unknown third stringer,
who took over against Northwestern and nearly passed the Pan-

thers to victory.

The left-handed Osterhout
wizardy in the final quarter that
enabled Pitt to score 23 points
and scare the unbeaten Wildcats
to death before losing, 28-23.

"I like the way they came back‘
when it looked like they didn’t
have a chance,” the Panther
coach said after the game. “Oster-
hout may have been erractic at
times, but he played a great game.”

Up From Jaarvees

Until the Northwestern game,
Osterhout was just another quarter-
back on the Pitt roster. He played
for the Pit: Jayvees in their 15-7
victory over the Ohio State
Jayvees.

But he got his chance Saturday

put on an exhibition of pas sing

when starter Botti proved ineffic-
tive, a Pitt appeared hopelessly
behind, 28-0. The sophomore trans-
fer -student from Navy then pro-
ceeded to complete 16 out of 35
passes for 161 yards in the late
rush, leading his team to three
TD’s and a safety.

Ends Chris Warriner and Nick
DeRosa tallied on passes from
Osterhout, and Osty personally
accounted for the third touchdown
by bucking over from the one.

Pass Defense Weak

Their old nemesis, pass defense,
caught up with the Panthers again,
as Wildcat quarterback Dick Flo-
wers passed for three North-
western scores and Bob Burson
passed for one. Ends Don Stone-
sifer and Burt Keddie eachiscored
twice.

Casanova felt that it was A com
bination of injuries and penalties
that caused Pitt's defeat. The in-
jury-riddled Panthers were penaliz-
ed 124 yards, 96 of these yards
coming in the second half, nullify-
ing many Pitt gains.

MIAMI U. has only 13 players
hailing from Florida, while there
are 18 Pennsylvaniens on Andy
Gustafson's squad.

I Panthers Improve Socially

At Chicago

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

EVANSTON, ILL. -- Tom Hamilton’s athletic department did

a nice thing here Saturday

Ordinarily, when the football team is on the road, the players

get little or no opportunity to sight-
see. They arrive on Fridays, take a
quick workout, eat supper, see a
neighborhood movie, and go to bed.
Next morning they rise, breakfast,
get taped, go to the stadium, play
the game, and shoot home.

Such was the routine followed
here last year.

Obviously, this kind of sched-
ule was disappointing to the cur-
ious young men, who wanted des-
perately to spend a night in nearby
Chicago where they could take in
the Chicago Museum of Natural
History, the Civic Opera, and other
cultural centers which strongly
tempt youthful football players.

The Pitt Band had been permitted
such privileges, causing right
tackles to feel they would get a
better deal by trying out for second

i tuba. Aware of the situation, Coach
Len Casanova suggested a remedy
this year.

Following the game, the gridders
were shifted to a downtown Chi-
cago hotel and given Saturday night
on the town. At departure time Sun-
day morning, Casanova was forced

to send no searching parties to
Skid Row.

Pin Band Witty

Speaking of the band, the boys
who handle the allegrettos and
andantes were at their level best
on Saturday. Disturbed by the con-
stant penalties against the football
team, they chimed in with a rendi-
tion of "Dear, Dear, What Can the
Matter Be?”

Eventually, they decided the
trouble was the fault of the offic-
ials and said so with a quick ver-
sion of "Three Blind Mice.”

Immediately after the game the

‘(P F\ qt‘ .
Band was surrounded by a large
crowd which was rewarded with a
thirty-minute jazz concert. All the
more reason to get this gang to
Notre Dame.

B’oIdin'sWomen

Either Guard Mike Boldin (pro-
nounced Boldeen) has women in
every port or the Pittsburgh girls
will travel any distance to watch
Gentleman Michael perform. He
has been the conspicuous object
of female attentions at Durham,
N.C., Columbus, Ohio, and Evan-
ston, Illinois.

Incidentally, the guy has been
the most outstanding Pitt line-
man this year. He plays full-time
on defense and frequently punches
the clock on offense, too.

The Northwestern game", fourth
tilt of the year, provided certain
proof of the top-flight defensive

abilities of Boldin, End Teddy
Geremsky, and Fullback Joe.
Schmidt.

Geremsky, a weak link in the

Pitt line last year, has developed
into a formidable terminal, easily
the best Pitt has. Sophomore
Schmidt was hurt early in the game,
but backed up the line brilliantly
during his short term of duty. It
takes three-man interference, and
then some, to take Big Joe out of a

play.

F rash Whip Kiski, Eye Army Clash

B)’ DON MURDOCK

SALTSBURG, Pa. -- Look out,
Army. After swamping an undefeat-
ed Kiski eleven on Saturday, 32-7,
the Pitt freshman football team is
hungry for some I I
real competition.

Fearing no one
the big and po-
werful Panther :
Cubs try for their.
third straight win
Friday, hoping to
revenge last ff
year’s Pitt loss
to the Army
plebes, 35-7.

The Kiski
game was strictly

Clmarolli

a no-contest. It took the Panthers
just seven plays after the opening
kickoff to punch across a score.

Lou Cimarolli, who scored 22
touchdowns at Bridgeville Iligh
last year, scampered 12 yards for
the Panthers first TD and also his
first collegiate six pointer.

On the first play of the second
quarter the Panthers once more

  

,reached paydirt. Late in the first
period Manuel Campa passed to
Joe Zombek for 16 yards and a
first down on the Kiski 7. It took
Art DiGiovanni two tries at the
line to score the second Panther
touchdown. He then calmly tacked
on the extra point by placement to
give the Panthers a 13-point lead.

With time running out in the first
half Bobby Epps threw a 6-yard
pass to Joe Leone, who raced five
yards for a touchdown. DiGiovanni
once again converted to give the
Panthers a 20-0 halftime lead.

Coach Johnny Chickerneo used
his first team sparingly in the se-
cond half. A tackle, John Reger,
was the last regular to score for
the Panthers when he intercepted
a Kiski pass and dashed 22 yards
for the score.

Pitt’s final tally came late in
the third quarter when DiGiovanni
traveled 46 yards for his second
touchdown of the afternoon.

With just 2'5 seconds remaining
in the game Glenn Ballard passed

to Ty Cogswell for a Kiski score.
The play covered 35 yards. Dick
Herbruck booted the extra point.

Sidelightsz

Epps of Swissvale and Bill
Adams of Oakmont were Panther
co-captains.

With the regulars sitting ‘out
most _of the game, the second and
third teams h_a_d_a_ chance to shine.
i I I  DiGiovanni look-
ed impressive
both on offense
and defense. Al-
though failing on
three of five ex-

’ were greeted with a few squad

told them to leave.

They then went up to Tech
but returned here in an hour.

Mr. Hedges asked them to
keep their celebrating outside.
After a few cheers on the lawn
they decided to come in about
this _time someone tried to
drive a jeep up the Bige10W

it “Trying to stem the rush
at two doors was too much for
one man and they succeeded
in getting into the Commons

While in the Commons Room
they snake danced between the
arches and also into the dean

to Mr. Hedges after a few more
cheers they left of their own
accord.

Plenty of Boxes

The two men separate all the in-
coming mail according to depart-
ments and distribute them into the
150 mail boxes that line the rear of
the office.

Joe Ortciger, the University
messenger, works directly from the
Post Office. Every day he makes

the rounds of all the campus
offices, delivering and picking
up mail.

Joe also spends a great deal of
time riding streetcars, for he makes
as many as three trips to downtown
Pittsburgh in a day. In his spare
time, Joe helps around the post
office.

Although the post office is not
run by the government and cannot
register or insure mail, it can serve
most student needs.

Strange Requests

Wilkie likes to tell the story of a
sweet young thing who rushed in-
to the post office and asked if an

Lebanon the next day. Dave said,
"sure” and sold the co-ed an air
mail stamp. "It would've gotten
there in regular mail too,” Dave
adds, “But she didn't ask me
that.”

Jewish Leader Lectures

On Morals Tonight

A prominent Jewish leader, who once served as rabbi of Rodef
Shalom Temple in Pittsburgh, will deliver the seventeenthof a
series of Pitcairn-Crabbe lectures tonight.

Dr. Samuel H. Goldenson will speak on "Education and Morals.”

Dr. Goldenson has served as
vice-president of 'the World Union
for Progressive Judaism and as
president of the Central Confer-
ence of American Rabbis. He holds
the degrees of Master of Arts and
Doctor of Philosophy from Columbia
University and the degree of Doc-
tor of Hebrew Law from llebrew
Union College.

Before he came to Pittsburgh in
1918, Dr. Goldenson served with a
congregation in Albany, where he
was once nominated for mayor on
the Progressive ticket. In 1934,
Dr. Goldenson left Rodef Shalom
to become spiritual leader of Con-
gregation Emanu-El in New York,
where he remained until he retired
in 1948.

Since then, Dr. Goldenson has
been making speaking tours across
the country under the auspices of
the Union of American Hebrew Con-
gregations.

Tickets for the lecture are avail-
able in the education office 2717Cl.

Federalists

End Trip

Six representatives of the Student
Federalists organization of the Uri-
versity have returned from the recent
national convention of the United
World Federalists in Washington,
D. C.

The students who attended were:
seniors Mary L tle and John Rooney;
sophomores A an Reuben and Jack
Ladley; Warren Swartzbeck a gradu-
ate student; andjohn Spanos, junior.

The agenda calledtor the election
of next year's officers and executive
council. The convention mapped out
the olicy of the World Federalists
for t e coming year.

The main controversy at the con-
vention was "partial federation vs.
universal federation.” Partial fed-
eration calls for a world federation
with Russia left out.

Universal federation calls for the
inclusion of Russia. Universal feder-
ation won by a majority vote in the
assembly.

A banquet, _held the final day of
the convention, raised $100,000 for
the orgaxization, of which $86,000
was raised by and for the adults.
