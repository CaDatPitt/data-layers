T.D., Runs Away With Trophyf  

BY HERSCHEL NISSEN SON

NEW YORK (AP)—Before he
ever played a game . for the
University of Pittsburgh, Tony
Dorsett wanted to quit. ‘

I _ But, says,Coach Johnny Majors,

“he never backs away from a
challenge. ”

Dorsett didn’t back away from
this one, either, and it paid off
yesterday when he won the

PAT Strike

  Students In

PITTSBURGH (AP)—Bus driv-
ers deﬁed the wishes of their
leaders and their union's interna-
tional board and voted to strike
when their contract expired at
midnight today. 1

A strike leaves 360,000 riders in
Allegheny County without the
transportation they use daily.

The members of Division 85 of
the Amalgamated Transit Union
voted 707-612 against sending the
stalled talks into binding arbitra-
\tion.

‘‘If that’s the wish of the
membership, so be it,” said Wade
Welsh, president of the 15-member
executive board which had voted
9-5 against a walkout.

ing college/football player in the
United States.”

It was a runaway for Dorsett,
almost as easy as his romps through
Pitt's 11 victims this year for an
all-time NCAA record of 1,948
yards.

The 5-foot—11, 192-pound senior,
son of an Alliquippa, Pa., steel
mill worker, carried each of the
country’s ﬁve voting 7 regions-
East, South, Midwest, Southwest
and Far West—-"and received 701 of

863 first-place votes, 112 seconds,

A Flurry  

It was also learned that two
officials of the union’s International
had warned that it would not
support a strike.

Almost 18,719 Pitt students will
be forced to rely on carpools,
thumbs, and feet to get to classes
due to the PAT drivers strike.

Pitt's Student Government has
formed an Emergency Carpool
Committee to ‘help students ar-
range rides to school. -Commuters
can file information about their
schedules. regular bus routes and

t stops, and their ability to provide a
car at the carpool station in the
Student Union lobby.

According to Chairman JoAnn
Levison, the carpool station will be
open throughout the drivers strike.

and 30 thirds for a total of 2,357
points. Twenty voters left his name
off their ballots. The voting is
tabulated on a 3-2-1 basis.

Ricky Bell, Southern California’s
star running back, ﬁnished second

‘ in each region but polled only 1,346

points on 73 ﬁrst, 485 seconds and
157 thirds. In third place was
another running back, Michigan's
Rob Lytle, with a total of
35-85-138-413;

“I guess this makes up for last
year,” said Dorsett, who thought he

shouldhave won the 1975 Heisman, ‘

but finished fourth. “Not too many
people get an opportunity to win the
Heisman Trophy.’ It only comes
once in a lifetime, except for Archie
Grifﬁn.” ' /

But the Heisman Trophy, th
single-season record of 1 ,948 yards,
the NCAA career mark of 6,082, the
all-time scoring‘ total of 356
points—-all could easily have been
nothing more than a string of zeroes
if Dorsett had had his way. ‘

‘ ‘I was sick and tired of football,’ ’
Dorsett said. “The first time I
wanted to quit was at a high school
all-star camp for the Big 33 game in
Pennsylvania. There were a lot of
other things I could be doing instead
of getting my body all banged up,
but if I had I’d probably be just
another person out on the concrete.
the second time was after training
camp my freshman year at Pitt. The
transfer from highschool to college
really did it to me.

“I’m basically a quiet person. It
was hard for me to even go out and
make friends with my own
teammates. I was ready to quit
school. My mom told me if I quit it
would have broken her heart. but
the person I’d probably be hurting
the most would be myself.

Johnson Wants NoCrusade  

BY RON NYSWANER

Sharon Johnson, a bio-chemistry
professor who for ﬁve years has
been ﬁghting a sex discrimination

'.battle against the University of

Pittsburgh, says she does not want
to lead a crusade.

“I regret any minute I have to
spend on this," shesaid in a recent
interview. “I'm more interested in
pursuing science."

Johnson was denied tenure by
the University in 1971 after
working as an Assistant Professor
without tenure since 1967.

Before ﬁling a civil suit, Johnson
‘went through all the internal
processes possible." including the
Afﬁrmative Action Committee, the

A

Senate Academic Freedom and-

Tenure Committee of the Univer-
sity. and meetings with the ‘Dean of
the School of Medicine.

Johnson -said the Academic

. _ Freedom and Tenure Committee of

the University Senate told her the
University followed. due process in

denying her tenure but “they also
found evidence of sex discrimina-
tion and evidence of harrassment.”

The evidence of sex discrimina-
tion was based, according to
Johnson, upon the simultaneous
cancelation of another woman's
contract at the same time as her
tenure denial. “There were three
males promoted at the same time,"
she said.

After the committee meetings,
Johnson said she used “all her
energies, for six months, trying to
get hearings with the Chancellor.

By the time the hearing was
offered to her. “it was too late...I
had a grant (of $93,000. from the
National Institute of Health) that I
had to ﬁnd a home’ for...so I turned
(the hearing) down on procedural
grounds.”

In April of 1972, Johnson ﬁled a
complaint before the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC) in Washington. A“The
EEOC suggested the University
settle—‘they found cause—-—for back

The
the

payment and tenure."
University did not accept
settlement.

Johnson ﬁled suit in 1973 under
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. which
guarantees equal employment op-
portunities, and its 1972 amend-
ments which uphold the application
of this law to educational institu-
tions.

In May of that year, District
Judge William Knox handed down
an injunction that maintained
Johnson's job until the suit is
ﬁnally resolved, basing his decision
partly on the “likelihood of
(Johnson's) success on a trial on
the merits” of the case. ,

This injunction has been called a
“landmark decision" by individ-
uals and organizations involved in
Johnson's suit. “‘First of all,"
Johnson said, explaining its impor-
tance, “It's a test of the 1972 Civil
Rights law which extended civil
rights to Universities...There are a
lot of Universities that don't want

Rep. Cohen Encourages.

Republican

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Uniﬁcation of the Republican
'party is essential for its survival,
accordingito Rep. William Cohen
who spoke Monday morning at the
Faculty Club.

“If the Republican party is going
to survive," Cohen emphasized,
“we have to be consistent.”

Cohen, who garnered 78% of the
vote in his home state of Maine in
the recent election, discussed at
length the GOP need for uniﬁca-
tion. ~

“We can't be ﬁghting amongst
ourselves,’ he said of the conserva-
tive and liberal wings of the party.
According to Cohen, Republicans
tend to ostracize members who take

extremist viewpoints-—to the lib-

eral conservative side.

Cohen also commented that
Republicans vote negatively on
much legislation which in turn
discourages new ideas. He
recounted that one of his own
propositions on conserving energy
was shot down immediately.

“The fact is. we‘ve opposed
every change since Teddy Roose-
velt was president." he quipped.

.“We just have a negative
reaction."
Cohen was a member of the

House Judiciary Commitee during
the impeachment hearings and
therefore escaped the taint of
Watergate. In discussing the
scandal's aftermath, however.
Cohen gave conflicting comments.
“Finally, the last vestiges of
Watergate are behind the Republi-
can party," he said of the recent
election. ~

Later, he said he made\his well
publicized opposition to John
Connolly as Gerald Ford’s running
mate last summer -becauseof the

Unification 

former’s connection with Water-
gate. Connolly's role in the milk
scandal was recorded on one of the
Watergate tapes and Cohen point-
ed this out because he said he felt
Watergate would be an insurmoun-
table issue in the campaign.

“It may be four years from now,
they’ll forget all about it,” Cohen
said. ‘‘I don’t think so. The press
has a long memory.” A '

SG Election  
Code Change

Proposed

» BY LISA R.UBENSTEIN

Candidates in this year’s Student
Government Board (SGB) elections
will be permitted to run on a slate
without registering under a party
label if- election code revisions are
passed by the.SGB tonight.

The Student Government Elec-
tion Committee (SGEC) met last
night to revise the code and to
prepare a timetable for the
elections. ‘

According to Committee Co-
chairman Ron Iong, the revision
which would permit candidates to
run on a slate without a party name‘
is to simplify things for the

candidates, and to free them from '

labels. According to the code,
parties, which are permitted, may
not consist. of more than one
presidential candidate and four
candidates for the board.
Co-chairman Kevin Tatman an-
nounced last night petitions for the

to have that law tested."

Johnson’s case is the ﬁrst time
such a test has been made. “I
think I’m the ﬁrst woman to be

‘reinstated under court order.”

When the case came to trial in
1975, Johnson again offered to
settle for back pay and tenure, and
again was refused. Johnson said
she hopes it finally will be
resolved next year. V

She said, however, the Univer-
sity is intentionally prolonging the
case. “It all could have been
settled so long ago.”

Johnson cited some examples of
what she terms “delay tactics”
used by the University. “My
deposition was taken six times-, it
took over a year...”

A year is an unusually long time
for a deposition, she said. Johnson
said hers was extended by

postponements and the repitition of .

several questions.

At deposition meetings, Johnson
said, she was ‘repeatedly asked
seemingly irrelevant questions,
such as, “Who do you talk to on the
phone?” and “Does your husband
wash the dishes?”

I “It’s their (the University's)
beneﬁt to keep it drawn out,”
Johnson claimed, “because I’ve
got my career to lose, Sylvia
(Roberts, her attorney) or I might

' get sick. Every year that goes by is

very detrimental——we may run out
of money. The University, I doubt
will ever run out of money.”

_ ‘ ‘All we can deal with is facts and
the University has fallen on this
track of attack, destroy and avoid
the facts in court,” Johnson
claimed. _

The most, recent of these
“questionable tactics” used to
delay adjudication of Johnson’s
case, according to Johnson, is the
University's charges of profession-
al misconduct against Sylvia
Roberts this year. :Roberts has
hired her own lawyers, including
Albert Jenner, former minority
council on the Senate Watergate
Committee, to ﬁght these charges.

Roberts has been Johnson’s
attorney almost since the case
began. “When I was ﬁrst having
problems with the University,”

9.»

_ Page 2—THE PITT NEWS——Wednesday, Detcemberfi, 1976'

Johnson said, “I knew it was going
to bethe end‘ of my career unless I
really did something in a hurry. So
I wrote to all kinds of places.” ’

One of the places she wrote to was
the National Organization for
Women's Legal Defense Fund,
whose address she found in a
“Where to Get Help Against Sex
Discrimination” column in
Woman’s Day magazine. Roberts
is a general council for this fund.

Johnson said she has been able
to ﬁght the University thus far
because “I have Sylvia Roberts as
my lawyer._ She's one of a kind,
there’ll never be another like
her...No one (else) will live under
the circumstances she lives under,
sleep as little as she sleeps, and
suffer as much as she suffers."

Johnson’s house has been turned
into a law ofﬁce, with bulging ﬁle
cases, stacks of computer output, a
Xerox machine, and a computer
terminal as furniture.

Workers often camp out in
Johnson’s living room. “When I
go to bed at night,” she said, “I
hear typewriters tapping away.”

When Roberts is in Pittsburgh,
working on the case, she sleeps on
one of the couchesin the living
room among all the clutter.
Johnson said she has seen Roberts
stay awake working all night, and
still make a good presentation in
court the next day.

Johnson’s suit is a family
enterprise. She has photos of her
children loading transcripts into
their truck to take them to court,
and of workers, some volunteer,
sitting at a picnic table in her home
typing and checking court docu-
ments.~

Her struggle may sound like an
inspiring cause around which to
rally, but it has caused Johnson
and her family great amounts of
money and time. Johnson also has
no desire to be any cause’s—leader.

“There was no choice," she said
about her decision to file suit, “it
was either lose your career or go

career, being denied tenure,
especially in the way_it was done
here at the University, is almost
tantamount with not getting a job
anymore...(It) is very, very detri-
mental." '

Johnson knows that she may be
seen by some as a crusader. “That
always comes about. even if you

don't want to be a crusader. even if _

you just want to do science.

“(This suit) is very exhausting.
I'd rather have my home life, my
family life, and have some
colleagues...like I used to have.”
Johnson said her suit has

I “definitely” hurt relationships
with peers and students.

Despite her hesitancey to be
afﬁliated with a cause, Johnson
seems aware of the importance of
her cause to the women’s move-
ment. “Women...in my ﬁeld are in
a very bad position." She said
there are many qualiﬁed women
available for jobs that often are not
hired, and women are told by
employers, “You have other
responsibilities."

Johnson takes her work, the

isms very seriously, as do many
others. Compared to the work of
the men promoted when she was
denied tenure, "I am cited many.
many more times (by other

researchers) and it's comparable to
professional quality work."

She also is concerned with the
amount of money the University is
spending for legal fees, and who is
allowed to decide how to spend the
money. According to testimony
she has heard in court, the
decisions “are turned over to the
lawyers. They call the shots.”

Johnson can laugh and even joke
when talking about her case. As
she said about theismiling faces in
many of the photographs she has.
“We don’t like to growl." "

In Churchill, she works with the
Red Cross and YMCA, “where,"
she said, “they know me just as
Mrs. Johnson," and are unaware
of the court case.

“When the case is over, Johnson
said she is willing "to forget, if

others do the same, so she can go‘

on with her work and homelife
without interruption. ‘‘I’m trying
to keep myself together as a person
during all this.” Her detached

BREZHNEW CLAIMS US-SOVIET
TRADE IN JEOPARDY

MOSCOW (AP)—Soviet lead-
er Leonid I. Brezhnev said
yesterday that the growth of trade
between the United States and the
Soviet Union was in jeopardy
unless the United States ended
“discriminatory" trade policies
that linked trade with political
conditions.

“If the current situation contin-
ues, nothing good for Soviet-
American trade will follow,"
Brezhnev said in a strongly worded
speech to a dinner meeting of the
U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic
Council here.

U.S. Treasury Secretary William
E. Simon, honorary co-chairman of

the three-year-old council of’

American businessmen and Soviet
trade groups, called for “strength-
ening of economic ties” after
saying earlier that helagreed trade.
restrictions against the Soviets
should be lifted.

Stranded Commuters

- Bus and trolley drivers for the Port Authority went on strike today,
leaving those dependent on PAT for transportation stranded in their own
neighborhoods. .

This is especially serious for commuting Pitt students who ride buses V
to get _to class. They now face the possibility of not being able to get to
their lecture of ﬁnal exams later this month, should the strike last that

‘ long.

Both the Port Authority and Pitt’s Student Government have
independent plans to solve the problem. Both involve people who drive
sharing rides. JoAnn Levinson and her assistants are to be commended
for the time they have sacriﬁced to help their fellow students.

Whether or not their plan works will be academic tomorrow. But
neither Levinson, nor anyone with Student Government are the key to
the plans’ success. Commuting students who drive are. It is up to thbse
who have the room to volunteer to provide rides.

They can save students from potential failure in the wake of the Port

Authority drivers strike. A"

  An A Ideal Climax

The Heisman Trophy winner has been announced and Tony Dorsett’ s
name rests in the football history books beside Paul Hornung, Roger
Staubach, OJ: Simpson and Archie Grifﬁn. This trophy is an ideal
climax to Dorsett’s record setting, four year career with the Pitt
Panthers.

This is a rare honor to be bestowed upon a university and one of its’
students. But Pitt should not waste valuable time basking in the glory of
its’ ﬁrst-ranked  back.

By now the University of Pittsburgh is a household word across the
nation. The University must take care and avoid certain pitfalls.

The athletic department’ must not overemphasize football. Pitt’s
other ﬁne teams should not be de-emphasized and forced tolive in the
shadow of the pigsldn. Pitt must strive to avoid a situation like Penn
State’s, where the football team and the athletic department are
synonymous. The athletic department must rule the football team, and
not vice versa. ~

Pitt must avoid becoming another Ohio State or Oklahoma; schools

that worship football above all.

With a nationally renowned name, Pitt will be attracting a broad base
of students from across the country. This will bethe greatest spinoﬁ Pitt
will gain ﬁ'om its’ top ranked football team.

The administration must move now to make sure Pitt is a school these V

students want to attend.
The University must balance a number one football program with a
number one academic program;

I

  Say It Ain't So, Johnny  

The only sour taste left in the mouths of Pitt football fans is the
prospect of head coach Johnny Majors leaving to ‘become head coach of
the University of Termessee football team.

The ideathat he may be leaving for more money and prestige gives the
students he ﬁlled with pride and enthusiasm a bitter feeling of betrayal.
Afeelingthatcannotbeabatedbytalkofgivinghisjob to former Notre
Dame head coach Ara Parseghian. ,

Majors never led students to believe that he would stay here and build
a dynasty. But many students would like it to be that way.

ter. Which is all the better for
trying to relate to him as the rest of
the world does.

I've always tried to keep a
psychological distance from media
sports. I thinkpthere’s a danger in
becoming mundanely obsessed
with box scores, pool sheets, and
sequined behinds. Z

Xet for all my cautious football
viewing, I’ve nevertheless been
caught trekking up Desoto Street
with the best of ‘them, waving
pennants and pompoms, buying
T-shirts, then buttons to puncture
my clothing with.

IMPRESSIONS

The past four years have not

been easy for me. A guy who tries .

with all his might to resist

something that makes him hoarsei_

with delight must be in a sort of

I quandary from time to time. I have

‘ been. I am not now. And I owe it
to Tony Dorsett. M
I used to sit skeptical in the
stands, game after game, season
after season, through snow and
rain, with hot chocolate and spiked
Coke, trying to curb my excite-
ment, suppressing the realization
that I was ecstatic with
whenever that blue and gold jersey

joy »

to Go, Tn Way to‘G

turned loose downﬁeld and ran for
the uprights.

But Dorsett’s climactic season
was enough to make me face
myself. Here was a fellow student
enrolled in the same program as
me, plummeting down the road to
football history. 4 The couple of

' generations that follow.me will no

doubt ask me what it was like to go

to school with the lionized T.D.’

Ignoring his talent and contriving
reasons to discredit it would just
not do for a handful of wide-eyed
grandchildren who might be bored
by the halftime show‘ at some latter
day New Year’s bowl. I must pay
him more attention, I thought.

Yet this season was not a case

where one had to force himself to
stop and take notice of the paths
Dorsett was burning across the
turf. A

His performance was so superb
that it commanded attention.
Those who didn’t notice were
either asleep for four years or dead.
The rest of us, the diverse,
light-headed,-screaming, stomping
thousands, pledged to tell the story
of Dorsett’s games over and over
tilllposterity would be satisﬁed. I
pity the short of breath; it will be a
long time before fans yet ‘to be born
will tire of old 33’s gridiron heroics.

It’s been a momentous six days
for Dorsett. From the wet
drubbing he and the Panthers

ﬁnally gave Penn State--the night 3;;

everyone was a Pitt fan——to
Monday's awarding of the Lambert
Trophy and yesterday's copping of
the Heisman, Pitt's greatest
running back deserves to be sailing
higher than the rare birds that
perch on the summit of the
Cathedral of Learning.

While the millions like me who
communicate with Dorsett only
through news and magazine
articles don’t have the slightest

inkling of what the man’s character it



speaks of, we "can only hope that H

what he has earned is satisfying to
him the way it is sobering to us.

And so it’s only left for us to go
up to him the next time we see him
on the street or in the Towers, and
shake his hand like the friends that
we are, for we’ve talked before.
Sure, we’ve spoken to him from the
top of Section 15, yelling every

Saturday. “G0. Tony! Run like
hell!"

_But now that the cheers have
died down and only that final
championship game is left, to
pause and reflect on _Dorsett's
achievements would do no one
harm. If all of us could do one
thing as well as Dorsett has done
his, the earth would be inhabited
by supermen.

J As it is, we can have no choice
but to be humble yet proud, and
Say Way to 30. Tony. way to go.

How the Activities Fee is Split

, BY BILL 0’DONNELL

The use of the Student Activities
fee and how it is distributed will be
a prime topic in the’ Student
Government Board’s.(SGB) opinion
survey.

A few computer selected stu-
dents will be questioned on the
functions of the SGB, as well as the
Allocations Committee.

The Students Activities fee is an
assessment approved by a referen-
dum of the student body, the Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs, the
Treasurer of the university, the
Chancellor. and the Board of
Trustees.

It is a mandatory fee listed on
each student’s invoice and is
assigned for allocation to any
recognized student organization.
Although these funds are request-
ed by and ‘at the disposal of the
students, the fee must be approved
by the Board of Trustees. The

\
«

reason. is since the fee is
mandatory, they are legally res-
ponsible for spending it in
accordance with University policy.

The Student Activities fee is

perniitted for use only to support

social, cultural, recreational, educ-
ational or community service
programs, which are initiated by
student groups and approved
through their allocations proced-
ures, for the primary benefit of Pitt
students. ,

All allocations procedures are
handled through the 8~member
Student Government Allocations
Committee. Every student orgar»-$.-
zation that needs funds must
submits a budget to Allocations for
research and approval. This
committee investigates every item
on a group’s budget and the
rationale for it. They interview
members of student organizations
before any student monies are
appropriated. When the committ-
ee is satisﬁed, the student group,
with its Allocations Committee
liason. presents the budget before
the Board for approval.

Any undergraduate student or-
ganization having full or partial
recognition from the 5GB is eligible
to apply for funds generated by the
Student Activities fee. Partially
recognized groups may apply for a
maximum of $l00.

iWhen the Allocation Committee
is reviewing a request for funds, it
takes into consideration a specific
criteria. Most important is the
degree to which the student
group's programs benefit the
University com.munit.y as a whole.
especially the i’uli—time un»;ierg'rad~
uate students. They also take into
consideration the amount of fund-
ing received and how responsibly it
was managed by the group in past
years. In addition, they determine
how the group has used its funds
according to its constitution and
by-laws; and for the diversity and
enrichment of the activities pro-
gram.

Bill O’DonnelI is a member of the
Student Government Public Rela-
tions Committee.

T.D. Runs Away With Trophyt

/Continued from Page 1)

“She didn't really have to do too
much talking to get me to go back

happened to me if I hadn’t gone
back. A-liquippa’s a small

Instead, Dorsett tackled football
at Pitt “like a man possessed in his .

casually in a blue denim leisure suit
and wearing a gold chain around his
neck that proclaimed both him and
Pitt No. 1. '

Dorsett didn’t get to eat much at
yesterday’s Heisman luncheon,
either, but he'll have time for a full
meal next Thursday night when he
formally receives the trophy at the
annual Heisman banquet.

“My mom and the rest of my

of December 9 when we can come

BY JIM FARERI

CBGB’s is New York City’s
underground rock hotspot, now
more in vogue than the legendary
Max's Kansas City which faded

along with glitter, the New York

Dolls, and Bowie's red hair. CBGB
stands for “Country Blue Grass
and Blues,” but chances are you
won't find ‘anything resembling
country music within several blocks
of this little but notorious lower
Manhattan bar.

The place is billed as “The Home
of Underground Rock," but these
days ‘underground’ means little
more than something unrecorded
and provincial. Any connotations
picked up in the sixties have
disappeared.

A double ‘album has been
released which attempts to present
a selection of the “important
bands” which have played CBGB’s

during 75-76. Unfortunately Live
At CBGB’s leaves out several of the
best of the bands that have
appeared there.

There is a sampling of eight
bands, each allotted up to three
tracks each.

Tuff Darts is probably the
tightest and most popular of the
eight. They play good straightfor-
ward rock, tinged with the ﬁfties
sound and reminiscent of Roxy
Music minus horns. They start off
the album with their best number,
“All For The Love Of Rock’n’-
Roll.” Tuff Darts is a band which
has developed a “style," that is
consistent and above average.

The second group, Mink DeVille,
injects variety with their vocalist
who sound like Jagger, Reed, and
Van Morrision--all in the same
song. Their ﬁrst two numbers are
heavily inﬂuenced by Lou Reed,
while the last and best, “Change It

DOLE SUGGESTS TAX CUT

WASHINGTON (AP)—.—For-
mer vice presidential nominee Bob
Dole warned Republican governors
yesterday that the party should
begin its comeback before it is too
late and suggested that a ﬁrst step
might be for Republican congress-
men to sponsor a tax cut bill in
January.

The Republican Governors-
Association then closed its winter
conference by votin g support of the
party platform, but only after
several governors said they
wouldn't want to be bound to it too
literally.

Talking to reporters after his
speech, Dole said congressional
Republicans are likely to introduce
their own tax bill early in the
session. 9

Comes," features a nice Latin-A-
merican beat and vocal.

The most impressive work on Liv
At CBGB’s comes from Manster.
The suddenly changing rhythms.
excellent slide guitar” work, and
Bowie-ish tremelo vocalizing give
“I'm Really Not That Way” an
alluring tone that othernumbers on
the LP lack. Their other number is
a playful, speeded-up version of
“Over, Under, Sideways, Down."

Another exceptional band is The
Laughing Dogs. They have a good
racy rocker in ‘‘I Need A Million,"
revealing more of the ﬁfties
influence than seems pervasive in
avant-garde rock. -Their “It Feels
Alright" is a well crafted and
professional piece capturing the
feel of the early and middle
Beatles. »

The Shirts are allotted the most
time on the album, but do the least
with it. They reek too strongly of

the sixties, using an archaic organ
of the psychedellic era and classic
boy-girl vocals. Within their long
arrangements though they do
manage to get in some moments of
nice guitar.

The remaining three groups Sun,
Stuart's Hammer and The Miamis
get a tune apiece. “Romance" by
Sun is from Led Zeppelin’s hardest
material complete with an award-
winning Robert Plant imitation.
Stuart's Hammer offers “Every-
body's Depraved, a strong, but
unoriginal piece burdened with
below average vocalizing. The
Miamis sing “We Deliver" in
ﬁve-part vocal harmony backed-up
by diluted instrumentation.
Nothing special here either.

CBGB’s has provided a place for
the best of the new rock bands to
build up a reputation and hopefully
win a recording label of their own.

Most rockconcert ﬁlms are
boring, over-hyped pieces of
muddled garbage. Usually shot
with a low budget and without
direction, they always fail to capture
the true spirit of the group they are

piece of cinema that ‘vividly

captures the unique personalities of " ‘ii

Led Zeppelin.

The ﬁlm starts out in England
with the band’s managers, Peter

down a houseful of monster-faced

The band boards a plane in
England, and is whisked away to the

Truffaut Captures
Children in ‘Change’, 

BY M. C. PILECKI

As unbelievable as it may seem.
Francois Truffaut can really be
funny.

Of late. he tends to be more
ponderous, and when he does try
for humor, his wit is rareﬁed and
not easy to appreciate. With Small
Change. though. it's a completely
different story. This is easily his
most human, humorous and
generally just plain fun ﬂick.

Which is odd, not simply
considering the source, but also the
subject: kids. Usually, adults who
try to do ﬁlms about childhood tend
to be maudlin, preachy. sentiment-
al or worse. Where there is
sympathy, there's generally an

. overabundance of mush, and where

there's “honesty" (usually in
capital letters), there’s an autobio-
graphical release of traumas (see
Fellini and Truffaut, himself for a
lot of that).

Small Change, is a welcome
departure from all whether you’re a
kid now and just experiencing all
the insanity that goes with coming
of age, or just recently departed
from it. And the fact that the movie
is about French school children (in
French with English subtitles) is
only incidental--childhood seems
pretty universal.

There doesn’t seem to be much
plot. Generally, the story centers

on a ﬂock of schoolboys at one
particular institution of learning
(seen to go modern with the
addition of schoolgirls), but Small
Change expands to include kids at
a local day care center, in some of
the town's apartment buildings.
and generally just anyone under
four feet tall. There are adults in
the story. to be sure-—parents here
and there, an assorted teacher or
two, and the general inhabitants of
this small town--but they are
somewhat incidental to the story,
as they often are in the lives of
children. , i
There are more subplots than
plot. but one of the principal stories
concerns a street kid--grimy, a
trifle larcenous, and usually on his
own--the kind not unknown in this
or any other society. As can be
readily seen early on in the story,
he doesn‘t exactly have an ideal
home life, and his methods of
coping border on the ingenious
before his secret is uncovered in
the story--not that it comes as any
surprise to the audience. V
He's an abused child, a fact that
comes out in a routine physical
examination at the school. This is
probably the only part of the movie
that is not readily applicable to the
U.S. society. The outcome of the
discovery is prompt arrest of the
abusing parent and‘ a general

Buildings Vie With

Merchandise at 'Bank"

BY MREA CSORBA

They’ll probably advertise ‘it as
‘Shopping in Splendor.’ Whatever
the plug, the newly opened
shopping complex downtown, The
Bank, means stiff competition for
it’s plasticized South Hills Village
or Monroeville Mall counterparts.

The complex is built into
splendor: ﬁve classical revival
buildings situated around‘ the
corner of Wood and Fourth
Avenue, constructed around the
turn of. the century offering a
variety of ediﬁce wonders not
found in ‘ordinary commercial

‘plazas. ’

But therein may lie a problem
not found in the other malls. Here,
the built-in and restored wonders
of the buildings rival the intrigue of
the merchandise it houses.

Shoppers heads will probably be
turned more by the landmarks’
carved stone, polished marble
Corinthian columns, solid bronze

friezes, gold-leaf gildings and
leaded stain glass ceilings, than
say, The Limited’s top-fashion
outﬁts or Plantasia’s wicker pots.
Families may take Saturday
outings here, to ride the mod,
circular glass elevator, rather than
to outﬁt the kids from Joseph
C0at’s stock. Or more so to explore
the depths of the huge safe deposit
vault whose chamber functions as
part of a hallway rather than to
discover the contents of the
sublevel Bank shops ﬂanking it.
Shoppers may wander with
heads gazing at the 727 panels of
ﬁnely wrought leaded stain glass
that forms the Old Colonial Trust
Company's skylight ceiling, and
miss the slickly laid-out window
fronts of the ground level stores.
Regardless, whether you go to
gape or shop, check out the ﬁne
crafts shop—-The Critics’ Walk.

having seen the problem earlier. In
fact, the recriminations and scan-
dal surrounding the case of child
abuse are more surprising than the
incident itself to American aud-
iences. much more jaded about the
problem.

Therest of the movie is more in a
clear vein of mischeivous fun, not
just the “honest, wholesome" kind
out of Norman Rockwell, but the
more normal, kid stuff. Like
sneaking into a movie theatre or
using binoculars to watch a young
woman dress. Plus shoplifting. the
early stages of prepubescent
passion, experimentation with
“colorful" language, and all the
other things Andy Hardy never did.

The film works to dispel a lot of
the myths about childhood, like its
perpetual happiness and the
eternal innocence of children.
Without overdoing it, Small
Change points up the traumas of
being a small person, in a large

z world. where everything is bewild-

ering and not tailored for you.

It also shows how kids manage to
overcome the disadvantage of
being a kid and. occasionally, turn
it into an asset. In a striking irony

to the genuinely abused child is a
little girl who. left home from a
desired outing because she would-
n't conforms to her parents‘ idea of
proper dress. played on the
sympathy of her neighbors for a
free. sumptous meal. In a battle of
wills between a nine-year-old and
two adults. the kid sometimes can
win.

There's a lot in Small Change for
most people to identify with--which
is the primary reason for its
infectious humor. It's that “oh
yeah" brand of recognition humor
behind the film that keeps it
jumping and well beyond the limits

of mere geography or language.

Panthers,

Pitt Whips Penn State, 24- 7,

Ends Greatest Season Ever

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

An undefeated (11-0) season,‘
number one in the nation in the
major polls, the Lambert Trophy as
number one in the East, a Heisman
Trophy winner, a trip to New
Orleans, a possible coach of the year
and a national championship
staring them in the face——what else
could the Pitt Panthers want?

Well, a victory over _Penn State
would have been the topping, so the
Panthers’ 24-7 clawing of the
Nittany Lions last Friday not only
magnified all of Pitt’s other

distinctions, but restroed a sense of

pride.to the team which had fallen
the previous ten years to their
cross-state rivals.

To say the least, the Pitt win over

‘Penn State at rainy Three Rivers
, Stadium was the.culmination so far

in the greatest season ever in the
history of Panther football. Only a
Sugar Bowl victory over Georgia on
New Year’s day could mean more.

The win was proof that the
Panthers are for real; proof that
Tony Dorsett could indeed domi-
nate the Penn State defense as he
has done so many others; proof that
Carson Long(a field goal and three
conversions) could come up with the
big boots and overcome the memory
of a defeat which followed him for

-over a year; and, especially, proof

that the Panthers are a team and not
just Dorsett, as many people have
suggested.

“Although Tony was the man
people came to see,” Majors said in
a hectic Pitt lockeroom, after
Dorsett had rushed for 224 yards to
finish the regular season with 1,948

yards and 6,082 for his career. “I

have to agree that it was the team
effort which did it.”

lhe picture says it all. Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett,
honored yesterday by the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City as

the top collegiate football player in the nation.

And that team etrort gelled in the
second half of the ballgame when
Pitt broke a 7-7 deadlock to roll over
the team which has reigned
supreme in /the East over the past
decade. ‘ ’

What began as a battle of punting
between‘Pitt’s Larry Swider (who
punted ﬁve times for a 45.1 yard
average, including a 51-yarder) and
State's ‘Scott F itzkee (41.3 average),
turned into continually good field
position for the Lions. and a Penn
State score with just over three
minutes left in the opening quarter.

Starting in excellent position at
the Pitt 45, it took the Lions only six
plays to march down the slippery,
rain-soaked artificial surface to
break the scoreless tie. Quarter-
back Chuck Fusina, a sophomore
who took over for injured John
Andress early in the season, spotted
fullback Bob Torrey in the injured
flat, in what appeared to ‘be a
delayed screen, and the Penn State
blockers took over to clear a 21-yard
path to the end zone for Torrey, who
scampered in for the opening
touchdown. The extra point by
Tony Capozzoli ended what was
surprisingly the only Lion scoring.
The big play in the drive was a

27-yard toss from Fusina to split end X>

Rich Mauti. »

the first quarter ended with no *
further action, but the second *

period was different story. The
Panthers came up with three
turnovers—-interceptions by J. C.

fumble recovery by walk-on Glenn

Meyer——-but a return interception of f

a Matt Cavanaugh pass by_Rick

“ p Dorsett Picture-Perfect

 

BY RON SIEGEL

Scanning through the program
(which was published by Penn
State) at last Friday’s Pitt-Penn
State classic, conspicuously absent
from the pictures of the Pitt squad
was Tony Dorsett (pronounced
Dor-SETT, if you please.)

Not wanting to be forgotten by
the folks from Happy Valley, the
Heisman Trophy winner smashed
the b,00tl«yard career rushing
harrier and estabiished a new
l‘\l“C.«\..’-\. single—sea.son mark of 1.948
yards.

Dorsett broke or tied four other
NCAA records as he rushed for 224
yards and scored two touchdowns to
pace the Panthers’ 24-7 victory. He
tied Archie Griffin's records for
most 100 yard games in a season
(11), and a career (33), as well as the
careeratouchdown mark (59) set by
Glenn Davis of Army. A conversion
run earlier this year proved the
difference as Dorsett set a new
scoring high. surpassing Davis’

,.,

record of 354 by just two points.

In the jubilant Pitt locker room,
Dorsett was more concerned with
the ﬁnal score than any of - his
individual achievments.

“Archie Griffin's record (career
rushing mark shattered by Dorsett
at Navy on October 23) was the one I
really wanted," said the “H_awl<’“
as he ﬁeldedii harage of qu.-estion.s
from reporters. “Beating Penn
State is something we wanted to do
for four years.“

Pitt fans have heen waitin.g for-

the Panthers to beat Joe Paterno
and company since Pit:  East win in
1965. Dorsett and the other Pitt
seniors only remembered the last
three games, in all of which the
Lions emerged victorious after
trailing at the half.

“Four years ago, when I wasin
high school, I wanted to go to Penn
State,",revealed Dorsett, “but I

wasn’t recruited by them like I.

wanted to be."
(That and the football program

— snub were surely eno_ugh to drive

Dorsett on, aside from the national
championship, undefeated season,
and national television audience
that also were factors.

The holder of 14 NCAA records
responded with the sixth best game

Tony Dorsett’s.224-yard performance against Penn State at Three

third and final TD and is greeted by
Wilson photos

“Penn State will knock your tails
off," Majors commented on the first
half of play. ,‘‘They were the
aggressor and our offensive line
was getting whipped for a while,
and they surprised us with a couple,
of different defenses we hadn’t
seen. That and poor field position
made the game a dogfight.”

Dorsett was held to only 58 yards
in 16 carries in the ﬁrst half, so ‘~
Majors played the trickster against *
the Lions, coming out in the second 3
half in an unbalanced line with '
Dorsett the deep back in the I _
formation as well as one of the split .

N’ backs in the veer.
ﬂ> ‘ ‘The firsttwo years, we used the

I formation and gave him'(Dorsett)

the ball a lot,” Majors explained.
* “The last two years,w'e’ve mixed
* the I and the two split backs to kind

of keep people off balance on
‘’ defense so they couldn’t key on him
I» all the time.” i

N‘ The third quarter of play started
‘out much like the second, probably
{because of the steady rain which ‘
‘began to fall just before gametime
and drenched the 50,360 fans on
‘hand for the nationally-televised
affair. 1

Taking the kickoff, the Panthers
drove to the Lions 32, but
.*Cavanaugh’As pass to Taylor was

picked off by Lion defensive end Joe
‘’ Diange at the 20. Several plays K '

e i later, Pitt’s Bob Jury intercepted a
* Fusina bomb to Mauti at the Pitt 13
and returned the theft -to the
Panther 40. Again the Panthers '.

mounted a drive, this time to the
State 15-yard line, but fullback
Bobby Hutton coughed up the
football and the Lions’ Joe Diminick
fell on the loose ball at the Penn
State 13. *

After a punt by Fitzkee on third
down-to midﬁeld, Dorsett ran over
right guard for seven yards and then
around right end for three more to
the 40 of Penn State. The next play
was one of the many record-
breaking runs Dorsett has recorded
in the ﬁnest year and career of any
running back in the history of

* college football.

The 40-yard bolt, in which he
merely pecked his way up the
middle," then accelerated in a way
that only he can, Dorsett broke the
scoring record of Glenn Davis of
Army (1943-46) by amassing his
356th career point and tied two
records of Ohio State’s Archie
Griffin (now with the cincinnati
Bengals)——most 100-yard games in
a season (11) and in a career (33, a
most appropriate number).

p The third quarter ended with Pitt

on top by 14-7, but the Panthers’

were rolling and needed only four’
plays in their next series to drive 45
yards for another score, a 12-yard
burst up the middle by Elliott
Walker, with a minute elapsed in
the ﬁnal period, through a big hole
produced by the Panther offensive

 

’\

The holder of 14 NCAA records, Panther tailback Tony Dorsett made

line. It was Walker's first
touchdownrun since a‘ 69-yarder
against Navy ﬁve games ago.

But the runs which gained even
more recognition were an 11-yard
spurt up the middle to put Dorsett at
the unprecedented 6,000-yard ‘mark

as the third quarter ended "and a

quick pitch around left end one play
later for 17 yards, which gave the
“Hopewell Express” 160 yards on
the evening to surpass the single

season rushing mark of 1,881 set by

Cornell's Ed Marinaro in 1971.

Another conversion by Long
made the score 21-7 and, after Jury
intercepted his second pass of the
game and his ninth of the season,
tops in the nation, several plays
later, Long, the all-time leading
scorer by kicking, sent a 47-yarder
through the uprights with less than
12 minutes left in the game, and was
so happy that he jumped up and
down in jubilation and did a
somersault at midﬁeld. .

The scoring was ﬁnished, but
Dorsett wasn't. The holder of .14
NCAA major college records
escaped the grasps of a tired Penn
State defense" for a 42-yard gain
which put him over the 200-yard
mark for the ninth, time in his
career.

(“I thought we were the better
team,” came an obvious statement
from‘ Majors. “But that’s not
thinking lightly of Penn State,

 
   

his last collegiate appearance in Pittsburgh one of his best, scoring two
_ touchdowns in_Pitt’s 24-7 victory over Penn State, the first Ill 11 years.

because they're much younger than
we are. They are a team with ﬁne
ability and ﬁne young people, but
we're more experienced and we
have a lot of ability.
“This was our biggest win here.

It climaxed four years of work on
what we started to do.”

GRID NOTES: Seven Panthers
were named recently to the UPI
All-East team. Dorsett, Long,

center John Pelusi and guard Tom-

Brzoza were selected for' the
offense, while Jury, middle guard
Al Romano and tackle Randy
Holloway were honored on the
defensive side.

Not only are Jury's nine thefts
tops in the nation, the 24 recorded
by the Pitt defenders is the highest
for a team....lury also tied a Pitt

record set by Billy Reynolds in.

Ciccio, who took over for injured Ed
Wilamowski (pulled groin versus
WVU), had only a week and a half to
learn the position and performed
very well, sacking Fusina for an

The undefeated season was Pitt's
first since 1918. ..Majors was in New

BY JOHN FEYDO

The Pitt Panther basketball team
officially opened its 1976-77 season
with a cliff-hanging 79-77 victory
over the surprisingly tough Bobcats
of West Virginia Wesleyan last
Saturday night at Fitzgerald Field
House.

In a game in which the Panthers
may have taken their opponent too
lightly, Pitt needed a spinning
jumper from senior captain Frank
Boyd, on a nice assist from Wayne
Williams, to go ahead 79-77 with 52
secondssremaining in the game.

The Bobcats, a patient, well-dis-
ciplined team, then held the ball
until 15 seconds were left on the
clock when 6-6 forward John Bates
missed a baseline jumper. Panther
Mike Rice hauled down the
rebound and Pitt held on until Boyd
was fouled by Bobcat guard Mark
Davis-with three seconds remain-
ing. -

At the foul line with a
one-and-one opportunity, Boyd
missed the first shot as Bates
gathered in the rebound and
heaved a long pass downcourt to
Bill Thomas, a 6-4 forward and
Bobcat star of the game with 27
points and 11 rebounds, but the
ﬁnal horn sounded before Thomas
could get off a shot and the
Panthers had a narrow two-point
victory.

Larry Harris led the Pitt attack
with 29 points, as he hit 13 of 23
from the ﬂoor and three of ﬁve
from the foul line, while collecting
ten rebounds.

Wayne Williams chipped in with
12 markers on six of nine shots,

while Sonny’ Lewis, making his‘ Pitt
debut, and Scott Nedrow both had
eight. Lewis also dished out ﬁve
assists, as did pointguard Pete
Strickland.

The loss was the ﬁrst of the
season for coach Gary Hess and his
team, who are members of the
West Virginia Intercollegiate Con-
ference and winners of the recent
Lewis County (W. Va.) Shrine
Tournament. a

After the game, Hess said “I was
proud of the way we played against
Pitt. We were patient, but they
beat us inside on muscle. We tried
to stop Harris with a box-and-one
but he just outmuscled our boys
inside." '

Over in the Pitt locker room
things were very quiet, as if they
had just lost a two-point game,
instead of vice-versa.

“We just didn’t play well,” said
Head Coach Tim Grgurich deject-
edly. “We didn't play hard. When
we ﬁnally opened up a little gap,
we let them come right back at us.
I was very disappointed, we just
weren't prepared and that's my
fault. We'll have to work very hard
on every aspect of our game.”

Wesleyan jumped off to an early
16-6 lead as Thomas sunk four
quick baskets before the Panthers
came back to within 18-14 on three
straight hoops and a foul shot by
Harris with 11:46 to go in the ﬁrst
half. Pitt ﬁnally went ahead, 26-25,
as Nedrow picked offa stray shot
and drove the length of the court
for a lay-in at the 7:27 mark. The
lead then see-sawed back and forth
until David Washington put the
Panthers ahead to stay on a 12-foot
baseline jumpshot with 1:12
remaining in the ﬁrst half.

Pitt maintained a five to\

eight-point lead throughout the
ﬁrst ten minutes of the second half
as Harris counted eleven and
Williams eight during this stretch
to give the Panthers a little
breathing room. »

With 8:27 to go in the game
Nedrow again scored on a layup as
Pitt led by eleven, 70-59, and
seemed ready to blow the game
open.

During the next seven minutes,
however, the Bobcats caught ﬁre,
led by guard Glenn Pietras, who hit
ﬁve of six ﬁeld goal attempts and
six of seven from the charity stripe
in the second half, as they knotted
the score at 77-77 with 1:16 to go on
a three-point play by John Bates.
Williams then spotted Boyd cutting
across the lane under the Pitt
basket, hit his man with a perfect
bounce pass, and Frankie hit the
short jumper for the winning
margin.

Pitt hit on 37 of 79 loor shots for
46.8%, while Wesleyan canned 30
of 62, good for 48.4% From the
foul- line the Panthers were only
ﬁve of ten, for 50%, while the
Bobcats hit 17 of 21 for 81%. The
rebounding was fairly even, Pitt
gathering in 42 and Wesleyan 40.

A week ago Monday (November
22) the Panthers defeated the
Athletes In Action Challengers, a
touring group of Christian athletes,
by a 90-72 count in an exibition
contest at the, Field House in which
Pitt displayed Jeckell-Hyde ten-
dencies. as they. performed bril-
liantly in the ﬁrst half to lead 49-30
at halftime, but fell ﬂat in the
second half and were outscored
42-41.

High points of the game included
a 25-point, seven-rebound perfor-
mance by Harris, who took a very
hard spill late in the game while
driving for a stuff shot, and
required oral surgery to replace a
tooth which was jarred loose from
the impact. Harris hit ten of 20
from the floor and was particularly
brilliant in the ﬁrst ten minutes as
he connected on his ﬁrst ﬁve shots.

Williams also had a great night
offensively against AIA, hitting on
seven of 12 shots and pulling down
ten stray shots. while Mike Rice
collectd 14 rebounds.

As the Pitt defense broke down
in the second half, AIA gunners
Harry Sheehy (33 points), Al
Anderson (16), and Fred Towes

(14), all were putting the ball in the I

hoop consistently. The Panthers
regained their composure in the
final seven minutes; however, as
Harris hit three straight jumpers
and Rice climaxed the comeback on
a stuff shot with 3:22 to play.
The Panthers next see action
tonight as they hit the road against

another quintet of Bobcats. those’

of Coach Dale Bandy of Ohio
University in Athens, Ohio. It's
Ohio U's opener, and you can be
sure they remember last season's
hard-fought 72-71 loss to the
Panthers here at the Field House
when Tom Richards sunk a
40-footer at the ﬁnal buzzer ‘

If the Panthers expect to win on ‘

the road they will have to show vast
improvement in their total game,
especially in defense, where they
have been beaten badly at times.

The Ohio U. game will be aired by
p.m.

PANTHER CELEBRATION
ENDS IN FIGHT

A Panther Party, held to
celebrate the Pitt victory over Penn
State ' last Friday night, ended
chaotically when a series of ﬁghts
followed the closed-circuit broad-
cast of the football game.

The party and dance were held at
the 2001 disco. \

A Greensburg youth received a
head wound when he was hit by a
chair and was rushed to Allegheny
General Hospital. An off-duty
undercover Pittsburgh policeman
also received minor injuries when
he attempted to break up one of the
ﬁghts.

Pittsburgh Police and 2001
employes ﬁnally broke up the ﬁghts
‘and several arrests were made.

' 2001 employes reported most

people attending the party were not
from Pitt or Penn State.

The party, which was scheduled
to continue until 5 a.m. Saturday,
concluded at 2 a.m. due to the

. ﬁghts.
