allocations requests for term

By Teresa Candori
News Editor

The Student Government
Board approved eight emergen-
cy requests for funds from student
groups, denied three requests and
deferred two at their meeting last
night. _ .

The board denied a request
from the Black Action Society for
funds to host a Black Awareness
Luncheon. The original request
was for $740 to purchase food for
the luncheon. .

Alex Jones of the BAS ex-
plained that the request for food
had been a mistake, and asked
the board to consider a request

for $250'to fund parking, invita-
tions and a centerpiece. ‘
Melanie Naro, who moved that
the board accept the Allocations
Committee's recommendation to
deny the funds, pointed out that

the request was for funds to pur-

chase food, which are -not provid-
ed by allocations, and urged the
board to deny the request.

SGB President Phil Moyer,
however, urged the board not to
deny the request, butto have the
revisions stipulated by Jones writ-
ten into the request, 0

The board voted unanimously
to deny BAS’s request.

The board also denied a
$1,660 from the Greek Week

committee to fund professional
printing of their yearbook. Ac-
cording to Bohichik, the request
was made because the commit-

tee has been disappointed with .

the quality of the yearbook in the

past.

’’We.. recommend that Greek
Week workalittle harder on their
\yearbook if it hasn't been up to
their standards,” Bohichik said.

A $500 request from the Pan-
ther Lacrosse, team to pay referees
for a match was also denied. '

The SGB deferred two of its
own requests, one to fund a
leadership conference,’ deferred

Recent thefts forcing

extra security on hill

By George Bellios
For The Pitt News

Residents of the fraternity
houses on the hill are concerned
about an increase in thefts, over
the three years since the houses
opened. ‘ ' "

According to Steve Finter,
house manager’ at Sigma Chi,
”The major causes of the thefts
are carelessness on thepart of the
residents, along with the isolated
locations of the fraternities on the
hill.” ' .

Lloyd Rogers, the campus

police officer who patrols the»

area said, ”So_rneone could walk
into any fraternity house, because
many doors and windows are left
unlocked.” ' A

Many fraternities have taken
steps to

care to keep doors and windows
locked and keeping/a more care-
ful watch of the houses later in
the evening.

According to Rogers, ”A pub-
lic relations officer for the cam-
pus police is available to discuss
and implement a‘ crime preven-
tion system to check all doors and

windows which provide easy ac-

cess to strangers.”

Sigma Chi fraternity is current-
ly looking into an intercom sys-
tem or campus phone outside the
house, -in order to facilitate entry
by brothers not living in the
house and to make deliveries and
entrance of guests easier.

Finter said, ”This is an excel-
lent [idea] that should have been
implemented when the houses
were originally constructed.
There is a tremendous need for a
system of this type, and it should
be installed as soon as possible.”

’Sneaky’ may fac 6

increase house-wide ,_
security, such as taking greater '

According to Rogers, ”Between

10 and 12,000 dollars of equip- _

ment has been stolen from the
houses over the past threeyears.”

Other fraternities are con.- 1 
cerned about the problem as

well. ‘

 

Brendan Walsh, who lives"atl 

the Pi Kappa Alpha house, said,
’/Precautionary measures are

taken in most instances, but there 1

are times when people don't real_-_’ 0
ize thelthreat and inadvertantly

W5

neglect their responsibilities to: 

keep ‘the houses safe."

Robert Vandell of Sigma chi

added, ”A'definite contributing A

_ factor to the increase in crime in
the fraternity houses is a relative- '

ly close proximity of the houses

to the impoverished hill district.” 5

Still, Rogers contended that
there is enough security on the
hill to protect students and

property, ’’I believe the security '

on "the hill fits the needs of the  
fraternity houses, because. the 

area is patrolled by a walking»

policeman as well as a patrol
car.”

Jim Moratis of Theta..Chi ,said:,, _  
-”Security on the hill may be ade_-- 5  

 

quate, but a better monitoring .. -A ll

system is needed.” . 

Several carshave also been sto-

fraternity parking lots.-

len around the houses and in the . -3‘

’’Students should be permitted J K

to park in the central lot between

fraternity houses where there is a '

steady flow of traffic to deter any _  

potential thieves,” Rogers said.
He said he believes the outer

parking lots should only be used «

for special events when there is." "I

Militiamen attack Palestinian camps in Beirut

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Israeli jets
and Shiite Moslem militiamen at-
tacked Palestinian guerillas at
refugee camps Thursday, and offi-
cials haggled over how to get
food into the shantytowns, which
have been cut off for three
months.

Police said threeiwere killed
and 12 wounded in the attacks
on Palestinian camps in Beirut
and south Lebanon.

A dozen Israeli fighter-bombers
were involved in the raid on two
buildings used by the mainstream
Fatah guerilla faction near the an-
cient southern port of Sidon,
police reported. Fatah is led by
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organi-
zation.

Casualties from the Israeli
bombing at dawn on the outskirts
of the Mieh Mieh camp were
given as one civilian killed and
three wounded, including two
guerillas.

There is no known coordina-
tion between the Israelis and the
Shiite militia Amal, which is at-
tacking the Palestinians on the

_ground, but they have the com-

mon aim of keeping the PLO
from regaining the Lebanese base
it lost in Israel's 1982 invasion.

Alcosan directors call
for new code of ethics

PITTSBURGH — Directors of
the Allegheny County Sanitary
Authority, their agency embroiled
in a criminal probe of alleged job-
selling, proposed a code of ethics
to help clean Alcosan’s tarnished
image.

The board ordered a one-year
freeze on hiring for all but essen-
tial jobs. The freeze was pro-
posed by city Councilman and
Alcosan board Chairman Eugene
DePasqua|e, whose son and son-
in-law work at the authority.

torney Robert Colville said his

' staff and the U.S. Attorney's

employment.

Reagan calls for more

health care security

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan proposed Thursday that
Congress ”give Americans that
last full measure of security” by
providing health care for the
elderly through Social Security.

The plan essentially would pro-
vide health care coverage under
Medicare, while limiting out—of—
pocket expenses to $2,000.

The coverage would cost Medi-
care beneficiaries an additional
$4.92 a month, or $59 a year.

Reagan, in a statement, said, ’’I
am asking Congress to give
Americans that last full measure

of security, to provide a health in-

surance 'plan that fights the fear
of catastrophic illness.”

Man and wife robbed
by masked intruders

BROOKVILLE, Pa. —- A
60-year-old man was beaten, his
wife bound and their home
robbed after he opened his door
to two men who forced their way
inside his Jefferson County home,
state police said Thursday.

State police Cpl. Robert Day
said the intruders, who were
wearing ski masks, punched John
Henry Weary when he opened
his door around 6:30 p.m. Wed-
nesday. The men tied up his wife,
Blanche, 55, then went upstairs
to the couple's bedroom where
they opened a safe.

The men took the empty safe
downstairs, then assaulted Weary
again, according to Day. During
the struggle, one of the intruders
may have been shot with Weary’s
.22-caliber pistol.

Although students living in
Oakland say they don't feel as
threatened by crime as they did
earlier in the year, they are still
cautious when they go out.

Joseph Jamieson, 43, also
known as ”Sneaky,” the Shady-
side rapist, was convicted Wed-
nesday of all 26 charges brought
against him. This included: seven
counts of rape and two counts of
assault.

The publicity surrounding
Jamieson’s conviction, along with
the sentencing of a 15-year-old
charged, with two counts of rape
and 14 counts of burglary in
south Oakland, has made stu-
dents more aware of crime in the
area.

Since the convictions of these
two men, many Pitt students said

they feel a lot safer. However,
they agreed the potential of crime
is still prevalent and students still
need to be cautious.

Dawn Griffin,‘ a Pitt senior,
lives alone in Shadyside and.says
she feels very safe there. But she
did not always feel safe. Griffin
said her decision to move to
Shadyside was greatly effected by

 

Jamieson. - g

’’I didn't move to Shadyside
until he was caught,” said Griffin.
”I almost lost the apartment be-

she said.

”I was cautious before, and I'm
cautious now,” said Helen

”Last year it was the Shadyside
rapist, this year it was the I 5-year-
old in south Oakland. It's great
that they caught those two guys,

whether the streets are safer now

  THE an NEWS, Friday, February 13,1937

 

Help wanted--

Th i n king about fast food   

they just call them hamburgers?

I got hungry the other morning.
That's nothing new —— I get hun-
gry almost every morning. I
poked around at home, looking
for something to eat, and as it
says in the fairy tale, the cup-

’ board was bare.

Still hungry, and possessing
more initiative than usual, I went
out into the world in search of
food. On my way down the
street, I passed a number of gar-
ish, neon-clad eateries, all happy
to take my money in return for
whatever that particular culinary
Mecca was passing off as food.
My choice was McDonald's.

And a grim choice it turned out
to be. ,

It's not that McDonald's has a
particularly offensive formrof fast
food, or that the juvenile
atmosphere, punctuated by
clowns, detracted from the meal.
It was the sign outside. The sign
happily informed me that
McDonald's had ‘served some
large number of_ hamburgers,
McFishees, McThis_ees ‘ and
McThatees. About enough to give
everyone in the world, man
woman and child, about nine
meals.

Think about that. Think about
it in terms of raw materials for

I i that particular food factory. »

5.:

Assume they have sold 30 bil-
lion hamburgers. It's-a guess, but
probablynot too far off. If each
hamburger were a quarter pound,
that means that from a single
cow, assuming that all the meat
was turned into hamburgers,

lMA'I"l'HEW
THORNTON

 

which it isn't, you can get about
two thousand burgers. I guess
that means there are about 15
million dead cows behind that
claim. And that estimate is wild-
ly generous. k

It's OK though, I'm a carnivore,

» I can deal with a carnivorous

society.

Also implicit in the sign was the
number of times a person dressed.
in scratchy polyester» has given
someone a rolled up bag, a stag-
nating smile, a handful of change
and a worn thank you. I shudder
to think of it.

Consider the whole at-
mosphere. You walk in, stroll
past about a million people wolf-
ing down some indistinguishable
food product and up to a stainless
steel counter, populated by smil-
ing high school kids. They're

‘ mostly nice kids, earning money

for cars, proms and beer.
”Can I help you?"_A grin stands

behind the question likean en-'

dorsement. If someone can be
that close to the food and still be
smiling, it must be fit to eat. Hee
hee hee.

Behind them, beside the racks
of little pies in cardboard boxes,
turning slowly in the heat, there

r is a case of already assembled

sandwiches. «
"I'd like a Bic Mac,” I say, feel-
ing a little ridiculous. Why can't

"Any fries with that?” comes
the immediate reply. "Or maybe
a pie, or a shake, or a sundae, or
something to drink?” They rattle
these off with the grace of a
Shakespearean actor.

”Yes,” I say. ’’I think I'll have
some fries and a Coke.”

”Small, medium, large or super
Mcjumbo fries?” .

”Large,” I say, hoping I haven't
just invested in more grease than
I can eat. ‘

”What size drink? Small ...”

"Large,”"I say, cutting her off.
"Please, just give me a large."

”Creat," she says with a
delighted squeal. Now comes the
fun part of her job.

”That'll be $3.65,” she tells
me, hitting the total key. I hand
her the money and she returns
my change with the fabled thank
you. Turning to face the food lim-
bo of the heating case, she picks
up a styrofoam box, a cardboard
container, apaper cup, a paper
napkin, a plastic straw and a foil
package of ketchup. Throwing
the whole th row-away assembly

into, a paper bag, she hands it to

me, grinning all the while. It
might be my imagination,,but she
looks like she's gloating.

Come to think of it, I neversee
them eating the food.

After an almost satisfying meal,
and an encounter with a smiling _
garbage can that can adequately
be described as embarassing, I
left. There was no doubt in my
mind. She was gloating.

Condomation. is foolish  

Toothpaste prevents gum dis-
ease. It keeps people from getting
painful red gums which are real-
ly disgusting, so by all means,
let's advertise it on television.

Nasal spray keeps peoples’
noses from running. Nothing’s
worse than a lunch date with
someone who's got mucous all
over his or her face, so by all
means, let's advertise it on tele-
vision.

Jock itch spray keeps athletes
hands out of their pants, which is
embarrassing, so by all means,
let's advertise it on television.

Feminine hygiene products do
whatever it is they do, and God
knows it's a better world because
of them, so by all means, adver-
tise them on television.

Condoms prevent virtually ev-
ery venereal disease known to

humanity, especially AIDS, but
the people who use them use-

them so that they can havesex
without the risk of pregnancy,
and that's immoral. We can't
condone immoral, unnatural sex-
ual activity, so by all means,
don't advertise condoms on tele-
vision. -
The number of cases of AIDS
grows with each day. Only a year
ago, it was thought that only
homosexuals, intravenous drug
users and transfusion recipients
were at risk for contracting this
disease, but that is no longer the
case. Just being sexually active
puts you in the "at risk" category.
Medical technicians are work-
ing round the clock to find a vac-
cine, a cure or both for this
soon-to-be epidemic. There are
occasional, brief glimpses of suc-
cess, but liberal estimates for a
cu_re say it is at least five years

away. Thousands will die be-
tween now and then. Is there
nothing we can do?

Consider the condom — a sim-
ple device that's been around for

centuries and has been proven to

prevent the transmission of AIDS.
Widescale use of the condom
could be exactly what we need
to hold off the spread of AIDS un-
til medical science finds a cure.

However, selling condoms in
gas station men's rooms and ‘in
the pages of skin magazines is not

going to promote the wide scale
increase of their use that is neces-
sary. The condom industry has to
come out of the dark ages. Make
that, our society has to come out
of the dark ages.

Fundamentalists may wail and
moan about condoning sexual
practices that run counter to
"God’s Law." I think that con-
taining a killerydiseaseis more
pleasing to God than following a
series of illogical behavior res-
trictions. .

Concerned parents will be up-
set because condom commer-
cials will corrupt their children.
If the average age of first sexual
experience "is somewhere be-
tween 11 and 13 years old, I
think the kids are already corrupt-
ed, and they need to see the com-
mercials as much as anyone.

All three major television sta-
tions in Pittsburgh refused to air
the ads only last week. Afraid of
offending their viewers, I guess.
WPXI will show Bud Dwyer blow
his headoff and claim it's not sen-

sationalising, but they will bury
their heads in the sand along with
everyone else when presented
with the chance to help the
public.

In US. News’ special report on
AIDS, it's said that since the AIDS
virus can take as long as 10 years
after transmission to bring on the
symptoms of the disease, people
can spread it without having any
idea they are carriers. So, in ef-
fect, when you sleep with some-
body, you're also sleeping with
everyone they've slept with for
the last 10 years. Pretty morbid
stuff.

But all is not lost. The use of a
condom, will significantly reduce
your chances of contracting the-
disease, and it will keep your
partners safe, too. Just to make
sure that everyone knows all of.
this vital information, condom
ads not only should be aired in
the major media, they must be.

And besides, everyone’s wear-
ing latex this season.

The University of Pittsburgh
Board of Trustees approved a
double-degree program to be
offered by the Graduate School of
Business in thefall of 1987.

This new program will incor-
porate the current master of bus-
iness administration degree with
a master of science in manage-
ment of information systems.

The M.B.A./M.S. dual program
is an indirect result of the $2 mil-
lion IBM grant, given to the
Graduate School of Business in
1986.

 

H.J. Zoffer, dean of the Gradu-
ate School of Business, said this
new degree will allow the school
”to produce a new breed of bus-
iness manager who has broadly-
based managerial competence

and is also skilled in the manage- -

ment and use of information and
information technology/’.
Besides the increased demand
in the job market for this type of
professional, Zoffer also said the
degree was important ”because
a manager who bridges the gap
between information systems
practitioners and general
managers cannot be effectively

Pitt or other accredited institu-
tions can complete the M.S. por-
tion of the degree.

The Board considered a fund-
raising idea presented by Trustee
William Genge, chairman of the
Institutional Development Com-
mittee. Genge described a 1987
campaign, in which his commit-
tee will attempt to collect about
$200 million — one million for
each year of Pitt's bicentennial.

In Wednesday's issue of the
Pittsburgh Press, Genge said,
”The bicentennial activities raise
Pitt's visibility and make a lot of

people conscious of Pitt's contri-

bution to the city, region, nation
and internationally.”

The trustee added that he
thought 1987 will be a record-
setting year in fundraising.

”We think the bicentennial has
helped get our message across
about the quality of the universi-

ty, and when that happens, peo-.

ple want to support us.”‘

The proposal will be voted on
during the May meeting of the
Board.

Earlier in the day the Student
Affairs and Academic Affairs
Committee met and listened to
reports from the University Place-
ment Service and the Office of In-
ternational Studies.

Geoffrey Wood, Director of In-
ternational Services under Stu-
dent Affairs, said the enrollment
of foreign students in the Univer-
sity is between 1,350 to 1,500.

These students are from about
100 countries around the world.

Wood also said 88 percent of
these foreign students are in the
graduate programs at Pitt.

”This is unusual because the
majority of foreign student in
other colleges are enrolled as un-
dergraduates,” Wood said.

”Our [Office of International
Services] two major roles are in
the administration area. We
evaluate foreign students’ creden-
tials and make recommendations
to the different schools and
departments. We also evaluate
the students’ financial needs.

”We assist foreign students
with whatever they care to bring
to our attention,” Wood said.

The Student Affairs and Aca-
demic Affairs Committee also
heard a report from Robert R.
Hopkins, director of the Univer-
sity Placement Service.

In his study, Hopkins found
that last year, employers hired
nursing, pharmacy and education
undergraduates from Pitt.

Approximately 98 percent of
pharmacy students from Pitt were
hired last year.

However, students graduating
in computer science and most
types of engineering did not find
jobs as easily. IBM hired only
three or four students.

Last year, there was also a
greater demand for students with
degrees in nursing and physical
therapy.

YORK, Pa. (AP) —— ”They're
back,” warns the girl in commer-
cials for Poltergeist ll.

But poltergeists are not the only
demons to have returned, if you
ask people concerned about
racism.

They're not just talking about
recent overt incidents of racial
hatred: the resurgance of the Ku
Klux Klan; a black man killed by
a car while escaping white as-
sailants in Howard Beach, N.Y.;
racial hazing by students at The
Citadel.

What also concerns them is
something seemingly innocent
and thus more insidious than
those acts of violence.

Objectives and values of Pitt's

Creek System were recently dis-
_c,ussae_d and reinforced at the an-
nual Greek Presidents’ Conference,
at the Hidden Valley" Conference
Center.

”One of the main things was to
get them to learn to communi-
cate,” said Craig Jackson, public
relations representative for the in-
terfraternity Council.

The conference program was
organized over two days. Issues
discussed included university
policies and there impact on
Greek organizations, chapter cri-
sis management, personality
types and leadership styles, effec-
tive Greek communications,
Greek values, image building, or-
ganization and time man-
agement.

No specific issues, relative to
any fraternity’s or sorority’s be-
havior at Pitt, were mentioned at
the conference. Each participant
was given a President's Manual
outlining all university policies.

”We went over different na-
tional policies and how those af-

Guernsey, Greek adviser an_d as-
sistant director of student ac-

plicable.

How threatening is a figurine of
a black kid with a watermelon or
rag doll with copious pigtails?

”Such things seem innocent at
first,” said Julia Harris, principal
of Lincoln Elementary School and
a York black historian. ”Those lit-
tle badges the Jews wore in Ger-
many seemed innocent at first.”

”lt’s the implication of what it
stands for,” Simpson said. ”l
thought we'd grown past” the im-
age of blacks as servile, debased,
stupid and irrepressibly happy.

”A pejorative stereotype is au-
tomatically harmful,” said Joseph
Boskin, author of Sambo: The
Rise and Demise of an American
/ester (Oxford University Press).

”They’re more dangerous
when they're repetitive because

they reinforce the subconscious,”
said Boskin, a professor of histo-
ry and Afro—American studies at
Boston University. ‘

Not_everyone agrees.

Although they do not carry
such works at their Hand & "Eye
Gallery in East Berlin, Pa., white
artists Briggs and Susan Gettys
see nothing wrong with ‘the
returning popularity of what he
calls an ”aesthetic tradition.”

”They’re just a replication of
what did exist,” Gettys said. ”lt’s
a point of historical fact those
things existed. —

”They may have been simpler
times,” Harris said. ”But I certain-
ly don't long for them.’’.

’’I think partly it's nostalgia,"
Boskin said. ”There’s a strong
strain of nostalgia in America. We
replicate a lot of things from the
past '—’like- art deco. But art deco
is not demeaning to anyone.”

”The stereotypes that angered
blacks for so many generations
are not welcomed by them
now," said’ Russel L. j Adams,
chairman of Afro—American

‘studies at Howard University.

they are now.

. John Wright's fat old Aunt Jemi-
ma with the cloth: wrapped
around her head may swallow
money these days. But she
doesn't make pancakes anymore.

Today's Aunt Jemima trade-
mark looks more like Betty
Crocker with a tan. Everything
about her has been trimmed —
her nose, her lips, her figure, her
age. "The trademark has been
modernized,” said Ronald Bot-
trell, senior manager of public
communications for Quaker Oats
in Chicago. But this was not be-
cause of public pressure, he
stated.

Back in the 1960s there had
been a move to have Aunt Jemi-
ma removed altogether, he said
of a time that preceded his em-
ployment with the firm.

"But you don't just throw out
a trademark that is over 100 years
old and symbolizes the best-
selling pancake mix in the world;

a trademark that is recognized
and respected by millions of peo-
ple and generations of families
overnight," he said. "You simply
don't do that."

Just like Betty Crocker, the
"real” Auntjemima has changed

 with ' the. times.- _ . -

But not the "new" old‘ Aunt

. Jemimas that are being produced

as folk art. ,

And to Harris it's "just another
example of racism creeping in,
creeping in until we're right back
where we were.

"People tell me I'm the prophet
of doom,” she said. "But I feel
we've gone -back 20 years.”

She is not alone.

The "State of Black America,”
an annual report released recent-
ly by the National Urban League,
offers a ‘similarly bleak assess-
ment of the current status of civil
rights.

"Black Americans enter 1987
besieged by the resurgence of
raw racism, persistent economic
depression and the continued
erosion of past gains,” league
president John Jacob said. "We
can't forget that for six years and
more, Americans have been told
that racism is a thing of the past,
and that poverty is caused by the
habits of the poor.”

"\Nith all due respect to the
[Reagan] administration, there
has been an atmosphere that

. givéslborderline folks and silent

racist types a little more security,”
Adams, said.

No group is safe from negative
stereotyping, warned Harris. "Af—
ter they finish with the black man,
they'll come after the Jews, the Ir-
ish, the |talians."

A case could bemade that this .

has already happened, she said,
pointing to a legislator's recent
"slip on the Italians."

' State Rep. Donald Dorr (R-
York) reportedly said that if Penn-
sylvania sold its state liquor stores
they would be taken over by
"Sicilians."

He later apologized, the prin-
cipal said, "But like the kids say,
'Sorry don't do it.’ " '

Gettys thinks those who fear a
return of past prejudices are miss-
ing the point of the art form.

'’I don't think they're meant to
be racist," she said. "lt's just that
a lot of people find the 21 st cen-
tury threatening."

Adams finds his memories of a
South Georgia childhood where
"the Klan was [and, recent events
revealed, still is] so common they
didn't have to hide their faces”
far more fr_ightening. ’

However, Adams attributes the

current resurgence of demeaning

black artifacts to "mistaken judg-
ment" and "naivete” rather than
any malicious premeditation.
"|t's a case of social amnesia," he
said.

Most students don't think o_f
their professors as having per-
sonal lives, let alone doing any-
thing special for Valentine's Day.
However, there are two profes-
sors at Pitt who will be spending
the day together.

Lynn Emmanuel and. Jeffrey
Schwartz have been married for
11 years. Emmanuel is a poetry
teacher in the English Depart-
ment and Schwartz teaches hu-
man evolution in the
Anthropology Department.

The two met in Manhattan,
N.Y., while Schwartz was a
graduate student and Emmanuel
was working in between earning
degrees.

Emmanuel said her husband al-
ways gives her wonderful cards
for Valentine's Day. "They're
very funny ones that make me
laugh, and he signs them in all
kinds of insane ways," she said.

This Valentine's Day, Em-
manuel plans to give her husband
an original poem. She said the
best gift she ever gave him was
"not making him cook dinner."

Schwartz said she made hi_m a
dinner complete with wine. "Our
schedules are so busy. We make
it up as we go along, and if it falls
on the right day, that's all the bet-
ter," he said. ,

Valentine's Day for Lynn Em-
manuel and Jeffrey Schwartz will
be a special day when they can
enjoy each. others company, in
spite of their busy schedules.

Three different bands. Three different stories.

thing new and interest-
ing. We make democratic
music in the sense that
it is not inaccesible."

- Stephen Morrison

Amadeus

Wolfgang goes
for the usto in the
Pitt Stu io Theater's
production of
Amadeus

Hector in Paris will open next
Saturday's WPTS New Music
Fest. '

But, wait. The new music fest
is in Oakland, not Paris. And
who is this guy Hector?

Hector in Paris is a four person
band (it used to be five and soon
will be again), who took their
name from the Greek classic The

///‘ad.

Phil Harris, the soft-spoken.‘

lead singer of Hector, relates the
story. ‘

"Jim was looking through a
copy of The //iad, and he said,
’l’ve always liked the names
Hector and Paris,’ and I thought
he said Hector in Paris. I said,
'That's it! That's it!’

”So we thought about it for l 0
seconds, and that was it."

But describing Hector in Paris’
music is not so easy. They have

‘two keyboard players and a

drum computer, which probably
contributes to their dance—synth
label.

But they have also been la-
beled anywhere from aggravat-

 

ed pop music to angst with a
beat

The fact is, the band's music is
danceable rock, but Phil Harris
does not think of the music as
purely synthetic.

Guitar is a dominant part of
their music, which you don't find

-in synth bands. And they also

have a sax player.

Harris maintains his band is not
purely a dance band. "There
are subjects that you normally
wouldn't find [in dance music],"
he said. "We have music -that
appeals to people physically, so
they can dance, and mentally,
so you get them listening as well.

We're able to tie the two’

together so that once we get the
bodies relaxed, you can listen to
the lyrics."

Harris is the band's principle

' songwriter and has been writing

lyrics since the age of l4.

He rarely writes songs that are
happy and considers himself a
realist.

"Every song that l write is
about a relationship, whether it's
between an individual to his [ob
or to society. I tend to mask

through a fanatical '
dream, and _

things — it's just the way'l

write." .

Hector in Paris’ plans for the
future include releasing an al-
bum, something The Affordable
Floors have ‘accomplished and
The Cynics are in the process of
doin .

"After all," said Harris, "we
have to keep up with the
Joneses." .

'Hector's immediate plans are,
of course, the WPTS Music Fest.
So what kind of preview could
the —band give of the upcoming
show?

"We're fun to dance to,
we're fun to listen to do, and
we're fun to get drunk to. That
pretty much covers everything
that people do," Harris said.

* * * 3|‘ *

The second band in the line—up
of the WPTS Music Fest is The
Cynics, whose music is a dras-
ticcontrast to the danceable
pop music of Hector in Paris.
What Hector is to danceable

op music, the Cynics are to
loud rock 'n' roll.

 

In fact, The Cynics main attrib-
ute is their loudness.’

But loudness and emotion_

seems to be the main attribute of
all garage bands, and The Cyn-
ics proudly place themselves into
that category. The reason this

type of music is called garage

music is because many of the
bands in the ',60s literally played
and practiced in garages.

The Cynics are inspired by un-
derground music from i966.

From a dimly lit, graffiti-covered _'

upstairs room in the Electric
Banana, Gregg Kostelich, who
plays lead guitar, and Bill von
Hagen, who plays drums (or, as
he puts it, concussion), explain

why the year i966 has had .

such an impact on the band. '
" l 966 was taken to be a
representative year of a certain
stage in the evolution of rock. It
was a year that a lot of original,
kind of music was happening/'\
Kostelich almost angrily, adds,
"Then all the manufactured.—type

shit came out. l 966 was the last ‘
great year, the summer of hates».

stanze Weber—l\/lozart give

By Laura Montuoro

he cast of Amadeus, in
the Studio Theatre's
most recent production,
does a fine job en-
livening Peter Shaffer’s script.

Amadeus, with its complex
characters, is amazingly well
performed by a group of un-
dergraduates.

The script requires the main
character, Antonio Salieri,
played by David l\/leaders
Klein, to address the audience
in the midst of a scene during
which he is.a central charac-
ter. All the other actors freeze ,
in position, while Salieri be-
comes commentator.

" Thescript also contains
flashbacks that force Klein to
portray Salieri as both a
young and old man.

These peculiarities of the
script account for Klein's un-
convincing opening night per-

 

intermission. Klein's role as
commentator explain why he
appears distracted,‘ sometimes
confused and far too aware
of the audience.

Although Salieri’s character
is shaky at the beginning of
Amadeus, Klein's performance
improves and his character

builds as the play moves on.
He works out all the bugs, af-
ter Salieri’s nervous collapse
— which, unfortunately, '
wasn't at all believable. This
could be blamed on choices '

' Oddly enough, Klein is at

when Salieri delivers a *
blasphemous soliloquy. After
the break, Klein's Salieri im-

made by director James Cali. proves, yet he does show
signs of wear and tear’ as the
his best just after his collapse, difficult role takes its toll.

When the Ramones started
playing, sometime in l974, they
didn't see‘ themselves as com-

with the likes of Aerosmith, Ted
Nugent and Kiss. Probably the
closest they ever got to entering
that arena was an offer to warm
up for Foreigner at Notre Dame,
and the school rejected them.

The big leagues of '70s rock
was clearly out of the question.
Radio programmers weren't like-

mental illness and household in-
toxicants. But this wasn't the end
of the Ramones, only the begin-

British punk explosion of T977.
They soon became a big cult

Cult status for many bands is
not only a limitation but the first
sign of a short lived career. For
the Ramones, it's been different.
They haven't fought with their
limitations or their established im-

consciously to maintain and
foster them. .

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, February 13, 1987

Hey ho let's gal!

A dream trip traipsing through
a fanatical concert performance

once you get used to the manic
tempo, you'll recognize their
classic pop sensibility. The lyrics
are always crazy and often self-
referential, and singer Joey
delivers them like a mis—cloned
Elvis.

Their live shows, although
they've intended to proiect their
image as the only "true"
rock'n'roll act left, are complete-
ly unpretentious and nonindul—

gent. There are no long solos, _

no new arrangements and no
frills ever. They are in the busi-
ness of delivering exactly what
their fans want — the Ramones.
They play more songs in an hour
and a half than most bands can
play in three or four. Songs are
played — one after another -
almost running into each other.
Ironically, as the Ramones ap-
proach their fifteenth year as a
band, their records are sounding
more and more like the original
three. And thus the upsurge in
their popularity seems much akin
to that which followed the rein—
troduction of original formula

- Classic Coke. But this surely

comes as no suprise to the band.
Their career in rock'n'roll was
based on the assumption that
people like the "real thing" and
know when they hear it. The Ra-
mones, if nothing else, are "the
real thing."

It was aggresive. It was how
punk was in '77.” . ‘
The Cynics upcoming album,
B_/ue "Train Station, contains five
cover songs taken from that

same '60s period. The other

seven songson the album are
originals, written by Kostelich
and Michael Kastelic, the
band's lead singer.

Kostelich handles’ the musical
end, while Michael writes the
lyrics, which range in subject
from personal relationships to
having a nice day.

Kostelich outlined the process.
"When we send out singles, we

"We didn't set out to make it

If The Cynics music'is retro-
gressive, then The Affordable
Floors’ music must be described
as futuristic. This band wants to
take advantage of today's tech-
nology to expand their music.

Kirk Botula, the band's key-
boardist, and Steve Morrison,
guitarist and vocalist, explained
their use of modern technology.
”The guitar is still a valid in-
_, ent, b_ut sythesizers and
oard technology have so
t—stripped what you can

 doiiwith a guitar - if you don't

use sythesizers, you are cons-
ciously being - retrogressive,"
Morrison said.

”You can be much more artic-
ulate with sythesizers. We are
interested in using the new tech-
nology to push the limits of what
rock music is and to keep
redefining it," he continued.

The Affordable Floors have
iust released their debut album,

The band seems very satisfied
with the album and are hoping
to use it as a springboard to
show people what they can do.

They are also satisfied with the
production of the album, but
they are quick to point out the
differences between the band
on the album and the band live.
On the album you can hear a lot
of nuances in the music that you
normally would not hear live. But
at the same time, the album
does not have a live edge. The
Floors are much more powerful
live; they are more beat orient-
ed and muchmore aggresive.

.One of the songs on the album

is adapted from a poem by e.e.,

Cummings, which stems from the
band's being influenced by
writers more so than by other
musIcIans.

Another song on the album,
"A Passion Not Known,” is
based on the play Equus, and
"Geneva" was thematically
based on The Tin Drum but only
in the sense that it was a novel
about obiect obsession.

The Floors are leery of talking"
about their literary influences be-

cause ”it might sound lpreten-:,.‘=

tious,” but then Botula asserts -_

that literature is where their in-

terests lie. ' _

Botula and Morrison take this 
further. "We are more interest— _, .

ed in makingsongs that are

meaningful to people," Botula . _

said. -

"We're not trying to be some 7 

intellectual, esoteric band that
makes music you can't under-

stand," said Morrison. "We 

want to make music that anyone
can understand, but that, hope-
fully, says something new and
interesting. We make democrat-
ic music in the sense that it is n
inaccesible. I I

”But to do something that 

people can identify with doesn't
mean you have to use common-

place ideas or ways of articulat- v

ing it musically. We try to make
intelligent music, not intellectual
music.”

When asked about the band's
future goals, Kirk Botula replied,

”Our real goal is to have our '

music played on elevators.

Then, everyone will know we ‘

really made it."

Amerika takes  

over the airwaves

By Bob Travers

Television is dominated by

Amer/'/<0 this week, one of the . _
longest and most contoversial.

mini-series ever to air. Ameri/<0,
beginning at 9 p.m. this Sunday
on Channel 4 and continuing
nightly through the "following
Sunday, is the story of the Unit-
ed .States LO years after the
Soviet Union invaded and cap-
tured the nation in a near blood-

less coup.
lt seems that Americans were
becoming _ lethargic and

apathetic about little things like
freedom and civic responsibility,
and we just let the Russians

- come in and walk all over us.

Left intentionally vague is ex-'
actly how the Soviets were able
to take over but, as one KGB
agent explains, ”You lostyour
country before we ever got
there." Ouch.

The show has been bombard-

ed by criticism from both the po— .

litical left, who say theseries will
be nothing more than another
example of Rambo-influenced
commie—crushing, and from the

   

   

  
    

  

right, who worry over the liber-
al philosophy of some of the
characters and the portrayal of
the United Nations as a tool of
the Soviet Union.

'\

The Soviets themselves got in

on the act when they threatened
to close ABC's Moscow bureau
if the network went through with
the proiect. 2

‘The controversy could not
have ABC officials happier. The
bottom line for any network, es-
pecially a last place one like
ABC, is not how many people
like a program, but how many

. watch it.

The l 98o—87’television season
is more than halfway over, and

.. You might want to sit down for this — John Melloncamp

Don't lose any sleep;  An extremely unpredictable band ' I
called Negativeland will soon release a record featuring a
A dead-boy union of sorts. For the first time ever, The Dead
Kennedys and The Grateful Dead~will perform together on
vinyl. Look for it in the next few weeks.  Also on the ”Dead"
front, The Dead Milkmen, following in the footsteps of their"
heroes, Cheap Trick and Bob Dylan, will be calling their next
LP live at Budo/(an. Maybe we'll hear ”Bitchin’ Toyota.” 
The Replacements’ next record is done, too. It'll be out in early
April.  Local rockers Eighteen Names will release their debut
LP Armed and Ready in mid—March.  The U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service will be making it more difficult for
artists to get H—l visas to perform in the States. The new criteria
I will seriously affect new andgalternative artists. C'mon, music
fans, call your congressperson.  l haven't been in this city

long, but it doesn't take any gre

at observational power to no-

tice that there is a major case of local music apathy among
Pittsburgh's youth. There are many, many talented and en-
tertaining musicians here. Most perform at clubs within a TO
to. l 5 minute walking distance of Pitt's dorms or apartments.
Write to me. Tell me why you don't see local bands. If you're
a local musician, tell me something about your band. This

D. Boone’s death

"Punkrock changed our
lives,” D. Boon song of himself
and his Minutemen bandmate

proving there were more possi-
bilities for the genre than having
someone scream cliched social

beat.

of music, but firehose — featur-
ing Minutemen drummer George
Hurley and bassist Mike Watt —
proves that much of the Minute-
men’s spirit lives on in this dy-
namic new musical duo.

Ed Crawford ‘(identified as ed
fROMOHlO on the record
sleeve) joins Watt and Hurley to
form firehose. While Crawford's
choppy, iangly-sounding guitar
work owes much to Boon, his
clear, powerful voice is unique-
ly his own.

He tears into Mike Watt’s
short, angry lines that comprise
the album-opening ”Brave Cap-

tain,” declaring: There are-

doubts in your abi/ity, too many
blanks in your ana/ogies.

He is equally effective singing
his own quiet acoutic piece
”This  .” B

There is an undeniable believ-
ability in Crawford's young
voice that makes itengaging for
now — potentially even greater
(look out!).

As always, Mike Watt’s bass
playing proves decidedly un-
conventional and movingly fran-
tic in firehose.~ In combination
with George Hurley's steady,
variously—styled drumming, the
two create one of rock's most
accomplished and talented
rhythm sections.

From the dynamic passages of
”The Candle And The Flame" to
the tense, explosive "Chemical
Wire," Watt and Hurley show
themselves to be vital to their

‘band and not iust ornamental

backing players.

Decidedly different from much
of the work of the Minutemen,
Ragin’, Fu//—On, of course, still
draws on many similar influences
and recalls the band's incredible
work with singer/guitarist Boon.

While Boon will always be
missed, that his former partners
can create a record this vital and

forward—looking makes his loss 
that much less difficult to accept.

STILL STANDING
Jason and The
Scorchers

EMI

By Ike Shibley

With so much ”wimp” rock
circulating recently in the form of
Bon Jovi, Boston and Cinderel-
la, it is refreshing to hear a band
like Jason and The Scorchers.

They have a solid rock sound
that hgs its roots in the bars of

THE__PITT NEWS,” Frida)c..-Eebmaijy   13,...19e7

 

Tennessee. They have no flash
or pretention about them. They
are the epitome of what many a
critic has called ”meat-and-

, potatoes rock ’n’ roll."

The rhythms are simple. Gui-
tar chords are far from intricate.
The lyrics contain meaning be-
tween the lines but not much on-
line. Yet, the music is energetic
and grabs the listener im-
mediately.

The first three songs — ”Gold—
en Ball and Chain," ”Crashin’
Down" and ”Shotgun Blues" —
are vigorous, lively numbers. All
three are dynamite. They are the
best songs on the album be-
cause of their straight—forward

rock approach.

Their rendition of ”l 9th Ner-
vous Breakdown” adds nothing
to the original, but it still plays
well. ”Ocean of Doubt" is a

slower song that tells of what I

shou/a’ have been. lt is the best

LES

attempt at a melodious love
song on the album. ,

The rest of the album is some-
what dull in relation to the first
three songs. '

Perry Braggs loses a little en-
thusiasm on the drums. The notes
are not crisp or distinct. Warner
Hodges’ guitar likewise loses
some fire. His chords become
uninspired and somewhat flat.

Jason Ringberg sings well on
every song. He wrote most of
the music, which allows him to
sing with more emotional pow-
er. He adds a toughness to each

song thatmelts in with the music

of the band.

Sti// Standing is inconsistent.
Some songs are much better
than others, but even the incon-
sistent songs are respectable.
They hold true to their bar-band
sound. So much here is good
that the likeable qualities on the
album far outweigh the others.

With song titles like,
”Where’s My Legs,” "He's

mother is suffering from Alzheim-

SNFU has more to sing about
than drug-induced bliss with their
girlfriends. This record radiates
deeper meaning, set to scream-
ing guitar and a thrashing
rhythm.

My suggestion: turn it up real
loud and shank around the room

Smith's

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

At the beginning of the sea-
son, critics touted Charles
Smith as one of the best play-
ers the Panthers have ever
had.

He was. ' ‘

Then, in the middle of the
season, just a few weeks ago,
these same critics came down
hard on Smith who appeared
to be in a low—scoring and
shooting slump.

He was.

A But now, with the end of

4 one of the best regular seasons

the Panthers have ever had

~ just around- the corner,. is

Smith back to his old self
again?

He is.

’’Charles is back, and every-
one knows it,” said Panther
head coach Paul Evans recent-

25 points and collected 17 re-
bounds to beat Providence
87-81. ”He knows his" role,
and in most of the games, he

powerful player who can be
quite intimidating on the
court. When he plays, he can
be extremely explosive.”
This idea of role playing

and it is a concept which
Smith and every otherplayer
on the team understands.

”Everyone on the team
knows that they each have cer-
tain roles to play,” said Smith,
who is averaging 17.2 points
and 8.9 rebounds per game
this season.

”The thing we all had to
learn, and at first it wasn't
easy, was to find out just.what
each of our specific roles are.
This came with a lot of dis-
cipline and excellent coach-

ly, after Smith had just scored"

has been playing it to perfec-
tion. He is a strong and very_

comes straight. from Evans,‘

perfect

used to doing them and are
comfortable with them. By do-

ing so, we've all opened up a .

lot more options for our-
selves.’-’

Smith, a 6-10, junior center
from Bridgeport, Conn., feels
very much at ease with the po-
sition the Panthers are in at this
point in the season. Currently
Pitt (20-4 overall and 9-2 in the

Big East) is ranked 10th in the _

Associated Press poll and
should climb at least two more
notches by next week. Also,
the first place Panthers have a
bully chance at capturing the
Big East title, someth'ing"Smith
has been waiting for sincehe
came to Pitt. _

”I really can't tell you what
it feels like to be in this spot,”
Smith-said after clinching the
Syracuse victory Monday with
two foul shots in the final eight
seconds. ”The best part about
it is that you know this doesn't
come easy, and it's still not go-
ing to get any easier until the
end of the season, but the hard
work really pays off. I hope I
can never forget this feeling of
true accomplishment”,

This accomplishment, how-
ever, was not too evident a
few weeks ago, especially in
the St. John's game on Jan. 19

A where Smithwas making mis-
take after bad play after
mistake. .

What a night it wasn't for
him, and some said it might
just-have been the beginning
of a-trend. Well, it obviously
was not trend setting, but
Smith even feels the idea he
was in a slump should be
negated. , .

”Maybe I had one off game
because I didn't score a Iot,"
he said, ”but I certainly don't
think I was in any kind of__a_

By Vince Carey
' Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
will face Penn'State —— its tough-
est opponent of the season —

~- tomorrow night at Peters Town-

ship High School at 7:30.

The Panthers are currently
ranked '17th by the Amateur
Wrestling News with a 10-2 over-

all record and 2-2 in the Eastern '
Wrestling League. Penn State is

  
  
  

ranked second in the country and
has a record of 14-1-1 overall and
2-0 in the EWL.

”This is a large order for the
weekend,” said Pitt head coach

Rande Stottlemyer. ”It is going to '

be tough. We'll just go out there,
work our ends off and give them
hell. I just hope that our guys give
their best.” . ,

Although Pitt is ranked much -

Tniéltrntniews, Friday, February 13, 1987“

We're all given opportunities at
one time or another. Some in-
dividuals are presented with very
few, while others have the world
attheir fingertips. But regardless
of degree or number, opportuni-
ties are hollow unless they are
grasped and held with the tighest
clench. They may only come
once. ’

It's been only two years since
Brian Davis signed a letter-of-
intent to play football for the

"University of Pittsburgh. And al-

ready his name has become lost,
hidden in the passing of the 1986
season. Scholastic failure claims
another victim.

What exactly was the cause of
this mishap? Was it the coaches’
fault, or an academic advisor’s
shortcoming? Most who know

bright individual, so the college

lworkload wasn't really beyond

his capabilities. His lack of self-
application comes clearer and
clearer into view. When he came
to school, Davis just didn't try.
No sense in disguising the truth.
As a result, he won't be seen in
a Panther uniform until 1988, if
even

'I' III OM A S
DANYLIIK

 

Here is an individual who had
the world in his reach. Two years
ago Davis was considered the
best prep running back in the
United States. Every college pro-
gram wanted him. Sports Illustrat-
ed rated him as one of the five
best prospects in high school. Pa-
rade magazine named ‘him its Co-
Player of the Year. '

Davis’ bedroom is certainly
swelling with trophies, plaques,
certificates and all sorts of athlet-
ic awards. Seems they've all gone
to waste. You know, dust collec-
tors. But at this point, they're all
that's left. The cheers and raves
that were once directed his way
have faded. And the future, at
least football—wise, is as empty as
Pitt Stadium at midnight.

Nagging injuries slowed him
for most of his freshman year. Yet
against Boston College, Davis did
football fans a great disservice; he
showed them a little bit of what
he could do with the football.

Remember his whirling—dervish
of a touchdown run in that game?
A 26-yard shot up the middle gar-
nished with,_ not one, but two
360-degree spins on the way to
the end zone. Shades of Tony
Dorsett, with ‘a twist of Earl
Campbell.

That, one run got Panther fans’
hopes sky high. Yeah, we all
thought, this guy is a real magi-
cian. Here's the glitter that Pitt
football has been lackingsince
Danny Marino played. Turn him
loose, Foge.

Then Davis did his disappear-
ing act. ’ '

Thank heaven for Craig Hey-
ward, even though he too had a
foot out the door at one time.
Luckily, Heyward straightened
himself out and had a great 1986
season.

Could you see it? Davis and
Heyward cocked in the same
backfield? ”Double Trouble,” the
papers would celebrate. ”Pitt’s
dynamic duo rumbles over
whomever!”

A tough defense and a power-
ful rushing attack gave Penn State
a national championship. Davis
could have completed a similar
combination for the Panthers. But
what could have been, wasn't.

Oh, Davis still has a little time
to correct the situation. He can
transfer to a junior college now,
and if he does well scholastical—
ly, he could be back in uniform
for 1987. Or,'he could sit out
another year and play. in '88.
Whichever, his key to the locker
room is buried within the
textbooks.

The situation raises a puzzling,
double-edged. question: Which is
worse — to have the world and
lose it or to never have it"at all?

Davis seems to be acquainted

: with-‘lat least one side‘of-the story.

makes fantastic plays.”

One of the biggest problems
Gottfried faced last _season was
the lack of depth at quarterback.
Joe Felitsky and Sal Genilla will
be entering their senior seasons
next fall, and sophomore Larry
Wanke is the only other under-
classman returning. But, Gottfried
went out and added three more
quaterbacks to his roster.

‘ 

We've got a really
good class this year.
They're not only tough
players, but they're
smart kids. This _will
bring pride back to our
program. /

— Mike Gottfried

'-"""-"_' 9 9
Alongwith quarterbacks Yusef

Washington, a four-year letter-~

man from Duquesne High
School, and Dean El-Attrache, a
two-year letterman from Mt.
Pleasant, Gottfried was able to
sign Darnell Dickerson of Detroit,
the Michigan Player of the‘ Year.
”D'arne|l Dickerson is one of
the finest athletes I've ever
recruited,” said Gottfried.
”We’ve promised him a chance
at the quarterback position along
with Yusef Washington and Dean
El-Attrache. We feel like we've
also answered our needs at that
position.” .
Gottfried is a little concerned

  THE PITT NEWS, Friday, February 13, 1937.

with the fact that Dickerson, who
is a very fine baseball player,
could get a contract offer from a

. professional baseball club. But he

did say that, at this point, Dick-
erson is very contented with be-
ing a football player.

"Dickerson is an all—around
athlete who basically can do
whatever he wants in any sport,”
said Gottfried. "I saw a photo of
him with a baseball glove on one
hand, a football helmet on his
head and a basketball in the other
hand. But what makes me happy
is that he really wants to be a
football player, and, what can I
say, he's the best athlete in the
city of Detroit.”

Gottfried feels one of the best
points about this recruiting year
is that he was able to attract ex-
actly one half of the class from
Pennsylvania, and the majority of
the others from surrounding
states such as Ohio and New.Jer-
sey. He said; he hopes to continue
this same pattern in the future.

Gottfried also said that many of
his recruits are not only fine ath-
letes but good scholars as well.
At least eight of. them have cum-
mulative GPA’s of over a 3.5 and
high board scores.

One recruit, Mike Boykin, a
linebacker from Dayton, Ohio,
has an average of 4.2 on a 4.0
scale. Gottfried said that Propo-
sition 48 did not hurt his recruit-
ing efforts as much as he thought
it might.

”We’ve got a really good class

this year,” said Gottfried.
”They’re.not only tough players,
but they're smart kids. This will
bring pride back to our program.”

optimistic about team

By Tom Spray

For The Pitt News

Sometimes, good teams have
to overcome obstacles to be suc-
cessful. The Pitt Panther wrestling
team is no different. Just when the
Panthers seemed ready to make
a serious run at the Eastern
Wrestling League Championship,
they ran into a problem.

The Panthers’ championship
hopes were dealt a serious blow
when senior heavyweight Curtis
Conner was lost for the season af-
ter suffering a detached retina in
his right eye last week. He had
surgery on the eye last Friday.

Conner suffered the injury last

Wednesday but, interestingly, he .

wasn't even wrestling at the time.

Conner explained, ”Every
Wednesday, we have an active
rest day’ where instead of
wrestling, we work on our cardio-
vascular system by playing other
games. '

' ”Last Wednesday, we were
playingvolleyball with about six
or seven balls and, while I was
watching one coming at me in
the air, another one thrown at me
hit me right in the eye.”

For Conner, who was coming
off one of his bigger wins — a de-
cision of Navy's John DeVineon
Feb. 1 — the eye injury forced an
early end to his career.

I thought I could have had a good
year. I think I evenlhad an outside
chance of making nationals.”
Pitt coach Rande Stottlemyer
echoed Conner’s sentiments. ”It’s
a big loss, and I feel bad for the
team, but I feel worse for Curtis
because it's his senior year, and

» he's done now.” .
Conner sported a 15-10-2 in- .
dividual record and was filling a,

key role for the 17th-ranked Pan-
thers at the heavyweight division.
The loss of Connor leaves the
Panthers in a vulnerable position
in the upper weight classes. Go-
ing into tomorrow night's league
match against second-ranked
Penn State, Stottlemyer isn't sure
how he will fill the void.
’ Conner, though, expects the
Panthers to move sophomore
Mark Stoner to the 190-division,
a jump of two weight classes, and
freshman Chris Nufher to heavy-

.weight.

As for the league title, Stott-
lemyer is still optimistic. ”Curtis
was a fortress up above and
without him now, we have to win
the swing matches — the toss-
ups,” said Stottlemyer.

Conner feels the team can
overcome his loss. ’’I think they
can still win it. They might be
weak in the higher weight class-
es, but they can still win it,” said
Conner.

heart of their order, but the other
guys have been doing really well
lately. Especially [Matt] Rizzo
[118-pounds] I've been hearing
good things about him.”

Stottlemyer, for one, can't wait
for this match. ”We’ve had to
juggle our line—up a bit because
of the injury to Curtis [Conner]
and a little bit of the flu that's go-

ing. around,” said Stottlemyer.
”But our guys will be ready. They \

have great coaches as well as  "

great wrestlers, but I really think
that we can pull it off.”  =

Gonzalez having 'all-around’ year

By Sharon Haney

' ’ - Staff Writer

Pitt gymnast Jorge Gonzalez is
having a good year by his stan-

I ' dards — or for that matter any-

one’s. ”I’ve had somepretty good
meets! so far, but I haven't had a
great one yet," said Gonzalez, a
freshman all-arounder from
-Smithtown, N.Y. ”I know I can
score much better. ‘I need to be
more consistent." ' ,
Gonzalez got interested in

I gymnastics after watching it on

television when he was nine.
Since then, he's -done some very
impressive things in gymnastic
competitions. Gonzalez lettered
all four years in high school and,
during his junior and senior

H’ _r years, he made the Junior Nation-

  

 

al Championships. -

Then last March, Gonzalez and

his roommate at Pitt, freshman

Pat Pollaci, got the chance to
compete in Sweden. ”Pat and I
were chosen as part of a team to
represent the United States. There
were six other countries com pet-
ing,” said Gonzalez, who
finished first in his age group.

Gonzalez has continued his
high school success here atjPitt.
He has been the Panthers top all-
around performer in the last few
meets.

Obviously, Gonzalez’
presence is a plus for the men's
gymnastics team. But Gonzalez
came here because of the already.
high standards of the gymnastics
program. "Pitt has a‘ good gym-
nastics program. They have had
a lot of good all-arounders in the

past few years. Plus, it’s,a good .

place to get an education,” said
Gonzalez, who plans to major in
the field of Health Related
Professions.

The main person who in-’

fluenced Gonzalez’ gymnastics
career was Chuck LaCombe, with
a little help from Pollaci, who is
from Long Island, N.Y.
”[LaCombe] saw me in the high
school championships and asked
me if I'd like to train in his gym,
so I moved down to Long Island
and lived with my roommate Pat
and his family for a year and a
half. _
”Coach LaCombe taught me
most of the gymnastics I now
know. At least he taught ‘me all
of my high level skills. He set
goals for me which were almost
unattainable,__a_ggI__he got me to

The Pitt men's track team will
be splitting up this weekend be-
cause of two major invitationals
taking place in the East.

Friday night the Panthers will
travel to Edinboro University and
compete against Robert Morris,
Carnegie Mellon and host Edin-

will be there — particularly the
younger members of the team.

However, on Saturday Lee
McRae will compete in the

will be ‘Eric Cannon in the

mile relay team, which is made
up of Bob Weiner, Joe Daniels,
Dave Moore and Tim Manes.

"The Olympic Invitational and
the Millrose Games are similar,”
said Pitt men's track coach John
Vasvary. ”Some of the best com-
petition in the country will be
there.”

There will not only be some of
the best collegiate runners in the
country but some of the best run-
ning clubs as well. Runners such
as Carl Lewis and former Pitt
track star Roger Kingdom will be
in competition along with the
West Chester Puma Track Club,
which is considered one of the
best clubs in the United States.

On Sunday the George Mason
Invitational in Virginia will also
attract some major names. ‘Some
of the runners from the Olympic
Invitational will compete as well.

”We’re looking to get the hur-'
dles and the mile relay qualified "

for the nationals here,” Vasvary
said of the Mason Invitational.

said Boston College head coach
Margo Plotzke. "They just never
let up, which is a big change from
the last time we played them.”

Pitt lost at Chestnut Hill earlier
this year 91-55 allowing five Ea-
gles to score in -double figures.

This time, however, only 5-8
Boston College senior forward
Pam Thornton scored in double
figures, hitting five of 11 from the
field and finishing with 14 points.

Pitt junior forward Sally Sheer-

Probably more impressive was
the play of senior reserve fon/vard

five rebounds in only 23 minutes

fense and was real steady on
offense,” said Pitt coach Kirk
Bruce.

Overall Bruce was pleased
with his team's effort. ”I couldn't
be happier with their effort. Last

game they played hard about

three-fifths of the time. Tonight
they gave it their all.”

Panther freshman Jen Shingler
only had seven points in the
game. Bruce feels she has to
score more for the team to be suc-
cessful. "We need to get Jen
Shingler more into the offense,
we have to take advantage of her
skills,” said Bruce.

Shingler is currently shooting
86 percent from the foul line,
good enough for 12th in the na-
tion. But she missed a crucial
one-and-one that . could have
given Pitt a three-point advantage
with sixminutes left in the game.

The Lady Panthers play at
Robert Morris tomorrow after

Gonzalez feels the main differ-

ence between high school gym-
nastics and college gymnastics is

precision. "College gymnastics is ’
much more precise. The meets

are so close that every tenth of a
point counts," said Gonzalez.

Gonzalez’s favorite event, the ,

pommel horse, is also the most
difficult. "lt’s a challenge because
it's so frustrating. It's also very tir-

ing because there are no breaks

in your routine.” -

Gonzalez feels the fact that the
Panthers only. have three home
meets remaining, including one
next Saturday against Michigan

State, is not a disadvantage as the V --

team enters the latter part of the
schedule. ”Away meets are more
fun because you get away from

the same boring thing. I think‘ the "
team tries harder at away meets,-"'

said Gonzalez.
