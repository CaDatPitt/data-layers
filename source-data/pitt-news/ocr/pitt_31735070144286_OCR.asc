Diplomat
dissects
Georgian
conflict I

by Hayley Grgurich
Se/zior Stzzff IV/‘iter

Before serving as Georgia’s
ambassador to the United States,
Canada and Mexico, Vasil Sikhar—
ulidze worked as a physician and
psychiatrist.

In his introduction of the am-
bassador to the crowd in Posvar
I-Iall yesterday afternoon, direc-
tor of the Center for Russian and
East European Studies Robert
Hayden pointed out the similari-
ties between the ambassador’s past
and that of another psychiatrist-
turned—public—servant in att:en—
dance, Rep. Tim Murphy, who
represents Pennsylvania’s 18th
District.

“That’s right,” said Murphy,
who received his doctorate in psy-
chiatry from Pitt. ‘‘We’ll be doing
group therapy today.”

‘It might have been a joke, but
the lecture, titled “Georgia’s Place
in a Changing World,” was not un-
like a therapy session as the am-
bassador spoke of the challenges
facing the country: Russia’s bully-
ing and Georgia’s quest to become
part of the in—crowd through
NATO membership. ,

The lecture, jointly hosted
by the Center for Russian and
East European Studies, Euro-
pean Snidies Center & European
Union Center of Excellence and
the International Business Center
of Pitt’s Center for International
Studies, drew a crowd predomi-
nantly interested in Georgia’s rela-
tions with Russia in the wake of
the latter’s invasion this summer
and in Georgia’s continuing at-
tempts to join NATO.

After some brief historical
background on the country, the
bulk of Sikharulidze’s lecture ad-
dressed those issues and enter-

The Georgian ambassador to the United States, Vasﬂ Sikharulidze,

explains in Posvar Hall yesterday that tension between his‘ country g '

and Russia is almost as old as college students.

The Pitt News 0 wwvy.pittnews.com

A Ambassador: Russian- Georgian

relations ‘complicated’ since '90s

Ambassador, page 1

tained additional questions from
the audience.

Georgia first gained  inde-
pendence from _Russia, which
acquired the country in the early
19th century, in 1991.

The country -struggled for
several years with the difficulties
of establishing a new governing
system, but the most signiﬁcant
changes began with the Rose Rev-
olution in 2003.

“A demonstration with no vio-
lence whatsoever,” the Revolution

‘made way for"political reforms

that are currently underway, said
Sikharulidze.’ ' _
“The new government put
forth a plan for reforms in the law
enforcement sector, the defense
sector, social sector and education
sector,” he said. “The goal was to

_ have a smaller government which

would impose fewer regulations
on businesses in the private sec-

. tor, and since then, 85 percent of

regulations on business have been
abolished.” . I
These reforms led to an in-
crease 'in economic growth for
Georgia, up 11 percent in both
2005 and -2007 and 8.5 percent in
2008, prior to the war with Russia.
Sikharulidze also pointed to
theisuccess of the reforms in the
defense sector, citing the Georgian

_contingents in NATO forces de- ‘

ployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and
Kosovo.
' “I have to now turn to the

more negative part of Georgia’s’

modern history,” said 
“Relations with Russia have been
complicated since the ’90s, when
Georgia 'declared our intention
to work toward aligning ourselves
with Western governments.” .
‘As Russia began to loosen its
hold on the country by allowing
secession rights to small ethnic

contingents, Georgia became more
successful, said Sikharulidze.

The relationship soured, a con-
sequence made more expedient by

growing animosity between the

two countries.

When 1 Russia imposed eco-
nomic sanctions on Georgia, it
hoped to exploit the state’s depen-

' dence upon Russia’s economy to

weaken it, but it achieved‘ some-
thing else instead.

“A very interesting thing hap-
pened,” saidsikharulidze. “Instead
of failing, Georgian businesses he-
gan to market outside the regular
region and found success in West-
ern markets.”

This unexpected victory
strengthened Georgia’s resolve
to move toward an alliance with

Western economies and deepened -
the divide between Russia and

Georgia.
“They practically undermined

Georgia seeks political,

energy in

Ambassador, page 5

every political process with regard
to conflict negotiations and seces-

sion talks,” said Sikharulidze.

The conﬂict peaked this Au— ,

gust with the deployment of Rus-
sian military into Georgia.

“Thanks to efforts made by the

free world, United States and the
rest of‘ the countries in the free
world, they were not able to suc-
ceed in this operation,” he said.

“We are very grateful. to the
U.S. and other states that took a
strong stance against the aggres-
sion and then after the aggression
introducedraid packages to help
stabilize the economy,” he contin-
ued. _

To address his country’s
stance on the conflict with Russia,
Sikharulidze said, “We of course
won’t bow to this type of aggres-
sion and View integration into the
North Atlantic alliance as a goal
of ours.”

In terms of the status of its ap-

plication to join NATO_along with
Ukraine, Sikharulidze is optimistic
Georgia will be admitted, but un-
sure of how soon.

Both countries have created
NATO counsels to help advance
the process toward membership, a
move Sikharulidze cites-» as a dem-
onstration of commitment and in-
terest on the part of Georgia and
Ukraine. '

Furthermore,‘ he identiﬁed
Georgia’s plans to establish an

energy infrastructure indepeng
dent of Russia’s as a selling point

for NATO when considering the
country for membership.

“Right now the major energy
infrastructure is owned by Rus-
sia,” said Sikharulidze. "They are
in possession of not only their
own natural resources, but of
other countries’ natural resources,
and they are controlling the con-
sumers and producers of alterna-
tive energy.”

dependence

Were Georgia to create an in-
dependent energy infrastructure,
the country could supply West-
ern regions on its own, instead
of through Russia, which Sikhar-
ulidze said in the past has cut off
pipelines. '

On the whole, Sikharulidze said A

Georgia’s acceptance into NATO
is simply a matter of time, and his
faith  the country’s future has
been bolstered by its recent sup-
port. A

“I received lots of phone calls
from friends,” said Sikharulidze.
“Sen. Uoe] Biden called the-third,

the day after the ﬁghting erupt-
‘ ed.” .— A

“It was really important to
‘see  President [Victor]
Yushchenko show solidarity with
Georgia during the war and to

hear President Bush and Secretary.
- [Condoleezza] Rice pledge their _

support from the White House’s
Rose Garden,” he said. ‘

EDITORI.AL

Gender and politics,

Randell '4 camme/2t_J .4/sow underly-

ing Jexzldm in Americcziz ‘culture

Gov. Janet Napolitano of
New Mexico enjoys _white-wa-
ter rafting, regularly plays ten-
nis and has climbed Mt. Kili-
manjaro. She’s a breast cancer
survivor, and Time magazine

named her one of the nation’s Al

top ﬁve governors in 2005. And
President-elect Barack Obama
recently nominated her’ for the
post of secretary of Homeland
Security — a job that ‘she would
be “perfect” for because, as a

R single woman with no children,

she would be _ideally suited for
the post, which requires that
you “have no life.”

These comments came from
Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell,
whose thoughts on Napolitano
were acidentally caught on an
open microphone his thoughts
about Napolitano at a meeting
_of the National Governors As-
sociation on Tuesday. His full
quote was, “Because for that
job, you have to have no life.
Janet has no family. Perfect.

She can devote, literally, 19-20 .

hours a day to it.” \

To some, this appears to
be nothing but a simple gaffe,
another example of a politi-
cian ignoring the dangers of an
open microphone. He apolo-

_gized for the comment the next '

day and assured the public that
he meant no harm or offense
and reaffirmed his support for
Napolitano’s appointment.

But regardless, the com-
ments are still indicative of a
larger notion within American
culture that women’s lives are
less.complete when they don’t
have a family, and that being a
wife or a mother creates com-
plications that aren’t' present
i-n the lives of men, even those
who are husbands or fathers.

It’s hard to see ,Rendell’s
comments being applied to
a man, even one who ﬁts the

same circumstances. And" con-
sidering that the two former
Homeland Security secretar-
ies, Tom Ridge and Michael
Chertoff, both had wives and
children, the comment simply
doesn’t- seem to make sense
unless viewed as a sexist com-
ment. _

It’s not difﬁcult to tell that
women are still treated substan-
tially differently from men'in
America today. Media attention
toward‘ women is different, and
expectations are sometimes re-
lated almost exclusively to sex-
ual politics. .

For instance, there was little
question during the presiden-
tial campaigns of the stress
Obama’s candidacy would be
placing on his wife and two
young daughters, . yet Gov.
Sarah.Palin was criticized hotly
for her‘ decision to run for vice
president despite having a new-
born baby. It’s difﬁcult to think
of any reason beyond gender
roles for this double standard.

Rendell’s. - comments
shouldn’t have too much weight
attached to them. It’s possible
to regard them as overtly sexist,
but there’s no reason to doubt
his explanation or to accept his
apology for the remark, espe-
cially seeing as Napolitano her-
self has already done so.

The real concern in_ this '

situation is not the comment
itself, though, but the attitudes
behind it. Rendell’s quip might
have been nothing more than
a gaffe next to an open micro-
phone, but the fact of the mat-
ter is that hisattitude was born
out of a sense of gender poli-
ties that has no place in mod-
ern American society. Rendell
might have apologized for his
remark, but it’s, far more diffi-

cult to apologize for the men-

tality behind it.

Obama's cabinet shows potential

  
   

by Shane Levy

Co/umnidt

President-elect Barack Obama
announced his selections for nu-
merous cabinet positions earlier
this week. Beginning on Monday,
Obama announced his national
security team, consisting of Hil-
lary Clinton for secretary of State,
Secretary of Defense Robert
Gates and James Jones for nation-

al security adviser. Additionally, ‘

Obama chose New Mexico Gov.
Bill Richardson to head the Com-
merce Department.

The Commerce Department,
which deals with, as stated by Rich-
ardson, “job creation, economic
growth, sustainable development
and improving living standards,”
should see its importance in the
Obama administration balloon as

it will serve an unquestioned role‘

in the next ._president’s economic

policy. ~ .
As Richardson stated so elo-.
V quently, “Boosting commerce

between states and ‘nations is not

' . just a path to solvency and growth

— it is the only path.” And he
couldn’t be more right.iMuch like
President Franklin D. Roosevelt
used public works programs, farm
subsidies and other job growth de-
vices to boost the economy, many
pundits are calling on Obama to
implern_ent similar programs to
jumpstart the economy.

If that is the case —— and it is

looking more, and more likely that \
it will be + Richardson will un- '

doubtedly play an essential role in
the development of ‘Obama’s new

New Deal. .

The selections of Clinton and
Gates to secretary of State and
secretary of Defense, respectively,
highlight not only a move toward
a more bipartisanicabineiz, but also
a move toward a more pragmatic
foreign policy. The Obama nation-
al security team shares support for
a responsible and calculated with-
drawal of troops from Iraq.

More than any other mem-
ber of Bush’s cabinet, Secretary
of Defense Gates has called into
question the Bush administration’s
traditional foreign policy. ‘Gates

" has cautioned against a ' military
confrontation in Iran and has been

supportive of responsibly remov-
ing troops from Iraq.

Obama’s appointment of Clin-
ton to be the next secretary of
State is a remarkable exercise in
diplomacy. -

Although Clinton gave up her
much—cherished seat as a U.S. sen-
ator from New York, one cannot
help but believe that her place as
arguably the highest cabinet mem-
ber in the president’s inner circle
during such a critical time is exact-

ly what she wanted — aside from.

the presidency itself.
Furthermore, her place along-

side Obama and _ Biden creates‘
a political force to be reckoned .

with. .
The name Clinton alone causes
a stir among most diplomats, both

domestically and internationally. .

And let’s not forget about her hus-

band, either. A ; _ , ~
Former President Clinton still

carries his presidential name andiis

' an incredibly signiﬁcant force and

well—respected ﬁgure in the inter-

national community.

If anything has been made a"
clear by the appointment of Clin-

ton, who at one point during her
campaign for president employed
some of the sharpest and most
violent attack ads against Obama,
and Richardson, who was also a

one-time rival of the president-

elect, it is that Obama wants to

foster debate and dissent among",

his cabinet members.

Unlike the Bush cabinet, where
many of the top-level cabinet
members -— most notably Sec-
retary of State Condoleeza Rice
—— invariably fell in line with the
president’s positions, Obama’s all-
star_ cabinet team was assembled
for the purpose of challenging
him as president and cooperating
to create more well-rounded and
reasoned policies and legislation as
a result. '

The intellect, experience and
ability of each, of Obama’s cabi-
net appointees allows Obama the
ability to focus on restoring the

,U.S. economy and other urgent

domestic problems.
Having the conﬁdence in
knowing that members of the

cabinet, speciﬁcally Clinton, Gates -

and Jones, are more than qualiﬁed
to handle the foreign and security
policy of the United States with-
out ‘constant intervention by the
president-elect, Obama can rest
assured that the United States’

foreign and security policy will be.
established practically and, more
’ importantly, responsibly.

Somewhere along the line, people
began to hate the intellectual..Popu—

‘ lism took its place as the chief rival of

high thought, and the public marked
ﬂowery  scholastic focus and
words they didn’t understand as con-
 with their common mores
Indeed, my ftiends and I were once
told at a rural diner that the difference
between us and the “common folk”
was that while we had grades, they
had manners

The entire anti—intellectual bent of
folksy America can be characterized
as follows: We can’t trust those fancy
thinkers from their_ivory towers, and
we certainly don’t need their puffed-

/up philosophies

This might seem innocent
enough — just your average, Archie
Bunker—esque ﬂag—waving _— but it:
underiines some very real problems
not only with the state of the union,
but with the state of culture at large

The first drawback of the anti-in-
tellectual position is that it imposes an
artiﬁcial duality, splitting the populace
into the smart immoral people and
the unwashed virtuous people I need
only to hint at the Religious Right to il-
lustrate such  in action. How-
ever, this distinction is plainly untrue
A small—town childhood proves quite
quickly that depravity is easily acces-
sible even if you have a drawl and do
your best to keep the memory of the
Confederacy alive on your mud—ﬂaps.

I would like tolmake some clever

quip about college failing the Caligu-
lan expectations of the country mice,
but’ every so often on a Thursday
night I feel that the horse-loving em-

peror might be proud of our little

school. Nevertheless, small—town
values do not entail greater virtue of
those who profess them; morality can
be summed in wives tales and penned
in gilded tomes _

However, these ethical confusions
forwarded by anti—intellectualism are
somewhat  Yes, they might
have  the previous eight years
of the efforts of Democrats for the

‘White House, but Nov 4, 2008, sug-

gests that this 'ideology has loosened
its grip. We no longer have a taste for
the ,down—home ethic that distrusts
degrees and people who have read
the Marquis de Sade On second
thought, I might distrust the latter but
ofily on account of whatever morbid
endurance it must take to peruse such
literature.

The product of anti—intellectual—
ism that worries me the most, though,
comes out when you hear jaded col-
legiates discussing how college is just
a bunch of ' over-thinking. ‘Movies
are just supposed to be fun. All this
theory is nonsense.” “Freud? ‘Come
on. People are just messed up some-
times” "Ihere is no way Hemingway
wrote_ any theory into his novels. They
are just about war and stuff. He even
said that the fish isijustia ﬁs  Surely
you have heard this anti-rhetoric rhet-

oric before.

manipulation. The minute that soci-
ety writes off intellectual progress as
impossible to relate to, as pretentious,
is the minute that will‘usher in some
new regime of control over society.
When a society convinces itself
that its‘ various concepts and ideas

‘come from some natural folk-knowl-

edge rather than intellectual toil, it
becomes incredibly easy to ﬁlter one’s
own ideas into the social belief sys-
tem. As long as one dresses his ideas
in simple language and with frequent
reference to  the common
man will understand — cars, sports,
plumbing — one can get his ideas

Aworked into the ethos As with most

folk knowledge, these ideas 
lose their origins and become some-
thing that everyone should know,
winning the distinction of necessarily
11116. ~

In a culture that embraces in —
lectualisrn, such a nick won’t work

tellectualism is faux intellectualism

to deceive people when their ‘eyes are
trained on the seams of the social
fabric. A folk mentality clouds such
avision. ~

Now, this should not be read as
condemning folksy life I treat my

rural upbringing as a blessing. How— i

ever, it is a call to not throw the baby
out with the bathwater, to not chuck

. an appreciation of intellectual work

when you dismiss the pretensions of
113.

Furthermore, there is just as much
of an imperative for the popular man
to work toward  the scholar as
visa versa. Although scholars often
do lose their focus on applicability to
real social interactions, their 
toward accessibility must be matched
by an equal effort of people access-
ing them. We must keep in mind that
most of the  we believe trickle
down-from the esoteric works of irn—
possible over—intellectuals The dan-

ger of folk wisdom is that it is sure it ‘
. sprang from the earth. Be very aware

that it didn’t;

Manchester Orchestra'With
Kevin Devine and Dead _

Confederate
Club Diesel, South Side
Saturday, 6 pm.

Manchester Orchestra isn’t an
orchestra — it’s a rock band. And
the five members certainly aren’t
from Manchester —— they were
born and raised in Atlanta.

The band’s name isn’t the only I

thing that’s a bit misleading. The

band’s_ music has been labeled as —
everything from Christian rock to

emo. _
But to. Jeremiah Edmond,

Manchester Orchestra’s drum-‘

mer, labels and misconceptions
just get in the way. It’s really 
about the music.

“We know what our inﬂuences ,

are,” said Edmond in an interview
with The Pitt News. “W/hatever
people think we are, you can’t call
it inaccurate.” .

Founding the band back when
all its members were still in high
school, Edmond and singer Andy
Hull were simply Southern kids
with a love for passionate, genu-
ine rock’n’roll — so much so that
by I-Iull’s junior year they began
making their own.

In 2006, Manchester Orches-
tra released the esoterically titled
I ’721 Like 52 I/z'rgz'n Lming a C/92'/a’,
which started the band on a slow
climb to some serious" cult recog-
nition  very slow. ' ‘

The album was a collection of
tracks with deeply personal and
often spiritual lyrics and music
that split its time being lush and
gorgeous or rough and rocking,
all the while maintaining an emo-

bring him into my world,” explained
Ward about her Search for a way to
incorporate Miller. “Hes actually a

storyteller  and I thought, ‘Story and '

dance: Now that’s something we can
put together?”
After performing, they gained

such an enthusiastic response that the L

pair realized they needed to expand.

“It needed to be bigger than two
people It needed more dance to it,
more live music, and also it needed
to be bigger because there are just so
many stories out there that the West-
ern world doesn’t know or has never
heard of And to really bring those
out, [it needs] to be a full—fle_dged
company,” said Ward.

Since then, the group has acquired
three more dancers: Darcy l\/Iahaffey,
Norm Papernick and Justine Surn-
rock

The group has also gained two.

musicians: Ernay and Nick Ragheb.
All five _additions are from Pitts-
burgh. ’ ‘

Belly  is unique Erom the

precise movements of European
dance. I

“The best way I’ve heard it de-
scribed is that European dances are
very step—oriente<_:l, while Middle

,1 Eastern dance and Latin dance and

Aﬂican dance are muscle—oriented.
And it’s deﬁned mostly by the

isolation_of stomach muscles, hips

and shoulders; there’s a lot of core

work involved It  from really

I peppy-like hip movements to more

snake—like "arm movements and hip

i ' movements,” said Ward

The show itself involves the Ma-
haraja enchanting the Sultan by her
stones. She tells him stories, interrnit-
tently with the main storyteller, and
inevitably brings him into the stories.

Four dancers play the different
parts and change character roles by
using the suggestion of small cos-
tume pieces I

In the future the group hopes to
expand further.

“I think as it grows, we  even
need to "make two -companies,” said

Ward. The group would also like to_

establish itself as a traveling troupe
and go around to universities, offering
workshops and Q&.A sessions about
being a professional performer.

As I walk to class on blustery,
bone-chilling days, I can’t help
but realize that there is a cold-
weather necessity missing from
my wardrobe. '

I have multiple coats, scarves,
boots and sweaters to shield my-
self from the cold temperature,

- and my hands are nightly tucked

away in my pockets, but my poor

-ears are left to fend‘ for them-

selves in the freezing Pittsburgh
air. I need a hat.

I need a hat that doesn’t
make me look completely goofy,
matches most of my coats and is
relatively stylish.

Luckily for me, there is no
shortage of caps this winter. I de-
cided to get a head start by check-
ing out some of my favorite Web
sites. ‘ '

Chickdowntown.com served

as an excellent starting point for

my hat search.

Threehats by Victor Osborne
caught my eye right away. I

. The Black Cloche hat, styled

with a chic, 19205 feel, would be

reminiscent of a character straight

out of "‘The Great Gatsby?’ if the

book . had been set during the
winter instead of the summer._

Inky black fur felt is cut into an
asymmetrical silhouette, trimmed
with a wide ribbon and topped
with a handmade rosette. ’

The Bronze Casablanca Hat
moves into the 19305, channel-
ing old Hollywood glamour into

. another asymmetrical cloche in a

topaz bronze hue accessorized by

- a smooth black leather band.

The third hat ‘by Victor Os-

. borne, the Black Chevron Grecko,

is an update on the classic Greek
ﬁsherman’s hat. Accented with
brass studs, the textured wool is

' banded in shimmering grosgrain

ribbon.

. Lotus is a ﬁve—piece ensemble from Philadel-
phia that relies heavily on pedals and electronic
percussion, instead of any sort of vocals

Hammmirzlée follows that pattern quite nicely
and blends a wide range of styles — from rock to
electronica to jazz ﬁision —— creating an album
that starts off a little mellow, then climaxes with
some funkier stuff before it brings you back
down to earth the same way it took you away

Pitt plays another
tourney-caliber squad

by Randy Lieberman
Staﬂ Writer.

The Pitt men’s basketball team and to-
morrow’s opponent are all too familiar

with the highs and lows of the NCAA‘

Tournament. _

Flash back to four seasons ago, when
Vermont, the No. 13 seed, notched a stun-
ning 60-57 overtime victory against fourth-
seeded Syracuse in the first round of the
2005 NCAA Tournament. _

Now a distant relative of that tourna-
ment team, the Catamounts (4-2) roll into
the Petersen Events Center to take on the
No. 3-ranked Panthers, looking to write a
new chapter of tournament promise of

-their own.

“They’re a very good team,” said Pitt
coach Jamie Dixon about Vermont. “We
expect them’ to be a tournament team.”

Pitt comes in riding an eight—game win-

 

ning streak for the seventh season in a row
and owns a 62-1 record against noncon-
ference opponents at the Petersen Events
Center. ~

On Wednesday, the Panthers (8-0) dis-
mantled Duquesne in the 77th City Game
78-51.

Senior Sam Young paced Pitt with 23
points and added two blocks. Sophomore
center Dejuan Blair had a double—double_5
with 14 points and 17 rebounds. 1 C

The Panthers’ defense stepped up to
hold Duquesne’s leading scorer, Aaron
Jackson, to a season—low six points in the
contest.]ackson came into Wednesday
night’s game averaging 16.6 points per
game. _

It’s something the Panthers will try to
do against a Vermont team that is averag-
ing 78.7 points per game.

Vermont boasts a solid offensive attack

Pitt hopes to knock

off N o. 8 Maryland

by Emily Steiner
Sttzﬁ’ Write/'
The Pitt women’s basketball team has only lost
once this season — a close 56-50 defeat at the hands
of currentNo. 5TexasA&M.Thatwas the ﬁrst

game of the regular season.

T'hreeweeks,ﬁvewinsandanationalranldng H

later, the No 24 Panthers will take on their second
ranked opponent on Sunday season as they play
hosttotheNo. 8MarylandTerrapins at2pm atthe
Petersen Events Center

“It’s always a bigger challenge [to play a ranked
team], especially with someone who’s in the top 10,”

‘ said Pitt coach Agnus Berenato “But our kids will

be motivated. Wehave to playourbestball.”

Last season, the Panthers (5-1) ﬁced Maryland
under the same conditions Itwas  the season,
and they went into the game with a 5-1 record

Pitt lost that game on the road 90-77. But the
Panthers played well later in the game, outscoring
the Terrapins in the second half 49-46.

“We were shell-shocked last year,’ ’ said Berenato
“Lastyear, the kidswereinawe, andldontthink
youcangointo thegameinawe of anyone”

' But it’s a new season, and neither team has lost

much lately.

Thisyear,Marylandhas startedwitha6—1 record
 into last night’s game against Purdue, losing
onlyits ﬁrstgame of theregularseasontoTexas
Christian University. That loss propelled a quick
drop from its preseason NO. 3—ranking. .

Two of the players Pitt will be  out
for areseniors Marissa Coleman and Kristi Toliver,
whom Berenato considers one of the best point
guardsinthecountryandhasthepotentialtorun
a game by herself.

“We haveto really watch her and make sure she
doesn’t open up,” said Berenato

Toliver and Coleman are  16.4 and 15.3
points pergams respectively-

Pitt freshman center Kate Popovec had a break-
out game against Duquesne on Wednesday She
scored 15 points and grabbed 12 rebounds

One of the main struggles Pittwill face Sunday
are the injuries to starters Xenia Stewart and Shavon-
te Zellous, who both left Wednesday night’s game at
Duquesne with sprained ankles

Berenato said that neither player will  able to
practice today but hopes they’ll be clearedtio play on
Sunday

Pitt plays a top-10 team at home this week-
end, and I bet you had no idea.

You probably are aware that the football
team plays its final game of the season at Con-

- necticut on Saturday, in a vital matchup that

will determine whether Dave Wannstedt’s team
reaches the Sun Bowl.

And no, you didn’t slip into an. alternate
universe where Vermont’s men’s basketball
team lies near the top of any rankings, except
perhaps which team Sean Avery has the best
chance to suit up for next.

Who is the mystery team? None "other than
the Berenato bunch.

The women’s basketball program headed

C by Agnus Berenato has reached unprecedented
success in its last few seasons,  its first.

NCAA Tournament game two years ago and

A  in its first Sweet 16 last year.

At 2 p.m. on Sunday at the Petersen Events

Center, the No. 24—ranked Panthers (5-1)
square off against No. 8 Maryland in what
might be the biggest regular-season contest in
the team’s history.

Last season, Pitt played the Terrapins on
the road when they were the No. 3 team in the
country The Panthers, led by Marcedes Walker,
hung ti/ght until ultimately falling 90-77.

This year, the stakes are higher.

Just like in men’s basketball, the Big East is
the toughest conference in the land for wom-
en’s hoops. _

With perennial powerhouses like Connecti-
cut, Rutgers and Notre Dame, along with the
developments of West Virginia, Louisville and
Syracuse, teams will be jostling for position into
late February

Marketable stars play for these programs. .

Huskies Maya Moore and Renee Montgomery

aging 20.7 points per game and has
solidiﬁed her status as one of the
country’s top guards.

Pitt has the toughness, athleti-
cism, star power and coaching to be
among the best The only question is
whether you’ll be there to see it.

While the Oakland Zoo over-
ﬂows when the men play St. Paul’s
preschool, you could {it several large
animals from the other zoo a few
miles away into the student section
when the women play. _

Berenato has singlehandedly
turned her Panthers from a Big East
bottom-feederwhen she arrived to a
top—25 program now, thanks to her

high goals, dedication to detail and a

family environment within the team.
She also openly pines to get any-
one in the seats to cheer on the club,
and she knows the team thrives off
of the home crowd.
Last season, Pitt had two of its
largest crowds when playing top—5

1 teams Connecticut and Rutgers. But
 those schools had a large horde of

but nearly upset the Scarlet Knights
after losing Walker to 

\X/omen’s basketball has a dif-
ferent style and is more slow—paced
than watching Levance Fields speed
down the court to throw an alley-
oop to Sam Young. But that doesn’t
make the games any less entertain-
ing.

Pitt does have playmaker Ja-
nia Sims, but she only played in the
season’s ﬁrst game, a loss to Texas
A&M, and is nursing a knee 
She acts as a Fields~like leader on the
court, possessing the speed to 

I past defenders and ﬁnd the open

shooter. '

Zellous, however, is the leader
of the pack. She elevates high off
the floor on her jump shots, making
her one of the best in the nation at
avoiding defenders and creating her
own opportunities. '

Xenia Stewart is a do—it-all senior
who has played everywhere from
point guard to center as a Panther.
She provides veteran leadership on a

very young team.

But boy, that young talent Pitt
will be a contender for years to come
with this group.

Sophomores Taneisha Harrison,
Chelsea Cole and Shayla Scott all
received vital playing time as rookies
and backups last year. ,Now, Harn-
son is second on the team in scoring
at 11.8 points per -game, while Scott
adds seven points and almost six re-
bounds a game. 1

Cole joins highly touted fresh-
men centers Shawnice “Pepper”
\Wilson and Kate Popovec under the
basket to give Pitt the best depth it
has ever seen.

Pitt has all the elements  place

to make a deeper run in the NCAA‘

Tournament; Last year, it even out-
lasted the mighty men.

All it needs is an insanely devoted
and loud student fan base. So check
the Panthers out before the Steelers
play the Cowboys on Sunday. The
Berenato Bunch would undoubtedly

appreciate it
