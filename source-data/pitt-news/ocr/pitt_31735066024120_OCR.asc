The Panthers blitzed the Cadets

points enroute to a 45-7 victory and
a berth in the Gator Bowl. Pitt, still
‘ hoping for a major bowl , accepted
the Gator Bowl bid to face Heisman
candidate George Rodgers and the
South Carolina Gamecocks in

Jacksonville, Florida shortly after‘

returning to Pittsburgh on Saturday
night. .‘

Pitt knew that, going into the"

game, a big win was needed because
the bids were to be decided after the
action. Thus, Panther defensive
end Ricky Jackson, on- the third
play of the game, intercepted Army
quarterback Bryan Allem when he
batted the attempted’ pass in the air
and managed to hang on at the

For years, People’s Oakland, at

community actiongroup, has been
engaged in a continuing battle with
off-campus Pitt fraternities in cen-
' tral' Oakland. Recently, Sandy
Phillips, coordinator of Peoplefs

Oakland, has cited "three r’r”ater-‘”

nities, Pi Kappa Phi, Lambda Chi
Alpha, and Kappa Alpha Psi, with
noise and zoning violations; E
“In the fall they just have parties,
parties, parties, parties. They go on
late into the night and they’re loud
with all kinds of people coming and
going,” Phillips said. '
But one fraternity member
countered Phillips’ remarks.
“We’ve never had any com-
plaints about noise at our parties

It took the Panthers only four
plays to ‘score when Panther
quarterback Rick Trocano found
Dwight Collins in the left flat for
the Pitt touchdown. Dave Trout’s
extra point made the score 7-0 Pitt,
after only 2:36 had been played in
the opening period.

Pitt’s defense forced Army to
punt and on the first play of ‘the,
Panthers next possession, Trocano
surprised all by setting up in the
shot gun formation. He handed off
to Joe McCall for a big 23 yard gain
to the Army 30 and Pitt was on the
move again.’ But on the next play,
Trocano was hit as he threw and the
pass was intercepted by Cadettfree
safety Chris Zawie.

the Spring term, and we haven’t run

know how it’s going to accomodate

said.

Herward moved to evalute the
campus bus route, which is now in
operation, no later than February
1981.

Bill Abraham seconded the mo-
tion and it carried unanimously.

Board member Scott Hendler ad-
dressed the need for a student food

meeting with Rob, the RSA presi-
dent, about an office for the root:

food co-op before the term is out.”

“I think we need to have a major
planning session,” said Abraham.”
I think we need to make it man-
datory and get as many board
members there as we can, because
the election is over, and we only
have five or six weeks of effective
government left before finals.
There are a no. of projects and
loose ends that we need to clean up
and take care of before the end of
our. term,” he said.

Herward suggested that the
board address the student
Academic Affairs Committe Dec. 2
with their evaluation of the recent
move of registration offices to Mer-
vis Hall.

f‘I can’t imagine them moving

back,” Hendler said.

“They just redid the whole inside
of that place without testing it at
all. It doesn’t look like it is as effi-
cient as it was planned to be.”

“You still have the same problem
with closed classes,” said Herward.
“You have to run from Mervis to
the Cathedral.”

“Either way, I think it’s the.
board’s responsibility as student
representative to give the ad-
ministration feedback about the
new system, to show them that we
do know what’s going on and that
students’ views should be con-
sidered one way or the other,” Her
ward said.

   Opinion

Bill Abraham...
is There
a Better Way?

Those who don’t learn from their mistakes are
destined to repeat them.

Student government president Bill Abraham would
be wise to heed such advice.

Despite his election victory, the mistakes of his
previous administration have not disappeared. In
fact, this year’s campaign served to illustrate the stu-
dent concerns with which Abraham and his new ad-_
ministration will have to deal.

Concerns like:

—curbI'ng the influence of the administration.

It’s fine to have a working relationship with the ad-
ministrators rather than an antagonistic one, but if
you’re supposed to be representing students and your

name becomes synonymous with Andy Smith’s, it’s 4

time to reasses your position. Perhaps Abraham has
become a little too chummy with the higher-ups and
is forgetting about the constituency that elected him.
——the visitation policy. .
During the campaign, nearly all the candidates
mentioned they believed students were dissatisfied
with the policy and wanted a change. At this point,
Abraham should realize that working closely with the
administration isn’t going to change the policy one
bit. A mass violation might be going a little too far,
but it’s better than watching the administration

E112 lﬂilt News

decide how students should conduct their private
lives.

—communication between the SGB and its stan-
ding committes.

Changing the bylaws of standing committees
without telling them won’t help to improve the rela-
tionship between the SGB and its committees. The
SGB should keep open the lines of communication
with its committees but, at the same time, recognize
that these committees are competent enough to run
themselves. I

e The ‘newly-elected board members don’t have the
advantage of being’ given projects already begun by a
previous boardto complete. The campus bus has
been re-routed, the new .food service has been
selected, and the open-air FM station has been push-
ed for. V

However-,"the new members will have to decide
what to do with the excess money from the student
activities fee hike; whether to fund honoraries with it
or save it for when money becomes tight again. ’ L

Also, they must decide whether the student govern-
ment Allocations Committee should become
autonomous or less independent.

We hope that both Abrahamand the new board
keep in mind that student interests are their first
priority when making these and other decisions.

And we also hope incumbent president Abraham
has gained enough experience over the past year not
to make the same mistakes again.

To the Editor:
I

My earnest congratulations to
Bill Abraham and the newly elected
Student Government Board on a
fine effort and a great campaign. I
look forward with anticipation to
1981 with an eye and voice towards
involvement as a member of Pitt’s
student body. Together, the Stu-
dent Government will represent the
entire undergraduate student body
and will work towards our needs in
the community. I foresee great.pro-
gressive changes and a conquest of
student apathy.

I would like to praise those
students who voted and exercised
their democratic right and showed

,that apathy among friends is not so

prevalent. I thank those students
who had the faith and trust in an

 _ obscure candidate to cast a ballot in

his favor. Asa political science ma-

I‘ ~ jor, this campaign experience has

revealed to me. the startling
reality-—I would be ‘better off con-
centrating on philosophy, quietly

' riding my bus, eating peanut butter

and jelly and studying the trial and
death of Socrates. I was just not

tolerate interrogation by the IFC. I
would also like to thank the
Engineering board for being so
typical.

Board Winner
Publicly Apologizes

To the Editor:

In regard to the decision of the
Student Government Elections
Committee (SGEC), or
specifically, my violation of having
posters within 100 feet of a polling
station, I hereby publicly apologize
for this act of mine. I would,
however, like to point out a fact
overlooked by the SGEC despite my
insistence it be included in the
charges brought against myself and
five other candidates for the board.
The SGEC failed to serve notice to
four other violators of the same
rule. I brought the violations to an
SGEC official’s attention, but that
official chose to ignore my findings
and his own witnessed account of
the violators. ‘I ‘would hope that

more .

it is not what I am to believe, then
what should I believe?

15 in Seattle, Washington,
Although Valerie received funding
through the University’s Athletic
«Department to travel to Nationals,
additional funding to send her
coach was denied. Instead, ar-
rangements ‘ '

    

with a coach from a neighboring
school. _ .
We find the fact that Valerie’s
coach will not be going to Nationals
with her regretful. However, after
talking with the athletic administra-
tion, it was disclosed that funds are
not available for this purpose
though in the past they might have
been. Other‘ athletic teams at Pitt
are meeting similar problems. '
While this situation needs to be
looked into further, we are very

glad that at least the university

athletic \department is sending
Valerie tot Nationals. As Valerie
competes this weekend, we extend
our best wishes.

GOOD LUCK, VALERIE l‘! !

own 30, Allem dropped back to

pass and was hit by Jerry Boyarski,
causing a fumble that ‘was recovered
by Pitt’s Hugh Green at the Cadet
14 yard line.
/, McCall then ran for 13 yards to
the one and Wayne Dibartola
scored the second Panther

. touchdown. Trout’s kick made it a

14-0 Pitt lead with about seven
minutes left in the quarter.

TherPanthers scored on their next
possession to’ make it 21-0.
Trocano began the drive by pitching
to McCall for 18 yards to the Pan-
ther 37. Four plays later, Trocano
found Collins over the middle for a
gain of 21 to the Army 26 yard line.
Pitt then got a break when
Trocano’s pass was apparently
picked off by Army. But pass in-
terference was ruled giving Pitt a
first and goal at the seven. Trocano
threw to Willie Collier for the seven
yard touchdown pass.

Pitt once again held the Cadets in
their next possession and Ricky
Jackson came up with another big
play as he blocked Cadet punter Joe
Sartiano’s kick. Pitt recovered at
the Army 29 yard line and Pitt
scored its fourth touchdown of the
quarter five plays later when
Trocano handed off to Artrell
Hawkins over right tackle from the
two. Trout’s conversion made it
Pitt 28, Army 0 at the end of the
first period.

That first quarter had to be the
best that Pitt has played all season.
Even the interception wasn’t
Trocano’s fault because he was hit
hard as he let the ball go. Pitt just
played fine, errorless football for 15
minutes.

"‘We executed extremely well in
the first quarter,” said Panther
coach Jackie Sherrill. “We were
very relaxed and poised.” But

something happened at the beginn- "

ing of the second quarter. Pitt
dame back rather iflitttilarlﬂﬂitlltlitl
seem to be executing as well as the
previous period.

“After that first quarter, it was
hard to get back up,” said Sherrill.
“We played Danny Marino because
he hasn’t played in a while and we
want him ready for Penn State.”

Trocano was intercepted for the
second time of the game by Cadet
Dale -Love at his own 25 yard.line.
Greg Meisner then recovered a
Allem fumble when he was
scissored by Carlton Williamson
and Ricky Jackson. Marino then
came in to quarterback and was
promptly intercepted in the end
zone by Zawie on his first pass at-
tempt since he was injured.

Pitt’s defense held on four downs ‘

and the Panther offense took over
on their 27 yard line. Marino then
constructed a nine play touchdown
drive which included passes of 10
and 18 yards to Collier. The drive
culminated when Marino hit Collier
once again for a 16 yard touchdown
pass. Trout added the point after to
give the Panthers a 35-0 lead.

lfollowing Trout’s kick-off,
lightening struck in the form of
Gerald Walker. One first down at
the Cadet 15, Allem pitched wide
left to Walker who cut back against
the grain and found a hole in the
secondary. He outraced Terry
White and Tom Flynn to the end-
zone and had the longest run of his
career, 85 yards. That lone run was
24 yards more that the Pitt defense
has averaged’ giving up against the
rush all year. The score was. now
35-7 in favor of the Panthers.

On Pitt’s next possession,
Marino was intercepted once again
byiLove at the Army five yard line,
and he returned it 30 yards to the
35. The Cadets were only able to
move to the Pitt 44 and on a fourth
and 16, Sartiano faked a punt and
passed to Andre Cuerington who
rambled for 13 yards, just falling
three yards short of the first down.

Pitt took over at their 31 and
Marino three on seven consecutive
plays, completing three for 37
yards. But Zawie intercepted his
third pass of the game at the Cadet

run by‘ Walker, the Cadets would
have only had 25 total yards of-
fense as the Pitt defense was its’
usual dominating self. - The only
thing the Panthers had tovbattle was
mistakes, which for the game in-
cluded seven interceptions and 100

yards in penalties. Yet, Pitt still was _’

able to-throw for a total of 436
yards and run off 85 offensive

phenominal total of 33 first downs.

Despite "the four interceptions,-

‘ Marino was 20 for 30 with 292 yards
passing. Innfact, the entire passing

attack was 31 for 54. That is by far .-
the most passes attempted by Pitt _

this season.
“We wanted Danny tovthrow the
ball because he had to see the

coverage and maké the right deci-

sions,” explained ‘Sherrill. “It is his

‘first week back and we had to let

him play.”
Pitt began the second half. on

‘was marched off, Army had the ball

Bowl Season: A Glance at the Bowl Pairings

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Sports Editor

With the busiest weekend of
college football completed with the
announcements of the bowl bids,
here’s a quick look at where the
teams will be playing for the
holidays.

Independence Bowl: This will be
played on Dec. 13 to kick off the
bowl season. This also happens to
be the only bowl for which no team
has been chosen ‘yet. The an-
nouncement is expected to take

_place early this week and a good bet

for one of the spots is West Virginia
by virtue of their 24-15 win over
Rutgers. _

Garden State Bowl: A good mat-
chup will take place in Giants
Stadium in the Meadowlands, N .J .
on Dec. 14 between Navy and

Houston. The Cougars got off to a _

slow start trying to repeat as cham-
pions of the Southwest Conference.
But they have since turned it around
and are playing respectable foot-
ball. Navy has beaten Pac 10 (or
should it be Pac 5) champion
Washington this year and will pro-
vide the crowd of probably more
than 80,000 a number of thrills.

Holiday Bowl: San Diego is the
site for this one in which Southern
Methodist University will face the
Western Athletic champion, pro-
bably Brigham Young. BYU, if
they repeat as WAC champion, will
make their third appearance in this
bowl since it was created three years
ago. The Cougars have the nation’s
top passing offense, averaging over
400 yards per game through the air.
SMU has slowly turned their pro-
gram around and, by beating Texas
for the first time in over a decade,
has showed that it is for real.

Tangerine Bowl: This will match.

Maryland and Florida on Dec. 20 in
Orlando, Florida. Maryland last
week defeated Clemson 34-7 to earn
Florida defeated Ken-
tucky 17-15 and has completed a
drastic turnaround from last year
when the Gators were winless.

DYNAMIC - COMPELLING - EXCITING.
WILL STIMULATE voun THINKING!

 

Fiesta Bowl: Penn State will
make an appearance here to play
the loser of this week’s Michigan-
Ohio State clash. Penn State drub-
bed Temple 50-7 on Saturday to
earn the bid. Michigan and Ohio
State are both undefeated in the
Big 10 conference and will fight it
out for a'Rose Bowl berth. But no
matter who loses, the matchup with
Penn State will be a good ball game.

Sun Bowl: This will be played on’

Dec. 27 in El Paso, Texas, and will
feature Mississippi State against the
loser of ’ Oklahoma-Nebraska.
Mississippi State absolutely
destroyed LSU Saturday by a score
of 55-31 to earn the bid. It should
provide an interesting matchup
against either Oklahoma or
Nebraska, two of the_best offenses
-in the country. .

Liberty Bowl: A potentially good _ A

matchup between Purdue and

Missouri will take place on Dec. 27,

in Memphis, Tenn. Both teams
haven’t played up to their potential
this year, with Purdue losing to
Michigan 26-0 and Missouri to
Nebraska 38-16. "But both are ex-
plosive offensive clubs and can
score a lot of points. This will be an
exciting game.

Hall of Fame Bowl: Birm-
ingham, Alabama is the site for this
game on Dec. 27. Tulane is match-
ed with Arkansas after both teams
won their games on Saturday.

Arkansas defeated Texas A &\ M _

27-24 and Tulane won over Mem-
phis State 21-16.

Gator Bowl: Pitt will play South
Carolina in Jacksonville, Florida on
Dec. 29. The feature will_ be the
matchup between Pitt’s number-
one rushing defense and South
Carolina's Heisman. Trophy can-
didate George Rogers. The Gator
Bowl people must be very happy to
have a’ game with such notential. ,

ismnocom-:qi.:euyaoes About His Job

opening game of 1980 as the star- 

_ By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Pitt News Sports Writer

In life they are laborers, in foot-
ball they are offensive linemen.
They are the men who go quietlY
about their jobs with the knowledge
that the glory and acclaim will fall

- upon others. If it can be said that

the laborers are the backbone of
society, then the offensive linemen
are the backbone of a football
team.

After a game, it is routine to see
reporters crowding around the
lockers of the McMillans, the

‘Trocanos, and the Collins. It is
these players who make the game
beautiful with sparkling plays. The
offensive linemen are usually the
first showered and the first
departed. Theirs is a lonely job.

Even if their rewards are few, it is
still these men who dictate the flow
of the game. The McMillans, the
Trocanos and the Collins would not

have become who they are if it
weren’t for the play of the line.

To the uneducated fan, these
linemen appear to be merely big
brutes trying to block other brutes.
Strength would appear to be the on-
ly prerequisite required to play.
This couldn’t be further from the
truth. “Playing the offensive line is
the hardest position to play next to
quarterback,” coach Jackie Sherrill
commented on the subject. .

The complexity of the position
necessitates athletes who are big,
fast, and intelligent. Jimbo Covert
is one such athlete.

The season in nine games old and
the Pitt Panthers have been vic-

atorious eight of those games. The

offensive line has had a large part in
this success. This line, which has
been praised by many coaches and
singled out for its brilliance, has
controlled the line of scrimmage
and made movement of the football
easier and successful.

Jimbo Covert is a member of this

line. He was never supposed to be.
Recruited originally as a defensive
tackle, Covert played a lot as a
freshman. He started the first game
of the season as a sophmore against
Kansas. He appeared to have a
bright future ahead of him. As so
often happens, however, Covert’s
career was threatened by an injury.

VA huge red scar on his right
shoulder is the only reminder of
that injury. Covert took a redshirt
last year and came back into spring
camp this year as a defensive tackle.

For Covert to start he would have
to crack a senior ladden defensive
line. A year on the bench would be
a hard pill to swallow. The defense
was set but the offense, especially
the offensive line, still had many
questions to be answered.

Jackie Sherrill had to deal with
heavy losses due to graduation. A
left tackle was needed. Jimbo
Covert wasted no time.

“I saw there was a vacancy at

tackle and I thought I could do the
job,” he said. “I respect coach
Sherrill very much for letting me
switch over.”

Covert had all the size and
strength needed to be an offensive
lineman. At 6-foot-4 and, 264
pounds, he had to learn the techni-
ques of his new" position and that
would take time to learn.

“I found it difficult because I
couldn’t play with the reckless
abandon that I could on defense.”
Covert said. “I had to learn to use
my hands to pass block and not to
rush.”

If the techniques were hard to

' grasp then the blocking assignments

were the toughest to learn.

' “It’s much tougher on the offen-
sive line because every play has a
different assignment.” he said.
“You have to know who to block
on every play.”

Withia crash course in offensive
line principles, Covert entered the

ting left tackle. Young and
untested, Covert was apprehensive
about the contest.

“I was very nervous that first
game. I wanted to do well, but after
that first hit everything was okay,”
he said. '

The nervousness disappeared and
was replaced by a young line that
grew stronger and stronger. The run
blocking, that was criticized early in

the season, began to click while the ,

pass blocking remained excellent.

There are no more problems with
the line. Covert is satisfied with his
new position and wouldn’t mind
staying there.

“I would love to play line the rest
of my years at Pitt,” said Covert.-
The transition has been complete
for Covert. Certainly there islmore
to be learned, there always is. But
for now Covert has filled a huge
gap in the offensive line and has
done it with style.

Steelers Keep Playoff Hopes Alive, l 6- l 3

By The Associated Press
._ Terry Bradshaw’s second
touchdown pass of the game, a
3-yarder to Lynn Swann with 11
seconds to play, lifted the Pitts-
burgh Steelers to an emotional
16-13 National Football League vic-

tory over Cleveland yesterday that
kept them in the playoff picture.
The Browns, 7-4, their five—game
winning streak snapped, appeared
to have the game won at 13-7 when
they staged a goal-line stand with
less than three minutes to play.

They took an intentional safety
with less than two minutes to go,
making the score 13-9, and a free
kick gave the Steelers, also 7-4, the
ball at their 46-yard line with 1:44 to
play. '

Bradshaw, who opened the scor-

freshman sensation Hershal Walker
will go against the tough Irish
defense. .

Cotton Bowl: SWC champ
Baylor will make its first ap-
pearance at Dallas Jan. 1 in a long
time. The Bears have but one loss
this year and will play Alabama,
despite the Tide’s two loses this
season. This game won’t be for any
title, but will nonetheless be a good
one.

Rose Bowl: Washington will play
the Big 10 champ, either Ohio State
or Michigan, on New Year’s Day in
Pasadena. The Big 10 would like to
end» the reputation of always losing

~ this game, as has happened many

times during the 70's. The last ap-
pearance Washington made was a

few years ago when quarterback 1

Wally Moon led the Huskies to a
big win. The game has lost much of
its prestige due to the Pac 10 proba-
tions of five schools, but will be a
good matchup anyhow.

Orange Bowl: In a surprise move
to many, Florida State was selected
to either Oklahoma or Nebraska in
Miami on New Year’s Day. Qlf
Nebraska is the Big 8 champ,

it will be a re-match of earlier this
season when the Seminoles defeated
the Huskers 18-14. If Oklahoma
wins the conference bid, it will be a
re-match of last year’s game when
the Sooners ran all over State. But
Florida State is much improved
over last years 11-1 team so this will

" be a highly publicized game.

Peach Bowl: This game will be
played in Atlanta on Jan. 2 and will
be between Virginia Tech and an as
of now still undetermined team.
Virginia Tech has been among the
leaders in total defense this season
and should provide a stern test for
whomever they play.

These 15 games contain 30 of the
best teams in the nation this year
trying to add a happy ending to the
season. The happiest will probably

be the winner of the Sugar Bowl ,

since that is expected to decide the
national title. If something should
happen to either Georgia or Notre
X€ "'still must play
USC on Dec.6) then the Orange
Bowl could become the focus of a
number of attention.

ing on the first play of the second
period with a 10-yard pass to Jim
Smith, whipped the ball 24 yards to
Theo Bell at the Cleveland 30, and,
three plays later, fired 23 yards to
Swann at the Browns’ 6.

Then Bradshaw, under intense
pressure, threw incomplete just
before Cleveland defensive end Lyle
Alzado fell on him. _ Bradshaw
limped off with 25 seconds to play,
then trotted back onto the field. A
defensive holding /penalty against
safety Clarence Scott moved the
ball to the 3, then Bradshaw found
Swann open on the left edge of the
end zone for the winning score.

-The Browns cut Pittsburgh’s ear-
ly 7-0 lead to one point when
quarterback Brian Sipe marched
them 87 yards in 11 plays, the last a
4-yard scoring pass to tight end’ Oz-
zie Newsome. Holder Paul

McDonald fumbled the snap on the
extra point attempt.

But when cornerback Clinton
Burrell stole a Bradshaw pass, his
second interception of the game and
one of four against Bradshaw by
the Browns, Sipe put Cleveland in
the lead 13-7 with a 15-yard ﬂoater
to Dave Logan with 4:12 left in the
first half.

The biggest play in the Browns’
go-ahead touchdown drive came on’
-a fourth-and-three situation at the
Pittsburgh 37-yard line. Johnny
Evans, the punter, sprinted up to
the scrimmage line, took, the snap
and handed off to Dino Hall, who
burst around right end for 19 yards.

Merino Not DscouragedBecause oflniuryi  

By JOANNE BENTELER

Pitt News Sports Writer

/\ Just because Dan Marino is
“down, don’t count him out.

“Being on the sidelines is
depressing in some ways because
I’m used to playing and playing
without injury,” said Marino. “But
I have a lot of years left to play
football, so I have to put it behind
me.”

Marino damaged the cartilage in
his knee against Temple.

“I made a cut and it went out on
me,” he said. “It happened again

- against West Virginia, only worse.”

To strengthen his knee, Marino

uses heat and a whirlpool. He also

uses the orthotron and rides a bicy-
cle. This rehabilitation is helping
him and he hopes to have no further
knee problems.

Many feel that Pitt’s offense is I

more balanced with Trocano, even
some of the players.

‘‘I don’t feel that way.” he said.
“It makes no difference who’s
quarterback. Trocano’s ‘running
game is better because the offensive
l1‘ne’s blocking has been excellent
recently. They were not blocking
well for the run while _I was in
because we concentrated more on
the pass.” '

Thinking about bowl bids,
Marino would like to play in the
Sugar Bowl against currently
undefeated Georgia. ‘ But being
ranked number one when it’s all
over is a bit unrealistic.

“If Pitt wins big and a couple of
other teams get knocked off, we
have a chance at number one,” he
said. “But that would take a

miracle. ’ ’

tried to pick up\a first down on

Marino said.

Marine is confident he will break

By breaking the passing record as
